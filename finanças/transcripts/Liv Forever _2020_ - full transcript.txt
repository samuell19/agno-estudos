Have just experienced so many things that I've never thought I'd ever be able to experience. I knew when I was gonna be a wrestler, I was gonna change the cycle. This kind of violent, destructive, aggressive, angry out of life cycle, where it's like, you think you're set up to fail. You don't think there's success at the end of it. You just think like, well, this is what I'm gonna be. But I didn't think that. I was like, no. This isn't gonna be my life. I'm gonna make something of it. And that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna be in WWE. Hey! You know me. Well, you know me as Liv, but my real name's Gionna. Oh my God, Gionna. You see these cameras? They have been following me for the last 18 months. What a roller coaster it's been. This story is full of twists and turns. And the ending, well, that's a surprise too. So let me take you on a ride. I object! The ride of my life. My journey in WWE has been anything but usual, from the Performance Center to NXT. And of course being a member of the Riott Squad, with Ruby and Sarah, they're my best friends. We had some success from Evolution, to Super ShowDown in Australia and even WrestleMania. But, if we're gonna tell this story, I think it's best we start here. At the Superstar Shake-up, in Montreal. We weren't ready. We weren't ready for it. That was a very sad day. It was a hard day. No one told us anything. We thought we were on our way to being Tag Team Champions. And then we go to TV and Liv's being moved to SmackDown. We just went like, " huh!" It was just unexpected because we felt like, we had so much left to do together. We barely even scratched the surface. I get the goosebumps. We were just getting our groove. And then, that was that, it was gone. If superstars and teams are split up, so? I know where you're going with that. That's not an option. There was no payoff. There was no closure for us. Yeah, it was definitely unexpected. It was just a day, man. Is a day still I don't know quite how I feel about it. It's still not over. That day is still not over. I felt a little bit like it was my fault because I had to go get surgery. They knew, what it's like to travel the roads with someone and only know this company with them and only know this world with them. And then that was gonna change very abruptly. I felt for Liv because she was going to SmackDown on her own. And so there you go, two years with the Riot Squad and just like that, it was over. We never got to the heights we hoped. We didn't become Tag Team Champs. We broke up. Just found out I'm going to SmackDown. And I know I look really sad. I am a little bit sad. But I'm happy. I just thought when I started this journey, I didn't want to be in a tag team. And I didn't expect Ruby and Sarah, to just become such a huge part of my life. Like my best friends, my sisters. Now that I'm in this room with them, I can't imagine ever getting off of it. And I'm excited for new opportunities for them and for me. But this squad is so real. You guys don't even know. And I'm gonna miss them and I wanna be with them, but I'm excited to go back to SmackDown Live, where it all started for me. I'm gonna miss my friends. So that's how I feel right now. I just wished that, we could be together forever. But it wasn't forever. And that was okay. This was the chance I had been waiting for, ever since I was a little girl. Every family has issues. Like I'm five years old and no one's checking to see that I've done my homework or no one's checking to see that I'm even passing school. And I was like left to my own devices, really, really, really young, when I didn't even have a grasp of what being a responsible adult is supposed to be. I had no one telling me anything. I just was watching what was in front of me, which was my brothers who were angry and upset at life and destructive and mean and abusive. And my mom who has all these kids by herself, just tryna hold it together, as best as she can. It was hard, financially very hard. I was working 60 hours a week. So most of the times we were above water, but there were times when it just didn't work. My mom, who was a waitress, worked hard. Working 60 hours a week, my mom tried. She had to. In 1994, my father passed away of a heart attack, just three months before I was born. So I was raised by a single mother and it was us, all seven of us, including my brothers and sisters. I lived in the suburbs. I went to a good school, Elmwood Park Memorial Middle/ High School. Cause that's what it was. It was a middle/high school. We'd want walk to parties. And I was a cheerleader. I'd do the football games and my social life was the most normal part about my life. It's like, not even my friends really knew what my life was at home. They didn't know the other side of me, which was like, the girl that's in her room with wrestling on the loudest as it could go. Because of the commotion that's going on outside the door. A secret. It was like a secret, my home life sucks and it's a secret, but it also was like my normal. So I was able to really take it on the chin because that was my normal. I knew it wasn't normal, but it was my normal and my tolerance for it grew so high that I appeared to be okay. I didn't realize how much I needed someone to give me some structure. And it's just something that I was lucky enough to realize when I was so young, WWE gave me a purpose. I watched it, knew I was gonna do it. And so I shaped my life like, how am I gonna get there? There's just things that you just can't explain, but you can feel it. You just can't explain why you feel this way, but you just, something inside of you and I was like a five years old and I put on WWE, my brothers were watching it and I watched it and I just was like, I was like, wow! I just knew that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna be in WWE. And I watched and I thought they were amazing. I thought the physicality, the stories, I was completely in awe by it. So much that my brothers and I, we built like a little makeshift ring in the backyard and we would wrestle and we'd do entrances. And it was their dream to. Ever since she was a little girl, it was always about wrestling. Wrestling was a big thing in our household. We didn't have much at that time. So I built a ring for her in the backyard with old cushions, from the lounge chairs, sticks from a pear tree. And I went to the store and I bought 200 feet of laundry line. It became the after school event. And that's where they wrestled. That's where she started. And she's been wanting to be a wrestler forever. That dream became my mission. When I dropped out of high school in 2010 during my sophomore year. Got my GED and across the street from the GED center was the Hooters. And I was like, damn, I just got out of high school. I need to make money. "I need to start getting things going." So I was like, I'm gonna work at Hooters. I went in there and I applied, I got hired and I loved it. Hooter's is great. It gives so many opportunities to women. There's so many little things and Hooters aside from just being a server, there's the beauty pageants. And there's the calendars. Like I was in the calendar. Hooters not only gave me a job, but gave me an opportunity. Something I needed at that time. It was the first time in my life I had responsibility. Even if it was as simple as making sure your wings were hot and your beer was cold. I took it and ran with it. I started working out and got in the best shape of my life with the help of Joe DeFranco, who has trained high level professional athletes, including Triple H. Soon after I got a try out with the one place I had dreamed about, WWE. In the summer of 2014, I got the call from WWE's Head of Talent Development, Kenyon Simon. I seen email from Kenyon and he's like, "your phone's not working, call me." And I'm like, I thought I was in trouble, I didn't know. So then I call him and I'm like, hello sir, sorry. He was just like, "it's okay." "How's your weekend going?" It was 4th of July weekend and I was like, it's going good. And he was like, "I just wanted to call" "to give you some good holiday news." "We wanna give you a contract." And I was just so blown away. I was so blown away. I couldn't believe it and I reacted just like how I'm reacting now. I started crying and my brother knew from that, just from me crying that I got signed. So my brother's in the background screaming, Kenyon's on the phone like, "do you need a minute?" 'Cause I'm hysterically crying. I'm like, no, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm listening, I'm listening. And all of us went crazy. We were just nuts, we were like waiting for the cops to come. 'Cause it was just crazy. We were so happy because she wanted it so bad. And from then on, it was just like tunnel vision, like going to WWE, going to WWE and that's, yeah, yeah, that's how it happened. I did it. I was 19 years old and heading to Orlando, Florida, to the Performance Center as the newest WWE signee. I can't paint the PC in a better light. That to me was like my home, that's how I learned everything at PC. I learned everything at the PC and the coaches were so patient with me 'cause I was a 19 year old girl that thought she knew everything. So they were patient. PC is a pure place in my mind. It really shaped my work ethic. We worked so hard. Your first couple of months learning how to work are intense. People don't realize how hard it is. I couldn't really walk. I was tired all the time. My body was so beat up and I've got to be focused because you're retaining so much information. It was so hard. It was very pivotal years for me, in my just development of being an adult. I know what you guys think when you look at me. That I got here based on my looks. That I have no talent or drive. The mirror room at the Performance Center, was kinda like your mirror at home, that's why it's called the mirror. Go home, look in your bathroom mirror and talk to yourself and see the faces that you make and see how you say it, examine what you're looking at. Because if you don't like it, fix it. Very, very, very pivotal for learning how to do promos for sure and they'd go and they count how many mirrors you did. And like, "oh, you only did like three mirrors all month?" "Do you think you're that good at promos?" "'Cause you're not." And it's like, you're held accountable. Like do your mirrors. You wanna get promos do your mirrors and so I was in there all the time. The most fabulous diva, and an ex-diva. Even if I wasn't great, I was in their the whole time just talking about what I had for breakfast. And with Aliyah just talking shit about everyone. I'm kinda getting some libido messages here. Hmm, okay. It's a tool. Learn how to talk and learn to see what other people see when you talk. Bye. In 2015, I finally had my first match. It wasn't televised, but the cameras did capture me afterwards. - Aah! - Yeah! Let's just say my debut or whatever you call it, was the first of many learning experiences. So proud. That was crazy. Oh, man. That was so much fun. Over the next three years, I tried different characters and techniques. Every year I got better in the ring and on the mic. Then the next step came on November 21st, 2017. That date is forever for us. We got it tattooed. And we were in this together. I went from being there with Bayley, Sasha, Charlotte, to being like the longest tenured person there. We finally got called up. And we had no idea what show we were going on. I got a mass email with yada, yada, yada, yada, yada. "We need you to come to Raw to do a dark match." And then we show up and we get sat in a room that no one knows we're in all day. And Triple H and McMahon walk in and they look at Sonia and Mandy and they just tell them, "you're gonna debut on Raw tomorrow with Page" "as the Heel Faction." And they're like, "Oh my God!" They look at me, Ruby and Sarah and he was like, "you're gonna debut on SmackDown as a Heel Faction." And we're just like, "okay." He looks at us and said, "congratulations you've made it to the main roster." And all of us are like internally dying. 'Cause we're just shaking. We're so excited. But we just wanna remain cool and calm and collect. And we're just sitting there and he can see it in our eyes. He can see that we wanna just freak out. And so he stands up and he goes, you guys can freak out now. And as soon as he gave us permission, we all shot up and just started hugging each other and crying and yelling. And the Riott Squad was born. It was Ruby, Sarah and me. We are all here on the SmackDown with a champion. Oh, Sarah Logan. Not only did we bond on screen, but off screen to. Traveling the world together we quickly became huge parts of each other's lives. We're like, "how can we make the most out of this?" So we went to the ring every single week. And made the most out of whatever we did and we had a hell of a time doing it. ♫ Runs to give me booze ♫ Wait a second. That's it, it's the Riott Squad. ♫ That's what we waiting for ♫ ♫ Hey hey ♫ ♫ Its all behind us now ♫ It's just weird how we meshed so fast and just how strong our bond became. We were way more alike than we ever could have thought. We looked completely different. We couldn't look more different actually. Get out of the way. I remember Sarah feeling nervous that I wouldn't feel included in the group, that I wouldn't feel part of, but it just happened so naturally and so fast. I was like, I'm gonna get these girls to like me. And they did. And now I have a lifelong friendship. Okay, that was a lot. But all of that shows you my journey and brings us back to the week the Riott Squad was dissolved. I was sent to a new show, SmackDown Live, or as I call it SmackDown Liv. And now I was on my own. So before I was in tag team, I didn't think I was a tag team wrestler. I didn't wanna be a tag team. I was like not mad about it. But I was determined to shoot my shot with these two girls. And I did it for two years, and I fell in love with them. Sure, your gonna have that forever. So then if you have a way of working with those guys as a ready-made story and you've got ready-made reports, so you'll help each other out when you work together. It's good stuff. Also though, definitely all my work ethic is split. Yeah but- - I have these two girls with me, but now that it's like solely based on me, I'm like questioning my work ethic and my abilities in the ring. All that's gonna change and all that's gonna go up is your cardio. I know, I know. Why to vet you and like, then you get to work with other people and build those relationships again. And you're young, which means there's a lot of future. You've got nothing to worry about. I didn't see her for weeks and weeks. And I would text her every week. You got anything this week? "Nope." Got anything this week. "Nope." I keep getting told I have something. I keep getting told I have something big in the works and it just wouldn't happen. I know both me and Sarah have both tried every week to explain to her, it's gonna happen. They're saving you for something special. It's gonna happen. But we can always tell someone that so many times, before we don't believe it ourselves. I feel confident today. One week became two weeks and then a lot of weeks, it was three months. And in July, 2019, I finally got my opportunity and returned to action against The Queen, Charlotte Flair. She's gonna miss out. I'll text her to call me. Hey Gionna. Hey. What's going on? Ooh, I'm debuting tonight. You what? I'm gonna be on SmackDown tonight. Yow hoo! Are you thrilled? Yeah. For real? Yeah. You are doing a match? Aha. Oh my God Gionna, you are debuting. Oh my God. I know. Oh my God, all right. Yeah, just watch it. I love you, I gotta go. I love you too, bye. Bye. I finally made my debut on SmackDown. I spoke up in a town hall meeting. I called Charlotte out and we had a match, which ended up to me setting off on a journey to find myself. Liv Morgan go up against the eight time champion. Look at Morgan go! Morgan is gonna end in a big way tonight if she can knock off Charlotte. Oh, wow! I think Charlotte Flair came into this match underestimating Liv Morgan. I Absolutely think she did. Liv Morgan had said to Charlotte Flair, "Because of people like you, it's why people like me don't get opportunities here on SmackDown Live." Listen, again, I have a lot of respect for Liv Morgan. For coming out here and making her own opportunity. Okay, she can- - Charlotte was right, and when I come back I'm gonna be real. That felt so good. I cried at the end of my match. Because I'm so happy. Those were real tears. I feel like in my promo my emotions just came naturally. I am already ready for my re-debut. So I had my first singles match and it was a success or so I thought. He's gonna park for me. I lost me, I lost me. Where am I? She's not lost. She thinks she'd be lost without the Riott Squad, but she's not. She seems even more focused. And I like it. She seems really like, she knows where she's going. She's got direction now. Hello. Before she could be reliant on the girls, but now she's very focused to herself. Selfie. And I can't wait to beat her in the ring tonight. What are you talking about? Don't you ever! I'm not saying nice things about your dude. It was weird, traveling every week, renting cars, getting hotels, going to TV, not knowing anything. And just there's so much uncertainty, because it didn't necessarily feel like, it was in my hands, I was ready. Do you not have anything for me? I was ready to go. Obviously you get paranoid. You're like, am I doing something wrong Is there something that I don't see, you start worrying about your job, because you don't know why you're not being used. What week is this? What week is this? I don't know, I feel like you've been gone for awhile. Wow. It's pretty good. I know right? I was pitching tons of characters. I was pitching, I'm more dark. In my perfect world, I was gonna play this character that I worked so hard writing about and studying about. Writing out like really deep, dark feelings that I've had, maybe that I suppressed and revisiting because that's what this character was gonna be. She's gonna be like this tortured soul, but so passionate and just dark, but like beautiful. It was the slowest burn ever. Over the next couple of months, I waited and waited until I got the news in September of 2019. All I got told really was, "we want like a strip down Liv." Less makeup, less distraction. So I played it safe and I was like, I'm gonna just go back to blondes. No one's really telling me anything of what this new look should be. So I just took it upon myself and I just dyed my hair blonde. Oh, that's awesome. Oh boy, oh boy. I feel like a Pokemon, I just evolves. I don't know what the name is, but this see the final form I think. Are you excited? Liv Morgan versus Ember Moon in a dark match. I've been off for however many months. I've been going to the PC. I have new moves. I've been watching tons of tape. I have a very good sense of self. I know what I'm doing. I know who I am. I'm gonna have a killer match with Ember Moon. I love working with Amber. She brings out the best in me. She's not scared to go. She's competitive and I'm competitive. So we just have a competitive match. Oh, woo, woo, woo! Thanks Mike. You've bloomed. From Emmy. Okay. Her name's Ember. Say it right or you are out. Embie. Do I get like a little bit of credit? - Yeah. - Okay. - BAM, BAM! - Yeah. Oh my God, I have new gear. Where's Mike? I had new gear. I knew what I was gonna do. I was super excited. I was back blonde. I just dyed my hair blonde impromptu, didn't tell anyone. And I think I'm gonna have a match with Ember. So I'm ready to show my down. I'm like, okay, I wanna show everyone like, look hey, this is what you've been missing out on this whole entire time. And I'm doing like my pre-match ritual. Like I'm bout to go out there. Like in less than 45 seconds, I'm gonna walk through the curtain. Hold up, this match is canceled. - Micheal stop it. - I swear to God. You swear to God? Then out of nowhere, I just hear Michael Hayes, and he's like, "Liv can't go out there." And I was like, and I thought they were joking with me. I was like, are you just like ribbon me? So I'm not ready? I don't know. I don't know what's going on. Hey there. I can't believe this is happening, like 30 seconds before we're supposed to come out our match gets canceled. That was it, it was bizarre. It was bizarre. I was super ready to go perform and I wasn't let out. So I didn't go out. It turned out that I was not supposed to be exposed to this crowd, not in my final debut form. So pretty much I couldn't do this dark match. I'm not to be seen until I debut back on WWETV. I was shocked, but I was like, it was encouraging, because the boss didn't want anyone to see me. You know, not on TV and find a form. I was like, oh cool. I'm not forgotten about, everyone's still cares. We still care. We want my new debut and character to stay under wraps until it's debut. So I kinda took it as a good thing, like, oh cool. They're still thinking about me. They don't want me to go out there and expose what we've been working on, or what I've been working on. So I ended up like taking it as a little bit of a positive. It was positive, even though I didn't wrestle that night, I felt the momentum was going my way. A few weeks later, in October, another pleasant surprise. I was sitting at home during the draft, watching the draft on TV. And the final pick of the 2019 WWE draft, Monday night Raw selects Liv Morgan. Guys in the NFL, this pick would be called miss irrelevant because it's irrelevant about when you get picked. It's what you do with the opportunity. This is a pick of true potential. That's a great word potential, lining up Liv Morgan. Liv Morgan, now apart of the Monday Night Raw. Okay, I'm going to Raw, and it was televised. So it's a big deal, right? It's a big deal. Like they want people to know that Liv's going to Raw. And so I took that as a positive as well. I was like, cool. I'm gonna debut. Go to Raw. I was back to square one again, back on Monday Night Raw. But this time I had someone in my corner. What did I see in Liv Morgan? A confused kid who can't find her way in life, that has dreams that are defined in her head that she can't articulate or convey to her friends or the masses. But is chasing an indescribable dream that only she herself can truly understand. And there are so many people out there just like that. My daughter is a teen and she always tells me, "stop trying to define me." And that's what we, as an entertainment company try to do. We tried to define every character with absolute. And here is the exception that defines a rule because Liv can't be defined and she doesn't want to be. Because no one that age, wants a label placed on them. I got a FaceTime from Paul Heyman. Tells me this is your debut. And I'm like, yes, because you know, none of my pitches worked. None of anyone else's pitches worked, I'm about to debut, what is it? And he, to sum it up, says that I will be crashing while I'll be in Lorna's wedding and revealing myself as a past secret lover of Lorna. The thought process was to re-debut Liv in the biggest way possible. Marriage is a garden we sow. If there is a man or a woman- - Liv this is your moment. This is your moment. With just course, why these two should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever, and I do mean forever, hold your peace. Bobby, Lana- - I object! The love of my life is right there. I'm not talking about Bobby. I'm talking about Lana. All my nails broke. When you look at a blank piece of paper and you start writing this stuff out, or now on a computer screen or on your phone, however you write things. I still look at a blank piece of paper and then you start to put the elements together, oh, and then this twist and this turn, and then you see it happen in front of your eyes. And it plays out in front of a live audience with millions watching at home and however many in the arena watching it live and the oohs and aahs and the twists and the turns and it plays out as well as it did. And Liv and Lana delivering the way that they did. That's a high that you get as a writer, director, producer, whatever the title is, that is afforded in the genre of entertainment. That to this day, I haven't been able to convey to anybody that hasn't lived it themselves. I got told we're going with Liv is undefined. She's an undefined character. As we kept going, I kind of lost more and more sight of who I was supposed to be. I'm getting the most spotlight I've ever gotten since I've been signed. This is not the time to not look confident or strong on TV, but it was very hard just because I just didn't believe in myself. Some of you saw the news broken earlier today via WWE social and digital platforms. WrestleMania, this year, two weeks from Sunday, April 5th, will not be taking place in Tampa, Florida, at Raymond James stadium. Instead it will emanate live here from WWE's training facility, the WWE Performance Center. WrestleMania with a crowd in the arena I was supposed to be in, was not gonna happen anymore. Because we are not allowed to have an audience. So WrestleMania is completely reworked and we're having it at the Performance Center, with no one there. The audience have a little match. But I just found out about yesterday. I just had a match with Nattie. And Nattie's always been so helpful and so gracious. And she's a great teacher. She just gave me my first WrestleMania victory. It's pretty sweet. It doesn't feel real. It doesn't feel real. I'm just thankful. It's cool. When I think about how far I've come, I think that's what just keeps me so grateful. And I think it keeps me like grateful till it falls a little bit. I'm just happy to have my dream job. It's always worth it. I feel like it's always worth it because it's the journey. This is the journey. I mean, I guess some people would like showing up and then just being pushed to the destination. You know what I mean? Like I'm showing up and I think I'm crawling, I'm crawling to the destination. It's gonna be a steady crawl and it's gonna be a consistent crawl. It'll keep me moving forward. And then eventually I'll be at the finish line. It's consistent and I'm trusting the journey and I'm trusting the process. And I'm gonna crawl, I don't need to run. I'm gonna crawl. But I'm gonna get there and it's gonna be worth it. And it's gonna be earned. So, it's all good. From wrestling in my backyard to the grandest stage at WrestleMania. From the beginning, this journey has always been about one thing. So I do have four older brothers, one older sister, one younger sister. This really makes being here so special to me. And I just wanna be great and I wanna do so well here. I wanna make my family proud. They need someone to make them proud. It's really grateful to be here. The sky's the limit, and she's gonna make it happen. Remember me telling you this. Definitely, it's all you Gionna. And your family will always love you, no matter what. When Gionna was born, she was born early. She was born at 28 weeks. She's "my peanut". It makes me proud that through it all, she made it. She made it. I'm just so proud of her. For all the challenges in the last year and a half, I was at peace. Sometimes life can be funny. And the answer was right in front of me. My answer, maybe what I thought was in the past, wasn't ready to be in the past. We still had things to prove. But as of recent, we've been given some time to really show what we mean to each other. Right back to where I started kind of. The squad's getting back together, Ruby and I at least. I mean, Sarah's always gonna be a squad. Calling it the Riott squad without Sarah seems wrong in some way. But at the same time, I know Sarah is supportive of anything that we do. Ladies, a little help please. Oh no, Morgan and Riott. The Riott Squad going off to The liconics. They know that now that we are being given ball, but they're never going to see it again. Because Liv and I are too hungry to let The Riott squad fall through the cracks of history. We're not letting that happen again. What would 26-year-old, Gionna, say two, six-year-old, Gionna? I say like, relax, be a kid. Because whether you know it or not, you're gonna do everything that you wanted to do. So be a kid, don't be scared of no smile, make friends be social, have fun. It doesn't always need to be the weight of the world on your shoulders. And you're gonna do great things. You're gonna do great things. And most importantly, you're gonna grow up to be a good person. And you're gonna have everything that you wanted. In the last 18 months I have grown. I am more patient, more confident. ♫ Do you wanna really live forever? ♫ Through the highs and lows, I am still that little girl with a dream. A dream to save my family, to break the cycle, to be a success. ♫ I feel like we gonna live forever ♫ Liv Morgan is here, forever. Riott Squad's gonna make history. We are going to be in the Hall of Fame one day. Ideally, one day with Sarah, again, after she's busy being an amazing mom. We are going to be something somebody remembers, whether they like it or not. So this all has kind of come full circle in a weird way. I started this journey with The Riott Squad and I'm kind of ending this odd chapter with The Riott Squad. There's no way I'd do anything that I didn't believe in. ♫ Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh ♫ And now I feel like I have a refresh. 'Cause now I'm back at my starting point. I have a rare opportunity to rewrite history. ♫ Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh ♫ I'm right back to where I started. ♫ Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh ♫ So now where I go from here, ♫ Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh ♫ I can make it whatever I want it to be.
