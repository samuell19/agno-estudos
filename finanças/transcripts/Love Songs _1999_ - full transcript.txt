[upbeat music playing] Champ! Hey, baby, what you want? Here you go, Champ. Thanks. Hey, Champ. Oh, check this out. Oh, how you like my left hook? Get to school, young blood. A'ight. Champ: Sheron, I'm home. Hey, baby, breakfast is on the table. Mack just called. Oh, and Aisha's picking me up today. - Uh-huh. - [chuckles] What did Mack say? Did you fix my coveralls? Mm-hmm. I fixed 'em. Thank you, baby. - So what did Mack say? - Uh, let me see. He said something about some fight. Something about a fight. Well, let me see if I can quote him correctly. I believe he said, "You got the Juarez fight." Yes! Yes. I may be late getting home today. We got in-service. Mm-hmm. Otis, come on, baby. Don't eat so fast. Baby, you want me to starve to death and be late? - He said I got it, huh? - Uh-huh. I hope it's a bigger payday than the last one. Mack got most of that. I don't see the benefit of getting your head beat in, not for that kind of money. All right. But Juarez is a contender. He's number six, WBG. He's number five, IBO. Yeah. I got to go, baby. Take care of Little Champ for me. Hey, now, what if it's a girl? Then she's going to be a boxer, like her Daddy. [laughing] Otis? What should I tell the gas company if they call before I leave? Tell them we'll pay them on Friday. [door closes] Mmm! Mmmmmmm! [laughing] We could always sell that car. Not in your lifetime. [laughing] Sell you? She must be crazy. [both laughing] [horn honks] Otis, you're late! This is the second time this week. I got three cars waiting since 7:00 in the morning, and nobody to fix them. You're costing me money! Bay number one, they need a valve job. Bay three needs her oil changed. Get in there and get to work! [sighs] You need points and a new oil filter. Is that all it needs? Miss Jean, you need a new car! Are you prepared to give me new-car money, Otis? [chuckles] If not, I'll just keep bringing this piece of junk over here for you to fix. By the way, how's Sheron? Fine. You know, we're expecting in January. - Is that right? - Yeah. Congratulations. [chuckles] I have to admit, Otis, I never expected you to amount to much of nothing. Oh, the way you used to carry on. [telephone ringing] People can change, Miss Jean. Hey, Champ! Big time manager of yours on the phone. Don't talk all day. You women are hard to work for, boy. I'm coming. Don't talk all day. Hey, Mack. I got it. About time. When is it? A month? How am I supposed to get ready in a month? Juarez is a contender. I need six, seven weeks at least, Mack! Substitute? All right. I'll take the fight. They'll see when I knock his ass out who ought to be in the rankings. No. No, I'm fine. When are you coming by with the contract? Yeah, I'll be home. Thanks, Mack. Don't tell me that crooked manager of yours finally got you a fight. Yeah. He did. Juarez. Number six. A month from now. It's a sure thing. And I should knock that punk out in three. Yeah, we'll see. Just don't be late for work. Sunny. One of these days I'm going to come in here, and I'm going to buy this place from under your ass. Make sure I'm living when you do it because I'll be dead by the time you get that kind of money. [laughing] Hey, Champ! Yo, Champ! When you get a minute, I need you to look at this truck of mine. The bitch was sounding like she had diarrhea on the way over here. Give me 20 minutes. I got a couple of cars to finish up first, all right? - All right? - [horn honking] He is the loudest, most vulgar man in this neighborhood. I wish somebody would tape his mouth shut. Ellis ain't so bad, Miss Jean. At least he's got his own business. Having your own business does not mean that you need to pollute the whole neighborhood with your nasty mouth. Children walk past that truck on the way to school. How much did you say? I'll give it to you for $9.50. See, here's the part I know you and the missus are interested in. Says right there-- you'll get $6,500. $6,500? That's less than last time. How much of that are you getting, Mack? Baby. Come on. No, I want to know. How much is he taking while you're doing all the work? Champ, will you tell the missus who books the fights, who pays for the training, equipment, the doctor, the cut man, the sparring partner. Will you tell her, please? Why does this happen every time I bring a contract over here, Mrs. Barnes? I've been in the fight game 35 years, never cheated nobody. You think I'm cheating him? Well, we can forget it. I'll step off. Mack, Mack, Mack, sit down. Sit down, man. Baby, let me handle this, okay? Okay? Okay. But I'll be back. Go on, man. What were you saying? What were you saying? Now, see this? This is a guarantee that if you beat Juarez, you'll get a fight with Tony "The Terminator" Hudson. - Tony's number three! - Mm-hmm. Baby, you hear that? Me and number three. Now, I'm going to take Juarez out in one. In one, Mack. In one. All right. Just sign it right here, Champ. Yeah, he win this one, you'll all be off Camac Street and moving to the suburbs. Mm-hmm. Just a minute, baby. I just-- I want to read it first. Mack, she reads everything now. Uh, I never told you this, but Sheron worked in a lawyer's office before she was at the hospital. - Three years, didn't you, baby? - Mm-hmm. You want a cold beer? No, I got a couple of cold ones in the refrigerator. Come on, man, come on. What kind of gas mileage do you get with that Caddy, Champ? Uh... 12, 13 in the city. Huh. Mack, uh... Look, here. Do you think you could give me an advance? Like $700, $800? [chuckles] I ain't got that kind of money, boy. Besides... what's your woman going to say when she finds your purse is short that kind of money? You know, you really ought to do something about that. I been married four times, and I ain't never let no woman get in my business. Uh... What about $300, $400? Thanks, Mack. Forget it. You just remember, you owe Mack Richard everything, Otis. We'll be cool with the gas company, baby. Why do you do it, Otis? Do what? Take his money. Let him talk to you like that. Baby, what can I do? I did 13 cars all week. You know what my check is when I bring it home? $385, take home. We owe the gas company, telephone, mortgage-- $73.50 for the baby. I'm-I'm-I'm-- Get another job. Baby, sit down, sit down. I'll get it. I'll get it, baby. Baby, I don't want to be a gas jockey for the rest of my life. I'm a fighter. And these hands are our way out of here, Sheron. I can-- I can beat Juarez! All I need is a chance, and Mack can give me that chance. I can see it. Me coming down that aisle to the ring. Announcer's voice: In the blue corner... "In the blue corner, wearing the white trunks with the red trim... ...he enters the ring... ...he enters the ring with a record of 21 wins, all by way of knockout, the WBG, IBO Middleweight champion-- Otis "The Cadillac" Barnes! And dig, baby, you and the baby are going to be sitting ringside, and I'll be in my corner. I'll just be standing there, and I'll wave and blow you a kiss. Yeah, yeah. And then the ref will come over and say, "Do you understand?" "Yeah, I understand the rules." Then the bell will ring, and then... Yeah, yeah. Bip, bip, bip! He's down. Ooh! The crowd is on its feet! The ref-- "Eight! Nine! He's out! Barnes wins again!" I can see it, baby. My name up there in the sky... way past the sun... like a ball of fire. Can't you see it? Mm-hmm. Sometimes. But what about right now, Otis? Because we're in trouble right now. Just... just give me until the Juarez fight. If I lose... I'll quit. I swear. I'll get rid of Mack, get a new job-- all of that. Okay? Please? Please? I love you, baby. I love you, too. Sunny, I am giving you my close-friend rate, baby. All this stuff is 18-carat gold. I can get $300, $400 apiece for this out on the street, but I am willing to give it to you for $30, $40 each. I'll give you $15 for all of it, Bunchie. Take it or leave it. And what you wearing a preacher's collar for? Who's going to look at a preacher in a department store, huh? $15? Give me the $15! [laughing] Hey, hey, hey, get that crap off of my car! Hey, Champ! My man! Word is on the Avenue that you sweated that manager of yours into getting you a fight. I know you want to buy that lady of yours a special little gift now. I ain't got to sweat nobody to get me a fight... thief. Whatever. And I'm a businessman. Check this out-- 100% silk. I'll give it to you for $70. Huh? Who told you that? About me sweating Mack? Huh? Perfume, huh? Coffeemaker? I got a crystal salt- and-pepper set straight out of Tiffany's, man. Take your money, Bunchie, get the hell out of here before the cops come and bust me, which would not be good for you! Aah! Who told you that, Bunchie, huh? Chill, brother! What you look like hitting a preacher, man? The bartender over at Larry Neal's bar, Reuben-- he told me. He say Mack say you all washed up, but you worry him to death, and says he know you so long he gets you on the card after Busta Turner broke his hand, man. Sunny: Be cool, Champ. Yeah, yeah, be cool, Champ. Be cool, Champ. Be cool, Champ. You are washed up, and I hope Juarez kicks your black ass! Git! Take it easy. What's wrong with you, young buck? You see me drive in here. If you think I'm washed up, let me stretch your ass, Mack, huh? Huh? What's wrong with you, buck? You better chill! I come over here with a deal, and you gripping me all up. I'll take the four grand and step off. What four grand? The money you could make sparring with Billy Monroe. Now, if you don't want it... Billy "The Cannon"? $800 a day, five days. Now, he's training over in Jersey for his 12 with "Tiger" Whitman. They had Kermit over there, but Kermit tore a ligament in his arm. Now, you want the gig or not? Hell yeah. I'll call you with the where and when tonight. If you ever put your hands on me again... I'll shoot you. Man: Come on, now. Hey, you the guy Mack sent over? - Uh, yeah. - Tony Ricco. Otis Barnes, but everyone calls me Champ. You can change in the locker room. Listen, did Mack explain the situation we got here? He said you needed a sparring partner for "The Cannon." Well, yeah, yeah, we do. Listen to me. Now here's the deal-- no knockdowns. I mean, no matter what. I don't give a damn if he's kicking you in the nuts, poking your eyes out. You knock him down, the deal's off. You get nothing-- no money, no nothing. Clear? Otherwise, it's four grand for the week. But that's the deal. Take it or leave it. Can I at least hit him back? I mean, or is he too delicate for a straight right hand? Listen, I know it's a lousy deal, but a lot of people got a lot of money riding on this, you understand? He gets a busted nose, a cut over his eye, then his chance is gone, and this is his only chance. - Now, you got me? - I got you. All right. Locker room's down there. - See you in five minutes. - Okay. [laughter] Hey, y'all, look at the new chump they sent me. Hey, chump. Ready for an ass whipping? Yeah, yeah. [chuckles] Cannon, I want you to work on your jab, okay? Keep him as far away as possible. Now, straight out, right from the shoulder. One-two, okay? Then step back, reset for two more, okay? - Time. - [bell rings] Showtime, chump. What you got? What you got? All right, now, speed kills. Speed kills. Watch out. Bam! I call that the misfired cannon! Oh, that's supposed to be funny, huh? You call that a jab? Oh, you ain't seen nothing, baby. Mm-hmm. I call that Cannon's right hook! Looky here, looky here. We got us a bad Philly fighter. Come on, bad Philly. Eat your gloves. Man: Damn, did you see that? Man #2: No. Who is this guy? - You got lucky! - Time. [bell rings] This chump's trying to make me look bad. I said time, damn it! [grunts] - Come on. - What! What! You want me? Come on! Come on! Come on... - [answering machine beeps] - Sunny: Champ, this is the last damned time I'm calling. If you ain't here by 11:30, you're fired. I got four cars lined up over here. I mean it, Otis. 11:30 or look for another job. Sunny? Sunny? It's Sheron. What, Otis isn't there? He didn't come in at all? No, he went out of here this morning. Sunny, don't fire him. Something must have happened. Otis doesn't do things like this. Hey, Champ. How you doing? Feeling sore? A little. So, uh... what did you think? How the hell did he get to be the number-one challenger, anyway? Uh, don't ask questions, okay? [chuckles] Otis, what happened? Where have you been, baby? Mmm. You know, Sunny's been calling here all day. Says she's going to fire you. Let her. I don't need that chump change she's paying. I got me a new job, baby. Making 800 big ones a day, and all I got to do is not knock the punk out, which I could. I don't know how he even got to be the number-one challenger. What are you talking about? Baby, I'm Billy Munroe's new sparring partner. Billy's getting ready for the Tiger Whitman fight. What about the job, Otis? You can't just walk off and leave Sunny hanging like that. I'll call her tomorrow, I swear. But, baby, this is a chance for me to make some real money, pay off some bills, buy some baby stuff. Plus this is a good place for me to be right now. There's a lot of reporters down there, TV. Somebody big could see me, give me a shot. And I'm 10 times better than Monroe. 10 times. [chuckles] Well, leaving her that way still ain't right, Otis. [exhales sharply] - You okay? - Mm-hmm. - Okay? - Oh, he must be a boy. He kicks as hard as you punch. Look. - [laughs] - Mm. Ooh! - Okay. - Sounds good. Yeah, I'll walk around you. All set. Got this one. One more. - Man: Got everything? - Man #2: Yeah. Thanks, man. - Hey, what's up, Champ? - What's up, baby? Otis, now, you said you needed some bread, young buck. Don't let his teasing mess up your money. Now, all this is just for show, anyhow. Yeah, come on up in here, boy. Let me show these folks what a chump looks like. Look at you. Look at you moving like a little old woman. Keep that up, I'm going to have to stick you in your ass. Maybe that'll get you going. Tony: Cannon, I want you to counter in there, okay? You understand? Everything he throws, I want you to counter. Everything. That'll be easy. Because Philly can't fight. Can you, Philly? Time. [bell rings] - Otis? - What? What's up? Nothing. Don't tell me "nothing." Is this your new way of coming in the house? Because you know, if it is, I'll pad the front door and put something down on the floor so you won't break anything in your bag. It's not funny. Then what is it? Nothing. Sheron, just leave me alone, okay? Okay. It's nothing. [breathes sharply] Can I at least talk? [grunting] Good. Because, you know, if it's nothing, then you won't mind my saying that it's a whole lot of something to be called nothing. They think they can just walk all over me, Sheron. That damn Mack. Just jammed in. They got me jammed in. And there's nothing I can do about it. [sighs] Can you talk about it? No. Can I have a hug? I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Tony: I don't want to hear a goddamn thing, Cannon! Now, listen, buddy-- I got you this fight and you take what I say you take, or your ass is out of here! You got that? You said I'd get 75% off the top! Now I'm getting 40%! What am I supposed to do with that? I owe everybody, Tony! I told you, man. There are other people involved in this. The more you spend, the more they take. Billy, that was the only way I could get you the fight. You ain't worth a damn, Tony! Well, it was the best I could do, Cannon. You want a shot, you got to pay for it. This is boxing-- not basketball! Man, forget you! Come on, chump. I'm kicking your ass this morning. Hey, Cannon, I want to see you body-punching today, okay? Clean, short, sharp punches to the body, all right? Kid, I want you to counter him, okay? When he throws one, show him what he's not protecting, all right? Come on, Philly! Time! [bell rings] Come on, come on! Look, I know what you're going through, man. Why don't you chill out? All these fight promoters are the same. You don't know nothing! Get up! Get up! Get up, chump! Get up so I can knock your ass back down! That's enough. That's enough. Pull it back. Pull it back. Come on. Back it up! Hey, hey! What if the press was here, huh? You trying to blow everything we've worked for? The hell with you! And you too. Cannon, get back here! Cannon! You okay? You feeling good? Get the hell back in here! Jeez, I'm sorry, kid. Look, I'll pay for any damage to the car, you know. I don't know what got into him. I... [sighs] Baby, you coming to bed? In a while. I just need to think. I'm all right. Why don't you go back to bed? You need to get your rest. I can sleep tomorrow. All day, if I want. I'm off till Sunday. It's going to be okay, Otis. You just got two more days. I know. It's like my daddy used to say... When you feel like you're sailing alone, you're usually in the same boat as everybody else. You're just in a different part of the boat. That boy Monroe's no better off than me. He just don't know it. But boat or no boat, I can't take much more of it. I'd rather be sunk than disrespected. You know what I'm saying? I'm sorry about your car, Bad Philly. I ain't saying I did it, but-- I figure, we can take care of whatever it costs you to fix it, you dig? It's the best I could do, kid. He ain't exactly the type to apologize. All right, Cannon-- overhand lefts-- jab, overhand left, jab, overhand left. Kid, I want you to counter him, okay? Time! Hey! This is for my Cadillac. Get the hell out of here! You get nothing! Get out of here! You hear me? Get out! Are you stupid? You just blew four grand. Get out of my face, Mack. Well, I'll get out of your face. And your life! How do you think this makes me look, huh? I'm through with you! You hear that? And you can kiss that Juarez fight goodbye! Otis? What you doing home, baby? They fired me. I just couldn't take it, Sheron, them messing with me-- I couldn't. And I don't know what we're going to do. I ain't got the money... no job... nothing. I'm sorry, baby. So sorry, baby. [sobbing] Come here. Come here. Otis, you listen to me now. You listen to me. We're going to make out, okay? Fighting ain't everything. And you're a good mechanic, and I still got my job, We got each other. And the baby... and that's all that matters, Otis. That's all that's ever mattered. You hear me? [knock on door] Hey. Uh... Mack told me where you lived so I... I just wanted to come by and say you did the right thing, kid. After the Whitman fight, why don't you look me up? South Philly. Fumo's Gym. You're good. Real good. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Ellis: Wa-a-a-a-a-termelon! I got porgies, croakers, crabs, sweetest tomatoes this side of Jersey! Freshest fruits and vegetables on the Avenue! Collard greens-- two pounds for a dollar. Can't get them for that on a Jersey farm. How are you doing today, darling? I've been looking for a fine woman like you all my life! Yeah, right. Just give me a couple pounds of these porgies, please, Mr. Ellis. And tell me something-- you don't even take a day off? You're on the corner seven days a week, man? And if the week had eight days, you'd see me on eight of them, darling. You can't make no money taking days off. Eh, true. Now, I'm going to give you a bargain on these fish because you look so good today. Hmph. Look at the gills. If they're nice and red, you know they're fresh. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, so, I'm going to give these to you for... $4. - You want them cleaned? - Yeah. You ain't got no turnip greens this week? Turnip greens? Here. Taste that. So sweet, you may not even have to cook them. Huh? Huh? [chuckles] You ever taste anything that delicious in your life? I got kale, I got mustard greens, I got okra-- so soft, feel like a fine woman's thighs. [laughs] Miss Jean! You lookin' mighty good today, Miss Jean! Come on over. Please, Miss Jean! Please come on over! I got big, juicy Georgia peaches. I got bananas-- look so good, didn't even want to pick them. Saved them just for you! Okay. There you go. That's $4. Thanks. Jean: What are you charging for these bananas? For you? 25 cents a pound. Well, give me four or five of them, and I want them green so they don't go bad overnight. You want me to throw in a couple pounds of them peaches? No. Mmm-mmm. But I will have some of these plums, though. Don't you say it, Mr. Ellis. I got to, Miss Jean. You do, Mr. Ellis, and I swear I won't buy a thing. A'ight. But you know what I'm thinking. [clicks tongue] I got string beans today. So fresh you can hear them snap two blocks away. Come on, girl! Stop playing with me. Boy, tie your shoe. Quick. Fix it. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Look at this. Come on. Ellis: I'd never treat nobody like that. Somebody need to kick her old man's ass. Don't need to be with no woman you got to beat up every day. Mm-hmm. That'll be $1.50, Miss Jean. Oh. Anything else I can get for you? I got big Jersey tomatoes. I'm tired of y'all bringing your mess over to this job where I work. You want Larry to find me? Where else was I going to go, Reuben? This is closer than the house. You've got to stop bringing it over to my job. Oh, that's a shame. Do you have change for a $20? Oh, yeah, sure. You know how I feel about you, don't you? Mr. Ellis, I'm tired of hearing it. Please just give me my things so I can go home. You got pretty hands, Miss Jean... Pretty face... Pretty body... When are you going to break down and give me some? You watch your nasty mouth, Mr. Ellis! I am not one of these lowlife women, just strolling this Avenue, waiting for somebody to just buy them a drink, some bum or something! Now, don't you dare talk to me like that! - You understand? - Yes, ma'am. All right, now, get out of my face and give me my change. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. [laughing] She's a fine piece of meat, ain't she? Meat? Who are you calling meat? Get out of here, Bunchie. - Hell, man. - And don't touch nothing. I'm a customer. Now, are you here to sell fruit or are you here to disrespect the folks that's making you money? I don't need your business! And watch what you say about Miss Jean. You know, she always seemed uptight to me. I used to see her in the mornings when she taught at... Showell's-- Smith, and I thought to myself even then, you know, she needs a good man to just give it to her a few times. Get away from my truck, Bunchie! Hey, I'm trying to buy some peaches. I ain't selling you nothing! Well, screw you, that woman, and your peaches! I'll buy my fruit at the supermarket where it's fresh! - Don't you throw that! - Go on, Bunchie! Git! I'll report you to the Health Department. I'll be back! No, no, I tell you. How are you ladies doing? I got lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, green beans, string beans, collard greens. I got peaches... "When are you going to give me some?" Vulgar, that's what he is. How in God's name would anybody pay attention to a man like that? Hmm? [sighs] [telephone rings] Hello? Mm-- [groans] What do you want, Stanley? No to lunch, no to dinner, no to everything. Because you're married. Don't call me again. Bye. [telephone ringing] No, I'm not going to. [humming] I thought I'd bring some beautiful flowers for a beautiful woman. Would you get off of my street? You're going to wake everybody on the block! Don't you know I love you, Miss Jean? Shh! I'll see you next Saturday. No, you won't! Go! [laughing] Yeah! [grunts] Whew! [chuckles] "Please forgive me. Ellis." How can you be so smart about some things and so damn dumb about everything else? Hey! [chuckling] Hey, Ellis, how you doing, man? - What's happening, man? - A'ight? You're looking good. - Thank you. - What's up, my man? Getting the usual? - [clicks tongue] - I got it. So, how's your wife doing? Still big? - Here you go, my man. - Hey, hey. You, uh, making any money? Yeah, tons of it. I just wear these work clothes to hide my wealth. [laughter] Ah. So, how long you been married, Reub? - Me? - Yeah. Oh, let's see... Damn! 16 big ones, my man. - Mm. - Hey, Reub, give me another shot of Grandad so I can go out here and face that dragon I'm married to. That'll be $4.75, Crumley, and you'd better stop talking about that woman long as you been married. Why do you think I need that second shot? [both laugh] Ooh. Hey, Ellis, what's the matter, man? You having trouble with Miss Jean? Man, I don't know what to make of that woman. I send her flowers-- that don't make no difference. - Uh-huh. - I tell her I love her-- that don't make no difference. I even cut her a lot of slack on the price of my fruit, even that don't make a difference. Never says "thank you." I'm about ready to give up. Oh, no, no, no, no, Ellis, listen to me. See, there is a key to every woman's heart-- and they're all different-- but you just got to find the right one. - [chuckles] - But once you unlock it, you may be sorry. [laughter] Well... I'm not so sure I want to keep looking for it. [gasps] No, please! Don't! No, please, no! No! No! No, stop! No! No. You don't want to do this. Please don't do this! - Shut up! - No... please. Yeah! Looky here! [chuckles] Help! Agh! Somebody! Help! Man: Hey, leave that woman alone! It's psychology. Most people cook onions with potatoes. You put them both together, they buy both. Now, I might be interested in going to this party. Who all are going to be there? You and who else? Eh, just a few neighborhood people. It's Dottie's 40th birthday. Bring your own liquor. So, you wouldn't mind coming to pick me up, now, would you? Pick you up? We may not get there, sugar, - fine as you look. - [laughs] So, listen. You hear about Miss Prissy, right? Jean Simpson. Last night, they say some fool tried to rape her. Said all she had on was her slip, too. I didn't know that about her. Oh, my God! Where's she at? Is she okay? Say she's in Allegheny, down on Broad Street. What's the matter with you? I gotta go. What about all this stuff here? You keep 'em! Sell 'em if you want to! But I'm on my way to work! What about the party? - Where did he go? - Down some hospital, I guess. I don't know why he's so worried about her. And he left you all of this stuff to sell? Excuse me? Do I look like some kind of huckster to you? I have a good job to go to, you know. Oh, excuse me. I got potatoes! Turnips! Onions, tomatoes, greens! Fresh from the farm! Doctor, how is she? - Are you a relative? - No. But we're friends since grade school. Can you get in touch with anyone in her family? She was conscious for a while when they brought her in. She told us her name, but all her ID is missing. She suffered severe head injuries. - Is she all right? - She's stable, but we're watching her. Can I see her? She's in no condition to talk. Her jaw is broken, and she needs rest. In a few hours, maybe. Uh, you can wait if you like. Thank you. Woman over P.A.: Would the person who owns the Heavenly Vegetable truck parked in the middle of the hospital driveway please come to Security Station Number One on the first floor? [yawns] Can I see her now? Not for long. 10 minutes at the most. [monitor beeping] Oh, my God. Miss Jean? It's me, Mr. Ellis. I brought you some flowers, Miss Jean. My God... I don't know if you can hear me... But when I heard about it, when I heard what happened... I almost went out of my mind. You just got to get better, Miss Jean, 'cause I think it would kill me, Miss Jean. It would kill me if anything ever happened to you. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. How are you doing today? [laughs] Yeah. Hmm. Yeah, I'm sorry, Miss Jean. I didn't realize. It does look like a funeral parlor in here. I just wanted to do a little something to let you know that-- let you know how I felt about you. You know, you got to be more careful on these streets out here. You want me to get rid of all of them? I promise I won't send you no more flowers. But how are you going to take care of yourself? You must be feeling your oats, ain't you? Yeah, I know. I wish you were out of here, too. But your doctor said you should rest. I'd take his advice if I were you. Um, there's not much going on on the Avenue. When I came looking for you, that damn Bunchie took the vegetables that I left. He tried to sell them. Can you believe that? I hear there's some guys looking out for him. I know I'm going to break his neck when I catch him. Stanley: Am I interrupting? Jean. Oh, Jean, darling. I just heard. What-- what happened? - Who are you? - I'm Stanley Williams. Jean and I have been friends a long time. Are you a friend of hers from the neighborhood? I appreciate you coming by to see her. I was in Atlanta when I got the call, and I called the house. When I didn't get an answer, I knew something was wrong, darling. You her boyfriend or something? Yeah. Yeah, see you around, Miss Jean. - [hits bed, grunting] - Looks like you two need your privacy. [sighs] What did I do? The man asked who I was, - so I told him. - [buzzing] What's wrong with you? I come to the hospital to see you, and this is how I get treated. What's the matter, Jean? What's wrong? Why are you so upset? - You have to go, sir. - Wait, Jean, don't do this. - Sir, you have to go. - Don't do this. Now, sir! Hey, kind of early for you today, ain't it, man? Why don't you give me a double Grandad? Double Grandad? You don't drink whiskey, man. - I said a double Grandad, didn't I? - I'm... Why are you beefing me about something as simple as this? ...not going to give you no double Grandad, man. 3:00 in the afternoon and you're drinking? All right, all right. Hey, baby, give the man his usual beer. What's wrong with you? The man want a double Grandad, sell him a double Grandad! Crumley, I'm not talking to you. Now, mind your own business, hear? - What's up? - There's nothing up. You messing with his First Amendment rights, Reub. The Constitution gives him the right to order any drink he wants! Crumley, shut up. Ellis. Hey, Ellis. We're friends, right? How long we known each other? Talk to me. - Here I am, man. - Yeah. I'm courting this woman. She already got a man. [groans] I feel like a fool, man. I feel like a goddamn fool. - I'm sorry. - I knew it was a woman! What else could drag him in here at 3:00, as much as he like money? All right, Crumley, out. I ain't finished my drink! Out! No, go ahead. Let him finish his drink, man. - I'm going to get out of here. - No, Ellis, please. I don't need to get drunk, man. I don't need to get drunk. You be cool. I'll catch up with you tomorrow. Hey, hey, hey, Ellis. Ellis! I'll take you down, Jean. Oh, be careful. [chuckles] Here we go. Are you sure there's nobody coming for you? Ellis: I got watermelon! Cantaloupe! Watermelon! Cantaloupe. I got peaches! I-- I got collard greens, mustard greens! Turnip greens! Okra! Right here. What can I do for you, miss? [chuckles] Well, why didn't you say something? My jaw was wired shut, Mr. Ellis. Rushed out of the room so fast, you didn't give me time to write my note. Well, how was I supposed to know? I mean, the man's standing there, and he's just... Wow. You're really pretty today, Miss Jean. So, are you selling vegetables here or what? I waited for you till 10:00 the other night. How come you didn't pick me up like you said you would? Something came up, sugar. Ooh, I can see that. Well, girl, I don't know what you did to him, but he dropped a box of turnips, left half the vegetables in his truck on the street to run down to that hospital to see you. So, are you going to pig out with the fruit, you going to buy some? What you going to do? Give me a pound of okra and a few of them tomatoes, please. And don't bother getting hot with me. I ain't mooning over nobody, honey. Just give me $1.50, okay? If all you're going to do when you come around here is spread gossip, you can go ahead and buy your vegetables from the supermarket. Mr. Ellis, that is no way to treat a customer. You tell him, girl! He needs somebody like you, sugar. Might soften his cranky old butt. Did you? Did I what? Did you rush down to the hospital to see about me? I told you. I came right away. I want to thank you. If you're not... doing anything on Friday, would you be interested in a home-cooked meal? I sure would. Okay. Can you be there at 7:30? Oh, yeah. Now, let me have, uh... a couple tomatoes... three pounds of potatoes... Do you have any kale today? Yeah, I sure do. But fruit's my best buy today, Miss Jean. - What you going to cook? - That's my business, Mr. Ellis. You just show up. I will. You don't have to ask me twice. - [laughs] Oh! - You okay? [gasps] [exhales sharply] It's okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - [both laughing] - [smooth jazz playing] Yes? [chuckles] Come on. You're so sweet. - What's up, Jimmy? - Not much. How are you doing? Hey, pal. Hey, hey! - What's happening, Jim? - Hey, how you doing? - Hey. - Hey, how you doing, Jim? This is Miss Jean. Reuben, what's happening, baby. - What's happening, baby? - Hi. Hey, Reub. Buy these two lovebirds a drink on me. Do it while they still friendly. - Y'all heard Crumley. What'll it be? - Thanks, Crumley. For me, uh, I'll have a beer, and, Miss Jean? I, uh... I think I'll just have a ginger ale. You got it. Hey, baby girl, give my man here his usual beer and give the young lady a... ginger ale and put a cherry in it. [laughing] Hey, brother. Hey, man, I understand that... you two are heading toward the preacher. Mm-hmm? No, don't rush us, Reuben. You know, it takes a long time to know somebody well enough to marry him. Ooh! Oh. - There you go. - Thank you. What else you got to know? I mean, uh... I own my own business, right? Own a house over on Bucknell Street. Another one in Germantown. - Mm-hmm. - Got plenty of money in the bank. Treat you good, don't I? Mr. Ellis, there's more to it than that. Like what? And when are we going to stop calling each other mister and miss? Don't get loud with me in here around all these people. I'm not used to it. Well, come on, baby, I'll get as loud as I want to! Hey, don't put your business-- Back off, Reuben! What you got to do with this, man? - Nothing, okay? - Okay. - Nothing. - I am not going to be a part of any kind of bar argument. Whoa, Jean, baby. Jean, Jean! Jean! Hey. All of your houses, your money in the bank, your businesses don't mean anything to me. It's what's inside you that counts. - Come on, hey. - No! I am not a rug to be walked on. Now, until you understand that, you can just drink your beers all by yourself! Okay, fine! I will! 'Cause there ain't a woman in this neighborhood who wouldn't be glad to have what I got! And I did it all by myself! Playing me cheap. I mean, what else a woman got to know, huh? What else you got to know? I can take care of you. You never have to work! Then you go tell me I ain't worth nothing. - Find somebody else. - Hey. Why don't you sit down, man? I don't need nobody playing me cheap, man. Hey. Hey. You're wrong. You know that, don't you? You didn't quite listen to what she had to tell you. She said what's inside is much more important than what's... outside. Man, I done messed up. You see, your first mistake was to take that drink from Crumley here because all he gives out is crap, you know that. Hey. Can I get you something else? No, I got to get out of here, man. See you tomorrow. - Hey, Ellis. - Take my advice-- you-you-you-- Ellis: Hey, Miss Jean... it would kill me if anything ever happened to you. Jean: You just be there. I will. You don't have to ask me twice. [laughs] - Would I cheat you? - [chuckles] Would I short-change you? No, I wouldn't. Okay, you take care. I'll catch up with you. Where you been? I ain't seen you for two weeks now. Let me apologize to you, Jean. I had no right to say what I said to you. I'm sorry. You didn't go back to that Stanley fella, did you? No. It's all right, Mr. Ellis. It's over. I hold no grudges, have no hard feelings. We made a mistake. Stop calling me Mr. Ellis, and I didn't make a mistake. I love you, Jean. And a man can change. At least you could give me a chance. God, I missed you so much. Me too. I guess that's why I came here today. And to... get some of these porgies. Porgies? - How many you want? - How many can you eat? [laughing] [upbeat music playing] [telephone ringing] Hello? Hello? Oh, hey, baby. Oh, just sending Ellis and Jean off on their honeymoon. Huh? Oh, yeah, well, Buster won't be here till 9:00. Yeah, I'll be home. He what? Put that boy on the phone. Leroy! Are you simple? Getting suspended from school? You better have a good explanation when I get home, you understand me? Do you understand me? All right. Put your mama on the phone. - I don't even want to talk to you. - Hey, Reub! - How about a gin down here? - All right, all right. Yeah, hey, baby. Just let him think about that for a couple hours. Later! [smooches] [rap music playing] Hey, turn that music down, boy! Frieda, I'm home. I'm back here, sweetie. Where's my baby? Hi. Hey, you. Give me some! Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm! Both: Mwah! - You all right? - Yeah. - So how'd it go? - Not too bad. You want some juice or coffee? - I'll take some coffee. - Okay. Not too much happened today, you know. - I heard that the boy named Champ... - Mm-hmm. ...found himself a new manager. - Italian dude by the name of Ricco. - Oh, yeah? So, how's Mr. I-Got-Suspended- From-School-Today doing? Well, he said he was in the boys' bathroom, and some of the other guys were smoking. - Uh-huh? - He claims he wasn't, but the principal suspended all of them. So now he can't get back into school until his father has a sit-down with the principal. It never stops, huh? It's just that crowd he's hanging around with, Reuben. A couple of those boys that come over here to listen to that hip-hop, look like they just got out of jail. - [groans] - And that Tim-Tim or Tom-Tom-- whatever they call him-- lives around the corner on 28th Street. He got a mouth like a garbage can. Yesterday, I had to tell that boy to take his hat off and stop cussing or get the hell out of my house. [clicks tongue] Then he just rolled his eyes at me. - [microwave beeping] - I wanted to slap his face off. You know, you're going to have to talk to your son, Reuben. How come he's my son when he acts up? Because he is your son when he acts up. [banging on door] Take it easy, I'm coming! [sobbing] Help me, Reuben! Oh, God, he beat me up. He beat me up, Reuben. Oh, my God! What did he do to you? - Oh, God. - What happened? - Get back upstairs, mister. - What'd Uncle Willy do to her? - None of your business. - Let him stay and see how these men treat women. He don't need to see this, Frieda. Go in the kitchen and get your aunt a towel, please. What happened? What happened? He was drunk, and he just started beating on me because I burned the sausage. I just went to check on Keisha. I just went to check on Keisha. - Where are the children? - Yeah. - My God. - Where are the children? I don't know. Oh, my God, I don't know. I don't know! Reuben, you got to go get them. Go get my kids, please. Where-- where are they? They were on the steps. - I just ran. - Come on, let's go. - Come on, boy. - Oh, God, I just ran. - Frieda, I just ran. - It's okay. It's going to be all right. It's going to be all right, baby. I'll take the Avenue. You cover 28th Street. Lamar! Keisha! Hey, babies. How you doing? Oh, yeah! You all right, son? Come on, let me see you. You got hurt, huh? - Mnh-mnh. - Turn around. Let me see. Let me see. You didn't get hurt or anything? How about you? Are you all right, huh, huh? [laughs] Give me a hug, come on! It's so good to see you babies! I'm glad you're all right. Hey, Leroy! I found them. - Got 'em? - Yeah. [chuckles] How's my boy? Hey, what you doing out here with no shoes on, man? Come on, get up here. - Hey, Leroy, thanks for your help. - Yeah. - [chuckles] - Come on. [mimics clopping] There we go. My baby girl. Come here. Good night, sweetie. When are you going to call the cops, Della? It would kill Willy if I did that to him, Reuben. Oh, he goes for weeks without drinking nothing. He'll do for the kids, bring me home some gifts and stuff. It's just, I don't know, all of a sudden, he just snaps. Della, I don't care how good he is. What if he kills you? Man, you got to do something. Get a restraining order. I'll kick his butt. Hey, you know, you're two steps away from being grounded. - This is none of your business. - He ain't got no business hitting on my aunt! Look, you get upstairs before I jump on you. Why don't you go jump on Uncle Willy? He's the one going around beating up on people. - Hey! - You act like you're scared of him! Reuben. I'm going to let Della stay overnight here with the kids. - Okay? - Yeah. Thanks, Reuben. Reuben, I'm going to try to get Willy to get some counseling. I promise. What's this business at school about? I got suspended for nothing. I'm not dumb enough to smoke. I was just in there with Tom-Tom and Jooney. I wasn't doing nothing. Give me that pillow. And look, that's not the issue. If you're smart enough not to smoke, you got to be smart enough not to be in the room with people who do smoke. They're my homies, Daddy. We hang together. We go down together. Hey, you remember what I said about if I put my head in the toilet, would you do the same? - But they're my friends. - Can't you say no to your friends? Hmm? - Yeah. - All right. Now, I'm going to go down there and get you back in that school. But if I have to-- listen to me-- if I have to go back in that school one more time, it's going to be me and you. You understand? - Okay. - All right. Hey, what you going to do about Uncle Willy? I don't know, Leroy. I just don't know. You going to talk to Willy? [exhales sharply] I don't think so. I mean, if Della's not willing to do anything about it, why should I? She's scared, Reuben. Frieda, six months I've been asking her to do something about that. Six months. I told her before. I said, "Get some help." Think she'd do something about it? No! No, she claimed he was angry because he got laid off and she should be more understanding. Now, what do you want me to do about it? Go over there and fight him? You think I'm going to have a knock-down-drag-out on the street? I see enough of that at the bar. We're always fighting one another. I'm sick of it, baby. She's my sister, Reuben. And I'm not just going to let Willy kill her. All right, all right. No! I'll go over there myself. I already know how you feel, and I'm not blaming you, but somebody's got to do something before he winds up killing her. Now, you know, I'm not going to let you go over there by yourself. Come on. All right, all right! I'll talk to him! I will talk to him. Okay. I will talk to him. - Okay. - But not tonight. - Come here. - [chuckles] Come here! Yeah, that's better. You are so wonderful. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. And I swear to you that... it's the last time. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. You think you're getting over, huh? I didn't say I was getting over. We'll see how "last time" is. Last time, huh? - What are you doing? - Come over here! [laughs] Reuben! - [grunting] - Reuben, stop! We-- Reuben! Reuben, we've got company in the house. - Aw, damn. - Get off me. - Reuben! - Aww... man. Damn! That's a reason to beat up on Willy. Yo, I figure we could do it tonight, homie. My uncle always gets his booze from Vasquez, then goes home and beats up on my aunt. Man, if that was my aunt, I'd have popped that chump the first time he laid his hands on her. What's wrong with your father, kid? My pop's a punk, man, you know what I'm saying? He let my uncle beat all up on my aunt and won't do nothing about it. That's why I want us to do it. Catch that son of a bitch and kick his ass. Don't nobody mess with my family. That's right. - [glass shatters] - Shoot. Look at that. He probably stole something. Check it, though. I got to bounce, homie. But I'm with you, a'ight? - See you tonight. - Yeah. Reub! Reub! What's up? What's up? What's going on, dawg? I just lifted this from Macy's this morning. This, all you have to do is set this on the bar, you know, like, how you make them drinks, them piña coladas and the margaritas and things. Now, this piece here is battery-operated. You don't plug it in, don't need no wires, nothing. I'll give it to you real cheap-- $20. Bunchie, you know I don't buy hot stuff. Get that thing off the bar. $20. How's a man like me supposed to make a living? You want me on welfare? Living off your tax dollars, supporting me? Bunchie, the answer is no. Now hit the road. How about you buy me a drink? Reub, Reub. My shit's going down the drain out there, man. Bunchie, that ain't my problem. Hey. How about these Tiffany salt-and-pepper shakers, man? I got these from Macy's, too, man. This exquisite item-- Frieda will love it-- $6.50. - No. - $5. - No. - This is the real thing! Macy's! - No. - [sobbing] Reuben! Reuben, you got to stop him for me! You got to stop him, please! - Sit down. - Oh, God. What did he do now, huh? Hey, Bunchie, get that rag off the bar for me. - You going to give me that drink? - Get the rag, damn it! Come on! Shh, shh, shh... Tell me what happened, baby. What happened? He was mad about me coming over to your place last night. He started as soon as he came through the door. He hit Lamar, and he threw Keisha down. He threw Keisha down. Hey, Bunchie. Get out of the bar now. I said get out the bar! I can't go out there in the street, Reub. There's dudes looking for me. Now! - I said now! - A'ight, a'ight. I wouldn't drink that beer even if it was free! The worst beer I ever tasted! It tastes like piss! Now, look, look, look. Listen to me. We're going down there and get them children, huh? But this is the last time. If you don't have sense enough to put that man in jail, I'm not going to help you no more. You understand me, huh? - All right. - Okay. Just get my kids. Please, Reuben, get my kids. - Please. - Come on, come on, let's go. I'm going to go pick up the children and bring them back here, and I still got to go to work. - Reuben? - Hmm? You're not planning on getting into a fight, are you? No, no, I'm just going to talk to him, that's all. And when Leroy gets in, you keep him in here. - Okay. - All right. [sighs] Hey, Willy, open up. Willy! [rap music blaring] What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Answer me! You wasn't going to do nothing, so I figured me and my squad would kick Uncle Willy's ass. You better get on back home before I break your neck right here in the street. This is none of your business. Or yours. What? - I said, "Or yours." - You ain't my father! Well, I am your father today! Now, get out of here. You hear me? Get on. Hey, Leroy. You better be home when I get there, too. You hear me? [rap music continues] Come on, Willy. Open the door. Willy! What you want, huh? Look, Willy, I just came to pick up the kids and take them to their mama. You got to keep your hands to yourself. To hell with you. Come around here all holy moly. You ain't taking my kids nowhere! And she's my wife, and you and no-damn-body else going to tell me how to run my family. Now, you just get your ass off my steps before I kick your black ass. Hey, hey, hey, Willy. Look, I just came around here to talk to you. There's no reason why we can't talk peacefully. You can't beat up on Della like that. You cannot. What you know about it, hmm? I work two shifts, and I come home. That bitch be sitting up watching TV. The house is dirty. The kids, they smell like shit, and there's no food in the house. - Willy. - What you know about it? Willy, look, that ain't none of my business, but hitting up on Della-- hitting her-- that is. Now, the next time you hit her or you abuse them children, - I'm going to have you arrested. - Oh, yeah? - Daddy! - Get off of my porch! Get off of my porch! No, homie. Let's see how bad your pop really is. Ain't nobody going to get in my business! Not my business! Willy, can't we talk about this? Do we have to do this out here in the street? Oh, we ain't talking about nothing! Willy, come on! Damn. Stop. Willy, don't do this. Now, be careful with that. Come on, Willy! Stop! Come on. Come on now! Damn! Damn! Did you see that? Your papa is bad, homie! [Willy coughing] Keisha! Lamar! Come on out here. Yeah, but he don't like all that fighting in the street mess, and neither do I. I'm going home, man. So what you mean? You ain't going to hang? - [sighs] - Boy: Check it out! It's a fight. - [Willy groaning] - Come on, kids. Come on. Where's he taking her? Are you coming, Lamar? Boy: Is the dad okay? I know. There she is. - You okay? - Mama? Where's Lamar? Where's Lamar? He decided to stay with his father. What? - I don't believe that! - Why? Well, he just did. That's it! - Damn. - Come here. You got in a fight, didn't you? Yeah. Come here, sweetie. Della... call the cops the next time. Take him to court. I don't care what you do, but you have to stop him. Nobody else can. And until you do something, we can't help you. It's the last time. Now, come on in the kitchen and get this child something to eat. There's some lasagna in the refrigerator. What is that, Frieda? You're my sister. You're just going to leave me out here in the cold? I cannot help it if he beats on me! What can I do? What can I do? Della, please. Here. I'm glad you told her. You're the only one who could. I know. - And I'm sorry you had to fight him. - Nah. Ah... sometimes it can't be avoided, you know? [chuckles] [grunts] Hey, uh... is Leroy up there? He's upstairs. Yeah. Where the hell else am I supposed to go? You're all the family me and the kids got! Family's supposed to look out for each other! What if he stabs me? I can't take this. - [door opens] - Leroy? I saw you on the corner, and I told you to go home. Can't I worry about you? Yeah, that's beside the point now. I told you to go home, and you chose to listen to your friends, didn't you? - Hmm? - Yeah. All right, now, you're grounded for two weeks. No outgoing phone calls, no TV. - Aw, come on, Dad. - No, this is a lesson, Leroy. Remember? If I choose to put my head in the toilet, that don't mean you have to put your head in there with me. I was just watching to make sure nothing happened to you. I don't need your protection, Leroy. I've been living on this Avenue for all my life. Fighting, knocking people upside the head, and I am sick of it! I sure don't want you to grow up in it. Leroy... Look, son. Violence is the last choice-- the last choice. And ain't nobody going to be a hero for taking it, you understand me? You understand? - Yeah. - All right. Now I got to go back to work. You take care of your mama and do what you can for your aunt, okay? Okay. I love you, son. I love you, too. [sighs] - Hey. - Hey. Uh... is she sleeping here again tonight? She's my sister, Reuben. - Mwah! - [chuckles] Mm! Damn that Willy. See you later. - You be careful, okay? - Mm-hmm. And I'm... I'm sorry about all of this. She's one of us. [chuckles] [sighs] Thank you. You sure gave me the right one. [upbeat music playing]
