- Good morning, naked mole rats! Yeah! - Are you ready to rock the tunnel? - Yeah! - Can you dig it? Yeah! - Because that's what Grand-Mah did. She dug this tunnel with her bare teeth to make us a rockin' underground home! And that's why we're here to rock the Morning Song! Um. And... and? Mole rats! - I'm going out tonight, and I don't have a thing to wear. - Isn't it great? - Yeah! - Living in your skin? Let me be your advisor. No matter where you've been, you'll need some moisturizer. - Yeah! - That's the way you got to roll when you're... - Naked mole facts. - Mole facts! - Okay, I've got three questions for y'all. Anybody in this tunnel a little bit mole? Yeah! - Anybody in this tunnel a little bit rat? Yeah! - Anybody in this tunnel all naked? Yeah! - Let's give 'em the skinny. - Thank you, every-mole. Have a rockin', very naked day in the tunnels, and we'll see you tonight for the Evening Song! - You know what I love about this place? No shirt, no shoes... Service! - Exactly. Catch you at the Evening Song tonight? - Oh, for sure. I love underground music. - Dude, we are just like this tunnel. Am I right, Tall? - How so, Venti? - We are made of rock. - Yeah. - Whoa, yeah! - Oh, yeah. - Hold up. Didn't you guys notice something missing during the Morning Song? - Yeah. Our clothes! Dude. - Whoa, yeah! - Oh, yeah. - I'm talking about Wilbur J. Molerat. - Oh, yeah. Weird, huh? - Wilbur's never missed the Morning Song. - No mole has. He's our band buddy, but I hope Grand-Mah doesn't find out. For our sake. - Dudes, I'll bet no mole noticed. - News flash, every mole noticed that The Moleing Stones band was missing something Wilbur J. Mole Rat, Jr. Gah! - My name is Stark Naked because I'm stark naked. You'll just have to trust me on that. Questions. Where was Wilbur? What would Grand-Mah say? And what is the band doing about it? Ahh! - We got to find Wilbur. - And now, Les Pants with the weather. Take it away, Les. - Today's weather is gonna be... exactly the same as every other day, Stark. Our colony's located inside a tunnel, so it's not like anything's gonna fall out of the sky. Indeed. - I don't even know why this job exists. - No one does. And that's the naked truth. Thanks for watching DNN, the "Definitely Naked Network." This is DNN. - I wish the weather could change. I wish there was more to being a mole rat than just rocking. I mean, I get it. The tunnel is rock, so we're supposed to rock. But sometimes it's hard rock, and I, Wilbur J. Molerat, Jr., think that there must be more to the fabric of life. Like every-mole being 100% naked 500% of the time. It's boring and chilly. Ooh. Sure, the Weather Mole says nothing falls out of the sky when you live in a tunnel, but imagine if it could! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah! Whoa. Whoa! Huh? Ah! What is that? Oh, wow! Oh! Eek! A shirt! Here in the dirt. Oh, yeah! Why not find out? Whoa. Oh! Ooh! - Look. - Whoa! - Wilbur? Hey, Wilbur? Wilbur, dude, where are you? - Come on out, Wilbur. We're looking for you. - Ah! - He's not here. - Or here. - He's not in Grand-Mahs-R-Us either. But check out these cool Grand-Mah pillows I bought. - Sweet. I got these balloons. - Um, how about a little less shopping, and a little more looking for Wilbur? - Oh, yeah. Wilbur? Hey, Wilbur? - Shopping later? - Ugh! Come on. - Wilbur? - Dude! - Wilbur? - Wilbur? I don't get it. He's got to be around here somewhere. - Ah! - Dude. - What? Is there something in my teeth? - We didn't just see what we just saw, did we? - Dude, no way. - Hmm. How's it looking? - Oh, yeah, you're good. - Thanks, Wilbur. Boy, ever since I got these braces, everything gets stuck in my... ahh! - I'm getting dressed. Hubba-wha? - What? Did you say sandals? - What about plaid? - Blegh! - How 'bout stockings? Ugh! - Thanks. - Ah! - Drummers look great in tassels. Eek! - So you don't think it's a good idea then? - Is he wearing clothes? - I'm out of here. - Okay, I get it. This isn't a great look for the band, but I like a simple business casual ensemble. - Is "business casual" an oxymoron? - Eh. - Doesn't matter. Wilbur, you're a rocking naked mole rat. Why under-earth would you ever, ever, ever, ever want to do... that? - It's just, um, I guess I found out that I discovered that there's more to life than living under a rock, or even rockin' under a rock. - Hubba-wha? - Wearing clothes... Well, I mean... It's really fun. - Ah! - For me. - Oh, sure. Sure, sure. That's great. I mean, if you like clothes so much, why don't you just open a clothing store or something? - Dude. - A store? - Do you really think Wilbur should open a store? - No. I was being sarcastic. You moles wouldn't know sarcasm if it bit you on the tail. - Sarcasm can bite you on the tail? - Of course it can't. I was being sarcastically sarcastic about sarcasm! - Oh. - Oh... don't get it. - A clothing store. - Wilbur! Look, we've been friends forever. The band needs you to stop playing dress-up and start playing music for tonight's Evening Song. - Dude. - Yeah. - Well, what should I wear? - Your birthday suit! - Duh. - Now come on, we're heading back to the arena. - Suit. Ugh. - A mole rat with clothes? I've never seen such a thing in all my days. - Hey, Wilbur, we should get going. - Oh, I'm going... to open a store. Ooh! Right here in Tunnel Square. A store with hats and all kinds of clothes! A place where every-mole can come and try wearing whatever they feel like. And I'll call it "Hats... And More." "Hats and More!" Oh-oh! Imagine. Naked mole rats won't be able to resist once they hear my catchy jingle. La la la la la la la... - It's the only fashion in the colony! - Whoo! Watch this. Whee! Hats... and More! Whoo! Ha! Ha! Whoa! - Take a peek. - Lose that frown. - We'll dress you chic. - Innovative. - And creative. - Decorated. - Sophisticated. - Highly rated. - Parking validated. - Who could hate it? Yay, me! Hmm. If only my new store had some clothes. Hooray! Now every-mole will love my Hats and More store. And once they try on this or this or this, they'll be happier. Mm. I am. I can't think of a single solitary, itty, bitty, little thing that can possibly go wrong with this plan. A clothing store? - Ooh, look, a potential customer. Welcome! - A mole rat wearing c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-clothes? - You're very good at running. It looks like you could use some sneakers. What do you think? They scream, "Fun!" But whisper, "Sophisticated." - I'm telling everyone! - What a nice mole, spreading the news about my store like that. - Ah! - A one, a two, a... - Ah! - What was that? - News flash. Clothes are reportedly falling from the sky. - Questions! Is this real or just fake nudes? And more importantly, who is to blame? Answers! Tails are pointing at a certain non-naked naked mole rat who has opened a clothing store in the town square. Opinion! If that mole rat has any friends or true band mates... Ah! - They'd better set him straight before the colony gets completely dressed out... I mean, stressed out. Ah! - Dude, we got to stop Wilbur. - But we already tried telling him not to wear clothes. - And we took him to the Moleseum. - Maybe something a little more grand might knock his socks off. For good. - I hope Venti, Tall, and Grande stop by. They have no idea what's in store for them. But I do. Clothes! - There he is. Wilbur! - Hello. - What under-earth do you think you're doing? - I'm having a sale. - Ooh. I do love a sale. - Sale is over, Wilbur J. Molerat. - Ah! - Sorry. - Come with us. - Oh. Are you looking for an in-home clothing consultation? Because I think something flouncy would really take the edge off of the "business in the front, business in the back" attitude you're rocking. - Enough! - Ah! - Sorry. - Tall? - On it. - Whoa! - It is time to restore your tunnel vision. - It is? - Wow. Look at that. - He sure looks like he's in trouble. - Is that mole rat wearing clothes? - W-where are we going? - We're going to get you help, Wilbur. - Help? - Help. - Quiet. We're here. Help. - Wilbur, look at this monument of Grand-Mah. Grand-Mah. - Oh, yeah, Grand-Mah. - No. Grand-Mah. Grand-Mah. - Grand-Mah. - Wilbur. Let the grand nakedness of Grand-Mah's statue remind you of how she carved this entire tunnel with her teeth. - Or of how she created our colony with her bare... And I mean bare... hands. - Or of other cool stuff she does and has done that I'm pretty sure we all know about, so, uh... dude. - I want you to gaze upon that and ask yourself what Grand-Mah would do if she saw you. - You want me to put myself in her shoes? - No! We want you to put yourself in her bare, fleshy feet. I mean, just look at her in big statue form. - You know what, Grande? You're right. Grand-Mah does look great. - Dude. - Grand-Mah does look regal. - Yes! - Grand-Mah does look magnificent! - That's my bandmate. - But she'd look even better in a casual shirt and some summer slacks. Argh! - After a certain age, slacks flatter. Wilbur! Naked mole rats don't wear clothes! - Owwie. You hurt my... feelings. - Freeze! - Aw, and now my pants are all dirty. - Ah! - Ah! - Ahh! - Ahh! - Pssht! Goose Flesh, this is Long Tooth. We've got a dresser. Belly button not visible. I need backup! - Hoo! - Ha! - Ha! - Tails where we can see 'em! - Sweet epidermis! He's wearing c-c-c-c-c-c... - Get ahold of yourself, rookie. - I don't believe this. I am just wearing clothes! - What's that? What's going on? - Now you've done it. - Done what? - You got Big Tail's attention. - B-B-Big Tail? Who's that? - That's a codename. - For Grand-Mah. Now stand back as I expound upon the glory of her authority, profundity, and nudity. - Wow. That is one intense mole. - Dude. - I don't feel so good about this. - This is not what I was expecting. - What's gonna happen to us? - What's gonna happen to me? You might want to kneel. - Kneeling. - Kneeling. - Kneeling. - Kneeling! - Maybe bringing Wilbur here wasn't such a good idea. - Dude, it wasn't my idea. Ooh... What's with all the racket? I can barely hear myself being naked. - Uh, um. Oh! Great Grand-Mah. - Great Grand-Mah? My mommy's here? - Uh, no. - "Great" as in "very impressive." - Oh. Huh? - We come before you today to present something so terribly g-g-guh-guh that it will make your skin go all n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nuh! - Sounds serious. What's the problem? Him! - Um, your Grand-Mah-ness-ness... ness. - At ease. What's the problem with him? - Grand-Mah... - Wilbur is... - Wearing clothes. - Oh, is that the... Hubba-wha? Wilbur, is this true? Are you wearing something? - It's business casual, ma'am. - Business casual's an oxymoron. - Knew it. Either you're working or you're hanging out. - Seriously. You can't do both. Anyway, why are you wearing clothes, Wilbur? - Yeah, why? - Why? - Why? - Why? Why? - Dude. - Well, um, you see, I thought... why not? - Why not? Why not? Did you just say to me, to my face, the face of the greatest great, as in very impressive, Grand-Mah, most stupendously, fantastic naked mole rat in the history of naked mole rats, which, by the way, includes some very impressive individuals, all of whom were as naked as the day they were born until the day they died, did you just say "Why not?" - Yes. - That's it! I am going to make a very big decision, so gather the entire colony. The entire colony? The entire colony? - The entire colony? - Is there an echo in this tunnel? Gather the entire colony so that I can announce a... A thing you say, that is really, really important, in a very dramatic way in public. - A tweet? - A proclamation! Wilbur, go to your room while I decide what to do about you and your new ideas. - Gulp. - This proclamation is gonna be a really, really, really big deal. A really, really, really big deal? - Seriously. The echo thing is killing me. - Grand-Mah? - Yes? - Before you go, I have something for you. - What is that? - A thinking cap to help you think. It's fun, right? Ooh, I think she really likes the hat I gave her. - Oh, Wilbur, you're doomed. - Grand-Mah made the announcement and soon will make a pronouncement. - Grand-Mah's made the announcement, and soon she'll make a pronouncement! - Mm. - Come on. - This just in. Socks! That's right. The sky is falling with fashion. They're having reports of jackets, skirts, shorts, and even white pants. And it's after Labor Day! - Question. How is this happening? Answer. Who knows? Question. Who can we blame? Answer. Wilbur J. Molerat! Ah! What do I do? Oh. - Wilbur? - Is it time already? - Uh-huh. - We don't think Grand-Mah's proclamation is gonna be good for you, Wilbur. The colony just isn't ready for all of... uh, this. - But this is me. We were afraid you might say that. - So we got you this. - Aww. It matches my outfit. - Ugh, Mole, that's not why we got you luggage. Look. We're your friends, so we got your back, even with a shirt on it. - But what if Grand-Mah isn't "fashion forward"? - Dude. - Wilbur, if you won't go to the proclamation without clothes, then just go. Go somewhere overground where you can do... Where you can, you know... Be you. - Wilbur, do the right thing. - But... I miss Wilbur already. - Me too. - There was nothing else I could do for Wilbur. Nothing else we could do. - Really? - Look, if he'd been smart, Wilbur would've just stayed naked. There's no way Grand-Mah's proclamation was gonna go well for him. I guess we don't have to worry about that since Wilbur's leaving. - Yeah. Every mole rat in the colony's gonna show up for Grand-Mah's big proclamation about him, and he won't even be there. Dude, Grand-Mah's gonna be mad. Yeah. At us. - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah? - Grand-Mah! - Grand-Mah, there's something we need to tell you about... Wilbur? Hello. - You're here. Dude, you've got to... wait, you're not wearing a shirt. - And you're not wearing pants. - And you're not wearing... Ah! What are those? - Socks. I tried to be like every mole, but then I got cold feet. - Wilbur, you've got to get out of here. The crowd is starting to murmur. - Murmur, murmur. - Murmur, murmur, murmur. - She's right. - You know what? Let 'em. I, Wilbur "Jumpsuit" Mole-Rat Jr., am just as mole rat as you or Venti or Tall or any mole, so I get to stay right here and listen to Grand-Mah's proclamation just like any mole in argyle socks. - Dude. That... Is so beautiful. Wilbur! Ah! - Socks are clothes! Wearing them at Grand-Mah's big proclamation... That's like if I was wearing a, I don't know, an elegant pantsuit... With a matching fancy hat... Creating a fashionable ensemble that was both amazing and age appropriate! Um, thanks for the support, but that reaction's over the top, don't you think? - Not that. That! Ah! - I don't believe it! - Dude! - That's what I was gonna say. Is that an elegant pantsuit Grand-Mah's wearing? - I don't know what to think about that amazing and age-appropriate attire. - I'm so confused! - My fellow naked mole rats, I have never worn clothes until I heard Wilbur J. Mole Rat Jr.'s simple question. "Why not?" Why not, indeed? Wilbur, do clothes hurt anyone? - No. - Are they fun? - They are for me. Exactly! Clothes can be fun. And while they may not be for every-mole, this old naked mole rat wishes she had tried getting dressed earlier! Us too. - What is that? What is that? - Don't get your tails in a knot. These clothes falling from the sky for some insufficiently explained reason, they're not a crisis. They are an opportunity! - Okay. - So here's my officially official proclamation. Feeling fancy? Try some pants-y. Want to make a racket? How 'bout a jacket? Still can't take it? No problem. Stay naked. All you really have to do is ask, "Why not?" - Why not? - Why not? - That's the thought. Ask yourself, "Why not?" Why not? Why not? - If it hurts someone... - Don't do it. - If it's fun... - Get to it. - So when you're on the spot, just ask yourself, "Why not?" - If it's fun, then get to it. - Can I try a "Why not?" - Well, let's hear it, young mole. - What if I did this? - That was neither rock nor roll. - That wasn't even "easy listening." - "Easy listening" is another oxymoron. Like "smart phone." Uh-huh. - Never really thought about it that way. - Okay. Okay, okay. But it didn't hurt anyone, did it? - Um, nope. Nope. - I guess not. - So that means... - Don't do it. - If it's fun... Get to it! - Why not? Whew. - Eh, I never thought that statue captured my essence anyway. - Phew. - Not like this proclamation ensemble, huh? You know it. Whoa! Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - Seriously. You would totally rock the runway in a mole rat fashion show. - A mole rat fashion show? A mole rat fashion show? Ugh... Why... not? - You're getting it. Mole rats, let's rock our pants on for the Evening Song! - Do these pants make my tail look big? - Eh. - Good evening, naked and not-so-naked mole rats! Are you ready to rock the tunnel? Yeah! - Can you dig it? Whoo! - You bet you can. Ha-ha. Hit it, Wilbur! - A-one! A-two! A-one, two, three! Ugh! - Shake it, Grand-Mah, but don't break it! - I'm okay! Whee! - Dude, if you told me yesterday that the fashion show would rock, I would've said, dude. But now that I'm in one, I'm like, dude! - I know. We're ready, Wilbur. - Then let's rock it. Whoo-hoo, that tickles! - This is Stark Naked reporting for PNN, the "Possibly Naked Network." News flash. I'm wearing pants! You'll just have to trust me on that. - Wilbur, is it possible for me to stay naked and still be in your fashion show? - Grande, I have two words for you. Why not? - Yay! - Ha-ha! Look at me. I'm wearing a birthday suit designed by my biological genes. - I can still see your belly button! - Come on, everybody. I'm talking to you out there. Get off your tails and show off your fashion moves! You're part of our fashion show too. - Yeah! - So let me get this straight. You were driving a delivery truck full of doll clothes for fun when, out of nowhere, you saw a duckling with a hot dog crossing the road. So you swerved to avoid it, which made you crash into this particular ditch and spilled an entire load of teeny, tiny clothes into that hole over there? - Happens to my cousin Herb all the time. - I'm gonna need to see your license. - About that... Hey, is that a police car? Whoo-hoo! - Not again. No! Come back here! Mole rats! - Yeow! Rock 'n' roll! - Yeah-ho! Whoo-hoo!
