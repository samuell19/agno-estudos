Digitally remastered with the support of THE LAST NABOBS In 1858, Mór Jókai began the epilogue to his novel with these words: "In Hungary, till the middle of this century, wealth, culture and the nation's strength were represented by the nobility. This is one fact. And the Hungarian nation was in those times poorer, less cultured, and weaker than almost any other nation in Europe. This is another fact." Come, my lambkins! Turn around! Pick them up! Slowly... slowly... Wine! Food! Music! Your Honour may find my wine too sour, but my wife is roasting some pork. Then my kitchen is richer than yours. Hey, you! My boots! And me? Come, come... What's the matter? - We're stuck! - A pothole. Where are we? In the puszta Herr Baron. Puszta... puszta... I can see that for myself! Is there a village near here? There's a house. Come here then! Make a back! I'll stay here. Let's go! A room and supper, at once! The food's run out, the room's occupied. I'll share it. - I wonder. - Is it a gentleman or a lady? A man can't deny it from me, a lady should be pleased. But meanwhile some wine! Try it, sir. Here you are. Thank you. Stop! To the wall! Are you modest or aren't you? All of you, about turn! Off with it! Don't mind me, Mademoiselle. Excuse the intrusion. It's this horrible weather... Allow me, please, Baron Abellino Kárpáthy. Baron Kárpáthy, you say? Do you know what you're saying? My name, sir. Are you quite sure you're Baron Kárpáthy? Here is my card. I can tell by your dress you've come from abroad. Yes, from Paris. You see, I heard that my uncle, the master of enormous estates and fine manors, a true Hungarian nabob, had passed away. So you've come for the funeral. For my inheritance rather. But may I have the pleasure of knowing your name? It won't be a pleasure. Because your late uncle, the rich testator, is me! János Kárpáthy. Here is my card. I'm still going strong. The news was false. I'm alive. And how! But now that you're here, welcome! Wasn't your name Béla once? Never mind. Food, music for my dear nephew! Who's even lost his honourable Hungarian name! This'll last for two days. Or three... Wonderful shot. But I win, my hat's in place! 1000 francs, dear uncle, that was the bet. I don't deal in francs. I'll pay you in good florins. Since I had the luck to find a live uncle, - let us come to terms. - What's on your mind? Pay my Paris debts. A trifle. And I won't bother you. I won't let a single florin go abroad. I'd rather spend my money on follies at home. Stay with me... You'd live like a lord. Magnificent, dear uncle! I'm tempted to stay, but pay my debts. A mere 300 thousand francs. Not as a present, as an advance. On what? On my legacy. Your fortune will be mine when you're in the coffin. The coffin? You won't beget an heir anyway. Out, everybody! Go home! Do you want a new inn? - Who wouldn't? - What's your price? 10 thousand florins. Tomorrow I'll pay you in gold. Bring torches! Don't spare anything! I'll make you pay for this! Barbarous beast! What a country! Your bills fall due tomorrow, sir. We'll prolong them. For what? To gain time, Mr. Griffard. - Till my uncle... - He's in the best of health. I've been making inquiries. Who'll lend you 300 thousand francs? You, Mr. Griffard. To prevent me from blowing out my brains. I see... You have to prolong my bills and grant me credits, otherwise you'll never get the money. You'll have a half of million. Kindly sign a note of hand for 800 thousand... What? Are you sure it's all right? You are an usurer! Language! I must have my risk secured. What risk? The old man will soon kick the bucket. - Are you sure you'll be his heir? - What do you mean? He could marry... You could get killed in a duel, fall from a horse, break your neck... Charming! Only normal precautions. Immortals can also die. Like that wretched Napoleon did last year! Afterall, we're just humans. Gentlemen! It seems our Parisians are in revolt! Where are you going? Ask him rather where he's been. With my banker! You're my guests! Burlington... Who is that woman? Why, it's Chataquela. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. He spent three nights in Chataquela's garden in the rain. - What's the matter? - Don't you know? The dog. The other attraction at the Golden Parrot, besides Chataquela. But who is she? I only arrived in Paris yesterday... An exotic dancer. My uncle knew her family in Afghanistan. She eloped with a European. As for the dog... It was a sheep-dog. It could sing. Abellino bought it for 10 thousand francs as it was Chataquela's rival in the cabaret. Then, he obligingly shot the expensive beast, in front of her. - And she? - She just said: A pity. I love dogs. And left. Her next victim. Mad with love. But he won't have any better luck with her. Come now! Only her husband can kiss her. But she's had a dozen husbands in Paris. In her country they contract marriage by exchanging belts. If one party returns the belt, that means divorce. Glorious! It's midnight. Ladies and gentlemen! Now comes the climax of the evening. I'll only say her name. The Daughter of Fire! Chataquela! The Daughter of Fire. Did you get signed, Rudolf? The Daughter of Fire... It's no joke. No, because in her country widows burn themselves at the stake. This woman would leave her husband for Rudolf. He's young, rich, and a count. This woman could die for the man she loves. Nonsense... - Let's bet on it. - What do you bet? I'll make her acquaintance. I'll marry her, then I'll shoot myself. If she doesn't kill herself, I've lost. - But if she does... - But if she does? Then you've lost. And you have to shoot yourself too. - Well, gentlemen? - This is madness! Any takers? I'm surely not your man. Then I'll ask you never to mention the lady in my presence. Fantastic! These Hungarians! If he had shot himself, how very amusing. Don't you agree? The bank. You here? So late? Whenever I can find you. Find me? Were you looking for me? Yes... First without coming near you. In my thoughts only. Last night I stood in front of your gate. Waiting. I didn't go home. Here I can work undisturbed. Why were you looking for me? Need you ask? - Fidelity... - I have a husband. In London. You gave him your silk belt. I loved him. You'll go to London and take it back. Yes. I'll go tomorrow. I'll be back in a week. Come to me. In a week. I'll come. Meeting someone? - Good day. - Good day. Yes, someone from London. Me too. - You know Count Eszéki? - No. He's touring Europe with his family. We'll meet here and travel home together. Home? I know, life will be hard back home. It will, after Europe. Elegance, glamour... You're mistaken. You're squandaering your money and leading an empty life. Life is empty and aimless. Aimless enough to be thrown away? I heard of your foolish bet. Seriously, I'm ashamed of you. Let it pass, please. You're bitter, unsmiling, cynical... - I pity you. - I'm begging you! It's the truth. Yours is a historical name. Do you value your life so little? I don't value it at all. What's this? Spleen? Shall I go home to play cards and drink? Show them there are other things to do! We're barbarians. What else is there in Hungary? What is Hungary? Home. If you stil remember this simple noun. Excuse me. I wasn't eavesdropping... You were arguing so hotly, I couldn't help noticing you were Hungarians. Are you Hungarian? I am Sándor Barna. Miklós Wesselényi. Szentirmay. What are you doing in Paris? I'm a cabinet maker. I've learnt the trade here, I've made some money. Now I'm going home. To someone, no doubt. Parents, a fiancee... No, sir. I have no one. Why the hurry then? I'm Hungarian, sir. I'm taking home what I acquired here. See? The noun in question... Farewell and good luck! The stagecoach from Calais is arriving. Sir! In case you ever need help, here's my card. Thank you, sir. Coming? I'll wait here. And over there, Abellino Kárpáthy and Baron Fegyverneky... Our aristocrats are absorbing French culture in Paris. Mostly in this place. Lunch in the Jockey Club, supper somewhere else... At night they meet here again. This is a most fashionable place. Are you here every night, Count Szentirmay? - With my friends. - Who are they? Impeccable gentlemen. Pleasure-seeking, but never undignified. Hungarian nobles, French marquises, English lords. Where's Burlington? Take Lord Burlington. A young diplomat. A future ambassador. Don't get me wrong... I know you're still young. Look, a Hungarian dance! She didn't arrive? No. She may have missed the coach... She said she'd be dancing here tonight. You're travelling with us? If you don't object, Flóra. You are in a hurry... Homesickness... Cattle bells... Sunset... Muddy rivers... A country of sheep... We've a house in Pest. Pest... A nest of petty Germans. And you know why? Because you're all abroad. In Europe. In Paris. Is this a reproof? I've no right to reprove you. You can live where you like. I just know that if the rich abandon a nation, that nation will be poor. Our next number. The bear and the hunter! Most amusing. The hunter'll sit on the bear and sing a song. Don't tell me. Spare me the triumphal song, I cannot sing a note. But who is he? Lord Burlington. The future ambassador? Young people are different nowadays. They are modern. They enjoy themselves, they shun deep, soul-stirring feelings. That's why we were so surprised at that tragic event in London. A young woman came to see her husband. He was a great poet. She found him dead. She killed herself too. In a horrible way. In a fire... She burned herself to death. She came from afar, from an Eastern country. What a barbarous custom. She's dead? She lived in Paris. Haven't you heard of her? A strange name. Chataquela. Are you ill? The air is stifling here. We are ready, sir. Don't take me for a fool, whatever I said yesterday... Hungary is calling me back. Quite unexpectedly. I wonder why. Welcome you both. Enjoy yourselves! I'll show you the Whitsun Wonders. But you worked the greatest wonder. - Wonder? - Bringing Rudolf home. He came of his own will. Thanks to you. This is nothing. Look! This is the real thing! This year, Whitsun coincides with the birthday of János Kárpáthy, our good lord. The wine is free! The food is free! You'll see wonders for a song! After the noonday bell, the best horsemen will be crowned King of Whitsun! What is the reward? Free wine at the inn for a year. The boys must respect him, the girls dance with him first. He'll be king till next Whitsun. A passing glory. There's no winner! Let the sticks decide. Go ahead, boys! They'll kill each other! Only one will kill the other. Sára! Here! Yours is the first dance! What'll you make of your kingship, Miska? I don't know yet. Free wine at the inn, the lads to serve me, the girls to spoil me. Not so bad. I'll bear it manfully. Then I'll be a horse-herd again. Listen, Miska! For a year, I'll make you a squire! As you like. But how should I behave to be taken for a gentleman? Be as great a scoundrel as you can. I'll give you money for drinks and cards. Then it's up to you. To me? I see, Your Honour. The hell "Your Honour"! János! Dear János! Yes, dear János. Stop! There's no winner! Let the wine decide! Come on! Stop! By Jove! Not bad! A noble dressed up as a horse-herd. An original idea. You're a game fellow. Don't rob me while we're embracing! Show them another trick. That's nothing! Are you jeering at me? I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you! Not so fast! Dear friends! We'll have guests from Paris, my nephew Abellino and his friends. Let's receive them in style. My nephew is coming to ask for my pardon. The two last Kárpáthys will be reconciled. I greet the master of the house in the name of his only relative. Baron Abellino Kárpáthy received his uncle's condoning message. Being ill, he couldn't come in person. So he's sending you his compliments, and his birthday present. That must be some present! You are a pair of vile assassins! BRATISLAVA, Hungary My deepest sympathy, dear friend. That poor uncle of mine! - God rest his soul. - Soon! Has he been laid out yet? The news may come any moment now. May he not suffer long. - Mr. Solicitor. - At your service! Write to my banker in Paris. My uncle is dying, I'll need money, at least 100 thousand francs. Dispatch a special messenger! I'll send the letter at once. That's settled. Now let's talk about women. How about Fanny Mayer? Has the fruit ripened? A beautiful piece. My father got it from Maria Theresa. Who gave you my address? I met your young partner. I know him from Paris. It's meant for an old friend who's been ill. A copper plate has come loose. - Good morning. - Good morning. - That's it? - Yes. In Bratislava there's only old George who can repair it. While Parliament's sitting, I'll repair it. My foster daughter. She's fond of singing. A pretty voice, they say. A beautiful voice. I must give it a close look. I'll fetch my lens. A nice girl. George took her recently into his house. We've interrupted the young lady. She's still a child. A pretty child. What a charming voice! Must I always have an escort? Mrs. Kram or you? You've other things to do, Sándor. It's a pleasure. I enjoy it. And George won't allow you to go out alone. I know. We should move from Bratislava. Yes? - Where to? - To Pest, or to a village. To a place... ...where you would be safe. Don't worry. I can take care of myself. Let's hide. It's Polly! I'm glad you escaped from your awful home. Who was she with? Some rich old gentleman, whom she loves. Certainly. Look! The youngest Mayer girl. She's coming into shape. Time to put her on the market. Her sisters know their trade. It's hopeless, she's well-guarded. Nothing is hopeless! What about her papa? When he found out about his daughters, he ran away. He drowned himself. I hope the widow won't close the house down. Close the Mayer house? Parliament would dissolve! Who cares? But that little girl... This big one isn't bad either. Her sister, little Fanny, she's a peach. Gentlemen, within a month Fanny will be mine! You want to marry a commoner? Not me. I just want some fun. Bratislava is just a village. Parliament is only for petty nobles, I'm bored. So I'll get hold of Fanny. I doubt it. Shall we bet? 100 ducats? All right. I'll even make it 200! What a voice! - Beautiful, isn't it? - Heavenly... Heart-rending is the word. May I ask: are you in mourning? In eternal mourning. My Intended... Oh, that voice! My beloved was a singer. Young and virginal. Such is life... Deep as the ocean. Who is that gentleman? He's mourning his Intended. He heard you sing. The very voice of my beloved one, he said. He listened to my singing? He would pay for your lessons. He's wealthy. When his beloved died, he swore to help a girl with great talent to become a real artist. What's he like? Maybe you'll meet him. I'll ask him. We won't renounce our privileges! We can't renounce our due from the serfs. We fought the king for 15 years to get Parliament convened. Our rights are at stake! But times are changing. I spit on change! Well, spit in there. Ah, Fanny. I've already won 10 ducats. She's come. Who could resist me? Can you see? That's him! Not him. That one! He's waving his hat. Not him? I thought it was... Let's go, Mrs. Kram. Fanny! What's the matter? Nothing, auntie. You're so silent. You're so crestfallen. Did you have a row? Who with? With Sándor. You think that me and Sándor... Fanny! You've got a secret. It's no secret. Only... Mrs. Kram... in the church... When did this infamy begin? Answer me! A month ago. You accepted the money? How could you? He looked so sincere... And you believed his stupid story? His helping an unknown girl unselfishly. His paying the organist and a teacher. How much money did you get? 320 florins, but it all went to the teachers. - Here are the receipts. - Mrs. Kram... You're a monster! Pack up Fanny's things, she's leaving. What's the name of this gentleman? A local carpenter, Mr. Boltay has donated 320 florins to the hospital. The sum was a gift from Baron Abellino Kárpáthy to the foster daughter of the donor, who deemed it more advisable to spend the sum on charity. This is no joke! I'm at your disposal. You want to stand in for Mr. Boltay? Your principal can't insist on duelling with an old man. I accept the challenge for him. Have you the courage? I fought at Waterloo. I was decorated. War is different. One can get lost in the mob. But to face a pistol alone... Did you come to scare me? Well, as you will. Can you fence? I can handle a pistol as well as a sword. All right. Who are your seconds, sir? My seconds? Baron Miklós Wesselényi. No one was there? They've moved out. To a hiding place. Only that young craftsman stayed. They want to hide her. But I won't leave it at that... We'll find her! They're coming. The attempt at reconciliation failed. Honour must be satisfied. The parties will exchange bullets twice, first at twenty-five paces, then at fifteen. The marks are clear! Don't put it out. I invite the parties to take their places. Ready! I'll count to three. One... Two... Three... Fire! No one's hurt. Continue! Are you hurt? Are you hurt? My ear... Give the settlement to the Baron, please. "Paid for." I like clean deals. Will you, please, attest that I stood his fire. It's settled. His ear? That's a good one! God bless that youth! He did it for me. - It's good news, Miska! - I'm really pleased. You're getting better and better. But these medicines... You used to cure yourself with brandy. That's over! It's drugs now. Pass me that bottle. What's in it? Brandy. Brandy? Get it yourself, it's near. I'll smack your face, insolent fellow! I made you a squire, but to me you're still a peasant. Not quite. I'm now Michael de Kiss, landowner. I've bought a nobleman's estate. How did you get the money? Honourably... at cards. I fleeced my genteel friends. But as a commoner, how could you buy a nobleman's estate? I bought a letter patent. For a mere 1000 florins. There are two dozen de Kiss families, they thronged for the money, and welcomed me as their dear relative. Here's my crest. That's how it was. Count Szentirmay! My thanks for the present, and for the visit. I'm getting lonely. You're the best of neighbors. Flóra and I know you're lonely, you've no relatives. Except the one who was banged on the ear, by God's grace. But seconded by me. - I hear you're going to Pest. - Yes. The nation needs our help as things are. This nation has a brilliant history. But its present is drab. Now comes the sermon. The rise of the nation, industry, commerce... Shall I go out and sell groceries? Give me a light, I'll try your present. Surely the fate of the nation interests you. And if not, how about the Kárpáthy name? I'm a lonely wolf. No children... If only I had one... After my death, there'll be no direct heir. You are again in the best of health, your life is in no danger. Make something of it. Stand by us! We need factories, better farming... We need banks so that enterprising people can get credit. We need means of communication. Ships. And railways. But we need money for all this. A lot of money. My nephew bought me a coffin. Shall I buy you steam ships? Not a bad idea at that. He'll get less. It's not as simple as that. Here's the draft of the Danube Shipping Co. And of the Railway Company. And if you haven't yet bought a steam ship, subscribe 1000 florins here. This is a miracle! But a useful one. Your signature? Here. Enough, or you'll make me buy more. What if I beat him up? He's attracting attention again. This time it's a dirty bet. On a girl's innocence. She must be rich if that rascal is after her. She's very poor. But very beautiful. Like an angel. Prettier than an angel. She's real. - You know her? - I've seen her. A pure maid. She escaped from her sinful home. I know. Goodness, purity... I'm fed up with wine and women, Miska. I played the buffon with my friends. Emptiness, that's all I have left. I'm building a steam ship, but I shan't live to see it. My words and my deeds will turn to dust. No offspring... Offspring? Though I still have strength to hand on. You're not thinking of that girl? You don't know her. I know her life. Her sad fate. We might free each other from our sorrows. Well, one could make inquiries. I'm just toying with the idea. What if you donned your best dress, if I had four horses harnessed, - and you visited her guardian. - She's a commoner. Who cares? If she accepts my name, who'd dare ask where she came from? If she accepts... Miska! - Will you go? - Yes. Sir... Dear Mr. Boltay, I was sent by a friend to ask for the hand of Miss Fanny. If she will accept the offer of an old fool who is neither old or foolish as he seems. She is so young... But... I'm not so very old by your leave. I beg your pardon. This feeling is so noble, so utterly elevated, I could never blame you for it, said the youth. But it won't bring you bliss, I fear. A sigh escaped her bosom. No, she whispered... Did you like our family portraits? Very much... I enjoyed every minute of them. Did you show the Baron everything? Yes, mama. Pray, be seated among us. Thank you, Madam. A lady's feelings I can only guess at, said he. You know that. Good evening, ladies. - I've found her! - Where? Where's she hiding? Tell us! In her guardians' summer house. But I've found her! - She should come home. - We don't need her. Jenny, how can you be so heartless? She was heartless to leave us. She caused papa's death. He couldn't bear her having left home. She's corrupted. Her place is at home. Postpone the discussion, ladies. Well, Madam, this is my plan... Good evening, ladies. Welcome, sir. A cup of coffee, or hot chocolate? No, thank you, I just dropped in to pay respects to the ladies. And to have a look at the documents of our lawsuit? By your leave, Mrs. Mayer. One of my clever girls will show them to you. Well, perhaps if Miss Polly would be so kind... Listen to me, please, please. My wicked daughters have chased me away. I'm homeless... I'm lonely and miserable. I've no one but Fanny. I'm leaving town for good. This bundle contains all that I possess. Put me up for the night so that I can bid farewell to her. Only for tonight. Don't be silly! Come in! For one night. You're again my little daughter. Then we'll part for ever. You must be tired, let's go to bed. But I can't sleep. I want to look at you. You're beautiful. Mother, please! Beauty is a treasure, God's gift... But it doesn't last. Klotild and Polly have beauty. They're putting it to bad use. Don't wrong them. I forgive them. But I've only one daughter left: you. I used to have such creamy, velvety skin. Good night. I'll stay! Come what may. I'm your mother, I won't leave you alone. Aren't you pleased? But of course. I must take care of you. Someone has to defend you. Uncle George is old, what'll become of you if he dies? Are you asleep? No, dear. I'd like to ask you something. Do you know a... Baron Kárpáthy? He often waits on us. He wants to make your acquaintance. He sits on the sofa you embroidered, and dreams about you. János Kárpáthy? Silly child. Abellino Kárpáthy! Handsome, witty, well-travelled, and the only heir to the fortune. He wants to marry me? Yes! Not now, of course... His uncle would disinherit him for such a marriage. Later. When the old man dies. You'll be so happy. He'll take you to Paris, Rome, you'll be queen of the world... When János Kárpáthy dies. Don't be silly, he can't last long now... And I should travel to Paris and Rome with Baron Abellino as what? As his intended. I see. He'll make you happy. Look! An invitation! For you, in French. Miss Fanny Mayer and Family. To Baron Fegyverneky's ball the day after tomorrow. Abellino is inviting you to show he's in earnest. He's proved it too. He'll deposit 60 thousand florins for you and me in case he doesn't marry you. But he will, there's no doubt. When János Kárpáthy dies. Till then I'm to travel as Abellino's intended. For 60 thousand florins. - I don't understand you... - But I understand you. I'm not a child. You're a clever girl, aren't you? At the ball... On Thursday. What is your answer? On Thursday. Will you be there? To give your answer? I shall answer... you and Baron Abellino. On Thursday. Let's sleep now. Your letter made me leave my Paris business and hasten here. Expenses, loss of profit... Your baron will have to pay up. No one thought the old man would recover. Doctors can be mistaken, just as you were. Luckily I didn't send the 200 thousand francs but brought them with me. The baron certainly knows I can't be at his disposal as things are. He suspects it, but he'll manage somehow. Mr. Griffard, you'll enjoy yourself. We always spoil our guests from the West. Welcome, gentlemen! Delighted to see you. Why are you so late? We were talking about money. We didn't want to bore you. Money never bores me. You put me into an awkward position. Who've invited you to my party? Oh, the Mayer girls! The end justifies the means. Anything for a bet. Madam! Fanny will be here in a minute. We came somewhat earlier, but... - Is she coming? - Who could resist your invitation? She'll give you her answer. - Which is? - Does your heart not tell you? I'll get 100 ducats from you. Baron and Baroness Kárpáthy! It's me who'll get 100 ducats from you. But it's not me who'll lend them to you. Tomorrow we'll visit the Szentirmays. A month has passed. I don't want to offend our neighbors, our friends. Who is Count Szentirmay? A fine person. A bit odd: steam ships, banks... These are his hobby. But his wife is an angel. You'll see. The newest fashion. Straight from Paris. Isn't it funny? - Can I try it? - Of course. It suits you. Want it? It's yours. No, thank you. - May I? - Of course. Who is he? My husband. Before we were married. A pity he isn't at home. But we'll all meet next week. Your husband will show us his dogs. The parade is over. The rest is up to the judges. As is the custom in England, the winner will get a medal. Till lunch let's go boating. It's the truth. The truth? That her mother and sisters...? It's only a half-truth. She fled from them. Into a rich marriage. I like her. You're so quiet. Are you well? Of course... Yes. You seem to be worried. No. I... ...only think I... - You think? - But I'm not quite sure. You mean... I shall have a son? A son! A son! Everything's taken care of. Thank you, Flóra. Does János like mutten grilled or roast? Cook is a family heirloom. She'll know. - What did the doctor say? - I can get up tomorrow. Thank God. I'm sorry the other guests had to leave. - János adores guests. - But we stayed. Yes. You and Rudolf. The main thing is, keep calm. I was so frightened! It came at a bad time. That's true. But you're all right now. We've been here four days. The others have left. She's better now. Listen to me, dear. I have many enemies. They'd be happy to get at me through gossip about you. About... me? Because of your friendship... With Fanny. Fanny is good. Maybe. But if she shouldn't be? You surprise me. All right, let's stay on. I'm sorry you need proof to convince you. My words were enough before. And János? He's with Flóra. Showing her the colts. They left me alone. I'll take the opportunity to say goodbye. We are leaving. Do sit down. So... my husband sent you to wait on me? It's a task I accept with pleasure. Is this a compliment? If I didn't honour you so much, I might say it was a confession. Why do you say such things? Because as luck would have it, we're alone. - Don't go on, please. - My apologies. Did I hurt you? No. These attentions aren't new to me. Old husband, young wife... Some men feel it their duty. I beg you... Everybody was in Bratislava when Parliament was sitting. They all know I was a Mayer girl. Let us not talk about that. Why not? It's no secret. People are talking about it. Behind my back, of course. And you started it. You... When you said: "As luck would have it, we're alone." I feel ashamed. Why did you get up? We're alone... Well? You misunderstood me. No. I'm not a child. Maybe I never was. One soon grows up in the Mayer household. Please... Please, allow me to go. Why did you come? We accepted a kind invitation. Your husband's. It's not that. Why did you come now? At this time? Alone? This is János Kárpáthy's house. I'm his wife. And I want to try to brighten the last years of a man who redeemed me from the name I bore. Why did you come? It was a mistake. It's a pity. Yes. I've been living at peace. In tranquility... It's a pity you came. There's something that I... Go on. Too late. Goodbye. Flóra! We're leaving. So you still believe the gossip? No. Not a single word of it. I'm expected in Pest. But you can stay on. It was me you wanted to spare. Now it's her. Your friend is the best of wives. And she wants to have peace. Peace and quiet. Let's help her. Your hopes are shattered now. The child to be born will be Kárpáthy's lawful heir. His lawful heir. I bet he's not the father, damn him! He let his wife to be unfaithful just to do me out of it. Now tell me... What should I do? I'm a solicitor, that is true, but I'm a gentleman and a nobleman as well. So I won't advise you to bribe your uncle's servants to have the couple spied upon. I wouldn't dream of it! Nor will I advise you to have the mail of the Baroness inspected, or her visitors, at every hour of the day. And I won't advise you to enter an action for bastardization thus dishonouring your family. But... If you want to bring a suit, if you have proofs, and if you trust me, I'll act on your behalf because as well as being a gentleman, - I'm also a solicitor. - I see. I'll set things going... It's up to you, sir. If I were you, I'd try to find out what the relationship was between the Baroness and their neighbour Count Szentirmay. Come! You're crazy! He's been in Pest for six months. The child is expected in about three months. Reckon it out. Do you hear? He's crying. He's roaring! A strong boy. My son! He'll be a great man, he's greeted by the bells. That insolent doctor threw me out. I've hardly seen my son yet. I couldn't touch him. You're only the father. The father. I'm a father, Miska. Father of Zoltán Kárpáthy. His tutors will worry about his brains... We'll teach him to farm, to fence, to ride and hunt, and to drink. - Miska! - Only a little. Not as you did in past times. You're crazy, Miska! He's only just born, and you'd make him drink? He must get to know life. He's stopped. What can it be? He's out of breath. He'll start again in no time. - Can I go in? - No, stay, please. I want to talk to you. Be a mother to him. János... Dear János... No one shall enter here for a long time. And I shall not see these rooms again. I've little time left. After my death, you'll be the guardian of my son. Raise him to be a better man than I was. On his eighteenth birthday, have that wall broken down. Take Zoltán in, show him where his mother lived. Till then silence. Deep silence. Screenplay: Director: Cinematographer: Composer and conductor: Starring: Production designer:
