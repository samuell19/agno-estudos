[Crickets chirping] [Birds chirping] Captioning made possible by lions gate entertainment [explosion] [Indistinct shouting] [Gavel pounding] Man: We have no exit from this freeway, Mr. Kirk! How am I gonna sell my gasoline? Woman: We can't live without tourists. We'll just die, that's all. Man: Without an exit, we won't have any business here. A whole lot of stores are gonna have to close! Quiet! Shh! I understand your irritation. But our studies indicate that the town of ticlaw does not qualify for an exit based on our demographic analyzation. [Shouting] No! No. You're just too small! All: Too small? Please, now, come on. There--there's an-- there is an exit... 35 miles south, the town of Marshall. But they'll get all our tourists! [Shouting] Now, now, now, now-- hey, hey, hey! Look! We can't give every little piddly-assed town an exit! [Shouting] Piddly-assed town? Kirby, talk to that man! Man: Kirby, talk to him! Now, Mr. Kirk has come all the way down here from Tallahassee, and I don't think we all should be rude to the man. However, I do think it's time that, uh, Mr. Kirk and I had a little chat. How about some lunch? [Kirby narrating] I have never liked dealing with the government. The only time you hear from them is when they want to take something from you or do something to you. But this here hotel of mine has been the focal point of this town since the Indians. Of course, some of the guests seem to have been here since the Indians, too. But we've been makin' all kinds of improvements to attract some new tourists-- a younger crowd. And this man here is tryin' to keep them tourists from gettin' here. Mornin', James. Kirk: Great lion. Hmm! Kirby: He's got the runs right now, but by the time we get our exit, we expect him to be stable and healthy. Mm-hmm. Anyway, we got 2 more comin', plus a rhino. [Elephant trumpeting] Kirk: Oh, my. Now, there s an elephant. Kirby: That's bubbles. She's a genius. Won't make a whole lot of difference if no one comes to see her. Well, it won't take a genius to get people here, I don't think. That's right. What it'll take is an exit from your freeway. How do we get it? You take 10,000 trips under the table. That's how you do it. 10,000-- 10,000 trips under the table. Payable in cold, hard, green, laundered you-know-what. You want it? We want it. [Marching band playing] [Indistinct chatter] 73, 74, 75, $76. Come and get your balloons! Ok, let me take your money. Throw a pie and save ticlaw. Throw a pie and save tic--. [Woman laughing] Kirby: We have a great turnout, honey. I think we're gonna make it. Woman: Oh, yes! All right! Thank you! Thank you! Woman: Oh, it's wonderful! [Laughs] Pancakes! Pancakes! Get your pancakes! How much is that? $170! That makes it over-- that's 170. That's over $10,000! [Cheering] That one there is yours. Looks like you got your exit, Mr. Calo. Yes, sir. We all got what we wanted. God bless you, boy. Bye-bye. Bye, now. Now, forget you saw any of this. Man: Saw what, Mr. Kirk? [Kirby narrating] Well, we all thought that was that. We had ourselves a real victory for our piddly-assed town. [Applause] Man over P.A.: Andrew Jackson freeway! Kirk, what the hell is this? You promised US an exit, and now this damn freeway's open. The other 3 commissioners voted no on ticlaw. Now, I mean, who-- who would've guessed? I don't give a fuck about the other 3 commissioners. I gave you $10,000, not the other 3 commissioners. Now, you see my people over there? Kirby, that thing's gotta come down. We got plenty more signs where that one come from. Now, we're gonna make a big stink right here! Oh, no, you're not! I'm talkin' to the governor. Governor! Governor! [Kirby narrating] Well, what do you expect? You lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas. But the point is, you get up and you do something. Now, I knew at that very moment tourists from all over america were headed toward Florida. And what we had to do was to figure out how to get 'em into ticlaw. * the highway stretches out * * just like a snake across the land * * it tells a simple story * that everyone can understand * * leave your worries all behind you * * there's a better life ahead * * and the highway gypsies follow * * every word the highway says * * it's a honky tonk freeway * it's america on wheels * motel rooms, neon lights * drive-in, drive-out meals * well, it's winding cross the country * * just as far as you can see * * on the honky tonk freeway [bus horn honking] * it's where I wanna be come on, come on. Move it, move it, move it! [Bus horn honking] Do we have to go so fast, sister? [Bus horn honking] [Bus horn honking] Oh, sister, we're going much too fast. Uh, we're only going 45 miles an hour. Yes, but that's much too fast. Put on your brakes. Oh, sister, if I put on my brakes-- I am your superior. Put on your brakes. [Brakes squealing] Oh, shit! [Brakes squealing] Oh. That's better. * it's a honky tonk freeway * it's a paradise on wheels * motel rooms, neon lights * drive-in, drive-out meals * well, it's winding cross the country * * just as far as you can see * * on the honky tonk freeway * that's where I wanna be [dog barking] I'm o.J.-- O.J.

Look at that. Straight arm. I'm o.J. Simpson. Why did we wear our uniforms? They'll know it was US. They'll never suspect it was real sanitation men. They'll think we stole the uniforms. Who would steal the uniform of a sanitation man? Woman: Next! People. Crazy people. Look around you. You know, they cut off my welfare checks, and I was going to Israel with that money. Here, boy. [Laughing] Man: I'm sorry. I can't cash it for you. Woman: It's a government check. It's a state check, and you only have $8 in your checking account. It's bank policy. Bank policy. Bank policy. [Muttering] Ooh, I didn't know that cantaloupes was in season. Please, I don't wanna get caught. Who's gonna catch US? Bum: Ok! [Laughing] I hear that prison is unpleasant. It's crowded. The food is no good. Nobody cares! Woman: Next! I need this check cashed. Please! Next! She scares me. I'll handle her. Woman 1: Talk to an officer. Woman 2: I already talked to an officer. He said he couldn't help me! Then I can't help you either. [Crying] Excuse US. Checking or savings? Neither. Well, then I can't help you. Go to the end of the line. It's a robbery. Oh, shit. I need this today. Shit this. And if you try anything funny, I'll blow your ugly head right off. Man: Eugene! Would you shut up? I never seen you become so abusive. I'm robbin' a bank. I don't have to be nice. Mary, what do I do when I'm being robbed? You give US the money. That's what you do, beard-face. Eugene! Would you shut up with that Eugene bit? You give 'em the money. Next! You would give them all your money, and you won't cash a government check? Dear, they have a gun. [Grunts] Please! I talked to an officer twice! What's the problem, miss? I don't know. Maybe you can help me. I'm an actress, I'm on unemployment, and they won't cash my unemployment check. You have any identification? W-Well, sure. Here's my driver s license. All right. I'll initial it. But just this once. That doesn't mean anything. Eugene. Cash the check, Turkey tits. How would you like that, ma'am? In cash. [Mumbling] Come on. Load it up, miss piggy. [Bum shouting] Thank you so much. I find you enormously attractive. How would you like to accompany US to the sunny state of Florida? Oh, gee, I'd really love to, but I have an audition. Then sit on my face, bitch. Greatest football player that ever lived! [Horns honking] [Tires screeching] [Tires screeching] [Horns honking] [Dogs barking] [Siren wailing] Act like you're a garbage man. You better become a garbage man. I'm o.J. Simpson! There he is!

Is that the right bag? Of course it's the right bag. Are you sure that's the right bag? I'm positive! [Shouting in foreign language] Eugene! You son of a bitch! It's all right! What's gonna be all right? An empty fuckin' can of garbage! Yes! The money! [Both laughing and shouting] We're rich!

Woman on TV: It's a great pleasure now to introduce my next guest, Barbara Reese, formerly Bob Reese. A woman who underwent a sex change-- a sex operation. Um, mittens, boys. Welcome, Barbara. Barbara, man's voice: Thank you, Kelly. How did your wife first react to the news when you went to her and you said to her, "I want to be a woman"? Well, she was not at all pleased. [Shouting] Daddy! Denny! Munch, munch! [Growling] Be good while I'm away. Kelly on TV: When did you first decide, Barbara, that you wanted to be a woman, not a man? Barbara: Well, actually, I first decided when I was a soldier during the Vietnam war. Jimmy dropped his cap. Barbara: I believe it was during the tet offensive. Oh, they left their mittens. Yes, Duane. Kelly: Well, did you manage to keep your same job? [TV making whirring noises] Barbara: I did get my old job back, yes. I do the same work that I always did, the only difference being that I get paid less for it now. Is something burning? Kelly: You have 2 children. It's your book. Duane: My book? By your longtime marriage. How do they react to the fact that you're-- Mrs. Hansen: No parent in their right mind would buy a book for their child called Ricky, the carnivorous pony. Your stories are sick, Duane. My stories are funny, char. I don't find them funny. And I don't find you funny. Barbara: See, they think that their father is away on a job, and-- Kelly: But what do they call you? Auntie.

Sherm, wait for me. Carol. Your nose is powdered, your lipstick's on, your hair is combed. You look fine. Come on. Let's have lunch. Sherm, I'm not drunk. Oh, god! It's just a little accident. It's just a little accident. Do you have to booze it up, Carol? A mixed drink is not booze, sherman. It's a cocktail. A before-dinner drink. But dinner isn't for 5 hours yet. Ah, yes. But what you're forgetting, sherm, is that time is relative. To what, Carol? Life? No, sherm. Need. Time is relative to need. Einstein was wrong. Terrific car. Look at that. Hey, uh, and terrific stuff, too. Let's take the car and the stuff. Nope, that's wrong. We're not gonna take their stuff. What, are you crazy? Nope. Come on. Nope. You've gotta be nuts. Will you try it for a few weeks? Sherm, I'm not an alcoholic. Your mother was an alcoholic. Where did she do her drinking? Alone. You see? Now, am I alone? And did she hide her bottle in the rice krispies and the laundry hamper and shoe box? Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Now, these are symptoms of the alcoholic. Classic symptoms. Do I have any of these symptoms? No, you don't. Thank you. Can I get you anything to drink? I'll have 5 old-fashioneds. Coke for me. Do you realize, sherman, I have never purchased a bottle of liquor in my life? Oh, I know that. So how could I be an alcoholic if I've never purchased a bottle of liquor? Carol, you're having 5 old-fashioneds for lunch. That is an alcoholic. I'm hungry. Besides, these are mixed drinks. Do you know an alcoholic anywhere who only drinks mixed drinks? The other four will be here right away. No hurry. This place is so cute. Cheers. [Sighs] Cheers. Didn't your ad agency name the swizzle stick, sherm? No. Weaver, O'Leary and mudge named the swizzle stick in 1924. You notice how I never suck my orange slice? That's the sure sign of an alcoholic. Just go to one meeting, Carol. Try it. Please. No. Someone is stealing our car, sherm. What? You're already mumbling, Carol. It's only 1:30, and you're mumbling. Why would they steal the car and leave the luggage? Just try it for a few weeks. Well, it looks like our car. Carol, if you pass out with your head against the window while I'm driving, I'm just gonna pull over onto the shoulder. I swear it. It's too lonely driving like that. Sherm, will you please look-- oh, look it here. Honey, could you pour me another cup of coffee? Caffeine. Caffeine. [TV playing indistinctly] [Sighs] Isn't this beautiful? Mm-hmm. This is monument valley, kids. Delia, little Billy, look at monument valley. TV: I'm a doctor, I know that-- kids, you know, this is where our forefathers carved their way through the wilderness all by themselves. Mommy, I have to go potty. Oh, crud. Euphemisms. We're looking for a place. We're gonna stop soon, pumpkin. Mr. Kramer: We are not going to stop until we are in new Mexico. Little Billy, you can use the r.V. Bathroom. He does not like to use the bathroom in the r.V. But hurry, mommy. I have to go tinkle. Mrs. Kramer: He has to go tinkle. Crud. Why can't you just call it what it is? Delia. Say, "I have to urinate." Delia. Say, "I have to piss." Say, "I have to let go with the yellow flow." Delia! Put that down. Little Billy, now, you can use the r.V. Bathroom. It's got one. That's why we bought the n-25 unit. Just go back there and use it like a man. No! He doesn't like the r.V. Bathroom. He likes to pee in gas stations. He's a freak! [Laughs] It's just a phase. Do you know how many root canals I did to pay for this damn thing? 96. I bought it so we could all be together. So far, nobody's eaten in it, nobody's slept in it, so he can damn well pee in it! You know something? I've just about had it with all of you. Next summer, they can go off to summer camp, and you and i-- ok, ok. You can go where you wanna go, and I will go somewhere else. Kirby: Now, a number of you people have been comin' up to me and sayin' that this town is failing. But I think god wants US to be successful. Hallelujah! All: Hallelujah! Hallelujah for ticlaw! All: Hallelujah for ticlaw! But he's testing you. Yes, he is. The lord said, "what you give unto me, I will return onto you tenfold." Well, one of our brothers sittin' right here amongst US on his income tax only reported fivefold. And the government didn't like that. [Murmuring] But he had faith, a loving wife and a great accountant. Praise god for our brother! All: Praise god! We are all, each and every one of US, being tested. Now, one of the loveliest creatures in our congregation came to me and she said, "reverend, I am hooked on valium." Yes, she did! [Murmuring] "I cannot even go to the 7-Eleven store without taking 3 valiums," she said. "I am afraid--" she said, "I am afraid that one night "while I am serving dinner, "I will trip and fall "into the shag carpet and disappear, never to come up again." I said, "woman, you get up!" And she did get up, found faith, and she found god! [Shouts of "amen"] And she threw away her valium. Yes, she did. We are all being tested, each and every one of US. The lord said to me, "build a safari park in ticlaw." Then they came along and built their superhighway right next to US. [Murmuring] He didn't say nothin' about no exit. But that is our test-- how to get them here with no exit. So we're gonna try everything and anything, and I mean anything, and we are gonna rise up to this challenge. Yes, we are. We are gonna soar like eagles if we stick together. If we stand up and sing together, because we got faith! * oh, ticlaw, ticlaw * wonderful, beautiful part of heaven * * ticlaw, ticlaw * wonderful, beautiful town * * oh, ticlaw, ticlaw * wonderful, beautiful part of heaven * * ticlaw, ticlaw * wonderful, beautiful town * man: Kirby, I think this is crazy, man. Look, people are startin' to complain, and I really feel that it's illegal. This is not illegal. And we are desperate. This is a resort town. We gotta get our tourists here. Yeah, but I'm the sheriff of this town, man. I'm the mayor! I'm the minister of the ticlaw baptist church. I'm the president of the rotary of the elks, and I have 2 lions and a rhinoceros coming here. And I warned you about that. I told you that's a dumb idea, that safari park. Don't be afraid to pour it on there, r.G.! There are too many safari parks in Florida. This place is startin' to look like Africa. And the next thing you'll want me to do is walk around with a spear and a bone through my nose. Well, now, that ain't a bad idea. Oh, no. Why don't you come out and join US and help US and give US a hand? No. Do it for me as a favor. Man, I don't know. Well, then, do it for private enterprise. Do it for the little guy, for Christ s sakes. Sheriff: I don't know, Kirby. Ok, all clear now! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Woman: Come on, now, honey bubbles. Take another donut, and pull. Come on. Pull! That's it. One more, now. All right. Oh, that's beautiful! Could I, uh-- excuse me, could I have more coffee, please? Bitch. [Indistinct chatter] Thanks. Thank you. Here. This waitress-- hey, are you a-- [chuckles] No, you go on. Oh, nothin'. I was just gonna say that these waitresses are impossible. Yeah? They don't care. It's kinda late and all. What's your name? Duane Hansen. I'm Carmen Odessa Shelby. Are you a writer or somethin' or what? No. No, uh-- what do you do? I'm a waitress. [Chuckles] You makin' fun of me now or what? [Chuckles] No. I bet you're a good waitress. What, um-- what's in that thing there? Is that, uh, pebbles? Seashells? What? Actually, it's my mother. What? Well, she wanted to be cremated. She was real dramatic and she said, "when I'm gone, burn me up." So, I did. Hey, what's your name again? Duane. Mama, this is Duane. Duane, this is my mama, lolita Shelby. It's kind of hard to believe there's a 250-pound woman in there with dirty hair and a double chin, now isn't it? Yeah. It's kind of-- my mama wore wigs. For the past 3 days, I've been throwin' out wigs, wigs and more wigs. Anyway, uh, what do you do? I repair copy machines. That's difficult. You can't get just anybody to do that. You got a skill. You wouldn't wanna go have a drink or something? A drink or something? Yeah. Well, gosh. I don't know, it's-it's late. Yeah, it's late. So what? Do you--do you live alone or what? No, I live with my-- i-- I'm sorry about your mother. Yeah. We were friends. She was a waitress, too. And we were gonna go on vacation together. So that's why I say you just gotta live day by day. And the future? I talk too much. Nobody wants to hear it. Everybody thinks I'm crazy. Well, we're all crazy. Right? [Chuckles] So hey, what's your sign? * look at those women look at those men * * throwin' their lives away * * hopin' lady luck will get them down * * this honky tonky freeway * and there's, there's a rhino loose * * ooh, she loves that juice * * she hits the nearest bar then waves to every car * * she's got nothin' else to do * * everybody's goin' faster faster * * everybody's goin' faster faster * [music fades] [Moans] Oh, it's kinking up on me again. Ooh! I know what's wrong with you. No, you don't. Yes, I do. You don't know. You don't. I do know. I do. Honey, would you just relax? I'm relaxed. Are we there yet? Almost, sweetheart. When will we be there? Soon. Little Billy. What? [Water running] Freak! [Indistinct chatter] I'm gonna try it again. [Engine cranking] [Horn honking continuously] [Horn stops] I can't stand this. I can't stand it. They can take away my job, they can take away our house and make US live in a condominium with a bunch of old farts, but they cannot take away my car! [Horns honking] Give me back my car, you bastards! Give me back-- give me back my car! Stop it, sherman. Get back in this car. Get control of your life! I have never seen you like this. I liked that car. It was my prize. I know. It was an honor. Best ad man-- 1956, 57, 58. 1954, 55, 56, Carol. Will you get my career straight just for once? Where's the tow truck? It's not coming. They're not gonna even let US die in Florida playing shuffleboard. It's gonna be right here, tonight, Carol. Don't be morbid. The truck will come. I can see my New York times obituary right now. "Sherman schaffler "sneezed himself to death in a rented car by the side of the road with his alcoholic wife." Oh, I-I m sorry. I didn t mean that. I know. Well... I'm going to walk to the nearest gas station. I'll go with you. We're in this together. * years from now [Carol grunting] * I'll want you * years from now * and I'll love you [horn honking] * years from now * as I love you tonight hi.

Son of a bitch. Have a good day. Slide through, Carol. * still, love has kept US together * would you like to go for a cocktail? Oh, well, if you want one. [Starts engine] Would you believe it? Husbands send in naked pictures of their wives with little comments for $50. Who would do a thing like that? Huh? [Sneezes] Why do you sneeze every time you look at a naked woman? I got a cold. A cold, huh? Are you sure it's not an allergy? Listen to this. "Annie Jo Wheeler. A social worker. "Into needlepoint, stock cars, charity work and group sex." Who the hell are these people?

He could be a cop. He's gonna have to sit next to our money. So, you're a student? Yeah. Yeah, I am. Yeah. What's so funny about that? I see nothing funny in that question. Nothing. I'm sorry. Like, I'm wrecked, you know? Man, I can't hitch on these freeways unless I'm just completely wrecked. You know what I mean, man. Sure. A lot of these weirdoes pick you up. And vicey-versy.

I'm her manager. What kind of manager? Personal manager. Oh, yeah? You wanna get lucky? Yeah. Just wait here. Woman on P.A.: Paging Mr. David Samuels. Could you please pick up a courtesy phone? Come on, guys! We're all goin' up to Wally s room! What room's he in? 307! I have a reservation. I have a reservation. Ma'am, our computer shows no record of that. And we are booked up, so we have no room for you. I am sorry. You have no room for US? I cannot believe this is happening! I cannot believe this is happening to US. Well, it happened to Joseph and Mary, and that turned out ok. Wait, wait. What is your last name? I have no last name. Just for the computer, what is your last name? Christ. Excuse me? Well, technically, since we're all brides of Christ, our last-- sorry. Well, I have a Claire, a Clinton, a clarise-- oh, that's me. That's me. Sister clarise. Well, ma'am, it simply says "m. Clarise." It does not say "sister clarise." Yes, well, that's me. [Sighs] Do you have a driver's license? She doesn't drive. We've had a lot of people stealin' television sets, ladies, so we're crackin' down security-wise. Do you have a major credit card? We are nuns! Look, honey, I don't care what you are. I have a corporation breathing down my back. We don't have credit cards. We'll pay in cash. [Sighs] That causes a lot of problems for me, but all right. All right. You'll be in room 219. That's in the purple cluster. Here's your computer cards. You'll use these instead of keys. Kevin! Kevin will show you to the purple cluster. Have a nice day. Hi, I'm Kevin.

They're gonna get off down there at the next exit and they're gonna come all the way back to here. Kirby, if these signs are illegal-- it doesn't matter. This'll be a beautiful day for ticlaw. Oh, look, they're slowin' down. Look! I think the signs are gonna work. * ticlaw * ticlaw Duane: Oh, Carmen. All my life, I've been waiting for someone like you. I'm overweight. Mmm. I don't care. Did you know that Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system? Look. I always sit in this booth. It's the same no matter what state you're in or what city. This booth remains the same. The international house of pancakes is the one consistent thing in my life. Man: Try 2375. Second man: Son of a bitch. Try 9164. Stupid technology! I don't believe it! Here, here, let me try. [Lock clicks] At least we got the trunk. Mmm. Yeah. Let's take the Chevy. All right. Carmen, I'll go with you. I'll help you spread your mother around Miami beach. How's that? Oh, I don't know, Duane. See, that's what I mean about my mama. She just loved messin' up everybody's life. Now if I sprinkle her around down there on that beach, a big wind'll come up and blow her all over those people. You know they got suntan oil on them, and they gotta wash my mama off of 'em. Someone they never even knew. See? She'll be affecting them, and they ll never even know. Waitress: Strawberry-- I love you. Oh, Duane. You don't even know me. I've slept with over 300 men. Everyone has their faults. 300 men in paducah, Kentucky? Duane, it wasn't easy. It's an accomplishment. No, Duane. It's a problem. It's a real problem. I'm like Ricky, the carnivorous pony in respect to men. I love you, I need you, and I want to make you happy. That's all. Oh. I don't know if that's what I really want out of life. Woman: Oh, boy, Eddie, you really picked a winner for me last night. Man: Why? What? You really did. This guy gets me into his room and opens up his briefcase and pulls out a dog collar. I knew I was in trouble. I mean, then he has me sitting in the corner on a newspaper, barking. And then he goes over to the sofa and he slaps his thigh twice, and he goes--[Whistles] I can't believe you took mastercharge. I don't know how I'm gonna collect that. So then I go over to the sofa and I sit down, and he slaps me across the face, and he knocks me down on the floor, and he goes, "bad dog. "You know you're not supposed to be up on the sofa, you bad dog." It's not funny, Eddie. Ok. I was ready to call the a.S.P.C.A. On the guy. I'm not doing the doggie bit ever again. Now, come on. It's a lot better than that-that Nazi bit you did in Vegas. So what's a little barking? You know, I could've taken along any of the other girls. And they're a lot less trouble than you. But who did I take? I took you, because I want you with me. You weren't even in the room when I got back. I'm right here. I'm not doing this anymore, Eddie. No, you're gonna do what I tell you, or you're gonna end up back in that supermarket where I found you. What's this? Don't you have anything smaller? Hey! Hey! Hey!

Ticlaw inn and safari park straight ahead. Now keep it moving there, lady. Oh, my god. [Groans] Free gas. Plenty of free gas right here on your left. Thank you. Keep moving. Free gas on your left. [Continues, indistinct] Free restaurants. Free parking and gasoline. Come and get your free gasoline. Jesus. We gotta stop that. This time it's gonna work. I don't think she likes this. Don't worry. Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to see a first. Kirby! Kirby! Mr. Kirk, you got here just in time. You can have a chorus line of water-skiing elephants, but you can't take the law into your own hands. Now? In just a sec. Those billboards have got to come down. They're illegal. The oil companies won't tolerate you giving away free gasoline. Well, you can stick the oil companies where the sun don't shine. [Cheering] You'll pay for this. We already have. And I think you can go now. Go! Now! [Applause] [All gasp] [Trumpeting] Kirby: Damn! Damn! [Car horn honking] Kirby, you're gonna be killed! What's the matter with you? This thing! This thing is gonna drive US off the face of the earth. Honey, we'll figure a way. We always have! I must be crazy to have pinned our future on a pink town, a half-assed safari park and a damn bitch elephant who can't even water ski. What you are is drunk and about to be splattered all over the freeway. Now, come on. [Coughing] If she'd get up just once, they'd come. Hell, I would. I'm dying of curiosity. Oh, honey. You'll do it. You'll do it. * everybody's going faster, faster * * everybody's going faster-- * who gets the hamburgers, who gets the fries? The lion gets the burgers, the rhino gets the fries. This'll only take a minute. Hey, I'm in no hurry. They'll eat this stuff? They ain't got much of a choice, do they? Hey! Whoa! Wh-whoa! [Shouting, screaming] [Animals growling, snarling] Do I look ok? You look fine. Does my ass look big? Your ass looks small. Do I smell good? You smell fine. What is it with you? These are hookers, not debutantes. Hey, could I ask one thing? Could we both try to finish our endeavors at roughly the same time? So I don't have to wait around like last time, huh? Absolutely. I just don't want to be kept waiting, ok? [Sneezes] Woman on TV: While your pig is marinating, prepare a glorious stuffing, using one fresh, diced pineapple, one ounce guava paste, one pound of chopped macadamia nuts, 3 large onions, chopped, one pound of diced ham, 3 ounces coconut cream-- [women snickering] And 20 kumquats. Mix all of these ingredients together in a large mixing bowl, and reserve. Hi! I'm sorry about last night. It'll never happen again. I promise. Please forgive me. You kept me waiting all night long. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, please forgive me. Pretty please. All right. You're forgiven. Ok. Just let me tell you about the last one. Ohh. The last one was the best. Look, it's not that I have anything against hookers. I just like a nice, clean virgin, that's all. Clarise: Will you hurry? What are you doing in there? [Knocking on door] Coming, sister. Are you all right? Yes, sister. Man on radio: So don't miss it. Visit Eli's hardware this week only. Super sale of super power tools at Eli's. And when you go in, be sure and tell them Toby neumeier sent you. Speaking of bargains, ferns on the highway, Carlyle's favorite eatery, offers egg dishes cooked the way you like 'em. [Knocking on door] Sister, are you all right in there? Yes, sister. Well, hurry up, then. All ready. I'm going to have to tell the new mother superior about you. I'm tired of your nonsense. Where's the car? It's right-- well, where? Shit. It appears, sister, that you've lost our car. I didn't lose the car. I put it right there. You put our luggage right there. Did you leave the keys in the car? Uh, no. They're here somewhere. Oh, this damn robe. What did you say? Oh, uh, my vestments. I haven't gotten used to my vestments yet. It's habits, habits. How many times do I have to tell you? You really are hopeless. Will you pick up your suitcase? We're going to walk. Walk? Yes. To Miami beach? Yes. Maybe we'll get a ride. Kirby: God said, "I will provide for you in abundance." Well, we need an exit, and I'm here to tell you that everything is possible for the righteous. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The israelites-- they had their backs up against the red sea with the Egyptians coming directly at 'em. Did they give up? No, they had faith in god. And he parted the red sea, and the israelites had their exit. And we're gonna get ours, no matter what we have to do. [Cheering] And we're gonna have people here. We will. When we get 'em here, what are we gonna show 'em? We're gonna show 'em a real good time. Now, let me hear you say it. We're gonna show 'em a real good time. A real good time! A real good time! A real good time! * the highway stretches out * * just like a snake across the land * * it tells a simple story everyone can understand * look at the water! It's so blue! Oh, this is it! Mama, mama!

I'd like to start with the lobster bisque. Eddie: Grace. You're kind of lonely, aren't you? Eddie, please. Kinda. I can cure that. Hey, I'm in love with a guy. Oh, well, of course you are. But does he make you happy? Here's my question-- are you unhappy in your present job? You sound like a commercial on television at 2:00 A.M. You know, she's right, Eddie. You do, sort of. Yes, of course she's right. But you see, what I'm selling they don't offer on TV. I'm not talking about a truck driver's course or some sort of slicer-dicer in the kitchen, grace. Oh, yeah? Well, what are you talking about? Grace, what I'm selling-- and this is a one-time offer-- is the opportunity for you to get out of here and make some real money. You ever been to New York? No. Think about it, grace. When you deliver that next fishburger, ask yourself, "is this what I want out of life?" And then consider my offer, because this offer expires with dessert. Well, I think I better get back to my station. I'm sitting up front, Eddie. I'm sitting up front. Ok, then. Who gets the crabs? Honey, we all do sooner or later. [Laughter] Cheeseburgers. All right, we got a filet of sole here. Man: Filet of sole's across there. Hi. Well, hi. Greetings and salutations. Couldn't help but notice you looking at me from across the room over there. What sign are you? Libra. I was wondering if maybe you could possibly help me out with a ride, perchance. Hi. Hi. Duane: Am I interrupting something? No, no. Yeah, I'm spanky. Spanky is the name, and cocaine is the game. Have a seat. Thank you. I was, um, just talking to your pretty little wife here. Who is this guy? He's a libra. He says he needs a ride, Duane. You didn't offer him one? No. Is he bothering you? No, he's ok. He doesn't look ok to me. Hey, what is this? Hey, something new? [Sniffing] That's my mother! [Coughing] You're shitting me. I'm sorry. Miss! You are not the only person in the world, you know. Hey, look who's here, Eugene. Thanks, gene. Eugene.

[Mouths words] Sherman: You've gotta have a phrase--"ticlaw ticks." Kirby: "Ticlaw ticks." Sherm: Or, uh, "time in ticlaw tantalizes." And show a picture of a pretty girl. See, it's the association of ideas that counts. Sell ticlaw as a sort of sexual oasis. "Our time in ticlaw was torrid." Your husband certainly knows his advertising. Does he ever. My sherm invented bad breath. Your husband invented bad breath? He fought for bad breath for years and years, and finally he got it. Carol. You did one brilliant thing, though, and that was to give everything away for free. You see, he invented this test where you put your hand in front of your mouth and you blow. Now, what you're smelling is not your breath. What you're smelling is your fingers. Shut up, Carol. [Disco music playing] Thank you very much. Good--good evening. [Sneezes] Is your room upstairs? But of course. Whoo-hoo! All right! All right! We ain't seen nothin' like this in years. You gonna love it here. Well, wasn't part of the plan, but it's a nice little place, huh? Hotels like this are part of our heritage. Yeah. Honey-- look, uh, how about tonight? Tonight? What about last night? Tonight, too. Look, I am on vacation. Hey, Carmen, what's your favorite color? I think the living room should be done in beige. I kind of like red. Well, then, reddish beige. How about the bedroom? What do you say? Whoa, Duane. I think we ought to get to know each other a little better before we start looking at paint chips. I mean, did it ever occur to you that this relationship might not work out? No. Well, my heart starts to pound if I get within 50 miles of an army base. Trouble with you is you don't know a sure thing when you see one. Oh, mama!

Tell him I'll take it in the office. Uh, Mr. Calo will be right with you. Hello, your honor. Is this Kirby calo? Yes, sir. Mr. Calo, what do you intend doing with your hostages? Hostages? We don't intend doing anything with them. We got no real use for 'em. [Speaking Vietnamese] What was that? What was that noise? Well, that's just the game room, sir. Game room? He's got 'em locked up in a game room. Well, we would like to talk to you. Sure. We'd love to meet. Remember attica? Never give in to demands. Don't meet with them. Shut the fuck up. Uh, where did you want to meet? How about right down the center of ticlaw? You'll find it. It's the town with no exit. We'll do just that. [Sighs] If we ever get this thing worked out properly, I will see to it that you work in the post office for the rest of your natural life! Hi, little Billy. Have you seen your daddy? No. You haven't? No. I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! Boy, was that ever worth it. Thank you. Good. Come again. I gotta go change my shirt. Ok? Ok. Hi. Hi. Haven't we met somewhere before? I don't think it was my station. 'Cause I'm your mother. You do what I tell you. No, you're not gonna play anymore. No. Billy: I'm gonna go and play with the gun. Bye. Bye. So, uh, how would you like to go up to the room and, uh, just be alone together? You and I? Well, I'm a little tired right now, honey. Hungry, too. Hungry.

I don't see anybody. Or anything. It's eerie. It's a trap. [Telephone rings] Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Stop the car. [Ring] Answer it. It's not for me. No one knows I'm here. Answer the phone! Hello? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. They said, get out of the cars and meet them in the middle of the street. It's a pleasure to meet you, your honor. What do you want? Well, we want what we always wanted from the beginning-- an exit for ticlaw. Well, taking hostages is not the way to go about it. Well, we tried bribery, but that didn't work. Right, Mr. Kirk? You still got the ten thou? It's around somewhere. This is worse than Watergate. Shut up. We will never give in to your demands, ever. You cannot force US-- [explosion] What in the world are you doing to those poor tourists? Oh, we're just showing them a real good time. Oh. And if I don't give in? I understand you're running for reelection, governor. Sir, I cannot participate in a cover-up. I point to Watergate-- shut up. Shut...Up. Ok. Have you got it, Mr. Kirk? Yeah. You know, it's a terrible thing when you pay for something and you don't get it. Makes you wonder who you can trust. Me. You can trust me. I deliver. That was my campaign slogan-- "I deliver." Gentlemen, I think Mr. Calo deserves an exit. [Cheering] [Speaking Vietnamese] Ohh! Oh-ho!
