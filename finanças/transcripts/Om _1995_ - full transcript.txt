You ruined your life Is that girl more important to you than your parents? Go...go to her... You don't have any place in this house Get out. I can understand your situation very well. All the doors are closed on you! Only one door is open for you. We got into this profession for some reason just like you. In this open world, people cheat, betray and ruin lives with lies.

There's no use in fearing him. Come, let's meet Commissioner directly Did Gopi come home, Madhu? - No. It seems few goons came to his school and took him away in a car. Famhemnothing has happened to you, right? Why? What happened? My husband got a call that you'd an heart attack, he came here. Didn't he come here, father? - No, dear. Oh my God! My son is also missing. Oh no, my hubby! Please stop... If you step out to lodge complaint, you're in trouble. If you enter police station, you'll lose your sister's son. When you lodge complain, you'll lose your brother: No...please forgive me, Sasi. Your life got ruined in trying to save my life I will not come to police station. I will not come What are you saying? Please forget everything that happened here as bad dream. Please forget it. Are you a woman? If you were in my place, what would you've done? Please try to understand my situation If I try to help you now, my entire family would get destroyed. This is right way to say! For your selfishness! You don't care about other's life but you and your family must be fine, right? These are not my words. I'm repeating what you told me that day! When I gave witness against your brother, I was in similar situation. But I was coward from your side. I was selfish. But what about you now? My parents and my sisters were surrounded by 40 goons A situation came to take weapons. But my father... Take it son...take it. If you tell truth to save your friend, those goons will ruin your sisters and their lives. Better to kill us all before that happens. Entire family's future depends on the decision you take today. That day I was just another ordinary man. I feared of everyone, I was too scared. I had sentiments. I made a mistake. But you punished me with this! Today, you've committed the same mistake. Tell me, what punishment do you deserve? What punishment should I give you? Till now I chased you, I threatened and forced you to love me. To tell you this truth. Till now you won and I lost. But today you lost and this victory is enough for me. Hereafter I'll not trouble you anymore I did all this to teach you a lesson. Don't think I'm mad. There's a son of happiness in this madness Hereafter we pan our ways! I'll never show my face again to you. You too don't show your face to me Whatever he said is true, Madhuri. Experiences change a man's opinion. There will be a situation for anyone's cowardice or terrorizing others. People who fail to understand the situation may feel it as injustice. You're thinking about me. What you imagine is not true, Madhuri. What happened in that room was something else.. What you thought was different... He's not a bad man as you think Nobody is born criminal, situations turn a man into bad ways. Hatred can't win over bad. Forgiveness and love can win this world. As a woman I'm telling you A woman's important character is forgivenessmlove. Try to understand this Madhuri. Go and see the condition of his family for your acts. O rose... You oozed honey of love" ls itjustice to ruin a life with your thorns? Vtflth hatred in heart, you aimed the arrow of love... For the song of vengeance" for the sheer force of it... In the guise of innocence with poisonous thoughts... ls a girl myth for the word beauty? Where's the beauty in the world with women? What made you so nasty? Forgive...forgive everything that had happened... For a hurt heart... for broken dreams... Show affection... accept your love... Accept your love for once" If love forget you, you're a lost woman... What's in your heart? Sathya, I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you. Look...look at this! Have a good look! Samhya killed Oil Raj believing that dog's words. He ripped out my stomach I took it in my stride. If I was not alert for a second, Sathya would've killed me that day. He's more my enemy than you. Yes, you must finish him We can't touch Sathya till he's with Rai. Plan something and separate them. How? What? Is he betraying me? Yes, whatever it may be we goons of Bangalore are same He's shelling out everything earned in oil business on that girl. He's itching to marry her. He's planning to finish you after uniting with her. This is what Kutty had written to Sathya. Do you believe me now? Where can I find Sathya now? Sathya...take it! Come Sathya! Who attacked them? Chief priest's son Sathya. Is that goon priest's son? What a sin has been committed, God! Wham a son you have, Shastry! You offered vermilion and flowers to God but you consecrated it with blood now. Respect, honour, prestige of this temple is ruined. Who will visit this temple now? Entire town knows your son is a goon. Shastry, this is murder case. Your son... - He's not my son, sir. He's not my son. My son is dead longtime ago. If you say your son is dead, would this town accept this? Yes, though he's bad man, he's your son. You're trying to get your daughter married to my son with a son like him! Aren't you ashamed of it? If his son is such a goon, how would his daughter be? Come, let's go. Enough of it, come Enough of them, no need of their proposal. If I had such a son, I would've conducted his obsequies while he's still alive Father... no... Don't do it, father... Where are you going, Samhya? Look...look there! I'm alive and he's conducting my obsequies Though I was not with them, I was still their son. Now they're removing me from their lives How much they would've got hurt because of me? Leave me, I must fall at his feet and seek his forgiveness. Leave me. Police are waiting to arrest you - Leave me, let them arrest me. Leave me..leave me... Leave me. - I can't leave you. I'll kill you - Kill me..kill me" Kill me! Kill me! I'm sinner...kill me. You're not a sinner, I'm sinner. I'm sinner. I sacrificed my life for love and selfishness. Am I son of that great man? God...my sisters' lives are ruined because of me. My father lost his honour. In that temple" Had I not picked weapon that day, I would've been dead by now. I wouldn't be here to see this. But today he's offering obsequies as I watch Father...father... How was l...what am I now... How am I now... No...no...there's no one for me in this world. No one! I'm there for you. I shattered your life with the cyclone I creamed. I was responsible for this. Samhya, there's no one for me other than you. No one else. I must see the old Sathya... I want my old Sathya again. Sathya, you must become your old self again. You must get out of this rut. You must come out. The world will not spare a good man like you. The men with whom you were working tried to kill you. Rai, the man for whom you work is behind this murderous attack. When I went for you, I heard Rai and Dheena's brother talking to each other No need of friendship with these bad men. Let's go far away from here... live happily. Let's work hard to make a living. How many times I've to tell you not to come after me? How many times I've to tell you? I don't love you. Go, marry a good man and live happily. If you come after me again... No...Samhya_..no... No Sathyam. Somebody please help me! Why did you come here? Do you've any sense? Is it the situation to talk about that? No, Sathya! “My are you hesitating hiding something in heart? Why do you lie that you don't love me? If you don't love me, why do you get tensed if I get hurt? This is not love but humanity. Humanity! Look at him! How brutally you've hit him! Didn't you feel that humanity on him? Do you've to do that drama to teach me a lesson? No, you loved me earlier and you still love me. Tell me truth, don't you love me, Sathya? Tell me the truth! Where are you taking me? Greetings brother: Look at her carefully... Do you want to be like her? Do you know who she is? \Mfe of a notorious goon. He loved and married her. I killed him with my hands. Do you also wish to be like her? Tell me Do you also wish to be like her? So, quit this life of violence - Quit? Wham am I to quit? My life? Riding a tiger, for good or bad, need to keep on riding it. If I get down from it, tiger may eat me. You've seen everything, picking a weapon has lead to this violence. I'll be nothing if I give up weapon. My love for you hasn't gone down a bit. That's why I say marry someone else and live happily. I don't want you to end up like her. Society will not accept Samhya as good man again.
