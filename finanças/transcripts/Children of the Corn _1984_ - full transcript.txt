[BIRDS CHIRPING] [CROW SQUAWKS] [FLIES BUZZING] [BELL TOLLING] - Morning. - Morning, priest. CHILD: It was about 3 years ago. I was the only kid in church that day. The others were with Isaac out at the cornfield. I didn't get to go 'cause dad didn't like Isaac. He was pretty smart, my dad. After church we've been to Hansen's, just like always. Sarah was homesick with mom. She'd turned down with a fever. - Morning, Dave. - Morning. - How are your wife and Sarah? CHILD: Dad was worried... so he went to call mom first thing. - I'm gonna call your mom, ok? - Okay! MR. HANSEN: You want the usual? - Yeah, strawberry shake. That's when I saw Malachai and the others. I guess the meeting with Isaac was over. They were acting real creepy. MR. HANSEN: There you go, Joby. - Thanks. - How is she? - I'm worried, Dave. The fever's gone from 101 to 104. Sure. Okay. [CROWS SQUAWKING] Good coffee. [GASPS] [GASPING AND GAGGING] [CROWD MURMURING] [GRUNTING] [ALL SHOUTING] [WHIRRING] [SCREAMING] JOBY: No! CHILD: It happened everywhere in Gatlin that day. That's when Sarah started drawing these pictures. [PARTYBLOWER TOOTS] [LAUGHING] Happy birthday! What are you doing? - You're crazy. - C'mon! Make a wish. What did you wish for? To live happily ever after. - Is that a proposal? - No, it's not. Well, I guess I'll give you this anyway. What is it? - That's nice! - Turn it over. In honor of this special occasion we'll have a birthday serenade. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. No more books and studies Now I can stay all day with my buddies I can do the things I wanna do 'cause all my exams are through I can root for the Yankees from the beaches And don't have to worry about teachers And I'm so glad that school is out I could sing and shout School is out Everybody's gonna have some fun Everybody's gonna jump and run C'mon, people Don't you be late I just got time to take my girl out today - Heh-heh. Yay. BURT: Yay. Holy cow! We better get going now. I got a lot of driving to do today. Couldn't we just say the hell with it... - and stay for a couple of hours? - I wish. Starting Monday I've got fifty patients a day to look at - I've some things you could look at. - Is that right? WOMAN: Hello? Hello? Maid service. We'll be out in a minute. We gotta get going. I'm gonna grab a quick shower before we go, okay? C'mon, honey! You're making something out of nothing. To me is something, to you is nothing. I'm just worried about this internship, okay? I've been working for this for four years. I know. I do understand. Why do you have to be such a jerk about it? Welcome to Nebraska. [ROOSTER CROWS] JOBY'S VOICE: We weren't the only ones who thought Isaac was weird. One day Joseph told us he was running away. He said he couldn't take it anymore. He was pretty scared. I wasn't. - I'm scared. - Me too. There's nothing to be afraid of. I said I'd come back for you. I promise. - Can we go with you? Please! - No. I'd never make it with you two. - But we don't like it here. - I said you'll be alright! As long as nobody finds that pictures you've been drawing. She can't help it. That won't matter to Isaac and Malachai. They'll take it as a sign. Anyway, you now crayons and drawings are forbidden. - Just like that record player. - But we like it. Isaac doesn't let us do anything. You just better mind until I get back. Or else, you know what happens. - Are you going through the corn? - I can't go no other way. - What if... - I said it'll be alright. - Unless you tell anybody I'm gone. - We won't. Cross your heat? Hope to die, stick a needle in your eye. You know what that means now? If you tell, you're gonna burn in a lake of fire for all eternity. Make sure nobody's looking. - Okay. Go! SARAH: Nobody's looking. Nobody's looking. [VICKY YAWNS] BURT: I spy... something that begins with the letter "C". - Corn. - Right. So now we know... back roads are even less interesting than the highways. Maybe they've discovered music... ALL: Hallelujah! PREACHER: There are many Lord's mansions... but there's no room for the fornicator! - No room! CROWD: No room. - for the homosexual! BOTH: No room! No room for the drugs user! BOTH: No room! Amen. Peanut butter and white bread! BURT: There's no room for the college graduated! No room for people who watch public television. - No room for commitments! - Amen! C'mon! [PANTING] [FAINT GIGGLING] Ah! [GAGGING] VICKY: Here it is. - I wonder how it got here. - Not me. It looks like this one goes to Grand Island... and this one cuts up to the highway. Where's this Gatlin that we've been seeing the signs for? - It's not on here. - How come? It's gotta be. Look out! [TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMING] [SCREECHING CONTINUES] Hang on. Let me check. Let me check. - Where? Right there? - Yeah. It was just a bump. Just try to relax. That was an animal, right? I gotta go back there, okay Just stay here and try to rest. C'mon, buddy. Oh God! - Is he... - Oh yeah. [GASPING] - Oh God! - Easy, easy. C'mon. Easy. Don't look at him. Now listen to me. There's something very wrong here. So I want you to go back to the car and wait for me there. Understand? - And keep the doors locked. - Why? Where are you going? I'll tell you when I get back. Just do what I say. [BREATHING] Burt. Burt. Burt. Burt. I'm so sorry. [SCREAMS] - Vicky, c'mon. - Burt! - Easy. Calm down. - I kneeled down next to him. It's ok. Take it easy. Take it easy and relax. It's okay, understand? You're okay. JOBY: Me and Sarah were playing in our old house. We play there lots. Malachai said it was forbidden. But I think that's because nobody ever asked him to play. When I grow up, I'm gonna have all the money in the world. - Me too. - You can't. - Why not? - 'Cause I'm gonna have it. - I'll get it first. - Will not. - Will too. - Will not. - Will too. - Oh yeah? How? Seven. One, two, three, four, five, six... [COUGHS] seven. Alright! See? Two hundred dollars. Ah, ah, Joby! How much? - Thirteen thousand hundred dollars. - Thirteen thousand hundred dollars? Okay, two thousand. I thought so. One hundred, two hundred, three... I got a great idea. Let's pretend this guy is Isaac and we'll put him in jail. What if he gets to get out of jail with a free card? What card? [BOTH LAUGHING] You think it might've been some accident with farm equipment? Not like that. His throat was cut deliberately. He was already dead when he stumbled down the road. Whoever killed him, do you think he saw us? - I felt like we're being watched. - Possible. Blood starts to coagulate in four minutes. When I went to get the suitcase it was still fresh. - He could have been out there! - I couldn't just leave it there. What if it holds some sort of clue? - Let's open it. - No. Let's just get to a phone or a house or some place. JOBY: Malachai took us right to Isaac. He'd finally convinced him punishing us for being unbelievers. Up to them, we've been forgiven 'cause we were in the corn... the day that "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" made himself known. That bothered Malachai. He had a lot of problems. [FOOTSTEPS] I found these two in one of the old homes... ...they had a game, music... ...and this. They come already. You have the gift of sight. - This is a blessing, my child. MALACHAI: I've seen this car up on the road. Go to the old man. Make sure he tells them nothing. What about these two? Take them back where they were. But they had a game and music. They're forbidden. Question me not, Malachai. I act according to his will. [SARAH AND JOBY GRUNTING] It seems we are in the Moon. We haven't even seen a truck. We'll be in Gatlin soon. Do you think he lived there? We may never know that. I really thing we should open it. Okay. Let's see if we can get some news. [PREACHER SHOUTING] PREACHER: Only by the blood of the Lamb are we saved! I'm getting tired of that crap. What is it? - Jesus Christ! - Not in my Book. - It looks like primitive folk art. - I think it's repulsive. MAN: Sarge, bring the number six. Damn it! You better give me the eight. C'mon. We haven't got all day. [GRUNTING] Good boy. We'll have that transmission fixed in no time... then, we'll get on the radiator. Damn. This road is becoming a bloody highway. I think it's the third car in a month. We know what to do, don't we? [SIGHS] We better put that suitcase away. [BUZZING NOISE] I'll be right back. - Hi, we got a... - I ain't got no gas. - I don't need gas. - I ain't got no diesel. - You don't understand. I need... - If you don't buy gas... you can't use the rest room. - I need to use your phone. - Telephone? I ain't got no telephone. Sarge. [SARGE WHIMPERING] Sarge, you be still. You have to go to Hemingford. It's about 19 miles down there. - What about Gatlin? - There ain't nothing in Gatlin. [SARGE BARKING] What do you mean: "There ain't nothing in Gatlin."? Folks in Gatlin got religious. They don't like outsiders... and they probably won't have a phone there either. I'd like to stay here and talk, but I got a transmission to fix. If you get on that road you'll be in Hemingford in no time. - Right. - Sarge, sit! At ease! Thanks a lot. Sarge! Either that man is senile, or he's being out in the Sun for too long. [BARKS] Come back here. Sarge, get back here! [SARGE CONTINUES BARKING] You hear me? Come back here. Come out! That's an order. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Who is it? Is that you? What do you want? What are you doing there? Well, there really isn't that much stuff in here. Just kids' stuff. Clothes, matches, compass, pocket knife. - I don't get it. Camping stuff? - Yeah. Oh, great! This must be our day. In the last sign we saw Gatlin was 3 miles... - and pointed that way? - That's what I thought. - Did I miss a turn? - No, we've been going straight. Somebody's been messing with the signs. Hemingford is gotta be straight ahead. Must have been the wind. [WIND HOWLING] These latches ain't worth a damn. Blow over in a bad fart. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] I never told them nothing. I swear it. I kept our bargain just like always. Jesus Christ! Gatlin! What do they have? Amonopoly on road signs? What about Hemingford? For people who don't like visitors they sure do advertise enough. Over there. Of course, it's the wind. [GRUNTING] Why did you have to go after them, Sarge? Why, you bastards! You can't do this to me. [GRUNTS] I know you're in here. C'mon! C'mon! I can smell you, you stinky little skunks. C'mon! Murderers little devils! C'mon! [THUNDER RUMBLES] VICKY: What was that? - That probably was just my golf bag. - Are you sure? - What do you mean am I sure? [THUMPING RAPIDLY] God, this isn't even a road. - We'll never gotta get out of here. - We will too, now stop it. Sorry. - Just tell me where we are. - I don't know. [THUMPING STOPS] We're back where we started from. We never should have listen to that old fool. Hemingford is 19 miles, Gatlin is only 3. I don't care how much religious they've got. We're going there. Don't ever show up in my emergency room, buddy. Behold. A dream did come to me in the night. And the Lord show all to me. CHILDREN: Praise God! Praise the Lord. A time of tribulation has come. A test is at hand. - The final test. - What has the Lord commanded? In the dream... the Lord did come to me and he was a shape. It was He Who Walks Behind The Rows. And I did fall on my knees in terror and hide my eyes... unless the fierceness of His face struck me dead. He told me all that it since happened. He said: "Joseph has taken his things and fled this happy place... because the worship of me is no more upon him... so take you his life and spill his blood". - He did? - Yes. "But let not the flesh pollute the corn. - Cast him instead upon the road." - And so was done. Joseph, the betrayer, was cast out. And He Who Walks Behind the Rows did say... "I will send outlanders amongst you. A man and a woman. And these outlanders... will be unbelievers and profaners of the holy". - I thought Isaac never came here. - But he's always been here. Just like He Who Walks Behind The Rows. "And the man shall sorely test you... for He has great power. Even greater than that of the blue man. CHILDREN: The blue man! Yes, the blue man! And just as the blue man was offered upon to Him... - so shall be the unbelievers! MALACHAI: Make sacrifice unto Him. Bring the blood of the outlanders. ALL[CHANTING]: Praise God! Praise The Lord! Praise God! Praise The Lord! Praise God! Praise The Lord! Praise God! Praise The Lord! Praise God! Praise The Lord! [WHISPERS] Let's get out of here! Praise God! Praise The Lord! Praise God! Praise The Lord! It looks like a swinging place. I guess nobody told them we were coming. I hope not. I don't see anybody. Town Hall. Grocery store. Hansen's Cafe. It seems they got a phone. Unless a ghost is using it. - What is it with this corn? - You got me. [GRABS PHONE, COINS CLINKING, DIALING] Is dead. Just like everything else here. [RAT SQUEAKS] Yuck! - A rat. - Yeah. Just an ordinary coffee shop rat. Now can we get out of here, please? Wait a minute! Come back here! C'mon, Vicky. Hurry up. I don't wanna lose them. [TIRES SQUEALING] What are you gonna do if you catch them? Ask where we can get help. What else? They just got off that way. Damn! Where did they go? We're already in the car. Why wouldn't we just go to Hemingford? - That would take us 20 minutes. - We'd just found people. Yeah, three kids that tried to steal our car. There's something very strange about this town. [SIGHS] We'd be better off in a bigger town anyway. - The size of Seattle. VICKY: Yeah. - Over there! - What? - I just saw a door open and close. - I didn't see anything. - Let's check it out. - Why? I thought we were going. - Settle down. - Don't patronize me. I'm not patronizing you. I just wanna see if there's someone there. Hello? Hello? Anybody home? We've had an accident. We need to use your phone. Okay. Now can we go? - Burt, this is somebody's house. - I know. I just want to use a phone. BURT: Hello? Gross. I'll check out the back. I found the phone. Matches the decor. This is three years old. I don't understand what's going on here. Well, can we go? [THUMP] [WHISPERS] Burt! Hello? Anybody here? [STAIRS CREAKING] [KNOCKING] [BOTH GASP] [GUITAR PLAYING] [EXHALES] Don't be afraid. We didn't mean to scare you. Hi! - What's your name? - Sarah. Sarah! That's a beautiful name. - This is Burt and I'm Vicky. - Are you here alone, Sarah? Do you live here? You just come here to play? - Are your mommy and daddy around? - They're in the corn field. - What are they doing there? - All the grown ups are there. Are they working there or having a meeting? No. Isaac put them there. Who's Isaac? - Sweetheart, tell us who Isaac is. - Our leader. Leader of what? Everybody. Of course. VICKY: Listen, could you take us to Isaac? - Why not? SARAH: He's scary. It's very important we speak to some grown ups as soon as possible. - We're wasting our time, Vicky. - Give her a chance. I'm gonna go look at the Town Hall. Why? Because we have a murder to report... and we're walking in circles, wasting our time. - Maybe she can help. - Fine. You stay here with her. Things aren't happening fast. I'm gonna leave you the car. I won't be gone very long. If anybody comes, honk. Okay? Are we safe? Yes. It's weird here, but it's safe. I'll be back. So, it looks like it's just you and me. What were you doing here by yourself? Just playing records? Come on, you can tell me. Drawing. Drawing? - what's so secret about drawing? - I'm not supposed to. You're not supposed to draw? - Who says? Isaac? - Malachai. Malachai? Why don't you draw me a picture we won't tell Isaac... or Malachai or anybody? - How's that sound? - Okay. - How's it coming? - Fine. - What did you draw? - You. You did? Can I see? What is this? [STAIRS CREAK] Burt? Burt, is that you? Burt, is that you? VICKY: Somebody here? Who are you? What do you want? We want to give you peace. Seize her. BOY: Come on! Get her! [BANGING ON DOOR] Come out of there! [GRUNTING] VICKY: Burt! Burt! Burt! Burt! VICKY'S VOICE: Are we safe? BURT'S VOICE: Yes, it's weird here, but it's safe. VICKY: Help me! Where are you taking me? Help! Help! [SARAH CRYING] Vicky! Sarah, what happened here? What happened? Where's Vicky? You've gotta think. Think. What happened to her? Please! Does he speak to you, Isaac? He speaks to me always. But today he's displeased. He's displeased with you, Malachai. What have I done? Question him not in vain. Do you not know you sacrificed Joseph without an offering? And did you not spill the blood of the old man... when his oil and gasoline were still useful to us? We have our own fuel now from the corn. Sow not your pride, Malachai. We have not enough. Maybe he's displeased that we have not offered Him... - Sarah and Jobe. - Sarah has the gift of sight. She warned us of the coming of the interlopers. Question not my judgment, Malachai. I am the giver of his word. Go you and bring me the husband. We must offer them tonight when Amos leaves. Sarah, come on. Tell me what happened to her. Sarah, look at me! Think! - What? - Malachai. Who's Malachai? What do you mean? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? VICKY'S VOICE: Oh, my God! [BELL TOLLING] [ROARING] [CHEERING] [SCREAMING] KIDS[CHANTING]: Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

[BELL TOLLING] Now the blood of Amos will be shared. Stop it! Stop that! Hold the outlander! [ALL GRUNTING] What the hell is going on here? Are you crazy? What do you think you're doing? My passage. It's my birthday. You've got a pretty sick way of celebrating it, pal. Silence, interloper! Your presence profanes this holy place. - He will wreck with you. - Great. I don't know who He is. Maybe He'd like to discuss what's going on here with me. - It says it should be... - Amos! - It says it is written. GIRL: Speak no more to him! He is an unbeliever. Hurry, get Isaac! No! Wait! Bring Malachai. [ALL GASP] What do you mean: "As it's written?" Written where? What? In this? Are you rewriting the whole thing or the parts that suit your needs? [GRUNTING] - Back off! GIRL: Sit down! What do we have here? Nineteen, eighteen... What is this? - These people died so young! AMOS: Not died. We go to him the first night of our nineteenth year. Who the hell is him? He Who Walks Behind The Rows. GIRL 2: Malachai comes! [GRUNTS] GIRL: Seize him! [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Back off! [ALL SHOUTING] Seize him. Do not let him escape. [YELLING] - Let's go. Get him! - Where is he? Come on! There he is. Go get him! You! Go that way! [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] GIRL: I need your help! Come on! Come on, help me Help me! Outlander! Hey! He's here. GIRL: Got you this time. BURT: This isn't a game, you understand? Back off! Outlander! Go get him! [SHOUTING] Check the doors! Check the doors! You guys go back to the alley. You, over there. You two follow me. Shit! [BURT GRUNTS, MALACHAI GROANS] Damn it! [GROANS] BOY: Hey, mister! I know a place to hide. But we gotta hurry. - Who are you? - Jobe. Stop asking questions. Come on! Will you come on? Careful. Don't be a scared cat. - Come on. It's only me and Sarah. - Sarah? Yes, my sister. Isn't that nice? My dad built it... when the communists launched their first strike. I don't think it's the communists we have to worry about. Don't worry. Nobody knows about this place. It's secret. - Those guys are friends of yours? - No way! They listen to Isaac and Malachai. - Who are Isaac and Malachai? - Isaac started the whole thing. If he hadn't come, this would never have happened. When he was young, he was a preacher... so everybody believed him. They thought he had a great spirit. I thought he was weird. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] We must sacrifice them both tonight. Amos will satisfy Him. We need the woman. - She'll bring the man to us. - No. He must be taken without her. We cannot remove her from this place. It is holy. We'll bring the Lord two by using one. Do not blaspheme, Malachai. You know not the laws. He speaks them only to me. I think not, Isaac. You are the one who's lost favor with Him. He's a God of blood and sacrifice, not ceremonies. Sacrilege! Down on your knees, heretic! Shut your mouth, Isaac! You've grown proud far from us. He Who Walks Behind The Rows will decide your fate. Don't you sit there, seize him! Punish him, cut him down. I command you! I am the word and the giver of His laws. Disobedience to me is disobedience to Him. Do it now or your punishment will be a thousand times... a thousand deaths, each more horrible than the last. They're tired of your talk. I've showed them what I can do. Cut the woman down. Put Isaac in her place. We'll see how the Lord favors you. Dare not to blaspheme. He will punish you. The God of hell will devour you. All of you! No! No! No! No! When my dad wouldn't get up I ran from Hansen... to get Officer Hodgekiss. But it was too late. Why? What happened to him? He got away at that time. He went to the barn after he talked to the minister. Minister? - What happened to the minister? - Malachai. MALACHAI: Outlander! Outlander! Get over there. He's gonna come. Get over there. BOY: You come with me down this street. MALACHAI: Outlander! Outlander! We have your woman. She still lives. Outlander! Maybe you don't hear so well. [SCREAMING] Outlander! Her blood will spill unless you give yourself up. We won't wait much longer. The night is coming. Night is his time. Outlander! Come on! Come on! Come on, outlander! Come on! [FAINT ECHOING] Are you looking for that lady? - Yes, you know where she is? - They took her out to the clearing. - What clearing? Where? - In the corn field. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. I followed them, just like I followed you. Show me. - Okay. - Come on, let's go. Okay. Quiet. Come on. Follow me to the barn. Careful. I'm ready to celebrate my birthday. ISAAC: Malachai! He will not forgive you. None of you will be forgiven. All of you shall feel his wrath! We have a surprise for you, Amos. Isaac is gonna keep you company. I am the word and the giver of his laws. This is the end! JOBY[WHISPERING]: Come on. Come in through here. You can see everything from here. [CREAKING] Okay, you two... you stay here and wait for me. All right? But if anything happens to me... you get to Hemingford as fast as you can. You get on that road and don't get off it. Understand? JOBY: Uh-huh. Go past the irrigation pump. [IRRIGATION PUMP WHIRRING] [WIND HOWLING] AMOS: It's him. He's come for me. He's come for me. He's come to welcome me. CHILDREN: Go to him, Amos. I'm here, Lord. AMOS: I'm here, Lord. I'm ready. Take me now, Lord. Your will, Lord. My passage. [CHILDREN VOCALISING] [AMOS YELLS, CREATURE ROARING] ISAAC: I did as you commanded. I was good! I swear it. I did everything you wanted! No! No! Stop! [SHRIEKING] Vicky, come on, run to the barn! [GRUNTING] Get him! He hit Malachai! - Seize him. - Take that. Vicky, get out of here! Was it like that with your parents? Was it? Just because some suck proclaims himself a holy man... and says God commands? What kind of God tells children to kill their parents? Answer me that, buddy. Did you hear that before Isaac? Did you? I can't believe you're this blind. Maybe you've been listening to this holy roller so long... that all starts to sound the same. But it's not! Any religion without love and compassion is false. It's a lie! [MALACHAI YELLING] [YELLS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING AND YELLING] [GRUNTS] [GROANING] [PANTING] CHILD: Did he kill Malachai? Is this what you want? Is it what he commands? [KNIFE THUDS] I don't think so. Get him! Stop him! Kill him! ISAAC[IN DEMONIC MOICE]: Malachai! [CHILDREN GASPING] He wants you too, Malachai. He wants you too. [SNARLING] [NECK CRACKS] [THUNDER CRASHING] [CHILD CRIES] [SCREAMS] BURT: Vicky? - Burt? - Over here! VICKY: Burt! - Are you okay? - Yes. Get down. Joby, get some help and get those doors closed. Quick. JOBY: Rudolf, Robert, come on! VICKY: What do we do? BURT: I don't know. If I knew what it was, I could tell you. It's He Who Walks Behind The Rows. What if we tried to make it to the road? I think we're safer here, for now. [CRASHING] Joby, has anybody ever tried to hurt the monster? Any of the adults, your parents before they were killed? The Blue Man! Who is the Blue Man? What did he do? Officer Hodgekiss. I told you. He came down here after he talked to the minister. He was reading a page torn out from the Bible... and it was working with distil. [ALL SCREAM] What was he reading at the Bible? What was it? Do you know? You have it? Hurry up. Where is it? CHILD: It's all Malachai's fault! "And the devil that deceived them... was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur. Where the beast and the false prophet shall be tormented... day and night, for ever and ever." What's that supposed to mean? [BANG] Jobe, what was the Blue Man doing at the distil? He hooked the hose and he was trying to roll it out. - What stopped him? - Malachai. Lake of fire. Fire! He was gonna burn the field. Oh, yes. The alcohol from the distil. - How? - Never mind, never mind. Kids, you bring me as many hoses as you can find. Quick! Jobie and Sarah. Find me a bottle. A glass bottle. A pop bottle, alright. Quick! Move! Vicky, come here! CHILD 2: Over here! CHILD 3: I can't find anything. [CHILD SCREAMS] It doesn't fit. There's gotta be a connector here somewhere. Tty this. Get somebody to hold this on tight. - Okay. - Hang on to it. You got one. Good! Vicky, see if you can find me a thick rag. Joby, come here. Hey, this is not a rag. Get them to hold on that tight. Open it up when I get there. All right? All right. Be careful. I love you, Vicky. [WIND HOWLING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] Ow! Ow! [GRUNTING] [CREATURE MOANING] What are you doing here? Get back to the barn. Hurry up! Go on! Move! Now! Excuse me! Joby, get that valve. Quick. Joby, do you know how to run this thing? - Crank it! - What? Crank it. Push the button at the top. Yeah! [MOTOR PUMP WHIRRING] JOBY: Get the bottle. - Okay. BURT: Come here. Block the wind. [CRASHING] [GRUNTS] Joby! Joby, come back here! Joby! Run, come on, run! - Joby! - Here's the bottle! Throw it! Throw right this time! Throw it! Throw it! [EXPLOSION] [FAINT SCREAMING] [EXPLOSION] Burt! SARAH: Joby! Burt! SARAH: Joby! BURT: Vicky! JOBY: Sarah! SARAH: Joby! Joby! [CREATURE GROWLING] Look! [EXPLODING] Come on! Come on! Let's go! [DEMON SCREAMING] JOBY: Is he dead? BURT: I think so. Then why are we still running? - Just keep going! - Where did you get this guy? Hemingford is 19 miles, right? VICKY: We walk? - Sure. Are you sure you're strong enough? I'm okay. And you? Are you okay? I'll make it. I got a great doctor. [BOTH LAUGHING] Jealous? So what do we do with these two little kids? BURT: I don't know. You guys wanna stay with us for a couple of days? How about a week? [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Okay. - How about a month? - No. All right. All right. I'll grab the map. - Ever been to Seattle? SARAH: What's Seattle? - Interloper! No! - God! You must die! [GRUNTS] Oh, boy. She's out cold. What are we gonna do now? Send her a card from Seattle. Let's get out of here.
