PeG@SuS Urang Sunda Asli (triumphant music) (lighthearted music) (whimsical music) (cars honking) (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) - Yes, yeah, I finished it this morning before we left. I can't do that right now. We're about to leave. What? Sorry, I gotta go. George, wait up! I need you to stick close. (Curious George chattering) - [Announcer] Last call for boarding train 909! Last call! - George, we need to hurry. Pets are trained to cousin Ginny's farm. (Curious George screeching) The farm is gonna be a nice change of pace. Am I right, George? George? George? George? George? George. (knocking) - All aboard! (clears throat) Tickets, please. For you and your monkey. (lighthearted music) (train horn blowing) - Ah. Whew. Wow. (Curious George chattering) We made it. (Curious George chattering) George. How about we settle back and enjoy the ride, huh? What do you say? (Curious George chattering) George? Please sit down. This trip is all about relaxing and clearing the mind. (Curious George chattering) The only thing I plan to move is my arm when I cast my fishing line. (Curious George chattering) Ginny's farm is out in the countryside like that, George, but it's way out west. (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) * The wheels are rolling under your seat * * You feel that tingle start in your feet * * You know that something wonderful is coming your way * * You watch the world go thundering past * * Feel your heart start beating so fast * * There couldn't be a happier day than today * * The mountains so tall, the trees so green * * Like nothing at all you've ever seen * * You could reach right out to capture a cloud * * If you tried * Anything's possible under a wide * * Wide open sky (coyote howling) * And each new place that comes into view * * Is like a song that's singing to you * * Won't you come along and see what surprise lies in store * * And who can say what's round the next bend * * A stranger who might just be your friend * * New adventures that you've never imagined before * * Now you're racing along, mile after mile * * Sun overhead, bright as your smile * * And outside your window * Wonders are catching your eye * * Everything's magical under a wide * * Wide open sky * You could be riding your horse over the plains * * Running free, guiding the herd, holding the reins * * It's a whole new world * Here in the west * Every day is good, better, best * * And your dreams can come true * * If only you let them fly * Everything's wonderful under a wide * * Wide open sky * Wide open sky (horse whinnying) * Wide open sky (Curious George cheering) - You didn't tell me George was a cowpoke. - Ginny! It's been too long. - Hey, 'Cuz. Hi, George. Good to meet you. (Curious George chattering) Since when were you a fisherman? - I'm not... Yet. But I've been doing a lot of reading about it. - Oh, gotta start someplace. Well, George, are you ready to meet some new friends? (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (dog barking) (Curious George chattering) - That's Sadie, my collie. (dog barking) - What's she doing? - She's trying to make sure you two stay together and don't get lost. (dog barking) - Yes, ma'am. (lighthearted music) (dog barking) (chuckling) - Looks like George has made a friend. - You must be excited for your vacation. - Ugh, I'm a nervous wreck. I never left the farm for this long and the timing isn't ideal. - Then why take a trip now? - Ever since my mother retired, she's all about exploring new things and self-improvement. It's exhausting. I suppose I shouldn't complain. I won't mind little resort pampering, and room service. I just love room service. Oh, almost there! (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - [Ted] That's a lot of land to farm sit. - Oh, that's not my place. That's Frank Stetson's cattle ranch. My farm's down the road. Calm and peaceful. - Ah. (Curious George chattering) (yelling) (tires screeching) - Everybody okay? - I think so. - Come back here, you! (dramatic music) - Whoa, Nelly. - Nelly's always escaping her pan. (lamb bleating) That little lamb of mine is the most rambunctious critter I've ever seen. Except for maybe Emmett there. He's my new farmhand. Good kid. Just getting the hang of things. (lamb bleating) - Nelly! (Curious George chattering) - George! - It's all right. Emmett can use all the help he can get. - Whoa, Nelly. Whoa, Nelly. (dog barking) (lamb bleating) Hey! (suspenseful music) (dog barking) - Looks like you can use a hand there, Emmett. Ya! (dramatic music) (lamb bleating) (Curious George chattering) (lamb bleating) - Thanks, Frank. Guess Emmett needed some help. - Sure thing. - Glad you hired him. He's a good kid. Just not quite a full on cowboy yet. Well howdy, little fella. (Curious George chattering) - Frank. This is George, and that's my cousin, Ted. They'll be watching my place while I'm away. - Nice to meet you, (groaning) - Ted, if you need anything while Ginny's gone, shoot me a call. - Okay, thanks. - Ginny, George, Ted. Nice to meet you. Emmett. Ya! (horse whinnying) (suspenseful music) (Curious George chattering) - Oh, no, no. Being a cowboy is hard work, George. - Oh, psh. Easy as getting wet in a rainstorm. Catch you later, George. Whoa! (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - Here we are, home sweet home. (Curious George chattering) - George, come back here. We don't know that bull. This is not relaxing! (Curious George chattering) (bull whinnies) - Did that bull just whinny? - He sure did. I got Billy when he was just a calf, along with that plow. I could use his help plowin' my field. I was hoping Billy would pull it. But Billy took to Ricochet over there, and now, well... (animals whinnying) Billy thinks he's a horse. - Well, she sure is a good looking horse. - Ricochet is a retired trick horse. (Ricochet whinnying) There's showbiz in her blood, and I've got no idea what to do with her. (animals screeching) (Curious George chattering) (dog barking) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (cows mooing) (pigs oinking) (Curious George chattering) (llama gurgles) (Curious George chattering) That's Spittoon. (chuckling) - That's an odd name for a llama. (Spittoon spits) - Is it? Come on in the house, Ted. You can clean up while I fix dinner. - Okay. Come on, George. (Curious George chattering) - Oh, I'll keep an eye on him. (Curious George chattering) - Okay then. Be a good little monkey. - Hey, George. You want to help me feed Billy and Ricochet? (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Ricochet whinnying) (laughing) She's telling you she wants two carrots. (Curious George chattering) Ricochet is a smart horse, all right. But she is willful. (cow moos) (Curious George chattering) (cow moos) Look at that. You got a way with animals, George. (Curious George chattering) (donkeys hee-hawing) Oh, steady there, Frick and Frack. We haven't forgotten about ya. These two are stubborn. They'll do just about anything for a carrot. (Curious George chattering) Yeah. I really like these animals, and I've learned a thing or two here. But... (Curious George chattering) Well George, truth is someday I hope to work on a big cattle ranch like Frank Stetson's. (Curious George chattering) Yep. Ever since I was a kid, I've dreamed about being in the wide open spaces, herding cattle. (Curious George chattering) (wondrous music) - It's gonna be fine, Ginny. Just enjoy your vacation. - Oh, I forgot. Nelly likes hugs, and Spittoon doesn't like pizza. - Mhm. - And don't let Frick steal Frack's carrots. - I've got it covered, ma'am. (lighthearted music) - I hope you and George won't get bored. Things are pretty quiet around here. (chuckling) - Bored and quiet is exactly what I'm after. (lighthearted music) (engine revs) - Whew. - Bye! - Goodbye! - Have fun! (dog barking) (Ted snoring) (bell ringing) - Ah! (Curious George chattering) (bell ringing) (lighthearted music) - Good morning, sleepyheads. Thought I'd serve you breakfast out here in the fresh morning air. (Curious George chattering) - Looks like you're really pulled out all the stops, Emmett. - Aw, thanks, Ted. - Well, as long as I'm no longer sleeping, I think I'll head down to the river to catch some halibut for lunch. - Uh... Halibut don't live in the river. You're thinking trout, maybe? - Uh, yeah. That's exactly what I'm thinking. (lamb bleating) - Huh? (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) - Nelly, ugh! You got out of your pen again? (Curious George chattering) - Look out, fish. Here I come. (Curious George laughing) Well, George, you ready to catch some trout? (dog barking) (lamb bleating) - Hey! (Curious George chattering) (dog barking) - Okay, well, I'll be at the river. (grunting) - Whoa, Nelly. Whoa, Nelly. (lamb bleating) All right, it's all right, come on. (Curious George chattering) Lasso her? Uh, yeah, sure, sure. I'll just lasso her. (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) Hm. (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (dramatic music) (fence breaks) (lamb bleating) (lighthearted music) Dang it! - [Ted] Emmett? George? I can use a hand here! - Okay. I'll get him, you get her. (Curious George chattering) (lamb bleating) (dog barking) - Shh. (door creaks) (dog sniffs) (wondrous music) (Curious George chattering) (lamb bleating) (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - Whoa! (chuckling) (grunting) - I tried a back cast like the book said. - Just keep trying, Ted. You'll get the hang of it. (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (animals grunting) (Curious George chattering) (animals grunting) (wagon rocking) (dramatic music) (animals chattering) (suspenseful music) (Curious George chattering) - George? (dog barking) (suspenseful music) (pig oinking) (cow moos) (animals chattering) (suspenseful music) - George, are you okay? (Curious George chattering) Ginny's animals are getting away. What do we do? - We'll just ride out there quick and round them up, that's what we'll do. (Curious George chattering) - But we don't ride. - Don't have to. Frick and Frack can pull the chuckwagon here and you two can ride on it. - Maybe we should call Frank Stetson. - Come on, Ted. If we leave now, we'll be back by supper. (Curious George chattering) (animals chattering) (dog whimpers) - (sighs) Okay. Let's get this done. - Yee-haw! (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) * When trouble comes a knock, knock, knockin' at your door * * Kickin' up a flurry and a fuss * * And you're not quite sure what you ought to do * * Don't thank you, thank us * One head's good, two is better * * But when you put three heads together * * You can bet everything will turn out fine * * And you'll be home by supper, suppertime * * So what if something seems impossible to do * * That don't mean it can't be done * * And when your partners come a ridin' to your side * * That makes it much more fun * One head's good, two is better * * But when you put three heads together * * You can bet everything will turn out fine * * And you'll be home by supper, suppertime * * Round them up, all of your troubles * * Watch them pop like a bunch of bubbles * * Round them, watch them disappear * * And they will blow away from here * * Round them up (dramatic music) - They vanished. Oh, man. - Aw! - Don't give up, you two! All we gotta do is track 'em. Just find their tracks and follow 'em. - In loop-the-loops? - Don't worry about me and Ricochet. Right, girl? (animals whinnying) Now let's do some tracking. (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) These are Spittoon's tracks for sure. (Curious George chattering) Llamas don't have hooves, they have feet with two toes. And those are sheep tracks, and pig tracks, and oh, those are cows. (Curious George chattering) Yup, you've been here too, George. - That's gotta be our animals, right? - Mhm. Now all we gotta do is follow the tracks. Uh oh, oh boy. (whimsical music) (Curious George laughing) (bird screeching) (serious western music) - It's been hours. We haven't found one single animal. - Yeah, well I lost the tracks a ways back. - What? - It's just the ground's hard and dry, that's why. - So we've lost Ginny's animals? - Come on now. Cowboys don't quit. When the going gets tough, we get tougher. (Curious George chattering) This looks like a good spot to stop for lunch. What do you say? - How can you think of food at a time like this? We don't relax until we find Ginny's animals. - Ted, our animals need food and water, and so do we. Besides, they won't run forever. They'll stop and eat too. (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) Hey, I found this map in the chuckwagon. We can see where the animals might have gone. (lighthearted music) - This looks as ancient as the wagon. - Yup. Old but useful. See, here we are at... Bison Boulder. I figure the animals are heading for Jewel Lake. Here. - How do you know that? - Well... They're bound to be thirsty. (Curious George sighs) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (animal squealing) (Curious George chattering) * Sometimes someone quite surprising * * Will appear on your horizon * Open up your eyes and be ready on your feet * * Stay calm and stay collected * When you face the unexpected * You never really know what kind of friends you'll meet * * Uh oh, you never know * Just what's coming around the bend * * Uh oh, I'm telling you so * It might be trouble * Or it might be a friend - Hey, where's my hat? - Maybe you left it in the wagon. * There are friends you want to play with * * Maybe even run with * Spend a happy day with * 'Cause they seem so neat * They are funny and they're smiley * * But they're tricky and they're wily * * And highly unpredictably, those friends you'll meet * * Uh oh, look out below * Who is that racing around the bend * * Uh oh, and you get up and go * You might find trouble or you might find a friend * * Some friends you know you can count on * * Some friends you always can rely on * * But then you meet a certain someone * * Uh oh, you gotta keep an eye on * (animal squealing) * Now when all is said and done * * And you've had your share of fun * * You find that you're the lucky one * * Who's in the catbird seat * You might've made a friend * Maybe someone to depend on * And you share a happy ending * With the friends you meet * Uh oh, now you know * You're ready for whatever's coming round the bend * * Uh oh, told you so * The crazy kind of trouble * Crazy kind of friend (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - This is definitely a herd. Looks like they're heading north, across Copper Creek Bridge to.... Just as I figured! Jewel Lake. (Curious George chattering) - Hm? Hm. (motorcycle revving) (lighthearted music) - Didn't the the resort have a shuttle? - I rented this. Much more fun, right? And we're not staying at a resort. - Then where are we staying? (lighthearted music) Huh? - Welcome to paradise. - Does paradise come with room service? (lighthearted music) (inspiring western music) (Emmett yodeling) (Curious George chattering) - I was yodeling. Long ago, cowboys used to yodel to calm their herd. Thought I'd give it a try. Could come in handy later. (Curious George chattering) (Emmett yodeling) (birds cawing) A ha, Copper Creek Bridge! Just like the map said. - Whoa, wait a minute. You expect us to cross that rickety thing? - We gotta, Ted. It's the way the animals went. (Curious George chattering) Come on, girl. (Ricochet whinnying) - See? I'm not the only one who doesn't want to cross that thing. (Curious George chattering) George. (dog barking) George, be careful. (dog grunting) (tense music) - Ah, see? This isn't so bad. You're doing a good job, George. (Curious George chattering) How's it going back there, Ted? - [Ted] Just enjoying the view. (laughing) - Told you it was stronger than it looked. Jewel Lake, here we come! Let's go round up some animals, ya! (lighthearted western music) (lighthearted tropical music) - If you want to see the fish, you have to put your head under. - I don't want to see what's down there. The only place I like to see fish is on my dinner plate. - Hey! Where'd you go? - Oh, a giant sea turtle! - Where? (spitting) (chuckling) - It's easier to breathe with a snorkel in your mouth. (lighthearted tropical music) - And where are the animals? - Well, they've been here. (Curious George chattering) - We're out of our league, guys. I'm calling Frank Stetson. (Curious George chattering) Because we need him to round up Ginny's animals. - But Ted- - This is not up for discussion. This is, this is... Not going to happen. I don't have a signal. Fine, we'll just go back and ask him. - But that's a five hour ride at least. But we'll be riding in the dark before long. (Curious George chattering) And we'd have to cross that bridge again. - We made it once, we can do it again. - You're just tired, Ted. How about we camp for the night? We'll relax, get some rest, and make a fresh start in the morning. (Curious George chattering) - Well, where will we sleep? What will we eat? - I may have packed a few extra things. - You what? - You can never be too prepared, Ted. And you know, that lake is chock full of trout waiting to be caught. (Curious George chattering) - I don't know. Maybe I've had enough fishing. (Curious George chattering) - Yeah! If I can teach you to catch a fish, then we spend the night, deal? - Oh, deal. (Curious George chattering) - Okay. See that rock in those reeds? - Yeah. - That's where the fish will be hanging out, looking for food. Keep your wrist nice and loose, and whip the tip of the rod up and back, and flick the rod forward now! - Oh, rats! (water splashing) - Try it again. (lighthearted music) - Ugh, this isn't working. (water splashing) - Third time's a charm. (tense music) (Curious George chattering) Good going! Now gently twitch the line, it makes it seem like the lure's alive. - Hey, I caught one! - Yank it back a touch. Oh, not too hard. That's it, now reel 'er in. Okay, good! George, grab that net and scoop her up! (Curious George chattering) - Oh, I did it! - So, looks like we're spending the night? - Yep. A deal's a deal. But this time I'll do the cooking. (Curious George chattering) Ooh. I think I can work with this. (lighthearted music) - Ooh! (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) - Nice roping! (Curious George chattering) Truth is, I haven't had much hands-on roping experience. (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (tense music) PeG@SuS Urang Sunda Asli (bell ringing) - [Ted] Dinner is served! (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - Oh, Ted, that fish was... (Curious George chattering) I second that. Mm, mm, good. - Thanks. I found a little sage growing nearby. (lighthearted music) Wow. I have never seen so many stars. - Whoa. - A good ol' cowboy campfire requires a good ol' cowboy song. (lighthearted music) * Now the sun is sinking low * And you're moving kind of slow * * The evening breeze is blowing through the willow trees * * As the stars begin to peep, you're falling off to sleep * * You never knew you'd maybe find * * Some friends like these * Whoa, whoa, you never know * Just what's waiting around the bend * * Whoa, whoa, what do you know * You went looking for trouble * But found a friend * Yodel odel odel lay tee * You found a crazy kind of friend * * Yodel odel odel lay tee * Oh, you found yourself a friend * (harmonica music) (Curious George chattering) Sure, give it a go. (Curious George playing harmonica) Hey, with a little practice, you'll get the hang of it. (Curious George chattering) You know, for a little monkey, you sure know a lot. (Curious George chattering) (harmonica music) (lighthearted music) (suspenseful music) Dang it! (suspenseful music) - Huh? (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Curious George laughing) (wind blowing) (harmonica music) - Good morning, George. (Curious George chattering) (harmonica music) (humming) Ah. (Ted yodeling) (dog whimpering) - Try it like this, Ted. (Emmett yodeling) (lighthearted music) (Emmett yelling) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! (groaning) That ought to do it, I guess. (groans) Ow. Well, Ted, looks like you'll be riding Ricochet while I rest my rump on a nice, soft pillow in the wagon. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I have never ridden a horse, except on a merry-go-round. - Then you've already got a head start. (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) (Ted yelping) You're doing great! (Ted yelping) - Easy, easy! Easy, easy, easy! How do I take her out of reverse? - Let her know who's in charge! - She is! - Put your feet in the stirrups! (lighthearted music) Okay, loosen up on the reins. Use your legs. (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) That's how you do it! (lighthearted music) - Home sweet home, here we come. - What? - Come on, guys. We need help finding those animals. We got to go back and get Frank Stetson. - We don't need Frank Stetson's help, Ted. I'm certain our animals are in Fernwood Forest. It's just around that bend. (bird screeches) - How can you be sure they're there? There's lots to eat, and they'll love the shade. Ted, just give me one more chance. - Okay. - You won't regret this. (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - I hope you're right. Oh, to be in Ginny's shoes. - I'll never forgive you for this! (lighthearted music) (Ginny grunting) Oh my goodness. (wondrous music) - Well honey, we should probably head back. It'll be dark soon. - I think I need to rest my feet before we start hiking down. - Oh, we're not hiking down. - We're not? (Ginny screaming) (suspenseful music) (Ted grunting) - I still don't see any animals. (harmonica music) (lighthearted western music) Emmett, face it, you have no clue where these animals are. - Well... (dog barking) I know they can't be far. - [Ted] I've been listening to you all this time, enough is enough. (dog barking) (lighthearted music) (Curious George chattering) (dog barking) - The animals are... (lamb bleating) Nelly! (Curious George chattering) Ted, don't lose her! She could lead us to the herd. - Okay. (lamb bleating) (Curious George chattering) Do you see her, George? (yelling) (water splashes) Oh, George, we lost her. We're never gonna find these animals. (lighthearted music) Go! (lighthearted music) Well, what do you know? Nelly must've been trying to lead us to her momma. (Curious George chattering) (animals chattering) - Way to go, fellas! You found the herd! (Curious George chattering) Oh yeah, we don't have Spittoon. - He's gotta be close by. (thunder rumbling) (animals chattering) Oh no, no, no, no, no. I don't like this one bit. We need to get everyone to some shelter. (dramatic music) (Curious George chattering) - Lone Pine Falls, that's an old ghost town. We don't want to go there. I heard it's so chock full of ghosts, the folks that lived there up and deserted the place. (Curious George chattering) - George, ghost town is just an expression for a town that's abandoned. There's no such thing as ghosts. Isn't that right, Emmett? (tense music) (chuckling) - That's right. Oh, good gravy. (thunder rumbling) (animals chattering) - There it is. Lone Pine Falls. (thunder rumbling) (animals chattering) Hey, Emmett! These animals look scared. - Yeah. They could stampede straight through town and out the other side. - Stampede? - Okay. If you can hold them up here, I'll block off Main Street. Then you drive them down, and we'll pen them in. (thunder rumbling) (animals chattering) You gotta get in front of them and turn them back towards town! (Curious George chattering) I meant for you to do it, Ted. - I know! George, wait, I'll do it! (suspenseful music) (animals chattering) Hey, slow down! (Curious George chattering) Whoa! (Curious George chattering) - Okay, no such thing as ghosts, nothing to be scared of. Except that. Hold tight, Frick and Frack. (herd rumbling) Stop! (animals chattering) - Where will we hold the herd? (Curious George chattering) - Good idea! (Curious George chattering) (animals chattering) (lighthearted music) (cow moos) (lamb bleats) - Everyone accounted for? (Curious George chattering) - George, here's what we'll do. Tomorrow at first light, we'll track down Spittoon. Absolutely. Then we can lead the whole herd back to Ginny's. - You've got to be kidding me. After what we just went through, we're not taking these animals anywhere. - But- - No. George and the animals were in serious danger back there. We all were. I am not letting that happen again. (Curious George chattering) I'm trying to call Frank Stetson so he can get us out of this mess once and for all. Still no signal, ugh! Hm. I wonder... It works! (Curious George chattering) No, we can't do it. George, I'm not a cowboy, Emmett's not a cowboy, and neither are you. - Ted's right, George. This whole round up idea was my fault. (phone ringing) - [Frank] Hey, you've reached Frank Stetson. Leave a message after the beep, ya! - Hi, Frank. This is Ted, Ginny's cousin. Long story, but we're stuck in Lone Pine Falls with all Ginny's animals. You'd be doing me a huge favor if you could meet us out here and bring them back for us. Thanks. George. I... (Curious George chattering) (melancholic music) (rain falling) (thunder rumbling) (snoring) (jarring piano music) - What was that? George, did you hear that? That! (wind blowing) (jarring piano music) (Curious George chattering) No, that's okay we don't have to find out what it... Wait for me! (lighthearted piano music) Oh, oh goody! A musical ghost. Buh-bye. (mysterious music) (jarring piano music) (Curious George chattering) Twisted tumbleweeds! A ghost! A real life ghost! (Curious George chattering) Spittoon! (lighthearted piano music) An old player piano. Told you where was nothing to be scared of. (Curious George chattering) (rain pouring) (calming music) - Now this is more like it. Hm? Hey guys, Spittoon is back! (lighthearted music) Guys. I know you're disappointed I called Frank. - Hmph. - Hmph. (lighthearted music) - Well, guess I'll go back to reading this book I found on the history of Lone Pine Falls. Contrary to popular folklore, the town wasn't abandoned because of ghosts. Well, what do you know? No ghosts. - Well, what made all the people leave then? (Curious George chattering) - It says a tremendous storm caused a flash flood to come hurdling down Main Street. Fortunately, no one perished. (thunder rumbles) Huge storm, flash flood, down Main Street? We need to get to higher ground, now! (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbling) - She's making a break! - Ya! Get back in there, come on, ya! George, head up that trail. Oh, no. (suspenseful music) - It'll be all right, Nelly girl. I hope. (animals chattering) (suspenseful music) I'm stuck! I'm stuck! (dramatic music) Thanks. - You got it. (lighthearted music) (animals chattering) (water rushing) - Whew, oh boy. Ted. You really saved the day back there. - Thanks. (animals chattering) - Emmett. Where's the map? We're going home. - But Ted... - Aren't we gonna wait for the Stetson crew to show up? - Let's meet them on the way back. I say we can do this ourselves. (lighthearted music) - Well, what do you know? (lighthearted music) We're here, and here's Ginny's farm. (Curious George chattering) Looks like a river. - Uh, how big? (dramatic music) This'll have to do. Ready, George? Emmett? - I don't know. - What's wrong? - I've only seen someone ford a river in the movies. It feels a whole lot different in real life. Truth is, I've never done any of this before. I've never herded cattle, never roped anything. I'm just a big dreamer phony baloney. (Curious George chattering) - George is right, Emmett. You were the one who tracked the herd. (Curious George chattering) And you taught me how to fish and how to ride. Without your cowboy skills, we would've never made it this far. (Curious George chattering) Besides, when the going gets tough, we get tougher, right? (bird screeches) - If you two believe in me, then it's high time I believe in myself. Let's ford this thing! (Curious George chattering) - Emmett, it's time I take the wagon, and you ride Ricochet. (dramatic music) - Ted, you start the wagon across. (dramatic music) - Oh, okay, that's deep. - George, you and Billy go next. The animals will follow Billy. Me and Ricochet, we'll bring up the rear. (Curious George chattering) (Billy muttering) (animals chattering) - What's going on back there? - Billy's not going in. If doesn't lead the herd across, we're stuck. (animals chattering) (Curious George chattering) (Emmett yodels) (Ted yodels) (lighthearted music) * When the road's getting rough and the river's too wide * * When you know in your heart it's time to decide * * Will you stand on the shore or mount up and ride * * Will you make it * Make it to the other side (lamb bleats) * When you're over your head * And your mind's full of doubt * * And wherever you look, there's no easy way out * * Gotta dig way down deep to the courage inside * * It will get you, get you to the other side * (Curious George chattering) * Look all around you * You know what you'll find * You are never alone * Someone's riding behind * So lift up your voice * And say it with pride * We can make it * We can make it to the other side * * You and me, we can make it (dog barking) * We're gonna make it to the other side * (animals chattering) - We did it! Yee haw! - Yee haw! (Curious George chattering) - [Frank] Everyone okay here? - Frank! (lighthearted music) - You got my message? - You called? We've been out checking our fences since last night when the storm broke. I say, Emmett, that was mighty fine ropin'. You showed some real courage out there. If you still want that job at my ranch, it's all yours. (lighthearted music) - No thanks, Frank. I'm happy working on Ginny's farm. (animals squealing) - How about we get these animals home? (Curious George chattering) (lighthearted music) - No, no, it's fine, Mom. Actually, I was thinking next time we could try some mountain climbing. Mount Everest? Hm. (lighthearted music) Well, look at that. Everyone's behaving themselves. (lighthearted music) I can't believe it! Billy's pulling that plow. (dog barking) - Ginny! (Curious George chattering) - Hey guys! - Welcome home, boss. How was your trip? - Well, remember how I was saying I'm the stay at home type? Not anymore. This is my favorite place on earth, but there's so much more out there to see and do. (chuckling) - I know what you mean. - Did you finally get to relax, Ted? - I've found a better way to clear my mind. (Curious George chattering) What George is trying to say is, we got to spend time with a real cowboy. - Emmett, looks like you did a great job. I picked this up for you. - Thanks! (guitar music) - Are you free next summer to watch the place? Mom and I are thinking about Paris, or Mount Everest. - You bet!
