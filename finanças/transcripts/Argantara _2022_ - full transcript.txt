This is not just my story. This is his story. A story about him. A guy that I hated. His name is Argantara. Leader of Agberos. A gang that has long been rivals with another gang named Baron. There is no end to their fights. Aska! Blood for blood. A life for a life. Destruction for destruction. They put their lives on the line. And they never stop, not even when blood is spilled. Argantara's dark life... ...is completely different compared to other teenagers. A polar opposite of mine. Syera, hurry. You're going to be late. Yes, Mom! I have a happy family. - Mom. - Yes. - See you later. - Take care, sweetie. Okay. Ready? Yes, Dad. Bye-bye! The 2022 Best Student of Jakarta... ...is awarded to... ...Syera Jehani from Merpati High School. My bright future is ahead of me. And I have great friends. - Syera! - Hi! You're being suspicious. Did you do the homework? Do you want to copy it? You know how I am with Physics. I just feel like healing. - Get it? - I know. Wait. What's the problem? Ugh. Bad boys with so many fans. Their future is bleak. What is there to see? Listen up. The female reproductive organ is called the uterus. We can also refer to it as the womb. The function of a uterus... ...is to keep the ova or eggs until it is fertilized… My womb feels all warm when I look at Aldi. He's handsome. Captain of the basketball team. Hey. Since he was the vice president of the student council, until he became the president, everyone knows that he likes you. It's pretty obvious that he likes you. So far, do you understand? Yes, Ma'am. Who do you think, would have their eggs fertilized by Aldi? What's that, Ghea? - Eggs fertilized by who? - No, nothing, Ma'am. Alright, that's enough! I never do it before! Want a virginity check? Let's do it. It's nothing, Ma'am. I want it! Quit it! Kids, let me remind you. Do avoid sexual relations before marriage. Alright? It makes me want to get married soon. Don't married at young age either... ...getting married just so you can have sex is also wrong. You really need to think of, the consequences and the responsibilities. Don't forget to do your homework at home, and I'll see you next week, okay? Yes, Ma'am. Syera. I saw Mrs. Beti during the break, she said she wanted to see you after school. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. By the way… ...no, never mind. Sorry. What? That's it? What is this? Yesterday I found them in your desk. You've broken so many rules at school. The rule states you should wear black shoes. And you're here wearing red. Why don't you just use glass shoes like Cinderella? - Excuse me. - Come in, Syera. - You wanted to see me? - Yes. Yes. Hey. I'm supposed to answer. Not you. I have a task for you. You need to keep an eye on Arga, while he does his punishment. Do I really have to do it again? - I'm no longer part of the student council. - Yes, yes. I know you're no longer vice president. But I only trust you. So what do we do here? Get it together! If you keep doing it that way, when will you be done? You need to gather all the leaves, bring them over there. Burn them in the dump. Remember. Don't burn them in… Arga! Are you listening to me? - Gosh. - Huh? Hey, Arga. Where are you going? You're not done yet. The broom… ...this is a school! Okay. Since you're messing with me… ...Argantara Reynand. Refuses to do the punishment. Makes a mess of the leaves. - Smokes at school and... - Enough, don't write that. No. I'm telling Mrs. Beti. Alright, I'll clean it up. Do it properly. People used to say... ...if you don't sweep neatly, your wife will have a beard. What if you end up becoming my wife? No way! Even if the mountains turn to boxes, I will never be your wife! Ugh, so annoying. Now I'm home late. How do we tell Syera? We can't put it off again. We've been putting off telling her all this time. Dad, Mom. What is this about? Why everyone silent? What is going on? Syera. Do you remember that I used to have a friend named Anjar? Hmm, no. Why? Uncle Anjar is my close friend. He once saved my life. I felt like I owed him, so I proposed something. He said no at first. But then he fell sick. Eventually, he died. Before he died, Uncle Anjar had one request. I said yes to it. We even have it on written form. It's a mutual agreement, almost like a contract. I promised to marry you to his son, when his son turns seventeen. That means now. His son is seventeen now, right? Marry? Syera, I know you're shocked. Syera sweetie, - I'm actually against this plan. - Honey? Darling, what kind of mother would do this? If it weren't for him, I would be dead. - I owe him my life. - That's enough. It has happened. There is nothing we can do. It's your decision now. - What do you want to do? - I don't want to get married. I'm still sixteen. Why would I? Besides, based on the law the legal age to get married is nineteen. - They revised it. - I know. You can get a marriage dispensation from the court. That way you can get married as long as the other terms are fulfilled. Come to dinner tonight, okay? We'll meet your future husband, his mother, and his mother's husband. No. Syera. Syera, sweetie. Syera. Let's go. Come on now. - Welcome. - Hi Ardi, Sonia. - How are you? - Good. - Hello. - Hi, how are you? - How are you? - Syera, say hi. - Meet Uncle Ardi and Auntie Sonya. - Hi, Syera. Syera, you're all grown up now. So beautiful. Thank you for coming. - Let's sit down. - Come on. - Where's your son? - He went to the restrooms. - Let's just sit. - Be my guest. So how is it going? - All good? - Yes, everything is well. How about you? There's Arga. Arga, meet Syera. Syera, this is Arga. Why are you both silent? You go to the same school, right? Arga said that Syera once supervised his detention. Yes. Have a seat, sweetie. Please help yourselves. Bon appetit. Eat up. Syera, help yourself. Eat a lot, Arga. Yes, Mom. So, what will happen to our kids? I personally think... ...that arranged marriages at a young age... ...does not seem to work in this era. It seems irrelevant. But since it's a promise. I'll let the kids decide. Syera, what do you think? I'm sorry. For me, I don't think I can fulfill the promise to Uncle Anjar. What about you, Arga? Arga? I bet Arga thinks the same. I'm sure. - Arga will oppose. - I want to do it. Are you serious? Marriage, right? I'm up for it. The sooner, the better. Let's do it tomorrow, even. Huh? What? Arga. Yes? I need to talk to you. Since when were you aware about this arranged marriage? Why didn't you tell me? If I told you, would you have believed me? But why are you agreeing to it? If you're trying to mess with me, this is not it. See. You're crazy. Now go and tell your parents that you don't want this. No. Arga! Arga, we hate each other! You and I are like the sky and the land. We don't match. I just want to become a devoted son for my late father. To honor his last wish. You're saying that even you don't like me, you would still marry me, to honor him? Yes. Why? It doesn't make any sense. Everything makes sense if it's for your parents. Maybe you don't get it now. But one day you will. Don't let yourself... ...as a daughter... ...regret it one day. Hello, Mom? - Syera. - Mom. What happened? What did the doctor say? Hypertension. But he's okay now. He just needs to stay here for a couple of days. How did it happen? Because of his kidney. Syera, you don't know this. This whole time, your dad... ...has been living with only one functioning kidney. When you were little, he became really sick. Luckily, he found a donor. It was the late Uncle Anjar. Arga's father. Uncle Anjar then lived with one kidney. He eventually became ill too with kidney failure, and… ...well, because it was his only kidney… ...maybe it would be a different story. If Uncle Anjar never gave his kidney to your father. Syera. About you and Arga. Your father and I will let you decide. It's your life. You run it. Okay, sweetie? This ring was made after the agreement between Uncle Anjar and your father. It binds you to Arga. Look at it. You see Arga's name, right? Your name is engraved in Arga's ring too. - Mom. - Yes? I have one request. What is it? Please. Keep this marriage a secret. Especially from school. If they find out, I'll be expelled. Of course, sweetie. Your father and I understand. Don't you worry. We're living together? We're married. I thought we're staying at your parents' house? That's what they want. This is what I want. We can be independent. Besides, my late father left this house to me. Unbelievable. How are we supposed to live together? What? Arga! That hurts! You talk too much. You're annoying. Fine, but I'm getting my own room. Why can't we share? Hmm? Are you scared... ...of getting pregnant? Ugh. What are you doing? I'll keep this. To keep it a secret. Hmm. Right, keep it. So… What are you doing? Your hair looks nice. - What? - Your hair looks nice. Huh? Like Jarjit. So annoying! Welcome to my house. Where's my bedroom? Yours is upstairs. Mine is down here. The water doesn't work upstairs, if you wanna shower, do it with me. Arga! You pervert! Hey, stop. Stop! Arga, that's mine! - Whose is this? - Mine. You're my wife. And I'm your husband. Husband and wife... ...should share. Can you cook something for me? I'll be waiting. Gosh. I'm so tired. How is it? Good? It's bland. I saw blood too. Are you sure it's cooked? Have you done mopping? - Yes. - Did you do the laundry? - Yes. - Vacuum? - Yes! - Alright, then can you wash my bike? It's so dirty. Oh my God! What are you doing here? The aircon in my bedroom is off. - And? - Can I sleep here? No! - Go back to your room. - No! - Go! - No. - Stop. - It's too hot! Get up and go back to your room! Arga! Syera. Let's do it. Take that! Oh my God! Gosh. This is the first time in my life that I'm getting a punishment. First time I went to school without showering. And I'm late. My reputation is ruined. Why didn't you wake me up? I was too tired, babe. Who are you calling babe? I swear. Living together with you is like hell on earth. Really? Yes. Imagine. I do everything as a wife. It's our house, our life. We should be working as a team. I'm not having this. It's better than you. You think everything I do is wrong. It is wrong. Nothing you do is right. You can't even sweep properly. You can't mop right. You can't tell the difference between sugar and salt. And you burned the food. I really don't get men in this age. Are you done nagging? Think of our poor baby. You don't want a miscarriage. Arga! Stop saying things like that. What are you doing? Put your hand down. Why is he not home yet? Read this. Love, mom. Becoming a good wife. Seriously. Why would Mom send me this? How to be a good wife. Arga. Why are you home so late? Look at the time. Where have you been? Are you okay? What is it, Syera? Are you here to nag again? Can you do it later? I can't argue with you today. I'm so tired. I just want to sleep. Let me see. It seems like you're never going to stop, unless you're really beaten up. The Baron kids attacked Agberos. - I had to fight back. - Why? Just leave them be. Don't fight back. No need to. It didn't just happen once, Syera. It's been going on and on. Get up, you little shit! This time, their leader came. Bara, and his right hand Panji. I wanted to talk. But it turns out they did it to get me to come out. They wanted me to fight. The Baron members hate me. They want me destroyed. They want Agberos destroyed. They don't want Agberos to have more power. They want Baron to be number one. Seriously, Arga. This gang stuff is useless. Nothing good comes out of it. It's not that easy, Syera. Everything changed when my dad died. My whole life changed. Arga, sweetie. Where are you going? I made you breakfast. Come eat with me. My mom married Mr. Ardi. At first, I couldn't live with it. Arga. Arga. The only place I felt comfortable... ...was with my friends. We all loved motorbikes. And we ended up forming our own gang called Agberos. Arga! Arga! Arga! Until that one night... There's this one race that the Baron members always win. I beat Bara. Arga! Arga! Arga! From then on, the Baron members kept attacking Agberos. They attack, we retaliate. We never plan on admitting defeat. Until that fateful night happened. It was a huge brawl. Elang! Aska! Aska. My best friend was killed by Bara's men. We didn't have proof, but we all know it was him. Aska was like a brother to me. Hey. Oh. What is it? Does it hurt? It still hurts. Can I have a look? Is this… ...a real tattoo? What are you doing? I'm tired. I just want to rest. Just for a while. Can I? Syera. Yes? Your heart is beating really fast. Ouch! Are you nervous around me? - Here. - I'll return it tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye! Bye. Arga! You're coming to the base camp, right? Uh, not right now. I have extra classes to take. - You serious? - Yeah. - But you will come? - Yeah, just go ahead without me. - Alright, we'll be waiting! - Okay. Syera! Are you done with Mr. Ridwan's assignment? - Not yet. - Me neither. Let's do it tomorrow. We can go to the newly opened coffee shop nearby. I'll take you home after. Cancel it. Still on for tonight, right? I'll take you home. No. - I can't do that to Aldi. - Cancel it. I can't do it! If you go with him, how are you going to get home? To our house? You want him to find out about our marriage? I can ask him to take me to my parents' house. Did you read the book your mother gave you? Did you? Chapter 41 says that we need to limit our relationships. Besides, Aldi is my stepbrother. He's my stepfather's son. You're lying. Aldi is different. When his father married my mother, Aldi hated it. He called my mother names. I was hurt. I didn't like it. Aldi? I need to talk to you, Son. I transferred the money for this month. I know you're inside, Aldi. It doesn't seem right that you're living in your late mother's apartment. Auntie Sonia made you your favorite food. I'll put it in front of the door, okay? Aldi, sorry I can't make it. Hey, bro. Do you have extra classes again? What's going on with you? You're going to repent now? It's a girl, bet. Syera! Hi, Aldi. Are you going home? I think so. Why? Are you done with the assignment? Yes. Sorry about yesterday. Why are you two so awkward? No, we're going to the mall. Do you wanna come? No, only she is going. We both are. Wanna come? Hey, my helmet. We're gonna hang out. Wanna come? Let's go, babe. Huh? Babe? I'll take you home. Syera? Syera! Syera. Syera! Are you pretending you don’t hear me? Come on, babe. Stop calling me babe. People will get suspicious. They would probably think we're dating, nothing else. No. I don't want to. Fine, if you don't want to. To become a good wife, in chapter 1 it says... ...you have to listen to your husband. Chapter 5, if you don't listen to your husband... ...it's a sin. Are you okay with it? Okay. Fine. Damn! Not bad, Arga. - Hey! - Hello. Do you know about Syera and Arga? Are they close? No. They must be dating. They keep stealing glances. Maybe they've even done it. -Ghe. -Hey, Jo. - Jo, that's mine. - Ghe. - My helmet! - Want me to take you home? Stop calling me Ghe. Do you think I'm gay? Ouch. Arga! Hold on. Or you'll fall. Syera. I need your help. I have to get good grades. So I can graduate with good grades. Once I graduate, and enter a university, I can then get a job to support you. I want to become a husband you're proud of. What are you doing after this? Watch a K-drama. A K-drama? You can't. Why not? There are intimate scenes. What do you mean? Kissing. It's just kissing. But it's okay for us to do it. What? Want another one? Just relax. You're dropping keys. You told me that gang members are vile, negative vibes, that you really hate them. How can you date Arga? Ghea, calm down. Don't raise your voice. - You're my best friend. - What best friend? If Arga fails to manage his time, and end up choosing his gang, like how Johan chose them over me, don't come crying to me. Ghea. - Do you like it here? - Yeah, not bad. - Not bad, right? - I gotta go. - Over there? Okay. Bye. - Bye! I've missed you. - Bye. - Bye! Syera. Syera! Syera. Syera. Syera. - Syera. - Stop it! Syera. What? I don't get it. I don't get how you think. You've been telling me to keep a distance when it comes to Aldi. I can't even get close to other boys. But now you're hugging other girls. Do you think that in a marriage... ...this rule only applies to women? So guys don't have this rule? Must be nice hugging someone, huh? How does it feel? Warm? Are you jealous? What? No! Nobody is jealous. I'm telling you this just to remind you. There are two parties in a marriage. As a man you need to evaluate. You also need to know that your husband right here has a lot of fans. I even have a fanbase. ArgaLovers. Of course, I need to give them fanservice. But you're pretty when you're jealous. What the heck? What are you complimenting me for? Is that all you can do? There's something I can do better. What is it? What is something you can do better? I can give you a child. Ugh! Watch your mouth. Are you even ready to become a father? Can you raise a child? If it's for you, I can be ready. Whatever. I'm going home. Home! Husband and wife? Andre. Did you wax my ears properly? Of course. They can legally do it now. Shush. Is doing it actually illegal? You're such a know-it-all. Hey. Ghea! Arga! People are attacking us! What's wrong? - We're being attacked. - Calm down. - What is it? - Baron is attacking us. - What do we do? - Baron? Yes. Round up all the members of Agberos, okay? Take out all our weapons. Alright. - Let's go. - Come on. Where's my weapon? Attack! - Stop, wait! - Miss, where are you going? Arga! Arga! Arga! Help me! Johan! Arga! Arga! Fall back! Unbelievable. Another brawl. Aren't you bored? I can't believe it. Are you actually happy getting punished? Are you trying to get expelled? Or maybe you are just happy to see me? Definitely not that. Well, I am happy. I am happy when I see you because I get to punish you. Alright, all of you. Squat jumps, 500 times. I meant fifty, relax. I'm not that evil. Okay. Your punishment starts now. And one, and two. And three, and four. And five. Do it properly. Come on! Serves them right. Ghea. Hey. Arga, you're married? At this age? We're still in school. Have you lost your mind? You told me that... ...when it comes to girls, they're a distraction. You told me to break up with Ghea, but now you're married? Johan. Everything I'm doing now, is to honor my dad's wish. I didn't plan this. I gotta go. Bye! Ghea! Hey, Ghea. Can I talk to you? Ghe. Ghea, just for a minute. Hear me out. I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed. How can I come up to you... ...and say that I'm getting married? To Arga. What if the school finds out? It'll be a whole scene. I'm scared. I'm just upset. This huge thing must be stressing you out. You have me. You can tell me. We can have deep talks. I tell you everything. We're best friends. Remember? Thanks, Ghea. I'm sorry. Stop crying. Wipe your tears. Are you still mad? A little bit, but it's okay. But I really have something to tell you. About Arga. What is it? Is he as annoying as I predicted? I will fight him. Uhm. He… ...he kissed me. Huh? He kissed you?! - Kiss? - You're being too loud. We're married. It's okay. It was just a peck. It's still wild, Syera. You need to make sure. He's doing that to you because you're his wife, or because it's his love language? Let's go to the night fair this saturday. A date. Arga. I want to ask you. Are you being serious with me, or are you just playing? Well… ...you're always so nice to other girls. Just so you know. I know who you hugged. Her name is Zea from the 10th grade. Zea is my cousin from Makassar. She moved here. - Really? - Yes. Syera, we're married. Do you still not trust me? Do you know why I brought you here? Today is the 13th. It's the date of our marriage. It's been 3 months since we got married. Did you forget? It felt like yesterday. How has it been 3 months? So, you really forgot? I did. Don't you want to ask me for something? If I ask, you're gonna ask me for something too, right? Yes. I want to ask you one thing. If you can give it to me, I will be happy. What is it? Please don't leave me. Not until I'm done with everything. Until I have solved all my problems. After that, you can leave. You can find someone better. But for now. I need you here. I love you, Syera Jehani. We're allowed to kiss, you know. What is it? Can I sleep with you tonight? Uhm… It's okay if you don't want to. We're husband and wife anyway. We should be sleeping in the same room. 5 Tips For Your First Time Can you give me a massage? I'm tired. A little upwards. Arga. I read an article. It says... ...the first time... ...should be… ...romantic. We should take it slow. TWO MONTHS LATER Aren't you gonna get ready for school? I don't feel well. Cramps. Okay. I'll be fine on my own. You should go. Okay. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye. Take this test. Quick. I skipped school for you. Do it. It'll be fine, just take it. It's okay. Just go. I'll wait here. Syera? Syera. What's wrong? What's the result? What is it? Pregnant. It's okay. It's alright. You're married, so it's fine. It'll be a problem if you aren't. It's okay. No, Ghea. I don't wanna be pregnant. I don't want to have a child yet. I'm not ready to become a mother. And then later… ...my belly is going to grow. What if other people find out? What about school? What if they find out? Syera, it's okay. Just calm down, okay? It will be okay. There, there. You should talk to Arga about this, okay? Arga. Yes? We need to talk. Come here. I need to tell you something. But promise me. Don't be mad. I won't. Arga. Say something. What's the matter with you? Can you not act like our parents when they found out? Our parents know? What did they say? Gosh, Arga. Syera, sweetie, I told you before... These youngsters. Sweetie, I've told you about this… Gosh, now what? You should have worn protection. It's alright since you're married. Just listen and nod. Syera. Calm down. I've told you that I wanted to have a child too, remember? And? I didn't know it would be so soon. What? I'm scared of how pregnancy will be. What if I'm not ready? - I'm still a teenager. - I know. - It's risky. - Yes. What about school? What if they find out? I don't want to get kicked out. As long as we keep it a secret, it will be fine. It's still an early pregnancy. I've been late for six weeks. Since the last time I had my period. It should be fine. Your belly is not showing yet. Syera, you need to calm down. I'm here for you. Your pregnancy is our pregnancy. Shit! He's here. Elang. I don't know anything. Ziko! - What happened? - I don't know. What's going on? You little shit. You're crazy! You forgot about Agberos just because you're married. - Calm down, Jo. - What do you want? Open your eyes! Our base camp is ruined. Because of Baron! You jerk. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Didn't know? Listen. Where were you? If you can no longer be our leader, then let me lead. I'll attack Baron. We should go and attack now. - Jo, wait. - You're all coming. Jo, listen to me! All the access to their base camp is guarded heavily. They have more members than us. If you go there alone, it's a suicide mission. Use your brain, Jo. Bara. Why did you have to destroy our base camp? If you ask what I want, it's always the same. To destroy you. And your filthy members. Don't move! On your knees! Argantara. Your mother is here. -Excuse me. -Yes. Arga. Your uncle bailed you out. Let's go. Syera is waiting. Typical. You're forgetting the people who have always been there for you. I'll go if my friends get released as well. Arga. Hey. Please. Leave Agberos. You told me you want to become a husband I am proud of. Before I married you, I was always like this, Syera. Without me, Agberos will fall. I don't want anything to happen to you. Can't you think about me too? Arga. We're about to have a baby. Are you seriously gonna keep doing this? - Hello, Andre? - Arga. What is it? Bad news. Aldi is here. You sure? Yes. Okay. Syera, you haven't left yet? Not yet. Where is Arga? Are you two fighting? No. Just… ...how do I make a guy, leave an environment that's not good for him? Well… ...if it's his comfort zone, it won't be easy. I think that... ...when it comes to relationships, it shouldn't be just one person doing all the work. Both of them should work on it. It wouldn't be fair if the other just doesn't care. Sorry. My taxi is here. Do you want a ride? No, thank you. Oh, no. My driver canceled my order. Let's just ride together. Arga won't be mad. You can just tell him it's hard to get a taxi. Come on. - Run. Run! - I am. Hang in there. Gosh, the rain is so heavy. I'm drenched. You're all wet. I'll go get you a towel. The taxi is waiting. It's okay. I won't be long. - Come inside. - Really? Yes. Come on. Just a second. Bi? Bi? Wait for a moment. - Can you wait outside? - Okay. What are you doing here? Elang told me he saw you with Aldi. That's why I'm here. What are you doing? I told you not to get too close to him. It was raining. I didn't get a taxi. He offered me a ride. You could have called me. Call you? You didn't even pick up my calls. You haven't been home for days. You've been staying at your base camp. You didn't even reply to my chats. Can I even count on you? - Fine. - What? But not with Aldi! Aldi is just a friend! But he likes you! You're pregnant, and you're someone else's wife right now. As a wife, you shouldn't be going out with another guy. Isn't it inappropriate? Wife? Now you bring it up? Where have you been, Arga? You never care. Just go. Go back to your gang's base camp. Your gang is more important than us, right? It's more important for you to fight, get thrown in jail, make people mad and frustrated. - Am I right? - No, Syera. Please, you need to be patient. Okay? I need time. Be patient? Be patient waiting for you to quit your gang? Impossible, Arga. You're too comfortable there. Syera. Syera, no. You should reread the book from my mother. Chapter 71. When it comes to marriage, we are one. Every decision should be made together. Not like you, Arga. You decide on your own. You prefer being with your gang. Maybe this is the best for us. We should live our lives separately. You do your thing, and I'll do mine. Aldi was right. Relationships won't work if it's just me putting in the effort. You don't even care. Why did we even get married, Arga? Arga. Come here. Arga! Arga. Arga! Oh my God, Arga! Enough! Arga, enough! How could you do this to me, Aldi? Arga, Aldi, enough! Aldi, Arga, stop it! Stop! Arga, enough! Enough! Aldi, stop! - Dad, help! - Enough! Arga, stop it. Stop! Oh my God! Arga! - Syera! - Stop! Stop! Arga, that's enough! Aldi, enough. Go home. You should go home, Aldi. Go! Arga. What the hell is this? - Go inside. We need to talk. - That's okay, Dad. No need to. There is no use. If a person does not even want to change, it's useless to talk to him. There is no hope that he will change. Syera. Syera, sweetie! Smile, don't be sad. - Is she the one? - Oh, her? Syera, is it true? Really? What is going on? It's so noisy. - Did they say married? - They did? Hey. Hey, Ghea. What's going on? Why aren't you answering? - Syera. - Arga, everybody knows. They're seriously married? Yes, the pictures are in the teacher's room. Is she pregnant? Someone saw her at the doctor with her mother. Shush. Quiet. Syera, Arga, come with me. Is this true? And is it true... ...that Syera is pregnant? - Syera. - Syera? Syera? Syera? Syera! Syera. -Arga! -Syera! Arga, listen. I know who is behind this. Yes, Arga. We found out. It's true. Syera! Arga. Teenage marriage... ...is technically legal, but our school does not allow it. Especially when the girl is pregnant. Syera and Arga might get expelled. But even if she's married and pregnant, she still needs to get the education she deserves. You can't take that right away from her, Sir. Yes. She can take extra lessons. If she wants to stay in school. Her parents can then... ...choose a school with rules that are different than ours. Syera? Syera! The Baron members spread the photos to our teachers. I will find them, and I will attack them. All you think of is your gang. Syera. What? Why can't you think about us? About school? About our future, Arga! About our baby's future too. Don't you know how embarrassed I feel getting kicked out of school? I'm tired of you, Arga. Listen. You should choose. Me and our baby, or your gang. If you don't know the answer, don't go looking for me. Don't forget our strategy. - Okay. - The timing has to be perfect. Okay. First, we take out the pawns. Then, we take out the horses. And finally… ...we take out the king. - Got it? - Got it. Elang. I need your help. Tell the other Agberos members. I will. Agberos. United we stand, divided we fall. My life is ruined, Ghea. You're not expelled yet. Your parents asked for a committee meeting. To reach a decision. They are going to vote. It's okay. Don't stress too much, okay? Think of your baby. If only… ...I could turn back time. I wouldn't marry Arga. I wouldn't get pregnant. Not by a guy like him. Syera. Arga actually cares about you. He literally does. And he loves you so much. Johan told me yesterday. Arga has had a crush on you for so long. Did you know? Arga gets into trouble on purpose. Because he knew... ...that you were going to supervise him. Which makes him able to talk to you. He actually wants to be better, you know. For himself. For you. But the Baron members keep messing around. The leader is such a jerk. Do you know who it is? Who? Aldi. Huh? Aldi? Arga wanted to tell you. But you got mad. He's furious about it. That's why he punched Aldi. I found out from Johan. Arga wanted to settle the conflict peacefully. That's why he didn't attack. But then Baron told everyone about your marriage. Which means they're just playing with fire. And right now… ...Agberos is going to attack Baron's base camp. Are you serious? Attack! What are you doing? Hey! You jerk. Arga! Hey! You die! Shit! If you never existed, Baron would be number one. I know. You killed Aska, didn't you? So what if I killed Aska? What? I will kill you like I killed him. Got it? You're dead. I killed Aska with this dagger. Now it's your turn to die the same way. Aldi! Good job. Coward. Coward? I'm not a coward. I'm playing smart. When it comes to enemies, you can't just fight with your muscles. You need your brain. Argantara. You and I are the same. We both lost a parent. Did you know what happened when my dad remarried? I got depressed. I was suicidal. Eventually, Baron's leader helped me out. And Baron... ...became my only home. Oh, right. Baron does have a main leader. The one thing that other gangs don't know, is that there's a real leader. And me? I got into Merpati High to spy on you all. You and your gang always get on my nerves. Especially when I found out from my uncle, that Syera got married to you! You knew I've liked her for so long. But I could only stay silent because I knew.. ...that she hates gangs! But now she's married to you? I should've finished you when I had the chance. So my dad would stop caring about you. And then no stepson would climb up the rank to become an actual son. If you die, your gang would die with you. Your mother would go crazy. And Syera? She could finally be mine! - Arga? - Johan! - Arga! - Jo! - Arga! - Keep looking for them. - Arga? - Johan? Johan. Johan! Stop! Freeze! Everybody stop! Don't move! Get over here. Line up. You, get over here. Alright, move it. - You killed Aska, didn't you? - So what if I killed Aska? What? I will kill you like I killed him. Got it? - Gentlemen. Take them all in. - Yes, Sir. Syera. Look! Arga! Stop! Arga! Aldi, enough! I'll get the police. Stop! That is enough. Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop! Are you out of your minds? Do you really want to die young? Do you want to spend the rest of your lives in prison? Aldi. You think your father doesn't care about you, right? Your father never forgets about you, Aldi. He visits you every week. So he can stay close to you. You think your mother up in heaven would be happy seeing her son like this? Arga. Just so you know. Your mother cries every day. She's worried. Worried that something might happen to you. That you might risk your life. If you can't make me proud, then try making your late father proud. Be a good son. Do you really want our baby to be born without a father? Enough. Stop! Syera! Get back! My client would like to make a defense. My client is in fact the victim in this case. For so long, the Baron members have intimidated my client. They even publicized private matters of my client. They brought it to the public. It's what drove my client to commit violence, considered as juvenile delinquency. I shall write a report on this, Sir. I will continue to follow this case. How is she, Doctor? The fetus is fine and healthy. You should take it easy, get some rest. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come here, sweetie. Are you still dizzy? - Not anymore. - No. What about your body? Is it aching? I'm just traumatized. Alright, let me help you stand. Careful. It's okay. As long as you and your baby are healthy. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumussalam How is Syera? I'll be fine, Dad. Thank God. What about the meeting? The meeting is over. And? The decision… You and Arga can stay in school. Thank God. First of all, there was never a written policy... ...about students who get married and pregnant to be kicked out of school. Second, they decided this was best... ...because next month the final exams will be held. You're given a second chance. Thank you, Dad. Just stay healthy, okay? What about you and Arga now? I had a long talk with Aldi. Do you know what we talked about? Everything that happened with me, the Agberos members, Baron and everyone else, was just hurting a lot of people. People that we care about the most. It's time we put an end to it. And to try and accept the reality. Aldi. Aldi is actually really nice. You know what? When the committee was trying to decide whether or not to expel us, Aldi was one of the people who convinced them not to kick us out. Aldi wasn't the one who told the school about us. It was Bara. Aldi has quit Baron now. So… ...Baron and Agberos are… - No longer fighting? - No more. I just came back from a meeting. I am no longer the leader of Agberos. Why not? The void in me is filled now. I have you now, Syera. I love you, Argantara Reynand. I love you too, Syera Jehani. After graduation, Aldi is going to study in Germany. Bara and Panji are imprisoned.
