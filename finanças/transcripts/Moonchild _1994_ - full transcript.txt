Jacob Stryker, last member of the Moon Child project. It seems he's escaped from Sector Five. - We do not allow escapes here. Catch him and terminate him.

Look, if you're gonna shoot me, do it. If not, then stop shoving that gun up my nose. - You aren't a spy for the Sodality? - A spy? I escaped from their experimental prison center. - Follow me, but move nice and slow. Keep him covered. (tense music) - When Dictator Kronos here's of this escape, he will be furious. We must find the prisoner at once. I want all areas of the ruins checked. Leave no stone unturned. - And what about the bounty headers you requested earlier? - Send one into each subsector of the ruins. Tell them to alert us as soon as they find anything. Then they will bring him to me, and I will terminate him personally. - Yes, sir. (tense music) (crowd cheering) (intense rock music) - Welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming back once again to The Battle Pit! In this corner we have, as you all know, Talon, the reigning champion! (crowd cheering) And in this corner, a newcomer to the pit. The Black Terror! (crowd booing) On my mark. Begin! (crowd cheering) - Finish him! - Finish him! (kicks pounding) (crowd shouting) (intense rock music) (fists pounding) (crowd shouting) (kick smashing) (crowd shouting) - Talon's in the middle of a battle, so we must wait. - Which one's Talon? - The one getting beat. - He's your leader? - We may have many different leaders. When someone wants to become a leader, they must first beat Talon in the competition. He has not lost a battle in over five years. (crowd shouting) (fists pounding) (crowd shouting) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - [Woman] Get him, get him! (fists pounding) (crowd shouting) (kick smashing) (fists pounding) (crowd shouting) (crowd cheering) - Teela, how did you like to fight? - Great as usual. - Who is this? - Jacob Stryker, I escaped... - He escaped from the prison center just outside of town. - Meet me in the cafe in half an hour. - Real friendly place. You guys really make a guy feel welcome. - Talon is our best warrior. He just doesn't trust new faces. - Well, I don't trust new places. So we're even. (suspenseful music) - This is as far as we'll take you. You'll have to take the rest on foot. Shadow Khan, you're a master of several martial arts and trained in survival. You will take Sector Two, the mutant zone. Medusa, you are programmed for night battles. You will take sector Three, the underground. And finally, Trapper. Your name is very befitting, but you were a fully equipped killing machine used only when all other attempts from the government fail. You will take Sector One, the Downtown Area. - What's so more important about this escaped prisoner? - The prisoner was an experiment. We began gene splicing, mixing animal and human cells together. Jacob Stryker was our first experiment. He was put through a series of treatments, but before we could erase his memory, he escaped. - So as usual, we have to clean up another corporate screw up. Humans, can they get nothing right? - He's extremely dangerous for us. He's been put on a computer that caused accelerated learning, but he's been taught about combat, computers, everything. He knows the entire layout of our facilities. - What exactly were you splicing into his cells? What other mammal? - A Wolf. We were creating the ultimate warrior, but he became a problem. - Oh. Yeah, so why did he want out so bad? - He has a sonic captivity in prison complex five. When he escaped first time he already had the treatments. He and his wife ran to a rebel base that has been destroyed. She became pregnant and they hid her. We eventually found her and terminated her, but we did keep the child for further study and experimentations. - So what does this gene splicing do exactly? - It has given him superhuman strength and the ability to shapeshift. - What? - Like a werewolf? - Exactly. The catch is, he doesn't know about his abilities yet. You're one up on him. Just get to him before he finds out what he can do. - Affirmative. (thrilling music) (eerie music) - So you escaped from prison to save your son. Well, where is he? - I don't know. I think he's Chicago. - No way. If he was in Chicago, he would be a prisoner or dead. - Chicago was the home base of the old rebellion against the UNN. - Yeah, then Dowdy came in and destroyed the place. The lucky ones were merely killed. - The rest were used for experimentation in the new prison complex they built. - Where is this place? - It's 100, maybe 200 miles from here. You might as well forget it. - Forget my son, you're crazy! - If you're an escaped prisoner, then you have no chance of making it. - Look, you have no idea how important he is. I was given these, treatments, while I was in prison the first time. - Oh, we have a real jail bird here. How many times you been in the place? - I escaped three times, counting this one. First time I was taken in by the rebellion. The child was born about five months later. He didn't look completely human when he was born. He looked almost like an animal, a wolf or something. - Radiation? - No, doctors put him in an isolated cell under testing for days. He's like nothing they'd ever seen. His blood could combat and overcome all known diseases. He could heal himself in an accelerated rate. He could withstand the highest radiation they gave him. He was strong too. He had the strength of a child three times his age. The doctors said they'd keep his blood as a starting point to give the human race a new chance. A new lease on life. - How did you get captured again? - I was spotted when I helped the rebellion steel food from a small Sodality outpost just outside of Chicago near Elmhurst, Illinois. They took me, but I escaped en route to prison. I was recaption before I could get back to warn the rebellion. - My sister lives near here in Area Five. We should go talk to her. - Why? - She may be able to figure out a way to help. - You must be crazy. We're not gonna risk our people and our sanctuary for a stranger. - Well, if what he says is true, this child may be the last hope for a future. - One child can't save all of our ailing people. - Our scientists may be able to use his blood like the rebels we're going to do. - Hey look, bud, I'm not asking for your help. Just point me in the right direction, and I'll be on my way. - Jacob, wait, my sister has a vehicle. She can get us there safe and fast. At least go with me to meet with her. - Why, this guy did a lot of good, didn't he? - Hey look, pal, you know, I'm really sorry about your son, but I'm not about to risk these people or their homes. Not for any reason. - I'm taking him to meet my sister Athena. She will decide what we do. - I will do what she wishes. You get her blessing, and I'll do whatever. Whatever it takes to find and rescue your son. Athena is our finest leader. Her father found this community. Her wish, it will be honored by everywhere. - Let's go see this sister of yours, and save Caleb's life. (suspenseful music) (instrument crackling) (tense music) (instrument crackling) - Human, come out from where you are hiding, or I will destroy the entire block! I am looking for a man. Young, dark hair. Have you seen this man? - No, I haven't seen anybody. - Are you sure? - [Civilian] No. - Are you lying? My radar detects other human life here. - Just the scavengers. - Or rebels. I could take you before the dictator. - No, I aint no rebel! - Are you sure? - I'm positive! (rebels grunting) (suspenseful music) - No. No! No! (laser beam shooting) (guard laughing) (rebel grunting) (rebel screaming) (rebel groaning) - Let him go! (Girl groans) Let him go! (rebel groaning) (suspenseful music) - Where are you hiding the fugitive? - What in the hell you talking about? - Do not play games with me, human scum. I have no patience for it. - Listen to me, you metal head dork. I don't know anything about a fugitive. - The next lie will cost you that tongue. (fist punching) - I know something about a fugitive you asshole! I'm him! (man grunting) (foot pounding) (thrilling music) - I must go out there and help him. - No, you are too precious and so is Teela. I don't want you hurt. (fists smashing) - He would do the same for you. (Talon sighs) (fists smashing) (men grunting) (Talon groaning) (man grunting) (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (saw buzzing) (man coughing) (saw buzzing) (man shouting) (saw buzzing) (electronic buzzing) (Jacob grunting) (electricity whirring) (Jacob howls) (flesh squishing) (Talon panting) (man grunting) (sparks crackling) (sparks crackling) (man grunting) (dramatic music) - Did you guys see that? - Yeah. We saw it. - I don't believe it. This sky's incredible. - Yeah, no wonder his son is so unique. Hey, I say let's get out of here before he wakes up. - No, this could be our ticket out of this miserable underground. He could be the hero we've been waiting for. His son could help save our people who are dying of unknown diseases, we help him on his quest. (Jacob grunts) (tense music) - What happened? - You don't remember? - No, I remember Talon jumping in and then I must have blacked out. - We have a lot to tell you. Thank you for helping me. - It's okay. I owe Talon one too. - No you don't. We both owe you, you saved us both. - How could I save you when I was out cold. - You were like your son. You turn into, well, into something. - Yeah, but we just don't know what. - We need to take you to see Dr. Andronymous. She can help you with the powers. She'll hypnotize you, check out the brain patterns and find out all the secrets those bastards locked into your subconscious mind. - You mean, - You were screwed with by the powers that be. - Yeah, I guess you escaped before they could turn you into one of their mindless troopers. - Let's get back to headquarters and get ready to go find your son. (thrilling music) - In here. (thrilling music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - Oh, you nearly scared me to death. - Sorry about that. What are you doing? - Oh, I'm working with this arm. It seems that scientists at Sodality headquarters have come up with this new metal alloy that can regenerate and regroup itself. When I got it, it was just a hand, but it started growing. At least until I pull up that computer chip. I'm testing the chip now to see if I can figure out how it works. - We need your help, Doc. - Well, no problem. What can I do for you? This is Jacob. - Stryker. - Jacob Stryker. He's come to us for help. His son is being held captive by the Sodality. He's a hybrid. They could cure many diseases our people face with his blood. Jacob, we also found out is some sort of hybrid. We were out there fighting a bounty hunter, and he turned into something. We need you to find out what it was. - Well, my tools and equipment are crude, but I'll do the best I can. - [Teela] Great. (suspenseful music) - What is it? - Sir, it's been reported that the tracking module on the bounty hunter trapper has been destroyed. We searched the area directly after, but there is no signal. - He is a cyborg. All cyborgs release signals. Unless he has been dismantled. This is not good news. I really hate bad news! Send a call to the Grant's quadrant. Request that the bounty hunter Ursula be sent to us at once. And no more bad news, got it? - Yes, sir. - So let me get this straight. I'm a werewolf. A frigging goon who howls with the full moon and runs around pissing on fire hydrants? - No, you're a hybrid being. There is no such thing as a werewolf. You're a hybrid. They've combined your cells with those of a wolf. My guess is they're creating a whole army of hybrids, such as yourself, to extinguish the Southeast Dominion. Then they'd control not only the technical production, but the finances throughout the entire planet. - [Athena] So Jacob is some sort of super warrior? - Yes. And the good thing is, he's still got his own mind control. The only problem is that... - Problem? - Jacob they've installed a device in your small intestine that can cause you to spontaneously combust. When it's downtime is reached. - In people terms, doc. - There's a bomb inside of you that is scheduled to go off in about 72 hours. That means three days from the time you escaped, you'll explode from the inside. I imagine they expected you to go directly to a rebel base. And when the bomb went off, you'd destroy the place. - Wait a minute, destroy the place? How big is this explosion? - It's really big. The equivalent of at least four dozen sticks of dynamite. Well, can we extract it? Well, yes, we can, but I need the device to deactivate it. If I tried to take it out now, it would explode immediately. - Do you think they'll have one of those where they're keeping my son? - It's hard to say, but I think they would. - We'll stay here for the rest of dark, and then at sunrise we'll leave. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (device beeping) (suspenseful music) (child grunting) - Little vermin, does your mother know where you are? Where is Jacob Stryker? - Who are you talking about? - It's okay, you don't have to talk to me. I'll talk to your mind! (woman laughs) (woman grunting) (skin cracking) (child screaming) (child screaming) (laughs) Now tell me about Jacob Stryker or anything strange that's happening. - A man came looking for help. Athena and Talon are building a small group of warriors to help him. They're leaving at dawn for the Sodality Base where the stranger's son is being held. That is all I know. I swear, I swear! - Good girl, mama will be proud. Even if you don't recognize her! (woman cackles) (child screams) (soft country music) - Jacob! (soft country music) - Have a seat. - Jumpy tonight? - I have been ever since, since my wife was killed. My life was torn apart. - Yeah, I lost my parents to the plague. My world was shattered. - You aren't married? - Who has time? This place and these people are all I have. They take my whole life. - So what's the story with Talon? - There isn't much of one. Talon came to us as teenager. His father was brutally killed by the Sodality. He was one of their weapons designers. They thought he knew too much so they killed him. He's a very angry man, full of hate. - So was I. - I keep trying to tell him to let go of the hate. It only consumes you and uses you against yourself. Anger is a tool, hate's a liability. Jacob, we'll get your son. I promise that we will. Do you trust me? - Yeah. For the first time in years, I trust someone. It feels weird. - I won't let you down. Do you believe in fate? - I don't know. - Well, I do. I think everything happens for a reason. - So many innocent people die and for what? Money, power? I learned that nothing's as precious as life, human life. We're a dying species. How can you still hold on to something called fate when all you see is death? - I believe in God and faith because every day I can still find a flower blooming or a bird singing. It shows me that life is still here. - Flowers in this city? - I found one. It was crawling up through a sidewalk. I hear the birds singing at night. We haven't been forgotten. I believe fate threw us together tonight for a reason. - What's that, so I can get you all killed? - No, I needed you. I kept praying for a change, for a light of hope. You and your son are that light. - I'll be dead in two days. It won't matter. - Then you'll have the best two days of your life with me, fighting to save your son. (soft country music) ♪ All alone I ride ♪ ♪ Under the setting sun ♪ ♪ But I don't know where I'm going ♪ ♪ The sicks carry on the fight ♪ ♪ It is my only prayer ♪ - So tired of fighting, even more tired of losing. - We're all tired of fighting. But if we don't keep going, the Sodality will win. - I've got two days. Two days, 48 hours left. I'm gonna go out with a bang. - Well, not if I can help it. (soft rock music) (lips smacking) (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) Jacob, this is Weasel and... - Josh, we've already met. - We have? - Yeah, last night you saved me from that bounty hunter. - Oh right. - Glad to meet you. - What about Janet? - Well, Doc said she'd do all she could, but she's got some kind of a device and implant in her ear that's stopping her brain functions. But you don't worry, we'll figure something out. We always knew. - I've got these two vehicles here. We'll take these to the Sodality outpost. Weapons are in the trunk. I'll lead. Jacob, Teela, you ride with me. Talon, you take, Weasel. Any questions? - If I get nailed, you guys will still save Caleb, right? - Hell yes, I'm not going through all this just to leave if you get fried, hair ball. - Break it up, let me get this vehicle open. (woman groans) - What do you want? - Money, passes out of here. (woman groans) (Athena gasps) - Let her go. She's an old friend, Rochelle Conrad. Last woman survivor of the rebellion. - What in the? She just tried to kill you. - Just call me Rocky. - You shouldn't play games out here. - No doubt, somebody could have shot you. - Yeah, what they said. What if we had been the Sodality scouts? Did didn't you think of that? - No, I just crashed. I looked up, saw you guys coming. What are you doing out here, Athena? - We're going up against the Sodality to save Jacob's son. - You're going up against the Sodality? Count me in. - All right! You ride with Talon. - [Talon] Why not? (thrilling music) - Jacob. (trunk door clicks) Let's go. (Suspenseful music) (thrilling rock music) - I am Ursula, a class seven bounty hunter. General Lothos sent for me. - Yes I am your checkpoint. I am Medusa, class three bounty hunter. Jacob Stryker left heading Southwest to arrive at the outpost in approximately three and a half hours. - Thank you, I will take over the operation from here. You may ride with me if you wish. Your skills may be useful in destroying the subject. - As you wish. - Let's get the troopers loaded up. Those fools are not to reach that outpost. I want none of them breathing when we're done. (suspenseful music) (upbeat rock music) (tires screeching) - [Athena] There should be no problems until we reach the half mile line. Then they'll catch us on their radar. - They may have some scouts there though, so I'm loading up. - [Athena] Good thing. (upbeat rock music) - [Teela] It's Sodality troopers! (upbeat rock music) - Damn! Damn, the gun's jammed! (intense rock music) (gunshots popping) Damn, they're waiting for us. (intense rock music) (tires screeching) (woman shouting) (intense rock music) (tires screeching) - [Jacob] Try and hold him a little steadier and I can get one! (intense rock music) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (intense rock music) (tires screeching) (gunshots popping) - [Talon] Damn, take this, use it. - No problem there. - [Talon] Come on, motorcycles, come on! (tires screeching) - Son of a bitch! (intense rock music) (car crashing) (tires screeching) (car crashing) (intense rock music) - [Teela] You okay, Jacob? - [Jacob] I feel like a piece of taffy, but otherwise I'm fine. (gunshots popping) (intense rock music) - I blew out the radiator, they're not going nowhere. - [Jacob] All right. (intense rock music) - [Ursula] Just relax, we'll be there in no time. (thrilling music) - [Trooper] Sir! - I told you no more bad news. Send a vehicle to Ursula the bounty hunter at once and prepare my personal transport unit. I'm going to the outpost to meet our wiggly little heroes. Also, activate the tracking beacon on our spy. We will find them soon enough. (dramatic music) New orders bring Jacob Stryker to me and kill the others. - [Trooper] Yes, sir. - [Athena] We strike early, at first dawn, take them by surprise. - [Weasle] But shouldn't we just nail them now. - [Jacob] Yeah, I figured by morning, they'll all be off of the alert. - [Athena] Kind of reorganized the rebellion, our warrior group, guardians, we were the best ever. - [Weasle] You got that right. There wasn't one man in it either. - [Athena] There was no need for a man. We're the child bearers, they're not. They're the cause for all this devastation and corruption. - [Weasle] Well, men are good for some things. (sudden music) - [Trooper] That's quiet enough, all coming with us. Get up, come on. (man groans) - Move it along. - Come on let's go. - [Trooper] Get off. (suspenseful music) - [Rocky] What in the hell? - Hell I don't recall, ever asking you to speak. I'm Hades, and this is my kingdom in the nether zone. - Let us go asshole. - Such a primitive. These scavengers are all that's left of what once was Chicago, they're all mutants and cyborgs, and they get very hungry and you are a snack. - [Athena] Look, we're on our way to fight the Sodality to save Jacob's son. - [Hades] Are you crazy? The Sodality? I'm saving you from the endless torture they offer. We will kill you fast and eat you slow. - [Weasle] This mission is very important. It, it must go through. - [Hades] Them to the prison pits. - Go. (People groaning) (people chattering) (man grunts) - Keep going. (men chattering) - Hand of me. (people chattering) - [Trooper] Now. (suspenseful music) Faster. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (woman laughs) (thrilling music) - [Medusa] General Lothos come in. I have found the escaped prisoner. - [Lothos] Yes Medusa. - Yes. He's joined a group of underworld warriors. They plan to storm a Sodality stronghold near here. Jacob Stryker's son is there. - [Lothos] Yes, it all makes sense now. I'll have an anti-rebellion guard squad there in the morning. They will not make it to the stronghold, I guarantee that. - [Medusa] I will stay here to greet the squad. Medusa out. - Teela, you guys all right? - Fine. - [Rocky] Whose ready to kill some munchkins. - Good. - Hey, don't worry about me. I'm fine. - [Athena] I don't need you to be fine. - [Talon] How are we gonna get out of here? - [Weasle] I can get out of anywhere, that that's why I'm called Weasel. - [Athena] Help me out, she can get out from here. (uplifting music) (people chatter indistinctly) (dramatic music) (upbeat rock music) (upbeat music) (girl screaming) - You hit a girl. - Oh, I'm sorry. (girl screams) (punches thudding) (upbeat music) (people groaning) (punches thudding) (people grunting) (upbeat music) (people grunting) (upbeat music) (girl screams) (girl grunts) - [Hades] Enough. There was no debate about your fate. You are tomorrow's lunch - [Jacob] No way man, my son could cure these people and you. We've got save him. - [Hades] What the hell do you mean? - [Weasle] His son has special blood that can cure disease and plagues. - [Rocky] And help regenerate lost and twisted cells. We will kill you to get the boy. - [Talon] That's no joke pal. - [Teela] Be smart about this. We offer you a chance to rebuild the future of all man kind with us. Don't do this to yourself or us. - Ah, what you speak of is impossible. - [Teela] Nothing is impossible in the Sodality labs. - [Weasle] She's right, they can do anything in there. - [Hades] I will allow you to go, but I'll be waiting for you to return. There is no other way out, so you have to come back. No boy and you are dinner. - [Athena] That sounds fair enough. - [Man] I say we kill them for ever getting our way. - [Jacob] No, it's a deal. - [Hades] Go be on your way. There's a scout camp, a mile or so from here. So be careful, I sure as hell hope you're telling me the truth for your sake. - [Teela] And yours. (upbeat music) - [Jacob] There it is, the outpost where my son is. - [Weasle] I heard there's an underground passage on the east side of the building. - [Athena] Talon and I will take out the guards. You guys head to the east side. - [Jacob] Be careful, I need you. - [Talon] Get a room. (upbeat music) (punches thudding) (people groaning) (punches thudding) (dramatic music) (people groaning) (punches thudding) (dramatic music) - [Athena] The guards are down, no problem. - [Weasle] We'll get in through here, quick. (light hearted music) - [Athena] Be careful. (upbeat music) - [Weasle] Covers back in place, you never know when they be checking. - True. - I feel air coming from that direction over there. - [Talon] Oh yeah, let's go and check it out. (light hearted music) - [Man] Troopers are coming, follow me. (dramatic music) - [Rocky] Lothos. - [Talon] You are not supposed to be here. - [Lothos] Fools, did you really think you'd win? Good job Weasel. You will be rewarded like before. - [Talon] You traitor, you bitch how could you. - [Weasle] I'm not even human, I'm part of Lothos' army. - [Lothos] She helped me find some rebellion and expose their base years ago, in a different disguise, of course. You'll all be glad to see little Caleb. He's going to be my best and most vicious warrior. - [Jacob] You've hurt him enough. - [Lothos] I would never hurt him. He's my greatest key for the domination of the entire race on earth. He doesn't take after his father at all. - [Captain] What should we with them sir. - [Captain] Nothing Captain. Take them to the cell on the lower level for further question. Let's bring Jacob Stryker to the arena, I'm going introduce him to his son. - [Teela] No. (ominous music) (dramatic music) - (indistinct) bitch. It wouldn't do any good, the damage has already been done. - [Teela] She's right. We need to figure out a way to get out here. - [Athena] That should prove easy. Talon what are you doing? - [Talon] I hid this real good, trying to get help with frequency, to reach our base. - [Athena] Why? We had most of the weapons, what could they do? - [Talon] They could dock here to help save the wolf man's life. - [Rocky] He's right, he's got just 24 hours left. - [Teela] But how are we gonna get out here to help him? What is that? - I call it the in unlocker. I got off a dead Sodality scout a couple months ago. - Will it work? - Well it should, Doc said it would. - Then get to it Talon. Get us the hell out here. (dramatic music) (people shouting) - [Boy] Caleb. - [Lothos] Now my fine young boy, you'll get to see what a worthless insect your real father is. You'll see that all that I have told you proves to be absolute true. - [Caleb] And if he wins? - I'll let you terminate the worm with this. He'll want to take you back into that scum infested world out there. I have given you the ultimate life. He hates me for that. You are a very special child. He gave you to us just so he could have his freedom. He gave your mother to our scientists for experiments, just to save his own hide. Now you can have your revenge. (upbeat music) (people cheering) Let the battle between humanity and cyborgian begin. On this side we have Jacob Stryker. (spectators boo) A worthless human being. And over here, you have Ursula. (spectators cheer) Our newest warrior cyborg. Let the fight begin. (people cheer) (upbeat music) - [Jacob] I am not fighting you. I just want to save my son. - [Ursula] You are an enemy of Sodality, you must be destroyed. (upbeat music) (people yelling) (kicks thudding) (people cheering) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - [Athena] We need to find a freaking elevator. - [Talon] At least we got out. - [Athena] Trying and get Doc on that communicator. We need to find some weapons. (upbeat music) - Rebel stop. (laser gun blast) (people groaning) - Athena, Athena. Trying to get help, it's okay. (kicks thudding) (upbeat music) - [Talon] Are you okay? - How's your leg? - I'll be fine. Yeah, we've both had worse. Let's get going. - [Talon] I've reached the base. Send a Doc right away, use the last transport vehicle. Make it quick, scan our vital signs, and find us the dose. (upbeat music) (people cheer) (kicks thudding) (Ursula shrieks) (Jacob shouts) (Ursula shrieks) (electronic crackling) (people yelling) (crowd shouting) - [Jacob] Look, I have no problem with you. But if you stand my way, I'll kill you. - [Man] Stand your way? Hell, I'm here to see you save (indistinct) Get going. (upbeat music) (crowd shouting) - Great party. - You guys stay here and cover me. I'm going after my son. (people yelling) (woman shouts) (dramatic music) - [Lothos] This is where the rebel should be intercepted. - [Caleb] Good. (ominous music) (door closes) (ominous music) - He is following us, just as we had planned. (ominous music) (man groans) (girl shrieks) - Just about done here. Those that didn't die are running. Let's go help, Jacob, I'm sure he can use it. - I'm not so sure. - Yeah. We really don't wanna be near him when he gets really mad. - Am I too late? - I hope not. Jacob went that way. I say let's follow him, Josh, Josh, stay here and keep a lookout. - All right let's go. - Come on Rocky. - [Rocky] Wouldn't miss for a pizza with all the toppings. - [Medusa] Suddenly I feel like the doctor on the "Old Star Trek" TV series. (suspenseful music) - [Lothos] Great rescue hero. You couldn't save yourself. Much less anyone else? You are a poor excuse for a human being. - [Jacob] You've played with my life long enough, you bastard. - [Lothos] Well that will all end soon. Your son here will put you out of misery. - [Jacob] Caleb, why? Why won't you help me? - Because you're worthless and weak. You turned your back on me and my mother. - I loved your mother more than life. How can you say that? What have these unholy bastards done to you. - [Caleb] You gave us to the Sodality in exchange for your own freedom. - [Jacob] No, they took me to another prison. They kept me locked up. They used me for experimentation and tortured me. - [Lothos] You worth was liar. Caleb is with us now. He is safe from traitors like you. (Jacob shouts) After I've had my fun with you, we'll have junior here have a turn. - [Jacob] Son, please don't let this happen. I never desert you or your mother. I would've died for you. - [Lothos] Give it up you fool. The child will never save another human life. - Why would I put my life on the line for you, if I didn't love you? Please stop this mad man. (light hearted music) - [Lothos] Do it Caleb, kill him. (light hearted music) (Jacob panting) (man shouts) (gun shot) - Father. - Good choice son. Now help me get out of here. - I didn't mean to. - I know son. Now help me. - [Chronos] Isn't that sweet. A father, son reunion. I am the ruler of Sodality, I am Chronos, and you two are dinner and dissert. (upbeat music) - [Doc] You guys need to wait up. I'm no athlete here, you know. - Watch out. (Upbeat music) - [Teela] Come on, get him. (woman groans) (upbeat music) (kicks thudding) - [Teela] Doc. - [Doc] Just something I do from time to time. A little Mortal Kombat training. - [Weasle] That stuff about you guys being losers was all at act, I'm with you. - [Teela] No, this one is all mine. (upbeat music) - I'm gonna take that bitch. (women groaning) (people cheering) (Teela yelling) - Get him, get him. (Teela shouting) - Yeah, hey. - Good job. - Yes. - Hey, I heard some screaming from down this hallway, I bet Jacob's there. - [Athena] Let's head that way first. - [Rocky] All right kid you do all right for yourself. - [Teela] I have Athena to thank for that. (dramatic music) (man groans) - [Chronos] It's been so long since I've tasted young human. I will feast on you first. - [Jacob] No, you ugly son of a bitch. Try me. (Jacob yells) (Wolf groans) (upbeat music) (Wolf roars) (kicks thudding) (upbeat music) (kicks thudding) (Wolf groaning) (light hearted music) Caleb, Caleb. Caleb. Wake up. (ominous music) - [Man] Hello, is that you Athena. - [Medusa] Hi there, handsome. Ready to turn to stone? - Not really. Who are you? - [Medusa] Your dream girl, baby. (flesh squishing) (man shrieks) (upbeat music) (Medusa laughs) - [Athena] Come on guys, we gotta find Jacob. So this is Caleb? - Yeah. - [Jacob] I got to see him at least before. - [Talon] Hey, how much longer does he have left? - [Rocky] About two hours. - [Doc] Hey, that's just about enough time to get this bomb out of Jacob. - [Jacob] Where will we do it at? This place is crawling with troopers. - [Teela] Not anymore. We started the emergency evacuation drill. - [Talon] Yeah, by the time they come back, we'll be long gone, besides they have no leader now. - Thanks to you. - You're all right after all, man, I'll be proud to include you as leader. - [Athena] Yeah, if you can beat Talon in the arena. I might be able to, I won't even use my- - [Athena] Your beastly instinct? - [Jacob] Yeah. (upbeat music) - [Doc] Come on guys, we've gotta get this thing outta Jacob. - [Jacob] Well, no I'm not gonna explode. - Who's that lady? - Just a really good friend. Maybe more later. She kicks butt good like mom used to, I say you should jump on her. - [Athena] Hey, I heard that. - [Caleb] You don't grab her, I will. - [Boy] Not even 10, and he's already looking for action. - [Jacob] That's my boy. (people cheering) (upbeat music) - [Talon] Are you ready to do something Ed? - I'm younger than you. (people cheering) - Yeah, but I'm quicker. (spectators cheer) (upbeat music) - [Teela] Boys will be boys. - Yeah, but it's fun to watch. - Yeah. - [Rocky] I'm gonna go in there and beat both their asses if they don't start fighting pretty soon. (upbeat music) (people cheering) - Are you going to throw a punch, or just statue around all day? - [Talon] Lets go big bad wolf. (people cheering) (dramatic music) - [Ursula] It isn't over yet. Sodality has a new leader, I wonder how I'll decorate my new chambers. (Ursula laughs) (upbeat music) (ominous music) (upbeat music) (upbeat rock music) (light hearted music)
