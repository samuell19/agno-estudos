How do you do? My name is Doctor Falke, I live here in Vienna. The title of doctor is purely honorary. I've come a little early because the music will start any second now, and once the music has started we can't have our little talk. You see the place will be crowded with foreigners. English, American, Russian, French officers, and I'll be very busy. I'm the fellow who gets French champagne for the Russians, Russian vodka for the French, Scottish whisky for the English, and German cameras for the Americans, duty free. Come a bit closer. Is there anything I can do for you, or you, or you? You need a pass from the French zone into the Russian zone, or vice versa? Or a ticket for the ballet? Or the whole Corps de Ballet? Are you in trouble, because I can get you out. Just watch how I get out of my own troubles when I get arrested by the Four Power Police. Oh, not because of these little deals, oh no. Because a French colonel plays a practical joke on me. On me. But I have useful friends, and you'll see how I have ways and means to get my revenge. So do you want anything? Just a little thing, huh? Anything at all, no? Pity. Then let's go. For instance this morning, the Russian newsreel reports: Vienna five a.m., Dr. Falke, well-known Viennese man about town arrested. In the international zone early this morning when capitalists were still asleep and the workers were going proudly and conscientiously about their work the citizens of Vienna were shocked to discover high on the lap of the statue of Little Mother Agricultura recently erected and pointing the way to the Soviet Cultural Exhibition a well planned insult, obscene and frivolous, which passers by recognised as... Die Fledermaus A woman actually collapsed. The Four Power Patrol arrived on the scene, much too late, and were appealed to by the insulted proletariat: Die Fledermaus, the bat. A bat in the lap of Little Mother Agricultura? Order were given. Whistles were blown. Our men carried out a highly complicated operation. I have here before me a report giving the first word spoken by this individual. Mm, Rosalinda. Party halt! Stand at ease! Well, Falke, how about it? It all started at fancy dress ball. I was the bat. Rosalinda was a Golden Hind. Who is Rosalinda? The most attractive woman in Vienna. But who is Rosalinda? The wife of Colonel Eisenstein of the French Army. Of course, Zachary Eisenstein. How does she come into it? How does she come into it? Please tell us in your own words. It seems to me with great respect, to have happened, like this. Hopeless, but not serious. The colonel says and when daylight came the Military Police have arrested you. Quite rightly. Da, da, da. Colonel Lebotov wishes to make an announcement. He withdraws the charge against Dr. Falke. And apologises for any inconvenience - he may have caused. - Congratulations, pal. Glad you made it, chum. Thank you. Congratulations. Colonel Lebotov will demand. The court marshal of this Colonel Eisenstein. "The Biter Bit". Dr. Falke, well-known practical joker had the tables turned upon him in the early hours of this morning. Overwhelmed by the fatigues of last night's Four Power costume ball, he fell asleep, and fellow merry makers, led by Colonel Eisenstein of the French army dressed in the authentic uniform of the Vienna Fire Brigade carried him off and placed him on the matronly knees of the Russian Agricultural Statue. Only the personal intervention of General Orlofsky, USSR, who knows Dr. Falke, saved him from serious trouble. Knowing Dr. Falke, we expect prompt retaliation. Hello, hello. No, no, this is not the fire brigade. Hello? What is it darling? I don't know. I must appear before the Four Power Commission next Wednesday, but what have I done? Oh! Revenge. Thank you, pop. - Good morning, Captain. - Good morning. Steady, buster, don't rush me. Thank you Mein Herr. Bitte my foot. Look, you pay the cab and I'll see you later. Later, later. Be careful with that thing, it's got glass in it. First floor, madam. My bill, please? Will you send for my bags, I'll should be leaving in five minutes. Page. Good Evening, Captain. Good Evening. You have a reservation for me, Whig. That's right, Captain Alfred Whig, - United States Air Force. - Yes, that's right. Will you sign in, please Captain? Do you have your passport? Mm-hmm. Staying long with us? Three days, three days in Vienna. And, of course, three nights. A room with a bath, please. First floor, second floor, third floor? If the bed's good the floor doesn't interest me. Oh, I'll need a telephone. Our rooms have all the niceties. They do, huh, all the niceties? Sign here, please, Captain. How did she get behind the iron curtain? This hotel is in the Central Zone, Captain, governed by all Four Powers. This month the British are responsible for order. Wait a minute, Rosalinda I beg your pardon, sir? Paris, spring of '49, no, '50. - Rosalinda. - Madame Rosalinda... Rosalinda Bouchet, Fouchet, Touchet? She loved my voice, I sing you know. Professionally, Captain? No, not really. What you'd call a sort of bathroom tenor, I suppose. Rosalinda Rouchet, something - chet? Married, Captain. Married? To a French Colonel, Captain. Colonel Eisenstein. A French Colonel? And his name is Eisenstein? And then she could be called Eisenstein. Anything is possible when people get married Is she living here? My apologies, Captain, we can't give information about our guests. Then she is living here. Number 29, page. On the first floor, with bathroom and balcony. And all the niceties?

Good evening, Doctor Falke. Anything on? Big party tonight. How much champagne can you get? I can scratch up a dozen for you. A dozen, I need a hundred dozen. 1200 bottles? A hundred dozen doesn't necessarily mean 1200 bottles 800 of the best, hm, it's for the Russians. I'll try the French officers mess, I might get 50 dozen. Free market, of course it'll cost some dough. No importance, one of General Orlofksy's parties. And we pay for it? We've been paying for it any way. Let some of it come back to papa, huh? I've got nothing left, I'm very, very sorry. How does it go? 50 dozen from the French. We've got about 60 dozen here in the hotel, but the old man won't sell them off the premises. Can't you hold the party here? No, yes. Part of it, mm-hmm, I might be able to fix it. - Any brandy? - Huh? I've got a source of old Napoleon brandy. Left behind in Austria after the battle of Austerlitz. 1805, I know, all right 100 bottles. How genuine are they? The bottles? Guaranteed genuine. Not the brandy. All right, here's some - invitation cards. - Are you coming - to the bar, Falke? - Yes. Only the prettiest girls, please. None left behind by Napoleon. Oh, no. Is Colonel Eisenstein in? Just got in. - How does he look? - Gloomy. Count on me. Dr. Falke is here. Falke, I want to see him. Adele. May I come in? - Traitor. - I? You, you promised to talk to the Russians. But I did. Oh, it was the photographs did it. Instead of five days I got eight. You call that help? Because of you Rosalinda is practically a widow. Hm, what a widow. Who had the wonderful idea to put the bat up there? Ha, Rosalinda. Who stole the fire escape from the fire station? The chief of the fire brigade? And who's the bosom friend of the chief of the fire brigade? Adele, of course. And who sent for the photographers? - You. - I? - You. - But I was fast asleep. How could I have done it? I don't know. All right, I'll tell you. I telephoned the photographers and we restaged the whole thing for "Time and Life". Well, I live on publicity. How could I miss such a chance? What's this, battle dress? What do you expect me to wear? Evening mess kit? Just the thing. Yes, you seem to forget that I am going to jail tonight at nine o'clock. Oh no you won't. What do you mean I won't. You won't. Take those things off. Are you crazy? Ah, here we are. Navy blue mess kit, silver braid, silver buttons, blue waistcoat. Oh, mm. Silk socks, patent shoes. Stiff shirt. Where's your kepi? Ah, I beg your pardon. Here you are. No, not that, the pale blue one. Oh, I beg your pardon. Now listen, do you General Orlofsky? Do I know General Orlofsky? No, no, and again, no. That must been after only two bottles of vodka. He's a charming fellow after three. Anyway, he's giving a party tonight, one of those fabulous Russian parties. The best food, the best wine, and the prettiest girls. If you know what I mean. Ah, now you are crazy. What time do you have to report? Oh, nine o'clock. Simple, instead of nine you report shortly after midnight. - But, but, but... - No, don't butt in. I know the chief of the British military police. He's a very charming fellow, a friend of mine. I'll telephone him and fix it. Do you think he likes people arriving at nine o'clock is his prison when everybody in Vienna is at the theatre or dancing or opera? Of course he doesn't. He'd be grateful to me. It's the way I make friends, my dear fellow. But this Soviet general, he doesn't want a French officer at his party. Don't be so silly. Everybody wants a French officer at his party. Er, here's your invitation card. Uh-huh, Colonel le Marquis de Toulouse Lautrec. That's me, but... Do you want want to come to the party or don't you? - Of course I do! - All right then, I'll go and telephone Major Frank. 026470. Is this telephone safe? International barracks? This is Dr. Falke speaking, will you put me through to Major Frank, please. He's expecting my call. Hello, Frank. This is the Fledermaus speaking about this evening. I've got your invitation card. Yes, I should think so, half Vienna would like to have one. I'll send it around. Don't be too late, I've got a reason. Of course, I've got a reason. A very attractive reason. Especially for you. She's an actress. No, not a film actress, not yet, just an actress, but lots of talent, lots of talent. So long, Frank. Everything fixed, you report as soon after midnight as you can manage. Wonderful, who says so? The commandant, he was very sympathetic. I told him you had some very important family business this evening.

Put on our naughtiest dress, put diamonds in your ears and in your eyes and meet me downstairs in the bar, hm. Come along, Falke. Woohoo! Ros. Alfred. Hiya, skinny, have you missed me? I have forgotten you completely. Have you forgotten everything completely? Everything, and before you go any further, Alfred, I'm married. But I'm not going any further, I like it here. Right next door. How about having a drink together, just for old times sake? You know I think I've got just enough muscle left to shake you up an Alfred Special. Remember, out like a light. You must be mad to think I would come into your room. Well, uh, we can start in the bar then. My husband is in the bar. It stays open after he goes to jail, I hope. You don't think seriously that... You know me, I never think seriously. Oh, Ros. Well? Have you really forgotten about the old times in Paris? Yes, and I don't think that a gentleman should talk about old times to a lady.

No, no, not at the belfry, I'm at the party that General Orlofsky is giving at the Palais Krotzenburg. Wait a minute Rosalinda, did I ever telephone you without reason? Of course I've got a reason, you see, this is a wonderful party, lots of people, oh I know you're not interested in people but, I thought you might be interested in something. For instance there's a young lady, a very charming young lady, she wants to be an airhostess. Or an actress, or anything. She's wearing a Paris gown which looks familiar to me, mm-hmm. I think you must both go to the same coutelier. The gown, oh very little up top, a very full skirt. Sequin and lace. Chiffon. Hold on! Oh! Hello. Yes, yes. Well, the other one is a French gentleman. Yes, very tall, very charming. Mad about dancing, I thought you might like him. Although some people say he is a escaped prisoner from the international barracks.

"5,500 Ways of Saying No", no. Ah, it's a good standard work. Yes, but in Vienna, it would only be read by the ladies. The ladies, ah well, Falke, how is my party going, huh? Everything under control, General. The prettiest girls in Vienna, the best orchestra. A picked lot of officers from all Four Powers. That I like. And a first class practical joke. Um, Lebatov. What is practical joke in our language? Continue my friend. You remember Eisenstein? Ja, da. Well, I've been persuaded him... Lebatov, what... No, no, I mean instead of letting him go to the barracks right away I brought him here to your party under the pseudonym of the Marquis de Toulouse Lautrec. Lebatov, what is pseudonym in our language? Pseudonym, Tovarich General. Pseudonym, ah. The commandant of the prison will come too. A Major Frank, an Englishman, without knowing who Eisenstein is, of course. Mm-hmm. And then I've invited Eisenstein's maid. Pretty? And I've just telephone Madam Eisenstein. She'll be here very shortly, and then you will see. Whew, fireworks. Yes, I know, I have ordered fireworks. Yeah, hmm. Yes, there's only one thing, General. We are a little short of caviar and champagne. Ah, these shortages in the capitalistic countries are deplorable. Quite so, quite so, but leave it to me. I've got reserves somewhere. Lebatov, what is reserve? I'll look it up. And if you will trust me, General, I have every reason to believe... Lebatov, what is reason in our language? I'm afraid you haven't got a word for that. You know, I think we have met before somewhere. But in any case, the masks will be coming off very shortly and then we shall be able to see, hmm. You don't have to wait if you're interested. I've got nothing to hide. You mean we can cheat a little? Ah, adorable. I have something to show you, listen. How do you like my watch? Oh, it's pretty. Is it valuable? It's no ordinary watch, now listen. Oh, a chiming watch. What do you use that for? I use it to count the heartbeats of beautiful ladies. Do they beat different? Do they beat differently! Now, yours for instance... Tell me how I can hear yours. - It's going boom, boom, boom. - But that dress. Just one moment, no please. All right my dear, I will be back very shortly. Excuse me, Adele, what are you doing here and in that dress? Who are you talking to, Mein Herr? Ha ah, I am talking to you, Adele. What is this French colonel talking about? I'm talking about that dress. My dress! What is wrong with my dress? - It's lovely. - You know perfectly well what I mean. - Boom. - Isn't he funny. Adele, how dare you! My name is Olga. Your name is Adele, you are my wife's personal maid and that dress belongs to your mistress. Not before midnight, old boy. No doubt your wife can support your statement. My, my wife has nothing whatever to do with it. With her own dress, really, Mein Herr. But why are you so nervous, Marquis? Now listen Falke my friend, you know the truth. You know that this is Adele. But, but, but this is Olga. Olga, Olga who? Olga Volga, the movie star from behind the Iron Curtain. I say old man, you really must be more careful about making allegations of this sort. My dear sir, I don't think we have the honour of each other's acquaintance. May I introduce you, please.

Drunk, yes sirs, here sirs. Have a drunk sir, er sirs. Now let's get this clear, Frosh. You say you see two majors? Two doors, two water taps, all two. But, Colonel Eisenstein, I see Vier, four. Four Eisensteins? Yeah, four. Two Eisenstein in Zelle Funf and two Eisenstein in Guard room. Throw 'em out, Frosh, kick 'em out. Good, I kick,. They say no Eisenstein. Not even one Eisenstein. Not two yanks, one yank. Ah ha, only one of you. What does Eisenstein sing, quartets? No, duets. Huh, Frosh, Frosh? - Sir? - Oh. This is the place, General. I have arranged with the manager. We can have 500 bottle of champagne from his special reserve. Reserve huh, good, good. And the third act of my practical joke will be played here. Good, good. Good morning, Dr. Falke, sir. Everything arranged with the manager, we are going to have a little party here. Yes, Dr. Falke, sir. The manager gave me the keys of the cellar. We shall need some waiters. I'm afraid they've all gone to bed. Wake them up, wake the orchestra up too. But, our guests in the hotel, Doctor. It's very late. What are you talking about? Isn't this a first class hotel? But, the night patrol, sirs, the Russians are very sharp these days. Oh, beg your pardon, Mr. General, sir. Oh, Lebatov, wake everybody up. Don't worry about the Russians, I take the blame. If you say so, Dr. Falke, sir. Everything under control, General. Good, good. What are we waiting for, Boris? What is signal in your language, General? ♪ Who can say ♪ ♪ Will love stay ♪ ♪ Let's be happy while we may ♪ ♪ So today ♪ ♪ Why delay ♪ ♪ For dreams will fade away ♪ ♪ Sing, sing, sing ♪ Sing, sing, what am I saying? I gotta get out of here. Let me out! Oh you poor devil, you. Hey! Oh. Haha, wait a minute, hmm. - Haven't we met before? - Well not that I know of. Are you gonna release me, Colonel? Say, I think we have, in fact. Oh, enchante, release you? You are prisoner? I'll say I am, but I'm innocent, Colonel, innocent. Oh, well what have you done? It's funny you know, because I want to be a prisoner, they don't want to take me. What did you do, tell me? Nothing, nothing, I was um, trapped with a lady. Oh, my poor boy, husband? Oh no, he wasn't there. How did it happen? Well, it was in their apartment. She was in negligee, I was in his robe. Who's robe? Well this robe, the husband's. Oh, well that's perfectly reasonable. They shouldn't expect you to bring your own. - Well, hardly. - Who caught you? Why these idiots here. They weren't after me, they were after the husband. You mean the police were after the husband? What could I do, I mean it was just like a French bedroom farce. Just like a French bedroom farce, ha ha. There was I looking like a husband, I suppose. There was she, looking so like a wife. She, she was a blonde of course? Who? Ros? What did you say the lady's name was? Ah, ah, ah, Colonel, as we say in America, Excuse me. Does the name Eisenstein mean anything to you? Not a thing. Eisenstein! You mean you're Eisenstein? Well, well, wait a minute, you should be in here and I should be - out there. - Oh, no! Help! Talk to my wife first. - Murder! - And after I have talked to her, I will talk to you. Let me out of here! Help! I'm not Eisenstein, he's got away. Murder, fire! Help. Frosh. Oh, come on Major, we got to go get him. It'll be a crime passionel, you know these French husbands. Good morning, Colonel Eisenstein. Shall I take you up, sir? Hello. My husband! Rosalinda. Mm, darling. Darling, have you escaped? Rosalinda, what is this? A tunic, darling, an officers tunic. It's yours, no? No, it is an American officer's tunic. I ask you Rosalinda, what is an American officer's tunic doing in a French officer's bathroom? I don't know. You don't know? Lease lend I suppose. No, no, it is not lease lend. It is, it is... I cannot say the word. What word, darling? The moment your husband is safely in jail you are entertaining strangers in our home. Americans. Don't be silly, Americans are not stranger. They are allies. I want to know the truth. And you'd better tell me, I warn you, I know everything. If you know everything what do you expect to learn from me? The reason why! Don't I give you everything you want? Don't I adore you? Do I ever give you a moment's anxiety? Of course you don't. Of course I don't. Do I ever flirt with another woman? Of course you do. Of course I... Huh, what are you saying? I say you are a charming husband who is mentally unfaithful to me with every pretty woman he meets. How dare you. Only luckily for you, most of the women you flirt with don't take you seriously. Ah, what are you saying, give me one proof. That's all I ask, just one proof, ha, ha, ha. ♪ Tra la la la la la la la ♪ Oh, Rosalinda. You Mormon! Take your watch. And your tunic. And this, and that. And take your silly photo out of my bedroom. Liar, cheat, swindler. Boom, lousy boom. Rosalinda, please darling listen, I assure you... Don't assure me. I wouldn't be assured by you if you were a whole company of assurance. Rosalinda, please, darling, don't shout, don't wake the whole hotel, I can explain. Hahaha, explain indeed, as if you can. I wish the whole hotel could hear your lies. Rosalinda, please darling. Don't shout, I, please, calm yourself, please. Imagine you coming here with your gun in your hand. Huh, why don't you use it? Shh, darling, you don't want the people in the next room to hear you! I do, I want the whole of Vienna to know it.

And when I say spoiling I'm not thinking only of your champagne, and whisky, vodka, and Coca-Cola. We are very proud that you love us so much, and I can assure you, we love you too.
