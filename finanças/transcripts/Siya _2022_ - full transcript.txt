Hey! Are you asleep? Sister, I'm wide awake. Sis, what happens next in the story? I'll tell you tomorrow. Sleep now. No, no. Tell me now. OK. Where were we? The lamb went to see the lion... So, the lamb said to the lion king, another lion has come to live in the jungle. Oh. The lion got furious when he heard the news. Taking the lamb with him, he set off towards the well. When he saw his own reflection, thinking it was the other lion, he jumped into the well. Oh. All the animals were happy that they were free of the lion now. They took the lamb on their shoulders. Tell me, what does the story teach us? That the lion jumped into the well. The lion jumped into the well? And the lamb didn't know how to? - It did. - It could jump in, too. Yes. Oh, sis! Don't ask me that. OK. The story tells us a little lamb using its brains and courage can defeat even the fiercest lion. - Now do you get it, young sir? - I do! Siya! Can you drop Suraj on the way? Get the wheat ground as well. Listen. Come back soon. She's still obsessed with getting a job. Suman must be behind it. What happened to my tea? Suraj! Tuck your shirt in. You never bother about your family. Sis, you haven't told me a story for days. You didn't tell me one yesterday. Will you tell me one tonight? Siya! Hey, Deepak! Oh, come on. Stop shouting. Wait! We're here. There's Siya. Hurry up. Hop on! She'll get away. Hey. Siya! Faster! Wow! You were born to ride a cycle. Come, ride with us. Siya, stop! What's wrong? What! Pulling your pants up again? Hurry up! Siya. There she's going to fall. Are you scared? What are you boys doing? Social work. Most diligently. Shankar's daughter didn't see the wheat spilling out of her bag. Pick up the grains! See? She didn't hear. Mahender, when did you arrive from Delhi? - When are you going back? - I'm here for a while. So you are! See you. - What are you doing here? - I'll tell you. Amma asked me to bring the keys. - Did you talk to him? - No. It's your problem. Go, collect it from him. Tell him if Anil Pratap gets involved, he's had it. - Namaste, brother. - Namaskar. Have you got the keys? - I'll phone you. - OK, go! I'll tell him this evening. Yes, OK. - Is Daddu in? - Yes, he's waiting for you. I must go. - See you this evening. - Yes, of course. Open up! Sudha! There's good news. Neta-ji will help Siya get a job. It should be settled in a few weeks. When Siya hears about it, she'll be very happy. Where is Siya? I haven't seen her for the last few days. Doesn't the idea of her working please you? She's of a marriageable age and you talk of a job. She'll marry soon enough. Send Siya to me. I'll explain it to her. Is she at home? The wheat isn't ground. And there's less of it. What's all this? Don't ask me. Ask Siya. Siya! Siya! Hey, Siya! Come out. What did you do? Where did you spill the wheat? Crazy girl. Never mind. There's only a little missing. Are you OK, Siya? I hope you didn't get hurt. Get out! Don't touch me. Is that the way to talk? Siya. Are you all right? Get out! Namaste. It's me, Siya. Siya? Mahender Babu, I want to go to Delhi. Delhi? What for? I don't like it here. I want to go to my aunt's. You don't like living in this village? I'm not going at once. I can pass on a message to your aunt, if you want. Have you told your parents? Just book me a ticket, I'll take care of the rest. What will you take care of? Siya, you're still a child. Delhi is a very big city. Go, just go home quietly. Go. Stay away from those village boys. They're rascals. How can I explain it to you? - Just give me a little money. - Siya! What's got into you? What will you do in Delhi? If it's about a job, tell me, I'll try and arrange something. It's not easy finding a job in Delhi. You're better off here. Wait. I'll walk you home. Wait! Hello, brother. I'm driving. I'm getting your work done. Look, there's Siya. Stop the car near her. Siya! Can't you hear? Get in the car. Wait! Will you run faster than me? You don't listen when I say it nicely. Why must you make me angry? The other day I tried being nice to you. But no, you won't listen to me. Come, now I'll show you. Let go! You never listen to me. Shut up! He's waiting. Sit quietly. Be quiet! Siya has been missing for twelve hours. If she had taken the bus, she'd be in Delhi by now. The thing is... I think we should go to the police station. No, no. Let's wait a little longer. What do you say? OK. We'll wait. No, don't worry. I'm here. Yes, OK. - Where's Suraj? - He's inside, lying down. Are you tired? Namaste, Inspector sir. Sir, our girl has been missing since yesterday. Did you get married? You look very young. Sir, our girl has been missing since yesterday. - Aren't you from Bhangwa ki Chungi? - Yes. - Are you a *****? - Yes. Well? Sir, their daughter, Siya, has been missing since yesterday morning. - Whose daughter? - His. Shankar's. So you shut up! Saheb, he's my brother-in-law's friend. He's like family. Sir, Mahender works as a lawyer in Delhi. - A criminal lawyer? - I'm a lawyer, but I do notary work. Ha! Then you're no lawyer. Let's go. Take off your damn shoes. What is it? - Whose daughter is missing? - Brother Shankar's. So let him sit down. Sit! - Brother. - Sit! Sister-in-law, you sit. Have a seat. Listen. She's a young girl. She must've gone somewhere with her friends. Sir, she never goes anywhere without informing us. You have a TV at home? She must've watched some movie, now she's run away. Will you file a report, Mr. Pandey? I can write one right now. Do you want to file an FIR? Or do you want to find the girl? You'll be disgraced. Your daughter will be found. I've noted it all down. It's done. Now go. Go! We need to file... You can go. Must I address you separately? Go! Where to? Why are you so impatient? Any news about Siya? It's been two days. Can you file an FIR? An FIR won't bring her back. We must look for her. And that's what we're doing. Go home. Let's go. Go home! They're looking for her, that's fine, but filing an FIR is very important. If it's not... I don't understand anything. I know you'll do what's right. Get up! Stand! Bend over! Chaurasiya, hit this fellow. Hit him. You want to steal a motorbike? Right? Stealing a motorbike, eh? - Throw him in the lock up for ten days. - Bend over! Bend over, I said. - Take him away! - OK, sir. Mummy. Mummy, where is my sister? Wake up! Get up! Who are you? Why are you sitting on my bed? Sit over there. Did you post this news about Devganj? "Police carelessness can weigh heavily on the girl's parents." My name is Prasad. I work for Duniya News. I read your post. It could be a good story. I can't promise it'll get printed, but if it does, it'll earn me 500-rupees. Brother, you called for me? Have you read the Devganj news? No. Have a look. Page 8. Read it. Bottom of the page. Nothing to worry about, brother. It's just a small news item. No one reads this paper anyway. And it's on page 8. I see. A major incident has taken place in Devganj. It's in the newspapers, and you have no clue. You think I need this so close to the elections? I'm working 24/7 to improve the Party's image. I'm preparing to become an MP. While you'll make me lose my Councillor's seat even. - Don't worry, brother, I'll fix it... - Enough! You take it easy. I don't want any more trouble. Call Pandey. Brother... Who's in charge of the Soraiya station? Shekhar. Tell him to come here. Councillor, your work will be done. I get it, Councillor. We'll get it done. Just as you say. Have your tea. Yes, sir? Hello? Yes, it'll be done. This evening... Councillor, rest assured. We'll get it done. Just as you've asked. May we go? We will grab the boys by the evening. This evening. Deepak. Don't kill him. Catch him alive. Go, get him. Hello, hello? Brother? Brother Anil... Come on, move it! Come on. Grab him, he's escaping. Take him away, hurry! - Sir? - Yes. We'll need one of your cars. This car will be following you. - This one? - Yes. - Do let your driver know. - I will. Hey, Pandey. Stop. I'm trying to talk to him. Do you know whose instructions we're following? What's this mess you've made? Give me the phone. Let me call Anil Pratap. Give it to me. What is this? What are you staring at? Take him away. Move! Park here. Chaurasia, are you taking them for a stroll? - Come on, hurry up! - Don't you get it? Move it. These bastards don't get it. Move! Take them inside. Get inside, go on. Move it. - Bharti. - Yes, sir? Bharti, bring her inside. Pushpa. Give her a bath. Come, child. Come. We prepared the report last night, just as you asked. - You did the right thing... - Sir. Just a minute. You've brought too many files. Savita Singh. This is the one. Put the others away. Something's fallen out. Come. It's done. Get up. Have you gone through it carefully, doctor? The examination is going on right in front of you. Easy. - How is she now? - She's OK. - Chaurasia... - Yes, sir? - Put your clothes on. - Take this. Get the car out. Yes, sir. - I'll be off then. - Fine. Coming to court, right? Sure. I'll be right there. - I'll be waiting for you. - I'll join you, no worries. Sit here. Make her sit there. It looks like you bathed her before bringing her here. You never follow procedure. When did you find her? We raided Soraiya last night at around 9 p.m. That's where we rescued her. 9 p.m.? The report says 6. - When was her medical done? - This morning. If you found her last night, why didn't you get it done at once? It was late by the time we got back from Devganj. I couldn't get hold of the doctor. You find people when it suits you. How long was she in Soraiya? 7 or 8 days. 7? Or 8? 6 days, madam. Where's the doctor who examined her? Bring Sita Singh forward. Make her sit. Sita? Sita? - Have you given her anything to eat? - Yes, madam. Get her some water. Open it. So she can drink. Are you all right, child? Can you talk? Can you testify today? On the 9th of February, I was walking to the bus stop to catch a bus to Delhi. Can't you hear? Get in the car. You keep running away. When Bachchan Singh and Deepak Tiwari got out of the car, they tripped me and I fell. They dragged me into the car and made me lie in the back. They beat me badly. He pulled off my clothes. I don't remember when I came round. When I came to my senses, I saw I was tied up in chains. Ma! Help. Ma. Help me. Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Help. Ma. Ma! They starved me. They gave me nothing to eat for three days. There were three other men. I didn't know them. Nor did I recognise them. They abused me too. They would get drunk and abuse me every day. And show me the video. It went on for a week. Day and night. Will you go? No, later. They threatened to kill me. They threatened to abduct my younger brother, Suraj. They kept raping me. I thought I'd die. I want to see my mother. I want to see Suraj. I want to go home. I want to go home. Siya. My dear child. Are you done? Yes, sir. Yes, brother Arunoday. We followed your plan to the letter. Let me know. I'll see you. OK? OK. Come, Siya, talk to your granny. - Another bite? - Yes. "The ostrich is the biggest of birds." Let me read it for you. "The ostrich... Sister! - What? - Look! You were supposed to return earlier. It's a long story. - I'll tell you some other time. - What happened? Your Mahender is back! He was anxiously waiting for you. Salaams! Give it to me. - Have a seat. - Will you do my work? Of course I will. "Rabbit hops. Monkey swims." You rascal! Give me the eraser. Suraj. Suraj! Siya. I made your favourite dish. Eat, my child. I want to go to Delhi, to my aunt's. Noida! Noida! Let's go. Stop here. - How much? - 140. Here you are. Come. Let me. Come. It's fine, child. Come. Come. Aunty, I came here to be with you. I won't let you go anywhere now. Come. Come inside. Sit. I went to the market. Look what I've got for you. See, it's such a nice colour. Do you like it? Stand up. What have you decided? What about her marriage? But how? The entire village knows. How can we ever save face? In time, you will. Siya did all the chores, even getting the wheat ground... Speak softly. We can hear you inside. Use your brains a little. Add these two tomatoes. Siya, up to which standard did you study? 6th. - Do you want to continue studying? - Can I? Of course you can. Before you can read weighty books, you'll have to study some more. Right? Will I be able to read this? No one can read everything to start off with. It takes time, but slowly you can read everything. Put it straight. Siya, I'll get you admitted to a private school. OK. I'll talk to brother Shankar, and to your uncle. You can go to the same school as your cousin. Namaste! Namaste! We've all worked very hard to get you bail. The boy knows that. This is a sensitive matter. - True. - Lay low for a few days... I won't spare you. Control him. Hold him. He's misbehaving. Mr. Pandey, sorry. He's just a hot-blooded boy. - OK, take him away. - Very well. Hello, Prasad, where are you? I've been trying to reach you all morning. You're in court? What? They were let off? All of them? Didn't they apply the Child Protection Act? She's only 17, Prasad. A minor. How could the District Court give them bail? No, we are not going to let them off the hook so easily. The fight is not over yet, Prasad. The problem is the girl's father and uncle don't want to pursue the matter. - Why would we want to? - Just a minute. Do you have a copy of the judgement order? OK, have a copy made. Let it drop. Yes. OK, Prasad, I'll call you later. Yes, OK. Yes. Why continue fighting? It'll get resolved. - Are you OK, Siya? - Get in the car. Siya. What happened? Siya. What's wrong? What is it, child? Come, come to me. Come on, get up. Stand up, stand up. Come to me. Don't be frightened. Come close to me. Come and lie down here. Easy. - Uncle, there's a call for you. - Yes, child. It's Daddu. Is that Jagdish? Yes, Daddu. Namaskar, Daddu. Look, Jagdish, you're like family to me. Yes, Daddu. I told Suman that I'd find your niece a job. I've known you for years. You've worked very hard for me. I can't forget that. Yes, sir. I've heard what your niece had to endure. Siya? Yes, Daddu. Her name is Siya. I feel terrible about it. Bachchan is a member of my family. What can I say? Siya is like a daughter to me. Jagdish. Marry her off. I'll cover all the wedding expenses. We're very grateful to you, but marriage... If I reported your past crimes, what would happen to you? Convince the others. Tell that opportunist ***** not to cause any trouble. Take your phone off the speaker and listen to me carefully. Yes, sir? We'll see what's best for her. No. All we need are your blessings. How can I marry him? He's the one who did this to me. You're not going anywhere. I'm right here for you. Look! Look at me. I'm right here with you. Don't be scared, no harm will come to you. Nothing will happen. I suggest... Are you listening? Listen.Â When they're trying to put an end to this, what's the harm in that? Mahender doesn't seem to understand. I don't know what he wants to do. What good is fighting endlessly? If she marries Bachchan, it'll shut everyone up. Who else will marry her? Tell me! What are you saying? Are you even thinking straight? You just blurt out anything. You want her to marry the man who put her in this terrible state? Can't you see? I'm not saying we're marrying her off tomorrow. Shall I serve you food? What are you cooking, child? Is the food ready? We'll all eat together. Mahender Babu. Siya? How is it possible? How can they be let off? Nowadays powerful people get away with anything. We have two options. One, to endure in silence. Second, to fight injustice bravely. I want to fight. I want justice. It isn't that easy, Siya. It'll be a long battle. And your father and uncle don't want to fight. What if you decide to give up half-way? I will fight. Take this paper. Write down everything that happened to you. In detail. OK. Look, child. What you're planning - I don't think it's right. They're very powerful people. We don't have the power or the money to fight them. And you know that's what we need for a legal battle. Be careful, my child. We might get ruined in the process. Siya, what is this? You said I should write it all down. Is this what you wanted to tell me when you came that morning? You should have told me. I won't back down. I want justice. I'm going home. - We'll join you soon. - OK. This statement will be sent to a High Court judge, the Governor, the Chief Minister. District Officer, Superintendent of Police. Send it by registered post. Keep the receipt with you. OK, fine. It'll come in handy. Mahadev! Is the lawyer here? Siya, come on. Get up. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What's wrong? Well, old man? You don't understand when you're told nicely? You've become a regular at the courts. I told you it's a family matter. We'll sort it amongst ourselves. But you're stubborn! Sudha. You want to fight? - Do you have the guts? - Anil Pratap, let go of my son. Take him away. - Stop. - Let's go. - Anil Pratap took him away. - Open the door! Will you go against us? - What you doing? - You prefer the courts and the police? Drag him! qaLet go. The police and the courts are in my pocket. Where are you taking him? You think you're smart! Get the rope! Tie him up. Cool his head down. He's too hot-blooded! - Mother, what are they doing? - Go there and see. Won't you listen? Tell that Mahender we'll do the same to him. They forget what they're told. What have they done? - Have you talked some sense into him? - Yes. Finish him off. Pick him up! What are you doing? Where are you taking him? He's bleeding. - Where are you taking him? - Get off! He's being arrested under the Arms Act. We have a warrant. - Throw him in. - Shut up! Get him in there. A sensational video has gone viral concerning the Devganj rape case. It is claimed that it's a video of the victim's father. He was badly injured and admitted to hospital. We warn you. This video contains disturbing images. "Arunoday Pratap Singh "and his younger brother, Anil Pratap Singh, "had me beaten up. "They tied me to a tree and hit me. "Even in custody, the policemen "beat me up." I am so worried. I hope he's all right. It'll be OK. Don't worry. It's on TV now. We'll make sure we take Shankar home. Is this the way to the hospital? I don't know where they're taking us. - Where are you taking us? - Pandey. Tell me where we are. Just come out. Come, see for yourself. Tell me where you're taking us. - What is going on? - No funeral rites? - We have orders. - What? Brother. Brother! Dadda! Dadda! The family have been brought here in the middle of the night. They're cremating the girl's father illegally. The family were not even consulted. The funeral is being done by force. This is totally unjust. The girl's family is being harassed. And no one cares. This is an outrage. The atrocities committed by the State are increasing daily. There has been no hearing. The family had gone to collect Shankar from the hospital... Have you gone crazy? Don't you get it? - Stop playing the hero! - What's going on? Hold this phone. This man's always playing the hero. The family have been brought here in the middle of the night. They're cremating the girl's father illegally and by force. The family were not even consulted. This is an outrage.. The girl's family is being harassed. This is an atrocity. Namaskar. Yes? My name is Neha Dibakar, from ABI News. We just heard the girl's father was cremated against the family's wishes. What are your views on this? I am unaware of this. I've no such official information. I'll check and get back to you. Sir, the cremation video of the girl's father has gone viral. It clearly claims he was murdered by your younger brother, Anil Pratap Singh. Any comments? Mere rumours. Shankar was arrested under the Arms Act. We hear the government has a special team looking into the Devganj rape case. And it's crucial. The girl deserves justice. So does her family. I want Devganj to get justice. We just heard the Chief Minister has asked the CBI to step in. Regarding the Devganj rape case, the High Court has ordered the State government to initiate a CBI enquiry. SIT has already prepared an enquiry report. But it has yet to be made public. Our sources tell us MLA Arunoday Singh and his brother have been implicated. Tell me your full name. Sita. Sita Singh. Father's name? The deceased Shankar Singh. Address? Bichaura Village, Bhangwa ki Chungi. Age? 17. Can you speak a little louder? 17 years. The last time you left your home you went straight to Mahender's house. Why? Arunoday Pratap Singh. When did you first meet him? You go to the Councillor's house at 8.30 p.m. to ask for a job? 8.30 at night? In the statement you gave to the Magistrate, you've named Bachchan and Tiwari. And in this statement, you've named Arunoday Pratap Singh. And in this third statement, you say something else. I just want to know what is true and what isn't? Siya! Why are you crying? Wait. I'm here. Don't worry. Don't cry. Can she be accompanied inside? Not now. We need her to give us another statement. - We're right here. - Come, I'll go with you. We'll be back soon. Come, let's go. Who are these people? Pandey and the officers who were suspended. They wish to meet you. We'll see about that later. Relax. Don't be scared. Shall we start again? On the 4th of February, at around 9 p.m. The MLA Councillor Arunoday Pratap Singh called me home under the pretext of giving me a job. What took you so long? He's been waiting. Come on inside. - Why has he called me so late? - Come on. He's busy in the day. That's why he's called you at night. Aunty, but it's so dark back here. Where is the Councillor? Come on. Aunty, the Councillor will recognise me, won't he? Of course, he will. Why wouldn't he? - And the job? - You'll get it for sure. Don't worry. - Ma may object. - Did you tell her you're here? Let's go. Come on. Pay your respects. Aunty! I'll be right back. I'll just make a quick call. - Go inside. I'll just come. - Aunty! Come inside. - I hope you didn't get hurt. - Get out! Don't touch me. Hold her. You were saved, thanks to the Councillor. His name must not be mentioned. I assure you. He'll protect you. Remember you have a family, a young brother. You have to think about them. So think carefully before you give your statement. I'm afraid we must recreate the scene. You should've been more careful. You're a lawyer, you could've at least filed an FIR. Sir, they made me take off my shoes before entering the station. I tried very hard to get the FIR filed. The Inspector refused. Siya! Suraj! The clay tells the potter You think that you can knead and wedge me? A day will come When I will knead and wedge you The clay tells the potter You think that you can knead and wedge me? A day will come When I will knead and wedge you A leaf fell from the branch The wind swept it far away A leaf fell from the branch The wind swept it far away If we are parted now when do we meet again? Long is our journey ahead In sorrow everyone remembers the Lord But never in joy Those who remember the Lord in joy Sorrow will never be theirs Sorrow will never be theirs Those who come, will go one day Be you king, saint or pauper Those who come, will go one day Be you king, saint or pauper Some will fly away in a heavenly chariot Others will be tied down in chains I won't go alone. Come with me. Amma, tell me. How can I leave Siya right now? We fed her as a baby. Now her father is no more. I can't forget what happened to my father. No one stood by him. You tell me. What would my father have done in my place? Would he have abandoned her? Look, Amma, if you stay here, the Pratap Singh brothers will destroy us. You're only going to your brother's. As soon as things calm down here, I'll bring you back. Look after yourself. Does he want to work? Or doesn't he? They'll lose us money. Fire him and get someone else. Let's go. What is it, sir? - I have an arrest warrant. - An arrest warrant? I'm on bail. Grab hold of him! - Sinha, you can't arrest me. - Explain it to him. Bachchan, wait. Talk to his lawyer first. - Talk at the station. - What are you doing, Sinha? - What is this? - I have a warrant for you, too. - A warrant? - Yes. Why are you mistreating me? Keep walking. Hello? This is Arunoday Pratap Singh. Don't you get it? You're a *****. Why are you messing with *******? Didn't you see what happened to Shankar Singh? Have you forgotten what happened to your father? Or should I remind you? Are you Jagdish Singh? We're going to the Raebareli police station. Your old arms case has been reopened. - But that was closed. - Not anymore. I've done nothing. They are framing me. Daddu is behind all this. Call Mahender. Call Mahender. There's still time. Save yourself. Or you'll be to blame for whatever happens now. Your house, your mother and you. No one will be spared. Got it? Councillor, we are with you! Councillor, we are with you! - CBI... - Down with! - CBI... - Down with! - Councillor... - Long live! Councillor, we are with you! - CBI... - Down with! Calm down, my brothers. Quiet! The CBI can never understand the bond that unites us. I have toiled and sweated for you for the past 20 years. If the times demand it, I know you'll shed your blood for me without the slightest hesitation. For the time being, a combination of hostile planets rule Devganj's horoscope. Stay calm and let the law take its course. Because you and I both want justice. And justice will prevail. It shall be done on Devganj's soil, in full view. Let us be patient and cooperate with the judiciary. Thank you. - Councillor... - Long live! - Councillor... - Long live! Councillor, we are with you! My statement. File it away. You haven't visited me. You must come someday. We've been tricked. They're holding you in police custody for 14 days. Holding whom? You, sir. You may leave now, sir. The Councillor will stay here as our guest. Where is the Councillor? Siya, Arunoday Singh must be punished. Don't worry, we're here with you. We won't leave your side. All right? Shefali. Sir, we are ready for the recreation. Sita, did you go through here? Can you tell us in detail? Not through here. I took the back road. I didn't want mummy to find out. Come here. - Piyush. - Yeah? Can you come and have a look at this? Check there. - Let's send this for DNA tracing. - Just look at it. My car has broken. Please buy me two cars. Come, Siya. We must go. Mother, I'll be back soon. Everything will be all right. Take care. How long will we be? - 6 or 7 hours. - Be good, children. Sister, come back soon. I'm here. They're going out. They'll be back this evening. Don't worry. Your granny is right here. It's very late. We must get to the village before nightfall. Come. Hello? Yes, Pinto. We'll return the car in two days. We're leaving the village tomorrow. I don't understand anything. I think they'll kill my husband too. Be brave, sister-in-law. Nothing will happen. We will get justice. What's the use of getting justice when none of us will live to see it done? Come. Hurry. Quick. Be careful. She is bleeding. Come on, bring her inside. Get the OT Ready. Easy. Today is the 11th day of the Devganj rape case. The victim is still in a coma while the CBI enquiry is ongoing. The victim is still in a coma while the CBI enquiry is ongoing. Her parents and her greatest supporter, the lawyer Mahender Bhalla are dead. The whole country is watching this girl's suffering. She is in a critical condition. Chances of survival are slim.
