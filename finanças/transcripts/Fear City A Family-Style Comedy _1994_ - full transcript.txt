He said, ''Let it ride!'' What a feeIing! To read about my fiIm in the papers! I can stiII hear him! ''Let it ride!'' A reaI capricorn. I'm a press agent. So of course I Iove the press. We never used the R.V. anyway. Somebody had to get kiIIed for them to spiII some ink! IncredibIe! It wasn't much ink. Just one paper. We never used the R.V. WeII, one time. No, two. Who couId they interview anyway? The director's in an asyIum. The producer's in prison. The star... He must be free. He hasn't worked since. We never used it. It was in the garage for months, gathering dust. If I have him whacked, it'II whip up interest. Body guards. The whoIe bit! I can just see the headIines.

I knew the usherette. It's who you know, hunh? I don't know anyone. OK. We'II take the room. CIean it up a IittIe. At these prices that's the Ieast you couId do! You mind giving me an autograph? It's for my sister, Edwige. ''For.'' You wrote ''fur.'' Not ''H''. It's Edwige with an ''E''. Not ''EE''. It's an ''I''. Good. And an ''E'' at the end. But you forgot to sign. The key. Simon, about the beds, shouId we fIip for it? So I'II take this one. I'm reaI happy. - What happened? - Is there any progress? This is the 2nd murder in this theater. Is the movie that bad? Let us do our jobs. As soon as we know anything, we'II inform you right away. Is it a seriaI kiIIer? Are the festivaI-goers in danger? Let us do our jobs. As soon as we know anything, we'II inform you... Är det en seriaI kiIIer som fiImfestivaIbesökarna har att frukta? Lat poIisen göra sitt jobb... ...jag kommer att informera sa fort jag vet mera. BiaIes is sporting a siIk & wooI doubIe-breasted suit, 6 buttons... ...with shirt and tie in a CaIder-Iike pattern. You caIIed the press? Nice going! No, Det. It was the Iady who found the body. OdiIe Deray. The victim was kiIIed with a hammer and pickIe. No, a sickIe. WeII that's what the Iab guys think. Sure Iooks Iike ''pickIe,'' no? Any other cIues? The kiIIer scratched a 2nd Ietter in the waII. That makes ''O D''. We have the ScrabbIe team on it. Like Do Re Mi. Must be a musician. This guy is a maniac. I hope you have a strong stomach. It's a butcher job in there. Where's the crime site? Over here. It was horribIe. Hiding in the corner, with those... ...eight big hairy feet and... This is OdiIe Deray, who discovered the body. Do you know Det. BiaIes? Born in 1 950 in the town of Oran, AIgeria... ...his mother was vaudeviIIe star, AIicia Lampero. His father, Maurice, was a gendarme. Patrick Humphrey Tiburce BiaIes was an onIy chiId. FortunateIy, his mother joined in his chiIdhood games... ...because Mr. BiaIes was rareIy at home. In 1 962... ...the BiaIes famiIy Ieft AIgeria... ...for Nice. Then they took a bus... ...to Cannes. Patrick was tweIve. Wanting to pIease both... ...his mother and father,.. ...he was torn between the stage... ...and the poIice. But... ...destiny decided for him because, in 1 968... ...during the May riots, his father died... ...his head stuck in a subway grating. So he took up the badge... ...and Ieft the trapeze behind. 1 97 1 . He finished 1 0th in the Nice PoIice Academy... ...with a B minus average, which doesn't suck. After soIving two mysteries, he got his goId badge. How many Ietters? Nine. PoIiceman. He won the regionaI pIayoffs of Letters and Numbers... ...and so was promoted... ...to Chief Detective of Cannes, the post he stiII occupies. Nice to meet you. We're friends of the body discoverer. AII right. Go ahead. Not you! No sneakers! Is Miss Deray here? She went to change. Then they took her to the station. That's very inconvenient. I got here 4 hours ago. They gave me this guy to protect. So I protect him. That's my job. Right. I understand. First he vomits in the car. ReaIIy disgusting. Who knows if it'II come cIean. Then, in the room, same thing. We had an appt. at a restaurant. He's hungry. And he ate nothing. He drank O.J. We wait. She doesn't come. See that? It's a Cin-a-thon! Right. A Cin-a-thon. So now what do I do with this guy? Yeah, I see. It's amazing. That's my 1 st reaI Cin-a-thon. Go take a cIoser Iook. So, anyway, she caIIs me. She says she discovered another body. So she'II be Iate. Right. So how Iong does it take to discover a body? What? 1 hour, 1 1 /2? Tops. Don't touch stuff. It's been over 2 hours. What am I supposed to do with him? Think of taking him to Aqua-SpIash? No. Hey, Simon, tomorrow we go to Aqua-SpIash. There's the orange juice. I'm PhiIippe Garcia and this is Dets. Sens and BesteI. It's my duty to inform you... ...this wiII aII be fiImed. No, Detective. The thingamajig is busted. BesteI fucked the whoIe thing up. It's my duty to inform you, this wiII aII be not fiImed. Miss Deray, you can't eat frankfurters in here. NO EATING FRANKS What are you going to do? Lock me up for frank eatery? TeII us about your reIationship to the victims... ...Mr. Jacques and... what's the other guy's name? MireiIIe. I hired them and then they died. So it's the 2nd murder... ...invoIving this fiIm. Right. Good for pubIicity. And your job is whipping interest for the fiIm. Am I mistaken? Yes, ''whipping interest''. It's ''whipping up interest''. Let's not get picky. You think I'm stupid enough to kiII peopIe Iike in my fiIm... ...so it'II be more successfuI? No one said you were stupid. I did, at first. But now I think you're wonderfuI. I didn't kiII them, if that's what you're thinking. I'II take a Iie detector test. Why not? We can't, boss. BesteI was trying something, hooked it to his C.B. and it went... AII right, aII right. Don't Ieave Cannes for a whiIe. I have no intention of Ieaving. With aII that's happened, I've got work to do. I was at the Cameo. Look what we found. A finger. No, I'm kidding. This is what we found. Fabric? What couId that be? Fabric has existed... ...since ancient times. It's estimated that it was invented about a Iong time ago, B.C. ''The ant is no Iender,'' as La Fontaine said. Back on the nationaI front, and the murder of the Green Rep... J.P. Martoni has been indicted... but the N.R.P. Ieader can't be found, despite numerous court summons. Our correspondant, Jacques IzdeIebrouf. We seem to have a sIight technicaI probIem.

Ready Simon? AII decked out? Right. I'd better do something. TOOLS AND MACHINERY You know Christine, from cosmetics? The one with the pimpIes? Yeah, the ugIy one. She found a man. She didn't! I swear. She gets him home, on the couch... ...and she comes back 5 mins. Iater, naked, says, ''What's your pIeasure?'' And what did he do? He beat it out of there. So I toId her, next time be romantic. We're starting. So the next time, she's going to take a bath... ...so she won't go naked; she wraps the quiIt around her. And the guy froze his baIIs off? So the quiIt gets caught in the door. So to get Ioose, she drops the quiIt. And he says,.. ...''It's onIy ceIIuIite. I Iove you just the way you are.'' UnbeIievabIe! I swear! This is her first boyfriend. - With those pimpIes - - You're not interested? The two in the back, not interested? Sure we are. I'II repeat it for you. After the screening, you'II have Q&A with Simon Jeremi... ...the star of Red is Dead. Of course, I've provided a Iist of the kiIIer's victims. The reaI kiIIer, not the one in the movie.

He has everything they describe in F.B.I. studies. For exampIe? Everything. The cIose-cut suits, the haughty attitude... ...those skinny fingers... ...the way he says, ''Let the poIice do their job''... ReIax, Kara! I'm reIaxed. A piece of potatoe there. You can't know how a woman feeIs when a man disappoints her. How do we catch BiaIes? I thought of a giant booby trap... ...with a big piece of cheese. The kiIIer sees... Quiet! Here he is! EmiIe! EmiIe Gravier, our projectionist,.. ...Simon Jeremi, star of Red is Dead... ...and Serge Karamazov, in charge of your security. You haven't changed, EmiIe. How Iong has it been? 1 6 years, 8 months, 21 days... ...4 hours... 37 minutes. It was a Tuesday. Been a whiIe! I was working at ''Mustard & Movies.'' In Dijon. That's where I met OdiIe. We were a heII of a team. Who was it? There was... ...there was Henri... And the taII one. André. No, the taII one! - André. - No, the taII one! And IittIe SyIvie. We had some Iaughs! And the mother... SyIvie's mother was a baker. And she had a bakery on the corner of MicheI and DideIot. MicheI... ...or Pasteur? Anyway, so we aII get there, and her father... ...SyIvie's father's name was... ...PauI, and there was big André... ...no, Henri. Right OdiIe? What a guy! So the guy comes in and says, ''One Ioaf, pIease!'' In a butcher shop. I toId it wrong. You better go now. If you're working tonight... ...you'd better get a Iook at the machine. Kara, couId you take him to the center? Thanks, EmiIe. That's a Ioad off my head. 9 PM CANNES - The same day Cannes... ...has put on its finery tonight. Prestigious Cannes, fairy-taIe Cannes at the hour of great cinema! Right, CaroIe, if the weather hoIds out. Don't be pessimistic. The weather... ...wiII be fine. Here's the Lt. Gov.'s wife... ...escorted tonight by MickaëI, her youngest. Who's pretty grown up. Behind them... Bruno, of ''Bruno Shirts,'' one of Cannes' nicer stores. Over there! Iook! A star! I don't know who it is. I think I saw him in a movie. Or on TV, I think... No, CaroIe. I'm toId that's our Prime Minister. Right. I knew... ...I'd seen him on TV. I knew I'd seen that face. And here's Mrs. Jacques, widow of the first projectionist. She Iooks fabuIous... ...in her gorgeous ermine coat. An emotionaI moment. Yes it is, CaroIe. Without aII these murders, there'd be no party. So, a tribute... ...to one of those who made this magic possibIe. AII right, you can't get kiIIed on the steps. UnIess there's a Ione gunman, but I doubt it. No one in the aisIes. I want to see everyone's badge! There's a crowd. It's the red carpet. The FestivaI. Ever hear of it? Quite a crowd. Want some gum? Come on, have some gum. MUSTARD & MOVIES If you feII asIeep... ...you can see it again. There are other screenings. Come on, have some gum. You reaIIy dressed up tonight! It's for tonight. Our dinner date. You said we'd have dinner. So, since the festivaI's aImost over... I compIeteIy forgot! I'm going to a hop with my main squeeze. That's the 7th time you forgot. I'm so sorry. It's the festivaI. AII this pressure... I'm disappointed. You promised. I'm going to teII you something: You can't fooI one person a thousand times... Yes. You can fooI, uh... ...1 000 persons once,... uh... 1 000 times... No! You can fooI one time a thousand... You can't fooI once... ...a thousand peopIe. I got to go. Bye, EmiIe. ...a thousand times. Right. Bye, EmiIe. Bye, SyIvie. See you! Whatever happens to me you'II aIways be in my Iife. Everybody's waiting. It's time to go. OK, CaroIe. The crew of Red is Dead... ...has just arrived! IncIuding OdiIe Deray, press agent and... ...an insider. It's hard to get an invitation so it must be an insider. We shouId say... ...no one's seen the movie. Have you? No. But stiII... ...Iet's be candid. There's no time to see movies when you have to... ...get your hair done, find a dress. You Iook very nice. Here's Det. BiaIes! BiaIes Iooks very eIegant in his tuxedo by... No brand names! His tuxedo by... ...No Brand Names, 8, av. de Ia CaIanque... ...in Antibes. Simon! Simon! Luc! His name is Simon. Simon! Get up here! I can't hoId them back! Here's the Lt. Gov.'s wife again! Serge! Corinne! Excited buzz! Excited buzz! Kara to Régis! The red button, Régis. Régis here. We need another suit, and quick. AII right. I'II get it. What size suit? And now I see... ...tonight's star, the up-and-coming 5th victim... ...the projectionist of tonight's fiIm. His name is EmiIe Gravier, that's aII we know. Here's Mrs. Martoni... ...wife of the senator-murderer, coming up the steps. She's seen someone. It's her husband! Wasn't he in prison? That's Martoni! Get him! AII the exits are bIocked. I have an invitation! - EmiIe, EmiIe! - Luc! Luc! EmiIe! His name is EmiIe! E x c u s e m e. D e t e c t i v e B i a I e s. H e r e a g a i n t h e L t . G o v . . . Stop, it's over. WE WANT OUR INVITATIONS BACK! Better caII the nurses! And you! Do something! AII these years, aII these deaths -- wasted! It isn't fair! I don't deserve this! I couId project the fiIm. You can? That's great! How? I'm a projectionist. NOW THERE'S A FORTUNATE COINCIDENCE! I wanted to be in movies, so my father said ''Actor,''... ...but I wanted to be projectionist, because I'm not reaIIy an actor. How much time you need? About ten mins. ought to do it. Kara, you have your trumpet? Now for once, do exactIy what I say, OK? I Iove this piece. Can you dance the carioca? It's not a fox-trot or a poIka It's very simpIe to do Just watch my feet and you'II see It's not a tango or a cha-cha And it's sure no bossa nova Once you've Iearned, it's part of you. That's aII... ...you'II ever want to do. Hoo-rah! Let's dance the carioca That's the way! Just Iike me, it'II take youse far! Hoo-rah!

I'm so sorry. It's the fiIm. AII this pressure. Dad, some guys wouId kiII for this job. Don't cut me off. FeeIing better? This is my job. I know, I was just trying to heIp. It's you! But why? Because. - That's no reason. - Yes, it is. Want to know? A whiIe ago, I caIIed OdiIe to ask her for work. She didn't even know me. AII those promises, forgotten! That's why I kiIIed them. So she'd remember me. She made me a murderer. Look out behind you! You can't fooI me. You can fooI 1 ,000 peopIe 1 person but you can't... Yes, you can. You can't fooI 1 ,000 peopIe once... ...but you can fooI 1 ,000 peopIe once. Eat that, dirty communist! Watch out! Behind you! Idiot. That's the Iast reeI! I thought it was weird.

What happened? It was EmiIe. He's the kiIIer. He was caught by the giant booby. Listen,.. ...he isn't a booby, he's a poIice detective. So Patrick, you're innocent? You had doubts? At your house, the hammer, sickIe, the kiIIer's mask... I thought.. What did you think, exactIy? The truth is much simpIer. I was - how shaII I say... I'm a cop -- just a cop. My God, what a siIIy girI I've been. We've both been siIIy girIs. The Lt. Gov. wants you, on the direct Iine. Yes, your Honor? AII the exits are bIocked. Martoni can't get out. No. I onIy saw the beginning of the movie. The beginning was very good. WeII, I had some baIIet Iessons. Don't move! .. ...or she's dead. HoId on, your Honor. Who's that? Jean-PauI Martoni, a shady poIitician... ...an ecoIogist kiIIer... ...who wants to turn the beach into a parking Iot. Don't worry, OdiIe, I'II take care of this. Stop! Stay where you are!

No, this is Karamazov, I'm with security. We have a hostage situation. Det. BiaIes is badIy injured... ...and a girI with reaIIy bad make-up. A chopper in 1 0 mins., or she's dead. He wants a chopper in 1 0 mins., or she's dead. Says you're bIuffing. TeII him I'm out of knees. Says he's out of knees... He says, ''What's that got to do with it? Enough. I'm counting down. 5,4,3,2,1 and when I get to zero, boom! I'II bIow her brains out. He says, ''5,4,3,0, boom, brains.'' Confusing!? It Ioses in transIation. Five... Let's get the chopper.
