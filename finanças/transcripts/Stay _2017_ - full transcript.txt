I've always been a fan of nontraditional love stories, the ones where the characters receive exactly what they deserve. In a strange way, this is one of those stories. Looking back at things now, things aren't all that bad. But life here wasn't always this bright. - I should have warned you sooner. Please, don't scream. It won't come off that way. Please stop. Please don't. I know this is a strange introduction, but I want you to trust me. It does not have to be bad. My name is William, and you can call me Will if you like. Now the shock collar that you're wearing will not let you leave this place. Soon as you step through that door, it's gonna knock you on the ground with more electricity than the two shocks that you've already experienced. - What do you want? - I want you to listen. As long as you listen and do exactly what I say, this could actually be really pleasant for both of us. - Please. - That's not listening. That is talking. Huge difference. Stand up. Stand up. Thank you. Now give me a turn. Good. Now slower. Turn. Turn. Get on your knees. Crawl towards me. Stop. Sit up for me. That shirt's not right. Take it off. - Please. - I will let you talking and not listening go just this once but not again. - Please just - Take off your shirt. - No. - Please don't make me do that again. Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt. Is that the sound of someone waking up? Come on. Let's not pretend like I'm stupid. Now raise up your arms for me. Stop don't go out that door. I understand you're scared. New place, new rules all you wanna do is run. But I'm telling you if you go out that door, it would really, really hurt. I don't want that to happen to you. - Fuck you. - I am not lying to you. I don't wanna build a relationship on lies. - I'm leaving. - I warned you. I'm telling you, you don't wanna go out that. I told you not to try to go outside. I know this is hard, but try and get some sleep you'll need it. - Let me go. - Get some sleep. - Just let me go. - No. Please, stop struggling. You're awake. I let you sleep in. It's your first night I know that it's stressful. I'll be right back. Stay. Don't. I don't wanna have to use the collar. Okay, so let's start your day. Come on. Said I didn't wanna use it. Please listen. Come. This is the bathroom should you need it. Yes. Now rent is never free, so while you live here, you're going to have some tasks. - I don't wanna live here. - Homeless don't wanna live in tents. So, for the foreseeable future mi casa es su casa. What was I talking about? Tasks. I expect you to clean every day. You sweep, you dust, you mop? I like a clean house. I don't want you to be bored, so would you rather be shackled up in there or be able to move about freely in here? Okay. It's okay. Cooking will also be a task of yours, so make yourself accustom with the kitchen. - I don't really know how to cook. - You'll learn. Sit with me. I know what you're thinking all work and no play. I got you something. Art supplies. I got you an easel too, so you can draw and paint and all of that whenever you have free time. And I'm also happy to get any kind of books or records or anything you want. - People are going to look for me. - You and I have never spoken before. We live in a city with almost four million people in it. My apartment is off the street. You can't see in the windows. So, they can look, but they're not gonna find you. It's okay. Get it out. But when you're done eggs are in the kitchen, bread is the bread box and the pans are in the cupboard next to the stove. You're not done. Draw. - I don't really know what to draw. - Draw. Stay. What's it gonna be? - Cards. - How come? - My friends and I would have poker nights once a month. Just drink and enjoy each other's company. - You'll miss that. If you move, you get buzzed. Unlock it. Unlock it. Are you the type to use smiley's? - What? - Just making a post on your behalf. Are you the type to use emoticons? - No. - Well, you are now. Going off the grid for a few weeks with the new beau, smiley face. - Why did you do that? - Well, if you're good, maybe we could have your friends over at some point. Now draw. Smells good. If you have time, be a dear and set the table. I'm gonna go get some candles from the closet. That's a beautiful meal. Would you like to start us off? No. No, not like that. Would you like to say grace? - No. - No. - No, thank you. - Come on there's so much to be thankful for. - I don't say grace. - Wrong. Now you do. Say it. - I don't know what to say. - This time, just this once I'm gonna start you off, okay. Look around. You have food. You have water. You have shelter. That's a lot more than a lot of people have, right? - Okay, dear God, thank you. - You don't have to thank God. You don't have to. You just say we give thanks. - We give thanks. Thank you for this food and this house. - Too good company. Perfect, now we can eat. You've had a long and eventful day. Let me clear the table. - Should I wait here? - If you'd like or you can continue to work on your drawing. Whatever makes you happy. - May I use the bathroom? - Of course. Are you decent? - No, not really. - What are you doing? - Nothing. - Don't lie to me where is it? - Where's what? - Everything was going fine. Dinner wasn't perfect but I didn't say anything. Do you know why? Because you and I were connecting finally. - I'm sorry. - Where is it? - Where's what? - Is this what you want? I want you to listen. It's called a shock collar that you're wearing. It will not let you leave this place. Now give me a turn. Now slow. Get on your knees. Crawl over here. Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt. Morning. Sorry about the alarm. That must have been annoying. Completely forgot about it. Well, now time for breakfast. Go ahead and get dressed. Groceries are in the kitchen. So I've been thinking. - Yes. - You need a bath. - I'm sorry. - No, don't do that. Don't apologize it's my fault really. - Okay. - Tonight I'm going to bathe you. - Can't I bathe myself? - No. You can't be trusted yet, and that collar has to come off in order for you to take a bath. - I can be trusted, I promise. - I wish you could. What's the problem anyway? I never forced myself on you, have I? No, I haven't hurt you unless you broke the rules. I give you everything that I can within the limits, so what is it? - You haven't touched me yet. It's all I have left. - Calm. It'll be no worse than this. I'm not hurting you. I'm gentle. I'm not gonna force myself on you in the way that you're afraid, okay. That's not how I want things. - Please. - I've spoken, and we're not gonna discuss it again, all right. Tonight you get a bath. - This isn't going to end happily you have to know that, right? - Yes, it will. - No, it won't. You can't be that delusional. - I'm done with the subject, Claire. I told you how this is gonna end. - You can't just be done with the subject. - I said I'm done. - This isn't happiness. Let me go. - Claire. Stop. - Please. - That's enough time for your bath. Stand. Go ahead and draw a bath. I'm gonna light some candles. It's not to set a mood. It's just to lower the light. Maybe make you feel a bit more comfortable about this whole thing. Come here. There you go. Now your clothes. - Will you turn around? - Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay. Okay. - I can do this. - Relax. - It's not easy. - Close your eyes it'll help. Okay. This doesn't hurt too much, does it? I hope it doesn't. You see. That wasn't so bad. - Will you turn around again? - Sure. - Would you hand me a towel? - I think tonight was a really good exercise in trust. It really went well. Things can end happily you just can't see it yet. Come here. No breakfast this morning. No time. After last night I need to run some errands. Come with me. That should do it. I'll be back this afternoon. - Help. - William. - Rick, what can I do for you? - Hey, I just wanted to let you know I heard some banging coming from your apartment. I think there's something up with your pipes. - Really. - Yeah. - I had no idea. I haven't heard anything. Okay, yeah, I'll check it out. I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You'll be happy to know that my neighbor Rick heard you banging on the pipe. You got his attention, so I have to take care of that. - Take care of. - Take care of. Where's the trust, Claire? Your actions are forcing my hand. Here. - That's my sister. - Mother. Father. Everyone that you're close to I can get close to. Now I have the option of using them against you if I must. Must I? - Please. - Don't you see that you're forcing my hand? Do you understand that? The harder you push, the harder I have to push back. I don't want this. It's not me. Please think about it. I have to go take care of my neighbor. Time to get up, sleepy head. Good morning. No good morning. - Good morning. - Do you remember your first night here? - Vividly. - Me too. I want you to listen. As long as you listen, do exactly as I tell you, this could actually be really pleasant for both of us. Stand. Thank you. Give me a turn. You remembered that I wanted you to turn slowly. Get on your knees. Crawl. Stop. Stand. - Should I take my shirt off? That's what you asked for next on the first night. - No. No. Leave it on. You can go back to your drawing. You're unhappy. - Yes. - I'm sorry. - Me too. - Why are you sorry? - I'm doing everything you want. At least one of us should be happy. - What did you do? What'd you do? Claire, what the hell did you do? Stop it, stop it, Claire. Stop it now, stop it. Stop it. Milk. Stop it, stay there, Claire. Drink. God dammit, come on, come on. Stop it. Stop it. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink. Drink, Claire. Come on. Claire, come on. Drink. You need to eat. Come on. Come on. Come on. This isn't working. I'm sorry that you're so upset. - Then... Then let me go. - I can't do that. - You can. - No that I can't. - I don't know where we are. I won't be able to find my way back. - You know what I look like. - I won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone, alright? - You know that I can't let you go. - What do you want? - I want you to try and make this work. Because I'm not that bad. I'm not. There're a lot worse out there. I want you to flourish. - By keeping me captive you can't stop me. I'll hang myself with my restraints. I'll walk out the door and electrocute myself. I'll slit my wrists with your plastic forks if I have to. - Fine. If you wanna leave, you can leave. - Really. - Yeah. Yeah, you can leave in a month. - A month? - Yeah. You give me one month where you're not trying to kill me, you're not trying to escape, you're not trying to kill yourself one month where I don't have to worry about you. I can just enjoy your company. You give me one month then you can leave. - One month. - That's it just one month. - Okay. - Okay. Do you wanna play a game or something? - What did you have in mind? - Strip poker. I'm sorry that was a joke. That wasn't funny. I'm not funny. I never really have been. I always try but I rarely succeed. I'm really nervous. - Why don't you have a TV? - I just find it more distracting than anything. Honestly, I'd rather connect with you. Be nice to see you smile. Shit. I know what it's like. I do know what it's like to wanna kill yourself. I think everybody contemplates it at one moment or another. You're lucky you've seen the other side of it. - I didn't. I didn't actually wanna die. It was just in the moment. I regretted it as soon as I did it. It just felt like I had to go through with it. - That was the most frightened I've ever been. - Me too. Funny that the guy that caused me to do it is the one that ended up saving me. - That thought is what finally made you smile. I know that taking you was wrong, is wrong. I knew it as soon as I did it. Similar to how you felt at that moment. Now I've started down this path. I have to continue it. - No, you don't. Just let me go. - I told you. I will let you go in a month. - Is that why you took me? - What? - Because you wanted to kill yourself. - You could say that. It was my plan before I saw you. I just couldn't man up to it. Well, now that you're up and about, back to the routine. Eggs and bacon sound really good today. - Really? You have one more month with me, and you're gonna make me work. - Our relationship hasn't changed. You still have tasks that exist, and I will insist that you do them I just... Now I hope I don't have to push the button. Really don't like it. - You can wear the collar, and I'll push the button. I think I'd like it. - What are you hungry for? - Doesn't matter. - No, what's your favorite breakfast food? - French toast and berries. - Make that instead. See, I can be a gentleman too. Got your chair, let you pick breakfast all that good stuff. My, this is good. Seriously never knew french toast could be that good. I really wanna make a go at this. What do you need? What do you want? - You know what I want. - Well, you can't have that. You can't leave, not for a month. So, what do you want for here? - How about a TV? - No. - Why ask me what I want if you're just gonna shoot it down? - Okay, okay. What else? - Maybe, something on the walls. - Not a fan all the all white. - It's a little drab. - Okay, so artwork. Tell you what. Anything that you draw, you can hang up. - Can I hang what you drew on the walls? - You saw that? - Yeah. - Whatever you want. - What was on the walls before? - Pictures. Things I couldn't have around anymore. What else, what else do you want? - Maybe chocolate. - Sure. - Wine. - Put that on the back burner, maybe but eventually down the line. Red or white? - Depends on what we're eating. Steak. - We could do steak. - Hard to eat steak with plastic. Maybe fish. - Fish is good. Stand. Now. Do you dance? - No. - It's okay. Just relax. - If I don't, am I shocked? - No. Claire. - Yes. What's this? - No doubt you're aware tomorrow is the end of our deal. One month and you're free. - You're really letting me go. - I told you I would. Unless you want me to keep you. - No. I miss my family and my friends I'm leaving. - I know. I know you do. That's what this is for. - What is it? - It's a dress and some jewelry. We're gonna have a dinner party. - Dinner party. - I have taken the liberty of inviting some of your friends over for dinner. - That wasn't a part of the deal. - Stop. Tonight I am your boyfriend. I used your phone to reach out to your friends Amy and Eric. They seem like a nice couple. You're close but you're not so close that they'll ask a ton of questions as to why you've been gone for so long. I told them that we'd just gotten back from a long vacation, and we're just looking for a relaxing night with friends. - This is too far. - Stop. Would you come and sit down please? Tomorrow you go free. But for now you still belong to me, and you will do as you're told. I don't think I have to tell you that if anything happens to me or if you clue them in or if you don't sell us as a couple, then bad things are gonna happen to you and your friends. - Please cancel this. - No. It's happening. Just a few hours before your friends arrive. Excited? - Nervous. - It's okay. You just stick to the back story that we came up with. It'll be a normal night. Now we can't have you wearing that when we have company. Lift your hair for me? You just let me take care of everything out here. I just want you to go have a nice long hot bath. Get ready. - By myself. - Yeah, of course. - Aren't you afraid I'll run. - I'm terrified. You look beautiful. - Thank you. - I never thought myself one for picking out women's clothes. - Honestly, you did well. - You know I always think people are lying when they say honestly. - Everything looks really nice. - You look really beautiful. - Thank you. - Give me a turn. - You know we were actually having a good moment. You ruined it, you know that right? - Yeah, I didn't expect you to turn, no collar. - No collar. - You ready? - No, not really. - Well, no choice on this one. - Hey. Sorry I didn't realize I was interrupting date night. - No, no of course not. Of course not. Rick, this is Claire. Claire, Rick. - Hey. Anyway, I got some of mail, so I was just dropping it off. - My gosh thank you so much. - Yeah, take care. - You too. - And it was nice to meet you. - You too. You told me you killed him. - I told you I took care of him. - I thought you killed him because of what I did. - I know, I know. - Do you? Where did you go that night? - Well, I did take care of him. I thanked him for watching over the place, and then we went out to the movies together. Then when I came back here, I rubbed some dirt on my hands and my shirt. - You let me sit in the bathroom all night feeling terrible for what I did. - I thought that you would be happy that I didn't actually kill him. - I am but I didn't wanna think you did it in the first place. - Look at us arguing like an old married couple. - Shut up. - That's them. Act normal. - Normal? - Yes. - No, I'm not doing this. - If you don't bad things are gonna happen to all of you, and you're not gonna be able to leave here. Hi, guys. - Hi. - Come on in. - Hi. - Hey you. - Good to see you. - Yeah. - Hi. - Amy. - Amy, pleasure to meet you I'm William. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm William. - Eric nice to meet you. - Eric, my gosh I've heard so much about you guys. - Thank you. - I hope good things. - Yeah, all good things. Claire, dear are you coming? Yeah, so come in, come in let's have a seat. So your timing is perfect dinner is just about ready. You two go ahead and sit down. - Can we help you with anything, Will? - No, no, of course not. You guys are guests. It's your first time here. Second, time I expect you to cook and clean. Not the first time though. Claire, you feeling alright? - Yeah. It's just been a crazy couple of weeks. - Traveling and all that. - Yeah, I can't wait to hear all about it. I hope you have pictures to show. - Yeah, definitely, definitely. So we're gonna go ahead and grab the food, and then just gossip the night away. - All right. - Will you get your shit together? - I haven't seen another person in months. What did you expect? This is why I wanted to cancel. What is that? - Whiskey. - You had whiskey. - Yes, I had whiskey the whole time here. Just take the edge off. Let the bullet jump in the deep end. - No, thank you. - Drink. - Everything smells really good. - A while ago you told me that you wanted steak and wine remember? So I made my famous brisket and paired it with a Cabernet. - Let's just get this over with. - Wow, it smells delicious. - Brisket pretty simple but my signature dish. - Well, it all smells amazing. - Right. I had no idea William was such a good cook. - Claire does most of the cooking. - To friends. - So, how did you two meet? - Would you like to tell the story, honey? - Sure. Well, for me it was just like it was meant to be. - My reaction was a little different. - Took me a while to get her to relax around me. - He was really pushy in the beginning. He actually kind of forced me into this. - God, anyway. No, it was, it was just like it was meant to be. I remember I was driving down the street, and I saw you walking there. She was wearing this little yellow dress. I just felt like I had known her forever, you know. Something snapped inside me, and I knew that I had to be with this girl. - That is beautiful. Our story is not so great. We met online. - I mean it doesn't matter where you met just as long as you make it work. - And some days it is work. - Yeah, what relationship, isn't though. Sometimes you just have to overlook the flaws. - Right, yeah. - Well, you two are so cute. Thank you for reaching out, Claire, and it's been too long. - Yeah. Yeah, it really has. Yeah, actually I did most of the artwork in the apartment. It's weird to admit, but William actually inspired a lot of these pieces. - You have a real talent. It's good that he pushes you. - He doesn't just push me. If I don't draw or paint, he shocks me. He really wanted me to draw. - No, look at that talent. You seem to be having a good time. - I am. This isn't that bad. - You seem to be a little drunk. - I am. It isn't that bad. - So, you two seem happy. - Do we? - Yeah, that boy loves you. Good for you. - You think. - Yeah. - So, what do you wanna play, guys and gals. Gin, poker? - Gin. - Wow, you are on fire. - It's my first time playing, I swear. - Yeah. - I promise it was. - No, really him and I have never played before. - One of Claire's first drawings was of all her friends sitting around and playing poker. So, it's nice to be part of it instead of just instead of just seeing it. - Well, I think we're done for the night. - Really, no, stay longer. - Yeah, stay. - No, I'm sorry we both have really early mornings. But another time for sure. - I hope so. - It was nice meeting you. - Absolutely. I can't believe that worked. - Right. I almost stabbed you earlier tonight. - Yeah, I saw that. - You know, I actually had a goodnight. - Claire, do I need to run? - What? - The note that you had did you give it to them? - No. - Why are you afraid? - You knew about the note. - Yes. Let me see it. - Happy. - Yeah. - I'm going to bed. - It's our last night. - Yeah. Is that really why you took me? You thought it was meant to be. - Stop. You're drunk. - You're okay with kidnapping me, but you draw the line at me being drunk. - I draw the line at choice some things in our relationship I had to make the choice for you, and some choices you have to make on your own when it's not me making it for you and certainly not alcohol. This is our last night together. I have to be honest with you now. I have to tell you everything. I haven't told you, but I used to be married. My wife looked exactly like you, exactly like you. She was everything to me. She was my whole purpose. She was taken away. Then my whole world was gone, but then I saw you. I saw you and it was my second chance at happiness. - You tried to replace her with me. - In the beginning, yes, I did. - That's why you made me do all those things that she used to do. - But this past month I got to know you. I got to know who you are. Claire. - You're the worst. - Our dance. I never danced with her. I found things that were just us, that were uniquely us. I know that I was wrong in the beginning I was, but I'm right now. Please, please don't hate me. - I'm sorry, William. I'm leaving tomorrow. - I'm so sorry, Claire. Good morning. - What is this? - Last meal together. I didn't know what to make, so I made everything. I have to tell you something. I love you. I know that you're leaving. But I don't want you to. I want you to stay. I know it hasn't been easy for you. I really should've done a lot things differently. I also know that you felt something too. - Why didn't you just ask me out? - I thought you would say no. - I don't think that I would have. - Listen. I want you to be mine, and I wanna be yours. So I got you a gift. - Don't put that back on me. - I'm not putting it on you. Under your napkin. The future is your choice. - I didn't tell you to move. Stand. Come. Stop. Give me a turn. Slower. Get on your knees. Crawl. Stop. This isn't love.
