On his way from Paris to Dakkar. World's and olympic champion! Devil on the bike. Death flight! Ha-ha-ha! Duck! Hey, stuntman. The way it looks, you need a new bike. What? I can help. Slow down a bit. Where are you going? Take a seat. They always called us "The children of Sun", our group, that is. When the war began, The circus was closed and we escaped to the east into the mountains to keep the dynasty alive. Everything was OK until the raiders turned up. Have you tried to fight back? We called the militia first, last year. Cleaner, HQ speaking, got contact? HQ, Cleaner speaking, contact is well. We're entering the valley, will be on the spot soon Over. If those freaks fight back, finish the fuckers. Yes, sir, we'll meet them well. Over. End of session. Good night, boys. What happened next? Everything was useless. Budulai always said we should fight. Who is Budulai? He was my elder brother. They killed him. HQ, HQ! Cleaner's here. We are under attack! And they robbed us of the ancient dagger called Jaguar's Talon. Our ancestors told that it contains the power of the Children of Sun. It looks like someone is hanging around. Give a light. - Here you are. - Put it here. Good morning. Is it chocolate?! Fresh and tasty. What the...? Who was he? Ivan Taiga. Who? Taiga? The same hard-to-catch Taiga. Nobody can catch him, then? Nobody's going to catch him. Over there. Can we beep? Of course. Hey, we came back and brought the company! We brought the gunfighters! Where are you all? Come out! Where have you hidden yourselves? You shouldn't be scared! We brought the gunfighters! We shall win now! I wouldn't call it a hearty welcome. Not a great floor but would do for dancing. Did you built everything with your own hands here? But of course, we did. Great welcoming party, dude. I wouldn't ask for more. It took you loads of time to get prepared, didn't it? You're right, we messed everything up. Children of Sun are scared of their own shadows. Their mood changes now as often as the local weather does. I like the place, though. Where's the shower? Upstairs... Fine, I'll stay. Help yourself, guys. Eat your full. I guess you're hungry after your journey. We got a long way to go... Stop! Give me the bottle back! I wish you choke on it. How do you like it? Shit. Help! Raiders are coming! Shut up! Where are they? Who saw them? - You tell us. - He ran that way. How did he look like? He was so.... big. And... scary-looking. With grenades at his belt. ..and wit a BIG gun in his hand! Right, he was on that roof. Not on the roof but near the car. Silence! You all listen to ME! I've come to protect you. - Is it clear? - Yes. We shall eliminate every living being within 100 km. - Is it clear? - Yes! So go home, everyone, and sit quiet... ..until I call you! One more thing. From now on the alcohol is prohibited. Bring all the hard drinks to the warehouse. You'll be responsible for gathering. Got it? Dismiss! No cheers, gentlemen! Let's go on with sampling. It's beautiful here and smells a special way. It's a high time for the visitors to turn up. Do you think we'll sack them all? We should finish that guy first... How-do-you-call-him? Skull. Right. Jonah! - Get on the watchtower and watch the road. - OK. Candy wrappers again... [They discuss the football match] Act as decided. Be quiet. Ok. Yah, quiet as mice. Petruha, follow me. Coming! They are coming! I see them. I see them. Where's my car? Who has taken my car? Watch out! Gotcha! Keep him. Help me. Tie him up with the rope! Move! We lost him... Keep his arms and hands. Through him into the cellar. Where did he turn up from? From the trunk. He messed up all our plans. What shall we do? If I'm not back untill midnight, bring the people away. Don't move! Frisk him! What a nice surprise. He doesn't look scary at all... And I've been told quite the other thing. Zhukovsky! Show the visitor into the hall. Why are you alone? I'd let everyone of you join us. How many of you are there? Leave the Children of Sun in peace. Margo, be so kind and bring some beer for me and my guest. Shall I shave the beard off? Zhukovsky, what d'you think? - Shall I? - No. Well, ok... Suppose, I'll leave them in peace. To the mercy of fate so to say. Let them die. But... Thank you. You've killed two pals of mine. How will we settle this? It's our business. Children of Sun have nothing to do with it. AKS74. In set with the underbarrel grenade-gun. GP... GP25. Great machine-gun. They don't make anything like this nowadays. Thanks. Say what do you want for it. The "Jaguar's Talon" dagger. Is that all? Let's fight in knives. What is going on? Ivan Taiga is going mad. Give me the mirror. Curb you temper! Drink. Now, have a look at this... Do you recognize? Who is it? Who is it? Do you recall? You're just tired, aren't you? Now you lie down and fell asleep. Free me. I'll do in the morning. Thanks. Is that Ivan Taiga a psycho? Don't say such things. He spent 2 years in captivity. Did they torture him? You shouldn't watch TV so much, Jonah. How was the journey? Tomorrow at 12 a.m. we're having the knives fight in the Death Valley. The place fits in. Jonah, bring my tools. Are you serious? I gave him my machine-gun. It's stupid. There'll be no shooting. Mary-Lynn! Yah? We'll need your car tomorrow. What's the problem then? You'd better stay here. No, I won't. I won't let anyone drive my little lady. Ok. Take me with you! I want to go with you. I tell you, you won't. And I tell you, I shall. I'll take him. Death Valley. 12 a.m. Will they take us on the flanks? No, they won't, the slopes are too steep The bike won't go. will they through stones in us? Mary-Lynn! Drive the car into the shelter. What if there will be many of them? Who? Look here. - What is it? - The paralysing gas. Will anybody explain me, what is going on here? Have we come for a picnic? Ask the chief. 2 a.m. Jonah, Is there some other road from here? Yes, it is over that mountain. Shit. Kill the engine. Guns down. Just look at them! Honest gentlemen. Come on. Ok, I trust you. Now you. Here... So, on knives, sweety? And where's the soldier? Bring the oldman. Where's you psycho soldier? There's nobody here. Get lost! Sign: "China, 50 km ->" Those dwarfs are bastards. They have chests full of vodka but pretend they're poor. Shut up! They are rovers like you are. Let me go. I want to know who'll pay for my limo?! You've been paid your contract money. This? You can have it. Watch when driving, motherfucker! You walk very fast. I've hardly caught up with you. Our boss is tough but fair. We won't take other people's things. Sign: "Hi, Mommy" Did he make up his mind to come back? It's no surprise to me. I'll go, too. Those fuckers can scratch my car! She's right. I'll teach them to ride bikes. I can't help being sorry for them. It's a pity to leave so many things behind! We have to leave. If we stay, we'll die. It doesn't make the difference where to die. Have you thought about where we're going to spend the winter? It looks like our people are soon to vanish... Someone's coming! Hush! Hello, Jonah. We are back. What is wrong with you? We were told to leave. Or we'll be slaughtered. I wish I die soon, to end my tortures. I'm afraid, though, the other world will be no better. There're no such things there. There are no wars,no sufferings, no bandits in paradize... Stop lying! Have you been in the other world?! Why are you shouting?! Because I hate the ditherers! I like brave desperate guys! Save your energy until the day the raiders will come on. Fuck you... So, all right. You can go. I don't need anyone. Get lost, you all! Even dogs live better lives than we do. Hey! Go kill yourself. You all go kill yourselves. Go away! I don't want to see you anymore! Leave me alone! Raiders! Raiders! Switch off the light. Take you places, everyone. Stuntman, you've got the first guy. May be knives will be better? Ups... I've torn almost new jeans. Mary-Lynn! The contract is in effect. I agree for 30%. Ok, ok, 25%. Why did you slaughter the fowls? We didn't. Raiders did. 15%. Jaguar's Talon? Where did you get it from? Skull said he was sorry and told, to give it to you with his best wishes. Have a nice journey, Mohicans. Now we'll have some tea and go to bed... It will snow soon. - May we stay? - Let's stay. Come to you senses, Children of Sun! Right, our champions have come back. - Of course! - Right! - Yes. Have you forgotten the raiders? We got one gang here, but, surely, there will be another one in other place. The bandit you know is better than the bandit you don't. Switch on the illumination! Two roads lead here: one through the mountain pass, another - along the old river bed. The forbidding rocks enclose the other three sides. Where would you attack from? From the river bed, of course. The mountain road is way too open for gunfire. You're right, but our enemy is too self-confident. They attacked in front first. And when fighted back, they shall try a turning movement. When was this gun used for the last time, I wonder? It would do to hunt some sparrows. How come I didn't know you're sucn an expert? Well, we can find something more handy. Are you sure? Shall we build a barricade? No. The mouse trap must have a door. I told you get a heavy stick! You look like an Indian! I shall kill Skull! All right. But first you got to learn some things a good commander should know. What do you mean? Take the box away. Have a look at this. Here's the group of bikers moving along the road. Where their commander should be? Leading the group, shouldn't he? Right. Now they confront the enemies. Where their leader should be now? Should he lead? He should be in the center. The fighters form the avanguard and the flanks. Their squad is attacking. Where's the commander? Where's the commander? In the center? He is behind the lines, watching the battle and commanding. The defeated enemies are fleeing in panic Where's the commander? Is he behind the lines? No, he isn't. He's leading his squad again. He's catching up with the enemies and finishing them. You should have watched more old movies. Have you ever watched some?. Nope. Well, ok. Now the main problem is when is the commander more vulnerable? On the road, isn't he? Then during the battle. They can round him up and kill. You're wrong. He's an easy prey when he is chasing you. This is the crucial war art. Remember, war is a quick business. Where's the lock? - Swapped for a drink? - No, the gun was always this way. Take this. So... what are these mushrooms? Any problems? We've run out of bullets. And cans? Wow! Any questions? No questions? Go on practicing. Bullying the little ones, eh? Follow me. It hurts! Let me go! People are too relaxed. we haven't seen the raiders for 2 weeks. They say, the raiders will never come up again. I wish it were true. The last warm days. I'd like the time to stop. Sorry? Winter's coming. I hate winter. Do you like me? You're the most beautiful girl I've seen. Am I? You know, I'm a country girl. What's wrong? The advanced point. We have to hurry and warn our people! It's too late. Try to hit him. Here! Die, you fucking bastard! What are you doing! Throw this at him! Great! I got him! We got him! Look, another one! Don't waste the cartridges! what shall we do with him? what are you drawing there? An ass? No, some other thing. Red and hot thing. Don't peep! Go. Stop! No hurry. The captive said, Skull had left for some negotiations. Shall we pay a visit? We can't leave the town behind. You can keep sitting and waiting but I won't get blisters on my ass! Good bye, Petruha. A little squad can hold this point for quite a long time. Yes. We're ready! If so, take your positions. - Where will they attack? - I guess, in the small hours. They won't kill an elephant from the 8 steps distance. They have you. I believe, you really mean to play this war game, don't you? Could you please tell me what for? This is what I'm trying to understand myself. Well, right. Idiots. The whole band is out to chase Skull. Whom shall I fight then? Now, let's start the show... Password? "King's on the nightpot". Are you cold? We'll be warmer under the blanket. What did he say? He said, he had seen a man on the rocks. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... ???????????! Let there be light, said the electrician. The firemen have come... Move! Follow the plan, no improvizations! Squad A, follow me! Did you need our help to eliminate this shit of a village? Couldn't you do it? Go on! Fire on command. Look! 10 to 1 on Ibrahim. Accepted. Ibrahim! Fire! Pull. Beat him up with your legs. Watch out! Yahoo! They're retreating. We won! Pick up the tropheys and retreat behind the second line of defensw. Move! Great job, Petruha. Everything goes as planned so far. Now they are to ram the gates with the truck. We must stop them. Can you hit the driver? No problem. I knew they'd turn. The turning move will take them 2 hours. We can have some rest meanwhile. Later this day... Who is it? Don't you recognize him? Ivan Taiga! Where are you going?! Halt! Fucking Nazi! We're tougher than you! Hide yourself now! Back away from the gates! Go to the shelter! Retreat! Get indoors, everyone! Go up! I'll draw them away. Try and get me alive, motherfuckers. Where are you going!? Sell my limo. Buy more corn and a tractor. I wish I could have one more look at the clouds... Mary-Lynn, don't die! Please! Don't die! Can you hear me? Don't cry, Jonah. I hate sods. Why are you so quiet? Come out, we'll talk. "Guardsman colors". You lured us into the trap! I've lost half of my men! I warned you it would be nothing like a picnic. Fuck you! We're leaving! You owe us a new truck! Come on. Losers. There's pulse. The freight is ours, more than a ton. Your share is 50%. Nice death. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! You're a very good shot. I've for a long time wanted to ask you, where are you from, cowboy? Would you like to tell me? You wouldn't... Still, I would like to offer you a very entertaining game for men. A cowboy once had seven brides, but only one of them was real. Make your guess. It's a kind of a roulette, pal. You should have watched more old movies, you, rover. When is the commander more vulnerable? The only show! On his way from Paris to Dakkar. World's and olympic champion! Devil on the bike. Death flight! Ha-ha-ha! Catch it! The only show! On his way from Paris to Dakkar. World's and olympic champion! Devil... Give them the limo back. Shit. The bastard got too much blood... I shall find you. You will, Jonah. But your people need you right now. You have to seed the corn. Go to them. The day is yours, celebrate it. Russian subtitles by Eazin English subtitles by steelhawk?
