SOPPANA SUNDARI Excuse me, sir! -Hi, Naresh! Come in. -Hi, sir! -Come in. Thank you, sir! -Please sit! All our showrooms had good sales for Akshaya Tritiya. As many as one and a half lakh people have bought jewels and participated in the contest. -Super, sir. -Five of them have won. Here are their details. None of them know they won the contest. I want you to surprise them with the prize. Their excitement, surprise… A few good words about the shop and something about the collection here… I want a video capturing all these. Thank you, sir. We'll make sure it's unique. -All the very best! -Thank you, sir! Come on, let's go. Hi, sir! You've won a bike. Sorry, I've got an important meeting. Hand it over to the watchman. Let's go, driver! Give it to the watchman…? -Could you strike a pose? -Shut up, you! Thank you, sir! Anyone would do. I'll give it to them. At least call the maid, please! -Can't you understand? -Gosh! Come on, guys. Let's go. Hello, customers! On behalf of SGC Jewelers, we are distributing amazing prizes to customers who won the lucky draw! Now we are going to meet the next lucky prize winner. I'm as eager as you are. Come on, let's go! [phone rings] -Hello? -Hello, is it Agalya? Yes… I'm Naresh. You've won a lucky draw. To give you the prize-- Hello… You'll call me to say I've won the lucky draw and ask me to collect the prize. And then you'll launder money from me. -Sir, why are you irritating me? -Madam, madam… You don't have to come anywhere. I'm standing on your street. If you just tell me where your house is, I'll meet you in person. Please, madam! -Alright, come over. -Where is your house? Ask anyone for Agalya's house, and they'll direct you. Okay, madam. Hit a dead end? -Confirm! -Let's go. What a useless sidekick! Who were you talking to? It seems I've won a lucky draw. They're coming home to give it! Look at the state of this house. Do you think we can afford to buy lottery tickets? Lottery tickets don't exist here! You foolish mother! Then why are they giving prizes for nothing? There… they are almost here. Clarify it with them when they come. Go! Shall I go and find out? -Mom… Why are you doing this? -Selvi… Someone is calling you. Go check that! Give it to me. I'll add sugar myself. I don't even pay the principal, and this guy is asking for interest! Hey, wait up! I'm coming. I won't leave this place until you pay me. Are you playing games with me? Brother, where is Agalya's house? Hey, you! Didn't I tell you I'll pay once my daughter gets her salary? -But you're already here and screaming! -This is what you said yesterday as well. Some idiot is on his way to give a prize to my daughter. You come in the evening. He'll give a mixie or a grinder. I'll pinch it from my daughter and repay you. I'll come back in the evening. If you spin some story… -I'll show you then. -Get going! So, who are you? -Didn't you say an idiot is coming to give a prize? -Oh, yeah! -That's me. -Don't get too shocked! Don't mistake me. You are the God I pray to everyday. We are so lucky to have you here! We can manage these guys only if we smooth-talk them like this. But you aren't like them! You've come to give the prize. -Why have you come empty-handed? -No… -We want to have a look at your house. -Oh, with pleasure! -Welcome! Come in! -Let's go! -This is our palace. -Wow! Have a seat. -Would you like something to drink? -No, thanks! Are you looking for Agalya? -Yes! -She's drying clothes in the backyard. I'll go get her. Agalya dear… Is he dead or alive? Did we just walk into a house in mourning? What is he staring at? Who's that? I called him an idiot. -Tackle him. -Are you Agalya? That's not Agalya. That's her sister, Thaenmozhi. She's Agalya. -Hello, madam. -Hello. -You are? -We are from SGC Jewelers. You've won the contest conducted by the store. We're here to give it. -What's the prize? -For your purchase… Oh God! [sheepish chuckles] What is it? You want to pee or poop? Why now? He's driving me nuts. You never listened when I told you not to drink. Now you are bedridden and we are burdened with cleaning your mess. -She picked him up so casually. -Sir? What did you say the prize is? Actually… that's a surprise, madam. We want to keep it that way to film your reaction… …and make it grand. That's my job. Speaking of prizes, it'll be great to get a mixie worth five thousand. Why? Will you grind chutney only in a five thousand rupees mixie? Sir, when will you give it? We've brought the prize. If you wear something nice and get ready-- Are you gifting us with new clothes as well? -What's this? She's asking for new clothes. -Hold on, sir. We aren't giving any new clothes. You look nice in this dress. Just come along. Caught in the act! Who's Agalya? -I am. -Yeah, it's her. You have won a grand prize for your purchase at SGC Jewelers. And, how do you like our shop? -We always buy jewels only from SGC. -Wow! -That's like our family shop. -When did she buy jewelry? So, what do you think this gift would be? -Is it a TV? -God, please let it be a mixie. Tell me, ma'am. Any guesses about the prize? I'm positive it's a mixie. -The five thousand rupees mixie that Sneha endorses. -Yes… I'm sure it's that! -So ma'am wishes for a mixie worth five thousand rupees! -She's crazy about mixies! Alright, you tell me. What do you think it is? What is she going to say! Her guess is a mixie too! I want her to say it! -She's a mute! She can't talk. -Shut up! Who's that? Muniyamma, warn your son. Else I'll have to! Let it go, ma'am. You'll feel so happy when you look at the gift we have for you. Cheer girls, come on! Blindfold them. Here is your grand prize… A brand new car!

How come you've come to buy milk? You still have to pay for fifteen milk packets. When are you planning to? You better settle the tab. Otherwise, things will get ugly. Take this. Now leave. What is it? We weren't expecting you! It's all for good. Everyone in my family likes your daughter. We were surrounded by relatives the other day. It didn't feel right to ask what you'll do for your daughter in front of them. Isn't it good to discuss these things beforehand? What do you say? I understand… But… Our situation now… Wouldn't let us do much. We'll do what we can. Listen, we'll bear the marriage expenses. You don't have to worry about that. That's very generous. We never expected this from you! Wait. I'm not done talking. I heard you've won a car. Give it to my son. That'll do! You know where my son works and all about our family. I'm going to make them move out when they get married. Give it a thought and let me know. -That is… -What is it? With that car… -The car… -Keep quiet, Mom. -If you give that car to them… -Enough, Mom. Give us a minute. I'll be right back! Look, this is a very good alliance. And even my sister likes him. Give them what they want. What will you do if you give that car to them? I need to get you married too in the next two years. Even then some fellow will come and ask the same question. Mom, we'll talk about my future later! We don't even know if we'll be alive tomorrow. And, consider sister's age. She'll run out of options soon. Listen, Mom. Let's think this car was a godsend for her marriage. What's your younger daughter saying? Is she not interested in giving her car to my son? It's not what you think. She'll do anything for her sister. The car is no big deal. We're giving it to our girl, after all! That's good! I'll take leave now. Just a minute. We'll give you the car you asked for. But the marriage should take place on the next auspicious date. Next auspicious date? Mom, say okay. Please, Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom… Why are you still thinking? Okay. Mom… -I want to talk. -We're done. I want to talk to Thaen. He just wants to talk to the girl, alone. Let them go out and have a meal together! Let them drive there. There's nothing to be scared of. Send your younger daughter along. Okay. What happened? Aren't you going? Don't bother about that! He can't wait any longer. He'll lose his patience. Get going! Have a good time! My darling! Okay? Cheer up! I know everything! Get going! Look at you blush! Do you drive? Want to give it a try? It's easy. I can teach you. It's damn easy. I'll teach you. Come, I'll teach you. Sir, can't you drive any faster? Why are you so slow? If we rush, they'll think we are idle. We should look busy to everyone! Understand? That's true though. -Someone's calling. -Who is it? 6-3-8-1-0-400-48 -There's no name. -Give me my phone! It's just a number. Hello? Hello? Hello? -Hello. -Hello! -Am I talking to Naresh? -I can't hear you. -Yes. -Did you gift a car to a girl in the slums? -Yes, I did. -Come down to the Saidapet police station, son. -Is it? -Yes. -No, I'm busy… -What? Can I come by later? What? Later? -Okay, sir. -Is that so? That was awesome! So, who called? They called from some police station, sir. Police? -But why? -He asked if it was director Naresh… I replied "yes". He asked if you gifted it. I answered "yes" to that. He asked me to come right away since the inspector was waiting. Remember you told me to act busy all the time? So I told him to ask the inspector to wait. I told him I'm busy now and I'll drop by later. You idiot! Hey… -You said the inspector wanted to see me. -Yes. It might be something important. Sir, what did you just say? You just said we should look busy to everyone! But did you really have to say that to the police? Okay, then let's hurry. I don't want to be in their bad books! I've heard that the Saidapet Inspector is short tempered. Just thinking about it… What's your name? Agalya. Turn around. What? Just… Check the calendar over there and tell me the prediction for Libra. -What does it say? -"Regret." I do feel the regret… I can't attain what I want! Wait outside. I'll call you. Hey! Why have they wrecked the car? -Oh no! -Sir! Looks like a major problem! Yes, let's go have a look. Hey! Call the manager and tell him to come down to the station. Okay, sir. What's the problem? I'll tell you what happened! Who are you? I've never seen you before. This is my brother. Brother? I never saw him at your house! Their plan was to chase me away and nab everything! I'm ashamed to call you my son. Don't say it if you're ashamed! Sir, please step aside. -I want to talk to them. -Sir! There's no use talking to them. -They're frauds! -You are talking about fraud? -Hey, I'll-- -Sir… I'll talk to them. Step aside. What's all this confusion? You call him your brother… But he's lashing out! How is he involved in this problem? Hey! Hey! Take it slow. Slow down. Look… Drink this and be happy. Otherwise, make an issue and get it over with. Brother-in-law… My elder sister's prospective groom… What about him? -Turned… -Turned what? Turned down the marriage proposal. Dorai, we can't wait any longer. If we do, we can't walk with our heads held high. Remember. No. It's just that… I don't know what to do! What's the point of thinking about it now? You made a mistake before your sister's marriage. I can wait, Dorai. But can your child in my sister's womb wait? Look… Your family doesn't like me. I know that. It's my problem and I'll deal with it. You stay here. Tomorrow morning, I'm getting married to your sister. Okay? Hey! Damn! You're getting married to my sister. And that's that! Married?! -Mom! -Wait, I'm coming. Don't rush me! What? What has he done? He's gotten married before his sisters! My goodness! Dorai… Why did you act in haste? This is already too late. When is he supposed get married if he keeps waiting for your daughters' wedding? Hey. Don't you dare interfere in this! I'm talking to my brother. Yeah right! Yesterday, he was your brother… An hour back, he became my brother-in-law! We have every right… to interfere. Dorai, why do you let strangers interfere? He's asking the right questions. I don't have a say in this. Well said! Your son is married now. Welcome the new couple home! Let's discuss everything else inside. It's not courteous to keep us waiting outside. Would you do this if it were your daughter? We'd never elope and get married! Give me a break! My sister is smart. She married the guy she fell in love with. She's not a burden to her family, unlike you. Isn't it a secret wedding, if they don't inform the parents? It's not a secret wedding! The bride's family got them legally married in a temple! You should be thankful. Instead, all I hear is criticism! What's this? Why's she all silent? Brother, it looks like his mom is very hesitant to welcome us! -Yes! -Is it wrong if you do it? There are no wrongs, only rights! -Then do it! -Bring the plate. Coming right up! This is different! A man is welcoming them! What are we to make of this? Now look, sister… Split him up from the rest of this dumb family soon! You know what you're supposed to do. Smart girl. [chuckles] Go on. Pushpa! Open the door! Mom! She closes the door every morning, just to mess with me! She knows I go to work. Ask her what her problem is! Hey, Pushpa! -Don't do that. -Don't shout! You've even left the lights on! I said let go. Don't pinch me! [laughter] [moans] Watch out… The cot's going to break any minute now! I said let go! -They're knocking on the door! -Hey! Hey! What's up? At this hour…? Hey, can't you two keep it down? Do you think I got married just to keep it down? There are unmarried girls in the house! Don't you know how to behave? Aren't you a girl too? I should be asking that. When the girls can sleep peacefully… What's your problem? Or is it because your husband is bedridden… Are you jealous that you can't be like us? Or is it-- Hey, what happened?! Baby… How could you hit a woman? Didn't I tell you earlier? They're torturing me! Let's get out of here, baby! They'd kill you if we stayed here a minute longer! Baby, didn't you buy this mixie and cooker? I bought it! Don't forget it. -Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? -How could I? I paid for all this. -Give it to me. -Take this. They've managed to ruin everything you own. -Let's go! -Get going, get moving! Thank you, sir. -What are you doing here? -Why? Can I not shop here? Who? You? Can't you see? If you enter this contest… You might win a cooker! You and your mom can then sell idlis to make a living! See you around! You've won a lucky draw. To give you the prize­-- What's the prize? -They won a car? -Sister. What's all the fuss about? What's happening there? They bought some jewels and won a car as the grand prize! What is it? Why is he here now? Hey, Agalya. Come on out. -Hold on to your husband's hand. -Look at them! I'm not here to talk with you. I'm here to talk with Agalya! Let's not talk here, let's go inside. What is it? Tell us what you want and get lost. Don't ever come back! Give us what we're owed and we'll leave! Aren't you content with all the stuff your wife took when you left the house? Why? When your family gorged on my husband's money… Didn't you feel content then? As if we had a chance! You even took the cup that we used to clean the toilet! Don't act as if you owned a golden chalice and I stole it. Get a life! -You keep quiet. I'll deal with this. -Look at the way she's talking! Hey! I heard you won a car. Where is it? Just as I thought. I was wondering where the driver is. Not a driver, I'm here to drive it off. The car's mine! Go get the keys! I don't want to create any trouble. You thought I'd give away everything I own? How could you be so shameless and demand the car that was given to us! Don't you have a spine? We should be the ones saying that! My husband bought jewels at that shop. That car is rightfully ours! I don't know how you could live without an iota of shame! Don't you feel any shame for trying to take away what's ours! Your husband might have bought the jewels. I was the one who filled up the coupon and I won the car! Shut up and get lost. You just admitted that my husband bought the jewels. Hand over the keys and we'll be on our way! Hey, Dorai. I plan to sell the car to fund your sisters' wedding! You're making a huge mistake by listening to her. Why are you pleading to these people? That's ours. Hey! You're crossing the limit! How dare you disrespect us? -You better watch it! -Hey! That's all the respect you deserve! Get lost, moron! -Break into the car! -Okay. Open it! ♪ Let's see who wins! ♪ ♪ Don't try to pull tricks on us! ♪ ♪ Do or die, Let's fight it out! ♪ Get them! [screams] ♪ Work like a thief, But watch what you touch! ♪ ♪ Frame by frame, It's a perfect crime! ♪ ♪ It's the danger zone, Work with diligence! ♪ ♪ I'm gonna plan this And pull this off, no doubt! ♪ [sirens blare] What have you done? -Hey, Naresh. -Sir! -I was waiting for you. -Bring the file inside. Sir, he's the manager. Sir… What's the problem, sir? Hey, come here! You stand over here! What's the problem? Come on. Sir, he was the one who bought the jewels. How could you hand over the car to them? We hand over a coupon to those who shop at our store. They'll have to write a slogan about our store along with their name and address. We then award a prize to those who win the lucky draw. Did you fill in that coupon? No, sir. But I got the coupon. Who did you hand it over to? Her! She was at the shop. I gave it to her. You gave it to her? Did you go there to buy jewelry too? I've been working there for the past two years. He's used my name without my knowledge to buy jewels before! Is it? -Why does he use your name? -Sir… -I'll explain that-- -Hey! You keep quiet. You explain. You get a discount of 100 rupees per sovereign of gold if you are a relative of one of the employees at the store. That's the reason. -Is that so? -Yes, sir. Staff discount scheme. He bought jewels… and the coupon… You might win a cooker! You and your mom can then sell idlis for a living! See you around! You be the judge, sir. I could give up a pressure cooker. How could I give up a car worth ten lakhs? Sir, anyone can win the lucky draw. But we can only register the car in the name of the person on the bill. If he's bought the jewels, he must have the bill with him. Where is the bill, sir? I have it back home. You won that prize because she filled in the coupon. You better compensate them for their troubles! Especially since you say it's worth ten lakhs! Give her… One lakh rupees. Leave. Good heavens! At least we're getting one lakh! Okay, I'll give her the amount. Baby! The car is ours! Am I not your lucky charm? Hey, come on inside. Dorai, we'll pick up the car and we'll sell it for ten lakhs and we'll buy four used cars and start a business named "Baby Travels"! Great idea, isn't it? Why are you hesitating, Dorai? Come on! Could you keep quiet? What? Don't get shocked by what I'm about to say. I still haven't said it! I bought those jewels alright. But I didn't buy them for myself. -Nor do I have the bill. -Oh no! -What's he saying, brother? -What do you mean? I'm feeling dizzy! The car is worth ten lakhs! Don't you know that I flip goods I get during a sale for a commission? There was an oldie who traveled by my car and wanted my help and I bought it for him! You're getting a damn commission for the jewels! Couldn't you fill up a damn coupon? That is what really upsets me! -What? -I've never been to school as a child! I should've at least learned to write my name, but no! Damn you and your excuses! Does that oldie know that he's won a car? No. Do you know where he lives? I do. Show me where he lives. I'll take care of the rest! Hey, wasn't that policeman such a nice guy? He asked him to pay up at least one lakh! Let's be happy that we're getting a lakh out of this! Otherwise, we'd be left with nothing! They said the car must be handed over to whoever has the bill. Why are you whimpering now? We're getting one lakh! Thaen? So what if we don't have the car? I will somehow get you married. This isn't even a big deal. Why are you crying now? Why is she crying? What's wrong? Why are you crying? What's the matter, Thaen? Crying over petty things. Come in. Thaen, the car… -What's he doing now? -The car? Where is the car? The car has gone for a walk. Gone for a walk? Where is the car? The car… Oh, Thaen! The car is missing from the spot. Where is it? -I'm asking you. Answer me! -Hey… What happened? And why are you still crying? That… What is going on? You're hiding something. You better spill it out. Tell me what happened? I'm asking you, Thaen! Tell me! Will you spit it out or not? Thaen… Got it? Now press the accelerator slowly. Don't use the brakes. Press on the accelerator. Do it slowly. Don't be afraid. Release it smoothly. And let it go. Yes, that's it! Do you see it move? Do you? Keep going! That's the way to go! Switch the gear now. That's it. Increase the speed now. [chuckles] Drive faster. Go. Keep your eyes on the road and speed up. Can't you see? The police are heading this way. Give me a hand! The police are nearing, Thaen! Are you even listening to me? Come, give me a hand! Help me if you want a happy life together! Help me lift him up. I'll handle it, Thaen! You weren't driving. I was. Understood? Come on. I'll handle it. Hey, you. What's going on and what were you up to? -Get down and enquire. -Sir. What were you up to? I'm talking to you, sir! What are you doing here? I was teaching her to drive the car, sir. At this hour? You… get going. Get going! Thank you, sir. The morons I deal with. What was it? And who was he? He was teaching someone to drive. Alright, follow them. Thaen… Doesn't look like they're going to leave. We'll get caught! So, just for today… I'll come in the morning on the pretext of teaching you to drive and we'll dispose of the body then. Okay? Just for today. I'm saying this for our sake. Please. Thaen… You remember what I told you, right? Does the car have a cover? Is this the cover? Good thing this cover is like a blouse. It covers up every part. Keep this. I'll come back in the morning. I'm sure you're aware of our current situation. You didn't do it intentionally. So don't worry and don't be afraid. Keep an eye on the car. Okay? I'll be back in the morning! Agalya… I am freaking out now. The… The dead body… Is it in the car? [gasps] Save us, God. Oh gosh! Agalya… If Dorai gets that car, won't we all go to jail? He acted like he was a pauper. But when his wife asked, he immediately bought her jewels! That too, at the shop where you work! [sighs heavily] Why do bad things happen only to us? Hello, Ammu? Could you do me a favor? Hey… Where are you going? Look at the audacity of this drunkard! I will kill you! Agalya! Agalya! Agalya! -I have something important to-- -Move out of my way. The heck? Her mother doesn't give a damn about what I say. And she acts the same way! What a funny family this is! Fish! Fish! Hey. What happened? The gate's locked. I've informed Danger Boss about it. He's coming with the keys. I'm very tired, man. I'm in complete sleepy mode. I'm going to sleep. Are you afraid? Are you pretending to be asleep just to escape? I'm not a dunce, dude! Fine, show them who you are then! He's here, come on! Take these. Here. This has the details of the customer who bought the jewels. -Why do you have so many keys? -Why? I asked you to steal the bill and you're giving excuses? These keys open all locks. Go in when there is no one around. If not, the police will be on rounds. What if the cupboard's locked? It has keys that open anything, you imbecile! Come. Hey, Richie! -Where are you going? -To sleep. Sleep? Mom. -I was right. -About? It wasn't Dorai who bought the jewels. -Really? -He bought it for someone else. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have the bill. We must find a way to get the bill from the owner. You don't talk to them. -Come where I ask you to. -Listen to what I'm saying… Hey! Why did you switch on all the lights? The neighbors won't suspect and assume the owners are in. Confirm. Confirm! I can hear the television running. Dorai… Something's not right. I feel it's better to stand afar. Hop on! Didn't I warn you not to trust those dumb heads? -Where did your senses go? Look-- -Shut up. I'll be back, Mom. I'm tagging along! I don't trust you and your blabbermouth. You might blurt out something. Stay here. So many bills! Which one could it be? Why hasn't no one answered? The television's on… [knocks door] [phone rings] Hello? -Mom… -What happened? I don't think there's anyone inside. What do I do? Get in and grab that bill somehow! Mom! Did you just ask me to steal? Who cares! We're heading to jail anyway! Shall I choose the murder option then? We'd go in honorably. I will murder you myself! You better get that bill somehow. I'll keep an eye out if anyone's coming. Fine. Excuse me? Excuse me, sir? Excuse me! Why isn't no one around? Why is the house lit when no one's inside? [gasps] These fellows? -Bloody scoundrels. -Hello, boss! Did you find it? What kind of a bill is it and how do I find it? It's written. Check properly. It's written?! Why will I pester you if I knew how to read? Did you get inside without understanding what it was, you moron?! I'm sending you a photo. Stay there. Bring it when you see it. Actually, bring whatever is there! Cut the call, you imbecile. Alright, send it. Why does he yell like he's literate? How is stealing connected to literacy? My time will come someday… What the heck… Is that my phone vibrating? Message from Danger Boss! Ah, the photo. That's the bill? Oh no. I crushed and threw away something similar! Bunch of idiots… Open up! Open the door! What the heck? I threw it… …from there. It's missing now. I'm very sure the occupants are not in town, sir! Damn it! Who was that? Holy crap! Who locked the doors now? Oh gosh! I've locked them from the outside, sir! -Oh no! -You can nab them if you come quick! Richie… Richie… Richie… We're doomed! The police are here, Dorai! The police? Let's get out of here. Let's go. If not, we're doomed. Get going! Go! Oh my, she's stuck inside! Sir, sir! -It's a disgrace to my family. -So you want to rob a house? How will my mom feel if she sees me this way? I said we didn't loot anything from there. We aren't thieves, sir. So you didn't steal? -Sir? -Throw them in the car! -Sir? -What is it? There's another guy inside, sir! Sir? Sir! -Yes? -Is this your house? -Are you the tenant? -No! Who are you and why are you asleep here? Thief! A thief? -Yeah. -Meaning? A burglar. Get up, you scoundrel… -Let me go, sir. -How dare you sleep like it's your own house? Why are so many people coming out? There aren't any houses opposite. -Get in! -Sir, how could you listen to him… -Sir, we didn't do anything. -Shut up and get in! Why did you wake him up? Let us go! -Sir! -You want to nap during a robbery? It's you! I came to check on you. You would have given us away. -Where's the auto? -It's behind us. Turn around quickly. -She's leading me to the lions' den! -What is this for? -A disguise to escape from the police. -Why? Quietly sneak into the auto. And take that off! Sir, sir! Stop yelling. Start the car! -…you have the wrong information. -Got it, sir. What about the bill? You've picked up litter instead of the bill? Open it. I don't know how to read. I guess this is the bill. Let me give a vague smile… She's smiling… Which means this is it! What was so urgent that you wanted to see me? Listen… I'll get to the point. Dorai bought the jewels for someone else. And that inspector said he'd give the car if we have the bill. I know. I managed to… convince the owner somehow. Oh, really? Our bad luck… He lost the bill! He said we can take the car if we find the bill! -So generous! -Who is? The owner, obviously. It isn't an everyday thing to give away a car worth 10 lakhs. Yes yes! It is an incredible deed! But the problem here is… That man searched his house… and said he couldn't find the bill! -That is why… -Is it? I heard someone got caught by the police while searching for it. [indistinct chatter] -Tell us now! -Sir! -Answer us! -Sir! Wait, sir. We didn't go there to steal. But to find a bill! -What sort of a bill? -A jewelry receipt. What jewels? They told me that a car is the prize for that receipt. I was instructed to get that bill from an idiot claiming that prize! An idiot? -About that… -Listen. I think she knows everything. Alright, I don't wish to hide anything. My henchmen who went to get that bill, got caught by the police. And that inspector found out who the original owner is. What car are they referring to, constable? It's the same car that got into trouble last time. How did that bill get to that house? They assured me I'd get my share irrespective of who the real owner is. So I don't give a damn about it. Listen. They assured you only a lakh, Agalya. But we're giving you two lakhs! It will help with the wedding expenses. The one he bought the jewels for reported stolen… We went to that owner's house, sir. Does he have a name? -[stammers] Darai, sir. -What? Tell me clearly! Dorai! Dorai! What is with the sudden bouts of affection? I can get her married without a penny from you. Listen up. The car is now with the police because of us. Let's join hands and get the car out. Constable… Ask the original owner to show us the bill and retrieve their car! Whoever goes after it, put them in jail! I knew it. I knew you would say this when both of you stammered. Knowing that the car isn't yours and won't get a dime in return, you hatched this plan, right? That car doesn't belong to that fellow. Can I use this as an excuse to woo her? Alright. But I… …want five lakhs! The actual worth of the car is ten lakhs. Five lakhs for you and five lakhs for me. At least I'm splitting it with you equally out of pity. But if this was the owner… You wouldn't have gotten a single penny. But if you hatch another plan without my knowledge… I will tell everything to the owner myself. -Am I clear? -Nothing of that sort will happen. Equal share for all once the car is out. That's all. Okay… Click one like this. One like this. This will come out well. All good? Share my expressive photos on WhatsApp. -I hope nothing will go wrong. -Dorai, I know this in and out. -Why the hell have you clicked pictures without lighting? -Look at that! Sir… Can I rely on your acting? Hello… In Kollywood, after Ajith and Vijay… It's me, Vijith. Haven't you watched my films? You've acted in movies? -Yes. -Which movie? It's getting late. Inspector will leave for rounds. -You leave now. Go! -Gopi, did you tell something to her? -You should only know about her! -As if you are George Bush. -Hello. -What? Do you know how to drive a car? Not just a car, I can even drive an airplane. Don't you worry! Go and meet constable Subbaiah once you reach. He'll take care. Isn't he one of us? I'll take care. She's asking if I know how to drive a car. Can you even reach the accelerator? Is this what a police station looks like? A man is sitting there, like a monkey! Is this the car I need to pick up? I'm coming! Look at the way they've kept the bikes. They'll never change their ways. Who is this fellow? Why does it stink this bad? There should be a law to keep all vehicles at the station clean. Only then would they handle these vehicles properly. Hey, sir! -Come here! -Hey? Can't he walk any slower? What? Why is the car stinking? Won't you keep the car safe and clean? Do you think I'm running a car wash? That's how a seized car will look! So, you can't get the smell? Weren't you sitting there jobless? Can't you find out why the car is stinking? Alright, get me the keys. I haven't got it yet. Okay, go and get it. -Stay right here till I get the key. -Alright, just go. -Suffer the stink! -How dare he orders me? Let him bring the key. I'll deal with him then. [sniffing] He was right. The car is stinking! I shouldn't have worn tight jeans today. -Who is constable Subbaiah? -There he is. That's him? He's working sincerely. -Greetings, sir! -Is it a petty case, brother? I'm Tamizh. I've come to pick up the car. -Did you buy the jewels? -Yes, sir. Why did you buy those jewels? I heard buying jewels on Akshaya Tritiya will make it multiply. So, I purchased the jewels after borrowing money from my neighbor. But, nothing multiplied! How many sovereigns? Did you go to the store yourself? Ten sovereigns… But I didn't go in person. A call taxi driver told me he'll get a hundred rupees discount. So, I asked him to buy it. Good man! -Who? He's a good man? -Yes, of course! -Damn! Do you have the receipt? -Sure. -Show me. -Here it is. Take it! Tamizh… Kilpauk? Is he the guy? He doesn't sound genuine. Why is he looking at the bill and then at me? Will he find out? Sir! Who is responsible for the damage to the car? Very bad, sir! Will I be able to claim insurance for it? Why is he staring at me? Why has she sent a text? Did things work out? Why is he going out with the phone? Would he have a mistress? Highly likely! -Hello! -Hello? It's me. Who's "me"? Who is this? Inspector Kannan from the station. Tell me. What do you want? Will you give me anything I ask for? Just tell me what you want. You act like you don't know my intentions. You're so sly! I'm not that kind. Stop talking to me like this. I thought I'll give you some good news about that car. Your wish! -Shall I? -Hello? Go ahead, tell me. Please! Your brother hadn't bought those jewels. He has bought it for someone else. That person is sitting right in front of me. I'll talk to him and get him to compensate you in private. It would be nice if we meet before that. What do you say? I'm going through this only for my sister's marriage. I hope you understand! You are the one who needs to understand what's happening. There's no hurry! Let me know tomorrow. Okay? I'm damn sure he's spoken to his mistress! No wonder he's so happy. What's it, sir? You look happy! I can also go home happily if you give me the car keys. If I hand over the car to him… Then I would have nothing to hit on her. I've got to corner him. -Where are the jewels? -Jewels? Yes! Didn't I ask you to bring both the jewels and the receipt? They didn't give anything. Who? Damn, I should stop blurting out the truth! At my house. Look, anyone can make a fake ID if you pay. Wow, he's found the truth! I can't trust them to hand over the car. Don't you worry! The car would be right here. You can take the car after showing the jewels. Got it? Alright, sir. Take care of my car. I'll be back with the jewels. What's the point of staring at each other? You could have spun some tale and escaped! I didn't expect that policeman to ask for the jewels. What do we do now? That means you have to arrange for ten sovereigns. Only then will you get that car. That policeman wouldn't let me take the car unless he sees the jewels. We can't even make ends meet. Where are we going to find ten sovereigns? This is the right chance! Looks like we'll have to steal the car. How can we? Didn't you see your sister cry? They cannot arrange for the money by tomorrow. You keep quiet and just nod at everything I say. -Do something! -Listen… We'll need to come up with ten sovereigns of gold in two days. We'll split it as five sovereigns each. At today's prices, it costs five lakhs. You and I both have to pay two and a half lakh rupees each. If you can't come up with that amount, we'll pay the total amount and redeem the car. But your share will remain one lakh rupees only. -Are you blackmailing us? -Not at all. If we're going to share the profits from the car, we'll have to share the costs equally. Isn't that fair? He's leaving town in two days. It's his grandma's death anniversary. Grandma? I don't have one! Your grandma lived. But is dead now. I see, I see… I have a doubt. What's it? Isn't it a new car? Of course, it is. Then why is that car stinking like a dead body? Stinking like a dead body? What is he blabbering? I'm not. It's really smelling that bad. -You can go and smell it yourself. -Idiot! They had the car before it was taken to the station. Clarify it with them. -Who? Them? -Let's go! -Come on! -Hello… Hold on! -He's smelled a rat! -Come here you two. Why are they giving this blank stare? Why is that car stinking so bad? -That car-- -Stop. You continue. [whispering] We murdered someone and hid the corpse in the car's boot. That's the reason for the stink. Will you dispose of that dead body and get that car? Sounds like the story of a blockbuster movie. I'll deal with you later. -Oh gosh, that's the truth! -Mom… Look who's talking about the car, a dead body in it, and millions of money! -[whispering] Why, Mom? -He's dumb! Complete idiots! What is this lady doing? -Hey, lady. Come here! -Sir? What were you doing? I was sanitizing the place, sir. Why only for that car? -I was paid money for it. -By whom? Over there. They're standing by the tea shop. Sir, the constable asked her to do it because that car is stinking. How come it's stinking? It's a new car! Alright, go on! Thanks a lot, madam. See you! Come on, let's go. ♪ Life… ♪ Forget a lakh, I won't even lend you ten thousand. Brother… -Please… -Agalya. Just leave. ♪ If you try to live Without hurting anyone ♪ This is all I have.

We're trying to figure out a way to get one lakh by tomorrow… And you want to pee every hour! That man Pandi is the reason behind all this. -And that's him! -MOM! Why, Mom? He got me married to this drunkard because he wanted to drink. There's no use lamenting about it. Get it done with. Right, there's no use lamenting. A decision has to be made. Every time I open my mouth, it's a problem for everyone in this house. Hey, Agalya! Look at this. There's a five hundred rupee note in here. Mom, this is useless. Damn it, I thought only you are useless… Even your currency is useless! I'm coming, damn it! Hey! Don't do that. Be patient. Let's see if God shows us a way! Agalya, Dad fell down. Come here fast! -Don't just keep staring. Lift him. -What happened, Mom? Come on! -Selvi, what happened? -What is it? It's nothing. I have some important news to tell you. God, she's annoying. He might die! -Ask the auto driver to leave. -Let's go, brother. Hey, wait up! -She's jobless! -Why doesn't she ever listen to me? Mom… Don't worry! Dad will be alright. Have you brought him as discussed, Selvi? Where the hell did you go, moron? How long should we wait outside the hospital for you? I'm here now. Tell me. I trusted you. That doctor is asking me to take him home. How do you expect them to tell you explicitly? It's all arranged. Send me your account number, IFSC code, and other details. I'll take care. Just send it. The money will get credited to your account instantly. Who's that, Mom? Send those details. I'll fill you in later. That's his number. You want to keep it a secret. Fine! Just do as I say. Show me. Here, I've sent it. Spill it now. The thing is, I didn't feel anything good was going to happen. All that we had saved up is getting drained. Oh, Mom! Why are you talking about that now? I have a reason. That fellow just went. Looks like he's double-crossed me. One… One lakh rupees has got credited! You two wouldn't have accepted if I told you. I didn't have another option. So? So I carried him to the restroom and… And? What did you do, Mom? Don't make noise. It will be quick. [screams] I sold your dad's kidney for one lakh rupees! They are shocked. Am I going to get screamed at? Don't you think I'd want to see you two get married, have kids, and settle down? You want me to be enslaved to him for life? When he was healthy, he used to drink all the time and put us in a spot! Now that he's bedridden, I'm supposed to just take care of him? That's why I made up my mind. Mom?! Do you just realize what you've done? I don't care! I've done everything I can till now for the sake of marrying him! Hey! Stop! Where are you going? Don't do anything stupid! Ask her to wait. Ask her to stop first! Then you can say what you want! Are you asking if I sold just his kidney? Yes, I sold only the kidney. You can sell the eyes and the heart? We'd get a good amount? You never used to go near your dad as a kid. Even when he used to call you to play! I knew back then, that you didn't have any affection for him! I don't know what she has in store for me. Come along. You and your ideas! Damn it, I wonder what trouble she's gotten me into! Hey! What did you tell them? Can't you tell me when you're making a decision like this? I know you're more affectionate towards your dad than your sister! What if you object to this? What you did was right. You've sold it for just one lakh rupees in today's economy! So I negotiated for three lakhs and finalized the deal. How's that? Bunch of crooks! -Good thing I dropped your dad in the restroom! -What's the matter, Mom? -What's the matter? -Come along. One thing's certain. I'm definitely not as evil as you two! If not for me, you'd have sold him for parts! Why are the police waiting outside our house? -Quiet. -Did they figure out our plan? Shut up. What is it? -You're not attending my calls. -What do I do? You took the money, right? That belonged to the rightful owner! Who said it was his? That money belongs to me. I gave it for your sake. -Give it to me. -Hey! Hey! Wait. -Hold on to this. -Hey! Hey! Why is she walking away with the money? So you won't come? You better go back the way you came. Or I'll make a scene and humiliate you! -Start the car. -Okay, sir. Take this. -Keep this with you. -What's this for? It's the bill from the pawn shop. -You told him you pawned these, right? -Yes. Don't give him any other excuses. You've got to come back with the car! Understood? Here. I don't want this! Why? What if he gets suspicious that I've got everything ready? What would you do then? I didn't think of that! He's right. Fine, give it. I'll keep this. Is he mad? -I'm sure he's clueless. -Brother-in-law… Can he pull this off? I think he will. -Isn't Constable Subbaiah around? -I don't know. Are you always seated here? This is my job. Where else would I be? -Is the Inspector in? -He's in. Order a tea. I'll deal with you once I'm back. Tea? What a moron! -It became a huge problem! -Sir, may I come in? Oh, it's you? I've been waiting for you. Come on in. You've been waiting for me? That's alright. Why are you here? Have you forgotten already, sir? I'm here to pick up my car. I've borrowed money and recovered the jewels I'd mortgaged! Here, see for yourself. -Here, sir. -Why is he handing it to him? Why are you handing it over to him? Is he a Marwadi? I've never seen you around Sowcarpet before. Check all you want. It's original 916 Gold! So you don't know these people? Why should I bother? You wanted the jewels. I've given it! Hand over the car keys and I'll be on my way. -Duplicate. -What do you mean duplicate? -You… -Hey! Rascal! And this moron wants the car back! Didn't I warn you earlier? Fraudsters! Lodge a complaint against him! It's alright, sir. Let him go. Who wouldn't want a car worth ten lakhs? -Make a complaint for my sake. -Please don't force me. -He's the rightful owner? Looks like I'm trapped! -You don't seem to understand. -Constable? -Yes, sir! Here are the keys, sir. Here you are. -Thank you! -That's alright. -Get their signatures on the paperwork and send them off. -Yes, sir. Make sure you're handing over the gift to the right person next time. -Sure sir, sorry for the mistake. -Damn, it's our guy! He's caught! -We'll wrap up the paperwork outside, sir. -Okay. -Thank you, sir. -Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Looks like I'm dead meat now! I'll just put my head down. He's going to make me go deaf in the other ear too! What the hell is your name? -Vijith, sir. -Who sent you? The family fighting over the car. They sent me. What's that in your pocket? -Pawn shop receipt, sir. -A receipt? -Why do you have this? -Last time, you wanted me to bring the jewels. What if you wanted me to bring the receipt this time? That's why I printed it and brought it as a precaution. I'll deal with you once I'm back from the rounds. Stay here till I'm back. What's this? The inspector is leaving! Our man is inside. I don't know what's going on. Hey! Isn't he your manager at the jewel store? -Yes. -Thank you, Naresh. Thank you so much. The guy who's with him… Isn't he the guy who gave you the prize? -Why are they here? -Are they here to check the jewels? Wait. I'll call the constable. Sir, the inspector has left the station! The jewelry store manager is also here. What the hell is happening? The inspector found out that the guy you sent was a fraud. They brought along the rightful owner. Take care of it! What happened? The guy we sent got caught. Oh, no! Hey! He's not the rightful owner of the car! Is it? Have the police planned to steal the car? Yes, Dorai! It's over. Everything's over now. -What do we do now? -What do you mean?! I sold the only car I had. I don't have a dime and I'm in debt! The jewels are stuck with the police now! You're asking me what to do? Where are you going? Dorai, I've made up my mind. We have to kill him. We won't get another chance. Don't worry about me. Take good care of my sister, that's all I ask. -Wait! Don't rush to a decision. -No! Let me go. I've made up my mind. -I'm going to end this today. Let me go! -Don't do it. It'll land us in trouble. Let me go! I said let me go! Hey! Idiot! Hello? Hey, move your vehicle! Hey, I told you to make way and you're looking at me. OUT OF MY WAY! Who the hell is this guy? Is he crazy? Can't you move your vehicle? I'm talking to you! Hey, how am I supposed to drive? Hey! I sold everything for that car but you and that manager are stealing it from me! Do I look like a fool to you? Hey, I'm the rightful owner of the car! The hell you are! We know you're not the owner. I'm the rightful owner of the car! -The car is mine! -What did you say? The car's yours? Hey! Hey! Police! Sir, he just hit me! What are you doing? -I'm talking. -What? I'm talking to him. -Sir! -Hey. He's trying to beat me up and steal the car! Didn't I warn you earlier? To lodge a complaint against him and that girl. You didn't want to. This is how they'll react. Fraudsters. -Hey, nab him. -Okay, sir. Come along. Can't you stay away from trouble? Stop staring and get lost! -You can leave. I'll take care of this. -Thank you, sir. Why are you complicating this further by trashing him on the road! Antony? Wasn't the name listed as Tamizh on the bill? Who is this guy then? Antony? My wallet… It's mine. That's my wallet, sir. I think it must've fallen off. I'll take it. Rascal! -Who are you? -I don't know anything. The guy in the car… -In the car? -Yes, sir! In the car. Who is in the car? Hey! Who's that in the car? -Constable! -Sir? -Go have a look. -Okay, sir. -So you're a fraud too? -Hey, who's in the car? Step out of the car. Shut up! [gasps] Sir! Look who it is! -Who is it? -It's… -Get them out! -Step out. -Sir… -Get down! Come out. Step out. Step out. So, you're a con artist too? Get out. If we teamed up with Dorai wouldn't we be in trouble? Who told you we're teaming up with him to get the car out? I have a different plan altogether. Do you know how to drive a car? Will you give me anything I ask for? Where are the jewels? It's fake but it's a replica. I've done as you asked. Duplicate. The policeman won't suspect him if you accompanied him. Okay, fine. Isn't he your manager at the jewel store? Hurry, let's get going! I've spoken to the inspector. You can go. What about the car then? Getting you off the hook was a huge deal. Now you want the car too? Get going! They're going to skin you alive for what you did. What will you do now? [sighs] Get lost. Come along. He let you go and latched on to that girl. Can't you be happy? I wanted ideas for getting back that car! Is that all? I GOT CAUGHT BY THE POLICE. Tell me your address. -Ma'am. -Sir? -Have you included her name in all five cases? -Yes, sir. -You're in for a surprise today! -Go ahead. Agalya! Agalya! Why have they brought over my daughter like a criminal? What will I do? Mom… Can you stop crying? Didn't I tell you earlier not to fret over the car? You don't worry, Thaen. Take Mom home. Nothing will happen to me. How can you expect us to leave you stranded? Mom… Sir… Sir… We don't want that wretched car, sir… We made a huge mistake! Let my daughter go and I'll take her home. Shut up! I will jail you along with them in the brothel case. -Has the case been filed? -All done, sir. -Bring them along. -Yes, sir. Come back tomorrow. Get in. Agalya! -Sir… -Move, ma'am. -Sir… Sir… -Get going. -Sir, sir… -Take your hand off, ma'am. Listen to me, sir… -Sir! Sir! -Move, lady! Agalya! Let my daughter go! Why are you staring? Sir… I- I wasn't staring, sir. There's no use of your stares though. Do you know how many girls I've dealt with during my service? But you kept slipping away! Sir… I want the car, sir. We had to resort to this for the sake of the car. Car is no big deal. She'll do anything for her sister. Sir… Please don't do this. Let me go, sir. What are you staring at? Do what I say. Listen, Mom. Let's think this car was a godsend for her marriage. Everything's ready. Have a good time! My darling! Sir… What? I have this tiny wish. Wish for something huge. Chastity is something crucial to every girl. And they'd wish to lose it to their husband after marriage. But… For me… It's happening like this. So? When I'm with my husband in the future, I don't think I can live with that guilt. And? Sir… Rape me instead. Rape you? Yes, sir. Please rape me. I'll try to forget it like a bad dream. A rape… Sir, sir… Leave me… Kamatchi sister? -They just left this place. -Alright, tell them what I say. -Wait, lady! -Hold on, you! Why are you shattering the glass now? Stop there. Please rape me, sir! Don't stand here and cry, ladies. I got a call saying your daughter is at Lakshmi Lodge. Look at how he ruined my daughter! Agalya… My dear! What did he do to my child… How can he take women's honor for granted? I am not going to spare that officer! I will… I will… Mom… Let go! I won't rest until I kill him. He isn't worth it. Throw away that stone. I said throw it. Check if he's coming. Unexpected, right? Did you think you could rape me and stride with pride? Did you think I'll allow it? I planned your ending already. Please rape me. You can never touch a girl hereafter. I'm just an ordinary girl who goes to work daily. Did you think what an ordinary girl like me could do to a man of power? After all, I'm a woman who deals with men like you who harass women on public transport. You are nothing in comparison. This video is ready to be sent to the press… …and tell every court about your attempt to rape. Within an hour… If my jewels and car keys aren't ready… I hope you know what the aftermath will be. Don't assume that honor and chastity apply only for women. I hope you realize it applies to you as well. Laters… -Give me. -Hold on, please. Yes, sir? Have you handed the keys? Not yet, sir. Do as they say. Thoroughly check the car. If you find something suspicious, lock the whole family in! If you don't find anything, hand them over the car keys. Okay, sir. The keys. Please hold. I have something important to do. I'll be back. I'll be back. Kumar! -Yes, sir. -Inspector has allotted us an important task. Come. They are heading towards the car! It's in the parking lot. Stop nagging and come. Get up, Mom. -Kumar! Get here. -What is it? Look at this hot gossip I got about sir! Wow, this is amazing. -Look at the mess he's got himself in! -Is it a rape? No idea. The press is after him. Why is it difficult to open the boot? Come here, sir! -What is it? -What are you digging while the inspector's jobless? -What are you saying? -Yes, get here to watch the news. They broadcast some random rumor… How did it open on its own? Should I check it? or don't? [gasps] I was asked to check it thoroughly… Shall I do it? Oh God! Alright. [clicks tongue] He lost his job anyway. -Show me the sensational news. -Have a look. He's finally caught after all this time. What the heck? All I see is spoilt food. Where is the corpse? You said there was a corpse. Where did it go? -Mom, what is she-- -Don't cook up stories! Whatever it may be. Good riddance of that crap. -Let's leave this place. -Yeah, let's go. There isn't any corpse here. Come, girls! [in Hindi] A plate of panipuri, brother. Why do we have to talk to him? Let's leave. Mom… Please forgive me. I've made a lot of mistakes. Did your brother-in-law ask you to pacify me like this? I'm your mother. I know you very well. Look, Dorai… I'll admit I did try to take the car on my own. Not because I fancied the car, but there was a problem. There is some guy along with them. -Nab them all. -Okay, sir. That problem is now solved. So take this car. Girls not only rely on their fathers but also their brothers. Hope you realize that. -Do you know what was in tha-- -Mom! Why would you harp on about the past? She's done good to you too. Let's go. Hang on a second. I didn't wish to marry her this way. They made me marry her by lying that she was pregnant. Pregnant? Even now they asked me to trick you and get the car from you. Trust me, please. I'll take care of Thaen's wedding. Dorai… HEY! Brother! We are having a family conversation here… Continue that in the van. Get in! -Hey! -Hey! Who are you? -Don't push me! -Hey! Let go! Dorai! You pulled one of your tricks again! Mom! Oh my! Dear God… He hired men to kidnap his own family! Hey! I'll end you if you lay hands on my sister! Dorai! -HEY! -Dorai! Mom! Hey! Sack this dog in a bag and keep him in the next room. -[all] Okay, sir. -Let me play with them for a while. Lift him up! -Hold his leg first. -Hold his leg, man! Your sister showed me a film. Now let me show you one! -Let go of her! -You come here. Leave her! Please let her go! Hey… Hey! HEY! Mom! Close the door! HEY! Die! Die! Damn it! -Go to hell! -Hey! HEY! HEY! -HEY! -Let go of her! Why is he turning this side? Oh no, he's trying to get up! Hold him, girls! Hold him down, girls! -Sir? -Hey! Hey! Sir? Sir! Did you call us? -What is it, man? -Hey! -Did you check the backside? -No one is there! Sir? Sir? Hey! What's that sound coming from inside? Sir? Are you there? -Sir? -Come. Let's break the door!

Sir, are you there? Sir? Sir? Sir? Do it! How can I? Do it! Sir! Open the door! [moans] [continues to moan] What happened? Hey… he's doing it in front of the other two! He didn't spare their mother too? -Hey! -Come let's go. Come! Let's have some tea. Of course! He won't be done any time soon. He's having the time of his life, man! -Hey… Agalya? -Yes. Do you have any other coupons? Where we can win a lorry or a bus in two days' time? I think I'll be in dire straits by the time your sister gets married! Dear God… This jinx? She'll never let us live in peace! What happened, Selvi? What's with the blood wounds all over your body? I committed a murder just now. What's up with you? You're such a jokester! I came here to tell you something important… Why don't you listen to me? Mom! For god sake, just listen to what this oldie has to say! Tell me what is it! You won't let me! That night… Your daughter and son-in-law got out of the car, right? Yes. That car was moving on its own! I got so scared! As I prayed to Mundakanni Goddess… I went near the car. Then… somebody got out of the car! I thought he'd be some kind of crook… and stole something from the car. I wanted to tell you this… But you guys couldn't care less about what I have to say! My darlin- Ow! -Agalya, take that log. -Why do you need a log? -Why? -Dear God! I came here to help you! -Throw that on her face! -Why are they hitting me? -Hey! Thrash her! -Hey! Leave me! Hey! Come here! Mom… -That is… -Aunt! You don't have to say anything. I spoke everything to my mother. The wedding will happen on the decided date. Whatever it is! I'll take care. Are you serious? Come. Come inside! -Welcome. -Thaen! Thaen will come. I got scared that you might demand a car or something again! Aunt! I have a car. Why don't we all go for a ride? The ride we just had is more than enough! This is the house. Right? -Yes. -Who are you looking for? Sir? I'm Dorai, sir. I bought some jewelry for you that day. Do you remember? Dorai. What happened to your head? That is… sir… Dorai… Give me the key. Sir… You are supposed to get this car. I don't understand. This car was a prize for the jewelry that you bought. The car should be with you. Oh God… He's taking a good look at it! Will he ask us to pay for the damages? "Who covets others’ honest wealth, That greed ruins his house forthwith." Do you know what it means? If one desires something that's not theirs… they will lose their lives, and their crime rate increases. Did you get it? We don't know what this couplet means, sir. But… We should live happily with what we have. We understood that very well. We'll get going. Let's go. Subtitles by QUBE
