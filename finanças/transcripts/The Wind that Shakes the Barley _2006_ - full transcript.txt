Come on! Come on! Come on, lads, throw it in! You should have got rid of the ball. You can't take it home with you. You can't take it home with you, right? It's a free-out. Oh, ref, that's a disgrace! He held it too long. Shut your mouth! Give me the ball, ref. The ball is there. - I want to see more of that! Come on, Shane. Come on, Shane. That's right. Come on, Teddy. Come on, Chris. Come on. Teddy O'Donovan... If you don't stop, I'll put you off. You're not playing hurling. Ah, go away. It's all right. It's all right. Come on, shake my hand. Shake my hand. - He is right. - Let the man fight for himself. We didn't come here to fight. - Ah, go away. - We came here to play. You're on your last warning. You go away. Come on, Teddy! Come on! Come on! Kick it in. Come on, Johnny! Come on! - Kick it in! Hey, Chris, you all right? You all right there? Grand. - Ah, that's good. We're going to miss you on the fullback line. - When you off to London, doc? - Ah, the weekend. What in the name of Jesus are you going over there for? Are there not enough sick people in Ireland, Damien? To lick the King's ass. With a tongue like yours, Tim, you'd be able to cure his piles and all. Want to sort your own out first, boy. I want to go up, see Peggy and your mam. She's up at the farm. We'll head up now? Grand. Hi, Mam. Damien Carey's heading away at the weekend. He wants to say good-bye. Welcome, Damien. Hello, Peggy. Your mother and father would have been very proud of you. They would indeed. They would indeed. They'll be watching over you, Damien. - Sinead. - Hopefully they will. Always knew you'd make it to the top. Well, I'm only starting, really. Don't be shy now. You're going to one of the very best hospitals in the world. It is, I suppose. - It is. - It is. Hello, Sinead. Damien. When you off? The weekend. I wish you all the best. Thanks. Thanks very much. - Mind yourself now. - I will. Right. God will protect you, son. I know he will. -Thanks, Peggy. All right. All right. All right... Get over there! Get over there! Against the wall! Against the wall now! Don't move a muscle! Don't look at me! Move! Right. How many times have you bastards, you Mick bastards, been told, eh? Defence of the Realm Act, do you understand? All public meetings are banned, and that includes your poxy little games. Do you understand? Check their details. I want names. I want addresses. I want occupation. - Name? - Con O'Sullivan. - Louder! - Con O'Sullivan! Balingeary. Ironmonger. - Name? - Chris Reilly. - Louder! - Chris Reilly. Don't look at me, boy. Reaves estate... by the crossroads. Farm laborer. More like a prick! Don't grin at me, you bastard. - Name. - Look down. - Your name! What's that shit? He doesn't want riddles. He wants your name, in English. Tell him... Shut the fuck up. Tell him. Bit of a comic, are we, boy? Can you see me laughing? Well, laugh at this. The lot of you, strip off, now! Shut up, you bitch! Move! - Officer, officer... - Shut the fuck up! Move! Move! I'm telling you his name. His name is Micheail O'Sullivan. He lives with me. Strip off right now. Right now! - Do it! Quicker! - Do it right now! Oh, don't, Micheail. Please take your clothes off. Take your bastard trousers off, you prick! Your bollocks are in a bag. They're not going to drop out. Come on! - Sarge, we got a tough guy over here! - Take your shirt off! Take your clothes off, Micheail. When I say strip, I mean fucking strip. Bastard! Get up, you little bastard! There is no one involved here, all right? Get up over there. He's only a 17-year-old. He's done nothing. Shut up! Shut it! Shut the fuck up! Micheail O'Sullivan is his name. He's not involved in anything. Shut up! - Against the wall. - Stay back! Stay inside the house, Peggy. Stay inside. He's not involved in anything! - Shut up! - 17 years of age, Micheail O'Sullivan. Shut up! Get back in your trough, you fucking sow! - Get back, you old bitch! - Micheail! He's 17 years of age, and isn't involved in anything. Yet you come here, beating women and children. Is this it? Is that your game, huh? Micheail! Let him out. That's him done, Sarge. Right, lads! Start backing off! Ah, big, brave men, aren't you? - Oh, sweet Jesus. Oh, Jesus Christ. God... Take him down. Take him... Micheail? Micheail? - Micheail? - Micheail? - Micheail? - Oh, Jesus. He's dead and gone. He's gone. Oh, no. Lads. - Right, Damien? - Hey, lads. - All right. Do you want a cigarette? Tell you, lads, it's the last straw. Benny McCabe, 10 days ago, you know? Innocent. What did he do? Cutting turf. And then there was Seamus. Shirt and tie. And Young Ernie across the way there. All young fellas from the parish. - And poor Micheail inside. - It's happening to everyone. You can't leave us now, Damien. Some of us have the brawn. Some have the brains. Not after this. We need you now more than we ever needed you. So what have you got to say for yourself? Think about it, Damien. We've got to get these bastards, lads, drive them out. I agree, we have to drive them out. How many British soldiers in the country, Tim? - Too many. - How many? - There's about 10,000, Damien. - 10,000. - Mm-hmm. - Tans? - Mm-hmm. - Artillery units? Machine gun corps? - Cavalry? - And many more besides. What's your point, Damien? It's young men like Micheail we're talking about, Teddy. Micheail was a real Irishman, Damien. You're a coward, Damien. I'm a coward? And you're a hero, is it, Ned? And you're going to take on the British Empire with your hurling, is that it? - It's better than walking. - Stun the bastards. For Christ's sake, Damien, what about Micheail? Look, Micheail was killed because he wouldn't say his name in English. Is that what you call a martyr, Teddy, is it? So we should all buy a one-way ticket to London. Is that it, Damien? Damien? Sinead. - Bye, Sinead. - We have to do something. Squad, halt! Right turn! Corporals, fall out! Listen up! I'm going to fall you out. The front rank will go to the far carriage. The rear rank will go to the nearest carriage. Squad! Squad, attention! Fall out! Hold it! Hold it! No soldiers on this train. - Stay there. - What? - No soldiers on this train. - Get out of the way. I am under instructions. - The driver of this train... - Move out of the way! - Driver! - Move out of the way. - Driver! Speak to him yourself. - Go out of the way! - Get out of the way! - There's the driver. Hold on, hold on. What's up? - Who the fuck are you, then? - Driver. Well, get back on the train and start driving it. Now, it's my duty to inform you that my union has instructed me not to carry any... I don't give a fuck about your union. Get back on the train and drive. ...British Army personnel, weapons, or supplies. Get back on the train or else I'll blow your fucking head off. You better tell him to get back on the train and drive. - Get back on the train! - I'm not moving the carriages. - Get back on the train! - I'm not moving the... Get back! - Can you drive the train? - Not without the driver. You, find someone to drive this train. - You better get him on the train. - Find someone! You hurt the driver! Find someone to drive the train, you fucker! I can't! Get back, lads. Irish fucking bastard! Bastard! I'll fucking kill you! Wouldn't drive the train, would you? Right, get them off the train. Everybody off the train! Come on, lads! Come on! Move it! All right, you all right? Yeah, I'm grand. See to him. - Look at me. You're all right. - Move it! You bastards! Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. - You're all right now. - Bastards. "I do solemnly swear that, to the best of my ability, "I will support and defend the government of the Irish Republic, "which is D?il Eirann, "against all enemies, foreign and domestic, "and I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, "and I take this obligation freely, "without any mental reservation "or purpose of evasion, so help me God." - Glad to have you with us. - Thank you, Finbar. - Steady Boy. - Well done, Damien boy. Thank you. Leo, thank you. - Good to have you, Damien. - Terence. - Good to have you, Damien. - Rory. - I knew you wouldn't get that train. - Did you now? Because I would have kicked your arse if you had. Where is the rest of that shagging section? Move, will you? I have him. I have him. I have him. Right sections, hollow square. Section two facing me, come on. Section one along here. Ned, Aidan, Sean, Damien, Paul, Vince, Richard, Dennis, Pat, down. Why are they down? Why are they down, lads? - Dead. - Dead, that's right. I estimate half the column just died. Everyone down. If we lose half this column, it's not readily replaceable. The Brits see you, they're going to kill you. The Brits catch you, they're going to kill you. Rory... Right, did you see our position when you came over the crest of that hill? You did not. You were looking down at your shoes, trying to pick your way through the mud and keep your shoes clean. There'll be clean shoes on your corpse. You also, 'cause it's your responsibility, led your men into open ground. You didn't use the natural cover there. It's on your shoulders, and I don't want to see it again. Listen, we're only saying this to you to keep you alive. I mean, all I need is the size of a packet of fags, only that size, huh? I've got fags on me. Chris, come here one second. A packet of fags, right? See that rock down there with four white spots on it? - Yeah. - Put that up on top of it. There's fags in that now. I want them back. - Right. - Go on. Look, listen, and learn. Over to the left now, Chris boy! Direct hit! You've wrecked your fag box! Good man. - Hi, lads. - Sinead. Bang on time. We're not long here ourselves. What have you got for us, Sinead? - Some fags for Steady Boy. - Thanks very much, Sinead. - Want one of them? - No, I'm all right. - It's from Finbar, Teddy. - Yeah? Jesus, boys, it's the barracks. - We're going to hit the barracks. - Which town is it? That's a detailed map of the building. I was almost caught on the way over to you. Christ, they stopped you? Yeah, a few miles back the road. - Were there many of them? - There was about eight or nine of them. - Did you get a fright? - I'm grand. - I'm going to head off. - Here, listen, we'll let you go. - Okay, mind yourself, won't you, girl? - Good luck, Sinead. Sinead. How are things at home? They're not the best. It's been tough on us all. I know. How are you yourself? Jesus, Damien. I can still hear his voice. I have something here for you. It's Micheail's Saint Christopher's medal, and I know that he really looked up to you, so I'd like you to have it. Thank you. I'll be thinking of you. Shit. Hey, you down there! What do you think you're doing? - All right, then. - Shut your mouth. Jesus! - Get down! - Get down, you ugly bastard! Hands above your heads! Get up! Get up out of bed! Up against the wall! Eyes straight ahead. The King doesn't want any heroes tonight. Now shut up! Right, men. Back here, please. Understand this. You are now seen as traitors to your nation. If I hear one more report of any of our boys falling down your stairs, you'll be shot. Is that clear? This is your final warning. Right, men, load them up. Come on, lads, let's move it on. Come on, now. Hurry up. Keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you. It's not as easy as it looks. Nice shot, Teddy, lad. Nice shot. 22... 22-16. Listen in. Five minutes, lads, and you're off the table. Right, lads, get on this side of the table now, move! Come on, move your arse! Get in line now! Eyes down, arms up! - You heard heard him, arms up. - Come on! You're all thoroughly a sack of shit, the lot of you! You cretinous crap. You piece of shit. Look at you! Arms up. Don't eyeball me. Keep them up. We done here, lads? A pound a day, lads. A pound a day. That's what they're paying them bastards. - Is that right? - Yeah. Our pounds out of our pockets to pay for that swagger. ...by a personal friend of that bollocks Churchill. So we can expect what the Boers got, can we? Oh, the very same, yeah. Friend of the worker. Faster, faster. Come on, Teddy. Dear God. You're sitting in oil, Pete, and that's for sure. Get their guns! Move! Move. Come on, Damien, go! Go, go, go! Take the end house! Go, go, go! You fucking bastards. - Don't you fucking move. There's no one here! There's no men! - Where's the men? - There's no one here. - Stay still. - Spread your legs. - Get your hands above your head! - Against the wall! Leave him alone! - Get over there. - Leave him alone! Move down! Get down! Stay there! If you don't stop fucking around, we'll take you out! - Hello, Bill. - Good morning, John. May I introduce Captain Harris? - Captain Harris. - Sir. Do come through, will you? Hello, Bill. It's good to see you. Lovely to see you, Catherine. - Good morning, Julia. - Good morning, sir. Is Chris milking the cows? He is. Chris! - Chris. - Yeah. Sir John wants to see you. Sir John wants to see you. The soldiers are with him. Should I take a run for it? No, you can't. They've got the place surrounded. Come along. They're in there. - Must I go in? - Go on, knock. Come in. Oh, Reilly. Come in, come in. Come in. I'll get the carpet dirty. Mud on my boots, sir. That's the least of your worries, Reilly. Come over here. Now, tell these two gentlemen where you were last Friday, the day of the ambush. I was at my uncle's funeral. Which uncle? He lives far away. Where, Reilly? Clare. You don't have an uncle in Clare, Reilly. - I do, sir. - Don't lie to me. We paid a little visit to your mother in her lovely little cottage. She mentioned nothing about a funeral. You don't have to go to my mother. Stop lying, Reilly, and stop wasting our time, or I'll see to it personally that your mother and your family suffer! My family's nothing got to do with it, sir. We know you know Teddy O'Donovan. Yes, you do. Oh, yeah. Um, didn't see him in a while, actually. Well, we will find him, with or without you. Oi, get down, shut up. Give me your rifle. Get the rifle. Put the rifle down. Give me the fucking rifle, or I'll blow your brains out. Get down. Right, where the fuck are they? I'll blow your fucking brains out. Tell me where they are. Wake up, you Irish bastards! Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in! Fucking Irish scum. - Kevin? - Kevin. We're fucked, Teddy! Kevin, you're grand. Look... Let me look. Let me look. Hold it up. He's all right. - Yeah? Take this... - Hold it like this. It's just a nick, Kevin. It'll stop the bleeding, all right? - Look at me. - Yeah. Just keep the head back. Hold that there. - Did they pick you up together? - Yeah. Do I know you, do I? You're the train driver. Do you remember, on the platform? You wouldn't let the Tans on the train. - You're the doctor? - That's right. That's right. What do they have you in for? The written word. "Disloyally affected person," whatever that means. Right, which one of you fuckers is Teddy O'Donovan? - It's me. I'm O'Donovan. - Right, get him out! - I'm O'Donovan. - Get outside, you Fenian fucker! Get out! Sit down! I'm Teddy O'Donovan. State your name again! Teddy O'Donovan... Get this one out. You Fenian fucker. Get him out of here! Get him out! Lead on, you, Teddy! Move! Lead on, you, Teddy! - Get in there! - Fucking get in that chair. You fucking dirty Irish fucker! Hello, Teddy. It's a pleasure to meet you in the flesh after all this time. Where's your safe houses, Teddy? I want names, places, Teddy. Where's your weapon stashes? I'm going to make you squeal, Teddy, like all the other fuckers. So you'd better start talking to me. Now, I take it... that you want me to carry on with this, yeah? Now I want names and fucking places! And you better start telling me soon! Names and places. Come on, sunshine. Come on, you can do it. Come on. Come here, you little... Come on, Teddy. Come on, Teddy. - Come on! Tell me! Teddy! Hold it together, Teddy! Hold it together! Teddy! Teddy! - I can't take that fucking shit. Come on. We have to be strong for him. Do you hear me? - He'd want you to be strong, boy. Sing the song. Shut up! Shut up! Fucking Irish. Get in there. Fucking get in there. Jesus Christ, you fucking bastards! What have you done to him? Keep his hands up, lads. Give me something for his head. Give me something for his head. Help me with his head. You're all right, Teddy boy. Keep them up, now. - I never said a word. - I know you didn't, Teddy. - I never said... - I know you didn't, boy. I know you didn't. You're the most stubborn man I ever met, huh? You're all right. How long have you known him? All my life. He's my brother. Open that fucking door. Yeah, yeah, yeah! Get up, you Fenian fucker! Get them outside! Get them up behind your head! Move! Get in there! What's your name? I am... I am a member of the Irish Republican Army, and I demand to be treated as a political prisoner. No, you're not. You're a murdering gangster who shoots young men in the back. No, you're wrong. I'm a Democrat. In the last election, Sinn F?in won 73 seats out of a possible 105. Our mandate's for an Irish republic completely separate from Great Britain. A democratic decision. Listen, that is not my responsibility. I'm just a soldier sent by my government. Your government, which suppresses our parliament, which bans our paper. Your presence here is a crime, a foreign occupation. You tell me what I'm supposed to do as a Democrat. Turn the other cheek for another 700 years, is that it? That is not my responsibility. - Get out of my country. - What is your name? Get out of my country. You're not a bog cutter. Show me your hands. Show me your fucking hands. What are you going to do? Pull my fingernails off, is that it? What do you fucking well expect? These men fought at the Somme! Up to their necks in vomit, in filthy trenches, while their friends got blown apart in front of their eyes! Sort him out! - Give me your name! Your name. Come here. Soldier... Shoot him in the temple. In the temple! I can't do it! - Do it! - I can't! Do it! It's an order! Tomorrow. Military court. An execution for possession of a firearm. "So I turned... "to the garden of love. "And priests in black gowns "were walking their rounds... and..." "Binding with briars, my joys and desires." William Blake. I got deported to Wales. Frongoch Camp. Don't tell these bastards, but they were the best years of me life. I learned to read and write... and think. Were you in the citizen army? Mmm. - With Connolly? - Oh, yeah. Did you ever hear him speak? Dublin Lockout. 1913. Saturday afternoon in the pissings of rain. He set the place alight. "If you remove the British Army tomorrow... "and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, "unless you organize a socialist republic, "all your efforts will have been in vain. "And England will still rule you "through her landlords, capitalists, and commercial institutions." Thank you, Mr. Connolly. I used that once in a debate at university. Jesus, I was all talk, boy. And when it came down to it, I always had an excuse, you know? Teddy could see right through that. The man of action. We were fierce close as young fellas, you know. Just the two of us. Me following him around all the time. I could never match him. They sent him away and... 12 years of age. The seminary at 12 years of age. Sure, by the time he came back, he was a man. - And I was still a boy. My name's Johnny Gogan. My dad's from Donegal, and I won't have your death on my conscience. Come on. - Where's the other fellas? - Away for a piss. - I haven't got the key. - What? I don't have the key for this cell. Open the door. Do it. Come on, come on. Damien, come back! Damien, come back! Bye, lads. You must be hungry now. I'm starving. Thanks very much. How is he? Aye, he'll be fine. Bearing up. Eat up now. You'll need to stay strong. What age are you? - Nineteen. - Nineteen? What made you do it? I don't know. Well, you're a brave lad. Isn't he, Mam? He's a very brave lad. And we're very proud of you. - My dad's from Donegal. - Where? - Donegal. - Oh, you're partly Irish. - There's a fresh bit there if you want it. - Thanks. How are you holding up? Sure, not great. You did well, Damien. Kevin, Johnny, and Colum are still there, you know? They can be shot at any time. We left them there. Ah, Jesus Christ. I can't take much more of this. We know who turned you in. Mairi's a typist at the barracks, and she found a letter and made a copy of it. The horse you wanted is in the stable over there. That's for you, Teddy. You've got to rest after this. - Tim'll take you back. - Yeah. - Damien's next in command. - Sean? Go. Go, Julia. - Go on, get in there! - Don't move, don't move! Put your hands behind your head! Put your hands behind your head! Give him the letter. Read it. "I feel duty-bound to inform you of my suspicions "concerning a member of my staff. "Recently, I have observed... "some unsavory characters "trespassing on my lands. "Most of them are a trumped-up bunch of rustics, "shop hands, and corner boys "with delusions of grandeur. "I am now certain "my own employee, Chris Reilly, "takes orders from trench coat thug "Teddy O'Donovan, who I know is a top priority for you." I don't suppose you know what he looks like? Short and thick, I imagine. Get him some paper. Write this down in your own words. Go on. For the attention of General Hugh Tudor. I am responsible for the arrest of 11 members of the I.R.A. Three now face execution. If one hair on their head is touched, I will get a bullet, too. Such a beautiful room. It's hard to imagine a man's scream from here. Ever seen fingernails ripped out with a rusty pliers, Sir John? Hmm? All your learning, and you still don't understand. Oh, I understand perfectly, Mr. O'Donovan. God preserve Ireland if ever your kind take control. Well, you better start getting used to the idea. A priest-infested backwater! Finish the letter. Make sure he signs it. And then help him find his best pair of walking shoes. A little exercise will do a gentleman farmer no harm at all. Chris. All right, Ted. Come on. What? Get your coat. That's the house of Danny and Peg. Go to there. They'll have dinner on the boil for us. - Welcome, welcome. - Thank you. Welcome, boy. - You must be very tired. - Must be very tired. - Peggy'll have some... - It's an awful long walk. ...dinner prepared for you in there, boys. - Thanks very much. - You're welcome. - Thanks very much. - I'm sure you must be very tired. I'm starved. Dan? I've a message for Damien O'Donovan. It's me. Will there be any message? No, go on. They've executed Johnny, Colum, and Kevin. Oh, Jesus Christ, almighty. Bastards. Were they tortured? They were. Jesus. I've received orders to execute the spies. Not Chris as well? Ah, Jesus Christ, lads. He's only a young fella, like. Hamilton's a civilian. You could order him to leave the country. He cost us three lives already. It could have been more. It was his own choice. Ah, but Chris, we can't do that. - He's one of our own. - Congo, he's a traitor. I'm sorry, lads, but this is war. What are we doing here, like? It's a war. Come on, move him on, will you? Over here. Straight ahead. I studied anatomy for five years, Dan. And now I'm going to shoot this man in the head. I've known Chris Reilly since he was a child. I hope this Ireland we're fighting for is worth it. Where's your letters? Come on. That's for... For my wife, for my children. I'll make sure they're delivered. Turn around! You'll never beat us. Ever! Right. Get up there. Right, there. Give me your letters, Chris. Give me your letters, Chris! I didn't know what to write, and Mam can't read. Just tell her I love her, and where I'm buried. Come here. - You want me to do it? - No. Are you sure? Pr... Promise me, Damien. Promise me you won't bury me next to him? The chapel. Do you remember, on the way up? - Do you remember? - Yeah. In there. Tell Teddy I'm sorry. I'm scared, Damien. Have you said your prayers? Yeah. I'll protect you. Sean, how are you? - Not too bad. - Damien. And two more have been burnt down. The peelers aren't fighting back at all. - Two barracks is what I'm told. - That's brilliant, lads. Not just the barracks, lads. Courthouses, tax offices. That's excellent. Listen, lads, there's some fantastic things happening up and down the country for the Republican cause. The dockers went on strike yesterday. The railway men are still refusing to transport arms or anything around the country. It has the bloody army in chaos. Yeah, it's excellent. It's still holding. Every county council and city council in the country has pledged allegiance to the D?il. Apart from a few. They're hitting back, though, lads. We lost two fellas down by O'Connor's last week, you know? Not to mention the dozens arrested, so... And tell us, how are the hunger strikers? They're holding up, Damien. They're doing their best, you know? Court's on inside. You going in? Go in and listen to Lily doing her stuff. Come on, go in now. Go on. Good. They're scabbing well. - You're looking after them? - I am, yeah. - Good man. - I'm sorry about Chris. Must have been tough. How have you been? Been grand, boy, grand. Thanks. Come on. Right, and did you agree the terms on the loan, and did you make it clear to Mr. Sweeney that you wouldn't be able to repay him for quite some time? See, she knows exactly what she's talking about. - Mr. Sweeney. - She agreed the terms, and she said she'd start the repayments straight away. You'll be given time to give your opinions, Mr. Sweeney. She agreed to start paying and made no effort. - Mrs. Rafferty. - Quiet yourself. Mrs. Rafferty, you agreed on this loan, but did you let Mr. Sweeney know that you wouldn't be able to repay immediately? Look, what's she say? - You do know exactly what it was. - Mr. Sweeney... She said she'd be able to start paying straight away... Mrs. Rafferty is being questioned at the moment. ...at the rate agreed. - You will be given time. All right, I'm only just filling in when she's saying she doesn't understand what I'm saying. Sinead, do you have those figures for me? The accumulative interest, Mr. Sweeney, is over 500 percent. Five hundred percent? Interest is bound to accumulate if you're not making repayments. That's normal commercial practice. Under the authority... Oh, come off it now, Sweeney. Five hundred! - That is normal. - Come off it, boy. It's standard normal practice. - What am I supposed to do? - Excuse me. Offer charity if she falls on hard times? This is a recognized court under the authority of D?il Eirann, and a bit of decorum, please, is required. Mr. Sweeney, quite frankly, my sympathies lie with Mrs. Rafferty in this matter. Oh, that's very clear, Mrs. Kearney. Those are extortionate interest rates to be charging. And it's abuse of your position in the community to be charging that. This is a Republican court, not an English court. I hereby order you to repay Mrs. Rafferty 10 shillings and sixpence. You have seven days in which to do so. That is this day next week. Thank you. Me repay her? Are you joking me? There's no way I'm paying any money to Mrs. Rafferty. She's the one who owes me money. - That is the court's decision. - I'm the aggrieved party here. You're asking me now to forget, to waive my interest. The court's decision is final, and you will respect its authority. I'm the one owed money, and you call that justice? - Sit down! - You get the result that you want. - That's enough. - A kangaroo court is what it is. Be fair. Go away. Let me go! What do you think you're doing? Get your hands off me! - Take it easy, Mr. Sweeney. - Get your hands off me! Let go of me! - Bring him back. - What? Bring him back here. Teddy O'Donovan's after taking Mr. Sweeney off us. He's taken him out the front door of the court. Teddy O'Donovan! Teddy O'Donovan, come back into this courthouse immediately. - Teddy O'Donovan... - What? ...I'm not standing here all day for you! Teddy O'Donovan, come back here, please! Who the hell do you think you are to interfere with a court decision? Lily, calm down for a second. Answer the question. By whose authority? You answer my question. Do you want every merchant and businessman in the county up against us, with decisions like that? You're interfering with the court decisions by your actions, Teddy. Are you going to throw me in jail, too? Who will fight the war then, you? What Mr. Sweeney did to Mrs. Rafferty was wrong, Teddy. - And you can't cosset him... - It was wrong, but I need the man's money to buy weapons. What am I to do without weapons? We can't fight a war like that. How are we supposed to maintain the trust of the people with you undermining the court like that? We'll maintain the trust of the people with weapons in our hands because we have men on the four corners of this town defending this town at this very moment in time. We took it from the British with force. And the first judgment of this, an independent court, you have undermined by deciding to settle it in a pub. He provides us with money to buy weapons. - There's a consignment coming in... - I'm sure we can afford... There is a consignment coming in from Glasgow in the next few weeks. You tell me how I'm going to pay for that if he's down in the cells sulking. We should enforce the court's decision. - I'm volunteering. Anyone else? Hey, hold on a minute. Now, hold on. There's a war on, right? We have one objective: to get the British out of Ireland. And the Sweeneys of this world give us rifles. More important than a box of fucking groceries. A little clarity now, in the name of God. Well said, Rory boy. Well said. So we'll paint the town Republican green, but underneath we're still the same as the English. Is that what you're saying? No, we're not the same as the English. We are if we do that. Better than painting it fucking red, anyway. - Ah, shut up. - Easy. Take it easy. - Francis, come on. - Justice and equality for all! - Take a copy of the proclamation! - Take it easy, man. He's grand. He's grand. Are you boys finding this funny? - Very funny. - Very, very funny. Turn out your pockets, lads. Come on. How much money have you got in your pocket? Be careful there now, Dan, you wouldn't... Hang on. Be quiet, there. Be quiet. - How much money have you got? - What are you talking about? Come on, can you not answer a civil question? - How much money have you got? - Answer him, Tim. How much? I have a shilling, all right? All right, Ned, how much land do you own? Answer me, come on. - Have you a blade of grass to your name? - No, not a blade, no. Look, Dan, these boys are fine. They work for my father. Let me finish. I'm talking here. Right, you're paupers, just like me. Now, you want to take a look up and down this country and see the amount of volunteers that are involved in land seizures and cattle drives. Do you want to know why that's happening, do you? - Look, that's enough of that talk. - It's not enough of it! The I.R.A. are backing the landlords and crushing people like you and me. You sat down and had dinner with the I.R.A. last night... I'm talking here. Do you want madness up and down the country? Hold on a minute. You saw it here two minutes ago. These boys backing the local bigwig and selling out a mother who hasn't got a penny in her pocket, just like yours! Now, Teddy, I have no problem... no problem taking any order you want to give me. I will... I'll jump off a cliff, if you want. But you... you sure as hell better respect this court. - Dan... - This is our government. Dan, I understand what you're saying, and I feel sorry for Mrs. Rafferty. Our government has given responsibility to Lily and her people... I will pay for the woman's groceries out of my own pocket. It's not about that! We buried him in this chapel in the mountains. And I went down and l... And I told his mother. His mother, who has cooked meals for me and her son. And I told her. She... She just looked at me. And then she went in, and she put on her shoes. And she come out and she said, "Take me to my child." And we walked for six hours, and she didn't say one word. Then we got to the chapel. And I showed her the grave, and I'd put a... cross and some flowers on it. And she turned to me and she said, "I never want to see your face again." I've crossed the line now, Sinead. I want time with you, Damien O'Donovan. I can't feel anything. In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sanctus. - Thanks, Father. - Right. That's all, Father. Thanks. Right. I'll give the boys a blessing, Finbar. May our Lord Jesus Christ, who sacrificed himself on the cross for each and every one of you, may he grant you the strength and courage... to deal with the trials and tribulations that lie before you. In Nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Congo... in there. Ned... just on Damien's right. Finbar, on the far side... - Just by... - There? Yeah, on Ned's right. Auxies, lads! Auxies! Auxies! Come on! - Cease fire! - Cease fire! Damien. Congo... Cease fire! Go down and check. Congo, cover Damien. Dan, Finbar, Vince. Shane, watch the position from here. Donacha, eyes toward the open road there. You okay, Teddy? One man dead! One man dead! We've got one man dead! - What did he say? - One man dead. One man dead. Who's dead? Finbar, one man dead! One man dead! - Up here, Damien. - Get the weapons. Weapons and documents. It's Gogan. Give me your gun. He's dead. He's gone? - What? - He's gone. He's dead. Gogan's dead. Get up. Come on. Men, you've trained for this. - Come on, men, look lively! - Move it, boys. Come on, you. Wake up, you. - Come on, men. You're soldiers. - Stop looking at them. - You are soldiers. - Move, move, move. Move it, come on! Move it! - Come on, move it! - He would have killed you! - Move, move. Come on, fall in. - Come on, move. Form up your columns! Into threes. - In threes there. - Threes! - Shoulder your weapon. - Come on, boy. Sean, buck up, boy! Into your sections. Into your sections. Column! - Atten-tion! - Hup! Rough business, boys. Filthy job. Now, look again. I'm going to show you something. Look... Look to your right. Look to your right. Mercenaries who were paid to come over to make us crawl and to wipe us out. Here's what we've done. We've sent a message to the British Cabinet that will echo and reverberate around the world. If they bring their savagery over here, we will meet it with a savagery of our own. Come on, fellas! Get in there! Everybody out! Get 'em out! Come on. Keep going, Sean. Come on! Come on! Get 'em out! Against that wall! Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees! On your knees! Shit. Have you a round? Have you got one round? We haven't a bullet between us. Stay where you are. Oh, shit. Oh, fucking hell. Look, let me just go down there. Stay the fuck down. There's nothing we can do. There's nothing we can do. Just forget it. Sit her down here! Get her here! - No! - Get her arm. Get her arm! - Right, sir! - Oh, Jesus Christ. - You bastards! - No! Get off me! You bastards! No, no, you stay where... You stay where you are! You don't know who... You stay. You stay where you are. Whoo! Get him off! Aaahh! Tell us what we want! Tell us what we want to know! I don't know! Tell us where you... Cut off her hair! Stay. Fenian whore! Watch it burn. - Come on, watch it! Look at it burn! Oh, no! Tell us what we want! Tell us! Tell us! Look at it! No! Get over there against the wall! - Get down! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go on over to your mam. Easy does it. How's she holding up, Damien? She's very weak still. Well, Bernadette... we'll just have to start thinking about finding you somewhere to stay for the next few weeks. I'm sure McCarthys will keep us for a while, Damien. I'll go over there later on. Well, of course. Mam, we'll go over to McCarthys' later on. They'll keep us for a while. - I'm not moving out of this place. - What? I'm not moving out of this place. But sure, Nan, where are you going to stay? I was four years old. My father died with famine fever. And later, I had five children, and I was evicted, and they'll not move me out, unless in a box. Yeah, but it will only be for a few weeks, you know? Nan, there's nothing here. The house is gone. I'll... I'll clean out the chicken coop. Ah, now, don't be talking like that. You'll clean out the chicken coop, Nan? Yes, I'm going... I'm cleaning the chicken coop. The chicken coop where Micheail was murdered. Do you expect us to live inside the chicken coop? I'm going to clean the chicken coop. You can't do this to me, Nan! I'm going to clean the chicken coop. Jesus Christ, can you not see what they've done to me? Come on, easy now. I'm not as strong as you, Nan. - I'm going. - Mam, please. Jesus, Damien, - will you take me away from here? - Shh. Shh. Come here to me. I can't take it anymore. Sinead, Sinead, come on. Come on. I don't want to end up like her. I want to have some kind of a life, Damien! Come on, Sinead. Come on, come on. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Come on, now. You're still in shock. Do you hear me? It's all gone. Easy now, easy now, easy now, easy now. Sinead. Easy. Teddy O'Donovan? Teddy O'Donovan? I have an urgent message for Teddy O'Donovan. Yeah? What do you want? I've a message. Um... Good man. What's your name? Tom... Thomas, sir. What's the message? I don't know. It just has a "T." - That's all I know. - "T"? The most important word of the message starts with a "T"? - Cup of tea, then? - Where's the message? Who gave it to you? Um... a man down in the village. A little chap with a message. I think he's lost it, though. Come on, old boy, where's the message? Um, it must be in here. Check in your back pockets. Who gave it to you? Have you lost it? What did he say to you? Was it a piece of paper or something? Yes, a piece of paper. Was it an important message? Yes, he said it was very important, and it was for Teddy O'Donovan. He had a message. He's lost it. Come on. We don't have time for this now. Did you come down the hill or up the hill? Down the hill. Go see if you can find where he dropped it. Was it thick? Thick for dropping the message, was it? Is he a local man? Hold up. I have it, I have it, I have it. "A truce has been declared. "Hostilities cease from midnight. God bless you all. Finbar." - Truce. - Say it? A truce has been declared. "A truce has been declared. "Hostilities cease from midnight. God bless you all..." Give me that. You're joking. - Jesus Christ. - Is that right? It's a truce, lads. Is that right? Yeah. Very urgent. "A truce has been declared." 'Tis Finbar's writing, right? "God bless you all. Finbar." That's it? Yes, yes! Yes! They ought to know. Mmm... It says, "British and Irish leaders sign Peace Treaty." "The agreement will establish a new Irish Free State." "It will have full control of customs, tariffs, and economic policy." That's it, boy. "The Irish delegates signed the... Teaty." No, "Treaty." Excuse me. "The new state will remain within the British Empire as a dominion." "Members of the new Parliament will swear an oath of allegiance to the British Crown"? You see this? "'Splendid news,' says the King"? What kind of peace can be had with the King? No way, boys. They're in the wrong. I don't have any fucking King. Fuck off. The Irish state. - What? No way. - Oh, for Christ's sake. - No way! - Goodness, no! Is this what we fought for, is it? Is this what we fought for, is it? A betrayal of 1916. Look at this, boy. It's all true. "lmmediate and terrible war." Those were the exact words. The threat promised by the British Cabinet if we didn't ratify this treaty. Lloyd George, Churchill, Chamberlain, Birkenhead, Hamar Greenwood... a bunch of more vicious bastards in the one room you can't imagine. They have just watched 17 million men, women, and children die in the Great War. So what makes any of you think they're going to give a damn about a few thousand dead Republicans? Bluffing. They're in a dirty war, and they can't win. Oh, I see. Fair enough. I agree. They're not gonna lose face in America and the rest of the world. They're not gonna risk that, Teddy. It's costing them 10,000 pounds a day. They can't afford that. Oh, they've a lot more after that, boy, don't you worry. Lads, now, you're... you're not hearing what Teddy's saying. "lmmediate and terrible war." Think about it. We've 31/2 dozen rifles in the country. How's that gonna work for us, huh? Lads, we have freedom within our grasp. We're that close. It's just one inch, but it's still out of reach. And if we stop now, we will never again regain the power that I can feel in this room. I can sense it in this room today. And if we stop short now, never in our lifetime will we see that energy again, ever! So I'm begging each and every one of you to just go that inch. We cannot stop until we've complete freedom from Britain! Remember this? Remember this? Each one of us swore an oath of allegiance to the Irish Parliament of 1919. And this treaty flies in the face of it. It insults it by asking us to swear another oath to the King that we're trying to get out. An oath. And maybe if I was a politician like yourselves, I mean, yeah, I could say whatever I want. But I'm not. I'm a Republican. And the only question I want you to answer today is, are ye men of your word? Do you... Do you expect me to answer that? Are you a Republican? Of course I'm a Republican! I need to say something in answer to that. That bloody liar. Absent faces. But they're still present in here. There's Kevin, Johnny, Colum, murdered in the barracks. There's Benny, shot in the back while cutting turf. Aidan, tortured and then hung. Micheail... Jesus, I could go on all day, but we can't forget Micheail. He was beaten to a pulp in front of his mother. And I... cannot... I will not... spit on the graves of our dead martyrs by swearing an oath of allegiance to the British Crown! Hear, hear! If you really want to desecrate the graves of those boys, if you really want to insult their memories, you go ahead and reject this treaty, because this is what they died for. And because a lot of you are too stubborn... you're too stubborn to... - Collins sold us out with that treaty. - You're too stubborn to... You watch how you talk about Michael Collins. Michael Collins is a hero. He went down there to London. He was seduced by the wining and the dining. He did not negotiate a proper treaty. - Bloody surrender. - How is it more of a surrender than what the British are doing? Think of the concessions they've made. Lloyd George is in a coalition with die-hard Tories. As far as they're concerned, Ireland is this tiny dot in a much bigger picture. Do you seriously think he'd... they'd let him give the green light to nationalists in India and in Africa and the whole fuckin' empire by giving us complete independence? It was never going to happen that way, and you all know it. If we ratify this treaty, we will destroy the two most precious gifts that we won with this last election... one being a mandate for complete freedom, not a compromised freedom; the second being a democratic program which... in which is enshrined the priority, the public welfare over private welfare. Now, this treaty will copper-fasten the hold of the powerful over the poor, because there will be a governor general who will have our puppet Parliament on a leash. And it will be business as usual, with workers tied to a shift at a factory bench and fellas out begging for jobs. It's partition. The partition of the country. The alienation, the abandonment of our brothers up in the top of this country. The... You say the Brits are leaving here? They're going 300 miles up the road, Leo. That's where they're going to. But men, women, and children are being burned out of their homes, Teddy. It's true, boy, it's true. It is true. My cousins are on the streets of Belfast, burned from their homes by loyalist mobs. There's refugees all over Dublin. You know what this treaty means for them? Instead of sectarian gangs, they'll now face those same thugs, armed and uniformed by the British state. Read the treaty, Sinead. Read the treaty. There is no certainty there, Teddy. And then we'll have a divided Ireland. There is certainty. Read the treaty. - There is no certainty. - Read the treaty. There is certainty. There is no certainty. Wait a minute. Dan? My dad was a navvy. He worked in London... digging holes for tuppence ha'penny until it killed him. I got two sisters I never got to know because they died in infancy for want... want of a doctor. Now, what I signed up to, when I got involved in this... was part... Here. I have a piece of paper here. It's from the... the Democratic Programme of the First D?il. It's a short quote, Finbar. I won't keep you. I'm gonna read this out to you. "The nation's sovereignty "extends not only to all the men and women of the nation, "but to all its material possessions... "the nation's soil, and all its resources, all the wealth, and all the wealth-producing processes within the nation." That means all of us here, and all of us in this country, own every bit of this country. And that's what we all signed up to when we voted for the D?il. - Hear, hear. - Right? Yeah. If we pursue this... every child in this country will have an equal chance. If we don't, they won't have a chan... a chance in hell. If we ratify this treaty, all we're changing is the accents of the powerful and the color of the flag. Well done! - Well said. - That's nonsense! That's nonsense! Well, thanks be to God, but 'tis a great day to see the back of them. Jesus Christ, I thought I'd never see the day. It certainly is. Not before its time. Exactly. Good riddance to them. One-way ticket now, lads. Have a safe journey, and God bless to all of you. Bugger off, Paddy! And I'll see you in hell. Eyes to your front, soldier! Look at them, lads, not a gun between them. Handed them all over to the Free-Staters. Jesus Christ, Dan, they're on their way. Is that not good enough for you? Here, look at the Gombeen men. Licking their lips already, Damien. Decent men, Dan. - Oh, are they? - Yeah, they are. It's Teddy in the Free State uniform. What? Teddy. He's wearing the bloody Free State uniform. Kick out the black and tans, bring in the green and tans. You bastards, the lot of you. Won't even give us a chance. This treaty's been approved by the D?il. Hasn't been approved in the field, Donacha. Save it! Hasn't been approved in here, boy. Any of you for a drink? Yeah, go on. How are you, boy? Lads. We're back at work again. I have to go to Dublin. The Republican Army leaders have summoned an emergency meeting. Seven out of ten volunteers out against the treaty. These Free State ladeens up here are recruiting left, right, and center. Ex-British Army, all sorts. Is it true they're bringing in weapons from England? There's all sorts of rumors flying all over the place. We're setting up a new H.Q. in Dublin. I need the pair of you, and I need Rory to keep the training going. I'll be in touch when I can. All right. What if they try and take the guns off us? Over my dead body will we give up a single bullet. Right, keep your backsides down. Tuck it into your elbows. Keep your ass down. Get the muzzle up out of there. Go on. You'll smash that rifle. The butt of your rifle is facing away from you. Come on, boy, keep the line, will you? Come on. Keep the line, lads. Come on, don't be rushing ahead. Christ's sake, my grandmother could do better than this. You're falling behind again, you dozy bollocks! Now, move forward! Down the line. Look down the line. There isn't one! Your muzzle's going straight into the dirt, Gerry. Right, next line! Don't be last in line! "On the double" means run. Come on! Form the line. Oi, on your bellies. Put the rifles as we told you. You know where you're going. You don't have to look. Your dozy face makes a great target! Now, put your head down! Are you the doctor? Are you the doctor? - I need a doctor. - I'm a doctor. I've a very sick child at home. Can you come see him? In to your left. Thank you. Well, now. Hello. What's your name? Diarmuid. Can I have a little look at your eyes? There's a good man. Good boy. Will you stick out your tongue for me? Now say "Ahh." Ahh. Good fellow. Right. Will you sit up? I want to have a look at your tummy. Take that off. Good man. Now, lie back down for me. Will he be all right, Doctor? He will. He'll be fine. Good boy. Good man. Would you like a glass of water? I won't, no, I'm fine. Maybe a drop for himself. Right. Up you get, now. - Are they your sisters outside? - Yes. What are their names? Aoife, Sheila, and Emer. Aoife, Sheila, and Emer. How is he? He's half-starved, Dan. Jesus. There's two piles of 30 there, all right. Double-check them. All right. Who's doing the stall on Saturday? - Huh? - The stall. - I'm not doing any stall. - What? Fuck off. Ask Lily to do the stall. I can't do the stall on Saturday. You'll have to do it. - I can't do the stall. - I can't. One thing I don't understand about you lads. Why do you always put Labour above the Republic? Telegram from Dublin. Finbar was in the Four Courts with all the Republican leaders. Free-Staters smashed the place with 18-pounders from the British. What? Fuck's sake. Bastards! Sinead, was there anyone killed? I've no details, Lily. But Finbar wants us to hit back down here immediately. I'm not hitting back. Where are you off to? - I'm sorry, lads. - Fuck. Formal order. That's an order from Finbar. Ah, you can tell that to the bastards, killing Republicans in the Four Courts! Rory. Rory, where are you going, boy? The longer I stay here, the more men... the more of my l... men's lives are in danger. Come on. What's this gonna achieve? Ned! We've received our orders, all right? Jesus Christ. Sorry, lads. I'm not hitting back. There's men in the Four Courts. Our comrades are up there, Steady Boy. - Damien, they're getting hit. - It's important. I'm with you all the way, but... Do you understand what's happening here? These are our own lads. I'm sorry. No, no, our comrades are in the Four Courts. They're our comrades. - This is not gonna stop in the Four Courts. - It's over for me. Steady Boy, hold on. Just hang on, will you? Jesus Christ. Right, you bastards! Put it down! Put it down! Put it down! Rory! Rory! Stand your men down! Rory, stand your men down! - Come out. Come on. Shut your hole! Rory, stand your men down! Grab their guns! How many? - Come on! - Four. Fucking turncoats! Now, put your gun down, I say! Put it down! Come on! Put it down! Jesus Christ, Rory! What are you doing? Shut up! I've a good mind to do you all. Come on, hurry up! Move it! You've just killed two fellow Irishmen! Tell that to your boys in the Four Courts! Come on, move it! What's it like to kill an Irishman, then? Oh, shut your hole! Come on, move it. Come on! You loafer! Bloody Rory, he's insane. Some bastards are beyond reason. Self-righteous Rory, with his big, thick head on him. He's quite content being the miserable underdog. - You do know that? - I do, indeed. Jesus. The military courts. That'll show them. It's not enough. What are you saying? If they take one out, we take one back. To hell with the courts. Jesus, Teddy, they're still our boys out there. They're confused. They'll run out of steam. Some will. Some will fight to the end. I agree. We gotta stamp it out. If we don't stop them, the Brits will be back. After all we've achieved, after everything we've been through, we can't go back to that. I never thought I'd see the day. Military courts established in Ireland by Irishmen. Deportation or the death penalty for those caught with arms. In the name of God, what is going on? I found this on the street during the week. "Under the Republic, "the lands of the aristocracy, who live in luxury in London, "will be seized and divided up "against landless workers and small farmers. "All industry and agriculture will be controlled by the state for the workers' and farmers' benefit." Not content with stealing your savings, they'll be nationalizing the Twelve Apostles next. My dear brethren, we have an opportunity for the first time in generations in this country for peace and prosperity. We have that opportunity without English soldiers marching up and down our streets and outside our churches on a Sunday morning. We have that opportunity because we have signed a treaty. A treaty of peace. Quiet! Let me remind those of you who have forgotten of the pastoral letter signed by Cardinal Logue and other bishops. "Anti-treatyite irregulars have," and I quote, "wrecked Ireland from end to end. "And all those who participate in such crimes "are guilty of the gravest sins "and may not be absolved in confession nor admitted to Holy Communion." In other words, excommunication. And this opinion of the treaty is not just the opinion of the Catholic Church. It is the opinion of other churches! And it is the opinion of every newspaper up and down and the length and breadth of this country. But most importantly, this treaty was ratified, overwhelmingly ratified, by the people in their democratic expression in the June election! Can you tell me, Father, how there can be a fair election in this country when the most powerful country in the world threatens war? This is not the will of the people. It is the fear of the people. How dare you talk to me in the house of God! Silence! Damien O'Donovan, you're a disgrace to the memory of your parents! Yes! Get out! The Free State constitution was only printed the morning of the election, - so nobody had time to read it! - Young lady, this is not the marketplace! Sit down, shut up, or get out of my church! And once again, the Catholic Church, with honorable exception, sides with the rich! Get out! Yes, Get out Get Out1 We should have known. Damien! Damien! Please! Come on, boy. What... I just want a word, you know? What are you doing, man? You're fighting with the parish priest now. It's not bad enough we're fighting amongst ourselves, huh? Huh? And what's it all for? Well said, Damien. This... This radical shit? Who in the countryside is going to read this? Have you read it, Teddy? - Look at our own... - Have you? Damien, our own uncles in their own farms, - they're scared of this stuff. - Our own uncles? They're not waving little red flags! Have you forgotten how they behaved, have you? And our own father when he fired Pat McCarthy because he was sick, and we couldn't even look at his son in the face because of the shame of it? What has our father got to do with this, Damien? Look, Teddy, there's one in four people out of work in this country, right? I have seen children and... and families starving. Do we expect them to head off to New York and London like before? Is that what we fought for? But we didn't fight for this, Damien! Look, it's too late, Teddy! You're not gonna convince me! You've always been a dreamer, Damien. I am not a dreamer. I am a realist, Teddy. I need you with me on this, Damien. I swear, we'll tear up the treaty once we're strong enough, but I need you to... to be with me on this. You're... I mean, you're my... Just give me time. Give this... Give this a chance. It's too late, Teddy. You can't see it, boy. You really can't see it. John Bull has his hand down your pants and his fist round your bollocks, - and you can't see it. - That's not it, Damien. - This treaty, Teddy, this treaty... - It's not like that. This treaty makes you a servant of the British Empire. You have wrapped yourself in the fucking Union Jack. The butcher's apron, boy. Where's Rory, Damien? Hey, don't do anything stupid, Damien. Do you realize you've been telling me that since I was 12 years of age? First man! Outhouse! Second man! Outhouse! You two in the main house! Last man with me! Move it! Get over there! Get over! Get out of the house! Get out of the house! Get outta the way! Get outta the way! - What's going on here? - Weapons search! We have no weapons here. You'll find no weapons here. What's going on inside here? Soldier, get this woman against the wall! Get out of the house! I want you over there against that wall! - How could you do this? - Come on, come on! Get over! After all the times we gave you food and shelter! - Up those steps! - It's a disgrace! Come on, up against the wall! You should be ashamed of yourself! Come on, back! Back up here! Go on, in together where I can see the two of you. All the times you sat at our table, eating our food. We gave you shelter. Orders from headquarters. To turn on your own people. Orders from the government of the Free State. Come on, lads. I'll show you where the weapons are. Sean, watch the door. Come on. Sentry, what's going on up there? Nothing, sir! Sentry, make a report! There's nothing going on down here, Sir! Halt, or I'll fire! Aah! Uhh! Aah! Dan! Dan! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! - Hold your fire! Dan is down, lads! - Shut up! - Shut up! Shut up! - Hold your fucking fire! - Dan is shot, lads! - Shut up! - I'm unarmed! I'm fucking ... - Dan! - No! - Uhh! - No! No, don't... No! Just... stop it, boy! Get your hands up! Get your hands up, you bastard! Get 'em up! Get 'em up! Get your hands up! I tell you, get 'em up! - Get 'em up! - Okay! That's enough! Get back! Get back! Dan! - Dan! Dan! - Desist! - Get back, I said! - Dan! - Get back! - Dan! Dan! Fucking ... - Jesus Christ, you fucking bastards! - Get outta this hall! Unarmed man! You shot an unarmed man in the back, Denis! Shut up! - Huh? You shot Dan! - Damien, get your hands up... - Dan! ...or I will shoot! Has he eaten? No, he's been very quiet, sir. Remember the last time we were here? You told them you were me. I never thanked you for that. For all the good it did you. I'm sorry about Dan. And Terence? Where are they now? They're in the basement. Lying side by side. Jesus, Damien, you shouldn't be in here. You should be back home. Back home with Sinead. And tomorrow morning, you should be in a hospital, teaching. Sure, that's all you've ever wanted to do since you were a boy, isn't it? Hmm? You were always the brighter one. Better student by a mile. You've Sinead there. She loves you. And you're meant for each other. You should have... sons and daughters, and teach them to be gentle and... and happy. I want out of this uniform, Damien. I want peace. We need people like you and even the likes of me to make that happen. Damien, I've never begged another human being in my life. But I'm going to beg you now... heart and soul. Just brother to brother. What do you want, Teddy? Tell us where the arms are, Damien. Take amnesty. Go home and live the life you should be living. And we want Rory. But you talk to his boys. They'll listen to you. You listen to me. I shot... Chris Reilly... in the heart. I did that. You know why? I'm not going to sell out. You better write your letters, Damien. Tell us where the arms are... or you will be shot at dawn. Did he say anything, Teddy? Hup! Hup! Left... turn! Left. Left. Left, right, left. Right... turn! Halt! Put your back up against the post. Forward... march! Left. Left. Left. It's not too late, Damien. For me or for you? No. If you don't want to do this, I'll give the order. I'll do it. Squad! Attention! Get ready! - Load! Take aim! Mmmhh! Fire! Order arms. Sinead? Sinead! Sinead. What's the matter? What's wrong? There's this also. No, Sinead. - No, Sinead. - No! No! No, Si... Oh, Sinead. Sinead. - You... big... - Uhh. Uhh. Get out! Leave me! Get off my land! I don't ever want to see you again! Oh... Ohhh... Oh, Damien, no. Oh, no.
