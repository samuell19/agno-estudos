(suspenseful music) (lively rock music) - I'd almost forgotten how beautiful it could be. Hold me. - I'm right here, honey. (Ben sighs) - You may not believe this but all those months you were away in the war, there was never anybody else. It was always you, Ben. Don't you believe me? - Sure, honey. - You don't sound like you believe me. - You know, for someone that's out of practice, you do very well. - You're awful. You haven't changed a bit. - That's right. Mmm, that's nice, well worth riding over a thousand miles for. - You're a bastard. - It was meant as a compliment. - Well, I didn't think it was funny. - I'm sorry. - I know you, Ben. What's bothering you. Couldn't have been the war. Hell, you shot more men before you joined up than most men in the army. Now that it's over, why don't you stay here with me and settle down? Ben? Ben, it's your wife, isn't it? It's Mary. She's dead, Ben, and there's nothing in the world you can do about it. It's almost a year now. Live amongst the living, Ben. Ben, listen to me. Please, Ben, listen to me. You could build a new life for yourself, for us. Takes guts to live among the living. What makes you think Mary was so different and so pure? She was a woman just like me. (Val grunts) (dramatic music) - Ben Thompson, peace officer, (somber music) who remains alive only because of his deadliness, rides on the trail of a Yaqui chief called Satago and his heart filled with hate. As I ride beside him, as I do with all men on my pale horse, I'm Ben Thompson's close friend, Death, the physician who cures all pain. For the next five bloody days I ride with my mortal messenger Ben Thompson collecting the debt all men must pay. (somber music) (tense music) Yaqui Chief Satago slaughters the white man and woman in the name of justice for his people. The white man has killed his game, driven his tribe from their hunting ground, (Yaqui whooping) and broken every treaty. Where Satago goes, I am, for he, too, is my messenger and death is his way of life. (guns firing) (Yaqui whooping) (rifle firing) (dynamic music) (man screaming) - Ben Thompson. - Lightfoot, Joe Lightfoot. - Yeah, I've heard of you. - Here, I think I owe you something. - No, some information. How come Indians are chasing Indians? - (chuckles) My half brother, Satago. Well, he's a big Yaqui chief now and he's trying to run all the white men outta the territory. Got guns, too, lots of 'em. - Where'd he get 'em? - Gun runners. - Well, that's neighborly. What's he after you for? Is that his squaw? You running away with her? - That's my squaw and he wants her. If we don't get outta the territory soon, he's gonna kill both of us. - Well, then maybe you better get. - (chuckles) Happy hunting. (tense music) - [Death] The five bloody days have their beginning. The hatred between Ben Thompson and Satago creates a holocaust of violence during which these two messengers of mine each seeks revenge. (somber music) (tense music) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) In this grave lies Ben Thompson's bride, Mary, delivered to me by an arrow from the bow of Satago on her wedding day. Weep not for her, she's found peace. No yesterdays to regret, no today to endure, and no tomorrows to fear. When sweet Mary Thompson died, all of the love within the heart of Ben Thompson was buried with her for he's Mary's husband forever. Even I, Death, cannot part this man and this woman. (rifle firing) (dynamic music) (dramatic music) (rifle firing) (tense music) (tense jazzy music) - Ben! - Relax, Nora, don't fight him. Yaqui has body of woman. (Nora grunting) (suspenseful music) (Yaqui man grunting) (tense music) (somber music) - Ben. Ben. - Yeah? - You all right? - Yeah. - Oh, it looks bad. Think you can stop the bleeding? - Yeah, I gotta clean it first. How's your neck. - Oh, it stings. - Could you get me my canteen and my gun belt? - Sure, okay. (romantic music) - Here, let me use your scarf. (wind whistling) Well, we'll put some whiskey on it. The air will heal it. - Still stings. (Ben sighs) Thanks, Ben, thanks for everything. Here, let me help you. - Oh, just pour it in, wash the sand out. What the hell are you doing out here alone? - Alone? Oh, Dave's in Tucson. He'll be back tomorrow. - Dave, Dave Miller? - I guess you hadn't heard. I married Dave just after you left for the war. Why didn't I hear from you, Ben? - You know why. - I thought I meant something to you. - Look, I told you in the beginning it wouldn't work. - Mary? - [Ben] Mmm hmm. - She's dead, Ben. - You know I oughta be in that grave or her killer. - Mary wouldn't want you to feel that way. She'd want you to live not just exist. Remember, Ben, "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord." - Yeah. - Well, there's no use trying to talk any sense into you once you've got your mind made up. - That's right. You know this country's crawling with small bands of renegade Apaches. The Mexicans call 'em Yaquis, worst kind of Apache. Rather scalp a white man than chase a squaw. I hope Dave makes it. - He'll make it. - Well, I better stay with you till he gets back. _ okay- (gentle music) (tense music) (birds chirping) Ben, are you asleep? - [Ben] Yep- - (chuckles) Would you like your coffee poured on your foot? - [Ben] No, ma'am. - (chuckles) Did you sleep all right? - Yeah. Best a fella can with one eye open. - Did you hear anything? - No, it's been quiet, too quiet. (horse hooves clomping) - [Nora] It's Dave. Hello, Dave. - Well, hello, Thompson. What brings you around these parts? - Just passing through. - Two Yaquis tried to take me home for a plaything. Ben here happened by just in time. One cut his leg and look what they did to my neck. (tense drumming music) - So you came by here to celebrate the big event. - Oh, hold it, Dave. I came by to warn you. The whole countryside is being torn up by renegade Apache. You're lucky you made it back from town. I'm on my way to Tombstone. I think you and Nora better travel with me. - I been living here for five years, Ben. Ain't never had no trouble with Indians. Besides I got my traps to tend to. - Dave, don't you believe us? - These aren't just Indians, they're Yaquis. - Well, if you're goin' then get 'cause I don't want your kind hanging around here OI" my woman. (cup clanging) - Don't pay him any mind, Ben. His feelings are hurt. - So are mine. I wanted the rest of that coffee. Thanks. Believe me, Nora, I've seen Indian signs for the last three days. You and Dave better get to town till the army can chase 'em back across the border. (thunder cracking) Well, looks like a storm coming up. I better get moving. - Why don't you wait till it blows over, Ben? When will I see ya again? - Well, who knows. Maybe Tucson some day. - Yeah, maybe. - And if I come back through this area, I expect to see a lotta young'uns running around. Oh, and tell Dave he owes me a cup of coffee. - Okay, I'll do that. (somber music) Goodbye, Nora. - Dave, you're so stubborn. Why don't you believe me? Ben saved my life. That's the only thing that happened. - I'm sick and tired of hearing about you and Ben Thompson. - [Nora] Where are you goin'? - I'm going up to Twin Creeks and check my traps. - But, Dave... (suspenseful music) (tense music) (Yaqui whooping) (Yaqui whooping) (tense music) - Look out behind you! (rifle firing) (rifle firing) (gun firing) (rifles firing) (Yaqui whooping) (rifle firing) (arrow thudding) (Nora gasping) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Nora, I... - I know, Dave. (gentle music) (Yaqui whooping) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (Yaqui whooping) (fire crackling) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - [Death] Gun runners are my messengers also. The arms they sell to the Yaqui are instruments of pre-ordained death. Each man has his appointed day. I'm with you and all men constantly. (wind whistling) - We got rifles. (slow suspenseful music) You got gold? - [Yaqui Man] For rifles and horse. Two days. (dramatic music) - What'd he make them signs for, Clay? - Well, it ain't because they like us, I can tell you that. He just give us two days to get outta the territory. - Two days, then what? - Supper, supper for ants, that's one way. - Ants for supper, oh no. - Oh, shut your yap. - You mean we're the supper? - That's right, we're the supper, Horace. (dramatic music) (tense music) (slow suspenseful music) (Joe grunting) (dramatic music) - What happened? (somber music) - Ambush. Two of 'em jumped me. (chuckles) They're still there. - They get your squaw? - She's safe back at camp. Went out for some food and got the buck. Two Yaquis got me. - Better fix you up, get you back to your woman. I don't think this territory's any too friendly. Take a bite. See those buzzards? Let's take a look. (dramatic music) (lively music) - Well, well, look what old Santy Claus left us, Horace. - Yeah, that's a mighty fine toy, Clay. - Yeah, sure is. - [Little Fawn] Satago, Satago. - Well, I guess it wasn't Santa Claus after all. It's our old friend Satago. - How come he didn't kill her? - You know Satago. Leaves 'em for the ants and the vultures. Mighty pretty. - Yeah. I think I'll take a better look. - Yeah, I'll go with you. - You stay right where you are and take care of the horses. - Clay, I wanna see! - I'll do all the seein'. (tense music) Yeah. Yeah. (Little Fawn panting) (fabric ripping) - Satago, Satago. (fabric ripping) - Yeah, it's pretty good. (Little Fawn crying) (Satago panting) (Little Fawn grunting and crying) (somber music) (Little Fawn crying) - Now you hold the horses, Clay. (gun firing) Clay, what'd you do that for? - She would have liked you anyway, Horace. (Clay laughing) - Well, I'm gonna get me somethin'. - [Clay] Come on, Horace, let's get movin'. - I'm gonna get me somethin'. - [Clay] I said come on! - Looks like silver around her neck. (suspenseful music) That pretty, Clay? - Yeah, let me see it. I'll just keep this for a little memento. Take it easy, Horace, take it easy. Ho! - And don't call me Horace! (dramatic music) Ah! (somber music) (sad music) (horse whinnying) - [Death] So Little Fawn came to me. And the manner of her dying has given me another earthly disciple. As Joe Lightfoot carries the clay of his love to her final rest, his troubled mind is filled with despair, vengeance, and dedication to me. (Yaqui whooping) (rifle firing) (dramatic music) (tense music) (Yaqui whooping) (rifle firing) (rifle firing) (rifles firing) (Yaqui whooping) (Lavina crying) (rifles firing) (Yaqui whooping) (rifles firing) (Yaqui grunting) (rifles firing) (Yaqui whooping) (tense music) - Well, it looks like they let up for a while. Can't be too many of 'em. They'd been on top of us over an hour ago. - Jim, I need... - Oh shut your yap! - Mr. Wade, that's no way to talk. - Only kinda talk she understands. (wind whistling) (Lavina sniffles) Quit that sniffing, will ya? I'll hang your fanny over that wagon for a target. - I Will, Jim, I'll try. - Well, you damn well better. You know I can always trade your bloomers in for a much better pair. - Well, he's right, Lavina. Try and pull yourself together. - Do you know what Indians do to white women? - Well now, that kinda thinkin' just ain't gonna help. - I know. (soft drumming music) But I can't help it. I, I'm scared. (wind whistling) - (grunts) Thank you. Thank you, my fair maiden. May the good Lord reward your kindness. - Althea ain't no maiden, Boone. - You're welcome, Mr. Hawkins. - Don't you trouble your pretty head about Kelly, daughter. Retribution shall be his from the mighty hand on high. - Oh, I guess I'm used to it now. - Oh, you don't ever need to get used to the ways of the devil. It's never too late to wash yourself clean. - I don't feel dirty, Mr. Hawkins. - Face your sins then ask forgiveness from the Almighty. Then and only then can you find true happiness. _ rm happy enough. - With the help of the Lord, everything can change in the future. No more clouds, only sunshine. - He doesn't handle the weather that way. But thanks for trying. If you wanna pray for something, pray for help. (gentle music) - [Man] Thanks. (lighthearted music) - (chuckles) You weren't always a preacher, were you, Boone. (wind whistling) - JezebeL (Kelly laughing) (horse hooves clomping) - Look, out there. Couple of riders coming in fast. - The Lord has answered my request. - [Death] One should be careful for what one prays. (guns firing) Boone Hawkins did not pray for forgiveness. He prayed for help. And Ben Thompson, my angel of death, will bring to these troubled people (rifle firing) not the burden of continued life, but the promise of everlasting peace. (Jim laughing) - One dead Yaqui. (Yaqui whooping) Well, I'll be damned, Ben Thompson. (rifles firing) (gun firing) (Yaqui whooping) - Nice shootin', Jim. - Stack my deck, Ben Thompson. (guns firing) Hold it, hold it. They're outta range now. (exhaling heavily) - What are you doing out here, Jim, having a party? (Jim laughing) _ SQme party. Ah, they made a mistake, Ben. Run me outta Tucson along with the ladies here. Got this far when we got hit by these Yaquis, lost our horses. How 'bout you? Still tracking that same fella, huh? - That's right, Jim. Picked up Joe on the trail. - Yeah, I heard about the half breed. You plan to make him a permanent partner? - Nothing permanent with me except death. - Hey, fancy bloomers, I wanna talk to you. - Quit makin' eyes at my man. - Lavina, I don't know what... - Just stay away from him, you understand? - Look, I don't know what you're talking about. - Who's the brown-haired filly? - You mean the little wildcat? That's Althea. Works for Kansas Kelly. (Lavina grunting) (tense music) The blonde's with me. - Better take care of that wound, Joe. Be back in a minute. (women grunting) (Ben chuckling) - Break it up, come on, let's block it. - Here, kid, I think you're gonna need these. (wind whistling) - Hello, Kansas. - Hello, Ben, glad to see you. - How do you like the war? - Think we'll get outta here still wearin' our hair? - Well, if it doesn't get too hot. - I lost a lotta beaus to her. - Not you, Kansas. See ya later. - Drop by, I'll buy ya a drink. - Same saloon? - You bet, honey. (both chuckling) (iaZZy music) (Ben clears throat) - What are you doing there? - Merely answering the great call of nature, no more, no less. May I return to the wagon now? - Go ahead. (wind whistling) Maybe you oughta change closer to the wagon. - How long have you been watching me? - (chuckles) Not long enough. Did you want me to knock? - Next time, please do, mister. - Thompson, Ben Thompson. - Oh, of course. I should have recognized you by your splendid attire and manners. - I'm sure my manners didn't start that fight. (Ben chuckles) I wouldn't worry about it, miss. All the gals fight over Jim. (rocks clattering) Well, that's a pretty dress. Did you make it yourself? - You know very well this is a dress I work in. Are you really interested in clothes, Mr. Thompson? - The name's Ben and right now I am. - I must say by the looks of your outfit, you must have an excellent tailor. - (chuckles) Well, clothes are kinda like a gun, ma'am. You only change 'em when they're worn out. (tense music) (gun firing) (Yaqui grunting) - My God, Ben. How long did you know he was up there? - Be quiet, be very quiet. (wind whistling) - What does it mean, Ben. - They think we're trapped. Maybe we are. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (wolf howling) (wolf howling) (Lavina screams) (Lavina screams) - What the hell is going on? - What is it, what's the matter? - Jim, Jim, I had the worst dream. - What? - A nightmare, I dreamed that we were hung... - I'll give you nightmares. (slaps thudding) (Lavina grunting) (bottle shattering) Ooh. - I hope you didn't hurt him. - Can't stand to see a man mauling a gal. - Jim, Jim, are you all right? - Sure he's all right. I been cracking skulls for years. Finish your love-making in the morning, honey. Night, Boone, pleasant dreams. - Animals, animals (huffs). - Well, that was awful, Ben. - Jim and Lavina? Jim's been doing that for years. Most women like it. - Do you think a woman is a possession like a horse, like your friend over there? - Who said Jim was my friend? Besides he won Lavina in a poker game. (Ben sighs) - Have you ever been in love? (romantic music) - Once. She's dead. - And that was enough? - Uh huh. And you? - He got the gold fever, left me. What happened to you? - She got shot. Good night. (light suspenseful music) How's your shoulder? _ okay- - Wanna go out and count some noses? - Yeah, might be better than waiting here. - Hold it. Hey, Jim. - What is it? - Here, take over. This'll keep the... - Wait a minute, where you going? - I don't like cooling my heels. Can't be many more of them out there. I'll be back. - Ben. Be careful. - Don't worry, I'll be here. (suspenseful music) - [Death] I moved beside these two vengeful men toward the objects of their hatred. And only I know how many shall die. (Yaqui grunting) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (Yaqui grunting) (guns firing) (horse whinnying) (guns firing) - Son of a... You all right? - Yeah, I guess so. Thanks, partner. Some day I'll return the favor. - We better get back to the wagon and fix your shoulder. I think we can all move out now. (tense drumming music) - Well, well, look over there. A corral with fillies in it. (birds chirping) Shall we? - Definitely, definitely. (Clay laughing) Looks good to the fox. Very good. - Let's go. Come on, boy. Come on. (wind whistling) - You lost? - Not always. - Yeah, not always. - Where you headed? - Tombstone. - Yeah, Tombstone. - Will you shut up? - Yeah, shut up. Mmm, sorry, Clay. - First name's Clay. What's the last? - Bates, Clay Bates. - Wiggins, Horace Wiggins. Ho. - What happened to your wing? - I bit it. - What'd you do that for? - Because he was hungry, stupid. - We need your horses for these women. - Water's low and the walk is long. - I don't give up my horse to no man or woman. - Well, I'd be glad to. - All right, stupid, enjoy the walk. (Jim clicking) (suspenseful music) Come on. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (light drumming music) - Come on. - We'll rest the horses. - The horses? What about my fanny, Ben? - What about it? - It's sorer than hell. - I'm sure not for the first time. Joe, help the lady down. - Ben, we're way off the main trail. - We're headed for an old mining trail up in the rocks. We may be able to fool the Yaquis and get through the side, it's a little shorter. We'll rest for a while and move out. - Well, I'm going down the river a little way, Joe. Come on along, I'll fix a new bandage for you. - Don't let that nurse get tangled up in that bandage. - I'll be careful. Reporting as ordered, Doctor. - Under the circumstances, Joe, welcome to my bathtub. Got a handkerchief? - No. - Well, take off your shirt. - You're the doctor. Arm's a little stiff though. - Sit still, I'll do it. How long have you known Ben? - Five days. Heard about him for years. - So have I. Strange man. Doesn't seem to have a heart. - Can't afford to have one. It been dead a long time ago. Feeling's get a man in a lotta trouble. - You men are all alike. - Don't do no good to love a dead man. Or a woman. - You've had a good life, Joe. Death doesn't matter. - What are you gonna do, Ben, set up smoke signals for the Indians? - I'm settin' up a dummy camp. - You keep my horse for a woman, Ben. I've got something I gotta do. (suspenseful music) - [Clay] How's the water, beautiful? - G0 away! Put my clothes down! - You, you come up here and get 'em, huh? - [Lavina] Put 'em down. Put my clothes down! - I want you, beautiful, I want you real bad, hear? Look what I got for ya. L'll give you this, huh? Come on (chuckles). - Show's over, Bates! (punches thudding) (Clay grunting) Here, here's your clothes. Put 'em on, get outta that water. More damn trouble than you're worth. - I'm sorry, Jim. - You're always sorry about something. (arrow thudding) (Lavina gasping) - Jim, Jim. (gun firing) - Lavina! (dramatic music) (gentle drumming music) - We are gathered here this morning to help a soul return to its eternal home. We ask you to forgive her sins. We shall remember Lavina Ray for her, well, for her beauty and her kindness and we ask you to give strength to Jim Wade at this time of his personal loss. (Kelly hiccups) Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. (wind whistling) Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. - I wonder how Jim really feels. - Over Lavina? - A poker game. - Well, we better move out. We got a long ride ahead. (emotional music) (suspenseful music) Stay here. Jim, you come with me. We'll go check out the trail. Joe, stay ready. - Horace, take my horse. Ah. (Clay sighs) - Clay, what you gotta drink so much for? - None of your damn business how much I drink, Horace. - Don't call me Horace. - All right, horse face, don't you get on my nerves. - I didn't mean to make you mad, Clay. I was just thinkin' that maybe we can make a deal with Satago for more guns. - Quiet, quiet! - All right, all right! But maybe we can take their guns to Satago and maybe just save our skins. - Yeah. And maybe that's just the best idea you ever had. Ah! (light drumming music) - Ah, Ben and Joe have been gone over an hour. There hasn't been a sound out there. I'm really worried. - Probably killed each other. - That's not funny. - Wasn't meant to be. They been sizing each other up for years like a couple of male cougars on the hunt. - Well, if anything happens to them, we don't have a prayer. - Huh! I'd rub me all over with berryjuice, go out there, and find me a handsome Yaqui buck. - Oh, Kelly! - Better than bein' dead, ain't it? - Not to me. - Relax, Althea. How about a snort? - No thank you. (sighs) How long have you known Ben? " Ben? Honey, no one really knows Ben Thompson. We got drunk together one night in Tucson. (somber music) Even when he's drunk he don't talk much. Best I could make out, his bride caught a bullet was meant for him. Come on, have a drink, forget about him. - No thanks. - Well, I'll indulge if you don't mind. If you do, you know I'll have one anyway. Would you like a little drink, Boone? - I don't need false courage. Ouch! Oh, Lord, thy servant's feet have trod a hard road. - Oh, Clay. Come on, Clay. (Clay grunts) Clay, Clay, wake up. - [Clay] I don't want to. _ Clay- - What? - Wake up. Clay. (slaps thudding) (dramatic music) - [Boone] Wiggins, Wiggins, control yourself. - [Horace] Clay! Clay, Clay! (Clay grunting) - Wiggins, control yourself! - Clay. (Clay grunting) - Stop it, you'll kill him! - Let him. (suspenseful music) - Drop the gun, half breed. Drop it! I'll plug the girl. - I can't allow this. (light drumming music) - Shut your mouth, preacher. - You're putting all our lives in extreme danger, Mr. Wiggins. If nothing else think of yourself. - Shut up, preacher man. You'll get a bullet between your teeth. - Huh, one of us or all of us is about to die. Surely we can take time to speak with our maker. - Then shut up! You thought you're smart, didn't you, Clay? Well, I'm smarter than you. I'm smarter than anybody here. I'm gonna take them rifles and I'm going to Satago, save my skin. - "Well, God so loved the world that he gave "his only begotten son to the end "that all that believe on him should not perish "but have everlasting life." (gun firing) " may! - Joe! - Joe! - He's the one that killed my wife. - (chuckles) Well, you sure made a believer outta him, Boone. - Why, Boone Hawkins, you're downright amazing. - You were right. I wasn't always a preacher. (lively music) - [Death] Why does he run? Each man at his moment of dying hopes forjust a little more time to right the wrongs he has done. But time is of no importance to me. When a man's day arrives, I take him. And what he has done before is done without hope or change. (somber drumming music) (wind whistling) - No, no! (suspenseful music) (Clay panting) (gun clicking) - Thought you'd like to know my wife's name was Little Fawn. - Little Fawn? Who the hell is Little Fawn? (suspenseful piano music) (slow suspenseful music) - Little Fawn. - What's that? I never saw it before. I found it out in the desert. - Wanna thank you for shooting her. You're gonna find out that death by ants is very slow. - No, no! No, I don't wanna die this way! No, no! (dramatic music) Come on, no! No! (slow drumming music) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (Joe groaning) No. No! No! (wind whistling) (slow drumming music) (Joe panting) (tense music) (Yaqui whooping) (wind whistling) (arrows thudding) (Joe gasping) (Joe grunting) (tense music) (Joe panting) (wind whistling) - Listen, Ben, we gotta move out. Our backs are wide open. - Joe will make it, I know he will. - That's his worry, we can't wait. (somber music) (tense music) (Boone grunts) (gun firing) (Kelly gasps) (gun firing) (gun firing) (rifle firing) (dramatic music) (tense music) - Jim. - Oh, quit more on me, Ben, will ya? I shoulda known better. I'm a guy that never kept his back to the door. (Jim grunts) - Take it easy, Jim. - Oh, don't mother me, will ya? (Jim panting) You know I always thought I'd get it in some gambling hall or some bedroom (chuckles). Well, here I am (chuckles). Off of some goat trail (chuckles). Oh, life's full of funny switchbacks, ain't it? Yes, it's funny, it's really a laugh (laughing). (Jim coughing) - [Ben] Save your breath. - You better save yours. You're gonna need it, Ben. And listen, if you're dumb enough to waste time burying me, I promise ya, I'll come back and haunt ya. (somber music) - [Death] Why do all the others die while Ben Thompson, who seeks death, is denied me? Because his services as my earthly messenger have not yet been finally accomplished. (majestic music) (tense music) (quick suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - [Althea] Ben, look out! (rifle firing) (Althea grunts) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (Yaqui screaming) - Oh my God, Althea, no. (wind whistling) - Do you care? Do you, Ben? - Althea. - No. That would make you weak. You're strong. I'm weak. And if I hadn't, rub my head. - We'll make it, together. Together we'll make it. - It's too late, Ben. We met (grunts) too late. (tense jazzy music) (Ben grunts) (lively drumming music) (Ben grunts) (men grunting) - [Death] Here in this vast silent valley in the setting which might well be the end or the beginning of the world, these two men, each of whom is certain of the justice and honor for which he does battle, meet in a final confrontation. (tense music) One of them will come to me, the other will ride on seeking me. For in violence between men and nations there can be but one victor. And that is death. (punches thudding) (Satago grunting) (gentle music) (wind whistling) Ben Thompson served me well. As he rides away from this bloody valley, his friends and his enemies have found their ultimate destiny. I ride beside him on my pale horse for I am Death. And if I didn't exist, it'd be necessary to invent me. For only I can cure the pain of living. Only I can show each living thing that dying is nothing more than ceasing to be afraid. (dramatic music)
