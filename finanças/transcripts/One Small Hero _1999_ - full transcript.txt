[ Boy ] "We done it this time, Thor. "With this key to the nuclear reactor, "no one will be able to stop us. We'll rule the world!" "Not so fast, gentlemen. I'm afraid your wicked plan... and evil intentions are all washed up." "Who are you and what are you doing here?" "I'm Coolman, and I'm your downfall." [ Knocking ] Yeah, Mom? 7:00, Joey. [ Panting ] [ Grunting ] [ Straining ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Grunts, Sighs ] See that, Dad? No stopping me now. I'm outta here, Mom. Not so fast, sport. Your breakfast. Your lunch. And your permission slip for the club tryouts. You will make it this time, Joey. I know you will. It's just like your father used to say-- "You can do anything you set your mind to." About time. Sorry. So, you really gonna go through with it? The tryouts? Uh-huh. What? Do you like humiliation? You've tried three times and failed. All the kids laugh at you. Why do you even wanna be in the wilderness club anyway? 'Cause it's cool. They're going backpacking in the mountains on Easter vacation. And I wanna go. Backpacking? Like when you carry everything with you on your back? You'll never make it. You're too small. I'm not too small. And I am gonna make it this time. I've been working out, and I'm much stronger. [ Scoffs ] Hey, check it out. Just 'cause her dad's the senator, the girl gets driven to school in a limo. Rough life. I think her dad's out of town a lot. You know, her mom too. For work. Maybe that's why she has to be driven. Thanks. - Hey, Joey. - Hey, Sarah. Not in this lifetime, Cooper. She's out of your league. Hey, Sarah, wait up. What's his problem? I don't know. [ School Bell Ringing ] Jo-Jo. Yes? I have a detention during lunch again, so in case I don't see you, good luck after school. Thanks, Timmy. [ Whistle Blowing ] All right, everybody, gather in. Let's settle in. All right, gather around. I'm glad to see so many of you out here today. Being in the wilderness club is a great thing. A chance to make good friends and learn survival skills. And the trip we have planned this year is our best trip ever. [ All Cheering, Shouting ] All right, the tryouts today are designed to test your skills... and see how well you work with others. 'Cause when you're out in the wilderness... with only what you can carry on your back, all you really have is each other. And the kids who are already in the club are here to help take you through the paces. This is Sarah and Reese, Cody and Moose. As you already know, unfortunately, we only have room for two new members on our trip this year. So do your best. Good luck, and may the best kids win. Let's go! [ Whistle Blows ] [ Chattering ] - [ Whistle Blows ] - [ Children Shouting ] [ Whistle Blows ] [ Shouting Continues ] [ Boy ] You got it, man. - Okay, next. - [ Sarah ] Come on, Joey. Come on. You can do it. Come on. Just think about it. Bar by bar. [ Children Chattering ] [ Cheering ] [ Boy ] Come on. You can do it. [ Children Cheering ] Next. Go! Done! Good job, Joey. [ Mutters ] [ Cheering ] I can do anything I set my mind to. [ Children Cheering ] Come on, Cooper! We don't have all day. Hurry up already. Come on, Joey. You can do it. Come on. You're almost there. Just think about it. [ Cheering ] [ Sarah ] Come on, Joey. God, Cooper, get out of here. [ Whistle Blows ] I saw a lot of great effort and spirit out there. And if you didn't make it, I hope you'll try again. And now for the lucky two who did make it, I'm proud to announce... that the new members of the wilderness club are-- Joey Cooper. Joey Cooper. Joey Cooper. Amelia Lane and Billy Wong. [ Cheering ] [ Chattering, Laughing ] Uh, Coach, I don't know if you realize this, but it was Joey Cooper's fourth time trying out. I think he really wants to go on this trip. Couldn't we make room for one more and let him in? Joey Cooper? Who wants him? He's a weakling and a chicken. He'll just slow us down. He'll never be able to keep up with us. I'm sorry, Sarah, but it's impossible. We just don't have the room. And Reese is right. Joey's just too small. He doesn't have the strength he'd need to make the trip... and would just slow us down. [ Chattering Continues ] Surprise! What do you think? What is all this stuff? It's for your trip. Huh? With the club. I know how hard you've been working. And I was so sure you'd make it this time... that I went ahead and bought you a tent and all the equipment. But, Mom, we can't afford this. Don't you worry about that, honey. I've been saving for a long time. But, Mom, I can't. Of course you can. You deserve to have the best of everything. But I-- I'm so proud of you, Joey. And your father would have been too. So what do you think? You gonna be the best backpacker on this trip, or what? The best. "Local fireman saves three lives. Dies a hero." Maybe it's better that you're not here, Dad. Maybe you would have been embarrassed of me, or ashamed. I'm not like you, Dad. I'm no hero. I'm just a wimp. Why couldn't I be more like you? - Psst. - Come on. I don't know what I'm gonna do, Timmy. I've been thinking about it for three weeks. - And now I gotta come up with something. - Why not just tell the truth? I can't. I don't want her to know I failed again. Well, if you want, I could ask my mom if you could stay at my house. No, don't do that. Then your mom would call my mom, and it would be all out. Well, where are you gonna go? - I don't know. - [ Knocking ] You better go. Okay. Oh, and, Joey, take care of yourself. Thanks, Timmy. Yeah, Mom? You ready to go? All set. I'll go get the car. Um, that's okay, Mom. I think I'll walk. All the way to the van? Gotta start with those survival skills sometime. Might as well be now. Well, let me help you on with your pack. You know what you look like? Like a boy ready for an adventure. Okay. Have a good time, honey. Don't worry about a thing, okay? See you in a week. [ Chattering ] Billy, here. Help me take this. What's up, Reese? Whoa! Nice throw. Hi, Amelia. [ Amelia ] Hi, Coach. Oh, my God. [ Chattering ] [ Coach ] Okay, real quick. Real quick. [ Amelia ] Here comes Sarah. [ Chattering ] Okay, real quick. Real quick. Okay, let's have a meeting here. Gather around the truck. Over here, everybody. Everything all packed? [ Children ] Yeah. [ Reese ] Thanks to Moose and I. Said good-bye to your parents? [ Boys ] Yeah, yeah. [ Reese ] Can we go now? [ Chattering Continues ] Are we almost ready to go? [ Children ] Yes. All your bags are up there? Did you guys say good-bye to your parents? Give 'em a hug? [ Children ] Yeah. [ Coach ] Okay, wilderness club, one, two, three! [ All ] Let's go! Hurry up. Load up. [ Moose ] I got first seat. Nice job, Moose. [ Moose ] Sorry, Coach. You missed some. [ Children Chattering, Cheering ] [ Moose ] You're on the wilderness club! Shape up, people. Okay, everybody, let's go. [ Cheering ] [ Engine Starts ] [ Coach ] Ready to go?

Is this it? [ Moose ] What's going on? Is everybody all right? [ Children ] Yeah, yeah, we're fine. What happened? Just sit tight. I'm gonna check under the hood. Looks like it's on fire. It's smoking. [ Billy ] What's going on? Everything okay? Can I lend a hand? Sure. Anything you can do would be greatly appreciated. I'm afraid I don't know the first thing about cars. [ Chuckles ] Oh, wow. Oh, look at this. Looks like a bad hose. You know, my brother's a mechanic. Maybe he can fix it. Great. We're on our way to a backpacking adventure. I got a group of kids in the van. Hmm. Sure would be a shame to get stuck out here in the middle of nowhere... with no one to help, huh, Coach? This will be our little secret. You cooperate, and everything is gonna be okay. Baby! Bring the rope. Hurry. Tie him up. I suggest you cooperate. Tie him up in back, you idiot, not in front. What is this about? What do you want with us? You'll find out soon enough. You just do what we say, and no one's gonna get hurt, at least not too bad. You do whatever you want with me, but you leave those kids alone. Good work on rigging that hose, Baby. 'Bout time you did something around here right. Now put it back the way you found out so we can get out of here. Let's go. Now! Come on! Get in. Get in there. Sit down. Good afternoon, boys and girls. I've got your coach here and I'm gonna need a little cooperation. Let's just do what these men say and everything will be all right. Okay? Now, which one of you is Sarah Mann? [ Grunts ] I said, which one of you is Sarah Mann? Do I have to come in here and pull you all out one by one? Huh? [ Sarah ] I am. That's better. Come here. Get out. Baby, tie her up. Tie her up. Now, your little girlfriend and your coach, they're gonna ride up in the car with me. Baby's gonna follow in the van with the rest of you. Now, Baby, he's not such a great driver, if you know what I mean. So you better stay in your seats and not distract him. Understand? Good. Come on. Let's go. Come on! Come on! Shut that door. Let's go. This way. This way. Come on. Keep moving. [ Door Alarm Buzzing ] [ Buzzing Stops ] Hey, everybody. Here we go. [ Engine Starts ] Get in. Come on. Hurry up. Get your head in. Get in. Everybody, out. Stay close to the bus. Okay? Baby, get those packs unloaded. You have the kids bring theirs inside. You grab the teacher and the girl's packs. Now! Let's go. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Come on. Go up the steps. [ Gasps ] [ Billy ] Where are we? [ Reese ] Who knows? Do you guys have any idea what this is about? No clue. Okay, everybody go inside now. Here we go. Here we go, inside. [ Children Chattering ] [ Grunts ] [ Humming ] Don't take mine. Don't take mine. Don't take mine. [ Sighs ] [ Man ] All right, listen up and listen good. You're all probably wondering what you're doing here, so I'm gonna tell ya. But first, sit down! Not you. Now, we're gonna do this in an educational kind of way. Sort of like a civic lesson. A month ago, our brother was wrongly accused of robbing a bank. A terrible, terrible crime, which he never would have committed. At least not without our help. Who here knows what happens in our great country when you are accused of a crime? You have a trial? Right. And what happens there? - You're tried in front of a jury of your peers. - Correct. In theory. In theory, that is correct. In theory, innocent people should be found innocent, and guilty ones should be found guilty. And we'll all live happily ever after. God bless America. - What does this have to do with us? - I'm getting to that. Don't rush me. [ Slaps Hips ] Where was I? Guilty people should be found guilty. Ah. Right. If the system works, all should be fair. But sometimes the system makes mistakes. And that's what happened to our brother. You see, Conroy was found guilty. And now he is in prison for a very long time. And that ain't right. So, me and Baby here, we decided to do something about that. We decided to right this wrong. We decided to borrow little Sarah here-- Sit down! You see, she's the daughter of a U.S. senator-- a man of some influence. Now, when we're far into the wilderness, we're gonna make a call to the fine senator. We are gonna highly recommend that he pardon our brother Conroy, or at least get him released from prison. And if he cooperates, you will all be released unharmed. He'll never do it. Won't he? My father will never let you blackmail him. We'll see about that. We-We're not gonna hurt anybody. Right, Hutch? That-That's what you said. No one's gonna get hurt. No? That depends. If you kids listen to what I say, and you don't try nothing heroic, maybe I won't. But don't get me mad. Because I'm mean when I'm mad. And I can't be held responsible for my actions. Now if anybody's hungry, there's food over there. Class dismissed. Surely you'll untie us so we could eat and sleep. [ Chuckles ] We're not stupid. We don't know the way back, and we would die trying. Untie 'em. [ Hutch ] Come here. This is gonna be your home for the next few days. You didn't say anything about leaving me behind. I didn't say anything about a lot of things. Now, there's enough food and water in there to last you. We'll be back to let you out. Maybe. If not, c'est la vie. Let me out of here! You're not taking those kids anywhere without me! Baby, get those kids packed. I'm going out to the car. - [ Baby ] Okay, you guys, come on. Let's hurry up. - Let me outta here! You guys gotta listen to Hutch, okay? [ Trunk Door Closes ] All right, everybody, outside. Bring your stuff. Come on. Let's go. Now. Move it! Let me out of here! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. [ Panting ] Come on. Let's go. All right, everybody, we're going for a long walk today. And I don't want any stragglers. I'll take the lead. Baby will bring up the rear. And don't try to run, or someone will get hurt. So don't even think about it. All right, everybody, on with your packs. You! You stay up front with me. All right, let's go. Baby, get those packs. Come on. Let's go. Move it. Move it! Come on, Baby! We ain't got all day. Coach! Coach, can you hear me? It's me, Joey Cooper. Coach! Joey? Joey! Joey, listen to me! Go get help. But what about the other kids? Joey. Joey, go back home. Those guys are dangerous. They've got guns. This is no time to be a hero. Joey! Joey! We're just gonna do what this jerk up front tells us? You got a better idea? I think we should jump him. Or go for the phone. What if he has a gun or something? Okay, come on, guys. Come on. Let's go. Just hurry up. [ Hutch Shouts ] All right, pay attention. This bridge is only strong enough to hold one person at a time. - And there's a trick to getting across. - What's that? Don't trip. All right, let's see how well you follow instructions. Baby. I want you to go across first. Make sure these kids don't try anything funny. - Why me, Hutch? - Because I said so, stupid. Now go. Come on. Move. Sorry. Come on. Go. Move! [ Wood Creaking ] All right, Sarah, you stay with me. We're gonna cross last. You next. And remember, I ain't the rescuin' type. Now let's go. Come on. Come on. Go. [ Hutch ] All right, come on. Let's go. Let's go. This way. Come on. Go! Haven't we gone far enough? I mean, we've been walking all day. We're wiped. All right, I guess this will make an okay camp. Everyone, relax. You two, you go get some firewood. But you're not back in two minutes, I start pounding on your friends here. All right, everyone else, set up camp. I want a fire pit over there. You hit your tents up back a few yards. Not you, little Sarah. You're coming with me. I need your help. Time to make a phone call, and your voice is gonna come in very handy. [ Sarah Whimpers ] Let's go. [ Hutch ] Dial. What if I won't do it? What if I yank out all your pretty blonde hair strand by strand? Your brother's in jail. He must deserve to be there. My father will never have him released. [ Chuckles ] If I'd wanted your opinion, I'd ask for it! You won't get away with this. Yes, I will. Now you dial papa. He's at his office. I checked his schedule. [ Dialing ] Mrs. Bayden, this is Sarah Mann. I need to speak with my father. It's an emergency. Daddy, it's me, Sarah-- Senator Mann. I want you to listen and listen very carefully. My name is Hutch Flynn. My brother is Conroy Flynn. He's currently enjoying the generous hospitality... of the state corrections board, but not for long. I've got your daughter, her teacher and all the rest of the little kiddies. I've taken them to a very untraceable, very remote location. I've got four days' worth of supplies. Now, if my brother isn't released from prison by noon, exactly four days from now, your daughter and her little friends... will never be seen or heard from again. [ Senator ] You degenerate imbecile, what have you done with my daughter? That's for me to know and you to wonder. Now, do you understand your instructions? [ Senator ] Put her on the line. I want to talk to her now. Put Sarah on the line. Not this time, Senator. But I'll tell you what. You get the ball rolling, I'll see what I can do. Daddy! Daddy, don't do it! Don't do what he says! Shut up! That's all for now, Senator. Don't disappoint me. I hope he doesn't do it. I'd rather be fed to the hungry wolves than have him let your brother go. Now that is a distinct possibility, little girl. All right, let's go. Get this place set up. I want it set up now. You stay by me. Right here. ♪♪ [ Amelia, Sarah Chanting Rhythmically ] [ Humming ] [ Chanting Indistinctly ] [ Chanting Continues ] [ Bangs Ground ] Knock it off! [ Humming ] What's for dinner? Canned corn. Canned corn and, um, what? Just canned corn, Hutch. [ Exhales Sharply ] What? You said buy something that's easy to cook. And canned corn's easy to cook. You just heat it up. You moron! What'd you bring for tomorrow? Canned corn. [ Groans ] You idiot! Idiot! I put you in charge of one thing! One thing! And you screw it up! You're stupid. I like canned corn. I think we should do exactly what they say. No complaining. No rocking the boat. There's six of us and only two of them. Yeah, we could take 'em. No way. Billy's right. So far they don't seem to want to hurt us. I mean, maybe if we don't cause any trouble, they won't cause any trouble. - We'll just play it cool. - Yeah, but what if one of us tries to run away? And where would we go? We've been hiking all day. There's no way one of us could find our way off this mountain. Besides, if one of us tries to split, who knows what they'll do to Sarah. I'm really sorry about this, you guys. I'm really sorry. It's all right, Sarah. We'll be okay. It isn't really your fault. [ Billy ] So we're agreed then, right? All for one and one for all. Best behavior? [ All ] Best behavior. [ Hutch ] Dinner! All right, let's go. [ Owl Hooting ] No, no, no. You sleep over there. I want you to watch these kids. Go on. Get out of here. [ Mouths Words ] Shh. [ Water Trickling ] You guys, we're not out here alone. What? There's someone here who's willing to help us. Someone we all know. What are you talking about, Sarah? Last night after everyone went to sleep, I saw him. He was hiding in the bushes. And he waved to me, to show me that he's here for us. That's great. Who is it? Joey Cooper. Joey Cooper? That wimp? - He couldn't help us if his life depended on it. - We're doomed. He's not a wimp. And he will be able to help us. Besides, he's our only chance. What's he gonna do? How's he gonna rescue us? Or capture Hutch and Baby? I don't know. But I'm pretty sure he's working on something right now. Gotta figure out the next move. [ No Audible Dialogue ] Well, then I guess you're gonna have to try a little harder. I can't hear you, Senator! Now-- No, look-- But-- Just wait a minute. Now, what you're asking me to do, Mr. Flynn-- It's not easy. Your-- Your brother's a convicted felon. These things take time. Yeah? Well, time is one thing your little girl ain't got, Senator. Because with each passing day and each passing hour, I'm starting to care less and less about her well-being. Now, you listen to me, Mr. Flynn. If you let anything happen to my daughter, so help me God, I'll kill you. Well, you better hope I don't get to her first. Daddy, we're in the mountain-- - Anything? - He didn't stay on long enough for us to get a trace. He'll find us. He won't give up. He'll get the whole F.B.I. out here if he has to. Yeah? Well, this mountain range covers 50,000 acres, little girl. Ain't no one gonna find you. Come on. Let's go. Come on, Joey. Where are you? [ Snoring ] Are you okay? Uh-huh. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. We should get you out of here before anyone wakes up. We gotta get you hidden and then get some help. I can't leave. You what? Hutch said if I escape, he'll hurt everyone who's left behind. I have to stay. Then what are we gonna do? [ Snoring ] [ Sarah ] I've been thinking about that. The only way is to trap Hutch and Baby. It's impossible. I've been watching them. Hutch doesn't let you out of his sight, and Baby doesn't make a move without him. Well, that's what I was thinking about. See, it's too hard for you to try to do it all by yourself. You need help. You need the other kids. Huh? Hutch and Baby are watching me the closest, but you might be able to get some of the other kids free. They could help you. I suppose I could try it. Maybe I could even get some of them out. You can't. Why not? Oh. After this afternoon, they decided to take away our shoes every night just to make sure... no one would sneak out while they slept. But they said that they would give them back during the day. Then I'll do it tomorrow. Try to get some of the other kids free, and they can help me. I'll tell them to keep an eye out for you-- to watch for your lead. Well, I better get out of here before Hutch wakes up. I won't let them hurt you, Sarah. I'll find a way to trap Hutch and Baby, and I'll do it before the deadline. I'm counting on you. Hey, Joey? I saved my corn for you. Figured you must be starving. Thanks. [ Baby ] Okay, you guys, here's all the wood. Uh, pick it up. [ Imitates Hooting ] [ Continues Hooting ] Hey, uh, Baby, that's really good. Think you could do it again? Yeah. - [ Amelia ] Do it again. - Sure. You guys think this is good, man, you should see me rope a mean, snortin' bull with the horns. All right! I'm really good. Watch. Check this out. That's cool. [ Baby ] Uh-- - Think you could teach us? - Sure. And then twist it. I'll show you. You got it. What you do is you-- Well, I-I don't think Hutch would like me showing you the trick. [ Moose ] How come? Well, 'cause then I'd have to give you the rope, and I-I don't think Hutch would like that. Aw, Baby. We'll give it back. I don't think so. You know, we really should be going. Let's get the wood and go. Okay? Come on. Chop-chop. Here we go. Come on. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. [ Grunts ] Come on. Let's go. We did good, Hutch. We got lots of wood. Got more firewood than we can use in two whole days. One, two, three, four, five-- One, two, three, four, f-- What'd you do out there, Baby? What do you mean, Hutch? I did just what you told me. I took them to the clearing, and then they gathered the wood, and then we all came back. - Did you do anything else? - Anything else? Like what? Oh, I don't know. Like fool around, get distracted. Nope. Not me. Well, I-I did show them my lasso trick. They really liked that. It was really good. But, no, I didn't get distracted. No, no. What, Hutch? I didn't mess up. I got the firewood just like you told me. - Ow! - [ Laughing ] Ow. What'd you do that for? Idiot. You let one of the kids get away. You stopped paying attention, and you lost a kid! What do you mean, Hutch? They're all here. I counted 'em, you moron! One of 'em is missin'! Oh, man. I'm sorry, Hutch. I-I-I didn't see it. I didn't see nothin'. I didn't mean to lose a kid. Hutch, stop! Please. [ Groans ] Moron! I'm dealing with a moron. And what's worse-- the moron is my brother! What did I do to deserve this? - Cody? - Uh-huh. Joey? Uh-huh. [ Laughing ] So, tell me about this. I wish you were there. [ Humming ] More corn? Yeah, you know, I'm really starting to hate corn. Can a person die of corn overload? Are you complaining? Anyone who complains doesn't get any more corn! - We hate corn! - Yeah. No more corn! [ All ] No more corn! No more corn! No more corn! Shut up! All right. Anyone who complains has to eat two servings. Come on, Hutch. Why don't you at least let us go fishing in the creek? It's what we were planning on doing anyway. All right. You think you can catch something? - Yeah. Please, Hutch? - Catfish. Trout. Come on, Hutch. We want fish. Yeah. No more corn. [ Sighs ] No more corn! No more corn! No more corn! No more corn! No more corn! No more corn! All right! You can fish. But, Sarah, you're staying with me. I'm tying the rest of you together, so no more escapes. Baby, you get some rope. Come on, come on. Let's go. All right? Come on. Let's get it together. Yeah! All right! [ Children Chattering ] Not gonna lose me no more kids. - What do you think? - Well, they're all tied together. Moose is on the end. He'll probably be the easiest one to get. [ Cody ] Good. Sneaking along the edge, we can cut them free and we can lead them back up to here. You know what? Probably only one of us should go. Draw less attention. Yeah. And if one gets caught, the other one will still be free. [ Cody ] Hey, you should start from the waterfall over there. Me? Why me? I thought you'd go. I'm too tall. I mean, they'd see me for sure. Come on, Joey. You can do it. Sarah's depending on you. Sarah. [ Sighs ] [ Amelia ] Oh, shoot. I lost my bait again. And these worms really creep me out. Will you help me? [ Baby ] Sure. You don't have to let them itty-bitty worms creep you out. Act normal. I'm gonna cut one of you loose when he's not looking. Then you're gonna drop down and crawl back with me. What you do is you throw it out there and you be real quiet. And then you wait. Oh. Oh. See? I'm getting a bite. See it? [ Amelia ] Oh. Okay. Just hold, and then you can feel it. Easy. Easy. Just wait for them. Is that a bite? I think so. What kind of bait do you recommend for fish? What do they like the most? Corn. Really? Mm-hmm. But we can't feed 'em any. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Let's go. Look, Hutch. We got fish. Lots of fish. Yeah. One, two, three, four-- One, two, three, four-- - I can't believe this. - What? You lost another kid. I send you to go fishing, and you lose a kid! I didn't see nothin', Hutch. I swear. I didn't see nothin'. A-All we did is fish. I-I-I'm sorry. Ow! [ Whimpers ] You better keep your friends under control, or you're next. [ Sobs ] It's all right, Baby. It's not your fault. Moose? Sure smells good. I'm starving. Me too. Well, this ought to put Hutch in a better mood for sure. Definitely. [ Whispering ] Psst! Sarah. Distract him. That's cool, Hutch. [ Whispering, Indistinct ] I'm gonna get the plates. Yeah, uh, I'm gonna get the forks. How's it coming? Oh, it should be done in a few minutes. [ Mutters, Indistinct ] So, how much older is Hutch than you? Six years. [ Sarah ] Must be great having two brothers. I don't have any brothers or sisters. Yeah, well, Hutch is a little bossy. - Why don't you stand up to him? - Fire! Fire! Get over here! [ Screams ] Baby, get over here! [ Hutch Sputtering ] Ow! Quit hitting me! Hit the fire, you dumb-- [ Sighs ] Oh, no. Oh, no. You kids, you get back here! You get back here right now! I didn't see nothin', Hutch. I didn't see nothin'. -Baby, you pay closer attention! -Please don't hit me! Come on, Hutch! It's not his fault. They'll never get out of here alive. Besides, all I really need is you. Please, Hutch-- I'm ready for dinner. You stupid-- [ Whimpering ] Okay, Hutch. Right away. [ Whimpering Continues ] So, now that we're free, what are we gonna do? Well, they still have Sarah. [ Cody ] We're gonna have to come up with a plan-- either to rescue Sarah or to capture Hutch and Baby. And we have to do it fast. Hutch said if they didn't release his brother... by the day after tomorrow, he'll kill Sarah. Yeah, well, what do you think, Joey? You're the one who started this whole rescue thing. - I don't know yet. - That's great. Nice leadership, Cooper. But I'll think of something. I'm hungry. That fish was smelling pretty good. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. You got anything to eat, Joey? No. We should all just get some sleep. Yeah. The sun will be waking us up soon enough. Yeah. Hey-Hey, Sarah, you wanna play some cards? Yeah. How about Texas Hold 'Em? Yep. I hope your friends don't plan on tryin' nothin'. [ Sarah ] Why does he have to be so mean? I don't know. Do you think your friends will try something? I don't know. Hey, look, you guys. We have to come up with a plan-- Some way to overpower them. Anybody have any ideas? We can pounce on them in their sleep-- use the element of surprise. It's too big a chance someone could get hurt though. Hey, what if we capture Baby, and then we could offer to trade him for Sarah? You saw the way Hutch treats Baby. He'll never go for the trade. And besides, Baby isn't the one we need. We need Hutch. How about if we surround the camp... and make the sounds of Indians on the warpath? They'll think they're about to be ambushed and run. Indians in this day and age? They're dumb, but not that dumb. [ Amelia ] Come on. There has to be something we can do. What about all our training, all our tests? They had to be good for somethin'. [ Joey ] Hold it. I think I have an idea. What is it? What? I definitely have an idea. And I think it just might work. Come with me. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Come on. Let's go this way. Let's do it here. [ Chattering ] Some more rocks, Moose. More leaves, Billy. Tie the rope a little tighter. Make it a little bit more muddier. Ew. Okay, you guys. We're ready. - Does everyone understand their part? - Yep. Yeah. Any questions? Nope. No. Okay, let's do it. Hey, Cooper. Maybe I was wrong about you before. Maybe you're not so useless after all. I mean, what I'm trying to say is, it's a good idea. Thanks, Reese. [ Mutters ] Bye, Joey. Good luck, Joey. See ya. Good luck, dude. [ Chuckles ] Some friends you have. The minute they can, they get up and leave you behind without a thought. That's why I work with my brothers-- loyalty. My friends are loyal, and they're loyal because they choose to be. You force Baby into it with threats. That's not loyalty. That's fear. [ Laughs ] Loyalty. Fear. What's the difference? [ Joey ] There is a difference, Hutch. - And I'm here to prove it. - Joey? Who the hell are you? And what are you doin' here? I'm Coolman, and I'm your downfall. [ Laughs ] I've come for Sarah. Give her up now, and we promise not to tell the police anything. - If I don't? - Then you'll have to face the consequences. You got a lot of nerve for a little kid. [ Laughs ] Baby, you grab her by the neck. If the rest of them kids come, she gets it. And if you screw this one up, Baby, I kill you. Baby! I'm sorry, Sarah. Ready or not, here I come. [ Screams ] [ Screams ] [ Panting ] You are dead meat, Coolman. You don't have to do what he says. Shh. Be quiet, Sarah. We could run-- right now. [ Panting ] I'll tell my dad that you saved my life, and you won't get in any trouble. It'll all be okay. I just can't. Why not? I just can't, Sarah! Even if I got let off by the police, Hutch would kill me. [ Screaming ] [ Panting ] What's the matter, Hutch? Can't you keep up? [ Screams ] - Yes! - [ Grunting ] Yeah! I hate kids. [ Grunts ] [ Screaming ] [ Panting ] I'm gonna get all you brats! Oh, no, you're not. [ Grunting ] Coolman, you're mine. Get ready! [ Grunts ] Come on! He's coming! Go! Ow! Ow! [ Grunts ] Hey! You! Ow! Stop it! Hey, that hurts! Ow! You wait till I catch you! Ow! [ Screams ] [ Grunting ] I'm gonna get you! Ow! Ow! Ow! Come on. Go! Go! [ Hutch Grunting ] [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] - Yeah! We did it! - Yes! - [ Chattering ] - Let me down! This is it, Hutch-- end of the line. Let me down, you brats! Now! - Game over. You lose. - Over, huh? Now you're going to be our prisoner. I don't think so. [ Grunting ] Run! Run! - [ Grunts ] - Go! [ Moose ] Come on, go! He's right behind me! Go, go, go! Pick it up! Come on! Move it! [ Shrieks ] [ Groans ] Come on, hurry it up! Keep going! Keep going! [ All Shouting ] [ Groans ] [ Shouting Continues ] Hurry up! Go! Go! He's right behind us! [ Groans ] I think we lost him. That was one big failure. Hey, we tried the best we could. Well, maybe the fault wasn't in our execution. - It was just a bad idea to begin with. - What's that supposed to mean? Just that your obstacle course sucked. And I was wrong about what I said before. You are completely useless. Man, lay off him, Reese! He did the best he could! And that obviously wasn't good enough. I didn't hear you offering any other ideas. None as lame as yours. Hey-- Hey! Come on, you guys. Let's not fight. We need to stick together. Amelia's right. We do need to stick together. Let's go get some sleep. We can start over in the morning. Okay? I am not a happy man, Senator. I want an answer... now. If Conny isn't released by tomorrow, your little girl gets hurt. [ Senator ] I've got the governor on the line right now, and he's agreed to release your brother. On my terms? [ Senator ] On your terms. He'll be freed at noon tomorrow. [ Laughs ] Y-You're a smart man, Senator. [ Senator ] And then I want my daughter back. Just don't screw it up. You got what you wanted. Now why don't you just let me go? [ Laughs ] Not likely. You're my insurance policy. They try to pull any stunts, I still have you. Are you really gonna let me go when they release your brother? Well, I truly haven't decided that yet. What do you mean, Hutch? Th-Th-That was the deal. When-When Conny's released, Sarah gets to go. Shut up, Baby. [ Footfalls Approaching ] [ Grunts ] You guys, wake up. They're packing up their camp and getting ready to move down the mountain. [ Groaning ] You went over there? Is Sarah okay? She looks okay. What are we gonna do? We have to come up with a new plan. We have to stop trying to use our muscles and start using our brains. What do you mean? Maybe we've been going at this all wrong. Hutch is the bad one, the mean one. - Baby's just scared and bullied. - So how's that help us? Maybe if we could somehow get Hutch away from Baby, then maybe we could talk Baby out of keeping Sarah prisoner. Look. Baby has just been following Hutch's orders. But if Baby is alone, then we could convince him... that he makes the decisions of what to do. Joey's right. Baby's been nice to us all along. All we have to do is convince Baby to take a stand. Well, how are we ever gonna get Hutch to leave Baby alone? Poison oak. Follow me. Here we go again. [ Groans ] Come on. We gotta get movin'. What about all this stuff-- all the trash? Oh, it breaks my heart how some people don't take care of the environment. Come on, Baby. Let's go. Pick up those bags, you idiot! I want to get down the mountain before noon when they're releasing Conny. Come on. Move. Poison oak-- a highly poisonous shrub... with a three-pronged leaf and a red tip. Causes severe rash and itching-- every hiker's nightmare. Careful. Don't get it on you. All right. Good plan. - [ Cody ] Oh, yeah. I can't wait to see this. - It's never gonna work. Yeah. It's never gonna work. Come on. Come on. Here. Here. Quick. Let's do it here. All right. I'll keep a lookout. Faster. They're right behind us. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, go! Quickly, quickly. [ Grunting ] Here we go again. Okay, you guys. Oh, Moose, who's in the lead? Um, first Baby and then Sarah and then Hutch. Hide! [ Joey ] Okay, you guys, I tied it in a bow. So if I give it a good, hard yank, it should come open. Here they come. One, two, three-- Pull! What-- [ Grunts ] What the-- Damn kids! What-What is this? - I don't know. - [ Groans ] Go! Come on! Let's go! Geez! [ Groaning ] [ All Panting ] Okay, everybody across, one at a time! [ Wood Creaking ] You can make it. No time to trip. [ Wood Creaking ] Come on! Hurry, hurry! Baby's alone. Hutch is falling behind. Now's your chance, Joey. Okay, Sarah. You wait here. When I'm safe on the other side, I'll yell to you to come over, okay? Okay. All right. Be careful. Oh, boy. Okay, Sarah. It's okay. Come on across. It's okay. [ Wood Creaking ] It's okay. Stop! - Sarah, stop! - Joey? - What are you doin' here? - Baby, you have to let Sarah go. Baby, grab that kid! - Joey, run! - No. We're not running anymore. Baby, you have to let Sarah go. - You don't want to hurt her. It was all Hutch's doing. - You get him! Baby, Joey's right. We can stop this whole thing right now. I'll tell my father that you saved me, and you won't get in any trouble. I promise. Baby, don't you listen to them. You grab that kid. If you don't grab that kid and let Sarah off the bridge right now, I'm coming over there to get her myself. Hutch, you can't go on to the bridge. You-You'll make it sway, and she'll fall. All right, I'm gonna count to five, and if you don't do what I tell you, I'm coming over there myself. - One. Two! - Hutch, stop! Three! - Hutch! - Four! - Five! - Stay off of that bridge! - Get him! - [ Screams ] - Baby, do something! - Hutch, stop! - Baby, stop him! - Hutch, I mean it! Back off! - Baby, don't you be a fool! You think about what you're doing, Baby. I-If you let her go and you listen to them, they're never gonna let Conny out of prison. Conny broke the law, Hutch. He was wrong! All right, then how about this? If you don't do what I tell you, I'm coming over there to get you. Come on, Baby, think. This is your chance to stand up for yourself. Are you gonna let Hutch bully you forever, or are you gonna be your own man? Back off of her, Hutch. Oh, yeah? And what are you gonna do if I don't? Oh. [ Scoffs ] Yeah. Tough guy. Yeah. Yeah. I thought so. You haven't got the nerve. You're a spineless idiot, Baby. You couldn't tie your own shoes if your life depended upon it. Now, I'm ordering you-- Smack that kid and let me off the bridge with the girl right now! No. [ All ] Yes! - I ain't listening to you no more, Hutch. - Huh? I said, no. I ain't listenin' to you ever again. You're a bad man, Hutch. - I'm falling! - I got you! Let's go! Go, go, go! Hurry up! Shake it. Shake it. [ Moose ] Up and down. [ Shuddering ] - [ Moose ] Come on, come on! - [ Children Shouting ] - [ Shuddering Continues ] Come on! - [ Shouting ] [ Screams ] - [ Amelia Shrieks ] - Yeah! Yeah! Yes! We did it! - Hutch? - [ Children Cheering ] [ Cheering Continues ] [ Chattering ] The phone, Baby. We need the phone. I don't have it. Hutch had it. Oh, no. What do we do now? We're never going to get down before they release the brother. We don't even know the way. Yes, we do. I marked the trail up to this point. What? I could follow my markings, and maybe I can make it... to a phone in time before they release their brother. Let me come, Joey. Please. We could do it together. Okay. The trail is marked with pieces of red T-shirt. You guys make your way down carefully. We're out of here. There's one! Come on. [ Panting ] Come on. Coach! Coach, are you in there? Sarah, the cabin is locked! Coach! Sarah-- Coach! I thought it was locked. It's open. It's empty. Coach? Coach, where are you? [ Coach ] Sarah, Joey, go get help! Upstairs! [ Chuckles ] You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna tear you apart, limb by routed limb. Then I'm gonna feed you to the wolves. And when your father sets my brother free, I'm gonna do the same thing to you. [ Gasps ] You little brat. Ow! You-- Oh! Ow! Hey, Hutch, you're never going to get away with this! You're gonna rot in jail-- just like your brother. Oh, yeah? You little brat. [ Screams ] Hey! Let me out! [ Pounding On Door ] Come on! You have to get help. Yeah. Ah, you ki-- Ah, I hate kids! Let me out! Come on! I got candy! [ Knocks On Door ] [ Sarah ] Mister, mister! Mister! Mister! Hey. What are you kids doing out here all alone? Hey, are you kids okay? Yeah, we're fine. But our coach is locked in a cabin. We have Hutch locked in a closet. We haven't much time. - You're that senator's kid, aren't you? - We need help. We need help. We have to call my dad before noon. I got a radio in the car. Call the rangers. Come on. Mayday, Mayday. Can anyone here me? [ Static ] [ Man On Radio ] Roger your Mayday. What's your location? Over. This is Joey Cooper. I have Sarah Mann with me, and we need to talk to her dad immediately. Okay, Joey. We'll contact the senator. What's your location? Over. No. We need to talk to Sarah's dad. We need to talk to the senator right away. Stay where you are, and we'll get the senator on the line. Over. Go ahead for Senator Mann. [ Sighs ] Daddy, it's Sarah. Stop the release! Don't let the guy go! [ Senator ] Sarah, are you hurt? No, I'm fine. I escaped, and so did all the other kids. Are they there? They're on their way down the mountain now, and we even captured the guy that kidnapped us. Was anyone harmed? No, really, we're fine. I don't know exactly where we are, but I'll put on someone who does. Okay, Sarah. Uh, yeah, uh, Senator, um-- We made it just in time. They're calling the governor to stop the release, and they're sending the police out to get us. Everything's gonna be okay. You did this, Joey. You saved us all. We did it together. No. It was you. You had lots of chances to run away, but you never did. Even when they tried to grab you, you stayed with us. You're our hero. Thanks, Joey. Anytime. Let's go get the other kids. Okay.

We are on location at Northside School, awaiting the arrival... of Sarah Mann, kidnapped this week. [ Children Cheering ] The bus is driving up. The wilderness club. We are waiting for the kids to get out of the van. See if we can get a closer look here. - [ Cheering Continues ] - And here come the kids. They all look very safe and sound. [ Sighs ] Oh, honey, honey. Oh, baby. Oh! God. God, am I so glad to see you two. Oh! [ Cheering Continues ] Daddy! [ Laughs ] Oh! Oh. Mmm. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you sure? Really, I'm okay. Hi, Mom! Joey! Joey! Joey! Are you okay? Mm-hmm. They told me you're the one who saved them all, that you trapped the kidnapper and you talked the other one into letting you all go? Something like that, yeah. Joey, I am so proud of you. Just like Dad used to say, I can do anything I set my mind to. If you would have told me it was gonna be so much fun, I might have tried out for the club too. [ Mother Laughs ] - Daddy-- - Look at you. Daddy, you have to do something. You can't let them send Baby to jail. He didn't do anything to us. And he was the one who let us go free. If he's the one responsible for getting you out of there, believe me, sweetie, I'm gonna make sure that nothing happens to him. The other one, on the other hand, is gonna be sharing... a prison cell with his brother for a very, very long time. [ Sarah Laughs ] I hate kids. Joey, I'm so proud of you. Thank you so much there, buddy. Nice job. I'm, uh-- I'm very grateful to the law enforcement agencies that participated in this, as well as the F.B.I., and I'm just-- Yo, Cooper. You're all right, man. Thanks, Reese. Let's see. - Joey? Joey? - Hmm? This is my dad. Dad, this is Joey Cooper. So this is Joey. I've heard some very nice things about you, young man. I've heard some nice things about you too. [ Chuckles ] Excuse me. Excuse me, Senator. Could I get a picture? What do you say, son? Sure. [ Shutter Clicks ] "Local boy saves six kids, named town hero." See that, Dad? I did it-- Just like you. Well, maybe not exactly like you, but close enough. I can do anything I set my mind to. No stopping me now.
