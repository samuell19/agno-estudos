This is fucking ridiculous! Hey! Jeong-min Lee! I know you're in there! Hey! Jeong-min Lee! You suck! You changed the passcode and you're ghosting me now? Huh? You're not even going to work? We're done. It's over. I'm done with you, for real! I love you, Haneul. How can I make you trust me? Love? Where is this love anyway? Where is it? I can't see it. I can't touch it. Stop tormenting me with your histrionics and just trust me, please! But your actions and your body say otherwise, so why should I trust you? I'm working, you know. And I get tired sometimes. Now you're shaming me for not having a job?! No, that's not it. You're making a big deal out of nothing. All right, then! I am so fucking sorry for being unemployed and freeloading off of you! I'll leave, okay? I'll just leave! Haneul Ji. Watch your mouth! No, let's just put an end to this! I... I don't need a boyfriend who can't even get hard! (08:50 AM) You're so cheap and nasty! So full of yourself just because you own your own house. Forget it, just give me back my shoes, now! And... You promised me that you'd lend me your suit, today... Are you listening in there? I have an interview today! Jeong-min! (Made on the Rooftop) The person you are calling is not available. Please leave a… Damn it… Ari! Is he really not home? Is he at work already? I mean, seriously… Can he be any faster? He changed the passcode in thirty minutes and is ghosting me? I won't forgive him this time, never! (What am I to you? I'm so disappointed in you...) (I'm gonna pack my things and move out.) (I'm seriously disappointed in you…) Ari, Don't tell him that I was here, promise? Ha... He's gonna tell me off for sure... Hey, Go Bong! Are you at home? Man... What the hell happened to your hair? What the hell happened to your shoes? Man, the weather's so nasty! I mean, I'm not his dog looking after his house when he's out, right? He could text me letting me know that he'll be late or at dinner with work! I mean, communication equals love, right? Mmhmm. Of course I can be sympathetic, but why is he tired all the time? I mean, he's taking me for granted! Yes. How can he really like me but lack passion? I'll be honest, if he can't get it up, I get embarrassed, too! It's not that I can't wait to have sex with him! Right... OMG! Bongsik! Here's 50 cents worth of stars! Ta-da! Man, for real... So I need to send you stars to get a reaction out of you! You're not getting a reaction out of me, my ears are bleeding from listening to the same story for the last three years! And you don't even watch my channel anyway, We don't do stars, we do beans! Argh, whatever! I'm really breaking up with him this time! Whatever happened, it was pretty cold of you to tell him off for not getting hard. ...But that actually happened. So, you think it's okay for you to crush his soul? ...Shit! I mean, he's 33 years old and he's still in the closet. He never holds my hand when we're out, He's been saying he'd introduce me to his family since last year and I've yet to even speak to them on the phone! Honestly, wouldn't you have doubts? He shouldn't have made such promises...! That's what you should've told him then. You know what? You're too hot-tempered. Love is nothing! Just enjoy it... And take off those flip-flops. Why? Are you wearing those to the interview? I'm gonna be cool from now on too, you know. You have a long way to go before you can be a cool, handsome guy like me. Fuck, I really don't wanna do this interview. They won't hire me anyway. Should I become a streamer like you? You can make a living out of it, right? Honey, you can't enter the streaming biz with that kind of naive attitude. Man, I have to play badminton today and I can't win in these shoes thanks to you! You're like an old man! Who plays badminton these days? When I play it, even badminton becomes hot. See you! Hot your ass. See you! Fuck you, Jeong-min! I have a suit now... This suit will make me charming in the interview. Suit... Shit! Bongsik Go! You crazy moron! Oh, so close! Do flip-flops annoying you? - Please give me a sec... - You are not going well today. Oh, can we play one more set? No, no thanks. Don't your feet hurt? I'm skilled enough, so I'm fine. Want me to switch shoes with you? I don't wear other people's shoes. I'm clean that way. Oh, right! I've heard that but forgot. You've heard that? I watch your show. Missed Calls Jeong-min (4) My adorable Bongbong, go buy yourself some spicy ddokbokki. Wow, thanks! Bongbong, I want to hear you speak in a manly voice. What the hell... Who the hell asks a man to speak in a manly voice? I'll find you and kill you! My own natural voice is a manly voice. Got that? Of course you should. What's happening? Oh, OMG! Mr. Iron! Mr. Iron! Shut up! You just threw me 20 thousand beans!!! Thank you so much! I love you! (Bongsik, do you have a boyfriend?) Hey, Iron! I told you not to call me Bongsik. I'm letting it slide today cause you gave me 20 thousand beans, got it? And use your head! Do I look like someone who doesn't have a boyfriend? Just look at me! So, stop asking all these nonsense questions, okay? (Do you only have weird clothes, Bongsik?) (Use some common sense, ) (who lends someone a green suit for a job interview?) Yeah, yeah, yeah. That suit was super expensive, you know. I don't want any comments from an ungrateful jerk who doesn't appreciate me. (You have been dismissed from the chatting room) ...What do you want? How was your interview? Why do you even care? Okay... You know what, Haneul? I've been thinking a lot. And? And... I packed your things so you can by and pick it up. ...What? ...I'm sorry for everything. Jeong-min? Hello? I mean... What the... What the... What the fuck... Okay, let's try something new. I'll answer a call from that online troll. Hello- Why the hell are you calling me? Bongsik, I... I got kicked out! Where are you? Oh my word! Who are you? Um... I'm looking for Bongsik... Oh, you mean Ma'dam Bong who lives in the loft? Ma'dam Bong? Are you his boyfriend? Excuse me??? Nice to meet you! Sunja! I told you not to water them whenever you want! You need to give them the right amount of water at the right times! I'm raising these for my business! Gosh, what's all the fuss! I've been raising vegetable gardens for years. I know if they need watering just by looking at them. So just say thank you, Ma'dam Bong, if you appreciate me. Argh! I told you not to call me Ma'dam Bong! Ugh! Then don't call me Sunja, either! Just call me big sister... What the… Just leave your bag in the dressing room and wash your hands and feet first! Okay. Hey, are those all authentic? They're knock offs, right? Ugh, you're so gross! Use a towel! You're so OCD... Ugh. Are you crazy? Who spends that much money on socks? Are you insane? They're not socks for commoners, you know. Man... If I made that much money from streaming, I'd buy a house. Who the hell has a designer brand shop inside a shabby loft? You're such a boomer. You don't know how society operates because you don't have any money, jerk. You think you can buy a house whenever you have enough money? We can never buy our homes anyway, not in our lifetime. That's why... I'm gonna die before I turn 40. They're sold out!! Dammit! ...Let's just drink. I can totally tell that you're a jobless jerk. Who the hell starts drinking in the middle of the day? Cheers! Gosh! What a great view. Welcome to my rooftop! You're so full of shit! You're only renting this place. Admit it, calling this shabby loft a rooftop won't turn this poor neighborhood into Amsterdam! Sunja! Just quietly go about drying your peppers and leave us alone! I'm only letting you up here because you made us kimchi pancakes. What the, did you use my peppers in these pancakes? Yeah. You're enjoying the pancakes, right? So who cares whose peppers I used. I told you not to touch my things! Gosh, Ma'dam Bong... Didn't realize your thing was so sensitive! What? Sensitive? Am I being sexually harassed? You are super close with your neighbor, huh? She's a tenant on the second floor and she's super nosey! She collects electricity and water fees even though she's not the landlady and she just bursts in here and gives out these things. She says she has a son in the military who looks just like me but does that even make sense? How can someone who looks like that have a son as handsome as this? Anyway, she's being all nosey but she's not a bad person. Wow, she really cooks well! Your palate must've changed from the break up, eh? I can hear you, Ma'dam Bong! I mean, Bongsik! Stop calling me Ma'dam Bong or Bongsik! Shit! I'm gonna change my name for real! Really? To what? ...How's Bok? Bok Choi. So, you wanna be a comedian now? I mean, doesn't it remind you of Hong Kong movie stars, like Jacky Chan or Leslie Cheung? Well, it makes me think of... Mala soup. Why don't you name yourself MLS? That's kinda cool. Oh my god! Your name's Haneul! It means sky! You know people's lives are determined by their names! I wanna live a great, glorious life! My first name means sky but combined with my last name it sounds like basement. Ji, Haneul! So, does it stand for the sky or the basement? My life is so obscure, just like my name. That's because you're not putting your soul into your job search. Admit it, you don't have the motivation. I do, but… There's nothing I really wanna do and there's nothing I'm good at and I feel like a pathetic loser whenever I write my cover letter! Argh! Forget it! You don't have to pay rent this month… By the way, what did Jeong-min say? Dunno... That jerk's out of my life. You and your temper. You sure you didn't throw it away? It's definitely in there. Look for it in there. Sorry. I must've misplaced it. When I find it, I'll give it back to you. Forget it. It's just a book. I can buy a new one. Don't skip your meals. Thanks, you too... Is that a new shirt? Huh? Oh, this. Someone bought it for me. So you're good. You already have someone buying you clothes. How nice. What do you care? It's none of your business. No, it's not. Well, take care then. Oh, right! I've been thinking and I think it'll be for the best if Ari comes with me. She's spent more time with me than you anyway. - Is that okay? - What? Even so, that makes no sense, Ari's my cat. That's nonsense! No one possesses Ari! And technically speaking, we got her because I wanted to adopt a cat! If no one can possess her, she's not yours either! And Ari's mine! I paid for her with my money! You can't take her so don't even dream about it! Why're you yelling? You're scaring her! You're such a disappointment! Because you paid for her? Is Ari just an object to you? Huh? I can't believe I spent three years with someone like you… What? What did you just say? Whatever, just leave! Leave now! And this is MY house, I'll take care of Ari! I won't just let her go! That's what happened. That bitch. It's really over this time. Oh really now? We'll see how long it lasts. You're so inconsiderate! Your friend just broke up with his lover! You'll get it once you get to know him, Sunja. He's cried and wailed and made a big fuss like three times now? No, 4 times including this one. Well, that's how love goes, you know. And a real friend would cry and wail with him, don't you think? Of course, of course. How many times have you broken up with this guy? It's the first time I've moved out. Oh! Sunja! Something's burning downstairs. I smell it. Hurry, hurry! By the way, should I tell the landlord? That you two are living together? God! Stop being so nosey! Here. What's up with the tomatoes? I'm gonna sell them. Rooftop Harvest Organic Vegetables! Come here. Why? What do you mean why? Now we play. Watch and learn. Smile! (Bongbong & Haneul, official rooftop roommates! We're both single now T^T) Hey, I'm not yet... (Are you finally starting your own business?) See? You're full of shit! (Haneul will gonna a big shot on his business!) You said you're breaking up for real this time! (Wow! Haneul. He is very creative.) But still... (Wow! Haneul. He is very creative.) Just forget it! Okay... Great game today. Thanks. How strange. Excuse me? Why do you avoid making eye contact with me? Huh! I don't ever avoid making eye contact... Why do you come here when you don't even like the game? I- I love playing! Who comes to play dressed like that? ...That's my personal business. And you're nosey as hell. I'm not a nosey person at all. Cause you're the only person I talk to, don't I? ...Why don't you sit up here? If I do, then you won't look at me. ...I know what you're trying to do here but. I'm not interested in dating. Weren't you trying to get people's attention when you posted that on your profile? Ha, are you my stalker? No. I'm interested in Bongsik, not Bongbong. So, will you please have a drink with me? And please stop glaring at me. When have I ever glared at you? I work here. I'll whip up something tasty for you when you come. Please come! (The address of the Gay bar VIVA) Well, now I get why you play badminton every weekend! I just visit because he was hitting on me so much. Maybe you're barking up the wrong tree here. Hey, I'm Bongbong! Bongbong my ass. (Jeong-min) Wait for me, Go Bong! Hurry! You're gonna fall down! Wow. It's really nice! Hey! You came! Yeah. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. This is a nice place. The first round's on me. What would you like? - What do you want? - I... I want se-se... Two Sex on the Beach, please. Okay, just give me a moment. - Ur... uhmm... - Stop it! Hey, Bongstar! What!? What are you doing here? I came here to feel the rhythm! This is my boyfriend. - Nice to meet you. - OMG! I'm your biggest fan! - Oh my, - this is so... awesome! - So, you're a Bongster! - He's the biggest Bongster. Hey Bongstar, your hair rocks! Oh this thing? I don't care for it that much though. Honey, can I take a picture with him? Later, honey, later. You know, Hyung-jun right? - Of course I know him. - He's here too. - Really? - Yeah, let's go and say hi. Let's go, let's go! No wait, let's just take one picture here. Take it over there. I'll take a hundred pictures for you. I just want 20 pictures. I'm gonna hang out with them for a bit, so have yours first. Hey... where're you going? Enjoy... Bongsik! Here! Bong Bongbong-Boro Bong- Tada-! Hey!!! Now take my picture! Now! Okay, picture time! Thank you. Uhm... Is Bongsik always like that? Excuse me? Is he always so defensive? Oh... well... He's quite innocent unlike how he looks like... Has Bongsik mentioned me at all? Minho! Excuse me for a second. (Do you like cats?) (Yes. But how long have you had that cat?) (Oh... I just adopted her today:)) No way... Did he sell her? (From where?) (Umm.. From an app for abandoned pets.) No... He abandoned her? No way! There's no way. (Can you show me more pictures of her?) (She's just so adorable!) (Do you want to meet up and see her for yourself?) Haneul. ...What the...? Well... You're ignoring my calls so... So, you're stalking me? No I'm not! Actually... I'm Bat. I just missed you so much. So you're using Ari to catfish now? You are beyond pathetic. Haneul, wait! Please, just talk to me, please? ...Are you drunk? Please, Haneul... What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? Get up! Haneul, I'm so sorry... I'm really, so sorry... But how could you just come here! So careless! What if I were a terrible, dangerous person... ...Oh my god, why all of a sudden. Okay, so what did you do wrong? Do you even know? Just tell me. Ah? That's... I am really sorry... But actually... No. I'm just so sorry about everything. So you don't even know what you did wrong, still? Haneul, I just wanna get back together again... This is why we can't get back together! Crying doesn't mean anything! You're not sincere about anything! ...Haneul, huh? Call me when you realize what you did wrong. All right? Hey! Your ass is literally on fire! It's his third call. I'll pick up on the fifth one. I'll party 'til then. - Bongsik. - Why? He stopped after his fourth attempt? He's gonna call me anytime now. Well he's not... That's weird... Well, he will and you'll be back home tonight, which means you don't have much time left to enjoy being single so let's just enjoy it for now! No, wait, just wait for a sec... Hello? Jeong-min? Isn't this Jeong-min Lee's phone? Hello? Who is this? I mean who are… What?? Jeong-min Lee... I heard Jeong-min Lee is here! He was in a car accident. Oh, are you a family member? Family... Yes, I'm his family. You're his brother, right? I got Mr. Jeong-min Lee's family here! It's his brother. We couldn't unlock his phone since we don't know his password. We need his parents here, right now! Here's Mr. Lee's phone. Please call your parents ASAP. (WRONG PATTERN) (WRONG PASSWORD) Jeong-min Lee! Jeong-min! His surgery is finished just now, but he was unconscious... It'll be okay. Jeong-Min Lee’s brother… Wait, please wait! Your parents have just arrived. This way please. We're out of spoons now. Use this. It was my birthday... His password was my birthday... and his wallpaper was still a picture of me… Okay, okay. Easy, easy... So what did you do with his phone? I deleted all my pictures and gave it back to the nurse. Stop crying now! You're already pretty ugly! Jeez... I- thought about-introducing myself- But how could I when he didn't tell them about me, despite my constant nagging, so how could I how could I introduce myself to them... That's true. You did the right thing. You shouldn't be the one to tell them. Stay home today. I'll go out and buy some soup. Hey, weather! You really suck! I mean, you should think about people's feelings! What the...? (Why did you leave so suddenly yesterday?) (Did something happen?) (Something happened to my friend.) (Can you come back? I have something to say.) What did you have to tell me? Didn't you have something to say? Well, I'll be leaving if you don't have anything to say. Good work today. See you tomorrow. So, what do you have to tell me? If you wanna smoke, you can. I don't smoke, but you can if you want to. I'm a non-smoker, too. I work out! But you never do. Oh, you really look like a person who would smoke though. I thought you'd smoke. You know... your personality doesn't go with your look. Well, I got that smoker's look from my parents. That's not what I'm talking about. You pretend to be cynical and all... but you're actually like a little boy. Why're you so forward? Cause you don't hate it. ...I hope you're not asking me to go to bible study with you... What're you saying? Or are you gonna ask me to join a cult? Oh, stop it. Will you go out with me or not? I'll give you 5 seconds to answer. What? 5, 4, 3, 2, I- I will! Okay, I will. Wow! Yay!! He will! Wow, I'm so excited!! My... He's so weird... What the fuck! What the hell? Why're you sleeping here? How long has it been...? Hmm? How many days have passed since? ...3 days. It's Saturday. 3 days... Excuse me... Where's the funeral hall? I'm not sure either... Ari! Ari! Meow-meow-Ari! Ari? Ari, are you okay, Ari? ...Who... are you? You went to school together? My name is Go Bongsik. Jeong-min and I were really close... He was a few years ahead of me in college and we were in the same theater group. Oh, you were close. A reunion! I heard what happened to him in the group chat... and I was so worried... so I came by... Oh... Is he awake? Jeong-min...? ...The surgery went fine, but he's still unconscious, so we're just waiting. Hmm, uhmm! Then... You came here knowing that my brother isn't home? ...Oh, yes, because she's starving! - The cat! She's starving! - Excuse me? - Ari? Ari? - Star... starving... excuse me but who is...? Didn't you see a Siamese cat this big when you came in... Don't you know what a Siamese cat is? Siam... Siames... What's a Siamese? Ari? - She doesn't eat well when she's alone. - Oh, okay... Okay. She must be hiding 'cause she saw a stranger... Ari... I haven't seen her yet… - But I'll check under the bed. - Ari! Ari! Why... Why? Did you find something? What? She must've gotten out! Why did you keep the window open? I'm ready! Let's go! Why aren't you selling the bok choy? Well... I'll tell you why later. By the way, you're talking to me so comfortably all of a sudden. I thought you were just acting, but looks like you really do like spicy food. Don't eat too much. It'll hurt your stomach. Don't worry. I'll die before I turn 40 anyway. Huh? What are you talking about? I spend my money as soon as I earn it, so I can't maintain a long life. Wait. Now you're fine. Ari. Air! Ari Ari Ari-! Where... are you? Ari-! Let me drive the scooter. Careful man. You cannot drive it easily. Slow down! You're gonna fall! See? I told you you're gonna fall! I will teach you how to drive well. Hold the handle. Can you ride a scooter by yourself well? Yeah, I can do it well. - You wanna sit? - Yeah. Oh, wait a sec. What's that? Sanitizer. You don't have to do that. I know, but it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I didn't wash my hands. I'm kidding! Don't lie! I really washed them! I just wanted to tease you. You're such a troll. Hey, we're only 8 months apart, we're the same age. “We'uh onwy 8 months apaht.” We're the same age! Friends of the same age! So, as a friend of the same age, can I ask you a question? What do you wanna ask? Why did you play so hard to get? Well, okay then. I'll ask you another question. The bok choy. Why aren't you selling them? Are they more precious than the others? Oh, that... Well, I'm just experimenting with them. What do you think? Is it too cheesy to use as my stage name? Bok choy. Park Choi. Choi Park. Super cheesy. Reminds me of mala soup. Freakin' mala soup…damn it! But it's way better than Bongsik Go. I wanna have a pretty name, like Cheongha, the sexy idol. But you're much prettier than Cheongha. Seriously! Will you stop with the flirting? I'm leaving the bok choy to bloom. Does bok choy grow flowers too? Well, I don't know but people say vegetables bloom too. So I got really curious whether they really bloom or not. Whether they're pretty or not. What color will this bok choy be, raised on soil from the dollar shop and fine dust from China in a loft? It's not a loft, it's a rooftop. You're not going to run away anymore, right? Today's Day 1 for us, right? Hmm? There's something I haven't told you. What is it? I need to tell you something if we're going to be together. What is it? Tell me. I want to know. I'm... HIV positive. It's okay, it's okay. I appreciate your honesty. It's cold. Let's go back now. Ari... Ari. Ari, Ari!! Seriously though, is it really necessary to search this hard for someone else's cat? What do you mean someone else's. I mean... It's your brother's. Whatever. I've never seen her. I've just heard about her a few times. And he's MY brother, not yours. And why're you being so desperate about all this? She's a tiny little thing and imagine how scared she is in some strange place! She must be starving, too. You can just sit anywhere, can't you? I'm so hungry. I'm hungry, too. Let's grab a bite and then continue looking for her, okay? I need to go back to the hospital. I just came back to get some things. What about Jeong-min...? He'll be fine, right? (English Tutor) Oh! That! Look at that! A flyer! We should make one too! I mean, a flyer for a lost cat! Well, I don't think the design matters here but... Excuse me? But do you think that font's appropriate? (Lost Cat) Oh... Okay... (Name: Ari/ Age: 3/ Female/ Siamese Specialty: Curious and Adorable) Her ears, tails, and legs are darker than her torso. (She's gentle but afraid of strangers so please do not try to catch her when you find her.) (If seen, please call this number. REWARD!!! 010-xxxx-xxxx) I'll print 50 of this and then go. Thank you so much. Do you want some ramen or something? You worked really hard. Really? I really appreciate it! You hardly refuse offers, do you? Is Jin Ramen Mild okay with you? Oh! JRM isn't a common flavor! Enjoying JRM means that person is a sophisticated gourmet. - It looks so delicious! - Help yourself. You must be really close to my brother. Well, just the right amount. I thought he didn't have any friends 'cause he's so mean. Isn't he... kinda childish? Yes, yes! He's so stingy about every little thing! He's always saying, Well, this is mine! That one's yours! And he's such a fuddy-duddy! Always nagging me as if he's my guardian! I mean, who is he to tell me to follow my dreams? Who does he think he is? Tell me about it. And he's the one who makes his own life difficult, always blaming me and our parents for it! If he had had any problems, he should've just told me... so that... I can only help him... if he tells me stuff. I mean, I can only help him... if he tells me stuff. I... just don't know what's on his mind... and but he didn’t' tell me anything. He never tells me anything! Stop crying! The doctor told us he's not braindead. He said we should wait and see... It's my fault... It's all my fault, really. I just nagged him to show me... 'cause I couldn't trust him... What did you ask him to show you...? Oh, that's... I can't tell you that, I'm so sorry...!!! Then you shouldn't have started talking...! Why did you just stop halfway? Now I'm curious!!! I'm really sorry! You should tell me what you're sorry for! Otherwise, I'm not sure whether you should apologize to me or not! Ari. Ari! Where have you been? Were you outside? Where have you been? What the... Ahh! You almost gave me a heart attack! What're you doing here? Shhh-Ma'dam Bong's sleeping. Ma'am, Bongsik said he'll tell the landlord if you keep coming up here. Then should I tell the landlord that you're living here with Ma'dam Bong? No, you misunderstood me terribly, Ma'am. Just find a job and pay your share of the rent. I don't think he's cut out for the streaming business anymore. Just look at his state. What state? I'm always pretty and sparkling. I'll die when I turn 30 so I can die pretty. You said you'll die when you turn 40! Why has it been shortened to 30? Oh, don't worry. People who say stuff like that are popping supplements when no one's looking. (Minho) Let's make some mala soup with the bok choy. You can't make mala soup without bok choy. You idiots! Sunja! That's a bit much! I thought you two would have better manners than other guys! You morons! Get your shit together! She's coming this way! The person you are calling is not available. Please leave a message at the tone. (Sorry, I've been busy.) Minho, aren't you gonna play?

(minho_singing: Maybe he's not pretending to be nice, you're just misunderstanding him.) Everyone thinks like that, they do, but... I can tell from his eyes. What he is actually thinking. Just piss off. (minho_singing is dismissed.) (Username is convert to mino_saying) (mihno_saying accesses to a chat room) The backstabber never knows! Only the one who gets backstabbed knows! I'm just that valuable to him. This is an unchanging rule. (mihno_saying: You should tell him that then.) (mihno_saying: Dumping a person who doesn't have any clue is also bad.) Whoooo... Thanks for the expensive gift! What I mean is that, the person who doesn't have any clue won't get it when I tell him. OMG, Penglovu! Thanks for the great gift! Thank you! (mihno_saying: You're such a coward.) Okay, that's it for today. Wait, Bongsters, I really have to take a shit right now. (minho_saying left the chat room.) You get that, right? I need to go shit now. Bye! Wasn't it him? The badminton guy? Yeah. So, you're just gonna ignore him like that? Yeah. I’m not the one to be telling you this, but why are you being like this? He's making such an effort. He sent me $30 worth of beans. Man, I want something spicy! You want some ddokbokki? I have to be somewhere. Stop dumping capsaicin into your body! You'll regret it someday... And regretting something is really, really hard. Fucking hard. $45 Bongsik! Bongsik! Mental illness is slowly setting in. I definitely have to die before turning 30. ...It really bloomed. I didn't even water them! How come? Sunja! It bloomed! Look at these flowers! Spicy ddokbokki is here. Oh, spicy ddokbokki. Will you please wait for a sec? Wait, I haven't ordered anything yet. I know it'll hurt your stomach, but you want to die young, so let's eat and die together. I…I didn't order this. I ordered it in my mind?! How did you know?! Well, I know what you like. It's too easy. By the way, a person who brings your favorite food without you ever asking is kind of a good guy, don't you think? ...Is the first floor door open? Oh, a middle-aged woman opened it for me. I actually begged her, saying that I really wanted to see you. ...Sunja, that woman! Please go. I'm busy. Stop saying such nonsense and say Ah! I did something wrong that day, didn't I? No, you didn't. I'm sorry. There's nothing for you to feel bad about. The way I reacted that day... must not have been what you expected. But that's the kind of person I am. I'm a thinker. I don't think everybody's the same. I'm the kind of a person who has to spend enough time to think, so I did. And I finished thinking so now I'm here today. Finished thinking about what? I want to be with Bongsik Go for a long time. Whatever happens. You don't have to do that. I said stop saying nonsense. Are you crying? I'm not! Who do you think I am? I'm the Bongstar! You can cry out loud if you want. It's okay. Everything's fine. Ari! How have you been? Hey, Ari. You missed me didn't you? Ari! Are you coming in through that? Do you want to take her? Excuse me? She won't eat when I'm around anyway. You said that she gets tense when she's around strangers. She only eats when you're around, Haneul. That's true... What did you just call me? You're Haneul, not Bongsik. No! I am Bongsik Go. I thought so. Our family rarely gathers, and every time we'd meet up he'd just talk about his girlfriend. I mean as if we cared. He would say things like she's too emotional, sits anywhere she can, (I'm lending you this book, ) eats ramen every day, (but I really want to buy you a copy! Enjoy!) eats ramen every day, (You don't have to give it back to me) especially JRM which tastes awful… (because we'll never break up. Lol.) especially JRM which tastes awful… (I love you. -Haneul-) she always misspells things and all those stupid things. They kinda hit me that day. He told me he couldn't find it. He hid it like it was a jewelry box. (If I return this, it will feel like we're really over.) (I'm so sorry that I can only love you in such an invisible way.) (I really miss you. -Jeong-min-) So, Jeong-min only said such garbage about me? He told us great things about you too. He was presenting you so nicely to our parents. Saying that you're so nice and innocent. And then, what did he say? Oh, that you'll be loved everywhere you go. No... He'd been saying that he'll introduce his girlfriend since last year, but we've yet to even speak to her over the phone. We all know about you. We just didn't know that you were a man. And I wondered what kind of a person you'd be. Anyway, take the cat and take these with you. Thank you... but please... Please don't tell your parents. Because Jeong-min should make that decision himself. I'm not willing to do that for him. He'll take care of it. It's his business. Sorry, Ari. Please hang in there for a bit. Let's go up to the rooftop! You crazy jerk! How am I supposed to keep a cat? You see all this? All this hair and poop! And when she shits, it'll smell... No! Please Bongsik! I will take care of everything! I'll clean the whole house! Promise! And I'll give you $100 plus my part of the rent! Well, not $100, maybe $50… Dammit! You don't even have money! I'll earn it! I'll fucking earn it from today! So, please Bongsik! Just this once... What the. Why? She is on my belly. Rarely enough, but it seems that she likes you. She knows well who is the boss. You're such a good eater. Ari, you should be quiet, okay? I didn't tell the landlord that you're living with me yet. Dammit! How can I hide the fact that I'm raising a cat? I already told the landlord. What? Dammit! I knew you'd be trouble some day, Sunja! I'm going to get evicted. Ma'am, I really don't have anywhere else to go in Seoul!!! They said it's okay. Okay my ass! They're just saying that! You don't know what these landlords are like! It's me. What? I'm the landlord. You can have her here. I'm the cat mom of this neighborhood! My god, Sunja... I really... have had so much respect for you this entire time. Me, me too... No, not you. You are pretty, but you need to do more than just talk. If you succeed in finding a job, I'll buy you anything. Sister, I shall go forth and make some money! Be safe out there, okay? You're not joking around, right Sunja? The streaming thing, I want our Ari on it instead of Ma'dam Bong. Why on earth didn't you tell me that you were the landlord 'til now? Yummy, it's so yummy... Hello. Delivery service! Thank you! Thank you! Apartment 301, right? - Yes, thanks. - Thank you! (Auction site) What are you doing? Building up my savings to prepare for my old age. Savings? (Good for your health! Do not skip!) Yes, I am. Who? Oh, okay... Okay. Yes, I can. Next week? Okay, I got it. See you next week then. Bye. Who was that? You were talking like a real adult there. A representative from a creative company or something. Did they offer you a contract? Well, they just want to meet me. Wow... You have plans now, don't you? Oh, right! How did your interview go? It was outstanding! I was the only one there! I was the only one there... who spoke English so terribly! But still, it was way better than when I was wearing that Joker get up. Oh right! I should sell that one too. You wrinkled it that day! Sorry. Why did you think Jeong-min did that then? Did what? I mean, he told me that he bought Ari so she's his... being all cheap and stingy. Because I went back for Ari. Three times. Ugh! Why're you touching my hair? So, she never called you after that? His sister, that is. She said she'll call me when something's up. Ari... Bong Go, somehow you've been in your relationship for over 2 months now. My god, I feel so bashful! Stop saying that- But it's already been 2 months now? I didn't even realize that it's been more than 2 months! Excuse me, sir. Please lower your spirits a bit! Hey, are you playing badminton? Let's all go together. You, me, Minho, and Jeong-min. You know how awesome badminton is? It's the perfect sport that develops your whole body and helps you build muscles in the most beautiful way. What're you doing? Specifically when you smash, huh? When you smash! Look at my veins here! And my tendon! - You know! Smash! And then smash back! - Sir, it was all my bad...! Please stop. It's really sexy when you get all sweaty and all. - So let's go together and practice. - Just leave me alone! I don't wanna play badminton. Jeong-yeon(Jeon-min's sister) Hello...
