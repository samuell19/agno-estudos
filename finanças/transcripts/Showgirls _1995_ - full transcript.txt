Doing some of the finest cocaine in the world, darlin'. You want some? It's great for the muscles. I told Marty I'd work on your turns with you, darlin', but I'm feelin' a little turned inside out myself today. Cut the shit. - Ok. We got off on the wrong foot. You wanna start dancin' all over again? Why? - Why not? Do you wanna walk down to spago? Where is it? Just down from ver-sayce. Versace. Ah, right. Versace. - Yeah. Right this way. Enjoy. I don't know what all this stuff is. I'll order for you. Don't they have brown rice and vegetables? Do you like brown rice and vegetables? Yeah. You do? - Sort of. Really? It's worse than dog food. It is. I've had dog food. You have? - Hm. A long time ago. Doggy chow. I used to love doggy chow. I used to love doggy chow, too. I get a headache from champagne. Oh, this isn't champagne. This is holy water. I named myself after this holy water. Chrissie Lou Connors used to have dingy brown hair and little bitty tits. It's amazing what paint and a surgeon can do. You have great tits. They're really beautiful. Thank you. I like nice tits. I always have. How 'bout you? I like having nice tits. How do you like havin' 'em? What do you mean? You know what I mean. I like having them in a nice dress or a tight top. Hm... You like to show 'em off. I didn't like showing 'em off at the cheetah. Why not? I liked looking at 'em there. Everybody liked lookin' at 'em there. It made me feel like a hooker. You are a whore, darlin'. No, I'm not! We all are. We take the cash, we cash the check, we show them what they want to see. Maybe you are a whore, cristal, but I'm not. You and me, we're exactly alike. I'll never be like you. Miss Connors! Sorry to bother you, but would you, uh, sign this for me? I'd be happy to. What's your name? Frank. I'm from galveston. Well, I'm just a little ol' farm girl from del rio myself, frank. I told you she was from Texas. Whoo-ee, look at that! Could I have me one just like that? What, you want a girl to use up all her lipstick on you? You want to dance? Right now? It's now or never. That's what Elvis said. Oh, you know, the best advice I ever got? You're up there onstage, hopin' on a spot. If someone gets in your way, step on 'em. If you're the only one left standin' there, they hire you. That's about it. Thank you and good night, ladies and gentlemen. Elvis has left the building. You see, darlin', you are a whore. Bitch! Guess we're done. Right here. Right here. Thank you. Thank you. Nicky. Can I talk to you for a second? Listen, we're doin" a show and... Look out. Coming through. Mommy, can we see the monkeys? Not now, honey, they're busy. Please, mommy, they're so cute! They have to work, sweetheart. What are they doing, mommy? They're getting ready for the show. Why can't we see the monkeys? Get these fucking kids outta here! She said the "f" word! She said the "f" word! Shut the fuck up! It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. Come on, honey. Let's get out of here. Nomi. Listen, there's a boat convention comin' into town next week. We need 2 girls. Nicky's gonna do it. You interested? It pays 1,000 dollars. 1,000 dollars? - Yeah. To do what? Just represent your hotel for a day. You wear your costumes and your smile, and they take your picture. 1,000 dollars? - Hm. Yeah. - Great. Thanks. Cristal here recommended you. Thanks. - My pleasure, darlin'. Just lookin' out for you. We must talk about that magazine layout. Later! - Don'tdo it. What? It's 1,000 dollars. Why not? Molly, I need you! Yes, I know some girls who've done it... I'm waiting! They didn't like it. Did you do it? - Yeah. Did you like it? Did I like it? Sure, I liked it. Let's hear it for these 2 beautiful girls from "goddess", the new smash at the stardust. Thank you. Hey! Hey, guys! How's it goin'? Fine. Tough gig, huh? - Very tough. This is my good friend, mister okida. He's from Bangkok. He's one of our very, very high rollers. Ladies, we got a great idea. We want to take you to dinner tonight after the show. Have some lobster, hear Caesar sing. You ever heard Caesar? Caesar sing? Caesar'll sing, and then we'll go back to my place, and we'll sing. Just the 4 of us. How 'bout it? We sing. Yeah, we'll sing a lot of songs. Yeah? Ok. - Ok. Good deal. Ok. Good deal. Not me. - Whoa. Excuse me. Hey! Hey, hey! Be nice. Get your hands off me! You're getting 1,000 dollars for this. Yeah, for this! This! Ok, forget it. Just forget it! No harm done! No damage! Christ! Zack? - Yeah? I want to talk to you. - Sure. Let's go upstairs. Did you have a nice day, darlin'? No. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry. Some people just don't get it. Yeah, I'm on the stage. Get me Phil newkirk, would you? All right. Thank you. - I want you to stay. Yeah. Well, the drop is up 33 % on those 58 machines. It's gonna make you a bottom line about 2-50. Right. Ok. I got an m.B.A. For this. That's what this business has come to. Cost analyzing every slot machine. What's an m.B.A.? Zack, you in here? Yeah! Excuse me. Hey, hey, hey! What's goin' on? If I ever hear anything like this again, you're outta here. Zack, nothing happened. Yeah, somethin' happened! She's jumpin' to conclusions. And if it happens again to anybody, you're gonna jump to your conclusion. Without your golden parachute. You owe her an apology. Nomi, I'm sorry. I apologize. Yeah, fine. Ok. Get outta here. - Yeah. Give 'er some juice on 3 and 4, now! An m.B.A. Is a degree you pick up... In college. It's mostly worthless in the real world. You go for it, don't you? Yeah, I try to. Showtime. - That's for sure. Blake, bring both of those back up! Phil, you dumb fuck, get back up here, would ya? I know, I know. I want to thank you for looking out for me. It was so nice of you... To recommend me to Phil. What are friends for? Right. Molly. You were right about the convention. Oof, sweet baby! Hm! Oh! Do that again, sal, I'll break your fucking fingers! Hey, I can't help it if you don't have a gay partner. He's so hetero and wants everybody to see how hetero he is. Can you bring that flashlight over here? You want a knuckle sandwich, huh? Oh, can I have mine anally, please? Come on, you guys, stop! Jesus! Let's line it up! What are you lookin' at, bitch? Let's move it! Come on, go, go, go! Oh my god. Oh my god. Are you ok, Annie? Let me take a look. Can you move your leg? No, it's not here. It's my leg or something. Tell me when you feel something. It's her knee. It isn't broken, is it? Daryl? What happened? My foot went out from under me. Hey, gay! This is what happened. I wonder how those got up there. They probably came off a costume. We're gonna take you to the hospital. Shit, no! Fuck! Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break. Let us through here, please. See ya. - I'm the producer. I hired your show! You're my producer! You'll do what I say. Hey! She was my understudy. I want a voice in this. Guess who's gonna make the decision. It is broken, kids. Shit. That'll be 3 months. At least. Bad Karma, huh? Nomi, your mother's waiting for you. My mother? Well, for your sake, I hope she's not. If a light sleeper can sleep with a light on, can a hard sleeper sleep with a hard on? What do you call a tiger? A tiger's a big pussy that eats people. Henry! - Oh! I can get shit on, but I don't like getting' spit on. Ha-ha! Hi. - Hi, al. You look like shit. She looks better than a ten-inch dick, and you know it. So, you like it here? What do you think, she's gonna miss you? Yeah, why not? We miss her. She misses us like that lump on my twat I had taken off last week. We saw the show. You were good. Thank you, al. Real good. You take care, kid. Must be weird not having anybody come on you. Nomi! Hey, you want a ride? I got one. - Ok. Good night. Wait! You ever been in one of these? No. I always wanted one. Oh! It's some car, isn't it? It doesn't suck. All right, where are we headed? You have to give me directions. To your place. Do you like cristal? I like a lot of different champagnes. But I always stick with champagne. Oh! What's Andrew carver like? Are you nervous? Don't be. - I'm not. I liked it when you came. I liked your eyes. Hey! Stay with me, huh? I'll drive you back in the morning. It is morning. - Please? I've got a taxi coming. Send it back. Cristal needs a new understudy. There's an audition at noon. You want to try? Would you have told me about it if I hadn't come here? It wasn't my idea to come here. It was yours. I want to see you again. We'll see how it goes. What, the audition? Thanks. - Thank you. Oh, hello! Oh, I hate you. Hm. Who was he? Zack. - Oh my god. Did you tie him up? - Oh shit. What? - I forgot to untie him. Are you high? - Maybe a little. Oh, I can't go to sleep now. I've got an audition at noon. Where are the sugar-snaps? In the cupboard. Nomi, don't get sucked into it. Uhoh, look what I found! Ok, whatever, nomes. Julie. She's not hot enough, tone. She's got it down. You can't teach 'em to get it down. She doesn't have cristal's heat. Well, none of 'em have cristal's heat. I do love you, gay. Nomi's got heat. Does she now? - Yes, she does. Oh, in a totally different way, of course. Come on! She's gonna take the lead? This is a hotel show! This isn't the cheetah. Nobody's gonna take my lead anyway. I haven't missed a show in 8 years. But you're not gettin' any younger. Eat me. You wanna do it again with just nomi? No. Yeah, I do. Set it up, Marty. This is bullshit. It's about your dick. Nicky, Julie, thank you! What do we know about her? Nothin'. I'm not even sure she gave us the right social security number. Find out, would you? Right. You fucked her, didn't you? Does that piss you off because you're jealous, cris? Or because I beat you to the punch? You fuck him for the spot or you fuck him because you wanted to? I say you did it for the spot. Is that what you did, cristal? You don't want to piss me off, darlin', now that we're friends. No, you shouldn't get pissed off. It makes you look older. Nomi! - Yeah? You got it. - L1 do? Marty and gay are gonna work with you. I talked to Phil. We'll get some glossies taken. You did good. I'll call you for dinner. We'll have some lobster. Hey, did you ever hear Caesar sing? You'll love it. What? - Congratulations. I see you have many talents. I thought she did good. I didn't even know about the audition until afterwards. Do you like my nails? They're not as nice as yours. Maybe I'll help you with yours sometime. If you want. Isn't that nice of you, darlin? What are friends for? On second thought... I'm not sure I want you to do mine. I'm gettin' a little too old for that whorey look. I'll think about it. Ok. Close the door on your way out. Hey, bring on the real dancers! Boo! Shit, get off! All right! All right! Enough of this stuff! Let's dance! Hey! - Hey! I loved it! It was good. What are you doin' here? Slummin'? Heather! Were we good? Hope! You were great. She dances like a truck! I do not! Do you want somethin' to drink? Yeah, get me a beer, bitch. Look what I got. It's beautiful. I stole it from my grandmother. You did not! You got it at a pawnshop. We're gettin' married. You love her? I don't know. She's havin' a baby. Hm. What about this? We ain't any good. You heard them. "Get outta here!". "Get off the stage!". What are you gonna do? Work in a grocery store. Her mother owns it. We'll get a discount on baby food. See ya. Shit happens, you know? Life sucks. I'm a student of t-shirts! Hey, Nicky. Hey! - What's goin' on? What do you mean, what's goin' on? Cool it, all right? You told me I got it, and than that? She threatened to walk! She got her lawyers into it! So what? So she's a big star! You're not worth it. Sorry, nomi. I tried. Fuck! Basically my g-string snapped. So, there I was dancin' butt naked for 5 minutes. I mean, my poor partner! Hey. I thought about it, darlin'. You think you could do my nails now? Oh. Ok. Maybe some other time. Come on, slave girl. Let's go. We've only got 5 minutes. Go, go! Go, you guys, run! Go, run, run, run! Go! Go, run! Run, Daryl, go! You guys, let me through! Cristal, can you hear me? Somebody get Marty here! Marty! What the hell happened? I don't know. Somebody get an ambulance, now! Who was behind her? I was. - What happened? I don't know. She just went down. She slipped. I saw it. Nomi wasn't even close to her. Tough break, huh? What's the matter? - Nothing. All right, thanks. Keep me informed. Well, she's got a concussion. That'll be all right. But she's got a compound fracture of the right hip. You know how long those take to heal? We gotta shut the show down. Not a chance. The show goes on. The stardust is never dark. It has never been. It never will be. Not while I'm alive. Who was her understudy? Well, we had a girl who... What's funny? Cristal Connors is a star, Sam! You can't just replace her. What if we could just bring somebody in while she's recuperating? She could be out for a year, Phil. Like who? Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul. Paula Abdul? In my show? We're not gonna pay those kind of salaries. Well, in that case, mister karman, we do what we do in Vegas. What? We gamble. Ladies and gentlemen, the stardust proudly presents miss nomi Malone. We could've brought anyone into this show. Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul. Nomi Malone is what Las Vegas is all about! She's dazzling, she's exciting and very, very sexy. Thank you, Zack. How did you feel about the show tonight? I just hope that I can be as good as the show. You are, my dear. You are the show. Thank you. Hey, you ready to party? Where? The paradiso. I rented out the bungalows. For what? For you. - Yaaay! Hurry up. I got a limo waiting for us. I don't have anything to wear! You do. Andrew carver's coming. He saw the show. He thought you were great! He... did you hear that? Andrew carver is gonna be there! Yeah, I heard. - Hey, what's wrong with you? You pushed her, didn't you? No! How can you talk that shit to me? Julie saw it. She couldn't have seen it. I saw Julie, and her back was to you. She saw it. Wow. Ok. Have fun at your party. - Molly! Molly. Come here, Molly! You gotta come! Andrew's gonna be there. I don't care. Molly, it ain't a party without you. Let go of me. Let go of me! Bravo! Bravo! Tony! Surprise! Go on, go. One minute. Excuse me. Oh my god. Oh my god. So, what I want to know is where's Andrew? Look. I love your outfit. - Thank you. Nomi, think I could be your understudy? I'll see what I can do, ok? Thanks, darlin'. Hey, Andrew carver's here. Come on, I want to introduce you. Andrew's here! Zack. How you doin', man? Hey, man, how you doin'? Andrew carver, nomi Malone. You were sensational tonight. Thank you. Zachary? Wherever did you find her? I'll never tell. I like your songs. Thank you. You know, uh, I like your ass. Call me. Molly Abrams. Andrew carver. Hi, Molly. Andrew. I can't even thread a needle anymore. - Sorry? Molly's one of your biggest fans. Well, then let me get you a drink. Ok. Come on. Oh my god. Enjoy. You look beautiful tonight. Thank you. What's goin' on? Just wanna party, baby. Let me go. Let me go! - Shut the fuck up! Throw her down! Fuck her! Shut up, bitch! Get me some black pussy! Fuck her, man. Fuck her! Fuck the bitch! I could fall in love with you. Let's get outta here. Molly? We have her sedated. She's in shock. She has a broken nose, vaginal tears. She'll be here 3 or 4 days. Zack, Zack! I got this for you. And look at this. And look at this. Later. Where are the police? They're not here. Why the fuck aren't they here? Because they're not coming! Fuck! - Don't do it, Polly. How did you find out? You were busted for disturbing the peace at the crave club. The police took your fingerprints. I don't have to listen to this. Yes, you do! You're Polly Ann costello! Your father killed your mother, then killed himself! You ran away from a foster home in Oakland, December 1990! Arrests: Denver, soliciting. - Stop it! San José, Cheyenne, soliciting! Possession of crack cocaine! Assault with a deadly weapon! Tell me, why did you stop hooking? You had your future pretty well mapped out for yourself. I did what I had to do. Just like you did with cristal. I'm not a whore. No, you're not. You're gonna be a big star. Your face is gonna be up on billboards. And you're gonna make a lotta money for the stardust. You're not gonna let him get away with this? Carver is at the paradiso this year, but he might be at the riviera next year, or the stardust the year after that. He's part of the team. So are you. What about Molly? You like her, I'll make sure he gives her enough money. She can have a dress shop. Tell me something. What did you charge? Hooking. 50. 100 sometimes. You got low self-esteem, baby. You're a fantastic fuck. I was paying you a compliment. Showtime. Andrew carver, please. Hello, baby. - Hi. Lookin' good. He's ready for you. It didn't take you long. - No. I like you better topless. Wait till you see me bottomless. I'm waiting. Take the rest off. Sure. You make a sound I'll fuckin' kill you! Fucker! Fuck off! He says he wants to sleep. Tired him out, huh? Yeah. She's still out. It's the medication. Is she ok? - She's ok. Molly? Molly... I just went to carver, and I kicked the shit out of him. I love you. Cristal Connors, please. Room 319. You know the best advice I ever gave you? If you're the only one left standin' up there... They'll hire you. Thank you and good night, ladies and gentlemen. Cristal has left the building. I'm sorry, cristal. Yeah. I know just how sorry you are. How do you think I got my first lead? There's always someone younger and hungrier coming down the stairs after you. Why didn't you tell anyone? Oh hell, darlin'. I needed a rest. Besides, my lawyers have gotten me a real nice settlement. I gotta go. Aren't you gonna give me a big kiss? Bye, darlin'. Bye, darlin'. Come on! Hurry up! Well, hop in, pard. This here's your lucky day. Right. Let's go. So, did you gamble? Did you win? What'd you win? Me. - Oh fuck. It's you. I want my fucking suitcase, asshole! Hey! Hey! Wait a minute, wait a minute! I'm drivin'! Jesus fuckin' Christ! Watch the fuckin' road! Be cool. I'll get your suitcase.
