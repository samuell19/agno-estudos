Yes? That's me. That's correct. Okay... Well, shouldn't a diva have the right to express... "Take your meds!" Okay... So the sounding body and the frequencies... Does that go for the amplitude as well? If that's the case, the interference of the LFO... Listen, I've got to go. I'll get back to you. Clara? Sure, I understand. Let's assume that the character of the frequency handles that, then the LFO shouldn't collide, right? Really? Hang on... I'll be damned! 1.618. The LFO does collide! Let's check if the transients are a problem in that octave. That's interesting... You've tried it, right? In quarter band or octavo band? Of course it's all theoretical, but... - Why? - Because. - That's no answer! - That's no question. - Do you really want go there again? - No, it's pointless... So it's all my fault? You avoided me, went and played with your toys in the basement. - I wanted something more. - Something more? You mean someone else. Robert? I'm leaving now. I'm going to see... - Your lover. - ...Linda. I'm taking the car. Don't take the car. So things are a bit rough. I'll just have to deal with it. That's life for you, a bunch of ups and downs. I still have my job, but right now I'm on sick leave... Sorry for interrupting, but our "combo plan" would save you 77 kronor a month compared to your current plan. In addition, the contract is only for 18 months as opposed to 24... - I'm trying to sleep, you know. - What? What did you say? That I'm trying to get some sleep! Well, you've been trying to do that ever since it happened. You only have yourself to blame. - So how does tinnitus affect you? - You get used to it. But it was hard to get any sleep. Until I found a trick... - As funny as it seems: Death metal. - Really? My son is into it and one night, I borrowed his iPod... For some reason, it helped me to block out noise. - Fascinating! Let's listen to... - "Kluxxa". To Kluxxa, and see if it puts our audience to sleep. Then I saw that five hours had passed. Five hours! I need to do some calibrating, but... The signals emitted by the brain when you suffer from tinnitus, they provide us with the body's behavioral, cognitive, physiological and psychological predisposition for certain sounds. But they also... Hang on... They are also relevant when it comes to phylogenetics. Even if "phantom" sounds like tinnitus... But Sinus-San, we are talking about prenatal cognition, right? And who's that? Sure, he can join in. Hi. What's your name? Welcome to our discussion. Actually, it was my wife who set all this in motion. She's into yoga, and listens to this cheesy relaxation music. You know: Synth pads mingled with ocean waves, sitars and all kinds of hippie instruments. Something about that music just made me snap. What the hell is this? - What is this godawful music? - It's for yoga. - Could you turn it down? - No. Hey! What's wrong with you, Robert?! Robert, take your meds! Right... Scramble down to the basement and hide in your Fortress of Solitude! Maybe the idea wasn't born then, but it's the first incident I recall. And after that, they just piled up. Well... "Sound allergy" might not be the correct terminology, but that's how I describe my condition. And after some investigation, I realized that I'm not alone. And now three of us with "sound allergy" are talking online. But let's get to the point. You're up to speed on this, right? Then my first question is: Do you want to change the world? Hello. Hope this isn't inconvenient. I'm Linn. Your new neighbor. Hi, I'm Robert. I'll be back to introduce myself properly... But the movers want some coffee. I've found the machine and the coffee, but no... - No filters? - Exactly! Do you have any to spare? The couch goes in the room on your right. Your other right, please! ...nothing is wrong with the car model so it will not be recalled, in spite of the recent accident that left two people dead... Our genetics are hardwired for sound cues, frequencies that trigger reactions. We have to access this "sound manual". You know, I bet this is only the tip of an iceberg. This might sound completely ridiculous, but... The Nobel Prize. In a few years, of course. I just finished watching it. Ten minutes! I just sit there, completely relaxed. I haven't been that relaxed since... Sure... But don't you get it? Those four frequencies made me relax. They blocked out everything else. What if we only needed ten minutes of sleep every day? My parents smoked, ate sweets, and drank alcohol, yet remained thin. Well, these days we just sit in front of our computers. We have pizza delivered to our door and stuff ourselves with treats 24/7. We quit using sugar in our coffee but eat cookies instead. You don't like cookies. You don't like candy. You don't like sweets. Documentation is now necessary. Today is... ...January 21. I might just have discovered that these frequencies act as some kind of portal, a means to exert influence. Due to the risk potential, I've decided to keep my findings to myself. In the wrong hands, this could produce disastrous consequences. Further testing is vital. Time for phase two. "Phase Two" Hello! - Nice weather! - Sure is! Why don't you and your family come over for some coffee tonight? - Not tonight, I'm afraid. - How about tomorrow? 2 o'clock? - Sure. - Great. - What a lovely home. - Thank you. - Where's the rest of the family? - They died in a car crash a while back. Oh... - I'm so sorry. - That's okay. I'm just not ready to deal with the practical matters yet. - Milk? - Yes, please. - That was awkward. - Five minutes, then I'm out of here. This is just too... You think... ...your new neighbor is such a great guy. Simon... You'd like to help me wash my windows. Linn... You find me... ...somewhat attractive. You're developing feelings for me. Simon, you won't remember... You don't notice this. To you, I'm just a great guy. And you won't remember this at all. Nice guy. - Considering... - ...what he's been through. Milk. Thanks... - Doesn't it get lonely without them? - Yes. But I guess you get used to it. I could come over and keep you company now and then. Definitely. I mean... Neighbors should stick together. You know what? I'm planning to wash our windows. - I could do yours at the same time. - I appreciate that. - So nice of you to stop by! - I'll come back soon. You like cookies. In moderation. You like cookies. In moderation. ...according to the prosecutor, who has opened an inquiry. A man was killed today in a bungy jump. A documentary filmmaker is suspected of pressuring the man into jumping... I see your point, but I don't have the time to pursue this. And honestly... ...I don't think there was anything to it. Possibly in theory, but... But I think we so desperately just wanted it to work. I've got to go. Hi! Those coffee filters just slipped my mind. Here's some coffee too, to make up for it. Thank you. You really didn't... Good excuse to ask me in for a cup of coffee. Is it some kind of hypnosis? Have we passed the Alpha Stage? More thorough tests must be conducted. Yes? Dr. Moog, I presume? - Excuse me? - It's me, "Sinus-San"! We were onto something, weren't we? - What do you mean? - We're on the right track. I can sense it! And you're trying to hide it from me. No. - Did you find the frequencies? - They don't exist. - It was just a crazy idea. - You're lying! And I contributed to this too! What do you want? - I want a fair deal. - Well, it was flawed. So I would like you to leave now. This isn't over yet. I'll find my way out. And in too, for that matter. - Are you threatening me? - Catch you later... I'm sorry, Clara. But you ruined our marriage. Like you're doing to the neighbors? - That's science. - Screwing her in our bed? I need to find out how deep the hypnosis is. You've always been so full of crap. Do you actually believe that? - I know it's the truth. - Like I knew our marriage was crap? - It had its moments. - Oh, really? - I can show you. - Okay... - I made cinnamon rolls, want some? - That's very sweet of you. Listen, I want to show you something... Wow... What's all this? Now listen... There's something I want you and Simon to do. - Monsieur? - Oui. - Madame? - S'il vous plait. I really appreciate this. - It's my favorite restaurant. - I know. Only the best is good enough for you. - How did you know? - I asked your friends. What else did you ask? A kiss, and I will reveal that too. - Do you remember? - Oh yes. I pretended you were Paul Newman. The whole restaurant was watching. And then we went to your place. And fell asleep on the couch! This is wrong. And you know it. It's science. And occasionally, you have to disregard the moral aspects. Look at the Milgram experiment, or Harry Harlow's monkey experiment. Don't you see the possibilities, Clara? I can see that you're ill. I can see that you need help. I see that you need to take your medication. And I see that this is all wrong. I show you something beautiful, and you choose to see something ugly. Not even trying to understand, that's... That's being ignorant. It's pathetic. Pathetic... What the hell? Hey... What are we doing here? They... They said on the radio... Hang on! What are you doing? Okay... This is the deal: You weren't actually here. You came over to borrow some coffee. That's right, you came over to borrow some coffee. Let's go. Isn't there something weird about this? - What do you mean? - It's five in the morning. - Here! - Thank you. Bye-bye... - Hi. - Well, hi! Like some coffee? Sorry. We're on our way to Copenhagen. Would you mind keeping an eye on our house while we're away? My pleasure. Thank you. - We'd be glad to return the favor. - That's great. - All right, have a great weekend. - Have a nice trip. "Fair is fair!" Holy shit, look at all these flyers! They're no friends of the environment. I'll go take a shower. Hi. I'm back. We went to Copenhagen for the weekend. It was nice. That sounds like a good idea. I just wanted you to know that I'm back. I'll call you later. Bye! Simon... Tell Linn that you're going to the supermarket. Make sure you get everything you need! Linn... You invited your delightful neighbor over. And he will be there any second now. - Hello, come on in. - Thank you. It's still a mess, we haven't lived here very long. I've lived here for 15 years, and you've seen the state of my home. What do you need the earplugs for? Linn... There's nothing you'd rather do, than have sex with me. Robert... I want you, now! Honey, I'm home! Whose shoes are these? Do we have company? What the fuck!? What the hell is going on?! I'm going kill you, you motherfucker! What is that? This is what happened. I wasn't here. Linn is nude because she just got out of the shower... And now... Simon, you will prepare a romantic dinner. The two of you will have a romantic evening. And I wasn't here. Okay? I wasn't here. I'm sorry... - You are such a loser. - I know... - But I miss... - Me? Sex. - What about me? - I miss you. Then why did you kill us? It was an accident. - You tampered with the brakes. - Yes, but... - I didn't mean to kill you, Sebastian. - Just me. I didn't know that your mom was going to pick you up. I loved you so much. But I couldn't take knowing that you were with him. - I thought we had a perfect marriage. - Wake up! Nothing's perfect. And you, with your crummy, gray personality... How do you change the world? From the inside? That's got to be where to start. Your values shape your world. Sound values promote growth. The family is the cornerstone. "The Family" - Good morning. - Good morning, darling. There's fresh coffee. - Is Sebastian asleep? - I heard him in the shower. He can't be late for school. - Good morning, Daddy. - Good morning, son. Have some cereal. What the hell are you up to? - Clara? - Yes? - Could you bring me my slippers? - Of course, dear. - Sebbe? - Yes, Daddy? - Time for school. - Okay. - Bye-bye. - Bye. You are so fucked up. - You know what? - What? You don't exist. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Today we'll continue with the manifest. Where did we leave off? Sebastian? Common sense and independent thinking. - That should be our yardstick. - Exactly. Many people turn to religion and the law but those are simply external factors. But actually, we already have what it takes. We have a sound compass... But which direction would the world take then? Most likely we'd see chaos and anarchy, abandoning common sense... How will multinational companies survive? It will be difficult. Because the balance of power will have changed. Right... You are now our butler. I have a list of things I want you to do. Take care of the kitchen. Go ahead, write this down. Vacuum the whole house. The gable by the kitchen is peeling. Fix that with some sandpaper. Next... Hello, we're from the police. Can we come in? Well... sure. Have you seen your neighbors lately? - They've been missing for a few weeks. - Missing? Gee... - Have you seen them? - Well... Maybe... When they moved in, I guess. - Maybe your wife has seen them? - She is dead. Oh. My condolences. Maybe the person vacuuming has seen them? Well, I... There's... Come on in. - Hello. Coffee? - But aren't you... Okay. This is the deal: A friend of the neighbors told you they're going through a rough patch. They went off to smooth things over. You will close this case. And you will never return to this address. Goodbye. - Coffee? - I'd love some. We need money. I need your help, Sebbe. What do you want me to do? ...the apparently lone robber escaped with about 800,000 kronor. So now I have money. But am I any happier? Possibly... Or am I stuck in a rut? Maybe I just need to try something new? The possibilities are endless. Endless... Absolutely endless... This isn't working... It's all logistics and planning. It's bland... There are no dynamics. This family isn't working. Now it's time for you to go back to being Linn and Simon. Tell your friends you went away... ...to smooth over rough patch. You won't remember a thing about what took place here. I'm just a neighbor you barely know. Now clear out! What? What are we doing here? Go home and make dinner. Would you please leave! - What the hell? - What? Look in the fridge! All the food has gone bad. How is that possible? You went on a trip and forgot to empty the fridge. Everything's just hunky-dory. Go and fuck or something. I don't know, but... Something's off. I love this house, but at the same time, I just want to get away from here. It's like something bad happened here. Okay. Let's sell it. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Oh, sweetheart... I'm so relieved. I'll call the real estate agent tomorrow. The kitchen is freshly remodeled. It has all the latest appliances. You think it's awful! You don't want to live here! - It's not what we are looking for. - It looked nice in the ad. But it's not my cup of tea. As I said on the phone, the top floor is spacious... This street is the front line for the local gangs. Almost every night they clash. They like to cut people, pour on salt and stitch the wounds up! Welcome! Here we have... When they built the house, they ran out of cement. So the builders added poop to make it go further. That's why it stinks, if you're wondering. What's that smell? - What are you up to? - Why are you here? - Now you're just a mean old man. - Just gloating. - Looks like I'm better off dead. - What's wrong with me? Is talking to your dead wife normal? Maybe it's time to change? Stop living in the past. Find a purpose. Experience life. Live it! Beat it. - Hi! - Hello? - Linn. Your neighbor? - Yes. Of course. Can I borrow some eggs? I'm making pancakes. - Are you making music? - Sort of. I have to go to the basement to get more eggs. Hey, sexy. Are you busy tomorrow? Okay... How about an hour of "badminton fucking"? No, she went to the neighbor to borrow some eggs. I'll erase your name from the call list. Then again, there's nothing strange about me talking to her sister. - What the...? - I'll call you later. Bye. How the hell can we hear this? - What a mess. - Shut up! - What? - Not you... Let's put everything on hold... Sit down. So, what's your plan? That bastard is cheating on her with her own sister! Sounds like it. What are you going to do? Look... My hobby is ornithology... Birdwatching. There's this owl around here... ...that caught my interest. So I have a parabolic microphone. And it must be pointing at your house. Sorry... Are you making fun of me? Stay put! "Owls feed on prey, and often take it by surprise." "The eyes are positioned frontally for stereoscopic vision." They have excellent vision and hearing. The eyes are placed frontally for stereoscopic vision. Many have a flat face. And some have ear tufts... Some have... tufts. What the hell? And with my sister?! - They need counseling. - It sure worked for us, didn't it? - I'll cut your balls off! - Okay, stop it! If our therapist hadn't been so god-damned neutral, he might have made a difference. I can help them. You always were so unintentionally funny. You believe that your neighbor is a therapist. You have an appointment with him tomorrow at ten. Tonight, you will behave. And tomorrow you get to talk to a therapist. - Now go to bed. - Can't miss this! - Out of my house, bitch! - Half of it is mine. - You're dead... - So what? There... Tell me about it. He's fucking my sister. And God knows who else. No one else. I swear. Is it okay, what you've done? Who? Me? Yes, you. - Or do you think Linn is to blame? - Yes, I damn well do. - What's that supposed to mean? - I like to know that too. She's so incredibly... - You know... - What? "Un-horny". - What? - Let Simon finish. - She is always tired. - And you're not? You always come home tired. Simon, is it possible that you come home... ...sexually satisfied, that you've had your fill of sex? Yeah, maybe... - But she forced me into this. - You must be joking?! Look, I love Linn. But I have needs... Linn's sister looks very much like Linn. So in a sense it's like having sex with Linn. That's rich! By having sex with my sister, you're having sex with me? - Am I supposed to believe that? - That's how I feel. - How do you feel, Linn? - How I feel? Like whacking him over the head with a hammer. - Good. - Good?! - It's good to feel something. - I know what! - I want to fuck your brother. - Lasse?! What the...? All right, fuck him. - Is there something wrong with him? - Christ, have you seen Lasse? - No. - He's my brother, for God's sake! Exactly. Fucking him would be like fucking you. Right? Then fuck him! Fuck whoever you'd fucking like! Time for a break! Just stay put. How entertaining... A question, Clara. Do you think Simon would get it if he knew Linn was with someone else? - You mean you, don't you? - Hypothetically, it could be me. But I... You mean you. You will accept everything I'll say. Would you consider me neutral ground? - Yes. - I guess. What if Linn slept with me? Then you would get your punishment, Simon. And you would have revenge. Does that sound reasonable? Yes. Yes... Good, then we have a plan. Do you want the yolk to be intact? Or should I pop it? - I like it intact. - So do I. And I prefer slightly runny yolks. Salt and pepper? How are things with Simon? They're okay... He isn't so thrilled about you and me, but he's taking his punishment. - What would you like for him to do? - Stop fucking around. I was thinking more in terms of your relationship. Would you like him to be more attentive? Take you on trips? Buy flowers? - I would love if he... - ...helped out more at home. The vacuuming. The dishes. Watering the houseplants. Surprising her with gifts. Flowers, clothes, shoes, something nice to eat. Rub her feet. A lot... She misses that. Apparently something you used to do? Well... That brings us to the end of today's session. I guess now we'll... - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. You've been coming here for two months now. Please tell me how you feel. - Good. - Pretty good. He helps out more at home. Brings gifts. Gives me foot rubs all the time. - So I guess it's good. - That's nice. Almost like we've turned a corner, right? You're going to be just fine. Here's what we'll do. Ask each other one honest question, and be totally honest when you answer. Simon? Do you love me? Honestly? Yes. Well done. A good question and a good, honest answer. Linn? Are you still fucking my sister? Yes. For fuck's sake! I was supposed to be honest, right? Forgot about that? Silly you... - Should I go after her? - You're an idiot! - Were you aware of that? - No. But now I am. Why don't you just lie down and die? Okay. Simon, did you just stop breathing? Okay. Breathe. - Should I run after her? - Honestly... I don't think she wants to talk to you right now. - Hi. - Hello... - Robert Nord? - That's correct. - Can I come inside? - What's this all about? HBR 501. Come on in. Coffee? I'm fine. Can I get you anything else? We can't see... We can't see how this adds up. See what? And who are "we"? When we analyze our test results it just doesn't add up. Okay... You see, I'm here to... ...make sense of this. Let's do a little test. Sit there and pretend you're driving. Drive carefully. You approach a pedestrian crossing, with some school children. What do you do? You continue driving, the children have passed... SUDDENLY A CAT CROSSES THE ROAD! - I don't really understand... - The point? People tell me that all the time. Would you say that your wife was a good driver? - Well, I don't know... - You don't? - What I mean is... - HBR 501 was registered in your name. Yes, that's right. So... do you let just anyone borrow your possessions? - This was my wife. - That's not what I asked. Do you know what it would cost us to recall that model? - No. - A lot. We have the best resources, the best lawyers. All we need is your signature. Right there... It says that you enter an agreement with us, that relieves us from all liability. Or we dig up everything we can find... should this matter go to court. Can someone get the door? Your sisters? Hi. Listen... Could you keep an eye on this? Girls! The party's over. Come here and get your money. Is that it? Thank you. Good night. Sit down... Thanks. I don't understand. - He's a bastard. - No, not that. My behavior, I don't understand it. I've done things that have felt okay. That have been my own decisions in some strange way. Things that I would normally never do. - Like what? - Sleeping with you. - Okay. - There's more... And somehow, you're involved. Are you looking for this? You're always holding this when I'm around... What's it for? Stay in here. - He saw you coming here. - Honey, forgive me. You're my everything. I'm going to bed. Just close the door when you leave. Good night. Does this feel good? I'm... going to bed... Just close the door when you leave. Good night. ...now suggest that there was nothing wrong with the car model, that is was an act of sabotage, even murder. Obviously, that would suit the car manufacturer, but you can't help but wonder... Exactly. You can't help but wonder... - What the hell are you doing here? - Sit down. Unless you want the police to show up and ask questions? Sit. Now. I know what you're up to. You're sharp. Not even I pictured that. Don't even think about it! How do you operate it? Press the GO button to activate it. My word is your command. Press the button. Give me the remote. Okay, Sinus-San... Here's what we'll do. Take them. You need them. They turn me into a zombie. You already are a zombie. Without them you don't make rational decisions. I guess you weren't taking them when you tampered with the car. So I died. Along with our son. Now you've stumbled upon something bigger, much more powerful. And the neighbors? What have you done? And that guy? Is he alive? So you want to die? Good call. The right decision, for once. The world will be better off without you. The world is sick either way. I could change that. - So you're not going to die? - Apparently not. - Too bad. - Some would say! Most people would. - What's the plan this time? - Common sense. Do you even know what that means? - Go ahead and taunt me now... - And later. Soon everyone will know my name. Time to go home and pack a bag. Then you're off to North Korea. Okay? You won't remember me or my invention. Go. ...that a crime has been committed, according to the prosecutor. I can't go into details, but certain testimonies indicate crime... - Hello, Robert Nord. - HBR 501? We have looked into this matter in depth and we have procured more information. I'll get straight to the point. You tampered with the car, didn't you? She stood right here by the open window. I was out front, topping up the oil in the car. Then her phone rang. Hi... I'm at home. Just hang on for a second. Robert? - Robert! - I heard her. But I didn't say anything. He's not at home. I love you too. What? Yes, I co-own the house. Let's talk about that tonight. I told him that I'm going out with a girlfriend. Love you... Bye. It had crossed my mind, but this confirmed it. So I yanked out a cable. Honestly, I don't know which one it was. It was the brakes. I had no idea that Sebbe was going with her. I advise you to contact an attorney. And then call the... You have no compassion. But I will give that to you. It's a gift from me to you. From now on, you will be touched by everything people say. Your heart to overflow with kindness. You won't remember me, or what I've told you. You may leave now. I'm sorry... Do as I tell you! ¡Haz lo qeu digo! Do as I say! Ici, c'est moi qui decide. Ici, c'est moi qui decide. "The World 1.0" Thank you for robbing the bank. Again. I've decided to broaden my horizons, so I will be going on a journey. In the meantime, you will take care of my home. I've made this list for you. "Simon and Linn, to do:" Water my plants. Switch on some lamps at night, make it look like someone's at home. Also, have the radio on at a low volume, for the same reason. I don't want anyone to break in. In the daytime, lights off. I don't want to come home to a whopping electricity bill. This is a great opportunity to clean the whole house. Put out some garbage out occasionally, so the place looks occupied... Flyers and other paper-related trash go in paper carrier bags in the hallway. No plastics. This household recycles! Right... Don't touch my synthesizers! They are so fucking expensive! I want you to collect all of Clara's belongings and put the boxes in the basement. I want that bitch out of my life. Items that might have been Clara's go in a box marked with a question mark. I'll go through it when I get back. When all that is done, I want you to repaint Sebastian's room. And you pay for the paint. No cheap paint, okay? I want quality paint. Maybe a shade like off-white or eggshell. Then there's the attic and... Well, it's all in here. Go ahead and read it... There. I've put my phone number in there too. Listen up... Now I've seen the world... ...and it's sick. Both physically and mentally. But I am the medicine. What are you going to do? The question is... ...what WE are going to do? We are going to change the world with music. That sounds a bit clich?(Copyright). Maybe so. Let me put it this way: My lyrics will have a bit more impact than the regular kind. They are more like... ...instructions that will be hard to resist. - That sounds like hubris. - You know that I can't play, don't you? It doesn't matter, the way music sounds today. Some bass drum and some "blip-blop" and the audience will go bananas! Man, that was damn good! You think this is awesome! - That was amazing! - So damn good! - I'm so psyched! - Me too! The kids will love this. I get Mike Oldfield vibes, only as if he were from outer space. This music is galactic! I am so proud. I'm proud of you, darling. You should be proud. You've done a great job tonight. Take the rest of the night off and enjoy it. What are you doing? What's this fantasy you're living in? Isn't it time to return to the real world? Seems like reality's caught up with you. Hello? Robert? Robert please, I see you're in there... Can't you sleep? Without my medication, I can't sleep... With it, I can. Then sleep. Sleep. I'm too afraid. - Why? - I keep having the same dream. What dream? Where you die. "The Manual" I have this list that will help us put together the real list. The one we will call "The Manual for a Better World". For this list to be truly genuine it's vital that we don't censor ourselves. We need to be totally honest. Okay? It feels like it would take eons to reach that kind of awareness. So I think it should be prohibited. - Anything else? - Religion? What should we do with it? I'm not sure the world would be better without it. - Me neither. - Neither do I. It gives people comfort and moral fiber... Right? Let's remove it. If it doesn't work out, we'll put it back in. That's the spirit! - You're serious about this? - Very much so. Isn't it time for The World 2.0? I'm not so sure. Given that this was possible to implement, wouldn't it create an overpopulated world with an imposed balance that yielded unexpected consequences? I think it's more complex than we can grasp. Big changes need to evolve over time. I believe in mankind. We seek improvements, not deterioration. Most people aren't ruining the planet on purpose. - Nature takes its course. - The world should do its own thing? To put its future in our hands is a bit... We're too small. - How do you mean? - We're just ordinary people. Sure, it's our world and we should have a say. But we can't really see the big picture. We're not... Not? God. What characteristics define a god? Understanding, forgiveness, fairness... Omniscience. Kindness, acceptance, faithfulness. Acting in the best interests of this planet. Thank you.
