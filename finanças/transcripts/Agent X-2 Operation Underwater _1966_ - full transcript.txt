(dramatic music) (mysterious music) (radar beeping) Target submarine 20 degrees to port, sir. Stand by to track. Stand by to track. - [Officer] Stand by to track. (dramatic music) General quarters! - [Officer] General quarters. (radar beeping) Target in range, sir. Stand by number one torpedo. Stand by number one torpedo. - [Officer] Range, plus four. - [Officer] Doppler reading zero plus four. - [Officer] Doppler reading zero plus four. - [Officer] Telemetry circuit, check. (alarm buzzing) Telemetry circuit, check. All systems check, sir. They're ready, Commander. Good. (reporters chattering) Gentlemen and ladies of the press, in behalf of the Pacific Command, let me welcome aboard for this demonstration of the Navy's new homing torpedo. Slide A. (reporters chattering) This should be interesting. The Bloodhound, the Navy's latest underwater search and attack device, built into it is the most sophisticated and infallible sensing and homing mechanism known today. This is a theoretical search and attack situation. From the moment that the target is sighted, precise guidance information is fed to the torpedo. Then, through the application of a new electronic device, the torpedo memorizes the location of the target and continues to do this until it unerringly reaches its goal. Hey, Commander. Now, before you ask any questions, I would like to show you the tactical situation for this demonstration. This is the attacking submarine, the ship we are on. This is the target, which is 3,000 yards on a northwest bearing from our ship. At the present time, we are T-minus one minute to attack. Commander? And the target submarine? It is unmanned. By remote control, every effort will be made to have it avoid and dodge the torpedo. I thought that nothing could dodge this torpedo. You were just telling us that. So I did. Is it possible for the torpedo's memory to fail, to make a mistake? Is there any chance of it turning back on us? A good question. If something went wrong, it could turn back on us, but I guarantee you 99% that it won't. What about the other 1%? That bothers me. Well, it would bother us all. (both chuckle) Gentlemen, we are now T-minus 30 seconds. Richard? Hm? That guy over there, isn't he Professor Howard of the Atomic Center? - [Richard] Yes. What's he doing here? I wonder if atomic disposal plans are here. Sir. Does this test have any kind of connection with atomic energy? Save your questions until after the demonstration, please. Now watch. We will be able to observe the entire demonstration through this monitor. Jenny. You're white as a sheet. What's wrong? I don't know, Bill. I'm shaky all over. It's all right, Ken. I just sort of have a premonition. T-minus 10 preset. All hands stand by for action. Fire one! (button clicks) (torpedoes whooshing) (devices whooshing) (devices beeping) What are those? Sonic decoys, sondes. They are released to try to confuse the torpedo. (torpedo whooshing) Well, look at that. (reporters chattering) (torpedoes whooshing) Look at that go. (reporters chattering) I've never seen anything like this. (torpedoes whooshing) It's heading toward us! (torpedoes whooshing) (cannons firing) (explosions booming) (screams) (mysterious music) What the hell was that? What went across our screen? Hey. I'm sure I just saw someone abandon that submarine. No. The target sub is controlled by that man in that room. I already told you that. There are no men aboard. A Navy probe then? You see this demonstration? Gentlemen, please don't-- What happened? That was was no problem? Gentlemen, please-- He was right there! There was a man! Gentlemen, please don't get excited. It's probably very easy to explain. It could've been just a drowned body. In that case, shouldn't it rise to the surface? (explosions booming) (people groaning) Turn on the lights. That concludes the test. Excuse me. - [Ken] Commander. Later, not now, please. (reporters chattering) Ken, what's the matter? Nothing. Exactly what I said to him. (group laughs) Shall we go? - [Richard] Well, what do we see here? A lady carrying things for a gentleman. (Ken laughs) Typically Japanese. Well, that's the way things are done in this country. See you later. Mm. - [Richard] Where are they going? Obviously, skin diving. (gentle music) Ken. That man we saw, he still haunts me. Commander Brown said it could've been a drowned body. I've heard divers say that sometimes they'd come across bodies just standing and swaying in the bottom of the sea. Jenny. Yes? I thought just occurred to me. - [Jenny] What is it? The Atomic Waste Center is on the far side of those cliffs straight ahead, which is right near to where they had those tests yesterday. - [Jenny] What are you getting at? Beyond that island, they dump the atomic waste products. It might be connected with the demonstration. We can't get any closer. Let's go. (mysterious music) Crazy reporters. You know them? Always snooping around. I think I know why they're here. That thing in the water? The Navy does know, and is interested enough to order a top secret investigation and to increase in the security around this island. [Professor Howard] That's funny. What is it? Some very peculiar things have been going on around here lately. What? I'm not sure, but I think the Navy should be informed about them. What are you driving at? It appears someone came to the island during the night. At first, I thought this was from some diving gear. But it would never make an impression like this. What do you make of it? I'm not sure. Lots of youngsters insist on skin diving around here. I guess it's because it's forbidden. Professor? Yes? You're wanted in the laboratory. Thank you. Well, Commander, I leave it in your hands and the Navy's. (door thuds) (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (thrilling music) (water bubbling) (Jenny screaming) But it's ridiculous. The whole sea area has been combed. But I saw him, Commander. I saw him! - [Bill] Take it easy, Jenny. He was covered with scales all over. He chased me. It was horrible, just horrible. Mr. Abe, did you see this thing too? No, I didn't, but Jenny did. Weren't you under the water longer than you should've been? And what exactly do you mean by that? You mean it's just a wild, hysterical imagination of a woman, don't you? - [Commander Brown] I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to tell you that you're quite dead wrong, Commander. I can prove what I say. I took a picture of it. - [Commander Brown] And where's the camera? I lost it. You lost it? - [Jenny] I dropped it, but I saw it, I know I did. It's true. - [Commander Brown] It's impossible. Several weird things have been going on around here, so why are you so sure Jenny's all wrong? Have you ever been to a psychiatrist? I'm sorry, I didn't mean any offense. Excuse me. - [Ken] Brown! He's a nice guy, actually. He's just acting under orders. Well. Jenny, are you sure you took a picture of it? - [Jenny] I'm positive I did. I'm going back. I'll find your camera. Ken. Sure, nobody can call us liars. I'm coming too. (static buzzing) (static squealing) Mighty odd. What? If it is a man, where is his diving equipment? If it isn't a man, what is it? Beats the hell out of me. (mysterious music) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) - [Ken] Just jumpy, I guess. (gasps) (screams) (Jenny yelps) (Jenny gasps) (Jenny gasps) (Ken grunts) (Jenny grunts) (punch thuds) (Ken grunts) (screams) (both groaning) Already five hours since they were seen last. How long will their oxygen last? They must've run out of it long time ago. I see. Stop it, Dick. They're not dead yet. Tom. What's the matter? Tom! It's my fault. I think I goaded them into it. I'm going out there. - [Officer] Commander! Look, he's found something! (ominous music) Change the lights. Proceed. (dial clicking) (gentle hum) (high-pitched hum) (high-pitched buzzing) Excellent, excellent. (restraints clacking) (groaning) Jenny. Jenny. Jen... Welcome, Mr. Abe. Feeling all right? You know who I am? Yes, we know who you are. We know all about you. Relax. You're going to be here for a while. Now just take it easy. You're our guests. - [Jenny] Ken. Ken. Jenny. (Jenny gasps) What's happened? Where are we? It's all right. No! (loud thudding) (screen whirs) (Jenny gasps) (dramatic music) (screams) (screen whirs) (screen clacks) (dramatic music) - [Bill] A tough job finding them in this weather. - [Man] Bill. Huh? Meet Mr. Nakamura, Ken's boss. Hi. How do you do? There's no news yet? No, not yet. Our friend Commander Brown's out there. In this weather? With a search party in a sub. We're in a real mess! (winds whistling) (rain pattering) I want you to take a look at this. Lower the screen. Lower the screen. Lights out. (mysterious music) (officers murmur) This is what I was talking about. The young lady we're searching for took this picture. Is that thing alive, Commander? We're going to find out. Whatever it is, we are going after it. Tom, the signal from the base. And? The order has been rescinded. Insufficient grounds for conducting underwater search. Make final sweep for bodies of missing persons, and return to base. Insufficient grounds? What about that?! Those are my orders! Let's have the light. Here, read it for yourself. The dive is canceled. Up periscope! (periscope whirs) Wait. I'm going down anyway! - [Captain] Over my dead body. We're turning back. Don't be so pigheaded! - [Captain] Don't forget, I'm in command here. Come on. You have enough evidence. Those two reporters have found something and something mighty peculiar, and I don't believe those two are dead! I'm convinced they are down there somewhere, alive! Then you better convince the admiral. I just take orders. Stand by with forward beams. Stand by with forward beams. - [Captain] Forward scanners. - [Officer] Forward scanners. (mysterious music) (door hums) Mr. Abe. (door hums) Miss Gleason. Permit me to introduce myself. I am Dr. Rufus Moore. My associate, Dr. Mueller. You are a very enterprising and aggressive young man. And you, my dear, a most courageous young woman. Start talking, Doctor. Tell us what you want. Where are we? (laughs) This is 3,000 feet under the surface of the ocean. You are a newspaper man, I'm sure you've read many articles about the civilization of the future, a world that will be united under one totalitarian government. It is my desire to create such a civilization by first creating the citizens who will inhabit it. Here, we have developed a scientific process that can change our human beings' body and mind into any form we choose. With this incredible formula, we can change man's physical structure to conform to any specific purpose. Are you saying all those weird things we saw are human? (laughs) Mr. Abe, listen to me. Yes? - [Rufus] You are not aware of this, but we thoroughly know your background as specialist in propaganda. Someday, when our goals are reached, we will have need of your services. Whatever you want done, I will not go along with it. - [Rufus] Before you make any hasty decisions, let me tell you why we need you, let me describe my work to you. You won't convince me. - [Rufus] Listen, Mr. Abe. I shall not! I see. I'll show you some of the things that are going on in my underwater base. You can give me your answer then. (door hums) (door hums) (door whirs) (door whirs) (mysterious music) (suspenseful music) (screams) (liquid bubbling) (mysterious music) (device beeping) (gasps) (device beeping) (heart beating) (soft buzzing) Now do you understand, Mr. Abe? What you see here is a water cyborg. Their lungs are now gills. The auditory system is completely transformed, and their minds, if you can call them minds, are memory banks with information fed into them, and controlled by us. (ominous hum) (screams) (Jenny whimpering) They respond to commands through special supersonic signals. Observe. (dial clicks) (ominous hum) (dramatic music) (punch thuds) (punches thudding) (Rufus laughs) (ominous hum) Their minds are only response mechanisms. They have no will of their own. That's horrible. What's the reason, why do you do all this? They are my underwater soldiers. They will protect what I have built. I've seen him somewhere, that doctor. You most likely have. That's Dr. Josef Heim who developed the theory of processed man. He is not, by any means, the only distinguished scientist we have here. Many other people have joined us here, some equally well-known. I offer you the opportunity as well, otherwise, let's just say the alternative won't be too pleasant. (soft tapping) (soft tapping) (soft tapping) Oh, dear God! (yelping) (yelps) (soft cracking) (soft tapping) (button clicks) (gauge crackling) What the devil are they? Sir, the radioactivity in the immediate area is approaching the red mark. How deep are we? We're at 1,800, sir. - [Tom] Look! - [Captain] What is it? - [Tom] Atomic waste. It can't be. The dump area's miles from here, and 20,000 feet down. Radiation is over the safety limit. (gauge crackling) What's going on? Whatever it is, it's not for me. Let's get the hell outta here. Full reverse! Full reverse. No, Ken, you can't do it. Look, Jenny, there's no other way out. Let's do anything he wants, so at least we'll be alive. Ken, you can't do it. You don't know what you're saying. Listen, Jenny. No. (Jenny crying) Jenny, be quiet. Look. (gentle music) Marine snow. Marine snow? Jenny, you don't understand, we're in a bad situation, a risky one. You know, this could mean we'll never go back, and you must be very brave. Please do as I say. Do you understand? Ken. Now, listen, that snow means we're about 3,000 feet under the sea. No way at all for us to get out. What about our Aqua-Lungs? We can get out with them, can't we? Not a chance. The oxygen won't hold out. Oh, Ken. (Jenny crying) Wait. Jenny, there is a way out. What is it? They have badges. Maybe we can steal one. (door hums) (door hums) Dr. Moore is expecting you. Follow me, please. (door hums) (door hums) (door whirs) (door whirs) (footsteps clicking) (mysterious music) (door whirs) (high-pitched whooshes) (spears thudding) (Rufus laughs) - [Rufus] Well, my friends, is this your answer to my offer? Now I have a little surprise for you. (Rufus laughs) Go outside and look. Take a look! Go on, look, Mr. Abe. (Jenny gasps) Ken. (dramatic music) It's Howard. But who or what would want to kidnap the professor? Bob, maybe this will convince the admiral. It's about time the Navy got off its fat behind. I have a feeling this might get the Navy in danger. Whatever the game is, count me in. (airplane whirring) Mr. Nakamura! Professor Howard's been kidnapped. What? Are you sure? It's pretty certain. Get inside, you can tell me what happened. Look! There! They've begun the search again. Turn back. Okay. Is it clear? Don't leave any reef or rock unchecked. - [Officer] Aye aye, sir. Use your ultrasonics to check if you get any unusual responses. Full dive at point D! (submarine whirs) (computer beeping) They're heading for our reef. Relax, Professor. They're both ready, Doctor. Let me know when the sub comes into rocket range. Yes, Doctor. We'll give them a bang up welcome, won't we? (door whirs) (door whirs) (restraints clack) (gasps) You. Professor Howard, we meet under unusual circumstances, don't we? Josef Heim, the one who discovered the theory of processed man. I don't believe it. Mixed up in this? Whatever it is. (chuckles) Yes, and I'll tell you what it is, Professor. It's a world that makes sense! We're a hundred years ahead of you! What you throw away is merely waste we convert to power, power that can shatter the entire Earth to bits, power that is so colossal it staggers the imagination, things we plan, and our plans have a place for you. Howard, you won't! Don't worry, Dr. Abe, I'll never do what they want. You heard me. The choice is yours, but there is no time for protracted deliberation. You must decide quickly, very, very quickly. And you will decide when I show you. You will decide. No! No! No, you can't! No, no, no! No, Jenny! No! No! Ken! No! (Ken grunting) Let me go! Just let her alone! I'll go instead! I will make my own choice. You scum. No! (Ken groans) (Ken grunting) Ken! Ken! Oh, Ken! Ken! (Ken grunts) No. No! No! (Jenny groaning) (door hums) Jenny. Jenny! (Ken grunting) (Ken groaning) Stop, I order you! Stop this. (door hums) (soft hissing) (gentle music) Take a good look, Professor. The skin tissues are the first to change, altered for a new environment. Another interesting aspect is the total elimination of sexual distinction. (satellite dish squealing) (device beeping) Yes! There is something in there. Give me range two. - [Officer] Aye aye, sir. (device beeping) Dr. Moore, sonar impulses. They're searching out our base. We're getting stronger output. Stop all outgoing signals. - [Officer] Yes, sir. Stop all cyborg control signals. - [Officer] Yes, sir. (dial clicks) - [Rufus] Your attention. Stop all signals. We repeat, stop all signals. Stop all signals. (mysterious music) (gentle music) - [Jenny] Ken. Where are we? Ken? - [Ken] I'm here, Jenny. - [Jenny] I can't see you. Where are we? - [Ken] I don't know. I feel so drugged. I feel so heavy all over, Jenny. - [Jenny] It's so quiet here. - [Ken] Jenny, give me your hand. Your hand, Jenny. (Jenny gasps) (screams) (Jenny whimpering) Ken! (yelping) (screams) Jenny. (Jenny screaming) Jenny! (crying) (satellite dish squealing) (device beeping) Sir, readings show an object of different density about 200 yards dead ahead in the reef. Different density than the reef? Yes, sir. Double your output. Aye aye, sir. (soft hum) (satellite dish squealing) (device beeping) Get the missiles ready. - [Officer] But, sir, they'll locate our position. We'll finish them off before they have a chance to do anything about it. (button clicks) (missile roaring) (sonar beeping) Captain, object moving towards us rapidly off the port bow. Hit her hard to starboard! Hard to starboard. Aye aye, sir. Let me have it on scanners. Scanners. (missile roaring) That moves like a missile! - [Tom] Damn it, it is a missile! Stand by number one tube. Set telemetry. Set telemetry. (missile roaring) Fire! (torpedoes whooshing) Stand by rocket batteries. Stand by rocket batteries. (panel whirs) (missile roaring) Sir, they're countering our missile with a homing torpedo. Let's lure it to the surface. (missile roaring) (airplane whirring) Bill! Look! That's a missile! Fire! (missile roars) It's headed right down our throats. (airplane whirring) (explosions booming) Dr. Moore. You still haven't realized you have a great deal to answer for. (chuckles) Well, here's how I'll answer you. Let the cyborgs resume work. Right. (dial clicks) (ominous hum) (gentle music) (soft hissing) (liquid bubbling) You're next, both of you. Professor Howard, I'm afraid the submarine searching for you out there is doomed. Each of these controls four missiles which can blow it to bits. Stop him. Stop! (Professor Howard groans) (chuckles) Stop! (button clacks) Stop! (button clacks) Stop! (buttons clacking) (missiles roar) (sonar beeping) Four missiles, sir, they're coming at us, in pairs. (missiles roaring) Stand by homing torpedoes! Sir, we can't make it. (missile roaring) Dive! Aye aye, sir. Dive! (missiles roaring) (sonar beeping) They're coming at us again, sir. (missiles roaring) Full speed reverse! Aye aye, sir. (missiles whooshing) Close. (explosions booming) (gentle rumbling) (steam hissing) Emergency stations! Emergency stations! Check the reactor and torpedo compartments! Aye aye, sir! (alarm buzzing) - [Officer] Number four compartment secured. - [Officer] Number four compartment secured. - [Officer] Number five compartment secured. - [Officer] Number five compartment secured. - [Officer] Number six compartment secured. - [Officer] Number six compartment secured. (gauge crackling) - [Officer] Strong radioactive reaction, sir. What? We must clear the area. - [Tom] Right! - [Bob] Full speed reverse! Full speed reverse! - [Officer] Full speed reverse. Wait, Bob! Look! That's where the missiles are coming from! (punches thudding) (both grunting) Prepare the X-4 for firing. Prepare the X-4 for firing. Ready to fire. - [Tom] Not the X-4, you'll blow up the whole ocean! The Sea will be safer, we might save those three people! Stop it! I'm in command here! You can't stop me! Now fire! (dramatic music) (missile roaring) (explosions booming) (officer screams) (electricity crackling) (explosion booms) (alarm buzzing) (ominous hum) (officer groans) (guns firing) (gasps) (gun fires) (glass crashes) (gun fires) (officer groaning) What has happened?! The cyborgs have got out of control. (loud rumble) Dr. Moore! Missile outputs have blown, and there are other breaks all over. Get your damage controls working. Watch out for the cyborgs. Lock them out! Hurry, get him! Get him, get him! (guns firing) Shoot! Shoot! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Kill him! Kill him! (guns firing) (spearguns firing) (spears thudding) (officers groaning) (officer yelping) (officer grunting) (officer screams) (Dr. Mueller screaming) (officer grunts) (gun firing) (Dr. Mueller screams) (screams) We have to stop them somehow. (doors whir) (doors whir) (both gasp) (both gasp) Oh, no! No! (officer screaming) (gasps) No. (speargun fires) (spear thuds) (screams) (door whirs) Stop them. Stop them! Dr. Heim, gas is leaking from the gas chambers. - [Josef] Hm. (soft rumbling) (explosions booming) Wow, you hit the jackpot. And I'm going in! (explosions booming) (gun fires) (yelps) (dramatic music) (gun fires) No. No. No. No! No! No. (gun fires) (groans) (gun clicking) (gun firing) (Josef groaning) (soft cracking) (explosions booming) No one leaves! We must evacuate. We can't survive here. No one leaves! Get back to your posts! (door whirs) (guns firing) Surround them! Kill them! Kill them! (glass crashes) (guns firing) Professor. Here. We're here. (switch clicks) (restraints clacking) (door hums) Professor. Dr. Abe. Jenny! (Jenny crying) Jenny. Come on, it's now or never! Jenny, let's go. Ken, I don't want to go back. Why not? I'd rather die! (guns firing) [Professor Howard] Come on, let's go! - [Ken] The badge, Professor. (doors whir) (doors whir) [Professor Howard] This way, hurry up. - [Ken] Professor. Killed by a cyborg he himself created. (loud rumbling) - [Ken] Get back. (speargun fires) (spear thuds) (spear thuds) (Ken groans) (gun firing) (Ken grunting) (kick thuds) (punch thuds) (Ken grunting) (electricity crackling) (loud rumbling) (explosions booming) Suicide! You just can't go out there. Who's to stop me? I'm ordering you! There are three people out there who just might need help! Still ordering?! (all panting) (all gasp) (dramatic music) Jenny. Over there, move! (gun firing) (guns firing) (Ken grunting) (punches thudding) Oh, no! No, stop it! - [Jenny] No! (Ken grunting) (gun fires) (gun firing) (door whirs) (soft cracking) - [Ken] It's all right. (alarm buzzing) Look. It's the atomic pile. It stopped. (device clacking) (timer clicking) The whole place will explode when this figure reaches zero. (gasps) (guns firing) Moore's out there. They're trying to escape? (guns firing) (gun clacks) Don't go out there! They'll kill you. Ken. Dr. Moore, is this the world of the future you dreamed of? What happened to that new university that you wanted? Shut up! Dr. Moore, you're a traitor, as low as they come. If you try to escape, I'll blast you with this. (glass crashes) (door whirs) It's time for me to leave. I bid you farewell. (timer clicks) (tense music) No, you don't! (grunts) (chuckles) (loud rumbling) (gun fires) (kick thuds) (gun fires) (gun firing) (gun fires) (Ken groans) (gun clicking) (kick thuds) (punch thuds) (both grunting) (punches thudding) (both grunting) (punch thuds) (gun fires) You did it. (timer clicks) Let's go! Come on! (doors whir) (doors whir) (gasps) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (doors whir) Jenny! Ken. Jenny, I'll get you out! (door whirs) (door clacks) (explosion booms) (Jenny grunting) - [Jenny] Ken, Ken! (loud thudding) Jenny. (loud thudding) Jenny! (timer clicks) (loud thudding) Ken, Ken! (Jenny grunting) (doors whir) Ken! (both grunting) (punch thuds) (timer clicks) (doors whir) Ken, over there! (timer clicking) (loud roar) (explosions booming) Ken! Jenny! (explosion booms) There they are. Hey, over there. Come on, let's get to them, hurry. Hurry. Hope they've got some news. Hey, Bill, what's the news? Any story of the missing reporters? I don't know, I don't know! What do you mean? We saw an explosion! It was terrible! Bill! There's a call in there from the sub. Huh? Wait, Bill. Jenny's coming around. (chuckles) Yes, I suppose someone's explained what happened. (chuckles) They're all right. Jenny, Bill's on the line, wants to talk to you. - [Jenny] No! No, don't look at me! I don't want anyone to look at me! I don't want to talk to anyone! - [Ken] Jenny, Jenny. (gasps) Oh, Ken. Jenny, you're beautiful, as pretty as always. (chuckles) Professor Howard. [Professor Howard] Yes? Yes. He knew the treatment to cure you. Oh, thank you, Professor. Thank you. You'll be all right now. Come on, Bill's waiting. Oh. Bill! I have a fabulous story to write, a great story! I can't wait to tell you all about it. Yes, yes, everything's all right now. (laughs) Yes, I'm fine. (laughs) (elegant music) (ominous music) (elegant music) Hi, Jenny, Ken! Hi! Hi! Have a nice time! (both laugh) (triumphant music)
