Run, Ileana, while you can... Kiss her good. Or you'll get kissed by all the men... Kiss her good. WOOL DAY In the village of Răchiţele there's a saying: whoever kisses you on Wool Day... will be your partner in life. And the ones who get hitched on this special day will have a bountiful life, without a care in the world. Got a cig? You have a cigarette? I don't! I didn't have one puff since the day before yesterday. Why don't you have them? Has the other one got a smoke? I quit, the day before yesterday. Haven't smoked one since. Nothing! -So you don't have a cig? -Nope. Got a cig, man? BRIDES Man! Where does this one have that magazine from? -It's his! I don't know. -What did I tell you to give him? -I forgot! -Do you see anything through that? He's just looking down in the village. Leave him alone! Come hither! Maybe I do have a smoke left. -You do? -Dunno. Let me see. Maybe here, somewhere. Bică, man! He's going! Where are you going? Bică! Bicuţă! Come with me! Where are you going, Bică? Where are you going? Bică! Bicuţă, what has gotten into you that you ran so fast? -I couldn't catch up with you. -What are you doing? -I'm done! -I brought you your "Brides". Done, I said! For whom are you primping yourself up? Nobody sees you up here. Bică! A joke's a joke, but... If you leave us by ourselves today, that's not good. Right? I do leave you. Who doesn't like it can try to stop me the hard way. Don't get us into trouble, Bică. If that ogre Minteoan hears this, there'll be hell to pay. How long have we been working here, at the sheep pen? -We've been here forever. -Do we have money? -We do. -Do we have a house? -We do. -What good are they to us? We toil all year long and at night we go to bed thinking of sheep? -Our time will come. -When? Before you know it, I'll be daddy's age and I don't know what it's like to have your bed warm when you get home. -He's right, you know... -Shut up! If you go into the village today, he'll sack the three of us. I'm going down to the village, to find myself a woman. What did you say you're doing, Bicuţă? What did you say you're doing, Bicuţă? I said I'm going in the village to find myself a woman. Today, of all days? Yes. What do you two have to say about this? -What do you mean? -You, too, want a day off today? -Definitely not! -No way. Our life is all about the sheepfold. Lads... mark my words. If any one of you leaves the camp today, I fire the whole three of ya. And I'll spread word in the village that you've stolen sheep. No one on Earth will hire you afterwards. Got it? Well... I did. -I did, too. -And you, Bicuţă? Yes. -Good. -I'm still going. I brought you salami. I'll leave it for you in the barn. I'm taking more wool to the fair. Take care, with this guy. You've been a man's man, dude. You stood up to him. He didn't even flinch when he said he'd fire us. When I say a thing, it's set in stone. -I'm a man! -As you say, Bicuţă. What's with him? Man! He croaked! What's with him? -Grab him. -And what do we do? -Grab his hands! -And? To the shed. We leave him there and say he fainted. No worries. And then? If he wakes up, he'll scram in a jiffy. -You're not thinking at all. -Why? If this one wakes up, Minteoan will fire our asses. To the shed! -Leontina... did... the bus... -What's he saying? -Leave? -What?! And I... What are you doing? What did you do? -I must find a solution. -What solution? Grab him! You too! -To the shed! -To the shed? What do we do when he wakes up? What if he doesn't die? -What do we do? -You're right. -Let's go back. -We take him back... -That way! We say he fainted, and... -No worries. -Put him down! -Why? -I got an idea. -What idea? Man! What are you doing? You're nuts! What are you doing? What kind of idea is that? -Grab him. -Again? -And where do we take him? -To the shed. We tie him down... On the chair... Got it? -Yes. -We tie him to the chair... And tell Minteoan he got a sunstroke. And we've put him there to keep him in the shade. -Let me go first... -I don't think you can. Wait! I'll be damned if I carry him one inch further. We gag him, too. And when Minteoan comes, we're clean as a whistle. Grab him. Okay, then. -Here? -No, on the chair. Get him up! Like this... Truss him now. With my belt? Tie it good! Like this. Now gag him. Take that rag. -It's full of salt! -Gag him. Bicuţă... Ready. -Tighter. -You're breaking his teeth! Let's go! -It looks like rain, again. -He's not half-baked, that one. -Who? -Bică. Who said he was half-baked? You scrape a heap of dough, but if you don't have anyone to share it with... Right you are. 'Twas good if we went down in the village for Wool Day. -We'd have find ourselves a woman. -One? Three of them. One for you, one for Bică and one for me. -Like our daddy. -Like daddy. But... where to find a lass here, in the middle of nowhere? Watch out! Man! The sun is out! You stupid fool! What were you thinking? I wanted to take your belt off, see if you're okay! 5 000 euros and you're scratching them with your 12 lei manicure. -I'm sorry! I didn't want to! -You're always sorry! Where the hell are we? Look! No signal. Are you all right? Are you hurt? No. I'm fine. -You did hurt your lip. -Where? -Here... -No... it's lipstick. I wanted to put on some make-up and rammed into the fence. -You're beautiful. -With this stain on my face? With it, too. -Where's the missy going? -I don't know. Ask her. -There are wolves up there! -Beware of wolves! -What? -They said "Go! It's fine!" No! It's not fine! Missy! Don't go there! There are wolves! Let me tell you! When I was a child, a pack of about seven massive ones... Man! What do you want? Why are you following me? It looks it's about to rain. And when it rains, the wolves come. With that dumb girl, I'd rather go alone to the end of the Earth and then plunge head down. Look what she did to me! Look what she did to me! She "wanted to check if I'm fine". She dug her nails into my tits just for the hell of it. Just to hurt me! You understand? How will I film now? 5 000 euros I paid for these boobs! And now I have to hide them? -5 000? You don't even see it. -Beg your pardon? I mean, one can see they're worth 5 000, but they look so natural. Just like two apples. -What happened, miss? -Why are you being so formal? -What do you mean? I shouldn't? -No. I'm not an old hag. You're not. Let me help you... I'm respectful by nature. -Are you hungry? -What did you say? -Are you hungry? -Sorry? -We have cream of whey. -No, I'm not hungry. What did I do? -What did I do to you? -Nothing. -Show me, please. -No, it's nothing. -Nothing at all. -Are you sure? Yes. I'm sorry. You want us to help you with the car? -Could you? -A little later. -I like poetry. -What? I like to write poems. Not read them. I cannot read. Just write. If you want me to, I can recite one for you. No need. "A kitchen without a lady's hand is like a ball without a band." "Gallant monarch of the forest, guess, prithee, who I love best?" "True love is sheer happiness. In my life I want no less..." Are you coming on to me? God forbid! How could I do that? -Why not? What's wrong with me? -You're saying that I should? No. You're not my type. But if you could, you would, right? I... With... You got me all befuddled. If you don't stop being so formal, I'll kick the hell out of you. -I am Doina. -Okay, I will. Doina... But... let's just go to the pen. There are wolves around here. I haven't seen such a thing. I need a phone signal, not your sheepfold. -There's no signal here? -We don't need such a thing. Don't look at me like that. I just followed the GPS. Did the GPS tell you to put on make-up while driving? The make-up's not to blame. That pothole in the road is. -Did you call a towing service? -There's no signal. -What do we do now? -These guys said they'd help us. -Awesome. -It looks like rain, again. Here, now it rains, now it's sunny. Now it's cold, now it's warm. -What's this? -You should have a bite before. -Before what? -You said you'd help us with the car. Yes, but you should eat something before... Before what? While you're eating, we pull the car out of the rut. -We pull it out quickly. -In a jiffy. We can... We know how to... If... You befuddled me. -We'll pull the car out of the rut. -As it were. Okay. -What about the keys? -What keys? To the car. How will you start it? Right you are. The keys... You take them. What are you doing? Try getting the car out of the rut. It's about to rain. You're not thinking at all? God gave us two women and you're fixing their car, so they can leave? -No? -No, man! We struck gold. We go to the car, we pretend to be tinkering some. Tell them it's hopeless. They'll stay here until nightfall. We cuddle up to them. We cajole them. Morning come, they're kissed for sure. -I'll have no part of it. -Why? I'm ashamed! They're not from our village. -So what? -What do you mean, so what? When will God send us again two women to smooch on Wool Day? -You're right, you know. -Unless he wakes up. -Who? -Bică. What if he wakes up? It's three of us and two of them! I'll go whack him. Stay put! You'll kill him! You whacked him to kingdom come. Plus he's gagged. If he wants to say something, it'll sound like a bleat. -Let's go tinker. -Okay, go. Push me! With zest! You go there. Now push! Harder! Push harder! -Man! Why are you pushing so hard? -You told me to! Not so forcefully! Do something to that engine! -Open it! -What? Pop it up! Did it pop? -Yank something from the battery. -The battery? Bro... this car's kaput. It's good for nothing now! I'm glad you feel like eating. Come on! -How goes it? -The car's kaput. -Busted. -What's wrong with it? -It's in bad need of repair. -But what's wrong with it? This is not an all-terrain vehicle, to bring it here. How do we leave this place? Do you have an ATV or something? What to do with it, here? A horse, a donkey, a bicycle, something! Our camp tender will be here... He can take you to the village. No way! Move! Come on! Come on! It cannot be... No! Calm... yes... calm. Try to forgive... my heart. In the name of love, be wise. Try to forgive... Please forgive, my heart. When you love, you must forgive. The rain's a'comin'. Why are you standing like a duck in a thunderstorm? Here! We'll walk. Chop-chop! Ella! -Where are we going? -In the village. All right? -There are wolves on the way! -Wolf's yo' momma. I said we go. Stop bitching. Doina, you're nervous and not thinking clearly. -You mean I'm stupid. -I just said "nervous". -Meaning "stupid". -If you insist... I can't believe you called me stupid. I shit all over your shitty documentary! You brought me to the end of nowhere to film some shitty peasants, with shitty traditions, selling a shitty wool. I'm not coming along! I'll sleep here and go to the village tomorrow, with whoever I can. -So you hit this fence by design. -Yes! I risked my life on purpose. So that you don't get to Răchiţele and make your documentary. -So you admit... -That's not the right mood. Lord, have mercy... See? That's why they want to fire your ass. 'Cause you always think everybody's up to get you. And wants to stop you from becoming the greatest documentarist on Earth. No, woman, nobody has it in for you. Your time has simply gone. If you think this documentary will undo this, think again. Nobody wants you anymore because you're just a tuned-up crone spending more time in "service" than in the editorial office. And if you've been given this task, if you are here now... it's only because I asked them to give you one more chance. I had your job in my pocket since the day I was hired. Don't stare at me like that. I didn't come here to film you. I came here to replace you. When they told me to, I pitied you. -Are you done? -Yes. Very well. Let's go. -What was that? -There he... -It started! It's clear as day. -What did start? The local revenant is claiming his rights. -A revenant? -Yeah. Legend has it that a handsome lad from our village kissed a beautiful lass, also from our village. On Wool Day. You know the old saying. Yes. If a man kisses you on Wool Day, he marries you. That's right. The lad kissed the girl and the girl didn't like it. Come nighttime, the girl ran away. He took revenge on her and killed her. Since then, he wants to take revenge on all the unkissed and unmarried girls. -Interesting. -Yup. He's a vengeful guy. Damned dog... Is this blood? -It's got blood on the muzzle? -Of course it does. He cut someone and fed him to the dogs. The dog ate him and got bloody. It means the ghoul's around. So he circles our pen. So all the unkissed and unmarried girls must stay with the unkissed and unmarried guys. Otherwise... woe them. Let's get the camera and stuff. We're shooting this. What?! You surely don't believe this cockamamie story. I do! Really! Come on! You'll see. Bro! Make a run to the shed and get Bică out. -You're coming with. -Why? -I'm kinda scared. -Why? The revenant! -Stop... -I made it up! Go whack him over the head and cover him with something. These ones are sure to go rummaging. Are you still here? -I'm afraid! -Man up! -I'm going! -Be a man! -Go already! -I'm going! What are you writing there? The best thing you did in your career was ramming the car in that fence. Right? We wouldn't have heard this Wool Day story in the village. This will be my best documentary. The last one... but the best. I'll teach the idiots in the office a lesson. Tuned-up crone, huh? -Who'll believe this wacky stuff? -You're so young... We don't want to persuade anybody there's a real ghoul here. Just to show that the locals believe in this. That they live their lives believing in revenants and things like that. Ticuţă! Tică! What happened? You've been taken ill? -It ate him, bro! -Who ate who? The dog ate Bică! It ate our brother! Are you stupid? I'm telling you! He was in the shed, on the chair, and now he's gone! -He went down to the village. -No! The dog ate him, I'm telling you. -Are you stupid? Go look for him. -Where, if the dog ate him? -Inside the dog? -Inside the dog! -What happened? -Nothing. The revenant frightened my little brother. You said he only takes revenge on the unmarried and unkissed girls. You cannot trust our local revenants. They're just like weather. -Rain, sunshine, rain... -Perfect! Ella! Let's take some shots for the atmosphere. Mountains, grazing sheep, the guys guarding them... And then we'll find a place for the interviews. -For what? -For you to tell me stories. -Listen... Go take that fur. -The sheepskin cloak? -Whatever. -Right away. Let's go in the woods! There are beautiful spots there. Follow me! -Come on! -Wait a minute. This is the spot. It's perfect! -Why? -Close to the pen... It's perfect. This is where we'll shoot. Ella, please put the camera over there. The woods are even finer a little down the road. No, this is where I like it. Yes. Good... Let me get ready. Ella! Please put his cloak on the ground, in the frame. Not like this! It's too elaborate. Go set the frame. I'll do it. It's gotta look like he dropped it on the ground. Like this! Did I startle you? Why where you so startled? Well... -Is Bică around? -He went... to... -He went down to the village, right? -No, God forbid! We talked to him. He only said it to ruffle your feathers. -Yes? -Of course! Where is he, then? He... went to the waterfall. To bathe. The weather is warm. -You're hiding something from me. -I'm not hiding anything! I swear! We can go to the waterfall, so you can see for yourself! I'll go later. I have other things to do. I sold all the wool. -Good for you! -I came to take another load. Of wool? How can I let you carry it? Better take a load off your feet! Did God take my legs away? I'll go fetch the wool. Relax! Cool down a little! Look how hot you are! You stayed in the sun! You're positively burning. Hold this. -Sit here boss, and cool down. -Horică... Put this on. The sun burnt your head through the hat. You wanna get sunstroked? -There... -Horică... Since you were a kid and your father first brought you here, I knew you were the one I could rely on. Of course you can. You're like a father to us. -We grew up under your very eyes. -Atta boy... Who's taking care of us? Who brings us bread and salami? -And clean clothes, and... -I do. -Just stay here and relax. -I'm staying! Wait, 'cause you're ruining... the surprise. -The surprise? -Yes. Stay here. -What surprise? -You don't know about it. You have a surprise for me? Horică, man... I'll just go bring it. Just sit still. All right? Will you? -I will. -You swear? -I'll do as you say. -You swear? Swear! Cross my heart. Horică! Did you leave? So you enter from here... running... Grab the cloak, throw it on your shoulders... When I say "action". Then run towards the sheepfold. Why not down the road? I can pick up more speed. You run towards the sheepfold. For the sake of the story. You grab the cloak. When I say "action", you run towards the pen. -From over there. -From where I'm standing right now. Perfect! -Where's your colleague? -He's feeding the dogs. -An American shot, please. -Pan, or you want him in the frame? No pan. When I say "action", you start running, yes? -Yes, I go from here... -Action! -I'm running? -Of course! I told you! Action! -I'm running! -Ticuţă! What is it? Wait a minute! Come here! -Minteoan just came back. -He asked about Bică? Yes, but I told him he was bathing at the waterfall. Go take care of Minteoan. If he sees these women, he'll take them to the village. And then we ruined their car for nothing. You understand? And we'll never see a woman around here again. Take care of it! And you... where are you taking them? -In the woods. Don't worry. -Are we shooting yet? -We are. Just wait a minute. -Listen... What if he's a ghoul now? -Who? -Bicuţă. What if the dog ate him and he turned into an evil spirit? Don't you have your head between your ears? A revenant must come back from the grave. Not from a slumber. I still fear him... Minteoan's the one to fear! Got it? -Yes. -Laugh! -Laugh, bro! -I can't. Go take care of it. And please let them all out! I told you! He never listens. -Where's my mike? -Here it is! -Go to your place! -Over there? I haven't got all day! When I say "action", you run! -So I'm running? -Action! I'm running! -Grab your coat first! -What coat? -The fur! Didn't we say so? -This is a cloak. Horică! Horică, is that you? Is the surprise ready? What surprise? Yes! Ready. Right away. The surprise... Hurry up. The fair will be over before you give me that surprise. -Come on, already! -In a jiffy. Be patient. What is this? The surprise? -Can you lounge on that fur? -Yes. Yes. Splendid. Listen... can you do a tight medium one? -Yes. It will do well. -Yes? Are you ready? -I am. -Okay. Ready? Action! Come on! Here, from this tree... the revenant hanged himself. After he hanged himself here... When he takes revenge on someone... He starts howling. He howls with tears of blood! Bitter tears! And he weeps and cries the name of the following person he'll take revenge on. And... Tică! -Tică! Man! -Bro! I've been looking for you forever. -What now? -Man... I tied him up. -Who? -Minteoan. -What do you mean you tied him up? -Wait... Did you get him? Run! What is it? Wait! Wait! -Come, Ticuţă! -I'm coming! -Who are you running from? -Did you shoot it? -I think so. I don't know what I got. -Let's see. Did you get him? See? I told you! -Where did he go? -Who? -Bică... The revenant. -You wanna go chase him? -Not me. Horică. -I'm not going. God forbid. -He'll eat me! -Come here... -Man! -What? -That's Bică. -Maybe, but he turned into a ghoul. Didn't you see he got a third eye, all red? We whacked him so many times, it's only normal! You go to him, wash him, fix him and take him to Minteoan. No way. I'm scared! You want to kiss a lass on Wool Day or not? -I do! -Then you go catch him. When I tell them you caught him, they'll be all over you. Got it? Go! Wait... -We didn't establish... -What? Which one do you fancy? The fresh one. -Which one's the fresh one? -The young one. I'm going. -Where is he going? -To lay his hands on the ghoul. Then he says a prayer and we're rid of him. -Okay, I'm... -No! Don't go! -I'm going. -No! The unkissed lasses must stay with the unkissed lads! All right... Ella, we got tension, mood, atmosphere... let's shoot some more. Shall I narrate some more? I got tension, too. Well? Yo! Horică! Come back here! My head hurts. -Yes! You fell. -Where? -You hurt yourself badly. -Me? To the head. You tumbled down the slope, hitting your head several times. -Me? -You! I'm astonished you're still alive. Come on! Lord... What the... What is this? Why did you get out of the shed, boss? Didn't I tell you to stay there 'cause you'd ruin the surprise? Now you went and ruined it! Is this the surprise? Yes! This is it! We got you a car. Surprise! But you had to stay in the shed because I didn't drive it too well. It slipped on the moist grass and I rammed it a little. I was supposed to fix it. I propped it in the fence. You propped it... it's all right. -But it's expensive! -No... Yes, it was. But we saved since we were kids, for you, 'cause you deserve it. You're taking care of us. Clean clothes, bread, salamis... That was the plan. He was to rile you about going into the village. He didn't really wanna! And us... Surprise! We bought you a car! You tell him! My head hurts. -Way to go, guys! Can I... -Yes, you can. But it's broken. -I'll make it run, don't worry. -Better try tomorrow morning. I'm dying... until tomorrow if I don't drive it. Look at that! Let me... Oh, my God... And the unmarried lasses must be around unmarried and unkissed lads, on Wool Day. Then the revenant is powerless. And if they kiss, he won't be able to attack them, either. He doesn't dare anymore. Is that all? Good! We're done. We got it. We're leaving. There are so many more beautiful things to see around here... That's just it. Come on. So you never kissed a girl on Wool Day so far? Never. Our camp tender is very mean. He doesn't let us go in the village for Wool Day. We have to stay up here with him and work. -What an ugly thing to do. -Yeah, he's ugly, too. -So you wouldn't wanna kiss? -The camp tender? No... A girl! Come on, already! What are you doing there? It's fine. -Wait! This is the tree! -What tree? Our tree! What's up with you? You got problems? There are wolves around! They started prowling! Can you hear them? Listen! I heard a car! Shut up! That was the wolf! It grunts and snuffles! Quick! Follow me! Keep close to me! Pay attention! Stay here! Wait for me here! I go solve the wolves problem. Come here! Pay attention to me! Stay right here! I'll go see where the wolves are. Don't move. You'll get lost. It's dangerous! Stay here and don't move! I'm gone! I'll be back! This guy has a problem. We got wolves now, too. I'm sorry! Bye-bye! Wait! Ticuţă's coming! Ticuţă! You missed an important moment! -What? -You missed the moment! -The moment? -Yeah. -When we gave Minteoan our present. -Our present... -The car! -The... car?! -Yes. -The car! Get here! -What? -You kissed me on the mouth? Don't you deserve it? My darling well-behaved lads! -What a surprise you had for me! -It's Wool Day. Wool Day, Schmwool Day. It's an old wives' tale. I go fetch another load of wool, get it to the fair. The way this day's been for me, I'll make you a great surprise tonight. Yo! I know. Yo' momma's present! I didn't know what to tell him about the car. Solve the car problem. I'm taking the girls to the waterfall and tell them the wolves are attacking. -In daytime? -Do they know the wolves' rules? Solve the car problem, come over there, and say you chased the wolves away with the dogs. Got it? What's the point? He kissed me on the mouth. What if I marry Minteoan? -You don't know? -What? -Minteoan doesn't count. -No? No. Solve the car problem. Hurry! The wolves! Run! The wolves are coming! Run, girl! That way! They're on the prowl! And they have a mean bite! Run! This one's in bad shape. Take him to the hospital. -Today? -Tomorrow. But don't be long. But the first "surprise", in the shed, was a joke, right? The car was the surprise, right? Yes! I was just joking. Of course. Well, that's it. Where is he going? Who took it? I saw you! Yo' momma's holy wafer! Give the car back! Follow me! Put your stuff down here. Come on! Let's go! Come into the water! You too! No? Come here! -We're staying here. -Why did you go into the water? -I don't know! -The wolves are coming! And they don't attack when you're in the water! Yeah? You plan for us to stay here until the wolves die of old age? Horică went to chase them away with the dogs. You're safe here, with me. Is this what your daily life is like? -Sometimes it's even worse. -You have such a hard life! We do! What? Are you cold? Let's get out! If the wolves come, we'll get back in! All right! What is it? Ticuţă! I made short work of them! I chased them all. Let's go then! I chased them! There's none left! Quickly! Come! Tică! Paprika... Potato hash... Roasted 'shrooms... Hot broth... Where is the towel, so I can wipe my mouth? But with a lamb! Like my mommy used to. Yo' momma's perch and girder... -Tică! -What is it? I brought the car back. I drove it. But I lost Bică again. Again. Did yo' momma drop you on yo' head when you were a tot? -No. -Go find him. -Quickly. Bring him back. -I'll go check again! Make haste! It's so cold here! Come here! It's now or never. The lasses are "seasoned". Had a good fright. Cold as a witch's tit. The time is ripe for us to cuddle up to them and smooch. Right? -Yeah. -Fetch a bit of palinka, quickly! Wait... I changed my mind. -Could I take the fresh one? -Why? She's very cold and frightened. She'll be easier to kiss. You take the old one. You're savvier. -We'll go as you said. -Palinka! Quickly! -What are you doing? -A salt ring. -Revenants fear salt. -Salt?! That's right! We know this from old! He won't touch salt. Shuns it like hell. Come on! Quickly! Huddle up! Come on! Don't dawdle! You, over here. You go there. That's it. Why did you make it so small? We're out of salt. He put it in the goulash. -And we'll sleep like that? -How else? 'Till morning. -He only comes at sunrise. -You mean we'll sleep standing? We'll sit on the cloak. Sit down, all of you! On the cloak! Don't step out of the circle! -How long have you been here? -Since we were kids. Our daddy brought us and left us here. I lost it! Do you have a pencil? -What? -A pencil. -What for? -A verse just hit me. When they cross my mind, I jot them down in my notebook. Tell it to me. I'll keep it in mind. You remember when you first heard about this ghoul? -I do. You want me to tell you? -I do. -Did you remember it? -What? -That verse. -The verse? Of course. -On the spot. -Really. -Let's hear it, then. -How shall I say... -It sounds better in my mind. -Come on, say it! No! Forget it. And then? I took them both under my arms, brought them here, I made a salt ring like this one and we sat like this 'til morning. -I'll whisper it in your ear. -Why? -I don't want Tică to hear. -Why not? He laughs at me. Okay. -And you got away? -No. We're dead. Green leaf, myrrh and frankincense, a fairy rammed into my fence. Quick as silver, never tame, goldilocks and tiny frame. Lord, if I could be her squire! 'Cause her lips are just like fire. If she could here a month to dwell, A wool coat I'd make for my belle. With tasty morsels I would seek her so that she would let me... -Kiss her! -Kiss her?! -Kiss her! -Kiss her! Kiss what, you jackass? I know what you wanted to say! -No! Kiss her! -My foot! I swear this was it! First, it was "I would miss her", to rhyme with "kiss her". But somehow I ended up with "seek her". It was a poem and I didn't say it right. Very well! -Kiss her! -Kiss her! Really, I... Sit down! There's no trifling with this revenant. Don't step out of the ring! It's dangerous. -What was that, now? -It sounded like gunfire. -Yes... It started. -What? The first bang. Then the second one... If you're not kissed by the third one... -What? -The ghoul! It's clear as day. -Go see what it was. -And the revenant? -Go! Are you dumb? -And that loud bang? -Go! I told you who he is! -Are you sure? Go! Look for more salt! -Where is he going? -Stay put! -I'm going with him! -Stay with us. It's dangerous. He'll manage. Will you manage? Here, you're with me. It's risky to step out of it. God in heavens, what are you doing here? Boss, you were supposed to be at the fair! -Boss! -An asshole... -The hatred and spite in him... -Who? I know who. He thought I was a half-wit and wouldn't realize who? -Can I... -He thought I'd sit idle? I saw him out of the corner of my eye, followed him... Took the bike and the rifle and got here. This is the only road he can take. To go to town, the only way is this stretch, by our sheep farm. When I arrived, the car was propped into the fence as if it never moved. I thought I'd choke with rage. I cocked the rifle... -And fired. -That was your gunshot? -Yes. -And you... Only got him in his leg. I didn't have my scope. I'd have plugged his butthole. Boss... Here's my two cents. I say we sit down and think... I go get my cigarettes from the car. It's risky! Swarming with ghouls. Sit down! Really? If he doesn't kill me, the nicotine crave will. So... I go kill him. The revenant? Isn't he already dead? He is! All he needs how is a stake through his heart. -Stay here! -Don't worry. He won't step into the salt ring. I'll be back. I'm quitting smoking. Minteoan! Man! Yo! Minteoan! -Shut up! -You scared the hell out of me! -You want him to kill me? Quiet! -Who? Minteoan! -Yes? -Yes! Now... He got... Horică now. And Horică took his rifle away, then Minteoan took it back. Now he wants to kill me for wanting to go down to the village. -Yeah? -Yes! Was I in the village? Was I? -Easy! -Bub! You've gone to the village! -You don't remember? -No. You came back and got into a big fight with Minteoan. Both Horică and I intervened. In your defense! But he whacked you good a couple of times with the sledgehammer. Then he said he'd shoot you. I thought he was kidding. He's not kidding for one second! Hush! He'll hear us! Come on! -Come! -Wait! -Wait, Tică! -What is it? -Did I get to kiss someone? -Where? -In the village. -Nope. Let's go. Do you know I have a picture of you? -Congratulations. -With an autograph. I was a freshman in high-school. You came for some news about pupils who were selling drugs. You know what you wrote on that picture? Now you'll tell me how I wrote something that determined you to become a journalist? You wrote: "Bst wishes, Doina Poenaru". "Bst wishes"? You were in a hurry and skipped the "e". You're right, in a way. You did inspire me to become a journalist. Well, not one like you. Is there a point to it, or you just want to rub me the wrong way? There is. The people at work want to get rid of you not because you're doing a bad job or you got old. But because your heart is not in it anymore. And you heard this from under our boss' desk. You're so... I was really trying to explain something to you. You think I don't know what you're doing? That you're filming these guys to make fun of them? Just another documentary showing how moronic some people are while you are so very smart. You used to portray people with real problems. Things that matter. Now you're just ridiculing simple folks. I just don't understand why! You stayed around me for one year for nothing. Instead of learning, you were too busy criticizing. You think you can put your heart in all you're doing, day by day, night by night? You know how it is to invest half a year into a documentary about the people living in the city's landfill? People without water, sanitation, IDs... They don't vote, they don't count. You promise them you'll tell their story and help them. Only to have your boss kill your material just because now there's another ruling party. You know how it is to antagonize a mayor and an entire city counsel because you wanted to expose contracts "with dedication"? And receive threatening messages each and every morning? To show them to your editor-in-chief... only to have him fire you. And then get home... where you hope to find some peace... And find your man with his bags packed... because he's sick and tired of living in your cesspool. Let me see you putting heart in all this shit. Me, I'm only interested in being paid and doing my job. Forgive me for not saving the world. But do you think it's fair to make fun of these people? You're jumping to conclusions? I'm not making fun of anybody. And this revenant story, even if I didn't believe it in the beginning, is worth documenting. With today's shooting... I really think I can make a fresh start. Do something again, and put my heart in it. Maybe we're here for a reason. Maybe this mystical area is my new direction. What are you doing? I'm taking the camera and we'll follow Tică. Listen... Will you get a few cigarettes, too? All right, I will. -Where are you taking me? -Hush! He'll see us! -Listen! I'll get you in here... -Where? Here. Don't worry. I'll get you in this hole. You'll stay crouched. Hidden. And I'll turn Minteoan back. When I know you're safe, I'll come and get you and we go to the police. -Fine. Wait! -What? -Man... -What is it? -You two are very good brothers. -We are. -Very good brothers. -We are. -Thank you. -All right. Stay put, man. Get in here, pronto. -Wait! -What now? -Would you bring me some water? -I will. Get down here! Get! Just burrow in there! Sit tight! -I love you! -All right! Horică! -I heard somebody shouting. -You're hearing things. Who could it be? The thief? "Here I am, Miteoan! Shoot me!" -It's you who shouted? -Yes. See? You think I'm nuts? What are you doing here? -You left all those sheep unattended? -No. Bică sees to them. What are you doing with this rifle? Somebody stole Minteoan's car, at the fair... -Quiet! -Somebody stole his car, and... Also came to the pen, to steal a few sheep. -Who? -I don't know. But Minteoan saw him and now we're looking for him. He shot him in the leg. We'll take him to the police. -Look no more. -Why not? What's it to you? Okay, look for him! I even think I saw him! -Where? -He was going downhill. -Limping, the poor guy. -That's him! -He must be! -Where did you see him? Go straight ahead... Go! You'll find him. Easy! Don't trip and fall! Take care! Stop yelling! I'll whack you with the rifle! -Where are you going? -This one shot Bică! Bică's the one he saw among the sheep. Bică was the shot one? Where is he now? -I hid him in the woods. -Listen... Shut up! He'll see we're having secrets. You brought me water... Ella! Set the camera here. Let's take a few shots with these woods. Forget about the woods! We'd better find Tică. You're in a hurry again? We'll find him, don't worry. Let's capture this beautiful, mysterious lighting. -Listen... -Yes. How about I shoot from left to right and then slowly upwards? I don't see what you mean. What was that? That was no revenant. That was the devil! I'll go look into it. Let's get back into the salt ring! Hurry! -What was it? -Nothing. It comes from that way! -No way. It comes from there. -It's the girls. You're right! This way! -You want your jacket? -Yes. It's so cold! Thanks. Man! You shot him! -Stay there! -You shot him! What do you mean I shot him? We heard two bangs so far, right? Oh, my... Bică! Is that you? Yes! -He shot you again? -What? -He shot you again? -What? No! Yes, he did. Stay there! Until I come back. -Yes. Man! Water! -Bring him some water. Burrow yourself in there! Camouflage yourself! I love you, guys! Which one would you kiss? In order to save yourself? After what I saw in the woods, I'd even kiss the dog. And what if we marry them? I don't know. We are to sit inside the ring, right? If we sit in the ring, we're protected. Yeah, we'll sit inside the ring. -How is it? -He's dead. -Dead! I want to see him. -Don't! He's shot in the head. His brains are all over the place. I didn't want to! I didn't want to! -Man... Relax. Calm down. -How did I... Minteoan! Hush! I'll tell you what to do. You go in the village pub, you drink and raise hell. So that everybody knows you were there. And then shout as loud as you can that you're going home. So that you have an "alibibi". And we'll bury him here. Not even the Good Lord will get wind of it. I didn't want to! Minteoan! Calm down! In the morning, you show up. As if nothing happened. All right? Go! Quickly. -What did I do? -You didn't do anything. Go! What did I do? I didn't want to! Minteoan! You killed him. So? We all die someday. Go! -I didn't want to! -Don't let him get to the pen. -Give me the rifle. -Take it! Go! -Man! -What? -What does that "alibibi" mean? -None of your business. Go bring some water for this one! How about we kiss each other? Me and you? -We better sit in the ring. -Better inside the ring, yeah. He went away. Thank God. The lasses are frightened as hell. Primed for kissing. We're back in business. But what will we tell Minteoan about the girls' car? Does it matter, when we've kissed women before daybreak? Rich women, from Bucharest! Listen... Hurry to the shed. Then you come back, very sorry that there's no more salt. -Salt and what else? -Nothing else. There was something else. Salt and something. Yes! That. Go! -The revenant had the better of me! -The revenant?! -Yes! -We're not rid of him yet? No... He's a mean son of a bitch. I looked for salt everywhere! There's not a single grain! -What's to be done? -Get into the ring. Quickly. -Your shoulder hurts? -Yes. -What are you doing? -What am I doing? -I know what you're doing. Stop it! -Stop me. You laid your eyes on mine! Yes! Better with this one, who's fighting revenants, than this nincompoop who looks for salt for half an hour and comes back empty-handed. Stop it! He's mine! It's me he held in his arms all day! Yes? We'll see. My shoulder seems to hurt a little, too. If you could... You're fine. Let Doina give you a massage. -Anyone. Doina! You, Doina! -You're worsening his pain. A dislocated shoulder must be put back, not massaged. You're right. Let's see... Doina! You, Doina! Bicuţă! -That's... -He looks like... -This is our little brother... -The revenant we filmed. What do you mean, filmed! He's not an actor! Ella... Check on the camera. -Only if... -Water... -What? -Water... That's what I was supposed to remember! Salt and water! -There were two things! -Well... This is our kid brother. The sickly one. Our daddy wanted to feed him to the wolves. We brought him here and we're taking care of him. Doina... Come see this. Replay this shot. -Minteoan just came back. -He asked about Bică? Yes, but I told him he was bathing at the waterfall. Go take care of Minteoan. If he sees these women, he'll take them to the village. And then we ruined their car for nothing. And we'll never see a woman around here again, to kiss. -Where are you taking them? -In the woods. Leontina, is that you? God! Let's tell them the truth, while we still can. Didn't I tell them he's our brother? And that daddy wanted to feed him to the wolves?! Let's tell them the truth! You only got us into a shitload of trouble. Since they came here... Well... Yes! It might be just an old wives' tale... And this might have been just a chance encounter. But I don't know why here in Răchiţele, the couple who kisses on Wool Day gets hitched. Isn't that my surprise? Boss... -What? -Way to go, Bicuţă. I'm glad that you, at least, did it. Translation by: Dan Balica
