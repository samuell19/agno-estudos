If you sit over there… Today is… August 2nd, 2022. August 2nd. When did you start planning this project, this album? - The beginning of this project? - Yes. What Zeus had kept inside the box broke loose from their confinement. All that was foul was now unleashed upon the world. Pandora, unable to undo what she had done, fell into despair. As she grieved, she heard a feeble quiver from the box. She lifted the lid once more, and out fluttered a small, bright, most beautiful creature she had ever seen. It flapped its delicate wings as it danced around Pandora, lightly brushing against her shoulder. Pandora immediately felt her angst melt away and her heart glow with warmth. It was hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box. It trailed behind the miasma of darkness, assuaging their ill-effects on humankind. Hope gave people the will to carry on living amidst the pain and strife. This version has a completely different mood. I, for one, can definitely picture it. - Really? - Yes, definitely. I actually don't think the two versions are all that different either. If this were your solo concert, you'd be able to do whatever you want. "This is part of who I am, who j-hope is." "I can also do mature stuff like this." That's what I wanted this album to focus on. I believe the set list should represent who I am. That was the idea behind it. But I'm also aware I can't just do all that I want. It's such a huge festival. I need to have the audience in mind. At the same time, it needs to be in line with who I am. - I'd love to discuss it with you all. - Okay, then… But also, you don't want to have any regrets later on. That's the thing. I thought you… - But maybe I've been selfish. - That's what I… I'm stressed out. Gosh, this isn't easy. Maybe I bit off more than I could chew. It was about half a year after Hope World dropped that the thought hit me. "This is what I'm going to do next." With Hope World, I was still inside the box. I always wondered if that was who I really was. I'm not saying that wasn't me. That's part of who I am. But at the same time, it felt like it was time to show a maturer side of me. I thought, when I finally pop out of the box, I want to sing about my experiences outside the box. Bang Sihyuk called me the other day. He said, "I'll stay on the sidelines this time. Will you be all right?" I told him I wanted to show him what I'd always wanted to do. That I wanted to work on it myself and show it to him when it's done. I'm in charge of everything for the first time. I have to decide what's good and what's not and what I need to do. I need to pay attention to every little detail. I've been having trouble falling asleep at night. But I'm definitely having fun. I love what I do. This is my chance to grow as an artist. But that doesn't mean it's easy. People don't know about this. They know BTS very well, but they don't know how j-hope of BTS makes his music, what steps he takes to create his albums and performances, or how the promotion works. I wanted to show these things in depth. I want every detail to go on record. I've been filming myself as well. I've been working on a song. I listen to the recording every day to see how it sounds. So far, I haven't gotten any feedback. Which means it wasn't good. This is bad. I don't know what to do. ♪ Someone's light, someone's smile Someone's hope ♪ ♪ The things I do are someone's life ♪ ♪ Time goes by like the name says Someone's star ♪ ♪ Mottos and vibes are created As my soul becomes refined ♪ I feel like I must release this album. ♪ To my passion, burn To my hopes, burn ♪ ♪ My life, burn Every day I ran ♪ ♪ Couldn't stop Back then ♪ ♪ I burned it all, and I wanted it all ♪ I think this album will serve as an important stepping stone that leads me to my next chapter.

The latter part of this album talks about the troubles I'm going through these days and the problems I need to solve at this moment. That's what these songs are about. This is pretty much how I feel these days. That's how this song called "Arson," came to be. Ahh... Gosh, I'm beat. I'm so exhausted. Dad's in Seoul? Really? I guess I won't be able to see him this time. I think I have to stay at the studio today. Yes, I'm at the studio. Yes, I'm working on it. All right. Sorry. I'd love to go home, have good food, and crash out. This is annoying. This is how you end up in a rut. You suddenly lose all interest. You don't know why you're even doing this. To be absolutely frank, there's no reason for me to push myself this hard. But I guess this is just who I am. I could take it easy and have fun if I wanted to. I could be as lazy as I want. But I don't want that. As a result, I'm stressed out. Let's go. The title of the album is Jack In the Box. It refers to a toy where a clown springs out of a box. Until now, I've been making music and giving out messages from inside the box. But I've come out of the box now. I've come out into the bigger world. I want to talk about what I feel now that I'm outside the box. I've also come a long way as a musician. I want to showcase the kind of music that I've encountered out in the world. That's the idea behind this album. Whenever I make music, Namjoon is the first person I play it to. He told me that this album sounded very new and interesting. That it's completely different from what I've been doing. He also loved the fact that I integrated the hooks from the old days into this new album. He gave a really positive review. I'd like the other members to have a listen too. BTS as a team is on hiatus, and each member is doing his own thing. But I don't feel much of a difference. Except that I've moved to a different place. That's pretty much it. I still feel like I'm a member of a team. How does each member of BTS live their own life? I truly devoted the entirety of my 20s to BTS. But nothing lasts forever. I feel like I need to experience something new to be able to appreciate what I have now. I'm sure this will bring us together as a team. Father. Good to see you. - Mickey. - Hi. - Mom. - Hey there. - Mom. - Hey there. Mickey. How have you been? How are you, my old man? Calm down, Gramps. There's a stone I want to show you. My parents' big surprise for me. HOPE WORLD Father, Hope World? Hmm? This is amazing. I see a few new rocks, Dad. Whenever I'm here, I sleep in the same room. These stairs are lined with photos of me and my sister. I feel my parents' love. This is where I sleep. You can also see my father's collection here. I cleaned them. You did? Good job. They look nice. I cleaned them all. Drink up. There's so much stuff I need to give you. Is there a lot of new stuff? You bet. Magazines… - You should update the collection here. - All right. Everything I have is pretty old. The old stuff is good, I admit. I'm not throwing any of it away. Everything stays. I'll find more space. - The older, the better. - Of course. I'd love to go inside the school. ILGOK MIDDLE SCHOOL Was there a stationery store here? I used to play games in that back alley. The bungeoppang stand I used to go to is still here. Unbelievable. My love for dance began in elementary school. Going up on stage at a talent show while at a retreat… This is nice. This is fun. The pictures from the bamboo forest didn't turn out well. Did you sleep well? I did. Dig in. This is so good. I'm having breakfast for the first time in forever. I think I'd finally put on some weight if I stayed here for a month. Right? If any of the members need to put on weight, send them here. I guess you're the only one. But you'd never stay here that long. - You'd sneak out. - Right. - I'd walk all the way to Seoul. - Exactly. It's funny to think I was born and raised in Gwangju. Right. All I do is talk about Seoul. You've lived there for many years now. I got another wart. - You got what? - A wart. - A wart? - Cut it off. I'll do it tomorrow. Otherwise, it'll bother me when I practice for the concert. It looked like this after the shot. I'm showing you at the table. Is Jung Kook awake? He is. I bet he stayed up all night. Jimin and Jung Kook always do. I don't know how they do that. Aren't they tired? They're younger than you. They're just a couple of years younger than me. Three at most. You leaving? You want to say goodbye? Because I'm leaving? I love you. Stay healthy. I had so much good food and much-needed rest. Once I'm back in Seoul, I'll be busy with meetings and whatnot. I'll be back to being j-hope. Let's go be j-hope. Keep turning. - It won't come out. - It will. Gosh. The preparation for the promotion has started. Starting with the listening party, there are many things to do. This is a photo booth. Isn't this the café? - It is. - It's the café so it has to stay. - I like it this way. - Right. I'm not sure. It doesn't have to be big at all. Okay, that's big. I didn't realize how cool our building was. It'll be extremely hectic. - There will be so many people. - I know. I just want to confirm one thing. It'd be great if we could have a DJ booth over there. After my song, I'll casually walk over here, greet the guests, and take off. I won't say anything. I'll just take off. Like a fashion show. Once people have a few drinks… and start enjoying themselves… Gosh. People will show up, right? 100 guests are out of the question. Right. The problem is, - you'll have to act as the host. - Right. Exactly. I have zero experience though. Today I'm here to try out the food and drinks that will be served at the party. There's a square like a jack-in-the-box. Look at these too. They're checkered. Are these hamburgers? - Yes. Let me explain… - J-HOPE: That's so cool. - It goes well with the theme. - I know. It fits the theme perfectly. There's a problem. I'm not done with the arrangement and choreography yet. I can't sleep at night. Hey! I'm trying out the food. It smells so nice. What is this? It looks expensive. Do you want some? - No, I have a wedding to attend. - Do you? - They go well together. - What do you think? Try everything first. It's perfect. I barely got any sleep. We're going to play music videos at the listening party. I stayed up all night finalizing them. I slept for two hours. I hadn't slept this deeply in a while. I have to contact the artists one by one. I also have to post something on Instagram. This is driving me crazy. I'll have to tackle them one at a time. But it's fun. I'm having fun. I dropped a little something yesterday on IU's Palette. You know how you scoop out ice cream… I dropped one scoop of ice cream yesterday. We're one scoop in now. After today, there will be another scoop on top in another flavor. The album release will be the third scoop… …and Lollapalooza, the fourth. Then I'll have a delicious ice cream cone. You don't often see listening parties. They seem to be more common overseas. When you release music, it deserves a celebration. And it should be enjoyed with others. I wanted to show that idea and be seen as well. No matter which part… Regardless of whether we're close… With politics aside… Those things don't matter. Music is supposed to… connect everyone, and be used as a means to communicate, a tool to bring people together. I wanted to remind everyone of that. There were many things that I wanted to change. That's why I'm doing this. ♪ We're in the smart world now But not smart, for the most part ♪ ♪ Rage-filled talks, not face to face ♪ D-day. Hello! Hi. Who are you? Who are you? What are you doing here? You can do this, right? Yes. The doors are opening. Let's do this! Let's get it! Can you play it? Is that okay? Why is the sound so shallow? Where's the champagne? One, two, three. The sound quality isn't so good. So many people came to my party today. All the artists, people from the dance scene where I originally come from, actors, and celebrities. I'm so honored. Greeting each and every one of them was really fun. I wish I'd done this sooner. All right. Here we go. Hello, I'm j-hope of BTS. To me, it feels like I'm putting myself out there. It's time to open the box. Open the box. Let's go! J-hope! - Is this the title song? - Yes. J-hope! Thank you so much for listening. I couldn't help but notice all the things that could've been done better, but I'd like to thank you again for listening. We have our DJ right here. My soul friend, Lockfly, came today... and will be pumping up our party tonight as our DJ. I hope you all have a great time. Thank you. J-hope! What now? We party! Let's go! Great work! Thank you so much. You did an amazing job. - Thank you. I'll call you. - All right. - Great work. - Great work. - Yo, let's go. - Okay. Let's go. Good work. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Great work. Thank you so much for your hard work. Good work. Thank you so much. Great work, guys. I'm honored beyond words. So many people came and celebrated with me. It's so… I don't know what to say. This is such a meaningful moment for me. This will be remembered as an important milestone in my career. With this, I'm also done with another big chunk of the promotion. Like I said earlier… IU's Palette, check. Listening party, check. Two scoops of ice cream are ready. Anyway, there's more on the way. Following the listening party, I have the V Live tomorrow. And of course, Lollapalooza. There's so much to do, and there's so much I want to show you. Please look forward to it.

I'll do my best. We'll start with "More." Before the performance begins, we'll put the question, "More?" up on the screen. What Zeus had kept inside the box broke loose from their confinement. It flapped its delicate wings… I had only ever performed as a member of BTS. I'd never once performed solo. This is my debut performance as a solo artist. So is it really okay for me to be a headliner for such a big festival? That kind of thing really scared me. But I decided to aim high. I was confident that the music I was releasing this time could get through to the audience. I felt I could proudly put it out there.

How are you feeling tonight? You all good? Do you guys want more? Okay, play this shit. Let's go. Now, it feels like I'm in Chicago. Should we go down? Shall we get on a boat? Where should we go? I don't want to go back yet. Yes! j-hope right here! Was it 2018 or 2019? Jimin and I came here to shop. We went on a shopping spree. It feels so weird to be back. Is there anyone who can't eat oysters? Can you? We didn't order too much, did we? I don't like wasting food. This reminds me of the drink I had at my listening party. The drink named More. Let's share it. Enjoy. You do it like this. Shit. That's too much. Eat up. I'm on my way to the first band rehearsal. Time flies. The festival starts tomorrow. Okay. - About the videos we'll be playing… - MAN: Yes. Can I take a look? Sure. Later… - I'd love to take a look. - I'll tell you when you can. Why does this place feel familiar? I think we've been here before. We have, right? It feels so familiar. I just didn't recognize the exterior. Were we here on the Red Bullet Tour? It was a Red Bullet concert. And now I'm rehearsing here. Wow. I've come a long way. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Hello. I'm so sweaty. I'm sorry. - Show him. - Okay. Have a look. No, show him the rehearsal first. They're not coming together. I don't see any chemistry among the dancers. "Hey." I don't see much interaction going on. I should've checked in advance. - I think I get what you mean. - Okay. Yesterday was the first day, and the chemistry is building up. By the time you perform, I don't think it'll be a problem. Instead… He's our bandmaster. He arranged all the songs. Wow. Good to meet you. Jackson, j-hope. I'm j-hope. - We have the bass. - Oh, yes. Matt. Nice to meet you. The drums. What's going on, man? Okay. All together. Why does it sound like my voice is peaking? - It sounded okay. - Should we turn it up a little? ♪ We've got each other Our sights set together ♪ ♪ No one person above another No one person below another ♪ ♪ Let's roll ♪ That's too loud.

We'll continue rehearsal at 3 p.m. Thank you. You were amazing. Okay. Namjoon texted me early this morning. "Hang in there, j-hope." I sent him a recording of the noises I hear from my room, saying, "Can you believe this?" He replied, "Hang in there, j-hope." I mean… The noise level was unheard of. And I'm not even that sensitive. Seriously… This is uncomfortable. Is there a chair? Will this be better? Do you want to sit here? That was good. All right then… This is where you speak to the audience. You don't have to do it now. - Let's take five. - Yes. - Let's catch our breath. Our dancers too. - Okay. - Can I go up here? - Yes, just not to the other side. I'm giving my debut solo performance as a headliner for Lollapalooza. Damn. Life is fascinating, isn't it? It's been about 17 years… since I decided to dance and pursue this path. I've always been trying things out, diving head first, doing music, and learning from the people around me. I never imagined I'd rap. But I just gave it a try. I don't think I'm afraid of… learning new things. I've been able to stay on this path because I enjoy it. It's been fun. That's important. About 70,000 people?

Me too. - Is that okay? - Yes. - We don't mind. - It's okay. Sorry, no pictures. Why am I even in the picture? But this time, I felt like I had to. - I think… - Your face was covered. They wanted a picture with him, so what was I doing there? - What? - J-hope looks happier since you came. Seriously. I was looking awful. - Get it together. - Whatever. Let's go. - Okay, let's go. - I'll be behind you. Come on. Come with me. Of course. Your role model. Role model. Jimin. Is that him? So honored to meet you. Brother. What's up, man? - How are you feeling? - You're my muse. I appreciate that. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm… - Did you perform? - Yeah, I'm performing tomorrow. Tomorrow? I loved your mixtape, Friday Night Lights. Wow, man. "Higher" is my favorite music. That's crazy. "Higher"? You love the song, "Higher"? You hear it? He was just asking… That's my friend and my business partner. He was asking, "I wonder, what's the song?" Thank you, man. I appreciate that. - Can we take a photo? - Of course. Come on. Ayy! I'm so happy! This is awesome! He's so excited. - Hey. - Yes? - I'm proud of you. - Why? Gosh. I thought my heart was going to explode. I'm happy if you're happy. - Bye. See you later. - Okay. - Enjoy your dinner. Call me. - Okay. Get some sleep. If you can't sleep, come to my room. Okay. - Bye. - Thank you for today. While we were drinking, someone said, "Shouldn't you do one BTS song?" But I wasn't sure. All the songs are in Korean. They might feel foreign to the audience. Let's say I do "Dynamite." What am I supposed to do? Sing my part only? You'll need a new version. I can't put the song in the middle of the set list. Or in the beginning. Then it won't feel like it's my performance anymore. It is definitely a symbolic song. I'm not sure… if it's okay for me to change it. This is tricky. Slowly. Okay. Good. One minute to go. ♪ Cos ah ah I'm in the stars tonight ♪ ♪ So watch me bring the fire ♪ ♪ And set the night alight ♪ Hi, Lolla. You know this, right? I'm going to dance, so you guys sing.

I thought I'd just be one of the artists that perform. I'm well prepared. I'm not worried about that. I just hate the nervous feeling before the performance. I'll be fine after doing a few songs, but I always feel nervous before going on stage. It was the same when performing as BTS. Hi. Hello. ♪ My character's half and half Who knows? ♪ ♪ Doing my best As a public figure, who knows? ♪ ♪ Trying not to be greedy, who knows? ♪ ♪ Always out of breath daydreaming Who knows… ♪ It's going to be fun. ♪ Want to party like crazy, I know ♪ ♪ Want to fall in love, I know ♪ ♪ Yeah, I know, I know, I know ♪ It'll be fine if I can perform as usual. But as the performance draws near, I'll be so nervous and anxious that my face turns pale. So they're foreign dancers? It's super cool. It's hardest before going on stage. - Your facial muscles ache. - I know. You're so nervous that your cheeks ache. You can't hear anything when you're nervous, right? Right. - No matter what I say… - I tune everything out. That's right. I thought this was the sea. But it's just a huge lake. I'm pretty sure we talked about this last time too. I bet we did. I think I said it. The rehearsal was pretty exhausting. This is bad. Is he going to perform over there? There's an airplane for you in the sky. - What? - There's an airplane. - What airplane? - It has your name on it. If I do something in the future, you have to come. Of course, I will. You know what I'm going to do? I won't be in the US. Perform at the BBMA. No, I'm going hiking in Alaska. I'm going to shoot Run BTS. Gosh. Are you just saying whatever comes to your mind? I definitely feel more relaxed with my friends around. - Really? - You know… I now understand artists who bring their friends along when they perform. - I was wondering if I should go out. - I get them now. - Why? - If I should leave him alone. - Why? - Because he's on edge. No, you're helping me relax. - Becky! - Hi! - How are you? - How have you been? How are you? Hey. Good to see you, Becky. Are you so excited? I'm super pumped up. Okay. Your heart's pumping… - You got the good vibes… - Yes. - I'm ready. - Are you ready? Oh, yes. I'm going to ask her a question after our performance together. Yes, I've got that. I've got you. - I've got you. - Perfect. Remember, I remember we may not speak the same languages, but we do speak the same language - of music. So… - WOMAN: Of music, right. …we got this. We got this. We're gonna kill it. - We love you, Hobi! - We love you, Hobi! Jeong Hoseok! Jeong Hoseok! Hobipalooza! Hobipalooza! J-hope! j-hope! With Jimin? - Break a leg. - Let's go.

It's been two days. Yesterday, I couldn't believe that it actually happened. It didn't feel real at all. But when I woke up this morning, my body ached all over. That's when I realized that I really gave it my all. I finally started eating again after the performance. I can finally eat now. I couldn't believe it. I was very worried because this was the first time. Usually, I get energy from the other members. We also create a synergy effect. But this time, I had to create all the energy myself. I felt really burdened. The worry was really weighing on my mind. Now? I feel relieved. What I loved the most was… the scream. Awesome. You made it! Let's hear it, man. Hey. Thank you so much. It was so good. - It was awesome! - Great job! Becky! It was crazy. So good. - I'll wear these to match you. - Oh, yes. Three. One, two, three. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Great work. - Time flew. - Really? It's all thanks to you. Thank you. I couldn't sleep last night. Really? - You did amazing. - I did? - It's all thanks to you. - No. - We worked so hard. - We did. I was so worried. When the band arrangement was delayed… I knew you'd pull it off. I'm so relieved everything went well. - Great work. - Thank you. Gosh. I'll never be able to forget this thrill. After the morning rehearsal, I thought, "If I perform with this much energy, I'll lose my voice halfway through." I was panicking. And I could only shake off that fear thanks to Jimin. Seeing him goof around as usual, I could forget that fear. You were a huge help. - I'm your fan today. - Really? You were amazing. Like I texted you, you were such a big help. - Are you feeling relieved? - It's a huge weight off my shoulders. J-hope! j-hope! You look… You look handsome today. Why is that? What happened? I love having a friend to laugh and chat with. What's funny is, we can be doing this because everything went well. Imagine I'd messed up. I'd be so depressed. I'd be holed up in my room. Although I would've had to come to New York anyway to catch the flight. But I would've holed myself up. What kind of vibes I have… What kind of music I do… What kind of person I am… I wanted to show it to everyone. And I think I successfully put it out there. It was one heck of an experience. I've been promoting my album, Jack In The Box, for about a month and a half now. And the final step awaits me when I get back. Once that's done, the entire promotion will come to an end. What's next? Whatever goals, dreams, and hopes you have… keep you going, I think. On that note, I'll sing a song that holds a personal meaning for me. This next song is dedicated to all of our futures.

But I hadn't started planning anything specific until 2020. It was between 2019 and 2020. It's not like I planned to do this, but it all happened like destiny. And this is where I am now. ♪ Future ♪ Okay, guys. Please give it up for the band. Clemons on drums. Music Director Asaf on bass. Jackson on guitar. Carrice on keys. Okay, special thanks to our bassist, Matt. So, thank you so much, friends. Okay, finally, a huge shoutout to the beautiful dance crew! Hey! Thank you, my fellas. Chicago, make some noise! Thank you, Chicago! Thank you, Lolla! Thank you, ARMY! Good night. I'm about 94 percent done with all the plans that I had made. The final step won't be as huge as Lollapalooza, but I think it'll be a nice present for the fans. When my album had just been released, many things worried me. "Shouldn't there be more promotion efforts?" "Why aren't you dancing?" That kind of feedback did bother me. So I was quite anxious. But now that I look back, the fans seem to love it, and the project seems to have been a success. I think it'll soon be time to say goodbye to Jack In The Box. But only to come back as a better artist. J Hope In The Box focused on showing j-hope as a person. On Hope On The Street, I'll be going back to my roots. I started out as a dancer. For me, everything started from there. So I'd like a chance to look back on that.
