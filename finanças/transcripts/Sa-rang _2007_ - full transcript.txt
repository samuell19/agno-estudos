He lives in the hood and does coin tricks for money at nights. The gang's in town are scouting him but he's so crazy stupid, they gave up. I can't breathe. See 'ya later. Shit!

Well, my mama works at a bathhouse. I got a match next month. I'm fucked. Emergency Hospital What day is it, today? Monday. Aren't 'ya going to school? Got expelled last week for dumpin' glue all over class. Hey, Boo? When you get out of here, wanna come over to my pad? - $3! Only $3. - I fought with the thugs in Wan-wol. Got hit by coke bottle. Really? What'd they want you for? See you again, boys. For some shitty crap... Did they come for money, again? Who's that? Sister. What's with her not talkin'? Shit. Hey, did you ever live in Shin-sun dong? Why? Did you live there, too? I'm so sorry, kid. It's okay, ma'am. This is how we live. You understand, right? Yes, ma'am. Smoke one. No, ma'am. I'll smoke it later with Sang-woo. Fine. - In-ho, was it? - Yes. I don't know what to say to you... Such a handsome boy... Hey, mom. Boo can't smoke that, if you're here. Get out. Fine. I'll go after I smoke this. In-ho? My boy's got no manners. You understand, right? Stop yappin' and go! I will! I'm almost done. Get out. Bastard... Fine! I'll go. You bitch! I said get out!

Bond killed his mama and he's in the hospital! - When? - Last night! He taped himself to her and threw oil and fire on 'em! Emergency Boo! I'm so hot! Water... He'll die if he drinks. What did the docs say? Doesn't look good. In-ho? There's no need for you to stay. I should be here for my friend. Friend? My brother? You weren't that close. He even put you in the hospital. That's how we got close. I'm such a bad girl. Why? A part of me feels relieved. I think I kinda understand... When my dad left home, I kinda felt the same thing. You do the rest. Your remains are mixed together. So please get along well in heaven. What was that? I threw them a coin on their way. So if they had anything left to say, they can use it to make a call. I was thinking... You should be more careful at a time like this. I should keep watch on you. It's the least I can do for Sang-woo. Don't worry. I'm staying with a girl that I work with at the school's office. Oh... I see... In-ho? Wanna... get a drink? The whole family, together. All of us together. Together. Kentucky Chicken Here. When we met that day... Did you know it was me? Uh-huh... You remembered? Of course, In-ho Chae. I remembered you, too. Mi-ju Jung. Hey, Mi-ju? Can I look after you? For what? No reason. Why? Because you feel sorry for me? Or... Because I look lonely? Because... I'm all alone in the world, now? Is that why? Yah... Fine. Great. In-ho Chae. You look after me. I'll look after you, too. You mean it? Of course. Promise me! On a test out of 100... You got 5! A dog can do better than this! Stick 'em in. Who's absent today? They're gone to Judo practice, sir. Those kids are always missing class! They'll have rocks in their heads. If I catch you not studying on your day off tomorrow, You know what I'll do! You'll get 100 shots! Of what? The rubber band of love. She's a pretty good cook. Of course she is. To be honest, I couldn't recognize her at all. Man, I feel bad. She's working today and she still packed us, lunch. Chill, man. Enjoy your break from training. Anyway... Did you do it? Do what? You know, the bam-bam. You sick, bastard! You crazy? It's just a question. Relax, man! No more food for you. Aw, man! Fine! Be like that! You go on ahead. I need to use the john. - You crazy! - Run! Help me! I kicked it hard but didn't think it'd go over. You don't think he'll die in the shit, do you? Shut up! You could get me in shit, too! Yo, Nol-bu. Hello, sir. What 'ya doin' here? My friend lives around here, sir. He your bud? Say hi, In-ho. This is boss Chi-kwon. Smart looking kid. - Nol-bu? - Yes, sir. Do you know Sang-woo, the kid who died, recently? Yes, sir. He's got a sister living around here. Know where she is? No, sir. Fine. I'll find her anyway. - Go on. - Yes, sir. The fuck you staring at? Let's go. Who's that? Chi-kwon. His older brother is the boss of the Devils. He's a gangster? I heard Sang-woo's mom borrowed a lot of money from them. So? He's making Mi-ju pay? That's probably why he's out for her. In-ho Chae. Remember what you said when you first got in here? I said, I wanted to help my mom, and go to college on judo, sir. So? Tomorrow's the big match! You have to get into the semi-finals! Smarten' up! Crazy kid! Wanna get killed! Follow that car, mister! Looks like you're getting a fresh one, tonight boss. Can't tell unless I try her first. She's a lot heavier than she looks, boss. Give her a shot and wake her. I ain't eatin' no dead beat. Yes, sir. You know who you're dealing with? He's been in jail 3 times! It doesn't matter. You're with me, right? Aw... man... How pretty... I love you. You owe me 100 times. Got that? You bitch! How did you know I like that? Let's rock. You bitch! Who's there? Who is it! What is it? Says the boss sent him for you, sir. Claims there's a fight at the docks, sir. What? With who? Don't know, sir. But the boss ran out with the others. Shit. I didn't hear of no fight... Who are you? Hello, sir. I met you the other day with Nol-bu. I'm In-ho. I just came into the gang, yesterday. Damn! A flat tire! You! Fix the tire then come to the docks. Yes, sir. Let's go. I'll be right there, sir. What the fuck... - You go to school with Nol-bu? - Yes, sir. Do you know a kid called Boo? Heard he's the bitch's boyfriend. If you see him, tell him I ate one off his girl. I'm Boo! You fuckin' bastard! In-ho! In-ho! What happened? You killed him? Don't know. Fuck! We're in deep shit. Mi-ju? Mi-ju? That bastard. Nol-bu? Get me two tickets to anywhere far. You sure you won't regret this? I promised I'd look after her. Fine. Shit! They're here! Shit! They must've called home. Mom caught be stealing money so I told her I had to go to Seoul. What's this? Take Mi-ju that way and run to the police. What? Go, Nol-bu! - Are you crazy? - Run! Shit. What are you looking for? Boo's right here! Ah... Mrs. Chae? Stupid. How can you smile? Coach said the same thing. Have a seat. I'm sorry. No, I'm the one who's sorry for not protecting you. But you did protect me. I'll never ever forget you. Hey, you sound like you're going far away or something. Listen to me. I'll testify at your next trial. Don't hide what he did to me. Your chances are a lot better that way. No! Come on! That's not the problem, here! It is to me! I'm going to my dad in Japan after the trial. I won't be here... So... It won't matter what people think... How long will you be there? Not sure... Will you write? Will you come to see me? Yes... I'll come... To see you... Promise me. I promise. You'll keep it, right? Of course, I will. I... love you more than anything. But do you? Yes... I love you too, In-ho. More than anything. That'll do. I can survive anything on that. Mi-ju... Do you know when I started loving you? The day you invited me to your birthday. I dreamed of growing up and getting married to you. When I saw the creditors hounding at your house... I was angry 'cuz there was nothing I could do. And when I couldn't see you again... I was so sad and heartbroken... They say I'm stupid for doing what I did for a girl I haven't known very long. And Chi-kwon's men in here sometimes bully up on me. But I fight against 'em all and never regret keeping my promise. 'Cuz Boo's responsible for Boo's destiny. Mi-ju... My 100th letter to you came back. Is something wrong? Did you forget me? You stand with your back turned in my dreams these days... I cry awake at night and don't know if it's real or just a dream. Sometimes I forget why I'm in here. My poor boy... Mi-ju... Where are you? I work with Nol-bu at the docks. I'm not making much yet. But I'll save enough money to go and find you. So please wait for me, Mi-ju. I'm going crazy since I miss you. Think people can swim to Japan? I heard smugglers swam to Daemado isle. Think I can do it? I'm still pretty strong... Your mom got arthritis working so hard while you were in jail. Just worry about you and your mom from now on. Mi-ju didn't even write you once. What was that back then with Mr. Hwang? Oh, that... They're looking to hire some bodyguards from around here. Who is? There's a lot of shipping orders from Russia and Middle East these days. The rival companies hire men to throw off each others deadlines. They pay a lot but it's a tough job. The boss is from the docks, like us... When he takes in someone, I heard he takes good care of him. When one of his technicians got scouted elsewhere... He drove a truck through the guy's front door. He made him come back to work and bought him a new apartment. Who are you, sir? Good evening, men. I work for Suh-gun, too. I haven't seen you before. Are you a manager? Manager? I'm a little higher than that. Then are you... What the! You bastards! - That's hot. - Ow! You bastards! But there are stronger and smarter men to be your bodyguards, sir. I had men like that before. Why? You don't like me? No... It's not that, sir. Do you know Mengzi? Nancy, sir? No, the great philosopher. Oh... Sounded like my mama's name. Mengzi said... Envy those who have 100 times more than you. Respect those who have And become a slave to those who have way more than that. But I'm not asking you to become my slave. I'm saying that a man's power comes with money. Money will buy you respect. Money will look after your girl. Give me your youth and I'll give you power. Just remember. When the plane's racing down the runway... You have to hold your butt up slightly, man. Then the plane will take off smoothly. They're all doing it. It's a secret plane etiquette. Got it, man. While I'm away at Dubai, If Mi-ju ever comes back, give her this. There's a letter inside. Take care, bud. Don't worry about your mama. Members of the labor union! Brothers and sisters of Suh-gun! I am Sang Kim, leader of the union! Let's tell 'em what we want! - Do or die! - Fight! Fight! - Do or die! - Fight! Fight! - Do or die! - Fight! Fight! Evil Suh-gun! Go away! Let's fight for equal treatment of temp workers! Go and buy 200 milk and bread. Those women can't feed their children being in the riot. Yes, sir. Buy up all the fried chicken around. Yes, sir. Hurry! - What's going on! - It won't take long. Who the hell are you? I take gals who come pregnant with the boss' kid out west. Hand 'em over to some ugly sailors. And cast 'em off on wooden boats! The bastards who take our accounts to the press? I throw 'em off cliffs and make 'em get amnesia! That's who I am! Use your brain, fool! Or I'll throw 'ya down! I told you he was no good from the beginning! What if your dad finds out? - Just leave us alone! - What! Let me live my own life! Come in. God is so damn just. Four daughters... But not one of them turned out right. It's Nancy's birthday soon, right? Sir? Your mama, Nancy. How did you... I told 'em to set aside two apartments at our Busan site. Give one to your mom and put one in your name. And get some furniture with this. Thank you, sir. One more thing... When you go to Busan, go meet the governor's aid there. If he's not elected again, We'll lose the development rights in Russia. Yes, sir. I heard you don't drink or smoke. Yes, that's right. What do you do in the company? I heard you're the chairman's secretariat. I'm sorry, ma'am. Pardon? I don't plan to get set up and marry anytime soon. I hope you'll find someone better than me, next time. Hey you! Put that out. He's going to the mansion tonight, sir. I'll escort him, myself. Get the car. Yes, sir. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Mr. Lee, we'll meet for drinks again. Yes, sir. - Did you meet your mom? - Yes, sir. Good work today, son. What? Nothing, sir. Enjoy your night. Have a safe trip, sir. You had it rough cleaning up the gals for me, haven't you? No, sir. She's different. She's got class. I can take her anywhere. She's been with me over a year, but hasn't asked for a thing. Excuse me, ma'am. When you arrive at Dubai, go through different immigration lines. Our men there will get your bags. Go out through gate 3, and someone will meet you. They'll drive you to the hotel. The chairman will go in another car. He'll arrive at the hotel at 5p. m. after a business meeting. So, if you'll wait... Enjoy your trip, ma'am. Damned destiny... While you were in the States, In-ho did all the work. Welcome back, sir. It's good to see you Mr. Chae. I'll be outside, sir. Why don't you go study in the States? Sir? Get some experience and I'll hand you a small company to run. Thank you, sir. But I'm still... Just think about it. Oh, by the way. Yes, sir. She doesn't like staying at the mansion. She needs space. Get her a reasonable place. And buy her what she needs. Yes, sir. A maid will come by 3 times a week to clean and make food. No one knows your phone number but the boss and me. I tried to buy everything you might need. Oh, and I got a low, firm bed... The door's secret code is... It's good to leave the windows open like this. I asked them to paint it similar to this... Maybe I went a little too far... How about putting this up here... I'll be going ma'am. Let's... run away together. Go some place far away... And live together. Great weather, today. Mr. Chae. Yes, sir. It's Hanako's birthday next week. I'll be gone on business to Russia. Buy her a sturdy car. A sturdy car, sir? Is this sturdy? Of course, sir. Even the door is firm and heavy. How much? Good evening, sir. Anything you had in mind? Something expensive. A real diamond. There's something I really wanted to do if we ever met again. What is it? Kentucky. After what happened back then... I knew I couldn't live a normal life. A father who's a smuggler... My brother and mom burned to death... And... poor, innocent Boo who went to jail 'cuz of me... So when you mom asked me to stay away from you, I thought I should. When I was in jail... Once, I didn't eat or sleep for 4 days... Then somehow, I found myself doing the unthinkable. I was desperately lonely... I hated myself for being so stupid... I thought it'd be better just to die. But right then... You appeared to me. And you talked to me with tears. If I die... You'll be so sad. Turn it off. The kid meant a lot to me. I'll take care of it, sir. Handle it quickly and send him off. Sir, you have a guest from the head office. In-ho? In-ho got me the job here. He'll be promoted to director, soon. The boss must've owed him big in a past life or something. Just between you and me... He asked me to tie up any loose ends for his image sake. Of course. He'll become a director. But I heard he went to jail for attempted murder. Something against a gangster in Busan? It all happened 'cuz of a girl. The fool... I mean Mr. Chae... He had a girl back in high school... Sweet poetic justice... I'll do the bitch for free. I'll finish her off, good. Leave the girl. We'll take care of her. How's everything today. The chairman's here, sir. My trip got cancelled. I decided to hold the banquet here in Busan. Guess you didn't hear. Sorry, sir. Have you decided? Sir? Going to the States. I haven't had a chance to think, sir. What's to think? I said go. Want a bowl of noodles? If you didn't eat, have some. No thank you, sir. You close the deal with Alexi the governor's aid. Sir? You give them the campaign fund. Mr. Hyun senses they're not comfortable with him, yet. Let's run away, Mi-ju. Let's go to a small island in the Pacific. Anywhere where misery can't follow us. We'll build a small two-storey house. We won't have much, but we'll be happy. I'll promise to tell the boss... after some time passes. He'll forgive us. I believe in him. After doing one last job... I'll catch a ship to Japan. Cooperation project of development rights in Russia So hurry down to Busan and wait for me at the ferry terminal. I'll call you when I'm done. I'll call back later. Suh-gun gets development rights in Russia. Snap out of it, man. Thought I'd let you get away with what you did? Darn! I didn't do it right. I should stab you like you did to me! Why didn't you tell me, earlier? I wasn't thinking, sir... Stupid fools... When I was down and out... I pulled an innocent man in... And made his life miserable, too. I was so sorry... I regretted it so much... So I swore never to come to him, again. But... I couldn't stop loving him... Please, sir. Please don't let anything happen to him. Please... Mr. Hyun! Yes, sir. Where's In-ho? Don't spend it all on drinks. Yes, sir. Sir, you said you'll give us 3... Shut up, you fool! Hello? I only told 'em to beat him... But he was so feisty... My men made a little boo-boo... Damn cold. Mr. Chae! Where are you? Oh, Mr. Chae! I'm sorry, sir. I didn't tell 'em to but... You idiot! Hey, Boo. What 'ya doin'? Mi-ju Long time no see. Know who I am? Remember me? The one who first cut your cock... We got 99 more times to go. Remember? Aw, sorry... I told him how I jumped you... And he went mad so my boys had to beat him. He's dead. I wanted to at least give you his body... But they threw him in the sea... For fish bait. Go on loving him... Forever... Boo... you fuckin' bastard... In-ho... forgive him... Mr. Hyun didn't know they'd go that far... I'll look after you, too. Take care, sir. In-ho? Women are just a phase. Don't go, son. Not to me, sir. She isn't. Mi-ju... What would my life be, if I didn't love you? Then... It wouldn't be worth living...
