This little girl is 90% symbolism, ten percent precocious statements. What do y'all make of her? Professor Beckman? Call me Liv. And just chime in. Raising hands is for high school. Sorry. I think it's kind of ironic that Hester named her Pearl. How so? Pearls are associated with the color white, so we connect her with purity, innocence and all. Pearl should be read as innocent because of her association with white. Who agrees? Well, um, Professor Beckman... Liv. I think that, at the time, the color white was connected with purity. Symbolically. But then there was that part she was screaming at the village kids in tongues. So... obviously, some of her behavior isn't supposed to be innocent.

I don't understand what the two have to do... Last week, someone lit a cross on fire. This isn't an incident. It's an emergency. I will not allow myself to be scapegoated by a school that is unable or unwilling to see itself for what it truly is. If anyone really wanted to help that girl, it would be by ending the culture of hatred that vandalizes students' rooms, undervalues the work of professors of color and compels me to come stand before all of you today.
