Betrothed - Grant Jordan Katherine Armstrong Congratulations, Katie. I know that you and Grant will be wonderfully happy. Oh! Thank you Minna. This is an old story for me. Katie started taking over my boyfriends way back in grammar school. Now, you can't blame me for that. They were a very fickle bunch of kids. Yes, but I got them all back again in high school. Remember? Let's go to the living room. Shall we? We're having coffee there. -We are? -I told you! Remember? I'm so happy for you. Grant is a very lucky man. I don't know about that. I'm a lucky woman. -She can say that again. -Imagine the most eligible bachelor in town being captured by a widow. Excuse-me, Minna. Too bad we can't drop by the club to catch with Grant, but I understand women aren't allowed. That's right. It's stuck to this day. I bet those wicked old professors are having lots of fun kidding about what they are letting themselves in for. Only the tactless ones. Yes, Mrs. Wilson, that's the late Mr. Armstrong. It's a charming luncheon, isn't it? Mrs. Armstrong has made me feel as if I've lived in this town for years. We are ll happy to have you and Dr. Wilson as neighbors. Perhaps, if there's been a good doctor available then, poor Archie would be with us now. -How long since-- -Four years, nearly five. I guess Katie has been so busy she forgot to take it down and put it in the attic. Congratulations again, Katie. And I know you'll be very happy. Thank you. We all know you'll be happy and you will. Why do they all say it in a strange way, Minna? Is there any reason why, Mrs. Armstrong and Prof. Jordan shouldn't be happy? Well, you see- -Hello, mom. -Wait, wait, wait! -Are all those hers? -Yeah! The bride to be is what you may call a crowd. # Beautiful Katie, beautiful Katie. # # There's the lucky fellow that made her answer yes # At the time I was asked to accept the position of chancellor in the campi college, the deficit was... I know this is dull but, pay attention, the deficit was USD 201,674.00. Now, that's quite a deficit. No matter how you look ate it. But I am a man who like to look at the situation as a whole. Faculty Club. Faculty Club. Ah! Hello, Katie. Grant Jordan? Who's he? Oh He's in cargo expound about counterculture. He's very busy. I'm not. You just say the word and I'll be right over and I'll bring my own martinis. -Hello darling! -I just called up to gloat. My party's over. How you're doing? As a thrown to the core, they just brought the dancing girls. Yeah! You know where I'd rather be, darling. As soon as I can escape, I'll-- Hello, come in. -Shouldn't last much longer. -Are you sure it's all right? Sure, excuse-me. Father asked me to wait in the car, but I did so wanted to wish you luck. -I'll be down in 5 minutes. -Oh , yes, father. This is our last drink so it'll be a toast to you which I will deliver. -Thank you, sir. -Come on here, young fellow, where we can take a last look at the happiness -of bachelorhood. -Yes, but Katie is on-- Go on, go on, I'll explain to Katie. Hello, Katie. Minna. Naturally! What happened to Grant? He's too busy to talk right now, but I imagine you'll see him later. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye. Many of us remember Grant as a youth who came here from his father's farm. But let's skip all that and drink to Grant Jordan, the first Camden alumnus among us to become a father on his wedding day. If Minna had it her way, there wouldn't be even a bride on his wedding day. -You won't remember which one it was. -Why wouldn't I? You never remember the silly things that are so important to a woman. -Katie, do you feel all right? -I feel fine, why? You've been making some odd comments this evening. Have I? I'm sorry! It's he announcement party that got me. I still say you won't remember which one was. Oh, I won't, uh? It's not that one. No! Our bench. -Oh, hello, Professor Jordan. -Good evening, Tommy. -Come on. -That's all right, we're just leaving. -It's all yours, professor. -Thank you. Imagine an old couple like that trying to find a place to smooch. -Our bench! -In a park time basis. Well, we were sitting just like this, except that you had your arm-- -Then I said: Katie, will you-- -You did not! -I didn't? What did I say? -Nothing. Oh! And then I said: Katie-- No, you didn't. All you said was: Katie, how about it? -No! Very romantic! -I thought so. Being in love make you feel like it, doesn't it? I didn't know this type of elm grew up here. -I broght a pod in from California-- -Oh, Grant! -Grant! -Uh? Wasn't your party this afternoon supposed to be stag? -Yes, it was. -Who invited Minna? Ah! That's it! Nobody invited her. She just dropped by to pick up her father. Oh, she just dropped by so she could let me know she dropped by. Careful. Someone's gonna get the idea that you don't like her. Well, would you be crazy about an old crush of mine, -If I had an old crush... -If you had? What do you call all the competition I had to eliminate? There was Barton, there was Judge Dexter, there was Foster... -That's different! -What's different about it? I didn't want to marry any of them. I suppose I wanted to marry Minna. Everybody says you did. Well, why didn't you? That's why! -Now, forget Minna, will you? -Have you? Completely. If all the Minnas in the world had to had influential fathers. Has he mentioned the Botany building lately? He said: perhaps. He's recommending me at the board of directors meeting next month. And he's also recommended that they appoint me dean. In charge of the whole departament. -No! -Yes! Oh! Dean Jordan! Sounds a bit stuffy, but important. Whatever happens, Katie, I'm gonna do my best to be the right kind of husband... and father. I keep forgetting there'll be five of us. -Five of us! -Scared? No, it's just that I haven't had a chance to get acquainted with them. I wouldn't let you. First one I wanted you to get acquainted is me. Now, at once, I'm gonna be their father. Oh, darling. I know how you feel. I tried to be a father for them too. -You're much more of a type. -Thank you. I can't help thinking of that first time I'll have to ascertain myself. Mr. Jordan, you're not married yet, you're sitting on a park bench. -Well, this is it, honey, our bench. -Oh! -Pardon me, professor. -All yours, son. At least, it's your turn. Thank you, sir. An old couple like that neckling. -Well, here we are. -Phyllis baked an apple pie today. A thing like that has to be eaten all the way, doesn't it? Absolutely. -How about that? -Look at it! The kind mother used to try to make. There's milk in the ice box. Hey! Fried chicken! Professors and children shouldn't say "hey"! It's gonna be wonderful having a home and a family and Phyllis. -I fried that chicken! -You did? -Yeah! -Well, it's a new side of you, Katie. A very tasty side. A happy couple, isn't that what they call people like us? They did in tonight's paper. On the society page and all this. -Well... -I'll get your copy. -Would you like several? -Several? Phillys bought 25! Hello! -Good evening, Mr. Jordan. -Good evening, Mr. Jordan. -Evening! -Won't you come in? Did you bring me any candy? Well, no, I didn't, Zoe. I didn't expect to see you tonight. -I'd rather have pie anyway. -Me too. -All right! How about you, Abner? -He's Abner, I'm Charlie. Oh, that's right. Fine name Charlie. -My brother's name is Charlie. -You say that everytime you see me. -Not too big. -Right, Zoe. -What you mean not too big? -Oh, she always says these nonsenses. -Mommy is on a diet. -We have to do something about that. -I'll get some plates. -We'll do like you do. Zoe, I'm gonna help you. This is such a good idea. I think it tastes better this way, don't you? When I come to live here, we'll have a lot of parties like this. -No, if mom sees us, we won't. -Actually we'll start earlier. In the winter we can have our parties in front of the fire. We'll have popcorn. We'll roast marshmallows, uh? -Can you do any tricks? -He means magic tricks. -No, I can't. -Can you hypnotize people? Oh, well, I have put a lot of students to sleep. -Can you make a model airplane? -No. -My dad could... -Charlie! -I can make a sled. -We got 3 sleds. Good pie, uh? Can't you make anything? Oh, no! And pie? -He's eating the most. -I invited Mr. Jordan to have some pie. -He invited us. -Yes, I did. You said we should always do what Mr. Jordan asks us to. Well, I'm sure he didn't invite you to get out of bed. Now come over here, I'll help you. Oh, look at those hands! All right now, hurry back up to bed. Come on. -Good night! -Good night! Say good night to Mr. Jordan. -Good night, Mr. Jordan. -Good night! Oh! He got sat by that man! Zoe, he's not that man, he's Mr. Jordan! And he didn't sat on Pandy intentionally. He looks flatter. -I'm sorry, Zoe. -He's perfectly all right. I don't wanna hear another word. Hurry up! -Doesn't he look flatter? -I'll be there in a minute. Pie parties at midnight?! You'll be the most popular father in town. I don't know, I've a feeling I've just laid an egg. Oh, no! It's Mr. Fenster and Minna. That's a beautiful suit. I wonder where she bought it. That means everybody's here. Where are the children? Phyllis promised me faithfully she'd have them here 15 minutes before the ceremony. Do you think I have too much lipstick? They don't have the faintest idea of what to do. We should have had a rehearsal. Reverend Miller said "no, home weddings are so simple." Simple? Where's Reverend Miller by the way? -Have you seen him? -Yes, dear, twice. Oh, Jo! Oh, poor Jo! You worked so hard and now you're gonna have the children for two whole weeks. That's what old maiden sisters are for, darling. Other people's weddings, other people's children. Thanks God we serve for some purpose in life. Oh, Katie! Katie! Please stand still! All right, all right... Travel suits, accessories, my dinner robes... The children's suitcases are in their room and they are all packed. I know, dear. I packed and close it. Oh, I told Charlie and Abner they can go swimming in the pond pool whenever you're able to take them, but not in the lake. And don't you let them tell you otherwise. Great... The alligator shoes, Jo, the alligator shoes. Katie, everything is packed. Everything! Just relax. Grant's here, isn't he? I don't know. I haven't seen him. -You haven't seen him? -I'm sure he's here. How can you be sure if you haven't seen him? Oh, Katie! But there have been brides who have forgotten to show ate their own weddings. And you know what they say about professors. Oh, Mr. Jordan. -Hello, Phyllis. -Morning, Mr. Jordan. Quite a crowd down there. Grant, you shouldn't be up here! -Where are the children? -I don't know. These just came. We don't need the flowers yet. Just put them in the ice box and find the children. But I wanna see Miss Katie. Those caterers didn't bring... Don't bother about the caterers. I'll be down in a minute. Just put the children in the ice box and find the flowers! -You know what I mean. -Yes. You can't see Katie before the wedding. You know it's bad luck. I don't want to see anybody. I just want a place to hide. Try the service porch. Boys, your mother wants you. -Hello, man. -Hello, Mr. Jordan. Well, today is a big day for all of us, isn't it? Yes, you ought to see the cake and the sandwiches! And the punch has real cherries in it. I'm glad there'll be plenty to eat, but... Why don't you fellows sit down here and we'll have a little talk? -Now, boys, after today... -Are you still here? Boys, your mother wants you. You too, Zoe. Come on. Get on here. -Hello, Zoe. -Hello. Now, you be good and stay here until I come back. And don't you step on him. I wouldn't think of doing something like that. You sat on him once. Zoe, please! I'm gonna sleep at Aunt Jo's when you and mom are on honeymoon. Where you're gonna sleep? Instead of coming from the sunroom, I think it would be better if you and your sister would come from the hallway which is facing where we should stand. Directly in front of you will be the little flower girl. How can I be little flower girl if I don't have any flowers? Directly ahead of the flower girl will be these two young ringbearers who will continue to the right and that is their left and to the right of the best man. Do you understand? -Yes. -Do you, boys? Which little man will pass the ring to the best man? -I am. -Well, you're gonna have that. Well, you must decide this question, mother. Abner is the older. I think he should be the one. Why can't I do? He gets to do everything! Is it settled that the bearer should be this one? Yes. Well now we join the groom. Well, I don't think I've ever seen a groom quite so nervous. But it will pass. Great happiness will be his. Thank you, Doctor Miller. Oh, guys, I want you to be every bit as happy as I am. Mr. Jordan is gonna be a wonderful daddy to you. I know you're going to love him. Aren't you? Yes, mom. Now, run along. Oh, Jo! Don't you cry. Don't you dare crying! Are you gonna cry, mommy? No, mommy is not going to cry and neither is my little flower girl. How can I be a little flower girl when I don't have any flowers? My Godness! They're in the ice box. -I'll get them. -No! -Stay right here both of you. -Come here, let me see this. What the... Oh, Jo! -Jo! -Is she dead? -Oh, my Godness! -Jo... Get Doctor Wilson! Yes, Mrs! What's that? Oh! No, don't. You must not try to get up. Don't be silly. I'm all right. Oh! The flowers! Zoe, the flowers! We're not going ahead with the wedding now. If you think I'm going through this again, you're crazy. Oh, Dr. Wilson, my sister fell down the stairs. Get Mr. Jordan and tell Mrs. Carp to stop playing that piano. Don't you dare stop anything. Would you get my bag from my car, please? -Yes, sir. -There's nothing serious, is it? -Well I... -Just a minor sprain. Yes, just a minor sprain. Now, you see? Go get married! -Not without you. -Katie, please! Everyone is waiting. I don't care. Let them wait! It will take quite a while to take this up eventhough it isn't very serious, but she'll be all right. I'll have her ready for the reception. You get out there. If Mrs. Carp play that again, I'll go mad. -Oh, Jo! -Mommy, please, I've never seen -you get married before. -Katie, please. In health, sickness, prosperity, and adversity and foresaking all others and keep her alone and to yourself as long -as you both shall live? -I will. Do you Katherine take this man as your lawfully wedded husband to live together in life through the state of matrimony? I do. Will you love and honor him as a faithful woman is bound to do in health, sickness, prosperity, and adversity, and foresaking all others and keep him alone and to yourself as long -as you both shall live? -I will. Abner, the ring. Abner, the ring! Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. I now pronounce you man and wife. Did you marry mommy? I think I did. Oh, Jo! Her leg is broken, Mrs. Armstrong. Oh, Mrs. Jordan! Congratulations! -A minor sprain! -Don't blame him. It was me. Oh, where are you taking her? To the hospital. I'll meet you there. It was a beautiful wedding, Katie. I didn't miss a word! -Katie, what happened? -She broke her leg. Doctor said she'll be in a cast for weeks. Weeks? -Broke her leg in a few places. -The poor dear! Fell downstairs. Are we gonna ride with you, Aunt Jo? No, dear. Good heavens, Katie! The children! Don't worry about that. They'll all right. -But, I'll stay with them. -Darling, don't you worry about it. -Good bye, Aunt Jo. -Bye, Jo. -Darling... -Bye, Jo. -Goodbye, dear. -Goodbye, Miss Jo. Oh, isn't that a shame? Now you'll have to postpone your honeymoon. Oh, no, we won't. Not for long anyway. I'll change the plane reservations for tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -We'll find someone by then. If father and I weren't leaving for California, I'd... Thank you, Minna. I wouldn't dream of asking you to take care of my children. -Why can't Phyllis take care? -No, sir. No, sir. Miss Katie promised vacation and I'm going to my mother. -Phyllis, couldn't you? -No, mam. Mom will be 98 next Tuesday and she'll only be 98 once in her life. Well, I suppose a promise is a promise. I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan, but I just gotta be at mommy's birthday. I understand. 98, uh? And she's beginning to look it too. Phyllis, take our bags to my room. Well, I'm not sure what Emily Post would suggest in a situation like this but there's a wedding cake to be cut. -Are you gonna stay here tonight? -Yes, dear. What about your honeymoon? We'll find someone to take care of you, children. Who? We don't know yet, but we'll find someone, won't we? Yes, of course, we'll find someone. Ah! You sit right here. Charlie! -I don't like riding backwards. -So do I. Zoe, now take this chair. We can put the chairs together and she can sit in the middle. Oh, fine! Oh, I beg your pardon. You all right? Let's put the teddy down here. I made botany studies in this territory. This great bauxite country. -Coal, sir. -I beg your pardon? Coal Country. -When will we be in the Grand Canyon? -What's it like? Oh, it's very big! And there'll be a lot of interesting places for you children to go and see. -Here you are, Zoe. -Is it after 5 o'clock? -Yes, considerably. -I can't drink anything after 5 o'lock. -Wanna know why? -Abner! -Do you see anything you like, Zoe? -Oh, darling, she can't read that! Of course not. I'll tell you what it says. -I'll order for her. -Oh, boy! Turkey! -That's for me! -How do you all like the creamed tuna? -Why should we eat that stuff? -Because it'ss the 90-cent special. Creamed tuna will make me sick riding backwards I'll have turkey. Me too! And a chocolate fudge sundae. The children and I will have creamed tuna. The children, you and I will have turkey. Grant, it's so expensive! The sky is the limit for the next two weeks. This is our... honeymoon! Yes, and ours. Aunt Jo couldn't take care of us. -Did she break her leg on purpose? -Of course not! Mrs. Peck told Mrs. Carp she did. I'm glad you couldn't get anybody else to stay home with us. So am I! A honeymoon is fun! -Mommy, didn't anybody wan us? -I did, Zoe. Are you glad you're going to the Grand Canyon? Are we going to sleep in it tonight? No. We'll sleep on the train tonight. -Will you sleep with me? -No, darling. Are you gonna sleep with that man? I'm going to sleep with daddy. But, mommy I... Hey! Look! There's a newsstand right there! We could... -Shh! -We wanna come. Can we get off? Please! All right, but I want the porter to go with you. -I'll go with them. -All right. I'm getting off for a cigar. I'll watch them. -Thank you. -Do you need some money, boys? No. I gave them their allowance this morning. -Hurry back. -How am I doing? Beautifully! No one would suspect you're not the father of our children. It's bad enough marrying into a ready-made family without having to take them all on your honeymoon. You're sorry you suggested it? Family honeymoon is better than no honeymoon. It's a chance for us to get better acquainted. Zoe doesn't look very comfortable there. I'd better call the porter and have them made the children's beds, uh? But, darling, it's still light out. Oh, but it's 7:30. This part of the year practically never gets dark. Let's sit over there where we can talk. All right. Oh, I'll take care of things for you, sir. Oh, thanks. Sure smells good in here. Sweet as a honeymoon. -Does it? -Don't you remember? Remember? I... Katie? I beg your pardon. I can't find the boys! They're not here. -They should be. -I know, but they aren't. -Did you look in the car ahead? -Yes. -How about the fron car? -No. I can't find the conductor either. But we did search the train, every car! They certainly got back on when I did. -Is it about those boys? -Yes! Did the little one have prominent teeth? -Yes. -No. What about them? They got off the train when we stopped in Porterville. Yes, but they got on again. They had to go on again because they got off 3 times. When I left, I saw them buying something at the candy counter. And why didn't you take them with you? Oh, Grant! Stop the train! I can't stop the train. -Katie, no! -Listen to me... You shouldn't have done that. Oh! I'm terribly sorry! We've got to- We've got to get back to Porterville. But Katie, it must be 40 miles from here. 60. And you can't walk right out the prairie country and hail a taxi, you know? Well, there'll be a train coming the other way, won't it? But you can't... Well, I believe you could do that. What happened? I stopped the train. And don't you dare start it before we're ready o get off. All right, all right. The lady just stopped the train. Katie, we're not leaving this train until the next stop. That's Junction City. We'll be there in another hour. -Another hour? -Yes. Then you can hire a taxi to take you back. What about my boys while that's going on? Well, we usually telegraph back to the station agent to look after them. -You mean this has happened before? -Once or twice, yes. Oh, why didn't you tell me? Darling, you send the telegram and tell the station agent just what Charlie and Abner look like and to take care of them. -Mommy, will we ever see them again? -Sure we will, Zoe, in a little while. Darling, you get dressed, I'll dress Zoe. May I signal to the train to start now, ma'am? -Yes. -Thank you. Oh, here's the phone. There's a taxi number. Well, that might teach these boys of yours a lesson. I bet they're scared penguins. They shouldn't be if the station master is taking care of them. He must have our telegram by now. I wouldn't be too sure. Poor Paul Astrin ran away a couple of years ago. You know when your parents are too hard on you. You know when kids get idiotic sometimes. Well, he hopped the freak! 3 days after he left they brought him back home. What he could find of him. -It call to mind another case... -What do they grow around here? Nothing ever grows around here. It calls to mind another case. A couple of neighbor kids ran away with the circus. They must grow something around here. -I see so many farms, barns. -All're bad. Well, should these kids water the elephants one day and a big bull elephant picked one up and hit the other kid. They're back home now, but they don't make much sense when they talk. Grant! Now, mother, I know how you feel, but you mustn't let it get you. Steer yourself. Think of cheerful thoughts as you can. We must help her to think of them. Mommy, will we ever see them again? We certainly will, darling. It calls to mind another case. Little William... We came for our boys. -Abner and Charlie? -Yes. They left before I got your telegram. You mean you let these two helpless little boys just leave? Where did they go? You see, I was helping Tom Roswell carry his sample cases out to his car. Tom is an old friend of mine and travels for Gordon Girdles. What does this have to do with the children? They asked Tom for a ride. They said they had to catch up with the train. Tom offered to take them as far as Junction City. Junction... But we just came from there! Looks like we're going back. Hey! You wanna know what I think? No! Things are bad enough already. Oh, can't you go a little faster? No, mother, this is the thing with this road, they ditched a car -about a mile ahead last week. -I don't care. The lady that was in the back seat is laying in the hospital right now with her head on her lap. I don't care about that either! I don't care about anything until I find my boys. Will you make this old thing goes as fast as it can? And don't you stop for anything! Stop at that service station. Gordon Girdles! Where are they? The back seat is full of them, but I don't do retail business, only in special occasions. What have you done with my boys? Your boys?! So you're the mommy? -Yes. -Well... And this is daddy. -Oh, glad to meet you, daddy. -Thanks. -What about the boys? -You just missed them. -Again? -Well, you see with my jalopy stall, they got kind of scared of not catching that train so they started out. -You mean hitch-hiking? -No, they drove off with a farmer. He said he'd put them up at his house for the night and then take them to Porterville in the morning. And you let them? You just stood there and let them... -Do you have any idea who he was? -Oh! What was his name? -Hey, Butch! What was his name? -Who? Of the farmer. The man who drove off with the two boys. -Webb. -Where does he live? -Where does he live? -Who? The farmer! Mr. Webb! Where does he live? Oh! Well, you go down to the Myrtle Tree School and turn your left for a quarter of a mile and then... Joe, listen to this. Start all over again. You go down to the Myrtle Tree School House and go to your left for about a quarter of a mile and when you come to the windmill, you adjust to your right for about three quarters of a mile and you turn sharp up you your right again for another quarter of a mile and you'll see a grove of elm trees that is ahead. That's where he lives. -Who? -Mr. Webb, the farmer. Don't ask any more questions. Just get us there as fast as you can. Thank you. Wait! I forgot Pandy. They darn nearly lost another one. I got your daughter for you. -Are they kidnappers? -Shut up! Hello! Is this where Mr. Webb lives? Is that you, Mr. Webb? -Who wants to know? -Oh, we do! We're looking for a couple of boys. Get in front of the car. -Yeah! You look like parents. -I am. I mean we are. I'm Webb all right. I was just being careful cause there's a missing chickens thieves around here. Turn on the lights, Dory! Everything's all right. Follow me, folks. -Where are you taking us? -To the barn. -Why? -Are the boys there? Yes, they are and they're having the time of their lives. Why didn't you say so? Oh, how can they be having the time of their lives when they're lost and I'm going crazy trying to find them? -Charlie! Abner! -It's mom! -Oh, darlings! -Hello, boys. Did you bring my comic books? -What have you been playing with? -We haven't been playing with anything. -We've been helping Jess. -That's what I meant. -We're helping him skin a skunk. -Go back there with Zoe. No, no, honey. You just stay right there. Well, boys, let's get you... Well, take your clothes off. -Nice little family you got out there. -I think so. -Only three kids so far? -Well... yes. Wait until you've been married as long as Dory and me. We got six. I can wait. Hey, Jess, you'd better put your clothes on the line too. I'll just hang them out of the window. I'm sorry. I'm so glad you decided to stay. I like company but we never have any. -And it gets kind of lonesome. -With six children? Are you sure you got room for all of us? -Oh, our magic tricks! -Abner, we're... -Not in the tub! -Abner! Abner is not in the tub! Look just like their father, don't they? Both of them. Image of you. -Oh, do you think so? -He is my... Are you positive you got room for all of us? Well, we'll have to do some doubling up. Oh, we won't mind that. No, sir. Not at all. I bet your wife picked them out. She's never even seen them. I bought them for this trip. Good night, sweetheart! I hope you get a good night sleep. You'll sure need it for the trip. -Why? -The trains out of Porterville only have day coaches all the way to the Grand Canyon. Come on! Get up! Get up! Mr. Jordan! And I thought I got myself a chicken thief. -Did you hurt yourself? -No. Did you get them, Zak? No, it's all right, Dory. Go back to sleep. What were you doing out? I- I collect specimens. I happen to be a botany professor. Oh! Go right ahead along with the specimens. -Good night. -Good night. You can see better in the daylight. Don't you think? -What happened? -Webb thought I was a chicken thief. -Oh, no! -I couldn't sleep. I couldn't either. We should have brought our bench. Allow me, Mrs. Jordan. I give up! Here we are, Mr. Webb. I- I don't mean to be a bad host, but would you be kind enough to go to bed so I can get some sleep? -We're sorry. -I'll see you in the morning, dear. -Good night. -Good night, dear.

I wanna go to bed! Darling, there aren't any beds in this train. How can we sleep if there aren't any beds? Don't worry, Zoe. We'll all get it fixed out. Wouldn't it be fun like camping out? -Pillows? -Yes, five. -Pandy needs a pillow too. -No, no, no, no. And no pillow fights, did you hear me? -I'll go get the others. -We also would like three more seats. Three more seats? Mister, there isn't an empty seat on the whole train. -How can five sleep in two seats? -Well, if you get up, I'll show you how. Come on! Get up! First of all, we turn this seat over like this. -I got a fun bed like we got at home. -No, Zoe. -I got a seat... -Don't Zoe, get down. Charlie, come up here now. Stop that nonsense. I'm so sorry. It's all right, madam. I'm used to children. All kinds of them. Now, just make yourselves comfortable. I'll go get the rest of the pillows. I thought he was going to show us how. We'll just have to do this scientifically. Zoe, you get to sit here. Charlie, on this seat. Oh, darling, that will never work. Well, I was gonna put Abner on the other side. Oh, no, no. Let me, let me. Zoe, get up. Now, you sit there. Would you mind holding this for just a minute? Here. Thank you. Yes, now, Charlie turn around and sit facing daddy. -How can I sleep sitting up? -Well scrunch down a little. -Comfortable? -This is keen! -Yes, now. Now I sit here. -Now, you're being scientific. Where do I go? You're gonna sit there and put your feet here, see? -Uhu! -Sounds fine. What about me? You're gonna have the best seat of all, now, watch. Here we go! Here you are. Five pillows. It'll be a dollar and a quarter. Thank you. That's fine. -See? -Thank you. But you have to get these bags out of the aisle here. Well, it's all right. No one will take them. Well, it hasn't the matter. We got to keep the aisle clear. Oh, my legs! Oh! -I'll just... -Grant! I'll put them. Hold on, mister, over there, up, up a little higher. I got two more. Can't you put the bags outside some place? No, they won't fit out. I'll just get this one in here and see: That's it! Now, we'll see how can I get this one. -Join the baby around these ones. -Oh, no. -Put her legs down here. -Where? That's it. Now I'll put this right here. -Right in the middle. -Oh, no. -That's that. -Are you sure the aisle is clear? Oh, yes. The aisle is clear. -That's fine. -Well, pleasant dreams, folks. -Grant! -Here's your other bag. Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot all about it, thanks. -Mommy! -Go to sleep, sweetie! You didn't kiss me good night. Oh, good night, dear. Look out. Good night. Entering Grand Canyon National Park US Dept Of Interior National Park Service -Come on. -Indians! Look at this. No, no, Abner. Stay with us. Charlie, pull up your trousers. -Now, where's Zoe? -Here I am. Oh, Zoe! -Zoe! -Look at me! -You look like an indian princess. -US 4.95 including tax. -No, Grant, no. -I wanna give to the kid. Gosh! -Gee! -Two more. No! It's a beautiful place. Oh, darling! What a wonderful honeymoon we're going to have! -This room is ideal for the children. -I want this one. Take it easy, boys. Hey, you can see outside! -Mommy, will that man sleep there? -Is there someone else in the party? No, no. Just the five of us. That's your bed, darling. But, mommy. And mommy and daddy will be right there. Oh, Grant! That's beautiful! Those beds... I'm very proud of our springs. They're called foamy clouds. Just wait until tonight and you'll know what I mean. I don't think I can wait. We spent two nights on a day coach. -Ah! Foamy cloud! -Now go get ready for your bath. Now, we don't need something like this. No, of course not. Now, run along. Grant, I'm gonna take the children't bags to the other room. -Oh, I'll take them. -All right. Charlie, Abner! Get those clothes off. We're gonna take our baths. -Oh, mom, not. -Wonderful little mother. Yes. Yes. Darling, you can use the shower first. # Oh, give me a home in the Buffalo. # # Oh, give me a home in the Buffalo. # Mr. Jordan! -Which way did they go? -They went that way. Shhh! Oh! Darling what are you doing there? This family seems to forget that I'm a man. I like some privacy. Oh, my, no, darling! It's surprising how quickly you'll get used to not having any. Your new sport jacket is really elegant. -You're gonna wear it this morning? -Sure. -And this tie? -All right. Oh, here's a lovely blue shirt. Oh, that's the one Minna gave me last Christmas. Oh, I didn't see this white one. It's perfect for daylight. They're so crisp and cool looking. I see socks and... Oh, what are these? These are some ideas I have drawn for the new botany building. If I ever get around to it. It's wonderful! They don't seem very important right now. Neither do the blue shirts and white shirts, do they? -It's so quiet. -Yeah! -The children must be up to something! -Oh, Katie... I'm sorry! Everybody's going up till the border of the canyon. -On a mule. -Starting in half an hour. -With a real guide and everything. -Can we go, mom? Please! You'll have to ask daddy. -Can we? -Pop? You said there'll be guides to take care of you? -Yes! -How long do the trip last? -All day. -Sounds like a wonderful idea! -How much money will you need? -You have to pay the man yourself. Why? He said we can't go without our parents. Oh! Rent Riding Clothes and Cowboy Suits Here Now, be good. Let me look at those. Oh, you look wonderful. Just a little more right. No, Zoe, don't. -No, no, that's enough. -I want a big one. -Me too! -Shhh! -How many in the party? -Five. Oh, yes, you're the Jordans. Come on. You almost got a party for yourselves. Let's see. You and your wife will take Emily and Rose. -Emily and Rose? -Yeah! This is Emily and that is Rose. I've got some nice gentlemen over there for the children. Oh, what fun! You sure that she is not too small? No, we've had them half of her size, Mrs. Jordan. -And I'll be right with them. -Thank you! -Come on, kids! -Go on now. Do what the gentleman tells you to. Well, I guess I'll take Emily. -Hello, you honeymooners! -Minna! -I thought you were in California. -Well, you know father. He always wants to stop and see everything. -You two are much alike! -But I must admit I did persuaded him to stop here. You see just before we left, he had a letter from the board of directors. They'll be meeting in Santa Barbara as they're all there for the summer anyway. And I think it would be a wonderful idea if you sketched a few of your plans for that botany building so father could take them with him. It wouln't take long and I'm sure Katie would excuse you for this little excursion. Well, that won't be necessary. I brought these sketches with me. -Oh! -Isn't that wonderful? Go get them for her, darling. Oh, father will want to discuss the sketches with you. You know father and his discussions. Well, tell him we'll get together tonight. -Oh! We're leaving this afternoon. -Oh! And I think this is dreadfully important. Don't you, Katie? Yes, yes I do. Yes, you really should have a talk with Mr. Fenster, darling. And Minna will go with us. Oh, no, not me, thank you. I never was the outdoors type. Oh, hello! I just thought we go for the talk. Maybe we could take this trip tomorrow. You'd better hop along, we're right to get going. Oh, I guess, we couldn't. I'm sorry, darling. Have a good trip. I'll see you later, uh? -Yes, goodbye! -Goodbye! Goodbye, Katie. -Hello, Mr. Fenster. -Hello, Zoe. -Hello. -How are you, Charlie? -Hi, Mr. Fenster. -Hello, Abner. -Having a good time? -Oh, yeah! -Hello, Mr. Fenster. -Well, well... A whole week at the Grand Canyon? -Great, isn't it? -Yeah! What a spot! This is truly the almighty country! Where's Grant? He's at the lodge. Waiting for you. Why shoud he wait for me? We understood you wanted to talk to him about his sketches. Well, yes, but I could do that tonight or in the morning. We're staying, over you know? No, I didn't know. Minna said you were leaving this afternoon. Oh, strange girl, Minna. Must have sommething on her mind. Sometimes I wonder. Don't you? To put it politely: yes. -Goodbye. -Bye. It's just like the old times, isn't it? The two of us together. I'm sorry you didn't tell me your father had gone for a hike. I'll never forget our last work, will you? He's probably back at the lodge by now. I'll go get the sketches. -Is Mr. Fenster back yet? -Yes, he came back about 10 minutes ago. He went directly to his room for a nap. -For a nap? -He was exhausted from his hike. He said he didn't want to be disturbed. Oh, well. I'll bring up the sketches after lunch. -He should be awaken by then. -Why don't we have lunch together? There's no need for both of us to eat alone. -Let's go for a dip in the pool first. -Well... If you don't think Katie would mind. No, why should she mind? She knows I can swim. -Can we have our key, please? -And how did you like your trip? Oh, I couldn't possibly find words to describe it. Yes, it's lovely. isn't it? Your husband is in the bar. -With Mr. Fenster? -I believe he's with Miss Fenster. Oh, thank you. Abner, here's the key, now, I'll be up in just a minute. -You get ready for your bath. -Another one? -We took a bath this morning. -I know, but that was hours ago. Now, go on, please. Go on. -Oh, Katie! -Hello, Katie! -Hello. -Had a good time? -Fine. -Where are the children? They've gone upstairs. Did Mr. Fenster like the sketches? -He hasn't seen them yet. -Oh, but he will. We decided to stay over. We can all have dinner together, uh? Oh, I imagine Katie would like to rest for a while and have dinner in the room. Why? You look a little, I mean, you must be tired. Tired? Why would I be tired? I haven't done a thing all day, but sit. Thanks for a lovely time, Grant. It was a delightful lunch and swim, a little talk. It should be a great evening too. The clerk told me there'll be a dancing at dinner with a band. Should we make a real celebration and dress? Did you bring a formal? Oh, I... I came fully prepared meet any minor crisis. -Bye. -Goodbye. See you later. -Katie. I missed you. -I don't see why. -Little man, you had a busy day. -How was I to know Mr. Fenster would be hiking and napping all the time. Don't you realize she kept trying everything? Only a woman would do what she did. Only a woman like Minna, I mean. We can't ignore her. At least we can keep her on our good side. Oh, she can, really! Katie, let's have dinner in our room, just the two of us like I said, uh? And have Minna think I'm afraid of her? Oh, no, no. We're dining with the Fensters. There's so much to be done. My hair... I need a manicure. Things have to be pressed. And what about the children? Who's gonna take care of them while I'm at the hairdresser's? They have a father now, in case you've forgotten. Well, you never tried to manage them alone. Until now. Are you sure you don't mind? Thanks. Katie, is your dress ready? I think so, why? I want you to be the most beautiful girl in the dining room tonight. Oh, Grant! Mommy, Charlie took all the towels. How can I take a bath if I haven't got any towels? All right, darling, I'm coming. -Who's Minna, Mr. Jordan? -Where's me pull? -I'm first! -I'm second! I'm second! Push me again, Mr. Jordan. Look behind you, Mr. Jordan. -Who's the idea of that? -You're supposed to duck. Ha ha Walk closer to the wall, so I can see down. I wanna walk on the wall. No, honey, that's too dangerous. The wall wasn't built to walk on. It's just to keep people, specially boys and girls, from falling in the canyon. It's a long way down. Charlie! Abner! HYPNOTIZE YOUR FRIENDS -Oh, hello, Minna. -Don't get up. -Where's Katie? -She went to the hairdresser's. -And she left you with the children? -I wanted to be left with the them. -Is your father still asleep? -No, he's taking his bath. Let's go for a walk. Nothing can happen to them. Everything can happen to them. Then let's stay here and talk. There's the ice cream man. I'll get them some cones. Three chocolate cones, please. I don't think they're supposed to have it. It's pretty close to their dinner time. Oh, don't you be such a cruel stepfather. Oh, I guess only one. No, no,no, no. It's my treat. You know, I forgot my purse. -Thank you. -Thank you. Where had they gone? Pardon, did you happen to see where they went? -See who? -My wife's children. Why, no. There! I'm her master. You must obey. -Come to me slowly. -Ice cream! -You made me drop Pandy! -I'll get you a new one. I don't want another one. I want my Pandy! -I'll get you a great big one. -I don't want a big one! -I want my Pandy! -Try this. All right, sweety. Don't get up. I want my Pandy! Oh! -I want my Pandy! -He slipped away. -Let dad get you another one. -I want my Pandy! You made me drop it! You go and get it! -I want my Pandy! -All right! All right! I'll go. -Oh, no, Grant, no! -I want my Pandy! -Be careful, Grant. -I want my Pandy! -I want my Pandy! -Shh! He's all right. Oh, Grant, be careful. Now, are you satisfied? -There! -It's all dirty. -Thank you, Mr. Jordan. -You're welcome, Miss Jordan. Mr. Jordan, I wish you'd come inside. I can't do anything with your sons. There must be some mistake, my boys are... -Where are they? -Everywhere! Right now they are in the kitchen and guests are not allowed in the service department. Oh! They are in my elevator! They jumped in and slided the doors. Charlie! Abner! Open this door! Stop! Are they going to stop? They'd better! Can't you do something? What would you suggest? Isn't there a way to shut the current? You must have a maintenance man. Two, please. Yes, sir. Mr. Jordan, what are you gonna do with them? Mr. Jordan! BEAUTY SHOP What happened? Grant just went upstairs with blood in his eyes and one of your cherubs under each arm. I can't say that I blame him. Thank you! Let me go. You're hurting me! Put them down! Put them down! Or I'll call mommy! Put them down! Put them down! You stay out here, Zoe. What you're gonna do with them, Mr. Jordan? Charlie come here. No! Zoe! Zoe! What's the matter? -Mommy, he's killing them! -Oh... -Hello, Katie! -Mom! They deserved every whack. -We're just playing in the elevator. -He got mad and beat us! You know better than that, Katie. You saw it, mom. You saw him beauting us. Now, that's enough! I'm sure you wouldn't have done this without a reason. -Oh, why did I leave you alone? -You didn't leave them alone. -You left them with me. -You left us alone. Yes, when you walked with Miss Fenster. And she gave him a parasol so he could knock Pandy into the Grand Canyon. That'll be also enough. Come on, get back into your room, all of you. You just can't resist that woman, can you? Minna had nothing to do with it. Oh, Minna has nothing to do with anything, but she's always there when it happens. Even in our honeymoon. Or did you invite her? Of course. We arranged all this weeks ago. You left my children to go with her. -I did not leave the children. -They said you did. What difference does it make what they said? They were hysterical. -My children hysterical?! -Yes, and so are you! You gave me the authority to discipline them and now that I had you can't take it. What I can't take is your constant association with Minna. Can you stop implying that we are carrying on a romance? Your attitude is ridiculous. And childish! Well, I suppose it's considered very adult and sofisticated to share your honeymoon with another woman? What about me? I'm sharing my honeymoon with three children! Oh! That isn't exactly what I meant to say. I realize it's difficult enough for two people to adjust themselves without taking three more personalities. Even if the children hadn't come, Minna would still be here. Katie, we can't start up like this. What happened to the faith and understanding we promised each other? If you only offered to stop seeing her. -Oh, Katie, you're imposible! -And childish, don't forget that! Yes, you certainly are. You're childish enough to be spanked. -And now he wants to hit me! -I don't wanna hit anybody! Katie! Katie, won't you at least give me a chance to explain what happened? The children and I confronted badly and in the elevator, the playground and the summit. Will you please stop crying and listen to me? Stop all of you! Stop it! Oh, what kind of family I married into. What kind of a family have you married into?! -That's what I said! -Well if you don't like it, you'd better get out! -Mommy, is that man going to get out? -He certainly is! Here's an interesting tour: Buckaroo Trails round trip, six hours and twenty minutes. Leaves the lodge at 5 am. -On a mule, no doubt? -Yes, let's take it. Let's not! I saw Katie Jordan as they got one of those mule tours. -Oh, Grant, hello! -Hello. I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. -I'm going back. -Uh? Take me back to the lodge. I forgot something. -You'll miss your train. -I can always catch a train. Where's Mrs. Jordan? I don't know anything about the people who just checked out! Checked out?! There's no need to change... -Uh? -Nothing! Josephine Stevens Arriving tonight. Love: Katie. Madge, it's Jo. They're getting in tonight. I know it doesn't give us much time, but round up everyone you can. No, I can take care of the food. I'm at Katie's house now. And Phyllis will be back to help me. Fine, goodbye! Be careful! Thank you! You take those. -Carrying services, mam? -No, no thanks. -All right, come on. -Can I have an apple? Oh, no, darling. I haven't any left. I'm so hungry I'd eat a tiger. Well, Phyllis will fix us a lot of things as soon as we get home. -Taxi? -Yes, please. But, mom, we haven't any money. When mommy's home, she can write a check. Sorry, lady, no checks. If you insist upon cash, I'll get it with my cook. You take us to 164 South Hudson. No, no, you stay there. I'll get your money. # Happy homecoming to you! Happy homecoming to you! # # Happy homecoming, dear Katie. # -Miss katie! -Shh! You shouldn't be sneaking like this. Miss Jo wanted it to be a surprise. -It was. -Where's Mr. Grant and the children? Outside. I mean, the children are outside. -I don't know where Mr. Grant is. -Oh! Oh my! I can't face them without him. I just can't... I made up a batch of sandwiches just in case you run short. -Thank you, Mrs. Carp. -Two kinds: Ham and double egg. Hum! My favorite kinds! And now, do you need any help? -Oh, no, mam. No, thanks. -If you do... Yes. Go get Miss Jo quickly. I told you to stay off that leg. Phyllis! I told Phyllis to let me know if she needs help. You mind the doctor and stay put. -What's that? -It's your dinner. -Oh boy! -Gee! Can I trust you to take them for a nice long ride? Trust me, lady? They're safer with me then they'd be -with you at the wheel. -I don't doubt that, but please hurry before someone sees them. I got to get them out of the way. It's a surprise party. Mom, why don't we go into the house? -Is Mr. Jordan in there? -No. I wish he were. I thought you didn't want to see him again. I've never wanted to see someone so much in my whole life! You call me in 15 minutes. The number is 2424. Ask for Phyllis. OK, Phyllis. If Mr. Jordan come, ask him about Pandy. Shh! -Hello, Jo. How's the leg? -Fine. Good! Phyllis, I saw you go there and whisper to her. What if I needn't any help? Well, you just can't manage to be proud like this alone! I'm gonna stay right here and pitch in. I get the sandwiches ready to serve. -But where are they? -I too fix them here. Oh, I mean my sandwiches. The ones in the basket. Oh, Minna, I didn't know you were back. We flew in a little while ago and I'm so glad we did because this is the one party I wouldn't want to miss. You did intend to invite us, didn't you? I thought you were in California. No, we didn't get any farther than the Grand Canyon. -Where's Grant? -Grant and Katie haven't arrived yet. Oh, I thought Grant left before she did. See you later. I can't understand it. I just can't understand it. Isn't it that those were nice sandwiches too? Yes, your favorite kind! I took them. The children were hungry. Phyllis, what do I do? What did Mr. Grant do? That's what I'd like to know. He did what whas absolutely right but I didn't realize until I had to travel alone with my children. Phyllis, they need him. Well, maybe he could sneak in like you did. Why not call that place where he used to live? Yes! Four dozen sandwiches vanished like into thin air! -I'll speak to Phyllis. -Don't you dare! I wouldn't think of accusing Phyllis. You're positive he didn't come in this evening? Thank you. Try the depot. Maybe there's another train. Hey, Jo, if they were in the 8 o' clock, they'd be here by now. Where are they, Jo? Let's all go over to my place, shall we? -Your place? -Why your house? Well... There's a later train, doesn't father? I'll check with the station about the next eastbound. -What time is the next train due? -Eastboud or westbound? Eastbound is due at 9:03. -It's the last train tonight. -Thank you. 9:03 and that's the last train tonight. He's gotta be on that train. He's gotta be, Miss Katie. You meet that train. Oh, he'd never come with me. He'd probably not even talk to me. Oh, Phyllis, why did I say such terrible things to him? He's such a wonderful man! Call me a cab. I'll get this wonderful man here even if I have to hold him tight! Phyllis! What about collecting the rest of the empties for me? Oh, yes, sir! -Hello! -I may talk to Phyllis? -You mean Phyllis, the cook? -I mean Phyllis, Phyllis... the woman who's giving the surprise party for the three kids. Just a minute, I'll call her. Phyllis, can't come to the phone right now. I'll take the message. I wanna talk to Phyllis. I told you she asked me to take the message. I'll take my own messages if you don't mind, Miss Fenster. Hello Mr. Cab Driver man, you still there? Whom am I talking to now? This is Phyllis, but I ain't do no more talking until that certain party get off the phone. I don't like eavesdropping on my private conversations! Miss Katie! Miss Katie! I thought I heard Miss Katie's voice. You know, Phyllis, I was thinking exactly the same thing. -Phyllis! -Shh! Hello! -Why did you hang upon me for? -I didn't hang up on nobody. -Isn't this Phyllis? -Yes, this is Phyllis. Who's this? The cab driver. Oh, I was gonna call you. Pick me up right away. I gotta meet the 9:03. The 9:03 is pulling right now. Hello! Hello! Hello! The dame is paddy! All right, kids. Get in. I give up! -Where are we going now? -Back to your house. Mr. Jordan! That's him! They ate nuttier than their mother. -Hello, Mr. Jordan. -Hello! Mom's home. Oh, why should she left you alone at this time of the night? We're not alone. We're with that cab driver. -Come on! We'll take you home. -Not tonight. Zoe, I have something that belongs to you. Presents? Pandy! Oh, daddy! But, Zoe... You're better alone. We're sorry how we acted in the Grand Canyon. -Aren't we, Charlie? -Yeah! We really think we are. Now, will you come with us? Some other time maybe. Good night. Please come with us! If you don't, something terrible might happen to mom. -What you mean? -Well... Dr. Wilson said she has crying sinus. Yes, she cried in the train all the way home. -Not all the way. -Yes, she did. Tonight, Aunt Jo sent in for the doctor. She's got a temperature too. And she can hardly breathe. -You got to come with us. -You just got to! -Please, daddy! -Please! Did a man and a woman with three children get off the 9:03? No, mam. I didn't see any woman with kids. Just men and women with men. Did you recognize any of them? No. All srangers to me. Travel men mostly, bowties. Thank you. Well, no sense staying around here without the honored guests. I thought we were going to eat. Yes! As long as we've started the party, we might as well finish it. But if Katie's here, why would she hide? She doesn't want us to know they're separated. That's why! If you come upstairs with me, I'll prove it to you. Oh! Nonsense! -Close the doors, Phyllis. -Yes. Jo! -Katie! It's you! -How do you feel? Get out there quickly before that Fenster witch bitch will do the punch. Tell them that Grant was delayed on business that will keep him till tomorrow and by tomorrow I'll think of something good. Why don't you tell he fell down the Grand Canyon and broke his leg like Miss Jo? Tell them he was delayed on business. Go on! Oh, Jo! I'm afraid it's too late for lies. I'm just gonna tell them the truth. Oh, no! Grant! Hey! They're here! Where's Katie? Where's Katie? Where's Katie? The cab driver didn't have change for a 20, so I told him to come back again tomorrow. # Happy homecoming to you! Happy homecoming to you! # # Happy homecoming, dear Katie! Dear Katie and Grant! # -Good night. -Good night, Minna dear. -Good night. -Good night, Doctor. Good night. -We'll take good care of Jo. -Thank you. -Good night. -Good night, Jo. Good night, darling. Thanks for everything. You lucky girl! Be careful! -What you mean they're separated? -They're just putting on an act! Just wait and see! I wish you'd work as hard for a single man. But, you'll have to work pretty fast. Do you realize that next month you'll be 29? Again! Transcription: Rosita McCartney Subtitling and Sync: Walter Santos
