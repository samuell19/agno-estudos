We're so different from each other. And I was thinking how can we be friends for so many years and be so different? And then I realized what it is is that we complement each other. You know, it's not that you need to be the same, it's just that you need to fit in some weird way. John and me have known each other since 1963. 47 years. It's kind of miraculous. You don't know why it is you're continually coming back to this person or this person is coming back to you. You know, why it is that there's this thing goin' on, you know, over time. Over a lifetime. "Dear John, it's very strange, the effects of time on everything. It's hard to see where I stand, how old I really am. I think about you a lot. How come, out of all the people I've come across in this life that you and me somehow hit it off as partners? I've always set myself up as a great enemy of sentimentality, but now I see that time brings a certain yearning towards past experiences. Your friend, Sam." "Dear Sam, on this particular morning there was a slight breeze blowing at 4:15. I parked my car in the usual spot away from the main parking area and walked across the lot. There would be no discussions this morning about the universe, history, anthropology, Gilbert and Sullivan, Fred Astaire or "Dante's Inferno." There would be no talk about consciousness, presence, self-insight, or the doctrines of no mind. But there would be endless tales of drunken parties, unfaithful husbands and babies' diarrhea, all in Spanish." So how much is the donut? You have to do that to sell me a donut? Shh, wait a second. What was your first job, dogcatcher? No, my first job was a lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey. And then a massage therapist, truck driver, bookstore clerk, dogcatcher, veterinary assistant. Right. This was after he got stitched up here. And here he-- Here he is functioning. Oh, God. He's back in, in the, in the rest home. They're doing quite well. At one point, I sent him a letter and he wrote back to me, which I have. And he said I was sitting in a restaurant and I read your letter and it was so funny I laughed out loud. I couldn't stop laughing and people were turning around looking at this guy who was sitting all alone laughing out loud. And I just had this letter. And I looked at this letter and thought, you know, this is fantastic, this thing between us. We've been writing since the '70s, you know, and all the things that have happened and we've been very intimate talking about our lives and our fears and our hopes and our problems and putting them in letters, you know. We probably should go ahead with this thing in Texas. It's collected letters from over a span of about 40 years. So right now I'm down here because Johnny lives in Deming and I'm collecting these letters and taking them on to Austin, Texas in San Marcos to hand over the letters to Texas State and to make a deal to make a book out of these letters plus his photographs with UT Press. So that's what I'm looking to do just to make some bread, since the TV deal fell through I got no money coming in, etcetera, okay? So that's where I'm going to just try to, you know, pay the rent. His archives are in Texas, and what happened was that in going through all his material, they came across letters of mine and they said would I be willing to donate our correspondence, or my half of the correspondence to the archives? So I called Sam and I said these people want to do this thing with the letters, our correspondence, put it together, or present it in some way, do something with it. What do you think? And he said, "No, I'm not interested," and that was the end of it. - Oh, God. - Let me see those. Come on, just give me one. Just one. And the reason he said no initially was because he was still with Jessica when he said no. He just split with his wife, right? After something like 26 years. That created a completely new energy and things started moving in a different direction, which never could have moved in that direction if he was still married. I think long-term relationships are tricky because you're absorbed by the relationship rather than remaining an individual. Something is lost in recognizing and actually sensing yourself in the relationship and you become a couple, you know. You lose a certain edge to produce what you do. Writing, for instance, because it's more solo. It is solo. Here's one, here's one from '83. '83? Yeah, I think it's-- yeah, it's '83. Look at this thing. Jesus Christ. How are they going to copy this? 1980? What does it say? This should be good. "8:00 a.m., I'm sitting in your big leather chair." And you can't do a thing about it. "I spent the morning at St. Elmo's, and the afternoon in bed. I'm still sick, listening to our last tape about the Squeamish Indians." - The what? - The Squeamish Indians. It's this format it's in, you idiot. This is going to have to be proofread. No, just leave it like it is. No, it's going be, have to be-- they can't put squeamish! Lord have mercy. This is just overwhelming. I think we need an assistant. We need an assistant. I thought you were getting an assistant. Here's a letter from Jack Kerouac. A postcard. Kerouac used to do this thing called sketching. You know, just walking around the city writing little sketches of things he would see in a store window, for instance, or a description of a diner. What I'm hoping for when I write is I always hope to turn whoever's reading it on to the excitement of the small events, like taking the dog for a walk. All the shit that you thought, you know, feelings that you had, associations that triggered other feelings. And how much attention you were paying to what you were doing. The whole idea of hey, you can write in the first person and you can just riff off of whatever is happening to you at the moment. Or what happened to you this past week. And you can write it in such a way that it will be interesting for somebody else to read. Many times, impulses or ideas, or whatever you want to call them, are kind of shotgunned all over the place. Rather than say, oh, I don't want to do that because it doesn't pertain to the exact material that I'm working on, for instance, if I'm working on this play, I just write it all, you know. And then I find out where it fits. What I'm working on in general is this play, and right now it's called "A Particle of Dread," which is a line from Oedipus Rex. This is a notebook that I've carried for some time. This one is New York, Kentucky, Mexico, Sicily, Texas, New Mexico, Los Angeles... '09 to '10. And then as you type it up, you reinvent it, and all of a sudden something sparks and you go off on a tangent and the tangent is sometimes more interesting than the body of stuff that you had started out with. So, it's a process, and plus, um, I love putting it on plain white paper. It's a little more intelligible to me than scrounging around in these notebooks, you know. You know, I started writing letters, wildly writing letters when I was at camp. I must have been about 10 years old. And even at 10 years old I was making carbon, I was writing through carbon paper, making carbon copies of the letters I was writing. For my 13th birthday, my mother bought me a filing cabinet as a present. I've always archived everything. I don't know why. It was just a compulsion that showed up and it was enjoyable, but I was also compelled to do it. I had the loose letters. I never threw the original letters away and then I found them and I thought wow, I've got all these letters, it would be fun to spread 'em out and make a binder of 'em. This is what I was telling you about. These three boxes are all photos. These are albums that go back to the '50s. I mean, it's just incredible. These are all photographs and that top shelf is all writing. And each one's divided up into categories. And these are all the received letters. This is from the kid I worked with in the deli. He went off into the Army-- to the Navy. He's joined the Navy and he's writing to me from basic training. So these are just all people, really, books of people. ♪ Buckets of rain, buckets of tears ♪ You've been singing all that stuff. ♪ Buckets of rain coming out of my ears ♪ ♪ Buckets of moonbeams And every once in a while you go from C to sharp minor. C7, F, G, C. Make it simple. But you know, some great verses like... ♪ I've been meek, hard like an oak ♪ ♪ Seen pretty people going up like smoke ♪ ♪ Friends will arrive, friends will disappear ♪ ♪ If you want me, honey baby, I'll be here. ♪ That's a good verse! You remember the one, how about the one where he says you start out standing proud to give her anything-- proud to steal her anything she sees, you wind up peeking through a keyhole down upon your knees. That's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, he was okay for a little guy. ♪ Buckets of rain, buckets of tears ♪ ♪ Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears ♪ ♪ Buckets of moonbeams in my hand ♪ ♪ You got all the love, honey baby, I can stand ♪ ♪ I been meek and hard like an oak ♪ ♪ I seen pretty people disappear like smoke ♪ ♪ Friends will arrive, friends will disappear ♪ ♪ If you want me, honey baby, I'll be here. ♪ He loves moving. He never stops moving, traveling. Setting up things so that he can go to the next thing, and after that going to the next thing. And he has all these contacts with different people that he knows. And I'm exactly the opposite. And I hate leaving the house. I just like being home. I have everything I want here. And I don't drink and I don't like to go to bars and I don't, I don't like knowing people. Peripatetic I think is the name for it, moving constantly. I never set out to be like that. I didn't know that was going to be kind of the form that my life took. I feel rootless, I do, but I don't mind feeling that way. Because I think I am rootless, essentially. We're coming up on the town where my dad was killed. It's called Bernalillo. It's got these real high sidewalk curbs that date way back because there was so much mud in the town. And they're very high. Some of them are like three foot above the road level. And he came out of this bar backwards a little bit, well, more than a little bit, he was drunk, and he spilled off this sidewalk into the road and a car hit him. He was 67, and I'm 66. Isn't that weird? We went to visit his father. His father was an alcoholic so his father had made a curtain. You how they have beaded curtains and you walk through? He had made a beaded curtain but it was made entirely of beer can tops. And there's a movie of his father showing this curtain to Sam and you can see the tension between them. You can see the relationship, it's just so amazing, and Sam's father said, "I like that hat you got there, that cowboy hat you got there," and Sam said, "Oh, would you like it?" and he gave it to him, so in the movie he's wearing the hat. All this iconic stuff going on. Very King Lear-ish, you know. Well, you know, he spoke fluent Spanish and he was a Fulbright Scholar. And he loved Latin American literature, and I think I picked up some of that. And he had a real short fuse and a horrible temper, which I think I probably inherited as well, and I'm always sort of a little bit scared of it, you know. Both his father and my father were very kind of overbearing and critical and hard. First of all, my old man was right. I was very lazy. I could see that, and it felt good, but I could see it was true. But it was always said as a real negative thing. I can do a perfect imitation of my father and you can get a sense of what he was like. Now let me ask you something. Are you going to sit there and tell me that you can't find a job in this town? If you get a goddamn haircut& You know, he would just go on and on. I didn't turn out to be one of those kids that looks up to his father and wants to imitate his father and wants to follow in his father's footsteps. There wasn't any alternative until the beatniks showed up. Now we're working on this book of letters and stuff, me and Johnny, and archives and all that shit. And I'm kind of forced to go through material from the past, you know, and there's photographs mixed up through it, I mean, from way back, you know. And you can't help but come across photographs of people who are now no longer with us, you know. And I think a photograph, in many ways, is much, much more powerful than the writing. When I'm looking at the letters, I mean, some of the letters have something of that in 'em, but a photograph is right now, you know, you are delivered this emotional& It's like music, you know. The way we met is really funny. They were putting on plays, so this was like off-off-Broadway theater in the '60s. And we went to see this crazy play, you know. And I hate live theater. But we went to this thing and it was some crazy play where at the end of the play, the whole theater filled with smoke. Smoke started coming out and it just filled the entire audience. And as we were leaving, somebody pointed out the kid that wrote the play. Oh, that's the kid over there. Some scruffy looking kid in a long overcoat. He's probably about 24 years old. So the next morning I was in a drugstore and I see this kid, standing there, so I went over to him and I started talking to him. I said hey, I saw your play last night. I was curious what drug you wrote it on. And we started talking and we immediately hit it off. There was no-- a lot of times when you meet somebody, one person is sort of holding back and they're guarding their ego and there's a tension. There was like a very relaxed, unpretentious quality about him. So we walked back to where I was living and we sat down on the stoop and we started talking, and I said where are you from? California, you know. No kidding, California. Where are you from? Jersey City. What was your room like as a kid? Oh, man, I had airplanes hanging from the ceiling. What was your room like? I mean, I had dog pictures all over the walls, and dog statues and dog genealogy charts, and it used to drive my old man nuts. He would come in and, "Get all this dog stuff off the walls, for crying out loud!" He'd say, my father, my father was an alcoholic, you know, and he broke the door down and he used to have me doing all these chores and he was completely crazy. So we were telling stories about our fathers, which was really interesting. Here we are being, suddenly from meeting and presenting ourselves as ourselves, suddenly we're the sons, now we're talking as sons. And we're just sons right now. So I said. "Hey, listen, I just started living with this woman, she's got two daughters. I'm going to make spaghetti tonight. Why don't you come over for dinner?" He said, "Oh, okay, far out." So I ended up marrying the woman, and he ended up marrying one of the daughters. So we were related for like a long time, for like about 13 years. Let me ask the obvious question that I think anybody is interested in, and that is how did you become a playwright in the first place? Uh, that's a very strange question. You know, you find yourself doing certain things. I don't know how I ever began writing plays. I certainly didn't decide to. I just found myself writing them. I was working in Connecticut, and it was the winter, and I was working in a dog pound and I was hosing out one of the runs, and the sun was just coming up, and I remember hosing down this run, and I was thinking, boy, I would never want to be a famous person. You know, I just thought I don't have what it takes and it doesn't seem like it would be enjoyable. But what does seem enjoyable is to be like the best friend of a famous person, so you can sort of come and go, you know. You could just take some of the benefits from being around a famous person and then leave and not have to drag it with you. All right. - Inner sanctum. - We're sneaking up... - ...is what we're doing. - Because of the dog? - Yeah. - When we open it up, I'll just give you a random selection of stuff. But it's-- it's huge. And not to mention all his photographs too. Yeah. There's just a sampling of that. But there's all of them. He saved every single letter... - ...that I wrote him. - I'm sure of it, yeah. Now I didn't save every one of his, but... Hi, Daisy! How are you? All right. This thing here is probably the first thing to look at. That's all my letters that he collected, plus some of his photographs. These are all his postcards. That one is with the Texas Rangers. These are, these are his letters that are loose. - Wow. - Okay. So these go with that. So, these are-- Those are-- Okay, I've got it. Anyhow. But this is from 1973... ...through 2010. - Wow. - All this. Well, it's a nice clean collection in that way. I mean, that's just fantastic. And it covers a lot of ground in terms of the writing too, because there's a lot of discussion about the plays and prose and writing in general, and you know, I mean, he's a Kerouac fanatic. The easiest thing for us, which, you know, is if you and Johnny came in and said here it is, here's what we'd like, you know. Well, John, John lives in Deming, New Mexico. He works in a Mexican deli. He has two dogs and he lives in a little bitty house. And he can't even afford to come up to Santa Fe and work on this thing with me, because he can't-- You know what I'm saying? You know, it's not-- I'm not negotiating just for myself, I'm kind of, I'm kind of looking out for him. - Let me ask you this. - Katie, is it possible to get just kind of a rough count, just numbers? Yeah. This is his way of writing. He's a writer, but he wants to document& I think he's actually an archivist. Exactly. - You're not. He is. - That's exactly right. Me and O-Lan went to London right after Jesse was born and then came back and went to California and joined up with John and Scarlett in San Francisco in '73. And we all started living together and we all got along. It's a mother and daughter. It's an interesting experiment. And we had a little girl too and a dog. So we were all getting along and then we moved from that house eventually to a house on the hill, and from the house on the hill we moved to a little ranch house on a mountain. With horses, and there was a riding stable and everything. And at that point I think Sam started doing movies. Yeah, he started doing movies up there. It just felt normal for the family to be together. You know, Sam would come in and say, "Hey, I'm taking everybody out to dinner. I just bought a house for us all." Everything was a "us." And I thought this is amazing to be in a family with this other guy who feels like it's a family and who is acting like it is. You know, sometimes Sam and I would spend whole days in his bedroom. He'd be lying on the bed like this and I'd be standing against the wall. We would just have the greatest time, you know, making up stuff and talking and laughing. You know, we were just young guys. It was great. We were both stoned. It was summer. Nobody was working. The women were in the other room. Somebody was baking a pie. Jesse was playing with his truck on the floor. You know, it's great little scenes like that. Great moments. You know, if I looked around in my life at somebody I could talk to about literature, famous writers, and both of us never really went to college and everything we picked up, we picked up from books. He was the only one around who I could have those conversations with. Sam, let me, let me say one thing. You know, whoever buys the collection may also hope that they also would be a part of the publishing of the book. I mean, the priority is selling the archive. - Yeah. - The book of course it most interesting to us - because we can fool with how it's composed. - Of course, yeah. - I mean, look at this. - This is unbelievable. The Elite Barber Shop? I once went in there to try to get a haircut and the guy kicked me out. Well, we signed a contract. I think we're getting $250,000 apiece for... donating or selling all these, all these artifacts to the Sam Shepard Archives... which included all my movies and all my tapes and photographs and all our letters, you know. I thought I could, you know, if I was real careful I could maybe live on that in some way for the rest of my life. I didn't want to risk it with like investing it and I didn't want to just live off it as cash. I thought it would be safer to buy a couple of annuities and just get a regular monthly income without having to go to work. Because this is what I do. You know, I take a walk. Maybe I'd be taking a bath by now. Ahh! Yow! Oh, my God. Oh God, that's wonderful. It's amazing how self-contained he is. He appears to not need anybody else whatsoever. He has his two dogs. He plays a little bit of piano. He takes walks. He knows everybody in that town and everybody likes him, but he could care less whether they invite him over to his house or whether he has any friends. He doesn't have any friends. He doesn't want any friends. He's completely hermetic. It's a very sensuous experience. It's not a lifestyle, it's just who he is. He's not designing anything. If this was the 1800s, I wouldn't be shaving. I remember this guy told me once everything counts. That's profound, isn't it? Shaving counts. I thought I had done my level best. Done everything I possibly could not to become my father. Gone out of my way in every department. Changed my name, first and last. Falsified my birth certificate. Deliberately walked and swung my arms in exact counterpoint to the way he had. Picked out clothing the opposite of what he would have worn, right down to the underwear. Spoke without any trace of a Midwestern twang. Never kicked a dog in the ribs. Never lost my temper over inanimate objects. Never again listened to Bing Crosby after the Christmas of 1959. And never, ever hit a woman in the face. I thought I had come a long way in reshaping my total persona. I had absolutely no idea who I was, but I knew for sure I wasn't him. Then in the fall of '75, I discovered a bottle of Hornitos Tequila, pure white, green label. I just stumbled across it like you do some women. Oh, look! Yay! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ I like the sense of being able to alter your state. You have the illusion that you're connected to other people in some strange way. It's easier to talk. It's easier to feel as though you're human, and that you have a human connection. I mean, many times I feel as though I'm completely separate. Completely separate. Desperately separate, you know. And booze is one of the ways in which you feel, or it at least gives you the illusion of being able to talk. Being able to... ...make a connection. "John, I think you're really onto something with this happiness thing. That somehow the gauge for how you're doing in this life has to be around happiness. Otherwise, what the hell's the point? There must be an art to aging and dying, just like there is to growing up and living. It seems overwhelmingly sad sometimes, how ill equipped we are to face the truth and how unprepared. I still wonder how to keep being in the moment, here and now, and why it evaporates into daydreaming and yearning and lusting after some image of reality elsewhere. Your old compadre, Sam." I feel like I'm about 80 years old right now. Do I look 80? I can't remember what year it was. I suppose it had to have been somewhere in the '80s. They were doing a production of "Buried Child" here, and my dad thought he would go see the production, having had his quota of whiskey for the day. And he walked into the theater, sat down with the audience, and as the play progressed and the story kind of evolved, he started yelling at the actors in the middle of the audience and telling them in no uncertain terms that this was not the truth, this was not the way it was. Anyway, long story short, the ushers came up and escorted him out of the theater. That play was never intended to be a piece of realism. I just used elements of the family to fabricate this thing, you know. There were elements of the truth in it, but I didn't give a shit about the truth. And I still don't. He's got some themes that continually show up. There was a whole period of time where he was just endlessly writing about his father. And the plays always had two brothers in it. And one was obviously the good brother, and one was the bad brother, and they were constantly at odds with each other. And I always took that to mean the war that was going on in himself, between these two sides of himself. But outwardly, they also resembled a lot of the stuff we were doing together. So maybe it was a combination of both those things. I mean, it's an old, old tradition that goes way back into almost a kind of a religious knowledge, you know, that there's this other, that there's this companion. The obvious one is the brothers, the counterpart, the shadow. There's some sense of another being that accompanies you. Whether that being is for you or against you is up in the air. I was just talking to a guy today-- I guess this is one of the reasons that this institute exists is this cross dialogue thing-- where he gave me an example, there are two eggs and you examine the two eggs and they might be different in certain minor respects, like one has more bumps and the one's a different color, etcetera, slightly different size. And then, if you break the eggs, you can't begin to number the different ways that the broken eggs will have diversity, as opposed to the whole egg. That example relates to a brokenness in one's emotional and psychological life. Not just physical. That there can be a brokenness that goes on and on and on, creating more and more internal and external chaos in your life, even though you're struggling all the time to put it into form. Okeydoke. Those pictures give me so much consolation when I look at them. It's like they represent a whole part of me that I really like. Writing and drugs are synonymous for me, they always have been. So, if I'm going to write, I get stoned, and if I get stoned, I'm inevitably drawn to sitting down and writing something. I'll tell you how I've described myself in my writings. Chasing women, taking drugs, stealing and writing. Now, if we were on our way to visit somebody and I said he's a nice guy. He's a nice guy. I mean, he's into stealing and drugs and chasing women, but he's like, he loves to write. You'll like him. You know, you'd have mixed feelings. You'd think, Jesus, this guy sounds really strange. I never could connect to any-- people would say, "What're you going to do? What do you want to be?" and I never could connect with it, but two things I knew I had to find were the perfect true love and a perfect friendship. That's the library. Library. That's the conference room. Driving up to Santa Fe, I got to about Hatch and I got some kind of anxiety attack. It's not like a bad thing, it's not a good thing. It's just what happens. You're stepping into Sam's world. The thing is, that it's his stage. It's not my stage, so I'm walking into a strange situation. There's the letters. Oh, man. - In that box. - All right. - So you have this desk. - I have a desk? - All to yourself. - Do I have a dog? We'll get you a dog. You have a typewriter. I have to get a cup of tea. - Do you want a cup of tea? No? - No, not right now. These are the hash cookies. Oh, you can go out there. I could go out there and smoke. This doesn't open. "Don't leave the doors open." Oh, there it is. It's getting harder and harder to leave the house... leave Deming. Okay. I don't want to get you in trouble. You won't get me in trouble. Here are the copies of the pictures, oh yes. I should call that woman and, uh& Oh, these look great in color, you know. - You know, this is yellow. - Yeah. Yeah. We don't have to worry about the color now. We're just-- it's where they go. Are you going to bust into that box? Yeah. Um, she even put... What's this? I don't know what you do with that thing. You must plug it into something. And it's an electronic... Okay, if anything of importance is said, I will record it. I have no doubt you will. Okay, so, how does she know? And they're all chronologically done. Well, what do you mean? I don't have dates on them. Yeah, I know. That's because you fucked up. Wait a second. Oh, God, this is so suddenly daunting. Oh, my God. Yeah, this is yours. But there's no year on it. Another one of yours that has no date on it. Here's one from '82. Oh, my God. And you know what might be handy is if you numbered the fucking pages, you know. - Number them. - Number 'em. In case, you know. I mean, numbering and dating might be handy in this situation. Not always, but in this situation, perhaps. Seven things that I learned from you. "Have three bites and push your plate away. Eat whenever the fuck you feel like it, even if it's five minutes before dinner." "Try to get someone else to wash your underwear. Keep driving even if you forget where you're going." "Six. Never stay more than thirty seconds once you realize you don't want to be there." And seven, "Spend all your money and then get some more." That's what I learned. Oh, this is a cool letter here. I remember this one. I read this one. It's pretty cool. That's one of my letters you read? Here I was meeting this older woman with two kids and a mother. They're all living in an apartment. And she basically says I'll just go wherever you go and do whatever you do, whatever you want to do. I'd never experienced love with anybody else other than Scarlett. I mean real love. And I always thought it was really lucky if it happened once. With Scarlett, I always had the feeling that we both were able to find our place. I'm a male and I'm in a marriage and I have to find my place in that. That's truth, based on who I am. And she has to find her place in the thing. And we weren't burdened by all these notions from the culture. And a lot of times it would be what does she need from me? And then there were other times when I'd need her to help me get through a situation. It was nice finding that balance. They absolutely needed each other. They were absolutely tied in some way that I think was very unusual, you know. I mean, yeah, you don't often see couples like that that are so interconnected. We were all living, Sam, O-Lan, Jesse, Scarlett, we were all living in Mill Valley in California. And one morning, Jesse and Sam and myself went out on a bike ride, and there was nobody in the house except Scarlett. And when we came back, a neighbor kid stopped us in the street and said there was just an ambulance at your house and they took this lady away. And we went in and Scarlett was gone. So we raced off to the hospital without having any idea what had happened. And we got there and she was in a cubicle and they didn't know what was wrong with her. And it was an artery in her brain that had ruptured. They called in a local brain surgeon and they were conferring and they said that she needs an operation and that the artery had burst in her brain, it was a major artery. And when you're in that situation and it's actually happening, it's like very scary. I mean, you're going, this just happened, we were just out for a bike ride and your whole world has just turned a corner completely. The night before, they shaved her head and I was home and woke up the next morning knowing that at that moment she was being wheeled in for this major brain operation. You know, it was like very, just strange. Sam was a big help. Everybody was a big help-- Jesse, O-Lan. - Do you have any Jacks? - Scarle No. There's nothing to cry about. It was a really arduous time. Tough on everybody. And, of course, extremely tough on her, because for a while she had lost everything. She had lost language, she lost a certain kind of dexterity, and a certain fundamental sense of who she was. And she didn't recognize anybody in the family. She didn't recognize herself. It was a real lost-ness, you know. And so we built this thing around her where she began to re-identify herself. They all did some particular thing, you know. Sam immediately supplied money to buy a cot and whatever was needed. And we would sit down and have meetings about what we were going to do and how we were going to watch her, how we were going to take care of her, what kind of medication schedule we were going to keep her on, because they suggested her going into a home of some sort to be looked after. And we said no, we can do it at home. We'll do it at home. So we worked out a program among ourselves, among O-Lan and Sam and everybody took turns and looked after her. But we had no idea what we were in store for because as the brain was healing, she went through a complete exorcism. She was hallucinating and screaming and if you tried to bring her something, she would scratch your arm and fight you and hit you and she would just freak out. And she went through all these different stages as she was recovering. She turned into a child, you know, really. And she was just crying to break your heart. Scarlett and Sam were great to watch together, absolutely great. He just softened and melted and he was so concerned with her. And she was so glad to see him after not seeing him for so long. And he would look at her and laugh and he'd say, "How are you doing? Look at you!" And they were just, you know, really tender with each other. It was really nice. And then she would get very serious and ask him questions about his life. You know, she would never judge him or anything. She would just ask him what he was doing and I think he really appreciated her. He was probably more relaxed with her than he was with me. Do you remember there was a Robert Mitchum movie where he had love and hate on his knuckles? - Yes. - Do you remember that? Yes, I do. L-O-V-E, and H-A-T-E. After a while, it just became a way of life. We had this woman who was sick in the house. It brought us closer together as a family, initially. Tremendously. And that lasted for a short while. You know, for about a year. She never completely recovered. It was like just a very short time where I panicked a little bit because I was still holding on to the woman that I had met originally. And I didn't want to lose that. It was just an instinctual thing of holding on. But I mean, somebody could have told me let go, this is much better! You're with a much better person. This person is almost like enlightened. And then I heard that Sam wrote a play about a woman that had a brain hemorrhage, but I never saw that play. I don't know anything about it. ♪ As long as you stand ♪ Stand by me. Remember that Stones song, "Time Is On My Side"? ♪ Time is on my side ♪ Yes, it is. Hey, Peter, how you doin'? My dogs would love it here, running around. Wow. So, let me show you your bedroom. It has a television. - Holy shit. - It has a bed. - Look at that, it has a television? - Yeah, it has a remote control. - Television, you say? - This is the television. And then, that's the remote control. - You know that, don't you? - Books. Oh, this is nice. Yeah, cozy. As you can see, it's not much of a bath. But I don't want you in there in the morning. - No, no. Yeah, I got to brush my teeth! It looks like it's cold at night, huh? No. You've got the warmest room in the house. If I hear you whine about the cold, I'm going to kick your ass out. You've got to prime this thing pretty good because it smokes like crazy. "Dear John, it was ten years ago to the day, St. Patty's, that we sat in that pancake house in San Rafael. You know, I was completely strung out about whether to go or to stay. And you suggested that I might as well go." It was just two guys sitting on a wall and one guy's saying I met this blonde and I'm like insane mad for her and I want to run off. And I'm sitting there saying yeah, you should run off with her, it sounds great. You're mad for her. If you stay here, you're going to tear yourself to pieces. You know, go for it. Do it. I mean this went on for a year where he said I want to leave, but I can't abandon my family. I can't leave my son. I can't do it. But I can't live without her, I just can't live without her. But I can't leave my family. What am I going to do? Maybe I should just kill myself. I don't have any idea what to do. And I was saying, "You don't have to do anything. One day it's just going to happen. You're going to go one way or the other. Something's going to happen, but in the meanwhile, you're going to have this terrible suffering you're going to have to live of being pulled in two different directions." Hey, it's drawing. Usually, this son of a bitch fills the house with smoke. We're supposed to have a brandy. Yeah, I know. I wish we did. I'm going to have to get some of that. He left in the afternoon. Then Scarlett and O-Lan came in and I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, this is unbelievable." And then the phone rang and it was Sam on the phone. She says, "Where are you?" He's being kind of vague, and he's not coming out and saying anything. And she's saying, "When are you coming back?" And he said, "Uh, I don't know." And she said, "Well, how about if I meet you half way?" And his thing was, no, I don't want to get together, I just want to leave everything completely. I'm left. I'm gone already. This is just a courtesy call. I'm out of here. And he went off and started his new life, completely new life. And O-Lan became incredibly protective of Jesse and his feelings. She knew that here's this kid, thirteen years old, who worships his dad, imitates him in every way, and wakes up one morning without any warning and his dad is gone forever, with somebody else. There was a period where O-Lan was very pissed at Sam. She was more pissed at him for what he did to Jesse than what he did to her. I think when he thinks of like a million different incidences in his life, different types of situations, he feels some sense of guilt about them. Are those reading glasses? No. I can't see a thing, actually. "Dear Sam, what great adventures are you into now? Meanwhile, back at the compound, as you know, O-Lan is busy getting her play together. Although, by her own admission, she has never been this busy. I am cleaning Monday, Wednesday and Friday for a few hours and spend the rest of the day with Scarlett. I could not have imagined that we could have grown closer than we were, but this past month or so, our relationship seems to radiate through our skin, not unlike the sensations of one who is first in love. That surprising sweetness, almost childlike, is still with Scarlett and she still sits entranced sometimes for hours while Jesse spins her yarns from school or great football stories. Really, there is no one who does or could sit for such a long wide-eyed time, listening with delight to a little boy. Of course, in the evenings we are all together, the three of us, and I take them to the Upstart Crow. We are a known trio, like some odd, gently floating chemical compound making our way in and out among the tables and the books, but I am, as I promised, looking after him and getting him to wash and make his dinner every night." What are you gonna try and do now exactly? Scarle He's gonna try and grab that bar. You know, you find yourself in a role, or several roles, in your life. In my case, I found it very fulfilling. I thought this is great. I'm a caregiver because my wife is sick and I have to look after her. And also, the relationship that I had with Sam. And when he left, you know, he said look after Jesse. I thought that's great. I'm this guy who's in this role. It's a great role, I really love it. I think the main pain of it was leaving my son at a time when I realized that he was probably most vulnerable in making the transition, of course, from boyhood and manhood and then having his dad up and virtually abandon him. That was the toughest part. I mean, that's what really made me delay so much in running off with Jessica, you know, because I realized the damage that I was causing. So where are we? Jesus, I haven't made very much progress. - Have you? - I'm culling. - I'm getting rid of letters. - Oh, good. Good man. Don't do that anymore! Yeah, that must be annoying as hell. This is what happens when you live alone. - When you live alone... - Just stop doing that. ...you scratch your ass. Wow, that's great. What year did you leave? '85. No. '85? '86? Oh, so what are you doing playing polo in New Mexico in '83? - Explain that. - That's when I first got there. - '83? - Yeah, from-- Sorry. I'll try to die quietly. But you said you didn't leave until '85. It was probably '86. Well, why were you in Santa Fe in '83? I came from Iowa to Santa Fe after shooting "Country." - We came directly down here. - Oh, no, no, I mean, what year did you leave O-Lan? - '83. - '83? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. "Dear John, I'm having a gigantic depression here. I'm full of complaints. My whole being is one big complaint. I don't know what happened. Been reading Beckett's short stuff again, which really hasn't helped my mood. Only reinforced the kind of ornery, curmudgeon loner attitude. I don't know what to do with myself. I'm beyond Eeyore in the self-pity department. I have no friends, I feel alienated from my own family, and yet I don't have any idea what to do or where to go or what the answer is. This is really the pits. Your pal, Sam." I don't love it so much when you get back into stuff that is, um, gives you the blues. And also calls up all kinds of associations about people, places, and things that you don't particularly want to revisit, you know. He called me right after she died. And I had my car parked in New York City on Pier 40, which is kind of a cool place to park because it's outdoors and you look right out over the Hudson and you can see clear to New Jersey, which is funny. That's where he's from. And my conversation with him, I was in the car, so it's kind of like, you know, you're in the car and you're having this dialogue and you're looking at the Hudson going by and you're seeing New Jersey. And, I don't know, the whole thing was... I don't know. It unfolded like a fairytale almost, you know. You know, everybody knew that Scarlett was dying. She'd been dying for years. It was extraordinary she could hang on as long as she did. ♪ Gets me to the end, then ♪ Do it over again. So anyway, here we are. Two men, without women. Well, without those women. And I've always felt his take on women was a little different than mine. If you know anything about his plays, I guess you probably know the place that women have in his dramas. Certainly peripheral characters. I mean, the mother walks in at the end or something. And she's fairly straight. The fuckups in the plays are all men. They're incredible fuckups. They're confused, they're alcoholics, they fight, they hit each other, you know. The women are like somebody waiting in a motel room for you to bring them their magazines and chocolate. They're not really seen as people in the way you see other men. They're vehicles for sex and they can have children and you can get a meal out of them. It's an attitude toward women that is like real old fashioned. Oh, it's not going to be news to you. What? Just some random thoughts about winning. "For myself, I find the experience of winning a lot more unpleasant than losing." You probably already knew that. My life is falling apart. Coming apart at the seams. I can see it. It's just that I continue to make the same mistakes over and over again, which is pretty obvious, but still not enough to prevent me from making them. And I don't quite understand it. You know, I can see that the mistakes and shit that I continue to make are in these letters. Well, I mean, you know, it's probably one of those things where if you have the blues, you can't see past it to the other side of the fence you know, because you're absorbed in the feeling. ♪ I wish I was a mole in the ground ♪ ♪ Wish I was a mole in the ground. ♪ Who are these people? Look at this. This is amazing. Beverly Hills. Oh, Rebecca. Rebecca's been my psychic for two years. If my husband ever leaves me, I'm going with him. He will never emotionally fulfill you, ever. These people are so stupid. Sometimes, people just don't agree, or sometimes they don't stand up for you the way they're supposed to. You know what this is? This is the Kentucky Fried Chicken of entertainment, you know. It's like bad food. There's nothing nutritious about this. ...the problems between Kim and I. What time, what time are we going to eat? What? What are you mumbling about now? He's dying. It's emphysema, I'm telling you. We're going to have to carry him around with fucking oxygen. He's dead. He's down dead. Or he's dead. Oh, that song does it to me every time. Would you stop bitching and whining? Jesus Christ. With friendships, you're encountering what you'd maybe call moods or sides of a person. And you like some sides, but you don't like all the sides. You know them for a long time in a certain way and then all of a sudden these things start getting revealed that are really difficult. You know, once we were at a movie premiere and this woman came over and she said, "Sam!" And she was talking to Sam and then she asked who I was and he introduced me as his bodyguard. Well, it's like you're hired. He's introducing you as someone that belongs to him, that he's paying for. I got the impression that Sam thought I wasn't appreciative enough. I think he probably has a tendency to equate appreciativeness with obedience. You know, I was having a relationship with him for years and years before I realized that the relationship we were having was always on his stage. All the things we do, we usually end up doing in a way that he wants to do it or where he wants to go. And I always thought it was because he just cared more deeply than I did. I feel like he's suffering, you know, and I feel like helpless. I just experience him as being lost. Scarlett used to always say he's very lost. And that's kind of sad in a way. And that doesn't mean he's always like that. Sometimes he's really in great high spirits. But I think he has a really rough time of it. I think he has a much rougher time of it than I do. "John, yesterday, me and Jessica drove into Duluth. I can't describe the feeling I had walking side by side with her down through those streets, knowing this was her hometown and she was a child in this place. And she was describing buildings she remembered and places she grew up in, and here I was with her and we were really together after all those agonizing months of being separated. Inside, my world keeps shifting always. I miss the family and Jesse and O-Lan and all of you guys, sometimes with a terrible sadness that seizes me completely. The thing that..." I can't do this right now. I like solitude, but I also like companionship, you know. But I think that somewhere in between there, is where the modern dilemma is, you know. The dilemma about, the dilemma between men and women is this thing of craving solitude on the one hand and also craving companionship and how to make a balance between the two. It would be great to be able to make a balance. Whether it's possible, I don't know. We have this illusion that we can change ourselves, and it may appear that we change ourselves. You know, we grow a beard, we change our clothes, we change women, we change situations, we become suddenly adventurous, we change our careers, but it's all horseshit. You know, nothing's changing. I mean, nothing's fundamentally changing. You're just changing the costumes and the sets and the dialogue, and it's playwriting. You write your own little play and then you act it out and then you move on and you write another one. But nothing fundamentally is changing. I'd like to know seriously about utter aloneness, you know. When you realize that your aloneness is the essential thing in your life. And that everything you face in terms of death, in terms of relationships with women, with everything, it has to do with this aloneness and so you have to keep returning to it. There's always been a tension connected with being with Sam because he's more of a moody person than I am. And so you never quite knew when something was going to upset him or push him in a certain direction or if he was going to reject everything, but it was in the game that that was going to happen. When I was in Santa Fe, I kept getting these little jabs of criticism. I could feel them going in like little arrows about certain things. And I've never been able to figure out whether he was getting more like that or that I was suddenly noticing something that had always been like that. It just suddenly started affecting me. I've never actually felt that I needed to tell him to get off my back or back off in some way. I mean, it's never come up. If it had, things might have been different a long time ago, but it just never came up. And again, I thought either I'm losing my mind, and it all has to do with me, or he's actually getting worse. Or that this relationship is deteriorating into becoming like his sidekick or something. You know, I felt that he wasn't aware of his behavior. That was my feeling. So I wrote him a letter and one of the things that disturbed him, I think, was in the letter I said, "You're starting to sound just like your old man or like my old man." So one day I come home and there are all these FedEx boxes in front of the door. What the hell is this? I take them inside and they're all from Sam up in Santa Fe. The packages were filled with all the letters and photographs we were going to be using for the book, and in one of the packages was a short note. "Here are all these letters of yours back. I've just realized that I've come to the end of this obsession and long to be free of it. I'm no longer interested in poring over the past, re-making the past, goofing on the past, reminiscing about the past or revisiting the past. I need to move on to my own stuff and leave this behind. It may be some emotional territory I'm going through that has prompted this, in the same way as leaving Jessica, but in any case, this whole phase of things is over and done with for me. Finished. As far as I'm concerned, you can continue in any way you want. You can rewrite all my letters and of course all your letters. You can arrange the stuff any way you want, in any order with or without a date. You can throw in additional dialogue from your book of our conversations. I don't care, be my guest. Take it away, Johnny, and good luck. Sam." I didn't mean for it to be pejorative, I just like said go ahead and take it, and run with it. I don't care. I stopped caring about it. I stopped caring about it as an artistic adventure. I'm not as fascinated by the history as I am what creates the history, whereas John I think is really fascinated by the history and remaking it and reworking it and I can understand his fascination that way, but not for me, you know. Why didn't he just call me up and say, "I don't want to do the book anymore"? You start to wonder about how the other person views the relationship. He should know that's something he could easily say to me. I know like what I can say to him. But I took it as signifying that he had had enough of the past and that I was also part of that past, so that he'd had enough of me. You know, I interpreted it that way. It wouldn't be inconsistent with his behavior if he just disappeared. You know who used to do that was Sinatra. He couldn't be bothered with working the thing out, and talking to the person and explaining it. He'd just snap his fingers and that would be it. You'd be excommunicated. Forget about it. I got to the point where I just thought that's probably the last time I'll ever see him or hear from him, actually. And that just became the new reality. Like life without Scarlett. You know, it becomes the new reality. It'll heal up, it'll blow away in the wind, in the dust. You know, I mean, I realize that what exists between us is stronger than that. But for a while it just left me with a bad taste. I'm glad I got out of it, let's put it that way. And that was essentially it. I just wanted out. I wanted out of the whole& I wanted to get on with my own work and that was the only way I saw how to do it. It becomes really important to find out what it is to see. To perceive. What it is to hear. Do I ever hear? ♪ He was a friend of mine ♪ He was a friend of mine ♪ Every time I think about him now ♪ ♪ Lord, I just can't keep from cryin' ♪ ♪ 'Cause he was a friend of mine... ♪ You know, I have these little awakenings to my own situation. That happens periodically with different things. With relationships, for instance. Or what my own situation is or what my own talents are, suddenly like have this moment when you're suddenly aware of exactly what they are. They're not the thing that you'd been imagining they were or these people aren't the people that you were imagining they were. Once you wake up to something, you're up. You're a certain way or that you react a certain way or that somebody pushes your buttons. You're suddenly aware of that, and you know, what happens next? ♪ He was a friend of mine ♪ He was a friend of mine ♪ Every time I hear his name... ♪ I have nothing against relationships. I think they're fantastic and they're deep, but they can also protect you in a certain way from this vulnerability toward your aloneness. They can kind of build a smokescreen between you and the fire that's causing your work to happen. You don't go at the thing that you're meant to go at, that you know you're destined for, you know. The last time I saw Sam I guess was Santa Fe, which would have been a year ago? Probably a year ago. This is the last word that I got. It's a letter from Sam. "Talked to Wittliff yesterday about the book and it still seems way off from publishing. Don't know why there's so much red tape in Texas." And then he says, "I'll try to get down there to Deming before too long and pay you a visit. Like you, it's now a dog problem." Because he got another dog. You know how everything changes all the time, I mean, like you're aging. There's definitely a period in our lives where we're all living together. And we're in our 30s and there's a kind of "being 30" energy about everything. And we're buying motorcycles and riding around and just being young guys. And there's also a period where it was sort of the golden age of letter writing, which is what prompted the Texas Press to want to do this book about our letters. But those times are pretty much over, I think. Those were peak experiences with activities and letters and now that's pretty much in the past. I'm very interested in this thing about destiny and fate. This notion that you don't know that you've wreaked havoc and devastation on the people around you, and that you are the culprit, which is the basic theme of "Oedipus," you know. You can't even bring yourself to conceive that the things that you've done have been enacted by you. We're in this trance. We don't see ourselves. We don't know who we are. And that's the way I feel about my life, that I've gone through all of these things having hurt people. And it's not something you go to somebody and you lay on a couch and you talk about the Oedipus Complex. I find destiny and fate far more plausible than all this psychological stuff. You know, he's got a very strong redneck reaction against analyzing and getting too mental. I mean, there might be fate, I don't know. But I also think when he talks about it, there's an element of letting himself off the hook for his behavior. The thing is, that by becoming more aware, more conscious of who you are and the subtle manifestations that have always been invisible to you, and which are probably not so invisible to everybody else, that your life can change. "Dear Sam, got your letter, and yes, I puzzle over the same fate that befell us. First being in one life, and then suddenly in another. Hardly ever seeing each other, speaking, or writing. I think we achieved a kind of openness of communication between each other when we were stoned or drunk, which we seldom-equaled straight. I too always hoped after you left that each time we met we'd fall back into those great states. One day we will be able to meet in some neutral place and just amble around, digging things and each other the way we used to do because my feelings for you, my admiration, love, remains intact, in spite of limitations of time and situation. So, regardless of how long, I'll never let us lose touch.
