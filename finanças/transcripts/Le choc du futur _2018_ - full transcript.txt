What's this shitty music? Let's go. Your coffee's really disgusting, babe... Plus it's cold! Do you have a problem with you answering machine? No. I left you ten messages. You never answer! Oh. I'm sorry. It's just that I worked really late last night. I didn't have time to listen to it. I'm sorry. No but I'm freaking out here! Do you understand that I booked the singer this afternoon, okay? I have to turn in the tape to Quicknails tomorrow morning. - You have to answer me! - Yeah. Yes? Right. So where are we? We are... Where are we...? I can already show you a few things. So let's see... Yes. Shit. No, in fact I totally forgot but the CV of my sequencer is totally out for some reason. Wait. Honey. I'm sorry. Speak in English because I really don't give a crap about your airplane pilot bullshit. So what's the problem? Well the problem is that I have the music, I have tons of ideas. But I have a couple of settings to do and I'd like to wait before I show you. This was Michel's idea, to take a chick to do the music. Okay. Because guys are never late? Exactly. Guys don't have issues. Guys, you tell them: "Give me the tape on thursday" They give the tape on thursday on time! All of a sudden, you want to do a big thing. Hey! Your buttons and shit, I don't get it! It's crazy! I'm sorry. So what are we gonna do? I'm leaving you until the end of afternoon. - Okay. - It'll do? - Yeah, it will do. - Fine. - You'll give me the tape? - Yes! You'll have everything. Okay. See you later. Bye. You won't be late? No. It will be done. Okay. Did I say goodbye? No I didn't. Bye sweetie. See you later. Yeah, see you later. Hey, I'm thinking of something... The artists who succeed are the ones who listen to their answering machine. And who call back so that people won't get nuts! Ten messages! No answer! It's not okay! Okay? It's not complicated. - See you later. - See you later. Hi Ana, it's Clara. You didn't confirm our appointment tomorrow for the commercial. I wanted to know if it was still on. Ana... Hi, it's Duncan. Dominic Giroux, the producer from Barclay Records, is coming to your party. It's a great opportunity to have him listen to your music, okay? Yeah! Hey, it's Jean Mi. You were supposed to send me the tape yesterday! Is everything okay? Ana? Are you there? Ana! Call me back please, it's important. Ana! It's Jean Mi again. Quicknails is harrassing me, call me back because the PR is a cunt, call me back before I start worrying! Ana! What the fuck are you doing? It's Jean-Mi! Call me back! Ana, write a theme that goes forward, grandiloquent but still elegant. What a prick. Quicknails... Quicknails... Shit. What the fuck? Shit! What's this mess? Hello, is this Herve Girard? Michel Maniatovski gave me your number. Yes. Yes, I know he left six months ago, I'm the one who's keeping his flat. Yeah. Well... No, I'm calling because I have a little problem with one of his machines. I was wondering if you could help me? Yeah... If you can come today, it would be perfect! Yeah. Okay. Very good. Very good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. See you later. Bye. - They're you go. It works! - Really? Yeah! Allelluia! Of course it works! Let me make sure... Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You're welcome honey! You're lucky Michel let's you touch his stuff. That's no business for chicks, it costs a lot of dough! - Thanks. - Just kidding. Hey, you got a spliff? Yeah, I must have that somewhere. What's that? Hey. Wait a sec. You're curious, aren't you? I wanna see. Wait, don't touch! Give me a sec. This... ...is a beatbox! Latest from Roland; the CR-78. - Can we try it? - Of course! Give me a second. Do you have an entry somewhere for a jack? - Yeah. - Show me. It's so beautiful. Here... You can take this... Hand me the second one... What about the spliff? Get on with it! No time to loose! They're times when you need to get going! So you're into music? You're a backing singer? No, I do music with all these machines you see. Yeah? So you're crashing at Michel's. Good. When is he back? I don't know... You know he went to an Ashram... He'd be able to stay there. You'll probably inherit the place. I'm telling you. I'm not sure he's gonna come back. - It's awesome! - Yeah. And you can try a lot. - You can play around like this... - Okay... let me see... You can even do breaks. - Here? - Yeah. - It's fucking amazing! - Yeah! You can change your tempo as you like. As it is, it's just a beatbox. But that's not revolutionary yet. Give me a second. You plug it in the sequencer and they're synchronized. No? No need to record, or go back and forth anymore. - You're kidding me? - No! - But it's crazy! - Yeah! It changes everything! - It's unbelievable! - Yeah. I need it. I need it right now! It's awesome! You're funny. It's five thousand. They're only three in Paris and Blanc-Francard took the first one. - Five thousand. That's something. - Yeah. That's something! No but... wait... Wait... wait... I absolutely need it! I'm working on a commercial. I'll be paid in a month and I'll give you the money. - Then you get it in a month. - No! Hey I'm sorry! I've got too many people on line! No! I need this machine now! I'm having a party tonight! The guy from Barclay Records... - Giroux. You know who that is? - Yeah. Well you see, it's really important. I want to show him what I can do. And with this gem I'm going to do amazing stuff with my machines! - It's going to be insane! - Listen... Why should I trust you? I don't know... Well... You could give me a little something... For example... - A kiss... - Excuse me? Just a little one... Or nothing... No, just nothing... You're a friend of Michel. The friends of my friends are apparently not my girlfriends. - So I'll let you have it. - Thank you. - But careful! - I promise... I'll be careful! - No, but seriously... really. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Don't fuck up. - I promise. I'll be careful. - Yeah. - Thank you. That's really great. - Here. My gift. Time to go. - Don't worry. - Yeah. - Thank you Herve. - You're welcome. Ana! Hi darling! - How are you? - Good. And you? So what did you bring for tonight? You're going to see. Awesome stuff! It's going to be fantastic! - Great! Come in. - Yeah. This is a band from London. They're into performance big time. They even screen videos during their shows. Listen to this... They use the noise of the synthetizor to do the snare drum. That's really clever. Yeah. It's special... Yeah. It's great. Yeah. I love it! Okay now wait... Here's a total madman. A Belgian guy. Absolutely fantastic! I'm keeping this. - Aksak Maboul. - Yeah. "Eleven dances to fight headaches" Very promising... The riff of the keyboard is really cool. Listen to this... And now... Something crazy. Totally crazy that comes from New York. I found it at the music store the other day. I never heard anything like it. It sounds like Rock music but in fact... apparently... It's just a guy alone with a machine and a singer. Can you hear the... synthetizor, or whatever he's doing this with? Wow! I'm not into this one. The spoken voice... It's boring! If you want life, you can read the newspaper. No, I'm sorry, it's boring. And it's too "rock", too fifties. No! This record is really important! I think it's fantastic! So wait... What else do you have? - This? - Yeah. How come you know all this stuff? You know, Ana... I've been collecting records for thirty years... I know all the best shops in the world. I'm friends with all the record salesmen, like the guys from "Champs Discs". There's even a new place nearby called "Crocodiscs". "Crocodiscs"? I love that name. But the real paradise for records is Tokyo. It's crazy over there! It's insane! I would love to go there... I don't get why you ended up here. It's deadly isn't it? I ask myself that question eveyday, but... first of all, there are the French girls... And I like Parisians! There's an elegance here... ...a sense of style, that I can't find anywhere else. New York is the end of the world, it's ultra trash! In any case, people tonight won't believe their ears! - Did you get hold of Giroux? - I ran into him at the "Palace" club. He showed interest when I told him cute dancers were coming. So you know, with everything I brought... and what I prepared... we're going to set this party on fire. We better! Cause I invited tons of people! The whole "Gibus" club is coming. So we have to make people dance! By the way, I have a last thing for you... This. This is future. You need to listen to this. You'll see... You're gonna see... This is absolutely incredible! A friend from London sent it to me. He recorded it on the radio. You will see... Incredible! I think these guys are from Sheffield. That's it! That's great! Yeah. Ana... That is exactly what you should do! I need to get back to work! I need to get back to work right now! Hey, are you shitting me? What am I gonna say to the Quicknails bitch? That the musician doesn't want to do the music anymore! Come on! Is it really that hard to play: "Doo, doo doo, doo, doo, doo doo..." I'm sorry! I just can't do it! What do you want me to say? I'm not sure you realize you're putting me in deep shit! I'm not alone in this! Fuck... Okay, you know what I'm gonna do? - Tell me. - Well, watch me. I'm gonna sit right there. Like this. I'm gonna light myself a smoke and I'm gonna wait for you to give me back the one Grand you owe me. There. I'm waiting. Okay. - What's this? - This is a beatbox. A CR-78. Yeah okay. I know what it is! What does it have to do with me? You have music in all the commercials you produce, right? Yeah! And I know what a stupid beatbox is for! Do you think that at some point it's going to replace a drummer? The energy? The sound? You believe they're won't be studios anymore? No more musicians? There's just gonna be this poor guy alone doing music at home with his machine? - Why not? - Yeah. Right. You know the eighties are coming, Jean-Mi. I can tell you the new generation doesn't give a shit about rock music and all the psychedelic bullshit! That shit is over! Let me tell something about rock music... It's going to end up like jazz... In museums! Yeah man! And it will be government funded! They'll only be Bourgeois people to listen to it in their armchairs with their slippers on their feet! But now, something new is happening! A new sound is coming! It comes from England... from Sheffield! That's what you should listen to! You'll see, it changes everything! It's... like... It's like "Kraftwerk meets James Brown", you know? Kraft-what? I don't understand a thing at what you're saying. Have you gone totally nuts? I don't get what you're talking about! But of course! That's it! It's about dancing with atoms! Moving with electronical circuits! It's creating a dance for oscillators! It's like robots creating electronic music but for dancing! Okay... So it means for concerts you think you're gonna get people to come for dancing robots and oscillators! Excuse me! Of course we have to invent new ways to listen to concerts! But exactly! That's where there's something to do... We need to change everything we know! All those crummy and disgusting Rock music concert halls stinking of beer and piss! Enough with all that, we need to open up! We need to get out to meet nature! We need to play in fields! We need to play in the moutains! Near rivers... I don't know! In forest, in water falls, in marvelous places! Do you understand? And there could be an incredible sound system so that people could feel the sound vibrations in their body! to create a real harmony between people on stage and the music you feel vibrating inside you, do you understand? And there could be light projections! I heard people are doing it already and it's fantastic! There would be lasers! There would be smoke! There would be light beams! And so the composer would be like a music director in his spaceship! It would be beautiful! Hey! What the hell are you doing? First of all, I don't understand a thing at what you're saying! Second of all, your dancing robots in the forest and in the fields who will go see them? I don't know where you're going to find an audience for this. Do you understand you're talking nonsense? C'mon, give me back my dough right away. - You don't understand. - Yeah. What I'm gonna do with this instrument is something you've never heard before! That's future! That's what people are waiting for! And I swear that with this I'll be making money! Because this machine is revolutionary! Do you understand? I'll reimburse you! You'll be the first to have your Grand, I swear! No, no, Babe, I want my money now! Okay? I don't want it in ten years after you do your revolutionary music! - I want it now! - Well, I don't have it. Well you figure it out, I don't know how! You have to give it back to me! Sell your airplace cokpit, I don't know! You need to find it! This. - How much is this worth? - No! Hello. May I speak with Paul Jourdan please? Thank you. Paul, it's me. Yes. Everything is fine. I just have a favor to ask you. Can you lend me a Grand? No. Yes, I'm fine. I'll explain. It's for a job I didn't do. Thank you. You think you can bring it tonight? Okay. Yes. I'll let you work. See you later. There you go. You'll have it tonight. Okay. But don't feel like you need to stay afterwards. Hey I'll stay if I want. You're in Michel's flat and Michel is my pal. If I want to stick around, I do. Bye. - Yeah, whatever. - Yeah right. - Hi. - Ana? - Yeah? - Clara. We had an appointment today to record my voice. For the commercial. Oh, right! Fuck! I'm so sorry. I totally forgot to cancel you. Something came up... Okay. Can I at least invite you in for coffee? Yeah! Come in. Jean-Mi must have totally flipped out! What a prick! You're telling me! You know everytime he offers me a job I never know if it's for my voice or for my ass. No kidding. But haven't we met before? - I don't know... - Didn't you play with Daniel? Yes! We had a band together called Dharma Guns. That's it! I saw you play at a concert. Really? - That's crazy! - Yeah! And do you stil play together? No, no... You know, one day, Daniel wanted us to be the greatest band ever, the next he couldn't organize a rehearsal with the musicians. And he's spaced out. He smokes too much weed. Here I'm on my own. I have my stuff. My machines, my synthetizors. No one to give me shit. In any case, you're lucky. No, all this is not mine. It belongs to a friend of a friend who's lending me the studio. I brought my synthetizor and my sequencer but for the rest... - Oh I see... - No, I'd love it! Yeah. Well, it does look... ...incredible. If you still have time, we could record something. Yeah, okay! I would love to. - Downright! - Cool! I was missing something. For a long time, I've been looking for something more. Something that would really be my own. When this morning some guy brought me the beatbox right there. It's incredible and I think I'm on to something. You're the first person to hear it. It's just a beginning. It's crazy, those are not real drums, right? Yeah! I made it all right here, with everything there. - Only machines? - Yeah, only machines. It's crazy! - You like it? - Yeah! This would be the chorus... - That's it. - It's really good! I find it really inspiring. I took a few notes. Already? It's a first draft for the moment! It's not finished but if you don't mind playing it again so I can try something out? You want me to start it over from the beginning? Yeah! - I'll sing what I have in mind, okay? - Yeah. - That's the intro. - Yeah. It would start here. Yeah. Is it okay if it's English? Usually I write my stuff in French but for this one I hear English. Yes, of course! No problem for me, I'm open minded! In any case, let's try it! - Should I play the verse again? - Yes, if you don't mind. Okay. It's great. - Here it changes? - Yeah, there's a bridge. Here it takes off a bit, you can hear all the synthetizors? Yeah, I can hear in the back? Yeah, play it again... Something that would go like this... - Yeah, that sounds really good! - Yeah, I see. That was good. - Yeah? - Yeah. Can you play again? I have lyrics that could work. I mean might work. Yeah. - It's beautiful! - Cool! - Yeah! - Okay, cool! So after that... - Can we go straight to the chorus? - Yes. - Then we'll do the whole thing again? - Yeah, of course! Okay, so let's go there. Sorry, I'm just writing a few ideas as we go. Go ahead, there's another chorus coming anyway. I'm just throwing them in so we have a frame. Try the theme you sang on the verse but a little differently. - More open? - Yeah. Can you play it one last time? Okay. Just the chorus or the whole thing? No, just the chorus, I'm almost done. - Great! - Not bad, huh? - It's great! - I think we got it! It's really good. It's really good. We work really well together! But if you like we could start recording something. Yeah! I would love to! Let's try! Yeah? Okay. I'll get out the microphone. Okay, great! - Can you put on your headphones? - Yeah. Let me adjust your voice. Can you sing something? "It's the age of love, the age of friendship and adventure..." - Do you hear yourself okay? - Yes, I think so. Okay so let's do this. There we go... Do you mind if we start again with my voice louder? - I have trouble hearing it... - Yes, of course! Okay. Go! It's fucking awesome! - Really? - Yeah! I love it! Well done! Well done to you! It makes me think we could also add some delay on the voice. Maybe we could record you a second time to double your voice. Okay. For the moment I only have four tracks, so it's a little tricky but I'm sure I can ask a friend to lend me a sound gear. Wow, this is going to be... It's going to be fabulous! Okay. This is Chinese to my ears, but... I trust you. I know you work magic! - Should we get back to it? - Yeah! Go ahead! Look at them, how cute they are. The guys who invented this must have been under mushrooms. Thanks. What are they doing? Hey but you have a guitar? No, forget it, it's not mine. It hasn't moved an inch since I'm here. You know how to play? I sort of had a period... when I wanted to know more about acoustic instruments but it's really not my thing. But I can't play "Angie"! "Angie"! - Go ahead! - No, no, no! - Oh come on! - No! But go ahead, play something of you! I'm not sure of what it's going to sound like on this... Let me remember the chords... That's a good start! Like you, I have two hands Two hands at the end of my arms Ten fingers, like you And sometimes I'm scared Like you I'm scared That it might not be enough Like you, I have two legs Two legs that walk straight ahead... And I keep moving, like you I have a heart that's getting lost From waiting only for you You, who resembles me so much But doesn't understand me I have a heart that's getting lost From waiting only for you You, who resembles me so much But doesn't understand me I have a heart that's getting lost From waiting only for you You, who resembles me so much But doesn't understand me Wow! You've got a great voice! Oh no! Yes! It's crazy! Hey wait! We should do a band together! Hell yeah! But we need to find a name for it. I think I found a name... "Chapi Chapo"! "Chapi Chapo"! With such a name, if it doesn't take off... You're gonna have to go, I have an appointment. - We'll see each other tonight, right? - Yeah! Absolutely! Let's go... Thank you for everything! We had a great time! I'll see you to the door. Is it fine? The music doesn't bother you? On the contrary. It helps me relax. What is it? It's Laurie Spiegel. An American. She works with synthetizors like me. Like the ones in the living room. Oh. That's interesting. I never heard that. It sounds like it comes from the future. How do you make this type of music? It's not easy to explain. It's pretty instinctive really. It's mostly sensations. Images. A little like meditation really. Jolly good. You're lucky! Well you know, it's a long road! Sometimes I can spend hours on sequences... You're hurting me! Oh I'm sorry. - Is it okay like this? - Yes. There are only women who make this music? No, not at all. - There are very few in fact. - Oh... It's not too hard to make a living of it? First of all it takes about three months just to meet with a label. And then the few times I made it there I had comments like "You've got a pretty face, you should be a singer." I have to turn the record over. I have to go. We did more than an hour. Really? I didn't realize. Thank you. I feel much better! So... - See you next week? - See you next week. It's starting to look good, huh? Just a line of beige pencil under the eyes to open up your eyes. You're tickling me! Okay. What do you think? It's different. You never wear make-up? Not really. It suits you well! Thank you. Should we go? - Yeah, I'll be right there. - Okay. Did you like it? Really? No... Yeah... well you know, it doesn't matter. There's also the beatbox... Yes? Wow!... The Eiffel Tower! Here I am. I brought the garbage, I thought maybe you needed it. That's great! I'm Herve! Nice to meet you! I'm a friend of Ana. - Yeah? - Yeah! Woohooo! I can't really grasp. You just push buttons around. Yeah I get it. Sorry. Good evening! - Hi. - Wow! A pair of aces! Very funny. No, I am not a coat rack. But looks, it's right there! Good evening! You're okay, babe? Good evening! Good evening! Good evening... And you are? I am... Dominic Giroux. I don't know you. Nice to meet you. It seems you don't work in the music industry. Well no. Have a good evening. Stop it! Do you know about plate tectonics? Do you know about plate tectonics? No I don't know about plate tectonics. Are you kidding me? It's how the continents met! And it's exactly what's happening to us! - You and me? - Yeah. You and I, we'll climb up mountains! The Mont Blanc! We'll do the Mont blanc! Oooooh! Hey! The music! I don't see what the big fuss is about.. Oh come on. There's something. By the way, thank you for the money. Don't mention it! Can I serve you a drink? No, no, no. Come on! No, I have to be in court at nine tomorrow. Just a little one. No, no! Or just a drop. You know I have a colleague, Jean Marc, who's recording... Well he's not recording, but he takes care of Corine's rights. - You know her? - Of course I know her! And huh... She's recording an album in Blanc-Francard's studio... - You want to go? - Yeah! Okay! Listen, she's recording until about mid-July. And he told me if we want to stop by one night, there's no problem. I'm dying of thirst. So? Excuse me just a second, I'll be right back... Hi. Ana. Ana Klimova. Dominic Giroux, my pleasure. Ana! Thank you for the invitation. You're welcome. I'm sorry, I'm looking around for something to drink. Wait, let me serve you. Hi. Olivia! Hey. - Dominic? - Yes? - Here. - I just wanted to ask you... about the music we heard earlier. You know, the music that was a little different? Yes. Different indeed. You mean the tape you played? Yes! What did you think of it? Why? Did you compose it? Yes. Honestly miss... There's something there. I was intrigued by the way your synthetizors sound. Your beatbox has also a good sound. But I'm afraid there's no market for such music in France. And your singer has a nice voice. Why always want to sing in English? We're in Paris, right? - Indeed. - Indeed. Don't get discouraged. You're beautiful. You're young. Thank you. Keep on working. - Will you come to dance now? - Yes I'm coming! Are you okay? Yeah. You wanna go to the studio? No, I'm just... We need some fresh air. We need to get out of here. You come with me? For a walk or something. Yeah. Come. Who did I think I was? I've been in this studio for six months. Six months and I wasn't even able to write the music for a stupid commercial. You don't want to write music for commercials! It's not suprising you can't do music for commercials! I don't understand. Excuse me... What's wrong? - What's wrong? - Yeah? Do you realize what I'm going through right now? Are you kidding me? You're... devoting your life to this. You put all your energy into it. It's your life, and all of a sudden... All of a sudden, some guy comes up who tells you "Yeah, it's not much, I don't know, I don't get it" when it's obvious that guy is not made to like or understand your music! And I don't know who he is, and I don't care! Exactly! You don't know who he is! You don't know who he is. You don't know what it's like to work alone in my fucking studio for months and finally play some music for someone who doesn't give a shit about me! - Do you understand what it feels like? - Yes, okay. Next to the guy who doesn't give a shit about you there are people around you who... - Who? But who? - Your friends! The people you work with! All these people, suddenly they're relegated to what? Nothing? These are the people that you deal with! These are the people you should be listening to! Not some random guy! You don't fucking get it! These people are not going to record my album! These people are not gonna have me play for an audience! They won't sell my records, they won't make people listen to my music! It's none of this people! What would I give a shit about... Do you want to sell records now? Do you want to sell records? Yeah. I want people to listen to the music I make. It's pretty logical. But people will listen. You just need to keep doing what you're doing. So why all of a sudden, you don't believe in your music anymore? All this time you spend trying out new ideas, composing what's the point to all that wasted time if Sorry, that didn't come out right. What I wanted to say was that there are people who love what you do. They tell you that they love what you but you don't listen to them. Why do you listen specifically to the one who thinks he holds the truth and goes around bragging? He's not the only one... Who is this guy anyway? He's a really important guy. You know very well, I told you about him many times! You know what I think? I think that... what you're going through... now... There's not one single artist who hasn't been through the exact same thing. I think that... One day, a guy told me: " What matters in life is not how many times you fall, it's how many times you get back up." And downfalls like that, you'll have many more! What an asshole! Did you look at him? Excuse me but it's obvious! That guy can't understand your music! For sure! He looks worse than me. You're missing the gold chain. Yeah. Come on. Giroux! Fuck you! Androgynous figure Your hips outlining The divine curve Of your slighty uncovered underwear And alone in the dark You're walking late at night That's an Oberheim! It's really rare! Shadows drifting in the dark Dance, dance, dance Lilo's dreaming of a new love story Dance, dance, dance A cute lingerie In a feminine style Hearts are pounding And eyes are lighting up Shadows drifting in the dark Dance, dance, dance Lilo's dreaming of a new love story Dance, dance, dance Okay, okay! Let's have a break. It was not bad. It was great, darling. - Hi Corine. - Hi. I'm Paul, a friend of... of Jean Marc, who probably told you we would come by. Yes, yes. Jean Marc. This is Ana. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. This song is great. It's for your next single? Yeah well I'm not sure. We'll finish the album and see! - You want a cigarette? - Yeah, thank you. So you're the musician, right? Yeah. I play on synthetizors and I also compose. - Do you need a light? - Yes please. Thank you very much. You do space music, that's it? No, not at all. I do something closer to disco, a little like what you do. Only I don't have musicians, I do everything with my machines. Ah! You're the smart one! If you're interested, I could make you listen! Oh yes! I would love that! Especially as I wonder how disco without musicians might sound like. But like do you have a label? Or somebody helping you out? No. For now I'm on my own. But I just recorded a song with an incredible singer and I had Giroux listen to it, who actually didn't think much of it. Oh but you know, Giroux... Don't let that stop you! You have to persist! Believe in yourself! You know, for me, it didn't happen all at first! Hey, leave me your number! I'll come by! Okay. Great! Do you have a pen? A light... A pen... wait. Thank you! You're welcome! Here... Great. I have to get back. If we can hang out... Of course! You'll call me? Sure! Come on boys, let's do it again! Thank you! That's good... Androgynous figure Your hips outlining The divine curve Of your slightly uncovered underwear And alone in the dark You're walking late at night The blue lights of the bar Light up the sidewalk I have to go back.
