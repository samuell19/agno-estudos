"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" Based on the novella by R. L. Stevenson Mother, I already drew his body. Do I need to draw his soul now? Mother, where is a person's soul? Screenplay: Georgi Kapralov, Aleksandr Orlov Director: Aleksandr Orlov There, there, straight ahead! The cab's out front, sir. Sir, the cab's out front. Sir! It's alright. Simply a hungry faint. Move along, move along. Diana? Bad news, I'm afraid, Henry. You're late again, dinner's over. You'll have to eat alone, which is deleterious to a man of your habits. If a man is worth inviting, he is worth waiting for. How fares your new patient? They say she's lovely, even in a faint. How have you heard about that, Diana? Why, it's simple. We've had a telephone installed. Lady Joan informed me that she saw you save that poor girl. Oh, that Lady Joan. We were also hungry without you here, Henry. You should have a telephone installed. I'll telephone you every 30 minutes. My joy... Remember, we haven't met yet, Henry. Thank you. Go ahead, go ahead... Good evening, Henry. Good evening. Here, we can speak privately and you can tell me that story. Happy to see you, Utterson, old man. - Good evening, Jekyll. - Good evening. I need to speak to you about your will. My poor Utterson. I never saw a man so distressed as you were... when you read my will. Sorry, old man, I won't be a moment. I apologize, I was delayed. Ah, there you are, Doctor. - Good evening. - We're used to it by now, you're always busy, always treating someone. Jekyll, I'm happy to see you. Actually, would you mind taking a look at our young Dick? He seems to have a suspicious cough. Don't be silly, Neville. He's felt better for a while now. Has he? Excuse me, Doctor. I rather think he has a cough, dear. Next time, Doctor, I'd like to take advantage of your kind disposition towards us. I'm always at your service, sir. You know, Henry, I never approved of your will. Oh, my will. Yes, certainly, I know that. - You have told me so. - Well, I tell you so again. You're my friend, and a longtime client, and were you in my place, you also wouldn't fail to remark on a document which provided that all your possessions were to pass into the hands of your friend and benefactor, a Mr. Edward Hyde, not only in the case of your decease, but also in the case of your disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months, at which point the said Hyde should enter into possession of your property, totaling roughly a million pounds, free from any burden or obligation. This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop. Henry, you know me. You know I am a man to be trusted. I begin to fear that there is some secret at the bottom of this. Tell me in confidence. I make no doubt I can get you out of it. My good Utterson. This is very good of you, but indeed it isn't what you fancy. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking. But to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: The moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde, easily and permanently. I give you my hand upon that. But who is this Mr. Hyde? Where did he come from? Introduce us. That wouldn't be easy to do, Utterson, not at all easy. He rarely visits me. But... how old is he, what is his occupation, what sort of a man is he to see, at the very least? Are these things I may ask? He is not easy to describe. His appearance is unusual. There is something displeasing about it, downright detestable. He is a man of small stature, he has light hair, roughly 28 years old, perhaps 30... No, Utterson, I can't describe his appearance, and it's not want of memory, for I declare I can see him this moment. I'd like to understand the reason for your affection towards Hyde, or perhaps even bondage to him, call it which you please. This is a private matter. Come. Please join me. - Eh? - Mr. Hyde? If I'm not mistaken? Yes. That is my name. What do you want? I am an old friend of Dr. Jekyll's, Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street. Might you admit me with you? You will not find Dr. Jekyll inside, he is from home. How did you know me? Before I answer, will you do me a favor? With pleasure. What shall it be? Will you let me see your face? Thank you. Now I shall know you again. It may be useful. Apropos, you should have my address. Soho, 18 Gower Street. Soho, 18 Gower Street! Soho, 18 Gower Street. Thank you. Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole? I will see, sir. Come in. Will you wait here by the fire? Or would you care to sit down? Yes, here, thank you. My mind misgives me Henry is in deep waters. If this Hyde suspects the existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Mr. Utterson! Mr. Utterson! Dr. Jekyll has gone out. Poole, I saw... Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room. Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home? Quite right, sir. Mr. Hyde has a key. Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man. He does indeed. We have all orders to obey him. I do not think, Poole... I ever met Mr. Hyde here? Dear no, sir. He never dines here. Indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house. He always comes and goes by the laboratory. Well, good night, Poole. And tell your master I'd like to see him, tomorrow, for instance. And one other thing. Give him this cane. No particular reason. Call it a small gift. - Good night, Mr. Utterson. - Good night, Poole. It's not far, sir. It seems the victim was a man high in public estimation. A purse and gold watch were found in his pocket, but no cards or papers, except a sealed envelope, addressed to you, Mr. Utterson. Which was the reason we asked you to come. Drive! Yes, I understand. Will you help us identify the body, Mr. Utterson? Yes, of course. I must examine it. I pray to god my suspicions aren't founded. The murderer was gone, but left a great deal of evidence. Most importantly, a woman recognized him, one of these ladies of ill repute. Left here. She had just been walking outside of her establishment. The murderer is a certain Mr. Hyde. It happened here. Here. There, there... Yes, I recognize him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew. - A Member of Parliament. - There, there... There, there... Good god. Can it be, sir? Scandal. Here, here... And this... is the murder weapon, sir. The murderer struck him with such ferocious cruelty that the stick, although made from some very tough and heavy wood, broke. And this half rolled over there, to the pavement. Perhaps you know the murderer? Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature? Yes. Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, as the witness states. He frequented this establishment. Soho, 18 Gower Street. Soho, 18 Gower Street! If you will come with me in my cab, I think I can take you to his house. Forgot your keys again, and at such a late hour. I was told this is Mr. Hyde's residence? Yes, this is Mr. Hyde's. He's not at home. He came in very late tonight, and left again in less than an hour. There's nothing strange in that. Very well. In that case, we wish to see his rooms. I had better tell you who we are. This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard. And I'm Utterson, notary and attorney. He's in trouble, is he? What has he done? He don't seem a very popular character. And now, my good woman, let me and this gentleman have a look about us. Come in, come in. Yes... Oh, it's you, Utterson. Good morning. You may go, Poole. Yes, yes. I hope you've heard what took place last night. Carew was my longtime client. You have not been mad enough - to hide this scoundrel, have you? - Utterson. Utterson, I swear to God, I will never set eyes on him again. I bind my honor to you that I am done with him in this world. And indeed he does not need my help. You do not know him... as I do. He's found a safe place for himself, quite safe. Mark my words, he will never more be seen or heard of. You seem pretty sure of him. But you must remember. If it came to a trial, your name will appear. There is one thing on which you may advise me, Utterson. I have received a letter, and I am at a loss whether I should show it... to the police. I should like to leave it in your hands. I have so great a trust in you, Utterson. "Mr. Jekyll, I am writing to you, "whom I have so unworthily repaid "for a thousand generosities. "You need labor under no alarm for my safety. - There. - "I have means of escape "on which I place a sure dependence. Edward Hyde." Have you the envelope? I burned it. But it's all the same. It bore no postmark. The note was handed in. - I shall keep it and sleep upon it. - Right. And now one word more. It was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will... about that disappearance? I knew it. He meant to murder you. You had a fine escape, Henry. Utterson, I have had what is far more to the purpose. I have had a lesson. Utterson... My God, what a lesson I have had! By the by, there was a letter handed in today. What was the messenger like? Today, sir? Nothing had come except by post. And only circulars by that. No. This was not written by a madman. But... it is an odd hand. And by all accounts, the hand of a very odd writer. Sir, I recently saw Mr. Jekyll's file on your desk. May I take a look... at his file? You simply wish to see it? - Are you trying to recall anything? - No, no. I simply wish to see it. Simply to see it. Thank you, sir. It's a very interesting autograph. Why did you compare them, Guest? Well, sir... I've rarely seen such a... singular resemblance, the two hands are in many points identical. Rather quaint. - Come in. - Thank you. I'm happy to see you, Lanyon. How are you feeling, my friend? I am a doomed man. I tell you as a physician. I have had a shock, and I shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant. I liked it. Yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should... be more glad to get away. Do not give up hope, my friend. Jekyll is ill, too... Have you seen him recently? I wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll. I am quite done with that person, and beg that you'll spare me any allusion to one... whom I regard as dead. Tut-tut... can't I do anything? We are three very old friends, Lanyon, we shall not live to make others. Nothing can be done for me. Ask himself. - He will not see me. - I am not surprised at that. Some day, after I am dead, Utterson... Yes, after I am dead... you may come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you now. I called for you to notarize... this. "Personal, to be placed in the hands of John Gabriel Utterson. "Not to be opened until the death or disappearance of Henry Jekyll"? I have told you all I can. I cannot explain further. By the way, did I ever tell you that I once saw him here?* And sensed that trouble was inevitable? The police can find no trace of Hyde in London. I assume we shall never see more of Mr. Hyde. To tell you the truth, I am concerned with something different altogether. Sir? What! Jekyll! I trust you are better. No, I am very low, very low, Utterson. But it will not last long, thank God. You stay too much indoors. You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Guest and me. My head clerk, Mr. Guest, Dr. Jekyll. Come now, get your hat and take a quick turn with us. You are very good. I should like to very much. But no. No, no, Utterson, it is quite impossible. I am very glad to see you, I would ask you and Mr. Guest up... but the place is really not fit. Why then, we can stay down here and speak with you from where we are. That is just what I was about to venture to propose... - God forgive us. - God forgive us. Hello? Hello? Henry? It is you. Heavens, I didn't recognize you. I hadn't heard from you in ages. What? I'm glad to hear you, of course, but I would also be glad to see you. You have a much better effect on me than any tonic that you prescribe me. What's the matter with your voice? Are you not well? I was worried about you, for some reason. Couldn't you have telephoned me? Worry does not become us, Henry. What is the matter with your voice? No, perhaps the telephone is distorting it? Hello? Hello? Bless me, what brings you here, Poole? - Mr. Utterson. - What's the matter? There is... something wrong. Compose yourself. Here is a glass of wine. Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want. Mr. Utterson, I'm afraid. Now, my good man, be explicit. What are you afraid of? I've been afraid for about a week, and I can bear it no more. I can bear it no more! Come, I see you have some good reason. I see there is something seriously amiss. Try, try to tell me what it is. I think there's been... - foul play, sir. - Foul play? - Is that you, Poole? - Yes, open the door. Come in, sir. Why are you all here? Very irregular. Bless God! It's Mr. Utterson! Hold your tongue! Reach me a candle. We'll get this through hands at once. Sir, follow me. Come as gently as you can. Quietly. I don't want you to be heard... but I want you to hear. And see here. If by any chance he was to ask you in, don't go. Sir, Mr. Utterson is asking to see you. - Tell him I cannot see anyone. - Thank you, sir. Mr. Utterson! Mr. Utterson! Was that my master's voice? It seems much changed. Changed? Have I been 40 years in this man's house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir, master's made away with. And who or what Is in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!* This is a very strange tale, Poole. Suppose it were as you suppose, and Dr. Jekyll was murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? It doesn't commend itself to reason. You are a hard man to satisfy, Mr. Utterson, but I'll do it, I'll do it yet. All this last week, it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was the master's way to write his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stair. Well, sir, this week we've seen nothing back besides. Nothing but papers, and a closed door. The very meals left there on the stair to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Every day, and twice and thrice in the same day, I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back... there would be another paper telling me to return it. And another order to a different firm. This is absurd. Why does he need this medicine? What matters the medicine? I've seen him! It was this way. And you... recognized him, Poole? Sir, that vermin scurried off so quickly that I could hardly swear to that. But if you mean, was it Mr. Hyde... Why, yes, I think it was. Who else could have got in by the laboratory door? He has his key! In that case, Poole, I shall consider it my duty - to break in that door. - That's talking, Mr. Utterson. And now comes the question, who is going to do it? You and me. Whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser. Sir. There is an axe here. And you might take the kitchen poker for yourself. Follow me, sir. Do you know, Poole, that you and I are about to place ourselves... in a position of some peril? You may say so, sir. I'm book-learned enough for that. Jekyll, I demand to see you! Do you hear me? I give you fair warning. Our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you. Utterson, for God's sake, have mercy! Down with the door, Poole! That's not Henry's voice! Sir! That is the same drug that I was always bringing him. We have come too late, whether to save or punish. Hyde... is gone to his account. The glass, he acquired it recently. That glass has seen some strange things, sir. And surely none stranger than itself. - I don't know what Jekyll could want... - Look! My dear Utterson, when this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure. You will learn all in the confession of your unworthy and unhappy friend, Henry Jekyll. - No one must know of these papers. - Yes, sir. If your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. Yes, but... where is my master? Calm down. Compose yourself. It is now 22:00. Around midnight, send someone to Scotland Yard. Have them summon Inspector Newcomen. Will you remember? Newcomen. - God grant my fears are baseless! - Yes, sir. My dear Utterson, It is with difficulty that I write this. I am tearful, despair suffocates me. I've taken a great deal of liberty, but it seems there are limits to our capabilities. I carried out a dreadful experiment. I knew I risked my life, but I drew steadily nearer to that truth which concerned me. As you know, I was born to a large fortune, endowed with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, seemingly with every guarantee of a distinguished future. In my youth I was taught love, kindness, and service of my fellow man. But the war we led in Africa exposed... the unknown elements in my soul. The effectiveness of the new uniform's camouflage exceeded our expectations. Even the local women no longer notice us. Here. Colonel! We'll be finished shortly, sir. But, Colonel... it seems that some of them are merely badly wounded. No emotion. After all, you wouldn't... wring your hands at the sight of a dying hyena. But I'm a physician. We're at war. Understood, lieutenant? Yes, sir. We're at war. I didn't expect to learn that good and evil reside in my soul side by side, like twins. I was wracked by pangs of conscience. But I continued to fall in line. She's not half bad. What do you say, Doctor? Not half bad, eh? I swore to myself that the instant I took off the uniform, I would never betray my virtue again. Oh, it's you, Doctor. Diana, this is Henry Jekyll, - our regimental surgeon. - Colonel, hello. - Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - Likewise. - My wife, Diana. - How do you do. After meeting Diana, I felt my life return to the course followed by most of those I associated with. I enjoyed myself, came to some distinction, accrued wealth. For the first time, I began to reflect on how I might separate good and evil, those twins forever at war within me. The unjust twin might go his way, delivered from aspirations and remorse. And the just could walk on his upward path. Thus began my sacrilegious experiment. I led a double existence. It grew into a thing of course. Meanwhile, my experiments brought me nearer to my goal every day. I will not enter too deeply into the details of my discovery. It is not fully clear even to me. It took a great deal of time to prepare the necessary tincture. I purchased, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt, which turned out to be the last ingredient I required. Thus I was able to prepare the tincture for the first time. I couldn't help but test it. That night, I was intoxicated with my incredible discovery. Once, Utterson, you witnessed my experiment when you chanced upon... and I wonder now if it was truly chance... upon Edward Hyde. That meeting brings me joy still. For in the form of Hyde there existed a part of my liberated self. This was how I lost control of myself. Hyde became more and more active and hard to control, but I liked his youth, his strength, his abandon, his freedom from all prohibitions. I failed to resist the temptation of such a life, and before I noticed, I became a slave to my evil half. I will not enter into the details of the infamy at which I connived. Hyde, and Hyde alone, was guilty, I told myself. But the devil sank his claws ever deeper into me, and subjugated me to his will. Evil begat evil. She came to me herself... Yes, I remember... Come, come. Careful, you reprobate. Yes... Wait, wait... Wait. Quiet... You're taking quite a bit of liberty, young man. If you have any credit in London, I shall undertake that you should lose it. Mother, where is a person's soul? Rotten swine! What? Alive... God... I'm through. I'm through. Through. Through! Hyde was thenceforth impossible. I believed was done with him for good. For two months I was beset by nightmares. And finally I felt I had rid myself of this devilish possession. Is something the matter, sir? I believed I returned to genuine life. So, gentlemen, let's get started. Oh, how lovely. The sooner we start, the sooner we'll finish. My dear. Please, gentlemen. General, tell me, was it hard? Yes, it was hot there. And we changed our undergarments infrequently. Yes, war is war, gentlemen. - Excuse me. - We triumphed, and that's wonderful. - The use of new forms of arms... - Such as the Maxima machine gun, and, of course, the scorched earth tactic, worked admirably. - They contributed to our success. - Yes. Beg your pardon, what losses did you incur? Roughly 1,500 men. - Is that so? - Yes, of course. It was a vicious war, and victory cannot be won without blood. But Transvaal was worth it, gentlemen. There you are, Henry. What's wrong? - It's stuffy in here. - The Chewa... Let's step out into the garden. As well as other tribes were harshly exploited by the Afrikaners. So they didn't actively take part in combat against... You're not feeling yourself again? No, I am. We seized the belongings of the prisoners of war, a lot of... I can tolerate your ill disposition. But I can't excuse it. As I once told you, Diana, occasionally I am in need of a physician myself. You're feeling better. Yes. Henry! What are you doing? Henry! Some water? Calm yourself, Diana, calm yourself. A registered letter, sir. Why on earth would Jekyll... contact me this way? He never wrote me before. Dear Lanyon, you are one of my oldest friends. My life, my honor, my reason, are all at your mercy. You must follow my instructions below to the letter. Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks at the bare thought of such a possibility. - Dr. Lanyon? - Yes. I've received written orders from my master. - The locksmith's already here. Come in. - Yes, quickly. Is everything done? Yes, sir. Dr. Jekyll said you are to go in alone. That he's explained everything. At midnight, dismiss your servants, and make sure to be alone. You must admit with your own hand a man who will present himself in my name. And place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought from my cabinet. Are you come from Dr. Jekyll? Have you got it? Have you got it? Come, sir. I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. I beg your pardon. What you say is very well founded. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry Jekyll. I understood you have the drawer... Compose yourself, sir. Here it is. - A syringe. - A syringe? Do you have a syringe? Calm down, sir. Now, perhaps... you will be wise? And suffer me... to go forth from your house? Or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you? Think before you answer. For it shall be done as you decide. I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end. Lanyon, you remember your vows? What follows... is under the seal of our profession, eh? It is... It is you? Henry? You see what you see. You came as... Hyde... It is the horror of my life. This devil I have awoken within me. But cannot always control. No, it is... it is impossible, Henry! It cannot be! What's happened to you, sir? Now now, Poole. As you can see, I am alive and well. Yes... My dear Utterson, when this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure. I paid the dearest price of all. If you can, forgive me. Your loving friend, Henry Jekyll. Poor Jekyll. Farewell. Sir, Poole sent me to tell you that the inspector has arrived.
