# ROMEO WAS RESTLESS, HE WAS READY TO KILL # HE JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW 'CAUSE HE COULDN'T SIT STILL # JULIET WAS WAITING WITH A SAFETY NET # HE SAID, DON'T BURY ME, 'CAUSE I'M NOT DEAD YET # WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # I WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME # 'CAUSE I'VE TRIED AND I'VE TRIED # AND I'M STILL MYSTIFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # WELL, I REMEMBER WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT # AND I WAS TRYIN' TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE # IT WAS NEVER IN DOUBT # SHE THOUGHT THAT I KNEW, AND I THOUGHT THAT SHE KNEW # SO BOTH OF US WERE WILLING # BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT # WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # I WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME # 'CAUSE I'VE TRIED AND I'VE TRIED # AND I'M STILL MYSTIFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I WAS DOWN UNDER THE COVERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT # TRYIN' TO DISCOVER MY LEFT FOOT FROM MY RIGHT # YOU CAN SEE THOSE PICTURES IN ANY MAGAZINE # BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF LOOKIN' # WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN? # WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # I WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE MYSTERY DANCE # WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME # 'CAUSE I'VE TRIED AND I'VE TRIED # AND I'M STILL MYSTIFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED # I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, AND I'M NOT SATISFIED IT'S AN UNCOMPROMISING STANDARD OF HIS PRACTICE. HE NEVER MEETS ANY OF HIS CLIENTS. HE DOESN'T SPEAK WITH THEM, OR, FOR THAT MATTER, COMMUNICATE IN ANY DIRECT FASHION. IT'S HIS POLICY. BUT I AM HIS SOLE REPRESENTATIVE, AND HE IS MY ONLY EMPLOYER, AND, AS SUCH, I HAVE FULL AUTHORIZATION TO SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF ON ALL HIS MATTERS OF BUSINESS. I HAVE WITH ME A SIGNED LETTER TO THAT EFFECT. HE DOESN'T NEGOTIATE HIS FEE. HE WORKS AT A FLAT RATE. UNDER SOME UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, HE'LL WORK PRO BONO. NEVER IN BETWEEN. I SUPPOSE I DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE LATTER CATEGORY. I HAVEN'T HEARD YOUR PROPOSAL YET. WELL, I HAVE A FEELING THAT MINE IS NOT A CHARITY CASE. MOST AREN'T. MISTER ARLO, YOU REALIZE THIS IS ALL VERY STRANGE. I MEAN, NOBODY IN YOUR FIELD... ASKS THE KIND OF MONEY YOUR EMPLOYER DOES, AND NOBODY COMMUNICATES VIA A, UH... A MESSENGER. IT'S ALL VERY UNUSUAL. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE CASE OF THE MAN WITH THE MISMATCHED SHOELACES. THIS WAS MANY YEARS AGO, WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO HIS EMPLOY. HE WAS CONTRACTED TO FIND A MAN... I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GIVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF DETAIL... BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THAT IF THIS MAN HAD NOT BEEN LOCATED, OUR COUNTRY'S GOOD DIPLOMACY WITH A CERTAIN ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER MIGHT HAVE A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FACE TODAY. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AUTHORITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD WERE SEARCHING AROUND THE CLOCK FOR A FACE WHOSE SIGNIFICANCE IT COULDN'T FATHOM. HE'D VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE. ON THE EIGHTH MORNING OF THE SEARCH, I WAS CONTACTED BY A NONPOLITICAL THIRD PARTY WITH AN UNRELATED PRIVATE AGENDA. PRIOR TO THIS DAY, MY EMPLOYER HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS MISSING MAN, KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIM. AFTER JUST ONE HOUR OF DESK WORK, JUST AN HOUR AFTER ACCEPTING THE CASE, HE PICKED UP THE TELEPHONE AND PLACED A CALL. GUESS WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE? THE MISSING MAN? THE MAN WITH THE MISMATCHED SHOELACES. WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THE HOUSE. I'M TELLING YOU, HE NEVER EVEN LEAVES THE HOUSE, OK? I MEAN, HE'S LIKE SOME KIND OF RECLUSE, COMPLETE FREAK. NO SOCIAL LIFE. IN FACT, NO SOCIAL SKILLS. IT'S A STRANGE FUCKING THING. WHEN HE'S WORKING, SMOOTHEST OPERATOR YOU'VE EVER SEEN... BRAVE, SLICK, CUNNING. CAN DO ANYTHING. AS SOON AS HE GETS OFF WORK, IT'S ALL GONE. AFRAID TO GO TO THE DRY CLEANERS. LITERALLY. TOO UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS OWN SKIN TO GO OUT AND EAT. TACTLESS. AND INEPT. RUDE, TOO. JUST AN ASSHOLE. YOU COULD MEET HIM 5 TIMES WITHOUT EVER REALIZING IT'S THE SAME PERSON. HE CAN TELL YOU WHERE YOU WERE BORN, HOW OLD YOUR MOTHER WAS AT THE TIME, AND WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST... ALL WITHIN 30 SECONDS OF MEETING YOU. HE CAN ELICIT A CONFESSION FROM A CRIMINAL WITHOUT THEIR REALIZING THEY'RE BEING QUESTIONED. HOW DOES HE DO IT? HE HAS A DEEPLY NUANCED AND THOROUGHLY FUNCTIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR TO RIVAL THE GREAT PSYCHOANALYTICAL MINDS OF OUR TIME. HE UNDERSTANDS THE CRIMINAL MIND AS WELL AS THE INNOCENT MIND, THE STABLE MIND AS WELL AS PSYCHOTIC, SOCIOPATHIC MIND, THE MALE AS WELL AS THE FEMALE. I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER KISSED A GIRL. HE'S, LIKE, 30-SOMETHING YEARS OLD. WHAT DOES HE DO WHEN HE'S NOT WORKING? WHAT, DOES HE JUST SIT AROUND THE HOUSE? WHEN PRIVATE INVESTIGATION WON ITS MOST WORTHY CHAMPION, ACADEMIA AND THE ARTS SUFFERED A LOSS, A GREAT LOSS. IN ADDITION TO HIS MANY SCHOLARLY GIFTS, HE'S ALSO A TERRIFICALLY TALENTED MUSICIAN. HE WRITES SONGS. HE'S TERRIBLE. HIS METAPHORS ARE THIN, HIS IMAGERY IS CLICHÃ¡D, AND HIS THEMATIC MATERIAL IS TRITE AND HEAVY-HANDED. WHY DO YOU DO IT? I LEFT THE FIRM, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GONNA DO... AND I GET THIS MESSAGE ON MY MACHINE. HE WATCHED ME ARGUE A CASE IN COURT. SAID I WAS THE ONLY PERSON FOR THE JOB. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, THE GUY'S NUTS, OK? WHAT'S HIS NAME? THE MYSTERIOUS AND BRILLIANT DARYL ZERO. HE CERTAINLY DOES TAKE HIMSELF SERIOUSLY, DOESN'T HE? ALL RIGHT, MR. ARLO. I'M SOLD. WHAT HAPPENS NOW? YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS THAT MY EMPLOYER CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU. THEN I FLY BACK HOME AND SPEAK TO HIM. WHERE IS HOME? NOT TO BE COY, MR. STARK, BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT. OF COURSE NOT. YOU KNOW, MR. ARLO, I'M NOT USED TO BEING IN THIS POSITION... BEING NEEDY. I UNDERSTAND. YES. YOU KNOW, IT'S OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU NOT LEAVE YOUR CONFIDENCE OR THAT OF YOUR, UH... INACCESSIBLE EMPLOYER. THAT I CAN GUARANTEE. MR. ARLO, I HAVE LOST MY KEYS, AND I NEED TO FIND THEM. I'M BEING BLACKMAILED, MR. ARLO. SO FAR, IT'S COST ME A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY AND MANY NIGHTS SLEEP. I NEED THE MATTER RESOLVED. I NEED SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED, AND I NEED TO KNOW WHO IT IS WHO HAS STOLEN THE KEY TO MY SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. MR. ARLO, GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR. THANKS, RAY. KEEP IT CLOSE, WILL YOU? I'LL ONLY BE ABOUT 20 MINUTES OR SO. YOU GOT IT. WE'LL KEEP IT UP TOP. GREAT. HI, JOE. # HERE I COME A-KNOCKIN' # A-KNOCKIN' AT YOUR DOOR # ON THIS OCTOBER DAY # LET'S RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED # THAT'S THE ONLY THING FOR US TO DO # LET'S RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED # IF YOU LOVE ME LIKE I LOVE YOU # AND IF I COME A-CALLIN' # EVERY AFTERNOON # WOULD YOU BE GLAD I COME A-CALLIN' # AND WHISTLE A MERRY TUNE? # AND IF I POP THE QUESTION # STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART # WOULD YOU SAY # MITCH, LET'S RUN AWAY AND BE HAPPY? # 'CAUSE IF YOU WOULD # I'D SAY, OH # LET'S RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED # IT'S THE ONLY THING FOR US TO DO # LET'S RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED # IF YOU LOVE ME # LIKE I # I # LOVE # YOU-OU-OU THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. YOU LIKE IT? MM-HMM. I HAD THE FIRST VERSE A WHILE AGO. BUT I JUST GOT THAT SECOND ONE... JUST A COUPLE HOURS AGO. YOU REALLY LIKE IT? YEAH. WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN? I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU. I CAME STRAIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT. I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR 3 DAYS. 3. I JUST LOVE THOSE AMPHETAMINES. GOT TO LOVE THEM. GOT TO LOVE THEM. SOUNDS HEALTHY. IT'S GOOD FOR MY SKIN. DID YOU KNOW, IF YOU DO ENOUGH OF THAT STUFF OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, YOU GET, LIKE, THESE CANKER SORES ON YOUR TONGUE AND THEY BLEED? SEE? THAT'S DISGUSTING. WHAT'D THE GUY IN PORTLAND WANT? BLACKMAIL. HMM. WHAT'S HIS NAME? STARK. GREGORY STARK... OREGON TIMBER. YEAH. HE'S A VERY RICH MAN. OLD MONEY. BLACKMAIL, HUH? WHAT, DID HE KILL SOMEBODY OR FUCK SOMEBODY? FUCKED SOMEBODY OVER, SOUNDS LIKE. EMBEZZLEMENT MAYBE. RUNS IN THE FAMILY, I GUESS. HIS OLD MAN, JORDAN, HAD A BIG TAX-EVASION SUIT AGAINST HIM IN '82. HE WAS LEGALLY EXONERATED, BUT KARMACALLY CONVICTED, APPARENTLY, 'CAUSE HE DIED RIGHT AFTER THE ACQUITTAL. IT WAS A MASSIVE CORONARY. HE ATE LIKE A PIG. HE WAS JUST A FAT MAN. AND GREGORY STARK IS THE SON OF A FAT MAN. YEAH. YOU WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST HOUND DOWN THIS TRAIL. WHO? CLEARBURG. DAMN. DIDN'T TURN A THING. THAT FUCKIN' HACK. YOU KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE WITH THAT FUCKIN' CLEARBURG IS? HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKIN' TACT. HE STINKS UP THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND HE'S PISSED ON ME, TOO. HE'S JUST REPULSIVE. OK. GREGORY STARK. HOW DESPERATE? SCALE OF ONE TO 10. BORDERING ON MANIC. DO I NEED TO GO THERE? MM, I THINK YOU'D WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. THERE ISN'T TOO MUCH TO GO ON HERE. I'D HAVE TO GO THERE? YEAH. I DON'T LIKE IT. OH, FUCK THAT SHITHEAD. TELL HIM I'LL DO IT. WAIT. DON'T YOU EVEN WANT TO HEAR WHAT IT IS? WHAT IS IT TODAY, HUH? WHAT DAY IS IT? SUNDAY. I'LL GET ON THE PLANE TO PORTLAND... AT 11:15 TONIGHT. ARRIVING PORTLAND AT 1:32 A.M. YOU'LL GIVE ME THE DETAILS ON THE WAY TO THE AIRPORT TONIGHT. BE HERE AT 10:00. WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. TONIGHT? CAN'T IT WAIT TILL TOMORROW? SO I CAN HAVE AT LEAST ONE NIGHT WITH JESS? NO. YOU'RE GONNA GO TOMORROW AT 7:36 A.M., BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO DRIVE ME TO THE AIRPORT TONIGHT AT 10:00. DO YOU WANT THAT LOW-CAL BREAKFAST? NO. MY ABILITIES ARE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED AND MAYBE EVEN DISABLED RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. UH... I GUESS I GOTTA GET TO SLEEP RIGHT NOW. DARYL. I'LL SEE YOU AT 10:00. DARYL? DARYL? JESS? # TAKE MY HAND AND LET IT BEGIN # OPEN YOUR HEART AND LET ME IN # GIRL, I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU # AND I THINK YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME, TOO # WHO'S THIS GIRL WHOSE KISS IS ALL I DREAM OF... OH. YOU'RE ALL WET. I DON'T CARE. THANK YOU FOR THE FLOWERS. YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU WANNA COME IN? MM-HMM. I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK. GLAD TO BE BACK. SO, WHERE ARE YOU GONNA TAKE ME TONIGHT? JESUS. HE WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT'S IN THE BOX. FROM WHAT I COULD PIECE TOGETHER, IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME SORT OF FINANCIAL RECORD, BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME. SO, WHATEVER IT IS HE'S HIDING, HE KEEPS IT IN A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX, BUT THEN HE KEEPS THE KEY TO THE BOX CLEVERLY HIDDEN ON HIS KEY RING WITH HIS CAR KEYS AND HIS HOUSE KEYS? I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT HE SAID. SO, ANYWAY, ABOUT A YEAR AGO... IT'LL BE A YEAR ON THE 12th... HE LOSES HIS KEYS. THEY HAD A GOLD-PLATED SWISS ARMY KNIFE ATTACHED TO THEM. A COUPLE OF DAYS PASS, HE GETS A LITTLE PANICKY. FLIGHT 2064 TO PORTLAND. HAROLD BURGESS. THEN ON JUNE 23rd, HE GETS A LETTER AT THE OFFICE. IT COMES FED EX, STAMPED PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL. SENDER'S NAME MARKED AS "PAST DUE COLLECTIONS." OOH, THAT'S NICE. LASER-PRINTED, NOT VERY LONG. STARTS OUT, "MR. STARK, "I HAVE EVIDENCE LINKING YOU TO YOUR CRIME. "YOU MAY ENTERTAIN NOTIONS OF IMPUNITY, BUT, IN THE END, EVERYONE IS CULPABLE." IT SAYS A SUCCESSION OF $100.000 PAYMENTS WILL BE COLLECTED. HE GETS THESE LETTERS WHICH LAY OUT A MAZE, AND AT THE END OF THE MAZE, HE MAKES THE DROP. HE'S DONE IT 7 TIMES SO FAR. HE GAVE ME COPIES OF ALL THE LETTERS WHICH ARE IN A FILE THAT I'M PUTTING IN YOUR BRIEFCASE WITH THE CASE FILE. NOW THERE'S A DROP SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW. I TOLD HIM, UNLESS HE HEARD OTHERWISE FROM ME, HE SHOULD PLAN TO GO THROUGH WITH IT. THERE'S A PRETTY SEVERE "LACK OF INFORMATION" PROBLEM HERE, AND HE WON'T SAY MUCH. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE? I TOLD HIM IT'S NO USE LYING TO YOU. EVENTUALLY, YOU ALWAYS FIGURE IT OUT. HE'S JUST SLOWING THINGS DOWN. DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT THE CASE OF THE GUY WHO LIED ABOUT HIS AGE? OF COURSE. WAS HE IMPRESSED? MM-HMM. REALLY IMPRESSED? FUCKING FLABBERGASTED. I THINK IF YOU'RE BIG ENOUGH TO LOOK TRUTHFULLY, YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU MAYBE MOVED IN WITH HER A LITTLE PREMATURELY. WHAT? YOU HEARD ME. YOUR PROBLEMS WITH JESS AREN'T MY FAULT. COULD WE PLEASE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS NOW, DARYL? YOU'RE JUST NOT READY TO GET MARRIED YET. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD MAYBE LOOK AT THAT. PLEASE? ALL RIGHT. I'M THINKING MAYBE I SHOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH HODGEMEYER FOR THIS CASE. WHAT? RESERVATION FOR HODGEMEYER, MITCHELL HODGEMEYER. THIS GUY'S GONNA BE A PAIN IN THE ASS. SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH BANK IT IS. SO, WE GOT ONE SHOT TO BREAK THROUGH THIS. TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THAT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF IT. EASY ENOUGH. IT IS NOT WITHOUT SERIOUS RESERVATION THAT I SIT DOWN TO BEGIN THE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF DOCUMENTING MY OWN METHODS. IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT SOMEONE ELSE SHOULD DO IT. UNFORTUNATELY, MY FAITHFUL LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE HAS SHOWN NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER. AND SO I AM FORCED TO TAKE ON THE TASK MYSELF. WITH NO INTENTION OF GLORIFYING OR AGGRANDIZING OR IMMORTALIZING MY OWN MEMORY, BUT RATHER IN THE HOPE THAT SUCH A MEMOIR MIGHT SOMEDAY BE USEFUL TO OTHERS, I BEGIN MY EXAMINATION OF THE METHOD. I ALWAYS SAY THAT THE ESSENCE OF MY WORK RELIES FUNDAMENTALLY ON 2 BASIC PRINCIPLES... OBJECTIVITY AND OBSERVATION, OR "THE 2 OBS" AS I CALL THEM. MY WORK RELIES ON MY ABILITY TO REMAIN ABSOLUTELY, PURELY OBJECTIVE, DETACHED. I HAVE MASTERED THE FINE ART OF DETACHMENT. AND WHILE IT COMES AT SOME COST, THIS SUPREME OBJECTIVITY IS WHAT MAKES ME, I DARE SAY, THE GREATEST OBSERVER THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. # CARRIE, DID YA SEE ME # JUMPIN' UP AND DOWN IN THE FRONT ROW? # CARRIE, I LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE # I LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE, AND NOW I'M BLIND # TAKE ME, I'M LIVIN' SO FREE # I JUST WANNA PUT YOU IN MY DIARY... OBSERVING A SUBJECT, PARTICULARLY A CLIENT, IN HIS OR HER OWN ELEMENT IS USUALLY VERY TELLING. BEHAVIOR IS ALWAYS MORE REVEALING THAN LANGUAGE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR. NO RAIN. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT? WHAT? YOU TALKING TO ME? I SAID, WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT FINALLY STOPPED RAINING? OH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE, IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING? ABOUT A LEVEL 8? WHAT? ARE YOU DOING ABOUT AN 8? NO. 7. 7? THAT'S FUNNY. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. HMM? WHAT? NOTHING. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. NAME'S CARMINE. NICK CARMINE. GREG STARK. REAL PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, STARK. LIKEWISE. WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, SINCE MAXWELL'S GONE, WE DON'T HAVE A FAST BREAK, AND I CAN'T THINK OF A TEAM THAT'S EVER GOTTEN TO THE FINALS WITHOUT A FAST BREAK. THE CELTICS OF THE MID-EIGHTIES. THEY HAD NO FAST BREAK. THAT'S TRUE. THEY WERE A SLOW TEAM. ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTING TEAMS I EVER SAW. I SHOULD KNOW. I WENT TO SCHOOL IN CAMBRIDGE. THE STARKS ARE A WHOLE DYNASTY OF CELTICS FANS. HUH. THIS IS MY GOOD FRIEND GERALD AUERBACK. NICK CARMINE. SO, HOW WAS EVERYTHING FOR YOU, MR. CARMINE? TERRIFIC. DAISY, I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD BOOK A MASSAGE FOR TOMORROW MORNING. SURE. NO PROBLEM. BETSY COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. BETSY IS EXCELLENT. AHH. HOW ABOUT 9:00? UH, BETSY HAS A REGULAR APPOINTMENT EVERY MORNING AT 9:00. HOW ABOUT 10:00? OH. THAT'S THE TIME I WANTED. SORRY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU BEAT ME TO IT. ARE YOU A PARAMEDIC? YES. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? JUST A HUNCH. JUST A HUNCH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, JUST A HUNCH? HOW DID YOU KNOW? I'M VERY INTUITIVE. AH. GIVE THIS LADY THE 10:00 MASSAGE. NO. YOU TAKE IT. I THINK YOU NEED IT MORE THAN I DO. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WHAT'D SHE MEAN? UH, WHO WAS THAT? HER NAME IS GLORIA SULLIVAN. SHE'S NOT MARRIED. FANTASTIC. WAIT AT THE END. HELLO, STEVE ARLO. I REALLY HOPE YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED. YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL. BECAUSE WE NEED TO TALK NOW. FIRST OF ALL, HOW WAS YOUR TRIP? FINE. GOOD. ALL RIGHT. I JUST LEFT STARK AT THE GYM. SOME MAJOR REVELATIONS. THE GUY'S A MESS. SOMEBODY'S HOLDING SOMETHING REALLY SERIOUS OVER HIS HEAD, AND I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH MONEY. HE DOESN'T MOVE LIKE A WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINAL. YOU SHOULD SEE THE WAY HE WALKS. HIS SHOULDERS RIDE AT EAR LEVEL. ALSO HE CUT HIMSELF SHAVING 3 TIMES IN THE LAST 10 DAYS OR SO. THESE ARE SYMPTOMS OF A DEEPLY INGRAINED PARANOID FEAR... FEAR OF BEING FOUND OUT. I GET ON THE TREADMILL NEXT TO HIS, AND I GET MY MACHINE GOING AT HIS EXACT PACE. EVENTUALLY I ASK HIM WHAT LEVEL IS HE RUNNING AT. I GUESS 8. HE SAYS, "LEVEL 7." I'M RUNNING AT THE SAME SPEED HE IS, LEVEL 5. HE'D SOONER LIE TO A COMPLETE STRANGER THAN TO ADMIT TO BEING 3 LEVELS BELOW MY GUESS. AS SOON AS I TALK TO HIM, HE RUNS THE OTHER WAY. IT'S CONDITIONING, THOUGH, A REFLEX. HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T THINK TO CONNECT ME TO THE BLACKMAIL BUSINESS AT ALL. IF HE HAD SUSPECTED ME, HE WOULD'VE REMEMBERED MY NAME, WHICH HE DIDN'T. ALSO, LIKE MOST IVY LEAGUE GRADUATES, HE DROPS HIS ALMA MATER WITH ALMOST NO PROMPTING WHATSOEVER. I SAY CELTICS, HE SAYS CAMBRIDGE. OH, YEAH, THE GENTLEMAN PREFERS REDHEADS. HE LUSTS AFTER HIS RED-HAIRED MASSEUSE. YOU CAN TELL BY THE WAY HE TAKES HIS MASSAGE. IT'S MORE THAN A LITTLE EROTICIZED. HE DOES IT EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE SAME WOMAN. OH, I FOUND AN OLD E-MAIL MESSAGE FROM CLEARBURG. KIND OF CRYPTIC. NOTE SAID... K.V. ARE OBVIOUSLY INITIALS. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY STAND FOR. LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE? AH... THAT'S THE IMPORTANT STUFF. DARYL... SHH. SERGIO. SERGIO KNIGHT. RIGHT. WHATEVER. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? WHAT'S THAT? WHY ARE WE TALKING ON THE PHONE? I TOLD YOU. WE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL. 2 GUYS... IN AN AIRPORT... TALKING? IT'S A LITTLE FISHY. WELL, WHY ARE WE EVEN IN AN AIRPORT? WHY DON'T WE JUST LEAVE? OK, I SEE THE CONFUSION. SEE, I NEED MORE RESEARCH. I NEED YOU TO GO BACK TO L.A. AND GET IN THE COMPUTER AND GET SOME THINGS. AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE, I NEED YOU TO BREAK INTO CLEARBURG'S COMPUTER AND PULL ANYTHING PERTINENT. I'VE WRITTEN OUT ELABORATE DIRECTIONS. THEY'RE IN AN ENVELOPE IN THE PHONE BOOK. IN FRONT OF YOU. TURN TO RENTALS. AND I'LL MEET YOU AT THE MOTEL TONIGHT WHEN YOU GET BACK. WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT INSTEAD OF CALLING ME, YOU HAD ME FLY UP HERE SO YOU COULD TELL ME TO GO STRAIGHT BACK TO THE COMPUTER AND THEN FLY BACK AGAIN TONIGHT? YEAH, WELL, IT WASN'T AN EMERGENCY, AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO RISK THE LONG-DISTANCE LINES. THEY'D LISTEN, YOU KNOW. MMPFFH! STEVE... ARE YOU STILL THERE? HEY, STEVE. NO. Daryl: HERE WE GO. TRANSACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS MONDAY NIGHT. MR. STARK. $100.000 CASH TRANSPORTED IN A DISCREET BLACK LEATHER BAG THAT YOU SHALL PROVIDE FOR YOURSELF. WEAR YOUR BUSINESS SUIT AND YOUR GRAY OVERCOAT. CARRY THE ENCLOSED PAGER SET TO THE INAUDIBLE VIBRATING RESPONSE. GO ABOUT YOUR DAY PER USUAL. GO TO THE GYM, THEN THE OFFICE. ARRANGE TO LEAVE THE OFFICE AT 5 P.M. YOUR COURSE IS AS FOLLOWS: NUMBER ONE... AT 5:30 P.M., BE AT THE INTERSECTION OF POWELL AND GREEN IN YOUR BENTLEY WITH THE CASH. 2... WHEN THE CLOCK IN YOUR CAR READS 5:34, BEGIN DRIVING NORTHBOUND ON POWELL. NUMBER 3... PAGER WILL GO OFF, DISPLAYING 6 DIGITS. WHEN YOUR VEHICLE'S ODOMETER READS THE SAME OVERALL MILEAGE, PULL OVER AND PARK. A.S.A.P. NUMBER 4... FUNDS IN HAND, WALK TO THE NEAREST BUS STOP, SAME SIDE OF THE STREET. GET ON THE NEXT BUS. 5... PAGER WILL DELIVER A 3-DIGIT NUMBER. GET OFF THE BUS AT THE NEXT STOP, CROSS THE STREET... GET ON THE TRAIN WITH THE PAINTED NUMBER THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE PAGER MESSAGE.

WALK OUTSIDE AND TRIP THE NEAREST FIRE ALARM, THEN LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. YOU HAVE 3 MINUTES TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING FROM THE TIME YOU ENTER. YOU ARE NOT TO BE ACCOMPANIED. YOU'RE NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. YOUR COMPLETE COOPERATION.. BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. A FEW WORDS HERE ABOUT FOLLOWING PEOPLE. PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE BEING FOLLOWED WHEN THEY TURN AROUND AND SEE SOMEONE FOLLOWING THEM. THEY CAN'T TELL THEY'RE BEING FOLLOWED IF YOU GET THERE FIRST. OK, FOLKS, THAT'S THE FIRE ALARM. EVERYBODY HAS TO GET OUT OF THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW. PLEASE DO NOT RUN! WAIT, KIDS, JUST SLOW DOWN. WALK. WALK. EVERYBODY, COME ON, FILE OUT. EVERYONE MUST LEAVE THE BUILDING. WALK IN AN ORDERLY FASHION TO THE NEAREST EXIT. EVERYBODY OUT NOW. THAT'S THE FIRE ALARM.

YOU ARLO? YEAH, THAT OTHER GUY LEFT THIS FOR YOU, THAT OLSON. WHAT A STRANGE PERSONALITY, THAT OLSON. Daryl: I CAN'T POSSIBLY OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD RESEARCH. EVERYONE GOES THROUGH LIFE DROPPING CRUMBS. IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THE CRUMBS, YOU CAN TRACE A PATH ALL THE WAY BACK FROM YOUR DEATH CERTIFICATE TO THE DINNER-AND-A-MOVIE THAT RESULTED IN YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. BUT RESEARCH IS AN ART, NOT A SCIENCE, BECAUSE ANYONE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING CAN FIND THE CRUMBS: THE WHERES, WHATS, AND WHOS. THE ART IS IN THE WHYS. THE ABILITY TO READ BETWEEN THE CRUMBS... NOT TO MIX METAPHORS. FOR EVERY EVENT, THERE IS A CAUSE AND EFFECT; FOR EVERY CRIME, A MOTIVE; AND FOR EVERY MOTIVE, A PASSION. THE ART OF RESEARCH IS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE DETAILS AND SEE THE PASSION. HEY. HEY. EXCUSE ME. OK, SO YOU HAVE TO TELL ME NOW. YESTERDAY HOW COULD YOU TELL THAT I WAS A PARAMEDIC? UH, YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW? YEAH. I COULD SMELL IT. OH. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I COULD SMELL IODINE. THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC SCENT THAT'S UNIQUE LARGELY TO AMBULANCES AND HOSPITALS, AND, UH, I... I COULD SEE THAT YOUR HAIR HAD BEEN WET BUT DRIED NATURALLY, BUT SINCE I COULD SMELL THE IODINE, I KNEW THAT YOU HADN'T GONE HOME AND BATHED OR SCRUBBED DOWN SINCE YOUR LAST SHIFT, AND THEN I ASSUMED THAT YOU HAD WORKED THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN IT WAS RAINING, AND... AND THEN I FIGURED PARAMEDIC, NOT DOCTOR OR NURSE. THAT'S HOW I... JUST KINDA GUESSED. WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT, UH... EACH PART. HMM. DO YOU, UH... ENJOY THAT WORK? SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES? YEAH. IT CAN BE A THRILL. WHEN YOU RUSH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING, SOME CHAOTIC MESS, AND GET INVOLVED, INTERVENE, MAYBE HELP SOMEBODY, MAYBE REVIVE THEIR BODY. SOME OF IT'S JUST BORING, THOUGH. THE HOURS ARE TERRIBLE. 12- AND 18-HOUR SHIFTS. OK, I'M JUST RAMBLING NOW SO... OH, NO, THAT'S, UH... THAT'S... INTERESTING TO ME. WHAT ABOUT YOU? DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE? "DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?" STUPID QUESTION. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE? NO, THAT'S OK. UH... I'M ONLY HERE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS ON BUSINESS. SO YOU'RE WITH THAT CONFERENCE? YES. SO YOU'RE AN ACCOUNTANT. YEP. UH, THAT'S PRETTY EXCITING, I KNOW. WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT... ALL THE FORMS, ALL THE TIME. THE FORMS GROW ON YOU. WHERE DO YOU LIVE? NICK... I KNOW. NICK CARMINE. DAISY, THE FRONT DESK. SHE TOLD ME. Woman on TV: WELL, WE WERE EMPLOYING THE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BUCKET PRINCIPLE, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN... WHOO... AHH! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THESE CURTAINS? AND THESE OVER HERE. AHH. FUCKING WHALES? FUCK THE WHALES. OH, I'M A MESS. ALL THAT FUCKING EXERCISE. MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP SNORTING THAT SHIT. AH, IT KEEPS MY TEETH SHARP. SO, I WENT BACK TO L.A. AND GOT THAT STUFF YOU SENT ME TO GET. BUT SINCE YOU THEN WENT BACK TO L.A. YOURSELF, PROBABLY DON'T NEED THAT ANYMORE. DID YOU SEE THAT POEM THAT STARK WROTE IN COLLEGE, AN ODE TO CLARISSA? THAT'S THE WORST POETRY I'VE READ SINCE THE CASE OF THE SHRINKING GYPSY STRIPPER'S SCRIBBLINGS. TELL ME THIS: HOW DO YOU RHYME "TOWARDS" AND "BIRDS"? "DROPPING, FALLING, DIVING TOWARDS... 2 LOVERS LOST, PLUMMETING... BIRDS"? THEY DON'T RHYME. MAYBE IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO RHYME. ALSO... HOW DO YOU WRITE A POEM ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED CLARISSA AND NEVER HAVE THE NAME IN THE POEM? IF EVER THERE WAS A NAME THAT DESERVED AND BEGGED TO BE IN A POEM, IT'S CLARISSA. ANYWAY, I DID THAT PHONE BOOK-DATABASE CROSS-REFERENCE THING YOU ASKED FOR, AND THERE ARE 1.800 MEN IN OREGON WITH THE INITIALS K.V. AND ABOUT A MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES THAT ARE LISTED. HOW ABOUT YOU? YOU HAVE ANY LUCK ON YOUR END? UNH... I FOUND THE BLACKMAILER. YOU DID? YEAH. HER NAME IS GLORIA SULLIVAN. AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S HER? I WATCHED HER... WALK INTO THE BATHROOM AND GET THE MONEY. I HAVE TO ADMIT, I WAS A BIT SURPRISED. I HAD A FEW GUESSES ABOUT SUSPECTS, BUT I NEVER... I MEAN I DIDN'T EVEN THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT GIRL. SO, UH, WHAT'S HER DEAL? HER DEAL? HER DEAL IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY ABOUT HER. SHE'S A MODEL CITIZEN, SHE'S A COLLEGE GRADUATE, SHE'S A GOOD PARAMEDIC, SHE VOLUNTEERS AT A HOSPITAL FOR THE ELDERLY, SHE HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD. I MEAN, SHE'S VERY EVEN-TEMPERED. SHE'S FRIENDLY, EAGER TO CHAT. THERE'S NO NERVOUSNESS ABOUT HER, WHICH IS ODD FOR A BLACKMAILER. EVEN AT THE PICKUP YESTERDAY, SHE'S JUST... SHE'S VERY COOL. SHE'S VERY COOL. BUT THERE IS A DEFINITE INTENSITY ABOUT HER. SHE LOOKS YOU RIGHT IN THE EYE, SORT OF A SENSUAL QUALITY. VERY PERSONABLE. A NICE SENSE OF HUMOR... AND ACTUALLY VERY CHARMING. CHARMING? DID YOU JUST SAY "CHARMING"? YEAH. HMM. AND THEN GET STARK OUT OF THE OFFICE. MAKE PLANS FOR HIM TO PAY AT 5:00 TONIGHT. AAH. SO MAYBE YOU COULD, UH, GO HOME FOR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS. COUPLE OF NIGHTS? WELL, AREN'T WE FINISHED NOW? YOU FOUND THE BLACKMAILER, RIGHT? ALL HE WANTED WAS THE NAME. WE'RE NOT DONE YET. FIRST I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HER DEAL IS. IS THIS YOUR KID? NOPE. JUST A RENTAL. YOU GOT THE MONEY? YEAH, IT'S IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR, THE FIRST THIRD. BYE! BYE! YOU WANT A TURN? DOES HE KNOW WHO'S DOING THIS TO ME? I CAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING YET. NOTHING. IT'S TOO SOON. IT COULD INTERFERE WITH THE INVESTIGATION. JESUS. OK, SO HERE'S HOW THIS IS GONNA WORK. DID YOU GIVE YOUR CAR TO THE VALET OVER THERE LIKE I ASKED? YEAH. GOOD. NOW, WHEN WE GET DOWN HERE OUT OF SIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME YOUR VALET TICKET, AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE. THEN YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THE RESTAURANT. YOU'RE GONNA ORDER SOMETHING TO EAT. WAIT A MINUTE, I JUST HAD A LATE LUNCH. I'M NOT HUNGRY. THEN ORDER SOMETHING LIGHT, LIKE A SALAD. WHEN YOU'RE DONE, GIVE THE VALET YOUR TICKET. HE'LL BRING YOU A CAR IDENTICAL TO YOUR OWN. FOLLOW THE MAP IN THE GLOVE BOX. IT'LL LEAD YOU BACK TO YOUR OWN CAR, WHICH I'LL HAVE DRIVEN THERE AND TAKEN OUR MONEY OUT OF. THE KEYS WILL BE IN THE VISOR. NOW, BEFORE WE DO THIS, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL MR. ZERO THAT MIGHT MAKE HIS JOB A LITTLE BIT EASIER? WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND? LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT'S IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX AND WHERE IS IT? I TOLD YOU. THAT IS NOT PERTINENT TO HIS TASK. K.V. NOW... A FEW WORDS ON LOOKING FOR THINGS. WHEN YOU GO LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC, YOUR CHANCES OF FINDING IT ARE VERY BAD... BECAUSE, OF ALL THE THINGS IN THE WORLD, YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING FOR ONE OF THEM. WHEN YOU GO LOOKING FOR ANYTHING AT ALL, YOUR CHANCES OF FINDING IT ARE VERY GOOD... BECAUSE, OF ALL THE THINGS IN THE WORLD, YOU'RE SURE TO FIND SOME OF THEM. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE... OFTEN THE THING YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE. Daryl: THERE HE IS. Steve: MMM. I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS THING FOR REDHEADS, RIGHT? GUESS WHAT COLOR HAIR HIS SECRETARY HAS. HMM... RED? MEN ARE SO PREDICTABLE. SO DID YOU FIND ANYTHING USEFUL? A GOLD MINE. FIRST OF ALL, I GOT A FULL NAME ON THAT BOXER THAT CLEARBURG COULDN'T FIND. KRAGAN VINCENT. K.V. IT WAS ON A LETTER FROM OUR BLACKMAILER TO OUR BLACKMAILEE. "I WARN YOU ONCE, STAY AWAY FROM KRAGAN VINCENT." HE SAID HE GAVE US ALL THE LETTERS. DIDN'T GIVE US THAT ONE. MR. STARK APPARENTLY DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW ABOUT KRAGAN VINCENT. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO HE IS AND WHERE. OK. KRAGAN VINCENT. I DID FIND ONE OTHER THING OF INTEREST, THOUGH. HOLY SHIT! THOSE ARE THE KEYS. YOU FOUND THE GOLD SWISS ARMY KNIFE. I KNOW. AND THIS IS THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX KEY. WHERE'D YOU FIND THEM? THEY WERE IN THE SOFA UNDER THE CUSHION. WHAT? THEY WERE STUCK IN THE COUCH IN HIS OFFICE. WAS HE HIDING THEM THERE? IS THAT POSSIBLE? NO. NOT POSSIBLE. THAT'S WHERE THEY FELL OUT OF HIS POCKET OVER A YEAR AGO. SO... WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? I THINK, JUST AS I FEARED, MS. SULLIVAN DOESN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT THESE KEYS. WHAT, THE KEYS ARE A COINCIDENCE? YES. THAT'S... CONFUSING. YUP. HMM. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GOOD THING. SURE IT IS. IT'S GOOD BECAUSE THE MAN HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR HIS KEYS FOR A YEAR, AND I'VE FOUND THEM. NOW I'M GONNA GO HOME, SO TELL ME YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT ME TO COME BACK HERE TOMORROW AFTERNOON BECAUSE I COULD CHECK OUT THIS KRAGAN VINCENT GUY... I WON'T NEED YOU TOMORROW. I'M TRUSTING YOU HERE, DARYL. HAVE A NICE TRIP. # IT'S COLD AND DARK IN MY HEART # SAID IT'S COLD AND DARK IN MY HEART # MAMA HEY. HI. LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS, UM, TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE, BUT... NEVER MIND. WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU, DON'T YOU? WHAT? IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN GET YOU TO LOOK OVER MY TAX RETURNS? YEAH. ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU CAN SPEAK 6 LANGUAGES AND FLY A JETLINER, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO FILE A TAX RETURN? IT'S NEVER COME UP. DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN RIGHT NOW? MMM... NO, THAT'S A W-2. W-W-2 IS THE SECOND WORLD WAR. HERE IT IS. MY HUMBLE... PALACE. IT'S VERY NICE. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE? 3 YEARS. OH. THAT'S... THAT'S SOMETHING. SO YOU GONNA NEED A CALCULATOR? UM... YEAH. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. OK. YOU'RE AN ACCOUNTANT... SO YOU WOULD KNOW. WHAT IS THE CORRODIUM 3 DEDUCTION? THE CORRODIUM 3 DEDUCTION. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE... THAT, IN FACT, IS PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY MISUNDERSTOOD... DEDUCTION IN THE BOOK. REALLY. INDEED. THE CORRODIUM 3 DEDUCTION IS AN INCENTIVE USED BY LARGE MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE ABLE TO MODERATE THEIR USE OF CLASS-3 DECAY TOXINS, SUCH AS... CORRODIUM AND... MALGORIUM. ANYTHING ELSE? NO. ALL RIGHT. TIME TO GET DIRTY. SO, ABOUT HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE? UM... WELL, A L... A LITTLE WHILE. WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WAS, UH... GONNA TAKE A NAP. OH. OK. YOU SURE IT'S OK? YEP. I'LL JUST, UH... BE HERE. SO JUST YELL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE. OK. HOW'S IT GOIN' OVER THERE? JUST ANOTHER MINUTE. I'M... RECHECKING MY MATH. YOU REALLY OUGHT TO TRY TO KEEP ALL YOUR RECEIPTS... FOR EVERYTHING. I KNOW. I NEVER REMEMBER THAT. JUST... PUT 'EM IN AN ENVELOPE. THAT'S THE THING TO DO. I TRY TO KEEP ALL MY RECEIPTS, AND... IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HABIT NOW. I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. YOU REALLY HELPED ME OUT THERE. THAT'S... REALLY MY PLEASURE. OK, LISTEN... LET ME MAKE YOU DINNER. OHHH... NO. YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. NO, I INSIST. JUST GONNA HOP IN THE SHOWER REAL QUICK. THEN I'LL MAKE US SOME FOOD. ALL RIGHT. RETIRE... D. JESUS. THAT'S ANOTHER 7-LETTER WORD. 17 PLUS 50... 67 POINTS. RETIRE. WHAT? RETIRE. JESS, IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE. WHY IS IT NOT THAT SIMPLE, STEVE? WHENEVER YOU SAY THAT, IT... IT... JUST CREEPS ME OUT. I TOLD YOU. IT'S NOTHING... WEIRD. I MEAN, OK, YES, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD, BUT IT'S NOTHING CREEPY... EXACTLY. SO WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS? I MEAN, WHAT... WHAT KIND OF A HOLD DOES THIS GUY, WHOEVER HE IS, HAVE ON YOU? WELL... HE NEEDS ME. HE NEEDS YOU. WHO NEEDS WHO? I NEED YOU. IT'S TIME TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, STEVE. OK. I'LL DO IT TOMORROW WHEN I GET THERE. IF... YOU... WILL MARRY ME. MARRY ME. OHHH... OHHH... ABSOLUTELY VITAL. THE ABILITY TO BLEND IN. TO VERY DISCREETLY ASSIMILATE. IT'S NOT USUALLY VERY DIFFICULT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AROUND, SEE HOW ALL THE ORDINARY PEOPLE AROUND YOU ARE BEHAVING AND TRY TO BEHAVE LIKE ONE OF THEM. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS IN L.A., IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH A LONELY TOWN. EVERYBODY'S DRIVIN' AROUND IN THEIR CARS. NOBODY TALKS TO EACH OTHER. MMM... I DON'T REALLY KNOW, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH... UH... ABOUT THAT. SO, WHERE YOU FROM? ORIGINALLY? MINNESOTA. MINNESOTA. I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE. DO YOU GO BACK THERE MUCH? NO. DO YOU STILL HAVE FAMILY THERE? UH... WE'RE NOT REALLY IN TOUCH. YEAH. SO... WHAT WERE YOU DOIN' IN L.A.? OH, I WAS THERE... TWICE. ONCE WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I WAS THERE WITH MY AUNT AND UNCLE. I WAS RAISED BY MY AUNT AND UNCLE. THEY ADOPTED ME. UM... THEN LAST YEAR, I WAS THERE SKYDIVING. SKYDIVING? YEAH. UH, WHY DO YOU DO THAT? BECAUSE I LOVE IT. IT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING IN THE WORLD. AREN'T YOU AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA DIE OR SOMETHING? I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED. OK. TRY AGAIN. TAKE YOUR TIME, NOW. REALLY SET YOURSELF. REMEMBER TO BEND YOUR ELBOWS A LITTLE. A LITTLE LESS. KEEP THE RIGHT ARM STRAIGHT WITH THE LEFT ELBOW. CHECK YOUR AIM AGAIN. THEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME? WHENEVER I CAN. I FIND IT DEEPLY SATISFYING. NICE. YOU TRY AGAIN. TAKE YOUR TIME. DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT. IT'S SAFE JUST AS LONG AS YOU'RE CAREFUL. IT'S ALL ABOUT STAYING RELAXED. SORRY. That's OK. Yeah. Just relax. BEND THIS A LITTLE. KEEP THIS STRAIGHT. HIPS BACK A LITTLE. LEAN INTO IT. CONNECT TO IT. CHECK YOUR AIM AGAIN. RELAX. NOW FIRE. THERE YOU GO. THAT FEEL GOOD? SSHHH. YEAH. WANT TO TRY A SHOTGUN? SURE. WANT TO JUST STAY AT MY PLACE TONIGHT? OH. I MEAN, YOU... YOU DON'T HAVE TO. IT'S JUST... BUT THE COUCH FOLDS OUT. IT'S JUST... I WAS... THOUGHT IT'D BE SILLY TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK TO MY PLACE, THEN YOU'D HAVE TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY BACK ACROSS TOWN JUST TO SOME CRUMMY OLD MOTEL. UH, WELL, UH... OK. THAT'D BE GREAT. GOOD. I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU A RECEIPT. YOU CAN WRITE IT OFF. YOU KNOW MY MOTTO. YOU ALWAYS TAKE THE RECEIPT. YOU SLEPT AT HER HOUSE? SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER THAN DRIVING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE MOTEL. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SLEPT AT HER HOUSE. I... I CAN'T BELIEVE WITH ALL THAT TIME WITH HER, I COULDN'T TELL MORE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HER HEAD. I COULDN'T TELL WHAT SHE WAS THINKING. WELL, THAT'S USUALLY HOW IT IS IN THE BEGINNING. MAYBE I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE MORE TONIGHT AT DINNER. YOU'RE TAKING HER TO DINNER. WHAT WAS I GONNA SAY? NO? YOU GOT ANYTHING MORE ON KRAGAN VINCENT? YEAH. THERE'S A KRAGAN VINCENT SERVING TIME AT THE STATE PENITENTIARY. A LIFE SENTENCE. PRISON RECORDS DIDN'T SAY WHAT FOR, THOUGH. BETTER GO FIND OUT. ANYTHING ELSE? WHAT IS IT? NOTHIN'. MMM. AHEM. YEAH? ARE YOU THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF RECORDS? I'M HIM. LIEUTENANT EARL HAGANS. STEVE ARLO. MIND IF I COME IN? WHAT IS THIS REGARDING, MR. ARLO? I WORK FOR A PRIVATE DETECTIVE. THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT SHARE RECORDS WITH P.I.s EXCEPT BY COURT ORDER. IT'S POLICY. I ASSUME THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE A COURT ORDER. I WORK FOR A PRIVATE DETECTIVE NAMED DARYL ZERO. MURDER ONE IN 1972. SINGLE COUNT. AND GUESS WHAT THE VICTIM'S NAME IS. UH, LET ME GUESS. NO, I DON'T MEAN REALLY GUESS. NO WAY YOU COULD ACTUALLY GUESS. CLARISSA. YEAH. CLARISSA DEVEREAU. OF PLUMMETING BIRDS FAME. SEEMS LIKELY, DOESN'T IT? SEEMS VERY LIKELY. 2 SHOTS. ONE TO THE HEAD, ONE TO THE TORSO. DOWN SHE GOES, EXECUTION STYLE IN HER MOTEL ROOM. MMM. SOUNDS PROFESSIONAL. YEAH, EXCEPT HE MADE A COMPLETE MESS. LEFT A TON OF EVIDENCE. LEFT PRINTS ON EVERYTHING. I GOT COPIES OF THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS. REMEMBER THE CASE OF THE HIRED GUN WHO MADE WAY, WAY TOO MANY MISTAKES? YEAH. IT'S A LOT LIKE THAT. SO THEY PICK HIM UP, THEY TRY HIM, GIVE HIM LIFE, NO PAROLE. OPEN AND SHUT. EVERYBODY THINKS HE'S WORKIN' FOR SOMEONE, BUT HE WON'T TALK, EVEN WHEN THEY OFFER HIM A DEAL. AS FOR CLARISSA, SHE HAS QUITE AN ARREST RECORD FOR A YOUNG GIRL. MOSTLY POLITICAL. NEW YORK AND BOSTON. DISTURBING THE PEACE. PUBLIC INDECENCY. ONE FOR BREAKING AND ENTERING. A REGULAR FIRECRACKER. A REGULAR PLUMMETING BIRD. AND VINCENT'S STILL IN JAIL. NO. HE MUST HAVE SOME SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION, 'CAUSE HE WAS MOVED FOR MEDICAL REASONS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.WHAT? Daryl: KRAGAN IS HER FATHER. SHE WAS RAISED BY HIS SISTER BECAUSE HE WAS IN PRISON. SHE BLAMES STARK FOR RUINING HER FATHER'S LIFE. STARK HIRED VINCENT TO KILL CLARISSA FOR SOME REASON. VINCENT GOT CAUGHT, SPENT HIS LIFE IN PRISON. NOW HE'S DYING THIS... SLOW, PAINFUL DEATH. SHE'S WATCHED HER FATHER'S LIFE DRIP AWAY, AND SHE'S GETTING EVEN. SHE HAS SOMETHING... SOME EVIDENCE OR SOMETHING THAT TIES STARK TO THE MURDER. I GOTTA FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS, WHERE SHE'S KEEPING IT. TAKE ME... TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. IT'S... RIGHT, UP HERE. Daryl: READY. 1, 2, 3. UNH! ONCE MORE. THE BED WE JUST MOVED IS A FULL-SIZE BED. IN 1972, THERE WAS NO SIZE CALLED FULL. THEY HAD DOUBLES AND QUEENS. THE FULL WAS INVENTED TO COMBINE THE WIDTH OF A QUEEN WITH THE SPACE-EFFICIENT LENGTH OF A DOUBLE... AND EVENTUALLY REPLACED THE DOUBLE IN MOST OF NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE EXCEPT FOR QUEBEC AND, UH, SWEDEN. THE BED IN THE PICTURE... IS NOT A DOUBLE. IT'S TOO LONG. IT'S NOT A FULL. IT WASN'T INVENTED. IT IS A QUEEN. YEAH? WHICH MEANS THAT THAT BED THEN WAS LONGER THAN THIS BED NOW. SO SOMETIME IN THE LAST 30 YEARS, SOMEBODY MUST'VE REPLACED THE BED. HEAR THAT? SECRET ROOM? IT'S A PIPE. THERE ONCE WAS A RADIANT WATER HEATER RIGHT THERE. SO! KRAGAN BURSTS INTO THE ROOM. THE BODY WAS FOUND FACE-UP, SO SHE MUST'VE BEEN FACING HIM, WHICH MEANS THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY STANDING PRETTY CLOSE TO WHERE YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT NOW. RIGHT AWAY, BEFORE SHE COULD SCREAM, POW, POW. SHE'S DOWN. SHE'S DEAD. IT'S OVER. THE ONLY QUESTION IS, ONCE SHE WAS DEAD... WHY DIDN'T HE GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE? INSTEAD, HE PROCEEDS TO TOUCH THE DRESSER... THE SINK, THE DOORKNOB, AND THE NIGHT STAND. SO WHAT DOES THE BED HAVE TO DO WITH IT? IN 1972, IT WAS AGAINST CODE TO HAVE A HOTEL BED 2 FEET FROM A DOOR THAT OPENS INWARDS, 7 FEET FROM A FISH TANK OR A LAVA LAMP, OR 3 FEET FROM A RADIANT HEATER. IMAGINE, IF YOU WILL, A BED LONGER THAN THIS ONE AND A HEATER OVER HERE. THAT WOULDN'T CLEAR 2 FEET, MUCH LESS 3, AND NO INSPECTOR WOULD LET THAT PASS. WHICH MEANS? WHICH MEANS... KRAGAN MAY HAVE MOVED THE BED. OH, I SEE. SO YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT HE BUSTS IN THE ROOM, SEES HER STANDING THERE, SHOOTS HER TWICE... MOVES THE BED. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT? HELLO! I DON'T KNOW. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT KRAGAN MIGHT'VE TAKEN FROM THE CRIME SCENE THAT HE GAVE TO HIS DAUGHTER YEARS LATER SO THAT SHE COULD BLACKMAIL STARK. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS ABSENT. SOMETHING HAPPENED IN HERE. I MEAN, SOMETHING THAT INVOLVED HIM TOUCHING THE DRESSER, TOUCHING THE SINK, TOUCHING THE DOORKNOB, AND TOUCHING THE NIGHT STAND, AND... PROBABLY MOVING THE BED. PROBABLY? SOMEBODY ELSE COULD'VE MOVED IT. COME ON. THERE WERE ONLY 2 OF THEM... HIM AND HER. EXACTLY. STEVE. YOU NEED TO TALK TO STARK. WE GOT A FEW QUESTIONS FOR HIM. I HAD A FEELING THAT YOU TWO WOULD BE A GOOD MATCH. I'M GOOD AT READING PEOPLE. THANK YOU. DO YOU WANT MY OPINION? YEAH. YOU SHOULD TRY TO HOLD ON TO HIM. I MEAN, HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET A WEALTHY, SINGLE ARCHITECT FROM LOS ANGELES? DAISY... HE'S AN ACCOUNTANT. ARE YOU SURE? YES. HE'S HERE FOR THE ACCOUNTANTS CONVENTION. THAT'S WHY I ASKED HIM TO DO MY TAXES. I SWEAR I THOUGHT HE SAID HE WAS AN ARCHITECT. QUESTION. OHH! SORRY TO STARTLE YOU.OH, JESUS. HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE THE WORD T-O-W-A-R-D-S? YOU KNOW YOU GAVE ME A HEART ATTACK? I NEEDED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU RIGHT AWAY. WHAT DO YOU NEED? I NEED TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS. JUST DRIVE. FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT. OK. FIRST OF ALL, HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE THE WORD T-O-W-A-R-D-S? TOWARDS? AND THINGS THAT HAVE WINGS AND FLY IN THE SKY? WHAT ARE THOSE CALLED? YOU MEAN BIRDS? THAT'S RIGHT. THEY DON'T RHYME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? NEVER MIND. OH, THE OTHER THING WAS, UM, WHY DID YOU KILL CLARISSA? I MET HER MY SOPHOMORE YEAR. I WAS 19. AND SHE WAS, UH, 25, I THINK. FROM NEW YORK, LIVING IN CAMBRIDGE. I MET HER AT A DEMONSTRATION. I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYBODY LIKE HER. SHE LET ME WALK HER HOME, AND SHE KISSED ME FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN JUST, UH, SKIP RIGHT TO THE PART WHERE YOU DECIDE TO KILL HER. WATCH YOURSELF, ARLO. MR. STARK, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING YOUR CONTRACTING HER MURDER. AFTER THAT FIRST NIGHT, I WAS... HOOKED. I WAS LIKE AN ADDICT. UH, FINALLY, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE ME ANYMORE, AND... I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE OBSESSIVE. UH... MY LAST YEAR OF GRADUATE SCHOOL, I MET MY WIFE. AND AFTER I GRADUATED, WE MOVED BACK HERE. WE GOT MARRIED. AND I WENT TO WORK WITH MY DAD AT THE COMPANY. AND I HAD ALL BUT FORGOTTEN ABOUT... CLARISSA. THEN, IN 1972... WE'D BEEN BACK ABOUT A YEAR... I, UH... GOT A LETTER FROM HER. SHE WAS HERE... IN PORTLAND. THE LETTER WAS A... IT... IT WAS A THREATENING LETTER. WHAT WAS IT? I DON'T THINK THAT MAKES A THREAD OF DIFFERENCE. MR. STARK... WHAT... DID THE LETTER SAY? SHE WAS ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING. RAPE. DID SHE WANT MONEY? NO. SHE WANTED TO RUIN MY LIFE. I KNEW NO JURY WOULD EVER CONVICT ME. I WAS CONVINCED OF THAT. BUT I COULDN'T TAKE THIS KIND OF PUBLICITY, NOR COULD MY FAMILY. YOU CAN IMAGINE. I SAW MY... MY WHOLE FUTURE FLASH BEFORE MY EYES. SO... YOU HIRED KRAGAN VINCENT. HE SAID THAT FOR $5.000... HE COULD SOLVE MY PROBLEM. AND THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT THE SUBJECT... OFFICER. SO, UH, WHAT'S IN THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOX? A TAPE. A TAPE HE MADE OF OUR MEETING. AUDIO TAPE. MY HIRING HIM. OUR NAMES AS CLEAR AS DAY. WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST DESTROY IT YEARS AGO? BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. GO ON. WELL, ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HE GETS CAUGHT, A MAN SHOWS UP AT MY HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND HE TELLS ME THAT KRAGAN EXPECTS ME TO BANKROLL HIS DEFENSE. THROUGH A MIDDLEMAN, OBVIOUSLY. AND HE ALSO WANTED MONEY FOR HIS FAMILY. AND THEN HE PLAYED ME A COPY OF HIS TAPE. AND SAID IF I REFUSED, HE WOULD TURN THE TAPE OVER TO THE POLICE. HE THEN GAVE ME A KEY TO A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX. SAID AT THE END OF 25 YEARS WHEN KRAGAN GOT OUT OR IF HE SHOULD DIE, I WOULD BE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THE BOX. AND IN THE MEANTIME, I'M TO HANG ONTO THIS KEY WITH NO LOCK AND OUR FRIEND WOULD HANG ONTO HIS LOCK WITH NO KEY. WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? SOMEONE WAS THREATENING YOU LIKE THAT AND BLACKMAILING YOU LIKE THIS. WHAT DO YOU DO? I DON'T KNOW. IT'S NEVER COME UP. WELL, IMAGINE IT. IMAGINE SOME OPPORTUNISTIC PIECE OF BIRD SHIT HAS GOT A WAY TO COMPROMISE YOU. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BUY SILENCE. YOU CAN ONLY RENT IT. SO IF SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING ON YOU, THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE IT. SO THE COST HAS NO CEILING. AND THE FEAR HAS NO END. THAT'S WHY... SOME KNOWLEDGE, SOME INFORMATION... IT'S LIKE A TERMINAL DISEASE. IT'S CONTAGIOUS AND IT'S FATAL. Daryl: PASSION IS THE ENEMY OF PRECISION. FORGET THE MISNOMER... CRIME OF PASSION. ALL CRIME IS PASSIONATE. THIS PASSION THAT MOVES THE CRIMINAL TO ACT, THAT DISRUPTS THE STATIC INERTIA OF MORALITY. THE CLIENT'S PASSION FOR THIS DEAD WOMAN HAD FACILITATED HIS DOWNFALL. AND THE BLACKMAILER'S PASSION WOULD FACILITATE HERS. WHEN YOU LIVE WITH NO PASSION AT ALL, OTHER PEOPLE'S PASSIONS COME INTO GLARING RELIEF. BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! JESUS, WOULD YOU STOP IT? OH, STOP IT! STOP IT! JESUS! CONTROL YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT? CONTROL MYSELF? IT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT, ARLO. HAVEN'T I BEEN GOOD TO YOU, HUH? HAVEN'T I BEEN FUCKING INCREDIBLY, MIND-BLOWINGLY, FUCKINGLY, DIVINELY GENEROUS AS A FUCKING SAINT. YOU UNGRATEFUL FUCK! OH, OH, HEY, WATCH IT, ALL RIGHT? UNGRATEFUL FUCK. SHUT UP! WHY? I TOLD YOU WHY. I CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE. I CAN'T DO IT TO JESS, I CAN'T DO IT TO MYSELF, AND I AM SICK AND TIRED OF WORKING FOR THE STARKS OF THE WORLD. THE LOWEST SCUM OF THE EARTH! BUYING THEIR WAY OUT OF THEIR OWN MESSES. THESE PEOPLE ARE VICTIMS OF PLOTS AND THEY NEED OUR HELP. THIS GUY IS A MURDERER-AT-LARGE WHO NEEDS OUR HELP. HEY, THEIR BUSINESS EQUALS THEIR BUSINESS. WE'RE NOT INVOLVED. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH US. YOU BELIEVE THAT? YEAH, WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS. WHAT ARE... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THERE AREN'T ANY GOOD GUYS. YOU REALIZE THAT, DON'T YOU? I MEAN YOU REALIZE THERE AREN'T EVIL GUYS AND INNOCENT GUYS. IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST... IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF GUYS. SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? JUST START TAKING MEETINGS WITH PEOPLE. JUST START TALKING WITH PEOPLE. MAYBE. FUCK THAT. YOU KNOW, YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT. I MEAN, YOU'RE PROBABLY THE BEST... EXCUSE ME? EXCUSE ME. YOU ARE THE BEST. I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT AFTER THIS CASE... I'M FINISHED. I MEANT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO... WITHOUT YOU? DO YOU WANT MY HONEST OPINION? I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE ALL THIS MONEY THAT YOU MADE AND MOVE TO EUROPE. MEET A GIRL. SEE THE WORLD. I MEAN, REALLY SEE THE WORLD. DON'T OBSERVE IT. SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I'M THE GREATEST PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR IN THE WORLD. UH, I'M GOING TO GO CHECK FOR SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES UNDER THE NAME KRAGAN VINCENT. I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF THAT'S NECESSARY. I THINK WHAT CLEARBURG MEANT WHEN HE SAYS THERE'S NO BOXER WITH THE NAME KRAGAN VINCENT IS THAT THERE'S NO BOXES WITH THE NAME KRAGAN VINCENT. I THINK IT'S A TYPO. RIGHT. RIGHT. PROBABLY USED A DIFFERENT NAME. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. WELL, THEN I THINK I'LL GO GET A BEER WITH MY FRIEND BILL. I SAID I THINK. I MEAN, YOU SHOULD GO AND CHECK. JUST TO MAKE SURE. OK. FINE. BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU'VE HEARD ME. SORRY TO STARTLE YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I FOLLOWED YOU. WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY CAR, THIS WAS ON THE WINDSHIELD. IT'S ANOTHER FUCKING PAYMENT DUE TOMORROW MORNING. JESUS. DID YOU MAKE SURE YOU WEREN'T FOLLOWED? I WASN'T. I TOLD YOU HOW TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE COME HERE. IS HE IN THERE? IF I WALKED IN THERE RIGHT NOW, WOULD MR. ZERO BE HAPPY TO MEET ME? HEY... GO HOME. RIGHT NOW. GO HOME, OK? MAKE THE PAYMENT TOMORROW. WE'RE VERY, VERY CLOSE. I'M SICK OF COOPERATING. YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE 2 OR 3 WEEKS. NOW IT'S EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS. WHY SO CLOSE TOGETHER? MAYBE THIS GUY'S GETTING NERVOUS. MAYBE HE WANTS TO KILL ME. I THINK I SHOULD CARRY A WEAPON. NO, YOU SHOULDN'T. LOOK, JUST DON'T PANIC. ALL RIGHT? SO HOW DEDICATED ARE YOU REALLY? YOUR TIMING IS IMPECCABLE. HOW DO YOU MEAN? NEVER MIND. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOME AMBITION OF YOUR OWN. MAYBE YOU WANT SOMEDAY TO, I DON'T KNOW, HAVE YOUR OWN FIRM. OH, YEAH, YOU'VE GOT ME PEGGED. THAT'S ALL I WANT IS TO SOME DAY BE DARYL ZERO. YEAH, WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU $1 MILLION IF YOU SELL OUT YOUR BOSS. JUST TURN OVER YOUR SUSPECT... NAME AND ADDRESS. $2 MILLION. FOR A NAME AND AN ADDRESS. CASH. WE CAN GO TO THE BANK RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE ME $2 MILLION SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS THING TOMORROW? I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU $5 MILLION. HOW MUCH DOES HE PAY YOU? $5 MILLION SO YOU CAN KILL SOMEONE RIGHT AWAY, INSTEAD OF A DAY LATER. NO, NO, FOR 5 MILLION, YOU DO IT. SO WHAT IF I WAS TO WALK IN THERE RIGHT NOW... HE'S NOT IN THERE, STARK. WHAT IF I WANT TO FIND OUT FOR MYSELF? WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? I'LL SHOOT YOU. REALLY, I WILL. I HAVE A GUN AND EVERYTHING. YOU'RE THREATENING ME? YEAH, I'M THREATENING TO KILL YOU. HEY. # DO YOU LOVE ME? # THINK OF ME NOW # WHILE YOU'RE CARVING OUT MY HEART OK. WHAT? RIGHT BEFORE YOU JUMP OFF THE PLANE. YOU STAND THERE, YOU GOT ALL THAT EQUIPMENT ON, AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. YOU CAN'T WAIT FOR THE RIDE. IS THERE A TIME WHEN YOU THINK, "WHAT IF IT DOESN'T OPEN? WHAT IF THIS IS THE LAST THING I EVER DO?" YOU'RE REALLY STUCK ON THIS SKYDIVING THING, AREN'T YOU? I'M STUCK ON WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES YOU DO VERY DANGEROUS THINGS. EVEN DANGEROUS THINGS CAN BE SAFE AS LONG AS YOU'RE CAREFUL. SUCH A THING AS KNOWING THE ODDS. QUITTING WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD. QUITTING BEFORE YOU'RE DEAD. YOU, ME, ANYONE COULD WALK OUT OF HERE AND GET KILLED BY SOME DRUNK IN A PICKUP. I COULD SLIP IN THE SHOWER AND BREAK MY NECK. WHEN YOUR NUMBER'S UP, IT'S UP. THERE'S NO SENSE TO IT. THERE'S NO JUSTICE. INNOCENT PEOPLE SUFFER AND MURDERERS GET AWAY WITH IT. SO WHEN MY NUMBER'S UP, WHETHER I'M WALKING DOWN THE STREET OR... DOING SOMETHING ELSE, THAT WILL BE THAT. AND UNTIL THEN, I'M JUST GOING TO DO WHAT I NEED TO DO. WHAT IS IT YOU NEED TO DO? I NEED TO... TRY TO FEEL RIGHT. Waitress: CAN I GET YOU FOLKS ANYTHING ELSE? NO, I THINK THAT'S IT. DO YOU NEED ANYTHING? NO, I'M OK. I'LL TAKE THE CHECK. YOU GOT IT. BE RIGHT BACK. WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, I USED TO HOPE THAT SOMEDAY I WOULD GROW UP TO LOOK LIKE THAT WAITRESS. WHAT? MY MOTHER HAD HAIR LIKE THAT. MY NATURAL MOTHER. REALLY. YEAH. YEAH. GOD, I FORGOT HOW THAT WORKS. WAIT A MINUTE. CAN A PERSON BE CONSIDERED PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? LIKE IN A RAPE CASE. HMM. MAYBE IF THE GUY DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE KID. YEAH. I THINK SO. YEAH, WE THINK SO. WHY? YOU MEAN... SHE IS THE EVIDENCE. SHE'S NOT KRAGAN'S DAUGHTER. SHE'S STARK'S DAUGHTER. I MUST ADMIT THAT I LIKE THIS PLACE. WHAT? YOU SAID THAT YOU DON'T SPEAK TO YOUR FAMILY. WHY NOT? I REALIZE I'M PRYING, BUT WHAT CAN I SAY? I'M PRYING. I WANNA KNOW ABOUT YOU. UM... JUST LOOK ME IN THE EYES AND TALK TO ME. ALL RIGHT. MY FATHER WAS AN EVIL, ABUSIVE MAN. HE KILLED MY MOTHER. AND WHEN SHE WAS SLEEPING. AND THEN HE SLIT HIS WRISTS. I WAS 13. NICK. I DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. MUCH. I USED TO WHEN IT HAPPENED. AND THEN ONE DAY I WOKE UP. I DON'T KNOW. EVERYTHING WAS DIFFERENT. HOW ABOUT THAT? WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU, DEFINES YOU. YEP. # I DON'T BELIEVE IN AN INTERVENTIONIST GOD # BUT I KNOW, DARLING, THAT YOU DO # BUT IF I DID, I WOULD KNEEL DOWN AND ASK HIM # NOT TO INTERVENE WHEN IT CAME TO YOU # OH, NOT TO TOUCH A HAIR ON YOUR HEAD # LEAVE YOU AS YOU ARE # IF HE FELT HE HAD TO DIRECT YOU # AND DIRECT YOU INTO MY ARMS SOMETIMES WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR NOSE. THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID. JUST GONNA STAND THERE WATCHING OR ARE YOU GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? # I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF ANGELS # LOOKIN' AT YOU, I WONDER IF THAT'S TRUE # BUT IF I DID, I WOULD SUMMON THEM TOGETHER # AND ASK THEM TO WATCH OVER YOU I GOTTA GET GOING. SO I'LL SEE YOU AROUND 6:00 AT MY PLACE. YEAH. AS SOON AS I'M DONE WITH MY MEETINGS. GOOD. BYE. Daryl: AT THIS POINT, YOU WILL RECEIVE A FINAL MESSAGE ON THE PAGER. GET ON THE CORRESPONDING BUS AND TAKE IT TO THE END OF THE LINE. FIND THE NEARBY BANK OF OUTHOUSES. IN CENTER UNIT, FIND PAIR OF BLUE PLASTIC GARBAGE BAGS. MAKE YOUR DEPOSIT AS USUAL. Daryl: WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS, GET BACK ON THE BUS. DO NOT HESITATE. DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THE DESIGNATED COURSE. YOU WILL BE MONITORED AT EVERY INTERVAL. WE ARE PREPARED TO ACT. THE WORDS WERE SIMILAR, BUT THERE WAS A NEW COMPONENT THIS TIME... DESPERATION. WHEN YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME AROUND THE CHEMISTRY OF DESPERATION, YOU COME TO RECOGNIZE THE SMELL. ONE DESPERATE ELEMENT IS COMBUSTIBLE. MORE THAN ONE DESPERATE ELEMENT IS LETHAL. SHIT. CALL 911. HURRY UP. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU OK? DO YOU KNOW YOUR NAME? WHO ARE YOU? THAT'S RIGHT, SIR, WHO ARE YOU? DO YOU KNOW? WHAT HAPPENED? CARDIAC ARREST. Paramedic: ARE YOU A DOCTOR? Man: WHAT'S THE NAME ON THAT BOX, SIR? THE NAME'S STARK. GLORIA STARK. ACCORDING TO OUR RECORDS, NOBODY'S BEEN TO THAT BOX FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. Daryl's Voice: SHE LOST THE KEY. HER FATHER HAD IT. HI. IT'S GLORIA. I'LL CALL YOU BACK. NICK? ARE YOU THERE? NICK. I'M HERE. I'M ABOUT TO GET ON A PLANE AND BE GONE FOREVER. I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. YEAH, I DON'T SEE ANY CHOICE. WHAT IF I COME FIND YOU? ARE YOU SO SURE THAT YOU COULD? THAI AIR, FLIGHT 214 DIRECT TO BANGKOK. DEPARTS IN HALF AN HOUR. OK. IT'S OVER. YOU FIGURED ME OUT. NOBODY ELSE GOT CLOSE. YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU? HE DOESN'T KNOW HE HAS A CHILD? I KNOW. SHE NEVER TOLD HIM. SHE WANTED HIM TO DENY THAT HE'D EVER EVEN TOUCHED HER, AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE, SURPRISE, LOOK WHO'S A DADDY. I HAD HIM. I HAD A RAPIST AND A MURDERER. HE HIRES KRAGAN VINCENT. KRAGAN DECIDES TO HIT HER IN HER MOTEL ROOM LATE AT NIGHT. HE GOES IN THE ROOM, SHOOTS HER TWICE, BUT WHAT HE DOESN'T REALIZE IS THAT YOU, LESS THAN A YEAR OLD, ARE IN THE ROOM. HE DOESN'T SEE YOU AT FIRST BECAUSE YOU'RE IN A CRAWLSPACE THAT SHE'S MADE FOR YOU BY PULLING THE CORNER OF THE BED CLOSER TO THE WALL. AND EVEN WITH THE SILENCER ON THE GUN AND EVERYTHING HAPPENING SO QUICKLY, YOU START CRYING. HE'S GOTTA DO SOMETHING. YOU'RE SCREAMING YOUR LUNGS OUT NOW, SO HE PICKS YOU UP... AND YOU STOP CRYING. AND ONCE HE'S GOT THE BABY, IT'S A DONE DEAL. THERE HE IS, HOLDING THE INFANT. THAT'S WHEN HE DECIDES. HE'D RATHER RISK IT ALL. HE'D RATHER RISK LIFE IN PRISON THAN LEAVE YOU IN THAT ROOM. IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOU FROM STARK, HE'S GOTTA GET RID OF ALL THE EVIDENCE... DIAPERS, DIAPER BAG... BOTTLES, BLANKETS, SOMETHING ON THE DRESSER, THE SINK, SOMETHING HANGING OFF A DOORKNOB. SOMETHING ON THE NIGHTSTAND. AND HE LEAVES HIS PRINTS EVERYWHERE. HE LEAVES THE BODY, TAKES THE BABY, AND HAULS ASS OUT OF THERE, 'CAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S GOTTA GET YOU TO HIS SISTER. YOU GROW UP THINKING VINCENT IS YOUR FATHER AND THAT YOU'RE BEING RAISED BY YOUR AUNT AND YOUR UNCLE. THEN... VINCENT COMES CLEAN. HE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED, BUT HE WOULD NEVER TELL ME WHO IT WAS. AND THEN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I FIGURED THAT OUT. MR. STARK. SO THEN YOU START WRITING LETTERS. STARK PAYS, AND THE REST IS HISTORY. YOU GOT THE WHOLE THING. YOU WIN. YEAH. YOU SAVED HIS LIFE THIS MORNING. I KNOW. I GUESS A PERSON CAN'T ESCAPE THEIR NATURE. HOW DID YOU KNOW... ABOUT ME? A COUPLE THINGS. THEN THE RECEIPT LAST NIGHT. I KNOW. I FORGOT TO TAKE IT. PASSION IS THE ENEMY OF PRECISION. WHAT? OH... I GOT SLOPPY. SO... ARE YOU GONNA COME LOOKING FOR ME? ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM ABOUT ME SO HE CAN HAVE SOMEBODY COME AND KILL ME? 'CAUSE HE WILL, YOU KNOW. I KNOW. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT THIS? THERE'S A MAN SITTING ON A BENCH BEHIND YOU. OH, GOD. IT'S OK. RELAX. HE HAS AN ENVELOPE. INSIDE ARE SOME FAKE IDENTIFICATION AND SOME PLANE TICKETS. FIRST ECUADOR AND THEN WHEREVER YOU WANT. KEEP MOVING THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS. STAY OUT OF WESTERNIZED COUNTRIES FOR A WHILE. DON'T CARRY TOO MUCH CASH ON YOUR BODY. GIVE INCORRECT INFORMATION EVERYWHERE. AND NEVER USE YOUR REAL NAME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SO IF YOU KNEW I WAS HERE, WHY DIDN'T YOU COME YOURSELF? I SURE, UH... I KNEW YOU'D BE THERE. I'D HOPED YOU'D BE HERE. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD JOIN ME. AH... A PERSON CAN'T ESCAPE THEIR NATURE. OH. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. YOU'RE THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN. SO ARE YOU. I'VE... I'VE NEVER SAID THE WORDS BEFORE... TO ANYONE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO. I LOVE YOU, TOO... DARYL ZERO. OH... SO ENDS MY ACCOUNT OF THE CASE THAT I HAVE NAMED, "THE CASE OF THE MAN "WHO GOT SO STRESSED OUT OVER HIS LOST KEYS "THAT HE EVENTUALLY HAD A HEART ATTACK AND IT TURNED OUT THEY WERE IN THE SOFA ALL ALONG." I RETURNED THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF MY FEE, AS I HAD NOT GIVEN A COMPLETE EXPLANATION. SOME QUESTIONS ARE FOR ANSWERING, OTHERS ARE BETTER LEFT TO TORTURE AND TORMENT FOR ALL ETERNITY. A NAGGING ITCH FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SEEMED REASONABLE. ESPECIALLY SINCE I DID SOLVE HIS PROBLEM. HE GOT THE TAPE THAT HE'D BEEN WAITING FOR FOR SO LONG. HE WOULDN'T BE THROWING ANY MORE MONEY DOWN THE TOILET. AND I GAVE BACK HIS KEYS. THIS DID IN FACT PROVE TO BE MY FINAL WORK EXPERIENCE WITH MY LONG-TIME ASSOCIATE. THOUGH I HAVE ASSURED HIM THAT WHEN HE SOMEDAY FINDS THAT HE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT ME, HIS POSITION WILL AGAIN BE AVAILABLE TO HIM. HE THANKED ME AND SUGGESTED THAT I NOT HOLD MY BREATH. I ALSO ATTENDED THE FUNERAL OF THE HITMAN WHO DIED NOT LONG AFTER THESE EVENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FOR SOME REASON I FELT A CERTAIN KINSHIP WITH THIS MAN, WHOSE LIFE WAS FOREVER CHANGED AFTER HE FAILED TO REMAIN OBJECTIVE ABOUT THE LADY BLACKMAILER. WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE OTHER PARTICIPANT. I NEVER MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO FIND HER. BUT IF MY SUSPICION IS CORRECT, THEN SHE'S FLYING THROUGH THE SKY EVEN AS WE SPEAK... PLUMMETING TOWARDS THE EARTH LIKE A FALLING BIRD, TO QUOTE ONE OF MY FAVORITE POETS. AFTER INVESTIGATING HER, I FOUND MYSELF IN BETTER SHAPE THAN EVER BEFORE IN MY LIFE. TO ME, SHE WILL ALWAYS BE A SINGULAR, UNFORGETTABLE EVENT. THE ONLY TIME I EVER TOOK LEAVE OF MY OBJECTIVITY. PERHAPS THE MOST ABLE BLACKMAILER OF HER TIME, SHE WAS AT ONCE THE WORTHIEST OPPONENT AND THE GREATEST ALLY... AND THE ONLY WOMAN I HAVE EVER... THE ONLY WOMAN, PERIOD. AND THOUGH I NEVER WOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED IT, IN THE END, SHE DID FOR ME WHAT I HAVE DONE FOR SO MANY. HELPED SOLVE A PROBLEM, FIRST BY OBSERVATION... THEN BY CAREFUL INTERVENTION. IN OTHER WORDS... THE ZERO EFFECT. # BECAUSE I LOVE YOU # I GET TONGUE-TIED AROUND YOU # I NEVER SAY SMART STUFF AROUND YOU # I NEVER SAY ANYTHING AROUND YOU # THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME # SO BECAUSE I LOVE YOU # I WILL NEVER BE WITH YOU # EVERYTHING I SAY IS TRUE # SO THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO # I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL I'LL SAY TO YOU # LET ME HAVE ONE DANCE WITH YOU # I RECOGNIZE THE LOOK # IN MY EYES WHEN I SEE YOU # IT'S THE LOOK OF ONE WHO LOVES YOU # WHO WANTS NOTHING EXCEPT TO BE WITH YOU # IT IS NOT THE LOOK # THAT OFTEN GETS RETURNED IN KIND # SAME OLD TALE, AIN'T NOTHIN' NEW # WHAT THE HELL'S A SOUL TO DO? # BUT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME THROUGH # BY GIVING ME ONE DANCE WITH YOU # ONE DANCE WITH YOU # ONE DANCE WITH YOU # ONE DANCE # WITH YOU # ONE DANCE WITH YOU # WHY DO ALL THE RULES I MAKE # ABOUT HOW TO ACT AROUND OTHER PEOPLE # LIKE DON'T WRITE THEM PRIVATE NOTES # TRYIN' TO EXPLAIN YOUR FOOLISH ACTIONS # LIKE NOT HANGING AROUND # FOR HOURS AFTER IT'S OBVIOUS # THAT YOUR PRESENCE AIN'T DESIRED # LIKE NAMES ARE NOT IMPORTANT # SO IF SOMEONE FORGETS YOUR NAME # THEY'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING INTANGIBLE # THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU # SO IT'S STUPID TO FEEL BAD # IF SOMEONE FORGETS YOUR NAME # WHY DO ALL THE RULES THAT I MAKE # ABOUT HOW TO ACT AROUND OTHER PEOPLE # ALWAYS FALL BY THE WAYSIDE # WHEN I GET AROUND YOU? # THERE AIN'T NO MORE CARROTS TO # THAT OLD SKY AIN'T NEVER BLUE # THAT'S A LIE, BUT THIS IS TRUE # ALL I WANT'S ONE DANCE WITH YOU # MY BETS ARE MADE, MY STUFF'S ASKEW # I AIN'T HEARD THE DUMBEST CLUE # I JUST WANT TO SQUEEZE ON THROUGH # AND GET IN ONE MORE DANCE WITH YOU # STICK IT WHILE THERE'S STILL SOME GLUE # MOVE OUT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S TRUE # BEFORE I STUMBLE SOMEPLACE NEW # LET ME HAVE ONE DANCE WITH YOU # LET ME HAVE ONE DANCE WITH YOU # IF I... # COME A-KNOCKIN'... # KNOCKIN' AT YOUR DOOR # WOULD YOU LET ME IN # LIKE YOU'VE DONE BEFORE? # IF I ASK THE QUESTION # ON THIS OCTOBER DAY # WOULD YOU SAY # IT'D BE A JOY WITH YOU, MY GOOD BOY # 'CAUSE IF YOU WILL, I'D SAY... # LET'S RUN OFF # AND GET MARRIED # THAT'S THE ONLY THING FOR US TO DO # LET'S RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED # IF YOU LOVE ME # LIKE I LOVE YOU
