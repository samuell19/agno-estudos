Mr. Douglas, has all this alfalfa grown from those seeds I sold you at that low discount price? Look at how they've rooted. I'm the happiest man in town. Well, I've always prided myself as being the farmer's best friend. That's why I'd hate to see you lose this crop. -How could I lose it? -Malnutrition. Malnutrition. Now don't you worry about that, Mr. Haney. I'm giving these plants the best care money can buy. You are as dedicated as they come, Mr. Douglas. That's why I know you'd like to get my special organic growth stimulator. It's just come on the market. What's so special? I import it from East Germany. Now that the wall's down, I'm doing business over there. It's called Gorby-Grow. Gorby-Grow? I'll put you down for 100 bags. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take one bag just to experiment with. Why don't we round it off at an even number? Say 23 bags. An even number would be 20 bags. Sold. [hammering] Alf, what do you think? Looks good to me. I don't understand, Ralph. Why are the Douglases putting their bathtub outside? It's a hot tub, Alf. A bunch of people get in there... naked. A bunch of people? Grown-ups? Naked? Well, what if someone sees you? Then they get in there, too. Party time. Boy, I always thought two lines at the kissing booth -was about as far as you could go. -[both chuckle] [Oliver] Lisa! Lisa! What the... Hi, Mr. Douglas. It's a hot tub. The way it works is a bunch of naked people get in-- I know it's a hot tub. What's it doing out in front? That's what the plans called for, Mr. Douglas. Look. [sighs] Oh. Okay, Alf, let's slide this sucker around to the back of the house. Good morning, Mr. Kimball. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Well, not beautiful. Uh, more like fair. Well, not really fair. Well, it isn't unfair, either. Something in between fair and beautiful, sort of fairful. Mr. Kimball, aren't you here to inspect my tub? Tub? Oh, yeah. If you have a permit. Do you think that Rome was built without permits? Do you think the Tower of London went up without a permit? Do you think that Yankee Stadium-- Mr. Kimball. Permit me. Oh. Well, why didn't you say so? Well, let's get down to business. What's a tub doing out here? [Alf] It works this way, Mr. Kimball. A couple of naked people get in... Well, okay, Mr. Douglas, if that's the way you city folks want to live. But I'll tell you right now, the rest of the bathroom stays in the house. Of course, it will, yes. Well... Then let's turn it on, see if it works. Holy smoke! Look at this mud. For the life of me, Ralph, I don't know how you two stay in business. Same as you, Mr. Douglas, through hard work and perseverance. Lisa? Lisa. -[Lisa] Be right there, darling. -[cow mooing] Oh, hey! Guess what! My alfalfa's in full bloom. Bottom 40's a sea of green as far as the eyes can see. Alfalfa! That's wonderful news. But what are we going to do with all that falafala? Oh. Alfalfa. It's fodder for the animals. Oh, darling, I'm so proud of you. And maybe next year you can grow the mudder. Uh, no. Fodder is what animals eat. You mean to say they eat their own fodder? That's terrible. That's like capitalism. No, you mean cannibalism. You've seen them? No, I didn't... No, I didn't... You mean to say they do it in secret? That's terrible! Oh, for... Well, I'm going to have to discuss it with the animals tonight. But right now I'm on my way to my very first art show. Come on, Oliver, show me. Which one do you like the best? Well, uh, that's, uh, hard to decide. They're all so unique. Oh. Say, I like that one of Paris. But they're all of New York. -Even Eleanor and Drabny know that they are all of New York. -[honking] [Lisa] You see? Look, here's the Umpire State Building. Yeah, the Empire State Building! I've never seen New York pictured exactly this way. Oh, Oliver, you have such a good eye. Yes, yes. And such a cute nose. Yeah, mmm-hmm. [Armstrong] Do you see those fields of gold and green? Those charming little farmhouses? Well, we're going to wipe them right off the map. These lands weren't meant to produce bushels of grain. They were meant to produce bushels of money, mini-malls, tract homes. -Fast-food restaurants? -Yeah, a city of the future. Life in the fast lane. -Good luck, Lisa. -Oh, thank you. I hope you don't bring a single one of these home. Goodbye, darling. Afternoon, Mr. Douglas. Oh, Daisy. More vegetables? I brought more vegetables for you. We haven't finished that radish you brought us last month. Well, I brought you some carrots to go with it. I dug 'em up early so they wouldn't get too big. Daisy, your vegetables are extraordinary. How do you do it? I'm a Ziffel. Farming's in my blood. Your aunt, Doris and uncle, Fred would be very proud of you. Well, they left me the farm. It's up to me to make it work. Daisy, have you ever thought of... Spending less time in the field and more time playing the field? [laughs] In Hooterville? Yeah. -Oh, it can't be done. -Why? All the men here are either too old, too young, or too married. Can't be as bad as all that. Oh, no? I was so starved for companionship last night, I took Arnold to the Hooterville High basketball game. Arnold likes basketball? Arnold! ["Sweet Georgia Brown" playing] [Oliver] Hey! -He loves it. -[snorting] Kept me up all night practicing his slam dunk. [laughs] [oinking] [Lisa] Where is everybody? [clock chimes] Oh. [bell on door chimes] Excuse me, Mr. Drucker. Did anybody call about my art show? Lamar Beebe called a little while ago. He wants to know when it's over so he can schedule a checker game over there. -Oh. -[bell on door chimes] Excuse me, sir. Can you give me directions to-- Franklin, look. They're the most beautiful things I've ever seen. You see, Mr. Drucker? And I didn't even have to cut off my ear. Excuse me. Which ones do you like the best? Why, these. Here behind those awful paintings. [exclaims] Aren't they simply gorgeous? Franklin, I'm going to browse. I, I can paint a hurricane lamp. It's very easy. It's just a wick in a vase. Well, I guess that's about it for the art show, huh, Mrs. Douglas? Yes, I guess it is. [rooster crows] [knock on door] [knocking continues] -Mr. Douglas? -Yeah. Okay, come on, kids, here we go, here we go. Come on, Flo. All right, Jeb. Let's go see Grandpa. Come on, here we go. Okay, here we go. Let's go see Gramps. Here we go. -Come on, sweetheart. -Okay, come on, boy. Come on. Oh, hey, Dad. You mind if I leave the family here for a while? I gotta get into town real fast. I'm always glad to spend some time with your family. Oh, Flo, looks like this one is about ready to sit down at the table and have supper. These two. I'm having twins. Oh? Oh-ho! And you know what that means, Dad. You owe me two acres of land, one acre per child, just like you promised when we got married. You certainly made the most of that arrangement, didn't you, Eb? We're just following what you always told me, "Be productive." Okay, kids, now look, don't cause your grandpa any trouble while we're gone. Dad, why do we have to call Mr. Douglas "grandpa"? He's not even your father. Jeb here's becoming a regular teenage rebel. Wasn't I just like that when I was his age? What? When I met you, you were 24. And adopted me right on the spot. No. I hired you for my handyman. You adopted me. See, Dad? Mr. Douglas, do you mind if I call you Mr. Douglas? I wish somebody in this family would. Boy, oh, boy, kids today are really something. They either want to drop out of school and get their ears pierced, or they hang around complaining about how boring it is in Hooterville. Where is it all heading? I believe you were heading into town. Oh, gosh, that's right. I gotta get into Drucker's real fast and pick up a drum of calamine lotion. The little ones got into some poison ivy down in the lower 40, and they've been scratching worse than a hound dog at a flea circus. Poison ivy in the lower 40? The whole 40 acres! That's impossible. I, I planted alfalfa! Golly, ain't that something? Poison ivy growing out of that alfalfa seed Mr. Haney sold you. You ought to call Farmers' Almanac. Oh, I'll sue him, I'll sue him. Remember, this project is your baby, your big chance to show me what you've got. Now sit up straight. Don't worry about me, Dad. I'll deliver. As long as we can figure out a way to force these people to sell their land. Force? We don't have to force 'em. Someone will do that for us. Do you have a connection on the real estate board? No, someone better. The man who put the "win" in "swindle." Sounds like you made a deal with the devil, Dad. [laughs] Close. Our rooms do have the lake view, don't they? That's what we requested. They certainly do, ma'am. These are only $10 a day. Do you want to pay as you go or put 'em on your bill? Okay, okay, put 'em on the bill, but there better be an indoor skating rink like it said in the brochure. Yes, it's right up that way. -Come on children. -Up the stairs there. Come on children. [applauding] Ah, Mr. Haney, it's always a pleasure to see a master at work. Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. It's nice to know the entrepreneurial spirit is still appreciated. -This is my son Brad. -Howdy. He's the junior partner in the Armstrong Development Company. He'll be running the show here in Hooterville. Shake hands, Brad. His hand. Step into the Astoria Room here, just sit down. You know, Mr. Haney, I've heard so much about you. Is it true that you sold a Toyota to Lee Iacocca? Oh, them was just small, uncooked potatoes, son. Today we're discussing real money. You said you had a plan. A master plan. I'm going after the most influential man in Hooterville, Oliver Wendell Douglas. And when I sell him, everybody else in town will be throwing their deeds at my feet. And you'll have the 20-story high-rise we agreed on. The Taj Mahaney. You've cut quite a deal for yourself, Mr. Haney. All I want to do is just leave the world a better place. Are you sure you can get this Douglas to sell? I'm positive. As much as it pains me, I have drawn up a proposal offering Oliver Douglas five times the original cost of his farm. He'll jump at it. Oliver, what's the matter with you, darling? Oh, Lisa. After all these years of farming this land, after putting up with every kind of human indignity, I have been rewarded today with a crop of poison ivy. You mean that your green bottom isn't falafala? The only thing that field is gonna produce is a rash. I'm boiling mad. And I'm boiling sad. You know that not one person came to see my art show? I'm going to find a corner and paint myself into it. Yeah. Remember when things like this wouldn't bother us? No matter what happened, our spirits remained high. I don't remember that. Was I happy then? Did I laugh? Lisa, we've lost our spark. Oh, I feel it, too. Oliver, what are we going to do? Well, maybe it's time to leave. Maybe it's time to go back to New York. Oh, that reminds me, you got a letter from New York. It's marked "urgent, confidential, personal, for your eyes only." I wonder who it was from. Oh, it's from your law firm. They want you to go back and try a case. Yeah! I'm the only one that can handle the case. Of course, you are the only one. But don't they want you to win it, too? Well, I have to admit, I'd love to help the firm out. And maybe it is finally time I got back to something I know. I'll bet that would rekindle my spark. And mine, too. Walking down 5th Avenue, look at all those lovely people. Oliver, are you sure you're ready to go back? Well, I'll tell you this. If one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to hang up my pitchfork. I'll make you some tea. Oliver, when you said one more thing goes wrong, did you mean a little thing or a mediocre thing, or a big thing? We'll know when it happen... Oliver! -Oh, for-- -Oliver! Why are you in the root cellar? [coughs] I've had it! We're leaving! We're going back to New York! Mr. Haney. Mr. Douglas, are you all right? I'm okay. I want to talk to you. Ain't that a coincidence, Mr. Douglas? I want to talk to you, too. It'll have to wait. I came to tell you that-- Now, I insist. Now, this might be a surprise-- No surprises. I came to tell you that Mrs. Douglas and I have come to a... An important decision. Well, so have I. I've decided to offer you-- Oh, no, you don't! Every time you offer me something, it costs me twice as much. -I'm gonna offer you five times-- -I want to sell Green Acres. Well, you can't... Uh, Green Acres. Well, now, I suppose I could make you an offer of, say, 50% of your original cost. One hundred percent. Shall we split the difference, say 70%? Split the difference isn't... Now look, I'm not gonna fall for that again. One hundred percent of my original cost. Well, I must say, Mr. Douglas, you've learned quite a bit through the years, haven't you? You can bet I have, and I want this money right away. Well, now, that's another wrinkle in the quilt. To get that much money together would take me six or seven months. Oh, I can't wait that long. Suppose I give you what I've got on hand now. How much is that? Uh, 40% of your original cost. Fifty! Sold! Ha, ha! Mr. Douglas, it's good doing business with you. -No haggling. -[coughs] [sneezes] You better not set your equipment up in that field. Is this your field? Nope. Why don't you just mind your own business, all right? Okeydokey. But you'd be better off on this side of the fence. Huh? [grunts] [panting] [grunts] He can open that gate when he's mad. Oh, no. Oh, no! Yep. Good bull. Nice bull. You don't wanna do this! No place to hide back there. Whoa! Oh, no! Oh, God! Here we go. Whoa! Come on! [yelling] Yee-ha! Hello! Whoa! Boy, this is sure fun. Thanks a lot. Lester, Jeb, what's up? So what'd you do last night? Nothing, man. What'd you do? Ooh, I went to L.A. in my private jet, sang with Guns n' Roses, and I stopped by Joan Jett's place, taught her a couple of dance moves. You know, same old thing. Stayed home, too, huh? What else is there to do? I helped my mom clean out the refrigerator. Let's face it, we're trapped, stuck in Hooterville, town of the living dead. Boy, I wish I could get out of this place. Hooterville has got to be the most boring town on the planet. As soon as I get a chance, I am leaving here, and I am never, ever looking back. Yes, yes, we have extensive scuba-diving facilities. Reef? Absolutely. The Great Hooterville Reef is right outside our back door. Two weeks? I'll squeeze you in. Yeah. [laughs] Get me the SPCA. I want to report a dangerous animal terrorizing innocent citizens. It appears like that old Thunderhooves has been chasing you. From one end of town to the other. You should've bought that bull insurance I suggested. 'Course, now the premium will be higher because the bull's already seen you. I can't wait till this town is one big parking lot. Have the Douglases left yet? No, they'll be leaving tomorrow. Tonight the town is holding a big farewell shindig. And don't you worry, I have pulled a few strings and you are invited. That'll be $2 for the ticket. I'm not going to any farewell parties. Well, I guarantee that this is one experience you wouldn't want to miss. Have you ever seen a selling panic up close? Oh, it's the most beautiful sight in the world. Oh. Well, that does sound like something I'd like to see. But I can't go like this. Well, if you're looking for a new suit, you might try the men's store in the hotel arcade. Arcade? Step this way. Something in an Italian cut? [country music playing] [people chattering] Eb? Eb, I think it's time. Is this it, honey? [moans] Uh-uh. Phew. What'd you write, Sam? "Roses are red, acres are green, you're the worst farmer this town's ever seen." [laughing] -What's so funny? -Nothing, nothing. Well, keep on having fun. Hi, Arnold. Who's your girlfriend? I feel completely out of place. Relax. Enjoy yourself, son. You are seeing a dream come true, mine. -Come on. -[sneezes] Hello there! Cake is served. It's Mrs. Douglas' famous pineapple upside-down cake. Come on, now. Who is first? Come on. You don't have to be shy. I made a lot of them. I have three more. Come on, now, everybody. Don't be bashful. Mr. Haney, who's that, that girl? Daisy, why don't you take the first piece and break the icing? Daisy. Young Mr. Armstrong. Here I thought you was all business. Oh, I'm so glad. You finally took your head out of the vegetable patch. Those are the most beautiful eyes I ever seen on a two-legger. Come on, introduce me. Well, come on, let's meet him. Come on. May I present my second cousin once removed on my sister Bertha's side, Brad Armstrong. Brad is a kindergarten teacher, interested in learning rural educational techniques. And this is Daisy Ziffel, one of the loveliest, most charming, beautiful girls in Hootersville. And she's also very popular. It's nice to meet you. [Lisa laughs] Well, you two seem to have a lot to talk about. Oh, come on, Mr. Haney. I want you to taste my chocolate chip clam dip. Mrs. Douglas, you never cease to amaze me with your culinary technique. Oh, come on, Mr. Haney. You're just kissing the baloney stone. Come on. It's a nice party, isn't it? Sure is. -Uh, you live around here? -Sure do. You try that new fertilizer? It's four times as coarse as the old kind. Well, I'll be sure to pick some up... Uh, I mean, buy some. Be sure and get the extra-aged 'cause the other kind will burn the roots right off your okra. Sounds like you really know your fertilizer. Sure do. Stick my nose in a pile and tell you the name of the horse. [laughs] -Nice music, isn't it? -Sure is. When a man like Oliver Douglas vacates an area, he's got a very good reason. He's just tired of farming. You didn't buy that, did you? I tell you, gentlemen, something is afoot in Hooterville and he's onto it. Yeah, he's onto it. Onto what? Well, it'll surface real soon, but I tell you, rumors are flying. What kind of rumors? The worst kind. Disaster is close at hand. Can't you just feel it? I can. Oh, boy. Could I have your attention here, folks? Just for a minute, if you please. Uh, I'd like to make a little toast here. Yes, thank you. Uh, we came to Hooterville full of hopes and dreams, and we hoped to become successful farmers. -[laughter] -Except the crops didn't grow. [laughter] But our love for this place and the people, that grew. Now, I have been asked to come back to New York to help my old law firm-- Law firm? We always thought you were disbarred. [laughter] Yeah, we thought you came here in disgrace. Well, we knew you came here on a train, but... Please, what I'm trying to say is how much, how much we love the place, the people, and how sad I am, uh... Come on, Mr. Douglas, fess up! Confession is good for the soul. Did you do time? [laughter] Okay, I give up. Lisa! Thank you. Well, I am usually not the one who gives a toast, but this time I really have to. Even though my English isn't perfect, you never made fun of me, and I want to thank you for that, and for so many other things. I am going to miss you from the bottom of my heart. And the top, too. To the Douglases. You came here as strangers, but you're leaving as family. Best family a boy ever had. Well, to the, uh... -The Douglases. -Oh, the Douglases! [all] Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! To Hootersville! Are you sure we're doing the right thing? Oh, Oliver. Oliver, it was your idea, and you always know best. And from now on, we are just going to look ahead and never look back. Yeah, but this has been our home for so long. Giving it up is-- Is very difficult. I know. Oliver, we're going to take this to New York to remember Green Acres by. -Oh, good. -[both chuckle] [Oliver] Those people look like ants. -Are you happy, darling? -Oh, yes, yes, yes. So am I. You know, New York is even more beautiful than I remembered it. -Oh, better. I have an idea. -Yes? Why don't we eat breakfast out here on the terrace like we used to? Oh, lovely idea. I'll go make the hot cakes. -I'll set the table. -Good. -New York is full of surprises. -Oh! Mr. Haney, how did you do? I got the deed to Drucker's, the cafe, and the filling station. And... It was a clean sweep. Young Mr. Armstrong, Hooterville is ours. We have the feed store. We have, uh, the car wash and Ziffel's farm. Mr. Haney, that's all the land we need. How did you do it? Told everybody a different story. [chuckles] There's a hole in the ozone layer right over their farm. There's a toxic waste dump moving next door. And my all-time favorite, a certified geologist's report proving that the Hooterville earthquake fault goes right under Daisy Ziffel's farm and right down Main Street. Well, hold on. What if these people talk to each other? I pledged them all to secrecy. That's the first rule of divide and conquer. Mr. Haney, congratulations. Now, about my bonus. There was no bonus in our agreement. Uh, well, it wasn't written in, but it's generally understood. Well, understand this. I'm gonna be mailing these deeds off to my dad today, and we're gonna be tearing this town down before you know it. Well, I... [whistling] There you go, Mrs. Asher. Can I help you? Yeah, the, uh, sign outside said that this was a post office. That's right. Zip code number 40516½. Next. [clears throat] I'd like to send this to New York. Express mail. Express mail? What's that? Overnight. Gets there the next day. Get out! Vera, will you quit thumping on that gumball machine? What she won't do to get a licorice. Can you tell me what's in this? I have to fill out some insurance forms. Sure, they're just reports. Cards. Uh, r-report cards. So, like, I'm a bird, and I'm flying higher and higher and higher, and below me is Hooterville. It's getting smaller and smaller and smaller until it disappears. And then, I wake up. I can interpret that dream. It's death. No, no. It's all about me leaving Hooterville. And the best part is it's not a dream. You know what I'm going to miss the most? The Hooterville Cafe. Best french fries in the world. Don't worry, man. The cafe will still be here. Hooterville hasn't changed for a thousand years. Hello, Mrs. Douglas. Good to see you again. We've certainly missed you. Your party's right over here. [excitedly] Oh, Lisa! I can't believe it. Oh, Lisa! I haven't seen you in ages. [overlapping chatter] Well, you know, I am so glad that I finally got here. I almost didn't get anywhere. Well, the taxi driver got lost. He's only been in America for two days. [laughing] And then, and then the bus broke down and the driver started to cry and ran away. And then, to top it all, when I was walking on the street this man opened his coat, and guess what he showed me. [laughing] Dirty Ernie. So, now tell us, Lisa, what brought you back to the jungle? Well, we came back to New York to find our spark plugs, our joy of living. Senorita,your steak tartare. No, I'm sorry, I didn't order that. Thank you. Do you both remember that lovely French restaurant Oliver and I used to love? Well, I am going to take him there for a welcome-home surprise. He'll be surprised, all right. Trump bought that place years ago. It's now the waterfall in the bottom of his tower. Here's your lump crab meat, senora. I'm sorry, I didn't order this, either. Actually, the steak tartare looked much better. Well, make up your mind. Dios mio! I don't know why, but he seems upset. Oh, which reminds me, we bought you a welcome-home present. It's a New York survival kit. Thank you. Thank you. Ooh, what a pretty box. What is this for? To get a cab. Oh. There are so many goodies in here. And... And this? For when you can't get a cab. [laughs] Air freshener? Oh! No, it's mace! Don't leave home without it. Here's your cold cream vichyssoise. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't order that, either. Well, what did you order, senora? Nothing. We are still waiting for the menu. Troublemakers! Dios mio! The waiters here are fabulous, aren't they? So much character. [scoffs] So, Lisa, I'll bet that coming back to civilization has been an inspiration for your paintings. Oh, yes. New York is so colorful, so inspiring. In fact, that is the title of my latest painting. Oh. Oh! My portfolio is gone. Well, at least someone likes my painting. Cheers, girls. Cheers, darling. [man] Where is he, Wilfred? We've got another meeting in 12 minutes. [Wilfred] Don't worry about Oliver Douglas. He'll be here. Hey, good morning! Sorry I'm late. Big traffic tie-up on the 81st floor. Hello, Caldwell, Fred, Kyle, Wilfred. How are you? So... Well, tell me about the case that's giving you all that trouble. -Renford vs. Thaw. -Yeah. It's a class-action suit against one of the largest real estate conglomerates in the city. The tenants claim that the landlord withheld heat from December through February. Withheld the heat? All through the New York winter? Oh, we'll get that landlord, won't we? Douglas, we're representing the landlord. Why? He's a citizen of our country, he's innocent until proven guilty, and he pays us an unbelievable retainer. Well, that may be enough for some people, but not for me. No, I... I can't have any part of that. Perhaps, sir, if you knew a bit more about the fine points of the case. You'll be appearing before Judge Ellison. Ellison. Roy Ellison? Stinky Ellison and I were roommates in law school. Really? What a coincidence. I guess then you'll be spending a lot of time with Judge Stinky, uh, Ellison. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Caldwell. I... I don't practice law that way. Douglas, in this office, we work as a team. Love what you've done with the office, Douglas. One suggestion, lose the pitchfork. [door shuts] I didn't realize that things had changed that much. It's a whole new ball game, Oliver. But when I take on a case, I-- No, no, you don't take on a case anymore. A case is assigned to you by computer. -By computer? -Yeah. Yes, according to your strengths. Well, I won't have that. Oh, you'll come around to it, Ollie. I did. By the way, Wilfred, how are you doing with that suit against Mother Teresa? Uh, fine, Caldwell. Fine. Nail her, Wilfred! This mud is everywhere. I don't know how you people live here. Two minutes thirty. [Daisy] Hey, Arnold, don't go too far. Hi, Brad. Oh, Daisy. Hi. You know, I was just thinking about you. Ah, sure you were. Well, you know, if you're gonna be a while, -I'll just, I'll come back. -No, no, don't. I'll be done in two minutes and, uh... One minute forty-five. See. You want to help me do the inside? No. But I'm a good watcher. Daisy, I, I was wondering, are there any movie theaters around here? There are twin cinemas in Pixley. One of 'em doesn't work. [both chuckle] Well, do you think you'd maybe want to... go out with me one night? I like movies. Great. Well, maybe we can have dinner first. I like dinner. Really? I knew we'd have something in common. [laughing] Time's up! Well, I'd better get going. Arnold hates it when I keep him waiting for his bath. -Arnold. -[oinking] Daisy, listen. There's something I have to tell you. I'm not who you think I am. You're married. I knew it. I have the worst luck this side of the Mississippi. No, that's not it. You do like girls, don't you? Oh, yeah! Yes, very much. Sometimes too much. I'm a land developer and we're developing Hooterville. Mr. Haney told me that my farm was-- No, no. Mr. Haney was just acting as our agent. Daisy, Hooterville's gonna have a whole new look. It's gonna have high-rises and highways and half a million people. You mean you're gonna level everything just to put up a bunch of concrete buildings? No, no, that's not it. It's gonna be a major industrial site. And I'm heading up the whole thing. And I was just hoping it wouldn't make a difference, we could still get to know each other. Not on your life. I know as much about you as I ever need to know. [oinking] Arnold, he's not worth it. [Oliver] Lisa, do I have to do this? Come on. Attack on me. What if I hurt you? Oh, you won't. All my friends told me I have to learn a martial art. All right. Oliver, I'm a lethal weapon. Okay! Stick 'em up, lady! Give me those diamonds. -Hai! -Oh! Oliver, it's working. [panting] [doorbell rings] Oliver, you just stay right there. Next time, I think I can flip you higher. [doorbell rings] -Are you Lisa Douglas? -Yes. Here. I couldn't get a nickel for 'em. -Oh... -There's no complexity. They're too mundane. -Oh! -Where's the passion? Oh! "Where is the passion?" Ooh! Oh, Oliver, everybody's a critic in New York, even the thieves. Well, it just proves that there's still some honest people in New York. Tell me, Oliver, are you really happy in New York? Well, I'm happy if you're happy. Well, that's good. Because if you are happy, I am happy. Well, good night, my darling. Mmm. Good night. [gunshot, woman screams] [man] Hey, you punk, get out of here! [man 2] Shut up, you old man, I'll punch you! -[men yelling] -[alarm ringing] [sirens wailing] [Daisy] You lied to us, Mr. Haney. We don't want to leave Hooterville. We would have never sold if you hadn't scared us off with those crazy stories. [angry mutterings] Quiet, quiet. I assure you, my dear friends, I was duped. Them city slickers took advantage of me, too, and when I found out, my eyes puddled up and I cried like a baby. Well, then we'll just tell 'em the deal's off, we changed our minds. Oh, unfortunately, the deeds was transferred this morning. You all have till the end of the month to get out. We're not gonna stand for this. We're gonna get ourselves a lawyer. Oh, a lawyer would be too expensive. It'd cost you every dime you got. Let's get a cheap lawyer. No, a cheap lawyer wouldn't be smart enough to beat Armstrong. So what we need is a smart lawyer who works cheap. Oliver Wendell Douglas! Dad! New York City, here we come! Gosh, where do you think all these people are going? I don't know, but the way they're moving, they must be late. Golly! I never thought you could get dizzy just standing on the ground. Imagine painting one of those suckers. You wouldn't need another job for the rest of your life. We ain't turning down no work. Will you guys stop acting like tourists? -We have to find Mr. and Mrs. Douglas. -[man] Yo. Yo. Youse folks look smart. Would you like to buy a watch? Check it out. No, all we need right now is directions to 255 Park Avenue. -Can you help us? -You don't wanna buy a watch? No, no, no watch. Just directions. Go back into Grand Central Station. Take the shuttle. Get off at the next stop, 7th Avenue. Take the 7th Avenue line and you'll be where you wanna go. Feels like we've been down there for hours. It has been hours. Look at that! [Eb] Golly! -Snap my peas! -[Arnold snorting] [Drucker] And roll my oats. That's as pretty as a pink sow going uphill in a red wagon. Wow! How'd a city ever get so big? [Ralph] How do they keep it from sinking into the lake? How'd we get over here? How do we get back over there? I knew we shouldn't have listened to that guy with all the watches. I guess I better go ask somebody else. [Daisy] Excuse me, sir. I know I'm disturbing you. I know I'm a hick and you have better things to do with your time-- Whoa. Whoa, Sounds like you're having a hard time getting directions. Where do you wanna go? Two fifty-five Park Avenue. You get on the "D" here and you go two stops to Sheridan Square. Get off and walk to the end of the platform. Take the BMT local and change at 59th for the double "R." You get in the last car and you go four stops. When you get out, you're gonna see an up stairway marked "Queens." Don't take it. Take the down stairway and follow the signs to the west side. Take the IRT to 42nd, jump on the shuttle, take the eastside express to 72nd, change for the local, pop up to 79th, walk two blocks north, and you're there. We're walking. Wait a minute. Where's Arnold? He's over there. [Daisy] Come on, Arnold, stop wandering off. Hey, mister! Thanks! [oinking] How may we be of service? I'm Dorian Pinser. How do you do, Mr. Doberman Pinscher. I'm Lisa Douglas. Uh, may I show you my paintings? They're all for sale. Look, I only have a few. I just had a chance to make them this morning. Only a dozen. Is this some kind of cruel joke? You like them? I loathe them. -Oh, you poor man. -All right, out, out. Please, out. [Ralph] Grown-ups sure must like to read in this town. Everywhere you turn there's a bookstore for adults. [Drucker] Look at the size of those letters. I can read everything without my bifocals. [Daisy] Well, let's move on. [Alf] Look at all this garbage! I guess tomorrow's pick up day. Boy, you must feel right at home, Arnold. [Drucker] My feet hurt, and all this walking ain't helping my varicose veins. [Alf] Quit complaining, Sam. The Douglas house must be just up ahead. [Eb] Gosh, it's starting to rain. I honestly don't understand how you two did it, all those years in the country. What did you talk about, crop prices? Oh, we never had any crops. One afternoon Eb and I talked the whole afternoon about whether a hawk makes lazy circles in the sky -or lazy ovals in the sky. -[Lisa chuckles] Well, I guess that's out of my system. Oh, I'm glad. [Wilfred] All that "shucks" and "gee whillikers," it would have driven me right to the vodka. What those people do to the language! Yeah, they're not like us New Yorkers here. "What you lookin' at, man?" "End of the line, man." What about this, Oliver? "It's on toity-toit and toit." [Oliver chuckles] That's pretty good. Taxi! Daisy, Daisy, we've been walkin' for another ten blocks, and the last five of 'em in the rain. My feet hurt. -There it is! Right down there. -Golly! [Ralph] Do they live here all by themselves? We'll ask him. May I help you folks? We won't ask him. Evening. We're here to see Oliver and Lisa Douglas. I'm afraid they're not in. Would you care to leave a message? No, thanks. We'll wait upstairs. No one goes into that building unless I first receive specific instructions. I'll give you specific instructions, sonny. Out of my way. I'm going in there to that couch. You take one step into that lobby, grandpapa, and I promise you you'll be seeing stars. Yeah. Go ahead, Sam. We're right behind you. [horn honks] None of you move. It's them! It's them! Oh, Lisa, look who's here! Well, you're a fresh of breath air! [excited chatter] [oinking] How do you do, Mr. Douglas? [overlapping chatter] Douglas, who are these people? Why, this is Daisy and this is Eb and this is Alf and Ralph and Mr. Drucker and Mr. Kimball! These are our friends from Hooterville! And who is that, the mayor? Why, that's our Arnold. Come on, darling. Come on, baby. Did you hear her, Wilfred? She was talking to a pig. Come on, come on, I want you to meet these people. Uh, Mr. Douglas, you got chairs up in that penthouse? -Yes, we've got chairs. -Well, then let's go! [Wilfred] We're gonna head home, Ollie. We should be running along. Oh, I have to tell Ruthie. She always said Lisa's bread wasn't fully baked. [Oliver] Some other time? Good night. Come on in. Come on in, everybody. How do you like it? Wow! I like that sofa. Well, sit down, then, Mr. Drucker. [sighs] Oh, it's so nice to have you here. Let me get this straight. You say that Haney has bought up all of Hooterville? Every last inch of land. He lied to us. I don't know how that man has the nerve to go to church. -He owns the church. -And charges two bucks admission. Oh. Mr. Douglas, we need a lawyer to get our homes back. Oh, don't you worry about that, Daisy. If there is a peepshole in the contract, Mr. Douglas is going to find it. Wait a minute. I don't, uh... My firm really doesn't... Will you help us? Oliver, does that mean a yes? Yes. Yes, that means a yes. The heck with the firm. We're gonna find Mr. Mitchell Armstrong and we're gonna put a stop to this thing right now. Good, good. [woman screams] Get away! Get away! [screams] Oh, get away! Get away! He's not going to bite you. He's just trying to tell you how pretty you are. Miss Bader... would you please get off that chair? Yes, sir. I'm sorry. What's going on here? I mean, who are you people? Mr. Armstrong, my name is Oliver Douglas. -This is my wife Lisa. -Hello. I represent the people of Hooterville, who were tricked into selling their farms by your agent, one Mr. Haney. Oh, well, now, that's impossible. I mean, Armstrong Development Corporation simply does not conduct its business in that manner. Nonetheless, it happened. I know, I know what it is. I know exactly what it is. You see, I put my son in charge of this project. That's it. Probably in a burst of eagerness to please the old man, he just went too far. Oh, yes. Ladies and gentlemen, my apologies. If you don't want to sell, we don't want to buy. You mean, you mean you're going to give us back our deeds? But of course, my dear, absolutely. Just as soon as I can get my lawyers on the telephone. Ooh! Well, well, thank you. Thank you very much. Did you hear that, everyone? [excited shouts] All right, folks. All right. Just calm down, calm down. Even though I'm giving up this Hooterville project, I want you to know that this is still a business establishment. Yes, yes, come on, everybody, we'll celebrate. [excited chatter] Come on, Arnold. Mr. Armstrong, it's been a real pleasure doing business with you. I'll expect a letter of confirmation. -Bye-bye. -[oinking] [Lisa] Come on, Arnold. Bye! This is E. Mitchell. Yeah. I want those bulldozers over to Hooterville immediately. Level it. [laughs wickedly] [car horn honking] Oh, Oliver, I'm so proud of you. You were wonderful. -Yeah, I was, wasn't I? -[Lisa chuckles] -I never had so much fun practicing law in years. -[laughter] Listen everybody, Mr. Douglas is going to take us to lunch. Yeah, yeah. The World Trade Center. Oh, we don't have to walk, do we? Not if there are taxis. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! [blows whistle] Come on, taxi. Oliver. Oliver. Hurry up, Oliver. [driver] Where to, shorty? [oinking] [Daisy] Arnold. Arnold! Stop! -Arnold! Arnold! -Arnold! [yelling] [all yelling] -[Daisy] Arnold! -[Eb] Arnold, come back. [Drucker] Come back! Uh, officer, we need to report a missing-- Name? Arnold Ziffel. [police officer] Age? Uh, officer, if I could explain. One at a time, please. One at a time. -Miss? -Five years old. -What was he wearing? -Nothing. Hates clothes, huh? My little guy's the same way. If I could just interrupt for one-- Quiet! Miss, don't you worry. We're going to find your boy. We're talking about a pig! Hey, my kid's a slob, too. Follow me over to that policeman and give him a detailed description. No, officer, uh... [indistinct chatter] No, the nose is flatter and the ears more pointy. All due respect, Miss, he's beginning to look like a-- Pig! That's what I've been trying to tell you. [playing harmonica] Oh, look. Look! There he is. Arnold! Arnold! [Drucker] Hey, Arnold! Arnold! [squealing] Oh, no! [Alf] Hey, put him down! Arnold, don't go... Get outta there. Arnold! They're going to sweet and sour him! Arnold is not just a pig! He's a member of the family! He just jumped into a taxi and-- Th-th-that's all, folks. He jumped into the taxi, and the next... Come on, everybody, I found it. Hurry up. Come on. Hurry up. Oh, no! Arnold? [squealing from inside] Arnold! -Oh, oh, don't do that! -No! Out of kitchen! Aah! [yelling in Chinese] Chef, darling, do you speak English? [yells] Ai! Do you do takeout? Yeah, sure. We'll take that one. [Eb] Hi, Flo, honey. Eb! Hi, sweetie. Boy, have I got news for you. You got any news for me? No, not yet. But soon. What? We don't have to move? Mr. Armstrong backed right down? I know it's 'cause you're there, Eb. I just know it. Wait until I tell... Jeb, it's your daddy. We won. Construction's been canceled. No, it hasn't, Dad. There's bulldozers and trucks and construction crews all over town. Everything's changing. Hooterville's finished. But Mr. Armstrong said that-- Dad, come on home and let's get packed up and move someplace cool. Later, son. Mr. Armstrong lied to us. There are construction crews all over Hooterville! Well, they can't do that to us. Aren't there such things as writs and injunctions and court orders? That's right, Mr. Douglas. Let's habeas him right on his corpus. No, no, that won't work. I've read the contract. I've reread the contract. I've re-reread the contract. It's an ironclad contract. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, Oliver. If there was a way, you would have found the will. Well, there's nothing left to do except go back to Hooterville and pack. Well, I'm not walking all the way back to that train station. Me, neither. I want to get home as soon as I can. [Daisy] God, it just doesn't seem fair, us being the losers and Armstrong the winner. Oliver, do you remember Count Yankovic? That guy from Budapest with the goose grease in his hair? Yes. Yes, the handsome nobleman who wanted to marry me. And you wanted me, too. You challenged him. Do you remember what happened? Yes. He broke my knee in three places. It still hurts now when it rains. But you won! Because you never said ankle. Uncle. Well, the point is that to me, Mr. Armstrong is just another Count Goose Flesh. Well, thanks, you two. No, Daisy, wait. Lisa's right. We're saying ankle... I mean uncle too quickly. Okay, maybe we can't defeat Armstrong in the courts. That doesn't mean we have to give up. We can fight. We will fight! Armstrong may have the deeds to our farms, but not to our spirits, our dreams, our future! Those cannot be sold! Oliver, your spark plugs are back! Right! [Oliver over megaphone] All right, everyone, once again... [all chanting] Save our town! Put Armstrong down! Save our town! Put Armstrong down! Save our town! Put Armstrong down! Save our town! Put Armstrong down! Save our town! Come on, son. This is your town. Join the fight. Why should I, Dad? If you stop them, all I get is Hooterville. At least they're making the town better. -Yeah. -Yeah. Bigger maybe, but not better. Man, this is our home. I grew up here. You grew up here. Dad, you have to make way for progress. I'm sorry you feel that way, Jeb, 'cause one of these days you're gonna want to come back here and it'll be gone. And maybe then you'll realize that Hooterville was worth fighting for. I'm sorry, Dad. Hang in there, buddy. This whole thing is making me lose my appetite. Save our town! Put Armstrong down! Save our town! Put Armstrong down! -Save our town! -Traitor! [Oliver over Megaphone] Mr. Haney, you're not welcome here! Oh, now, Mr. Douglas, you've got it all wrong. I'm here to lend my support. [jeering] You take that sign and that truck and yourself -and get out of here! -[all] Yeah! I knew you was going to be hard to deal with. Okay, 10% discount for the first three customers. [booing] Twenty percent discount? [booing] Carry your suitcase for a quarter? [booing] Ladies and gentlemen, you're all wasting your time. Just go home. [man] You go home! This is all a big mistake. You're making a very big mistake. Hi, Dad. The situation's got out of control. Haven't I taught you anything? I was just trying to convince-- Don't talk back to me, sonny. You're off this job. I want you to go back to that hotel and start packing. -Dad, I was just trying to-- -Move it! Bedford! All right, let's go, bring on that squad. I want to see it now. Come on, move it! Deploy, deploy! [yelling] All right, you cowards, go ahead, shoot. Shoot an old man trying to defend his home. -Yeah, shoot him. -[woman] No, no! You people, you're all trespassing. We are not leaving! You cannot intimidate us! And you can't scare us, either. -[woman 1] Yeah! -[woman 2] That's right! Well, I already have, Mr. Douglas. You know, smart people are willing to accept their defeats. What's your problem? This isn't about winning or losing. It's about families, homes, tradition. The very backbone of our entire country! You've got quite a way with words, Mr. Douglas. Write a book. He's the organizer. Put him in jail. No, not Mr. Douglas! Not so fast, Mr. Armstrong. You know, Mr. Douglas might be right. He said you have all the money and all the machines in the world, But we have the love of our land behind us, and no bulldozer's stronger than that. Arrest him. [Daisy] No! No! He's not the organ grinder. I am. Now what are you going to do about it? Well, in that case, we'll just forget about him. Arrest her! Now! Oh! Oh! Don't you touch me! [Lisa] Oh, Oliver, I'm so upset. [Oliver] Keep your spirits up now. The fight's not over. Oh, it isn't about the fight. It's about my blouse. The polka dots are clashing with the bars. Well, close your eyes, dear. I'm trying to think of what to do next. I told Vito this town wasn't ready for me, but he wouldn't listen. He said the place was expanding. "Peaches," he said, "you gotta get here early, establish yourself a corner, build up a clientele." So look what happens. I get here, there is no corner, and the lone ranger out there hauls me in! Well, why don't you forget about all that and get yourself a nice indoor job? Oh, I do my best work indoors. Excuse me. Excuse me. This one is mine, honey. Okay, honey, don't shoot. Hey, Arnold. Daisy, don't go. Uh, I'm leaving. For good. I just came to say goodbye. Bye. Uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to walk me to the train station. I wouldn't walk two feet with you, Brad Armstrong. Knowing you has been nothing but bad news to me. [oinking] Whoa! You're never gonna make your train if you keep stopping to rest every five minutes. Could you give me a hand? Whoa! [laughing] You see, the country and me, we just don't mix. I don't know. You know, you just have to be willing to get a little bit dirty. [laughing] See that old oak tree? That's where I used to wait for the school bus. I went to boarding school. -Oh, did you hate it? -No, I loved it. It was home I hated. Smell that? [sniffs] No. It's newly mown hay. Go on and fill your lungs up with it. Daisy, it'll only make me sneeze. No, try it. Like this. [inhales] [exhales] [laughs] Well, I suppose I could give it a try. [inhales] [exhales] That was great. Thanks. I'll think of you every time I breathe. Don't want to miss your train. It really is beautiful out here. And soon it'll all be gone, replaced by foul air and dirty water and big industry. No, it won't, Daisy. I'm not gonna let that happen. It is, huh? Real good. Okay, Fred. Yep. Call you back, Harvey. We have to talk. Look at you. You're disgusting. Dad, you have to cancel the Hooterville project. Dad doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to do. There are plenty of places where people want to sell the land. Why not build there? Because I've targeted this place. Because I think I've hit a bull's-eye. Because there's lots of time and money invested. Now, unless you have something more worthwhile to talk about, will you forgive me, I want to inspect my property. Well, now, Dad, you listen to me. I've always gone along with everything you've said because, well, I always thought you were right. But this time you've made a mistake. There are good people here, and you're hurting them deeply. But it's not too late. You can call the board, call 'em up in New York And tell 'em you're canceling this project. Go on, Dad, do it! You know, I've waited 20 years for you to stand up to me, son. I'm proud of you. Then you'll do it? Not on your life. Now you get out of here before I call the State Troopers. Go on! Uh, Timmy. I want to speak to you. I told you, don't call me Timmy. I'm Sheriff Bedford. Is my badge on straight? Yes, but your chest is crooked. I insist that you release us on our own recognizance. Sorry, I can't hear you. You have no right to hold us here! A complaint has been lodged. We have to speak to the judge, and he is away fishing. Oh. Mr. Douglas, Mrs. Douglas, you have to help me. We have to stop my father. Well, of course we do. Just tell him to build his town someplace else. I did. I just came from there. But nobody can tell my father anything. Why, is he hard of listening? Now, hold it right there, you. This is a... Oh, good evening, Mr. Armstrong. And how is your father doing this evening? You tell him thanks for that cd player. -I'll do that, Sheriff Bedford. -Call me Timmy. Listen, my father has a message for you, too, Timmy. Um, he's dropping the complaints against the Douglases. You can release them immediately. Anything you say. Excuse me. Okay, you mug shots, you're free... for now. "Mug shots." Mr. Douglas, we need a plan fast. I think it's time we pulled a few strings. Oliver, darling, don't blame yourself. If anybody could have gotten Hootersville back, it was you. Come on, darling. Loosen up. Your neck is full of knots and I can't un-knots them. I thought my plan would work, Lisa. I was sure the Governor would listen. Hooterville carried him in the last election. How could you know that the governor was Mr. Armstrong's cousin? Ah, what's the use? Tomorrow we'll be on a train to New York and all this will be behind us. Hey, what's going on? Let's check it out. Hey, kids, you gotta move away from them stakes. Why? Bulldozers are coming in to grade this piece of land, fill in the pond. Maybe my dad is right. Hey, cut it out! You can keep putting them back in the ground if you want, but I'm just gonna pull 'em out again. My dad, he taught me how to swim in that pond. My friends and I, we built our first tree house in that tree. I'm glad you had a beautiful life. But you pull one more stake out of the ground, and I'll put it through your heart. You don't scare me, mister. Touch him, mister, and you answer to us. Who do you think you are? We're the kids from Hooterville. Yeah, that's right. And proud of it. You're gonna have to go over us to get by. [sneezes] Don't worry. Your nose will calm down just as soon as you get back to the city. Oh, I'm really looking forward to that. So, have you given any thought to where you're going? Mmm. California, maybe. -[sneezes] -Or Oregon. They say they have a real long growing season out there. What about New York? Me in the city, yeah, what would I do? Well, there's lots you could do. You could open up a nursery. You could do landscaping, Custom work on terraces. Then we could get married and you could open up a store all over the city. And, uh... Once that gets going, you could maybe write a book on landscaping. Whoa, whoa, Brad, slow down. Do you want to just say that one more time, please? Sure. You could open up a nursery and maybe do some landscaping-- No, not that far back. You mean the part about you and me getting married? Yeah, that's the one. Daisy, will you marry me? Oh, Brad. [sneezes] Gesundheit. Oh, dear. -Guess what! -What? Brad and I are getting married. Hey. How about that? That's wonderful news. He's going to treat you like a queen for the rest of your life, As long as you put him on the throne. I'm gonna write Mr. Haney a thank-you note. I mean, after all, it was his phony earthquake scheme that brought Brad and me together anyway. You mean it was Haney's fault? [laughter] Oliver, are you thinking what I am thinking? I doubt that. Because if I am thinking what you are thinking, then I am thinking that I think we might not have to think anymore. What do you think? What are you think... What are you talking about? Come over here. Fabulous idea. [rumbling] [whipping noises] It's working! [glass shatters] [screams] Come on, honey. Come on. That's it, we're leaving! You didn't mention in the brochure that you had earthquakes! Earthquakes? In Hooterville? Impossible! Come on, dear. No refund on the weekly rate. [Oliver] That's the stuff. Now you're going. Louder! Louder! That's it. Give it to 'em. I'll get you for this, Haney, you son of a snake. I'll get you. For what? For what? For not telling me this whole town's built on a fault. I assure you, Mr. Armstrong, Hooterville is solid as a rock. I don't know what's going on here. Why, you're a bigger liar than I am, Haney! Argh! Stop it! Stop it! -Hold it! -[whistles] This whole project is canceled! If the people of Hooterville want this shaky ground so much, they can have it! Ah! Wake up, you lout! We're leaving! Good evening, Mr. Armstrong. Lovely evening here in Hooterville, isn't it? What are you talking about? We just had a major earthquake. That little tickle? Oh, you should be here when we have the big tickle. What? This sort of thing goes on all the time? Sure. Why do you think everyone sold out so fast? Oh, there's something wrong with you people. Not anymore. Bye. Bye-bye. Whoo! Have a good trip! [cheering] -There you are. Where's Lisa? -I don't know. We're gonna miss that train. Lisa? I'm sorry, darling. I was putting on the finishing touches. What is it? I painted you a painting to hang in your office Instead of the pitchfork. Oh, oh, one of your New York skyline pictures. That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you. Darling, you don't want my skylines. Look. Green Acres! Oh, that's beautiful. Do you really like it? Oh, yeah. I didn't know you could paint anything like this. Well, I discovered what I was doing wrong. I wasn't painting from my heart. That's where my spark plugs are, painting what I really love. [Eb] Come on, Mom and Dad, we'd better get going. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Lisa, did you say you loved Green Acres? Yes, I... I guess I really do. I thought you loved New York. Well, I love you. And I said that I loved New York because you are so happy there. I'm miserable! I just pretended I loved New York because I thought you did. Well, if we both love it here, why are we going there? Yeah! Why are we going to New York? We're not going to New York. All right! Mr. Haney, Mr. Haney. I want to buy back Green Acres. I had a feeling you was gonna have a change of heart, Mr. Douglas. I got the bill of sale right there. Oh! What's the matter, spell your name wrong? -Oh! -What's so, "oh." This is three times what you paid for it just last month! Well, I've made a lot of major improvements. What improvements? That skylight in the living room. Skylight? The roof fell in! And the landscaping alone. Landscaping? You drove a bulldozer across my front yard! Well, just the same, improvements are improvements. Yes, they are, if you have the permits. Mr. Kimball. Aren't there some serious fines for making improvements without permits? Oh, yeah, serious. Uh, well, yeah, a lot more than serious. -They're costly. -Costly? Well, maybe not costly-- And, Mr. Kimball, wouldn't you say that a smart man would do much better by unloading his property quickly rather than running up those costly fines? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I'd unload that property right now, Mr. Haney. Well, maybe not right now... Yeah, right now with that pre-permit price. Without making a profit? Oh, I do believe I'd better sit down. Mr. Douglas, it's a d-d-d... He says it's a deal! [cheering] You did it, Dad! You did it, Mom! We sure did. All right, yeah! I'm sure glad you're gonna be around, grandpa. You, too, grandma. Call me Mrs. Douglas. Mrs. Douglas. Yeah! Come on, guys, let's go to the pond. -See you later. -See you later. See you later. -Nice bit of negotiating, Mr. Douglas. -Thank you, Brad. Welcome home, neighbor. Ohh! Thank you, Daisy. Come on, Brad, let's go back inside and do some... More weeding. Boy, do I love the country! Oliver, why don't you and I go and do some weeding? Oh, for... Okay! Boy, oh, boy, this has been some day, huh? Ah! Ah! It's not over yet! Golly! Triplets? No wonder she looked like an overstuffed strudel. -Hello, Eleanor. -[Eleanor moos] I guess we owe Eb another three acres. Oh, Oliver, you will have to have a word with Eb.
