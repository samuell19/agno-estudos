The dragon... A legendary being? No. It lives. It sleeps... ... in the human heart. Hey! You'll get hurt! Come down! Come down! You'll get hurt! Come down! It's all right. Dragon was awakened by the accident. The damage occurred here... ... in the part of the brain inherited unchanged from our reptile ancestors. The part that controls emotions and acts of desire. How do we repress the animal instinct to explode? What saved him from ruin was... ... THE ELECTRIC GUITAR!!! He conducts electricity! He talks to reptiles! He's the man! 'Dragon Eye'! 'Dragon Eye' Morrison!!! White powder. You're better off with me. Nothing can be traced back. I'm a lot safer. Praise be! I am blessed! Buy yourself something nice. Thank you! Reptile Investigator Call 'Dragon Eye' Morrison "No, this is the first time" it's ever happened. I see. I've already got the extra. Well... Just a minute... Sorry. "I don't doubt you, but there's" not much point in continuing. Lost: Lizard Call Morrison Someone might have it in his car. Lost: Lizard Call Morrison I can only do so much. I'm not going to give up. I see. I'm sorry we always talk by phone. I'll see what I can do. I'll make sure we meet soon. Look forward to it. Enter the CHALLENGER!!! He's the electricity man! All its wavelengths are his! The mystery man... Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt Buddha!!! That's the one. That's not enough. Take care of it. Find another way. Or else there'll be trouble. Just a minute. It's me. You got it? Didn't you hear me? Wait. I'm at the office. "White or yellow, I don't care. " Put some make-up over the track marks. That way they won't show. I'm getting mad! Have you got the races on? No. Oh. I can't take any more! GUITAR! Lost: Lizard Call Morrison "Now, that's power!" Lost: Lizard Don't piss me off! Why did you make me mad?! I wanted to see you angry. Let's send them to hell! Your demons and mine! You go to hell! Do it! More! More! More! MORE! Lightning struck me. It gave me 20 million volts! "You've only got 80,000. " "If I hit you 250 times, " that's 20 million volts! Conserve electricity! See ya! Got to buy a guitar. Got to buy a guitar... GUITAR!!!
