What's this? - Why are you behaving like this? - Stop, you jerks! - What the fuck do you want? - Leave her alone! - What do you want? - Get lost! Do you hear me? - You're a coward! You piece of shit! - Let's go! - Come on. - I'll punch you! - Fucking nigger. Come on. - Let's go. My name is Basim. Thank you. Anna? Oh, Anna! Where are you going? I am going to the north of Europe. I love walking. I used to make these for my sister. Why don't you speak? I have to imagine all your answers. Can't you see? The bus is not coming. I have to go. Do you want to come with me? Shall we go? I'm off. Good luck. - Hi. - Hi. Thank you. Go. Go to Anna. Listen. No. - Come on. - You can't have this. - A bit of sunbathing. - Fine. Look, Dad. - What? - The sun.

You have done a good job. Come back tomorrow, okay? Come back tomorrow. Brothers and sisters. Today, John teaches us to ponder the deep meaning of being a Christian. Our faith is born through a special encounter. The encounter with Jesus Christ, who died and was then resurrected. He asks us, his people, to follow him, and recognize the good shepherd who looks after his flock. He loves us, he looks after us. And for these reasons, we follow him, we trust him, and we are no longer afraid, disillusioned, or selfish. He calls us by our name. He leads us towards that door. He is at the door, as John reminds us, through which we will reach salvation. This path ahead of us will take us to real life. Thus, we need to go back to Jesus Christ, we need to recognize his voice, so we can forever change our lives. Anna, let's go. Do you like it? I found everything myself. Sit down. Are you hungry? I'll prepare something to eat. DICTIONARY Clean those. You are a hard worker. You can't speak. It's not important to me that you don't speak. I don't speak too much myself. I have so much to hide. Otherwise, I wouldn't live here, hidden by flowers. Stop it! That is a rare thing. They must stay together. Basim gets on the field. He's going to do his little training. I'm doing some training. He's approaching. He goes around. He's getting in the game. He has the ball. Basim. Basim has the ball, he's running, he's moving to the side. He heads out, he comes back. Dodges this one, dodges that one. He comes back to the side. He rushes down the field. He dribbles. He's turning and turning. Looking for company? - Do you talk to everyone? - Everyone stops to talk to Stella. And will they tell you their business? It depends. Did anyone tell you if they saw a girl with light hair and a green sweatshirt? As pretty as me? I don't like your fucking jokes! Fuck you! How do I look? See? I managed to make you smile. Do you like being alone? See you later. Don't go tonight. - Anna, don't start. - It's late. We have an arrival tonight. You do exactly what he does. You are no different from him. It's my job. That is not a job. It's shit. Manfredi is shit. Where are you going? - To see my dad. - I'll give you a lift. - Is everything okay? - Yes. She protects people who live by the sea. We all need protection. Aren't you afraid of being all alone? I am not alone. If I am with you, you have no reason to be afraid. Answer it. Would you rather chat with me? Go away. Anna. Come here. Come. You do it now. Make it a bit shorter. Otherwise, it stands like... Put it in that, too. Put in... This one too. Cut it, don't be afraid. Good. Where do you think those will look good? A gift! I moved the ball with the midfielder. Come on. No. Again with my men. I play... No. The Ivory Coast team should be super strong. The ball to the Ivory Coast defense. Goal! Foutou. My grandmother taught me how to cook it. It's very important for us. Eat. Eat, Anna. I'm looking for a young girl who's about 16. Her name is Anna and she's not from here. There are many young girls... Someone is looking for you. Don't worry. You can stay here with me. Nobody will find you here. Here. Finish with this. What can I do for you? You can give me a hand. Do you want some flowers? Too delicate, they die too soon. It's my job... to protect fragile things. It's a mistake to feel sorry for delicate things. You are wrong. Goodbye. Where is she? - Are you okay? - Yes. Are you sure? Do you know what we'll do? I'll take you fishing tomorrow. A peaceful place. You let the nigger escape. I didn't do anything. Do you know what will happen if these people escape? This job is based on trust. I can't do this job anymore! I paid off my debt. There are debts you can't ever really pay off. With this job, we fed you and your daughter. Don't you dare mention Anna. Why? She has grown up. Little Anna has grown up to be pretty. I said don't mention her! Do you get upset over small things? Do you want to play the hero... because I talked about your daughter? Don't you dare talk about Anna! Don't mention her name! Basim! Basim. Hey, Basim! - Stop, Basim. - No. Wait. Stay with me for a while. I said no! - Come on. Take it. - I don't want your money. Come on, Basim. - Don't touch me! - Come on. I told you not to touch me. Don't touch me! Okay? Don't touch me anymore! Bastard! Nothing happened, Anna. It's okay, Anna. Don't worry, I'm okay. Don't look at me like that. You can't look at me like that, Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! What are you running away from? I know you can speak. Let her go! I wouldn't run if I were you. You can't behave like this, do you understand? Why did you run away, Anna? I would have never harmed you. Never ever, Anna. Do you want to get me in trouble? I want to protect you. I don't want you to be alone. Anna, the world is horrible when you are alone. Why don't you want to be close to me? Why? I am the one who has to look after you. I looked for you everywhere. Everywhere. Anna, you are alone like me! We can be together. Don't be my enemy. Why are you doing this to me, Anna? Why? Why, Anna? Why, Anna? I will protect you. Basim. TWIN FLOWER
