Why can't you use the back foot to board? Sir, always take risks in life. Did you find my bus to take risks? Conductor, don't scold me. Today is my birthday. So what? Free to do anything? Get lost! - Ticket to Central... - Take it... Hello, don't buy ticket... What happened to you? I'm going to make your journey a memorable, it's my birthday treat. I didn't get you. I'll buy tickets for you all. I've bought my ticket. It's okay... no problem... You take back the ticket and pay money. Good citizen! - Thank you! - Okay. He is a good person. Take and give tickets to all of them. You distribute the tickets and return the balance. He has bought tickets for all of you, hasn't he? Why don't you wish him on his birthday? Happy birthday to you! All of you be ready with your tickets. Show your tickets. Mind your work, man. Ticket please... show me your ticket. He has bought tickets for all of us. Show me their tickets. I've bought all the tickets. Today is my birthday. So I wanted to travel alone in the bus... But a crowd came. I've bought the tickets but I'm standing. Look at them sitting happily without tickets. Talking rubbish? What about their tickets then? How should I know? What happens when you don't have a ticket? Rs.500 fine. Okay! If they don't pay? 6 months imprisonment! All fraudsters, pay the fine. Why did you cheat us? - I'll pay you, return my ticket. - Give me Rs.4.50 ticket. Wait... Hey, please return the tickets... Rs.2 ticket for Rs.4. Rs.4 for Rs.8. And Rs.8 for Rs.10. Rs.2 for Rs.4, Rs.4 for Rs.8. And Rs.8 for Rs.10. Give it or it'll be a fine or 6 months in jail. The fine is Rs.500. Rs.2 ticket for 4. - Hey, you're a bloody crook. Hey, you're one to talk! You got paid for a used ticket.7 Am I a cheat if I sell the tickets I bought for all of you? You're talking too much. For you a Rs.4 ticket is Rs.40. He wants a fine! Rs.2 for Rs.4. Rs.4 for Rs.8. Rs.8 for Rs.10. It's free for you. Rs.2 for Rs.4. Rs.4 for Rs.8. And Rs.8 for Rs.10. For me too? Oh! You're the conductor? Sorry. If you delay further... Rs.2 tickets will go up to Rs.10. The fine is Rs.500 or spend 6 months in jail. What is going on here? There is a small function in our area. I'm collecting funds. - I'm confused! Whatever it is, everyone has tickets. You're the 1st man in the world black marketing tickets in a running bus. Thiru, why do you look lost? You're here on time. Is the poster ready? - Did you finish everything else? - Yes we did. Why is he shouting like this? This dumb wants us to paste the poster before the auspicious time elapses. Are you a great man? Come on... Being dumb you're already such a pain in the neck. What if you could talk? Paste it, buddy. You should've gotten a double sheet poster. Paste it. Hey Thiru, Valarmathi looks beautiful in her half sari. She bloomed like a flower unnoticed. The poster is good. Isn't she beautiful? The next one should be pasted on Valarmathi's house. We congratulate Valarmathi for her coming of age and for growing into a beautiful woman. Regards, 5 Stars Group. Thiru stares... ... and laughs... Thiru stares... ... and laughs... Thiru stares... ... and laughs... Dance baby! Dance baby! Fragrance all over the streets... ... I wonder which flower has bloomed today. Has Valarmathi of door No: 7 come to age...? Let her maternal uncle build the customary hut... Let me paste posters wishing her good luck... A bud has bloomed into flower... Demand honey from it... A chick has grown into a hen... celebrate it... Cocks call an urgent meeting to celebrate the event... Dance baby! Dance baby! Dance baby! Dance baby! Long skirts have become Salwar suits... and it is making young men to lose their sleep... If girls stop coming out... the streets become lifeless... and life becomes tasteless... What should be done? Why should young women hide in homes? This orthodox custom should be banned... Respect our desires... Think about your past... Past is past... Now the days are colorful... Will you lose your chastity if we look at you? Dance baby! Dance baby! I'm not the Cupid... But still I have desires... In the moonlight... with the waves caressing our legs... won't I be lucky to embrace my sweetheart? Love is like the elections... Take the lead in canvassing yourself... Make hay when the sun shines... Adjust love to your requirements... If I see an angel... if I fall in love with her... I'll chose an auspicious date... to marry and enjoy... Dance baby! Dance baby! Fragrance all over the streets... ... I wonder which flower has bloomed today. Has Valarmathy of door No: 7 come of age...? Let her maternal uncle build the customary hut... Let me paste posters wishing her good luck... A bud has bloomed into a flower... Demand honey from it... A chick has grown into a hen... celebrate it... Cocks call an urgent meeting to celebrate the event... Dear residents of Ayanavaram Aandalpuram, on the occasion of Valarmathi's coming of age, we are distributing free Turkey biryani. In the presence of the former President of the 5 Stars Group, Mr. Angusamy, and his brother, Mr. Pangusamy, the present President Mr. Thiru will distribute it. Give them a big applause. We missed out on all this fun in our times, men used to come, have a feast and walk out. I'm very happy to see you celebrating the event. - Long live the 5 Stars group! - Thanks to the well wisher. What's it, Thiru? Just biryani? No drinks? Brother, I too would like it. But it's financially difficult. Saraswathi should come of age next week. - I'll arrange it then. - Long live. Hey, people are coming in autos to get free food. This is not a new problem. This has been going for 20 long years. When will this end? Nobody knows it! Why did you paste posters for our area girl's coming of age? It was your duty to do it. But you failed to do it. So Thiru had to sell bus tickets in the black market. You shouldn't have paste it! If you can ogle girls in my area, why can't I paste posters for your area's girls? - You shouldn't have paste it! - We will. If you've guts, stop us. - We will kill you... - Try it... Thiru is running away. Where is the stick? Oh God! Hello... - Yes, come in. The day I saw you... - My name is Mala. Hey! Come on, man. Read my message. I'm a good man. I can't bear it if you beat me. Don't insult me by beating me in public. Basically, I'm an orphan. Yours -Tiger Kumar. It's me! - Yuck! They are beating mercilessly. - Have a drink. What are you doing, buddy? - Mixing! Beat the drums. The police! Hey, what's the trouble here? Sir, I'm blind... - What's going on here? I'm a stranger. - What's the problem? I know, sir... - I don't know, sir. - Hey, who was that? Who hit him? Who is it? Tell me... Did you stone him? - No. I'll tell you who hit him with a stone, and who is responsible for this skirmish. - What? I swear, trust me. I know his address. Tell me. Hey, is it No:16? - Yes. Sir, what's this? Why did you give your address? He is my son. I swear, he is my son. He is having his food inside. If you go silently, you can catch him. Hey follow me... Didn't I tell you not to make noise? Brother Swaminatha... - Get lost! Search him there. Where is mom? Mom is here! Mom, police has come... ask them to go... Isn't ours respectable family? - Okay... let's see... - Take him, sir... - Mother... Yes I'm your mother. Take him. - Come on... Sir, just a minute... A mother must be like an angel. She shouldn't betray. Nothing less in this! Sir, add this to the charge sheet. Go man... you will get stick there! Leave me, sir. I'll kill him and come. Hey, stop beating him... - Leave him First take him away. Hey, Specty! I'll come back and see you! Why are you shouting at me sir? Do you know who my father is? - Who is he? If I inform my father, you will be dismissed. Your father helped us catch you. - What? Dad, what's this? We failed as parents, but the police will straighten you up. A few days in jail will reform you. Take him away. If your father had done this to you, you would've known it. - Go man... - Take off your hand, sir... Don't know when he is going to reform and settle in life? Look at his appearance and his dress. What's your name? You're police, aren't you? Find out... - What? We had printed our names in the poster, hadn't we? Read it... What's your name? - Tiger Kumar. - Tiger Kumar? - Dared hit me? Are you great Tiger? He loves the Puli brand... that's why he's Tiger Kumar. What? Puli means Tiger! That's why Tiger Kumar. The inspector doesn't know that "puli" means "tiger" in Tamil. Your name? - What? - Sir, he is a dumb. Good morning, sir. - Your name? - Yamaha Raji. - Do you own a Yamaha bike? He steals bikes. Nothing less in this! Five Stars group! Whether Valarmathi comes of age or not, what's it to you? Why did you paste posters all over the area? Sir, if any MLA or MP or a Party secretary visits, they splash the city with posters. Valarmathi is our girl. - So? When they paste posters whether they win or lose, why not for Valarmathi, who will come of age only once? You should not! - Why sir? You should not! - Give me the reason! Because Valarmathi is my daughter! Sorry sir. No use of saying sorry now. Back from school? Back from jail? Starting all over again? Behave like a younger brother. Behave like an elder brother. How can I love such a boy? - Keep quiet. Rap... rap on my head as you please. I'm tired. I'll do it after eating. No way! How did he come home? Mother brought him back. Why did you bring him here? I'm asking you... why did you bring him here? What are you talking? He is our son. Great son! I feel ashamed of him. Always loitering around, or in a bar, Now police station! That's why I didn't want to come here. You didn't listen to me. You could've gone elsewhere. Mother, ask him to mind his words. Or I may be forced to talk. What will you say? Can't even find a job for yourself! Arguing with me. I can't work for others! - Why can't you keep quiet? What else will you do? I'll start a business. I've been asking for a hundred thousand for the past 6 months. You turn deaf to it. Do you know the meaning of business? Why not? Keep quiet. - Leave me, mother. I'll do business in real estate like you. Impossible! Listen, I've already invested 2.5 millions on a land trusting a man, and I've been struggling for 6 months. I can't sell it nor get back my money. Business isn't a joke. I won't get cheated like you! Mother, I didn't ask him to take a loan. I'm asking him to give me his savings. Listen, I have already lost enough I don't want to lose my savings on you and end up on the streets. You trusted an outsider and invested 2 millions. Why don't you entrust a hundred thousand to your son? I wouldn't entrust a rupee to him, let alone thousands. If you don't, I'll live on my own. I'll do what I want then. Then you don't have the right to live in my house. I'll go then... - Go... Just a minute... Don't tell anyone you're my son. It's not something I tell people. He hasn't eaten yet. Ask him to eat first. - You stupid woman! Does he look hungry? He has loaded fully, just his face is like that. Yes father. He had 7 dosas. - Don't I know? Oh my God! Add numbers in your books. Not on how much I eat! Get lost, you pig. Hey dumb, don't drink too much, I won't be able to answer your father then. Come, Thiru... I was worried you wouldn't come to foot the bill. Speaks in English after few pegs. Why are you dull? My dad refused to invest money in my business. My dad won't give me money even for bus fares. Your dad is far better. Why fathers don't trust their sons? All fathers consider themselves as God fathers. But actually they're bad fathers! Well said, boss. Hi everybody! I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park. Oh I see... Glad to meet you. - What? Granny is missing? No. I said I'm happy to meet you. If you don't mind, can I have a cigarette? Oh Yes, take it. Hey, don't give him. No problem. He may mistake you. - Not at all... Hey, he is from Tidel Park. Please have it, sir. Sorry for disturbance... - No problem. - Please carry on... - Okay. Sorry... - Okay sir. My mother tried a lot, but my father isn't convinced. All our fathers are making our mothers worthless. You're right! I'm Venugopal, from Tidel Park. - You said this earlier, sir. If you don't mind, can I have little Pepsi? Give him. Enough. Thank you. Carry on... What happened to you? Friend, life has become a bore. Only life should get bored of us, not we. Well said, sir. I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park. You said this thrice. What do you want now? If you don't mind... Can I have a peg? Thank you. Thank you. You carry on... No one... No one cares for us. Father isn't giving me money. Banks are rejecting my loan applications. Buddy, the bank has no authority to reject you loans. We will lend money to the banks. We will definitely reach the top. Impossible! It's impossible for me to walk. Then will you run? - I'm Venugopal from... - Tidel Park. A big request... Oh no! I'm finished. I'm fully drunk. - You will since you get it freely. I don't like walking... Venu, shall I get you an auto? No need. If you give me money, I'll catch an auto and go home. What else then? Would you like to come with me? What did you ask me? Money. Don't you have money then? I always come here without money. Hey, you told us that you're from Tidel Park. What does it mean? I'll get tight drunk and sleep in a park. Is it not a Software Company? What does it mean? Hey, watching the show? Beat him. You want an auto to sleep in the park? He has come! Had food, mother? Oh no! He is calling me "mother"! What's the time now? I can't sleep tonight. Didn't I ask you? What's the time now? Means? Dad, he is saying it's 17. 17? - What happened? Mom, he is drunk. Mother... Why are you beating him? He is more matured than you. You will know his true color when he becomes like me. Don't worry about that. He will be a Collector at your age. No way! Getting drunk, why are you behaving cheaply? You will never come up in your life! I'll also succeed in my life. First stand straight. I know, you can't do it. Didn't you yell at me for not give him money? If I had given him, he would've spent it on drinks. Don't talk when you didn't do it. First give me money... - You'll never come back here. Why are you behaving like this? He refused to give me money so I got drunk. I got drunk so I lost my bike. What? You lost your bike? Is it? Very good! He has done a great job! In spite of his warnings, I sold my jewels and bought you a bike. How can you be so careless? Where did you lose it? No. He didn't lose it. He pledged it to have drinks. I'm not lying. I lost the bike. Talking philosophy in drunken stupor? I swear, he has sold his bike. Didn't I tell you that I lost my bike? Won't you believe me? - How dare to shout at me? You're grown up, so I don't want to beat you. And you yell at me when after misbehaving? - Get out... - Hubby... You keep quiet. I say get out from here. Why should I? Because this is my house. Find your bike or don't come back. Mother, whatever you say, I can't come. I won't! Hang up the phone... What boss? Have you also lost your bike? My parents fixed my marriage. I don't like her. - Why boss? When we see a girl, we should feel like living with her and sacrificing our life for her. We shouldn't think of running away like I did. I didn't get you. I'll explain it to you. - Yes, tell me. Brother, when we see a girl, we must feel the heat of fire. Fire? - Yes. Oh Lord! The fire has come! Great fire! Oh no! My bike! I'm Venugopal from Tidel Park. Thirukumaran from Ayanavaram. Nice. You're really brilliant. You found it within a day! I appreciate you! Priest, offer special prayers in his name. - Okay. Where is your TVS Champ parked? - Parked it outside. Thank god! I got back my bike. Lady luck has graced you, you got back your bike. Once I saw you... you hid my identity within me... You mesmerized me with your smile... You stole my broken heart... I've lost myself... My heart wants you without even knowing your name... You gave me an endless pain... Oh my love! Will you love me? Oh my love! Will you love me? Once I saw you... you hid my identity within me... You mesmerized me with your smile... You stole my broken heart... When you walk on streets... All trees will murmur your name... Sun rises only after seeing you... Who are you? I'm fully shaken because of you... You've made me fall in love with a single glance... Before I express my love, you disappear... Don't go away from me, my sweet heart! I'll die, if you leave me... Once I saw you... you hid my identity within me... You mesmerized me with your smile... You stole my broken heart... You're soft like a flower... The entire world belongs to you... I'm very fortunate to live with you... You are rain bearing cloud... And I'm thirsty of love... I've fallen in love after seeing you... Love has taken deep roots in my heart. My sorrows disappear from today... I've seen my dawn after seeing you... you hid my identity within me... You mesmerized me with your smile... You've stolen my heart... I've lost myself... Oh my love! Will you love me? Oh my love! Will you love me? Hi... - Hi... When did you come here? 2 days back. - I never saw you. What's your name? Urmila. Nice name. - Thank you. I'm Swaminathan. What? - Swaminathan! Oh Swaminathan! Urmi, is your dad rich? Hey, somebody is watching... - Where? There... Who is it? Oh no! You will never leave me in peace! Brother... Brother?! Who is it? Urmila. Urmila?! Hey Swaminatha... Father hopes that you will become a Collector. But I don't think you will even finish high school. Hey you... What is this? Are you using incense sticks for vapor? I'll tell on you... mother... Brother, please don't reveal it... Am I handsome, little brother? Tell me... - Handsome... I'm afraid... That's it! Why have you suddenly become beauty conscious? I saw a girl in the temple... She was very beautiful. I just want to confirm whether we will match. Is she very beautiful? She is a world beauty. - Really? Is she like our Tiger Kumar's sister? Don't compare that ugly duckling with her? Will she look like her? She is an aunt. What about your girl then? She is an extraordinary girl! What about that girl? Tell me brother... I'm asking, tell me! She is the same girl! You fool! Hey, why are you going this side? School is that side... Come on... I'll drop you at the college. Hey, drop me at my school. Keep quiet... - I'll tell father... - Hey, keep quiet... - I'm going to kill you... Police, help me... I'm talking from Pillar signal... A school boy is being kidnapped by a guy on a Yamaha No: 5969. - Follow him immediately. - Please save me... Hey, the police is chasing you... Hey, dad wants me to become a Collector. Stay calm... I'll drop you at the Collector's office. It's my fault for pointing at that girl. Well trapped! Hey, why did you kidnap him? Kidnap? He is my brother. Is it true? - No sir. Hey Swaminatha, I'll talk to dad about Urmila... Who is Urmila? - His girl friend! You too need a girl friend? - Sir, got confused in tension, he's my brother. Kidnapping your own brother? - He saw his girlfriend. He chased after her and forgot to drop me to school. You too have a girlfriend? Not yet confirmed, sir. Your people trust you to drop him to school? Sir... - What? Your girlfriend is on the line. Everybody has a girlfriend. I'll take my leave... You come in after Thiru comes. We will go inside. Why are you shouting? If you go in first can you tell the entire screenplay? Any film is wasting on you. You can't express yourself. Sir, he black marketing tickets. Hi Thiru... Sorry buddy... Film started? Going to start now. Let's go... Who is that girl? Didn't I tell you about a girl? - Yes. That's her! Hi, are you fine? This is our friend, Suri. He's been in love with you for a long time. I told him that you belong to a rich family. And we are from a slum. He says that love has no disparities. So you love him and free us from his torture. What do you say? - Hey you rascal... Are you joking? It's decided... From now on, you are lovers. Leave my hand... Man, take her inside and show her your love. Take her inside... Why are you feeling shy to hold her hand? Take her inside... Stupid fellows! Hey, stop... my sister... Have you seen your face in a mirror? Will you take my sister inside the theater? Do you know who I am? - Who? - I'm an MLA's brother-in-law. Do you know about me? Guru! How dare to touch my sister? Hey, she is Guru's sister! If anyone misbehaves with her, I'll cut him into pieces. Come on, dear... Is he a big goon if he beats 4 people? She has only one brother. But you've 4 friends. We are ready to sacrifice our lives for your love. Don't hope to hear this from us. Is he a human? A lone man is beating 4 people! Forget that girl! You're right, buddy. He has beaten them black and blue for ogling at his sister. If he knows that I love her... He will definitely kill me! Did you expect me to say like this? It's the girl I love. Her range is different from ours. - To hell with your range! Didn't get him? He says accept your limitations and then aim high. Whatever you say... I love her. Why do you want to take risks? I've decided. - It won't happen. It will! - It's impossible! For me, it is possible! I'll make her say 'I love you' to me. And I'll bring her here to meet you. - Hi... - Hi... She is Priya, Thiru's girlfriend. He is Tiger Kumar. - Hi... - Hi, Kumar. This is Yamaha Raj. This is Shiva. He is dumb... - He is Kutty. - Hi Kutty... She fell for him like he said. - How did she fell? He may have fallen at her feet. I heard what you said... Buddy, how did you get her? Actually, when I saw her for the first time... Hey, don't act too smart... I'll explain to them... How did he express his love to you? He didn't express it to me. Then to whom? 108 days earlier... Greetings. What do you want? I want to meet Mr. Guru. Regarding? I love his sister. I want to talk to him about that. Hey, what do you mean? I love his sister. I want to talk to him... ...about that... - Allow him inside. - Okay sir. Greetings, sir. - Sit... What were you blabbering outside? I didn't blabber. I said the truth. Look, today is my birthday. - Happy Birthday, sir. Don't make me tense. Come to the matter. Sir, my name is Thiru. I'm from Ayanavaram. Sir, I love your sister very much. - Hey... I'm in a meeting. I'll get back to you later. What did you say? Excuse... Hey buddy, I'm in an important meeting. I'll call you later. Sorry sir. Does my sister Priya loves you? Is Priya your sister's name? I've seen your sister. But she hasn't seen me. Are you mad? Why sir? You guys will first express your love to your girlfriends. Then to their parents. Why are you telling me? Sir, that's old trend. I just want to try something new... How? You will tell your sister about my visit. Your sister will be eager to see me in person. I believe that this will help develop her love for me. Then? You tell her about my visit. She will definitely ask about me. Look, again I'm warning you... Today is my birthday... I've promised not to hurt anyone. Before I open my eyes, vanish from here. Hey, don't touch... Sir, think again and tell me... Sir, I've come with great hope. Sir, please don't shoot him... Hey, come on... Come... get out... Please explain to him. I've understood everything. Get lost, man. Respect me. - For you?! He seems to be mad! You took out a gun, he wasn't scared. Are you calling him mad? What did you say? You aimed a gun at him, but he stood rock steady, You're calling him mad. Hey, call the person who had just left. He is just leaving on a bicycle. Do you want me to call him? It seems he is going on a bicycle. Bicycle? Brother, why are you laughing? Nothing, Priya. Tell me, brother... It seems a guy loves you... He came and expressed it to me. Me? Yes. How was he? "You tell her about my visit. She will definitely ask about me". Please tell me brother... Why are you bothered about him? Sorry brother. Sorry, I got angry in tension. Okay. Hey, I'll kill you... Just one piece... little... Sir, you're a business magnate. Why are you cooking? What are you talking about? Priya is everything to him. Business comes next. Well said! Who is it? I got a missed call from this number... Sir, it's me! Just Rs.2 balance. That's why I gave a missed call. I didn't get you. Who are you? Sir, I came this morning regarding your sister. Sir, I told you about my love, didn't I? What have you decided? Hey, if I come there, I'll kill you. Where are you now? He cut the line. - Who is he, brother? The mad boy who came today morning expressing love for you. How did he get my number? Saying "I want to fix a Rs.80 millions worth business deal" He got your number from watchman. How did he look like? Is it important now? No. I'll be careful if I know about him, won't I? I'm sorry. His face would've been recorded on CCTV. Show it to her... Hi... - Hi... How are you? - You how? Fine. I started liking you the moment I saw you on our TV monitor. Wow! It has worked out! What happened? Thanks. My friends said the man I love must be more brave than handsome. But you are handsome and... ...brave too... Thanks again. I've a lot to talk with you. Shall we go somewhere else? Oh sure! Great, buddy! Buddy, you trapped her within a day! Where did you go first? Thiru, they are all your friends. Hi... - Thiru from Ayanavaram. Where in Ayanavaram? Saraswathi Road, 3rd cross street. I know a Postman Palanivel there. Oh no! My house is just opposite to his house. We have come very closer. Where shall we go, beach or hotel? Let's go to the hotel first. - Why? Only then, we can play well in the beach. Yes. You should play well with us. Look, she's using double meaning. Welcome Mr. Thiru. Why did you stop here? Let's go and meet my friend SI Kiran. No... Come on, Mr. Thiru... No member of my family has ever stepped into a police station. Why? In 1978, my father got an offer to become an IGP directly. He rejected the offer to avoid entering the Police station. Even my grandpa suggested jumping over the threshold. But my father refused outrightly. After that? Why are you digging the past? Hey, why should we hear him? Lift him... - What? Oh no! Oh my God! Hey fatso! I suspected this to happen... Oh no! What happened then? SI was well known to me. He told me,"Mr. Thiru, why did you come here?". One call and I would've come myself. I said it's a love matter. Immediately he asked men to buy garlands. Why? To perform our marriage. I said, first business and then marriage. - You're right. Hey, tell only the truth. Sister... Who is sister to you? Remove your shirt. Sister, don't force. Ladies are here... Who are we then? Don't we look like ladies? Rascal, get up... get up man... Hey, what's this? Face cream, Sister. I wanted to be fairer when I propose to her. You ruined everything, Sister! Again calling me sister? If I had a brother like you, I would've killed him. If you call me 'sister', will I spare you? Oh no! Forget it. Flashbacks are never fully true. Lies will creep into flashbacks. I accept it! After the incident he wouldn't have come to your college, right? I too thought the same. But he was there before me. Priya... Hey, what do you want now? Are you sure, won't you love me? I won't. Really? Yes. Then make a phone call and tell him. Tell whom? Tell my father. Why should I inform your father? Didn't I express my love to your brother? You should tell my father you don't love me. Okay. Tell me your father's number. Okay. Priya, is this your phone number? Okay. Send me an SMS about tomorrow's meeting place. Bye... No Simran, I won't love you. Whatever you say... Oh no! You may have a car, a bungalow, 2 dogs... I can't do anything about it... Why did you cut the call and call back? What's all this? Whatever you say, I love only Priya. You're like a mosquito. How dare you love Priya? Don't you know mosquitoes won't allow us to sleep? If I tell my brother, he will sack them out, don't you know? I'll come back again and buzz you. How much ever you try, Priya won't love you. You know? I swear on you, she will definitely love me. I swear on you, I will never love him. What ever you do, I won't love you. Why? Hey, her status won't match yours. What is her status? Do you know how much she spends for a day? As a leech, you should know it better. Hey, you're talking too much... Hey, you're eating more... Priya, he is a fraud. Don't believe him. Who is fraud? Fraud? What's this? Cheat! He has insulted me. I'll take my leave. I warn you again, don't believe him. Priya, I love you. Hey, take off your hand... She won't suit you. Why? Did you see your complexion? Fair complexion is a disease. It can't bear neither cold nor summer. Is this good complexion? Go and see in Mahabalipuram. Foreigners are taking sun bathes to suntan their skin. Today is Sunday. Won't you leave me alone? No day is against love. All days are meant for love. I love you. I can't love you. - Why? Because my family is important to me. You girls are always behind your family members! All they can give you is new clothes and good care. That's all! But I'm ready to give anything you like. What can you do? I'll sacrifice my life. I'll sacrifice my life for you. Okay then. Jump here and die for me. You always mistook my words. I didn't mean like that... - Then? What I meant was... After you accept my love, we will get married. After our marriage, I'll give you a life... a child. A small family is a happy family. You, me and our child. In the future, if I die before you in old age... Our child will take care of you. This is what I meant. Now tell me, do you love me? I will never love you. Get lost! You will love me. How can you say so? Confidence. An elephant's strength is it's trunk. Hope is the strength of men. I can take any risk to win your love. Any risk? - Yes. First, get back that ring. Let's see how confident you are. Priya, I think it's very deep. Do you really want it back? That's your wish! Did you find that ring or not? Buddy, tell me, did you find it or not? No. I know that you won't get it. Now you know your confidence level? Tsunami and earthquakes are disastrous, but don't shake our faith in God. Similarly, you can't judge my love with this ring. It's fate's diktat that we should unite. How can you say that? - Yes. The day I saw you at the temple, I fell for you. When I was very eager to see you again... I met you. I was waiting for the moment I'll see you again... But it was fate. I met you on that very day. Whenever I wished to see you, I did. What do you say about that? Love should blossom on both sides. One sided love is just a dream. Stop dreaming and mind your work. Whatever you say... You will definitely fall for me. I've that confidence. Okay. If you're so confident and believe in your fate... Before tomorrow evening 5 pm, will you manage to see me? - I will. Wherever you go in this world, I'll see you. If that happens, I'll believe you. Okay? Hey Priya, he is a dangerous boy. He will definitely find you. It's impossible for him to find the place I'll be at. What is that secret place? Who is she? She is from Coimbatore. She was going to Postman Palanivel's house. He has moved out, hasn't he? - She doesn't know his new address. Her train is at 5 pm. She will wait here till then. Please sit... If you're so confident and believe in your fate... Before tomorrow evening 5 pm, will you manage to see me? How did you come here? In an auto. From Coimbatore? The dialed number is switched off. Hey... what man? Who is he? We have to go to the hospital. Come home quickly. Please mother... today you take father with you. Hey, what is it? I've an important work. It seems he has an important work. He refused to come. Is it more important than your health? Did you take the X rays? - Yes. We will go to the hospital and come. You stay here. My younger son will come now. - Okay. We will try to come back quickly. If it's time to catch the train, you carry on... okay? - Is it Thirukumaran's house? - Yes. Come immediately to Royapettah G.H. What happened? Driver, go fast. Okay. If you're so confident and believe in your fate... Before tomorrow evening 5 pm, will you manage to see me? My eyes started dreaming about you... Your footsteps are lingering in my heart... You've touched my heart... I've taken a new birth because of you... Oh dear! Is this called love? My eyes started dreaming about you... After falling in love, I've started writing poems... I avoid my friends... I want to meet only you... I feel alone even in my parents' company... If you marry me, my life becomes fruitful... Till yesterday, my home was my world... But today I would like to join in your family... From the moment I love you, I lived in your heart... My eyes started dreaming about you... In dreams, I take your photos... I consider my dreams as true... Oh maiden! I never forget you... I can think only when I forget you... You're my breath... You're my life... True love never fails... My eyes started dreaming about you... Your footsteps are lingering in my heart... You've touched my heart... I've taken a new birth because of you... Oh dear! Is this called love? I'm afraid of my brother. I fear that he may trouble you. Everything will end well, isn't it? - Definitely. Okay. Touch one finger... Don't you believe me? Please... touch one... Whether your brother accepts or not, I'll marry you. When did you find this? - That day itself. Why didn't you give it to me then? Financial problems. So I pledged the ring. You shameless... No Priya. I thought of returning it the day you accept my love. If I didn't accept it... you would've taken it. I knew you would accept my love. How did you know it? - Confidence! Thiru, anyhow you've won her love. Your marriage should take place smoothly. What happened, Priya? Does your brother know about us? Let's not talk here. Let's go somewhere else. Tell me, Priya. What happened? Nothing happened. I was really tensed... This is how you should be afraid of my brother. Wait. I'll get you an ice cream. Hey 2 cornetto. Hi... how come you are here? No college? Have you come with friends? - Yes. Where are they? They are nearby... Madam, ice cream... Sir, what would you like to have? Are you working here? You want me to believe that? Oh! Is it paining to you, if I beat her? Yes. Brother please... Brother, don't beat him... Please leave him... Brother, please... please brother, leave him... Brother, don't beat him... Please leave him... Brother please Have it. - No. Listen to me... I said no, right? You rascal, hang up the phone. Priya, what's all this? Priya has slashed her hand. I'm tensed. I'll call the doctor. You come home quickly. I didn't call you here to perform your marriage with my sister. I called you to protect my life. My sister Priya is my life. I also didn't come here for your word. I came to protect my life. My Priya is my life! Forget Priya and mind your work. She won't suit you. She will! She won't! Sir, she will suit me. We will live together. That's impossible. Sir, that's possible. - Impossible. It's possible, sir! - If it happens, I'll kill you! I'm ready to die. Hey, I'm tolerating you just because my sister loves you. You know that she loves me, don't you? Can't you agree to our marriage? No way! Please, try to understand. Why are you talking like a villain? Who is villain? I took care of her for years and wish to marry her into a good family... Am I a villain to you? A jobless poor man like you chasing her in the name of love, is a hero? Yes sir. A girl has her father's initial till her marriage. After that she uses her husband's initials. A. Kavitha becomes B. Kavitha. And C. Uma, D. Uma. Everything is possible in love! That is the power of love! You cheats lure girls with these talks. Who is cheating? Your responsibility is over after your daughter's marriage. After that it's we who look after them. That is love! Stupid love. You love and marry a girl. If there is any problem, you will leave her. Even then, it's her relations who support her. Love may break. But not the relationship! Sir, I don't know about others. But I'll take good care of Priya. - How? Will you feed her? - Sir... What 'sir'? What qualification do you have to marry my sister? Sir, what do I lack? Not handsome, no brain, no status, no money. Sir, money isn't important to love. A loving heart is more than enough. Shit! You fool, be practical. A loving heart is enough! What can you do with a loving heart? Can you buy a kilogram of rice or medicines? We need money to live. My sister prefers to dine in 5 Stars hotels. You need to work a month for one of her meals. You can sleep anywhere you like. But my sister can't sleep without an AC. You worry about what dress to go out with. But my sister worries about which car to go out with. You can't keep her happy even for an hour. I'll die, if she isn't happy. That's why I'm telling you... Please forget my sister! You could've said this to your sister. She isn't listening to me. - Then why should I? My beloved sister slashed her hand in protest. I beat you. But still you respected my word and came here. Because men are more sentimental than women. That's why I'm requesting you... I never asked anything from anyone in my life... For the first time, I request you... to forget my sister. She is my world. Try to understand my feelings and please forget her. Okay boss. I understand your feelings. Mere sentiments won't workout. If you finalize an amount, I can take my leave. What? A settlement, boss. How much do you want, tell me? The product is yours. You fix an amount. Two hundred thousands? What two hundred thousands? Do you think love is so cheap? What's this, Mr. Guru? By fixing an alarm at 5 am, waking up before it rings, silencing the alarm without disturbing others, picking a few rupees in dad's pocket, we leave on our bike, which breaks down half way, If we go to a petrol bunk and ask to fill half a liter, he will look at us cheaply. Bearing all these insults, when we come to the bus stop, a guy more handsome than me will be standing there, that will give shivers down the spine, after over taking him and getting the attention of the girl, someone else will stop you from behind. It's the police! They will book us with an eve teasing case. After facing all this, when we go after the girl, she will say 'you dog, wastrel, don't you have sisters'? She'll abuse not only me but my entire family. Without bothering about all this, we manage to find a place in her heart slowly. We make them feel we are their everything, and everyone else are nothing. The hell we go through to achieve this, even a dog will feel for us if it hears our tale. Drink water... You are tired hearing it. How will I be after narrating it? Okay. Fix a price. I'm telling you again, the product is yours. You fix the price. 2 millions...? 2.5 millions. This is the final! There're 2 counterfeit notes. Hey, did we print them? You got it by mistake. Just 2, isn't it? It's okay if it's false love, but mine is true. Uncle, give me Rs.100. - Why? For auto fare. - What? This isn't included in the account. Give me... Take it. You won't trouble me again in the name of love, will you? Till now, I respected love. Hereafter, I will respect money. Bye! Don't insult your brother by writing with a tiny pencil. Take Rs.1000. Buy pencils. - Take Rs.500. - For what? You will make mistakes. Buy erasers. Daddy, brother has a lot of money. What? Father is not able to sell a piece of land, isn't he? I'll buy that land. Ask him the price. - What do you mean? - I'm the telling the truth. If you don't believe me, look at this. Rs.2.5 millions. Where did you get this money? Tell him. Ask him where he stole it? Feel happy that I have made this much money. Do not doubt me. Swear on your mother and tell me how did you get this money? Swear on me! Yes, he has stolen it from somewhere. No, I didn't steal. I know the pain one has to go through to earn a penny. Where did you get this much money? - Tell me I say. - Please tell him. I'll tell you. You know that I was in love. Her brother called me and gave me Rs.2.5 millions to forget his sister. Between love and money, I felt money was more important. So, I took the money. Till now, I thought that you are not responsible enough. But now, I feel that you have no heart. How could you trade a girl's love for money? You will never come up in life. Go away! Take all your money and get out. Money is very important in life. It applies to you and not to us. Do you know what I'm going to do with this money... Don't say anything. First get out. Till now father used to say this. Now you have also joined him. I will go. I thought of starting a new business from our house. That will not happen. If you need money, ask me. If you feel shy to ask me in person, call me. My phone is 9884062004. I'll bring lunch to your school. Where are you going, Priya? The doctor told you to take rest. I'm going to meet Thiru. - He won't meet you if you go now. - Why? Tell me. You can't bear the truth. He loves your money and not you. What are you saying? He traded with your brother and exchanged your love with money. - Did brother asked you to say this? - No. I won't trust you. Priya, Muthukrishnan is right. I'm sure that he wouldn't have traded my love with money. I trust him. I gave him the money. Won't you believe me? No way. Will you believe if he says it? - No Priya. - But my brother told me. Yes, he proposed it. 'I'll give you money, forget about my sister'. I rejected his offer. While I was leaving, he even gave me Rs.100 to catch an auto. But I took nothing. So, you didn't take his money. - Do you believe me? - Thiru... It's fine for your brother to accuse me. But when you suspect me, I can't bear it. Love is like a tree. Money is like the wind. When the wind blows, the tree will shake. But it will never go with the wind. This is not only true for your brother but also for the entire world, money can't buy love. - Do you trust me? - Yes. I'm scared of my brother. How will you handle him? I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... I wonder what is going to happen... I wonder what would be the end... I'm in troubles... I've lost my sleep... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... I wonder what is going to happen... I wonder what would be the end... I'm in troubles... I've lost my sleep... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... Your brother tortures me like Hitler... He is very affectionate to me... I'm his life, know that? And you won't understand that either... Tell me, sweetheart... If you don't tell me, I won't talk to you... If a speck gets into my eyes, he would stop the wind from blowing... Even if a thorn pricks me, he would burn down the entire forest... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... Love is a fort... Once your break the doors, it's your hunting ground... Let's go inside... Will hunger hit us? I'm an iron man... It's fun till dawn... No, my darling... If my brother sees us, he will kill you... Is your brother a don? Why is he against love? If you tries to hurt me, I will cut his throat... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... I wonder what is going to happen... I wonder what would be the end... I'm in troubles... I've lost my sleep... I saw you accidentally... I fell for you knowingly... Now you know that he is a fraud? I'm ashamed to come to this house. - What did he say? - He said the truth. What truth? He said he didn't take money from you. Scoundrel! He lied to you. If anyone speaks bad about Thiru, I will die. Ask him to come here. Hello... come here immediately. It would take a week... I will rip you apart. I will talk to him. Why didn't you accept that you took money from him? What are you talking about? - I'll kill you. I said I will handle him. - Do you love his sister? - Yes. - Did he tell you to forget her? - Yes, he did. - What did you ask in return? - Money. - How much? - Rs.2.5 millions. - Did he give you? - Yes he did. After accepting the money, what did you tell her? I said I didn't take money from him. I said I will talk to him, right. - Did you come to the terrace? - Yes, I did. What did he say? He asked me to forget his sister. - What did you ask in return? - Money. - How much did he give you? - Rs.2.5 millions. After accepting the money, what did you tell her? I said I didn't take his money. You took money saying that you'll forget her. Then why did you lie to my sister that you never took any money from me? I took money from you saying that I will forget her. It would cost you more to say this to your sister. How much? I'm telling you again, it is you who should decide. - Rs.1 million. - Very happy. Rs.100 for you. For what? To catch an auto. Sorry. I've bought a car. Bye brother-in-law. Good morning, sir. Thiru, Priya has come. She is waiting for you. - Hi Priya... - Hi... Again you are... Just a minute... I'll finish my prayer. Tell me Priya... My brother told me that you took money from him. But I don't think so. Why do you always trust others' words? Why don't you believe your brother's words? So you accept that you've taken money. I've seen you hiding and watching us. Are you acting smart with me? I was a great shakes as an actor in primary school itself. I got thunderous applause. Even our English teacher praised my performance. Why did you love me then? Your brother threatened to kill me. Think for a while... Without accepting money, if I had talked highly about our love... He would've paid two hundred thousand to someone else and got me killed. Why others? If he pays my father just two thousand, He will surely kill me. My side is very weak. Priya, if I die, how long will you cry for me? For a month? 2 months? After that...? Your brother will send you to America to change your mind. What will you do then? You will forget our country. When you can easily forget our motherland, it won't take much time to forget me! You're the one who sold our love and you're saying that? I got a good price, I sold it. What else do you want me to do? I don't know how to fight. Didn't you tell me that our love is like a tree... ...and it will stand forever? The wind won't do anything, but a typhoon will make it fall. Finally, what have you decided? Generally girls tell boys, to find a good girl and marry. Now I'm breaking it. You marry a good man. What's this, Priya? Oh no! Where is the Bank of Baroda? - Don't know, sir. No 52, Thirumalaiappan road...? Go straight and turn left... Okay thanks. What's this, Thiru...? I've given you the check but there is no bank here. This bank doesn't exist anymore. Like your love! Till now you have seen duplicate checks. But now, the bank itself is a false one. Hey, we have given you a duplicate check. Are you bargaining with my sister's love? Do you want me to shell out your demand? That is okay. Didn't he ask for auto fare too? That was the height of his arrogance. Are you blackmailing me? Hey, I'm a born business man. You know only to solve problems. But I'm a master in creating them. You bean pole! Showing your antics on me? Stop it with this. Or else I'll bury you here. Hey, I may look like a high class man. But if I stoop down I'm a worse rogue than you. Sir, Collector is on the line. Excuse me... Yes sir... Oh my beloved... oh my darling... Who are you, sir? - Can't you recognize my voice? Hey you wastrel! Is this the time to call me? I'm sorry. Guru sir, don't get emotional... I would've replied to you there itself. But you may be carrying a gun. If you had shot me in tension, I would've died in slow motion. That's why I left silently. What do you want? Guru sir, I've many photos with your sister. photographed with glamour... What do you mean? You pay the amount you were supposed to and take the photos. If I don't pay you...? 'Guru's sister is in love with Thiru Mr Guru is in depression.' If I pass this news on the Internet... You will go mad! After that you can't find anyone in this world to marry your sister. Where do we meet? At the Bank of Lies. Didn't get me? At the same place! Hi, darling... Did you wait long? We just arrived. Had I known I would've come half an hour later. What did you say? Am I a bean pole? I agree with you. But everyone else have only 1.4 kilograms of brain. I've 1.5 kilograms of brain! You will issue a fake check, and if I question you, you will say it's a game. If the listener is stupid, you will say any nonsense to him, won't you? What did you tell me? Are you a master in creating problems? Guru sir, your problems can't be solved. First we should analyze the problem, Only then we can solve it. Hey, give me the photos. Give the money. Check the amount. This time, I don't think you will take any risk with your sister's matter. Here are the photos and negatives. Check it out. See you! What did you say? Is your brain 1.5 kilograms? It will get blown up. Keep the suitcase down and leave that car you bought with my money, catch a share auto and run away. Boss, he shouldn't live. Shoot him... Why are you laughing now? I knew you would react like this. So, before coming here, I've filed a complaint to the Commissioner. If anything happens to me... The very next day, the police will come for you. What? - Your name is topping the list. I'm just an assistant. Don't take my words seriously. Put down your gun... While you take care of your sister's life, he may end mine. Duplicate copy of the complaint. Guru sir, you may be a worse rogue than me if you stoop down. But I'm a born rogue! Bye! People welcome Dr. Karunanidhi's Rs.2 a kg rice scheme. What's this? He gave us a newspaper saying it's a police complaint. Come on... place this stone here... May your business flourish well. Pray well. Today we are going to meet Mr Thiru, who is an upcoming businessman. Hello Mr Thiru... - Hello. How are you? - I'm fine. Mr Thiru, you're a leading businessman at this young age... How did you achieve this? Generally people like visiting places around the world. But I wished to be an all-rounder. - Stop it man! I'll definitely achieve my goal. Is there any particular reason for this tremendous growth? Normally, people wish to get their salaries promptly. But I wished to be a owner. Heard him? According to me, hard work and sincerity will pay you. Oh my God! For youngsters, give us tips on how to succeed in business. - I thought about it...and you asked. - Tell me. Don't desire others' money. Can you explain this? Why should we desire others' money? Hi dear, how are you? Hi darling, I'm fine... Hi dear, how are you? Hi darling, I'm fine... I look like a small boy... But I'm the key to your lock... You're a good citizen... You're a duplicate key to my lock... Hi dear, how are you? Hi darling, I'm fine... I'm a multimillionaire... Hey you bony, what do you own? You've a beautiful sister... And I'm lucky to be her husband... Don't compete with me with sentiments... I'll win and give you a hot news... You can't win over me... I won't get defeated... Ant can trouble an elephant entering it's ears... Hi dear, how are you? If I wish, I can buy the heaven... A wastrel, nothing is possible for you... Your wealth can buy heaven... My brain can create heaven... Your wrong intention will pull you down... My will power will win over you... Cheats fail... they can't win... I'll win you and marry your sister... Hi dear, how are you? Hi darling, I'm fine... Hi dear, how are you? Hi darling, I'm fine... I look like a small boy... But I'm the key to your lock... You're a good citizen... You're a duplicate key to my lock... Hi dear, how are you? - Hi darling, I'm fine... You were listening to the song from the film Mr. Bharath. You were listening to the program, "Small boss and Big boss". Thanks sir. Happy Diwali, sir. Thanks. Thanks, buddy. - No thanks in friendship. I'm very happy, buddy. Last year, we craved for this. Now we have reached this level and are helping others. Okay then. I'll take my leave. Tomorrow don't forget to come to my house. - Bye... Tomorrow your lunch is in my house. You should come definitely. I will surely. - Okay. Are you fine? - Yes. Are you fine? - How about you? - I'm fine. Welcome mother... take it. - Greetings, dear. How are you? I'm fine. I was very much worried about him. But now I'm peaceful. Tomorrow you should definitely come to my house. - I will. - See you... - Okay. Why are you bursting sparklers like a girl? Fire crackers. Don't get scared... Hi Urmila... Happy Diwali. - Same to you. Concentrate here... Why are you so afraid? Me? Not at all! He won't listen to us. Father, light it... mother, light it... Why are you getting scared? Father, come on... what's this, dad? Watch now... how is it? Open it and give it to him. Hey, fire them one by one... Light this one... Hubby... Brother... Why did you come inside? If I stay there for few more minute. I fear I might call him in. That's why... Shall I give him the new clothes which we bought for him? Give him. But refuse to take anything from him. Mother, brother left. Brother gave me this shirt. He asked me to wear it inside without father's knowledge. Brother asked me to give these bangles to you. There's a land on auction at Sholinganallur for unpaid loans. If we buy the land, we can start a mineral water factory there. I heard that the ground water is good. Let's buy it. We can. But we'll have competitors. How many? Many builders like Arihant, Ceebros and Salim's are coming. When they learn we're interested... They will hold back. Don't bother. Sir, no one has come to compete with us. Greetings, Muthukrishnan. Are you fine? Are your family members fine? Sir, I'm in no way connected to him. He plans to break our relationship. I would've lost my job. Mr. Chandramohan, owner of 8 acres of land in Sholinganallur. His land is on auction for unpaid bank loans. The auction begins at 3.5 millions. Interested candidates can bid. 4 millions... 5 millions... 6 millions... 7.5 millions... 7.5 millions! 7.5 millions once... twice... thrice. Muthukrishnan, see you then. Hey, I've lost 2.5 millions in this auction. Still I've won against you. That was my business plan. Business? Guru sir... I'm the cheat who sold bus tickets in the black market. You've lost your 2.5 millions with your pride. But I've gained 2.5 millions with my silence. - How? The land you bought is my father's land which remained unsold for a long time. Look there... The man who is signing there happily is my father. 2.5 millions is fine to us? My dad tried a lot to sell that land for a long time. I spread rumors about the good ground water. You should've understood finding no one here... I swear, my aim was not to trap you in this... I was directed to anyone... But you voluntarily walked into it. What I did was a plan. What happened to you is fate. Bye, dear! - Good morning sir. - Good morning. Hello, may I speak to Mr Thiru? Yes, Mr Guru... Good! You recognized my voice. If I fail to do this... at this young age... How can I become a big industrialist? - You'll pay for it now. - I didn't get you. I agree that you've become a big industrialist. But a big industrialist has to face many problems. I don't know how you're going to manage it. What man? No reply? I will spare 10 minutes of my day for you. Didn't get me? Hereafter, you won't understand anything. You might've seen my anger... you might've seen my style... But you haven't seen my game, right? This is known as Guru's game. I'm going to win sitting in my office. Turn to your right and see... We are from the Income Tax department. We want to search your place. Guru sir, I'm Thiru here... What? Got scared? Sir, please help me... Those men would've spoken to you in English. How did you manage them? Mr. Thiru, we have fully searched your office. Your construction, real estates, departmental stores, exports... You've good records of accounts. But we want to know the source for this business. How did you get money? You don't have evidence of any bank loan. Then how is it possible? Come on tell us... - Please come out... - Speak out... Reply please... Tell me, where's the proof? Only my boss can answer you. Who is your boss? My boss! Sincere, dedicated and lucky man! Hey... Buddy, what you played was just a game. But I've played with your fate. Didn't you say that you will win against me sitting in your office? But I'll sit after winning against you! Didn't you ask me to turn right? Now you turn left and see... Mr Thirukumaran pointed you as his boss. It seems he is looking after your business. Is it true? I don't know who he is. I'm in no way connected with him. He is running his business in your name. We have all the records. Sir, there are many Gurus. How can I be responsible for it? He is worshiping your photo. Tea shops display actress Trisha's photos. Does it mean she owns them? Is the photo the matter? I'm in no way connected to him. Did you inform him that his office was going to be raided? - No sir. Did Thiru inform you that we were going to come here? - No sir. Then, give me your cell. - Oh no! Yes sir. What's this? You both are answering differently. That's... his sister's love affair... Sir, that is a different issue. What is that? Tell me... That is personal. Please... Okay. That is personal. Now answer me. Did you give money to Thiru? Yes sir. Oh my God! No sir... Again answering differently? - Sir, that is... Yes sir. We gave him. Why? How much? - That is... - Do you have the record? Yes that is... - Tell me... It's a taxable income. - Please answer... Come on tell me sir... tell the truth... Why did you give him? I just gave him money to develop his business. Who will pay tax for that amount? - I'll pay the tax for it. Okay then... problem is solved. - Thanks for the cooperation. - Yeah. Thank you. Hey, pay the tax. Sir, people won't pay the tax for their own income. But you're paying taxes on others' income. Do what I say, man! You will never spend for me! I've been with you since morning, bunking college. Why do you want to go there? Better stay with me. You always want to leave early. Okay. My family will search for me. I'll take my leave now. Just a minute... Why? It may rain. You shouldn't get drenched. - Take it. - Joking? It's hot. How will it rain? It's impossible. - It will rain. It won't... I'll take my leave. How did you know? - I knew! Tell me, how did you guess it? They announced it on TV. - That it will rain? No. That it won't. I'm from Madurai... I'm a lucky man... I'm a beauty from Pattukottai... If you come near me, I won't spare you... Hey sexy lake... Can I row my boat in your lake? Don't blabber... You're going to get it from me... I'm a 'Yes man' to you... If you say 'yes', I'll become your husband... Don't show off to me... I won't marry you... I'm from Madurai... I'm a lucky man... I'm a beauty from Pattukottai...

If you come near me, I won't spare you... Come to me, I'm ready to marry you... If you marry me, I won't stop you... I'll give myself to you... Is it scientifically developed body?

He's a doctor in America. He earns 0.4 millions a month. - Next? Sir, he's Rahul. He's from London. I've only one sister. Look for a groom who is near to me. Sir, look at this one... People are saying he's the next Ambani. Sir, his name is Thiru. He is an upcoming Industrialist. But I don't know where he got his money from! - We know it. He is a master in business. - He will be! I'll accept any man other than him for my sister. Fix that American groom. Music band from Tanjore. Betel leaves from Kumbakonam. Food from Chettinad. Jasmine from Madurai. And Halwa from Thirunelveli. We couldn't get a groom in India. But we found one in America. Congratulations. He is congratulating you. First, let the marriage get over. Then I will teach you a lesson. See whether the marriage gets done or not. Threatening me...? Wait and see. What? Wait...and...see. Priya... - What's the matter? I've finalized a boy for Priya. The marriage is very soon. Priya... here... Brother... - What happened, dear? - I didn't tell you something. - What is it? The day I accepted his love, we got married at the registrar's office. Sign here Priya. Why didn't you say this before? Do not tell your brother about our marriage till I ask you. Why? He might create unnecessary problems. That's why... - Okay I won't tell him. Promise. Your brother is my God. Swear on him. I promise. I swore on you. I hid the truth to keep the promise. What else can happen after this? Shall I arrange the money? - For what? He makes mountain out of a mole hill. Now he has a mountain. Call him. The number you've dialed is switched off. The phone dialed is again switched off. Will the cell phone company greet the callers with the caller's name? - Where is his office? - In Mount road. What? - Checking. Sir... Remove your clothes. For what? - I hear a beep sound. It's coming from your cell phone. Hello... Where is he? Find where he is. Hey... Welcome Mr. Idiot. What's here that needs a fan? The the fan's inventor will commit suicide if he sees this. Why are you so tensed? You cheated my sister into marriage. We love each other, so we got married. I spared your life because of my sister. Her marriage is due next week. Give me the registered marriage documents and evidences and sign here that you're ready to divorce Priya willingly. I can't. Sign here I say. - I can't. Sign. - No, I can't. I said sign here. Sign. Sign. Marriage certificate. Have I done anything that you don't like? I built this house to your taste. I married the girl you liked. I always do the things you like. Then, why don't you understand my feelings? Your brother has never begged anyone. But I know how many insults he had to bear for you. Even your parents wouldn't have been so affectionate to you. You must forget him. It's not my decision. It's Thiru's decision. Your marriage certificate. Divorce papers signed by him. - Hello. - It's me Priya. - How are you? - Don't talk. Just listen to me... If you say anything, I'll hang up. I have been crying all day. Do you know why? Not because I fell in love. But for falling in love with a wrong guy like you. I thought you would reform some day. But the moment you gave away our marriage certificate and handed over divorce papers... Please listen to me. From now on, there is nothing between us. I'll marry my brother's choice. It will take a month. No way. I don't care about the cost, but do it in 1 week. I will try, sir. Don't try. Do it. Okay sir. I'm very happy that Priya has accepted this marriage. He shouldn't create any problem in my sister's marriage. Remove the original certificates in Registrar's office. No marriage was registered on the 24th. It did. That's the date on the certificate. Take a good look. What seal is this! The seal says "Saravana Stores, T. Nagar". What? "Saravana stores, Ranganathan street". The marriage certificate is a fake. What? The marriage certificate is a fake. What? It's a seal of Saravana Stores. Saravana Stores...? "Sparkling and magnificent..." Shut up. What should I do now? He has given us a fake marriage certificate. He will do anything. I've done many things for my sister. Just a murder. - Sir... - No Muthu Krishnan. He is a criminal. He won't let me live in peace. He must die before Priya's marriage. No. My sister's life is important to me. Kill him. Get out. - Get out. - Listen to me. Listen to what? Get out. - Sir, please... - Get out I say. I have smashed your men. Beating you is not a big thing. What? You thought you'll reveal everything and stop the marriage? I didn't hide anything when I arranged this marriage. I won't let this marriage happen. You took my money saying that you'll have no relation with her. Then, why are you here? I took the money not to leave Priya. But to succeed in my love. You're the one who said that... To marry your sister one should have a car, a bungalow and fame. Now I have all that. You should've gotten it with hard earned money. I didn't have money. Even I wanted to become a big business man. I had the skill to earn. But no one gave me a chance to show my skills. You can't become Sachin, if you don't get an opportunity. I asked my father to give me money to start a business. He was ready to invest on land but not on me. I approached the bank for a loan. They wanted a guarantor, some surety or a property. Where would I go for all these? Loan are given on cows but not on humans. I even approached a pawn broker. There I found out that a gold ring has more value than educated youngsters. I fell in love with your sister. You weren't concerned about my character, skill or if I can look after your sister. You wanted me to be settled in life. If people marry only those who have settled in life, no one can marry in their 20's. Marry only at the age of 60. You can only go for a walk with her but not live with her. What did you say the other day? I need one month's salary to feed one meal to your sister. Today, my one day's earning can meet her one month's expenses. Even I wanted to come up in life and then marry your sister. But I'm not an heir to riches. My love was my only wealth. I pledged my love and took money from you. I've earned a lot from that money. Take your money. Return my love. I may have taken the wrong path. But I've made money in a honest way. I'm constructing a house for Priya. Once the construction is over, I thought of telling you the truth and take Priya with me. I'll take very good care of your sister. Your permission is more important to me than Priya's. If you still don't trust me... You made me sign the divorce papers by force. I will do it voluntarily. Stop. I don't like you. I don't like your personality and activities. But I like you as a talented businessman. You could've taken her away on the day you married her. But you wanted my permission for that. I like your sentiment. If it was someone else, he would've taken the money and spent it on drinks. But with a will to win, you've succeeded in business. I admire your love. You wanted to take better care of her than me. I like that character in you. My brother might have accepted you. But I won't. Have you both ever thought about me? Love is not something to be pledged. I did all this to keep you happy and give you a comfortable life. Did I ask you for a car or a bungalow? I loved you knowing that you had none of these. We don't need these to fall in love. But after marriage, we tend to want them. No use brooding then. Let's brood now and be happy later. I wanted to see you only after succeeding in life. That's why I didn't tell you either. Still, what you did was wrong. Yes, it is wrong. Forgive me. Do you know how much I've cried, missing you? From now on you'll be missing me and cry. You are saying that in anger. You still love me. - No. But I still love you. If you don't love me anymore... Marry him. I'll be the luckiest man in the world... to be able to see my wife marry someone else! I'll be watching. Do you have a brother? - No. I'm Thiru. I'm Angayarkanni. It's okay. Hey! You scoundrel! Rascal. Trying to tease me? You're pulling my leg? I'll show you! Take this! But you were ready to marry him. I wasn't going to! I was pulling your leg! Me too... I was pulling your leg. Give me money. You were like a good boy till now. Asking him for money now? Just give me one rupee. You're bringing me luck. What can you do with one rupee? He'll outshine Ambani with 50 pennies. What a question! Sir will do it... sir! I can buy the world. But how? Confidence, boss. Confidence!
