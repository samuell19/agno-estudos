Get up. You! Get away from me or I swear I'll tell everyone what I know. Not part of the plan. I'm going to be a mother. A really good mother. You will be an awful mother! Nobody's even come looking for you. Nobody cares if you're alive or dead! If you're gonna kill me, just do it! What a good idea! ♪ ♪ So who're you dating now? Uh, do you remember Rob? Rob? Yeah. Really? Bartender Rob? Again, yeah. I thought that was like, after what he did... I know, but he's just so hot. This is so good. Did you know women who eat chocolate have babies that smile more often? Oh, I've been on it. Trust me, I have been on it. My baby is smiling so hard from the chocolate that her face hurts. Good. To our little baby Jillian. To Jillian. So how are your checkups? I have another one today, but at the last one the doctor said everything looks perfect. Perfect is good. We like perfect. We do, it's just... it's hard not to think about what happened last time and not be scared. I know, sweetie. Oh wait! I almost forgot. You have two baby shower themes to choose from. Butterflies? Or... construction equipment! You do know she's a girl? Yes, but I know my goddaughter won't conform to gender norms. Butterflies it is. Yes. Boring. Moms are boring, apparently. Hey Emily. You're up. Hospital pre-registration. Better to fill this out now, otherwise you'll be trying to remember your social security number while you're having contractions. Not fun. It's just the normal stats. Contacts, doctor's name. This isn't your first pregnancy. I didn't mean that. That's not what I meant, I know it's not. It's okay, it's fine. Is the doctor ready for me? Yes, room 1. Pam, you idiot! Hey Pete, it's me. I'm in the exam room. I guess you're not gonna make it to the appointment. Emily? Hey. How you doing? Good. Good. How's that baby moving? She has a future as a Rockette. Well, let's take a listen. 142 beats a minute. It's perfect. And how about you? How are you doing? Keeping up with your antidepressants and prenatals? Yes, I am. What is it? I've been exercising. I've been taking all of my pills. I've been reading blog after blog about prenatal health and... You need to give yourself a break, okay? Pregnancy after losing a baby is traumatic. Always. You gotta trust in yourself. Your body is nourishing your baby just as it should and everything is perfect. Hey! Stop worrying. Kep taking your meds. All right? Okay. See you soon. Okay, I need you to push hard. Push! Push! Push! Em, I'm home! There you are. How are my two favorite girls? I got these for you. I'm so sorry. It was a total client nightmare. Calling him the client from hell would be accurate but unfair to hell. I really am sorry. I promise I'll be by your side from here on out. It's okay. I've been thinking... maybe I should cancel my baby shower. Why? I just feel like people are gonna be annoyed that they already got me a gift and they'll be whispering behind my back and treating me like a delicate porcelain doll. Okay, but having a baby shower won't jinx anything. And neither will decorating the baby's room. Baby Jillian is gonna need blankets and booties. Little pink frilly dresses. And your friends are desperate to buy you that stuff. It sounds like a win-win. You're right. Oh my gosh, for once you're right, Pete. You know someone's moving into old Lady Johnson's house? Did she die? We can only hope. Peter! You want to take a look? Let's do it. Okay. How come I've never seen a for sale sign? No way! She's like eight months along. We should go introduce ourselves. No, not me. You and your ice breaker. Hi! Hi! My name's Emily. My husband Peter and I live right across the street. Oh my god, you are just as pregnant as I am! That's so cool. I'm Kelly. Hi! I brought cookies. Here, come on. Come in. You look so familiar. So do you. Wait, did you go to Dr. Rodman? Yeah, I did. Awhile ago. That's such a small world. I haven't seen you there lately. Yeah no, my husband always really wanted a hospital birth, I wanted something more holistic. I'm actually training for a home birth. Really? Yeah, I transferred to a birthing center right after the divorce. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no no no. Don't be. This happened afterwards. In vitro. Two years of treatments. It's my miracle baby. My marriage may have ended but there is no way in hell that I was not going to be a mother. Good for you. I'll be right back. Umm, there should be teaspoons in the box just behind you, to your left. I see you found my kit. It's... My midwife, she wants me to be prepared for every situation. Have a birthing plan and a backup plan. Know the nearest hospital is. You know, all that. Just in case. You're brave. Our bodies are made to do this. Do you have any other kids? No. Well, no this is my first child. I'm sorry. Did I hit a nerve? No - it's not your fault. It's just that my first pregnancy ended in stillbirth. Emily... His name was Samuel. I'm so sorry. It's okay. No. No it's not. That's your baby. I don't know how you're being so strong, I would be a wreck. The truth is I am kind of a wreck. If ever you need anything... Thank you. Let's take a picture. I mean, we're belly buddies now. We have to look out for each other. That's a great idea. Smile. Text that to me? Put in your number. It's cute. Oh nice, you started dinner! It's the least I could do. So, how was it? I like her. Did you know she's having that baby all on her own? No man involved. Who needs men? That's what I was thinking. Look. Cute. What? Nothing, I'm just glad you made a new friend. I love you. I love you. Whatever it is, I hope it isn't catching. Susan, this is Kelly. Kelly, Susan. Hi. We're here to help. Really? You are a lifesaver. Here, come on in. Oh man, it still smells like creepy old lady Johnson. What a piece of work, right? What a bitch. She was my aunt. Oh. But umm... she was a great neighbor. Yeah, the best. No no. I know Aunt Sheila was really mean. But she and my mom were really close, so when she died, she left the house and the car and all the furniture. I thought this would be a really great fresh start for me and my baby. Yeah. So where should we start? Well those boxes can go out to the garage. But please nobody open the basement door. My cat is not adjusting very well. She's kind of a psycho. She even scratched me. Oh, I love cats. Ow, ow! You okay? Ow! I don't know, I just felt a sharp stabbing pain right here. Oh God... Hey, Emily. You're okay. Your baby is okay. You're just having a little bit of a contraction, all right? So, breathe in through your nose. One, two, three... Look, maybe we should call 911. She just needs to breathe. Emily, stay with me. Breath out through your mouth. One, two, three, four, five. Em, you okay? She's fine. Yeah, that feels better. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I want to invite Kelly to the baby shower. The invitations have already been sent out. Don't you think she's nice? Yeah, sure she's nice. Super nice. You know how I feel about nice. I will never let her replace you. No one could replace me, ever. That's, that's very true. To best friends. They know the worst of each other. But refuse to believe it. Wakey, wakey Mrs. Johnson. Get away from me or I swear I will... What? Scratch me again? Eat your dinner. It's gonna get cold soon. If you're going to kill me, just do it. I hope you lose your baby. How sweet. Kelly. Hey. My mother always said never bring back a plate without something sweet on it. Thank you. You okay? Oh, yeah I've just... I've been writing for hours. I could use a break. Are you sure? Come on in. So you're a writer? Yeah, I used to work with Peter and Susan at the firm, but I always wanted to write non-fiction. So one day I quit my job and here we are. What are you writing? My story. Samuel's and mine. It's a memoir. That's intense. Yeah. To be honest, I'm not making much progress. What about you? You said you work downtown? Police dispatch. I used to be. I took a leave of absence. So many of our calls had to do with mistreatment of children and after I got pregnant, that was really hard. So after my aunt died and I inherited the house, I took that as a sign that I was supposed to birth my child into a calm and tranquil environment. That's great. Good for you. So, Susan and your husband work together? Jones and Moore. They've been partners for over five years now. I used to be a Jones there. Does it ever bother you, your husband working with such a beautiful woman? I trust him. And she's my best friend. Do you have any milk? Oh of course. That is a beautiful vase. Oh yeah. We got it on our honeymoon in Belize. Emily... Oh my god. You're bleeding. We've got to get you to the hospital. Where are your keys? Keep breathing Em I got you, okay? Oh please be okay. Oh my god, we have to call Peter. Are you contracting? No, but there was blood. Don't worry we'll get you right in. Is my baby okay? Can you tell her anything? Please relax and the doctor will be with you shortly. No, I need to know about my baby now. You'll have to ask the doctor. It's okay. Emily! Peter? How's the baby? There was blood, but they won't tell me anything. Let's just wait for the doctor. Just relax. Okay. Hi, I'm Dr. Gardner. Baby's vitals are good. But I'd like to do an exam just to make sure. That's odd. There's no sign of blood. What? There's no blood. No, there was blood. Where are my pants? We can show them. Kelly, tell them. You saw the blood on the chair. It all happened so fast. I... I know that I saw something red, I can't be sure what it was. I'll give you guys some privacy. Well, everything looks good now. You can go home. You're sure? The baby's vitals are great. There's nothing to worry about. They said everything's okay. This is a good thing. We need you to step outside to sign some papers. Okay, I'll be right back. Okay. Oh thank god. Mr. Jones, I saw in the case notes that Emily suffered from depressive psychosis after the loss of your baby three years ago. But what were her symptoms? She was irritable. Hardly ate, didn't drink, couldn't sleep. She started having bizarre thoughts. She accused me and her best friend of having an affair. Dr. Gardner nods. And then one day she just disappeared. Well, with depressive psychosis recurrence is common. Especially during times of stress. And we don't want Emily's paranoia to harm her or the baby. Paranoia? I don't think... Mr. Jones, that blood did not come from her uterus, if it was even blood. Then this doesn't make sense. Everything was going so well. Self-sabotage is a common way to manage anxiety. Look, I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. But you need to keep a close eye on her. Make sure she's eating right. Sleeping. Maybe have her meds adjusted. Peter! Do you have a minute? Sure. I'm worried about Emily. She really freaked out. I tried to tell her everything was okay, but she wouldn't listen. I just thought that you should know. Look, I know that you guys went through this huge tragedy, but everything is different this time. Emily is healthy and your baby is healthy and... I'm here. And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure things stay that way. Thank you. Hey, I got you some water. You hungry? You want some food? You know I was thinking, maybe we ought to see Dr. Miller again. You think I'm crazy? No, just... it's been awhile since you had your dose evaluated. I'm fine. Please. What happened at the hospital... that scared me. You sounded like last time. That is not fair. Hon... I know that you think I'm losing it, but I saw blood! Okay. Mommy loves you. Rock a bye baby on the treetop, when the wind blows, the cradle will rock. Peter? When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. Turn it off! Mommy loves you. Turn it off! You know, I knew him better than you. He was inside of me for nine months. Alive, moving. And then he was just... gone. You know you're the strongest woman I know. And the bravest too. And at thend of thi, we'll have a beautiful baby girl. I promise. You can't promise that. Nobody can. You're right, I can't promise that. But I promise that I'll fight for you and I'll fight for us. And if I have to, I will drag you to that therapist because I'm not giving up. I will never give up. Okay. I'll go. Thank you. Hi Susan. Yeah, I really need to talk. I think Emily's losing it again and I don't know what to do. You must have heard about what happened. I'll tell you more at work. I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you for helping me. Oh of course. Oh you have something right there. Hey hon, how was the appointment? Well, it's official. Still crazy. You're not crazy. What did the therapist say? She said it could be anything from pregnancy hormones to stress, anxiety. Take your pick. The point is I'm still losing it. Well, I should get to that finance meeting. I'll come over later for tea. Well, wine for me. Tea for you. See you. Bye. Get you a cup of chamomile? Sure. Oh Susan. Hi! Kelly. We just can't get rid of you, can we? I can leave. Maybe come back later? No, no. Please. Enter at your own risk. Surprise! I wanted to see how you're feeling. And I brought you a little peace offering. Open it. It's a Doppler. So you can listen to your baby's heartbeat. You can check on her whenever you want. Thank you. Emily... I just want to say I'm really sorry that I didn't back you up better at the hospital. I was so upset and I was so scared. I... I don't want this to affect our friendship. It's okay. Forgiven. Maybe... I could go see your nursery? I just... I could really use a little inspiration. Sure. Here it is. Going for a minimalist feel? I think you need more inspiration than I do. You might be right. But a baby's room is for hopes and dreams and right now I don't feel safe to be hopeful. It's okay. Look... what you need is a fresh start from top to bottom. Maybe you should even consider giving birth someplace new, like at home. Like me. A home birth? Seriously? You really want to add more stress to this Emily's life? No, no way. That's not happening! Susan... What? Everybody knows that home births, they're dangerous. And I hear you, but... giving birth at home is the only place that you can really let go of fear and just trust yourself. This is absurd. Giving birth should be this spiritually transformative experience. And I can help you through this, Em. I'll take real doctors and real drugs any day. Okay look, it's a lovely idea, really. But Susan is right. It's not for me, it's too risky. I totally understand. To each their own. Look, I should probably go. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. You didn't, Kelly. No no no. It's okay, I'm gonna see myself out. What the hell are you doing? Look this isn't personal, Sheila. But your neighbor is having a baby, and that baby is mine. I'm going to be a mother. A really good mother. You are gonna be an awful mother. You're just a nasty bitch. Nobody has even come looking for you. Nobody cares if you're alive or if you're dead. Well I'd rather be dead than look at you for another second! What a good idea! Why put off for tomorrow what you can do today? I'll take real drugs from real doctors any day! Oh you're right Susan! Home births are dangerous. Hey. Hey Em, sorry that cat is still giving me a really hard time. Um, sorry to bother you. You just left so quickly, I wanted to make sure everything is okay. Oh, yeah. No, everything's fine, I just... hot flashes. Yeah, been there. Look, I want you to know I totally admire your decision to take control of your birth. But given my history, I really want access to high-tech care. I totally understand and I'm so sorry if I seemed a little sensitive. All these hormones are raging out of control. Well, I just wanted to make sure we were good. We're good. Great. And I wanted to see if you could help me figure out how to use this. I would love to, but can we do it another time? I'm just headed out. Oh, yeah sure. All right, I'll see you later. Bye. Bye. It's time for some fun. One easy trick is to decorate your nursery in the theme of your baby shower. So... what's your theme? I'm sorry, what? The theme for your shower. Butterflies. Butterflies... What? This baby deserves something special. Something unique. So how about flamingoes? Coral and aqua, they're such beautiful colors. I do like coral. Okay, then it's settled. I'm going to go to the store. I'm going to pick up stencils and more paint. Promise you won't change your mind? Yes, I won't. Okay. Flamingoes! When does Peter usually come home? Around 7 or 8. Wow. What? Nothing. I just can't help think how jealous I'd be if my husband spent so much time with another woman. And umm... What? Nevermind, I'm sure it's nothing. Tell me. I saw them come home together the other day when you were at your doctor's appointment and I just couldn't help but notice how cozy they were. Does Susan always hang on Peter's arm when they're together? I don't know. Anyways, all that will change after the baby's born. It's not like Peter can spend all his time with Susan. Even if he is having fun. Susan! Where are you? We have appointments for pedicures. You told me you didn't want to have skanky feet at your baby shower. That was today? Technically, it was 30 minutes ago. I'm so sorry, Susan. Kelly and I, we painted the nursery today and I completely forgot about our appointment. Oh, so you're with Kelly. Hi Susan. Susan... Uh huh? What do you think about if we change the baby shower from butterflies to flamingoes. And whose idea was that? Kelly said that a lot of people match the baby shower theme to the nursery. And you know how much I love coral. I mean if it's not too late. No, no. It's your shower. It should be exactly how you want it to be. You're so good to me. I know. Thanks. I hate baby showers. It's perfect. My reminder to take my pills. Em I don't want to tell you what to do, but are you sure that you should be taking those meds? It's just... psychotropics can cross the placenta... I know, but my therapist says that it's better to maintain a moderate dose in the long run. It outweighs the effects to the baby. She says in an emergency, you have to put on your own oxygen mask before you can help your child. This is the same thing. I'm sure your therapist is right. But you have to trust your own instincts. Only you know what's best for you and your baby. How did I get so lucky? It's like you moved in across the street just for me. I'm no angel. Well, angel or not, thank you for everything. You're welcome. I know what's best for my baby. Mommy loves you. Rock a bye baby on the treetop, when the wind blows the cradle will rock. When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall. Wow. What do you think? It's incredible. I need to get over my fear. I need to embrace this new baby. And love her. And I need to get ready for her arrival. You're amazing. Yeah. Just gotta promise me you're not gonna close me out. No more closed doors. And I was thinking maybe you could come home early once in a while. I think that sounds great. Pinky swear? Double pinky swear. Look at you hot momma. You are amazing and sexy. You are sexy and amazing. Don't tell me you actually like this baby bump? You do like it! You actually like it. Oh Em, yes. Are you kidding me? Don't you worry, I'll be back in a couple of hours. Ride's here! Wow. Door-to-door service. Have a good time. Hey, why don't you bring your Doppler? That way your friends can all hear your baby's heartbeat. That's a great idea. I'll see you later. Have fun. What's this? Raspberry Nettle. My midwife says that it tones the uterus. It's sweet. A midwife is never wrong. How are you? I'm really good, how're you doing? I'm glad you could make it. Be right back. You're here! Come on in. And welcome. Oh my gosh, Susan it looks beautiful. Wait till you see the games I've planned. Kelly, do you mind if I steal Emily for a sec? No, of course. Okay, so what's going on with the she-wolf? You mean Kelly? Yes, Kelly. I tried to look her up on social media and it's like she's invisible. She doesn't have Instagram, Twitter, not even Facebook. Okay, so because she likes her privacy that makes her suspicious? Yes! Like it or not, there's something odd about her. There's something odd about you right now. True. Are you okay? Yeah sorry I just feel a little dizzy. Can I get a glass of water? Oh, of course. Make yourself comfortable. Emily! You look amazing. My goodness, you've gotten so big. I can't take her anywhere. You're perfect, absolutely perfect. Thank you, but if you don't mind, please don't touch my belly. It makes me uncomfortable. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's me. So, how are you feeling? Any cravings? Chocolate has been good to me. I loved being pregnant. Really? The heartburn, the hemorrhoids, the varicose veins? Melinda! You've never had a baby. Yeah, but I read the mommy blogs. Here you go. Thank you. Is everything okay? I don't know... I just don't feel right. Oh, I remember the vertigo I used to get. You should have a seat. Everybody, it's okay! Hey, what's going on? She's not kicking. I haven't felt a kick in awhile now. I can't feel anything. She's probably sleeping. Enjoy it while you can. She's not moving. Emily... What's going on? Oh my god, what's happening? We are going to listen to her heartbeat. Come on, please! I don't hear anything, where's her heartbeat? Emily... Quiet! What is going on? Not again... not again... That's our Jillian. Excuse me for a minute. I feel sick. Em, are you okay? I'm coming in. I'm sorry. Please, you're fine. I guess I should go downstairs and see my guests, right? Your only job is to be here taking care of you and your baby. Take a few deep breaths. I'm gonna go take care of everything. You think she's crazy again? Is everything okay? Emily's had quite a scare. I think the party's over. Did Emily say that? Yeah, she's asked everyone to leave. I think she really needs to rest. Can I say goodbye? I don't think that's a very good idea. Okay. Well, tell Emily I hope she makes a quick recovery. Of course. Grab a flamingo on the way out. I'm gonna go sit with Emily. Do you mind handing me her purse? Thank you Susan. You okay? I don't even know. You just sit tight and I'll get everything set up for you. That's not necessary. Em. It's okay to let people take care of you sometimes. Alright? Ready. Thank you. I have water and chocolate and I turned down your bed. What's this? It's not yours? I've never seen it before. What? Oh my god. Lemon verbena... this is Susan's perfume. You were right about Peter. I'm sure there's an explanation. I need to be alone. Please. I understand, but you have to stay calm for the baby. I'm gonna make you a cup of camomile tea, and then I'll leave, okay? Okay, I need you to push hard. He's not breathing. What's going on? Can somebody please tell me what's wrong with my baby? He's gone. I knew this pregnancy was gonna be hard. I had no idea it was gonna be this hard. Just when I thought it was going to be ok... another scare. Peter... Yeah... I'm sorry. We'll be there for Emily. Okay? Whatever she needs. We can do it. I need another one. I'll come with you and see if Em's up. Let's go. Em? You're up? What happened to you today? I don't know. I'm glad you're here, Susan. I have something of yours. Where'd you get that? You think I'm blind? Em? And you, with your talk of love and trust and fidelity. I can't believe I bought that crap. My eyes are open. I heard how you guys come home in the middle of the day arm in arm. And now I find this? I don't understand. Stop it, Peter. I see you, the way you look at each other. The way you touch each other. And I know... I know! This can't be happening. Look Emily, everything is gonna be okay. Stop trying to handle me, Susan. Emily! I know what you two are doing. Everybody knows... After Sammy, you were convinced I was gonna leave you. You made these stories of other women... about Susan. But they weren't true. I love you. I've always loved you. Isn't that touching? How about this? Stop screwing my best friend and then we'll hug it out later. Emily! I'm sorry. It's okay. You know, if you ask me, I think your neighbor's been stirring the pot. Kelly? I don't think so. Who else would know that we came here in the middle of the day? Well, whatever it is, thanks for sticking with us. Thanks for sticking with Emily. She's my best friend. I should talk to her alone. Good night, Susan. Did you take your meds? Yes. We gotta see Dr. Miller again. Why? Because I'm speaking the truth? No. Because what you're saying doesn't make any sense. You think because I was ill, you can put this on me? But I know what I've seen. You spend more time with her than you do me and you want me to think it's innocent. It is. Don't... don't! You've got to calm down. You want me to calm down? Then I want you to leave. What? I mean it, Peter. You're stressing me out and I can't trust you. It's not good for the baby. You need to go. I don't want to upset you. You know, this pregnancy has been hard. My only consolation is that life can't be that cruel twice. Maybe we'll get a chance to start over. Hey hon, how you doing? I'm okay. Are you sure, because you don't sound very good. I confronted Peter and Susan about the affair, and they denied it. Sweetie... It's okay, I'm fine. But I had to kick Peter out. Oh, Em. I just wanted to say thank you. Because it seems like... you're the only one who's on my side. I'll always look out for you and your baby. I don't know what I would do without you right now. Well luckily, you never have to find out. I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Good night. Night. Dial Emily Jones. We're sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is not accepting calls from this number. You've got to be kidding me. Dial Emily Jones. We're sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is not accepting calls from this number. Time to do this old school. Open up! Emily! Open the door! I need to talk to you! Hi, sorry to bother you. Aren't you Mrs. Johnson's housekeeper? I am. Are you working for her niece now? Kelly Conway? The old lady has no niece - no family at all. But Kelly is living here. I don't know who you're talking about. Kelly moved in right after Mrs. Johnson died. Oh, you didn't know that she died. No, I didn't. I'm so sorry that you found out like this. It's all right, she was a horrible woman. Looking for something? You're going to hurt my baby. You aren't even pregnant! No, but I am gonna have a baby. I'm just growing it in your ex-best friend right now. Emily? Baby Jillian is almost ready to meet her new momma. You're insane! Really? Because I think that I'm pretty clever. Some people are so desperate for companionship that they ignore their intuition, like Emily. That old lady was like that, too. Sheila didn't want to live any more. So I just granted her wish. With you, I'm granting mine. Told you to mind your own business. Come on Em, please answer the door! Good morning. What's all this? Saturday morning scones. No strings attached. Don't you have a doctor's appointment today? Yes. Thanks for checking up on me like I'm a child. That's not what I meant. Do you want me to go with you? No. I'm used to going alone. There's nothing happening between me and Susan. I have nothing further to say to you, until you admit the affair. You can go now. Once again, everything looks perfect. How are things at home? My husband called you? Yes. He did. We're just going through some personal problems, but we will get through them. I'm fine. Yes. Yes. And how's your support system? Fine. Is anyone looking in on you? Yeah. To tell you the truth, I don't know what I'd do without Kelly Conway. She's been my rock. She used to be one of your patients. Doesn't ring a bell. Maybe this will help. That's Bridget Miller. At least when she was my patient, her name was Bridget. Excuse me. This must be a mistake. Kelly Conway. She's my neighbor and she's seven months pregnant. I'm sorry, I can't say anything more. Bridget deserves her privacy just like all my patients. See you next week? Make that happen. Thanks, excuse me. How's Wednesday at 10 AM? Yes, it's fine. See you then. Emily, I heard you talking about a patient named Bridget. Well if its the Bridget I think it is, you need to be careful. A few years ago, she had a full hysterectomy. After the surgery, she came in for follow-ups and became obsessed with our pregnant patients. It made all of us very uncomfortable. In the end, Dr. Rodman had no choice. He refused to treat her. She went ballistic and the police had to remove her. That sounds horrible. But... it must be someone else, because... my friend is pregnant. Oh, then I must be mistaken. Yeah. Kelly? Are you there? Bridget? Pick up, come on! Susan. This is Em. Look, I think you were right about Kelly. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please call me. Hello? Emily? What's wrong? I tripped and I fell down the basement stairs. Oh my god, I'll call 911. No no no don't, it's okay! It's not that bad. I just need some help with the stairs. I think I should call... No, please! Of course, I'll be right there. Kelly? Where are you? Emily! I'm around back. Oh my god, are you okay? I think so. Can you move? Yeah I'm sorry, I just got so scared. It's okay. Thank you for coming. Of course! I brought the Doppler. I thought we should check on baby first thing. Yeah okay. Awake now, are we? How's our baby? Moving okay? Kelly... Why are you doing this? You're not... I'm not. You want my baby. Yeah. And the truth is I don't think you can appreciate the amount of planning that went into this. This was a lot of work and just a little bit of luck. I am exhausted. Remember the mysterious blood? The way that I made everybody think that you were crazy. Or your baby not moving at your baby shower? All of that was me. And you even believed that Peter was cheating. I've got a phone call to make. Lay down and take a nap. Em... I know what you're going through. Susan! Susan! Oh my god, oh my god... Susan, I'm so sorry... Somebody help me, please! Somebody help me! Hello? Hey Peter, it's Kelly. Is everything okay? Yeah... Emily and I were supposed to go for a walk this afternoon and there's no answer at the door or on her cell. I'm worried. I'll head to the house now. Call me when you get there. Okay. This is Emily. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Emily... look, I know you're angry with me, but Kelly called - she can't get ahold of you. I'm worried. Call me, please. When was the last time you saw her? This morning at the house. Em and I were supposed to go for a walk this afternoon. She's pregnant. About 8 and a half months along. Her car is here, but her phone and her purse are missing. What about her pills? I can go check. The bottle's full. You have to tell him. Tell me what? We had a child die at birth. After the tragedy, my wife went missing. She was gone for three days. We found her in a park watching children. We'll issue an APB once she's gone 24 hours. But if she comes home sooner, give us a call. You can't do anything now? We'll keep an eye out until then. Thank you. She could hurt herself, she could hurt the baby... Stop. All we know right now is that she's missing. You found her last time, right? She'll be okay. Have faith. I should really go. Call me if you need anything or hear anything. Yeah, thanks. Plan B. Emily? Emily back away om the door, I have a gun! Please don't hurt my baby. You mean my baby? Please don't hurt her. I would never hurt Jillian. I love her. Now you're gonna drink this, every last drop, and if you don't I will hurt you. Do you understand? Do you understand? What is it? A little bit of this, little of that. Nothing that's gonna hurt the baby. Glug, glug, glug. Good... just relax. It's time to go. Peter! I'm so sorry I scared you. No, it's okay. I was gonna drive around the neighborhood, see what I could see. I'm going crazy. I've called her friends. I visited the hospitals and... Susan, I haven't reached Susan in two days. Well they've been fighting. What else do I do? Can I come with you? What you really need to do right now is to go home so that when Emily gets there, you're there for her because she's going to need you. You're right, Kelly. Thank you. I don't know what we'd do without you. Emily would do the same thing for me. Go back home, I'll call you if I see anything. Mommy's coming! I don't have time for this! We've got holes to dig, labor to induce. Okay... Keys? Looking for these? Get out. Now! Dig. I can't. Please, no. Dig. No, it's too early. I said dig! Why are you doing this? Why? Us being here tonight, you, me and Jillian. It's not a coincidence. I chose you. Both of you. We were togtether that night when you lost your baby in the hospital. I came in for a minor surgery. Everything was just fine until Dr. Rodman had to leave. I started to bleed and I called out for help, but nobody came. By the time anyone did, it was too late and I lost my uterus. I found out later it's because they were too preoccupied with you and your dead baby. I go back to work and we get a 911 call. You had disappeared. A few days later, the police found you. Now I have all of your information. And I get to watch you and Peter rebuild your lives. So sweet. You even got pregnant with little baby Jillian. My sweet baby girl. Jillian will never be yours. It'll start with the small things. You'll smile at her and she won't respond. You'll got to kiss her and she'll pull away. And then she'll tell you, "I hate you, you're not my mother, I hate you. Shut up! When you look in her eyes, it'll be me looking back at you. Shut up! I thought I said shut up! Are you going into labor? 911, what's your emergency? Yes, I need an ambulance. My water broke. I'm having a baby. I'm in Midville Clearing. We turned down a dirt road. Please hurry. Doctor, have you seen Emily Jones? Hey dad! Peter, you're here! I'm so happy you're here. I'm sorry about everything. Please, there's nothing you need to worry about right now except our daughter. Okay, the baby's crowning. Emily, get ready to push. Breathe. I need you to talk to me. Okay, what do you want me to say? Anything. Okay, remember the time that we met? At the bar on Collins? Okay here she comes, ready? Push, now! Good, good job. Breathe now, breathe. Dad help us out! Go, we're gonna push again and... push! Good! Hello, little girl! She's perfect! She's okay? She's perfect? Can I open them now? Stay right there. Don't open your eyes. Okay. Now? Nope, don't open them. Okay, open them. Butterflies... Thank you baby...
