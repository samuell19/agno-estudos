Run, run! Get it! No, no. Let me go, please. Hold him tight! Hold him tight! Hold the boy! - Shit! - Stop him! Leave him alone. Hey, stranger, get over here. Don't you know it's dangerous to put your nose in other peoples' business? It looked like fun, so I joined in. Fun is just what they were having. He was just invited to a party, and he's the guest of honor. It'll be a family party. He doesn't look anxious to go to your party. That's exactly the reason why we invited him. Why don't you come, too? I like the tip of your trigger finger. Isn't it a pity that every time you shoot a man, you're wasting gold? Don't you save it for special occasions? Listen, I've got a proposal for you. On my ranch, I have living quarters for a man like you. Come work for me. Maybe. It depends on what work you need done. Tie him up tight! Don't be afraid that you'll hurt him. - Pedro! - Yes, boss. Take one of my fastest horses and visit his father. Tell him we want all the gold he found on the outlaws they hung... ...or we'll kill his son. Also tell him I want all of it soon. I'm anxious to close this deal. Sure thing, boss. Right away. Boys, there will be gold for all of you. What are your thoughts, my friend? I myself believe fathers have a strong love for their sons. While we're all waiting, let's entertain our handsome, young guest. Guarnito! Hurry! We're waiting to begin the party. Why not sit down? Go on, sit there. Make yourself at home, next to me. Don't my boys have a good time here? Why don't you join in the fun? Come on. Drink up. Eat something. Before you know it, you'll feel like one of us. The place, the food, and the drink satisfy man's basic needs... ...and even more refined sensations, like crying, for instance. This doesn't seem right. You, holding the kid hostage. I didn't know you were a model citizen. Come on, you must have broken the law at some time in your life. You handle a gun noticeably well, stranger. Yeah. I have good reason to practice. It is unlikely you got all that practice being an honest, law abiding man. You'll enjoy being a member of my gang. It should be quite obvious. Mirami, my boys are hard workers... ...so I give them the best of everything. See for yourself. I taught them well, to enjoy good things. If I have to pay the ransom for my son's life... ...you should help, too. Why should l? He's your son. You pay with your share of the gold. We're partners. We share the same secret. You pay your ransom, not me. My share is not enough. They'll kill him. Don't you see they're determined to get all of the gold back? Not my share. That stays with me. The kid is not my responsibility. I thought you were my partner. I am your partner, Templer, but the boy is yours. My God, you're scum. Let me go or I'll shoot. I'll make you pay. Where are you? Can't you make up your mind quickly about the gold? Take it easy, there. Help yourself as much as you want. Tell them they've got 5 minutes to make up their lousy minds. - Did he agree? - No. He wouldn't give it to you? No. I couldn't make him understand. That was our chance to get our hands on all of it. You mean, to sacrifice my son? Can't you see it's only a bluff? They're just trying to scare you-- I'm not going to take that risk. The trouble is, you're weak as water. You'd be a fool, telling them you've managed to get all the gold. Deny it! Deny it! Make them think you don't have it. Here he comes. It's no good. He says he doesn't have the gold. He asked you to let the boy go. I have a job for you, stranger. Carry this kid's corpse back to his father. Max! You know what to do. Wait a minute. I have an idea how he can be of use to us. I'll get your gold. You want to save the boy, don't you? Guess I'm getting old. All right. You must first shoot that rope there... ...the one that ties him to the wall. I know you're an excellent shot, so it should be easy for you. But not so easy after drinking the rest of this whisky. How about that? I want to see if you're a good drinker. He can get drunk. Silence! Drinking is like playing. You need concentration. Now we'll see what kind of man you really are. Pablo. Stop. I'll handle this. Very smart. You surprised me, friend. Very smart. But you should know better-- The boy is still tied up. I'll give him to you anyway. Cut that cord! Hurry up! His life has been saved. Cheer up, boy, if you want to please your father. You should start praying for death... ...because now your life is worth less than the gold or the sand in the desert. What's this? A funeral? Get on with the party. Who fired a gun? - I don't know. - It was a gunshot. - Where did the shot come from? - From the stable. What happened? It was an accident. He was playing with my gun. He was looking for trouble. I know how you must feel, stranger, after you did your best to save him. He didn't want to be a man. What do you mean? A man must take on responsibility. A man does what he must do, and accepts the consequences. I'd say he died like a man. My offer is still open to you, if you want to accept it. Take him back to town, to his father, and get all the gold he's hidden. If he doesn't cooperate, he'll have visitors. I'll go, but I don't think it will do any good now. I think it depends on you. Pablo, saddle up that horse. - You see anyone? - Not yet. Why don't they come? What is it? The stranger is bringing him in now. What happened? How is he? You better prepare yourself, Templer. It doesn't look good. Here they are. Come on, take him. Take him. Help me with him. Come on, move away from the table. My poor boy, what did they do? Are you mad? He was disgusted of a father like you. Hold him. What's wrong with him? He must be out of his mind... ...to have no respect for the feelings of a father for his son. Kick him out of here, once and for all. You'd better give up that gold, Templer. Or they'll come and get you. Are you going to just let him walk out of here? No, not now. There is too much wickedness. They don't know you still have many gold bullets in your gun. Son, you must have a lot of faith. When you finish all your bullets, you must leave. We have a common enemy. You know who I mean. You must be very careful of a man like Templer. He has always threatened me with violence. He's come into my house, where I live. I didn't think any house in this town would welcome a guest. Mine's different. If a stranger comes to my door, tired and hungry... ...he's always welcome. Come on, stranger. Why are you so generous? Because I'm scared. I've been threatened. You can protect us. I must have protection. I'll pay you. I do everything myself. I don't have any servants. I don't trust them. They steal and, there are too many nice things here. Eat up. I'm sure you're hungry. You'll get special treatment, if you'll just stay here. You won't believe this, but I treat everybody specially. An honest person can't sleep well in this town. Are you afraid to live alone? Yes, I am afraid... ...and I've been unfortunate. I saw a woman up in that window. You've already seen her? She's my wife. But she might as well not exist. She's unbalanced. The girl is insane. I had to lock her up in her room, poor creature. She wouldn't harm anyone. She has the mind of a child. If anything happened to me... ...Sorrow's men would come around. What if Templer came here. A man with no religious principles or morals. That's why the Lord struck down his son. He lives with that woman openly and they're not married. Everybody talks about that scandal. Please say you'll protect us. I want to go out. She always does it. She is always like this. There is nothing I can do. We better find that stranger and kill him before it gets dark. And see about those 2 lndian men. We have a fine reason to beat them. Do whatever you want, but be sure he's as dead as a doornail tomorrow. All right, boss, leave it to me. It's a good bed... But you don't want to fall asleep. What's that? Like this, don't turn it out. I want you to rest, but stay awake. I'm exhausted. You can't stop me from sleeping. I'm getting up early and hitting the road. Good night. I said, "Good night!" I knew I'd find you in here. I heard voices and somebody moving about. Don't you recognize me? Sure. I saw you in the window. You didn't understand the signs I was making to you. What were you trying to tell me? To get out of here. You're in danger. You don't know what people are like here. You're different from them. You must not stay here. I've got to save you. Why do you think I'm in danger? They are trying to murder you. Life in this place is worth nothing. Look at me. What's your name? Elizabeth. Your husband says you are crazy. He's evil. He wants me to think I'm mad. He nearly succeeded. Why does he want to do that? Because I fell in love with someone... I've been locked up ever since. Then you're not really mad. I don't know. What's the matter? It's just... There must be someone to love me. He left your door unlocked? Why did he do that? Because he wants me to make sure you stay to defend his house. Where's the gun? Get out of here while there is time. You haven't kissed me yet. My love! My love! What's going on? It's Sorrow's men! Arm yourself. Wait at the window. But don't shoot! Templer, open up. We've got to do something. Hide the gold. - I know where to hide it. - Where? Templer, you can't stop us. Do you hear? We're not playing around. We're coming in. All right boys, break the door. You take care of the horses... ...the rest of you get up there and break that door down. Go for it! Have you no respect for the dead?! The saloon is closed. We're in mourning here. Listen to that, anybody will think it's true. You know what to do. Cover every corner of the house. Templer, either you tell us where you hid it... ...or we're going to kill you. You've searched this place from top to bottom. You see, the gold ain't here. It's been taken by that dirty rat, Oldeman. You'll find it at his house. If you're lying, watch out. Quick! They're here. Save me. Look, they're here! No! Get away from the window. Do something. That's why you're here-- to protect me. Am I suppose to protect your house... ...your reputation or your wife? Do you have anything of greater value? There is light over there. We'll have fun. The house is this one. Oldeman! Oldeman! We're coming for the gold. Here it is. Take it. Give it to them, before they harm you. You're mad. Leave her alone. Come on, Oldeman, open up! We don't like waiting. Open! - Somebody is there. - Open the door. Give us the gold! Don't waste our time. He's not him, Willy. It's the gold! It's the stranger! Kill him. Get the horses and let's go. Don't be afraid. It's all over. She betrayed me... a servant in my house... ...no better than that. Damn that half-breed. I'll show them both... ...together they'll know who I am. I know I can't help you. You should try to forget it. Don't be so sad. You know I love you. I'm sure I can help. I can't love you. I've got to finish what I've started. I know. I've always known that would be your answer. You'd leave me. Where is my gun? I have given you the power to walk upon serpents and scorpions... ...to withstand the light of adversary, whoever they may be. If who so ever among you say, "l shall be great", shall be small. Who so ever shall say, "l shall be first", shall be last. For the son of God came among you, not to be served... ...but to serve you. He gave his life so that you may live. Amen. What a day! Give me a drink. Rotten thief, now you know what it costs to double-cross me. That will fix you and him at the same time. He must have taken it while we were sleeping. I want to know why. I better go find him. What are you going to do when the others come back to get the gold? If you want, I'll stay. No, they'll kill you. Don't worry. Go now, and some day come back for me. If you don't, I shall die. - Sure filled him full of holes. - A good job. Left his gun behind. The chamber is empty. I know this gun. I'm sure I do. Hey! Wait a minute. This bullet is solid gold. It's the stranger! He murdered Templer. Go and get him. What are you waiting for? Lori. Where the devil is Lori? I haven't seen her. She's a bad woman. I'm sure she's got something to do with this. Better get going. Take your guns. Yes, let's go. Come on! Hey, mister. Hey, you! Come here. Listen, I'm terrified. I want you to help me. They're going to kill me. Oldeman has killed Templer. It was awful. I managed to get away. I saw him do it. I saw him kill Templer. Where did he do it? In the saloon. We just came from the funeral. Now he wants to kill me. I'm in danger because I saw him do it. I don't stand a chance in hell against Oldeman. He's a highly respected citizen. He can kill me and make it look perfectly legal. Would you like to be rich? What do you mean by that? Exactly what do you want me to do? I know where he hid all of Templer's gold. If you help me get it, we'll split it. Where is it? At the cemetery. In Evan's coffin. I don't have the courage to get it myself... ...but there is enough gold down there to do things that-- Listen here. If anyone tries to open that boy's coffin... ...I'll make sure he's shot. Haven't you done enough? That gold belongs to Evan. But we need it to leave this place. We've got to get out of here before they kill us. Your life is in danger as well as mine. What do you think of this baby? All right, are you ready? Let's go. Come on, hurry up! Now we'll see some action. You heard him. Get going. If you want to sleep in your beds, then find those two. Make sure they won't do any more harm in our town. Let's get rid of him. Search everywhere. Let's stay together. Look everywhere. Hey, his friends are here. Oh, those lndians...they always hang around with him. There they are! Those dirty lndians! They'll know where he is. They always do. Let's make them talk. Let me get my hands on them. Kill him. Don't shoot him. It's a sin. I always wanted the scalp. A perfect job! A perfect hairdresser. Well done. It was so easy. They're coming to get you. You must hide. How many of them are there? The whole town! Let's go! Hold it, stranger. You can't get away this time. Come on, Willy, stop. This man is ours. Now you'll have to answer to Mr. Sorrow. Where is he? What have you done? Your precious lover? Sorrow's man took him away and tortured him to death. I thought you'd be pleased. I'll deal with you later. Come here. You'll never get out of here alive. Hold it. We don't want him unconscious. You're very stupid... ...when you could have taken advantage of my offer... ...to become one of my boys. We could be friends, but you prefer to go your own way, don't you? You are going to tell me where that gold is. You made a mistake. An elementary mistake. Now, you're gonna have to pay. Mr. Sorrow doesn't like to be cheated. You'll tell me even if I cut your tongue out. Carlos, go and prepare our persuasive little pets. We'll have to get going, but you won't be lonely. I'm going to make sure you have nice company. Do you like the company of snakes or blood-sucking vampire bats? Rats can also be good company. You won't be lonely. Carlos, let's wish him a good night. Come on. It's useless, Sorrow. You can't scare me. You don't know me. We'll see. We'll see. I've made stronger men than you tell me everything. You'll change your ideas soon. Come on, Carlos. Sleep easy. Willie, Canada, Carlos. Come on, all of you. We can get going! Our prisoner has been persuaded to talk. We know where the gold has been hidden. Search everywhere. Go now. Go! The cemetery...the cemetery. Having a good time with your friends? Interesting, isn't it? It's better than any party. The cemetery... If everything goes as planned, they should be back before dawn. Don't you want a drink? How did you get here? You don't believe that this is just for playing music? That's right, corporal. A drink! A drink! All right, you dirty, old drunk! It's a pity you don't understand what my boys mean to me. They make me so happy in their black uniforms. Drink, you feathered sponge. You'll like it. Damn it. There's no gold in there. We've been tricked. It must have been here. We've got to find that gold! Go on. What are you waiting for? Open every grave. Get going. Dig! Dig! Dig, damn it. We've got to find that gold. Dig! We'll find that gold if we have to tear up every grave in this cemetery. Give me the explosives. Take as much as you can. Come on, let's go. Here, take this. Come on, let's go. Here they come. Go, go. It's the Boss's horse. Get him. Stop him. Go the other way. Get him. Something's wrong. Get him. I finally got him. Damn you. What have you done, maniac? It's burning. It's the upper floor. Everything is burning. How did it happen? I hope no one is inside. You'd better come out quick. Move yourself, come on. We must pray. Can any of you get down on their knees and pray? I've never seen a fire like this. What a shame. It was a beautiful place. He was proud of it, wasn't he? There's no point in letting a house burn down like this. I won't give you 2 bits for it. Did you hear the screams? You can't get close. Fortunately it's isolated. Or the whole town could've burnt down. Let's get out of here. It's too dangerous. It can collapse any moment. Look at me!
