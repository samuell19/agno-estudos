The year 1920 marked the beginning of provincialism in Indonesia. R.A Tuti Marini Puspowardojo from Java and Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie from Bugis were married. This was considered a violation of family traditions. As a result, they were separated from their tribes. 8 years after The Youth Pledge in 1928, their fourth child was born. A boy who would later promote pluralism and unity in the Indonesian archipelago. Rudy! Airplane! Rudy! Come on! Quick! - Rudy! - Watch out! Ma'am! Ma'am! It's the Japanese planes! - We are being bombed. We need to evacuate. - Oh my God. Come on! Come on! Toto, ask that man! Rudy! Fanny! Come on, Rud! Fanny! Rudy, wait! Rudy, come quick! Rudy! Fanny! - Mom! - Rudy! Fanny! Rudy! Oh God. Where have you been? The planes bombed the harbor, Mom. Mom, did you bring my book and meccano? No, I just brought some clothes. Rudy! Go on! Don't! Rudy! Are you crazy? I can't leave my book and meccano. Hurry! Tuti! - Dad! - Fan! Tuti! Come on! There! My book! - My meccano! - Rudy! What's this? What are you doing? Tuti. Don't! Just take it! Take it! Just take it! Take it! Bomb! Aachen, Germany Hello, good afternoon. Are you Pastor Gilbert? Yes, I am. I'm Rudy. Rudy Habibie. I am a student from Indonesia. Your German is very good. You can speak Indonesian? Romo Soegijapranoto was my friend ... ... when I was in a seminary in Semarang. - You know him? - Yes. I do. He reconciled the five day war in Semarang. That's right. Here's the thing, Rudy. I was assigned to assist you. And I'm glad to be of assistance. Because I miss speaking Indonesian. - You can speak Indonesian with me. - Right. - And I miss the food from Jogja. - I can't help you with that. - Here. - Oh, yes. Thanks. - Well, let's find a place for you to stay. - Yes. So why do students need to be supervised? Not all of them do. Most Indonesian students who study here are already old. So they don't need to be supervised by priests. I see. But I've been taking care of myself since I was fourteen. You are very lucky, Rudy. You're blessed with intelligence. It's very difficult to be a student in this country. The Germans appreciate talented people like you. Whoever they are, wherever they come from, whatever talents they have, ... they are all supported and given a chance. This is delicious, Rudy. Can I ... One, please. It's like this, Rudy. In Germany, everyone is appreciated. For example this street vendor, Rudy. He is talented. He's appreciated in Germany. That guitar player is appreciated. Try it. Is it good? Yes. He's talented. Well it's pork, so of course it's tasty. What? Is this pork? Well, yes. Are you a Muslem, Rudy? - Yes, I am. I don't eat pork. - Oh my, Rudy. We learn from our mistakes. Can I ask for a refund? Good afternoon, Mrs. Gunther. I'm Pastor Gilbert. Can you accommodate this young man? From which country? From Indonesia. I have never heard of that country. The name is long and strange. - Let's try another house. - Okay. It's ok, Rud. We'll try this one. This way, I think. Whose house is this? It's interesting. It belongs to a Dutch-German couple. Yes, okay. Pastor Gilbert. Mrs. Gunther just called me. We cannot accommodate overseas students. I understand, Ma'am. But I urge you, please. This young man needs a place to stay. Sorry, but my husband is busy. Fixing his new heater. It utilizes hot water, right? Yes. You can speak Dutch? Yes. Wait a minute. - I told you ... - Rudy, let's look for another place. You don't need to replace the heater. - Now we're having this problem! - No, no Rudy! Be quiet! It wasn't supposed to be like this. I already ... Can I help you? Who are you? I'm sorry, Mr. Neuefeiend. He's a graduate student at RWTH. But he ... Ma'am ... Can I have ... ... a glass of water and a tray. Just do what he says. Give him what he needs. Here you go. Thank you, Ma'am. Pastor. Can you vouch for this young man? Wouldn't he break my heater? I hope not. Oh my God, what are you doing? What are you doing with that rock? It cost me two months salary! Rud, what are you doing? Okay. The heater was too tilted. So the hot water inside was not flowing smoothly. And the pressure was not optimal. This way, the noise will disappear. I see. What's that tray for? To expand the heat. The distance between the wall and the machine is too wide. So the heat was being wasted. This way, it is much more practical and saves energy. Stop! I'll continue that tomorrow. The heater is already functioning. Now we can remove our coats. The rock and the oven tray ... ... are just temporary. Tomorrow, would be better for you ... ... to call the service center. Are all the students ... - ... in your country like you? - That's right. Well, we'll take your leave. Wait, wait. Where are you going? We have a vacant room upstairs. This room is not appropriate. No heater. And there is only a toilet attached. You have to go to the public bathroom outside to take a shower. What do you think? I'll take it, Pastor. You don't have to take it if you're not comfortable. Don't worry. I only sleep for four hours a day. The sooner I have a room, the sooner I can study. - Ma'am. - Yes? Thank you. (RECITING THE HOLY QUR'AN) LANDERAI VILLAGE, PAREPARE (RECITING THE HOLY QUR'AN) Stop. (RECITING THE HOLY QUR'AN) Pay attention to your pronunciation when studying The Al-Qur'an. If misread, the meaning changes. - Is that so? - Yes. This must be easy for you, Captain. Being an Arab, you probably understand The Al-Qur'an. Not necessarily. The Al-Qur'an uses metaphorical language. Islam has a deep respect for knowledge. Therefore, you should keep studying. - Peace be with you. - You, too. - Captain. - What is it? I need to talk to you, Captain. The Allies have conquered Parepare. Soon they will reach Landerai. We must leave, Captain. My God. Daeng, sound the alarm. Kids, let's hurry up and go home. - Come on, everybody. - Come on. Be careful. Come on, careful. Come on, come on. Be careful, be careful. Your mother and brother are already at the harbor. Where are we going now, Dad? We are going to meet your mother and brother at the harbor. Hurry. Koene, ... are you sure your family will welcome us? Gorontalo Sir? Sir? Sir? Mr. Habibie? Yes? Alwi is here! Dear, our son has come home. Alwi is here. Daddy! My son. Koene, are you sure Rudy should be circumcised here? Tuti, if we truly want to make amends with my parents, ... this is the way. What do you think? Try to relax son, it won't hurt. Don't be afraid. It won't hurt. - Dad. Why did he say that? Is it going to hurt? - No. Don't be afraid. The most valuable treasure in this world is family ... ... and friends. Check! Yes! Checkmate! - Dad, you're happy here, aren't you? - Yes. This is my home, Rudy. It's where I'm from. The roots that I've left behind for so long. Rudy, take a deep breath. I wonder when we can come back here. It takes three days and three nights to get from Parepare to Gorontalo. - What about Java? - That's even further. Must be nice to be a bird. We could fly anywhere. Then, build a plane, Rudy. I don't like planes. They're evil. Don't make combat planes. Make a plane that could take people like Grandma, ... Grandpa, Mom or Dad to meet all their relatives. - So that their roots will all be close to one another? - Yes. Makasar - Dad! - Let's eat, while it's still warm. My meccano keeps breaking when I fly it. Creating planes require calculations. They can't be randomly created. Sounds tough. What can I read to learn how to make them? Later. You'll learn, son. Enough, Rud. Come have breakfast, now. - You could start by reading the books in the library. - Wait, Mom. You wouldn't want this meccano to break again, Would you? - No! - Rudy. Koene, you, too. Let's eat. The wind moving from below makes your hand move up and down. That's the basic logic behind why planes can fly. - You mean everything that flies does so because of that? - Yes. - Except for balloons. - Balloons? What about them? Here! Look for something that looks like this, its called a balloon. - This is what I need. - But what can a balloon do? My Dad said, if the air inside the balloon is lighter than the air outside, ... - then it can fly. - So what if it can fly? We can build it just like the one in this book. This balloon can take people from one country to another. - You're lying! - Yes, you are. Hey, Maleo! You don't believe the kid who is always first in class? Nothing! Ula! I found a balloon! Balloon! Balloon! Balloon! Rudy! We found a balloon! Balloon! Balloon! Balloon! Dad! Dad, why is this balloon shaped like this? It can't fly. My God! Where did you get this? Rudy, this is dirty! Where did you get this? Dear! Come here, quickly! - Look! - Oh my God! - Who gave that to you? Rudy? - Rudy! What have you done with it? - I blew it. - Oh my God! - Come here! - Ouch, Mom! Come! Get over there. My God! Come here! Why would you play with such things? Hurry up, wash your mouth! Why would you play that way? Come on. - It's hot, Mom! - Deal with it! Come on! Gargle properly. Stop! I don't want to! Do you even know what that is? It's dirty! What did I do wrong, Mom? I was just playing with a balloon! Balloon? Fanny! Did you blow that balloon, too? No, Mom. Who else played with the balloon? Ok, let's pray together. - Fanny! - Yes, Dad. Dad, your sarong. Rudy, let's pray together. Dad, I think I need lighter materials than this meccano. Birds can fly because their feathers are light, right? Let's pray first. After that, we'll work on it together. Promise, Dad? I promise. - Have you washed up? - Yes. Tidy up. - Toto! - Yes. - Let's pray. (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) (RECITING PRAYER) Dad! Dad! Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy! - Daddy! Daddy! You promised to help me build a plane! What are you doing? I'm praying. - I'm Frank. - Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie. Call me Rudy. I'm from Indonesia. Ah, Indonesian. Your President just arrived in Bonn. It's on the national news. That's Gertz, Patrick and Ivon. Hello. Rudy. Why did you touch your head to the floor? That's what we refer to as 'sujud' or prostration. All Muslims around the world do that. All Muslims touch their heads to the floor ... ... when they're praying. Allows the blood in their body to flow to the brain. - Erbakan, from Turkey. - Frank. - Erbakan. - Gertz. - Erbakan. - Hello. Ivon. - Erbakan. Turkey. - Rudy. Indonesia. - Bye! - Bye! - Nice to meet you, Rudy. - Nice to meet you too. - Rudy? - Keng Kie? Didn't you just start studying in Bandung four months ago? I deliberately skipped some levels to catch up with you! You're crazy! - Where are you staying? - One and a half hours away from here. I'm staying with a Dutch-German couple. Liem! Hello! Yes, hello!. What a coincidence. I have an invitation to go to Bonn. Tomorrow Mr. Soekarno will be there. Come, okay? You have to. I'm going to tell the others about it. - Who is he? - You'll find out. - So, you'll come to Bonn tomorrow? - No, I won't be joining you. I saw him at the Faculty of Engineering in Bandung. It's okay. Don't you miss warm rice? They have warm rice? Now that's a good idea. Long live Mr. Soekarno! Overseas scholarship students. You haven't come all the way to Europe for a vacation. You have to become doctors, ... engineers, and physicists. And then, come home. Your country will support you. You're funny! Don't get involved with them, Rud. They're former student soldiers. Sorry. Are they here to study or on duty? Both. They received scholarships as a reward from the government. Since they spent their youth fighting for freedom. This is their reward. You guys are here just for the rice, right? ... and for the cakes, too. Rudy, meet Ayu, daughter of The Sultan of Solo. - Ayu. - Rudy. - I'm Sugeng. - Rudy. Also a descendant of solo royalty. I'm Poltak Hasibuan from Lubuk Pakam. Not a descendant of The Sultan, nor Solo Royalty. But a descendant of clowns. - Come let me take a look. - Why a clown? - Look at your clothes. - What? Everything is mismatched. Yellow tie, red shirt, purple pants. Really? I thought this is your favorite color, dark blue. Sorry, the students here love to mess around. It's okay. Are you guys planning to take the RWTH entrance exams? When? Mine are next week. - Next week? - Are you serious, next week? - Yes. - Rudy, to take those exams, ... you have to study German first. I know. If not for Ayu, ... I would take that exam two years from now. Don't disgrace Medan, Poltak. - Mr. Ambassador. - How are you? Good. How's your brother? Thank God, he's been accepted in Kostrad. - Are you all in the same year? - Yes. Rudy here is supposed to be in his first semester. He skipped three years to catch up with me. Skipped? Are you a student or a squirrel? Jumping around. This country needs young people like Rudy. Brilliant, and courageous. But they tend to walk alone. I don't want you all to be like that. Yes, sir. You need to form a PPI. Already. We're planning to do that, right? Wait. What is PPI? PPI is Perhimpunan Pelajar Indonesia. The Association of Indonesian overseas students. College is not only about studying in a classroom, Rudy. I think Rudy needs to hang out with brother Poltak. To broaden his horizons. As long it's positive, I don't mind. Definitely positive. Right? Mr. Rudy. Yes. We have not received a transfer for you. What? Perhaps your mother forgot to send it. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello, Mom. Mom. How's everything in Bandung? We're all doing fine here. But yes, as you know, the economy is unstable right now. Prices are going up. But you don't need to worry, Rud. All we need to do is cut back a little. Did you receive the money I sent? Hello? Rudy, are you okay? Hello, Mom. I'm fine. Please don't worry. Most importantly, you need to focus on your education. If you need anything, just let me know. God willing, I will always be able to fulfill all your needs. Rudy? Hello? Hello? Hello. Mom. Mom, hello? Mom? God, what am I going to do? Excuse me. Is there a mosque around here? You're Indonesian? You can speak Indonesian? Yes. I lived there for a long time. Oh really? Do you know where the nearest mosque is? There isn't a mosque here. Only churches. Why don't you pray at home? I live far away from here. I need a place nearby for now. I need to find peace. I ... That's okay. No problem. Oh, God. I'm sure ... ... this building was built by people who believe in you. But I'm sure ... ... those people realized ... ... that there is only one God. Forgive me. I just want to say a prayer for my parents here. Because there is no other place. I don't want to disturb anyone. Forgive me. Forgive me, God. Rud. What is it? Nothing. I'm just enjoying the view. What view? Let's go to Cafe Leckere. Our friends are already waiting there. - No, that's okay, I'm going home. - Why? They have great sandwiches. Student prices. Come on. Yesterday was my birthday. I have treated everyone except you. Money from KBRI has come in already. How can the birthday guy be the one who treats? That's how I want it. Come on. Wait! I consider this a loan. - Okay? - Whatever. Come on. Keng Kie, let's take a photo. Rudy, Rudy. - Keng Kie. - Let's take a picture. - What? - There's a cinema here? - Yeah, upstairs. - This is good. I have to watch it. - Sure, Sure. - I would like to watch it. Yes, okay. Let's take a picture first. - You guys ready? - Okay. Ready? One, two, three. One more time. Ready? I'll count again. - One, two, three. - Okay. Is he new here? Who is he? You have to try the sandwich. Your Passport is green? How did you arrive in Aachen? My Mom is financing me. Why, is there an issue? Ah, rich boy, supported by his mom. He's a rich boy. Rudy is a genius. He skipped several levels at the Engineering Faculty of the University of Indonesia in Bandung. Genius, you say? If he's a genius, his passport should look like this. It should be blue. This proves that we are selected. National scholarship. The color is different, isn't it? What do you mean? What Panca means ... ... is that you are, sorry ... Stupid. Why are you laughing? - Look. - You're not being polite to your seniors. Look. Listen first. I just found out that intelligence is determined by the color of your passport. I skipped several levels because I'm smart. And that, is a fact. Your passport is blue ... ... as a reward from the Indonesian government for your former services in the army. - Right, Keng Kie? - Damn you! This is not the army! That's not the way to solve a problem. Remember, we have to maintain the good reputation of the student army. I agree, Peter. Gus, they are our juniors. We need to be polite to them. Tell you what, Rudy. Rudy, you can serve us our meal. This is Germany, not Indonesia. There is no student hazing here. This is not hazing, Peter. We just want to get to know our juniors. Don't worry, sit down. There's no problem. - I'll have a black coffee ... - Wait, let me write it down. You said you're a genius, why take notes? Okay. Go ahead. I'll have a black coffee and a sandwich. With cheese in the middle, ham at the top and bottom. Greens on the top most layer. What do you guys want to order? I'll have a hot coffee with a quarter cup of milk. - With two sugars. - Two sugars. Soft-boiled egg. Tuna sandwich, not greasy. Your orders? I'll have grilled sausages, not boiled. Lots of sauce. The barbeque sauce on the side and orange juice. Make sure it's fresh orange juice. - What else? - Sandwich and milk. Sandwich and milk. What about you, Peter? No need. I can order myself. You remember all of it? Sure. Is that all? Rudy if you miss anything, you'll have to pay for all of it. Panca! You're taking it too far. Relax. I'm sure he won't forget. He's a genius, right? I'm sure he is ... What if I get it all right? We will pay for all your meals for three days. Deal. Wait. Make it three sugars for me. - I'll have a hot tea as well. - Okay. Did I miss anything? Exactly as ordered. Here's the proof! You'll gain weight over the next three days, Rudy. Pal. Rudy Habibie. Rudy Habibie. Three days, pal. He remembered everything. Are you confident of all your answers? I'm positive. He must have a cheat sheet. Excuse me. Thank God, I'm in! Me, too! Thank God. I have to call my grandparents. We need to celebrate! - Keng Kie! - What? Your name is above mine. Here! Your name is not here. Please take a look at that one. Is it there? Wait. I want to look for my name. Excuse me. Rudy! Rudy! I ... - Rudy. - What now? I ... What happened? What's wrong? I failed, Keng Kie. Failed? Why? I want to go home, I failed. - Failed what? - I didn't pass the exam. I feel useless, like a complete failure. - There's nothing else I can do. - You must be mistaken. - Give me a chance. - I want to go home. Listen to me. Look at me. Give me a chance. Wait. You must be mistaken. Come on. - Where? - Help me. What am I going to do now? Don't be like this, Rudy. I think that is Rudy's name. - Get up here. - On you? - Yes. - Wait. Poltak, Poltak. Now what? What? - What is it? - Get down. - What for? - Just do it! - Me? - Get on! - Me? - Yes. - Is it okay? - Climb up! - Okay, then. - One, two, three. There! There! It really is Rudy's name! Come here. Come on. - What? - Just come with me. - What is it? - Get down. - What is it? - Rudy, climb on. - Just look! - Oh, God! You have to see it. Come on. One, two, three. There, Rud. Look! That one on top! Rud, look! - That one on top. - Where? Rudy! Second place! - Good morning. - Good morning, sir. What is the key to engineering? Accuracy, Professor. No. Go on. Calculation. No. PROBLEM SOLVING We are working ... ... to perfect the inventions made in the past. We are working to solve problems. So your project for this semester is ... ... to build a model. An airplane that can actually fly. Solve the biggest problems. Wait a minute. Stay here. Have you seen Rudy? - He's over there. - Oh, yes. Okay. Rudy. There's a congress for the establishment of PPI Aachen. We've received an invite. Want to come? Rudy. - Yes? - Rudy. PPI. Do you want to come? We need to join PPI like Mr. Zairin, our ambassador, suggested. Yu, you know. Here. I've found the facts that cause planes to crash. Here. I gathered these articles from newspapers from all over Europe. In some causes, I can't find the solutions. The first one is this. Air Traffic Control. There's a bird. Next, sabotage. Human error on the part of the pilot. And also hijacking. Miss Ayu, the class is about to start. - Alright. - Please. Wait a moment. So, are you coming or not? If I come to PPI, can I solve all these problems? This is for you. Even aerospace experts need to eat. Thank you. I have to go. Hey! 2 more minutes. My head is still full of soap. His face is so cute. Look. I think he's from the Philippines. You are so cute. Are you from the Philippines? How can he be Filipino? He speaks German. Yes, I forgot. I am from Indonesia, Ma'am. People from Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia, ... they all look pretty much alike. - Indonesia? Soekarno, right? - Yes. I am a student. Who plans to run a practice in Koln. How come you can speak German? Your country is very far away. My father was a cannibal. He once preyed ... ... on a German. That's why ... ... our whole family could speak German. IRON AND STEEL FACTORY Excuse me. Thank you. Hi, Indonesia. Are you reading German literature? Do you even understand it? Yes. It is hard. The most difficult in the world. Hi, Fritz. Come here. Listen to what this kid is saying. He said the most difficult language in the world is German. Fortunately, our kids were born here. Hi, Indonesia. How come your German is so good? Do you have German blood? My father was a cannibal. My house is on top of a tree. My Dad once ate a German. Since then, ... I could speak German. Perhaps all Indonesians are cannibals. Hi, Indonesia. Do you guys have cannibal parents like him? For years we fought the Dutch guerrillas in the jungle. Did you know that? Have you ever seen your friend or family member blown up by a grenade? Gus. I almost died defending our country. You are worse than a cannibal, Rudy! You're making our country a laughing stock for the Germans! As long as you are holding an Indonesian passport, ... you'll have to deal with us. Is that clear? I will never become a worker ... ... in my country, Mr. Helmer. I don't care what you want to become! Look at the work of that young man. Compare it with your own. He needs to work hard. For in Indonesia, he'll be a worker. Former soldiers like us, ... we will be supervising him. Thank you, Mr. Helmer. Hi, cannibal boy! Where are your friends? Those soldiers? It's so sad, men who live in a developing country ... ... behaving in such a backward manner. - You're still here? - Yes. Let me help you. The holes in this area have to be perfectly aligned. With the other holes as well. We need to test it outside. Hi, Mark. Look at what that cannibal is doing outside. Let's go look. You see this rope, sir? This rope will function ... ... as a flight controller. Hi, Mark. Come here. That cannibal boy is going to fly a plane. What? One. Two. Three. Rudy, good job! So this is the biggest problem. Wings. The connection between the wing and the fuselage. And the rear wheels as well. These elements always experience turbulence. During take off and landing. As a result, ... the plane may stall. Then explode and crash to the ground. Nice work, Rudy. Miss Ayu, Rudy is very smart. We would have an emergency if my mom comes. I suggest we hold the first PPI Aachen congress at Bad Godesberg. I agree! No, no. It would be much better to have it here. - It would cost much less. - Hello. Rudy. You all must be discussing the PPI? You said you're not interested in the organisation, Rudy? Now I'm interested. If I don't become the president, who will lead you guys? My grades are higher than all of yours. You're very arrogant, young man. Even my grandfather, who has been a soldier since the time of the Pharaoh ... ... is not arrogant as you! We were talking about the location for the first PPI Aachen Congress. What do you think? I think it doesn't matter where we hold it. What matters is the vision of the organisation. An organization without vision, it's like an airplane flying without a destination. Just like this paper. Blank. Without purpose. This is what we need to fill. Number two. If I become the leader of PPI, ... I will make PPI Aachen ... ... a benchmark for all PPI chapters in Europe. What do you think? Get in line! After we've counted the votes ... ... and determined majority, we now announce that the chairman of PPI in Aachen ... ... is Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie. Wait. Wait. Rudy Habibie will be assisted by Peter Manumasa ... ... as the secretary of the organisation. And Liem Keng Kie will be the treasurer. Thank you. No lectures, we're tired! You can open it. On these pages I've detailed the future of Indonesia. Wait, let me see. Rudy, developing an aerospace industry ... ... is not as easy as baking cakes. Yes, that's true. I know that. But I'm positive ... Rudy, why has this become about developing an aerospace industry? PPI is the Indonesian students association. - Not the aircraft association of Indonesia. - Right! I know. But remember, Indonesia is an archipelago. Yes, I understand. But why is it just about aerospace? We are supposed to be having fun here. What do you mean, having fun? Have you even read it? Rudy, just forget about it. It might be better for you to keep your idea to yourself or everyone will quit the PPI. Let's just have casual, social events. - What do you say? - Agree! For example, "Indonesian Evening". Visit the Alps or something. Most importantly, we have to form a camaraderie first. - What? - Sit! Guys, let's just find a place to meet first. I agree. We'll create a comfortable space where we can hang out. And pray, too. So Rudy doesn't have to pray under the stairs. Alright. I agree. I think PPI will be able to persuade RWTH to build a musholla. - Hey, man! - What? Do you mind? - Sorry. - Stop it. Sorry. I just don't understand the way you all think. What's wrong with the way we think? There are many Muslim students here and they have don't a place to pray. Erbakan, for example. All right, Rudy. We pray that your job will take you to heaven. I don't think it's going to be easy to convince them. You have to be patient with them, Rudy. They're here for the college experience. So, if you give them too much to deal with, they will back off. But every problem has a solution. Ideally, yes. What is it, Rudy? I have to go. This is the first time I've met someone like Rudy. Just wait. He'll keep on surprising you. Come on. Rudy. You need to share your intelligence with your friends. - Would you like to study in my apartment? - Come on, come on. Rudy is looking very handsome tonight. What do you girls think about this event? Panca is more handsome. Look. They're different, Mira. Rudy makes me curious. Looks like the Princess of Solo is falling in love with the genius. Very funny. Hi, Princess Solo. Here's your favorite desert, "sekotang". It's called "sekoteng"! - Same thing! - Why are you being so nice to Ayu? That's just who I am, Mir. I'm a very cool guy. Ayu, we look good together tonight. The color of your dress is so nice. Light purple. Poltak, this is light blue. I mean, bluish purple. Rudy, I heard you can speak French and Dutch. - Teach me, Rudy. - Come on. Yes, teach me. Well it's like this. A long time ago my father used to eat human brains. What do you mean? So he fed his kids human brains too. We got brains from Holland and from France. That's the reason why we can speak foreign languages. One of the hunters they ate was my uncle. He was Polish. But unfortunately, my uncle was mute. That's why Rudy's father couldn't speak Polish. - Right? - Right. This is my sister. Excuse me. Wait. Rudy, where are you going? Thank you for saving me from those boring girls. I'm Rudy. Rudy Habibie. Illona Ianovska, Medical technical assistant from Poland. My family took me to Berlin. So how did you end up here? My parents are friends with Mr. and Mrs. Neuefiend. We had dinner at their house a few days ago. We were waiting for you downstairs. But you just stayed in your room. How is it that you can speak Indonesian? It's a long story. My house was destroyed by a bomb, ... when the Nazis stormed Warsaw. I still have this scar. There was a nurse from Ambon. She was very kind. An Ambonese in Poland? Yes. My family and I stayed for months in a bunker with her. We couldn't tell the difference between night and day. My uncle almost went crazy. That nurse from Ambon was a good storyteller. She told me about her journey from Ambon to Poland. That's when you learned Indonesian? No. I didn't just learn the language, Rud. I learnt how to face fear in order to live longer. From there ... I learned that ... ... language is a window to see a wider world. And apparently, ... Indonesia will have a special meaning for me. Why is that? They have nice songs and dances. It's so fun, Rudy. - I want to buy some rice. - You can't, Ma'am. This is all you can get Ma'am. That's the price ... The line is long. We can't have meat today. - Yes, Mom. - Sorry. All prices have gone up. Mom, Tuti said that Rudy has graduated from Engineering. Is that right? Well, that means Indonesia will soon have it's own airplane. Not airplane. Indonesia already has airplanes. Rudy will build an aerospace industry. - Aerospace industry? - Yes, an entire Industry. - Is that Rani? - Looks like it. Where have you been? Mom's been looking for you. Rani! Oh, my God. Where have you been? What would I say if your father calls? It's okay, Ma'am. My dad is a cop. Meet my friend. Good afternoon, Ma'am. I'm Hasri Ainun Besari. You are Mr. Besari's daughter? - Good evening. - Good evening. Excuse me, Ma'am. Any messages for me? Yes. It's on the television. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Rudy, I just met Mr. Besari's daughter. Her name is Hasri Ainun. She's pretty. Kind and seemed understanding. That's Ainun. You said you don't like her. Prove it! Come on, prove it! Go on! All equations will be used? Ainun! You are dark and ugly. Something wrong, Rudy? It's okay. Wait a minute. Yes? May I see Illona? Let me guess. I think ... - Rudy. - Yes. I know now. Illona! Rudy is here. Hello. I need your help. Yes, okay. Come in, young man. Go ahead. Here you go. Thank you. With this letter, ... I would like to seek some advice regarding my education. What specialty does Indonesia need right now? Particularly in the field of aerospace. The Indonesian students and I, who are members of ... ... The Indonesian Student Association, will customize our fields of study. So that it will be useful to build Indonesia. What do you guys think? Can I have some? Are you sure your government will response to your letter? Are you sure that your friends are on the same page as you? Why do you ask that? I'm concerned, about your studies, Rudy. Coming up with this vision shouldn't be your responsibility alone. And now you're working on finding a meeting place, ... creating a prayer area, Indonesian Evening. But that's my way to make the others stay in PPI. I just want to be a fresh water spring. For my country, just like my Dad said. I understand, Rud. Newton created his theory in England. But it impacted the whole world. - Including Indonesia, right? - Yeah. You have to make them understand ... ... about your vision. I understand. I have to make them understand. And hold on. I need your help, Illona. Again. Ayu! Excuse me. Ayu. Yes? Can you come for dinner with me? I would like to invite you for dinner. - Well? - Okay. This is the address. See you there. Hi, Ayu! We're both matching again tonight. Both wearing red. How come you're here? Everyone is here. Come on in. Guys, look who's here! Ayu, please sit down. - Come here. - Come on. According to Newton's law, ... the pressure from hot oil will make the chicken very crisp, right to the bone. Newton got his inspiration from apples. I hope one day you will get your inspiration from food. Perhaps. Ayu, what's wrong? I have never smelled coffee this good! That's Rudy's special blend. A combination of German and Indonesian coffee beans. Did you really brew this? Yes, I did. You should give this coffee a name. - Rudy's Kaffee. - Rudy's Kaffee. Rudy's Kaffee. Rudy's ... Like this? Yes, right. Here are the sandwiches, just in case Rudy's chicken fails. Illona, do you have ... ... a younger sister who is good in Bahasa and can make coffee too? Rudy made that coffee. Unbelieveble. You're so good in school and now you make amazing coffee, too! Share your recipe with us. It's a secret. Then share with us your other secret. How you managed to get Illona? Even if I tell you, there's no guarantee you'll be able to practice it, right? Damn you, Rud. The chicken is ready. Ayu, are you not eating? No? Okay, listen. Listen. Why did I ask all of you to come here? I have an idea. This is a plan for the future of Indonesia. It's not only about the aerospace industry. It's also about fishery, shipping, and so on. Rudy, may I borrow it? Just a minute. And this is designed by the PPI students from all over Europe. Rudy, Rudy! We were happily chatting and enjoying the moment. Why don't you make some more fried chicken? - Wait. - Wait, Rudy. That's a big plan. Only a dream. Dreams! - Are you sure about this idea? - Absolutely. - I'm not sure I can agree with you, Rudy. - Why? Last week I received a letter from my mom. My uncle's shop in Jakarta was looted. They robbed and kept screaming, "Chinese!" Indonesia is like that now. Yes. Keng Kie is right. Now Indonesia is like this cake. Divided, gnawed by greedy people. The elites are more concerned with their groups and political parties. If the students across Europe ... ... succeed in designing the future of Indonesia ... ... to whom would we hand over this design, Rud? - Listen, Ayu. To whom ... - To those corrupt officials? We can decide that later. What's important now is for us to plan all this well. That's most important. We are all the children of the future. What's the guarantee? I am the guarantee. - You can't judge someone like that! - There's a reason why I said that. Because not everyone likes you! Yes, I can understand that. Okay. Let me say this once again. I am the guarantee. And I will not complete my graduate studies if this program is not accepted. Rudy! - Don't. - Yes. Don't! Right now, conditions are difficult, Fan. We must find another way so that you and your siblings can stay in school. Everything is not the way it used to be. Because of Rudy, right? Am I not your son too? Brother! Don't be like that. I want to join the navy, Mom. What's wrong, Rudy? Something bothering you? I don't know, I ... I thought I would get over this home sickness in two months. But ... It's been 2 years and I'm still home sick. Maybe your mother is thinking about you. Maybe. Have you considered my request? My petition? You know ... I think we need a proper place to pray. I agree. I would ask my Turkish friends to support your petition. But ... You have to involve my country as well. Why? I'm the one who made the proposal. Rudy ... We are all one. Islam doesn't only belong to your country. Yeah. Let's create another name. Which shows that us, Muslims, we ... ... are one family. How about that? Agreed. You're cheating! Come on, guys! We need to go to the congress. Come on, guys. Time to go. - Dimas! - We're late. Where's Rudy? Rudy, your plane is not the only thing that requires attention. - But your tie, too. - Yeah. You've been very busy lately. You cancelled our date to the opera. I didn't mean to cancel our date. Only, this is also important. Just as important as our relationship. Are you that serious about me? Sure. I believe in you, Rudy. You will not fail. - See you later. - Bye. It hurts, Yu? I've been in your shoes before. Shut up! Or go away! I choose to be quiet, If I can be quiet next to you. DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR PPI AACHEN FORMATION OF NATIONAL FRONT PPI HAMBURG EUROPEAN PPI CONGRESS I always emphasize to all members of PPI Hamburg. That students must ... Being a student is a privilege. Being a student is also a responsibility. As we all know. DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR PHASE I Ladies and gentlemen, we're now at the final session. Those of you not in favor of the proposal from PPI Aachen? Alright. 25 people. Plus one. What? Ayu? Those of you in favor of the proposal from PPI Aachen, raise your hands. 28 people. That means the European PPI Congress ... ... approves ... the Development Seminar program from PPI Aachen. Fellow students .... I'm representing the Indonesian government. I'm here to change the PPI mandate ... ... which originally supported the Development Seminar, ... now supports the National Front. Wait, wait. Sir, who are you? And where are you from? I don't know you. This is Mr. Irul. And as he said ... ... he represents the government. The mandate has been determined. It cannot be changed just like that. I agree. Where is this change coming from? The majority is in favor of Rudy's idea. You, ... we, all of you ... ... must support Mr. Soekarno ... ... to resolve the problems of West Irian. And your position in Europe ... ... is very important to provide support for Mr. Soekarno. To defend the dignity of Indonesia in front of the United Nations. I refuse. West Irian's issues have nothing to do with Indonesian students in Europe. Anyone who rejects the National Front ... ... is considered a traitor and must be punished! Do you understand, Rudy? Panca! - You don't need to pull out your gun. - On the contrary. Rudy! Please hear me out. Look at this. This tissue here is Indonesia's journey. Let me ask all of you. - What's the average age of an Indonesian? - What's that got to do with this? What is the average age of the population in Indonesia? 60 to 80 years, Rudy. Let's say all of us here support Mr. Soekarno. If the average age of the population in Indonesia is 80 years, ... then Mr. Soekarno only has less than 20 years. After that, then what? Who will take his place? Fact, problem and solution. The fact is that Indonesia is independent. The problem is, what comes after independence? The solution is ... the Development Seminar. Rudy Habibie. Rudy Habibie. Let's make this simple. - You want your seminar to take place? - Yes, obviously. I will oversee it from the very beginning. Especially with regard to the aerospace industry. Okay. Well then, we will give you that mandate. You can't do that. But the government will not support you at all, financially. Not even a penny. No problem! Let me tell you something. The Development Seminar ... will continue ... ... even without the financial support of the government. Rudy! Rudy, look. See that spring? You need to become a spring, Rudy. If you're good, everything around you will become good, too. But if you're dirty, everything around you will eventually die. There are so many people in this world. So many religions. Don't hurt them. That's the point. - Where's Rudy? - There. - What do you mean? - I doubt that ... Our bank account has increased. I was just about to say, we already got sponsors. Guys, we got sponsors! Keng Kie. Hello. - Hello. - Hi, Illona. - What is going on? - We need to talk with the others. I just watched a good movie. What is this? Agus and Mario went to the meeting place. They brought something from Irul. What does that mean, conditioned? They want us to put the Indonesian government name ... ... in brochures, pamphlets, leaflets, ... ... all our promotional materials as the main sponsor. I strongly reject this. No. Rudy, the risks are too significant. Let's not make them angry. I am not afraid. I don't think it's a big deal to put the name of our government in that event. Poltak, listen! This Development Seminar was not created for them. Our inspiration is the suffering of our people! Talking about the suffering of our people, my family is one of them. If I don't graduate, ... my parents will suffer at home. And just so you know, ... The Bandung Institute of Technology is forming its aeronautical engineering faculty. And they offered Keng Kie to become a lecturer there. If his scholarship is revoked, he will be finished. And they have the power to suppress us. Then we will fight back! I ... Rud. That's easy for you to say that because your passport is green. You are not a scholarship student. But our passports are blue. I will still send a rejection letter. Mr. Soekarno himself promised to support the Development Seminar. The development of Indonesia. I will collect on that promise. What is going on here? Don't you guys have another place to hang out? Ayu! Ayu! Who do you think you are challenging Mr. Soekarno? You idiot! I'm only defending the honor of Mr. Soekarno from the corrupt officials. Shut up! What do you know about the honor of the state? I'm defending the integrity of my country right now. What's the point being of independent without integrity? I'm proud of you, Rud. I've done my job by scolding you, Rud. Beyond that, ... that's my personal business. Continue your seminar. Don't be afraid. I will support you. But remember, ... you will reap what you sow. Thank you, sir. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR A FACADE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT! COUNTER REVOLUTION. Do you know the penalty of acting against the government? Your passport will be revoked at the least. At worst, you will be exiled from your country. Got it? - If we compromise even once ... - Rudy! - Peter! - Peter! All your passports will be revoked. Read it! Back off! - You can't do this! - How dare you! Do not embarrass our country! You are the ones embarrassing our country. Step back, Peter. Just because you're in the army, doesn't mean you can do whatever you want! Shut up! - Panca! - I said back off! I won't say it again. Bring them all here! Get in! Peter ...! Open the door! Open it! - Open the door! - Open it! Shut up ...! What are you doing? - Rudy! - Illona! Come on, shoot me. Shoot me now! Let's go. Rudy. It's okay. My heart is beating so fast. Where are the flyers? - Rudy! - Help me. - I need this. - Rudy! What are you doing? Rudy! - I have to hand out the flyers. - What are you doing? Rudy! - Think for a second! - Illona! Illona! Listen! This does not concern your country. This is about my country. I have to hand out the flyers. Thanks. I have to go there. I must help Rudy. - You can't, miss! - I must help Rudy. We're still on scholarships. Our hands are tied. I don't want you to lose your passport or your scholarship. - I feel sorry for him, Sugeng. - Please, Miss. Please, Miss. Come on. Thank you. "Come join the Development Seminar" Oh, my God! Rudy! Rudy! Help! Help! Please help me! Help me! Sweetheart. You look like you've seen a ghost. Hey. Rud ... You have bone tuberculosis, Rud. The doctor diagnosed it two days ago. Two days ago? Yes. You've been out for 3 days. Really? You need to rest. I can't. But there is good news for you. Your doctorate proposal was accepted. - Really? - Yeah. I don't want to rest. I need to ... Rudy ... - Slow down, Rud. - Please. Please, Rud. I ... I have to send the invitations to Prague and Berlin. Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. Everything has been taken over by PPI Hamburg. PPI Hamburg? PPI Hamburg? They're well prepared, Rudy. There is no other way. But the majority in PPI Hamburg are Panca's men, right? Yes. But this is the only way, Rudy. Peter will personally supervise the concept. - You know that ... - Listen to me. - That Panca ... - Listen to me. You know that ... Listen! Listen! Peter will supervise the concept. - Syafaril will give the opening speech. - No. Listen to me. Syafaril is fine. He attended every meeting. He's the most neutral. Remember that. And Peter is there, Rudy. Rudy, listen to me. The important thing is ... This is the only way, Rud. Sweetheart. Keng Kie. Let it go, we don't have a choice. On the contrary, we do have a choice. What? What is our option? What? We either have to compromise, or cancel the Development Seminar. I want to be alone. Please, Rud. Not a foreign oppressor. We desire to get rich instantly. Lazy, irresponsible. Our thirst for power and luxuries ... Remember the spring, Rudy. If you're good, everything around you will become good, too. But if you are dirty, ... everything around you will eventually die. "My vow!" "Fallen! Anger!" "My country, you're my motivation." Daddy! Mom? How come you're here? Why didn't you tell me that you're sick, Rud? I didn't want you to worry about me. In fact, you are now making me more worried. My studies ... My studies are a mess. And the seminar is ... It's okay, Rudy! Things are not working out. Rudy! Rudy! There's always another chance. The important thing now is to get better. Okay? Good morning, Miss. How may I help you? I would like to visit Rudy Habibie. I'm sorry, you can't, Miss. He's resting. You would like to give him these flowers? Yes. Let me pass them to him. Thank you. Ayu. Coffee, Miss. Where do you want me to put this? Please get me the list of all the PPI chapters across Europe. Hello. Rudy? Rudy! - Are you better now? - Peter. How are you? - You have recovered? - Yeah. - Sorry, I didn't get the chance to visit. - It's okay. - Hi, Keng Kie. - Rudy. How are you? Good, I hope. You're better now, Rud. I want you to meet someone. - This is my mother and my brother in law. - Poltak Hasibuan. Poltak. Poltak. That's Poltak. Welcome to Aachen, Tante. It's nice to hear Javanese here. Feels like home. You are home. Please, sit down. Sugeng. We have some souvenirs from Indonesia. Now you're talking. Poltak, here you go. Lets share with the others. This batik is gorgeous, ma'am. It's gray like meatballs. It's brown, not gray. And your language is rude. It is inappropriate for an older person. - Sorry, Ma'am. - It's okay. The color is perfect for you. Mira, come on. There are souvenirs from Indonesia, come take a look. This is nice. What do you think? Nice, huh? Development Seminar Phase II How is the shirt? Is it nice? It's very nice, Ma'am. I never thought batik could be as beautiful as this. - Ayu. - Yes, Ma'am? Do you know the girl in this picture? - Why, Ma'am? - Oh nothing. I would just like to meet her. Before I return to Indonesia next week. Is this Illona's house? Yes. Can I help you? Our family is a religious Muslim family. And right now, our country is going through difficult times. Rudy has to come back to Indonesia. If you are truly serious about my son, ... are you willing to move to Indonesia and convert to Islam? I need to say this now. So that there won't be a problem in the future. You don't need to answer right now. Excuse me. Wait. I don't need much time to answer that. I love Rudy. But I don't know if Rudy truly loves me. I'm prepared to convert and move to Indonesia for Rudy. But, does Rudy truly deserve my sacrifice? Come on, I'll be late. Rudy? Hi. Is Illona inside? She's out of town. I see. The submarine we have now ... ... is unable to dive to 300 meters. I need you to find the issues. Newton got his inspiration from appIes. I hope one day you will get your inspiration from food. Perhaps. A cylindrical submarine ... ... comes under greater pressure. That's why? A cylindrical submarine cracks easily ... ... at a depth of below 300 meters. Watch this. Compare it with a sphere. Very good, Rudy! Thank you. - Rudy. - Yes? Sorry, Ayu. We have good news from Romo Mangun. What is it? According to him, if all proposed division heads accept their duties ... ... and all agree, you'll be the leader of the aerospace division along with Keng Kie. We will build the aerospace industry, Rud. Mira! Why has this not been done? I want everyone in Eastern Europe to receive the invitation today! - Is that clear? - Still not finished? I know, right? You're lazy! Look, I'm not sure that I can come to Prague. - But why? - Rudy, what do you mean? This is your idea. - And you've been chosen by everyone. - Listen to me, Keng Kie. I don't want ... to keep seeing you all ... give in to Panca. Give in? Rudy, this is part of the strategy. Part of the compromise, not the strategy. Not again. Rudy, the last time you discussed compromise, ... remember what happened? - Look ... - Let's not talk about that again. - I have to go now. - Okay. I ... Rudy, if you disagree with our ways, then that's fine. But we'll still wait for you in Prague. I believe you're not going to give up. What is this? Prof. Ebner, what's this? I'm truly sorry I have to say this. You are considered a threat to the nation. What? Me? This is my work. Your country, Indonesia ... ... is not joining NATO. We do not want this work ... ... to fall into the hands of communists. What's that got to do with me? We are bound by duty ... ... to protect our nation's assets. But all of these ideas are mine. Not Indonesia! But your ideas were funded by Germany. This is not fair, Professor! Mr. Rudy. If you want your work returned to you, ... sign this document. We will give you a new passport. As a citizen of Germany. What do you say? You are the most intelligent person we have ever met. Be fair to yourself. Panca! Our master is here! Keng Kie! Rudy! Rudy! What is it? What? I ... I ... I cannot go to Prague. Don't give up just yet. Give up? - What is it? - You don't know? What? The Department of Defense has taken away my research. And do you know why? Because Indonesia is not part of NATO. Taken away? That's not fair. They can't do that. That's the fact. The solution: I'm not the right person to lead the aerospace division. - But you already have an engineers degree. - Keng Kie, listen. I have failed! Failed, Keng Kie. Failed, Keng Kie. Rudy! Rudy! I ... I have failed. I want to come home. If you return ... in these conditions, ... you will embarrass yourself, Rud. I have failed you and Dad. I want to come home. I want to come home, Mom. Remember what Dad said to you, Rud. I know it's not easy to be a spring that is clear and pure. If you stir murky waters, ... it will in fact, get more muddy. What you must do ... ... is to let the dirt settle. Be patient. I know you are strong. I remember ... ... when you took over for dad to lead our prayers. You ... Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! I know you have a strong heart. So, please remember ... ... do not forget who you are. I will always remember what you and Dad told me. I will make you proud. I will make an airplane for you. For Indonesia. What a wonderful evening. Illona, how's your Indonesian friend? Forget it. Good bye. Illona. Illona. Wait. Wait. Wait, Illona. What's going on? What? What do you want, Rudy? What else do you want? I think you should tell him the truth. Don't hide it. Sofia! Sofi! Wait! Illona, please. We can talk about it. Illona, let's talk. Okay? You ... have your own life, Rudy. - We can't be together. - Why not? We can't be together. Don't say that, Illona. Is this what your heart truly feels? Tell me. If she really wanted to leave me, ... why didn't she tell me herself? Why? She didn't only fall in love with you. She fell in love with ... ... everything about Indonesia. In every way. If you truly love Illona, ... you know where she is. Wait, Illona. No! Rudy! Everything in life has a fact, an issue and a solution. The fact is, I love you. The issue is, you've been avoiding me. The solution is ... No, Rudy. No. I'm the one who always believed in your dreams and ambitions! That's the fact and the issue! Illona ... Well, then ... let me find the solution in Indonesia. - Indonesia? - Yes. What will I become in Indonesia, Rudy? What will I become? Illona, You said it yourself when you were in that bunker. That your world is much bigger than Europe. Wrong, Rud. It's your world that is bigger than Indonesia. Then we have the same goals. We both want to be people without limits. The problem is where we start all this. I cannot face your family, Rudy! What? Wait a minute. I cannot bear to see you be treated so poorly by your people! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Indonesian people? My family? What are you talking about? I honestly don't know what you are talking about! Please, explain it to me! Rud, Rud, Rudy. If you want us to be together, ... then start from here. I ... I want to be a spring in Indonesia. Right. But start that from here. Make that water flow stronger and further so it reaches Indonesia. So it reaches your family, Rudy. Rudy ... If you want, we could build our own world. Meet me at the station on Monday. My train leaves to Bonn at 2 in the afternoon. I got a job at the hospital, Rudy. I will wait for you, Rud. I'll wait for you. Why are you praying here? We met before at the meeting place. I'm Romo Mangunwijaya. I'm from Yogyakarta. I went to RWTH as well. Architecture major, class of '60. Brother Romo ... If you want to use brother, call me Brother Yusuf. My name is Yusuf Bilyarta Mangunwijaya. Romo has the same meaning as Pastor. Romo, Pastor? Sorry, are you going to reprimand me? I borrowed this place ... to seek peace of mind. If all religious people were like you, Rud, ... we would no longer need a place of worship. God is bigger than a place of worship. Even religion. If God is bigger than religion, ... is it possible for a man to be bigger than his country? Not just country ... God created men of various types and origins. - Right? - Yes. The purpose is for us to understand each other. And to benefit each other. To love one another. In your religion, it's called "Fitrah." If the tendency of human nature ... ... is for us to benefit one another, ... then, where should I start, Romo? I just want to be a spring. Only you can answer that. Which one is more important? What you need or what people need from you? Remember, springs always push through the earth where the surface is cracked. - Romo? - Yes? Thank you. Rudy! You are the future. The new fighters for the growth and improvement of our economy. You have to study hard. You have to become doctors. Become engineers, physicists. And then, come back to your country. Sir. Sir! Is it true, what you said in your speech? That's Rudy Habibie from Parepare. A student at RWTH. Rudy, as long as I'm the President of Indonesia, ... I will build Indonesia to become a tiger within Asia and Africa. Come home. Don't stay too long in Europe. I'll collect on your promise. Yes. Dad, if you are from Gorontalo, and Mom is from Java, ... where do I come from? This is your Mom, from Java. This is me, from Gorontalo. And where is Rudy? This is you, Rudy. You are Indonesia. Excuse me. A man asked me to give this letter to you. Thank you. That's my vow. I wrote it while I was in hospital. Rudy? I thought you weren't coming. Rudy? I'm sorry, Illona. No need to apologize, Rudy. I understand the whole picture. The fact is, you love Indonesia. The issue is, you love Indonesia. - The solution is ... - I love Indonesia. I believe in Indonesia. And from you, ... I learned a lot. I saw how you loved me ... No, Rudy. In the end, my love wasn't enough for you, Rudy. My love will never be greater than your love for Indonesia. Take good care of yourself. And you, too, Illona. Take care. PRAGUE What do you say we take a picture together? - Good idea. Come on. - Take a picture? Of course. Sugeng, please take our picture. One! Two! Mind if I join in? Rudy! Sugeng, come join us. We can ask someone else to take the picture. Allow me to take the picture. Please. - Come here. - It's okay. Thank you. Three. This journey is far from over. I will never give up. I love Indonesia. I believe in Indonesia. And I will return to keep on fighting for my country. Ainun? Ainun?
