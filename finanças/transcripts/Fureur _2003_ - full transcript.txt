Sorry, you know this restaurant? That restaurant... It's over there. Thanks. You eat too much! We must talk to Mr Tran soon. He wants an answer. Sorry... The restaurant is closed. You speak Chinese? The restaurant hasn't opened yet. We're closed, go elsewhere. Look at him. Chinh? You're Noi! It's Noi! Chinh, it's your brother! Noi is here. Look! The same face as when he was a boy. Same nose, mouth, eyes. Even his look hasn't change. He's just older. - All those years without seeing you. - A big fellow. I can't believe it. Noi... You came from Thailand with just this bag? It's all I have. What did you say? You speak Chinese like a Thai! Put the bag down. Over there! I'll add a bowl! We'll all eat together! Don't forget: Dad's watching from up above. Let's go! He's 24!

Now let's greet a man in Manu's corner... A great champ of English boxing... Tonight he's here to be beside his kid brother. Let's cheer Raphael Ramirez! Tonight you'll see a sizzling fight between a Thai, a former World Champion, Kitti, and the Frenchman with boxing in his genes: His dad and brother were stars of English boxing. He has English boxing genes in his gloves. We'll see a great fight tonight! We'll be behind them all the way. May the best man win! The Ramirez kid won't last 2 rounds. Go on, Kitti! Don't rush in! There, left, right, middle. That's good, bro. Left, right, middle, simple stuff. Stay that way, lined up, don't rush in! Keep your distance, don't rush at him. Breathe deeply, Manu. 2nd round!

Don't lose this fight. Fighters in the middle! Mouthpiece. Fighters in the middle, please. Watch out, Manu. It's nothing. Doctor! - What is it? His eye? - Let me see, please. - I can't see. Is it deep? - Is it serious? - Can we go on, doc? - No, it's OK. Breathe! No elbows! Box! Hit him, Manu! You're the best! He's yours! Count, ref! In your corner! Hey, bro... When you let your right fly, it hurt him. That's real Ramirez stuff! - True, Ray? - You bet! Rapha... Look who's here! The Chinese delegation. Congratulations. You gave us a fine fight. You were very brave, Mr Ramirez. Very brave. Go shower, Manu! Rapha, you recognize me? Jo, he asks if I recognize him. Tony Tran! How could I forget you? As kids you beat each other silly! All that's past. Meet Chinh! My bride to be! Hello. Hello. She worried for your kid bro! Still got your garage, Rapha? You bet. The Ramirez got tough hides! Spoken like your Dad. Now I'm back in town, I hope we'll meet. Any time, Tony. We'll let you celebrate your victory quietly with your family. OK, Mr Tran. Rapha, where are you? Let's have some music! Where's Manu? That's my brother! You eat too much. Let me make the most of it. There's better things than eating. Tomorrow at the Tran's, when we discuss the wedding, remember to mention Noi's work-permit. If you wish. What can we lose? You must dare to bring it up. Yes, boss. Here we go! Stop playing We're about to eat! Let me finish, Mom. Kids, go wash your hands! Help me, Rapha! Dig that! I bash his brains, he doesn't move! He's nuts. Dude's incredible! He's a Thai. He's hungry! You can't imagine how hungry he is! What do you expect? Think he came to France for the ride? It takes that! But I sent him back to Thailand with this! OK you won, but who did you beat? A poor cab-driver who cut your eyebrow. Don't brag! OK, Rapha! Manu boxed well, don't ride him. Forget it, Jo! I'm never good enough for him, he smirks! - OK, you're the big champ! - Lay off me! Cut it out! You make me laugh! Ramirez kids! Break! I want him to be level-headed! You're level-headed? Shit, I'm not kidding... He's like our old man! Stubborn as a mule! I'm off. You're too rough on your brother. Manu. He's like Dad, gets mad right off! Why must he be so mad? What he needs is advice, an older brother who cares for him. But if you praise him, he sits back. Let me tell you... He boxed really well. He showed he has heart. Know where that chick lives? What chick? The one with Tony. I said, she's his private property. Hand off! Why's that guy back in town? I don't know why he's back... But please drop it, don't get mixed up in that. What if she lives in the hi-rise facing us? Maybe she's looking at me. You're really hot for her. Could be. If your mother could see you, she'd be so happy. Realize how lucky you are? Your whole family benefits from your happiness. And your brother will get a work-permit. All our hopes rest on you! What's she doing? Taking care of her brother. We're about to eat. Hurry! Don't loiter, it's time to go. - You hurry, too! - I'll keep at it. You take ages to iron a shirt. Stop singing! What's this for? To buy new clothes for when we visit the Tran family. Chinh! Do you really love him? Chinh! Noi! Are you ready? We have to leave! Hey, champ! - You've recuperated? - I'm fine, thanks. The champ! That's the latest model! - Real snazzy! - I just got it. Like it? - It's a beauty! - Go for a spin? Get in. We've got work to do, Manu! I said I need ya! Forget it. We'll do it some other time. Business OK, Tony? Can't complain. I've worked hard. I'm taking over from Dad. Know what we call your brother at home? "Will of Steel" "Will of Steel" It's awesome What do you want, Tony? Can we talk in private? We are in private! What an act! I hear you want to sell the garage. - Who told you that? - Locals. You know, the locals... You see a "For sale" sign here? Maybe I don't see well. You see any sign here? You're right, but your garage is falling apart. It won't last much longer. I came to make you a proposition. A very honest one. I need your space for my big project. Name your price. - What'll you pay? - Manu. - Just asking. - Stay out of this! You think it's funny. Listen, Tony. Nothing's for sale here. You got the wrong address. Don't get mad! Don't get mad and listen! If you don't sell it today, the bank'll sell it to me tomorrow. Once you've gone bankrupt. Who's goin' bankrupt? That's not nice, Tony. Don't talk crap. That's petty! Think your dough can swing anything? Why are you so hostile? It's an honest proposition. I thought... - You think too much, Tony! - Let's go, Tom. Too bad! Sure! Mind your crate driving out! If you change your mind, you know where I am! What's this about bankruptcy? There's none! Why not sell? You're sick of this damn garage. A guy who's loaded shows up, and you pass? Over my dead body he'll get my garage! Our garage, it's ours. "Buddhist altar" Sir, please take off your shoes. Thank you. Thank you, miss. Come pray to Buddha when you wish. Good health to you!

She can talk! She actually talks. Hey, you talk! Wait for me! How do you say "person" in Chinese? How do you say "pretty"? Mei Ren What? Mei Ren Mei Ren Very pretty person... You live here?

No, you don't. She's a real goddess! I wanna meet her, see what she's like! Not yet. I need more time. You running her in? Is it serious? Serious maybe, but complicated for sure. All I know is I'm nuts about her. What if... What if the offer, wasn't from Tony? Not that again! Think of other things! You think of other things! Again! - Hang in there, Ff! - Whatcha doin' here? - I gotta bring you my car. - Sure. Where you going? Gonna watch my bro. Left, right, move! Don't let him close in on you, Manu! Left, left, go on! Come show me! Let 'em slug it out! Not with the knees, guys! That's enough, Jo! Knees, head, feet. I don't want him to get hurt. - That's enough, Jo! - I said, quit that! Now hit him! I got work to do. Left, right. Left, right! Again! Hook! That's enough, Manu. Stretches, sit-ups, then a shower. - Manu's got a helluva punch! - Sure does. - Got a fight lined up for him? - Not yet. Hi, champ! Let's go, put some pep in it! No faking! You fooled me the other night. - You liked it? - It was great! And thanks for... - What? - I made a lot of bread! - No? - I swear it! That's enough guys. Let's quit. Manu! That'll do! Shower! Things OK? You don't talk to me anymore? I know, I'm upsetting your life. But I had to see you. I think of you all the time. I can't work! You understand? You mustn't try to see me anymore. Why? I'm going to marry Tony. Who's making you? Nobody. It's my decision. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. We have to stop meeting. I don't believe you! You're jealous! I've got something you'll like. Don't you want to open it? A 2-week temporary work-permit. Thanks, Tony. I'll give it to your brother myself. It's the start of his freedom. The rest... The rest will follow. Well? I'm tired, Tony. What do you mean, tired? I work early tomorrow. I'll go home. With me, you can stop working. Just say the word. - Let go of me. - Kiss me! Now what's wrong? What don't you like about me? Want me to change? To dress differently? What is it? Is it my smell? - My mouth? - No, Tony... - My cologne? - It's not that. What? What is it? I'm just tired, Tony! That's why you don't laugh with me? Because you're tired? I don't know. With Ramirez you have fun. - What? - You laugh with him. Don't deny it. I saw you! I know you don't love me, Chinh! I know you don't. But trust me... In time, you'll get to know me better. You won't be able to do without me. - You're drunk, Tony! - I'll make a princess of you. A princess! You're drunk. Maybe I'm drunk, but I love you. You'll love me, too. You need me! You're beautiful... But you'll catch your death dressed like that. Amazing! Who lives here? Nobody. Ramirez! Open up, it's Tony! Come down, Ramirez! I know Chinh's in there with you! Open this door, dammit! Look! Hold it, you! Manu! You're Ramirez? Mr Ramirez, I'm sorry but... Please, wait. I'm just doing my work. Please don't touch things. - Why, Chinh? - Calm down, Tony. Calm down. Take it easy I'll phone Tom. Stay with me! Please! Stay! What have you done, Tony? Where you going, dammit? Why him? Stay with me. Calm down, Tony! Let go of me! You're mine, Chinh. If you leave me, I'll kill you! I'll kill both of you. Calm down, Tony! Go on, Chinh! Go on! I'm not yours. I don't belong to you. Go on, kill me. Chinh! I'll kill you. Stop that, Tony! Hey, Get Tony out of here Calm down What's happened to you? What are you doing? Where are you going? You realize what you've done? You've made us lose face. You've gone mad! Stop! If you leave now, never come back here! I'm not for sale. Grab her! Hurry! Chinh! - Chinh! - I'll never go back to them! Calm down, little sister. Where will you go? Forgive me. Forgive me. If because of me, you don't get your work-permit... Forgive me, but... I don't love him. Not one little bit. Don't worry about me, I'll find a solution. Rapha, someone for you. Chinh... My brother, Manu. Sorry, it's a real mess. The cleaning lady's sick. It'll be OK... Don't worry. Know what my mom used to say? Only sickness and death are serious. Where are you going? Stay, now that you're here What's going on? What's happening to you, Chinh? I know who did it! You know what? What are you saying? I know who did it. - Who are you talking about? - Tony. Tony Tran? What are you saying, Chinh? That creep burned down my garage? He did it? How do you know? How do you know he burned down my garage? Is she Tony's chick? - Where you going? - I'm gonna waste the fucker! Sure, waste all of Chinatown! He burns the garage and I bend over? You touch that bastard, we're dead! Calm down. You can't fight him without proof! Let the insurance handle it. And lay off that chick! Leave her out of it! How can I? Why did Tony burn it down? You tell him! It's because you're screwing his woman! - Shut up, Manu! - I won't! I've babied you for 15 years! You won't teach me life! Sure, play dad to me! I'm your dad, your mom, I'm everything! What do you do for me? 3 oil-changes a week at the garage! Who pays for your fight training? Does the dough fall from the sky? - You get off on this? - Shut up! It's over! Dsir. - I gotta talk to you. - This is no time! Shit! About your offer... Not here. You crazy, Manu? - Pay up! Pay up! He drives me nuts! He wants trouble! Dirty fucker! So? What do you want? OK! Tell me what you want? See how I screwed him! Well? I need bread, and fast! Help yourself. That's what I won. I need a lot, I mean it. A lot? A lot! What's a lot to you? You said to see you if I had a problem. - How's your brother? - Can you do it or not? Where ya goin'? Come here! How long have I known you, Manu? Since you were a little kid. I said if you got a problem, I'm your man. So it seems you got one. I'll say it again. You can count on me. But I warn you... If you go into this, you go all the way. You can't back out. You understand that? We'll be a great team, you and me. You were right to come. We're gonna do it. Relax! Relax! Where's your scumbag son? I'm talking to you. Out of my way! Come here! I'll rip your head off! Hold it! Go on! Get back to work! Fast! - He said get to work! - You, too. Back to work. I won't say it twice. Don't play dumb. You listen to me! Get Tony to my garage before I find him! Or else! I tried to negotiate with him... I tried. He wouldn't hear of it. He wanted to put me down, by taking Chinh! So you burned down his garage? His garage? Yes, his garage. What I wanted to do was to kill him! You bear a name, my name, a respected and respectable name. You've made me lose face. Because of people like you our community has a bad reputation. After the Tet festivities, you'll leave for Shanghai. Forget this girl, my son. She has made her choice. I won't leave. You'll leave before this gets worse. My decision is irrevocable. You'll leave for Shanghai. I won't go to Shanghai! You can leave now. Hello, Mr Ramirez. You listen to Asian music? I think an amicable solution would be welcome... To ease things between you and my son Tony. Of course, you're free to file charges against Tony. But I'm convinced no good will come of it. Not for you, or for me. So... Here's a signed check. Just write in the sum. And the matter is settled. Let's shake hands. - What is it? - He's with me. Lai, search him! It's cool, Manu, let them do it. They're clean. Let's go, Manu. I warned you! This isn't sport. The rules are simple. Unlimited rounds. You can hit a guy who's down. If he can stand, the match goes on. Another thing, if you want to give up, if you ever do, you raise your hand. OK? Where are the gloves? What gloves? This is Burmese boxing! What's this audience? Take a look! The fights are seen live on the Internet. Worldwide! If you smile, they'll bet on you! Go get ready. - Where, here? - Sure, go over there. Go on, hurry! - How much do you bet? - 50! That's not enough. - Then 60. - So how much? 70? OK, 70 grand! - 70's all right, - OK. 70 grand. Half now, half later. If you win, you get double. That OK? Concentrate, get ready. Don't let me down, champ! What's that scar? I was just a child... Really young. Noi was 10. Noi did that? No. Fleeing to Thailand, a piece of shrapnel hit us both. Besides Noi, it's all I have from Cambodia. I thought you were Chinese? Yes, I'm of Chinese origin, but my whole family was born in Cambodia. After Cambodia, I lived in Thailand with my brother. Then I left alone for China. Now I've been in France for 5 years. Quite a mixture! Pretty, isn't it? Very pretty. Move out! Get Up! Get Up! You've hurt him, you've got him. Don't play his game. Use your fists more, that's how you'll get him. When you break from a clinch, watch out for his elbows. Finish him off! Finish him off! Come off the ropes! Raise your hand! I beg you, Manu, come to! Come to, little champ. Manu? It's open. You drunk, or what? OK, I'm coming. Well? Still mad at me? You really tied one on. You're really ripped! Do I have to carry you? What happened? Who did that to you? Who did that to you, bro? Talk to me. What's that? Hey, bro! Where ya goin' bro? What's happening to you? Hold on, bro! What ya doin' to me? Wake up, Manu! You're a Ramirez, wake up! What the fuck ya doin'? Wake up, Manu! You'll catch cold. My bro! Little bro! Manu! Forgive me. Forgive me, Manu. Forgive me. Manu! Forgive me. Forgive me, Manu. Forgive me. Tom! Go! Has Chinh driven you mad, Rapha? Tony, what are you doing? Calm down! Calm down! I'm OK, Dad! - Take it easy - OK! Stop Damn it! Calm down What's going on? I don't know, Dad! I know what happened. What do you know, Tom? Go on, translate! That kid went for illegal fight! The Burmese Boxing My bro! Little bro! Translate for Rapha! Translate for Rapha, he wants to know the truth. Go on... Be gutsy! Translate! Tell me. He says... that your brother... agreed to an illegal fight... to earn money. And the rest, Chinh? Keep going! Rapha will love this. Tell him the rest, please. He says... it was Noi, my brother who fought Manu. - No, no. - Tony, let go of her! Let her leave! Tony! Let go! Calm down Are you crazy? Get outside and calm down Let' go It's for us, sister. Now we're free. You killed someone. What do you mean? I didn't kill anyone. The only solution was that fight. You killed! You killed someone! For money! I didn't kill anyone. It was a fight. He's dead! You killed his brother! Let's leave. Let's leave fast. Let's leave. To go where? Calm down, Chinh. Calm down. Fight me! Fight me! Show me! Is this what you did? Show me! Show me what you did to him!
