Where was the old mental hospital, remember? It was over there. That one there? There's the church that's inside. They made it a church afterwards... Poppy was the matron. We had a good time but the mice ate... What did they eat? Did they get in the beds, the rooms? In the beds. What did they do in the beds? Our ears... They bit our ears. They bit our ears. - Who did? - The mice did. We left and we went up because it smelt of shit. It smelt of shit. The Greek Film Centre and Stavros Psillalkis present The man who disturbe the universe I remember they brought me at midnight, at night. I was a just kid. They cut my hair, gave me a bath and brought me... ...my husband. How I made it I don't even know... how I made it then. I don't remember why or how. This thing came out of my thoughts, my incoherence... Now I'm making this man and the statue itself... ...will show me what form to give it as I work. I can hear voices in here. - Our voices, Manolis. - What a lot of voices. You find a 1000 bill, you take a picture of it, a film... ...you make money afterwards. My head's empty. I don't know what I have. I don't know what's wrong with me. And the widow loved me too much. She accused me of attempted murder and I ended up in jail. One year of my prison term I spent in the mental hospital. The rest of my time I served in Halicarnassus Prison. Written and directed by Stavros Psillakis Every time I talk fast they tell me to talk slower... They say they don't understand. It's a problem I have. But you tell me when a sprinter is running the 100 metres... ...just before he finishes, is it easy to stop him? The Souda Mental Hospital is over here. The Ministry of Health and Welfare Mental Hospital. The Chania Mental Hospital is over here. Here we're all sick, I'm also sick. They say I should become a minister. I don't like it. What we have in here, in this place, in non-existence. There is no time or space. Nothing matters. There is only a burning cigarette and a coffee. Things that are easy outside are the hardest inside. From the moment we wake up we search for coffee and a smoke. I love my madness. I really like it. I may take medication but nothing's changed in my mind. The people who locked us up lost their dignity, but not us. I'm a guy who belongs here. I've been institutionalised... I don't know... but I come here and I rest. I consult. It's my own Mount Psiloritis. There the mountain is of stone... ...not steel like the Eiffel Tower or the New York skyscrapers. Stone, stone, stone, the earth is stone. It's not a gun, or the nucleus of a man nor anything else. The first men fought each other with stones. The last, the fourth world war will be fought with stones. I've finished. I'm 38 years old. I was born, grew up, went to grade school... ...learned to read and write, then learnt a craft. I worked non-stop. But in 1982, I was in a traffic accident... ...and I remember nothing. My nerves were shot and I've been in hospitals and mental clinics ever since. But I have no complaints. Alcohol contains toxic substances called toxins. They affect the nucleus of the cells and with the fission of the nucleus cause explosions... ...and that's what a drunk feels. I told my nephew and he told me that's how it is. Shoot it, please, the whole shot, don't lose it... Show the 1,000 bill burning. It's a piece of paper... say I lost it or gave it away... Shoot it, it's a symbol. Can you hear the sound? Tell me if you can hear the sound. Can you add sound? Do we have sound? Can I speak? For the same reason I burnt a 5,000 bill once. I feel this place like the Pnyx or the Acropolis... It's like the army in here. Certain hours we have to spend inside the ward. We drink our milk and medicine and then come straight here. Look, in the wards we can be beaten up... Here, there's harmony. In the morning, you see the place is full. All the mental patients who are not confined... ...come here to wheel and deal. They converse with each other. They handle their beauty and their relationship well. The speech barrier breaks. You need it. You heard about psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, I mean... ...it's very important to talk. It's what I do. It's what everyone does. Some ask for money and others ask for speech. It's the same thing you understand. In here we're a small Vatican, a state within a state. I call it a citizens' Assembly, of the Mental Hospital. We don't adopt resolutions here but we could in the future... at a time when patients would have greater support... this could be a meeting-place. The rehabilitation programme began in 1990. The reasons that led us to initiate these efforts... was the situation prevailing in mental hospitals and out own. There are around 400 patients, 2/3 of which are chronic cases. Most of them are confined, abandoned... They remain in mental hospitals for 5, 10, 15, 20 years... ...they are deprived of basic social and political rights... It's very nice in here. Even if you're sick, you get well. The 5 cooperative units are aimed at professional training... ...of the group, and the assurance of... ...relative economic independence for social reintegration. Take a photo of me here. I make people with my eyes. Understand? I have good vision and I can make whole figures. Really. People who have been institutionalised for years... ...are systematically prepared for their release from institutionalised passivity... ...and for the re-structuring of their lost personality. The patients who work in the co-operative units... ...or stay at the Programme's rehabilitation shelter... ...don't cease to be mentally disturbed. Psychiatry today cannot find the causes of mental illness. It can't even define it properly. What is required is that the patient be socially viable... ...and disruptive behaviour will be socially absorbable. The criteria for patients to live outside... ...is not their mental illness or obsessive ideas... ...but their behaviour. If it is absorbable, they will be fine and may never need a psychiatrist. I had nothing to do and I did something rash. I couldn't sleep and went for a walk to the cemetery. For a joke, I decided to take a coffin lid to the cafe. At night, I carried it to the cafe and stood it by the door. When they saw the coffin lid, they were panic-stricken. The woman who owned the cafe almost fainted. I did it on purpose, before they did something bad to me. I thought of putting in a sheet and sleeping inside... ..but I didn't do it. When you paint, you don't think about the price... ...it's irrelevant. I paint because of a whim, it's a labour of love... ...a hobby, irrespective of money. When I paint while drugged, it has a special value. It's one thing to be healthy, and another to have problems. What can I say? It's like a neighing of the horse in 3 stages. I'd say that... I define the untamed nature of women... Something like that... I really don't know. I imagine the naked female body like something... ...that reminds me of mother earth, our earth. Things turned out differently than I imagined. We said that Christ is always crucified. Maybe all painters are like Christ... ...carrying a cross until the end of their life. So that His picture can always exist. As society is today, I don't know what else to say. I don't like chicken, barley pasta, soup... chicken soup... I don't like anything. I committed a crime in my village. I strangled my little brother and attacked my mother. We say that people confined for years in mental hospitals... ...have lost everything except their minds. They have lost basic human rights and personal freedoms... ..which, if a person lost, he would die. A sense of personal space, of time, of life's aims... ...of personal desire and personal taste. They can't choose their food and have no personal space... ...to put their personal effects. It would drive us insane. The first point we made was a critical stance towards the asylum and institutionalised care. The methods and approach to insanity seems almost insane. After 15-20 years of treatment, we have to remedy what we caused in the patient with the therapy. What we do is almost senseless. To confine insanity is like trying to put a large box in a small one. It's impossible. That's why we've reached a deadend. Don't take pills, don't take pills. I didn't expect to be brought from Souda to here. The rooms were small there, men and women were separated... ...and it was filthy, with rats and cats. We also went to the sea, it was close by. The Rehabilitation Programme has three sections: The Re-integration Unit operating within the clinic... the Cooperatives outside, in places with social life... ...and the Remedial Apartments in the city where they stay... ...forming the basic cell of their new reality. I've been in and out of the mental clinic since 1978... ...without good reason. I was depressed, and had no-one to talk to or give me advice. I never had a father or anyone. I don't want to fool myself, but l had a defect. I was young, at school, and I came to the clinic. It was good for me, because I needed therapy... ...but what can I say? It's a jungle there. Rehabilitation begins when the patient is diagnosed... ...and the psychiatrist is obliged to deal not only with the symptoms, but with the repercussions of the illness. We have to plan the therapy so that we can tell patients... not only what medicine to take, but how to earn an income... ...have social relations, friends, and perhaps a family. These things will support them. Five years ago, they only used spoons. They had forgotten how to use forks. When patients went outside after 20 years... ...they didn't know what a red light was... ...how to use money, phones or public transport. It's as if they're beginning to walk by themselves again... ...to learn about life, step by step. We see those steps, that effort... ...to get to know themselves again in a social setting. We see resistance from the community... ...as well as tenderness, support, love and acceptance. The Fifth Season Cafe is a season that doesn't exist... ...but we all understand this season... ...because it is inside us and we believe it will blossom. Whenever we organise an event, we make new friends. Should we raze the walls to go outside... ...or expand them for the rest of you to come in? Freedom was born in Athens, at the citizens' Assembly. Freedom is repressed and violated in here... ...in the Mental Clinic Assembly. Freedom is a limit. In Greek, the word "freedom" comes from "I will come". And always remember... I worry about those who worry about me. I don't know beautiful words and if they're for me, don't bother. Let me stay where I am without trying to change me. I'm broke and lonely and I love you because you're elusive. What can I say, my mind's empty. I'm carving "I love you" on my arm. I can't not see you, or not wait for you and you can't follow my own escape. It's a fact there's no immortality let St. Peter become ill, so we'll live another year. If You were a drinker, Lord, mankind would be saved. if You'd knife Death in Your drunkenness. Listen to the nightingale singing in the trees... I've lost myself for 20 years. I don't remember who I was. They shackle me with chains, locks, handcuffs. They've shackled my soul. Who? The demons. Satan, Beelzebub. the dragons, gnomes, goblins, fairies... the demons and dark powers have got me. Why do you think that? They bring me the thought. - Who? - Those... the devils. - No, they don't exist. - I wish they didn't. Whoever can tell me why my soul is shackled... I'll make him rich. I'll go to China... ...where you can get a big piece of solid gold for $10. I'll make him rich and I'll worship him... ...for a thousand billion years, a thousand billion light years. There is chaos in my mind, a black silhouette... ...and a strange light, and chaos. Oh, mother, mother, mother... Sometimes it turns this way, then... What's the matter with me, my God, my God... ...If you speak to God, you're praying. If God speaks to you, you're schizophrenic. When we describe behavior in religious language... ...we legalise it, when we describe it in psychiatric language we make it illegal. In the human kingdom, the struggle for definition is really the struggle for survival. Under the chaotic raving of the lunatic... ...rules the class of a secret raving. His words are the crust of a deep sea. Translation is necessary, but there is no translator. A person's clash with madness, a dramatic clash... ...involves profound desperation and absolute doubt... ...about every aspect of "being". The person feels he has nowhere to return. He "is" no more. He "was". Just as death surrounds our life... ...so does lunacy linger around our mental health. The completely normal person only closes up inside him... ...the body of the murdered lunatic. You take only one drop from the ocean. I've been experiencing it for 20 months... ...apart from the years I've spent in here. In here, it's life and you know why? Have you seen a river? It flows. The world. There are swamps, but inside, there is much more life. In stagnation there is movement... and in a crush there is wealth. Are you a journalist? Let me hold it. Let it go. It's soft. Take a photo of me now. Mum, call me at the kiosk in 2 minutes, OK? No, not 10 minutes, in three. I can't talk on the mobile. Call me in 3 minutes. Bye. I see you, you've got cute little teeth. Now, I see Makis and Akis and the camera. I see the palm tree now and it has nuts. The palm tree will make nuts. - Michalis, I see you. - Oh, go away! I'll see God. The plum tree. I saw God. I see the sun. It's like a sea urchin. The sun is like a sea urchin, with rays. Can Manolis see a bit too? Can you see the sun, Manolis? The boys? What's that is there? I see trees, the yard. What beautiful things! Beautiful surroundings. Oh, beautiful trees! Like the cinema. There's a number high up. Go towards the gate please, close together, like that. Keep moving, talk... Lean on the railing. Hi, Michalis, do you mind us playing with the camera? I want to give you a cigarette, Michalis. Haris, how are you? Are we going on an excursion? Where's your face, Haris? Smile, Giorgos, you're the most important... ...after our medicine. Shave off your moustache, so your smile shows. Don't you know that a "pansy's" veil is his moustache? What's your name, my friend? Don't you have one? You've got a nice smile. Did the mouse take your teeth? - Who do you want to hear? - Costas. - This Costas? - Yes. How are you. Costas? - When will we get out of here? - Patience, Manolis. - As long as we're healthy. - Yes. And you, boys, be healthy too! - Thank you. - You're welcome. There are more crazy people outside than in here. Here, they're sane. They want to eat, to sleep... ...but outside, they're digging each other's grave. You find more understanding in the hospital than outside. Outside, if I ask someone for a cigarette... ...he looks sulky. But in here... ...if I ask anyone, they'll give it to me. In 1996, the first nine members of the Re-integration Unit... ...accompanied by five members of the support team... ..went to Denmark for one week. For most of them, passports, foreign currency and aeroplanes... ...were unknown or long-forgotten stories. I'm Michalis Vourlidakis from Iraklio... ...and I'm travelling by plane to Denmark... ...with the others from the mental clinic. I was born in Egypt and stayed till I was 15. Nasser took our assets and kicked us out. Some went to Switzerland, America, Australia... ...but we went to South Africa. I finished school there and found my husband... ...I married there and had children. I'm from Rethymno and my mother's from Alpha... ...where a famous lyre-player lived. My father's from a village in Rethymno county. I grew up in a carefree way, I went to school... ..and I was very close to nature, to hunting and fishing. Then I completed an electronics course and came to Athens... ...and you know the rest. I have something pleasant to announce. During the trip, a big love was born... ...and tomorrow Stella and Spyros will be engaged. Come here. It's not right to be sulking for two days. That's it. I don't want to discuss this anymore. You'll sit together and drink your coffee. I loved her right from the start. We walk to the port, to Hania, and drink coffee. That's why I love her. Has a woman ever caressed you the same way twice? That's love, it constantly creates. It's fire, a nuclear explosion... ...irrespective of whether only a few aristocrats... ...survive the explosion. Love is not aristocratic. Both rich and poor have the right to fall in love. Love is not defined like time. My tragedy is that I won't have kids... ...because I'm schizophrenic, I won't have kids. There is a better one for 400. - How much is this? - 200. I can't see a woman suffer. When she's unhappy... ..and can't bear it anymore, I'm upset too. With my first girl-friend. I took things differently. I felt I like a man who'd been married for years... ...and never wanted to separate. "It was a very constructive trip, beyond imagination”... "...and was possible because of you." "Thank you from us all. Yannis Papadakis." "I'm sending greetings and love from Denmark." "We'll be back soon. Spyros." "Greetings to my friends in the Re-integnation Unit." "Bourlidakis. Aalborg. August 24, 1996." They made an amazing escape... ...from the asylum time, and compressed... ...a wasted time, a time they didn't live... ..and they want to squeeze into that short time... ...so many luscious things, which they never did. You're scared aren't you? Time is a big problem in mental illness. My life was somewhat planned before I went crazy... ...because for a while I played chess alone. After my illness and after my father's death... ...my time became unlimited, it pressures me. Just as Cronus eats his children... it pressures me. Here, time passes... and when I sleep, I'm well... ...but when I wake up, I can't plan. Unlike you, with obligations, something to create... Do lions in a cage plan their time? It's something like that. Don't forget that no-one defines time. I was born in 1857 in Iraklio, Crete. I spent my childhood in my mother's village... ...then returned to Iraklio. I stopped high school because of marriage and pregnancy... ...but after my divorce. I finished high school... ...and studied midwifery, which I completed. Later, I worked and then I had problems sleeping... ...so I consulted a doctor and a priest. They excited me about women, but I never saw any. I was 16 and I was restless. I wanted to enjoy life, but I messed up. Although I was young, I became a sailor. Upset and sad, I travelled very far away. I was fine in South Africa, but became ill here. I went to a psychiatrist, who gave me pills... ...but I got worse and ended up in a mental hospital. Doctors give you injections, without you understanding it. They give you an injection to feel good... ...but you feel terrible afterwards. A moment of joy becomes a lifelong breakdown... ...just because of an injection. My potential dropped and I landed in a well. It was very deep. The light of lunacy. I'm at the edge of the well, trying to get cured... ...in a well with slippery footholds, no rope, no-one. That's how we all are in here. I'll get out, even if I don't know what to expect. "The Light of Lunacy" is a good title... ...but lunacy is sub-dimension of light.. Christ said: "I am the Light." "Whoever follows me shall not be in darkness." I didn't go to school, I came here in short pants. I don't know who I am, nor how to go back home. My father died, my stepmother's alone... ...and my sister comes to see me. You can be discharged, but it's too early for me. I'm not in a hurry, because it was too early... ...when I'd been discharged before and I came back. I don't like it anymore in the village. What can I do there? I'm used to being here. You haven't become institutionalised... but if I go there, the laughter... I liked a girl there, we went out together. We were friends, now she's in her country and I'm in mine. We were happy together, but she loved someone else. We were just friends. I was born in a big house. We had property. Now the house leaks. I can't go to the village now. The house is too big for me. "You re not doing anything new, you're just continuing... ...the work of your predecessor, whether father, film director... ...brother, friend, or someone who's gone. Six of my friends have suicided because of insanity. The girls wear white ribbons and look at the boys, who wake early. But I don't mind, nor does my heart ache, no-one knows who you love. I an tenderness. I am the tear from the eyelash. I am the man who disturbed the universe. We are us. A drop of water in the ocean is bigger than the universe of the earth... ...and we help, we help the dusk. Beauty, my God, life, my God. It's as if mentally disturbed people... ...are an offering to others... ...so the rest can manage. Insanity is interwoven and identified with human existence... ...it is inside it and that's why... ...it cannot be exorcised or expelled... ...and whoever tries to subjugate it, to cure it, pays very dearly. Simply, at this time, the murderer thought: "Will the Furies or justice choke me?" "The Furies," his friend replied. What Furies? What was the crime? Here, a woman was raped for two cigarettes. And here the road, which isn't an avenue... ...but a path, trodden daily by thousands... ...with their labour, their sweat, forgive me Lord. I pray occasionally. Now I'm walking, I'm a child. The finest human essences are linked with insanity. To approach it, you must develop... ...familiarising mechanisms, with a rhythm... ...and a way of behaviour in relation to these essences. You drink and get drunk, you have to get drunk that day... ...and you know why you get drunk and how intoxication comes... ...naturally inside you and you're willing to get drunk. This willingness in relation to insanity must become natural. "Sun, my great easterner, golden cap of my mind..." "I like to wear you askew, I like to play." "As long as you live, as long as I live"... "...I like the earth, like the curly grape." "I crave the light like the olive tree"... "...and the pine, and time is hacked to pieces." "Coolness, coolness, and time is hacked to pieces." What hunter maimed you, my sweet-sining nightingale...? "I'll wage war with God to take away his angels"... "...and leave him alone with damned Death." "God and Death are the same thing"... "...and may they both die, so nothing's left." I love the mental hospital and if I stay outside longer... ...I may even miss it. If I leave, I'll have many memories of it. The people are warm and good, even in their violence. You see people fighting, then shaking hands. I imagine your film is finishing now. Finish with a sentence that will be touching... ...and as it is heard, the screen will fade and go black. And instead of "The End," put "To be Continued." Will you remember that? "I am tenderness. I am the tear from the eyelash." "I am the man who disturbed the Universe.”
