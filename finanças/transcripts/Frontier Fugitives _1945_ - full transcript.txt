[ Man muttering] Well, what are you trying to do, panhandle? Don't you get it, Dave?Sorry. You understand, don't you, Tex? Sure. You're giving an imitation of a razorback hog stuck in a barbwire fence. [Laughing]That ain't it at all. We're near Indian country, ain't we? Well, I'm practicing talkin' Indian. Throwing up smoke signals, practicing sign language. Oh, we were only kidding, panhandle. Understood every word you said. Didn't we, Dave?Sure did. And you're dead right. We've got to be prepared. We'll hold a council of war right now. The first thing we'd better do is see Allen fain, the new Indian agent at bear settlement. We'll learn more about the trouble from him. People find out the three strangers are lawmen, we won't find out nothing from nobody, especially about who's killing the trappers and Indians. Panhandle's right again. If we're going to solve the mystery, we've got to work undercover. Let's figure it out while we're riding. [ Gun clicks ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gun clicks ] [ Gun clicks ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] I'm sorry I hit Fred, but he shouldn't have let himself get caught. Wouldn't do for anybody working with you to tell what they know, would it, donner? Not if they expect to stay healthy, sneed. Drop those guns. Drop those guns on the bunk. You're under arrest, stranger. What are the charges? Murder. For shooting that Indian. Did you see me shoot him? I caught you leaning over him with your guns in your hands, and that's enough for me. I didn't mean to bust in on an argument. I just wanted to inquire the way to bear settlement. If you can make a deal there, maybe he'll let you ride along. Oh. You the sheriff? No, I'm Allen fain, the new Indian agent. Uh-huh. Looks like you captured yourself a desperate character, Mr. Fain. What'd he do? Killed that Indian in cold blood. He more than likely belongs to the band of men that's robbing the trappers and Indians of their furs. He doesn't look much like a killer to me. If he was, he wouldn't let you capture him. There's a good reason why I'm letting him take me in. He's got me covered. I see. I didn't kill that Indian. And you can do me a big favor, if you will. Get word to chief tall wolf panhandle that I'm in trouble. If I run into him. I'm not going out of my way to run your errands. I'm heading for bear settlement. Follow the south fork of the stage road down through the valley. Oh, um, you better keep your eye on him. Come on, let's go. [ Horses approaching ] He's dead. Did he say anything before he died? Yeah. He kept mumbling something about a wildcat and his daughter Ellen. That his daughter Ellen was a wildcat or something like that. Let's go get the sheriff. I ain't fond of hanging around a corpse. I'll take care of the sheriff. What else? He said his cabin was over that Ridge. Say, maybe his daughter is a female catamount and she's in that cabin. Let's go. I ain't seen a wild woman for ages. I'll take care of the lady. I thought you was going to take care of the sheriff. I'll take care of both. I've got something much more important for you to do. Do you remember how impressed I was when I heard you talking Indian? Yeah. Well, that's it. What? You're going to be chief tall wolf. And I know where there's an Indian scalp you can wear. Good.a dead Indian. Now, wait a minute, Dave. I don't mind you leaving me here while you go for the sheriff, and I don't mind you going over the Ridge to see the lady, but if you think I'm going to be a dead Indian chief, you've got another think coming. Not a dead Indian, panhandle. You'll be very much alive. [ Laughs ] Take a look in that trunk. There's nothing in there. Put up your hands. All right, reach! [ Fighting sounds ] Whoa. Hold it. I thought you was on your way to bear settlement. Well, I am.This is not the road to the settlement. I got lost on the way and stopped to ask directions. Every time you stop, you start something. You had better be cellmates until I can check up on you. I guess it was my fault he got in the fight. Thought he was one of mert donner's men. Who is mert donner? I haven't any proof, but I think he was after my father's cache of furs, and i-- go ahead and talk, miss. This is Mr. Fain, the new Indian agent. I'm Tex Haines. He thinks I belong to donner's gang, but he's wrong. I have no idea who this is. Hello. I'm Dave Wyatt, but that's not half as important as who is the young lady? I'm Ellen Williams. This is my father's cabin. What makes you think those men were trying to steal your father's furs? My father thought they were. That's why I left to their hiding place. Maybe they were trying to steal them. When I came in, they were searching the cabin. Don't you think you should offer the young lady your protection?That's right. Maybe you'd better ride to the settlement with US until we can locate your father. Oh, miss Williams, I saw your father on the way down here. Maybe we'd better ride to town in that direction. I'll explain to you what happened. [ Door closes ] You bungled. Two men I never saw in these parts before. They almost caught Sam and Higgins. Mert here tried to shoot them, but he needs the sights on his rifle fixed. Out with it. What happened? I tried to hit one of those hombres, but I-I shot Sam. What happened to Higgins? I don't know. [ Footsteps ] I'm Allen fain, the new Indian agent. I'd like to examine some of the markings on your furs. Go ahead. You'll find everything in order. Higgins is dead. In a shack on stony creek. I'm more interested in what happened to them strangers. I've got those two in jail. The one named Tex I can hold for the killing of Higgins, but I'm not so sure about the other. What do you know about that deaf old sheriff? He ain't the sheriff. Sheriff's been out of town for a week. That's old man Wilson. Sheriff left him here to look after things. Just to look after things, huh?

Give me that other gun back here! Why, of all the rapscallions I ever saw. [ Laughing ] Me big Indian chief. Make powwow. Oh, a thief, huh? No, no. Chief powwow. Oh, chief powwow. How. How. How come you got him in jail? No moratorium. That's Latin. Chief went to law school. It means "release the prisoner." That's me. How about me? You keep quiet. Hey, do you realize that he killed an Indian? A brother of yours? Don't got brother. Me chief. What'd you say?Him chief! Oh, yes, chief. Me say Indian... [ Incoherent ] You're right. I've got to release the prisoner. On what grounds? Yeah, yeah, on what grounds? Ugh. Umpum! Umpum! There you are. Couldn't ask for better grounds. Best argument I ever heard in favor of releasing a prisoner. The sheriff would want me to. Hey, chief, I got mixed up in this with your friend there. How about getting me out? If he's a friend of yours, we'd better help him. Me don't know him. I thought you was going to see the sheriff. I rode over to whitlock to see the circuit judge about my father's affairs. He gave me this paper and said it would get Mr. Wyatt out of jail. I sort of felt responsible for your being here. Well, I'm glad somebody's interested in getting me out of jail. It's in order, all right. You've got to stick around until the judge can hold a trial. I'll be very much around when the judge holds a trial! Say, Mr. Wyatt, I'd like to see you over at the hotel. Oh. I think maybe we'd better take these two along. All right. I can't understand why my father didn't leave some kind of message. He was always so careful about that sort of thing. From the looks of that cabin, I don't think he had time to do anything except to put up a battle. No, he wouldn't hide that cache of furs without leaving me some word where to find it. You see, my father had permission to trade on the reservation. He brought the Indians medicine, and they all liked him and saved him their best furs. He was always trying to do something to help people. I thought maybe if I could find that cache of furs that I could go on with the work he'd started. Well, we aren't leaving this territory until whoever killed your father is brought to justice. You can depend on that, miss Williams.You sure can. Oh, he isn't a real Indian. No, he's a pal of mine. Panhandle Perkins. We're rangers. Right now we're working with Tex, helping out with his trouble. Wait till I get this regalia off and you can see what I really look like and thank me in person. Wait a minute, panhandle. You've shown up on the settlement as chief tall wolf. You can't change now. The only chance you have of finding out any information is going around as an Indian. Well, miss Williams, we'll let you know the minute we get track of anything. Are you staying here at the hotel? Yes, for a while. Do you mind if I search that cabin? I'll bet I can find that message. I certainly appreciate your help and thank you a lot. Say, Tex, what was the idea of letting that Indian agent put you in jail? Because the man that calls himself fain isn't the Indian agent. What's that? I know Allen fain. This man is an imposter. And you think something happened to the real agent. I don't like to think so, but looks that way. We can't make a move to arrest the man who calls himself fain without proof. It looks mighty hopeless to me. Dead Indians that ain't Indians, an Indian agent that ain't an Indian agent, and somebody killing off people, and we haven't the smokiest idea who it is. At least we know why we were sent into the territory. Ordinarily it would be up to the Indian agent to do the investigating, but he's disappeared. I'll see if I can pick up his trail. Panhandle, that was a good idea of yours about searching the Williams cabin. Dave, you, uh, sort of hang around town. Miss Williams may need help. Oh, he always gets to be ladies' man. Ah, that is because I'm smart. Move, Indian, and pronto. Ugh. It's about time you two got here. Why? What are you all head up about? An Indian chief got Tex Haines out of jail, and then that Williams girl got a legal paper that took that other one out. Come here. Gar, take a look. That must be your Indian chief. I never saw him around here before. Sneed, go fix yourself up in one of those Indian getups. Trail him and see what you can learn. How. How. How, how. How, how. How! How, how, how, how! Ugh! Ugh! Wassum. Wassum why. Wassum there. Wassum...there. Ohh! Ah! Cham-cham. Aah! Aah! Aah! [ Whooping ] [ Whooping ] You smokum peace pipe? Yeah. You smokum? Good. Now. Ugh. Me smokum. Good. You started pipe. You smokum. Hai. [ Grunts ] Good. You smokum. [ Opens door ] [ Laughing ] [ Laughing ] [ Groaning ] What's the matter with you? Why didn't you use the back entrance? What's the matter with your idea? I trailed him to Williams' cabin. Well, what'd you find out? If that chief powwow is an Indian, I'm a mackerel. He's a white man?Trying to play our game. I think Tex Haines and Dave Wyatt are working with him. If they think they're going to get Williams first, they got another think coming. If we expect to get him, we got some thinking to do. Well, if we don't find him, there's plenty more in this territory. Come on, let's get in the back room. Wassum fur. We met before. That's right. The Williams ranch.Right again. What makes you so curious, stranger? I always get curious when somebody takes a shot at me. Why, I thought you was a fur thief. Well, that's a funny thing. I thought you were. I'm not, so what are you gonna do about it? At the moment, nothing. But don't shoot at me again. On your way to the Indian reservation, Mr. Fain? Yes. I was going out there to do a little checking out. I just come from there.And? Everything checks about the way I figure it. How would you figure it, Mr. Fain? Well, I don't know what you're talking about. You don't? I'm talking about this hat. I got it from the Indians. It has an "a.F." Marked in it. You wouldn't be knowing who it belongs to, would you? No. No, I wouldn't. Well, maybe I can refreshen your memory. This hat has a bullet hole in the back. The Indians found the owner in the bottom of a canyon and held a ceremony over him. You wouldn't like to see the place where he's buried, would you? This fur's also stamped with an "a.F." And the papers the man was carrying on him identified him as-- You didn't let me finish. As I was sayin', the papers in the man's pocket identified him as Allen fain. Now I'm going to let the sheriff figure out how Mr. Fain can be both dead and alive. Get moving. Hey, gar, come here. Take a look up the street. Wilson, I demand to be released. This man has no right to hold me. Every citizen has a right to make an arrest if he wants to. Oh, you're right. And I'm here to see that any man Tex arrests stays in jail. A ranger, huh? It ain't the first time, fain. All right, Wilson, lock him up. And we'll talk about the case Tex has against him. They must be lawmen. That was fain's hat Tex was carrying. Williams must have told his daughter where his fur cache is hidden. What good'll that do US? Might do US a lot of good. Panhandle, you say Williams kept talking about a wildcat? Yeah, but the mountains are full of 'em. Tex, is there any place around here called wildcat? Well, there's a lot of wildcat mines. [ Snaps fingers ] I saw a wildcat head out at the Williams cabin. That's the one panhandle was wearing. Where is it now?It's still on my head. No, it ain't, either. I wonder what happened to it. Ugh. Me come for girl. Chief many wampa's at cabin. Message from father. You mean there's an Indian chief at my cabin with a message from my father? Big chief no wait long. Horse. Now, wait a minute. I've gotta backtrack. I had that thing on out at the Williams cabin. Let me think now. I've got it! That Indian from the trading post, he had it on. Hey, that Indian, the one I met at the Williams cabin, he just rode out of town with miss Williams. Take the shortcut! Take the shortcut! Let's separate and see if we can pick up a trail. Put this wildcat in the back room. Let go of me! Shut up and get in there. I don't think that girl knows where the furs are. I'm not so sure about it. With a little stronger persuasion, she'll tell US where they are. Store's closed. Yeah, I know. I want to look at your guitars. I'd like to get one for a friend of mine. [ Plays out-of-tune strings ] [ Plays strings in tune ] This one seems to be pretty good. I'd like your advice. See how it sounds with my voice. [ Tunes guitar ] ♪ I'll wait for you, dear ♪ throughout the years ♪ I'll be your only ♪ I'll share your tears ♪ I'll be your sunshine ♪ when day is through ♪ just say you love me ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ I'll keep on waitin' ♪ though it's in vain ♪ I understand, dear ♪ you're not to blame ♪ whatever happens ♪ I know you're true ♪ throughout my life, dear ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ when day is ending ♪ the moon is high ♪ I watch true lovers ♪ go passin' by ♪ it all reminds me ♪ of days we knew ♪ if you'll come back, dear ♪ I'll wait for you that guitar fits your voice mighty fine.

[ Pounds on door ] Throw your guns behind the counter. You open the door and let that girl out of there. Hurry up! Hold it. Get up. Get that key out of his pocket, Dave. Ellen's in that room. All right, you two, you're on your way to jail. Out that door. Come to me, kitty. Come on, kitty. Sneed: Put that down! Put it down. Uh-huh. So, you want to be tough, huh? Wait a minute. You can't jump a king with a man. Why, you sidewinder, I'm jumping a king with a king. Sneed: You're jumping, but not with a king. Your horses are at the stable. I found something worth a fortune. Grab your guns. All right, get in there. Hey! You spoiled a good move! What is it, panhandle? What happened? The message, it was in there. Message? What message? I got hit on the head and I can't remember. Come on, think hard. What was it? Oh, it was a message from your father. Yes, panhandle. What did it say? I can't remember. Come on, panhandle, think. Wilson doesn't know anything. He's locked up. I guess we'll let him sit that way for a while. What's the matter with panhandle? He found out something about Ellen's father and he can't remember what it is. Come on, Ellen, you'd better wait in the hotel. Hotel. That's it--a hotel. Do you know anything about an old hotel at the humber gold camp? It's about the only building left in the old mining town. That's where your dad hid the furs. Do those men know about it?Yeah. I know where it is, Dave. You stay here with miss Ellen, panhandle. Mert, you and gar see what's upstairs. The back room is just loaded with furs. Well, get 'em out. Throw 'em down here. Get this. Must have taken Williams years to collect these furs. These are the best I've ever seen. There must be a fortune here. Shh. Sounds like somebody's outside. Awful quiet in there. You think they spotted US? I'm afraid so. [ Gunshot ] [ Gun clicks ] All right, come on out of there. One moment, my little Indian friend. You have reached the end of the trail. Get back in there. In you go, my Indian friend. In you go. Tex, what happened? It's all right, Ellen.
