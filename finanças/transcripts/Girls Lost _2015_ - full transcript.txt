Come back, Kim! Come back! If you're blind to what is different, this story is not for you. But if your eyes are open, you should listen carefully. Mama'. Mama'.! - Hey, Momo! - Shit, we're going to be late! Hurry up! Come on! Fucking lesbians! - Tony! - Damn... - No ugly cunts allowed. Cut it out! Let us by! Idiot! Kim! Kim! What did you say, you little whore? Why do they hate us so much? Because we're not like everyone else in that fucking school. I wish I was one of the boys. No one calls them ugly cunts. I do not want to be like them. - I didn't order this. - What is it? I don't know. Let's plant it and find out. Take it out, will you? - It looks really funny! - Check out the bottle! - Put it in there. - A hole would help. You have to be nice to the seeds or it won't work. Should we put some extra soil on top...? I wonder how long it will take for it to grow? There may be better soil over here. - Amazing. In one night. - Unbelievable! But how...? Maybe it's magic! - Look! It's moving! - Shit! Why are you cutting it'? Bella, stop! It's okay. See these buds? That's how you can tell it's a female flower. It smells sweet - like vanilla. It might be poisonous. Don't taste it. - What are you doing? - Making bracelets for us. You might be right. What if it is magic? You can have Iefiovers for lunch. Dad? If you're not going to work today either, can you at least do some yard work? Mom would really be pissed that you don't care for her garden anymore. - Can't we eat together? - I have to go to school. I'm already late. Can you get some food on your way home? - Bye. - Bye, sweetheart. - Come on! - What's the point? If you don't believe in it, it won't work. Come on. No one will yell at us or grab us. They'll leave us alone. Believe it. Go! Yes! One more time! Come on, Kim! - Missed again! - What a pussy! You can do it, Kim. Come on. You got it. The final... - She's using the boys' racket! - Stop! Try the girls' racket next time, Kim. - Switch ! - Okay, let's switch. - Good job! - That's sick. Extra lap! Extra lap! Extra lap! Kim! Kim! Throw the ball! Check out her tits! Faster, boobless! Boobless! Booblessl Boobless! Booblessl Boobless! We're done. Pick everything up. Kim? - Does team spirit mean anything to you? - Not really. - You have a bad attitude. - You have a bad attitude! Why don't you tell the boys to shut up? You're the teacher here! Kim, you've got to toughen up. If the boys are tough on you, be tough back. You're fourteen, right? If something makes you mad, you have to give as good as you get. Take responsibility for the situation. You're a part of it, too. Shape up! I don't want any more of that attitude! Are you okay? I want to kill them. Especially Jesper, that stupid jerk. I thought the bracelet would help, but no. Show us your tits! Stop! Fucking assholes! Pull off her shirt! - Pull! - Pull! Here's your shirt, you ugly cunt. Fucking cunt! - Bella! What happened? Are you okay? - My bracelet's gone. Cocksuckers. - If we look, we'll probably find it. - You can have my bracelet, Bella. Screw it. Never mind... It's probably not all that magical anyway. To hell with this. I'm not going to school anymore. Kim, can you pick up your towel? Is everything okay, otherwise? Kim! Everything's fine, Mom. I can't stop thinking about what happened to Bella. Me, neither. It really pisses me off. - You will never leave me, right? - What do you mean? I'm right here. If I tell you something... ...do you promise not to tell anyone? Not even Bella? Sometimes it feels like I have a zipper somewhere. If I'm brave enough to pull it, there's a different body underneath... ...that's the real me. I can't explain it. It just doesn't feel right. - Do you think I'm completely disgusting? - No. But I think you'll like what I made for you. I remember when we were small and you made costumes for us. That was a long time ago, when your mom was alive. She threw tea parties for us in the greenhouse. Look! It wants us to follow it. Come on! Kim! The butterflies must be hers! It really smells like vanilla, Bella. I want to feel how it tastes. - Don't do it, Kim. - Are you scared? No. Come on! I'm going to. - No, I don't want to. - Come on, Momo! Once? Fine. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Shit! - What was that'? What the hell? Shh! Do you hear that'? Let's go outside! Kim? My voice! Wow! Shit! What's happening? Look! There's a dimple in my chin! Look at my hair! Whoa! Totally insane... I have a dick! - Me, too! - It's like a baby bird. Really sofl. - Kim, wait! Where are you going? - School! Come on! Come on, Momo! Look! Now I'm faster than you! Don't look at them, Kim. Don't look. Are you new around here? We never seen you before. No. We're from out of town. - Oh. Well, I'm Tony. - Kim. This is...Momo and Mackan. Rm, Moms and Mackan? What weird names! Are you the three musketeers or what? Do you want to play? Yeah. Come on! Me and some buddies are having a party on Wednesday night. Down by the old forest. It'd be nice if the "three musketeers" brought the beer. Sure. Sure. - Cheers! - Cheers! Crazy! - Mackan? What's with the dorky name? - I panicked. No one recognized us as boys! If I'm going to be a guy, I want a cool name - like Tony. - He's a fucking dork. - He was okay. He invited us to a party. Ow! What the hell are you doing? Are you okay? What if this is just a dream? Look, real blood! - I'm bleeding. - Let me see. What if we never turn back into ourselves? I always want to be like this. Momo, Bella, wake up! - My breasts are back again! - I want to do it again - now! The guys left us alone. How did they not recognize us? - We still look like us... - No, we don't. Our hair and eyes are the same, but we're completely different as boys. If we do it again, we have to do it together, okay? Nobody does it alone. Do you swear? - Yes. - Me, too. Shit! School! Shit! School! -10 bucks says I win! Kim! Go, Kim! Keep going! Good! Jesper! Jesper! Jesper! - Damn! - Awesome Kim! Kim, you're the best! - Stop it! - Shut up, you cunt! - What did you call her? - Move it! - You're a fucking idiot! - Move it, you fucking whore! Call me a whore one more time. Please. You. Ugly. Fucking. Whore. Hit me! Go on, hit me! What the hell? Now you react?! Come here. Come on. That's right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - New boots? Nice. - They don't look too new, do they? - My mother doesn't know I got them. - They're cool. - That should be enough. - I'm not so sure we need this much. Okay. Don't forget the cigarettes. - Hello! - Hi, Bella. - How's your dad? - Fine. - And you? - Just fine. - The beer is for him, right? - Yep. He asked for three packs of smokes too. - Really? - Yep. We wouldn't have got them, if you hadn't flirt with him. And we got them. Hurry up! Here you go. - And for you. - Thanks. - It smells really sweet. - Go on, then. Let's do it. - Let's make a toast. - To the three musketeers! - All for one - And one for all. Mama';? Thanks. - Don't inhale. Just hold it in your mouth - I feel sick anyway! I really feel dizzy. I have to lie down. Here we go... Do you feel it? What's that smell? Almost done, Hawk? You're really slow. Done. - Here. - It's okay. What the hell? Inhale the smoke. - Leave him alone. - Can'! you see he's sick? Say something, Kim! Kim?! Screw this, let's go. Are you coming? I think I'll stay a while. Just an hour or 50. Okay? Are you sure? Come on. Kim, come with us! - How was the joint'? - It's really good. Listen. You're going to help me with something. I think you'll like it. Okay? Can I have some? If the alarm goes off, run like hell! There. There. Take everything you find. Hurry up, Kim! Hurry! Kim! Go! Damn! - What are you going to do with all that'? - Sell it. Mom's old man will do it for me. What's that'? A Zippo lighter. - Nice. - It's probably from the Vietnam War. Look. - Is it broken? - No. You have to till it with gas. Nice. You can have it. Seriously? - For helping me. - Thanks. Don't tell anyone, okay? It's between you and me. Wow! Do you sleep here? Sometimes. - Take two. - What is it? Who knows? My mom takes them to relax. What are you doing? You'll kill it! It'll be fine. I can't keep it downstairs. It screams like hell in the morning. Come on. It's so fucking high! It's so fucking high! Ton)'- - Who's that? - A friend. He helped me last night. - You're doing a good job. - Thanks. -5,000? - No! I want 7,000 for everything. I'll give you six. Fine. Thank... - Were you in a fight? - Nope. If you tell anyone... ...I'll kill you. - You can trust me. - Can I? Good. I've got to take off. - See you. - Yeah. - I'm really disappointed in you, Kim. - I know. I'm sorry. Listen... I don't know why you say you're sorry when you don't mean it. Hit it with the girls' racket, and I'll give you 10 bucks. - What about this one? And an extra lap? -120. Make it 200, and you stop calling us "cunt" and "whore" every day. Strike. Two hits left. I told you that you couldn't do it! Fuck! - Jesper. - What the hell do you want? - I want my money. - What money? - You're not giving it to me? - I don't have it all. You're lying. I've been scared of you since firstgrade. What a fucking waste of time. You're going to leave me, Bella and Momo alone. Got it'? The flower is dying, Momo. Kim! - I need some more. - What's so great about Tony? That is why you want to be a boy again. I want to understand! When I'm with him, it's like I'm drunk or something. I never want it to end. I need more - now! Move! - You're crazy! - What if this is who I am? You drive. That's it. Faster. Faster. Faster! - I can't drive any faster. - Yes, you can! What the hell...? Kim! Slow down. Kim! Slow down! Kim, slow down! Nice, isn't it'? - Feel it. - I don't want to. Feel it. It's cold. Heavy. If you want to kill yourself, you don't shoot yourself in the temple. It's better to shoot yourself in the mouth. Press it against the roof of your mouth. Did you think it was loaded? - Do you think I'm an idiot? - No. No? She's pretty, huh? She and Tony are fucking. She likes to take the sperm in her face. You only talk about her like that because she's a girl. - What's that mean? - You fucking disgust me. Tony doesn't give a shit about you. Don't you get it'? Are you his best friend now? Where are you going? Hey! What are you doing? - Aren't you coming? - No, I've...got to get home. Where have you been? With Tony. Are you in love with him? Or do you just want to be like him? I don't know. I think I like him so much because... ...he doesn't know who he is, either. - What do you mean? - He's trying to be someone he's not. I didn't realize it at first... ...but now I do. Do you understand? Shit, I have fallen in love with you. I want you here with me, not with Tony. I don't understand. Do you want to be a boy who loves girls or boys? Or both? Remember when I told you it felt like... ...there was someone else in my body? That you had a zipper you weren't brave enough to pull? It doesn't feel like that now. Now it just feels...right. Like me. Is that more important than Bella and me? Did you hear what I said? Yes. But you don't want me as a girl, do you? Tomorrow, you, me and Bella are hanging out. Like we did before that goddamn flower. You owe us that, Kim. You owe me that. Olga? Olga? Olga? No! - She looks like she has cancer. - Yeah. With cancer you get medicine, but I don't know what to give her. - Give her some nourishment. - It might help. What do I know? Get over it, you two! You're acting childish, both of you! If we forget the flower, things will be like they were before. Won't they, Kim? Do you promise not to touch her? I promise to leave her alone. Come on, Bella. We have to try! - What should we do? - Suggestions? Can you quit doing that? - Damn it, Kim, stop it! - This was your idea. Should we dress up and have a tea party? It stinks in here. I'm going out. Kim! I don't trust her, Momo. If she takes any more of the flower, it'll die. Listen, Bella. What if Kim really is a boy? - What are you talking about? - On the inside. If the flower made her realize it, isn't that a good thing? I don't know if I like Kim as a guy. She's so different. So egotistical. Don't you think so? - Are you coming? - Yes. - What's with you? - My stomach really hurts. Are you getting your period? I'm going to go buy beer. Want to come? - No, I'll stay here. - Come on. I want to talk to you. Heads up! Kim, let's go. What the hell? Kim, come back! What are you doing? - Do you have a light? - No. Can't you see it's me? Kim! Stop! Please! I don't want to have it... Wait up! Next time, I'll let the police catch you. You got that'? Fucking faggot! What the hell do you want'? - Calm down. - Quit following me. - I have something important to tell you! - I don't care! Beat it! - You're fucking disgusting! - Tony, please... - Give me back my lighter. - Why? - Because I say so. - I'm not going... Give it to me! Did you hear what I said? Stop! - No! Tony, Stop! - Fucking disgusting! - Do you want to burn? - No! Then get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out! Bella! Kim! I've been looking for you... ...everywhere! Why? You and Bella hate me. I can understand why. When we turn into boys, it's not the same for us as it is for you. Maybe something went wrong when you were born. But it seems like you are a boy. For real. Even though you look like a girl. But I see her in you now as well. You do? We been so mean to you and Bella. And for what? There are lots of good things about being a guy. But for me, there are even better things about being a girl. I want to be a girl. But you don't want to. Or you can't? Am I right? Remember when I wanted you to explain it to me? I think I finally understand, Kim. - No, Momo. - Isn't this how you want me? I can never be like him. - This is the best I can do. - Momo, please. No. If you only want me like this, as a boy, I can be that for you. No... Then what'? What will it take for you to want me? What'?! - Take it easy. - Shut up. - I don't want... Tony, stop. Stop! - Quiet! Tony, stop. Tony, stop! - No! Stop it! I don't want to. - Shut up! - Stop in - Shut up! Stop it! Can't you see she doesn't want to? - Stop it! - Beat it! 'Go! 'TOW. stop: Stop it, Kim! - Stop it! - Stop it! Let go of me! What are you doing? What's happening to you? - He was raping her. - And you were almost killing him! You're as bad as he is! Don't you get that you need to stop? Come back, Kim! Come back! No! No! No! No! - Let go of me! - I can't do that. Kim, do you know who set the greenhouse on fire? You know this is serious, Kim. I'll leave the door cracked. Just call if you need me. Don't look for me. I'll miss you, Mom. I LOVE YOU, MOMO. We finally killed her. What are you going to do now, Kim? Run away? I have to, Bella. I don't know who I am. Don't you understand? I've ruined...us. I found it in the school yard. Here. You may not believe me, but I'll never take mine off. "All for one." So incredibly childish. Take care at Mama. Here. Take the roots. Forgive me. I know it's all my fault. Kim? Don't go and do anything stupid now, will you?
