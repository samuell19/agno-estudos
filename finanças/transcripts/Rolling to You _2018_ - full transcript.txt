It's absurd, huh, but ... I'm embarrassed, sorry. It's ridiculous, this story. Do not take it bad, huh? In fact... - You are ashamed. You are uncomfortable in front of your customers? It's the small glimmer of compassion who's bothering you? Or the honeyed side which gives them the impression to take your disability? It makes you feel guilty, compassion. Or those who want show us that we are like them. We are no longer like them. Must accept it. It's like that. No need to hide your chair, no one is going to steal it. - This is my assistant. She...

Finally, Jean-Luc, our ping-pong champion. - Yes. - Come on, we have a drink. - To our champion! - To our champion! - How is it managed? your disability sports federation, who is playing against whom? I mean, there are categories, hierarchies according to what you remain ... Finally, according to your handicap? It's the steps of legs against footsteps? For example, Jean-Luc, I imagine you're playing with your mouth. You would have the right to play against a guy who would have only one arm? Or do you have to play against no arms at all? There is not much adversaries, I imagine. Must admit. Who decides this? Who decides that you, Simon, with your iron slats, you run faster only with a wooden leg. Whoever has little arms, does he have to swim only against small arms or can he swim, eventually, against small legs? - We understood, Jocelyn. - Who is it? - And you, you do not play sports? - Uh no. - You are wrong. - Your body must feel that you love him. - Who is it? - Do not put it aside. - Who is it? - Assume. - Who is it? - Forget the eyes of others. - Who is it? - I am deaf ! - Classical violin music ... * J.-S.

No it's me. It's personal. I find you very beautiful. But I think he too. He likes pretty women. - You must please him. You are pretty, too. - Oh... - Are you in love with him? Embarrassed laughter - Jocelyn? To do what ? - Well, I do not know. He is a handsome man, he has a beautiful situation ... It's because of his disability? - No... No no no no. No no no no. No no no no. You're in luck. - Oh? Why ? - Because you have suffered. And I think that people who have suffered are more optimistic. They appreciate life more. I read that in Biba, I think. It said, "Life is a long journey in the middle of the night." You, it's as if you had a flashlight. - Mmh ... It's a very beautiful sentence. - Yeah. - For a woman like you, in love, optimism is that it lasts. - Yes. - For me, it's happening. Someone's knocking at the door.

They are OK. - And why would I go see a classical concert in Prague? - And why are you going to see a handisport match? Huh? And then, it's Italy, right? - It's my mother who is Italian. - Exactly. Go in yourself, standing, walking. The classic, it gives wings. It feels good to tell the truth and to apologize. She is not fooled. We do not stink feet when not in use. Ah.

You said you were not a soloist, but you were singing alone. - I do not sing, I play. - Yeah ... "Play" alone is the same. - It's not a lie. The soloist was sick, I replaced her.

Are you supposed to bend? - You can bend, yes. It's a reflex. - Boudin, puree. - Nice to meet you. Max. No it's for me. Thank you. - Spinach in cream without cream. Good tasting. - You can even have children. All is operational, but without pleasure. The bottom is dissociated from the top. The bottom makes love, the top is a spectator, if the paralysis is complete. Otherwise, you can still feel yourself pissing. I make it short. Ejaculation too is possible, thanks to medicines and a reeducation to regain orgasm. Not to mention para-orgasm Intensity almost equivalent to pleasure caused by orgasm. - It is complicated. - It's not meant to be simple. - How do you know all this? - I knew that you were going to ask me, so I revised. Do you want another advice? Leave it alone. - You're right. I'll tell him everything. - Wow. * Billy Paul: "Me and Mrs Jones" a. - Good evening. - Good evening. A. Wow! - Here. It's at my house. A champagne bucket. Go! Embarrassed laughter - That's Fort Boyard, at you. - I usually go on the other side. Hop! Opening cupboard doors Not here ... In the kitchen. Stress moans a. Over there. A. Here. Crockery I found! - Are you playing the piano? - Uh no. Why ? - Well, because you have a piano. - Ben ... It's not because we have a piano that we play the piano. Have carpets, and I do not do judo. I did not even know he was playing. - Finally, he does not play alone. I help him a little. Florence plays "Me and Mrs Jones" a. She closes the piano. I'm thirsty! - Me too. Mmm ... - We are talking about it ? - Of? - Of that. What happened to you - Ah ... Good. Jocelyn sighs. I had a horse accident. I fell off the horse, actually. Like Christopher Reeve. The one who makes Superman. - But he is the total. - But me, it was a little horse, a Poney. I fell from below. - This is the first time you joke on that, it feels good. And me, you do not ask me? - No. I do not want to bother you ... - You do not bother me. If you tell, I tell. I burned a priority. I made 4 tons. The person in front broke his collarbone, and I lost my legs. Fortunately, my violin did not have anything. Nature is well made. - Good ... Uh ... Florence... Are you sitting? I want to say... you're ready to hear Something easy to say? - Jocelyn ... you do not give me the shot the declaration? Not the 2nd night. The last time I gave in, it did not bring me luck. I was betrayed. - Ah ... - A firefighter. An officer. It's reassuring, though, a firefighter. The night of his birthday, I said to myself : "Here, I'll surprise him." He was on duty. I went to the barracks with a teddy disguised as a fireman. Good. Not very original, but ... A bottle of champagne, a little box of caviar. And then, I waited for him, I waited for him, I waited for him ... 笙ｪ would have done better to wait at the switchboard of 18. A big redhead with huge breasts. So, I left him. He tried to come back, huh. He wrote me beautiful letters, he sent me beautiful flowers ... It did not work. - Why ? - He betrayed me. - You could have forgiven. - He lied to me, he lied to me. - Fault discovered half forgiven. - No. - No ? - No. - Good. - It was what, this thing not easy to say? - Do you know how to swim ? - Yes. - Here. - Did you see Titanic? - Yes. BEEP Adam Naas: "Please, Come Back to Me" a. - And ... It was good ? I want to say, did you feel something? - Yes. The. And you ? - Um yes. The same. The. You're right, Max. I'm lost. I'm not going splurge... - A cripple. - I did not go around. I'm 50 years old, cash, my hair ... I'm fine, I'm not at the end. She's in a chair, shit. Where am I going? - Good. Come on, you can pack up. You know, Jocelyn, I can do an endoscopy, I can even go until the digital rectal examination, but I'm not your shrink. - No, but you're my friend. You have to tell me why I'm doing this. - Did not you think you were in love? I know, it's stupid, but it happens. I do not like that, I do not like 93 --- But not at all. - Neither do I. It's not good. - She wants to know my friends. Who do I present to him? You are the only ones aware. - That does not mean that we endorse. - I will tell him. I have to give myself time. It takes the right moment to say him. Here. - If you do not do it, I do it. It's not a restaurant, it's a bowling alley. He speaks Chinese. - Arigato. - Good evening. - Good evening. - So here is Florence. Mary, whom you know. Max. My... my friends. - Good evening. African accent - I'll take some more rice alcohol. Marie laughs. I make the African accent. I do not know how to make the Chinese accent. Ah, here. A roll. If I may an indiscreet question. To do your job, traveling, etc. To be in an armchair, it must be disabling. Finally, way of talking. Have an uncle who is in a chair. - The world is small. - Eh yes. He has no more legs. A malformation at birth. It happens once on millions. - No chance. - Delicious, these spring rolls. - Yes. - Yes. - And then, especially, he was badly treated after the accident. - It was not born? - The legs, but not the arm. He jumped on a mine, in South Africa. - No chance. - Without his arm, he can no longer use his chair. Yes. He turns on himself. - They are falling, these spring rolls. - In any case, beautiful story. It's nonsense, "one lost, ten found". His arm, he never found it. Fortunately, you will tell me. Because 10 arms ... Marie laughs. A. Can you imagine the octopus? - They are falling, these spring rolls. - Jacques! - Oh... Florence. What a surprise ! Right here. - Jacques, a colleague of the orchestra. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening. - It's weird of ... Sylvaine, an artist friend. Man's voice - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. - BONSOIR. - I said to myself : "Hey, what if we made a Chinese?" - Oh yes. Ben, good appetite. Man's voice - Thank you and good evening. - Good evening. Good. Uh ... Florence, I have to tell you something. - Oh fuck ! I have soy sauce on the fut. - Put salt. - Here. - Thank you. Max. "What? - Are you taking me to the bathroom? - But of course. You're a coward. You're really a coward. - If we tell him now, she will not accept it. - Anyway, she will not accept it. - Great minds think alike. - My chair is outside ... - I'll get it for you. - Yes. - Do not move. - Well no. - Sylvaine is a friend, huh. - Yes. It's not a problem. 'Pee ? If you need help, do not hesitate. My father is sick. I sometimes give him a helping hand for his personal hygiene. - It's okay. I... I have what I need. - He's pooping. bell - I'm a little early. - Good evening. - Hello. - Yes, I hit a disabled person. I like that. It relaxes me. - Its good. I do not hurt. It's okay. - Listen to me carefully, the shoe salesman. You will tell the truth to my sister. Tell him you're walking, that you did not care about us, that you regret and you're a shit. And above all, you tell him all that without hurting him. If it's possible. Otherwise, I'm putting on my heels 10 cm in the ass. And you will understand what is an oil drilling. You have 48 hours. - Julie! Julie! Julie! That's not what you believe. And then, 48 hours ... Tell him yourself. You will find the words. You look sensitive. I CAN P35- - You know what ? You are the most handicapped of the two. \ It's not up to me to to do, it would be worse. You wanted to play con? Assumes. Thank your brother. He told me that. He told me that it was for your good. Soft music a. - Queer. A. - Ah ... a. Oh... You need money, you. - I'm paying here, Dad. - Here, it pays? - A little. - Ah g And... The burial of your mother went fine ? - What is a funeral? is going wrong? Had to come. - Too late. Jocelyn sighs. - I'm in shit. - It's pity. Without his chair, you would not have looked at it like that. Whistle - No. I have no pity. She is stronger than us. She breathes harder, she lives harder ... I am a coward. That's all. - Tell him the truth. - If I tell him the truth, I lose it. - And the sister? The auxiliary of life. With big tits. She's not looking for work? - We say more "big tits", dad. He's laughing. - Maybe, but there are still some. And bigger and bigger. A. And more and more expensive. - What are you doing ? - Pee. Do not worry. I am equipped. You can come and sit down. Ben, go to Lourdes. - What, Lourdes? - You go to Lourdes with her, and you make a wish. And then, you get up from your chair, you are frolicking and healed. - Whatever. - Do you have a better solution? 48 hours. So... -1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and slip. She counts the steps. - And you'll get up like this? - Not at once. I'm going to crawl a little, I will put steps. A miracle is progressive. - And she'll believe it? Max! We focus! A. - Leave him. I feel that you are leaving in "not good". I was wrong. You do not need him. - I need nobody, Julie. Phone ring a. Well, well. It's him. Hello? No. You do not bother me Yes. Yes. Okay. See you tomorrow. Miss. - Yes. - He wants to go to Lourdes. - In Lourdes? - You would not have a red a little less "catch me tonight". - I'll see what I have. - But what will he look for? - A miracle. "-A miracle." - Finally, Julie. You did not understand ? Jocelyn, he walks. Like you. Like the lady. He has never been disabled. You know it, you have sparkling eyes. When your eyes sparkle, you have new shoes either you feel guilty. - How do you know ? - Because I am disabled. Quiet. The naive little girl ... "Little girl", I'm having fun. She decided to say nothing, to offer a parenthesis of happiness against a lie. It feels good to feel loved. It feels good to believe it. Good times, you have to know how to catch them. - Do we grab the bra? - No, but it's silly. - It was you who brought it to me. A gift, it does not refuse. - But ... you know for a long time? - Almost enough to be used. - Why did not you tell me? - Not that you stop me. So I know, it's silly. I wanted to know how far it would go. The hardest, finally, it's when it stops, right? When we can more pretend to believe it. - What are you going to do when will he get up? - Nothing. Say goodbye. Melancholic music - It's not absurd. People with psoriasis came back with healthy skin. After a trip. - Yes Yes. That is true. A man who lost his foot in a ham slicer, two days after Lourdes, one finger toe started to grow back. - AH YES, YES, YES. YES YES YES YES. - Yes Yes Yes. - Yes. That is true. - Oh yes, yes. - Your uncle should have come with us, Mary. For his arms and legs. - Oh yes, it's a shame. - YES YES YES. - Ask for my beautiful crucifixes! - She is beautiful, my Blessed Virgin! - Two holy virgins bought, a little Jesus won! bells - Hello sir. - Hello. - For miracles, how does it happen ? - Miracles? Wow... - Ah yes. - Excuse me, gentlemen. bells Can I talk to you? Rhythmic music a. You. Follow me. No. The nurse stays outside. - I'm not a nurse. - Watch out for the fake dish. Put the brakes. If you get up, you lie twice. You are not paralyzed. From Lourdes, we come back with photos, a dedication of Saint Bernadette, a bottle filled with holy water ... We rarely come back with his legs. In any case, not since I'm here. Maybe I bring bad luck, but what is important for people, here, it's coming with faith. When they leave, they have only a hurry: come back to believe it again. Do not mess this little flame. Keep for yourself what motivates you and think about not disappointing them. It's your conscience and you. Do you say that if you get up, we will be forced to make a small picture. It's not common, miracles. - But ... How do you know that I am not paralyzed? - Your shoes. They are worn. Melancholic music a. - What do we do, now, Max? - Euh_. I'm going to get the Pom'Potes. A. Hello. - Hello. - Do you have a cigarette? You're from the corner? - Not really, no. Truck horn a. Squealing tires - Oh shit ! - Need a statement? - A miracle... You walk. You're walking, Jocelyn. - You walk, Jocelyn. He ... He walks. It worked. - Yes it's... - A miracle. - A miracle, yes. It is... It worked. - Show me. Go ahead, show us. Charles Aznavour: "You've Got To Learn" a. - Are you a migrant? A. - Sorry. Sorry. Mary, you can come, please ? Get settled, Marie. Marie sobs. A. Something is wrong ? - No nothing. Finally ... Yes, everything. I wanted to tell you... I know that I am a secretary. Discreet. It's been 12 years that I am discreet. 12 years that I try to change your outfit every day to let me know But I do not have 70 sweaters. I multiply the combinations. 笙ｪ accommodates the ups and downs. Yellow skirt and blue sweater, blue skirt and yellow sweater, all in yellow. Finally, yellow sweater and yellow skirt. I'm a little Mrs. Patate. But, by the way ... Today is my birthday. Eh yes. Marie too, she is getting older. It's once a year. Except that I have not assistant to remind you. I am just an assistant. A. You never told me: "I like your scarf." "You changed the cut, "Married." Your way of saying my name lacks poetry. What do I have ? I'm bland? That's it ? I am too transparent? To deserve your lies? what do I have less than another? What do I have too much? Legs ? Sorry. I did not mean that. Excuse me ... I'm sad. I say anything. Excuse me, I ... You wanted to talk to me? - Happy birthday, Marie. - Oh g Oh thank you. I'm touched. I did not have that color. - I know. - He is handsome. Can I keep the box? Blow of a cannon Acclamations * Announcement in English a. A. Intense music // Jocelyn moans with pain. A. Acclamations // Jocelyn halﾃｨte. A. - So ? We give up before arrival? - What are you doing here ? - I was passing by, I typed "marathon", and I thought it was stupid not to enjoy it. Soft music a. Go! One A. - Course, course! A. - Yes! 'Yes!
