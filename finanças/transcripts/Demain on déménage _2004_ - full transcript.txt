Tomorrow We Move. More to the left... To the left... To the left... Charlotte, come and see! It made it! It got through! Careful, it's from Bohemia! Pure crystal. Pure? Careful! I'm allergic... To the smell... Of leather! My father made gloves here. My father's pride and joy. It was from my grandfather in Kaziemiez. - Kaziemiez? - In Poland, on the Vistule. Lucky he's not here to see that. - Luckily, not. - Luckily, so. Seems suddenly cluttered. Don't want the armchairs? - Too old... - Put them outside! You can't, Mom. This neighborhood's a junk yard! Shame about those armchairs. Want them back up? Where to put them? I dunno, those armchairs... At the end of the corridor was an armchair... An old armchair... On the armchair... Claudia and Pierre... Their naked bodies intertwined... They... What? They intertwine. No, said that already. Move the trunk to the left! They caress wildly... In a fervent frenzy... Your chicken's good, Charlotte. A bit greasy. A matter of skin. Yes, always a matter of skin. True, hence, "He's got her under his skin". Claudia's glistening skin mirrored his blazing body in the armchair... Yes, there are women who... And men who... He had the skin of a baby. What's the matter, Mom? It's the chicken. It was so young. It's not good? Yes, it is good. These chickens die so young. It'll be even better tomorrow. Your father loved his chicken. Lemon chicken, Basquaise chicken, mustard chicken, tarragon chicken... And when he was ill, a light chicken broth... Lucky he wasn't into legs, as I'm not into breast. Now good chicken's so hard to find. I'm going to bed. And you? Gotta finish my chapter. See you in the morning then? Not the morning! It's when I'm most concentrated. One word and I've to go back to bed! Not in the morning then! Their two bodies ablaze... in the armchair... It's so bad. So bad! I'm going nowhere! Those curtains are so dirty. It's a bit cold. Turn up the heater. I can't seem to manage. There, see? Set it to your liking. I always sleep window open. Okay, I'll open it. I miss him. I know, Mom. Me too. Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight, Charlotte. What now? I forgot the suitcase. Gently! It never did you any harm. - Gonna sleep with it? - Yes. An old suitcase? Yes, as old as you. Mom, tell me what's in the case. Better you didn't know. Mom! Be warned. You're a suitcase fetishist? It brings him closer. Who? Dad! I try not to forget his face. Mom, stop, it'll upset me! Okay, I'll stop. What are you writing? A commission. Has to be erotic. I'm stuck... Write dirty words. Such as? Prick. And? Cunt. Dick. And? - That's it. - That won't go far. Of course it will! Want I help you? Mom! Look around you, everything's erotic. Not to me. Draw on your life, your own experience. Nothing better. On Sundays, your father and I... While I was with your sister... Your dad and I would... Mom... Okay, I'll stop. Don't watch that filth, go to cafés, ride the metro. Listen, watch people... Their hands, their feet, their whole bodies... Their hands, their feet, their whole bodies... Your father's feet were such a... turn on. One clay, in this half-lit restaurant, we... Mom, please! I want to see. - What? - What's in the case. A hat. A shirt. A scarf. A tie. A pair of gloves. An underpants. A Mennen aftershave. An electric razor. A trousers. What's the matter? The piano is out of tune. The presence of this beloved obsessed her. His absence, so present, weighed on her. Prick! Dick! Ass! A few days later. When he enters the apartment, he catches her smell, enters the bedroom, and there she is, totally naked, eyes closed... He approaches and sees her matted sex... He begins to breathe, harder, and harder... I can't find the hoover. He begins to breathe harder. He begins to breathe harder, and harder, and harder... He leans over the young woman... No, he leans over the sex of the young woman, who is limply hoovering... The hoover stops dead. She screams. The fuses have blown. What calm! The piano, sixth ﬂoor! The sex of the young woman, limply hoovering... It stops dead. She screams. The fuses have blown. Fuses? What fuses? Too slow! Faster! Faster! Right! Wonderful! Let it sing! Take it away! C sharp! Dumping like that is illegal! - I know, but... - Then don't do it. I won't. Take that back upstairs. And that. No. Yes. Not mine. My mother's. In that case... C sharp! He told me to undress. I didn't want to. But you didn't, you didn't undress? Undress! I wanted to. I'd no choice. I did it. So what'd he do then? Well, first he set up a lamp. Then, he moved slowly around me... put a film in the camera... I was dead nervous, so I jumped up... Trembling from head to foot! His feet stank. A coffee. It was so hot in Africa, I could've died... Died? Could've died! Very attractive, very charming, special indeed... A rendezvous? Of course, Madam, total privacy. Rendezvous, charming, attractive... Not big, but very well proportioned. And the price is very reasonable. I've already shown several people, a real snip! Not big, well proportioned, a real snip. For a single woman... It's ideal! With view over the trees, and all electric. 500 Euros... No, that's including charges. That's exactly right. You're looking too, it seems. Everyone is, it's the season. The season? Yes, for real estate. My mom's just moved. See! - And you? - Me, no. I've a two-roomed apartment. Very charming, very calm. Very calm... Charming, well-proportioned, ready to go. All electric... That's right. It's local? Just next door! Number 87. Would it make an office? And how! I gotta think. Yes, I understand. So do I. About what? Everything and nothing. It depends. My name is Samuel Popernick. Charlotte Wienstein. I used to know a Wienstein. Probably my father. He's dead. I've thought. Then follow me! Luckily there's a lift, it's on six. Yes, luckily. Small, but better than nothing. Indeed, even small. The apartment has all mod cons, and few drawbacks, after all... Yes, after all... Like the all electric. Indeed, a good example. Yummy. They fumigated. Yes, I can smell it. Me too. Has a distinctive smell. Yes, very distinctive. It lingers... There's no getting rid of it. Don't worry, it'll go. Only, it stays in memory. But I'm glad they came. Who? Pest control. Those bugs are everywhere! Pest control, so that's the smell. It's not exactly new. It's empty- But you can fill it. Here's the bathroom, with toilet separate... Rare in France. Yummy. And a big bath. How much does the hot tank hold? A least 50 liters. Think I'll find inspiration? I can't say... Start with a little aspiration, that might help. You're so pensive. That smell, it's that smell. Just like in Poland. You know Poland? I've heard about it. Big, beautiful... Scorching summers, freezing winters. I know. You're a child of the third generation. How do you know? One can tell. I lost my whole family in Poland. I thought so. But it's always best to know. It's that smell... It all came rushing back. Fortunately, I never had children. Why, fortunately? Seems their parent's fate there pains them deeply. Even the third generation. I've no pains. Only glasses. It's a drag. Mr Popernick, nothing personal, but I'm not sure I'll take it. Because of the smell. Yes. It depresses me. Sure it's not me who depresses you? In“: Bad news, Mr Popernick, I'm not taking it. But the advantage is, it's right next door. Perhaps it is an advantage. What exactly bothers you? A feeling of sadness. You think I'm sad, don't you? You're right. - No, no... - Well what then? That you're kind, thoughtful. I'm the sad one, the depressive. Don't say it's not true. People like me have that effect on sensitive souls. Don't say it's not true. Won't you see it again, with a friend, a mother? I'll wear my beige suit. I've noticed, with my beige check suit things go much better... And with a mother, your mother, it'll feel better. - Due to experience? - Yes... Mothers are always more experienced. Especially mine. So, tomorrow morning, at 11? I've got insomnia. That's the third time this week, Mom. I can't sleep without TV. I'll get used to it. I've gotta sleep. I've gotta sleep. You smoked. The curtains are dirty. What? The curtains are dirty. Think so? I've always felt that poverty was dirty curtains. Try to sleep. W. H “M Again! It's too small here, impossible to keep any way tidy. So what'll we do? Try to sell this place. Again! With all this furniture... We'll never sell. It's us! Come in. Have a seat, while I get dressed. Lovely suit. You like it? I'm so happy. Mom, wake up. Pierre's here. Do your scales, she'll be right down. Her dressing gown was half open... And he looked, he looked... And his hand... Play with both hands, Pierre. True pianist's hands! My goodness, you're so hot. Yes, it's the emotion. When I'm moved, I'm cold. What a sound! Think so? You're a sensitive man. I'd love to see it, if you wouldn't mind. It's a Pleyel, or a Steinway, no? Beautiful. Don't look at me, I go blank. You should've been a pianist. Yes, but I'd have blanked before the audience. Mom, shall we go? Do your scales. Be right back. That smell! It'd remind you of Poland. As my mother would say. She couldn't stand it. The smell gets to you too. No, I couldn't see you here. So sorry to have bothered you. No bother, I'm driving. I feel so bad... And you wore your nice suit. Yes, such a nice serge. You really should take it, it just needs fixing up. But how? To your taste. I have no taste. Yes, taste is tricky... Yummy. It's dull today, but it has potential. But that smell! Yes, I know... I smell nothing today. - Nothing? - Not a thing. Out of friendship, I urge you to take it. I know, Mr Popernick, you're so friendly. But no, tomorrow I'm seeing a 70s studio with balcony and bay window. The 70s was so badly soundproofed. And even worse is that double curtain business! Really? If we sell the duplex you won't need a studio. We gotta sell. Yes, now's the time. Yes, Mr Delacre. About half past two. Yes, fine. The metro is Ménilmontant. See you later. Well? Not sure it'll be a quick sale. You just have to set it off nicely. But how? With flowers, lots of flowers, and plants. Nature-like, nothing more beautiful than nature. Jungle-like! I didn't say jungle, I said nature. Of course it'll be erotic, I'm on a roll. And water, lots of water. Not poetic, real coarse, with words like cunt and prick... C sharp! And dick and stuff. About the apartment? At one o'clock? Mr and Mrs Dietrich. Fine. Two forty-five. Not even armor plated! No, I couldn't bear it. Calm down, Olivier. Let's see the bathroom instead. - About the apartment? - That's us. - The Delacres? - That's us! That's the bathroom. See that? The pipes. - What? - They're lead. - You think? - Yes, I do. And what's that? I look awful! It's boiling! Be careful! The joints are all limed up. You're handy, you can change them. Come and see the bedroom. Y" w' No, it's lime. Makes you want to lie down. The sheets just need changing. The mattress isn't bad. And there's a cupboard. Lots of space. - Let me help. - So kind. Where's my wife? - Tidying. - As usual. Sitting room, kitchen, and the same downstairs. The piano's my Mom, she teaches. "I am a woman .." Very nice. Is there always such a racket? Is it noisy? Judge for yourselves. What's wrong? - We're disconcerted. - Why? You're supposed to say "No". - Why? - That's how it is. Sorry about the dirty curtains. - Doesn't matter. - It does... Charming, well-proportioned, a real snip! All electric, no load-bearing walls! Mn' The drawbacks? Yes, we have to know. Maybe there aren't any. - Then why sell? - To go elsewhere. I thought so. How big are the windows? We need to know for the double curtains. - Singles by night are not very... - Intimate! 1m 40! Intimacy is very important! 2m 12! Never thought of that. 104! - It's a question of eroticism? - Of course! 103. No, 105! How many liters in the hot tank? 100! On each ﬂoor! How many baths? It's incredible! What? 9! The number of baths! The pipes needs changing, they're not legal. We'd like to see below. Fully-fitted kitchen. Cooker with 4 halogen burners. Oven with micro-wave, oven without. Toaster, juicer, and check out the fridge. Love to. It's empty- Can be filled. Like a coffee? - If it's no bother. - Not at all. Have a seat. No need to stand like skittles! - See? No noise! - Never? Judge for yourselves. What calm! Found it! - What? - The coffee. It's always the same. When ready to quit, you must stand firm. I agree. - Charlotte Wienstein. - Mrs Charpentier. I'll show you the bathroom, it's vacant. Look yourselves, it's more intimate. But be warned, the piping doesn't meet the legal norms. A little music? Not Beethoven, he does my head in. I love him. I listen to him alone. One of the greats. Too humanist. I prefer music which sows doubt. - I have enough doubts. - Stop. - What? - Stop. It's indecent. Water pressure's too low. We're not buying. My wife and I only take showers. Never baths. It softens. It's indecent. Never baths. It's indecent. It softens. A pleasure to meet you. And you. Love the flowers. They're from Olympe? No, flowers like that have to be Falson. What people do to sell. Flowers from Falson. At least 430 Euros' worth! Did I already show you the toilets? I'm not sure. But, no hurry, drink your coffee. Hope it's not too strong. I'm always unsure. If it's too strong, we can add water. Take sugar? Yes. The sugar and a spoon. - Not having any. - I don't know yet. But why not! No, I'm unsure. So, where was I? Yes, no load-bearing walls so to change the layout, everything's possible. With a little imagination... Got any imagination? Oh, I forgot the music. Nothing like Gypsy music to raise the spirits! That's debatable. I'm sure it'll win you over. I adore it. Me too. And you, Frédéric? I feel you don't. Stop feeling things all the time. It's the beginning that... I'll play it again. You're out of tune. Me too. You too? How nice. Coffee? Is it Lavazza? Lavawhat? My mom only drinks Italian. Lovely country. No coffee then? No, just visiting. Starts here! Hot and cold on all floors, it's more intimate. - No coffee? - It's not Lavazza. Have to go! Why? - Why? - Indeed. But our coffee! The music doesn't suit. We're disturbing! - Of course we are. - Of course. But why, after all? It happens, more often than you think! Then we'll leave. And so will we. Not finishing your coffee? Now it's cold. I can microwave it. If it's no bother. Not at all. Follow me, visit the rest of the duplex. I read someone dried their cat in the microwave. It died. Charming neighborhood, if you'd like to visit it. It's real old Paris. We saw it on the way. - It's pretty mixed. - Men and women. And children. I told you, I don't want children. - Why not? - Not your business. Sorry, it was out of general interest. General interest? It interests me to know why folks don't want kids. - It's of no interest. - Kids? No, whether or not. It's not general, it's personal. I don't want any clue to space... and time. Where to put them? - They don't take that much space. - Says you. A sleeping woman... So lovely to see. A picture of bliss. Desire is beautiful. Very beautiful. When we met, you said: "You are my only, mother of my children". It was beautiful. I don't remember. Memory, it goes with age. You must exercise it. I exercise a lot, he doesn't. Me neither. You're like me. Not at all. What are you doing? You don't like me, so I'm airing. I may get to. It depends. On what? Tough question. Close that window, you'll wake her. I'd like you to answer me. I haven't answers to everything. I'm leaving. Off you go, then. You're staying? Not finished my coffee, it's too hot. Hold on. W, W“. There. Harder... That's better. Where are you going? I'm leaving. I feel you should accompany your wife. Your wife needs you. She's desperate. Yes, I know. It runs very deep. Life, an unhappy childhood, never gotten over it. Sixth ﬂoor. Charlotte, someone rang. Can you look after Mr Delacre, Mom? A pleasure! Like a coffee? All electric and no load-bearing walls! I was already told. Sorry, I'm early, but I couldn't wait. First, the upstairs! You seem proud to be pregnant. Could be. - When? - Next week. So soon! Mind if I touch? - Everyone does. - It's big! That's the idea. And you? - What? - You pregnant? I doubt it. That happens. But when you are, you are! That's why we want to move, for more space. Sex in front of kids isn't Freudian. You often make love? Every day. You must like it. You get used to it. And you? I quite like it, but I've no lover. So not much chance to make love. No, but I think about it a lot for my work. I see. I never think about it. - The baby can sleep in here. - Perfect. I don't want kids. - Don't say anything terrible. - It's a fact. You're lucky to want sex for work. I just said I thought about it. So sometimes it makes me want it. And what do you think of? Dirty stuff... Well, I try. Like what? Stuff like dick, cunt, ass! That's all? Well I guess it's the basics. Why have you no lover? I guess I'm too busy. - Ever been in love? - I think so. You think? I think I'm always in love. - With who? - No one special. It's an overall feeling. And you? Me, never! I wasn't even in love with my husband. He asked, I couldn't refuse, and before I knew it, bingo! Maybe it's for the best. Thinking doesn't make kids. - You're very pretty. - You're very kind. - You'll come visit me? - If you want. I do. I'm scared stiff of giving birth. With the epidural you don't feel a thing. So they say. I don't want kids. I just don't... Relax. Come lie down in my room. Want I call your husband? No. What, then? Speak to me. Of what? Your thoughts when you feel desire. No, you're too young... Young and old. You're crying? Yes, it's the chicken. A matter of chicken, if you see what I mean. Yes, well I think so... The baby can sleep here. All alone. Too bad. Perfect. That way you can make love in peace. Yes, in peace. It's a girl. Only boys on my husband's side. He says we'll have another. He's proud when I come. Yet it's my orgasm. Don't want kids. I better get up, or I never will. I like it here with you. You look at me so kindly, no desire, nothing. It's restful, feels so good. What? Standing? Yes. Coffee? And what about the palpitations? You don't look like you make love daily. I've big needs. A drag, all these needs. Why? They enslave you. What'll I do with them when she's giving birth? In sum, you'd like less. In sum, yes. Sit darling. Don't stand, you'll lose it. Feels so good here. So it's 165 sq. Meters in all? Yes, and all electric. I'd switch the bathroom with the kitchen. Buying then? I like a bright kitchen, less risk of accidents. And all electric... The bathroom. Fewer suicides with gas. So good... My mom's downstairs, she'll show you the rest. Must be great to live with one's mom. Stairs are dangerous for babies. No! How do you know? It's been proven. I was a baby too. - And a beautiful one! - Mom. A pleasure! Make yourself at home. Hot and cold on all ﬂoors. No load-bearing walls. Got imagination? Mr Delacre. He's visiting too. And you think it'll hold? You think it'll hurt? It might. I'll die. If I don't, he'll start over. Birth changes men. And for couples they say moving is the end. - Of what? - The couple! You reckon? I can't wait to move! Gotta go to your prenatal class. We'll come back tomorrow. Bye! Until tomorrow! May I take a last look around? I love your painting! Yeah, nice. What size is it? Is it expensive? Be right down. Another tax bill! Don't blame me! I'm waiting. - I'll tell him. - No, don't. He's contemplating art. Found this in your wardrobe. Thank you. So I'll say nothing. Yes, tell him. No, don't! I'm going. But I want to wait. I understand. No, you can't. He's a terrible man. I no longer love him. Yes, I do. I always will. I'm going. What time is it? Four o'clock. Didn't see the time pass. I must be off! Well? It won't be a quick sale. Too many flowers! I want to leave my wife. I like her. Nice eyes. At first, yes, but after. Want to live alone? - It scares me. - Why? Week-days, it's okay. But I need a presence on Sundays. On Sundays? Sunday's market clay, I like to buy a lot. For example, if I ask for half a chicken or a leg, I feel their scorn. They think I'm a loser, all alone. Not scorn, pity. How smart you are and sensitive! No, I like to say: "Your best free-range chicken!" So they think I've guests and I'm health conscious. - What time is it? - Four thirty. Already? - Come about the ad? - For the studio. It's block C, entrance D. - Let's go. - Okay. Want to live in a studio? No, just occasionally. I already have a place. Me too, but I need calm. Yes, me too. And solitude. Me too. My place is so busy. Mine too, it's like a millrace. I have kids, a husband, a maid. She's adorable, but overly. They're all adorable, my kids, my husband, but overly. Yes, overly, I know. Yum, willy. I need a place to make a coffee and drink it alone over a quiet cigarette. A place where I'm asked no questions. You get asked that many? Oh, sorry. Doesn't matter, I'm used to it. My husband wants to know all. Soto please him, I invent. I dream of my young girl's studio. Where I'd write my journal, or poetry. If the place inspired me. Write any poetry? Only prose, and not any old kind. On commission. I hate it. I see, realist prose. I too hate reality. Reality? A certain reality to be sought within. In one's own experience, as my mom says. Poetry must be sought within too. "Sobs of my heart-string violins..." "Wound my heart with languor..." So terribly erotic. You think so? It's here. I'd so love to have been a writer too. Good clay, ladies. This way. It's not big, but the view adds space. A bay window changes everything. - I'll bath at home. - Me too. - It's empty. - Of course. What calm! And no smells. No drawbacks. What intimacy! Without questions. Like it? - We have to think it over. - Sure. - For the double curtains. - And the hot tank. I know. It's meant for one, so for two... 50 liters isn't much. Especially for clean people. I'd just need a table, a chair and a lamp so as to write. Me, an armchair, a coffee table, a coffee maker and I'd be in peace. Yes, I too need some peace. You write every day? Mornings only. Afternoons, I sell. Mornings, I sleep. Or pretend to. So, let's be practical. Yes, let's. You mornings, me afternoons? We could take it together? Yes. And at nights? It'll stay empty, unless... We find a third person. That'd only complicate. I'd like we never meet again. Never? Not even for coffee? It's nothing personal, but I already know so many, so many people. I know, enough is enough. I'd be the last straw. I understand your need for solitude. I'll always come at two. I'll always leave at one. Thank you so much. My visits! At last, you're here! You too, and your husband? He went to buy a cot. I was at a loose end and as I found you so nice, I came back. Hope I'm not bothering? Sorry to bother you! Just to see if the chicken needs basting. My mom. When she thinks she's bothering, she's welcome. No bother. I love chicken. So did my dad. He adored it! Roast chicken, tarragon chicken! What an oven! Don't you think it smokes a lot? Hadn't noticed. The whole place smells of chicken. - It bothers you? - Not you? Maybe, but it's not as bad as fish. You say that because you're pregnant. I love fish, reminds me of the sea. The North Sea. - And with it? - As accompaniment? Potatoes, salad, cheese and ice-cream. Nice and light. Fairly... Like a coffee? Not with the chicken. I'll leave you. I don't like to intrude when she has friends. That smell gets to me. It doesn't bother you? - No, makes me hungry. - Not cooked yet. Doesn't matter. I really like your apartment. I feel at home nowhere, but here I feel good. I've never felt so good in an apartment. Me too, I feel at home nowhere. - Not even here? - Deep down, no. But it's wonderful here. You think? I have no taste. You have perfect taste. I have to go. When can I retourné? In the morning? No, I'll be at my studio. Tomorrow afternoon. I feel better, more rested. I'm happy for you. What's the matter? It's that smell. The chicken? No. The flowers? Yet we didn't fumigate here. It's coming from here. May I? It's the onions! No... Thyme... There's thyme on the chicken. Yes, my mom puts thyme everywhere. Chicken with thyme, that brings back memories. Memories of nature, and nature... Nature? - I abhor nature. - You too? You too? I abhor nature and memories. When people reminisce, they talk of their grandmothers. I hate grandmotherish people, and oak wardrobes, and chicken too, sometimes. Yet it's so tasty. Yes, but I hate tears. I'd rather forgo chicken for good. - If it's me, I'll dry my tears. - No, too late. Should be done by now... Is that better? It's your condition... We cry at the drop of a hat. We know that with a child life will never be the same, eh? Yes, that's exactly right. I love when we have guests. It's such a pleasure, so party-like. I love parties, going out, laughing, drinking, dancing! Stay for dinner if you like, there's chicken! Love to. Sure smells good! It's the thyme! Yes, that smell of thyme is unmistakable. What's up? I can't eat it. I think of grandmothers, memories, nature and oak wardrobes. You never knew your grandmother. That's just it. Hello, it's about the apartment again? Not taking it. We've split up for good. Well, I'll be off. - Smells really good. - It's the thyme. But you're eating. Doesn't matter. It does. I hate being bothered eating, when I'm hungry. - You hungry? - Starving. - Have some chicken. - Love some. Not much left, but stay, it'll be more party-like! Take my plate, I'm not hungry. - But it's your chicken! - No matter. Really? Is it nice? Won't go down. Needs a little salt. No, it's not that... What, then? Too much thyme? Too many memories? It's a bit cold. Then I'll microwave it. Know the story of the cat? Ah, you know it. A sad tale. Takes away my appetite. I wonder what she's doing. I need air. Who? My wife. We've just split up. What a pity! I lived 41 years with my husband. And you split in the end? Yes, he died. How? No more chicken? No. In dreadful pain. Only natural. Know a good hotel nearby? Yes, the Holiday Inn. You sure it's good? I'll nip home for a few things, but I don't want to meet her. I understand. But what'll you do? I don't know. Can I wash my hands? That greasy chicken... Yes, it's a matter of skin. Come with me. A clean towel, to dry with. You're so incredibly kind. You're mistaken. I've a flair for recognizing kind people. Your hands aren't greasy? How do you do it? It's incredible! - I'll leave you. - So soon? To wash your hands in peace. Adorable! Nice apartment. Especially the bathroom. I measured the bath. A bit small for me. But the apartment's too big for me alone. What a dinky hat! Really comfortable armchair. True... Armchair... the armchair... Looks pretty good... "The fuses have blown..." "Limply hoovering..." "Claudia's glistening skin mirrored his blazing body..." Like the chicken! Find it pornographic? Not pornographic, just funny. You have real comic talent! Comic? Well, I never... I gotta call the hotel. Here's the phone. I have my mobile, mustn't impose. I hope they've shaving cream, a razor. Have to be fresh for work tomorrow. Here, you're women only. Hello, I'd like a room... Yes, since my husband's death. Why? You don't have a razor. There's dad's. Charlotte, don't mention that. He wouldn't have thought twice! Of doing what? Lending his razor to someone in need. He'd have given the shirt off his back! So be it! Follow me. Comic? This razor's 30 years old. And the elastic's gone. You'll bring it back tomorrow? You like this old stuff? Yes, it's so precious to me. When stuff is old, I junk it. It's more hygienic. Like my husband, especially now. Our place is so empty... And emptiness, is so terribly sad. Terribly. Terribly. You play so well! You think so? Well, I'm off. Think I should call my wife? No, it's better this way. Only, she already had an unhappy childhood. And now an unhappy adulthood, not to mention old age. I love old age, hate youth and detest children. The worst is old age. I hope I never grow old. You will and no one will want you. You sure? Men always find someone new. Well, I'm off. I'll give you a lift. I hadn't finished the oven, I don't want to go. But I'm sure my husband is calling every hospital. Let's go then. Thanks again. Loved the chicken. Goodbye, goodbye! Shouldn't have given him the case. Think he'll bring it back? Think he'll wear the underpants? Sure, don't worry. I've no reason to. None. I'm worried. - About what? - The underpants. What of it? It was your dad's. I feel like I'm cheating on him. It happens. But I never did. And now I'm cheating on him with Mr Holiday Inn! Go to bed, it'll pass. I Will. And you? Me too. I'll be lonely without the case. Tomorrow, I'm seeing a house to rent. Big, not expensive and not too far from Paris. It still smells. - What? - The chicken. Yes, even the sheets smell. Want a hand to change them? Yes, I hate sleeping in smelly sheets. I want to sleep with you tonight. I can't bear sleeping without the case. I'll see to my toilette and I'll be right with you. You asleep? I need to talk. I'd so like to confide in you. You heard what Delacre said about old age? Didn't you find it a bit out of place? Yes. Want to know what I think? He's right. Old age is the worst. But when you're old, you're not aware of that. You feel young, and then one clay you realize you're old. What do you think? Why are you getting up? I can't sleep. Me neither. Mom, don't get up. It'd calm me to tidy the kitchen. I was just going to. Why? To calm me. Then I'll stay in bed. Mom, when we move, promise me one thing. What? That you'll sleep in your bed. Of course. Separate bedrooms, far from the kitchen, on different ﬂoors. Just like here. Are you coming? What's that, Charlotte? I don't know. Mrs Delacre found it in the wardrobe. It's my mother's journal, your grandmother's... Her name was Tosca. I didn't know it existed. All had vanished... She, there... Everything. But you're here. Yes, I was born there. At the end, when the Americans saved me... That's all I remember. It's a miracle, that I'm here, that you're here. Try to read, it's in Polish. I'll try, but... Look at that face, how wonderful! "I am a Woman." Exclamation mark. "As I am a woman,." "I cannot say all that I feel," "my memories," "my secrets, my thoughts aloud..." "I can just suffer in silence." "I can just speak to my pages" "sure that no one can read it." "You will be my only confidant." "You will never betray me..." Your father taught me Polish. He loved it. Odd, no? What is really wonderful is this portrait. It's so... That gaze, that face... those big, dark eyes... She was an artist, a true artist... Tasha Ehrenberg, 1924. He said to me: Undress, ready-to-go. Well proportioned. All electric. Feet that stink. Claudia's glistening skin mirrored his body. At the end of the corridor was an old armchair. On the armchair, two naked bodies intertwined... Hoover... That awful double curtain business. Comic? I find it sad. Again! Again, Yves, again! Again, Yves... Yes... More, Daniel, more! What calm! It's the weight of the body that matters. But I'm heavy. Not enough. Don't lift your shoulders. - Like so? - Yes, that's it. Supple... and heavy! He hasn't returned with the case. He will, they always do. You think so, Samuel? I'm sure of it. Mom, I'm going to bed. Be right with you! C Sharp... Cunt, ass, dick. Cunt, ass, dick. It's taking shape. Again! Again, Yves, again! Until tonight. Don't forget the chicken. Yes... More, Daniel, more! Don't forget the fish. It's not bad at all! What imagination! I was really inspired yesterday. "Sorry, Charlotte." "I couldn't help myself, it was so tempting." "Claudia's such a beautiful character. So sensual, so inspiring." "Michèle." Inspiring? Smells musty! The countryside! Ajax! No, The White Tornado! Pure air. No dust. No, almost none. The ﬂoor is well waxed. The curtains are clean. There's room for a concert piano. Not quite the region. What silence! I'm cold. What calm! This chair's comfortable, but too deep. The house is rented unfurnished. Don't do that! Baby didn't even finish his milk. What emptiness! What space! And this worktop! Even has a microwave, quite rare. And all gas. Heard about the wet cat? Dried in the... Seen the spit? It'd cook 2, even 3 chickens! Infra-red, with... auto-cleaning. - But she can't have cooked much. - Never. - In fact, she left. - I understand. Sophie left, husband and child. - I understand. - What exactly? Almost empty. - Can be filled. - If you're hungry. I am. It's the country air. Any drawbacks? Don't know. I guess so, or else why did Sophie leave? She wouldn't be Sophie Delalleux, by any chance? No, Sophie Dormoy. The hairdresser's daughter. She was in my class in primary. She could outrun the boys, a real rebel. Even cooking must've gotten to her. I'm sure she fed the kid on pasta and mash. Or on frozen burgers, boiled eggs. That's rebellion too. True, never struck me. That's rebellion too. But it's not very intimate without double curtains. Love, eroticism, it wasn't every clay. I'm sad. - Me too. - But why? No explaining it. A child alone, is sad. Especially with no dog, in the country. All it needs is a little music! May I? I never married because of Sophie. Me neither. You're like me. Often the case with only children. I have the same. Still more to see. He mustn't have seen it coming, or why the bath? Or he did see it coming. Sophie is tiny! The bathroom and kitchen don't go with the rest. All a matter of taste. - How big is the hot tank? - No idea. The bath makes bubbles. I adore that! It massages. So at night, when you're dead beat... - No need to go to a spa. - No need. Kitchen and bathroom don't fit the rest. I've said it already, but it's true. Maybe that's why Sophie left. Yes, too much disparity. The kitchen view is exquisite. There are cows! Now man and child live in a little flat in Fontainebleau. This is too big for a man to manage alone. - You agree? - Yes, cleaning's a drag. I too live in an apartment. And you? Me too. It's easier living alone. Why don't you get married? Haven't found anyone. Could still happen. I still think of Sophie. And maybe she of you. She never thought of me, always outran me. She wasn't for me. Th' “y... The living room's ideally proportioned. And the bedroom, such comfort and intimacy! So, you're keen. A look outside? Yes, but don't put yourself out. She left this way, with her little case. Who? Sophie. How do you know she had a case? How long gone, I wonder? Alone or with someone else? Alone or not, who can say? No one. Did she prepare, or did she just take off? Did she feel too alone in that silent house? See how they stare at me. Now they're talking to me. What can they be saying? I always loved cows. They're so peaceful. Look at that sunset, that light. Morbid... A husband working in Fontainebleau, leaving her alone all day. Look at these sham sheep. Almost like goats, don't you think? I never had the chance to look so long at sheep. I wonder if they really are sheep. Maybe they're goats. No, goats are white. I think... And sheep, beige. No, golden... I reckon the child was a boy, of about 4 or 5. Sophie couldn't yet confide in him. Sometimes she'd take a bath with him. She wanted to think, or daydream, or not think. But not him. He wanted to play, splash about, ask questions why. Did she hear him? She'd answer curtly: "That's the why!" - "But why?" - "Enough!" "Why?" - You should write. - I do. Not that, novels! Realist novels. Eroticism is realist too, when you know life. Behind every door there are men and women crying: "Yes, again!" Yes, I know. Claudia untied Serge from the bed and said: "Goodbye... I mean, Adieu." "We've clone everything possible, believe me, Serge," "except dying-." "So, now Serge, we'll see each other no more..." The End. Thank you Michèle, thank you! A Day in the Country. Like the countryside? I love it! Here it is. Still selling? I'm interested. Another look? It's so pretty. That bath! And this room! What a view! That kitchen! And it smells so good! We'll be so happy here! Room for at least three kids! You back with your wife? No, I've fallen in love. She's... - Beautiful! - How'd you know? And... - Gentle! - Yes, and... - Sensitive! - Yes, yes! - You know her? - No. I really like you too. Only sometimes you're too... Too... You're too sensitive. And too... Too pull. Pure? Can I see the rest? What a vibe! My God! She's giving birth! An ambulance! She's giving birth! Hot water! Hot water and clean towels! We'll call him Simon. But it's a girl. Silly me. Well then, Simone. Didn't feel a thing. It's mine, I recognize it! My baby! My little Virginia! Smile for your daddy! Where's my wife? What've you done with her? Where's my wife? Bye! More to the right... To the right. You okay? Pregnant again? No, not yet. I want to live here with you. Never felt so good anywhere. Here? With me? But I write! So? I'll get used to it. It's not an illness. Rim-alumna mun. Now there's room. Like a coffee? No, tea, please. Not too strong, with sugar. Thus they lived, for years, may be. The one a writer minding the baby. Calling it Simon, sometimes Simone. The other, dancing, living over. Young girl's dreams with no lover. With its two moms, the child did grow. And liked nothing better, than blow by blow. To type on its real, fake mom's laptop. Filthy words, slipped into its ear. By grandparents, so very dear. Like: Prick, ass, dick! By grandparents, so very dear. Like: Prick, ass, dick! One noting all the child did say. Its first steps on awkward feet. Its first words and milk teeth. Its first gurgles and first mamas. While the other at times was head in the stars...
