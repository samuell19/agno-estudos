[mysterious music playing] [woman] Why do we love treasure so much? Are we driven by the mystery behind it? The secrets hidden in the dark? Or the dangers lurking around every corner? [mysterious music continues] [engine revving] [engine shuts off] [mysterious music continues] [gasps, scoffs] Toledo steel. What a thing of beauty. [tense music playing] [panting] So, Petersen, do you need some help there? No. [man] The treasure will be mine this time. You'll see. BASED ON THE NOVEL OF THE SAME NAME BY ZBIGNIEW NIENACKI The first rays of sunshine in Liepāja should appear right around two o'clock. [wind whistling] Five. [metal clattering] Seven. But what if you stopped the sun at two? [grunts] The cross. Ah, I thought that maybe we would like to watch the sunrise together. In that case, adios, señor Tomasz. [grunts] Tomek! [Tomasz grunts] So, who's the one that needs help now, my friend? - [Tomasz] Watch out! - [Petersen grunts] [tense music playing] [blade rasps] [Tomasz grunts] All right, you win! The Red Army carted away treasures from all over Europe. The ones they couldn't move were hidden away. I found some letters amidst an old soldier and a fence. They wrote about the lighthouse in Liepāja and how it always seems to stop at 2:00 a.m. What? See for yourself. [screaming in pain] [both grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [wind whistling] [tense music playing] Oh yeah. [tires squealing] [dramatic music playing] [tires squealing] [snickers] You wanna play, Petersen? [engine revving] See ya! - Huh? - [grunts] [music stops] [groans] [laughing] [chuckles] [wind gusting] [seagulls squawking] [ethereal music playing] [engine rumbling] [engine sputtering] [sputtering stops] [seagulls squawking] [water burbling] [laughs] [coughs] [panting] [engine rumbling] MR. CAR AND THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR NATIONAL MUSEUM [Tomasz] The cross leads to the treasure. And the treasure probably consists of unbelievable riches brought back from the Crusades. [crowd gasps in awe] [man 1] Wow! The authenticity we can confirm by de Molay's signature, which is visible in the ruby. Truly amazing. You mean me or the cross? [crowd laughs] And what treasures might this cross lead us to, sir? The Holy Land was a melting pot of religions and cultures. Its catacombs held monuments that were over a thousand years old, countless priceless artifacts, and relics of unusual power. Whatever de Molay found down there is of extraordinary value. Yes. Did de Molay bring this treasure back to Europe? After coming back to Europe, de Molay was charged with heresy by the King of France, Philip the Fair. He was then imprisoned and burned. [man 2] So, what happened to the treasure? The legend has it that de Molay managed to hide the treasure, and the cross leads to it. The front of the cross is decorated with Latin characters, and under the horizontal bar, there is an inscription. [in Latin] "Ubi thesaurus tuus ibi cor." [in English] Meaning? Meaning "Your treasure is where the heart is." The text cuts off 'cause part of the cross is missing. I hope you'll forgive me, but the treasure won't find itself. - [crowd laughter] - Thank you for this. Great turnout. Excuse me! [man 3] A couple more questions, if you would. [crowd murmuring] You don't know how to decode the inscription and find the treasure, do you? Of course I do. The treasure will soon be displayed, available for you to see in this museum. Thank you. Let's hurry up. The boss doesn't have much time. Don't worry, Pieniążek. Gierymska can wait. - How's your wife and kids? - [laughs] Thank you very much. I have neither. But I don't feel lonely, and you certainly won't either. Excuse me. Why do you hunt for treasure? You have to find them, right? For your ego. Sorry, the press conference is over. I prefer direct communication. I'm writing an article about treasure and why we're drawn to it. Will you agree to an interview? You wanna talk to a narcissist who basks in the glow of relics? So you've been reading my articles. Did you enjoy them? Apparently, I'm only able to love exhibits. Then perhaps you better sit for an interview and let the people see a different side of you while having some coffee and good company. [chuckles softly] I prefer exhibits. And you wanna know why I look for treasure? Because I don't like to give up. But apparently, with you, it's the other way around. Pieniążek! [whimsical music playing] [whistle blowing] - [children clamoring] - [man] Morning assembly! Let's go! Let's move it! Time to stretch! Let's do it! Come on! [woman] Hey! What are you doing? You're supposed to be peeling potatoes. Right now! [scoffs] Jeez, this kid can't even peel potatoes. TEMPLAR TREASURE Holy smokes! The lost cross of de Molay! Hey, orphan kid! What are you doing here? This morning you told me to get lost, or else you'd puke, so... You're just reading while the rest of us are in "pertinent" conflict with the Reds? It's "permanent," you know? Don't you interrupt me. That's what I said. You wanna be a little boy and read newspapers until you die, or do you wanna be a man and join a club for the real men, where I'm the scout leader? When I grow up to be a real man, aren't I gonna go bald though? What? No, we don't go bald. - Then I wanna belong to the club. - Attention! [thunder rumbling] [coughs] What's that bad smell? [boy 1 chuckles] Humanity. All right, give me that. Smells like yesterday's pea soup. All right. The sooner we finish, the sooner we become a part of the... [coughs] "...real" men's club. Wonderful. I can hardly wait for that day. I hate to disappoint you, compadre, but you can't join. Ha! You're already in one. You're in the club for losers! [chuckles] - You were sent here for being losers? - And why'd they send you here? For being a woman, of course. We never had it easy in this country. Sh! One, two... Five Reds coming from the east. - We have to warn our side! - "Our side"? You mean those idiots who banished us to poop duty? Well, this is our poop, and no Red is gonna spit in its face! Maybe they'll finally take to us. [indistinct chattering] [boy 1] We lost to the Reds again! All 'cause of those losers. Hey, losers! I see a couple of very smelly weeks in your future. Don't worry. You'll get used to it. I've had enough! I'm not really surprised, you know. Only the fourth wave of feminism will change anything. Hold on there, mon ami. You can change the name of the club. No! We have to find the treasure! Look, you guys! That's the cross of the Templar Grand Master, Jacques de Molay! Supposedly, the key to finding the treasure. They say the treasure contains incredible riches that they'd taken throughout the Crusades. [girl] Wow! [boy 2] Mr. Tomasz is awesome! He's found lots of treasure. This one was in the Baltic Sea! [Pieniążek] What's with these journalists? Never a moment's peace. Pieniążek, why don't you tell me what the boss is planning for me? - Perhaps she'll tell you herself. - Talk. A partner. - [sighs] - Last time, you barely made it back home. The boss is worried about you. [grunts] Vacation! [Tomasz] The last mission was basically a vacation. You gotta give me tougher assignments so I can stay in shape. [pensive music playing] Do you have any ideas where the treasure might be? The inscription is the key. I just have to find out whose heart it refers to. [Gierymska] Do you know her? She was at the presentation of the cross. She goes by the name of Laima. The Baltic goddess of fate in the form of an old woman. Cute. She owns a holiday resort in Miłkokuk in Podlachia. She claims to be a descendant of the Yotvingians, and she collects valuable artifacts related to them. If we're talking about her because she owns a resort, and you think I need a vacation, don't even bother. The last mission was a vacation. She wants to find the treasure, and she claims the de Molay cross isn't the only one. Check her out. Quietly. She's over at the Bristol. I was able to find out about your man. [Tomasz] Gaspar Felippe. [Gierymska] Originally from Buenos Aires. He's a jewelry thief. He's such a good thief, he's earned himself the nickname "Adiós" because he leaves everyone behind. I guess he'll have to change his nickname. [Gierymska] A couple years ago, he went off the grid. But as you can see there, he rather enjoys taking lives. Dohnal from the Prague Museum. Eveline from the Belgian Archaeological Society. Metz from Denmark. Cutting out the competition. He's not alone. You're going to need some help. [chuckles softly] I have you and my car. That's enough. Have a good trip. - Take care, Pieniążek. - Mm-hmm. WELCOME PARENTS [soothing acoustic guitar music playing] HEADQUARTERS [boy] Holy smokes! I guess you could say it's like a symbol they put on all the tents. [grunts] Oh, hey! Come on! No, it's just... - [woman] What's with him? - I don't know. [distant siren blaring] [indistinct chattering] [door lock clattering] [wind gusting] DEAR GUEST [gasping, grunting] [funky music playing] [grunting, groaning] [both grunting] [phone ringing] [Tomasz grunts] Ah. Neman Glassworks from the interwar period. Designed by Morawski. Beautiful. [grunts] [both grunting] [Tomasz] A fake! That's perfect! [grunts] [funky music continues] [grunts] [toilet flushing] [muffled screaming] Tomek, you know, kid, I really do have better things to do than keep saving your life all the time. I could've handled them. - [Petersen chuckles] - [Tomasz groans] [Tomasz groaning] I was here first. You are invited to lunch in the hotel restaurant. - Tomorrow. - Twelve past twelve. [grunts angrily] Do you have any family? We're not even partners yet, and you're already proposing? 'Cause I have a daughter. For the first time in my life, I regret not spending more time with her. But on the other hand, I feel like I could really leave her something. You're afraid. And you know something. So, who was that? Secret organization. Intelligence. I really don't know. But I know one thing. I know someone's been killing treasure hunters. Tomek, the treasure hunting game is over. Doesn't the cross lead to the treasure? What de Molay discovered in the Holy Land was something with immense power. Something that could change the course of history. Everyone wanted it. Kings, popes. Everyone. Philip the Fair arrested de Molay. He wanted the treasure. And he got his hands on part of it. You know why the Hundred Years' War didn't start till Philip was dead? Because Europe was afraid of him. That one part of the treasure could annihilate entire armies. Just think what the entire thing's capable of, huh? The treasure's a weapon. A weapon, a plague, magic. I wish I knew. I only know it's incredibly powerful. It has the power to destroy Europe. Tomek, give it up. Petersen, you're getting old. So, how about we team up, huh? - We're doing pretty well. - [laughs] You know very well I always work alone. I'll see you tomorrow. At twelve past twelve. [panting] [unsettling music playing] [grunts] Petersen. [somber music playing] - [Adiós in Spanish] Grant him happiness... - [in English] You coming? - [Adiós in Spanish]...light, and peace. - [in English] Let's go. [Adiós in Spanish] After passing through death... [in English] Right now! [Adiós in Spanish]...he will participate with all the saints in the eternal light as you promised Abraham and his descendants. Amen. [kisses rosary beads] [in English] Hit him. Hit him, now. [grunts] And now apologize. Apologize to my son. I'm so sorry. He's forgiven you. - [body thuds] - No more mistakes from now on. Eliminate anyone who tries to get in our way. [in Spanish] Is that clear? [insects chirping] [breathing heavily] [gasps] [in English] Oh! [exhales] Are you having a snack? What? Oh, no. It was just a precaution. Good idea. A camp full of adolescent boys is truly a dangerous place. - What are you doing here? - You've been in here all day. And alone. Well, I've been thinking a lot about the treasure. Without us? Well, you were busy with your parents. I didn't wanna bother you. How come? Your folks didn't come? Yeah, it was about seven years ago. [girl sighs] [owl hooting] Listen. Don't say we were busy or that you didn't wanna bother us because we're a team now, and we do everything together, right? [pensive music playing] FAMOUS TREASURE HUNTER PETERSEN KILLED NATIONAL MUSEUM ARCHEOLOGIST SURVIVES CAR BOMB ATTACK! [indistinct chattering] [Laima] Twelve past twelve. I respect punctuality in people. And I have no respect for people who bomb cars. Especially with my friends inside. I abhor violence, too, but I sometimes forgive breaking into hotel rooms. I respected Petersen. It was my hope that the three of us would meet today. And why should I trust you? I ordered you some hot cocoa. I hear you're fond of it. I prefer the Templar cross to cocoa. You claim that de Molay's cross isn't the only one. Sounds like a bluff. From generation to generation, a legend has been passed down in my family... [unsettling music playing] ...about a Teutonic Knight who, while traveling through our ancestral lands, left a cross... identical to the one that you found. [scoffs] Still sounds like a bluff. The Teutonic Knights and the Yotvingians never did get on well. [Laima] Exactly. This Knight was afraid for his life, and he knew Philip the Fair wouldn't look among the Yotvingians. You're not the only one who knows Philip the Fair wanted to get the treasure, but my ancestors hid the cross and left a clue for their descendants to find it. The museum has money to pay for the cross. I don't even know where it is. But I can still help if you lead me to the treasure and you share it with me. [chuckles softly] [sighs] [chuckles softly] A competition? Please. As the goddess of fate, you should already know that I'll find the treasure on my own. Whatever it is. Thanks for the cocoa. Goodbye. [exhales] [cheerful music playing on radio] [announcer] For many of us, this is the warmest and the most important symbol of the start of the summer and vacations. Time for levity, time for fun, time for making memories... Can somebody show me how to do this? ...of hot sandy beaches, or maybe the mountains and kayaks or bikes. Maybe even a folding one. And in the background, the obligatory... Mm. [laughs] Get a real knife. He tried to play with a pocketknife. - [boy 1] Oh, not this game. - [boy 2] No, it's my turn. [announcer] Today in our studio, we are joined by journalist and author, Anka Modzelewska, who has the latest scoop for us with new information on the search for the Templar treasure. Quiet. Do you hear that? [announcer] What news do you have for us? [Anka] It turns out that the Templar cross found... What a lucky twist of fate, right? Well, as a man of science, I don't believe in fate. As a feminist, well, I believe that fate is always patriarchal. [Anka] The mysterious Laima invites everyone to a competition in which one can discover the missing cross that leads to the famed treasure. All you have to do is get to the Yotvingian resort in Miłkokuk before sunset. Now, anyone can be a treasure hunter, not just the overrated Mr. Tomasz, who... I was listening. Uncle, have they even thought about this? That Adiós guy's probably headed there now! Just calm down. You can be in Miłkokuk in five hours. Better have a drink. I already put some in. Thank you. [machinery whirring] [uncle] Karol. So I repaired the dents as best I could, and any holes I welded up. I put in a new battery and added a couple technological innovations. - Should I show you how it works? - No, thank you. I'm not a child, but can these fold away somehow? Well, you never know when you might need to use them. Well, I know. Never. [uncle laughs] Mrs. Gierymska is worried about you. Then tell her to stop worrying because I've got extra seats. [uncle] It seems she may have other ideas. Ah... [cheerful music playing] A personal assistant? I really don't have time for things like that. I've heard a lot about you. It's an honor and a great responsibility to be your business partner. Franz. Responsibility is a stressful thing. - I hereby release you of it. - The director insisted. I would listen to her. [Franz] That's a weird-looking car. [chuckles] Does it even drive? [scoffs] Uh, well, we don't quite know, so... The very first thing that it needs... [grunts]...is a push. Go on. Push. [laughs] Faster. Go faster, Franz. [engine sputtering] [engine revving] I'm sure he just wants to warm up the engine. Right? That weird-looking car doesn't need to warm up. [Tomasz] Thank you, Uncle! [tires squealing] [cheerful music playing] Don't you think they'll look for all of us? [boy] If life has taught me anything so far, it's that no one ever looks for the losers. And we still have to lay low. Also, we're gonna need to pick out code names. Sure. Great idea. Hmm. My nickname used to be "Squirrel" back at my school, and I actually kinda like it, you know. "Squirrel"? Yeah, all right. And what name were you called? Moron, idiot, trash, or stinker. Stinker sounds the coolest. [cheerful music continues] [seat spring squeaks] [grunts] [engine sputters, stops] [motorcycle engine rumbles] - And don't you dare open up, pal. - [engine revs] You do know tailing someone requires discretion? [woman] It's true what they say. You're observant and witty. I hope you don't get your information from the Afternoon paper, or do you, Ms... I have other sources. Well, that's good to hear 'cause the media lies. Yes, by drastically overrating you and trusting you far too much. Well, excuse me. I always make scrambled eggs the next day. This time, there might not be a morning after. [motorcycle engine revving] [air hissing] WX0001. This one will stop. Hold on. Not this one. According to American scientists, one out of every ten drivers is a serial killer. I want you to call me Mentor, all right? - Hmm. - How could he see all those details? Mm, like an eagle. - You'll be called Eagle Eye. - [chuckles softly] [cheerful music playing] [sighs] To Mata Hari. [Anka] What is it that excites us about treasure hunting? Is it going into the unknown without fear or preparation? Entrusting our lives to the idea fate will guide us? Or maybe it's the journey full of adventures and numerous, let's say, surprises. [music stops] - [whispering] Is it stopping? - [Mentor] Yes! Quiet! Excuse me, ma'am. Our friend needs help. Please, come quickly! - [Mentor] She's coming. She's coming. - Really! Our friend has trichotillomania, and he needs to get to a special clinic in Miłkokuk right away. Miłkokuk? That's far. And what exactly is trichotillomania? I'll tell you. It's an illness where the sufferers can't resist the urge to pull out all their hair. Hmm. Interesting. [gulps] Just look at him. Maybe we should have a talk. Woman to woman. I'll be honest with you because honesty is often the best policy. Our troop leader sent us to Miłkokuk on a secret mission. Now that sounds a lot more believable. I guess this is about the Templar treasure? - Huh? - [gasps] How does she know? 'Cause I'm going there. So, then we're competitors? Why don't we team up? Who are you? I'm a journalist. I'm writing a story about the reasons people look for treasure. So... Wait, hold on. You were the one who announced the competition on the radio. Anka Modzelewska! The first female reporter for the Afternoon Courier! And then, even before that, an Olympic fencing prodigy! - [chuckles] Let's leave it at reporter. - Welcome to the team. [Mentor sighs] [funky music playing] [engine stops] [chickens clucking] I'll deal with this clown. [whirring] I've got a lot more toys here. Why don't you leave the lady alone? [screams, grunts] Ah, you see? I did warn him! [grunts] [both grunting] [rattling] [air hissing] [grunts] [snarls] [groaning] [grunts] [wheels spinning] [grunting] [air hissing] What in the heck? Why me? She attacked you. Why don't you go after her?

After that, no one gets in. [Tomasz] Excuse me. My apologies to have kept you all waiting. Traffic was horrible. I'll wipe that smile away, señor. Your boys said the same thing. Now they're in the gutter. Give it up, you hear? [man] Whoever perpetrates violence must leave. [unsettling music playing] [horn blaring] [soothing music playing] [wind chimes jingling] [rhythmic drums playing] [music stops] The Kurgans, so important to my ancestors and those who came before them, haven't seen such a worthy group in ages. We are pleased to welcome you. Renowned art historian Mr. Tomasz. [crowd murmuring] The International Association of Historians, the treasure hunters of Sweden, and also, Anka Modzelewska, the outstanding journalist, as well as the daughter of the legendary treasure hunter... Karen Petersen. You are here because you want to find the cross, which will ultimately lead you to the Templars' treasure. Only teams of six people may participate in the quest. Well, I guess I should have asked Gierymska for five more partners. [Laima] Whoever doesn't have a group must drop out. [crowd murmuring] Hello, sir. Uh, I'm Eagle Eye, and I'd like to invite you to join our team. I've got a lot of thoughts about the Templars' cross, which I... Three children and some washed-up reporter? Uh, no, thanks. [crowd murmuring] Time is almost up! Okay. [sighs] You do as I say, and everyone stays out of my way. - Understood? - Well, of course. I know that you're gonna ask, so I'll save you the trouble. - Yes, I'll join you guys. - But we don't know you. Oh, so you're the type of girl who waits for the third date, huh? What's your game? Ping-Pong, I would say. Your father's death wasn't enough for you? I don't need another one. [Laima] I'm very glad that most of you have managed to connect. [speaking Yotvingian] [in English] "May the fates be on your side." [pensive music playing] [owl hooting] [Anka] "Mr. Tomasz, the treasure hunter ruthless to villains and children alike." That's my next article. We must have something in common 'cause I don't see them here with you. They were exhausted. [Karen speaking Yotvingian] [in English] Roughly translated means, "Your treasure's in the heart of the Yotvingian." [Anka] Where else could the heart of a Yotvingian be if not in a sacred place? And the only sacred place here is this kurgan. Mm-hmm. Laima's deceiving us. There's truly nothing here. Well, I'm not sure I can trust you. It didn't go well for my father. Petersen was my close friend. [Karen] Mm-hmm. Well, I hope I never become one. You can count on it. - What? - Nothing. Forget about it. We won't be friends either. [mysterious music playing] [frog croaking] What do you think of the stars? I like Lennon. McCartney, not so much. Every single one is perfect. But together, they also create wonderful constellations. You won't convince me of your vision. I don't need any partners. And that is why you lack the perspective and insight to notice the obvious. "The obvious"? What's obvious is that your recklessness and that reporter's stupidity led Adiós here, and death. Petersen is dead. Could his daughter be next? [Laima pants] - Are you feeling all right? - Yes, yes, I'm fine. But you have to hurry because I don't know how much longer I can help you. Help me? You're the reason evil could win. I guess you're the good guy 'cause you always make choices that make the world a better place, that make people happier, and save lives? Sometimes the evil has to come out on top for the good to discover how they can be good. Here. [animal howls] - [man gasps] - [Adiós] Sh. Sh. [in Spanish] Good night, my friend. Good night. [mysterious music playing] [dogs barking in distance] [dogs barking nearby] [in English] You're the only one I can count on, pal. [unsettling music playing] [dogs barking in distance] [Eagle Eye screams] [panting] What happened? Adiós. He was here! It was just a nightmare. No one's there. I'm telling the truth! Sleep. But you'll come back if he does? [Tomasz sighs] [music fades] [Tomasz] Hey. [sighs] When I had bad dreams, my uncle would make us hot cocoa and sprinkle turmeric. I'd drink it fast and fall asleep in no time at all. Were you afraid of being alone... and the older boys shouting at you that no one would ever want you because you're a loser? Or of adults that say they'll be right back and then disappear forever? [melancholy music playing] [yawning] There, you see? Works like a charm. Finish your cocoa and run along back inside. Can I sleep out here? I won't have bad dreams. Scout's honor. [tense music playing] Here, take a look. The de Molay cross. I've been thinking that it could be a guidepost. After all, "N"... Means north. But what about the other letters? X, L? You're right. Let's get some rest. Holy smokes! Out here, you can see all the stars perfectly. Perspective. [animal howling] [Eagle Eye] And the others? What about our team? [Tomasz] A good treasure hunter must take matters into his own hands. I don't have the perspective to see the obvious. [Eagle Eye] Excuse me? [Tomasz] The stones of the kurgan make the shape of a solar cross, the symbol of the goddess Saulė. [Eagle Eye] But what could that mean? The Baltic goddess Saulė was a patron of orphans. She was often portrayed in gold and in red, dancing, or riding a white horse. Hold on! The shield in Laima's tent had a drawing of a white horse. [chuckles] Very good. [Tomasz grunts] Let's go. [clapping] [in Spanish] Good work, my friends. - [in English] You wanna get socked again? - [chuckles] Take my advice, señor Tomasz. To eliminate someone, you gotta make sure they can't come back. Run for it. I'll take care of them. Come here. Come here, boy. Don't be afraid. Quick, run! Warn the others, and tell Laima! Come here. [groans] [panting] [grunts] I know where the cross is. Yeah? - Lead the way, then. - Okay. [animal howling] [groaning] Anka! Where's Eagle Eye? [Anka] I thought he was with you. - [fire crackling] - [sighs] Oh no. [panicked voices shouting] [dramatic music playing] The boy! He's still in there. I wasn't able... [coughing]...to get him out. [coughing] [Tomasz] Eagle Eye! [Tomasz coughing] Eagle Eye! [Tomasz coughing] - [panicked screams] - I don't know. Someone must've done this. [indistinct shouting] [Tomasz coughing] Eagle Eye! [coughs, grunts] Hey. [coughs] Everyone, go grab a bucket! [woman] Do something! [Eagle Eye coughing] I wanted... [coughs]...I wanted to take matters into my own hands. [breathing heavily] [wind gusting] EMERGENCY SERVICES [man] Oh. [man clears throat] [man] Is he your son? We received information from a nearby scout camp that, uh... - Yes, he's our child. - [man] Oh. - And the other two are both ours as well. - [man] But you really don't look like... Why doesn't this man believe you, Mommy? - Is he a chauvinist? - [man] Uh... In the future, please, at least try to be more responsible parents. Of course. Tomek, give your son your shirt. What's this all about? The shield had a cross inside identical to de Molay's! - And Karen was here. - Karen? What about her? Adiós. He snatched the cross and her too. Get dressed. - It seems you've lost something. - Then we have a problem, Mr. Tomasz. I did warn you. You still believe that you, alone, should be the only one to find the treasure, but you won't do it. And until you make your peace with that, you aren't going to be ready to search for it. But it's good that you trusted the children. Children are our strength. [chuckles] [breathes deeply] [pensive music playing] [music fades] What do you want? Adiós has the cross. He's headed for the treasure. We'll never find him. It's over. [engine starting] The cross had the full inscription! What? - Will you take us with you? - [sighs] Talk! [in Latin] "Ibi cor tuum." [in English] And the letter "E." Meaning east. So, maybe it is a guidepost? [in Latin] Ubi thesaurus tuus ibi cor tuum. [in English] Meaning, "The treasure lies where your heart is." Whose heart does it refer to? [Anka] There are two crosses. Maybe de Molay didn't discover the treasure himself but with a team? Yes. Jacques de Molay found the treasure. - In the ruby. - Sh! That means the cross was a guidepost for de Molay. That's why the ruby had his name in it. [sighs] So then, it's about his heart, but what could it be? Maybe one of the Templars' seats of power? Jerusalem? Cyprus? The cross was created during their downfall, but we're closer. There was a different signature in the ruby of the other cross. "Von Feuchtwangen." And you're just now sharing this? Von Feuchtwangen was Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. Incredible, but that means that the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and the Grand Master of the Templars were together on a crusade. Together they discovered the treasure. Von Feuchtwangen moved the Teutonic capital from Venice to Malbork because he wanted to protect the treasure. Malbork is the heart. - [Eagle Eye] Let's go, then. - [Tomasz] No, stop! Stop! I'm not rescuing you anymore. But we had a deal. We helped you, and you promised us! I'm not going back to the orphanage a loser without treasure. That's not an option! I don't have enough seats. [seat springs squeak] Ta-da! [funky blues music playing] Thanks a lot, pal. [engine starting] [funky blues music continues] [music continues over radio] - Since we're a team, now, and all... - We are not a team. [sighs] That's your opinion. Who says we're a team? You need a code name. We have more important things to deal with. I've got it! Mr. Big Ego. How about Mr. Artifact or Mr. Uptight? Mr. Tomasz is right. Assuming Adiós left four hours before we did and ignored all the traffic regulations... [chuckles] That would be safe to assume. ...we'd have to drive 310 km/h to arrive in Malbork right after he does. That's not gonna happen. [all screaming] Hey, I was just kidding! Oh, are you sure? I'm not Mr. Uptight? [all screaming] [Anka screams] [funky blues music playing] I've got a code name! How about Mr. Car? That's certainly not it. [funky blues music continues] [funky blues music fades] [unsettling music playing] I'll create a distraction so that you can get inside. No, they won't go after you. They'll hold back. Whoa, wait. Did you say snack? Mentor! I'll figure something out. [tense music playing] Ow! [thug 1] Did you do that? [both grunt] [Tomasz] Quickly, Go! - [Karen grunts] - Stop squirming around! [Karen grunts] Karen! You stay here. I'll handle this. - But we were... - I told you to stay here! Hey, stop! [Karen grunting] [tense music continues] [Karen grunts] [thug 2] Stop squirming around. [Tomasz groans] [music fades] [metal clattering] - You hear something? - What? No. The treasurer's chambers must be in the High Castle. - The vault has gotta be there, right? - That seems too easy. Mr. Tomasz said that the key is the inscription. "Your treasure is where your heart resides." Whose? - The Teutonic Knights? Or The Templars? - Or the castle itself! It's a place in the heart of the castle. Look out. [tense music playing] [Adiós] Where's the treasure? [grunts, coughs] [Tomasz chuckles] In the National Museum. In a few days. Don't worry. I'll get you an invitation. You're a fool, señor Tomasz. You want to lock up in a museum case, that which has power over life and death? Is there really no one you'd want brought back from the dead? No one at all? Should I feel bad for you? My son didn't deserve to die, you know? I need this treasure to get him back. You gotta help me out. [laughs] You're insane. [blade rasps] You'll die in agony, señor. No one will shed a tear for you 'cause you're alone. And your blind faith in all those shiny relics has brought you here. [grunts] [Tomasz grunts] [Tomasz grunts, groans] [door opens, closes] Why do you keep trying to save me? [groans] Don't flatter yourself. - [Karen] Hmm? - [grunts] Are you feeling guilty? Tell me where to find the treasure, and I'll forgive you. I don't need your fake forgiveness. You see, we might be able to help each other. [sighs] Please. Your charms aren't gonna work on me. [chuckles] They work on everyone. Look. - Leave me alone. - Look! Right here. Look down. But we go for the treasure together. Come on. - Hold on! - Come on. - Higher. - Hold on! Just wait. - Lift your leg higher. - [grunts] [both grunting] [Tomasz] No. [both grunting, panting] [thug] What's that noise? Hey! - What's going on? - It's not enough for you to kill us? You won't even let us have an intimate moment first? Get out of here right now! Ow! Why, you little brat! [Karen] Bravo, Squirrel [reverential music playing] [Eagle Eye] Holy smokes! The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary. [Tomasz] For a Knight of the Order, the church is the heart of the castle. You see? We really made it. Okay, then. Where's the treasure? The church consists of the vestibule, the transept, and, of course, the nave body. So, where could the heart be if it's not in the nave? If we assume that the crux of the nave is the body of the church, then the heart should be located somewhere... Somewhere... right here. [Tomasz] What you've missed, Mentor, is it doesn't have to be about a person. If an order knight considers the church the heart of the castle, then what's the heart of the church? Wherever you keep the body of Christ. Meaning? The altar. He's right. Hey, guess what. There's something you should know. The altar over there used to be somewhere else in the church. - [laughs] - Come on! Something you may have missed is that during von Feuchtwangen's reign, a chancel was actually added to the east. Originally, the altar used to be placed somewhere else. Meaning... [Mentor sing-songy] Right here. Right here. [boys knocking on door] [door opening] [mysterious music playing] [Eagle Eye] There's some inscription. - Maybe it's a clue? - [Karen] It's not an inscription. It's a number. Twelve hundred twelve. [Tomasz] Laima wanted to meet at twelve past twelve. [Squirrel] Maybe it's a date? One thousand two hundred twelve. The Children's Crusade. They sent pure-hearted orphans to join them. Saulė is the patron of orphans. What does it mean? [Squirrel] Hey. - Hmm. - [Tomasz] Well done, Squirrel. Sorry. Please forgive me. Hurry up! Go! It looks like some kind of workshop. There were six identical crosses. Laima wanted the teams to have six members. Six people left on a secret mission to the Holy Land. They found a treasure of enormous power. [wind gusting] They divided it into six parts to shield it from the evil of this world. That secret was hidden in a vault, and each cross was a guidepost leading to it. And we must be in the chamber of the vault's designer. The evil wasn't from far away. It was in their midst. Philip the Fair used his part of the treasure to murder and destroy. He couldn't decipher the inscription, so he decided to find out what his companions knew and kill them. [emotional music playing] [grunts] Philip the Fair united together with de Molay and von Feuchtwangen to the Holy Land, and he belonged to the Order of the Knights of the Tau. History doesn't tell us this. So Adiós wants to finish what Philip the Fair started. And then unleash another war. And sow destruction. No. Nobody is sowing anything. The treasure's not here. Yeah, but Adiós will be soon. Let's go. Quickly. Let's go. Hurry, hurry! Let's go! [Tomasz grunts] The party's over. There's no treasure. All you'll find is Philip the Fair turning in his grave. Try to open the door. Anka, help them. - Karen and I will distract them. - Why me again? Because we aren't famous for chickening out of the Olympics. Yeah. You help the kids with the door. [rock music playing] [grunts] [both grunting] [grunts] Maybe you'll have better luck with this, sister. - Dang it! - Move. Let me try something. [both grunting] Tomek, I got this. Go help the kids. Right now! [both grunting] Anka had trouble, so I thought I could help. [rock music continues] [lock clicks] There! You see that? We got it first try. Come on. [chuckles] [both grunting] [panting] [music stops] [Adiós panting] Only the treasure can help us bring them back. - What took so long? - I had to clean up your mess. Let's go! - Quickly, get in the car! - Go, go, go! The cross! - [Karen] What? - Everything goes to the museum. [chuckles] - Karen! - What? [siren blaring] - [Anka] Let's go. Come on! - They never get here till it's over. - [officer] Don't let them leave! - What? Don't move. - [Squirrel] What's going on? - [officer] Stay there. [Tomasz] All right. [grunts] - [officer] On the hood! - [Anka] Fine! - Hey! Take it easy, for... - Stay right there. - [officer] Have you got any ID? - Ow! - Don't move! Don't make this difficult! - [Mentor] Hey! Stop that! Leave that alone! Just calm down, young man. Hold still! - Settle down! Stop resisting! - [Mentor] Stop it! [bell ringing] THREE KIDNAPPED SCOUTS BLACK VOLGA SNATCHING OR HUMAN WICKEDNESS? [Tomasz] "We're a team now." "Let's make up code names. We're in this together." If you knew they ran away from camp, you wouldn't have taken them. Exactly! They did nothing but get in the way out there! - You're a married couple? - Absolutely not. Hmm. Are you sure? [chuckles] You know, for a moment there, I thought I was too hard on you in my articles. But you really are just a narcissist basking in the glow of his relics. If I stayed that way, I wouldn't have had to join a group, and the treasure would be mine by now! "Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine"! Why does everything need to be yours, huh? Why can't you get along with people? Because you wanna be close when things are going well, and then you end up lying to me anyway. [prisoner] Me too. I'm always wearing my heart on my sleeve. But people show no respect. Eagle Eye adores you. He'd have done anything for you. And the rest of the kids like you as well. And I guess I like you, too, all right? That's why you lied to me? I don't know. Maybe we were afraid of rejection? Look at how much that boy did for you. And you just keep testing him. But you forgive Karen for everything. Because her father saved my life. And I wasn't able to save his. The children have confirmed your story. Parents are on the way. Well, for two of them, at least. The third one's from an orphanage. You're both free to go. [Eagle Eye] Ms. Anka! Mr. Tomasz! Is everything sorted out? Can we go? Yeah, I'm going. I really don't care what you do. But I thought we were a team. We never were, and we never will be a team! And because of all your lies, the treasure could end up in the wrong hands. Well, we wanted to tell you, but there was so much going on, and we wanted to help. Well, you only got in the way. Mr. Car! That's actually a good name for you. You don't have any feelings! That vehicle's the only thing you love! You only care about yourself! You only wanna be alone with that stupid car of yours! Bet that's always served me well. And you better remember that, kiddo, before you start playing with the big boys. And big girls. In the end, people will always choose what's best for them, never for you. Whether it's parents, articles, or... - Treasure. - Treasure. I don't wanna go back there still a loser. I refuse! [sniffles] - They say you never give up. - Oh. You know something about that? You know why I didn't go to the Olympics? I was scared I'd let everyone down, and I wouldn't make it. I got in a funk, and I choked. Sound familiar? Excuse me. Here. So while you're there, you can feel a little safer. - I thought that you had left us too, Anka. - No. This time I'm not giving up. No one's going back to the orphanage without treasure. Let's go. Hup! [pensive music playing] What could I have missed? Oh, but where's the treasure? The cross. - The cross shows the way. - [Anka] Let's go. [engine revving] [brakes pumping] What's going on? [engine accelerating] [car horn honking] [car horn honking] [tires squealing] So, where is this treasure at, mis compañeros? [air hissing] [groans] [groaning] [straining] [motorcycle engine revving] [coughing] [groans] I'm sorry I let you down, pal. [grunting] [panting] [pensive music playing] And not only you. Too bad you can't talk. You could lift my spirits. [seat clatters] [straining, grunts] This? This is gonna cheer me up? Huh. Of course. What happened to you? And you? It's a long story. Well, ours is short. Adiós kidnapped Eagle Eye. He knows where the treasure is but needs the cross. [keys jingle] I was stupid, and Eagle Eye was right. The cross shows the way. "N" on the top of the cross means "north." The "E," "east." The other two letters didn't seem to make any sense. They're not letters. They're numbers. "L" is 50, and "X" is 10. So it's 50 degrees north, 10 east. [sighs] That's impossible. These have to be the right coordinates. And they sure are. Back in the olden days, Greenwich wasn't used as the original reference point. Point Ferro! That would be on El Hierro. Before Christopher Columbus, it was, at that time, the westernmost point of land known to Europe. So the treasure has to be here. Off we go. "We"? Well, I thought since we already have code names, we can't let them go to waste. POLICE [tense music playing] We're looking for symbols like the ones on the cross. Just be careful. [bird chirping] [Adiós] It's odd, señor Tomasz, but this boy really likes you. You don't even see it, and yet he's still loyal to you. From the beginning, I felt there was something about him, but I guess I can't compare. He said he'd do anything to help you get the treasure. I think I'll make his dream come true. How can you work with your father's murderer? [Tomasz grunts] You're the one who killed him. You think that's true? He's willing to share the treasure. You want it for yourself. For the museum. He wants the treasure to kill and destroy. You know this treasure could resurrect my dead father. Let him go. I'll find you the damn treasure. [tense music stops] "L." We're going down. [Adiós sighs] [in Spanish] Go ahead, my friends. [grunts] Quickly, quickly. [in English] Señor Tomasz, don't do anything stupid. [rain pattering] You guys can descend! [unsettling music playing] [in Spanish] Good job, my boy. [in English] See? You don't appreciate what you have, señor Tomasz. What a pity. Now you won't get the chance. - [Eagle Eye] No! - [Tomasz grunts] [Anka] Tomek! [Eagle Eye grunting] [Anka] Hey! [grunts] You said you wouldn't hurt the kids. Relax, señorita. You can resurrect them, just like your charred father. [mechanism clattering] [both gasp] [Adiós groaning] I'm coming to you, my son. I'm coming. [groans] [Adiós gasping] [in Spanish] Goodbye, my friends. [in English] Mr. Tomasz, are you okay? Hey. Please get up. I'm begging you. [Tomasz groans, grunts] - [blade rasps] - [grunts] The treasure lies where your heart is. [Anka] Let's go. This place is full of traps. We have to... No! The treasure is so close! Didn't you see what happened to Adiós? But he was acting alone, and the vault was built by a team. Look over here. Some of the plates have symbols of the order knights who discovered the treasure. Those plates must activate some mechanism. - I found the Templar cross. - [Tomasz] The Tau cross. The Egyptian cross. Everyone, stand on one of the plates. Let's try doing it together. Now. [mechanism clatters] [mechanisms clatter] The last plate must be directly under the sphere. We need one more person. [groans] [Karen] Who do I replace? - [Eagle Eye] I'll do it. - [Tomasz] No. It's too dangerous. I know, but I've got you guys. [mechanism clatters] [mechanism clatters] [tense music playing] [mechanism clattering] Is that it? [rattling] [all scream] - [Tomasz] Quickly, there! - [Squirrel screaming] [Anka screams] [Anka] Eagle Eye! Come... come on! - Incredible. - [Anka] Hey! The treasure is children. [dramatic music playing] [energy thrumming] [rocks rumbling] [Anka] Squirrel! Hold this! [tense music playing] - [Tomasz] Come on! Hurry up! - [Squirrel screams] [Karen] Run, run! Go! - [Anka] Hey! - [Tomasz] I'll get her! - [Anka] Go, go, go, go, go! - Karen! No! [Tomasz] Karen! [all panting, coughing] [Anka] Where's Karen? [Tomasz] She's back there. She didn't make it. [somber music playing] - [Tomasz pants] - [Eagle Eye coughs] What are you doing out here? I need what you found. I need the treasure. The treasure was the children who survived the crusade. Well, I see I was right to respect your intellect. What happened to them all? [Laima] There were six surviving children gifted with great power. The order knights all decided that each one of them would take a child and hide them somewhere safe. But Philip the Fair deceived them and used his child to commit unspeakable evil. And what of the scroll? They only revealed the secret hiding place of the children to their confessor, who eventually wrote it down on the scroll and hid it. He was the one that built the vault and gave the crosses to the knights. After so many years, does this scroll have any value? It can help to find the descendants of those children. Some of them have great power as well. And thanks to you all, no one will find out where they are. [emotional music playing] [scoffs] I'm sorry, but... [sighs]...I can't help you. I'm begging you. I wasn't the one who found the treasure. It was Eagle Eye. Yeah, he's the one you need to ask. What does your heart tell you, Eagle Eye? [Eagle Eye] Here. Thank you. There is great power within you. Don't ever let it fade away. I'm so glad that fate guided you the way it did. What's your part in all this, anyway? I told you already. It's personal. NATIONAL MUSEUM [Anka] Why do we love treasure so much? Because it's incredible, precious, beautiful? But maybe it's not owning it that's interesting. Maybe it's the quest or the feeling that others love treasure too. So it's important to know who we are and what the treasure is for us. [feel-good music playing] Very good article. Seems like the first one you found to your liking. Seems like the first one that's well-written. Or maybe you've changed. Kids! Hey! Holy smokes! Your article is amazing! The kids at home are saying hello to me and passing the ketchup. [Anka] Wow! Excuse me a moment. - It's so good to see you! Everything okay? - [Eagle Eye] Great! [Mentor] Yeah, we're good. So, you finally like him? It took me some time. We cleared out the rubble from the vault. We haven't found any sign of Karen. And Adiós and his people, the vault, and the Knights of Tau? They all just vanished into thin air. I asked around. Nobody knows anything. I won't rest until I solve it. For the time being, I've got something else for you. Someone in Bieszczady is stealing old priceless icons and then taking them out of the country. It sounds like the thieves have some very particular tastes. But these icons are said to contain clues leading to what's called "the mystery of mysteries." Can you handle it? - Tomek? - [chuckles softly] Alone? I don't know. I'm gonna do it with my team. And it's not "Tomek." Please, I prefer the name "Mr. Car." Madam Director? We've successfully saved the burned painting.
