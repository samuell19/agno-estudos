LOVERS Subs by: HAUTBASFRAGILE You can't smoke in here! Then pull over. Your turn. This is good. No reason to go further. Yeah, this is very good, I can't rehearse at home with everyone. Especially for this one. No no, stay down there please. I prefer it this way. When do I enter the scene? I do my monologue. Then you have two or three lines. That's it. OK? - Stop me even for the smallest mistake. - OK. "Do not kill, Madame, a prince in distress." "We must not give way here to tenderness." "Cruel enough the pain that stirs, devours, without your tears to rob me of my powers." "Recall that heart that, so frequently, found me attentive to the voice of duty." "Now the time has come. Let my love be silent." "Let *your* love be silent." "Now the time has come. Let your love be silent." "With the eye of glory, rest content, to view my duty in all its severity." "Set yourself..." "Set yourself aside now, prove a help to me; strengthen my heart." "Counter its weakness, stem the tears that, falling, prove endless." "Or if we cannot control our tears." "Then at least let thoughts of glory support us in our grief." "Let all the world now comprehend, unseen." "These tears of an emperor, and a queen." "Now, finally, my Princess, we must part." Hey, it's your turn, what are you doing? Sorry. I got distracted. "Oh, cruel! Is it now you wound my heart?" "What have you done? And yet I believed I was loved." "My soul, long pleased with your dear presence, only lived for you." "Where were your laws, when first I told you?" "What have you brought me to, what excess?" "Did you not say: Stop playing you're distracting me!" Anyway, I'll never memorize all of this. - I'm going home. Are you coming? - No, I'd rather stay here. - You're sure? - Yes. You can see your parents house from here. I noticed. 4 months in advance. I can't take your money like this. You have to go back to the agency. It'll take some time. I trust you. I'll pass by the agency tomorrow. It'll be an opportunity to meet again. You can't stay here. There's not even electricity. I love candle light. I'll see you tomorrow, OK? We'll have a matinee. - Michel... - Yeah? The keys. Hello. - How are you? - Hey. Tell me... How long does this take to cook? 20 minutes in the oven. Mom isn't here? No, she's in bed. Something wrong with her? It's because she saw Viviane outside. It gave her a shock. Viviane? She's back? Apparently. Mom says we can't see her. Come in. You okay? Yeah, it'll pass. What's wrong? Nothing. Women stuff, you know. - You won't give me a kiss? - I don't like seeing you in bed. - Was school good? - Yes. - Want to eat something? - No, It won't do any good. I'll be better tomorrow. Can I go to Ronan's tonight? Yes. But don't stay late. I recognized you immediately. Even though you've changed. This is Maryline, a childhood friend. No need for introductions, I already know your little brother. Well, I'll leave you two. See you soon, I hope. You come to the café now? No, I was looking for you everywhere. - You want something to drink? - No thanks. - I'm inviting you to my place. - Your place? You'll be my first guest. I'm so little and you're so big. I'm smaller than my little brother. What are you doing? This is my bicycle. I bought it. - Can I try it? - Sure. Will you help me? Careful! This way! What are you going to do here? I'm gonna open a fashion boutique. You don't believe me? I believe you're capable of anything. We'll see in 15 days. You wanna bet? - If you want. - Bet on what? Well, I don't have a lot to offer. I don't want an empty bet. I'll bet you for something you love. Just tell me what it is. But If you lose there will be collateral. Collateral? - Don't worry. I'll manage to get something. - I trust you. You know where I was a kid, I believe everything you told me. Even if it didn't make sense you could make me swallow anything. And now? Now I don't know. Now you're smarter. What did you do in Marseille? I worked in a nightclub. Did you do striptease? I was a magician's assistant. They called me Miss Stella. He made me disappear in a trunk. Then reappear behind a curtain. He made me walk through mirrors, Then he locked me in another trunk. Then he cut me in two with a chainsaw. He pulled doves from my bra, and tissues from my ears. And when the tricks were successful, I did this... You only have one bag? I had to pack quickly. But you know, when you're moving a lot, you leave a lot of stuff. So I don't have much left. This sweater is beautiful. Take it. You don't have much, I can't take it. I can afford plenty of stuff. - Are you sure? - Yes. You'll look great going to school with this. I'm not in school anymore, I go to high-school. It's soft. You're really handsome. I can't complain much. You've become a man. You know, the girls here don't interest me. I know them too well. What's with him? He had a night out with his sister. - You know your lines? - Almost. You wanna rehearse with me? Yeah, I'm coming. Dad. You arrived just before my break. I'm doing some shopping, we can go to the garden. Wait for me, I'm coming. I wasn't sure I'd find you the same as you were little. When it was just us two? - Did you do the cooking? - No. I went to a caterer's in Charleville. - But you can manage in the kitchen? - No. You have an apartment? I'm settling. Here? In this city? With all the unemployment? Where everything has closed? You didn't try to get somewhere else? It won't be worse than elsewhere. I wonder if that's true. But anyway, you'll have to tighten your belt. You could've cooked, instead of going to the a caterer. You're gonna have to feed your husband, one day. I have time to learn. Hmm, I don't know. When you learn easy hacks, it's easy to spend money. I'll learn. You will if you want to. You succeeded at everything, when you were little. You had gold in your hands. Everyone was happy with you. In school... Everywhere. Beautiful, intelligent... You wasted it all. You fucked up. You really fucked up. Will you stop dad? Anyway, you know we couldn't stay just us two. A man isn't made to stay alone, with a little girl. Shit, we needed a family. Yes, I know that. Now stop talking about this. You've always been really stubborn. What did you find as a job here? Wasn't it good where you were? It was. I just wanted to come back. In anyway, I don't know if you've changed. But here, things don't change quickly. Will you serve me a drink? You know, if you ever wrote to me I would've replied. Yeah, a couple of words for Christmas, so I don't forget my place. You were always on the move. I didn't think you cared. You promised me a lot of things. So I gave up. Maybe I couldn't have given you much anyway. - Hello. - Hi. - You good? - Yes. - You remember Ronan? - Yes of course! - Wanna sit down? - Yeah. You've changed! - Well, you've changed too! - Obviously. - What do you want to drink? - Orange juice for me. - What about you? - Nothing, thanks. You have to drink something! Come on! I'll have a soda. Excuse me. Sorry. It's ridiculous. Ridiculous. Wait. I adore you. - Hello Viviane! - Oh Hi! - Wait. - Hold on... hold on. Oh! This is scandalous! Ridiculous. - Hi. - How are you? - Hi Marc! - Everything good? - Maybe I can play... - Come on, you can play with me! - Uh... Do you want to join us? - Yes. - You know who he is? - No. That's the mayor, we'll see if he can arrange a job. - Really? - Yeah, it's great. You like that? -You're coming? - Because I'll have to introduce you. - Come, play one game! - No no, we don't have the time. - Coming right away. I'm gonna leave you to it, kids. Why are you leaving? - That's my friend Viviane Davreu. - Ah, very good. She had the good idea to come work here. So, this is Terry Godfroy, adjunct mayor... ...Viviane Davreu. Hello Miss. Please have a seat, drink something. A beer, Adrienne. This is my stop. Thanks! Are you coming by tonight? There's football on TV. - I'll try but I need mom's permission. - OK, Maybe see you tonight then. You dance so well, Maryline! Hey hey, stop this. Shit! Come on! You don't know how to dance you. Did I bother her? Yes you bothered her. Why did you make her scream? You don't like screaming? You want me to make you scream? Will you manage to make me scream? Come. Dance with me. - No I don't want to. - Come! Fuck! Leave me alone. Shit! I saw you dancing. You were right to come back here. We miss beautiful girls like you. With this smile and energy. I'm sure I can find you something. A little job. I don't like working. - Hey. - Hey, How are you doing? You got the bottles? Stole them from my dad. The girls aren't here? I'm here my dear, didn't you see me? Going good? (arguing) - Hey Jerry! - What? - Come help me with... - Figure it out yourself. Hey, lovebirds! You're breaking out already? My mom agreed. We can go the 17th. My brother will be waiting for us. I hope so. Anyway, Viviane promised to give me the money. - Do you have the map here? - Wait. From Dinan to Faucon. But only 3 hours to Brussels. Why are you so obsessed with Brussels. Well, you've been to Paris. I've never been to a capital. You'll be disappointed with Brussels. It's still the capital of Europe. When I get older, I'll become a eurocrat. Me too, I'll become a eurocrat. We'll all become eurocrats. Hey Marc, is your sister coming tonight? She's got better thing to do. I'd love to see her. You and I are so alike, Viviane. I don't know how. But I'm so sure. We should spend more time together. I thought you were a very busy man. You too are a very requested woman, aren't you? That's a call for bids. "Appel d'offres (a call for bids)" / Apfeldorf." That expression always makes me laugh. I've always wondered what it means. It reminds me of the name of a German village. These Bavarians who have these huge, beautiful apples. Why did you come back to Monthermé? Because I wanted to get bored. And can you afford it? What do you mean? I mean that it costs a lot to be bored. You don't work and you spend a lot. Are you speaking as a businessman? Love is also a contract, isn't it? Who mentioned love? I see that you prefer contracts. Per day? Oh excuse me, per night? You want to bankrupt me? A little bit. Fuck, stop talking bullshit, where are the girls huh? Shit. I wouldn't be here otherwise. Come on let's go all naked. Look at the strip. You've never seen anything like this! Not even on TV. Let's go boys, come on. Look at the sun goddamn it. It's so hot in here. You have no idea what you're talking about. I'm having an amazing communication with the universe. - Hey get dressed the girls are here. - I don't give a fuck. What a pain in the ass! Hello girls! Hi! You look great like this! Hey how are you? Everyone's here eh? Hi Marc! How are you? I'm happy you're here. Hi. - Did you eat? - Yeah. - You want a cigarette? - No thank you. How's theater going? Marc, come! Come on move! It's you? I can't see you right now. I'm with a guy. An entrepreneur. What happened with your party. Are you drunk? You know what this is? It's a ruby. The mayor made me wear it while he's here. We're gonna buy a motorcycle. Closer. Why aren't you saying anything. Say something! I want to die. There are things eating me from the inside. I'm pathetic. I don't understand anything. I really don't. Hey Marc! Wait for me. Stop sulking. I'm not. What's wrong? I told you. Is it that holiday thing with Ronan again? Why doesn't he want to go with you? He's going to the Massif Central with Aveline's parents. Is that his girlfriend? Are you jealous of her? I find this shitty. I think it should've been me. You think you'll remember this in 10 years. I don't give a fuck what I do in 10 years, Stop acting old! I adore you when you're angry. I find what he did shitty, They've met each other since September. We do everything together and then he dumps me for a bitch he met 5 mins ago. It's the way it goes. Love always comes before friendship. It's not a love story. It's a matter of sex, he doesn't care about this girl. That's what he tells you. And even if it's a matter of sex, it still comes before friendship. I don't see why. Because you don't know what that is. So, you wanna go to Belgium? Come on, let's go. Stop! Hello! - Where are you headed? - Beaumont. Is Beaumont on the other side of the border? - Yes. - Let's go! So, do you like this? Ouch! - You happy? - Yes. Where do we go? - Herisson! - Oh Bagimont! I prefer Bagimont! No, change of mind. I want to go... Here. - It's not this way right? - Yeah, it's this way. Oh, I adore you! - Oh, hi! - How are you?! - I'm here with Michelle, you remember her? - Yes. What? People are having fun. Maybe they recognize you. But you can sing, I mean. She's funny! - Hi. - How are you?

Is that it? Is that it? Viviane that's enough. Calm down Maryline. Oh, fuck me! Come on let's go. Nice to meet you all! Wait. Asshole! Stay there this one will stop. Come. Will you take us? Charmier Vern? That's not a common name! You sleep with a guy, and then suddenly you're doing that! I recognized you immediately. As soon as the car lights hit you. I don't want to offend you but. I blacked out and then I remember nothing for the next 10 minutes. What a night! Sure. Not the mayor's wife huh? You just want a woman. I'm sure there's condoms in you glove box. Hey what are you doing? Hey be careful! I knew it! Don't touch that! You whore! Okay, get out now! You heard me? You get out! No, wait! You can't leave us here in the woods, in the middle of the night! You're bothering me. Listen, we can't do this over some condoms, that would be stupid. You're not bad you know? Will you take us? Go away you bitch! Marc! Oh, come here. I've had it up to here. I've slept with everyone. Why did you kiss this guy? I wanted him to take us back. I didn't want us both to drag ourselves on the road like losers. We get everything with kissing. When you're a girl, you can get anything with kissing. I feel cold. Give me your hands. My feet hurt. Take off your shoes. I'm leaving. I should've never come back. I wanted to be peaceful. I wanted to have a place of my own. This valley, this forest. When I was little it always suffocated me. I always wanted to leave. Always. But I missed the country. I missed you! And dad. I missed all of this. Even the valley and the forest. I missed all of it. I don't know why. I don't understand. Everything that bothers me, everything that keeps me from living. Is also what I miss the most. Why? There's only you to take care of me. Only you. I didn't think dad would treat me this way. He asked me about you! Oh, tell me. Tell me! Talk to me... Talk to me. Tell me. He came home. I was alone in the kitchen. He asked me how you were doing. I said you were doing good. He said he was glad. Then he went into the living room. - You want to sing me your song? - No, I never sing it. Exactly. ♪ ♪ Wait! Maybe there's someone inside. There's no one. Come. (Speaking Polish) Tomek! No, thank you. Where do you come from? From all over. I'm from Poland originally. We work at the sawmill near here. - Do you know it? - No. Can I sleep in your arms? You're muscly. What are you doing? Go to sleep, Marc. Turn the light off. Come on, we'll be late! And why is that? 3 hours for you to get dressed! All of this to see a man naked. Okay, hang on. This should be the place. Did you come here before? - With Ronan. Never heard of Tournavaux? - No. Sorry. The crime of Tournavaux. A mystery nobody ever solved! Let's go, quick! Careful. - Hello. - Hi! Wait I'll be back. Alfa, Sidney and SJ. There are my friends you met last night in the van. This is Viviane, and Marc. Tomek. Tomek Soczieski. They're not dining with us? They already ate. There's only one kitchen. Let's get comfortable. Have you ever heard of the crime of Tournavaux? She was a haberdasher. She was old, almost never went out, had no family. Only one niece, who lived in Nancy. And would come to see her every 3 or 4 months with her husband. One day... Her niece arrived. She knocks on the door, Nobody answers. Even though she was notified of her visit one week in advance. They go asking around the village. Nobody noticed anything odd Marie decided to go in, from the bathroom window. They take a look inside the house. And they find a pink suitcase on the kitchen table. Intrigued, they open it. Why are you laughing? You're telling this story like you were there. It happened like that! (Translating the story to Polish) So, what was in the suitcase? A severed arm, and a leg. Oh! What horror. The police found another leg in the basement. The head, and another arm in the fridge. And in the trunk... Stop it Marc! Please. Pay attention to this next part. - It's the most important detail. - Please! What was it? A collection of really long hair. Her hair was cut too. But it was never found. What a horrible story. Why is it always women and children cut to pieces? Never the men. I'm cold. It's a little chilly, isn't it? We arrived here this winter. We thought we'd go to Paris. And work at Euro Disney. But we ran out of money. So we got hired in the sawmill. Illegally. We don't have any papers. You should get a marriage in white. A "White Marriage" is for the papers. A "marriage in white" is the opposite. Never in my life would I do that. The marriage is for papers? It's total bullshit. That's the opinion of the people. If people didn't believe that, there wouldn't be women cut to pieces. You're talking nonsense. You're like a naive schoolgirl. What's with you? More vodka. I'd go get some air if I were you. Oh yeah? Oh yeah. Thanks. My brother says he's seen your sister before. I think I saw here in Strasbourg. She bought earrings from my cousin. - Is that possible? - Yeah, that's possible. She's been to Strasbourg before? She's been everywhere. Nobody's been everywhere. We're asking if your sister was at Strasbourg. Which is something possible. And you say "She's been everywhere", that's not possible you see? Your turn to play. That doesn't interest me. I want you to kiss me. Men decide when to kiss. Nonsense. - You don't believe that? - No. I'll kiss you. In the moment when I decide to. What are you doing? I'm waiting. You saw me? No, but I knew it was gonna end that way. You're exaggerating. This is the first time I've left you. Marc! Forgive me. Will you forgive me? Tonight, yes. Give me a kiss. Your mom called, I have to warn you. She asked about you twice. And what did you say? The first time you were in the bathroom. The second time that you went out to buy cigarettes for my dad. Want me to make you a bed? Yeah. If you want. Oh shit, you smell of alcohol. Yeah, I drank some vodka. It's all there was to drink. Shit, there's no sheets. This will work. You want a pillow? Yes. Wait, wait. Let go of me! Shit! Leave me alone. Get down. Which one do you prefer? Why do you want my opinion? - Because you're a man. - I'm a man only when it suits you. Don't start, Marc. Jealousy is ugly. What's happening is important to me. I'm in love with Tomek, I swear. You said you were in love with that producer. And the Greek. And that journalist. And the restaurant owner you wanted to marry in church. I still have all the letters you sent me, if you want to see them. - This time is different. - It's the same thing! Always the same boring story! It bothers you that I'm in love. It doesn't bother you that I get deceived by disgusting men? To me things are clear, you're wasting your life. What do you know about life? Talking like you've had a dozen lives. It's not so simple. Can you zip me up? I don't want us to be angry with each other, Marc. Let's hug it out. Stay with your boyfriend. You're the only person I talk to about a guy. I'd love it if you told me about your girlfriends. It's true! You never tell me anything. I'd love it. I don't have any girlfriends. There's no girl you like? None. That surprises me. That's the way it is. I think that's good. You've always been difficult. I don't care about girls. Every boy says this. I'm different! I'm gay! Where were you? Your mom's been looking for you everywhere. What's going on? Is there a problem? So?! Where were you? With a guy. I can't be seen here. You say that I'm sick, okay? What did he say? He was with a guy? - Leave me alone you and your bullshit. - You said he was with his sister. You remember what I told you on the river boat? You and I are alike. We're too adventurous to fall in love. Can you drop me a little further from here? You're gonna leave me again? I need to see a friend of my dad's. I'm gonna buy a bicycle from him. It'll only be 5 minutes. Did you find my gift? What gift? You'll see. I just wanted to say hi. I can't stay. Viviane! It's you I love. It's you. Are you kidding me? I prefer we meet another day. We said we'll go to your place. We're going to your place. I can't let you go all alone. You'll call me in 5 minutes, changing your mind. I won't change my mind. Let me decide things for you. Everything will be fine. You don't have brains. Just a small airtight pot always ready to explode. Gathering more and more steam. Nothing else. Let go of me. Or what? Get the fuck off me! You're a piece of shit. Your report card arrived. We're proud of you, you know that? Your dad even wanted to frame it. No, you can't eat chocolate We're just about to sit and eat. Come here, you! We're gonna have a drink to celebrate. - Can I have a little? - Yes you can. Just a little sip. So, are you coming with us for the holidays? - We're going camping in Luxembourg. - I don't think so. Well, what are you gonna do? You can't stay all by yourself! It's too late in enroll you in summer camp. Well, he can do whatever he wants. Here. All that to do nothing? He does his homework at least! With a report card like this He can't go to engineering school. Maybe medical school. - We'll talk about this later. - I can see him as a doctor. You would make a good doctor. Are you coming, Marc? What's wrong? You're not feeling well? I'm not hungry. You know, your dad is so proud of you. He's more interested in Viviane. That's not true. Come on, I made some roasted rabbit. I told you, I'm not hungry. Are you crying? What's wrong? Viviane! Viviane, what's wrong? You respect me too much. (Scoffs) What does that mean? You touch me as if I was clean. It's unbearable. What would you like? That I treat you... Like... the entrepreneur? Why are you saying this? He's always been good with me. You have a funny idea of "Good". You're just like the others. I respect you too much? Or not enough? You can't understand. You can't understand, because I can't explain it. No. No more talking. - Hey, Ronan! You dumped your chick! - Shut up. It's what she wants. She's free! Subtitles by: HAUTBASFRAGILE
