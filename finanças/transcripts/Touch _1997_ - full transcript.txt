So, LL... Oh, can I call you LL? Or should l call you J, or Mr. Cool, maybe? What's your problem? What's your problem? What? -I don't have to take this (BLEEP). All right? -No, no. LL? Mr. Cool? What's LL Coo! J doing? What's Debra Lusanne doing? ...his pants. Did you see that? Elwin! Elwin! What is she doing? -Oh, my God! -That's it. Please. Please. Elwin! Elwin, please, no! Not my presidential plates! ELWIN: There goes Ford! VIRGINIA: No! -There goes Carter! -No! -Elwin, stop! -ELWIN: Reagan! VIRGINIA: Elwin! -ELWIN: Shut up! -No! ELWIN: I'll shut you up. (VIRGINIA CRYING) Hello. -!t's me. -VIRGINIA: Bill? Oh, boy! Ginny. -What did he hit you with, his fist? -Yeah. How !long has he been drinking? A!! day? A!! day. A!! day yesterday. She ca!!ed you, huh? Why did she do that? You're a beauty, you know that? That goddamn woman, I shut her mouth for a while, now ! got you starting in on me? I want to know what's wrong with you, beating up on Ginny like that. ! shut her goddamn mouth, that's what. Elwin, listen to me. What happens every time? You smash something or somebody, you end up in jail! or back at the rehab center. Is that the way you want to live? That sounds like a good idea. You want to take me? Instead of getting drunker than you are, why don't you clean up this mess? Okay. (SHATTERING) This is the Worrels', isn't it? What happened? Are you a friend of the Worrels? I know Elwin a little bit from when he was at Sacred Heart. Are you from the Center? Great, just the guy we need. -What's your name? -Juvenal!. Elwin, it's Juvenal!. -Elwin, what are you doing? -He's breaking dishes. !'!! be right back. You having fun? No, no, no. !it's a!! right. ! a!ready ate. -Is she all right? -I think so. He hit her a good one but ! don't think he busted anything. -No, I mean something else. -Yeah, she's blind. -JUVENAL: All her life? -Since I've known her. Here, put this on her face. You know, Ginny's mother gave us these dishes when we got married. Christ. Twenty-one years ago, ! hated these goddamn dishes. They got rosebuds on them, like a little girl's tea set, you know. All that time, you know, you get through your mashed potatoes and you wipe your gravy, and there's those goddamn rosebuds looking at you. VIRGINIA: Elwin! Elwin! I'll tell her I got rid of them goddamn rosebud dishes. I finally got the nerve to get rid of them. Jesus, I cut her, didn't I? No, you didn't. I'm sure you didn't. Ginny, what are you doing with that broom? Ginny? You all right? I can see. I can see you both as plain as day. Hi. -Is Juvenal around? -Juvenal? No, Juvie's off today. -Are you in the program? -No, but a friend of mine is, Elwin Worrel. I met Juvenal at Elwin's. Do you want to talk to Father Donahue? Sure. Elwin's problem, he knows he's an alcoholic. He just hasn't hit bottom hard enough to feel it. Well, he's hitting other people pretty good and he's doing a job on his house too. Do you know Virginia, Father? Yeah, she's been here. I understand she used to play organ at your church. That was years ago. You're an ordained minister, right? (SIGHS) Well, nowadays I sell recreational vehicles, but yeah, I had a church. Uni-Faith. It's more of an outdoor setup. You know, amphitheater for 1,500 people. Had a chapel, a gift shop, kind of like Stuckey's, but what got the crowds, we had the world's tallest illuminated cross, 117 feet, "Jesus Saves" across the top in blue neon. At night you could see it all the way from the interstate. Around here? Georgia, outside a place called Dalton, but then I moved the show out here and went bankrupt. Well, that's fascinating. Ginny was our organist. You know that? You must know also that she recovered her sight. I understand you were there. Yeah, and a fellow from the Center here, name of Juvenal. See, Ginny believes he performed a miracle on her. A miracle? I don't know. Maybe it was just a jolt to the head. I don't know. See, her face was clean before this happened. Then when I looked at her after, there was blood on it, up here. Maybe it was from her nose. She wasn't bleeding from her nose. I don't know. It's not my area. So, you want to talk about Elwin, right? He's part of it. This Juvenal is the other part. I wondered if he spoke with you about Virginia. We're going to have to make it another time. I've got volleyball scheduled. I'm late as it is. -Maybe I can talk with Juvenal. -Sure. -They said he's not here today. -Come back anytime. Hey, you got any clothes you don't want, bring them along. You are a pretty snappy dresser. Everybody is so serious and uptight, you know, like somebody in the next room is having a baby or dying or something. I mean, you know, Jesus, all they're doing is representing a rock-and-roll band. I keep thinking, what am I doing here? BILL: Making money. You know what my view is? The parking lot out back of the building I live in. How much you pay here, 8? $950. And all the hotshots they come in, they take over. I'm the one who sets up the hospitality suite. I mean, I do all the shit work. I go to get the Heinekens, you know, the vodka and mix, Scotch, a nice cheese tray, lay it all out. -Which one is this? Which group? -Flaming Dogs. -Bunch of shitheads. -Never heard of them. You have to be just into puberty. They wear, oh, you'd love this, actually. They wear these sort of skintight, snakeskin-style jumpsuits cut down to their pubic hair. You know what I mean? Showing off their skinny white bodies. I mean white. These two brothers, Toby and Abbot, and four other creepy guys I think they got from an institution. You're not happy, you should quit. -I know. Well, I did. -Come on. Well, not in so many words, but... You know who's a happy girl? Virginia Worrel. I know. She called me. Did she? I didn't know you were that close. Well, you know, I think she called everyone she knows. Getting your sight restored, that's heavy. Yeah. Did she tell you about this guy, Juvenal? She was asking me about makeup. Like I'm some kind of an expert or something, you know? What'd she say about him? I told her that she should try some mascara, you know, and tried to tell her how to apply it without saying her eyes. Like if I said "your eyes," she'd go blind again. It was really weird. What'd she say about Juvenal? Said he was cute and clean-cut looking, which would be a switch. Want to meet him? I don't know? Why? I tried to see him four times. It's like they're trying to hide him. So I figured, "What the heck? "I bet you Virginia spoke to him." So I called her. Sure enough, she went to see him, they had quite a talk. See, Virginia believes he healed her. Well, why not? It's better than thinking it's your husband beating on you. She tell you he spent time in a monastery? I don't think so. He was a monk. He was a Franciscan monk for seven years, some place down the Amazon. He came back after four years, then he quit the order. Why would he quit the order? I don't know. I mean, maybe something about it irritated him. Like Audrey Hepburn in The Nun's Story. I'm thinking along those lines. I'm thinking he's down in Brazil healing people and the head Franciscan gets jealous. People coming from all over to get cured. Pretty soon they're setting up stands, they're selling Juvie relics. Religious items. See what I'm saying? Well, yeah, I ought to. I worked for you long enough. All right, maybe, just maybe, this Juvenal is the genuine article. -What would you think about that? -You know, gee, I don't know, Bill. What if he is? Are you curious or not? You want to get out of the RV business, wasting your talents selling motor homes. You understand, I can't do a study on him. The priest there at the Center knows about Uni-Faith. So he's suspicious. Also there's the "anonymous" part of Alcoholics Anonymous to deal with. These people wouldn't give you his last name. I'm wondering, how would you like to join them for a few days? Me? Do you know how many of these I drink? I mean, maybe two a week. You can fake it. Act hung over, you know. Like, shake a little bit. What do you mean? Pretend like I have some kind of an ailment? Like what? We'll think of something. Well, so how do I get in, pretend I'm an alcoholic? Usually there's a waiting time unless the person comes in in really bad shape. How long? Have a drink. Finish the bottle. What the heck, we'll get you another. Although I think it might be quicker if you switch to vodka. What, do you mean tonight? You want me to go in there smashed? "File number 7753047. "California penal code 240, 241, 242. Assault and battery." You people back there, take a seat. Father Navaroli, would you tell us what happened, please? Well, it was at the 10:00 Mass, right after the offertory. We were singing the Sanctus. The what? You were singing "Holy, holy, holy." FEMALE PROSECUTOR: Mr. Murray. I'm asking him a question as a right of counsel. Mr. Murray, if you are representing yourself, you may cross-examine, sir, when it is your turn. Proceed. Exactly what did he say? He said, "This is not the holy sacrifice of the Mass. This is a clown show." He goes "This is a clown show. It's a mockery." Then he pulled my stole. He pulled it from me, then pushed me, knocking me down. He tripped on his microphone cord. -Mr. Murray, you've been told, sir. -Your Honor? JUDGE: Wait till we're finished. I think it's open to question whether you are qualified to sit in judgment of this particular matter, considering the fact you were excommunicated by your church, Your Honor, following the recent circumstances of your divorce and remarriage. I have been patient with you. This is a misdemeanor court hearing on an assault and battery charge. You will not open your mouth again. Is that clear? Let the record show, that you are now speaking to me in a subjective and emotional fit of anger. You are in contempt and you are remanded to the custody of the bailiff. I want a jury trial. It's my right and you know it. -ALL: OUTRAGE! OUTRAGE! OUTRAGE! -What are you going to do? Shoot them? -Go ahead, shoot them. -OUTRAGE, OUTRAGE, OUTRAGE! JUVENAL: Hey, guys. MAN 1: Hey! MAN 2: Hey. How are you doing? Softball team good? Yeah, it's good. -Hey, buddy. -Hey. -Hi. -Hi. Can I join you? -Sure. -Yeah? -You're Lynn, aren't you? -Yeah, how'd you know? I'm Juvenal. I'm on the staff here. You came in early this morning. You look great, you know? How do you feel? (MUMBLES) Not too bad. A little, you know, fuzzy. Hey, Juvie, we got a staff meeting in 10 minutes. -Okay, I'll be there. -All right. Well, your eyes are clear. You have pretty eyes. Well, thank... Wow. All the compliments, I'm not used to it. Well, you don't look like you've been drinking. I mean, too heavily. Well, I thought it wasn't the amount that you went by. No, you're right, it's not, but, you know, after a while, it shows. So, what are you doing here? Are you hiding? -From what? -I don't know. I'm just asking. -Oh, I thought that you were being funny. -No, I'm curious. What are you doing here? Well, isn't this a place to dry out? Yeah. You're not an alcoholic. -I'm not? -No. That's funny, the doctor and the nurse, you know, they didn't seem to question it. Come on, tell me. -Tell you what? -You are hiding. From what? You've got it turned around. You're the one that's hiding and I came to find you. Father Donahue. Hi. I want you to meet Father Nestor. He's Franciscan. -How do you do? -Hello. He's the pastor out of St. lsidore and I told him about the Center. So he took up a special collection last Sunday after mass. -Well, we certainly appreciate it, Father. -$82. I also told him you'd take a couple of minutes of your time to tell him about your work around here. Meanwhile I'm going to run upstairs and say hi to Juvie. -He's out. -No, he's not. I called. He knows I'm coming. LYNN: Yeah, that's Bill Hill. Virginia and I both used to work for him. And he put you up to it? Why? -Hey, there you are. -Hey, August. Hi. This is Lynn. Have a seat. -You want a cup of coffee? -No, I don't drink coffee. So, what'd you do now? -Here's that article with a picture. -Oh, that's nice. August is head of a group called OUTRAGE and they demonstrate a lot. This is about him getting arrested. What was it, disturbing the peace? Assault. You hit this Father Navaroli? No, I didn't hit him. I just tried to hand him some pamphlets. OUTRAGE is the name of your group? Organization Unifying Traditional Rites As God Expects. They go around breaking up guitar masses. We're trying to restore traditional forms of worship. Are you a Catholic? No, no. I used to be married to a sort of a one, but he never went to church. August likes Latin. He doesn't like the Mass in English. How is the Gray Army of the Holy Spirit, August? It's Gray Army of the Holy Ghost. And we're doing great. We've got over a hundred members now. Most of whom will be out at St. lsidore Sunday. Did you get your invitation? Yeah, I did. You know, I don't think I can make it, though. I told Father Nestor you'd be there. Well, I know, but things come up around here. Sunday's a bad day. How do you dedicate six years of your life to God, and then just throw it all away? I didn't throw it away. I was into that, and now I'm into something else. Helping drunks? What should I be doing, August? I don't have to tell you that. I'm gonna get back to work, but why don't you two stay and talk? No, no. Father Nestor's waiting on me. I'm gonna tell him you're gonna be there. Listen, I'm gonna pick you up. Now I'll see you Sunday. Bye, it was nice meeting you! Well, why don't tell me about Juvenal, when you guys used to live in Brazil? You know, the Juvenal story. What do you think about that as a title? Either that or Miracle Worker? Oh, boy. I think I have to go to the bathroom again. Why didn't you go when we were back there? I did. I have to go again. Once the urge comes, there's nothing I can do about it. Now, Father, I'm talking about Juvenal. Now you were in ltapiranga quite a while before he got down there, right? (SHUSHING) It's pronounced "ltapiranga." Oh, yes, yes, I was there for many, many years. So, and you helped him along, you showed him the ropes. No, I was in São Pio Décimo. And he was... Most of the time, he was at Convento de Nossa Senhora Nazaré. (GROANS) You knew him, though, right? The doctor says a parasite in my intestine causes the dysentery. I could have it for years. No, no! I want you to tell me about the first time you met Juvenal. And when the miracles started and the first time you saw blood. Oh, my... Hope we're almost there. (GROANING) I used to hide them in the garage. Different places. The shrubs even. Which is why I was always cutting the grass. In my apartment, when I clean up about once a month, I'd reach under the couch and I'd just drag out all these bottles. You ever reach under there and you come out with one you had forgotten about? You know, you put it on the table next to about a half a fifth you got left. Set for the day. That was a good feeling. They usually don't talk that much about drinking or D T’s, unless a new resident's asking questions or there's somebody they want to impress. Like me. So, this is your office? Yeah, I use this one if I have duty. I can hear better if anyone freaks out. My room's down the hall. -Well, I won't bother you. -No, sit down. You want to ask me something, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Aren't you a little irritated? You know, I mean, I tell you that I've come here to find out about you and you're not mad or anything. Well, I haven't told you anything either. You and your friend Bill Hill... But that reminds me. You were a baton twirler in a religious service? Well, it wasn't exactly during the service. You know, I whirled a little while the... While the choir was singing, me and another girl. I mean, the part of the service that was the real feature is Reverend Bobby Forsha'd come out and he'd heal people. What, do you want me to ask you how he did it? No. it was fake. I mean, at least I think most of it was, anyway. I don't know. I mean, maybe Bobby healed some of them. -Do you think that's possible? -Why not? Do you heal people? I guess so. How do you do it? (JUVENAL SIGHS) I don't know. I mean, it's not something I can explain. Wow, this is weird, you know it? I mean, you're actually telling me, like if I had something wrong with me, a disease or something, that you could cure it? Is there something you're worried about? Well... I'm not sure. I guess maybe I'm worried. Yeah, but I don't know if I should be. You were going to tell me you have a lump, maybe a tumor. And if it's malignant, would I do something? Was that to test me or to shock me? I don't know, maybe both. Well, if you're worried, take my word, your breasts are okay. Well, this is a new one I'll have to figure out. Don't try so hard. I'll be back. Arnold's having a bad time. BILL..Bill's Motor Homes and Siding. Thank you for calling. I'm getting out of here tonight. Pick me up. -Lynn, what's wrong? -Nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong. It's just that I want to get out of here. You spoke to him?Already? Yes, I talked to him and he's real. He knows things. Listen, I've done my job and now I want to leave. What happened?Did he do something? Did he heal somebody? Listen, I got to get off the phone. Okay, just pick me up in 40 minutes, okay? And get me a bottle of spumante. Juvenal? Juvenal? Oh, my God. You mean there were nails in his hands. No, like wounds like from nails, you know, and a cut on his side. it was... -What did he say? -Nothing, he just looked at me. Was he in pain? No, I don't think so. He seemed like he was sad. He was just quiet. He didn't say anything? No. No, well, you know, yes, he said my name. And I remember hearing it now as I ran out. Maybe he wanted you to help him. Help him? Help him what, put Band-Aids on? He had the same wounds Jesus had. -Do you think he wanted me to help him? -Somebody at the Center must know. I can't imagine a priest not knowing. What, you mean, like if he had scars? He'd have to. If a wound keeps opening there's got to be a scar. (PHONE RINGING) But if it's a miracle, why does there have to be anything natural about it? Who said that? Did I say miracle? You did. Yeah, that's right. You see people walking around every day with crucifixion wounds. Yeah, what? I really don't have time for this. Just say it. Fine, that's... Yes. Yeah, right. Bye, see you. That was Artie. He's taking the early flight. I got to pick him up at the airport. -I thought you quit. -I did. I just have to give him my records. Wait a minute. You've been talking about going to St. lsidore tomorrow, seeing Juvenal, see what's going on with this weird Gray Ghost guy. You witnessed something. Few living people have seen a miracle. Now you tell me these rock-and-roll records you have to give to Artie are more important? Business records. Not records records. They're called CD’s now, you know, by the way. Look, it's at 1:00, right? 1:00, St. lsidore. I have a road map. I'll meet you there. What's this Artie like? What have you got in mind? Well, you hear a lot about a guy, you like to meet him face to face. He's a music promoter. You know, everything he says ends in "but." He says, blah, blah, blah, "but," you know. What are you looking at me like that for? I'm concerned about you. -You feel all right? -I feel fine. You're afraid to meet him, aren't you? Juvenal? No, I'm not. I'm not afraid. I'm just a little nervous, that's all. There's something about you that's different. What do you expect? I just got out of an alcohol treatment center. Well, just help me with presentation, Lynn. Yeah. Okay. No, I'm not going to help you with presentation, Artie. I have a vacation. Remember I'm on vacation? I have one coming. I'm going to hang up before I catch that new kind of AIDS, hearing AIDS, the kind you get from listening to assholes. A vacation, but... No. I'm not going to discuss business, okay? You do that. You're going to church? Somebody's getting married or did I miss something? I don't want to be late. A prompt man is a lonely man. Did you just make that up or were you saving it? -I was saving it. -Oh, God. (CONGREGATION SINGING HYMN IN LATIN) Hi. Thanks. Blessed be God. Blessed be his holy name. ALL: Blessed be his holy name. Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true man. Blessed be his most sacred heart. -ALL: Blessed be his most sacred heart. -Bathroom. Please be seated. Let's get some air. As we continue our consecration, let us ask the Holy Ghost to bless this special day. We beseech thee, God, three in one, Father, Son and Holy... Over there. -What's going on? -I don't know. AUGUST: Have a seat. There you go. There you go. "Suffer the little children." That's right. Come on up here. Thank you. Thank you, Sister. Okay. Father Nestor will be right back, but while we have a moment, I'd like to introduce you to a remarkable young man who's dedicated a good portion of his life serving in the jungles of Brazil on the Amazon. Juvenal? I... I began my work... Richie! (GASPS) ANTOINETTE: Look! Stop it! What's going on? Hey! Hey! WOMAN: Oh, my God. ANTOINETTE: Richie, come back here. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Juvenal. Distribute the pamphlets! Distribute the pamphlets, man! Come on! Pass out the pamphlets! Distribute the pamphlets! Come on, everybody. KATHY: This does not look like blood. It's blood. You saw it on him and you saw it on the kid. Yeah, I saw it, but to the readers in the paper, it's going to look like a dark blob. Then you tell them it's blood. You tell them, "This is what blood looks like. "Suddenly his hands began to bleed, "blood flowed out as if nails had been driven through his palms. "His side began to bleed, as if by a spear." -I never saw his side bleed. -It bled. He is good-looking. Who is that girl who pulled him out, a sister? Okay, you got three stories here. You got your stigmata story, miraculous marks of Christ appear for the first time in 10 years on a humble man, one-time missionary named Juvenal. -What kind of name is Juvenal? -It's his Franciscan name. -What's his real name? -He'll tell you if he wants you to know. -Do you know what it is? -Yes. -Are you going to tell me? -It's his name. He can tell you. Okay. Fine. if I see him, I'll ask him. Second, you've got your OUTRAGE story, the rapid growth of the traditionalist movement. A counter-revolution. The return to time-honored ecclesiastical and sacramental rites. What else? The miraculous healing of little Richie Baker. Who's little Richie Baker? A 10-year-old victim of acute lymphocytic leukemia, a terminal illness he's had for two years until 10:25 this morning. This bald-headed child? Every week he goes down to Children's Hospital to get a cobalt treatment. Now check it out. -How'd you know he's cured? -Check it out. Actually, it's not my real name. My real name is Charlie Lawson. -Charlie? Come on. -There was a St. Charles. -Yeah. What did he do? -I don't know. Probably got martyred. (CHUCKLES) Well. How on earth did you get Juvenal? Well, when you go into the order, you pick three names. I liked Raphael or Anthony. They showed me a list. Said, "Pick something else." So I said, "Oh. I guess Juvenal." Do you think it's all right? I mean, stigmata blood going in the wash? No, it's my blood. I don't see anything unusual. Well, this is weird. I mean after everything that happened, you know, all those people and what they must be thinking and we just sit here, all this blood pours out of you, you don't even get excited. I was numb. -Really? -Yeah. What was it like the first time? It was a little boy that was crippled. -This was in Brazil? -Yeah. He came in the street and I don't know why, but l... l touched him. I was scared. And I knew in that moment that something was gonna happen and I wanted to run. I felt something wet and thought the boy was bleeding. Then I looked down and saw my hands. Can I see your hands? Yeah. Wow. You always have those? No, they go away. So, what do you think? You think this is God doing this to you or... I don't know. I mean, it could be psycho-physiological. You know, like when we're sad, we cry. We get mad, there's a physical reaction. You know, if my mind's causing it, then it's psychosomatic. If God's doing it, then it's supernatural. What did the other Franciscans say? -My superiors? -Yeah. Well, they said to keep quiet about it. You know, they don't want another Lourdes or Fatima. You know, the carnival atmosphere. You must wonder a lot, why you, huh? Yeah, once in a while. I used to all the time. -Can l... Can I ask you a question? -Sure. Never mind. I've been asking too many as it is. I can wait. I got to get back pretty soon anyway. So, are you going to come finish your cure? No, I dried out. But I can take you. You were going to ask me something. I bet it had to do with, do I go out with girls? Or do I like girls? Or am I sort of strange or celibate for religious reasons? Something like that? Wow, is that part of it? I mean, you know what people are thinking? No. You know how to do it? You listen to people instead of thinking what you're going to say next. That's all. You learn things. Like the other day in your office. No, I just had a feeling you were going to test me. I said your breasts are okay. I could've sworn you were going to say something, only you didn't. Yeah, I was going to say something like, you know, "Just okay?" And give you a look, you know, but I mean, kidding. Why didn't you? I didn't want to sound like a smart ass. Well, it wouldn't have been smart ass, it would've been funny. So why'd you touch me? Why not? We were talking about your breasts. There's the Worrels'. -Elwin straightened right up. -Yeah, I know. Ginny told me. -She watches him. -She loves him. Okay, I'll ask. So, you got a hang-up about girls, or what? No. No, I like girls. -You were married, what, five years? -Four. Four and a half, actually. Well, you know something I don't. I bleed from five wounds and heal people, but I've never been in love. Look. I'm the one brought you into this. I want to know what's going on. You spent the whole day at your place doing what? You took a shower. What you mean, like, did I seduce him or something? What did you talk about? We talked about all kind of things. I don't know. He's a very normal person. Yeah, it's very normal. A person's hands start dripping blood. Well, not just his hands, remember? -You know, I washed his clothes. -Why? You washed his clothes? Why didn't you save them? What's he supposed to wear, something of mine? I don't think you understand what you got here. You want lunch? Let's order something. What you got here is like a light. You cannot keep it under a bushel. -You're going to exploit him. -Not exploit, expose. Get the word out. -Such as? -Well, I'm thinking about TV. I got a nice in at KQRD. I sold them some honey wagons. You think that they're gonna pay you money to put Juvenal on TV? I don't know. Or you hadn't thought it out quite that far, though, yet, had you? It's... Not that kind of TV. Well, if you think I'm going to help you put him into some sort of a religious freak show, you're full of shit, Bill. Who said... Did I say freaks? I hate that word. Did I say something about freaks? Hey, Bill, you know what? Stuff your lunch. You know, I don't work for you. I don't have to take that tone of voice, either. Lynn. AUGUST.Agapitus, a youth of 15 years, was brought before the Governor of Palestrina, condemned for being a Christian, flogged, placed in a foul dungeon, had hot coals put on his head, boiling water poured over him, his jaw broken, yet to every inquiry he responded... I am a Christian. AUGUST.He was taken to the stadium in the presence of all Rome, Ied before the wild beasts. The lions, ravenous with hunger, approached Agapitus, yet they would not harm him. Agapitus said... Let the breaking of bones and tearing of limbs, let the grinding of the whole body come upon me, be it so, only may I win Jesus Christ. AUGUST. When the lions refused to eat him, the Governor, seeing this, had a seizure and died on the spot. Agapitus was finally beheaded. But not before the example of his resolution had converted the tribune Anastasius. You are really into this, aren't you? -Do you know the story of St. Agatha? -No. Upon resisting the advances of Quintanian, the governor of Sicily, she had her flesh tore with iron hooks, her breasts cut off, and she was thrown onto fiery coals whereupon a giant violent earthquake shook the town of Catania. That's quite a story. Did they rape her after carrying her flesh away? I don't think so. What I'm trying to say, Augie... -You mind if I call you Augie? -It's okay. I'm trying to say, we don't have to be on opposite sides of this Juvenal thing. You have an interest in him. I respect that. He listens to you. We're on the same side here. What side is that? Being men of the cloth, so to speak. We want the same thing. Get the word out. See, that's what surprised me most about this article. Your name being not even mentioned, after bringing it all about. I know. They didn't use any of the pictures I gave them. Worst of all, there's not even one mention of Richie Baker after all that kid's been through. If they ever mention me at all, it's usually in a derogatory way. Do you have the prints of these pictures you took? -Yes, sir. -Good pictures. -You have your own darkroom here? -Mmm-hmm. Back. -Just excellent. May I keep these? -That's what they're for. And this. Miracle Worker ofthe Amazon. You did this? You researched this? -Yes. -That's good. I could help you. I could proofread these. It's all a matter of tone. -You know? -Right. Remission? Remission, your ass. I can tell by looking at him. I'm his mother. F-U-z, fuzz. I am rubbing fuzz. See. I told you. I told you they wouldn't believe you. I am not raising false hopes. There's nothing false about them! Get me the Daily Press. I know what you're going through. -Maybe I can help you. -You know why I said I'd talk to you? Because you're a friend of Lynn's. I wondered how close you two were. -I'm protective, like an uncle. -Well, I just wondered. She said to me, "if God has given him this gift, why would he keep it secret?" I tried to explain it to her. I told her you work here because it's an ideal place to remain anonymous. If that's what you want. -Why can't I stay the way I am? -Because the news people won't let you. They've caught a glimpse of you. They're not going to let you go till they've picked you apart. I think you'd want to step out into the world more. See what you've been missing for seven years. Get a taste of life. Father Donahue suggested he and I go down and talk to them, issue some kind of statement. You're going to have to do something like that just to be nice. But I'm thinking, what if you were in a position to tell your own story, personally, to everybody, take as much time as you want. What, on television? That's part of it. Publishing also. People like something they can hold in their hands. Put beside their bed, reread when they're feeling down, you know? Get the true meaning of a book, yes? Get your story out. What is my story? Touching people. You touch people, they change. I don't mean just the sick and the infirm. Don't you know that? Take Lynn for instance. She's changed. What do I have to do? AUGUST: Look at her. She's a little old, but not too bad. (GRUNTS ANGRILY) Damn! Look what she made me do. -Who? -That runt! That reporter! The other one. You know, there's not a word in there about OUTRAGE and I gave her the entire story. Not a word about the Gray Army. I thought Juvenal might have said something. If he's supposed to be so tuned in, or whatever you call it, sympathetic. It's not his fault. I can't even get near him. It's that alcoholic priest down there. He literally pushed me away. He said, "Juvenal's got stuff to do." And I said, "You're damn right he's got stuff to do, "for the Church, not for a bunch of stinking drunks!" You want this? There was a robbery at Save Rite. They caught the guys. There's robberies around here all the time. Look, they get their pictures in the paper with their stupid hats on. Bunch of punk, no-good kids smiling. And you know why they're smiling? 'Cause they know they're gonna be out in a couple of days, walking around going, "Hey! What are we gonna break into next?" Well, I'll tell you what. I hope they come around here. That's my dad's Smith & Wesson .38 Commando. I hope they try to get in that door right there. You wouldn't actually shoot anybody, would you? Hey, if he was coming in here to take something of mine, you're damn right. I'd shoot to kill. Now if God wants to have mercy on their souls, that's up to him, but I'd shoot to kill. BILL: I understand how busy Miss Lusanne must be and I appreciate you, darling, taking the time, but it's important that I speak to her in person. A lot has happened since I first called, and you couldn't see me, huh? What have you got? Okay, he raised his hands, like the crucified Christ and blood poured from his palms onto the altar. And all over the kid it looks like. Poor little boy, he was going to die of cancer until Juvenal touched him. -Who says? -The kid says. The mom says. I talked to his mom. In fact, I represent her also. Beautiful woman, name of Antoinette. His mom. What does she do? Would you believe it? Richie's mom is a topless dancer. Wait right here. I'll be right back. -Hi! -Hey. -Well, you found it okay. -Sure. I was here before. Oh, yeah. I was surprised when you called. I had to get out of there. The reporters and TV, newspaper people were taking over the coffee shop. That's not the reason I came, though. I know. I came 'cause I wanted to see you. In fact, you want to know the truth? Yeah. I was dying to see you. I was dying, too. I couldn't get to you fast enough. Let's go inside, okay? Wait. We'll do a sidebar doc segment first. Bring on Richie and his mom, a theologian, maybe a psychiatrist, and then I'll go one-on-one with Juvenal. Yeah. This is a gentle person. I think he deserves the full time slot. Maybe we should go outside the studio. Your studio is good. It's homey, it's comfortable-feeling, it's, you know, not too controversial. Controversy is my oxygen. It's the air I breathe. People schedule their day around my show. Now where is he? Well, you get the time slot. I'll deliver Juvenal, and why don't you leave the psychiatrist out of it? Just talk to Juvenal. Why don't we leave you out of it instead? I got it! Why don't you talk to the kid, his go-go mom, the doctor, theologian, the psychiatrist, one week, huh? Set it up. Next week, have Juvie on for the full half-hour. What do I talk to him about for a full half-hour? Whatever you want. Then, when there's 10 minutes to go, you know what happens. Tell me. In front of 50 million people, if your network's any good, it'll do its promotional work, Juvie gets the stigmata, he bleeds from his five wounds, heals a cripple of your choice live on national television. (SCOFFS) The competition is fierce. Here's the chance to see your ratings shoot up from fifth to first. What if he doesn't produce? (SIGHS) What if you had Julio lglesias on and he couldn't sing? Look if you'd rather see him on another network, just let me know right now. LYNN: You know what? I love you. -I love you. I love you. -JUVENAL: Mmm. LYNN: Either way, any way you say it, I knew it, but I wasn't prepared to say it, but I love you so much, I can't believe it. Like it can't be happening. No, it is happening. I'm pretty sure it is. Yeah, it's happening. I can feel it. We're lucky. Right now we are. You sound very solemn. Yeah, I got to watch that. You know, the most important thing you can do in life is to not take it too seriously. I wrote that down. Why? Because it's true. Errol Flynn said it in this movie, Escape Me Never, with lda Lupino. It was on TV. Look, all I'm trying to say is that being serious doesn't mean you have to be solemn. But, yeah, you're not just someone, some guy. Sure I am. I'm Charlie Lawson. Nobody's called me that in a long time. You wanna? You can call me Charlie. You're in a religious order. I left. Priests leave all the time, get married, it doesn't seem to bother anyone. God, I'm lying here with you, with the same as Christ's wounds. Do you realize? (GIGGLES) Try to put yourself in my place. Would you like to look at it from over here? JUVENAL: I like your outfit. (LYNN LAUGHS) JUVENAL: Can I ask you a question? LYNN: What have you got on? Nothing? JUVENAL: Is this how people talk? LYNN: You know, I don't know if there's a book on it. -Can I ask you one? -Sure. Have you met Antoinette Baker yet? The mother? Yeah. She and Richard came by. Everybody calls him Richie but he doesn't like it. I called him Richard and saw his face light up. That's not what you were going to ask me, though. You're scary, you know that? Have I ever made love before to anyone? Why couldn't you ask me that? You don't have to tell me. No. Her name was Annie. We spent the night together in a motel. Did you like her? Yeah, yeah, I liked her. We met in a bar downtown. She was a prostitute. Oh. I didn't know it at the time. She was nice-looking and funny. And you spent the night with her? I was drunk. Well, I don't mean that as an excuse. I was very curious about the girl. About going to bed with her and all, finding out what it was like. About being drunk, during that period after I walked out of the order and left St. Augustine, I was drunk most of the time for three weeks. I can't imagine you drunk. That's why I went to Sacred Heart. Father Donahue straightened me out in about three days. I've never been jealous before. It's a new feeling. You know, having something you want so much that you're afraid it's going to end, something's going to happen. Like what? Like I don't know, something. BILL: Okay. KATHY: What is this? It's a list of titles published on angels and, hello? Saints. The last two years alone, 35 titles. We're talking a cottage industry here. Second only to serial killers. Don't get me started. And it's all yours. You get exclusive access. Juvenal as told to Kathy Worthington. Aren't you sweet? What do you get? -Ninety percent of everything. -That's outrageous. That's America. We're talking 4 or 500 thou. Mmm-mmm. Seventy-five percent, it's a deal. Your paper has a publishing output deal, yes? Yes, but I'd have to talk to him first. Well, that's no problem. Big problem. Every reporter in the city wants to talk to him. Yeah. How about I tell you where he is? I'm one giant ear hole. Yeah, but you know, don't listen to anything he tells you. Why not? He's a con artist. (BOTH LAUGH) He's your friend. Yeah, but he's still a con artist. You'll end up with nothing. Hasn't offered me anything. See? What do you think, he's getting you into this for free? He sold them a package and he's making all the money. You know, I know this because he asked me to be his partner. Tell him you'll do it. What? I don't understand you at all. He's using you. No, he's not using me if I let him. I'm agreeing to it. But you don't hide out for years and then suddenly decide to go on national television. You're worried about people taking advantage of me. How can they if I don't make any claims? But you don't know people. You rock their boat, their beliefs, and they come after you. (DOORBELL RINGS) That's probably him now. Wait, don't, don't, don't answer it! (CHUCKLES) Hi! You're Lynn. I'm Kathy Worthington. How are you? Caught your act Sunday. Not bad. So, here you are. Have you two known each other long? -We sort of grew up together. -You did, really. Where? Right here. Are you serious? (LYNN LAUGHS) Yeah, isn't he cute? I could just eat him alive. So, you two living together? We're dating. Yeah, and how's that going? You're serious? -Boy, are we. -We're getting married. We are? -Isn't that what you do? -Well, I haven't even thought about it yet. Forgive me, but don't you think it'd be kind of odd being married to a stigmatic or a stigmatic... Help me out here, I don't know which one. -JUVENAL: Either one. -Okay. Oh, a bit strange. What, are you kidding? He's a really neat guy. Oh, he's neat. That's great for you. I just hate to think of what's going to happen to him when he gets on television. Oh, are you gonna do a talk show? Yeah, Debra Lusanne. Debra Lusanne. Mmm. Do you know what you going to get yourself into there? JUVENAL: Is it like Oprah? You've not seen it? Well, the good thing about it is that Debra's never seen Juvie, so they're even. Okay. I think you're being just a little bit naive here and actually I wanted to get into this topic. Why are you allowing yourself to be so used and exploited? LYNN.. Well, heisn'tifheknows it. And he knows what's going on. Richie! Look, it's Uncle Juvenal. Well, look at it this way. You get not only an instrument of divine providence, but one that's in love and living with a popular, young record promoter. No! God, what are you doing to me? -What? -Greg, come here! (GRUNTS ANGRILY) Is this legal? -Come on! -Okay. Get your camera ready. (EXCLAIMING) (SCREAMING) -Are you okay? -Damn chair! Be careful. (GROANING) (GREG GROANING) The path to salvation... -You, too, can be saved. -Support Sacred Heart. -Did you smell that guy? -Support now or suffer later. Yeah, that was in ltapiranga. Sure. I-T-A-P... Yeah, I'll have to talk to you later, Kathy. How'd you get in here? They keep you pretty well hid, don't they? You got something to hide? Oh, that's right, I forgot, you do. Where's the... Down the hall, to your right. "A wicked and adulterous generation will seeketh a sign, "but no sign will be given unto them." Sound familiar? Yeah, Jesus was speaking about the Pharisees and Sadducees, August. My point exactly. Bill Hill and his friend, that woman. Let me ask you this, do they make a condom that protects the soul? Well, I thought you and Bill were working together. Is that what he told you? Is that how he used you? Look at this. They make a nice little couple, don't they? They tell you about their operation down in Georgia, Uni-Faith? Yeah, Lynn told me. Well, maybe you should think about that. They told me you'd snuck in here. Get out! -You get out! -Get out! I've called security. -What about Nestor? -I know where to find him. What do you mean he's not there? WOMAN..He left. Something about August Murray. You know, the guy in the uniform. Father Donahue was really upset and Juvenal said it was best he leave. BILL: She didn't tell you? ARTIE: Bill Hill. Did you try to call my office? BILL: I'm trying to find Lynn. ARTIE: Well, Lynn, she's on vacation. She mentioned you. You, too. That's what I'm wondering. I'm trying to find her. You know how to keep a dog from humping your leg? -She doesn't answer her phone. -Pick up the dog and suck its dick. Artie, now that I got you here. I represent Juvenal, I think you know that. -He sings too? -Even better. You know Gregorian chants? Big seller two years back. It's like rap music, it is. It's religious rap music. It's guys in hoods mumbling to slow music. -Keep talking. -No overhead. zero. You get some obscure recording. -Recycle something from the archives. -Mmm-hmm. Tell them it's from Brazil, put Juvie's face on the cover, huh? Boom. (CELL PHONE RINGING) You know how many units the Pope sold? -Two point five. -Exactly. But he toured. I got to take this. Yeah. I'm there now. You been drinking again? "Why?" Because you're not complaining, that's why. Call. Call my office. -All right? -Artie. There's somebody you should meet. I'll call you. Yeah. Okay. (SINGING)So, we say you We can't find you (CAR APPROACHING) I die in my tears I die in my tears I die... (KNOCK ON DOOR) Hi, Ginny. Can I come in? I know he's here. Now why would he be here? Where else would he be? -Come on in. -Thanks. Nice outfit. You going out? That's the way she dresses all the time now. Elwin, would you please get a beverage for our guest? What would you like? VIRGINIA: Is that the picture? LYNN: Yeah. You found me. Lynn, l... No, that dress, that's the dress that I bought to go to St. lsidore, and that's the outfit that Bill was wearing. -Lynn... -Good Lord, Juv. Is this the picture you were talking about? August Murray did this. Even a blind person can see it's a fake. Honey, didn't they have photos down where you were? I mean, what'd they do, draw in the dirt? Juv, I was worried sick looking all over for you. It wouldn't have mattered if it was true. Well, it wasn't. There's something you should know. What you two need to do is to get away from here and all these people, and I know just the place. Let's go away some place. Yeah. (HOW DO YOU DO PLAYING) These things I've learned without you Should have never been done Call on me and l'll shout down How do you do when I'm not around? How do you do when I'm not around? How do you do when I'm not around? So, have you decided definitely? Yeah, I'm gonna do it. You're sure? Well, that's part of what I was trying to tell you. I told them I'd be on the program. I've committed. Well, what's the other part? It's all over. What is? The healing. The stigmata. How do you know? You know what I did? When? When I was shopping? No, this is before we left. JUVENAL..After August gave me that photo. After what he said, when I was confused, I went to a mall. You know the indoor ones, where they sell jeans and candles, stuff like that. I walked in and saw this palsied man sitting there and I went up to him and l touched him. Nothing happened. Sol went to the bathroom. I'd bought a little, what you call them, a penknife, like for cleaning your fingernails. When I came back out, he was still sitting there and l touched him again. I didn't feel anything, but that wasn't unusual. I didn't feel anything the other times either. AUGUST. "The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, "and tempting desired him that he should show them a sign from heaven. "He answered and said unto them, "A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, "and there shall be no sign given unto it. " I was ashamed. Of me? No, me. I was afraid. You know, I tested Him. God. That's when I knew it's over. That's why I'm going to go on the show. That's what I'm going to say on TV. It's over. But what happens after? You know? What do we do after the show? Anything you want. We don't have to live in LA, do we? No. We could move to Detroit if you want. Yuck. -Denver? -No. -Topeka? -Des Moines? Yeah. (CHUCKLES) LYNN: I have a good feeling. Oh, a feeling spilling over. Not just us, but over everything. Spilling over everyone I've ever known. My parents, Artie, the Flaming Dogs. They're not so bad. Bill Hill. Oh, definitely, definitely. Poor Richie. Everybody's calling him Fuzz-head now. (CELL PHONE RINGING) The other kids. I told him, don't pay any attention to the little shitbirds. Poor little guy. Yeah? Hey, I'm talking here! We're having a conversation here. You want to make a phone call, go to the john. See that, I told you you'd like her. I've seen you before. You sure have. Your label has an account with the club. You come in with those rockers and their girls. What are they called? Assistants. Assistants. I was wondering, does that pay good? 6 bills to start. But you can work your way up to maybe eight or nine. BILL: Augie, sit down. Augie, Antoinette. -Hello, August. -Artie, Augie. That's some mean-looking bruise you got there. Yeah, I bumped it. So, any luck? Well, I went down to the Center and they tried to keep me out of there. So I went to the TV station to find what's-her-name. I tell you what. I'm going to get some answers pretty quick or I'm going to break somebody's arms or worse. Don't do that. There's a lot of local talent around, in case you're interested. I was really surprised to read about Juvenal and his girlfriend. That kind of surprised the hell out of me, I mean, a holy person. You don't, you know, think of them making out or even being interested in girls. He was very nice and Richie likes him a lot. I guess he would. He just didn't strike me as being that way, you know. Even though you read about priests all the time now running off with nuns, which is fine. I mean I'm not going to judge or condemn anybody, providing they're not hurting other people. What's her name? Lynn? Lynn Marie Faulkner. A sweet girl. Used to work for me. Artie could vouch for her. Oh, very sweet, very nice girl. She doesn't sleep with the DJs. She's got that shiksa thing going, like you. WAITRESS: What can I get you? -BILL: Same thing. -And you? Ginger ale. I think it's real cute. A man like that should, you know, get out more often. Find out what life's all about. I'm a Catholic. Went to Catholic schools and all. You mean, you were Catholic. Maybe when you were little. No, I still am. I was baptized one. -Do you go to Mass on Sunday? -Sometimes. You dance naked in a beer garden and you call yourself a Catholic? Beer garden? I believe they're called gentlemen's clubs. (ARTIE AND ANTOINETTE LAUGHING) You say you're a friend of hers, but she hasn't talked to you. Where is she? ARTIE: Lynn's on vacation. She's not home. Maybe she went somewhere with Juvenal. I don't know. I think that's nice. Go off by themselves. -I was going to say, being a Catholic... -You're not a Catholic! Being a Catholic, I've always thought that priests... Well, that people would listen to priests more if they had a little experience, instead of talking about sex and marriage and things and not knowing a goddamn thing about it. (BILL LAUGHS) You don't have to jump in the mud to know that it gets you dirty, lady. -Can I ask you a personal question? -What? -How come you're not married? -How come you're not married? I had a lovely wife, Barbara Rose, and her memory is all I can handle. Really, how come you're not? Because I don't have time for anything like that. I knew you were going to say that about jumping in the mud. Women, I imagine, though, are attracted to you. -ANTOINETTE: Oh, please. -I'm serious. Don't you get a certain number of women attracted to your cause? We don't allow women in OUTRAGE. That's the whole goddamn trouble with the Catholic Church. All that boy-girl shit, keeping them separated, so they won't have impure thoughts and get aroused. You ever get aroused, August? Come by the club sometime. We'll check you out. (ALL LAUGHING) Yeah, we'll check you out. I got it, Augie, put your money away. Hey, was it, is it something we said? ANTOINETTE: (LAUGHING) "Is it something we said?" There's something I got to do. BILL: Is that right? Whereabouts? Can we watch? -You'll read about it. -We can't watch? You'll read about it and you'll remember that we all sat right here, while you and this one here were making your clever remarks, trying to put me on. And remember one thing, I warned you. About what? You'll read about it and remember, there's nothing you can do. -Little shit bird. -Augie, come on. Augie. -Ever play Carnival? -No, what's that? I sit on your face, you try to guess my weight. Sounds interesting. BILL: Augie. -She's hot, huh? -Yeah, hot as a doorknob in hell. How could you do that to Juvenal, a holy instrument of God? I didn't do anything. Well, you introduced them, so Lynn could ambush him and assault his purity, drag him down to her depths. What was it you said you're going to do, "Get the word out"? Out of what, his pants? I understand. You're worked up, you're upset. What are you up... What are you talking about doing? You sir, are an offense. An odor in the nostrils of God. Let me say this. It's something I learned at AA. It's a shortened version of the Serenity Prayer. Kiss my custom-fitted ass. (BOTH CHATTERING) Oh, my God. Oh, your friend, August. I mean, can you believe this? I mean, this is like a band on tour or something. (SCOFFS) Man, am I glad I'm not going back to that. You know, they get a bug up their ass about some little nothing, and then they're just going to trash the room. What would he have against Patsy Cline? Stigmata is an act of God. A stamp of approval on the movement to restore traditional rites as God expects. What are you doing here? You've been contaminated. As you rid the cripple of his disease, I will rid you of yours. (GROANING) Well, the lettuce is no good. I'm not even going to touch it. JUVENAL: The mustard's fine. You want mustard? Sure. What's that? Are you kidding? -Stigmata is an act of God... -August, August... Stay where you are! Oh, my God. -What do you have in mind? -To get her out of the way once and for all. No. You have a mistaken idea of what's going on here. Out of the way? Out of whose way? His. How am I in his way? He can do anything he wants. We haven't done anything wrong or else I'd realize it, wouldn't I? You've examined your own conscience? I don't see how, as long as you live in an occasion of sin. We're talking about my conscience, aren't we? Not hers. She doesn't have a conscience. Look, let's keep it simple. Let me assure you my conscience is in good shape. What, wait. Why don't you think I have a conscience? Because you're hollow. Without a spark of spiritual life. -I didn't fake a photograph. -The camera doesn't lie. August, let's sit down and talk about this, all right? After we can talk all you want. -Give me the gun, August. -Stay out of this! -Give me that gun! -LYNN: Give him the fucking gun! JUVENAL: Just put the... (SCREAMING) I think I killed him. "Ask and you'll get what you want," isn't that what the Bible says? Well, we went and asked. (CELL PHONE RINGING) I'm Catholic. People can say what they want, they can write what they want. All I know is that my... -Hey, listen here. -Yeah? Not now. ...just giving him hope, and now he's better. Lew Wells has prepared a background segment on the Juvenal phenomenon. LEW.. Brother Juvenal, formerly Charles Lawson, served six years as a Franciscan in ltapiranga, Brazil, where the first of the miracles occurred. And again more recently at a church consecration arranged by August Murray, self-styled leader of the Gray Army of the Holy Ghost, whose goal is to restore traditional rites to the liturgy. And with us is the young man everybody's talking about, Juvenal. -Hello. -Hi. Your name is Charles Lawson, but you're referred to as Juvenal. Which would you prefer? Juvenal is fine. They couldn't get him a better suit? It's from the Center. It's the clothes room, you know. I tried to get him to get a new one. But... ...mystical stigmata. What is it? It just happens. Idon't do it. I don't say it's mystical either. What do you mean by that? Look at him. Isn't he neat? DEBRA.. Do you believe in God? JUVENAL.. Yes. -Do you believe in miracles? -Yes. You believe God, if he chooses, can perform miracles through you? If he wants to, yeah. Would you say you're impressionable, suggestible and perhaps a little naive? I probably am. What... What do you do, do you close your eyes, pray and say, "Come on, God, give it to me"? No, I don't do any of that. Why would God choose you to give you this gift? I don't know why God does what he does, but I came on this show... Are you aware that Cardinal Ryan, the Archbishop of your very own church, has refused to acknowledge your stigmata? -Yes. -Your miracles. Perhaps in light of a well-publicized relationship with a young lady, Lynn Faulkner, a music promoter. Wait. You asked me if I believe in God. I said yes. You didn't ask me if I believe in the Church. Now sometimes I don't like God much, or what they call God, once they get him under their roof. Wow. Well, your, your manager told me to expect some surprises and I guess we just heard one. Well, of course you do know Bill Hill? -Yes. He's not my manager, though. -Oh. Well, that's the impression I got. In fact, he told me to make a special point of mentioning your forthcoming book, which my researchers tell me will guarantee you $600,000. What?I'm being paid for the book? DEBRA.. Well, didn't you sign a contract? Yeah, I signed something. Idon'tknow what it was, though. Did you sign it in blood? -You son of a bitch! -It's okay. Kathy's writing it. -It's a collaborative kind of thing. -Juvenal gave me an interview. -Yeah, but that was for the paper. -He called me. Take it easy, okay? How many times did I try to talk to you? You refused to hear anything about it, right? But you made a book deal. BILL: It's not as much as she's saying it is. How much? She's using this to make Juvie look dumb. -How much? -400. 350. How do I know? Juvenal signed the contract. But you didn't tell him about the money, did you? I mean, you didn't tell him he's going to make $600,000. The amount isn't definite until we know the size of the first printing. When we get the check we were going to surprise him. We? You're part of this, of course. I don't want to be in it. Have we had a chance to talk? You go away who-knows-where without saying a word. You don't tell me where you're going. You tell me to stuff my lunch. How much are you getting out of it, I mean, since it is his money? I had to do everything. I had to set it up. Sell Debra. I had to make the deal. How much? About half. That sound fair? Write it down. -Half? -LYNN: Half. Half. (BUZZING) -This is the one you bit. -Here. So... God. DEBRA.. You say you believe in God. You say you don't believe in the Church. The Church believes in God. Who's right? It's not about being right. The Pharisees, they wanted to be right and they were up to a point. It's about being. Being kind, being patient, being loving, forgiving, not judging. Drawing out the best in the other. Seeing the presence of Christ in everything and everyone. You know, you mentioned forgiving. That brings up an interesting point, because with us today we have a friend of yours, or should I say, a former friend, Mr. August Murray. Now, it seems that what happened was that you in protecting your friend from Mr. Murray, you threw Mr. Murray off a second-story balcony, breaking both his arms, his legs, his ribs, his collar bone, his... Juvenal, what I have to ask you is, how can a man who has the power to heal also have the power to harm? That's it. We're getting out of here. Bitch. Go over there. -You okay? -I'm fine. DEBRA: Oh, Lynn! Well, gosh. Well, hello. Sit down. We were just talking about you. (STUTTERING) I have nothing to say to you. What, are you hiding something or are you ashamed? She ruined you and everything that we've worked for. Get her off. Get rid of her. Tell them to send a microphone over here. I don't blame you. It's not your fault. It's hers! August, I'm sorry that this happened, but you're still full of shit. -DEBRA: Has Juvenal changed your life? -Well... He seems pretty special. (AUGUST GROANING) What the hell is going on? DEBRA: Jesus. (GROANING) I never... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. (GASPS) What a miracle. Over there. Move the cameras over there. Come on. -DEBRA: August Murray. -Hi. -Oh, you wild thing. -Wow. -Sit down. -I have always wanted to be on your show. Well, this is obviously your lucky day. -How do you feel? -This is so great. I feel great. Yeah? Do you feel touched? (INAUDIBLE) DEBRA.. We'vehada lot of reaction to last week's show, to say the least. Let me read you some of the letters. A New Jersey resident writes, "That was some show. "The body cast was a good touch. "How did they do that? What was it, open in the back?" A woman in California had this to comment. "To disguise promiscuous sex as love "was even more offensive than your so-called miracle. " And this from Florida, "What can God be thinking?" (TOUCH PLAYING) Touch, Iight as a feather I will wait for you honestly I am yours entirely I remember last night's dream Could it be the one of me? I have known the face inside the window And the voice forever in my heart Like an angel's arrow I remember last night's dream Could it be the one of me? I've been waiting silently Will you risk it all With me? -Touch, light as a feather -I have known The face inside the window -I will wait for you honestly -And the voice forever in my heart -I am yours entirely -Like an angel's arrow I remember last night's dream Could it be the one of me? I've been waiting silently Will you risk it all With me?
