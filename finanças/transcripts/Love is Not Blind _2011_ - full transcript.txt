From a scientific point of view, at the moment of a breakup, because of panic, mistrust, rage, depression, and various negative emotions, every grown-up may become a lower organism that can't think independently. And due to different blood types, zodiac signs, and education levels, breakup scenes can be very different too. Sometimes, you need to make the first move. Let's break up. We're not right for each other. What are you talking about? I said, let's break up. Don't you understand? Say it again. Sometimes, you can keep it civil. I feel that we have problems. I feel the same. How about we separate for a while? You are the brave one. I've been wanting to say that for a long time. I knew you were too polite to say it. I should get going. I'm taking the subway, you? I'll take a taxi, want a ride? Take care. Sometimes, a breakup can turn into a crime scene. The girl holding the perfume bottle is Feng Jia-qi. We've been close friends since junior high. The man who's holding her hand is my boyfriend of seven years, Lu Ran, my future husband, who said "I love you" to me just this morning. Why are they together? That's why my breakup scene was filled with perfume. The top note is potpourri, the middle note is grass, the low note is sandalwood. I will never forget that smell. Hello? Where is the client's wedding gown? Where are you? Are you quitting? I'm warning you, you are dispensable. You can't disappear like this. Come back immediately. Bastard! You are all bastards! POST-BREAKUP, DAY 1 Don't just stand there, speak. How long have you waited to say that? I'm a bastard? You are the bastard! Not me! Are you sick? What is it? Am I wrong? No. Mr. Wang, can I sit down first? I have a stiff neck. You deserve it. What the hell happened to you yesterday? Why did you scream at me like that? I got dumped, Mr. Wang. I see. You got dumped? You deserve it! To be honest, I felt better after Mr. Wang scolded me. In our wedding planning company, everyone knows that if Mr. Wang is willing to scold you, it means your life still has value. Mr. Wang is a legend in the company. Everybody loves him. In my opinion, my other colleagues are kind of weird. The Cantonese guy who sits in front of me is always secretly having a smoke under the desk when he is at work. When I first saw Ke Xiao, the designer who sits behind me, he already reminded me of the perverts in stories. Let me treat you to a lollipop. I almost forgot, he also has dyslexia. So he has to read everything out loud to understand. Username. Password. Pussycat Cici's actual working hours are from midnight to 5:30 a.m. She is a real party animal. She is dedicated to her work, and has never been late once. Goodie, you burned your lunch again. Goodie, the receptionist who is a 36C, proves a truth about women, one cannot have big breasts and a big brain at the same time. Since I came to this company two years ago, she has burned her lunch every day. The whole office always smells like her plastic lunchbox. This smell also reminds us we have accomplished nothing since we got up, but we made it past the morning anyway. Huang Xiao-xian, are you okay? I'm okay, what's up? If you are okay, don't hit the board. When you hit it, my desk moves and spills my coffee. Other than Mr. Wang, my partner Wang Xiao-jian is also a legend in the company. Because of his good looks, when he first started working here, everyone including the cleaning lady were charmed by him. But I know, his sexual orientation isn't clear. He is mean, fussy, and sinister. I am no match for him. We have worked in the same group for two years and have argued more than an old married couple does. I'm easily angered, and he is good at emotional abuse. He drives me insane with his passive-aggressive behavior. I fall for it every time. Hello? Hey. Are you at work? Let's cut the act, okay? Okay. I wanted to call you to explain things. But I never found the courage. I didn't know what to say. Lu Ran, you are saying the exact same thing that you did when you were trying to date me. Okay, since you are scared, just answer my question. When did it start? Well... Half a year ago? Yes, but at that time, I couldn't find a chance to tell you. Bullshit, the three of us are together every day. We were discussing where to travel just a couple of days ago. Who do you think I am? A spectator of your affair? And now the show is over, isn't it? Xiao-xian, you scare me when you are like this. Can you let me finish first? Stop being snarky. I am snarky? Who was the one who told me "I love your cynicism"? But now, I'm tired, Xiao-xian. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to cry and beg you? "Lu Ran, come back. Don't leave me." In your dreams. I don't have the gene for begging. Xiao-xian. I'm not calling for forgiveness. Do you understand? We're not right for each other. If you like, you can yell at me. You can say whatever you want... Hello? Xiao-xian? Forget me. I can't. It's too difficult for me. Because you've never been on my mind. CAN WE MEET AT THE CAFE TOMORROW? FENG JIA-QI Hi, long time no see. What's the occasion that brings you both here? Let me know if you need anything. Xiao-xian, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. That's easy for you to say. Let's put it this way. If the broken glass forgives me, I would forgive you. Okay, let me think. On our graduation day, we were both drunk. I cried right here. I held your hand and said, "Luckily, we are together." You cried too. You said we'd always be together. Were your tears genuine? I couldn't find a job and stayed at home. I split a pack of instant noodles into three meals. I even ate the chili peppers in the spicy meat slices as a meal. I was too embarrassed to ask Lu Ran or my family for money. So I came to your place every day. And you said you could support me for a lifetime. Was your sympathy for real? Once, you quarreled with someone in a bar. I immediately flipped the table and fought for you like a crazy woman. Lu Ran tried to stop me, but I yelled at him too. Were you really scared for me at that time? Or did you enjoy watching me do that? You amaze me. Really, Feng Jia-qi. You should act in a movie. We had great times together, didn't we? Stop it. Don't force me to look back at good memories. It's disgusting. BELOVED FENG JIA-QI, LU RAN DELETE ALL? DELETED Huang Xiao-xian, if I were a woman like you, I would be hiding in the bathroom. Miss Li. Good afternoon, Mr. Wei. Sorry for making you come all this way. It's fine. We should cater to every client's needs. Are we meeting here because you want to host the wedding here? No, Mr. Wang, Miss Huang. Don't you know? The afternoon tea here is very good. Whenever I have time in the afternoon, I always treat myself here. Miss Li, are you from Taiwan? Li Ke's Mandarin is great. No one can tell she's from Henan. Right. Miss Huang, isn't my engagement ring beautiful? It's beautiful. It must be really expensive. It's from Tiffany. Wei wanted to buy a Cartier ring at first, and I reprimanded him for that. Cartier is for parvenus. It is not sophisticated enough for me. Miss Li, according to your sophistication, what kind of video clips should we start preparing for the wedding? First of all, I can't eat shellfish. I can't even look at it. I'm very allergic. Even if I see it, I'll break out in hives all over. Also, I want a wedding cake from Kashai. Remember, I want the one with mild cream. Also, I want the whole wedding venue to be decorated with purple and pink roses. Remember... I've attended many weddings since I entered this business. Some weddings are luxurious, some are warm, some are eccentric. When I imagined my wedding with Lu Ran, I always felt that nothing was important. As long as he was there. Are married... Of course, none of this is wrong. But you're a girl, you must understand. It can't be too simple, right? There should be some suspense. I don't quite understand. What do you mean by "suspense"? Do you want us to hire several beautiful girls to crash your wedding as mistresses? Sorry, she was kidding. Don't take it seriously. I need to go to the restroom. Please continue. I don't want the wedding march as the opening piece. It's so clich√©. I want my entrance to be unique as well. It has to be totally unexpected with a bam! Then I suddenly appear and surprise everyone. And it has to be dream-like. You need to take this down. Also, before my entrance, I want... That's my... Miss Huang? What are you doing here? You are awake. I should go home then. Hey. Did you bring me back? Isn't that obvious? Li Ke didn't have time to deal with you so I was the only one who could take you home. Thank you, Wang Xiao-jian. Wait, no, I mean... Wang Yi-yang. Get something to eat. You were so heavy even with an empty stomach. What's wrong with you? Why can't you say anything nice? Hello, Mr. Wang. I want to ask for a day off. You want to take a day off? You caused me so much trouble, and you want to take a day off? Do not test my patience. Mr. Wang, I'm in a terrible mood. I passed out while meeting clients yesterday. Come out, have lunch with me. If you don't, I'll consider you skipping one day of work. - Welcome. - Welcome. I want to pretend I don't know you. No need, thank you. Try this wine. It has a chocolate taste. Taste it carefully. Well... I did, it tastes like money. The wine is perfect with beef. Mr. Wang, let me get things straight first. You're treating me to such an expensive restaurant. Do you want to fire me? Is this my last meal with you? Why does your generation, no matter what sex you are, have persecution mania? Then I'm even more scared. If you're not firing me, are you trying to date me? I'm trying to date you? What's wrong with you? I already have a daughter. Why would I try to date you? Okay, I am relieved. All this luxury was making me uncomfortable. You haven't eaten well or slept well lately, right? All because you were dumped. It's nothing. Why is it bothering you? A feeble mind and a fragile heart, that's you. The boys nowadays can't resist sexual temptation. Look, you're a wreck. Aren't you ashamed? What are you talking about? Who's a wreck? I have every right to be sad and to question my life. You haven't even given birth, how can you question life? Mr. Wang, you have a daughter. If she were dumped, and she ran home looking for you, would you also scold her like this and say that she was a coward? I'm already trying my best. I don't have a chance to scold my daughter. When she was born, I thought to myself, I had to give her the best start in life, or she would be at a disadvantage when she grows up. So I worked so hard that I seldom went home. I hope that one day, when she grows up and she runs crying to me when she gets dumped, I could take her out to shop for the prettiest clothes, dine at the best restaurant, and give her whatever she wants. What's the big deal about breaking up? Fine food and expensive wine will always be there. In the end, I did earn money, but her mom divorced me when she was eight, and they moved abroad. I've only seen her twice in five years. Once, when I called her and said, "Little princess, it's too early to date in junior high school." Guess what she said to me? Take one sip of wine, and one bite of meat. The cello behind me belongs to my daughter. Now, it's yours. Sign up for a class, divert your attention. Go home and take a shower. A good girl at your age shouldn't be so messy. As the old saying goes, time heals everything, even if I can't tell you how much time it will take. Actually, he doesn't know just how much I wish someone could tell me how long it would take to get over the breakup. POST-BREAKUP, DAY 5 Li Ke and Wei Yi-ran finally embrace each other. The sky and the earth come together. The wind and the clouds move. Thick clouds disperse, and a meteor shower falls. It's amazing, right? Yes, it's a big production. But the main point is, how are we going to film it? Money can't buy a meteor shower, right? You are unprofessional. Even I know that it can be done in post-production. This is a waste of money. It's not worth it. Money isn't a problem. I only marry once. So we should spend the money. Isn't that right, Wei? Please excuse me, I have to go. Since you're here, why don't you stay for a little longer? You need to have a membership to get in here. Order anything you want, put it on my tab. Can you drop me off so I can do some shopping? I don't want to take a taxi in this hot weather. It smells bad. Okay, I'm going too. Still cold? My heart is warm. Waiter. Yes, what can I get for you? Give me a glass of wine, the same as what the lady who sat there ordered earlier. Right away. Huang Xiao-xian, I need to confirm something with you. Who is this? I am... Are you drunk? I'm not drunk. You are drunk, all of you are drunk. You have never been sober. You are so drunk that you don't even have morals anymore, and can't tell the truth from lies. Where are you? Still at the club? Where am I? Where could I be? I haven't moved. I'm not moving, I'm staying here. I'm not the one who fucking left first! Excuse me, miss. Do you need me to contact someone to take you home? - Take me home? - Yes. Let me see who can take me home. Lu Ran. Can you come take me home? You came. Look, the Imperial Palace. Let's go to the Imperial Palace. Please say something. Let's go, I'll take you home. I didn't want to trouble you. I know, you're not that type of person. What do you mean? You're not the type of person who is easy on others. I don't understand. Huang Xiao-xian, do you really not understand? Things between us didn't turn bad overnight. Think about it. We were together for so long. Every time we argued, you always hurt me. Although you never used dirty words, what you said made me want to hit my head against the wall and kill myself. You'd feel better after arguing. But have you ever considered my feelings? I would beg you every time like a dog, trying to give you an out. You would always stand there arrogantly, not moving an inch. You always stood above me, and I had to stand below you, looking up at you. I've looked up long enough. I can't stand it anymore. I looked up so much, my neck almost snapped. Have you ever considered that you're not the only one with self-respect? I've considered it. Either I look up at you my whole life, or I take my self-respect and start a new life. You can never change. No one can handle that huge ego of yours. But I'm not the same. I want to move on. Do you understand? I can go home by myself, you should go now. Then I'm leaving. Okay. I suddenly understood what he meant. I have to stop the taxi. I have to tell him that I know I made a mistake. Can you forgive me? Can you wait for me? Wait for me please, there are so many obstacles in life. There are so many people in this world but only you can make me feel safe. Please don't give up on me. Please don't give up on me. I don't want my fragile pride. I only faked my self-confidence. I want to show you how humble I am now. Can you forgive me? Please forgive me. Let me go! I'm not going to make it! Let me go! Are you awake now? Thanks. Someone once said, the dirtiest thing in the world is pride. I suddenly realized that even if it is dirty, I still have to live with my pride for the rest of my life. What happened? Last night, Wei suddenly told me he thought making the video would be too troublesome. What should I do? I have to make the video. Miss Li, it's five in the morning. You called us here just for this? I also planned to get my beauty sleep after clubbing. But I couldn't fall asleep without knowing how to deal with this. You have to help me. I definitely have to make this video. If you can't do it, I'll hire another company. Wait. Let me think about it. We... Whatever. Excuse me? I said whatever. What's with your attitude? Miss Li, if you and Mr. Wei don't agree, have a fight about it at home first, and let us know what your decision is afterwards. We don't help clients solve their disagreements. Besides, we have no obligation to do so. To wake us up at 5:00 a.m. for this, I'll attribute it to an emotional lapse. When I step out of the door, I will forget everything that was said. Yes, we're earning your money. But this doesn't mean we're on 24-hour standby. We have our working hours. Let's go, Huang Xiao-xian. We need to have our beauty sleep as well. Miss Li, one thing before I leave, I've been in this business for years. I've seen all kinds of circumstances, including couples breaking up before the wedding because the guys are pissed off by the girls' stupid requests. The girls would be filled with regret, and they'd beg the guys desperately. That isn't a dream-like result at all. It's only for your information. I meant nothing else. Let's go, Huang Xiao-xian. If Mr. Wang finds out about this, he'll kill you. But I have to say, I sincerely feel that you are a highly-skilled jerk. Let's go for breakfast. Where do you want to go? A shop nearby sells tasty fermented soy milk. No. Why would I want a smelly drink in the morning? We can have lamb soup. No. Why would I want lamb intestines in the morning? Let's go. So, have you sobered up? I am not only sober, I have my memory back as well. Why did you slap me earlier? Why do you ask so many questions? What a great location. How did you find it? Did you send your secretary to find it? I rented a place in the village when I first came to Beijing. It had three rooms and a courtyard and cost only 200 yuan a month. But it was so far away from my office that I had to get up at four in the morning. On special occasions, films were shown in the village. I would buy a beer and sit here watching all night. That was a great feeling. That's why I want to have my wedding here. Come, I have a surprise to show you. Why aren't you drinking? So lame. - Yes, it's so lame. - I really can't drink anymore. - One more drink, okay? - I had one already. Wang Xiao-jian persuaded me to go out with my co-workers for the first time. I'm not being dramatic. Not long ago, as soon as I left the office, I would pretend I didn't know them. Now, I regret it a little. My life shouldn't have been all about Lu Ran. I can also have lovely friends like them. Goodie is a super cautious girl at work. But she is a totally different person after a few drinks. Bottoms up for me. How about you? Are you going to drink it or not? - Come on, drink! - Come on! Bottoms up. - Come on! - Bottoms up! You really can't drink. You really can't drink. Come on. Ke Xiao is good at teasing the waitress. Salmon sushi. Okay. Sashimi sushi, scallop sushi, dorado sushi. Sir, do you want all of these? No. I just have to read it out loud. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cici loves to talk about true love after a few drinks. If he loves me, I can give up the clubbing life at any minute. I'm not talking about you, look at your dirty hands. The Cantonese guy is actually a yo-yo master. Use your strength when you throw the yo-yo out. Keep it steady when you pull it back. Sometimes the string breaks and the ball drops. - Amazing! - That's it. Master. What was that move called? Don't break it. It's late. Is your boyfriend waiting for you at home? I wish, it's a client. Then mute it. What's there to worry about? Move over. How terrible is your client? She reminds me of my sister when she was in menopause. And the administrative officer at my school. She looks lovely when she's not talking, but the minute she talks, it's all nonsense. For most people, a wedding is like a press conference. But she wants it to be a red carpet show. She has so many stupid requests in every meeting. All that nonsense is not meant for humans. What a pain in the butt. You two are too good-tempered. I would have put my mascara brush into her cornea. Huang Xiao-xian! Girl, can't you tell mute from hands-free? You? Forget an umbrella? Usually, you're the one who even has baby powder in your bag. I need to make myself look more miserable so Mr. Wang won't fire me. So childish. He might forgive you if you chopped your hands and feet off. Ground floor. Door opening. Mr. Wang. I made a mistake. I know I was wrong. What was your school motto? Pardon? Tell me your school motto. I don't remember it. How about you, Wang Yi-yang? "Respect teachers and moral values. Pass the torch to the next generation." Okay, Wang Yi-yang, you can leave. Okay. Your generation doesn't value relationships. You went to the school for four years, yet you can't remember the motto. If one day my company fails, you'll probably leave without any emotion. I expect you to make money, you expect me to pay you. At least we have a partnership based on cooperation. I'll call the client to apologize. What do you want? Miss Li. I want to apologize for what happened yesterday. Wow. You sound so sincere today, unlike yesterday. Miss Li. My behavior was completely inappropriate, and it hurt you. I'm sorry. I don't expect you to forgive me, but please stay objective. I hope you can continue to work with our company. Maybe we'll never be friends but our company can give you the wedding of a lifetime. Please. There are loads of wedding planners. As long as I find the perfect husband, I will have a perfect wedding. As a woman, I have to say that I pity you. Right, I have a gift for you. It's a pillow. You can hold it when you sleep. When you receive it, you'll understand. That's it, bye. I'm all right. Go back to work. What's your revenge plan? Revenge? I don't want to seek revenge. Let's crash her wedding. Forget about it. This kind of girl only marries once. If I mess with her wedding, she may destroy my life. It's not worth it. Miss Li. I'm Miss Lin. Lin Zhu. Are you expecting a call? No. Why are you calling me? Are you in Beijing? Yes, I am. I'm calling to tell you I'm getting married. What? It's a lightning wedding. Come with Lu Ran. Lin Zhu, you didn't know that we broke up? Lu Ran said he would bring his partner. That's... Yes, don't worry about it. We had a peaceful breakup and we both have new partners. I'll be there the day after tomorrow. Can you do me a favor? I've been waiting to hear that. I've already come up with something. I have a friend who has a special interest in collecting people's boogers. I can ask him for some, and you can send it to Li Ke. Tell her those are natural raisins from Xinjiang, grown in full sun, and are good for the skin. Stop. This "friend" is actually you, right? I'm not talking about that. I need you to attend a wedding with me. No way. Please, I'm begging you. I have to go there with a guy. My ex-boyfriend will be bringing his new girlfriend there. You can bring your alter ego. I'll buy you breakfast for a month. I'm not going. You can watch me drink fermented soy milk for a month. Totally not worth it. Wang Xiao-jian, let me tell you. If I feel bad from the wedding, you'll be miserable in the following month. If Zhang the doorman still worked here, I would definitely not beg you. And this better not give you a big head. You can't afford me. I'll give you 200 Yuan. Keep the change. You really cannot afford me. You are dyeing your hair? Why don't you dye your skin? What to wear? Huang Xiao-xian, let me tell you. He won't pay attention to you no matter what you wear. Even if you are drunk and strip down to nothing but black garters and stockings, he won't be the one to cover you with a coat, do you understand? Don't call me again even if you don't understand. Wang Xiao-jian is right. Yes. The meeting tomorrow is not a date. No matter how beautiful I look, I'll only be the past to him. WANG XIAO-JIAN I'M AFRAID I WAS TOO HARSH BEFORE PERHAPS DRIVING YOU TO COMMIT SUICIDE THEY SAY, WHEN YOU MEET YOUR ENEMY, THE BRAVER ONE WINS SO TOMORROW GIVE IT ALL YOU'VE GOT TREAT THE WEDDING AS YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND'S FUNERAL I'LL BE THERE TO ESCORT YOU ON YOUR MISSION I'LL BE THERE TO ESCORT YOU ON YOUR MISSION ZHUNG SI TAXI - Welcome. - Don't smile. Hello. THREE HOURS BEFORE THE WEDDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING HAIR DYE WET HAIR AND SPREAD EVENLY. LEAVE ON FOR 30 MINUTES, RINSE OFF. Girl, smile. Others are using Bluetooth, but you have red teeth. That's some advanced technology. Later, I'll help you add a row of rhinestones. Luxurious. All right, let me help you think of a constructive solution. Do you have correction fluid? It can hide the color. Wang Yi-yang, I can't just sit here and say nothing. Even if I don't talk, I have to smile. I can't have a long face the whole time. You should learn from those high-society ladies who don't laugh with their teeth. A fair lady should have a gentle and soft smile. But when you smile, your alveolar ridge is there for all to see. Take this opportunity to learn to smile nicely. - Lu Ran. - Everyone's here. - Just about everyone. - We were just waiting for you. What are you doing? I can't talk to him. Just watch me. Wait for the signal and push him away. I'll make you extremely happy today. But remember, you are not allowed to show your teeth no matter how happy you are. We'll talk later. Hello. Hello, I'm Wang Yi-yang, Xiao-xian's boyfriend. Lu Ran. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Xiao-xian is sick today. What's wrong? Damage to her vocal cords. The doctor said she can't talk for a while. Is it serious? Since she fell ill, she's been thinking about a lot of things she never thought about before. She told me the other day that her sickness was her punishment because she used to speak too harshly. So now she can't speak. Last night, Xiao-xian told me if she met you today, she wanted to say sorry. She was too bitter before and she had hurt you. I really want to spend the rest of my life with her. I really like her. She has become so gentle and nice after she got sick. Of course, timing is everything. Since Xiao-xian wanted to apologize, why not do it today? Let's forgo old grudges with a smile. Nowadays, you can still be friends after breaking up. You don't have to be strangers. She didn't sleep well last night, she was too nervous about seeing you. I feel relieved now that you've said this. I was afraid Xiao-xian would hate me. Since you're over me, I feel better too. It's a good thing and I wish you both the best. Thank you. Look, you are a man, you should make the first move. Just hug it out and turn the page. Xiao-xian, actually I... Okay. Let her go! What are you doing? Didn't I warn you before? Don't bother Xiao-xian again. - What do you mean? - What's wrong, Lu Ran? What do I mean? You follow her to the office and wait for her after. She doesn't pick up your calls, so you write to her, how classic! That's not all. I never thought you'd dare do this today. Look at her panting! - Are you blind? - Don't get angry, calm down. Stop pointing at me. Were you never taught to respect others? Were you never taught to be civil, to be polite? Do you still not understand why Xiao-xian broke up with you? You made me bring it up. Aren't you ashamed? Xiao-xian feels sorry for you. - Okay... - Lu Ran. Don't fight. I'm not fighting. Threatening me? Kidnapping the bride? I think you got the dates mixed up. Today's not our big day. When it is, we'll be sure to let you know. But this is someone else's wedding. Please call your parents and ask them whether it's proper to do this. - Bullshit! - Lu Ran. What's your problem? Let's go. Okay, go back to your seat. Okay, there's nothing to see. Go. Don't be scared, I'm here. Don't be scared. Thank you, fate, for letting us begin our relationship like this today. With our friends as our witnesses, we'll love each other for the rest of our lives. Thank you to our parents. We hope all the guests here today can feel our happiness. WILL YOU MARRY ME? Thank you, fate, for letting us end our relationship. Don't be sorry for me. I don't want your apology. I don't want you to feel you owe me. I want an equal relationship. When our relationship began, we genuinely loved each other. When it finished, we genuinely hated each other. I want you to know that we are equal. Around me, some people are saying "Congratulations" and some are saying "Thanks." Some are saying "Hope you have a son soon." Some are saying "One day, it'll be your turn." Some are drunk, some are laughing, some are crying. The one who's crying is me. She is moved by the wedding. I borrowed this tie from my brother-in-law. Don't wipe your nose with it, please. POST-BREAKUP, DAY 16 Mr. Wei, are you doing hot yoga here? What are you doing here? I came to pay the workers in the nearby village. Are you still hosting the wedding here? Li Ke still doesn't want to. We booked a hotel banquet room in the end. Good, it's so hot here. You would need two ambulances standing by if you hosted the wedding here. In case the guests get a heatstroke. Miss Huang, we don't work together anymore, so let's talk like friends. I really want to know why you hate Li Ke so much. Actually, I want to ask you a question on behalf of all the unmarried women out there. Go ahead. Look, you're good-looking and have a great career. You have so many choices. I don't know who you would choose after the selection process, but I don't think it should be a girl like Li Ke. Of course, you're no exception. I've met many couples like you and Li Ke. Many great guys I know are with girls who only talk about Louis Vuitton and Prada. If you talk about the essence of love, she'll most likely tell you that the limit you set on her credit card is the essence of your love for her. Why? Why has that become the norm? The answer is quite simple. Two words. Save trouble. What? Simply put, we want to find wives who can stick with us even when love fades away, as long as there are money and other material things. Can you accept that? Li Ke can. For her, love is a luxury, but Louis Vuitton is a necessity. For girls like you, Louis Vuitton is a luxury, but love is a necessity. The Louis Vuitton Group won't suddenly go bankrupt, but love can end in the blink of an eye. If I want to build a relationship, I have to make sure I have endless resources to sustain it. From that perspective, I'm very dependable. Your words have opened my eyes. They're well put and easy to understand. But, they're not convincing. Do you know why? Because you have no foundation. In relationships, you always take the easy path. That's because you've never dated a complex and emotionally sophisticated girl, right? Kind of. So, you don't have the right to criticize me. People have different sides, you can't judge me by my worst sides. Well, I thought we were discussing a general topic. Then don't make it seem like my life is already set. According to your theory, I'll never find a good husband. Calm down. I didn't mean that. You haven't dated me, right? Do you know my strengths and merits? Don't talk like you know everything. If guys like you meet a sophisticated girl, she'll definitely teach you a lesson. Miss Huang, I have an idea. Do you have any plans tomorrow after work? Shall we go on a date? Please don't misunderstand me. I just want to learn a lesson from a girl like you and see what it's like to go on a date with you. You're right. If I want to establish a theory, I need to do research. Just one date, we can do whatever you feel like. I'll watch and learn. What do you think? Hey, that diamond's crooked, are you blind? Okay, let's treat it as academic research. What is it? What is it? My landlord's son is getting married. He's giving my room to the newlyweds' so I'm going to lose it. What a shock! I helped you get revenge so why am I the one who's getting punished? Don't be so pessimistic. Moving to a new place could mean better Feng Shui. How can I not be pessimistic? If I can't live there, I'll have to rent a two bedroom in Da Xing and get up at 4:30 a.m. or rent a balcony with four other guys near Guo Mao. That'll be tragic. Look, their requirements for the shared apartment are ridiculous. "I hope you have a good sense of humor." What does that mean? Do I have to perform stand-up comedy before going to bed every day? In my opinion, your only option now, is to cry to Mr. Wang. Maybe he'll let you live in our lounge area. So you're kicking away the ladder? Huang Xiao-xian. I'm going to go, talk to you later. How's the eight-minute speed date project coming along? I'm going to set up the venue tomorrow. I promise there won't be any problems this time. After the speed date project, you're in charge of this. If you screw up, you'll be fired. A golden wedding? We haven't handled this kind of project in a while. Great! I'LL WAIT FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS. WEI YI-RAN Huang Xiao-xian. They have a special grilled fish that tastes like watermelon. It's expensive. I would rather eat real watermelon. Let me order something more elegant. Grilled white chessman. Are you sure? Why? If I'm not sure, can I ask help from the audience? Okay, let's order it. Enjoy. Is it good? Yes. It tastes like lamb's kidney. They are about the same. It's blowfish sperm. Are you still grossed out? Yes. I never had such negative feedback after treating a girl to dinner. What's the next stop? Shall we go drink something? Let's go to Oriental Plaza. Now you are just like Li Ke. She likes to go for a walk and shop there after dinner, as exercise. Let's go there. Great view. You would never know the view up here if you're busy spending money in those shops. When I was in college, my boyfriend and I had a date here once. He took me to Haagen-Dazs. We don't have to pretend to be yuppies, and have Haagen-Dazs instead, but you didn't have to stuff yourself like this. Don't talk to me. I'm so full that I want to vomit. What's in my stomach is mine. What an awkward date. Guess what happened next? What happened? We had our first kiss. You were still in the mood for kissing after stuffing yourself? It was a nice moment. It's almost that time. Do I look nice under these lights? Now that we're here, we shouldn't waste it. Let's kiss before we leave. I only smelled it when you got closer. Although your cologne is expensive, you have the smell of a bastard. Miss Huang, are you pranking me? We never said it was a sincere date. You didn't have to have dinner with me tonight. I just want you to understand one thing. Some girls take you to Oriental Plaza and make you spend money on them. Some other girls make you come here to kiss you in front of the great view and to show you the beautiful night view of Beijing. I'm not saying which girls are better. I just want you to know that you have a choice that could make you happier. I admit that I would pursue girls like you if I were five or six years younger. Lu Ran, hurry. Can you hold me? Hurry up. Everyone, it's almost done, right? Let's rehearse. Tomorrow is the day. Begin. Why the long face? I have nothing to say to you. I know why, but you've misunderstood. It's not what you think. Then what is it? Wei Yi-ran was having cold feet, so I punished him on behalf of the Women's Federation. I doubt it. Don't tell me that just because you got hurt, you've become a professional mistress who splits up engaged couples? Who said I got hurt? Let me tell you. One day, when I get rich, I'm going to launch a country-wide hunt for all the professional mistresses, those who are and were. I'll have them all arrested, I won't spare a single one. I'll tie them together in groups of ten, stick a rocket in the middle, and send them all to outer space! Better now? Let's have a speed date. How old are you? Have you been married, had a serious illness, or committed a crime? Do you have an apartment? Crap, I haven't found a place yet. Soon, I'll have to sleep on the street. Okay, since you helped me last time, I'll help you this time. Come on in, have a look. Buddy, we've seen eight apartments so far. If you want to stay in a nice neighborhood, maybe you should sell your kidney, or maybe... This place is a real steal. It has great value and top quality. It was supposed to be the apartment of a newly married couple. Look at the interior design, how stylish! But they broke up before moving in. So the guy rents it out. Also, you can rent the whole place or share it with others. Does it suit you? You don't need two rooms for yourself. But if you co-rent, you'll have to share it with a family of three. But it may be a good thing to have a family feeling. They have an eight-month-old baby. It's the cutest age. Did you hear that? An eight-month-old baby. You can take advantage of it and learn how to be a good father and husband. If you get along well, maybe they'll ask you to be the baby's godfather. - Huang Xiao-xian. - Yes? - Let's take this place together. - Pardon? Man, what a bold move. Ladies and gentlemen, the eight-minute speed date, hosted by Zhenai, officially starts now. I can do these things in eight minutes. But what I can't do is... I'm 27. I'm from Tianjin, but I went to college in Beijing. I'm from Beijing. I want my future husband to be someone who has his own apartment. But we have to pay the mortgage together. I want my other half to be... First, no shorter than 175cm. Gentle and sweet. Second, be a good son. I prefer long hair. - Third, have a stable job. - I prefer someone from Beijing. Fourth, have a kind heart. I'm just starting in my career, but I'm full of potential. Fifth... To be honest, you are not my type. I think you are a little overweight. So I don't think I need to introduce myself. It's okay, I don't like you either. Let's just take a break. How many successful matches do you think will be made? Well... Twenty matches, I guess. You are too optimistic. My guess is five matches at most. You are too pessimistic. Do you want to bet? If there are more than ten matches, you win. And I'll do your work for you for a month. If there are less than ten matches, you'll have to take the apartment with me. How can you bet on other people's happiness? It's not good for karma. Okay, the eight minutes are up. Gentlemen, please stand up and exchange seats. The next eight minutes begins. How many matches were made? - Love at first sight? - Yes. Let me count. Three pairs. Only three? Yes. Only three pairs decided they found what they were looking for. Others come to meet as many people as possible. Okay, flip it. Smells nice. - You can season to taste. - Yes. You can also use butter. You'll get a nicer color. POST-BREAKUP, DAY 24 Coming. Congratulations on Huang Xiao-xian's first cooking effort. I'll become a top chef. Does it taste good? It's almost 25 days. Why am I still thinking about him? OKAY, LET'S BE ROOMMATES WHATEVER HAPPENS, TWO IS BETTER THAN ONE. Who is it? What are you doing here so early? Since we have time, let's move today. I'm here to help you pack. No, I'm still sleeping. You go ahead, I won't disturb you. I want to sleep. Okay, I'll start with the expensive things. I'm the most expensive thing in this room. Well, Miss Most Expensive Thing, you have a hole in your pajamas. Huang Xiao-xian. If you don't fold your clothes properly, they'll be completely creased. Huang Xiao-xian, do you want all these magazines? Even if you don't, I won't suggest you throw them away. Do you know what you can do with them? You can tie them together and paint them, turn them into a table. Huang Xiao-xian. Do you have one of those folding boards for clothes? They're really useful. I have three at home. I can't live without it. Huang Xiao-xian, have you read these books? They're moldy now. What are you doing? Leave it there, I'll do it. You... Wang Yi-yang, let me remind you. When I'm sleepy, my morals go out the window. So stop bothering me. Otherwise, I cannot take responsibility for what I do to you. What do you think? It looks perfect, right? Did you do all this? The television loses its signal, I always have to kick it, and you wrapped it as if it were a sick patient. Was that necessary? Oh, wow. A guy who is so good with housework... You scare me. Huang Xiao-xian, it's not me, it's you. You don't live like a woman. Plus, I enjoy this process. Say that again. You're right, I don't live like a girl. So I don't deserve to live with you, right? Get out, I'm not moving anymore. Huang Xiao-xian, what are you talking about? Why are you saying that all of a sudden? We can complement each other, don't you understand? Okay, don't be angry. I'll make you a special summer drink. Ice cold water. Let's prepare to move. Wang Xiao-jian, I want to go out now, I'll unpack tonight. No, you have to unpack right now. I will have a heart attack if I see this mess. Mr. Wang, normal guys have heart attacks when they meet hot girls. - Why are you going out anyway? - I have to get a haircut. Can't you see how long my bangs are? I can't work with hair in my face. Just cutting your bangs? I'll do it. You? Do you know how to do it? Do you have a license from a hairdresser's training school? Wait here. Is this reliable? Yes, relax. Do you know? Cutting it like this gives you an especially soft and natural look. Okay, close your eyes. You won't cut my eyelashes, will you? Your eyelashes are not long enough to be cut. - Huang Xiao-xian. - Yes? Do you have any pet peeves? Pet peeves? Now that we're living together, is there anything I cannot do in front of you? Just tell me. Being a jerk. You're being snarky again. Come on, seriously. I don't have any pet peeves, really. That's so pathetic. Everyone has pet peeves nowadays. Like Cici said, in this world, in this generation, you don't feel like you can meet with friends unless you're depressed or something. When I sleep, I need to have the blanket 5cm above my belly button. When I'm on my period, I can't be near oil or smoke. Otherwise, the smell makes me vomit. My bed must be facing the sun. Otherwise, the flowers on my blanket will die. Crap. What's wrong? Did you screw up? No. Move aside! Wang Xiao-jian, can you explain this? You can't blame me. It's because this bowl has a dent. What now? I'll use the other side. Miss Huang. I'll order the last wedding gown. It's simple and nice. Yu-lan will look great in it. Okay, we'll do as you wish. It's pretty. I asked them to tailor it overnight. Mr. Chen remembered your measurements so clearly. It'll fit you perfectly. Xiao-xian, are you married? I once had someone I could marry, but we broke up. Why? He fell in love with another woman. Did you find that he was different before he broke up with you? No, I didn't. That's not possible. You are not sensitive enough. Auntie Zhang, it's not me. I couldn't stop it anyway. We weren't like Mr. Chen and you. We are all the same. Let me tell you a secret about Mr. Chen. When he was young, he hurt me too. He made terrible mistakes as well. I'll get some hot water. You just did that. There's another thermos, we don't need it now. The meal should be here soon, I'll go check. Ms. Zhang, do you have another family member in the hospital? I keep seeing your husband downstairs in the surgery ward with a patient. Is that patient your family member? What happened next? Did you think about divorcing Mr. Chen? Divorce? I'm not crazy. Family? I'm here. It's a boy, six kilograms and seven ounces. The guarantee period on a refrigerator is three years. How can you guarantee a marriage for life? When a problem appears, fix it. Liu. I'm Chen's wife, I wanted to visit you. - You're also in this hospital? - Yes. Chen never told you about me, but he told me all about you. I'm here for a minor operation. I met Chen quite by chance the other day, and he took good care of me. That's nice of him. Don't blame him if he didn't tell you that I'm staying in the hospital for a good reason while you are here for a bad reason. We're both having operations here. You are having something taken out. My baby will be loved by the whole family. He will grow bigger and taller. We are not the same. How could he tell you? Chen made me fish soup, he made me have it every day, I'm really sick of it. So, I'm bringing some for you. Didn't you say you have no one taking care of you? Drink it while it's hot. Chen told me yesterday that fortunately, since we had a boy, we don't need to worry about him too much. If we had a girl, we'd have to worry if she doesn't date good guys when she grows up. Or if she doesn't marry well, or has any disgraceful behavior, we would have a tough life, don't you agree? Yes. I'm tired, I want to rest for a bit. Take care of yourself especially since you are alone. Also, try to get rid of your bad habits, otherwise, you'll be in the hospital again. You don't get sick for no reason. Okay, I should go. Enjoy the soup. She left the hospital the next morning. Don't you feel any regret? I have too many things to regret in life. But I don't regret this. I told Chen. "If you still think of her, go with her. I have my baby now. I don't need anything more. I'll cut you off like you're an appendix, and forget you." "If you don't want to live with her, then I'll just think of this as something that helped me to get through. We don't need to talk about it in the future." When I saw the contact lens solution, I suddenly understood. No one can withdraw from a relationship without being hurt. I used to be Lu Ran's dream. In every dream he had for the future, I was there. When we ended our relationship, we suffered a great defeat. I ruined these dreams of his and he owed me the future that he promised. POST-BREAKUP, DAY 33 Does anyone want peppermint flavored ice cream? I made it myself. I bought an ice cream machine today. You are so quiet today. Did something happen? Okay, I'll come back. Wait, leave the ice cream. Look at you, turning 30 and what are you doing every day? I think the Research Center for Troubled Children should conduct research on you. It tastes good. I mixed it with Guo Xian Mei. How did you make it? It's a very complicated process. You have to mix cream with egg whites, whip them until they are perfectly mixed. Right, look what I had to go through. My arm is swollen, see? - Yes, I can. - They are totally different sizes. Where did you get the cream? You have a big pack of Oreos. I ate the cookies and licked the cream out. Just kidding, I bought the cream. How about the peppermint? I put some toothpaste inside. Liar. It's true. Wang Xiao-jian. Let me see your swollen arm. You see? Look. - Okay, let me see. - See? Poor you, why didn't you break your arm? What are you doing? You can eat toothpaste, I always ate it when I was a kid. And even froze tubes of it. Sorry, Miss Huang. I didn't want to trouble you. But I'm afraid Yu-lan won't make it to the wedding. I'm sorry for your loss. She left me. She left first. I'll wash her face. YU-LAN I PUT YOUR FAVORITE CHOCOLATE IN THE LEFT POCKET OF YOUR SHIRT. ONCE YOU REACH HEAVEN REMEMBER TO EAT IT RIGHT AWAY OR ELSE IT'LL GO BAD SHU-KUN REQUIREMENT: CLASSIC LOCATION: BEIJING HOTEL THEME: TRADITIONAL COLOR: ELEGANT AND QUAINT My breakup was like a painful operation on my brain. I had to cut out all the memories I had with the guy who betrayed me. My so-called ego, demands, stubbornness, and arguments were all causes for the breakup. Whenever problems arose, I usually complained instead of listened. I never cooperated. Instead, I attack. I wanted to tell these to Auntie Zhang. Hello? Huang Xiao-xian, walk to the window. What are you doing? Just walk a few steps to the window. I'm by the window, now what? Are you persuading me to open it and jump? What do you see? Nothing but black. Okay, countdown from three. Wang Xiao-jian, I'm not in the mood today. Okay, I'll count for you. Three, two, one. Do you see me? Here. I'm standing below the T. Do you see me? I see you. Don't move or you'll fall. I noticed that you always stand by the window. I did it as well the other day and realized that there was nothing to look at especially at night. But I also discovered, there's this neon light. It hasn't been used since our company moved in. It took me great efforts to find someone to light it. Now with the light, you'll have a better view when you stand by the window from now on. Wang Xiao-jian. Thank you. What are you saying? I don't know what to say next. Huang Xiao-xian, as these lights are my witness, I promise you that no matter what happens, I'll be within one meter of you. What did you just say? The reception's bad, can you say that again? Huang Xiao-xian, I'll be there for you. I still can't hear you, come again? I'll be there for you. MAY 33RD, TUESDAY JUNE 1ST, WEDNESDAY - I'm Swallow Tao. - Toby. - I'm Wang Xing-wen. - I'm Chen Xin-chan. I currently work as an assistant event coordinator. I'm an auto accessory installer. I work at an advertising company. I'm a wedding videographer. I just broke up. - It's been three days. - It's been 50 days. It's been 273 days. It's almost been three years. Because my ex-boyfriend left me for my best friend. - It was a crush. - Family and apartment pressure. - I am older than him. - I'm headstrong. I couldn't keep up the long distance relationship in the end. DISTANCE Maybe he has found love now. I don't have enough money now. It's as simple as that. I rapidly lost 20 pounds after the breakup. I even got down on my knees for her. It was really painful, really bitter. I remember saying to her, "If one day, for whatever reason, you want to leave me, I won't blame you. Because if a man can't keep his girlfriend, he is not good enough." Breaking up... I lost a kind of faith. I would say it's a kind of pain. I would say I learned to grow up. I don't think it was all for nothing. It made my heart ache, but it also reminded me of how wonderful it was. I guess breaking up is losing something you've grown accustomed to. Who hasn't broken up with someone before? THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS INEVITABLE In the two years that I waited for you, I missed a lot in life. But now, I know how to choose my Mr. Right. LOVE WITH PASSION BE STRONG EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT LOVED I hope he will find a girl who understands him, a girl who will remember... to accompany him to Jay Chou's concert every year. Like I always said, if you are tired, or brokenhearted, you can always come back to me, as long as I am not married yet. At this moment, I still can't let go yet. But from this date onward, I've made a promise to myself to forget her and start a new relationship. Maybe we were too young and immature when we were together. I hope all is well with your work. I hope your family will always be healthy. I hope you'll find happiness. You were my first love, and you will always be a treasured memory in my life. If you happen to see this video one day, I hope you will forget me, forever. The best way to get over a past relationship is to engage in a new relationship. Losing love isn't necessarily a bad thing. Maybe it's the beginning of future happiness.
