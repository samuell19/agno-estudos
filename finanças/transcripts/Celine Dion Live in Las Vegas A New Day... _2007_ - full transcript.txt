It started in 1999, and I was doing a world tour. And we were finishing this tour in December 31st. At the end of this night we were about to leave for Vegas. We had decided to bring all our families and friends to Las Vegas to have fun, to get into year 2000. This is the first day of a two year off. I was about to take two years off to take a break, relax and try to have a baby and then, who knows. We decide to go to see the Cirque du Soleil, the show O, from Franco Dragone. The show was finished and Céline wouldn't move, you know. She stayed glued to her seat, crying and laughing, it's an incredible show. I look at my husband and I say, "If I come back in show business this is the type of show I'd like to do." I insist to go backstage and to say hello and to congratulate all the performers. And I say "You know, all of you guys are so amazingly talented and generous but you give beyond your talent. You changed a bit of my life today." I took the initiative to write her a letter, in order to tell her how much I appreciate her attitude towards the artists and also that it would be a pleasure, and an honor for me if one day we could just meet or even dream, or think, maybe to do something together. I thought that it was an incredible coincidence, destiny, so I gave him a call, invited him to come to see us when he would come to the United States. And he came to our house in Florida, we met. I said "You wanna work with me, I'd love to work with you." It was really, we say in French, a "coup de foudre" which is really, you fell in love with these people very fast. Céline and him started talking and dreaming. We talked very fast about doing a project together at the size of O. So my job was to get the deal done. The deal that was done for A New Day with Céline was the biggest contract ever negotiated for an artist for a live entertainment deal. So it was the biggest deal in the history of the music business. We were talking about an investment of over $300 million. When you consider the magnitude of the deal it's pretty amazing in this day and age that you can find people that, in one meeting you fall in love with the vision, fall in love with their personality and you shake hands on a deal like this. If you're gonna gamble, Las Vegas is the place to do it. When I heard of this deal, we didn't own Caesars Palace. We were a competitor. It was such a big deal, there was so much money involved, in building the Colosseum and in what Céline earns out of the deal, that it struck me originally as enormously risky. And it was unprecedented that you could sell more than 4,000 tickets to one performer's show, five or six nights a week, weeks and weeks and, in fact, years and years. So it was quite a stunning notion. I was, in fact, a little skeptical when I first heard about it. It has been successful beyond anyone's imagination, really. So once we had all agreed on the deal, we were very excited and Franco started working. We began the casting and we did, I think, we auditioned 1,000 dancers... ...I think all over the world. We danced our butts off. It started off interesting. We just had to walk. And from walking across stage, people were getting cut already. From 1,000 people, we had to go to 50, 58. Everybody came in Belgium. We begin with the dancer, really to create different vocabulary, different choreography. There was an electricity in the air and we knew that we were all part of something and we had the time to bond together. Everyone was on a level playing field. Everyone had sort of come there from all different parts of the world and different backgrounds and we just knew we were gonna be part of something great. Everybody started to work on that project. Then I got pregnant. And then I started to realize that I haven't had a life before. When I had my son I didn't want to... ...l didn't want to perform in Las Vegas anymore. I just met the most extraordinary... I had a life for the first time. I knew then that I wanted to have more success as a mother than a singer. And... I told René that I didn't want to do that anymore, and that if it was possible, to kind of stop the project. Finally, he came back to me and he said "You know, it's too advanced. There's too many people involved. It's too much money, and I'm afraid to say that... ...we'll have to go on with it. It was probably one of the hardest moments of my life as a... as an artist, because all my life before having a son, before having a child that's all I wanted, I wanted to succeed, I wanted to perform, I wanted to be part of the biggest show, I wanted to be busy and express myself through music. And I realized that it was more than that in a life, in my life now. And it was hard. And my son was born and... ...I had to face that new journey. I hoped for a year but we already had engaged ourselves to two or maybe three. I don't even remember. We moved to Vegas, my son was a year and a half. Started to rehearse, we went to Belgium. In October, November, I think, 2002, Céline, René and all the family and the little René-Charles, they came in La Louviére and we presented to them. Thank God for Céline, she walked in and, first of all, we just all did a standing ovation. And it was great because she walked in, not as the diva you would've imagined. She didn't have any makeup on. Immediately, she took off her shoes and she welcomed us instantly. WE felt that connection with her. And we were just so grateful that this was the woman we were working for. She was so positive and we got to show her what we'd been working on. And her response was unbelievable. She was wiping her eyes, she couldn't believe how beautiful it was, like, she was just so excited and her excitement for the project just rejuvenated us, it rejuvenated our spirits. And that was so badly needed at the time. And thank God for Céline. You are an inspiration because what I'm not capable of doing, you're doing it, you're doing it with me, for me, for you, for us. And the most thing that I'm sad about is I won't be able to sit every night in the audience to look at you because I'll be with you onstage. But I might do this. I have to say that until Céline and Reneé arrived in Belgium, I was still, I don't know, this project was still a kind of abstraction. Maybe real, maybe not real. Then, when I saw Céline and René in Belgium... I say "Il think this project, it's real." Once I commit myself I wanted to finish it, professionally. I'm gonna go and finish it all. I'll do it all the way. And in December of 2002 everyone moved here in Las Vegas. The theatre was ready. The construction of the building took exactly 14 months from where it was a hole in the ground to a finished theatre. This is something that can't happen anywhere else in the world. Las Vegas has the ability to fast track construction. The theatrical consultants for the building was Scéno Plus and they were responsible for the original conceptual design of the building. A round building, two balconies, 4,000 seats. So our theater has twice as many seats as the Cirque du Soleil O theater but the furthest seat is only 120 feet so it's a more intimate theater for twice as many people. One of the challenges we had when we put the sound system together was the fact that the theater is round. When you're a sound person a round building is really not fun to work with. You have many reflections, all coming back to the center where Céline is standing. So it took us quite a few times to get the speakers at the right place where we could actually have the echoes not coming back straight at her but more diffused. So that was a big challenge to the thing. I saw the theater. Beautiful. Great big machine, impressive, motivate me a lot. In the same time impressed and stressed me. It's a big challenge for a singer to perform in the desert, to perform every night in a dry environment. So my specification for the Colosseum, for the theater, was to have humidity onstage every night, and for sure humidity in my dressing room every night. So very often before the shows and after the shows I have a machine... ...that I do some Broncho Saline. I humidify my nose with saline every day. The desert, it's better to do it a couple times a day. And I also do the Broncho Saline one. So I do a couple squirts of saline into this little machine that I breathe. So it's not oxygen. It's saline. So it goes through my vocal cords, the back of my throat, larynx, the lungs and it goes into the bronchial. And it moisturizes everything. It's very important. The scenic designer for Franco Dragone, Michel Créte, came up with the idea of being able to see the entire performer and the surface of the stage and the back wall of the stage, the screen as a way of building the context to put Céline's music into. And so he came up with the idea of using a raked stage. And our stage is at 5.7 degrees, which is about twice as steep as even an opera stage. The most difficult stage I've ever performed on. Actually, I think a lot of artists, some left because it was too hard. Took about three months to adjust to that. That's one of the most difficult things of this show, is dancing repetition on that, because of the impact on your joints, night after night. Everything's gotta give and just the angle you land changes everything and it's quite difficult. The original concept for the back wall of the theater was that it was going to be a big, white cyc and we were going to be projecting video on that cyc. And that would be how we would change the context of the songs. But me as a lighting designer, I was like if you put a big white wall and I have dancers going and the cross lights and everything, it's gonna be a nightmare for me. So I was really pushing for another type of technology. So Yves proclaimed that what we really needed was an LED screen. And everybody kind of winces because it's just huge money. I had another discussion with one of the accountants of the company and he was giving me shit, "You're crazy to make René and Céline spend that amount of money. And are you nuts?" He said at the end of the phone, he said "But, you know what? I just talked to René and he wants it.” So I was like, oh, I have René on my side. We're looking at about $10 million. And... ...René kind of nodded his head. And he went back to Phil Anschutz who had already paid for the millions of dollars that it took to produce the show and said, "Phil, you wanted the best show you could possibly have in this theater that they're building for us. And the only way we're going to be able to do that is to buy an LED screen and it's gonna be $10 million.” And René is a salesman and a gambler and he was able to convince Phil to come up with that extra $10 million. And it was the best money he's ever spent. So, when I received a "yes", we were able to say that, OK, A New Day, Céline Dion will have the biggest indoor screen in the world. The rumor on the strip, as people like to say around here, was that now that we had come up with a show that was so much more expensive, so much bigger, so much more, that it couldn't possibly work. A few weeks before the opening... ...everyone was very nervous. Our partners were nervous because we're talking about millions and millions of dollars, not knowing if this show is gonna work, if this formula is gonna work in Las Vegas. People at Caesar's Palace who built the theater for this and invested a lot of money were nervous, and I can understand them. Franco was very nervous because, you know, it's his responsibility, he's the director. First rehearsal with Céline, I could not stay more than ten minutes in the theater because it was really for me, I could not breathe. I had really panic attack. So I was so... ...I realized how much the myth... ...Céline is so universal, that I was really scared. Unfortunately, two weeks prior to the premiere, I got really sick. And I got sick with the bronchitis and a sinus infection and asthma and the whole shebang. And I was brand new in Las Vegas, I was not adjusted to the climate over there. Living in a desert, singing in a desert, it's quite difficult. Sinus problem, one after the other, I got really sick. So that two weeks of rehearsal, I was in bed, waking up every four hours to do treatments for asthma, doing like stuff for my nose and breathing humidity and it was a mess. She had a problem with her voice. We lost a few weeks of rehearsals. So it was really a puzzle... ...to manage. And we arrived at the premiere very vulnerable. Premiere time... Makeup, hair, dress, I don't even know if everything fits. It's beyond... I'm not... I'm not ready. I don't know if they were but I was not. My parents, both parents are there, the whole show business is there. And I'm saying to myself, "I have nothing to lose.” If it... If it doesn't work and it's terrible, I go home to my son and sell everything and I start all over again as a mom. She was reassuring me. She was really... she took the place and she was the, I'd say, the mother of the family. She, she say, she encouraged everybody, when everybody were more stressing. You know, this is what really... ...really impressed me very much. The opening night, 2003, March 25th. Big night, everybody was very nervous, of course. We thought everything was in place. Well, so we sent Céline for the opening on the show, onstage everything was working fine. And for one of those changes she'd come out to do the quick change. And there was a very fast one, something like 40 second quick change. No shoes. There was someone, one of our technicians, I think, I don't want to put the blame on someone but he just moved a pair of shoes. because it's pre-set, you know. You have shoes, we have, you know, pants and blouse and everything, shirt, right there. So the shoes were moved maybe five feet away. But excitement and the rush and we didn't saw the shoes. So Céline put pants on, shirt, and I sent her onstage naked, you know, barefoot. Here I am onstage, bare feet, and I say to Mom "Don't worry, Mom, I'm fine. Anybody wear a size 38 in the audience?" Everybody started to laugh, and finally, Titoff, who is like the messenger, comes onstage with my shoes that they found three, four minutes later. And I'm giving him the microphone and I'm putting my shoes and I'm on the edge of a step. And I said "OK, fine." And... ...people thought, because I made jokes with it, and they thought it was part of the theatrical aspect of the show. In opening week, in March of 2003, we used to stand out in the lobby and listen to peoples' comments, just going out to gauge what type of a show we had, whether people were happy with it, didnt like it, whatever. And a lot of comments were, "lI don't know why they have such a big production because I only came to hear her sing.” In show business, it's the public that decides everything. And when they came here, they wanted to see Céline, they wanted to hear her sing her hits. And the magic of Franco is that he found a way... ...finally, to take advantage of Céline's charisma and great talent and blend it with 50 people onstage and produce a unique show that has never been seen before. The most important... ...problem to solve in the show with Céline was the balance between theater, I would say, and concert. You must wonder, "Where are the musicians?” Here they are! The first shows, the musicians were not onstage, something that was really frustrating for the band, because we used to be the show, you know. Like on tour there was no dancers, we do the show. So being hidden at the time was very hard on the musicians' egos. And so we discussed it, we discussed this matter. We worked on this to bring them more and more into the show. I would say that at the beginning, the connection between dance, circus, like Cirque du Soleil, pop singer, the connection was not done. It was like three separate worlds. And we had to bring this together, you know. I really think that now the balance between concert and theater are much more interesting. I stopped flying because I needed surgery. I loved flying because I love to do hard things and I love when, not to put my life in jeopardy, but to challenge myself, actually. To put a harness every night and to fly six stories and try to sing and be strangled in my belly every night was quite a technique challenge for me. I had to quit doing it because it was dangerous. At the beginning of the project, Céline and Franco thought about Céline having a new look. So, you know, I was listening, I thought it was a great idea, until I learned that the new look they were talking about was cutting her hair short and dye it blonde. At first, it was a technical situation. The stage pushed my hair forward and I always had to play with my hair to get it out of my face and people could not see my face well. So it was probably the most expensive hair color and hair cut in the whole industry. And it cost a lot of money because everybody hated it and we did a DVD video show with the short, white hair and we had to throw it in the garbage because it was terrible. Every time I saw her onstage, if I would've been thinking only as her manager, I would've insisted on both of them to really push my point about the image. But Céline was so excited to change something, to start, you know, with a new look, and so into it and so happy about it that the husband took over. And I wanted her to be happy and love what she's doing and get into this project with the right attitude. So I said, "OK, if you wanna do that, sure, go ahead, do it." Well, I decided to go back to my original, kind of like long, brown hair because I... ...well, people hated it, actually. And my husband's partner, Dave Platel said to me, "You know, don't take it wrong. You're not a hairdo. You know, it's, people hate it and... It's because you're probably the only thing that doesn't change in their lives. You're stability for them. Her core fans, who own Céline, they love her for who she's been for all of their lives. They've been following her for 15, 20 years, and it was a bit of a shock to them. So eventually, we had to, you know, revert back to what everyone loves to see her in. She looked good in the short, blonde hair, you know. But the fans weren't ready for it. They wanted their Céline. The public has the last word. Today, we have a show that it's a look that is a kind of a conclusion, a result of several input and Céline being the leader of the costumes. To freshen up the whole thing we decided to change the costumes, new hair, extensions and new makeup and work with my stylist Annie Horth, that I used to work with. And ask Serge Normant to come and recreate the hair. And ask Zane, my stylist who's doing my own hair every night to re-adjust and help me to go through this every night. To ask Scott Barnes to kind of redo the makeup for me and show me, to do a new way and, so designing new makeup. I think before it was more theatrical. The show being very theatrical... ...for the last year, I think Céline wanted to have, you know, a more fashionable and modern approach to her looks for the stage. For the change for River Deep we have a dress, very short in metal, it's all in chains from Alexander McQueen. Céline looks fantastic in it. She has amazing legs. So it was very exciting to add this very sexy number to the show. That strength, sex appeal, everybody... ...walking forward and like lights coming down onstage. It's a different color from the whole show. There's a moment we're all around Céline and the fan is blowing on her and we're all doing this movement and you just feel her energy. And we can look at each other and so the rapport and the connection we have amongst all the dancers with Céline at the center. It's very symbolic, really, of this show, that Céline is the center of our world right now and we owe everything to her like we're all praising her and thanking her. She's living and we're living. Get the stick out of the microphone, turn my back into the audience, look at my dancers... Shiny legs, shake the behind a little bit. Of course, the manager in me thinks that it's... ...a great number that people love, great production, great ideas. But the husband really thinks that his wife is beautiful and she looks great. Our show has many, many stories. We've been together five years now and we've been living life together. There are some good secrets, some good stories. One of the stories I have is a couple of years ago Céline became ill. We cancelled the show for about two weeks. It was pretty serious. And the dancers were concerned. We wanted to show her that we were thinking of her. We wanted to show her that we were concerned, we wanted to cheer her up. So we decided that we were gonna send her a card and we were gonna send her a cast photo. So we all got onstage and we took off all our clothes. And we took costume parts and pieces and we strategically placed them, maybe they were hands or other peoples' hands, you know, on certain parts and we had a blast doing this photo shoot. And, of course, you know our show is called A New Day. Well, we sent her the card and we sent her the photo and we lovingly re-titled the show A Nude Day because we just wanted Céline to know that we felt naked without her. During Seduces Me, Céline's sitting in a large chair and we have only male dancers coming in. I came, I tried to follow all those dancers, I was the one just before the last one. I was, you know, like the other guys. But I was trying to keep my belly in. I was like... You know, like a dancer, because dancers have a shape not like mine, you know. So I was walking onstage and when I just go through, you know, Céline, I was walking up from the chair. She was thinking about what the song was. Didn't see me yet, and then, when she opened her eyes I was just up front of her and I let my belly go, like... You know, and she was, "Ten seconds after I have to sing." Can you imagine in your head, try to control the laughing and everything. That was amazing. That was my brother. There's a thing I could say because she probably won't hear that before it's out and the secret will still be here with us until the DVD is out. We changed the time on her clock. It's five years she doesn't know about it. Five years that her clock is three minutes earlier. It makes a big difference, three minutes is the world for us for her to be ready a little bit more on time and she doesn't know it until this day. So that would be a surprise. Il am so in a rush. Almost there. Almost there. During the course of our stay here, there are celebrities that come, not every night but on and off. Some want to be noticed or Céline will introduce them from stage and some don't want to be... Incognito, you can't even tell they're here. Anthony Hopkins was gonna be in the house and we decided, well, what can we do? ‘Cause he didn't want anybody to know that he was there. But we wanted to do something so he knew that we knew. I went to wardrobe department and they made up a shirt that tied like a straightjacket. And then, they went and got a mask and put a mask, just like Hannibal Lecter did and then, we used a regular dolly, they strapped me in with a loading strap and during the tourist cross, which is when all the tourists run across stage, they wheeled me out first, two guys wheeled me out and set me up and Céline never knows what's gonna happen and when she came down center stage I was leering at her like Hannibal Lecter would and she screamed. And they turn around and walked me off. And then, after the show, I ran out to the lobby. I took my mask and I went up to Mr. Hopkins and asked him if he'd sign it, which he did gracefully. And security staff said that all the way to his car, all he could talk about was what happened onstage. Can you call?! One of the many guests that we had that struck me the most, was when Mikhail Gorbachev went to meet Céline with his daughter, who's a really big fan of Céline. They were both just standing really straight, they didn't sit down. He had a security guard, the interpret, his daughter and him. I couldn't believe that you've got this guy who changed history was there meeting Céline and he was meeting her as a fan. And he was happy to see Céline. That was a big moment for me. Of course, so many celebrities from Hollywood came. Oprah came, Michael Douglas, Arnold Schwarzenegger came, Michael Jackson even came. I want to impress them, I want to impress myself. I want them to think, "Oh, my God! It was so good, so good." I want to impress them. You know, I'm proud. A very emotional moment came when her father passed away on November 30th, 2003. You know, we told her that of course she doesn't have to do the show. And she insisted on doing the show that night, ‘cause she said, "Dad would want me to do the show.” Tonight is a very special night for me. It is also... ...a very difficult day. I've lost my dad this morning. ...insisted on coming. My dad... ...was, and still... ...is my number one fan since I'm a very little girl. And... And I know that... ...my dad would have wanted me... ...to be here tonight, onstage, with everyone I love, doing what we love. And... We always think that we're so strong. But... ... know that he is here. And I will tonight, perform the very best I can. And I will give everything I have. And I would like to... ...to dedicate this show... ...to him. People were in pain as much as I was. It was awful. But I did it for my dad. I love you, Dad. I collapsed backstage after the show. Thank God my brother was there. That night I was not stage manager, but I was Céline's brother. And I'm very proud of it. And from that night, you'll see Céline every night doing a little sign up there because he's over here, over the Colosseum Las Vegas, and he's taking care of her and me and all the band members and all the family. I would love to dedicate this next song to all the parents and children of the world, and especially my very own, René-Charles. I have to say that my son was having a hard time with music when he started his life. And the reason why is because I was, actually, he didn't have any problems. I was having a problem with coming back in the industry after finding that my most amazing pleasure in life was to be a mom. And this difficulty that I had to come back in show business, my son went through this. When he was ready, he said to me "I wanna go and see the show." And I said "Which show?" He said "Your show.” I said, "Oh, all right. When?" He said "Now. Tonight." "Well," I said, I didn't want to be so impressed that he would change his mind so I said "Sure, but I leave in ten minutes.” He said "No problem, I'm ready. I'm like... So it was the first time in my life that I was nauseous. We all left together, he had his tickets in his hands, I was getting ready for the show. When this show started, my smile was hooked to my ears. It was the first new day of my life. And... I realized that my son has accepted me... ...as a singer. It was one of the best days of my career. I went in the audience after the show like every night. And I give the rose to someone. That night, I gave the rose to my son. And I took him in my arms and I went back onstage, I waved good night, we went home and we never talked about it. Since then, my son is successful as a human being, he's a happy kid, he's totally well, and I'm much better, because I can perform, I can be free and not worry. And... the best is yet to come. We're good. We're leaving Las Vegas. And she's the hottest act in Las Vegas. You know, year after year she's been voted the Entertainer of the Year in Las Vegas, the Show of the Year in Las Vegas. That's unusual because usually people come here, if they've got a good show they're gonna stay, some acts have been here for 15, 20 years, some even longer. So it's unusual for us, for an artist of her stature to come to Las Vegas, to begin with, and then to leave at the height of her career or the height of the Las Vegas show, is also unusual. So this past five years, it's a historical moment for sure. Céline Dion's arrival at Caesars Palace really initiated the revival of the property as one of the preeminent gaming properties in the world. She's one of the preeminent superstar celebrities and performers in the world, The fact that she would take up residence here and perform nightly in the Colosseum theater really brought a tremendous level of prestige and panache to Caesars Palace for our high-end guests from around the world. Céline had changed the face of Las Vegas because for the first time, you had an international star at the height of her career coming here to do a new show designed especially for Las Vegas. Now, many many superstars... ...are thinking of doing the same thing here. We're very proud to be their partner and we're very proud to be what is going to be the greatest live entertainment event ever. A New Day is not ending. A New Day is just reforming itself for another venture and another opportunity. So we'll be back. You know, the key to the success of this show is that everyone involved has an important role to play. From the person that deals with the electric wires, to the singer, they're all important. Céline knows that, everyone knows that. The biggest secret, or perhaps the question that I get asked most often about the show and when people discover that I work with Céline is, "Is she really as nice as she seems on television?" And I have to unconditionally answer that, "Yes, it's absolutely true.” It's not a facade. That's the strange thing when you meet her. You realize she's a simple person that has a true humility and honesty and she treats everyone with incredible respect as artists and as human beings. I want Céline to know that this show has been a gift, it's changed our lives and we are so grateful. This company goes above and beyond, you know, all their obligations to us. They've really taken care of us and I'm forever grateful to Céline. We became a family. We've lost people that we loved. Some gave birth to some children. Some left the stage because it was too hard for them, physically. Some had personal problems, left for eight months, came back to finish the journey with us. There was more than shows, there was more than songs and music and dance. It was a five-year journey, and it's a lifetime. Even though it was tough to start with, I have to say I'll miss it. Hey, guys, what's up? Well, 1 thought that... You know, I have nothing to do before the show. So what do you think if we do a tour? I'd love to invite you. Let's go and take a look. Only thing I ask for is humidity, in my dressing room, at home and onstage. There's humidity that comes out of here and it's saving my life. It's like an invisible wall. Right now, it's 30 percent humidity. So, Rick, do you mind to explain to us every time I go and see you and say, "Rick, you gotta give me more humidity, more humidity.” I'm a little bit rough with you. Explain to us what's going on. How does it work? So we produce our own water, we have a reverse osmosis system that makes water with zero minerals in it, no electrons, no nothing, it's just H20, pure water. Only in the desert. In the desert. We suck water out of Lake Mead and we pump it up on the stage. Oh, shoot! Oh, my... That will go on for a couple seconds and then it will stop. - Did it jump start the ticker? - No, but you didn't... I didn't know... Ladies and gentlemen, this is how it works backstage. It's gonna stop, right? - Any second now. - Any second. One, two... OK, I lied to you again. ...three... The claw! Well, actually, I can have myself a facial in the meantime. Look at those guys, they're partying. Oh, now, you're awake. Sorry. Playboy magazine. No, no, I'm working very hard. Playboy magazine. You see, not everyone's working really hard. And these are real pearls. You know, there's no such thing about having fake stuff, nothing's fake. We sing for real, we cry for real, we laugh for real we love each other for real, the pearls are real. We love each other. And this is real. How are you guys? - Are you doing homework? - Yes. - You're studying, right? - I'm studying. I'm studying to be an athletic trainer, in hopes to be a physical therapist. But that's a seven year process and we'll see if I make it that far. I'm sure you will. I'm sure you will. You know, Daniela has been, all of them have been incredibly talented troopers and more than talented, they've been very generous and very special people. Daniela is my stand-in, so every time we rehearse a new number, for example, she comes in at two in the afternoon for me to be able to sleep three hours more. And she does the work for me. And I love it. And I appreciate it. Every night when we bow, I kiss Elijah and he's putting white powder on my face and then I kiss Titoff and he puts brown. So I have my makeup, a white spot of Elijah, and a red cheek from Titoff. What's up, what's up, what's up! What's up!
