Subrip by DanDee There's talk of revolution. I've heard it spoken amongst the Outliers, an ungrateful few who question. I tell them... I tell them this will only anger Mother, but they don't listen. Their thoughts stray. Show me what you found. Let us begin. Mother Darken, you give us the air we breathe and the food we eat, you keep us safe from the outside; and for that, we are thankful. Darken provides. We all bow to our beloved Clarity. Our holy priestess, she will guide us through these troubled times. There is a traitor among us. In this room right now. You are drawn to this. You think this is what awaits you outside these walls. This is not outside. - This is a lie. - Sacrilege! Mother Darken protects us, but only within these walls. You must expose the exile or we will anger her. A reward awaits. The traitor must be known or we will all suffer. We need to protect ourselves against bad people who want to hurt us. This is for our survival. Stop! I'm the one you want. Karisse?! - How could you betray me? - We're no longer safe here. It gets darker every day. When we die, no one new comes. It's because Mother Darken is gone. Mother Darken is not gone! - Then let us speak to her. - She is angry that the Exiles dare to defy all she has built for us. Make an example of me. If the outside is death, send me there. You are so stupid. - Only Mother Darken can open... - If it's what you want. Mother's key, you have it. This key entrusted to me by Mother Darken herself to keep us safe from the hell that exists outside of Darken. But if it's what you want... Death waits for you outside. Beg for forgiveness, and I'll let you live. No. Then go. We purged the exile, and Mother Darken will reward us again. Darken will provide. - Hey. - Where are you? - At home. - I can't keep covering for you, Eve. I'll get in trouble. I know. I'm sorry. I just... Keep Nurse Selleck off my back for one more day, OK? You're not showing up for your shifts, you barely say a word when you're here; what's going on? It's just... ...work. You can't save everyone, Eve. Losing patients is part of the job. I'm coming over. Oh, my God! Somebody, help! What happened? It's OK, I'm a nurse. We just found her like this. I knew there was a world out here. I knew it. I knew it. Call 9-1-1. Find Taro. Tell him Karisse sent you. Tell him we can come back. There are others in there; you have to help them. Go! Tell the paramedics there might be others. Mother Darken, hear my prayer. Open the doors and you are there. Mother Darken, let me in. What? Open up! The door is jammed! Open the door! Hello? Is everyone OK? Phone is not in service. - This is a recording. - Shit! What is this? Ah. What the...? Wasn't I just here? Hello? Is anyone here? I'm a nurse, I'm here to help. Hello? Are there people here who need help? Are you Taro? Hey! Argh! Ow! - I'm here to help! - This is my room! I'm a medical professional! Has anyone been injured? Hello? Hello? Is Taro here? Oh my... Shut up. They'll hear you. Please. I'm lost. What room are you from? I don't know what you're talking about. Where are we? They're here. Who's here? - Wait! - No! I need your help. You're better off without us. Wait! - Who are you? - My name is Eve. I'm just a nurse. I don't know why I'm here. A woman told me to go through a door. She... She said there were people here. - She said her name was Karisse. - Karisse? Liar. We banished her. She's dead. Please... I just want to go home. I didn't realize how sick Darken was until this very moment. These other Exiles, I know them. They are quite... stubborn. Tell us where the others are, - and Mother will reward us all! - I don't know - what you're talking about. - This... ...is quite good at finding the truth. I told you, I don't know why I'm here. I just want to go back home. Godammit! Where are the windows?! It can't just be room after room. Where's the light? Where is the sun?! You are from the outside. Mother be praised. I must - take you to Clarity. - What about us?! Lackey! Look at you. You're not even a man, you're a coward! - Coward! - It is because of you that Mother Darken has forsaken us. You must die for your heresy, and all will be restored. A truth serum courtesy of our beloved Clarity. I will purge this place of all that angers Mother! AAAAAH! Help me! Help! Get me out of here! Noooo! Shit! Oh, what have I done? Let... let's go! No! She'll slow us down, make us more of a target. Fine. Who are these people? Why are they after us? I don't understand. This whole place was a sanctuary once created by Mother Darken herself. But not anymore. Where are we going? We're going deeper into Darken, away from them. You're so clean. I remember. May I have it? Please! I'll give you anything you want. Uh-huh? Uh, no. Maybe...? Oh, I used to have so much. Mother provided. She hasn't brought in the likes of you for quite a while. I wonder why it's been so long. - Let's go! - Here. Take this. They can see you. Who are they? Disciples. Why do they make that sound? They can find us with the sound? Like sonar? There's no escaping them. They can hear the tiniest movement with those devices that came through the door. They were trained by Clarity to kill those who oppose her. Who's Clarity? Our so-called priestess. Now move. - What is your name? - Eve. Her name is Mercy. Mercy. And you? Kali. Now if you want to live, move. Take the Mother's blood. No, not too much. I don't want you to forget the pain. I am whole again. Ugh! I am ready to serve you. This... this will not do. Well, then we'll make you look the part. Well, these modern styles don't suit me. I believe it's a marked improvement. You are too kind to me. You're certain she's from outside? Oh, yes. Isn't it glorious? Mother has brought us another. She's rewarding us for our war against the Exiles. - It means the outside is no... - This cannot be. - Bring her to me. - It is wondrous. You let her escape. Now, the Exiles will poison her mind as well. No, no, no, no. Please forgive me, my priestess. I have failed you as arbiter. I'll give you one more chance. Bring her to me. I'll take her to Mother. Yeah. Mother will be happy. I will bring this woman to you. I will not disappoint you again. There will be no forgiveness. You know your duty. Wait! It's time to flush out all of the Exiles. We must end their rebellion once and for all. - Destroy Haven. - But it is... it is a sacred place, a refuge, a place that Mother Darken decreed no violence should ever occur. - I have other means... - If Mother sent someone from the outside, then she is obviously pleased with our efforts to find the Exiles. She would want us to finish the job. Wouldn't she? Make sure there is - no sanctuary for them? - Yes. As always, you are... you are right. Quiet. What's going on? The light is leaving us. Mother is angry. Let's go. This is Darken. Where are we? How do we get out? You don't. That doesn't make any sense. What's beyond these borders? In the Darken, this is only one section. It can't just be room after room, there has to be an end. Why? Does your world have an end? Or a way out? What about here? "Haven." Maybe we can get help here. Mother Darken gave Haven to... for all to worship, but no place is safe anymore. Clarity has made that known. Is that why you're running from the Disciples? Something that happened in Haven? - Wait! - Don't touch me! I'm just trying to understand. We don't go to Haven. We keep moving; that's how we stay alive. Come. Or don't. Mother Darken, return to us. Mother Darken, return to us. Arbiter? What brings you to Haven? What's a Disciple doing here? Our holy priestess no longer needs your services. I'm a loyal servant! I can help her restore Darken to what it once was before... Before what? I don't blame you. I don't blame Clarity. There's no need to spill blood here. Go and gather the other Keepers. We will bring them all before Clarity, so they can air their grievances. We can be civil. I want to hear you out. So will Clarity. This... this is good. - This is good. - Thank you. It's all for the betterment of Darken. You have questions. It's good to have questions. Mother Darken, please return to us. Mother Darken, please return to us. Mother Darken, please return to us. Mother Darken, please return to us! Mother Darken, PLEASE RETURN TO US! MOTHER DARKEN, PLEASE RETURN TO US! - No. - Why not? Fine. We must keep moving. Do you hear anything? Go! AAAAH! NOOO! NOOO! No! No! - That's OK, honey. - You're fine, come on. - Come on! - Come on. Come on, let go. Aaah! Shit! OK, OK. OK, come on. Come on, Mercy. OK. - What is that? - Mother's blood. It sustains us. We need to move her. Where? - Haven. - No. She's not safe here. We need to move her now. - Now! - OK. Come on! Come on, Mercy. Something's wrong. What happened here? Mother Darken abandoned us. This is a warning. We need to get her inside. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. Shhh. Shhh. She's getting worse. She's lost too much blood, Kali. No! No. No. Mother's blood will heal her. Hey, listen to my voice. You will survive. It's gonna be OK. No. Don't! No. Stay with me. It's going to be fine. Don't leave me. No. No. Stay with me. She was my sister! And I failed to protect her. Is it done? Haven is no longer safe for the Exiles. For anyone in fact. What is it? I won't ask you again. I have reservations, my priestess. I worry that the loyal people of Darken will no longer have a place to feel safe. They will be safe everywhere once the Exiles are gone. And Mother Darken is back. At every turn, my people disobey me. Why are they afraid of me? I know, at times, I've had to punish them, - but it was necessary. - They will understand once Mother has come back. Don't you get it? I want them to love me as they love her. Anything less is an insult to me. - He's dead. - Another Disciple lost. Speak. I've seen her, the outsider, heading into Haven. Mother is so angry with us. I thought you said it was no longer safe. This is where the Keepers were, where they prayed to Mother. My prayers are done. The Keepers betrayed us. Mercy and I weren't Exiles. We didn't want to leave Darken. We just spoke against Clarity and how she hurts our people. That's when... they made the Disciples take Mercy's voice. So Clarity would favour them. I hope they're all dead. Mercy didn't die in vain, Kali. She signed something to you. What does that mean? Mercy had hope. I don't know if I do. ?? Mother Darken, hear my prayer. ? The doors open, you are there ? ? Mother Darken, let me in ?? Let me in! Ralston. Hold your ground. Easy there. - Don't hurt me. - Hmmmmm... It's me... Kali. Kali... I thought you were dead. Nearly. You didn't come back for me. You didn't come back for me. You and Mercy abandoned me to die. We had no choice. Hmmm, who's she? Ralston helped us to escape. He knows Darken. So it's you... the one Clarity is after. What happened here? They slaughtered the Keeper. He was loyal to Mother, and they slaughtered the Keeper, so I... pfff! Did you see them do it? Back. What did you do? I hid. I hid from them. I mean, I heard the screams. I mean, Kali, what was I supposed to do? They shouldn't be here, hm? Why did they come? For us. We're being hunted. Shhh... Get away from her! It's him! The Disciple killed the Keeper. No, it isn't! I'm gonna put this down. The Disciples killed her, didn't they? I'm here to help. He violated this place, he slaughtered the Keeper. - No, I didn't. - No, I didn't. Clarity must be stopped. I'm on your side. Lies! Lies! You can't trust a killer. - Kill him! Kill him please! - Why would I unarm myself? - I was saying a prayer for her. - Don't speak - about... - No! Listen to him. How can we trust you? It's you. You're the one I've been looking for. Please, have you seen her? Have you seen my Karisse? You're Taro? A woman dressed like you, - she said a poem. - Mother Darken, hear my prayer. The doors open and you are there. Yeah. That's it. The incantation is what Mother Darken used to bring lost souls here. We had forgotten. But some of us remember now. Can you get us out? Yes. Ah! Get back inside! You did it. You brought him here! What? Why are they still doing that? They know we're here. So we don't leave. I guess we're not going to solve this with words. Choose. Shells? Do you remember anything from before? There's this whole other world out there waiting for us. And it's better? It's different. West. Awww... I know they'll kill you soon enough. You're wrong about me. - I can help you. - Shhh... Not so fun being helpless, is it? Why have you disturbed me? Oh, uh... My apologies. I... I only wanted to tell you that the Exiles have barricaded themselves in the temple. Then get them out. It's not that easy. The doors are stout. Umm... And what? And they have Taro. Karisse... I should have known. Come, sit. Have you thought, Martin, what if Mother doesn't return? No, she will. She must. But if she doesn't. I'll need you to trust me, to do everything I ask so that we can be rid of these Exiles once and for all. Do you remember what it was like before Darken? No. No. I can tell when you're lying to me, Martin. Before Mother left us, we were blessed, we didn't have to remember. Now, we're starting to. Do you remember? Do you want this to happen again? No. You have been very cautious, Martin, and I know that Mother appreciates it. But now, we have much work to do. What do you remember from before, priestess? Nothing. Are you alright? When I entered Darken, there was a boy in a school room. He said it was his room. What was yours? I don't remember. Yes, you do. Kali, please... ...tell me. It was... small and dark. What was in it? Clothes, shoes. A closet? I hid. I was safe there. I was safe here. Who did you hide from? Father. He hurt me. I remember. Are we all just damaged people in here? They're coming. Ah! - Why are you here? - To kill Clarity. She should die for defying the words of Mother Darken. And she will die for killing my Karisse. Now, untie me! - Do it! - No! He's a Disciple; he can't be trusted. Kill him! Enough! Please forgive me, Mother Darken. Do it. Taro, can you get us out of here? Clarity has Mother's key, it will open - the door to the outside. - Can you get us to her? Of course. We just need to figure out how to get out of here. There's another way out. What is it?! Why didn't you tell us?! I was too scared to leave. I'm sorry, Kali. I'm sorry. Let's go. This way. What are you waiting for? Here? Where does this lead? Jail? It was someone's room once. Why are all these things here? Clarity. Karisse found a picture of the outside here. She started to remember Mother's prayer, what it was like before Darken. But Clarity doesn't want you to remember. Because she would lose control of the people. Shhh! Let's go. Shhh. - They're close. - Get ready. Hey. - You scared me. - Good. What are you doing? Ohhh... Hahahaha! Bringing you to Clarity. I'm not gonna let Martin take the glory. I saw it all. Martin killed the Keeper in the temple. Even though he was loyal to Mother, it didn't matter. Everyone treated me like an insect, cockroach in this place. OK. Nobody really cares about me. I risked my life for Kali, but she and Mercy left me behind. They left me behind, forgot about me. Maybe she'll see me differently now. See, when I bring you to Clarity... ...Clarity will make me her new arbiter. Haha! They don't know this way to Clarity. Let go of me! Stop this! Stop! Shame! Another Disciple betrays Mother Darken. Shame! I didn't betray Mother Darken, only that murderous snake, Clarity. Nice suit. What would you have me do with these traitors? Mother Darken would be honoured if we made an example - of them. - Yes, priestess. What a wonderful idea! The boy. No! No! Mother Darken thanks you. What are you doing with that boy? What are you doing here? I replenish Mother Darken. It's all I can do to help her. Mother Darken. Mother's blood. Yes. Our god, our life blood. It's sad. She doesn't produce anymore. Barely enough. Who is she? Haha! Ask anyone and you get a different answer. An angel cast from Heaven, a devil cast from Hell, a pagan god banished and searching for a new home. Everyone sees her through their own cracked lenses. What I do know is that Mother was a lost soul who feared and hated the world as such as we feared and hated the world. She created this place... and brought the lost souls with her. She created this place, so others would feel safe. Yes. Safe and provided for. But you... ...you're new here. How is that possible? This is your room. You're meant to replace me, I can see it in your eyes. This room is meant to be for you! Mother! Do not forsake me! I can still serve you! Please, do not cast me off! I'm not here to replace you. How was she burned? In a fire. Mother used to walk amongst her people. And then one day, she took the key and opened the door to where one of the lost souls were. When she returned, she was like this. I try to keep her alive, but she grows weaker every day. - Who brought her here? - Clarity. Do the others know? It is my burden alone. Your burns... ...the infection; this isn't from fire. It's a chemical burn. Who did this to you? I wanna help you. Your people need your help. This was done on purpose. Clarity. She did this. She burned her with acid. She's dangerous. I never thought to question Clarity. I'm ashamed I believed her. We all did. There's not much time left. I will stay here and keep her alive as long as I can. Darken is one place of many, but when she dies, I have no idea where the doors lead. Go. GO! That way! Beg for forgiveness. No. Why don't you banish us like you did Karisse? Or maybe you know there's no death outside - after all. - Martin. Your poor Karisse... Oh, you couldn't save her. You don't want people knowing there's safety outside... ...because they'd leave you. Then who would you rule? You don't fear death, do you? Mercy is dead, I don't fear much now. You felt the burn of acid before. If you kill me, someone else will rise up against you. - LEAVE HER! - Tell me where the outsider is. Where is she? Tell me now! I'm right here. I've seen Mother Darken. She's dying. She never left you; Clarity burned her with acid. That's why she's been gone. Mother would never turn you against each other like this. We have to leave this place or everyone will die. You all have to face it: Mother is dying, and this place is dying with her. Lies. Clearly, the Exiles have gotten to her. There's no saving her now. Kill her! No! You did this. You wanted to replace Mother, so you imprisoned her, but what you didn't realize is you were destroying - this whole world. - No. As long as I live, this place lives. I. Am. Darken. No. No, you cannot say that! Traitor. Ah! People love me more than they love Mother Darken. I have been keeping them here, protecting them. They are not going anywhere. No. No, no, no, no. No, this cannot be. You are bleeding Mother's blood?! Mother's blood?! Stop! Why? Why?! Why did you lie? I trusted you. The people, they never loved you, because you do not love them. You... you may let them go. Mother has died. Mother Darken, please return to us. We need to go. Now! If we don't follow her, we die! Come on. It's OK. I will stay and find more citizens. Darken is just one place among many. What is this place? I don't know. Let's go find out. Subrip by DanDee ?? We're self defined ? ?
