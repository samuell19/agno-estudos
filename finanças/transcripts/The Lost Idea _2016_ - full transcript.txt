Yesterday I was telling you about the history of our land It struck me that... I haven't explained you what history means and why it is so important for us As you might know history is the exploration of the past but that doesn't mean it has no relevance to the present When you study history, you go through the happenings of the past and gather some experience It is that experience which helps you frame the future I'll say... history is very much there... everywhere We are nothing but reflections of history History is beyond emperors and emperorship, beyond battles, architecture and renaissance History is a search of our own roots Every moment gone by is a part of history We are nothing but floating entities in an endless ocean To attach an identity to our existence, we need to place ourselves in the historical time-frame Hey British!

You're too possessive I'm a free spirit What am I hearing? What? Why are there gossips about you? What gossips? People near the club were saying... you were flirting with a young girl Is that true? Are you mad? Do I have the age for all these? I don't trust you And... why did you start painting at this age? Just like that... for my satisfaction I am afraid that you might become an artist one day What is there to be afraid of? Artists are not criminals I don't want you to be an artist Why? Artists are characterless What? Characterless? How can you say that? Listen, artists create characters. Ok? Don't say such silly things Everyone knows... Artists get attracted to many girls Ah... artists are broad-minded that's why I don't want you to be broad-minded Strange What most people say can't be wrong Ah... most people in our country are ignorants Ignore them! My father also says so So he is also an ignorant? Oh, your father also says so? Strange! So my father is an ignorant That's what you mean, isn't it? No no... not exactly... but... Strange From today, cook your own food otherwise, keep starving Strange Brother, were you able to paint? Yes Was it a strong evidence?

I just lost my dream Don't cry Dreams perish every moment, so that new dreams are born I'll never see my dream again Look at me, I'm your new dream [Hums a spiritual song] Hey brother Hello! What's the time? 8:10 8:10 We must not forget the purpose of education The purpose of education is not just ensuring a lavish lifestyle Education must open your eyes Education helps you see beyond what your eyes see The true power of mankind lies in their education, not in their weapons Education makes you liberal, tolerant and peaceful Education should not only enable you to answer questions, it should also enable you to raise them Yes, an educated mind must raise questions Blind faith is not education! Dumb obedience is not education! Even after getting educated, if you are unable to question your own conditioning, what's the use of such education? Hey listen, listen... wait for a minute I have something to ask What? Hey... that guy... British... I'm curious about his letters No no, it's a secret crazy fellow just forget that Hey listen, I won't tell anyone I swear... I won't disclose Why are you scared? I... I promise I'll keep it secret Ok What do you want to know? Can we open a bottle? Do you have some time to spare? Why should I tell you my secrets? What's the problem? You know I'm mad, Even if I say, will people believe me? There's no reason to be hesitant you can say go ahead You are a clever mad fellow! But I feel... you're a good human being That's why I'm saying, ok? British... British thinks that his girlfriend is married and she lives in London Oh, he thinks so? Yes... it may not be true He also thinks that... ... he writes great poems in English, and he wants to send the poems to his girlfriend in London to get them published in some English magazines Oh... I see Ok, but... how did you know all these? Liquor! Liquor is a strange blessing to mankind Hmm understood So you are taking advantage of his dreams Exactly! No... it's unethical, completely unethical Not at all I also give him money every three months saying that the money comes from London Oh... wow You have brains I must admit you have brains for sure Wow! Ok, tell me something... If you give him the money back, what is your profit then? I collect one poem every month and 250 rupees each time Every three-four months, I give him 400-500 rupees Not the same amount every time So he thinks that all his poems are not equally sellable This fluctuation in returns convinces him that the money genuinely comes... ... from the London based magazines Oh great You are a... ... very smart businessman You know how to cheat people No, I'm not cheating him I'm helping him What help? I keep his dreams alive That keeps him hopeful What's there in a life without dreams? He aspires... ... to become a great poet one day The whole world will know him, the whole world! He hopes his girlfriend will come back to him one day, at least... she would give him a call And with these dreams, he goes to sleep and he wakes up with a lot of hope Yes, it's true that... ... I cheat him to make some profit, but I also give him a purpose to live Ok, tell me, you crazy fellow, is it a bad deal? For the first time in my life, it feels that... ... even a cheat is doing something good So tell me bro, how is my Idea? Your Idea... Your Idea is fantastic! [Splashing sound] So, your Idea let you down? No, she gave me a chance to build a new dream Don't you have anything else to think about? My thoughts revolve around you, my dreams, and my Idea You still consider her to be your Idea? Hopes never die Why are you thinking of selling your land? How do you know? I can read your mind I don't have any income It's true that you send me the money every three months, but you know Shree, I spend much more in sending you the poems I know that You know that? Yes, I know Why don't you teach the young children here? You'll love teaching, and you'll also earn well What will I teach them? Teach them how to dream And you think they will pay me for that? Nowadays parents are only bothered about their children's result Only the score, nothing else matters If you were a father, would you have thought differently? Of course! There's a lot beyond the syllabus I would take my son to the sea and the mountain, I would show him the open sky, the morning Sun, make him feel the fresh air, I would let him get drenched in the monsoon rain, play in the mud, and roll on the sand, I would show him the real nature, and he would be a dreamer like me What if it's a 'she'? I would leave it upto you You're a bad father No, I'll just give you a chance to be a good mother Strange dreams! Shree, will you marry me? A bad question to ask! How far? We are almost there Hey look Don't they look like us? Oh my God! They look exactly like us! Should I wake them up? Are they asleep? Not sure Don't call them, I'm feeling scared Why? They look so lifeless Don't say like that My legs are paining, take me home Come [Hums a philosophical song] Hello! Hey brother What's the time?

Is he normal? The Sun hasn't risen for three days Is this normal? Hey! Someone is coming... isn't he the mad man? Hey you, mad fellow Listen! We heard that you've caught the Sun? So, you heard... ... that I've caught the Sun? But I haven't spread this good news yet How did you hear it? Stop your nonsense! You know why the Sun isn't rising Yes, I know The Sun will never rise again So, the Sun will never rise, and it will never set You Mothe... Shut up, shut up! Don't use cuss words! The Sun... The Sun is with me Where? Here! In my bag! Hey, stop, stop! You'll burn your hands Do you know... The Sun is... ... a ball of fire If you touch, you'll be burnt You can't touch it How are you keeping it then? I have caught it so I'll be able to keep it But you can't take it Ok so you set it free yourself Until my... Until my son returns, I can't set the Sun free Your son died long back Shut up! Shut up, you rascal! The Sun is not your paternal property Set it free! No! I won't set it free I won't! You can't make our world dark You bloody old... Shut up! Shut up right now! You!

Let me make it clear, You can't set the Sun free as long as I'm alive Ok, then get ready to die I don't care! [Punches, blows and groans] Oh... he might die The Sun won't rise till he dies He must die! The Sun is back! It's morning! May his soul rest in peace Fate! Now I know you! But it's a little too late! So, you couldn't find your Idea? No sir Sir, I kept waiting for her May be, she was lost in the darkness Oh, so you were waiting for her? You couldn't move your lazy body to search for her? Sir I went searching for her But it was of no use! Both of you are... worthless! Sir, I don't know where she is Please give us little more time No! I'll give my verdict today! Ok, tell me how does she look like? Beautiful Curly long hair Deep eyes Great figure What else? She is always in traditional attires I know the one you're searching for She is waiting there Hey, stop, listen! Listen! Stop! Stop! Keep searching for her She is no one's property Idea is just an inspiration! I brought you here to say a few words Why allow 'Fate' to decide? You're the master of your own fate Who are you? I am your realization Who knows how longer shall I live? Hey stop! Stop! Why are you running after the same Idea? Can't you find a new Idea? Hey! What are you doing? Let me go! Sir, this is our new Idea Hey listen, don't do this Please help me Why should we help you? You help yourself Find a new Idea Hey, something is tickling on my tummy What is it? Crab Crab?
