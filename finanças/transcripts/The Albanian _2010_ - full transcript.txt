Border checkpoint to Albania (Greek) Open up the back! My boss has the key... Open up! I can't. Get out of the back! Move! Get out! Albanian fucker! (Albanian) Poor guys... No money for visas. (Greek) Safe trip back home. The Albanian Papa! Bring the herd up. Did you bring me something with? First come home. Hello Grandpa. How's the hip? Kiss my ass! Beni, do you have my tape? Don't annoy me with your bloody tape. Ilir, turn that crap off! It wasn't right that he went along He has to work or there's not enough. Ilir, turn that shit off! He may go to high school and we don't let him. The high school is in Bajram Curri. Is he going to walk there every day? How much did you earn? 1000 per person. Minus 1200 for visas... ...which leaves 2500 Euro. Shit! For two months of work! It tasted good. I'm off to town. This late? Why are we stopping here? This way leads to the Petriti! Come on. Ben! Where are you taking us? I thought we're going to town... We are. Throw this if someone comes. Hey Ben, I can hardly walk! Just throw the stone! Why is the dog barking so? I'll go check. Since when are you back? Two weeks. What? Two weeks? Less then two hours! I couldn't wait to see you. I've really missed you this time. Don't they have girls in Greece? All fat and dumb. Too much Moussaka. Moussaka? Fatty Greek food. Beni, I have to tell you something. My parents took me off school. But why? Your grades were good... Someone's coming. Tomorrow on the meadow... ...ten o'clock Why did you throw the stone? I thought there was someone. Moron. Hello. lf you say something, you're dead. You too. What a hot car! BMW. In such a car Tupac has been shot. Bullshit! Tupac had a V12... ...this is just a 3series. Who got shot where? You don't know him anyway. Who's the guy? The west coast rapper of America! Hey boys! Hands off! Let me go for a spin, man. Is that your brother? He shouldn't touch my car. Nothing will happen to your car. Greece is a shitty place to work, isn't it? Sure. You earn 500 and pay 300 for the visa. I used to be in Germany. In Leverkusen. I've earned ten times more. And what have you done? Mechanic. Did you have a visa? Yes. But you can also go without... ...you should just not get caught. Sali knows. Shall we ask him? No, what for? Why not? No need. Beni, there's problems. Because of school? My father has debts. He borrowed money for the truck. ...I have to marry someone else. That's why I can't go to school anymore. He's an acquaintance of my uncle. He lives in America. He has a construction company. Now they want me to go there. To America? He'll pay my father's debts... ...as a wedding gift. And your mother? What does she say? That those are the rules. ...and for her it was the same. Six weeks later Have you been waiting long? - A bit. And, how was school? Did you know that Albania is the poorest country in Europe? ...and of all places, we have to live here. At least it's better than Greece. Soon I may stay in town during the week. They have a dorm for students from the mountains Really? Explain that to Dad. What does it cost? Nothing. How 'nothing'? Because I'm so intelligent... Are you Arben Shehu? Did you make my sister pregnant? Kids out. Ilir, you too. You can't marry her. Why not? They want 10.000 Euro. ...but the baby...? This baby has no lucky star. What does that mean? Arben, you're not stupid. Find yourself a decent wife. She fucked with you before marriage. A bitch in heat. Grandfather, you don't even know her! ...and Father, you're against this wedding! - I don't have 10.000! I'll find the money. - Arben, be reasonable. No, Father! Not this time! Germany... Why Germany? Why not Italy? Do you speak German? No. But I don't speak Italian either. You know the price for a German visa? Two thousand euro. Very expensive. And without a visa...? Without a visa... Do you know the Petriti clan? The daughter is having his child. When do you want to start? As soon as possible. It'll cost 500 euro. I'll lend you 300. I'm scared, Ilir. I can look after her, if you want me to. lf something's up, I'll let you know. I'll call you. Is it true? So that's it with America... Beni, they're imprisoning me. I can't handle it anymore! Let's run away. Somewhere they won't find us. That's not possible. - Why not? Think about the baby. You'll come as my bride to my family. I just have to earn the money. I can't go on like this. I'll go to Germany. I'll find work there. I'll be back in a few months. How wonderful that you came today. I promise you I'll be back before you give birth. Please don't leave me alone here. Never. Here I am. Where were you? You have to stay by the house. I went for a pee. Don't we have a toilet? Go inside! ...to need... I help? You? I good work. Need work. ...good... I help? ...help So... ...Sali lent you the money. And then? He sent me to Durres. ...the speedboat-guys are his friends. From Italy to Germany, I walked most of it. Sali gave me your number. ''When you're in Berlin, he'll help you.'' Did he say that? Come on inside, Arben. It's my friends house. He's a businessman. Really? Maybe he has a job for me. I can even do construction. He's into something else, Arben. Come, I show you where the bathroom is. Come along. ...wait a second... Edon, don't you say hello? - Hello! This is a friend of mine from Albania. ...his name is Arben. He's been on the road for one month... ...could he stay here for a few nights? ...sure. I'll show him where to wash up.

You want to shave? So, see you later. Thank you. Edon? ...where is Holger? At work. Hey Edon, what's up with you and Holger? Holger is my only chance. My visa expired. I've got no papers, just like you. I don't want to go back to Albania How exactly does he help you then? He's going to marry me. Why don't you marry a woman? Want more coffee? No. I've had enough. Maybe I know of a job for you. For a start... Three euro per hour. Three euro... That's not much. What do you expect? He has no papers. Can you imagine the risk I take? You used to get the same per hour. You'll be here each morning at six. Sometimes there's work, sometimes not. Ok. Not problem. I have to go back in. Better than nothing. No, it's perfect! Did he say six o'clock? Arben... I have to tell you something. You can't stay with us anymore. Holger doesn't want it any longer. Take this. It's from Holger. It's not my house. Am I speaking to Asim Vokshi Gymnasium in Bajram Curri? Yes. This is the high school. I am Ilir Shehu's elder brother. He's in the first year. Ilir Shehu... Yes, I know him. I'm calling from Germany.

I've been trying to reach you... How is it? I'm fine... yeah, could be better... Tell them I can't come. I won't make it. Arben... ...I'm in Germany. What? In Germany? I'm in Berlin. I have problems. Can we meet? Of course. Where in Berlin? Talk to the guys here... You're all right? Did someone touch you? - No, no. What's the problem with them? They want two hundred Euro or they cut off our balls. Do you have two hundred? I've sent everything to Albania. Can you run? And Gjoni? Forget Gjoni. Come! I have to go back. I can't leave Gjoni alone. Who's this Gjoni? ...a school friend. He has a brother in Berlin. What are you doing here? Well... Maybe Gjoni's brother has a job for us. Besides, he has a recording studio. What kind of work? What's with school, weirdo? ...or did you quit? Do they know at home? You idiot... ...why didn't you call me? I wanted to... ...but? What's wrong, Ilir? How did you get here? Beni, I must go back to Gjoni... Ah, they will let him go. With which money did you come here? ...and if something happens to him? - Forget that! Tell me what's up! What happened, Ilir? Where's the money from? ...did you see Etleva? They took her away... Who did? Where is she? The child... What do you babble about? ...they thought you weren't coming. Who thought that? - Arben, please... You knew I was coming! They wanted no fatherless child... Why didn't you call, idiot! - You're hurting me! Why don't you call your brother? Ben, let go of me! Ilir, you fucker... ...you knew I was coming back... ...why didn't you tell them? Shall we call the cops? No, no... He's my brother. No police. Shall I call the police? Where have you been? My brother... ...I meet my brother. Hi. How are you? ...better? What's wrong? I'll be right there, OK? The car's in a towing zone. Can this go? Goodbye. So what do you want to do now?. Where's my boat? It's in the forest. Why? Must bring people over again. I need the money. But Damir is dead... I know, but I need the money! We two can do it. Arben, just go without the money. You must see your girl. No! You don't understand! I can't go without money to Albania! I must go with money! I made a promise. Do you understand? With Etleva it's not like Nicola. It is not marrying for papers! Shit! Please help me! I can't help you. You're my friend, you must! Here, I can't. Then away you. Go to Nicola! Asshole! Parcel delivery service. Mister Shehu? Cash on delivery. 46.90 in all. 'Shopping channel... Baby Centre?' Did you order that? ...yes. Drive on! Have a look, it's Beni! My boy! Where are you going? - Home. Let's get Etleva. It's late. Let's go tomorrow. I've got the money. We go get her now. What's with your eye? Nothing... Let's go! Tomorrow, son! Something wrong with your ears? Well. Then I pick you up tomorrow. Hey Ben, how's everything? ...everything OK. Made some money in Germany, eh? ...and a nice car. Bravo, bravo. Where is Sali? He'll be back in half an hour. Little Arben! ...you're back? I brought your money. Your father paid everything. And did he cover the interest? Keep your money. Tell me, how was Germany? Fine... ...the job was fine. Everything was fine. Didn't you plan to return earlier? I'm just in time. And your bride-to-be? Aren't they waiting for you? Tomorrow I'll put things straight. I'll bring her home. Good. Welcome. - Thank you. How are you? - Fine. How is the family? - Fine. ...the sons? - Fine, thank you. Welcome. - Thank you. How is your father? - Fine. ...the sons? - They're all fine, thank you. Welcome. - Thank you. How is the family? - Fine. And yours? Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. You know why we're here? - I know. Here's the money. I see your honourable intentions... ...but it's too late. There will be no wedding. Take your money back. I don't have a daughter anymore. Where is she? What happened? We're guests here! Excuse him... He's been abroad for a long time. He has forgotten our customs. Arben! Etleva wanted to keep the child... But here, a child can't be without a father. Her father rejected her. Where is she now?. She's in the house of a doctor in Tirana. His name is Kol Topi. Kol Topi in Tirana. You should have come earlier. I know. Good day. Does Etleva Petriti live here? Is that her child? Is this the house of Dr. Kol Topi? He's mute. He won't answer. How are you? Fine. ...do they treat you well? What's the baby's name? Where the hell have you been? Why weren't you there at birth? You promised me. I know, but I had to earn the money. You promised! ...the money for the wedding... A wedding, just like everybody else has. They told me you won't come back. But I was hoping every day. They wanted no bastard in their house. So they brought me to Tirana... ...to take the child away after birth. I escaped, in order to keep the baby. But you weren't there. I got not a single message from you. I gave birth to a fatherless child. People called me a whore. I've stopped waiting. Please... Why did you come? What do you want? I'm not going back to the mountains. I don't want to go back either. I don't.
