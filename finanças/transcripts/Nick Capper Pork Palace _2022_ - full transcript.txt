- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Nick Capper. [audience applauds] - Hallooo [audience continue applauding] Hey guys, everyone have a good Christmas. [audience laughs] How good is Christmas? Huh? So good. My favorite thing about Christmas is eating a Ferrero Rocher how good are Ferrero Rochers. Ferrero Rochers more like Ferrero Oh yeah. [audience laughs] I still can't believe that gets a laugh. I sit down at my desk I try to write thought-provoking stuff and Ferrero Oh yeah gets a laugh? Gets a laugh every time. Ferrero Oh no. [audience laughs] You guys are kind of laughing about the Christmas bit because it's September, it's nine months after Christmas, but I'm filming this now. So someone could be watching this at Christmas and go on to get it. [audience laughs] So I shouldn't do that. Oh man. I don't know how this is going to go. I've never, I've never filmed anything before. You never know when stand up. How things are gonna go. You never know when your career is gonna end or when it's gonna begin. Never found out. Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes you see the weirdest stuff in standup. You just never know how it's gonna go. Once I saw a guy and he came out for like eight minutes and just didn't get one laugh for eight minutes. And then he went like this. He goes, that's it. It's this or Woolworths [audience laughs] I work at Woolworths and then still nobody laughed. And he's like, that's it. I'm gonna end it all. And everyone's like, Oh shit. [audience laughs] And he goes, yeah, I'm back in the game. Everyone's like, no. Anyway, that was hard gig for me. [audience laughs] That was me the whole time. Now I'm all right. I can do the job. Any fans of pigs? I am. Love pigs, always loved pigs. Pigs have the intelligence of a three year old child. You can look into a pig's eyes and it knows what you thinking. How many times have you guys looked into a pig's eyes and just look back at you and gone, yeah. Porn Hub. [audience laughs] Everybody, right? I'm in a moral conundrum with pigs because so smart. So beautiful yet. So delicious. There was this place in Sydney called the Forest Lodge Hotel and they had the best pork neck ever. And the pork neck was so good that I didn't call it the Forest Lodge Hotel. I called it Pork Palace. And every time I went there, I'd always sing this song. I'd always go. ♪ Pork Palace hand me and my chalice. Cause shit goes crazy ♪ ♪ When it get to Pork Palace. Pork Palace. ♪ [audience laughs] Girlfriend hated it. She was like, do we have to sing it in the restaurant? I said, yes, it's Pork Palace. She also hated it because I started singing it even when I wasn't at Pork Palace. Just when I got excited in general, I'd be singing it wherever and be like. ♪ Pork Palace hand me and my chalice. Cause shit goes crazy ♪ ♪ When I get to Pork Palace. Pork Palace. ♪ And my girlfriend would be like, get off me. [audience laughs] She's like you promise you wouldn't sing it mid coitus. I'm like sorry baby. I was excited. This is, Oh, this is so good. It's so good. That, that, Oh, Oh, it's good you rocked up NASA. Great. I'm just taping something here. I put like $3,000 Into this. Anyway. It's good. It's good to hear. Anyway. As I was saying about, anyway, as I was saying about white power. [audience laughs] I think we all got to stick together. No, I'm just kidding mate. That's that's after the show. No, this gigs great. Love it. You don't get to do many good gigs when you do standup. Some sometimes you get, no, you don't. Sometimes you have to do the worst gigs. I got sent an email a couple of months ago and a guy said, Hey Nick, how would you like a job in stand up comedy? I said sweet. Started rubbing my hands together at the hundreds of dollars I could be making per year. I said, yeah, lay it on me, bro. What's this cool job? And he's like, he says, Nick, it is the best idea ever. How would you like to perform in between strippers? I'm like Oh yeah man. That is the best idea ever. Picture this right? You're, you're someone at the strippers and there's a nude woman dancing in front of you. You are aroused. You're rock hard. And you go, ah, tell you what to make this night better. A laugh. [audience laughs] No one said that ever. In fact, probably the main reason you're in a strip club is because there's been enough laughter in the vicinity of your erection. [audience laughs] No one's taken your erection seriously, except for you when you get home. What if, what if I performed at your local strip club and you've been there for like the whole weekend you've been having a mad, really made a holiday out of it. And you go into work on Monday and you're at the, the meeting room. The, the, the water cooler. I dunno. I've never worked. Imagine putting this in front of a desk. They're like, Oh no, it wasn't full of semen. [audience laughs] Yeah, but what if you were in the water cooler thing and you say, Hey Barry, what did you do on a weekend? And you're like, ah, not much went mountain biking. What did you do? And you go, Oh, I went to the strippers all weekend. They're like Aw. That's a bit weird. Isn't it? No, it was different this time. It was a nude woman dancing in front of me. I was aroused. Although I was gonna send this rocket into the stratosphere, just when I thought the night couldn't get any better, the nude woman walks off and then in walks a 36 year old man with scoliosis and a poor man's Napoleon dynamite haircut. And then starts talking about Woolworths. [audience laughs] Shit I gotta pick this gig up. It's going down faster than a Paragon Falcon. The fastest bird in the world. Yeah. I don't know why I put this hay on the stage. I thought, Oh, well I'm a country, man. You know? But yeah. Well, well while everyone else is saying goodbye, I'm gonna be vacuuming. Like when you're at my level, you clean your own props. Also I bought a shovel, but I left a tag on so [indistinct] [audience laughs] You guys must be looking at me right now going, Oh, bloody hell. Isn't this bloke a weapon. And you're right. I am a weapon, because lately I've been taking classes in Brazilian jujitsu. I've taken four classes, four. So if I was coming back from the gig tonight and then some dude jumped out with a knife and he said, Hey Nick, well he wouldn't know my name. [audience applauds] If he did, I'd be like, Oh, here's the wallet, good background research. [audience laughs] I'm a hard man to follow. Sometimes I'll walk really fast. But if he If he pulled out the knife and said, Hey mate, give me a wallet. I'd be like, you idiot. Can't you see my weapon? I've taken four classes in Brazilian jujitsu four classes. He goes, alright mate, it's on. And then if he walked towards me and then put his feet exactly like this, leaned his head forward. Relaxed, his whole body. And then someone put a gym mat underneath I would destroy him. Absolutely destroy him. It must be working out because my girlfriend said this to me the other day. She said, Nick, I feel protected around you. And I said, huh, is that because I've been doing Brazilian jujitsu four classes? And she said, no it's cause you look like a weirdo. [audience laughs] And I'm like, how does that protect you? And she said, well, other weirdos see you walking with me and they think Ahh, leave her alone. One of us has got to her already. [audience laughs] So it's really working out for me. Actually, before we start tonight, we're pretty much into it, aren't we? Does anyone wanna heckle any heckles? - Why are you wearing a Canadian Tuxedo? - Why am I wearing a Canadian Tuxedo? Who are you an idiot? [audience laughs] Told you I was a weapon. To be honest. I didn't even know what was wearing one. If you heckle tonight, body hell, I will destroy you. I'll absolutely destroy. I'm a weapon. The other night I was killing this gig. Like as you can see from so far, blowing the roof off, it was going crazy. Girls are lifting up their shoes. Like their not shoes [audience laughs] Hey. High heels. Someone's getting lucky. Girls were lifting up their shirts. Blokes for asking for autographs. Jerry Seinfeld was giving me head. Although, I was like, Whoa, Jerry, not mid set. No, I was destroying this gig. Absolutely blowing the roof off. And then this it, Oh, and I should tell you that I was wearing a John Deere shirt. Okay. Cause John Deere is my favorite brand of tractor. If you haven't got a favorite brand of tractor, get on board. It's how I tell if you're in-bred or not. Massey Ferguson owners am I right. [audience laughs] I was killing this gig and this bloke decides he wants to heckle. He goes, ah, excuse me, sir. I'd like to heckle. And I'm like, step into the flames idiot. I've been doing this for 10 years. Believe it or not. Said what's your heckle. And this was his Heckle, right? He said, John Deere is a shit brand of tractor. What a better brand of tractor is, is the Steiger Road Track. And I'm like you idiot. As we all know, Steiger Road Track uses tracks. Okay. That's more compaction on the soil, especially when you row crop cropping. Okay? When you have more compaction on the soil, nothing grows there and the water flows down the wheel tracks a lot faster. And the soil doesn't absorb the water. John Deere uses tires. That's less compaction on the soil and it creates a better, better wheel track. And the water flows less and it doesn't destroy your heels [audience laughs] So therefore you have better yields. It was at this point. Sorry. - [Man In The Audience] You truly are agricultural. - Yes. I don't know what to say to that heckle. That's like saying you're funny. And I'm like, I know. Yeah, that's good. That's like some guy who did you rock up thinking this wasn't going to be agriculture. And you're like, Hey, he wasn't lying. Usually it's a gimmick. At this point he knew he'd been defeated. Okay. So then he tries to come back at me with another heckle. He says, yeah, but the John Deere doesn't even have a handbrake. I said, exactly, it's got power shift. Okay. If you want to put it in the park, you just put it in with your thumb. As we all know, there's nothing worse than when you're spraying, when you're ploughing and you keep getting blocked by is a block spray nozzles. And you've got a hand brake in the track and you've gotta keep pulling it off and on to get in and out of the cab. [audience laughs] So then he tries to come back at me again, but this time he's trying to be my friend, you know? Cause you know, when you've been destroyed by a comedian/male model. [audience laughs] And this was he's heckled, he goes, well, if the John Deere doesn't have a hand brake, how are you going to do a hand brake turn? And I said, mate, the top speed of a tractor is 38 kilometers an hour. Good luck doing a handbrake turn at that speed. So if you want to heckle tonight, it's your funeral. [audience applauds] Thank you. That was good. Shit I've gotta pick this gig up. It's going damn faster than Louisiana snapping turtle, the fastest turtle in the world. At this point in the show, you must be thinking, wow. I wonder what this guy knows about politics and and look guys, I don't want to bring the show down. I don't want to bring the mood down. Okay. Like I don't want to get too political. You guys came here for a good time, but I've got to say I am pretty scared of our current political situation. I'm scared that there's gonna be another war and they're gonna bring back conscription. Like mandatory service. Are any guys scared of that? Are you scared of that, man? Yeah. I'd be scared if I was you. You're a pretty fit guy. If I was as a Colonel, I would draft you straight away. Like think of me. I'm ripped. I would go straight into special forces and I'll probably be driving a tank, due to my agricultural background. He knows his way around a tractor throwing him in a Panzer. I dunno why I said Panzer that way. All German tank. Yeah. I'm with you man. I'm scared. I'm scared of conscription. Like the other day I was having a 69. And I was thinking about conscription cause I was bored. [audience laughs] Because as we can all agree, 69 is pretty overrated. Your half concentrating on your stuff and then your half concentrating on their stuff. Who's ever been in a 69 or, and gone. Oh yeah. What a win win situation. No one. Okay. And there's no reason to doing at the same time. You go, Oh yeah, it looks good on paper. Cool. It's like riding your favorite roller coaster while eating your favorite ice cream. [audience laughs] But when you're actually doing that, you're like, this is actually quite confusing. Stuff going all over my face, came here for a good time. Like there's no reason to do that. Look, who's been getting head and gone. Oh yeah. I tell you what to make this better. Giving back. No one. It's not a time for charity. It's your time to think about stuff. And all the other positions make sense? You know, that the missionary one's good. It's an old classic. You can look in their eyes. Pretend their not going to get old. Or, not old already. The doggy style. One's good. If you're a fan of astronomy, you can do that outside, look at the stars. They've all got their uses. Yeah. The, I was having this 69 cause I have them all the time. And it's the only reason I do stand up. Is to give me a break from all the 69 coming my way. I thought what a useless position it is. But then I thought if I was conscripted into the war and let's say I was on the battlefield and one of my comrades had his legs blown off and I therefore had to escort him from the battlefield without hurting his leg wounds. Then I reckon the best way to carry him off, would be to turn him upside down, put my penis in his mouth. Put his penis in my mouth. And I'd have to suck really hard. So he doesn't fall off. And then you got two hands free for shooting. [audience laughs] You could be running through the battlefield just going brrr. Well, you wouldn't be doing that. You'd be going aaah. You'd be one of those skill tests at clans of death. Mate, uh, are you afraid of conscription now? [audience laughs] Guys, sorry to get political. Yeah as you can tell from my great things here. Yeah. I'm from the country. I'm a country, man. I'm from a town called Goondiwindi anyone been there? No, ah, you're all missing out. A lot of people I rag on towns like Goondiwindi saying they're backwards in bread holes, but Goondiwindi sometimes a town like that can be the forefront of technology. For example, they have a disused red rooster there and rather than knocking the building down, they have turned it into a drive through tobacconist. I wish that wasn't true. Which is good for me. Cause I've always wanted to get cancer, but the things that's annoyed me the most is getting in and out of my car. So I'm gonna move there. Also, Goondiwindi, got one of Australia's biggest roundabouts. It's great for me because it gives you time to think about whether you want to go into Goondiwindi or not. You just be like aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh. Oh. I drove through tobacconist. Hell yeah. I'm a bit of a bloody animal guys. I love the bloody party. I'm a real party animal. I'm crazy. I'm all over the place. Last year I went on a round the world trip with my parents, and my grandma cause I'm an animal. I just thought, Hey, who are the three maddest pricks I know? Till we can take it all over again. When you go on around the world trip with one of the people that gave birth to you. And one of the people that gave birth to one of them, that's what's known as a baboosh goodell of adventure. [audience laughs] we went on this boat trip from Amsterdam to Budapest. I don't know whether you guys have been on this boat trip, but when I went to go, they said, you're not getting on this boat. Are you? I said, yeah, I got a ticket. And they were like, Oh, you don't want to because you be the youngest person on this boat by about 40. Did someone bring a baby? [audience laughs] Someone brought a baby. This was going to be a liability. Oh no. Is it okay? I can give you time to take it outside if you want. Oh yeah. Why doesn't everyone bring their fucking babies here? Shut up. All right. I know what I meant is if you think it's going to be okay. Oh, okay, cool. Oh, I'll leave the baby in there. If anyone can bring more babies, that'd be great. Now that, I'm hating on babies, when I release this they're gonna go. Oh, everything was pretty on board. The 69 thing was cool. Then he started hating on babies. [audience laughs] Anyway, I'm burning this after we record it. When I went to get on the boat, they said, they said, you're gonna be the youngest person on this boat by about 40 years. And I said, that's cool. I know old people. I've seen Jurassic Park. But when I got on the boat and I saw everyone else getting on the boat, I thought, holy shit, these people are old. Right? People were getting wheeled onto the boat. People were hobbling onto the boat, a pretty serious or a call room with a bloke's head in it. Oh, holy shit. These people are all old. I'm gonna be the sole survivor of a boat that never sank. [audience laughs and applauds] I'm gonna get on the boat. And when I get to the amp, like to Budapest, they'd be like, how did you survive the bait great boat disaster of 2018. I'm like, well, I'm the only one, a board who doesn't know what a gramophone is. And I do know what a gramophone is. They do a great job on your hair. What else am I gonna? Oh shit. I better check my notes. Sorry guys. It's quite unprofessional of me. Oh no. There's no note in at all. There's photos of Ferrero Rocher. [audience laughs] Look at this. This one's a family pack. So what's happened when you have Prince Charles over Ooh. Oh, look at this. It's a Ferrero Rocher in the nude. That doesn't get your motor running I don't know what will. You guys must be thinking, wow, this is the best comedian I've ever seen. There's no way he has a day job, but sometimes I work in a cafe. And I think to myself, man, thank God I got comedy at the end of the shit job. I think I would've got comedy. And right now I'm standing in front of you guys. And I just spent $3,000 on filming this thing. And you guys are pretty confused as to what's going on. I just did a shit joke about Ferrero Rocher. Right now I'm thinking whoa thank God I've got a fucking job. Imagine doing this every night. I'd kill myself. No, I would. I am from the country, as I said before I'm from Goondiwindi and it's nice. I've been living in Melbourne, here in the city for about five years. I love it. I love coming to the city. But I think when you live in the city for so long, your priorities change like we get whatever we want here, 24/7. For example, I used to work in a cafe, as I said before. Cause everyone's got a passion and mine's retail. You get a bit of perspective into people's priorities in the city when you work at a cafe. Anyone here work at a cafe? No. Oh, Oh, we got a room full of ballers. Oh, dance for his little monkey. I drive home in my Lexo whatever you call it. I only call it a Lexo from Ice Cube songs. When you, when you're work in a cafe, you get a glimpse, like how great are customers. They are the best people in the world. How great are these customers at cafes? When they go, ah, excuse me, can I get half of the shot of the coffee and the bottom? And then can I get some cold milk? And then can I get the rest of the shot? And then can I get some hot milk on top of that? And I'm like, how fucked is your life that you care this much about coffee? Buy a puzzle. [audience laughs] I'm so proud of my parents. I'm so proud of my parents because they live an hour from the nearest cafe. So they've got different priorities. Like whenever I take them to a cafe, I say, what type of coffee would you like? And they say just coffee, just coffee. I'm so proud of them. Like, I could give them anything. I could give them mud. And they're like, Ooh, the city Do you know why they think of that stuff? Do you know why coffee Isn't on the top of their priority list? Cause they've got other shit to think about. Like my dad he's built a dam wherever we've lived. Four different houses, four different dams. One didn't even get water in it. It was just being optimistic. So whenever someone orders a weird coffee, I'm like, ah, this person's never built a dam. Here's a shovel. Start digging. Preferably fill it up while you're still in it. [audience laughs] Maybe with some cold water and some hot water, and some cold water and some hot water until you drown. [audience applauds] Also, I learned this from working in a cafe. If you're one of those people that likes to order soy milk, that's fine with me. I drink soy milk. I think it's great. But if you're one of those people that likes to order a soy milkshake, but still wants full fat ice cream in the soy milkshake. You're a fucking monster. You're the reason they should bring back the chair. I'll flick the switch. I will. You're the same person who brings babies into live tapings. [audience laughs] Just joking, just joking Oh no, their gone. I loved you baby. My comedy son or daughter. Sorry. I don't know. Yeah, but that's how I know my parents aren't into kinky sex. Come with me on this one. Cause you reckon kinks and fetishes started in first world countries. Cause in first world countries like the city, we have all types of options. We have whatever we want 24/7. So our priorities are a bit different. Like probably all you guys, work 45 hours a week behind a desk or in a construction site. So therefore you can buy whatever you want. Probably all of you rent a decent place. Probably own a nice place. Probably all of you have a decent car. Probably all of you, all of you have a big screen TV. So you go, okay, I've got all this stuff. I've got no worries. So the only way I'm going to orgasm now is if someone dresses in a squirrel suit, and sticks their fist up my ass. And that's cool. That's fine. If you're into that, like I'm crazy too. Like sometimes I eat the wrong side of the maxi bond first. I'm a wild man. But if, if you're in a third world country and you've been working hard all day, you don't know what are you gonna eat or not? You don't know what you're gonna come home to. And then when you come home and your partner says, Hey, how do you wanna have sex tonight? You'd be like, Oh, up just missionary. Thanks. I've got a lot on. I've got to build a dam in the morning. That's, that's how I know my parents don't do that stuff. And look, I would be fine if they did. I used to do a bit of kinky sex myself. I did a bit of bondage. I had a safe word actually. And that was please don't put anything in the eye of my dick [audience laughs] Work sometimes. And when it didn't work, I knew where my keys were. [audience laughs] I'm glad you guys liked that one. I'll tell you who didn't like it, a civil engineers conference in Freemantle. I was chased out of Fremantle with set squares. I was, I tried to recover the gig, give him some shit. I was like, what? You guys can build a bridge, plan a town but you can't handle a few keys in the dick. Man up. I gotta be honest with you. The gig did not get any better. Yeah. I was talking to a friend the other day about fetishes and things like that. And he said, Hey Nick, have you heard about this disgusting fetish called scat sex? And I said, Oh, I dunno. I dunno what it is, but it sounds cool. Like I'm, I'm liberal, you know, lay it on me bruh. And then he said, Oh, this isn't a maxi bond thing. This is a little wilder than that. And I said, what is it? What is it? I'm cool. Like I'm free. I'm crazy. And he said, when two people are having sex. And they, they like defecate on each other. They like Pooh on each other. And I said, Oh, I'm not into that. And he said, yeah in it. isn't it terrible? Isn't it disgusting? What a bad thing those couples do. And I said, hang on you and I, my thing is disgusting, but I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think it's a bad thing at all. That's just something what people do. And as we can all agree, couples are into worse things. Oh I used to work at JB Hi-Fi cause everyone's got a passion and mine's retail, And this is a true story. Once I saw a couple walk into JB Hi-Fi, and they went straight to the Top Gear section. Now for those who don't know, Top Gear is a very popular TV show about cars. And the lady went over to the Top Gear section and she pulled a Top Gear mug off the shelf. And she said to her husband, didn't you mention that you needed a new mug for work. And he liked okay. And then he said, Yeah, I did at one stage mention that I needed a new mug for work. And I do like Top Gear. This will be a suitable mug. [audience laughs] For me to take the work every day for the rest of my life, For him to be boring enough to say that. And for her to be boring enough to remember that he once said that. Wouldn't you just rather shit on each other. [audience laughs and applauds] If you remembering stuff that bland, you are dead already. Like, if I ever had a daughter, God forbid, and she, she said, Hey dad, this is my new partner. We've got a story for you. He mentioned he needed a new mag for work, and he likes Top Gear. I'll be like, stop it there. Here's a shovel, go build a dam. [audience laughs] Fill it up with you. Both in it. But if she said, Hey dad, I don't know why I'm telling you this. [audience laughs] But in order to orgasm, we like to shit on each other. I'd say, Oh good icebreaker. At least it's different. At least it's unique. It could be worse. You could put full fat ice cream into soy milkshakes. Or do 69. I reckon, I reckon if your kid told you that they're into scat sex, It'd be kind of like, if your kid told you, they'd just taken up the accordion. You have my full support. Just don't do it around me. It is disgusting. My dad. He used to give me good old country advice, you know? Like good old outback advice about things. You always said this saying, when it comes to meeting a partner, he said, Nick, when you want to meet a girl, remember this long wife, long life. [audience laughs] And I always had heeded to his advice. And like a long time later on my wedding day, my dad called me over and he said, Hey Nick, before we do the wedding is something I've got to tell you. I love you. I'm so proud of you. I love his girl you gonna marry. And I'm just so happy I raised a good bloke. But there's something I got to tell you. It's actually not long wife long life. It's actually happy wife, happy life. And I'm like argh fuck dad. You should've told me earlier. I'm about to marry the longest woman in the world. This woman was so long that when she wore roller skates, people thought she was a train. We'd be, we'd be rollerskating down at St. Kilda, people be trying to buy tickets to go on the country link to Albury. She was longer than the wingspan of a wondering albatross. The longest bird in the world. [audience applauds] How long is a piece of string? Who gives a fuck? It's not as long as my wife. She was longer than the home and away DVD box set. And that was with the commentary by an elf. Hey, there's people walking to a cafe. I don't know. I never watch it. Anyway. I had to divorce her. She was too long, but she's doing quite well for herself now she's been commissioned as a bridge. So good luck, Wendy Dachshund, I'll always love you. [audience laughs] I went to England recently. Loved England. Love it. And I bloody loved it. Going to England. I was so excited, although, wow. Like going to England, going to the Capital, London like London, so much history, so much culture. I wonder what I'll learn in London. I wonder how London will change me. I wonder what kind of man I'll come back as, once it come back from London. And upon leaving London, I thought, wow, how great is cocaine? [audience laughs] I didn't even see the sites. I was like, screw London Bridge and Buckingham Temple. I just wanna have a conversation with a complete stranger in a nightclub, toilet cubicle at 800 words per minute. I don't know who you are, bruh, but let's do Bitcoin. It's cool traveling. And it's cool. Like, like having a partner and stuff, you know, it's great. It's better than, you know, like being know single. Well, me being single anyway. I'm not good at it. When I'm, when I'm single. I just do weird stuff. One time I bought a flashlight. For those who don't know what a flashlight is, it's a torch with a fake vagina in the front of it. So it's the only object that accurately symbolizes the cross section between loneliness and camping. [audience laughs] I went to a, I think, I think, I think flashlight is kind of like a fondue set. You think it's going to be a great idea. And then you have one good time with it, put it in the cupboard. But then every time you open the cupboard from then on, it just gets more and more embarrassing until you go to throw it out. And then you think of the good time you had with it. And then you have sex with it again. [audience laughs] No one wants to borrow my phone fondue set. one skewer only thanks. Imagine buying a fondue set alone. And then the guy go and go to party coming up huh? And you're like, no. You would call a terrorist hotline straightaway. Shit I better pick this gig up. It's going down fast than I've got no more of those. [audience laughs] Sorry guys, just before I end this I'm gonna have a quick look over the notes. Oh no, aargh. These aren't my notes. Can you come? Can you come up here mate? Just for a second? Oh no. These are not my notes at all. It's just a drawing of my wife. [audience laughs and applauds] Good luck, Wendy Dachshund. I'll always love you. I tried to draw it on the back and yeah, my friend said, what is that? I was like, it's a long wife. And they said, that is an elongated wife. You can sit down now, give it up for this guy. [audience applauds] I don't know whether you got to sign some kind of form or something, but just don't sue me. Anyway. Yeah. So I'll, I'll end on this. I love traveling. I do. But traveling around England place like that doesn't really compare to the country. Like to the Australian outback where I'm from. I love it. I love the people and the people you meet out there are the best. And the country can even change your perspective on things. Like cause people in the country sometimes have different perspective than the people in the city. Like I was in Perth recently. Now I know what you're thinking. Nick, Perth, not the country. But I was crabbing in Perth. I was catching crabs out of the water in Perth. You can't do that in a city. You can't do that. You can't go crabbing in Melbourne or Sydney or not on purpose anyway. [audience laughs] Had a few odd nights fishing. I tell you that. Yeah. And before I tell you this story, I've got to say the bloke. I was crabbing with heart of gold, great guy's name was Tone. Love him. Love him to death. That one of the nicest guys I've ever met and just a great old friend, but I've gotta say, when you are crabbing with a man that he's over 50 from Perth, you're pretty much guaranteed at one point or another, he's going to say something fucked like that is a Venn diagram of one nation. I was crabbing with Tone and it'd been four hours. And he still had not said anything remotely bigoted, sexist or racist. And I was like, Whoa, this is a record. I sent an email to the Guinness book of records. I said, I am crabbing with a man over 50 from Perth still hasn't said anything fucked yet. And they replied back straight away. They said, this is the craziest shit we've ever heard of and we once saw a lizard man. Right? Try to hold him there. Maybe film it on your phone. We're going to have eight people fly out from Guinness. [audience laughs] To make sure we can see this great specimen. Anyway, we're having a great time. And I was crabbing with my shirt off. Cause if you're rocking a rig like this, you've got to advertise. If you got a Bentley, you know, keep it in the driveway. You keep it out on the road to make everyone horny. I was so I was crabbing with Tone and this crab tried to grab me on the nipples with its nippers. And I said to Tone, I said, fwaa look at this Randy bloke, trying to grab me on the nipples with its nippers. And then Tone kind of looked at me like, God, ah yeah. Now I can say it. He's given me the key to the door to fucked world. And then he said, this is honestly what he said. He said, Nick, do you know the best thing about having sex with another man is? I said fwaa lay it on me Tone. Always wanted to hear the perspectives on homosexuality from a heterosexual man that is over 50 from Perth who likes to go crabbing Where were you on Q and A? [audience laughs] And this is what he said. He said the best thing about having sex with another man is, is you can reach around, grab his penis. And it feels like yours has gone all the way through. [audience laughs] Now I dunno whether that's homophobic or not, but we all have to agree. That's odd. If you tell Salvador Dali, he'd be like flaa. Sacra bluer. Put some melted clocks over the shaft. And it changed my perspectives on homosexuality. I've never been attracted to men, but no one ever told me that It feels like having a real big dick. If someone told me that I'd be like, sign me up. And not only a big dick, a dick big enough to impale another human being. Like, forget about making love. Forget about pleasure. Forget about crabbing. I just want to go human spearfishing. [audience laughs] I call, I call the Guinness Book of Records said it's off. I said, yeah, we weren't holding out. Anyway. I must admit though, being there with Tone in the water, got me a bit excited. And I started singing it. ♪ Pork Palace hand me and my chalice.
