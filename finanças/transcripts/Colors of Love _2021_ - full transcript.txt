I think I found the problem. There's a discrepancy in the date of the land grant. - Discrepancy? - Yes. Captain Daniel Mass received a land grant of 300 acres in November 1721. But... Captain Mass was in England at the time. He didn't return to the colonies until 1723. Which means he couldn't have helped settle the region until two years after he was given the land! - Shh! - Given the land. Exactly. Because he wasn't even here. I don't know how to thank you, Taylor. This is the last piece of the puzzle. Now I can get back to my book. I have to call my publisher. Well, I'm happy to help, Dr. Sadler. Digging up history, it's what I love to do. Uh, be sure to send me a copy when it gets finished. Excuse me. It's like you have a sixth sense. Well, there's still some stuff that you can't find on the internet. Do you have a second to talk? Did you get my message? Yeah. I can't believe it. Why would they cut our library's funding like that? The city depends on grants to help meet our budget. When those grants dry up, the city has no choice. And without that funding... You can't afford a research librarian on staff. I'm sorry, Taylor. I'm already looking for other funding. The second I can bring you back, I... We're gonna miss you so much. Not as much as I'm going to miss you, Linda. Linda promised to try and find funding, but that could take months. I've called everyone I know, but nobody's hiring. - It's gonna be okay, sis. - Will it? That was my dream job, Craig. I know, and you were good at it, too, okay? But trust me, Taylor, you'll find another job before you know it. What do I do in the meantime? Hey, you know what? I got a good idea. Why don't you come down here and visit? Christine and I have plenty of room, you've never seen Forest Ridge, and it'll be a really nice change from the big city. I mean, that does sound nice, but I have to find another job. Well, you can keep looking while you're down here. And Zoe will be over the moon to spend some time with her aunt. Oh, I do miss her. So? What's stopping you? I'll think about it. - Ray, sorry I'm late. I got up early to help my dad. - Man, I still can't believe you grew up on a ranch in Montana. Oh, come on, man, my family in Forest Ridge go way back. My great-great-grandfather cleared the land for that ranch. Yeah, you told me, him and Daniel Boone. Look, it's just so far away from you busting sod to running a tech company in Silicon Valley. Oh, my phone. Come on, man, you gotta love this place, right? Every time I come here, it's like stepping back in time. Which is why it's costing so much money to bring it into the 21st century. Have you taken a good look at that electric panel? Yeah, did you talk to Lyle first - about doing the rewiring? - Yeah, about that. Your buddy's been keeping it a bit too high. Okay, well, I'm not sure I'd call him my buddy, but... He said you two have known each other since grade school. - Regardless, I hear he's a good electrician. - And I'm your business manager. Okay, I really appreciate this passion project of yours, but it's my job to watch the bottom line. I know, Ray, it just... it makes a lot of sense to hire as many locals as possible, you know? No. Not if it's gonna put us over budget. Okay, all right, you're right. - We'll get small bidders. - Oh, one last thing before I leave. Apparently, not everyone's too thrilled about turning the Graff Hotel into a luxury tourist attraction. I was worried about this. I mean, this could be good for the whole town. - Why would anyone wanna stop it? - Well, you can find out when you ask them at the meeting. - Wait, what? - One of us needs to be there. And you're the local boy made good. Sounds good, doesn't it? I'll call you! Hey, Dad. Hey there. I was gonna make some lunch. Wanna join me? - Yeah, sure. Let me give you a hand with that. - Hmm. I'm heading into Helena for some meetings. I'll be back tomorrow. Supposed to be a storm front moving in. Couple inches of snow. Dad, it's October. The leaves just started changing. - It's not gonna snow. - Wouldn't be the first time we were in for a surprise. There's a frost warning. You better watch the roads. - Could get icy out there. - I'll be fine. Yeah, all that time living in California, - you could be out of practice driving in it. - I'll be okay, all right? I promise. Hey, let me ask you something. Do you know anything about this town meeting tomorrow night? - Yeah, the one about the hotel? - Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? Well, I figured you knew about it. I mean, you grew up here, Joel. You know when people got something on their mind, - they're not shy about speaking up. - Yeah, that I do. So, what is it exactly on their mind? They barely see you around here anymore. Then one day you show up, say you're gonna turn one of the oldest establishments in town into some sort of fancy resort. It's not a resort. It's a... it's a destination. See? Right there. "Destination". What does that even mean? Oh, so, what are you saying, I got a bit of a PR problem? I'm saying you gotta talk straight to people if you wanna get 'em onboard. Look, why don't you take my truck? That little go-kart of yours isn't gonna be much good - if the weather turns. - Okay, Dad. You know what? I'll tell you what. I'll leave you the keys, you can take that little golden ride for a spin. Oh! Ooh. It's okay. It's just a... it's just a little ice. Ooh! Okay. Oh! No! Oh, man. This is great. Okay. Really? As if I wasn't having a hard enough day already. Hello? Oh, hi! Thank goodness. - You all right? - Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so. I think I must have hit a patch of black ice - and I thought I was gonna freeze out here. - Yeah. Thank you for stopping. You lose something? Oh, there it is! Yes! I don't suppose you have any reception out here? Uh, yeah, not out here. What I can do is I can offer you a ride, - if you'd like. - Uh... But you don't know me, so here's what I'm gonna do. Uh... I'll write my license plate down, as you can see, ...and my address... You can take this, put it on your dash, and, you know, if anyone comes looking for you, - they'll know where to find ya. - Well, that's very thoughtful of you. Thank you. Easy. So, uh, you know, before I do commit to this, - which way are you headed? - I'm actually heading to a small town called Forest Ridge. I know it well. Come on, let's get you out of the cold. - It's been quite the day. - I see that. Come on. I'm Taylor, by the way. Introductions. Forgot about that part. Uh, Joel. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, uh, wh... what brings you to Forest Ridge? Uh, my big brother lives here with his family. I've actually never been here before. Well, I might be slightly biased, being that I'm, well, from here, but... there's no place quite like it. And I know, I've been around a lot, so... - I think you're gonna enjoy it. - Yeah. I hope so. - Can I give you a hand with this? - Oh, no, I'm fine. I got it. - You've been already so helpful. - All right. It was an absolute pleasure meeting you, Taylor. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you too. Thank you for, you know, rescuing me. Ah, yeah, no, it was fun. Fun. We should do it again real soon. Yeah, so fun. Or not. Okay, thank you. Hope to see you around. Yeah, that'd be great. All right. Hello? - Hey, hey! There she is! - Oh! Craig, hi! It's so nice to see you! Oh, so good to see you too. We were a little worried - about the weather. Glad you made it. - Yeah, more or less. - Aunt Taylor! - Oh, my gosh, Zoe! You've gotten so big! - Hi, Christine. Thank you so much for letting me stay. - Of course. - Your house is so beautiful. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I'm so glad we could get you to Forest Ridge. Yeah, it's such a nice change of pace from going to Seattle - all the time, right? - Yup, I made it! Four years later, here I am! - Let me take your jacket. - We're just happy that you're here now. - I made you a drawing! - You did? Why don't you go get it, sweetie? She's been working on it all morning. She's so excited to show you. - How was the drive? - Uh, it was very... exhilarating. My car is actually in a ditch right now, - but a kind stranger gave me a lift and dropped me off. - Why didn't you give me a call? - I had no signal. - Ah, right. - Were you scared? - I was cold, but I'm here now and I couldn't be happier. - Here you go. - This is for me? - Yeah. - Wait, is this me? - That's very impressive. - She's so talented. - Well, thank you. - You're welcome. Um, I'm gonna need you to call a tow truck in the morning. - Absolutely. Yeah, no problem. - Okay. Well, dinner's almost ready. Why don't you get settled in? - Okay. - I'll show you your room! Yes, please! Yay! - Hi! - Hi! - Guess what. - What? - I have a surprise for you. - Really? Thank you! You're welcome. Wait, where... - Where did I put it? - Put what? Uh... My phone. I must have left it in the car. Which I will get tomorrow, because right now we have some reading to do. - I like this one. - That's a really good choice. All right. I thought you and Danny hit it off. We did. He is great, except... Except? I don't know, living in Seattle, I just keep meeting these tech bros. They're all the same. They have their own startup, brilliant minds, awkwardly cute. They plan to take over the world and become millionaires by the time they're 30. That doesn't sound so bad. Yeah, except for the fact that the only books they read are on tiny little screens. But maybe they're right. Right about what? That, as much as I love what I do, libraries are obsolete. Not as long as you have anything to say about it, right? Hey, did I ever tell you that my little sister, back in high school, wouldn't date a guy unless he could name all three Brontë sisters? No, that's not true. No. Two out of three was okay. - That's better. - Oh, yeah, that's a lot better. Gotta run. Gimme a kiss. - I'll call the tow truck when I get to work, okay? - Okay. Thank you. - And listen, why don't you come by the Graff later? - Yeah, for sure. - All right. I love you. - Okay. - Love you too. Have a good day. - Bye. Hey... somewhere out there, there's a guy who's gonna appreciate your love for books. Zoe, come on! Gotta scoot! How are we doing? - Pretty good. - Good stuff. Um, the folks in 401 called down. - They've got a leaky faucet. - Oh, okay. I'll go check it out. Yeah, and, uh... Joel Sheenan and that other fella are in the office. Sounds like they're going over some more bids. Perfect. Just in time to turn the Graff into Montana's newest all inclusive - entertainment experience. - Yeah, I guess so. Um, so you're coming to the meeting tonight, right? - Yes, of course, absolutely. - Okay. But if these guys get their hands on those permits... we won't recognize this place. What room was that? - Um, 401. Thank you. - 401. Okay. - Oh, man, am I glad to see you! - You must be Taylor. - Hi. - Everything checks out. - You might wanna start it up, let it run for a bit. - Okay, yeah, I'll do that. - How much do I owe you? - All taken care of. Wait, really? Craig did not have to do that. Actually, it was a fellow by the name of Joel Sheenan settled the bill. - Wait, what? - You're good to go. Have a good day. Uh, yeah, you too! Okay... - You're looking for something? - Ah... - Right. It was in your car. - You know, I think there's an outside chance you might... have dropped this in the trunk. I mean, losing my phone twice in one day, - that's not a good thing. - Oof... Well, if it makes you feel any better, I once misplaced a really, really big cow. It was a little awkward. But I did find her, though. I mean, eventually. So... I mean, these things happen. - That's good to know. - Yeah. - What happened to your truck? - Oh, yeah. Uh... Well, I... I tend to switch things up from time to time, and uh... what do you think? I don't know. You seem like more of a truck guy to me. - Do I? Hmm. - I mean, you did just tell me a story about a cow. It's a true story. I just don't know if it'll fit in the back of your auto. Oh, it's roomier than it looks. Um, listen, I really appreciate you calling me a tow truck, but I cannot let you pay for it. No, of course not. No, absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of it. - I mean, come on, we just met. - It's a little forward. But what I will do is I'm gonna write my number down right here and I'm gonna give it to you. What you do with it, you know, that's on your own accord, but I'm hoping maybe, just maybe, you'll call me, and maybe we go grab coffee, and then... you can pay me back. What do you say? It's a deal. Well, all right then. All right. - Until then. - Until then. A Harvest Ball? If we could get that on our files, - I mean, that'd be great. - Absolutely. And we can... - Hey, look who made it! - Hi! Taylor, I want you to meet Samantha Wilde. - Sam, this is my sister, Taylor. - Hi. - So nice to meet you! - You too. Sam runs the front desk and makes sure that everybody stays nice and happy around here. How do you like our little town so far? - Oh, my gosh, it is so beautiful! - Yeah. - And I hear that you guys have something big coming up. - Yes, the autumn Harvest Ball - next week. That's when we really shine. - A ball? - That sounds fancy. - It used to be. It's way more casual now. It's a lot of fun for the whole town. Oh, excuse me. Hey, so I called about your car this morning and they said it was already taken care of. - How are ya? - Uh, yeah, looks like my kind stranger - came through again. - Does this kind stranger have a name? I know that look. - No, you are not setting me up. I don't think so. - All right, have it your way. So, what do you think of the place? It really is so lovely. - It's like stepping back in time. - Yeah, it's over 100 years old, and all things considered, she could go for another 100. Assuming we can stop her from getting completely gutted. - What do you mean? - There's some developers. And they say they can bring more money into town if they bring in more businesses and tourists and stuff. All we have to do is turn this into a fancy new resort. - I mean, I like it the way it is. - Which is exactly what I plan on telling the town council tonight at the meeting. Oh, yeah, I saw the flyer at your house. Yeah. Hey, you should come along. I mean, I can use all the help I can get. - Okay, yeah. Sure. - Great. Let me show you around. Awesome. Brought an extra sandwich, if you want. - One of my favorites. - Oh, mine, too. I'm Joyce Calvin, the librarian here. Oh! Taylor Harris. So nice to meet you. Harris, ah! You must be Zoe's aunt. How did you know? Zoe always talks about her aunt Taylor being a librarian too. She's been very excited about your visit. Oh, well, not as excited as I was to see her. Why don't I open up a card for you so you can check that out? Oh, I mean, that's so nice, but I've read this probably a dozen times and I don't know how long - I'm gonna be here, so... - Well, you are here. Think of it like visiting an old friend. - I love that. Thanks. - Okay. The point is, why say anything at all? Look, just go to the meeting, smile nice, and let them get it out their system. Thank you. - Huh? - Ray, it's more important than that, you know, I just... I want everyone to know we're on the same team. Team, shmeam! Listen, when those tourist dollars start rolling in, everyone's gonna be your best friend. - Thank you. - That's not gonna be for two months! Like, in the meantime, I'd like the whole town to be on board. All right, you wanna make a speech, right? Let everyone know how much you're looking forward to going to this Harvest Ball thing. - I mean, that's all they wanna talk about anyway. Thank you. - Uh, well, it happens to be - a pretty big deal around here. - Okay. Better idea. You find a date and you go to the ball. I mean, who's gonna stay mad at you when you're tripping - the light fantastic? Right? - Ray, Ray, I ain't tripping any light fantastic at the ball or otherwise. Anyways, I got some stuff here, you gotta... - Uh... - W... where you going? Uh... I... I will see you back at the hotel. at the hotel. I... I got something. Joel! - Taylor, hey! - Hi! What are you doing here? Uh, I had this, uh, business thing. It's... So, how's the town treating you? Find your way around? I am, actually. I just stopped by the library and got myself a card. Oh! That's a good choice, although, you know I've always been more of a Charlotte fan. - Charlotte? - Charlotte Brontë. Instead of Emily. You know, Jane Eyre. But we cannot forget their favorite sister. And how could we ever forget Anne? Oh, I love Anne! You're full of a lot of surprises, aren't you? Joel! Is that your business thing? Yeah, I gotta go. Sorry. - Uh, I'll call you about that coffee. - I'm looking forward to it. Bye! All right, everyone, settle down. As you all know, we're here to take public comment on the permit phase of the proposed renovations of the Graff Hotel. Craig Harris has asked - to get the ball rolling. - Yeah. Thanks, Phyllis. Um, I just wanna say that, well... I've been working at the Graff for four years now. I suppose that means I know it as well as anybody. I didn't grow up here like a lot of you did. When my wife Christine introduced me to her hometown, it's safe to say that I was smitten. With my wife, too. Since then, I've fallen in love with Forest Ridge and everything about it, especially the Graff. It's part of our history in this town, and I think that's something that should be preserved and cherished. And I don't think it should be sacrificed for a quick profit. Thank you. - Thank you, Craig. - Great job! I'm gonna open the floor now. Who's next? Uh, excuse me. I'd like to say something. Oh. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, my name is Joel Sheenan. Well, I'm the reason that we're all here tonight. You see, my company, we bought the Graff Hotel. And with these permits, we intend to make some pretty big changes. My family has deep, deep roots here in Forest Ridge, So I am doing this because I love this town. I've seen towns like ours grow and prosper by attracting visitors every year. That's the goal. You see, but what they realized was that, as important as their history is, they can't let it hold them back. They need to move into the 21st century. They need to plan ahead for the future, and so do we. The plans that we have for the Graff Hotel, they're gonna be good for this town. That's why we need this council to endorse these permits. It's for us, so we can take that next step forward and prepare for the future. 'Cause we don't want our history to hold us back. Oh. Again, my name is Joel Sheenan, and I thank you for your time. I actually have a question. - Sure. - Isn't the Graff Hotel 100 years old? So that means it's eligible for a landmark status. For landmark status, the state of Montana says we have to prove that a significant historical event took place - involving the building. - That's exactly right. Thank you, Phyllis. And, uh, according to our research, there's no evidence of that with the Graff Hotel. - Well, who did this research? - Well, I hired some extremely reputable experts to look into it. You mean your company hired people to look up the landmark status for a building that you want to develop? Um... You could put it that way, yeah. Okay, so you're saying that if we find a significant event happened at the Graff, and then the hotel would be preserved? According to the state of Montana, yes. Well, I don't know, maybe Mr. Sheenan's idea of significant is really just in his own best interest. Oh, okay. Okay, okay. - Look, that's a little far... - Uh, Phyllis? Maybe we could take some time to explore this, uh, before the council makes their final decision? All right. This is what we'll do. We'll take a week to look this over, then we'll reconvene and hear what everyone has to say. Any objections? Good. Meeting adjourned. This is a disaster. You did it! I just got the ball started. We still gotta find some proof. Yeah, but this looks like this is really in your wheelhouse. What do you say? Wanna give us a hand with this? Yeah, sure. Great. You made quite the impression last night. Everybody's talking about it. I got to admit, I was a little surprised, the way you called out Joel Sheenan like that. Yeah, well, he threw me a curveball too. Do you remember that kind stranger I told you about? - Wait, that was Joel? - Yes. And I can't tell Craig, obviously, because he's not exactly his favorite person right now. - This is true. - He seems so nice, too, and so down-to-earth. I... I can't believe I fell for that story that he grew up in Forest Ridge. That wasn't a story. Joel and I went to school together. - Wait, you did? - Yeah. We did really well, too. Honor roll, valedictorian... He never really made a big deal out of it, though, so none of us really knew how well he did until he got a full ride to college. Okay, I don't understand. How did he get the money - to buy the hotel? - After graduation, we all thought he'd move back to the ranch, work with his dad, but he ended up getting recruited - by some tech company in California. - Another tech guy. Yeah, so he stayed there until his stock was vested, and that's how he got a startup off the ground. - He has his own company? - Yeah. Helped develop a couple apps that got a lot of attention. So, he seems to be doing quite all right for himself. Okay, so this is what I don't understand. If he doesn't live here, why even buy the hotel? I've been wondering that myself. But I will say I'm not surprised - he stopped to help you the other day. - What do you mean? Growing up, Joel was always the first person to lend a helping hand to anybody who needed it, so maybe the hotel is his way of giving back to the town. No, 'cause why make all these changes - that nobody wants? - Maybe you should ask him - the next time you see him. - I can't. I promised Craig I would help him, and I can't do that and hang out with Joel at the same time. Besides, I need to focus. I have to... - I have to find a job. - Yeah, no, we don't want anything to distract you. Ooh. Hey, Dad. Heading into town. Should be home for dinner. Heard the meeting last night got mighty interesting. Oh, yeah. News travel fast in Forest Ridge. Social media got nothing on us. - What are you gonna do? - Got not much I can do - until we get those permits. - I'm not talking about permits, Son. I'm talking about all those people that need to know you're acting in good faith. I told them, Dad. I did what I could. I'm here to help. The way they see it, part of their town, part of their history, is changing forever. There's no record of anything historically significant happening at the Graff Hotel. You mean besides me falling in love with your mother - at our first Harvest Ball. - Besides that, of course. See, that's what it's all about, Joel. Things people remember. What they wore, the song they danced to first, the way the lights shined a certain way. Me... - I'll always remember the wallpaper. - The wallpaper? In a hallway on the way to the ballroom. I remember Hattie and I were on our way in, we were... Geez. We were just a couple of kids, all dressed up for a grownup fancy ball. I noticed the blue in the wallpaper matched the color of her eyes. I knew right then and there we were gonna be dancing at that ball for the rest of our lives. You never told me this story. Oh. Guess it's been on my mind lately, what with the ball coming up and... how your mother and I never missed one. Till now. I know. I'm sorry, Dad. I miss her too. You wanna talk about historical significance, you take a look at that wallpaper. Quick question. Did I come on too strongly about my preference for Charlotte instead of Emily? I... What? No, no, no. I mean, I get it. I get it. I can really dig my heels in when it comes to the Brontë sisters, oh... You were very diplomatic. Okay, then I'm stumped. I... I am because up until that point, I didn't think we disagreed about, well, anything. Of course, up until the meeting, that is. Joel, look, when you stopped to help me, I thought you were just this nice small-town guy who probably looks really cool riding a horse. Well, to be fair, to be fair, if you find the right horse it's hard to look bad. What I didn't know is that you own your own tech company and you drive a flashy car and you can afford to buy and refurbish old hotels. Okay, technically, it's one hotel... - That's probably not the point. - No, no. The point is... is... you weren't what you said you were, and you left out some pretty important details. It's just... ...the thing is, it's like anytime I tell people what I do or about my foundation or I talk about my collection of... of... of first editions - or art or anything... - Wait, you collect books? See? Right there. That's what I'm talking about. You see? People see me in a completely different light and then it... it's like there's this enormous elephant in the room - and I have to work so hard to get around it - Okay, Joel, wait. Stop. There's something I haven't told you yet. There are a lot of people in this town who love that old hotel. You noticed? One of those people happens to be my brother. Craig Harris. You... your brother's Craig. Oh... The one I'm visiting. That's why you came to town. Okay. So now that I know who you are and you know who I am, I think... I think it's probably best if you just send me the tow truck bill. Then I'm guessing you... wanna pass on a cup of coffee. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Bye. Bye. And redesign the main floor to accommodate new shops and a restaurant. You can look at the floor plans to see which spaces you prefer and... Oh! I'll let Joel tell you about this part. - Joel? - Hmm? Uh. This way. My favorite part is what they call the grand ballroom. Oh, uh... It's the decorating committee for the ball. I told them it's okay to get started, but if you need the room... No, please. You, um... just go ahead. All right. I'll tell you what. Um, in the meantime, we can, uh, go back to my office and let them finish up and we'll take a look at the plans. How's that sound? - Uh, would you mind escorting them, Ray? - Oh, yeah, sure. Right this way. This is gonna look great, Craig. - Colors. You know, lights. - Hmm. Corn, man. It's just... It's corn. - I'm gonna go to my meeting. - Okay. I have work to do. But I needed to tell you. - Good job. - Thank you. Don't you forget it. I mean, just, like, wow! See you later. Wow. Right. So I'm sure you both agree that this is an opportunity of a lifetime. Again, thanks for coming. I'll call you guys next week. You okay? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. What's with the sudden fascination with wallpaper? Yeah, I wasn't... mm, fascinated. Listen, buddy, you gotta keep your head in the game. - Word's getting around. - What are you talking about? I'm talking about the fact that the locals aren't crazy about this project. I'm getting a few calls from our potential store tenants. They wanna know if we're still moving forward. - Of course we are. - Then we better make sure that this doesn't steamroll on us. Uh, maybe... you know, maybe that's not a bad idea about you - finding a date for the shindig. - Right... Hey! Lay on the charm. Do a little schmoozing. Ray, I am not taking a date to the ball - to make people like me. - All I'm saying is we gotta do something. Hang on. Think about it. We got a lot riding on this. Hey. Okay. Are you enjoying your visit with Catherine and Heathcliff? - Very much. - I was thinking, my part-time librarian recently moved to Denver, and I've been looking for someone to help out around here, - if you're interested. - Oh. Yeah. I mean, that would be amazing, I just... I... I don't know how long I'm here for. Well, while you are here, I could sure use your help. That's... Yes! I would love to. Wonderful. Come by tomorrow and we'll get you started. - All right. Thanks. - Okay. I was wondering if you could help me find a book. Well, you see, I finished this one. - Again. - Jane Eyre. - That's impressive. - And I'm looking for something a little different. And I figured, who better to ask than a librarian? Well, I don't officially work here yet. Well, then we'll make it unofficial. I'm looking for something a little bit... less dramatic and more down-to-earth. You know, with people who don't necessarily belong together, but they're willing to take a chance even if the odds are stacked against them. Well, it might not be a happy ending. There's only one way to find out. Let me give you a tour of the hotel tonight. - Why would you wanna do that? - Because, Taylor, I respect the fact that you're standing by your brother. I do. But I also think that, if you get to know me better, that you can decide for yourself the person that I really am. So... a tour? It's just a tour. Not a date. Come on! You're ridiculous. Um... Yeah. Okay. - I'll see you at seven. - Tonight. Tonight. Oh, and uh... Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet. So, the idea is to remodel and refurbish, but you can still keep the feel of the old hotel. If you want it to feel old, why don't you just - keep it the way it is? - Nah. People still want the amenities, they just want 'em wrapped in a more nostalgic package, - right? - I hear ya on the nostalgia. - Wow, this looks like it's been here a long time. - My dad still remembers it from the first time he brought my mom to the ball. They used to go? They did. Every year. She passed away last year. - I'm sorry. - Thank you. First time he came here, he saw that wallpaper. The way the color matched my mom's eyes. He knew he would spend the rest of his life with her. It sounds so simple... ...having two people just... know. I think it is. Or if it's the right two people. Come with me. It's the best part. Oh! What's that? Oh, I thought you might get hungry. Is this part of your tour? - Well, I can always have them take it back. - It's fine. But it's still not a date. Didn't say it was. Your jacket, milady. Oh. Thank you. - Uh. Thank you. - After you. Chivalry's not dead, it's just been on vacation. Until you met me. Craig and I grew up in Seattle. He's actually the reason I got my first librarian job. - Really? - Mm-hmm. We were in high school, and this one summer, our local library was looking for a volunteer and I wanted the job more than anything. So... ...Craig took the bus all the way downtown so that he could go talk to the head librarian and he told him that no one loves books as much as I do and that he would never have even opened a book if it weren't for me. He must have been really convincing because I got the job and... he's been there for me ever since. - He sounds like a great brother. - He is. And very determined once he makes his mind up about something. This much I know. Craig thinks you're doing this whole thing for the town as a business deal. And what do you think? I believe you wanna help the town... and that your intentions are good, but... - But? - Why the Graff? Why all the extra time and money? Isn't there something else you can do to help the town? Growing up my dad and I, we used to work the ranch all the time. You know, sometimes... we would camp out overnight, just the two of us, under the stars, and we'd talk all night. It was so special. I used to wish I had a magic wand... ..and that I could wave it. We should make those moments last a little bit longer. - You know? - Sounds wonderful. That's how I feel about this town... and all the people. That if I could just... wave a magic wand and make Forest Ridge the way it was when I was growing up, I... It turns out I'm not a wizard. I... I don't have a wand. Things are always changing, Joel. You're right. And all we can do is make sure and try to change them for the better. That's all I wanna do. I wanna help my hometown grow and keep all the things... that make it so special. Like the Harvest Ball? What are you doing? - May I? - Oh. No. No, I'm not... I'm not much of a dancer. Eh, follow my lead. I can't believe I'm doing this. It's all in the hips, baby. What are you talking about? Look at you. - You're a great dancer. - You're a great partner. I'm not gonna argue with that. It's true. Listen, Taylor, I was wondering... um... you... um... and me... Oh, my gosh, I... Why do I suddenly feel like I'm back in high school? Uh... Well, from what I hear, you were actually really cool - in high school. - Yeah, that's debatable. I don't know. Okay. Would you like to go to the ball with me? Wait, seriously? Seriously. Whoa. Um... - Uh... Wait, Craig. - No, I just... I, um, - I saw the light, I thought somebody had forgotten to... - Craig! Sorry. Sorry. You okay? I don't know. - Hey. - Hey. Listen, Craig, about tonight... - You don't have to explain. - I want to. When my car broke down in the ditch, Joel was the guy that ended up stopping and helping me. - Yeah, I kind of put that together. - And he was so nice and we hit it off, but I had no idea how you really felt about him until the meeting. I know I probably should've told you about tonight, but I thought maybe if I went and talked to him, I could change his mind. Taylor, I'm not upset that you danced with Joel. - But the way you left, I... - I can take that place apart and put it back together again. If Joel runs through this place with his plans, they won't need me anymore. You mean you won't have a job? I didn't say it, but it just makes sense. Once that hotel's all new and shiny, why keep me around? Craig, I really don't think he's like that. He's a businessman. Sooner or later, they all do the math. Well, you heard the council. All we have to do is find a historically significant thing. - You really think that's possible? - It's what I do! Besides, I know how much it means to you, and I... I promise you I will not stop until I find something. Did he ask you to the ball? I haven't given him my answer yet. You should go. It's a lot of fun. You never know. This might be the last. You know, I know why you're here and I completely understand. Look, Craig is your brother - and you want to help him. - You're right, I do wanna help him. But I also wanna go to the Harvest Ball with you. Oh, wait. Wait. Uh... - You do? - I do, as long as you're okay with me doing everything humanly possible to save the Graff Hotel. Oh, okay. I have to admit this is without a doubt the most unusual offer I've ever had. So, what do you say? Is it a date? Oh, what do I say? Uh... As long as you understand... I'm not gonna go easy just 'cause it's you. I would expect no less. Well then, it's a date. A darn good one. I look very much forward to it. The best way of digging up the hotel's history was from some local sources. Perhaps a first person's account? Much better than searching the internet, yes. And considering you know the area so well, - I was hoping you could point me in the right direction. - Ah! - I may have one idea. - Great. Over the years, the library's collected a kind of archive of the town's history. Newspapers, photographs, uh, letters and diaries. - What do you do with all these? - Well, the plan was to have it digitized and online, but as you can see, we haven't made much progress. If you think it can help. - It looks like a great place to start. - Oh, wonderful. Okay. All right. Wow! You see, I thought I was the only one who came in early. Yeah, well, I had some time before the library opened, so I figured I would help out with the decorations. Very nice. Do you wanna help? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That is, uh... - way beyond my skill set. - No, it's not! Come on. It's easy. I'll show you. Sit. Okay. Okay. You're gonna take one of these and you are going to bend the floral wire into a J, - and then you're gonna place it right beneath there. - The... Uh, - the letter J? - Yeah. Or like a little loop. I think I might... single-handedly ruin the entire ball. Okay, no, let's, um... - Glue? - Let's try this one. - Here, we'll do this together. - Uh... So, we're gonna take the wire, gonna bend it like this, and then we're going to weave it through. Hey, pay attention. Would you like to come to the ranch tonight and have dinner with my dad and me? - Dinner? - Yeah. Come on, he's a good cook. And I'd love to show you around the ranch if you're not too busy. Uh, yeah, I'd love that. - Hey. - Ooh! Brr! That wind really cuts through you, doesn't it? Oh, yeah, that's nothing. Around here, it's not really cold - until your eyelashes freeze over. - Oh, don't even joke! - Here, come on. Let me take your jacket. - Oh, thank you. Of course. - Taylor, welcome! - Hi. Thank you so much - for inviting me. - My pleasure. Um, sorry to say I'm gonna have to skip dinner, though. One of the calves stopped taking the bottle. I gotta get out there and see if I can - get her to eat something. - No, come on, Dad, you've been outside all day! Let me go. L... let me... let me go. Let me take a shot at it. You have a guest. - No, I mean, this is important. - Look, I'm sorry, Taylor, I think we're gonna have to reschedule. I mean, this could take a while. - Well, I'd love to help if I could. - Are you sure? You know it's gonna get a lot colder out there, right? You know, I think my eyelashes can take it. - All right. - All right, let's go. So, does this happen a lot? Yeah, you know, it's... it's always something. Yeah, that's all right. It's too hot, it's too cold, river's flooding... - ...river's dried up. - Sounds like a lot of fun. Oh, yeah, it's a barrel of monkeys. So, is that why you left? To get away from... I'm sorry, it's probably none of my business. No, uh... It's a fair question. If I love this place so much, why leave it? You know, no matter how much I love Forest Ridge, I just had this feeling... the things I wanted in life, they weren't here. Does that make sense? I didn't even know what that was, but I knew that... it was out there somewhere, and if I wanted to find it, then I had to leave the place I love. So, have you found it? What you're looking for? Not yet. Feels like I'm getting closer all the time. All right. Here. Come here. Come on. There we go. Oh, there we go. - Good girl. - Is she gonna be okay? Yeah, she's gonna be just fine. You all right? Yeah. Hey! Paul Bunyan! - I thought you were coming into town. - Yeah. My dad's got about a 100 things to do around here. - Figured I'd give him a hand, you know? - Uh-huh. Have you been checking your messages recently? - My phone's in the house. Why, what's going on? - Alan's trying to reach you. - The whole system crashed this morning. - What? - Yep. - Does that mean we head back or... Don't know yet. Let's see what Alan says when he gets us back online. Besides, you need to be here for that meeting - with the town council. - Yeah. And the ball. Since when was that on your calendar? Yeah, yeah, decided I'm gonna go. Wait, with an actual date? As a matter of fact, Ray, yes, with an actual date. You sly dog! You see, now? This is what I'm talking about, right? Chopping wood, going to the ball This is how we're gonna win the hearts and minds around here. - Wait a minute. No, wait, wait, wait, don't move, don't move. - No. I should take a picture, you know. You and the axe for the website. - No, no, no. Look. - Yeah, why? What... I'm gonna go call Alan, make sure everything's all right. - Hey. - Oh, hey. How old is that thing? Um, I believe Lincoln was President. And somehow you still keep it up and running. Yeah, against all odds. - What brings you down here? - Uh, Sam said you were down here. I walked Zoe over from the library. She's upstairs helping with the decorating. Yeah. I'm almost done here. I'll just tighten that and we're good. Good. All right. - How goes the search? - Uh, good. I mean, it's going. There's still a couple days until the meeting and I'm hoping something turns up. Hey, um... - Sorry for getting you involved in all this. - What do you mean? Uh, it's just... I mean... what are we hanging on to, you know? A bunch of old stories and a few fond memories. It's... It's all right. Okay, those are important things too. Oh, I know they are. It's just... You heard what Joel said. Man, that guy can be convincing when he really wants something. Yeah, well, so can I. - Yeah, you're telling me. - Uh, hey, what's in here? Oh. This is the old maids' quarters. - Wait, people lived at the hotel? - Oh, yeah. Back in the day, they were on call 24/7. Management wanted them close, so they put them up in here. - Do you mind if I check it out? - Yeah, go ahead, all right. - Thank you! - Uh-huh. Don't get in any trouble. Wait, what... Find anything interesting? Maybe. The letters are addressed to Catherine Donnelly, care of the hotel. This must be her. She immigrated from Dublin and made her way cross-country to Montana. - She worked at the Graff? - Sounds like she was a maid - soon after it opened. - What happened to her? I don't know, she must have moved on. But she left these behind. Maybe we can... - Actually, Joyce, do you have a magnifying glass? - Um... - Yeah, sure. - Great. Here you go. Okay, so you see that woman on the right? I think that's Mary Catherine. But check this out. The guy in the middle, right in front, who does that look like? - Whoa. - Right? Oh. - Is that... - It sure looks like him. - Oh, my gosh... - President Theodore Roosevelt. Oh, my... Theodore Roosevelt was President from 1901 to 1909. During that time, he travelled all across the country while he was in office. I just can't find anything that says he's been in Forest Ridge. Well, maybe he was just passing through. But suppose he was here on official business? I think that would be a piece of history worth saving. Along with the hotel where it happened! How do we find out? Well, now that we know the timeframe, we can just narrow down the dates. - Okay. Back to square one. - I think it's our best shot. Well, let's get started! Hey, Alan. Yeah, what's going on? All right. Yeah, no, keep me posted. Okay. All right, thanks. Uh, so? He caught it in time, but we were definitely hacked. Uh, let me call him. I'll get on top of it. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. - All right. I'll catch you inside. - All right, cool. - Hey there. - Hi. Listen, I... I'm sorry I didn't call earlier. I just... Oh, I've been putting out fires everywhere today. It's Okay. Things are hopping over here too. - How's our hungry calf doing? - Much better, thank you for asking. You know, in fact, she wanted me to, well, invite you over so she could personally thank you for your help. Oh. She did, did she? Listen, listen, I know that this is, well, incredibly last second notice, but um... what do you think if we rescheduled the dinner for tonight? I promise you, no cattle wrangling this time. Sounds good. I'll see you tonight. See you tonight. Thank you. That was so amazing. Learned to cook on a campfire. It's an old Sheenan family tradition. A tradition that's been passed down to the next generation? Ah, it's hard to tell. He's not much on the great outdoors these days. Yeah, that ought to tell you something. So, Joel tells me that you're going to the Harvest Ball together. I'm really looking forward to it. I don't know if he told you, but that ball is another Sheenan family tradition. Never missed a one. Joel too, when he was growing up. You should've seen the little tyke in a suit and tie. Man, I think I got pictures around here somewhere. No. No, you don't... She doesn't wanna see any photos. - No, I sure do. - Maybe later. Little fella was so shy, he couldn't get up the courage to ask a girl to dance, so he would ask his mom. - Oh, God, here we go... - Which is how he learned to move around the floor - so well. - That's so sweet. Of course, he hasn't been back to the ball since, uh, when? - Since you went off to college? - Uh... Yeah. Guess he just hasn't met anybody he wanted to take... until now. - That's very subtle, Dad. That's very subtle. - Hmm. Which one is your mom? Uh, right there in the middle. - She's beautiful. - Never more beautiful than at the Harvest Ball. And that hardworking young fella is Timothy Patrick Sheenan, my great-grandfather. - That's the only photo we even have of him. - Yeah. - Where was that taken? - Right here. You know, he built that cabin back before Montana was even a state. He cleared the land for the ranch... - got married, had a family. - Hmm. And the Sheenan family has been here ever since. There's something about this photo. What do you mean? I don't know, but I can't put my finger on it. I don't understand why there's nothing online about him travelling to Forest Ridge. I mean, he was the president. Shouldn't there be some sort of record? Maybe they didn't know he was here. Right. Teddy Roosevelt just happened to slip under the radar and come to Forest Ridge, Montana. Well, if anybody can get to the bottom of this, you can. I knew there was something about this photo. What? There's two feet of snow on the ground. It must have been freezing, and no one's wearing a coat, not even Roosevelt. Huh! Yeah, you're right. When I saw the snow, I assumed it was winter, - but look at the trees. - They're covered with leaves. Exactly. So it must have been taken in the spring. That happens sometimes. We get a freak snowstorm - that time of year. - So maybe Roosevelt didn't know that and he wasn't expecting snow. But still, there must have been a reason he was in Montana at that time. - So, how do we find that out? - So, my girlfriend Caitlin, she works at the National Archives in DC. So I emailed her the photo and she said she was going to search the records to see all the travelling that the President did during that time. Can she find out before the town council meet? Fingers crossed. She said she would get back to me as soon as possible. But I think it's looking good. In the meantime, instead of just sitting around and waiting, I figured I would come help decorate. - What can I do? - Yeah, uh, can you help bring in the rest of the centerpieces - from the lobby? - Of course. So every year, the locals have this big harvest dance thing here at the hotel. It's actually a lot of fun. You wanna talk about dedication? Joel here is so determined to win over his old hometown to make sure those permits get approved, he actually went out and found himself a date for the dance. It's all right, don't get me wrong, she seems very nice, but this won't be just any old date on his arm. Her brother just so happens to be the leading opposition. So if I know my buddy Joel at all, those permits are in the bag. What a pleasant surprise! I literally just got done saying hello to our girl. I decided to drive all the way out here to tell you in person that I'm not going to the ball with you. You can find someone else to win over your hometown. - What are you talking about? - I was there. I heard everything. You know, all the things Ray said to the guys about your real reason for asking me? No! No, no. Taylor, - you don't understand. That wa... - You're right, I don't understand. I don't understand how the guy that I'm starting to care about isn't real. You're not who I thought you were. You said you weren't sure that you'd ever find what you were looking for. Looks like you just found it. Taylor! Ray said those things? And you didn't speak up? No, Dad, I didn't. I didn't say anything. I was in a business meeting. There's a time and a place, and that wasn't it. Some things mean more than money. Thought you knew that, Son. - Oh, hi. - Hey. Christine told me what happened with Joel today. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. You were right. This was just another business deal. Hmm. I didn't want to be right this time. What? When Joel drove you into town, I knew how you felt about him. And there's a part of me that hoped that whatever it is that you saw in him would be who he was. Yeah. - Me too. - But look, the council meeting's tonight, and one way or another, this is all gonna get settled. And when it does, I want you to promise me something. Well, that depends what the promise is. Okay. I want you to promise me that you are going to come to the ball with Christine and I. - Craig... - Just come see what the fuss is about. Come to the ball and see how much this town means to all of us. Okay, fine, I'll go. Okay, fine, we'll have you. - See you in a bit. - See you in a bit. All right, Joel, you got this. Just give them that sunny smile and remind them how great this is gonna be. All right? Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh! It's my friend Caitlin at the Archives! - I have to get to the library! - The meeting's about to start. Yeah. Yeah, I know. Um, don't worry, I'll be right back. - What do you mean? T... Taylor! - I'll be right back, don't worry! Thank you, Caitlin! Thank you, Teddy Roosevelt! Town meeting. All right, folks, let's get started. As you all know, we're here to take public comment - on whether the Graff Hotel... - We need to stall. She said she needs more time. ...or even can be designated an historic landmark. Craig? Uh, Craig, are you ready? - Craig? - Hi. - Yes. Please. Yes. - Yeah, I'm ready. So... - Is everything all right there? - Yeah, I just... just have to... It's a little... uh... I got it, I got it. - Come on, come on! - Okay. In addition to all of the social events that we, uh... that we hold at the... the Graff. Like, uh, the Harvest Ball, which... Yeah, right? I know we're all looking forward to the Harvest Ball! - Absolutely. - Yes. Absolutely. - As I'm sure you are. - Indeed. Yes. So... I think it's also, uh, relevant and, uh, very important to... pay close attention to the, um, civic benefits that the... - Do you have a... a point? - I do. I'm getting there. - I'm getting there. I'm sorry. - Okay. The Graff is old. It... it's... it's the right kind of old, it's a good old. We have a furnace down there - that your grandfather couldn't repair. - Can you please... We've been over this. Being old doesn't qualify a building for landmark status. I'm afraid unless you have something new to add, you're going to have to yield the floor. I am making a point. I'm... I'm making... I have several points and I'm just... I may be able to help with that. Oh, crap! Sorry I'm late, everybody. Okay. I think I may have found proof that shows that the Graff Hotel deserves to be a historic landmark. Uh, do you mind if I... - Oh, please, yes. - Yeah. It's online. Mary Catherine Donnelly worked as a maid at the Graff Hotel from 1900 to 1903. We don't know much about her, except for a few letters that she left behind after she moved on. Fortunately, she also left behind some photographs. One in particular was very interesting. In April 1903, Mary Catherine had her photograph taken next to President Theodore Roosevelt... ...in front of the Graff Hotel. Teddy Roosevelt was in Forest Ridge? Mm-hmm. That spring, he was at Yellowstone National Park to lay the cornerstone of the Roosevelt Arches, which still stand at the North entrance today. Teddy loved this part of the West more than anything, so he decided to stay and do a little bit more exploring. What nobody was expecting was that it was going to be the coldest spring on record. A freak snowstorm rolled in, leaving three feet of snow, and Teddy and his entire crew stranded just outside Forest Ridge. By the time that the party made it back into town, they spent three nights at the Graff Hotel until the roads were clear. - And you have proof of all this? - I... I do, actually. Right here, I have a diary entry from Roosevelt. He kept one most of his life, and in April 1903, he wrote... "Snowed in at a little scrappy town called Forest Ridge." "Stayed at the Graff Hotel." "Best three nights of sleep in years." But it wasn't just the Graff that inspired him. It was... Forest Ridge. It was Montana. It was... this entire part of the country and its people and the culture that inspired him while he was snowed in. So, shortly after he went back to Washington, he decided to sign the Antiquities Act, which gave him and all of the future presidents the power to preserve the beautiful country of ours so that future generations could enjoy everything that he had. By making the Graff Hotel a historic landmark, we are not only celebrating Roosevelt's legacy, we are celebrating the spirit that makes this city, this country, so special. Thank you. Thank you, Taylor. That was... Well, if we didn't love our town before, we certainly do now. Uh, now, I believe Joel Sheenan would like a chance to have his say. I love this town. I do. It's my home. And my family's been a big part of Forest Ridge for five generations. Five generations! It's crazy! If they were here, I think my great-great-grandparents, Timothy and... Mary Catherine Sheenan... ...they'd be proud to support whatever decision this council makes. Thank you. The request for building permits has been tabled, pending our official submission to the state of Montana for the Graff Hotel to be granted landmark status. You're up early. I think it's about time to head back. Thank you. I still got a business to run. Besides, it's gonna take a while to rework the plans for the Graff. You think the state will go along with the town and make the hotel an official landmark? It's pretty hard to argue with Teddy Roosevelt. What Taylor found... about Mary Catherine, your great-great-grandmother... it's kinda part of our history too. Hmm. Harvest Ball's tonight. You don't think you could hold off leaving for one more day? No, Dad, I can't, I ju... You know, I'm about the last person that anybody wants to see at the ball. Especially Taylor. Truth is, um... I made up my mind to go. As a remembrance to your mother. But it... it'd be my first one without her and... kinda hoping you'd be there... to help get me through it. Okay. I'll stay, Dad. But I won't drink this. You can't make me do it. Looks like dirt. - Wow, look at you! - Oh, thanks. - Sitter's here. - Okay, great. I am almost ready. Oh, hey, guess what? The library in Seattle called and they want me back. Get out! That's great! I know, right? They want me to start next week. Wow! That fast, huh? I just... after everything you did for the town, I thought you'd want to hang around. Yeah, I mean, you were so right about Forest Ridge. This place is really special, and I love it, but, uh... - I can't. I gotta get back. - Fair enough. Then let's make this Harvest Ball one that we'll never forget. - Yeah. - Perfect. Look at that. There you go. - It completes the look. - I agree. Taylor! Go, Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! Taylor! I owe you an apology. - Ray. - Joel told me you heard what I said to our investors. I'm sorry. Just got so caught up with the pitch, I didn't realize I was coming between you and Joel. I mean, it wasn't your fault. Joel could've said something. And trust me, he did. The moment those guys were gone, he told me taking you to the ball - had nothing to do with business. - Really? I mean, I didn't... I had no idea. Well, now that everything's settled, I gotta get back, but, uh... - I didn't wanna leave without telling you. - Thanks. - Wait, where is Joel? - Last time I spoke with him, he said he was heading to California. Thank you. Joel, hey, it's Taylor. Look, I just spoke with Ray and he told me what you said and that you really wanted to go to the ball with me and that that part of you that I really wanted to believe in was real. Just like you said that you were finding what you were looking for out there somewhere, I... ...I've been looking too, and I know that I have found it here with you. Anyways, I'm still at the Graff and... I'll wait for you. Just, please... please don't leave. Okay. Bye. You were right. Business or not... I should've spoken up. You didn't leave. Gosh, look at you. - Come here. - Thank you. I couldn't leave without saying I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. For showing me my great-great-grandmother's face for the first time. You know, I, uh, I recognized her name from the marriage certificate, but we never had a photo of her. Until now. Well, if I knew who she was, I obviously would've told you. Seeing them like that just... Well, I guess it made me wonder what it was like for them when they were starting out together, their whole lives ahead of them... everything brand new. Including this hotel. I guess some things just seem right. Well, maybe it is that simple. What, two people just... suddenly they know? Well, if it's the right two people. I think so. There you are. What are you doing out here? It's freezing! Come on. Party's for you too. And give the poor guy his jacket back, it's freezing here. Get your own jacket. - Shall we? - We shall. Who knew bad weather could change the lives of so many for the better? Then... and now.
