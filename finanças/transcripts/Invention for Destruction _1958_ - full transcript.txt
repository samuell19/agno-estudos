RESTORING THE WORLD OF FANTASY INVENTION FOR DESTRUCTION Freely Adapted from the Writings of Jules Verne Screenplay Narration and Dialogue Cinematography Set Design Special Effects - Animation Special Effects - Cinematography Special Effects - Scenery Music Starring Editing and Sound Production Design and Direction Good evening, friends. Come closer. I shall tell you about the greatest adventure of my life. This is my journal. Everything I experienced I confided to its pages. Forgive me. I haven't introduced myself. I am Mr. Simon Hart. I lived at a time of such hope. The dream of human progress! We could think of nothing else, my friends and I - Robur the Conqueror, Barbican, Captain Nemo. Such was the world of our youth... My story proper begins on the Atlantic. What an impression that made on me! I was a passenger on the first steamship to cross the ocean. I watched as the human spirit challenged the waves below and the empire of the air above. Every step brought new discoveries, new inventions. I trembled with giddy excitement at each new triumph of science and technology. Little did I know the role that submersible would soon play in my life. My journey continued overland. The iron horse knew no obstacles. This is terrible. Have you seen this? Such needless loss of human life. Look. Yet another invention meets its fate. Man was given legs to walk upon the earth, and there he should stay. Fortunately there have always been those not content to merely walk. They now travel just as confidently across both sea and sky. That's right - sky! For man has now ascended to realms once reserved for the eagles. And this is but the beginning. Ever more advanced airships ply the celestial seas. Flying vessels heavier than air are no longer mere fantasy. A century of steam and electricity has rendered obsolete the servants of yesteryear. The Albatross. Indeed, that was the latest word in the noble field of aeronautics, thanks to my friend Robur the Conqueror. Not even the king of birds can reach the heights this machine now rules. Finally, I was at my destination... a private sanatorium. But who was that man? Here in this sanatorium, my teacher, the brilliant scientist Professor Roch, was recuperating from his hard work on his latest invention. Greetings, Doctor. How's the professor? Calmer today. And how did you fare? I've brought all the documents. Now we just need money so he can - So he can finish his great invention in peace. Sir, you know I wish the professor every success. I believe he will find people to help him. But sometimes I fear that no good will come of this explosive device. I'm a scientist! My interest lies in chemical reactions, not their practical applications. You mean to say...? I have no money left, but I must finish my invention. I wouldn't want to be at sea tonight. By morning, word had spread like wildfire of the ruthless kidnapping of Professor Roch and his assistant, Mr. Simon Hart. Days of feverish searching ensued. Can they detain us like this? Might makes right. Strike sail, damn it. We must inform His Excellency the Count. Count Artigas, the ship's owner. Search and see for yourselves. Bravo, Your Excellency! Bravo, Your Excellency! We can sail on now. “Your Excellency.” We can sail on now, Your Excellency. Wait until nightfall. Then full steam to Back Cup. How could such a ship advance with sails furled? And where did that rope lead that disappeared into the waves? Here's the answer. Yes, the very submarine whose disappearance had so excited the world's press... and the reason the search of the schooner had proven fruitless. Allow me to welcome you on board. How do you like the most modern vessel in the world, Professor? I regret that my men had to use force, but only thus could I ensure your invention wouldn't be misused. Where is my assistant? I'm afraid I don't know. My invitation extended to you alone. You are my guest. Allow me to show you my kingdom. I rule the greatest empire in the world. With the invention of the submarine, I became master of the world's oceans. Their riches exceed the wealth of all the continents combined. The sea floor is abundant in natural resources. Treasures of gold and jewels, claimed by the seas, lie there but for the taking. All this I shall place at the service of science. I believe in your invention, your grand idea. I'll do all I can to see your work is finished. With the riches of the ocean I've created an underwater city. My factories and laboratories await you, Professor. With your genius and my resources, we shall do great things. We shall amaze the world! What right have you to hold me here? Might makes right, sir. Once on the high seas, with no danger of further naval patrols, the professor was transported from the submarine to the three-master. Professor... Captain Spade, skipper of our schooner. Mr. Serko, your future collaborator, and the builder of the factories in our underwater city, Back Cup. Allow me to show you the plans for your laboratory. Ship to port! It's the Amelie... one of the largest merchant ships in the South Atlantic... becalmed at sea. Proceed as usual. Professor... may I offer you some light refreshment? In the armored brig of the submarine, my journal became the sole custodian of my thoughts and observations. Reverse engines! Halt engines! It was now clear what dark purposes the alleged submarine catastrophe had served. The vessel had vanished only to conceal the criminal raids of a pirate gang. And its commander? The noble Count Artigas. A brief interruption, but a potentially rewarding one. Our submarine has discovered the wreck of a merchant ship. It must be a rare stroke of luck to find such a treasure ship. Such things aren't left entirely to chance. Help! We have a system. Help! What was that? Did you hear that? There! Someone called for help. I'm sure of it. It must be a castaway. Do you see anything? You're right. It's a castaway. The lifeboat. Launch the lifeboat! Quickly, damn it! On the double! Blast it! Who's in there? What are you doing here? Who let you in here? Captain, a gentleman doesn't walk in on a lady. You want to blow up the ship? Does that gunpowder there not concern you? It's no surprise the Amelie went down with a passenger like you. Pack up your things. We make land at dawn. Do many ships stop at this island? I must return soon. You'll soon see. But this island - - Land ahoy! - Back Cup ahoy! Back Cup, Professor. Another hour and we'll be home. You call a volcano home? The volcano has long been extinct. The smoke is from my factories. You've chosen a most strange residence, Count. Perhaps. But only there can you realize your ingenious invention. Our submarine passed through an undersea tunnel. As I later learned, it was the only gateway to Artigas's pirate citadel. We surfaced in a gloomy lagoon whose waters mirrored a towering crater above. Here the submarine found safe port. Artigas's satanic mills spewed clouds of oily black fumes that floated over the caldera like a threat of inevitable eruption. And most astonishing of all: On a rugged point above the waters perched his proud eagle's nest. Thus it appeared to my eyes, the residence of Count Artigas, pirate king of the modern age. On the opposite shore, a residence of a different sort awaited me: a miserable, dilapidated shack that for long months would be my home. There I spun my bold plans of escape. There I would experience both hope and despair. But I've gotten ahead of myself. Those pages in my journal were still blank. I was still a prisoner in the submarine's brig. We are home, sir. You're destroying your own dwelling, young man. What have you done with the professor? The professor is receiving royal treatment. Should he fail us, it will be up to you. - Any results? - We search for the secret of matter itself. The secret of matter? Then what? We look forward to the results of your experiments, Professor. I think his assistant might produce quicker results. The engineer? Talk to him. What is all this for? For now it's just an experiment to release the enormous forces bound inside all matter. Many other discoveries will be needed before these forces can serve mankind... to fuel machines... and provide light and warmth. But how it will be used... is for technicians and others to decide. My new invention: a machine that will rule the air. In conjunction with the professor's explosives, it will rule the world. And you, sir, in the interim shall apply your talents to it. Me? Never. I wish to speak to the professor. I can't allow that. However, you may - - I will not be your accomplice. - Suit yourself. We shall wait. Aha! In my absence they'd converted my miserable shack into a fully equipped laboratory. What a temptation! But then I thought of the professor. He would never give these bandits the secret of his invention. But I'd forgotten that my brilliant teacher was as trusting as a child. We build a solid steel tower. The main section is a chamber. We place a few grams of my new form of matter inside, hook it up to electric current and - - It explodes! An enormous energy will be released that we must channel and control and tame. That's the whole point of the experiment. I'm afraid the experiment was a failure. On the contrary, Professor. That's what I call results! Well done, Professor. Congratulations! On hearing the explosion, I realized that the unsuspecting professor had handed these criminals a terrible weapon! It was sure to be misused and become an invention for destruction. No, that must not happen! There wasn't a moment to lose. I'd do everything possible to warn mankind before it was too late. DELIVER IMMEDIATELY TO THE PROFESSOR! Professor! Professor! One day I saw the submarine returning from another murderous voyage. I had no idea my balloon had reached its goal or that the pirates were bringing bad news to their commander. The latest technology once again informed Artigas that his ominous secret had been uncovered. Our submarine, Your Excellency. They fired on us as soon as we surfaced... but we had the luck of the devil. - Someone has betrayed me. - They will come for us. Good! We 'II give them a magnificent reception. Enough of this hide-and-seek. Accelerate shell production and position the Supergun on the coast. Impossible through the marine tunnel. Then dig a new tunnel through the rock, above the waterline, straight to the coast. Nothing will stop me. - A slight malfunction, Excellency. While the count did everything to use the destructive power of the professor's invention to carry out his diabolical crimes, the trusting scientist still naively hoped that his labors would be a boon to mankind. About that same time, I was graciously granted an audience. I was summoned by Mr. Serko... Artigas's court scientist, architect of Back Cup... and builder of the new tunnel that was to bring the Supergun to the coast. Mr. Serko, I implore you once more - I will not let you see the professor. Forget about that. Yes, yes. The problem must be fixed immediately! Why didn't you send out divers? What? They didn't return? Send out more! I will hear no talk of danger! The damaged cable must be repaired at once! Mr. Serko... if you'll allow me, I've worked underwater... and I do not fear danger. Very well. If you're serious, I welcome your assistance. At the bottom of the lagoon, you'll follow the cable to the problem. Two men will accompany you... to guarantee your safe return. I had little interest in the damaged cable, of course. I offered to help so that I could explore the tunnel, my only chance of escape. Look again! Take reinforcements! That man must be found, dead or alive! They didn't see me. It was now or never. Yes! That dark tunnel was my coveted path to freedom. Nothing. We found no trace of him. How much oxygen was he carrying? Half an hour's worth. That very day, in a display of determined resistance, the world had sent out an exploratory vanguard. You are among friends, sir. WORLD POWERS UNITE TO COMBAT INVENTION FOR DESTRUCTION We're safe in the tunnel. Any patrols will be in the harbor. Look there! You see that? - The pirates! - Lights out. Engines off. Forgive me. I didn't expect to find you here. I need your help. If you'll wait outside, I'll dress at once. Of course. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Mr. Hart. I'm the professor's assistant. A pleasure, Mr. Hart. I delivered your letter that same day. What did the professor say? I'm afraid I don't know. He made no reply? He never mentioned your letter. You may come in now. Warm yourself by the fire. You look like you need it. I don't know how you came to be in such company. These are not good people. They're planning a terrible crime. The people you speak of saved my life when our ship sank. You mean when they sank your ship to plunder it. They're now planning something much worse... that only the professor can prevent. It's regrettable that the count is busy. This is a very interesting and important experiment - Don't bother yourself, Professor. While you sat here, we found a better way to make use of your new energy. I'm afraid I've been of no help. We must find him at all costs. Tomorrow we can expect a full-scale attack by the fleet. We are ready, Your Excellency. Let the world's warships come this very minute! Let them try to attack! We have the upper hand! If you'll allow me, I'll outline my strategy. The plan is simple and guarantees us victory. Our Supergun controls the only approaches to the island. The entire encounter will last but seconds. Shells filled with the professor's new explosive will destroy every fleet before we're even in range of their guns. We shall learn their positions before they can even see us. From the crater we shall launch an observation balloon from which we shall receive advance reports. The balloon crew will be specially equipped. Kindly observe how perfectly the crew is outfitted. These men were chosen for their experience and special training. They will be linked to us via the latest telephone technology and the thinnest of cables. They will take up their position provisioned with food and water. Once the fleet has been sunk, they will guard our island against any further attempt at attack. I ask you now, Your Excellency... The ships are coming. We must warn them at once. If you're brave, I know a way. - And the professor? He can't help now. We must act. They're coming. Professor, have you come to observe...? Prepare the cannon. My dear count! Professor, we're putting your ideas into action. Shoot them down! THE END
