Did you pay Banos? Did you? Has he called you? He's tried, alright? What are you gonna do? Race two, Ballarat. That's your plan? Yes. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. Instead of going on about it, maybe you should put a buck or two yourself. Shit, answer it. Where are you? I'm driving. You're meant to be here. Yeah I know, I got stuck in traffic, alright? It's a bloody nightmare. I told you, I wrote it down for you. Yeah, I know, I'll be there. Tell Alex I'm nearby. You forgot, didn't you? No. Of course I didn't. Jimmy, I can't let you do this to him anymore. That's not what's happening here, OK? I'll see you soon. 10 minutes! Yep. We're gonna be late for work. We'll be five minutes late. What's Eva doing today, could she look after Alex? She's working a shift, she's got the kids booked into daycare. It's just impossible. Sorry. She looks really pissed off, Jimmy. What is wrong with you. I'm sorry I'm late, OK? I can't have it, alright Jimmy? Yeah, I said I'm sorry. I don't want to have to say this in front of Alex. Well then, don't. He didn't want to go with you today. What are you talking about, he's fine. He's not fine, Jimmy. I will get every cent back, I promise you. How? The dogs? The casino. If it's not that, it's blowing it on that stupid car. Just... Have a good day. Get his haircut, will you? He refuses to let me do it. Yeah. Please, get it cut. OK. And don't let him play on your phone all day. I can't get him off it. You wanna start it, mate? No. Come on, you gotta learn some day, eh? Come on. There you go. Now, you gotta pump it twice before you turn the key, alright? Good, turn it. Hey. It's good, huh? Give it some. Give it some more. There, good. Nice. Hey. We'll pick up something on the way, mate. I'm starving, you? Mm-hm. Steve, egg and bacon? It's gotta be quick. Al? I don't like Maccas. Why not? It's not very good for you. Yeah, I know mate, but it's quick. What do want, then? An olive bread stick. An olive bread stick, where the hell am I gonna get an olive bread stick from? There you go, mate. Thank you. Olive bread stick. So Alex, do you have a girlfriend? No. A boyfriend? Are you serious? It's OK, Jimmy, I'm just asking. What about that Charlotte girl? Um-mm. Alex, rock, paper, scissors? No, I'm OK. Come on, mate, you're not too old for it. B, I was just about to call you. It's school holidays you know, I'm running around like a blue ass fly. I've got something on that's gonna square this, I promise ya. It's happening today, B. Then what mate, what is it? I'll bring it into you, then. I want fifteen on my desk by the end of business today, do you understand that? Do you understand what I'm saying to you, mate? Yes. OK, I hear you, I do. Look, I gotta go. Is he coming? He will be. Why do you stick up for that bum? I'm pretty sure I still make the decisions around here or have you forgotten that? I think we should bring him in now. I don't pay you to think I pay you to do. Go do as I tell you and finish making my coffee. Oh come on Jimmy, not a disabled park. Let me worry about that, will ya? What shifty doctor did you get that from? One that appreciates cars. That's so disrespectful, Jimmy. What's disrespectful is people scratching my car. Stop trying to make me look bad in front of my kid, will ya? You shouldn't do it, Dad. Mate, when you love something this much, you'll understand, alright? Come on. Jim, where've you been. One of those mornings. This must be Alex. Mm-hm. He looks just like you. You better get going, he's not happy. You should have left 25 minutes ago. Yeah that orange flavored vodka. You have a big night, boys? Yeah, a little bit. Oi, you got anything on today? Nah, nothing on today. You always got something on today, Jim. You have a good run, ladies. Jump up there, don't touch anything, alright? Nothing. Jim. Jim! What? What's with the kid? What do you mean? You can't use our van if you're taking him with you. His name is Alex, Bill. We're not insured for Alex, so you can either go home or use your own car. I can't use my car, my car's a classic. I'm not using it for deliveries. I don't care what it is, work it out. Otherwise, I get a driver here to replace you, ASAP. Where are you going? I'll be right back. I'm docking your pay. Alex! Fucking miserable piece of shit, with his dumb red hair. I can't stand redheads, mate. It's one thing you'll learn. I should have stayed home. Where are we going? Just to a friend's Oh, I've got some biscuits. I hope you like these, they're my favorites. Cool. What do you say? Thank you. Mate, I gotta talk to Jenny for a second, OK? OK. He looks just like you. Yeah. I have to admit I'm a little surprised to see you. I've been so busy at work, I haven't been doing much at all. Hey, whatever happened with that fella? Nothing much. He doesn't know what he's got in front of him. That's a nice thing to say. You know, I've been meaning to ask you something. What do you mean? You come here and we talk about things. You leave and then you pop back up again. Is that a bad thing? No. Just can't work you out. I just like talking to you, you know? I know. But that means something, doesn't it? Yeah, it does but... I can't do this. I just, I need a favor. What is it? Could you look after him for the day? What about his mum? She can't, she's working. Please. OK. Thank you. I'm not staying here. Mate, it's just for a few hours. I'm not staying with your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. I'm not fucking staying here! Come here. Stop! Don't you ever talk to me like that again, OK? You're gonna hurt him, get off of him. You apologise, apologise to her, now! Just stop! That was unacceptable! I saw you kissing. She kissed me. I'm telling Mum. Mate, there is nothing to tell your mother, alright? Don't you dare tell your mother. I didn't do anything. You were going to leave me with her! Are you there, are you? No! You're here with me. Jesus, she's just a friend OK? OK? OK. I love your mother very much, mate. You got that? Yes. Yes. Whoa. How good's that. Twelve fifteen Just wait here, OK? What am I gonna do? Here, play this. Delivery, man. Excellent. Thank you. And just sign that. No probs. Al. Al, mate. Alex, open the door. Alex, can you please open the door? Alex! Alex! Alex, open the door! Open the door, Alex! Open the fucking door! Jesus. Really? Alex. Boobs. It's gonna be a good day, I promise. OK? OK. Two secs, mate, don't touch anything. Hey mate Cool, have a good day mate. You too mate Alex, get your hands out. Hello, mate. Hello. How are you, good? Good. You like peas? Yeah. You wanna try? Here. Thank you. Is everything alright, dear? Yeah. Hey, boy. You alright? Yeah. Doesn't look it. Why didn't you come last week. I told you, I had something on, I couldn't get out of it. But you promised. I know. I'm sorry, OK? Now, what's going on? Nothing. Al, come on, mate, tell me. What's going on? I can't sleep. You going to bed on time? I see a man. What? I see a man. Where? In my room What does he look like? I can't see his face but it scares me, so I can't sleep. I used to have bad dreams. When? When I was a kid. The doctor said I had an over active imagination. It didn't help though. What were you scared of? Vampires. I thought I was gonna be taking by vampires. I was so sure of it that I would practice being frozen so they'd think I was dead. And then your grandpa, he said to me: Vampires hated the sun. And that in my dreams, I should turn myself into the sun, and they would melt away. Did they? Yeah, they did. Where's Grandpa now? I don't know, mate. When did you last see him? When I was about your age. Good morning. Oh, is that my material? Feels soft. Is this your son? Yep. You know how many times I told your dad I'd make him a shirt. Next time, I promise. That's what he always says. What about me? Yeah, I can do that. Come on, mate, we gotta go. Actually, I got some spare on a roll. Can I? Honestly, I'm probably gonna throw it away. Really? Yeah. Can it be quick. Yeah. Just gonna do your arm now. Just relaxing. Just relax your elbow. Yep, there you go. Beautiful. Twenty one. Alright. You're done, my man. Al, can I have my phone? Just a second. Come on, mate, I gotta call Steve. Just a sec, OK, I need to finish this level. Hurry up, I can't keep him waiting. Just wait, OK? - Don't just wait, OK. - Give me the phone! Pick it up. I was in the middle of a game. Alex, can you please pick up the phone? You made me stuff it up! Yeah well, I asked you nicely. Couldn't you have just waited? Who's phone is it? Yours. Yes. Who's car is it? Grandpa's. No, it's mine, now pick up the goddamn phone! Jesus. Thank you. Hey, where are you? Well, hurry up or you'll miss it. Want a drink or something? No. You sure? Mm-hm. What are you playing? Run Zombies. Run Zombies, Jesus. Don't you have something else you can play with? Nope. Sammy, you got the cards, mate? Give me that. OK. I'm gonna show you a game, OK? You ever heard of black jack? - No. - No, alright. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over it. For example: that's fifteen, yeah? So kings, queens, jacks, they're all ten. Aces are either ones or elevens. So my suggestion is, you take another card. Yep. Good. Three, that's oh, that's eighteen. That's pretty good, that's nice. I gotta get over eighteen but under twenty one to win. Alright, so if I were you, I'd sit on that because you probably won't get a one, two or three with the next one, you understand? Yep, so can I have another card? Yeah, you can, but you'll probably go over twenty one. How do you know? Because the odds are against you, mate. But can I try? Yeah, you can try but we're not betting against anything real, you know? So you're not feeling the card, you gotta feel it. Imagine we're betting for that soccer ball that you love, would you take the card or leave it? What would happen if I went over twenty one? You lose the ball, mate. But I love that ball. Yeah. But what if I win? You get another one, a brand new one. So you want the card or not? Yep. Yeah. Mm-hm. You sure, 100%. Yep. You're in? Yep! Bum buuuum It's my ball now. Lucky we're not playing for real, huh? Mm-hm. You wanna play again? Yep. Have I missed it? No. Are you sure about this? 100 percent. How can you be so sure? I just know. OK well, how do you know? I mean there's like 20 horses up there. Jesus, are you trying to jinx me? There's never anything good as a dead set certainty, but this one here, this is as close as it gets, mate. So, are you sure? Are you gonna put any money on this or what? Yeah, seventy five, that's all I got. Are you serious? It's as much as I can afford to lose. Seventy five. Are you good? Yep. Do you need a hand? No. Alright. Big one's ours, mate. That a boy. Come on, eleven. Come on, Maddalena! Get out of there! Come on. Come on, Maddalena! Go, go. Go, you donkey, go! Wait. Wait. Wait. Now, kick it home! - Maddalena! - Maddalena! Yes, Maddalena! Oh, oh yes. Oh, you did it. Look at that. Go, Maddalena. Look at me. All good? Cashed it straight away. Fifteen to pay back my loan. And this four, this four thousand is for you, me and your mom. Yes. I still can't believe it. I told you, I told you, didn't I? Yeah I know Jimmy, I don't know what to say but, you know. At your service. I've got a few more rounds to do, right, and you've got to make that delivery, yeah? Yeah, absolutely. Come on, let's have something to eat first though, yeah? Mm-hm How about we just meet at the depot after work, right? And we can celebrate then, easy. Alright, done. Yeah alright, I'll see you later. Alright, see ya. And you, order anything you want, alright? Anything at all. I gotta make a quick call. Where are ya? I'm about to have a great big lunch. Have you lost your fucking mind? Yeah, bullshit mate. I got it in my hands right now. I'll send you a photo then. Ha ha. Ha ha. Jimmy, you listening? No photos. Jimmy! Jimmy. Fucking stupid. Well don't ever do that again. Now, when are you coming in? I'll be there about two. I told B, I told you, it's gonna be alright, mate. Yeah well, just get here, OK? Fuck. Just fucking get here Jimmy. She's out to twelves you know, she's my friend. I'm thinking of her at night and then, I'm sitting in some shit pub in Ballarat or wherever. And I read that she's racing again and I'm like fuck this! Fuck this shit, you owe me! You owe me, you little shit. And then suddenly, bang! I'm back, yes? Hey, I need to see ya. What did you win? Fourteen hundred. I need it. Jim, that money is already spent. I got bills, I gotta get new beds for the kids, I just can't do that to them. How about this, right? Give me a thousand, you keep the 400, I'll fix you up next week, I promise, mate. We're mates, right? Yes. I said I can't do that. If you ask me again, I'm not gonna wanna see you anymore. You understand? Do you have anything you can sell, like anything? Nup. I got nothing. Jimmy. I'm sorry for asking but I have to. I feel so stupid. Don't do that. It's how I feel. I'm sorry. I can't be this for you anymore. What? Someone that you would use. That's not what this is. Then how could you ask me something like that? 'Cause I fucked up. I think you should leave. Wow. It's a beauty. How many owners? Just two, me and my father. You're kidding. No. Bought her off the floor. Has it been in an accident, been re-sprayed or anything? No. No, it's totally original. No accident, not a bolt touched. Bullshit. Have it checked out. You know, this is how they want them these days, you know that? I didn't know. It's definitely one for collectors. So, you wanna buy it? Well, it's no good to the yard. Why don't you, ah, sell it privately? I gotta get rid of it today. What do you want? I don't know you'd be lucky to get one for under $35,000 now. Yeah, that's a little rich for me. Mate, I've serviced it myself. I've got the books, the papers, you will not see one like this again, I promise ya. Yep. I'll give you twenty. Twenty eight. Twenty two. Twenty six. Twenty five and that's my final offer. OK, I want it in cash. Cash? I'll need about 20 minutes to get it. OK. Alright. Brilliant. I'll get the paper work for the transfers. My wife's gonna kill me, you know. But my kids, will think I'm a bloody legend. Ha ha ha! Yeah! Hey, where are you going? We had a deal! No way, mate! No way, not for him! He was so angry! Ha, ha, ha, too bad! Yeah, too bad. There's always a way, mate. Always a way. He's late. I'm well aware of the time, Chris. Go to his house, if he's not there, go to his work. If you find him, bring him here. Alright. And if you don't find him straight away, just come back. I mean, who knows, he may just turn up. Hey, is Mel in? Can I ask your name? Yeah it's Jim, she knows me. Yeah, just one second. Hey love. I had no idea who she was talking about. Come here. I can't believe I'm looking at you. Same. This can't be who I think it is. Yep, he's grown. You know last time I saw you, I think you were this high. I reckon that would be about right. That can't be good. Kids change things, huh? Yeah, the party certainly stops. Yeah, they change stuff, that's for sure. How's that, um, beautiful woman of yours? [She's good. She's OK. You're still working on cars? I'm a courier now. That's different.

Hey Al, go and have a play with them for a sec mate. Yup. You're not a cop, are you Jimmy? Jesus, Mel. I haven't seen you in years and you just pop in. Mel, come on. No, I'm not a bloody cop, OK?
