There are two types of forgetting: passive and active. Passive forgetting is when you don't remember where you've put your keys in the morning. It's simple, uncomplicated. So what is active forgetting? Repression? Good. The different sons of repression come under three separate headings-- Amnesia, Neurosis, and Dissociation. Today we will concentrate on dissociation. The loss of one's identity and the role of the psychoanalyst. That was Haydn's second movement "Trio #26, Andante." Hello? Hello, Dr. Franks? This is Sister Harrison from St. Mary's Hospital. I'm afraid I'm calling with some bad news. Dad! Shh. Shh. There are considerable assets. Mm-hmm. And, uh, you'll take care of the funeral? Yes. I've started making the arrangements. In Genoa? No, in Melbourne. He stipulates he wants to be buried in Genoa. He has property there, doesn't he? And he's bought a plot. When did he buy a plot? Before he moved to Melbourne. When he found out about his condition, I expect. Have you made other arrangements? Well, it's just unexpected, that's all. It's a very important thing, wouldn't you say? One's last wish. Well, young Samuel. Snob school lets you home for the summer, does it? Sure he misses you, your dad, you know, with the house to himself and all. Thanks, Russ. Righto. Dad? Dad? Sam? I'm with a patient. You've lost your place. sorry? Oh, thank you. What does "S" stand for? Samuel. I'm Ruby. Excuse me. I'd like to have a word with you, about your cargo? Your father. okey'! - Excuse me. Eh, Samuel. Russ. Well, no use standing out here. I'll give youa lift in, eh? Thank you. Well, you certainly turned out. Headshrinker, eh? Yeah, you wouldn't find much left rattling around my lunch box. Staying long? No, just for the service. Piss off, Sam. Knew I'd find you here. It's our spot. When'd you get back? Just now. Had your hair cut? No. Got my ears lowered. Looks shocking. Yeah. Got all summer to grow it back, though. Come in for a swim? Don't tease. I'm not. You should take those things off. You'll get tan marks. What's that? It's poetry- Full of words. Can you hear them? - Come on. - What? I've got something to show you. 'Kay, stop here. See there? Wow, Sil. A rock. Lift it up. I found it. Where? There, just like that. Who do you think did it? I don't know. Maybe it was someone's pet. It's huge. Leave it. Don't touch it. It's romantic. If Mrs. Sacks catches you, you're dead. What's she going to do, beat me up? She's a witch, you know? She's old, that's all. - mad. She probably killed the bird. Whoa! Sam? Yeah? I was starting to worry. Where have you been? Just walking around. What are you doing? dont just passing the time. It won't keep still long enough. What won't? My subject. Christmas beetle. Saw a dead bird today. Someone buried it under a rock. Must have meant a lot to someone. It was all neat and cleared around the rock, like they came to visit it or something. Like they couldn't just forget about it. What? What are you talking about? Good night. Yes, good night. "Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me "all the days of my life "and I shall dwellin the House of the Lord forever." Walk. Run. Down. Feather. Cap. Hat. Rack. Stack. Crash. Landing. Strip. Poker. Face. Paint. Draw. Blood. Red. Raw. Steak. Meat. Ax. Pick. - Choose. - Win. - Gain. - Weight. - Rest. - Still. - Water. - Bottle. Green. Sleeves. Sleeves? Yeah, "Greensleeves," the song. Oh. Ha, I won. Sam. Hello, Mr. Lewis, sir. Sent you packing, have they? Yes, sir. Well, what have you two been up to? Oh, the usual. Broke a few windows, let down a few tires, you know. Oh, well, as long as you're staying out of trouble. Well! It's Sam! Sam was just asking if he could stay for dinner. Dad. Of course he can. Well, have you got a kiss for me, mother? Oh, Christ, Maurie, you stink to high heaven. What have you been doing, rolling in it? It's good for a man to come home smelling of manure. It reminds him of his origins. Don't you agree, Sam? Yes, sir. You'll be going to the town dance, eh, son? I guess. You'll need a partner then? Maurie, people don't have partners these days. Silvy, have you found a partner yet? Personally, I don't care for dancing. Help me with this, Silvy. Dorothy, sit down and enjoy the evening. How would you like to earn some pocket money? I could do with a bit of a hand around here. Just a few chores. Won't take up all of your time. okey'! - She's been uncomfortable for days now. Right, Sam. Come on, the wool. Wool's best that doesn't cut. Right. Pull the wool. Pull it! Come on, keep it tight! Keep it tight! Come on, it's not over yet. All right. Round you come and see the bairn. That's a bonny girl. Come on, round you come. Here we go. Feel a bit queasy? No shame. Breathe it in. Perfectly natural. No shame. Most people like to hide from things. That retards the growth of the spirit and pretty soon their mortal ears can't hear the soul flapping its wings, wanting to fly in the face of life. To dare! You understand? Well, you'll never be quite alive until you do. Better get back. If moths are attracted to light, then why don't they come out during the day? Because during the day, light comes to them. Who told you that? I don't know. So you just made it up? No, I suppose I thought about it just then. Is that like a boy thing? What? Being able to bullshit like that? Maybe. Everything's asleep. They say people can meet each other in their sleep. In their dreams. Then meet me tonight. We'll compare dreams. Breathe. "Let us go then, you and I. What? It's poetry- You want to go? Where? Anywhere. Shh. Stop. Listen. It's so still. You can smell things better when it's quiet. Close your eyes. what can you smell? The tar on the road. It's still warm. What else? The river. What else? Your hair. You say a word and then I'll say a word and we'll make a sentence. You start I--- want... something... Come on, Sil. Something... I want something. okey'! - "I... want... something..." to... happen... tonight. You all right? Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. Can I help you? I think you should lie back down. Make a fist for me. Please. Are you the doctor? Yes... son of. Make a fist. Good. Wiggle your toes. Is this a hospital? No. Wiggle your toes. Where are my shoes? Look up. I couldn't find them. Just relax. Look down. What do you feel? Nothing. Well, you're fine. Just stood up too quickly. Still a little unsteady on your feet. How long have I been here? Just the night. Something happened. Something bad. Yes, you had an accident. Did someone die? No. No, nothing like that. I know you. We met on the train. Remember the train? Do you remember the bridge? No... The water... You remember the water? Yes. Why am I here? Well, I brought you here. I passed you on the bridge. You were by yourself. I helped you out of the water. You fell. You should just rest. You're a little concussed. It's not unusual after an accident. You should try and drink some of this. I'm not thirsty. I suppose you've drunk enough water for one day. Is it morning? You slept all morning, I'm afraid. What does "S" stand for? What? Dr. S. Franks. We've had this conversation... on the train. Oh. When I woke up, the book looked familiar, thought that maybe I was S You don't know your name? You told me on the train. You said it was Ruby. Is that your name? Is that it? What? Is that your name? Ruby? Hmm. Uh... I'm cold. Perhaps you should get back under the covers. Yes. I should get back under. Just try to relax. Things will return. If this continues, I can try something. Or I could give you an injection. An injection? Sodium amyial. It jogs the memory. I hate needles. There, you've remembered something about yourself. You're very kind. Very kind. Watch it. What are you whispering for? She's deaf. What's she doing? She's asleep. She's dreaming. She talks in her sleep. Let's go. Wonder what she was dreaming about? Maybe her husband. He was probably the only one who understood her. She looked sad. There she is. Who? The Lady of The Lake. What are you talking about? Look at the moon's reflection long enough your eyes see a ballerina twirling. Can you see her? Sam, please. Shh. Shall we dance? what do you feel? It's cold. Relax. Hold me. I couldn't sleep anymore. I'm sorry, but I woke up starving. Is anything clearer yet? How do you feel otherwise? Can't seem to get full. Well, I'll get you some food. I know I know things. It's just I can't remember them. It's best when I don't think about it. It's like I'm in that dream where you can't wake yourself. You know that feeling? I don't dream. You live here by yourself? No. No one lives here. I mean, I live alone somewhere else. Whose place is this? Mine, son of. This is mine. You don't seem so sure about that. Well, I'm selling it. Why? Don't know what else to do with it. It's a nice house. If I lived here, I'd take down those curtains, though. Looks like they're trying to hide something, or keep something out. I think you're the first dinner guest this house has ever had. Not much of meal, though, I'm afraid. I'm not much of a guest. I mean, you can't really send me home, can you? I forgot for a moment. That's stupid-- forgetting that you can't remember anything. You must think I'm crazy. I just think you need some help, that's all. I think I could help you. I'd like to. Where are you going? I need to walk. How do people forget things? Sometimes it's purely physical, like a bump on the head. And other times? Some things are too unpleasant to remember. I see. I'm sorry. No. At least I don't know what to regret. Do you have regrets? Enough. What do you do about them? I don't know that there's anything you can do about them. That's why they're regrets. If you could? That would be wishing. Did you know it takes hundreds of years for the light from stars to reach us? They mightn't even be there right now and we don't know. They might have died hundreds of years ago and we still see them. Just like we're watching history. We're seeing something which happened when Galileo was alive or Cleopatra. Do you think other people are like us? Probably not. Sam? Yeah? Nothing. Did you see that? Quick, make a wish. How can I be helped? Hypnosis. They call it narcotherapy these days, but it's hypnosis. I put you to sleep, and ask you some questions. When you wake up, you probably won't remember what you said, but I'll have a good idea how to help you. It's a shortcut, but it may do the trick. What other tricks do you play on your patients? Tricks? Games, then. Word games. Word asso... -Associations. Exactly. Precisely. I didn't realize we'd started. I'm fast. Quick. Dead. I thought you weren't meant to think about it. Life. Love. Head. Beat. Drum. Stick. Bat. Ball. Cry. Weep. Blink. Wink. Nod. Sleep. Doze. Dream. Blank. Check. cross Church. God. Man. - Adam. - Eve. Night. Moon. Star. Wish. Burn. Dry. Dust. Did. Death. - Wish. - Well. Wish. - Water. - Splash. Color. Red. Blue. Green. Sleeves. Cuff. Stop. Start No, stop. That's enough. What are you thinking? Something foolish. You don't seem to be the son of person to entertain foolish thoughts. I try not to. Didn't say that was a good thing. So... how'd I go? I'm sorry. It's just an exercise ... a game. Is there a word for that? What? The moon's reflection on the water. Don't think so. Something so beautiful should have a name. Yes, it should. It's like the moon's shadow, isn't it? It's light, though. Not shadow. Moths only live a few hours, don't they? It's probably why they flap around so much. What would you do if you were a moth? Panic. You're a strange man. What did you mean when you said you don't dream? Just that. It's common for analysts not to dream. The unconscious doesn't like being found out. But you dreamed when you were younger. Yes. I think you do dream. You just don't remember them. Wodash. "Shadow" backwards. Wodash , shadow. Wodash, shadow, wodash. See? We've given it a name. You know, if you stare at it long enough, you'll see a woman dancing. Spinning. Perhaps we should go back. Come on. We should go back. Do you hear that? What? Listen. It's a waltz. What are you doing? - Take your shoes off. - What? - Take off your shoes. - No. Let's go. Let us go then, you and I. What's that from? It... Is it from something? It's a poem by T.S. Eliot. It's very well known. "Let us go then, you and I "When the evening is spread out against the sky Like..." "Like a patient..." "Etherized upon a table "There will be time, there will be time To wonder, 'Do I dare?"' "Do I dare?" What son of a kid were you? I wouldn't want to bore you. Make something up, then. When people try to make things up it always ends up being the truth. They can't help themselves. Well, tell me what I was like, then. Happy-go-lucky. Was I fat? No, never fat. Skinny, with a long neck. Like a giraffe? Well, until you grew into it. And thin wrists. Oh. What else? Oh... you were always up to something. Mischief. Yeah. Yes, I liked mischief. As long as it led to something. As long as it led to more mischief. Did I have lots of boyfriends? No. You scared them all off. You were always talking over their heads. Misunderstood. Yes. But someone liked me, right? Sure. My true love. Mm, your true love. How come I never married? Come on. What's wrong? Nothing. I want you to stare at the flame of the candle. Look at its brightest pad. Concentrate on just that. Soon I will ask you some things, but for now, just look into the candle. When I count one, you will close your eyes and continue to see the candle in your mind. When I count two, you will open them and see the candle again. I will count three, you'll close your eyes and feel yourself start to drift and relax. You will hear only my voice. Let us begin. Close your eyes, see the candle. Two. Open them. Stare at the flame. Three. See the candle in your mind. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Drift and relax. Eight. Nine. Ten. You hear only my voice. What can you see? I'm drifting. Tell me what you see. I'm... I'm cold. You're no longer cold. Tell me what you see. I'm... I'm beautiful. You see yourself? Yes. In a mirror? Like... like a mirror. And what is your name? Mmm... like... Ophelia. Your name is...? I'm beautiful like Ophelia. What is your name? Mmm... you know my name. Tell me again. You haven't forgotten. I want you to answer me simply. Fine. How old are you now? Mmm. I won't get any older. Speak only the truth. I do. Where are you? Moving fast. Where are you? I'm right here. Who's with me? Who is with you? Now he's gone. He's left me. Who? Gone. Gone now. I want you to think of the bridge. What happened before the bridge? I'm wet. What can you see? A woman. She'll... she'll... she'll jump. She'll jump! She... What happened? She did it. It's cold. I want you to go back further. Before that. Before the bridge. It's dark. What can you see? I'm going- - Where? - Fast. - Where? - Um... Along the bottom. I'm... I'm moving fast along the bottom. Go back before the bridge. No, I am... - Who are you? - You know. Breathe. Breathe. Mmm... can't help it. I've done it. I've ta... I've taken it in. What? The water. No. No, you're fine. I'm filling up with water. No, you're fine. You're here and you're fine. Quick, make a wish. I'm fine. Yes. It feels good. Warm. And full of water. Sil? I want you to come back. I can't come back. You'll start to come back. He's... he's calling me. Who? His voice. I want you to come back. He wants me to. I... I can hear his voice. Silvia? Oh, his hand. Whose hand? He let go. I'm moving fast. I grabbed your hand. Let go. I grabbed you. Stop. Stop. I want you to stop. There. There I am. I see me. There you are. Who? You. It's you. You're scared, you can't see me. I will count to five and you will return. - You're scared. - One... You can't see me. Two... Gone. - Three. - I've gone. Four... I loved you. Come in. Where's Silvy? Sorry, Maurie, there's nothing. Even if she did drown, the current would take her downstream to one of those underwater caves. Let him go. Anything turns up, we'll get him back in again. Genoa Police. Sergeant Briggs. Dad. I went for a walk. Didn't want awake you. Borrowed this. Strange how something can start here and end up somewhere at the bottom of an ocean, underneath all that... that silence. I want to show you something. Is that you? It is. Or it was. There was a boy... What happened? And there was a girl. Things were different... more... beautiful when he was with her. She was quite beatific. Then something happened and... something in the boy fell away. Go on. I don't think I can walk anymore. Please take me home. All right. My home. See that... that book on the top? Yes. Could you bring it here? Read me the last verse. "We have lingered in the chambers of the sea "while sea-girls wreathed in seaweed red and brown till human voices wake us, and we drown." Say something. After you died... when it was obvious you wouldn't come back, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to be, so... so I just didn't. A young man made a choice to never react, never be surprised. I never meant to be that man. I'm afraid I still don't know what to do. I think perhaps you might have to tell me. Silvy. Speed bonny boat Like a bird on the wing, over the sea to sky Carry the lad That's born to be King... When I was a wee boy... and I had a pain my mammy used to say, "That's your bones growing." Growing pains. Well, it's the same with the spirit. I could use a hand here, Sam. Will you join me?
