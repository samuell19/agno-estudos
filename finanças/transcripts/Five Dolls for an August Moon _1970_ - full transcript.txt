Let's play a game, shall we? The rope. The rope is very important. We're going to sacrifice a girl from the tribe to appease the god Baag. Our most beautiful virgin, I imagine. The god Baag doesn't care about these details. Come on, dance. - Are you going to kill me? - Of course, after some serious torture. Really, George? Darling, the god Baag and I have never disappointed a lady. So that's what the god Baag is. Jacques. There it is! Now serve all our guests. George, why have you got that razor? - You'll see. - George! Not like that, George. Please. You're really hurting me. George! It'll only take a minute. And your husband's here. What are you afraid of? We're all very fond of you. We chose you out of the whole tribe. But I'm afraid, George. Untie me, please. Too late. It's already been decided. - Great Baag, do you want this woman? - George, let me go! I give you her life, her heart, her blood, great Baag. No, George. George! Come, friends, and do with her as you will, in the worst possible way. What have you done? Jack, where are you? Jack? Silence! Silence! Behold the purifying flame coming towards you all. Make yourself ready, sinner. Behold... Nobody move. Who was it? Who had that dagger? Doesn't anyone remember? I had it, but somebody took it from me in the dark. - You don't know who it was? - I know very well who it was. Who? Go on. I'm not talking, George. The guilty person will talk. - Are they going away? - Who? Them. Can't you see? The sailors and the yacht. They can go to hell as far as I'm concerned. But I'll have to serve everyone by myself. Serve me, darling. They're so demanding. A houseboy is like a second mother for people like them. Why don't you leave? We'll employ you, Jacques. What is this mysterious meeting? Nothing, just business. Why aren't you more affectionate, Mummy? Come on, hold me. Jacques. Sometimes it's really hard to understand my George. Why would he send the yacht away? Not to buy food, that's for sure. I mean, we're on an island. Sure. One of us could fall ill. - Not much chance of that. - No one falls ill in our house. George's orders. George's orders! But there's something about this island that I don't like. I'm hardly ever wrong. Trudy, did you hear poor Peggy? She doesn't like the island. We'll have to change it. No, I'm talking about this mysterious business meeting. When are you going to do a show? I did one a month ago. George set it up. - How could you marry a beast like that? - All men are beasts. But there's something about him when he writes a cheque. So you married him for money? 20 billion lire. I'd have married my grandfather for that. I'm done. When are they coming down? Hi, Isabel. Do you like daisies? There are lots on the other side of the island. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Why don't you help us out in the kitchen? - Me, in the kitchen? No way! Aren't you afraid, going round the island on your own? No. I think my father will be back soon, with my mother. - Maybe even tomorrow. - Really? Her operation was a while ago now. That's enough, Professor. We want to buy. You can name your price and take the first million dollars now. In fact, seeing as we're in this together, we can each give you a million. I've always said I don't care about the money. I just came here to rest. We've each got a cheque for a million dollars in our pocket. - From a Swiss bank, made out to cash. - It's a down payment. You can cash them whenever you want. Three million dollars. I'm just not interested in money. Why don't you listen to us for once? We want your formula. Don't you want to sell it after all this time? I don't know yet. I need to give it some more thought. Try to understand. My best friend was killed because of these experiments. That has nothing to do with your formula. - What about my conscience? - Your conscience? Don't be ridiculous! You want your name in the history books. And you'll have it. The discovery's still yours. Do you want me to throw my wife in too, Mr Scientist? That's enough! I want to get off this island. Come on, think about it. Why did you send the yacht away? Because the sea looks stormy and there's nowhere to moor a boat that big. Well, Jacques can take me back tomorrow on the motorboat. My wife said this was supposed to be a holiday! Come on, Trudy. Help me. He'd never say no to you. You're wrong. He doesn't change his mind unless he wants to. He's one of a kind. - That's why I married him. - Right. He's also a great scientist, but yours truly isn't going to give up. I want your formula and I'll buy it from you at any price. Can't you understand that a scientist might want to work for humanity, not for millions of dollars? We industrialists work for humanity too. We sell things but don't get sentimental. He doesn't sell, he gives. There's a big convention in Geneva on Monday. He's going to speak there. Look, you'd better not do anything stupid because the three of us don't want to give up on the deal. Is that a threat? - What do you want? - I've come to get Trudy. We're going for a walk. You don't need me to stay here, do you, darling? No, you can go. Thanks. I won't be long. Bye. I just wanted to warn you. I didn't know it would have bothered you so much. I wouldn't even have got married if I'd known, Trudy. Really? Sorry, but I don't believe you. You could always get divorced, you know. There's no point. What do you care about him? I just can't believe you married somebody who could take you away. No, Trudy. Never. Never, I swear to you. We'll see. Look, Pook's off to see her Jacques, the houseboy. - Where? I can't see her. - There, on the motorboat. Jacques? Can you hear me? Jacques. Darling. Jacques. Jacques. Jacques, don't you feel well? Jacques? - What was I telling you? - That I'm a dirty slut. That's why I'm having a shower. At least I'll be a clean slut. Then you asked how I could sleep with a houseboy. We have to do something for the working class, don't we, darling? Anyway, you were saying that you have a very bad wife. You can carry on where you left off. Look, Jacques is just a houseboy. As far as I'm concerned, it's a question of taste. Why Jacques, when there are much better options? - Have I ever been jealous? - I don't know what the hell you mean. I mean did you really have to waste yourself on a houseboy? I'm not wasting myself. I need to do something with my time. - Look, I think... - Darling, I'm not asking you to think. I'm asking you to do something. What the hell do you want me to do? Well, a wife can help her husband. Tell me how. What you did with that houseboy could help convince the professor. Which one of us is the slut? A question of taste! If you think helping my husband means cuckolding you, you can count on me. I'll help you with all the friends I can find, OK? OK. Start with George. No... Don't stay here. Come with me, let's go back inside. Come on. Who could it have been? No, we can't touch him until the police get here. Yes, I know. Really? Have a look. If we don't take him away, the crabs will deal with him. Are we just going to leave a skeleton for the police? Oh, no. Poor Jacques. So you killed him? I still can't work out whether you're dangerous or just stupid. My dear husband, have you forgotten that I like my men alive? Hello? Hey! It's no use, Professor. Save your breath. There must be a fault on the line. What are you yelling about? George, did you cut off the radio phone? No, it was working earlier. Hello? Hello? Didn't you want me to call the police? As if I'm afraid of the police. Right. You're the big man that nobody dares to touch. I'm getting out of here right now. I'm taking the motor boat. Come here! Wait, Professor. Where do you think you're going? You can't leave. - It's gone. - What's gone? The motor boat. You sent it away like the yacht. I didn't send the motor boat away. Help me look for it. Where could it be? The first ever attempt to freeze a houseboy. Jill, stop crying now. You've got to forget about it. It's all over. Come on. Stop it, Jill. That's enough. You stop it. Just leave me alone. Jill, you can't carry on like this. You can't just keep crying. Come on. - Shall we have a drink? - Not for me, thanks. Houseboys come and go but we'll always have bottles. Here. Death makes me thirsty. Please, Jill. Try to calm down. Death makes you feel dirty. Oh, sweetheart. You can't carry on like this. I want to get a bit of air. - That's a good idea. - I'm going to have a shower. Please stop now. You're crying like a little girl throwing a tantrum. - Do it for me. - That's enough now. Stop it. I don't know what you're up to, George, but I know you could do anything... Stop it, you idiot! Shut up! That's enough! You deal with her, Trudy. You know how to handle women. I'll make him pay for this, Trudy, I swear. Jill... Listen to me, sweetheart. Please listen to me. You keep on talking, but don't you know that a woman must never talk? A woman can even kill a man but she mustn't talk about it, all right? Of course, darling, that's what we'll do. We'll leave together, whenever you want. Hold on a minute. Just a minute. Come in. I was thinking... Till now, all we've clone is talk. Here's a million dollars. If you deal with me alone, I'll pay you five million more and no one will know about it. You're wasting your time. I'm not selling my formula. Don't decide now. Think about it. If you want to cash it, you just have to say 2-2-3-3-3. That's the account number. - Who is this from? - Nick. - So you're selling? - No. I'm giving it straight back to him. Nick, take it back. I don't want it. - You should think about it. - There's no need. Wait. Anything could happen. I'm leaving it here for you. Isabel! What's all this about? Give me that scarf right now. It's mine. Sure, I'll give it to you. Hold on. Where are you going? Come here. - No. Go away. Leave me alone. - Didn't you say it was yours? - Yes. - Go on, then. - Take it. Are you afraid? - Thanks. - Now tell me what this is all about. - Let me go! Ah, Professor. What are you doing here? I came to tell you that your cheque's in your room. There you go. Oh, Professor, you scientists are such brainboxes. You refuse to sell your formula and make a fortune and you leave a million dollars lying around like a roll of toilet paper. Wake up, my friend, and listen to me. A million dollars? Wow! What's your formula for? An atomic bomb? No. It's a new type of industrial resin. You're so different from the others. - Which others? - Everybody. Have you ever thought about how much you could buy with a million dollars? A lot of things. - What's your name? - Isabel. But don't think it would buy you everything. Do the maths, Professor. Once you've bought a yacht, a couple of Rolls-Royces and a villa with a big garden, your million dollars has gone. What do you do then, Professor? Another formula. Ah, Trudy, the beautiful ice maiden. - Do you want some? - No. Well, I do. I want it all, right down to the last drop. All gone. Now for something else. You know what, Trudy? This is the best formula your husband's ever come up with. You're a hot, passionate woman. Right, Trudy? Trudy, a man like me and a woman like you. My hand on your skin. Can't you feel it, Trudy? It's as if I've always been looking for you, as if I was... You don't get it. You're crazy. There's been a murder, we don't know who did it and you want me to be calm. We can't just sit here talking. Listen, I don't care about the six million dollars that Nick wants to give me. Oh, yes, I forgot. I've already sealed the deal and given him the first million up front. He's sold to my group. That wasn't what we agreed. I know, but you didn't actually think we'd play fair, did you? The deal's done. You know very well I gave the cheque back to you, Nick. I didn't find it. The last thing I was expecting was a visit from you. - Where's the cheque? - The cheque? I left it here earlier. On top of your bra... the one you're wearing. A cheque in my bra? That's so sweet. See if you can find it. Go on, have a look. You're sure to find something nice. Jack... I'm really frightened. I'm sorry but I just can't help it. Are you sure we can't call the police? That's what they're all saying. But we've got nothing to hide. Sure, but I can't get poor Jacques out of my mind. I feel like something's about to happen. Do you know what it is? Try and guess. But only if you want to. If he doesn't hand over the formula, I'll have to... They're all asleep. Trudy, I've got laboratory results... It will revolutionise the market. I'm sorry, but if I can't get the formula... Too bad, Nick. You want to play dirty all the way, don't you? If you did it my way and made a deal with me, and there's still time, it would be better. Better for you, I mean. Who are you trying to frighten? We're the same. We're cut from the same cloth. We're two filthy swine from the same mould, George. Never forget that, all right? Jill. - Oh, Trudy. I didn't see you and... - And? Well, I was a bit frightened. I very rarely stand anyone up. You're so silly. Why does everything frighten you? All evening I've been thinking that there's a murderer among us. It feels like everybody's waiting for something that's never going to happen. Look, the person who killed Jacques may kill again. Who could it be, Trudy? Don't think about it now, Jill. Let's try to forget this nasty business, at least for a while, OK? Yes, of course. I'm sorry. I want to show you somewhere really beautiful. - Gunshot! - Where? Behind that rock. Quick! Fritz! Fritz! - He's dead, Jill. - Did you hear that? Up there! Quick, let's warn the others. Nick! George! Come here! Fritz has been killed. - He's been shot. - Hurry up! Quickly! Somebody dragged him into the sea. Why? Because they hope his body won't be found. Are you sure you haven't made a mistake? Of course. I saw him clearly. He was dead. And Jill was there too. I believe you. But it's strange. If you throw a body into the sea, you try to cover your tracks. What do you mean by that? I mean that whoever killed him was in a hell of a hurry. Come on, let's go back. I'm scared to stay here. A hurry to do what? To get back to the house and be found in bed like everybody else. You mean it was one of us? Without the slightest doubt. - What do you want? - Nothing. - We just want you to spill the beans. - What? We think you might know where the formula's hidden. I don't. He never told me anything. Not even where he put my cheque for a million dollars? When I went out he was in bed, but one of you woke him up and took him outside. That person needs to be found. If you were in bed, why did you go out? - Why did you meet Jill? - It's none of your business. Isn't it? I left a million dollars here on the table and you're going to give it back. If anybody else wants to try, I'm ready. Peg, have you had breakfast yet? Peg, what's the sea like this morning? Is it calm? I'm going to take you out and drown you. That'll teach you to answer me. Right, Peg? Peg! One by one we're going to end up here in the freezer. - Right, George? - What's your problem? Why her? Go on, tell me. Why did you want her to come with me? What has she done to you? If you don't talk I'll kill you. Murderers kill. Jack! Jack! Jack, where are you? Jack! Answer me! Where are you? Jack! Jack! - Jack! - Where are you hiding? Jack, answer me! Where are you? Jack! Jack! Isabel, have you seen Jack by any chance? - Do you want something to drink? - No. Maybe later. Look! Oh, God! Him too. Where were you hiding? - Here he is, George. - We looked everywhere for you. Where's Pook? Spraying soda water won't work this time. What's the matter with you? I can't stay here any longer. You must let me go, George. - I'm afraid of all of you. - Even me? I don't feel I ever really got to know you. There must be a way of getting off this cursed island, mustn't there, George? But you didn't want that. You kept us all here. Why, George? You know the professor would still be alive, and Peggy and Jacques. And that poor girl, the last one. It wasn't me who killed them, you know. No, it could have been you. What? That's enough. You can think what you like. I can't take this anymore! I can't take this anymore... Nick, what on earth are you doing? Nothing. I'm just looking for my cheque. Really? And you're looking for it in my desk? What are you doing? Why did you stop the record? What's got into you? I want my voice to stay around, if nothing else. My name's Trudy Larson. My husband was killed today by one of these three people. The first one is George Sagan, who invited us all here. The second one is Jack Davidson. I believe he's in business with George Sagan, who arranged this meeting. The third person's name is Nick Chaney. He could be another one of George Sagan's business associates. One of these three men... We're all a bit worked up. - Shouldn't we all go to bed? - No, I don't think so. Why not, George? Is this another one of your brilliant ideas? What is it? We sleep here. All four of us. - You think so? - I think that sounds very dangerous. Knight... bishop... queen. Checkmate. - But also very convenient. - Very convenient. Don't you agree? That way the murderer will kill us all. I'm not playing. He won't find me. - Nick! - Let him go, George. He's drunk. And if he wants to risk his life it's up to him. - Nick has gone out. - Trudy, are you starting that again? The other two are still here with me. She's obsessed. Each person can keep an eye on the others. If the murderer is among us and makes a wrong move... He won't. ...we'll find out who he is at last. Will you stop that? It's getting on my nerves. Let's try not to think about it. I've mixed an amazing drink for you. This will drive us all insane. Trudy, you come over here too. The three of us can keep each other company. That's strange. There's nobody here. You two, take a look upstairs. How could they have got off the island? It's not possible. Unless some friends came to pick them up. You could be right. They're not here. There's nobody there, Captain. It's very strange. Well, we might as well go. Hey, Jack. Jack. My head's killing me. Do you two feel all right? George? We've been drugged. Yes, there must have been something in the cocktail. There can't have been. I made it myself. If it wasn't you, who else could have done it? Who put the drug in our glasses? It could have been any one of us. But why? Maybe they meant to kill us but didn't put enough in. - Who could it have been? - One of us, that's for sure. We're all here except... except Nick. - Strangely enough we're still alive. - At least until now. Shall we take bets on who dies first? The dead person wins. The yacht should be here already. It'll only be a couple of hours. That's strange. There's nobody here. You two, take a look upstairs. Right away, Captain. How could they have got off the island? It's not possible. Unless some friends came to pick them up. You could be right. There's nobody there, Captain. It's very strange. Well, we might as well go. - What happened? - It's very simple. We fall asleep and it carries on recording. - And they didn't see us. - Right. It seems ridiculous. It's not ridiculous, it's impossible. We were here. Evidently we weren't. What? Do you want us to go crazy? That's your game, is it? Why don't you kill us like the others? You're the crazy one and I was blind not to realise it earlier. But that's it now. The game's up. Well! That's a very interesting point of view. I must confess I'd underestimated you, my dear Trudy. Really? Why? Do you think it was me, just like Jack does? Sit down, Trudy. It doesn't matter what I think. I'm not a man of thought, I'm a man of action. Take this, my dear. It's my million dollars. I don't think you're crazy. And money's important. Right, Trudy? Very important. I see you're pretty clever, George. Do you want me to help you? Wait for me here. All right. I trust you. Damn it! It won't start. - Trudy? Jack? Where are you? I found... - That's bad. I saw what you found, and it will cost you dearly. I'd have spared you otherwise, you know. Stay there, you idiot. I'm the one who got rid of the motorboat. And the radio phone. And you killed Nick. How did you do it? While you and Trudy were asleep, of course. But we were all drugged. I only put the sleeping pills in your glasses. Why? So that when your men came they wouldn't find you and they'd think you'd left. How will you get away with it? Where will you put the bodies? I'll hide them in the launch, then I'll sink it and swim away. They'll find it, Jack. The sea's very deep and I've no other choice. Why? You said you didn't want to kill me. That was my original plan, not to kill you so you'd get the blame for everything. - You did kill the professor, after all. - Me? What makes you think that? - I killed the others, but not him. - Nor did I. - I don't believe you, George. - What about your wife? She had to be killed too. She knew too much. Leaving witnesses behind is bad for your health. Trudy? Is that you? You can come in, Jack. You're not afraid, I hope. I'm unarmed, as you can see. I heard that you don't like leaving witnesses behind, which worries me. You also killed the professor, which wasn't part of our agreement. I didn't kill your husband. So if it wasn't George, you must have killed him. Me? Why would I have done it? I don't know. There are lots of things you don't know. Lots of things. But I know that you can't shoot me. Only I know where the formula is hidden. You find that very interesting, don%you? There's nothing you can do except stick to our bargain. Just like you have? You've pocketed two cheques and you want mine in exchange for the formula. - That's right, Jack. - OK. Come with me. For all these reasons, the court finds you guilty of the death of your friend Professor Kruger, whom you killed with the despicable intent of stealing the formula for one of his valuable discoveries, and sentences you to death by hanging. You're probably surprised that I'm here. You can't imagine how much I've loved you. I'll never love anybody else that way. Looking into your sweet, vulnerable eyes that first time was enough. I even loved you after I found out you'd killed your colleague for his formula. You believe me, don't you? But... I'm not judging you, you know. You're the only man I've loved. Really loved. I don't want this to sound like I'm telling you off, but why the Pentothal darts? And all those other Pentothal injections? That's what did for me. My father uses it with animals so they don't die. Pentothal makes you talk. When the police arrived, you told them what you'd clone to your colleague. It was a real stroke of bad luck. How could I have known that? When my father shoots animals with those darts, they sleep in peace and don't talk. I thought I could save you. They wanted to kill you, you know. - Thank you. - Don't mention it. You know, maybe you... Maybe I what? You could help me. I'm completely broke. You've spent three million dollars? No, just two. You know... Come closer. I cashed George and Jack's cheques. Nick's is the problem. I'd cash it if you could tell me the account number. You have to give it to the cashier. It's a very simple number. 2-2-3-3-3. Oh, Fritz, I love you! I'll pray for you, my love, I swear. Girl, stay with me You don't know what tomorrow will bring If you have a dream, leave it here For me, for me Girl, stay with me It's gonna be a long day And nothing's gonna be left here For us, for us You'll wake up once more You'll wake once more, with me, with me - Let's go to Lausanne. - Yes, madam. Girl, stay with me It's gonna be a long day And nothing else is gonna be left For us, for us Girl, stay with me The world is running away, let it go And then at night you will stay With me, with me
