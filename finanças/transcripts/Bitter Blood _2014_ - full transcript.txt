Subtitles by DramaFever [Year 2002] - Hello? - Ow... Did you get shot? I will be right there. I think this is it for me. Your wife and daughter are waiting for you to come home. Take care of your family for me. Enough, don't talk anymore. Hey, run. Senpai, you always say I shouldn't show my back to the enemy. You say it's nonsense. Don't be reckless. We are partners, aren't we? I don't want to put you to shame, Shimao-senpai. Hey, Maeda. Maeda. Will Team Japan be able to advance to the next level? That's the latest news on Zac Japan team. - Today is April 1st, isn't it, Kato-san? - Yes. - I'm sure you will meet many rookies today... - Rookies... We had those days too. They bring back memories of the company's welcoming ceremony. - Ceremony? - Feels like yesterday? Wait, it's been a while since then, Kato-san. - I'm not like you, Karube-san. - Really? You see many newly employed people in April. Oh shoot. Oh no... Hmm? - Shinobu? - Big brother! I'm sorry. - Why are you here? - I just arrived here on a night bus. But you won't have the school's entrance ceremony for a while, right? I wanted to sightsee Tokyo for a while. Sightsee? Then why don't you stay at a hotel? I can't ask Grandpa for that kind of money. It's hard to live off his pension. That's true, but... I'm sorry, if you are a Taurus - you will encounter many troubles today. - No way. It's 8 o'clock already. Are you going to make it by 9? You will be reunited with an unexpected person. - Turns out, you look good in a suit too. - What do you mean 'too?' You and Daddy. - Give me a break. - You two look cool. - Aren't you happy? - How can I be happy? Don't you remember he abandoned us? - Big brother, it's been so long-- - I'm off to work. - Morning. - Good morning. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Mom. Ayumu. Are you okay? - Can you stand up? - Are you all right? Are you all right? Are you okay? Oh, you are tough. Let's go. - Thank you very much. - Are you all right? Yes. Good. You are fine now. - Thank you so much. - It's nothing. Look, your friends are waiting for you. Good bye. I think I'm going to have a baby. What? Do it together, father. Grandma, are you all right? It's a snatcher. Don't worry. Please calm down. Please wait here. Wait, hold it. He's a snatcher! I said hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it right there. Damn you. Seriously? - Take this. - Please calm down. - So cool. - Ouch, ouch... - 9:02. We arrested the suspect. - Arrested? Thank you for your cooperation. I will take care of the rest. Stand up. - Excuse me. - Good bye. Hey, just be quiet. 9:02? Oh no. Community Safety Division, Juvenile Section, Officer Kajiwara Takeshi. Yes. Community Section Number 3, Corporal Kida Yoshihisa. Yes. Traffic Division, Traffic Enforcement Unit 1, Corporal Saeki Tomonori. Yes. Criminal Investigation Division, Investigation Unit 1, Corporal Sahara Natsuki. Corporal Sahara Natsuki. Yes? - Sahara Natsuki. - Yes. Yes. Sahara Natsuki and Maeda Hitomi were both arresting a snatcher. I apologize for being late. I'm sorry. [Taurus] - Traffic Division... - Nonsense. Are you serious? What? Father and son? I heard he has a family that lives separately since he got divorced over a decade ago. Yeah, as I recall he had a girlfriend and left his wife and children. If he hasn't seen them since then, this must be... An ironical reunion? - What is it? - Nothing. Well, whoever he is, I wouldn't be easy on him. Sahara, Maeda, come over here. [Criminal Investigation Division] - Yes. - Yes. There is something I want to tell you before issuing these to you. You both didn't have these this morning. - Which means... - Our rights were the same as ordinary citizens. To be precise, I should have said 'emergency arrest.' Why did you throw the suspect to the ground if you had known that? If the public makes a big deal out of... the attack on the suspect without carrying a police ID, we might lose our authority. - But... - But? No, no. There is no way that you can win against him in an argument. If you regret what you did, apologize first. Understand? I'm sorry. If you can get away with everything by saying sorry, there's no need for the police. Where you arrested the suspect was technically within the Hibiya Police precinct. You have no rights to violate someone else's territory. - But before my eyes, the suspect was... - There's no need to hear your excuse. The rules are everything in this profession. You aren't allowed to act on your conscience. But... Oh please, Inspector, he's talking back again. I think they need to learn at the police academy about the hierarchy again. You are right. They do need to be educated, Gentle. - Hmm? - Gentle? Teach him the ABC's of being a detective properly. Huh? Sahara Natsuki. Yes. Gentle will be your trainer. - What? - Excuse me? You two are partners starting today. - He's my partner? - He's my partner? Subtitles by DramaFever [Partners by Blood] - This is the worst ever. - This is the worst ever. May I ask where we are going, Shimao-senpai? Don't talk to me politely. Makes me feel sick. You are a lot more experienced, so I talk to you politely at least. - Geez. - And where to? We will interview people in Shintomi-cho. Interview who? The neighbors of a murder suspect. - What am I supposed to do? - Just watch quietly, kid. Kid? What is it? What is most important for a detective? - Passion? - Wrong. It's the jacket. Huh? If you will be my partner, make sure to follow three rules. Rules? First, wear a high quality jacket. If I was a perp, I would never make a confession to a detective - who is wearing a cheap jacket like yours. - It doesn't matter. - Second, talk to me in a polite form. - You said it would make you sick. Be quiet. I will take this opportunity to make this clear. Although we are family I'm your senior and you are my junior. You don't need to worry. I don't think we are family. The third one is the most important. - Listen carefully, the third... - Um... What is it? Shintomi-cho is this way. Senpai. What an impudent kid. Yes. The police. I'm sorry, he is a weirdo. You, don't interrupt. She is scared. Let me do it. - Did you come to interfere with my job? - Excuse me. How can I help you? I'm sorry about that. Huh? Huh? Ma'am, you are beautiful. Do you know this person? No. How about this person? No. I see. Thank you for your precious time. We are the police. Excuse us. Hey, hey... Did you finish the report on the snatcher? I just did. - Then let's ask the inspector to check it. - Yes. Although we are detectives we work so much at a desk too. Oh, the inspector isn't here. - Bachelor-san, do you have time? - I'm busy. Bachelor? I'll introduce him. His shooting skill is number one in the Ginza police station... He's known as Bachelor Koga. [Koga Hisashi] Excuse me, but why 'Bachelor?' Bachelor means single. Although he wants to get married more than anyone else. I see. Then I will ask that person. Don't ask Chaser. Chaser? That's right. People call him Chaser Inaki. [Inaki Toshifumi] He is a genius when it comes to tailing... and a cool headed guy who thinks everything through with reason. If you ask him to check it... he will scrutinize it and you never know how long it will take. He confessed everything. That's Skunk Togashi. [Togashi Kaoru] He is a military-man-type and the best interrogator in this division. Skunk? He has terribly smelly breath. Rumor has it that perps give up because of the smell of his breath. Let's go. All right? Hurry up. Come with me. And, I'm Takano. Pleased to meet you. [Takano Koji] Could it be that everyone calls each other by their nickname? Oh no, Taka gave them those names on his own. Inspector, could you please check the report? I will call you when I'm available. Please. And that's Inspector Kagiyama. He works overtime more than anyone else. He must be dedicated to his job. [Kagiyama Kensuke] I heard his family ignores him because he never comes home. That's sad. What? Do you want one too? No, thank you. I don't like the bitter taste. What about drinking parties? The Kagiyama Team basically only drinks beer. I can bear with it and drink. Daddy, wait for me. Daddy. Anyway, what was up with that interview? You put your face so close to her face. People's facial expressions are filled with clues. Especially at the edge of the pupil... It widens slightly when the person is afraid or upset. I didn't see any changes in her pupil when she saw both photos. That means she doesn't know anything about the suspect. But you didn't have to scare her. Why did you want to become a detective? Because I want to save people who are in trouble. Hmm. Do you think you can save people only by being gentle? It's necessary to take any possible measures to solve a case. - Even so, I don't want to hurt anyone. - You aren't cut out to be a detective. You aren't cut out for it. I don't want to see people get hurt because I grew up seeing my mom cry everyday. Hey, hey wait. Hey, you. If you want to tell me something just say it. Hey, wait. Hey. Yes. The suspect? I understand. We are on our way. The suspect was found dead. What? Hard work. - When was the last time you saw him? - Hey. - Don't puke after seeing the corpse. - I won't puke. Oh. It's damaged badly. If you are going to puke, go outside. Who's that? That's Gentle's... [Namekawa] Ah, he got assigned to the Criminal Investigation Division [Takeda] thanks to his father. So there's no mistake that this is Igawa Motohiko, right? Yes, there's no mistake. We found a suicide note written by him too. Detective Shimao. This is Igawa's daughter, Junko-san, the first person to find his body. - Yes. - Shoo, shoo... Hey, we are going to question her. How long do you think you are going to puke? Here is your coffee and iced cocoa. Lame. Um, did my father really commit murder? It's painful for me to tell you, but there's no mistake. I see. Could you tell us what kind of person your father was? Please excuse us. You don't need to ask her that. All we need is his name, address and birthday. That's not how it goes. We should take the time and listen to her. Our mission is to solve a case as fast as we can. - Your method is not effective. - Um... - I'm sorry about that. - I'm sorry about that. Now, please tell us about your father. - He was a clumsy person. - Clumsy... He had a craftsman's mind. He was a reserved man, so I didn't like him. Craftsman. Reserved. He carried all the burden by himself. He didn't tell me about his accumulated debt either. I'm responsible for this crime too. I know he could have been more vocal, so I should have tried to listen to him. Then my father wouldn't have... Only his family could have understood his weakness and suffering. I can't believe I'm regretting like this. [Clumsy, Craftsman, Reserved] It's strange. Huh? I'm... Because he is a suspected murderer... I thought I shouldn't cry or be sad. That's not true. I'm sorry, but may I go blow my nose? I heard you cried. What? You cried during the interview, didn't you? Lame. A man who cries easily is the worst. I've never heard of anyone crying at the interview. I was taught to be a person who can support other people emotionally. - Like Gentle? - How? He is totally opposite from that. - But you became a detective admiring Gentle... - He has nothing to do with it. Let's eat. Oh, you don't like wasabi either, Sahara. Either? Because Gentle... What was that? - It's decided... Sahara's nickname. - Yes? Since you became a detective, you want one too, don't you? No, I don't. I'm okay. Starting today, you are Junior. - Junior? - All right. To commemorate Junior's new name... Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Excuse me, I dropped a plate. Junior. Detective Junior. - Thank you very much for treating us. - Don't worry. It was a welcoming party for you. Because you drank most of it. I didn't drink that much. You touched one of our girls' tits, didn't you? It must be a rip-off. Those guys don't know the limit. It looks like it's a hundred-thousand-yen. - A hundred-thousand? - Must be adult entertainment. I can't pay such an amount. Just pay for it already. Hey, wait, wait, wait... The adult entertainment industry is under the Community Safety Division's jurisdiction. But... The case is being investigated undercover. They are letting them free for a month. Are you saying we will let more people fall victim for a month? They can catch them at once if they have a list of people who are blackmailed. The plan will be ruined if we butt in right now. It's hard but you have to bite your lip. Is this your daughter on your phone? She's pretty. Don't touch me. I will tell your workplace too. Please forgive me. Just pay the money. Please forgive me. I'll tell your daughter too. I just can't. I'm sorry. - Hey. - Hey. Are you all right? Hey, what the hell are you doing? - Leave. - What did you do that for? Run. What the hell did you do that for? Do you know what you did to us? Stop right there. Who the hell are you? That's our Junior. How nicely you treated our boy. Let us hear what you want to say. Hello? It's not good. It's the police. I'm not mistaken. Get out of my way. Welcome. Excuse me. Bring us a bottle of champagne. Excuse me. I'm sorry. - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. Stop. - Hot. - Do you need help? Old man. [Payers List] You played with some troublesome fire, huh? [Community Safety Division] Inspector Ebuchi. I am truly sorry. Impressive. Very impressive. That's what I expect from the Criminal Investigation Division. Thanks to you, we could finally seize the list of the blackmail victims... that we have been cautiously pursuing. Let's go. You must be the newbie? Don't you want to know what his parents are like, Shimao-san? Let's go. Please discipline your own son at least. Why did you do such a thing on your own? - I'm sorry. - I'm asking you the reason. - I couldn't just watch it. - I told you not to act on your conscience. Do you know how much trouble you've caused to everyone? Come. Write it by tomorrow. I will check it when you are done. [How to write a letter of resignation] I could tell even he was depressed. You are very harsh on him. Is it because he is your son? That has nothing to do with it. Then is it because he is your partner? Um... I'm the daughter of Maeda Shuichi. You knew it? You are a grown up now. My father always talked about you at home. I admired Detective Shimao whom my father talked about happily. Let me tell you straight, I'm not a hero. In fact I couldn't save your father. Is it true that the perpetrator hasn't been caught? Yes. I want to catch him no matter what it takes. I agree. Hey, go home if you aren't doing anything. Um, Inspector. I am sorry for causing you trouble today. Don't worry... since we are family. Family? The police need stronger ties between people than ordinary companies. Whether you make a mistake or not, everyone has to help each other. It's like a family, isn't it? Well, there might be things that are hard to say to your real family. Is it difficult to work with your dad? We have some problems. I think it's hard for Shimao-senpai to work with me too. He is a strange guy but you can learn a lot from him. Yes. And I have a feeling that at heart, he is happy that he is paired with his son. It can't be. It's hard to be honest to your own family. You will understand someday. Ah. Fool. What? You really are a fool. Fool? We got assigned at the same time to the same division. If you do something foolish, I will be looked at in the same way. Sorry. What if I lose my reputation too? Sorry. Well, it was exhilarating a little. What? Nevermind. Bye. Ow... Ouch, ouch... - Hard work. - Hard work. How is the rookie? You mean Maeda? I think she is brilliant like Shuichi. She doesn't seem like she would use her gender as a weapon. Your son is like you too. How? I'm stylish, he is... The way you two are clumsy is so similar. You are pushing him away coldly because you don't want to put your son in danger. Am I wrong? If I were Junior's parent, there's no doubt that I would be worried. He is too kind to look back at what risk he is taking. Junior is a son to all of us. Don't carry all the responsibility as a father by yourself. I'm getting dizzy. Inspector, why don't you go home early for once? It's none of your business. Could you please check this? [A letter of remorse] - I told you to write a letter of resignation. - Please let me continue. Please. If you want to be my partner, you have to follow the rules. [Ginza Eikoku-ya] [Ginza Eikoku-ya] Are you looking for something specific? Well... Expensive... Would you like to try it on? Ah, no, I'm okay. Seriously? [Balance 31,890 yen] Welcome. What should I do? Don't move. Go touch the wall. Hurry up. I said don't move. Don't move if you don't want to die. What is the situation? There are three of them. Carrying guns. Did they want something? They want a vehicle to get away. Steal the money and escape by using hostages as their shield. It's a typical tactic. Let's drag it out to a long battle and wait until they lose their focus. But actually... The suspects declared they will kill a hostage every 30 minutes. It's been 15 minutes already. Hey, Gentle, where is Junior? I'm not sure. Contact him. Me? Shut up. Take your cell phone out. Give me your damn cell phone. - Which one is that? - Whose is that? It's coming from the bathroom. Go check. Well? He didn't answer. Where could he be wondering around? Hey. Where is it? Is it here? The third one. Damn. A cell phone was on the floor. What is everyone's position? Koga, Togashi. Hello? - Where are you fooling around? - Shh. There is a barricaded robbery at the Midori Bank's Kyobashi Branch. Come as soon as possible. I'm here already. What? I'm in the bathroom of the Midori Bank's Kyobashi Branch. Are you serious? I'm hiding and surveying the situation. Well... Sahara Natsuki is in the bathroom of this bank. - What? - Bathroom? Is he peeing? What is he doing? Tell us the situation. There are three robbers. I can't see their faces since they are all wearing a mask. Two of them have a gun. There are about 20 hostages including the bank employees. I don't think anyone is injured. All right. Don't move an inch from there and report to us point by point. I understand. Precisely 30 minutes. Now I will kill the first person. What happened? Sahara. Hey. Don't worry. Don't do anything on your own, understand? If you want to die, lower your hand. Ah, you all want to die? Don't move there until you are instructed, understand? Um... I've got a plan. Carry the shield. Move forward. Be quick. That's reckless. But... No butts. Don't move at all from there. Hey, are you listening, Sahara? Should I choose from here? Or here? Or here? I'll teach you. What happened, Sahara? Report to us. Hey, I said to report to us. Do what you are told. Nothing good ever happened when I listened to you. What? I did what I was told but you never came back. Ever. Anyway, don't move. Do you want me to kill you? Please don't. Don't do anything on your own. Don't make me say it so many times. Please don't do it. Don't. I just... don't want to see anyone get hurt. Don't. Don't. Don't. Excuse me. Who is it? Where did you come from? I'm sorry. I was in the bathroom. That fool. Is this yours? Yes. What were you doing? Um, I had a stomach ache. Shut up. Die. Hey. Come over here. Yes. He is all right. There are approximately 50 onlookers. I've got a plan. I will be one of the hostages and draw their attention. Please charge in when I send you a cue when there is a chance. Gentle? When I give you the cue, we charge in. Sit down. Everyone, please calm down. We will be okay. Let's listen to him. He is kind and strong. Don't worry. A hero will come and save us. Really? Yeah, we will be saved for sure. So don't cry, okay? Okay. Good boy. What are you talking about? Gentle. We got connected to the security camera. All right. The video is from the security company. Sorry to keep you waiting. Kid. Stand up. Stand up. Excuse me. Huh? There is a security camera. Is that okay? That fool. Why did he do that? I'm annoyed by you meddling with us. Are you messing with us? I'm sorry. I'll kill you first. Um... Can I call my parents before I die? - Huh? - Can I borrow a phone? Now, please charge in. Charge in. Die. You shot six times already. Nonsense. You should know how many bullets you have. Damn you. Nonsense... don't copy me. The police. Freeze. Don't move. I captured him. Put your face down. Don't move. Hey. Inspector. Maeda. I won't let you escape. Get out of my way. I arrested him. You've got a kind face. Get up. Come. Good. Great job. Let's go. Dad. - Okay, caught him. - I caught him. Nice teamwork. That's what we'd expect from father and son. That's irrelevant. - Thank you very much. - It's nothing. Well, good bye. Please take care of yourself. Let's go. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. Hey, kid. You'd better be more accurate about the situation. He was hiding a gun. Thanks to you, I got wrinkles on my jacket. I'm sorry. - I told you I don't like the bitter taste. - I forgot to tell you. The third rule... Don't ever turn your back to the enemy. Well, you got more backbone than I expected. - Did you call me Dad earlier? - No, I didn't. You aren't lovable. - Didn't you say 'Dad?' - I really didn't say that. - You didn't? - I didn't. [Gentle Coffee] [No sugar. Black. Bitter taste.] Bitter. This belongs to you, doesn't it? Huh? To all police officers. The real case will happen soon. I have no idea. Stop acting. The real case will happen soon. To all police officers. Like father, like son, huh? I'm home. Welcome home, big brother. - Flip. - Wow. Why are you here? I don't want to come to a place like this. - Then don't come. - Oh please. I invited him. - Right, Daddy? - Yeah. So you two were in touch after all. Daddy said he would buy me something as a college entrance gift. - Don't get anything from him. - Why? It's not fair if it's only you. Huh? That's from Daddy. Don't do anything without asking me. - Don't try to act strong, poor man. - Don't look at it. Wow, you are so poor. You should just take it. Try it on. Daddy, don't you want to see? - It has bonito flakes. - It does. No way. - Huh? - Look at the lining. It's nice, isn't it? It's a grown-up man's pattern. You got a problem? It's nonsense. You should never say that. - Why this pattern? - It's a nice pattern. - No, it's not. - But it's cool. It's not cool. It's too flashy. Detectives don't wear a jacket like this. Wait a minute. You aren't talking to me politely. - Rule number two... - It doesn't matter when I'm off duty. - It does. It does. It does. - It doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't. I'll start eating. - Hello? - Hello? The suspect... Died in an explosion in the interrogation room? - I'll be right there. - I'll be right there. Subtitles by DramaFever It's a bomb. Follow the instructions quietly. Yumichi. Stop. The suspect took the ransom by a radio control helicopter. We will definitely find him. What should we talk about? Have a father-and-son conversation. A bomb is planted in the food court. Don't act on your own. You aren't cut out to be a detective. Work isn't the only duty a father has.
