Where? Where? And bow! Company, disperse! Big brother! Big brother! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Huh? Oh, it's you, Santa. Let your big brother hold you. Okay. Big Brother rides on a battleship. No, that's not so. Then, on a cruiser? Nope. Then, on a destroyer? A submarine? Nope. That's so boring. You don't ride on anything. Santa, navy soldiers don't just ride on fighting ships. Think it over a little harder. Well, I don't know... Ah! I got it! Bombers, bombers! You ride on fighter planes, that's really amazing! Boom, boom, boom! Whooo! Boom, boom, boom! Father, Mother, I'm home! Hmm? Wankichi. Ah, Wankichi! Wankichi, so glad to see you home! Big brother Harukichi, tell us about the war! Yes! Yes! Okay, I shall, so let go, let go. I wanna fly a plane! Vooom, voom, boom! Voom! Then I'll start my story. The best experience I had after joining our nation's forces was flying in an aeroplane for the first time. I was copilot for a short mission. It was me inside the vast blue sky, looking over everything. I looked down on the villagers here and saw everyone's faces smiling up at me. We crossed over village after village at an astounding speed. Vrooom, vroom, vroom... Faster than a train? Stupid, Stupid! Don't you know? Much faster, of course. Yes. And inside the plane, I was riding backwards, you know. I'd like to take you all flying sometime. It's lots of fun. You mean I can fly too? After I learned how to fly... I was ready to start training for combat. I went into the field with a rifle and ba-ba-ba-bam, whooosh, boom, boom! Crash. Flip. Spin! Hey! Emergency, emergency! Little Santa has fallen into the river! Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho... Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho... Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho... Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho... Heave-ho, heave-ho, heave-ho... Thirty minutes until we strike. All units ready! Prepare to fire... Ready! "Eastern Allied Sea Forces, Headquarters" Chop the trees, oh chop the trees, work so very hard. Yes! Work hard with a smile, snappy, snappy. Yes! Burning in our little hearts is the power of Japan. The power of Japan, the power of Japan. Never stopping from morning to night. Yes! If we work together, the job isn't so tough. Yes! Up in the sky, there's Mr. Sun. He's shining down, shining down on us. Pull, pull, pull the lines. Pull them all day long. Just show us any obstacle, we're not afraid. Tug, tug, tug again. Tug it all the way down. Oh, the joys of working. Let's all have fun helping each other. Oh, yes, all of us are so fortunate. Dragging, dragging, strained. Panting, panting, strained. The path we walk on is long and harsh... Drag, drag, drag and a drag, drag, drag... And a cheer as you drag. Drag, drag, drag, and a drag. With a strength that dances... And a divinity that guides us... Our true hearts shall carry us forward. The glorious fortress of our country is now complete. If we persevere and work together... We shall be victorious. Our victorious end begins right here, right now. Victory for the wonderful kingdom of the East. Something's come. Something, something. Something new has come here. How strange and curious it is. It just appeared out of nowhere... And came here to us. Oh look, oh look! A brave an wonderful man has come out! (Yes he has!) Let's have sushi for dinner tonight. Yes, let's have sushi. Underneath the three, tall trees... They have honoured us with their visit. Little, humble us. Just a little, just a little, they look like us. Just a little, though. Company, forward, march! Our kingdom is beautiful and proud. We shall not falter in the danger. With songs in our mouths and dreams in our hearts... Our sakura flowers shall soar high and proud. Gracefully and beautifully... And powerfully. The winds will whirl up the mountains... And bring us good fortune. What could it be now? What could it be now? I think it's a certain kind of banana. At least that's what I think. No, no, it's a bunch of sheets. Rolled up nicely. I think it's a tasty cigar. Well now, we have no idea what it is. An army cannot march on an empty stomach. The army will be gloomy if hungry. Would you like some bananas? And how about a melon? Dive right in! How about some bananas? How about some melons? Dive right in, dive right in. Eat your fill. Everyone, everyone, enjoy the wonderful flavours. Your bellies shall be full and happy... With the delicious and beautiful flavours. Everyone, everyone, eat your fill. Eat until you're full. Atama... Atama! Ashi... Ashi! Asahi... Asahi! Asahi... Asahi! Now, let's start from the beginning, all together. Yes! Yes! Yes! You! You! You! Yes! Go! Go! Go! Yes! Go!

I miss you big brother, and can't wait for you to come home." --Santa, c/o the Navy Hey! Hurry! Captain! There's danger! The enemy has approached nearer and ceased all movement. Please give us your new orders! All right! This enemy is a dangerous one. Be careful as you investigate. Hey! Incoming plane! Hey! Incoming plane! Boy, it's hot. Oh, hot. Hot... Hello? Yes? Hello,hello? Hello? Hello? No reports from the front. All right. Hot... Captain! Sir! Reporting back from the investigation! A new force has been spotted! Planes are departing from Hiroshima! This is more effective than an infantry invasion. That is all. Good. Thank you. Company. . .ready. . . About face! "Film developing room" Hello? Yes? Hello? Hello? Yes? Yes? Yes? Hello? Yes? Company... ready. . . About face...and go! You! At last, the long-awaited campaign we have devised...shall commence now. I think you all have prepared mentally for this day. It's time to stay together as one and complete the task. Don't forget your training and let's show them what our country is made of! You boys have been training this whole time. Away from your parents...and your siblings... Unable to tell them of your training. I understand this must have been difficult for you. But tomorrow, the final page shall be turned on our fight against the enemy. Are you boys all ready? Yes, sir! Good. Then tonight shall be our last night here. Tomorrow morning we attack. That is all! Good! Good! Good! Good! "Chocolate" The blue, endless southern sea. Small islands in this part of the world were scattered in the sea like the stars in the sky. And one of those islands in the middle, was the most beautiful island in the world. Long ago, a good king, Goa, used to rule this island. And all of his subjects lived days of happiness and good fortune under his gentle rule. Until one day, arriving at the island's harbour, a black ship showed itself to the islanders. Before long, the islanders began to panic. I fear, they fled to their beloved king and revealed the grave news. The visitor from the black ship was a white man. To the trusting King Goa, the white man said: We are merchants from a far off land who seek peaceful trade." We wish to develop a long-standing brotherhood with your wonderful island." Incidentally, returning to our ship every night is a bit difficult for us." We really would appreciate it if you would surrender a small piece of your land for our use." "What do you say?" Our ship is filled from top to bottom with treasures from all over the world." "First, spices from Persia." "Tobacco from Egypt." "Jewels from India." "Necklaces from Siam." Printed cotton and oriental lamps, and tea from Canton." "Silver and gold." "And fine gold dust." The islanders answered, we would love to bring these treasures down..." "But you must give us some time." The white man said: Preposterous! You need only see this one jewel to see our worth." "I thank you for your consideration." "Merciful and kind King Goa." Suspicious of the ambassador's kind-hearted words, the king asked the white man if his promise was different than implied. "Oh dear, how embarrassing." I don't suppose you are familiar with the commercial code of our land." "This is my country's home base now." King Goa's people fought hard. But they were defeated in the end. But they were defeated in the end. And their beautiful island fell into the hands of pirates. Enriched with unspoiled jungles and ancient monuments... on bright moonlit nights... this island was once known as the "kingdom of angels," on loan from the gods. The natives of this island will never again be free. Spread your legs and run fast. Spread your wings and fly fast. Boom boom, run along. Doh, doh, run along. Everyone, everyone, run along. Yes, yes, run along. Yes, yes, run fast. Everyone, run along. Spread your wings wide and fly along. Your body and your legs must never falter. Boom boom, run along. Doh, doh, run along. Everyone, run along. Yes, yes, run along. Yes, yes, run fast. Everyone, run along. Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead! We have been far away from home for long years. Crossing over the seas to face the enemy. To the north, to the north in our iron flock. I beg of you, strong wings, carry me through. Fluttering...and fluttering... We are like mighty fighting birds. One day, we shall return home and tell stories of our victory. "30 minutes remaining until the drop point. I pray for everyone's success. --The Captain" Twenty minutes until arrival! All men at your stations! Let's go! Let's do it! Fire, fire, fire! Hey, fire! Okay, sir. Say,you. Save me! We've got to find some cover! Charge! Well...er, uh...I was saying...it's because I have no command over all troops. So I think it impossible to agree to a complete unconditional surrender. In that case, what are your terms? Under the authority of the governor, I have a degree of authority over some of the troops. Where did your governor go? He left by plane a few days ago. Then we shall take full control of you for the period until he returns. But-but-but that puts me in a difficult position. I can only assume responsibility of the army airfield at Devil's Island... And the surrounding military facilities... As well as the fortified zone along the south beach. Also the army barracks at Devil's Lake south of the airfield. Yes, sir...yes, sir... Tell your men to secure these areas for us. Er, uh... I don't think, sir, that my command would cover that far. After all, I'm not the commander of all troops, sir. Now if the governor were here, it would help matters a great deal. In that case, you have no choice but to surrender full control over to us until he returns. I shall not accept any alternatives! We can bluff... Of course we must not surrender... Certainly, sir. The war is already on our side, we'll just hold them off a little more, that's all. Absolutely, yes, yes, right away. W-W-Well, in th-that c-c-case, sir... We'll return and give our a-a-answer b-b-by t-t-ten o'clock. Ten o'clock, my foot! Everything falls now. Tell all your units to pull back at once! We agree, sir! We agree, sir! Yes, sir! Please sir, if you'll only stop your general attack! So, do you agree to an unconditional surrender? Or do you still insist on stalling? Which is it?! Yes, sir...yes! We agree to unconditional surrender. Ye-Yes! Certainly! Unconditional surrender! Yes! Yes! Yes, certainly. Certainly, sir. Hey! Hurry, this way!
