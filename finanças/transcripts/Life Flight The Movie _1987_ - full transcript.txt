(orchestral music) (helicopter whirring) (snowmobile revving) (uplifitng acoustic guitar music) (gasping) - What's happening? - Not much. How are you and Michael coming with the kit car? - Pretty good actually. What's this about? - You really wanna know? - Just making conversation. You know, I can't believe CJ gave that up. It's amazing. - When did you become interested in collecting things like that? - I started collecting bottle caps when I was a kid, marbles, that sort of thing. I just never outgrew it. Seriously though, if you run into another one of those, give me a call, will you? - [Voiceover] Attention Life Flight personnel, you have a scene flight in Urbandale. - [Voiceover] We've tried everything we can think of to get them out. The ice is too thin. - Yes, we are available, I'll get my crew started immediately. - What can we do to assist a rescue of this kind? - The best we can with what we've got, grab the life jackets from the shed. (dramatic orchestral music) (helicopter whirring) - [Rob] It's gonna work, Gary? - [Gary] No, let's get that ladder in here! Urbandale rescue, Life Flight ETA is three minutes. Can you tell me what the situation is? - [Voiceover] We made attempts with a boat and with the sled, but the ice is too thin, we can't get to them. - Where's your volunteer? - There's no one available. - Just pick one up at the site. - Please, God, let me get a full time crew. - You okay? - Oh yeah, I'm fine. (dramatic music) - Urbandale Rescue, we're gonna need an EMT assist, a rope, some men to help remove a door. - Affirmative. - Have you identified a landing site yet? - We have an ambulance to the North, we also have a fire truck to the South, we have a gravel road on your East side, we have train lining from the North around to the East and onto the South. We'll be on the East side of (mumble) reservoir. - [Voiceover] Kelly, we have a multiple car accident coming in and we need more help in ER, do you have anyone that could assist? - No, but I'll be glad to help until I got a call. - They're been telling me they'd like increased hemodynamic monitoring capabilities. Of course I can support that. We need it now. That's because the current bedside monitoring system is antiquated. (helicopter whirring) (dramatic sting) Okay, bye bye. - Well, ready to call it a day? - What are you doing here? - I just happened to be in the neighborhood. - Well what a nice surprise. - Yeah, I've got a better one at home. - My running shoes. You finally picked up my running shoes! - How did you know that? - 'Cause that's the only thing that would surprise me. - Wanna go try 'em out? - Come on, old man, try and keep up. - It's those new shoes. - Nah, it's because you're old! - Old, huh? I'll race you to the bridge! - You'll never make it to the bridge. - I won't? Ever since I've been to the doctor, I won't have trouble keeping up with you. - What are you talking about? - Oh, didn't I tell you? I went to see Doc Richards and I told him I was having trouble keeping up. He said no problem, here's what you do, you run 10 miles a day for eight days alone and then you won't have any problems. Then call him and tell him what happened. - Really? - Yeah, so eight days later I called him and he said well did you run your 10 miles a day for eight days like I told you, I said yeah. He said well how'd you do. I said how would I know, I'm 80 miles from home! (laughing) - Oh, you smarty pants! You're on the bridge! - Okay. (jovial piano music) (laughing) - Glad to see you could finally make it. - I hate it when you do that. It's those shoes. - Nah. - Yeah. - It's just 'cause you're old. (giggling) - I'm gonna get you next time. Come on, tell me the truth. - What? - You took the shortcut. - I did not! - Eric, you're going nowhere! You're such a loser, Eric, you know? Ever since you started hanging around with Brian. Every time you're with him, you're wasted. And I'm sick of it! Just don't call me anymore, okay?! Just don't call me anymore! - [Martin] ER, Nurse Martin speaking. - Hi, this is Kelly down at Life Flight. Do you have anyone who could cover for us between seven and midnight? - [Martin] Bob and Michael are available. - If you could send Michael down, we could give him a page and orient him. (suspenseful synthesizer music) - Think there'll be anything in here that I could use to help Rob? - I don't think Rob is interested in finding God's will in his life, do you? - Yeah, you're probably right. - One thing he might relate to though is the kit car you're building. Does Rob has a blueprint or plan? - Yeah, but he never uses it. He thinks he knows more than the people who designed it. - But a car just doesn't happen. And if he doesn't follow the blueprint, the chances are the car will be built wrong or at least it won't be designed as good as it could be. If you could just make him realize that life doesn't come together very well either without God's blueprint. (suspenseful music) (loud crash) - [Voiceover] Attention Life Flight personnel, you have a scene flight in (mumble) on Gulf View Road a quarter mile North of Highway 101. (helicopter whirring) - [Michael] When we get there, what will you want me to do? - [Kelly] You can hook the patient to the monitor, start IV, take a pressure. - [Voiceover] Got pulse 120. - Respiration's at 30 seconds (mumble). - [Rob] Hope County 203, this is Life Flight. Our ETA to your destination is nine minutes. - I'm gonna start an IV here, guys. - Go ahead. - Hope County 203, can you tell us about your patient? - We have one victim, male, approximately 16 years of age, he has a BP of 90 over 40. Glasgow of seven, his heart rate is 120, respiration 36 in labor. He has head to chest injuries. - Dispatch, this is Life Fight, we have one male patient with a Glasgow of seven, head and chest injuries. We'll be landing in one minute. - Life Flight, this is dispatch, I show you landing at 22:30 hours. - What do we got? - Here, put this on your leg and you write vitals down on him. - [Rob] Kelly, where's the IV equipment? - [Kelly] Over here in the back of the pilot's seat. - [Rob] How about the blood pressure cuffs? - [Kelly] Oh, the cuffs are in the trauma bag. (glass breaking) - John, I heard something. John. Someone's in the house. (suspenseful music) - Be careful. (cat meowing) - Daddy, I have to go to the bathroom. - You know where the bathroom is, honey. (cat meowing) - [Voiceover] Is everything okay? - Yeah, it was just the cat. (dramatic music) - Boy, I don't know, Kelly. - You were great. - I wish I could do it all the time, but I just felt like I was in the way. - I couldn't have done it without you. - You shouldn't have to worry about the patient and training me at the same time. - I'm trying to get that corrected. Oh, Michael, I've been meaning to ask you something. I'm moving into a new apartment and I really need someone to take care of my fish, could you do that for me? - I guess so, but I don't know anything about fish. - [Kelly] I know that you want what's best for the patient, Mr. Overton, but look, how can you offer the best for the patient when my flight nurses are busy monitoring the skill levels of volunteers? - The volunteer program is working very well for us, Kelly. - I agree, but that's not the issue here. - Then what is the issue here? The original program called for a helicopter with a pilot and one nurse on board. - But the program was new all over the country, it hadn't even been tested! Now we found we need two full time people with advanced life support skills. - If you can convince Linda that this program deserves priority over other programs -- - I have tried on several occasions. - Kelly, I really think you're gonna have to take this up with Linda Reynolds. - You have all the people that you need. You seem to forget that they put this program on the map. Those volunteers come from every recuse discipline in the area. - Linda, we're putting primary medical care in the hands of volunteers too many times. All I'm asking for is just to have someone whose skills we're all familiar with. - Kelly, are you trying to say that our volunteers are not competent? - I don't think that at all, Linda. - Kelly, this is really beginning to grate on me. You seem to think that I don't want what's best for the patient. The Life Flight program, as you very well know, is not a profitable venture. Look Kelly, there are other programs here that need money. Now I just can't see pouring money into a program that is working fine. We provide the service because there's a need. - Hi, Eric, remember me? My name is Michael, I'm one of the people who came out to pick you up. Those of us who were on your flight will be dropping by from time to time just to see how you're doing. - Okay, how do you wanna set the timing? - It should be set at four degrees before top dead center according to the book. - I don't know what the book says, four degrees is too low. You sure it says four? - Mmhm, according to this the combustion runs hotter and you get less emissions. - We get less power too. - Look Rob, all I'm saying is according to the book, the timing should be set at four degrees. Did you hear Kelly's getting a new apartment? - Really? - Yeah, she wants me to take care of her fish for a weekend, I don't know anything about fish. - Tell her I'll take care of them for her. - You will? - Sure. You know what I really think we oughta set this at? - What? - About 12 to 14 degrees. - Come on, you can't set it that high. - Why not? - Well five or six degrees maybe, but 14? The book says four, Rob. - Guess I should know better than to argue with you about a book, huh? - What do you mean? - Well you practically live by what it says in your bible. - All I'm saying is that the guy who designed this gave us a book of instructions, it's a little silly for us to try and do it our own way. - I always do things my own way. - Fine, do it your own way, all I'm saying is things might not run as smoothly as they were designed to. - Are you talking about the instruction book or the bible? - I'm talking about the car. - No you're not, you're talking about the bible. And you're trying to convince me that the bible is the answer to every conceivable problem I could come up against in life. I'm telling you that while that's a very attractive fantasy, life just doesn't work that way. - All right, if you wanna talk about the bible I can tell you that all the principles you need to guide you through your problems are in the bible, and if you run into a problem, you can call the designer 'cause He knows what you're trying to do. - If He already knows what I'm trying to do, then why do I have to ask? - I love what I do, it's just not enough of a challenge. - Why don't you go out and find something more? Oh hun, that goes over here. - The question is where do I go. The only people doing what I wanna do is Life Flight. - I think it'd be great if you could join them, but the way things are now, it could take awhile. - I guess I'm not in a big hurry. I've got some things that I gotta work out. - You mean what happened in Vietnam? - Yeah. - You know, other than the fact that your helicopter was shot down, you've never really said much about what went on over there. - Well I've been wanting to talk about that. Just wanted to forget it. - Well you have to face that and deal with it if you're gonna get serious about Life Flight. - The question is how. - We'll do it together. We'll ask God to show us how to deal with it. If Life Flight is part of God's plan for you life, then I figure He'll help us sort it out. (military drum music) (crickets chirping) (helicopter whirring) - [Fire Bird] War Wagon, Fire Bird's in orbit. (loud explosions) (gunfire) - [Voiceover] Go for it! Go for it! (gunfire) (helicopter beeping) - [Linda] What happened? - I kept waiting for the impact, but it never came, at least I don't remember it. I was holding this in my hand so tight it actually cut my palm. Then I looked outside and we were sitting in this rice patty. - How'd you get back to base? - Well another helicopter came in a matter fo minutes to pick up the wounded. We were near the base by that time. I kept hearing the pilot joking. - Joking? - Yeah, he said there were only two things you couldn't afford to lose in combat. Sense of humor and your main rotor. - I guess he was trained for that sort of thing, huh? - Yeah. And I wasn't, that's why he can get back in a helicopter and I can't. - I see why you're not too thrilled about getting back in a chopper. - But I am. That's what I don't understand. I mean, I'm not happy doing what I'm doing. Here I am being pulled toward a job in a helicopter for a company that isn't even hiring. Figure that one out. - [Kelly] After the tank's filled you just check the PH balance of the water with this. - That's before I add this and after I add this? - Wrong. - This way. - Right. - Okay. - All you have to do is just read the instructions on the side, you're gonna be fine, Rob. But you do have to check the water temperature if you add any water. I guess that's just about the extent of it. - I'll do my best. (dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Shannon, mommy's still waiting for the (mumble)! - How are you and Kelly's fish getting along? - They're fine. What's the big deal, they're fish. You feed them, they're fine. - I wouldn't want the responsibility, those fish mean an awful lot to her. I gotta run down to the car for a minute, I'll be right back. - Okay. - [Voiceover] Are you born again? It is not enough to say I belong to a church or I suppose I'm a Christian. My friends, thousands say they are born again. A man who is truly born again believes that Jesus Christ is the only savior who can pardon his soul. We have this phrase many places in the bible, I'm reminded of the meeting between Nicodemus and Jesus Christ. - How come you did that? - I don't wanna listen to that. - Why not? - Because either they're telling you that I go to Hell, or they want all my money. - That's not true. - Sure it is. They're always putting you on a guilt trip. And you know what really bothers me? If I don't believe the way they do, then I'm the one who's wrong. What makes them so sure they're right? - But being born again, that's in the bible. - I've never seen it. - You ever read it? - Of course I've read the bible. I just don't remember anything about born again. - It's in there. - Where? - The New Testament. - Where in the New Testament? - Matthew, no... John -- - Michael, when was the last time you read the bible? - [Michael] Kelly! - Hi, Michael, how you doing? - How's it going with the Life Flight staff thing, you making any headway? - Oh Michael, it is so frustrating, I have tried everything, I have typed proposals, I have retyped and I am getting nowhere. - I heard you went to Mr. Overton. - I think I made things worse. - He's usually pretty sympathetic. - Well I'm gonna keep pushing. Oh Michael, you look terrible, I mean you haven't start your shift yet, what have you been doing? - Rob and I are still working on the kit car. I've been trying to share Christ with him, but it seems like the more I try, the more I mess up. - What do you mean? - He asks some very tough questions and I don't think he really wants to know the answers. - You know what I think? I think you're trying too hard. You can't agitate someone into a relationship with Christ. - I guess I've been doing that. - Are you relying on the Holy Spirit, or are you trying to do it yourself? - That's a good point. - You know what my problem used to be, I thought I had all the answers about Christianity, but I didn't. People would ask me questions, I'd give my opinion or some kind of pad answer instead of biblical truth, and the one thing we have to learn, Michael, is to discipline ourselves in God's word and the wise behind the faith before we can tell anyone. Oh come on, cheer up, Michael. I know you did better than you think. - But those are real tough questions. - At least he's asking the questions. - That's true. I gotta go. - Hang in! - Hey, where does it talk about born again in The New Testament? - In John. - Where in John? You're looking better every time I come in here, buddy. I understand the nurse came in yesterday, flipped on the Cubs game for you. Should have won. Should have won. I was over at Rob's working on the kit car, boy were we disappointed. You know anything about starters? We're having trouble with one. I'm gonna tell you the truth, starters aren't the only thing we're having trouble with. See, Rob has a lot of needs in his life, Eric. That he doesn't even know about. Needs only Christ can meet. Some of his flights are in marginal weather, what if his helicopter goes down? Where will he spend eternity? Rob doesn't know Christ. How can I get him interested in finding the answers to questions he's not even asking? Did you ever have a friend you really loved? I do. I want all my friends to meet Him. Christ has made such a difference in my life, I really want Rob to know Him. Hi. - Hi, Michael. - Are we working on the car tomorrow night? - Sure, what time do you wanna start? Oh, I can't, how about Wedesday? - Wednesday's fine, just let me know. - I watched Sergeant York on TV last night. Gary Cooper. Did you ever see it? - Yup. - You remember the scene where the army sent Sergeant York home to work out his problems about fighting? Why did he have to pray? - 'Cause he wanted to know God's will in regards to his killing enemy soldiers. - Yeah, but if Sergeant York already was a religious man, God knew what his problem was. So why did he have to pray? - When you were a kid, did you ever have an Erector Set? - Yeah. - Did you ever have any problem putting the pieces together? - No, actually, I was pretty good at the mechanical stuff. - Come on, there must have been some time when you have some problems. - What are you getting at? - When you had a problem, what'd you do? - I asked my dad. - That's my point, did he help? - Yeah, why wouldn't he? - Yeah, why wouldn't He? - But if God already knew what Sergeant York's problem was, why did he have to spend so much time going up to the mountains to ask for help? I mean if my dad knew that I had a problem, he'd come and help. - I'll bet your dad didn't do that. - What makes you say that? - Because if your dad helped you with everything, you never would have learned to do anything on your own. And you're too good with gadgets and stuff to make me believe that your dad helped you with everything. - What does it say in the bible about prayer? - What was wrong with my answer? - Actually, it kinda made sense. But that's just your opinion. I mean that is your opinion. Isn't there anything in the bible about prayer? - Sure. - Where? (military trumpet music) (car revs) - Oh, what is this? (glass shatters) (phone ringing) Hello? Well I think I wanna call it off. There's just too much going on. Okay, take it easy now. - Hi, honey. CJ, what's going on? - Not now, Linda, I'm not in the mood! - Well that gives us something in common. Are you gonna clean up that mess? Okay old man, you want war, you got war! The loser cleans up the mess! (laughs) Oh! (shrieks) Don't you dare use my decorative pillows! - All is fair in love and war, and you are in trouble! (jazzy music) - Gotcha! - Ah! - Ah! Evening, Mrs. Nelson! Linda and me, we're just having a little pillow talk. - Looks to me, young man, like Linda's doing most of the talking. - Oh she's got the artillery, and I've got the strategy! (laughing) Boy Linda, you're really out for blood. - Well you win a few, you lose a few, huh CJ? - Why is it every time I compete with you I lose? - (laughs) Now I want you to remember that even though you're not the boss at work, you're still second in command at home. (laughing) - So now he wants to know why Sergeant York prayed if God already knew the problem. I gave him a good answer, Eric. I gave him a very good answer. He still wouldn't accept it. I'll find him answers. It won't just be opinions either. (dramatic music) - [Rob] No, you can't do this to me, don't die! (sighs) What did mom used to do? Warm water and salt, that's right, okay. Come on, it worked for mom. Don't let me down, guys. (phone ringing) Hello? Kelly, hi! A few days earlier, good, glad to hear that. Yeah, they're fine. Listen, I have something on the stove. Okay, good, okay, bye. (wacky trumpet music) (dramatic music) - Mommy, come see what I found! - [Voiceover] Just a minute, honey! What'd you find, hun? - Will you help me find my dolly's head? - Oh, remember we lost the dolly's head at the lake. She doesn't have a head anymore. Just find something else to play with, okay? (helicopter whirring) (helicopter beeping) - One of the most life changing things that can ever happen to you or me is that we come to a place of personal faith in Jesus Christ as our savior. Jesus is our savior, we are the children of God, Heaven is our home and we have an eternal reason and purpose for this life right here on Earth. (dramatic music) (heart beating) - Mommy, I want a drink of water! - [Voiceover] I'll get it in just a minute, honey! (gunshot) (siren ringing) - [Milo] Resident is filing a 239, requesting Life Flight for a gunshot wound to the left chest, is it available? - I'll check with the pilot, Milo, weather conditions are marginal. (dramatic music) - We can't go across county because of the fog. (mumble) only 600 feet with one mile visibility. (siren ringing) - [Milo] Hope County, this is Milo, Unit 239, we're having mechanical problems in need a mutual assist from Indianola. Our location is... (siren ringing) - [Indianola] This is Indianola 248. Be advised, we're two miles South of town. ETA is two minutes. Have you called for Life Flight? - Yes, but the weather's too bad to fly. - [Weatherman] patchy fog in these areas could dissipate if the wind pattern continues to change. - [Milo] Dispatch, this is Milo. The Indianola Unit has just arrived, but the patient is in distress, she has a rapid heart rate, shallow respiration and may be developing a collapsed lung, request that you dispatch a Life Flight unit, we need a paramedic assist immediately. (siren ringing) (dramatic music) - [Weatherman] The fog is dissipating rapidly now in metropolitan areas. - [Dispatcher] Indianola, this is Life Flight dispatch. The (mumble) has lifted and it looks like we can now rendezvous at South Ridge Mall. Life Flight will meet your unit, ETA five minutes. Also, be advised that Life Flight is still in route with the paramedics to cover until the aircraft arrives. (sirens ringing) - CJ, I have a potentially dangerous situation here, I need a paramedic, would you fly with me? (dramatic orchestral music) - How is she? - You did it. - I didn't have much choice. - Were you afraid? - I was too busy to think about it. - It's strange, isn't it? How God works? I mean I know that woman wasn't injured tonight for your benefit, but of all the men who could have responded to that call, you were the one that was forced to come back in the helicopter. Aren't you excited, you did it! - I think I'll get nervous first. - Is that woman gonna make it? - Yeah, I think so. - Good. - She wouldn't have had much of a chance if it weren't for Life Flight. - Yeah. - Linda, I wanna be part of that program. That woman would have died if it weren't for that helicopter. - Hey, you don't have to sell me on it. Honey, I know this has been really tough on you, but I just want you to know that I am so proud of you. - I forgot to feed the fish. Nice going, Rob. Kelly trusts you with her fish, two boil to death, two starve to death. Man. - Now Kelly, I have been having this strong feeling that God has a future for me in Life Flight, and I know that you and Linda are working out this full time staff situation. - Do you ever wonder though if God really is concerned about our problems? - Hi, guys. - Hi, Rob. - Hi, Rob. - Here. - Oh, thank you. - How goes the battle for more staff? - Well we were just talking about that. In fact I was just about to share something with Kelly that might encourage both of you. She asked me if I ever wondered if God was interested in our problems. I was about to show her this. - It's a Maltese cross! - [Kelly] Beautiful. - [Rob] Do you know the history of this thing? - Only as far back as 1969. - This piece goes back to the 11th century. They were used as badges for the Hospitallers. They took care of the wounded knights. They were the first medics. - I didn't know that. - I've been looking for one of these for years. CJ, would you sell this? - Look, I know you're interested in this as a relic. But let me share something with you that's really important to me. (military drum music) I was with the 87th medical group in Vietnam. We were stationed in Da Nang. Up until that day, I never did believe that there really was a God. (loud explosion) (heicopter whirring) - [War Wagon] Fire Bird 2-2, this is War Wagon 6-0-5, we're going in on low levels from the Northwest. Appreciate you guys staying on our tail. - [Fire Bird] Roger, War Wagon. We'll be orbiting East West at 2,000 feet. If you take fire, say distance and direction. - Let's just stay here 'till things cool off a bit. Okay, Dan. - [War Wagon] We're coming out of the Northwest into a hot LZ. - [Fire Bird] Roger, War Wagon. We got your covered. - (mumble). - CJ! My badge. - Your badge? - My cross. Will you get my cross? - Danny, you gotta be kidding, I'm not going out there to get some good luck charm! - CJ, it's more than that, please. - Dan, that doesn't matter! What matters is I get you out of here in one piece. - CJ, please! - I gotta be nuts. - If I don't make it... I want you to have it. - Don't worry, Danny, you're gonna make it. - I want you to have it. - Danny, you're gonna make it! (dramatic music) (gunfire) - [CJ] You see, Danny Kellogg was killed. And I struggled with that for months. Then one day this Chaplain said something to me that made me realize that God's ways are not our ways. He said CJ, if you had died instead of Danny, and you went before God and God said to you CJ, why should I let you into my Heaven, what would you say? I didn't have an answer. But I knew that Danny Kellogg did. 'Cause he was a personal friend of God's son Jesus Christ. So I've kept this not as a good luck charm, but as a reminder of who God really is. Whenever I get discouraged or lack the faith to go for it, I use this to remind me to go to God's word and claim His promise. Then one day I just dropped it in a shoebox. - That's one heck of a story. - Now Kelly, I know how you're struggling with God's will for Life Flight. I want you to have this. - I can't take that. - No, you take it. On one condition, that if you ever get to the place where you think you're gonna drop it in the shoebox, that you pass it on to someone else who might benefit from it. - [Kelly] Thank you, CJ. - Well, more coffee? - No, I'm coffeed out. - You know, I was just wondering. What if I could get Linda just to consider maybe using some of our people on a full time basis? - You mean like Michael? - [Kelly] Yeah, like Michael. - Never hurts to ask. - Well then what'll I do? - Well... I'd go for it. - I've just read through your new proposal. I think it was very well stated. I was impressed, you covered a lot of good points, but you've gotta realize -- - Linda, are you really giving my request serious consideration? - What kind of question is that? - Linda, we're not talking about a piece of equipment or new uniforms, we're talking about quality care, we're talking about everything that Life Flight stands for, we're talking about lives! - You know, I am beginning to get very uncomfortable with what it is I think you're saying, you act as though I'm opposed to all these things! - I just think there's something else behind the decision besides budget priorities. - Oh, and what would that be? - I don't know! I just know that for someone who initiated this program that you don't understand what I'm trying to do here! - Kelly, you are way off base on this! I don't like the way you're handling this at all, now you don't understand where I'm coming from on this! - [Voiceover] Attention Life Flight personnel, you have a scene flight three miles north of Adele on Highway 33, 10-51 Central. (dramatic synthesizer music) - Kelly, is there anything I can do? - Yeah, pray. Call dispatch, tell them I'm gonna start CPR. - Dispatch, this is Life Flight, Kelly's too busy to talk to you right now, we've got a head injury on the way to Methodist, we've initiated CPR. - One and two and three and four! Come on, Shawn! Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 and 15, come on, Shawn, breathe! Come on, breathe, baby, breathe, you're almost there! (dramatic synthesizer music) (military drum music) - Go for it! - What did you do after you lost pressure and heart rate? - I... Inflated the (mumble), I pumped up the IV and I initiated CPR. - Did you give him epi or (mumble)? - I couldn't, I was alone. - Well you did what you could. - Yeah. - [Voiceover] I want you to think for a moment about what you're trying to accomplish in your life right now. Remember last week we talked about Matthew where Jesus says to him who knocks, the door will be open? Well that's a promise. But if we kick the doors down in trying to create our own opportunities, then we're not allowing God to pave the way. God promises that He'll give us the desires of our heart if we commit our ways to Him. Have you committed it to God? And have you left it there. I want you all to just think for a minute about what you're trying to accomplish right now in your life. (soft acoutic guitar music) Have you committed to God? And have you left it there? - [Rob] Penny for your thoughts? - I'm sorry, I guess I was daydreaming. - Well if you're gonna dream, my daddy always said to dream big 'cause it doesn't cost any more. - I don't know, I guess I was remembering my favorite verse I learned as a little girl in camp. - I'd like to hear it. - Would you really? - Sure. - It's written in Proverbs. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding, and always acknowledge Him and you'll make your path straight. That's a beautiful promise, Rob. I don't know, I just believe that somehow God's gonna work it out where we get a full time staff. - Well that'll take an act of God for sure. Who knows, maybe we'll luck out. - I'm ready for him, Eric. I'm doing what I can do, and if the Holy Spirit leads, maybe we can convince Rob that the one who designed the instruction book really does know what He's talking about. I know how he feels. People used to try and share with me, I wouldn't listen either. Then one night I was watching a movie in church and I knew I was missing something. I sat on the back of my dad's tractor in the middle of the night. You know what I had to do? I just said Lord, I know I'm a sinner. And I believe that Jesus is your son and died on a cross for my sins. And I ask you now to forgive me and be my savior. Boy did my life change. Of course my problems didn't go away, but at least I had someone to understand them and guide me through them. You wanna know something, Eric? We don't have to make a big production out of accepting God's gift of eternity into our lives. He hears the quietest whispering words. So do you think we can have it finished by this weekend? - Sure, give it a shot anyway. - How are you and Kelly's fish getting along? - Don't ask. She's coming by to pick them up tonight, boy did you luck out on that one. Don't ever ever offer to take care of anyone else's fish. - Finally met your match, huh? - Yeah, I guess. That reminds me, did you ever find out any of those answers to the questions in the bible? - Yes I did. But I'll tell you the truth, I didn't think you really wanted to know. - If I didn't wanna know, I wouldn't have asked. What does it say about born again? - In John 3:5, Jesus is explaining to Nicodemus about the requirements for getting into Heaven. - Okay. - One of those requirements is being born again. - But what's it mean? - Well modern Christians have adopted the phrase to mean anyone who acknowledges their sins, confesses them to God, and takes Him up on His offer to pardon them. - But what does it say about why I have to pray to God if God already knows what I want? - Prayer is our way of maintaining our relationship with God. - But what does it say in the bible? - In First John 5, 14 and 15, it says prayer is the assurance we have in approaching God. In other words, if we ask Him for something, according to His will, He hears us and we know that if He hears us, whatever we ask will be given to us. Until you know the Lord, Rob, you're not in His will. And the promises that apply to Christians don't apply to other people. That wouldn't give me much peace of mind. - I have peace of mind. - Fine, but why have peace of mind for 70 years or so and then go into eternity without God? - Kelly, hi! - Hi Rob, I came for my fish. - Great. - Rob, what happened? God, they're beautiful, they look better than when I left them, how did you do it? Oh I was so afraid that they might get the ick. - Ick? - Yeah, it's a common disease fish can get, kinda like a cold and there's nothing you can do about it unless you catch it. They die. You're such a sweetheart, I hope they weren't too much trouble. - Trouble? What trouble could little fish be? - Well I inflated the (mumble), initiated CPR, it was so frustrating Betsy because if I had someone with me it could have gone better. - Kelly, these things take time and patience to work out -- - Oh Kelly! Kelly, excuse me, could we talk? - I'll talk to you later, Kelly. - You lost a patient on Saturday. - Yes. - And you think that if you'd had another nurse on board you would have had a better chance? - Yes. - Kelly, for the record, I know that you handled the situation the best way you could under the circumstances. I wanna know, why were you flying alone? - It was busy in ER, it was busy in ICU, it was a weekend, there was no volunteers signed up. - I'm sorry, Kelly, you know that doesn't happen very often. - That doesn't help that boy, does it? He was my responsibility! - You don't know that having a second crew member would have made the difference. - And you don't know that it wouldn't. I'm gonna be candid with you, Linda. I think I know what's clouding the issue. I think that somewhere in your subconscious you're afraid to recommend my suggestions, it just might appear to be a conflict of interest. - A conflict of interest? - Linda, your husband wants to be in the Life Flight program, and if you recommend my suggestions it just might appear you're serving your own self interest and not the hospital's! Linda, what's it gonna take?! - Excuse me, Linda, Mr. Overton would like to see you. - [CJ] Whenever I get discouraged or lack the faith to go for it, I use this to remind me to go to God's word and claim His promise. (dramatic orchestral music) - Ready? - Got it. - Set it clear over there. (dramatic synthesizer music) - [Kelly] Rick, we're running out of time. Look, I'm lighter than you are, you just hold onto me, I'm gonna go out. (dramatic orchestral music) - Hiya, Eric, how you doing? Five, please. - He starts therapy today, he's doing real well. - Well Michael's kept me informed about you and I'm happy you're doing so well, keep up the good work. Bye, Eric. (knocking) - [CJ] Come in. - Hi, guys. - Oh hi, Kelly. - They're so pretty. - Well I thought I'd come by to see if you could still wiggle your toes. - Oh I think mine is still thawing out. - I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw you two in the water. CJ, you've pulled enough people out of situations like that to know better. - Kelly, I don't know how to say this, but thank you. - Well that's just what we do Linda, but not quite so dramatically. (knocking) - [CJ] Hi, Frank. - How's everybody doing? - Great. - Kelly, we sure appreciated your efforts yesterday. I heard all about it and you're to be commended. - Well it was really a team effort, but thank you. - Kelly, I know that you've been making a great deal of effort to try to get additional full time crew. I know you understand that the reason that your request was denied was just a matter of priority. In spite of what happened yesterday, those priorities haven't changed, but there may be something that we can still do to help meet your realities as well as ours. Our current line of thinking is this. We could hire paramedics from other rescue units on a part time basis. Since they normally work 24 hour shifts every three days, we could hire them to work for us in-between. - That's great! - Actually, it was Linda's idea, and we feel it may have some merit. - That'll give you the consistency that you want with a price that we can live with. - I love it. I just love it! Any chance of me getting a couple of male nurses on board? - That depends on their schedules. - How about a frostbitten paramedic? - Well if he wants to fill out an application. - I just knew God had big plans for me. I knew it. (soft piano music) - Hi! - Hi! - What's with the happy face? - What is that supposed to mean, I walk around grumpy? - No, you just look extra happy. - We got our people. - We did?! - Yup. - When did you find out? - Five minutes ago. - You're something else, you know that, Kelly? - I didn't do it alone. - I'm talking about yesterday. - You weren't so bad yourself. - Did turn out okay, didn't it? - Yeah. - Kelly, I have a confession to make. - I didn't know you were into that sort of thing. - My conscience has been bothering me. You know those fish that you took home? They weren't the ones that you brought over. - I know. - You do? - Of course. - Now I'm embarrassed. - Don't be. The question is did you learn anything from the experience. - I think you know I did, or you wouldn't have asked. Those fish just showed me how really vulnerable you can, how helpless you can be in a situation that you can't control. It's kinda scary. - I know. - You think that God had anything to do with what happened at the lake yesterday? - Do you really wanna know what I think? - (sighs) No, I'm just making conversation. - Goodnight, Rob. - Kelly! - Yeah? - What do you think I should do? - I'd go for it!
