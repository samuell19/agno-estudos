(log chiming) (bright music) - How is it. - Delicious, as usual. I guess my cooking lessons paid off. - That's right, I learned from the best. - Hmm-mm. - I got a career woman that can cook her ass off. - (giggles) That is right... In the kitchen, in the courtroom, and in the bedroom. - Ooh, she's bad. (Jade giggling) (bright music continues) - Donovan, are you serious? We talked about this over, and over, and over again. No! I went to Harvard. I worked my ass off to be at that firm. I'm not about to just quit my job because I'm marrying a football player. - Excuse me? You're not just marrying a football player. You're marrying the recipient of the highest contract of the season, "and arguably", says ESPN, "the best receiver in the NFL." I'm not just a football player. - That's not what I said, Donovan. - That is what you said, Jade. - Babe, look- - No, you look. All right, when we get married, you're leavin' that job, that's it! (Jade scoffs) - Why? - Because it's not ideal for our lifestyle, Jade. My wife can't work. Who's gonna raise my kids? Who's goin' to all my games? I'm not having you hounded by tabloid paparazzi every time you step out of a courtroom. And I'm damn sure not having hotshot lawyers and big-time judges hitting on you just because you're my wife! It's not gonna happen! - You're right. - Thank you. Finally, some common sense on this issue. - I can't marry you. - What? Are you fucking kidding me? No, no, no, are you fucking kidding me? So, you're breakin' up with me? - It's not what I said, I just said that I can't marry you. - I can't marry you. What the hell does that mean, Jade? I don't fucking believe this! You're breaking up with me! You are, you're fucking breaking up with me! - Calm down. Sit down. Stop getting so angry. - I, I'm not angry, okay? I'm mad! Okay, you wanna do this? Gimme back the ring! - What? - You heard me! Gimme back the ring! - Three years of my life being completely committed to you, and after everything that I've put up with, you have the audacity to ask me for a fucking ring back! This shit is barely a consolation prize! - Gimme back the ring! - Excuse me? - You heard me. Give me back the ring! - Give me back the coochie! - Huh? - You heard me. (Donovan Stuttering) Uh um I. (imitates Donovan stuttering) Uh Um. That's what I thought! You'll get your ring back when you figure that shit out. (door slams) - Give it back?

I can't contain myself any longer. First, thank you for taking me out to get my mind off things, but I need to vent. Can we talk about this ring? That Donovan thinks he's getting back. W- w- wait, what? Girl, he asked you to give the ring back? - What kind of man- - Aah, don't even get me started. Okay, the fact that he thinks that cheap-ass ring even begins to measure the time that you've committed is ridiculous. Men who ask for the ring back... ♪ Are the worst ♪ The worst. No decency.

I was thinking about quitting my career. - Hm-mm. - Ugh. - Why can't he be more like Richard? - Oh. - You guys are perfect. - Please, all that glitters is not gold. If he asks me to have a baby one more time. - Mm. - Girl, you give him one? - Brooklin, please, I am not having any babies anytime soon. That is not what we went to Harvard for. - What about you? - Oh, Jade, you know I do not want to marry Eric. - Okay, then why are you with him? - Girl, you know that hose is relentless. - You gotta be kidding me. - Girl, the penis is too good, I cannot give that up. - Four years and no ring. No penis is that good, Brooklin. - Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, let's take it back. So you told him to give the goodies back. What did he say? - Ooh, I would've loved to see his face. - Nothing. He didn't say anything? - Nothing! - No, he just stood there with this look on his face, and his mouth was wide open, and he was like. - What? - (laughs) Okay, okay, well, well how long did he stand there with his mouth open? - Yeah. And how wide was it open? - Let's put it this way; his mouth was open wider and longer than Kim K on her knees in a Super Bowl locker room. - Oh my God. My God. (laughing) I can't, I can't. - No. - No. - No. (gentle hip hop music) - Chad, my glass is empty. - Well, I hope you're at least enjoying yourself lately, because mopin' around is not cool. - (chuckles) Yeah, man, it's freakin' weak.

Here we go. - How does the fastest man in the NFL quit while he's still on top of his game, huh, how? - I'll tell you how. I got one of two options. One: continue and keep getting my ass busted up by these big-ass looking motherfuckers every week. Or two: retire, spend some time with my beautiful wife and my two kids. Hm? - Yeah, you know what I mean, man. We're just gonna miss you. - I know. But listen, I took this team to three Super Bowls, and mentored all of you since you were rookies.

Now, I insist that I do the dishes. - Be my guest. You know, I gotta admit, I never thought you'd be in my place. - I know, right? - Especially after you dissed like that in the gym restroom. - I didn't dis you, I was engaged. - Yeah, so was I. - But who knew, I'd end up breaking up with my fiance, and then you would break up with your fiance too. - I know, right. (upbeat music) (Tatiana chattering indistinctly with water running) - Donovan, do you know what I mean? - (chuckles) I know exactly what you mean. - So, now that we had dinner, what's up for dessert? - Me? - Hmm, that sounds yummy. (upbeat music) - Good morning, beautiful. - Good morning, handsome. - What is it with every woman I'm with leaving me in the morning? - Well, this woman has a job. - You go to work dressed like that? - (chuckles) Owning a boutique is not easy. In order to sell sexy dresses, you have to wear sexy dresses. - Well, you're definitely wearing the sexy. - Can I ask you something? Where did all this bright green and yellow come from? It's very beautiful, but a bit unusual for a guy like you. - It's lemon lime, those are my fiance's favorite colors. - Lemon and lime. Lovely. You still miss her, you know? - No, I don't. And I hate lemon, and hate lime, and I especially hate yellow Lamborghinis. (sighs) I'm changing everything in here soon. - What are you changing it to? - Black. All black. Yeah, I'm gonna like that. - Well, as long as your heart doesn't turn all black, you don't wanna lose your light. The light inside of you. - Hey, Tatiana. Thanks. - Thank you too. ♪ Do it again for me ♪ ♪ Otra vez ♪ ♪ Do it again for me ♪ ♪ Otra vez, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ - (laughing) Oh, Geraldine, you know it! This man is so fine.

(gentle hip hop music) - My man, heard about your date with Heidi Millionairess Monroe. - Yeah. - Man, I heard you had her all over this loft. - (chuckles) Yeah, pretty much. - You lucky dog. Yo, Donovan, you gotta stop sipping that wine and get yourself a man's drink. - You know, Pete, I don't drink that hard stuff, man. I drive exotic sports cars. - Exotic sports cars? Man, what the hell's that gotta do with anything. Aah, man, I'm tired. I gotta go take a nap. Where are my keys? - Oh, I got you. You know I'm not gonna give you these keys. - Ah, Donovan. Come on, man, I can drive. - Yeah, you can drive your ass right over there to that futon bed. Come on, let's go. - Okay, lemme go lay down, take a nap, I'm tired. Yeah. - Yeah? - Man, this is no futon bed. - Shut up! Yes it is. See. - What the hell is this? A transformer sofa? - Lay down man. - Man, this is some fake shit. - Raise up, man. There you go. All right, now don't puke on my sofa, all right? - I got you, man. I got you. (Donovan sneezes) (doorbell rings) (sneezes) Hey, Ms. SinClair, what brings you by tonight? - Hi, honey. Well, I told you I was going to make you something for your cold. - Come in, be my guest. - Thank you. - What do you got for me? - I whipped up the perfect remedy. - Uh, Mr. SinClair, that's an interesting outfit you're wearing tonight. You got a man at your place? - Ah, this old thing? As for the man, I'm working on it. - So what is this? - It's called a hot toddy. - Ooh, Ms. SinClair, did you say hot titty? - Oh, Donovan, you are so funny. Not hot titty, hot toddy. - Oh, hot toddy. (chuckles) Thought you said hot titty. - That might come later. Now, it's made from herbal tea, lemon juice, and a splash of whiskey. Drink it up. - Sounds good. It taste good too. - Mm-hmm. Donovan? Donovan, are you okay? (tense humming sound) Donavan? Donovan, are you okay? (Ms. SinClair giggling) - Hmm. Oh my God! Ms. SinClair, what, what happened? - Well, you got your hot titty. - Oh my God, Ms. SinClair, what, what did we do? - Oh my God, what didn't we do? Hot damn, I feel 25 again! - Why, Ms. SinClair, I'm blown away! - Ooh, was I that good? (chuckling) - Huh? (upbeat music) - Perry? Perry! Perry, what are you doing sleeping down here on the sofa? Where are the boys? - Um. Hey, baby! They're upstairs. - Did you take them to the park? - (yawning) Yep, and they wore me out! - Mm-hmm. - But, hey, I got you something. (giggles) - What? - Mm-hmm. - (gasps) Chocolate caramel, my favorites. - Mm-hmm, just like your man. (both chuckling) Now come and gimme some. - Ugh, Nathan Perry, I just gave you some this morning. I'm exhausted. - Are you serious? - Yes. - This morning? That was 100 years ago. Don't you love me no more? - Hm, no. I love my chocolates and my bed. - Well, in that case, give me that and come and get it. Come and get it. - You know what? (gentle hip hop music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - What's up, lush? I've been calling you all night, you got a hangover or what? - Yeah, a love hangover. Man, I met this beautiful girl at the club last night. (sighs) I brought her home, put it on her real good. She put me to sleep and was gone before I even woke up. I don't even know her name, man. It was a love story. - Man, you better check yourself, you're gettin' outta control. - (chuckles) Hey, you guys started this shit? - Yeah, and we created a monster. Hey, you coming to the gala this week? - Oh yes, sir. - That's cool. Show up early, so we can get a drink or somethin'. - I got you, man. Ouch! - Man, you okay? - Yeah, man, I'm, I'm fine. - Donovan, what, what's going on, man? - Dude, my nuts are killing me. Oh, I'm itching like crazy. - Go take a hot shower, you've been laying in those nasty ass sheets. It's probably just jock itch or something. - I don't know. Well, I gotta go, man. Look, the shower is screaming. (Donovan moaning) (phone ringing) - Yo, what's up, Dono'? - Chad, man, my nuts are killing me. - Seriously? - Yeah, man, they won't stop itching. Dude, I'm fuckin dying. Oh my God, man, you gotta help me, please. - All right, all right, all right, calm down, let me think. Um, is it the type of itch, when you scratch it, it goes away and then it comes back later? Or is it the type of itch, when you scratch it, it just gets like worse and worse, instantly? - Yeah, that one! That's it, that's the one! - Oh no. - Oh no! What? - Houston, we have a problem. - Chad, what, w- what's wrong? - Dono, you've got crabs, my man. - Crabs! What the fuck is crabs? - Well, they're these little crab like parasites that lay eggs, and hatch, and grow on your nuts, and then they suck the blood from your nuts. And when you scratch, it irritates them, so they dig their little claws in deeper in your nuts, causing severe pain. - Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh God! Oh God! Oh my God! - Dono? - Oh my God! Oh God! - Dono, are you there? - Oh God! - Hey, not to worry, man, I'm on my way. I'm gonna get some medicine, we're gonna clear it right up. Hold tight, man. Hold your nuts! - Oh my God! Oh! Oh God! Oh! Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ah! (upbeat music) (Donovan moaning and screaming) - Lathered it in real good, like shampoo, but don't use all of it, save half for a second application tomorrow, just in case. Pretty soon those little critters will rinse right off. - [Donovan] That's disgusting! - Not as disgusting as you hoein' around. - [Donovan] Hey, not funny, Chad! (Chad chuckles) (Donovan chuckles) - How you feeling, my man? - Oh, I feel one million. You saved my life, my dog. Whew. - So you heard from Jade lately? - Man, Jade who? I ain't thinkin' about her. Why? - Well, apparently she's not thinking about you either. She's been seeing her old lawyer boyfriend. - That DA clown! Hmm, that dude's a loser. Jade needs a real man. - Well, it's a good thing you're over her. - Definitely over her, man. Definitely. - (chuckles) Yeah right, I can see that. Anyways, I gotta go. Make sure your housekeeper destroys those sheets. - Oh, sheets, spread, pillows, everything, gone. - Might wanna have her throw away those shorts you had on yesterday too. - Done. Bro, you saved me, man. - Hey, I'm good. Just in case. But I'll see you tomorrow? - Yeah. - After that second application. (chuckles) - Man, whatever. (chuckles) (Donovan sighs) - How do I look, gents? - Hm, fantabulous. (chuckles) But I look even more fantabulous. - Who's the most grown and sexy? That would be me. - Chad, fix my bow tie, please. - Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the flyest of them all. We got Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, and Marcus.

We're all dressed and ready to go. Do you realize how many women are gonna be here? And plus, it's HIV awareness, you can't be late. - [Donovan] Listen, man, I'm just gonna have to meet you at the auditorium. - Donovan, are you sure? Chad and Pete are gonna be pissed. - [Donovan] Just tell them I'm on the way. I'll see you soon, alright? (phone beeps) - Hey, handsome. - Hey, baby. Damn, baby! - (chuckles) You like? - I adore. - Hmm. I'm so in love with my wife right now. Let's go upstairs real quick. - (gasps) Whoo! (chuckles) Put me down. - Mm. - Oh my gosh! Come on now, the driver's waiting outside, and you know you are the opening speech, you cannot be late. - I'm so nervous. - Mm-hmm. - How are the boys? - They're good. They're good. They're upstairs with the nanny, all right? Now, let's hear your opening speech. - Okay. Good evening, I'm Nate Perry, and welcome to Athletes Against HIV, promoting treatment and awareness for children with HIV. (hands clapping) - (giggles) Perfect. All right, ready? - Ready. - Let's go. - (sighs) What the hell happened to Dono'? - I don't know. - Did you call him back? - Yeah, I kept calling him over and over, and he just wouldn't answer. - Did you say somethin' stupid? Did you piss him off, Marcus? Be honest. - No. No, I mean, we were joking around, but he said he was on his way. - Well, it's definitely not like Donovan to just stand us up like that. - Hm-mm. - No. - Look! Guys, look! - NFL Superstar Donovan Steele, airlifted here after a near fatal crash. Apparently, Steele was on his way to a fundraiser to benefit children with HIV.

And I know that you don't wanna put yourself in a vulnerable position. I mean, you care about him and you wanna be there for him, but you don't wanna compromise your integrity.

I know you're the best at what you do, and I'm here to listen. - Well, the good news is that your ribs and the tissue around it has been healing properly, but for a moderate recovery it's gonna take at least six months. Don't worry, we got the best therapy and best treatment possible for you. But for your bones to heal properly and for full recovery, it's gonna take at least a year. And even then, I'm gonna have to evaluate your physical condition. - God! - I know, I know, it's not what you wanna hear, but it's too soon for me to tell you otherwise. Look, you're gonna be okay. - Okay? You know what a year could do to my life? Dr. Westley, if I don't train for a year, my career's over. - Donovan, anything is possible.

Hmm, I'm real with my feelings... And 100% honest. - Are you for real? - Marcus! What? When it comes to women, you're the most dishonest guy I know. - You just believe your lies, and that's where the crazy comes in. - Whoa, whoa, I am not crazy! - No, you're not crazy, Marcus. You've just been hit in the head way too many times. We completely understand. - Man, forget you guys! Watch the game! - Well, dudes, however God wired us, whatever I coulda said, whatever I coulda did, doesn't really matter now. Fucked up my career, fucked up with my girl, fucked up my life.

I did not bring my butt here every day, waiting on you, for you to do some dumb shit like that. I'll choke you out right now. You think you got cracked ribs? You're about to have a cracked neck. - Guys, guys, fellas. I'm okay, all right, I'm just a little depressed. - Well, you better un-depress yourself real fast. - No, guys, I don't trust him.

Honestly, I don't know what I'd without you. You always have my back, and I love you. You're my brothers. - You damn right we are. (Donovan sighs) - I can do this. I'm gonna get my shit together. I'm gonna go to therapy every day, do exactly what the doctor says. And next year, I'll play again. If not in the NFL, then maybe Canada. Hell, I'll even coach high school football if I have to. Whatever happens, I'll be okay. I lost my career. Lost my girl. But I'm not gonna lose my life. I got way too many people fighting for me. I'm not gonna give up. I promise. (sighs) Well, I gotta go take a piss. I'll be right back. - Yo, guys, we gotta call Jade. - Yeah, we do. (doorbell ringing) - Chad! What the hell? - Good news, Dono', good news. Come sit. - What's goin' on, man? This better be good. - Come on, dude. - Okay. - You ready for this? - Yeah. - Remember your endorsement deal with Universe Nutrition, the D. Steele line of fitness supplements they were launching? - Yeah, and they let me go when I got injured. - Well, not exactly. I made some phone calls, and the deal's back on the table with an expanded offer! - Expanded offer? Wait, what? What would they want with an unemployed athlete? - Donovan, you're bigger than an athlete. You're a hero. Social media's been blowing up with millions supporting your courage and recovery. They've got a whole new marketing campaign based specifically around your accident and your miraculous recovery. - But I haven't recovered yet. - Yeah, but you will, and they know you will. Listen, ex NFL star almost killed in crash. He loses everything but his will to live. He makes a miraculous recovery in superhuman time with his own supplement line. D. Steele: Recovery for champions. And you become one of the biggest fitness stars in America. It's all laid out for you, Oprah, Good Morning America, magazine covers, a book deal about the accident and how you beat the odds. Plus, Lamborghini wants to use you for their driving responsibly campaign. - That's unbelievable. - Right! All you gotta do is heal those bones, maintain this physique, and build your muscle back, then it's a done deal. - How did you guys make this happen? - We met with the executives at Universe Nutrition and told them your story, about how fast you're recovering, how determined you are, and how you refuse to give up on life just because of football. So why should they give up on you? They agreed. The rest is history, my man. - Man, I don't even know what to say. I mean, I, I can't thank you enough. - Dude, there's more. They wanna design an entire protein shake line, inspired by you. - We're talkin' D. Steele protein shakes? - Even better. Muscle Monkey protein shakes. (imitates monkey) - Muscle Monkey? - Yeah. - Muscle Monkey protein shakes? - [Chad] Yeah, dude. - Who in the hell got that idea? - Pete pitched it to 'em the other day. They loved it. - I kinda like it. Monkeys are super resilient and stronger than most humans. - Right. - My man!

I was mean. Said some pretty hurtful things. - Jade, you weren't being mean, you were just keepin' it real. Look, I need to tell you something. I understand now why you need your own career, and success, and money. You never know when the tables are gonna turn. Yeah. And now that I'm a broke and busted motherfucker, I understand why I would need a woman like you in my life. - Well, my daddy raised me to be independent, to never have to sacrifice my integrity or independence for anyone. - I get it. That's exactly the way I'm gonna raise my daughter. - Hm. - Jade, you're gonna make some man so lucky someday. - Open your card. (both giggling) - Stone and Steele... Friends forever. This means everything to me. - Now open this. - What is this? (bright music) - Donovan Steele, will you take me, Jade Stone as your wife? - You're proposing to me. You're taking me back! Oh my god! Baby, I missed you so much. Jade, I can't breathe without you. I'm so sorry. I'm dying. Please. Please, just take me back. Please, forgive me. - Listen, no. I let you down. I walked out on you. You really needed me, I wasn't there. Please forgive me. - Yes! Yes! Yes! - But what made you change your mind? I mean, how? - Let's just say, three little monkeys. (Donovan chuckles) (doorbell rings) - I'll get it. - Hey, if it's that Heidi Hoe, you tell her where to go. - I'll do that. - Hey, if it's any of them other hoes, you can tell them where to go too. - I'll do that too. Oh, It's Ms. SinClair. - Ms SinClair! (playful intense hip hop music with rap vocal) ♪ - Ooh, Ms. SinClair, did you say hot titty? - Oh, Donovan, you are so funny. Not hot titty, hot toddy. - Oh, hot toddy. Thought you said hot titty. - That might come later.
