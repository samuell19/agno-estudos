"BUTTERFLY SLEEP" Subbed & Translated by Ayame Nakayama Miho Kim Jae Wook Nagase Masatoshi Ishibashi Anna Katsumura Masanobu Sugata Shun Mashima Hidekazu Shibuya Asami Writer & Director: Jeong Jae Eun There's nothing I can do about it, Tonbo. I shouldn't force myself if I can't. There will be more days where I can write more, right? Tomorrow, I'll challenge myself to do something new. I wonder if I really can... "Love is the hunt of life." "Chasing after the person you want." "Shooting arrows of words or gestures." "The reality was that he had a young wife waiting for him at home." "The reality was that she had an older husband waiting for her at home." "The realization in that moment was helplessness for Natsuko." "She could only rely on herself for the sake of winning love." "If she's weaker than her prey," "then her prey will definitely be unobtainable." "When Natsuko took off his clothes and held him..." "She felt a sense of superiority as a living thing." That's the end. [Novelist: Ayamine Ryoko-sensei] [Reading and Analysis of "Midsummer Feast"] Ah... I'm a little embarrassed. I wrote this novel when I was 30 years old, so it's a bit immature. I have never stood before my readers like this. I always wanted to hide behind my novels, but recently, I had a change of heart. I've realized that the most important thing is to put myself first before my novels. So, I wanted to show everyone who I am. From now on, I won't hide behind my novels. Does this book really have to be used as a teaching material in class? It's because it's a best-seller. I also love that book. I've read it many times. See? Even the students says things like that. I'm a long-time fan of yours. It's an honor to meet you. If there's anything you don't know, you can talk to Anna-kun. Since I brought you here, my stock at the school has risen a bit. But I'm a bit worried. Will you be okay? I guess so. I started writing a new novel, but it's not really progressing well. Don't push yourself too hard. If you keep yourself healthy, healthy novels will be created. Ryoko. Alcohol is really bad for you. I really hate when you say that! Even if you really hate it, you shouldn't do things that are bad for you! Have you read this book? "The Death of Ivan Ilyich" Huh? I was planning on reading it tomorrow. Don't take it. Then, what about "To Live"? "To Live"? Weren't we going to see it together? The movie, "To Live". Were we? The story of what the protagonist did for the residents after being diagnosed with cancer. Wouldn't that be a good topic? So, that's the lecture you want to do? I want to spend a meaningful time with the students. Ryoko. Whenever you're having a difficult time, tell me. I'm really thirsty... Ah, the tea. Sorry. I completely forgot. Sensei. This is Chan Hae. He's taking a leave of absence now, but we were studying together up until last semester. She came as a guest lecturer at our graduate school. She's the novelist, Ayamine Ryoko-sensei. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm So Chan Hae. So Chan Hae-kun? Yeah, Chan Hae is an exchange student from South Korea. Ah. Please give us some delicious food. Today, I'll pay for everyone. Hey, hey! Ryoko... Ryoko. I'm fine. Stop it. I'm fine! I have to drink on days like this! You promised you'd only drink a little. I'm fine! Stop it! Ah, I have a favor to ask! Sensei. Could you autograph this? She's well-known for not autographing anything. Who said such a thing? Here. Excuse me! Is there anyone here? Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me. Hold on, what are you doing? What... Where did I leave it... Sensei, what's wrong? It must be here. I have to find it. I'm looking for a fountain pen. A fountain pen? Ah... I did clean here earlier today, but I didn't find any fountain pen. Where is it? It absolutely has to be here! I always write novels with that fountain pen. If I don't have it, then I can't write! I absolutely must find it. I can't write properly with anything else! Um... There are things I have been surprised by since coming to Japan, but when it comes to losing something, it will surely come back. That's right. Japan is like that. Please take a rest. I'll look for it. A fountain pen... Ow... Chan Hae, wake up! You overslept? Well... The fountain pen... Fountain pen? Late last night, suddenly... Ah... What? This isn't yours, right? Yeah, it's not. Seriously! This belongs to the novelist from last night! Ah, really? - What? - What do you mean, "what"? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing... Honestly... It seemed expensive, so I took it. It seems to be worth 1 million yen. 1 million yen?! The nameplate said "Matsumura" on it, so I thought I was at the wrong place. It's because I'm divorced, so I'm using my maiden name. In my next book, I plan to publish it under the name 'Matsumura Ryoko', not 'Ayamine Ryoko'. What's the dog's name? Tonbo (Dragonfly). Isn't it perfect? Tonbo... Ah... I found it. Ah... King Fountain Pen, thanks for coming back. King Fountain Pen? You didn't know? ...No. Your name is...? So Chan Hae. So Chan Hae-kun is sitting on Queen Chair, but he doesn't know it? I am? So Chan Hae-kun, do you have some time? Hey! Tonbo! Hey! Tonbo! Tonbo! Hey, Tonbo! What's his name? Oh... Tonbo. - Tonbo? - Tonbo? - Tonbo? - Tonbo? Tonbo-chan! Tonbo is happy. Thank you. It was good exercise. Chan Hae-kun. You must have been surprised that I asked you to walk him. No, it's all right. Really? From now on, could you take Tonbo for a walk once a week? Is that okay? I've been looking for someone to do this as a part-time job. But Tonbo seems to really like you. I'll think about it. I'll be leaving. Tonbo, bye-bye. Welcome~ Chan Hae, you're late! Fountain pen-san. She's really amusing. I mean... She's a bit crazy and strange. You're really good at attracting older ladies, huh? Please stop it. Hey, did you buy the enoki mushrooms and asparagus? Ah, I forgot... You... Hello, there are 3 of us. Ah, welcome! Huh? Tonbo? Ah, Tonbo~ - Hello. - Hello. Hey, Tonbo! Come here. Tonbo hasn't liked showers since he was a puppy. - You feel refreshed, Tonbo? - Okay. You feel refreshed? I have younger brothers. They're twins. They also didn't like washing their hair. Wow... Amazing... It's like a bookstore. A bookstore that doesn't sell books. Having such a study is really impressive. It's neatly organized. Horizontally, it's ordered by the date, and vertically, it's ordered by author. It can seem neatly organized to some people, but it's also kind of dull. In this world, there aren't many coincidences, right? It's really nice when you're looking for something you need, but it's really sad when you're choosing something among the organized sections. I want to find something by coincidence. I know in my head... in this area... this must be the corner for Matsumoto Seicho's books. And when I open my eyes... As expected, it's his book. Amazing. I hate having those kind of memories in my head where everything's so organized. Although these memories will soon become a mess... What? Here. How do you want to reorganize them? I want them to be reorganized in a visually beautiful way. For example... This book is blue, right? One of the bookshelves should only have books with blue covers. Ah... So, you want the books to be organized by color? That's right. If it's organized by color, then the memories in my head will reset, and I will be able to choose a book freely without prejudice, right? I think it will be much easier than you think. Don't forget about color gradation​ when organizing, okay? Please leave it to me. Olé! Tonbo! I think I may be unconsciously envious of the study in your house. In my dream, I was writing a book in your study as if it were my own. I thought if I had a nice study like that, even I could write well. That's just wishful thinking, right? If you had a study, then you'd be able to write well. Right? That's what I think. That really is it... Do you want to be an author? Chan Hae-kun, where do you live? My home? There's a room in the storehouse of the restaurant where the employees rest. I live there. I don't have to pay rent, so they really helped me. Come to think of it, since coming to Japan, I've never had a place of my own where I can truly relax. ['Crying in Autumn Breeze'] ['Humanless Love'] ['Man Next Door'] ['First Doubts'] ['Dull Man'] ['Midsummer Feast'] ['Winter Cherry Blossoms'] ['Midsummer Feast' by Ayamine Ryoko] [Ayamine Ryoko] "For Saori and Kousuke, that small boarding room was..." "a heaven-like place." "There weren't any places for them to go together," "and there wasn't anywhere special that they wanted to go." "In a room that was so small that they could hear each other's breathing," "they could feel each other perfectly." "It would be nice if this room could be even smaller." "That's what Saori thought." My lipstick is OK. My eyebrows are OK. First... The refrigerator​ door is OK. The water supply is OK. The stove is OK. Tonbo's meal is OK. Your water is also OK. Later, Tonbo. I'm leaving. Hello! Hello! Do you like reading books here? Yeah! Because my house is noisy. I see. Have fun, okay? Miss! Your ears! Thanks. What I wanted to write about in "Midsummer Feast" was the mysterious relationship between me and my husband who was also my mentor. I was still young when I wrote that book, so when the immense love and respect I had towards him suddenly cooled down in an instant, I remember being really shocked by that. However, many readers were only interested in young politicians. When writing a novel, the most important thing is how strong your own emotions are when writing. I think that's the foundation and starting point of every story. [Publication Party for "The Witching Hour" by Ayamine Ryuji] Today was a great success. Thank you very much. Please take care of us again next week. Yes. I'll be leaving. Thank you. Goodbye. When was the last time we met? I think it's been 5 or 6 years. I see. Time really passes quickly. Your novel this time seems quite good. How are the sales? You should also publish a new book. Once your book sells well, my book also sells well. Because of your novels, there were people who thought my career as a novelist was over. But, you know... This time... expressing my feelings really helped. Stop it. When that book was published, as if it wasn't enough to be cheated on by my wife, that embarrassment was also made public. Enough of that talk. I was also miserable at the time. Living back then was the most miserable... You came here today, so don't pretend like that. We're comrades in arms. We're destined to fight until the end. Which of us will be the winner? Everyone is paying attention to us. So write quickly. Goodbye. I came to talk to you about something. I'm... in the early stages of Alzheimer's. The same disease that my late mother had. I don't know what will happen from now on. I've suddenly become worried about it. About you. What I learned from you. What I did to you. I might forget everything. It isn't finished yet. If there's anything you don't like, please let me know. This green shelf... is lined up to seem like a big mountain. You noticed right away. Well... I put a lot of effort in this part. That's what I thought. Thanks. Wow... This became blue. This has a rainbow gradation​. These are the warm colors. These are both new and old. These are monochrome. Wow, amazing. How will you look for a book from now on? I won't look for a book. From now on, these books are like ornaments for me. I was really motivated while organizing. There were many authors I didn't know about. There were also a lot of books I've never read before. You don't need to read all of them. All writers say the same thing. "Don't waste your life by looking at a book written by someone else." "If you have that kind of time, write your own book." If you have these many books in front of you, it feels burdensome, doesn't it? There are too many books in the world. To be honest... I never really thought about writing a book. Someday, a time will come when you'll think, "I absolutely have to write." Wait for it. Well, that's what all writers say. I handwrite my novels. But my wrist isn't really in good condition. It's also hard for my editor who has to type my writing into a computer when editing. Every time, my editor asks, "When are you going to buy a computer?" Should I teach you how to use a computer? No. For my novel this time, I want to write using words, not characters. Do you mean using words through writing on paper? I've decided to audio record my words, and my publisher will receive the manuscript that you'll type for me. Hold on... My Japanese ability isn't... I don't think my Japanese is very good. I think your Japanese will definitely improve through this kind of work. Yes... I'll lend you this room. You can stay here. Ah... yes... Maybe I'm the one being trapped. What do you mean? Is this the next part of the female writer series plot? Aren't there people who make a bucket list of things they want to do before they die? Yeah. I think she's using me to complete her bucket list. Just like today! She said, "You can stay here in this room." Hey, fountain pen! Why are you so impatient? What are you saying now? Hold on. Maybe she's just showing her humanist side. Yeah, that's right. Her humanist side. What the heck are you saying all of a sudden? Fountain pen is just showing her humanist side. She's just like me. Didn't I also tell you to also stay at the restaurant? She's overflowing with humanity. So, when do you plan to start living there? Well, if I were you, I'd start living there tonight. However... Be sure to lock the door for the room when you sleep. It's dangerous. Hehehe... - Excuse me. - You're laughing... "Ever since she was a kid, Saori thought this each time she had to fight against society." "That she was small and not worth anything." "Even when she was with her family..." "No, especially during the times she was with her family..." "That's what she felt." Ah. This kanji character is wrong. What? Which one? This one. Ah, this one. Japanese is difficult, isn't it? I'm usually not really sure on which kanji character to use. What do you think of the story so far? How should I say this? It feels sexy. How so? I could feel the scent. The scent? Yeah. There's bound to be different kinds of scents, right? Well... When Saori came closer to Kousuke, he was surprised, right? But Saori hugged him earlier. So at that moment, it felt as if I could feel the same scent of Kousuke that Saori had felt. "On the day she slept with Kousuke." "She realized that was a mistake." "When Saori traced the outline of his chest with her finger, he would hold his breath." "When Saori lightly nibbled on Kousuke's shoulder," "Kousuke would let out a small sigh." How's this part? "As Saori hesitated on what to paint," "she animatedly gestured the brush to her lips," "so Kousuke couldn't take his eyes off of her." What do you mean by "she animatedly gestured"? They're staying at a room in Saori's boarding house. They're close enough to feel each other's breath and body temperature. What do you think that feels like? Saori is painting a picture here. Kousuke is watching her nearby. Saori puts the brush to her lips. Animatedly... Not like that. Like this, like this. Ah... It shouldn't be "animatedly". It should be "captivatingly". Captivatingly? Do you know the meaning of "amorous"? I do. "Captivatingly" is a more gentle way of describing the word "amorous". It's like the person watching is blending into the other person. It's like that... Please write a short novel. Anything is fine. As long as the story has a beginning and an end. How will you write a story without a computer? I want to see the kinds of stories that you can handwrite. The subject is also important, but it's also important to directly write down your concerns by hand. Okay, go ahead. Ah, Chan Hae. Ryoko-sensei's class is really good. She doesn't teach in a formal setting and she has a lot of passion. Next week is the joint review, but why don't you come by? Your passion for literature may burn up again. If I wanted to do literature, I would've done so back in Korea. There's no need for me to do so in Japan. Seriously... Chan Hae, you always deny your true self like this. Be honest. You really do love Japanese literature. I told you I only came to Japan because the airfare was cheap. Huh? How much was the airfare? Hey, exchange student​! It's been a while. You're still in Japan? I wanted to read everyone's stories together in class today. However... I have concluded that there's no point. Looking at what you wrote about and how you wrote... There's not one person who wrote their story thoughtfully. It's too bad, but it can't be helped. This is everyone's stories. This is what we would call "trash". The writing was unprepared as if no one had anything they wanted to say, so it just seemed like you all wanted to show off. It was good-for-nothing satisfaction. There were some of you who went on for pages just describing your favorite things! Me? I said you must want to read the novel that you write! I didn't say you could write an instruction manual! Are all of you going to write novels by just bragging about what you know!? What the hell was that for? Is there something wrong with that woman's brain? Even though she's the author who wrote stupid novels. She acts like she's so great. Yoshihiro-kun. Huh? She had a point. There's no way anyone would usually show that much attitude. Who does she think she is? She's the one that looks like she writes memorandum​s in a women's magazine. So arrogant. Hey. Drop it. Huh? You're the one who leaves classes so nonchalantly. Why are you bothering me? Move! Stop it. What the hell?! Sensei! I'm sorry! Even though everyone has to work much harder, I also didn't think hard enough while writing. It's shameful. I think it's shameful. I'm sorry. Please give us another chance. Anna-san. Tell everyone to write another one. I'll read them. Let's decide what to do in the next class. Yes. Thank you. Ah... What? Ah! What's wrong? I feel a bit dizzy. Are you okay? Please hold on to my arm. Should I stay with you? I want to be alone. It's been 7 years since I came to Japan, but that was the first time I've ever seen a Japanese person get as angry as you did. That was also the first time I've gotten that angry. You thought I was strange, didn't you? Chan Hae-kun. The truth is, I... I have Alzheimer's. That may have been one of the symptoms. That was a first for me, so I'm a bit surprised. Thank you for today. "The disease is different from dementia." "Alzheimer's disease​ is a hereditary disease." "Not only do you lose your ability to remember," "your body functionality will also begin to decline." "It generally takes 3 years for someone to die from the disease." I'm okay... I'll be okay... "There is currently no cure for the disease." The thought of something like yesterday happening again... Honestly... It's scary. The symptoms can occur suddenly. It's progressing at the same rate as it did for your late mother. Sometimes, the thoughts in my head would suddenly go dark... Matsumura-san. If your house was suddenly on fire, what would you do? Well, I would quickly go outside... and I think I'd call the emergency telephone number. It seems you don't need a guardian just yet. Sensei, you have a lovely home. Are you always here...? Here you go. Thank you very much. What a nice aroma! Feel free to eat the candy, too. Thank you very much. It's my first time in your home, so I'm quite nervous. The restroom is on the second floor. Go ahead and use it now. What? If you go there, you'll understand. That everyone's the same. Is that so? Ah, by the way... Why did you want to see me today? Ah... As I mentioned earlier on the phone... Everyone worked hard on re-writing these. I really do feel like using the restroom. I'm back! Hey, hey. Okay. I haven't had a chance to read all of them yet, but they seem to be much better than before. Seems like we can use these for next week's lecture. Have you looked at mine yet? Ah... This one, right? It's about a boy who's hard to understand. I wrote it from a girl's perspective. I'll be sure to read it. "While doing many part-time jobs," "in order to pay my tuition with the money I've earned," "I headed to the bank." "I took my number ticket and waited." "I worked part-time jobs to earn money for my tuition." Please take one. Please take one. "I didn't have time to study." "Even if I have classes this semester," "I have to work part-time jobs again for next semester's tuition." "I have no time to study." "Why do I even attend university? This is stupid." "I don't have to do this." "I've come this far," "so I've come to think that next semester will be no better." "I felt proud of myself," "but at the same time I felt a sense of emptiness." The customer with the number 80, please come to the front. "With the number ticket in my hand, I left the bank." "Let's use all of this money." "For no particular reason, without leaving anything behind..." "Let's use up all the money completely." Ah, Sensei! By handwriting my story, I felt as if I could understand the protagonist for the first time. I thought I'd never be able to understand, but I was completely wrong. The story flowed naturally, and the theme was clear. It was a good story. Really? Thank you very much. You said he's addicted to playing pachinko... Ah, it's Chan Hae. He's originally an ideologist. Since he came to Japan after reading Dazai Osamu's "No Longer Human". Chan Hae... is he still doing that job of walking your dog? He's also typing my manuscript for me. For a job like that, I can also be of assistance. "As Saori closed her eyes," "she thought of Kousuke, who had gone home." "Even though he left just now," "she misses him again." "Following the sounds of the cicadas..." "Her thoughts passed through the window," "returning to her time together with Kousuke." "It hasn't even been 10 minutes since Kousuke left to go home." Yeah, yeah! Okay! Here! Here! Ah, ouch! Hey, Tonbo... You're not playing? Let's play. Here. It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay! 1... 2... 3... 4... 1... 2... 3... 4... Matsumura Ryoko-san! Please come to the examination room. Matsumura-san! Huh? Tonbo... Tonbo! Chan Hae. You took Tonbo for a walk, right? Right? Why did you take Tonbo without telling me? I didn't go to your house today. I also didn't take Tonbo for a walk today. Did something happen? The door was left open! Where is Tonbo? Bring Tonbo back now! Bring him back! Ryoko-san, wait... Please calm down. Tonbo is not there? Tonbo is not here. Come here now! Come here quickly! Tonbo! Tonbo... Tonbo! Tonbo! Tonbo! Excuse me! Tonbo... please find Tonbo! Please! What the hell! Ryoko. Let's go home. Come. Are you okay? I contacted the health care center. I think Tonbo will be found soon. Please don't worry. Are you the student that takes care of the dog? Yes. What have you been doing? You caused her a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. It's my fault. It isn't too good for you to drink alcohol, but... Drink this... Then, you should go to bed after. It's better this way. You know it's impossible for you to keep a dog in your condition, right? Even if he's found, give him away to someone. I get it. I didn't think that your condition was this bad. Shouldn't you decide soon whether you'll admit yourself to a sanatorium or elsewhere? I know. I'll make sure not to contact you like I did today. Don't worry. That's not what I'm saying. Ryoko. Think about what happened today. You're a patient. Do you understand? I want to sleep. Leave. You're the one who called me. The one who said they wanted me to come no matter what... ...was you. That wasn't me. Even if I call you again someday, that won't be me. So, don't worry about it. The number you called cannot be reached because the phone is turned off. Where...? Where was it? Where did it go?! I remember... I must remember! Ryoko-san! Ryoko-san! Ryoko-san! Why are you so late?! Why didn't you come sooner?! Why?! What happened? A towel... I'll bring you a towel. Don't go... Don't go, Chan Hae. Don't leave me alone! I don't know... The words... I don't know what to say. Just... I just... What should I do?! I... what should I do?! Chan Hae... I'm scared! Don't leave me alone... I'm begging you, don't abandon me! I had a dream... Tonbo was looking at me. And I smiled like that. As I smiled, a large tree appeared... And we both walked into the forest. You look good, you look good! What did you wish for? I prayed for someone who used up all the tuition money that he earned for 1 year. I wonder what my boyfriend needs now? He seems to have recently stopped using his money. You'll be like that forever? Well, I don't know about that. Then, who does know? When I first came to Japan, day after day, from morning to night, I lived on a strict schedule without any rest. While having horrible headaches all the time. At one point, I thought if I must live for the next 50 years... As I thought of living like that forever, I started to hate everything. So, I emptied my mind. I started living while accepting every coincidence that came to me. That's what I decided. - A coincidence? - Yes, a coincidence. I guess meeting you was also a coincidence. I also like coincidences. Even if it's a coincidence, there must be something in that to make it fate. I guess that's a scary thought, right? This moment right now may eventually disappear from my memories. This won't disappear. That's... what I believe. "Saori is painting the daisy fleabane flower." "The flower is quite small," "so she had to carefully look at it using a magnifying glass." "She counted the number of white petals it had." "Counting again and again." "She counted repeatedly." "At that moment..." "Kousuke had suddenly come back." "It had been two months." Oh... Ah... this. When typing "two months", don't use "ke", use "ka". Ah, I got the kanji character wrong again. It isn't wrong, but I don't like it. If you use "ke", you'll be laughed at. I understand. Please correct it. Yes. Where did Kousuke go with the painting of the plant that Saori made? I should've already written it. What? Kousuke is a botanist. He had Saori paint that picture, so he could to make a plant pictorial book. That's right... [Use "ka". I've told you many times!] Did you sleep well? I feel like I've slept for 100 years. Earlier, your arms were raised... You slept like a baby. In Korea, when someone does that, we say they look like a butterfly that's sleeping. We call it, "Butterfly Sleep". Such pretty words. How do you say it in Korean? "Nabijam." Nabijam... Nabijam. Nabijam... You're reading Mori Ogai's "The Wild Geese". Shouldn't you read Mori Ogai's "Youth" again? Even though the current you might think of "The Wild Geese" as a really good story. I get it. You get it? Chan Hae. I'm really disappointed in you. What on earth are you two doing? Don't judge me without knowing everything. I've always supported you in establishing a future in Japan as soon as possible, but what you ended up establishing was just a love affair between you and Sensei? Ah... I'm sorry, Sensei. It's fine. You're living with a student? Are you kidding me?! He's only there to help me on my final novel. Ryoko. Have you lost your mind? Not to mention, you have an illness. Are you trying to destroy his life? That's not what I'm doing. You're wrong. If everyone starts gossiping, what are you going to do? What will happen to the school? What will happen to me? Go home and kick Chan Hae out. Pretend you don't know anything. I'll end it soon. Until I finish writing my novel, please do your best to not do anything. I beg of you... It won't be long. Ryoko-san, let's eat dinner. I'm not hungry. That's not good. You have to eat. I made miso soup with a lot of vegetables. I see... Ah... Before you had Kousuke's father's job as a gardener, but now you changed it to carpenter... Even if it doesn't match completely... Isn't it fine? Well... You'll confuse the readers. Then... let's change it back to gardener. I'm going to the restroom. Huh... Didn't you just go to the restroom? Really? But, I want to go again. Please let me look at that. Did someone give this to you? My father-in-law gave it to me. Where's the watch? Return it. No. Come on. I don't wanna. What are you doing? No. - Return it. - No. Give it! Why did they break up so easily? Huh? What? Ah... You mean Saori and Kousuke? They like each other, so why would they break up? I don't know either. Maybe... they disagreed on something. Maybe about their sense of values or age difference. Just staying together isn't love. That's probably what Saori thought. And so she freed Kousuke. Then, what about Kousuke? Kousuke... felt relieved. That's not true. If either of them thought they were a burden... Um... if they had those kind of thoughts... So... um... Um... Since they wanted to cherish each other... They stepped aside? Yeah! That's it! That's right. That's why... Saori stepped aside. You know, Tonbo... I guess it was back when he was about this small. I took him to the park for the first time, but he kept pestering me many times to take his leash off. There was no one around, so I took his leash off for a while. And then, I lost sight of him, just like that. I looked for quite a long time, but I saw on some concrete pavement on the other side of the park and there was a 'No Trespassing' tape in front of it. There's no way Tonbo would understand that. He had walked in. Just as I thought, "I found him", he was stuck in the wet concrete, unable to move. He was still and kept staring at me. And he was barking at me. Where was it again? I thought it was around here. Here it is. These are Tonbo's paw prints. His paws were really small. Without realizing it, Tonbo left his trace there. Because of that trace... I imagine at one point, the people who walk through here, have also had to endure patiently without going anywhere. You also have your own footprints here. Huh? Let's search for them someday. Beyond that mountain, people who have lost their memories and animals gather there. There are villages that live happily there. My name, how I lived... Even if I forget everything else... The moment I meet my loved ones again, we'll know each other. Chan Hae... Chan Hae! Yes. Who is that over there? Where? That person... aren't they look at me? Ah... a woman! That person was there earlier! They're looking at me! There's no one there. You don't see them? They're right there. There's a stranger in my house, I don't like it. Get them to leave! Yes... I'll get them to leave. "Saori threw everything away." "The things she learned from him." "The times she shared with him." "His advice and opinions." "And..." "Even her unfulfilled wishes." "Kousuke realized long ago that Saori's heart had left." "Kousuke..." "He knew that she couldn't gaze at only him in that way." "So, he stepped aside." ['Eternal Memories' by Matsumura Ryoko] Where are you going? You didn't say you were going out... To a good place. Why don't I go with you? I'm worried. I can't bring my lover to see my date, right? A date, huh? Sounds nice. I'm leaving. Wouldn't it be better to stay at home if you had a helper? I'll forget everyone. But... Only simple memories will remain. I'll be happy when someone is kind to me. It would be nice if that could continue for an eternity. ['Shining Forest'] [Long-Term Care Facility for the Elderly] Where did you go? You didn't think I'd be worried all day? Where did you go? Seriously... You're being bothersome. I met with Ayamine. You knew that. That's why I'm asking where did you go?! Don't you have something else to do other than following me around? From now on, find something else to do. Were you planning on being admitted to a sanatorium without letting me know? I didn't think you would be this sympathetic. Stop here. Let's... end it here. You must already know why, don't you? Am I not good enough? Haven't we made it this far together? The only reason I needed you was to complete my book. I don't need you anymore, so leave. I want to rest already. Am I an obstacle to you? I don't want to bother you anymore! You always say the same thing. "I don't want to bother you anymore." Do you even know what the most bothersome thing is?! I've had enough. I didn't want you to see how my illness worsens. This... Take it. This is my gratitude towards you for the work you've done until now. You really have insulted me until the end. Ryoko said she wants to see you. Can't you go see her? It seems like she wants to clear up a misunderstanding. There's no misunderstanding. She said you can blame her. We have different ways of thinking. It can't be helped. Ryoko... She wanted me to hand this to you. She said even if you don't accept anything else, you should at least accept this. Ryoko. "I..." "'Why do I want to write?' I kept asking myself." "There's a woman I want to understand, so I'm writing this sentence." "Her choice is selfish." "Her neglected emotions dominated me." "That's right." "I was used." [2 years later] Ha! You surprised me... Long time no see. Have you been well? You... Should I call you "So Chan Hae-sensei" now? Of course! Anna, you haven't changed at all. Chan Hae, your pronunciation is a bit strange. Say "not at all" one more time. (T/N: He's saying "not at all" (zenzen) as "jenjen") "Not at all". (T/N: He's saying "not at all" (zenzen) as "jenjen") Congratulations. So Chan Hae-sensei. It isn't a great book, but thanks for giving me the chance to publish it in Japan. It's completely okay. (T/N: She's imitating the way he says "jenjen") Chan Hae. ['Eternal Memories' by Ayamine Ryoko] In the end, the name "Ayamine Ryoko" was used. Have you read it? I didn't feel like looking for it to read. If you haven't read it yet... I can give it to you. ["Ke"] ["Ke"] Oh, Anna. Um, I was reading Ryoko-san's book... There's something strange about it... No... I don't think the editor made any mistakes, but can you check? They were waiting for Ryoko-sensei to change "ke" in the manuscript. Later, when they asked her to change "ke" to "ka", it seems like she asked them to absolutely not change any of it. [Traces of Tonbo] [Footprints] Without realizing it, Tonbo left his trace there. You also have your own footprints here. Let's search for them someday. [Coincidence Library] Hello! Hello. Do you live here? I don't. This is 'Coincidence Library'. A library? See? It's a library that you can enjoy by coincidence. [Coincidence Library] - A coincidence? - Yes, a coincidence. I guess meeting you was also a coincidence. I also like coincidences. Even if it's a coincidence, there must be something in that to make it fate. Did you sleep well? Are you okay? You are Matsumura Ryoko. I am... So Chan Hae. Do you remember? You remember, right? Beyond that mountain, people who have lost their memories and animals gather there. There are villages that live happily there. My name, how I lived... Even if I forget everything else... The moment I meet my loved ones again, we'll know each other. Chan Hae. Even if I lose my memories... We'll remember. I'm sorry... for being late...
