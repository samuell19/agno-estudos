-Just a reminder, don't panic. The contractors are coming next month, The electrical's all been hooked up, All it needs now is a little paint. -A lot of paint. Fine, a lot of paint. But we'll get there soon enough And before you know it you won't be able To imagine living anywhere else. Let's go check out the yard. Huh? - Yeah. - Okay, buddy. -It's way bigger than it looks in the pictures. -And way uglier. -Well guys, this is going to be great. I mean, look at the bones. Good bones. -Alisa, you do realize good bones is what everyone says When they've bought some money pit in the middle of nowhere. -We're only 45 minutes from the city, maya. Your friends can come visit anytime, stay overnight... -Oh sure, dad. My friends will definitely come visit us In our mildewed escape room. -Hey. Maya. Come back and help unload. -It's okay. It's fine. -We can play soccer out back. Huh, dad? When you're back from your trips. -Sure thing, bug. -And I can play with you too, theo, when your dad's away. I've got a wicked left foot. -My mom was a forward in college. She almost made nationals. -You'd tell me not to take it personally. -It's harder when you can't put it down To standard teenage angst. excuse us. - Oh... - coming through. oh. Oh, wow. She wasn't keeping up with the maintenance, was she? -A house like this is a lot of work For an old woman living alone. -Yeah, living alone and dying alone. -The agent said she died peacefully in bed. You're not suddenly bothered by that, are you? -Oh, no. God, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, I always dreamed of a house like this. Noise, lots of laughter, kids running down the hallway. It was, you know, only ever just me and grandmother. I always pictured a big house and a big messy family. -Well, you sure got the messy part When you ended up with a widower with two kids. Risky swipe. -Well, you used a very sexy photo. And your kids were in the plus column. More family, more love. -It's an amazing woman that says let's have even more kids And move to the country on our second date. Well, I mean, we were standing next to An overflowing garbage bin. It seemed like a life change was in order. -I was gonna say we were on a romantic stroll under the stars. -Hmm, you'd had three glasses of wine. -I remember how stunning you looked. -Well, obviously you weren't that drunk. -Ooops, sorry. -Yeah, that's okay. Big messy family, right? You asked for it. -Weird. -She was mom's. Her name is pearl. Mom cut her hair. She was such a badass. -I don't have anything of hers. -That's why we'll always keep her things around us. Okay? She'll always be with us. Even in this crappy place. -And all the rest of these you can just put in the basement. -What are you doing with mom's stuff? You wanna stick her in the basement? -Maya, no. No, no. Of course not. I'm just trying to clear some space and get rid of some junk. -Junk. Right. What else would you like to clear out, hmm? How about me and theo? Maybe get some new kids? -What? Maya. No. Let's, um... Let's reset... -I heard you and dad talking about it. Oh, get a house this big And you just have to fill it with babies. -Hey, maya. Enough. Take it down a notch. -Grr! -Bloodwork is clear. Hormone levels are promising. okay. Some good news for once. -Try not to get discouraged. -People say that but why isn't it happening for us yet? -The fertility journey can be difficult But there's no medical reason That you can't have a healthy pregnancy. A geriatric pregnancy. I hate that phrase. -Me too. But how are you feeling? -Um... A little overwhelmed to be honest. -Well, the hormones that you're taking can be destabilizing. This whole process is a huge stressor So do everything you can to reduce that stress. Lots of rest, exercise. That's what it takes to stimulate egg growth. -One, two, three. Okay. Okay. Here you go, hon. -Thank you. -You're welcome. You're welcome. - Okay. - How'd it go? -Oh, you know. Ouch. But I have to learn how to do it without you, so... -Ah. You sure you're not overcompensating a little? -Sit. Drink coffee. Be silent. -I admit, the house is kind of cool. Unfortunately it comes with a step-monster included. -At least yours isn't, like, five years older than you. -True. She spends all day auditioning to be my new best friend. -That's my job. -Trust me, you don't have to worry. -Oh, god. It's only been a week and I already miss you so much. -Me too. Your room is unbelievable! Huge! Give me the tour. -Okay. There are some nice touches. I've already started on my collage wall. -Cool. -And I can finally lock my door. -Aw, lucky. -And check out this closet. It's huge! -It's the size of a new york studio apartment. Boo! God, theo. Such a sneak. -Dad said you had to get downstairs pronto To catch the bus for school. -Oh my god. You're taking a bus? -Shut up. I'll talk to you later. -Okay, bye. -Oh, don't be such a creeper. Come on. -Oh, oh. Um... Hi. I made a smoothie with that fruit you like. Uh... Acai. -Acai. -However you pronounce it, It's pretty nice that alisa made you a smoothie, isn't it? -Don't really have time to drink it. I have to catch the bus. -What you mean is thanks for thinking of me, alisa. -Okay, fine. Thanks. -Have a good day. Try to stay warm. -What's that supposed to mean? -Nothing, nothing. You just get cold in that outfit. -Oh, my god. Are you shaming me for showing my body? - No! - You are! -No, no. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm... No. -Nice. Very progressive. Very feminist. -Ooh! Oh, great. No, I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. - Can I help? - Un-huh, uh-huh. I'm so sorry. Okay, let's go theo. You're gonna be late. Bye, honey. Have a good day. -Bye theo. -Bye. -Shey! -Hey! So, how's the new life? -It's good, it's hectic. I'm out for a run. -In the countryside? Scary. -Oh, it's not that remote, shey. -When can I come out there so we can drown those anxieties In a bathtub full of negronis? -Well, uh, soon. But I'm sort of hoping mine will just be herbal tea. Oh, that's great! Fingers crossed. And listen, for you I will come out there and drink tea. I might have to spike mine though. -Of course you will. I think I heard something. -A sasquatch? No, not a sasquatch! Listen, um, I'm gonna run but I will talk to you soon About coming out for a visit in a couple days. Okay? -Okay. I'll be waiting. Love you, have a good run. -Thank you, hon. Love you too. Bye! -Congratulations! When are you due? - Just a couple more weeks. - Oh, not long to go... -Are we all set? Do you need anything...? cute town. -I know, right? Listen. I think we have to delay the contractors. The money just isn't there. No big purchases for a while. -Okay. I just saw a really nice crib though. -Oh, remember we have theo's old crib. -Of course, yeah. I... It's just that, that, that's... That's yours and rachel's. Is it weird that sometimes I'm just a bit jealous of her? -Jealous of a dead woman? -I know. I know, it's ridiculous. -Come on, hon. Hey. Rachel's always gonna be a part of our story But you're not some consolation prize. You know that, right? You know I love you. -It's just that if she hadn't gotten cancer... -What? -Then we never would've met and I hate that thought. -But she did. It was awful. But then you and I found each other. I got struck by lightning twice in one lifetime. How lucky am I? -Pretty lucky I'd say. You know, we should probably replace this mirror but... I kinda like it. I think it has history. Uh... This sink on the other hand has got to go. -Ouch! -What happened? -Oh, nothing, just burned my finger. -What do you think? -Very romantic. Are you okay? -Why don't you take a look at it? -Okay, don't mind if I do. Oh, I don't know. I think you're gonna make it. Thank you, so sweet. There is one good thing about this new school, actually. Ugh. Alisa and my dad are so gross. They can't keep their hands off each other. Alisa is obsessed with getting pregnant. -They're newlyweds. They gotta do the business. -It feels like we're her practice family. Oh, I made you a smoothie. Oh, borrow my sweater. All stepmom 101. -Okay. What's the one good thing about the new school? -There's this boy. He's kind of different. -Different how? -I don't know, he's a little moody. Kind of dark, smart though. I like him. -Okay. Tell me more. -Chloe, I'll call you back. How could you do that to her? What are you, some kind of psycho? -What? To who? -Maya, calm down. -I found pearl in the garbage, dad. She tried to throw her out. -No, no. I would never. -Maya, alisa wouldn't do that. -Then who did? Who else would throw her in the garbage 'cause they really didn't give a... -Maya! -I would never take something precious to you And throw it away, maya. Maybe theo did it by mistake? I mean, I read about this. -Why would he throw out his mom's most important possession? -Well, sometimes kids act in ways That don't always make sense. -What do you know about kids? -What's... What's going on? -Theo, um... Did, did you throw maya's doll... -Mom's doll. -Theo honey, did you, by mistake, Throw the doll in the trash? -Her name is pearl. -Enough! Maya, you've made your point. -Alisa, no one's being accused of anything. -Aren't I? No, you're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -I don't understand. I didn't do anything. -It's okay, bug. Nobody's upset with- Oh, come on. Must be the breaker. -I'll go, I'll go flip the switch. -No, I got it. Come on, theo. Back to bed. Come on, you gotta use those young eyes of yours To guide us through the dark. You know I can see in the dark, right? -I know you can. I just hope you use your powers for good. -Wow. I am impressed. -Thank you. I told you I was good with my hands. -That I already knew. Cheaper than a contractor, right? -Definitely better looking. I still need to put on the handles. -I wish I could help but I gotta close this deal in cleveland. I will be back soon. -No, it's fine. It's okay. I'll just keep going, I'm on a roll. Where did you put the, um, new hardware? - It's in the basement. - Okay. -Watch the door, by the way. It sticks. -Okay. And this suit. So... -Maybe we should sneak upstairs right now. -Go! Go! I gotta get this done and you are gonna be late. Love you. -I love you. -Boy, you weren't kidding when you said sticky. Of course, of course. Here we go. Theo? ahhhh!!!! Theo! Theo! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Are you okay? -I saw something and I ran. I fell. -Honey, what did you see? -I was coming downstairs to look for my baseball equipment. I don't know where anything is in this house! -You poor thing. I'm so sorry. Listen, um... Let's go upstairs. Okay? And get you cleaned up? I'm sorry you hurt yourself. We're just gonna get you all patched up. Okay? Alright. Let's go. Okay, so... You know what you're gonna do? You are gonna think of the rudest, The worst word you know. Okay? The one you would never, ever, ever, ever say out loud. Count to three and then say that word into this. -Really? -Yes, really. I promise, you won't feel a thing. Okay. One, two, three. -See? Done! Done! -What do we do with the towel? -We... We wash it in very, very hot water. Alright. Let me get you a band-aid. I think I saw one in the hall. Wait here? Okay. -I want a batman one. -Okay. Please let me have a batman band-aid. Yes. So... Most of our band-aids are very boring and beige. But... Ta-da! -You found it! I found it. I told you we would find it. Okay. My next question is... Do you want me to go get you some ice cream? - Sure. - Okay. be right back. Huh. Hey theo? It's so weird, I don't... I don't see the ice cream. Maybe maya knows where it is. In the meantime, just get yourself some cookies. -Okay. Maya? May I help you? -I'm here for maya. -Do you have a name? -Uh, yeah. Tell me yours first. I'm alisa. Maya's stepmother. -I'm ethan, maya's friend. How do you like it here? My mom told me someone died here. Doesn't keep you up at night? -No. She was old, it's nothing to gossip about. -One person's gossip is another person's tragedy. -Let's go, ethan. -Maya, where are you going? -Out. -Did you arrange a curfew with your dad? You can't just be going out 'till all hours. -Have a good night. -Nice to meet you, alisa. -Alisa? I can't find my cookies. -Um... Okay, yeah. Come, come, come. -Oh, hey. What do you think? One room down, only 10 more to go. Um... You... You look a little pale. -I think I'm sick. When's my dad coming home? -Oh, honey. Not for a couple days. What does he usually do when you're sick? -My mom used to make lemon ginger tea. -Okay, I can handle that. Okay. -I'll bring you the tea, -thanks. -Please let me have ginger. Um... no... Mom? no! -Maya? Maya! Maya! The door's locked. Maya! Open the door, please! maya! no! no! -Maya? Maya? Maya. Honey. Maya? Are you okay? -What happened? -I think you had some sort of, um... A fever dream. You were thrashing around and you... You broke the teapot. -I thought I saw my mom, but... -Oh, honey. -I don't know why. It's all mixed up. -I think with the, um, cough medicine And the fever you just... It was too much. Honey, where you going? -I'm gonna sleep in theo's room tonight. -Are you sure? -Yeah. I always used to sleep on the floor next to his bed When my mom was sick. - Okay. -Okay, theo. Five minutes and we gotta go. Okay? Are... Are you going to school today? -Of course. I'm a responsible citizen. -Well, I... I didn't make you breakfast 'cause I just thought You'd still be feeling under the weather. I mean, especially after last night. Maya, you still look a little pale. I don't think your dad would mind If you took one more day to recover. -Well, I guess he doesn't get a vote 'cause he's never here. -Oh wait, hey. Sorry. Listen, um... Is this yours? -Not mine. -Are you sure? I thought it might be a gift from ethan. -Ethan has better taste than to give me that thing. -If she doesn't want it, can I have it? -It's time to go. -Here you go, ma'am. Enjoy. -Your coffee. -What are you doing here? -Nice to see you too, maya's stepmom. Beautiful day, huh? I'm fine, thanks for asking. -Fair enough. How are you, ethan? -I'm good. -Why aren't you in school? -It's four o'clock. It's done for today. -Oh no. Oh no, I forgot to go get theo. Oh, oh, oh god. Oh... Oh, thank you! Thank you, thank you! I'm so glad your teacher was, like, really cool. Oh wait! I got your favorite ice cream. This is good news, yeah? Maya! -Ah. It's so loud. I'm gonna go upstairs. -Okay. Maya! Maya, come on! It's not funny. -Please! Make it stop. -Don't worry. I'm trying, I know! Maya! -Goodnight. See ya tomorrow. -Hey. -Oh. -How was your trip? -Closed with three clients so I'd say pretty damn good. I, uh... Have to go back tomorrow though. -Already? -Yeah. I just came back for the night. I missed you. -The weirdest thing happened. Theo and I came home and there was music Just blasting everywhere. -With a teenager in the house. Well, that's shocking. -No. Maya wasn't home. Nobody was home. -Sounds like a prank. He's sleepwalking again. Don't startle him. Hey sweetie. Wake up. You're sleepwalking. You need to wake up. -Daddy, I had a bad dream. -It's okay, you're safe. We're both here. Time to go back to bed now. -Let me take him. -Sure. -I'm the best! I'm the bestest! And he scores... -Six times unlucky. -Hey bestie. Sent up the bat signal. -Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming. -Oh, hon. I'm so sorry. But there's lots of time still. Try again next month. I mean, trying's the fun part. Right? -Well, that's what they tell me. Come. See my haunted house. -Um... Are you kidding? This place is so gorgeous already. -Oh... Thank you. But you know, with the contractors and everything, It's just been impossible. -What about hot hubby? Can't he just whip out his tools? -He is away on a business trip, He comes back tomorrow. -Huh. And the unfriendly offspring? -Well, theo is at a sleepover and maya is... God only knows where. -Perfect! We can trash talk all night long. I'll go get the glasses. -But you knew an old lady died here when you bought the place. -Shey, she was 42 years old. She wasn't some old lady! -Okay. So, a middle-aged, youthful woman died here. I mean, this house is, what? A hundred years old? I'm sure a lot of people have died here. -I mean, but... A suicide? That's not exactly peaceful. And there's a presence in this house. Things go missing And maya thought she saw a woman in her room. -Okay. So, here's the thing. We don't believe in ghosts because we are smart, Science forward, 21st century women. -I'm not saying ghosts. -But this house is old. Why shouldn't it be haunted? Who are you to disturb them? You know what? You're the intruder. -Yeah. You know who would've loved this? - Sixteen year old us. - Oh, yeah. oh my god! Do you remember that ancient ouija board That we brought home from the flea market? -Because you wanted to contact your dead cat. mr. Cuddles! -Oh, mr. Cuddles! I loved that cat. -Aww. Mr. Cuddles. Rip mr. Cuddles. -Rip mr. Cuddles. Okay, you know what? We have to make the most of this place Before the walls come out and the pot lights go in. Do you remember that other game? What was it? The other game, where we... The mirror? bloody mary! -Yes! Oh my god, we have to do it. Which bathroom? It's five minutes to midnight. This is perfect. We... We gotta go. We gotta do it. We're gonna bloody mary it up in the bathroom. Let's go! -I... -I'm going upstairs. -Wait, wait, wait. What? -Let's see if the lady of the house is here. Do you remember the rules? -Uh... No, not really. And what if she is here? -Then you have to make peace with her, lis. Do it. Okay? But you have to do it alone. -Why? -Because I might scare her and I also forgot the wine, So... Start without me. I'll be right back. Say hi! -Bloody mary, bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. Bloody mary. bloody mary. Shey. Shey. Shey, this isn't funny. Open the door. Shey, the door is locked! Let me out, it's not funny! Shey! Shey! -Bloody mary. -What's going on? Did it... Did it work? -Wow. Drunk much? -Err... We were just... -I really don't care what counts for a fun night with old people. -What the hell? Maya. We need to talk. Because your idea of a joke is actually really nasty. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, come on, maya. The website that you left open for me? I would never drink if I was pregnant. Making me feel guilty, why would you do something like that? -I could say the same thing. -What happened here? -You tell me. -You honestly think I would do something like that? - I'm back! - Where is everybody? -I'm gonna see ethan. -Hey my two girls. What's going on? -Ask her! -Hey wait, maya. -Just let her go. She's... Just so angry. -What the hell? This is rachel's. Who would do this? -Well, it's not something theo could do. I certainly didn't do it. Maybe maya herself? -Why in god's name Would she deface her own mother's doll, alisa? -I don't know. To drive a wedge between us Because she's not in a good place? She doesn't want to be here, chris. She doesn't want me to be here And I'm stuck dealing with it on my own. -Hey, hey. I know it's been hard. Alright? I get it. But it won't be like this for long, I promise. Hey. We're gonna make a good life here. -Rachel's doll isn't the only strange thing. There is something wrong with this house, chris. Remember when I told you about the music? Well, that wasn't the only thing. There have been other strange things. Missing objects and... And noises. -Lis, it's a creaky old house. -Yeah, but I have a really bad feeling. Like a... Like an odd sensation. -Lis, please. Okay? I... I just got back. Please, okay? Give me a minute. I'll go pick up theo. -I was gonna... -I'll do it. -Alisa, are you still in there? -Yes. -New day. Can we get a do over? -I may be open to it. -Made you coffee. -Smart man. -Do you want me to do that? -Oh, no. I'm an expert now. Check it out. Huh. -Oh, chris. This is the month. The month that everything gets better. We're going to get pregnant. I can feel it. We're down three water bottles already and it's only October. -Theo? Can you look in the lunchroom for your water bottle? Please, kiddo? Hi maya. Bye maya. Huh. So I'm guessing that's the new boyfriend. -Yeah. Straight out of central casting. Bad boy in a bad car. -Oh! Hey, stepmom. Chill. -What in the hell are you doing down here?! How did you even get in here?! Maya... These aren't play clothes. -Are you spying on me? Oh my god, you're worse than theo. -You know what maya? I can't fight with you today. But if I were you, I would take off those clothes And get in the shower. They've been in there for god only knows how long. -And he needs to go, now! -I told you, she's crazy. -Listen to me. What I'm talking about is the opposite of dead. Something feels... Alive. Okay? I... I can't explain it. And I know I'm not making any sense. -Lis, I gotta ask. Are you getting any sleep? -You know I haven't. -You're worn out. You're suddenly a mom. All those hormones you're taking. You're under a lot of pressure. -There's something going on here, shey. And it's really starting to mess with me. -A therapist could be helpful. -It's not me! It's this bloody house! -Okay, okay. I'm sorry. -You know what? I just... Never mind, I gotta go. Bye. -Wait! -I'm done. Please just stop! Just leave us alone! This is all of our stuff. Theo, honey? Are you alright? -I think I had another bad dream. -Oh. It's okay, you're okay. I'm here. Okay? Come on, let's go back to bed. -Okay. Another test. Here we go. Please be positive. alisa, where is theo's lunch? -Coming! -Theo? Got your lunchbox. -Thanks. -Have a good day. I... Okay, um... Ugh. You gotta be kidding me? Great. things are disappearing from the house And I found theo's missing water bottles in the woods. Chris, you are not listening to me. -I am. You were in the woods. You found a bunch of garbage the kids hid. -Yes, and they both denied it. Weren't you just telling me Theo's lost several water bottles already this year? Come on, babe. Remember when you were that age? It's just deny, deny, deny. Whoa, whoops! I got caught. -It's not just about the garbage or the water bottles. It's about the footprint right beside it. A big footprint! -You're telling me you saw a person. -No. I, I... It was a presence. Okay? It's the best way I can describe it. Chris, you don't know what it's like To be in this house alone day after day. -You're not alone in the house though. The kids are here. Maybe that's part of this, alisa, you know? All this change would affect anyone emotionally. -You think I'm losing it? -I just want you to be healthy. We're trying to have a baby. You know? What? -I just think that if you came out into the woods and saw... -It is almost midnight, lis. No! -Alright. Come. It was... It was right... It was right here. It was... It was here. I know it was here. I... I think... I think it was here. Everything's been moved. -And the footprints? -Erased with the branch. -Please, no more alisa. Okay? It's not the house, it's not the kids. -So it's me then?! I'm, I'm the one that's just ruining everything! -That's not fair. Hey. That's not true. -Then take me away from here. Please. Let's just put the house on the market. -Selling now is the kinda move that puts people In bankruptcy court, alisa. -I don't care! Please! Just take me away from here! -Okay. Just... Just come here. Come here. You're exhausted. Maybe we can get you something to calm down, to relax. There's a guy in town. A psychiatrist. I hear he's highly recommended. -Pills? That's your solution? -If it helps you calm your nerves, yeah. I love you so much. I don't like seeing you this way. -So, um... When are you coming home again? -Tomorrow hopefully. It's my last trip and then I'm home for good. -I can't wait. -Maya, what... My god. -Eww. Gross. -It wasn't there before dinner. Theo, did you...? -No! I would never! -What's going on in this place? -Wait, what do you mean? -I've been hearing strange noises at night And my things keep disappearing. Something is wrong in this house. -Maya, why didn't you say anything? -I don't know, I should have. But I was... Listening when dad was saying you were imagining things The other day. I didn't stick up for you and I should have. I know you didn't do anything to mom's doll. -I would never do that to something that mattered to you. Someone's been in this house. -Who? -I don't know. Do you think ethan would do something like this? -No! Why would he... He wouldn't do that. -Well. Okay. Someone's clearly been messing with us. We have to get out. Your dad's coming back tomorrow and I'll tell him It is not up for debate anymore. -What about tonight? -You guys are sleeping with me. Enough. Jeez. -Just get inside. -Just get inside. Just get inside. -Okay. Okay. -This isn't how I wanted us to meet. God, this isn't how this... This isn't how I wanted us to meet. Just... It's gone wrong, completely wrong. I've seen you. I've heard you. I've been listening to you. Watching. Watching over you. Maya! -Shh! Why are you doing that, please. -Maya! Maya! -She is part of the problem. -Maya! Maya, can you hear me? Maya, get out of the house! -Please stop. Stop, stop. I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this. I... I don't wanna hurt you. I just wanna talk. -I know how hard it's been. It's been hard for you here. You have to, you know, do those shots and take those pills. My mom took pills too. Lots of pills. So many pills. You know, drinking's bad. It hides your sadness. You know, and, and... And chris. I mean, he's never around to see you sad. He doesn't listen to you, he doesn't believe you. He doesn't know you like I do. So, so... I could help. -I could help this time. You don't gotta be sad anymore. -If I take that off, you promise not to scream, right? Was it your mom who died here in this house? I know what it's like. To lose your mother. My mother died too. -I know. I know everything about you. We're the same. The others will go, they'll leave. Chris and theo. I'll make it so they wanna leave. But the girl... She's so mean. She's so cruel to you. You don't deserve it. No more mean girl. I'll get rid of her. -Maya! Run! -Alisa? Alisa? -I'll get rid of her. I have to get rid of her. They all have to go. I'll... I'll make them all go. Yeah. I'll make them, I'll make them all go. -Alisa? -As if she cares about anybody but herself. -Alisa? -She broke my chain. My mother gave me that chain. My mom gave me that chain and she broke it. -Where's my phone? Where's my phone? Come with me and be quiet. Come on. - What's going on? - Shh. -Does that thing even work? -I don't know.
