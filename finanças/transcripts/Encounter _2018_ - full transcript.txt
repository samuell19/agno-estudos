- Use lethal force if necessary. - Move in! - On the floor! - It's mine! - He's got a gun! - It chose me! - Drop your weapon, sir! - I won't let you take it! - We've got the pod. - It is another balmy Georgia night with temperatures in the low 80s. Hopefully you're increasing the heat personally here Augusta with someone special. Hey, if you're by yourself, Bo Christine here sending this one out to you on 95 Rock. - She left me. - Does that really surprise you? - No, I guess not. - Which girl are we talking about here? Rachel or the new girl from Reinhardts? - Rachel. Because of that new girl from Reinhardts. - Amen to that, brother. Rachel never liked me anyway, so... Good riddance. - Aw, that's not true. She liked you a lot, bro. - Please, please! She was always bothered by me. - Everyone's bothered by you, Marcus. We just tolerate you. Did you know that? - Well, I know now. I mean, at least I get a free beer out of it. But you know what, you gotta stop being so damn cheap and get us some real beer instead of this piss-water. - I'm on a budget. - What's it like having your wife wear the pants of the family? - I don't see you workin' neither. - I'm self-employed! - Just another word for unemployed. - Shit. - What are you laughing at? Last decent job you had was cracking the skulls of horny lowlifes at Crazy Eight's. Will and I had a good laugh about that one. - Speaking of which, you have any thoughts or plans on what you gonna do with 'em? - We already had this conversation. We're not having it again. - I'm just concerned, that's all. - I know you're concerned. You've made that very clear, over and over again. - Look, all I'm saying is the current situation might be making it worse. Mopin' and paintin' all day. Maybe he might benefit from going to see a therapist. - There you go again, Marcus! We're done talking about it, okay? - Terry! Teresa! - Hey, what's up? - I just... - Oh. - Yeah, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - I just dropped the bottle. - Yeah you did. You're burning the midnight oil tonight. - Did I wake you? - Uh, no, I just got home from work about a half hour ago. - Late shift, huh? - Tonight was my last night. Her regular caregiver is back from vacation tomorrow morning so I have a bit of a break before I go back to my regular shift. - I'm sure the overtime doesn't hurt either, right? - No, thank God for that. Hey, get out! - Look, I'm sorry to bother you anyway. - It's totally fine. I was reading, it's not a big deal. Besides, I can't really sleep until Brent gets home. Especially when he's out with the boys. - Yeah. He's been doing that a lot lately. - Yeah, he's got a lot on his mind. - Hey, you got a picture of this new girl? I don't think I know her. - Course you do. It's the redhead from last Tuesday night. - Man, that's too steep. - I'll show you a picture, trust me, you'll remember her. Timeline, hold on a sec. Signal's for shit out here. I got zero service. - Your cellphone carrier's just like Brent's beer. Cheap. - Hey! - Good Lord! - What the hell? - Was that a plane? - That's too small for a plane. Let's go, let's go! - Hey, cooler, cooler! - I told you it wasn't a plane. - Either of you getting any service? We should call the police, shouldn't we? - Don't worry about it. - What the hell is it? - Can you feel that heat? - Oh yeah. - Grab the cooler. We'll ice it down. You better stand back. - No problem. - On three. One, two, three. - What the hell was that? - Is it a satellite? - Since we're both awake, do you want a rematch? So you can win back those Oreos you so poorly, embarrassingly lost to me? That was pathetic. - No, I'm just gonna stay up. I'm gonna finish this I think. - What are you working on? - I thought it'd be nice to paint her younger, you know? Thought Jess would like that. Maybe I could give it to her in person, you know? - Do you know what Jess would really like, well, is-- - What, Terry, what? - What would she like? - Over there. - Is everything okay? - Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Hey, hey, hey, stop! What are you guys doing? - We need a table, bro, we need a table. - Yo, yo, yo, come on! - What is going on? You guys are scaring me. - You might want to grab your inhaler. - Why do I need my inhaler? - We brought you back a little something. - This had better be good. - We might have another-- - Ow! What? - I said we might have another one. - What, this soon? Tell me you're joking. - When have you ever known me to have a sense of humor? - Where? - Augusta, Georgia. Atlanta has already sent a team to lock down the site and set up a field office. - All right. Give me a half hour. - So wait, you didn't call the police? - We couldn't get a signal. - No one's calling the police. - Okay, but what if it's a-- - What if it's what? A satellite, a piece of a rocket, a piece of the International Space Station? It's definitely none of those things, I can tell you that. - How do you know? - I watch the Discovery Channel, Terry! - Religiously. - We should still try and figure it out, I mean, there's a chance it could be dangerous, right? - Will could be right. What if there's some kind of disease on there, radiation or something? - Well if that's the case, we're already screwed. - We're already screwed? - I didn't wash my hands. Did you guys wash your hands after you touched it, or... - No, I didn't... - John, he's messing with you, just relax. - You're a douchebag. - You know, we did find it though, so there's gotta be something to that. - You mean like money? - Maybe. So before we do anything stupid, like calling the cops, we need to figure this all out. Are we agreed? - Yeah, sure. - John? - Yeah, yeah, I guess. - So what do we do? - You know, maybe we should all get some sleep. You guys want to go home, or you want to crash here? - I'd rather stay. You know, protect our investment. - It's a good point, me too, I guess. - Okay, well, Terry will set you up in the living room. - Are you guys serious? How are you gonna be able to sleep? I mean there's a whatever-this-is sitting right here. - I guess you've got first watch, then. - Okay. - No, it's cool, bro, I'll take first watch. - No, it's cool, I got it. - No, seriously, I got it. Matter of fact, why don't you take the couch? - I already said I wasn't tired. - I said it's cool. - It's not cool, okay? Why don't you tell us what you really think? - Marcus... - No, no, no. - Will can take it. Ain't you, Will? - Yeah. - Okay, let's see, um... Maybe it's the fact that you live in your sister's garage, painting pictures all damn day. You see, this the shit I've been talking about, man. When was the last time this dude had a decent rest? - Wish I could get up out of this chair and punch you in the mouth. - You know, brother, hand in my heart, I would love to see that. - Okay, it's settled! Will gets first watch. - Yeah, it's fine. - Goodnight, Will. - Goodnight, John. - Healing takes time, Will. Lights on or off? - Off. Oh shit. God damn. Oh shit! No, no, no! - I can't stay Will! Let me go! - Please don't leave me! - Will, I can't! - Help me! - Will! - Get him out of here! - What are you doing, what are you doing? You have to take me back in there now! - Do you think we should take him to a doctor? - And say what, he was attacked by an alien? - It didn't attack me! - Well that's not what it looked like to me. - It didn't attack me, you have to listen! - Look, that's what I call an attack! - Listen to me! - Hey guys, come on fellas! - Break it up! - Chill out! - Listen to me, I can feel my legs! - Will, Will, let me go! - Terry might be right. Ain't no telling what that thing could have done to him in there. - It didn't do anything to me, all right? Were you guys not in that room, did you not see what just happened? Huh? Brent, I can feel my legs. I can feel it, okay? I can stand. Take me back in there, please. - No. - Just take me back in for one more moment please. - No. - I'm fine, okay. - Until a baby alien pops out the back of your neck and tries to eat us! - Marcus, anyone ever tell you that you stick your nose into a lot of places it don't belong? - Many of times. But this doesn't change the fact that that thing could be in there doing some body snatching shit on you. - Oh come on. - I mean, how do we know that Will is even real? He could be pretending to be Will so he can take us over. - You're not seriously listening to this bullshit, are you? - That's probably what an alien would say! - That's exactly what an alien would say! - No one asked you John! - Will you all calm down? - Hey man, I'm just saying-- - I said shut the hell up! I can't think! - Marcus, if I am an alien, I'm gonna eat you first. - You hear that? - John, John. - What? - Is there someone from Payne College we can talk to? - What, what do you mean? - Like one of your teachers? - Dude, I'm taking auto shop classes. What the hell would those guys know about any of this? - Yeah, but there's gotta be other teachers. They teach a lot of science stuff there, yeah? - Yeah, I dunno, yeah, I guess! - Think, there's gotta be someone! - I thought you said you didn't want to tell anybody about any of this until we got this all figured out! - Well, the situation's kind of changed, hasn't it? - Hey, hey, didn't you take some astrology class a few years ago when you was trying to be an astronaut or some stupid shit like that? - No, it was an astronomy class. I never said I wanted to be an astronaut. - Yeah, right! - Look, if it's anyone, it's my old biology teacher we should be talking to. - Okay, whatever, what's his name? - Um... - It was only a few years ago, John! - I know, I know, hold on! - Well what's his name, dumbass? - Jesus Christ, give me a second to think! - Hey hey hey! Chill out with the blasphemy, bro. - Westlake. - What? - Westlake, it was Professor Westlake. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, but who knows if he's still there or not? - Yeah, he is. Do you need his cell phone, email address? - Text it to me. Let's go. - Wait, no, now? No, I don't think that's such a good idea, Brent. - And why not? - For one, he failed me. - And for two, what are we gonna do here? No offense, but I don't particularly feel safe being alone with um, him. - Okay. You're going back to the field. - And why would I do that? - To see if we missed anything. - That's a good idea. - Go, go. - I'm staying with Will. - Are you okay with that? - Yeah. - I promise I won't eat her. - Yeah, right. - I'll be fine, okay, I'll be fine. - A gun, really? - Just stay out of the garage for now. - I hope that's not for me. - You would do the same. - No I wouldn't. - I won't be long. And you... Stay out of the garage. - Next time I got first watch. This dude's taking about eating people-- - Shut up Marcus! - Shut up! - Hello, Professor Westlake? - Come in, in here. Did we have an appointment? - There wasn't any time. - Now... What can I do for you? - We need to talk to you about a private matter. - Are you students of mine? - He used to be your student. - Yeah, it was a few years ago. I wasn't here very much. - Well, what do you want, then? What private matter? Oh, I do remember you. Brandt. Johnathan Brandt, right? - Unfortunately, yeah. - You know, I only failed you because you were constantly absent. You actually showed some promise. - I just don't think I was cut out for biology. - I assume you went on to grander things, then? - Well... - So. Why are we here? - We're here because we found something. We found it in a field not far from here. Something otherworldly. - Huh. - I thought you guys were all done by now. - Done? - Aren't you with those government folk who were messin' my property? - Well, I was actually coming to ask permission to look at your field, the one back there. So government people came to look at your field? - Out here this morning with their damn trucks making a whole racket. Digging up the place and testing the soil. Only left about an hour ago. Thought you were one of them back to annoy me or to dig up my field again. - Can we just go look at your field, please? - I coulda sworn it was right here. - You know those things will kill you. - Yup. - Big boy's awful interested in that field, isn't he? - Could be a farmhand. - My gut says go with the peanut farmer. - My gut says... Save me some of those fries. - That's a pretty wild story. - Well, that's the way it all happened. - I would need to see it. - We figured that. Could you come with us now? - No, that's impossible. I have classes until this evening. - Well, tonight then? - I... - Please. - All right then, all right. - My address and cell. Okay. - You wouldn't be making fun of an old man, now would you? - Text before you come. - Are you sure you don't want something to eat? - No thank you. - You really should eat something. - Can you just get my wheelchair please? - Brent said that we should stay out of the garage. - Always do everything he tells you to do? I'm sorry, I just... I want my chair, I don't want to be on the couch anymore, okay? - I am sure that he will be back soon. - It's not gonna hurt you Terry, okay? Just let me go back in there for a second. - I really don't think that that's a good idea, Will. - Why? Why? Just let me go back in there. Let me just see it for a second. It's probably frightened. - Will. Please don't make this difficult. - I'm not making it difficult-- - You are making it difficult. - Then just go in there and get the chair. It'll take five seconds. Why don't you understand-- - I just don't want to do the wrong thing. God damn it! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Terry. - It's okay. - Hey, do you think I could get some fresh clothes? I've been wearing these for days and I'm all sweaty, I'm starting to stink. It's just driving me crazy. - Okay, you want me to draw you a bath? - Yeah, you know what, that sounds great. - Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna need your help with the... - Yeah, of course. - Hey, what's up sweetie? - Hey Terry. Look, I'm sorry to bug you again about this, but I got another notice. - Oh, the bill for the physical therapy. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I spaced on that. I promise I'll take care of that right away. - Honey, are you okay? You don't sound like yourself. You want to go grab a coffee? I could probably break from this place in about an hour. - It's not a good day, really. I can't leave the house. Can you hang on a sec? - Yeah, of course. - Is everything all right? - Terry? - Will? No, I gotta go! Will, Will! No, Will! Will, open the door! Will, open the door! Will, please open this door! Open the door please! Will, please open the door! Please open this door! - So you're telling me you've never seen this man before? Ever? You have no idea who he is, you have no idea why he came out to your farm? You have no idea why he was asking you questions? - I told you, I don't know who he was or why he was there! - Mr. Cobb, you actually expect me to believe that you didn't find it odd that a perfect stranger... - If it comes to it, I've got authorization for a full tactical strike, I'm talking ashes on the ground. - I understand. Just keep me posted. - To tell you the truth, I find it more odd that that hole wasn't there anymore. Maybe it's you who should tell me what the hell is going on! What was that? - Would you excuse me for a second? I'll be right back. What? - This guy knows crap. - Well, obviously. - Then why are you wasting time? - What got up your ass? - Just heard from the guys in the lab. Things are getting pretty weird with our new friend from Briar's Bluff. Like shit-your-pants weird. - What does that even mean? - Means we need to contain this. We are gonna need more firepower than a SWAT team to save our asses this time. - You all right? All right. What do we got on the mystery gang? - We have an address. - We got a lot more than that. - It always creeps me out when you smile like that. - Should. - Hey. Hey, it's okay. I'm sorry. It's all right. Okay, it's all right. It's okay. This is not your fault, okay? I know you're scared, but you don't have to be, okay? You don't have to be afraid anymore. It's not gonna hurt you. Not gonna hurt you. I promise, Terry. I promise it won't hurt you. - Okay. - You're such a disappointment! - You see what you make me do, see? - Terry? Terry, where are you? Terry? What the hell is going on? What did you do? - Brent, it's okay. - It's not okay! - It's okay! - I told you to stay out of here. - You don't need to worry about anything-- - That thing was touching you! - Yeah. - What did it do to you? - Relax. - What did it do to you? - It didn't do anything. - What did you do to my wife? - Nothing. - What did you do to my wife? - Stop! - Brent? - Make it stop, make it stop! - Stop. - Did you not hear that? - Hear what? - You hear that, right? What the hell is going on? - Am I the only one scared shitless right now? - Where's my gun? - You don't need your gun. - I'll decide. - No, I will. You don't need it, Will was right. It's not trying to hurt us. It didn't try to hurt me, it's not-- - Well, it certainly tried to hurt me, Terry. - That's because it thought that you were gonna punch Will. - I wasn't gonna try and punch him! - No, I know, but it thought that you were, that's all! - Oh shit, she's one of them now, isn't she? - Shut up John, you're not helping! - Guys! - Dammit, I just can't get used to you walking around again. It's-- - I know. - It's amazing. - Mr. Doyle, FBI, we'd like to have a word with you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll, Geronimo. Easier way to do things. - Listen, what happened with the professor? - He's coming over later. - Okay, good. How did he take the news? - How do you think he took it? I thought the man was gonna have a stroke. - Should we be worried he might tell someone? - He won't. - You guys ain't gonna never-- Holy mother of God! What the hell? Please tell me you guys are still you guys. - I am. - Where have you been? - I think we got a problem. - Mr. Doyle, FBI, we're armed so please announce yourself! - He's not home. - We need the kit. - Whoa whoa, easy killer. - I'll get the kit. You take a Valium. Good Lord. - How do you know you weren't followed? - I just act like I was in a movie and made myself hard to find. - Yeah, that must've been easy. - You might wanna take that up with God if you have a problem with the way that I look. - You might want to rethink that. - Do we really gotta be in here with that thing? I mean, why can't we just go and talk in the living room? - Because unfortunately I'm not wireless. - I mean, doesn't that shit creep y'all out? Look man, I'm still not convinced that that thing is the beginning of some kind of invasion. - It's not. - Oh, and you know? - I know because it showed me. - What did it show you? - Things about itself. About where it comes from. - You see that? This the shit I'm talkin' about. - Please, Marcus! Do you know what he's talking about? Did it show you that stuff too, or... - I'm not sure. - What does that mean? - I saw flashes of something when it touched me, but it was so fast I couldn't make sense of it. Like a dream that you can't remember in the morning. - I still see it. You guys, you gotta see it. Just let it touch you. - Hell nah! Man, I ain't going near that thing. Right? - Did it hurt? - No. It actually made me feel better. - Better? - Yeah, like I could breathe easier. - Well, then why were you shaking on the floor when it touched you? I mean, you were flailing around in pain, I saw it, you were in pain! - No, it was trying to figure me out. My injury confused it. - I don't get it. The doctor said you'd never walk again-- - I don't have the answers, okay? Trust me when I say that you'll understand when you bond with it. - Nope. No thank you. I don't trust that thing. - Isn't this what they teach you in church? Blind faith? - Look here, bro. Don't talk about miracles to me, 'cause this ain't even in the same ball park. - Why can't this be a miracle, huh? Why can't this be God? - You better talk to your brother, man. I don't appreciate him questioning my faith. You know, next time we might have to test your little miracle theory and see if you can talk with a broken jaw, how about that? - Relax, Marcus. That's not what he's trying to do. That's not what you're trying to do, right? - I'm outta here. - And where are you going? - I'm going to feed my cat! - Just let him go. - Are you coming back? - Obviously! Since I'm the only sane one amongst us. - Hmm. Well, if he's got it, it's sure as shit not here. Nothin'. - Okay. Westlake's coming over around 5:00 pm. - Great. You hungry, want to eat something? - Maybe something small. - I'm starving, thanks Terry. - Yeah. - Will? - I'm fine. - Hey, I'm starting to smell like that thing. Do you mind if I borrow a fresh T-shirt? - Sure. - Thanks. - You know... I really hope you know what you're doing. - Let me show you. - No, no. - Please. - Will... No. Get some sleep. - I'm-- - I'm not tired. - What's that? - Maybe this guy knows where we could find Mr. Doyle? Let's track him down. - Sure, sure. One of us should probably stay here though in case Mr. Doyle comes back. In this really nicely air-conditioned not-stupidly-hot apartment. - We should flip for it. - Okay. I take heads. - You always get heads. - I do. - FBI. - What the hell? - Mr. Doyle, this is Agent Tevis, I'm Agent Banks. Mr. Doyle, we'd just like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. - What the hell? - There's one here that I wanted to show you. Here. I used to love going here. It's been a long time since I've been. - It's such a perfect day. It's such a perfect day. - It's too much. It's too much. Professor, nice to meet you. - Whoa... - Ask him anything you want. I think you guys have a lot to talk about. - Oh my... You found this in a field? - Yeah, they did. - It's grown since we found it. - Have you ever seen anything like it before? - Could I get a drink of water? - Yeah. - What do you think that it wants? - Give the man a second. - It's okay, it's not gonna hurt you, so don't be afraid. - Thank you, thank you. It's just marvelous. Simply marvelous. I'd like to examine it. I'd like to examine you all. - You played for Georgia Southern, huh? I know you did, I saw you play. Division one AA national champions. Four out of six years, '85 through '90. And that was some of you, my friend. Boom! - Don't strike me as an Eagles fan. - Oh, hell no. Georgia State all the way. Go Panthers! Woo-hoo! No, seriously, you were good, man. This dude right here, one of the best tied ends in the conference. Mmm! - Why didn't you go pro? - Yeah, why didn't you go pro? Oh... That's right, the injury. - What a shame. All that raw talent gone to waste. - From all-American to peanut farmer like that, huh? - Mr. Doyle, why don't you have a seat and tell us what you were doing at Roger Cobb's farm this morning? - I'd rather stand. - No, you're gonna sit down. - So that's not causing you any abnormal sensations or discomfort? - No. - Even in your legs? - It's like I was never paralyzed. - Huh. Physiologically, this is quite impossible. You do know that? - Of course I know that. Always hated needles. - Yeah, me too. Now... What do we do about you? I'm not ready for that yet. - I think it would feel reassured if it could touch you. - Why do you think that? - It's just a feeling, I guess. - Did it tell you to let it touch me? - It's more like a suggestion. It's hard to explain. - I'd like you to try. Okay, well, it's like... - He says it shows him things. Right, Will? That's what you said. - Is that true? - It shows me things, yes. - Shows you what? - It's kinda like memories. - Your memories, or its memories? - Both. It's confusing most of the time. Some things are clearer than others. Professor, you'd understand if you just let it bond with you. - I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't scared. - I was scared too, but I actually felt better after. - That's not exactly reassuring. You see, the rational side of me says it's pumping you full of endorphins or who-knows-what. It could be giving you the illusion of euphoria... - There's really nothing we can say that's gonna convince you, is there? - There's nothing you can say that I can't explain away with science. - How can science explain me walking? - Almost nothing, yes, I... - You have to ask yourself, Professor. When faced with the unknown, do you step away from the void? Or do you dive in? - I've already faced the void. Pancreatic, stage four. - I'm sorry. - I've had a good life, I just... I wish it could've been a little longer. - Maybe... - What the hell was that? - Did you see it? Tell me you saw it! - I saw it, I saw it! - What? - I saw it. - Will! - Will, come on! - Get out of there! - Come on! - It's getting larger. - It's marvelous. Just marvelous! - Look, I already answered all your questions. Only thing you're doing is repeating yourself, so I think you're done here. - Oh, I don't think we're done. Tell me Marcus, have you found any unusual bruises on your body? - No, but you about to. - Easy, Mr. Doyle. - Look, I just want y'all to leave. - All right. - Oh, but there's so much more to say, Mr. Doyle. - All right, look, let me just talk to my partner for a moment. - Think we should let him go. - I just rattled his cage. Come on, let's see where this thing leads. - Have you ever heard of the fourth amendment? - Screw the fourth amendment! - The pod is not here, we are wasting time! - Look, I am telling you my gut says go with this. - We're gonna give him some breathing room. - Do you really think that that's gonna help? - Yes, yes I do! - Fine. But for the record, I disagree. - Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Doyle. That's all we need for now. - Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. - So what do you think this thing is doing to Will? - I don't know yet. Haven't had a chance to run all the tests. - Ah, well, you must have some kind of opinion about it. - I'd like to think I'm a little more empirical than just giving you my hunches. - Can I tell you what I think? - Sure. - I think this thing is studying us. Like, I don't believe all that Invasion of the Body Snatchers crap that Marcus seems so concerned about. I think it's using Will to gather information. - For what purpose? You think it has nefarious intentions? - Actually... I hadn't thought that far ahead. - But that's an astute observation. You know, I might have to revisit that grade I gave you. - Well, I think it might be a little late for that, Professor. - There's one thing I've come to realize, son. Nothing is ever too late. - Yeah, well... School administration might think otherwise. - The hell do they know, anyway? - Good job loser, I think he saw you. - Calm down, he didn't see me. - Oh, he saw you. - Come on Brent, answer this, man. - You've reached Brent Fleming. Leave a message. - Brent, hey man... Call me as soon as you get this. I gotta figure out a way to get up outta here, so I think it's best that I leave the car parked at the restaurant. Come and get me, man, soon as you can, bro. Peace. - Shit! - What part of I told you so didn't you understand? - I got it. - Just keep an eye on his car in case he decides to make a run for it. - You're not going. - I am going, I am! - No, Brent, if he said that we're in danger then you're not going! - He didn't say danger, he said there's trouble! - What is the difference? - Oh, so you just want me to abandon Marcus? Is that what you want? - I am not saying no. Why doesn't Marcus just come here? - I told you, he doesn't think it's safe! He said they could be watching! - Okay, and how do you expect to not be seen by them? - I'm a lot smarter than you give me credit for. - That's not-- Brent, you're not going! Can you do something? - What am I supposed to do? - Talk to him! - Talk to him? - Thanks, thanks. - Talk to him. - I haven't seen any movement for a while. - He's gotta be in there. See, told ya. - Hold up, we got a car coming. - Maybe it's that friend of his? - Yeah, okay, run the plates. - On it. - I have a vehicle registered to a Jay Lou Park. 26 years old, 5'7, black hair, brown eyes, no priors. - Are you Marcus? - God! Sir, get out of the car. Get out of the car right now. - Banks, what the hell are you doing? - Don't shoot, don't shoot! Please don't shoot me! - Get on your knees! - Sorry, I thought you were the guy who called! - What? - He's a goddamn Uber driver! - Oh son of a bitch! - Here, have a nice day. - I'll just wait here. - Dammit! - Hey, come on, it was your bright idea to give him breathing room, remember, huh? You know what, let's just go find out where he went. That's all we gotta... - Huh, well that's encouraging. - What's that? - The good news is that none of you show any signs of unusual toxins in your bodies. No radiation damage. - Not even Will and Teresa? - Nothing. Completely normal. - Huh. Is there any bad news? - For you, there is. Your cholesterol is through the roof. You should probably get that checked out. - Can I help you with anything? And are you warm enough? - I don't suppose you have any weed? - Are you being serious? - Purely for medicinal purposes, I assure you. - Yeah, um, I'm more of a beer guy myself. Maybe Brent might have something. - Don't worry about it. - Are you afraid? - Are we all? - Marcus believes that we see all our loved ones after we die. - Then there's gonna be a lot of people waiting on me. - You believe that? - I've noticed you've taken a liking to my butterflies. Maybe that's what death is, a rebirth. Maybe we all become butterflies. - Butterflies? - Metaphorically speaking. You know, if you really want to help, there's a notebook out there on my desk. If you could grab that for me I'd appreciate it. - Okay. Professor? Professor? No! Hey. I just talked to Brent, he's getting Marcus. They're gonna get here as soon as they can. - Okay, that's good. John, it's gonna be okay. - I don't know what to do! - Just try to calm down. - Can you please come too? You know how those guys can be. - John, I don't think so. - Please, Terry! I really need you. - Hey, what's going on? - Yeah, you know what, okay. Yeah, John, we'll come right away. - What's that all about? - It's the professor. John had to take him to the hospital and we need to go right away. - We are? I'm not going. - What? - I'm not going. - Will, I'm not arguing with you. - Terry, I don't need to go and I don't want to go. - Will, are you coming? - I said no. - Forget it. - Hey, you know... I've been thinking... I have a really interesting thought that I wanted to share with you. What do you think? - What do you want, Will? - Hi Jess. So good to hear your voice. - I just got off of work and I want to go home. Is this something we can talk about later? - There's something I really need to show you. - I'm really tired, Will. - Jess, I can't explain it over the phone. Please just drop by. I promise it's not another painting. - You sound better. - I am. I'm a lot better. - Is everything okay over there? Something happened earlier. Something happened when I was on the phone with Terry. - You'll understand when you see it. - Come on Terry. - I don't see his car. You sure this is where he was going? - That's what the driver said. Rhinehart's Oyster Bar, Washington Road. - I'm starvin'. Can we eat here too? - Bro, how close are you? - I see you, I'm pulling in right now. - Oh, I see. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - John called, we have to meet him at the hospital. - Hospital? - How you doing? Rachel Clark? I'm Agent Tevis, this is Agent Banks with the FBI. - What do you want? - Want to ask you some questions, if you don't mind. - I'm working. - We won't be long. - What do you want to know? - Your colleague over there says that you are friendly with a Mr. Marcus Doyle? - What about him? - We happen to believe that he might be here. - Well, I haven't seen him. - You positive? It's pretty busy. - He's kinda hard to miss, don't you think? - Don't get snippy. - It's a touchy subject. I dated his buddy and it didn't end well. Once a cheater, always a cheater, right? - Hmm. It wouldn't happen to be this guy, would it? - Yep, that's him. - What's his name? - John. Johnathan Brandt. - We're looking for him, too. - Well, I haven't seen him, either. He's probably with Brent. - Brent who? He wouldn't be a friend of Marcus too, would he? - Look... These are good guys and I don't want to get them into any kind of trouble. - Darlin', they're already in trouble. - Yeah, we're trying to get them out of trouble. Look, I promise you we're here to help them. - You know what, let's start with an easy one. What's Brent's last name? - Fleming. - You sure? You hesitated a little. Brent Fleming? - Yes. - I want an APB on a Brent Fleming in any vehicle registered in his name. - Oops. Hey, could you get me a Diet Coke to go, please? Thank you. - Hello? - In here. - In the garage. Hey, thanks for coming. - You sounded... It concerned me. - So good to see you. I can't believe it's been a year. - Where are the others? I thought they'd be here. - I don't know, they're not here. - They left you here by yourself? - Yeah, I mean, I'm a grown-up, I can take care of myself. - What did you want to show me, Will? I can't stay long. - Still so hard to look at me, huh? - This is not the time for this. - Haven't I been punished enough? - That's not fair. - Fair to who? Since when is any of this fair? - I don't want to do this. - Jess, wait. - What are you doing? - What's it look like? - How? - That's what I'm gonna show you. This is amazing. Ready? Oh shit. - Apparently he doesn't have any family. It's just him. - So what do they expect us to do? - Nothing. The way the doctor explained, it's just a matter of time. - And John's with him? - Yeah, room four. - He was so alive just a few hours ago. You don't think-- - No. - The nurse said he was taking a lot of pain medications. I know what you're thinking. This wasn't caused by anything we did. Or it did. - Then how can you be so sure? - Let's just get this over with, okay? - My goal was to die teaching. - But you already are a teacher. - No, I mean physically teaching, right in the middle of a class, boom! Go out in a blaze of glory in front of a whole lecture hall full of students. - Yeah, that sounds a little crazy. - Yeah, but it's got a certain amount of panache. - Knock knock. - Oh, what a pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting company. - This is our friend Marcus. He was one of the people who found the object. - I've got someone else to thank. Thank you, Marcus. - We just want to let you know that we're here for you if you need anything. - Great, let's start with getting me the hell out of here. - What are you doing? - I am not spending the final hours of my life in a hospital. - I don't think that you can do that. - I can do anything I want. That's the privilege of the dying. - We should just go inside. - Don't get your panties in a twist. He'll be out in a minute. Visiting hours are over. - We don't even know if they're in there. - Oh, he's in there. - You know? - Yeah. It's a gut thing, cops have it. - I trust your gut like I trust your smile. - Look, you know the type. Feel like he got one over on us. Instead he got sloppy and make a mistake. - We should just go in and find out. - Let's just see how this Brent guy fits in. - Look, we're wasting time, and you know we don't have the time-- - Bingo. You should really trust my gut more often. - Hey, hey... It's okay, it's okay. I'm so sorry, that was really uncool. - What is going on? You were standing. Were you standing? And what was that thing? - Just go easy, okay? You fell and hit your head, so take it easy. - You were standing! - Yeah. - You were standing, I saw you! - Yes, I was standing, okay? It's a miracle. - Please tell me what is going on. - I'm sorry, I'm not trying to scare you. I'm really not trying to scare you any more. I'm so sorry. - What is going on? And what is that thing? - This... I'm gonna explain to you, I promise. This could be a new start for us. I really think that this could fix what we lost. - What? - No, Jess... Don't look at me like that Jess. - Don't touch me. - Listen Jess-- - No Will, don't touch me! Don't touch me! - Jessica? What are you doing here? What is she doing here? - I screwed up. - Can we deal with this later please? - Can someone please just tell me what is going on? - Where should we put him? - On the floor, by the alien. - Uh, really? - What? - Just do it. - Easy, Professor. - I can't really explain it, but it's amazing. It's amazing. - Will, Will, I discovered something amazing. It's collecting your DNA. Our DNA. The samples I took, they contained strands from you and from her. I don't understand it, but it's there, it's there. - Why? - I don't know, I'm not sure, but I have a theory that I wanted to test. - What is it doing to him? - It's helping him. But it wants our help, too. - What do you mean our help? - Hard to understand. It's telling me to let it touch you. - Telling you? - Asking. - Terry... - I want you to do it too. - We're gonna do it together, all of us. Look, I know you're scared. - Damn right! - Yeah, well, I was scared too. I've been scared all my life. I'm not gonna keep living in fear. And whatever this thing is, I don't believe that it means to hurt us. That's what I believe. Marcus, you have your faith. You know what I'm talking about. So stop being scared. - Bro, do you believe this? - I guess I do, yeah. - I guess I do, too. - If I'm right about this... - No! No, I have no idea what's going on! No, no, Will! No! - It's time. - I always wanted my life to matter for something. To mean something. And I was afraid it was too late for that, and I was afraid that I was going to die alone. And look how lucky I am! - He's gone. - It killed him! Did it kill him? - This exactly why I said I should've had first watch. - What's happening, Will? Do you know? - I don't know. Maybe part of its life cycle. Maybe he needs to grow. I don't know. - What, you telling me this thing's gonna get bigger? - Are you okay? Will, what is it doing? - Hold on, hold on. - What do you mean hold on? Is it hurting you? - It wants to touch... It wants to touch you. - Oh, I don't give a shit what that thing needs. - Please just... - Stay. Why is it hurting you? - It's not hurting. It's just telling me so much. For some reason this is important, though. - No. - Please? - No! - We'll understand what all this is about. Please, just please. - No! - Please! - No! - Fuck all of you! - FBI, get on the floor now! - Don't move, get down, don't move! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, be cool! - Don't touch my wife! - Don't touch me! - I don't wanna be here! - She needs her inhaler, asshole! - Get your hands off me! - Get back! - Don't move! - Shit, just lost picture. - Screw it, I'm going in. - No! - Cease fire, cease fire! - Hurry, hurry! Come on, baby. - Will! Will! - Just listen, please just listen to me. There's no time. I need you to let it touch you. - No, please, no, Will, no. - Please, I can feel it slipping away. - Sorry, I can't! - There's no time. - No, I'm sorry, no! - I need you. - I don't know what to do. - I don't want to be alone anymore. Why? Why did you leave me? I need you. - I'm so sorry. - Please don't leave me. Hurry up slowpoke. Around, around... See, that's it, you'll get it. Get some napkins. - Do you have to ask? - That's my girl. Sweetie, why don't you hand your ice cream to Mama while you get buckled, huh? - I can do it. - Listen to Daddy sweetie. - Don't take a bite. - When do I do that? - You always eat my ice cream. - Oh, you mean like this? - Mommy, stop! - Daddy, don't let her eat my ice cream. - I can't stay, Will. I can't stay! - Please don't go. - I'm sorry. - I am so sorry. - It wasn't your fault, I know it wasn't your fault Will. Will! - Banks, Banks! Good? - Yeah, go, go! - Marcus. You need to come with us. - What have you done? - Shannon? - I don't understand. Who are you? - I'm all of you.
