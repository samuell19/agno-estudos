Dalton vs. Dalton case. Complaint from Mr. Meriwether Dalton. My client's name is Meriwether Dalton... ...a respectable safe seller. He should be ashamed! A Dalton doesn't sell safes. He cracks them open! Laughter Hammer strikes But that's precisely the problem. As long as the Dalton name is synonymous with hold-ups... ...no one will buy a safe from someone named Dalton. To confirm our statements, we've summoned the man who knows... ...the Daltons best: Lucky Luke! Lucky Luke! Luck... ky... Lu... ke... Calm down, Joe. He can't stand... ...us mentioning the name of Lucky Luke. Grunt Lucky Luke! Who's that? LUCKY LUKE! Screams and grunts Howling Annoyed murmurs from Joe Dalton The session is adjourned! Lucky Luukkkke!!! Jazzy music It's Lucky Luke, the man who shoots faster than his shadow. Check that he pays for his stay. Just in case he's also the man who leaves faster than his shadow. Small laughter, whistling from Jolly Jumper Don't laugh, we're going to the New York court. We need a minimum of dress effort. Sighs of disappointment We gotta get outta here. If only I had a gun! Here, Joe. What's that? A gun. I carved it out of soap myself. I think it looks a lot like the real thing. Real thing? What real thing?! The one Ma' hid in the pie she sent us. I've been practicing with it for 3 weeks. It's not easy to carve soap. It slips. Three weeks! He's had a gun for 3 weeks! I'm gonna make him eat his soap! He'll see if it slips! I declare the meeting open again... Adjourned! Everybody out! What did he say? Everyone out! Or I'll take you down to calm my nerves! Screams of fear Someone has the hiccups. Averell, stop blowing bubbles! It's getting on my nerves! Screams of fear No... Yes. Yah! Neighing Alarm Barking, hitting, whimpering I hate dogs! Alarm We turn our backs for 5 minutes, and it's chaos. Honking A single mount allows one to sneak around town. Ho! Now what do we do, Joe? As usual: We terrorize, we rob, we plunder. Oh! Do you see what I see? Enchanting music How beautiful civilization is. Have you seen the prices, Joe? They're not cheap. We'll have to rob a bank to pay for them. We proceed in order: We hit the armory, then the bank. Jazzy music with a beat Can't we hit a pastry shop too? I'm always hungry. Whistle blow Stop! You ran a red light. A what? A red light. Are you blind? Ding! I have to write you a ticket. I'm in pursuit of dangerous criminals. Yeah, yeah, yeah! They all say that. Jazzy music There's money, over here. Shh, snap Banks! A street of banks! They talk badly about the city, but it has its advantages. Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes? Is it for a deposit? No, for a withdrawal! And make it quick! Right away, Joe. Pssschit... Not now, you fool! Explosion in the distance Echo of the explosion They're not wasting any time. Let's go, Jolly. Stop! Get out. Vehicle inspection. Brake shoe wear. Oh, a nail is missing. The horse is the only animal in which you can nail shoes. I'm going to murder him, kill him, gut him, exterminate him... Joe, you're the one who said: "Let's go for it." Yeah, Joe. There are still other banks to rob. Averell would make me forget the essentials. Is it for a deposit? Gunfire clattering Upbeat jazzy music Is it for a deposit? Panicked scream Is it for a deposit? Joe Dalton's laughter Is it for a deposit? Explosion I love New York! And have a... ...good day. No risk of that. Stop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Come on, move along. Hop! Hop! Hop! Jazzy music Cops... lots of cops! A street full of cops! Follow me. Joe whistles. Short ladder. The bags, quickly. HOP! HOP! HOP! Hop! Hop! Hop! Let's hide the bags... ...in this cart. The bags are hidden now, Joe. Let's blend in incognito with the walkers. HOP! HOP! HOP! Don't worry. Act natural. The police yell "hop" and Averell whistles. Averell giggles. (Very loudly) Hey, Joe, it's working! They didn't see that we're the Daltons! They're stupid, huh! I'm gonna to turn him into cornflakes! (Together) Calm down, Joe! HOP! HOP! HOP! Upbeat jazzy music Tickets, please. Shut that door or I'll shoot you! Police shouting Start it up or I'll put a hole in you! Joe Dalton cheers The Daltons!!! Averell cheers alone. Panicked screams But slow down! Where's the brake, Joe? No, stupid! It's my nose! Let me drive! Police sirens Joe, look! The Daltons! Sirens Yeah! Pizzas, Joe! Lots of pizzas! A street full of pizzas! We'll have lunch later. Let's make a break for it! Police sirens If they think they can catch us, they have another thing coming! Dalton howls Jazzy music with Chinese influences Upbeat jazzy music Everyone's driving the wrong way here! What's the police doing?! Police sirens Those city cops are tough. Hop! Ha! Ha! The pigs are going for a swim! Hey, Joe!!! Valse Joe, the view! Look at the view! Dalton howls Heavy fall Boat siren Hey, there are specific days for waste pickup. I had a pretty rough start to the day. So drop us off on the shore or I'll shoot you! Jazzy music We get the money and we go home. Anxious sighs Hey, which one did we stash the bag in, Joe? Well, they all look alike. Someone took our clothes! There are some dishonest people out there! I'll give you back your clothes... ...but you give me your guns. Hey, Joe! It's Lucky Luke! He found our clothes! You want our weapons, cowboy? Come and get them. Suspenseful western music Ha! Ha! Ha! Missed! You missed us, Lucky Luke! You're getting slow. Joe, why bother? He's faster than you. That's not fair! You're also going to give me the loot. The loot... What loot? Well, Joe, you know. The one... Shut up, Averell! Oh yes, the loot. We must have lost it during the chase. That's stupid. Are you the famous Lucky Luke? The crowd whispers the name of Lucky Luke. Yeah... My compliments! I'm Piotr Verkovitchkivintchkayoff. It's providence that sends you. We need you to drive us to California. We'll pay you very well. Sorry, I have enough money to pay for my lemonades. Plus, I have to take these 4 idiots to the penitentiary. What, cowboy? You, the defender of justice... ...the defender of orphans and widows... ...would you abandon these poor bastards to their fatal fate? Dramatic music Look at them closely, cowboy! They look like they could get lost in a cow pasture. You would leave them alone in the burning desert... ...to be preyed upon by cruel scalp-hungry redskins? Let's not insist, friends. We'll manage without him. No, no! No, you won't make it. Fear and thirst will be your only companions on the road. You will be preyed upon by coyotes, scorpions, and snakes. Your wives will collapse from exhaustion in an inhuman gasp. The dried up bodies of your children will feed the black vultures. Joe imitates the vulture's cry. But we're not afraid of anything, we Europeans. Murmurs Actually, we're afraid of a lot of things. Help us, Mr. Luke. They're all begging him. Ha! Ha! Ha! Alright, I'll take you to California. Cheering Oh, that's beautiful, what you said, Joe! We're all excited. Alright? Are you guys okay now? Listen, idiots. If Lucky Luke stays with them, we stay with the money. Oh, that was a plan! Joe, you're amazing! Joe, don't start with your plans! I don't understand them and they never work. Shut up, Averell! We'll take a path... ...Safe and easy. We will go through... ...Pennsylvania, Ohio... ...Missouri, Kansas... ...Colorado, Arizona, and finally California, which we will reach... ...in 6 months. ...What?! In 6 months? Impossible! We have to be in California in 80 days. 80 days?! Are you kidding? Why not around the world too? We all bought land in California. An exceptional site... ...lush grass, fruit trees as far as the eye can see! Oh, paradise! At an unbeatable price. A great deal. Yes, but if we don't take possession of the land in 80 days... ...the sale will be cancelled. And the honorable but far-sighted seller gets to keep the money. Which we paid in advance. This looks like a scam to me. A scam! Let's not jump to conclusions. No, dear sir, it's simply business. Mr. Crook, the land seller. We're in America. People are free to accept or refuse. And some must lose so that others may win. Sir...? Loucky Louke. He'll guide us to California. Loucky Louke... Lucky Luke? Yup. The departure is still scheduled for tomorrow. It will be April 12th. So I'll be waiting for you in California... ...in the presence of Master Bartelby, a bailiff by profession, on... The 30th day of the current year referred to as the expiration date. So if on June 30th, in exactly 80 days... ...you haven't taken possession of your land, the sale will be cancelled. Miss... Gentlemen, I wish you a safe journey. Jazzy music All sobbing. There's a faster way but much more dangerous. We have to go through Hole Gulch... ...but that means crossing the Deadly Desert of Death... ...and the territory of Mad Wolf, a fearsome Comanche chief. It won't be a walk in the park. I'll take the Daltons back to the penitentiary when you get to California. We'll get there, Lucky Luke. And do you know why? Because we think positive. And when we think positive, we don't think negative. Okay, my friends, see you tomorrow at dawn. We have 80 days to find the loot. We'll wait for night to search the wagons. Stop squeezing me like that! Symphonic music All... ...to the West! Yah! Neighing Russian song Lucky Luke... With such a man, these damned pioneers are capable of succeeding. We'll have to get rid of him, this hindrance to getting rich! Mr. Crook groaning Agreed, Crook. I'll take note. In California The lands! In California, we'll get the lands! Children recite the multiplication table. I presume... We get the loot then we kill Lucky Luke. No, we kill Lucky Luke first then we get the loot. Averell, stop polishing your ball! If I don't take care of my ball, it will wear out. I don't have a spare one. Angry shout You should polish your brain instead! Hits Oh, brotherhood is so beautiful. Come on, let's go! My damn (incomprehensible swear words) mules! Everyone in class! Is there a problem, Miss? Yes, this is not possible anymore. How can I teach politeness to my students with Mr. Barrow's insults? I'll move Ugly Barrow. Anything else to satisfy you, Miss? What? Uh no, it's fine... Surprised scream Oh... It's okay, I'm not hurt. Hey, Dalton brothers, take advantage of it, it's sales season. If you die, you'll have two funerals for the price of one. I can't help putting people into boxes. Oh, how handsome he is! I sense you're tense, my dear. Don't worry, I'm a great professional. Explosion, cry of pain Oh, you moved. Mr. Tang, is there any explosives on the menu tonight? Nothing of the sort, honorable and witty Lucky Luky. Your humble servant confused Sichuan pepper... ...with gunpowder. One must have the brain of a dizzy hummingbird... ...to put gunpowder in a pepper pot when it's clearly labeled... ...here, in very small print. Did someone confuse it for you, my explosive friend? Why such mistrust, dear Louke? Isn't there a certain someone who has every interest... ...in making sure you never arrive in California? Crook... You're talking about Crook?! But he would never do such a thing. He's an honest man, you can tell. It's curious, this propensity of New World inhabitants... ...to always expect the worst. Think positive! Fine specimen of optimism from the Old World, old chap. Yes, the kind of optimist that makes me pessimistic. I fear you have dosed it a little weak, Crook. Achoo! Aaaatcha! Aaaatchoo! Hey! Bivouac! Circle up! Form a circle! A circle? The circle... Well, yes, the circle. Crowd's noise To put people in a circle who aren't quite right... He doubts nothing. Brass and accordion music Are these quivering nostrils and undulating mane yours? A loud neigh I see you coming with your big boots. If you think you can just babble at me and make me swoon... Words are always poor to celebrate... ...the harmonious beauty of this rump... ...the exquisite fineness of these hocks... ...the perfection of the breeches... ...the admirable moiré of the mane. Oh, "the admirable moiré of the mane", that's a new one! A little laugh from the mare Cafeteria call Ginger pork, three-flavor pork... ...black mushroom pork... It's confusing. We need (swearing) numbers to keep track. Silent film piano with Asian sound What are these deliciously crispy little sticks? They are called chopsticks, honorable outlaw. Angry growl Nothing. The loot is not in this one. Damn ball and chain! Oh, Anastasia! Oh, California... What are you doing, Joe? Shh! We mark each cart we visit so we don't search the same one twice. Come on, you mollusks, get to work! Joe, you're a genius. Get me down, you idiots! Sorry, Joe. Joe growls. Escape with or without the loot... ...that is the question. Upbeat jazzy music Hey! Camp! Form the circle! My friends, the Missouri. So far, we're on schedule. I never doubted it. How do we cross the Missouri? By ford and with caution. Jolly Jumper's shiver Once you're in, it's good. It's stealing, and I know it. Don't you want an elephant with that? Light trumpeting No, I think that'll do. Move over, Bartelby. Come on, little ones, time for a snack. We'll see what you're going to do, Lucky Luke. fire 2 shots from his guns. Jazzy music in fashion style He's made quite a bit of leather goods! You need to consider a weighting coefficient... ...in the success of your schemes. Shut up, Bartelby! I'm greasing your palm enough, so don't creak. Noted. Today's menu: Ginger alligator, with three flavors... ...and black mushrooms. I could have lived in the North Pole. On the side of Aix or Avignon, I could have lived in the South Pole. Living in Bandol or Toulon. I could have lived in Alaska. In Kathmandu, in Borneo Yeah, but I live in La Ciotat With the sea and the boats My little one Me and my blue from China In La Ciotat We have a threesome What delicious name should we call you? Louise. Louise from Paname (Paris). And you, handsome? Jumper. Jolly Jumper. Quite a program. Western music Halt! You can't camp in the city but on a reserved site. Caws cries Come on, come on, my friends. In life, you have to know how to make concessions. You'll spend the night in the local jail. You won't lose your habits. The Daltons!!! Boo... People are locking themselves in. Ha! Ha! It's good to be back home. They're already here! It's hard to earn an honest living. We need to come up with something. Bartelby, any ideas? We could make it impossible for Lucky Luke to fulfill his moral obligations... ...towards the caravan. In other words, what does that mean? If the Daltons escaped, Lucky Luke would have to chase after them. Bartelby, remind me to increase your percentage. I was joking. Ho! Ho! Wow! Rantanplan! I've seen this cowboy somewhere before. You seem to know this dog, son. Rantanplan and I, we know each other well. I have his name on the tip of my tongue. He was sold as a guide dog. I'm afraid you've been taken for a ride. To be honest, I was starting to have doubts. There it is! Clint Eastwood! It's Clint Eastwood! I'm going to shake his paw. Pfff! Metallic creaking Look, Joe, the cannonballs are filled with sand. It's not just them. There's also your... Ow! Psst, the Daltons! It's Crook. I've prepared some horses. Enjoy them while... Ow! Ouch! What's it to you, crook?! Crook... Let's not exaggerate. Opportunist, at most. Get out! We'll escape when I decide! Are there any agreements and/or disputes with the proposal I made? They'll escape, or I'll eat my hat. Saloon piano Ow! That's what I call an atmosphere. Two ice cubes with a little pastis. Vodka! A beer. For me, it'll be a (unintelligible curses) of whisky! Lemonade! We only serve lemonade here. That's what I call lemonade. Coco, come here. Pour us some, it's my round. Worrying music Stranger, we don't like strangers here. They clatter their teeth. If you have something to say, say it to me... ...you (curses) patibulary! Guys, did you hear that?! He called me a (curses) patibulary! General fight! Shouting I'll leave you in good company, Jolly. Fight. Dear friend, you here? What a divine surprise. Yes, well the town, it's not divine. At home, we call it "the province." A lemonade. Aren't you going to fight? Never. A undertaker must keep distance with their future clients. Oh, my little Luke! Come join us. Yes, the natives have kindly invited us to participate in... Every Saturday, it's the same old song. Speaking of songs... Sam, play the music! They'll smack each other in rhythm. Piano, jazzy song. With a horse for companion, And the stars for a quilt, His only toy Is a six-shooter And dust for all stew. My handsome dude, my handsome cowboy, What shivers you give me My tough guy, my tender heart, Who never knows fear. When, when, when... When your sweetie is all flat Come do the radada on my roploplos When your sweetie is all flat Come do the radada, do the radada On my roploplos. When in the week Bullets whistle The jackal screams, the rattlesnake sounds The Apache hides Or the Comanche There's Molly for Sundays My beautiful coco, my beautiful cowboy What you give me, frifri of shivers Molly, it's me Molly Muffin Molly for short, for friends When, when, when...

Radada! Roploplo! Roudoudou and roploplo! ... Ah, the contemplation of the calm moonlight... ...plunges my heart into exquisite bliss. How sad... How beautiful... Don't you think? You really are not a horse like the others. And the beaten-up cowboy, is it the local cocktail? But first, take off your boots, my dear. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Saloon music If they want to go to California, don't stop them. What's the saying again? The caravan passes and the dogs... The dogs... The dogs follow it! Next time, I'm taking a cat. I'm going to use a trick. A Sioux trick? No, a con man's trick. Ouch! They'll escape, Bartelby! They'll escape! Or I swear that I'll eat my hat. Ouch! In California Land, land! In California Land, we'll have it! Suspense music Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Crook's cries of pain Oh, I dreamt we were eating. Snoring Oh, the beautiful gun! It will serve as a model to sculpt another one. This time, Joe won't be able to say it's not resembling. Chills, scream It's cold! Unintelligible words Can you explain, please? Um... Hey, look! I'll show you a trick I taught to Rantanplan. Rantanplan, stay still! Be quick! That voice, that inner strength... How to resist? Go get it! They never take us seriously. Especially Joe. Mostly Joe. My master, I found my master! I'm going to jump into his arms out of respect. Crash Well, Rantanplan, what's wrong? The loot! It was there! It's not safe to leave it here like this. I know a better hiding place. Later, I'll tell Joe about it. He'll be so happy! Ha! Ha! Ha! Joe, I think I'm going to impress you. Master? Master, are you there? Master? Master? Are you there? Come on, let's get to work. We'll find that loot for sure. By the way, Joe, I need to tell you something... Shut up, Averell! Whistling The weather's hot for the season. (The three) Yeah, but there's a cool breeze. Whistling The weather's hot for the season. (The three) Yeah, but there's a cool breeze. The weather's hot for the season. The weather's hot for the season. What's with this traffic? Jazzy music Coos Yawns Yes? What is it? The weather's hot for the season. Hits and shouts Poupoune! Oh no! It's wood! You're going to feel the roller! You disgusting old man! I didn't do anything, I swear, my sweet! Pig! Hits and accusations Let's calm down a bit! We can't hear ourselves search around here! Excuse me, can I borrow your ball? He breathes, relieved. Yes, of course. You're very kind. Incredible! All these carts look alike. There are the same objects in the same places. I have the impression that I have already searched this one. I'm done, grazie. You're welcome. The crosses! Jazzy upbeat music The crosses! Someone erased the crosses! Lucky Luke! It can only be Lucky Luke! Ckuly Cuke! The weather is hot for the season. Yeah, but there's a cool breeze. You're lucky, my friend. I also have my first aid certificate. Bring down Lucky Luke! I'll do it! Bring down Ckuly Luke! You seem worried, my friend. We're approaching the Deadly Desert. An ideal place for an ambush. Come on, Luke. You have to think positive, I tell you, positive! Everything has gone remarkably well so far, hasn't it? Yeah... Why don't they escape? It's incomprehensible. They will escape willingly or by force... They will escape! Shock, cracking Snoring Come on, come on! Giddy up! Come on! Tagada! It's not working. We need to tell them: ..."Come on, giddy up, you damn (incomprehensible swear words)... ... "mules!" Uh... thank you. You're welcome. Well, well, well... Drilling sound Water leaking sound. Come on, giddy up, you damn (swears) mules. Hum... take down Lucky Luke... Murmurs He will die... What's going on? I'm breaking you out. Anxious music Joe screams But I don't want you to break me out! How many times do I have to tell you?! But come on, a Dalton who refuses to escape... ...is not a Dalton! Think about your reputation. My reputation is where and when I want it to be! Uh... what was that, Joe? We've been kidnapped! Shame on us. Ah, but you expressly committed yourself to it. Ask me why I'm still in such a good mood, Bartleby. Why are you still in such a good mood? Because the caravan will never make it to California. Someone has punctured a hole in the water tank. We won't have enough water to cross the desert. We'll drink our sweat if necessary, Lucky Luke! But we'll make it. Positive... Jazzy song Oh, what a beautiful sandy beach! I can't see the sea, it must be low tide. Hey, I'm going to look for some seashells! Rantanplan's cry of pain Oh, a shrimp! Aggressive cries No, it's a prawn. Today: Cactus with ginger, three flavors, and black mushrooms. Well, let's go for the ginger then. Next! Wow! Why did Lucky Luke take this path? Maybe he wanted to lose us in this desert... But it's Lucky Luke, we have to trust him. He chases the outlaws... for the rewards! Only for the rewards! The money. Under the guise of a generous protector, is actually a being... ...venal, calculating... ...stingy, heh heh! Yeah! Proof: for all these years, he's been wearing the same clothes. Joe whistles. Whistling Gentlemen. A leak? Yes, a leak, so they say. You know what? We saw him lurking the day before. Right next to the tank. Of course, I didn't say anything. WATER! TO DRINK! WE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! Sorry, the remaining water is reserved for the animals. Maybe you're keeping it for yourselves? You don't seem to be suffering from thirst. Crowd protests. Come on, comrades! We're a big family that must remain united. Together, we're not alone. Trust must reign between us. And if he was paid by Crook to mislead us? Down with Lucky Luke! TO DEATH, LUCKY LUKE! To death, Lucky Luke! I must admit that crowds have always scared me. I'm not afraid of anyone It works! They're going to bring him down! Even if he's quick, he won't be able to do anything against all of them. Averell howls. Help! Help! Hoo! Laughter and strange cries. Thunder rumbling. Joyful cries. The rain dance... Averell did the rain dance. Are you okay, Roger? I was abducted by five extraterrestrials! With a smell, I'm telling you! Joe screams in anger. My plan is ruined! Ouch! It's not my fault, Joe! I never understand your plans! Owww! Oh, we're not helped at all! Not helped! Not helped! Not helped! Not helped! Not bad for a beginner. I have good news and bad news. The good news: In 2 days, we'll be in California. Joyful cries. And the bad news: ...we have entered the territory of Crazy Wolf. Mr. Tang, we'll be eating cold today. No fires. Spread the word. If you value your scalp, no noise tonight. Noise? But we don't make any noise. What are you talking about? Well, yes, Joe. You know, when we're looking for the loot... Shut up, Averell! Everyone keep an eye on their corner of the caravan. Keeping an eye on a circle's corner... That's a good one. Sniffing sound Damn it! A fire?! But who could have done such a thing? Should I conclude that you're not the manual type? Message beeps Horse neighing Hey! Mad Wolf, our leader, there's smoke on the horizon. I see it, Little Brain. But what does that smoke say? "There's smoke on the horizon!" Little Brain wants a tomahawk hit? It's my fault there's smoke on the horizon... ...who says there's smoke on the horizon? What do these signals say? That there's smoke on the horizon. But some of them are completely unknown to me. War drums Oh, a turkey! One turkey, two turkeys, ten turkeys... That's a lot! Let's observe on our left a very good example of the local population. Wow! Indians! Cool! Me, I'm Pocahontas! Oh no, it's always you! Honking War cries Should we form the usual circle? No, we're going to shake things up. Valse It's a topsy-turvy world! Crazy Wolf wants to parley! Stop the ride! I'll go see what he wants. Growling Hugh. Not bad. And you? The brave ones should turn around the caravan, and not the other way around! Crazy Wolf is right. Forget all that and let us go. No paleface dares to cross Crazy Wolf's territory! Result: Crazy Wolf is the laughingstock of other chiefs. He doesn't have a single paleface scalp and that makes him even crazier. For once, we have scalps within reach, we won't let them get away. I'll be back. Soft sighs Admiring murmurs Thank you. It's a great sacrifice that you're making... ...Mr. Pierre. The other chiefs will be jealous! Let's celebrate! Crazy Wolf invites the pale faces to his village. Cheering Sorry, but we have an appointment. Another time, perhaps. Well, just one little drink then. Indian drums Just a precautionary measure. I don't want you to start another war. I will bring you something to eat. If there are chopsticks on the menu, I'll take some. My master's brothers are my brothers. I want to cuddle them. No, no! Get out, you dirty dog! It's wet! It's disgusting! I hate dogs! Are we going to witness the famous ceremony of the peace pipe? Not quite. Let's share the peace patch. Crazy Wolf has definitely stopped the peace pipe. Yeah, me too. Was it hard for you to quit? Yeah, I chewed on a piece of oats for a long time. Sorcerer's chant Our sorcerer: True Hawk. He heals warts... ...repairs bisons and predicts the future. In the age of the steam engine, how can anyone believe in this nonsense? The squaw with the mole eyes doesn't believe in the powers of the sorcerer? I only believe in one thing: Progress. Let True Hawk predict the future of the pale faces... ...to show our incredulous brothers... ...the power of Comanche magic! Pop-rock song Is it over? Can we go now? Oh, I could use another patch. Damn it! We can no longer count on the Indians to massacre a caravan. There's still the bridge. The bridge? The bridge. After the bridge, it's California. There's 24 hours left to find the loot and kill Lucky Luke. Joe, I have to tell you... Averell, for once, shut up! Luckily, I have a plan. What is it, fool? When you have a plan, I get hit. So, I anticipate. Hits And this one, did you anticipate it?! This is starting to cost me a lot. You're not interested in the elephant? Light trumpeting No, I don't want an elephant. I don't like elephants! I hate elephants! I abhor elephants! I see. A hippopotamus, then? You're more of a hippopotamus person. What if we send those (incomprehensible swear words) Daltons first? No way! No, no! But where's the problem? Well, let's see. Suspenseful music Everything's fine, it seems solid. It squeaks a little. Explosion Ah! Lucky Luke! Anxious music Triumphant music Thank you... That was close. No problem, I love lending a hand. We narrowly avoided a disaster. Yes, we were lucky! I'm the specialist of puns. I've got you, Mr. Barrow! It's okay, Miss. I can manage on my own. (incomprehensible swear words) I grant you, I underestimated the recoil. But now, it's certain, they won't arrive on time. Bam! I keep the land and their money. I'm so wicked! Ah! Evil laughter The next bridge is a 6-day walk away. Going down and up with the wagons will take too long, sorry. But this can't be happening! Not now! Not here! Not so close to the goal! May I suggest something, gentlemen? Let's use the tarps of the wagons: We transform them into balloons and we fly. We'll need to lighten the wagons, but theoretically, it's feasible. YEAH! LONG LIVE THE MISTRESS! There's a catch. My hearse isn't a model with a tarp as standard. Same for the tanker wagon. And my humble mess wagon. Disappointed murmurs I'm sorry, that was stupid. Not as much as you think, Miss. Molly? Inaudible whispers That's a bold idea, cowboy. I like it. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! And that's how, with underwear, we come out on top. Is everyone ready? Um... Well, in that case, come on, everyone up in the air! Fasten your seatbelts! Ready for takeoff! Russian song Emergency exits are located on either side of the aircraft. A life jacket is located under your seat. Usually, it's my customers who go up to heaven. Onward, brave comrades! All to the West! I'm flying! I'm flying like the cows! I should have invented the in-flight meal trays. Hey, Joe! Look down there! It's far! (Stuttering) Shut up, Averell! Mule braying I'm sure we'll soon be crossing America in flying machines. And why not go to the moon? All right. Ha! Ha! We can consider that they have lost. Allow me not to subscribe to your assertion. What do you expect to happen? That. Hello, Mr. Crook! We're here! Hey, Joe! That's it! We've landed! Not flying. Don't like flying. We won! Joyful cries. Bartelby clears his throat. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. I, Harold Bartelby, sworn bailiff, declare that the named... ...purchasers have fulfilled the conditions specified in the contract. They can therefore legally... ...enjoy the ownership of the lands sold by the named seller: ...Edgar Crook! Gentlemen, the valley is yours. Festive music. Uh... no, your land is this one. Funeral march. This, a paradise?! But we (swear words) will never get anything to grow on this (swear words) land! Oh, Crook! Have you lied to us? Lied, lied... Big words right away. It's marketing, that's all. Negative... You... you... are negative! Hang him, that'll teach him. Screams Shot fired. Alright, he's a scoundrel, but he must be judged. Listen to him! He's always gave good advice. First, we hang him! Then, we judge him! Let's hang him twice! With tar and feathers! Oh, stop chattering! The prey flies away! Crook... Crook. Howl of fear Crook... Crook... Crook. Let's risk everything. My friends! You know that under our bad boy appearances... ...a heart beats in our chest. Yes, you welcomed us and treated us... ...as equals. To thank you, I'll reveal a secret to you. Somewhere, hidden in one of your wagons, is a fortune. A huge fortune! The result of our past heists. This fortune, we offer it to the community. Find it and it's yours! A fortune, he said? Hidden in a wagon, he said? Wait! No need to look for it! It's here! Unlocking Ta da! OHHHH! But... how did he do that? And is my IQ made of chicken? While you were sleeping, I replaced the sand in the balls... ...with money! Aren't you lucky to have a handy brother? On behalf of everyone, thank you... ...for this infinitely generous gesture. We will name a street after you. We will erect a statue in your likeness! Oh, thank you! Thank you! No! It's my money. No one touches my money! Ah, but you gave it to me. A gift is a gift. AND TO TAKE BACK IS TO STEAL! What do we do, Joe? We're getting out of here. Upbeat jazzy music STOP THIEF! Children, surprise geology quiz, follow me! Sales? It's sales season and no one told me. It seems Joe has gotten his loot back. Rantanplan, keep an eye on him. Okay, I got it. I'm coming! How about we increase our capital, Bartelby? Fifty-fifty. Hubbub On the left are remains of pyrite and galena deposits. They make shopping malls without shops. You're the dumbest dog in the West. Howling I got him! No, he's mine now! I got him! He's mine! He's mine! Children's cheers He's mine. That's my money! No, he's mine. Police sirens Howling Laughter Joe, you have to look before you cross. Bartelby, I'm fine. Ahhhh! Howling, heavy fall Bartelby, it seems like luck is smiling on us again. Joe! Lucky Luke! Female scream Help! Gunshot Ha! Ha! Ha! The great Lucky Luke missed his shot. Joe! The exit! Not already! Whistling wind Muffled cry Children's cheers It's okay, we weren't even scared. Children's joyful cries A gun... If only I had a gun! Choose, Joe. You'll never guess which one is the real one. Where does he get these guns from? Does he collect them? Undo your belt, cowboy, or I'll shoot her! Suspenseful music Throw it away. Finally... I've been dreaming of this moment for so long. Nothing can stop me now from taking you down, Luckycky... Luke... Ckuly Kule! Goodbye, cowboy. And bang! Ricochets My name is Luke, Joe. Lucky Luke. It's not fair! I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! I'll get my revenge! Strange cries Incomprehensible muttering Chicken's cry I'll kill him! I'll mimic the chickens! Come on! And my IQ, is it chicken?! Warrior cry Ouf... I'm also a gymnastics teacher. Hands in the air! Suspenseful music Whispers You've exhausted your quota of luck. Always in league with dishonesty. Your quota of humor, on the other hand, is inexhaustible! They couldn't get here in 80 days. How many caravans have you swindled? A dozen. It's a small business. But it pays well. Several decades in prison, count on me. Oh, you're touching. This old conservative hero side of you, "I'm going to punish the bad guys"... Wake up, Lucky Luke! We're in the 19th century. Remove the shackles. My money! Luke, do something! He's taking off with my money! That should keep you busy for a while! Ha! Ha! Rantanplan! No, let go of that! Are you the one making the "pschiiit", Bartelby? And why would I make a "pschiiit", Crook? Well, you're making a "pschiiit", Bartelby. I'm telling you, I'm not making a "pschiiit", Crook. Joyful panting We put our hand in front of our mouth before sneezing. I told you, Crook, that you could count on me. Look! Gold! Cheers of joy Rhythmic music Hey, Louke... positive. Calm down, this gold is mine! These are my lands! No, they belong to them now. I've taken note. Ahhh! Give me back my lands, you filthy poor people! These are my lands! My lands! Ah! Not too tight for me. My money! It's my money! My lands! These are my lands! Louise, I've had delightful moments in your company. But I'm the faithful courier of a hero who takes up all my time. Which doesn't marry well with commitments... Neigh of joy Okay, I get it. Cut the farewell scene short, handsome. It's wearing out everyone's hooves. There will always be a cowboy between us. So, Louke... You... you're leaving? Yep. I... We have a proposition for you. We need a sheriff in our new town... Sheriff? Not at all! We need a school principal. Uh, actually... No, we're going to raise a bunch of (swear words) mules together! No, with a wick that size, a hairdresser is necessary. People arguing Timeout! Well, I'll leave you guys. Luke is not a commodity! Comrades! What if we asked him for his opinion? Louke? He has... he's disappeared. Faster than his shadow. Joe, do you know what's happening to me? I have a plan. Joe's angry cry Incomprehensible words from Joe Upbeat music I don't like cows!
