You piss me off. I got to play this in front of the all school.. It?s very important for me.. Well, thanks, much better... Now I will be able to focus well on my love scene. Your love scene? Yehaa, it is Romeo and Juliet. And who plays Romeo? Jeremy, a classmate. Are you jealous? - Here is Thomas, he wanted to see a rehearsal. - Hi Hi. Are you interested in drama? Yes, yes, very much! Wonderful! Now Romeo and Juliet, let's go on the stage We're going to rehearse the first kissing scene. Let's go. ?O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do They pray... "They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.." "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake." "Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take." Cut! Wait Tomas, it's very kind of you... but I am the producer here! All right? Yeah, ok. Go on... "Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again. "You kiss by the book." Let's take a break. Cecile you?re doing great... Really. You were very good. But for the kiss... could you put in in it a little bit more? Do you want her to give a french kiss? - Are you crazy Tomas? - Wait. wait... It's a wonderful idea... And it would be modern! Let?s keep it. Carry on! I'm sorry. Hello? Really? Ok... Thank you very much. Good bye. It was William?s School. They?ve accepted my submission. Do you realise? The William's school! Well... They want to see me again... But I won?t be long... It?s very close from here. I can't believe it... I am sorry Paul. Who?s William? No one! It?s a theatre school... Thomas wait! You could play the supporting role while she's away? Me? Well... yes... So we can see what you're made of! "For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss." "Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?" "Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer." Stop! Stop! Stop... How do you want Jeremy to play it right if you don?t? Well... I don?t know... Play it easy, ?the Italian way?, ok? Go on! "Ayi, pilgrimo, lips..." No, no, no... The Italian way? means you just tell the lines, unaffected, with simplicity. - You think you can do that? - Yes. Good. "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. "Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take..." "Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged." "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." "Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again." Jeremy I would like you to put more intensity in your role. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair..." "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake..." "Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take" "Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged?" "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." "Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged!" "Give me my sin again" "You kiss by the book." Sorry... Thomas, Bravo, you're amazing! O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair." "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake." "Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take..." Thomas? What are you doing here? Well, nothing, just giving the lines... Are you kidding? You were great! Was I? I am so happy! They take me! Well, very good! Don?t you say anything? Aren?t you happy for me? Yes, yes, it?s great! Bye Thomas. Bye. Goodbye Thomas! And thank you. What have you done to him? "Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged." "Then have my lips the sin that they have took." "Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! " "Give me my sin again." "You kiss by the book." Bravo, Jeremy. Thanks... You're really kind... But... shouldn?t you give it to Cecilia? "Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake." No... But... Did you really think...? I am sorry Thomas, but... I was acting... Thomas...Thomas... "I still will stay with thee; And never from this palace of dim night Depart again... Here Will I set up my everlasting rest, And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh. Thus with a kiss, I die!
