He's awake, Doctor. It looks all right. Where am I? In a hospital? A private hospital. Private hospital? Am I sick? You were, but you're better now. Open your mouth. Does it hurt? No, just a little stiff. It'll ease with time. And here? All right? What did I have there? It's just a scar now. What happened? When a drunk man drives at 100 miles an hour, he is likely to have an accident. An accident? Was I alone? Luckily your wife was thrown clear by the impact. The cast can come off. Just a bandage, for support. My wife? Thrown clear? Yes, and you were almost thrown out of this world. Instead you spent three weeks in a coma. Now get some rest. Everything's taken care of. - Doctor. - Calm yourself You said that... - my wife... - She's all right. Relax. At last. I'm so grateful for all you've done for my husband. Don't mention it. I've brought your master home, Kim. Help me. Are you all right, sir? Master is fine. Your bedroom is ready, sir. - Be polite to Kim. - That's Kim? Give a hand. - Would you care for anything, sir? A small cup of coffee, Kim. - Two cars? - She's three days old. Brand new. Like you. You've made a few changes since I left, haven't you? No, nothing at all, darling. It looks different somehow. Come up to your room. Watch your step. I hope you haven't changed my room. - Kim only put some flowers in. - I love flowers, I always have. - I know that, darling. Flowers, Chinese furniture, Buicks. - What a life. - Silly. No, no. It's here. Well, if you'll allow me, I'd like to go into my room alone. Well, Kim, I see you didn't forget the flowers. But... where is the television? But Georges, you know you hate television. Do I? I get confused. I love flowers and I hate television. Enough nonsense. Get into bed. No, Kim, Master undresses all by himself, like a big boy. Silly. You called, sir? Yes. Go and tell Madame that I want to see her. - Go ahead. - I beg your pardon, sir? I said, "Go ahead." Move. Go. Understand? Master will speak to Madame. To whom will he speak? He will speak to whom? He's going to speak to whom? Master will speak to Madame. - You called me? - Yes. Master called Madame. To kiss her? Not exactly. Sit down. And be a good girl. Georges Campo wishes to ask Christiane Campo a few questions. First of all, are you sure you're my wife? If you start like that, I'll leave. Go ahead. You leave and I'll get a divorce. They'd refuse you. You don't have any valid grounds. When a chap has an accident and doesn't recognise his wife when he recovers, that's grounds for divorce, isn't it? All right. We'll get a divorce. sit down. - I'm listening, darling. - So, you are my wife? - And this fabulous place is mine? - All yours. From what I can see, we're rich. We brought everything back from Hong Kong, darling. Hong Kong. And I had a business there. What kind of business? - Construction. By the way... do we have any children? - Not yet. - Are you sure? We'll take care of that oversight. I'm for having four children. Four boys, agreed? Why don't we start right now? We'll talk about children when you're all recovered and healthy. I feel healthy enough. Amnesiac, sex-mad, cynical. You have all the faults. I shouldn't love you, but I do. Ask Mao to bring me some tea. Right away. Tea and a copy of Mao's thoughts. Madame asks you, sir, not to forget your pills. Sir will not forget. How long have you worked for me now, Kim? Seven years, sir. And when did we come back from Hong Kong, Kim? One month before your accident, sir. - Did I speak Chinese? - Yes, sir. A few words. What does this mean? It's Freddie. What the hell is he doing here? Mr. Campo, the situation is getting very complicated. But Christiane, there's no reason, absolutely no reason to hide who I am, since he is sick. And if he's only pretending? All the more reason to tell him the truth. Let me do it my way. But why didn't he recognise me? And why didn't he say anything about having amnesia to the doctor? Because when you're married to a woman as beautiful as Mrs. Campo, certain memories are bound to come back. - How are you? I saw you arrive from the window. - What's your name? Do you recognise my voice? - What's my name? - Old Man Moses. Did you come here to louse up this wonderful deal, Freddie? It was too good to be true, Freddie. Don't stop, Kim. Kim, what do you think - is... my husband acting... or does he really have amnesia? Master is sick, I'm sure of it. But he is happy to believe he is Madame's husband. Don't stop, Kim. Just like that, my name is Georges Campo? - And Christiane is my wife? - And you're a doctor? - And we've been friends for ten years? And you, Christiane and I, we just came back from China, - I mean Hong Kong, six weeks ago? - Correct. I must tell you, right now my memory is like Hiroshima. All that's left is a big jumble. You're the only one I recognise and all I remember are bars, night clubs - and wild parties. - Of course. We used to go out on the town together in Kowloon. - While Christiane was making couscous? - What? No, no, lacquered duck, shark fins. You're confusing it with Algerian food. Just my luck. I hate Chinese food. And three weeks ago you loved about it. Well, I say I hate Chinese food and I love méchoui, couscous and mint tea. Everything's mixed up. Even my exotic tastes. What about you, you're a doctor? Frédéric Launay, M.D. Chatham Road, Kowloon. Freddie, do you mind if I stare at you? I'll have to take your word for it, right, Freddie? Look, don't worry, your memory will return - either all at once, or little by little. What's the matter? Is your wife too beautiful for you? Are you joking? She's a knockout, it's just... I can't remember ever, you know. All this money, Buicks, a château... I'm just afraid of waking up and go back to being - Pierre Lagrange. - Why Pierre Lagrange? Where's Mao Tse-tung, on vacation? Chairman Mao is sewing some of my dresses. The Chairman knows how to do everything. - Is he a barber too? - Why, darling? Because even staying in bed, my hair keeps on growing. You can go into the village as soon as you're well. Can I? You're not a prisoner, dear. Anyway Kim has lots of talents, if you want, he can reshape your head any time. You know, that Pierre Lagrange annoys me. If only you knew how much. By the way, - did I talk that vulgar in Hong Kong? - Very vulgar. But I don't mind that so much, but stop talking about your Pierre Delagrange. - Not Delagrange. Lagrange. What's funny... is that I'm starting to remember things. - Well, not really. Words. - What words? Freddie. Yes, Freddie. We had a big house in Tai Hang, on Tai Hang Road. Chatham was where Freddie had his office. He lived in Kowloon and spent all his weekends with us. And Mina? Was that a place too? Mina was Eurasian. She lived in Aberdeen. - She was your mistress. - My mistress? Yes. You should have a picture of her somewhere. And... you weren't jealous? And I was foolish enough to have an affair? Yes, darling, you were. What's this? - You sleep with a jacket now? - No, just checking my wardrobe. Come on, get to bed. Have you taken your medicine? Not yet. Come on, quick or I'll denounce you. - To whom? Mao Tse-tung? - To Frédéric. Great. Then he'll triple the dose and I'll go even more insane. Impossible. Now get to sleep. You know what the doctor said, calm and lots of sleep. You're a rich contractor in Hong Kong. Your house is on Tai Hang Road. A one-story villa. You grow tropical flowers in your hothouse. In the living room, there is a large Chinese display in red and gold lacquer. Inside it, there is a collection of opium pipes. Your office is in Hong Kong, Mina lives in Aberdeen. You gave her a brooch, a gold scarab. You play gin rummy with Freddie. With Freddie and Christiane. Your wife, Christiane. Gold scarab. Full of tropical flowers. Mina lives in Aberdeen. Gold scarab. My stockings. At last, some fresh air. - Do you want your cane? - No, I'll be fine. - Do you feel all right? The body and chassis are in good shape. But the motor, that's another story. - What are those buildings over there? - Some old barns. The former owners farmed the land. - Anyone live there now? - No, it's abandoned. - Do you want to see it? - Yes, come on. You know those damned pills of yours are making me groggy. But you're getting your memory back, little by little aren't you? Yes, bits of it. - Perhaps all that effort is making me confused. - Of course. Quite a machine. - What's up there? - A loft. It's used for storage, I think. It smells like apples. Do you want some? I'll go. Georges! What happened? What's the matter? - What happened? - Take a look. I should be down there with a broken back. What do you mean? Why didn't you tell me there was a trap door? I didn't know. I've only been here once before. It must have been locked. Why didn't you warn me? What do you mean? - You don't think that I... - Why did you bring me here? You were the one who wanted to come. And the trap door just happened to be open, by accident. How can you even think that I... You sound as if you're... Mad? Go ahead, say it. Your turn. I've never had so much tea in my whole filthy life. If it's any consolation, darling, 700,000,000 Chinese drink tea too. - Anyway, don't talk about life like that. - I'll talk about my life any way I want to. Are you going out? I've got a headache. I'm going for a walk. - Who does this monster belong to? - Prince? To you. - Who else would he belong to? He's yours. - I'm glad to know that. - You knew that, didn't you? - You forget that I'm a little... Even my own dog doesn't recognise me. Why would he attack me? - Maybe he has amnesia too. - No. He's never had an accident. You let that monster loose, and he'll eat his own parents. - Doesn't that music bring back memories? Where's the phone? - Who do you want to call? - A vet. - I'm having that dog put down. - He's my dog, isn't he? - Anyway, there's no phone. No phone? It takes six months to get a line. But you're a doctor, you do it. He's my dog isn't he? - I want him killed. - You'd regret it in three months. - Why in three months? - Because you'll be cured by then. Cured. - What are you doing here? - You rang for me, sir. I did? I went back to sleep. Did you sleep well, sir? Not bad. Your pills, sir. Kim, come here. Here. Nearer. Take off your coat. Go on. Take it off. Show me your shoulder. - Who did that? Did I? - Why? - I made a mistake, sir. What mistake? I forgot to tell the garage to bring the car. What car? What garage? A year ago, sir. It was in Hong Kong. It was the American car you had. Get dressed. It's better if he stays in his room and rests. But, Frédéric, how long do you think he can stay cooped up in here? Frankly, I don't know. But there is no point in getting excited. We won't accomplish anything by losing our heads. What can we do, Frédéric? I'm terribly worried. There's no need to be. It's a slow process, that's all. His memory is coming back little by little. Like pieces of a puzzle falling into place. Frankly, don't you think he should be examined by a... By who? A psychiatrist? Who would lock him up. No, calm and rest, here, are his best medicines. He sometimes looks so worried. Just yesterday he asked me if we weren't keeping him prisoner. Well, in a way, we are. But what else can we do? Take him for a drive in the car? No. He's starting to get his balance back. You should explain that to him, Frédéric. I already have. Until he is cured, he has to stay here. frankly... do you really want him to recover his memory? I don't know. Or rather, I do know. He was violent, brutal and selfish. He married you. He was very fond of you. He was fond of his dog too. Now he wants to kill it. I want him to recognise me but I'm afraid that when he does, he'll go back to what he was before, instead of staying the way he is now. And he'll look at me like a stranger, just when I... Just when you're starting to love him? Perhaps. - Were you waiting for me? - No. You were here already. I have news for you. Yes, sit down. Now listen to me. From now on I will try very seriously to be very obedient. What if the best way to bring back your husband's memory would be to make love with him? First of all, it's forbidden. By who? By that crank Freddie? That's right. By that crank Freddie. I'll have a little talk with him. It's prohibited until you're completely recovered physically. And then Mr. Campo, we're still going to wait until some night when you're nice enough to remember, without any doubt, that I really am your wife. You mean it would be like cheating on me? I don't want to cheat on my husband with a man who isn't sure he is my husband. - And if I were sure of it? - You'd have to prove it. To prove it to you and the dog. What if you and the dog tried a little harder? See? I'm trying. I swallow... I drink and I sleep. You're losing your mind, going completely insane. You beat Kim with a whip. You were brutal. You got drunk with British officers. You're losing your mind. You gave the gold scarab to Christiane, not to Mina. You gave Mina dresses, very expensive dresses from Paris, dresses from Balenciaga. "Yes" is "How". "No" is "Poo-How". "I'm thirsty" is "Wo-k'o-lay." "I'm hungry" is "Wo-ngo-lay." Georges Campo, the pipes form a rare collection. Telephone call for Mr. Pierre Lagrange. What's the matter? Can't you sleep? A nightmare. We were in a bar. - There was a call for Pierre Lagrange. - Is he back again? And I automatically went to answer it. Well, hang up. Wrong number. Listen Freddie, there's something phony here. I didn't invent that name. I didn't invent all these scenes, these memories. What memories? Of a war... villages burning, houses, farms, Arab mechtas, the hills of Kabylia. I see all that. A bus taking me on a weekend pass, a comrade playing the harmonica, another throwing up. That's not very impressive. I've seen all that in a hundred movies. And I tell you I've seen it, with my own eyes. You, Christiane, Georges Campo, it just doesn't fit. It's a dream, it just doesn't make sense. And you and your Lagrange? Does that make sense? Did you learn Chinese in Algeria? Did you meet Christiane and me in Kabylia? Did you have your Chinese mistress in the Casbah? Did your accident happen in the Sahara? What the hell do you want? You want a certificate from city hall, from the parish priest to prove that you are you? I'll prove it to you. But in my dream, I went to the phone without hesitating. Listen, it doesn't mean a thing if you're somebody else in a dream. Just this morning, between midnight and seven, I discovered penicillin. Come on. And don't forget your medicine. You need it. Let's not play games. Do you want to be put in a mental hospital? Where were you headed? I don't know. To the police. Let's go. But you know where you'd go next? An institution. Shall we go? My name is Lagrange, my dog wants to bite me, my wife and my companion are keeping me prisoner. Can you imagine what they will think when they hear that tale? Well, if you're a real friend, you won't tell Christiane about this. Because yesterday I told her I was making progress. Now if she knows I was roaming around like a lost dog... If she doesn't see us come in, I won't say anything. If I were you, I'd pretend to be Asterix, he's much more popular than that Pierre - what's his name? That's it, Lagrange. You're right, you're going mad. Georges Campo is back from China. You're lost. Suicide, to free yourself. Only suicide can free you. There's a pistol in the drawer. In the drawer. Pistol. Take the pistol, Georges. Suicide. It's the only way to escape. The only way. You're going mad, Georges. You must kill yourself. The pistol. Madness, the only way. The pistol. Georges, Frédéric has bought you a bicycle. Aren't you pleased? Freddie's great. And so are you, Mrs. Campo. Come on, Georges, don't be silly. - Aren't you pleased with my progress? - Yes, but behave yourself. What are you doing? You're hurting me. Are you mad? Of course! A man has to be insane if he wants to make love to his wife. Not like this, later, not yet. Remember what I told you. I'm feeling more and more normal, - really normal. - Prove it. How's that for progress? Even my Chinese is coming back. And what those words mean? Well done. What does that mean? You've said it to me a thousand times. It means "I love you." If I say it in French, could we make a bargainl? Not yet. "I don't want to cheat on my husband with a man who isn't sure he is my husband. You're not scared of your loving husband, are you? - Georges! Is that you? Let go of me. Stop it. - I said it wasn't me. What are you going to do? Rape me? Great. I want to make love to my wife and that's rape. Well, that's the last straw. Georges, stop it. Damn it, if I can't even dream about my alcoholic past in Hong Kong, my geisha girls, my tigers, exotic pleasure in Kowloon my mansion beside the pond and the dragon fountain spouting water... That's right. - What's right? - The dragon fountain. That's real. You see, you remember. You should tell my wife. Did you hear the nice man, darling? - Isn't that proof enough for you? - Very good. You're a smart little boy. But you can do better. Shall I tell you the tragedy of my life? My wife is a saint, a nun, a statue. You can't have everything, I guess. Excuse my indiscretion but I can't help being a bit curious. Why do you want me to redecorate all the bedrooms? - My husband, Georges Campo. - Jean Debrosse, your decorator. How do you do? You've just returned from the colonies, have you not? Dear sir, France hasn't any colonies left. You're so right. What a pity too. - We were in Hong Kong. - I know. I asked your charming wife why you'd want to redecorate all the rooms of this magnificent château? We expect to have lots of guests, don't we George? Besides, we don't have any children yet. I'm disappointed. - But my wife... Now then, I would suggest something very simple. Beautiful, solid, country furniture. Period, of course. We'll cover the walls with cloth in solid colours, a different colour for each bedroom - a bright yellow, a warm orange, - a reddish... - Red, maybe. What a stunning piece. Curious, isn't it? I bought it in Hong Kong. My pipe collection. Opium, of course. Very rare. By next week I'll be able to present an estimate, Mr. Campo. - That's fine. - Naturally, it'll be as accurate as possible. Of course. And don't forget an operating room. - Operating room? - My friend is joking. I'm a doctor. And a friend of the family. So naturally we'll install a torture chamber. Do you smoke cigars, sir? I have here some excellent Havanas. Bought them in Hong Kong, by way of Mexico. - Good God. How awful. - You've had a close call, Mr. Campo! You bastard. Does it have the same measurements as my wife? - Yes sir. Very practical. - I can imagine. What time is it? Tell me in Chinese. Has Mr. Frédéric gone out? No, in French. Mr. Frédéric went into town. And my wife? She is resting, sir. - You rang, sir? Tell my wife and Mr. Frédéric I'm not eating tonight. I'm too tired, I don't want to be disturbed, by anyone. Mr. Frédéric will not return until tomorrow. That will save you from giving two messages. That's all. Nothing. Go. - The Master is in his room, Madame. I said I didn't want to be disturbed. - What's the matter, Georges? - Nothing. - Yes there is. - I said nothing. There is something. Tell me. Let me give you the latest news. Georges Campo is dead, buried, rotted. What are you saying? Rotted, do you hear? Stinking. Just rotten meat. Do you want to shake hands with a corpse? Do you want to say your last goodbye to Georges Campo? Come on. But what are you looking for Georges? My poor darling. You must have had a nightmare. You must get some sleep. You'll feel better tomorrow. - I'm going to sleep. That's enough, Kim. Georges, listen. Georges Campo is insane. You are insane. Georges, you are completely insane. Georges, you are going to kill yourself. You must kill yourself, now. Suicide. Better death than madness. Georges. Better death. You will get up, Georges. You will go to the window. You will leap into the void. Put an end to this hell. You will find peace. Peace. Definitely. Peace. Wake up. What is it? What are you doing here? - Weren't you asleep? - I was, but I woke up. - What do you want? - To make love to you. - We're alone now. Take it off. So it's him. So it was Freddie that killed your husband? - Three pistol shots. - When? Ten days before your accident. An accident that you two arranged? And you counted on my dying? But unfortunately I survived. That must have really messed up your plans. When you first came to, you spoke. But you couldn't remember anything. The doctor at the hospital warned me... you might have temporary amnesia. So we took advantage of it. And if anything went wrong, you figured your charms would save you. Was I wrong? No, you're pretty good. - You too. But go on. Who was your husband? We came back from Hong Kong. Nobody here knew him. He was brutal, violent and a drunk. Sounds like a great chap. Freddie was your lover, and they got in a fight? Frédéric killed him. And then he recruited you. He found you in a bar. You drank a lot. That's news. why me? How did I fit the set-up? You had just come back from Algeria, nobody knew you either. So once I had become Georges Campo... I'd kill myself or die in an accident... a nice innocent corpse. The dog, the trap door, the chandelier... The chandelier was Kim's idea. He hated you the first moment. So he's in on the deal too? And that decorator, how did he fit in? We needed a witness who had seen Georges Campo alive. The chandelier, the dog, the trap door, the decorator. But why the tape recorder? Frédéric had treated some soldiers in the war by hypnopedia. Hypnopedia? - You mean brainwashing? Your Freddie is a fine fellow too. What are you going to do with me now? Make love. If you want. - Is Madame up yet? - Madame is in the dining room, sir. Good morning, Georges. New haircut. How are you this morning? Bad. The political situation. - You're interested in politics now? Georges Campo is interested in everything now. Even in his wife. I said even in his wife. What's wrong, my dear? Aren't you glad that your loving husband has completely recovered his memory? Play a little pétanque later, Freddie? Yes, if you want to. I'll show you a stroke that puts some English on the ball. It's a trick I learned in Hong Kong from a British sergeant... called Lagrange. A friend of mine. Can you imagine, Freddie? I thought my wife here was a nun, a saint, a statue. I was wrong. While you were gone we had a terrific second honeymoon. Wasn't it, Christiane? There's a phone here, isn't there, Kim? Where is it? What are you going to do now? Call the police. That's what they're for. Hang up. Two down, one to go. - Are you going to kill me? - Don't move. What now? It's true that if you kill me you'll have a week's head start. Considering the amount of traffic in and out of this place. Can I have a cigarette? My name is Pierre Lagrange, isn't it? I thought so. You're nothing. A little thug, a drunken tramp of an ex-soldier. I was the one who planned everything, I killed my husband. I arranged your accident and made it look as if I'd been thrown clear. I thought of the trap door and the dog. When I saw the dog didn't kill you but dug up the corpse, I had Kim move it. Do you understand? You want to know something else? Kim is the only witness and I trust him. That's all very interesting. Stop. Stop or I'll shoot. Operator, would you please give me the police? I'm calling from the Château des Tours. Would you come right away, please? No, no. Two people have been killed. Yes. Well, it's difficult to explain over the phone. All right, all right, we won't touch anything. Nice work, Mrs. Campo. - Now what? - What are you going to do? Pierre Lagrange has plenty of time to think it over before the police get here. The men can do their work alone. Is there some place where we can talk? This way. Now, how did this double killing take place? There was a violent argument between our guest, Dr. Frédéric Launay and our houseman. He stabbed Doctor Launay and the doctor shot him. I see. - And now sir, may I ask... - Who I am? - I own this estate. - And your name? We found this in the bedroom upstairs. Georges. You are completely insane. You will kill yourself. You must kill yourself now. Suicide. Better death than madness. Better death...
