[moody electronic music] - I'm tellin' ya, that's what the guy said. Is this person a zombie? Hey, some of us would like to park this year! - [Woman] So, go on. So, who's the beneficiary, the wife or the girlfriend? - Who knows, they called me back an hour later and canceled the whole policy. Three weeks of hustlin' and the guy says to me, "I'm cancelin' the policy. "Life insurance is too much of a hassle. "Too many broads interested in my death." [ominous tones] - Man, that was so lame, he should've just stabbed his uncle while he had the chance. You just knew when they're asking for it! - All that jerkin', "to be or not to be." - A wuss like Hamlet doesn't deserve to live. - Excuse me. Excuse me. [students laugh] [tense music] - After you! - Jerk. - What? What, what? I wanna know what you said, what was it? - Get lost, punk. - No, really, I want to know. I have this keen interest in what people say to me. [dramatic music] What'd you say? - You're crazy, man! - He said somethin'. - I heard that. - Oh, the knife. - Oh, dude, hey. Watch out. - What did you say? - Nothing! - Remember me, Mr. Nothing. [students laugh] I think this is yours? [suspenseful music] Go. - See ya! [laughs] - Boom. - Dude. - Yeah. - [Friend] Where'd that come from, man? [laughs] - [Man] You are the best broker I know. Why are you on your own hustlin' like a dog? - What am I supposed to do, rob a bank? - So, are you still working? - No, Tom was afraid after the last two times, so. - You're out of the first trimester, you'll be fine now. - Time for you to start workin' for a company. - I just want anybody lookin' over my shoulder. - At my place, they're startin' guys off the street at 50, 60 base with commissions on top. - Wow. - Okay, I hear ya. - Hi, Mom, it's me. - Me who? - The only me in your life. - You got that right. What's going on? - Nothin' much. The play just got out. - What was it? - Hamlet, terrible. - [laughs] Jeffrey. - [Jeffrey] So we're just hangin' out, and I'm probably gonna go over to Mark's and study before I come home. - Okay, Virginia left dinner for you. I've got some work at court tomorrow, so I'll be late. I'll see you about, elevenish? - Okay. I love you. - Me, too. I'm not sure a change of venue's gonna help us here. - Let me set up an interview at my place for you. Our medical benefits are great. You don't want her givin' birth in a clinic. You come by, you take the qualifying test-- - Test? Come on! - You're exactly what they're lookin' for. You know the field better than half the management guys. - Alright, alright, I'll think about it. - [chuckles] That's Tom for "drop it." [moody electronic music] - Bingo. [car bleeps] And it's open. - Yes! - [Jeffrey] Start the clock. - License, registration, credit card receipts. - Keep. - Oh, a beauty! - Leave it out, can't unload those, they're all IDed. - We can make some calls. - Imbecile. - Got it. - Okay, how long? - 39 seconds. - Not bad. - [Friend] Come on, man, let's get outta here. - [Jeffrey] Not till 11, that's means you do, too. Oh, I like this, I like this. - Looks clear. - Let's do this. - Forget about it, man. - [Jeffrey] Be sure to set your alarm, mister. Three, two, we're in. [suspenseful music] - Hey, hey, hey, security's comin'! - [Jeffrey] So? Keep goin'. - Come on, let's go! Come on! Get out of the car, let's go! - Five seconds. - No, now! - Come on, let's go! Hurry up! - Come on, let's get outta here. - 10 seconds, time me. - Let's go! Let's go. Go, go. - Little weenies, you can't lose your nerve ever. When you're on the edge, that's when you dig in. - Look I'll stash the stuff and I'll meet you by your house. - See, I'm not saying he's wrong, just, I don't wanna punch a clock. - But everyone punches a clock. Look, you race around 100 miles here, 100 miles there. Three or four appointments a day. - You're tellin' me. - What? You know what I was thinkin'? You just love bein' on your own too much. You hate having to answer to other people, just hear me out. I just don't want you to feel like you have to take a corporate job for me. - When the baby comes, we're gonna need things. - Honey, we've got everything we need right here. Okay? Find a spot fast. - Hey, hon, get your keys out! You fumble around up there, you're a target! - We got company. - Hey, keep it cool. - Havin' a good time, pal? - Yes, sir. - You pullin' out? - No. - Then what are you doin'? - I'm not sure I have to answer that question. But I can see that you're a really concerned citizen. I'm just putting something away in my mother's car. I've just finished. I am now leaving. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ You got a problem with me ♪ ♪ You got a problem with me ♪ ♪ You got a problem with me ♪ ♪ You got a problem with me ♪ ♪ Well I've got a problem with you ♪ ♪ You got a problem with me ♪ ♪ Well I've got a problem with you ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Got a problem, oh, yeah ♪ [suspenseful music] - Hi, my name is Tom Casey, I live at 60 Carlton Place. I was just out parkin' my car, and I ran into a group of kids, that really looked like they were cruisin' for some trouble. Yeah, no kidding, my car got broken into last month. I was just wonderin' if you might send a car by or somethin' and have a look at it. Oh, that'd be great, thank you very much. [moody rock music] [students laugh] - Oh, the vehicle of a concerned citizen. We're givin' him his commendation. - Registration. - Give me. - [Friend] Whoa. Is it loaded? - Yep. - [Officer] Drop it! Release! Put your hands where I can see 'em and get outta the car! - Lady, just fill out the form and sign at the bottom. - Be cool, my mother's a lawyer, she'll take care of it. The first time we've ever tried anything like this. As juveniles. It's our first offense, you'll be fine. Don't wimp out. - Let's go. What're you lookin' at them for? They got you into this. - Get up. Now, come on! - Your son is more serious. He was in possession of a loaded weapon. - Officer, that's not possession, the boy found the weapon in the car, picked it up and was arrested. Transitory control isn't possession. You've got possible attempt, possible mischief, okay? - And you've got a problem, lady, I wouldn't be so cool, if my kid were arrested for stealing a car radio. - Stealing? There's no evidence of anything having been taken from that vehicle. - [chuckles] Alright. It's not my problem, you deal with family court. - Thank you, officer. I may not look it, it's not my style... I'm about as upset as I've ever been. I don't believe it. Why? - I don't know. - That won't fly, Jeffrey. - I mean it, I don't know why I did it, I just did. I thought it would be a kick. - Was it? [clock buzzes] - Where you going? - [sighs] They're cleanin' the street. I've gotta move the car. - Mm, give me a kiss. - Go back to sleep. - Hurry back. Okay? [ominous music] - God! God! - Did you find a spot? What? - They hit us again. They ripped up the whole car and they stole the cassette. - Alright, don't get nuts, did you call the police? - [chuckles] They left me a note, telling me what I already know. - Why don't we just put the car in a garage already? - [chuckles] A garage. You know, why didn't I think of that? In a garage, which one? The one up the street where they want $385 a month, while I'm bustin' my chops to pay the rent here? - The car runs, doesn't it? - Yeah, it runs. - So, just don't replace the cassette player. - I have to replace it, the car is trashed, alright? I can't drive a client around like that. I'm sorry. - So, what are you gonna do? - I'll take it to Mac. And see what it'll cost to repair it. [knocks] Yeah, hi, this is 237, do you have anything for me? Yeah. Well, no, it's the first time hearing about it. I drove all the way out here for nothin'. I know. Okay. Alright, thanks. [phone keypad bleeps] [phone rings] - Hi. - Hey, you called? - What's up with you? [Tom chuckles] - [Tom] My car got hit again. - Get out. - You should see the number they did on it. - Are you insured? - Not for that. They canceled me after last time. I've got collision, it's all I could afford. So, then I drive 40 miles to sell an annuity. Turns out they're on vacation, nobody told me. - I'm tellin' ya. It's time for you stop knockin' your brains out. I set up an appointment for you to take the company exam next week. I knew you wouldn't do it. You dead or what? - No, no, I'm here. - Look, you take the test, and when they offer you the job, you decide. - Had another day like today, it'd look pretty good. - It is good, I've got a couple openings in my department in a month or so, I can get you in there. - Alright, alright, Jesus, you nag like my mother. Honey? [suspenseful music] - Tom. These officers are here to see you. - Mr. Casey, your car was broken into last night? - Yeah, you're tellin' me. - Well, we caught the kids that did it. - You're kiddin'? [chuckles] That's a first. Yeah, 'cause you know, I made a call. There was just like a gang of kids hangin' around the car. - Mr. Casey, we've got a problem, one of the kids was arrested with a loaded .38 caliber Smith & Wesson. Said he found it under the front seat of your car. When we ran it, it was registered to you. - Geez, I forgot all about that thing. - I thought you got rid of it? - I did. Sort of. You see, we were held up about a block from here, and the guy had a gun, so I got a little crazed, and I went upstate and I bought that .38 and I brought it home and, well, she got a little bit upset with me. - I hate guns. - What was it doing in the car? - She wouldn't let me keep it in the house, [chuckles] so I put it in the car. To tell you truth, I had completely forgotten about it, until just now. - I'm sure that's true, Mr. Casey, but having a concealed loaded weapon in your car is a felony. - [chuckles] Come on. - Mr. Casey, we need you to come down to the station. - Wait a minute, I'm not under arrest, am I? - That's about it. - These little punks break into my car, tear it up, and I get arrested? They get a slap on the wrist, I've gotta get a lawyer? - [Friend] Little bastards, I'd like to break their faces. - And then some, and the lawyer I go to see, wants five grand just to say "not guilty." 2,500 a word, you work your way up. - Lawyers are scum. Look, what about your brother-in-law, Manny? He would do it, wouldn't he? - Oh, yeah, everybody would love that. The bum that Sally married gets arrested and the good son-in-law has to bail him out. - If the price is right. - You know what kind of a mouth her sister's got. - You need representation. - Not from them. I don't want their nose into my business. Can you believe that all of this has come down because of those little... So, is your brother gonna get me their names or what? - Let me give him a call. [dark atmospheric music] - [Jeffrey] That bastard called the cops. That's how we were nailed. - Who cares how? We were! - [Jeffrey] You two are making me sick. So you were arrested, big deal, those are the breaks. If you can't take the heat, don't hang with the man. - Well, we've both got records now. - What records, Fats, you wuss? You been listenin' to your father? He's a CPA, for cryin' out loud. Do you trust me? Have I ever conned you? Have I? I have researched this, here's what'll happen. The only charge that'll stick is attempt. We are underage, so the family court, not the criminal court, has jurisdiction. - So, what? - So, the family court guys are weenies. You look scared, guilty, remorseful, you may have to cry. After that, they pass sentence. Which, even if you're represented by a staggering drunk, we'll be suspended, or probation, that is it. But here's the good part. This is the state penal code. We get off, but the guy who left a loaded gun in the car, Mr. Concerned Citizen who called the police on us? He is guilty of a felony. [dark atmospheric music] Hm? - So, the hearing's in two weeks, and Tom is crazed. - You wanna tell me what's wrong with your husband? He buys a gun and keeps it loaded in his car? - Manny, stop it, she feels lousy enough. You keep coloring, big ears. - I wouldn't let him keep the gun in the house. - Alright, maybe we can get the whole thing knocked down to a misdemeanor. Take the position that his car is his place of business. Let me talk to him. - He's not home, he's visiting with a friend of his. - Alright, have him call me when he gets in, huh? He doesn't know you're calling, does he, Sally? - Um, Manny, I just-- - Look. I'm not gonna handle this if Tom doesn't want me. - No, no, no, it's not that, it's just, you know Tom, he's embarrassed in front of family that he got in trouble and... Look, I'll call you back, Manny, okay? I really appreciate it, so does Tom. - Okay, don't get aggravated. It'll work out. [melancholic music] - Their records are sealed. [chuckles] The juveniles, they protect them like the queen's jewels. I don't know how Jim's brother's got the stuff. - What did you want their names and addresses for? - I wanted to know where they were from. What kind of families. - Who cares? [Tom sighs] [moody orchestral music] - Mark! You and your friends like breakin' into cars. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - I think we should talk about this. - Don't even know who you are. - You don't know who I am? I'm the guy whose car you tore up. - Man, you're nuts! - No, I'm just a little upset. Now I want you to tell me which one of your friends took my gun. Was it you? Was it that tall, skinny one, the one that they call Fats? Or was it Jeffrey? Alright, I'm gonna give you till the count of three before I get angry. One. - Nobody took the damn gun! - Two! - Jeff found it, okay? But, he... [sobs] - It's okay. It's okay. That's what I wanted, that's all I wanted. I've got a message for your friend Jeffrey. You tell him that I know where he lives, so don't let me catch him out on the street lookin' for trouble. He's gonna find it. I'm watchin' him. [moody rock music] - The swine declared war! - He's crazy, the guy is nuts! - You should've seen the guy's face, man. - Now we're gonna go for it. - Oh, no, no, no. I don't want any more of this. - Yeah, me neither. - This is very interesting! A man makes a wimp out of my friend, and I'm the only one who wants to avenge it? You wanna sit around and let this porker scum get away with roughing up your friend? - No, we just don't wanna get into any more trouble. - Duh! I could break your arm. Just a little downward pressure. Snap. But, I always know when to stop, just short of the snap. Now, as long as you're with me, we'll always, always stop just short, of the snap. Now, we know the porker's name, we know where he lives. It's on his registration. Let's take him to the snap. [moody electronic music] His telephone number, bills, credit card number. Ever hear a pig squeal? This porker is ours. - Your estate is in excess of 600 thou. So, if something were to happen to you, you don't want your family to have to sell assets. I've got this. You see, this policy would ensure that they have the cash to take care of the taxes. - Yeah, I see. What's this gonna run? - Let me run some scenarios by you. [phone rings] [suspenseful music] [phone rings] - Hello? - [Robotic Voice] Welcome to Time Tracer. We watch your time so you don't have to. - What? Who is this? - [Robotic Voice] Do you know how much time you have? [kids laugh] - I'm sorry, sir, your card's been refused. - That's impossible, you'll have to rerun it or something. - I did, sir, they said it's been reported stolen. You know, sometimes these things happen, but I'm afraid it's our policy, I have to keep the card. - It's my card, okay? See this? It's the same name, this is my drivers license, so, give me my card back. There's obviously been some sort of an error. - Sir, I'm sure there has but I still have to keep the card. Would you like to try another card? - No, it's the only card that I have, so uh, do you know what? I'll pay cash. It always happens like this, when you don't have enough money on you. Would you take a personal check? - [Waiter] I'm sorry, sir, we don't take checks here. - Come on, let me. Here. - Thank you, sir. - I'll write you a check. - Forget it. I'm sure it was just a computer error. [dark electronic music] - [Robotic Voice] This little porky goes to market. This little porky stays home, all alone. Time Tracer says your time's running out, Sally. - Will you stop this, whoever you are! I'm calling the police. [kids laugh] - Did you hear her voice, how hysterical she is? Now, what happens next is, old Tom, he's gonna get crazy. He's gonna run to the cops. This is primo, this is primo. The cops are gonna tell him to change his number, get new locks and flip him off. What we do next, we need to get a little closer, a little reconnaissance. [Sally sobs] - The credit card "thing" was not a coincidence. You see, they call my house every 10 minutes. All day and all night. My wife is pregnant and it is scaring the life out of her. - Mr. Casey, you have no proof that those kids did it. So it's really not a good idea to go around making accusations. Everybody in the city gets crank calls. Change your number, it'll stop. - No, no, I can't change my number. I use that phone for my business, it is on my cards, it is on my stationary. Do you have any idea the cost it would be to replace that? What if those kids break into my apartment? - That's not the pattern. They get their kicks out of scaring people. Hearing your reaction. If you're nervous, change your locks. [Tom chuckles] - Change my locks, another 50 bucks. Great. - Thank you, officer. - "Thank you, officer," for what? What did she do? - Look, there's a murder every three minutes in the city. I guess crank calls aren't a priority. - You know, it makes me sick. You run a red light and they're all over you. - Listen, I'm gonna walk and get some stuff at the cleaners. We have to be at Angie's by three, so why don't you pick me up at 2:15, just honk and I'll come down, okay? - Come on, I'll give you a lift, I don't want you walkin'. - No, Tom, it's three blocks, I'm supposed to walk anyway. 2:15, honk, okay? [knocks] - Yeah? - [Man] CAE Locks? Mr. Casey ordered your locks changed? - He didn't say anything about it to me. - [Man] I don't know, I have the order here. Your husband called my dad, and my dad sent me over to do the job right away. Hi, um... If you rather I came back another time, I can. - Well, my husband didn't mention it. He's on the road today, I don't think I can reach him. - Oh, that's okay, I can come back another time, after you've checked with your husband. - You're here, you might as well. - I don't need to come in, I can do it all from here. - Okay. - When he called, your husband said you'd been having some problems. It's probably a good idea for you to do it. This will only take a few minutes. Don't let me keep you from what you were doing. - No, I was just cleaning the closet. [suspenseful music] - Got any power around? - Oh, uh, over there. - It's a good thing you and your husband decided to get rid of this lock. - Why? It's no good? - It's okay, but the one I got's better. My dad says, "if a pro wants in, he's gonna get in, "no matter what you have." - That's comforting. - Well, the one I got's gonna slow him up a bit. Noise drivin' you crazy? - Nope! Yes, but what can you do? - Almost finished with the drilling. [drill whines] You, uh... You say your husband's on the road, he a salesman? I'm sorry. My dad says I talk too much. - No, it's okay. No, he's in insurance. But he's always home at night. - He keep a car in town? - Yeah. - That must be a pain. [Sally chuckles] - It is, yeah. [ominous tones] - Done. You wanna try these? - [Sally] Oh, uh, they're fine. [horn honks] - Oh, uh, oh, it's my husband. How much do I owe you? - The call's 58, lock 29, keys 2.50. It's 89.50 plus tax is 97.10. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Oh, and ma'am, you were right to be so cautious. You have any trouble, you give us a call. The number's on the receipt. [ominous tones] - [Angie] Once the baby comes, you're not gonna wanna live in the city. - But I love the city. - You drag a carriage up and down those curbs for a week, and then you call me. - It's awfully quiet in there. - That's a good sign. Relax, at least they're not killing each other. - Well, I think we're gonna be fine. - You do? - Yeah. They're not lookin' for guys like him. - Oh, god, I'm so relieved. Are you sure we're gonna be okay? - Yeah, go home, relax, it's old news. - Thank you, Manny. - Hey, sweetie, take care, honey. - Thank you. [dark electronic music] Hey, what happened? - I can't get in, it's the new lock, the keys don't work. - What new lock? - [Sally] Oh, the lock people you called came today. - I didn't call any lock people. - No, this guy came with an order from you. He said you ordered the locks changed. - Some guy came here, who? - I don't know, some kid. - Kid? What did he look like? - I don't remember. He was tall, he was dark, he was the owner's son. He knew what he was doing, Tom. - Any idiot can put in a lock. - Well, he said if we had any problem, we should call him. I've got the number on the receipt. - What was the name of this company? - I don't remember, just some initials. CB or BB Locksmith. Where are you going? - To call a locksmith. - [Jeffrey] Of course he's going to change his locks. - [Fats] So, what was the point? - Fats, I really worry about you. I was this close, this close to the porker's wife. I want him to know it was us, that's the fun. He knows it's us and he can't do a thing about it. - 185 bucks for a lock I didn't need changed. - The keys worked when I left. - Well, he rekeyed it, [chuckles] this kid's got some nerve. - Well, how would he do it? - He's needling me! He's gettin' in any way he can. - I let him in. He had an order from you, he used your name. He was in our house. Oh, god. Tom. God. [classical piano music] - How's the trial going? - The usual. He did, he didn't, they're both lying. [chuckles] Jeffrey, did you cut study hall this week? I got a call from the school. - Yeah. It's just so boring sitting there like a geek. I study at night, I know the stuff. - Well, that's not the point, is it? You're supposed to be in study hall, that's where you are. - Yeah. You're right. [mother chuckles] - Mr. Casey. - [Tom] Mrs. Bateman, thank you for seeing me so quickly. - You sounded so upset on the phone. - [Tom] I am. - Do you wanna tell me about it? - Yeah. About 10 days ago, I was arrested for criminal possession of a firearm. I go to court at the end of the week. The gun was under the front seat of my car, when some kids broke into it. Now, the kids that did it have gotten my telephone number, my credit card number, and my address. They are making threatening calls, they have canceled my credit card, they have even changed the locks on my door. - How do you know it was those kids? - I know. - Why did you come to see me, Mr. Casey? - I thought you could do something about it, you see, my privacy is being invaded and I want it stopped. And if it isn't stopped one way, I will stop it another. - I detect a threat. - I'm just giving information. Now, maybe you could do something about this, before I have to? That is what lawyers are for, right, ma'am? - I have some pro bono legal advice for you, Mr. Casey. Whatever you have in mind, don't. Jeffrey, he threatened me. - Mom, I swear to god. I don't know what this guy's talking about. He's crazy. - Look, you've never lied to me that I know of, but things are going on with you that I don't like. - I know, I know. I feel like because of that one thing that happened, you're never gonna believe anything I say. I don't know what else to do. - Alright. I wanna believe you, so I'm only going to say this once. If it's not you doing these things, you can ignore it. But if it is, I'm warning you, stop it. Everything you do has consequences. There's a reaction to it, it escalates. Now, you stay away from this man. He's very angry and angry people do dangerous things. - We don't deny the possession, but your honor, his car is his place of business. He spends over 75% of his work week on the road, frequently at night, often in bad neighborhoods. The gun was bought for his protection, that of his family and his clients. He's never used it, no one was hurt, as far-- - Mr. Baylis, let me cut through this, by your reasoning, any citizen who rides to work in his own car, in a bad neighborhood, can arm his vehicle, and if he's caught, hope it's only a misdemeanor. But this law is designed to keep firearms out of the hands of felons. - Stand. [suspenseful music] - Court finds the defendant guilty of a class D felony. - You honor, my client-- - No, Mr. Baylis. That's it, I'm sentencing him to 15 days in the custody of the Department of Corrections at Riverhead. - Approach the bench? - Yes. - [Man] This is a final order of the court. You have 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal. Should you choose not to appeal, you will surrender yourself at the appointed time and date to the Men's Correctional Institute. There to be transported to Riverhead Correctional. - [Judge] Three days to order your affairs. [melancholic music] - Manny says it's risky. I could file for the appeal, and if I lose, I could do a full year. [chuckles] I'll just do the 15 days. I'll get it over with. - I don't know. - Oh, what a time to leave you. - I'll be okay. I love you. [phone rings] No, just let it ring. [phone rings] [phone rings] Let it go. - I can't. - Please, please let it go. [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] [lively rock music] [phone rings] [phone rings] [phone rings] ♪ Crash and burn, that's what I want ♪ ♪ Straight into a tall rock mountainside ♪ [phone rings] ♪ Oh, in my head really stringed up ♪ ♪ Say I did it just for the ride ♪ [melancholic electronic music] - Hey. What do you wanna see this for? [dark electronic music] - [Officer] Come on. Okay, let's go. - [Bateman] We're off the record here? We're prepared to cooperate to the fullest, but I don't want anything we say here used against Jeffrey for any purpose, trial or disposition. - Agreed. - [Bateman] What concerns me the most is the possession. - It should. - We don't want a weapons charge on his record. It would ruin his life. The kid found a gun, picked it up and held it for a second, before he was arrested. At best, you have temporary innocent possession. - The question is intent. Whether the kid's gonna take the gun. - Well, that's the people's burden. You won't be able to show that. Come on, the kids were out for the thrill of the escapade. They found a gun, Jeffrey was holding it in both hands, looking at it, he made no attempt to secrete it, didn't pocket it, he was just looking at it, like any child seeing a real gun for the first time. The police report confirms that. - Alright, if I dump possession, we're left with-- - Thank you. - I said "if." We're left with attempted grand larceny, and criminal mischief. [sighs] Let me talk to him. [suspenseful music] Hello, Jeffrey, come on in. Have a seat. Now, Jeffrey, I'm sure your mother's made you aware of the seriousness of the charges. - She didn't have to, I know what I did. I knew it while I was doing it, I wanted to stop. It wasn't the kick we thought it would be. - Jeffrey's prepared to make any reparations for damages out of his college bank account. - It's not just the money. It's what I did to that man. - What was that, Jeffrey? - I found out he's a traveling salesman, and he needs his car for work. [dark orchestral music] What I did to it... I cost him and his family a lot more than money. - Jeffrey, this is your first offense, and your record's good. You've shown recognition of how serious your crime was, and its impact on the victim. So, I'm gonna drop the weapon charges and recommend that the others be reduced to attempted petty larceny. Reparations will be made and I'll further recommend a suspended sentence. - Thank you. [moody electronic music] [Tom coughs] [phone rings] [suspenseful music] [phone rings] [phone rings] - Hello. - [Robotic Voice] Time Tracer was noticing how fat you are getting. - Police are tapping this line. - [Robotic Voice] You must have a piglet in there. Oink, oink. - Shut up, you maniac. [phone keypad bleeps] [phone rings] - She's out, we're in. [dark orchestral music] - Jeffrey? Honey? Jeffrey? [ominous tones] - [Robotic Voice] Welcome to Time Tracer. We watch your time so you don't have to. [Bateman chuckles] [lively rock music and chatter] - Every time anyone looks at me sideways, I start crying. - Yeah? Hey, Scotty, don't do that, please! It's gonna be over soon. - I suppose. I just feel bad complaining when it's Tom who's-- - In the slammer? - [chuckles] Don't hold back, Ang. [sobs] - Hey, I can't stand to see you this way. - No, it's just because-- - I know, I know, Tom's away. But that's not what I think. This is a very sensitive time for you, for any woman. And don't tell me it doesn't upset you when he acts a certain way. - What way? - He yells. He yells at every little thing. - Well, look at what he's going through. - He's always yelled. - Tom is the most decent, loving, there is nothing in the world that he wouldn't do for me. You know, you just have to know how to handle him. You wouldn't understand because everything with you is a frontal assault. - Nobody yells at me. - Yeah, who could get a word in? - Okay, fine, don't take my advice. - I didn't hear any advice. - My advice is, you better know when enough is too much. [dark electronic music] [lively background chatter] [door creaks] [suspenseful music] [peaceful piano melody] [dark electronic music] [lively background chatter] [lively classical piano music] - Oh, I saw Jim and Carol, they send their love. Carol's pregnant again. - Oh, good. How's my baby, both of 'em? - [Sally] Oh, I'm doing fine, getting fatter. - I talked to some guy, he told me I wouldn't be in here, if I had a decent lawyer. - I know, you told me. What's the point of going over it, though, you know? We didn't know. - Yeah. Okay, I've gotta go, there's a line here, so, um, don't you worry about anything and I'll call you, as soon as I can. - I love you. - You, too. - [Inmate] So, tell me, who's your wife sleepin' with while you're here in the slammer? [dramatic music] [thuds and grunts] - [Guard] Get over there. Sit down, everybody. [somber electronic music] - It's over. So, I don't know how Angie and Manny stand it. I mean, Scott running around the house yelling, the baby crying for hours on end, the noise level. - You should try livin' with 70 cons. Hey, hey. I'll get that. This is all just gonna take some time. [dark electronic music] - You're sure no one has the key? I don't know, the maid, an ex-employee doing a number? - It was those kids! - Kids break locks, Mr. Casey, they take things. There's no sign of a break-in, you say nothing's missing. - These aren't ordinary kids, they know all about locks. They did this. - We can try to talk to the kids, Mr. Casey. - We can only talk with them in the presence of their parents. And then we can only get what they're willing to volunteer. - They're juveniles, their rights are heavily-- - What about our rights? - We understand what you're going through, Mr. Casey, but there's no proof that these kids are involved in any way. - We'll be in touch. You have our number in case anything comes up. - Why didn't get rid of the gun? Shh? Who's here? - They don't need to hear us talkin' about the gun. - None of this would've happened if you'd gotten rid of it. You told me you did. - Don't you think I've paid enough for that? - The guy is nuts! I don't believe this. What does he want? - You've never been to his apartment? - Never, I don't even know where he lives! The guy has this vendetta against us. He even threatened my mother. - He came to my office and threatened the boys and me. We can understand his anger and we're prepared to make reparations for any damages to his car, but, I won't allow him to make these kinds of accusations. - I am afraid of the guy. I didn't tell you this, but he attacked my friend Mark on the street. He dragged Mark into an alley and he threatened him, and he beat his head against a brick wall. I saw it, you can ask Mark. - Why didn't you report the incident? - I don't know. Mark was afraid of the guy. I guess we just wanted to forget the whole mess. - I'm becoming very concerned about this man. - [Detective] The mother says you threatened her at her office. One of the boys says you roughed him up, and the other boy confirms it. - Look, I wanted the mother to get her kid to stop harassing us. - So you roughed up the other boy? - I didn't! I tried to scare him. - Mr. Casey, the boy's parents are not pressing charges this time, but I suggest you stay far away from those kids, and their families. That's a warning. [door slams] [Tom sighs] - You roughed up that kid? You threatened that mother? - I didn't, I-- - Yes! I know you when you're angry. That's why you wanted those addresses. You just had to push it, you just can't back down. And I keep making excuses for you. - Are you blaming me for this? - Yes, I am. This could've happened to anybody, and they'd just walk away from it. You know, stuff happens, but not you. You just have to keep pushing. I can't stand what you're doing to us. - Okay. Okay, it's alright. - No, it's not alright! You have gotta let this go. Promise me you'll let it go. - I can't let this go. - Well, if you can't, then I'm not staying. [moody electronic music] [phone rings] - Yes! - Hi, what's the matter? - [Tom] Hi, nothing, I just, what's going on? - Look, we've known each too long, so I'm not gonna dance around this. My supervisor called me in yesterday, you passed the test and everything was fine until they ran a check. That felony thing came up, I tried to explain what it was and they were very understanding, but the company deals with a lot of government contracts and their policy's not to hire anybody with a criminal record. - Yeah. - [Jim] Geez, Tom, I feel lousy about it. - It's alright. - I talked till I was blue! - I know, I know. You did the best you could. - [Jim] Look, something's gonna come up. I'll keep my ears open. - Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna have to go. Oh, my god! - Tom? - Oh, my god. - [Jim] Tom. Tom, are you alright? [suspenseful electronic music] [knocks] - [Tom] Echo sent me. - Oh, yeah? That's real interesting. Echo's away. - [Tom] So was I. Riverhead, I just got out. - What do you want? - I wanna do some business. - What? - [Tom] Nine millimeter. - You got five bills? - It is so fine, the cops are juiced. They think he's been going after us, now we finish it. Has anyone got a problem? - Yeah, me and Mark, we're out. - Okay? - I mean, we just wanna drop it, we've done enough, right? We had some kicks. - Okay. [suspenseful music] - What're you doin'? - I'm callin' old Tom. Tell him the whole thing's off. - What are you, crazy? - No, I think you're right. I think we've gotta come clean to clear our conscience, and tell him all the things we've been doing, you know, the phone calls, credit cards, changing the locks. - Quit it. - He's not gonna do anything. - I really think I have to. I've been thinking about all those stereos, too. Those ones that are stowed at your house? And then I have to admit that I didn't see him do anything to you in the alley, I was lying the way you told me to. But the toughest part is going to be telling him about the cradle, the way you two left it in his bathroom, after you trashed his place. - He's not gonna believe that crap, he knows it was you. - I don't think so. What if the police check the fingerprints on the cradle? They're yours, both of you touched them, after I wiped it clean. - Uh-uh, no, we didn't. - Are you sure? Are you sure? Are you sure? You're not? You were holding it and he put the pig in. I mean, you better be real sure before you want out. So? What do ya say? What? - I'm in. - Yeah. - Perfect. Hey, oink oink. [suspenseful music] - [Tom] I don't know what's happenin' to me. I don't know what I'm doing. - That's the problem. Don't do anything, back off. Look I don't blame you, this whole thing's been a nightmare. But it's not about right and wrong anymore, it's survival. And you've gotta focus on what's right. Sally, you and the baby, that's where it is. - I bought a gun. - Geez, Tom. - I know. I don't know what else to do. - What you do is you get rid of it now, man. Then you go home, you get Sally, and you go look for a new apartment. Get away from this mess and start clean. - Yeah. Yeah. [dramatic music] [Sally screams] - Shh, let's go! - Go, go, go! [Sally screams] Come on, come on! [suspenseful music] - Honey? Honey? [phone rings] Hello. - [Robotic Voice] If you want to find the treasure, follow the clues. - If you touch her, I'll kill you. - [Robotic Voice] You'll get the first clue from the phone booth at the corner of 20th street and 10th avenue at exactly 5PM. [dramatic electronic music] [Tom pants] - You makin' a call or what? - I'm waiting for one. [man speaks foreign language] [phone rings] - [Robotic Voice] The men's room at the Penthouse Bar. Be there at six sharp or the clue will be gone. [moody rock music] [moody electronic music] - Give him 20 minutes. [suspenseful music] [knocks] - Alright, just leave it outside the door. - [Man] No, I need a signature. - I don't understand why they didn't sign for it downstairs. - Where's Jeffrey? - I want you out of here. - Where is he? - What do you want from us? - I want my wife! He's got my wife! - Mr. Casey, that's not true. - Shut up! You have no idea what is going on here, who your son is. - Mr. Casey-- - I know it's him! He uses a computer voice, but I know who it is. [ominous tones] She's pregnant. - [Detective] Mr. Casey, your wife's only been gone a few hours. - Oh, please. She didn't leave her underwear on the bed with a knife sticking in it! - Dan will check on that when I take you downtown. - He knows where she is. - I don't! I wish I could help you. Look, maybe she just went shopping. There's sales all over town. She'll probably just come home loaded with packages. - You shut your mouth! - He's crazy, he's crazy! Your wife probably never even left the building. - [Detective] Let's go. [horn honks] [dramatic music] Suspect's on the ground, heading east! - We should have cuffed him, okay, stay on him. He bolted, you stay put! - Where are you going? - Maybe I can help. - You're not going near that man. - He's heading to his house, it's just through the alley. - What do you mean? - I've gotta see this. - Jeffrey, what's going on? [suspenseful music] - [Robotic Voice] If you want to find the treasure, follow the clues. You'll get the first clue from the phone booth at the corner of 20th street and 10th avenue at exactly 5PM. The men's room at the Penthouse Bar, be there at... [dramatic music] - Sally! Sally! [distant sirens wail] - Secure the building, now! - We've got an incident here. Perp's somewhere in the building. I want everybody cleared out of the first and second floor. - [Officer] Clear across the street. Make sure those people stay back. - I want everybody out of this area, now! - Who do we have? - Male Caucasian, thirties. Got a record for firearm possession, he's unbalanced, and may have weapons in the building we don't know of. I'm gonna try and talk him out. Mr. Casey, Tom, this is Lieutenant McKnight. Tom Casey, I need to talk to ya. [dramatic music] [Tom groans] [sirens wail] [helicopter blades whir] - Anything you can tell us about the building? - There's a hallway that goes straight through to the back door. All the buildings that were built at that time had the same floor plan. [suspenseful music] - Get an ambulance! - Help her. Is she gonna be okay? - She's in shock. She'll be alright. - She was in a closet in the basement! - Gee, Mr. Casey. I am sorry I didn't believe you about your wife. - You bastard, I'll kill you! [dramatic music] I know what you did! - No! He's my son! - Get back, get back! - Be cool, Tom. - Back! - Be cool. - Go back, go back. - Just get back! - Don't kill me! [suspenseful music] - Hey, Tom. Are you gonna shoot me in front of all these cops? - That depends on you, Jeffrey, get over here! [siren wails] [suspenseful music] - Please, isn't there something you can do? Jeffrey! Oh, my god. - [SWAT] Alright, team number one to the left. Team number two to the right. Move, move, move! Holding their position. - Hey. - Alright, we can see him, has he got anyone else? - No, just the kid. There's a rear entrance, but this guy could go. I wouldn't surprise him. Tom? Tom, the ambulance is here. So, your wife's gonna be alright. Now, I know you'd like to go with her. So, why don't you just put the gun down and let the kid go? Okay? - Hey, Tom, you wanna be with your wife. Look what she's been through. - Let the ambulance go, get her to the hospital, now! - [Officer] Come on, clear the way, let's go. - Alright. [suspenseful music] Me and you. You looked me right in the eye and you told me she probably never even left the building. You knew she was here. I wanna hear you say it was you. - [Detective] This was in Sally's hand. - Is this Jeffrey's jacket? - Yes. [suspenseful music] - Tom, I think you're an obsessive-compulsive. You keep insisting that I've done all these things. But you don't have any proof. - That's the thing about a gun, you don't need any proof! - Tom? Tom, you see what I have here? This is Jeffrey's jacket. A torn piece of it was in your wife's hand. We got him, Tom. - That's not mine! - I saw you take it off. - I was wearing it, but it's not mine. You see, Tom, here's how it works. I could say to you right now, I did it. How are you going to prove it? - Jeffrey! Tell him the truth. - See, they can't even talk to me without my lawyer. - Then I don't know how else to stop you. - Oh, god. Please! Mr. Casey. I believe you. But, please. He's only a child. - Tom! Don't. It's for nothing! You're gonna ruin your life for nothin'. - Please! - Tom, we got him, I swear to you! - No, he'll get off! - No, he won't! He won't. I hope you never have to say this about your child, but he won't get off. - [Robotic Voice] From the phone booth at the corner of 20th street and 10th avenue at exactly 5PM. The men's room at the Penthouse Bar. Be there at six sharp or the clue will be gone. [suspenseful music] - Come on, come on, come on. - Tom! [ominous tones] One last round. [glass smashes] - Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey? Somebody, he needs help! It's alright, I'm here. Hey. Jeffrey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Give me the gun, Tom. Give it to me. Your wife and baby are fine, she's at Mercy. We'll drive you. - I'll walk. [moody electronic music] [sirens wail] [moody electronic music]
