Stand still. Don't run. Don't run. Stand still. Stand still. Stand still. Don't move. Freeze. What's the situation up there? There are 8 to 9 people there. Okay, let's go. Be quick I am doing now. Make it a little more loose. Yesterday you made it too tight. Sure, you'll like it. Don't just compliment yourself. How was that Japanese yesterday? Totally disappointing! Exhausted after a few tries. But I earned 1,000 dollars. Oh, good of you to earn that much. You'll be rich if you got 5 or 6 clients. If you want money, you do it I wish I can do that. Hey, Angie. With such expensive ring you came for a hair wash? It could be stolen. No big deal I have a dozen more at home. This is the cheapest of all. It just costs 20,000. No big deal even if it's robbed. Damn bitches bluffing again. Mister, I would like to have a... John Travolta's hairstyle Toyota? 1,600cc or 2,000cc. What are you talking about? I am not talking about cars. That one. The dancer in 'Grease' Oh, King of Grease Travolta. Don't speak English if your English is bad. Hair-wash, sir? Yes I want to go to the toilet. That way. Please follow me. Oh, your friend is weird. All customers like to lay back while washing hair. But you like to sit instead. Like it better this way? We are used to it. Hey. Guys, what's with you? Don't stop. Wash quick. Faster. Freeze. This is a stick-up. Freeze. This is a robbery. Don't move. Go over there. Quick. Stand still. Take out all your belongings or else I'll stab you. Quay“- You! Be quick. Quick. Hear me? Quick! Pick it up. Pick it up. You... What are you mumbling? And you! The ring! What's wrong with your hand? I can't get it out now. Hold out your hand. What for? Chop it off I'll pull it out. And the watch. Bend down and wash. Bend down. You finished yet? Done. Let's go then. Buddy, you forgot something. Police. Freeze. Don't shoot. My gun is fake. Freeze. Drop on the ground. Lady, call the police. Don't run. I'm a cop. Where are you going? Why are you catching me? I'm innocent. Shut up. Get up. What are you running for? I thought he's going to rob me. Why can't I run? Don't talk bullshit. Old-timer, check the suitcase. Nothing. It's empty inside. Hey, you got no evidence and nothing there. What're you paying me for the arrest? Whatever you like, okay I'll take you to police station, okay? Sergeant. You check downstairs. I'll take him back. Okay. Move. Damn kid plays the 'informer' You dare to be an informer! Baldie, what are you doing here? Stealing car, huh? Get lost. Or I'll call the cops. Inspector, what're you charging me with? If there isn't any charge I rather get going. Fine I will arrest you for obstruction of justice. You can go when your lawyer bails you out. Sir. It's not easy to get him back. You just let him go? What do you want? Keep me for dinner? Sergeant. You're not that great to keep me in. You said I'm not qualified. Careful, it's slippery here. Sergeant, help him up. Thank you, sir. Inspector lam lawyer Chui Tian Yung lam here to bail Chen Jin San. Bail? Who said you can bail him? Don't try to discuss law with me I know the law better than you I know you have no evidence to make substantial charge on my client. So I can bail him out. Evidence? I can get it any time. Sergeant, shut up. Actually I can indict you first I'll sue you for beating up my client and for being impolite to my litigant. Disrespectful? Respectful to someone like him? And you. Lawyers are supposed to be good. But one like yourself would do more harm than good. Hey, stop it. Or I'll sue you for slander. Okay, Lawyer Chui. You can proceed with bail... in the report room. This way. Thank you, Inspector I'll go first, sergeant. Try your best to get the evidence. Damn rogue! Sergeant. Take it easy. We have planned for a long time. We'd had got him long before now. But we'll use him to get the big fish. So relax, man. Now I'm asking you. You're back. - You question him. - Okay. There's a murder. A murder. Gold Finger is killed. You mean that mute fellow! Yes. He was stabbed and hidden in back trunk. The Inspector? He's over there. And the suspect? Inspector is questioning you. How did the corpse get in your car? Sir, I have no idea. Last night I was here all the time. In the morning you came and woke me. So I wouldn't know what happened in between I didn't say you killed him. Because there's a body found in your car... it's natural to suspect you. Where else did you park your car last night? Yesterday, my car... It was parked at home. At teatime I left it at the Dragon Car park. And here too. Sir, I really don't know how the corpse got in my car! Bad luck. How did that happen? Who is the woman there? Your wife? She's a club girl. Club girl? Old-timer, you go and ask her. Okay. Sir, I checked over there. Okay. Hua, how are you getting along? Sergeant. There are quite a many fingerprints on the car. What else was left in the car? Only these. Sir, please don't call my family I'm married I told my wife I was on business. Okay. Come with me. When will your man pick you up? Around eleven. When did you arrive? Almost twelve. What were you doing here for 7-8 hours? Take a close look to see if you know him. Sir, I've never seen him before I don't know him. You damn bastard. Why the hell did you die in my car?! You've the right to remain silent. Anything you say could be used against you in court. Sir, what do you mean? Drop it down. Open the door... We're cops. Open up, or we'll break in. Quick. What happened? The man doesn't open the door. Let me try. Sergeant. You in there, listen well. At the count of three if you don't come out I'll break in for sure. One. Don't shoot. It's me, Sergeant. What're you doing inside? Nothing. Nothing? Why you don't open the door? Come out. Let go. Hi I won't do it. What're you laughing at? Come out and get to work. Yes. You wait for me in the room. Come back soon. Sorry, Lawyer Chui to call you up so late for the bail. Those cops are fierce. Lucky I am no fool I'll let them try my Double Side Kick. You are lucky. They didn't have enough evidence this time. So I could bail you out. Next time you mightn't be that lucky I know. Take it easy I won't let them get the evidence. Besides, I have a good lawyer like you. This, I know. If it weren't for me 90% of your men would be in jail. My men know that. This matter... What took you so long? Don't you know why you're caught? I must be tailed by the cops. No. There's a spy. Spy? No way, you're kidding. Kidding? I saw that mute pointing at your back in the lift. Then the cops caught you outside the mall. Relax, I already killed him I don't want to know. I'm leaving. But I think, amongst your men. There is a spy. Be careful next time. So as to avoid needing bail. Okay. The mute guy ain't one of us. How did he know so much? Maybe there is really a spy. That would be big trouble. Well, maybe not. Maybe it's another rival gang. But we'd have to investigate. Mute's case sure is complicated. Certainly is. Now we know the car owner is innocent. As to why the corpse was in the car. We are still investigating. When we know why the corpse was there we'll know where the man was killed. Sure. Old-timer should be back. They're in bad luck I've been a plain clothes officer for so long. Never had a chance to nab them red-handed. This is the first break. What the hell is it? Loupe is having soup. Trying to relax. The limbs gone numb and a severe headache! From hip to joint and all the way to sacrum. It must be rheumatism. And take some old lotus roots and you will be fine. Loupe. Good, it's all relaxed. Can't see me having a bowl of soup! Go to hell. Hey, Loupe. Your gold necklace is hanging out. You'll be charged with 'Unaccounted-for Income' You're afraid Loupe will be caught, right! He can say it is from his godmother. Hey, stop it or I won't be so kind. Inspector. Inspector. Having soup again? Get to work. Go. Where are the files? I don't know. Inspector said the rookie took it. Ah De has been transferred to another district. And the mute's murder case... may have to do with drug dealer I've got a man... from Archive Dept. He knows much about that. Hua I told you to check the parking lot. Sorry, I forgot. You're ridiculous. Also the fact that it's such a big incident and you don't know. Maybe something bigger happened in the room. So what? None of your concern. Open up, Old-timer. Report, sir. Come in. Yes, sir. Here's the information. That's our new man, Chang Bann. They are your colleagues. He is the Sergeant. Sergeant. Tell us what you got. Yes, sir. According to the Coroners report. The victim took 18 stab wounds. The one on the lungs proved lethal. From the murder to discovery that took no more than 8 hours. There is no identity on the victim. Only a laundry receipt and 72.5 dollars. The killer seems to be an old hand. And he has no previous criminal record. That's all we know for now. Sir I want to check out the laundry and parking lot. Hua. Come with me. Yes, sir. Let's go. Sir, what do you want me to do? Okay guys, it's party time tonight. You look very fresh. Me? I have got a partner for you I've jotted it down. It's all here. Okay. Listen, I ask you one more time. You said the baldie was standing here. That means he has no hair. Sure, no hair. Not one strand. Hua, let's check it. Okay. Mister, could you take us downstairs? Okay. Where? That car parked there. And that baldie was standing there. Are you sure? Yes. How tall is the baldie? About that tall. What was he wearing? It was a leather outfit. What colour? Brown. Those others? I can't remember the rest. Hua. Sergeant, it seems there's been a murder here. Maybe. Call the headquarters to send over some men I'll wait for you. - Okay. - And... Go and get the clothes from the laundry. And take this jade to the lab too. See if we can get any clue. Sure. Right here. Inside. Oh, it's so dark here. Fatty. You pair up with a lady cop. Be alert. Yes, sir. Although this is my first mission I would do my best. Right. Let Loupe keep your pistol. Why? I'm afraid you'll lose the pistol and yourself. We'll have endless trouble by then. So you have no confidence in me? Give it to me, Fatty. Fortunately we landed in the mud. Loupe, stop grumbling. Haven't you ever dated a girl? Isn't it, madam? And you're no better off. Oh, I'm far better than him. Enough. Or the robber will go home. Come here. Fatty. When you two go in try to be passionate I know. Let's go. Just pretend. Don't overdo it. Old-timer, hide under those trees there. Sir, am I here for scouting? You wish! Come along. Sit. Madam, may I have your name? Jiu. Good name. It's a lovely moonlit night. We're like a pair of lovers. Oh, so romantic! Fine. Who wants to be your lover! Farty. You're good. But we're suffering here. It's so quiet here. No wonder the lovers get robbed here. Exactly I will take her to a love-hotel. You think everyone is that rich? No money? Dig in your pocket. No, we would be seen. Fatty is new. You should help him I know. I won't get it wrong. Look out. Or you will hurt your dick. They do not like the lover. Sit closer. A little more intimate. What are you doing? I come over in case you were lonely. Cheer you up a little. It's the inspector who wants me to do that. Who? Are you blind? Watch it! What're you doing inside? It's none of your business. None of my business? I'm a cop. It is my business. Look clearly. Or come along to the station. That's fine... I believe you're cop. Sorry. Really sorry. Come out. Come out. Hey, all out. Come out. Come on. What's with you? What're you doing inside? Nothing. We're chatting. Chatting? With your zipper down? Sorry, sir I must have forgotten after a pee. Forgot, huh? I can charge you for 'indecency in Public' No, no. We were really chatting inside. You can ask her. That's true. Really? Hands up. Not so high. A bit lower. You want me to believe you. Okay, all on one test. Suck your fingers. Suck your fingers. Go on. All ten. Where did you get this one? Come and play with us. Come on. Don't be shy. This chick is really good, yeah! Such nice curves! Back and front, simply impeccable! Big and small all in proportion. You two are damn cowards I won't be like that. See, looks just like water and oil. Yes, the girl is so pretty. And this Fatty is like a pig. Which club is she working at? How about helping me? You're no good. Don't waste it. Yeah. Say something. You're ignoring me, Fatty. Forget it, no sense of humor at all! Let's go. Look at you. Got scared by the gangsters. Hey, you think I'm scared. They're lucky to have escaped. Or I'd have crushed them with half a thigh, you know! It's fun tonight. That girl is so pretty. Yeah, let's play with her. All alone so late at night. Must have broken up with her boyfriend. Yeah. Let's go. Miss, what do you think? Would you like some good time? What're you doing? Don't be afraid. We're good guys. Go away. Let's have some fun. Go away, or I'll call the police. Oh, my brother is a cop I'll call the cops. Go away. Where are you going? What're you afraid of? You're also a cop I am not I am not afraid of robbers I am scared of ghosts. Don't move. Come here. Are you all right? Yes. Did they rob you? No. They teased me. I got scared and yelled. Just teasing you. Were they armed? No. Teasing the girl. Neither of these two. Let them go. Pardon? Let them go. Lady, this time... This time you're lucky. Next time we won't let you go. Go. Sir. Sir. Sir. What? Fatty has been robbed. What? Listen to me, bro. Loupe. If I didn't have to protect the madam I won't be like that. First time out famous, my boy. You don't believe me? This is the watchman's report. Sergeant, the report confirmed that the corpse found in the Villa's car and the time of murder in the parking lot... is the same. Thank you, guys. It's confirmed that the murder occurred at the car park. According to the watchman; He saw a bald man at that time. So we suspect that this bald fellow could be the killer. Loupe. Run a check on the guy and see if this bald man has a history. No need. Just ask him instead. There are two actually. But that's impossible. One is in jail. The other died in a car accident last July. You'd better ask the mute guy's friend. That's difficult I know he has had no friends. What happened to you two last night? Forget it. Okay, everyone takes out 40 dollars. What's that for? We're tired as hell. And paying too? What? I have to pay too? It's alright if you don't pay. It's government money I can claim it from the office. Sir. Don't do that. We'll pay. It'd be too embarrassing if anyone else... knew of it! Damn Fatty. Old-timer. It's a pity that I lost my watch, too. Fatty. Finish this report. Sir. Wow, such hustle and bustle! Can I join you? We won't miss your share. Take 40 dollars out. For the meal? Yes. Hua. Sergeant I've brought back the victim's belongings. The jade definitely belonged to the victim. How about that clothes? Such a big size. It won't fit the victim. Any clue? Maybe. Let me check it. Sergeant, I'll come along. Thanks. Old-timer, you come with me. Shin, come out I have something to talk with you. Old-timer. Arrest him if he refuses. Huh... Hey, buddy. What did I get into this time? Why are you getting me? You trouble me for no reason I'll report it to the Correctional officer. Good I just want to ask the Correctional officer that... what's your relationship with the mute who died. The mute? I don't know any such man. Recognise this jade piece? I have never seen it. Old-timer. Show him the clothes. Ah Shiu. He is right. So don't be stubborn. Talk to him outside I'm going out for a while. Okay I have to say... I don't know about any mute fellow. Just happened to be inmates at the prison. He's not too bad. When he was released he kept coming to me. So I told him all I knew about those things I didn't know he's an informer. You have information. You still stuck with them? No, I told him of the things in the past. The rest is what he dug up himself. The reason that Mute got killed... must be linked with the man he investigated. If they knew you have relation with the Mute fellow you will be in trouble I think you... I won't be your informer. It'd be trouble if my brother's gang comes to know. It's up to you. The killer will find out sooner or later. And you'll lose your life by then. Besides, the mute guy's death is on your shoulders. You just have one choice left. You cooperate with us and get them caught. That's right, my boss is right. You'd better think for your own good. Let's go. Shiu. Long time! What brings you here? Forget it. Big Guy, are you teasing him? You know he is just released and yet you make fun of him. Just kidding. Ah Shiu, it's almost 6 months since you were released. But you haven't visited us. Are you kidding? You know I was under watch at that time. How can I come to you? Then you've been on good conduct for 6 months. Hey, Big GUY. You know I've been doing nothing I've reduced myself to poverty. Could you recommend something? Shiu. Your good snooker skills can earn you a living here. Hey, no need to cheer me up I am so poor. So get me a job or something. Hey, your leg is not yet fully restored. So there's a lot you can't do. Think of something. Shiu, how about going to the Boss? He always mentions you. He says you have integrity. He'll help you. Boss? Where's he now? I don't know where Boss is. Let me finish this game and go look for him. Stop now... Let me finish this game first. Stop. Stop. Take me to the Boss Bo, I'll take him to the Boss. You guys keep playing. You go ahead. Okay. Yet another new place! Yeah. Just one month and got caught. So boss must be inside. Come... place your bet. Hands up when you've decided. Open. It's 3-3-1. Small. It's 'small' again. Big Guy, try your luck here. No way, I've been losing. That's nothing. Try again. Boss is inside. Chatting in the room. Thanks. Let's go. Hey, Fat“! You occupy the seat but don't bet too much. Spare some room for the others. Hands off. Anyway, I am your customer. Why are you so fierce? I quit. Get lost. Okay, tell the Boss I'll fix it. Good, I'm off. Boss, Shiu is here. Hey, Shiu! Come here. Boss. You go to work. Shiu. Take a seat. Drink? Thank you. - Okay then. - Thanks I've been trying to contact you after your release. You had moved. Oh yeah. Couldn't find any job after doing time. So I used to hang around at a garage. Can't earn much repairing cars, huh? I was under watch at that time. So I couldn't dare come here so as to keep you out of trouble. Shiu, please don't say that. You risked life for me I will never forget it. If you can extend a helping hand I'll be most grateful. Please say no more. Take it. Boss, I won't take it without work I get it. I'll need your help later. Take it as an advance payment. Thank you, Boss. After your release... Those cops... will keep an eye on you. For now you'd just do a collection job for me. Boss, thanks for your trust. Shiu, words can't express. You just work hard at it, okay. Two hundred. Three hundred. Four hundred. Five hundred. Six hundred. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Forty. Fifty sixty. Seventy. That's it. Okay. You go first I'll hand in loose change tomorrow. Shiu I know you went to the Boss. Fatty went there to scout. Your subordinates are great. That's enough. Why did you go to the Boss? Don't get me wrong I'm not your informer I went there to see if Boss suspected me. Lucky he didn't know that I knew the Mute. Don't be so sure. They won't let it go. Sooner or later there'll be another murder case I know you're doing collection job for him. So don't do any illegal things or I'll arrest you. You've worked there for a period of time. Do you have any news for me? I haven't been there long enough I didn't know anything well. So I do not have any information for you. Noticed any bald man in there? Bald man? No. You got news? Yes. According to our information it's a bald man who killed the Mute. So, you be alert. Anything comes up, just call me. Bald man I've found that the Mute had a crippled friend. Would it be Shut? No way. Shiu has been helping me after the Mute's incident. It can't be him. You really trust him? Of course. He has integrity. A few years back. He took my place in the prison. So I could walk free until now. He could be the informer at that time. If it isn't him, then who? No need to hurry. Think of something. Okay, I'll get going. These days it's hard to collect money. Bill, you're still here. Shiu, come inside. Yes. Taipan Club. What does he look like? Tall and pale. He always wears brown leather wear. He has a strange look. Looks like a pervert. But I don't know him. Maybe he works for brother Sheng's boss. Shiu, it's hard to locate him with this info. You take me along and point him out. Are you kidding? That guy always glares at me. And you want me to point him out! You want me to die fast, huh! Sergeant, Shiu is right. We'll find him tomorrow night. Shiu, you go first. In case someone would see you. You're right. That will put me in trouble I'll make a move. Tell them to get in the car. Okay. Come on. Come and sit. It's fun today. No fun. Let's go. Or you can flirt with girls. Cut the crap. Really rubbish. Sir, come with me. This way, please. Hua, go. Let me go first. All done. Action after all are ready. Nice dance, buddy I want to talk to you. What is it? One thousand. It could be counterfeit. Is it for seeing or our spending? You want it. It's easy I'm sick of that man there. How about you go and slap him? Know him? No. He is not our man for sure. No. Come. Okay I'll do it. Go. Pal. What is it? Asking your girlfriend for a dance. We're all brothers... please. You look pretty cool. Not too bad. And he wears a hat too. Where are you from? Nine and Four. Nine Four. Never heard of Nine Four; Although a lot of gangsters use the term 4-9. Don't pretend. Look at me. Bozo, look at me. Look at me if you talk to me. Don't misunderstand. I'm a little squint. Oh, slanted sight. Then you look elsewhere when you talk. Fighting. Huh! Freeze. Freeze, cops. You all reach the dancing floor. Go. Quick. Move. Move. Squat down. Move... Stand still. Squat down. You guys. It's not us. Long time no see. Come here. Out. Come here. Move. Please sit. We wear hats too. Sir, we'll never do it again. You don't know what is Nine Four I'll tell you now. That's Kowloon HQ Anti-Triad Group, 4th floor. Clear? Yes. What is your name? I'm Shiung. Not you. I'm asking him. Sir, I thought you are asking me I'll give you one last chance. What's your name? Darkie I'm asking him, not you. Who are you asking? None of your business. I'm squint-eyed. Whoever I look at must answer my question. C) Kay? Yes. What's your name? Why do you answer me? What business are you in? Okay. No more jokes. Get up. Get up I'm asking you, answer me honestly. Or I'll let him do it instead. No, you do. Yes, yes. Who asked you to beat him? C'mon, speak. A man who gave us 1000 dollars... to beat him up. What? Get someone to watch the doorway. Lift up your head. Hear me? Raise your head. Which one? Which one? He is not here now. You say it. Gone. He's really gone. Gone. Inspector, he may have left. Take these four to the station. Release the rest. Get up. Move San. Get up, San. What is it? Someone wants to get me. Why? I had a drink at the disco. Suddenly the cops arrived. Lucky I could run away. What should I do now? Don't rush, I'm calling the Boss now. Big Boss, Ah San here. Bill was almost arrested. No, he's with me now. Okay, okay. I know. What did the Big Boss say? Big Boss said you stay low now. What? Don't show up. Keep your eyes on Shiu... when I'm gone. Okay, I know. Go. Ah Man. Coming. It's trouble. What is it, Boss? Follow Shiu tomorrow morning ls Shiu in trouble? No, Boss suspects him to be a spy. So I have to do something. Okay, I know. What is it? Coffee. Okay. Sergeant. Why he isn't here? He should be here. Loupe. What? It seems someone's stalking him. What should we do? Hold this. Close your mouth. What? Close it. What are you doing? You hit me! Pretend that someone is following you. Don't hit. Don't hit. Don't you dare or I'll kill you sorry... Hey, you hit for real! Just acting. You're no actor and won't stop. You nearly punched my teeth out. Where's Shiu? Ran away probably. He must be scared. Go find him. You finished it in one go. That's no fun. Come again. Hey, what do you drink? Anything will do. Hey, try again. That's no fun. Shiu. What good job the boss asked you to do? Nothing great. Running around to collect money. Boring. But that beats the hell of things before. That's all we can do. We all got the criminal record. Boss worried if things might go astray. You'd better stay at it for now I'll be okay staying at it temporarily. Every time I collected the money back. The new brothers always grumble. They don't treat me like a man. Especially the tall guy. Who? The one going in and out of Boss' room. That guy scoffed at me a few times. You know him? Not really I have seen him a few times I heard Big Boss really trusts him. Even our boss has to make concessions. He took your place now. Who took my place? Who else but the newcomer. You don't know him. He's Dirty Cash. Dirty Cash! Who wants me? Shiu. When did you get released? Half an year now. Hey, you know each other. He always lost at car racing. Big Guy. Who is it? Yes? Tally the result. He quits. Let's talk a bit. Okay. Are you still racing cars? No. So... These days modified cars are great. It's so different nowadays. It can easily go up to 60 mph on start I don't think you'd be able to handle it. Hey, Dirty Cash. Racing cars is a matter of skill. Good cars ain't a sure thing I dare you to race me again. Forget it. Your men will say I bullied a cripple. Even a cripple can beat you at it. So sure, eh! Tomorrow morning I have a test drive. Decide after you've seen that. The disco guy's vanished like air I think he's just hiding himself I can't get a pointer at him. Do you have news of him? I'm just about busted because of it. If you didn't let me go no one will tail me. We don't even know where he's gone; How are we supposed to find him?! Hey, Peter. Hi. Sorry, brother Shiu. Sorry to be late. I got stuck somewhere. And I've waited over an hour for you. Hey, say hi to brother Shiu. Brother Shiu. He is... Let's get to business. Hand me the money. Sorry, Shiu. Of late it's been a little tight. What would you like, sir? Two coffees, please. Okay I'm tight with money these two days I can't even borrow the money. Give me 2 days and I'll pay the rest. Brother I thought after collecting this debt I'll quit. But you just keep making trouble for me. How am I supposed to report it back? I'm going to get kicked out of the gang. Shiu, don't say that. Even I wouldn't want that. Tomorrow I'll get it all for you. Now listen well, you both. This is the last chance I give you. One of my brothers has a test drive tomorrow I'll have to attend it. You give me the money later. Okay, Shiu. Let's go. Waiter, bill please. Your driving skill is neat. Just average. Entering the next round wasn't that simple! Just my luck. That's it for now I'll call you again. See you. That's a gentleman among your friends. Yes, he's quite cultured. Real gentleman. Seven years ago he's a champion here. He is great, you know. So cool. You're great. Better than years ago. Just lucky I almost lost to that guy. Your skill will beat this guy for sure. How is it? Sergeant. He went to the motorcycle shop. Motorcycle shop! Yes I know the man talking to him. He has a background of drug trafficking. Let's go and see. Get in. Ready? We may have trouble. Be careful. Okay. We're watching him. Someone is here. See, it's the Inspector and others. Waiter. Get some tea. What are you doing? Ordered 2 coffees and sat all morning. And kept me to make tea. Would you do it then? Don't order coffee if you can't afford. - Oh damn! - Forget it. Why that long! I've some errands to run. How's the stuff? All fixed. The car is over there. Follow the car as he goes. Don't they know what to do? Yes. We leave and they catch. Fatso. Ready to go. Bill please, waiter. Hey, LOUPe. You haven't seen me for a long time I missed you so much. Huff'! I am working. Get them. Run. Freeze. Freeze. What's wrong with you? Can't you drive? Are you blind? Don't run. Don't run. Stop. Drive. Call the HQ quick. Sergeant, I got him. Take him back. Get in. Why did you take U-turn here? Look what you did! You blind or what? You saw me and yet you kept coming. Shouldn't you compensate for it? Insurance will cover it. Insurance won't pay for this. Are you bullying me? Looks like you wanna fight, is it? You dare to touch me! Fight then. I'm not afraid. Don't touch me again. You think I'm afraid of your size. Drop dead. Dirty Cash is dead. No use even if you get the heroin. He's knocked dead when I chased him. And I'm nearly killed too. Didn't expect him to die so soon! While at the motorcycle shop you should have arrested him. Then all would be just fine. We wouldn't be in a fix like this. Always wanna be wise after the event. A mouthful of nonsense. If your godma wouldn't have run out. We wouldn't be like that. And you blame me too? Let's stop bickering among ourselves. Sergeant. The man with the motorcycle shop. He's really not carrying anything. Sure. It's just that someone gave him the stuff and he passed it to Dirty Cash. Only Dirty Cash knows where the stuffs been sent. Now let's continue the investigation. And soon we'll crack this case I hope so. Inspector I heard we have action tomorrow, right? We haven't decided anything yet. We wait for the Superintendent's decision Jin, what's wrong with you? You mess up the case again. Yes, sir. I am so sorry. Commissioner wants you to take a surprise action. Tomorrow you'd have to solve this case. Okay, tomorrow then. We'll get to it. Senior Superintendent is angry. Don't come back if you fail. Inspector. We haven't found out who is the mastermind. So we have no chance to tackle I know. If we rush, we'll just ruin the whole plan. The Management says we took too long. But we can't let them expand further. So we have to take action now. Come. Let's discuss what should we do tomorrow. We have many areas to take care of. And we have to take action at the same time. So we're going to split. Sir. What is it? Would it be better if we have a spy? Spy? You mean Shiu? Yes. If Shiu agrees, we'll get the Boss. That's nice as well. If we set up a good trap. And let his boss fall into it. Then we'll have a winning edge. No way. If I do it like that. They will know it sooner or later. You want me to die. But. If you don't be the spy. Even if we crack their tricks. We won't get the men behind the scene. Think it over. Like what? They've been suspecting you. You think my Boss is a fool? Listen, Shiu. It's for your own good. For my own good? You put me in jail. You made me a cripple. That's for my own good. Since when you did things for me? I arrested you to keep you from trafficking. If you didn't take heroin like a zombie your mother wouldn't die of anguish. You say my mother died because of me? When my mother was sick and dying she begged you to release me and you refused. Now you want me to risk my neck? Shiu. Are you in it or not? No. Go away. Go away I don't wish to see you. Just go, okay! Don't run. How's it going? All done. You standby. Okay. Hua. Your turn. Stay put. Sergeant is watching. Okay, I know. Be careful. Boss, any clear water salted fish. You fool. No salted fish from clear water I don't know. Uncle Hua asked me here Uncle Hua? Chau is dead. So I came instead. How many? One hundred catty. Old rule. Get some salted fish. Don't move. Cops. Freeze. Don't run. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Don't run. Don't run. No running. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Don't run. Freeze. Don't pretend if you don't know how to use the holster. Handcuff him. Freeze. Move away. All caught? Yes. You take them back first. Next step of the operation. Okay. Don't move. Freeze. Don't move. Go. Squat down. Pass them to the uniformed squad. Let's go to their other joint. Yes. Get up. Ming. What is it? Chiang. This is for Au. Quick. Give him. Let's take a puff first. Chiang. Boss said there's not enough stuff. He's asked you to raise the price. What? They too are short of funds and yet you up the price. How can they afford? Then that's none of my business. If they can't afford, just give up. Stop your nonsense and send the stuff. You two go up there. Old-timer, Loupe. Go. Okay. Freeze. Police! Hold your fire. Sir, what to do with the guy in kitchen? The guy up there can't escape. Release the one in the kitchen. Let him run further. It's almost time. What's Shiu doing? I don't know. Where's the boss? Inside. Boss. What is it? Our men are all caught lam the only one to escape. What about our stuff? The cops took it. Only one left. What? That's all. Okay, you go first. Wait. You coming directly from the joint? Yes. Boss, maybe... Bastard, you are so stupid. Dammit. Hello. Is it the Boss? Yes. There's police at all our places. What? Yes. I'll come over to speak to you. No. You may be tailed. Let's talk later. Shiu, what should we do? We'd be captured if we go down. Staying here doesn't stop them from coming either! No use to get the heat up. Wait for Boss to make a decision. You two will follow me. Shiu. No one knows you're here I'll go to distract the cops. Remember to take the stuff to Shatin Quarry. Wait if you arrive first. Boss, I... Don't refuse. Help me one more time. Keep the account book safe. Go. Remember, Shatin Quarry. It's only the account book. No traffickers' names on it. Shatin Quarry. Sir, rent a room? Yes. Please come. Any room? Yes. Permanent or by hour? By hour. Permanent is cheaper. By hour is fine. Temporary by-hour. Any room? Yes I'll get a lady over. You'll have good time. No. Just the room. You may get a girl for my friend when he arrives. Okay, call me if you need anything. Please come. Look. Nice bed, nice sheet, nice teapot. Nice cups, nice drawer, nice girl. Enough. Leave now. Oh, buddy. You are here. Yes. How is it? Where's the man before? Inside the room. The man in grey? Yes. Room 302. Any room? Yes, ready for you 301 is just next door. Good setup. Take me in. Sit for a while. I'll get you the girl. Ah Ling. What's up? You have a client in room 301 I just finished a job and I am tired. You're insane. It's money, stupid! C'mon hurry. What are you looking at? Why are you looking at the others? Such a wacko! Why are you opening the door again? Oh, now you're taking your clothes off! No, I'm not here for that. There... I've stripped. Anything else? Be quick. What are you doing? Take the chair to bed. Just 100 dollars. What do you want? I quit. What is it? What are you doing? Move over I want to put the chair here. Move over. Damn it. Hold the chair. Be quick. It's service. Help me. Oh, be quick. Your legs are shaking I can't stand it. Finish? No. Don't pull. I'm chasing someone. But you have to pay me. Stop it. I'm a cop. See that? So what? Cops have to pay too I'm on business. No. Can't go. Let me go. No. Don't let him go. Sorry, I'm a cop I'm on duty. No. He didn't pay. Did you see a man... I" grey jacket? You think I have eyes on my back! Why are you here? All our places have been taken over by police. Boss told me to wait for him with the stuff. Big Boss. Sam's place is cracked down. Who's that man? Sam's man. Shiu, Wait. Big Boss. All our places have been cracked down. Get in. Get in. Big Boss. Are you alright? Yes. Watch it carefully. Yes. How do you explain this? I don't have a clue. They all broke in like a blitz! Can't even shift the joint. My home is under watch, too. It's lucky this kid is smart. He took half of them or else I'd be finished I told you there's a spy. And you didn't believe me. Bill, stop bickering. Where's the account book? That's important. I won't forget it. I brought it along earlier. Shiu kept it. Shiu, where's the account book? Give it to the Boss. Tomorrow there's another pack, you... Shiu, you go first. Everyone, be careful. Now is the critical time. Would never have expected such a famous lawyer to be involved. It's him. What? Shiu is the spy. Really. The Mute was his good friend. Don't talk bullshit. That jade belongs to the Mute. What now? Go after him. Okay. Where's Shiu? He went that way. You three, go this way. We'll cut across there. You two go there. I'll go that side. Don't worry. Shiu will be fine. Shiu, are you okay? Shatin Quarry. Hey. Spying? Bastard. That mute guy took 18 cuts. You'll have 36. Ah Ming, step on it. Don't run. Bill Chau. Shiu, stop. Quick. Don't run. After him. Quick. Don't run. Get him. Get him. You two don't come or we'll die together. Shiu. Let me. Search him. Okay. Someone's here. That way. Over there. Quick. They have guns. Two have escaped. Old-timer, get them. Yes, sir. Fatty, cover me. Hua, you follow me. Did you see the lawyer? Lawyer? Yes. Chui Tian Yung is the mastermind. He may be in the Quarry I'll get him. Fatty. Loupe, you go there. Sure. What should we do? We'll fight our way out. Don't run. Freeze. Don't run. Still want to go? Freeze. Freeze. Bastard, I'll kill you! Don't shoot. I didn't kill Shiu. It's my Boss, Lawyer Chui. Handcuff him, Loupe. How is it? I'm alright. I'll live. Cover me. Hua, go help him. Yes. Go. Squat down. Where's the Sergeant? Don't know. Get off. Get off. They are the drug traffickers and he is dead. Get a coroner's van and an ambulance. And you report to the headquarters. Yes. How about you? Wounded. Fatty is quite serious! How is Chui Tian Yung? He died. Well, I'll support Fatty. Be careful. Sir
