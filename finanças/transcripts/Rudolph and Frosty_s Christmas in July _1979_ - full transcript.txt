Hey, Frosty! Hey, Rudolph! What a great June day! Positively balmy. Only ten below. Rudolph, can the kids watch your jumping practice? Sure. [whistles] Milly, Chilly. Okay, daddy. Here we come. Would you light up your nose for us, Uncle Rudolph? Just once. Please? Okay. Just once. Uh, Rudolph. What's the matter with your nose? I-I don't know. It's-it's-it's going out. swoosh [instrumental music] [instrumental music] swoosh [music continues] chirp chirp chirp [music continues] swoosh [music continues] Yes, sir. Believe it or not Rudolph's nose went out and all because of something that started years and years ago, and I mean years. Long before I came to the North Pole all this territory was ruled over by.. ...a powerful magic king of the North Pole named.. ...Winterbolt. roar And this terrible tyrant's powers came from a scepter of solid ice. splat [indistinct chatter] And all the good creatures who dared defy his wickedness were destroyed or driven away from their northland homes. Ha ha ha. Old Winterbolt's tyranny lasted for ages. But one day.. Ohh! Who's.. ...there came a being who was more than his match. Lady Boreal the Queen of the northern lights who took on human form in order to defy Winterbolt and defend the oppressed and innocent. King Winterbolt.. ...for years, I have seen your malevolent cruelty 'and now I take human form to command thee' stop this tyranny at once! You've caused enough pain and unhappiness. You don't frighten me. Be gone. splat You had your chance, cruel monarch of the north and now I must silence you. Forever? Alas, nothing is forever. But you will fall into a deep, deep sleep and so you shall remain so long as my magic burns bright. Aah! Aah! Argh! Too powerful for me. Your force... overwhelms...me. And he fell into a profound sleep of many, many winters. snore And eventually Winterbolt and all his evil were forgotten. The good and gentle creatures returned to the north. First, the animals. And then the little ones.. ...the kringle elves. And I suppose it was Lady Boreal's good grace which led me and my young bride to these northlands. The perfect place for me to build my toy factory 'and carry out my life's mission' 'far away from all who would stop me.' [instrumental music] And the passing years were good to all of us but Lady Boreal's monumental efforts had drained her of most of her magic and all of her strength. She knew her days as a human were numbered. Alas, nothing is forever. But in Santa, the northlands have a kind and true leader and I may rest with ease. And she became again the magic glow of the aurora borealis. swoosh splatt Argh. I am awake. I live again! Ha ha ha. Winterbolt lives! I can't wait to see what's been going on while I've been resting. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ho ho ho. Who is this, my magic eye of snow shows? He looks to be a king. But there can be no king of the north save me. I must rid my northlands of this ho-ho-hoing creature and his flock of Christmas interlopers. But how? Tell me, o Genie of the Ice Scepter. splat His power comes from the love he receives from children all over the world. Is he as powerful as me? At the moment, far more powerful. Then I shall make the world's children love me instead of him. Tell me, how does he please these children? Each Christmas eve, he sets forth in his sleigh and leaves every child a toy before dawn. Ha ha ha. Is that all? Genie, tell me how I might stop him from going forth. Next Christmas eve.. ...have the snow dragons 'create a storm of ice and fog' 'the likes of which the north has never seen.' jingle jingle 'Santa will become hopelessly lost' 'and the toys will never be delivered.' Bravo! Excellent! Then I shall set forth with my own supply of toys in my own sleigh. Ha ha ha. Why, I could be greater than Santa! I'd give the little brats twice as many toys and they would love me more. They'd become lazy and dependent on me and I would rule them all! And when they grew up why, the whole world would be my own personal snowball! (Lady Boreal) 'How little Winterbolt knows' 'of the ways of Santa and children.' 'There's more than just giving toys.' There is kindness and the loving warmth of a family on Christmas morn. These things cannot die. I will not let them. Ahh. But I am so old and weak. Ice and fog on Christmas eve to hinder Santa's sleigh. I must leave him something.. ...small, I fear, to guide him on his way. [whimpering] (Santa) And a little later that day a tiny reindeer was born. Ahh. Have no fear, my little one. Soon your father will be home. Ahh. And I must rest for the moment. Ha ha ha. Little one.. ...I have so little magic left to leave thee. 'Use it wisely and well.' On this small hoof, a magic mark I make. The Christmas star cradled by a snowflake. And with this secret mark the magic of the northern lights lives in thee. 'How, you ask?' Think good thoughts, and you will see. Oh! Will the magic last forever, you wonder? Nothing is forever as I have often said but this magic is strong and your nose will glow so long as you use it for good. If you are tempted, even once to use it for an evil purpose it will be extinguished forever. Do you understand? Uh-huh. And will you never use it for evil? Nuh-uh. [chuckles] And now I leave you, little babe to your mother's love. Use your secret magic well. Oh! What was that? Was someone here? Uh-huh. Nuh-uh...uh-huh. [chuckles] Oh. Can't you make up your mind, my little one? (male #1) 'Hey! Where's my boy?' (female #1) 'Here, my darling.' Flew 300 miles in only 15 leaps when I heard the news and.. Ahh, will you just look at him? Ha ha. My little buck. 'We'll name him..' '...Rudolph!' - Ahh. - Ahh. * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer * * Had a very shiny nose * * And if you ever saw it * * You would even say it glows * * All of the other reindeer * * Used to laugh and call him names * * They never let poor Rudolph * * Join in any reindeer games * * Then one foggy Christmas eve * * Santa came to say * * Rudolph with your nose so bright * * Won't you guide my sleigh tonight * * Then how the reindeer loved him * * As they shouted out with glee * * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer * * You'll go down in history ** jingle jingle Wild snow, what's this you show? A red-nosed reindeer? So that's how Santa defeated my snow dragons. Heh heh heh. It will be a different story next Christmas eve. A red-nosed reindeer is no match for King Winterbolt! splat Hey, it's really going out. What's happening, Uncle Rudolph? What's wrong with your nose? Dimmer.. ...darker, darker, dimmer. Rudolph's magic shall not glimmer. Dark and dim. Dim and dark. Now extinguish magic spark! splat R-R-R-Rudolph.. It's all over, Frosty. My nose is.. ...going. I feel.. ...awful. [moans] Aw, Rudolph, your nose just can't go out. Santa depends on it. Yeah, but.. There's little kids all over the world who'd never get any Christmas presents if you didn't light the way. You're right, Frosty. I can't lose my nose. Unless...unless.. What are you tryin' to say? Can't remember exactly. Something a pretty lady once whispered to me. I...I dunno. But my nose just can't go out! Don't worry. [grunts] beep beep beep - Yay! - Yay! I'm okay now! Good old Uncle Rudolph! It's impossible that his power is greater than mine! There must be a reason. He has the wonder of the aurora borealis within him. A power far greater than thine. So long as he uses the nose for good it can never go out. Then I shall see that he uses it for evil. Not in these northern lands, o master. 'The memory of Lady Boreal still glows here' 'and protects him.' He must be made to leave the North Pole. He sets forth but once a year. 'Christmas eve.' I cannot wait! There must be a way to make him leave now! Help me, o Genie of the Ice Scepter. Look into thine magic eye of snow. 'There you will find the answer.' [instrumental music] (Winterbolt) 'Wh-wh-what's this? A balloon?' How can a hot-air balloon help me lure Rudolph away? Hmm. Ahh.. Heh heh heh. I wonder.. Rudolph! Hey, Rudolph! Hey, it's Milton! Who? The flying ice cream man. 'He keeps his stock up here' 'where it won't melt.' 'And this time every year' 'he picks up a big load' 'to take down to the seashore' 'for the 4th of July weekend.' Wait till you meet him. A million laughs. Come on. Frosty! Milly! Chilly! Dinner's ready, sweethearts! Sorry, Crystal. I gotta meet somebody. Rudolph says he's a million laughs. But I've got dinner on the table. It'll get all warm. You can always cool it up in the ice stove. Come on. A million laughs! (in unison) Come on! Come on! How you doin', Milton? [crying] Awful! What's wrong, Milton? I'm in love! With who? You're in love with the whole circus? I'd call a guy like that fickle. No. Just with her. Lainie Loraine. Her mother owns the circus. We were gonna be married right on the high wire. Hired a preacher and a net and everything. (Rudolph) Well, what happened? (Milton) Aw, the circus is going broke. And another showman a crook named Sam Spangles is ready to pay off the back taxes and take over the show! thud Okay, tack it up over here. (Milton) So ya see? Laine can't even think about romance. 'And if her mom's show' doesn't get a big audience on the 4th it'll be sold to Sam Spangles on July 6th. 'Lainie will have to go on the road..' '...and we'll never get together.' Oh, ha ha ha! What luck! Thank you, eye of snow! Rudolph will never suspect a thing. First, however, I shall put a little idea into Milton's empty head. [whispering] tinkle tinkle fff I don't know what to do. Hey! I just got a great idea! There's only one guy who could draw the kind of crowds the circus by the sea needs. - And that's you, Rudolph! - Me? Why, the kids would just pack that tent to see you and your nose in person. Oh, wow! Uncle Rudolph in the circus? Hey, wait a minute. Rudolph, you just gotta go. Well...if you say so, pal. Okay. It would be wonderful if we could go with him, Frosty. I sure would like the twins to see a real circus. Wow! If you'd appear, too, Frosty we'd have to get a bigger tent! - Aw, daddy! - Can we? Please? We'd be good! No way! The seashore on the 4th of July? We'd be real misfits. We'd melt in ten seconds flat. (in unison) Aww. Bein' snow people has its drawbacks. Sometimes I feel like a real misfit. Aw, Frosty, I just forgot for a minute. I'm sorry. Why, I wouldn't have us any other way. [instrumental music] * Everything I've always wanted * * You are everything I've always wanted * * And I'll never let you go * * I will take deserted byways * * Dusty roads or cement highways * * Follow you though rain or sleet or snow * * In my wildest dreams * * I never dreamed I'd find somebody * * I would love much more than I could ever show * * You are everything I've always wanted * * More than anything * * And if there's any doubt well now you know * [music continues] * You are everything I've always wanted * * More than anything * * And if there's any doubt well now you know * * And if there's any doubt well now you know ** That melting business is a nuisance but it doesn't make you all misfits, Frosty. Take it from another misfit. If only there was some way to make you unmeltable. swoosh (in unison) Wow. Like a Fairy Godfather. Oh, ho ho. Just say I'm an old, old magical friend who wishes to help. Heh heh heh. Children should see a circus at least once in their lives. So I will...help. Ha ha ha. But what can you do, sir to stop Frosty and his family from melting? Observe. Magic amulets. (Winterbolt) 'If Frosty, Crystal, Milly, and Chilly' 'wear them about their necks, they cannot melt.' Even though the temperature be hot enough to melt steel still they will remain cool and icy. Wow! Our troubles are over forever! No...not forever. See. On each is a design. 'The letter F, four times entwined.' Yeah! "F", "F", "F", "F"! What's that stand for? That means the amulet's magic only lasts until the final firework fades on the 4th. You must return here before the fireworks finish or you will melt in the heat of the summer eve. But until then? Why...you will be safe. [chuckling] (in unison) Wow! The circus! swoosh Wow! He certainly does blow in and blow out. [all laughing] Well, I'm delighted you're all going for a summer holiday but...I never heard of any icy Fairy Godfather. You should have seen him, sir. I wish I had. Who could he be? Hmm. Well, I guess I'm.. ...just being overcautious. [chuckles] Uh, you-you all go on and ha-have a wonderful time. (all) Yay! Yay! Just one thing. What's wrong, Frosty? It's too bad the kids have to miss the 4th of July fireworks. But half a vacation's better than none, I guess. No, you're right. Children should see fireworks. Let me think. And now to entwine them just a bit more into a morass from which they will never escape. Ha ha ha. [chanting] fff tinkle tinkle Hey! I just got a wonderful idea! Mama and I will fly my sleigh down for the 4th. We'll pick up Frosty and family just before the fireworks finish and whisk back up to the North Pole by the time the last one fades. Wonderful. What a neat idea. I can't believe it. Rudolph, Frosty, and-and now Santa. Why, this-this really will be the greatest show in the-in the universe! Ho ho ho ho! Yes! It will! [all laughing] * Everything I've always wanted * * You are everything I've always wanted * * And I'll never let you go * * I will take deserted byways * * Dusty roads or cement highways * * Follow you though rain or sleet or snow * * In my wildest dreams * * I never dreamed I'd find somebody * * I would love much more than I could ever show * (Santa) 'See you in a few days!' * You are everything I've always wanted * * More than anything * * And if there's any doubt well now you know ** [music continues] (Crystal) 'Oh, Frosty, it's lovely.' Oh, look over there. It's the circus! (Milton) 'Yup. They're starting to set up their tents.' Come on, you guys, let's get this tent up! Oh, mama, look. It's Milton. [all cheering] Hi, Lainie. Hi, Mrs. Loraine. Oh, mama, isn't he wonderful? He's the greatest ice cream man in the world. Oh, forget him, honey. There's one thing life's taught me. You can't live on banana splits. [instrumental music] Lainie, look who I've got for the show. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman! - In person. - In person. Well, I'll be, uh.. Yahoo! Oh, mama, we'll be a hit! What do you think of Milton now? Maybe I was wrong. Milton's like the butter pecan he sells. A little nuts but mighty yummy! Wahoo! bang Oh, Milton. [instrumental music] Oh, Lainie. Now everything will turn out alright. Rudolph and Frosty? I can't believe it. And Santa Claus, too. Santa, too? What an idea for a closing act! [gun firing] Print more tickets! Why, it's just like Christmas is coming early this year. Oh, Milton, everything is just perfect now. Now we got something to work for. Come on with that tent! 'Heave ho ho ho!' 'Heave ho ho ho!' What's with the "ho ho ho?" Well, it is Christmas, isn't it? * Christmas in July seems early * * For a holly * * Holiday * * In this world of hurly burly * * We need it * * Every day * * Remember you should have the Christmas spirit * * Only for the whole year through * * Every day is just like Christmas * * As long as I'm * * With you ** And I suppose they believe everyone will live happily ever after. Never! And now for the snow dragons. Make yourselves ready, my pretties. roar roar Build fury in your hearts. Soon I will have a very special job for you. 'Ha ha ha.' What is thy will, o master? Genie of the Ice Scepter find me a reindeer as mean as Rudolph is kind as cunning as Rudolph is guileless as selfish as Rudolph is giving. A corrupt, cunning knave of a creature with ambition to equal my own! But why, o master? All part of my plan, good genie. All part of my plan. Find me such a reindeer! Beyond the forest of the burned Christmas trees.. ...and the hill of the broken baubles.. ...there you will find the caves of lost rejections. Ask the keeper for.. swoosh [intense music] He's in cave number 13. I wish to see him. You ain't the only one. I've been tryin' to throw him out all week. (male #2) 'Behind in his rent, he is.' 'But he's mean, and I don't fancy riskin' my neck.' Thirteen, you say? That's right. This way. Hmm. [animals grunting] (Winterbolt) 'Scratcher!' (Scratcher) 'What you want?' Come forth. 'Heh heh heh. Make me.' Very well. splat (Scratcher) 'Hey! What's happening?' Alright. Alright. For crying out loud. I'll pay the rent. I don't want the rent. I want Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. And you will help me. Rudolph! Don't mention that name. I was all set to be one of Santa's reindeer when he came along. Indeed. Santa fired you to make room for Rudolph? Well, I also stole some toys and ate a whole new batch of candy canes. Candy.. Excellent! Ha ha ha. It was all downhill from there.. ...till I finally ended up in this joint. Good. How would you like to work for me? Mmm. Doing what? Destroying Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Sounds like a good job to me. Heh heh. What do I gotta do? Oh, nothing much. Spend a few luxurious days at the seashore get to know Rudolph lead him astray as it were. Gee, it sounds like a pretty good idea. Ha ha ha. Now go at once and find a man named Sam Spangles. And then.. Well, Mrs. Loraine, we're finally ready to open. We worked night and day, kid, but we made it. Boy, running a circus is no easy job. Well, I tell ya, Blinky, it's got its ups and its downs. Life with the circus is like life with a guy. 'Sometimes you're low, and sometimes you're high.' * Chicken today and feathers tomorrow * * One day is good and the next day there's sorrow * * I don't care what * * Long as I got my guy * * Chicken today and feathers tomorrow * * One day I lend and the next day I borrow * * I don't care what * * Long as I got my guy * * I'm like a river * * Rollin' along * * A carefree river singin' a song * * And where my hat is that is where I belong * * Chicken today and feathers tomorrow * * Life is that way * * There's some joy and some sorrow * * I don't care what * * Long as I got my guy * * I'm like a river rollin' along * * A carefree river singin' a song * * And where my hat is that is where I belong * * Chicken today and feathers tomorrow * * Life is that way * * There's some joy and some sorrow * * I don't care what * * Long as I got my guy * * I don't care what * * Long as I got my guy ** swoosh Now, have you memorized your instructions? Don't worry. Me and Sam Spangles will take care of everything. Good. Here. Nibble on these. 'These are Santa's magic feed corn.' Hey. That means I'll be able to fly like Donner and Blitzen and all those other goody-goods. [dramatic music] Now fly forth and do my bidding. What's the hurry? Soon, my pets here will blow up the worst snowstorm of the century. Well, what if I get lost? I mean, I don't have a red nose, you know? You'll be well out of these parts before the storm hits. Ha. I think.. Will you go forth forthwith? splat Oh, soon. Soon, my little pets. We mustn't be hasty. Ha ha ha. Timing is everything if my intricate plan is to succeed. [instrumental music] You really are looking forward to this trip, aren't you? Papa, I haven't had a summer vacation since.. Can't remember when. We work too hard, mama. Oh, I guess I'm not the easiest man in the world to live with, though. [chuckles] Well, only when it gets close to Christmas eve. Oh, ha ha ha. [sighs] Ah, we have had lots and lots of Christmas eves, mama. They were good times, papa. And I still love you. Just as much as the first day I saw you. Instead of talking, you gave me a lovely China doll. Well...giving toys is my way of.. ...saying hello. And showing my love. I know that, papa. Mwah. [giggles] [both laughing] Mama. chime Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Eleven o'clock, papa. - Oh. - The circus parade's at 12:00. - Oh. - Hurry, or we'll miss it. (Santa) 'Yeah.' - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha. Yes. Hurry. Go on, laugh, you old fools while you may. Ha ha ha. [indistinct chatter] Thank you, little kringles. We'll be back.. ...late tonight. Don't wait up. (Santa) 'Away!' Away! Away. Ho! [instrumental music] [dramatic music] Use fog to blind and snow to bury wind to tear the heart that's merry. Ice and gale and sleet, and hail Santa must, in his mission fail! roar swoosh Oh. Brr. Ooh, that's an angry wind for this time of year. Yes, I-I don't like it at all. - Oh, papa! - Huh? Look! [gasps] (Santa) 'My goodness! No!' We've got to get back! Back! Dasher! 'Dancer! Comet!' It's too late, papa. It's got us. Hold on, mama! swoosh Oh! If only Rudolph were here! [dramatic music] dong [marching band music] Ha ha ha. swoosh jingle jingle Well, we're safe here in the storm's eye, mama. But I'm afraid it's only for a little while. Papa, do you think we'll ever get out? Well, storms are strange things, dear. Uh, I mean.. Are you frightened.. ...of what may happen? No, my dear. Not at all. Even with this storm.. * I see rainbows * * When I look at you * * And the rain goes * * As the sun comes through * * All things wonderful * * Are what you are * * You shine brighter * * Than the brightest star * * I see roses blooming * * In the snow * * Roses growing * * Everywhere you go * * I see rainbows * * When I look at you * * Rain or shine * * I'll be part of your life ** swoosh Papa.. ...we've gotten out of worse situations than this. Yes. I say the best thing to do would be to get down from these stormy skies and continue on the ground. Alright, mama. We'll try it. Hang on. [instrumental music] swoosh [instrumental music] * Don't let the parade pass you by * * Live livin' it up till you die * * Always be hep * * And keep in step * * With the times a-changin' * * Change your life when it needs rearrangin' * * You've gotta believe in your gut * * You'll never get caught in a rut * * Don't be afraid * * You've got it made * * If you don't let the parade * * Don't let the parade pass you by * [music continues] * With the times a-changin' * * Change your life when it needs rearrangin' * * You've gotta believe in your gut * * You'll never get caught in a rut * * Don't be afraid * * You've got it made * * If you don't let the parade * * Don't let the parade pass you by go fly * * Don't let the parade * * Pass you by ** Smile, Frosty. Lilly says that in show business you gotta keep smiling. But I'm kind of worried that Santa won't be here on time. Daddy, the show must go on. That's what Aunt Lilly says. Okay, but I got a feeling tonight there's gonna be a real wet act and it won't be the seals. [music continues] Are you Sam Spangles, the circus man? How can I be a circus man without a circus? I think I might have an interesting proposition. [both laughing] Just do your act like you did in rehearsal, Blinky. and we're bound to be a hit. I'll try, Mrs. Loraine. I sure will try. Well, I gotta give a pep talk to the clowns. Hang in there, Blinky. Hey, Rudolph. Huh? Scratcher? Oh, the big star remembers his old buddy. We were never buddies. Let bygones be bygones. [coughing] What's the matter? Boy, I am really down and out. Haven't had a bite to eat in three days. Think you could get me a job with the show? I guess we could always use another roustabout to help with the tents. You're a prince, Rudolph. A prince! I'll speak to Mrs. Loraine. Yeah, you do that, Rudolph. You just do that. Ha ha ha. Sucker. Perfect. Perfect. Everything going according to schedule. Now to tighten the net. Ha ha ha. hiss hiss hiss Ah, what a magnificent sleigh and team the snow genie has created for me. Instead ofreindeer I haverein-snakes. Ha ha ha. To the top of the porch to the top of the wall now slink away, slink away slink away...all. swoosh (Winterbolt) 'Ha ha ha.' Onward! Onward! [instrumental music] Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the new edition of Lilly Loraine's circus by the sea. Bring on the clowns. honk honk [whistles] [groans] This is a great job you got me, Rudolph. Well, just do it well and I'm sure you'll get a promotion. Oh, I ain't complaining, ol' buddy. Oh, uh, Mrs. Loraine wants me to get something out of the office wagon but it's all dark in there. I think a fuse blew. Will you come in with me and give me some light? But I've gotta do my act. Oh, but it won't take a minute. Let me finish hauling this thing and I'll meet you over by the wagon. Well...okay. Oh, you really are a buddy, ol' buddy. [groans] This is hard. Oh, it.. It's so late, mama. Poor Frosty. We're doing everything we can, papa. Look up there, mama. Black as pitch. Not a star in the sky. [dramatic music] Onward! Onward! We don't want to miss the fireworks, do we? 'Ha ha ha.' [drumroll] [gasping] Oh. I forgot my parasol. How many times I got to tell you? Make notes for yourself. Yes, mama. [audience cheering] [instrumental music] And now.. ...presenting one of our star attractions 'Frosty the Snowman and family' in a sensational.. ...spellbinding exhibition of world championship belly-whopping. Now meet the folks. [cheering] Like I always say the family that slides together abides together. You don't always say that, Frosty. Stick to the script, daddy. If Santa don't get here soon we'll be sticking to everything. Come on. [music continues] Hey, I've been waiting for you over by the office wagon. Come on, Rudolph. [instrumental "Rudolph The Red-NosedReindeer"] That's my warning cue. Look, as soon as I'm done I'll meet you by the wagon, I promise. That's my buddy. Ha ha ha. Lights, please. Bring out the fog machine, boys. rattle [music continues] (Loraine) 'Are you ready, Rudolph?' (Rudolph) 'I am ready.' Then lights on, Rudolph. (Rudolph) 'Lights on.' (Loraine) 'He's burned off the fog.' Let's hear it for Rudolph. [cheering] (Loraine) 'He'll be back, folks.' 'He'll be back.' His act is over. Quick. Here's the rest of the disguise. Just think.. ...me, Sam Spangles, a policeman. Ha ha ha. Here he comes. Hide. Good ol' buddy. Now turn it on. She said it's under the table here. What are you looking for? She said it was a little leather suitcase. Oh, there it is. Gee, thanks, ol' buddy. Oh! Oh! Oh! I hurt myself. Just taking a little fall like that? I twisted my nose my neck, or something. Now I can't pick up that suitcase. Buddy, would you do it for me? Well...sure. All this fuss over a little suitcase. What's inside? Well, she didn't say. Just pick it up and give it to the cop waiting on the corner. Okay, but.. Hey, this bag is filled with money. The night's receipts. Oh. That's why she wants to give it to the cop. So he can take it to the bank and make a night deposit. Well...okay. And now for our grand Christmas in July finale. [instrumental music] * I heard the bells on Christmas day * * Their old familiar carols play * * And while they sleep * * The words repeat * * Of peace on earth goodwill to men ** Whether July or December Christmas lives in our hearts but it's up at the North Pole, remember where Christmas always starts. Ho ho. Ho ho. Ho ho. Hee hee. Ha ha. Hoo hoo. Ho ho. Ho ho. Where are my elves? Oh, hark. Here they come now. thud thud Elephants? I thought the midgets were gonna play the elves. Nah. They wanna play the polar bears. Actors. Very good, elves. But I have an idea of what will bring all of us lots of cheer. So just to please all the girls and the boys why don't we have a parade of the toys? [instrumental music] [music continues] And now, to make us all feel jolly my very best toy.. ...a dancing dolly! [instrumental music] * Rockin' around the Christmas tree * * At the Christmas party hop * * Mistletoe hung where you can see * * Every couple tries to stop * * Rockin' around the Christmas tree * * Let the Christmas spirit ring * * Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie * * And we'll do some caroling * * You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear * * Voices singing let's be jolly * * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * * Rocking around the Christmas tree * * Have a happy holiday * * Everyone dancin' merrily * * In the new old fashioned way * * You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear * * Voices singing let's be jolly * * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * * Rockin' around the Christmas tree * * Have a happy holiday * * Everyone dancin' merrily * * In the new old fashioned way ** [cheering] Oh, thank you, me fine lad. Well...off to the bank. Where were you, Rudolph? Frosty, something funny is going on. I don't think it's so funny. I'm just about ready to give up hope. Oh, I don't mean that. Here's your star. Aw, Frosty, Santa gave his word. 'He'll be here before the fireworks are over.' I don't know. You ever see a policeman wearing a helmet? No, but then I never looked for one, either. Sure I'm not too heavy? No, but you're kinda chilly. [applause and cheering] Well, that's the show, folks. A little corny, but expensive. Be sure and hang around outside for a free 4th of July fireworks display. And come back again next year! [instrumental music] You hear that, Rudolph? Time for the fireworks. I heard, Frosty. I just don't understand. And all that business with scratcher. Something's real wrong here. Come on, daddy, Uncle Rudolph. Don't want to miss the fireworks. Miss 'em? I'd like to stop 'em. Why do you want to stop them, daddy? - Aren't you patriotic? - Sure, I'm patriotic. My only regret is I only have but one life to melt for my country. Wait a minute, Frosty. What you just said! Maybe we can stop the fireworks. Yeah. Let's find out who's setting them off. You go this way. I'll go that. boom boom - Ooh! - Ahh! Mrs. Loraine, you've gotta help me. Anything, Frosty. You just name it. Stop the fireworks. You named the wrong one. - Huh? - I can't stop 'em! Once the main fuse is lit they keep goin' even if a cloudburst poured down on top of 'em. boom - Ooh.. - Ooh.. Why do you want 'em stopped? Well, I-I got a funny kind of feeling. About fireworks? No. About melting. How many are there? Exactly a hundred. That's number three. I'm counting, I'm counting. boom [audience cheering] Which one's number 100? Right over there. (Frosty) 'That's my number, alright.' And when my number goes up, my number is up. And where's Santa? jingle jingle swoosh Still no sign of it lettin' up, mama. I'm afraid we're gonna be too late to save Frosty. It's not your fault, papa. All we can do is keep going. Yeah. Hyah! Faster! boom That's number 72. Daddy, why are you so worried about the pretty fireworks? Children, you must be very brave. Aw, gee. Why did I get everybody into this mess? boom Seventy four. We promise to be brave, mommy. I'm very proud of you. boom Seventy five. Oh, Frosty. There, there, honey. I just want you to know that I'm sure glad I married you. I am, too, love. * You are everything I've always wanted * * More than anything * * And if there's any doubt * * Well now you know ** boom Seventy six. Boy, I remember when I could only count to four. The good ol' days. boom boom Ha ha ha. Now to go down and put out Rudolph's light for good. (Loraine) 'Hey! We've been robbed!' I went to get the money to give to Officer Kelly here and it's gone! He's the policeman it was supposed to go to? Well, yeah. Why? Didn't you send scratcher to fetch it? Me? Let a roustabout reindeer handle the loot? I ain't that daffy! - Oh, wow! - Hey! What do you know about this, Blinky? boom (all) Ninety one. Daddy, mommy, look! - It's Santa! - Frosty, it's a sleigh! Huh? Oh, boy! Wait a minute. It's a sleigh, alright but it's not Santa. boom [dramatic music] screech splatt Oh, how I've waited for this moment. boom Ninety three! Sir? Sir? My name is Winterbolt. King Winterbolt. A king? Gee! Your-your Majesty Santa never showed up. Yes, I know. Frosty's time is almost over. Just seven more fireworks. boom Correction. Six. That was number 94. You've just got to make those amulets last a little longer. Maybe even a lot longer. Of course. Of course, my dear friends. You hear that, Frosty? Oh, wow. Wait till I tell the wife and the kids! One moment! Huh? boom Ninety five. Oh, we don't have to bother keeping count anymore. Oh, yes, you do. What do you mean? I will make the amulets' power last, Rudolph only so long as your nose remains extinguished. My nose is not extinguished. Really? Try to light it. boom Ninety six! Go ahead, Rudolph. I'm trying. I'm trying real hard. [groans] Ha ha ha. [snickering] Rudolph! What's wrong? It-It won't light up. What did you do to it, Winterbolt? I didn't do a thing. You did it to yourself. You used your nose for an evil purpose. You robbed the money from the box office wagon and gave it to one Sam Spangles. Sorry, sucker. I don't understand. They tricked me, Frosty. Well, I'm gonna set things straight. I'll tell everybody what really happened. No, you won't. I warn you, if clear your name to save your nose the Frostys all will melt. Admit your guilt, and I will allow them to remain frozen. boom Ninety seven! boom 'Ninety eight! Only two more.' (Winterbolt) 'What do you say, Rudolph?' Okay. I won't tell anybody the truth. I'll take the blame and let my nose go out. boom Ninety nine! But you-you just can't let your nose go out forever, Rudolph. I don't have any choice, Frosty. Come on. We only have one firework left. [all laughing] Only one more. Where is Frosty? Hey, what's goin' on here? Mrs. Loraine, I-I stole that money. - What? - Uncle Rudolph? I don't believe it. No, he-he.. I mean, I can explain. No, Frosty, don't! I stole the money, ma'am, and I gave it to Sam Spangles. Spangles? That means he takes over the show. Rudolph, what got into you? I can't explain. boom One hundred! Oh, Frosty! Relax, Crystal. We aren't going to melt. See? Why.. Why, you're right! (Milly) 'Mommy, we're saved.' (Chilly) 'Oh, daddy, we're not gonna melt.' Congratulations. Now you don't have to worry. I'm sorry, Rudolph, but I don't want the twins associating with a dishonest reindeer. Aw, Uncle Rudolph. Why'd you do it? No, wait. You don't understand. Frosty, you must never tell them that I didn't do it. - But, Rudolph-- - Never! What's more important? A silly old red nose or the lives of my best friend and his family? Aw, Rudolph, what can I say? You sure are a friend. Hey. That funny little mark on your hoof the star inside the snowflake, it's gone! Yes, I know. [all laughing] Come. You're the number one reindeer of the north now. You bet! Away! Away! [instrumental music] So long! Okay, creeps, there's gonna be some changes around here. Y-y-you don't own the show yet! Wanna bet? Who's gonna pay to see.. * Rudolph the unlit reindeer * * With a very nothin' nose ** Ha ha ha. He he ha! I can't wait till tomorrow night! (in unison) 'Boo!' (Rudolph) 'I'm sorry' but I can still do my jumps. (in unison) 'Boo! Boo!' (in unison) 'We want our money back!' 'We want our money back!' 'We want our money back..' Rudolph? How can you even speak to him after what he did to my mother? But there must be some reason. We're old friends. You can tell me, Rudolph. There's nothing to tell. I stole the money and gave it to Sam Spangles. - But, Rudolph-- - Just-just let me be, Milton. You heard him. Let's go, Milton. Goodbye, Rudolph. Goodbye...for good. [instrumental music] * No bed of roses * * That's how life seems to be * * No bed of roses * * No easy way for me * * You were my star glow * * But now you're gone * * You took the roses * * But left each thorn * * Go on without me * * But if you change your mind * * One thing about me * * I won't be hard to find * * If there's a glow again * * I know that life can be * * A bed of roses * * For you and me ** creak There must be something I can do alone that wouldn't hurt the family. Maybe I could give Winterbolt something in exchange. But what do I have that he'd want? Ha ha ha! What indeed? His corncob pipe? He does have something. I dunno. He might have something. Why not ask the genie? Frosty the Snowman has his own magic which could prove quite valuable. Really? Tell me, what is it? His hat. Let me show you, o master. [instrumental music] * Frosty the Snowman * * Was a jolly happy soul * * With a corncob pipe and a button nose * * And two eyes made out of coal * * Frosty the Snowman * * Is a fairy tale they say * * He was made of snow but the children know * * How he came to life one day * * There must have been some magic in * * That old silk hat they found * * For when they placed it on his head * * He began to dance around * * Oh Frosty the Snowman * * Was alive as he could be * * And the children say he could laugh and play * * Just the same as you and me ** Just think, if you had that hat and could find the secret of its magic.. '...you could duplicate it over and over again, o master.' [drum roll] (Winterbolt) Why, you could bring an army of snowmen to life. [drum roll] (Genie) 'And Frosty, the only one who knows the true secret' 'of Rudolph's nose..' '...would be lifeless.' Yes, and I would be safe. But what could I give Frosty for his hat? Lie to him, my master. Deceive him. Tell him you have the power to restore the borealis light to Rudolph's nose. The light. Ha ha ha. Of course. Of course! Gee, I'd do anything, anything to help Rudolph. [chanting] fff I know what to do. (Winterbolt) 'Faster! Faster!' 'Back to the circus lot.' [dramatic music] More fireworks? (Lady Boreal) Rudolph. That voice. I remember. I am no more.. ...but my love, in the form of the northern lights watches over thee. Oh, what am I gonna do? Have no fear when you defend the helpless. I don't understand. Be brave. Be very brave and the star in the snowflake will return. You mean there's a chance my nose will light up again? Be brave. Be very brave. No! Don't go! Alone again. (Big Ben) 'Rudolph, is that you up there on the beach?' - What now? - Out here, in the water. Big Ben. The clockwork whale. 'Remember me? I work for Father Time.' Sure, I remember. What are you doing here? Strangest thing... like I was led to you. I was under the water following the glow of the northern lights. Came up to get a good look 'and there you were.' Aw, Ben. I've got problems. Well, little feller, you tell 'em to me. I got a big shoulder to rest your head on. 'And it's wet already, so a few tears won't hurt.' 'Heh heh heh.' So you want to give me your hat, eh? Only if you can turn Rudolph's nose back on. Why, of course I can. What did you say? Oh, it's hardly worth it. It is to me. This hat is what keeps me all living. - Without it-- - Oh, very well. I'll make the trade. Would you say goodbye to Crystal, Milly, and Chilly for me? Especially Crystal. Oh, Crystal, if only we could be together one more time. 'But that's impossible.' So I hope you'll remember all the good times. [instrumental music] * Now and then * * Will you think of me * * Not I hope as a memory * * I'll always love you * * As I always loved you * * Wherever you may be * * In my heart * * There's a golden glow * * You alone keep it shining so * * Parting brings sorrow * * But maybe tomorrow * * With luck we'll meet again * * If only now * * And then ** And that's the whole story, Big Ben. Oh, that's terrible. Rudolph, you gotta get your nose back. I can't. If I tell the truth that means Frosty has to melt. Not necessarily. No time to explain. I gotta swim like thunder. [instrumental music] Where are you going? To south Amer...ica! South America? Now, give me your hat. [dramatic music] Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha. (Rudolph) 'What's going on here?' The poor frozen fool gave me his hat when I promised to return your nose. You know you can't do that. Yes, I know. But he didn't. Ha ha ha. Okay, Winterbolt, you asked for it. You've got to catch me first. Ha ha ha! swoosh (Crystal) 'Frosty.' Frosty. Frosty, where are you? Oh, no! No! Don't look, children. [dramatic music] Come on out from there! I know where you're hiding. (Winterbolt) 'Come and get me.' Okay, I will! [dramatic music] hiss Surprise! Ha ha ha! 'Surprise!' 'Ha ha ha!' hiss thud creak Ha ha ha! You don't frighten me. The hat is mine. 'Try and get it.' [grunts] Hey! Oh. Oh, no. No! It's impossible! It's like Lady Boreal said. It's back for good. Ha ha ha! I warn you! 'I warn you!' I will not be defeated! [crying] Oh, daddy. But-but can't he get another hat, mommy? Children, remember him as he was. Poor roly-poly little son of a gun. Alright, all you jerks clear out of here. Show's mine now. (Rudolph) 'Not so fast!' Huh? Hey, you got your beak back. That's not all we've got back. Go ahead, officer. Here's your money, Mrs. Loraine. Rudolph was tricked into taking it. He's innocent as a newborn babe. Well, I'll be blasted! One other thing. (Kelly) 'Rudolph risked his life to get this back.' For you, sir. [yawns] Happy birthday. [all cheering] What are we celebrating? You! Oh! Good idea. Here's your dough. The circus is still mine. I'll be taking that. Why? You won't be needing it in jail. Oh, Rudolph, we're so sorry for the way we acted. What can we do to make it up? Aww. It wasn't your fault. Gee. Thanks, Rudolph. Thank you. You gave everything you had for me. Well, didn't you give everything for me? I mean, us misfits got to stick together. Put it there, pal. [all cheering] * We're a couple of misfits * * We're a couple of misfits * * What's the matter with misfits * * That's where we fit in * * We're not Daffy and Dilly * * Don't go around willy nilly * * Seems to us kind of silly * * That we don't fit in * * We may be different from the rest * * Who decides the test * * Of what is really best * * We're a couple of misfits * * Not a couple of nitwits * * What's the matter with misfits * * That's where we fit in * * Why am I such a misfit * * I am not just a nitwit * * I'm a dear of a reindeer * * Why don't I fit in * * Why am I such a misfit * * I am not just a nitwit * * There's no man like a snowman * * Why don't I fit in * * We may be different from the rest * * Who decides the test * * Of what is really best * * We're a couple of misfits * * Not a couple of nitwits * * What's the matter with misfits * * That's where we fit in * * That's where we fit in ** [all cheering] swoosh Not so fast. I still have my scepter. 'Destruction to you all!' This one looks like my job! But, mama, there are only blanks in those guns. Yeah, but the guns are made of iron. crash No. No! My...my powers are gone! 'When the scepter dies, I go, too.' I turn...I turn...turn.. I turn.. 'into...a..' '...tree.' [all gasp] - Oh! - Wow! Ha ha. What an exit! jingle jingle Mama, the storm's gone. Like.. ...a miracle. Now we can be to the shore in a few minutes. Up! Up! Dash away all! [instrumental music] Well, our troubles are over. Kinda dull, huh? Well, I'm glad old Winterbolt's powers are gone. Me, too. - Hey! Wait a minute! - What is it, Blinky? If all his powers are gone that means those amulets are no good, either. Frosty! Crystal! [crying] Lainie, what happened? [sniffling] Well, the sun came out, and...and they just-just.. Look! (Rudolph) 'Aw, gee whiz!' 'Aw, after all we went through.' 'I should have realized.' 'It's too late now.' When Frosty melts, nothing can help except a magic December wind to unmelt him. And this is July! Yeah, but where are we gonna find a Christmas wind in July? (Big Ben) 'Right here!' And I brought Jack Frost with me. Hey, Rudolph! How'd ya do it, Ben? Had to go all the way to South America. That's where winter goes in July. Heh heh heh. Jack Frost, do your stuff! I've got to aim real carefully or I'll give colds to all the kids on the beach. Well...here goes. fff [instrumental music] (in unison) Happy birthday! [all cheering] Come on, gang. Let's dig them out. Keep that cold breath on them, Jack. Look! [music continues] Great jumpin' geraniums! Santa Claus is finally comin' to town! fff Papa, we'd better get going before Jack runs out of breath. I'll stick with the show, sir until they're out of debt. Well, they should be out of debt real soon. Ho ho ho. I gave Lilly some of my magic corn feed. The kind that makes animals fly. Wow. A circus by the sea is one thing but a flying circus by the sea. (in unison) Daddy! Daddy! Can we stay and see it? Oh, Frosty, could they? No deal! Enough's enough. [all laughing] Then...then let's get going! Ha ha. Away! [instrumental music] Gee, I kind of miss not being with Santa. Blinky, you want to lead something through the sky you got it! - What? - Forget the sleigh. It's time for the flying circus parade with you right up front. Okay! [instrumental music] * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer * * Had a very shiny nose * * And if you ever saw it * * You would even say it glows * * All of the other reindeer * * Used to laugh and call him names * * They never let poor Rudolph * * Join in any reindeer games * * Then one foggy Christmas eve * * Santa came to say * * Rudolph with your nose so bright * * Won't you guide my sleigh tonight * * Then how the reindeer loved him * * As they shouted out with glee * * Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer * * You'll go down in history ** [instrumental music]
