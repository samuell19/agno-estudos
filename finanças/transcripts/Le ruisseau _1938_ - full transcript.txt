The Lobster Film team The Stream A film by Based on Screenplay - Dialogues Technique collaboration Introducing And Hey! Here is the pilot! Hello, Mr. KÃ©naÃ«l! - Are these your new working clothes? - Yes. I barely recognized you! - I'm marrying my son today. - Oh, that's why! Congratulations, gentleman. And your captain had to choose a new dock! It's always the same. When I married my daughter last year, - I had to slip out too. - Really? Luckily, it was during the mass. But leaving the table when the lobster is being served, it's a shame! - Your wife will save some for you. - Also it's foggy. It's drizzling too. And I slipped on the railway on my way here. Hurry up, I have to take you to the other dock and leave. The tugs are not here yet. Come in. - Have a drink for me. - I won't refuse. Thanks. - It will keep me in a good mood. - That's right. The party is waiting. - So, no tugs? - No, not yet. What are you doing here? Don't you understand French? Do you speak English? Â¿Te hablo espaÃ±ol? Tu parli italiano? Very well. - I'll inform the Captain. - No! Well! Well! So you are not mute? Please, Sir, don't denounce me. Come. Follow me. Come on. Come with me! Sit down. No. - So I'll call the Captain. - No! I want to go. - So I'll go with you and escort you to the gangway. - No. I seems you have a very bad temper! - Yes. - About time! Sit down. - You said I don't seem mean. - Yes. Now it's a succession of "yes". Sit down. Sit down! For God's sake! So, trying to runaway? You read too many books. Saw too many films. You want to enjoy traveling now. You broke your piggy bank and took your savings. - I have no money. - That's not clever! After fighting with his parents, one is supposed to steal the savings. I have no parents. So where do you come from? That's none of your business. Chatting with you is not very friendly. Do you want to drink something? I'd rather eat. How long have you been hiding in the canoe? Since yesterday evening. - You planned to stay there the whole trip? - No. I'd have showed up in deep seas. You'd have had to keep me on board. The thing is... When one wants to remain unseen, one should not drop his mirror. And one has to retie the tarpaulin. When a young promising officer passes by his infallible eyes notice everything. - Promising? You? - Yes, Miss. Quick-witted, energetic, initiating, well-rated by his superiors... And so forth! - And modest. - Right, I almost forget! Modest. I'll get you something to eat. You're not going to denounce me? You forgot another quality. Extremely discreet! They say I have a nice baritone voice. - Oh, really? - Let me show you! I'll sing The Oxen. I have to big oxen in my cowshed. Two big white oxen, with red markings. The plow was built with maple wood. Here they are! Too bad, we were starting to have fun! - Say, Bernard... - What? Do me a favor and do my shift. - I wanted to go to the cinema. - You can go afterward. The maneuver will only last two hours. You will go to the night screening. Do it for me, pal! - Are you hungry? - No. - But... I have a guest. - Oh, I get it! - Let's go see her. - No, not now. - So you agree? - Yes, but you will buy me a drink! Okay. This is for you then. Excuse me. Why did you lock me up? You tried to runaway? So I was right! I want to leave! You don't know what you want! Let me warn you, the deck is crowded. Help me clear the plates. Hurry up! - Where do I put this? - Over there, on the furniture. Dinner is served. - Tasty! I never ate such a tasty bread! - It's because you are hungry. No, I sweat it's true. Well, that bread is cook on board. Don't eat so fast, please. Drink something. It heats up where it goes! Come in. - What do you want? - Well, I'd like to tell you something. - So, what? - Nothing. - Clever. You saw her, happy? - She's cute. When the maneuver is over, we will drink the bottle. - Who is she? - An oddball, I'll tell you. - Aren't you going? - I am. Do your job. I mean mine. And... give me some time. Are you admiring my mother? She's your mother? Yes, I swear. It's weird, I feel like I know her. And... Do you know this voice? It's Regina! I know her! - You met her? - No, but me and my girls love her. - She's my mother. - You don't look alike. - No, it seems I look like my father. - Why "seem"? He's dead. I never saw him. Or barely. - Do you often see your mother? - No. - Are you mad at her? - Not at her, at the milieu. I hate the people around her and that theatrical atmosphere. That's why I'm a sailor. I love fresh air. She has a nice live, though. Is it true she has two white greyhounds and bath in milk? - Probably, yes. - Tell me more about her. No, I'd rather talk about you and me. Shh, let's listen to the song. - I want to leave? - To go where? - I'll hide in another boat. - Now you know exactly what you want! Goodbye then. Thanks, anyway. It's the least I could do. Don't forget your bag, Miss. By the way, can you swim? No. So it's bothersome. - What's going on? - See by yourself. This boat was supposed to depart tomorrow morning for the Antilles. Counter-order, because of the tide. Do you know what I would do in your situation? It's late, I'd go to sleep. - Here? - Of course! - No, I'll go back to the canoe. - You are afraid, right? - Yes. - Don't be. I'll be the one sleeping in the canoe. Take this. Here is a pajamas. I'll come again say good night. I'd like to ask you something. Go ahead. I'd like to keep the key. Only that! Well, here it is. - You are kind. - Aren't you afraid anymore? So thank me. - Thank you. - Not like that! I mean with your lips, but without a word. Just a little kiss. I'm happy. It's my turn to be happy. No. No. No! Hell's teeth! There's no end to it! I'll miss the dessert, I'll miss the champagne. I'll miss the songs, I'll miss everything. Slowly, slowly, please. One last hour and you will be on your bicycle. Everybody will be drunk when I'll get there. I'll have to rush on Calva to catch up with them. It's not fun. Stop! Stop! My little Denise. Do you think I'm small? You are very kind. Do you come from Le Havre? No, I arrived here yesterday. - So where do you come from? - Far away. We walked for hours. We made a part of the road in a truck, hidden under a tarpaulin. - "We"? - Yes, I was with a friend. She told me she had an uncle in Le Havre who would take care of us. The first thing he did was to call the cops. Are you wanted? I did nothing wrong. I only ran away from the orphanage. Why? Were you too unhappy? Yes. Some like it there, but I was suffocating. - You are a poor child. - Not anymore. So what are you now? I'm... Your wife. What's the matter? Do you regret hiding me? I won't bother you. Nobody will notice me. What is the ship's first stopover? Oh, right. The Antilles. Well... I think. Did you ever go to the Antilles? No. I'm happy. We will discover it together. Discovered by Christoper Columbus, the Antilles were colonized by several European maritime people. France... owns the Guadeloupe and the Martinique. These islands grow... My little Denise, I need to talk to you. I'll make myself inconspicuous. Inconspicuous. It's me! Can I come in? I wanted to... Paul isn't here? I wanted to remind him of his promise. We have a bottle to drink. - A bottle? - We're friend, there's nothing to hide. Let me introduce myself. Bernard Tannier! Get ready, we've arrived! The maneuver is finished. - We're on another dock. - What maneuver? Where are we? Don't be scared, we're still in Le Havre. But dock four instead of two. Don't worry, the tram station is not far away. There also are taxi to ride you home. What's the matter? - Nothing. - Then someone will pick you up later. Are you coming? We were waiting for you. So, shall we go? Let's go. - By the way, what's your name? - Denise. - Will you stay mad at each other? - Denise, I need to talk to you. - Well I don't. - Denise, I behaved badly with you. - Come, I'll explain. - Leave me alone. Bernard! - Leave her alone! - You stay out of this! Denise, what are you going to do now? It's none of your business. Denise! Denise. I was wrong about you. I have behaved like a boor. Listen, I have some money. If it can help you, I... What a night! Leave me alone! Paul! Don't leave me alone, I'm scared! Leave me alone! Paul! Listen My Little. Hug my mother for me and tell her I miss her. - It says so in the letter I gave you. - I'll never dare go to her. You have to! She may seem intimidating but she has not always been famous. She knows what is means to be poor. She will understand. But... Did you tell here we... Don't worry. She is not a bourgeoise, she is open-minded. She will only help you for three months, waiting for my comeback. - Will you send me letters? - Of course, My Little. As often as I will be able to. By the way! You have to change your name, the police are after you. What will we name you? Get on board! Tell me, what is your name? Frankly? Adolf. Why? No reason. No, it's not possible. Canoe. - Why Canoe? - Because you found me in a Canoe. That's true. Denise Canoe, looking after Regina Berry. Get on board! Rouen-Paris, direct. Goodbye, Darling. I'll be back in Le Havre on the 15th June. On the 16th... I'll be in Paris. Trust me. Get on board! Excuse me. Goodbye, sweetheart. One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Number 2, what's wrong with you? - We've been doing this for 2 hours! - Can't we be tired? - Silence! If you were working hard, your legs wouldn't be so floppy. If you don't like the job, just say it. There are many volunteers. Let's start over. She is inexhaustible! Inexhaustibly annoying. And you let her be so? I'm the director, but she is the boss. This is my company but she owes 70% of the shares. You get it? Stop! Stop now. Get your breath back. #2, you can go to the dressing room. Fabien! Fabien! Where is Fabien? You leave me alone, will you? Fabien! - A new dancer for tomorrow. - Very well! - You are firing me? - Absolutely. There are 100.000 workers in Paris earning less than you. I've been a worker myself. I hate fops. - Please be polite? - Enough with you. Get out. - I'm fed up too. - Perfect. Goodbye then! - I won't leave before I tell what I think. - Somewhere else. Fabien, throw her out! I'm leaving, if I can't be tired of such a shrew! She can't listen to her heart, she doesn't have one! She can't think of anything but money! Heartless? Me?! How can she...? After what I did for her! It's true, what would you be without me? Who is filling the theater every night? You or me? To work so hard for so few gratitude...! It's depressing. 30 minutes break. Heartless! Fabien! Fabien, bring some sandwiches. And beers! And chocolate Ã©clairs! - Very well, Madam! - Put it on my tab. Understood. I'm going to my lodge. You'll bring me the ending theme. Come, Chan, come. My dressing gown! - Is it done, Gammette? - We're still waiting, Madam Regina. Let's hope it's a boy. As brave as his father. Let me know when your wife gives birth. - I'll offer her a picture. - Thanks, Madam Regina. Heartless... what a bitch! No one is more sensitive than me! - What are you doing here? - Aren't you rehearsing? - No. Come to my house tomorrow morning. - Morning! What a joke! I'm tired in the morning. Remember I work until 4AM? - Is it working? - Big success. We refused clients again. - You were wrong not to take the deal. - No. - I can't stand what they are doing. - Thanks... And I lent you money, so enough with it. Lent? Plus 15%. You wish I just offered it? This is so bad! Didi! Didi! I'm here, Honey, I'm here. Your dog was so dirty! I don't know where he's been playing. Didi, your first draft is awful. - But I worked so hard! - I asked for a lot of feathers. - And tons of glitz. - We'll exceed the budget! I don't care! Cut down on something. I need feathers and glitz. Understood? - You bought sandwiches for the girls? - Yes, here is the bill. 180Fr. - Where did you buy them? - The cafÃ© nearby. - You told them they were for me? - Yes. 4Fr the sandwich! Tell them that if we don't have a discount of 20% they will hear me. 120Fr. Not one cent more. - Give that to me. - Put this on general expenses. Playing the generous Lady and having the theater pay for it! Shut up! Shut up! - Dry her up. Be careful she doesn't catch a cold. - Yes Dear, yes. - Regina! Shall I play my new songs? - Yes. Regina, a letter from your son on the table. A young girl brought it. She's waiting for you. Well... Come to my place tomorrow at 9AM. - You'll play it while I do my exercises. - Yes, understood. Enough with you, Ricardo. She is so pretty now, isn't she? All pretty and very nice. Don't you think, Ricardo? I like dogs that smell like dogs. - And men that smell like men. - How disgusting! How is Paul doing? He's sending me his conquests now. - How is she? - Very young. Underage. Charming! Send her in. Come in, Miss. Hello Miss. You seem nice. Don't you, My Little? It's curious. I thought he liked tall women. Sit down. You must be tired if you came all the way from Le Havre. - How is my son? - Very fine Madam. He's handsome, isn't he? He will be a great officer. - Are you from Le Havre? - No, Madam. - Were you placed there? - No, Madam. It doesn't matter. If Paul asks for it, I will take care of you. I hope you are hard-working. I can sew. I was making buttonholes in the orphanage. Orphanage? Poor kid. All in all, you want to be a dressmaker. - I don't know. - You should know, my child. You need to have a goal and reach it no matter what. I just want to work. I won't ask for much at the beginning. Working is the most important. I will take care of you. I'm Vice-President of the Foundation for the Raising of Abandoned Children. I'll tell the Committee about you. This will bring you luck. An autographed picture. Thank you, Madam. I promised to tell you what I think of you. Then here I am. You are an old cow. - Get out! - Wait! There is more. You exploit people! The cashier took 40 bucks from my pay for fines! Money for your philanthropy. Madam is generous with we poor people's money! Don't you exploit us enough yet? - Get out! - When I decide so! Shut the fuck up! Chang, get out! - You shouldn't get so upset! - You don't care about anything. But I do have a heart. And I need to feel I am loved. There are only ugly people around me, like Ricardo. Nobody loves me. Sweetie, you are really unjust with me. Nobody! Only my baby. Don't you love your mistress? Come, Baby. Don't you love your mistress? Don't you love her? Oh, you are here. Yes, Madam. - I'm leaving. - No! You wanted a job, I'll give you one here. Clara! - I don't know if... - Don't worry. Clara! Take care of her and give her new clothes. - Give her one of my dresses. - They are for your mother. You can take one! You're a dressmaker, make it fit you. - She can make two dresses with this! - Madam, how can I thank you? - You too, will say I am an old cow. - No, Madam. Never! One needs to be a philosopher and make his own happiness. - Do you have money? - Well, I... Go now. Clara, take care of her. I have to work now. Now I recognize you, pretty Regi! Very choleric but with a heart this big! You are one of us for sure. Regina is Paris! Well you have a cute little face. I have a job for you. - In your cabaret? - Yes, as a barmaid. - I'd prefer something else. - It's not tiring, you know. You dance, drink a little, and make people drink. And you have good opportunities to meet a rich man. Like Lucie did. - The blonde one? A bit chubby? - Yes. Now she leads her own band. Now she comes back to show off, as a client! This is the place. Yes. This is your place. You will prepare yourself here. A new one? That was quick. You thought you were irreplaceable? - Who is she? - A girl sent by Regina's son. Oh, sorry! She's family! Aren't you disgusted? If the son is like the mother he must be awful. You'll go far, you're on the right path. Leave her alone. Miss, I'm innocent. I was just looking for a job. Stop it. Oh, you have a picture too! Did she sell it 10 bucks? For her charity? - No, she gave it to me. - My goodness! It's good to be family. Well, well! She's crying now. Excuse me. I didn't mean to hurt you. Don't cry. I didn't know you were so sensitive. Come on. Can you dance? No. I will be do walk-on parts. I'm afraid, I don't know how to use makeup. Don't worry, the girls will teach you. - Aren't you mad at me? - No, kid! Let me buy you a coffee. You're one of the girls, you deserve it! Do you stay at the hotel? I don't know, I just got in Paris. I'll introduce you to the city. Come. - Goodbye girls! - Bye! Who are you? I should be the one asking. - This is my place. - Police. I'm the Snail. Stop kidding. Your name. Count of Bourgogne. I advise you not to act dumb. I give you my gentleman's word, I'm the Count of Bourgogne. And that is why my nickname is the Snail. And I won't hide that in this world that makes my life a struggle I chose irony over anonymity. So the count is hiding in the shell. Funny, isn't it? Your papers. What are these things? This is an advertisement I am not dissatisfied with. I will put these pretty girls at the cabaret's entrance. What do you think of them? By the way, why are you here? Where is Ricardo? It's strange to answer to a question with another question. I don't know, gentleman! Now the collar. Naturally, it's dirty! - I can give you another dress. - No! You know I can only wear this one for my charity. Give it to me. I'll wash and iron it. It will be done in 10 minute. Regina my love, trust my ironing. - Say. - Hmm? - The Pope's son, what time'll he be here? - Not before four. You will be at the 4th table, near the flowers, right? Yes. Do you enjoy being a countess that much? Don't you get it? I don't want him to marry me. I want him to acknowledge the child. - Paul called for his Dad? - No. I just want him to have one. A good one. A good-looking one. If I buy a name for my son, I want it to have an aristocratic particle and a crown. - You have information about that count? - Yes. Excellent, good family. But penniless. He lives in province. - He'll go back there when he gets the papers. - With his 100 bills. 80. He will do it for 80. - It's good money just for a signature. - So how will your son be named? Parmelan! The young Count of Parmelan. Not bad for the son of a zinc worker. Too bad the zinc worker committed suicide because of you before he acknowledged Paul. This will do. Hey, you! You could at least remove your shoes! And don't throw your cigarette butts on the carpets, they are precious. Dear Regina, I met the Minister yesterday. It's plausible that one day a little ribbon will find its way to your dress! Madam, that would be too much! - Hello! Hello! - Hello! Hello, sorry. Dear! Dear! What a story! - Is he refusing? - No, he wants 100.000. - Offer him 90.000, not one more. - Very well. Hello! Excuse me Sir, Ms. Regina's table please. - This way. - Thank you. - - Ms. Regina? - Herself. I come from Ricardo's. His place was requisitioned, he will be arrested. - What? - Astounding. What do you mean? Because drugs have been found. What an idiot! Do you know him well? I'm the Secretary-General of Frinet, you must have heard about me. The Snail. Count of Bourgogne. My friend, do you have change for 1.000 Fr? - I never give change you know. - Really? I'll do the same. What a surprise! Edouard! Madam de Lantenac. - You are still so young. - You haven't changed either, Count. - We haven't seen you for ages! - I have retired in the countryside. Come here, there is a shooting range! - Come! Come! - Excuse me. How are you doing, dear Count? This guys is amazing! Regina, I talked to the count. He is insatiable, he wants 110.000 now. I don't care, I have found a better one. Count of Bourgogne. I like him. He will be a great father for Paul. Take care of him. But check his criminal record first. Madam Regina, a letter for you to give to Ms. Canoe. I know what it is, thanks. No thing for me? No, Madam. - It's Paul. - Where is your son now? The stamp is from Lisbon. - I adore love letters. - Me too. Here again, he has has stupid problems. The girl ran away from an orphanage and he's taking care of her. - Do you realize? Corruption of a minor! - My dear, more problems for you! The boy is like his father, too sentimental. - You mean the Count of Bourgogne? - No, the zinc worker! Shut up! - Ginette, open up, I need to talk to you! - I'm bathing, I'll meet you in 5 minutes! What is it? Ginette, I knocked on your door to borrow some money. - The boss asked that I pay my bill. - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. It's hard to live with the 800Fr I earn. - I told you that Regina exploits people! - Don't start again. - Don't you think I could work for Frinet? - Certainly not. All you have to do is sing and drink champagne, it's an easy job. You forgot you have to let people grope you. Drink when you are not thirsty. Listen to filthy things and pretend ugly is handsome. To name but a few... No, I'll introduce you to The Snail to do modeling. - It's easy and paid 200 buck. - You are so good, Ginette! What would I do without you? Still no news from Paul? No. He was supposed to send me a letter from Lisbon. Maybe he didn't have time. Or the letter got lost. - Ride up your skirt! - It's embarrassing. You show more when you dance. - It's different. - Come on. Don't be childish. She looks like Regina! It's her. How funny! She looks so dumb! The bitch had a nice body. - Am I interrupting? - I was working, I didn't see you. I wanted to take you by surprise. - It's funnier! - We are done by the way. She is one of your girls, I think, she works in your place. Yes, yes, she is my protÃ©gÃ©e. But... I reproach her for the bad company she has. Are you talking about me. I'd better go or I'll kick up a fuss. Come with me. Hurry up! Come back another day, I'll shoot you two together, you know? We don't do that. Goodbye. These pre-war pictures are funny! Look at the underwear and the swimming suit! Let me show you my little laboratory. I know this one! Mercedes. Nice bust. She had great breasts. She is a dresser for the Folies now. I set up a darkroom in my kitchen. The bride's negligee! It's me! Finally I see it! - I'm not ashamed of my past. - Actually it's a present for you. I won't refuse it. It's true. I did modeling with negligees. I removed many scalloped trousers, I won't deny it. And the way I opened the front of my dress! These were good times. When this picture was taken I was pregnant with Paul. Nobody noticed before the fifth month. The thing is I really needed to work. I didn't want people to notice. I was dancing at the Bouffes Du Nord! I was the star of the show! Anyway... I didn't come to remind you of my past. What can I do for you, dear Madam? A lot. It's about my son. Do you want me to train him to become a photograph? Oh, no. No. I didn't come to meet the Snail but the count of Bourgogne. - It's embarrassing. - Please go ahead. It doesn't matter. - I have a proposition. - Yes? He's being picky but he will accept. I like the old chap. He is overripe but distinguished. With better clothes he will be a very suitable father for Paul. - What are you thinking about? - Denise. Paul mustn't see her again. - Is he very attached to her? - He sent another letter yesterday. The boy have scruples, he is loyal. I'm proud of that, but... I don't want him to think he is in love and let him ruin his life. - Throw her away. - Oh, that would not be nice. If I were you, since she ran away from an orphanage, I know what I would do. â™ª In the river â™ª â™ª Every passerby besmirch me â™ª â™ª In the river â™ª â™ª My heart is crawling in the mud â™ª â™ª I shudder â™ª â™ª When I'm being looked at â™ª â™ª In the beam â™ª â™ª Of Pallid lights â™ª â™ª In the river â™ª â™ª My misfortune is dragged away â™ª - Do it discreetly. - Don't worry, just point her out. The third on the left. â™ª I will end up â™ª â™ª On a moonless night â™ª - What do you want? - Put your clothes back on, Madam is here. No! No! No! Leave me alone! â™ª In the river â™ª Leave me alone. I don't want to go with her! Leave me alone! - Madam, thanks for our oeuvre. - No. Put it on the child's account. - And promise me she won't be punish. - Very well Madam. And don't let her know... I called you. Madam, is was a laudable decision. You saved her from a dangerous world. She is an inattentive, reckless girl. No humbug, Director. I know I played a dirty trick. But I had to. I would do anything for my son. Dinar tidied up the place. It was a student's room, now it's a sailor's room. Mom, you know I'm not a sailor anymore. I took a career break. What? You abandon your career? I don't know yet. It will depend on many things. We will talk about all this later. You felt a bit depressed. Didn't you? I will heal you, my little Paul. You will leave with me. We will be like two lovers. I'm really happy to see you, you know. - You got taller again. - You say so every time you see me. I swear you got taller! It's easy, I made a mark. Let's compare. That idiot of a Dinar covered them all. I started marking when you were six. Too bad, I didn't tell him to keep them. It's natural, Mom. You have so much work to do! And me? How do you think I am? Not too... old? Wonderful! And a bit blonder, I think. Right? - You dislike it? - No. No, but if your hair was whiter, your face may be sweeter, more natural. Actually the white ones are underneath. But don't tell nobody! Your eyes are so beautiful! I bet you seduced may girls during your cruise! No. No? No. But Mom, how did they find her? You couldn't do anything to stop them? What? Oh, the little girl? You still think of her? Tell me, my Little, you didn't tell me she ran away from the orphanage. I was very surprised when they came to take her. I has promised Denise I would save her. Listen, Little Paul. Don't make any mistake. You deluded yourself in the sea, thinking of that girl. - She's not worth it. - How do you know? I saw her! - She had very bad company. - Blame on you! I entrusted you with her. You think I'm your chicks' nurse? Denise is not like that! I seduced her, I have to make amend for it. Where did you learn to speak like that? Not with me, you sound like Jean Genet! - Girls like Denise are all over the river! - Shut up. - Where are you going? - To find her. Sir, I can't understand your insistence. Or I understand it too well. I think a young officer has better things to do than chasing a girl. Do you think it's more charitable to lock her up and stop her from living? Denise is absolutely not locked up. But she has to remain with us until her majority. Unless she is marrying. But I don't feel like I'm talking to her fiancÃ©. - Why not? - In this case come back with your father. He has to officially ask for her hand. - That's the only way to let her go. - Madam, I'm begging you. Let me talk to her, just a few minutes. You can stay and listen to our conversation. Madam... Denise is not here. She ran away, again. - How? - At the train station, she found a way. She is incorrigible. I doubt she deserves the love you have for her. There is no way insisting, unaccompanied women can't go in. I want to see my friend, she dances here. I believe you but you have to be accompanied. Will you accept me as your dance partner? - Can I go in with this gentleman? - Sure. - Then I'll accept. - Let's go. What a surprise! - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for Ginette. Ginette? Come with me. So you dressed up as wind again. What? I mean you ran away again. Mister Ricardo, please, where is Ginette? Ginette went to the countryside for a couple of days. What will become of me? - Why do you want to see Ginette? - Ginette is my friend, she would help me. She would hide me, I know they will come again. No they won't! Ricardo is not a rat. I will take care of you. Is that you, Regina? I have something to tell you. The little one arrested at the Folies. She's back in Paris. - What are you saying? - Yes. I know where she is. She is with Frinet. She is looking for Ginette. - I thought it'd interest you. - Of course it does. - So? - Don't give me your "so". I don't want the police to interfere. They'll take her back to the orphanage and Paul will marry her. - I'll take care of her then. - What will you do? I won't hurt the kid, don't worry. But Paul won't see her again. If he sees her again, He won't wont want to marry her anymore. And Frinet show up naked. All naked! Bravo! Bravo! But she was immediately acquitted. And the judges, quite congested, told her... Charming Frinet, you can put your clothes back on. How can we not understand the judges? In such a situation, it is difficult "reFRaINET" from being seduced! Bravo! Very good. Bravo again! I know that girl. She worked at the Folies. The Folies? She is a beginner from Lyon. - It's quite obvious. - Strange. She is charming, anyway. Congratulations. You are a sly little fox! The kid has problems with her family. So I take care of her. I'll be quiet as the grave. - Will you offer ma a drink, handsome? - It will be my pleasure. Oh, hello! We meet again! Care for a drink with me? Oh, the Snail! No, I am waited over there. - Are you a resident here? - Yes, in the meantime. - Waiting for what? - A boat. A boat? Have a seat. Waiting for a boat? Here? I'm waiting for a boat to get to Le Havre. You may very well miss it. I know when it will arrive. I'll go for it that day. The boat? No, the man on board. I see. A very little boat. They are many on board, but I only care for one man. - He is your lover, I guess. - Yes. My first one. What if he is not on board? I don't know what I would do. - Are you faithful to your lover? - Of course. Here? You must be some kind of heroin. A Saint! - I arrived here a few days ago. - Oh, that's why. So Mr. Ricardo is training you. He is very kind with me. I'm all alone in Paris. He takes care of me, waiting for Ginette to come back. - Do you know where Ginette is? - In the countryside. No. She is in prison. She was arrested by the Vice Squad. Impossible! It's no big deal. She will be out in a few days with her card. It will let her do a job in an official way. One needs a card to dance? Poor little one, where do you come from? So, Fanny, how is your kid? - Not well. Have you seen a doctor? - Yes. He looked at the kid. And as he was leaving he told me... "My dear, he is very ill." - Maybe he was wrong. - No. He's a lost cause. I'm telling you. - Well I'm waiting for somebody, too. - Here? Not exactly. I'm waiting for her child. I'm going to be a father. - At your age? - But! - When I'll tell the girls! - No, keep it for you. Aren't you happy? - So you are married! - No. Even so... By the way, I'll will acknowledge the child. - Good. - Isn't it? What do you prefer? A boy or a girl? It's a boy. You're waiting for him but you already know? He's a big boy. He has done his military service already. - You're making fun of me. - Not at all. I'll acknowledge him but I don't know him. - But he knows you? - Not at all, we never met. - Strange story. - Yes. I shall also add that this boy that I don't know and am going to acknowledge is not actually my son. - So why acknowledge him? - One has to earn a living. Will this boy be happy to have a father? I wonder. His real father was a poor but good man. I hope he doesn't know much about him so he won't be disappointed. Aren't you a good man, Mister Snail? I'm an ignoble human being, my poor little girl. I'm demoted, perverted and wrecked. Here you are. I told Denise you were in the countryside. There were not many trees in that countryside. - But there were a lot of shadow. - You'll be more prudent next time. I don't care. - We are taking Fanny. - Hello Ginette! - You look great. - You don't, old girl. - We'll I see you later? - No, I'm going with these gentlemen. Pay the bill to the maÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel. Jean! Take care of them. We want her for the night. - How is her child doing? - I heard there is no hope. Darling! I'm so happy to see you. You are so beautiful. - Hello, my dear. - Kids, let's celebrate! - Let me offer you a drink! - Congratulations! So, how was your trip to the countryside? Very well, thank you. Denise, let's dance tango. I haven't danced in a while. A charming girl, this Ginette. Yes, she's a regular. And very hard-working. Inaudible I didn't know. You told me I could manage with my tips on drinks. Yes, but I'm strong, I can drink. I drink as much as a man. Don't lie to me, I know where you were. What? You know? I hired Denise as a dancer. Her private life is none of my business. First of all, dear Ricardo, we are what is called an abject bastard. Hey, the Snail, you had too much champagne. An abominable rascal, a vile women-exploiter. - If I wasn't patient I'd throw you out. - I don't care at all! I will soon receive a great amount of money that will allow me to be no more a powerless and outraged witness of your abominable traffic. I do understand your indignation, dear Count. Please... I'm not the Count of Bourgogne in this degrading place. I'm the Snail. Yes, but it's the Count that does traffic with his name and acknowledge a child. Ricardo, you are right. I am a swine. I'm a shame for my ancestors. I let the son of a zinc worker be a member of our illustrious family. It's vile. It's low. Emile, clear the champagne and give a frozen coffee to this gentleman. Where is Denise? I... - I put her in a cab. - Why? I don't want her to work here. You don't? I don't want you to turn her into a whore! Come to my office. This is what you get for meddling in things that are none of your business. She is my friend. She's not dumb. And... you have no papers? I lost them. What a shame. I can't help you without official papers. People try to trick us so often we have to be careful. - I understand. - And... Where do you live? At the hotel. I'm sorry, we don't help girls that live in hotels. I have no furniture, where would I live? My dear, I see tons of girls like you. Investigations almost always show deplorable things. We work out of kindness, but we are no fools. No papers, no certificate, no residence, no information on your past... I'm sorry. We can't do anything. Unemployment is decreasing. Now, who wants a job has a job. All of you, go to La Cotelette! Lunch or diner: 12 Francs 50. Here! Look at your picture! You should go back to the Snail. He has stopped shooting. Oh, right, he inherited! Now the Snail is wearing astonishing tuxedos! - What about cinema? - I've been an extra twice. When I saw what was left of my fee after my meal, the trip and the percentage... What about your Paul? Still no news? He was supposed to send me letter via his mother. I don't dare asking. If I go for the letters, she will denounce me. Between us, Little Denise, Don't trust him. Your sailor. Don't say that, Ginette! He's my reason for living. Believe me. Men are all egoists. We are here to give them pleasure. As soon as you give them troubles or remorse... They get ride of you. Not Paul! He will be in Le Havre on Saturday, he promised I hope so, but you have to survive in the meantime. Find money for the trip. I shouldn't have told you to leave Frinet. At least you had food. I was drinking too much. Do you want me to talk to Ricardo? He will hire you back. And I'll be able to watch you, waiting for him to come back. Ginette, you are such a good friend! But I have to ask you something. Wait until Saturday. He will be back and I will repay you. I got it. I'll lend you money for the trip. Come downstairs, I'll buy you a sandwich. Thanks, but Iâ€™d rather stay here. When I think about him, I forget I'm hungry. Only four days left. Goodbye, sweetheart. I'll go to work. I'll bring you a chicken wing. If I can. Paul... Paul, my Paul! Who is it? It's about the bill. Tell me, this is the Trinidad, right? No, the Trinidad arrived late at night. It's over there. Mister Paul Berry. Mister Paul Berry! He left the boat in Santos, took a leave and came back to Paris one month ago. I love traveling. I'd have enjoyed being a sailor. Excuse me. Me too! The thing is I'm seasick. - When will you leave again? - Soon. A boat is being rearmed. I shall be part of its commandment. Nice. With such a nice face, one could not get bored. The sleeve should be higher. You are right, Madam. Dear friends, I keep thinking this cardigan gives me a too severe look. This is a grave situation. You must look serious. We are done. I'll let you remove the trousers, Sir. A jacket with a black border would have suited me. No! The day Paul sees you for the first time I want you to be very chic. I assure you that a black bordered jacket would have let me be a respectable father. - And I'd have reused it many times. - Who's paying the tailor? I am! So let me choose what I like. By the way, society people wear cardigans to go to the theater. Dear friend, excuse me, but I have to remove my trousers. Don't mind me. Have you thought of what you will tell your son when you meet him? I re-read on this occasion The Natural Son, by Dumas fils. Don't forget it's tomorrow, for lunch. In my arms, my child! I did you many wrongs. I'll be happy to repair them, on the threshold of my great age. What do you think? You don't look that old. And speak more naturally. Let's do it again. In my arms, my son! - And forgive... - Don't ask for forgiveness. You're right, you're right. In my arms, my son! Are you coming, Denise? Your friend can definitely drink. Is she like this every night? Recently, yes. - Wasn't she a dancer? - Now she's a whore. - It pays more. - Oh come on! Enough with your questions! All you need to know is all the clients are jerks. Including sailors, you get it? I'm not a sailor, I'm an accountant. Why do you say that? I feel a bit better. You will ruin your stomach living like this, Little Denise. - Are you coming? - Yes, I'm coming. One moment. - Come here. - Sit on my knees. - No! No! No! - Don't pussyfoot! Just one little glass to celebrate your victory. She must kiss us all! Is this young lady still here? Yes, but... she is busy. Here is the gentleman who took the picture. You like this kind of pictures? No, I just want to meet the girl. Nice little girl, isn't she? A moving face. - Barely 18. - What is she doing here? What do you think she is doing here? - Don't you know the place? - No. - No? It's the first time you come here? - Yes. Well if you really want her it's 50 Fr. Yes. The maÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel will help you. You cheaters! You said on the cheek! Oh, Paul! You? Here? What a surprise! I'm so drunk! - I'm so drunk! - Get lost. It's all you have to say? It's not nice. Aren't you ashamed? Get lost? No, I'm too exhausted! Hey, the Snail! I'm taking care of the customers and he tells me to get lost. You are not here to make a scandal, I hope. - Shut up, old man! - Do you know who you are talking to? - Yes, an old pervert! - Mind you manners! Don't you two start a fight! The Snail is kind. Ginette is kind too. Oh, she left. Ricardo is kind too! Only you are mean. I'm so thirsty. Waiter, a whiskey! What will you have, Darling? - Nothing. - Two whiskeys! I'll drink for you. Enough! Can't you see she drank too much already? - Stop! Throw him out! - I'll throw you out, old pervert! Sir, you are going too far! Assassin! - He's Regina's son, don't hurt him. - Yes Sir. - Sir! Sir, are you taking this lady? - Yes I am. How much is it? Pay 100 Fr and I can spend the night with you, darling. Here are your 100 Fr! I saw you. When there are troubles, you run away. - And you let him go just like this. - He is Regina's son. His son? This little brute? God dammit! Paul... Don't hate me. Don't look at me. I'm so ugly. I look like a whore. I am so ashamed. I waited for you so long! I got by until your return. But in Le Havre... You were not there. So, you understand... I gave in. Why keep fighting when you would not come back? And here you are. I'd rather... never see you again. You can't love me anymore. It's over. It's over. Shut up. I'm a barmaid there. The clients must drink so I drink too. I drank do much! I was so miserable. I couldn't be unhappy. Clients don't like that. And... I mean... Clients often took you out? No! Paul! I'm not what you think! I swear, Paul! You won't believe me. You can't believe me. Shut up. Shut up, My Little. - Believe me, Paul. - Have some rest. We will talk tomorrow. Paul, tell me you are not mad at me. Tell me you still love me! I don't know anymore. Denise! My poor little one. Calm down. Don't cry. - Where is he? He's late. - Who? Your son? So, his father. I told him to come early to rehearse. Also I wanted to check his clothes. Mom! No! Leave some cake for the guests. She ate all the olives too! - You have become impossible! - I'm hungry! - Can't you wait a bit? - I'm used to have lunch exactly at noon! - By the way what's for lunch? - You will see. Take it back to the kitchen and fill it again. And don't take it back until we ask for it. I'll check how things are going. She always has the fidgets! She has to run. She has to give orders. She has to do so and so. Between us, I think this ceremony is grotesque. What ceremony? This story about making the Count of Bourgogne my grand-son's father. In my arms, my son! I won't go! He will give me another black eye! Listen, little Lucette. You will go to the lodge and ask your mother to call someone for me. Tell her I'm sorry but I'm in bed with a bad fever. No! No! Don't say anything! Go open the door. Go! Come on, dear! We're waiting for you! Regina is very mad! Don't tell me. I have a very bad fever. - Take some pills and get up. - Get up? What a good joke! I can't stand up. Look! I got up at night and fell on a furniture. No... Come on, my fellow Bourgignon. You have to come, it's a catastrophe. Impossible. The paternity itself gave me this fever. I can't sleep at night. How could I outwit such a good boy? I can't play with his noble feelings. This is too much for me. It's unworthy of my name, my rank. It's unworthy of Regina, a great artist. My friend, it's too late for remorse. You acknowledged him yesterday at the city hall. You are his legal father. There is nothing to be done. And don't forget you were paid good money. You'll have to give it back. Give it back? I'm coming with you! Good. You don't look well, my little Paul. - Are you ill? - No Mom, it's just I couldn't sleep. You were out all night! - It's of your age. - Sure. Where did you go? Frinet. - Do you know who I saw there? - No I don't. Denise. I told you she were not a decent girl. Who sent her there? Your Ricardo, probably. Listen, my little Paul. Let's talk about this later. Remember your father is coming. He's an honorable old man. He should not hear about this. Of course, you will notice your face doesn't look like his. He is not really a pretty man. The colonies ruined his appearance. - He went to the colonies? - He stayed there for years! He was hunting wild animals. He is a renowned shooter. He is an artist also. Well... He enjoys art. I mean he is a society people. So he felt like acknowledging me all of a sudden? Well... When we separated... we were a baby and he wanted to acknowledge you. But I was too proud and... I didn't accept it. I was wrong. Then years went by... And we met again. It was the only solution. You needed a name! Aren't you a bit moved? A father... As a teenager, I was jealous of my friends for having one. I missed a father so bad. - Br happy now, he will be here. - It's too late. I used to miss him, but now he will be a nuisance. You now, this sudden father is quite late. - I'm very moved. - Will you have some Porto? - Yes, please. - Very well. - I'll have another one too, Sir. - Here you are. - How will he react? - Very well. He will be very happy. - A father from heaven! - I said I want another one, Dinar! Very well! Oh my God! Paul... Your father. In my arms, my son! This is my father?! That takes the cake! The photographer! You swine! You macaque! Your left eye is jealous. Let's turn it black too! Have you gone insane? Forget it, Madam. I'm delighted. Our child is overcome with emotion. - You mean disgust. - He's your father. - Well too bad! - Excuse me, my friend. Please let us speak man to man. This is an awful misunderstanding. Go that way. That was a success! Mom, please! Lunch will be delayed again now! Take this. You are even viler than I thought. You acknowledged me for money! That was it... Sell my name or sell my small country house. I decided to sell my name. I knew you were worthy of it. You and my mother are disgusting. You buy me a father and throw my lover in the river! - Denise? You love Denise? - Yes, I love Denise! I love a girl, yes! Denise is a human being. I won't allow my son to insult this innocent girl! I know her story, by the way. She was seduced by a boor! He abandoned her right after! At least that's what she thinks. Paul, answer me frankly. - Do you love Denise? - Yes, I love Denise. Congratulations! You are a true Bourgogne! By the way you know our motto: "Love, always!" - I'll help you. - I don't need help. You're her child. Do you think your mother will give up easily? She wants to separate you and Denise. I'll protect you. You're betraying her already? She paid me to acknowledge you. Now that I have a son, I want nothing but his happiness. It's only natural. - Who did you call in Paris, yesterday? - I told you, Ginette. - It's not true. - I swear it is. What was so urgent? Ginette is my friend. I gave her some news. And whose news did she give you? You're an idiot. You miss Frinet. You want to go back there. Poor Paul, you like hurting me. - Let's have a toast! - I won't refuse! Cheers! - Here are the kids. - Right on time! The Count is paying us drinks. - What will you have? - I will have a little Pernod. No. No alcohol. - It will make you sick. - A little Pernod can't hurt nobody. My last kid is five. He drinks one every Sunday! He drinks like a man already! Let's go home. How could an aperitif hurt me? - Can't you stop drinking? - Losing bad habits is not easy. I do everything I can, I swear. I do more efforts than you do. Is living with me an effort? You could try to be nicer instead of torturing the two of us. When I think of all these men holding you, kissing you... Enough! Shut up. I try to forget and you keep repeating it. - I'm sorry Denise! - We could be happy. You keep hurting us! Denise! Denise. The young lady is crying again. - Yes. It's her nerves... - Maybe the countryside's not helping her. She will probably eat alone in her room. - Just like yesterday. - Like yesterday, yes. Is Paul here? Your police is well informed. - Ginette told Ricardo, he told me. - Women and secrets... Why did you allowed the elopement? Dear friend, the Bourgogne's motto is "Love, always!" I didn't come here to laugh, Snail! Here I am the Count. Anyway... You're against me. No, I would not say so. I certainly don't appreciate your manners. But I understand your feelings. I tried to explain them to Paul yesterday. What does he think of me? He is judging you very severely. And I'm weighing my words. Let me talk to him. Will he want to listen to you? Tell him I came with no reproach and no fuss. I want to see him. Kiss him. I don't want him to hate me! And I am sure some explanations from us will... ease things. Of course, my friend! Let your heart speak! - Go then. - Yes. Wait a minute. Paul. You mother is here and wants to talk to you. - Did you ask her to come? - No. - Is hurt maternal love hurting? - She is very unhappy. Aren't I? I don't want to see her! I'll leave and come back when she goes. No! Come on, please. Be reasonable. - Where is he? - On the doorstep. I'll leave by the kitchen. I know you will welcome her. I won't dine here tonight! So what? He ran away so as not to see you. And the little one? - You want to see her? - Yes. - I wonder if I should... - Where is she? In her room. I'll stay downstairs, let me tell you! No, leave me alone, I'm tired. So tired. Come in if you want, the door is not locked. You? Paul is not here. - It's you I want to see. - I have nothing to tell you. It wouldn't be useless the two of us have sincere explanations. Sincere? How convenient! See it as a joke if you prefer. But to make Regina angry when she has decided to be calm... Let me tell you, that won't be an easy things. What do you want? My son. He's not really mine It will be easy to take him back. I'm experienced. All the women that cannot seduce anymore are. If you say so, my little. Still... the two of you can't be happy together. It's your fault. You denounced me, didn't you? Yes. You liked me working for Frinet, it was a good way of separating us. That was your plan. Well you were wrong. Really? Your son loves me. Nothing is stronger than his love for me. So why are you crying? Because he is unhappy. You planned a good scheme. You know nothing about life. If he really loved you, he would have forgiven you. Forgive what? I did nothing wrong. I remained faithful to him. He will never believe it. He will never forget the place he found you in. You are a monster! You have no feelings, no goodness. You are a monster. Sure, keep talking. You have been as unhappy as I am. You were in the river too! - There has been many men in your life. - Enough. My life was often difficult. Not always shining, I admit. But my son was my excuse. I wanted him to have... a beautiful life. A decent life. Did I do all this for him to marry a vulgar barmaid? Why don't you get me arrested then? I've had enough of you! - Call the police! - Enough! Enough with the shouting. Close the door. Come here. Listen to me. What will become of him, with you? He will have to renounce to his career. His life will be a mess. Denise... If you really love him, and I'm sure you do! I'm sure you are a brave little girl. You must give in. - Give him back to me. - And what about me? What about me? - You will forget. - Never! What you are doing now is bad. It's... It's tough, I know. It ill be very painful. But this is about Paul's future. Denise... My little Denise. Leave him to me. Leave him... to his Mom. Go away. Be assured, I'll leave him. Go away. Go away! - What will you tell him? - It's my problem. Go away! Go away now! Well, my little! I'd rather disappear. Are you crazy? Why fight? She is stronger. Paul can't be happy with me. It's totally wrong! This is only a crisis, things will get better. No, I'd rather go. Where to? I don't care at all. To the orphanage. Have some rest. We will talk later. No, give me a hand. I shall go now, while I have the strength. Wait for Paul to come back, at least. No, I can't see him anymore. You will tell him. I won't tell anything! - You want to go back to the orphanage? - Yes. Well this is totally dumb! If you really made up your mind, you won't go alone, I'm coming with you. Here is one thing. As soon as you appear, everybody disappears. You came to the countryside, Denise ran away. - Your father was there too. - Don't try to trick me. You can't help but mess things up. Everything you touch becomes dirty. Your milieu, Dinar, Ricardo, the others! You think I forgot what I saw as a kid? - Remember the tenderness. - Do you know why I became a sailor? No! On the contrary. You didn't notice anything. I was running away. Running away from you, and the others. Believe me, you should have pity and feel bad for that poor girl. Don't pretend you have any kind of moral. Women like Denise and me can't make a man happy. You and her have nothing in common. You sacrificed everything for your career. Why does everybody keep criticizing my career and my wealth? If you became an officer, it's thanks to my career. And my iron will. For you... I wish you were poor. The money I owe comes from my own work. Poor... I was once. More than you seem to think. At the hospital when you were born. Be assured, I won't cost you one more cent, I won't bother you anymore. I'm leaving. What do you mean, Paul? If you go... What will become of me? My life will be over. - I'm not worried, you will son forget me. - No, Paul! Listen to me. Don't abandon me. If you want to see her again... I will agree. But... Don't leave me. Don't abandon your old Mom. I loved you so much, you know. So much... - Excuse me. - It's good you're here. Paul wants to leave. Help me! - This is no time to leave. - And Denise? Denise? She is here! Paul... I'm saying this seriously, solemnly. You can trust her. You can't reproach her anything. She still the little girl you found hidden in a canoe. Denise... You didn't let her go back to the orphanage. My friend, corruption of a minor, at my age? It's would be too grave. I did take her to the orphanage, you see. - Yes? - And once in front of the director... I asked her hand for our son. You did that? That was the best thing to do! At last my paternity proved to be useful. I won't let it happen. Of course you will. The youth is always right! My heart is still twenty. By the way I arranged everything. You'll get to play the hero. Enough, stop. I informed the press already. - What? - Yes. Here is the first page. I think there is a great picture of Regina and a wonderful article. Let me see. Love match. Regina was the fairy godmother. Hello? Hello? These are the journalists. - On the contrary, come upstairs! - I don't want to see nobody! She says she will be delighted to give an interview. Well, well, well. You are a maestro. Edouard... I don't know if I'm a maestro. But I think no impresario can match me. Honey, I'm so happy for you! This story is such a good advertisement! You can't imagine! - I will allow the journalists in. - Wait, let me redo my makeup. - Edouard, what should I say? - Anything! Tell them what you want to say. Come in, ladies and gentlemen. Madam, we'd like to hear your declaration. Is it true you will give the orphan a dowry? I will answer. One question at a time. This is a very simple story. It's very moving, very human and very morale. One night, Regina, after... He's amazing. He is going to cry. He is someone! Say, Regina. You should marry him. That would be the peak of your career. I heard his father's castle is to sell. Buy it for a good price. A garden party with the countess! Regina, I swear! It ill be impressive. ...his son. Our son! Paul Edouard AmÃ©dÃ©e de Bourgogne. Fell in love with the girl. And Regina... didn't care for social decorum. The poverty of that kid... actually united these kids! I'm the daughter of the people. To me, love is sacred! The kids were in love, I couldn't say no. My only pleasure is... to make people happy. I always said so! Regina's heart is this big! - Regina, a picture! - Sure, but with Edouard! Certainly! And I will be on your knees, as always. Honey, I'm so happy for you! It gives me palpitations. - Isn't it better like this? - Edouard, I like you. We were made to be with each other. Attention! Are you ready? Don't move! Here we are. - Where are the kids? - Yes, our little ones! - Let's take a picture with the kids. - Yes, I will be in the center. One second, I will call the kids. P... Paul! Denise! Paul Denise! Paul? Denise? Paul? Denise? Paul! Denise? Hey, how long will you stay here? Lovebirds, where are you going? Montmartre? Montparnasse? No way! Anything but there! - Give us fresh air. - Can we go to Le Havre? Le Havre? I was born there! So was our love. The end Subtitles: tadanobu@KG
