This place is so beautiful! So many dragons! It's this palace something else? I've never seen something like this. The palace is okay, but what about the kitchen? There are dragons everywhere, how come? Because the Emperor belongs to the Dragon Clan. Its believed that his ancestors are blessed with a power of The MahaYang Dragon ...for the welfare of China. Oh! Feed something to your guest first... ...and then you can take us on a tour where ever you like. So many pictures... Yes, they are beautiful. Who are these people, Ming? This is the Emperor's grandfather. This is his father. This is the Emperor. And this is Kia. What kind of a picture is this? Why is there a dragon with Kia in it? This is the MahaYang Dragon... He's our God! Oh! And Kia has a special connection with him. What? Yes, on Kia's first birthday a miracle occurred in the sky. The MahaYang Dragon himself descended down upon us. The Protector of China, the fire-wielding one. Everyone got an opportunity to see. The MahaYang Dragon. There was a bright ball of Divine Fireball on his chest... ...and his entire body was glowing brightly. He blessed Kia with a special protective symbol. Since then everyone believes that Kia shares a special bond with the dragon. Such miracles happen only once in a hundred years. That's why Kia is the Light of China. Wow! And Ming's best friend too! Yes! Princess! Not Princess, call me Kia. Ming's friends are my friends too. And all my friends just call me Kia. And we offer laddoos to all our friends. Ooh... Laddoos! You too, my friend!

Because yesterday was just the beginning. Today is going to be an interesting display. The Five Obstacle Tower? Meaning? Meaning Fire... Water... Iron... Soil and Wood A dangerous web made of five elements Whoever clears through these obstacles and brings the flag back... ...will be the winner of this round. Thank goodness, I got disqualified in the first round. [BELL TOLLING] Let's begin Round 2 of the Dragon Competition Boss! The first competitor has managed to climb the tower. Yay! Laddo warrior! The warriors are scaling up the tower one after the other but it won't be easy staying up there. The Five Obstacle Tower will give them a tough competition! [THUNDER RUMBLING] Father! Kia! My child... Your kung fu circus has been destroyed. With the display of my strength... ...your soldiers are getting scattered like insects. I am here to take the Angel of China. No! Does anyone dare stop me? You will have to pay for this insolence. Zuhu? Are you surprised... Uncle? In order to settle our old score, I've returned much stronger than before. China will be razed to the ground from the fire of my revenge. Kiaa! [THUNDER RUMBLING] Finish off that child. Someone stop him... We must save the princess. Don't worry, your highness, I'll go save her. Kia... My child! Running away like a coward. Turn around and face me! Shadow ninjas! Come back. Magical warriors? Kia! Kia! Kia! Zuhu abducted my daughter... and there was nothing I could do... Zuhu? That traitor! He was so full of venom. That day, when he snuck into the palace in the greed of the throne... ...and he tried to attack the princess. ...you should have crushed him there, Arrest him. How could I do such a thing? He was my nephew. He was like a son to me. That's why I could only banish him from the kingdom Traitor! Get lost! Leave this country! I will be back to rain fire on China very soon. I'll destroy everything! Because of my decision I lost the Angel of China. Kia! I will leave right now with my army... and bring that Zuhu at your feet. Your Highness, I advice you not to send the army... Because he still has Kia. If he learns of the army, then it can put Kia in danger. Then how do we save the princess? Well... There could be one way to save Kia. Is there a brave warrior amongst you... who can save Princess Kia from the clutches of that evil man? I wouldn't dare take him on. Bheem hasn't returned yet. Whoever brings the Princess back safe will be rewarded with half the royal treasury. I just wish Kia is safe. This is my opportunity to please the emperor. Rose loves a good challenge. If I can save Kia, then I can make the Princess marry my son. Glutton. Your Highness, for the honor of China me and my son will fight against that traitor and bring the Princess back. Brave warriors, my good wishes shall always be with you. Return victorious. [HORSE NEIGHING] Hurry! Be brave, Ming. Bheem is back. Bheem, did you find Kia? Kia's cousin brother Zuhu turned out to be her biggest enemy. Bheem! When the emperor announced a big reward some of the kung fu warriors set out to save Kia. But, if they fight together do they have any chance of defeating Zuhu? Maybe they do. But Zuhu has magical powers. What? His Shadow Ninja's are not human beings. They... they... are made of magical spells. So we have no clue about Zuhu's powers. These people who are greedy for the reward then how can they defeat him? We want a team who would go to save Kia. Someone who doesn't fight for the reward but for the pure friendship. Only we Dholakpur people can make such a team. Yes, you're right, Raju. We love our friends more than laddoos. We'll make sure that Kia is unharmed. Come on, let's go get our friend back. For free? Glory to Dholakpur. This is Bheem's promise. We are all with you, Bheem... Me too. Boss, flex your biceps. What's this? Oh! What's going on? [COUGHING] Bheem, I think we should ask the animals for help. [MUMBLING] A donkey. Only a fool would think about riding a donkey. We must get there quickly, remember. Well, that donkey's better than the boss anyway. Yes, at least he can give us a joy ride. Would you like to come with us? Looks like he is not very happy to be called a donkey. Okay, then let's think of a nice name for him. Sonu? No. Chang? Hasmukh lal? Shyamlal? Chaman lal? Mungeri lal? Rocky? Then, he must be a female. Poor boss! He's always asking for trouble. Are you okay? Let's get out of here, boss. - Enough of this donkey's attitude. - Dumb donkey! Exactly that too a dumb donkey with bad attitude. Who does he think he is, a genius? So, Genius-ass, would you like to go on a journey with us? Yes! Yes! Tell us... Hurry up! We're getting late... Don't worry. Rumi will show us a shortcut. Rumi! We're going on a journey with Genius-Ass! [THUNDER RUMBLING] Who... who are you? Don't you recognize your cousin? Princess? Zuhu? Yes... Zuhu... The true heir to the throne. What do you want? Revenge? Revenge? So soon? First... I will acquire the greatest power in the world through you, Dragon's favorite. Power? Through me? The MahaYang Dragon's power! H-How? Don't you know? Our ancestors became emperors by getting a little part of the dragon's power. The dragon's power resides in the Divine fireball burning on its chest. You got the protection symbol from the Dragon. And that's why only you can invoke him and get the Divine fire. Then that power will be mine, and I will acquire supreme power! The power to destroy an entire army. You're my ticket to attaining unlimited powers. No, no, that will never happen. But it will happen. Dragon's protection. This is the power I want... All of it. And I will have it come what may. [HORSE NEIGHING] Which way now? [HORSE PANTING] Glutton! Hurry! Come on, climb on the bridge! Look, there are the other teams too. Another team? That Ming! [GRUNTING] [DONKEY BRAYING] How will we go across now? Like this! What is that? Crocodile! Help! Save us from the crocs. [ELEPHANT TRUMPET] [ELEPHANT TRUMPET] Let's not fight with each other. This is not a competition. [GRUNTING] Boss! Are you okay? Hang on. Let me check. Kia's necklace. I have a feeling she left a clue for us. Which means we should take this path. Let's go. Oh! They changed course. Wait for me, guys! Which way do we go now? Move. Let me take a look. That's too high... No way! Why don't we go this way. It's a slope. Easier to walk, let's go. Kia's bracelet. So that means Kia was taken this way. Yes, we'll go this way. Let's go. Genius-Ass, you can do it. I didn't mean you, boss. I meant we have to go this way. You said it was easier to walk on. This is a nice ride. It's getting really dark. And we don't have a clue about which way to go. All the clues that Kia left for us are pointing in this direction What do we do, Bheem? Nothing... Let's eat and sleep. Who are you? What are you doing here? Grandpa, we're looking for the Princess Kia. Will you help us? This is Zuhu's territory. He's the demon who devours children If he kidnapped the Princess, it means she is finished. And if are planning to save her, then you'll meet with the same fate. That's no ordinary place. They have a system where humans are crushed like sugarcane imprisoned in chains... you will be condemned forever to a life of hell. Zuhu has enslaved every person from the neighboring villages. And do you know why? To make an army of mud! Why don't the villagers rebel against him? Rebel? Hahahaha! That evil man has that one thing our life which we all love more than My darling, little grandson, in his prison. All the children of the village are rotting in his prison. And for the sake of their safety, all the villagers became slaves of Zuhu. Convince her to invoke the Dragon. Do whatever it takes. I want that Divine Fireball. I want that power. He takes advantage of people's weakness. And... makes them dance to his tunes. Even the Emperor will have to dance now. Because the Princess will never return. The Princess shall return, Uncle! And all the kids will be free. No one will have to dance according to Zuhu's tune anymore. This is Bheem's promise. Don't be a fool! Zuhu will crush you like an insect. Uncle, if you lose you accept defeat... but when you believe victory is guaranteed. You have no chance against Zuhu! Go back! Don't put your friends in danger... Forget challenging him. You can never get into his fortress, That crazy old grandpa's kept warning us. not go ahead But we still are. And then they say I'm asking for trouble. Kalia, only efforts pave the path to success. Bheem! Look there. Those carts are going inside. Look at the symbol on those carts. I'm quite sure they belong to Zuhu's army. Yes. And now we'll infiltrate the fortress using them. By disguising ourselves. Let's do it. There's the last cart. Let's hijack it. Yes, let's go. [GIBBERISH] Guys... this cart belongs to the circus. Now disguising ourselves is much easier. Come here. Come here, you. Cool. Hey! What is your name, sweetheart? Naughty boy! This girl is gonna kill you. Because her name is Alia. [LAUGHING] Hey... Stop! Hey! What's in the wagon? It's just us beautiful fairies, my handsome warrior! Let them through. It's the drama crew. Thank you, darling. Look Ming there is Zuhu's fortress. That's where we have to go! Pa, I need to pee! Quiet! Do it in there. Look into my eyes. Call the dragon. Listen, girl, stop this charade! You don't know what we are capable of! Get the dust out of my eyes. Take a look... Your dear Momo... Look at her pathetic state. If you don't listen to us, then beware... This is can't be true. It's just magic. Minister. Minister. The drama crew is here. And they are saying that the chief has called them! Zuhu called the drama crew? Hey! Let go! Greetings to the three baldies! Baldie? Aye, Who are you? Who sent you here? Minister, we came here on the chief's orders. Don't mistake us for ordinary tricksters. Your Highness, when fear and intimidation won't work... we'll charm you with fun and frolic. And we'll finish you forever. What do you mean? He meant we'll make your job easy for you. Why don't you try us? We'll make your job easy for you. Okay, okay! If you're really so good, then convince this girl. We want her to obey our orders. Of course, she will, sir. [CASTING SPELLS] Let the circus-magic begin, you're heart will win. This is the circus jam! This is the circus jam! Put your hands up Sing a song Two on top of one Four on top of three What a show watch them go they go on and on Jump on your feet Shake to the beat Kick and fly, send it high, higher than the sky This is the circus jam! This is the circus jam! Put your hands up, sing a song Move aside. Make way for Chota Bheem and friends One-Two-Three-Four Why is he going around in circles? Here? You take some too. And what's that round thing in his hand? This is the circus jam He convinced her very soon. Bheem. You took such a big risk for me. Kia! Ming! Are you all right, Kia? Yes... The dragon's protection kept me safe. You know, Zuhu wants to invoke the dragon and get Divine Fireball and become the most powerful What? He wants to destroy China. Ming... we must get out of here immediately. Show us something else? What is that? More drama crew. General Li? Princess, I came here to take you back. The Princess will go with Black Rose. Who are those tribals? This is the circus jam This is the circus jam Ming, what is all this? They are all greedy for the reward, Kia. One-Two-Three-Four This is no time to fight. Zuhu is extremely powerful. We should get out of here as fast as we can. Hey! Bring back the girl. Soldiers, what are you dancing about? They are escaping with the girl! Bring them back. What do we do now? [VULTURE SCREECHES] Hurry up, guys. Kia, we must get out of here quickly. This place is filled with dangers. And we are amidst of danger. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [EVIL LAUGHTER] [HORSES NEIGHING] [EVIL LAUGHTER CONTINUES] Escaping from Zuhu's fortress is no child's play. Stop right here. This is the time to fight together. Ming, take care of Kia. While I take care of them. [SQUEALS] [SWORD SWISHING] [SQUEALING CONTINUES] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Bheem! Kia! Bring my prized trophy here. Let go of Kia Ming! Rumi! Ming. How dare you challenge me in my own territory? Do you know what the punishment is? - No! - Out of my way! Don't hurt him. You can punish me. He came here for my sake. Please spare him. Why should I spare him, Princess? Why? Are you ready to do as I say? Yes, I will do whatever you want. I promise you. But please don't hurt him. Kia's weakness... is now in my hand. In order to save him... she will have no choice but to listen to everything I say. Fine, I forgive him... Save me! I got what I wanted. Your game is up! The fun is over. Friends! Bheem! [EVIL LAUGHTER] He came to save his friend but was captured himself. And he made our job easier for us. Who is going to save you now? Because your friends are... finished! Bheem! [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Stubborn kids. Grandpa, it's you? Yes, it's me. I saw all of you entering Zuhu's territory. Which is why I was waiting in the place where the carcass of the dead normally come through. Thank God, I managed save you. But my friends! Where are my friends? Bheem. Oh, thank goodness. Is everyone all right? Yes, Bheem. We are alright... But look at you... [GROANS] [EVIL LAUGHTER] A deep injury, but it's not fatal. You are all lucky to be safe and sound. Not all, Grandpa. Zuhu has our friend Ming... I know. I know... Chutki told me everything. We must save him. Zuhu can go to any lengths to force Kia. I've gotta go back right away. I can't even stand up. Who is going to save them? We've been surrounded by the darkness. But there is still a ray of hope. - You. - Me? Yes, Bheem. You! When people hear Zuhu's name, they tremble in fear. And then there's you. Who even after my strict warning was brave enough to enter his fortress and challenge him. Even though he gravely injured you... You have the courage to challenge him again. If have the slightest hope of defeating Zuhu, then that's you, Bheem. You are my grandson's last hope. Careful. Your wounds are still fresh, son. You need rest, my boy. Can't rest now. It's time to wage war, Grandpa. Bheem. What if practicing makes your wounds worse? Don't worry. Leave it to me. We'll practice together, I'll guide you. You? Yes. Come with me. Come, come, come, kids. So, my little sister, are you ready to make me powerful? Are you ready to help me? Summon your dragon at once. Even after suffering defeat... you haven't lost your ego, huh? Look. Let him go. I am ready to do whatever you ask of me. Kia. No! You can't put China in danger for my sake. Please forgive me, Ming. But I cannot see my friend getting harmed. Very well, then why don't you summon the dragon? He won't come! Don't try to fool me. Or else... Stop. He's not my slave who will appear wherever I call him. He's the MahaYang Dragon. I can only feel his presence on my birthday. That's the only day I can request him. He just might listen. But I cannot promise you. Meaning... I'll have to wait until the full moon. Very well. You may call him on your birthday. He will definitely come. And give me the fireball. Because he doesn't... then his dear child will be in a lot of pain. This was our ancestral home. Many years ago I used to teach kung fu here. Huh? [BELL TOLLING] But as I had grown old, I couldn't stop Zuhu's attack. That cruel man destroyed everything and imprisoned me and my grandson. I pretended to be a madman and escaped from his clutches. But... I couldn't get my grandson out yet. Grandpa, your grandson, and our friends shall soon be free. I promise. Well, then let's begin our preparation. Don't lose hope, Ming. Everything will be alright. [VULTURE SCREECHES] Kia... Rumi. Yes. Now, do you believe that our friends are okay as well? Yes. And maybe Rumi can find them. Am I right? You two look rather happy in there. Now, this is your palace until your birthday arrives, Princess. Bheem, your preparation will be different. You are injured, So you must focus more on your heart and mind than your body. Now answer this question, Bheem. You fought Zuhu twice, and he won both the times. Why? Our kung fu is powerless against his magical powers. The weakness is not in your kung fu but in your style. Style? I don't understand, Grandpa. Imagine this is you. And you're attacking Zuhu directly with all your might. What happened? Strength is not the only way to counter strength, Bheem. There are other ways. There are infinite examples in nature. Take this water for example. Water is soft. But the current is so strong, that it even uproots boulders. And its trick is to unsettle the ground from under each boulder. You will have to change your fighting style. You will have to be the storm that will uproot Zuhu. Look, you must push this ball all the way down to the surface. The ball will never touch the bottom. There has never been a kung fu warrior who has done it. [GASPING] [VULTURE SCREECHES] Rumi. Rumi. We only have a few days left. You must find our friends quickly. This message is for Bheem. Go, Rumi. Bring back help. Rumi. This means if the Dragon appears on Kia's birthday... then Zuhu will become very strong. Yes. Before he gets his hands on the Divine Fireball. We must do something. We will never be able to challenge him with the Dragon's powers. But her birthday is a few days later. Don't worry, friends. We'll be prepared to face Zuhu very soon. When I said that you need to focus more on your heart and mind... I didn't mean you could relax. I believed that... with hard work I will definitely succeed. But I don't see myself succeeding this time. I will move heaven and earth. To find some way out of this. There is one way, Bheem. Look. Look at that beautiful mountain. It's the Mountain of the Ancestors. It's said that there's a temple on its peak. And a unique gem is in that temple. If you can get your hands on that gem, then all your wishes will come true. But no one could acquire that gem. But if you can get it... I'll go right now, Grandpa. Be alert every moment, Bheem. Answers will appear in the most unexpected form. The Mountain of the Ancestors. I can't even make my way through this bamboo orchards. What kind of a place is this, Grandpa? Why can't I do such a simple task? It appears easy, but it's not. Water is soft, but the current is so strong, that it even uproots boulders. Strength is not the only way to counter strength, Bheem This water It feels so soft, but it's so strong that it can shatter mountains. From now on... not this way... No mountain in the world can stop the river from flowing. Even a thousand branches cannot stop the wind from blowing. I will face Zuhu's strength like the waves of the water and the gust of wind. In a powerful storm. I will use his own strength against him to defeat him. Bheem. Looks like you've found the answer to your question. Yes, Grandpaa. The harder I push this ball, the more it will bounce back. Very good, Bheem. Now I understood why you sent me there. To learn a new style of fighting. - The gem was just an excuse, right? - Right. Who wants that piece of stone when the real gem's right in front of me. Thank you, Grandpa. Kia! Happy Birthday to you, Dear Princess! Call him... Call him... Call the MahaYang Dragon. Otherwise... Kia. No! Don't put China in danger for my sake. [DRUMS BEATING] Didn't you hear, Princess? Summon your dragon at once. Pardon me, O Fire-wielding One. But I am helpless. In order to save my friend. I beg you for your Divine Fireball. Don't be upset, little girl. It's not your fault. Be patient. Soon the light of hope will tear through the darkness. It will. Yes, give it to me. Give me my divine fireball. [THUDS] There can be only one being worthy of this Divine Fireball. And that one is me! [VULTURE SCREECHES] Finish him off! Take that... and that... Wow... Raju! Where are you off to, princess? Give me that divine fireball. No! Give it back to me. It belongs to the Dragon. Hurry up! Give me that Divine Fireball. Oh, no! Zuhu should not get his hands on to Divine Fireball. If that happens then he will be unstoppable. Goodbye forever. Bheem! The time has come, awaken my explosive army Wake up! Oh, my explosive army! Spread destruction all over China. Destroy everything! Go! From the fire into the frying pan. What now? Stay away from those kids. [EXPLOSION] [BELL TOLLING] [EXPLOSIONS] What... What is happening, Lau Si? Your majesty, It's just what I feared. China is in trouble now. O Lord, only you can save China now. Do something, Lord. Do something. [BELL TOLLING] Bheem, there were some warriors... who could even control lightning. Now I will control lightning. I'm coming for you, Zuhu. What was that? Zuhu, are you ready for Round 2? Bheem is back! Impossible! How did he do this? Anyway... he can never face my powers. Don't waste time, children... Bheem will handle him. Some children are still locked up in the dungeon. You must hurry up and rescue them. But, Grandpa, you. Maybe Bheem needs me. I'll wait here. Now hurry up. [EXPLOSION] Run for your lives! What happened to my powers? Bheem. This is a miracle, your highness. I think the lord heard our call. And he saved us with a miracle. No. The lava is erupting. [PANTING] The dragon is in trouble. Where's the divine fireball? There. You won't get away so easily, kid. You will never get that Fireball. Let's see. Got it. I got it. No one can stop me now. Why isn't it working? If I can't have it, then no one can. Wait, Zuhu. The Divine Fireball won't work. Your armor is broken. Look around you. What did you achieve by spreading this destruction? Roots of evil are always evil, Zuhu. That divine fireball belongs to the dragon. Take my advice and return it to the Dragon. It's for everyone's good. You're right, Bheem. What did I get from all this destruction?
