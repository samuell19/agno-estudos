over 60 years ago, a master engineer had a vision. A spectacular unification of performance and style. Finally, it's here. Tonight on jay leno's garage: Where do we begin? We look at amazing technology of the past... Sort of the first, "hmm, Maybe the engine should be in the back." ...Present... Okay, I've ordered my car online. -...And future. -It's like air traffic control If they can steer the plane. the endless competition To give cars more power... Excuse me. ...Better gadgets, And to get rid of people altogether! Riderless motorcycle would pull over the driverless car. It's innovations and breakthrough. Cutting-edge advances like a super fast, Street legal, electric corvette. -Pulls all right. -Yeah, yeah. and what could be called The most hotly anticipated car of the decade, Chevrolet's mid-engine corvette. Plus big stars... Oh, I'll fix that. -...An australian... -They slam me onto the bonnet. ...Two minivans, and a robot! -There you go. -Oh, there, look at that. get ready, the future is now. Can we take it for a ride? I've been waiting since the eighth grade. Electric cars have been with us longer than many people realize, Well over a hundred years, And while there have been many breakthroughs along the way... 1909, this went 80 to 100 miles on a charge. ...The big advances have all come in the last 20 years With companies like general motors and tesla Paving the way for a truly electric future. But who cares? We still want cars that look cool And go unbelievably fast. Luckily there are people working hard So we can have both. now it is an electric engine, 500 horsepower. Waiting for a friend of mine, he's a very funny comedian Who loves muscle cars, he's from australia Where they have a lot of really cool muscle cars That we didn't even get in this country, So I'm really curious to see What he'll be driving today. Hey, jim, how are ya? -Hello, mate. -Nice, I guess, minivan. it's good, good mileage, uh, Part electric, pacifica, chrysler. -What happened? -I'm a dad now. The ex left me, so I had to get a family car. this former rebel turned minivan driver Is jim jefferies, current host Of comedy central's "the jim jefferies show." What are the odds he would have a show named after him? Jefferies has made numerous comedy specials Because, well, he's a really funny comedian. When you hear about cancer, you just give money. Don't be ..., you just give the ... Money. Don't go, "I need to see 15 comedians or I won't be happy." since jim's been a dad for a few years now, I think he deserves an innovative treat. Actually, I got something I want to show you. I think you're gonna like this. Come with me, come on. Thought you might get a kick outta this. is this a corvette? yes, technically, it is a corvette, But it's an electric corvette. Engineers and automotive experts at genovation Have taken the classic corvette shape And merged it with today's cutting-edge digital technology, Creating what they claim Is the world's fastest street-legal e.V. Twin electric motors help provide the gxe With 800 horsepower and 700 pound-feet of torque, Giving it a 0-60 of less than three seconds And a top driving speed, the company claims, Is in excess of 200 miles an hour. We didn't try that here in burbank. Much cooler than a minivan littered with empty juice boxes. Oh, look, you got bright lights. I'm sold already. Knight rider lights on the side. You should start with knight rider lights And then work down to the horsepower. obviously, obviously. am I allowed to touch it? -You can touch it. -All right. Ooh. That's beautiful. is this the first automobile you've seen? Look, I drive a minivan, mate. -Yeah, I know, I saw that. -So this gets very exciting. It's been years since we talked, and the last time, It was all about challengers and... I had an orange dukes of hazzard colored challenger. Right. -And then a maserati. -Right. And I always wanted to have like a hot wheels car, Something that looked like... When you're a kid, right, No one ever played with the mercedes. Mercedes is a good car, bmw... You played with a car that looked like this. -Of course, of course. -And when you're in your 30s, When you'd look cool in the car, you can't have one 'cause you got kids and there's no back seats there. Then when you're in your 40s And you've got the money to buy a car, People say you're going through a middle-age crisis. -... Those people. -Yeah, yeah. -Pulls all right. -Yeah, yeah. -Fantastic! -And so, Now what was your first car in australia? Uh, it was a gemini holden, holden gemini. a holden gemini, what would the equivalent be to that here? maybe like a toyota camry or something. Not a real great car. It was a golden holden. It was like a gold paint, had a rust hole Where you could see the floor through the bottom. so what was your first car when you came to the states? I came ten years ago and I bought a secondhand 45-year-or-something anniversary mustang, And I literally bought it the first day I was here For like 9,000 bucks, just went in a dealership. I really thought that I wouldn't be in america For more than three or four months. -So what made you stay? -An hbo special. I don't care what anyone says, there is that lust For every foreign entertainer to crack america, And it stills exists for some reason. We all grew up watching "mickey mouse" and "happy days," And I saw an episode of... I think you were in "laverne & shirley"? Yeah, yeah, I was in "laverne & shirley." -You were like a biker? -I was the boyfriend. So stupid. It's funny. Do you get stopped very often? Do you get many tickets? I got a couple tickets when I owned the maserati, I got a couple tickets in that. My brother's a cop. One time when I was about 17, I maybe have had one beer, But I was 17, drinking age is 18 over there, And I get pulled up and they breathalyze me, I'm in my brother's jurisdiction, My brother was like a sergeant at that stage, And so I went, "hey, uh, do you, uh, You know danny, danny jefferies?" And the guy's like, "no, I never heard of him." And then I was sitting there maybe 15 minutes, A long time I was sitting there, And I was going, "what's going on?" And I go, "is anything a problem?" And they go, "please step out of the vehicle." And I went, "is--is there a problem?" "please step out of the vehicle!" So they get me out, they drag me, They slam me onto the bonnet, and they cuff me up, And I'm like a kid, I start like, "ahh, ahh," crying like that, And then I hear my brother laughing in the radio. Oh, that's... -You wanna give this a try? -Yeah, of course. all right, let me pull up over here. I think I'm taller than you, But I can't--I can't touch the pedals. I got little, tiny, stumpy legs. okay, well, there's a switch down on the side. Excuse me. put it in drive. yeah, away we go. There's no handbrake? no, no handbrake. all right, here we go. -Driven electric cars? -I've driven electric cars, And this feels like the steering's A little bit more like a race car. The tesla feels more like a normal luxury sedan steering. Put your foot down, see what she does. well, that was 100 miles an hour. -Did we get to 100? -Just about. -All right! -That's all right. How many, uh, crimes did I make just then? I saw the kid you nicked on the bicycle. I mean, when I first made it big, I bought my dad a cadillac. Did you ever do anything like that? Four years ago I bought my father a mercedes-benz. I bought it from america, just over the phone. I'd never even been into the dealership. -Now, did he know? -He didn't know, he had no idea. He had no idea that this was happening. I told him we were going to the pub because that's how Me and my father bond, is through drinking, And I said, "we're going to the pub," And then I drive in the dealership and I said, "oh, I just want to have a look at a car," And my father's very obsessed with me saving money And all that type of stuff, and so he went, "oh, you waste your money on bloody cars. You'll never have any money left." And I walk in and they go, "hello, gary, this is your new car," And they pull the silk shade off. Jaw open, it was probably the greatest moment in my life, But the thing that made it sad was, Then my father went, "oh, your mum's gonna be upset." And she was 'cause it turns out she doesn't like him having joy. I said to my mum, I said, "I bought you and dad a car," And she goes, "you bought your father a car. You'd never buy me such an extravagant gift." And I said, "you can't drive!" "what am I meant to spend 70, 80 grand on? You sit in a chair and watch tv. Do you want a tiara?" That's very funny, that's very funny. My mother wanted to have a chair after that. It's a reclining chair that actually rose Into a standing position. That's the last chair you ever own. -Are you hungry? -Yeah, I'm very hungry. now, obviously we've seen Electricity can revolutionize the car industry, But how about the burger industry? -Wanna try something different? -Sure. this show is all about innovations and breakthroughs, So believe me, this ain't gonna be no ordinary burger. The future of food. future of food. hey, flippy, let me have a double hamburger, Medium rare, ketchup only. What do you want? -Flippy! -You don't have to yell. He can hear you, he's not deaf. flippy, two patties, uh, Special sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheese, grilled onions. -There you go. -It's about to do something. there you are, there, look at that! Hey! this is more exciting than I thought it would be. turns out no matter who's cooking your burger, It still takes longer than you want, But hey, it's the future, And flippy, uh, nice job, I--I guess. -Very good. -Mmm, not bad. I think the future of burgers is safe. we don't need people. we all know the world is becoming More and more autonomous, and it's not just hamburgers, It's automobiles, autopilot, auto manufacturing, Auto everything! I'm not sure if that counts. Anyway, with all that automation comes a whole new set Of auto problems. And who's gonna solve all these new problems? Well, the answer might surprise you. Now, this may appear to be An autonomous car 'cause as you can see, There's nobody behind the steering wheel, But actually there is. Well, how far away are you, eric? hey, jay, I'm about 15 miles away right now. All right, he's about 15 miles away And he's got a screen, and he's seeing Everything I'm seeing out the window, Probably even more because I'm not really paying attention. I'm looking at the camera and he's actually driving the car. I'm on my way to pick up elliot katz. He's one of the founders of this company That's really pushing and developing this technology. -Elliot, how are you? -Hey, jay. -How long you been doing this? -We came out in 2018, We had a remote operator sitting in our office In silicon valley remotely driving a vehicle All throughout las vegas, so 500 miles away, And we were able to do so while it was pouring rain, Oftentimes in areas with no lane marking, So a lot of areas and conditions That are difficult for autonomous vehicles, Which is where we make our money. Autonomy has gotten to a very good point But it's not yet 100 percent, So when you run into any issue, whether it's a construction site Or an area that hasn't been pre-mapped, You know, inclement weather, We can take over and drive for that portion of the ride. these people are essentially Like air traffic controllers in a tower. They are sort of watching the whole deal. it's like air traffic control If, when air traffic control saw a problem, They could also steer the plane. okay, the big question: Is this legal? Is there a cop behind us? What a coincidence. I guess I'm about to find out. Oh, is this, like, legit? Okay, all right, let's see what happens. I'm in a car being driven by a guy over 15 miles away In mountain view, california! Is there a cop behind us? Uh, there a problem, officer? All right, let's see what happens. hello, officer. This is eric, phantom operator d617. I'm in complete control of the vehicle From a remote location. you're free to go. We gotta get more of these remotely driven cars. This is the best way to get out of a ticket there is. Drive on, eric. After a little explanation from us And a checking of a penal code, he let us off Because it is totally legal! Our penals were fine! So who's better still? An actual human doing the car Or somebody like eric from 15 miles away? our remote operators can drive Just as well as a human who's sitting in the driver's seat. -Really? -I think we should do Something head-to-head. I haven't seen eric, but I'm guessing My head is bigger than eric's head. So in a head-to-head race, I would probably win Because I have kind of a giant head, So I think we will find out. We have a bit of an obstacle course. We have three beloved american comedians: Jeff dunham, tim allen, and of course, brad garrett. And eric, your job is to go in between them, Without hitting them, as quickly as you can. But if you hit them, it's okay 'cause it's more work for me. -You all set to go? -Let's burn some rubber, jay. three, two, one, go! safe. He can be quick, but he's always safe. oh, that's not really quick. look at how he navigates around brad garrett though. It's an american icon he's working around. Doing pretty good, let's see what he looks like -On the way back. -Oh, he's coming back? -Yeah. -Wow, okay. gotta watch that brad garrett. Tight turn around tim allen. Never wanna hit the tool man. Around the stretch, jeff dunham, flawless. wow, yeah. You know, If you're getting paid by the hour, that's pretty good. He's gonna make himself a lot of money. Not bad, I mean, considering he was 15 miles away, It was actually pretty good. all right, jay, now it's your turn. -Let's see what you've got. -Give it a shot. If I don't win this, humans as we know it are doomed. One, two, three, go! Whoa, whoa! -How'd I do? -Looked a bit unsafe, jay. Looked like you killed tim allen. Oh, I hit tim allen? You mean I missed the other two guys? -They're still standing. -Oh, I'll fix that. That's the one thing your car will never have: Road rage! The corvette has been an iconic american sports car For over 60 years. Have you let any of your friends drive it? -Never. -Excellent! Since 1953, there have been seven generations, And a great deal of the model's success Is attributed to a man sometimes called The "father of the corvette," Zora arkus-duntov. Starting in 1953, zora directed innovations In fuel injection and engine block technology That transformed the corvette from a stylish roadster Into an automotive powerhouse that challenged Top racing brands from around the world. Despite zora's massive success with the front-engine corvette, There was one dream he was never able to fully achieve: A full production mid-engine version of that car. But it wasn't for lack of trying. Over the years, zora and his successors Experimented with six mid-engine prototypes, And of course, any time you even think of changing something, People just freak out. Remember a couple years ago how some corvette enthusiasts Almost lost it over the modification to the headlights? So the idea of moving the whole engine, well, Let's just say it stirred up a bit of controversy. Luckily corvette isn't afraid of a few angry tweets. Today I'm meeting up with ed piatek At the marine corps air station tustin, A warehouse built back in 1942 As a base for military blimp operations, And I'll be one of the first to drive the culmination Of 60 years of innovation, and from what I hear, It's gonna be one hell of a breakthrough. -Hey, ed, how ya doing? -Great, jay. -Great to see ya. -Great to see you. So the history of the mid-engine corvette Really starts with this car, doesn't it? yeah, this is what we call cerv I. Cerv stands for chevrolet engineering research vehicle. this was sort of the first, "hmm, maybe the engine should be in the back" kind of corvette. yeah, zora was a big fan of the performance capability Of having this mass over the driven wheel And really thought that might be an opportunity To take corvette to the next performance level. And this was the next gen, this is cerv ii. Now we're starting to look more like a gt or a sports car Because we got two seats. yeah, this was a car that he built In consideration of going against The ford gt40 at le mans. Mid-engine with all-wheel drive. He drove this car over 212 miles an hour At the milford proving grounds. Now, this is cerv iii, right? yeah, this is a car that we built in 1990. and this is when cerv Really started to look like corvette. -Right. -You see all The corvette elements in the front end And obviously the insignias and all. yeah, a lot of elements went Into the fourth and fifth generation corvettes That were inspired by this design. Okay, now let's get to... The new king of the hill. there it is, jay, the 2020 corvette stingray. very nice, wow. and for the first time ever, We'll have a mid-engine architecture To really leverage all that performance capability That zora thought we could deliver by getting All that mass of the powertrain over the driven wheels. boy, it's, you know, it's the future. I mean, to me, the real genius of this car Is the fact that it's priced around $60,000. right, the starting price will be below $60,000. you know, to me, that's always the thing I find Most exciting about american manufacturing. A lot of people can build a car For a half a million or a million dollars Because money's no object. To get the kind of performance of those kind of cars In the $60,000 range, that's when the engineers, That's when the marketing, that's when the whole thing Comes together to make a car like this attainable -For the average person. -Yeah, I think, you know, Corvette's always been a dream car, But it's also been attainable. It's not a half-a-million-dollar car. And to deliver this kind of performance At a price point that people can afford, We're pretty excited about that. plus, a lot of mid-engine cars, You can't open it to see the engine. -Right. -Can we open this one up? -Yeah, absolutely. -Let's show people what we got. Wow. Very impressive. yeah, there's the heart of the new corvette, the lt2 engine. and a huge trunk. yeah, the trunk was designed To stow the removable roof panel, And it also can accommodate two sets of golf clubs. Let's open it up and see what the interior looks like. -Door handle's right up in here? -Yeah, we hide the door handle In the cove to keep a really nice, clean line. boy, I like this sort of cockpit-inspired, F-18, whatever fighter plane you want to say. right, it's very driver-centric. All the controls point at the driver, great ergonomics, And we really focused on keeping the cowl low To give you sort of that command view. You can look right down the hood at the road. Really makes it easy to be Inch-perfect if you're on a track. It seemed like last generation corvette, You were sitting maybe a little more further back here. Now it seems like we're up closer to the front. Yeah, we've moved the driver's h-point -About 16 inches forward. -Is that the h-point right here? yeah, your hips is what we call that. And the bottom line is, the driver now Is at the center of gravity for the vehicle, So as you turn the car, There's an immediacy in the response. You don't wait for the front of the car to turn -And then you get a sensation. -You know, it's a beautiful car. -Can we take it for a ride? -Yeah, let's go, jay. We've been waiting a long time to drive this thing. I've been waiting since the eighth grade, okay? Well, how cool is this? Since the official unveiling doesn't happen For another 12 hours, And to avoid paparazzi and spy drones, I'm told we have to keep this top-secret ride Inside the blimp hangar. Oh, I also hear the guard dogs are pretty vicious too. Wow. I know it's about the same weight, But it certainly feels lighter than the previous car. you know, I think a lot of that's the stiffness of the car, And that gives you the perception That the car is very nimble and agile. We were at a point where I think we've gone As far as we could with the last architecture, And the only way to beat that generation Was to reinvent it. With the analytical tools we have, the modeling, We were able to finally do a better corvette As a mid-engine corvette. Feel that, uh, small-block chevy Really want to push the car down the road. yeah, I mean, yeah. Okay. I mean, obviously, we're not on a race track, We're in a building, but it's, uh, you know, It feels very go-kart-like. It's just very darty, And I feel like you can make it do whatever you want it to do. yeah, we even packaged some of the roof trim around my helmet. They were able to actually scan my helmet in And mathematically mold some of the trim and stuff Around it so people of my size could drive the car on a track Without having to scrunch their helmet down or what have you. So it really makes it easier for big people To put a helmet on and drive the car. very nice. Ed, thank you very much, you've done a brilliant job. -Thank you, jay. -You can go back to your family. Ed's been working on this for the last six years. He hasn't been home. His kids have grown up, he doesn't know. So you can go home, have dinner with the wife. Take a day off, you've done a hell of a job. You and the whole team, it's very, very impressive. It makes you proud to be an american. -Thank you, jay. -I'm gonna drop ed off And then I'm gonna take off in this thing. Coming up: This just looks like a minivan, But it has, what, close to a thousand horsepower? 1029 to be exact. well, this episode's all about innovations and breakthroughs, And the car I'm driving right now Has got a little bit of both. It looks like a porsche cayman, but it's not. It's actually a boxster that's been heavily modified. It has all kinds of fascinating technology in it. It's built by a shop called bisimoto in ontario, california. Boy, they know what they're doing. wow, not bad, not bad. bisi ezerioha is the innovative mastermind Behind bisimoto engineering. A nigerian-american entrepreneur and build expert, Bisi is so smart he started college at 15, And he's made his mark in the car world By taking unremarkable cars and engines And totally reworking them to squeeze out Just incredible levels of performance. he's very smooth. I see a lot of drivers jabbing. He's really, really smooth. He likes this straightaway. Wow, jay, good job. Okay, that's a tricky corner. okay. Of course, yeah, yeah, we're fine. he spun out. Tires are too cold. -Well done, jay. -No, not really. Takes a while to get used to it. I spun it over there, as you saw. oh, the tires are a little cold. yeah, that's it, the tires are-- -Yeah, the tires are cold. -I saw it. You did very well. That turn three, You were a little hesitant with that initially, But you got very comfortable later on. what were we hitting on the straights? I saw you doing 138. oh, okay. That felt like 110. you did well, very impressive data here. You're very good on the throttle, very smooth. I see a lot of drivers jab, but you're very smooth with it. -Much like the woman... -Like you're making love... like the woman, you must be very smooth. I teach you about love, my friend. thank you, sir, I need-- I need some lessons. that's what she told me. What's it weigh, about 2,400? you're very good. 2,460 to be exact. yeah, that's what I thought, and I'm probably, This is part of the 60, yeah, so... And what is it, about 450 horsepower? jay, this is frightening now. I've never told you about this car, but you're right. well, that's what it feels like. This is actually a hot wheels car, -Isn't it? -Absolutely. Well, let's talk about you for a minute. A lot of guys from my generation think, "oh, kids aren't interested in cars. They don't want to turn screwdrivers and wrenches." But this is the new tool, isn't it? -It is. -And this is what you use When you download all the data. You know, back in my day, you'd come in And guys would take the jets out or they'd look at the plugs. "a-ha, this plug's hot, this plug's cold," And go back out again. -Now you do it all... -Yeah, technology's our friend. We use technology to our biggest advantage And it allows you to create wonderful things And analyze data and make things even more efficient and better. like this, I mean, this just looks like a minivan To the uninitiated, but it became a cool hot wheels car Because it has, what, close to a thousand horsepower? 1029 to be exact. I wanted to eat my cake and have it too. I wanted something I could haul the kids around But also have some fun when I need to. you know, this is the van jim jefferies could use. This gets very exciting. well, I'd like to see how it goes. Could I possibly drive this one? -I would insist you do. -I'm glad you insist. -Let's give it a shot. -Jump in. you know, I like this very much. It handles very nicely. I mean, when it comes on boost, look. That's a modified. we use actually a gearbox out of an acura tl type s On the factory j-series 3.5-liter v6 engine That came in this car originally, But of course we modified it extensively. All the accoutrements, bells and whistles, Pistons, rods, camshaft, valvetrain, Built properly also with a turbocharger, And she runs on e85 fuel. -It's the ultimate minivan. -Yes, sir. so are you the first generation of your family to come here? Actually, both my parents went to school here -In the u.S. From nigeria. -Oh, they did? Okay. both my parents are scientists, so many of us followed suit. I'm an engineer, and I have siblings Who are physicians, pharmacists, and also biochemists. I'm starting to see this culture now Where it's cool to be a scientist and engineer, And I wish more kids would get into it. -Yeah. -'cause you can have fun, You can create projects like this and drive yourself. and what was the oddest thing about american culture? It was hugging. Americans hug a lot. We don't tend to hug or anything like that, you know? It's a cultural thing, people tend to give each other Space and so on and so forth, but for here, I'm like, Oh, my goodness, a lady comes up to you and hugs you? Oh, that was a young man's dream to get hugged left and right. It was pretty interesting. let's see what this thing can do. -Feels good. -Thank you, jay. coming up: Some say this is the future of car-buying. You order it online. And the car comes down. It's electrifyin'! Drifting is a worldwide passion. From the streets to formula d, It's loud, it's elegant, and like all motorsports, It's constantly evolving. I want to do some drifting today, So I did what everybody does these days: I ordered a car over the internet! And I'm picking it up at a carvana vending machine. Sometimes your car gets stuck, You have to shake it a little bit. Oh, here it comes now. Come on, let's go check it out. -Travis! -How's it going? This is travis reeder. He's a drift driver for napoleon motorsports. They built this car. It's a camaro el1, But it's been converted to electric. With 800 pounds of batteries feeding a single tesla motor, The el1 makes a solid 515 horsepower, But more importantly, it's the very first All-electric drift car to compete professionally. This could change the face of drifting as we know it. Car guys can be pretty set in their ways. Were you looked upon as kind of an outlier -With this electric car? -Oh, yes. No one really wanted to step into that unknown, And we got to talking about it and we're like, "you know what, We're gonna do something no one's ever done before." now, why not just run a tesla Or an electric car that's hopped up? Why take a gas car and convert it to electric? napoleon motorsports has background in trans am racing. They always ran camaros. When they were venturing into drifting, They had the opportunity to get this car from a buddy of theirs. This car was actually lightly hit by a freight train. okay, I love that. See, only a used-car salesman Would say, "it was lightly hit by a freight train." -Yeah. -How do you... How do you lightly get hit by a freight train? And then what happened? You stripped out the motor And, obviously, you gutted the thing. Yeah, stripped the car, gutted it to a bare chassis, Did all the fabrication work, And then started building from the ground up there. So tell me about the feedback you get From this versus the gas car. You hear things you normally don't hear in a drift car. Usually you listen to the motor, it's loud. With this, the noise aspect isn't there, So you really have to rely on other senses to drive the car. You hear the tires screeching more. They change pitch as wheel speed gains and decreases. So you kind of, you feel the car, What I like to call my "butt dyno." -"butt dyno"? -"butt dyno." As you give it throttle, you feel the car accelerate; As you let off, you feel it slow down. Well, travis, enough talk. Let's see what this thing can do. all right. just listen to those tires. Isn't that better than some stupid music they drop in? Yes! Can hear those tires singing. Oh! -How was that? -Yes, very good! You know, it's so fun. It's actually more enjoyable Because you're not getting the fumes And you're not getting a lot of the co2. There's still enough noise to keep you excited. Okay, cue the dumb rock music. Travis, this has been fantastic! As john travolta would say, it's electrifyin'! Now for when designers run wild. Nowadays, any number of cars can simply parallel park themselves, But life wasn't always so easy. For decades, parallel parking struck fear into the hearts Of drivers everywhere. Throughout the years, a few brave designers Tried to solve the tricky parking dilemma. In the 1930s, an inventor named brooks walker Created what he called the fifth wheel. It's just what it sounds like, An extra wheel that looks like a spare tire Used to gracefully park your car. Of course, you could just learn to parallel park. Hey, it's not that hard! How was that, mr. Hot buns? I think we got it. -Coming up: -We taught the motorcycle How to ride a bike. now, did you run into people Who'd say, "no, that's crazy, you'd never be able to do that." -All the time, yeah. -All the time, yeah. The motorcycle I'm riding right now Is a bmw r ninet. This motorcycle has disc brakes, Traction control, anti-lock, You've got heated grip. This is a pretty advanced bike, but traditional. We're gonna go see my friend larry. He's starring in a new movie. It's a remake of that classic, "the invisible man." Hey, larry, good to see ya. Now let's bring in the gentlemen responsible For this piece of amazing technology. You know, a car being able to drive, Okay, the stability problem is taken care of Because it's on four wheels, obviously. -Where do we begin? -The traveling environment In the future will change a lot. Cars will get connected, more intelligent, And we as motorcyclists want to be part of it as well, So we taught the motorcycle how to ride a bike To get more knowledge about the vehicle's dynamic. obviously this was built sort of for fun To show that you can do it. Nobody's gonna put out a riderless motorcycle. -Sure. -But where do you see This technology being used in the future In other sort of bmw products? autonomous vehicles are here. You can think of a bike that's able to tell you You're going too hot into a corner Or you need to be, you know, harder on your braking. So you can be an advanced rider, you can be a beginner rider, And the bike could actually help you. So the accident avoidance technology would be Obviously really something you could really use. well, and if your bike was communicating with the car And telling the car that, "hey, there's a motorcycle in this area," Or there's a potential collision, It actually helps the car avoid the collision as well. Now, did you run into people within the company who'd say, "no, that's crazy, you'd never be able to do that," Then you feel you have to do it? -All the time, yeah. -All the time, yeah. even my boss didn't think that we were really able to do that, But we proved him wrong. so how does it stay stable? I imagine there's no gyroscope or anything of that nature. no, that's what's cool about it. So if you think about a gyroscope, That's keeping the bike balanced, keeping it upright. -Right. -This doesn't have any of that, And so it's really all of the rider inputs Or what a normal rider would have riding a motorcycle. 'cause once a motorcycle is rolling, You could take your hands off the bars And sort of steer it by... That part, although hard, Is not as hard, I imagine, as initially pulling away. for starting and for stopping, We have an additional kickstand on the other side That can be automated, so like a human That puts down its foot when it approaches a traffic light, The motorcycle can do exactly the same. well, gentlemen, it's just, just amazing. Could I borrow this? I--I have an idea For something I just want to try. In the future, there's no telling How many lives will be saved by this incredible technology, But for now, I got the perfect gig For this cyborg motorcycle. Ah, now that's the future. Pizza! You hungry? -Yes, I am. -Yeah, I'm sorry, I would've gotten one for ya. I didn't know. Buckle up, folks, it's time to assess and caress With donald osborne. well, this episode was all about innovations and breakthroughs. I am jay innovation, this is donald breakthrough, And we have three cars here from three different eras That were innovative breakthroughs. -Tell us what we have, donald. -Jay, today we've got A 1925 cadillac v-63 phaeton, We have a 1934 chrysler airflow imperial cx, And a 1914 rolls-royce 40/50 silver ghost. Let's start with the cadillac. You look at it and you say, "well, it's certainly an attractive car." What is innovative about this? Well, jay, this car comes to us from our friends At farmers insurance, and in fact, A car like this 1925 cadillac Was the very first car they ever insured in 1928. And this is one of these cool things they did back in the day. See, to prove that your car was insured, Farmers insurance would give you this, You'd put that right on there, you see, so... Oh, you got insurance, you're okay. this particular model pioneered the use Of a cross-plane crank in the v8 which made it much smoother Than it had been before with the flat-plane crank. you know, I have a 1918 version with this engine in it, And that goes down the road 50 miles an hour, comfortable. It's really what cadillac was all about. there's a reason why cadillac Used the slogan, "the standard of the world," For so long because cadillac was very successful. They won the coveted dewar trophy three times, The first time for parts interchangeability, And then for the electric starter. It also was the first passenger car With front-wheel brakes standard. And speaking of the dewar trophy, Let's go to our next car, the 1914 rolls-royce. The silver ghost is one of the legendary cars of history. The model is actually the 40/50, But it got the nickname "silver ghost" From a particular car, the silver ghost, That ran from london to edinburgh, Almost 600 miles, in top gear, Which is absolutely an amazing accomplishment. They followed that up and won a dewar trophy For a 15,000-mile continuous driving tour After which they tore down the car, opened up the engine, And found no measurable wear. it was smooth, it was quiet, It reached a level of efficiency And performance that was unheard of. Exactly. Our third car, The chrysler airflow. This is the first american mass-produced car That was designed with a wind tunnel. this is a classic case Of trying to sell something before its time. A lot of times when they come out with futuristic cars, They're a little too far in the future and people, "whoa." Like this, with this... People were used to this kind of a grille, You know, this big rolls-royce or the cadillac with the thing. You know, whereas this swoopy, Sort of santa fe express streamline thing, It just looked odd to people. In fact, this is the only year they did What they call this waterfall grille. They went back to a traditional kind of front. it should have been the most spectacular car Of the 1930s for america. but now we have to decide which one Has appreciated the most? in the last five years. I think rolls-royce has appreciated the most Because the resurgence of rolls-royce, Much like bugatti has revived the old name, The new rolls-royces are quite successful, And in the history of the automobile, This is probably one of the most written-about cars of all time. So you're hitching your wagon to the ghost? Yeah, sure, why not? Yeah. five years ago, This cadillac might have been bought For about $35,000. Today it would be about $80,000. The chrysler airflow, five years ago, A terrific one might've been $200,000. Today, a really nice short-wheelbase one Might sell for $160,000. Now, the rolls-royce, five years ago, Would've been about $1.1 million. Today, a silver ghost with its original body In a touring style would be about $1.8 million. So certainly the silver ghost is the most valuable Of the cars here, but the one that wins The appreciation sweepstakes Is the 1925 cadillac. Oh, but the one that's worth the most is the rolls-royce. You know, this is an argument we have every week on this show. To me, it's the one that gets you the most money. It's not that, it's the one that's moved the furthest From point to point. I still like what I said better. never let the truth get in the way.
