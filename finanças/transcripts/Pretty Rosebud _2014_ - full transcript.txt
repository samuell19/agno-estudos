Gotta go. Did you by any chance call those people that you designed the sports club for? They loved your work. - Yeah, they're not hiring. - At least you tried. Could you mail these bills for me? Yeah sure. Ash Wednesday brings the time of Lent. This is a time for battle, battle over sin, battle for our own souls. In biblical times, ashes were used in the preparation for battle by the Maccabees who fought for independence. Ashes were also used to express sorrow for our faults and our sins. - After you. - Thank you. Good morning Lauren. - Oh, hold on a second. Morning Cissy, you have a message here. Everything Ok? - Yes. - So if not, continue with the divorce, I'm telling you... Hello pretty rosebud. Your dad and I want to invite you and Phil to lunch Sunday. Love you and God bless you. What have you got for me? Here you go. And I did the survey analysis. - Oh. Looks good. Scottie, check this out. - Bias is low, excellent profiling. - I have a surprise for you two. - Do you have any idea what this is? Is she pregnant? - Or better, we're getting a promotion. Mister Allen, your coffee. - Thank you Lauren. - And please let me know if you ever need anything Mister Allen. - You're an angel, thank you. - Here are two of my most loyal and talented staff, Scott Kilpatrick and Cecilia Santos. This is my good friend Frankie, I mean Frank Allen, our next Congressman for the 29th District. - It's a great pleasure. - Likewise. - If you can handle Dom, you must be good. Way back when she was doing some pro bono work for my company you should have seen her. Man she could drink us all under the table. Frankie... - In fact there was this one time-- - Business! - Ok, Ok, I'll back off. - This campaign will be your baby from now until next November. - Wanna meet the rest? Onward. It's a pleasure to meet you. See you some time next week. Somebody from my office will call you. - Great. Oh my gosh! Wait a minute, what? You're going golfing? - Yeah, the guys needed a four. - What do I tell my parents? - Tell them a great opportunity came up. - A great opportunity. - Baby, free greens fees. That's 100 bucks. What, somebody looks a little cranky. - I'm not cranky. - You're not cranky? No. - You sure you're not cranky? You look a little cranky. - Oh God, please stop it. No, no I'm not, I'm not cranky. - Kiss me and I'll stop! Ok, ok. - Where's Phil again? - Oh I forgot, he had a tee time scheduled months ago. - Well, you should have told us. We would have met on a different Sunday. - Ok, I Bubba. - How's work? - Good. - You spend so much time at work. I'm worried about you Cissy. - Everything's great. - Dom, my boss, she's amazing, I'm learning so much from her. - Be careful Cissy. You set your goals too high you won't have time for a family. And how's Phil's job hunting coming along? - One of his dart buddies is looking for a business partner. - Good. - What kind of business? - Carpet cleaning. - Oh. - So Jun, how's your work? - It's great actually. I just finally got to meet the board of directors. - Cool. - Yeah. Yeah and get this, the company right now, their net worth is over 10 billion. - Wow. - Better watch your money Jun. Miss, miss, we'd like to order. Jun, would you care for a beer? - Yeah, sure. - Dad, I'd like some wine. - Yeah sure, when she comes back. - Dad, what did you mean I need to watch my money? - Candace is a lawyer right? - Yeah. - When she divorces you, she will take you to the cleaners. And by the way, she's already divorced once. - Yeah, she's divorced because she got married when she was really young. - In God's eyes, divorce is a mortal sin. - I mean a lot of people are getting divorced nowadays so. - If lots of people jump off the cliff, that makes it all right? We have to send this boy to China to look for a wife. - What are you talking... My mom's Filipino and Spanish. - Well your mom is an exception. - What your dad is saying, is people of similar backgrounds stay together longer. We are both from the Philippines. We are both Catholic-- - Look at Cissy and Phil, similar backgrounds. Well although he could go to church more often. Did we pray? - I thought we prayed, didn't we? - I have no idea, I came late. - I don't think we did but I wasn't sure so I just got started. - Let's pray. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost Amen. Bless us oh Lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, Amen. - And help June find a good wife and bless Cissy and Phil with many children with their limbs and cavities in tact, Amen. - Amen. - Two jab, jab, cross, jab, jab, cross, jab, jab, cross hook all right let's go, keep your hands up.

Have a good day. - You too. - Can you tell me what office I'd be working out of? Yeah, let get back to you on that. Hi you've reached Phillip and Cissy. Leave a message and one of us will get back to you as soon as we can. Have a great day! Hey Phil, hey Cissy, it's Janet. I'm calling you guys 'cause I want you guys to come over after Mass on Easter Sunday. We're having lechon. Oh and Cissy, bring your parents over too. All right you guys, see you then, bye! - You see you have to match up the song list with the mini keypad and then you have to choose a song... No, no, no, no, no, not that one. Ok. - Time flies. My boys were hoping the Easter Bunny would bring them their little sister. And Cissy, when will it be your turn? - Oh, not just yet, we're so busy with things like projects and work. - Are you sure there is nothing wrong with your plumbing? - My crazy wife is so busy at work she doesn't have time for me, let alone kids. That's Ok, you'll stay home and take care of them. - Cissy, you should start having children. - We like to try and get back into a bigger place first. - I can't wait to have grand children. - Oh and they'll be so cute with Phil's hair and your eyes. - You work too much, leave it to Phil. - Actually Lola, I'm working right now on a campaign. Frank Allen. - Is it true, he's a gay? - I don't think so Lola. He's been married three times. - That's even worse, divorce and remarry, divorce and remarry. How can you trust a man like that? - It's terrible, the way peoples nowaday treat marriage. * His truth is * Marching on - Thank you, thank you. "Cissy, you should start having children". Is your mom gonna give us the money to raise them? - She's just expressing her opinion. Other people's opinion shouldn't matter so much. - Obviously. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. - No, what Cissy? - Nothing. Just drive. Good morning pretty rosebud. When are we going shopping? Call me. - Hey mom. Yeah, how's Wednesday? Yes, I'll come to church Sunday. Of course, I'll bring Phil. Love you, God bless you, bye. - You busy? - No, come in. - Check this out. - Oh my gosh is this-- - Yep. Oh you click over here, you get his infrastructure ideas. Up there is his tax policies. Over here watch this on his bio. - I'm Frank Allen, I'm-- - Mister Kilpatrick, I am impressed. - Miss Santos, you should be. - I should get back to work. I came in late today so. - Sure, hey don't forget those drop offs. We need your signature by the end of the day. - Of course. - Ok, good. - There she is. - Hey, fundraiser, my place, the 14th, bring Phil. - Of course. - I'll call you with details. - Sorry I'm late. - Where's Phil? - He had a meeting. - There's no one in the confession line. Let's get up there quick, go. - All right, I don't need to go. - Go, go. - Bless me Father, for I have sinned. - Cissy is that you? - Hi Father. My last confession was about a year ago. - Probably longer. - My sins are, I have lied several times like maybe six, I slept with another man and I have not been to church every Sunday. That is all Father. I am sorry for these sins and all the sins of my life. - Cissy, Cissy, Cissy. First things first. You know that honesty reinforces the integrity of the soul. - Yes. - And you know that God being your best friend deserves at least an hour of your time a week. - Yes Father. - But really concerns me is this sleeping with another man? Premarital sex is one thing, extramarital? What's going on with Phillip? - Father, Phil hasn't worked a job in almost two years. He said he won't do a job that demeans his spirit. - Long confession. - Reminds me of someone else I know. - Your father's clued me in on your situation. - Really? - Yeah. Phillip is breaking the marriage contract because the man is supposed to be the main provider. - Oh. - That doesn't mean you can run into the arms of another man. You're also breaking the marriage contract. - Right. - My advice? Don't confuse yourself. You can't ride both sides of the fence. Actually you shouldn't be riding the fence at all if you're not married to the man. Make an act of contrition. - O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee. I detest all my sins because of thy just punishment. But most of all because they offend thee, my God who art all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin. Amen. Hey. Hey. How was your day? - It was good. - Any luck? Want chicken stir fry for dinner? Huh? Yeah, sure. - Don't forget Frank's fundraiser Friday. Frank's a fake. Well, he's paying our bills. Can you please get us the waters? Let's pray first. Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive with thy bounty, through Christ our Lord, Amen. This must be your other half? - Indeed, this is Phil. Phil, Frank. Absolute pleasure. - Likewise. - You must be very proud of your wife. She's a huge asset to my campaign. - Thank you. - If you'll excuse me, time to kiss some butt. - Of course. Thank you. Oh hey, there's Dom, let's go say hi to her. - Excuse me, Cissy! - Hey. - Phil! So glad you could make it. - Absolutely, great turn out. - Lots of deep pockets too. - Hey Cissy, hey Phil! Hey beautiful house huh? - It's a home, we haven't been able to do much. Oh, there's the Reverend. I need to talk to him about an endorsement, excuse me. - So Phil, how's work? - Actually I'm in between. - Honey, I'm sorry, I need to catch Doctor Duke, excuse me. - You know what Cissy, I'm gonna come with you. Phil, I'll catch up with you later. - Would you like another drink sir? - Yes please. - Red or white? - Doesn't matter. - There you go. - Thank you. - Hey honey. There's some people I'd like you to meet. - Hey, can we go now please? - Attention! Attention everyone! - Wait, we need to stay here for this. Today we support an extraordinary man. He protects the environment. He fights for human rights. He develops local businesses. Hell, the only thing he doesn't do is age. Ladies and gentlemen, a dear friend and our next congressmen, Frank Allen. - Thank you Dom. Well before I make any promises and ask you for money, I'd like to thank my beautiful wife, Barbara for all of her support. Without her, I wouldn't be here today. I'd also like to thank Dominique Andrews for this beautiful site today. She's done a fantastic job heading up to media and marketing for my campaign. Now I also have to acknowledge the backbones of our marketing strategy, Scottie Kilpatrick and Cissy Santos. Come on you two, come up here. Without their hard work and dedication, we wouldn't've held on to our 10 point lead, so let's give them a hand, give 'em a hand. We've endured some tough times these past few years. Now as your next congressman, I promise to revitalize the American dream. And with your help and support, I know we will be successful so that America will once again be the land of opportunity, thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you, have a great time. Don't you need some of those? Yeah, I got some already. Yeah, thanks. Look at that. Oh, that is funny. So mom, I wanted to ask you, "How do you and dad do it?" - What do you mean? - Everything you know. Money, relationships priorities... Phil hates my work. But he won't work. Not since he got downsized. - You mean laid off? - Yes. Laid off. And I honestly thought that after we sold our place, moved to a smaller one, it'd force him to get a job, help around the house, pay bills, something. - Maybe you should help him with his job search? - I try. I circle job leads in newspapers, I make inquiries and you know what? He never comes with me to church and he forgets family things. I don't know he just doesn't seem to try anymore. - Have you tried therapy? - Yes. And he says we don't need it anymore. And mom, in bed he just like goes through the motions. - Is your libido stronger than Phil's? - Yeah, I guess so. - Like father, like daughter. - What? - Remember in fourth grade, you kissed Jimmy on the playground? And Bobby and Anthony and Terry? Now you know why we were so strict. - I always did like boy germs. - Boy germs don't always make a girl happy. - Hey! We should stop meeting like this. - Yeah, I agree. Look, here's my card. If you want, give me a call some time. Maybe we'll have coffee or something. - Sounds good. I'll see ya'. - See ya'. - Can I help you? - Yeah, exactly how long is this emergency meeting supposed to take? - I have no idea, please take a seat. - Hey babe, I'm home. - Oh hey honey, I'll be right out. Hey honey. Hey. - What's going on? - I'm gonna go head to Palm Springs with the guys. Jerry scored us a great mid-week deal through work. - How'd it go today? - Waited for an hour and then I left. - They didn't even meet with you? - No, apparently they had better things to do. - Well, did you at least reschedule? - No I really didn't get a very good vibe from the place you know? - The Visa's maxed out. You can use the MasterCard. - Ok. - When ya' coming home? - Friday. - What time? - I don't know, it depends on traffic, why? - Well, you have a meeting with Frank. And then, I was thinking afterwards maybe you and I could do something? - Yeah, yeah maybe. You seen my golf shoes babe? - Yeah. Out front by the hall closet. Alejandro! I need to talk to you. What happened here? - That was my shot at the title. I had the guy against the ropes and I was I was hitting him and hitting him. I was hurting him. And all I keep thinking was I really don't want to hurt this guy, I mean really hurt him. And he knocked me out. Thought you might be hungry. - Let me just finish this. - No, you need to take a break. - I have to get this out to your people. - You will not keep working without any sustenance. You'll collapse and that will not look good for my campaign. - Ok, Ok. - Smells good, huh? - Thank you. The 30 second spot with your family is the one that focus groups love the most. Check out the stats. - I'm thoroughly impressed. - Scottie helped me with-- - I hold you entirely responsible. You know, I like working with you. - I like working with you too. You're gonna win this election by a landslide. - You know I'm going up to Sacramento this weekend. Maybe you should head up there too. There's a lot of key people I'd like for you to meet. - How about Scottie? Well he's working on that beach clean up. That'll close a gap with the green votes. - Right. I'd love to but I have a family thing this weekend. - Ok, well next time then. Hi you've reached Phillip and Cissy. Leave a message and one of us will get back to you as soon as we can Have a great day! Hey baby, it's me, pick up, pick up, pick up. Ok, guess you're not home. Traffic's terrible so we're coming back tomorrow morning. Miss you, bye! - Hey Dom. Oh yeah, right. I'll be there in half an hour. Thanks. - Hey babe, I'm back. Hi honey, how was your trip? - Well you know, traffic. - So there's some food in the fridge. You can warm that up. Dom needs me to get... - When were you gonna tell me? - I'm sorry, I-- - You tell the whole world but you don't tell me? I'm your fucking husband! - I was waiting for the right time to tell you. I'm just staying with my mom and dad-- - We don't need to discuss this? - Discuss? Discuss what? You don't ever listen to me-- - Do you even think about me? - I just need space to think. - Space? Space God dammit Cissy! How long you been needing space, huh? - You know we've been having problems and-- - You think moving out is gonna help that? I need to distance myself to think clearly-- - Distance, how about some distance from work, huh? How about that? - Don't attack my job-- - Oh no yeah, let's not attack Cissy's baby. Let's not attack the campaign. God forbid! Where the hell are you going? - Work! - Yeah, fucking work! - I was stupid, really dumb. - Hello, are you coming? What's wrong? - Nothing, nothing. - It doesn't look like nothing's wrong. No, I'm fine. - Cissy, what's wrong? - Nothing, I'm fine. What happened? - Oh fuck. I fucked up. Cissy what's-- - I fucked up. It wasn't supposed to happen this way. - What wasn't supposed to happen this way? - He wasn't supposed to find out like this. He just, yelling and yelling. I needed space to think. Our parents want us to have kids. How can Phil and I possibly have kids, when he's one big fat kid and I'm a complete mess. Slow down. Looks like somebody could use some straightening out. You want to get some air? - Sounds good, yeah thanks. - So, the screen he saw this, you left it up on the screen? - Yeah. - Yeah. Is that why you were late today? - Yeah. - Yep. I got it Cis. - He just wouldn't stop yelling. I don't think I've ever hurt him like that before. - So how did you and Phil meet? - We met at a Filipino art show. I remember thinking he had the kindest eyes. I don't know, he fit, automatically. Like we spoke the same language. - So you got married? - Yeah. Wanna have a seat? - Yeah. - I wanted to be ready but I don't think I was. And I don't think he was either. His mom bailed him out of credit card debt, three times. - That's not a good sign. - God I don't know I think at a certain point you you just get married 'cause you're supposed to. You know it's the next natural step like learning to walk or going to college right after high school. - I can relate. We had a similar situation. Well we got married right out of college. But one thing was the same was we wanted to and we weren't ready. - Why? - Parents! Our families go way back you know. Everyone thought it was a great idea. - It sounds familiar. - One thing I learned through all that is you got to put yourself first. - That sounds kinda selfish. - You can't put everyone else first. You got to life your life on your terms. No one else is gonna do it for you. - Well sometimes I wish someone would because I am so tired of screwing it up. - They'd do a horrible job at being you, horrible. - So what should this say? - We need to set a time limit so put down six months. - Well I don't know if I'll be ready in six months or a year-- - And we also got to figure out how many dates we're gonna have each week. - Ok, two or three? - Three. - I'd prefer two. - Just put down three. - And I think we should be allowed to see other people. - What?! Why? - Because we need to figure out if this is something we really want. - No! No way, absolutely not. No seeing other people. - Well how about as friends? - That's not really seeing them then is it? Look just put there will be no dating of other persons for recreational or experimental purposes. Wait, you know what? Make that, there will be no dating or sleeping with other persons. - Harder. Harder! - So how is work Jun? - It's good, really busy. Oh, by the way you know the big case Candace was working on? She just won. - That's great Candace! - Congratulations. - Thanks, I'm just glad it's over you know, all the long hours. - That's 'cause you care about your clients. I'm proud of you babe. - Thanks. Doctor Lam? Jun tells me how affected you got when your patients are doing badly so it's kind of the same thing. - Speaking of which, dad how's your work? - Fine. Megan Mahoney's got a birthday coming. We should get her something. - Yeah. - Who's Megan Mahoney? - You met her before. Pretty woman from the drug company? - Mom, this is great, thank you. - Missus Lam it's delicious. - Thank you. - You know what? I'd like to make an announcement. I wanted to say this earlier but last week when we up to Napa I asked Candace to marry me and she said yes. We're engaged! - What a surprise! Congratulations. - Ya! Oh congratulations! Oh my God. I love you guys. - Thanks Cis. That boy! Cissy! You should work things out with Phil. Ok dad. - Believe me marriage is not easy. - Yes. - And I've made some mistakes in my time, we all have. But divorce is not the answer. There isn't anybody else is there? - Of course not. - Good. You must pray and talk to Father. God will guide you. - Yes. - I can talk to you but I don't know about Jun. I can't talk to him anymore. He's so Goddamn stubborn! - He's just head strong. - The boy doesn't listen! I tried to tell him for his own good. That son of a bitch Candace is trouble. Cissy? Maybe you can talk to him. Tell him how we feel. Ok dad. - Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. - No, it's Ok. - I knew I'd find you here over the weekend. - Well I just wanna make sure we win. Well, you win. - Well I was thinking you need a break. - Well I appreciate the offer but I have a lot of work to do. - My wife is away with the kids. - Why don't you give them a call. - Come on. All work and no play makes Cissy a dull girl. - I play enough. - Really? Yeah but not with me. Come on. As part of my media marketing campaign you have to do what I want. - You know tonight's not good. How about Friday? - Friday? Ok. I can do Friday. I can what 'til then. See ya' then. - Well this is a surprise, come on in. Thanks. Yeah. I always knew he was a little too interested in you. - You called it. - You know you don't have to do this. - I can't just up and leave. I've put way too much work into this campaign. This is a big project for Dom. And they're friends. You can talk to her. - All of this is just too much to deal with right now. My head's gonna explode. - Hey? - I swear, you couldn't make this shit up. What do you think I should do? - I can't tell you what to do but whatever you do I'll support you. * Good morning pretty rosebud * I pray you tell me true * To be as sweet as a red red rose * What must a buddy do * To be as sweet as a red red rose * A little girl like you - A little girl like me * Must grow and grow * And grow and grow * And that's what she must do - I miss waking up to that. - Soon you will have your own rosebuds you can sing to. Aren't you going to work today? - I think I'll work from home today. - Your dad and I have a dinner tonight. You're welcome to come. - That's Ok, Phil and I are gonna cook dinner. - Good, good luck. And tell him we send him our love, yes. - I will. - I love you. - I love you too. - Hey honey. What's wrong? - Come on Cissy, don't! - What? - I know. - What are you talking about? - I know you're lying to me. I know. Come on Cissy do you think I'm stupid. I know. You have no idea how much that hurts me. - I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you. - Yeah, well you did. And with somebody I know. - What? Who? - Does it matter? - Who do you know about or think you know about? - Jesus Cissy, how many guys did you cheat on me with? - Just tell me how you know or what you know. - Do that and all you're worried about is what I know? - Wait, I can't believe you are gonna leave without telling me what you know. - 'Cause Cissy, right now that's all I got over you. - Hi John, it's Cissy, give me a call. Hola, Alejandro. Llámame. Hi Scottie, it's me Cissy, please call me. Hi mom. I have something to tell you and you're not gonna like it. I cheated on Phil. And you found out? Please don't tell dad. You think? Ok, Ok. Thanks, I'll try to see him. Love you too. Bye. Thank you seeing me on such short notice Father. My pleasure Cissy. He's hurt. - I know. - So what do you want to do Cissy? - How do I stop? - Do you want to stop? - Honestly-- - No, lie to me Cissy. Do you want to stop? - No. - Why? - Because I don't get what I need from just one person. I go to different people to get it. - I see. Perhaps what you need doesn't need to come from someone else. - You mean it has to come from Phil? From God? No, not exactly. - From me? - Well God is in you. You just have to listen to him. You know the Commandments, thou shall not kill, thou shall not bear false witness don't just pertain to dealing with others, but also yourself. - I've been breaking more Commandments than I thought. You and your dad are gonna give Catholics a bad name, all that guilt! - I don't know what to do Father. - But why? - I don't want to be judged. I just want people to be happy with me. - If every sermon I wrote I wanted people to be happy or to like me I would never write or say a word. You'll always be judged Cissy. You can't make decisions to please others. - Well right now I'd settle for just not making anybody mad. - How was the talk with Father? - It was good. - He's helped out your dad a lot too. Oh, speak of the devil. - These are for you my darling. - Thank you. Thank you. - Cissy. - Hi dad. - No work today? - No, I took off today. - Good, you can eat with us. - That's not cooked yet. And dad can you help us set the table please. - Yeah. - Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes. - You know what, I'll just clean this up. - Good, good. How was your appointment with the new dentist? - Well, you know how it is. Doctors always make the worse patients. But did he do a good job? It was all right. He's just got this weird face. - Cissy, can you please pass the rice? - He's got these huge bucked teeth, you know. I can't believe it. A dentist with bucked teeth. Like this. You are exaggerating. It couldn't be that bad. No he was. Can you believe that? A dentist with bucked teeth like this. Cissy, you're awfully quiet tonight. - Got a lot of my mind. Cissy! Cissy! Stop it! What's wrong with you? You're gonna break something! - You stop it! You stop it! - What the hell is the matter with you? - What the hell is the matter with me? What the hell is the matter with you? How could you? You did it! Again! - Did what? You make me sick! You cheated on mom. - We went to karaoke. - Do I have to spell it out for you? I've known for years, for years! - What are you talking about? - I overheard you arguing back in the sixth grade! Don't you see how he flirts with every woman he comes across. If he does it in front of your face, can you imagine what he does behind your back? Are you blind? - Don't talk to your mom like that! I didn't raise you to-- - You didn't raise me, you intimidated me! And I am sick of it! - Don't talk with such disrespect! You're so American-- - I'm Americanized right? Yeah, Americans-- - Stop it, both of you! You are so alike! Yes, your dad is a flirt, I know. But so are you. But your dad did not cheat on me. - Letty. Look. I'm sorry that you overheard the argument. Yes, I cheated on your mom, once. And it was the worst mistake of my life. I wanted to tell you children but your mom thought you'd lost respect for me. You'd stop loving me. - I didn't want you children to get hurt. - We always wanted to do what we thought was the best for you. I never wanted to hurt any of you but the truth of the matter is I'm lost without your mother. She's the best woman in the world. Best woman for me. In today's gospel, there are six bridesmaids with oil, six without. Some people are prepared for the coming of the Lord. Some are not. We must be ready. We gotta clean house, finish old business. We can't move forward with dead weight shacking our feet. Many times we wait for a catastrophe, a death, an earthquake, an illness to say the difficult things to make things right. Many people keep plunging along day after day and not living in the world that God intended. Living in fear with their dreams and their hearts buried. We don't know when we will be called. We do not know when we will breathe our last breath. So why live one more minute of your life waiting to live it? You have no idea how much that hurts me. Be careful Cissy, you set your goals too high, you won't have time for a family. You should start having children. This campaign will be your baby from now until next November. My crazy wife is so busy at work, she doesn't have time for me, let alone kids. Phillip is breaking the marriage contract because the man is supposed to be the main provider. Other people's opinion shouldn't matter so much. You're also breaking the marriage contract. I can't wait to have grandchildren. You know you don't have to do this. It was the worst mistake of my life! You have to do what I want. And all I kept thinking was I don't really want to hurt this guy, I mean really hurt him And he knocked me out. - Got a minute? - Yes I do. Got more than a minute. - I've requested to be assigned to a different account. Here's a copy of my resignation letter and nondisclosure statement. - I'm confused. I thought we had an agreement. - We don't. - Not good for your political career. - I know. - Wait, you don't even want to try any more? Come on Cissy we can work this out. - No. I don't want to be married anymore. - But I've forgiven you. - No. - Just never thought it would come to this. - Me either. I'm just hoping that, God I know it sounds stupid, but we can you know, remain friends? - But I have an idea. - What? - Remember how we started off that big, beautiful wedding ceremony? - Yes And? - We gather here today not for a sad occasion, but a joyous one, to symbolize their peaceful dissolution, we'll now have Phil and Cissy light their candles. - Well wait, we should light the same one together. Let's light our candles first. - No, no, no, no, no, we talked about this. We light the center one first, then we light both of our candles from it showing that we are becoming two entities from one. - No, we light the center one together as a symbol of our covenant with each other are coming together. - But we're not coming together. We're-- - This is ridiculous. - Phil is right. Just cooperate. - With all due respect Lola Pin-ing, don't interfere! - Mommy! - What! - Everybody could we just please calm down and let Jun continue. - God created us and brought us forth into the world. These two people came together for a time to walk along the same path, hand in hand, now they have come to a fork in the road facing diverging paths. Let us bless both of these journeys as they each go and grow in the ways their souls need to. At this point, anyone may add their own prayers and intentions and we'll respond by saying, "Lord hear our prayer." - That you bless everyone here. That you bless Cissy's parents and my mom for all their support. Lord, hear our prayers. - For all the good times we've shared, we thank you Lord. Lord, hear our prayers. - That the children learn from this and grow stronger as a result. Lord, hear our prayers. - That all of us will turn to God in these challenging times. Lord, hear our prayers. - That you forgive us for breaking our vows. Lord, hear our prayers. I'm sorry.
