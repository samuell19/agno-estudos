Sophie's Revenge Don't move Miss Sophie At last, I've caught you You know These comic books of yours are poisoning women's views of love and marriage nowadays You go too far and you dare to write in your books Women can only... What was it? What? Only by discovering herself can a woman ever find true love I heard he's come back Miss Sophie Don't drink so fast You were saying this is your first comic fiction? The title is very interesting "Handbook of Love" I'm sure the audience is curious to hear about the story behind this "Handbook of Love" How should I answer them Could I tell them this is all because of 2 years ago I made the stupidest mistake of my life When I was young, my mother told me a woman in love is foolish but a woman rejected is crazy But I didn't understand until 2 winters ago My mother also said men must choose the right career and women marry the right guy What she meant was a woman's job is to find Mr. Right So to be successful you have to find that special guy Hold on You must have misunderstood... This is me, hanging outside A loser stalking my ex-boyfriend and his new lover a famous actress Joanna having a good time You okay? Sorry I didn't see you Look out! C'mon, it's not that scary Come watch it with me This is Joanna's horror movie You like it? Leaving my gifts all over the place Serves you right Give me a kiss I'll help you up C'mon I caught you again Didn't we agree no eating after 10pm You little piggy Friends, you see this? This is the pain of breaking up Slowly torturing me with all that used to be mine My memories of Jeff are countless parasites crawling, crawling crawling, crawling crawling all over me Looking for the vulnerable infected veins sucking wantonly sucking dry my hopes and dreams You're awake Your fever's gone down Good thing I decided to break in otherwise you'd be a goner You scared me to death Thought you would never wake up You two, stop watching for fun you, fold those clothes you over there wipe up the furniture and windows... 3 times Yes, ma'am Your life isn't over because you got dumped Don't let some jerk ruin your life It's not worth it Lucy how come smart women can't get hitched Because they're all like you full of themselves You done? I told you Sophie and Jeff didn't match Breaking up was only a matter of time Don't kick her when she's down You're saying that because you are jealous I don't care So what if he has the goods Who cares?! He's not my type Lucy! Just speak one language please Either Chinese or English You're giving me a headache It's not my fault you flunked English... These are my 2 best friends Lucy and Lily Just don't know why as soon as they meet, they argue but they still hang out together Lucy my agent single forever boyfriend in and out but my mother would think she's a failure As for Lily before graduating college she was already way into her "career" becoming the most "successful" among us No matter what I love them both because they love me too You.. shut up! You... shut up! I heard that Joanna goes through boyfriends like toilet paper Her last one was some Taiwanese photographer Honey it's hopeless You think you can just quit like that? It's not that simple You should rescue Jeff from the fire He has ready jumped into the fire and you want to "rescue" him? You just don't get it Don't be ridiculous Nobody understands them better than me Next, please join me in recalling the highlights of their relationship Please watch the big screen 2 years ago Sophie was just out of college studying to become a comic book artist had an attack of appendicitis But luckily she met the perfect surgeon, Jeff Li He removed her appendix and in return gave her his heart However the good times didn't last Just last week in the very same hospital room the same love story repeated But this time, the female lead was not Sophie but rather it was the famous movie star Joanna But if you ask me if you insist all is fair in love profession or not is not important Get her! This is nonsense Stop it! Stop! I'm the one who understands Sophie Ok, go for it Sophie from a very young age has always been competitive Once she set up her mind she never fails If you ask me, this set back is only temporary I believe you'll get over Jeff in no time Go Go Go Look at you... why are you crying? If my mom finds out I've been dumped she'll kill herself Sophie, where have you been? I've been looking for you for days You're not even answering your phone Sophie!

Got to go, bye! No way I want to prove to the world that I'm good enough for Jeff I will get him back before the wedding That's my girl I support you You two are nuts Why'd you want to marry a guy like that Sophie Sorry, I was wrong Please marry me No! If that's what you want, you have my support too I'm not going to support you I won't do anything else I don't believe I can't win him back You won't do anything else? What about the book proposal you'd promised me? If we delay any more the publishers will cancel the deal Guy's gone. Why bother? What if I tell the story of my revenge in the new book Are you sure? I'm not sure this is a good idea You sure? No problem I shall prove to broken heart people everywhere We can win our ex's back using "scientific" methods I know they all think I'm crazy then, why do I feel so good After tossing about all night I came up with my first move Strategy #1: Forgive His Trespasses No matter how badly he stepped on you you shall only show him tenderness and forgive him with a smile in your heart Because as long as he's happy you're happy So beautiful When Jeff sees you today he'll regret for sure You will overwhelm him with kindness he will be touched by you You're so sexy you will win for sure Your clothes are so beautiful I love it Dr. Li the patient in bed 3 will discharge today What are you doing here Honey ever since you left me my heart has been hurt But I'm happy for you because you are happy therefore, I am happy too Sophie I was wrong forgive me Let's start over again Young lady What's your name?

Go The doctor said I didn't break anything Excuse me Creep Just have a look and know he' s a bad guy Go When a mare was in heat a stallion will take hold of a territory No other can trespass After the heat period they will go back to their herd A woman's stomach is the best friend with her heart Always adjusting itself to the heart's condition When a woman loses her love her heart starts to leak then the stomach tries to help to stop the leak by stuffing the leak with everything to compensate for the loss until..

Miss Sophie I can totally get how you feel right now but the relationships are really complicated So when people break up it's best to be open minded Have a more tolerate attitude is better I'm telling you this because I know Joanna quite well and she is really not a bad person If... Sorry, sorry! Looks like you know her pretty well Ok, that's enough Did you drive? Are you that photographer from Taiwan? Yeah, and what if I am? I thought I was the only victim but there's you too Excellent to meet you Spit it out and share with me Let's go You're just pretending to be happy Enough, don't make a fuss, Miss Sophie I think you misunderstood The 2 of us should be a team win-win! You should go home I've taken her on already Yeah? Doesn't seem like it went well for you Just you wait, for later I've got more... Don't throw up! It's an emergency! Really urgent Hold it, hold it My mom always said smart people are not afraid of failure because failure is for the weak And I am not weak I shall go forth bravely growing from my failures push forward unrelentingly until reaching the final victory Men are lazy so they never discard anything not even a woman who has betrayed him Too lazy to even erase the memory Not true You're not qualified to say it You abandoned me and your daughter for some bar girl Don't confuse Sophie just because of us I tell you So that means I can fully exploit this weakness in men To remind Jeff that a new relationship is not match for the old familiar one That way, he'll definitely think twice and return to me Strategy #2 The Glorious Past About the other day I didn't really mean what I said It's okay I have some things to return to you When are you going to be home? Not till really late tonight I could come pick them up from your place? Didn't you say we were going home now? Yeah, but if I had said that then she'd come over right away Don't be mad Strategy #2 The Glorious Past Use objects and phrases to bring back memories Even some pet phrases bring back good memories of the past Reminding him that the past is far better than the present What'll we do after dinner tonight? Whatever you want? Actually I'm a bit tired It would be good to stay at home Okay What's wrong? Why don't... we go out to eat? No Didn't you say you will cook noodles for me? Little piggy! What a cute little piggy For me? No.. I gave it to Sophie No wonder Smells of cheap perfume Disgusting How come her stuff is here? Maybe she has dropped by What? Joanna Don't be upset How can I not be angry? She still has the key of your place We need to change the locks Let's go out and talk Why? Can't we talk at home? It's not that Are you worried that she bugged the place? The neighbor might hear I'm not afraid of anything I have nothing to be ashamed of I just wonder Why don't we just go out and chat? What were you thinking? How could you fall for such an Unreliable and unbalanced woman? What do you have to say for yourself? C'mon, let's go out for a walk and cool off Cool off? I'm just getting warmed up For real you're already broke up and she's still coming by your house Why are you going into the bedroom? Why are you shouting for? Aren't you scared the neighbors will hear that? So. Does she come here often? And it's not the first time right? How could that be? Let's go, I'm begging you I'm not going. I'm tired Why are you going to the bathroom? I have to pee Sophie Are you here? Come on! Let's go You scared me I'm not hungry I'm starving, please Let's go You've gotta be kidding You look fine, why change? I have a public image to maintain She's simply unbelievable! We have to change all our things Tell the maid to clean thoroughly These sheets have to be changed She could have laid on them. Okay, let's go What? Strategy #2 The Glorious Past To be continued You should tell her firmly to stay away from you She's not your girlfriend anymore Hello? Gordon, hold on a second Can't believe she would break into your home It's so creepy You should call the police Get in the car Hey Gordon I'll call you later Hello? Hello? Although it didn't go as smoothly as I'd imagined as my Mom used to say a loss can turn out to be a gain I believe good luck is right around the corner Hello? Hi, this is Gordon Is Sophie there? Gordon Wow, nice Beautiful.... Beautiful Let's me see that line now So tempting I'm drooling over here Sexy, sexy A little bit to the left Hey! Where'd did you come from? It took me over 2 hours to make that That's it, I quit! Were you serious about what you said at the party about taking revenge on Joanna? You've made up your mind? You're definitely going to break them up? Whatever it takes? And no matter the outcome? But I think... actually... I think it is not right Don't interrupt, just listen I have thought it for a long time I will put bottles in all over her rooms, every room You listen to me, listen to me I have many ways... Winter is coming I will turn off all the water pipes of her home Joanna is going to publish a book Really, she is going to publish a book It is about her experience of taking movies She can't only be 23 years old When I was in high school she was already 23 and that was like 10 years ago What, I'm aging and she's not Which kindergarten did she go to? That's rich! You've been sleeping the whole time All this time, and you've not given a single idea Who says I haven't? You didn't give me a chance Okay, we're here Okay, good night Here you go, keep the change Okay, so now's your chance Go ahead Now? Little Alex Don't expect too much I'm not a good cook So much food Bon appetite Why be so modest about your cooking Jeff always said I didn't cook well enough What's wrong? Are you really Little Alex Didn't your mother ever tell you It's impolite to go flipping through things at people's homes? You know, I've read your books before Really? But I'd always assumed it was a guy How come? Because your stories seem to have such a male's view on things It's hard to believe it came from a girl like you I guess what I'm saying is.. what you express in your books that kind of unconventional thinking doesn't really match your behavior these days For example? Dumped by your boyfriend and still stalking him Don't you think it's a bit petty? Finished eating? C'mon, don't be mad I just don't understand how such a great girl like you can't just let go If I were so great why did I get dumped? Maybe it's just not meant to be Maybe you're not supposed to be with Jeff Who said I wanted to be with him my whole life Then why are you doing this? Isn't it because you love him I loved him because I thought he loved me even more I thought he could give me simple, steady love something that would last forever But that's really not a good reason to love somebody Did you ever think? Maybe that's not what Jeff wants? Maybe his idea of love is a crazy passionate reckless kind of love Then why didn't he say something earlier? Why wait till I've got my wedding gown ready, sent out all invitations? All my friends knew I was getting married and then he went and changed his mind Better than getting married and then divorced, right? So you know it all now, you got dumped too, right? Alright, don't be angry Remember, we are partners Let's not attack each other Tell me your next plan Lesson 3# Extreme Makeover Hello? Guess who I saw? Success When I was little, I had a dog just like this His name was Little Alex We were best friends I had him for 10 years Buy another then Who has time for that? Besides, pets are just a distraction That's what Jeff used to say Let's go and play with him So lovely I'm tired.. Time to go home Go home? I thought we were going to see Joanna's new horror movie I'm not going I'm seeing her tomorrow She will ask me if I've seen it Horror movie? Are you joking? I wouldn't even go with Jeff Hey, aren't we partners? I've been helping you all day Come on, let's go I don't want to go Don't worry, let's go C'mon, just try it out I'm really tired It should be good, I'm not lying I am exhausted Not to that extend Joanna is much bolder than you Of course she is She's not human I think you're hungry. Dinner's ready, let's eat Coming No man has ever cooked for me My parents passed away when my little sister was only 3 I had to take care of her You know when I was 3 my dad ran off with another woman You know what? You're actually quite photogenic from a certain angle anyway Is that what you photographers say to pick up girls? What are you talking about? I haven't shot portraits in years Really? I just saw a bunch of portraits in you other room Those are all leftovers from an exhibition 5 years ago You've had exhibitions? Don't tell me you're a famous artist No. Only a so called master maybe Yeah I've signed the book contract When can I see the draft? How could she have any time for that? She's dating No wonder you are glowing He's just a regular friend Really? If you say so.. Not bad Not bad, quite nice Red light Cute guy You ladies seem to be having fun I'd also like to buy this car Its design and performance are both excellent I quite like it However, I still want to further understand its performance Wait for me Slut You're jealous again No way Me?! Jealous of her? My husband is handsome and rich and so in love with me How could I possibly be jealous of her? Lily's husband does in fact have a lot of money But, as to how handsome, or how in love with her She knows best of all Dick! I like this one, buy it for me Dick! What are you doing? Who the hell is she? What the hell do you say about me? Is she..... Dick! What? You dare seduce my husband! What are you thinking of? Wanna come shopping with me after this I can't I'm going to the gym What? The gym Woman, thy name is fickle How about I teach you to play ball I can teach you something else Okay, call me when you are ready I don't like going to the gym because there are too many mirrors But in order to get to know Joanna and implement my 4th move of "Befriend thy enemy" going to the gym this is the only choice Strategy #4 "Befriend Thy Enemy" Hey Miss...

I'm at the hospital You broke her leg. Didn't you know that? If something worse happens to her it'll all be your fault It sounds like you really care for her I tell you she was asking for it That would teach her for messing with me It's okay, its okay You know what? She just isn't good enough Isn't this just perfect broken leg and all It'll take at least a month to heal And we still have to keep mom in the dark Tell her that we are both busy Who will take care of you? I'll take care of her We came up with the idea together All that's happened is my fault too Dumplings tonight The most delicious dumplings! You know what? I wish it wasn't my leg that was broken I wish it were my head Then I won't remember anything If I don't remember, it wouldn't hurt so bad But you won't be happy either Last night I had a dream I dreamed of a little boy with a box growing on his head And then? That box is a "memory box" It was shaped like this You could see into the box The little boy was adorable He had memory notes in his box In the dream I saw the little boy's world There was this golden field Ears of wheat swaying in the wind I wish I could be like him and stay there forever Everyday, the little boy would write down his thoughts on little pieces of paper and put them in the box Every once in a while he would clean it out He'd throw away all dark memories and only keep the happy ones But one day something terrible happened The box broke and the wind carried all his notes away He searched everywhere for his lost memories But unfortunately he couldn't find any of them And then? The box was empty and I woke up No way The story can't end here Listen It goes like this One day he went back again to search for his memories The sky was exceptionally blue Floating about were little white clouds and little birds were flying all around chirping and singing Along the way, he met a little girl a beautiful little girl wearing a summer dress with flowers And she could play the violin eventually, they fell in love and were never separated again Everything began anew What a romantic story You could tell it in your next book I'm not in the mood My own memory box hasn't been emptied yet That's because you threw away the key of the box But I found it Wanna see it? Yes, I do But I warn you this might hurt a bit Then, no You won't regret it It'll only take a second No Here it comes Might hurt a little I'm opening it Hold on! Be brave! I'm opening it It's open!

I've done it! Gordon! It's gonna work! Why do you look so upset? Aren't you happy for me? Are you jealous? Sophie If I gave up Joanna would you give up Jeff? What do you meant? Lately, I'm exhausted I don't want to do this anymore I want out I don't want to keep this cooperative relationship with you Why? Because you and Jeff are not right for each other A girl like you needs someone who really understands you who appreciates you Someone someone who wouldn't leave you I think you know that Jeff is not that guy Let's say I help you win Jeff back what's the point? The wedding is less than a month how could I let it go just like that I want him to regret what he's done I want him to know what it's like to be dumped I want him to come apologize a million times And then? In front of everyone with a little smile on my face, I'll say Jeff you're not good enough for me This is the real reason you want Jeff back? Yup You don't need me then you need a psychiatrist I can't help you This is how you solve all of your problems? 5 years ago you had a photo exhibition That was a failure Then, you hide all your works away in your little darkroom Don't you think that's a shame?

Sophie, let me explain Stop! Sophie! Sophie! Sophie! Let me explain Wait, listen! That night at the party you were drunk I don't want to listen to you Listen to me! Sophie, let me explain I told her about you She begged me to be her spy I knew it was wrong but I had no choice You lied to me! I had no choice She's my only family I've raised her since she was 3 years old I just couldn't refuse her! I couldn't refuse her You lied to me! Sophie what happened to your leg, the fall I had nothing to do with it. I swear to God! I fought with her over this Sophie So it was that kind of ending How so... imperfect Although it was an imperfect ending After that night I saw things more clearly and then I fell ill for some time Good morning Thank God You're finally awake If you didn't come back to life soon I would've had to find another bridesmaid Hello Good morning Honey You haven't congratulated me yet I am already divorced! Mom you're such a silly girl Why didn't you just tell me the truth? Because I thought I did something wrong No matter what you do I'll always be there for you I just hope that you learned something from all of this I was scared Of what? I was scared of being hurt The same way Dad hurt you many years ago When you fall in love with someone being hurt is something you can't avoid But it's absolutely worth it I just hope you to be strong and love fearlessly no matter what the cost Just like your mom Once in a life with no regrets because mom has you Hey honey I heard he's getting ready to leave the country Go Sophie Where are you going? I.... You like it? Jeff The flowers are beautiful But they're not right for me It's okay though I'm sue that you will find the right person for them I promise Actually, can I borrow them for while? Thanks! My brother went to Europe He didn't say when he was coming back My brother was serious about you I've never seen him like this before After that I had no news about him So I decided to put our story in a book That way, it may help other people who've been lost like me In hope that they can find themselves and true love All of you in the studio and those at home watching I hope after today's program you will understand Sophie more and have interest in Sophie's new book "Handbook of Love" Sophie You okay?
