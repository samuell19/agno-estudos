Alright? I thought it'd be dad. Well it's me, dickhead. Hurry up! I'm waiting. Hey guys, what on earth are you doing? - Alright? - Cool. How's it hangin? Cool? OK? - So, did you win? - It was just a practice. Oh, Ok. Team spirit then? Matty, get your jammies on so it's done. - Can you come? - OK. Like now? Coconut rice OK, guys? What's up? Where's Dad? I told you. Training with the post office. - Not at Championnet? - No, not at Championnet. Where then? I told you, Matt. I don't know where exactly. Maurienne, in the Alps. There's no mobile reception. That's why he doesn't call. Do you call him? I'll call if there's a problem but there isn't. Now go and play and I'll call you for dinner. Mathis, sweetheart. You must be brave. - Very, very brave. - Why? - We have to be brave. - Why? - You must be brave. - Leave me! - Leave me. - Mathis, hang on. Leave me alone! Stop! - Mathis, lovey! - Stop. Fuck off! You fucking bastards! - Fuck off, will you? - Stop! - Stop! - Leave me! Stop! Matty, stop! - Leave me! - Stop. No! Leave me alone! Mathis! Mathis, come here, please! Hey, Matty. Calm down. Sit down. Come here. Let's tidy you up. - What's this? - My Bart Simpson T-shirt! Your football shirt? You must stink! I don't stink! What do I say about homework again? Jack helps every night. Not every night! But it's a lie! They won't know. Relax. OK? Say what you want to do, OK? Say what you really want. That's what we're here for. To say what we really want, OK? That's what's most important. So much death in the family over the last 4 years. Now Stephane. The children are all alone now. I feel so helpless. Helpless... It's terrible. I feel responsible. Guilty even. We're not here to evaluate things in terms of guilt. Life is as it is. You each have priorities. Our task today is to decide what is best for the children. If we sell the children's flat and ours, we'll be able to think about buying somewhere together. Of course it wouldn't be immediately not before the start of the next school year or... None of us want to live in Lyon. You'd like to stay in Grenoble? Yes. My sister may want to settle here after college. My brother's friends are here. I work here. Why did you give up your studies two years ago? Because... when my mother died I couldn't imagine... I found sitting in a class at the Lycée difficult. I needed real life... something real to ground me. So... anything's possible. I think when Mathis... settles into his studies I'll find it easier to go back to mine. And you, sir? How do you feel about all this? The children are welcome here whenever they want. We're in the mountains here. They know the door's always open. That's all. Matty likes to come don't you, Matty? You like coming to see old uncle Abel? Yes, I like coming to see Nador and Noche and Mr Laury's horses. It's nice and peaceful. With the animals. So, Mathis. Secondary school? An important time for you. You seem to be doing well. What are your favourite subjects? - A bit of everything. - A bit of everything. What about friends? I'm sure you've been told this but I must be sure you understand. It is necessary for you to have a legal guardian who is responsible for you. That's the law. This adult is responsible for your daily life. That means school lunches homework, your timetable, after-school activities. Your future. If Jack is your guardian, he'll have that responsibility. Your responsibility is to listen to him. I do listen to you! I'm sure you listen but you'll have to listen more now. You'll have to listen to your big brother and your guardian! Do you understand? Yes. What I want is to live with Jack and Lisa. Guardians are never just let loose. You submit annual accounts to me to be checked by the court. As subrogate guardian your role is to provide support and keep an eye on things. In our jargon we call you "The Eye". The Eye is watching you. I've put all the bills etc to do with the flat here. Electricity bills, gas bills and all that. Everything to do with the insurance is here. Bank loans are here... I'll put this here. You have 15 days to send this off. Jack are you listening? Jack? Come here. Call me whenever you want. Don't hesitate. - Are you going, uncle? - I won't be far away. If you need me I'm only an hour away. Aha, here's the son! And how's the son doing? Not so good, eh? What do you want? Came to see Stephane. But it might be a bit tricky, eh? Can we come in? I said, what do you want? So sad. I heard it's time to do the accounts. Stay there. At his age your dad used to bring you to poker. You played FIFA on your console while your dad lost everything. See? It's all in here. I have Stephane at my fingertips. Your padre was a right bastard! Fucking addict. That's enough. Mathis, go to your room. Off to your room, Mathis. Off you go, love. - So, what's your name? - Daniloff. Double F. I can't find you in here. I'm in front of you. He can't find me! Steph always was a bit careless. Isn't this his writing? Your dad and me, we were one. We are one. If you were one how come he's dead? Maybe your dad's dead. Maybe I'm alive. Not much difference, eh? That's enough. Goodbye. Thank you. Has uncle gone? You saw him leave. When's he coming back? Maybe he'll be back. Maybe not. So all the adults have gone? I'm the adult, kiddo. OK? What I meant was from now on it's just us. There won't be any "real" adults. Get your arse over here. I'll show you something. Come here. Turn around. - Why? - Bend over. A bit more. And a bit more. - What are you doing? - So? Is it true or not? True or not? Is it in here? Marwan, find your jacket. Hurry up! It was decided... out of the blue. We don't have the same idea of "sleep over". Thank goodness I called. Let's go. Goodbye, Jack. Wow... Do I smell of beer? A bit, yes. - A bit? - Yep. Get a move on! Let's go! Shall I drop you here? In front if you like. What? Last time dad dropped you here because he was late and to say goodbye, you shook hands with him. He told you that? Isn't it true? Why do you keep making me go to school? Everyone does! Marwan, Lucas. They all go. I don't like how teachers treat me. They're all too nice. Of course they're nice. They're not just nice. They're mega nice! Mr Boisson never tells me off. If I got up on the desk and pissed on it he'd go... Well, I got up on the desk... OK, I didn't wee on it but anyway. That's Mr Boisson for you. OK, I'll write a note but not for all the classes. You're not loafing about at home. What do you do when you feel like crying? I go away from everyone, on my own. What if you can't? If I can't I have to prepare an expression. That way when it happens I'm ready for it. Like this... A mask. A mask. - What's the order? - It's returns. But what are they? Go see your brother! He's in the stores. Hey! Bad Brains. - Album? - Banned in DC. - Guitarist? - Gary Miller aka Doctor Know. His mum's dog's name? Joking! Do you think that's funny? You allow that? Christ! You have no respect. You have no respect for the dead. Their room's a pig sty! Do you think this is funny? Well? Did you think about mum? Apparently you don't give a shit! Explain 'cause I don't get it. And close the door! Is it that complicated? And what's this bloody animal doing here? The fridge is disgusting! Stop yelling! Doors open and close! Matty's here with us! I feel sorry for you. What do you want me to do? Tell me. I've no idea. Lock it all away? Death's everywhere, Lisa! Here! There! This was mum's office. She fell here. You got her up! Dad's collection was everywhere! - Shut up! - Shut up? There's no letter! Cowards don't do letters. - Cowards? - Yep. We never saw the body! It's weird! We never saw the body! Don't talk in front of Mathis! It's not weird. It was in shreds. It was filmed. Him on the tracks waiting to kill himself. Look at his text messages. What's this mean? Mercancias listas. It means "merchandise ready". Listen! 223 pedazos. That means 223 items. They never say what it means! The last one from dad: Estaré alli - I'll be there. I called. The guy spoke Spanish. What's it mean? - I don't know. - Well neither do I. I don't give a shit about dad's scheming. - You don't give a shit? - No, I don't. You don't care that he threw himself under a train? You want me to cry? Is that what you'd like? So the Latin language was imposed. Second point: The organisation of the towns. If traces remain today... I'm leaving. - What do you mean? - For good. Jerome's bought a chip van. We're going to the South to work. - Nice ambition. - Shut up. I'm taking my stuff. I'm not leaving anything in this shithole. I'm never coming back. I won't visit their graves. I can never talk to you so I'm saying it now. You and dad just left me to deal with mum's things. Packing up. Giving her clothes away. Because I was the girl. You just wiped your hands of everything. I was fucking fifteen! So, I'm not touching dad's stuff. You can do that. And if you sell his watches I want my share. I cry all the time here. Anywhere else I'm happy. Lisa says we can go and see her when we want. OK, OK. Do you want to go with them? Do you want me to call her? She'll come back and you can go with them? She didn't even suggest it if that makes it any clearer for you. What you up to in the dark? I tidied everything away to make space. So he has his space. I've been taking photos with dad's camera. OK. Come to bed now. I just want to show you what you can do. See how cool this is? The ones of mum were already in there. They've gone. You're the only one who helps me forget the shit. I want you here all night. Breakfast in bed. I like doing it here. When people pass it excites me. Where am I? What do I do? Hey! Jack! Right? I've crashed. Where is it? Reverse. - Alright now? - Straight on. Where am I? Can you see the pizza? Hey, Jack! Am I good? Right? Left? Forwards? Reverse? Tell me what to do! That's pretty mean. You were supposed to stay put. That's dad. His jacket's the same as the guy the other day. Or that guy's got the same jacket as dad. No results found Know why I didn't shower at the club? To not show my boxers. Why not show my boxers? Multicoloured tortoises are too babyish. I wish I hadn't got them. Can we get some new ones? I'll have to look at the budget. What are you doing? Did you do that with mum and dad? Always asking questions? What do you do at night when I'm asleep? - I sleep. - I know that's not true. I wank. Does that suit you? You mean you wank like this? You take your dick out and whack it! He fucking wanks! He wanks off all night! Uncle David! You OK? I'm fine. How are you doing? We're good. We're good. Why did you want that bloke Daniloff's number? No reason. Just out of interest. Well, I haven't got it. Why the interest in guys like him? If you don't have it that's that. Exactly. Exactly. Blokes like that are to be avoided. Is Mathis OK? He's fine. He's fine. We're just having dinner. We're having... ratatouille and... and a green salad. Thanks. Bye. And now he's binging on a turd I shat this morning. He's really enjoying it. Hang on, matey. Don't go 'till I say. Hold on tight, Matty she opens up fast. Man, that was great! Cool! It's a pile of shit! - It's shit! - Shit! - Heap of shit! - Junk! - It was cool. - Shall we go? It was cool. Matty! It was cool! It was cool! It was cool! - What's up, kiddo? - Fuck off! - Fuck off! - Stop. Stop, don't cry. Crying won't help. - Stop crying. - Leave me alone! Go away! Stop! Stop crying! Stop! OK? Then we came home. I took him to McDonalds to cheer him up. So sad. Matty... The other day, with Quentin and Raf, we were talking about the summer holidays. Raf was there "my folks this and that" all in front of Matty who said nothing. It doesn't matter. He'll get used to it. That won't stop. I could have punched that jerk. He kept on "my old man'd never let me"... How'd you feel if your parents died? What do you mean? I'd go mad. Especially my mum. How do you know? You're looking at me like you're fascinated. That's why you like me. Do you have to be such a shit? Hang on. Let's do a little experiment. Watch Matty. Look at him. Watch Matty. You see? Now we're all crying. Bastard! Bastard! You like that! You're the bastard! Stop! Maureen! Stop it! That's enough. It's OK. It's OK. No more tears. Jack? Yes, kiddo. I've got to go or I'll be late. Off you go then. See you tonight. I'm gonna burn you up! Headcase! Dickhead! Hey. You should come to bed. It's late. You're staying then. Night, Turkie. MY FATHER IS A SNAKE. THE SLOB WHO PLAYED POKER WHILE I PLAYED FIFA. Where are you? You should've been here on the 16th. We're waiting here like pricks, you fucker. Stephane is dead. Your goods are ready, fuckwit. What did you take? Cows. I didn't see them. I didn't get a good shot. Noche! So you're off to live in Spain? No! Spain's just for a holiday. We'll be back after. Nador! Did you answer everyone who wrote to you? I will. You could get a little card printed. It's customary. People do that by e-mail now, uncle. I imagine Savel wrote to you. You won't remember him, you were little. Who's Savel? Savel was the joker of the gang. Your dad was always fooling around with him. There was one. He was your dad's big mate. They were inseparable. They were close but we never met him? You knew him when you were small! He wasn't called Daniloff? Tall? Dark hair? No, that wasn't him. He wasn't very tall. Have you got photos? Well... Your dad... They fell out... so your dad chucked 'em. He could be very hot headed... He knows, he's seen him in action. It was in his blood. He was kind and violent. He had those two in him. He was inhabited. I'm cold. Know what a man told me? No. One day I'd tire of sunsets. I'd like them less. What a madman! So what do I have to do for the animal? Give it a bit of lettuce and leftovers. Uncle, you know we'd have liked to come with you to Saint Pierre but Matty wants to breathe in the sea air. Off you go and breathe in some sea air. How you doing, Barcelona? From here... to here. All that belongs to Stephane. Understand? Did you bring a lorry? Van? The five thousand euros... No ham, no ham. No, sorry... I don't know your dad. I don't know your father. I don't know him. Look, from here to here is paid for. You take it. I don't know him. You either take it or you leave it! Shame we couldn't take it all! - We'll try chic joints on the coast. - Put the aircon back on. Like Italian joints, you know? Matty! Matty! Mathis! He's so cute taking his photos. I'll hold your camera. Go and play. Leave me the camera. No, I'm not a film star. Leave it with me and go play. Don't worry. I'll hold it. I'll keep it. Go and play. - Thanks. - You're welcome! You knew I wasn't far away! You know what? Next time piss off for good. Make my life simpler. Your eyes have a crazy look. Like dad. Quentin and you do what you like and I never moan. - Don't you like Spain? - It's cool. But I'm bored! And you take stuff which tires you. Stop playing the adult 'cause no one else is. Idiotto! And we have ham as well now! Just giving you my opinion. Arse holo! Alright you snotty-nosed brat! But we're on holiday, too, OK? Cruddy little poofter. I hear you, slimy shitface but I'd like my opinion considered if you don't mind, high flying wankers who think they're top shit but who are petty pushers. Hey, fat pig motherfucker who fell from my anus, let's get a crap card for uncle Abel, that hot piss stinking tosser. Not in public, thank you. Sonofabitch we're in Spain! No one understands. Understand-o, wanker-o? That's enough, OK? You think they don't understand? No worries. Provincia, provincia Francia. Five euros for that. Five euros for that? Oh, come on, it's bueno! Hey, cool it on the beer. Dickhead. What's up? As you said they don't understand! Go dance with the lady. There's no room in here! Fuck! Fucking shit! It stinks of dead meat! It stinks of dead meat! OK, Matty! It stinks of dead meat! Fucking hell! Are you OK? Have some water. Wipe your mouth. A bit more. Let's get this off you. You alright? Do you still love it? Yes. I bought the purchase deeds to save time. I meant to tell you before then... They called when we were in Spain. It was all very quick. How was Spain? Great. 220's a good price. We should get 250 for mine. That's not far off 500. We ought to get something good for that. I know you're not happy. You're not happy. I'm sure you think I don't do enough for you. But whatever I suggest, you're never happy. It's not that. It's the family I'm scared of. I know. I think about that too. Sometimes I think we're jinxed. I think of my parents, my grandparents. Their ideas. What was "right". All that for what? So everyone snuffs it? I'll never live my life like you! Never! Well done. You're young. You know it all. In fact, you know nothing. Well? So tell me! Tell me all about it. I'm all ears. You do what you want, Jack. But I won't allow you carte blanche. You're not alone. So if that means us having Mathis we'll have him. I hope that's clear for you. Don't you worry. It is. I know you think I'm an idiot and that we messed up. I know why you went to Spain. And I know what you found there. Nothing. There was nothing to find except your dad's pathetic fuck ups. Your dad died because he'd had enough. It was over for him. That's why people kill themselves. There's no other reason. That's the mystery you're looking for. Aren't you going to Maureen's? Later. Are you sleeping in Marwan's room? - Yep. Do you want to talk to his mum? - No. Have your brushed your teeth? Yes. See you tomorrow, then. OK. Jack, it's me. I'm calling to tell you I can't find the iguana. Don't worry, uncle. It doesn't matter. It must have escaped. Jack! Come on! Know what I thought in the train? No. I've come from Grenoble to see you both. To see you. I'm in love. What's the matter? Did I say a rude word? In love. In love. Is it OK living with your sis? I don't live with her. Near her. It's OK. It's good for Matty. The memories of before are fading. What do you think? I found it the day we arrived. Hello! Good morning! Quietly, please. Sit down, please. So, dear students of 5b. Today's the 1st day for teachers and students. I'm Mr Melikian. I'm your form teacher and your maths teacher this year. So I can get to know you there's a form to fill out and some questions to answer. You can answer any, some or all of the questions or none if you think the form is too intrusive. I've filled the form out, too. If you look at the board you'll see I like football and tennis. You can do the same to give me an idea of your character so I'll know more about you. Any questions just ask. Parents: Deceased. Yes? - Your name is? - Melinda. Go ahead, Melinda. If our parents are deceased do we still put the profession? I mean what they did before... it's for my father. Just fill it out as you would normally. That will give us the info that we teachers need. We can talk about your family situation after class. That's also my role... So, do you like it? Do you think you're Santa? You should see my room at uni. - Why are you so nice to me? - You know why. Tell me again. 'Cause you're my girl. And I fancy you. Oh, yeah? Really? Really? Melinda? With crazy irresponsible parents? - Why do you say that? - Dunno. Who the hell would call their kid Melinda? So she's in your face with that the 1st day. We had to put our parents' professions. She asked if we had to, even if they were dead. So after break I sat next to her. So you thought, "She's in the same shit as me, might as well be friends and wallow in it". Is that it? Melinda. Wash your hands and I'll tell you if you can go on seeing her. OK? I always wash my hands. You don't need to tell me. I'll keep seeing her, like it or not. Melinda! Melinda! And your $8 000 000 shit telly? What's it like? If you used my share, I'll kill you. Guess who called yesterday? Vanessa Bouillette. Vanessa? The blonde from Polangis avenue? - Yeps. - Are we still friends? You should call her. We'll invite Vaness. Do things properly. Listen to him! Am I hearing right? We... we... we! You're a kid. Stop the "we". Seriously, who's he think he is? Do you believe it? He's right. Oh, yeah! Here. We made a list for my personal development. OK. "I promise to take Mathis Certy aka Matty seriously. To be attentive to him, consider his wishes feelings and sensations and how he expresses them." "In exchange, Mathis Certy promises to communicate simply without sulking for no understandable reason." Serious stuff! Quite! Matt dictated every word. I just wrote it. Jack, Maureen and I've all signed. Your turn. So you sulk without reason? We're closing next weekend. The season's over. Come round. - Maur, if you're here, come by. - OK. What are you doing? Did you look at uncle's photos of mum and dad? No. I'm not like you. I don't like all that stuff. Really? I love all that. I dig it. Good for you. I don't. Stop it! Tell me, besides chips does anything else interest you? Happiness... flogging a few chips. Don't you give a shit about anything? You're sick! You're a madman! Fucking bastard. All there is to know is that from now on we're on our own! Their past is looped in my head, bitch! Fuck off, moron! You're just a good-for-nothing. Fucking mad man! I don't think my fag's lit. Oh, fuck me. Night, mum. Tell Matty to come and say goodnight to me. I need a bedtime kiss. Please, Madam. Great weekend. Fucking hell. Mathis! Come here! Matty! An N3, each way please. ...accompanied by Risky Star. They've just completed the first lap... We'll lose again if we copy them. No, they're regulars. They win all the time. Their luck will change. OK, we bet their numbers and then 100 euros on what you choose. OK, number 9. Number 9? 300 on number 9 as you're on a roll. 300? You're nuts! You're insane! 300 on number 9 to win, please. He's passed him. He's leading! He's done it! Hey! We won! Steady on. You'll get stomach ache. Why wasn't I allowed to go to mum's funeral? You were too small. Dad wanted you to stay with me. I didn't see her either. That wasn't right. No, it wasn't. Wipe your mouth. You alright? Do you want a drink? What was that about? Beautiful... Stop it! Look. Do you like them? The really good ones often take photos of awful things. Like murders or dead animals. And sometimes it's flowers. They do both. And dancers? Could I come to your class to take photos? You answer Jack's phone? Jack worked all night. He's asleep. - So, he's got a job! - Yes. Doing what? Er... He's making pasta shells. - How do you get to school? - Bike. Tell Jack to call me. I can't get in the account. He changed the codes. He calls back or I contact the judge. - Is that clear? You'll tell him? - Yes. The Eye called. Call back ASAP, Jack-ass! Warning! Danger. She says it's best for me to be away from here because of my dad. What about the weekends? I won't be on my own. I'll be with my sister. We'll come here for holidays. Boarding school's easier for my mum. When do you go? Today's my last day. But I'm going to get a phone. I'll call. - No, you won't. - I will! We say we will, but we don't. In you go. What's the matter, Mathis? Nothing. Come out, please. You have children, right? Yes. They're only little. Is it because of your parents that you're crying? My mum's hair was like yours. Say something nice to me. Lie to me! Say you'll always be there. Nothing will happen to you. Lie! Lie! I'll always be here. Nothing will ever happen to you. Nothing will ever happen to me. It's not that. You don't understand. The money just slips through my fingers. I don't get dead people's money, inheritance. Nor do you. Yeah, I know. I'm too stupid, right? I don't have dead parents. I'm going back to Grenoble. Oh, Maur, stop it. Please. Stop it. I don't know why I'm here. If I go will you try and stop me? Know what my medium said? Yes, I go to see a medium. My mum and my sister do, too. My whole family is interested in the future! I gave her a T-shirt, a letter, some hair. Some hair? Yeah, from your head! Well about the letter... your handwriting. It's not clairvoyance, it's graphology so you can't say it's bullshit! Look! Your letters and strokes point backwards. Here, here and here! You're stuck in the past! It's inscribed in your head. It's sad because everyone thinks you're so mature above all you! But it's stopping you growing up. Growing into a man. It's also sad 'cause you don't give a toss. Come here! Uncle's here. With Sidonie? No, Sidonie's not here. He's come to give me shit. He doesn't need Sidonie for that. Money's not the problem. I haven't spent it all! I'm not stupid. - So we can't go back to the trailer? - Of course we can! He'll go soon. I called Clovis. He let him in. He's waiting. We'll sort it out. What if you go to jail? Don't talk nonsense! Of course not! So why's uncle here? Why don't you call? Why are we hiding? You'll go to prison. I'll be in the orphanage. That's what you meant in Spain. You don't want to keep me with you. You spent the money so of course it's gone. I thought when mum and dad died we'd be closer but you want to be free and alone. Well I'm alone, too. It's happened. I'll be alone all my life because of you! So you squealed on me to the judge? Is that what you think of me? What will you do? I don't know what I'm going to do. Right now I'm trying to understand. There's nothing to understand. That's what you said in Grenoble. Lisa said that too. There's nothing to understand. Look. Sidonie's baby. Faustine. 8 weeks old. What do you think? Pretty isn't she? Well? She's beautiful. There you are. Say what you think. I believe in you. Do you think I'd have let you get this far? I believe in you. I'm free now. I'm completely free. But there's this immense thing in front of me. I need to re-invent something for Matty, Lisa and me. I know what you expect of me. I've known from the start. When mum died dad totally lost it. He was so lost in sorrow. He was a zombie. Stoned on medication and alcohol. But I had to keep going. Like a machine. Like a normal machine keeping everything normal. Because all around was chaos and shit. But my brain... this brain... is like a haunted house. Haunted by the dead and sadness. And I'm a kid. I'm just a fucking kid. Lost in all this shit. I can't do it. I'm cursed. I'm not good enough. It stinks of rotten flesh here. Cunt! Get your arse over here, snake skin. Jack, come on. Rotten flesh? Are you sure? I think it stinks of something else. Don't worry. Just relax. Run, Matty! Run! Turkie! Jack! Lisa! Matty! Jack! I can't lose you! I can't lose you. If I lose you, I lose everything! Keep the fag in your mouth. Look left. Look up. Hold it. Why aren't you talking? Are you traumatised? Marwan's grandpa's really old. Like uncle Abel. Marwan says he's like a baby. They have to feed him. When he talks he goes... And he has to wear nappies. When you're old you can come to mine. That's nice of you. It'll be my turn. I'll take care of everything. Are you glad I said that? Very. I think that's her. Wow! That's crazy isn't it? Who? Meli. I told you about her. - Who? - Melinda! Mathis! Matty! Show me, which one's her?
