Oh! It must be December 5th. Mm-hmm. Grandma is always right on time. Oh, my gosh. I love when you get in your design moods. Your Santa's workshop theme you had last year blew my mind. Merry Christmas, Grandma. Remind me what filling shoes with candy has to do with Christmas? Well, it's a Dutch tradition. St. Nicholas Eve, children they put their shoes by the fireplace for Sinterklaas to fill with candies and presents. So, like a knock-off Santa Clause? Whoa! Whoa! Sinterklaas was Santa before Santa went mainstream, okay? Sorry, I didn't know you were a Christmas hipster, No, Grandma, she is the Christmas hipster. She just-- she loves tradition and she always sends me a pair of shows filled with candies. "These are the shoes I wore when I met your grandfather and took my first steps toward my future." Aw! "May they guide you towards your dreams and bring you some Christmas magic." Magic? You didn't tell me the shoes had magic! Well, she thinks that they're magic but I've had my fair share of ups and downs with them. Boo! Magic is not real. But sure do like wearing all my Christmas shoes. Christmas shoe season has begun. So what's the magic behind these ones again? Something about sticky situations. Because they're bubble-gum pink? Yep, and she even filled them with bubble-gum that year. Look, it's lunch time. Do you want to go do some Christmas shopping? Yeah. You had me at lunch. Let's go. You know, I am so glad we didn't waste a lunchbreak actually eating lunch. I had to get my parents Christmas gifts. Here, have a cookie. You know, last time I spent the holidays with my grandmother in the Netherlands, their gifts, they barely made it there on time. Well, it's okay. I got a great dress for my Christmas party, although I think I'm going to have to skip these cookies if want this to fit, so. Your loss. Oh, you know what? I just have to make one more stop at Reid's Candy. You go ahead. More gifts? You're putting Santa to shame. No, this one, it's-- it's really special. My Dad, he proposed to my mom there with a peppermint ring when they were teenagers. What? I didn't know your parents were high school sweethearts. Yeah. He always said that he knew she was the one the first moment he laid his eyes on her, but that was the only ring that he could afford, so now I just-- I always like to get them something special this time of year. That is so sweet. You are such a secret romantic. Reid's Candies and that peppermint ring, that's the only thing that makes me believe that romance is still alive, so. Well, I hope so. Do me a favor, pick me up one of those peppermint rings. I think I need one. Done. What? Oh! Ugh! Really? - Oh! - Looks like you're stuck there. Excuse me? The bubble-gum. Uh, yeah. I guess so. Would you mind? May I? Sure. It's not the first sticky situation I've gotten out of. Thank you. I can't believe that they're closing this location. What kind of Grinch's run this place? You must really love this store. I do. You know that they make the best candy canes. I do. I had my first job here. - Really? - Yup. Thank you. John Reid. Excuse me. John Reid. It's Reid's Candy. That's John. Oh. These numbers are underwhelming to say the least. We've got to do something about this. Smells so good. John: Can I help you? I see you found the candy canes. Hi. Look, I'm really sorry about the Grinch thing. Don't sweat it. It's fine. I just-- I really-- I can't believe that this is my last Christmas at this Reid's. John: Well, it doesn't have to be. Stop by any other location. Time Square, very popular. Thank you, but it's really not the same. Yeah. I wish more people saw it that way. If I'm being honest, it's my father's decision. The profit's just way down here. Maybe I could help. What, are you going to buy the entire inventory? No, I would love to, but no. I'm actually a CPA, so if you want, I could look at your numbers. Maybe just a few financial tweaks here and there could increase sales and then, who knows? Maybe this Reid's Candy could live to see another Christmas. Well, my father does believe in numbers. Yeah, well, he's smart 'cause numbers, they never lie. And neither do you from what I can tell. So, look, if you want, here's my card. We're just at Wiltern CPA up the street. Um, if you're interested. Yeah, I'm interested. This afternoon, does that work? Sure. Yeah. I think that works. All right. Great. Candy cane. On the house. Thank you. I'll see you later. See you later. Yeah? Uh, hello. Hot date? What? No. Why? Well, you've cleaned your entire desk and checked your makeup twice since lunch. Something's happening. I, um, I may have gotten into a sticky situation. Okay, hold on. I'll be right there. What happened? That Reid's Candy store location, they're closing it. - Can you believe that? - No! Don't they know that that is a landmark of love? That's funny. That's very funny. So I may have, um, insulted the owner. How? I kind of called him a Grinch. What, he ban you for life? No. No, he didn't. I mean, he scraped gum off my shoe and then I offered to look at his books. - What? - Wait. Didn't your grandma give you these shoes to get you out of sticky situations? Maybe, kind of. Oh, my gosh. They are totally magical. No! No, they're no magical because I wore my magical Christmas shoes on one of the worst days ever. You know, it really snapped me out of believing in the magic of them and any silly notion of me becoming and interior designer. You were wearing your shoes that day? Yes, the day I lost my internship and my boyfriend. Oh, well, it's more like your boyfriend stole your ideas and your internship. There's no reason to blame your shoes for that. You're projecting. And this, it's just a coincidence. Noelle, you literally stepped in bubble-gum. There are no such thing as coincidences. Whoa. If that is John, you need to change into your red pumps ASAP. They're not magic. - Yes, they are. - They're not magic. Hey, Noelle. Is this a good time? Absolutely, yes. Allison, this is John Reid. - Hi. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Noelle is thrilled to get started on your looks. Books. Books. Allison has had a really long day, haven't you? Yes. I'm sorry. Let me get you a chair. That'd be great. Thanks. - Oh! - Down payment. Oh, Thank you. These are my favorite. Consider yourself paid in full. I love these. Thank you. - Here. Here you go. - Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks, Allison. Have a seat. Just have a look at these numbers. These are cute. Oh, thank you. Thank you. And that? That's an early Christmas gift? Yes, that's from my grandmother. Would you mind if I read this? Sure. Wow. That is sweet. You got some grandma there. Yeah, she always includes a note, it's supposed to help with the magic, or so she believes. So, what do you think? Well, your numbers, they're on a giant decline. have you had a bad Yelp review or? No, we have excellent customer service, I make sure of that. - That's it! - Did I get a bad review? No, look at-- you have these beautiful windows and there's nothing in them. So, what do I do? Like, a big neon sign in the window? One of those inflatable like, tubey guys? Giant candy cane? No. You need something that is just going to stop people in their tracks. I think I have an idea. Look, I don't know. I would have to be pretty spectacular. We'd have to hire a designer and where are we going to find on such short notice? It's already December 5th. Well, you're in luck. Already found. - You? - Mm-hmm. You're an accountant. Well, I'm a very creative one. I love your store. I know exactly what to do. I mean, this Christmas nobody is walking by Reid's window. Right, okay. What have I got to lose? - Really? -Yeah. Okay. You've got to trust me. John: All right. I'll let you in and have at it. Noelle: Okay. Thank you. -Good luck with that. - Thanks. Stop! Stop! Stop! Uh, what happened? It looks like you did the walk of shame from Santa's village. Oh. Anyways, what is so urgent that I had to miss yoga? This coffee for starters, and I just-- I really need a second opinion before John sees it. Oh. Okay. And close your eyes. Just humor me. Okay. This way. And we're walking. And we're walking, A little step here. - Keep walking. - Mm-hmm. And, open them. Allison: Oh, wow! - You did this? - Yeah. Are those little Christmas shoes? Yes. Yes. They look exactly like the first pair my grandmother gave me and that Christmas I took my very first steps and she just swore that the shoes had Christmas magic in them. Look at this. It draws me in. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. It's good to see you creative again. It gives you a glow. Oh, stop it. It does feel good though, you know? It feels like I'm flexing an unused muscle. Okay, well, I'm going to go back to the office. You need to get this-- what is that? Pine needles. Garland. Out of your hair. I'll cover for you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Great little window over there. There's a great window across the street. Yes! Merry Christmas. Thank you so much. Thank you. Please, come on in. Merry Christmas. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Hi. Hey. Hey, look at you, Ginger Rogers. Don't stop dancing on my account. Just happened to be in the area. Thought I'd check it out. Well, that is great work. People seem to really love it. The store's been busy all morning. You don't think that it's just a little over the top? No, not at all. Normal is boring, and that is definitely not normal. I come by it honestly. All right. Let's check the numbers. Noelle: Okay. Everything okay? - It's not good. - What? What do you mean? It's great. Single day record sales and we are not even done yet. You're very funny. Thank you. And you're very talented. You know, I would hire you to design another window but I'm sure my accountant would say I can't afford it. Hmm. But if your designer works for candy, I think that your accountant would say to go for it. Really? All right. Would you do me the honor of designing me another window? Oh-- It's-- I can pay you. I'm just joking. I'm just being silly. No! Yes! I do. I do, um, I agree to do another window for you. Sure. Okay. Great. Excuse the bad jokes, all right? Just keep sprinkling your Christmas magic, let Rich know, he's the manager, if you need anything. Wait a minute, so you're leaving? Yeah, I got to get to corporate. If we're going to save this store, Dad needs to see these record sales ASAP. Right. Right. Right. Right. I hope you got some more sweet ideas. I have a whole closet of inspiration. I look forward to it. Uh! John: Dad! I saw the future of Reid's Candies today. That's great, Son. Our Maple Street store was packed, would you like to know why? Let's see, it's Christmas? People buy candy? The windows, they were decorated with these Christmas shoes. What do shoes have to do with candy? Well, they were these Dutch wooden shoes with candy in it, right next to a Christmas tree and our candy was the centerpiece. The point is, it became a Christmas attraction, it drew people into the store to buy candy. Take a look at the numbers. Wow. Those are impressive sales. Exactly, right? Why don't we let each store create their own window with their own artistic interpretation of Reid's Candies at Christmas? Yeah, you see, that's the artist in you speaking, and if you want to become CEO of this company you are going to have to have a little more business savvy. Can you just let me work with this one store, please? I'll admit the numbers are good, all right? But every location has good days. Right. Look, I'll tell you what, you dress another window and if you can replicate those sales we'll talk about your idea. You got yourself a deal. Ah! Hi. Oh, yeah! Yeah, everybody loves your dancing, Ms. Dancing Machine. Somebody is on a sugar high. Here, I think you need this. Its' actually a Christmas high. - Oh. - Guess what? The window was a huge success and John, he asked me to create another window, so. - No. - Yeah. Allison, I just, I forgot how much I love designing. I always knew that designing was your calling. I don't know how you ended up in accounting. Mm. More control. I get to call the shots and I get to do things on my own terms. But at what cost? John: Hey. - Hi! - Am I interrupting? - No. - Yeah, no, no. Noelle was just tap dancing. Wow. Yeah, I have-- I got to go. You're not wearing a watch. You're a dancer? You practically fell over when you stepped in gum. Thank you for reminding me. No, I'm not a dancer but my grandmother, she gave me these tap shoes one Christmas, so. John: Those are tap shoes? Noelle: Mm-hmm. Well, I had them re-soled so I could, you know, wear them in the real world. Please, don't let me stop you dancing. - Please. Come on. - Oh. No, I did my encore for good. So, listen, the spike in sales, do you think that that's going to help save the location? Possibly. That's why I'm here. Um. Can we redesign a new window tonight? Tonight? I know it's a quick turnaround but my dad said that if we can replicate those numbers with a new display, that maybe he'll start listening to my ideas and possibly save the Maple Street location. - John! That's amazing! - Yes, I know. Uh, okay. I don't usually do spontaneity but I could come up with some ideas. Okay, great. How can I help? Oh, that's-- you know, I really-- I just-- I like to work solo on things. Yeah, okay. Um, well, I do have an artistic background so if you change your mind. Maybe. Okay, I understand. I'll go let the manager know that you're going to be working all night by yourself. - Okay. - Okay. - Good luck. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Solo act, are you kidding me? What, are you-- your hiding there? - Duh! Listen, what were you thinking? What do you mean, "What am I thinking?" I-- you know what? I'm thinking that I like to work alone. You need to let go of these control issues. No, okay? No. I've been down that path and I'm not going down it again. Okay. Show me your new design ideas. Well, I was thinking about sticking to what works best: the magical Christmas shoes. - What are you doing here? - Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Sorry. I mean, I told you that I didn't need any help. Yeah, well. You're not a little bit happy to see me? Just-- I caught you there. Thank you. So what? Were you just watching me this whole time? Not the whole time, no. That'd be creepy. Well, I know when an artist is in the zone so I'm going to leave you alone. I mean, you don't have to, it is your store after all. That's a good point. I make a mean coco. I would love a coco. - Okay. - Okay. So I see you stuck with the shoe theme. Mm-hmm. What's the story behind the magical Christmas tap shoes? Well, freshman year of high school I auditioned for the lead in "A White Christmas" and I thought it was going to be the start of an illustrious Broadway career. And there was an elaborate tap dance number for the role that I thought I could somehow magically pull off with zero experience and a nice pair of shoes. Of course. How could you not? So my grandmother, she always encourages me to, you know, chase after my dreams and she sent me this pair for Christmas. And you went on to glowing reviews and a full page spread in the yearbook and a full ride to Julliard, right? Absolutely... not. No, I bombed it. It was really bad. I didn't even make the chorus. But I did join the art department and we made some great sets and that's when I found my love for design. So you did chase your dream by following your heart, not as a dancer but as an artist. Proving your grandmother right, Christmas dreams really do come true. Am I right? I mean, I've never thought about it like that but I guess you are. You know, I love the use of the watercolors on the audience, it provides balance and depth without drawing your eye away from the focus which is the shoes. It's quite spectacular. You really sound like you know what you're talking about. Yeah, a little. I had four years at the Royal College of Art. Wow! Seems like an odd choice for a future CEO. Yup. That's what my dad thought too, and he was right. I guess, yeah, sometimes I wish I took a shot but I couldn't walk away from the family business. But are you happy? Happy? It's been a while since someone asked me that. Um. Sure, I'm happy. Yeah. Of course I'm happy. Oh, that's-- that's a ringing endorsement for happiness if I ever heard one. You're right. Yeah. Um. All right. If I'm being honest, the business is my dad's dream. Don't get me wrong, I love the company, and you know, especially how we bring together people at Christmas, especially the kids, you know? Their excitement is the best part. Yeah, but I do wish that he saw me for me instead of what he wants me to be. Right. Your window is-- looks awesome. Oh! It's not even finished yet. Hey, I know this artist that's got a background in candy, loves Christmas, available on short notice. Maybe he could help me. Okay, so, what do you think so far? Sorry. Ah! It looks so good! Not too bad for a couple hours work. Yeah, that was the most fun I've had working in the store probably ever. - Really? - Yeah. Do you really have a story for every one of your magical Christmas shoes? Mm-hmm. There's a story for every one. Although, I'm not so sure about the magic. - You have a lot of them? - I do. I have an entire bedroom closet full of them. I'd love to see your bedroom. Your-- I-- Your bedroom closet, for the shoes and the stories. The windows, right? The windows. I mean, tomorrow Allison and I were going to go Christmas tree shopping, if you want to come and then you could swing by after and see the shoes. Yeah. I'd like that. Okay. Okay. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. Seriously, it's not like that. Merry Christmas. This guy is not Mark. You can't control everything. Sometimes you might just catch some feelings. Okay, look. This might sounds crazy but I-- I think there might be something going on with the shoes because I-- so, I wore the bubble-gum ones and I actually stepped in gum, and then I wore the tap shoes meant for chasing my dreams-- And then you found yourself back into design. Like I told you, there is no such thing as a coincidence. So, tell me, what's the story behind these boots? Uh. I went to the Netherlands to visit my grandmother a few years again and-- That's so cute. Is that a windmill? Mm-hmm. It's very Dutch. And she said it would always bring me what I want. So maybe that means finding my perfect Christmas tree. Okay, maybe not just a tree, maybe it'll help you find something else that you want, or need. - Hi. - Hi. Congratulations. You made a Christmas must-see list. Looks like your shoes still got it. So. Oh. Oh. Uh. My neighbor needs me. I got to go. Your phone didn't even ring. It buzzed. It's on silent. Yeah, she needs my help. It's urgent. You guys are fine, right? I am if you are. - Of course. - Great. Okay. She's really eager to help her neighbor, huh? Yes, that is-- that's Allison, always eager to help, even when you don't need her. - Well then. All right. Here we are! You got it? John: Yeah, I got it. Okay, right this way. If I'd have known I definitely would have made the case for a skinnier tree. Yeah, maybe one that went to Pilates. Oh yeah? Well, maybe the tree's thinking the same thing about you. I spin. Can you make it another 10 feet or would you like a glass of water? Here. I'll take the water. The cleared out corner with the stand? Actually, upstairs, if you don't mind. We're at the joking phase, huh? There you go. Thanks. It looks amazing! Thank you so much, I really appreciate this. No problem. John: So. So. Do I get to see the magical Christmas shoes? The shoes, right. Okay. You asked for it. Tah-dah! Wow. This is impressive. Every year, huh? Every year without fail and each of them has a note. Where do we start? Well, you have to pick one. Okay. Nope! Close your eyes. - Really? - These are the rules. Oh my. I'm like a three-year-old. Yup. Stop. I'm in the exact same spot. Feel better? - Mm-hmm. - Okay, good. I'm going for it. Oh! Hmm. Oh! Wow! These are sexy. Look at these. I can only imagine the magic you created in these. Of course you had to pick these one first. "This Christmas take comfort in grace rather than style." Yes, Grandma was not kidding. These are the definition of comfort. Hey, I broke my toe that year and these really killed a lot of my Christmas looks. I'm sure you still pulled off some looks. Hmm. Well, thank you. How about your favorite? Oh, that's hard. My favorite? John: Mm-hmm. Um. Mm. I mean. Excuse me. Ready? Ready. Are you ready? Whoa. Those are very Santa baby. By far my favorite. I can only imagine what kind of windows these would inspire. What's the story? "This Christmas don't dwell on Mark, The magic here is a conversation starter to light a spark." A minx and a poet. Well, she is from Amsterdam. These are brand new. I know, I've never actually worn those. You've never been ice-skating? Oh, I've been ice-skating, just not in those. But it's been a really long time. Same for me. It's like riding a bike, though, right? Is it? How about we go tomorrow night? No, I'm not in the mood to break my ankle. I will not let you fall, I promise. We should, uh... Yeah, the tree. Yes, I mean, it's not gonna decorate itself. Ready for another one? Indeed. This is a good one. Oh, the magical Christmas shoes, ornament version. Very nice. Well, they are my heritage. It would not be Christmas without them. I almost forgot. It's perfect. It's a windmill. Yeah, I saw it at the register, and I thought immediately of you. Uh... It's Dutch, right? Yes, yes. Windmills, they are definitely Dutch. Thank you, I love it. It's gonna look really good right... there. Thank you! Have you always believed the shoes were magical? Oh, no, no. Not all of them have a happy ending, which is why my practical side doesn't let me get carried away with it. Well, I see how they inspire your windows, and I definitely believe there's magic in them. I can see it. My grandmother would love you. Yeah, most grandmas do. You know what I'm thinking? Hey, maybe next year, we can package wooden shoes and candy. That is a great idea. And what if we added little paints, so that the children, they could paint their magical Christmas wishes on them. I absolutely love it. Yeah, which means my dad will hate it. So, where did you get your love for art? My mom. She'd take me around to see all the Christmas windows, and yeah, my favorite ones were the painted ones. And so, when I was ten, I painted all the windows in our house to surprise her. Poinsettias were her favorite, and of course, she loved it. She cried when we had to take it down for Easter, but... Oh! I love that. So, is that when you decided you were an artist? Yeah, pretty much, but you know, I always knew it'd be a pipe dream. When your last name is Reid, your candied future is pretty much written for you. Not necessarily. It's your life. You know, I had to learn the hard way, and it's important to take control. Right, that's why you're an accountant? Absolutely. I mean, I get to choose who my clients are, make my own hours, I can just do things on my terms. And you never wanted to do anything creative? I mean, I did, and then... and then, I didn't. Actually, in my first-- excuse me-- year in college, I was up for this prestigious internship at a high-end design firm. What happened? Well, my boyfriend at the time, Mark... Oh, Mr. Sexy Boots Mark. Yes! Mr. Sexy Boots Mark. He was also applying for it. And we, um... we always would work our presentations together, but we had very different styles. I like to tell a story through my work. I feel like it adds a personal touch to the design. But Mark, he convinced me that it wasn't professional. So, at the last minute, I changed my entire portfolio, and at the final meeting, I marched in there with my magic Christmas shoes, determined to be professional. And I bombed it. So, you didn't go with your gut, or stick to your own terms. Exactly. And to make matters worse, Mark, he then used my style of storytelling design in his interview, and he got the internship and now, he has an illustrious design career. So, cheers, Mark. To Mark, what a great guy. And that's how I lost my faith in the fabled magical Christmas shoes. So, you stopped doing something that you love and you gave up magic all because of this guy Mark? No, I... I mean, I chose to pivot. I love design, but I also love a career that has less heartbreak. Well, if it wasn't for this Mark guy, I would have never met you, and your shoes. Well, that is a perk. It's getting late, isn't it? I should get going. Yes, it is. Well, thank you again. My pleasure. Mm. Okay, good night Good night. Night, Noelle. Good night. "This Christmas, go with the flow and laugh along the way." Whoa, hey! What? Ah! No pouring and texting! Thank you. You're all smiles today. Is a certain candy man making this Christmas extra sweet? Gross! Would you listen to yourself? Hey, I am an expert in energy, and I was feeling some serious vibes from you two last night. John and I, we are just friends. Who were you texting? John. It is not like that. He is sending me articles of our window. We're in all the holiday must-see lists. He is so dreamy. Any red-blooded woman would want to unwrap him Christmas morning. Would you listen to yourself? If there's one thing that Mark did teach me, it's not to date people you work with. He's not your boss. And more importantly, he's not Mark-- Mark? This can't be good. Hey! Mark. What-What are you doing here? I'm home for Christmas. You know, seeing the family and play with the little cousins and the nephews. Have you seen the Reid store window yet? That thing is amazing! It's the talk of the town. And rumor is that... well, that you're the genius behind it. Well, the rumors are true. Hey, Allison. Hey, Mark. It's just for Christmas, and it's not a big deal. Ah. Can, uh, can we chat? Oh! Right. Ahem, what is this, a peace offering? I remembered they were your favorite. You know, it's Christmas. Okay, well, the Reid store window is quite the sensation. I never know that you were getting back into design. I'm not. Why? Come work for me. I need a good designer. I'm serious. My new company is ready to launch. Come and have a drink with me tonight, and I'll give you the details. No, I-I have plans. Cancel them. This could be a new career for the both of us. Thank you, but I have a career. and I left that silly fantasy of becoming a designer a long time ago. Hey, look, at least entertain the idea. Just hear me out before you say no. Look, listen. I know that we have a rocky past. That's an understatement. You deserved that internship, not me. Mm-hmm. So, let me make it right. Listen, if you hate what I say, you can throw your drink in my face. Oh, can I come? Please? No, I'll hear him out. But not tonight. And you should bring goggles, because I hear that vodka, it really stings your eyes. I heard that, too! Amazing, well, okay. We'll set something up before Christmas. Well, you ladies have a good day. So, was that the angry speech that you've been rehearsing all these years? Funny. No, he just... He just gets under my skin and makes me feel all these feelings. Allison: Ew, really? You know, I never knew what you saw in him, not even in high school. No, not Mark, design. I mean, it is what I love. It's what I've always wanted to do. And doing Reid's windows, it reminded me of that. And now... Well, your grandma's shoes did say something about stepping into your future. I don't know, I... Allison: Or not. You know what, maybe... maybe you are right. Oh? Okay, so I was running late this morning and I just grabbed the first pair of Christmas shoes that I could find, and it just happened to be these ones. These are the ones that I wore when I blew the deal for the internship, when I listened to what Mark said. Really? Yes, and the note on them, it said, "We hope that people, they see your genius as much as we do." And Mark, he just said "genius." So, I mean, if these shoes are magical, right, what if they're also cursed? Because the last time Mark said "genius", he stole my design. Wait, what if the shoes are trying to correct the past? I mean, Mark sucks, but that is a huge opportunity. I know, I know. I mean, if he's even serious. Well, if he's not, when are you ever gonna get that invitation to throw a drink in your ex's face again? It's so tight! I don't know if this is a good idea. I mean, I haven't skated in a really long time. Well, I promise not to let you fall. You better not, because if you do, I'm just gonna take you down with me. Oh, yeah, you promise? Mm-hm, darn right. Okay, talk is cheap. - Ready? - Yep. - One? - One. Two. Three! Oh! So far, so good. John? Hold on, I'm coming. You have to stand up! Oh... Noelle: Hey! Wow! Hi, how's it going? I thought you said it was just like riding a bike. Uh, yeah, I said that? - Yeah, you did. - Well, then I lied. Like, at this pace, it's gonna take us till next Christmas to get around the rink. - Okay. - Here. Okay, you got some tips? - Mm-hmm. - Here we go. Okay. You're squeezing my hand really tight. - Just breathe, for starters. - Okay. Okay, just kind of try to relax a little bit. Hey, what are you -- - Go! - All right. Noelle: Fly, baby bird, fly! Ahh! I got you, it's all good. Ah, that was really fun. Yeah, so smooth. So, what next? You want to grab a bite? Uh... Actually, I got somewhere to be. Oh, okay. Yeah, just here to get some inspiration for the window, and we did. No, it's not like that. Hey, I'd love to show you the place where I spend most of my free time. - Now? - Yeah, now. Oh! If you're free. Sure, yes! Okay. All right, guys, so for today's theme, we're gonna go with Christmas, and my friend Noelle here has a closet filled with magical Christmas shoes, and she's going to tell you all about them. - I am? - You are. I-I am! Well, um... Every Christmas, my grandmother, she sends me a new pair of shoes and they're always filled with candies, and with them, she writes a message that says at Christmastime, they become magic. Are they really magic? Well, today I wore a pair of ice skates that she gave me for the first time, and I didn't fall, so... Mind you, I also had someone holding my hand and that really helped. Okay, so what you're going to do is you're gonna paint your own version of magical Christmas shoes, and how they make your holiday season special, all right? I'm joining you! Well, that's beautiful. There you go, just let it go. What? Just let it go! Oh, that's beautiful. What inspired this piece? Let's see, my... my grandmother, and of course, my favorite candy. It's a little bit of an homage to this great coach who's even a better art teacher. Someone that keeps surprising me. Well, it's very, very good. Um, may I? Sure. Now, if you just shade it a little more here, that'll give it some definition. Oh, yeah! See? Mr. Reid, clean up on our school floor! Oh! Be right back. Oh, who did this? All right, I got it. You are gonna need some more paint. Want some more green? You want to do it or you want me to help you? Hmm, me. Girl: Smells good! Oh, yeah. You know, it's too bad you couldn't do this all the time. I just, I really think that the world, it would be a better place with your art in it. Well, thank you. I don't disagree. I wish I could do it more at Reid's. You know, I should thank you for giving me the opportunity to infuse a little creativity into corporate sales. Have you, have you ever thought about getting back into design? Um... I mean, that's a... that is a really big risk. Although I do wish it was Christmas all year round. That way, I could always be decorating. Yeah. You know, isn't it funny how as kids, we are taught to follow our dreams, to take big risks. Then, we become adults and the real world just kicks those beliefs right out of us. I know, it's so cruel, right? And those kids today, I just miss that, you know, that gumption. They're just, they're so fearless. Yeah, I know. That's why I love teaching here. You know, kids have a way of showing us how to believe in hope. Mm. Hey, let me show you something. This is my favorite painting. Oh, wow! Yeah, when Billy turned this in, he asked me, "How do Santa's reindeer fly?" Big question. Yeah, I didn't know how to answer, and then, out of nowhere, Georgia pops up and without missing a beat, and she says, "Because they believe they can." - Oh! - Right? She's just... I know, I totally felt that. Yeah, maybe that's all it takes. Belief. John? These are really good. People need to see these. Oh, I love this! I can see why this is your favorite. John: Yeah, it's pretty great. Noelle: They're all great. Here we go. Thank you! What's that, someone checking up on you? No, Allison, she just wants to borrow some Christmas decorations for her party. You... you don't want to go with me, do you? It's just, it's a Christmas party. Christmas party? Eh... One condition, you wear those "Santa Baby" boots. You know, just for inspiration. Noelle: In your dreams. You really do love candy canes. I really do. What's the magic behind those shoes? These ones, the message was, "Christmas brings the sweetest surprises." They were packed with candy canes? Naturally, they were, but not as good as Reid's. I mean, you guys, you really do make the best. Yeah, I know. Hey, we got a minute before we open. Can I show you something? - Yeah. - Okay. Did you know that Reid's was founded on candy canes? Well, it doesn't surprise me, but... Well, it is true. It's a family recipe. - My grandfather -- - Thank you. -- he would hand them out at Christmas to all the kids and the demand became so popular that he founded the store. - Really? - Yes. So, wait a minute, we're -- we're making some? Definitely. You ready? Okay! Here we go, we get the pots. Uh-huh. What kind, traditional? - Yes, please! - All right. Can I get you to pour this? Mm-hmm, okay. Oh, can you pass me a spatula and a whisk, please? Okay. Pop one in. Okay, here we go. And pour. Looks good to me. Okay, give it a good stir. Whisk it up. This is really fun. A little elbow grease, okay? Come on. Thank you! - Ready? - Mm-hmm. Hey, this is a rite of passage in my family. I understand, I feel very honored. Excellent, ready to pour? Okay, cheers. Ahh! Listen to it. That is the sound of Christmas. Grandpa would be proud. All right, we get the gloves. Thank you. Here you go, put these on. Let's see. So, just spread it back and forth like this. Then, squish them together, nice and soft. Gentle, gentle! Okay! They're all so different. Each one is unique because they're handmade. Okay, now we're in the final stage. Okay! This is where we're going to make the crook. I'm a little nervous. Let me see what you got. - Okay, so... - Really gentle. Ah! Just like Bo Peep. My first candy cane! Do I get to keep these? Of course, yeah. That's your payment for the windows. Wow! Seven a.m. and you've already got a huge crowd outside that window, that's impressive. Thanks, thanks, Dad. Um, this is Noelle. She's the one responsible for the crowd and the windows. Nice to meet you. Very nice job, young lady. Thank you! So, what design firm do you work at? Oh, I'm-I'm just a CPA. The design is more of, um, it's more of a hobby for me. Arthur: Oh. Well, I looked at the numbers, and with a week before Christmas, this store is set to outsell the Times Square location. What?! So, it appears you got your Christmas wish, John. I hate to admit it, but you proved me wrong for once. Store's gonna remain open, but I need you to keep up those sales, okay? Yeah, of course, you got it. Lovely to meet you. Uh, you, as well. Yes! Oh! My parents are gonna be thrilled, and you know, if you think about it, technically I would not even be here if it wasn't for your store. You would not. It's all come full circle. Tomorrow at the board meeting, I'm going to pitch your windows and I'm going to propose how a little creativity can really boost sales. The presentation? Yeah, I was going to keep it a secret, but you know what? I want to implement your vision in all of Reid's windows, with you as the head designer. Wow, what? Are you serious? Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I really appreciate your vote of confidence, but... John, come on, Christmas is over in a week, and there'll be no more holiday windows. Yeah, but so what? We've accomplished bigger things with less time. And I was thinking that you could assume a more permanent position beyond Christmas. Um... Oh. Look, I'm just not willing to throw away a whole career for a possibility. I've seen how you light up when you design. You cannot deny how good it feels to do something that you love. You've made me believe in Reid's Candies again, that it's more than a store, that it's a place to bring people together to celebrate the sweeter things in life. Oh, I love this! I love this... so much, but I... I don't know. I... we saved the store. My parents, they fell in love here, and that's why I did all of this, because I wanted to keep a part of their romance alive. Maybe at first, but art is not about obligations, right? It's about your heart. What's your heart say? You really think this is a possibility? I know it's a possibility. Okay, fine, fine! Okay, I'm on board with... I'm on board with the Christmas windows. Hire you? No, okay, it's not for sure yet. He still has to convince his dad and the board. So, it's, I mean, it's a longshot at best. This is huge! Getting out of your safety zone, hard hats off! It is a little crazy, right? Mm-hmm! I mean, these shoes, they're making me take all kinds of risks, and... it's really scary. Noelle, it's great. Just go for what you love. Only if it's the right terms. Allison: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, sure. Do things your way, but this is it. Your shoes stepping into your future with John, and a career? You are literally walking in Christmas magic, will you just embrace it? Okay, it's a little weird! These-these shoes, they came with a note about a sweet Christmas surprise. Can you ask your grandma to add me to her Christmas shoe list? I just, I don't want to get my heart broken again, Allison. You need to learn to love like heartbreak doesn't exist. Maybe you're right. Mark: Hey, ladies! Noelle, oh, I got some big news to share with you. Please, you gotta come with me. Uh, we are working. I swear, all business. Please, just come with me. Oh, please go with him. He won't leave otherwise. True. This better be good. Oh, this is gonna be great. I will be right back. We are looking at our future. Looks pretty bleak. I just signed the ultra high-end shoe boutique Guirlande de Chaussers, and this is their newest location. And together, we will be designing this location and all of their new stores in the tristate area starting in January. Mark, I mean, I... This is huge! This is massive. You see, I told you I would make it up to you. You deserve this, Noelle. Now, come work for me! Uh, with me. Uh... Mark, this is really... this is a lot. This is a lot to process. It is, it is, you're right, you're right. Could you give me an answer before Christmas? I-I can give you an answer before Christmas. Amazing. Nice! I gotta run now, but we will talk very, very soon, okay? Mm-hmm. Yes! John: Wow, Santa baby! I'll be sure to tell Grandma you like them. Please do. Oh, and here are the design schematics, as promised. Thank you, thanks for that. That's great. Should we go? Yeah, yeah, of course, we should. - Great. - Right this way. Oh, wow! So, this is it! Hi! Hey, guys! Oh, wow, those boots look great. Thank you, thank you. It looks amazing in here. Thanks. Um, can I talk to you for a second? Hey, John. Uh, here, can you take that? Help yourself to some drinks. I just need to steal her for one minute. Snacks, anything you want. Noelle: Okay, I'm gonna be right back What are you doing? Allison! Allison, what is going on? Okay, don't freak out. I hate it when you say that. Mark's here. What? What is Mark doing here? Why is he here? I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was in the group text of old high school friends, and then before I realized, it was too late. And I'm sorry! I have not told John about his offer! I mean, do you think that Mark is going to go and talk to him? Mark, pass up an opportunity to brag? Unlikely. Okay, okay. Okay, all we need to do is we just need to, um, we need to keep them apart, okay? We can do that. I'll take John, you take Mark. Yeah, may be too late. This is my fault. What? How? Because these boots! These boots, they're supposed to be conversation starters, and look, they're talking! Right, and now you're a believer, great. That is not helping. Okay, look, I could... I could create a diversion. I could light the tree on fire, maybe? Something? No. Look... obviously, these shoes are trying to say something, right? And I just, I need to be clearer with my intentions. Exactly, yes! Like, like Aladdin and the genie. What? Okay. - Hey! - Hey. Sorry about that. John, I see you met Mark. Well, hello, don't you look beautiful? - Hello. - Nice to see you. So, what are we... what are we talking about? Oh, we're just talking about play-off scenarios. Oh, great! Football, I love... I love football. Mark: Yeah, you know what, John? Here, take one of my cards 'cause you never know when Reid's Candies is looking for a fresh take. And hopefully, I'll be printing some up for you, Noelle. Hmm? You have a chance to decide yet? - Decision? - Yeah, John, come on. You got to convince her to come and work for my new design firm, okay? It's the opportunity of a lifetime! Sounds promising. Exactly, but meanwhile she's got me sweating it while she's thinking about it. We just secured a very, very premium account, and she's undecided. Can you believe it? No, I can't. Yeah, well, you know, I'm not gonna let you be the one to get away twice. I mean, professionally this time. Mark -- I know that we have a past, okay, but it's all water under the bridge. It is, way under the bridge. So, John, can you please convince her to forgive me so that she doesn't pass up this dream job? I'll do my best. Thank you, man. I'm gonna go mingle. Great! Ah, so that's ex-boyfriend Mark? I... did not know that he was going to be here. I did not know that he offered you a job. Honestly, it just happened, and I never know if I can take him seriously. Mark, he's kind of a show-off, and... I didn't know I was going to have competition, especially with your ex-boyfriend. Oh, you don't have any competition. I am committed to you. To, I mean, to Reid's Candies, obviously! John: It's okay. You know what, let's just have fun tonight, all right? Yes, please! John: Come on! I had fun tonight. Yeah, me too. Uh, Mark wants to take me out for a client dinner. He wants to wine and dine me. You're not gonna go, are you? Jealous? I think that he'd be a perfect gentleman on the first date. Mm, he's only after one thing. What's that? Your cheque book. Really? Well, I already have a designer in mind, and the second-best will not do. Oh! Okay, I will call you tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Uh, and hopefully with good news. Right! - Wish me luck. - Good luck. Thanks. - Good night. - Good night. These windows, they've created a social media storm. As a result, this stand-alone store has outperformed our Times Square location. We need to capitalize on this momentum and create a company-wide window display. Let's finish strong this Christmas, and implement a plan for every major holiday next year. All right, shall we vote? All for an immediate Christmas Eve window display? It's settled. Good job. Well done, John. All right, let's hire a design team ASAP. John: I have someone on deck. Noelle Bailey. It was her vision that set off this whole firestorm. Well, I appreciate her vision but a business this size requires a professional team with experience, 'cause we got to have a quick turnaround. Noelle has experience. Leave this to the professionals, son. I'll get our marketing team started on this. Meeting adjourned. John: Dad? Dad! Arthur: Yeah? I want you to let me lead on the windows. It's my project, and I want these designs. Well, it's too late. We hired a professional firm the second the meeting was over. They've already sent over the prototypes. So, what do you think? Come on, look at these. These lack the character that Noelle's windows have. There's no personality. You see any Christmas spirit? Look, I don't know how many times I got to say this to you. The girl is a hometown decorator, and we have got to have a professional team on this. And I'll tell you what, if you want to continue with this window idea, then those are my terms. How do you like that? You're right, Dad. We all need to live by our own terms. Right. Thanks for that. Mr. Reid, marketing needs the approved prototypes for the windows. Um, yeah, they're... the binder's on the table. Hello? Yeah, speaking. How'd it go? Hey, um... They didn't go for it. No, look, I gave it all I could, but it's not happening. That's fine, I... I really appreciate it. But you know what, do not let this make you give up on your dreams. You got to be designing, and, well, even if it's with Mark. Oh, no, I don't -- I don't think that I could ever trust him again. What did you tell me? Go with your gut, right? You're truly an inspiration, you have to. Look, I should be thanking you. Thanking me? It's not official yet, so I can't really say too much, but seeing how you set your goals and the way you didn't compromise on your vision, well, that's true inspiration. That's made me rethink everything. Wow, I can't wait to hear all about it. You'll be the first! Um, so we're on for cocoa tomorrow, right? Absolutely, yes. All right, I'll see you then. Taxi! Oh. Hi, Grandma! You must be out Christmas shopping. Anyways, just thinking about you and sending lots of love. I'll talk to you soon. - Hey! - Don't freak out. I hate it when you say that. What? That is your design, right? The shoes. But-but he said that they passed on it. Well, I guess he used them, anyway. Wow. Oh, and of course, of course these are the shoes that I'm wearing, right? 'Cause these are the shoes I wore when Mark lied to me, and then, stole my designs, and then, broke my heart. And now, John lied to me... stole my designs... This is what I was afraid of, Allison. What are you doing? You know what, these shoes, they're not magic, okay? They're cursed! Don't say that, you love your Christmas shoes! Not anymore! Allison: Noelle! All they've done is cause me heartache and headache, and I'm through with them. Wait, hold on. Okay, you're making me nervous. What are you doing? Take these with you when you go. And do what with it? I don't care, I don't care. You can trash it, you can donate it, I don't care. See you tomorrow. "Every cloud has a silver lining. "My memory of you dancing in my shoes will always brighten my day." Okay, fine. Find me my silver lining. For you, madame. Thank you. Wow, look at those shoes. Are they part of the Christmas collection? Uh, yes, they are. These are the first shoes that my grandmother wore for her first Christmas in America. Hmm. When I was a little girl, I would teeter around in them, and then, when I was of age, she gave them to me. Wow, that's sweet. - Isn't it? - Yeah. Maybe you should build a window around them. Yeah, like, uh... like a silver bells theme. Yeah. So, you gonna take that job offer from Mark? I don't know. You know, fool me once, it's a risk. Yeah, no risk, no reward. Seems to be working for you. I know, I know, right? I can't believe how things turned out. I am so grateful, and I have you to thank for the inspiration. Okay, don't, because gratitude is not going to make this better. Oh, did I do something wrong? Did you really think that I wouldn't find out? But I'm so glad that I'm the source of inspiration for you. Yeah, okay, look, because of you, I finally have a job that I'm excited about. I can finally be creative. Okay, wait... So, that's what all this was about, is you finding your dream job? No, no, of course not. Where are you going? You know, I'm going -- I'm going home. Why? Because I know how this ends. You get the success, and I get a broken heart, and I'm not going to let you ruin my Christmas. So, best wishes with your new life, and you can stay out of mine. Oh! - Oh, hey. - Oh, no! Just let me help you. You know what, don't, okay? You've done enough. Oh, man. Here. Better to be full of wine, than despair. There's not enough wine in the world for that. Plus, you know, we do have to go back to work at some point. It's not like we haven't done it before! So, are you really stepping back into your safety zone? I don't know, I don't know, Allison. It just, it felt so good creating all those windows with John. You know, it changed me. But when my last design career crashed and burned, I vowed to myself that I would never, ever again believe in Christmas magic and in dreams and relationships. But you did, and I'm so glad you did. Being a dreamer suits you. It felt like I was being swept into this... holiday fantasy. You know, after all these years, I was finally stepping into this Christmas dream that my grandma, she believed in so much. And then, reality set in and I woke up, and realized that no, I was just falling back into old patterns. Yeah, well, at least you got some fabulous shoes out of it. That's a silver lining. I guess that's true, if I hadn't asked you to throw a good portion of them out last night. About that... Stupid... What are you doing? No, you didn't! Look, good or bad, they shaped your life. They helped make you into an amazing woman and my best friend. Plus, they're way too spectacular to trash. You... Here is a toast to spectacular shoes, and an amazing friend. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Well, since we're celebrating, um, can I try on those vintage red pumps? Knock yourself out. Yes! Oh, yeah! You know, you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for these shoes. What do you mean? Ah! I mean, your grandparents met because of these shoes. Look at these! Nothing can defy these shoes. They are a confidence-booster, I'll give them that. I feel like I can do anything in these shoes! That's it. What? That is what my grandmother, she's been trying to tell me all these years. It was never about the shoes. Allison, the magic, it's inside of us, and the shoes, they just boost whatever's there already. I like that philosophy much better. Right? But what are you going to do now? Ugh! John was right about this place. This cocoa is delicious. A little help, please? Why did you throw it in the garbage again? Because I was... I was mad and impulsive. How theatrical, I love it. Ah, bingo! Here. Thank you. What's wrong? Oh, no. "The art center's new executive director." Huh... well, that explains things. Huh. This is, this is the surprise that he was talking about. What have I done? Allison, how do I fix this? How do I fix this? Well, what does your heart tell you to do? I think my heart wants John. And I can't let him go like this, and I just... I need to step it up. Mm-hmm. Okay, I think I know what to do, but I'm gonna need your help. Of course! Okay. Okay, I talked to the store manager and he agreed to let us have the show there. How did you convince him to do it so early? I may have told him that corporate asked me to throw a going-away party for John. Noelle, you lied? It's Christmas! Well, I think all this Christmas spirit is giving me the confidence to lie like the Dickens. Well, confidence is everything. It's on, Operation Save Your Man! Yeah. Hey, I-I came as soon as you texted. Oh! They told me to wait here, so... Of course. Here I am. Right, I'll... I'll give you your privacy. I have a feeling this isn't going to be a Merry Christmas for me. You know that I can't take your offer, not after everything that's happened. Yeah, well, I had to try. I do appreciate your offer, I do. I just don't want you to hate me, you know? Look, I made some mistakes, and I... I just never wanted to hurt you, I hope you know that. Things happened, and I just wasn't clever enough to change the course. I don't hate you. I mean, how could I? That whole situation, it taught me a lot of lessons. You deserve the best, Noelle. Thank you. I expect big things from you. Me too. Me too. How did you get all of these paintings here without him knowing? Well, I talked to the parent advisory board, and they agreed to have them delivered. Ahem! Hi there, sorry to interrupt. I'm just looking for Mr. Reid? Do you have an appointment? Uh, no, I don't. Oh, it's Christmas Eve, and I know he wants to leave early. We could set something up for after the holidays. Yeah, that's-that's not gonna work. Mr. Reid! It's Noelle, right? Yes, good to see you. Yeah, well, if you're looking for John, he doesn't work here anymore. I'm... I am aware of that. Um, I'm actually here to talk to you. You know, people, they wake up every day wanting to change their lives, to live their passion, and most people, they don't follow through with that, but John, John, he did, and I really think that you should be proud of him. That's a hobby. This? This is a legacy. And with all due respect, sir, what he is leaving for those children, that is going to be John's legacy. I... Did you know that my parents, they got engaged at your store, and it changed their lives. It changed my life, don't you see? And what John is doing for those children, it's changing their lives. I mean, it would be so easy for John just to be safe and easy here, but he's not because... because it's not what makes him truly happy. And at the end of the day, isn't that what's important? What makes us happy? I think that you should let him be that incredible artist and teacher that he is. And if you, if you still have doubts, maybe this will change your mind. Merry Christmas, Mr. Reid. Okay, I don't want to be greedy, but if there's any magic left in you, please, please, please, please give me my wish, okay? Hi! Merry Christmas! This is such a great turn-out. Everyone loves your window display. Oh, thank you. Hey, it's gonna be okay. It's Christmas, everything will be just fine. I just, I really think that I blew it. What? Do you see these kids? This is their best Christmas ever. Um, he's here. Well, go to him! Oh! - Hi. - Hi. - You came. - Of course. I got your invitation, and I can't say no to the kids. And besides, it's part of my new job. Look, John, I didn't know. I saw Reid's using my ideas without me, and I... I just jumped to conclusions. There's no way that I'd steal your ideas. That's-that's not who I am. I know that, I do, and I... and I knew it then, but I just... I got stuck in the past, and the fear, and... I'm so sorry. It's okay. I understand. You do? Yeah, and I did a little digging too. I found out that an assistant sent your ideas to marketing. It was just a complete mix-up. So, before I leave, I will make sure you're fairly compensated. Oh, I mean, that's not why... I'm doing all this. Why did you do this? I did it for you. I mean, I honestly didn't... I didn't know if you were going to talk to me again, and I needed you to know how much you inspire me. And... how you've restored my faith in magic. How did I do that? Well, for starters, you showed up. And that made me believe that all is not lost. It's not. Hi, Mr. Reid! Oh. We should probably go in. Yes, yes, we should. Hey, everybody, look who's here! Georgia: Mr. Reid's here! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Um, let me take your jacket. This is amazing. Thank you! Are those the shoes that started it all? Yes, my grandmother, she took her first steps into her new life in these. And maybe I can, too. Is there anything I can help with? - Uh, Mr. Reid. - Dad. This is... it's maybe better than I expected. Yeah, probably record sales. That's not what I meant. I meant the kids, and... and the art. Son, I am so sorry for the way I spoke to you. I just want you to know that I am so proud of you. You're living your dream, and you're happy. And that's all that really matters, right? And you, young lady, my son was right about you. Why don't you come and work for me? Head designer at all Reid's locations. What? All... - Really? - Wow. Um... I think I'm ready to step into my future. Thank you so much, Mr. Reid. I love you, Son. I love you too, Dad. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! You got Santa Claus, on Christmas Eve? Hey, anything's possible. All you have to do is believe. Okay, come with me. What? It's kind of corny, but... Merry Christmas. Is that okay? Yeah, this just makes me really, really happy, because it reminds me that romance is still very much alive and well. Especially at Christmas.
