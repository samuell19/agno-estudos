(slow music plays) - [Tucker] What's that smell? - The smell? I don't smell anything. - [Person Off-Camera] You're not smoking out there again, are you? - Who me? - Brush fires, Nat. You ever hear of them? - It just rained. God, if it isn't one thing, it's another. - And how about the wrath of God if you don't put out the damned cigarette? And please no, don't keep putting them out in the begonia. - Aren't we just the embodiment of mirth this morning? - Sorry. The damned thing, it just won't listen. - Here, let me. What's this? James Joseph Tucker, you nervous? Come on, say it ain't so, Joe. - I'm human, aren't I? Besides, I like it when you help me. - See what do I get in return? Don't worry, Tucker. You'll get the Humphrey account and then Slater and McBride will hand you your VP stripes on a silver platter. And before you know it, you'll be buying the company. Madison Avenue will bow before you, commodities brokers will hush when you speak. - Hush. - And in time, you may even run for public office. It's all in advertising anyway. - Well it sounds good. That crystal ball? - Don't need a crystal ball. It's as plain as the nose on your face. So blatantly patrician, you're the kind of guy that always gets what he wants. - You sure about that? - I'm sure. - So that must mean if I ask you to move in with me, you will? Hmm, why not? - Because I have an apartment. - But you're never there. - It's mine nonetheless. - Not if you don't make next month's rent. - Thanks. - Natalie. You know how beautiful you are? - You're nuts, you know that? - Too beautiful. I'd like to make up. I'd like to make peace. Come on. - You know I like you asking. (romantic music plays) - What are you doing? We don't have time for this, you know we got, we got work to do, we got to, we got a lot of work, we gotta get to work, we gotta. (upbeat music plays) (Natalie moans) (Natalie groans) (elevator doors ring) - Bet I can make you hard before we reach eight. - No touching. - No touching, five bucks. - You're on. Oh. - Miss Baker. - Good morning, Mr. Garson. - Flat tire? Power outage turned your alarm clock off? No wait, dog ate your report and you had to do it all over again. Or is it that night school isn't something you can't handle and still show up to work on time? - Oh no sir, that's not it at all. I have the reports right here. There you go, Huggable Huggles, West Coast inventory and shipping reports. Reformatted and indexed. - The job comes first, Natalie, it's paying for that MBA of yours. - Of course it is, sir. - How long have you been doing support on the Huggles account? - Six months. Sir. - [Daniel Garson] Know it pretty well then I suppose? - Yes, yes I do, sir. - I hope Young Stevens has been giving you the help you needed compiling the information. I wanna know if he's been slacking off. - Stevens? Oh no sir. He's been very helpful. - Good, good. - Mr. Garson. - Hmm? - I understand that you have a position opening up later this month and. - Ah. Jim, my boy, right on time. Looks pretty hefty, whatever you've got in there. - Well it's an idea or two. Dad always taught me to come prepared. - How is the old man? It's been ages. - He's, He's fine. - Good. - Actually he's fine, sends his regards. - Mm, well good. Well let's use the conference room then, give you some more room, and give me five minutes and I'll meet you there. - Are you crazy? He's right there. - You earned it. - Good luck. Oh goodie, a gas money. (car engine roars) - I guess I'm not making it to class tonight, am I? - I wouldn't know about that, ma'am. - Are we getting out of the truck? - Oh yeah, sure. Mike, get this thing down. What are you doing, sitting there? Come on. Okay, you can wait in the back over there, it's gonna take a few minutes, thanks. - Here, why don't you use mine? - Denise. - Natalie. Well fuck me silly, I thought it was you. - Hi. - How are you doing? So, I wanna hear more, this guy Tucker, well he sounds like a damned saint to me. - I'll tell him you said that. - Not too saintly I hope. Saints weren't known for a good marathon fuck. - Denise. Just like old times. So tell me about you, you haven't told me a thing. The last thing I remember, you cursed out our high school ballet teacher for correcting your posture. - Oh yeah, right, Miss Coolidge. She was quite the cunt, wasn't she? - Denise. - What? They didn't teach you that word in college. It means. - I know what it means. Thank you. - Well in any case, old hag must have had some effect on me 'cause I'm still dancing. - You are? What kind of dance? Are you with the company? - Oh yeah, it's the company alright. Did you ever hear the Hollywood Glitter Dome? - Oh, very funny. Come on. What company? - Well it's not like I suck guys off for a living, for Christ's sake, I mean that's where they go after I'm through with them. - Another fucking massive piece of shit. Well, fucking. - So what's the scoop? - What's the scoop? This is gonna run you 2000, maybe 2,500. - $2,500 for what? - Well that's what it costs to replace an engine, ma'am. You threw a rod, there's nothing I could do. Be honest with you, this car ain't worth fixing. The blue books, maybe half of what the repairs will run you. - So what are you saying? - Oh, what I'm saying. Tell you what, I know this guy, he'll give you a $300, maybe 350 for the car. - Thanks for the bedside manner, Sparky. - Denise, please. - Well, jeez, sorry I was taking your side. Hey look at this as a sign. A new car does wonders for the spirits and I know a guy who'll give you a great deal. - I can barely afford rent. Do you have any idea how much it costs for graduate school these days? - No, can't say that I do. I missed the exit to college, you know what I mean? - You know what the worst thing is? Tucker is gonna insist on paying for this. - So what's so bad about that? - I don't know, maybe I'm a fool, I just like earning my way, that's all. - Well, glad to hear it. Now you're speaking my language. (car horn sounds) Well, here's my bucket of bolts. Sorry. Look, let me ask you a question, how much to get yourself outta hock, you know, back on your feet? Car repair, what, you're gonna dry clean it for, the whole kit and caboodle? - I don't know, like four or five grand, why? - Honey, that's a month's salary for me. A slow month. And with the way you look, shit, I don't have to tell you, it's perfect timing, really. One of our dancers just quit, come down tonight, you missed your class anyway, right? Check the place out. You can see how I've improved since high school ballet. - You're serious? - Of course I am, what have you got to lose? - Well, I can't tonight. Tucker and I are supposed to celebrate and his meeting went really well and - Oh, I get it. - Christ, I forgot to call him. - You think I'm trash, don't you? - No, Denise. - Okay, what is it you want to do here? - Yeah, fix it. - Fix it? - You heard the lady, fix it? Looks like Mr. Tucker's paying. He's a saint, you know? - Yeah, okay, sure (indistinct). - I'm a stripper, Natalie, that's what I do. Paid for my car, paid for my tits, paid for my divorce. I can't complain. I'm not embarrassed. Oh, it's been lovely. - Wait, Denise, why don't we go out another night, okay? - I work at night. - Well then lunch, then. - I sleep at lunch. Look, thanks for gracing me with your company and all. If you wanna see me, you know where you can find me. - Okay, just gonna need your signature right here, okay. Okay, thank you. You know your friend looks so familiar to me. I wish I could remember where I could place her. - She's dressed, maybe that threw you. Please tell me you have a loaner for me, Larry? Just please tell me that. - Gal, we got this one for you over here, Okay? - I see, moving up in the world. Tucker, where are you? (whistles) Come on, the champagne's getting warm. I hope you don't mind the vintage honey. It's the best $5 bottle I could get. Tucker. - [Voice Answering Machine] Natalie, I'm really sorry about our little celebration, it's gonna have to wait, you know the meeting went so well today the top brass of the office decided we shouldn't drop the ball. Anyway, um, there's a charity function that Garson's wife is throwing at the Beverly Concord. I know, I know, it's all that boring, overpriced champagne and glitter and crap and who needs it, right? All I gotta say is if this thing goes down, like I think it's going to, we're gonna be set. And if you still don't want to move in, I got a great idea, I'll buy that apartment building, I'll give you one heck of a rent reduction, so what do you think? How's that for a compromise? Alright, I gotta go. I love you baby, bye. (upbeat music plays) (patrons cheer) - [Patron] Have you ever been with another woman? - What was that? I can't quite hear you. - I asked if you've ever been with another woman. - Hmm. Naughty, naughty, and wouldn't you like that? - It's not me who's interesting? - It's my good friend, Andrew. - Is Mr. Jackson have a habit of sticking his nose in places it doesn't belong? - He does have a penchant for a certain (indistinct), yeah. And so does his good buddy, Ulysses. - The guys wouldn't have a pal by the name of Ben, would they? - Maybe, Mr. Franklin prefers a direct answer to a direct question. - Well, tell Mr. Franklin that when it comes to personal preference, I share his friend's choice of aroma. - Can you be a little bit more specific? - Pussy, there is no substitute. Does Mr. Franklin have any close relatives that would like to know more of my intimate details? - As a matter of fact, the Franklins are having a little family reunion tomorrow night. They were helping for a little private demonstration of your personal preferences. - How big a family? - 20 strong. 2000 to be split between both performers, of course. - Oh, of course. Is the Franklin family willing to give me the cash in advance? - Can be arranged. - I'll have to make a call, come back in an hour with cash. - More champagne, Mr. Garson, don't mind if I do, Jim, my boy, don't mind if I do. (slow music plays) I tell you, Jimbo, me and your old man used to drink this stuff like water in the old days. How is the old bugger, anyways? Maybe we could all go play some golf sometime or maybe go shoot a moose or two. (Natalie screams) I am terribly sorry gentlemen, but this party's beginning to be a bit of a bore. No, no, no, no, no. Don't get up. My limo is waiting right outside. How much for the orchestra seats? - Huh? - Tickets. - Hey babe, no charge, chicks get in free. - How noble. (club music plays) What the hell am I doing in here? - What can I get you, darling? What's the strongest drink you got? - Specialty of the house. I call it a Glitter Bomb. - What are they doing over there? - [Bartender] That's called lap dancing, honey. - Oh, another specialty of the house. - We didn't invent it, if that's what you mean. - Look out, this stuff makes men spin, I don't know what it does to women. - [Announcer] Put your hands together for Cassandra. (patrons cheer) And now let's have a big Glitter Dome welcome for Ophelia. - All right, Natalie. Now you've seen enough, now you can go home. - Something special for the lady? - Denise. I just came by to see what you do to earn five grand a month. - Is that what you're here for, hon, a lesson? - No, that's not it at all. Denise, Denise. - Now the rules are you can't touch back no matter how much you want to, understand? - Denise. - The name's Veronica. now here's lesson number one. - Denise. - [Patron] Whoo, babe, shake that (indistinct). - You have to stand so close to the customer? - Any further away and it wouldn't be a lap dance, now, would it? - Denise, come on. - Now, (indistinct) goes something like this. - Denise, come on. Denise. - [Patron] You got it, baby. - Well fellas, wanna see more? - [Patron] Here we go. - Let's be fair to my helpless assistant now, fellas. Here's something nice to finish with. It's kind like the bow you used to take in ballet class, only backwards. - [Natalie] Come on, Denise, stop it. - What do you think Miss Coolidge would say of my posture now? - Tell you to straighten those legs. - Lesson over. - Yeah, remind me to give a few pointers on macroeconomics. Takes a little more aptitude then just sticking your ass into someone's face. - This is the only economics I know or need to know. But you don't need this, do you? - When all else fails it's your saintly rich boyfriend will pay those bills for you won't he? Here take it, you've earned it. - Lorraine, give me a Glitter Bomb. - Do we get to see any more of you? - It all depends upon how much you got. - Who's the Audrey Hepburn number then? (Denise scoffs) - Nobody, Max, she's nobody. - Really? - Excuse me, I got customers. - Don't let me interrupt. (Denise laughs) - Could you help me undo my zipper, sir? - You made it back already. - Good choice. - What do you mean? - She's the one, right? - Ah-ah-ah. That's all you got? This is all you get. - You wouldn't want her, she's just a beginner. - She looked like a quick learner to me. - Take my word for it. What you need is a professional and Ophelia is the one for the job. - All right, 12:00 midnight, tomorrow night. You know the address, don't be late, okay? This is your first time, you'll wanna make a good impression. - Bring up the blue hatchback, 582. - What are you looking at? - They're looking at you, of course. And they'll pay to look at you, if you wish. - I don't wish, and I get paid to think. What are you doing? Tucker? - Natalie, I don't want any arguments, okay? You can call the (indistinct). - Come on, No. - (indistinct) interest is. - Tucker. - Sh-sh-sh. Hey, hey, just tell me how much did the guy say it was gonna be and I'll stop. - Come on, if you'd shut up. - Natalie. - I'd tell you the good news. - What? What are you talking about? Tell me about it. - I got a promotion. - Well that is great. Tell me about it, what's, what's going on? - I mean, first he starts off with how he, you know, wished he had more people like me and how impressed he is that I'm going for my MBA and would I like to manage the Huggable Huggles line. - Congratulations. That's awesome. Why didn't you tell me this first? - You didn't give me a chance. - Hey, come on, what's wrong? - Nothing. - What's going on? - Nothing, I'm happy. I'm happy that you're getting your account and that I'm moving up. Just happy. See? Happy, happy, happy. I feel that I deserve this promotion. I do. I feel that I deserve this promotion and that I approved my loyalty to the company, and Mr. Garson, I feel like I proved my work to the company. Is he busy? (off-camera laughter) - That's very funny. - Oh, Natalie, just the girl I wanted to see. I'd like you to be the first to welcome our newest junior executive into the fold. I wanted you to know how seriously I weigh your opinions, and I've made Stevens here well aware that it was your stellar recommendation that clinched my decision for me. So, I'd say he owes you a great deal of gratitude, right, Stevens? - Oh, absolutely, absolutely, thank you very much for your support, Ms. Baker. Thank you very much. - Natalie? - Oh, yes sir, of course, I'm glad I could be of help. Congratulations, Michael. - Thanks. I hope you know that this, this doesn't change a thing, you're still the point person on the Huggles account as far as I'm concerned, and I don't think of us as anything less than equal colleagues. We work together on that. - Natalie? Natalie, what are you doing? - Checking my breasts. - Oh, they're still there. Natalie, are you all right? - I couldn't be better. I'm going to have to shave. - What? - The king line, nice and neat, I think it's a requirement. - Natalie, honey, they'll be other promotions, I mean, we all just have to. - Wait? Is that what you're gonna say? Like you? Should I learn from your years of experience on the fucking bench? - Think whatever you want. The time will come. - When, Helen, when? Why don't you let me know and I can write it down on my Filofax. (club music plays) - Where have you been? - Sorry, sorry, I'll be quick. - [Denise] What's your fucking problem? - Don't get your panties all wet. Plenty of time for that later. Had a bachelor party went late, all right? The yuppie bastards wouldn't let me go until I did the lollipop gag for the best man. - You got 10 minutes. We lose this job, and I'll rip your tits off with my bare claws. - Promises, promises. - Move your ass, Susan. - It's Ophelia, all right? Like in Shakespeare? Hamlet and Juliet? - Nine minutes, I'll be in the parking lot. (rhythmic music plays) - Who's your decorator, honey. Down and dirty, huh? But that's the way we like it. - All right, here's the program, please. I want you both fully closed until Mr. Franklin has entered and taken a seat. - Where's he gonna sit? - I'm sure that doesn't matter, Ophelia. - He wants a good view, don't he? - He's gonna sit behind the desk. - Do you think we could have a drink or something before we go into this thing cold, like, shot of vodka or something? - Does this look like a cocktail lounge to you? Now, once he's taken a seat, he'll shuffle some papers, that's your cue, start removing your clothes, he prefers it if you remove each other's clothes, is that understood? - Why would he want us to do that? - Oh, jeez, alright. - We know the program. - Now continue with your love making until he's left the room. And please don't try faking anything. He likes these intimacies to be real. Any questions? Good. (elevator whirs) (rhythmic music plays) (door closes shut) (Ophelia moans) (Ophelia and Denise moan) (paper rips) (door slams) - Jesus, did you get the feeling that guy was writing a review or what? Well, I hope it was a good review. That sure was an easy 500. You know how many lollipops I have to? - Don't discuss the money with the clients around. - Oh, excuse me. (slow music plays) - [Tucker] Hey, Natalie. - Will you gimme a break please? - [Tucker] Hey, what with you? - Can I just have one cigarette in peace? - [Tucker] That's not what I was gonna say. What I was gonna say is what do you think about Mexico over the 4th of July weekend? Kind of a celebration trip, huh? Hey, you can even pay your own way if you like, as a matter of fact, I insist to pay your own way, how's that? - Just great. - [Tucker] What? - I said it sounds great. - [Max] Oh yes. - I don't know, I don't think this is such a good idea. - You don't mind if I disagree with you, do you? - Look, I have to be back. I only have an hour for lunch, so. - Well, I'll tell you what a good idea it is, good enough that I think a little advance is in order. What'd you say, Lorraine? - Money in the bank. - She should know, Lorraine was a dancer once, the best. Now, she's my partner. - Few days in Denise's hands and she'll get the hang of it. - Could you teach me? - That's fine by me. How about it Lorraine? - Sure, why not? (slow guitar music plays) - Got a man in your life? - Yes. - Good, all you gotta do is think of him. - What, now? - Mm-hmm, no time like the present. You can't do Max, You can't do anybody. (Max laughs) Just follow me. Watch your hands. Truth is, sweetheart, you're in charge. Once you remember that, the rest is cake. - Can't believe it. The library again? (romantic music plays) - I know baby, I know it's a pain, but I'd be stupid not to take advantage of it. I mean it stays open till three in the morning for a month prior to exams. And there's like about a dozen reference books and I have to go through them. - Mm-hmm. - And I can't check out. - Yeah, yeah, I understand, every night, every night. - It's just for a month until exams are over. It's important to me. - I know, I know, I know, I know, but you know, I. - Will you bear with me? - Can I come visit? - Not if you don't want me to be distracted and fail. You know that I love you, don't you? - I know you do. I just wish you weren't so damn driven. So, what was all this? It was a goodbye dinner? - I'm not leaving town, I'm just gonna go study and I'll be back later to curl up, is that all right? - When do we get to make love? - Join me in the mornings, I might surprise you. (upbeat music plays) - Check that out. - Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your evening, sir. - Where are you going? The night is still young. I've come prepared this time. - Mm. It's time for my break. I'll be back in 30 minutes, so don't go anywhere. (Natalie clicks her tongue) I'll come back later. - You do that. - You're just jealous 'cause my breasts are real. - Get the fuck outta here. - Ooo. - What do you want me to do, exactly? - Simple, get rid of her. - Get rid of her? Denise, she's been with us a week, already I'm counting 20 repeat customers coming in here just for her. "When's Audrey start, Max?" "Is she on every night, Max?" She's a natural. - What am I? - You are a professional. - If you had to choose her or me? - Denise, you are one of my best dancers. - The best dancer. - And I know how smart you are. So I hope you won't ask me to make that decision. Sweetheart, why don't we ask Gary to close up tonight, I'm beat. - Oh, you getting old on me, Max? - Maybe. (birds chirping) (sheets rustling) - [Natalie] Don't move. Stay. - Mm-hmm. (slow guitar music plays) (upbeat guitar music plays) (Natalie groans) - Natalie. If this is what a promotion to product manager does to you, why don't you give me some warning so I can make out my will before you become vice president. - Come on, Natalie, come on. You gotta go. - Just five more minutes, honey. - We gotta go, we gotta get up. - Oh my God, my head hurts. Will you go in my purse and get me my aspirin? Forget it, all right, forget it. Forget it, forget it. Go on. I'll go get in the shower. No. - [Person Off-Camera] Natalie. - It was the Huggable Huggles line? - [Person Off-Camera] Natalie, do you hear me? - No, it wasn't. - Natalie, do you, get off the phone, Natalie. Natalie, get off the phone, Natalie. - Hold on. - Natalie, get off the phone. - Sir, right, of course I know what the capacity is, it. - 18 gross, individually packaged, or 25 gross in bundles of point of purchase display. - Sir, but I cannot answer that question until you specify their discrepancy on the inventory received. Are they talking packaged or POP bundles? Point of purchase displays. Well, of course there's a difference. They should know that. No, sir, there's no problem. Absolutely. Stevens, Michael Stevens. Yes, sir. When I call you into my office, I expect you to get off your ass and get in there. And if you think that little game you were playing was cute. - Oh, whatever happened to the little colleague speech, work for and with? - You, like your job, Natalie. - It's Ms. Baker. And no, I hate my job, but I do my job, which is more than I can say for you. So look kid, understand one thing. If you think that I'm gonna save your ass every time you realize how little you know about your account, you're sadly mistaken. If you don't like it, fire me. Just remember one thing, you're on your own. You got your promotion now, earn it. (Natalie chuckles) (club music plays) - [Lorraine] Natalie, honey, I need you on stage next. - Lorraine, hang on, I just started my break five minutes ago. It can't be my turn on rotation yet. - It is since Cinnamon twisted her ankle and all the other girls are out on the floor. - But Lorraine. - But Natalie, besides a bunch of Japanese suits just walked in. You do a good job up there, I guarantee you big bucks, babe. - All right, how long do I have? - Mm, two, maybe three minutes. - Jesus, okay. - [Patron] Whoo. - Oh, I remember you, the one with all the famous friends. I haven't heard from you. Wasn't the other evening's performance satisfactory? - As a matter of fact, I'm here at Mr. Franklin's behest to arrange for an encore performance. - Oh, well, Ophelia and I are always willing to accommodate. - I'll be frank, your presence is always welcome of course, but Ophelia on the other hand, leaves a little something to be desired. - Perhaps you're looking for someone a little more limber. - As a matter of fact, I was hoping for something a little bit more refined. - [Announcer] Well, gents, ready for more? Then would you welcome to the main stage the lovely, the luminous, Audrey. (jazzy music plays) - Like her, perhaps. If you'll pardon me, I'd like to watch the show. (patrons cheer) - (laughs) Money in the bank. - What did I tell you, Max. (upbeat music plays) ♪ Come on, let's go now ♪ ♪ Come on, let's go now ♪ ♪ You can do everything you want me to ♪ ♪ Do ♪ ♪ To you ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby, come on ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, come on out ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby, come on ♪ ♪ Come on down to the Go-Go lounge ♪ ♪ Go now, go now ♪ ♪ Go now, go now ♪ ♪ Go now, go now ♪ (patrons cheer) - She's the one I want. - Come on, honey, let's see what you got. - Stevens, please. (Stevens laughs) - You sure you want her? - Let me put it to you this way, if you can't get her, I'll be forced to look somewhere else. - Well, if it's Audrey you want, Audrey you'll get, but it's gonna cost you. - 2,500 is acceptable. How's Friday night? - Friday? No problem. - Take the service elevator, gonna be the same agenda at the same time. (Tucker sighs) - [Tucker] So how was the library? - Tucker. Let me, let me explain. - You know, first came dinner, and Garson introduces me to some idiot named Stevens new executive in charge of the Huggles account? - I didn't wanna lie. - Oh, but I think you did. I think you lied real fucking big. - Look, it's real simple, okay? I didn't like you buying me out of trouble every time something went wrong. - Pride? Oh my God, is that what this is all about? It's all about pride? - Call it what you like. - Are you proud of what you're doing? - Proud? - Yes, are you proud of what you're doing? - No, but I'm not ashamed either. I was doing what I had to do. - Oh, okay, I see. You won't take money from the man who loves you, and yet you will by getting naked in front of strangers and letting slime bags drool all over you. - Slime bags. - Yeah, slime bags. - Weren't you there tonight? - Oh Christ, Natalie. - [Natalie] Huh? - You think I wanted to be over there? Huh? - All those Japanese guys, Hashimura executives. That's Garson's parent company. Do you understand what I'm saying here? I have to sell them on the advertising campaign before Slater McBride gets the account. No account, no VP stripes, it's not like I wanted to go. - Oh, so as long as it's for your good fortune, then you'll just grin and bear it, right? - It's different. - How? We both went to the Glitter Dome to earn money tonight, didn't we? And that is my point. I earned that money, Tucker. Me. And that son of a bitch Stevens took my job. But you know what? He was in the palm of my hand. He was in the palm of my hand. It's just for a while anyway. Just, I said a month and I meant a month. Just until I get on my feet again. But they have to be my feet and not yours. - Oh God. - You understand? - No. - What do you wanna do? Do you wanna make war or do you wanna make peace? Please, Tucker, make peace. I love you. (Tucker chuckles) What do you want me to do to prove it to you? - You're good. You're real good. All right, here, here's five bucks. What can that get me? - Insubordination toward an account supervisor such as Stevens is inexcusable, Ms. Baker. - Oh, please, spare me, all right? Don't tell me you're doing this because of what I said to Stevens the other day, is it? At least you could do. - All right. This is a toy company. Toys, Ms. Baker, for children, is that quite clear? You've left me no choice. - What choice did you leave me? - I'm not sure I understand. - You won't let me earn the living that I deserve, but you'll wax moral when I have to do what I have to to survive. - By what I saw on that stage, Ms. Baker, you'll do more than survive and you won't have this job to hinder your progress. You may pick up your severance check today, I've already alerted accounting. (Natalie exhales) (slow music plays) - Natalie, I'm sorry. It's really not fair. - You don't wanna be seen talking to me. You want that promotion one day, don't you? (Stevens clears throat) Coming to gloat? - Gloat? No, I came to apologize. I wanted to say how sorry I was for the way that I acted and about the way that things turned out. I don't think it was right what he did. I mean, why would I want you fired? You said it yourself, I barely know the account. - You'll do just fine. - As will you, I'm sure. I mean, you'll land on your feet, you're too good not to. - Thank you. Maybe I can call you for a recommendation. - Sure, you should call anytime. Maybe I can call you too. You know, talk things over, get to know each other a little better. Who knows, honey, maybe we can work something out. Hey Jimbo, didn't I tell you she works here? Well worked here anyway, the old man just gave her the heave-ho. - Hmm, that so. - Yeah, it's too bad, I wouldn't have minded her staying, you know what I mean? - Uh, no, no, I don't actually know, what do you mean? - You saw her. I mean, what would you give to see that luscious ass bent to. (punch rings out) - What the fuck is, motherfucker, what the fuck? (Stevens grunts) - Jim. What on Earth are you doing? Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, slight misunderstanding, come right this way. No problem, thank you, thank you. I'm so glad that you came (indistinct). (pensive music plays) - You okay? Hey, wait a minute. Truce, Okay? - Truce? What the hell for? Like, I liked the way our relationship is going, fucked? So, fuck off. - I thought maybe we could patch things up. - Just like that? That easy? - No, not easy. If you think this is easy for me, you're outta your fucking mind. Look, um, this, all of it, it turned out all wrong, okay? I mean, I was the one who asked you to come here in the first place. We were friends. - Oh, you're breaking my heart. What do you want? (slow music plays) - Look, if you don't wanna be lovey-dovey, I understand, I even deserve it, but here we are working in the same fucking place, so how about just civil? We can be civil to each other, can't we? Look, maybe I got jealous, okay? I mean, here you are fresh off the boat and already the guys are like, Audrey this and Audrey that and, and when you're on the stage, it's like, I don't get that. Never did, maybe Miss Coolidge was right, bad posture. - Well, miss Coolidge never had to take her clothes off for a living. What does she know anyway? Do you think the guys really like me? - Maybe it's those real breasts of yours. People like to stare at freaks. Look, I don't have a lot of experience apologizing. - Oh. I do hate coming in here every time and having to leave, it's a pain in the ass. - So now that we're all chums and everything, if you don't mind me saying so, but you don't look so good. You been drinking or crying? Crying, huh? Maybe you should be drinking instead. Same effect, but getting there is a lot more fun. What's the matter? - Nothing. I just lost my job and my man in the span of 24 hours. - What happened? - It's a long story. It's long, sad and boring. Let's say we not talk about it. - Whatever you want, you'll be all right though. - You think? - Start with a Glitter Bomb and go from there. - You buying? - Yeah. (drink pours) - Thinking of falling off the stage tonight? - It's just a couple of drinks, Lorraine. Natalie has had a bad day, her guy dumped her and she lost her job. She needs it. - Since when did you two become drinking buddies? - Since she apologized, okay? I can forgive and forget. Stranger things have happened. - Yeah, well, not too many, all right? We open in an hour. - Loves me not. She loves me. She loves me not. This is fucking ridiculous. Yeah, I need the number to the Hollywood Glitter Dome. - You are really beautiful, what is your name? - Audrey. - Oh, that's not your name, come on. What's your real name? - Audrey. - Hey. Hey. - Hey yourself. - Max and Lorraine think you're drunk. - I'm not that drunk. - Trust me, on this one, honey. Max has fired girls for less. It's time for your break, isn't it? - Yes. - Go in the backstage and I'll give you some coffee. - Okay. - Lorraine, gimme a coffee, I think Natalie's had one too many. - God damn it, Denise, what the hell did I tell you? - Well, I had just as much as her, you don't see me tripping all over myself, do you? (suspenseful music plays) Here we are. Hot and black. - Thank you. - Are you kidding? This is all my fault. If anything happens, I'll never forgive myself. Come on, drink up. (indistinct) (muffled thud) - [Max] What's the matter with her? - [Lorraine] Glitter Bomb explosion. - So sorry. Please don't fire me. I didn't think I was this drunk. - It's okay, honey. All you need to do is sleep it off? Nice, warm bed. I'm off anyway, I'll take her home. I'll have Juan drive her. - Please, I feel horrible. She needs to be with a friend right now, not Juan, the valet. She'll be all right. - Come on, Max. Go ahead and let her take her home. - Okay. - Juan, gimme a hand, open the door, open the other door. - [Tucker] Natalie. Natalie. (tires screech) Natalie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Natalie. (upbeat rhythmic music plays) - Here we are. I got you, don't worry. You're gonna be okay. Here, lie down. (indistinct) (slow foreboding music plays) (paper rustles) I bet you feel just like a little girl. And just relax and let Mommy take care of you. - Well, (indistinct) (indistinct) (stranger giggles) - What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. - Denise? - (indistinct) - [Natalie] Get off. Please, stop. Get off me. - Natalie. - Tucker. Tucker. (stranger gasps) (slow, pensive music plays) Mm. - Hey, you're home. You're all right. - Saving me again, Tucker. - [Tucker] Shh. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't get there earlier. Okay? I should have. - What's the big idea? Big boys with perfect noses don't cry. I'm fine. I'm all right. You should be out conquering the world. - The world's gonna have to wait. I haven't quite got an office to go to yet. - I missed you. - An early Christmas gift. - Thank you. That was Garson. The man in the room? It was Garson. - What? - I saw him, I did. - I mean are are you sure, are you positive? I mean, you weren't imagining it because you were pretty well drugged up at the time. - It was Garson. Do you still want your account? - No. - One call's all that take. - No, I, blackmail, it's not my gig. There's such a thing as pride, you know? You know, um, I will take a loan if that's possible, I mean, rent's due and I'm a little bit short. Is that gonna be okay? - Well, I figure since I'll be living here, I might as well have to pay my way. - You mean? - Mm-hmm. - Cool. (upbeat guitar music plays) - You cannot go in there. - Excuse me. - That's all you want, a good recommendation? - An honest recommendation will do just fine. But no, that's not all. - Ms. Simpson, please ask Mr. Stevens to come to my office. Immediately. - Hi Helen. - Hi, what are you doing here? - Hi, Mikey. You're right, Helen, your time has finally come.
