This story shouldn't have ended this way. At least, I never imagined that my story would end this way. VIP room five. This is life. She's like a ripe peach. She's got mad booty. Shall we? I'm a vegetarian. Man, I really love these singles' parties. I'm like a kid in a candy store. Who will take me home? Take your pick. After tonight, whatever I drink won't have that bachelor's taste. How do you feel about it? Marching off to the end of my life as a single man. Ma Liang, colleagues. The star of tonight's bachelor party is getting hitched with some chick he met 17 days ago online. Wu Zheng. Boss. Brother. Ten years of marriage filled with affairs. His favorite sentence is... "This is how marriage works, get it?" -I don't get it. -There's no freedom after marriage? Look at me, I'm a living example of freedom. So... -It's not about getting married. -It's all about who you get married to. Brother. Your choice of wife influences your quality of life from here on. Be careful. She's got that itch. I should go help her out. Old Wu's hormones are raging. I admire him. I admire his wife more. It's said the worse a guy treats his wife in public, the better he'll treat her at home. Awesome. Me, Chen Feng. From here on, for the next 24 seconds, I'm still single. In our lives, there will be some moments, sometimes, somewhere, you'll meet somebody who's incomparably radiant, like a goddess coming down to you. Then a voice will arise from deep within your heart and your groin. There she is. And you are done. -Who's that girl? -Which one? The one in white. -How do you know? Why? -You don't have a chance. Did you see what kind of bag she's got? Don't go after such hard targets. There are so many girls out there. Just find one who's easier. Shoot for average and you'll never miss. Wait. What's her name? -Love at first sight? -Absolutely. When I was your age, I pretended to love girls just to get some. Actually, it’s just your hormones getting all riled up. Come on. Come on. You good or not? If not, it's on you to drink three big ones. -Neat. -Why not mixed? I'll just add extra for spunk. She shouldn't drink, I'll help her. You can't drink for her. The game's ruined. Hurry up. -Kiss! -Kiss! Hurry up! Feng! Don't hold back! -Get it on! -Get it on! -Get it on! -Get it on! She's such a straight-up good girl. You did it. I'm not drunk. Okay, bye. You're drunk, huh? -He's not drunk. It's easy to tell. Bye. -Bye. You puked so much. Let's go! I'll sober you up. Alright! Sober yet? Let's go! Sober now? I'll be going. -What are you doing? -Honey. I played along. Shouldn't you... hang out with me a while? Stop it, you'll bring the guards. How many girls have you brought here? Swear to God, you're the first. Really? How did you find this place? Haven't you seen any romance movies? They run to higher ground. After I found this place, I told myself... if I ran into the girl of my dreams, I'd just have to take her here. Who are you talking about? You're still drunk, huh? Speaking of romance, I've been wondering, when can I find that person? Yeah, if you jumped from here today, I'd jump, too. -You're nuts -Why? -Why what? We just met today. -That's right. -If I jump, you jump. Why would you? -Why not? Don't you think that, with some people, even though you've known them for your whole life, nothing special will happen. But with some people, all it takes is one look and then you feel... it'll be forever. I just threw up. I don't mind. Shower first? After, after. You designed all of these? Took part. That Wu was my boss. We've got a design firm. Which one do you like? You design all these? Why do you live in such a dump? I've got to live close to work. And the landlord treats me well. Regular price is 4.2k, I pay 3.5k. -The apartment is great, but... -I like this one. That'll be my goal. You've been at it all morning! It's time to rest already! The landlord, I just told you. The apartments here are great. They're just not that sound-proof. Easy now. Can you just not shout? Condoms? We've used the last one. What now? Ammunition is low, range is short. Can't hit target. -What now? -Get rid of it. -No way. -Can you afford it? If you don't mind that I don't have a car or house or Beijing residency, let's get married. I don't have anything. But I'll try my best to earn it all for you. I swear I'll bring you and the baby happiness. Don't cry. It's not a big deal. No big deal. Where the hell have you been? Why didn't you show up earlier? I wanted to ask where have you been? I need a time machine. You regret it, don't you? If I had a time machine, I'd go back to kindergarten, be by your side protecting you. If ever ghosts or devils frightened you, I'd smack 'em hard! And tell them, "You see this kid? She'll be my wife." That way, when you grow up, your first love, first kiss will all be mine. Yan. Come here. -Talk to her. -Okay. -Come here. You two go upstairs and talk. -Mom, you go up first. -Well... Ma'am, I'll stay down here. -Alright, you two enjoy yourselves. Doing anything in excess is bad. In only three months, you've gotten skinny. I understand. The relationship is still fresh. You can't get enough. Just wait six months. You'll be bored. What is it? Talk to me. -I'm getting married. -I'm getting divorced. -What? -What? DIVORCE CERTIFICATE What do you mean? I delivered on my promise. -I'm free now. -So? Come back to me. Marry me. There's no way. Still upset with me? Still punishing me? Or something else? -I'm getting married. -Getting married? -Getting married? -Getting married? -Getting divorced? -Getting divorced? -Yes. -Why? My wife was giving it up to another man. -It wasn't a misunderstanding? -No. When I saw them, they were loosening their belts, just about to whip it out and go at it. -That's a misunderstanding? -Okay. -This... -Okay. Getting married? -Why do you want to get married? -You've thought it over? Has someone taken nude photos -and blackmailed you? -Did you get her knocked up? Even so, it's not worth it, Feng. Just take this thing in front of you as a painful lesson. Can't you see? This is the figure rising from the ashes. The road right ahead is a huge pile-up. -You're not pumping the brakes. -But pumping on gas. Why are you doing this? I feel relaxed and happy with him. Compared to you, he has nothing. -But he's real. -Real? Well, how long do you think this happiness and realness -can last? -I have it now and that's enough. -Marriage isn't a game. -How can you say that? He's from a small town. His parents are nobody. He doesn't have a house or a car. A so-called "designer" rents a 30 square-meter apartment. He only makes 6,500 a month. With bonuses he can't make 100,000 a year. In a place like Beijing, you would marry him? Say it. Why? -Why do we humans have to marry someone? -Yeah. And why can't she admit -that she's a slutty ho' bag? -Right. To Pingod Villas. -Don't barf in my car. -If I do, I'll buy you a new Benz. -You're full of it. -Mr. Lin. Sorry, I'm eating with the wife. We'll talk in the office tomorrow. What was that? Fools lie to their wives for mistresses. I use my wife to keep the fourth mistress at bay. Brother. -Haven't you had enough? -Enough of what, man? When I was your age, all I did was work all day. Now that I finally have the resources, I should enjoy myself. Too old to get it up. Later. I'm coming. You want to marry Shen Yan. Where will you two live afterwards? Live here? Shen Yan's ex-boyfriend is a rich man. He was good to her. I don't have money but I'll treat her well just the same. How can you? She doesn't need to marry a rich person, but at least someone with a house. Marrying without a good place? Absolutely no way. How much do we have? 167,452.28 RMB. No way to get a house in the suburbs. Even the furthest out are all 200,000. Why don't we just get rid of the child? It isn't the right time yet. It's a life we're talking about. I won't be able to hide my bulge any longer. I've designed so many houses but I don't have my own. I'm a total bum. I'm sorry. Who is it? A friend. What do you mean? I picked a house for you, 280 square meters. It's not that big, but it's enough for the two of you plus a kid. It's right downtown. Only ten minutes’ walk to your work. Bring your ID to settle the formalities. I wish you two a happy marriage. -You asked me to come here just for this? -I've heard that your mom won't let you marry without a house. What's the catch? I'm going to Dubai. Come with me for three days. If this was before, I'd throw these keys in your face. But I won't now. A bad temper is bad for health. If you care about the baby, you won't let it live in a rented apartment. What the hell do you want? Is it that hard to understand? I just want it to be like before and relive what we had. Make up for the hurt I caused. I know you won't take any charity from me. So... just consider it a trade. -You just don't want to be seen losing. -Actually, I just want to see how strong "love" is when facing reality. This house is worth 20 million. Most people can't make that much in a lifetime. Right now, it's here in front of you. Guess. What choice would he have you make? Where did you go? Didn't you take off from work today? I just went to see a friend. Is there something going on? How come you're all like this? Nothing's wrong. What did he want from you? -Stop it. -Let me listen. I've changed my mind. You don't have to come with me to Dubai. Come to my house tomorrow at 9AM. I only want you for two hours. Sneaky bastard. It's more than a fair trade. Two hours for 20 million RMB. -Wait. -Ten years ago, I would be just like you and throw the money back in his face. But now, I wouldn't. Why? Time, time. It's taught me many things. Some things... we thought didn't exist, we come to discover they're actually real. But some things we firmly believe in, after some time, we find out they never existed at all. -Like what? -Love. -Love? -You're disappointed, right? But that's the truth. After being married ten years, I finally found out the first half of a person's life is all about passion. The last half of their life is affection, with some affairs thrown in the mix. What's love? It's just like a ghost. Everyone's heard of it, nobody's seen it. I'm not saying this to tell you how to choose. I'm telling you to give the choice to Shen Yan. Because, in the end, this trade has nothing to do with you. This is the best advice I can give you. I've got a date with a girl. Sweetie. Those clients were awful. They'll drink you to death. No! Sorry, the number you have dialed is powered off. TYPE IN PASSWORD WRONG PASSWORD TRY AGAIN WRONG PASSWORD TRY AGAIN Don't shoot this, come on. These men are terrible. Thanks. Thanks. People get drunk drinking alone. What if they're not alone? Then they get wild. I've been checking you out for a while. So what have you observed? I see that you're a lady with style. What style is that? The most feminine kind. Your style drifts over in a cloud of cologne, enough to cover the musk of the beast inside it. Really? All you can smell on me is cologne and beastliness? I have lots of different flavors. Have a whiff again. Why don't we go somewhere else to chat? You might find a flavor of me you like. The scent of my body must be all laundry detergent and cooking oil. Anything? No, nothing. You smell of perfume, just perfume. -Then why does he treat me like this? -Who? Before, he wanted to do it every day. Sometimes several times a day. Then it became once a week. Then once a month. Now, he only gives me a yearly bonus. Don't worry baby. Whatever your husband can't give you, I can. What now? How about you? -Me? -What about me? Are you married? Me... Does your wife also smell like household chores? Do you even touch her anymore? Lady, look. You're spoiling the mood. Crazy talk. I've never been married. You're crazy. You haven't answered me! Say it. -Say it. Answer me! -Answer what? -Say it. -Let me go. I’ll slap you! -Say it. -Say what? -Say it. -She's drunk. Crazy bitch. I don't even know her. Hey! Hey! -What's wrong? -Nothing's wrong. I'm going to take the plane early tomorrow. -The company's got some stuff. -Do you have time? I want to see you. What happened? Are you alright? I'm fine. I'm great. Saying "I'm fine" means something's up. Saying "great" means you're not great at all. You're going back to Hong Kong? It's for a vacation. Take good care of the company while I'm gone. -Especially when-- -Don't you want to take a shower? BATTERY LOW, 20% LEFT -Where are you? -The airport. Has anyone followed you? -No. -What about your wife? I told her I was going to Switzerland. -What about your husband? -I told him I was going to Paris. Then you're certain nobody's followed you? -Nobody. -Good. After I've arrived, I’ll send you the hotel and room number. All the men, sway like reeds in the wind All the men Floating on the wind -All the men... -What? Bridegroom, come. Sorry, I had to call the new groom over to keep me company. -What's going on? -Men... -All the men, sway like reeds in the wind -What's wrong? What's up with you? You two were a perfect couple that day. Got me too drunk. When I got home, my wife looked at my QQ and text messages and WeChat, even my private Weibo. -She searched through everything. -Found some sex photos? She even printed them out. Were you an idiot and used your birthday as the password? I'm not that stupid. It was our anniversary date. -All the men -What did she say then? Just one word... Divorce. Do you want to divorce? Men are like flowers, the flowers Are like... Divorce is for dumb-asses. So what if I sleep around? But... But I never imagined-- I never wanted to leave her really. I never wanted to leave her. What do I do? What do I do? As soon as she said divorce, I... I fell apart. It was like the sky fell down. What do I do now? Bro. I suddenly thought of a question. I'm not sure if I should ask it. Right now, do you think love exists? I'm here. I'll send you the address and room number of the hotel soon. See you later. You're beautiful. Come off it. What do you think your wife is doing right now? Don't you think that bringing her up will spoil the mood? No, it won't. I think it makes it more exciting. She must be working overtime right now. Well... -What about your husband? -He must be in his office... flirting with some staff. Don't you think you're underestimating him a little? What kind of cat doesn't catch fish? -He's got a history of filthiness. -Okay. Let's make a rule for tonight. Alright? -Yes? -I won't bring up my wife. You won't talk about your husband. Then what should we talk about? Let's talk about us. Okay. We'll just talk about us. -How did you choose this outfit? -I'd not be wearing anything. -Don't turn it on, I’m shy. -I want to see. It's not like you haven't seen it before. But I haven't. I hate you. What are you looking at? Something's wrong with you. What's wrong with me? Come on, this dish is getting cold. -No, no! -What's wrong? Your nose! You got a nose job. Didn't you? It's not called a nose job. It was a slight adjustment. As soon as I saw you today, I noticed something was up. Why did you change it? Who said I had a flat little pug nose? I just had it heightened a bit. It's not like I swapped it for a new one. Baby. How old are you? You should just leave things as they are. You always had such a pretty face. Take a look at yourself now. -It's like you've completely changed it. -Are you for real? It's only a nose job. We've been married 20 years. I just did my nose, I'm not a different person. Change one thing, might as well change wives. Out with the old, in with the new. You remember it's been 20 years. I came here all this way. Did all of this, everything, for this anniversary together. I want to celebrate this day with my wife, and not some other woman. You can just turn off the light. Dear. I'm begging you. I won't get any more face jobs, okay? Just don't look at my nose, okay? I'll get my nose put back to how it was, okay? How much did it cost to get that done? It wasn't too expensive. How much? Three thousand RMB. -That's crazy! -It will cost more to change it back. -Do I need to change it back? -We'll take a look at it tomorrow morning. -You'll get used to it. -That's right. -Turn on the lights. - What's wrong? I pulled a muscle. You forgot your calcium tablets. Nag. You absolutely had to play these love affair games. It made me really nervous. I flew for over ten hours to get here. Not even time for a drink of water. Why do you always blame me? When I made this suggestion, weren't you excited? That's right. I was. I also set the whole thing up and I played along with it. And in the end? -You changed your face up. -You're still not over that? I just changed it a little. I mean, seriously? If you're not up to it, don't blame me. Me, not up for it? Just now, I was so up for it. Think about how long it's been since you've been "up" for it. If it wasn't for this plan of mine... Think about it. How long has it been since we've even tried to get it on? Affairs are more exciting, anyways. I didn't do it for myself. I did it to satisfy your inner pervert. I'm a pervert? Look in the mirror. Take a look at your expression just now. What? What expression? Slutty. If I had a camera, I'd record it and make you watch, see how much you look like those little girls in Japanese pornos. Me, slutty? When I'm slutty, it's only at home. You get slutty everywhere. Didn't we agree not to talk about it? Why can't I? You're the one who did it. Why can't I talk about it? It's already so long ago. Is it necessary? How about this? In any case, this is our 20th anniversary. I think, since you can't do anything else tonight, we should play a little game. Haven't we been playing one all this time? Let's play another. Play what? Truth or Dare. I can't. Stop pretending. At your daughter's birthday party, you played it with her classmates. Some games shouldn't be played by husband and wife. It would be completely wrong. We've been role-playing all day. Why don't we continue? We're not husband and wife right now. We're secret lovers. -You're crazy. -Let's start. I don't want to. -You don't have a choice. -I refuse to play this with you. Okay. How do we play? Rock, Paper, Scissors. Winners get to ask. -Let's go. -Wait. You first have to swear. If you lie to me, your wife will be cursed. I swear. If I lie... my wife will be cursed. Come. Rock, paper, scissors. Ask away. -Actually, I don't have anything to ask. -Don't be like that. Otherwise, when I win, I'll feel bad asking you. Hurry up. Okay. This nose job of yours... How much did it really cost? You don't need to go so easy on me. I won't give you mercy. We'll see when it's your turn. Another thing. These boring games of yours can't last forever. Let's agree to five rounds, regardless of whomever wins. -We can't just keep going. -Alright. Are you sure you want to ask that? Eighteen thousand RMB. I knew it, you didn't even lie believably. If you looked at our bank statement, you'd know. That's too cold. -It'll hurt your stomach. -If I don't eat them, it'll hurt my heart. Hurry up, round two. Rock, paper, scissors. Ask. -Last time, that 100,000-- -I know what you're asking. I lent it to my little brother. Next round. Rock, paper, scissors. Hurry up and ask. Don't be so slow. Hurry up. Do you have any... regrets in your life? Can I say two? Yeah. First, I never became a musician. Second, I never gave you a son. You gave me an angel of a daughter. Don't try to stir up emotions. I still want a turn to ask you. Rock, paper, scissors... You lost. -You lost. -I lost on purpose. If you didn't win once, it wouldn't be fair at all. -Ask away. -Are you ready? After that one time, have you ever cheated again? Why do you have to ask these kinds of questions? I was thinking of it, so I asked. I wanted to make sure. Actually, the answer isn't important. -The answer isn't important? -No. After all, at this age, would I ever divorce you? -Then why do you need to know? -I want to understand people. Men. After that one time, I promised you I wouldn't. So? So... I never did it again. -One round left, want to play or not? -Of course. -Rock, paper, scissors. -Rock, paper, scissors. Well, no big deal I guess. Think hard about it, only one left. You gave me this question. After we got married, did you ever have an affair? Yangyang. Hey. Yangyang. Yes. I'm in Greece with your dad. Why don't you tell him? -Yangyang. -Daddy. It's about that thing. Please let me be on the TV show. -Okay? -Well... I went to Europe with your mom this time just to get your school situation all sorted out. About that talent search program, I still think it isn't a good move for you. Okay. -I understand. -Well, that's it. Isn't it a little harsh to be treating Yangyang like this? Once she's all grown up, she'll realize we're doing it for her. Believe me. In this world, there is nothing more important to me than the two of you. I never answered your question. Don't. Why? We've already lived half our lives. Some things... are just not that important. But we've spent so much... Money just for tonight. We're running at a loss here. But... Here. Well? -You... -Always be prepared. We've got to wait 40 minutes. I'll wait with you. What's it taste like? Sweet? Sour? Salty? Or something else? I think it depends on whatever the girl just ate, right, Songge? Actually, it's just... warm. Smooth, fragrant, sweet. When will a girl ever want to kiss me? Just wait for one. Heihou's back doesn't give off any light. Pudge has got a little bit. I'm Songge. I have a secret. I've been different since I was little. Because I can see other people's auras. She's here. Help me put my bike somewhere. -Wow. -Wow. Her name is Liu Xingyang. She's in Class Three. She always takes route 127 to Wu Ke Song. See? Just like that. I can always see the auras from people's backs. Although not so many have them. I can still spot them in a big crowd. And I've gradually figured out these auras. Kids have them more often. Adults, much less. Women, also more often. Men, not as much. Some people used to have an aura, only to slowly lose it. People who don't have it never get it back. But that day, on her body, I saw something more beautiful than the auras. That's right. That was the first time I'd seen something more beautiful than the auras. What's the matter? You're coming back later and later. -Make-up class. -You're a freshman. Make-up already? Hurry and eat something, it's getting cold. Let me tell you. Just to get you into this better high school, your Father and I had to spend all of our savings. You have to do your best. Study well. Do you hear me? Make us proud. When I was little, my mom's back gave off an aura. But later on, I slowly realized it was disappearing. Especially when she prattled on like that. No auras at all. But me? I've never been able to see my own aura. There's some obvious conflict with my special ability. So, it’s always made me very confused. Some people are just bad at making money. How about their parents? You're the only cellist in our school. We've spent all this time rehearsing. You say you can't go, so that's it? You're holding all of us back. That’s right, you're letting us down. Everyone is waiting to see us play on TV. How can you be so selfish? You got us all excited for nothing. Yeah. It's like you tricked us. Hey you, Peeping Tom, what are you looking at? -Give back the basketball. -Yeah, pick it up. What are you looking at? I'm talking to you. I'm telling you, if we can't play ball, I'm gonna hit you. -Hurry it up. -Check out how you walk. Like a total sissy. You gonna do something? Come on, hurry up. Shit. -Pile on him, pile on. -Get off. -Squash him. -Help! I'm coming. No! -Hello. -Hello. I'm Liu Xingyang, from Class Three. I'm Songge... -from Class One. -I run into you every time I take the bus. I've never noticed. What stop are you? I'm... The stop right after Wu Ke Song. Why did you guys fight today? Well... We weren't fighting, just messing around. -This is me. Bye. -Bye. -The next stop is called Yu Quan Lu. -Okay. How come your bow is broken? Well... See you later. If you're not in a hurry to get home, do you mind hanging out for a while? -Do you know the China Dream Show? -That TV talent show? Our string ensemble wants to go on the show and perform. Really? But my parents won't let me. Because of me, nobody gets to go. So everyone's blaming me. I just got really mad and... Why won't your parents let you? They say there's no point because I'm going to a music school in England soon. England? That's far. But performing on the stage on TV here is my biggest dream. You have to go! You're different than others. Different? I've seen you guys practice. I think you're incredibly special. Just don't tell your parents and go anyways. I need to go to Hangzhou for the show. The allowance I've saved up... -isn't enough. -Okay. -That's just like it. -That's just like it. SICK NOTE Hey. Where were you these past few days? Sick. Sick? -What were you sick with? -Nothing serious. -This is for you. -For me? How beautiful. A white bow! I hope you can use it while playing on the stage at the China Dream Show. What's wrong? I can't go. Isn't it just a money issue? Don't worry about it. Leave it to me. -You must go. -You? Yeah. It's not a lot of money to me. But... How can I take your money? Just think of it as me lending it to you. Once you get it, just pay it back, okay? Liu Xingyang. Aren't we friends? Friends? BFFs! I always see you wearing those. What are you listening to? Let me take you home. Spend more time with me. I don't want to go back. Okay. Where do you want to go? -Wherever we can watch the sunset. -What? Where is it? We didn't make it. What now? -Why don't we... wait until sunrise? -What? Here? You chicken? I'm not afraid of anything. For our dinner, we only have these milkshakes and cookies. What will you drink? I've got back-ups. Warm. Smooth. Fragrant. Sweet. That's the flavor of the first kiss in my imagination. Liu Xingyang. Hurry, the sun is coming up. Hey. -The sun! -The sun! -Beijing! Bye. -Beijing. Bye. Bye-bye! I have to go to England next week. If I go to Hangzhou, I'll have to leave even sooner. -How long will you be gone? -I'm not sure. All of this was planned out by my parents. Actually, I don't want to leave Beijing. I don't want that, either. What do you need that much money for? It's really to help out a classmate. Grandpa, don't worry. You've been at it all morning! It's time to rest already. What's wrong with the neighbor's cat? It must be giving birth or something. Here you go, don't spend it on games. Don't worry, I've already given that up. -Don't tell your mom. -Don't worry. Grandpa. You're a person with a bright aura on your back! Liu Xingyang. -Take this 4,000 RMB. -I don't need it anymore. -Why? -My parents came back from abroad. -They're letting me go to Hangzhou. -Okay. That's great. I'll leave tomorrow. We'll record the day after. I'll be cheering for you in front of the TV. But after the show, I'll leave straight for England. When the show airs, I won't even be able to see it. Well... You can watch it online. So... We... Thanks for giving me this bow. I'll be sure to use it. This is for you. Thanks. Good luck, then. Email me or send me a QQ message. You too. I hope everything goes well in England. Let's go. I've got plans with Pudge and them. You go first. -Okay... I'll be going then. -Hurry up, go. I'm going, too. Liu Xingyang. Liu Xingyang. Come out. Look, he's flying! Hey kid. Don't run into anything. I am Superman! I can't see my own wings. But that day, I learned I could fly. Because anything is possible. I know I'll meet that girl again, that girl with wings. Liu Xingyang. -Hey. -Come on and say something. You're screwing up again. Say something. Okay... I know. I'm 66. -Year of the Dog -I'm 67,Year of the Cock. Good. What's good? Year of the Cock, that's good. If the girl is older by one year, highly auspicious. Is it okay for you to eat that many cold sweets? I've loved to eat it since I was a kid. I wasn't well looked after then. -I'd get cravings, always sick for more. -I have diabetes. It doesn't even have to reach my mouth, just looking makes my blood sugar rise. Let's just end it here. Okay. Old Wang's ninth blind date fell through, again. I don't know why he's this picky. I got fatter. They say time cuts you up like a butcher's knife. But I think time's more like the fattening for the slaughter. There are smurfs over the sea and mountain They're happy and smart They live in the green forest Happy things will come to you So smurf yourself a grin! -Mrs. Gao, I'm sorry. -No problem, don't do it again. Bye. Bye, Mrs. Gao. How is it going? He's way too picky. Really. How about this? Look! You're kidding. That's a movie star. -Way out of his league. -Doesn't she look like a star? This is my distant cousin, just returned from abroad, fifty-nine. Well... Be more specific. Divorced at 40, lived in America. But now she's coming back here. She wants to find someone from Beijing to settle down with her. Really? Does she have kids? She never had any. Such perfect qualifications. Let's not go through this again, okay? I'm a traditionalist, noodles with sauce. She probably has them with coffee. It can't work. We've already set a date. I'll go with you. Then let's make this the last one. Don't look for any more. If I need to find someone, I'll do it myself. Stop that. Stop that. Only eat 70 percent. Doctor said to stop before you're full. Don't eat so much starch. Eat more veggies. You know you should. Don't forget. Forty minutes after eating, go on a slow jog. Keep at it. Stop that. Quit fidgeting. I need to tell you. She's coming back from the USA. You have to show her the old Beijing Spirit! -She's coming. -She's here. She's here. My cousin, Xue Aijia. This is Wang Daqi. -I'm his cousin, that's right. -Wang Daqi's cousin. She's Mrs. Gao from our choir. -Hello Mrs. Gao. -Hello. Mr. Wang. -Hello. -Hello. -How about we sit? -Yeah. Let's sit. Everyone have a seat. Your cousin Zhao said you like lamb hot pot, so we chose this place. There are so few hot pot places in L.A. And none of them are authentic. That's right. How about we start eating, huh? Right, eat up, eat up. We'll talk and eat. Mrs. Gao, how about we go over to the supermarket to shop? Let them talk a while, huh? Right. You two get comfortable. We're just going to go get some things. In just the blink of an eye, twenty years have gone by. Beijing... there are so many places I don't even recognize any more. Life can just slip by in an instant. Time... is easier to spend than money. Mr. Wang, you're so funny. Why don't you speak more? There are three women at the table taking up the whole stage. I'm content just being the audience. When I was 40, I got divorced and lived the next 20 years in America alone. One day, I looked out my window and suddenly wondered, is any of this really me? I wanted to go back. I think I should find someone suitable to spend the rest of my days with. Mr. Wang, do you think that's a little silly? It's not easy to leave your homeland, as they say. Yes. Coming back is easy. Finding someone, that's hard. So many things depend on fate. Especially something like this. You be careful. Hold my hand. -Don't be silly. -Well... You don't want to hold my ugly hand anymore. -Hold my hand. -Here. What's your impression? Pretty cool. This is the first positive comment from you. I really mean it. I've got a call. I've got a call. Let's see what she thinks of you, eh? Lao Zhao. What? What are you saying? Really? I get it. I know. Old Wang. -What did you say to her? -Nothing. You said nothing, and she's already invited you to a movie? Looks like your old pickup tricks still work. See? I do what you say, and you get mad. I don't do what you say, and you get mad. You're making me do all of this, you know. I'm just messing with you. How could I be mad at you? Isn't that right, Old Wang? Let's find a place to sit down. -Alright. -Sit down for a while. Old Wang. You think... how long has it been since we've done it? I don't remember. It's been some while, at least. What do you mean some while? It's been years. -What do you want? -Can't you at least hold me? Hold me. Okay. Hey. Look at that sweet old couple. So romantic, -watching movies all day. -Let's be just like them when we're old. Of course. I haven't been to a movie theatre in years. What are you afraid of? Those two kids behind us kind of envy us. It's starting. Put on the 3D glasses. No, put them on like this. -That's right. -Just like that. How is it? It's great. How much love does it take To fill the sky with a red sunset? Mrs. Gao. This film is so moving. I've seen it five or six times. I still cry every single time. Do you think, in our lives, no matter how early or how late, it's possible to just once encounter this kind of true love? Won't that make life worth living? Mr. Wang. I'm almost 60 now. Do you think I have any hope? I think you do. -Really? -I do. The years flew by so fast. Gone in a flash. Yes. A person's life is gone in a flash. Just like a movie. Whether it's good or bad. Long or short. When the story is over, the lights turn on, and the seats empty out. At this age, I don't have time to take the scenic route. Mr. Wang. Even though I've only met you twice, I think you're great. I don't know how you feel about me. I think you're great. -Really? -Yes, you are. Thanks. But... in my heart, there's someone else. See you, Mrs. Gao. Look at you. They're just off watching a movie, -it's like they took your heart with them. -Well... I'm just a little uncomfortable. I'll be okay once I rest a while. Don't worry. You didn't ask her out to eat after the movie? I'm afraid that I won't like the same food as her. And what I like to eat are all foods she's not used to. Isn't it always like this? At first, to like something, you have to get used to it. Like when we first got married, you didn't like what I cooked for you. Right? So... then what happened? You ate it every day for years and years. That's different. What's wrong? -So you two aren't cousins? -No. So is this some kind of game? Or are you playing a sick joke? You just want to show off how great and devoted your husband can be? Or are you trying to show off how pitiful a lonely old lady can be? I couldn't understand at all why you turned me down. Now, I get it. There's a word in English that I'd use to describe old couples like you. Go away. What's going on here? A senior citizen love triangle? Let me ask you. She just said you turned her down. -Why would you do that? -Because of you of course! You keep throwing these women at me! You know what that is? It's embarrassing! Let me tell you. This is the last one. Absolutely no more! Why are you being so crabby? I'm doing it for your own good. -I don't need you to do it for my good. -I was doing it for you. Let me tell you, when you die, I'll just slit my throat. -Don't be like this. -I won't be a burden. OPERATING ROOM You're awake. Have some water. I want some fish soup. Don't blame me. If I cast you aside so easily and left, I would feel that in my heart. I'd never... I know. I wrote a letter for you. It's in the drawer of the writing desk. TO OLD WANG Old Wang, I'm really a little afraid. Afraid of what? I'm afraid that, if I go like this, I don't know what lies beyond. I don't know what it's like there. There's nothing to be afraid of. You can't get lost. Wherever you go, I'll be able to find you. Really? Definitely. You promise? I promise. -Let's pinky swear. -Pinky swear. Actually, as I understand it, whoever goes first is the lucky one. You won't have me to take care of you anymore, so don't be so hard on yourself. Everything else is easy. I've heard enough of your nagging to last a lifetime. Once I can't hear it, -it won't be part of my life anymore. -Go back. Go back and tidy yourself up. You've been here all night. Look at yourself. So sloppy. I'm telling you, I'm okay. There's nothing wrong, I'm okay. I'm sorry. Honestly, we've only met twice. I shouldn't have been that upset. I know you've come to apologize. That's not necessary. I want you to help me with something. Help with something? She's a really optimistic old lady. We lived very ordinary lives, but very fulfilling. Until one day, we got a checkup. The kidney cancer is currently critical. Eighty percent of it won't show any symptoms, but it's already spread to the lungs. Something like this will probably lead to lung thrombosis. She could stop breathing at any minute. So... you should prepare yourself. After she found out about it, she was depressed for two days and then it was like nothing happened. She continued singing and we continued living out our days. Then, one day, she said she wanted to find someone for me. Someone who could take care of me after she left. From then on, she was just like a matchmaker and started organizing blind dates for me. Old Wang, picture me with you as you read this. I'm not sure if I'll still be here or not. A whole life... gone just like that, so quickly. First, thanks for always being with me and for excusing my bad temper and for taking care of me and our daughter. Of course, you should thank me, too. You've got a bad temper yourself. One day, when I was thinking of when we first met, it was as clear as if it were yesterday. We've gone from meeting, to falling in love, to almost giving up, to persevering, and finally, we've reached the end. Thank you. Thinking about it, I haven't said those three words in a long time. This is all so terribly sappy, Old Wang. At least in this life, I love you. Mrs. Gao. It's Xue Aijia. Don't worry. Your husband Wang, just leave him to me. I'll help you take good care of him. Did you hear her? You don't have to worry anymore. Don't cry. Sing a song for her. Outside the pavilion By the old trail The green grass was endless The night breeze flows the willows The sunset My dear. Don't be afraid. Wherever you go, I'll be able to find you. I won't lose you. Wait for me at the front of the crowd. I love you, too. This life, or the next... I will love you. I remember someone once said, "Life is a fairy tale." A story. It could even be an adventure. Or a nightmare. But now I think our life is actually a fable. After all, it's a fable about love. About this thing. If you can divorce, do it. If not... persevere. Look. To speak frankly, it's about love and desire. I don't think your husband doesn't love you. I just think these ten years have dropped your desire. Desire requires something fresh. You see the pretty girls and boys on the street? But how many of them are doing it to find love? Bro, what do you think? To get what you want. Desire. Simple. Love, oh my god. -Desire hurts the body. -Love hurts the heart. You... What you want to say is girls need love. -Guys need desire, right? -One needs love more. So, in the end, love and marriage aren't that special. They're not an escape shelter from daily life. They're a part of it. Let me ask you a question. Meeting the right person at the wrong time, that's youth. Meeting the right person at the right time, that's love. Then what is meeting the wrong person at the wrong time? -Marriage. -Cheers. That's a good one. Cheers!
