I wanna be creative with an uncharacteristically ratty attitude that she justifies by the fact that she works in this dead-end shit-hole which she claims is a means to an end but really it's because she doesn't have the courage or the conviction to do all the really important things that she wants to do in her life.

Just became too much ag with the venues. Feds kept shutting us down ten minutes before the acts went on even when there was no trouble. 696 was killing us. Just some form that allows the police to discriminate. Can't knock his persistence, can you? To be fair, he ain't all bad. Well, if you allow all the paranoia. Oh, and the nutty girls saying they're pregnant with his kid and shit. Irony is, he was convinced I was messing him about just cos I weren't hanging off him like some wannabe side bitch. - Were you? - No. That's the trouble round here. Everybody reckons they know you. Thanks. Why'd you swerve my question earlier? I lived here till I was five. Then Basildon. Romford. Grays for three years. Suffolk for two. And then back here again. Rahhh, you a Traveller or something? Foster placements. You always been in Southend? Unfortunately. That's why we came up with Project B. Something positive for once.

Never-ending compliments with you, ain't it? Sorry. Er... You wanna come up? I've got some Mary Berry muffins in the oven if you'd like some. No! Alright, welcome to the Hilton. It'll do. So? - What? - Makayla, just fucking tell me. Oh, yeah, that. We've hooked you up against... Blaze. I know nothing about him. And that... is why I'm here. Best way to think about it is in two, like, categories. You wanna think about delivery and content. Some of the most intelligent people I've met are battlers. They're gonna try and throw you off, get up in your face. - Can you deal with that? - Yeah, alright. Can you keep your composure?

Dumped me in care, you mean? - What's her name? - Lisa. She works at this hairdressing place in town. Was going to go down there. Probably not a good idea. I dunno. Maybe seeing her'd be good to... What, ease her conscience? Fucking bet it would be. No. For you. Fill in some of these. What? I ain't smokin' it in the house, am I? Calms me down. Have you thought about other ways of doing that? Music? Exercise? Meditation works for some people. Look, Adam. I know you've been moved around a lot and things haven't worked out. I'm not going to pretend to know how that feels. I'm not going to do the whole Foster Carer 101 thing, and you don't need... Terry's gonna get me a flat. OK, but how about in the meantime, we try and make the best of this? She seems nice, Makayla. Yeah, she's alright. How long have you been into rap? - Always. - Oh, right. I'm partial to a spot of Ice-T myself, when the mood takes me. Oh, by the way, condoms are in the bathroom cabinet. Just top them up. Nothing worse than running out when you're on a promise. They ain't going anywhere near my barnet, trust me. If you're not feeling... - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm here to see Lisa? Oh, right. she's just finishing off her break, but... Do you want me to take your jacket? You can come over. Alright, see you later. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Just here. Tea? Coffee? Well, I'll just let her know that you're here. Alright there? So... What are we doing for you today then? Number two, all over. Fancied a change, huh? You sure about this, then?

When I had you, I was a year younger than you are now. You had five years. True. I was still struggling. You get help then, don't you? - That's why I went to social services. - Why not friends, family? - At the time, I didn't have any... - There must've been someone. Adam. Try to give Lisa the chance to answer your questions. Things hadn't been right for a long time, even before you were born. But... after Mum died, I really didn't cope very well. It became just you and me and those same four walls. I took you out when I could... down the playground, to Bobby Jo's for an ice cream. Milkshake. - Milkshakes. - Yeah. We'd take your toy cars and race them around the table. Used to chat to everyone in there. The owner used to call you sir, do you remember? Hmm. It's not because I didn't love you. It was the hardest thing I ever had to do. So why did you? I wanted better for you. So you dumped me on the social? It was meant to be a bit of breathing space so that when I had you back... - Had me back? - Adam. Do you want to take a break? You left me, Mum. I had to come and find you and even then, you turned me away. I did everything they suggested. It's just... getting the right help takes time. And you were doing so well with Theresa. I didn't want Theresa, I wanted you. I thought I was making the right decision. We all did. We? Me, the IRO person, your social worker. They... They forced you, did they? No. No, that's not... It was my decision. I just wanted a better life for you. No, you, you got the better life! I got dumped on strangers! - Right! - You have any idea how it feels thinking you should be grateful for living in someone else's home knowing you're only there to make someone feel better about themselves and it's only a matter of time before they make a call and you have to do it all over again? I wish... I wish that you had given me up at birth! That way I wouldn't give a shit about you. - Adam, let's get some air. - It was down to you then, yeah? Adam... Adam! Don't do this. Come on, mate. Adam! Adam! Hi, it's Mak. If I like ya, leave a message. Come on... Hi, it's Mak. If I like ya, leave a message. ♪ Bitches know what they're here for ♪ ♪ They wanna turn up but won't fuck, I'm gone ♪ ♪ Filled lungs ♪ ♪ We all do this as well as we can ♪ ♪ This is more than just a minor hobby ♪ ♪ In fact, this is life... ♪ Shit, you look how I feel, bruv. Rough day? Definitely had better. You? Uh, woken up at 5:00 by the Portuguese couple next door having a barney lost two hours of my life in the post office and then burnt my legs out trying to get this one to sleep so, you know, horrendous. I bet The Nest is kicking off tonight. Fuck knows. I can't be arsed with them lot. I thought you was the man of the moment. The big cheese. Renegade Master. I'm sure Makayla still thinks you are. Do you ever think the world is spinning in a different direction to you? Thanks for the invite to the pity party. I think I stopped expecting things to go how I thought they would a while ago. But that's alright. Keeps it interesting at least. Stay for a drink? Why don't you stay at my mum's tonight? - OK. - 146. At least she don't get her looks from her dad. He weren't with Makayla at the time, if that's what you're thinking. He passed me off as some crazy slag at first then claimed he didn't want it ruining things with her or that it would make him an easy target or whatever and nobody's got the bollocks to call him out on it. - But he gives you dough, yeah? - Fuck, no. Got no job, no fixed address, the CSA aren't being much help. Anyway, it ain't all about the money. I just hate the idea that she's gonna grow up thinking he don't give a fuck about her. It just means that she's even luckier to have you. Turn over. Fuck... It's OK. Adam, stay. Ooh, I know! You alright? You alright? Ready. Come on, pull. Go on, then! Ooh, yes! You're gonna have to do better than that, come on. Alright, come on! Er... So I'll call you. Yeah. Only if you want. The horse's name was Wednesday. - What? - Yeah. As I said, I rode into town on a Sunday... I think we should go. I'm gonna go to the car. Thanks. - I tried calling you last night. - Yeah, sorry. My phone died. Saw my mum yesterday. Oh, great. How did it go? Yeah, it was alright. Is it gonna be awkward for you if me and Missy...? I'm neutral, remember? Should be a great battle though. Tickets have been flying already. - Listen, about the other day... - No, listen, it's OK. Don't worry about it. Alright. Well, see you later then, yeah? Yeah. See you later. You OK? So you told her to put me in care? Contact was erratic and deteriorating. Every time you saw her, you came back upset and confused and... agitated. She didn't even say sorry. - Maybe if it was just her and me... - I don't think that's a good idea. Hmm... Let's see once the dust settles, yeah? You've been doing really well.

It's a battle rap, I get it. You was prepared to do whatever it took. I respect that. But she don't. She wants battlin' to be this art form. She takes every syllable as gospel. I told her she needs to get a thicker skin but I guess that's what makes her... her. Yeah. Man runs like a turkey, you know. We gotta do this. We owe them. Slaughter. You know, I used to be like you.

Slaughter versus Adversary. It's on! I should have gone after him, got him to come back. There's no getting him to do anything. - Thank Christ. Adam, come on, mate. - No, Terry. - Enough's enough. - I can't do this. - We'll discuss this in the car. - Look, I'm sorry! Yeah? Look, I lied to you. I lied to you. I could've walked away and I didn't. You can put me in a secure residential, I won't do anything, I won't try to run away, but I need to do this first. - Adam... - Look, it's not for me! It's not for me, Terry. Please. You got this. So, what... I guess we should be grateful. You on it? - No bars held. - Ohhh! Three, two, one... Yo, yo, yo, people, thanks for coming out here today.
