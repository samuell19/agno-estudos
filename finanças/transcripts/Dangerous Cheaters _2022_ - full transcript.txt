Someone's still in here. Hello? Hello? I-is someone here?' Hello, I'm still in here! Hurry up! Help! - Ah! - 'Ah!' No.. I am all the things I have done I am all the things that I want Got to think about it got to dream about it Got to find a way to do the things That make you feel alright Got to think about it got to dream about it Got to find a way to do the things That make you feel... Aw.. Sometimes I feel like a blind in the dark Sometimes my fear it's my head in the sand But I don't care about it I'm just there to.. - You got this. - Come on, Kaley. I don't think about time Or maybe I'm just young young Young Or maybe I'm just young young Young Or maybe I'm just young.. - Yeah! - Yes! Oh but I feel - Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yeah! - You did so good. - Oh, my God.. Millie! That was insane! Hey, Kaley. Nice game. Thanks. Uh, glad you could make it. That's my girl! Oh, honey, you were amazing. - Congratulations. - Thanks. It was a blast! Well, of course, it was a blast. We won! Who wants to go celebrate? Daddy's treat. I can't. I have to study. The SATs are this weekend. It's my last chance to bump up my score. But your score was so good before like, hundreds better than me. Plus, we just won regionals! I know, but I-I just got to get through this. I got to know I gave it my all. Suit yourself. Monica? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to study, too. My junior-year scores were just not where I want them to be. - So.. - You guys are no fun. Hey, Olivia, Sebastian. I'm so excited. - You guys ready to party? - You're so good. Let's do it! - 'Oh, I'm so glad we could..' - Oh, wait. A little younger - Oh, you guys.. - Hey, Sebastian. No, you were just, just good. 'Seriously, you guys did a great job.' 'I'm so proud of you.' 'I know how hard you worked.' - Hey, guys. - Mm-hmm. It's ten o'clock. Why don't you get some sleep? Mom, the SATs are in two days. And I promise, you will ace them if you don't fall asleep through them. Just, uh, one more hour, I promise. Okay, honey. Goodnight. Goodnight, you two. - 'Drive safe.' - Goodnight, Mrs. Parker. 'We will.' Okay, I got to head out. Kay, you have a 4.0. Any Ivy League would be falling over themselves to recruit you. So stop stressing the test. I second everything that he said. And I need to go to bed, too, I don't think that I'm retaining anything anymore. Hey, Did you guys see Millie's Pixa? No. Why? 'Wow! Rich-girl party time, I guess.' - You okay? - Yeah, it's just.. 'Just what?' Me and Clea barely talk anymore. We used to be best friends for six years and then suddenly one summer, boom I'm out and Millie is her bestie. I can't compete with yachts and Bentleys. You don't need to compete with that. And you don't need them when you have me. No, I know. I'm sorry. It's stupid. I shouldn't even care anymore. And, in a way, I'm glad because it made us closer. It did. I just miss her sometimes. - You know? - I get it. I mean, come on. Who cares if Millie and Clea are on a yacht? They'll never have the coolest boyfriend on the planet. Ryan Gosling? - Next coolest. - Yeah. Well, you're a hundred times more adorable than Ryan Gosling. I'm just exhausted enough to accept that. Mm-hmm. Oh, love is so gross. I need to go to bed. - I'm done. - See you tomorrow. Bye. Don't stay up all night, nerd. - I won't, nerd. - Hm.. - Kay, I love you. Goodnight. - Okay, bye. Love you. You blocked me in, loser. Move your car. - Mn-mn. That'll be $5. - I love you. - Goodnight. - Bye. Okay. I need more coffee. Calm down, Fiona. It's gonna be fine. Why are you being a freak? There's nothing to worry about. She's prepared. She's got this. Breathe. She's got this. - Mom. - Well? Oh! I knew you were gonna do great! I mean, I ran out of time, so I couldn't recheck everything but, yeah, I think I did good. - I am so proud of you. - Kaley Parker? - Yes? - You forgot your phone. - Oh, gosh. Thank you so much. - Who is that? The proctor, he collected all of our phones in the beginning so that we wouldn't cheat. Clearly, he does not know my daughter. Mom! He's the proctor, he doesn't know anybody. He's just there to... proctor. Okay, my brain's officially mush. Okay, honey, let's go get some ice cream. Hey Hey Ah! My hand hurts. Who even writes handwritten thank-you notes anymore? Coach says it's a tradition, all the seniors have to do it. Ugh! Wait. What time is it? It's one minute till 5:00. Oh, my God. This is so stressful. I cannot believe that we had to wait two weeks. 'That's torture.' Wait. Why do I care? I don't even believe in standardized testing. I'm gonna be a stylist. You don't need good SAT scores to be a stylist. They don't even use math or geography... - They're in. - Okay. No matter what happens, we're really good volleyball players. We are funny and smart and.. really cute. I got a 1490. - What? - No way. That's, like, really good, right? 'How'd you guys do?' I mean, definitely not a 1490. Hey, Clea? 'Oh, my God, a 1460?' Told you that SAT prep course is worth it. Wait, what are you talking about? Okay, whoa, calm down. Look, we will talk about this later, okay? I'm in the middle of something. Everything good? Ugh! She's just freaking out over whatever. You know how dramatic Clea can get. I just, like, can't deal.. I wanna throw a party. I'm sure my dad will let me. - Hello. - Hey, dad? Big news. 'I got a 1490 on the SAT.' That's my girl! I knew you'd do great. It's like a huge boost from last year. You're proud of me, right? Are you kidding? I'm over the moon! - So can I throw a party? - Absolutely. In fact, you know what, I'll order the food right now. 'Ooh! Thanks, dad!' - Hey! He said yes! - Shh! So is your dad gonna be there? What? Just asking. Hey! You girls made it. - Hi, Mr. Gant. - Hi, Mr. Gant. The pizza's here. There's plenty of sodas, snacks. You girls just help yourself. I'm gonna, uh, be in my office, just doing my thing. - And you girls have some fun. - Okay. - Well, thanks. - Bye. Oh, my God, is it just me or does Mr. Gant get hotter every time that we see him? - I-I-I'll be back in a sec. - '...my control? I'll be..' - Mr. Gant. - 'Millie, seriously.' You are freaking out over nothing. I need it back, Millie. It was my mom's. Please. - No, Clea, we had an agreement. - My mom knows I lied to her. - I have to tell her. - About what? I have the proof. It's on my laptop. I mean, I wasn't sure. I took notes, but... But what? You're not making any sense. 'Hey.' - I was just looking for you. - Great, come dance. I'll catch up, you go ahead. I wanna be - Hey, are you okay? - No. - Actually.. - Do you wanna talk about it? Why, so you can guilt me about what a terrible friend I've been? - No, Clea, I just wa... - Stop! Okay? My world is blowing up right now. I made a huge mistake and I'm trying to correct it but I really don't need you to judge me. Just leave me alone, Kaley. - 'My arms are freezing in.' - Bye. Did you, uh, did you girls have fun? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Good, good. - Oh, wait. I didn't say goodbye to Clea. Oh, I think everyone pretty much left. Oh, well, her purse is over there. And I can see her car out front. - So.. - I'll call her. Voicemail. Although we got into a fight tonight. - So we might not be talking. - Okay. That's not like Clea just to leave her car. We should go look for her. Yeah, okay. Okay. Sounds good. Let's go. Um, Steve! - 'Clea?' - Hey, Clea. - 'Clea!' - 'Clea.' - 'Clea!' - 'Clea!' - 'Clea?' - Clea? - 'Clea, where are you?' - 'Uh..' 'Clea. Clea.' - 'Clea.' - 'Clea.' 'Clea?' 'Clea!' - 'Clea!' - 'Clea!' 'Clea? This isn't funny.' - 'Clea!' - Clea? Uh, what is it? What is it? What is it? What? What's happened? They lied to me Look what they've done.. Hello, 911. 'Yes. There's been an accident.' How can I fly back? How can I fly back to heaven Without my wings? Oh-oh oh-oh I am lonely I am lonely What happened here? What they've done to me? You okay? I overheard the paramedics say that.. she probably died on impact. - But, I mean.. - 'Oh, my God!' Just how long do you think she was lying there, alone? Oh, my God! 'I know.' She's acting like nothing ever happened? 'Good morning, West Brook Hill students.' It is with a very heavy heart that I regret to inform you that one of our students, Clea Braverman died in a tragic accident this weekend. 'A special memorial alcove has been set up by the front entry' 'if you would like to leave a note' or a memory or a message of hope. 'We will have staff of guidance counselors available' all this week should you need them. Please join me in a moment of silence to remember Clea Braverman. The board seems really positive about all the potential options. Yeah, well, you are the board president so I'll take your word for it. Just let me know what you need, I'm here to help. Alright, take care. Kaley, how are you holding up? I'm okay. Uh, thanks, Mr. Gant. I'm so sorry that you girls are going through this. If you need anything, just let me know. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. So, how are you really holding up? I know Clea and you were close. In middle school. I'm okay, I guess. I just don't really know how to be. Grief is strange. There really is no set way to be. - Ms. Wells. - Yeah. T-there are rumors going around that Clea was drunk and fell. But she was allergic to alcohol. They're doing an autopsy, but I know that wasn't it. And something was really bothering her that night and, and I just let her go, and I.. Hey, Kaley. It's not your fault. If you ever need to talk, I'm here, alright? Okay. - Uh, I need those. - Ah. I have to give 'em to all of the teachers and it's gonna take me, like, forever. - C-congrats. - Why? Your-your scores? They're over 1400. It's really impressive. Thanks. Right? I mean.. Hey, you nerds can't dominate everything. 'Eleven people got 1400.' Millie doesn't even seem affected and she and Clea were really good friends. Honey, you never know what happens behind closed doors. I mean, people grieve in their own way. It just seems weird. Clea got a great score and she was devastated by it somehow. Then she dies? And then I just found out that 11 people scored over 1400, including Sebastian. - So? - I saw his practice test. He barely cracked a 1000. How did he suddenly jump 400 points? I think you need to be happy for everyone... It's just that I've wanted to go to Bentonville since I was like, ten, mom, and it feels like these other kids just jumped the line somehow. We come from different worlds, okay? And I like our world. It's late nights and hard work and messy sometimes but it's real and it's ours. And no matter what those other kids do you will always be my all-star. Thanks, mom. I like our world, too. 'Students, a special lunchtime announcement.' 'We would like to extend congratulations' 'to many of our students' 'who received their SAT scores this weekend.' A record number of SAT scores came in over 1400. 'In fact, eight of our students scored among the highest' 'in the district.' This is a West Brook Hills first and you should all be ver.. See, I told you that class was fire. Gotta say, it seems totally worth it now. I needed a bump like this with my, uh dips in performance. Dips? More like massive craters. Ah! - Hey, that hurts. - I'm just messing. Have you ever known anyone sitting over there to make the honor roll? And they even passing the AP classes? No, but some people test really well. The last test that we took, Olivia used the entire sheet to blot her lipstick, so.. - Uh.. - I mean, really? - They all scored above a 1400? - They're loaded, K. That could buy you some pretty impressive prep classes. Plus, it's a huge industry. 'It's turning those guys crazy.' 'Oh, my God! You're hilarious.' Hey, we can just be our own club. The Destined For Greatness Through Merit And Hard Work Club. Oh. - Okay, the name needs work. - Yeah. Hey, I know Millie and Clea were in our test group. But what about Seb and Liv, did you guys see them there? Yeah. Sebastian hums when he thinks. I had to move. What about.. these kids? I remember Susan, Molly and Tim. I'm not sure about the others. - Any way we could find out? - Yeah, it's pretty easy. There should be a log in the database for our test. - What? - Jax.. You know I never ask you to break the rules, but... - You're about to ask me. - Yeah. You want me to figure out which kids on this list were in our test group? Actually, I want you to find out which of the kids on this list were in prep class and our test group. I know Clea was in both, and something was bothering her about it. I'm just having a hard time believing that they would all score so high. - Kaley. Kaley. - Kay, Kay. Where are you going? 'Get back here!' - Hey, Kay. - Hey, you guys. I guess I should be congratulating all of you. - Oh, thanks. - She's being sarcastic. Is she? Oh. Millie, I, I got to ask. How'd you do it? - The prep class? - Maybe. Maybe I'm just naturally smart. Sure, but.. Oh.. Harsh. What are you saying? Just seems like that course was really worth it. I guess it was. What do you care? Well, I'd wanna take it if it's that effective. I told you about that class months ago. So now that you see the results, you're just all about it? You know what, Kaley, maybe I'm just smarter than you and you can't handle it. Oh, I can't even look. For once you're not the best, and it's killing you, isn't it? I'm gonna go find chem, if I'm not too dumb, that is. Millie, that's not.. Just leave me alone, Kaley. - Kaley. - Hi, Mrs. Braverman. This is from the volleyball team.. Please, honey. Come in. Thank you. The Gants just stopped by to, uh, drop these off. They're beautiful. Kaley, yours are beautiful, too. Beautiful flowers for a beautiful home. - 'Thank you. That's nice.' - Again, I'm so sorry. Well, it's nice to see you, Kaley. Ella, we'll be back again later this week to check on you. - Thank you. - Yeah. Bye. Let's go to the garden, shall we? It's much nicer out there. I really hate that Gant girl. Clea was disposable to Millie. And worse, Millie made her feel ashamed.. about me and about herself. And that's the part that I find unforgivable. We got into a horrible fight that day. Why? She, uh.. 'She had taken something from me.' 'What do you mean? I mean, what did she take?' 'A ring.' It was my mother's. And it was this beautiful, gorgeous green emerald in a diamond setting. I was saving it for Clea's wedding day. She'd been asking me for money for months to take some class. I just didn't have it. And I hated disappointing her. But I knew she was somehow taking the class because she was so secretive. Was the class an SAT prep? I didn't discover the ring was gone until a week ago that's after she'd taken the course and her SATs. And she tried to calm me down by telling me that she got this remarkable score. But it was like she didn't even seem proud. It's okay. I promise I'll get it back to you as soon as I can. 'This is Jax. Leave a message.' Hey, new favor. I have Clea's laptop. Can you get me in? Her mom and I have no idea what her password is but, yes, for this you get to pick the next three movies. Love you. 'This is Jax. Leave a message.' Hey, it's me again. I have a flat. I'm headed home. But if you get this, pick me up. I'm headed up Chester Avenue. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me! Help! Stop! Help! No! We have to go to the police, Kaley. And say what? It was dark, and I can't identify anything. - They just wanted this laptop. - Then we have to tell your mom. She's gonna notice the spare tire. No. Please, Jax. Come on. She's just gonna lose her mind for no reason. Just tell her that I hit a nail, or something. I think it was Millie. She saw me looking at Clea's laptop. She must have hung out, and when she saw me leaving with it, she freaked. Okay, so she left Mrs. Braverman's changed into all black and then came back just assuming you had Clea's laptop? So she put on a jacket and a hat. She's been giving me death stares all week ever since I confronted her about her score. Okay, okay, that's a heck of a jump, Kay. Come on, a bunch of kids who have never cared about their grades suddenly get over 1400 on the SAT, including Clea. Then she has a problem with it, specifically, with Millie. Okay, so, again, let's go to the police. Okay, but first let's find some evidence. I think there's something on here. Okay, well, this thing is dead. I'll charge it and take a crack at it tomorrow, okay? For now, though, I did get the names of the 1400-plus kids who were in our test group and signed up for the same prep course. I knew you could it. And for extra credit, the name of the prep course they were all signed up for is Gevest Prep. I couldn't find anything on them except for a one-page website that they started this year. The owner is Nat Gevest but he or she is completely invisible online. No campaigns, no advertisements, no websites. I need another day. I'm only one man. You are the best boyfriend ever. Take that, Ryan Gosling. Here, airdropping now. Okay, Millie, obviously Sebastian and Olivia Susan, Tim, Christian, Molly and Clea all attended Gevest Prep. That leaves.. Kim, Leslie and Aaron. The genius, the valedictorian and the top scorer from our tests last year. - They all make sense. - Exactly. It's these.. These don't make any sense at all. Millie, what? What are you doing here? Getting a pass. I'm leaving early, my dad is picking me up. Not that that or anything that has to do with me is any of your business. - Millie, can we just... - Save it. Hey, honey. Honey, you're ready to go? - Yeah, dad. - Hey, Kaley. Come on. Kaley, you have those copies yet? - Uh, yeah. I'm working on 'em. - Okay. 'Hey, mom, practice is cancelled.' 'So I should get home right after school.' 'Again, depending on the traffic.' 'Okay, bye.' 'A nine-year-old metro girl has a new lease of life' 'thanks to surgery at the hospital for sick children.' 'Tracy Plumber was given the liver of a nine-year-old accident victim' 'in a four-hour operation.' 'Plumber is in critical but stable condition' 'normal after such an operation.' 'Hey, mom. I'm heading home.' '...52 degrees. Clear tonight with a low near 41.' 'Tomorrow, more sunshine and slightly warmer temperatures' 'with the winds from the south at 17 miles per hour..' 'In sports, the National Hockey League featured' 'a visiting Flyers... late last evening.' 'The frontrunning Flyers ripped the Sabres 14-3..' - Hey. - Oh. Hey, honey. How was school? Fine. Uh, how was your day? I'm beat. I've been working 20 hours straight. There's lasagne in the fridge, but I'm gonna go to bed. If you find me passed out with my toothbrush in my mouth.. I'll take it out and tuck you in. - Thank you. I love you. - Love you, too. Goodnight. Who are you, Nat Gevest? - Ah! - I'm sorry! I'm sorry. It's me. I have ice cream! I have medicine! Come on. Hi. After this past week that you have had I thought that you deserved this. - You are the best. - Oh, girl, I know that I am. There you go. Here's your spoon. This is perfect. It's just what the doctor ordered. So how are you doing? Other than being attacked? Yeah, fine, I guess. And you did not see their face? No. But, uh, I'm pretty sure it was Millie. You think it was Millie? - Do you have proof? - Well.. I'm hoping Jackson can find something on Clea's laptop. Do you really think that she would attack you? You didn't see Clea that night, Mon. She was freaked out by something and it had to do with Millie. Something is up, from what her mom said she hasn't been herself for a while now. If there's anything to find out, it would be on that laptop. - Hey, Jax. - 'Hey.' - Anything? - 'Nothing yet.' There's nothing online about Gevest Prep or that guy, Nat, that runs it? 'No, but, uh, we can keep looking tomorrow.' That's so weird. Okay. Yeah, we can check it out tomorrow night. 'Sounds good. Alright, I gotta get some sleep.' - Yeah, I'm headed to bed, too. - 'Alright, sleep tight.' - Love you. - 'Love you, too.' - Alright, see you tomorrow. - 'Bye.' Mom! Mom! So you're not sure if this person was a male or a female? Okay, well, I will add that into the file along with the text messages and the threats... I don't think you'll find anything, I already asked my boyfriend, and he said that it was sent with an encryption app, it's untraceable. The person in the driveway, do you think that might have been the same person that attacked you? - Friday night? - Maybe. I can't believe you didn't tell me about that. I know, mom. I'm sorry. Look, we dusted the car for prints we're gonna put that in the system, but that takes time. 'I would suggest getting a security system.' Okay. Thank you. I know it's been a long night, I'm sure you want some rest but look into cameras as soon as possible. This feels personal. And if your daughter's being targeted, you can never be too... - Safe. - Exactly. Understood. If you think of anything else or if you're being harassed in any way or if you just want suggestions on security options, call me. Thank you. Mom.. Oh, it's okay, baby. It's okay. Kaley. I'm gonna need you to come with me, please. - And bring your things. - Ooh! Uh, I'm not sure... Kaley, I suggest you don't say another word until we get to the bottom of this. Understood? Okay. Please open your locker. Get back to class. Step away, please. Kaley. Is everything okay? Ms. Molina.. Get back to homeroom. Now, please, Ms. Molina. Anything? Okay. Good. Can you please tell me what this is about? I received a tip that there were drugs in your locker. You understand we must take allegations like this very seriously. I understand, but I would never... I know, but we had to follow through. - Can I go back to class now? - Of course. I'm sorry to have.. - 'You got to be kidding me.' - 'No, normally I...' Kaley is a great kid. We both know she would never steal a test. Unfortunately, the evidence proves otherwise. Clearly, it was planted. She's a whiz at chemistry. It doesn't even make sense. All my work shows how I proved everything. That answer key doesn't even show work. I agree, it doesn't, but there are consequences. Just tell me what I need to do to clear my daughter's name because you know her and you know her work. First, you need to tell me how you got a... I didn't, I wouldn't even begin to know where or how I would even get the answer key. Seriously, she's just not that type of kid. She doesn't even need to cheat. Normally I wouldn't have considered it but it's been a very chaotic time. Now, I know Clea's death has affected you, with good reason. Kaley, you seemed really upset about the high SAT scores. Maybe you thought by having the AP test it would give you a leg up. Maybe the pressure caused you to make some bad choi... Principal Wells, I don't know what's going on but I swear, I did not steal the test. It does seem out of character. Does anyone else know your locker combination? They don't need to. It's been broken since January. I asked Mr. Cleary if he would replace it.. Look, Kaley, this is your first infraction. And the tip was about drugs. So finding the test there does feel a little like... Like it was planted? You're free to go. Thank you. 'You're good, babe. There will be new drama in a week.' Literally everyone will forget about this. - Okay. - Also, you killed it. So don't get in your head. 'Kaley.' - I love you. - Love you. - See you tomorrow, Mon. - 'Bye.' - Bye. - Hey. How was volleyball? It was weird. It's hard to practice when your whole team is ignoring you. Oh, also there is a rumor going around that I cheated on the AP chem test. Listen, anyone who believes that obviously doesn't know you at all. I guess, but still, I'd rather a rumor going around about my vicious spike or my eidetic memory. You can read minds? I'm kidding. I know you have a photographic memory. I love my smarty-pants. Sebastian! Stop! Whoa! Whoa! Okay! - Jax. - Yeah. What now? - That's what I thought. - A tire iron. I.. It's just like the person in my driveway. - 'Are you alright?' - I'm fine. Well, you weren't the one that was attacked. - Okay? It was really scary. - Come on. It's okay. - Come on. - Jax.. Yeah. It's creepy, right? I mean, she was standing the exact same way. Okay, slow down. Creepy? Yeah. But, Kay, everyone has a tire iron in their trunk. And, come on, why would Millie do that? Power, if she figured out a way to cheat and shared it with the others, they would owe her, right? That's okay. That's a lot to risk. Why not just cheat on your own? I have no idea. - What? - The proctor. From the SATs, maybe he saw something. - Okay, how do we find him? - He's a librarian. There are six libraries in the general vicinity. How do you know that? You're such a nerd. Volleyball ghost party? doing this. Volleyball. 'Okay, what are we looking for?' 'Let's just start with the' 'closest library.' - 'Thumbs up with the proctor.' - 'I don't know.' 'I mean, I guess maybe' I'm reaching for straws' 'but I just wanna talk to him.' 'Don't worry, we'll find him.' Finally. - Excuse me? - Sorry. This is our third library. Okay. And can I help you? You probably don't remember me, but I left my phone when I took the SAT, I was the last one out. - 'Kaley Parker.' - Sure. Anyways, I know this might sound random, but do you remember noticing anything weird during the test? Weird? I know that there is at least two kids from our school that received scores that jumped a lot 'from the last time they took it.' Like, hundreds of points. Also, there were an unusual amount of scores over 1400 all from our school. So what are you asking me? Well, I guess if you noticed anything strange or suspicious, I'm sure that... Look, I-I'd like to help, but I really have no idea what you're talking about, also, if you are implying what I think you're implying, it's insulting. - 'But I think...' - 'Kay. Just come on.' Ah, sorry to bother you. What about Gevest Prep? Or Nat Gevest? You ever heard of either of those? No. Now, if you don't mind, I have an actual job to do. Come on. Come on. He's hiding something. We have a problem. That should do it. Hey, mom. Hey, detective. Hey, uh, Carl was just helping me install our new security system. - Carl? - I should probably go. Thank you, that was literally above and beyond the call of duty, and I... No problem at all, I installed my sister's system and then I did my own. I'm getting pretty good at it. You are. You should start charging. That's right, I did. I forgot to, uh, I forgot to invoice you. - Gotcha. - Mom, when's your day off? Oh, um, uh, Tuesday. Why? Detective Baxter, my mom is free Tuesday night. 'Just in case you're wondering.' Okay. I will call you. Okay. Bye. - What was that about? - Oh. I was overwhelmed with how to secure this fortress without going bankrupt, so I called him for some advice. Is that what they call it these days? Oh, stop it. So, bells, whistles and laser beams? It's a basic video door cam. Ah, we can see whoever's at the front door on our phones. So no more sneaking Jackson in late at night? I'm kidding. But he is coming tonight. Is that cool? Yes, honey, that's fine. I'm gonna be so late. And I'd rather you not be alone. - You have homework? - There's always homework. Yes. Clearly it has to do with the prep class they all took. Clea tried to buy in and it cost her everything. What's her favorite color? Purple. And her favorite number is 33. I mean, aren't the SATs supposed to be ironclad against cheating? Also, why wouldn't the proctor talk to us? Because he wants to keep his job. I mean, look, the guy was definitely intense but you were also kind of insinuating that he was shady. He's hiding something, I know it. Any other ideas for passwords? Nothing works with purple. Scooby-Doo was her favorite show as a kid. - So Scooby-Doo? - No. Try "Ruh-ro Raggy". I'm in! Okay, what are we looking for? I know she used to keep obsessive notes so try to find that or SATs or Gevest Prep or her mom's emerald ring. Okay, slow down. One at a time. Mm.. Well, there's paperwork from Gevest Prep here. Clearly, Clea took the course. Nothing on Nat Gevest. Oh, there, there! That's her notes. "Course isn't what I expected. "Seems the same as you can get anywhere "but four times the cost. What am I doing here?" Can you go further, uh, latest entries? - 'Oh, wow.' - 'See?' I told you that proctor was fishy. Do me a favor, uh, go to her photo album. - That's it! - What? Clea's mom's ring. Millie's wearing it. That means that Clea must have used it to get money to pay for the course. So? There's nothing illegal about that. Well, Clea wanted it back. I overheard them arguing. And she ends up dead? Okay, you just went from a stupid decision to murder. Why did she take so many pictures of whatever this is? Weird. I'll run some software to help see these better. Gonna go in later. Well, she listed her test scores. None of them were even close to over 1400. - It doesn't make sense. - Hey. It's okay. I'm gonna figure it out. Although, it might take a minute. What's a minute in hacker speak? Mm, probably sometime tomorrow. I can do some groundwork tonight. Alright, well, I'm gonna pass out. Do you have to go? No. I'll stay here till your mom gets home. - Protect you. - Thanks, Tarzan. - Do you mind if I head to bed? - No. Go knock out. I'm on duty. - Thanks. Love you. - Mm, love you. I need it back, Millie. It was my mom's. Please... No, Clea, we had an agreement. I have the proof. It's on my laptop. I made a huge mistake and I'm trying to correct it but I really don't need you to judge me right now. Jackson? Jackson? Jackson? Jackson? Jackson? Jackson? Jackson? No! 'Dr. McKay, is he gonna be okay?' 'We'll take good care of him. Don't worry.' That's it. Come on. Come on! You got it. You got it. You got it. Yes, that was good! Really good. 'I mean, I know you can do better, but that was good.' - 'Just gotta be...' - The best. - I know, dad. - Hey. What if you just can't be the best? I mean, there's always gonna be someone better at everything. Honey, honey, look at me, look at me. Money has afforded you a unique opportunity. The world is yours, you just have to have the confidence to own it. I know. But what if I'm not strong enough or, or smart enough? You are, though. Inside you know that you are. You studied, you really applied yourself in that class and look at you, look at you right now. You're amazing! - Yeah. - Yeah! You made the most of an opportunity and you did your best. I mean, I'm proud of you. I'm so proud of you. So what are you gonna do? - Own it. - What's that? I'm.. Sorry. - What did you say? Yes! - Own it. That's my girl, right there. Millie, trust me, if you just keep charging forward there's no stopping you. - No stopping me. - Never. - No stopping you. What's that? - No stopping... That's it. That's my girl. There you go. Great job today. It's gonna be alright, sweetie. I've known Dr. Browne since med school. Jackson's in good hands, honey. He's gonna be okay. Yeah, I know. Thanks, mom. Mom, I didn't see Clea's laptop. Whoever did this must have taken it and ran out the back. Okay, honey, I'll let Carl know. Are you sure you didn't recognize anything? It was dark and I was just so scared. And then I didn't wanna leave Jackson and... Okay, okay, okay, okay, honey. Okay, honey. I got you. It's okay, baby. Look, look, work gave me the day off. I already called the school. How about we just go crawl into bed? - Mm. - Okay, come on. We can worry about everything else later, okay? We could crawl in bed, you could get comfy.. 'We could watch a movie.' - 'It's a duct tape?' - 'Yeah.' It was still there this morning. Show it to me again. They were obviously expecting the camera. Yeah. After I saw this, I went back and took it off. I mean, your camera is not hidden, so they could have seen it on the approach, but they have the duct tape ready like that. That's premeditated. And I was supposed to run all the prints and the tracks at the lab. The person was wearing gloves. They know exactly what they're doing. I-I-I can still run the tracks, but, I mean, that's gonna take... It could take days for those to be processed and for us to get the results back. I like my crime shows. In the meantime, I'd like to come by and check things out myself. I mean, if that's okay with you. Honestly, I would really appreciate that. You know, there's one more thing. I think it would be a good idea for you to share your door cam link with the station. Just to be safe. Okay. Oh, my God. He sent this last night? Hey, so I can't crack her cloud account yet but I think in a day or so. Um, also, I emailed myself the photos so I can run an enhancer, but it takes a while. And I think you're right. Thumbs up with the proctor. And you know what, I can hear you snore from here. It's kind of cute. City Library. This is Clark Jenson. How can I help you? Mr. Jenson, this is Kaley Parker. I came to the library the other day. - I have nothing to say to you. - Please don't hang up. I found something on Clea's laptop. I-I don't know who-who you're talking about. Clea Braverman died because of something to do 'with the SAT that you proctored.' - Can we meet somewhere? - Yes. Yes, I'll, I'll figure out a place to.. Uh, K-K-Kaley? I'll get back to you. Okay, so I've got a patrol car that's gonna come by every few hours and just check on everything. Thank you. Kaley, are you sure you don't want me to take your laptop into our forensics unit? Well, how long will it take them to check it out? Wish you guys wouldn't watch so much TV. Um, by the time it's processed, probably a few days. No, thanks. I-I'm gonna go see Jax. - Can I borrow your car? - Of course, honey. I shouldn't be too long. Jax, are you sure you're okay? Jax? I-I think this can wait. I shouldn't.. Kay, I need to do this. This person threatened you, attacked me now hacked into your computer. - 'I can do it, okay?' - Are you sure? - I would just rather keep... - I need to, Kaley. Good news is it's pretty standard spyware. Easy to wipe. I'm just trying to find an originating IP where it came from, who installed it. - Basically, catch the bad guy. - Now, that I understand. How long can you survive without your laptop? A day? Two? Okay. It won't be that long, but I-I do need... I get it. I'm out. Alright. Call me when you can. I will. Kaley? Please be safe, okay? I will. love you. I love you, too. Now let the maestro work. Okay, creeper, let's see who you are. 'Hey, mom, I'm on my way home.' 'Good. Carl has some news.' Police autopsy report came back. - What did it say? - She wasn't drinking. There's no alcohol in her system. I knew it. She was allergic. There was also some bruising on her upper arms consisting with hand marks. She was grabbed or pushed. It means we can't definitely rule her death an accident. Whoa. No.. No! Whoa, whoa! I won't say anything. Hey. Are you okay, kiddo? Yeah. You think I'm smart, right? Of course. You're my kid! Brighter than bright. Like, 1490 smart? You know, with the proper support, like Gevest, 100%. Hey, sweetheart.. the future is yours to claim. Star volleyball, perfect SAT, perfect dad. Is that something that colleges look for? You know, maybe in the essay portion, just.. Dad, I don't know what I would do without you. Same. Love you. Ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh Daddy didn't play no games Wouldn't let her trade her name for a fake I do Oh you better know what you're getting into Ooh Is it just me, or does this name seem weird? Maybe I've just been looking at it too long or it's my handwriting or something. Oh, speaking of handwriting coach wants us to finish the thank-you notes for the team sponsors before the spring banquet. So here's the full list for you. - Oh, my God. - 'What?' - Monica? - What? What is happening? Monica, look, Nat Gevest is an anagram. Wait, Mr. Gant? Okay, uh, I don't know. I mean, it's just a random assemblage of letters. Really? There's no footprint or info on Nat Gevest. Millie's dad is rich, and she just aced the SATs along with some of her other rich pals just by taking a prep course, the one that is run by an anagrammed name for her dad? Okay, I-I mean, it is weird but I just feel like it's a coincidence. It's not a coincidence, Mon. Okay, fine. 'This is Jax. Leave a message.' Jax, Nat Gevest is an anagram for Steve Gant, Millie's dad. - 'Call me when you can.' - Kaley. Clea definitely knew something, okay? So you have to be careful, please. - I promise. - Thank you. - 'Are we leaving?' - Yeah. Come on. Let's get out of here. - Hold on, wait! Oh! - Come on. I'm slower than you. So what can I help you two with today? Are you aware that Gevest Prep, the company that ran the latest SAT prep course is actually connected to Steve Gant, Millie Gant's father? I am. Oh, I didn't know it was public knowledge. If it's not public knowledge how is it that you know his connection? I just, I did some digging I'm pretty proficient at the Internet. If Mr. Gant is the proprietor, how is that illicit? - Are you kidding? That is tot... - Kaley. So you're telling me that if I ran an SAT course and my daughter and her friends attended that wouldn't be a problem? Certainly not, as long as it was an accredited course recognized by the college boards.. - It would be fine. - Really? You don't find it strange that after taking her dad's class 'Millie suddenly aces the SAT' along with her friends who don't normally... It is not illegal for one of our most active and involved donors to want his daughter and others to succeed. Kaley, it's only a test. Your records speak for you. Thank you for your time. That's it, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this one way or another. Hold on. I have a message from Jackson. 'Hey, hope you're okay.' 'I am getting closer to the camera creeper.' 'Shouldn't be long. I'll call you super soon. Love you.' I'm gonna call Carl on the way home, give him an update. I don't care what Principal Wells says Steve Gant's involvement is a conflict of interest. What? Tonight we have our game against Parsons. - I think you should skip it. - Mom, I can't miss it. That would jeopardize my co-captain status. I can't... - Honey, it's just... - 'Mom.' It's here, it's a home game. - It's too risky. - It's fine. It's a huge game, I'll be surrounded by people and I'll text you every ten minutes. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? Hey, hey, what are you, what are you, what.. So proud of you! I'm so proud of you. That was so good. You're a winner! What is your problem, Millie? What are you and your mom talking about my dad for? His SAT class that you and your friends paid big money for you know, the one that got you all over 1400. Shut up! Just shut up! I studied so hard for that test! Why is it okay for you to keep insisting that I'm too stupid to get a good score? I can, you know? I'm smart, Kaley! There's just too many questions, Millie. It's too high for anyone, not just you. But you don't know everything! You're just jealous and upset that you didn't do as well as stupid Millie. You've always thought you were so much better than everyone. - No, I don't! - Yes, you do! And now you just wanna ruin it for everyone else. Millie, I really.. Watch it, Kaley. Now do you believe me? I'm telling you, Millie is in on this. She just freaked out at the chance that I expose her. We just don't know that for sure. You didn't see the look in her eyes, Monica. - She's dangerous! - She is moody! I promise you, babe, it's literally all in your head. You're gonna be fine. Do you want me to stay here with you? I'm okay, I'll be fine. I'll see you tomorrow. Hug me. I love you. Congrats. - You, too. Mm.. - For winning. Text me when you're home, please. Yes. Um, someone's in here. Monica? Hello? Hello? H-hello? I-is someone here? Whoever this is, this isn't funny. Hello, I'm still in here! Come on. Come on, hurry up! No.. Ah! - Ah! - No, stop! - Get off! - 'Kaley!' I forgot my Calculus book. Oh, my God, Kaley. Wait, are you okay? Someone here and he... Okay, okay, I'm calling an ambulance. You're okay? No, it's okay. I just wanna go home. - Are you sure? So.. - I just wanna go home. I-I.. Butt-dial, sorry. Oh, my God, are you okay? - Come on, I got you. - Ah-ah.. Okay, I'm here. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left you. Okay. Okay, alright, I'm gonna get you home. 'I don't see anyone. So we're good.' - Okay. - Ah! - Here's your bag. - Ah! - Hm, come on. - Hm. Do you see anyone? No, I don't see anyone. - 'How are you feeling, honey?' - I'm okay. Nothing a few aspirin and a bag of ice can't fix. I talked to Carl, and he agrees we have to file a police report first thing in the morning. No, I-I'm okay. Honestly, I-I can't thank you enough, Monica. I mean, if you hadn't have been there, then... But she was. Mom, don't go there. It's just, I can't, I can't even imagine... Then don't. I'm okay. Bruised, but I'm okay. And we'll spill everything to the police tomorrow. I promise. Millie and her dad are not gonna get away with this. Kay, it-it couldn't have been Millie. I watched her leave before I came back to get you. And Mr. Gant just wouldn't. He's way too cute for that. Okay, now I gotta go but I'm so glad that you're okay. And police are gonna catch whoever did this to you before you even know it, okay? Hm. - Goodnight. - Oh. - Thank you, sweet angel. - Mm. - I love you, guys. - Love you, honey. Love you, too. - And it was a good game. - 'Ha-ha-ha..' - It was. You crushed it. - Yeah. So did you. Okay, text me if you guys need anything. - We will. Thanks, Mon. - I'm here. We will, honey. - Night. - Love you. Honey, have you heard from Jackson? How's he doing? I don't know, I tried to call him after the game but his phone went straight to voicemail. Pizza. Mom, wait. Uh, check the door cam, just-just in case. 'Hi there. Here, you can..' Mom? Mom? Is everything alright? Mom, what? - Great game tonight, Kaley. - It's okay, baby. - It's gonna be okay. - Okay, you, sit down. And you can do the honors. - Mr. Gant, don't do this. - Shut up! You did this, Kaley. You just couldn't keep your mouth shut. Move! Start tying now. There you go. This could have been a whole lot easier if you would just 'stop asking so many questions.' - How did you... - I saw the pizza guy. Paid him off, gave him a big tip for this uniform. Tighter. Now sit down. Sit! - It's okay, baby. - Do not do anything stupid. - Nothing. Either of you. - 'It's okay.' It was you. You killed Clea. Clever girl. Teenage girls at a party. Anything can happen. You really shouldn't have left her alone. Then again, she brought it on herself. I did what had to be done. I protect my family. Clea, what are you doing out here? I mean, everyone's downstairs. Mr. Gant, I just want out. Please, I'll pay you both back. I just want my mom's ring. 'I had no idea it was gonna be like this.' What are you trying to say, Clea? Everyone who took that prep class scored above a 1400. It's impossible, I jumped almost 400 points from my practice tests. Someone clearly doctored our tests. I don't trust the proctor. I-I think he had something to do with it. It's a serious accusation. One that ruins lives. Look, I just want my mother's ring. I just can't do this. Please, I won't say anything. That's okay. Don't worry, Clea. I know you won't say anything. Thank you. I don't got money no I don't need money No I don't need money no I don't got money No I don't need money no I don't need money No I don't need money I don't do well with threats. All I really wanted to do was to scare you. That's it, Kaley. But, apparently, for a smart girl, you can be pretty thick 'cause I tried several times to stop you but you just wouldn't stop digging. - 'I get it. Okay?' - Digging, digging, digging. We want what's best for our kids. But the pressure was too much and i-it probably pushed Millie to cheat. Yeah, that's right, the pressure. Oh, it's intense. But as a parent, I need to protect her. You know, the expectations on these colleges this is ridiculous. - I get it. - No, you do not! And I do not need to hear another word out of your mouth. I gave these kids an edge. - Nat Gevest. - Oh. Hm. That's very good. We heard a lot through your computer, Kaley. Please. I provide a service for the kids who don't have 4.0 and yet they can afford to pay. And you know what they get in return? 'A guarantee that their test score' is gonna be seen by all the colleges. They'll notice. You see there? That's a little win-win for everybody. - Not just you, sweetheart. - They cheated. They rigged the system. No one wins, not even them! Yeah, well, except they didn't know they cheated. See, that's the beauty of it right there. See, Millie thinks that she actually got that score on her own merit, so she owns it. And you know what's actually pretty funny? She didn't do too badly in her junior year, but she needed me and I needed to give her the edge. - How did you do it? - What? I'm just curious about the logistics. - Oh, you're curious? - Yeah. I am. I paid the proctor. Simple, really. Librarians make so little money and I just found someone who was easily manipulated. The kids who took the prep class were on a list which Clark cross-referenced with their licenses. Why? So Clark would easily know which test to replace. 'Well, no one was the wiser.' Oh, would have been perfect if Clea hadn't gotten all worked up about it. I couldn't trust her to shut her mouth so I took every necessary step to protect Millie and I'll protect myself, of course. Then I heard the proctor wanted to talk to you, Kaley so I had to prevent that from happening.. 'cause I am all Millie has and I will never let her down. But unfortunately, you two and that boy just couldn't stay in your lane. So now I have to clean everything up. Hm. I thought planting that test in your locker would just discredit you make you seem bitter if you did find something. But you just would not stop. But I liked you, Kaley, I really liked you. So I thought you were a good influence for my little girl. So I am truly sorry about the horrible kitchen fire that was caused by faulty wiring. That is a huge mistake. - Huh! - Oh! Oh, oh! Get up. Yeah, yeah, that's right. - It is over, Steve. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You're not gonna use that gun. You'll go to great lengths to protect your kid, Steve. Imagine the lengths I'll go to protect mine. Oh, yeah? You're okay, honey? Kaley! Kaley! Kaley! Kaley! I know you won't leave your mother behind. Come on, Kaley. Come on. Just you and me. Just a little chat, that's all. Come on out and play, just for a little bit just a little talk. Just like friends, come on. Just.. There's nowhere for you to go now, Kaley. Kaley! I'm here. Sorry, I couldn't get here sooner. - 'Kaley, honey, I'm okay.' - Mom. Mom. I'm okay. - How did you know? - Door cam. Also, tracked down those photos of the SUV. Turns out, it was registered to Nat Gevest. You came alone? I was already on my way when I hit the panic button. You okay? We're safe. Thank you. 'Guys, come in here, we got 245.' 'Suspect's down, house is secure.' 'Get together. Get together. Come on, picture.' - 'Monica, put your cap on.' - 'No, my bangs!' - I'm sorry. - Oh, you look so good! - Amazing. - 'From studying!' 'Hey, let's get a mom-daughter one.' - 'Jump in there.' - Yeah, come. Oh. Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much when you're at Bentonville. Well, you'll just have to visit then. Both of you. Of course, and we're gonna FaceTime like, three times a week at least. Mom! Keep it together, okay? What? I'm so chill. I'm so chill. Monica, am I not so chill? Oh, yeah, no, she's totally chill. Wait, did you guys hear, Millie got into Oregon-Dobson University. - 'That's great.' - Yeah. Honey, how's she doing? She's with her aunt, right? Yeah. Yeah. Her dad's gonna be in jail for a long time. But, yeah, she had to retake the SATs, she got in. She'll probably play volleyball, so it's good. - That's great. - Yeah. Too bad Bentonville's gonna kick their butts. Oh, wait till you play Duke, baby. Hey, well, I'm still gonna wear my Team Kaley T-shirt. - Oh, and front row center? - Mm-hmm. So jealous that you're going to Alameda Bay. You're gonna get to see Kaley all the time and I'm gonna miss her. Your little young - Aww.. - Yeah, see if you can take.. - Thank you so much. - Oh. Yeah, ready? Two, three. - We did it! - We did it! Your little young girl♪
