Kimura! Um... ...here. What? Are you tired? No, I'm not. Lately you've been busy. Don't push yourself. He'd better push himself! Is the hospital close? 10 minutes away. Yeah? - You should find a better place. - No money! We could help... Smoke outside! Sorry. Thanks. You're going? Sorry for letting you make breakfast. Why? It's totally OK. I got you some new shoes. Shoes? You said yourself that yours are worn out. It's thanks for all your work. Thanks. I'll wear them. Good. I hope you like them. See you. That's some car! Good morning. No, no, no! You really splurged out. A little respect for teachers, please. Hi, Kimura. 'Morning. - Off to work? - Yeah. Perfect. Lend me your car again. No way. You smoked in it. I won't do it again. It'll be fine. There's breakfast upstairs. You have a key? That's nothing short of theft! Take care of Miki, OK? Sure. Put some gas in it! Like that? Yeah. Thanks a... It moved! Yeah? Hey, hey, hey! Why do you have to touch?! Are we through here? - Yes. - Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. You even went shopping. It's OK. I'm on summer vacation. Oh... What time does Kimura get back? If he's working in Yokohama now... He is? You didn't know? He doesn't tell me much. Well, he never wasted words, even in middle school. Unlike me. But he's very conscientious. He better be! Now more than ever we must unite... ...to build a society in which children are free to dream! I, Masayoshi Eto, and the Conservative Party... ...stand for a society... ...in which women dream of marriage and children! That is our mission! A beautiful future for all our children... Hi. AFTER SCHOOL "Smoking is uncool!" I'm sure that's Kimura. She's pretty. Is she young? I couldn't tell. I didn't want to get too close. So I just took this. He's been phoning in sick with a cold. The bastard! When did you take it? Today, in Yokohama. In front of the hotel by head office. Hey... Show me. Maybe he can hook me up. Send me this. I'll talk to him. Don't say I took it. Her, huh? I may be wrong, of course. This "Kimura" works here, but I can't find him. Shall we tell Mr. Kataoka? Idiot! Find the man before Mr. Kataoka finds out. Yes, sir. What about preparations for the meeting? If you're too busy, hire someone. My stomach hurts! Good morning. Good morning. The door will close. "Adult Toys" Well? OK. I don't know how much it'll bring. I'll check with the Taiwan boys. The sooner the better. Hey... The intro costs. Thanks. You're getting into some dangerous work. How much did you lose? Well, you'd better work. You won't pay it off by gambling more. Mr. Kitazawa... Huh? Don't run out on me like that! Who was it? Just some suit. Dumb-ass! They're the worst. What did he want? He's looking for this man. "Resume: Kimura, Kazuki" He's not at that address, and the number's out of service. Did the client leave a name? Nah, just a cell number. He said to call when you find the guy. Did he pay? He'll pay you direct. Straight up. I'd tell you if he'd paid me! Taken today. No? I'll do it. I need the work. See if the guy's school has a website for it's graduates. OK. He's never lived far away. There'll be people who know him. Here you go! What's wrong? You're from Hokkaido... Yes, Sapporo. What's it like? Well, you know... Why? If I moved up there, would you come with me? Sure, Boss. Yeah? Yeah? Jinno! It's coming! It's coming? Hold on! Kimura? Hello? I'm on my Way! Hang on! Hang on! My knee! It's... ...coming! Uh-oh... Careful... careful... - Ow! I can't hold it! - No... no... A baby... Hop in. It hurts! He's not answering! Hey, Kimura! Where are you?! Get to the hospital! The baby's coming! Hang on! I can't! Can I have it here? No, no, no, no! Hang on! Hurry up, will you! Hurry! Huh? She'll be fine now. I've come this far... Congratulations! It's a girl. Which one of you is the father? He's not here yet. Hey, Manabu... Oh, Mr. Kaneko... That was quick. Yeah. You just wanted the hotel lobby, right? I brought VHS and DVD. Thanks a lot. Call me any time. I'm never asleep. "Shimazaki" "Nishi Morisawa Middle School" Congratulations. Thank you. Here's Mommy! Just hold the head like that... And this hand... Good. Wow! There she is! Here we are! Great! Fantastic! Let's get the eyes... Please! I don't have any make-up on! Jinno... thanks. For what? Where's Kimura? Still at work? Then he would've phoned. Maybe he went off with... No. But at a time like this! It's all right. He's... There's no one as responsible as he is. I guarantee you. I'll go get a drink. - Get me a milk. - OK. I'm completely happy. Now I have her... ...I don't need anything else. Oh, come on! Sorry. I'm all sentimental. Right, I'd better go. I've got practice. You're OK? Yeah. I'll go straight there. Tell Kimura to phone me. 'Bye. I'll drive you. Are you still here? Yes. Kimura? Not here. Watch the front and back doors, for now. Um... Excuse me. Would Mr. Osawa be here? Mr. Osawa's retired. What! He is? Yes. What about Mr. Inoue? He teaches at another school now. Are you a graduate? Yes. Aw, man! I'm trying to get in touch with an old classmate... ...but I lost my yearbook. They're all in the library. What year did you graduate? - 1990. - Is that right? Come to think of it, Mr. Jinno was in that class. - "Mr. Jinno"? - Yeah. What's your name? Shimazaki. - Mr. Jinno! - Yes? Mr. Shimazaki, an old classmate. Yeah? "Shimazaki"... Sorry. I can't bring you to mind. Yeah... We can't have talked much in middle school. No, I don't think we ever did. Not once. There were so many of us then. We had 11 classes in our year. Now we're down to four. Takes you back, huh? It sure does. Are you married? No. You? Nope. Free as a bird. Who do you want to find? One of the girls? Do you remember Kazuki Kimura? Kimura? Do you see him? Yeah. Huh? Did you hang out with him? No. The place he works, uh... Kajiyama Co.? Yeah, that's it. He works near me. I see him sometimes. Oh. You'll probably find him at the hospital today. The hospital? The baby came today. Baby? He didn't tell you? It's been a few years since I saw him... Oh. Did you know Ms. Sano? "Sano"? Miki Sano. Remember? Oh... kind of. She's a mother now. Do you have a car? To go there? Yeah. So Kimura took your car to work and hasn't come back? Yeah. Look, there's the old shoe-shelf, "love-letter heaven". In our day we gave letters to people we liked. Now it's all email. Oh. About Kimura... Morishita! Ten figure-of-eights, and ten hill sprints! Go comb your hair! Who?! Get busy! Kimura had a way with women... You know... the girls always liked him, didn't they. I guess so. My little sister would change clothes every time he came over. - Really? - As if she's going out. Hey! Now I remember! What? You wrote my sister a love letter in middle school, didn't you? That's it! That's why I knew the name! I did? Sorry about that, but it was years ago, right? She's still single, you know. How about it? Take her out. She's a cop, and she's as serious as they come. - I'll call her... - No, thanks. I'm involved. Oh. Is she young? What do you do for work? Me? A toy store. A toy store? Hello? Have you found Kimura? Not yet. Tell me now if you can. We're short of time. I have a clue. But you haven't paid. I'd like half up front. I'll come at 11, then. Connecting to message service. No luck. He still isn't back. This van smells like a chemistry lab. What do you want with Kimura? What? What's this? Is that your car? That's from yesterday, at a hotel in Yokohama. But he's not there any more. I checked yesterday. What's this about? Has Kimura said anything about a woman? Who took this? I don't know. Help me out, OK? There's not much time. This is no ordinary toy store. Are you closed today? My assistant took off. Put that on. Why? That way you won't stick out so much. Tell me what's going on. You sell toys and you're a detective? Hey! - What's this? - Take a picture. There's no "click". Point it and pretend you're talking. Ever tail anyone? Of course not. It's hard to do alone. Just follow this guy as best you can. Photograph anyone he meets. I can track you from here using that phone. Just ask who he is! My customers don't tell me that. What is this place? Wait out front. A hidden door? - Tell me if Kimura calls. - Hey, wait! My fee... ...is this, plus expenses. I'll use any means I can. Be prepared for that. The rest when you find him. Fine. The woman... You found her? Is she with him? I don't know. Anyhow, just find Kimura. Today, if you can. I study palmistry. May I? Your line of destiny is very thick... I'll stay with him. Sorry. I'm tailing someone. A bowling alley? Wait a little, then follow him in. No luck yet. Can we trust that "Kitazawa"? I met him in a gambling den. He's done one job for me. Some guy was hitting on my wife. Kitazawa taught him a lesson. He works fast. But he's charging an arm and a leg. If we're wrong about Kimura... You know how I stay in business? I'm the world's biggest coward. Everything worries me, no matter how small. I don't mind spending money to ease my mind. That's what gets me nice shoes like these. But what if he suspects something? Just pay him off the moment he finds Kimura. He's in business. He won't do extra digging for free. Switch it to TV phone and get in closer. Hey, hey, it's me! I'm at the bowling alley. I thought I'd call. Yeah... Yeah? That's funny! Well, well, well! "Kajiyama Co. Ltd. Takeshi Oguro, President" The bowling alley, I told you! Yeah... I'm about to pick up a ball and bowl it. Sure! That's funny! Yeah... It's hard to find a good one. Yeah. Funny, huh? You want that? No. Mr. Kataoka? Who are you? Hello? Yo, Kitazawa. Mr. Kataoka?! I hear you're going to Sapporo. You don't seem to have much respect for me. That's not true! Get your ass over here. You don't drop out of sight when you owe me money! Hello? Go down that street. I'll pick you up. What? Bring my clothes! Hey, what's the matter? Shimazaki! Anyway... let's find Kimura. What did you find out? Does he deal with yakuza? Yakuza? Why would he deal with gangsters? It looks like his company does. Kajiyama Co.? They're blue-chip! Oguro, the president of Kajiyama. I did a job for him once. Look. They're tied to Kataoka. Who? A yakuza don. Do they want Kimura? No. If Kataoka wanted him, he'd ask me directly. Why? I'd work free. Shimazaki, tell me what's going on! There hasn't been anything? No talk of a woman, or anything strange? No. He's the same old Kimura. So what's he like? What's he like? Serious, a nice guy... He hasn't changed. He hasn't? How do you know? How? I know, that's why. Because you're friends? Yeah. What's so funny? "Vote Masatoshi Eto!" Why are we stopping here? Information. What are those? The old guy in there likes little girls. Want one? They're great. Very illegal. Idiot! I'm a teacher! So what? Hey... That's 260 yen for the food. Wait here. Sorry, I'm not open yet. I need to ask you something. I don't know anything. These are wild. Domestic or foreign? Both. You're going to Sapporo? Kataoka's looking for you. Don't worry. I won't sell you out. It's about Kataoka. Have you heard anything? The woman? Woman? Well, I've heard he's looking for a certain woman. Name of Ayumi. She worked at a place he runs called "Heaven". She took off. "Ayumi? If he's looking for someone, why didn't he call me? He doesn't want it known... ...he's all broken up about a woman leaving him. He'd lose face. I heard he quietly hired a legit detective... ...but not that he'd found her. What? Nothing. Is that all? That's all. What about Kajiyama Co.? Kajiyama Co.? No, I haven't heard anything about them. But you know... ...the Kajiyama Co. Is a big customer at Heaven. Their guys go there a lot... ...and spend money like water. They do, huh? What? You look like you smell money. No... But tell me more about Heaven, though. I can ask around if you like. Please. Yes? I'm here. OK. The Shanghai people have arrived at their hotel in Tokyo. They have? I'll be here 'till tomorrow. Order me a massage and a girl. Yes, sir. Can you hear? Say something. What is this place? I want to talk to a girl there. Then why don't you? I can't be seen around here. Just say what I tell you. Say what? Hello. First time? "No. Is Meg here?" No. Is Meg here? Yep. What course? "The Superbowl." The Superbowl. Take your DVD and go in there. MY DVD? Take a DVD into the cubicle. Just grab one! There's no girl here. She's coming. She might know the girl in the picture. Come again? Look in the bag. That's so she'll talk. She might not want to, so say what I tell you. This takes technique. Listen up. I'll feed you your lines. When we get to... Hello. What about your DVD? "I'd rather talk." I'd rather talk. OK. If I may... Huh? What?! - First time? - It's OK! It's the Superbowl! No, stop! - Don't stop! - Don't stop! No, stop! Look, I'd like to ask you something. Do you know this woman? Idiot! That's Ayumi. You found her? Well... You're a detective, too? "There've been others?" There've been others? I don't know anything. I quit Heaven ages ago. You knew her well? Not even her real name. We both grew up with fathers in debt, so we had something in common. Anyway, she disappeared one rainy night. A rainy night? Yes. That's all I know. Show the money. Hold onto it. “Do you remember anything else?“ Now you mention it, there was a customer she liked. Show her Kimura. "Kimura", from... ...Kajiyama Co. He was there the night she disappeared. It's like their eyes met for a second. I never miss that. Hello? Is that Kimura? Yes... Towed?! That's some car. Do teachers make that much? I took out a loan. After 2 am... And not far away. Let's go. "Towed to Okura Police Station" - Hey! That's not yours. - Just a sec. The battery's dead. Hey! Hey... Where are your manners? - Give me that. - No. - Give it here! - What's the problem!? Gimme it! How would you like it? What? You think he's up there? He might be. Or he's left the country. Huh? Does Kimura have money? Money? A woman wouldn't take off with him if he didn't. "Take off"? Well, it's just a theory. But one thing's for sure, he was in that apartment last night. 11:06 pm. Up to the 4th floor. Lots of guys cheat on pregnant wives. He's... Not like that? Too bad, Teacher. That's reality for you. You learning? You don't know Kimura. Do you? And anyway... ...now you might get his wife. I'm sure you wanted to. Now's your chance. She'll be lonely now. A yummy mummy. What's wrong, angry? What happened to you? You can't have always been like this. What do you know about people from living in a classroom? Knowing nothing, seeing the world how you want to... ...all safe and secure. Guys like you piss me off. It's time to graduate from middle school. What? Whatever. No problem at all, Mr. Eto. Hello? - Consider it taken care of, Mr. Eto. - 'Evening. You found him? More or less. - Where? - First, let me ask you... ...if I found the girl with him... ...would I get paid for her? Or I could phone Mr. Kataoka directly myself... ...and tell him Ayumi's with one of your staff. What do you mean? Isn't Mr. Kataoka important to your company? It wouldn't be good for business if an employee of yours... ...laid hands on her. I don't understand. I don't really care how we handle it. It's just that I owe Mr. Kataoka. Damn you! Could you bring over the extra fee, please? Just you. I'm a bit tied up. Hi. What are you two up to? I thought you went to Yokohama. I did. I checked the president's schedule. As I thought, it's definitely tomorrow. He'll come carrying a lot of money. Alone. Oh, yeah... We stopped on the way back for a cup of tea... ...and I got towed. My cell phone was in the car. All night? No. Well, she made me some pancakes... ...so I stayed awhile. Why didn't you get the car? I don't have any demerit points, so I figured I'd get you to go. But you weren't here, so I crashed out. A private detective brought that. I've been with him all day. Now I know all about you two. A detective? He's watching the apartment. - She's at the hotel, right? - No, she left. She's been seen there too much. Tomorrow I go alone. Then call her, since you're such good friends. Oh, shit! That detective still doesn't know about tomorrow. We only need till then. You won't be at work... This isn't mine. Hey, Kimura! Where are you?! Get to the hospital! The baby's coming! 11:05 am on the 20th. Someone took a picture of you. A detective came to my school. He's looking for you! I'm with him right now. Anyhow, I'll try to find out what's going on. Are you listening? Email me. Hi... I study palmistry. May I? Your line of destiny is very thick... Anyway, I'll stay with him. Now what?! I've been working on this for weeks! Yo, Kitazawa. I hear you found Ayumi. The detective's gone. Are you ready? What's going on? What's going on? Why call Kataoka? We had to tell him our relationship has been revealed. You do what I tell you! I'm the one on the hook. You told me to hire that detective. He's your fault, right? But don't worry. I can step in for you any time. There's someone more important than Kataoka. Hey... Hello? Excuse me, sir. It's Kimura from Accounts. You! I'm sorry to call so late, but I'm in need of money. - And? - Well, there's some things... "about the company I'd like to discuss. About the meeting you have at head office tomorrow. I have some documents for you. I don't follow. No? In that case, I believe the police are still working at this time. I don't mind either way, but you'll be held responsible. Do you want that? What do you want? Leave the hotel without anyone seeing you. Let's have some noodles. And I'd like to borrow a little money, too. These documents... do they really exist? Well... ...I can't say for sure that they don't. I'm sorry. That girl Ayumi... - Yes... - She knows... ...that you're doing our work for us. I told her. A long time ago, in bed. So she knows... ...how you bring suitcases of money out of that hotel. She had her eye on that money. However she'd have to find out... ...when you'd be there with it. And the best way to do that was to hook up with one of your staff. - Sir... - So... ...this is your fault. Your staff training is poor. Yes. You realize how much it'll cost to put everything off? Yes. I'm sorry. Anyhow, go get those documents. We'll take care of the rest. - OK. - Get going! Yeah? What? You can't get into the building? Hi... ...Teacher. Surprised? No. I never trusted teachers anyway. You can forget about the woman. "Suginoya Noodle Restaurant" Welcome. What a thing to do! I bought her that dress. So it's true? You were her... Yeah. Her patron. She got into debt with us. She was pretty, so we put her to work. She was a good earner, the most popular girl we had. Her debt had been paid off long ago... She kept me in pocket money... ...so I pumped up her debt to keep her around. She got pregnant. I gave her the money to get rid of it. I thought that's why she took off... ...but I guess not. Women can hurt you. What? Let's move you out of here. Hey... Yes? Find that teacher and bring him to me. I'm just putting off my beef with you for a little while, though. Yes, sir. Will this table do? The man hasn't come yet. OK. Welcome. Thanks for coming. He's there. Huh? How did he get in? Don't know. To think I have an idiot on my staff! How about a beer? What do you have for me? Let's have some beer first. You must be thirsty, right? Was it Ayumi who had that baby? Look, the truth is, I'd like to ask you something. Do you know this woman? Idiot! That's Ayumi. I was proud of that idea. You knew from the start I wasn't Shimazaki? No. I thought you were, till you showed me that picture. It's just... I said that Shimazaki was in love with my sister, right? He never would have missed her in a picture that clear. Miki! You had a girl? - Yeah. - She's so sweet! You're bleeding. Oh, this? It's hard to wash off. I just died, in your place. Pardon? I killed... ...Ayumi. When did you meet Kataoka's girl? About six months ago. Eh? Good evening. We'll be off, then. Thanks. Bye. See you. Give it here. What? Here's the money. Open it if you want. I don't know why... ...but you're messing with the yakuza. We're not doing anything. The ones messing with the yakuza are the police. The police. Will that be all? Thank you. There were tons of detectives... "watching the hotel beside Kajiyama Co. By messing up the deal, you caused all kinds of trouble. I'll bring you some more tea. Thank you. When I... ...hooked up with you and this happened, they were furious. With me. The police... They're intimidating. I mean, I didn't even start it. It was those two. Give me a break, will you? I'm not your driver. Take a taxi! I just saw Miki Sano in that club. Miki Sano? You're kidding! It looks like she works there. Did you talk to her? No. I called to her, but... I need some help. Let's move. - Not again! Hang on... - Come on. Hurry! Damn this car! I definitely need a new one! There! Anyhow, she was in trouble, so I talked to my sister. Then... ...while the police were questioning Ms. Sano... "Kajiyama Co. and the yakuza kinda came up. Suddenly she became very important. And so... ...they asked Kimura to check out his company... ...and Ms. Sano had a police guard from that day on. Hey! About your meeting tomorrow with those Shanghai businessmen... What are they bringing? Drugs or something? You've sure got nerve. Doing yakuza work at the office in broad daylight! Say something! Enough. Give it to him. But Kimura looked for six months, and couldn't find anything. The president is very careful. So for the police, that meeting... - ...was their golden opportunity. - Ow! That's hot! With the police there, I'll never find her. She's staying at my place. Me and Kimura took a place close by. Give me my cell phone. It's expensive. Your phone... You're Kitazawa? Be more careful where you park. What's going on? Excuse me! Another jambalaya. Aren't you going? Oh... You go ahead, sir. I heard about that woman being seen around the hotel recently. I thought she was a cop. When I saw the picture of you and her... ...I thought you were a police rat. I never dreamed a yakuza moll was using you. How did she get you into this? She asked for help. And? I said yes. You're a fool. Kataoka's here. Wait till Oguro leaves. Yo. Know who I am? Oguro's gone. Right, call them. Don't be so nervous. I admire your spunk... Good night. Huh? Hey... Ouch! Ow! Mr. Nishimura! Yo. They're not interested in you. They're another section. We're just helping out. They're not after gangsters. Thanks for coming out. I looked good out there, huh? Not really. Oh. Thanks for coming out. You, too. Here he comes. "Spot Check" Excuse me... Eh? You smell of alcohol, you know. Step out of the car, please. Huh? What's that? Show me. "The Shadow Wanker" What's this? What a day, huh? You get born, then taken straight to school... My brother's been going crazy, hasn't he? I wonder what I should do... About what? You've all done so much... I don't want to cause more trouble. Just be happy. With her. Hey... What do you gain from helping her? Gain? What's so great about being a police poodle? Every class has a kid like you. A know-it-all, who mocks everything... ...always bored with school... It's not the school, you know. What's boring... is you. What was in the envelope I gave him? You don't need to know. At any rate, there's enough there to scare the pants off him. He'll spill everything. At last we've got a break. This'll be great! It will? And I have to find a job. Anyway, thanks for everything... Men, let's move it! Yes, sir. Oh... ...can we leave Miki Sano in your hands? Sure. That'll be... ...Jinno. Kimura! Um... ...here. Could you give that to Jinno? Oh, to Jinno... Yeah. OK. Thanks. We're moving away. Take care. It's been so long! When I got that letter... ...I looked for you after school, but you were gone. Sorry. I left early that day. We were basically skipping town. I didn't tell any of my friends. "I'll walk you home." I looked all over. My heart was in my mouth... ...wanting to say that. You haven't changed. Have you? Let's go home. To my place. Together. What's Mr. Jinno doing here with a woman? - Oh, you're right! - You guys are early! OK, get inside. - Who's is she? - She's pretty! Go inside, will you? Go practice your swing! Who she is doesn't concern you. Constable, did Kimura stay with you last night? - No. - Did he try? Kimura's not like that. Good work. Thanks. Just two more days, huh? I wonder what my brother's up to. "Up to"? With Miki. Oh. He's made up his mind. There's a ring in the car. I found it. I thought he was just being tight lately, but he's got two loans. I see... I'm the go-between again. What? Are you in love, too? No... Well, you know... I had a crush on her. I certainly don't dislike her. And she can cook. Don't tell Jinno. That's terrible! Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. No. Of course your not. - Come upstairs. - No, no... - Eat something sweet. - Why? You do that when you're sad. I've never heard that, but OK. - What would you like? - Uh, pancakes. You poor guy! You saying that makes me feel like maybe I am. You've tried so hard, haven't you? Yeah, I have. That's so sad! Still, she did buy me some shoes. Oh... Isn't that nice!
