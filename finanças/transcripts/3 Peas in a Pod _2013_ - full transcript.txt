Do you know my name means "rock"? Who would name their son after some rock? Why would anyone name their daughter after some coin? And the least valuable one, too. If an "S" is added at the end, it becomes a homonym, you know-- Shut up, okay? Hey, what you fighting about? -Nothing. -Nothing. Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. Gorgeous. Remarkable. I'm nothing special. I'm just an ordinary girl. Hey. How ya going? Good! How are you? Good, thanks! The test results. Okay. No problem. I'll just wait for the printout. Are you going away for the holidays? If I flunk this, I'm going back to Singapore. I'm sure you'll do well. Thank you. I'll just get the printout for you. Okay, don't show me! Okay, I'm sure they'll be good. Thank you. -Your card. -Thanks so much. -Have a good day! -See you. Bye. Hello! Mummy! I don't have to go back to Singapore! My results are excellent! Really! And then... Those are my results. I don't know what you're up to. I'm on the phone to Singapore. But those are my results. Mummy. I'll call you back later. Okay, bye-bye. Look, I don't know what you're talking about, I already have a boyfriend. And these are clearly my... Your surname is "Yang," too? Is that a problem? My father's surname is "Yang," too. Why didn't you speak Mandarin earlier? White imposter. The pot calling the kettle black. It was love at first sight for Perry. But... the person that I like... is him. That's Peter Park. He's the son of a Korean hotel-chain magnate. God is so unfair. Not only is Peter ultrarich, but he's also incredibly handsome. I'm not sure why, but Peter always looks like he walked out of a K-pop music video. No matter their race or nationality, once a girl sees him, she's irresistibly drawn to him. But... Peter doesn't care about anyone but me. Peter only likes to hang out with me. I think... he might be secretly in love with me, too. So, how did you do? All right, that's just my fantasy. Peter and I are like brothers. We became fast friends after we met during student orientation. Actually... I'm not sure why we became buddies. Perhaps it's because... I'm always helping him. For example, I attend his classes for him... take notes for him... and occasionally... I do his assignments for him. I offer him my shoulder to cry on when he's sad. Peter is always sad. I'm not sure why, because he never says anything. Besides me, no one in school has seen Peter cry. I'm used to it by now, but every time I see Peter cry... I still feel sorry for him. Now that Perry's there, he can share half my responsibilities. Now Perry has also seen Peter cry. Actually, Perry is just like me. Because when he likes someone, he'll do things that he otherwise wouldn't. But why did Peter choose me to be his BFF? I'm not sure. And why do I hang out with Perry? I'm not sure, either. Anyway, the three of us hung out all the time and became best friends. Everyone calls us the "3 Peas." Actually, white people don't know the real meaning of "3P" in Chinese. But the three of us don't resemble that meaning. Actually, we have nothing in common except that our names start with 'P.' We all have very different personalities. Perry's family in Taiwan isn't well-off. He obtained a scholarship from some company to study in Australia. Peter doesn't care about his studies. He's going to take over his dad's business in Korea anyway. Me... I'm just an average Singaporean girl. Besides Peter, I don't have a clue what I like. And that's how we ended up spending a good four years together. Four years of university life flew by. If though we never said it, we weren't looking forward to going our separate ways. Hey! We're graduating soon. Will you miss me after we go back to our respective countries? Yes, I will... miss you doing stuff for me. Speak English! Perry's just asking if you're going to miss me after graduation. Yeah, I'll miss you doing my homework for me. Look, I'm just kidding. You know I don't really want to go back to Korea. I'm dreading it, actually. Well, at least you have a wife there waiting for you. That's why I'm dreading it. I remember she's pretty hot. Let's see the photo again. Hey, stop it! She's hot! I would do her. You can have her, then. Can't even remember her name. Choi Ji-woo? Jang Nara? Or Boa? Very funny. Yeah, stop it! What about you? Hey! Always looking at it. Bet there's a lot of pretty Taiwanese girls' pictures inside. No password? Sorry. What are you so secretive about, anyway? Even though we've known you for so long, we hardly even know you. Speak English! I was just saying Perry's so secretive. We hardly even know him even though we've known him for so long. You're right! And that's why we need to take a trip after graduation! A bonding trip! You know, we never go anywhere together. We go everywhere together. No, but this will be a road trip where we'll be together 24/7 and really get to know each other. Including the secretive Perry. I don't know. I got to go back to Taiwan straight away after graduation. You know I'm on a scholarship, right? I already have a job waiting for me. I didn't do too well on my exams. My parents probably won't think I deserve a trip. Come on, guys! This could be the last time we actually hang out together as the 3 Peas! Well, I guess I can write to them and say I will start work later. They love me, anyway. My results are excellent. Great! And you? I guess I can tell them that I won it in a lucky draw. They're Singaporeans, they'll think it's a waste not to go. It's a waste not to go. Well... indeed, you have won a trip! Park, Sr. will pay for this. Look, you know I really am not looking forward to going back. Everything is planned for me. My life. My work. My wife. Let's just have some fun before I lose my freedom forever, okay? Just grant me that. Okay. On one condition. I plan the trip. You'll have to. The two of us suck at planning anyway. Hey! I don't! I just... haven't really found something I want to plan for. Yeah, right! One thing, though. I got to have my own room, okay? I've never shared a room with anyone in my life. Don't worry. I won't let you sleep with him. I'll pay for all three rooms. Oh, my God! What an exciting trip we're going to have! To the 3 Peas Road Trip! Hey, it's bad luck to toast with water. And I have no more coffee in my cup. Gross! To the 3 Peas Road Trip! Come on! To the 3 Peas Road Trip! Who could have guessed what a life-changing road trip this would turn out to be? What are you doing? I'm booking the rooms. Your K-pop star wants three rooms. I have to book them before they run out. And there's your key. Have a wonderful trip! Thank you! I don't like this car. Why? Yeah, it's hardy, practical, and very suitable for our long drive. Yeah, but it's boring. I want a sexy car like what we see in road-trip movies. Do you have a Cadillac or something with an open top? Come on, guys! It's a freaking road trip! Look, I'm sorry, I know this is kind of last minute, but do you have a sexy car? Well, we do have a very beautiful car. We call it "The Car." But I've got to tell you, kids... it's going to cost you twice as much as this one. Well, let's see it. This is a beautiful, classic Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible in Athenian blue with contrasting beige hide. It's a remarkable and luxurious car for road trips. We'll take it! If you love taking pictures so much, why don't you get yourself a camera? This phone can take really good pictures. I don't need a camera. And I can store a lot of pictures on this phone. It's portable and convenient. You really are very thrifty. Yeah... Speak English! You have so many part-time jobs. And you have a well-paying job waiting for you back in Taiwan. Why don't you just buy yourself a proper camera? You never know about the future. And it's always better to save for a rainy day. My dad would love for you to be his son. Sure. Can he adopt me? I'm pretty sure he'll prefer you to me as his son. You want to marry Boa? If I can be your dad's son, I will even marry Dae Jang-geum. Then maybe I'll really consider buying that camera. Hey! What about me? You want to marry Dae Jung-geum? -I thought you wanted to marry me! -What? You want her to marry you, so she can continue doing your work for you in Korea. Well, then I think you'll have to come, too. To help her do my work for me. I'm not sure why, but I often have recurring images of this moment. Every detail remains vivid in my memories. Perry's silly jokes, Peter's carefree demeanor... Whenever I recall this moment, I feel very happy. Three university students sitting in a Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible... driving along Great Ocean Road, without a care in the world. Whatever happens is in the future. We are living in the now. If I could stop time, I'd choose to live in this moment forever. Because I think this might be... the happiest time of my life. That's impossible. I remember booking three rooms. It is a booking under Mr. Yang, right? That's correct. I booked three single rooms. Nope. It says here only one room, and we're fully booked today. Look, I have the money. Can I pay double whatever you're charging? Hey, this is not your dad's hotel. Yeah, well, obviously not. If it were, we would be escorted to our suites now. Separate suites. Look, I'm sorry. It's obviously my mistake. Let's just make do with this one room. After all, we're only staying a night. We'll take it. Don't be so angry. I think it's inappropriate for you to sleep in the middle. Why not? It's just inappropriate. Then what do you want? Let's switch places. Do you think I want to switch with you? Hey, shouldn't girls have a little modesty? You come over here. Perry Yang! What? What was that I felt? What was what? Oh, please. I think you're the one that I should be wary of. Go to sleep! You're really scary, you know that? Get up. We have a lot of places to visit today. Go wash up. Do you know that you're just like my mom? Really? Is your mom as good-looking as me? You're not as good-looking as he is. I don't disagree. Get up! Should I be with the one who loves me... or with the one I love? What the heck, they didn't even say they loved me. What are we having? He's having two egg whites, scrambled, with toast, wholemeal, grilled tomatoes and fruit. And a glass of milk. She's having pancakes with maple syrup on the side, and an English breakfast tea. Right! What you having? I'll just have a yogurt and a coffee. Thanks. Okay. Peter! One, two, three. Nice. Looking good. You're looking good. Why aren't you joining us? No, thanks. I'm afraid of the cold. Don't be a spoilsport. We're already here. Yeah, come on. We came all the way here. -Come! -Come on! Come on. Faster! Come on! All right! Are you for real? I never see you work out and you have such a nice body? You really are secretive, aren't you? I only started working out recently. Recently, and your body looks like that? Did it for you. Like it? How much further? I can't walk anymore. Come on! You can do it. Just one more kilometer! Doesn't feel like it! That's because we're on a gradient and it's the altitude. Okay. Okay? Hurry up, you two! Before we lose the light! What did you have for breakfast? Why are you so heavy? I didn't eat much! Just the usual. You're lying! -Why do you keep calling me fat? -You've put on weight recently. Crazy, isn't it? Is this what the world looked like thousands of years ago? Well, not in Singapore. It's a tropical country. More rainforests and fewer terrains. Do you think this is what heaven looks like? Depends on your religion, I guess. They have different forms of heaven. If you're Christian, there must be a white light, plus some cherub angels playing harps. Do you know the two of you are my bestest friends? In the face of such splendor... I guess anyone would feel insignificant. Okay. Penny gets the single bed. That's obvious enough. It's okay. I'll call the reception and ask for an extra cot or mattress. This is a call from room 136. Do you have an extra cot or mattress? No? Okay. They've run out. Why did we even put you in charge of booking the room? I said three rooms! Hey, it's just for one night. I'm sorry. I'll take the floor. Well, I'm the skinniest, so I can share the bed with one of you, the other one can take the other bed. -No! -No! Okay, whatever. You're lucky we're both pretty lean. Hey! Switch places with me. If I go over, don't even think about coming here. Both of you can continue to squeeze like sardines, then. You'd rather be uncomfortable than let me be with him. You're so selfish. A girl's lips are the sexiest. Here, let me help you put on some lip balm. -No, thanks! -Okay, forget it, then. I'll help you style your hair. A pretty girl should have long straight hair. This is what I'll do to your hair. Why do you always make fun of me? Okay. So, this is where we kept our wines over a hundred years ago. These are what we call "the drives." We have a three-kilometer labyrinth of tunnels here. So, don't go wandering off, or you might not find your way out again. That's Emily. Don't worry about her. She's all right. In fact, she is just about to be married to one of the richest landowners in Western Victoria, arranged by her father. And looks to me like she needs a bit of a bath. Look, how long is this tour? It's getting a little stuffy down here. Well... We are almost done. So, then we'll head up for some wine tasting, okay? Come on. Yeah, follow me. This is our barrel chapel, where couples can hold their wedding ceremonies in a unique, rustic and romantic ambience. Can three people get married to each other here? Well... I'm not sure if that's quite allowed or even... recognized here in the state of Victoria, or in Australia, or... anywhere in the world, for that matter. But... we are very open here. We've had an interracial wedding and even a gay marriage. But if you want to have a party for your friends to celebrate the three of you graduating, then that is fine with us. Now, I think it's time for a drink! To the Drives Café for some wine tasting. All right, follow me. What's wrong with you? Have you taken your meds? By the way, it's "get married to one another" if it's more than two people. "Each other" is only reserved for two. Didn't your elementary English teacher teach you that in Korea? Let's go! Seppelt Fleur de Lys Vintage is an elegantly refined sparkling wine which has won 90 medals out of its last three vintages. -Would you like to try? -No, she doesn't drink. -Yes, she does. -I'll have it. I think it's supposed to be called "wine tasting." Well, I think you like that one. So, how about this one? Our Seppelt specialty St. Peters Grampians Shiraz. St. Peters? I must have it, then. Really good! I'll love to try all your wines here. Now, what? What do you mean? I've never seen him so drunk before. The last time he was that drunk was when Lisa broke up with him. Hold on, Lisa! You don't care about anyone but yourself! He was never in love with Lisa. How do you know? Of course I know. He doesn't like white people. He only dated a white girl to spite his father. Fine! Do what you want! He got drunk the other time because his father called him. But, Dad, I really don't want to do it No... But I told you the other time, didn't I? Dad, can't you try to understand? Dad! Hello? Dad! How do you know? I know everything about you. Your everything includes his everything. So, naturally, I know everything about him. Okay, you get some rest. I'll take care of him. I can take care of him, too. You've taken care of him for long enough. I'll take care of him tonight. Dig in. So, what's for breakfast? Hey, you're up! Yes, and very hungry! Waitress! You can serve the eggs now, without the yolks. Thank you. Wait. I think I'll have some yolks this morning. Yes, hi. Can I have two eggs sunny side up, with yolks runny, but whites fully cooked, with bacon, sausages and a side of baked beans. Thank you. After all that drinking yesterday, I think I'll need some trans fat and cholesterol to fight the hangover. What? I'm hungry! I got you a present. I bought it at the store yesterday. I want to tie you down. Thanks. Boy, I'm hungry. So, where are we going today? We're going to see some fat, lazy buggers. What's the matter with you? What do you mean? I have no idea what's going on, either. Isn't this what you've always wanted? Love... is so complicated. Without romance... life would be so simple. I wonder if seals know anything about love. Hey, I got this for you. I got one for you, too. He's never given me anything in the past four years. But today, I received not one but two presents from him. I have one, too. How do you know what I'm thinking about? How could I not know? Talking bad about me again? We wouldn't dare. This is for you. It's got orange vodka, Chambord raspberry liqueur and cranberry juice. It's called "the Love Potion." And I got you a Zombie. What did you get yourself? Sneaky Pete. It's got milk in it, it's healthy! Thanks for coming to see The Good China, everybody. Hope you're having a fantastic night. All right, tonight we've had a bit of a request. I would like to invite up on the stage Perry, who is going to sing a love song for that special someone. You and I If we could be together You and I If there were love We would be like two stars in the sky Giving each other strength And creating eternal beauty In the Milky Way There would be infinite bliss As we would be happy and free You and I Will continue our lives together You and I It doesn't even matter if there's no love You revolve around the sun I'm not as powerful as the sun But I will always give you light Even though I can only provide A bit of comfort in the night I will continue to revolve around you You and I We're just like the Earth and the moon Even though we can never get closer And I can only appear in the night My heart will forever belong with you You and I If we could be together You and I If there were love That was good. Never knew you were so musically inclined. There are lots of things you don't know about me. You never tell us. Well, you never asked. All right, it's never too late to ask. Let's play Truth or Dare! How about it? Who's in? I am! Sure. Sweet! We shall start with Perry, then. Truth or dare? Dare. Come on. -All right. Truth. -Sweet. How many relationships have you had before? None. Are you in love with someone now? That's two questions. Your turn now. -Truth or dare? -Truth. When was the last time you were truly happy? When I was 12, maybe. Guys... this is our farewell road trip! It's a freaking holiday! Can we just try to enjoy ourselves? Okay. Your turn, then. Truth or Dare? Dare? Truth. Who do you love? My mom. Given a choice, would you choose him or me? Right, this is so fair. Can I please have the chance to participate in this game? Weren't we part of the same race 3,000 years ago? More like 5,000, actually. Whatever. This game is no fun. Let's just drink up! I'm going to get another Zombie. Perry might wake up. Don't worry. He's had too many Zombies. He's as dead as one now. What's wrong? Penny! You've never liked me. What? You tell me what. Do you even like me? I don't even know what I like. Or what I want. I'm screwed up. Sorry. Look... if you don't like your arranged marriage with your arranged wife, just tell your father. If you don't want to work for him, just tell him. What are you so afraid of? Stop being so unhappy all the time! You'll never understand. You're right. I don't. I don't understand why you'd want to be nicer to me just because you see Perry being nicer to me. Do you... really care about me? Or is it just because you always want things that you cannot have? But when you know that you can have them, you just don't freaking want them anymore! I don't understand why you're so unhappy all the time. You have everything. You're rich. You're smart. You're good-looking. You have everything! Why do you have to keep taking those pills? Do they really make you happier? Just... get a life! I'm begging you! Did I go too far? Come on, wake up, sleepyheads! We got to go now, before it's too late! Come on... It's only 4:30 a.m. Where are we going? You'll know in a minute. But you got to hurry! You won't want to miss it! Let's go, okay? Come on, you two! Nice, isn't it? You know, I used to hate sunrises. When I was little, my dad used to wake me up at 5:00 a.m. during weekdays., just before going to school. And drag me up the hill near our house to see the sunrise. I would be so tired. And that's the only time I would see him the whole day. He said that was my bonding time with him. He always said... That's "seize the day" in Korean. He's so afraid of wasting time. Everything he does has to be productive and constructive. He said climbing the hill was good exercise, and we should make good use of what nature gives us, and sunrises are free. Your dad is a cheapskate. What are the sunrises in your countries like? Don't think I've ever noticed. In Singapore... students wake up really early in the morning. And they're on the school bus before the sun rises. We try to sleep in on weekends. I live in Taipei. It's a very busy city. There's never time to catch the sunrise. I guess I'm lucky, then. All right. Carpe diem! Seize the day, guys! Come on, let's go get some breakfast! Come on, hurry! Did I really say the right thing to him? What does it say? "My dear father, you have planned my life for 22 years. Please stop. Screw you!" Okay, not the "Screw you," but something along those lines. Well, what are you waiting for? Send it! Yeah! Nice one! All right, let's go out for a celebration. Let's go! Wait for me! He forgot his mug. He's going to have the scrambled eggs, and-- And she's going to have pancakes with maple syrup. And a cup of English breakfast tea. And he will have yogurt and a cup of coffee. Peter really changed for the better. Thank you. He's happier now. He used to be really self-centered. But now, he's more caring and sensitive towards others' feelings. Despite how long I'd known Peter, I'd never seen him laugh so whole-heartedly. Perry and I are happy for him. I guess that's what real friends are like. Seeing our friend happy makes us happy, too. Hey, your camera. You can have it. No, come on. I have a job now, I can afford my own camera. Well... I really won't be needing it anymore. Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life. This is the last day of our four years together. Someone's leaving us tomorrow. Any last words for him? Don't use the word "leave." You should say "depart." Then we might as well say "apart." Yeah! Speak English! Perry's just asking if you're going to miss me after you go back to Korea. No, he didn't. You understand Chinese now? Only when I'm drunk. You said it's our last night together. I don't have to understand Chinese to know that. But what are you so sad about? This world is so small now. It's not like we are never going to meet each other. I mean "one another" again. We won't. We'll be so busy with our working lives. There will be no reason or motivation to connect with one another. Well... Maybe in the beginning, we'll tag one another in the pictures of our trip. But after that, we'll be so busy working, meeting deadlines... getting promoted, dating, getting married, having children. And before you know it... 30 years will have passed. Penny, don't cry. No matter how busy I get... I promise... to always... poke you on Facebook. Hey, you come here, too. I love you both very much. Even if we never meet again, please know that... you two have made me very happy. And I will always keep you two in my memories... wherever I go, whatever I'll be doing. Forever. To the 3 Peas Road Trip. You don't say. Peter! Peter! Hey! Wake up! We're going to be late! Peter is nowhere to be found. I'll go to the bathroom. Perry? Do you think this is what heaven looks like? What's wrong? Stop being so unhappy all the time! You'll never understand. Let's just have some fun before I lose my freedom forever, okay? Just grant me that. Peter's body was found at the bottom of Prospect Hill. According to the forensic report, he jumped at about 6:00 in the morning... which was right after sunrise. I promise... to always... poke you on Facebook. When did Peter make that decision? Just... get a life! I guess we'll never know. It's a shame that Peter only found peace... after he gave up on life. Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life. Peter was right. We really don't understand. What are you waiting for? Send it! Yeah! Nice one! All right, let's go out for a celebration. Let's go! We didn't understand that a life where you have everything... and yet nothing to look forward to... is really no life at all. Dear Father, I'll live my life the way I want Hey! Wait for me! Sometimes I feel really guilty. Other times, I'm mad at you. But mostly... I just miss my friend. Hello? Auntie... this is Penny. Perry is talking to Peter's parents now. Okay. Okay, I'll tell him. Okay, bye-bye. If you love taking pictures so much, why don't you get yourself a camera? This phone can take really good pictures. I don't need a camera. And I can store a lot of pictures on this phone. It's portable and convenient. Peter! One, two, three. Are you for real? I only started working out recently. Do you know my name means "rock"? Who would name their son after some rock? Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. Gorgeous. Remarkable. Okay. On one condition. I plan the trip. That's impossible. I remember booking three rooms. What are you doing? I'm booking the rooms. Your K-pop star wants three rooms. I have to book them before they run out. I think it's inappropriate for you to sleep in the middle. You come over here. What? What was that I felt? What was what? Oh, please. I think you're the one that I should be wary of. This is a call from room 136. Do you have an extra cot or mattress? No? Okay. They've run out. Excuse me. Okay. I know everything about you. Your everything includes his everything. So, naturally, I know everything about him. I bought it at the store yesterday. I have one, too. There are lots of things you don't know about me. How many relationships have you had before? None. Are you in love with someone now? You and I If we could be together You and I If there were love We would be like two stars in the sky Then we might as well say "apart." -I'll just wait for the printout. -Sure. Are you going away for the holidays? If I flunk this, I'm going back to Singapore. -I'm sure you'll do well. -Thank you. I'll just get the printout for you. Okay, don't show me! -Okay, I'm sure they'll be good. -Thank you. -Your card. -Thanks so much. -Have a good day! -See you. Bye. Those are my results. Look, I don't know what you're talking about. I already have a boyfriend. And these are clearly my... You're really sick, you know that? Who are you? You're the one who deserves to die. Not Peter! I'm sorry. We came all the way to Singapore for this photo shoot. We'd like to choose a few more pieces. I've picked four pieces. Please have a look. We need to match these jeans. So, let's take a look at this green short-sleeved shirt. This one? I still lead an ordinary life. Mostly, I keep myself busy. But even when I'm at my busiest... I can't help but think of those days in Australia. Because our commercial... I really hope that Peter is happy now. I'm sure he's in heaven now, playing harps with cherub angels. He's a great body. Hey, you don't believe me? Allen, show her what you've got. I sometimes wonder... how the other Pea is doing? Whatever it is, I'm sure he's doing well. No gym, no work. You know? That's just the way that Pea is. He'd never let his innermost feelings get in the way of his daily life. There is only room for success, no failure allowed. That's just how he's wired. It's just a photo shoot. Why does it have to be so early? They have the most beautiful sunrise here. The sun doesn't rise in Taiwan? Why do we have to come all the way here? Exactly, and we can digitally enhance the pictures nowadays. You'll be pleased with the results after you see the photos. It's worth coming up here for the sunrise. The sun is coming out. Get ready, okay? Standby! Do your final touch-up. We need to give off a cheery feel, so bigger smiles. -Okay. -Okay? Come on! Okay, ready? Okay, smile. Okay, one more? Here we go. Okay, change your pose. Hold that pose. -Please adjust your position. -Can I touch him like this? Okay. Touch your hair. Good. The light is perfect. You look beautiful. The two of us suck at planning anyway. Hey! I don't! I just haven't really found something I want to plan for. Yeah, right! Hey! What about me? You want to marry Dae Jung-geum? -I thought you wanted to marry me! -What? You want her to marry you, so she can continue doing your work for you in Korea. Well, then I think you'll have to come, too. To help her do my work for me. Please just have it, for planning the best trip of my life. Good, let's continue. Bigger smiles, please? More body language. Very good! One more! How about a "headache" pose? Yes... having a headache! How about a "stomachache" pose? Got it. How about a "painful knees" pose? Bend your body forward a little bit more. Yes! All three of you are supermodels. Don't be a disgrace to Taiwan, okay? -Let me tell you-- -Very good. -You need to open up your body. -Okay. -Open up... -Show me how to open up... Okay, just like that.
