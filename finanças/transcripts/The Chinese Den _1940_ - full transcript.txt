CHINESE BUNGALOW Subtitles by Nostromo So this is the great wild life of Singapore What's this place called? "Tanga Tanga", Sir,a very lively spot,Sir So they tell me Stubbins hasn't been out with me for three years and finding it by the way by Singapore Have you sampled it yourself? -What? Me,Sir? -Oh,yes Certainly not,Sir I'm a family man I don't go to such places -Stubbins,where have you been so long? -Beautiful moonshine Later on,can't you see I'm busy,get off You did say this was your first visit,didn't you? Yes,Sir,a case of mistaken identity,Sir They thought they'd met me at the Mission - A table for two, gentlemen? -Thank you I don't think much of this table Very full tonight Everybody in Singapore comes to Tanga Tanga. What about one of the alcoves? This is what all we have - Aren't they empty? - No, no,it's occupied -No,look,the curtains are drawn -No,sorry,Excellency,it's occupied Excuse please Sit down,forget it Are they all like that? Good evening Dr Cameron - Hello,Mr Lum.How are you? - Very well,thank you You like a nice table? No, no.Don't bother,I'm just having a look around Certainly,certainly Hello, young fellow,my lad Never seen you among the bright lights before Made it to my brother's party Harold,it's Dr Cameroon. -How do you do-How do you do - New out here? Yes,three days.Leaving tomorrow morning for Suruh rubber plantations - Suruh? - Yes what's the matter with Suruh No,there's nothing that matters with Suruh -It's a great place... for rubber -Go easy with him,will you? Don't pay any attention to me,I'm just an old blither You'll get there all right , a wee bit lonely maybe But I'll give you a bit of advice. Did you ever heard the moral of the crocodile and Chinaman's wife? I can't say I have Well. If you ever should be attempted No,I won't spoil your fun,later perhaps For all I've seen of Malaya so far,I like very much But you haven't seen Suruh Well,goodbye,I'll look in and see you some day - Good night. -Good night,Doc She is an English girl! How much have ever been read of love Too much have ever been said of love And few of said hearts have been broken. -What's she doing here? -Earning a living I expect A callous remark a yes means no a callous remark that keeps tormenting your soul so smaller things can bore deep in the one of you desire. And I'm dying grief that love has to end the hopeless belief that any heartache will mend until you hear a voice that comes through there's no smoke without fire When it began would you have thought a man could ever mean so much to you then? She's lovely Well,I wouldn't get too worked up about it Only book for Hong Kong next week and Shanghai the week after And I leave for up river in the morning What heartless mistake and then from regret a faultless mistake that you can never forget because you are afraid that comes to haunt you and no smoke without fire Just my luck as soon as I need a real stunner But you haven't met her yet. But I'm going to Always a little up to it But he is a very nice gentleman, he wants very much to meet you But I don't want very much to meet him -Good night, Mr. Lum -Please, Miss Sadie. Wait just one,just one little minute. Excuse,please -Yes,gentlemen? -The young lady who has just been singing Sorry she's gone home already Don't be silly she hadn't have time to change. I'm commander Marquess, this is my brother. Will you take her a message? We should very much like to meet her I tell you,please, she's very busy. - Do you like very much to see her? - Yes, of course,we would You come again tomorrow night I thought you were up against the famous Chinese wall,you don't know it Come on - Stubbins - Sir,aye -Don't let us break up the party,Stubbins -Stubbins,your Tanga tanga is a flop Where do we go from here? Follow me,Sir,I'll show you around the mission You make a big mistake. He's a really nice gentleman - He owns plenty cars,plenty,plenty house - I don't care if he owns the bank. He does own the bank now please sit down just one minute and make a little talk with him Now listen, Mr. Lum.We made a contract,haven't we? Yes,sure And it's a very nice contract. But there is nothing in it about sitting down making talk with nice gentlemen. And if there is I'm not not going to do it,not even with nice gentlemen who own banks May I express my entire sympathy,Miss Merivale I couldn't help help overhearing your natural protest Let me offer my apologies for the annoyance my request has called you -Your request? -This is my friend,Honourable Yuan Sing. - And then. yes.. - I'm afraid so. I wouldn't have to take the step but for the impression that you might be leaving for England very soon Well,yes I am Then I'm very glad my selfish wish to meet you has outweighed my courtesies You make me feel that something has outweigh mine - Am I forgiven? - I think we're quit I'm sorry I was rude to you I would like to stay a little while You are very kind, Miss Merivale. After (pour?) three things are expecting us : food,a little wine and a little conversation. Isn't that Omar Khayyam? No. Ming Chen who lived two thousand years before him,but still true. It is,it's began to work already I was so worried you may misunderstood my motives in seeking to meet you tonight,Miss Merivale - Well, I know,I... - Will you drink? Thank you. I will be frank with you. I've been interested in you from the moment when I first saw you Oh. - How very kind - Is it? - Well... yes. For someone who... - Who is not a Westerner? There are a quiet a lot of ordinary human instincts in the East,Miss Merivale In fact, my ancestors believed that barbarism - was an occidental claim - How extraordinary But of course we've learned since the right to be called civilized must rest on high explosives bombs. So we are sadly out of date - That's true they are laughing.. - No, no, no.I assure you know I just love the east. You see, Miss Merivale I have some other interests besides banks Tell me about them Well My bungalow up the river It contains my best loved treasuries I'm sure you would appreciate it Why me? Because I believe there is an affinity between lovely things. I wish I could believe that Perhaps you allow me to convince you. But there isn't very much time, you see, I'm leaving on Saturday Then I must demonstrate the fuse of it by Saturday. Wish me good luck with it,Miss Merivale Saturday. Do you like it? It's like an enchanted castle. I only hope I can live up to it How far is the nearest house from here? The Suruh plantation is 5 miles across the river. Otherwise there is no house for thirty miles. And now I will show you your new home. What a darling baby. What's her name? Amida. He's welcoming the new Mistress of the Chinese Bungalow Thank you very much. What shall I call you? Unfortunately he doesn't understand English But you'll be so soon be learning to speak Chinese. I call this the lacquer room I've combed both the east and the west to make it perfect. Up here it is cooler Will you enlarge the little dream of mine? At last my ambition is fulfilled. To see the chair occupied. Is this where we sit when people come? People? Yes. When we entertain The young partner from Suruh is the only man within a day's journey And I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance This is Ayah. Perhaps she would like to show you to your room. Yes thank you,I should like to tidy up The Madame is happy with her room? -Oh,you speak English. -Oh,yes Oh what a beautiful coat It is a present for the Madame from his Excellency It's exquisite It was once worn by the empress of China at the imperial palace of Beijing Oh,a weeping sleeve,we can weep into Those the Madame will never need It is the gamelan The Malay honours the Madame's arrival,singing and dancing Sing That music is so thrilling - Take me to see them dancing -There's no need I've conveyed your thanks to them already But there's music and dancing - Can't we go and look at them? - No, they don't expect it. They might not even appreciate it. -You mean they might..? -Exactly. We leave them to amuse themselves in their own primitive way Come,come relax. What perfect here Cool night air scent of flowers music I'm going to be happy here. I know I'm going to be happy Hello there! Doc! This is grand.What are you doing up river? I'm on my way to Baya Morgan is in with a fever. - You stop and have some food? -No,no time for anything But a drink,ha ha Doc,this is grand You know,I'm not going to let you rush off -I need your advice professionally too -What's wrong with you? Here an unadulterated boredom. You know how I'm going to stick it out until I get my Singapore leave I felt the same way myself twenty years ago. But I learned one thing. And that is that you can face anything viewed through the right end of a glass You know this place is share hell. I don't see a white man once in a blue moon and it's just my luck that my only neighbour should be a Chinese. Oh that's reminds me You'd better have a look at this So you see,your district is becoming quite fashionable Good Lord I've seen her in Singapore. She's marvellous - I say,this is a really lucky break - Don't be a damned fool Married woman never ever Well, goodbye I look back again on my way back from Baya. Good,remember me to Morgan and don't drink all his whiskey And you remember: if it is a choice between a crocodile and a Chinaman's wife Pick the crocodile. - It's safer. - Goodbye. Cheer,Doc No,no give me something else His Excellency would like it. Take it away. Good morning,my cherry blossom. Did you sleep well? Yes,thank you But how is it that you never wear that coat I gave you the other day? Well,it's too hot. Oh,yes you look pale. Shadows under your eyes It's the heat.What's that? Oh,you're not going away again Well,unfortunately, I must go to Singapore on business. Singapore? Well,then I can come with you. Oh,that's impossible. And besides, if you've no colour in your cheeks in this cool bungalow what would happen to you in the heat of Singapore? But I don't like being left here alone Do you realize that since we've being married I haven't seen a single fresh face? You are not content with your husband? Yes but... You go away on business for weeks at a time and leave me with nothing to do. There's no one to talk to And without people to talk to you are lonely Well, it's only natural to want to see people. Don't you understand? Please, Sing,please take me with you. It is because you are lonely that I'm going away No,don't talk in riddles This is no riddle,I've seen that you are lonely So I'm going to Singapore to bring you back a present which will cure your loneliness. Come with me to the landing station and see me off Hello,stranger Oh, hello Been a luck catching you like this what are you doing outside the prison walls? Well,I've just been seeing my husband off for Singapore. Oh,then I come in I've always wanted to see around your place Oh no I'm afraid you can't possibly Are you afraid I might pinch the silver? - No,but -But-me-no-buts That's Shakespeare,I think Goodbye, Mr. Marquess What's the rush? What are you planning to do today? Nothing Neither am I so we might as well do it together No,really, I can't Oh come along,we'll have a lot of fun Besides it's a criminal offence to leave you all alone All right. - I'll come - That's grand Now come along,careful how you get in there That's right Come in You can take the big trunk Miss Charlotte Merivale? Oh,yes Did Mr. Sing send you to meet me? I am Yuan Sing You! But... I expected... You expected a very impressive figure in mandarin robes with the conventional pig tail? No,of course not I apologize if I disappointed you. But I'm most happy to welcome my sister-in-law. Is Sadie here? No. As I told you in my letter, I wanted your visit to be a complete surprise to her -Is she well? -Oh,very well. But very lonely. That's why I decided to ask you to come out and join us It was very kind of you I was worried to death about her Until I had your letter I hadn't heard anything for months. And was the news in my letter a shock? Yes,frankly I suppose it was And yet you accepted my invitation I believe in seeing for myself Do you realize that you may be condemned by public opinion for coming to my house? I never listen to what other people say Come in,you can take the bags -Then I suggest we leave immediately -Oh yes Your sister finds life in the bungalow very lonely Well,we backed all the winners of Ascot so we are rich. Let's go down Piccadilly. What a lovely smell of buses and taxis. We'll drop in to Berkley's for a nice long.. -Iced cool -Lager? Gin fling That's was good -What about the other half? -Still we are on go to another place -You know,where should we go... - I don't know. -Savoy? -Savoy no?I think that's too crowded. Yes it is a bit,yes I know the very spot A tiny little place in Jermyn street with the lights are low And you look so lovely it won't be true -Now you've spoilt it all -Why? Because it isn't true. It's beautiful You like it? I love it Where's your mistress? She's in her room,Yuan Tell her I'd like to see her This is my favourite room. This is one of the oldest copies in existence of the word of the master Confucius. Princeliest of man,truly benevolent,truly wise who neither anticipates deceive nor suspect bad faith in others, will promptly detect them when they appear -Have you read Confucius? -At London University I thought I heard the gong did my husband come back? Oh,yes,he's awaits you in the lacquer room And this is the knife of the ancient emperor Hu Zhou. It looks like solid gold. Baser metals would have been unworthy of its purpose What was its purpose? On a certain historic occasion One side of the blade was coated with a deadly poison But only one side. So a pinch divided between the emperor and his guest How.. I hope you forgot which side is which Charlotte. - Sadie,darling - Oh, Charlotte. I can't believe it's true - And how did you get here? - Ask that husband of yours. This is the present from Singapore which I promised you. Oh,if you knew when you left Why didn't you tell me? I know it was foolish,perhaps, but I wanted to surprise you Wait a minute Come please,come Sadie Sit down here for a moment. Look. The Mistress of the Chinese bungalow. Worth waiting for Sing,I do wish you wouldn't treat me as I was a part of your art collection Come on, Charlotte, I'll show you to your room All right, Ayah, you can go. Do you like it? Very pretty My room is just across the corridor so I should be quite near you. What's the matter,Sadie? - Aren't you glad to see me? - Of course I am. Why didn't you let me know you were coming? Sing insisted I shouldn't Why I wonder? Listen I'm the one ought to be upset I've been desperately worried about you Why didn't you write and tell me everything? Well no one likes admitting failure You did pick up a rather row when I went on that tour and... crashed I knew you were broke Then I met Sing and you know the rest Don't you love him? -Yes of course I do -God bless, he adores you But sometimes I wonder if I'm not just an addition to his art collection. He seems to be one of the gentlest and kindest people I'd ever met I know he is But I feel he'd be very different if anything happens to upset him Surely nothing has? No,no of course not. Just rather a frightening thought that's all BTW I brought you a wedding present as I came through Singapore. -You're sweet. What is its? - And if you like them -Charlotte,they are lovely -They are very old. Time to dress for dinner,we are very quite westernized here Gently sit,Sibilla gently Remember your manners. Or our heart of jade will be ashamed of you. What was it you called me? Oh,it's just a foolish habit of mine Finding special names for those who are near and dear to me. Sing, please. I've asked you before not to feed that animal in this room. - But poor Sibilla must have her supper - Yes, but I told you Gives me the shivers Just like that music in this room gives me the shivers Come on, let's dance. Come along,Sibilla - Go inside and wait for me -Sing,it's horrible Go inside, both of you please Tungo has killed them both Who has Tungo Killed? His wife and Abdul who was my mother's cousin. Why did he do it? Abdul was her lover. Tungo discovered them tonight. I warned Abdul it was dangers with the Chinese woman. He wasn't listening This is horrible So was the crime it avenged But it's murder. I prefer to call it retribution But surely you arrested the man Yes,it was necessary he should be arrested He was a fool I believe in your heart you sympathize with him. I understand him But you can't kill people for that sort of thing. In our race marriage is a complete possession And they do not tolerate thieves Sing,please,I feel tired I'm going to bed - Yes - Come on Charlotte. Good night, cherry blossom. Good night heart of jade, sleep well. -Our next Suruh will be in four hours -Yes,I think so,Sir.-Good -Once there looking at his plantation. -Aye,aye Help! What's that? Sounds like a woman's voice to me,Sir It is a woman. A white woman. Looks a bit all right for me too,Sir Begging me pardon - See what's she is up to,Stubbins. -Aye,aye,Sir. Hello,there,what's happened? Lost my paddle I've been drifting for about an hour. Who? What are you? River patrol,we're always knocking around here That's right,Miss,always on the spot up on the cox - You are on your way up streams? - Yes,Suruh Then you pass where I come from You'd be very kind to drop me? Of course,if you tell me where you've come from It's the Chinese bungalow. -What do you mean this.. - I'm Charlotte Merivale. Good Lord - Why? Do you know me? - Yes,of course and the sister I gather we are quite well known in Malaya That's inevitable. Yuan Sing is always news around here Let me rather be put on shore I can find my own way back Heavens know,I didn't mean anything,I'm terribly sorry I'm sorry too I'm Richard Marquess. Are you a relation to Harold Marquess? Yes,he is my brother.Why? Do you know Harold? My sister and I have seen something of him recently,usually on the river Oh,then we are all well friends around here. -Would you like a drink? -I'd love one Well,come on,let's go below, we've got a lot of time Sadie! Sadie! Sadie! Sadie. Sadie! Ayah. Ayah. Who's there? Ayah. I've been looking for you everywhere. Come here. Where's my sister? In her room. No,she isn't,you're lying. Did she clear you to say that? You're wearing her beads She allowed me,she loves me I see,so you hold your tongue Where is she? I not know. Yes you do,and you're going to take me to her straight away But she tell me to watch so they don't see them See them? Ayah,take me to her at once, at once do you hear me? I'm afraid Only an owl. The owl is the devil. -He bring misfortune and death -You're talking nonsense. Go on, Ayah,go on. I really must go darling, Charlotte will miss me Go and make sure all the servants are in their quarters Then watch by the main gate When am I going to see you again? Sing will be probably be back tomorrow. Darling, I'm so frightened,I don't know how to face him now I'll never let you go I love you,darling I love you Charlotte. - What are you doing here? - Looking for you. - What did you hear? - What no one else should ever hear -Now,listen, Charlotte,you mustn't. -No use to try to fool me,Harold Very well then I'll tell you We love each other,what are you going to do about it? Not what I am going to do about it the question is what your husband will do. Charlotte,he mustn't know. If you are in earnest about it, he's got every right to know -All right,let him,I'm not afraid of him -Do be sensible. You are both very childish and irresponsible. Charlotte,I've been so lonely and miserable You can't realize how lonely I've been Then I met Harold and... I understand you, Sadie. But you're Sing's wife I don't love him,he frightens me Poor kid she had an awful time And I'm going to see to it that she doesn't stand it any more He's not one of your kulis in your plantation you know Anyway, you must get away from here quickly,come along Wait here while I'll make sure everything is safe It's all right. Open the gate. This is very charming to be welcomed on the threshold by my wife,my sister in law and This is Mr. Marquess of the Suruh plantation across the river - Mr Marquess, it's a great honour. -How do you do And a neighbourly thought to anticipating my homecoming and arrive to greet me We didn't expect you... So it was not me that Mr Marquess came to visit? Well... No, Mr. Sing,actually I Sing, you arrived at a rather thrilling moment We hadn't intended to tell anyone,yet,but Well,naturally you're anxious to know why Mr Marquess is here. The fact of the matter is We are engaged to be married Is he your lover? He's my fiance We've just got engaged tonight. Well,isn't anyone going to congratulate us? I do hope you forgive butting in so late in the evening I was looking for my brother. Richard. Perhaps I better introduce myself. Everyone on the river knows Commander Marquess. It is for me to do the introducing First my wife. How do you do Her sister,Miss Merivale. We met this afternoon. I hope you are none the worse for your adventure Your adventure,heart of jade? I was on the river this afternoon my paddle broke I was gallantly rescued by the patrol launch Mr Marquess,your brother is usurping your privileges. It's you who should have done the rescuing Yes I should I called at your bungalow,and gathered from your servants that you'd come over here Oh,yes of course The your brother is not aware of the thrilling news? No,I suppose not I'll tell him then,shall I? Please do We are celebrating the betrothal of your brother with my sister in law,Miss Merivale What? Accept my congratulations. Thank you. You too Thanks Well,I think I'd better be going Perhaps you take me across on the launch? Oh,but we can't let such an occasion go by without toasting the happy couple Oh,don't bother about us -Beside it's getting rather late - No, no. What would my cherry blossom think of me if I didn't celebrate her sister's happiness? Of course Commander. -Come along then -Thank you Come Hello,Snow White. I don't suppose they are thinking sending us a couple of bottles out here To the happy couple. To the happy couple. - Death is hovering here - Yeah. Wait,what? I smell terror and sorrow Shut up That's Chinese cooking And I don't want to be rude but I think I must be going I'm on duty, you know. You'll take me across,won't you,Richard? But the bottle is still half full and you got your own boat Yes I know, but...I'm sure you must be tired after your long journey If you are not I am, been an exciting day for me Of course it has I'll see Commander Marquess off and rejoin with you later Thank you. -Good night Mrs Sing -Good night - Good night Miss Merivale - Good night. I can only wish you every happiness. You'll look me up on your way down river? Yes,of course, if I have time. Many congratulations Wait until they are through the gate. Before you go,Commander Marquess Tell me, were you aware that your brother was attached to Miss Merivale? No,I knew nothing about it But then I haven't seen him for some time I somehow feel that you are surprised. Well, it was a bit of shock - Do you think he suspect? -Of course he doesn't - I wonder - Please don't leave me alone with him. - I can't be left alone with him - Be careful. - We will find a way out later - Later? You don't understand. Good night Mr.Sing,and again thank you Good night Commander Marquess,it's been a great pleasure to have met you Richard will help us,when he comes back... - Take me away,you said you love me. - You know I do Pull yourselves together,here's Sing What the devil? Hello. Look, Sing.Sibilla has taken a sort of fancy to Harold. Yes,Sibilla is a woman. And what woman is not flattered by masculine attention? I'm afraid all this excitement has been rather too much for my cherry blossom. She looks pale and drawn I'm tired, it's getting late. Then I suggest you leave the lovers to say their farewell and come indoors with me They are well provided for They have each other and the moon. That guides and misguide lovers Good night. - Sing,I'm going straight to bed now - Oh,spare me a few moments next It's so much I want to talk about,come sit down First of all,do you approve of your sister's lover? What's that got to do with me? Perhaps you didn't want Charlotte with so.. - So... - Clever? Well,fastidious would be nearer my meaning Do you not want her to be satisfied with this young man? How should I know,I'm not like Charlotte No,you're not like Charlotte But he belongs to the flip and (?) of Singapore Now if it had been his brother She only met him today. Oh,well But tell me,my cherry blossom. Do you consider Harold Marquess a desirable guest in my house? Why do you ask me? Why don't you find out all these things from Charlotte? I'm finding out a quite of number of things from you What have I said?Why are you torturing me with all these questions? Torturing? You must have a touch of fever. You know I would never hurt you,my cherry blossom unless you deserve it And of course you don't I brought Sibilla back to you -I had a job to get her away from Harold -Has he gone? Yes,I'm afraid we were rather a long time Parting is a sweet sorrow You see,I know my Shakespeare. Oh Charlotte. - Sing is rather angry about Harold. - Me,angry? Am I a barbarian? How could I be angry at my heart of jade heart I am only rather overwhelmed with admiration - For her courage. - Courage? To take the love of another upon yourself That is a great adventure. Ah ,I see Well,I've had enough adventures for one day.I'm tired out. Are you coming,Sadie? - Goodnight Sing. - Goodnight heart of jade Goodnight, cherry blossom. Faithless Sibilla Hello,Marquess. A bit of luck you turning up Hello,Doc,what are you doing here? Nothing wrong with Harold is it? I'm afraid it is. Blood poisoning. -Oh God,can I see him? -You can - Is he bad? - He is I'm very worried. How the devil did he get it? You never can tell in this country. Sadie. Sadie. - Hello. - Listen. What's the matter? I thought I heard a boat. Why doesn't Harold come over? - I think it is very wise not to - Charlotte. You don't think anything happened to him,do you? Of course not,how could it - You mustn't talk like that. - I don't trust Sing either - Why did he send Harold that cat? - I guess it's a little unfair That's what you think but you don't know Sing. He never does anything without a notice - I'm sure he suspects - You imagine that - He has no right to interfere. -You married Sing. He has every right for you to expect to live up to it Then he shouldn't have brought me here. Perhaps he shouldn't I think he hoped to make your marriage happy and successful - That's all very well but it doesn't help - Not unless you try to help too I'll aim to ask Sing to take you downstream. You both need some good fresh air. Charlotte,you think that will patch up things,don't you? But it won't,it's gone much too far Don't you want to go? I'd go anywhere and do anything rather than stay in this place Darling why it is so tragically easy to get married? Some of us poor spinsters find it tragically hard That's better the first smile I've seen for a week. I am so glad you are here. Come in Yuan says will the dames be pleased to join him? Oh,Charlotte,you go,say I'm lying down I've got a headache Oh,come along darling Just to please me Oh my two gentle souls Sadie had a headache, she's feeling better now Oh I am so glad Because I thought you'd like to help me welcoming a visitor Who are you expecting? Look Commander Marquess, come on in. It is a great pleasure. But surely that is not Sibilla you're bringing back to me? Can I speak privately,Mr Sing? Now don't tell me your brother feels embarrassed of her attachment? I have resigned myself to her deserting me Mr Sing. - I should prefer to speak to you alone - Has anything happened to Harold? Please,tell my wife what she wants to know,Commander Marquess Very well I am sorry that I have to tell you that my brother died this morning. Died? But how? Blood poisoning Have you no words of comfort for your sister,cherry blossom? It is she who is bereaved Is it not? Charlotte, I She's fainted - The shock has been too much for her - I must get her to her room. - I will take her - I'll call Ayah. - I'd prefer to look after her myself - I'll come with you. No,my heart of jade You have sorrow enough on your own I want to thank you for everything you did - Then you know -Yes,Harold told me just before he died He said you've been splendid. It was all I could think of to save the situation. I hope it did Harold really thought that Sing might have guessed You don't think he has? Sadie thinks so, but I'm not sure I was hoping that Sadie and Sing could get away from here they might come together again - But now... - Now you don't think so - You saw Sadie's face just now - Yes,I did and so did he What can he do? I don't know I have a horrible pre-sensitize -Look here,if you are really scared -Of course I'm not Leave it to me I'll talk to Sing. Anyway whatever happens, if you need any help, you can always count on me. We can't drag you into this I'm in it now through Harold and I'm going to stay in it,you understand? Thanks I'm glad you're here. It's funny,Sadie said that to me just now It isn't funny at all,it's very sound I'm glad I'm here too. You know,I may seem to be an odd time and place to say it but I'd rather be here than anywhere in the world,really Sing or no Sing I'm going to get you out of this place right away I can't leave Sadie. - We can take her too. - We can't,she is his wife. We mustn't let Sing find out about about us At least not until we got things straightened out for Sadie You must go now, please. Come back tomorrow. Suppose if things go wrong? We must have some way for you to let me know Guard,he's coming. I'll leave Stubbins beside the river All you have to do is to get in touch with him,he know where to find me You are leaving,Commander? Yes,I'm afraid I must Then I'm just in time to say goodbye. Goodbye,Miss Merivale. Don't forget that if there is anything I can do ,you only just let me know I assure you,you have no need to be anxious about Miss Merivale I will do everything in my power to help and comfort her Thank you. Sing. I want to talk to you I'm always at your command Shall we go in? This was how I first brought you into my house Will you indulge a little and agree with my mind? Of course It needs a Manchu lady to grace this chair properly Please. Sing. Do you wish to speak to me? It's about Sadie. I want you to let me take her down streams for a little while She is unhappy, Sing. Terribly unhappy. I've been unhappy too I'm sorry. It is not necessary for you to pretend ignorance of the cause But I respect your loyalty to your sister. - I don't understand. - I know you do understand And I've made my decision The rest depends on you. On me? Now we are free to speak about things neither you nor I could put into words before - Sing. - Can you deny it? Sadie. Why did you leave your room? Because I wasn't going to stay there alone thinking Now at least I have something to think about Sadie, come away. Ever since you came I've seen him look at you He can hide most things but he can't hide that - How dare you speak to me like that - Sing,I don't care what he does to me So life is so empty for you now that your young Englishman. Be quiet both of you.You don't know what you are saying When did you meet him first? While I was away,wasn't it? If you know then,why do you ask -Did you meet him often? -No -How often? -I don't remember Everyday? - No, of course not. - Trifle three times a week? - Perhaps - Where? - I don't remember. - In his bungalow? - No. - Now was it in my own house,wasn't it? No,well anyway what does it matter? It matters a great deal to me. He was your lover, wasn't he? I won't answer you.You're driving me mad with your questions Sing, what are you going to do? Wait for her to tell me the truth. There is nothing to tell! Charlotte,don't let them take me away! You heard what she said, there is nothing to tell How do you respond? Oh no, Charlotte. All right,Sing.I'll tell you It wasn't Charlotte Harold came to see He was your lover. Yes And I loved him and if I had a chance, I'd gone away with him So now what are you going to do about it? That depends on your sister. You wouldn't dare harm her You understand me very little if you believed that. I made the mistake of believing that you were as beautiful as you appear But now I've find that I married a woman without worth Without decency Without morals. You've been horrible for me from the beginning. I've been lonely and miserable and you didn't care. Poor little cherry blossom So you sought your consolation in the arms of the Englishman Sing, let me talk to you. Talk to him,Charlotte,you're mad, don't you realize Or do you? You had better go now You think you can get Charlotte, don't you? You think you can get anybody you want but you won't this time There is someone else Sadie. It's Richard. He loves her. And she wants him So you'll never get her Is this true? Yes Charlotte. The guard isn't there.You know what to do. Hello,(?).A cup of tea? A cup of tea before a walk along the towpath? Quiet I have a message for the Mr Oh,what is it? Best you try quickly,at once - Yes,is there anything I can do? - No,no best for you to run It is as good as done - He go quickly - I'm going to my room. Let me know directly when Marquess comes. Ayah, is that you? Why am I summoned here like this? - These servants... - They haven't exceeded my orders,I hope. Why didn't you send Ayah of your message? I don't trust the Ayah for messages. Heart of jade You have nothing to fear from me. I'm not afraid. Then why did you send for Richard Marquees? Did you stop my message? No. I shall be very glad to see him - What harm has he ever done to you? - None But there is a danger of his becoming an annoyance An annoyance? So I would regard it,if it became between you and me. That I will never permit You will never permit? Who is this English man who appreciate the highest excellence of a woman with.. I've found in you all I ever hoped to find in this misguided woman who was my wife Virtue,loyalty,understanding. Oh,heart of jade If only I'd met you first Sing. Do you realize what you're saying? Do you realize what I said? But... It's an insult! Why? Aren't we man and woman? - But my sister... - You know what your sister has done And there is only one punishment. - Sing,you can't... - You love your sister. You risked your own name to save her. Now I give you a chance to do more You can save her life. Do you hear the sound? It's the pantoum.The love song of the Malaysians. Heart of jade,there is still time. The gates are shut and they can remain so with Richard Marquess and his whole world outside Can't you understand? Richard and I love each other. Your gates can't keep him from me Or me from him You love him? That is all you have to say? Yes The servants will take you to your sister - Sadie. - Charlotte. I wish to see Miss Merivale. - You look heated, Commander Marquess - Where is Miss Merivale? Is it not strange that neither you nor your lamented brother ever called to see the master of the house? I came here to see Miss Merivale And I am not leaving until I do First it's essential that you and I should have a little talk Would you be seated? Please do Cigarette? And since you've hurried so,a drink? Charlotte, look. I see you appreciate fine things, Commander Marquess. These goblets were last used at the imperial court in Peking I'm very flattered,Mr Sing They look like solid gold. I assure you baser metal would be unworthy of an occasion of such importance A baser metal would be unworthy Sadie,that's what he said about the emperor's golden knife,the poison knife He wouldn't dare... I thought that once I'll give you an English toast. May the best man win. Very well I'm afraid I don't quite understand you And now Mr. Sing. Commander Marquess. Your brother made love to my wife I can only say that I'm very sorry I hope you will not find it very difficult to understand that a Chinese has a point of honour According to the creed of my ancestors A matter of that kind can be wiped out only in blood And whose blood do you want Mr Sing? Mine? That duty to my ancestors has already been fulfilled. How so? - Do you mean my brother Harold - Your brother is dead, Commander Marquess. Yes,I know. I was with him when he died of blood poisoning. Exactly. My God. What are you suggesting? Your brother ran so many risks. So many quite unnecessary risks. For example, even a cat can be a risk. It can carry venom in its claws danger even to those who's handling her Siamese cat You murdered him. My dear Commander,just revenge is never murder And also I have admitted nothing We'll see about that I'm afraid that is unlikely When those sands have run out one of us will be dead Dead? It is a pity you are not familiar with our classics,Commander Marquess Or you would have recognized the method I have chosen to decide our destiny Don't mind about the classics, what have you done? To speak simply One of those cups was coated with a very ancient poison You are bluffing,Sing Why should you want me to die? Because, my friend, I do not intend to be interrupted a second time It's a mistake, I haven't tried to steal your wife. We are not speaking about my wife. Then it's Charlotte You poisoned me,the same way as my brother But you won't get away with it! Open that door. The door is barred on the outside. And you're misjudging me, Commander Marquess I don't fight unfairly I offered you the choice of cups So it's a duel with equal chances Watch You don't know which of those drinks was poisoned? I have no idea. It's mad,Sing Surely you don't think you can get away with this You can't shut out the Law even here I respect it far too much to try But I assure you that if I win No blame will be attached to me This poison leaves no trace. And I shall report your death with deep regret. If it should be seen a little premature You will not be the first in these latitudes to die from an undiscovered cause We must get out of here. We must do something. - You're growing restless,Commander. - I'm all right Are you afraid of death? I'm not afraid of anything you can stand up to I believe it. Soon one of us will strike this gong and the door will open Strange,is it not? When you came in here I hated you Now all that is changed In a few short minutes, our ways will lie apart Maybe we should just say farewell Why not? Smooth sailing,Sing. For you too. Happy journey I can't stand it.I can't stand it - Let me out! - Sadie! Sadie, calm down. Sadie! Keep calm. Look. Subtitles by Nostromo
