I'll kill you. These are regular to me. It's nothing. You'll get strained unnecessarily. Come and save me [chanting] [chanting continues] Hey Swami.. I’m not afraid of your spells because I’m not alone.. ..I'm a Almighty, which combined with 4 more powers. Who are those four? Nazia.. Mahalakshmi.. Mary.. ..and Kaveri. Though we didn't have bond of mother.. ..lack of father's lullaby.. ..as we're useless to this land.. ..we are called as orphans. Hi, the great anchor Mary is coming.. What is your nonsense? It’s not nonsense, it is my goal. Now let us know about your goals.. Tell me Mahalakshmi.. My dream is to be a dancer, bring fame to this orphanage. - All the best. Now what is your dream Nazia? I want to become a police officer and shoot, those people who throw kids like us in the trash. Gosh, All the best. Now, what is your goal? She wants to become a collector - Ok, good luck. What’s all this? - Mom, dad and myself… Then what about us? You all are.. ..my sisters. Hey, dad came. Greetings, sir - Greetings. Hand over it to me. Is everyone doing good? Everyone is fine, sir. A good news to all of you.. - What is it sir? I had an NRI friend, who earned a lot.. ..but has no kids. So, he wants to adopt an orphan. I want to send our Nazia, what do you all say? If god grants us a wish, will we deny it? Nazia, you are so lucky.. ..you have no worries, they will see you as a queen. My ambition is to fulfill all of your ambitions. Be ready tomorrow morning Nazia, I will take you. No one is there in our life, then daddy came to us like a sunrise We thought, Our ambitions will fulfill and we felt very happy. Why are you still sitting like that? Nazia, may call us. - Are you still thinking about Nazia? She has already left the country. ..do you think ,she'll still remember this poor life? She is living her life, let her live.. ..come and sleep. We thought she has to be happy, where ever she is. Later, Mahalakshmi also left us just like Nazia. Why are you seeing like that? This is also our house.. ..You take a bath and take rest, I’ll come.. Go.. Daddy.. Daddy.. Look at them daddy. Look dear, The most valuable thing in the world is.. ..women’s body. so I sold your body to them. Daddy… - Who the hell is your daddy? At that moment, realized that we came to know that he is not our daddy.. ..we are the dolls sold by him for his business.. We were held hostage, for the food he gives us.. ..in pursuit of maturity, we couldn't.. ..know that he hunts one after the other.. We became meat to satisfy their hunger.. The way how cruel animals eat deer's.. ..they tortured us. Thank you uncle, you gave a very good entertainment. I’ll tell my dad, and make sure your work gets done. Nice partner, you are getting contract by contract by selling these orphans.. ..you will sell this orphanage which costs crores today or tomorrow.. You're mistaken. this orphanage is like, a duck which lays golden eggs.. ..the orphans must be born, should grow up. Their graves are the foundation for my growth. Partner, get a small sign by your minister on this road contract. If you want a small sign by the minister then we need a small girl. There are still a lot of buds in the flower garden I grew. Sir, please leave her. she is too young she is like your baby.. ..we begged him by grabbing his legs but he didn’t leave us. Sister.. sister.. he is killing me. ..daddy is not good. - Hey to whom are you calling? Sister. - Come.. What happened? What dear, What happened dear? I do not understand what she's saying. She is getting mad because she has no friends Come, come dear.. ..nothing happened to you come. Thirsty.. Thirsty.. Thirsty.. Thirsty.. Hey.. I will get a new girl… ..we have nothing to do with her. so, tie her up and throw her in guest house. Hence, we have become ghosts to take revenge. Sir, there's a ghost in the girl you said to tie.. We can't stay here sir. This guy.. this guy.. the one who hunted us instead of protecting.. ..he made us dolls and sold us. He tortured and killed us. Why do you see orphans so low? We won’t spare them and won't leave any of them. We won’t let the same injustice happen to any other girl.. I‘ll kill every one. What? That girl is saying a story, and you people are listening? I can show sympathy by listening to your story.. ..but I can’t betray my professional ethics. Souls have no place on earth. [chanting] What will you do now? The first principle of my business is the girl’s body.. ..believing that I become what I’m now. Every girl in your orphanage has to become an investment to my business. Hey, disgusting. Even butcher pity orphans.. ..you are the one who should be in the father’s position. but.. It’s waste to talk with him - Let’s beat each of them Don’t leave them, let’s kill all of them. Hey.. - Sir. ..what are you looking? Start the game. Finish them. Bhikshapati, enough of making mistakes, your sins transcended the demons.. ..leave them. - Hey , I won’t leave you too as you also know my story. Sir, she dumped me many times, I'll take care of her Go on. Act against devil, gonna happen now. You came at the right time, Swami.. ..save me from these devils. [chanting] [chanting continues] You little vampires.. ..leave their bodies. Or else, these four who seek your good.. ..will die. This little devils power is too low, when compared to my evil power! Well done Swami! With the help of a man like you, a person like me can achieve anything. Swami! ..please bury all those souls without further delay. [chanting] They are not bodies to bury, they are the sins you have committed. They do not go away until you are buried. Feeling great about your evil power? God’s power will not spare you. God’s power? It’s already gone away long ago. Has God come ever? But see how many forces are behind me. This is Kali Yuga, it is our world.. ..and it is in our control. Our only control. You are wrong, Rama had only came to kill Ravan. Krishna had only come to kill Kaurava. With the blessings of all the million gods, these souls come as the greatest power to save these orphans. Will spirits come and fight with us! A war between evil spirits and souls? Is it possible to win.. ..anyway.. ..from where they'll come. From where they'll come. Call them. The souls which got harmed by men in this world.. ..come together so that we can fight.. ..and make sure the same will not repeat to other girl, Come.

In the process of taking revenge you lost peace. Stay calm now.. How to stay calm? Every day such, atrocities continue to happen to girls like us. Orphans like us continue to be born, people like him have been torturing us. We are worrying about our girls in our orphanage. Don’t worry about the girls in your orphanage.. ..we will take care of them. I will be their Mother He will be their Father. Congrats dear. Thank you. Don’t you ask why? What's there to ask? I know.. Mom and Dad. Grandpa, I found my wife… I too found my story. Thank god. - Congrats.. Then, I will stop all these thefts and join as an assistant director to you.
