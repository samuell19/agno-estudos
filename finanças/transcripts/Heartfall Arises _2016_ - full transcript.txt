When you look long into something, it becomes less familiar. This city, this building, this street, the people on it, even myself. Then a voice said to me, when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you. The most notorious serial killer in Hong Kong people called him The General. According to the statistics, all victims got away scot-free for their crimes. To date, 3 men have been killed. 24 hours before their murders, they each received a death notice. Even they tried to escape, no one was exceptional. We've less than 30 minutes to save Ben Lam the HK real estate tycoon. Can HK Police protect him and apprehend The General? The entire city is watching. Madam, 30 minutes and counting down, should we set the bait? Definitely! We're on our way over. John, Control is paging us. A city wide manhunt for the General, and you're playing chess. So? This is a setup called "Tempting the Tiger". Tell Madam Ho not to waste time. A real master must see through the game and the opponent. You know what an opponent is? I lose all the time! Enough! To win, you need your brain, not your temper. Got it? Calling control, the General is on Route 3 heading towards the airport. Leung Sir wants to seal off Ting Kau Bridge. Copy! Call SDU for back up! Hands up! Watch out! The suspect escaped! Madam, what now? Tell VIPPU to change location. Mr. Lam, we go to another safe house. Can you manage? Or just say no. General! He deserves to die. But it's not your call. Can the law stand for justice? Neither can you. Surrender. Never! Watch out! "6 months later" You'll lose. You can't even look at him, but he's staring at you. You're playing with a person, not a table. Show me. Pawn at 4 across to 5. Advisor at 6 up to 5. Draw. Let's play another. You need a break? You're a patient. So are you! Both of you are patients. Please go back to your rooms. Girlfriend? You can tell? What do you do? I'll tell you next time. Have you just met? I'll tell you next time. Come on... Sir, you should be in your room too. You're also a patient. I'm Calvin Che. John Ma. A rematch. "12 months later" Cellular Memory. This is Robert. American, 28 years old, weighs 118 kg. This was taken 16 months after surgery. This is also Robert. 68 kg. This was taken 3 months before surgery. No, he didn't have surgery to gain weight, he had a heart transplant. This is Tommy, the heart donor. He died of renal failure. His heart was given to Robert. This was Tommy's favorite food. Mine too. An American psychologist Gary Schwartz once conducted a research. He said up to 10% of organ transplant patients have inherited their donors' taste, thinking and even behavior. Cells contain biological data of human genetics. During an organ transplant, such data may have been copied to the new owner. Not only did Robert inherit Tommy's heart, but also his love for fries. He went from 68 kg to 118 kg. Professor, this is a criminal psychology class, why talk about organ transplant? If you had a heart transplant from a killer, would you want to kill too? We'll continue tomorrow. In a hurry? More psychoanalysis? Even a blind man can see that. There's nothing to analyze. It's common sense. Don't say anything. You need my help? Got it. It's the General. Don't do that! Let me finish. The Police put a gag order on the media. How did you know? Are you a fortune-teller or an undercover? This is psychoanalysis. I won't get into that now, you probably won't get it. Don't say anything. I will help you, on one condition. Madam! John, stop harassing me. Let me go back to the Crime Unit. For the last time, putting you in the file room was decided by the boss and your doctor. You had a heart transplant, keeping you on the force is the best I can do for you. I had a full recovery. I can't do a desk job. Then quit! If you keep harassing me, you won't even have a desk job. I think John Ma is most suitable. "Hong Kong Police" Blind chess! This doesn't count. I tricked you. Want to know what I think? The killer is a General copycat, that's why you came to me. Right on! John, Professor Calvin Che is a criminal psychologist, and our consultant on this case. Milton Ko from INTERPOL. He is in charge of the Special Task Force. Let's look at the screen. Ben Lam? Yes. He was killed this morning. We received an omen of death before dawn, but he was killed in less than 3 hours. In other parts of Asia, there were 2 similar cases. Ma, will you accept the challenge? If I solve the case, I want to be back in the Crime Unit. Reward is the best motivation. I think that's a yes. Madam Ho gave her consent. Welcome. Thank you, Sir! Rematch? It's hard to get a taxi here. Let me drop you. Why me? You grab the steering wheel with both hands, and you're only going 40 on a 50 speed limit. You're not the prudent type. You must really want to be reinstated. All cops want to catch the bad guys, and not stay home and cook. Because of the General? I caught one, I can catch another. Good! I was right about you. I picked the right person. Please let me off up ahead. By the way, the move you made... I really thought it was the General. After all, I'm the criminal psychologist. I haven't had hotpot for a long time! I'm so hungry. It's double-flavored. - Ready? - Almost. Let's eat. Delicious! What? Do you like spicy food? Of course! Don't I? Maybe not. It's ok. Don't force yourself. Eat your heart out! Don't you worry that I've changed? Everyone does. As long as not for the worse. - Happy birthday to you. - Happy birthday to me. Make a wish. Daddy, you're the best. You only just found out? I wanted this watch for so long. Mom, how did you know? I'll do anything to make you happy. I'm jealous now. Let me rephrase that. I'll do anything to make you both happy. There were 2 similar cases in Asia. The first one was 2 months ago. Sherman Ko, ex-Director of a HK hospital. Had his throat slit in a Taiwan villa. A chess piece was stuffed in his mouth. A month later, Malaysian tycoon Mr. Nali was same, killed in his backyard. Ben Lam is number 3. According to the Police reports, the fatal wounds of all victims and the chess pieces found at the scene matched the General's M.O.. But he was killed 18 months ago. We have no new leads so far. All victims were once prosecuted, but none convicted. Robin Hoodism. Like the General, the killer wants to be a super hero. According to the statistics, the General had no accomplice. He was not married, no siblings. Parents are dead. Not an accomplice, it's a new General! If that is the case, the killer will continue to kill. We must catch him as soon as possible. Any questions so far? You don't agree? Go now. The clock has been running for 100 years. But the General stopped it. The body was hung 45m off the ground, from a HK landmark. That doesn't fit the General's M.O. It's not coincidental, it's intentional. He left us a clue. "When you gaze long" "into an abyss," "the abyss also" "gazes into you." Nietzsche said that. It means if you immerse yourself in evil, you will inevitably become evil. That is to say, the General thinks he represents evil? A drunkard will never admit he's drunk. The General considers himself a super hero, comes to clear up all evil. Forensics found this invitation in the tower. The banquet is 7:30 tomorrow night. It should be the venue for the next murder. He left us the hint, hoping we'll show up. In order not to disrupt the banquet, the operation will be for monitoring purposes. Members of the Crime Unit will pose as waiters, position in points A, B, C & D. The remaining 6 exits, will be handed over to Leung Sir of SDU. Clear? Yes, Madam. You look horny! Dating a girl? We just met. What's that? For 5 months. Month, day, hr, min, sec. Is it cool? Young man. I also came up with a new APP. It's really cool! Not yet. Almost It's a montage game. You can key in anyone's head. Shall we try Madam Ho? I'll show you tomorrow. I still have work to do. Hi, Sue. I'll be home late tomorrow. I'm going to see a psychologist. I took your advice to check up. Ok? A psychologist? I'm pretty good at lying too. You know its basic rule? At least 30% is true. It's either to a woman or your boss. You just saw your boss, so it must be a woman. Psychologist? As if you never lie! I can't take your call right now. Please leave a message. I will call you back. Lying isn't the worst scenario but have nothing to say. Cheers. I shortlisted the targets. Kim Hae-jin, Korean financial magnate, Wen Nu, the Southeast Asia oil tycoon, Fong Siu Ping, cruise company CEO in Singapore, is the host of tonight's banquet. Who's more likely to be the target? I've no idea. But I have a bad feeling. Go... Calm down! The exit is over here! Don't push! This way, please! This way, please! Madam, what happened? The kitchen was on fire. Evacuate all ASAP. - Keep them safe. - Where are the targets? Most of them left, but we lost Fong Siu Ping. This way, please! - Hurry! - Go! - Follow me. - Go! No rush! Are you OK? Put this on! Is everything alright? Brenda, take care of her! Keep going! This way! Thank you. Don't thank me. Your colleague poured this. Thank you for saving me. I can't let you die. We still have a rematch. Fong is the CEO of a Singapore cruise company. The killer cut her throat. Time of death was about 15 mins after the fire. The killer posed as a security guard entered the hotel, placed an ignition device in the kitchen, during the evacuation, killed Fong. I saw the General last night. The security guard was the General. Ma Sir, I have double checked General's birth and school records. Sheldon Chiang had no siblings. A look-alike after plastic surgery? Who'd want to look like a serial killer? I'll check the hospital records. You didn't seem well last night. - Take some time off. - I'm fine! I know I saw the General. Ma Sir had a heart transplant, not a brain. It won't affect his judgment. It's OK then. Fine. Then let's go to work. Ma Sir! The girl you saved brought this. A cake and a jacket. She wanted to thank you. Thanks. I don't know her. Hi. It's delicious! Professor! It takes 16 muscles to frown but only 4 to smile. Smile more. I've delusions lately. Just now I felt it unconsciously. You mean seeing the General was a delusion? I don't mean the General. I saw a girl. The one you saved last night? After you saw this girl, you seemed out of sorts. My instincts tell me I've seen her before. Trust your instincts. Though I know you're big on logic, instincts is the key to survival. Sometimes it's more accurate than logic. A cigarette butt? I thought it's strange too. Smoking is not allowed in a 5-star hotel. Anyone who smokes in the kitchen will definitely be canned. Check this. What did you find? In the kitchen, we found a cigarette butt. "Lido Hotel." - John. - Tell Captain Ko. What's the matter? I'm fine. Go find that guy! You've medication? In the pantry. Feeling better? What's the situation? We have the room surrounded. OK! Let's go up! Action. Go! Go! Go! Shit! John. Ma Sir! Well? Nobody inside. The suspect wore this last night? Yes. What can it prove? "When you gaze long into an abyss," "the abyss also gazes into you." And if you add this? What do you think, Professor? Smoking will kill. Ok! Jack, check all the CCTV nearby, go door to door. Yes, Sir. Forensics is on their way. OK. Clear out. What's wrong? I'm fine. Ask what's wrong, not if you're fine. You seem to be dodging my questions. To save face, men often pretend nothing is wrong. You should know. You're sure OK? I'll tell you next time. John, what's up? Who else knows about today's operation? Just the Special Task Force. The glass of water is still warm, the killer must have just left. You suspect we've a mole? "Love Home, Adoption" You need something? Why did you leave me a card? I don't know... I just want to see you again. Why? You don't want to see me? Then why are you here? Have we met before? Just that night at the hotel. Other than that night, have you ever been to a seaside cafe? What difference does it make? Let's go eat. Where to eat? Up ahead. Thanks. Thanks. You like spicy food? He did. Who's he? Sorry. I always order these dishes. Order something else not spicy? I can't eat spicy food before, but now I can. You remind me of him. My fiance died a week before our wedding. I have been to a seaside cafe. It was there he proposed to me. I can still feel he's right here beside me. Don't drink, it's cold. - Never mind. - Let me heat it up. You're late! I found this pill today. Check it out tomorrow. Ok. I'll call you when I find out. Don't mind me. I head to work. "Sherman Ko, Taiwan villa" John. Quick learner, I'm only 5 minutes late. What have you got? I followed your lead, I found 2 cases in Asia in the past 18 months that matched the General's M.O. One in Myanmar, one in Australia. But back then we were so certain General was in HK, we did not include them in our files. Say this is Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar and Australia. What do you mean? '7 Stars Encounter', a chess composition. I think this is the General's ultimate goal. To kill 7 people based on this composition. 2 more to go. But the odd thing is... Sherman Ko is not supposed to be in here. So? Where are you going? Sherman's hospital. John Is the Director here? I just came back. How can I find him? Sorry. I have things to do. Excuse me. "Ciclosporin" Hi, John. The pill you gave me is anti-rejection drug after a liver transplant. I'll be home for dinner. What? I'm talking about the pill, I'll pick you up after work. Hey John? John, what's up Jack, find a place alone. Ok. Look up Calvin Che's medical records. Don't ask and don't let anyone know. OK. John Ma, we need to talk. Professor! A rematch? As a kid, I always save the best for last. We need a special day for our rematch. I'll wait. What's the matter? You want to know about me? You'll tell me you're fine. Like you, I'd a transplant. You've a new heart, I've a new liver. I had advanced liver cancer. Either I get a new liver transplant or I die. I still have a lot to do. And the family... You know the drill. Yes. We both had a close call. I meant to tell you this. We are in the same boat. We had a transplant, but not the same case. Any rejection? No. It was good. How about psychologically? Sorry. Hello John! No, I'm eating with Professor Che. Something about the Professor. Last March he had advanced liver cancer. His attending doctor was Sherman Ko. I see. We'll talk later. They say a donee is likely to inherit the host's emotions after the transplant. Cellular Memory? Do you feel differently after your transplant? Or any change? What about you? Physically, severe organ rejection is fatal. As a friend, I tell you acceptance is the best way to solve psychological problems. Or you will die. You accepted it? I did notice one change. Suddenly I like spicy food. Are you addicted? No, it's under control. I just figured out that saying about the abyss. There's no need. You're the abyss. Unfathomable. Really? Hi, Hong Kong! I'm the General. I'm back from Hell to punish sinners of this world. Thai profiteer Chok Na Long is next. John Ma, you beat me once. Let's play another game. The best of one set match. If you catch me before I kill again, I'll go back Hell. If not, remember that John Ma killed Chok therefore more people will die because of him. 3 hours ago, the Thai Police has confirmed Chok Na Long received a chess piece. He has a praying ceremony for his family tomorrow General is likely to make his move then. Can we ask him to cancel? We warned him, but he insisted with Buddha's blessing, he's not afraid of the General. Can we seal off the streets, turn off the traffic lights. I doubt if he could get in. I object. I think we should do nothing. John, we have a job to do. I know. Remember 'Tempting the Tiger'? Whoever gets hooked first will win. I disagree. You were almost killed last time. We're policeman, not Superman. I agree with Ma Sir. Since the new General showed up, we can't back down. We lose if Chok dies. Same if the new General gets away. So if we want to win, we must catch him first. But I think... Sorry, Madam Ho. A life is more important than anything else. The General obviously wants revenge. You should stay in Hong Kong. Madam Ho, I want the Professor and Jack in Thailand to help the Thai Police for me. All the more reason for me to go! Don't even think about it! If John doesn't show up the General may change his plan. Sorry, Professor! I've made up my mind. This is an INTERPOL case, John Ma is staying, understand? Yes sir. Any questions? That's it. Did you see that? Sir, what is it? Rewind... zoom in. Keep going! OK, stop! What is he doing here? Sorry, Sir! Why is he here? Ma Sir asked me a favor, I... Shut up! Tell him to come here. Now! Yes, Sir. John, Captain Ko wants to see you now. I'm on vacation. Leave me alone. But Captain Ko said... Give me that! John, you'll wreck our plan! Captain Ko... It's them. Who? The Balong Gang, Chok's arch enemy. We're in big trouble if we can't shake them. John, get over here I'll take Chok to safety. Too late! Tell him to come over, OK? Yes, Sir. Chok. Professor! What's going on? Ma Sir abandoned his position. What? Scale down this area for me. Look like a chess board? 7 Stars Encounter! The General will kill Chok based on this. Thailand is where the "rook" is... Captain Ko is heading that way! Tell Captain Ko, and I'll call John. John, tell Captain Ko to change his route. The General plans to intercept Chok. If Captain changes his route, we never get chance to catch him. Lives are at stake! Punish the sinners of the world. Thai profiteer Chok Na Long is next. John, don't be reckless! Get out! Let's go, Boss! Get in! Go to Hell! Can't reach Captain Ko. Get in! Turn! Go straight! General! Ma Sir, we meet again! Are you the elder or younger one? We are twins! No difference. We took turns going to school under one name. We are of the same mind! Let him go! I'll entertain you! You still don't understand our faith. Revenge? Come to me. Let him go! My brother was my only family in the world. The world is Hell after you killed him. Based on the evidence in hand, the case of the General, the international serial killer is now closed. The killer Sheldon Chiang, the twin of Herald Chiang, a.k.a the General, was certified dead. Milton Ko of the INTERPOL was killed in action. We wish to convey our deepest condolences and gratitude to the officers in this operation. What you got? Sorry. I checked Sheldon's entry and exit records. Look, He wasn't in Taiwan when Dr. Ko was killed. - How did you know? - What? Yes. I've also checked the Special Task Force. When Sherman Ko was killed, the only person who was in Taiwan was Calvin Che. Are you sure? Positive! What now? Should we tell Madam Ho? Let's keep digging. Sue. John. Remember our cruise on New Year's eve? I got the tickets. Yes, let's talk about this later... Can you look up someone for me? Sure. Thank you. I really thought it was General. After all, I'm the criminal psychologist. Trust your instincts. I know you're big on logic. To save face, men often pretend nothing is wrong. You should know. Sue, what have you got? You're right, there's no record of Calvin Che's transplant. He probably got a liver in the black-market. Judging from the time, I suspect the liver... belonged to... the General. Are you sure? Pretty much! Look at this... His rehabilitation record. His admission recorded that he had organ rejection. Then he was transferred for psychological reasons. Like what? Latent propensity for violence. When he was sleepwalking, he almost killed his wife. I see. Thank you. Leaving? Ms. Chan, I'm coming. I just finished over here. I maybe a bit late. Sorry. "King Cheung" Ko, I don't feel so good after the transplant. Let's talk straight. You're dead if I didn't save you. Because of you, I'm still on the run. Whose liver did you give me? The General's. The General? I almost strangled my wife! So? What do I care? "General's grave" You're my brother's friend? So yours is captured. This is Prof. Che come to help you. Look at me! He's gone... I can never talk to him again. Smoking will kill you. I can't take your call right now. Please leave a message. Remember what I said? Trust your instincts. A bad organ must be removed. Or it will kill. Sheldon is dead. John Ma killed him. John Ma killed Sheldon. John Ma also killed the General. But you fell in love with him. "I need to see you, Sharon." What's so important? No rush. Have some tea. 4 years ago, after I graduated from college I travelled around Taiwan alone. You know my car broke down, there was no one around. When I was in despair, he came. At first sight, I knew he was the man I have been waiting for. "Sheldon Chiang, Sharon Chan" Then we started dating. "Don't abandon him if you love him" At the seaside cafe, he taught me to play chess. I made cakes for him, and had spicy hotpot with him. Until one day, he proposed to me. My fiance was... the General. You... You killed him. It's destiny. You risked life to catch bad guys. He risked life to punish sinners. And I risked life for love. You're so much like him. I'll give up anything for him. Goodbye! Take him away. Yes, Madam. I had advanced liver cancer. Either I get a liver transplant or I die. I still have a lot to do. And the family... Daddy, I know you are the best. I will do anything to make you happy. Yes? Have you seen them? They live in 2A. Ms. Yip and her daughter? They left this morning. Where did they go? I don't know. They left in a hurry with 2 suitcases. I hope they're not in any trouble. What trouble? I don't know. A cop came by earlier. Ma Sir is over there. Thank you. Where is my wife? How would I know? What did you tell her? You inherited the General's violence. So you treated your wife like that. You deny no feeling for Sharon? I'm different from you! We're the same! I won't kill. Definitely not to cover up a crime. But Sharon is dead. You killed her! I didn't. I truly admired her. Her death helped accomplish so much. You're mad! I know you won't tell me where my wife is. Time for our last game. What do you mean? Come out then you'll know. "King" Hello? Hello? What time is it now? 11:30 PM Don't move! Sorry, pal! Go faster! Welcome to the New Year's Eve Party! Applause for GBS JP Dr. King Cheung! Go faster! We're stuck. A prisoner got away at Hung Hom Tunnel! He is John Ma, a former RCU Inspector. He's in possession of a Police gun. He is wanted by the Police armed and dangerous. How to defuse the bomb? You're late for our rematch? You only have 10 mins left. Tell me how! Be patient! Or you'll lose. Our game has just begun. Look over there. Guess there are 50,000 people or 100,000? What can I make you to quit? Answer my question. Where did you go wrong? It was believing in you. It was believing in yourself. You think you're upholding justice. King Cheung and his lot killed countless child labors in SE Asia. You think the law could save him? Maybe the law is useless, but you can't punish them by killing innocent people! Ko and Sharon are dead because of you! John, you're one step away. We can see justice served, our way. I'm different from you! I'm a cop! Of course we're different. I killed the bad guys. You killed the good guys. Surrender. They came for you. Such a lively party tonight, I invited a special guest to join us. People are afraid to make choices. Because when it comes, they must face up to their true selves. When I got my gift from Sheldon Chiang, I decided it's best to let you end it all. Bro must love the fireworks this year. Between a bad guy and your woman. Choose one. I'll then key in the password to save the other. When the time is up and you can't decide... Boom... they all die. Jack, you're the I.T. genius, can you defuse both bombs? Even a genius needs time. I can't stop the bombs in such a short time. The best I can do is cut off its remote so he can't detonate ahead of time. I surrender. I surrender. Madam! I don't expect to save 100,000 lives. Let me save just one. Madam! You win! Sue! It's OK, Sue! Sue! What did you do? What did you do? Can't make a choice? John, don't shoot. I just helped you. John! Shoot! No password then. Sorry... What are you doing? John What are you doing? Are you crazy? You took 100,000 lives! 100,000! I don't get it. I already gave you the password! Rematch... get it? What's the date today? December 31! You're completely insane. Congratulations! I'm so touched! 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... Happy New Year! Have a great year! Not to save 100,000 lives but one. You win! Ma wanted me to cut off the remote control 10 secs before the countdown. Then put up an explosion scene on the screen. I already gave you the password! Rematch! I trust you. The ambulance has micro communicators. December 31. The password is 1231! John, good job! A call for you. My daughter. Hey, how are you? Dad, it's me! Happy New Year! Thanks for the present. I've been having so much fun! Present? Go finish your homework. Hi, Mrs. Che. Katy, right? I'm John Ma, HK Police. I'd like to speak to you about Prof Che. Daddy? Where is he? Don't be rude, Katy. Something wrong? No. He has several cases on hands pretty swamped. He asked me to bring you these cruise tickets. See? I knew Daddy didn't forget. This is from him? Mom, I want to call Daddy. Why don't you call him after you get off the cruise? Say happy New Year to surprise him. Daddy... are you still there? I'm right here. Daddy, I want to tell you, wherever you are and whatever you're doing, you'll always be my super hero! I love you. I love you too. Mom has something to say to you. Mommy? Calvin Happy New Year. Happy New Year. "Sharon Chan, died December 30, 2015" They said you were calm when they found you. Why? You know how much Sharon loves the General? How much? She went on living for him and kept his faith. Because she believed General's heart will always beat for her. I believe in you too. I won't give them away. It's for us this time. OK. You are playing with a person, not a chessboard. Look at your opponent or you'll definitely lose. I never said I've to win. Checkmate! The General is dead. Game over. One game finishes is for another new game to start. Is winning really that important? Yes! I'm Calvin Che. John Ma. Rematch! It's just beginning. General is the same as Calvin. They think they're supermen. If we do it that way, do you think it will be like murder? Not yet... You know the drill. Unfathomable. I can still feel he's right here beside me. The accomplice you're talking about is just in your imagination. Any other things you've imagined? - At least 30% is true. - As if you never lie! You're one step away. We can see justice served, our way.
