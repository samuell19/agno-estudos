- That was a long time ago, so long ago, and yes, it wasn't there at all. However, if it were not I wouldn't remember about it. In some kingdom, in some state the peasants left to go to war. When I was born I was 7 years old my father was not born, my grandfather was not married. Here, then we lived richly. Poles broke from nakedness to barefoot. There were copper utensils with a cross and a button. Horned cattle cockroach to insect. We have a big hut yard ring, three poles, end by end. Three stakes are hammered, three twigs are curled, covered by the sky and shrouded in light. And we had land, land and don't cast an eye. The oven and the benches, they themselves sifted. And the floor and the chambers were rented out in loans. Grozhe, because they are all baptized. - Here, Mavra Ivanovna, we are doing a good deed to you. With matchmakers, they say you have a groom, and we brought you a bride. There is a groom, but what kind of bride is that? - And here, Nastasya Ivanovna, look. What a beauty. Grandpa's helper. - What are you, honey? - My wife is solid, you can see it for three miles - slender, tall, about a week tall. And two days of bending. - Get up, get up, do you hear? - How do people care about their economy. I would go to the market, I would sell something. I would buy different gifts for my wife, some poor commodity. Would whitewash and blush. Well, what are you standing for? - But, went, but. - Where? Stop. Stop, they tell you. Stop, listen. Where is our cow from the yard, Lord. - If they play music, then bald. Going to the market - wait to count the gaps. - Wow, honey, bastard! - Thank God, little by little I began to get hold of. I sold the house - I bought a gate, I'll lock myself up. - Idl, rake it out of your own house. Look, good people, what a thief has come out. Here's the hubby get out of the yard who has a worse mind borrow. And don't go home crazy. - On the streets of shame, the wife sold her husband. Yes, I took it cheap, a penny by the spoon, Yes, a mallet in the neck. They don’t know how to work, to harness the lollipop. They don’t know how to sit down at the table, they don’t know how to eat porridge. - What's your name? - I do not know. - ABOUT, I returned from distant countries, I met "I don't know". - Give me your mind. - How many do you need? - How much will you pay? - How many do you need. - How much do you need? - Well, how many ladies. - And how much will you give? - Well, as much as you need - so many ladies. - Come on, hold. Use my mind. What? Here I am at home. - Oh, old friend. - Well, how did my mind help you? What are you, offended by something? Come on, come on, you hear. Eh, brother, you can’t buy happiness and intelligence, and don't borrow. - Did you get there? - And the Tsarevo taught me with ramrods. War-fool brought to mind, paths with a bayonet to kortechev. Again, this was the case. They cut off my head in battle and our doctors were stupid, took the goal that lay closest yes and stuck. So, since then I have been wandering around the world - toiling. I don't know my house. - Where are you now? - Yes, I'm going, I'm still inhabited, where milky rivers flow in jelly banks. The bell stands there pancake covered and locked up. And in the church, the images are all gingerbread. Acodiles all - apple. - Listen, take me with you, huh? - Yes, you know, everyone has their own stitch path. - How far to go? - Go straight ahead, and you'll get there. Wait you listen, you Note life. So what do you see or hear? Remember. Tie a knot for memory. Well you look like that and you will wise up. Although, hardly. - We are not like you, and there is much to be proud of. As in our village, the shores are jelly, drunken rivers flow. Gingerbread trees grow on trees and on the bushes there are pies and spittles. - Where are you going? - Where the rivers of milk flow in sour shores. - You, baby, need to get married. - Yes, I had a wife, but now I don't. - These people need an eye and an eye. But mine is always with me, do you want to show me? - Come on, help. - Come on, come on, come on. - Listen, let's go along the milky rivers, huh? - Our roosters sing and we are not allowed to sleep, but your hens sing and the roosters don't get free. We are not like you have something to brag about. We have a big family don't sip milk. You can't take a spoon look, you can see the bottom of the cups. - ABOUT, serviceman, Well, what did you find your kissel banks? - I found it. - Well well. - And what did you get? - Where? - Yes from. - M, on. - Yes, you're sick. He needs to be treated. Do you have a doctor? And here I am - the best doctor, treat young children. Do not moan, do not scream, lie quietly. I am a famous staff doctor. Healer, horseman, baker and pharmacist from under the bridge. I have talent I can heal. I heal the dead. You are still a small brother if he did not cut firewood I didn’t like girls, I didn’t drink beer until light. Where do you know everything that is going on in the world, how arable land marries plow. - What is he clucking to? - Yes, he says, here I am - a foreign king. "Whoa." "Whoa." - Help, help. - That's how it was, my sirs, the battle with Aunt Natalia. Their Turks are falling like chocks. And our eagles will fly, although they stand without heads, yes tobacco sniff. - Ai lost his forehead falcon? - Yes, I'm looking for the promised land, where milky rivers flow in jelly banks. - Ugh, I'm sorry God. - ABOUT. - Hey, how far has the compatriots gathered? "To heaven." - А. - Where where? - To the promised land. - Well, are there milk rivers in the jelly banks there? - Everything is there. - Listen, soldier, there we go there. - Come on, come on, come on. Come on, let's go, let's go. - Well, where are you? - Come on, let's go. - Well? - No, I'm going to milk rivers. - Well as you know. - You ku... Where? Where are you going? And I? And I? What about me? Oops. "Hey. "Hey. - Hey, get down. - What are you? - What are you? - Do not be afraid, there will be enough for all jelly banks. -What if it's not enough? A? - Yes, it is difficult for our brother to climb into the sky. And even harder when to sit down. - Came back. "Oh. And where did it take you? - So I went to the milky rivers, to the jelly banks. A poplar tree stands there, covered with a drynock, locked in a chute. In the church, the image is all gingerbread, and the kotila something all apple. He went to hell, he drove the devils there. Been to paradise however, he did not choose a place more beautiful than his native home. - Painfully much you have become on the tongue. - I miss you so much. - Listen, godfather da godfather, get smart with your grandfather. I have a house, it weighs upside down on a stake, doors into the water, where I don’t go. There is a garden at the house and a winery in the garden. The wheels turn in steam, the intoxicating is offered for nothing. There are honey cakes here, but people live poor. Girls don't get married and even without husbands, girls will give birth well. "Be quiet there." - Can anyone know such a science, to melt the old into the young? Everyone knows me, they praise me in all places. Therefore, I reforge the old into the young. And I don't hurt my mind. Well, well... - I beg. - Let's. - Flies. "Oh. - Come on, turn me into a young one. - Why did it become, climb. - Oh, I can't. "Oh. Oops. Oops. Oops. - That was a long time ago, so long ago, which, by the way, was not at all. However, if it wasn't I wouldn't remember about it.
