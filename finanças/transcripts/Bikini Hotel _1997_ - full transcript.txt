[MUSIC PLAYING] Sammy. So what's the next part of breaking up? Chapter 2, making up. Listen, I'm sorry for accusing you of seeing someone else. Shh. No, but I-- Shh. Chapter 7, where it's like, I love you, I miss you, I'm sorry should be shown and not said. Uh-huh. Let me show you my words. Oh, teach me. Discipline me. Keep me after school. Well, let's see what you have for extra credit. You sure you're OK? Of course. Me hitting my head on the edge of the bed didn't-- it didn't hurt at all. Ah, what chapter was this? I should have believed you when you said she was just a friend. Mhm. Chapter 13, learn to trust. Mm, yeah, I like that chapter. Chapter 14, have faith. Mm, I live that chapter. Chapter 15. Mhm. Believe. Mm, I am that chapter. Oh. Ugh. Ow. Feeling better? Mm, no problem. It actually kind of broke my fall. I can still move it. See? Ow. Oh. Forgive me. Let's write a new book. Oh, I will. I will. Mm, I will. I will. Nicole. What did you say? I, uh-- I said-- I said not so. You said Nicole. Not Nicole as in my best friend Nicole. No, Sammy. Sammy. Samantha. Sam, we can still be friends. Don't start the rewrite now. Here's a footnote. Ow! Ugh. And the header. Ow. Oh. I love this show. It's so funny. [LAUGHS] Oh, I love it when you do your voices. [INAUDIBLE] Say, what's your name? I am Peggy. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, why don't you come over here, Peggy? I don't want to. I'm scared. Oh, yes, I am. Oh, yes, I am. I love it when you do your voices. [MUMBLING] No new taxes. My lips are reading. Is that all for me? Ouch. Oh! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! Oh, give me that moving violation. [GARBLED MUMBLING] Oh my god! My god! My god, I hate me! I love you. Oh. Oh, don't tease me when your meter's running. Oh, do your voices. Do it. It looks as if he has a monumental task ahead of him [MUFFLED GIBBERISH] My god, I hate me. I love you. Oh, yes, you do. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh! Right there, right there, right right there! Oh, right there! Let that go. Ow, ow, ow! Hey, Remote! Sty, uh, you alone? Yeah, it's changing my love oil by myself. BOTH: Work time! Nice, buns. Thanks. I just got them done. And look how firm they are. Hey! Hey. Mm! This is great. Just like a good man, nice and hard. Men are like snowstorms. You never know when they're coming or how many inches you'll get, and they're both flakes. Hell yeah. I guess old Brad is finito. Stucky, he is finito. Out of here. God. You guys have too much, too much potential to be just burger jockeys. One more year of night school and I'm done. I gotta get out of here. See you guys later. See you later. Bye. Hey, baby. Burger come with that shake? Do you know what they call the fat, ugly part around the sphincter? I don't know. That's the man. Hey, I wish you wouldn't have said that. Hey! Why don't you watch it, you half-baked bitch? Don't make me have to open up a can of whoop-ass in here. That's my sister you're talking to. Now how much would you pay for a knife like this? It slices, it dices, it makes julienned fries. But don't answer. There's more. You get this, this circumciser. It will cut those little pricks right down to size! So Sammy, you and Remote here are really brother and sister? We're half. Same mother. And Sty? She's a gypsy. I'm from Tustin. Sam Vance? I'm looking for Sam Vance, Mr. Sam Vance. I'm Samantha Vance. Oh, well, this is for you. Your father died earlier this year, and he left you that. The last will and testament of Ronald James Vance. He bequeathed the property on 1200 Beach Boulevard to Sammy Vance. A house? No, a hotel. Gas. Check. Oil. Check. Underwear. [INAUDIBLE]. Socks. Chicago. Going throttle up. Going with throttle up. Let's go. Move it or lose it. Let's go! Let's go! Ahh! [MUSIC PLAYING] No, no, no, no. How did you get in here? Leave, or I will call the police. This place is small change anyway. Yeah, make it a pepperoni, and make it quick! Hey. Sty, look at this. There you go. Does anybody work here? Hey! [CLAPS] Hey! May I help you? Yes, you can. What's your name? Tristan. Well, Tristan, you're fired! Now give me back my jacket. Come on! The mortuary needs it back. Dorks. Please excuse the guys. We're just excited. Yes, ma'am. Is there something I can help you with? Yes. I think I own this wonderful place. You're looking for Beach Boulevard 1300. This is 1200. The building you're looking for is across the street. Oh, sorry. I'm going to miss you. Sorry. REMOTE: We don't want the place anyway! [MUSIC PLAYING] Iki is right. It's all right, sister. It's a shock at first, but it'll be fine, I think. This place is hell on earth. You know what? Let's burn it, all of it. I can't go back to Palmdale and tell everyone my old man's place is a dump. What do you say we go check it out? Yeah. Ew, gross. Oh god. [TOILET FLUSHING] [LAUGHTER] The toilet is broken. Oh, yeah. So what's the plan, Hannibal? Well, the letter says we go back to the Hotel Regency tomorrow morning to meet with some people, some real estate people about the deed. OK. Well, looks like we're checking into our own hotel. Let's party, huh? Party with babes and beer, and babes and beer, and babes, and food, and beer, and babes. And I'm going to get a towel. Well, sis, what's it going to be? Are you going to sell the place? Sell, sell, sell. Or are you going to keep it? Keep, keep, keep. Time is ticking on you. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. OK, time's up. What will it be? Keep the roach hotel. Keep the roach hotel. I don't understand it. Why would my father let this place go? Why would he let you go? [LIGHT SOBS] Hey, there you are. What are you doing? Oh, I couldn't sleep. Me neither. I just never owned anything like this before. I mean, all this is mine. It just blows my mind. Well, don't worry about it. I mean, you've got a great office with fish on the wall. I mean, not that many people can be that lucky. Look, you're going to be the boss. You're going to be the queen of the Tiki Hotel. Would Mademoiselle like to have her bags carried upstairs? Yes, I would. [RINGING BELL] Uh, take Mrs. Smith up to room 5C. OK, really, you can't do it like that. These are minimum wage employees, a little stronger. OK. Take Mr. Jones up to room 5D. Yeah, that's good. But where are the bags? Huh? Huh? SAMMY: Who are you? Manfred, miss. Just Manfred. I'm here, the only employee of the Tiki Hotel. Mr. Vance told me that as long as he was alive, I had a place to stay. He said that? He did, miss. I'm sorry to have to tell you, Mr. Manfred, but my father is dead. I suspected. But will he be back? Uh, no. I'm his daughter, Sammy. And this is my half brother, Remote, and our half friend, Sty. My pleasure. Look, Mr. Manfred. Tomorrow we're supposed to see some people about the place. I understand, miss. When I heard the bell ring, I thought the boss was back. My mistake. Good night, miss. Welcome home, miss. Bye bye. That was the walking dead. [GIGGLING] As I was saying, Chip, the running of the hotel goes to Jacqueline. But Mother, I thought that-- This is not a discussion. Get that eye sore from across the street as our extended parking lot. Don't pay over $20,000 for it. The Burdocks from Australia are flying here today to tour the Regency. That extended parking lot will help grease the deal. Why sell it at all? You said something, Chip? Yeah. Why sell the Regency at all? I mean, just because you're bored with it, Mother, it doesn't mean it's useless. Father loved this place. It still makes a profit. It's a city institution-- Chip was just expressing his concern for not getting the best price on the Regency, ma'am, hm? Bullshit, Jackie, but nice try. I'm late for my appointment with Prince Charles. Call me in the jet if you need to. Don't need me, understand? Yes, Mother. You are so sweet to think of your dear father. But remember, she who is on top will always win. Muah. Muah. Chip, Chip, Chip, how many times must I tell you? Don't argue with your mother. Smile. Nod. Then when she leaves for one of her junkets, we do what we want. I just don't see why I can't run the Regency. I mean, I've done it. Before you joined the staff, I was the guy enough confident. [MUSIC PLAYING] Wee. Wee. Wee. Wee. Ah! Uh, uh, that's Chinese. It's very old. It's very expensive. What, this? Chinese, huh? Must be Tiananmen. Here you go. Whoa! Fly, horsie, fly! Mr. Sam Vance. Sam? I'm Jack, Jacqueline Renee. [CLEARING THROAT] Um-- um, look, we called for this meeting, uh, because we're aware of your inheritance. And we are offering you $20,000 in cash for the Tiki Hotel. Sis, $20,000? Take it. I mean, you don't even have to play the pyramid. Think about it. We could party, and party, and sing, and dance, and surf, and party all night long. Of course. You're surfers. It all makes sense now. What do you mean by that? Nothing. It's none of my business. $20,000 in cash might be all the money they ever see their entire lives. So you three must have been voted most likely to succeed in school, hm? Well, I-- I was. You did graduate from high school, didn't you? Is Nixon still president? Uh! You got. Why are we dawdling here? Take the money. Spend it. Smoke it. Eat it. BOTH: Smoke it. Drink it! I don't care, but take it and let's move on. We feel like it's a fit-- Wait a minute! Keep your smug mouth and your 20,000. I'm not selling. You're joking. Yeah, we are. Joking, right? The only joke in this room is you. And in case you didn't notice, you lose. Ungrateful, useless nobodies. [SNEEZES] Sis, what's up? It was $20,000 back there. Most uncool. I mean, you blew it, man. Yeah. We can fix up the place and run it. We can. STY: You're bonkers. There's no way we can do this. This place? You want us to work here? You've got to believe! STY: I don't believe what I'm hearing here. It's not going to work. Look, we don't need her $20,000. We can do better than that. Come on, guys. We believe in each other, right? Well, I-- I could-- I could spackle-- spackle for something, right? What are you going to do? I guess I could shower. Hey, huh? And I could put some plants around, green up the place a little. I know we can do it. I know it. I want to try. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] You care about my old man. Why? He was very ambitious, and he worked himself very hard. But down deep, he was good people. I know you don't share those feelings. If you'd like, I'll turn the picture over. No, no, no. That's OK. Let it stay where it is. [DISTANT SCREAMING] It happens like clockwork. What is it? The voice of despair. Then you haven't heard me. [MUSIC PLAYING] All this work for nothing. We still have no customers. Well, what are we supposed to do? Well, think of something. I got it. We could sacrifice a virgin. Yeah. OK, I'm not dying for this hotel. I got it! We could kill somebody. Yeah? Once again, I am not dying for this hotel. Hey, let's open a gay bordello. Hey, how about that death thing? Quit clowning around. Come to our hotel. Hey, how are you doing, boy? Here. You want a room cheap? [INAUDIBLE] I'll let you touch my balloon. What did I say? What did I do? Hi. Hi. Fuck off, guys. Free room. Let me try. Here you go, sir. Take one. Sir, anybody? Here you go. Sir, here you go, sir. I should take a card. Take a card, what are you doing? Here you go. Why don't you dump these clowns and go out with a real man, huh? Huh? What did you just say, man? I'll cut your throat! Hi. Oh, god. So, how's it going? Great. Really good, just great. Good. Good. Listen, I-- I-- I wanted you to know that the meeting and the offer that was made, some of the things that were said, I-- [BEEPING] Um, I've gotta go. Maybe I'll see you later, huh? Is this a bad hair day or what? I'm packing it in. But first I'm getting out of this nasty outfit. She's bummed big time, man. You know what? I think this requires the first Tiki Hotel raging party. Yes. Thank you. God. I almost have a degree from night school. Yeah. I'm better than that Jacqueline. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course. Oh, yeah. I can run a hotel with brother and company. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, Los Angeles Wait, speed bumps. I don't know. Where are you-- America is a great country! Hey, you going to the party at the Tiki? Come on, it's party time. Party on, dude! [MUSIC PLAYING] So then they sent me to Vietnam. And of course, being a munitions expert, I told them, look. There's nothing much I can bring my own crew. So I spent seven years there, seven long years, sister, this high in mud and gook and soot. Then I met this soldier-- Want to hear how I was kicked out of the Cub Scouts? Hey. Hey. You want to touch my broccoli? [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. [INAUDIBLE] You remember, I met you over in [INAUDIBLE] Barbecue Grill. Where? Uh, splash. No. Oh, Tony Steakhouse. No. Uh, it's over at the donut shop right off the highway. Remember, I saw-- I [INAUDIBLE] your coffee. No. Remember, I put mustard on your hot dog. You want to touch my cauliflower? No. Please? Come on. Please? [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, let me try. I'm a licensed scuba diver. It won't hurt me. Hey. [BELL RINGING] Hey. We need a room. We want the room. How much? We don't have any more room. We tried to make it. But we have no hotel anymore. So get out of here, Ping and Pong. How much? Look, I told you. Take the chopsticks out of your ears. OK, OK, I'll tell you what-- $1,000 each. Wow. You must think we were just jumping off our [INAUDIBLE].. Don't talk [INAUDIBLE] to me. No way Jose. Sure. That would be cool. Go on ahead, name an aircraft carrier. Well, that was the end of it, and-- hey. Why are all these people here? One last bash before we got to go. Look, why don't you go get wasted, huh? Already wasted. Getting some air. [SNORING] OK. I'm here, so show me. Show her, Sty. Huh? Huh? Huh? I don't understand. Who, what, why? The bikini broads. You know, the party girls with their bahow and their bing. They bring money, and they're babes. And you know, money babes. Babe moneys. You made this place into a house of sin? Look. We show them a smile, a pretty face. We sell the shizzle without the steak. Nice metaphor, dude. And you think these women will work for Bikini Hotel? Oh, yeah. I mean, gee, I loved working Bikini Hotel. There goes every dream I've ever had. I have no self esteem. Told you. So it says here, Eunice, you're an executive secretary? Yes, I can do five different word processing programs, two spreadsheets, and database work. What makes you want to join our staff here at the Tiki Hotel? It's your dress code. I'm a nudist. [COUGHING] All right. You said you, um, were a n-- n-- nud-- nud-- Nudist. You see, this job is a way of expressing my lifestyle. I believe the human body is beautiful, and I can also get a tan while I work. I think it's beautiful, too. I-- Beautiful. I love you-- your body. Love and you worship. Could we see you in a swimsuit? Guys, what do you think? BOTH: Welcome aboard. And why do you want to join us here at the fabulous Tiki Hotel? Well, it beats wet t-shirt contests and mud wrestling. You're goddamn right it does. You could be a waitress in our fabulous bar. Oh. Well, I was kind of hoping for something maybe more in the supervisory position. Well, what kind of experience do you have? Not too much, but I am very dominant. Whoa. Well, judging from your resume and the fact that you haven't been able to keep a job longer than two weeks, what makes you think you have what it takes to move on to our bonus round, where the money is double, but the stakes are higher? Bonus round, bonus round, bonus round. Why don't I just show you guys? Huh? - Yeah. Fine. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, yes. Slap your butt again and again. Water. Water. OK, ladies. Welcome to Room Service Training 101. I am Sty. Now, first off, we have candy. Manfred? Outstanding, Manfred. You don't have to worry about ringing up the prices. We have Scantron-- Scantrons for you. Welcome to Room Service Training 101. I am Sty. OK, don't worry about having to do anything. We have the technology to take care of everything, so you don't have to use your brains. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING] Room service. Hey. Hey, man. Hey. Hey, look. Look. [INAUDIBLE] What? Is it hot? Oh, it's hot. Geronimo! [KNOCKING] WOMAN: Housekeeping. That was excellent. Thank you? Did I ever mention about the worst blowjob I ever had? No. It, too, is excellent. [BELL RINGS] Ah, oui. Available-- you has a room available? Yes. Yes, we do. Would you like one? Uh, oui, oui, yes. Uh, before I do, do you have swimming pool? Do you want a sweaty pool? No, no, no, swim. You know, swim. Oh, swimming. Yeah, we have a rusty pool out back. Ah, good, and your hotel, does your hotel have the tennis? No, we have no more tetanus anymore. No, no, no, no. You know, the tennis. Oh, tennis, yeah. You could hit your balls against the back wall if you want. And does your hotel, does it have the gym-- gym-- gymnasium? Jim's gone. No, no, no. You know, gym, gymnasium. - Oh, gymnasium! - Oui. Yeah. Well, you could lift up aluminum cans, you know, like 12 ounces at a time. Tres bien. Tres bien. Very good. I take the room. OK, will it be a double or a single? [SNEEZES] This is interesting. All the reservations last night were canceled. Well, that's not very good, is it? No, it's not. What's going on, Chip? Why were all the reservations last night canceled? I don't know. I don't run the Regency anymore, remember? Oh. Do I detect a note of petulance? Is Chippy angry? No, Jacqueline, not angry. Just pointing out that it's not my job anymore. So you don't care. You're the general manager. You figure it out. I'm just a glorified secretary now. I mean, maybe you'd like to dicta-- tate to me. Mm. Don't stop. You're so sexy when you fight back. I could run this hotel better than you in my sleep. You don't deserve this. I do. Oh. Not yet. No? No. You deserve to be punished. I do? Oh, yes. Mm, for all those mean and nasty things you just said about me. I do. I do. By the way, we're getting married. Your mother approves. Wait, wait. What? What? [BUZZING] Oh, damn it. We'll talk about this later. Jacqueline, wait, wait. Jacqueline. Keys? I almost forgot. Uh, Jacqueline. Uh, Jackie, wait, please? Help? There's Jackson. There's Tim. That's what they've been doing on their bowling nights, hey? But Edna, that doesn't explain why Tim got more money in his pocket than when he started. I was curious. All right, you guys. Now you play just like regular poker, right? BOTH: Yes. Yes. But every time you lose a hand, throw in a dollar and take off a piece of clothing. That's no fair. I only have a pair. Oh, and what a nice pair you have. But oh my, the king is back. Oh. Oh ho ho. Oh, yeah. Life is hard. Oh, yeah. Did you see what Rye was wearing last night? I didn't think it was very cute. Just a minute. Can we use the phone? Can't you see that I'm busy? I thought she worked here. [KNOCKING] [LAUGHTER] Hey sailor, how about a naval salute? Oh. [SCREAMING] So you're the screamer. Yeah, you caught me in a private moment, not that I have many. I'm sorry. I'll leave. I'm sorry. No, don't. Stay. I mean, I was kind of hoping we were going to get a chance to meet without, you know, our clothes on, um, you know, my-- my business suit and your, uh, feather thing. You scream on schedule, don't you? Yeah. Um, not a clock. I just work like one. You like walking in the grass with your bare feet? Yeah. It calms me. Me, too. Actually, I like taking long walks on the beaches and through nice parks. But what really calms me is-- Ice cream? Snow cones. [CHUCKLES] Snow cones. Snow cones. Um, you want to get one? OK. OK, great. Oh, Mr. Sty. Sty. Mr. Simon Ko, president of Ko Electronics and Worldwide Distribution, wants to hold an international convention here at the Tiki Hotel. Mr. Ko, that would be great. We'd love to-- Sty, please, allow mois. Yeah, bitching. We are losing business. And do you know why? Um-- Sex. The Tiki Hotel is using sex to book its customers. That's terrible. That's-- Brilliant. Why didn't we think of it first? [INAUDIBLE] could have known. The Australians are coming, and we can't sell them a four star hotel if it doesn't have any customers. Don't you think? Well, she's right. She's right of course. Shut up. I will fight fire with fire. Gentlemen, the Hotel Lingerie. Chip is the owner of the hotel. Have you discussed it over with him? Where is he? Hm? I don't know. I don't know either. I mean, I inherited a hotel, which is great, but I never knew my father. He just took off and left. My mom and dad were always around. I mean always. You know, I was never by myself. It was either them or butlers, nannies. You know, that may sound great, but I never had time for myself to myself ever. And now of course there's Jacqueline. Your girlfriend, huh? I was just informed that she's my fiance. It's funny. That word, fiance, when I think of Jacqueline, it becomes finance. Marriage is like a hurricane. At first, there's a lot of sucking and blowing. But you lose your house in the end. That's good. It's eclectic, but it's good. Different. Yeah. Love is like a hurricane. Could you spare two hours for the best hamburger in the world? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. OK. I am sending you a spy. We have a defector. I want details on their finances. Get them by any means necessary. No problem. I've already planted the seeds, and now it's in harvest. Damn. What the hell's going on in here? Don't play games with me. I've seen you following me around. I have? You've felt it, haven't you? Well, I did feel a slight disturbance in the force. Now feel this. Oh, I guess I have to fold. Me, too. Me, too. [LAUGHS] WOMAN: That's good. I guess that means you guys are going to have to take a piece of your clothing off now, too. PLAYER 1: Woo. PLAYER 2: Oh, yeah. Hey, she's a legend, kid. One of her burgers can change your life. Mm. Mm. Mm. It's great. It is great. It seriously this is like the best burger I've ever had. As a matter of fact, I would like another one. Good. You know, I was thinking. How do you think that we go a date? I just wanted more, you know? That's why I went to night school. I wanted to learn something. Hotel management. Restaurant management. Sort of the same thing, except with food. Yeah. You know, I always wanted to write. You know, I can do the hotel thing. I was raised to run it, and I can do it well. But when I write, it's like I got a wing span a mile wide. Anything is possible. I'm sorry. Ow. You OK? Yeah. Let's, um, try that again. OK. Oh, hang on a second. Ow. Oh. OK, [INAUDIBLE]. Hang on a second. [INAUDIBLE] I'm stuck. Come on. Ew, oh. [RIPPING] [POP] Oh, ow. OK, hang on. OK. Ow, sorry. Ow. Oh. Time out. Can we go outside? Please. What are you doing? No bears, no snakes, just you and me. Feel safer? Mhm. Anything can happen. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Is that the car? Is that the engine? Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. The keys, they're in the car. It's running. Oh god. Oh god. Check the back door. Sammy, no! [SHATTERING] These hand cuffs really aren't necessary, are they? Yes, they are. And right about now, I'd really like the password. Capiche? Damn your eyes, you dirty ape. I want to show you my spreadsheets and play with your heart, if only you'd give me the password. I'll never turn to the dark side, never. Ow. Ow. Sure about that? Huh? Huh? Huh? Did I ever tell you I was a pyromaniac? Wow, Money Penny. You're rather persistent. I can't give you the password. Come on. It's over. I want the password, and I want it now. All right! All right! I want it now! All right, the password is-- Don't do it! That whore is a spy. Thank god, the cavalry. Hi-ya. Most impressive. What's your style? White Crane. Yours? Monkey. Hi-ya. Kick her ass! Kick her in the face! [INAUDIBLE] [GRUNTING] [INAUDIBLE] Don't let them go. Great kungfu. Hi-ya. Hey, that's great. I'm proud of you guys. You got a key? See you, Sammy. Hey, call me when you recover. Don't ask. Good morning. How would you like to wake up at the crack of dawn? Who are you? I'm Dawn, and I work here. Tristan? Unbelievable. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] Won't cost [INAUDIBLE] Got change for a quarter? What have you do-- what are you doing? Running this hotel. Remember? I'm the one in charge. Yeah. Yeah. And you know what? You run it right into the dirt. I mean, hookers in the Regency? You made it immoral. Wake up and smell the coffee, Chip. We were losing out to that flea trap across the street. The Australians wouldn't stand for it, and your mother wouldn't stand for it either. So you make it into a common bordello? No, no, no. This is the exceptional bordello. Lucky bastard. Cause of death, a good time. As you can see, his heart gave out on him. His vallecular-- his epidural-- basically, he came and went. Jackson? Jackson? Where is he? Jackson. First, it was the Bikini Hotel. Then it was that Hotel Lingerie. I'm taking steps to see that they're closed. Out of my way! Judge, you never did know when to quit. Goddamn, my coat. So if we can just hold on, their bank note will be due? Yes, ma'am. Good. Even with all their success, they won't be able to match the 200,000 they owe in back taxes. No, ma'am. You did hide their records, didn't you, Tristan? It's locked in the office filing cabinet. I don't get it. Does this mean we win more talent show money or what? No, man. That's a $200,000 tax bill due by the end of next week that his people kept from us. My people? I'm the one that brought this to you guys. Guilty conscience, hey? I don't need this. I'm going back to the Regency. You can't go back there after what that woman has done to us. Sammy, I live there. It's my home. Look, you've been after the Tiki ever since we met you. I do you all a favor, and I get this grief? I mean, Sammy, how could you let him say these things after we-- After we what? It's my sister you're messing with, man. Don't make me cut you, bucko. Enough. Enough of this penny ante beating around the bush. Go home, Chip. Thanks for nothing. What's the plan, man? Face to face with the ice queen. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're upset, aren't you? No. You're a terrible liar. It breaks you up inside. Get used to it, honey bunch. Love is not pretty. You think about romance? Romance? Who has the time? Not me, and not you. We are a business partnership. Together, we double our stock, hm? What? Pay attention, Chip. Your mother will be expecting wedding plans soon, and I plan to give her the best I can think of. Let's cut to the chase. Lovely. You want our hotel, you've got to earn it. What would you like to do? Scissor, paper, rocks, thumb wrestling, a break dance contest. No, a steel cage match. That's it, a tournament. One on one, mano y mano, you will lose. If you win, I will leave town and the hotel is yours to make into a parking lot of value far beyond 20,000. Cool, but and if we win, you guys pay the $20,000 in back taxes. Yes, you do. It will be my pleasure to kick you out of town. Deal. Bye, Chiparino. I'm going to miss you. Sammy, Sammy, wait. Why are we fighting? What did I say? You have become the enemy. I'm fighting for my hotel. I'm fighting your fiance. I think that puts you on the other side. Whose? All right, that's it. That's really it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more nothing. If I'm the enemy, then let them beware because I'm hell on wheels. Little did they know that you were the state champion at Yale. We'll have that hotel by noon. Yeah. I just wish I could have chosen the course, though. I've never even heard of this one. Bitchin'. [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me. Ladies first. No, you go. Oh, no, no, no. You go. - No. - No. You go first. You go. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Fine. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! Aah! Yes! Woo! Yeah! Now due to allegations of solicitation and pandering-- Solicitation? Pandering? An injunction has been brought up by the Judge Thomas's widow against both hotels. I have been ordered to close down both hotels. What? I'll make an appeal. Oh. Tell me why there is an injunction against my hotel, Jacqueline. It says it is due to hookers and strange men in skirts and leather running around the hallways. Trying to find a niche market. The Australians won't come near us now. You blew it, sweetie. Get out. You-- you think I'm beat, huh? You're fired. You will never work in this business again. Chip? We're not together, Jacqueline. OK. OK. I'm leaving, and I'm not coming back. Mother, either I'm a part of your life, or I'm not. I would like to be a part of your life. I messed up, Manfred. A real failure. No, no, I don't think so, miss. In my opinion, you brought the Tiki back to life. Not for long. Do you know I remember when you were born? I was just a young fella working here. We were hosting two conventions. Your father was handling the reservation desk 24 hours straight. His work habits were very hard on your mother. Finally, she took you and left him. That's when things went bad for him. He went to pieces. Didn't care about anything anymore. That was because he loved your mother and you. I don't know about that. I do. It's something I discovered over years of dusting and cleaning, something I don't think he ever told anyone. He never forgave himself. It's me. I'll bet he gave you this place as a peace offering. And I blew it. No, I don't think so. By doing what you did, I believe you pardoned him for his sins. Anyway, you gave me a second chance. Thank you, miss. And good night. Hi. Hi. I was a jerk. Yeah. You were. And so was I, maybe worse. At least you were trying to help. You must be Sammy. You made my son very angry. He must be very fond of you. I'm Gail Regent. Hi, Mrs. Regent. Oh, call me Gail. We'll talk longer when I return. I'm off to Washington. Oh, by the way, I'll cover that loan for you for the back taxes on your hotel. But it's up to the two of you to decide how we're going to get back into business. The key is whether it's fair. Bye bye, Chip. Muah, muah. Pleasure meeting you, Sammy. Bye bye. When is love not like a hurricane? When the-- When the-- BOTH: --weather is fair. Have a good time, girls. You too, you old dog. Don't lose all your money. SAMMY: My brother and the cop became a nudist on the island of Maui. And he never watched another day of TV again. [MUSIC PLAYING] Raquel and Sty opened up a surf shop [INAUDIBLE] Salt Lake City. In their spare time, they teach White Crane and Monkey style kung-fu. The concierge became the chief interviewer for the Chip and Gail dance floors. Boy, is he ever happy. Jacqueline managed to get out of the hotel business and found work at Stucky's Burgers. Her burgers aren't so great. The first applicant for the manager of the hotel Regency was from the Tiki Hotel. The couple had a whirling courtship and were married while vacationing overseas. I expanded the hotel business into a franchise and opened a chain of burger joints named The King of Burgers. Chip became a screenwriter. His first movie was about a bikini hotel. [MUSIC PLAYING]
