(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic music) (pod exploding) - My name is Josh Kirby. I was just your average ninth grader. My biggest problem (chuckles) was getting good grades, and my idea of excitement was racing my bicycle. (bell ringing) Yes! I never thought time would catch up with me, but I couldn't have imagined (train horn blaring) that hundreds of years from now mankind would invent the Nullifier, a device capable of controlling or destroying the universe. - - [Irwin 1138] Prepare for the storm. - [Josh] A scientist named Irwin 1138 tried to disassemble and hide the Nullifier, but even he couldn't stop... - [Irwin 1138] Dr. Zoetrope. (lasers blasting) - [Dr. Zoetrope] Give me the Nullifier. - [Irwin 1138] You're too late, Zoetrope. - [Dr. Zoetrope] It's never too late for me. - Irwin and Zoetrope have been chasing each other across the time stream, trying to be the first to find the Nullifier's pieces. This time they're gonna land in 1995. The place, my front yard. Now I'm going along for the ride of all time. What's going on? Where are we? - [Irwin 1138] I hope you prepared to do battle, young man. This will be a war through time and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners. (pod exploding) - [Josh] We've got help from a warrior. - My name is Azabeth Siege. - Oh, she's amazing. - [Josh] And a magical creature called Prism to show us the way. Together we're on a quest through time, visiting different worlds to fight for the Nullifier's pieces. - [Dr. Zoetrope] I'm obviously in the right place and the right time. - Because of Zoetrope ever assembles the Nullifier, he'll conquer time itself. I've gotta try and save the universe. (triumphant instrumental music) I was just a 14-year-old kid before my adventure began, but now I'm Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. (uplifting instrumental music) (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (humming) - [Irwin 1138] Prepare for the storm. (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (dramatic music) (pulsing throb) Next. (electronic beeping) (pulsing throb) Next. (electronic beeping) (pulsing throb) Next. (pulsing throb) (dramatic music) (electronic beeping) (pulsing throb) We need another 93 seconds. Seal the door. (electronic beeping) (pulsing throb) Quick, load the final component. - [Man] Let's go. (door crackling) (door banging) - [Man] He's through! Back there! Let's go! - [Irwin 1138] Dr. Zoetrope. - [Man] It's him! Run! (lasers blasting) - [Man] Get out of there! - Ah, uh! - [Man] We can't hold him off! - [Man] Come on, we gotta get out of here! This way! There he is! - [Dr. Zoetrope] Give me the Nullifier component. - [Irwin 1138] You're too late, Zoetrope. - [Dr. Zoetrope] It's never too late for me. (lasers blasting) - [Irwin 1138] Oh! Ah! Oh! (electronic beeping) - In the name of all of creation, twisted old man, what have you done? (dramatic music) (clock buzzing) - Mmm. - [Dad] Movin' out, Josh. Breakfast is almost ready. (birds chirping) (soft instrumental music) - Morning, Dad. - Morning. - Morning, Genghis. Conquered a new kingdom while I was sleepin'? - Brain food, son. Drink up. - Dad, the calcium in milk's good for teeth and bones, not brains. - [Dad] Eh. How's the new watch holding up? - Guess. - Another one bites the dust, huh? - Yup. - What is it with you and watches, Josh? - I don't know. The school nurse said I had some screwy metabolism or something. My stopwatch still works, though. - Talk to that guidance counselor yet? - Dad, I'm already taking two advanced placement classes. My head's gonna explode. Yeah, I talked to the counselor. That's what I was studying for last night. The advanced placement chemistry test. I'm supposed to take that today. - Don't just take it, Josh. - I know, I know, don't just take it. Ace it. - Your mother would've been proud of ya. The two of you would've gotten along great. She was one smart lady. That's where you get your brains from, you know. - She was cute, too, right? - Not just cute. Beautiful. - See ya later, Genghis. (light playful music) - Josh, be careful. And ace that test. - No problemo, Dad. (light playful music) Yeah, ha ha! Rur, rur, yeah. Yeah! Woo-hoo! (upbeat pop music) Woo! Yeah! (upbeat pop music) Woo, woah, sorry. Woah, oh! Woah! (laughing) (bell ringing) And woah! Yes! Josh Kirby sets a new world record. Ah! - Aztecs were the dominant civilization of Mexico when Hernando Cortes invaded that country in 1519 under the auspices of the Spanish Empire. Yes, Joshua. - Ms. Mandelbaum, are we almost to the part where the Aztec priests rip out human hearts with their bare hands and eat 'em? (kids talking over each other) - Mr. Kirby, this is a G-rated history class. We will not be studying anything that is not rated G. - But Mrs. Mandelbaum, isn't history kind of made up of all ratings? From G to PG to PG-13 to even R? (laughing) (bell ringing) (kids conversing in background) - Yo, Josh man, Kirby man. That was incredible. What an amazing concept. R-rated history. Imagine ancient Rome babes dancing around in togas with grapes, man. With grapes! - I think Beth Sullivan thinks I'm weird. - Josh man, Kirby man, to all that cutting edge people here at Green Oaks High, you're a guy of major import. But Beth Sullivan, cheerleader, Miss Teen USA semi-finalist, and most popular girl in school. Beth Sullivan definitely does not know you exist. - Thanks a lot, Irwin. - Don't mention it. I'm always here for ya. - Hey, Josh. How's it goin'? - It would go a lot better if I could breathe. - Well, what's the status of my homework, pal? - Um. - You didn't forget about my homework. Did you, pal? 'Cause my homework is very, very important to me. - Well, actually, Duke, I've been thinking about your homework a lot lately. - You hear that? He's been thinking. Now that's what I like to hear. I love this guy. Mwah. - And after much thought, I came to the conclusion that it's pointless for me to do your homework, 'cause the whole point of doing your homework is so you can learn. And how can you learn if I'm doin' all your homework for ya? - Oh, I'll learn, Kirby. I'll learn how to kick your butt. You do my homework. - Duke, what are you doing? Why are you picking on this guy? He's weird. - Ah, babe. You got me all wrong. Ah, my pal Josh and me are just workin' out some business. Ain't that right, pal? Sure, that's right. Just go along with the guys, honey. I'll see you in the gym. The homework, Kirby. - Don't worry, man. I got your back. (bell ringing) (light playful music) (dog whining) - Genghis? Hey, Genghis. What's wrong, Genghis? Huh? (electric buzzing) Holy moly! (zapping) (electronic beeping) - X marks the spot. (footsteps thumping) (electronic beeping) (knocking) - Nobody's home. (electronic beeping) (knocking) All right, all right, I'm coming. Don't have a fit. Ah! Woah, Josh man. You almost gave me a heart attack. What the heck are you wearing? - It's my dad's spare industrial gear from the plant. I'm a little worried about contamination. - From me? - No. From this. - Cool! I give up. There's nothing in any of this stuff that remotely resembles that crazy thing-a-ma-jig you found. - You know, it must be pretty cool to have a dad who's a physicist. - My dad's a wuss. But it does come in handy when it comes to science projects. Maybe your dog dug it up. Maybe it's some kind of bizarre bone that got buried in China and some how worked its way through the earth's core until it wound up in your backyard. - Get real. I told you a million times, it was crackling like lightning when I found it. It must have some hidden power source inside somewhere. - [Irwin] Hey, maybe it's some kind of new battery. - And maybe it's some new kind of nuclear warhead. (phone ringing) (gasping) (phone ringing) - Phone. Lee residence. Irwin Esquire speaking. - [Josh's Dad] Irwin, is Josh over there? - He's coming down now. - Who is it? - [Irwin] Guess. - Dad? - Josh, get your but home right now. - [Josh] But Dad, I found the most incredible thing in Genghis Khan's doghouse. - I've told you a thousand times, you come straight home from school, finish your homework, and then we'll talk about your social life. - But Dad. - 15 minutes or your bike privileges are history. - I'm dead. (footsteps thumping) (doorbell ringing) (electronic beeping) (laughing) - How long did it take you jokers to build this thing down at the plant? Hey Herb, is that you in there? (laughing) Uh, uh, uh, uh. (dramatic music) - Nothing. (dog barking) - [Josh] I told you a million times, it was crackling like lightning when I found it. It must have some hidden power source inside somewhere. - For a 20th century primitive, you have been most helpful. (dog barking) (pulsing lightning) - Ahh! Woah! - [Irwin 1138] The Nullifier component, young man. I must have it. - Pardon me? - [Irwin 1138] Don't toy with me, boy. I know it's here in this time, in this place. I sent it here. - [Dr. Zoetrope] Don't listen to him, Joshua. This evil genius wants to destroy the earth. Turn the Nullifier component over to me and I'll see that it's put to its proper use. - [Irwin 1138] Don't listen to him, boy. - Wha, what? How did you know my name? - Your friend Genghis Khan told me. - Oh, oh, my dog. My dog told you my name? Okay. Look, I'm sure this is some kind of dream or hallucination brought on by too much dye and too little sleep, but just in case it's not, I have got to get home before my dad gets really PO'd. Well, it was really nice meeting you people from other worlds. Goodbye. (lasers blasting) Hey, take it easy, pal. - [Irwin 1138] He's nobody's pal, young man. (lasers blasting) - My bike! (lasers blasting) (creature jabbering) Hey, who are you? (creature jabbering) Hey! Holy moly! - [Irwin 1138] Quick! Prism! Quick, before he gets away. - [Josh] Oh no you don't. - [Irwin 1138] Brace yourself, Prism. Prepare for the storm. - [Josh] Oh. Ah! - Oh, no. (dog barking) - Woah! Ah! - Calm down, young man. You shouldn't be here. - Oh, you're telling me. Well, what's going on? And where are we? - Hyper time. The limbo which flows between every moment of past, present, and future. There, we've got him, Prism. (crashing) - Who is this guy? And why are we chasing him? - That, young man, is the insane Dr. Zoetrope 366. And we are not chasing him. I am chasing him. - So you better step on it 'cause he's getting away. (engines rumbling) - Ah! - [Josh] Woah! - All right. - Come on. - Thank you, young man. Dr. Zoetrope must not be allowed to escape the Nullifier component. And... - Nullifier? What's a Nullifier component? - The Nullifier was a strange alien device which washed up in the Milky Way galaxy. Young Zoetrope was the only man on earth clever enough to decipher its true purpose. To nullify all of existence, past, present, and future. - A Nullifier, perfect, transit. A drainer void. You mean that thing I found in my backyard could destroy the world? - No, not on its own. But when it's reassembled together with its five other component parts. The authorities confiscated the Nullifier and ordered it destroyed, but having this brilliant discovery taken away from him drove the already unstable Dr. Zoetrope over the edge and deep into the pit of madness. He was imprisoned for his own good, and for everyone else's. - Woah. - Unfortunately, the Nullifier proved to be indestructible. Luckily I had just perfected a chrono-displacement device capable of launching inanimate object into the fourth dimension. - Wait, you invented a time machine? - Isn't that just what I said? - I was able to split the Nullifier into six component parts and then randomly launch each one into a different time zone. But that blasted know-it-all criminal Zoetrope managed to escape from prison and steal the coordinates from my computer. Now that immature madman means to collect each of the Nullifier components from all across time, rebuild the Nullifier, and then press the start button, destroying everything that has ever existed or ever will exist. - But won't that destroy him, too? - I told you, he's mad. - But if the Nullifier has to be reassembled for it to work, why do you need all six parts? Why don't you just grab one and that would keep him from putting it back together, wouldn't it? (laughing) - It's too risky. Zoetrope is so darn smart he just might reassemble the Nullifier using only five pieces. Or four, or three, or two, or-- - Okay, okay, I get the idea. But how could he do all this? I thought you invented the time machine? - Turns out Zoetrope invented that lousy time armor of his before I even built my time pod. He was just so obsessed with the Nullifier, he didn't bother to tell anybody. - Well, you gotta admit, time armor is cooler than a time pod. - Do you think I don't know that? Sure, time armor's cool. It's not very practical, is it? You can only get one person into time armor. Look how many people you can get into my time pod. - Yeah, I guess. (whooshing) - Time bomb! Hit the deck! (bomb exploding) (electricity crackling) Blast. We've lost him. Prism, concentrate. Try and get a fix on the Nullifier component. - [Josh] What's he doing? - Well, Prism is something you 20th century types call a bloodhound. For some reason I have yet to determine, seems that Prism has a vital link with the Nullifier component. Whenever he gets close to a piece of the alien device, he begins to glow with colors. Now... Without Prism here I'd be totally unable to pick up Zoetrope's trail. - All right, come on. - [Irwin 1138] What are you doing? - I'm just making sure this isn't a dream. Look, mister. I've got to get out of here. - Young man, I didn't ask you to intrude, so you better make the best of it. - I didn't ask you to bring me along, either. I demand you take me home. - Take me home. (laughs) Such petty concerns. I've got to catch Zoetrope before it's too late. - I don't believe this. Look, I appreciate the need to save the world and all, but I think I'm in a little over my head. Look, I'm not gonna be any help to you. I'm only 14. So just drive me back home and I'll be out of your hair. - Will you stop harping? I can't go anywhere until I get my time pod fixed. And we're not going back anywhere. After Zoetrope's mad hopping through the time stream, your era will cease to exist. - What are you talking about, my era won't exist anymore? You're crazy. - Perhaps you'll believe me if you see it. - [Josh] What's going on? This isn't my home. - [Irwin 1138] I'm afraid you're wrong, young man. That is your home. - No, no, I don't believe you. - You won't believe anything, will you? Hmm, read that. - September 14, 1994. 7:32:59am. September 14th, 7:32am. I'm supposed to be getting up for school right now. Duke Dunkington's supposed to beat me up today when I don't give him his homework. - I'm sorry to tell you this, young man. But the chaos caused by Zoetrope's mad rampage through the time stream has altered history in a somewhat catastrophic manner. - Green Oaks, my house, my dad. Oh, Beth Sullivan. I never got the chance to show her I wasn't weird. All right, Josh, come on. Wake up. You can do it. Just, just wake up. Where's that stupid alarm clock? - Get ahold of yourself. Our only chance now is to track down Zoetrope 366 and put an end to his deadly romp through the time stream before he retrieves all the Nullifier components and puts an end to the universe. - How will that help? My universe is already destroyed. How are we gonna get my world back to the way it was? The way it's supposed to be? - I don't know. But I assure you, it's all very real, Joshua. That is what Zoetrope called you. - Yeah. Yeah, Josh Kirby. - Look, Joshua. Let's not get off on the wrong foot. I am Irwin 1138, one of the most brilliant men of the 21st century. - One of the most. - Well, second actually. - Hmm, second. Who's the first? - You've already met him. Ha, I'm afraid I have to admit that young Zoetrope 366's brainpower exceeds my own by 8.6 cerebral grams. - Ah, just my luck. I had to hook up with the second-most brilliant man of the 21st century. - No need to get personal, young man. - I'm sorry. I guess I was just upset about, you know. Here, look, maybe if we drag Zoetrope back the way he came, retracing steps through time, everything will go back the way it was before he showed up. - It's impossible. The time-displacement postulate clearly states that temporal events, once altered, can never be returned to their original state. - Well who came up with that? - [Irwin 1138] Well, I did, of course. - Have you ever tested that postulate outside a laboratory? - Um, it's never been tested at all. - Well, you've gotta admit, there's still a chance. Look, besides, you've gotta find a way to put things back. If the late 20th century is this messed up, the 25th century must be really screwed. - Your primitive 20th century reasoning is inescapable. Perhaps there is a chance after all. I hope you're prepared to do battle, young man. This will be a war through time, and Dr. Zoetrope will take no prisoners. - All right, it's now or never. Let's go. (dramatic music) - 1205 AD. Prepare for the storm. (engines rumbling) (engines blasting) (upbeat instrumental music) (doors whirring) - [Josh] So you're telling me we're in medieval England? Yeah, right. Woah. - Your sacrifice will not be forgotten, good friend blacksmith. Someday when William of Dearborn can be restored to his rightful throne, all this may be over. (Prism jabbering) - How do you do that, Prism? - Oh, it's some kind of complex transference of matter particles from one spacial zone to another. - So in other words, you have no idea. - Do you know, when I was your age, what's that noise? (whirring) Ah. Oh. - Hey, are you okay? - [Irwin 1138] Yes, oh. - On your knees, slaver. - Slaver? We're not slavers. - You spare me your lies, boy. Send me back to my comrades at the front immediately. - Look, I would if I could, but I can't. - Don't you realize I could sever your puny head from your narrow shoulders in a millisecond? - Now that wouldn't do either of us any good because I'd be dead and you'd be stuck here in 1205 AD. - What year did you say it was? (Prism jabbering) Ah! Slaver beast, get away from me. - Hold it right there. Now listen to me. First of all, you have no reason to be mad at us because we didn't bring you here. Second of all, you're only a few years older than me, so don't call me boy. My name is Josh Kirby. - And I am Azabeth Siege. - Take care of my horse. See that my son Jamie grows up strong. He likes a wormy apple now and then. My horse, I mean. (growling) (leaves rustling) - Uh, Irwin? - Busy, Josh. - No, Irwin. - Look, Josh, I... (screaming) - [Azabeth] Take your hands off me, you imbeciles. - Josh, do you think they mean us harm? - I'd say that's pretty much an affirmative, Irwin 1138. All right, would somebody please tell us what's going on? - You have that right. We were to sacrifice one of our own, drawn by lot. A meal to give the baron's hungry dragon. - Dragon? Irwin, did he say dragon? - Don't worry, Josh, Azabeth. It's all just some kind of primitive myth. There never were any such things as dragons. This must be just some kind of medieval jest played on strangers. (laughing) (deep rumbling) - [Man] It's coming! Let's go! [Woman] Hurry! - [Man] This way! Wait! (growling) - Sorry about this lads and lady. Thanks all the same. - [Man] Come with me. Hurry! Quickly! (roaring) - No such things as dragons, you said. Then what's that? - That's no dragon, Josh. I can understand how these simple peasants might think so. It's, it's a dinosaur. (roaring) It must've been accidentally transported here in the wake of Dr. Zoetrope's escape through the time stream. - You know, I think it thinks we're lunch. (roaring) (soft instrumental music) - Sire, the sacrificial party has returned, but the blacksmith has been spared. Captured strangers are said to be at this very moment being sacrificed in his stead. - Strangers? What strangers? (groaning) - God, this isn't good, Irwin 1138. - I'm inclined to agree with you, Joshua. - If only I had my weapons. (roaring) - We must rescue them, mustn't we? (roaring) - Hey, who are you guys? - I might ask you the same question. (roaring) (chomping) - Bring me your weapon. (chomping) (roaring) (dramatic music) - Who are you? - I'm Jolly Jack. Who are you? (chomping) (roaring) (groaning) - Hide them in the blacksmith's hut. - But Azabeth! - No, we must run now, boy, or we are lost, too. - My stick, thank you. Keep going! (roaring) - Take her. - [Man] Good morning, Charles. - [Man] Morning to you. (laughing) - Jamie! Ha, welcome gents. I'm the blacksmith here in our little piece of heaven. And this is my son, Jamie. Say hello, Jamie. - Hello. - Hi, I'm Josh. And this is Irwin 1138. - Hello, Jamie. - I feel terrible about what almost happened to you today. Really I do. I offer you safe haven in my little shop and if there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, all right? - What's that? - This? This is-- - Good sirs, William of Dearborn requests your presence in his hut. He begs you come now if you please. - William, that's the one who rescued us? - Great. We've got to organize another rescue, pronto. One of our group's been captured by the evil guy on the dinosaur, or the ah, the dragon. - The baron will decide if there's to be any kind of... - Rescue? Out of the question. - But why? - You've stumbled into a situation you know nothing about, boy. Why don't you both go back where you came from? Wherever that is. - All right, it's true. We're strangers, but our friend needs our help. - We all need help. Whether we could all find it. - Hmm. - You're puzzled, strangers. - Well, a little clarification would be welcome, yes. - I am Theodore and you've met our friend the blacksmith. - Mmm, my name is Irwin 1138. This is Josh Kirby. - Our leader, William of Dearborn, was until recent times the baron of this region. - And a better lord and leader no man ever had. - But William's younger brother, the evil Lord Henry, treacherously betrayed him, took over his lands, and set himself up as baron. - And a more miserable jackal of a man you'll never find. - Why didn't William fight back? - He did. - We all did at first, but the Lord Henry bought the cruel might of a mercenary army to protect him. And then the dragon came. And to feed its hunger, the Lord Henry demanded a sacrifice to the great beast each new moon. - Each new moon? - That's once a month. - I knew that. - The dragon was the final straw. It's terrible presence sapped William's spirit to fight. If we don't feed the beast each new moon, Henry has threatened to let it destroy the village and devour us all. William dares not let that happen. So we do nothing. Yeah, but you saved us. William couldn't bear the thought of responsibility for your deaths too. But now he worries that there will come renewed reprisals against the village from he dragon Lord Henry. (roaring) (laughing) - [Woman] You children come back here now. (children laughing) - Look at this. - [Man] Come together. (people conversing in background) - [Henry] Damn my brother's eyes, the gall to interfere with the sacrifice. The royal dragon has not been fed in weeks. His humor is most foul. - Oh, baron. Can thou tellest me what is black and white, is black and white, is black and white, and black and white? - A similarly garbed clergyman rolling down the hill. - Oh, jester. - [Jester] Sire. - Have you eaten yet? - [Jester] Yes. Thank you, sire. (fingers snapping) - [Henry] Good. Then prepare to be eaten. Feed him to my dragon. - Wait, wait. Wouldst thou like to hear a dirty jest? - You will pay for taking me prisoner, you mongrel dog. (grunting) - Will I? (grunting) (dramatic music) - Unusual jewelry. What if I take it? - Then you would be a thief as well as a coward. (laughing) - Have her bathed and scented. Dressed in finery from Lady Jennifer's wardrobe and brought to my chambers for supper this evening. - Yes, Baron. - Welcome back, my Lord. - Ah, the lady of the house. - Well, I hope that is what I am to you, my Lord. - Yes, yes, I plucked you from the muck of the village to be my consort. When was it, Lady? - 'Twas a year ago, my Lord. Surely you haven't forgotten. - A year, you say? I swear it feels like 10. - Will you take supper tonight, my Lord? - I dine alone tonight, Lady. Eat with your maids if you must have company. Send for the grand wizard. (people talking in background) - Announcing the grand wizard. (dramatic music) - Greetings, royal alchemist. (dramatic music) - Greetings, sire. For your collection. - Splendid. What else have you been up to this day? - Still endeavoring to change lead into gold for you, sir, though it may take awhile. - Succeed and you shall see how truly grateful I can be, grand wizard. But I did not send for you to speak of this, but of another matter. A matter of some newcomers. - Newcomers, Lord? - Yes, three of them. I have one imprisoned in the dungeon right now. A girl. Most beautiful. Almost unearthly. The other two, a boy and an old man, with my dear brother William down in the village. They remind me of you somehow, wizard. - Me, Lord? - Yes. Perhaps they are kinsman of yours? - No, Lord. I told you I was born right here. - Yes, so you said when first you came to us to help us tame the dragon with your device. - I hope that I can continue to be of service to you, Lord Henry. - So do I, grand wizard. So do I. - Well, well, well. Azabeth Siege, all chained up and no place to go. - Zoetrope, you vile serpent. - Tell me, when did you arrive in this time? - I'll tell you nothing. (laughing) - Have Irwin 1138 and Josh Kirby been able to locate the Nullifier component? Answer me. - Come a little closer and you'll feel my answer. - Ah, ah. Foolish, foolish girl. - How did you turn Prism against us? (laughing) - That was a simple matter of a mind plug. I could implant one in you. But I think I'll wait. - We both know if you have Prism, you have a foolproof way to locate the Nullifier component. So why ask me? - Well, unfortunately one of the side effects of the mind plug is little Prism's mane of many colors no longer functions. But I will find the Nullifier component, fear not. Enjoy your stay in the dungeon, Azabeth Siege. I have a feeling it's going to be a very long one. (Prism jabbering) - You little devil. (glass breaking) Stop that! (Prism jabbering) I know with the mind plug in you, you can't remember your friends, little one. But they are here now and I must find the Nullifier before they do. The locator in my helmet was damaged in the ride into this time. Too bad. I wonder. It was putting the mind plug in that took away your mane of many colors. Perhaps if I take the mind plug out it will bring it back. (Prism jabbering) Ha. - [Prism] Ah. Ow! Ah! (Prism jabbering) - Ah, wonderful. You have given me an idea. - Come on then. Come on, boy. Come on. Get it. (horse neighing) - What's that, then? - Uh, well that, that there is a, that's a food storage compartment is what that is. Yeah, you put your food in there, and then it doesn't get spoiled or anything. - You're an inventor? - Yes. Oh, yeah. You could say that, yes. - I'm an inventor, too. (spitting) See that pale with the holes punched in it? Gives Beatrice a nice cool shower in the heat of the day. I invented that. Keeps food from spoiling. Why don't you just eat the food before it spoils? How does it work? - Well, right now it doesn't. And we would like your help to mend it, master blacksmith. - Oh, it's the least I can do. Bring it here, gents. - Right, I'll untie it. You bring it here. (dramatic music) (roaring) (Prism jabbering) - We will find the Nullifier if we have to walk the entire baroning, my little friend. (Prism jabbering) - Wizards. - [Irwin 1138] Try the left. (pod creaking) Darn it. Oh. No good. I'll have to disassemble the coaxial interocator. - You know, I think the blacksmith's starting to wonder about us. - As long as he doesn't start tinkering around on his own. - Well, he's keeping pretty busy with that slingshot. - Mmm. - It's a birthday surprise for Jamie, so don't tell him. I only wonder if we should tell. - What? The truth? Not unless he asks us. Look, he's our friend and he trusts us. That's enough for now. (grunting) - In you go, girly. Get in the little bath, top neither. - Why have you brought me here? - The baron wants you bathed and dressed to supper with him tonight, that's why. Though for the life of me, I can't see what you've got to offer that the Lady Jennifer ain't. - Who is this Lady Jennifer? - The baron's lady, that's who. Well, she's gonna like you being here, I can tell you that. Still, ours is not to reason why. Now, off with your knickers. - My what? - Your knickers, your tops and bottoms, love. - I will not be stripped of my uniform. - Oh, yes, you will, me fine girl. You'll either do it yourself or I'll do it for ya. - All right, I shall undress myself, you slime serpent from the poison rivers of Amdor. - Oh, no use insulting me, deary. Just rolls off me like water off a duck's ass, it does. Now you get them queer-lookin' things off and I'll be back with somethin' pretty for you to put on later. - What's wrong, Josh? - Our friend Azabeth was captured by your dragon Lord Henry. We've gotta find a way to rescue her. But William and everyone else say it's impossible. That there's no defense against Henry's T-Rex, or dragon, that is. - I know where there's another dragon. - Azabeth doesn't know, but I care a lot about her. We can't just do nothing. What did you just say? - I know where there's another dragon. Suppose to be, anyway. - Another dragon? Are you serious? Oh, oh, I've gotta find William. (suspenseful music) - How's the water, little lady? Fine, I hope. All right then, put these on when you're through with your bath. - Then what? - Then you sit here and wait until the baron calls for ya, that's what. (suspenseful music) - Put that down. - [Azabeth] Who are you? - Never mind who I am. That is my dress and I said put it down. - [Azabeth] You're the Lady Jennifer, aren't you? - How dare you even speak my name, you common trash. (grunting) Get off me! Get off me this instant! - Stop! Stop or I will have to apply a sleep lock and I warn you, waking from a sleep lock is not pleasant. - The baron is mine. He is mine. Do you understand? - You think I wish to take the baron for myself? - Ah, don't try to deny it. I know you do. - [Azabeth] But I swear I do not. - Ha, liar. - Even if I wanted to, the codes of Kang are quite specific about the danger, the 17th in particular. Whosoever takes another woman's man does keep close watch on her own. - Codes, Kang, I know nothing of these. You're just trying to confuse me. - If I let you up, will you quit? - Yes. - Jennifer, listen to me. - Lady Jennifer. - Lady Jennifer, all I want, all I want is to escape this castle and return to my friends. - Well, I can tell you that's not all the baron wants. - I care not what that man wants. - Ah, you say that now, but wait. He fancies you. Yes, he will try to woo you. And he can be quite persuasive. - What is this wooing? - What is to woo? To win thy desired one's heart. To make the tender advance. - I am my own woman and I cannot be wooed as you say unless I wish to be, and I do not wish to be. - Ah, yes. I was much as you in the beginning. But Henry is, he's quite forceful. And I saw quickly it was better to give in than to fight. - It's a shame you've had to give into any man. - Oh. - Jennifer, wait. (door closing) (sighing) - Don't you see? It's a chance, at least. I mean, if another dragon does exist, it might be possible to use it to win back your crown and rescue my friend. - I, too, have heard reports of this other dragon, Josh Kirby, but no one has yet seen it. I repeat, no one. - So what? I mean, maybe it's shy or something. But if it does exist, wouldn't you want to know about it? All right, do you want your castle and stuff back or not? - Take care, boy. You tread heavily. - Hey, whatever it takes. Our friend is in trouble, and if you won't go, I'll go myself. - All right. Theodore, organize a search party with Jolly Jack. A hunting we will go, it seems, for a dragon. - All right, excellent. - Which shall it be, dresser? The black or the red? - Black. Black does suit you, Baron. - It is true. Black is my color. Yet I feel the red will make a certain emotion of mine clear to the maid we captured this morning. - Yes, I see your point. The red then, and good luck, sire. - I don't need luck, dolt. I have charm, looks, money, land, a castle, and a dragon. - Yes, sire. - Good day, your ladyship. - Who says it is? (knocking) - Come. - It is only me, my Lord. - Oh, rapture. Leave us. What can I do for you now, madam. - Oh, and why do you speak to me so formal, my Lord. - Formally, Lady. - I beg pardon? - Formally. When will you learn to speak the king's English? - I've taken lessons as you wish, my Lord. - I should think that tutors would have greater success with my dragon. - When will this cease? - When will what cease? - These, these insults. These barbs. They cut so deeply. These cruelty marks that I have not earned and do not deserve. - 'Tis the way I always speak to you, Lady. I know not what you mean. - 'Tis that barbarian wench, isn't it? - Which barbarian wench? - Don't play innocent with me, Henry of Dearborn. You're having her dressed right now and in my own gown, no less. Oh, Henry. Aren't I good enough for you? I once was, you know. - Don't press me on that point, Lady. You may get an answer you don't wish to hear. - I will not tolerate this. I will not. - No? I think you will. I remind you, Lady Jennifer, that you are here by my good graces and my good graces alone. If you don't want to be back in the village churning butter with the other peasant maidens, you will kindly cease your complaining of treatment by me and occupy yourself in some productive fashion. Do I make myself clear? - Yes, Baron. Quite clear. (suspenseful music) - Does anyone know where we are? We could get lost this way. - Fear not, Theodore. We won't get lost. - I might ask, if we come upon the great beast, what is our plan? - The Nullifier component. - Yes, Josh Kirby, what is our plan? - Plan? I, uh, I don't really have a plan. (growling) (roaring) - Will it charge? - I'm not sure. Theodore, do you still have that apple? Thanks. (chewing) All right, all right, everybody look around. Fruits, just anything we can find. All right, go. (footsteps thumping) - He's following you, Josh. - Yeah, must be hungry. That's a break for us. - How do we know it won't eat one of us next? - Because it only eats fruits and vegetables. That's the kind of dinosaur, er, dragon, this is. - How do you know so much about these creatures, Josh Kirby? - I study them in school. - Really? I must hear more about this progressive land you come from. - Yeah, sure, anytime, - You were right. There was another dragon. I owe you an apology. - Nah, skip it. Now maybe now you'll consider my other idea. - That we should launch an assault against the castle and my brother with the aid of this creature? - We could take him, I know we could. - I'm not so sure. (chewing) - Right, Theodore, will you lend me your saddle? - You're not gonna saddle this beast? - Saddle and ride, your highness. (dramatic music) (roaring) - These are for you from Lord Henry himself, no less. Ah, well, aren't you a picture? (chuckles) Who'd a guessed? - What am I doing? This is what I think of your flowers, Lord Henry. - The wench has fire in her. I like it. - How are the repairs on the time pod coming? - Well, overall quite well considering the primitive time period we're in. We should be fully operational by tomorrow morning, I hope. - Well, I found something other than a dinosaur. - What? - An impression in the ground that looked exactly like a Nullifier component. - But not the Nullifier itself. Did you see it? - No. - Oh, well at least we know it's around here somewhere. - Yeah, well I'm really worried about Azabeth. - Oh, I share your concern, Joshua. - Well, now William has another dinosaur. He's agreed to take a rescue vote at the council meeting tonight. - If we could infiltrate the castle. - We could rescue Azabeth, get Prism back, and locate the Nullifier component all at the same time. - That's my thought exactly. - Put her there. - Thank you, Joshua. - Order, order gentlemen, please. - I have asked you all here tonight to determine what you, my subjects loyal, would have me do about the tyranny we have all been living under this past winter. - [Woman] Oh, yes. - We are joined tonight by the two strangers in our midst without whom I dare say we would not be having this council meeting. Thanks to Josh Kirby, we now have a dragon of our own to defend against the predations of my brother. But is to defend all that we wish to do? - No. - For some time I have despaired of doing anything about the terrible conditions under which we have been forced to live, but now I feel new hope that we can overcome adversity and have life once again as it was before. And so I ask you, my loyal friends, are you with me in a push against the castle and Henry of Dearborn? If so, let me hear it from you. (villagers talking amongst themselves) - Lord, I'm just a poor blacksmith, but I say what is life under the yoke of oppression. No life at all, if you want to know the truth of it. I say we take back what was yours and ours. I say we fight! - Let's show William of Dearborn how we feel, men. Who will fight tomorrow? Call it out. - I will! - I will! - Yeah! (villagers shouting) (triumphant instrumental music) - Ah. (knocking) Enter. - I bring the prisoner, Lord. - Not the prisoner, dresser. The Lady Azabeth. - The Lady Azabeth. - Thank you, dresser. You can go now. I shan't be needing you anymore this evening. - [Dresser] Very good. - The gown suits you, Lady Azabeth. - Keep your titles, Baron. My name is Azabeth Siege, and garments such as this are only meant for the pleasure of the male. As yet another form of his sexual oppression against the female gender. - What is this sexual oppression? I've not heard of it. - For one so ignorant, you practice it well enough. - What? - Nothing. May I eat now? - Of course. You're hungry. The bill of fare in my dungeon leaves much to be desired. So they tell me. Try the wine. From the finest cellar in all the region. (laughing) - Your brother's cellar, so they say. - Do they? Well, they're wrong. My wine, my cellar, and now my vinery. And a Baron, you know, needs its baroness. - Then it is good you have Lady Jennifer. - Yes. Let's be frank with one another, shall we? I find you very beautiful, Azabeth. - Thank you for the meal. Goodnight. - [Henry] Where do you think you're going? - Back to my room, I... Back to the dungeon. - A distinct possibility, unless you begin to show some gratitude. - I already thanked you for the meal. What more could you possibly want? - Don't toy with me, wench. You know what I want. - Why, Baron, whatever could you mean? Is that gratitude enough for you? - Guards! Guards! Guards! The courtyard, you idiots. (dramatic music) (screaming) (kick smacking) (swords clanking) (screaming) - Return her to the dungeon. Wake the royal executioner. She dies on the chopping block in the morning. (metal clanging) - What's all the commotion? - Young Josh Kirby has found another dragon after all, Father. Come and see. - [Blacksmith] Charlie, I like this. (roaring) (dramatic music) - [Narrator] On the next chapter of Josh Kirby, Time Warrior. - I bring a message from Azabeth Siege. - [Josh] Where is she? - She's being held in Lord Henry's dungeon. Henry has ordered her execution at dawn. - [Henry] Let the execution begin. - Just tell her we'll be there, and tell her not to worry. - Let's not keep the lady waiting, gent. - Attack! (screaming) (swords clanging) (roaring) - Josh Kirby. - Is the baron's alchemist a tall, dark, brooding man with a little creature that follows him wherever he goes? - Yes, the royal alchemist Zoetrope is such a man. - [Dr. Zoetrope] The Nullifier component must be in here. You're no match for me, Josh Kirby. Put that weapon down. - Ah! - [Irwin 1138] Next stop, 70379 AD. (screaming) - Well, what was that thing? I thought we were still on earth. - We are still on earth, Josh, but the earth of the far future. - [All] Woah! - Irwin, look! - Incredible. The child has a collection of time-displaced humans. - He's forcing us to fight for his amusement. - En garde! (swords clanging) - Come on, you big bully. Catch me if you can. - Listen to me, boy. There are forces at work here which you cannot understand. - No, I'll never help you. - Then you've sealed your own doom, Josh Kirby. (electric static) (train horn blowing) - In other words, we're up a creek without a paddle. (upbeat instrumental music) (MultiCom Jingle)
