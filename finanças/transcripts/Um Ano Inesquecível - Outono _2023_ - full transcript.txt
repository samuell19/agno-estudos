São Paulo, almost 13 million inhabitants. This part of my story began here. In autumn. Sampa in autumn means rush, reality, scurrying, umbrella, coat and sunscreen, altogether. The weather changes. Life's hectic and you've gotta be ready. Look at Paulista Avenue. Imagine how many dreams you can find there. For example, this was my last day of work at a law office. It seemed fancy to say this was a job, but it was a college extracurricular activity. I dreamt about being an intern there, but there's a crowd vying for the same spot. A huge, crazy competition. Was I sad? A little, but not discouraged. That's me, Anna Júlia. I like justice, working, joy. Not music. I don't like music. I didn't want this for my life. On the other hand, I wanted this! I want to be exactly like them when I'm older. It's a lot of power. This is João Paulo, - a street musician. - Hey, dude! Jeez, he turned my world upside down... Come on, guys. Let's help! Put some money in here! Let's enjoy some music, get to know art. The Pedros! Oh, no. Here comes another fantasy. Double coffee to wake up Focus and faith I will succeed It's not long before I graduate So many things, but we're here And it's written That the expert will arrive It's true, it worked out The Black woman will be in charge I came to sing My journey With magic Of being who I am - I have love in my chest - I have love in my chest - And I do it my way - And I do it my way - Axé in living - Axé in living - So I can dawn - So I can dawn Come on, guys! Good morning. Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Open my heart You know you can't be careless That this big world comes And shakes who sleeps No one can beat me It requires a lot of talent And direction and luck - I have love in my chest - I have love in my chest - And I do it my way - And I do it my way - Axé in living - Axé in living - So I can dawn - So I can dawn Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Open my heart Wait. I don't like music. An Unforgettable Year AUTUMN BASED ON THE WORK OF BABI DEWET MOM - DON'T ANSWER There's this situation too. I'll explain it soon. Sorry I'm late, Mr. Rui. Thank you. Excuse me. Hey, sorry. - Joice? - Good morning. Hi! Whose stuff is this? Heitor? Hey... Can you move your suitcase, so I can sit? Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere to put it. Go find a chair. Hey, artist! Can you stop the noise? I'm trying to watch the game. Hey, kid. Here. Thanks, Mr. Marcílio. Listen... I heard the last band here had concerts and recorded albums. The Vultures of the Next Day! They played at Covers Square and made a music video that went viral. Hi. Came to perform? In order to play here, you need to get a pass at the end of the line - with Baby, who is beside Junk. - The wonderful Junk! If you want, come back at dawn. There's no line nor audience. But you can play. I won't even say a word. - Come on! Guys, stay! - I'm leaving, JP. Where are you going? Go get coffee and come back. I'll wait in line. I'll stay here... CULTURAL TURN FESTIVAL ONLY ORIGINAL SONGS This will be a trend. Hi, Dad. Did something happen? Yes. I miss you a lot, kiddo! And I'd like to know if you want a ride. I'm driving a nice client near your office. - We could celebrate, right? - There's nothing to celebrate. But you should, Anna Júlia! Girl, now you'll have more free time. Dindinha, tell her. - Hey, girl! How are you? - Hi! Your father told me everything. Enjoy those young years, girl! Only you would make me talk to a passenger. - Are you driving? It's dangerous. - No, baby. We're stuck in a traffic jam. I just called to see if everything is okay. It will be, Dad. Since you work nearby, come by my house later. - It's in More Than One Squat. - Thanks. I'll be there. - Bye, beautiful girl. - Bye, honey! - Take care of him. - Love you. Bye, guys! MESSING AROUND IN THE OFFICE Go mess around at home, bye. Attention, everyone. I've got news for you. Well... We lost an intern. So, I decided to expand the internship program to hire one of you to replace him. This means that this is not the last day for any of you. And for those who want to start a career at this firm, the good news is... you have more time to impress me. - Joice? - Yes? - Grab me a cappuccino, please. - Sure. No, allow me! You changed the Wi-Fi password? What? Mr. Zé Carlos, I'm a customer today. It's a cappuccino. Fancy stuff. Tell me the password. WI-FI PASSWORD BUY A CAKE Empathy! I like you. Excuse me. Is this the line? Oh, my God! He's so hot. Why did I need just one cappuccino? Is this a cappuccino? - Yes, it is. - Would you sell it to me? I'll give you the money, and you give me the goods. Nice to meet you. My name is João Paulo. You are? Thanks. We did business, and you didn't tell me your name. Hey, don't forget it, okay? João Paulo! In honor of the two Beatles. - Are you in line? - No. DESTINY MAKES YOUR PATH RHYME WITH MINE IT'S LIKE EMICIDA'S VERSE, WHEN YOU SEE IT, IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. You're fast. So, pick me. This internship is all I ever wanted. - I know. - I won't let you down. You must work hard, Anna. Things here are not easy. You saw the competition. You must pay attention to everything. Especially to the details. Be careful! If you break it, you need to give me another one. The stairs! Watch your step. Hey! Stop it! Excuse me. It won't pass. - For God's sake. - Stop complaining. Excuse me, man! - Watch the stairs! - What's going on? What's this? Watch the door. Are we moving and no one told me? The band is over, right? We're moving back to Jaú. The band is over? What do you mean, Pedro Jorge? Excuse me. - Who decided that? - I did, right? We talked about the festival. It's our chance. The festival only accepts original songs. We have none. But we are good! We are good, but have we written anything yet? - No. - Right. - How will we win the festival? - Relax. Calm down, brothers. Isn't that what we are? Brothers! The Pedros Plus One. I'm not Pedro! But you are my brothers, man. Stay! There's cheese in the fridge. Is it the mess? - No. - I know. This has nothing to do with this mess or with you. - We are the problem. - Guys. My mom is in a hurry. Bye, JP! See you! The dream is over. Go ahead! I'll stay here. I'll stay and write a song. You'll see! I'm gonna prove to you that one João Paulo is much more powerful than three Pedros together! One! "THE PEDROS PLUS ONE" THE BEST COVER BAND IN JAÚ That day felt like my dream was starting to become a reality. As if it was the first day of the rest of my life. An orderly, organized life, with everything in place. The dream of a Black girl who loves justice and was born to be a lawyer. All set. Time to sleep, to eat, to wake up, no music, no mess, no despair, no nostalgia, just will. The will to speed up even more and finally be able to say, "Nice to meet you. I'm Anna Júlia, a lawyer." This is so me, right? Will you be a singer, daughter? I love singing with you. Will you sing one more with me? Will you? Will you? Let's do it. Beautiful! Dad, can I borrow your black jacket? Good morning to you too, honey. Come have breakfast. I don't have time. The jacket? - I gave it away. - Dad! Not that jacket! The guy was freezing to death. I couldn't let him. He was alone, abandoned. Oh, my God. - Only you would do that. I'm off to work. - Okay. Aninha, what about the coffee? At least have the milk I prepared to celebrate yesterday. Please. That's it. Listen to your father! - Okay, Dad. Look. - As if. - Yummy. - There's no napkin. No, let me do that. You're late. God... I love when you treat me like a baby! - Love you. - Cookie? I'll take it for the ride. Anna? MOM - DON'T ANSWER Answer it. Deal with it once and for all. This has already been dealt with. Anna! LAW SCHOOL I don't think you get it, Anna Júlia. I'd like to know if you'd defend someone who did something very wrong, like stealing some old man's pension. I got it, Heitor. And I've answered you, but I can slow down so you can understand. I wouldn't defend the person or what they did. I'd defend my client's constitutional rights. The constitutional rights of your client? You're talking like a lawyer, and we're just freshman. - Take it slow, Anna Júlia. - I'm in a hurry, Heitor. That's because I'm a woman ahead of my time. My professor and maybe future boss. Gotta please her, right? I tried to make it worthwhile I didn't care about problems I thought I was enough But I wasn't for you I tried to be the perfect guy I did things your way I wanted to be more important But I wasn't for you It did last, tell me why You wasted so much time here I'll do you a favor and vanish I was just another one for you I don't know if it was due neediness Or lack of choice I just know that I felt love Too bad, I was the only one who felt love Sorry. What do I do with plans For the coming years? I swear I don't know I just know I felt love Too bad, I was the only one who felt love I was the only one who felt love Thank you! - Thanks for saving me that time. - No problem. If you need anything, tell me. - Don't you wanna write a song for me? - What? Nothing. I'm kidding. What's your name? - Wesley. - Wesley! - Nice to meet you. - João Paulo. We need this case. - Know anything about these squatters? - Not yet. - I know it's nearby. - I need a connection there. Sorry, I overheard your conversation... Hello? No, I'm not busy. Go on. I love the scarf! Yes, I'm listening. MORE THAN ONE SQUAT FEARLESS PEOPLE - Hey, excuse me. - Sorry... We have these food staples that we deliver to families. There's a meeting now. We'll go to the kitchen later to see... Hey! I'm Anna Júlia, do you remember me? Guilherme's daughter. The driver. We talked on the phone. - I do remember. The working girl. - Thanks. Tell me, are you here to volunteer? Sure, who do I talk to? To me. I was one of the first in this squat. I can't talk to you right now because I have a meeting. - Will you come back later? - I will! - I'll be waiting for you. - Count on me. Look how everything can change suddenly in autumn. Oh, my... I told you, right? Oh, no! I need to go to work! - Right now? - Yeah. - And I can't be late. - But you also can't make the rain stop, can you? Oh, rain, come and tell me if I can... - No! - I know. It touches deep inside, right? There's also another rain song I love. It's by Gil. He is a god. I have many gods and goddesses too. Maria Bethânia. Elza Soares... No, that's not what I meant. I don't like music, got it? - How don't you like music? - I don't. No way. It's like you don't like chocolate, spooning or the acai berry. - Impossible. - You're not making any sense. If I sang you a song by Melodia You'd follow me like this Like Cartola and his roses Wonderful, like Jorge and Gil And Lady Gaga would migrate From her island to our Brazil Singing a song by IZA Or M.I.A. like Caetano in a drumbeat There's Sabotage and Rita Lee Chico Science and Nação Zumbi And so many people I love And I don't even sing in this song They're great artists, but I don't like music. I don't believe it. Prove it. - How? - I don't know. Sing. Music makes me cry I don't know how to sing It makes me soft, I lose my gaze Music sticks Glues in my mind I get all wrong, I have to study Music reminds me Of things I don't wanna see And it makes me sad Sad without knowing Are you gonna say that a samba doesn't make you happy? Tell me you don't get excited listening to Elis? I've got to go. It's almost time. Are you gonna say that at the end of a show you don't ask for an encore? Stop messing with my head, please! I don't like music, but I can't say the same about you. Where are you going? We've done business, almost kissed and you haven't said your name! Anna Júlia. My name is Anna Júlia. Anna Júlia? Your name is a song. Anna Júlia! Those who see you passing by me... Hey, Anna Júlia! Wow! You don't know what just happened! Excuse me, Sophia! I really want to talk to you about this case. Alexa, what should I do when an intern candidate comes to my office all soaked? Hello, tell her, "You snooze, you lose." I'm sorry. I overheard your conversation about the squat. I think I can help. I know someone inside. I want you to talk with your connection to find out how things work there, but you must be discreet. They can't know you work here. The case is not ours yet. Not officially. - Can you do this for me, Anna? - Sure. I'll deliver the report as soon as possible. - Great. That's the Anna Júlia we want. - I won't let you down, Sophia. I found you! I made this thinking about you Spooning Playlist A playlist? No, you won't convince me. DON'T LET THE NO DISTRACT YOU, SETTLE IN THE YES, LIKE TIM MAIA'S SONG - Hey! I'm here! - Relax. How are you? You good? I brought your key to the room we'll share. - Bed is made, sheets are clean... - I can't thank you enough. There's plenty of ways to thank me. Debit, credit... - Do I have to pay when I check in? - When you get there. But it's okay, right? - Yeah, it's all right. - Cool. - Have a nice day at work. - Peace. - I like the laser beam! - Thanks! Your scarf was kidnapped Ransom Lunch with me tomorrow Scarf for autumn New rug 80's musician headband Attention, JP, that's enough. Stop it. This recording is for you to stop tripping and remember your ideas. What if I write a song... about a girl wearing a colorful scarf? Who doesn't like music or rhymes. What if I write a song about a girl... I'm fixed on the girl idea. I'm obsessed with her. I wish I was Lulu. Hit after hit. The true hit maker. You're gonna be a hit maker, son! You'll look at the bunkbed and write a good song... on a bunkbed! Help me, Lulu! - Lulu? - You called me? - Lulu! - JP, right? What's up? How can I write a great song? Have you eaten? I could eat four of these. - I use a smartphone app. - Smartphones make you dumb. Right? The voice should be between the mind and the heart. In the middle. My mom, Lulu. She used to say, "I'll buy it later." These things hurt! I'd like to be more confident in front of people. You know what? Feel it. - Hold it. - But let it go. - Let it go! - But hold it! Three, four, two... And the neck is steady. Floating, smiling. Again! - JP for posterity. - Heart to the sky. Help me, Lulu! Stop tripping, right, JP? Hi. Excuse me. Good morning. Good morning, girl! You came! That's great! Coming through. Don't forget the salt. Right on time! - You'll try my food. - What an honor! But help with that pan over there. Then I'll show you around. Come on, everyone! What about our lunch? I'll meet you. I can't, João You're a musician Musicians eat too. That's why I'm here. I think the office will take the case. My boss didn't say much. They take a lot of pro bono cases, you know? - Pro bono? - When the client doesn't need to pay. Nice, right? What about you? What do you do? I sing. I know you sing, JP, but how do you make a living? That's my job. My main one. Full time! All the time, since forever. Until I die. I don't believe what you told me about the festival. I think you can pull that off. When we really want something, we go get it. We focus. Focus? I don't even know what that means. Look over there. I'll teach you. You need a chart in your head, like this plate. You split it in sections and focus on what's most important. In this case... the salad. So, that's it. I don't care much for lettuce. I don't think anybody does, but we eat it because we know it's good for our future. I think life works like a huge hot dog. - Hot dog? - Hot dog. What? You may even have a recipe. All the ingredients too, - including bacon. - Bacon? - Bacon? - Jeez! You know when you're starving and would do anything for food? It's dramatic! You take the hot dog, and the sausage jumps. It falls out. The ketchup stains your only pair of white pants. - You know? - Yeah. It's sad! And then... the hot dog... just flows. Just like life. There's no chart. There's no rule that prepare us for this ride, Anna Júlia. Got it? I have to go work. Bye. Bye. Bye! Bye! The administration office. There's paperwork, resident documentation... But I love it here. This is my vegetable garden. - Coming through! - Good morning! How are you, João? Could you plant these? Are you in charge of the administration? - I take care of everything. - Mom, Ms. Ida is feeling ill again. Jussara took her to the ER, but the kitchen is empty. I can help. Your father said you were hard-working. Come on. We have six hands to cook for 300 people. I loved lunch No problem. We can wait. Sorry! I Missed you and cried Today nothing else matters I'm going through life On this road of no return I will never give up Listening to my heart Here each one is more than one Here each one is more than one You have to smile Each one is more than one You have to cry You have to say and you have to act To work To occupy To resist To conquer our home I Missed you and cried Today nothing else matters I'm going through life On this road of no return I will never give up Listening to my heart The drum beats in my chest Here each one is more than one Here each one is more than one Here everyone has value Here there is no hurry and no color It has flavor, it has knowledge To walk To welcome And to win I Missed you and cried Today nothing else matters I'm going through life On this road of no return I will never give up Listening to my heart The drum beats in my chest Here is the report for the first day. Where is the info I requested? It's in there. - I've been there, and it's impressive. - It's personal info. I need objective info. How their structure is, what problems they're facing. Got it? - That's not it! - Right. The coffee was great. Thanks so much. - I'll sing. It'll blow your mind! - Let's do it. The guitar, the case on the ground There's no money, no Throw a dime, okay? - Can I really be honest? - Okay, mock me. - You like to mock, go on. - Keep on trying. Anna? What's all that, Dad? What? Are you redecorating our house now? No, it's Rubinho's! He had an argument with his wife and got a divorce. Suddenly, there was a moving truck outside. - What could I do? I had to help him! - Dad! Baby... I miss when you were a kid with those tiny little legs. You didn't look at me like that back then. You'd make up games. You'd knock me down, run under the table. Do you remember the moon picnic? Oh, my God! Only you would, Guiguis. Good night. Can you believe Rubinho has a DVD player? Who has one these days? Take a look. It still works. That's how I am without you I was cute, right? Cute and noisy! - Oh, my God! How could you handle this? - That's parenting. A lot of love! I still remember when your mom gave you this toy. You still have it, right? You'll be with a guy Someone who doesn't love you It will always be a thorn Inside my heart - Why are you playing this video now? - Rubinho left the DVD player here. Hey, Anna Júlia... I know... I miss watching you two together. Singing like mother and daughter. It's time for you to settle this situation with your mom. Please! You don't give up, Dad! - I'm going for a walk. - But you just got here! Dad, please, ask your friend to get rid of all this stuff because we can't live in this mess! Hey, Anna Júlia... Júlia... Júlia... The chord I played was beautiful. I liked the melody. There's a problem though. I think my lyrics are genius. Then I think they're nonsense. I'm very anxious, and I've spent a lot of time on it. Nothing good came out of it. Just one lame try, but at least I got something. - I talk too much, right? - No, not at all! I'm just dealing with a lot. But you replied so quick. I thought you'd give me a hard time. I really needed to go out today. Go anywhere, do anything. So, I am anything now? - Sorry. That's not what I meant. - Thanks! I'm just weird. Totally weird. Who doesn't like music? I just wanted to forget about today, you know? To distract myself. - Take a look. - What? I'm a great distraction. HE'S THE DISTRACTION SHE NEEDED THE MOST SHE'S THE VERSE HE COULDN'T FIND Are you sure, Babi? You know how hard it is to get an internship like this. I'm not sure if I want to work here. I admire people who are aware of their own limitations. I'm so young and still have so much ahead of me. - Anyway, you get it, right? - I really don't. - But good luck! - You too. - I'll miss you. - Take care! Babi, look on the bright side. Now that you don't work here anymore, we can go out on a date. No! Hell no! That's something I was never able to admire. Those who are not aware of their own limitations. Let's get to work! LOOKING FOR SONGWRITING PARTNER Send video Come, come, I'm going up today Come, come, today I'm... I really should know Where have you been I would like to understand Why do I feel so much pleasure When I'm with you? Of course, man! We'll write this song together. Got it? To me, the choreography is one of the most important parts for this festival performance. I was thinking about something like this, see if you like it. Like... Seven, eight and... Do you think you can follow? I guess so. I'll have to practice, right? Heitor? Your report is great. That's a good intern job. - This is just the first. - Congrats. Hear that, Anna Júlia? - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. Dear, here's your blanket. - Isabel, how is everything? - It's okay, Anna Júlia. What can we do? Last time I was here, I had some questions. How do you organize internally? Is there an election? We have lots of problems. We brought people from another building. It flooded. - The whole place flooded. - How can I help? If you can accommodate everyone, that would be nice. Jesus, the power is out. We've been facing electrical issues. If we don't get an electrician, the building could burn with us in it. Not again, man. Is the problem with the generator? What? Did something different happen? Let me guess, it was that Heitor guy. I don't know. It was just a reality check. Well, to change this reality, - how about listening to music, sing along? - Dream on, Guiguis! Honey! Wow! Our song! Sing along, baby! I know you like to play Of loving But not with me Not with me I also know that you I don't know anything else One day you will Hear from someone What I heard from you Then we will think How I dreamed in vain Don't go or go You are who you want You know what? I love you I also know that you I don't know anything else One day you will Hear from someone What I heard from you You know what? I love You know what? I love You know what? I love You Mommy! What? She's living here now. Go ahead. I'll be waiting for you right here. Dad, don't do this to me. Please. Fix this thing. Well, if not for you... At least do it for me. That's a low blow, Guilherme. You know I'll do anything for you. So, go. I'm not sure if I can do it, Dad. - Dad. - Anna Júlia... Let's get out of here. I'll leave this place if you promise me you'll talk to your mom later. Okay, I promise. Anything. Let's go. Hi, João. This is Otávio. I got your phone number on the website. Dude, I'm really excited to be in the festival. I've got a deal with a studio. Let's meet there and get to know each other. What do you say? Are you in? - Sophia, I really need to talk to you. - Say it. I've got new info about the squat. Their building has electrical issues. It could catch fire. - Burst into flames? - Yes. - I thought we could do something. - Write a report about it. That's good info. That's the kind of info we need. See you later. Welcome! - Oh, my God, man! No! - Yes! - No! - Yes. Oh, my God! Look at this, man! I feel like I'm in a spaceship! I died, right? It's impossible! It's a dream! It's like I'm in a playground just for me! Jimi Hendrix resurrected, and he's playing with me. - Jimi? - Hendrix. - Who? - Really? A guy that played the guitar. - Cool. - Can I take a look? Sure! - Man, how did you get that stuff? - It's my uncle's. So? With this production, our song will come out. - Yes! - Sure! That's why I brought you here. So you can record anything you want. Let's record some stuff. Let's get in this festival. And then, we just have to surf the social media hype. You'll enjoy it! Excuse me. Do you need anything else? No, you can go. Okay. Do you want feedback on the job you did? Yeah. You remind me so much of myself when I was your age. You wrote a very good report, Anna Júlia. I feel this position will be yours. - You must give me more reports like this. - Sure! It'll be worth it. Trust me. Tavinho. We're going to make this song, man. We just need to work on some details. A little more on the lyrics. I'll do it. Lyrics? You said lyrics? I got an idea! Wait! Stay there! I've been writing since I was a kid. I gotta show you my poetry, my rhymes. - I wrote when I was in school. - There's no need. You're doing a lot. You're working too much. Leave the song to me. We don't do anything alone here. JP, I'm with you, man. - Take the opportunity. You're so hot. - But look... I don't wanna be that hot musician type. I wanna make real music, man. I wanna sign up for the festival. - I wanna touch people's hearts. - You think you're not? I was the first to feel it. It tore me up inside, man. I'm lost. I'm completely crazy about you! Go, Hot Musician! Take a look around the studio you're in. Hit it! Hi, João. I need to celebrate. What about a real date number two? The first step of a great celebration is the power of the hot dog. Hey, guys, excuse me. Where's the bus station? - Over there! - It's over there. - Okay, thanks. Your hair is so nice! - Yours too! Thank you. Why are we running? - I don't know. Where are we going? - I know. Come! - You'll like it! - Music, JP? You'll like it! Give me a chance. Okay. Let's sing a song. One song! - You're kidding me, right? - No. I'm serious. Just one. I'll sing alone, then. Look, I'll sing alone. Do you have Várias Queixas? You can do whatever you want Even hurt me Only love overflows in my heart Since the moment I saw you I couldn't believe But if I can't, come love me Several complaints Several complaints from you Why did you do this to me? We are together and mingled Baby, I want to be your boyfriend My body shakes And wants to find your love Olodum's swing takes me With you, I'll go Take me, baby My darling Take me That way I'll go crazy for you Take me, baby My darling Take me That way I'll go crazy for you Several complaints Do you dare to love me I wonder, I wonder Do you have the courage to come I wonder, I wonder They say I'm too heavy, I'm trouble I'm mad, that I'm too much for you The real thing is that I'm aware A Black woman is different I have wounds But I also want to know How it is to be With my Black man in peace Oxalá's peace But I also want to know How it is to be With my Black man in peace Oxalá's peace Do not be afraid of me We will rock the world I see your scars You take care of me Do not be afraid of me Of my long face I just want happy days Me and you and nothing else Come stay with me Come stay with me Come stay with me I just want happy days Me and you and nothing else Come stay with me Come stay with me Come stay with me I just want happy days Me and you and nothing else Hey, where are you going? Come here. You were leaving without a kiss? - Is that it? - You looked so good sleeping. I didn't wanna wake you up, but I have to go. I don't have class today. I can get on with work. You care so much about working. You'll understand when you grow up. It's going to get cold, and I don't have my coat. I can't believe this. A girl with a life planned until the age of 170 doesn't know that in autumn in São Paulo you need a coat, a scarf, an umbrella, and a JP to protect you from the cold too. I have to go to work. Talk to you later. Thanks for the coat, okay? I'm about to start a meeting with a new client now. I need you, okay? Thank you. - Alexandre, good morning. - Good morning! - How are you? - Fine. Glad you decided to come to our office. Jaime wants to take part in the meeting. - He won't be long. - Okay, let's wait. While we wait for Dr. Jaime, I can tell you about the firm. Cases we've already won... Good morning, everyone. - Jaime. - Sorry, I'm late, - but I think we can get started. - Good morning! Alexandre, as I've told you, we're totally capable of defending your case. This is not our first case like this, and of all the cases... And of all the other cases... Anna Júlia, I think you need to take care of something outside. Sorry. Excuse me! - Hello? - Hi! Since you've got my phone, I'm calling to say good morning again. I hung up because I couldn't answer, João! - We can handle this. - I'm counting on this. Our CEO is here! Give it back! Do you want to use all of my minutes? Come on! Bye! Let's go ahead. - Baby, you're here? - Excuse me. Keep playing, go on. - You're too slow, man! - He played hard with me! Hi, Anna. Hi, João. I want to apologize. I didn't understand what happened. I'm sorry, okay? - This job means so much to me. - Internship, Anna Júlia. Almost an internship. I found it very strange you spoke to me that way. After our night together. Dad! Just relax. My noisy friends are just about to leave. I took care of that matter for you. I arranged a lunch with your mother. - You and her. - You said nothing! Anna Júlia, you promised, remember? The address and the date are here. - Sorry, João. - Why the long face? It's my mom. She left a while ago - to follow her dreams. - What kind of dreams? Music. - Now it all makes sense. - Look, João... I called you just to say I'm sorry. Now I need to be alone, okay? To think a little. - Okay. - Talk to you later. Okay. I need to write a song. You're getting in the way. Bye! Call me. - Okay. - Okay? Is it me, or are we cooking more than usual today? There are more people. Remember the flooded squat? We had to bring people here, and they're still here. But that's good, right? Less on the street, and more who can help. Soon they'll need to leave. The building can't hold everyone. And we must keep everything legal in here, - otherwise, we'll get evicted. - Got it. New report today. WITH MORE DETAILS. What if it's about a girl who doesn't like music because her mom left home to pursue her career? And, ironically, she falls in love with a musician! You're focused on that girl. - Next idea. - I'm tripping, right? A little. I gotta focus on writing my song! - That's it. - I agree. This is a good one. - Wes? - Yes? - I guess I'll give up the festival. - No! A hot musician who was born to shine will give up? - "Hot musician"? - You don't know? - What? No. - Caveman, where are you living? I don't wanna be a hot musician type. Remember the profile Otávio made for you? It has 40 thousand followers, bro. You can play whatever you want, wherever you want! And I'll get a luxury suite. Look! Come on in. - JP, what's up? - Hey, Fefito! - You're looking good! - Shall we? Wow! - Bye, bro! - Thanks. Sorry if I was weird yesterday. I miss you. Let's meet? MORE THAN ONE SQUAT GRAPHIC GROWTH PROPOSALS Sophia, here. Here's another report. - There's pressing information. - Excuse me, Sophia. Anna Júlia, there's a weird guy downstairs looking for you. If I were you, I wouldn't take long. They didn't let him in because he didn't have an ID. And he's saying that he's your boyfriend. You may go. - We'll talk later. - Excuse me. - Did something happen, JP? - No. Everything's fine now. - I was worried. - About what? Nothing. I wanted to see you. I texted you, but you didn't answer. Come here. Let me explain. This is where I work. You shouldn't have come here. It's an internship. When it's work, you won't even want to see me. - For God's sake. - That way... You know why I didn't answer? I was working. Do you know what it means? Do you understand? It's important! I understand. I understand. Excuse me, Sophia. Did you read the report? Tomorrow. Good night. MOM - DON'T ANSWER CALLING Honey. When your father called, I couldn't believe it. Yeah, he insisted that I come, so I'm here. Are you hungry? No. I'm not hungry. They serve great steak milanesa here. - I don't like steak milanesa. - You love it, Anna Júlia! Some things change over time. I'm singing at a new place. It would be great if you came to see me. Can you imagine if we sang together again? Tell me about your work. It's cool. Your father tells me you're about to get hired. I guess I am. Tell me more about your office. I write reports, Pattie. Nothing you'd be very interested in. I find everything about you interesting, Anna Júlia. I always wanna know how you are. Now? - Now you wanna know? - Anna, calm down. I'm just trying to start a conversation. Come on, Nini, I... I miss you so much. It's been two years since you've spoken to me. - You didn't miss me when you left. - I missed you! And you still don't get it, but you will one day. My choice wasn't an easy one. There wasn't a day that I didn't think of you. That's in the past! I'm here now. I'm close to you now. I... Anna! I wish I would have told her, "I really don't understand. "I don't have to understand, Pattie. I'm just a daughter who had no choice. "You left and I stayed here. In silence. "Without your voice, without your laugh, without your music." But I said nothing. WHEN LIFE ASKS YOU TO GROW, IT'S NO USE TO RUN AWAY, YOU MUST OBEY Anna! Everyone, can I have your attention? I have good news. - The meal ticket will be raised? - No. This morning I read Anna Júlia's report and decided I don't need any more time. Here's our new intern! Congratulations, Anna! You are the newest hire in our office. Thank you so much. I promise I won't let you down. - I'll be the best intern. - Congratulations, Anna. - We have a meeting. Let's go? - Let's get to work? Let's go. Sorry it took so long. - Congratulations, Anna Júlia! - Thanks! - No one goes in or out. - Hi, guys. What happened? We received a court order. Will you have to leave the building? Girl, I just know we'll resist. Let's go. Look, Isabel, I work in a real estate law office. I think they can help. Thank you, but this time the fight will be tough. The building owner hired one of the best law firms in town, Calixto and Ferreira. And they have a lot of information. Someone told them about us. Hi, honey. Your mother told me about the lunch. Anna Júlia! Dad... Please, not today. I just did something incredibly stupid. I don't want to talk about it. Okay. So, when? You never want to talk about it. She abandoned you, Dad! She said horrible things! Said you were the most unambitious guy in the world. - Why do you defend that woman? - Because that woman is your mother. Because I'm at peace with myself. And because I understood she left me to follow her dreams. - And yours too. - My dreams? Yes, yours. How do you think your course was paid for? It was your mother. She worked hard, teaching singing lessons to raise money. Got it? She just didn't want me to tell you. - How could you betray me like this? - I betrayed you, Anna Júlia? Fine. If you want to behave like the poor little girl abandoned by her mother, which obviously you're not... Pattie never stopped reaching out to you, and you know it. Wanna keep playing this game? Look at me! It's your choice. I just think it's time for you to grow up. Come on, open up to your mother! Be grateful for everything that woman has done for you! Is it really that hard? - JP! - Hi! - It's me! - Hi, kid! I have good news! - The festival accepted us. - We didn't even submit a song. You talk like you don't know me at all! I sent it to a few producers friends of mine. They did everything. For free! Great song! I don't know if your talk interests me... A little closer... - Enjoy first! - No, that's... - Didn't you like it? - It sucks! You haven't heard the second part. You used a song that's not ours to get us in? We gotta use what we have, Hot Musician. Isn't it your dream to be part of it? - Can we take a picture? - It's the Hot Musician! - He's hotter in person. - Take a picture for us? - Sure. - Yes. Want one with me too? - At least take it with my phone... - No. Yes, São Paulo. Autumn was coming to an end and look. Another part of my story. Looking at everything from up there. Now I had a badge to call my own. But neither autumn nor my badge solved the doubts I had. What's the right thing now? Smarter, more correct, fairer. What would be better in the next chapter? Do you really understand what you're saying? I understand, Sophia. That's what I'm proposing. Switch sides! Defend the squat. They don't deserve to be evicted. You know it. You want me to go against the clients that pay the office? What should I say to our associates? Do you remember debating with Heitor? Defending our client's constitutional rights. The client is Alexandre. It's his building! We work for him. I see... - Would you like the wine menu? - Please. Is there a less full-bodied wine? Like that one? That one came from our chef's menu. It's in a different wine menu. Bring it. Are you sure? I can pay for that wine. Believe me. There's nothing better for us to taste Than the ugly face when they see me paying Bring my wine, kid If you don't want trouble My skin is black to match my card Nothing comes for free You need determination to succeed in life, baby That's enough, simplify Do the right thing without cheating You know Yeah, you need to learn Yeah, you need to learn Rosé, soufflé, where is the reason This delirium is a delight An embellishment building Has nothing to do Attack those who can't fight back So there could be you and me It's really hard to understand you How can you pretend not to see Oh, baby, I'll teach you, come here Focus on the goal, make a good story Do whatever it takes You have to mature to go upstairs If something messes with your mind Think about the client You have to be efficient There's nothing indecent Don't be innocent You still live among us Every sacrifice is necessary When the current comes Better not swim backwards Six figures in my salary Black babe with millions, Bitcoins Be necessary Nothing comes for free Only those who have Determination succeed in life Do it even if it's a tantrum Show the racists the wine in the glass You need to learn You need to learn Anna, I'm hacking the system from inside. - Can I count on you? - Yes. You can, Sophia. I'll go... I'll go to the movie screens, I'll go Tell my story, I will I will - Did you like it? - Good. Very good! I love it, man! I'm thinking about submitting this song to the festival. - Is it finished? - No, it's not. - But it will be great. - Then, no. If it's not finished... We already have one. Let's stick to that one. Excuse me. If you're not playing from the heart, none of this makes sense. Sorry to bother you. This is a good jacket. It's leather! Here's an amazing hat I got you. Let's make a video. I brought a ring light. Excuse me. Go deliver the food before it gets cold. I forgot the video! Jeez! What happened here? I talked to Rubinho. It wasn't easy, but he took his stuff. He said he'll get the arcade later. I realized I was driving you crazy. It wasn't just for me, Dad. It was a bit unfair. Rubinho was taking advantage of you. Rubinho! I missed that hug! That's nice. Wait, Dad. Moon picnic? No! That's my favorite game. You first! Merci beaucoup! Dad, I'd like to apologize. For everything, you know. I know you just wanna make me happy. Apologies accepted. And you made me happy for... twenty-five and a half days with these snacks I love! - Let's go to the moon! - Let's do it! Crew, helmets on and... Let's go! Begin countdown! Five... Four... Three... Two... Engines! I can't believe it! Gravity! Oh, my God, zero gravity! No! Watch out! Watch out! Why did you come here to tell me all this? I know what this squat means, Isabel. I really thought the firm wanted to help. It won't be possible. - Sorry. - Do you want me to forgive you? For helping to kick us out of here? No. I just wanted you to hear me out. I get you, Anna Júlia. You're only doing what's best for you. Go ahead. That's not new for me. Excuse me. There was a time in my life when the world said I needed to let go of a part of myself to be happy. And I believed it. But in my journey I learned that we can be more, have more. That we deserve everything, that we can be whoever we want to be. This song gives me the strength to move forward. And, today, I'd like to dedicate this song to a very special person. To someone who is making my night much happier. She is my world. For her, I am more. She's not a little girl anymore. She is a woman now. My daughter, Anna Júlia. I love you so much, Anna Júlia! I love you. I admire you! I believe in you! And, if you let me... I'll always be around. And I know that I was never a perfect mother. And I'll never be. Because I can only be who I am. But I am because of you. I'm all yours. - Alexandre. - Hi. - How are you? - Hi. Have a seat. Thank you. Shall we? The Constitution of 1988 provides that the right to property is guaranteed. And articles 1228 and 1231 of the Civil Code emphasize that it's the right of the owner to use it, enjoy it and dispose of it. And also to recover it from whoever obtained it unfairly. Guys! It's a pleasure to have you here! Enjoy the festival! But the same Constitution also says that every property must have a social function. In other words, it's an obligation inherent to the property that it meets social, public and not just private demands of the owner. That's how justice is, right? And this property does not serve any social function. I saw the pictures and videos of that place, of the abandonment before the squatters arrived. It was sad! It looked like a dump, full of bugs. And it also owed property tax. It's all here in this report. - Wes? - What's up? Brother! Which song will you play? The one he's ready to play, right? Of course! We need to concentrate here. I'm really nervous, and he comes here to bother us. Housing is also a constitutional right. You can't overlook that. No one is gonna stop this girl? Will she keep talking? Once, a person I admire a lot told me that we have to hack the system. And I believe it. But I also believe that we can have the same struggle and different strategies. I also want to hack the system, but by being true to myself, doing what I believe, with love and confidence! That's what my mom taught me. There's no way I can outrun it. It's inside me. And that's why I'm grateful for the time in this office, but I need to keep going. And if they take me back, I'll help defend the squat. What the hell? What's this? This is a joke! - What a mess. - Alexandre! - Since the beginning... - Alexandre, easy. The sun even shone that autumn. Of course I had to defend the squat. But I still had to take care of two things. Hello? I need to tell you something. I realized I'm going to be a great lawyer. Wanna go to a concert with me? And they say that autumn is always the same. Wonderful! I'm loving it! Good luck! And now I present you... João Pedro! The Hot Musician. João Paulo. Remember? Never mind. JP! I... I'll go to the movie screens, I'll go Tell my story, I will All my journey, I will And I am Happy? Everything time has done Much of what it's undone But I know now it's my turn I will I'll say I got a voice now The city will hear from me All that I realized - I remembered - I remembered - The first time I saw you - I saw you I got confused With your power, focus and lucidity Go! - You... - You... - Changed my world, yeah, it was right here - Here... - You're so much more than I expected - Expected... - You're the best song I ever heard - Heard... Who knows - If someone gives you chills, go! - Go... - If your philosophies match, go! - Go... - If you wanna see them every day, go! - Go... - Then go! - Go... - If someone gives you chills, go! - Go! - If your philosophies match, go! - Go - If you wanna see them every day, go! - Go I'm in! Awesome! Awesome! I didn't want to have to say this, but the judges decided to disqualify you because it's not the song you submitted. That's okay! I already have what I wanted the most. We can achieve anything else! See how much can happen in autumn? To wrap it up perfectly, there's just one thing that I love! Music! Go, the more you live the song Go, the more you understand Go, the more you live the song Open my heart Stick with me, understand Homies can't stop dreaming Life is intense and it's in our mind I became fast So I wouldn't burn myself Funk has arrived, it's samba and soul Our rhyme can't stop Come forward, stick with us Let's make Paulista pulse I follow my brilliance Singing, I know how it's done I feel more alive now and I want more Today I know who I am I am the result of this love Of the music that invades the chest I know that music has set me free I learned from love That the world changes this way Go, the more you live the song That the world changes this way Go, the more you understand That the world changes this way And you gotta take care of your heart Head and brothers You can't lack justice and passion I don't doubt it, no Without saying the direction I take the song and... Every now and then I improvise here and there They may even try to control They may not even understand us But now they'll have to put up with us Now they gotta pay to see it But it's for us not to forget That we deserve love and power We deserve to be able to love Don't forget, I told you Go, the more you live the song That the world changes this way Go, the more you understand That the world changes this way Go, the more you live the song That the world changes this way Go, the more you understand That the world changes this way An Unforgettable Year AUTUMN Tomorrow brings in memory Our history and one Brazil That we didn't hear Who sings to those who created it In the light of an unforgettable year One, two, three...
