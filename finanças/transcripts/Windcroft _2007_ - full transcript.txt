What kind of cats like Witty Whiskers? Doctor cats, robot cats, and even ghost cats love... John. Mr. Carlisle wants to see you. I'm going out for lunch. Can I get you anything? No. And even ghost cats love... All right. Well, I can come after lunch. 2:30? That should work out, okay. Thank you so much. All right, I'll see you later. Witty Whiskers laughing its way to a pet store near you. Looks like you're running away from something. I'm running away from the city for the weekend, that's for sure. With the Witty Whiskers account drawing so deathly near, I'm not surprised. You know, if Carlisle can leave early, so can I. He left? While you were on break. John, we're friends, right? Can I be honest with you? Of course. You've lost a lot of accounts lately, big accounts. Do you think this is such a good idea, now? I mean, people are starting to talk. And you know who isn't so happy. I'm not running away from my responsibilities here, and Carlisle knows that I'm leaving. Actually, he even said he thought it would be a good idea for me. What do I know, I'm just your secretary. Enjoy the long weekend, and you have the number upstate if you need me. Okay. Man, you're in early today. What, are you getting a jump on the three day weekend there? Diane and I are going up to Jack's old place. Sort through some stuff, check the place out. Damn, you haven't been up there in a long time. Yeah, it's just not my speed. ♪ Just listen to the rain ♪ I have no idea what to do once I get up there. Do I save everything? Do I throw shit out? Do I sell the place? It's all a bit too much for me right now. Look, who says you have to do anything? You know, just go up there and check it out. Get the mail, water the plants, you know, benign things. Just keep it simple. Then you and Diane can just come right back here. Just come right back. You sound like Diane. What's really on your mind, Johnny? Look, come on, we're family, you can talk to me. Something's going on with me. I just feel... I don't know, maybe it's my job, I don't know. Come on, what is it, John? What, being VP of that big advertising joint, that's not good enough for you? I thought you loved the job. I fucking hate it. All right, fine. Then just do something else. Like what? Anything! You know, this is America, just follow your dreams. I haven't had dreams since I was a kid. And even then they were mostly nightmares about lobsters. Oh, boo fucking hoo. Go out and buy yourself a Porsche like every other guy in your situation. I'm not going through a mid-life crisis. Yeah, you know, that's what your father said just before he crippled me with that buckshot. Hello, sweetheart. Hello, Murray! Sorry I'm late, honey. Traffic is miserable right now. No problem. It's good to see you. Same here. Here's yours, doll. Oh, thanks. Have you ever been to the farm, Murray? Johnny's father and I, we both got jobs back at that sawmill up there. I was there 10 years. I was only 30 and I practically ran the place. Why did you leave? I was at a time in my life when I started to question different paths I'd taken along the way. I was at a crossroads. And everybody reacts different to that, like me, I felt I was cornered, I just had to get out. 'Cause you know, if you're not in the right place at the right time, and if you're not in the right state of mind, you can react like a wild animal inside of a trap. And that can be really hard on some people. That's the last roll from Paris. Oh, I love that one. Oh, let me see that one. Ugh! I look terrible. Definitely not the Christmas card. Are you thinking about your dad? I guess. Well, I know you don't like to talk about him, but it might help. You're gonna have to start dealing with it sooner or later, John. You can't keep all this inside about how you're feeling about his death. I know this has to be hard on you, and if you don't want to talk to me, then you should talk to someone else. John, John. John, John, John. John! What? I'm sorry. Forget it. Do you mind if I turn on the radio? ♪ Witty Whiskers, chicken and fishes ♪ ♪ Witty Whiskers, so delicious ♪ Well, here we are. It is beautiful here. Maybe we should see what it's like outside the car. Hey, thanks for driving. Horses! John, you didn't tell me that the horses were still here. I didn't know they were. Aw. Well, who's been taking care of them? Your father's been... They look great. Are you cold? A little bit chilly, yes. I bet it'll be freezing tonight. Well, the heat's off, and so is the water. I tell you what, I'll go out and grab some logs for the fire if you go downstairs and turn on the water. The basement door- No, no, no, no, no. I'll get the logs, you go down to the basement. Chicken-shit. There's a log pile out back, grab some twigs for kindling. Be careful of the wild animals. Wild animals? You're full of shit. John, are you down there? Don't fuck with me if you are, I've been scared enough, thank you. Seriously, John? John! Where have you been? I was calling for you and looking all over. I was wrapped up in something, I guess I didn't hear you. What's wrong? Howling. Lots of howling. Don't worry about those nasty coyotes, I'll protect you. Protect me? You sent me to get firewood knowing full well that there were wolves outside. Coyotes. Whatever. The howling's actually very soothing if you really listen to it. It's kinda serene. I was almost eaten. Come here. Come here. Look what I found. Is there baby pictures in there? Mhm. I've always wanted to see baby pictures of you. These are your parents, right? Yep, that's them. Aw, look how young you are. Ooh, what a cutie. I was 16 years old in that picture. You must've driven the cheerleaders wild. Yeah, right. Oh, who's she? She's adorable. That was my neighbor from up the road here. Mindy's father did most of the groundswork here on the farm. Jack, we let him harvest the hay and work the horses and raise a few cattle. I don't know, farmer stuff. You were a strapping young lad, why didn't you handle the farm stuff? Too busy taking the farmer's daughter for a roll in the hay? Yeah, that's real funny. There's a lot of pictures of her in here. Well, she was very close with the family. She did everything for us. Were these your grandparents? Yep, on my father's side. Did you know them? My grandfather briefly. My grandmother died before I was born. She hung herself not long after that picture was taken. Oh, God, that's terrible. God, your mother and your grandmother. I can't even imagine. It's not really that uncommon, you know. Dementia and suicide to run through the female genes in the family. I'm sorry, John, I didn't mean- No, it's fine. Ah, look! I know that cute ass anywhere. Come here, come here. John? John? Beautiful, isn't it? Jesus, you scared the hell out of me. Yes, it is beautiful. It's creepy, but beautiful. Hop inside. Inside there? Yeah, inside there, it's a whole different view. I feel dizzy, I need to get out of here. All right, let me show you the backyard. It's so peaceful up here. I actually woke up in the middle of the night, and I couldn't get back to sleep. It was too quiet. Unbelievable. I'm glad you like it. Who lives there? That's Winston's house. You know the guy I was telling you about that used to do all the farm stuff? Oh, the farm stuff. Is anyone there now? I don't know. I want to see the horses. Hi. I'll bring you some apples later. Ow! No, no! Don't even... Don't you... Yeah, that one's fun and all, but this is more my style. Yah! No! Ow! Yeah... Keep running! You're gonna get it. No! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Looks like I have you cornered. John! John? Oh... You son of a bitch, you scared me half to death. Want a hayride? No, wait. Bring the whip. So, what do you want to do tomorrow? It's supposed to be a beautiful day. Who told you that? The Farmer's Almanac. Eh, I think I'll fix the place up a bit. There are a few things I'd like to take care of. Such as? Eh, change a few light bulbs, get the place ready for winter. And there's part of the fence behind the barn that's falling down. It'd be pretty easy for the horses to get out, I should fix that. When did you notice that? When we were up in the hay. Oh, really? You had some free time to look around, did you? It was when we were leaving. Uh huh, sure. Guess I'm gonna have to try harder to keep your attention. Don't worry, they won't come near us. They're more frightened of us than we are of them. Speak for yourself. Well, I'll be. The prodigal son returns. Wow, you look... Really, really terrific. Thanks. Not so bad yourself. Look like you haven't changed a bit. I'm sorry about Jack. Yeah. Listen, Mindy, about- Stop it. We were just kids and- - John. - I didn't know any better, and it doesn't make it right. We were kids, John. Relax. I didn't want to hurt you. I know. But hell, I would've left if I were you. So, are you here for good now? No, no, I'm just here for a few days, and I'm not here by myself. I'm here with my wife, Diane. A wife, really? That's interesting. I wish you both the best of luck. Have you mentioned me? I told her that we grew up together. The girl next door. Fucking Judas, you haven't changed, have you? Don't act so surprised, I didn't even know you'd still be here. What else am I gonna say? I don't know, the truth, maybe? Yeah, maybe. I can't get over it. You really look absolutely terrific. Well, I've been busy working my tail off running these two farms by myself, and working for Jack was no picnic, I can tell you that. Before he died he said you'd be coming back here. He said that? I haven't spoken to him in years. I didn't believe him for a second, but... I'm so sorry that you had to do this all by yourself. Yeah, they're pretty funny. Obviously, we had... John, you didn't tell me that Mindy's the one taking care of the horses. I just found that out myself. Hello, Mindy. She's also living in that house behind the lake. Well, it is her house, after all. It's 10:30 in the morning, John. I was just telling Diane about the time you broke your leg climbing a horse. It's great to see you again, Mindy. Are you gonna be all right with this? Yeah, I'm just being a baby. I'm not afraid to go in there. You're terrified. I'm terrified. Would you like my help? No. I'd like to do this on my own. Hi, you've reached the Dupree family. No one can come to the phone right now, leave your name and number, and someone will get back to you. Mindy's lovely. We really hit it off. Hello? Diane to John, come in, John. I'm sorry, were you talking to me? No, it doesn't matter. Of course it matters, what were you saying? No, no really, it's nothing. Just go back to your book. I think it's important. But if you say it's not, I won't argue. I was just saying that I think Mindy is nice. Oh, Mindy, yeah, no, she's great. I'm glad you two got along. I invited her for dinner tonight. You know, she's in that house all alone. Yeah, that was very kind of you. So, how long have you two known each other? Um, I don't know, since we were pretty young. 10-11, maybe? Oh, so you really grew up together? Yeah, pretty much. Did you two have a childhood romance? Diane, please. No, really! I mean, I don't care. I'm just curious. You know, when we were growing up, sure. We fooled around a little bit, but that was I don't know, so- Did you sleep together? Diane, we were teenagers. So you did then. I don't care, I mean it was so long ago. It was so long ago. Do you still have feelings for her? Jesus, please, is this necessary? I just wanted- No, I don't. Do you still have feelings for everybody you ever fucked when you were 16? Right. Can we just drop this? There's no need to get defensive, I was just curious. Oh, John's embarrassed! Look at him blush. Cheers, everyone. - To new friends. - And old ones. It must be so hard working this land, especially all by yourself, I don't know how you do it. Oh, I don't really do it much anymore. I do what I can. I get help during harvest season, of course. Well, it just feels so right, so organic. You know, reaping harvests, tilling. I wouldn't know the first thing about reaping and tilling, but I just love the sound of it. It does have a nice ring to it, I guess. You know, I grew up in this environment, it's what I know. So, John tells me that you teach children. Was it first grade? Third. God, so small, and young, and dependent. Must be good practice for having kids for your own. Well... We have been trying. Well, God, that's a huge... Exciting, huge step. Does John want to be a father? Oh, you know him, he's so indifferent to everything until it happens. But he has mentioned his preference for a girl though. I think John's gonna be a wonderful father. Sure. I'm sure he will be. Ugh, Mindy, this is spectacular. Yeah, I love the light in these woods. John and I used to come here a lot as kids. I thought that you would appreciate it. Oh, I do, I do. You know, I'm gonna come back here and paint this in the morning. God, you and John must've had some really great times growing up here. There's just so many beautiful places to go. Most of the time we were trying to get away from Jack. He hated me. Really? He hated all of John's girlfriends. All of them. You know, John really wasn't allowed to see any girls. When we met, he told me that I was his first in a long time. I don't doubt it. Jack has a lasting effect on people. Did you two get along? I never met him. Oh, no? John and I met and married pretty quickly. He didn't even invite him to our wedding. I understand. John told me they just didn't get along. Well, that too. Before you go, I'll take you to a few more places like this. If you'd like, that is. I would love it. You know, I'm not too sure how much longer we're gonna be here though. I'm surprised that John's gotten this much time off of work. Benign things. Benign things. John! John. How was it? It was fantastic. Mindy showed me all the other farms, we went down along the Delaware River. Oh, John, it was so beautiful. I'm gonna take my kit there tomorrow. Oh, I'm glad you had a good time. I'll tell you about it later, I'm gonna take a bath, I feel all sweaty and horse-y. Oh, I should probably help Mindy first though. No, I'll do that. Go in, have a bath. Thank you. Muah! You're a saint. You've got yourself a great little girl there. Thank you. Don't fuck this one up. Thanks. You know, Mindy, I've really missed you. I've been thinking about you a lot lately. About us, about the old days. We had some good times. Why'd you put the picture up? I found it in the closet. I like it. He built this place from scratch. It's held together with his sweat and blood. I cannot get over how wonderful it was to ride today. You looked great on that horse. A real natural. Oh, stop it. No, really, you did. It's a bit like riding a bike. I felt comfortable after a few minutes. It helps to have nice horses. Were your parents good riders? Yeah, when my mother was alive. I wish I could've met them. You would've liked my mother. But Jack, he was tough love. I'm a girl he would've liked though, right? Jack didn't like anyone. Only this farm. I think it's done us both some good to get away from the city. Well, we're supposed to be heading back tomorrow. I'll call Carlisle and see what I can do about staying a little while longer. He'll never give you the time off. You're the only person in that lonely old man's life. I can handle Carlisle. Since when? If I ask, he'll say yes. He'll have to. Thanks. My pleasure. I didn't see the car out front, I didn't think that you'd be here. Diane's by the river painting. Oh, right. I forgot. Stop it. Stop it! What are you... Stop it! Who are ya callin'? Carlisle. I'm gonna ask him if we can... Hi, Sandra. Yeah, it's me, John. Yeah, everything's great. Actually, no, I really don't want my messages, I'd like to speak with Carlisle. Thank you, Sandra. Good morning, sir. Yes, no, everything's fine. Yeah, she's here, she's standing right next to me. Sure, I'll send her your love. Yeah, about why I'm calling. I was kind of hoping maybe I could take the rest of the week off. Uh huh. Oh, okay. Right. Oh, great, I appreciate this. All right, so if you have any problems, if anything comes up, Sandra knows how to reach me. Okay, all right. I'll see you next Monday. That was easy. I guess he was in a good mood. Hey, I asked, he said yes, I won't question it. Now we have the rest of the week to spend here. John? Are you in here? What do you say we take a drive this week? You know, just go camping this week, just you and me? It's just you and me right now. Oh, hardly. Your mind's been preoccupied with this farm than anything else. I mean, I understand why we're here and that this is therapeutic, but I just thought a little time away from the city, away from this farm, it might be fun, I don't know. Look, I have to stay and finish this work. I'm not going anywhere. You can go. John, come on. I think it would be good for us. You know, we could cookout, roast marshmallows. Roast marshmallows? I don't think so. Fine. What was that? What was what? You must've heard that. Sometimes the howling sounds like that. It's a mating call or something. That was no mating call. Good morning, sleepyhead. What's with the thunder stick, cowboy? Just messing around out back. Sighting it in, shooting at squirrels. You know I hate those things. Me too, that's why I was shooting at them. You know what I mean. I'm very safe with it. That's not the point, and you know it. I can't even believe you'd have one in your hands. There's nothing wrong with a healthy appreciation of guns. It runs in my family. Yeah, healthy violence in your family? Doubt it. What would you know about my fucking family? Mindy! Mindy, are you there? It's me. Mindy? Hi. Could you wrap these for me, please? Sure. John! John. What is it, Diane? Well? Are you... Oh my God, wow, that's- John, isn't this incredible? Of course, it's what you've always wanted. We're a family. Mindy? It's Diane, are you in there? Mindy, are you okay? It was really strange. She must've heard me. Maybe she was busy. She was just sitting there. Maybe she wasn't home. Are you even listening to me? I saw her. I'm sure everything's fine, I wouldn't worry about it. It's getting colder. Yeah, winter will be here in no time. Let's see, it's October now, so 8 months. It'll be June. Luckily I'll be on summer break when the baby's born. You're gonna go back to work? Of course. Maybe I'll take a semester off. Take the whole year. And leave you to bring home the bacon? I can handle it. And then when you go back to work, I'll take a year off. I really love you, John. I'm so happy. I really wanted this. I'm also happy it's yours. Who else would it belong to? Oh, shut up. Baby, not like that. I meant that... I'm having a baby, with you. You know, Diane, I'm excited about this too. But I can't help but... Why not take it easy, really? Take it easy? It's just that it's early yet. I just don't know if it's so wise to count our chickens before they're hatched, so to speak. You're a fucking asshole. Hey. Why aren't you answering the door? Leave me alone! And you know I've been worried sick about you. Stay away from me! What's the problem? What's the problem? Hey. You can talk to me. Look... Mindy, about what happened between us the other day. I can't go on like this. I can't continue lying and sneaking around. Diane and I are trying to start a family. We've not teenagers anymore, and what we've been doing is wrong. There are adult lives at stake now. What are you saying? What I'm saying is that we can't continue this affair. Look, I don't love you- You son of a bitch! You can't just come back here after 10 years and start fucking with my head! Not with your fucking wife down there! I won't have it! I won't have it. I won't have it! Why are you doing this to me? How many times can you fuck me over? You left me here to take care of everything by myself. How much more am I supposed to take? I love you. Stop. No, I love you, and you love me. We were meant to be together. We were meant to be together, you know that. Don't deny it. Don't deny us. Listen to me. What we have is very special, and I'll never forget it. But I have responsibilities now. Mindy, calm down. You. I know you didn't fall too far from that fucked up tree! Why do you think you came back here, huh? To clean out his stuff? You're not fooling anyone. Mindy, calm down. Get the hell out of my house. Mindy- Get the fuck out of my sight! Oh my.. I'm gonna go pick up some supplies, do you need anything? No, I'm all right. What happened to your neck? Oh, barbed-wire. I'll survive. You should be more careful. There's some iodine in the bathroom, you might want to clean it up a little. Sure, I will. Okay. I'll be back in an hour or so. John? Diane? Murray. I thought I heard a car pull in, what brings you up here? John, my boy. You're here. I didn't see your car, and nobody was answering my calls. I haven't been here in many, many years, and it looks exactly like I remember. Your father took good care of this place. What brings you around, Murray? Listen, John. Why don't we go for a walk? Show me around, would ya? Of course. You know, I'm building a fence back behind the barn. I'll show it to ya. There's a great view from the halo. You know, I thought I would get lost driving down here, it's been such a long time. But it's a funny thing, I remembered every turn as I approached it. And I can't remember what I had for supper last night. Odd thing the mind is, isn't it, John? You never did tell me what you were doing here. It plays such devilish tricks on ya. Your father had some issues like that. I don't mean memory loss, I mean he was as sharp as a tack, your father was. Murray. John, listen. The police were at the bar, and they were asking about you, I tried to call you to tell you and I got no answer. I tried to leave messages, I just had to come over here and make sure you were all right. This is a beautiful time here. The change of leaves, some old hay. John, look, look. I came here to help you. Now, I didn't tell them where you were, but they're gonna figure it out sooner or later. Am I getting through to you? You know, Mindy, remember her? She knows all this herself. It's amazing. Wow, Mindy? She's still here? God, John, what's going on? You know, I think everything's gonna be all right. You see? This is where I've been building this fence I was telling you about. Hello? Hi, you've reached the Dupree family. No one can come to the phone right now... You're probably off canoeing or whatever people do in the middle of nowhere. You'll never believe it. Carlisle's late this morning. John, it's Sandra again. It's really weird, Carlisle hasn't been in for two days. I don't know what to do about these accounts. Give me a call back. John, it's Murray. Call me at the bar when you get this, it's important. John, Carlisle's dead. They found him in the closet in his fucking office. I'm sitting in here for two fucking days with him in there. The cops are here. You better call back. It's Murray again. I'm in Danville, I'll be there in an hour. I hope to see you then. You've reached Murray Dupree. I can't get to the phone right now, but leave a message and I'll get back to you, most likely. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? - Who you callin'? - Nobody, no one. Um, well, Mindy but... She's not there. Why is everyone so jumpy today? I'll make lunch. Are you all right? You look a bit pale. Oh, maybe I need to take a walk. The fresh air, my... You're kinda warm. You know, you should go upstairs and lie down. I'll put the rest of these groceries away and then I'll bring you up some tea. I think a walk and some air is what I need. No, it's not. Rest is best. Go on. Diane. John? Are you home? Are you home? John, stop! Stop it! Please, John, why are you doing this? Stop it, put me down! Please! Look at me, John, look at me! Put me down! What are you doing? John, stop! Stop it! Oh, John, no! No, no, no! What are you doing? Stop, stop, please, no! No, John! He's trying to hurt me. Why is he trying to hurt me? Because he has to. It's what he came here for. Don't listen to her, sweetheart. She's jealous. Open your mouth again, John. I'm here to end it once and for all. End what? Don't listen to her, Diane. She's sick, she's just like her mother, she's all fucked up in the head and delusional. This family, our family has a history, and you were about to be another part of it. Our family? She won't understand. Just shut up! She doesn't have to. She only has to know that I am gonna put an end to this long spoiled blood. It doesn't end with me. Diane? Sweetheart? Are you in here? Look, I'm sure you're really confused, but if you come out, we can talk about this. My brother, I'm sure he didn't tell you everything. I don't want to see anyone else hurt. I'm not the damaged one in the family, I'm innocent! Like my mother. And like my mother, I did what I had to do to get my brother back here. I knew you just weren't figured into the equation, and I'm sorry. But now... It just has to stop. Please. Diane? We have to take care of your little problem. I know it hurts, but it's for the best. If you come out, we can take care of this together. And you can live a normal life, and try again. Diane! Oh, please... Please. Please, please, no. Who's there? Who's there? Who is that, John?
