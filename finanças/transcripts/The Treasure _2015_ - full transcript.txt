THE TREASURE Are you upset, son? - A bit. - Why? Because you were late to pick me up. - But why do you think I was late? - Because of the traffic. So if you know why I was late, why are you still upset? Because I thought you did it on purpose. Have I ever made you wait on purpose? No. Robin Hood is never late! He just hides. You’re not Robin Hood, and you weren’t hiding. You’re right. Sorry I was late. I forgive you. It was a very dangerous place for anyone who entered. King Richard lived happily with his daughter, Maid Marian. But Richard’s jealous brother, Prince John, wanted only one thing: to seize the throne. The day came when the enemies of England declared war, and Richard had to leave to fight. The cruel and greedy- Look at him! Prince John suddenly seized power and sent his soldiers across the kingdom. And where- The neighbor from the 4th floor wants a word with you. - Which neighbor? - Negoescu. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Sorry to disturb you. - No problem. Well, maybe it’s out of order, but I have a problem I wanted to discuss with you. - Come into the kitchen. - No, I don’t want to keep you long. - What’s up? - I need to borrow some money. - How much? - 800 euros. I can repay it in a month, maybe two. I’m sorry. I don’t have it. 700? I don’t even have 700. I’m struggling right now. I’m desperate. I don’t know what to do. The bank's going to repossess my house. - How much was the mortgage? - 76,000 euros. - That’s a lot. - The interest alone is 17,000. - When did you take it out? - In 2006. - When did you last pay? - About 3 years ago. You should keep up with the repayments, or they get out of hand. I paid the principal. It’s the interest that's killing me. - What’s the rate? - 13%. - 13%? Why so much? - That was the deal. - Swiss Francs? - No. Euros. I was an idiot. 7 or 8%, I could manage. Mine’s 8%, which seems a lot. When you have a salary, when you’re working, it’s easier to cope. - But since my company closed... - What company? I had a publishing house. It went bankrupt. It was going really well. Then the financial crisis hit and it all went to hell. A survey said only 2% of Romanians read more than one book a year. - In fact, I didn't publish books. - No? I made brochures, leaflets for promotional campaigns. I see. I made a book for the Orthodox Church, but it didn’t earn us much. But the promotional campaigns brought in good money. Then the crisis hit and it all went to hell. Neighbor, I’m really sorry but I can’t help. 800 euros is a lot for me right now. I've got repayments on my car and my apartment. I really can’t. - I understand. - I'm really sorry. - Sorry to have disturbed you. - Not at all. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. “If you’re scared, I’ll go alone!” “Alone? Of course not!” cried his comrades. The day of the celebration came. In a clearing stood the stage for the archery competition. Prince John sat down. Maid Marian stood behind him. Disguised as a beggar, a big hat pulled down over his face, Robin Hood took to the stage. His eyes met those of the Maid… Can you come a minute? He wants to tell you something. You carry on reading. - From where? - Here. There is a legend in my grandparents' village. They say my great-grandfather buried his treasure before the Communists came. I want to hire a metal detector guy to see if anything's there. If you pay, I’ll give you half of whatever we find. Did someone in your family tell you this? My grandfather mentioned something, but he wasn't very clear. I remember... when they took him to hospital, before he got into the ambulance, he called me over and said: “Take care of the house.” He only said it to me. I was his favorite. He loved me a lot, and wanted me to be a priest. My grandfather was a priest himself. Sadly, he never came back from the hospital. - He had a heart attack and died. - God rest his soul. I'm thinking that when he said: “Take care of the house”, maybe he was saying take care, because there’s treasure there. Does your mother or father know anything? My father never got along with my grandfather. He was my mother's father. I asked my mother, but she didn’t know anything. You said your great-grandfather buried the treasure, right? - Yes. - So why didn’t he dig it up? - Who? - Your grandfather. He couldn’t, because they didn’t live there anymore. In ’47, the Communists kicked them out of the house. They were deported to Caracal for 4 years, then they came back and stayed with relatives and neighbors. I only got the house back later, after the revolution. Around ’98. I think... this could be good business for you. I don’t have the money right now. I really don’t. I went to hire a metal detector. They asked for 800 euros. But if you can find it cheaper somewhere else… - Was your great-grandfather rich? - Yes, very. And your great-grandmother? - What about her? - Did you know her? - No, she died earlier, in the ‘50s. - I'll think about it and call you. Where will you get 800 euros? I have 300 in my account. If I don’t pay the bills this month, that’s another 200. Maybe you could ask your father for the rest. Why don’t you ask him yourself? You know he can’t stand me. It’s not that he can’t stand you. He doesn’t love you but he can stand you. Better if you ask. I’m not asking. He’ll say I’ve gone crazy. Tell him you need it for Alin at school, to buy him something. What? I think it's a once in a lifetime opportunity. I won’t call him. I’d rather wait until we really need it. - We’re talking about an investment... - No, we must discuss the environment, because it is protected by the constitution, in Article 35. The right to work is also constitutionally guaranteed. Article 41 of the constitution says the right to work is guaranteed. I see. OK. Let’s listen to Romanian Academy member Radu Rey. Our problem is sustainability. The Rosia Montana gold reserves are limited, they will run out. We’ve seen many terrible examples of these mono-industrial cities, or what remains of them. I've just come from Bazinul Dornelor, and I can still picture what sulfur extraction did to Calimani. You’ve never seen anything like this. We’ve tried to get things to grow back. It’s impossible, for 200 years, nothing will grow there. The level of pollution is like a global holocaust, to use a metaphor. What will happen to the mountains? You're a real defender of the mountains... - Any luck? - I found a company. I’ll call my dad tomorrow. - 300 euros? - Yes. - I'm going to bed. - I'll come soon. - Can you help me with something? - What? I need to go to… I want to tell the boss that I’m doing an inspection with you. - I don’t have time. - Come on. I helped you out before. Where do you want to go? I need to visit some companies that close at four. - What companies? - I can’t tell you. Come on, I helped you when you needed it for your niece. OK. - Hello, boss. - Hi, Costi. I need to go to 20 Moise Nicoara Street. We received a complaint from the residents’ association saying a landlord has built on public land. - Does he have authorization? - He says so. But the association says it’s illegal. OK. Go and take a look. - Who are you going with? - With Liliana, boss. OK. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Shall we go? - Did you figure it out? - Yeah. - Come on! - You're leaving? - Yes. - Are you coming back? - No. Turn right. Next, turn left. - Hello! - Hello. Looking for someone? - I need a metal detector. - An unexploded bomb? No. A friend's house in the country. He says his grandfather, no his great-grandfather, buried treasure. - What’s going on? - This gentleman needs a detector. - Hello. - Hello. - Come in. - This way. What’s the surface area? I don’t know. It’s very important. The price depends on the area. - Let me make a phone call. - Make your call. Hi. How big is the garden? Yeah, in the country. Great, thanks. I’ll call you later. Bye. It’s about 800 square meters. And where is it? - I don’t know. - It’s not in Bucharest? It’s near somewhere… - Hold on, I’ll call again. - Don’t bother. The price is 1 euro per meter, so it’s 800 euros plus VAT. Plus petrol money for the guy who comes with you. - And when can you come? - Anytime you want. As soon as you sign the contract and make the payment. - So I need to pay first? - Obviously. - Is the price negotiable? - No. - Can you do the weekend? - Weekends are ideal. We’ve got a big project on right now. I'll come with the money and sort it out then. - Can I take your number? - Sure. You know if you find old coins, you need to report them to the police. - Yeah? - Of course. They need to be inspected, and if they’re considered part of the national heritage, they remain state property. - I didn’t know. - It’s no joke. You must report it. If the police catch you, they’ll send you to prison. What if it isn’t coins? Doesn’t matter what it is. It could be crockery. Whatever you find must be reported. The police call someone from the nearest museum to inspect what you’ve found, and if they consider it part of the national heritage, they give you 30% of the total value. - They give 30%? - They do. And if it’s not of historical value? Then they give everything back. However, I think everything before WWII has historical value. I’m not certain, but they’re such smart-asses, they won't let much past them. OK. When you decide, and have the money, call me. - I’m Cornel. - Costi. I can come with you, if you like. It’ll only be 400 euros, plus money for diesel. Thank you. But I can only come at the weekend. There’s no one here, I can take the equipment I need. - I see. Thanks. - Here’s my card. Careful with the cards. They’re all the same. - I’m Cornel. - Cornel, got it. It’d be unfortunate if you called my boss. Don’t worry about the police if you're with me. I’ll scan the place, mark where there could be something, then leave. We don't call or know each other. If you find something it's your business. Thanks. Let me think and I'll call you. Hello. - Hello. Is your father home? - Yes. Please come in. The company said that if we find something, we need to report it to the police. And the state gives us 30% of its value. No. If we go and we find anything, then we get in the car, drive to Bucharest, and sell the gold to gypsies. They’ll melt it down, and nobody will know it used to be coins. If we don’t report it, I’m not coming. OK, we report it. I found someone. - He can only do the weekend. - Saturday would be perfect. How long will it take us to get there? An hour and a half, maybe two. - What’s the village called? - Islaz. 11km from Turnu Magurele. Sofronea hit him again. Really? This can’t go on, we should do something. We’ll move him next year. - Move him where? - Another class. He’ll still get hit during break. The teacher’s an idiot. I told her to keep watch during break. What does he do? Doesn’t he fight back? Apparently not. The best thing would be if you spoke to Sofronea’s parents. It can’t go on, he’s being traumatized. We’ll speak to them. It should be you, you’re the father. OK, I’ll speak to them. What should I do, tell his mum? Tell his father. Man to man. I’ve only seen him twice. His mum picks him up. OK. I’ll talk to his mum tomorrow morning. And I’ll tell the headmaster. Why do you want to tell the headmaster? I'll tell him the teacher isn’t doing anything. I told her a month ago and she did nothing. What do you think he’ll do? He’ll tell the teacher. She'll get annoyed, and in the end our boy will suffer. What can she do to him? Who knows? Not ask him questions, not listen, not ask him to write on the blackboard… You’re right. I’ll just talk to his mum. It's better that way. - Why did Sofronea hit you? - Don’t know. - What? You don't know? - Don't know. - You upset him? - No. Look at me. - Did you upset him? - No. - What were you doing? - Eating my sandwich at my desk. - And he came and hit you, right? - Yes. How did he hit you? - And what did you do? - I ran off. Was he playing? Did he hit you hard? He hit me hard. Next time, don't run off. Grab his hands. Go on, hit me. Grab his hands. Hold them tight and shout: - "Leave me alone!" - OK. "Leave me alone, or I’ll tell the teacher!" - Right? - Right. Come on, pretend I’m Sofronea. Say it loud to scare me! Leave me alone, or I’ll tell the teacher! Louder! Let’s see! Leave me alone, or I’ll tell the teacher! That’s it! Push him away and leave. Right? Yes. - But don't hit him. OK? - Yes. Just hold his hands, push him away and he'll leave you alone. - It’s not nice to fight, OK? - OK. - Right? - Yes. - Did you take a file from my desk? - What file? - There was a blue file. - Nobody touches your things. Did the girls take it? Where are they? On a field trip. - Good morning! - Good morning. - What happened yesterday? - The landlord didn’t show up. Damn taxpayers. Making us go out for nothing. Yeah… Bring that file and see me in my office. - A coffee? - Right away. Costi, don’t be long. I’ve a busy day today. Coming. I didn’t go on an inspection yesterday. - So where were you? - I went to hire a metal detector. What? My neighbor told me that his great-grandfather buried some treasure before the Communists came. I wanted to hire a detector to find the treasure. - Are you making fun of me? - No, boss, that’s what I did. I don’t get it. Why don’t you tell me the truth. - Why not admit it? Admit it! - It is the truth. Costi, do you think I don’t know you’re having an affair with Liliana? I'm not having any kind of affair with Liliana. Come on, we’re both men. I understand you. That’s life. It happens. But you’ve taken things too far. Don’t you think I’ve noticed you’re not pulling your weight? That recently you’re missing all your deadlines? Costi, your big mistake was mixing work up in this. Work and love don’t go together. Everything goes to hell. Boss, there's nothing going on with Liliana. Costi, are you making fun of me? I’m trying to be fair with you, and you’re treating me like this? - I have limits, you know! - It’s someone else. - Who? Someone here? - No. - She works for a private company. - What company? They hire out metal detectors. That’s why you told me about the treasure… Yeah. Costi, you’re a married man. You should remember that children are more important than anything. I hope you’re not thinking of a divorce. No, boss. How could I? Bad weather has already caused severe problems. Three cars were damaged this morning in Gala?i by a tree brought down by the wind. The owners could only look on and calculate the damage. Two of the cars... Did you check the weather for Turnu Magurele? - Cloudy with sunshine. - No rain? No. - What’s the village called? - Islaz. Wasn’t that where the proclamation of 1848 was made? Which proclamation? That’s where the Revolution of 1848 started. Yeah? Islaz, next to Turnu Magurele. - When do you leave? - Six. The Revolution of 1848 was started by the sons of rich landlords, who’d studied abroad and wanted to change Romania. If our neighbor is from one of those families, there’s a good chance there will be treasure. Was anyone in your family involved in the Revolution of ‘48? - The Proclamation? - Yeah. I don’t think so. My great-grandfather was the son of a very rich Greek, called Xantopol. The Greek sold everything he had on the eve of the War of Independence. - 1877. - Yes. He went back to Greece, to his family. But your great-grandfather stayed in Romania. Yes, he stayed in Romania. - Your grandfather was born in Islaz? - Yes. - And your great-grandfather? - Also in Islaz. Turn right. Next, turn left. In fact, my grandfather was adopted. My great-grandfather couldn’t have children, and so he adopted my grandfather. Turn left. Go straight on. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Hey, neighbor! - It's a beautiful house! Move the car so nobody can see it. - Shame it’s falling down… - My brother tried to do it up. - He ran out of money. - Your brother owns it too? It’s his house. This one is mine. There are two houses? There are now. In my grandparents' day, that was the house, these were the outhouses. This was a kitchen, the stables were back there. - Where were the stables? - Over there, at the back. - And you knocked them together? - Me? No, the Communists. They made a kindergarten here. See this archway? They filled it in. Good morning, Cornel. What's up? Where are you now? OK, no rush! Drive safely! Who was that? - The metal detector guy. - Anything wrong? He set off late. He’ll be here in an hour. - So this is your garden? - Yes. And that’s your brother’s. From here on it’s mine. And that's my brother’s. - Go on, move the car. - Where? I usually park here, by the walnut tree. But we’ll be using the metal detector there. Why would we use the metal detector there? If there’s any treasure, it’ll be here, by the mulberry. Why by the mulberry? That’s how they buried treasure. At the roots of a tree. There’s a tree here, too. It could be buried over here. This tree is 100 years old! - Was it struck by lightning? - Yes. 20 years ago. I dug back there but I didn’t find anything. - Is that a computer? - Yes. - How far down can it see? - 30 meters. - 30 meters down? - Yes. - At 30 meters we should find something. - Nails at least. At 30 meters we’ll reach the Roman Empire! Maybe even further back. Start. OK, let's go. - Can you see anything? - Not yet. When I turn around. We should have brought some barrier tape, like the police use. - Why? - To mark our route, so we don’t cover the same ground twice. - I told you on the phone. - I forgot. Want to see the image? - Where's the save icon? - It’s just a chart. Where’s the pointer? Ah, here. Here it is. It should have today’s date. The 24th, that’s the latest one. Come on! That’s today’s date! What the hell? I don’t get how it can see 30 meters down. That’s below the water table. It’s 21 meters here. - Where? - Back there. I’ve got a well 21 meters deep. - It sees water. - Sees water? Of course. - So, we need to save it... - I saved it. - Now press play. - What play? - Let me open this file. - There! Now press play. What the fuck? - Shouldn’t it beep? - Not this one. The other. - What other? - I’ve got another one. - And does that see things? - No. It just makes sounds. Come on! We’ve got a file, right? Look, here it is. Yes. This has today’s date. The 24th. It's the most recent, right? Here we have 'live'. Here’s 'peak'. It was 'peak', right? No! We should see the image with the cube. - What cube? - The 3D image. There’s this cube… OK then. We’ve got today’s date, right? Hold this. I’ll get the other one. Hold this. And this. So, here’s today’s date… Do you have a gold wedding ring? Hold your hand out. Got it. - Want to do the whole garden? - No. Just by the mulberry. - There’s metal here. - How deep does this one go? And here. - How deep does this one go? - About two meters. And here. Do non-ferrous metals sound different? - No, about the same. - So it’s everywhere… There’s something big here. There was a blacksmith and an electric company storeroom. - It’s a big area… - Nails everywhere. Zero. 1343. 1343. - This one has numbers? - Yes. 4 digits means ferrous, 3 means non-ferrous. Let’s try here. 364. It could be here, right? Gold. It could be gold, silver, copper. Or aluminum, if it was an electric company. 1624. 1023. I've got it! I've opened it. Come and see. The red is ore. The image is upside down. - We can rotate it. - So spin it around. Look. Stop! That’s the right image. See? But there’s nothing much and it’s deep down. There could be traces of ore in the soil. There’s no point digging here. - There's something here, too. - How do you know? If there’s a lot the chart goes red. - Shouldn’t we wait for the image? - Not necessarily. You only need the image to find out the depth. So why did I bother? Look. Here again. - Red means metal. - Yes. - But we don’t know what kind. - No. But the other showed 3 digits. - That means non-ferrous. - So? So it could be gold, could be silver, could be copper, or aluminum. Anything non-ferrous. - What does the blue mean? - Blue means normal. - And what does green mean? - Another kind of soil. And these figures here? I’m not sure about those. I usually use the other one. - This red is over there. - Yes. In that case, let's start digging. - And if we just find copper? - Tough luck. Let’s scan the whole garden. What if it shows other places? I agree. I’ll scan it all and mark where there could be something. - Then you can stay and dig. OK? - OK. In fact, here in Oltenia people hid money in the walls of houses. In the east wall, facing the rising sun. - How do you know? - I worked a lot in this region. I dug up hundreds of landmines around Caracal. - German? - Some of them. They’d make a hole in the wall, hide the coins and seal it up? No, when building a house, they’d put a few coins in the east wall for luck. But we’re not after change. We’re looking for treasure. Got it? Let’s scan, then see where to dig. We’re paying him anyway. OK, scan it, but we won’t find anything elsewhere. You can’t be sure. Let’s save this. - Did your great-grandparents stay here? - Yes. - What does your brother do? - He’s a lawyer. Is there soil under the floor? Yes, I think so. What will this room be? A bathroom and kitchen. Can you move this ladder, please? - Will he use plasterboard? - Yes, to make a false ceiling. It’s 3.6 meters high. Really hard to heat in winter. There’s metal here. And here. Perhaps there’s a cable, or a drain? Probably from the bar. This was a bar after the revolution. It’s definitely a drainage pipe. Strange you can't see it? If they'd taken up a board, you'd notice, right? I don’t know. Not my field. What should we do? Should I save this one? No point. It’s a drainage pipe. Let’s scan here too. Are they crows? - What else could they be? - There's a nest? Yeah, in the attic. There's a hole in the roof. How will you get them out? I’ll do it when we repair the roof. - That’s what you think. - If I repair the roof... You won’t be able to go in. They’ll eat you alive. - Don’t exaggerate. - I’m not exaggerating. Want to bet that you won’t be able to go in? I'm in no mood for betting. I’ll find a solution. Yes. Shoot them. - Just mind your own business. - Don’t worry, I will. - You really need to shoot them? - There’s no other way. You need a shotgun, and a cartridge with 100 rounds. Get them together, you can kill 30 or 40 with one cartridge. - There are that many? - In there? At least 100 pairs, if you ask me. - Really? - I’m telling you! You can also get them when they’re flying. If you get them in a flock, you can get 4 or 5 at a time. It’s like shooting ducks. - Ever hunted ducks? - No. You can get 2 or 3 with one cartridge. Of course, it depends how far off they are. If it’s a long way, the shot's less effective. That’s why I said it’s best to catch them inside. I had a maple over there, and they’ve cut it down. - Where? - Back there. Your garden goes back beyond the trees? Yes. - So how did they carry it? - They didn’t. It’s still there. But I have no idea how they got in. The gate is closed. Can you move back? - I’ll come for chainsaw later. - What for? I cut down that tree, and I need to chop it up. The loony's here with someone from Bucharest. They’ve got a machine that beeps. They’re after his grandfather’s treasure. He’s crazy. He won’t stay long. - Can I take it tomorrow? - Not tomorrow. - The day after? - Sure. - Anything? - No, it’s clean. Let’s dig where you said, before dark. Here… From here... to here. Under the sensor. Hi. We’ve started digging. Not yet, but we’re on the right track. The detector found something, and we’ve started digging. What are you up to? How’s Alin? Let me speak to him. No, not yet, son. I can’t talk for long, can you put Mommy on? You told him I’m looking for treasure? Come on, Raluca, what the hell! And what if I don’t find any? Couldn’t you tell him that I’m on a business trip, or fishing? Jesus! OK, we’ll talk when I get home. Fine. Move over! It’s there. - How deep did you say it goes? - 2 meters. So if we don’t find anything at 2 meters, there’s nothing. I don't know. We’d have to try then and see. Or bring the other one. So, if we dig for 2 meters, and don’t find anything? - We try the detector again? - Yes. And if it shows 3 digits, you’ll make us dig more? - I’m not making you do anything. - Don’t avoid the question. I’m not avoiding anything. If the detector shows something, I’ll tell you, and you can do what you like. I think... If there’s nothing there, your detector is to blame. It’s a first class detector. Come on, let’s dig to 2 meters and see. See what? If there’s nothing at 2 meters, there’s nothing there. If we dig down 2 meters and find nothing, there won’t be anything at 50 meters either. - Are we digging, or what? - But doesn’t it make sense? It makes sense. But we can also try with the other one. It’s there. But you need to take more from the sides. Anyway, your grandfather dug the hole in one night. How deep could he dig in one night? 2 meters at most. Like Cornel says. - Want to bet? - Bet what? You find something deeper than 2 meters, we go 50-50? I’m not in a betting mood. Then stop having a go at me. - Why so many bricks? - I don’t know. - There was a brickworks here. - You said it was a steelworks? It was a brickworks and a steelworks. - A lot went on in this garden. - And now there’s nothing. But it's OK. If we don't find anything here, you can sell this iron and make a bit of money. If we don’t find anything, it’s only fair that you don’t get paid either. - Why shouldn’t I get paid? - You made us dig for nothing. I worked all my life. I didn’t go running after treasure. - A real Communist slogan! - What do you mean? The Communists used to say: “We work, we don’t think”. - They didn’t quite say that. - No? You've already forgotten? I haven't forgotten. But I was referring to something else. You let the cat out of the bag. Forget it. Now you’re pissing me off. Watch your language, don’t forget you’re in my garden! There. It’s there. Stop scanning every bit of wire. You’re making my head ache. - I wanted to see if it’s iron. - You still don't know? Fine. I’ll stop scanning. You’ll need a ladder here. I’ll get the one from your brother’s. Get the light, too. It’s pitch black, I can’t see a thing. - Want a hand? - No. It's there! How deep do you think it is? - How tall are you? - 1.91 meters. - So about 1.80... - Maybe more, maybe less. - There’s no more iron here. - Perfect. - That means we’re on the right track. - Or not. You can be really negative! Do you look for bombs with that piece of crap? Yes. Why? - Just thinking. - Thinking what? Why do you care what I’m thinking? You work, you don’t think. Now you’re really pushing it. Don't talk to me like we’re in the army, you’re pissing me off. Costi! Costi! I’m leaving. Go then. Shut your mouth, you didn't hire me. Did you hear? I’m leaving. - Wait, let me dig a bit more. - Let him go! We can dig without him. - So why didn’t you dig? - Just because. Get the other one, and see what it says. You can’t put the other one in the hole. It needs a flat surface. Just admit you don’t know how to use it! To use the other one you need a flat surface. This one tells me exactly what’s here. And it shows 3 digits! - What the hell do 3 digits mean? - 3 digits non-ferrous. So you say. You just want our money. It’s what it says. Three means non-ferrous, four means ferrous. What's so bloody complicated? Why would I lie? Simple. To get our money. Even if I said there was nothing in the hole wouldn’t I still get paid? I’m going. Costi? - Costi? - Yes? - I’m going. - Where? I’m going. Home. - Let me dig some more. - I’m not staying any longer. - I’ve had enough of this guy. - And we’ve had enough of you. Shut your mouth, or I’ll knock you out! What? You’ll do what? Hey! What’s wrong with you? Give me a hand, help me out. If you’re not careful, maybe we’ll meet in Bucharest. - And you’ll do what? - Calm down! You’ll see... I told you he’s got money problems. They're repossessing his house. We’ve all got problems. You’ve got problems, I’ve got problems. A man makes his own problems. They don’t descend from heaven. You’re right. Could you stay a little? I’m going. If I stay, I’ll punch him. Come on, hand it over so I can leave. Hand it over. - Sorry it ended like this. - That’s the way it goes. - How much for the diesel? - Forget the bloody diesel! - Come on, how much? - Forget it! - Thank you. - All the best! Neighbor! Let’s go. There’s nothing here. Let’s go. Can you hear me? Are you OK? Is there something there? Give me the light. There's a thief I know. He’ll have it open in two minutes. Be patient. He’d go straight to the police. No coins in here. Let’s call Lica. - Lica? - The thief I mentioned. Better to go back to Bucharest and try to open it there. Good evening. Your papers, please. - Good evening. - Good evening. We were just coming to see you. We’ve found some treasure, and, as the law says, I understand it needs to be checked. - So you know what the law says? - Yes. Why didn’t you call us straight away, if you know what the law says? We don’t know it that well. - Where is the treasure? - In the trunk. You go with my colleague, and I’ll go with you. Let’s go. Come on, Lica! My wife will think I’m having an affair. I said it’d take a while. I just only got the soil out of the lock. Not long now. - Done many of these? - Not like this. It’s really old. Maybe you should find a new line of work. Who told you? - Told us what? - That we were digging. You were going to tell us anyway. - Right? - Yes. I just wondered. Was it Popa? Enough questions, you’re starting to annoy me. 4 o'clock. I’ll call Turnu Magurele to take over. Yeah. You’re open, you fucker. Hey! Careful, careful! - What are these? - Something in German. Are they all the same? They’re Mercedes share certificates. How do you know? It’s written on them. Mercedes shares. I had a job in Germany and stole some, but from KRUP. They’d expired, so I sold them to a collector, 100 euros each. 100 euros? Not bad! Look how many there are. These don’t count as national heritage. - I don’t know. We’ll see. - They definitely don't. Heritage artifacts must be connected to Romanian culture, connected to the country, to Romania. I need to call Bucharest. - They’re from ‘69? - Yeah. - Where does it say that? - There, issued in 1969. - Impossible. - Why impossible? “Issued in '69”. I know German. We done, boss? Yes, Lica, you can go. Sit down. - I’ll make that call to Bucharest. - Yes. …145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152 153, 154, 155, 156, 157. 156 divided by 2... 78, - One left over. - Yes. We’ll share it when we sell it. - Want to keep it? - I don’t understand. Will you keep it, or should I? Leave them here, we’ll share them in Bucharest. OK. Who could have buried them? The Communists? How could the communists have shares in Mercedes? Could they have been buried after the Revolution? There were two bars. One in my brother’s place, with gambling machines, and another in mine... a strip-bar. There were all kinds of shady characters there. It was the most famous bar in the county. You think one of those guys buried them? But why didn’t he dig them up again? Maybe he died. Daddy... - What have you got there? - The treasure. - What’s up, big guy? - I'm fine. - What are those? - Mercedes shares certificates. - Where’s the treasure? - Here it is, son! But where are the crystals, rubies, gold, silver? - Let’s go and brush your teeth. - Where are they? You keep treasure in the bank, not at home. - Can I see it too? - Yes. Tomorrow. It’s Sunday today, and the banks are closed. - I’m going to see the treasure! - Come on, brush your teeth. - Will there be gold? - Yes. - And silver? - Silver too. And crystals? Emma Dumont. - Constantin Toma. - Adrian Negoescu. Please, take a seat. I’ve checked the share. The current market value is 15,075 euros. My assistant tells me you intend to sell? - Yes. - Yes, absolutely. - Who is the owner? - We both are. - Who will sign the contract? - Either of us. We charge a 7% transaction fee, which will be deducted from the share price. - Is this OK? - Yes. - Could I sell another four? - Of course. I’d like to sell another four too. - These are yours? - Yes. One moment. I need to check the serial numbers and I don’t want to mix them up. Of course. - You are Mr. Constantin… - Constantin Toma. - And these are yours? - Yes. - Four? - Yes, exactly. Sorry, I’ve forgotten. Your name, please? Adrian. - Adrian? - Adrian Negoescu. It’ll take a while to check the validity of the shares. - No problem. There’s no rush. - We’ll wait. There’ll be the same 7% transaction fee. Not a problem. My assistant will take your details and draw up the contracts. - OK. - We’ll wait here. - It was a pleasure meeting you. - Likewise. 78 times 15,075 equals 1,175,850 euros. - That much? - Yeah. Now, divided by... - Minus the bank commission? - I forgot the commission. - Divided by three... - Why three? I’ll need to give some to my mother, and brother. Listen. If he comes looking for you, tell him I just gave you 10 shares. - Why? - He wouldn’t want to give you half of it. - Why didn’t he go look for it himself? - Just say that and forget about it. - What could he do? - He could sue us. - Could he? - Yes. The land's in my mother’s name. They could accuse us of theft. That one. That one. That one. - That one. - One moment. - So, this one? - Yes. And? And this one. - I'll put them here. - That one. That one. The earrings. And? That one. - Shall I add it up? - Yes. But I’ll take more. Thank you. So... 2,560 and 1,860 1,530 for the brooch. - And 3,889… - And this. And this. Yes. This and this. And this. - Now you can tell me the total. - Of course. Let’s take a seat. Can you help me? This way. - Would you like a coffee? - Yes. With milk? Without. - Where’s Alin? - Over there, on the slide. - Alin, come and see something. - Leave me alone. - Come to see something. - Let me play. - Come on! - What? - Come and see! - You brought it from the bank? - Yes. - Come on! He found the treasure! He found the treasure! What treasure? - You want to see it? - Yeah! - Are you sure? - Yeah! Wait! Wait a second. 1, 2, 3 and...! - Can we touch it? - Yes. - Can I take it home? - Yes. Hey! Give it back! - Thief! - Leave me alone! - Give me back my treasure! - No! You’ve got lots! I don’t have any!
