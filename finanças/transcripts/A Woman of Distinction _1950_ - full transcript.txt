This is Susan Manning Middlecott, one of the greatest educators in the country. He belongs to one of the richest and most respected families in New England. A child prodigy, she excelled in everything. His school résumé was in the news. His grades, the highest in local history. The university curriculum was even better. He graduated summa cum laude in the humanities, becoming master and doctor consecutively. With so much learning, he decided to teach, which she did brilliantly, until interrupted by the War... where he served with dedication and courage until the day of victory. After the war, he dedicated himself to the rehabilitation of French war orphans.... work for which she was decorated by the French government. A unique honor bestowed on few women during the War. Upon returning, it had become a national symbol. A few years later, she was appointed dean of Benton College. In an interview while completing her first year as dean of Benton College, Miss Middlecott expressed his principles by declaring: 'There is no room for romance in a career.' I believe I have been misunderstood, Professor Simon. I meant there was no place for romance in my career. This is the calendar for next year. Send it to typography. And tell the Graduation Committee that I'll be happy to have them at 4:00. - Very good. - Thanks. MS. Middlecott, the article is good, but I don't think it captured its true essence. My true essence is imponderable. MS. Middlecott, despite your theories, I... Well I always hoped that perhaps our relationship could be different from that of professor and dean. Well, you saw what Time said. There is no room for romance. And time is passing. - Good morning, Miss. Middlecott. - Good morning teacher. Yes, this is Susan Middlecott. Cold, distant, connected, living in a world of her creation. Never imagined that this transatlantic plane would take someone capable of sinking the serene dignity of their peaceful existence. Someone equally cold, distant and connected. Sorry to bother you, Prof. Stevenson, but we're here. Oh thank you very much. Hey guys, Lucille Ball! Hey Lucille! - Hi, boys! How about working abroad? How about some pictures? Sure, thank you! Ready, boys. This is our best side. Get it right. Hey, ruined the photo! Can you get out of there, please? - We have to get another one. - All right. - How about saying cheese, Ms. ball? - If you insist... - Forgive me... - All right. Can you hold my coat? Of course! - And the hat stand. - Yea. You remember the teacher. Good morning teacher! Thank you teacher. - How about, boys? - Great! Excuse me. You are here to photograph an astronomer. Isn't astronomy the study of celestial bodies? �. You study your heavenly bodies, I study mine. Sends! - One more! - One more for me too! All right, send. - Thank you, Miss. Ball. Until next time. - Bye, Joe. - Thank you, Miss. Ball. - You're welcome. Thank you teacher. You made the trip very pleasant. Your article is so interesting. For some reason I feel like I'm dedicating myself to the wrong stars. I hope you can make the jump to California this time. - You'll love it. - I know, they talk so much. But is it true that in California everyone uses a blanket to sleep at night? Now, professor, how could everyone fit under one blanket? See you later. Prof. Stevenson, I'm Teddy Evans from the Pomeroy Lecture Office. - Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you. Can we take a picture of you? - My picture? - Yes, for the newspapers. The country is in an uproar with his arrival. I can't imagine why. But if you insist, of course. - Take it off, boys. - Just a moment... Is it ok or should I say cheese? How engraved ... Tirem. Pomeroy Lecture Desk Tonight in Boston. Free weekend. Then New Haven, Providence and... Don't mind me, professor. Mas Boston, New Haven Providence... Don't forget that I am a foreigner in America. - Leave it alone, we'll find it. - No? Miss Evans will accompany you to handle the publicity. But my lectures have already been contracted. Advertising for what? Professor, astronomy is a rather boring subject. Even if you are the speaker. We need to do something to... - give an emphasis. - Highlight? Like they do at the movies. The only idea that comes to my mind is his history in the War. - History in the War? - The thing in charge I read. You are quite a guy. - Do you have a lot of scars? - Please, Mr. Pomeroy... Don't be shy. No need to show. I wouldn't mind showing you... I just don't want you to use it for advertising. I refuse to capitalize on my war history and I forbid any mention of it. I have some clippings from my last lectures in England. Maybe they'll find something. But they will hardly serve to give any emphasis. I need something for the Boston papers. If I have anything, I'll send it over the phone. Don't mind me, professor. A prop�sito... before taking the train to Boston, Do you think there would be time to stop by the Cout jewelry store? Are you going for a walk? I have an errand. I won't be long. Give it time. We will only leave after lunch. - Do you want to go now? - Would it be too inconvenient? - No way. - Thanks! No, I remember that medallion well. It was purchased for Ms. Middlecott by his father. Has been some time. I have your address for sure. Aqui est�. Susan M. Middlecott. Seu endere�o � Benton, Connecticut. It is a university town a few hours from Boston. - A college for women. - Near Boston. Could I take the train to Benton this afternoon and meet you in Boston for the talk. That's not. You are my little baby and I won't lose sight of you. But that's personal. I would like to go alone. At a college for women? Sure. Oh, thank you very much. There's nothing here. If we don't get something, the lectures will be a failure. In an hour I leave for Boston and nothing for the papers. I should have gone to lunch with him. Maybe he would open up to you. We have lunch. And what a lunch! He a hot cheese with milk, I coffee and bitten nails. Wait for Susan M. Middlecott. Susan M. Middlecott. Susan M. Middlecott. Susan M. Middlecott! Chefe, j� sei! He knows? A gold medallion given to her by her father and then given to... Boss, I hit the lottery. What are you going to do? - I'll make this a novel... - Romance! Who would be interested in a romance between an astronomer and a dean? But this is a very special woman. And it so happens that Prof. Stevenson is the skeleton in your closet. It's just a shake of the bones... Al, Walter! Good that I found you. I'll give you an exclusive, something to get your fill of. With one condition. It has to come out in the afternoon edition. - Lemon, Dad? - Yes, and three sugar cubes. Are the cubes for the little ones? Six. Mom, what is 'earnings'? What, honey? A 'revenue'. Let me see, Louisa. Where is 'earnings'? � rendezvous! Susan, what wonderful news! Prof. Alex Stevenson, renowned English astronomer, made no secret that his heart belongs to Susan Middlecott, famous dean of Benton College, arriving today from England. The dean, who declared that there was no room for romance in her career, - could not be found to comment. - Give me that! Congratulations, my dear. And I must add, finally! Sorry to disappoint you, but this article is unfounded. - I've never seen that man in my life. - Well, well, Susan. Even if you didn't tell me before, I'm glad you finally realized that no woman is complete without a home, a man, children. I have a home, I have Louisa, what else do I need? - I mean your children, not adopted. - Dad... Why, I love Louisa as much as you do. You know that. Obviously this man is going to give a stupid lecture in Boston and wants to use my name for publicity. A stranger wouldn't do that. What are you going to do? Connect me with the train station. He won't be the only one speaking in Boston today. Al, this is Dean Middlecott. What is the next train to Boston? Oh no! Yes, it's important... Could it be? It is very kind of you. I'll put an end to it before it goes any further. I don't understand why you want to see this man in person. Unless... - Unless it's... - No, Dad. No it is. And stop playing cupid. Your figure helps, your aim doesn't. This girl complains too much. - Grandma. - Yes darling? What does 'income' mean? It means your mother is going to meet a man. - Doesn't she want a 'rendivos'? - I don't know, honey. You women are hard to understand. Will he be my new daddy? Well, it looks promising. Young, handsome, English. All the girls I know have parents. I dream of having one. We can dream together. I'm sorry, she's not. - Do you know where I can find her? - Today will be impossible. I really wanted to see her. I have one of her belongings that I would like to return. hmm? Who is speaking, please? Prof. Alex Stevenson. Can you say I called? Thanks. Professor Stevenson? Al�! Al�... Could you please have a sheet of paper? Thanks. Can I borrow your pen? Thanks. My dear Miss. Middlecott, Would you have an envelope? - Any special sizes? - No, anyone will do. That way you don't have to go back. It is very kind of you, thank you. - Oh, excuse me... - I know. I want it delivered to you. no. Have a seal? - Why don't you travel by bus? - Nibus? There's a stamp machine right there. - Stamping machine? - Yea. A coin is put in and a stamp comes out. Ah thank you. Perd�o! - Good afternoon, Miss... - I can't thank you. It is not for anyone that we stopped the special. It disturbs the schedules. Sorry, but it's an emergency. Everything is fine. I'll get an emergency ticket. Here it is. Sorry, but our biggest customer asked for my pen. - Do you have one? - I think so. Sorry to bother again, but... Thanks. Got change for 25 cents? - Anyway, a cash payment. - You must hate me... Not yet. Just give me some time. - I don't have change. - No? Excuse me, would you have change for 25 cents? - Hm... I only have two out of ten. - All right. It suits. Thanks. - But there's 5 cents left. - Leave it to me. You owe me. Has an honest face. I know what you're thinking. - Excuse me. - Oh no! - Is this train going to Boston? - Yea. I want to buy a ticket to Boston. - Please? - Don't feel obligated. I know. But since you've been so kind, I think I should buy you something. The company thanks you. Can I help you? Can you put it for me please? Thanks. - Good afternoon. - The suitcase, please. Ticket, please. - Fifteen, it's up front. - Thanks. - A place, sir? - Please. - Can I get a newspaper? - at will. - Thanks. - Please sit down. mind? The car is half full. Well, that being the case, I believe... It seems to me that this table alone is full. It's that everything is reserved. I hate dining alone on trains, don't you? This always happens when you owe money. We try to ignore it. They should be kinder to their creditors. You've owed me 5 cents for a long time. It would be a shame to make this a collection agency. Lettuce salad with tomato, roquefort sauce... Steak New York, asparagus, cheese and crackers, coffee... How would you like your steak, sir? Steak? I didn't order a steak. I asked. Underdone. - Tea with toast? - Yea. - Do you only want tea with toast? - Yea. 'Astronomer and Dean Middlecott. British scientist travels 200 km for love.' Oh... Some problem? No, it was nothing. - Oh I'm sorry. - Thanks. I see we have the same taste in literature. I wouldn't call it literature. Also, it's in poor taste. What an idea for this man! Exploit a renowned woman to promote yourself. It can only be to attract publicity for your boring lectures. - Boring? - No doubt. They want to create a romantic image of this man which must be as boring as your lectures. - What do you mean, boring? - You can. Or they wouldn't try to create this image of him. Just listen. The women's clubs eagerly await the arrival of the attractive and handsome young Englishman. Well, that's just... Are you saying that? I hadn't read that part. Sounds like an interesting boy, doesn't he? Must be a closeted pedant. Attractive, beautiful, young. Maybe it has nothing to do with it. Voc� � ingl�s, n�o �? - Yea. - That's why you defend him. A charlatan associating his name with that of a dean out of pure egocentrism. What must she be thinking? You must be a spinster with too many tantrums to think. What ... Now ... I bet you're a grumpy old lady who spends the nights running under the bed... dreaming. - So? - Must be coming. Platform 17. Let's go guys. If he doesn't get to this one, I'm screwed. Who knows, maybe we'll meet again without being on trains? I'm going to be in Boston for a little while, sir... - I don't know your name. - Neither do I... You are an angel! Brought to the test. Here is proof number 1. How is it going. MS. Middlecott. I'm Teddy Evans... of the Pomeroy Lecture Office. Srta. Middlecott? I am so happy that you and Prof. Stevenson have met. Take the picture, boys. - Professor Stevenson? - Sim. Oh, n�o! Please, what's the next train to Benton, Connecticut? If you run, you still catch. Platform 5. Thanks. You can stay here, Miss. Middlecott. Thank you, I'm not feeling very well. There's no problem. I'll let you know when we get to Benton. Thanks. - Yes, who is it? - It's me, Prof. Stevenson. - Go away! - But let me explain... I won't talk to you. Please go away. - Who is it? - Ticket collector. - We are coming? - Within 5 minutes. - And the headache? - To be continued. I am really sorry. - Do you have a headache? - Do you want to get out of here? MS. Middlecott, let me explain. There's nothing to explain. If he doesn't come out, I'll send him out. All right, I'll go. But first I want to give you this. - Where did you get that? - From Beno�t. He was at death. He asked me to give it to him if he came to America I also wanted you to keep your medals. I'm here. And I have some of your things that accidentally fell out of your bag. Beno�t also asked me to give him a message. Said he loved her. It was the last thing he said. Was? Car keys... I would have written it, but I don't have your address. I got it at the jewelry store. Lipstick... Lembran�as? Yes, he told me some. The small island of Paris. The table under the acacia. The table under the acacia. Slope... He was a young French officer, blond, mustache... That's right. I think I remember. Do you 'think' you remember? He missed home, he needed to talk to someone. I gave you the medallion. He had asked. He didn't have to go to the trouble. It's a medallion. I barely knew him. Did I barely know him? The man was in a concentration camp, hungry, beaten... almost to death when we saved him. But he kept his love for you alive. The only thing that survived. - And he says he barely knew him. - That's right. I barely knew him. I've never seen a colder woman in my life! My biggest mistake was bringing you that locket. I should have brought you wool panties! What a strange habit! I got a tip that you were arriving from Boston, professor. Would you like to make a statement about your novel? Yes. You can say they exaggerated beyond measure. Hmm! Worth it. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Enough for today, sir. - I think you earned it. - You're right. Nothing like exercise to whet your appetite. You are right, sir. Thanks. Anything else sir? Reunion in Boston DEAN HIT TWICE IN TWO SEASONS "I've never been attacked with a bag"... Prof. Stevenson. Anything else sir? No, that's enough. - Good morning, Maxwell. - Good Morning. - Good morning Dad. - Good Morning. What was it, something wrong? - Are you okay? - Of course I am. - He slept well? - Of course, I always sleep well. Ah... Say, how was Boston? It remains in Massachusetts. - Any news? - I haven't finished reading it yet. By the way, how was everything between you and that teacher? The pro...? Oh, all right! - Oh, �? - Yes, we solved everything once and for all. Now! And he was belligerent? - No, no... But I had to put him in his place. I don't think they're going to call our names anymore. What kind of person is he? - How do you describe it in the newspaper? - I don't know, father... I didn't pay that much attention. He seemed to be a scientist like any other. He wore glasses, a beard and... Oh! Must have shaved before this picture was taken. Our! How horrible! We have to do something. But first, I advise you to fix your hair and your history. Susan, Susan! Wait a minute, honey. Will you leave without your weapons? MS. Mathews, have the dean call me as soon as you arrive. Sim, Dr. McFall. - Good morning, Miss. Middlecott.... - Please, please! Laura, come in here. Who are these people? What do they want? Reporters want a statement. The girl says you have something that belongs to you. And Prof. Simon wants to defend his honor. Ah, n�o! The Doctor. McFall wants you to call him. Want me to make the call? I'll talk to him later. Let them in. One at a time. - I want to talk to Ms. Middlecott. - Only the photos are missing... - Wait, wait... - Where is he, Miss Middlecott? - Prof. Simon, shouldn't you be in class? - But I was so worried about you. - Why did you hit him? - I want an immediate retraction... - of that ridiculous story. - All right. What should we say? - I repeat: where is he? - I have nothing to say. I know where he is. - The newspaper says... - Is it true that you had dinner with him yesterday? - I don't even know the man. - But did you have dinner with him? - Yes, but I don't know. - Do you usually have dinner with strangers? - No. - Do you want me to leave? - Yea. - After all, yes or no? - Who is it? - is Dr. McFall. - Al�, Dr. McFall. - I repeat: what did you do with him? I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't think you either. - Not with you, Dr. McFall... - Is it true that they came back in the same cabin? - No! - But the conductor said... - I could challenge you to a duel. - Stop being a 19th century. N�o, n�o � com voc�, Dr. McFall. Tell your paper if they publish more pictures I'll call my lawyers. Now get out, get out everyone! Come on, spark. I'm sorry, Dr. McFall. I won't leave here until you tell me what you did with Prof. Stevenson. Would you excuse me for a moment, Doctor? I don't know Prof. Stevenson, I don't know where he is... I imagine you found your locket in a cookie box. What do you know about my medallion? I know you were with him, I know you gave it... I know the first thing he did when he arrived was look for you... I don't want to interfere in anyone's life, but I can't... Al? Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. McFall. Yea? Who? Prof. Stevenson? Just a moment. I also know that you're the reason he cut your lectures. - Who is now? - Prof. Stevenson on line 2. I don't want to talk to him. Well I want to! Listen, honey, my job was to take care of you. I just want to know one thing. Are you or are you not my little baby? what? For your information, this was not Prof. Stevenson. It was Dr. McFall, president of this college! Well, now I can't even get my degree. Good Morning. - Pretty color, huh? - Yes, which one? Pink past. I use devil red. Ready! If you want something, yell! I'll take care of you, dear. Let's keep these curtains closed. Can you imagine her punching that beautiful Englishman? What did you expect? Have you seen these photos? Just listen. "Dean hits twice in two seasons." English astronomer Alexander Stevenson saw new stars yesterday..." giving strength to the rumors of his romance with Dean Middlecott," who, during a fight, knocked out the man she says is a stranger. My colleague said she should worry less about classroom work and more with homework. A spinster like that had more to grab the man, not kill him. - No, Nancy? - Of course. Er ... isto � ... Of course not. Let's go fast with this. I have to go. Oh! Socorro! Socorro! Goldie! Goldie, come here! Relief! Somebody help me! What is it? - Miss. Middlecott. Srta. Middlecott! Srta. Middlecott! What happened? As a licensee, do you fear Empire Ovals? - Did you say Empire Ovals? - Yes, the cigarettes. Oh, we don't. finished. This is... - We never had. - I understand. Have you tried using this as a cocktail shaker? Good Morning. Prof. Stevenson is staying here? - Yes ma'am. - Is he? - The phone is right there. - Thanks. Prof. Stevenson, please. - Prof. Stevenson left a few minutes ago. - It went out? You can try the Middlecott house. They just sent you a car. How do you know? Excuse me, ma'am. Hm, grandma, what big ears the operator has! Take some stars, Algol for example. Its periodic brightness change is... I know. In a period of 2 days and 21 hours... Algol passes to a magnitude greater than 1... and an impressive change in brightness. - I didn't expect that, huh? - No. We have something in common. I am an amateur astronomer. I have great interest. But right now I'm more interested in you and Susan. But I've already told you everything I have to tell. It's a shame that two people like you, who have everything to understand each other, know each other but don't understand each other. No thanks. It is that your daughter is not very 'understandable'. - I'd say it's an ice cube. - But that shouldn't stop him. You know what the Greek philosophers say about ice cubes. Today's ice can be tomorrow's hot water. Dad! What a morning today! You! What are you doing here? - I invited him. - Did you invite him? It seems you didn't realize that this man made me ashamed. - If the papers find out you were here... - He told me the whole story, Susan. He is not responsible for the photos in the newspapers. Oh no? So was it me? Well, whoever chose the pose was you. Dad, don't you realize it was all planned? This man carries an advertising agent in tow. Hire people to set up these situations. And your presence here is definitely not welcome. - I just called him for a liquor. - I will leave after taking it. It is a pleasure for me to have an astronomer as a guest. - Thought I'd invite you to lunch. - Have lunch? - Only tea with toast. - We're not having lunch today. Mother! Glad you came home for lunch! 'Give back'? - You told me all about you. - Said? Yes. He said he was young, handsome and English. Don't say! Yea! Said he was going to be my new daddy. He said? Come play, dear. Alice is waiting. Come on, Louisa, come on... Well, that's the end. All morning I was harassed by reporters. By advertising agents, college presidents, by French teachers wanting to defend my honor! Now my daughter calls a perfect stranger Daddy! Father, I insist that Prof. Stevenson get out of this house. So, I leave. Alice! I decided to go to the country house with Louisa. - Pack her things, please. - Yes, Miss. Middlecott. - Stay here and play, Louisa. - Yes ma'am. I think I better go. I'm sorry your daughter is so upset... but the truth is that this publicity is bad for me too. - I'll go with you. - great. We will have lunch at the inn. Yes. Oh, I had a better idea. If you don't have plans for the weekend... - ...I have a small observatory. - Don't say! - Of course, being a professional... - No, I'd love to meet you. Would? great! Stay in our house in the mountains. What beautiful flowers. Did you plant it? no. They were born alone out there. Well, if you're going to play hostess, you'd better sit at the head. Here ... pronto. I love camping here. I wouldn't say it's ok to camp. Shall we prepare specialties today? Where did you hear that? Alice and the cook always talk about specials. I wanted you to. I can try. Susan! Wow, what a coincidence. - Is it? - We came to get away from you. - I saw the lights on outside and... - Dad, you're not staying! Mom, I can have two extra plates. - No... - I love guests. - We can't go back. I gave up the car. - You can use mine. - Well, you know I don't drive. - Professor, could you... - I don't drive either. - There's not enough food for everyone. - Not even tea and toast? - Is it just what you eat? - Underdone. I didn't understand. A 'jack'... - Ahh... - Lost. I think it's too difficult for me. Looks like that's enough for you too, Louisa. It's time for our host to go to bed. Time to sleep? This is humiliating. - We will. - Do what. That's life. Isso � francs. - Come on, grandma. You have to dress me. - Yes, that is humiliating. - Your daughter is charming. - Thanks. - I adopted her in France after the War. - You alone? Technically I couldn't, because I was single. Mas n�o resisti a Louisa. How did you get it? I wrote a letter to the Commander. I asked that the legal formalities be waived in her case. - He accepted? - No, no. She accepted. I was the commander. The next day I granted the request. Ah! Admirable. And very smart of you. - Oh, excuse me. - Thank you... It's your rice pudding. Comb, lipstick, car keys.... Strange, looks like I've done this before. It was all just a ridiculous misunderstanding. Let us not touch this matter further. great. This house reminds me of mine in Scotland. Very comfortable, isolated... That's what it's for. To get away from people. No one to bother us. Mine too. So that they don't bother us. That is, my dogs and my weapons... and other things that we men tend to take on the weekends. It is a place where, even when, the person feels accompanied. You would really love to. How to escape the routine of life. What's the problem with routines? Organized people are happy. Are you happy with yours? - Sure, it's orderly... - Practically antiseptic. - She's busy, hectic... - Yes, with other people's lives. - It is safe and comfortable. - But you're too young to be comfortable. - You amuse me. - �? He looks at me through a mental telescope and sees things that don't exist. Ah, that's what there are. It is that they have never studied it satisfactorily. - The fire is getting weak... - Let me take care of it. When your father invited me to come here, I accepted without hesitation. Too fast, perhaps. I think I unconsciously hoped you were here. why? Because the fire needed to be stoked. This shouldn't have happened, professor. Well, as an astronomer, I can say that... it was written in the stars. I'm sorry teacher... but I need to say good night. I'm going to be an Amazon tomorrow. Come pick me up early in the morning. From the looks of it, it doesn't seem to be making progress. I overcame the outer defenses, but the fortress stands. But don't give up, boy. Just because there's a little snow on the roof... does not mean that there is no fire inside the house. - Aren't you going to show me your observatory? - � to j�. We will. To what do you attribute Susan's indifference to men? - Another man, perhaps? - It might be. - Simple and cutting-edge in every aspect. - That she is, for sure. Fruit of my effort. I reassembled it myself. Ah yes... nice work. Mr. Middlecott, as for your granddaughter... - It was a little cracked when it arrived. - I mean Louisa, how old is she? Louisa, she's six. - Six years old... - Hm-hmm. Has it ever occurred to you that she might not be adopted? As well? I'm talking about Susan and the French officer... to whom she gave the medallion. You know, the case of acacia. Who knows they weren't married? N�o! - Susan would have told me. - Maybe not. She as a commander and he as an officer in another army... perhaps it would have been better that no one knew. But we were always so close. Besides, she may have been bitter... a lot. When they split up, he ended up in a concentration camp. She may have thought she had been abandoned. Well... Instead of going through the humiliation when the child was born perhaps it was easier to say that he adopted her. It would explain a lot. The wall you built around it. It might even be. Maybe you're right! Why didn't she trust me? I wouldn't have told anyone. Well... Women are weird. But I know I would tell at the right time. I would like to think so. M�e! What's up, honey? - When do you come to bed? - I'm leaving. I can't sleep. I wish I was old enough not to be able to sleep. Come on, just close your eyes again. Are you thinking about the new daddy? Louise please... Why can't we adopt him like you adopted me? You always say that you could choose between several children. But you chose me. Why can't you choose him to be my new daddy? Honey, you don't adopt husbands. why? We are entitled to one year of experience. If it doesn't work out, we can return it to the agency. But we're happy, just the two of us, aren't we, honey? I think we would be even more so if we adopted a husband. I don't know, I don't... How am I? It looks like an unmade bed. I can't understand. It fits me so well. I must have a weird body. N�o est� t�o mal. In fact, it's giving an air of willful neglect. - Oh, �? - Yea. If it's for riding, better put on your boots. �... I just hope horses have a sense of humor. Thanks. Good Morning! Good Morning. I'm ready. really? for what? Do you always dress like that for breakfast? - This is a riding suit. - Don't say! I thought it was a tailcoat. Do you mean to ride? - Yes... - Alex, I was forgetting. Thanks. Unfortunately you have no way of dressing. Well can we go? Can? Oh, do you want to go with me? Of course, last night I said that being an Amazon with some friends... So I thought I'd go along, if you don't mind. It bothers me, yes. The idea is not a good one. As it is, it was already difficult to explain. But that has already been resolved! I would like you to... Arrived! We will. Nothing like a nice ride in the morning... Professor, I don't want to know any more problems... What problem? I've been riding for years. - Besides, we'll be together. - But... Margaret, remember what I said last night? - I remember. - Well, look at him. The horses arrived and came by bicycle. Girls, I want to introduce you to Prof. Stevenson. - Girls? - You are using the generic term. Prof. Stevenson is the famous English astronomer. And one of the ten best dressed men in the world. Do you still want to walk with us, professor? I don't think I'm dressed for the occasion. Nor for anyone else. But don't be for that. It will be fun for him to come with us, won't it, girls? Let's love it! Come! I think it's better not... since I was a child I've been riding a bike... - Besides, you don't have one for me, do you? - Yes I have. I insist that you come. Can choose. How is this old lady? It doesn't look very firm. How about this one, okay? I think we're ready. Amazons, mount! - Won't you ride? - It's a woman's bicycle. Try riding sideways. - Come on, professor. - You'll be left behind! Professor! Any problem, teacher? A little bit... Go away! X! Sai da.! Watch out! Hi teacher, it's been a long time. I think this thing is now mastered. Now I intend to relax and enjoy the ride. What else could happen? Now, Prof. Stevenson. A man of your reputation lying in the gutter. Looks like something happened to your bike. Do we take a shot of mercy? I think there's only one thing left to do. - Huh? - Come. You're in shape, huh? I was just about to start this alpine trail. There! What was this? I don't know... Could it be that my lung exploded? Well, how are you feeling right now? I don't think I'll ever be able to walk again. Maybe I should have put it on the handlebars. Do you think you could have climbed that hill pedaling? I wouldn't have cycled. I would have used the engine. What would you have used? Or engine. Saw? I think I'm going to kill myself. no! I had a better idea. That thing had an engine, you didn't tell me... and made me snort, snort and snort? - Come on, control yourself! Don't come any closer! - Have you ever been beaten in your life? Yes, it's more or less like that. - You pushed me! - Don't move. Do not touch these leaves! - Why not? - Hives! Don't be scared. I'll find a way. What are you doing? Est� come�ando a co�ar. I will be covered in stains. And today is the graduation party. What are you doing? A trick I learned in the War. Make a muddy slurry and rub it into the skin. - Immediate effect on affected areas. - Oh! Quick, let's go. With this pope, you will be cured. Professor... my hands also touched the hives. Ah yes. - I think that's enough. - No, your little face... Soon. - I'm sure that's enough, professor. - Do you think I've passed everything? Yes, my face, my hands, my legs... Those were the only parts that played when I sat down... fall with my hands... Ah, voc�s est�o a�! The teacher was... rubbing my hives. Urtic�ria? Yes, I fell in that bush over there. Now, Susan, that's not hives. It is a harmless leaf. Esp�cie parthenosisis quinquefolia. Amazonas, mountain! Well, I've always been really bad at botany. Oh, poor thing... Graduation Party. - Hi, Anita, can we dance? Go ahead, Jerome, go. We have some matters to attend to. - And you, Ada? - Oh no! - Hello! - Kindness of you to invite us. Susan insisted! - Thank you teacher. - This must be a national pastime. Our readers wanted to see what you looked like without a purse on your face. Go away, go away... Go look for Susan. She will like to see you. I take care of Miss. Evans. Very lively party for a small college, don't you think? Education is a fantastic thing. Essential in any school. - Are you graduated? - No. I improved. I mean, improvement for girls, prep for boys. Hello, Prof. Simon. Why aren't you dancing? - I would dance if... - Susan! Oh, excuse me. - Yes, Margo? - I see you still have hives. - You're wrong. I'm already cured. - Is it? I figured she didn't want to be seen with this man. And I don't want to. - It seems to be looking for you. - But you won't find me. How about, sweetie, let's dance? Gosh, I'm sorry, Dean Middlecott. But you wouldn't like to dance, would you? No thanks, I... But... let's go to the garden. Garden? Us two? Most Holy Virgin! Mrs. Dean... I'm sorry... I'm not really in the mood... Tell me about you. Did you bring an escort? No, I came alone. I can't get a woman... girl. I know how you feel. - I think so, being older... - What... Who is older? - The lady, isn't it? - I'm not, no... that is, I am no older than any other woman my age. What I mean is that... you are the dean and... must be solving youth problem all the time. �... but right now I'm dealing with a problem of mine. Let's sit here for a while. These things only happen to me. You shouldn't have any problems. He is a very handsome boy. - Boy, boy, I'm a man! - Shh! - Can't you feel my chin? - I just felt it. Feel the cheek. - Wait, huh? - No, it looks like silk... That's a beard! - Oh, �? - Everyone says it's down. - My father won't even let me shave. - Shh! It has a lot of razors and it won't even let me touch it. You're stingy with the razors, huh? What kind of razor do you plan on using? El�trica. Hm... voc�... voc� � a/c or d/c? - How about dancing? - No, I prefer not to dance right now. Don't you think we should leave this bench to the kissers? I haven't seen many... kissers. It's good to see how nowadays there is less kissing than in my student days. There's still a lot... only the staff is different. Alright... alright... no need to twist my arm. You naughty... Most Holy Virgin! Didn't I read somewhere that there was no room for romance in your career? Don't be ridiculous. I just wanted to hide from you. You managed to embarrass me in front of my colleagues, now he insists on doing the same in front of my students. - Why did you come here today? - You invited me. Your father said... Oh my father... Also, as it is my last night I... - I wanted to say goodbye. - Great, I said. Please! Not like that. Since I'm here, is it a dance? - I never dance at these parties. - Is it a dance? - Will you leave as soon as it's over? - I give you my word. Hi, nice to see you again. Amazonas, mountain! I don't know why Alec kept you so secretive. You know how possessive men are. - Hello! - Ah, you found her! It allows? Sorry, this is my last performance. There would be no better time. Proof that it is the most popular party. - Hey, give me that picture! - No! This one will get me a bonus. Pass this to here! How dare you? How did you get in here? - How do you get that off? - No! It will burn the film! - Susan! Are you okay? - All right, Dad. You can return his machine. Let me through... let me through. Susan, what is it? I want this man out immediately! - Guys, follow along... - Let me take care of him. - Susan, what is this? - I'm sorry, Dr. McFall. It was a regrettable incident and I owe you an apology. I owe you all an apology. there is so much publicity, so many distorted statements I couldn't allow it to go on like this. The articles you read in the newspapers about... the Prof. Stevenson and I are imprecise in every way. I want you to know... that my heart belongs only to Benton College. I want you to know too that I am very proud of this group that is now graduating. And I want you to be proud of me. Forgive me for interrupting your party. Back to dancing, okay? Dad, keep dancing, please. I'm sorry, Dr. McFall... - Give me my stole, please. - Well, no. I'm so sorry. I think I messed it up again. If I hadn't come I wouldn't have gone through this. I know. Do not repeat yourself. Tomorrow I will leave and disappear from your life. I don't want to spoil your night. Please don't go away. - I think it's better... - Can I take her? - I'd rather not. I'm driving... - I insist. Oh, daddy has the keys, could you get them for me? - With pleasure. - Thanks. - Can I help you? - Oh! What a scare! I think I lost my car keys. Imagine s�. Do you feel anything? Oh sorry. - I just feel grass... - Never mind. Oops, I'm sorry. - Do you mind? - Oh sorry. - Do you have a car? - Yea. - Where are you? - There. - Can you take me home? - But... Miss. Middlecott... I... - We'd better not take this further. - I promise to behave. I lost my head at that time. The moon, music... It was a moment of madness. Where is your car? - On here. - Oh... - What a nice car! Yes, ma'am, a jewel. - Where are you going? - For my car. I mean this... Ah... To the! - Oh, is that your car? - Yes, my first car! Ah... - What's that horrible smell? - It's my tail. Your what? My raccoon tail. Ah... I shouldn't have cut it. I forgot to say. The door is removable. - There! - Gosh, sorry. - I should have warned you. It doesn't have... - It doesn't have a floor. Want music? It has radio. Or television or nothing. Go home, Jerome! - Snore like a kitten, huh? - Wild cat! - How far are you running? - That's a turtle step. - Not bad, huh? - It looks like the Coney Island ghost train. You should give this back to Daniel Boone. Nice brakes, huh? - Other? Impossible! - Other? Want to compare this recycled can with my atomic cockroach? Atomic? If you go over 10 km/h it will come apart. Oh, �? Want to bet? Sure. I'll wait for you over there. Ah, �? No, Jerome! Let me out of here! Don't run! It's all my fault. Your car is better than his. Everything is fine. Let me out of this car! - As soon as we pass the guy. - I would go faster alone. - What did you do? My Tail! - Grow another. - Let me out immediately! - I'll get him! Stop it, Dean. - What is it now? - My scarf! Stop this car immediately! Gosh, dean, you're almost catching up with him. Gosh, dean, it's getting in the way of aerodynamics. Xi, pulls. Thank God! Death penalty is little. Sorry to interrupt the tour, but young people should know that... Oh, your guard... he was taking me home... It doesn't matter. Documents. Don't be too harsh with the boy. It was just taking me home. I'm Dean Middlecott from Benton College. Oh, �? I am Little Red Riding Hood from Public School 22. Imagine a dean riding a 'hot rod'. It's his, not mine. This is... Not here. I must have left it in another coat. - Ah... - Have you been drinking? - Some punch. - Baptized, huh? And you, princess? I'll dispense with the sarcasm, guard. I'm trying to tell you that I'm Dean Middlecott. - What's up, Charlie? - Oh, he knows me, he can identify me. I was trying to say that I'm the Dean... - Wait a minute! Don't go ahead. Let me ask. What is hers? She says she's the dean of the college. Do you know her? She freaked out. I've never seen her fatter. Now, voc� ... But it will make a nice story. Young man with unidentified woman in a hot rod race. Thanks, Charlie. And watch out for her. It looks pretty dangerous. You better follow me. I can't go with him. I have to get that photo. - Open your mouth. - H? Date, date! Your guard! I don't think it will be possible to follow him. Looks like we lost the ignition key. If you go to the nearest post and call the college... they will send someone immediately to identify me. - All right, out. - How? Both out, please. You must be thinking I was born yesterday. Says he lost his key, well... maybe I can help you find her? I'm good at it. You mean you lost the key, huh? These keys are for my car. That's why I'm in this car. - I wonder if you don't get in that head du... - It's better that you don't enter... otherwise I will be very annoyed. Of course you don't get in, it's from my car. How could... It would be impossible... Oh! Oh, n�o! - P�e... - Most Holy Virgin! Oh, Jerome! I'm fine, dad. Just send the car, please. To the police station. No, no! They just caught me with a boy on a hot rod. It's a kind of car! I said I'm fine. Keep the car. I'm sorry, Miss. Middlecott. Allow us to take you in a police car. It won't be necessary, thank you. I wouldn't worry about the key. You are young. Digest anything. We got it. The engine just died. I'm surprised he was still alive. - Hey! - Hello! - Who are you? - And you, who are you? I'm Louisa. Did you come to see my mother? Who is your mother? - Miss. Middlecott. Srta. Middlecott? I also have a new daddy. He has just arrived from England. Your new daddy? I only met him when she brought him back from Boston. What a stick! Bye, Louisa. I discovered a new angle. Just listen! Miss Middlecott has a daughter. got it? 'Miss' Middlecott. And the daughter just said that Alex Stevenson is her father. Teddy, you drank! Not yet. But this scoop will be celebrated with vintage wine. Al�, Merle, aqui � a Pearl. I'll let you hear something. If that doesn't scare you, you have cockroach blood. Al�, Earl, aqui � a Pearl. Stick that ear to the phone. I want you to hear something. If you're wearing a hat, it's better to take it off. This will make you fly. Of course, the news is a bomb. But you cannot publish that a single woman of Dean Middlecott's stature has a daughter. It doesn't matter who the father is. is slander. �... maybe you're right, boss. But it would have snapped. Well, I have to find another angle. - Let me know. - Said. Al�, Merle, � a Pearl. You must have hair standing on end. Goose pimples? Gave me a perm! Earl, � a Pearl. Que tal? To make your mouth water. - Have you heard the last one? - No. Well, they say... N�o! A Srta. Middlecott? Believe me, it's not like me to spread gossip about Ms. Middlecott and his daughter. But the whole town already knows. You can't hide something like that. Certainly. The students don't talk about anything else. The whole campus. � horr�vel, n�o? Quite frankly. I've never been so turned on in my life. It's more exciting than biology class. If my parents find out, they'll get me out of Benton right away. - Why? - Liberalism has limits, right? This one I took yesterday. The dean, the boy and the 'hot rod'. When I got the tip, I sent myself over to the Middlecotts' and took it from the girl. What matter! I already have the call. 'A Child of Prominence. Question Mark.' got it? I've never heard anything more absurd. It's fantastic! I don't want to be humiliated anymore. But, Susan, right now, graduation week. Students, parents, faculty, everyone talking... What right do they have to speak? It's not just about you, you have a good reputation It doesn't involve just you. It has the good reputation of Benton. It cannot suffer from scandals, however baseless they may be. Well, the Council rules. I will clarify everything once and for all. It's the best thing you can do, Susan. I can go? I don't want to miss anything. It feels good to be there. After all, it's about your daughter's reputation. Your daughter's reputation is beyond suspicion. I'll be in my office in 15 minutes. Thanks. - Susan. - Come in, Dad. Susan, I need to talk to you. This is no time for conversation. No, but I want you to know that I understand everything. All what? I know that Alex Stevenson is not Louisa's father. - But I also know that she is not adopted. - The adoption papers are in this box. - I know that Beno�t... - What does Beno�t have to do with that? - Alec and I were arguing... - Ah, Alec! - Susan, you don't have to keep pretending... - Here they are, Dad. You're right... Well, I can only say that I am very, very disappointed. - Why? - Maybe I wanted to believe... in that story with Beno�t. Susan, don't you see that this could be a good opportunity for you? Opportunity to be mocked by the whole community? To defend myself against baseless lies before the Council? Not that. It is the opportunity to become a woman. - I'm a woman! - No. You look like a woman. But the similarity stops there. You talk like an encyclopedia. Think like a dictionary. It has the emotion of... Why don't you send that Council to...? No, of course you can't do that... But I could... No, I don't think so either. But, Susan, this is the time to run after the man you love. - Man I love? - Will you deny it? Of course I do. He doesn't mean anything to me. - Who? - Prof. Stevenson! - Who spoke of him? - Said I was in love with him. - I don't. You said that... - Me? - Susan, do you want to end up a spinster? - You know my theory about it. And you know my theory about yours. I'm tired of doctrines, theses, inflexible schedules, self-denial... and cold women like daughters. It only has one life! Why live it in an emotional straitjacket? - You brought me up like that! - I didn't educate, no. I gave him every advantage possible. The best schools, summer in Europe. Because I like spoiled women. They are more feminine. And because I thought with... an education, clothes, good looks and my money... you would bring home a man. But brought? No, he brought diplomas, titles, uniforms. Instead of bringing a man, I brought decorations. I'm sorry to let you down, Dad. I thought you'd be proud of it. Susan, why don't you listen to your heart? And not your head. It's getting late. We will. Come in, bellboy. I'm almost ready. You can take my bags in a moment. Ah... You must have entered the wrong room. - Voc� � o Prof. Stevenson, no? - Yes, on Prof. Stevenson. So this is the right room. Can I adjudge? I'm Paul Simon from the Faculty's French Department. How are you? I came to talk about a very delicate matter. - A Srta. Middlecott. - Susan Middlecott? She has nothing delicate. No, but the situation you find yourself in is. There is a rumor that monsieur is the father of her daughter. - And it's perfectly possible... - That I'm what? Your daughter's father. But this is absurd! Who invented such a story? That, monsieur, is what you ought to know. But I don't know! Besides, I'm not the girl's father. - But it could be, right? - It's kind of late. This is... Ms. Middlecott means a lot to me. She has unfortunately been like a sister to me. D� to understand. Not a sister I would like to see in this situation. The Council will meet. They can ask for your resignation. Hm... sorry to hear. I know what the career means to her. But I can't do anything. - Tem, sim, sir. - Hmm? I could say they are married, there would be no more scandal involving the child. I can't do this! I can't go around claiming to be the father of someone else's child. That's not done, friend. Oh, sir... It's just a white lie... then he would go his way and everyone would be happy. No, I'm sorry. Susan Middlecott knows how to take care of herself very well. Take my advice, go back to your classes. She will know how to handle the situation. You English people are so gallant. Susan, I want facts. A statement is needed putting an end to this rumor. For the college's sake. And the statement must be supported by facts. Well, that's precisely what I'm going to give you. I have here... Please forgive me for interrupting... I know the reason for this meeting, but if you give me a moment... I'm sure I can clarify everything. - Susan? - I can clarify the situation myself. Yes, but as I am the cause of the misunderstanding... I feel obliged to clarify it. Maybe speed up the procedure. - It's a little late for explanations by Prof. Stevenson. Not if you let me tell the whole story. - All history? - What whole story? Well, we have nothing to hide, do we? - Of course not! - Ento! For that, I need to send them to France during the war. - Need to start there? - That's where I entered the scene, wasn't it? Sadly yes. It's the old story, wounded officer... a pretty american girl... hot summer afternoons, moonlight... sipping cognacs under ace... I barely knew this man. - Our! - How is it, Susan? That is, he was injured and I took care of his convalescence. And having fun baby, a romance was born. One night he asked you something and... she gave. - My medallion! - With the current. The romance evolved into passion and they were soon married. - How... - She literally dragged him... to the chapel in Normandy. How can you say such a thing? - I was very weak... - You? We got married and spent the wedding night under the same near the little chapel in Brittany. Brittany? Said he got married in Normandy! No, what I meant was... - ...that Louisa was born in Normandy. – Louisa was born in St. Tropez! Honey, you don't remember. She was sick and confused... I wasn't even there! Dad, this man is crazy! If this is a joke, you've chosen a bad time for jokes. Yes, I believe so. Well. I'm sorry. Good Morning. Susan, can't you see what he's trying to do? Now that it has become clear that Prof. Stevenson is not the child's father... maybe you can tell us who it is. Pardon. I need to talk! I need to talk! Tongues are knocking and they only make a lie beat! Gentlemen, why did Ms. Middlecott brought me to this country? Why did you want to learn French? no! Why do I have a lot of money? no! Because I'm young and handsome? no! You brought me because I'm your husband. I am the child's father. - I never imagined... - Neither did I. Thank you for your intent, but you are 30 seconds late. Prof. Stevenson has already claimed that honor. No diga! That's wonderful! If he's the father, it couldn't have been me. No, you can't. - That solves everything. - Not for me. As president of this faculty, I demand that you explain yourselves. Both are being gentlemen. Neither of them is my husband or Louisa's father! This is no time for chivalry. I want facts. I have no alternative. I'll have to ask for your resignation... unless you prove this rumor to be false and unfounded. I thought you had absolute confidence in me. Evidently all my years of dedication are being questioned because of a rumor, rumors without any foundation. Facts, facts... Here are your facts. N�o... N�o. I'm sick of doctrines, theses, inflexible schedules and... - E... - Abnega��o. E abnega��o. You don't have to ask for my resignation. I ask. - I never imagined you would do that! - Me neither. Well, I figured this meeting would have another outcome. And for the sake of the child, just for the record... we have the legal documents of the adoption! Sim. Take a look. I'll see that everything is in order. Alec! Glad I still caught you. You won't take the train and disappear. You won't take any trains. Unless I come with you. It's the first sensible thing I hear you say. It's time to realize that you need a man in your life. You two need it. - Two? - Yes, you and Louisa. So much confusion about the paternity of the child. I always knew she was yours. Do you really think Louisa is my daughter? Sure! I am sure. Oh dear, what a surprise you're in for. If you can read French, here are Louisa's adoption documents. Grab Alec while you can. Today's hot water can be tomorrow's ice cube. It's a real surprise. I really enjoyed these documents, dear. Legends: Luís Filipe Bernardes
