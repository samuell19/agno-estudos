There are thousands of our boys in field hospitals all over North Africa and Italy who owe their lives to Dr. Blalock's work in the treatment of shock. I want everyone here to know how grateful we are to him, and how proud you all should be. Hear hear! Hear hear! Dr. Blalock, welcome welcome. Thanks, General. Thanks, General. It's great to have you here, Al, but truth be told it's Mary we really want. Our new chairman of the Department of Surgery, my old and dear friend, Dr. Alfred Blalock. Thank you, Walter. Mary and I welcome you all to our home. As do our dear children. Sadie get them to bed now. Thank you, Johns Hopkins, for my prodigal return after 15 years in the Tennessee backwoods... to find myself back here. Dreams do come true. You're the best surgeons in the country and I'm honored to lead you. To use a timely reference... "We'll storm the beaches together shoulder to shoulder. Lay siege to the mysteries of medicine." We'll make the kind of progress Hopkins used to be known for. I know we will accomplish great things together. Blalock: I'm looking for my next watershed discovery. Not to put too modest a point on it. It's not enough for us to be great surgeons. We need to be outstanding researchers. Any ideas? Anything innovative? Man: What about skin grafts?

Go on, Dr. Taussig, tell us more. Well, it's something that up to now has been written off as untreatable. But I don't believe it has to be. I'm speaking of Tetralogy of Fallot. Blue babies. Yes, these children, their hearts aren't failing. They're suffocating, due to a blockage in the main artery to the lung. Pulmonary stenosis. Taussig: The mortality rate is 100%. I've watched hundreds of cyanotic children die. I admitted a baby tonight who will certainly die simply because no one has had the courage to attempt a surgical solution to this. Well, maybe with good reason. To put it mildly. Helen, you can't operate on the heart. That's basic. We don't have clinical proof of that... That is my point exactly. I think it's possible for us to be able to... Come on, Denton, you have to stop the heart to perform a complicated correction in less than three minutes, and by that time they're dead. These children are doomed. There must be a way to get more blood to the lungs. I doubt we could repair the defect in the heart walls... Without causing ventricular fibrillation. No, but maybe there's a way to avoid interfering with the greater circulation. If we focus on the pulmonary artery. Blalock: Mm-hmm.

Sorry. Here is the Saxon baby I was telling you about last night. Thank you. Mm-hmm. She usually smiles when someone does that. Hello, Mrs. Saxon. What is that thing? It's an oximeter. It reads how much oxygen there is in the blood. She looks cold in there, but I can't hold her. They say it isn't good for her. I'm not even supposed to let her cry. How do you keep a baby from crying especially if you can't hold her? You can see the change in the shape of the size of the vessels as these hearts grow larger. I did necroscopies on some of my patients' hearts in order to study the malformations in detail. It's amazing they could live at all with hearts like these. Mr. Gross at Harvard said only God could correct a narrowing indentation of the left side of the aortic arch. Perhaps that statement says more about Harvard than it does about God. That baby back there... how long? Six months. A year at the very most. That's not right. Are you going to take this on, Doctor? Helen, I want to see all your diagnostic notes. I'll get them right away. Thank you. Blalock: Put away the books, Vivien. Let's not waste any more time on theoretical crap. Let's start with experiments. Four separate defects of the heart working in combination. The pulmonary artery is constricted... in the main artery before the divide, diminishing blood supply to both lungs. And the hole in the septum causes the used blood to flow back into the arterial system, instead of flowing through the lungs, turning the babies blue. A baby's heart's delicate. It's a goddamn minefield. The first step is to see if we can create the blue baby condition in a dog, and then come up with a plan to solve it. You're drinking too much coffee.

Oh, indeed it would. But I hope you'll forgive my skepticism. There's no reason for us to think it's possible. And every indicator says it can't be done. Most of us agree, Al, the risks are huge. There isn't even any incremental progress. Where you see risks, I see opportunity. Hey, you gotta take care of that sink up in 4B. And I thought you said you were gonna fix these steps?

I've got 30% desaturation. That dog was faintly blue at best. Till we get the dog in the same state as the baby, we can't move forward. What is the problem? Every time I constrict, it kills the dogs. I've tried nylon, ligature, umbilical tape, ox fascia. We need a new approach. Okay, forget constriction. Try a partial lobectomy. Remove both lobes of the right lung. Do an arteries to veins fistula where the medial wall of the aorta and the pulmonary artery adhere. I'll be in the OR. That's a very good idea, Doctor, thank you. Damn it! You did the best you could. With the condition of his liver, you never had a chance. I, always have a chance. Get me his autopsy. Yes sir. Shit! Damn! What's that? Our new respirator. I was rummaging around the machine shop.

You know the feel of the room in the dark. That looks impossible. Oh no no, if I can do it, you can do it. You see, uh... this string here, that's how you get traction on the suture, 'cause you need a lot of exposure for the anastomosis. Mm-hmm. I'd like to work with you some time. Oh fine, Dr. Longmire, that'd be fine. My emergency rotation starts in 10 minutes, but I can come in on Thursday. That'd be fine. You have a good day, Doctor. Harold? What are you doing here?

So tell me, tell me, what was it like? Well, nine white guys in big gowns walked in first. Then the school board lawyer. Our lawyer Thurgood Marshall, he looked kind of lonely in there. And you know what them people said in their brief? Said since colored teachers in Nashville live so cheaply, they should pay us a whole lot less than white teachers. But let me tell you... Thurgood... Thurgood said he'd be goddamned if they could get away with that. So he gets up and says to that white lawyer, "You're full of it. Have you ever read the Constitution? The damned 14th Amendment... the equal protection clause says a government can't discriminate based on race." Yes, Lord. I mean, he was good, Viv. I think we got the Board of Education on the run. That's good news, Harold. So when will they decide? Could be months, longer. I don't know, but I can wait, after all these years. All those calls I got in the middle of the night... white folk telling me they gonna kill me if I don't drop this lawsuit. No, you gotta show 'em you won't take that kind of treatment. Come here. So listen to me when I tell you, you need to leave this sorry-ass place and that dead-end job. Oh, Harold, Dr. Blalock's doing the best he can for me. Ah, it's not enough. He trusts me to carry out those experiments on my own. I'm running the whole lab. Thank you, baby. But does he compensate you extra for that? Oh now, Harold, Vivien's doing important research now. But he's forgetting what Granddaddy told us. He said he regretted acting so grateful for being free, for what really wasn't any freedom at all. Wasn't freedom at all. I know, I remember. That's right. Did you hear that? Hey. What you giving him extra for? What's wrong with me? Nothing minding your own business wouldn't cure. You got that white coat. But you're just a class three worker, same as me. In fact, I got two years seniority on you. I'm making more than you. Don't think you some kind of big shot around here. Excuse me, buddy. Class three, what does that mean? It means salary grade. And, ma'am, and this here? What's this? Job classification. What is class three? Maintenance worker. I'm a lab technician. That can't be. Vivien Thomas. Okay. Here we go. "Vivien Thomas, class three." Thank you. How's it going? The vessel's tolerating ligation. Any progress? If you kill that dog, I swear I will take it out of your paycheck. I'm finished up here. Dr. Longmire, would you mind closing up for me? Thank you. Oh, come on, Vivien. Vivien. Vivien. Vivien, I... I was kidding about taking it out of your paycheck. Well, good luck 'cause I only make $16 a week. That's for a 16-hour day. Well, that's all they can pay. That's all they can pay class three workers around here. What are you talking about? That's my job classification. Who cares what they call you, you and I both know how valuable the work is that you do. If my work is so important, then why am I class three? Two grades below what I do in classification and pay. I don't know why. I don't pay attention to bureaucratic details. I see. Look, at Hopkins you can't be a technician without a college degree. And where are you going? I need to fix some steps. We have work to do. Do I have your permission to do some work for my landlord, so I can pay my rent? Longmire: Dr. Blalock, could you come here please? You're not gonna believe this. Look at the oximeter. The gums are blue, Doctor. Vivien did it. Mary: Off, Alfred. Off, Alfred! I brought him up here. I gave him this opportunity. I don't set the pay scale. I just don't see what more I can do. You're probably feeling guilty. Guilty? What the hell do I have to feel guilty about? For not sending him to college. You think I should have sent Vivien to college? Sure, why not? Told me that was his dream. Even mentioned it to me once. You know I need him in the lab. Well... I guess there's only so much good one person can do. Congratulations on the dog. The kind of raise you're suggesting, how important is this? He makes it possible for me to be in many places at the same time. Can't you just hire a well-trained college kid... No, I can't. His hands are important to me. He's good at following my instructions, improving on them. Better than anyone I've ever encountered. So you want me to circumvent every administrative regulation on behalf of a colored helper. Walter, I'm close to accomplishing something, and I need him with me so I can continue with my research. Can I count on your help? Hello, Clara. Dr. Blalock. Come in, sir. Thank you. Is Vivien at home? Yeah, he's putting the kids down. Viv. You know... in 13 years, Dr. Blalock, I don't recall you ever stopping by our house. I don't recall ever being invited. Professor. Did something happen? Yes, I obtained a raise for you, 25 extra dollars a month on top of what you're already making. That's 300 for the whole year. Will that be sufficient? What job classification? Surgical technician. I got you promoted. Promoted... to what he already does. Excuse me. Now you can pay your rent and put all your focus on our research. Vivien, back there in the lab with Panches, what did you do? What you suggested. A partial fistula. I stitched the main arteries and veins together end to end, and two lobes of the lungs. We created a blue baby's heart in that dog. Did we? Now we have our disease model, we can find a cure. And as much as I enjoyed coming here to see you, would you mind terribly if I got you a telephone? No, not at all. Thank you. A shunt. I'm sorry, Doctor, what'd you say? We need to create a shunt to get more oxygenated blood to the lungs. Can't see how to do it. Remember back in Vanderbilt when we were doing the research on how to create high blood pressure in the lungs? Yes, I connected the subclavian to the pulmonary artery. We failed to get the higher blood pressure, but we did get higher blood flow. Which is exactly what Dr. Taussig said these babies need. That's it. We build a bypass. Take an artery and redirect it. Systemic artery to the pulmonary artery then... Through the lungs. It's a long way around, but it gets you there. If we went from the right side, we have an advantage there. But the recurrent nerve is in the way, and if we kink that... Vocal cords paralyzed. And the carotid's here. We may kill the brain if we damage that. Comforting thought. The subclavian... tie it off here. After the divide. Cut it right under the clavicle. Swing it down, along a slow general arc. Will it hold if we pull it down four inches? If your hands don't get too excited. Thank you for the vote of confidence. No one's ever done anything as hard as this. Changing the course of blood. And turn blue into pink. And death into life. I don't care what the chart says. This girl wants to live. Retractor. No, suture. Can't we try things my way occasionally? Oh, all right. Sutures. Do you mind if I show you something, Doctor? Thank you. Do you need any help? No, that's fine, thank you. I have to purse string the anastomosis. Okay, there. He's all yours, Doctor. Do you feel the connection? Are you sure you did this, Vivien? This is like something the Lord made. Look, Mr. Saxon, Mrs. Saxon, I acknowledge that these are uncharted waters. There are risks. But I think we have found a way to repair your daughter's heart. How? You're stationed where... Norfolk, is it, Mr. Saxon? Yes sir. Been working on the Spencer, trying to get her back out to sea. You work on the engines, right? Yes sir. Well, I'd be changing around some of the piping leading to and from your daughter's heart. Just... just switching around the pipes? Yes. Arteries that bring the blood to and from the heart to the lungs act just like pipes. I've been successful switching them around. It's that easy? No, it's not that easy. No surgery is, and this operation has special complications. But I still think it's worth doing. Well... we're gonna talk about this, Doctor. Good idea. It's gonna be a lot harder with a baby. We're gonna have to collapse one of her lungs. She's already so cyanotic. She's not getting enough oxygen, and we're gonna have to take away half of her lung function. You made those new clamps yet? I'm working on it. What if I shred her insides with those clamps? So many ways to fail. Every second counts. A single minute is too long. A single minute of poor blood flow to the brain, a single second of open bleeding. Mrs. Saxon: Are you saying I shouldn't allow this doctor to perform a miracle to save my baby? We don't get to demand miracles. Honey, God has his plans. Maybe we just have to accept it. But I was so happy when I was pregnant with Eilene. You know, I haven't had enough time. Why can't God let me get to know her first? I mean, I don't want to go against Him. But why can't His plan be... to let this doctor save her life? Professor Blalock. Mrs. Saxon told me you plan to operate on her baby. Have you actually seen this child, Doctor? I check on her every day. And you're still going to proceed? Have you had any success in the lab? Absolutely. I successfully performed a shunt on a dog just two weeks ago. I can't imagine you're gonna proceed based on a laboratory success on a dog. How many people have you saved? So what you're telling me is you're performing an experiment, not an operation? My instincts tell me nature made a mistake and I can fix it. Would you like to see what I've been doing, Father? And right now my instincts tell me perhaps you should come back another day. What? Your quest for glory is vain, arrogant. It takes arrogance to cut someone with a scalpel, to save their life. I have no doubt. But if you intervene with God's will, violate the purity of an innocent heart, the parents, not you, Doctor, will bear the burden of guilt. Perhaps God is, as you say, trying to kill this child. I am not. Vivien: Oh, look at this. The shunt gave out. Yeah, it looks like a train wreck. What happened to you, Panches? Maybe we should just stop here, Doctor. No. We using the wrong vessel? What the hell's going on? Babe, babe. Get up, baby. Mm-hmm. Wake up. It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's just a nightmare. Oh my God. Where the hell have you been, Vivien? I had a dream about this white woman last night. Well, perhaps that's something best kept to yourself. No... I knew it was Eilene Saxon. She was all grown up. She was sitting there in a corner. She was knitting, and she let out a baby voice and she fell over dead. I couldn't see it, but I knew that inside she had a baby heart. She just fell over dead. What the hell does that have to do wi... The stitches didn't grow. When we did the shunt on Panches, he was 10 pounds. He went up to 20. He pulled it loose. I was wrong. Purse stringing doesn't work. We need a new stitching technique. Continuous on the back wall, interrupted on the front wall. That's what we need. And then, the shunt will grow. 65% oxygenation. She's deteriorating so rapidly. How will you have time to practice the operation? We can't let up. What about the new stitching technique? We're trying it out tomorrow. Man: Hey, you have to see this. Vivien Thomas is operating assisted by the chief of surgery. Pull the inbound vein ostomosis. Long slow gentle arc. I can't see. Can you see, Vivien? Could you adjust that lamp? Are the clamps still holding? Yes. No kinking? None. All right, now for the tough part. Continuous sutures on the back wall, interrupted on the front. Removing bulldog clamp... Come on, girl. Come on, please. That's it. A little bit more. A little bit more. I can feel the flow to the lungs. Helen, tell the Saxons we'll be operating. You betcha! You'll be ready. Yes. Now that I've seen the master at work. Master of the hounds. Your daddy should be proud of you. I think he is. Mine was only proud of the fact that I could wiggle my ears. I think he'll be proud when you operate. He's dead. The dead are with us all the time, I believe. Can't separate the past from the future, any more than you can your right arm from your left arm. Ah, but you see, they are separated, by this, by the heart. Or connected. Or connected. "No... li... tangare." Do not touch. Do not touch the heart. We are gonna challenge this ancient doctrinal myth in this hospital. Who wants to attend? Dr. Swedlin? Dr. Filmore? Dr. Cooley. And Dr. Longmire. Thank you. Al, you're dangling your reputation off a cliff. Calm down, Walter, this isn't grand opera. Isn't a doctor's first tenet "do no harm"? What are you saying? Postpone the operation until you have more experience. Postponing means signing that baby's death warrant. I will not be the one to do that. But they'll ruin you. Walter, I'm operating tomorrow. Oh, Al. You're rushing this. 'Cause you don't want to admit to those parents that you spoke too soon. You should come to bed. I tried that. Can I give you a ride to the hospital tomorrow? Thanks. I could use the lift. I don't trust myself behind the wheel. Al, anybody would be nervous. It's not that. I was just thinking about a remark you made. You said I used to be wild, or just ambitious. But I wonder if my ambition hasn't driven me wild. Dr. Taussig. Professor. I just wanted to wish good luck to everyone. Taussig: Thank you, Vivien. Thanks, Vivien. We're gonna block that baby's pulmonary artery for 30 minutes. Oh. As long as her blood pressure doesn't go below 60, I think, she should be fine. I don't think she can survive much lower than that. Isn't that right, Dr. Harmel? Not below 60, that's right, Doctor. Dr. Blalock, they're ready. Doctor. Man: Coming in now. Dr. Longmire. Man: What the hell is he doing? What is going on? They won't page him. Why not? Something about hospital policy. Page Vivien Thomas immediately. Dr. Blalock, what's wrong? What's happened? It's all right. I won't tell you again. Page him. We're only allowed to page doctors. Gimme that goddamn phone! Vivien Thomas, paging Vivien Thomas. You're wanted in OR. Right now. Come on, run, do you hear? This is Blalock. Thank you. Good luck. Oh. Jesus. About time. Scrub up. Scrub up? You're coming in with me. Would you find Mr. Thomas something to stand on? What for, Doctor? You're talking me through this. Now scrub up. What's he doing? What the hell's that? I'll see about this. Should we say a prayer? Forget it. He won't listen to me. Dr. Blalock, a word. You can resume your duties. These are his duties. Can you see now? Yes, Doctor. Okay, I think we're ready to start. Okay. We're going in. It's gonna be all right. It'll be just fine. You'll be all right. Incising the mediastinal pleura from the main left pulmonary artery. To the apex of the pleural space. I'm dissecting the pulmonary artery. Well back into the mediastinal. This all right, Vivien? That looks fine. The right angle clamp. Blalock: Okay, I think it's holding. Are you able to deliver the left subclavian artery? I believe so. Blood pressure? 70, falling. Now do not move that light! And now I'm dividing the ar... ooh! Careful! Clamp it, clamp it! I can't reach it, Doctor. I got it. Hemorrhage controlled. Can you see, Doctor? Not really. Nurse. For goodness sake, can't you even see my ears? Sorry, Doctor. Blalock: The suture. Blood pressure is 68. Yes yes, go on. Watch the carotid. Yes, traction on the suture. Okay, now the clamp Vivien made. What clamp? The one just there. Right here, yes. We're about to connect the shunt. Blood pressure is 60. No, 59. I know. I'm almost there. Now front interrupted. Real good. That's good, Doctor. That's good, just little more now. Removing the bulldog clamp. I see some bleeding right... I know. I see it too. Suture. Suture! No no, Doctor, the other way. Yes yes! Good good, you got it now. Bleeding controlled. Blalock: I'm palpating the connection. What do you feel? I can't tell if blood is flowing through the shunt. It's just too small to feel anything. Dr. Blalock, you have to see this. Oh-hh my God. Blalock: My God. Her blood pressure is rising. Evacuate the blood in the chest cavity, Bill. Put in the chest tube. Doctor: Are we inflating the left lung with oxygen? Ready for closure. Who'd have thought it possible... heart surgery?! And we did it right here at Johns Hopkins! Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Walter: It'll be taught in every school and hospital around the world! We did it! We did it! I knew you could do it. I knew you could... Man: Some operation, huh? Man #2: Amazing. That child's chances were so slim. Took a hell of a surgeon to pull her through. He was lucky to have that nigger in there with him. Thomas sure saved his ass. I'd like to see him try it without him. You did well in there, Vivien. Thank you. You performed an excellent surgery, Doctor. Yes. I think I did. Please, I understand, but this is a hospital. Can you please keep your voices down? I can understand how you all must feel, but we have been overwhelmed with children from all across the country, and then there's just one doctor to perform these operations. So if you could just go to the administration office, they'll be able to accommodate all of you into Dr. Blalock's schedule, as soon as possible, all right? I'm terribly sorry. Making the first incision. Are you there, Vivien? Yes, I'm here. Thank you for the opportunity to observe, Dr. Blalock. It's an honor, Doctor. Once again, excellent work, gentlemen. Thank you, Helen. Now may I introduce my colleagues? Dr. Helen Taussig, Vivien Thomas. This is Dr. Craford from Stockholm, and Dr. Petrovsky from Leningrad. You have given surgeons around the world great courage with your deeds. Coming from such an eminent surgeon as yourself, that is a compliment indeed. It's been a great pleasure to meet you, Dr. Taussig. Oh, thank you. Dr. Thomas. Call me Mr. Thomas or Vivien. You're not a doctor? Oh no, I just work here with Dr. Blalock. Can we please have all the doctors who participated in the Blue Baby operation in this shot? There's a young woman who hitch-hiked from Appalachia with her son. And I think his blood levels may be low enough to test. Talk to Dr. Taussig about scheduling him in. If you'd all turn and face the center, please, like Dr. Longmire. Helen. Photographer: Very good. Thank you. Now focus your attention here, please. Smile, focus here. Hold that. Good. Now if we could have one of you alone, Dr. Blalock. Very good, sir. Focus here if you would. Here we go, Doctor. Look here. Thank you. Thank you very much. They're nice pictures, aren't they? They always have nice pictures. Just 'cause you're not in the news doesn't mean you weren't there, Viv. I'll... I'll be back. Man: A man who is a real pioneer. A gambler who takes all the right risks, who's rescued untold lives with his work in shock and has gone on to challenge the entire medical establishment to reconsider an age-old taboo in performing the world's first heart surgery. Now without embarrassing myself, I'd like to introduce a man who has undeniably brought a dash of pink to the cheeks of others. Dr. Alfred Blalock. Thank you. I am indeed honored. And while I'm grateful for the many gifts that have been given to me in my life... perhaps the greatest gift has been the support of my colleagues over this last year. My good friend Walter Dandy. The wonderful brilliant colleagues who assisted me in our operation, Dr. Helen Taussig, Dr. William Longmire, Dr. Denton Cooley, Dr. Mel Harmel. I believe one group of people could not have accomplished so much in so little time without a strong unified effort in the spirit of breaking new ground... together. To further the reach of medicine is one that should be cherished and never allowed to die. What the hell is this? I need to do something different. What about our work? You got all of those other people you were thanking. What are you talking about? The Belvedere Hotel. The Belvedere is segregated. You were there? Snuck in, dressed like a bellhop. Is that what this is all about, hobnobbing with the powers-that-be? Vivien, they will never let you into their club. It is naive to think otherwise... Will you stand still?! I'm not talking about them. I'm not talking about Hopkins. I'm talking about you. Me? What have I ever done except fight in your corner? I have taken you every step of the way with me and now you wanna throw all that away, for what? Is that any way to show your gratitude? I don't know. You tell me, Doctor. Vivien. Take pride in the fact you have power in your mind and in your heart. And in my hands. Exactly, in your hands. We made history together. We changed the world. The world... I'm invisible to the world. I don't mind that. I understand that. I thought it was different in here. Man: Mr. Thomas, I'm a little confused. Now you want college credit from Morgan State, without actually taking classes? In certain courses. Yes, I'll take the test. I'll take finals. Chemistry, biochemistry, science, physics. So I can get the credit for material I already know. I need to get through college a little more quickly, so I can get on to med school. And so you actually participated in all this groundbreaking research, Mr. Thomas? Yes yes, I did. Yeah, well... I'm afraid it just doesn't work like that. You'll have to start with freshman English, a social science, maybe... I don't have time for that. I'm 35 years old. You're saying that I'd have to start at the beginning? Well, yes, Mr. Thomas. I'm afraid that is in fact what I'm saying. I thought this institution provided opportunity for colored people? I have a wife, two young daughters, son. And I've been working in my field for over... almost 15 years now. I'm from Nashville. I came... Man: And what can I do for you? My name is Vivien Thomas. I work for the Ralph Wintham Company. We have a line of pharmaceuticals, particularly antacids. We already have a supplier of antacids. Yes, well, these antacids block against gastroesophageal reflux without any added side effect. Vivien Thomas. The fellow with the blue babies? A patient of mine works at the hospital, told me about you. Hopkins is doing well because of what you did for them, and here you are. Well... I don't have anything against the hospital. I'm just working in medicine in a different way now. Let's see what other lines you have. Well, yes, we have effervescent powder here. Oh! Will you look who's here?! Hello, hello! Clara: Come on, baby, say hi to grandma. Oh, my bab... oh, my goodness! How you doing? How you doing, sweetheart? Look at him. Look at him. Stop all that running. Go upstairs and wash your hands, and bring your little sister back down with you. And be careful on them steps. Well, what about construction? Father: I keep asking him... Thomas & Thomas. With the building boom, we could clean up. Now he know I can't saw a plank worth a damn. That's the truth. Yeah, Dad, I did see that mailbox leans to the side a little bit. I still don't understand why you quit teaching in the first place. I never really liked the classroom that much, Clara. Too many kids. But you fought all those years, and you won the case, so... Exactly. And quitting now means you've just wasted a whole lot of time. No no, I... Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. If Harold wasn't down there doing what he was doing, there would still be a lot of colored teachers down there getting cheated. I think they ought to name the school after him. Yeah, Harold Thomas High. Mm-hmm. Harold Thomas High. Hear hear. Naw. Most of these young teachers, they don't know anything about that strike. They just take their equal paycheck for granted. Harold, you're full of excuses. There's ain't no point in you waiting for the world to thank you, Harold. That bus ain't never gonna come. Mother: Amen to that. Harold: I'm not waiting, Pop. I'm just looking for something that excites me as much as hammering nails pleases you. Hey, Viv, "Jeopardy" is on. I'll be in in a minute. You okay? I'm fine. Stomach's bothering me a little bit, but I'm fine. Why don't you take one of them fancy antacid pills you always brag about? It's your brother? I miss him. I miss the old Harold. He seems a little lost now. I miss you. Still got my mind in that lab. It's not just your mind, Viv. It's your heart too. I don't know what I'm supposed to do, Clara. I think I've embarrassed myself enough. I can't go back in there with my tail between my legs. It's where you belong, Vivien Thomas. So how you walk back on in there, well... that's up to you. Dr. Blalock: Yes. Vivien. Doctor. Good morning. How was your trip to Europe? Well, it was very gratifying. The entire world seems to have stood on its feet for this moment in time. What can I do for you, Vivien? I've made a mistake, and I would like my old position back. Well, and how's it gonna be any different? I'm still the same self-righteous bastard. It's not about you. It's about the work.

Thank you. This is... There was a message for you, Mr. Thomas. Dr. Blalock wanted to see you. I'm sorry. Would you tell him I'll see him... He's about to leave for the day. Honey, I have to call you back. Okay. How's your girls? Oh, they're fine. They're doing well. Theo's in Morgan State now. Oh, that must feel good. Yes. Yes. How are things with you? Well, you know, I've had the unfortunate experience of being put in the hands of surgeons. Hmm. You have something on your mind, Doctor? Yes, Columbia's been dangling an offer to teach. But I wanted to talk to you first. I really would like you to come with me, Vivien. They know about your work. You could write your own ticket. It's hard to imagine being there without you. Well, I thank you for thinking of me, Doctor. But I think I should stay here. We could do great things there. Wouldn't it be fun to do it one more time? One more time. Hmm. I like what I'm doing. Teaching, helping people along. Working with the young doctors. I like it here at Hopkins. Yeah, I... I guess you got your own things going on here now. I recognize this man. That man looks very distinguished up there. Well, thank you, Vivien. That was a while ago. Yeah. I'm feeling the years now. Hmm, yes yes. We all are now. You know, Vivien... they say you haven't really lived unless you have a lot to regret. I regret... I have some regrets. But I think we should remember not what we lost... but what we've done. All the lives we saved and we did. We saved plenty, didn't we, Vivien? Yes, we did. No. Vivien, it's Helen. I'm sorry to tell you that Dr. Blalock passed away in his sleep last night. We see death every day. It doesn't make it any easier, does it? I'm very sorry. Today, we honor someone who never took a course in medical school, and still became one of our greatest teachers of medicine. This individual helped change the way we understand how the human heart works forever. And now I'm honored to read, "The Board of Regents of this, the Johns Hopkins University, in consideration of an innovative scientist, an outstanding teacher, and a skilled clinical technician, has this day awarded this honorary doctorate to Mr. Vivien Thomas." Congratulations, Dr. Thomas. Thank you, Dr. Taussig. I'm not accustomed to being in the limelight. So being placed in the position I find myself in now makes me quite humble and a little proud. When I put my hammer and saw down 40 years ago and was offered an opportunity to work with a young surgeon, I had no idea that I'd be able to make a mark on an institution as prestigious as this one. I had no idea that I... would have any contribution to make to medicine that would merit this type of recognition. I simply say thank you to all of my family, and all of my friends who are here, and to all of my friends who could not be here. I thank you very much. Thank you.
