I promise you we will make deadline. She just had a bit of a rough patch, no big deal. She's back on track. I know. And if I can, I will try to get her out of here. We'll find a new environment. Yes. Don't worry, it's gonna be fine. I promise you, she's ready right now. I can see her. Yes, she's right here. Have I ever lied to you before? All right, all right. OK. Fine. Bye. OK, bye. Oh, you're going up? I'm leaving, I'll tell you about it later. Darling, you will never guess who I met today. I met the most amazing author. I mean, this guy, he is a true chameleon, just like you. You will one day really enjoy meeting him. Two months is all we have left. They already gave us an extension. If we don't deliver on time, they're going to tear up the contract. I know, I know, I know. I just... I can't find my style anymore. It's like I can't tell the difference between the books that Norman wrote from the books that I wrote. Exactly, and that's why they are paying you so handsomely. Yeah, but it's... It's not the same. It's like with Norman's books, I can feel the emotion behind the words. Sweetheart, you're not taking your pills. Sweetie, you're inconsistent. I'm telling you, if you don't take your meds, if you don't take them, you're never going to get over what happened to you. Max, I can't remember anything anymore. It's like there's nothing inside of me except this big, dark void. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know this has got to be really, really hard on you too. It's OK. And I do appreciate you buying more time. Shh, come on. What are we gonna do, Max? I don't know. I mean, you're the one that has to... No. No, I'm asking you what are we going to do? We get this guy to finish the book, and we delivered on time, and I promise you, no one will know the difference. And then for the next one, who knows? Or we go back. Have a drink. You OK? Yeah. I'm a little tired, but I'm fine. You? You did the right thing coming back here Alice. One must confront the past, even when memories are painful. Even when one has no memories? Especially when one has no memories. Come on. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry I wasn't here to greet you. I just went to town to get some groceries and thought that... No problem. Everything is exactly how we left it last year, which is perfect. Nothing ever really changes around here. The agency tells me your name is Sara... Sara? - Sara. Sara, perfect. This is my lovely wife, Alice. Pleasure. And the agency also tells me that you're live in, which is great. That means all you have to worry about is getting better and finishing the book. Thank you for the flowers, Sara. White roses are my... Favorite. I know, ma'am. I'll go get the luggage from the car. Oh no, don't bother. I'll grab them. I've got to make a phone call anyway. Why don't you take Alice to her room? I'll just put this in the kitchen. Don't worry, Alice. Everything will be just fine, you'll see. I heard you're a writer. Uh, not really, no. I'd like to be, but... So what do you do? No, actually, I do write, but I don't have anything to show. Do you understand? Not really. I write what other people tell me to write under their name. In America, they call us ghostwriters. Well, that does sound interesting. Do you read? I mean, do you... Do you enjoy reading? Not a lot, magazines mainly, sometimes a few best sellers. Oh, well do you know Norman Dunst? Only by name. So are you from around here? Yeah, born and raised. I never even been abroad. Really? Yeah, I'd like to go to Los Angeles and become an actress. I just can't bare the thought to spend the rest of my life on this island. Yeah. Oh, no, leave it. I'll take care of it, thank you. OK, well, I'm done here. Would you like me to run your bath? Yeah, no, no. Actually, I think I'm going to lay down for a little bit. Of course, yeah. Oh, no. Actually, maybe uh, I'll write a little bit. Because that is why I'm here, is... is to write. But you can go. Fine. Thank you. OK You know it would have been funny, outsourcing the book that was outsourced to you. Funny? How? Babe, come on. Where did your sense of humor go? Passing somebody the job that somebody had passed to you and they weren't running to the bookstore to go buy it? It's Marx Brothers stuff. How is Norman, anyway? You know, I wouldn't be surprised that we woke up one morning, turned on the news and found he killed his entire family with a kitchen knife? Sadly, that would also be the end of us. Babe, I'm joking. Come on, he's like always wasted. The only thing keeping him alive is you. I'm sorry, I'm just tired. You know, I understand. I'm going to bed, OK? Is this really my house? I mean, how... how is it I can't remember anything. You were in a coma for two weeks. I know, but it's just like gone. Hey. I'm scared, Max. I know. Come on, let's go to bed. OK. Max? Max? Max, I can't find my pills. I know I packed them, but I can't find them anywhere. OK, um, I have Dr. Mill's prescription. We'll go to the pharmacy tomorrow. Just try to get some sleep, all right? Hello. Hi. You know which piece? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, bye. Good morning, ma'am. Coffee? Yes, please. And don't call me ma'am, I feel old. Call me Alice. Of course, ma'am. Oops, I mean Alice. Um, fresh orange juice, fruit salad, low fat yogurt, I hope it's OK. It's perfect, thank you. Some say love, some say they fall from love, some they hate. And you're not alone, but I'm not for sure when it feels as though you're gonna break. Oh. Jesus, what happened? There was somebody in the bathroom, they were staring at me. Look at me, there's nobody here. There's nobody here. It's me, OK? Relax. Are you sure of what you saw? Yes, yes. There... there was somebody staring at me. Listen, uh, maybe it's just memories resurfacing. It could be a flash, OK? Don't worry about it. Look, here are your pills. Just take them. Oh, thank you. Relax, darling, relax. It's OK. It's OK. Thank you. So you are him. Basically, you think and feel like him. Would you like to explain to me how it works? I read all of his books until he could no longer write them. The publisher sends me outlines, like summaries of the plot with loads of notes in them. And we have a few meetings with the editors and I get to work. And I promise to tell no one what I just told you. Wow, is it hard? Writing under someone else's name I felt freer than I ever have. Do you know what I mean? And why don't you write books in your own name? Oh, well, I'm not that type of person. I don't have it in me to create stories or characters. I'm better at imitating. I find that hard to believe. Besides, what's the difference, really? Identity is such a abstract concept. I mean, even when we ourselves, we are imitating others subconsciously. When you write, how do you know how far to push yourself? I mean, didn't you have to empathize with your characters in order to make it work? Norman used to say all characters must have their reasons, but also their secrets. You think? Did you know that this was my house and I have absolutely no memory of it, nothing. Last year when I was here with my husband, Max, I was working on one of his books, and I got into this terrible car accident on the coastal road nearby. I went into a coma. And two weeks later, I woke up in a hospital in LA. At least, that's what they told me happened. Who did they tell you to be? Hmm? Nah, I'm only joking. I know you are you. I'm going to have to get back to work. Thank you for the chat. Thanks for the juice. Are you in love with your husband? Wow, um, what a question. Did he make a pass at you? Well, I uh, I wouldn't blame him. You are beautiful. I should read the book. Thank you. Claudia, how are you? You've got the wrong person. It must be you. It's been a while, but I will never forget a fact like yours. I'm sorry, you're mistaken. Good morning, Alice. Since your rent's coming down, I thought I'd bring you the breakfast in bed. Careful, it's hot. Is something wrong? Oh, please, Sara. This is just embarrassing. I have no idea what you're talking about. Listen, let me make myself clear. There are many things that I will tolerate, but not this. I'm going to have to speak to my husband. She's just a girl from town. Is she your girlfriend? No. Are you in love with her? Why were you looking at me like that? I'm sorry it's... I guess instead of just being shocked to see you, I got more excited. Well, don't bring her around here anymore, understood? Of course. Yeah. So how you feeling? Like someone who goes for the first time to a place they've already been. Like deja vu? Probably. Thank you. Thanks. What do you think of her? She seems really nice. Did she tell you about her plans to come to LA and become an actress? Another actress in LA? Original. I know, right? Oh, tomorrow morning I have to go to London. It'll only be a few days. Oh, really? What for? Contacts, PR. While we're here in Europe, everyone's in London. OK. Great. I'm gonna go read. Your husband didn't drink his coffee? Why don't you have it. Please sit down. I didn't tell you when I was here last year, and I got that terrible crash, someone died. At times, the thought of it absolutely devastates me. Then other times, I get the feeling that they just made it all up, to fool me, so that I would no longer be in control of myself and they could exploit me. You really don't remember anything? I wish I could help you. Yeah, I know. I can tell. To new friendships. And new beginnings. Hi. I'm not going to jump, in case that's what you were thinking. What if I wanted to push you? I guess you didn't think about that. Nobody's out here, and that current is so strong, that it could be months before your body washed up. Just why would you do such a thing? People do things for the strangest reasons. I don't think I could ever intentionally harm anyone. That's what they all say. Very good people, because there is no incentive they have. But when there is one, usually that's when things get more complicated. Wow, uh, should I be impressed or scared? Up to you. Are you American? Yeah, how could you tell? Your accent. Of course, silly me. Well, I won't steal more of your precious time. You look exhausted. Do you want a ride? Well, um, thanks for the ride. That was very kind of you. Instead of murdering me, you gave me a ride home. Well, don't get used to it. Oh, you're back. I've prepared a bath for you. Thank you. What do you prefer? Lemon verbena or milk and honey? You decide. Milk and honey. Sweet and warm. So I was thinking. About what? There's a place I want to take you to. I wanted to give you a present. Present? For what? Just because. For being you. Where are we going? Well, you're just going to have to wait and see. So you're really keeping me in suspense here. It's a surprise. I know, but I hate surprises. Tell me where we're going. OK. I'm thinking about your scar and why you always try to hide it. I really think there's a beauty in your scar. You just haven't found it yet. And? A tattoo? Something small, delicate, maybe even a flower. I thought that perhaps changing it into something beautiful could help you accept what happened that night, you know? That when you look at it, you'll be reminded of the beautiful things in life, that every day is worth living for. Maybe sometimes you look at it then think of me. Max would kill me if I get another tattoo. It's OK. I'm sorry, it was a stupid idea. Let's go. Come on. It's perfect. For the first time in ages, I feel so alive, and it's all because of you. I'm taking you shopping. Let's go spend some cash. And look what we have here. Now that is a fine piece of ass. You two look like you're up for a good time. How's about to go get ourselves some drinks, huh? Get out of our way. Or what? Going to hit me with your purse? I said get the fuck away from us. Oh, aren't you are a feisty little bitch. You know, we do the smart ass cunts where I come from? That was amazing. You were incredible. Well, I don't know about you, but I certainly need a drink. Do you want one? No, thank you. So why don't you put on this little number. I want to see if it looks how I pictured in my mind. Oh, you've been thinking about me? In ways you wouldn't even imagine. Well, tonight we're going to switch things around. Oh, really? I decide when you touch me. Tell me you want me. I want you, Sara. I know |I'm going to make love to you. Hmm. I want you to watch. Hello? Darling, you're still sleeping? What time is it? It's almost noon. Did you have a rough night? Actually, um, I don't even remember the last time I slept this well. Look, um, I have some really bad news. Norman tried to kill himself. Norman what? He tried to commit suicide and he almost succeeded. Oh... Oh my God. Yeah, he's in really bad shape. Look, I can't talk right now, but um, I'll tell you everything when I get home, right? Yeah. Sara? Sara? Hello? Sara? Hello, it's Sara. I can't get this call right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. Oh my God. Damn it. Sara? Sara. I wanted to give you a present. I feel so alive. Alive. Alive. Alive. Are you OK? What are you doing here? You dropped something yesterday. I found it near your gate and I thought must have fallen from your pocket. Oh, I don't think so. I didn't have anything in my pocket. Like this is my handwriting. Um, but I have no recollection whatsoever what this... I'm sorry, can I offer you a drink? Yeah, I would love one. Um, my... my apologies. I'm um, really not very good company right now. I'm... I just um, I don't feel so good. Do you live here alone? Uh, no, no. No, there's my husband Max. But he's away on a business trip. And there's a woman who works here, but she must have gone out to get some groceries. What is it that you are suffering from? At the moment, everything. Well, I think that people are more beautiful when they suffer. Really? Yeah. I think that happiness is a false myth. Hmm. Well, I got to go. So I'll leave you to your suffering. You haven't even um, touched your drink. I don't like iced tea. Oh. Oh, God. Sara, Sara, where have you been? I couldn't find you and your phone was switched off. Do you know this guy? Listen, I have to tell you something. Who is he? Who cares? Norman tried to commit suicide. Your writer? Yes, yes. And I'm absolutely devastated. I mean, I didn't think I would feel this way, because I only met him once or twice. But then I couldn't find you. And I started having these hallucinations outside. I mean, I'm not sure if they were hallucinations, or if they were just memories coming up, but I am really... I am not well, Sara. Everything is going to be fine. I know, but I... But I feel odd, OK? I feel a little bit odd. Like I'm turning into him, or maybe he's turning into me. It's just really confusing. But you're not him, and you're not dying. All right, let's see you. Hello? Hi, detective. I did the test. - And so? Who did you get the pill from? Definitely not from a doctor. What do you mean? Well, they aren't exactly antidepressants. So what's in it? Valium laced with LSD. Whoever uses these pills is in for a really bad trip. Hey. Hey, what happened? Hey. Went to buy some breakfast and the damn engine just gave out Oh, you mind if I have a look? Be my guest Might actually look like you know what you're doing. Well, I grew up in a ranch in Texas, and my dad taught me how to fix cars before I knew how to read. He always wanted a son, even though he never said so. Well, you know what they say. You should never judge a book by its cover. You sure are a woman of many talents. Yes, I am. Water, you got any? Yeah. Al right. That should do the trick. You want a ride home? Um, no, no, actually. I think I'm going to do some more exercise. All of your wonderful food is making me fat. Well, you couldn't be fat even if you tried. Besides, got a better idea of how we can burn some calories. Hmm, I like that idea. Come on, let's go. I'll take you to my favorite place. You are hard to resist. So is this where you take all of your women? Nah, only this one, once. You're easier to impress. So what about us? Good question. If Norman dies, things are going to get rough. I'll have to go back to LA and everything will become even more difficult than it already is. It was only a matter of time before you would have left. It was a fling, we'll just leave it at that. Yeah, but I don't want to go home. After the accident, everything was gray. Now, it's in color. Then stay, stay here with me. I can't. I have to go back and sort things out. Who knows? Maybe find myself another Norman. I just don't want to lose you. But you don't even know me. I mean, what if you got to know me better and decided I'm not the woman you thought I was. I'm going to take that risk. And Max? I don't think I was ever really in love with him. I think I'm more just dependent on him. Then take me away with you. Depend on me, on us. Am I doing this right? Here, I'll show you. - OK. - You just gently... Yeah. Gently press down. Like that? Uh huh, just like that. OK. Yeah. It's more difficult than it appears at first. See? Alice. Oh, hey. You're um... You're home early. How is he? Did you manage to finish something? I'm sorry, I was asking you about Norman? Norman? I know you asked me about Norman. Maybe he's clinging to fucking life right now, how about that? Huh? What if he dies? You have to finish this book. You have to write something. You're stalling. Anything. I don't care what you write, just finish the fucking book. I can't, Max, OK? I'm trying. I'm really trying here, but I'm not a well woman. OK? Something is not right. I'm having these fucking hallucinations, these pills aren't working. - Excuses. These are all excuses. You know, we should have never come back here. No, no. Yeah. It was all my fault. He's going to die. Oh my God. We have to contact this other writer in LA. We got to get back there. Look, I'm going to book a couple of tickets tomorrow. No, Max. And if we can get back by tomorrow night... You're not listening to me, Max. I'm not leaving. What? Why? Um, I, um, I... I don't want to lose her. Lose who? Sara. Sorry, the maid? I think I'm in love with her. Are you listening to yourself? What do you mean, you're in love with her? Did you fuck her? Did you fuck her? Sarai Sarai Get your things and get out of here right now. I want to talk to Alice. She's not going to help you. I said get your things and get out of here. This is my house and you're fired. Now! Of course, maybe it's better I call your agency? That won't be necessary. No, no, no, no, no. Sara, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, Sara. Sara, come on. It's going to be OK. I'll smooth things over with him, we'll be together, it'll be fine. This is your husband, this is your life. I don't know what the fuck was I thinking. No, I can make this right. I can make this right. No, what? He's going to call my agency. It'll be fine, it'll be fine. My career will be over. God damn it, you had no right sending her away. Oh, no? And what did you expect me to do, sit here and watch? You destroyed us. You blew it. But this is different, Max. She can help me. She can help me better than anybody else. She can help you? How can she help you? - Well. - You're fucked in the head. No, you just... you don't understand. You're right. I don't understand. Well, where are you going? I'm going to stay at a hotel until I can organize a flight out of here. It's over. Max, Max, Max, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I never meant to hurt you, really. You destroyed us, just as you destroy everything. Sara, Sara, please pick up. Hello, it's Sara. I can't get this call right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. Scroll up, Who's calling it? What's the matter? Bad thoughts. Like? Forget it, you won't understand. OK, so what do we do now? Now it's just you and me. Relax, relax, relax. I've been waiting way too long for this. I don't want to fuck. Leave me alone. Shh. I don't... Max, I don't... Just knock it off. Just leave me alone. Ah, ah. Hello, it's Sara. I can't get this call right now, but leave a message and I'll call you back. Um, hi Sara, it's uh, it's me. Um, Max... Max left. Um, I just... I really want to see you. I want to touch you, I want to taste you, I want all of you. Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Max is staying at a hotel. I uh, I think I know where he is. So I'm going to go over there now and um, make sure he's OK. But, uh, I really want to be with you. I love you, only you. Please come home. Bye. Hi. Hello madam, what can I do for you? Um, I believe my husband, Max Kasar checked in today? Ah, yes. Just give me one second. Yes, I'll just get you a card made. Oh, great. Thank you. Have you got any luggage with you? Have I got any luggage? Uh, no, no. I've barely got my sanity with me today. There you go. Room 25, just down the hall to your left. Thank you. Have a good stay ma'am. And here I thought you'd be all broken hearted. What the fuck are you doing here? Sara? I... I... I don't understand. My God, Alice. You were not supposed to... Never supposed to know what? You were fucking my husband? Huh? Oh, you do him all along, didn't you? You were already lovers. And it was us, all of this just some sort of a sick fucking game? No, no Alice. You two disgust me. And you? You really broke my heart. Fuck. It's just so awful. Change of plans. I don't know. I just don't know anymore. Maybe |I've gone too far. It's... it isn't right. Sara, you can have everything you ever wanted, just like I promised. Le me just think about this. It's over Max. I don't want to be part of this. You are part of this. You are a big part of this, and she'll never take you back. You were the only good thing in her life, and you betrayed her. We betrayed her, Max. I only did what you told me to do, and I fucked up. She doesn't deserve this. The girl was most probably thrown all over the rocks during the fall, went in the sea. We never really closed the case, but I suppose you know most of this. Slowly putting the pieces together. We never found the body. So what are you going to do? Me? Uh huh. Eventually, I found out what happened. What type of person gives up easily? And you? I think you should have this. It can maybe help you. Thanks. Hello? All right, who is it? I'll be right down. I'll be right back. I'm sorry, do I know you? Can you please sit down with me and have a chat? We'll be only a minute. I'm here to talk about um, the young girl that is in your room, Miss Sara Borge. As you probably remember, and I'm sure you do, her twin sister died last year in a car accident. And if I'm not wrong, it was your wife that was running the car, am I right? So? So as you probably know, her body was never found. You know, in cases like this concerning the extreme resemblance of the two sisters, and the fact that they don't have any close relatives who can witness, it is quite difficult to establish with certainty which of the two sisters really died. Well, I've already told the police everything I know. So unless you have something to tell me, which it appears you do not, it's been a pleasure. Fucking bitch. Who's that? Who's calling? Uh. So you finally remembered. I thought I'd find you here. I hope I wasn't disturbing you. You're not about to jump, are you? Or you feeling decisive? That's your problem, Alice. You can't even make the simplest decision. You can't write a story. You write what other people tell you to write, and you do so in their style, so that nobody notices. What was it that Norman always used to say? Oh, that's right. All characters must have their reasons... But also their secrets. That's right, also their secrets. Oh, um, by the way, Norman's dead. Why are you doing this? After I cash in your life insurance, I'll sue the editor and Norman, or his heirs, if you'd like. And I'll prove that authorship and all the rights in the last novels belong to you. The sellers, millions of copies sold, not to mention all of our assets. I mean, that's got to be worth something, right? What about Sara? It's time, Alice. It will be a great way to go. Very dramatic. Goodbye, Alice. Sorry, Alice. I'm so sorry for what I've done. Please, forgive me. This time we move on. Out damn spot, out I say. One, two. "By then," is time 10 do it. Hell is murky. Hello. Hello. May 1? Thank you. Wow. Not too bad, eh? Still looking for that girl you met? I was hoping to find Alice. Alice is in town, she'll be back soon. You can wait for her, if you like. Sure. I'll go on rehearsing, if you don't mind. Fy, my lord, fy A soldier and afeard? Macbeth. Wow. Impressive. I adore Shakespeare. I have an audition coming up and this felt just right. You're studying to become an actress? Yep. Interesting. What need we fear who knows it when none can call power to account. You know, Alice showed me the video. It must have been strange for you. It's very touching. Yet, who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him. It's odd that this hasn't put an end to your relationship. On the contrary. I see. It made us stronger. It's like a... uh, sentimental exchange, am I right? Have you made some new discovery, something that even I don't know about? I saw what happened that night on the cliff. Maybe he would've showed her, but he hadn't yet. Don't tell me you came all the way across the ocean to tell us that? Any other unnoticed detail in that video? You look like the innocent flower, be the serpent under it. Act one, scene five. Let me offer you something to drink first. Maybe a glass of iced tea would be good for you. Now, I still have to figure out whether you're Claudia or Sara? Or maybe I never will? What are you trying to say? That I killed my own sister? Well, did you? Or did she never exist in the first place? You know, for a small town detective, you have quite a vivid imagination. Regardless, I still know what is legal and what is not. And by the way, I hate iced tea. What the fuck are we gonna do now? Shh, it's OK. I know who you are. You are both of you, and I'm fine with it. Now, help me move the body before he stains the floor. Hello, how are you? And you? Very well, thank you. What's your name? - Kristina. OK. With a K or a C? KRISTINA Yes, K. - With a K, OK. Well, I do hope you enjoy the book. Thank you. Bye bye now. Hello, how are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you as well. What's your name? Alexia. Alexia, how do I spell that? A-L. A-L. E-X-I-A. OK. Oh, thank you so much. I'm glad you enjoy my work. Have a good one. Thank you, same to you. Bye bye now. Hi. Hi. What's your name? I'm glad you're a fan. Hope you enjoy it. Bye now. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you as well. My pleasure. And what's your name? Annie. Annie with a Y or an IE?
