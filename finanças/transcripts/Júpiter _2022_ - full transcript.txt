What are you doing, clown? Stop right there, man! Wait. Wait. Júpiter, I'm taking a trip. - Where to? - Switzerland. - For how long? - That grant I wanted came through. Two years. Cool. Am I going as well? Do you think I'm a good godmother? Do I take good care of you? That's why you have godmothers. What did your mother tell you about your dad? That he died. Yes, your mother was very hurt. Isadora was so dramatic. Júpiter. Your mom gave me this letter before dying. I don't need a dad. I have you. Everyone needs a dad. I think it would be good if you spent time with him. - Does he want to live with me? - He doesn't know it yet. - Doesn't know what? - Nothing. Doesn't know I'll be living with him? Doesn't know he has a son. Let me go with you to Switzerland? Mario? Mario? My love? I think he's starting to wake up. We should call the doctor. Mario. Talk to me. Mr. Mario? Mr. Mario. You had a heart attack. Things are fine now. It was close. We had to do surgery. It went very well. - The outlook is excellent for you. - It is. You're very lucky, my love. Dr. Gastão saved you in the middle of the road. I was telling to your wife that you will have to be kept under observation. He's okay, very stable. Things are looking good. - Are you feeling any pain? - No. You're feeling good, right? Well, I'll discharge you tomorrow. That's good. This hospital's awful. You'll have to rest for another week, no leaving the house. Slowly, you can venture out. But since you can be dizzy or weak, it's always good to use a cane. I've provided your diet to Mrs. Teresa. Make sure you stick to it. Mrs. Teresa, may I have a moment in private with your husband? Of course. - Excuse me. - Thank you. You bastard. I should've let you die on that road. You do your job, and I was doing mine. Who told you to cheat on your wife? You're calling my wife now to say that you didn't find anything. Hello, Mrs. Clara? It's Mario, Mario Sant'anna, the detective. I'm okay. I'm just calling to say that it's all good. Yes. Your husband's day was exemplary. Right. Yes. He's a real saint. Yes. He is. No worries. I was just doing my job. And you. Take care. Goodbye. Jerk. - Are you sure this is it? - I'm sure, Júpiter. I'm sure. Your dad's leaving the hospital. He's on his way. And what if he died? He hasn't died. He's on his way. - What if he doesn't like me? - Dammit. Júpiter, he's your dad. There's no like or dislike. It's time for him to look after you. Keep calm. It will be good. You'll see. "Dear Lucia, it won't be that long now." I love this life so much, but I don't think it loves me back. It decided to abandon me early, like all the lovers I had. Life can betray you, my friend. It betrays you like a bad boyfriend and leaves you forever. Knowing you'll take care of Júpiter after my death leaves me at peace. "Thank you. Thank you so much, my dear friend." Alright, lady. But what...? Please, continue. You'll soon understand. "I have a confession to make. I wasn't the most honest friend." I mean about Júpiter's dad. It wasn't a one-night stand, like I always said. It was much more than that. We were together for two months, in Florianópolis. "His name is Mario Sant'anna." "Júpiter knows nothing," and Mario doesn't know he has a son with me. Despite me asking, I don't want you to give up on your dreams or that my son become a burden to you. If, for whatever reason, you can't take care of Júpiter, please try to find his father. He used to live here in Rio. Mario, despite being very immature, is a kind-hearted man. If need be, I'm sure he'll know to do the right thing. Forgive me for the load I'm putting on you, but there's no one else I can trust this much. "Thank you, thank you so much. With love, Isadora." I have some photos here. ISA AND MARIO LOVE, LOVE, 1999 Isadora. Get out! Get out! Do you know what this is? Do you know? You bought it for me 18 years ago in Florianópolis. Calm down, dear. Wait. Did she pick it out? Well? You went there and had a son with a slut, some ordinary slut! It was just something that happened. Do you think there's any way you could have hurt me more than this? It was 18 years ago, Teresa. You have a son, Mario! What son? Sweetheart, relax. - I'll send him packing right now. - No, you won't! He's your son! That's what she says! And is it not possible? It is. You're so disgusting! What do you want me to do? You're going to take care of him. He's your son. What do you think? You'll throw him out? - What if he's not my son? - And what if he is? You won't abandon the kid. You won't! If you throw him out, I'll throw you out first! And case closed! Well, I'm traveling tomorrow night to Switzerland. Júpiter has my number for emergencies, e-mail, everything he needs. Wait. Wait. But just like that? His suitcase is in the car. I tried to give you a little more notice, but you were in the hospital. Well, I honestly hope that you get along. He asked a lot about you. Take care, Júpiter. Now your dad will take good care of you. And call me any time. Don't forget. Promise? Is this the oatmeal, my love? Delicious. Do you always sleep there? No. Only when my wife learns I have a son. How old are you again? 17. How should I call you? Mario or Dad? - Call me what you want. - Right. Well? What? What'll you call me? Dad. - Have you finished school? - Yes. I completed high school, but I didn't pass college finals. So I decided to take a gap year. Great. - And what were you trying for? - Medicine. Wouldn't you like to go for a walk, look around, get to know the neighborhood? No. I'd rather stay here with you so we can know each other better. But you'll be stuck with me here in the house because I'm not allowed out for a week. Alright. You're gonna stay here, like that, a whole week looking at me? - Didn't you die? - No. If I die, who'll have sex with your mom? And who's this? Your boyfriend? This is Júpiter, my assistant. He'll help you. I'm on forced rest. You're always resting. You don't do anything. - Hang on. My job's intellectual, jerk. - Intellectual my ass. Júpiter, go help Baiacu. Baiacu is that gay there. Come on, kid. You're securing this. Hold that here for me. Hold that. Got it tight? Dammit! Does that thing work? It's auto-reverse. I've got a box full of cassettes. Grab the one with handwriting. Pink Floyd. You don't need no education What, Júpiter? What's with that face? You don't like Pink Floyd? Not that much. I find them a little depressing. In fact, a little weird. Weird? Pink Floyd? The best band in the world. "We don't need no education". Okay, what's the problem? Do you think that's the right song for a dad to play for a son? I don't follow. What are you getting at, Júpiter? Nothing, it's just weird, right? Because parents want their kids to study. And the lyrics say, "We don't need no education". - Which means that we... - What a bunch of crap, Júpiter. Screw the lyrics. What matters is the beat. But there's a message in those lyrics. The message is about breaking it all. It's about total revolution. But, to understand that, you need the lyrics. Look, sometimes, when in a revolution like this, you have to forget the lyrics to understand the music and the lyrics themselves. You see? It's a total revolution. It's in the beat. Now pay attention. You'll go in and take pictures of the two of them. They won't have sex there, but they'll be enjoying their romance. Keep a look out. There's always kissing. It's a fetish. Be discreet, low-profile. Don't let them notice you. You're a disgrace. No ounce of professionalism. You tainted my name. I built a name for myself in this profession. You took photos of fish, Júpiter. Fish! Dammit. I had such faith in you. Now what? Dammit. Come on. Don't be like that. It happens. It was dark in there. It's hard, right? Anyway, it's my fault, right? You're too green, need more training. Let's do this. Get the camera case back there. There's a little camera inside. You can have it. As a present. Thank you. But it's for practicing, right? Pick someone on the street and trail them, take photos. Who? "Who, who?" Who cares? Pick someone. Take pictures. Stay behind them. Take pictures and practice. - But not me, right? - No, of course. I don't count, right? Along with practicing, it'll get you out of the house and to stop annoying me. Thanks, dad. JÚPITER? HI, MY LOVE HOW I'VE MISSED YOU IT'S LUCIA HI, GODMOTHER THINGS ALRIGHT? EVERYTHING'S FINE REALLY MISSING YOU YOU NEVER CALL IS IT NICE THERE? IT'S BEAUTIFUL YOU'D LOVE IT ARE THINGS OKAY? IS YOUR DAD COOL? YES IS HE TREATING YOU WELL? I GUESS SO LOVE YOU WAIT! TELL ME MORE LIKE WHAT? WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY? NOTHING OKAY, SWEETHEART LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN COME VISIT ME IN A FEW MONTHS I'M GLAD YOU AND YOUR DAD ARE GETTING ALONG LOVE YOU. KISSES SAME HERE. LOVE YOU. Hi, Júpiter. Damn, you took a long time. - So, did it work out with the camera? - Yes. Fagundes, this is Júpiter, my assistant Pleasure, Júpiter. How's things? Check. Mate. Loser. The Chess Federation's President lost for me. Bye, Teresa! - See you, Mario. - See you. Pleasure, Júpiter. Gonna play against Mario? Set up the pieces. I'll be back. Well, Júpiter, how's it going? - Are things alright here at home? - Sure. And Mario? Where is he? I think he went upstairs. I'm waiting to play with him. It's not possible he's that bad, Mario. You're exaggerating. I'm telling you, the kid's so dumb. A good kid, polite, but he's brainless. You're the buzzkill. When do the DNA results come out? Who knows? It should be coming soon. All I need is that nerd to be my son. I think you're getting attached to him. Now go talk to him. Me? You. You should, no? You're better at these things. Dammit. I have to answer this garbage. Júpiter, play in my place. And don't screw up. There's money on the line. Olivier. I know. It was just a screw-up. No, well. You're completely right. Right. Well, I've been convalescing, haven't been well. It was a setback. Yes. I know. I had to send Júpiter, see? The kid's still inexperienced. Sure. He... No, not stupid. Stupid, no. He's a little slow. Yes. I'll do that. Okay. What about that new job? No. This time I'll go. I'm fine, man. I'm fine. I'm in action. No, I won't bring the kid. Don't worry. Don't worry. You know that I can do my job just fine. Yes. Fine. Yes. I know São Pedro. I have a friend who lives there. It's nice. Right. Right, give me the address and all that, and I'll go. Okay? Per diems? Wonderful. Fine. Okay. Right. Just send it all to me. The address and all details. Okay, Olivier. Don't worry. Rest easy. All good. See you. What's that look? What happened? You won't believe it. Hi. I've never seen anyone play like that. In other words, he plays better than his dad? - Hi, Teresa. - Hi, Fagundes. So, Júpiter's really good. He's been lucky. Lucky. - Júpiter's in first place. - He's tied with Fagundinho. There are still two more rounds. My money's on Júpiter. You're representing the Chess Federation of Rio. It's serious. Bye, kids. It was great. 'Till next time. Fagundinho, don't be sad, okay? - Bye, Fagundes. - Wait, Mario. Hang on. Come, Júpiter. We have to arrange our trip. - What trip? - What? To Friburgo. - The match against Urishchenko. - Urishchenko? Yes, our top four players will play against Urishchenko. A simultaneous match in Friburgo. - Against Boris Urishchenko? - But you didn't say anything. I didn't think Júpiter was going to make it. And the champion's father will take the kids. Wait, Fagundes. What rule is this? What? An adult has to take the kids. As the champion's dad, you'll take them. No, no. You take them. You're the president, dude. Well, I used to take them when Fagundinho won. Look, Mario has a Jeep. - Me? Do I have a Jeep? - Sure, everyone can fit in. Then we're on! The Federation will cover it all. It's next Sunday, July 15th. No, that won't work. Sunday I've got a meeting in São Pedro. São Pedro? Well, that's perfect! São Pedro's next to Friburgo. Listen up. You can leave the night before to São Pedro. You spend the night, go to your meeting, and, after the meeting, you go to Friburgo. - The match is in the afternoon. - No, Fagundes. Where will they stay while I'm stuck in the meeting? It'll complicate things. Come on. I don't know. Leave them at the hotel. They're old enough. Not a chance! No way! Look, the GPS is telling us to go back and take that exit. - Are we lost? - I knew it! I found out what I did wrong. I just had to take the pawn. We are not lost. No. The match I lost to this guy. Mate in four moves. You're lost and don't want to say so. People, we are not lost. I lost, okay? But over a dumb thing. Actually, if you had taken my pawn, I'd've attacked your knight with my bishop, and you'd have lost your rook as well. What if we stopped to ask someone? No, we're stopping. It's here on the map. - Not if I attacked your bishop. - Right, but you didn't. And, if you had, you would have lost the queen. See, loser? I bet Júpiter can beat you now with his eyes closed. - That I'd like to see. - Cool. - Go ahead, Júpiter. - I can't play with eyes closed. - No? - No. What's the problem? Every good player knows how. That's basics. Your dad never taught you? Ridiculous! He taught me other things like not being a moron like you. Burn. Moron? Go to hell! Stop it, people. What's this nonsense? He called me a moron! Because you are. You're an adult! So what? Am I not allowed to call you a moron? At least I don't have a bastard son. Fagundinho! Let's stop this right now! Stop it now! What's with you? Júpiter, let go! Let go now! Let go! We'll go home, dammit! Damn it all to hell! Stop! Stop! Fagundinho! Damn it. Hell. Help me here! Off, off! Holy crap, you two! Damn it all to hell! Stop it! Dammit! Forget it! You can kill each other! Stop it, Júpiter. Let go of the kid. Stop, stop, stop. Over. Over, you two! But what the hell? Dammit! Two boys. Let's go now. But no fighting! Understood? No stupidity! Young man. The problem is the fan belt. Dammit. And now what? Now you'll need a tow. - Do you have insurance? - I don't. Well, if it's just one person, I could drive you to Miranópolis. There's a station about 40 minutes from here. You can get a tow truck there. Thank you. Júpiter, you go. I'll go with him. I'm a girl. I'm not staying in the middle of nowhere. No, I think that's dangerous. You're a girl. And so? Júpiter'll protect me. Right, Júpiter? I will. I will. Alright, alright. Fine. Okay, okay, okay. That was Carlão. He'll be here with the tow truck in half an hour. I'm thirsty. Did you bring any money? No. I left it in the car. And I left mine in my bag. There's a water spigot next to the pump. You can drink all you want. What now? Do you want to smoke a joint? A joint? You've got a joint? I do. Do you smoke? I've never tried. Want to give it a try? So, you forgot your money but remembered a joint. I hide it in my underwear. Well? Look at Fagundinho's stupid move. - Fagundinho? - What? You're not upset with me calling you a moron, right? No. I said you had a bastard son. We're even. No, I think "bastard" is worth at least five "morons". Fine, but remember he was the one who called me a moron first. Sure, but "bastard child" is much more serious, because it's true. Moron' is just name-calling. Even if you really are a moron. No, no. But Mario said it in a way that was clearly his opinion. It wasn't just name-calling. If it's a matter of opinion, it's even less aggressive. He thinks you're a moron, it's his opinion, not a fact. In his case, he has a real bastard son. That's a fact, not an opinion. You're much more aggressive, because it must be awful to have a bastard child. Yes. Yes, that's true. But then, if what I said is true, there shouldn't have been a problem. Truth is truth. Period. Do you think so? Some things are true but we don't mention it as to not offend others. That's the basis of civilization. It's the white lie. If we didn't have white lies, we wouldn't have civilization. - We'd have no cities, no families. - And no bastard children. Because without families, there are no bastards. Because everyone's a bastard. Could you imagine? Awful. Feeling better? I'm hungry. Me, too. Now what? Now we wait until it passes. It didn't pass. I'm still hungry. Seriously. Me too. It's the munchies. Stay here. I'll go to the store. What'll you do in the shop without money? I've worked a few times with my dad. He's a detective. So what? I can go in and out without them noticing me. It's not that hard. It's just knowing how to be discreet. This is a shotgun. It's a directional high sensitivity microphone. This foam is to protect it from the wind. These are my binoculars. This one is my flashlight. This is the Tele-200. It's my darling. And this one is my blackjack, my head cracker. At last. I still can't believe you were arrested. And worse! You even got Luana arrested. We weren't arrested. We didn't go to jail. We just... - Got caught stealing Mary Jane. - Luana must be disgusted. And she was into you. - You think? - She was all over you! You ruin it, man. Now it's over. Damn. Why not go over, apologize, tell her you're in love? I remembered one thing. You're really screwed, man. - Why? - Her dad. Her dad's a psychopath policeman. He'll eat you alive when he finds out. Luana's last boyfriend I think spent two days in prison. Just because her dad caught them kissing. Prison. In a cell, alone with a murderous criminal. It seems that they raped the guy, too. I don't know. If you go to prison, you get raped. Prison's not the punishment. - Rape's the punishment. - True. - Now what? - You'd better go there, man. Right. I'll go. Yes. 'Cause you're scared, or 'cause you like her? Don't know. Can't say. I think you could take her some Mary Jane. Hey, my love. I just arrived in São Pedro. Where are you? It's hell with these kids. Kids are such a handful. It sucks. I'm glad I'm going to see Urishchenko. Sorry for making you go through all this. Okay? I love you lots. Call me back. Bye. Hello. What? You're divine and gracious Majestic statue From love, God chiseled you Carved out with the passion Of the soul of the prettiest flower With the finest fragrance The favorite of all By the hummingbird If God was so merciful In this region Bright and framed Astonishing being Your heart, Speared with mine Nailed and crucified Upon the cross On your gasping chest You're the ultimate form Majestic statue Perennial soul My first and only love You're God's most Perfect flower You're God's creation That buries love Into every heart The smile, the faith, and the pain In olent sandals Tasteful And sorrowful Like dreaming with flowers Milky star Royal mother You have all the beauty At its finest Holy nature I'm sorry to confess I shall adore you forever Flower, I can't resist My God, how sad it is The uncertainty of love I suffer more waiting Than I'd by proposing I swear to Almighty's feet With touching prayers On taking and giving I worship your gratitude After redeeming my desires In clouds of kisses I'll find you to the end To the end of it all Okay, boys. I'm going to my investigation with Júpiter and then we continue the trip. - Where is he? - He argued with Luana last night, said he'd take a walk, and hasn't come back. That kid loves disappearing. And Luana? In her room and says she won't come down. - Can't you do it on your own? - No, it won't work. It's a complicated job. It requires at least two of us. Here's the deal. The client suspects that his wife has an affair with her dentist. Why? She's been getting a root canal treatment for three months. Every Saturday at 11h30 she has an appointment. And then he plays with her canal. Do you get me? Here's the plan. This is a tool that triggers the toilet flush. You have to lift the tank's lid and press the valve down. Then you stick in this piece so that it holds the valve still and the water won't stop running. Got it? Once it's done, close the lid as not to raise suspicion. Before that, stuff the bowl with toilet paper. Use two rolls of toilet paper. Water will start to overflow all over the bathroom. Call for the receptionist who'll be going crazy trying to sort out the whole mess. One of you helps her and distracts her at the same time. The other go into the office to take photos of the act. Okay? Here's a copy of the key. Then you both leave quickly. I'll leave the engine running to speed things up. Vincent's father's case. Luana's father's case. Prison. - Dammit, man. You took a dump? - I had to. I couldn't hold it. I was going to flush it as normal and then clog it, but it did it on its own. It's defective for real. - Are you the team from Rio? - Yes. - Pleasure. Mario. This is Vicente. - Pleasure. - This is Luana. - Hi there. - That's Fagundinho. - I've heard you're something. Júpiter is the real deal. Okay. Where's he? Urishchenko's here. The match starts in half an hour. - Do you need anything? - Actually, we could use a shower because he didn't have time to clean himself, and coffee. Buckets of coffee. Damn, Fagundinho! What a stupid move! You gave you rook away! Hey, kid. What's up with you? My dad's gonna kill me. He'll kill you because you lost to the fourth best in the world? I lost in eight moves. Hey, Mario. How can I play like Júpiter? I lost. Twelve moves. Don't tell me you, too. Fagundinho is already so upset. - He lost in eight. - In eight? The putz! - Mario. - What happened? Júpiter took Urishchenko's knight. Come again? Júpiter took Urishchenko's knight? My Lord. Fifteen-minute intermission! Great. Great! I wanted him to give an interview during the break. It's for TV. Is that okay? Who? Júpiter? A TV interview? Sure. Going well? More or less. How about you? Feeling better? I've got a little headache. Why'd you drink so much last night? Can't say. Remember you asked me to marry you? I do. Sorry. Sorry for what? I liked it. You want to get married? No. Of course not, dummy. I'm 16 years old. Right. I liked it last night in the bathtub. It was clear you did. But you would've liked it more if you hadn't been drunk. Did you like it? I think I would've liked it more if you hadn't been drunk. I should probably stop getting drunk then. Dammit. Where have you been, man? There's a TV crew wanting to interview you. I'll go in a minute, dad. I'm talking to Luana. "In a minute", Júpiter? Luana, give us a sec, okay? Just a minute with this kid. Dammit. Get a grip! Women just get in the way. You have to seize the moment, work on your career, man. If you get stuck on Luana, you'll get distracted and play badly. This is our moment, Júpiter. Get a grip, man. If you're one of the last ones to lose, it will open a lot of doors. - What doors? - For you to go pro, man! To have a career. To play in the big leagues. Tournaments. Make some money. Live in Monaco, who knows? It's not worth wasting time with that girl. Listen to me. Tell us about how exciting it is to play against Boris Urishchenko. It's cool. Boris Urishchenko. Do you think you have a chance to beat him? I do. Júpiter, do you think that chess is important for young people? I... I don't know. I don't know. I haven't thought about it. Ever, I guess. And what does chess mean to you? Chess is a debate of ideas where the best argument wins. Thank you very much for the interview. See you. Good job, man. Very good. I'll even write down that last sentence. Excuse me, Luana. Excuse me. I can't waste time right now. What're you doing, kid? Go back there and play. Where's Luana? Luana went to the bus station. She's on her way to Rio. She said you were a jerk. - How could you let her go? - It's better this way. Focus. Get back there, and play! Let that girl go, dammit! Júpiter! Júpiter, wait, man! Júpiter! Let me talk to you! Hang on, man. Hang on. Hang on, Júpiter. Go back in there. Have you gone nuts? Why did you let her leave? Because she wanted to. What could I have done? You could've told me. I was trying to help you. You got hammered last night because of her. Now you're running after her. Do you want to get hurt? - Now you're worried about that? - I like you, Júpiter. You don't like me. You don't like anyone. That's not true. You're being unfair to me now. Do you know what you like? You like that chess clown show. You like seeing me win. - Because it's important in your life. - Luana's also important to me. Nonsense. You met that girl yesterday. So what? I like her. Dammit, can't you understand? She likes me too. Dammit. She's the first person who's ever genuinely liked me. Alright then. If you like her and she likes you, then you'll make up later and that's it. But now, go back and play. Don't embarrass me like this. You again. You, you, man. I'm not going back! Okay? Can't you understand that this is important for your future? Can't you see it? - It's just a match! - No, it's not just a match. It's the only thing you know how to do in life. Do you really think you'll get into medical school? That you'll be a neurosurgeon? Wake up, kid! Don't be dumb! Don't waste this opportunity. I never missed on anything in life because of women. Your professional fulfillment is what makes your relationship a happy one. Listen to me! Take a look at your happy relationship. Mario, it's Luana. Júpiter's at my front gate. He's making a scene. He's drunk again. My dad's almost home, and I'm so scared of what he might do to him! You have to come get him now! JÚPITER, SWEETHEART! HOW I'VE MISSED YOU! SAME HERE Who are you texting, Júpiter? My godmother. TELL ME YOUR NEWS Luana? ALL GOOD Your father called here again last night. SAME OLD Let him sweat a little longer FOUND A LOVELY PHOTO OF YOUR MOM I'll call him later. Sweetie, will you meet me in the square later? Teresa, thanks. - You're welcome. - Bye, Mario. Bye. I'll walk Luana to the door. What about this? THE SUPPOSED FATHER, MR. MÁRIO MUNIZ SANT'ANNA, IS NOT JÚPITER SEIXAS' BIOLOGICAL FATHER. Translation by: Fernando Arraiza
