Well, Aubert -- how are you? Still limping a bit. I just wanted to say goodbye, Mr. Gilles, and thank you. - Thank me? - It would have been dreary without you. Are they your parents? Yes. May I? My father ... my mother. - And that's you? - Yes. - You were never parted. - Never. This evening I'll go alone to find the little hotel ... ... where we three would have stayed. Will you stay in the business? I could, but ... alone? There, we've arrived. Gilles! This is it. - Captain, thank you. This trip -- - Don't worry about it. It'll all work out. Now you'll have a family -- A family? An uncle I never knew ... ... and a maternal aunt, who hated music hall artistes. - You should still see them. - Of course I will, captain. Good luck, Gilles. - Mr. Babin? - What? Laduret is asking about the bills of lading. Tell him that's his lookout -- have them ready by tomorrow noon. Captain! - How are you? - Just in from Trondheim. I'm going to see Mr. Plantel. You won't find him -- he's in Paris. Have a drink? You think Mr. Plantel will be back tomorrow? Of course, it's All Saints' Day. - How was the crossing? - Fine, a little fog over the Channel. I saw you landing a passenger. - Stowaway? - Yes, a Frenchman. Gilles Mauvoisin. His parents had just died in Trondheim and he had no money. I took him on. - Captain? - A port. They were music hall artistes, died asphyxiated by a hotel stove. He said he had a relative here. Yes, an aunt -- the widow Eloi. She has that shop by the waterfront -- shipboard supplies. Yes? No! Absolutely not! No more from me! You'll get nothing! You're just mountebanks! Mountebanks! Mountebanks ... Mountebanks ... Anyone here? - Have you any rooms, Madame? - What a funny hat! Yes, it comes from Norway. You want a room for tonight, or by the day? For tonight, and maybe a few days more. And a room you shall have, my dear. Why, you're freezing! Let me give you a pick-me-up. You sit yourself right down! And you'll dine here tonight. Will herrings do? - Oh, yes! - Do you have family in town? - Do they know you're here? - No, I don't know them yet. - Want me to send someone? - No, thanks. - Hello, Jaja! - Hello there. - What'll it be? - A Calvados. Say, have you seen Le Kelven today? Of course not! The May Rose cast off last night. Oh, right. - If you should see Le Kelven ... - He's gone, I said! Oh, right. - Jaja ... if you see Le Kelven ... - I know! Tell him you're tired! You'll have a slice of p?t? to start. Mme Eloi says her nephew still hasn't showed up. I wonder why the boy didn't go to his aunt's ... - Mme Eloi asked if you knew anything. - No more than she! Emile, telephone all the hotels in town. Ask if they've got a tall young man, name of Gilles Mauvoisin. - Where'd you pick him up? - Cemetery. I knew he'd be there. Glad to meet you, young man! Raoul Babin, a friend of your uncle. He may have mentioned me in his letters. My uncle never wrote to us. Octave Mauvoisin was no sentimentalist, it's true. But he was quite a man! Foul-tempered, but a will of steel! And instinct! Daring! - What did my uncle do? - Business, big business. And he knew it inside out. Business was his whole life. Nothing else counted for him. Sociable as a bear, he was. Do come in, Mr. Jean. Ah, it's you ... Jean Plantel, the son of Plantel the shipowner. - Gilles Mauvoisin, just in from Norway. - Delighted. A pity Father's away. He's far too respectable to be seen in a loose woman's home. Come now, Raoul! I was just speaking of Octave Mauvoisin. - Was my uncle married? - Yes. He didn't get along with his wife. This and that. I hope we'll meet again. My parents would be delighted to welcome you -- we're family! Thank you. Gilles Mauvoisin has relatives, an aunt, cousins ... We were waiting for you, Mr. Hervineau. Mr. Hervineau, your uncle's solicitor. Mr. Mauvoisin, very glad to meet you. - You'd given up on him! - Our meeting is all the more pleasant. What do you think of our little town? I haven't been here long. It's a town, what do you want? In any event, Mr. Mauvoisin won't be lonely. Indeed! You'll find yourself surrounded by friends. A new recruit for bridge -- my wife will be thrilled! Mr. Hervineau can't monopolize you! Hands off! Don't I deserve it, after the trouble this young man gave me! I didn't know. After your uncle died, I advertised in newspapers all over the world. You advertised? Didn't Mr. Babin tell you? That was your business. Then I'm delighted to be the first to tell you. Your uncle, whose fortune was immense, made you his sole heir. Nice surprise, eh? As we're here, why not fix a date to read the the will in my office? Gilles Mauvoisin inherits the entire estate of the late Octave Mauvoisin ... ... subject to certain conditions. He must reside in the house on the quai des Ursulines. He must accept that the widow Mauvoisin also reside there ... ... and pay for her maintenance. Until his legal majority, the legatee's guardian will be Mr. Plantel ... ... and adjoint guardian his aunt, Mme. Eloi. Do you accept? I am honored by Octave Mouret's choice. Guardianship can add nothing to my affection for Gilles -- but I accept. According to the will, I must now, in the presence of you all ... ... give Gilles Mauvoisin a certain sealed envelope. It contains the key to the private safe in Octave Mauvoisin's bedroom. The late Mauvoisin clearly specified ... ... that the safe must in no event be broken into. You may not open it until you have discovered the combination. Pardon me -- do you know what is in this safe? No, no ... but, if I understood your uncle correctly ... ... papers of a rather delicate nature. I must ask you to sign ... ... Mr. Gilles Mauvoisin. And Mr. Plantel. Mme. G?rardine Eloi. Thank you. Congratulations, young man! I know you will live up to your uncle's expectations. He was a friend to all of us. I'm glad for you, dear Gilles, and I hope to see you often. When my son Bob is back from Paris, you'll be great friends. You'll see, he's a dear boy. To be both young and rich -- there's no greater luck in life! I can seldom perform my duties with such pleasure! Jean is waiting for you downstairs -- you have business with him. - Don't forget, our house is yours! - See you soon! Well ... What do you think of the heir? He doesn't seem to realize what's happened to him. - I wasn't expecting such a dunce. - All the better. With that safe, Octave Mauvoisin tried to spoil our pleasure in his death. But he didn't know his nephew. That young ass won't ever be able to open the safe. I don't think he'll even want to. The widow Mauvoisin might well suggest it to him. I'm sure she's working up to it already. Plantel, since you'll handle his money and run his businesses ... ... remember the situation Octave Mauvoisin left me in. G?rardine, I understand you want to get your business settled ... ... but don't rush things. - You can talk! - We're almost all in your situation. Mauvoisin forced us to give him a share in our businesses ... ... but, I repeat, don't rush things. Lovely! The same people always come out on top! My dear, I must do my duty as a guardian. Oh no -- don't give us that, Plantel, not you! - G?rardine is absolutely right. - We know how you work. - I forbid you -- - Oh, please. Don't bicker. Here's what we'll do. Each of us will draw up a list of our requirements. At our next meeting, we'll see when and how we can straighten things out. There. For a ready-made overcoat, it fits you well, no? - I don't know much about clothes ... - You'll learn! Well now! Look who just pulled up. - Dr. Sauvaget. - One of my relatives? Not exactly! He's the ... let's say friend of your aunt, Colette Mauvoisin. - Are you sure? - It's been going on three years now. - Are you shocked? - No. She's an odd woman. Foreign parents, worked in the cinema -- - Actress? - Not exactly -- -- usherette. Some say she sacrificed herself, marrying your uncle -- -- for the sake of her family. I say marrying for money was her dream all along. Her mistake was getting caught with Dr. Sauvaget. Thanks, I don't smoke. Your uncle couldn't swallow that! For three years he didn't say a word to her. And the best part is -- Hang on, I'll be right back. Pardon me, just a word ... Sorry, old chap, I can't walk back with you -- -- I've got business with that girl. Not bad, eh? I'll show you some of the local talent. Don't say no! Couldn't be easier! A ride in your car and you're in! You're only out the cost of gas! You really won't? ... very well, just take the street to your left. You can't miss the canal. I've had your baggage sent over. Goodbye! Mme. Rinquet, after you. Excuse me. This is Mme. Mauvoisin's room. This was your uncle's room. Gilles, if you want to use that woman's room -- -- don't hesitate, it's within your right. - Is this portrait my uncle? - No, his father. They looked much alike. You see, everything needs to be done over. It's an old house. It was a count's -- your uncle worked for him early on. - As what? - As chauffeur. And here's the famous safe to which the solicitor gave you the key. One of Mauvoisin's mystifications -- for it's empty, beyond a doubt. Gilles, are you sure I can't give you a hand? No, thank you. I need time alone -- I'm still a little dazed by all this. Of course, I understand. And it's getting late, I should go. Oh! You can't imagine how it pains me to leave you alone with ... - Keep your distance! - Of course, don't worry. Goodbye, then, Gilles. Get some rest. At what time will you have dinner served? - When do you usually serve it? - 7:30. - Serve it as usual. - Very well, sir. Good evening ... Aunt. Aunt ... I'd like to ask that nothing be changed in the house because of me. Thank you, but the house is large enough that except for meals ... ... we needn't know the other is there. Good evening. The key to the safe! Mr. Lepart, our accountant. Mr. Mauvoisin. As I was saying, today's Thursday: the first bus left at 6:00 for Belmont. With the fair, there's traffic and stops take longer. There's Mr. Babin. - Hello, Poinot. - Mr. Babin. You're up with the lark, Mr. Mauvoisin. - I wanted to get to know the garage. - Why bother? The buses are just a side business, as your uncle would say, but complex ... ... and that's why Mr. Plantel asked me to take care of them for you. - Do you really want to get involved? - Yes, I do. Poinot, have you doubled the service for the Belmont fair? - I took a bus off the St-Herblain line. - Fine. That line runs at a loss, so we don't hesitate to cut service. - And the passengers? - Let them yell. I suppose we have responsibilities? Responsibilities ... what matters is that the townships keep subsidizing us. I don't feel the same way at all, Mr. Babin. We'll discuss it later. I have some urgent business. - Certainly. - Mr. Babin. - Dr. Sauvaget expects you? - No, but I'll wait. - Fine with me. - Lucie! - Keep your hair on! ... Go in. - Who just came in? - How should I know? - I told you to get the name! - It's a patient, not the pope! - You shoved me! - I'm in a hurry -- and I didn't. - That's too much! - Oh, la, la ... Next. Please be seated, Mr. ... I'm sorry to bother you ... ... but please give me back the key. I'm sorry, my wife often listens ... Please sit down. But I don't have the key, I swear it. - I don't know why you think -- - But you know what key I mean? That is ... I suppose you mean the key to the safe. You didn't try to lay hands on it last night? On the contrary, I tried to dissuade your aunt Colette from taking it. I'm not interested in assigning responsibility. - I just want the key returned. - It will be, tonight. But I want you to know we made no attempt on you or your fortune. I don't know what those people have said about me -- - What people? - The Syndicate. Plantel! Hervineau! Babin! P?nourateau, who runs the newspaper! And others. - You call them "The Syndicate"? - It's a name they've been given -- But you're not from here, you can't understand how evil -- Very well, sir, I'll write you a prescription. There. You'll feel better by this evening. Good day! Who's the man who just left? What can I say? His name's Etienne Beaupr?, he has stomach troubles. You talked about a key. Don't deny it, Maurice, I heard you. - You're plotting. - What do you think I'm plotting? You're plotting with him, as with all the others. You're all against me. - Calm yourself, Henriette. - The maid spies, patients, all of you! Yesterday I saw three men waiting. The tallest had a torturer's pincers ... Now, it's about a key ... I can't stand it! Tell me the truth, once and for all! Of course, but rest now. Hey! You're Gilles, aren't you? I'm your cousin Bob. Aunt G?rardine often speaks of you. My mother? She doesn't even know I'm back. I stopped by to talk to my pals. They told me who you were. I'm not big on family ties. And you're not at all like your uncle. Not at all! - So they say. - But, between ourselves -- -- it's no loss to you or anyone else! Come on in, I'll introduce you to the boys. They're a wise bunch. Thanks, but another time -- I have something to do. I won't insist. See you! Yes, his first visit to the garage showed he meant to have his way. He's more than we bargained for. I don't know about that. - We're in a position to rein him in. - If we keep our eyes open. - I wonder what he'll do. - What he'll do? Nineteen years old, brought up by music hall hams, half-starved ... All he wants is to enjoy his money and have a good time. Plantel, you think all young men are like your idiot son. You're too kind. I just don't think that little Mauvoisin has the makings of a businessman. His aunt Colette's the greater danger. If you leave her in peace, she'll have no reason to act against us. What did I tell you? - Why are you laughing? - I was thinking of your fur hat. - I'd come from Norway. - To think you're Mauvoisin's nephew! How do you know? Papa -- he's the accountant in your uncle's garage. You'll be his boss now! How funny! - What's your name? - Alice. You know, I'm through with Georges. - Georges? - You remember -- you saw us from the boat. - Was it sad to break up? - We weren't serious. - I'd like to see you again. - Why not, nothing easier! Hello! - Hello, Mr. Bob! Good trip? - I did 120 km an hour. I ran over ... either a dog or a pig. - My little Bob! Here already! - Hello, Ma ... - How fast you came! - 120! -- I even stopped at the caf?. - Don't you want to rest a little? - I'm fresh as a daisy! I saw him -- the heir! What a dolt! He looks like the village idiot. - Oh, now ... - A nice little boy. With him, we'll be able to put a bit by. Lord knows I could use it. - But ... what about the money I sent? - Gone with the wind! Life in Paris is ruinous -- the minute you go out at night ... - But, dear, you know our situation -- - These things always work out! Yes ... As for Gilles, do be careful. - He's our principal creditor now -- - I'll take care of him! - Don't bother him! - Don't worry! I need a drink ... - Hello, Aunt. - Hello, Gilles. No questions for me? But there are things you should know. No indeed. No, Gilles. I must explain why I took that key. You must have had reasons -- personal ones. If I didn't have to fight the Syndicate, I wouldn't have done it. The Syndicate, you say? - The doctor spoke of it, but only just. - That's right, you don't know ... Don't think it's a secret society -- anyone in town could tell you. I got that much. At the head of every big business around here -- -- there's a dozen people who mean to keep the profits to themselves. And they manage to do so! - Plantel. Hervineau. Babin. - Yes. My uncle. My husband became the master of them all. He had compromising documents on all of them. - And those documents are in the safe. - Yes. But you -- has the Syndicate hurt you? They hate me. My marriage -- I was an usherette, he was the biggest man in town. That would do it. They didn't let me forget it. Then they wanted me to help them against my husband. After all, he and I lived together like two enemies. But what could they do against you? - Madame, it's Dr. Sauvaget. - Excuse me. - He wants to see Mr. Gilles too. - Bring him in. Pardon this intrusion -- I wanted to explain to Mr. Mauvoisin in person. Yes, Gilles. So far, it's the doctor who's been targeted by the Syndicate. And successfully. They've alienated my well-to-do patients and gotten me fired from the hospital. You have no way to defend yourself? We would have to give some guarantee of good will. - That might be wisest. - Please, let's not go over that again. The whole family. Aunt, you surprise me -- I've just learned, Madame, that Gilles visited the doctor. That's why I'm here. If you're his mistress, that's your business. But Gilles is my nephew, and I won't let you involve this child in your infamy. As for you, sir, your place is not here. Stay, doctor. You're too young to understand the role you're being made to play. You've been warned, Madame. Goodbye, Gilles. I'm ashamed. Please accept my apology. - I agree with Babin: he's dangerous. - Don't be ridiculous. - A brusque phone call and he's an ogre. - You exaggerate! - We know who we're dealing with. - I'm his tutor, am I not? - He won't put a spoke in our wheels. - For me, the only attitude to take -- Have him come up. Would you go into the next room, please? Dear Gilles, welcome! Do sit down. - A cigarette? - Thanks, I don't smoke. - And very wisely! Your visit makes me very happy --- I hope you'll return often. Well now! I'd like the files for all businesses in which my uncle was involved. - Really? The files? - Yes. I'm here to ... - To what? - To take them. I'd be glad to walk you through them, my boy. Come to see me from time to time -- often, even! We'll chat, I'll bring you up to date -- without the boring details. Don't waste your time with paperwork! I was just filing all this away. You can't just jump into the business world. It takes knowledge of affairs and men -- it's not a young man's game! I'm sorry, my mind's made up. Absurdly, my young friend! I can't make you out. You're nineteen, you're rich ... ... you can indulge your every fancy. And instead ... it doesn't make sense! When I was your age, how passionately I explored life! The mistresses of our youth ... our most beautiful memories! Mr. Plantel, I won't take up any more of your time. Very well. I can but consider your action a sign of mistrust, even hostility. And not your idea. A woman's behind it, eh? Not in the least. In any case, Mr. Mauvoisin, don't become her cat's paw. Sir. Goodbye, Mr. Mauvoisin. - Were you waiting long? - It doesn't matter! Let's go to the community hall -- some friends are doing Tino Rossi songs. - I'd rather take a walk -- do you mind? - No, just an idea! - Alice! ... May I call you Alice? - Of course! - Let's see each other often. - Every night! My work ends at 6:00. Sunday, though, I go out with my family. Your father will be reviewing files at my house, evenings. - We could see each other there! - Just what I was thinking. Would Mr. Lepart mind? Why? We wouldn't bother him. Ooh, we could have tea together! Certainly. Germaine! - Maman hasn't come up? - She will soon. - Quick, put this away. - Is Bob here? - No, I haven't seen him. - Oh, you're here. - I've been waiting for dinner. Your sister said ... Amande! - Did you go out? - I was here, reading. You just got in. Don't lie, your shoes are all muddy. I'm not fourteen years old! You were with him. I don't need to guess, everyone tells me. Your family can be proud of you. Your brother won't dare show his face. My sister shames me. I hang my head before my friends. - Do I get into your business? - My mother needn't blush for me. When you're brought back dead drunk, like last night, does that do us honor? Bob is a man. He has the right to amuse himself with his friends. Your father, a respected man, sometimes had to be escorted home. Oh, enough! I don't need lessons from a married man's mistress! - Shut up, Bob! - You two are birds of a feather! Mother has her cross to bear with daughters like you! One wasting her youth on a married man, the other too ugly to marry! She needn't worry about her daughters ... ... if she weren't ruined paying for your wine, women, and cars -- and worse! I know what you're capable of -- I know, you hear! - You want a slap? - His expenses don't concern you. Or your sister. I take care of them myself. Suppertime, children. Speaking of love ... I saw dear cousin Gilles. - Did you speak to him? - He was too busy with his little Alice. - That little schemer. - He's hooked -- with her every evening. She even goes to his place. Mr. Holier-Than-Thou isn't losing any time. But when I offered to introduce him to the girls I know ... ... he turned up his nose. - Doesn't surprise me! That Alice is an ambitious kid. Well, it's his lookout. - Since he asks nothing from anyone. - Shut up! I see you with a center parting -- and horn-rimmed glasses! - I don't need glasses. - But they're so chic! And you should carry a cane! We'll see. Here we are. That was the place. - Your grandfather? - No, my parents. My father came every day, all the way from his village ... ... to take his violin lesson from Mother's parents. Afterwards, they'd meet under the arches. Sly things -- in the dark! They were already a couple ... they spoke of the future. Father meant to be a great musician. And Mother believed in him. - I wanted piano lessons! But Father said typing would be more useful. They were failures. But even when things were worst ... we were never unhappy. Because they were always ... a couple. A real couple. Do you understand? Couples are nice. - Hello, Jaja. - Hello, sonny. You're pale! Mme. Rinquet doesn't know how to cook for you. - Jaja, rum! - Hold on! - Jaja? - What, sonny? - I'm getting married. - You don't say! Alice Lepart. Do you know her? I heard you were seeing her, but marrying ... You could have said something before. Married, at your age! - Never marry, boy! - Hey, hey ... As to your Alice ... I don't know her well ... ... but she seems like a flimsy article. I'd rather see you with someone solid, with a head on her shoulders. - But Jaja -- - A real woman! Mr. Gilles, I found what you were looking for this morning. A draft endorsed by your uncle given in payment to the Comptoir du Sud. Thank you. May Alice stay to dinner? I'll bring her home in good time. - Of course, Mr. Gilles. - Please, just Gilles. - Still working at it? - My poor Gilles, I'm hopeless. Don't be hard on yourself, Colette. With 10 million possible combinations ... ... it takes 10 years to try them all. - But if he chose a word ... ... some mental process took place in his head -- we could trace that. With a man like that ... it wouldn't be easy. - How are you doing with Mr. Lepart? - It's easier than I was led to believe. - You'll become a big businessman! - Not I! I just told my friend Jaja about the engagement. You ought to think about an engagement banquet. - Really? - People here expect it. If you don't have one, your fiancee would be hurt, and her family. Well, if it must be ... - You'll come? - You know it's impossible. Me sitting down with Aunt Eloi and the others ... I wouldn't enjoy it. Go ahead! - Did you enjoy the play, Tuesday? - Oh yes! Didn't we, Gilles? It was The Marquise's 14 Lovers! Have you seen it? ... Pity! I had to drag Gilles. I laughed so in the third act! But I prefer the movies, don't you? - My goodness ... - Of course, you were an usherette. - Madame, a phone call for you. - Excuse me. What's wrong, Gilles? Nothing. You're so quiet, like you're sulking. No. Please just let me be. Is it your aunt? It's the doctor. His wife is more and more nervous. He's worried. The poor woman! The doctor is unfortunate. - My aunt isn't in? - Yes, she'll be down. I wanted to see you to discuss some business. I'm listening. I hate to put the bite on, but I'm in a real fix. Some idiot got in front of my car, he's in the hospital, and ... If I can't have 20 thousand francs right away, it goes to court. Bob, a month ago I gave you 5 thousand. It was a debt of honor! - Two weeks later, 10. Now it's 20. - I could squeeze by with 10 -- Hello, Gilles! Lovely to see you, you visit us so seldom! I've come to announce my engagement. May one know to whom? Alice Lepart, the daughter of one of my employees. If I may, I'll bring her here Thursday. Congratulations. I suppose you've made your inquiries? I won't give you my opinion, as you haven't asked it. I'd like to invite you, Bob, and my cousins to the engagement banquet. If it's to be at your house, I refuse ... ... to associate with Mauvoisin's widow. - Never! It should be held at my house. I'm your mother's sister. It will be in a restaurant. If you wish. Your aunt Colette must be frantic. Why? Dr. Sauvaget's wife died the day before yesterday. - I heard. - And since then, strange complications! - Goodbye, Gilles. - Goodbye, Aunt. Gilles! I was waiting for you. - Colette, what's wrong? - It's dreadful -- - They refused to bury the body. - What? - The doctor is under house arrest. - They suspect him? - Of poisoning his wife. - Impossible! The day before she died, she spoke to a friend, accusing her husband. Mme. Rinquet's brother is on the force. He warned us. - But she was hopelessly neurotic! - I believe it was suicide. - You mustn't worry. - But he -- he must be frantic! I can't even go see him. I'll do it. Wait for me in the caf? by the courthouse. Hey, Desrosi?res! Your Sauvaget article is all wrong. Take off the kid gloves! - Dig in, man! - I thought ... - Don't think! You begin, "A sad event troubles our peaceful town" -- it's dull, weak! Put "A hideous crime whose vileness is matched only by its savagery" -- see? "Doctor X" -- are you kidding me? He has a name! It's Sauvaget, hear me? Sauvaget. And why say his wife was neurasthenic, you donkey? She was, despite painful infirmities, an admirable woman, blablabla ... - I might hint at his mistress ... - Hint? It's the heart of the matter! Give me something on this usherette ... ... from god knows where, who got a millionnaire to marry her ... ... then made herself a byword ... - I'm on it. And don't forget Sauvaget was fired from the hospital for negligence! Possibly criminal negligence! Mr. Mauvoisin, I'm Rinquet, the brother. You're going to see Dr. Sauvaget? Don't bother, he's been taken in. The autopsy showed poison. - But he's innocent! - Some of us think so too ... ... not counting those afraid to speak up. Do you know to whom Mme. Sauvaget accused her husband? Name of Narguet, wife of a solicitor's clerk. - What solicitor? - Hervineau. - Thank you, Mr. Rinquet. Any news -- - I'll tell my sister. This accusation won't stand. You don't know how far their hate and determination can go. I know them, and I despair. Colette, you mustn't! Gilles! I told Roberte we'd pick her up. Don't dawdle, the banquet's at noon. - We've got time. - That's what you always say. Get your paper! Sauvaget case! Will Octave Mauvoisin be exhumed? - Do you hawk the paper here often? - I do what I'm told. If you have a complaint, talk to the newspaper director. Get your paper! New development in Sauvaget case! "New development in Sauvaget case ..." "Was Octave Mauvoisin poisoned?" "A strangely sudden death." "Will Octave Mauvoisin be exhumed?" Gosh ... Come on! You didn't invite the Maillards. I did ask you to. I'm sorry, I must have forgotten. It's your misfortune -- this is no time to make enemies. Do you really believe my uncle was poisoned? What can I say? I know you're on her side. Your uncle was strong as an ox but faded away in a few months. It's only logical. The lovers get rid of the husband first, then the wife. I don't believe a word. Naturally. If they exhume your uncle ... ... we'll see what we will see. Did you see? Mines are down 16. And the maneuvering began this morning. - It was at 96 in Paris. - It hadn't budged in Anvers. - I can read the signs. - A classic coup. - Swings and roundabouts. - Look at this dreary bunch. - You'd think it was a funeral. - Or an exhumation. My cousin's witty today. I think we can get up. You didn't expect me to make a speech? Delightful gathering. What a triumph for the Syndicate to ruin two kids' celebration. - Hats off to P?nourateau and his rag. - Don't cry, Babin, you'll look drunk. Throwing mud, rabble rousing ... - I don't like it. - What chivalry! Fortunately, it doesn't touch your pocketbook. Plantel, you disgust me. You've got a slap coming to you. Now, now, my dear Babin! Do understand, this is just a way to put pressure on you know who. - There were 56 guests, sir. - Perfect. Thank you, sir. Congratulations again, Gilles! And a word of warning. You run your businesses, you get engaged without consulting me -- very well! As for your attitude towards Colette Mauvoisin ... ... demonstrating any misplaced sympathy would be scandalous, believe me. - Is service included? - Yes, sir. Was everything satisfactory? - Indeed. Don't forget, your aunt G?rardine and I are your legal guardians. - That's all I have to say. - It's completely useless. Very well. Gilles, when you have nothing better to do, stop by for a chat. I'm always at Armandine's in the evening. Gilles, Mama feels sick. It's the champagne. - Goodbye, Mr. Babin. - Goodbye, Gilles. Now it's more than an insinuation. The newspaper accuses me directly. What gives them the right -- My poor boy, the right! ... Come in. The police has just gotten a call from Paris. Traces of arsenic were found in your uncle's body. The anonymous letter we got Monday was correct. It's impossible! Don't believe it, Mr. Rinquet! I'm sorry, it's beyond a doubt. So my uncle was poisoned. Someone poisoned him. And that someone can only be me. - That's what you think, Gilles. - I said nothing of the sort. If a friend won't give me the benefit of the doubt ... ... what can I expect from a judge? I'm not accusing anyone, I just want to know the truth! Gilles, it wasn't me! I had nothing to do with this crime! No, I'm sure it's not you. You believe me? Colette, I'm sorry. I was stupid. But I was so confused. Forgive me? No need, Gilles. Appearances are so against me. I know how the household runs -- -- you couldn't have poisoned him without my sister helping. Suspect my sister? Never! But try telling the judge! And the Sauvaget case on top of it ... What should we do? - The smart thing would be to get the Syndicate on your side. - No! They'd make you pay too dearly. - No, we must find the killer. - Find the killer! Listen, Mr. Rinquet, your sister said you'd be retiring in a few months. - Suppose you resigned now? - I wouldn't mind. You could help me find the truth -- I'd pay, of course. It wouldn't be much -- I just hope your money won't be wasted. Ah, it's you. I think you were wise to come. - Let us talk alone, would you? - I won't say goodnight! Sit down, Mauvoisin. So, what do you want? Information or advice? I want to know what the Syndicate means to do about this poisoning business. Believe it or not, the other members of the Syndicate, as you call it ... ... haven't told me their intentions. What I can tell you is that they'll create difficulties for you ... ... and Colette Mauvoisin, unless you fall in line. - I won't be manipulated. - Don't be a fool. - I believe I'm reasonable. - No, Mr. Mauvoisin, you're not. One thing you must know: you're not the man your uncle was. - Possibly, but -- - Your uncle was a man like me -- -- a man who bent others to his will. He began as a chauffeur, I as a longshoreman. So to get where we got -- we couldn't be choirboys. But you, Gilles ... You're not that kind. You're your father's kind. Not your uncle's. You're the kind that takes it in the kisser. I'm sorry to say it ... You're one of the sheep ... What is it, Gilles -- don't you feel well? I hear you, Mr. Babin ... ... but if I'm a sheep, I'm a stubborn one! Gilles, I like you. A boy of your age, in your position, standing up for himself -- I like that! Just for that, I'd like to see you win out. But it's impossible. - We'll see! - There's nothing to be done. This arsenic business ... I'm not the one who'll profit most. But if there's a carcase to be devoured, I won't be left out. That carcase, Gilles, might be you. - I'd be sorry. - Thanks. Ah ... Plantel, Hervineau, all that lot ... They've been rich for three generations and they're scared for their fortunes. They're not my kind either. Their dirty business disgusts me. I can't stop them ganging up on you. And I'll put in with them. I won't be done out of my share. So what should I do? Go to Plantel. Tell him you mean to travel. Let him run your businesses. It's the best way to calm their rage against your aunt Colette and ... ... the only way to save your fortune. - Is my fortune in danger? For God's sake, the buses alone ... If I wanted to take the trouble, I could cut their value by two-thirds. He came well-equipped. Unfortunately, I only saw him from the back. It doesn't matter, they wouldn't have hired a local. - What happened? - They tried to force the safe. Unsuccessfully. The thief was interrupted. I came home earlier than expected. That phone call you got -- it was to get you out of the house. Two minutes later, I was called to go on site for a supposed accident. I'm sure Plantel was behind it. He would have gotten the compromising documents -- -- and accused you of forcing the safe! - Nice work. - I'll go to the police! I wouldn't advise that. Don't go against Plantel without proof. By the way, I have resigned. I'm free as of tonight. Fine! Tomorrow morning we'll begin our investigation. Mr. Plantel, I'm returning your colleague's equipment. You shouldn't have gone to such trouble. Cigarette? That's right, you don't smoke. You don't look well. Tired? You look thinner ... nervous. - You should see someone. - Never mind me. Just because Dr. Sauvaget is in prison, don't neglect your health! I neglect nothing, not even your advice. I'm glad you acknowledge my concern. And how is the charming Mme. Mauvoisin? Like a woman with nothing on her conscience. Really? I don't know if you've seen ... ... that the local papers have an active campaign ... ... against soft-hearted juries. Almost an order. You'll see -- they'll have her head. You'll see! Despite you and your papers, the truth will out! We make the truth. The problem with Mme Mauvoisin's case -- -- is that her husband was over fifty. Jurors are men of a certain age. They can excuse -- -- slaughter between young marrieds -- but a man of fifty! That's quite different! That, and the aforementioned press campaign ... Why are you all attacking her? What a sad end for a lovely young woman! - Verdict, prison, then ... - Mr. Plantel, what are your conditions? You yield? Give me back the files and let me run your businesses myself. You accept? Yes? Good. One more thing -- Have your aunt Colette come see me some afternoon. - Tomorrow, for example. - You're a swine. You know, I've heard that before. - You think you've a strong hand. - Yes. - The game isn't over. Listen, Mr. Mauvoisin ... -- in a few days you'll come crawling to me. -- and even if you come too late, I'll receive you with pleasure. Every morning at 7:00, your uncle was there. He looked at yesterday's accounts. He said nothing. But if something displeased him, he took a red pencil and made a note. Mr. Lepart told me he was always afraid to find a red note when he came in. We're following your uncle's schedule minute for minute. He almost never varied -- that's why we can reconstitute it. At the port, his first visit was to his tug: he'd named it La Bonne Marie. Then he looked over the docks. He had shares in three quarters of the fishing boats. He looked over their haul and prices, afraid they'd cheat him. Then he went back to town. He went slowly; he had lots to see. Everything around him was his in part. His interest lay everywhere. Many people hated him and wished him dead. 9:00 sharp, Cafe de la Mairie. Always stopping at the inscription -- you see there's a letter missing. "Marie" instead of "Mairie" -- that seemed to amuse him. What are you doing here at this hour? Come have a drink -- you're blue with cold! Is it true Rinquet's working for you? Yes -- I want the truth about my uncle's death. And you think that big lummox can find it? - Sonny, there are too many people -- - Jaja -- I want to get to the bottom of this. - What would my uncle say, mornings? - Not a thing. He'd sit in that corner -- a habit since his chauffeur days. Did he drink alone? Alone. - Hey, Jaja! - Coming! - How much? - Three francs. Hey, sonny! Have a drink? Don't be shy. Every morning, I served your uncle his white wine and Vichy. If I'd wanted to, I could have poisoned him! 11:00, the Bar Lorrain. A glass of port with Babin. Three glasses, even, while they discussed business. If there were arsenic in port, would it taste different? 5:00 in the evening, he'd stop by Mme. Eloi's. There, too, he was the master. He went to the counter. Loudly he asked Mme. Eloi how her rotten son was. Hat still on his head ... ... he reviewed the accounts, read the letters and bills. Then he went to the glassed-in office, where he had his tea served. Every day at the same time, the maid brought it. He took two cups of weak tea and dry toast. I'm late. - Gilles, you must be exhausted. - I walked a bit, that's all. What trouble you take for me. You could be so peaceful ... ... without me! - Without you! What would my life have been, in this house, without you? What will it be ... later? Have you seen your lawyer? Yes. He expects I'll be charged. He has great hopes for your investigation. So far, I've got nothing. It's dizzying how my uncle moved about. He went everywhere: warehouses, worksites, the bank ... ... shops, markets, I don't know! He moved among hundreds of businessmen, workers, debtors. He was feared, hated. This went on for twenty years. Until someone in that crowd decided to do away with him. Someone. Beer. - Why shouldn't I? - Sit down, Bob. - Think I'll back down? - Oh, no! Bob! Is it still going on? Answer me! Pretty tough, for a poisoner's boyfriend! You scum! Get back, dirtbag. And watch yourself. You should have listened to me. You're fair game for any punk. Thank you for intervening. - But may I ask you something? - Go on. Did you know Plantel tried to force my uncle's safe? - What? - Just as I thought -- you didn't. Here's the taxi. Thank you -- I'll go there alone. It was the day before yesterday, around 5:30. Plantel, we need to talk. What is it? You tried to burgle Mauvoisin's safe. Considering its contents,"burgle" is rather harsh. You associated me with your dirty tricks. I'm no thief. I acted on my own, but in the interest of all of us. You planned to keep the documents and blackmail the rest of us. - Nothing authorizes you to believe -- - You're scum, Plantel. I won't be associated with theft. Count me out of the Syndicate. Stop and consider -- if you leave, you become our enemy. The investigating magistrate has sent me to bring you to the courthouse. If they sent you in person, Inspector, this must be an arrest. I may say nothing. - Should I bring a suitcase? - That would be prudent. Mme. Rinquet! I've been arrested. Please bring me the suitcase I packed. Where can I reach Mr. Gilles? He went to his uncle's village. He's bound to hear about it in any case. - They can't hold you long! - I don't know. Tell Gilles -- no, don't say anything. There's contradiction on another point ... In the three years you knew each other, you could have made plans. Mme. Mauvoisin stated ... ... that you often spoke of what you might do, if free of conjugal ties. You'd even decided to settle in another town, correct? Yes, your honor, that's correct. But Dr. Sauvaget, to whom I put the same question yesterday ... ... states he made no such plans. He said your relationship -- acquaintance, rather -- was casual. Your honor -- I have your statement in front of me. Is this a defense tactic? I made no future plans -- In short, you confirm your statement. I regret this investigation forces me to rend your illusions, Madame. I heard you were investigating with a policeman. I wanted to see the village where my father was born, that's all. - I heard my uncle came here for lunch every Thursday. - Sure did! I wondered what he thought, what he said ... We never met. It would help me know him. What can I tell you? He sat there -- he wasn't a talker. He would be dreaming, like. Grandma, is he going away? Hush or you'll get a hiding! - This young woman is ... ? - My mother. - And the other? - My sister Marie. Your uncle's mother. He promised to put us in his will, but we never saw the color of his money. Marie! Don't worry, they're sure to release her. Come in. I found the word. Marie, his mother's name. His one tender feeling was for her. Remember the tugboat he had renamed La Bonne Marie? When I saw that on her tomb, I knew I'd found the word. Let's hope it's not too late. - You've heard, of course? - Yes. I'd like you to look at the Eloi file. Oh, yes, the three false drafts that your cousin Bob ... ... signed in your uncle's name. The police were aware of them. Pardon me for not mentioning them before -- I hadn't the right. I, Robert Eloi, acknowledge putting in circulation ... ... three 10,000 franc drafts, stolen from my uncle's Mauvoisin's desk ... ... and signed with his name. - See the date? Two months before your uncle's death. But I already looked into that. Your cousin was out of town for the two months before the death. All the better. I'm relieved. But look at the Plantel file. Ah, hello, my dear Gilles. So, the very day your dear friend was torn from you, you are reduced ... ... having ignored my advice, to implore me, your humble servant ... Mr. Plantel, I'm here to tell you my uncle's safe is open. Congratulations. Listen, Gilles ... I must apologize ... I can be short-tempered ... ... and I often say more than I mean. Mr. Plantel, you're a thief. And a murderer. You have on your conscience the death of four sailors ... ... in your ship's insurance fraud. - Silence! Not only did you avoid prison -- you tried to send innocents there. - I'm fully prepared to rectify -- - High time. What can you do for Mme. Mauvoisin? I'll use all my influence -- With the case under way, influence won't do much. I need the truth. Do you know who murdered my uncle? Do I ... ? How could I? You're sure? To bad for you, Mr. Plantel. Listen ... Yes. I know who killed him. Or rather ... I have my suspicions. I need more than suspicions. It was a fortnight before his death. He was already very weak. It was at the Eloi shop. He was alone, having his tea. He poured me a cup. I was dreadfully ill that night. And the doctor ... ... noted symptoms of poisoning, and even of arsenic. You didn't warn my uncle? It didn't occur to me until later. Unfortunately, by then he was dead. We'll go to the public prosecutor together. The prosecutor? You can't mean it. You have no choice, Mr. Plantel. Hello? Call Babin at the Bar Lorrain. Then Hervineau ... Then P?nourateau. It's urgent! Hey, Gilles! Congratulations! The gang is panicking! They're burning up the telephone wires! So, what are you going to do? - Me, I'm not worried. - I know, I saw your file. Statute of limitations, anyway. It happened over there. On the waterfront. 1;00 in morning. The Portuguese was out for me because of a woman. He knifed me in the belly. I cut his throat. Your file is at your disposal, Mr. Babin. No hurry. What was the word that opened the safe? Marie. His mother's name. I should have guessed. Goodbye, Gilles. He's in the small salon. Mr. Mauvoisin, forgive me. I heard the news ... ... and assure you of my devotion. - Duly noted. I also wanted to ask you ... That file ... it's painful for a man in my situation ... To be accused of theft of inheritance? Circumstances overpower us ... The niece you had committed for years, until she actually went mad ... - God called her to him last year. - Dr. Sauvaget isn't so far gone. He was arrested on the testimony of your head clerk's wife. In fact, new testimony has come to my attention. - I intended to make it public. - Once Dr. Sauvaget was beheaded. Do as you think best. When affairs have been righted, I will act accordingly. May I take my leave? - Good evening, Madame. - Good evening. Good evening, Aunt. Come in, Gilles. Sit down, Gilles. What do you have to say to me? When you've finished your playacting, tell me why you're here. You know it wasn't she who killed my uncle. So she's the one to be saved. She alone. I won't let her be condemned in your place. Have you already shown the drafts to the investigating magistrate? What are you waiting for? Well? You must do something! I don't know -- perhaps if -- Yes? Suppose you all went abroad? Naturally, I'd ... Give us the money to do so? I refuse. Accuse your cousin, accuse me. You'll need proof. I think we've said all we have to say to each other. Aunt, think it over, please. You care only for that woman. I care only for my children. I can admit it. Your children! You've sacrificed your daughters to Bob! I regret nothing I've done for him. Oh, you are -- Think of what's best for Bob. When the drafts business is known, how will he look? To his sisters? To the town? You little fool. It won't be his first scandal. Did you think this was a respectable family? No indeed. Your cousin is a wastrel, a thief, a scoundrel. And he's the dearest of my children. The one in whom I placed my hopes. Is it his fault if his youthful promise has gone rotten? Is it his fault God has abandoned him? I saw him faltering, dragged down ... Only I tried to help him. He had only me -- his mother -- -- to to preserve the illusion of his dignity. I'm sorry. I had friends, relatives. Did they help him? As he slid downwards, they laughed. And you, his cousin. You judged him at first glance ... ... and pushed him aside. I didn't understand. I killed Octave Mauvoisin. Yes, I. Day after day, I poured out the poison that would kill him. Do you think I killed for money? To avenge his tyranny over me? It was neither money nor pride. That man, strong and influential, who could have saved my son -- -- not only did he do nothing to help him -- -- he crushed him with his scorn. He rejected him, pushed him deeper in the mud. He called him trash, scum, scoundrel. He had nothing but insults and spittle for him. He committed the first crime. A crime against charity and a child's pain. Go to the magistrates. Tell them the widow Eloi is a monster. I'll defend myself. Aunt, believe me, I'm sorry. Mother loved you so. She remembered your girlhood. Her dream was to come back to France and embrace you. She told me often. Aunt, I'd give anything not to have to -- But Colette is innocent! I'm not leaving. There's not the slightest proof against me. A fortnight before my uncle died -- -- one of your friends took tea with him here. That night he had all the symptoms of arsenic poisoning. I see. But Plantel won't testify against me. Ask him! You were right, Gilles. Friends are no better than relatives. Why consider me an enemy? I wish you could understand ... Spare me the hearts and flowers. I might be able to help with passports. Thank you. I'll handle it. Aunt! Goodbye, Gilles. - Good night. - No, stay with us! - Come on, don't be silly! - No, no, I can't! Oh, you're no fun, Alice! Gilles! What's wrong? You're crying! My eyes are red -- just the night air. - You went out? - Yes, you see -- - Don't explain. - Are you angry? - Not at all, Alice. - You see, I met them -- - You were right to go out. My idea of a couple isn't yours, that's all. Before we met, my life was nothing like the life you have a right to. But in my heart, that life is still the one I love. But it wasn't me -- they wanted to go dancing! It doesn't matter. Good night. Good night. But, you know, Gilles ... Get your paper! Dr. Sauvaget exonerated! Suppose he had the documents photographed? That's what we'd have done! But he? He's an honest boy. Yes. Come in. - Mr. Gilles Mauvoisin. - Send him in. All correct? May I? Good evening, gentlemen. Sit down, Gilles. I'm leaving tomorrow. - So soon? - Why wait? Gilles, don't be rash. The Mauvoisin fortune. What will you do with it? If you've looked at the files ... Your uncle was no saint. You must have seen, with that mess of paper ... ... you've got your work cut out, Mr. Babin. Making reparations isn't easy. But that fortune -- you have a right to it! I'd be its prisoner. I want to be free. And your aunt Eloi? I called Counsellor Vinquet. I hope he'll defend her. Why did she turn herself in? She could have followed her children to Spain. Perhaps she thought this last sacrifice would convince Bob to reform. Let's hope. I doubt it, though. Mr. Babin! La Malice is fouling! Again? That hulk! Mr. Babin, I'll leave you now. Goodbye then, Gilles. You're right -- a man gets no peace. - Engine trouble? - And the cargo isn't balanced. Sit down. What's wrong, Gilles? I wonder. Colette, I don't want to turn into my uncle. Then what will you do? I want to go, like my father and mother ... Really? Really. It might be easier than we think to start over. In my cell ... ... I finally felt capable of achieving my dreams. Who knows? We might have met somewhere far from here. Chance isn't that easy on us. You're laughing! So I am. Gilles ... Remember our first meeting, in the dining room? I feel we're beginning my parents' life. Leaving one music hall to run to another. Where are we going? You forbade me to say. Now I want to know. I forget. Maybe our journey will never end.
