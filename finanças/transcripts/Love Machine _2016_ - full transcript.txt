She didn't resemble Eva Green in any way. When I met her, she had a pink laptop and hair extensions and I thought that Fellini was a champagne. It was clear she couldn't be my girlfriend. But at that very moment I realized ﻿that I had fallen in love with her. I threw a snowball at her, ﻿but she kept smiling as if nothing had happened. She was almost shining. She really liked everything that was happening to her. I'd never seen that before, and I thought "wow"! It was as if she came straight out of a Disney cartoon. And late I found out she was a nympho and it quickly brought us together. We both liked sex, so it took me some time to realize that we were different that we are not a good match. I just had this illusion because of the incredible sex we had. But sex is not enough, you know. And so I began to realize I couldn't be with her anymore. I'd love to but then I realized that I had to get out of this Disney cartoon. At first I started to sleep in another room, but then I took courage to tell her we were breaking up. But what's interesting, she wasn't surprised of frightened. She just smiled and said, "I don't think so." I don't think we're breaking up. I was like "Why?". and she was like - "Well, because we just can't." - "But why?" "Because we are like Twix bars, you know". We can't break up." For 18 months already I've been trying to tell Natasha that we're not together. But she just keeps smiling and saying that we're Twix bars. Sometimes I feel like I got into a documentary version of Gone Girl, but unlike with Ben Affleck, it's happening to me in real life. Natasha, did you happen to have had a lobotomy as a child? Can't you understand that I'm dating another girl now? When will you leaving my flat? That my flat, you know. Who's your new girl? Masha is my new girl. It's just another girlfriend, you've always dreamt of having sex with one of your students. - It means nothing. - What's going on? When will you leave? In a week or so. Tell me, how long is your week? - Look, I need to... - No, tell me how long? I need to find a new flat. I can't move out right now. It's uncomfortable for me to live at Masha's place. - It's been 2 weeks already. - Well, come and live here. I will when you give me my keys back and leave. I need some time to find a new place. I think that as a man you should just wait a bit. Especially, since you're in love and you're enjoying it. You don't have to be so ironic. - We feel great together. - So, how is your sex? It's fine, but... Damm, screw you! Our sex is fine, and it's not the point... We don't have sex now, because Masha is fasting. That's why we have no sex. Got it? And don't try to blackmail me with sex, ok? I am not blackmailing you, I'm just asking how's sex. I think it's a normal question. After all, we're friends now. And we have great sex, and great relationships and work. Oh, yeah, so great that I have been trying to get rid of you for almost a year. Everything is so great! I don't know what to say. I gave you money to pay the rent. I'm not driving you out. But, you see, we can't be together. It's not the blu-ray disc's fault that you can't shove its into a video recorder. It's not the blu-ray disc's fault. I adore your metaphors. They turn me on so much. Do you remember how on our way from St. Petersburg, we put up at that cool hotel in Novgorod? No, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's you who had the lobotomy then? I wish I had, but I don't know how to, what to google, and where to go to have a lobotomy, and forget about you. Do you know, what happened to me yesterday? No, tell me. I created the movie: "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? I thought it's such a great screenplay that you can go somewhere and they'll wipe off your girlfriend frpm your memory. The one who bugging you like Glenn Close in "The Fatal Attraction" Don't piss me off. You know how it ends. Natasha, just pack your stuff and move out, ok? Do it in a week or 10 days. I'll give you time. Just understand that we've broken up for real this time, ok? LOST SOULS FILMS PRESENTS A FILM BY GERALD "LOVE MACHINE" Part One: The Great Escape. Sometimes I thought it wasn't me she needed. It was him. They had their own mysterious relationship, which I know nothing about. that I'm only bothering them, that they want to get rid of me. No, she doesn't move out. No, she doesn't anything wrong she just won't move out. It's not that she's doing crazy things, no. Just ordinary crazy Natasha. She texts me "I'm bleeding to death, see you in the afterlife. And I don't know where she is. So I text back something like: "Okay, let's be together again, and go to St. Petersburg tomorrow." Just to distract and comfort her. And she isn't responding for 3 hours. - And I don't know where she is. - Maybe she's busy. What would you think if she wasn't responding for 3 hours? You would be scared and feel guilty, right? No, I just thought she'd fucking died! So, what should I do with the body, and how can I live after that? Feeling guilty is a given. You know, it's like going on a date with a black hole. You're try to tell him: "You're not my girlfriend anymore." I'm kind of a trendy guy. An art house film director. This is interesting for me. But when such a Cannes type movie comes to life, I prefer mainstream. If I tell a girl "Go away" she goes away. Guys, we're discussing an irrelevant topic. Natasha is a dead issue to me already. She doesn't bother me. Really. I am not thinking about her anymore. Hi! You aren't picking up again. I just wanted to thank you. I started watching movies from the list you left me. Yesterday I saw the great one "Harold and Maude." I liked it very much. It so believable that the granny and the boy love each other. They reminded me of us a little bit. You're the granny, of course. I'd love to watch it with you. But I didn't like "The Fatal Attraction". Why did she cook the rabbit? I don't know why you said I was like the protagonist. I'm just afraid she'd kill us because I think Natasha's gone mad. Literally gone mad. She's like Freddy Krueger. Just imagine, Freddy Krueger is slaughtering everyone and he's told: "Freddy, go to a therapist." And what will a therapist tell him? "Freddie, don't you kill people." And he's like, "Yeah, sure." and then he whacks someone again. It's useless because it's insanity and I feel sorry for her. It's called Gestalt or something like that. - What's that? - Just finish it. I never understood this word "Gestalt." Sounds like a Nazi air force unit. Something from Nazi Germany. SS, Gestapo, Gestalt. What's Gestalt? I don't get it. How can I close my Gestalt? What do you mean? OK, I'll close it. But what is it? Unlike you, I haven't studied anywhere. I'm not an educated man. Tell me, what's Gestalt? All right, let's close the topic. By the way, I think your bust is like a cool indie film. A low budget but very cool one! And huge boobs are like a $200 million blockbuster. You come to see it and all you see is the money spent on it. You've got small boobs which is like a $300,000 film. But a very good one. Some women go like, "I've got $200 million bust, that's it. I won't study, read, know stuff. I'll just be a chick with a $200 million boobs. I've got blockbusters tits." And it's sad, very sad. Sometimes I think that my brain is like big boobs. And I don't need to do anything because my brain is so cool. I don't need to educate myself, you know. I've got this illusion that I'm a chick with very big tits. Because I'm very quick and I can make up a joke right now. - Tell me "Make up a joke". - Make up a joke. - "Make up a joke about a coffee house" - About a coffee house. All right, here's is a joke about a coffee house. My friend's been working in a coffee house for 5 years. And every time before cumming on his girlfriend, he habitually asks her "For here or takeaway?" Well, it was quick at least. You know, without any doubt. The most stupid thing in art is doubt. I don't want to sit and watch a film where every shot made so accurately to make me like it. It's like a fucking escort girl: "I'm here to satisfy you!" But she keeps checking the time. I hate films that keep checking the time. "The viewer'll leave, let's cut here and there!", you know? I want to see a film with that it really has. I want to watch films with small breasts But vital, beautiful, funny. Like you. I'm sent to you to make you more unfettered What wrong with you? Were you kidnapped by the Taliban as a child? Or were you brought up among terrorists in an Afghan village? Why are you so shy? What are you ashamed of? I don't like it. That God created your soul, but devil created your ass? Why, all the best things belong to the devil? It's terrible... I want us to live to the full. I want us reading, listening music, getting laid 5 times a day. And I want you to be pregnant all the time. So that I'm like an iconic director traveling around the world with his tiny pregnant wife. And her belly is always bigger than her head. Because their sex life never stops. They'll be like "That's an iconic director Ruminov with his wife!" "How does he keep up?" And we'll have a huge black nanny with an enormous ass. She'll bring up our children, and we'll have fun and live. And the children will love us, do you know why? Because we'll never be boring. We won't bother them. I see and hear my new life's coming. You're my new life. Imagine, you're dating Gary Oldman, but he's younger. Imagine an ordinary evening with Gary Oldman. - He bit me! - Of course! It's an ordinary evening with Gary Oldman. You wake up and your ear is missing. When I was little, whenever I felt sad, me and my mom used to go to a toy store. I thought it was a planet where there was no death sadness, pain or disappointment. And now I feel sad here, even scared. It's completely reconstructed. And now it seems you're in a world where the Terminator has won. Or Darth Vader. Here are the masks of him. I'm afraid that because of all this I'll come to the dark side too. And I will lose my soul. I feel like E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial on a foreign planet. Hello, E.T. This world is scary and strange. We are all here like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. We should stick together. Don't you understand? Are you thinking about me? Do you remember the moment when I couldn't open the jar? Actually I did it on purpose because I could see I was making you laugh and I liked it very much. I like... ...to make you laugh. My mom didn't talk to me much. You know, I mostly lived at my father's house. Well, both here and there. And for some reason I don't remember my mom ever talking to me or discussing anything. And so I'm constantly looking for my mom. So be more careful with me, ok? Where am I going? Why did I agree to shoot this music video? I don't like this song. Stupid song. Of course, it's just the matter of perception, and there are no stupid songs. But I've got a feeling that this song is objectively stupid. It would be so cool to fuck her and relieve the tension. Shall I send her a picture of my dick? No, no. I won't. I'll stick to the end. This time I'll finish the story. I'll escape from her and from this fucking filmmaking. And I'll have a different life. I don't know what it'll be like, but it'll be real. Damn, I've got a boner again. As if she put microchip in my dick and now she controls me, send signals there to make me think of her all the time. Damn, I don't want to shoot this music video. I'd love to fuck her right now. But without thinking that it means something. Fuck her and then erase her memories like in "Men in Black". I'll escape from you, got it? Why are you laughing? I'm glad I came to this exhibition. It's cool to go somewhere alone from time to time. Thought it'd be great if he was with me. Serega is a great guy. It's so great that he's got his own exhibition. Lots of new works. I like people who do what makes them burn. When they achieve their goals. I like Lena. We've been discussing BDSM and "50 Shades of Gray" the whole evening. I guess she wouldn't mind a threesome. Exactly. I need to offer a threesome to her and then tell Pasha about it. He won't resist for sure. She suits his taste: creative, mysterious, young. We'll have sex with her and he'll realize that I'm the only one who understands him. Why should he lose me? In fact, he wants to be with me. It's just that his brain is deceiving him. I don't take it as offense. My mom often punished me in my childhood too. But then she was ashamed of that. I don't understand what's going on. One part of me is trying to leave another one - to stay. And who am I? I'm so sick of this damn paradoxicality of human nature. I can't get used to it. And when I finally get used to it, it'll already be time to die. So stupid... It's so ill-conceived. Damn, these are just thoughts. I need to think about something else, imagine that my thoughts are clouds or trees. These are just thoughts. Damn... I'm not these thoughts. I want something more than just to fuck her from behind. I want something more. Although it's a kind of a warm feeling. I want to fuck her the same way I wanted goalkeeper's gloves as a child. I played football and it seemed to me that if I had those gloves, I'd be the best goalkeeper in the world. Real Adidas gloves. Stop, stop. Why a Minion? Why is she wearing a Minion mask? Is my subconsciousness trying to tell me that she's so cool just like a Minion and I mistreat her? Damn, even my conscience won't leave me alone. Even though I escaped from it to the Kingdom of Masturbation and it's hard for our conscience to find us there. But damn, it's so tireless. And now it will torment me because I've shot this movie with a lot of close-ups my dick. But what's wrong with that? All directors shoot their dicks only they take forms of spaceships or armies who march into battle or a huge budget. But one way or another it's always a movie about their dick. It's not my fault they don't let me film expensive movies. They think I'm a drug addict, even though my next to last movie was awarded the prize at Kinotavr and the latest one was a commercial and did very well. So, I have to shoot what I can. Damn, who said it? Me or thi one who thinks it's bullshit? The things I just said and and even left them in the film. Damn, what's going on? I don't understand. And no one does. They're just pretending so so that they don't look like weirdos. I had a dream about this not long ago. I was walking the streets with my pet. His name was Jackie and he looked very weird. He looked like a Gremlin or a moral eel or whatever they are called. Everyone was like "What's that?" "Is it dangerous? Won't it bite us?" And I was like "No, it's Jackie, he's cool. he's harmless like a pokemon!" And everyone was like "Oh, cool!" and they took pics with him and petted him. But in fact I couldn't figure out what he was and where he came from, even though every day I fed Jackie and walked him and I couldn't get rid of him, he was always next to me. And then at some point finally realized who Jackie was. Jackie is my brain. And in fact I know nothing about it, even though every day I pretend to be its master, Jackie's master. And even though I say "Don't worry. Jackie won't bite you", I really don't know what it's going to do. I never know what my brain is up to. I don't know what Jackie's and what to expect from him. He makes his own weird decisions and I just follow them. I just do what Jackie tells me to do. I'm so tired of being responsible for it. I'm so tired of pretending I know what he is and why he made me make this movie. I feel such incredible love towards you now. It makes my mind fizzy like champagne. At these moment I feel like nothing and no one could separate us. I want to be with you. You'll be my Walt Disney and I'll be your Mickey Mouse. PART TWO: SHOWTIME You know, inside every girl there's her mom. I mean, you've met and got to like each other. She kind of ready for everything, geting undressed. And you're close to the main room in a bank. You're opening the vault and everything is happening. This is it. You've broken all the barriers. Are you're ready to do what she wants. Ready to take her. And in this very moment, it's like in these films about voices in your head. Like "The Exorcist", for example, you know this movie? About a nice girl with this voice... And just like that her mom pops up and goes, "No, I'm not ready yet! I don't even know! It's wrong!" And you think: "Oh, my God, how do I comfort her mom?" "Please, tell your mom I'm a good man." Or that I'll give her a present. Because no mom will ever allow her daughter to have more sex than she has. But actually, the best sex is the one without a dick. That's what I've understood. AND NOW! ON WITH THE SHOW Why are you driving me out? I came to visit my friends. - I'll leave soon. - Why did you come? - What's up with your eye? - It's makeup. Sexy, isn't it? Stop pretending you're a saint. - Pasha, keep your hands off her. - I'm not touching her, relax. Go lost, don't touch me. Am I a terrorist in the Tel Aviv airport? By the way, I brought you the e-book. Here. You wanted it? You got it. - That's why you came? - Yes. Done? Good girl. - And I came to see my friends. - Pasha, relax. - When are you moving out? - In a week. Were you at a Kiss biopic auditioning? What's up with your face? You look like a country-side Country love. Enough of that. You don't like it? I like it, Natasha, you're cool! Let's take a picture. - Let's take a selfie. - Selfie time! - Natasha! - Damn, something is wrong. Oh, here is the magic button. - Ready. - Well, looks nice. Do you like this guy? Do you? - Look, he's really cool. - Why are you nagging me? Let me drink the wine. I came here after the concert. - Cool guy, isn't he? - Yes, he is. Are you drunk again? Enough, I'm calling your friend Rafael. Go ahead. Hey, can you come and pick your mad friend? No! - Year, at Sasha's place. - Raf, come here! What? Did you give me the book back? What do you want? Let's just sit down together. Why are you touching me? I'm not your girlfriend anymore. Get out of my flat then! Easy. Guys... Are you wearing glasses like Ray Charles now? - To our sex... - To love. Yes. To our sex maniac. - The wine is fine by the way. - But sour a bit. Natasha, I'm pleased to meet you You are very cool. Pasha told us about you. You're missing me Before these conversations I imagined you in one way, 'cause I didn't know you before, but you are completely different. How long haven't you had sex? For a long time? Well, I don't know. Maybe I had it. - Let me finish. - I don't care. Pasha, let me finish! - What a stupid scam. - I don't think so. - And what do you think? - I think, you do care. I think, you've already thought 3 times today, and that's the limit. - Right, Natasha? - You're so witty. These are all clichés, Pasha. Clichés about blondes. Don't make a stupid parody of me! It's not like if you had been dating Steven Hawking for 3 years, you would have known how the universe functions. He wouldn't speak that much, you know. - So much information. - Who? Who exactly? Tell me. Ok, Steven Hawking. How do you know? Did you read a book about him? I watched a film. About Steven Hawking. He couldn't speak that much because at a certain point he couldn't speak at all. He became paralysed, you know. He just wasn't as much of a chatterbox as you are. No, he talked through the computer! And he pushed the buttons. I really admire you. Really, I do. - I'm neither an angel nor a monster. - I admire myself too. I'm just a human. I met Masha. You see, we are sitting together. Year, I saw you kissing when I entered. We can also post it on Instagram for you. So that you can watch it every morning. All right. - They are so cute, look at them. - Yes, we are. Though she looks more like your daughter, but why not. -At least not like your granddaughter. -Though she's your age. You don't look like my daughter because you drink so much and look like 38-year-old. - Congratulations. - No, because I'm more corpulet. You're gorgeous. You've performed well. All right, I understand now, you came after the concert. I just wanted to hang out with you. And I've brought a present. Not only the e-book. For Masha. Go ahead. In which hand? - Right? - You've guessed it. Pasha gave it to me before our trip to Tunisia. Natasha. I want you to inherit it from me. Natasha, I think it's yours. It's very beautiful, thank you. But it's yours. I don't think it's mine. Because it emanates wrong energy. Not the energy of love, you know? Things should emanate the energy of love. So I get rid of things don't emanate such energy. That's why I want to give it to you. - Take it. - Sorry, sorry. You see, violence begins. I told you. Violence begins? Fuck, Pasha, have you gone mad? - We should talk. - Hey, Pasha, don't touch her. We'll figure it out ourselves. We've been doing it for 4 years. Don't touch me! Let us talk! Don't touch Pasha! That's our private life. What are you doing? Let us talk peacefully. Come here. Why didn't you come to the concert? - Cheers! - No reason to cheering. - Raffaello, just take her away. - Rafael. What's so funny? Why are you always calling him Raffaello? Like a candy. You just got drunk. What's going on, I don't understand. He's got somewhat hysterical. - Raffaello. - Rafael. - Do you like Natasha? - Very much. So why not get more acquainted? I will when it is necessary. - What do you mean? - Well, I don't want to now. Where did she come from? Do you have any valuable information? How did you meet her? Maybe you were walking a street and then smoke suddenly appeared. And then this creature appeared from the underworld. I'm not from the underworld, I'm from heaven. From heaven? Are you sure? - You were right. - About what? - That he didn't let go. - I didn't let go? What didn't I jet go? Get off my foot. It's a mystery for me why you can't be together. Grab her ass and go to my flat from which she won't move out. I'm still live there, because I haven't found a flat. Natasha, you know, you can always move to my flat. - Get lost, both of you. - All right. I'll move into your place tomorrow. Pasha, I'll moving out tomorrow. Shall we go? Seems like he's still 16. Yeah, right. - Or maybe 18. - Maybe 18. - Damn, who are you? - I'm a ninja, come here. And I'm a werewolf and I'll tear you to pieces. We'll go soon. I'll go to the bathroom and we'll go. We'll go soon. It feels like I'm on a spaceship right now. It's like a spaceship. Take me out of here, please... I wanna to fly away, please, let me go on board. Let me go onboard... Let's fly. Please, I wannna fly away... We'll be right there soon. All right. Okay, I'm not touching you. Fasting is important. All right. We'll be there soon. Bye. We'll be there soon. Okay. Fuck. - What's happening? - What's happened with the door? It's locked from the inside. Give me a knife. - Has it ever happened before? - Never. It's stuck? I'm not a good carpenter. Oh, it's working. Hurray, I opened it! Hi. Why don't you respond to my messages? - Hi! - Hi! What are you doing in my flat? I came to visit you. Masha. Well, we can go and... Stop. Masha... - Pasha, what's going on? - I don't know. - How did she get inside? - Maybe we didn't lock the door. Why are she following you? I'm scared. One day I'm wake up and she'll cut my throat, Pasha. Calm down, of course, she won't. Pasha. - But what else can I do? - Call Rafael, he'll take her away. - Natasha. - What? If you don't leave now, I'm going to call the police. I'm calling the police. We've got all the reasons for them to arrest you. - Which reasons? - What? - I'm just a guest. - A guest. - What's on your face? - It's a star. A week has passed. And it's been on your face all this time! A fucking week has passed have you looked in the mirror? What do you want? - I texted you. - What did you text? I want to sleep with you one last time And then I'll leave you alone. Hat completes your madness. Now it's better. More mad. Give me my hat back, damn. It's Masha's hat. Natasha, it can't be like that. - It shouldn't be. - Why? Who said what's good and what's wrong? Nobody knows that. I'm with another girl now. I left. All right. Leave me, as you left your son. Fuck. - T didn't leave him! - You did. I didn't! I'm seeing him, I live nearby. I live nearby, I didn't leave him. And I wouldn't have left you, if you had calmed down I haven't left him. Don't hit me. I don't want you to hit me. I don't want to hit you. Just never talk about him again, ok? I'm asking you. I'm trying to pull myself together. Please, try to do the same. I trying to calm down. I'll call Rafael, he'll take you away. Call him. I'll call Rafael and not the police, ok? - Call him. - Don't scare Masha. She has nothing to do with it. Yes, of course. She broke into our house, damn, and is blackmailing me. She scared Masha. Come over, I'll send you the address. What's so funny? What the fuck? Did we have a saw? Masha, did you have it? Stop, stop. Don't come closer. Got it? No, I don't understand a damn anything. Masha, she got a saw. I'm turn it on, get it? And I'll cut my throat. - Is this what you want? - Calm down. My beautiful throat you used to kiss all the time. What the fuck are you doing? Cut it, dammit! Stupid girl. Did you pour the gasoline in there? Did you? My eyes hurt. It's all right. It's all right. Calm down. Thank you. Don't you know you should add fuel in it before using? - You didn't know that, babe? - I didn't. - You thought it'll work like that? - I did. Good girl. You thought you would cut your throat and then what? How would we live with it? You're a fucking egoist. Even worse than me. It's not fair. Not fair that you've left. At some point you told me that you don't need me. What if Masha isn't good for you? I'm right here, by the way. Masha, may we have for one last time? You're a bear. I've got goosebumps. We'll just sleep and that's it. Okay? Okay. Next time put the gasonline before cutting your throat. Masha is fasting, so we are not having sex. Don't try to take advantage of it. I'm just telling her, so that she knows that if she touches me and I have a boner, it has nothing to do with her. Thank you for allowing me to spend the night with you. I feel so lonely now and I don't like to sleep alone. I know that it's hard for you to sleep alone Okay, stay with us a for a while. Let's restart all, right? - Just try to accept it, ok? - Ok. Masha, if Pasha slept with me one last time, I would leave you forever. Do you want to sleep in the kitchen? We have underfloor heating there. You can sleep there. Well, I'm not a dog to sleep on the floor. Natasha, don't touch me. Think of me as your father. You wouldn't touch your father, would you? But I'm so tender and kind, I've never done anything bad to you. Apart from the fact that you came here with a star on your face and tried to cut your throat. Oh, come on, I want to sleep. Hold me. - Can you hear it? - Yes. Do you know what's that? It's my heart beating. Do you know what it's saying? Do you know the language of the heart? I do. It's saying: "I love Masha." That's why it doesn't mean anything. Even if I fucked her. Which I'm not going to do. But it wouldn't change anything, you know? - Do you hear me? - But that's what I want. I told you: fuck me, it won't change anything and I'll leave you. We'll leave this flat and go to a hotel. and leave you here. Let's not reduce it to an absurdity. It's just scary for me to sleep alone. When I was little I would run to my mom and slept with mom and dad on the couch And since then I've almost never slept alone. - I used to do the same. - You ran to your mom and dad too? I don't know how they managed to conceive my sister. I keep interrupting them. When we met, you had a pink laptop. I asked you "Do you know who Fellini is?" And she said "A champagne?" My favorite champagne is Mondoro. We aren't your biographers, ok? We're not going to write a book about you. No need to tell us all these facts. Just sleep. I have no feelings left towards you I remember I've got scoring tomorrow, so what? Yes, it's my movie, I remember everything. You're my executive producer. I appreciate that you cannot sleep because of the project. But it's my film No, I'm not with Natasha again. It's not Natasha. I'm watching a film. It's just voices from the film. I love you very much and I appreciate that you worry about our movie. But I'll smash my phone against the wall. Or I will saw it. You know, I've got something very suitable for that. Say hi to Natasha? What the hell. He's bought weights for the first time in his life. And he's like "I'm working out", he takes 10 kg. - With a serious face? - With a serious face, straining himself. He's like "I'll be a jock, all the girls will went me". The Oswiecim Champion in body-building. What did you say? I said, you're the Osweicim Champion in body-building. It was your last stupid joke. She's nice. Don't touch my girlfriend. Lesbo. It was you who made me sleep with girls! I'm not a lesbian. Bring me some wine. I've told Masha everything. Got it? I'm glad you're honest. He's really honest, Masha. - He'll never lie to you. - Yes, I don't lie. Yes, I had sex with 2 women. Yes, I liked it. So what? Bring me wine and stop making excuses. I feel like you are my lesbian moms and I have to justify myself for misbehavior. Bullshit. - Wina! - Maybe it's working, shall we try? Is there gasoline left the previous owner? Please, take the saw away. Go. Natasha, please. I'm your father today, stop showing your bare legs to me. If you're my daddy, bring me some wine! It's as if I'm at Caligula shooting. I cannot live with you anymore, because you're an unbearable bitch. I've never been one. And you patted that Canadian guy while I was sleeping. It's better to pat a back than to get raped. A parallel universe. You know, sometimes I think... My parents died of cancer and many people keep dying of it every day. What's cancer? It's when you want to be spread. When one cell wants to be bigger than the whole body. And when you're shooting something like this film about breakup, I wanted people watching it after breaking up with other people. And then they say: "Let more people see this film!" "Go ahead, it's cool!" and I feel like I'm a cancer cell and I think the bigger I am the cooler it'll be. People are like cancer, you know? Did you read about corporations? What are their plans? to open a chains of their restaurants in some new country. In North Korea, for example. So, their aim is to spread, and that's all. And I feel like I'm a cancer cell. I had a dream once. That a cancer cell came to the cinema and it is watching a film about the people who dying of cancer and suddenly it understands that it destroys itself and others. It comes out from the movie theater and starts crying. The cancer cell is crying because it finally understands that it kills... It kills children and itself. It's strange to think that you're cool just because more people know your name. It's bullshit. Our mothers and fathers, they were ordinary people. They gave birth to us, thanks to them we exist. Just exist. Drink wine and live day by day. And it's so cool. All right. Actually. I'm a rockstar. Masha, I'm a rocker, not a killjoy. I want to play in clubs. Fuck the filmmaking. Songs are coming from within. What are the lyrics? We'll start a band and will sing there together Will you help me? I can't do it without you, you know. - Masha, did you like the song? - I'm your fan. You've had enough. How much is the ticket to Bali now? Shall we go there? We should put a straw in here. It smells like iron. Don't worry, we'll never get away from each other. We cannot break up, because we've been together for thousands of years, under different names, with different faces and voices. But that's still us. We've always been here and forever will be. We are eternal. Like Grand Canyon. Do you understand? We are like Grand Canyon. Do you get it? Of course, I do. Let's stay in bed. .:.[Translated by Axel7902].:.
