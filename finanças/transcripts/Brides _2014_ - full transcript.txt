I'm after these ladies. Mum, Liza peed her pants. Sandro, call grandma, maybe someone has extra panties. Grandma, Liza peed, can you ask somebody for panties?

I wear it only during the training. - Do you shoot? - Yes, every day. Will you bring a real machine gun when you will be back? Yes, I will. Pass to grandma. Mom, how are you? - You look very skinny. - Do I? Eat butter and honey. Take care of your lungs. Kids can come! Sandro, go! They are coming. - Can I follow until the entrance? - No, it's not allowed! Come to me sweety, look daddy. - She couldn't recognise me. - No, she just became very moody. Do my friends come to see you? No. Don't they call? Sergo called once and Kote too. My mother gets old so fast... Say goodbye to the prisonners! Is it over? Goga! Come... Come to me sweety. - How is the boy? - He is fine, he says hello to you. Come to me. Sit in the car. Kids, come here and stand here. Sandro, make a wish. We will count until three. Count loundly, let's go! One... Two... Three... Clap! Yes, Goga. Wait. It's daddy. Yes, daddy. Why didn't you come? Me, Liza and mom are celebrating my birthday. - Where is daddy? - In the army. - In the army? - Yes, in Irak. Is it true that they have a huge salary there? Why can't you come? It's not far. Sandro, where did you appear from? I haven't seen you for so long. Who is she? Go and choose the fir tree. I will come. Who are you? I am so ashamed, I couldn't see you. I wanted to call you but I'm so busy before new yearâ€¦ It becomes even worse. I apologize It's ok. - You look great. - Thank you. Any news? I talked to Goga on his birthday. Do you wait for him? What are you asking? - How many years has he left? - Seven years. I met one guy, a prosecutor. He deals with petitions... He can help. He can't do anything now, but for the Easter Goga could be out. - Does he want money in advance? - No, only 1,000 dollars. In total he asks for 20,000 dollars. - 1.000 dollars, what for? - For petty expenses. 1 000 dollars for petty expenses... Where will you find all that money? I don't know... I will sell the house. Sell the house... there is no guarantee. What are you doing? Watering plants during the rain! I don't know, let's go inside. I have some presents for the kids. Kids, come here! Let's go choose the decoration for the Christmas tree. Streets are decorated for the New Year. Have you already decorated the Christmas tree? Yes, the small one. And we are waiting for Santa. - Have you read Mishima's Patriotism? - No. This story reminds me of us. The husband carries out hara-kiri. And his wife does the same thing. They die together. Read it and you will understand everything... How great it is to be married when your second half is waiting for you outside. If prison was necessary to understand this, I will cope with that. I just... I want to tell you that I love you, Nutsa. I have no one except you. I just wanted to say that. 800. I want 1,000. It's very old and damaged. It doesn't cost that much. 800. I need 1.000. I give you 1.000 with this vase. You are so thin and you still smoke. I have a cancer. So young! Take it. So... - These trousers are too wide. - OK. Where can I put it? I will take your measurements. - Should I take off the pants? - No. Is it how you wear trousers? Turn! Not that much. Is this length OK? As you wish. As I wish... That's it. When should I come back? Tomorrow? Call me before. Nutsa. OK I will. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. That's it. Put them in the grass! This one is broken. It's so nice... You could open the window. Come on... - Will you go to the cemetery on Monday? - No, I will go there later. OK. Nutsa. I'm free until Tuesday. I can take kids to my place. Take them. Hang the carpet back, the Easter has come. - I sold it. - How could you do that? I hate carpets. What are you telling me? It belonged to our ancestors. It was the wedding's present for Liza. Stop it, please. This carpet darkened the room. - Isn't it pretty? - Yes it's pretty. I don't know what he wants. I have very nice knees. And Spring has come. I can show my legs. Stop there. - Up to here? - Yes, but don't cut. Hem one centimeter. - Didn't you want a mini skirt? - Yes, but my husband will get crazy. So, let's reduce one centimeter every week, but don't cut. All right. Let's reduce a bit more, nobody will see. I can't understand why he is against. You look great. Excuse me. Is it sweet? Yes, it's very good. - Shorten here? - Yes, a little bit. Sandro, don't move! Yes, Levan. It's me, Nutsa. I have bad news for you. - What happened? - That prosecutor was arrested. - Why? - For cheating... What can I do now? It's my fault. Don't worry, I will give you that money back. OK. Shorten here? It's good. Wait Sandro, wait dear. Dodo. Taste it! Let's drink coffee. I will take a chair. That's it. Can you check that my husband doesn't see me smoking. I will make coffee. - Does Sandro like the school? - Yes, he likes the teacher. Most of his classmates have no fathers. Some are arrested, some are divorced. But everyone hides it. So, I said Sandro has no father. Poor kids. Wake up, we will be late to see daddy. Go in! Please come in, I'm still waiting. She is here. - Sorry. - Where were you? - Where are the kids? - They refused to come. What? - Where are the kids? - Sandro has an exam at school. - Today? - Tell me how are you? I'm gettting crazy! I didn't deserve that. I'm not that guilty to be here for 10 years. Why didn't you take Liza? - She couldn't leave the kitten. - Kitten... When kids and friends forget about you, what should I want to get out for. And I think that I will never get outside. I'm nearly sure about that. Tell me about yourself. Nothing. Same thing everyday, work, home, kids. Work, home, kids... Nutsa, please don't come here every month like an obligation. Hello. Mom, there is a man asking for you. I left home, can I stay here? Are they yours? Then I go. Come in, you will not sleep in the street. - Where? - Put it here. Do you want some tea? Take off your jacket. Just a second This is broken, it doesn't go fast. Is it good like this? What's that? Is it a rabbit? - Do you want to move the table? - Yes. It's not enough for four. Did you bring your kitten? Bachana, can you eat like a cat? No. Sandro, behave! Show me your muscles. My muscles... Look! My father has bigger muscles. Tea... Where did I put it? Don't you want some? A small one. Bachana fixed my bicycle. Mom, it's daddy. Yes, Goga. - What's wrong with the bicycle? - Nothing. What? Hello? The bicycle was broken and now it's fixed. - Who fixed it? - A neighboor. Do I disturb you? No, I'm just tidying up. Can't you hear me? Not well. Isn't it a good time to call you? No, I'm putting kids to bed. How can you call this late? The former officer is back and he allowed me to call. - Did somebody come? - No, nothing. - Something is wrong with you. - No, I just went outside. All right. Good night. Goga! Something happened? No, nothing. Who was it? My husband. Where is he? In prison. Since long? When will he be out? In six years. And... Once he's out... will you be together? What can I do? - Who is he? - Nobody, mom What is he doing here? You got crazy? The prisonner refuses to come for the visit. Oh no... - Is he ill? - No, don't worry, he's healthy. Don't you hide anything from me? He refused himself, here is a signature. - Isn't he beatten? - No, don't worry, he will call you. - Will he call me? - He will. They said he will call. Why isn't he calling? We will come home and he will call. I will get off here. We will drive you home. No, I want to walk. - You're getting bald like me. - I'm not young anymore. You look great. - How are you? - I'm fine. I'm fit. - How are the kids? - Kids are fine. - Do you still keep the gun? - Yes. - Don't you go hunting? - I can't see properly anymore. Don't say that. When you will be out, let's go hunting together. I started writing. Then they forbade it and I started gathering material in my head. World becomes tight between four walls. Pass the doorway carefully! Be careful. Maybe it's not the right time for the fir-tree. It will grow this big until Christmas. Don't shake it, come down and wait for me. Strange shape but unique type. Kids, you need to water it once a week and it will grow. - Is it the New Year? - Somehow yes. - Are there any news? - No, no news. - Is everything all right? - Yes. I have to run, sorry that I can't help you. Call me if you need me. Don't worry, everything will be fine, it's just a matter of time. Pretend that it is a New Year. Thank you. Levan, it was not necessary. Do you have "Patriotism" by Mishima? Mishima's Patriotism... - Which country? - It's a Japanese story. What is it about? It is about love. The husband is a soldier... and he commits suicide... he carries out hara-kiri and his wife also... - They both carry out hara-kiri... - And? And they die. Oh, poor people. Pity them... I have better books, look. I read it third time, it is also about love. What's going on here? Nutsa, what did I tidy up the flat for? Take it! I'm allowed to stay with Goga for one day. In prison? What's that? Where did you find that dress? I was wearing this dress on our first date. Are you going to wear it? Tasteless. Show me! You did all this mess for this dress? You are crazy. Give it to me, at least I will iron it. Are you all on private meeting? Stop here! Stand next to the wall! Hurry up! Go inside! Are you on private meeting? Come in quickly and stand here! Quickly! Next! Quickly! I'm very nervous. Me too. I can't decide to go inside or not. Do we need to take off everything during the check? I don't know, I don't think so. Can we go together on the check? I'm affraid to go there alone. Why? Hello. - Are you also on private meeting? - Yes. Could you help me? My daughter doesn't understand Georgian. She has to register there. Come in! Stand there. Get ready for the check. Take off all jewelery, accessories. - Let's go together. - No, come one by one! Come inside! What a good thing they invented, what a nice shade. Give me your bag! Hair clip! Quickly! Scarf! It's for your safety... not to choke you with this scarf. Last week we rescued a woman nearly choked. Take off your underwear! Quickly, take it off! Everyone come out! Come out! Hurry up! Look toward the wall Look, there is daddy. Come to me, son. Come inside. Lisa, come to daddy. - How are you? - I'm like a bear in a cage. Lisa, come to daddy. I hope there is no camera here. My friend was here and he told me there is a jacuzzi. Wow! Toilet... Nutsa look, he thought it was a jacuzzi. He is in prison for 14 years, I think he has never seen a jacuzzi. He was telling that he filled it with water and laid down in it. How could he fit in it? Wow, hot water! In six years, when I will be out, so many things will be changed. I will not be able to walk alone in the street. Here? Isn't it better? It's like we were at home. - Yes. - At least, pretend. - Don't you want roasted chicken? - No, I don't want. Come on, I haven't eaten it since the Easter. Which ice cream would you like? Let's take the big one, "Family Pack". Vaso! Hello. Vaso... Tell me what you need. Don't worry, everything will be sorted out. - OK, I got it. - Thank you. I can't believe this is happening It's like a dream... Goga! Goga! You are already here. Take this one. And this one too. - Thank you, Vaso. - Take care. Bye. I imagined everything but not this... Why did he give it so secretly? No need to hit me! It's forbidden here. Why is it not allowed? It sticks to the shoes of the director. We can have big problems. Banana chewing gum... Bandanas are forbidden... Sugar is already forbidden. It was so complicated to get these gums. If Vaso gets caught with it, he will be punished. Take the coffee. - Don't you want coffee? - I made it for both of us. God! I made it like I'm used to. In one cup for everyone. I missed even this... I will call Misha Misha, maybe they also want coffee. Misha Misha! I am here Goga. - How are you? - Nutsa, how are you Nutsa? Meet Ani! Ani, how are you? Hello. - What a wonderful day, isn't it Goga? - Yes. Can you imagine this may happen? Don't you want some coffee? Have you also made it in one single cup for both? - No, Ani made it. - Good, you're lucky. This mole... These scars... Is this a new one? It's such a happiness to be alone with you. I sleep with forty men during four years. Did I get old? I have grey hair. I count the days, but they don't pass and I get old. Here you get older faster than outside. In the morning, I have to wait in line for the bathroom. Then in the line for a table... for breakfast Then I come down to call you. I wait two hours here. In the line for the phone. Here's how time passes. But time does not pass. Can you imagine where I spend these years? Do you want some chocolate? Take it and go back to your parents. I fall asleep. Nutsa, please stay young for me. I hope it will rain. It will get cooler. Remember when you were going to fly to Moscow? And flight was cancelled because of the havy rain. Do you recall it? I have nothing else to do. I am remembering every single day, every good day. Rewinding every minute, and review from the beginning. It's a good exercive for memory. It's seven o'clock. At this time, they are locking us in the cells. I don't want to be outside. I am fed up being here. Can you understand me? You're my only love You, beautiful, my beloved For those around you You're a shining diamond I loved you, I love you And I will keep loving you I hope your hands Will close my eyes when I pass away - Misha Misha, is that you? - Yes it's me. Did you notice that you don't stammer during the singing? Did you like it? Try to talk with us singing. It's so great. I want to drink it! It's so great! Missed this so much... I loved you, I love you. And I will keep loving you I hope your hands Will close my eyes when I pass away Guards. First. Second. Third. Hello, Vaso! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Will I see you again in six months? For six years I will see you twelve times... Twelve times... I can't eat. Come on! Please eat. I know you like it. Please. I will make the bed. You put the forbidden chewing gum here. Well done! Misha, look what I have got, I want you to take some for the guys. Give them to me I will hide it in the stick. Say goodbye to your wifes. You have half an hour. You have red spots from my beard. Don't you have any cardigan? Put it on. Please. Stand near the tree. I want daddy. I will not come here again. I will try to move him to the hospital. The doctor told me he will speak better after some time. He can walk now... If he was not arrested, he would be dead. Open the door for the ambulance. Open the door! He said don't come here anymore. Hurry up! One guard follow inside. Hurry up, hurry up, follow inside! Close the door. Move toward the wall. Close the door faster. Two men go upstairs.
