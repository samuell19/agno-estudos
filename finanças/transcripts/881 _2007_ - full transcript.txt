In 1982, there were 38,100 babies born in Singapore. Among them were Little Papaya and Big Papaya. Little Papaya was premature and only weighed one kilogram. Big Papaya's weight was normal, 2.5 kilograms. Big Papaya loved the stars, while Little Papaya loved the moon. So they were happiest during flag-raising. At the age of nine, Little Papaya lost Mom to leukemia. At age ten, she lost Dad to liver cancer. At 25, she herself would die of liver cancer. When Big Papaya was nine, her mother changed husbands. At ten, her mom changed again. In the same year, she remarried the first husband. Big Papaya was good at studying, went to college, and became president of the cultural club. Little Papaya failed all her subjects and ended up selling papayas. Papayas, one for $3! My favorite time of the year is the lunar seventh month. In the seventh month, the gates of hell open and ghosts roam the streets. During this time, Singapore is full of life. Audiences fill the streets. Unseen audiences, even more. "Getai," lively stage shows, are staged to entertain the spirits. Originally there were only Hokkien and Teochew opera. Getai evolved during the '60s into popular entertainment shows. This is Getai, where we entertain the spirits once a year. The best loved of these Getai singers is, without a doubt, "Hokkien Star," Chen Jin Lang. On the seventh month of that year, Big Papaya and Little Papaya met by chance at a Chen Jin Lang Getai. They became sworn sisters. This is how the Papaya Sisters' story begins. How sad How pitiful my life is There is work but I refuse to do it I just laze on my bed the whole day I roam the streets at night Just like a crazy sleaze I am penniless, yet I have no worries Every woman I see looks good to me Regardless of age I want to carry them to the park for some fun But I had better think things through And turn over a new leaf soon If I get charged I may eventually end up in jail This is Wang Lei, Prince Charming of the local Getai scene. Karen, the princess of the local Getai scene. These three ladies are HIV... Holy Innocent Virgins. This is the blind ranger, Chen Wei Lian. How was it? Look at my son, wearing his father's clothes, constantly playing with that bird. He is deaf and dumb. Are you deaf and dumb, too? Say something! This is horrible singing! Singing? You call this singing? Quiet! One at a time! You first. They're great! Such nice figures. If they were whores, I would drop my pants now! Those clothes are too outdated! It wouldn't work. Okay, let's be fair. Their voices are good. Now, there's too much techno. Old-fashioned is better for them! In order to be unique, they can't be techno! Techno? What is techno? What? You don't know techno? Techno is tech-no. If there's tech, there's no. If there's no, there's tech. That is techno. You go out and look at the sky, techno, please let me win the lottery! You see an old man, you say techno, have you eaten? Aunty, techno, how are you? You don't even know this techno? Tech, tech, tech to your death. I think you're a "techno sleaze." You know nothing. Go back to your worksite! Your combined age is over a hundred. I'm just asking you here to help, to provide some suggestions, and you just make a bunch of noise! These two can't make it, and then there's you! Two strips of BBQ pork and a chunk of lard! Too fat! You should return to tailoring clothes! Okay, okay! Stop quarrelling! They're okay! The market lacks Hokkien singers now. They just lack a little chemistry, like glasses without eyes, cows without milk. Quiet! No English! Wei Lian, you're impartial. Speak! Actually, I feel the dancing and singing is secondary. The most important thing is to have a sincere voice. Put simply, they lack "feel." Feel? Hey, Huang Lei, ask someone to buy feel. Where's it sold? Buy it all up! You don't even know "feel"? I can't help you anymore. Only the deaf want to hear them sing. Find some other expert! I'm out of ideas! The only hope is to look for your twin sister, the omnipotent "Fairy of the Getai"! She will teach you how to fly and dig underground. Aunt Ling, you have a twin sister known as the "Getai Fairy"? Say something! Why haven't you mentioned her? I haven't seen her for more than 20 years. Since we fell out 20 years ago, I've not been in contact with her. Maybe this is fate! My twin sister, didn't you say that you would be a useless person if you came back to see me? Yes, I am useless, that's why I'm here to look for you. For so many years I actually wondered if you were dead. Yesterday I saw someone in the obituaries who resembled you, so I dropped by to check! Aunt Ling! Fairy, transcendent person, you are kind and helpful, that is why we are here. Fairy, many Getai sisters say that we lack "feel" when singing, but I don't know what "feel" is! And all the other Getai Sisters have their own signature songs, but we don't, and we don't know what to sing either. Please guide us. Yet another Sisters group. Forget it! After so many years you still haven't changed! Even NTUC has had a makeover, and you still refuse to change? Let's go! Aunty Ling! - Fairy! - Fairy! - Fairy! - Fairy! Don't worry, she will not die so easily. However, if you want my guidance, listen carefully. Is singing that important to you? I am willing to go through anything. We just want to sing well. Is it more important than the one you love most? Is it more important than life itself? If there were no music, our lives would be meaningless. Fairy, if we don't sing, we would be heartbroken. We have a thousand reasons to be sad that we can't finish saying. Actually, you don't understand my heart. My heart hurts like it's been cut, I only need your help. All your words, Fairy... Who knows our torment? We only want to be songstresses of the world, singing the thoughts of wanderers. Please let us light up the hearts of millions, and be the best in the world! Fairy, women should sympathize with other women Actually, I want nothing but go into the sky and watch the earthy world. Please take me away from this dark world, and let me find the happiness I want! Fairy, I dreamt of you last night. You are the lady of mystery, you were in the sky, healing the world. Fairy, if not for you, we, the flowers of tears will be empty-handed, wandering aimlessly and not returning home tonight. Please understand our hearts! Fairy, time is running out. We, the Papaya Sisters, make our decision right here. We love you like mice love rice. How can you bear to see us in pain, Fairy? You will achieve your dreams, but there is a high price to pay! We are willing to pay any price. I have five rules you need to abide by. One, pay your respects to spirits. Two, be kind to people. Three, watch your words. Four, obey the rules of each respective Getai. Five, stay out of trouble, and don't fall in love with men. Can you do it? Have I made myself clear? All right, I bestow upon you the divine feathers, and the voices of the Mingzhu Sisters! Thank you, Fairy! The first chapter of my pitiful life Born into a red-light district and life is hard Life is terrible and I am in a bad state I have to slog hard to make a living The second chapter of my pitiful life My life is hard and my heart hurts My stepmother did not take me into consideration She only wanted to marry for a meal ticket How sad, how pitiful my life is! The Papaya Sisters have blossomed and unknowingly became The Durian Sisters' greatest enemies. With the glittering lights and thunderous music, they find fulfillment from the live audience but even more so from the audience that they cannot "see." The Papaya Sisters love each other. It is a love that will bond them together. They were fast moving from stage to stage. Big Papaya runs from her family. Little Papaya is singing against time. PAPAYA SISTERS MAKE A STIR Mom, I'm going out. Stop there! What's this? Didn't I say you shouldn't be singing? I... You love to sing? Love to sing very much, don't you? Then you go sing, you go out and sing, and never return! Mom... You leave if you want to sing, and never return! Mom... All right, don't cry! Don't worry, you can live here with me, but I'm not comfortable having you live with my son. He may be deaf and dumb, but he's just like his father, a sex maniac! Can chicken droppings wipe away tears? Which outfit did your mother not like? The green one, the white one, the red one, the black one, or the brown one? Aunty Ling, you're thinking too much! My mother has nothing against your clothes, she just doesn't like me singing Getai. Get it away! Can't you understand? Your mother is too old-school. But problems that can't be solved now will not remain unsolvable forever. The only thing you can do now is wait. Time will prove everything! The tiger is vicious, yet it does not bite its own child. So you must wait. It will eventually be yours. Life is just like a show Our fortunes are destined by heaven Do not blame your parents for a bad life Do not complain that society is unfair Our fate is destined from the moment we were born Good, bad, it's all in the birth characters Some are born with a silver spoon Some have to beg for their entire lives Life is like a flowing river When youth runs by, it will never return Do not fuss about whether you are rich or poor Be content if you have enough to get by BAO HAO GETAI Will the owner of car SFZ4412K please move your car, you're blocking someone else. And those who haven't displayed your coupons, please do so now. The inspector is here! Thank you. Now I'm in a jail cell regretting... The Papayas were loved by everyone. My car was always there for them. $20 per song, four songs, and we will move on to the next Getai. Their happiness, that was my reward for driving them. When you have no dreams, it's nice to be able to help others achieve their dreams. Hello, Boss? This is 881, we're rushing over now. Queue? How many ahead of us? Two more? Okay! Quarreling in the car was common, because everyone is under pressure. This is the correct way. There are so many traffic lights that way! If we miss one stage tonight, we'll be fired. I was like an F1 driver. An endless race. From Chua Chu Kang to Sengkang. From Woodlands to Holland. Stage to stage. That's enough! Tearing the house down? So noisy. You love noise so much, why don't you play at funerals? At least you can make some money! I smell love on you. Nowadays you carry your cock differently. I'm your mom. I gave birth to you. Tell me, which of the two girls do you like? If you like the older one, scratch fast. If you like the younger one, scratch slow. You sex maniac! Secrets have no answers. Quiet ones have the most secrets. I live on the stage. I am willing to live for the stage and die for the stage. Even though things are difficult today, and I may die here after singing, I will die without regrets, because my greatest solace in life is having so many supporters. Thank you for your encouragement! When the Papaya Sisters saw Chen Jin Lang performing in his wheelchair, their silence was more deafening than the applause they received. What are you thinking about? Thinking about you. I don't believe that. It's the seventh month now, there are spirits everywhere! There's one right next to you! Nonsense! Here. No point taking so much medication. Thinking of Chen Jin Lang? You're beautiful enough! Look more and the mirror will crack! That's why nobody wants me. Who would pick a wild flower? Who said you're a wild flower? You're a snow lotus on a high mountain! There's no snow, just ah lian. Don't curse me like that, the snow lotus wilts very quickly. Just bugging you, don't kick up a fuss! How can a wild chicken become a phoenix? Even worse, I'm a sick chicken! That goes well with Guan Yin. He loves playing with that cock! My status is lower than that bird of his! Fairy said we cannot be touched by men. Better be careful! Why don't we take that bird and... You hit my breast! Painful! Dear God, please bless Jin Lang with good health so that he can recover soon. Thank you! Take pity on me and my hard life Kind-hearted madams, please kindly donate Please donate to help me Unable to work for a living The Beggar's Song was Jin Lang's trademark song. After hearing Wei Lian sing, the sisters devoted their efforts towards Chen Jin Lang's medical bill. Little Papaya's body was failing, but she said nothing. She was constantly on stage saying, "Boss, Lady, please, "sympathize with this orphan beggar. "Please donate generously. "May you prosper." Thank you, everyone, your kindness is greatly appreciated! Thank you! These are funds we raised in his name. Thank you! Hello! Hello! Techno cat! The flowers bloom more beautifully than I today! Ah Kun, is the meat fresh today? Yes! I heard one of the Papaya Sisters is not feeling well, I'll give her some pig liver. - For free? - Yes! Now, I don't have to buy! Give me all your freebies! I heard they're singing at many locations. I'd better not say, otherwise people may think I'm boastful. Over a hundred Getais have engaged their services! Freebies! Get them out here! Sure! Here you go! I profited! LIANHE WANBAO Techno... Hello! You're sitting so high, courting disaster? Techno! Hello, techno! Is there a Getai here today? Queueing up so early? Take it out. Let her see it! We have no choice. It's just the newspaper! KING OF GETAI CHEN JIN LANG DIES I don't know if this happens to every Getai singer. During a performance, the songs are irresistibly powerful, but in real life, there is only silence. For Little Papaya, she could see herself suffering the same fate as her idol. For Big Papaya, it seems like another loved one has forsaken her. It was a big blow to her. Since you Stepped out of the door I can neither eat nor sleep And my limbs feel weak I'm sitting in the hall Waiting for you through the night But there has been no news of you And you did not return I don't know if it is fate or coincidence, but this kiss of mine seems to have changed the fate of the Papaya Sisters. Next year's Getai seems to have started a major makeover. THE SCREEN & STAGE PICTORIAL I am only in my 40s this year But I am tortured by this disease I am on the brink of death, yet I am still alive Struggling with what remains of my life I pray to heaven and Buddha To end my misery soon I call out to my late parents To take me to the other world To keep you company Mom and I are both strong, but we can be vulnerable when no one's around. YEAR 2 Spirits, please bless us, let them have a successful year on Getai this year. Help them to attend every single Getai and not miss out on any. No traffic jams, ensure all the cars stay at home! Bless them with good health, and let my son not play with that chicken all day. And remember, bless me with good complexion, and let me always be beautiful. Let us prosper! I've booked all the Getais for you this year. Even though the doctor says you're getting better, you still have to take care of yourself! You, stop smoking so much! His joss sticks and incense are suffocating enough. Here, this has been blessed, eat it and you'll prosper. - Prosper! - Prosper! Prosper! How do I eat such a big piece? Good, this gives me a chance to serve you. I can cut a piece off for you everyday. Put this in the fridge, and serve it to the guests at my funeral. Silly child! Be quiet. How can you say such inauspicious things in the seventh month? You can only say: Chi Hwa Hwa. Chi Hwa Hwa Louder Chi Hwa Hwa Louder Chi Hwa Hwa Louder! Chi Hwa Hwa We'll each take half And our love won't fall apart We'll each take a little And our love will last long Different people have different relationships How can they be compared? We'll each take a bite And we'll never split up Everyone has dreams of their own Why am I so obsessed with you? I long for you, my heart hurts for you And yet you ditched me heartlessly The more I think, the more confused I get Because of you I feel lost And my heart feels heavy You have your pursuits You have your dreams How would you possibly think of me as your love? We'll each take half And our love won't fall apart We'll each take a bite And we'll never split up Ong Bok Kwa. Are you still on your medication? You know about the side effects of steroids, right? The doctor said my condition has improved greatly. So, I can continue singing this year. He didn't prescribe any medicine today. Little Papaya said nothing. She just remained silent. We'll each take half And our love won't fall apart We'll each take a little And our love will last long Stop singing. How shameful! They've made up and you're still singing, how shameful! Sister! Sister! You can't sing better than me no matter how hard you try. Give it up! All right, we'll not sing. - We're going on strike! - What? Going on strike? I almost forgot to tell you, I have booked many Getais for you! By the way, Yes, I must tell you, there are rules for performing at Getais! What rules? Waiting For Nobody can't be sung, waiting for nobody means waiting for ghosts! I Laugh Whenever I See You also can't be sung. It's too short, and bosses don't like it. Either he goes crazy or you go crazy! It Is Raining Non-stop also can't be sung. The gods don't like it when it rains non-stop. And also, I'll Wait For Your Eventual Return can't be sung too. If you sing it, you're asking the spirits to wait for you! It's okay if the God of Hell shows up. It would be horrible if an old sex maniac showed up! Yes, Aunty Ling, every time we change, there would be Peeping Toms around! Some would even grope us by force! You've struck gold! If you meet someone like that again, give him my number. If he needs love, I'll give it to him because I need love too! But I'm afraid when he tries to open the can, he'll slam it back shut because he'll see how rusty it is. Aunty Ling, not the old sex maniacs! You've already met that big sex maniac, what else are you afraid of? In my heyday, his father kept grabbing my butt, and it got bigger! Sex maniac techno! No response. Guan Yin! Sex Maniac techno! Sex Maniac techno! My mom loves to take in the strays. Here, we are all strays. It's come loose! Has it come loose? Move a little. Don't forget to pluck the hairs! It's so loose? Can't be! I'm very accurate even when it comes to gambling, why is it not accurate this time? Guan Yin! It's so stretched out of shape! Guan Yin! Look! It's so stretched out of shape. Yeah, I think so too. Be professional, not personal! This darned chicken! Who takes measurements this way? Your eyes can only look one way, not two! How can you be accurate like this? Be professional, concentrate, think harder. You can only eat one bowl of rice at a time. If you eat too fast, you'll break the bowl. You'll choke trying to eat two bowls at once! Just like your father! I'll help him. Hand. The sun is already up, you're still sleeping? Even the cock has risen, and you're still sleeping. There are many shows tonight. If you miss out on any, you're in trouble! I reserved this seat, this is my seat! What, your seat? Is your name written on it? Why did you throw my stuff there? Didn't you see my stuff here just now? What? That's your stuff? I thought that was garbage! Didn't you see my clothes hanging here? Get them to sing, then! Get your clothes to sing! But I was here much earlier! If I didn't see you, it doesn't count! You think I'm afraid of you? Auntie, you see, she is so unreasonable. If you are not seen in the queue, it doesn't count! What do you want? You want a fight? You stupid bamboo pole... As Mom says, laws are laws, rules are rules. Getai works on a first come first serve basis, even if you have a mountain to back you. In January Women come out for a stroll with their husbands Traffic is congested and the streets are noisy Godfather! Relax! I don't want to! Relax! Her husband passed away when she was 17 or 18 Her eyes are red and she weeps When will her son grow up? Godfather, look at Papaya! Disgusting! Acting cute! Don't worry, Durians are the best! Thanks, Godfather! Xue Mei feels a lump in her throat Whenever she sees her son It has been drizzling the entire night Xue Mei does not weave nor do embroidery She sits by the memorial table the entire day Hey, look! What are Getai singers most afraid of? Missing bookings! Let's mess them up! So clever! In March it is the Qing Ming Festival Families go and pay respects to the dead The next stage, go! Guan Yin, let's go! You... That's enough! Do you know the rules? You two hog one side each. You sure she can make it here in time? - No problem! - You want to queue? Sure, we'll queue here too! What if she doesn't show up? Whatever. Leave! Go... What are you doing? Get out! Go... Thank you, Godfather! Hello? I can't hear you... Aunty Ling, can you come down now? Those spoof singers are picking on us. Wherever we go, they're there to block us. We'll miss a show tonight at this rate. - What do we do? - What? Curse them! Wait for me! Shut the door! - Hurry up! - Wait for me! In May, the Dragon Boat Festival has arrived Drums and gongs make a din at the lake Women come in and join the festivities With their husbands and children Only Xue Mei stays in her empty bedroom A pair of lovebirds has been torn apart A loving couple has been ruthlessly separated My son is still young How long must I wait before he grows up? We got here first! We were queueing here much earlier! Don't jump the queue! Which eye of yours saw us jumping the queue? Everyone is trying to make a living. Why are you always harassing us? Do we? No? You stole so many of our shows. What more do you want? Yeah? Techno bitch! Tech your head! Funny calling yourselves "Papaya" even though you have no boobs. Relax. Better than you brainless Durians! Rotten Spoof Singers! What? How dare you snatch our Fairy's feathers? What lousy Fairy? Just a retired old fart! Better than you two Durians! You can't even lip-sync properly! Sluts. Go kill yourself! Don't fight! Hold it! What are you doing? You're Getai singers, not hooligans out to cause trouble. What happened? Speak. What is there to say? If I say the Durian Sisters sing, they sing. What did you say? What? My friend, there are rules at the Getai. You don't get to call the shots! Rules? What rules? Their shoe is already on stage. What rules? Shoe on stage? My clothes have been hanging here since yesterday, does that count? What are you talking about? You're not happy? If you weren't a woman, I'd punch you in the face! Excuse me, how are you related to them? I am their Godfather! Yes! With money you are their Godfather, without money you can only cry for their father! What? Let me tell you. Singing at Getai is not about whose fist is bigger. This is Xian Yin Getai, the highest authority is the boss. Boss, what do you say? Getai is only for a month, the seventh month. If you want to squabble over who is going to sing, I think we should decide by the divination chips. Yes, this sounds reasonable. Let's throw the divination chips! Go ahead! You might not win! That you don't know! We'll see! All right, let's throw the chips. Let's throw! Spirits, please... The holy combination! We win! Yes, you might have won. But we know your every move. Beware of retribution! Those rotten spoof singers! Does it hurt? I just want to finish this year's singing well! Not only this year. We will sing on for many years! I just want to complete this year's singing. We are the fearless Papaya Sisters! I just want to complete this year's singing. Don't be afraid. Even if we lose everything, we still have Aunty Ling, we still have Guan Yin, we still have many years! I just want to complete this year's singing. We have plenty of time. I just want to complete this year's singing. We have plenty of time. We have plenty of time. I just want to complete this year's singing. God of the town, please bless the Papaya Sisters so that they will gain popularity, and their popularity will last! Also, let those two Durians run into trouble every time. Let them rot and stink, so that they won't trample on others! Guan Yin, the weapon! Is this the weapon? Hurry up, you're always so slow! Just like your father. What's there to see? Can you recite this? Can you say this? Go back and play with your chicken. "Techno!" Go back and play with your chicken, don't you understand? I'll hit your head, hit you till you can't stick your head out... Aunty Ling, they're not Cantonese. Simple. I'll hit your head, hit you till you can't stick your head out... Aunty Ling, they speak English! English! They know, I know too! Hit the little man's head, hit him until he's dizzy. Hit the little man's mouth, hit. Aren't we vicious doing this? We can't do this. We are religious people. We must overcome them with moral values. Mine is damaged, can't be used anymore. You hit! Hit! What are you waiting for? Touch your durian head So that good fortune will follow you Touch your durian face So that you have a good network Touch your durian hand So that you will have good co-ordination Touch your durian heart So that you'll be happy every day! Sisters, let's do it! Touch your durian head So that good fortune will follow you... Dad! You're back! Come on in! Where's Mom? She went grocery shopping. She'll be back soon. Have a seat. Dad, this money... No. Having you back is good enough. Or why not wait for your mother to come back, then you can give it to her? How are things? Everything fine? Aunty Ling is a little crazy sometimes, but she is very kind to me. That puts my mind at ease. She's back. Mom, this money is for you. I... She's like that, don't take it to heart. Are you crazy? She came back out of goodwill to see you and even gave you money. How could you have done that? I know she sings at Getai, but what's wrong with that? Weren't you a Getai singer as well? How could you do that? Mother, mother My dearest mother You've had Such a pitiful life I'm kneeling in front of you Calling out to you Even your soul Seems to have dissipated The worst good-for-nothing is someone like me Able-bodied, but lazy and refusing to work I've caused my family great financial trouble Now I'm in prison lamenting my past It's well-known even if nobody says it But times are really hard now! Damn, it's them again! Stinking spoof singers! How can you bring your family overseas? It's well-known even if nobody says it But times are really hard now! Do not spend lavishly When the economy is bad, you will suffer! Get me my medicine. You should be pragmatic Do not act arbitrarily The various different lotteries Buy some with the hope of striking it rich Everyone says this Everyone knows this Times are really hard now! Guan Yin! Only women with no substance need to rely on a man. Shameless! Only women with no substance backstab others! You came looking for a duel? Any time! You can't speak Mandarin properly, yet you try to sing at Getai! The 30th night of this month! Location? Li Xing Stage! Losers... - Should retire forever! - Should retire forever! - We're on! - We're on! Whatever. Bye-bye. Little Papaya! Hold her quick! BATTLE OF THE FRUITY SISTERS Do not complain That society is unfair Our fate is destined the moment we were born Good, bad, it's all in the birth characters Some are born with a silver spoon Some have to beg for their entire lives The newspapers have nothing better to do. Such a trivial matter, and they make such a big fuss! You, your health is worsening! The doctor tells me you have to do doctor therapy... No, it's chemotherapy! And you're still worried about Getai matters? Those two Durians, they're pretty, they're rich, they lead an easier life, you can't fight with them! Stop thinking about Getai matters! Also, your mother told me to take good care of you. If something goes wrong, how am I going to face her in the nether world? Aunty Ling, didn't you say that for problems that cannot be solved immediately, we have to wait and it will be resolved. But how can one who has little time left wait? You... You're crazy! I'll tell your mother later! Those who fight will win! Start working! Prosper! Little Papaya insisted on being discharged from the hospital. Everyone came to support her, because we all knew this might be her last performance. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Walk. Karen! Come! Here are the costumes I used to wear, see if you need them? I'll go spy on the Durian sisters to see what they're singing. Quick! I'll go undercover! Man, you're a mess! Rehearse properly! Walk, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Turn, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Qiu Li, hello! Little Papaya! - Qiu Li. - Hello. Thanks for helping Jin Lang in the past. Here's some money to tide you over during the hard times. I hope things go well and you succeed! - Thank you! - Thank you! Come support us Durian Sisters! We're giving away free CDs! Come support us Durian Sisters! We're giving away free CDs! One, two, three, four... What is it? Thank you! Thank you! Come support us Durian Sisters! We're giving away free CDs! Thank you! Papaya, goodbye! They think they're running for elections, so elaborate! Come on! We have our supporters too! One, two, three, four! 881, swing and swing! - Hello? - Aunty Ling? I know what they're singing! The first song is The Spring Wind, the second song is Can't Stand It... Hello? Damn, did her phone get wet? Put that down! Listen to the Durians if you don't want to be a prostitute! Thankfully there are only the two of you. If there were another two, it would be the death of me! Am I that old? What? How can you talk about your mother like that? I'm so pitiful! An assassin! Message on the feather! The Fairy sends an edict for me to go see her! You'd better not go in. You can't talk anyway, and I'm afraid you would offend her. I'll go in myself. I've been on the Getai Circuit for so many years, but I've never seen such tyranny and monopoly. The Durian Sisters are the worst people I've seen! Not only do they throw darts at singers, they curse them as well. This time, they're out in full force to get you! Aunty Ling has suffered the most. We're not rich, and she has to borrow from everyone, beg for costumes from everyone, and sew day and night! You are the roots of the Papaya and the leaves of the Papaya. I am the Papaya tree. If a tree has no roots and no leaves, it will die. Fairy, please guide us again! I am addressing you as Fairy, I beg you to help them, please give them a way out. Would you please help them? Seems like it is fated that we've met. Let me give you a word of advice: for every effect, there's a cause. No matter how good you are, there will always be someone superior. - You mean... - You mean... Let me, the Fairy, protect you. However, there is a limit to the protection. Everything else will depend on your fortunes. Sister, back off! I'll cast my spells. You! All right, all right!

I left my hometown for five or six years Running all over the place Travelled afar to start a business Selling sundry goods It is not easy to earn even a few dollars here The sun hasn't risen but I'm already setting my stall by the street Shouting three times I'm selling coffee Don't be afraid, go get changed!

Are we fated to be together? Just take things as they are No need to search for an answer There are actually so many brokenhearted people in this world The spring breeze blows And it blows on a young man The wild birds fly And where do they go? Please do not pick the wild flowers by the road For there are but a few in this world who are willing to give their hearts On a lonely night A girls waits under a lamp A light breeze blowing in her face She is already 17 or 18 But still not married And she thinks of a young man Copycat! Techno cat! Close the doors! 881! Swing and swing! I left my hometown for five or six years Running all over the place Travelled afar to start a business Selling sundry goods Hurry! Run! It's a trap! Little Papaya... Big Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... Big Papaya... - Little Papaya... - Big Papaya... Each... Takes half and our relationship Won't split... Each takes a quarter... And our relationship will last... Little Papaya... Big Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... Little Papaya... PAPAYA SISTERS MOVE AUDIENCE TO TEARS Take me to the hospital. Take me there! Big Papaya, have we won? Fairy, I beg of you, please save Little papaya. I beg of you! You saw this coming, didn't you? It is all fate! Goddess, this is not her fate! I was the one who sinned! Goddess, I beg of you! Please let me take her place! I want to take her place! Goddess, I beg of you! Aunty Ling, I want to ask you, if the passage of time could be reversed, what would you most like to change? Many things! If you had a choice, would you still give birth to Guan Yin? Do you still miss his father? I love him! I loved him to death! But I have a secret I never told anyone. Actually, the person Guan Yin's father really loved was my sister. Aunty Ling, what does it feel like to be with a man? Talking about men, that's my forte! I can go on for three days and three nights without stopping! Please, tell me! If you love somebody, your heart will itch the moment you see him. The more you see him, the more your heart itches. The itch intensifies by a hundred times, a thousand times, 10,000 times! Only when it reaches its limit do you feel relieved! What if it is someone you truly like, you truly love? Then you'll be totally disoriented! You will even forget your father's name. You feel like the only thing you want to do is be together with him every day, and let him see every part of your body clearly. Aunty Ling, why do you always seem so happy? I am the sun, you are the moon, Big Papaya is the stars. The sun must be bright enough to brighten the moon and the stars. Then you can shine! Big Papaya, what happened to you? The seventh month is over, the spirits didn't take you back with them? What happened to you? You look like a ghost! The God of Hell forgot to haul you back there? I have something to tell you. I... My phone's battery died. Let me go charge my phone. I... Guan Yin... Take half each, and our relationship won't split. Just be happy. Tell me, was it good? Trust me, no matter what happens, I will sing on with you! The doctor seems to have changed my medicine, kept me up the entire night. Last night my parents came to take care of me. Brother Jin Lang also came to keep me company. He quit smoking, and he looks so much better! He looks even more radiant than you! Also, he was wearing a new shirt, but it wasn't as furry as ours. Ours are still more beautiful! Aunty Ling is the best! Before he left, he sang me a song. What song? Does it sound nice? I'm in great pain due to my illness Constantly visiting the hospital The injections make me lose my hair The drugs make me vomit I lie on my bed the whole day I pray to heaven and Buddha To end my misery soon I call out to my late parents To take me to the other world To keep you company Life is just like a show Our fortunes are destined by heaven Do not blame your parents for a bad life Do not complain that society is unfair Our fate is destined from birth Good, bad It's all in the birth characters Some are born with a silver spoon Some have to beg For their entire lives How sad? How sad? How pitiful my life is? The first chapter of my pitiful life Born into a red-light district And life is hard Life is terrible and I am in a bad state I have to slog hard to eke out a living The second chapter of my pitiful life My life is hard and my heart hurts Stepmother didn't care for me She only wanted to marry for a meal ticket! The third chapter of my pitiful life Often working late into the night Even if I have a fever or feel dizzy I still have to continue working The fourth chapter of my pitiful life I have to attend to customers good and bad I give them my best But they're unsatisfied They scold me and they slap me The fifth chapter of my pitiful life Some people are totally unsympathetic He gives me very little money And yet he hits me and he scolds me That was the last time I heard them singing together. After Little Papaya died, my mother never laughed again. I'm in great pain due to my illness Constantly visiting the hospital The injections make me lose my hair The drugs make me vomit I lie on my bed the whole day I pray to heaven and Buddha To end my misery soon I call out to my late parents To take me to the other world To keep you company I am only in my 40s this year But I am tortured by this disease I am on the brink of death Yet I am still alive Struggling with what remains of my life I pray to heaven and Buddha To end my misery soon I call out to my late parents To take me to the other world To keep you company Now I look forward to the seventh month more. The only time that we can be together again. During the seventh month, Getai. I pray to heaven and Buddha To end my misery soon I call out to my late parents To take me to the other world To keep you company I've had enough of the suffering here
