Fort-de-France Harbour, March 21 1942 Gently. Damn, we're losing him! Head for the hospital. ROSE AND THE SOLDIER Marshal, Marshal, here we are! Marshal Here we are! Behind you, the saviour of France We swear this, We, your boys, To serve you and follow your footsteps - Good morning, sir! - Sit down. Miss Senely. - I don't believe it. - It's the law. All single women must stay at home and start a family. First the portrait. Then crucifixes in all schools. And now we're replaced by men? - This regime is a disgrace. - Calm down, miss. Just go home. Children... I have to leave you. I'm going to miss you. But promise me you'll work hard. Yes, miss. Go sit down. I'll never forget that day. It turned my life upside down and those of many others. Based on a true story What are you doing here? Why aren't you at school? It isn't my place any more. For Marshal Pétain, a woman's place is at home. Find yourself a husband. With your character, I wish him luck! - Clémence, clean the beach house. - Why? We have a new lodger. - Who? - None of your business. I'll soon find out anyway. - He's German. - A Nazi? - In Martinique? - He's wounded. He was on a submarine. And St-Clair's taking him in? - Mum! - We've only got an hour. That's where the Jerry's staying. Want to go dancing tonight? I don't feel like it! I'm out of a job. They imprison blacks and let Germans go free. Is that him? Is he the German? Hey, cripple! Siméon! A cripple on the battlefield is totally useless! True. Seeing him here makes me want to fight. - Let's go join de Gaulle. - Wanna go on your own? - He's gonna need... - "What he needs", Augustin. What the General needs is men who are good with guns, not little girls! We ain't gonna join the British. It ain't our war. And what if Hitler wins? If Pétain and Admiral Robert bring back slavery, you'll stand idly by? The German is an enemy. His place is in jail. We should hand him over to the British. Don't talk crap! I'm not! We abduct him and hand him over. Imagine the Admiral's face. I bet he's guarded. I know how to find out. We're going out! Look. We won't be long. Sure! See you sometime! I reckon we've time to have a long nap. Maybe your sister's right about the German. You'd walk on hot coals, if she told you to, huh? - Arsehole! - You're the arsehole! You're gonna bring the house down, girls. Come with us! He knows a dancehall near the harbour. We want to eat meat! - To the French place. - Hurry up! What's this? Stop looking at her. You ain't her type. You've no chance. Ever read a book? No need. When we dance, she'll forget about books. Forget it. She's too white for you. Here. We're here to meet someone. And them? What's your problem? They're not coming. Alright. Mind what you say. They do as they please. Alright. Good evening. Hello, ladies. Be here at midnight sharp. - Spying on marines, your sister... - She's crazy, you know! Ah, Denise. My girl, what a good idea to bring a friend. You're so elegant. - What's your name? - Rose Senely. You're my guests for the evening. Don't let them get bored. If they bother you, call me. I'll deal with them. Good evening, ladies. Lieutenant Armand Sablon. Captain Meyer, a friend. Call me Jacques. Denise Laban and my friend Rose Senely. Hello. - Is this your first time here? - Yes. Are you a regular? In 1940, we weren't expecting the British blockade. We've been stuck here for 2 years. The blockade doesn't stop submarines. A German's here. He's seriously wounded. In the navy, we rescue everyone. When a man's drowning, we don't ask for ID. Shall we get a table? Are you hungry? We'd love to. Doesn't it bother you to let a German stay here? He should be in prison. We'll soon get rid of him. But we need to find a ship. My superiors are negotiating with the British. And he's allowed to walk around freely? He won't go very far with one leg. He was in hospital. His father intervened to have him treated here. A German vice admiral. Preferential treatment. Vice admiral? Are you done questioning me? - What do you want from him? - Me? Why nothing. Your table is ready. Follow me. You'll be comfy here, the two of you. Tell me about you. - What do you do? - I'm a school mistress. Even black women can pass diplomas. But Pétain has sent all women home. I'm a military man, I simply obey orders. Your favourite dish, Jacques. Chicken Colombo. Don't you like it? - It's peasant food. - Forgive me. There's so much I don't know. No wonder if you stay shut up in government house. I often escape the office to visit the island. And I must admit... I love Martinique. Where are you from? Me? I was born in a village in Alsace, in wine country. And your family? I haven't seen them in 2 years. And my daughter was born after I left. Who knows when I'll see her! She'll grow up without me. Tell me about you. I've become who I am thanks to school. My great-grandmother was a slave. I still have so much to learn. I have to go. During the curfew? I'll take you home later. Be careful, Rose. I hope to see you soon. Thank you for dinner. Lucky thing! He's dashing, Captain Meyer. Mine was so boring. I ate well though. It was so good! - Mine's obsessed with food. - Mine didn't touch her meal. Denise, just a minute! Rose. Here, this is for your family. My little sweeties, come back and see me soon. There'll always be a table for you. - Why did she say that? - For business. Right, we have to act fast. I'll make sure he isn't guarded then we'll abduct him. Count me out. Let's do it together. I don't want you getting hurt. Simeon, I'm not a child anymore. No-one will stop me going! Just because your dad paid for your education! Hyppolite brought me up. He's my father. Octave doesn't count. I don't need advice from a coward who refuses to fight. I'm going to miss this room. I can't afford it now that I'm out of work. There's no work to be had. - I'm going. - Where? We're stuck here. To join the forces of Free France? You're mad. You'll drown! We're drowning and suffocating here! Not in Saint Lucia Channel. - You're a woman, remember? - Precisely. There are women in the Free French Forces. They're fighting alongside the men. - As a nurse, you should come. - Don't be stupid! My parents are in Guadeloupe. They'd never get over it. You're suffering as much us, with Governor Sorin. That's true. The marines arrested my uncle just for holding a dance. Don't go. What'll become of me without you? I'll tell my brother to bring you some fish so you don't get too skinny. Still Fighting Life could be better! Here. Go queue up. There might be some bread. There'll be nothing as usual. Let's keep some. We can't fall out with the St-Clairs. We're dependent on them. When are you going to do some work? You want fish, you come fishing. To earn a pittance? I ain't interested. If you want some, go catch it yourself! That's it, go mess about with Augustin! It isn't Siméon's fault. The Admiral's starving us. What about the German, Dad? He prefers Nazis to blacks. The Admiral has always respected us. Come off it! He's replaced all the blacks with whites in the town halls. His policies are racist. It's a strategy. Mar is very smart and so is the admiral. He'll deal with the Germans when the time's right. Does St-Clair need a cleaner for the German? You want to work on the plantation? What choice do I have? Come on. That's what you want? I didn't pay for you to become a skivvy! And your diplomas? I need to work. Hyppolite can't feed a family. Make the slightest remark, and you're fired! I don't want to hear about you. - If the German complains... - Don't fret! I won't always be here. I know. It's me, Octave. Come in. Hello. I'm here to do the cleaning. Mr St-Clair sent me. Is it you I saw by the house, with your friends? Do you understand French? I speak and teach it. I'm a schoolteacher. I learnt your language in my house... before. My governess was French. Madame Cécile, a real Parisian. We say "at home". - I could give you lessons. - It won't be necessary. I'm going back to Berlin. - Shall I wash it? - Don't touch that! Tidy everything up in the kitchen. Idiot! That's my father! It's my most precious belonging. Leave it! It's looking good. I didn't find a gun. He knows me now. He'll let me in. Right... These two doors open onto the sea. Tomorrow we'll go in here. If he puts up a fight, we'll knock him out. Can you find a boat? We'll need some rope and a big knife too. I'm not going, OK? - But I'm willing to help. - Thanks, brother. Tomorrow 4pm at the German's. Don't let me down. What do I tell our parents? That I've gone to liberate France. They'll understand. Hey, nigger! I need some booze. You should've told me, boss. I need to organise. Give me a break! Just hand it over. Later, boss. Want a thrashing, do you? Siméon, I need you. We won't be late for Rose. We've got two hours. Those marines have nice life! We're dead bored since the Admiral banned rum. Marcel, it'll feel great to get hammered again. Money? What for? There's nothing to buy here. Let us help ourselves. That way, everyone's happy. Not seen, not caught. OK. Go on. Hurry up! Rose is expecting us. Quick! Siméon, hurry! You're ransacking us! What's the Admiral gonna eat? OK. Time we were off. To the Jerry's. Yeah, let's go see his skivvy! She's a looker. Siméon! Where are you going? Goodbye, sir. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Get off me! Get off! Don't shoot. On your knees! Don't shoot. Kneel! Siméon, stop! Please let him go! Don't shoot! Get lost! - Bloody nigger! - Get lost! Don't tell anyone. Promise me? Let's go. Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Why didn't you tell me? I didn't know they were going to the German's. They'll come back for you. Here. I'll be waiting for them! She isn't coming, Captain. Tomorrow maybe. Want to dance? I'm still waiting for my oil delivery. Next time you'll have to drink in the dark. We've run out. It's the blockade. What's the Admiral waiting for? For us to go out of business? Hey, play a Paris tune! Forgive me. - I should've protected you. - No. It was the marines' fault. You're not to blame. - You're allowed to be pretty. - Don't! Pretty and desirable. Be quiet, be quiet... Wait here. I won't be long. - Where's your son? - I don't know. Protecting a murderer? You son killed the quartermaster. He bled him like a pig. - He killed a white man. - How d'you know? That's impossible. You son's a criminal. Tell me where he is! He didn't do it! I've always supported Pétain. And marched past the Admiral! What a disgrace! You niggers are all the same. Cowards and liars. My war cross. Stamp on it! What's going on? You know something. - Yes you do! - No. See how they treat us? - Mum! - Clémence? - I'll fetch some water. - Clémence... There. One pill a day. Where'll we find these? The chemists are empty. I know. Maybe the military hospital. They still have supplies. I'll see what I can do. Here, Doctor. Thank you, Hyppolite. I've forgotten what it takes like. She mustn't work. She has to rest. I'll speak to Mr St-Clair. Be brave. Killing a French marine! How did Hyppolite raise you? Here. The medicine she needs. It's for her heart. I've better things to do! You've never helped Mum. It's time you got your memory back. Change your tone! You owe me respect. Get out! - Did anyone follow us? - No. I'm running away, I've no choice. Tell Mum I'm alive and I'm thinking of her. Kiss her for me. Be careful, they'll take it out on you. We'll survive. What? Aren't you pleased with my work? The marine who was killed... You know the murderer, don't you? He's your brother. I saw everything. Lieutenant Von Dem Borne, please. Come in. Captain Meyer, thank you for coming. Leave us. Go! I'm going to enjoy your hospitality longer than planned. My father cannot get me home before Christmas. Could you do something for me, Captain? I want to go back to Berlin. The murder weapon, Captain. You saw what happened? It's evidence. You must testify and hand over the weapon. Alright, but help me leave as soon as possible. I would if I could. Those damn English are blocking the convoys. - It's hopeless. - The French army... What bunch of useless cowards! Give it to me. Go on, arrest me! - I don't know where my brother is. - What did he do? You want the truth? Your men tried to rape me. He defended me. They wanted to kill him. - What would you have done? - I know. Your brother was attacked. Dietrich saw everything. You're working for him? I was dismissed. Dad's a fisherman. I had no choice! How does he treat you? Afraid he makes me sleep with him? The man who tried to rape me was a Frenchman. - What happened? - The bitch led us on. I want the truth. - Pierrot wanted to have her. - And the black boy? He attacked us. I didn't see him coming. Pierrot went berserk. He wanted to kill him. You're pathetic! Gentlemen, let's be off. How's the inquiry going, Master-at-Arms? I've found the culprit, Admiral. A Negro. He's on the run but we'll find him. The locals know the terrain better than we do, Blandin. I have my informers. - Is it a political crime? - Not at all. A crook who sold rum. It was over a woman. - A Negress. - I see. Captain Meyer knows her well. The marine tried to assault the woman. The brother intervened and things degenerated. They don't usually refuse. Mind the company you keep in future. It is not dignified. Only sailors behave like that! Take a white mistress. Who is my meeting with? A civilian? Saint-Clair, Mayor of Case-Navire. You appointed him to the council. I came here to warn you, Admiral, in the name of the Planters' Corporation. In Guadeloupe, they face the same problem. A labour shortage. The governor told me. It's catastrophic. We're losing workers daily. The sugarcane's rotting. - They're not joining the FFF? - Yes, sir. They're going in droves. And the others don't turn up for work. We can't send the police to drag them there! Why not get them to grow vegetables or other foodstuffs? That'll motivate them. Admiral, you can't simply end centuries of sugarcane cultivation. And we have sugar rotting in the warehouses here in Pointe-à-Pitre. The British won't let anything through. - I may have a solution. - Go ahead. In France, there's the STO. The youth are sent to work in Germany. - We could do the same here. - Go on. In the days of slavery, and even after their so-called emancipation, blacks were registered on the plantations. It was easy to control them. - They couldn't move freely. - A work register? What an excellent idea. Write a memo for my departments. Thank you, Admiral. Has your brother been arrested yet? The captain... seems to appreciate you. There's something I have to tell you. My brother and I had planned to hand you over to the British. I thought as much, seeing you snooping. Shame. Maybe they'd have exchanged me sooner. I should be with my comrades on the U-Boot. I'm a soldier. Are you spying on me? I haven't heard from my brother. I need a word. I've sorted things out for him. A gommier is leaving tonight with two marines. Dissidents? There are more and more. In the navy too. They're joining the British. They worship de Gaulle. - Why are you doing this? - Maybe I care about you. That's impossible. We don't agree about anything. Tell me you don't want me then. That way, it's clear. Take him with you. The coast's clear. See? Can we believe your captain? What if it's a trap? He could have arrested me. He's risking everything. He's just doing it to get you. So what if it saves your life? I'm afraid Blandin will find you and kill you. Just stay in Saint Lucia till it blows over. What? Rose, you wanted to fight for France! We have to fight this war. We'll win. I'm gonna fight and beat them. So long, pal. See you after the war. I'll wait for you, brother. Mum, you have to rest. Lie down. Where's Siméon? Tell me the truth. Where is he? Do you know where he is? Where were you last night? Where were you? Siméon has joined the FFF. - What? - Not him. It was the only solution. It'll be alright. It'll be alright. Get some rest. Did you put ideas into his head? Politics! Dad... Because of you, the war's taken my son. Did you spend the night in your chair again? I've been accused of negligence. They say it's my fault a man died on the U-Boot. But I wasn't to blame. The cannon exploded. A part was... faulty. It's me who should've died. Don't talk nonsense. Even my father thinks I'm a liar. I believe you. I believe you. They made it to St Lucia. I had confirmation. Thank you, Jacques. Rose, give me a chance. Citizens, patriots, do not allow yourselves... to be abused by the... Where did you get them? I queued all night for a hard Pétain loaf. What's your secret? ...by the propaganda... Go on, finish them. ...of Admiral Robert. You'll get arrested. At least I'm taking a stand, unlike others. I'm not a collaborator! I've not denounced anyone. You know what happened to my brother? Sorin had him thrown in jail for supporting de Gaulle. We've had no news since. Sorry, Denise. I'm talking nonsense. Vichy... Are you going to tell me how you got them? ...equals Jerries. Meyer! The captain? You saw him? And you didn't tell me. Don't tell me... And how was it? He's married. He hasn't seen his wife since '39. You love him! I've never felt that for anyone before. At the same time... we're so very different. You with an admiral's deputy! More and more marines are joining the Gaullists. - He knows. He's intelligent. - Want to convert him? Rose, you're playing with fire. It's the first time I've ever been happy. We get on well. But I keep telling myself I shouldn't, it's a bad idea... What to know what I think? It's a good idea! Actually, I've got a favour to ask. Your bedroom. Your bedroom. The real France... is de Gaulle. Admiral, my sources tell me the killer has got away. He is in Saint Lucia. Goddamn it! This island is like a sieve! - Change tactics at once! - Yes, sir. But I believe he had an accomplice. What are you implying? Captain Meyer is sleeping with the criminal's sister. I told you to end the affair! It is unworthy of an officer. They are serious accusations. From a man who failed and shifts the blame onto another. I want your word you'll never see her again. You disappoint me, Meyer. I cannot have you in the officers' mess. Blandin, find the culprits! We crack down on dissidents. Governor Sorin is right. We must punish the families. Yes, Admiral. If anything happens to her, you'll have me to answer to. - It's too risky. - You'd rather I lied? I've always been frank with you. De Gaulle is a soldier too. Sometimes you have to disobey. And join the British after Mers el-Kebir? Do you know they killed 1,200 French marines? Two of my best friends died. By the way, this is for your mother. The military doctor is an old friend. Thank you. Make me happy... stay here. Stop skivvying for the Jerry. You're jealous. - He's a decent man. - What are you talking about? He messed up a major operation. That's how he lost his leg. What do you mean? The man is a pretentious failure. He blew up the submarine's cannon. He'll be court-martialled. - How do you know? - A telegram from his father. Unless his old man gets him off the hook. I doubt he's keen to go back to Berlin. Look. Take a spoonful a day and you'll get better. How did you do it? Where did you get it? It was Octave. - Octave? - Yes. When he heard you were ill, he wanted to help. You see? He isn't as bad as you think. He has a good side. Thank God. Thank you. Senely. Your son has been stripped of his French nationality. He should become British! You can't strip him of his name. You are stripped of your rights and your pension. But he fought for France! Shut it, sailor's whore! Dad, drop it! Watch your daughter. He's a navy captain. One of Admiral Robert's men. He helped Siméon leave. Is he married? - Will he take care of you? - What matters is I love him. And he loves me. We're doing no harm. Shut up! You're talking nonsense. You're a disgrace! When I was 20, I was in love with Octave. I wouldn't listen to anyone. But he chose someone else and I ended up alone with you. I thought I wouldn't survive. But you made it, Mum. If it happens to me, I'll do the same. - You taught me. - That's true. I dreamt of a lovely church wedding. This captain... he'll leave one day. So? Must I stop loving? And living? Who for? It's my life, Mum. It's up to me. I'm coming! - Where's Hyppolite? - He didn't come home. No one's seen him. Where's his boat? What's happened to him? Can you take me to Fort-de-France? The neighbour will stay with you. I want to know if something's happened to Dad. We'll go to Denise's. I must see Meyer. Are you still seeing the captain? I've decided to leave. To join the FFF? To join Siméon? The rum-running's over. Keep this for me. I don't want you to hope... If I go to war, I'll think of you. If you have it, I'll feel protected. Is that stupid? Will you think of me? Can you give a letter to Siméon, if ever you see him? Thank you. My father's disappeared. I think he's done something foolish. I'm sure it's Blandin. Alright. Wait for me here. Stay in the house. I want names! The smugglers, your network... I want their names. Where did you get these British binoculars? Answer me! Let him think. We'll come back tonight. Where's Rose's father? You want to save him now? Wasn't the son enough? - Why arrest him? - For smuggling dissidents. - How is he? - They're strong, you know. Slavery was a good form of natural selection. And I plan to keep him alive as long as possible. Meyer, your Negress... Are you still screwing her? She's got you by the balls. Can't you see she's using you? You're screwing up your career. Dad... a dissident? That's impossible! Why didn't he tell me? I want to see him. No. It's too dangerous. We'll help him escape. You're insane. Blandin would be delighted. You're going to let Dad die? Choose your camp. He knew what he was doing. He took risks and lost. I cannot desert the Admiral. I'm an officer. That's it, think of your career! Stay in your privileged world. You're happy to benefit. That's what you want. For me to betray the Admiral. You've never loved me. Get out of here. GOVERNMENT HOUSE, MARCH 1943 You still believe in victory, after Stalingrad? Russia is launching a counter-offensive. It's a mistake to open another front. It's our first defeat, but we haven't lost the war. Is Rose still working for you? How is she? It'd be a lie to say she's well. But who is at present? This is for you, from Berlin. I'm not sure it's a good idea to give it to you. I'm used to bad news. Your submarine... No survivors. - I'll drive you. - No. You know, sometimes, it's far worse to survive. Only a soldier would understand. Come on, Dietrich. I insist. Look, Dietrich. Isn't it nice here? It's France. Honestly, why return to Berlin? Do you have friends there? People waiting for you? Mozart. It will do you good. Thank you. Come on, Dietrich, chin up. I'm going to rest. What is it? Are you alright? Fine. You may go. I don't need you any longer today. - You can't do that! - Why? You have to hope. You're young! I want to die like all the others. Think of your mother. Think of your father. And those waiting in Berlin. Giving a gun to a kid so he can kill himself... Is that the French army? - Is he hurt? - No. Fortunately I was there. What a bastard! It was Blandin. He did it to harm me. Dietrich is my responsibility. So I did you a favour. We're quits. You only have to say the word, Jacques. French Guiana is free. Valentino is in Guadeloupe organising the uprising. Many have died. What are you waiting for? I can't do it. You know I'm right. If only you'd forget all this. You're either with them or with me, Jacques. - We could've been happy. - In another world maybe. - Blandin! - What do you want, Meyer? What's wrong with you? Did your Negress put you in that state? You need help. Don't be stupid! No one duels anymore. You shoot people in the back! Stop, Meyer! Get lost. Get lost! You'll pay. Wait! Stay here! Breathe. Quick! Come in! I found it. Let's go. Rose Senely... Is she here? It's her day off, Captain. See? I'm still alive. So I see. Thank you. Please, Mademoiselle Rose. Eat. It's too dry. What do you want, Clémence? - To thank you for the medicine. - What medicine? Rose needs you. If you don't help, she's doomed. Do it for me, Octave. Even if you don't show it, you're proud of her. Why is she my only child to have succeeded? I hoped she'd never work on the plantation. Octave, it's wartime. It's a matter of life or death. But she's your flesh and blood. You can't abandon her. I'm risking my life for you. Come on, go in! Hurry up. My punishment... was seeing you and your mother every day. You were a pretty little girl. I never had the courage to leave. Besides, we're doomed to live together on this island. Us and all those who brought us here. It's our curse. FORT-DE-FRANCE, JUNE 24 1943 Hurry up. There are too many demonstrators. - We cannot contain them. - Dismissed. In Guadeloupe, Sorin will not last. There is still time to negotiate with de Gaulle. I shall not surrender. Not to a population that wants my head. The order remains in effect. Ready the cannons. Fire if necessary. It will be a massacre. Well-aimed shots will calm their revolutionary fervour. Firing on civilians is against my principles. Meyer, I was wrong about you. You lack stature. Lock him up. You'll be happy with the Negroes. Admiral! The field army commander. Put him on. Captain Tourtet, yes. Fire on the demonstrators. You have our support. What do you mean, no? You'll be court-martialled! Those cowards refuse to fire on civilians. - Let's use the ships' cannons. - No, it's too late. If we fire, they threaten to sink the fleet. The army will take revenge. They have always hated being under my command. Sir, you have to go. Your life's in danger. - Get me de Gaulle's envoy. - Right away, sir. The Admiral has gone. Martinique is free. Let's celebrate! - Octave. - Yes, boss? The sugar warehouses... I fear they'll be looted. Go to the harbour. Find men to guard them. Go at once. It's urgent. Take the car. - Why's she here? - She's my daughter. I'm taking her. Run! They've gone mad! Hang on, that's the Negress! Long live the Admiral and Pétain! Stop! We're done. Let's go. Forgive me. CASE-NAVIRE, JULY 1943 Today, July 14 1943, sees the Antilles' return to the Empire's community, united for France's liberation. You should know the indomitable France of the Resistance will be a France that is strong, tough, purged and attached to the Republic. But its law will be that of hard work and effort. France calls on the people of the Antilles to return to work forthwith. Work not done as slaves but undertaken as free men. I'll miss the sea. I won't see it from my cell. Goodbye, Mademoiselle Rose. Thank you. Good luck, Dietrich. Have you put on weight? Given our diet, you must be the only one. God! How long? 3 months. Does he know? - I don't want to see him. - I don't get it. Now he has rallied to de Gaulle, you refuse to speak to him. It's over between us. He's going to leave. He has his wife and daughter. He has the right to know. He isn't going to bring it up. The baby is mine. I'll take care of it on my own. Will you apply for a job in Guadeloupe? I can't wait to set sail again. To think we've spent 3 years here... I'm so sick of those blacks. Shut up! Dear Rose, I shall not forget you. I have returned home but everything seems shallow. Life has gone on without me. My only desire is to leave again. Marshal Leclerc is being sent to Indochina. I'm joining him. I left my heart in Fort-de-France. I discovered true love thanks to you, the love that knows no fear. To you, for always. See you tomorrow. Do your homework. Don't let me down. Go straight home now. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Miss, we'll do our homework! I've something to tell you. We were bombed. He was next to me. And then he was gone. He died a hero. He was always the first to help others. When the going got tough, we could count on him. What's her name? France. What will you do now? I don't know. Find a job. Settle down maybe. I've something for you. You brought me luck. It was the era of Admiral Robert, the time of Robert, a time of suffering and humiliation. We held our heads high and freed ourselves. But I cannot help thinking of all the young men who went off to fight, of those who never returned and of all the others... that France never recognised, or barely and so late. 4000 West Indians joined the FFF. Many lost their lives. France only recognised them as members of the Resistance in 2009. Dietrich Von Dem Borne was exchanged for a British prisoner. Robert was charged with collaboration in 1947 then pardoned in 1957. Some 1500 complaints of abuse were made against his regime. But only sixty sentences were pronounced. Subtitles: Eclair Media
