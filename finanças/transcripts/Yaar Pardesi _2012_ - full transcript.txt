Son, did you lose any teeth? Inspector, the boys who did this should be arresied. Sir.. First enlighten me, how did they get into this mess. And after they got thrashed, they should've come to me first. I would've gotten their medical done. I would've filed a HR. Don't blabber. You will get the medical report. Those boys should be arrested. Brother, we will get into trouble if this gets to the press. Television reporters hunt for such news. And what if Kuku gives a statement..

You are of marriageable age. All the relatives still taunt me that I sent you abroad, alone. Papa, I'm not saying that I don't want to get married. But I won't get married to a stranger. Mummy, why are you keeping quiet? Say something at least. Look, she has just come and you are already after her. And talk softly, what will Sahefs friend think of it? Why? Don't they get married in abroad? I was not in the favour of sending her. I send her only because you pressurised me. Now if she will go to Canada, she will go there only after marriage. Papa, but this is for sure that I won't get married in this manner. What did you say? Then get this straight as well. Now if you go to Canada you will go there" ...only after getting married to a boy of my choice. Otherwise forget about Canada Mr. Sidhu and his son are coming over tomorrow.

I need to repair these two cars by evening. Brother, try and understand. Two very beautiful girls have come to his house. That too from Canada Weasels, get lost from here. Girls these days are very smart. They first look at how much land he owns, what does he do.. ...what is his bank balance and both of you are useless. Jashn is educated but jobless. And Deep took five years to complete his graduation. I made sure I learn it well. And when I ask them to work they feel insulted. Listen, brother. Brother, listen to me. Look here. - Yes. Look carefully. This handsome face" Do you think we are born to work? We are born to rule. Yes. Kings of pauper land, get lost from here. Let me work. Forgive me. - How can we forgive you? You are our brother. - I am. You are our bro. - That I am. You are our nurturer. Our provider. Our car provider. - That too. Car? Sukhi. - No, we don't want to have te Get a hammer. Let's service them. Brother, get this straight. If you don't help us, we will hang ourselves here.. We will hang ourselves here. - Suicide. Get them a rope. - No. Cancel. Look Jagtar, Kuku is hungry and is hiding from his aunt. - Yes. We have to take him home. - Yes. And aunt's stuffed bread" - Stuffed with potatoes. Yes. With cumin seeds. - 'With coriander seeds. 'With buttermilk. A bowl of curd. - Yes. Sukhi, you remove the engine. I'll go do something for brothers and come back. Pacing won't help. Pacing won't help.. Now what will I tell Mr. Sicliu'? That our daughter ran away? Our Daughter had to run away because of the schemes you are up to. I say, tell me, where has she gone? Wherever she is. She is safe .. ...and her father own stood before her as an enemy. You tell me, what wrong did she do in going somewhere to save herself? Okay, so now I am her enemy. So affectionately I brought her up, educated her. I spent money in sending her abroad. And now she has become so independent. "That she doesn't like the boy selected by her 'lather. What would've happened if she would've met the boy once? I wonder where she ran away. It's so nice. Here friends have time for each other. In Canada, everyone is running after money. No one has time to spare. And here, everyone is sitting idle. - Yes. Jagtar and Jashn too were sitting idle. I gave them a job in my workshop. Your engine needs finetuning, I guess. Jagtar is a very good mechanic of our workshop. The head mechanic. And Jashn handles the accounts. And Deep has decided that he won't go to Canada. ...no matter how many proposals he gets from there. No. - He says his workshop is doing great. He is well settled. How can he leave? Right? - He can't. No.- No, he is right. - Of course. It's a practical thought. - True. He is right.- Yes.- Kuku, I didn't say so. No, you didn't say so,but this is what you mean. This is the central idea of what you said, right? - Of course. How can he leave his workshop and go? No, Jagtar can handle the worlcshopflight, Jagtar? No, I am your servant. What can a servant do without his employer? - Yes. Right. He's right. You know I, too, really wanted to go to Canada But after I went there I realised how hard one has to work there. How many times have I told Sahei to find a Canadian resident for me. But she doesn't. First find yourself a ]ob."Find me a girl." Sit down. - I don't wish to work. You guys.. Sorry. You guys wait till my cassette is released. I will make everyone eat out of my hand. Right, Deep? Even Jagtar gets marriage proposals from Canada But he doesn't want to get married and go to Canada Because he is Lord Hanuman's devotee. There is no tradition of getting married in his family. Oh, my God. Then how was Jagtar born? Valid question. What do I say about us? My family looks for stray kids. I don't undersiand, sir. How do I eat? I am feeling restless. I feel I cannot Kuku's case. Why? Has he become your senior? He has got a better promotion, sir. |G's son-in-law is the whole department's son-in-law. I am just a small inspector. Tell me, what should I do? Brother, I think he has lost his mind. My wife would know if Kuku gets engaged. Because Kuku's sister works in my wife's school. Kuku's sister's the one who is getting engaged. He is so stupid. Look at that, sir. To call a government officer fool is like calling the government fool. Really? So if anyone comes and tells you thatl am the SSP.. ...will you believe it? How can anyone say that? I will first enquire about it. Did you enquire about Kuku? No,I didn't. - Then go and do it. There the topic ends. Someone has eaten any my expense for the first tim e.. ...in my 25 years of service. And herel don't feel like eating anything. Now do you know how we feel when we feed you? My right palm was itching since morning. I was bound to suffer a loss. Come on. Go. Anna has come to India only because of me. Some Balbir Singh from Hardaspun. ...em otionally trapped Anna's sister and got married to her. And then he disappeared from there with all her money. And now we have found out that he is in Punjab. You didn't lodge a police complaint? We have lodged a report everywhere. Actually, there is no one by that name in that village. Strmge. My sister is in depression.She is in a bad state. You know we don't care about money. But he has cheated us. He has defamed us Puniabis.We should find the scoundrel. There are so many Balbir Singh in Punjab. Where will we find this person? And who knows whether he is dead or alive. - Yes. And if he has lied about his village" ...he must have lied about his name as yes. - Yes. How can someone do like that? All of you are so nice. But he? A cheat. Let's do one thing. There is a Sikh temple 50 lcilomelres from here. Let's go there and pray. A pray made from a true heart always comes true. Look, I have to testify for Nirm al's case tom orrow. We will go day after tomorrow. Mr. Kuku, each day is very precious for Anna We will go in our car. It's okay. Our old man won't let us take the car. Deelfs car? Yes, we will take my car. - Yes, of course. His father has left a lot for him. Scoundrel, the car belongs to your father? "| will get the car." It is after a long time that I've liked a girl. And she's from Canada! You are a celibate. You should try and undersiand my feelings. - Yes. So what shouldl do? - Why are you behaving like this? Look, be a brother and give us the car. Scoundrels, you saw a girl from Canada and both of you started drooling. Both? Hey, Jashn, man, why don't you go for the foreigner? Don't look towards Sahe]. Looking at my sister's state, I don't think the foreigner will suit me. That's leaves me with only one girl, Sahei. I think she is very smart. That means you won't go after her. Thank you, man. Now you are talking like a kid. You can only marry someone you love. Then think that I love her a lot. Love. You? You met the girl iusi once and you're in love with her? Why don't you say that you don't see the girl but the dollars? Why'? Love at first sight. And this is how love happens. - True. So, buddies,| am here,but is the car ready? Gary, my car has broken down. Jagtar is repairing my new car.It's not repaired as yet. Really? The car has broken down? - Yes. You were weaving your tales well. My car com es here for repairs. I know Jagtar since a long time. Right, Jagtar. You are my younger brother. - No, I am your brother. Jagtar, it would've been great if we could get a car. Becausel am asking Sahei to fix me up with the foreigner. If things work out, your brother's life will be made. Then you can do whatever you want,there won't be a problem? A lover boy? You too?

Otherwise how can a girl from a decent family.. ...go and live at someone else's house? What makes you think you are decent? You were making a deal involving your daughter. Sir, those who makes deals of their daughter aren't called decent. Sister, I tried explaining to him, our girl is smart. It is not right to force her like this. Shut up. I will slap you.You have defamed us. Sir, is this away to talk? She is your wife and not someone you have bought off the market. I dare you to touch her. Then see what I do to you. Look, this is our personal matter. You don't need to interfere. I have full intentions to interfere in this matter. If you have the courage then try messing with me. He says don't interfere. Why are you showing your teeth? What's wrong with my teeth? They all seem to be in their place. My aunt is the one who manages to pull outteelh well. She pulls them and places them in one's palm. Aunt has done so with more than the village. Sister, don't feel bad about what he says. Shut up. You too have started blabbering. Listen, if he ever raises his hand on you then tell me.

"When it thunders like dark cloud,my aunt's stick lashes out." "Dean." He acts brave. He has scared the whole family. Don't be afraid of him, dear. Anna - Yes. What did you ask God for? - What else? And thatl should get a chance to punish him. And what did you ask God for? What else could I ask for? I prayed to God for only one thing. That my dad should stop looking for weird boys for me. I will find one for myself. Nice. Sahe]. Yes? What kind of a boy do you like? Why should I tell you? VWII you find such a person for me? Or are you thinking about what are your chances? No, it's not so. - Why? Why isn't it so? What do you mean? Am I not beautiful? What kind of boys are you? There is such a nice girl standing before you. And you are not thinking about what are your chances with her. Jashn, you always stay quiet. You should say something sometimes at least. Yes, speak up. Well, a person needs to know where he siands even to flirt anyone. Look, Maan says, "Our status..' - Shut up. VWII we just keep standing here? Shall we go inside? Yes. Actually, I am starving. Just a minute. You guys go ahead,we will go visit the washroom. 0K5!- Come here. Come here. Come here. Thanks, man. You told her that you are not interested. When did I say that? - Over there. I was talking about my status. That's why.. that's why you don't progress. Now I will show you how to trap a girl. As if she is not a girl, but a fish which you can trap. Telling thetruth doesn't help at all. You should make girls emotional. Emotional. Fine. But all I know is that if 'lhere is no love". "Between the girl and the boy then nothing can happen. Okay, SageJashnpreet Singh. You find the girl you |ove.And stay here. I feel you have changed your mind about going to Canada, right? It hasn't changed. I will surely go if I fall in love with a Canadian girl. Hello, listen to me, don't eye Seine]. She is mytarget. Now should I get my eyes removed or get my ears oiled? You should know what you want. But Sahei is my target. Don't worry about me. By the way, all the best. Thank you. This way. That's done. Come, let's go. Hey, man. You okay? I'm okay. - You are alright? 'If Ilhy this noise'? What happened? Actually, I.. Just a minute. Actually, I was cleaning mytongle. Why? I have to talk to such a clean girl all day along.. 'Nhalewen. Oh, my God. Aunt it chewing wood. Stupid, it's edible branch, not wood. That's actually an edible toothbrush. Margosa tree's branch. And your mouth will be clean. Indian toothbrush. - Oh. Oh. Okay. - I'll get you one. I'll get you one. Anna, come with me Let's tour the village. Here's your Indian toothbrush, Anna And one for you also. - Thank you, brother. We will go have a tour of the village. Let's go. Be careful of the village dogs. Why'? Do your village's dogs bite outsiders? No, those dogs are very tame. Actually, a lot of people in our village act like dogs. What people are dogs? - You won't get it. Come, let's go. Well down. Keep drinking. You have made me so proud. Have some shame. You are smiling? I am being sarcastic. That's greaLbrother. What men you have. Useless guys. Tarsem, you should stay calm. Listen to me. If we buy the land around the highway" ...hen we can sell them to builders at inflated rates. Brother, the man and his land relationship get in our way. No, it won't. There are still many fools in this world. Only Kulcu is a tough nut to crack. I don't know who has trained him. Brother, why do you worry? Kuku's sister teaches in my wife's school. She is getting married on Sunday. I will be going there.| will talk to him over there. It's good if he agrees otherwise we will use our muscle. That ends to topic. - That's right. Hi! your (kink than. "The girl looked at me and stole my heart away."

We have come for \finnie's engagement. And you are talking about leaving. Listen to me. Do one thing, ask Kuku to meet me in the evening. But listen to me. Ask him to meet me in the evening. - But..

By the way, your friend Jashn sings very well. Kuku is right. Girls must be crazy about him. Right? What are you saying? He is from a very ordinary family. He sings at weddings and makes a living. But I had heard that he is good in studies. What's the use? No job. He doesn't have a job. He owns no piece of land. But he has principles like that of Mahatma Gandhi. Fine. Forget about JashmLets talk about you. Everyone has gone to have dinner. And you are still here. Come on. You too have dinner. - I have lost my appetite. Why? - I can't eat or sleep. Deep, did you consult a doctor? It's a bad thing. The doctor is standing before me. Who? Me? Good, you at least recognised it. Sahei, from the time I have seen you.. ...it's like someone has taken my sleep, hunger and thirst. Sahe], did you feel bad about what I said? We||.. Look, I am not a bad boy. Deep, I know you are a very nice boy. But, look, Deep, we can be very good friends. I am not talking about friendship. Try and understand me. You try and understand. We metiust a few days back. We hardly know each other. We have a lifetime to know each other. And, one falls in love at first sight, right'? I cannot say anything at the moment. Well, okay. I have said what I wanted to. If you want to take some time then do so. But, be careful, I shouldn't be another man to lose his love. Hey, what are you doing here? Everyone is having dinner. Let's go. Wow. It's so beautiful. Beautiful. So, what happened? - Anna, Navdeep says that he loves me. I never thought about it. And I never encouraged him either. He is not a bad boy. - Yes, he isn't. But one cannot decide on that basis. But the boys your dad is selecting are very bad. I know. Do one thing, select a boy and get married to him. And Deep is a good boy. Hey, then your dad can't do anything. And, moreover, Deep loves you. Shut up. I don't know whether he loves me or is it about going to Canada But.. your idea isn't bad. Anyway, soon or |ater,| have to get married. Then why should I delay it? I will think about Mr. Deep. Come, lefs go. - Let's go. Brother, my head is spinning. I saw Halina's sister dancing at a wedding. Brother, I think trouble has come knocking at our door. Did you confirm it was her or did you run away from a random foreigner? Brother, who will recognise her if not me'? I stayed with her in her sister's house for six months. If I don't recognise her will Uiagar recognise her? Sir, I can recognise someone from his fragrance. Sit down, I know you. There isn't much difference between you and a dog. Gall me a dog if you want,at least I am loyal. You shouldn't praise yourself at every opportunity you get. You shouldn't interfere when we are talking about something serious. Tarsem, control your angenLet me think of something. Listen, henceforth, you won't come before that foreigner. She won't stay here forever. Got it? - Okay, brother. I got it. Very good. I am having a lot of fun. You know, this is the first timel am sitting on a tractor. Kuku, tell me something,why didn't you get married? 'With any Indian girl or a foreigner? I'm sorry, Kuku.. ...if I've made you upset. - No. Everyone asks me this question. I should've got married five years ago. But perhaps God didn't want that to happen. You mean God? What does God have to do with your marriage? Anna, you are na6ve. In our country everything is done by God. When God didn't want meto get married,how could I get married? That's strange. Why can't you get married as you please? Aunt worries about you.Don't you care for her? Hear that? Why don't I care for her? Who do I have other than aunt? She has dedicated her life to us. Then make her worries go away. Get married. I can get married, Anna But there is a problem. What? - I will need a girl to get married to. And you need a girl who loves you. And you, too, should love her. And love happens just once, in your life. And once that passes by,it never comes back. You mean, you were in love with someone? What happened? I was in love. And perhaps,she too, loved me. I just couldn't say it out aloud. And I thought she would read it in my eyes. I couldn't gather courage to go and tell her. What? - I love you. But you just said it. I must've said it a thousand times behind her back. But I couldn't open my mouth when I was standing before her. Never. Now if you like any girl,you must say I love you. Any girl yearns to hear these words. Okay? You must say it out aloud. Out aloud. How loud? - I love you! Have you gone crazy? All the villagers will hear it. Hey, if that girl loves you, she too will say I.. - Softly. Softly. Love you. Fool. I think I wouldn't be able to gather courage this time as well. Otherwise, I would've said it right away. Crazy. You said something? No. I was saying, aunt must be waiting for us. Yes, let's go. Sahei and I have to go out as well. Sahei, should I talk? - No. Please. You go to the room, I'll comethere. You guys talk. Saheilll be in my room. - Okay. Was shetroubling you? She could've stayed here. Shut up. He keeps talking nonsense. You told her as well? She is my friend. We share things. They share things. You love doing this, don't you? You have defamed me. I know what excuses I have made to people. Does it look good, you staying at someone else's place like this? Viflll I ever think of something that isn't good for you? I won't let anything happen against her wishes. Refuse all the families you have spoken to. Tell them we have fixed her alliance. You interfered again? Have you forgotten this hand? Garmail, call Kuku's aunt. Mummy, I will call her right away. Son, what's the need for that? I was saying why we need to call her. It is our personal matter,we will resolve it. "Daddy, don't fight like this.Mummy has high contacis." Shut up. I wonder from where he was born. He is yours. I didn't bring him with me. Mummy, here, call aunt. - Give it to me. Look at that. He wishes to see his father get an earful. Daddy, we don't like embarrassing you either. We, too, are humans. We have brains. We aren't cattle that you are nurturing. Now I'll see how you go to lnder Kaur's house. I will break your legs if you do. If we don't reach there by 4:00pm ,aunt will come here. Daughter can lay their lives for their father's honour. I've heard this dialogue in a movie. Dear, your father's honour lies at your feet. Make sure you don't tarnish it. Which movie was it? - Keep quiet and sit there. Movie buff. Sahe], stay here. Your daddy doesn't like you staying there. Mummy, I will come back.l will get married as well. But the boy will be someone I like. Look at the result of sending her to Canada Enjoy the consequence. "The boy will be someone I like." Mummy,| know aboy. - I told you to keep quiet and sit tight. She will marry the boy I accept. I will marry after you give your acceptance. But he will be my choice. She is right. I wouldn't have married such an authoritarian" ...if someone would've asked me my choice. An authoritarian? What did you say? An authoritarian? I am an authoritarian? So, what have you decided, Sahei? I am so confused. Both the boys are good.They are different. Deep is very loud, outspoken.one has to ask him to keep quiet. And Jashn, you have to make him to talk to you. Deep believes in showing off. And Jashn never hides anything. I asked did you make a decision. It will take some time. But Sahe], both of them are close friends. There will be differences between them because of you. A friendship that falls apart because of a girl, isn't strong enough. You are a smart girl. - Thank you.| know that. I tell you, once girls enter a beauty parlour they can be thrown out.. "But they never come out willingly. By the way, we didn't tdce that long". "That you are making such a scene about it. You say you didn't take long but ask me. I am the one who was standing outside, waiting. Really? Welcome. I was waiting for you. Are we late? No, you are on time. Kuku said we are late. - When didl say so? That's what you meant. Be honest. Right, Vinnie? - You are right. Where is Sahei? She didn't come along? Sahei has gone out for lunch. Okay. - She must have had hers. Ours is getting cold inside. - Yes, please. Please come in. No, the land is very useless. Yes. Make the deal. - Brother. 400 acres. Don't worry about the money. I'll arrange for the money. - Broth er. Brother. Yes. Gall me in the evening. I'll give you all the information. Brother, listen to me. Just a minute. At least let me finish the conversation. I'll be finished by the time you finish this. Why? Are dogs behind you? Brother, one can survive a dog bite but not a bullet. She came home today. - What did you say? That foreigner came to your house? Did she see you? Brother, I wouldn't be standing here if she would've seen me. You would come enqJiring about me in central jail. Brother, do something. I don't understand how did he come to your house'? Wives have a bad habit of inviting people for lunch. They think people will say the lunch was very tasty. She told me not to go outside todaygguests are coming home. "There's a surprise for you." This is the surprise she gave me. She has given me a 440 volts shock. She has smoked me. Brother, you can still do something. Otherwise, both of us will get trapped. I will do something once you stop yelling. We are already in trouble and on top of that you are yelling. I'll have to make arrangements to send you abroad. That's right, brother. Send me abroad. Otherwise they will arrest me. Brother, I swear, my life will be made. I feel greedy when I see tasty food. And then I overeat. This is the result of overeating. You haven't eaten anything.You areiusi making noise. I love Indian food. You just lilcelndian food and not the Indian men'? I thought all Indians are like Balbir. My opinion was bad about Indian men. But, I found men like Kuku also. They are helpful and kind.And I changed my opinion. Anna, my brother is single. A bachelor. I know he is single. The one who will marry him will be very lucky. 'Anna, the one who marries you will also be very formnate.' What are you thinking about, Kuku? Nothing. What will I think about? Can I use the washroom? - Yeah, sure. That way, adjoining the bedroom. Where is Mr. Tarsem? He was here. I wonder where he has gone. His meetings don't let him sit at home. Hey. You? - What are you doing here? Sahei has called me here. Sahei has invited me as well. Come, let's go then. - Okay. You too come along. Hi, Sahe]. Hello, Sahe]. - Hello. Sahei, you didn't tell me that you have invited Jashn as well'? Well, I had called up both of you. Don't you both discuss things among yourselves? I thought you might have surely discussed about it. Yes. - No. - Yes.- No. I mean, we didn't meet yesterday. - Yes. Otherwise we share everything between us. - Yes. And the mobile network is also down most of the time nowadays. Isn't it? It's not possibleto talk. Yes. Okay, sit down. Or do you want to keep standing? Yes, yes, sure. Do you want to sit? Yes, sure. - Come, sit. Anna, I want to change your name from Anna to Anna Hazare. He is on hunger strike and you have taken an oath of silence. This girl didn't utter a single word on the way. She looks upset as if she is getting cramps in her stomach. Are you feeling alright? Yes, Kuku,| am okay. Hello, if you want to lie say it with confidence. This Kamaliit Singh Kuku, can catch a lie very easily. Tell me the truth. What's the matter? He is Tarsem Singh, why do you have his photograph? He is not Tarsem, he is Balbir. Anna, your eyes have become weak. He is Tarsem Singh, a very big businessmen. And you got the report in Canada that Balbir Singh is missing. Believe me, he is Bdbir. You are mistaken. And you only said that Balbir Singh wears turban. And he doesn't wear a turban. Then Balbir Singh and Tarsem Singh, how can be the same thing? Why don't you believe me? He is the same thug. Bring him before me just once. Am I lying'? No. No, Anna, you cannot lie. BuLburlii Tasan Singh is Baht Singh hem. ...| will definitely expose him. I promise you. The food was very tasty, isn't it? Yes. We have overeaten as the food was tasiy. No, I'll pay the bill. Oh, no. Jagtar, scoun.. Sorry. He took my wallet. Is it? And he didn't even keep it back. Do one thing, you pay the bill. Look it was my lunch treat. I'll pay you later. Deep, you very well know that the money.. ...my father sends me gets over by the 15th or 20th of the month. Right? So what's the date today? 24th. This Jagtar is taking undue advantage of our friendship. We have to teach him a lesson. You are absolutely right, Deep. Even though if your employee is your friend" ...he shouldn't forget that along with being a friend he is also a servant. Don't worry I'll pay the bill. As it is, I had invited both of you. Okay, fine. But I owe you guys a treat. And I don't like girls paying the bill. Why? Why can't girls pay the bill? Jashn, you tell me, havel done anything wrong by paying the bill? No, I don't feel so. As it is, I cannot afford the bill. Why do you worry when I am there? I am there. Okay, fine, I owe you for this bill. Sahe], I will pay you when I meet you nexttime. Shall we leave now? No, you both sit and think who will pay the bill nexttime. I'm leaving, bye-bye. - Bye. Stop. Stop. Stop the jeep. Stop, stop. Stop. Stop. Tell me one thing, you scoundrels, you want liquor before.. "And after the meals. This is not liquor, this is beer. He doesn't even knows this much. When did we drink before lunch? We cannot drink in front of Seine]. We have some self-respect. Okay, tell me one thing, when did I steal your wallet? Rascals, you both steal money from my pocket every day. Did I ever say anything to you? Did you tell him this? Listen, Tara You steal money from my wallet and.. ...now you call me Tara instead of Jagtar? Sorry, sorry. Very sorry. Sardar Jagtar Singh Hai. - Check. Listen, don't listen to Jashn. The quiet and silent types of people are very smart and cunning. When you know that Sahei is mine even then you went there. You went there without informing your friend. Why.' It's okay. - What "it's okay"? If the girl calls me how could I refuse and stay back. Scoundrel, you could have made some excuse and stayed back. She is going to be your sister-in-law in future. Stop dreaming of making her our sister-in-law. The girl has not even said it once. Listen, you did not go? You are questioning me? She is my girlfriend. - Alright. No, it's not alright. If he says that Katrina Kaifis my girl friend, would you believe it? Listen to me, I have told you so many times to stay away from girls. Once a girl comes into our lives our friendship falls apart. Look at this. You are wrong. Listen to me, if everybody worships Lord Hanuman.. ...then how will this universe move ahead? Man does not make the universe move it's the God who helps it move. After giving birth to four kids we say it's God's gift. It must be happening with guys like you, not us. I am going to relief myself. - Let's go. What are you saying, Kuku? It's good that you didn't speak with anybody else about this. Mr. Tarsem Singh is a respectable person. You are saying that he is Balbir Singh. I am very confident, sir.| am sure. Madam , the time period you are talking about. ...Tarsem Singh was in India at that time. He was working on a project near Bangalore. And his wife was in England for educational purposes. But Anna cannot make such a big mistake, Inspector. What do you mean? You just bring Tarseln Singh in front of me once. Madam, tomorrow if you say you suspect Amitabh Bachchan.. ...bring him to you. It's not how things work. You should have some evidence. Do you have Balbir Singh's photo? Do you have any? Strange, he lived with you for six months" ...and you don't even have his photograph? When you filed a report in Canada the embassy had sent his photo. But he was some other person. The way we feel that all the Japanese look dike". ...similarly,| feel she feels that all the men in turban look alike. Am I right? I don't know about that, Inspector" "but I feel all the policeman are alike. We will inform you if we get any information. We will call you up. We will be grateful you. - Yes. I was also wondering how my photo disappeared from the bedroom. No problem, it's just the photo. What will she do with the photo? That's okay, brother, but you please support me. Sir, you know it very well that I did everything" ...as per your instruciions. As per my instructions? Did I tell you to go and trap a foreigner? Your wife went to study and you trapped a foreigner. And what was the need for you to flee with her money? Brother, I.. - Shut up you rascal. We settled Dasonda's matter after you left. But you have ruined the whole matter after returning. Sir, what are your orders for me? Well, I don't give any information to anyone" ...but| can't help it, my kids are growing up. Their needs are also increasing. Stop laughing. Give him some money. Saw? Saw that? Sir has been so kind to me. But a pet dog never bites the family members. Hem ember one thing Uiagar Singh.. ...if1he dog acts crazy, its shot dead. But my experience says that if a mad dog bites anyone.. ...then the dog also dies. Good bye, and copy to all. Sir, this mad dog of yours will definitely bite us someday. She has come. Hello. - Hello. My servant told me that you have come. What a pleasant surprise! Please be seated. Yes. You too have a seat. Actually, we wanted to discuss a very important matter with you. That's why we have come to meet you. Okay, tell me, how I can help you. Well, actually, her sister has a problem. Yes, tell me. A married man from India had gone to Canada. He went there and got married to her sister. He stayed there for a short period and after that. ...he stole all her money and came back to India He went missing after coming here. Okay. But how can I help you in this matter? I am sure you must have lodged a report in the police station. Yes, we have lodged the complaint. And the fact is we have a slight doubt about who that person is. We just want to confirm it. The problem is that his wife is very nice. When we look at his wife we feel very sad. That's the confusion now, what should we do now. But is his wife aware about all this? No. No, she is not aware of anything. But whenever it is confirmed you please inform his wife. Such a man should be shot dead. Really, you mean that? Are you telling the truth? Yes, Anna, I'm telling thetruth. Such a man should be shot dead. You have relieved me from a great burden. Anna, I think we should move. Thank you so much. We are getting late. Let's go, Anna You please be seated. Have some tea Next time. We will leave. We shall take your leave now. Okay, thank you so much. Why don't you sit down? Your daughter is not going to come back" ...if you walk around like this. Okay, tell me, does it look nice to leave your own house.. "And go and live in somebody else's house? After all she is your daughter. She is stubborn like her father. She said that she will come only after she selects a boy. Are the boys found hanging on the trees in lnder Kaur's garden? Is she going to pluck one of them and bring home to us? Why didn't she see the boy the onel had selected for her? Leave aside the good or bad points of a boy selected by you.. ...when she came to know about the money marten. ...she refused to meet any of them. I'm sure you must have told about it. Otherwise how would she come to know about it? Sometimes I feel like giving two slaps to you and your son as well. Listen to me very carefully. If you ever raise your hand on me again.. ...you will get twice as payback. You will not be able to bear it. Why don't you leash me and tie me near the door? Give me food twice in a day. You have made me a dog in my own house. This man has done only bad deeds all his life. Now he says I have made him a dog. I really feel sorry for Ms. Hoopinder. She is such a nice lady and such unfortunate thing" ...is happening with her. For once I thought forget it, let bygones be bygones. But Kuku says, the culprit should be punished. He is absolutely right. Don't leave him. Do you understand? But we don't have any proof with us. You are helping me a lot. And I.. Hello, madam, no need to say thank you. As it is a Punjabi has cheated your sister. So it's the duty of all us Puniabis to help you. Do you follow? Okay, tell me one thing, have you taken any decision.. "About Deep and Jashn? I think Jashn, too, loves you. Strange, you see love in Jashn's eyes for me. But didn't you notice love for you in Kuku's eyes? I have, but Sahei, I might" What "| might"? He loved somebody else before. He couldn't get the one he love, he was heartbroken. And he still has not forgotten her. I cannot break his heart.| have to go back to my country. I belong to a different country. Hello madam,what are you talking about countries? You don't fall in love after seeing which couniry one belongs to. You just fall in love. That too without thinking and considering anything. I hope you understand me? Kuku is very nice and decent person. I just can't break his heart. Yes, if he is iilted in love for the second tim e.. ...he might not be able to bear this pain again. Sahe], slowly, my child. Look here, Anna Head this Get up. -Came|. It means get up in Punjabi. Get up. Get up? - You be seated. Camel. Camel. - Camel? Camel. - Yes. Yes, camel. - Camel. Hello, aunt. Hello. - Hi, Anna Hello. Hi, Sahe]. How come you are here? Jagtar dropped you here? Jagtar had some work, I took the bus and came here. You could have called me up. 'If Ilhy would you come to pick me up'? No, I would have also suggested you to come by bus. You are great. Okay, you have a cup of tea and I.. Anna Anna Anna - Yes, what happened? Keep all your papers ready we have to go and meet.. ...a very important person today. - Okay. It's very important. Okay. Keep all the papers ready. The doctor has comel will go and meet him. Okay, fine. I'll get tea for you, brother. You let it be. Aunt, you make tea for me. God save me from her te Be careful. Don't pop his eyes out. You keep the water boiling. I will make the te You are very dangerous. Come on. You are so mischievous. Broiher troubles me a lot. Hi. - Hi. The weather is good. - Yes. Well, if you don't like this cot, I will get another one for you. Please be seated. Sit down. - Okay. I feel you have liked this place. Your family members don't tell you anything? No, papa is very angry with me. But I can't leave my friend alone. As it is we are helping her so much. Tell me, whom are you going to meet today? One of my friends. He is a police inspector but he's suspended since the last six months. Punishment for being loyal and honest. So, do you also believe that the loyal and honest always get punished? That's what happens. People feel good about lies and fake and.. ...think that an honest person is a fool. So, despite knowing everything you also believe in the same thing. Why is it so'? Tea I didn't make the tea, brother, aunt has made it. Have it. I'm sorry, Jashn. If you don't want to tell then please don't. It's your wish. It's not like that, Sahei. I believe that a single truth is stronger than a thousand lies. As it is everybody knows everything about me. People made fun of me in the college. But I even met a few peoplewho didn't look at my background. They saw only me. And Kuku is one of them. Kuku is a very nice human-being. If he is doing so much for Anna, so he can help anybody. And whatever you are doing for Anna, only very few people can do that. Okay, stop talking about me. Shall I ask you something? Why don't you take up a job? I mean you should take up some job or do a business. Your parent's might look for a girl for marriage for you in future. The girl's family will ask what the boy is doing. What 'then? My mother is no more and my father is illiterate. He lived all his life as a live in son-in-law. A character everyone can joke about. I can never get married. What if a girl loves you and you also love her, not even then? You too areioking with me, the way everybody does. Jashn, I am not joking. I'm asking you seriously. If you love a girl and the girl also loves you. Not even then? Yes, I do love her. For the first time in my lifel saw a girl and felt liketalking with her. But I don't know what's in her heart. The day she says yes I'll not step back. Because that's my nature. Once if I go forward, I never go back off. Shall we leave, Jashn Singh? Anna, come, we are getting late now. Anna Yes, coming. Sahe], you were saying that you wanted to go home. So shall we drop you on the way? No, Gary is coming to pick me up. I'll come in 'lhe evening. Sure? Yes. Okay, then, we shall leave now. Come on. Bye. 'The day she says yes I'll not step back.' 'Because that's my nature. Once if I go forward, I don't back off.' Hello, Deep. - Hello. How are you, Sukhi? - Fine, brother. Go, get it. - I will. - Jagtar. Why'? 'What happened? He left early in the morning. Something is fishy. I have seen a lot of lover boys. I can see a glimpse of Han]ha's esirangem ent.. "And Mirza's sadness and MahiwaPs restless in his eyes. Scoundrel, you flunked Punjab literature in college. From where did you get these details? From where did you get the overhauling done? No overhauling, I am just laughing at these lovers' stupidity. Look, first Haniha got his ears pierced, renouncing material world. Then he grazed cattle for 12 years. But let see what our Haniha does. My boy, you too are after that girl. Brother, I am trying my luck. Let's see if I get lucky. Otherwise, I'll look for someone else, or someone else. Or someone else. I will find someone for myself. Just write nice dialogues for me. I want to recite them to Sahe]. Those dialogues were very good. But nowadays, it needs.. It needs to be up there. Up there. Here, hold this wrench. - A wrench? And go under the car. - Who? Me? No, your father. - Laali. Get our workshop's shirt. Here, wear it. - Brother, there are so many boys here. You can send anyone in there. My boy, don't you want me to write dialogues for you? - Yes. Don't you want to drink beer? - Yes. Get under it. Open the filter. That's it. This is how you blackmail me. That's why I don't come here. You make me do all the work. He was giving me a brief on Heer and Hanih You are making me, a celibate, write romantic dialogues. Brother, that's why I am making your write them. There's a lot offire in you. - Wait, you.. How are you, Jashn? - Strange. How did you know it is me? Shame on our friendship I can't recognise my friend's touch. We have been looking for you since morning. Then I thought that it's time for you to be here. You must be here. Forget it. Meet Kuku. Hello, brother. - Hello, brother. How are you? - Anna- She's here from Canada Hi. - Nice meeting you. Kuku, Jashn always talk about you when we meet. Kulcu is like this. Kuku is like 'lhat. Now I feel I know you very well. He also tells me about you quite often. That I got suspended? Forget all this. Firsi tell me, what you will have. I get half my salary. That's enough for me. I can afford it. - We will be having something today, brother. But what we want is your help. - My help? Suspended sub-inspector Viiay Singh Chauhan. Mr. Chauhan, when active officers can't help people.. ...suspended officers come to their rescue. Wiay, we really need your help. Now only you can guide us. God is the one who guides everyone. Still let me know what the problem is. Then I will seewhatl can do. No one can do anything. You saw? They left you alone and went somewhere" ...so late in the night because of that Wiay. Why should we feel scared in our own village? And then,| stay alone for many days at a stretch. I am not scared of anyone. Everyone is scared of me. Aunt, Viiay won't find anything. He was a sub-inspecionHe is suspended now. He drinks all daylong. And he fights with a new officer everyday. Actually, he has been bitten by a big of honesty. And you know how dangerous that can be. You mean a person should be dishonest, right? That's not what I mean. I mean one needs to be practical. Practical . Look, is it wrong to lie or make some adjustments" ...to get one's work done, right? You say that what I teach children at school is wrong. I shouldn't teach them to tell the truth. Saw that? This is what is wrong with girls. Aunt, they over-analyze everything that is said. Sahe], why did you start this with him? Now he just won't stop. He will keep bringing up different points. This is how he has always been. Sit herewith him. I'll go and get some hot milk. Aunt, first tell me, you are on my side, right? Aunt support the truth, got it? - Yes. - Keep quiet. Sit down. Hey.. By the way, Deep, thank you. You showed m e the way of how to stay in India What's great in that? This is how things wrong here. I will stay in India now. So,| should learn how the system works here. What did you say? You are not going back to Canada? No, life there is very hard. It's great over here. Even idle people enjoy life here. No, look, your parents have spent a lot of money on you. And you say you don't want to go back. It's not right. And life here isn't good, life in Canada is great. Forget it, Deep. You have a bad time working there. Here the onel marry will work and I will enjoy my life. Right, Vinnie? - Right, Sahei. L, too, have decided not to work after marriage. I will sit at home. He will earn. I will have fun. - Yes. Okay. Fine. I'll make a move now, aunt. Kuku will be here soon. He must be on his way back. No. Drink the milk before you leave. Actually, my stomach is upset. I am getting cramps. I won't be able to drink milk now. Fine. I'll make a move now. - Bye, Deep. Bye-bye. - Bye. Girls, what's wrong with him? He ran away all of a sudden. Aunt, now he will have loose motions. So, Mr. Ghauhan, this is the story. Now you tell us what we should do. Wiay, reputation of Puniabis is at stake. This means the key to this problem is with Uiagar Singh. But what should we do now? Let me think. Let me think. Look you need to use crooked means to solve crooked cases. I am sorry, Viiay. But Tarsem is Balbir. Don't worry. I know everything. Look, no rules apply on a suspended police officer. And then how can they suspend an already suspended officer? So, you go home and let me think over it. I will let you know when I need you guys. Okay? - Thank you, brother. Thank you very much. Enough. Enough. I need to go. I can't run anymore. And there is water over here. I know what you are talking about. Why don't you say that you are out of breath? - Yes. Your radiator has heated. - What is it? Go, continue running. It's so early in the morning.| am feeling cold. You know how cold it gets in Canada? Who is going to Canada? - Why? What happened? Sahei says that she doesn't want to go back to Canada What do you mean? Sahei isn't going back to Canada? No. She isn't. Hear him talk. As if he is engaged to her. Hello, she is impressed with me. - Really? - Yes. A little more effort by me and she will agree to get engaged. But what's the use now? She says she doesn't want to go to Canada She has spoilt my mood. Where are my dialogues? - Your dialogues? Here you go. You can. No. They might be useful to you. Hold this. - Do one thing, you keep them with you. They might come in handy some place else. I write my own dialogues. That's fine, but I don't understand one thing. What kind of a girl is Sahei? She came back from Canada and.. ...now she says she doesn't want to go back. It's hard to believe. It's like it happens in Punjabi movies. It's okay. It happens. Don't feel sad. Okay? I have to go for an interview. I am going there, see you in the evening. Idiot. Look, Sahei, parents are bound to worry about their children. It's not wrong for your father to worry about your marriage. He called me up. He said his daughter has come from Canada. ...and is staying at someone else's house. This is giving him a bad reputation. Okay, aunt. We will leave if you are tired of us. But still, I won't go to my house. Becausel know my father very well. Aunt, he is very stubborn. He does what he decides upon. You aren't any less stubborn. You are welcome to stay over here. I am happy that you guys are staying here. Look how happy Kuku is. He used to stay sad all daylong. Aunt, I know why Kuku used to stay sad earlier and.. ...why does he look happy now. Aunt, try and understand. Anna is the reason behind his happiness. Yes, this fear is troubling me as well. Talk to Kuku. Look, Anna has come from abroad. She will go back to her count-y. And Kulcu will once again be in the same state. Earlier as well he had used liquor to drown his sadness. That's it then, liquor was the only solution. But that's not a solution. I know, but it helps you forget things for a while. You know, when apatient is in pain.. "Doctor inject painkillers to kill the pain for awhile. So, liquor helps kill the pain in the heart for awhile. No. This is so wrong. It was your fault that you didn't tell her "| love you." Make sure to tell the girl you love her. How will you say it? Hey, look at me. Look here. Go,man. Hey, look here. I can't say it. - Then how will get any girl? How will she know that you love her? She doesn't know. You, too, will leave me some day. You said something? I said.. we are getling late. Let's go. We'll talk about it later. Kuku, you know what? You are impossible. If I ask him to get married, he refuses. L, too, thought why deceive any girl? And what's the use of 'the marriage if both of them stay unhappy? Anyway, forget about him. Tell me about yourself. What are you thinking about? Aunt, what's there for me to think? Hear that? What does that mean? You won't think of anything. You won't let your father think about it. Then what do you wish to do? Aunt, by the way, I like a boy. And I feel he, too, likes me. But papa won't agree for our alliance. Hey, leave that to me. Forget your father, I can convince his father as well. But aunt, grandpa passed away 10 years ago. Shut up. I mean it's my responsibility to convince your father. Tell me, who is that boy? I will tell you, aunt. I will tell you. But first, let me talk to him. 3:99'-. Where is Jagta“? - Brother, he must be under 'lhe ca'. I am here. How are you, man? Sorry, man. What is it? Why are you alone? Where's Deep? - Where will Deep go? What does a hunter dog do? Look for a pray. He will keep looking for a pray, you have a look at the car. It is giving jerks since yesterday. You are destined to get jerks all your life. Some jerks will be given by it as well. Sell this trash and buy a nice car. Listen, older the liquor the better it tastes. The older the friendship the better. Then why isn't it same with the car as well? Let me tell you. A new car is like a new girlfriend. As it gets older it starts troubling like an old girlfriend. Girls have to feature in all their conversations. These boys can't think about anything other than girls. Jagtar, relax, cool. Look, with great difficulty has our friend found love. You are say such things and making him homeless. He is the silent-type. He keeps his mouth shut when a girl is standing before him. What will he do? Look the silent-types like him are like a devil's tail. If you love the girl, get on the terrace, play the drums.. "And announce it to the world. Close the topic. He too? Who is he involved with? The one from Canada, Seine]. Forget it. She is a very tough nut to crack. Jagtar, you are surrounded by machines all daylong. You don't know what's happening outside. She is signalling him,that's why things are progressing. Oh I see. His alignment is already done. And here, the expert of cars has no clue about it. Look, Jagtar, don't tell anything to Deep as yet. Nothing is confirmed as yet. I feel Sahei too.. But.. but nothing is confirmed. It will affect our 'friendship. Jashn, a friendship that falls apart was not strong enough to begin with. Deep was after her because she was going to Canada- Yes. And now she isn't going to Canada She said so to test Deep. But.. but look, nothing is confirm ed, man. If it isn't confirmed then confirm it. Otherwise, give up everything and come with me to Hanumen temple. "| wi||.." - Sir, should I also get half empty bottle? Keep quiet. Keep quiet. My wife.. is a very religious woman. Very religious. No meat, chicken, fish, eggs, liquor is allowed inside the house. So, sir, you won't be going home tonight. Then will I be going to yours? No, I mean, sir, you have half a bottle of liquor.. ...and four chicken legs inside you. So how can you go to your house? Keep quiet. Keep quiet. Don't blabber. Take the bottle with you. - I don't drink, sir. Then give it to someone else. Don't argue with me. Sir, should I drive you home? I will drive it. I know how to drive it. Don't talk nonsense. "Click a photo of me dancing." "Click.. click a photo of me dancing." "Click a photon" "Click. "Click. "Click. "Click. Quietly drive the car. Drive it to a place I want you to. Viiay, you? You still crack such funny jokes. I am notioking. I am serious. And you know when I am serious. You are right. Anyway, I don'tlikeiokes. Drive. Okay. I will drive it. Answer it. Jashn. Your phone is ringing. Jashn, answer the phone. Hey.. 'Where is he'? Damn.. Listen to me. Meet me at the Royal restaurant at 11 o'clock. Got it? Listen, I want to tell you someihing very important. Don't tell anyone. And don't bring anyone along. Okay. - Bye. Sahei has asked you to meet her at Royal Castle. And she has also said not to tell anything to anyone. Shewants to discuss something very important with you. Hence I don't know that you have gone there. You didn't tell her that it's not Jashn, but Deep on the line? |would've said something if she would've given me a chance. She doesn't stop once she begins. By the way, what is this is about? And remember one thing, my friend. She isn't going back to Canada You are a schmuck. What did you say? I didn't get it. What's a shuck? Schmuck. It means Abuse me properly. Say, you.. What's the use if you have to use a dictionary to know what an abuse means? Anyway, all the best. Deep, tell me the truth, will you feel bad if I go meet her? People say that a friendship breaks if a girl comes in the middle. Oh, my noble schmuck. We are friends like in the movie 'Sholay'. We should even sing a song with that extra cart on the bike. Don't worry. I will come with you. No. She has asked not to bring anyone. She has, really? I said I will go with you, that means I will. Brother, Uiagar is missing since late night. Yes, his wife had come in the morning enquiring about his whereabouts. They said they found his car near the river. Brother, then you should ask the department. ...if any dead body has been washes ashore. By the way, brother, he won't commit suicide. There's a possible that someone must have murdered him.. ...and throw him in the river. It will be great if someone has taken care of him. Tarsem Singh, such people don't die so quickly. Really? They take time? I mean then we shouldn't be so happy about it. We have that issue with that foreigner. And you are saying that Uiagar won't die so easily. Brother, then, we should pray that someone should've taken care of him. Otherwise he would have troubled us. I don't understand one thing. Where is he? I can eat only once you untie my hands. The apple is not for eating" But for target practice. No, Wiay, don't. Brother. Brother. Tell me the truth. Who is Balbir? And how did he get a passport? Sir, it's been six since months since you practiced. Careful you might hit Uiagar Singh at the wrong place. No, Viiay. No. Tasem is BaMnTarsem is Bdbir. I made a false verification report and got his passport made. I did all this at Harnam Singh's behest I seized Dasvinder Singh's land as well. He was after Tarsem. Harnam Singh sent Tarsem to Canada After a few months we got Dasonda killed in an accident. Dalbir. - Sir. That's great. I hit right on target even after six months. I am worried. Place another apple. Why another one? I told you the truth about everyone. No, brother. No. If your hand shivers even a bit my children will become orphans. Even Dasonda Singh had children. You didn't feel any pity back then. Sir, Uiagar Singh's tank has leaked. Not just the tank, even the big drum. At least now let me go. Jashn.. - Sahe], I am not here to interfere. I am here just to say that my friend is very nice, honest and decent. He was also good in studies. Sooner or later he will get a very good job. You won't be able to find a better guy. He loves you a lot as well. - Can't he say all that? That's why I have force invited myself. If he could then what would've been the problem? Okay, I'll make a move now. Deep. Sorry, I lied to you. That I don't want to go to Canada I know. I am not that that as much as you think I am. I cameto know during Vinnie's engagement. "That I am dialling the wrong number. Fine. All the best I'll make a move. 'If I wouldn't have helped him today.' ...he would've never expressed his feeling to any girl.' 'It's okaywith me. if I didn't get her I'll get someone else.' 'Come on, Deep. Let's find a cure for the heart ache.' Couldn't you say all this? I could, but I had told you once I move forward, I can't back off. Now if your dad doesn't agree, you shouldn't back off either. That's what I wanted to see, how good you are at keeping promises. This is the first time I realised what love is. Now we will face whatever comes our way. "Listen, my beloved." "Yes, my love'? " "Let's go. - Where to" "A place different than all." "Where there's just you and me." "There shouldn't be anyone to spot us." "Far away from this world." "Far away from this world." "Let's make a different world for ourselves." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "My heart races." "But it fears sometimes as well." "My heart races." "But it fears sometimes as well." "That we might get separated." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "Yes, you and me." "One cannot attain love fearing the world." "Don't worry. Place your head on my chest and go to sleep." "Don't worry. Place your head on my chest and go to sleep." "My love. - Yes, dear?" "Listen to me, my love. - What is it, dear?" "This world is evil. "This world is evil. "Let's save our love from it. "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "Yes, you and me." "My love, I am your heartbeat, you are my heart." "My love, I have dedicated my life to you." "My love, I have dedicated my life to you." "Don't fear, my dear." "Don't break my heart." "Hold my heart, my dear." "Don't ever shy away." "My dear, you love me?" "My heart now belongs to my beloved." "My life has become musical." "Let's add fragrance to flowers." "Let's add fragrance to flowers." "Come let's sing love songs." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "You and me." "Yes, you and me." "Yes, you and me." "Yes, you and me." That's great. What you did is amazing. - Thank you, sir. Sir, you can take whatever action you want. Sir. Wait. Turn around. Why are you staring at me? Well done. I reinstate both of you with imm edi ate effect. Report me in your complete uniform within 5 minutes. You began this case, hence you will end it. Sir. Aunt, where's Anna? Anna? Anna? Why are you shouting? What happened? Where is Anna? Anna? - Anna is here. What happened? Where is Anna? Anna! Why are you going there? She is on the terrace with Sahe]. Anna! Anna! Anna! Yes! Anna!

I want to say someihing to you. Say it, Kuku. Anna, well, I wanted to say" Tell me. Why are you hesitating? I wanted to say that we are getting late. We should go meet Tarsem. Let's go. Take me along. Why are you standing? Please have a seat. No, madam. We cannot sit today. Why? What is it? Why are you in such a hurry? Why are you looking at each other? Tell me, what is it? What should we say, ma'am? We are speechless. Look, please, I am getting worried. I will know about it only when you tell me. Look, Hoopinder, I'm really sorry. I am very sorry to break this news to you. Tell me, what is it? ls Tarsem alright? Tarsem is alright. What will happen to him? Actually, ma'am , the other day we had come to you". ...to tell you that someone had betrayed Anna's sister.. ...and came back to India - Yes,| know. We have confirmed the identity of that person. Now we need to decide his fate. Fine, but what can I do in 'that? Now whatever can be done can only be done by you, ma'am. Because.. I'm sorry to say that person is none other than.. Tarsem . Ma'am. Madam, when you had gone to UK for your education" "behind your back Tarsem has gone to Canada on a fake passport. He went there and got married to Anna's sister. And when he came to know that his enemies in India are dead" ...Tarsem deceived her, took all her money and came back to India Madam .. Is your decision still the same? My decision.. Is still the same. But where is Tarsem? What? Did you hear it properly? Broth er.. Did you make sure of it? Hang up now. Another problem has cropped up. What happened, brother? ls Uiagar dead? Such people don't die quickly. Really? - What are you doing here? Hun. Wiay has been reinstated. He will be here any moment. - And you, brother? What brother? Whose brother? - Don't do that, brother. I will die alone in prison. Come with me. I will take you with me. Nothing doing. Hun away. I have political immunity. Nothing will happen to me. Brother, what you did was not right. You have ruined me. I will pay back for this. I will take your name. Those who take my name die. Go away. What you did was not right, brother. Hoopi. Hoopi. Where are you? Hoopi. Hoopi, pack a few things quickly. We have to leave. Hurry up. - Why? Where are we going? You women will never stop questioning. I'll tell you that later. Take Pinky and hurry up. We don't have much time. Be back in a minute. Neither will I go anywhere, not will I let you go anywhere. This is no time to ioke. It's a real pistol, you will shoot it accidentally. Give it to me. No. No, Hoopinder. I forgive him for your and Pinky's sake. But I won't forgive him. He has deceived not one but two women. Look, Hoopi, for God's sake, don't take Pinky away from me. I will tell you about these foreigners. They are characterless. They get married a number offimes. Shut up. Their character is better than yours. She is still forgiving you.

You stayed in someone's house for a month. Didn't you feel any shame? Now you have brought this useless guy here. His father lived off his father-in-law. And now he is here to do the same. Stop it.

Am I wrong? A brother shouldn't stay in his sister's house. And a son-in-law shouldn't stay at his wife's house. A smart person always checks the breed of the dog before taking it in.

And he has asked you to open this packet only after you reach Canada Tell Kuku that I'll miss him a lot. 'God, why does Kuku get his heart broken time and again?'
