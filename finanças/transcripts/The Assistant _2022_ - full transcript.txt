182. Get up! SRI KAJANG PRISON Okay, get ready. I'll hold it. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I'll hold it. One, two, three. Okay. WHEN DAD COMES BACK MOM, ME, DAD Assalamu alaikum. What do you want? I was walking outside and I heard someone screaming. That's why I came to see if everything is okay. I'm okay. Are you sure? You don't look okay. Do you want me to call the police? No need. I'm okay. Are you sure you're okay? This... is my house Your house? There seems like a lot you have to fix up. Here's the thing. You screamed so loud just now. Your neighbors would've called the police for sure. You're right. Feroz. Zafik. I'm leaving now. What do you want? You came out at last, Zafik! What are you doing here? Living like a gangster. Come on. For years, you used to say, "When I get out of here, I want to look for my daughter. I want to spend time with her until I die." You would say the same thing every day. What happened? She's all grown up now. She has her own life. I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? If you knew what I did to her and her mom when she was younger... But she's still a good girl. Every month, I would get money from her. - As long as I... - Don't bother her? You guessed it. Remember, people are not always what they seem. What we call family, maybe it's better not to have one. It's easy for you to say. I'm sorry, Zafik. That's not what I meant. I'm sorry. It's okay, Kuan. You do what you have to do. I'm just looking for the people who did this to my family. He has to pay for this. Joining me today is Dato' Sam Lee, the CEO of Golden Lion Group. How is it? Are my clothes okay? You cannot be serious. It's stylish, isn't it? It is, for an old man. If you want your own clothes, look for a job and buy them yourself. Maybe you can share what the causes are. Well, it's interesting that you mention the two things. Do you know what causes crime? - What do you think, sir? - Poverty. People are getting poorer - and more desperate. - Dato' Sam Lee, a big shot in this area. And that's why there are snatch cases, scams, thefts, and so on. - So be it. - And now... Zafik. Did you sleep well last night? How could I sleep well on the sofa? What did you put in the cushions? Stones? It's me. We didn't do so well this quarter. Zafik. Where did you go? I sent my driver to pick you up when I heard you were getting out. Did he miss you? No, I wanted to be alone. No worries. The most important thing now is that you're here. Sam. Or do you want me to call you Dato' Sam now? Come on. Sir, you have an appointment at 3 p.m. It's fine to delay it. Zafik, this is Sofia. Her role here is "a personal assistant." But don't be fooled, she's the one in charge. Okay, we need to have at least a round of drinks, come. Do you remember Mr. Seng? The offer I told you ten years ago? I'm telling you, seriously. Mr. Seng controls all the development projects in this city. So by default, I control half of it. And even then, there's no limit. You know, right? We're trying to develop this area. I did see you talking about it on television. How did I look on television? You're still charming, just like before. More nonsense. Why are you so formal with me? I'm looking for work. Looking for work? What work are you looking for? Just come and work with me. It's okay, Sam. I appreciate your offer. But I want to make my livelihood legally. If you want to mix, that's fine too. Just water. Thank you. Sir, I'll take my leave. Sit. What's not legal here? I noticed your guys out there. I've seen what they do. No, here's what it is... You have a lot of influence now, right? I want you to find out who killed Lisa and Zikri. I thought it was something else. Zafik. It has been eight years. They are my family, Sam. I tried looking for those bastards everywhere. I tried everything. And I even paid the police to investigate. I tried for months and the result was the same. I'm sorry, my friend. Everyone gave me the same answer. "Maybe this is the work of addicts looking for money to get high." At least you tried. Thank you, Sam. That's what gives me the drive. Yes, I admit. I'm like a criminal. But I use the money to make this place better. I want to make sure what happened to Lisa and Zikri won't happen to anyone else. After all that, I went back to your house. I thought these things might be important to you. I thought I lost them. Don't forget. You are my closest friend. Sweetheart, are you okay in there? I'm worried about you. I'm okay, baby. I'm okay. Don't give up. I promise I will get out of here. No touching. Zikri. Zikri, you are the head of the family now. You have to take care of your mom. You have to make sure your mom is safe, okay? Okay, Dad. Buddy. I don't know how to tell you this. Lisa and Zikri are dead. What are you saying, Sam? I don't even know, I received a call from the police. When I arrived, I saw them taking the bodies away. What bodies, Sam? What are you saying, Sam? What happened to Lisa and Zikri, Sam? I don't know. Why didn't you take care of them, Sam? You said you'd look out for them! You're a liar! You're lying to me, aren't you? They're still alive, right? They are still alive, right? Why are you lying to me? - I want to see Lisa! - Calm down. - I want to see Lisa! - Calm down. This idiot. Help! Somebody killed himself! Come quick! Help! Zafik. What are you doing? Why are you awake? I heard a voice. Sorry, I woke you. Zafik, let me give you some advice. Let go of what's in the past. It can kill us. The faster I die, the better, Kuan. Don't say that. My family died because of me, Kuan. I squatted in the prison. I couldn't protect them. I only had one responsibility, to be a dad and a husband, but I couldn't even do that. How many times do I have to tell you? You have too many clothes. You want to buy all the clothes, pants, and skirts you see. Do you think money falls from the sky? Darling, why is it so difficult? We can discuss it first, okay? What is there to discuss? I've scolded you many times. Why is it so difficult? Our neighbor has asked for his money back. Do you have the money? Tell him I'll pay at the end of the month, okay? Our bills are piling up. What are you going to do? Don't worry, I will settle it. It's like this every time. You just leave. You're asking me too many questions! You're giving me a headache, you know? Where are you heading? I'm just going home, sir. Going home? Where's home? A little further in. Sir. What's that, sir? - That's not mine, sir! - That's enough. - Sir! - Zafik bin Zainudin. You are found guilty on the charge of trafficking drugs and hereby sentenced to ten years in jail. I'm innocent, Your Honor! Your Honor, I'm innocent! Silence! No! Silence! Your Honor! Dear! We meet again, buddy. Sorry, do I know you? Remember at your house? When you broke all those things? I must've looked like a crazy person then. Sometimes, we have to be crazy to release stress. Look at you now. You look all right. I'm not that okay. I'm looking for a job. I still can't get any. Nothing at all? There is a friend who wants to help. But I'm not sure if I want his help. Here's my advice. You should take up your friend's offer because it's so hard to get a job nowadays. Right? You don't want to be jobless. Thank you for your advice. I'm Feroz. Zafik, right? I'm going now. Take care. I'm so tired. Where do I get a massage tonight? Tell him the payment will be on time. But when it's time, we have to adjust the rates for... I changed my mind. I had to close your bank account. I sent your porn search history to your boss. You want to cheat on me? Take that! - Miss, I'm looking... - Stop whining already. And so am I, bastard. Stupid fellow troubles me always. Miss, I'm looking... I'm looking for a new phone. How about this? Was it a bad breakup? It was worse for that guy! Remember, every piece of information on the Internet can be found by somebody who knows how. Do you know how? Go and ask my stupid ex-boyfriend. Having a girlfriend who knows computers is a dangerous thing. Hi, Dad. Hello. Mr. Kavan. Yes, and you are? Do you know my dad? I have a message from our friend. You owe him money. Were you gambling again, Dad? Didn't you promise to stop? Please give me more time. I will pay. One week, okay? Don't hit me. You should be afraid of me, not him! - How many times do I need to tell you? - Yes, you've told me. - See what has happened now! - I'm getting tired of this. - I keep repeating myself to you. - I'm getting tired of this. My goodness! Enough! Nobody can hurt anybody else here except for me, understand? Mr. Kavan, I give you a week. - Thank you. - What? And you're banned from gambling for six months. - Thank you. - What? Remember. You have to pay your debt. I'm taking this one as an interest. One week, remember that. Look at what you've done now. Where am I going to look for the money now? - You're always causing trouble. - I don't know what to do. - I don't know what to do. - You are spoiling everything. Give me more time, dude! I can't give you more time. You promised today, so you have to pay today. Say it, Kuan. I can feel you judging me. Are you sure about this job? There aren't a lot of jobs for ex-convicts. This is making it hard. Hey, wait a moment. Besides, Sam is my friend. He has a lot of influence. It will be easier for me to investigate the case of my wife and son. Do you know about the murder of these two? I don't know. That was why I took it on. Are there drug addicts in the area? I'm not sure. You really don't know? Hey, wait. People say there's a building here. Addicts gather there. You can try looking there. Hey, boss. Give me some money. No way, go on. You think you're so great. Go away. Go away now. Dato' Sam. You're late. What are you doing here? Especially since you're carrying a lot of cash. You're joking. I don't want to do this anymore. You're spending my money. What you want isn't important. Zafik is already working for you. What else do you want? This friend of mine has his own principle. To him, there's no free lunch. what is he up to? You were so cocky just now wanting to take out your gun. Hey, count me in. You got bashed pretty bad tonight. You're always following me around. Who are you, asshole? There's a lot of money in here. You're lucky I'm around. I'm Lisa's cousin. We grew up together in Bintulu. Nonsense. Lisa used to be more tanned. Her voice was like a duck. And she used to run and complain to her mom. And we used to get scolded. Her mom loved her very much. And vice versa. After you were locked up for two years, I came here. Because I found out my cousin and your son got murdered. I'm steaming, buddy. I want revenge because they're my family. I still don't believe you. The bald one is me. I've investigated this case for months. To rely on the police... I can solve it myself, but you have a right to help me. If you want them to get what they deserve, my address is on the back. Bye. Zafik. Who were you talking to? No one. Hey, you're crazy. What's going on? Hey, you... What are you looking for? He was right. Hey, buddy. You said you would make sure he gets what he deserves? MOTHER AND SON MURDERED BY A MAN, BUT THE MURDERER HAS NOT BEEN FOUND MOTHER AND SON VICIOUSLY MURDERED AT THEIR HOME, MOTHER AND SON FOUND What's all this? I found this guy near your housing area. He's a Peeping Tom, you know? He recorded many videos for hours. That's why he was afraid of giving it to the police. Give what to the police? What's this? But that night, he went out. Was he the one who did it? It's not him. When he got to the place, they were already murdered. But he made it in time to record the video. He gave you all the footage just like that? Don't laugh. - Don't! - Don't laugh. - Don't! - Smile! What are you laughing at? Yes, pretty much. That's the guy. But you can't really see his face. It would help if we had someone who knows IT. I know who can help us. My dad is not here. I'm not here to see your dad. Do you want to help settle all your dad's debts? I need to ask you a favor. Hey, how far are you willing to sacrifice? What do you mean? For Lisa and Zikri. I'm willing to die for them. That's not enough. Is there anything worse than death? This is pretty enough. What are you doing? You're killing my vibe. to die is easy. To kill is also easy. To kill is like tearing away a piece of your soul. The question now is, are you willing? Hey, you wait here, okay? - What? - Wait here. Okay, sure. Hi, are you alone? Look at your sales right now. Look at it and tell me what you see. It dropped, didn't it? How did it get like this? This week's. Any problems? I cannot imagine it. You haul this money everywhere. I didn't know you cared. I'm just worried you'll lose it. Don't worry. I don't do the work alone. I have an assistant. I want to see him. The important thing is you get your money. Why do you care? I heard you've been asking around about your wife and child. That's my business. You listen here, Zafik. Dato' Sam paid you to collect for him. So you don't need to dig up the past. Understood? Zafik. It's me. I've checked the file you gave me and done what I could. Do you want me to go there and get the file? No need. I just sent it to you. Check your phone. That's it, right? My dad's debt is finished, right? That was our deal, wasn't it? Maybe this is the work of addicts looking for money to get high. Go away now. I think I know this guy. Do you know him? He looks familiar. I bumped into him before I got ambushed. He asked me for money. But when he saw my face, he panicked and left. That's the addict. Where can I find him? So powerful. Hey. If you're scared, you can wait here. Hey, do you want some? - No, I don't want any. - Jeez. Honey, can you stop now? What are you looking at? Move aside! I'm already late! Jeez! Move it! Darling. Boss, sorry, I'm late. Hey, move aside. I need to count the money. You're in my way. People need to count money. Bravo! What do you want? This is off-limits. Get lost. Isn't this place a bit below your standard? What should we do? That's the risk of my job. Come in. Dato' Sam is not happy with you. You should just report if Zafik talked to anybody. Is somebody helping him collect the money? I don't know. He goes to work for you guys, then he comes back here. So where is he now? Do you want your favorite tea? I have some. Who do you think your boss is? This flat and your weekly allowance can be gone just like that. If Dato' Sam wants to plug your livelihood, he can do it anytime. I don't need his money. I cannot imagine what Zafik would say if he knew that you've been spying on him. You are a helpless old man. Your daughter won't even acknowledge you as her father. And now, you're about to lose your only friend. Get out. Do your job. If not, I will be back. Two hundred. Two hundred. Two hundred. Feroz. What's your name? Ah Huat. What do you want? What's this? We have a few questions to ask. Is that okay? "We"? Yes, "we." What's the problem? You missed school, didn't you? Eight years ago, you killed a woman and a child. Remember? Are you crazy? I haven't killed anyone! I saw your face, asshole! Hey, relax. Let me try. Ah Huat. You're an addict. You would do anything to get high. But the problem is nothing went missing from the house. What are you saying? It's so hard to talk to this guy. Okay, it's like this. Who do you work for? Who hired you to kill? I've never killed anyone. You don't know me? Do you know who they are? They're my wife and son, damn you! Hey, what are you doing? Feroz, I think we have a problem. Relax, I'm here. He's Rodney's guy. You're going to die. I know who you are. I didn't kill them. I only put the stuff in your car. So you're the reason Zafik went to jail? Someone made trouble! What's this? Why did you push him? Do it harder. What are we going to do now? We'll go look for Rodney. Only three guys? Good hit. - Let's go. - Hang on. Just leave him. Okay, let's go. Let's go. King Kong. Lend me your axe. You hide in the back. Let me handle this. Amazing! You can't be moved. You can be moved after all. Zafik! I surrender! How dare you! Who are you? Are you stupid? Do you know who this place belongs to? I'm so sorry. We didn't know. Next time, shoot first. Are you Rodney? I'm not Rodney. My name is Desmond, okay? Desmond. I see, Desmond. Did that addict Ah Huat work for Rodney? I don't know that addict, okay? But this is Rodney's place. He's the owner. Then the money... Just take it. Take it! Hey. I'm not finished yet. Can you call Rodney now? You don't understand. I can't call him. He doesn't care about this business at all. I cannot call him. With what we've done to this place, you still cannot call him? You don't understand. He only cares about the money. He won't care at all even if I die. I don't understand, you say? If that's the case, open the door. Open the door now! Can you? What's inside? He'll slaughter me. He'll slaughter you later. But I will surely slaughter you now. Which do you prefer? Quickly. You're smart. Go on. You, you, and you, get lost. What do we do now? I have a plan. Please don't kill me! I don't want to die, please! Come here. Come on. Don't be afraid, come. Fire? You're in trouble now. Now, you can call Rodney, right? Hey! You are crazy. You don't want to mess with Rodney. He's crazy, he'll kill all of you! You are requested to stand in silence. Where's my money? It's not me. That guy went crazy and he... So all my money is gone? Then I have no use for you. I have no use for you! Where did you learn to shoot like that? While you were sleeping. Who are you? Good evening, Rodney. How are you doing? What do you want? I'm only a person who wants to speak to you. May I? Zafik, move! Hey! Slow down! Do you understand the concept of a chase? Damn! What's wrong with you? You're so noisy. Go ahead, shoot. I don't know how. That's why I'm shooting. I got him. You're crazy. Is he dead yet? I think not. Let's ask. Hi, Rodney. Remember the guy from just now? I'm that guy. What are you doing sleeping here at this time? Do you know who I am? Do you know who I work for? You're dead. He's the one who's about to die, right? Right? Hey. I know you. You're that stupid kid who went to prison, right? Terrence told me about you. You don't know who you're messing with. Terrence, is it? That's all I wanted to know. What are you doing? Why do you have so many questions? Can't you see? He knew me. I wanted him to tell us what he knew. Relax, Zafik. It's the 21st century. Sorry. I'm just going to check your body. A knife. Awesome. This is sharp. Here. Take it. What are you looking for? A lot of things have changed while you were away, you know? But everything about you is on this phone. What kind of gangster posts things on the Internet? Right? He's so stupid. Look at this. Look at this. Did he tag this guy? "Terrence Shenton." We meet at last. I know him. He was the prosecutor in my case. What's his connection to Lisa? We'll ask when we meet him, okay? No. I'm done. You bulldoze every place. You kill as you please. You laugh about it. You're crazy. You're the one who wanted to know everything. I want to find the person who killed my family. One person, one! It's the same whether you kill one or many. It's still a sin. Go to hell! I'm going. What's this? Do you want to stop? We can't stop as long as everyone involved is still alive. Do you understand me? Remember this. Got it? Let me check this Terrence guy's address. I will contact you, okay? Zafik Go home and get some sleep. Hey! Pay the rent tomorrow. I was just meeting someone. Kuan, you scared me. I'm worried about you, Zafik. You don't need to worry, I'm okay. What's okay? Nothing is okay. I... I don't do things like this anymore, okay? Do you think I'm afraid that you would kill yourself? I'm afraid you would be like before when you were in prison. You're free now, you know? It's not like before. I'm going to wash up. We'll continue tomorrow. What? You have no idea who did it? What do I pay you for? Sir. What? You have a guest. Mr. Seng. Why were you shouting? That's not good in front of the guys. Sofia. Give us a little room for a man-to-man talk. I'll be on standby outside in case you need anything. Thank you, Sofia. How did you get his home address? How do I stop you from asking so many questions? It doesn't make sense. I don't understand what's his connection to an addict and a gangster. When we see him, we can ask him, okay? As the proverb says, "When you hire someone, you do not suspect him." Don't. - Nice. - Don't. You built this palace in your own world and you think you're the king? Mr. Seng, I promise that... I'm not done talking. Don't forget. The things you own today are all given by me. Because you promised to look after my business. But now? Millions are burnt, but I don't mind. We can earn back the money. But... what do I do about my tarnished reputation? I don't care how you do it. By next week, I want to see a human head on my table. Don't forget. You can be replaced by anyone. Sir, this is not my fault. He's like an animal, you know? He just came in and broke people's bones. He burned all your money, sir. This is all Rodney's fault, sir. Right, I've already reminded him. I've told him that this place needs tighter security. Look at this door, it's useless. Anyone can... Did he ask about anything else? He asked about Rodney. And he said another name, I don't know who that person was. Ah Huat. Who is Ah Huat? I don't know Ah Huat. I only know one kind of Ah Huat if you reverse it. Huat ah! But sir, if you gave me a chance to be the boss of this place. You and I and this place will be huat ah... You opened the door easily. But I agree with you. The security at this place is not tight enough. But... to let someone like you watch over it, it definitely won't be safe. If the choice was between his head and mine, I'd prefer his head. Understood, sir. What's this? Who are you? We've killed many people, you know? As a prosecutor, I would like to inform you. The accused cannot ask any questions. He can only answer questions. Isn't that right, Your Honor? What do you know about the murder of my wife and son? What murder? I'm a lawyer, you know? Damn you. I'm sorry, Your Honor. Do you think you can just break the law just because you're a lawyer? You got the wrong guy. Who hired you? Rodney? Who's Rodney? What nonsense is this? Who hired the addict to kill my family? I don't know. Look. - You still don't understand? - No. This weapon was found in the accused's car, Your Honor. Do you recognize this? You'd better speak now or else... But I will make sure you talk. There's no need to do this. Hey. If you've got no balls, get lost. At last, it's just the two of us, darling. Kuan. It's me. You were right. I shouldn't have done all this. But it's too late. It's not too late. No one can force you. The choice is still in your hands, Zafik. I feel like I have no choice. You do. Kuan? Kuan? Was that him? He said it was the wrong number. Dato' Sam gave me instructions. Don't force me to do this. Just tell me what I want to know and we'll go. You get to live. Do you know what's the most important thing to a man? Family. Right or wrong, good or bad, ultimately, they're family. Listen. You've been dead to me for a long time. And if you still don't want to open your mouth, you will die a sad old man. Zafik's family is no more. But he's still fighting for them. That's why I respect and support what he's doing. Please! Please don't! It hurts! You're in pain? Do you want me to call the doctor? - Do you want to go to the hospital? - Help! You should tell me. I don't know. If you don't tell me, it's fine. I will ask your daughter and your grandchild. Don't hurt them. Then speak! Kuan, we have to go! Kuan! Kuan! Kuan! Kuan! Kuan. What happened? Sir. The old man refuses to open his mouth. I've handled it. Are you okay? Terrence's wife just called. They found his body. So Zafik knows everything? - Devi. - Zafik? Devi, you and your dad have to get away from here. What are you... If they find out you helped me with the video, they will come looking for you. But I already gave you the old man's address. And you said it's all settled. What address? Wait, did you speak to Feroz? Which Feroz? You asked me to find the address. I don't understand, what's this? One moment, you are so nice. One moment, you are so rude. Are you crazy? Devi, I don't understand what you are saying. Hey, you're really crazy. So I have to edit the video and make it clearer. - That's it, right? - That's it. What are you still doing here? Our transaction is over, right? We are over when I say we're over. Look for this guy's address. Hi, you still haven't got it? How are you here? You did all this? No, not me. He did it. He knows about you. And he knows what you did to Ah Huat. Hey, open your eyes. We have a few questions to ask. Is that okay? "We"? Yes, "we." What's the problem? You missed school, didn't you? But you're Lisa's cousin, right? The photo you gave the other day... I took that photo from your box. And then I gave it back to you, understood? I want to see Lisa! Sometimes, people can go a bit crazy. There's too much anger within you. This idiot. Help! Somebody killed himself! Zafik! Zafik, wake up. Hang in there, Zafik. But you need that vengeful feeling. You need justice. But you won't find it yourself. You need support. You need me. I'm here. What's up? You're dead! Hit him! What's going on? Stand aside! Get up! What are you doing? Silence! You definitely have courage. But... you need skills and use this. Who do I learn the skill from? From me. Come on. I was the head of a gang. I'm proficient in weaponry and CQB. But? But I never used my brain. I robbed a bank and failed, so I ended up here. If you want to punch properly, you have to have a stable stance. From your hip to your shoulders, then to your target. Remember, a powerful punch needs to come from the shoulders. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Shoulders, hit. Sir. That is not mine, sir. - That's not mine, sir! - That's enough. Sir, that is not mine! - Sir, I don't have anything like that! - Enough. Be quiet! This evidence was found in the suspect's car. The suspect can't deny it. His fingerprint was found on the evidence. Your Honor, that's not mine! That's not mine! Your Honor, I don't own such things! Your Honor, that's not mine! That's not mine, Your Honor. Come on, Zafik. You're about to get it. That's it? Every time you get to sleep, every time you can close your eyes, that's when I come out to play. Sometimes, we have to be crazy to release stress. Hey! Pay the rent tomorrow. I was just meeting someone. He paid Terrence off to submit false evidence. He's the one who murdered your family, you know? Rodney. No. Rodney was just a lackey. The one we're looking for is the head of the snake. At last, it's just the two of us, darling. Speak! And when my dirty work is over, that's when you return. You know who's in the video, right? Do you know who killed your family? Or do you want me to tell you? Then speak! Golden Lion Group... Sam asked me to do it. Sam. Sam. What's your problem, Zafik? I gave you a job because I wanted you to start a new life. Why didn't you just forget it all? You want me to forget? You made me go to prison. You murdered my wife and son. You want me to forget? Because she wouldn't listen. What are you saying? It's all because of you! It's because of your integrity and your morals that keep you from working for Mr. Seng. That's why you're poor, buddy. You couldn't even pay your bills. You couldn't even feed your kid, right? I liked Lisa too. I truly don't understand why she picked you over me. I'm better than you in every aspect. But it's fine. We're good friends. What's wrong with you today? We have fought for hours. Can't we settle this thing tomorrow? I need an answer from you today. You're stressing me out! Hey, where are you going? You want answers, right? I'm going to find them! Let's go. I've heard things about Mr. Seng for a long time. My friend who works with his guys is also rich now. Now, he's asking me to work under him. Try to imagine. Let's be rich together, buddy. Okay, he wants to see me tomorrow. So if you're on... That's not my way. I don't want to find money that way. Hey, don't reject it first. This is a golden opportunity. I don't want to earn this illegal livelihood for Lisa and Zikri. I will postpone my meeting. - So you can consider it properly... - Sam! I'm a mess right now. There's a lot on my mind. Understood. Thank you for giving me this opportunity, Mr. Seng. I promise not to disappoint you. I invited a friend of mine to join me, but he is slightly lacking in foresight. I only need you, not your friend. I see. I don't want anyone to know of my existence. Settle him. Mr. Seng wants me to destroy you because he doesn't want you to know his plans. That's why we shouldn't trust an addict to keep our stuff. But he saved you from the noose. Ten years in prison. You were lucky. Here are his fingerprints. I told Lisa everything. I told her that she would be happier if she chose me. But she was stubborn. She didn't listen, like you. Why are you doing this to me? - Why are you doing this to my family? - Lisa, listen. It's okay. Zafik is no longer here. I can look after you. You know I've liked you for a long time, right? - What's this, Sam? - Lisa. Sam! Sam! Sam! Zikri! Zikri! Zikri! Zikri! Zikri, get up! Zikri! Zikri! Wake up! Zikri! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa, listen... Lisa. Lisa... That part was unintentional. But after you got out of prison, I was so ready to take care of you. But you treated me like shit that you flung back to my face. Do you think after everything you've done, you can wash your hands of it? Why, Sam? Why me? Why my family? Why us? It all comes down to luck. I came to say goodbye. We're good friends, aren't we? Sam! Sam! Let me go. Sam. Hey, bastard! Damn you! What's this? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Feroz, help me! What can I do? I don't want to die either. Can you go faster? Are you okay, Jas? Your face looks weird. It's heavy, idiot. Okay, go and get the car. I'll get the plastic. Clean him up a little. I don't want his blood in the car. Your cheek has a hole in it. Does it hurt? I guess it's not that painful. Let's finish this. Hey, this is better. Where? Where is he? Behind the pillar. Shoot him! Shoot! Hey, go and check. There are a lot of people here. Relax, I'm here. Yan! Yan, are you okay? Just nice. Mine is long. Lend me the short one. All clear. Seriously, Kuan. My gosh. I see, a sharpshooter. Fourteen. What now? Come on, it's a woman. Now. Do you want my "gun"? I'm so scared. So fierce. I promise I will delete it, okay? Hold me. Hit me again. You are so cute. I'm not Zafik, bitch. I'm Feroz. Come. Woman, I'll shoot you. Did you kill Kuan? That old man was useless. He should die. You can fight? Did you train in prison? You're an animal. Come on. Is one bullet enough to settle our problem? Buddy. Usually, I would ask you to just shoot him. But this bastard has no manners. Why don't we teach him a lesson? Don't be afraid, buddy. I'm here, okay? Let's go. That hurts, birdbrain. You definitely can kick. Let's go, one more. What are you doing? Let me. Then what am I doing now? I want to thrash him. What do you think I was doing? So? Shut up. He got you. I scared you, didn't I? This is sharp, you know? Sorry. I already told you, I'm better than you. You're still in the mood to laugh? Send my regards to Lisa, okay? It all comes down to luck, buddy. You were the one who said it. It all comes down to luck. We should have stuck to our plan and shot first. Right? Zafik. The king is dead. This is our chance, buddy. What chance? You think I do all this for fun, Zafik? You think I'm just your slave? I'm your fantasy. I'm your desire, Zafik. Right? I have talents you don't have. But why did you interrupt me when I was busy just now? I don't want to be you. Zafik... It's okay if you don't want it. Let me take over. I will do my best for both of us. What do you think? You don't exist, Feroz. You only live in my head. I created you. Do you realize? I did all of these, you know? No. This... I did it. You did it? I did, damn you! Now, who's crazy? Give up, man. As long as I don't give up, you cannot win. Bastard! Let's see if you die or not. Why don't you die this time? I don't even know what will happen. Let's try it. It won't hurt. Well, just a little bit. Damn you! Die, damn you. Dad. Good. You had your revenge. So? We're dead. You should accept it. You think revenge means anything? We are still dead. Well done, Zafik. You are useless. You're awake? You're so great. For years, I built an empire for Sam. But... you destroy it in a flash. I respect you. And I like people with mental intelligence and talent. My doctor says you're okay now. Can you speak? I understand. You did all that for your wife and son. You got your revenge, right? What if I offer you the CEO position at Golden Lion Group? Together, we can control this city. Business is still business. Smart. That's a smart choice. I hear you have many names. Feroz. Zafik. Tonight, who are you? Zafik. Good guy. Weak. He can't even protect his family. Feroz. He's wild like a beast. He settles everything with violence. He is the one you asked Sam to destroy ten years ago. And tonight, I'm Yasmin. THE END
