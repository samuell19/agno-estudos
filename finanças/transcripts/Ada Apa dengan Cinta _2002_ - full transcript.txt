-I'm leaving. -We're going up. Bye. Cinta. Milly. Are you looking at boys? Ms. Cinta. It's a poem. Where should I put it? You can put it inside, sir. ANNOUNCEMENT ANNUAL POETRY WRITING COMPETITION DEADLINE: TODAY Gosh, Alya! I don't want to talk about it. Why don't you want to talk about it? DIARY Do you remember what we wrote in this book? IMPORTANT NOTES "The problem of one of us is the problem of all of us. The enemy of one of us is the enemy of all of us." But my dad fought with my mom, Cinta, not with me. But you often end up as the victim like this. How can I explain this to all of you? You can choose to believe me or not. When he's furious, my dad will be unaware of his surroundings. But after that, he will cry like a toddler. He will be so remorseful. He will kiss my mom's feet and hug me. Fine, Alya. But just so you know... our friendship is also very important. This book is our witness. If you have a problem, talk to us. Don't keep it to yourself. Just call me. I'll accompany you anytime. I'll always pick up the phone. You can talk to me. You can come to my house at any hour. I'll always open the door. Okay? Okay, Alya? I'm your best friend. Am I right? That's right, Alya. Okay. That's enough about me. Let's talk about something else. Do you want to listen to my poem for the competition? -Let's hear it. -Give me the guitar. -Your new poem? -Yes. Here. I hope you'll enjoy it. Because it's about the five of us. The title is "I Want to Be Together Forever." When this shoot grows, seems like the body is rooted. Each breath taken is a word. Dreams, voices, and emotions join together in a cloak of unity. Our hands are entwined, our tongues are united. Thus every word said is a queen's command. Outside is sand. Outside is dust. The wind will blow them and take them away. But we will continue to dance. A dance that only we know. Our souls are like stretchers, so just sit down. And we will carry everything. Because we are one. That's awesome, Cinta. -You'll win. -Thanks to all of you. -Does this mean you like it? -It's amazing. Hey, do you remember our last dance? Yes, to this song! Alya, come on. -Don't be like that! -I'll just watch. Fine. But you'll join us later. -Do you still remember? -Of course. -Of course. -Let's go. Hurry. -Five, six, seven, eight. -Five, six, seven, eight. -One, two, three, four. -One, two, three, four. Dear students. The goal of this poetry writing competition which we held annually is to remind us of the one of a kind treasure that is so priceless and that's the Indonesian language. -Cinta, you'll win. I'm sure of it. -Yes. And... the team of judges headed by Taufik Bagaskoro Sahid, or myself. I love you, Mr. Taufik! This time we have decided that the winner is... -Cinta can do it! -Cinta! -Cinta! -Cinta! -Cinta! -Cinta! -Cinta! -Please calm down for a while. And the winner is... Rangga. A 12th grade Science student from class A. Please come to the stage. Rangga. Mr. Taufik is looking for you. He wants to give you a prize because your poem won the competition. I didn't participate in the competition. Well, then... The emcee will receive the prize. It's the poem that was put up in my room. Since no one has ever seen it, I just sent it to the committee. And it won, Rangga. I don't care. But it's true. By the way, are we still going to the concert or not? -Sure! -Of course. Why not? I can't wait to buy new clothes. Who knows that Yuki might see me. You're insane. Please, Maura, be realistic. Please, Maura. You look so serious while reading the winner's poem. -Damn it. -Is his poem very good? Amazing. If it's not a plagiarized work. What's that? Milly, please. It means taking other people's work as yours. But isn't that stealing? No. It's only an if. I said, "If." But I feel rather offended by this person. If he really can write like this, why has he never sent his work for our wall magazine? Which means he doesn't appreciate our wall magazine. So what's your plan? If he's a jerk. Let me face him. -Cool. -Okay. The most important thing is to meet him as soon as possible. Then we do an interview with him. Hey, it's noisy! You're too serious! Just ignore him. What a jerk! Rangga! What is it? You're Rangga, right? I want to congratulate you. For what? For being the winner of this year's poetry competition. I didn't even participate in the competition, much less win it. Excuse me. But I'm reading. I'm not done talking yet! I just threw a pen at someone because he made too much noise here. I don't want to throw it at my own face because I'm talking to you. I just need to talk with you for a while. Fine. Let's do it outside. Why? Can't we just do it here? Fine, but be quick. What do you want? An interview for the wall magazine. What for? We need your profile as the winner of this year's competition. I told you that I didn't participate. Suit yourself! But according to the judges, you're the winner. Great. Then, go do an interview with the judges! -What do you mean? -Weren't my words clear enough? So you refuse to do an interview? Correct. Jackass! Acting like a superstar! I'm better off doing an interview with Duta from Sheila on Seven or Dewa's Once. Gosh! What an annoying guy! What's wrong? Write this, Milly. The guy named Rangga, is a person who is... very arrogant! A big headed jerk! The kind of guy that we need to stay away from! Write that in our diary! In the diary? -Where else? -Sure. -What did he do to you? -Did he touch you? God forbid that he should ever touch me! Cinta, you should take a deep breath, so you can speak clearly. I'm so pissed! He acted like a star! Who are we talking about? Listen to me, I think he has no feelings. Acted like he didn't care. As if he was a famous poet. So arrogant. I'm sure he has no friends! No social life. What did he say to you? He refused to do an interview! He said he wasn't the winner. And told me to do an interview with the judges! How dare he? Which one is the guy? I'll punch him now. No, you can't do that. He will feel important. Oh, I know now. It's about the winner of the poetry competition, right? -Milly. -What's his name? -Rangga. His name is Rangga. -Yes. So, there will be no interview with the winner? -I'm here to submit-- -What? Cinta. Have you listened to the song that I requested for you? Yes. Thank you. Yes. I want to submit a short story for the wall magazine. Okay. Can you get out now? We're having an important meeting. -Okay? -Okay. -But please put this on the wall magazine. -Of course. -Cinta, please read it later! -Get out! What now? Do we confront him as a group? Why are you back again? Like a... Like what? What is it? Sorry for disturbing. I just want to ask, are we still on for this afternoon? I'll call you this afternoon. DIARY Cinta? Are you still upset? I guess so. I don't know. He was so annoying. I never met anyone like that. Even his face is unpleasant. You know, he has a dog-eared book! I'm sure he just carries it around to look smart. Yes, I hear you. No, I'm fine. It seems that you have a problem. When I come home there's no food. Don't you have an appointment with Borne? Okay. If you talk too long with me, you won't have enough time to prepare. Okay? You should take good care of the children! If mom asks where I went, tell her I went to the mall. Bye! Hey, Cinta. Let's go straight to the cinema. The movie is about to start. So, after that, we will still have enough time to hang out. What is it? Is it okay if we don't watch a movie? But are we still going? Yes, but not to watch a movie. Is that all right? -Don't you like automotives? -Why? I'm looking for material for the wall magazine. You'll be bored. I'll be back. -Yes. -We don't have it. Karmen! So you won't forget. Can we talk for a while? No? What's the problem? Let's talk outside. -What is it? -What does this mean? You read my letter? I thought you only read important reading material. Like literary works. What's wrong with you? Were you offended because I refused the interview? Fine, you can do the interview now. Don't be a spoiled brat! How dare you call me a spoiled brat? Now you want to do an interview? It's too late. The magazine will be published soon. Look at that guy. So annoying. Look at the way he acts. But you still need to interview him, right? I'd rather not. Fine. It's easy. Just ask for his profile from the admin or his homeroom teacher. That's it. Let's do it now. Fine. Let's go. Man, what are you looking for? Did you see it? I only know comic books. Why were you so late today? I don't know! Madam On Time, why are you always late recently? Right. Isn't the "late riser" title mine? Please, don't take it from me! Why are you laughing? Are you angry that I stole your title? I don't know. Lately, I have trouble sleeping. Why? I think I need a new decoration for my room. Besides, I read Chairil Anwar's work yesterday. He said something like this. "I have trouble sleeping. People talk, dogs bark. The world fades away." It fits with me and my condition, right? It must be cool to be able to make words like that. -I'm serious. -Me too. You should eat. The meatballs are tasty. You're right. I'm hungry. -The meatballs are tasty. -Order another bowl for me. What did she mean with "dogs bark" or something? Why did she ask me about Chairil Anwar? What's this? I don't know. Found it! You treat the book as if you've found a pretty girl. RANGGA, WHEN EMOTION TRUMPS LOGIC, THE CONS BEAT THE PROS. AM I RIGHT? FROM: CINTA Cinta! You called me? Why? Are you looking for another argument? No. I want to thank you. I looked for this everywhere. It's a rare book. So? So... -Why are you smiling? -So what? That's all. Thank you. You're nicer when you are confused. -You should stay confused. -"You"? Yes, "you." You usually say "hey." Stop it. -By the way, where did you buy it? -This one. At a flea market. You won't find it in big bookstores. Previously, I got it straight from its publisher. So... You have one too? Yes. Do you like it? Very much. Especially at the end, when Chairil felt like walking on sand. And he felt like there was a figure beside him? Yes and he said to himself, "I didn't mean to share fate, -fate is each person's smile." -"Fate is each person's smile." Too bad Sjumand Djaya has already passed away. Hey, if you like Chairil Anwar's works and other poems, I know a bookstore that sells them. Really, where is it? -In Kwitang. -Oh, Kwitang. I always want to go there, but never had a time. I'm going there this afternoon. Don't be mistaken, I'm not asking you to come with me. You can come if you want and it's okay if you don't. No. I'm also not expecting you to ask me on a date. Yes, I wanted to make sure so you wouldn't misunderstand. This afternoon? We'll see. Hey, Rangga! -Am I dreaming? -What's wrong? -It's weird to see you bring a girl. -It's nothing. Cinta, meet Limbong. He's the tycoon of the used books. Cinta. -The literature section is over there. -Go on. Did you find the book? Yes, she found it. Just like a romance novel from the seventies. From books to a Saturday night. Rangga, here. This is what you're looking for. Why are you looking for this book? Are you going there? Okay! Where is Cinta? I don't know. The band is about to begin their performance. Hey, everyone! What is Nobita doing here? I have this. The CD booklet, so we can take a peek. Are you also going to sing? Of course! Hey, where is Cinta? Gosh! What's wrong? Damn! I forgot that I have a plan with the girls to go to Pas's concert today. Without you, the band will still be there. Don't be like that. I promised the girls to go a long time ago. Are you going to watch it because you want to, or because you feel bad for your friends? Both. I'm leaving, okay? Like you don't have individuality. Excuse me? Watch a concert together, go home together. Go to school together. Isn't that sacrificing your individuality for something less principal? -On the contrary, it is very principal. -Really? Why should I talk to you? You don't even have any friends. At least I don't rely on anyone. Fine then. You should go after your friends. Can you go home by yourself? What do you mean? Well, girls like you shouldn't walk alone in a place like this. Girls like me? What do you mean? I shouldn't waste my time on you! Rangga. You're so stupid, Rangga! Don't take a girls' anger seriously. No! It's just a tactic to make you take initiative. You should chase her! Just watch her. If she looks back, it means that she wants you to chase her. Watch carefully! See that! Go on, chase her! Be a man. Go on! She didn't mean it. Go on! Hurry up! How could you? You're a man! -When did you arrive? -Didn't we come together? Stop joking! No. I was late. May I sleep here, Cinta? What's wrong, Alya? As usual. I ran away before getting hit. You need to take this problem seriously. You should talk to your mom. It's useless. I have talked about this with her so many times. The possibility of living apart from my dad. But my mom only ended up getting angry at me. She told me that I didn't try to understand, that I was selfish. I don't understand. How could she still love my dad who keeps hitting her and me everyday... Our house is a mess, destroyed. You should see it. Why didn't you tell me? If there's something wrong, you should tell me. All this time, you've helped so much. I don't want to be a burden to you. You're not a burden. Do you have any plans? No, why? -Borne won't visit you? -You're insane! If I let him visit me on a Saturday night he will assume that he's my boyfriend. Cinta, are you making a song from Rangga's poem? I don't understand him. And he really upsets me. I only need to spend a little time with him to become spiteful. You mean you were with him? Are you accusing me of going out with him? Why are you feeling accused? Yes, I'm not sure. So, you went out with Rangga? Just for a while and it's only to look for material for the wall magazine. Really, it was just once. And I had no other choice. Whatever. But you went out with him, right? It wasn't a date! Please don't tell Maura, also Karmen and Milly. Cinta. You don't need to keep secrets from me. What did the two of you do? It doesn't matter. And the conclusion is... I would rather have people like Maura, Karmen, Milly, and Alya, to be my friends in this world than an annoying guy like Rangga! Because to be honest, the four of you are so good to me. The four of you are my true friends. Trust me. If anything happens, please tell me. Can we talk for a moment? Let's talk over there. I want to apologize to you for what happened in Kwitang yesterday. What for? I guess I was out of line. At which part were you being out of line? Clearly, I made you angry. So now, I'm apologizing to you. Fine, you're forgiven. I'm sure your friends don't like to see me here. Why are you bad mouthing my friends again? I'm sure you're also ashamed of talking with me here. What makes you think so? If you're not ashamed, why wouldn't you look at my eyes? You're looking anywhere else. Are you ashamed of me? You're so negative! I just want to read the minds of popular kids like you and your friends. So you can read the minds of popular kids? And now you dare to decide that we don't have individuality or principle! If you feel uncomfortable in crowded space, whose fault is that? Is it mine? Is it also my fault that you don't have any friend now? Or my friends' fault? Whose fault is that? You only want to hurt me. Not to sincerely apologize. You only want to hurt and mock me along with my friends. Let me tell you something. You're insane. Do you know that? What's your deal with Cinta? -It's private. -I know that. But what is it? And who are you to her? Her bodyguard? No need to ask questions. Just answer mine. So, you're the only one who can ask? Hey! Just so you know, Borne is Cinta's boyfriend. Don't mess with him! If you mess with him, you'll also have to deal with me and the rest. -Is that understood? -Oh, really? Where's Borne? Where does Borne go? I don't know. Let's make a deal. After you fight me, you should promise not to bother Cinta anymore. I'm sure no one else feels bothered except you and your boy band members. I RAN TO THE FOREST AND SCREAMED. I RAN TO THE BEACH AND SANG. SO QUIET AND LONELY. I HATED IT. I LONGED FOR THE CLAMOR OF THE MARKET. I'm hungry. What took you so long? Have you heard Borne's story about Rangga's family? What did he say? He said Rangga's dad was problematic. What do you mean with problematic? Oh, really? When you face a tiger, take off your pants, stoop and say, "Tiger, tiger!" -Seriously? -Tiger, tiger, like that! Hold on. I need to get a script from upstairs. Who are you looking for Cinta? Is Rangga here? No, he's been absent for two days. Where did he go? Went back to his hometown in Mars, perhaps? To see his extended alien family. Okay, I'm leaving. Mr. Wardiman! Why are you ignoring me? Gosh. Then should I call your name like those 12th grade boys? Sir. Sir, do you know where Rangga is? Rangga? -Who's that? -A friend from school. Oh, please come in. -Your dad? -Please sit down. What brings you here? Right. Mr. Wardiman said... that your condition is bad after some people beat you up. -Tell me the story. -Mr. Wardiman lied to you. He simply loves to cause a sensation. He was also the one who sent my poem to the committee of the competition. So, why do you look like that? Oh, this. When I got off the bus at Bulak Rantai yesterday, there was a brawl. Some people ganged up on me. So I ended up like this. You haven't told me what brings you here? Why? Do you miss me? Did you miss fighting with me? -If that's what you think, I'll go home. -Please don't go. I was just kidding. Thank you, sir. -Have a drink. -Yes. -My name is Yusrizal. -I'm Cinta. "Cinta"? -What a nice name. -Thank you, sir. Go on. Have a drink. Why did you make the drink? Then who should've made it? Are you going to make us drinks? No. Hey, Monkey. You told me that you're going to cook. Are you still going to do it? Cook? Milly. -Did you really call Cinta? -Yes. -So, she's not home? -No. -I'm sure you can't cook. -I can. What can you do? Boil water? Instant noodles. Is there anything I can do to help? Let's see. You can chop this. This one? Okay, I can chop. Don't you have a housekeeper? We have one. But she just returned to her hometown. Her sibling is having a baby. What about... Your mom? Can you make the cut a bit slanted? Alya, do you know what's up with Cinta? Still mulling over Borne, perhaps? It's your fault. You're the one who keeps pushing her to date Borne. -Excuse me. -What? Why are you blaming me? Ouch, it stings. Ouch. Here, let me. It stings, I swear. It's the left one. Ouch. Ouch. It hurts. So annoying! So annoying! Do you like this type of music? Well, it's not bad. Get ready, Cinta. -For what, sir? -To eat. Unfortunately, the dishes aren't as good as the music. But they smell quite good, sir. There are only two dishes. Please understand. You're eating in a house of a pensioner who never received his pension money. What do you mean? The consequence of being a rebel. Shut up, Monkey! -Who's the rebel? -Who else. How? In 1996, he made a thesis about the depravity of government officials. That is equal to asking for death. It's okay if he only got fired. They called him a communist. Accused him of being a part of a rebellion. But we're in the reformation era. So there should be no more problem? What kind of reformation, Cinta? It seems that we need to move away soon. Are you all right? Hey, stop! Cowards! Rangga! Have you found out who threw the bomb yesterday? It's better that we don't know than to know but unable to punish them. You don't go to class? I just want to return this. You don't need to do that. It's for you. -Seriously? -Yes, if you like it. I love it. Yesterday, I haven't told you this. They're performing in the Blues Cafe every Saturday night. Really? Do you want to go together? I'll go there tonight. Why do you need so long to think? I'll call you this afternoon. Okay. I'll wait for it. Bye. Maura, this is Cinta. Maura. I don't think I can come with you tonight. I don't know. I feel dizzy suddenly. I think I'll visit the doctor. What can I do? I'm sick. Is that okay? Please send my apology to the others. Have fun! Bye! Rangga? -Don't go home too late. -Okay, boss! Cinta, it's from Alya. Wait for a second, Mom. Hold on a second, Alya. Sir, please wait for a moment. Alya, you haven't left with the others? What's wrong? What should I do, Alya? I'm about to leave. I'm going... To the doctor. Hello, Alya? What should I do... I'm just about to leave. The taxi is already waiting outside. Okay. Here's the plan. I'll go to your house after this. And I'll spend the night there. Okay, Alya? Okay, Alya? Okay then. I have to go now. Bye. Thank you. -Who's the guitarist? -His name is Rama. -Rama! -Why did you call him? He's a family of mine. This is Cinta. -Hi, I'm Rama. -Cinta. So, you're Cinta. What did you say about me? He said there was an annoying girl who wanted to see us. But I really love your demo tape. Thank you very much. But if she makes it, I'm sure it would be better. I told him that you could sing. What? That's a lie. Don't trust him. Hold on a minute. Good evening. That was supposed to be my break time. But I just met a friend, a special friend of my brother, Rangga. Her name is Cinta. This is her first time here. And she's going to sing a song. Yes. There she is. Give an applause to Cinta. Actually, I'm not a good singer. I just love to do it. If you ask me to sing now, I wouldn't know what song to sing. So, I'll do something else. Hold on. Okay. I see. Okay. I ran to the forest and sang. I ran to the beach and screamed. So quiet. So quiet and lonely. I hated it. I longed for the clamor of the market. I was so tired of tiredness. Stay away from me o darkness. As if covered in soot when I was alone. Alya! Open the door! Alya! Just break the glass to make a commotion. To cry in pain and cause an uproar. Alya! Get out! There is an angel knitting the striped spider webs on the white walls of the palace. Why not hit the bell to ring it? Or should I run to the forest and turn to the beach? But were you upset that I performed your poem like that? Of course not. It was awesome. Your voice is quite nice. Oh, really? Thank you. Taxi! -They all wouldn't stop. -Where should we go? Let's cross the street. There are puddles. Gosh. It's hard to find a taxi. We should just walk home. Isn't it too far? Not bad. There is a peanut vendor. Let's buy some. It's been long since the last time I ate them. -Sir, do you have boiled peanuts? -Yes. -Cinta, there's a taxi. -Okay. -To Sriwijaya Golf, sir. -Yes. -Come on. -Child, may I take the taxi? I'm already late. Do you mind? -No, ma'am. -Thank you. -Would it be okay if we walk? -What? Because you're not used to walking. If your feet swell tomorrow, you would blame me. Oh, please. Can you stop mocking me for once? But it's true that everything is done by a housekeeper in your house. Not really. But she's already there. So why not give her a job? If you can do it by yourself, why hire a housekeeper? If you have a housekeeper, why do it by yourself? Let's go. Cinta. -I need to talk to you for a minute. -What is it? -How dare you! -Ouch! You're so evil! What a jerk! Your dad is cool. He was willing to make drinks for the guests. That's normal for him. Rangga. May I ask you something? Sure. Don't be angry. Do you want to ask about my mom? Yes. My mom and sibling left my dad a long time ago. May I know why? Perhaps they were tired of living with a controversial guy like him. Or they couldn't stand being the subject of gossips. Or perhaps... Do you know how many people did I tell about my family? There are two. The first is Mr. Wardiman and you're the second. I'm actually ashamed of talking about this to people. They would think that my mom is an irresponsible woman. You don't need to talk about it anymore. I shouldn't ask about it. Forgive me. It's late. I should go home. You should get in. It's already late. Hey Mom and Dad. Where are you going? Darling, we need to go to the hospital. Alya. What's wrong with Alya? Maura has called a few times. She said Alya was admitted to the hospital. Why? She... tried to commit suicide. Please forgive me for being late, ma'am. -Where were you? -Sorry, Maura. I don't need your apology, just your explanation. You said you went to see a doctor. But your dad said you went to a club! So which one is the truth? You're no longer just a good poet, you're also a good actress. I want to see Alya. No way! She's still unstable. You shouldn't bother her yet. You better pray that she will have a long life. So you will still have time to apologize to her. Cinta? Yes, Mom. You have a call from Rangga. Darling, there is a call from Rangga. Will you take it? Just tell him that I'm not home, Mom! Cinta, I understand that you're upset about Alya, but don't be like this, darling. Mom, please. I really don't want to talk to him. Please. Everything is a mess! You keep throwing a temper tantrum, of course it's a mess. Just shut your mouth! Can you stop throwing a tantrum like that? Don't think because you're good at sports, especially basketball, and acting like a thug, that I'm scared of you. I'm better than you. All you do is stare at the mirror. Being coquettish. Just so you know. You get it? Cut it out, you two! Now it's my turn to speak. I know I'm the dumbest one, you all see me as a clown. Suit yourself! But I know that this is wrong. We're not meant to fight. Look at this! Have we ever argued about who's the best among us? Never. And why? Because we're friends. Milly. Nobody thinks that you're useless. You're the funniest among us. We love you the most because you're never angry. We're like this because Cinta is acting strange. That's all, Milly. Calm down, Milly. Cinta! Are you all right? What's wrong? I think we shouldn't meet anymore. What do you mean? Just please stop approaching me. Approaching you? I don't understand. Since I met you, I've been turning into someone else. Someone who isn't good. You see. One of us will tend to be more emotional or logical. But apparently, you're neither. I'm just saying I'm used to unfair treatment. But just one thing. There'll be no more apology. I agree. We shouldn't talk with each other anymore. Forgive me, Alya. I shouldn't have gone there. I said that I would always be there for all of you. But then I lied and betrayed all of you. Everyone is fighting with each other. And the worst is your current condition. No. It wasn't your fault. I was the one being stupid. No, but at least I-- It's okay, Cinta. If you look at the good side, at least my stupid action made my mom opens her eyes. What do you mean? She decided to leave my dad. Gosh, Alya! I swear I don't know whether to be happy or sad for you now. But to be honest I'm relieved. By the way, where did you go that night? I'm sure you can guess. Did you go out with Rangga? Yes, I went out with him. Oh my goodness, Cinta! Did I just mishear it? You went out with Rangga? Don't you hate him? -Did he put spell on you? -No, he didn't. It's just that he's different from the other guys that I know. He's unique. I agree. Rangga is unique. At a glance, he's annoying, but he's actually very handsome. So why don't you go look for him. No. I finally realized my mistake, Maura, Karmen. I realized it and want to apologize to all of you. Will you forgive me? I know I would deserve it if you don't consider me as a friend anymore. But you need to know that I'll always consider you as my true friends. Cinta, we were angry because we love you so much. We really love you. Whatever Rangga did that made you like this, just forget it. Because we're here to help and defend you. Yes, Cinta. Are we still going to watch a movie tonight? Come on, Cinta. -Go watch a movie. -Come on. -Gosh. -Go on. That's more like it. Come on, Cinta. Why did you blame Rangga? It seemed like he liked you. So I beat him up. GIRL Oh gosh, Cinta. Cinta. What do you mean? Okay. Please be honest to us. And answer this question with the simplest reply. Are you sure you're not hiding your feelings about Rangga? Cinta. Did the thought of Rangga honestly never cross your mind? Oh gosh, Cinta. Cinta, why are you crying? Please don't cry. Cinta. Are you in love with Rangga? -Cinta. -I really care about him. Oh dear, Cinta. I'm also confused. I can't forget him. It's alright, sweetie. I'm afraid all of you would leave me if I date him. No way, sweetie. You're out of line. What kind of friends do you think we are? We might be careful when it comes to boys. But that doesn't mean that we decide who you can date. Remember last year with Maura, when she liked that playboy named Danny. Do you remember him? When they dated, we didn't reprimand her. And when she faced the consequence, did we blame her? No. That's enough, Karmen. Sorry, Cinta. I lost control. It's okay, sweetie. Okay, here's the plan. You should hurry up to tell Rangga how you feel. Before you regret it. But I can't. I'm sure he hates me. I hurt him so badly. Exactly. You need to explain to him that you were upset back then. And if Rangga really likes you, I'm sure he would be able to understand. Trust me. But I'm not ready yet. I need a more appropriate time. I feel that if you want to see Rangga, you need to hurry up. I saw Mr. Wardiman and Rangga hugged each other, like they're going to be parted. - Mr. Wardiman! - Mr. Wardiman! Mr. Wardiman! -Where is Rangga? -Where is he, sir? He didn't say goodbye to you? Said goodbye? Where's he going? He's going to study abroad, to America, to New... -New-- -New York. When will he leave? What should we do, Milly? It's too close. Too close. -Too close. -Then what do we do? Where are you going in a hurry? -Mamet, please. Help us. -Mamet. Fine, I'll drive you. Where are we going? -To the airport. -Hurry up. Let's go. Hurry up, Mamet. -Oh gosh. -Hey, Mamet! -What the heck! -What are you doing? You can't even open the car door, much less driving it. -So slow. -Gosh! -Hurry up! -You go to the back! Get in! Are you sure you don't want to call Cinta? Yes. Just to say goodbye. She already said goodbye to me. Loser. You give up too soon. Milly, switch to the fifth gear. -We're in a rush. Come on. -No, don't do that. Keep it at 80 km per hour! Leave her be. She's the driver. -Come on, Milly. -You're so noisy. Shut up. That's it. Come on, Milly. Stop it. This is my dad's car-- Why don't you shut up! Just shut up. -Slow down. -Come on, Milly! -Keep your hands away! -You're disturbing Milly! Come on, Milly. How could you? Gosh. Hey, be patient! Hey, it's open! Did you call Cinta? Her mom picked up the phone. She wasn't home. Hey, be careful! Good job, Milly! Hurry up! -Come on, Milly. -Hold on, kid. -Where are you going? -This is an emergency, sir. -Wait a minute. -Here, sir. It's just an ID card. I'm not even sure if it's real or fake. Whose car is this? My car, sir! -Actually, it's mine. -Whatever! That's Rangga! Rangga! -Rangga! -Rangga! -Rangga! -Rangga! Rangga! Where are you all going? Sir, we all need to talk with that guy over there. -That one! -But you can't enter. This place is only for passengers. But this is very important. -Important for what? -For... -May we speak for a moment, sir? -Yes? -Go ahead. Just this lady. -Me? -Fine. -Thank you, sir. BOARDING Rangga! Cinta? Rangga. Rangga. The last time I saw you, I wasn't angry at you. But at myself. Rangga, please forgive me. I don't want you to leave. What do you mean? I... I love you so much. I love you too. So much. So, you won't leave? Tell me that you won't leave. I have to go. This is unfair. It's so unfair. Rangga. Hold on a minute. Read the last page.
