"Gangland guns slay rival racketeer. Big Tim O'Hara latest victim of underworld war." This is murder... Just plain murder. Besides, this is the first time in the history of this organization a rod has had to be used. You know, you guys, by pulling this thing, have made Little John awful brokenhearted. Aw, boss, you shouldn't take that altitude towards us. The guy was chiseling in on us. Me and Philadelphia Powell caught him red-handed. Sure, boss. Everybody thought you'd be glad to have that guy eliminated. That ain't it. The job was pulled at Molly madigan's. The police have closed up the joint. Now where is a guy going to get a plate of corned bee and cabbage in New York? Yeah. It was tough on Molly using her establishment for that there kind of work. Yeah. A lot of people are funny like that. They don't want to sit there eating when that kind of merchandise is being carried out. Besides, why wasn't I in on the know beforehand? We're partners, ain't we? Why wasn't I given no memo? Lay off, will you, Johnny? The guy's washed up, ain't he? You bet he's washed up. So is Molly Madigan's business. So is our record, and so am I! Man: What do you mean? You heard what I said. I've been getting fed up on this business, and I've been thinking of getting out. This here latest transaction convinces me. Boss, you don't know what you're saying. I know exactly what I'm saying. I'm fed up on this business. I don't see no career in it no more. Besides, I'm too sensitive. Johnny, what are you going to do? Plenty. I got my little bundle. I'm going to retire, see? From now on, I'm going after the 2 things I've always wanted most: Good taste and refinement. I'm going to get what I was born to have: Class. What kind of conversation is this? The guy's blown his roof off. Cut the clowning, Johnny. The guys ain't in the mood for it. I ain't clowning. I'm on the level. I'm through with the rackets forever. From now on, the business is yours. I'm stepping out. Of course, without Little John, you're practically starting from scratch, but you'll get along. You mean that, Johnny? Absolutely. This is a kiss-off. You guys are no longer looking at John Sarto, boss of the rackets; you're now looking at John T. Sarto, world sportsman, socialite, and art student. Where you going, boss? First I'm going to tell Flo. Then tomorrow I'm off for London, Paris, and St. Moritz... And with all the class that goes with them there joints. Oh, Willie, come and help me pack. So long, guys. I won't be seeing you. He's certainly going a long way to get class. The way he's going after it, he'll probably come back reeking with it. Now, don't worry, pal. He'll never come back. Look, Johnny. Don't it look elegant? Yeah. It's got class, all right. You dumb cluck, you got it pasted on the inside. Sure. It gets scratched on the outside. Anybody's smart enough to know that. You know, Flo, sometimes you got me guessing whether you're even a nitwit. Ok, Johnny. That's the thanks I get for dropping in to help you pack. Aw, I'm sorry, baby. Look, I didn't mean I should hurt your feelings. You know, I keep forgetting you don't catch on to class as fast as I do. Where do you want me to tuck these croquet mallets, boss? See what I'm up against? Not croquet, stupid; Them's Polo clubs. Won't they fit in the trunk? Not a chance, not even if I bend them. I got an idea, Johnny. Pinky Johnson over at the cancan club has got a black bow fiddle case you could borrow. No good. Hop over to the cancan, ask pinky if he ain't got a brown one he could let you have. Ok. I want to match my luggage so nobody can say Little Johnny ain't in good taste. Aw, you're always in good taste. That's what's gotten me kind of jumpy-- I mean, you and me tearing around Rome and all them places and me with a maiden name. I don't get you. I mean us taking this trip. Us? Who said we're taking the trip? Well, ain't we? Now, look, baby, I don't want to hurt your feelings, see? But Little Johnny's going to take this trip alone. But you and me-- just like you said, it wouldn't be proper, now, would it? Besides, I'd kind of like to get away by myself for a little while. Now, you understand, don't you? Sure... I understand. Aw, Flo. Why don't you come right out and say it? Why don't you say you're tired of me and this is the blowoff? Aw, baby, now, how can you talk this way? How can you even think this way? Well, it is, ain't it? Flo, when you say that, it's like sticking a knife in me. When you look like you mean it, it's like breaking the handle off. Well, I can't help it, Johnny. You and me been going together for 5 years now. Of course, I know you been awful busy. Say, has some woman been talking to you? It seems to me, if a fella loved a girl enough, he could take 5 minutes off to hop over to the city hall or to dig up some judge. Now, stop mentioning judges. I'm superstitious. Ok, Johnny. Forget it. Anyway, we had some good times together. Aw, now, look, baby, I'm still nuts about you. The only reason we ain't married is because we haven't gotten around to it. Now, when I come back and I'm a gentleman, we're going to have a big wedding, a church wedding. Gee, and I ain't been in a church since the night your brother was bumped off. You're swell, kid. You know, you deserve the best. Aw, Johnny. I ain't forgetting you either. You know, I'm going to take care of you before I go. Are you? Bet your life. I always said I was going to do something big for you, didn't I? Now's the time. Gee, Johnny! You always wanted to be in show business, didn't you? Do I? Well, watch. Get me Al royer at the Crescent club. I'll show you how you stand with me. The Crescent club? That's the biggest nightclub in town. Hello, Al! Little John Sarto. Oh, fine, pal. How's yourself? Say, listen, you know Flo Addams, don't you? Uh, my fiancee. That's right. Well, look, I'm going off to Europe, see? And when I'm gone, I want you to spot her in your nightclub. That's right. You will? Well, that's fine, Al. I appreciate it. Yeah, she'll be over tomorrow afternoon at 2:00. Well, that's fine, pal. Thanks, pal! So long, pal. Well, do I get into the club? You bet your life. Tomorrow afternoon you start right in as-- as a what? Hatcheck girl. Oh, gosh, Johnny! [Laughing] See how Little John takes care of the people he likes, huh? [Toot] Oh, Johnny. Good-bye. Good-bye, Johnny. Good-bye, baby. Bye. Bye. Good-bye. Flo: Bye. Good-bye. I trust you had good luck, monsieur. Hmm? Oh. Here, pal. Better frame this. This is the last one for the biggest sucker in the world. Thank you, monsieur. Oh, where's the nearest cable office? In the lobby of the hotel, monsieur. Thanks. Do you read English? Certainly, monsieur. That is my business. Then read that. "To monsieur Jack buck, Willie the kneef"-- knife. Oh, yeah. "Willie the knife, French Frank, Mugsy O'Day, Philadelphia Powell"-- yeah. Ok, ok. Read the message. "Good news, boys. "I'm coming home to be your boss again. "With the class I got now, "we'll all make plenty of kopecks. Love and kisses, Little John Sarto." Yeah. Cross out the word kopecks. Put in mazuma. Oui, monsieur. Mazuma. Yeah. That's better English. Oui, monsieur. Oh, by the way, where's the nearest hockshop? Hockshop? Yeah, hockshop. You know. A pawnbroker. Oh, pawnbroker. Oui, monsieur. Go to the head doorman at the gambling casino. He has the concession. Yeah? I should have known that. What are your plans in the United States? Returning to business. Some pressure was brung on me, so I decided to skip over to the states and head my organization again. My board of directors is meeting me on the pier. Man: A little welcome-home party, huh? That's right. Pardon me, sir. They're ready for your baggage now, sir. Thanks. Sorry, you guys, but I have to skip now. Thank you very much, Mr. Sarto. The pleasure's all mine. Hiya, Johnny! Boss, welcome home! Johnny, you're a sight for sore eyes. Same goes for me. Glad to be back. Say, where's Willie the knife? He had a little business to attend to. Here. Let me take your baggage checks. We got a car waiting. Come on. Let me take your arm. Wait a minute, now. Take your foot off the gas. Where's Jack buck? He's over at the joint getting ready to welcome you. Yeah. All the boys are up there waiting. Never mind about the customs. I got that all fixed up already. Where's the car? We've got a limousine parked right outside. Come on. Let's duck this crowd. You don't mind all this service, do you, boss? Boy, I love it. Push ahead there, will you, and open up a path for me. Gee, will the boys be glad to see you! Just like yesterday, huh, boss? Oh, yeah. Oh, uh... Say, why ain't my name on there? We took it off when you quit, boss. Put it back on. Without my name on there, it ain't got no eclat. That's a French word we use in France. It means "pretty nifty." [Laughs] Come in, boss. This is it. Well, Johnny! How are you? Good to see you, Johnny. Well! Pinky, how are you? How have you--well, say, look at that. Aw, this is grand. I sure appreciate the sentiment, boys. Ahh. Just like the good old days... Everything just the way I left it. Yeah. Furniture, books, everything. Still there. Same old private apartment. Just the same. Sure looks good. Boy, do you remember some of the parties we held in here? Hey, pal, huh? Yes, sir, Johnny. Those were the good old days. Come on in here. I want you to talk to the boys. I want you to take your old seat, too, right up front. Certainly nice to be back with the old mob. Jack: Mugsy, show the boss to his old seat. Mugsy: That's a pleasure. Johnny: Thanks, mugsy. There you are, boss. Oh, boy, oh, boy. This is what I've been looking forward-- [buzz] [Loud laughter] A hot seat, huh? Who done it? Who's the wise guy? Come on, now. Speak up! If you don't, I'll break every guy's head in this room. Relax. You ain't scaring nobody. Say, do you know who you're talking to? Sure. To Little Johnny Sarto, and you don't mean a thing. You might as well get this through your nut right now. You walked out on us 5 years ago and left us flat. You give me the rackets and made me the boss. Do you think I'm going to be chump enough to step down now? So that's it. Now I get it. As far as the rackets are concerned, you're through, Johnny. And let me give you a little tip. You can stay around this burg as long as you want to, but it will be healthier if you leave. Because from now on, I ain't liking you, and I'm liable to not like anything you do, see? A showdown, huh? All right, wise guy. Mugsy, Philadelphia, Frank, who's it going to be? Him or Little John? Come on, now. Speak up! Who's your boss?! What is this? What am I doing, dreaming? No, you ain't dreaming. The sooner you get it through that puffed-up little head of yours that you're out of the business, the better. Now, get out of here. Go on. Get him out of here. Throw him out in the street. Johnny: Let me go! I'll get out, but I'm coming back. And I'm organizing a new mob, and someday I'm going to blast you guys right off the earth. I'll show you yellow mugs-- don't stand there taking his guff. Throw him out. Get your hands off me! Get them off me! [Men shouting] All right, get out of here! [Irish accent] Here, now. Where do you think you're going? Up to miss Addams' apartment. I'm Little John Sarto. I don't care what size you are. You ain't goin' up to no miss Addams' apartment. Why not? Because about 8 months ago, miss Addams up and flew her fine feathers over to the parkway biltmore. The parkway biltmore? What did she do? Get a job as a maid there? I don't know, but 'tis been said she's doing real well. Yeah? Well, thanks. "Ackers, Addison, Anderson, applebee, bassett, bliss"-- no. There's no miss Addams working here. But her landlady said she came with you 8 months ago. I'm sorry, Buddy, but we ain't got no record of it. Hey, Al, you better step on it. Miss Addams says she wants to see them before she goes out. Just a minute there. Addams? Could that be Flo Addams? No. This is miss Florence Addams, a guest here. Couldn't be the one you're looking for. Yeah? Well, I'm just crazy enough to go up and see. Here, wait up. [Buzz buzz buzz] Tell Albert to drag them in, Fifi. I ain't got much time. Oui, madame. Fifi: Oh, come in, Albert. Ha ha! Napoleon. Fifi-- Johnny? Oh... Oh, Johnny! Now, never mind the hysterics. Get rid of the audience. You can go now, Albert. Fifi, take Napoleon and Josephine out on the terrace. Me and Mr. Sarto wish to be alone. Oh, Johnny. 5 years you've been gone. Gee, you don't know how I've missed you. Yeah. From the looks of things, it's good I come back. What's the idea of all this layout? You always wanted me to have class, didn't you? Yeah, but this joint's so full of it, it leaks. Now, don't tell me you got it selling cigarettes. I ain't a cigarette girl no more. You ain't? Why'd you quit the Crescent club? I didn't quit it. You didn't? I own it. Are you kidding? No, I ain't. I bought Al royer out a year ago. With what? Hay? Alfalfa. That's what Clarence raises. Look, one of us is cuckoo. Now, let's start this over again. Who's Clarence? He's a big rancher from out west. He's interested in cows. Oh, yeah? Especially when they wear petticoats, huh? If you're insinuating there's anything between us outside of business, you're mistaken. Besides, I ain't worn a petticoat in years. Yeah? From now on, this cowboy's out of the picture, see? You can tell him he can pack up his wigwam, go back to the wide open spaces. You're jealous. No, I ain't jealous. I'm just a little suspicious of a guy that looks for pastureland on 42nd street. Johnny. What? You ain't kissed me yet. I'll get around to that. First I got something important to do. Where's Willie the knife? In Pattonsville. That's a private sanitarium over in Jersey for mental disorders. Say, he's got his nerve going crazy just when I need him. He ain't really crazy. He's just playing at it to get away from Jack buck. He quit him a couple of weeks ago. Jack buck's a bad guy, Johnny. Yeah. I found out about that, but don't worry. He ain't going to be much longer. Hello, operator. Get me the Pattonsville sanitarium. That's right. New Jersey. All right, I'll hold on. There's a rumor Jack buck don't like you no more. Yeah. I know. I confirmed it. That's why I got to act quick. I don't think you'll get Willie. They're kind of funny about letting you talk to guests. I'll get him, all right. This is Little John Sarto. How long will it take us to drive over to where Willie is at? 40 minutes, the way you drive. Good. I'll tell him we'll be right over to pick him up. Maybe he won't want to leave. He told me on a postcard he's in a grand hideout and having a swell time with his mental disorder. Whoever told you that on a postcard, maybe they ought to keep him there. Hello, Pattonsville. Let met talk to Willie Corson. Who am I? His grandfather. Who do you think? Just a moment. The phone, Willie. Your grandfather wants to talk to you. Go on. The phone. Don't keep grandpa waiting. That's a nice boy. Ok, I'll bite. But sometimes I don't know who's being kept here-- you guys or me. Hello. Johnny: Listen, flat head, this is Little John Sarto. Boss! Look, Willie, I want you to pick up a couple of roscoes and grab a torpedo or two. But, boss, you forget where I am. They're awful peculiar up here, and they get kind of hurt if you walk out on the joint. Just leave a note and say that you... Well, went to the store. That will take care of everything. Of course, I ain't really wacky. I had meself put into the joint, but the kiss-off may not be so easy. Now, listen, screwball, you leave everything to me, see? Now I'm back in business, and I need you, and I ain't got no time for no red tape. I'll be up to get you in a couple of hours. Now, you be ready. All right, kid, put a hat on. We're shoving off. Well, I guess I don't. Don't what? Don't get kissed. Well, all right. It's broad daylight, but come on. Aw, Johnny! Hey... This cowboy of yours. You sure you haven't been doing no rehearsaling? What do you mean? The way you come at me, I don't know whether you're going to hug me or saddle me. Pardon, madame. Monsieur Fletcher is on the phone. Oh. That's Clarence. Wait a minute. Hello, Clarence. Say, where you at? [Southern accent] I reckon you're going to be powerful mad at me, for being so late in phoning you. This morning I got so lonesome to see a cow, I went over to Jersey to the stockyards. Whenever me and cows get together, time just don't mean nothing. What about the curtain material? Well, say, I'm having mighty poor luck trying to match this here material for you. It seems like every store in town is just plumb out of it. Well, let it go, Clarence. Say, where's your car? I want to borrow it for a friend of mine. You'll do no such thing. Tell him to pack up and get out of town. Wait a minute, Clarence. Don't be a lug. He can drive, and you and me can sit in the backseat and talk. Say, who is this mug, anyway? Can he be trusted? Oh, sure, he can. He's dumb but nice. You'll feel sorry for him. And he loaned me a lot of money. All right. Tell him to get over here quick and have plenty of gas in his car. Ok. Clarence, you get right over here quick and put plenty of gas in your car. You know what? You're going to drive me and my boyfriend out in the country. You bet. That sure is nice of you. [Whistling bird calls] Aw, gee, honey, it's nice to have you back. That's the third time you've told me. You don't have to oversell it. What's that whistling I hear? That's Clarence making bird calls. He's awful good. [Imitates an owl] You want to see him impersonate a Robin? What'll he do? Eat a worm? Aw, Johnny, you just don't like him, and he's awful nice. You know what? He loaned me $10,000 to buy out the club and never asked for nothing. How'd you meet him? In a way any respectable lady would meet a perfect gentleman. He passed out in the club one night. What did you do? Hold his head? No. His wallet. But I give it back to him the next night. So you had to prove you was dumber than him, huh? Aw, Johnny, you're jealous, and you don't have to be. He don't mean a thing. You're the only one who was ever in my life and ever will be. I'm sorry, baby. I think I know how you feel, and I'm going to give you a chance to prove it. How? Do you love me? Oh, do I! Put that robe around my legs, will you? My ankles are getting cold. [Clarence imitates a cuckoo] Who's the guy driving for them? I don't know. Do you know that guy with them, Mugsy? He's some guy who's been hanging around the Crescent club. They say Flo is the lull in his life. Oh, yeah? We better check up on him when we get back. You two wait here. I'll only be a few minutes. How do you like Mr. Sarto, Clarence? Oh, I like him fine. Sure makes me feel awful discouraged, though. Why? He's so nice and outspoken, nothing put on. That's what I like in him. I reckon so do the ladies. Well, they better not, not while I'm around. Gee, it must be swell. What? For Mr. Sarto--having a wonderful girl like you in love with him. Aw, now, Clarence. I mean it. I know how I'd be. Well, you'll meet the right girl someday, Clarence. You just have to feel your way. All I want to do is get Willie out of here, see? I'm his employer. That won't be difficult. This is a private institution. Willie confined himself here voluntarily. He's free to leave anytime he feels that he's reacquired his mental faculties. Let me talk to him, see? I'll tell him to get them back right away. Where is he? Right down the hall. I'll show you. Boss! Am I glad to see you! Welcome home. Here! Sit down. Wait a minute. Take it easy. That's what the other guys told me, and it was a foul ball. Not with me, boss. I'm 100 % for you. You better be. I got things to tell you. Oh, excuse us, will you, pal? I want to talk to Willie alone. Certainly. I'll be in the office. Thanks. That's a nice gent. I can't get over that you're back! Now, button your lip and listen, will you? I got work for you to-- move over, will you? I got work for you to do, see? Now, here's what I want you to do. Don't say nothing to them, Clarence. They're bad medicine. Shucks. I ain't afraid of a few lunatics. Hello, kid. Good morning. What's your boyfriend doing up here? Got something up his sleeve, huh? Just ignore him, Clarence. He'll go away. Double-talk. I reckon you boys better go someplace else and play. That's nice, fellas. Now, come on. Come on. That's a hot one. Where'd your boyfriend go, toots? Inside? Don't pay him no attention, Clarence. Just play like they're not here. Now, come on, fellas. Be nice, boys. Now, come on, fellas. Come on. First thing I got to do is round up a new organization. I'm going to put a mob together that'll run Jack buck right out of the country. Now you're talking. Who will we get? I don't know. I've been away for 5 years. Times have changed. Who do you know that's tough and running around loose? What month is this? June. Why? Handsome Harry Edwards will be out. I can grab him in Philly. Now, who else? A torpedo's what I'll need. Turkey Malone is the guy you want. He just got back from fighting in one of them foreign wars. Is he any good? Is he any good?! They was paying him piece work. Ok, now, here's what you do. You take a powder out of this joint tonight, round up a mob, and meet me Saturday night at the crest hotel over on Fulton street. We'll work out of there. Don't forget to remember this: Don't do anything to Jack buck or his mob beforehand that'll tip them off. Understand? Right. [Flo screams] What's that? Sounds like a mutiny! [Punches being thrown] Nothing to worry about, Mr. Sarto. I'm just bringing in a couple of nuts here that was kind of bothering Florence and me. Look. Look, boss, who they are! Where's Flo? In the car. She fainted. I'm going out and tell her to move over. What time is it? 20 after 11:00. Maybe something happened to Willie, huh? I don't like this whole setup, boss. We're just conning ourself if we think we can knock over Jack buck. What are you talking about? Didn't I take the pushcart peddlers away from him? What about the fruit peddlers in canarsie? Who had them before Jack buck? Who's got them now? Me. Yeah. We done a lot in 10 days, but I still say we got to be careful. Yeah. So far all we've grabbed off this guy buck has been peanuts, but this is different. Now, look, you mugs, I'm getting tired of this kind of conversation. If any of you guys are getting nervous and want to drop out of the picture, there's the door. You got us wrong, Johnny. We ain't yellow. We just think you're going a little too far too soon with Jack buck. [Knock on door] Now, shut up, everybody. Open the door, Harry. Come in, gentlemen. Look, Johnny, I don't know nothing. I never did--oh! Shut up. I'll do the talking. You answer when you're told to. Put him in the chair. I hear Jack buck's got a date this afternoon with the acme paving company to sell them some protection. Now, who is he meeting, and where is it going to be? Honest, Johnny, we ain't got no date with the acme. Then you're a liar. We know all about it. Now, are you going to get smart and talk, or do you need a little working on? I'm telling you the truth. I don't know nothing. Even if they have got a date, I don't know about it. Now, this is your last chance. Are you going to spill it, or do I start to work? You're crazy. You can't get away with this. Now... I'll talk, boss! I'll talk. Now you're getting smart. Now, who is he going to see, and where are they meeting? They're seeing Tom Bailey in his office on 8th Avenue this afternoon at 3:00. The fee is 2 gs a month. Philadelphia Powell and Al Muller will be present. Now, that's all I wanted to know. See how easy it was to talk, Mugsy? Give him a cigar, dopey. No, sir, Mr. Bailey, you haven't got a thing to worry about. From now on, if any of the men get out of line, all you got to do is reach for a telephone. We'll only bite you once a month for your dues. That's all there is to it. Naturally, I want to avoid any more trouble. I think you know what-- [door opens] Just got here in time, huh? What do you care? What do you want? Harry: Hoist 'em. Wait a minute, gentlemen. What's this all about? Now, just a minute, Mr. Bailey. I'm Little John Sarto. What are these mugs trying to do to you? You're going to be sorry for this, Johnny. Shut up! These gentlemen represent a protective organization. I was just on the point of taking out a policy with them. You ain't, see? You're taking it out with me. These mugs couldn't protect the nurse in a baby parade. Throw them out. You heard him. Come on. Sit down, Mr. Bailey. Now you and me will get together on some real protection. I reckon it ain't very important. The newspapers have been making a lot more of it. I know, but sometimes the littlest items make the biggest funerals. It just makes me sick way down inside to see you so worried. If there was just something I could do. Monsieur Sarto is on the telephone. Oh. Ok, Fifi. Hello, honey. I've just been thinking about you. Where you at? I'm at the hotel. Say, look, baby, I won't be able to see you for dinner tonight. Oh. You got to lay low, huh? No. It ain't that at all. I got a new deal on the fire. It means a lot to me, and I want to close it quick. Now, stop worrying, will you? How can I help it, Johnny? Every time the phone rings or somebody knocks at the door, I get the needles thinking something's happened to you. Aw, listen, baby, we can't go on like this. Why, yesterday afternoon I couldn't sleep a wink. I know how it is, baby, but can't you see I'm doing all this for us, see? When I'm back there up on top again, you and me will be married, see? We'll have a home life that will be the talk of the town. I'll tell you what. You call me up later and let me know where you're at, hmm? Ok. Everything all right? Oh, sure, everything's all right. If it's a question of money, Florence, I'd be more than happy to help out. I wouldn't dare offer Johnny money. He'd knock me for a loop. It's terrible, Clarence. Really, it's terrible. You want me to tell you something? You know why he's going through all this? Reckon he's broke. No. That ain't it. It's on account of me. You know what he just said on the phone? What? He just said that when he was on top, we were going to be married. Ain't that grand? Yeah. It sure is. And me, the dumb slug, I ain't doing nothing to help him. Even right now he's on a spot, and I ain't doing nothing to take him off it. Worrying about him ain't gonna help matters none. What you need is a vacation. A couple of months on my ranch would do you a powerful lot of good. If there was just something I could do. You'd make a mighty pretty picture coming through the willows in the moonlight, everything so peaceful and quiet. Did you ever smell alfalfa? No. Who makes it? It's grass. Sure smells sweet after it's just been cut. Yeah. Me smelling alfalfa and him cooped up in a cheap hotel room, fighting to make a comeback for me. I know you'd like it on the ranch, Florence, with all the horses and the dogs. I got a cute little gentle pinto pony you could have. All the rest of them buck, but he-- buck. You've given me an idea. Jack buck! What about Jack buck? I'm going right to Jack Buck myself. It's a lot of baloney, him and Johnny being enemies. They got too much on each other. Guess who's outside. Yeah? Who? Flo Addams. Anybody with her? No. She's all by herself. Says she's got to see you right away. Oh, she does, huh? All right, let her come in. Ok. Hey, Mike. Mike: Yes, sir? Johnny Sarto's girl is here. Watch the front just in case. Hello, kid. Hello, Jack. Come on in. Glad to see you. Sit down. Listen, Jack, before I say a word, you've got to promise me something. Sure. What is it? That you don't say nothing to Johnny about this meeting. He'd be awful sore if he knew I was here. I won't say a word. What's on your mind? You and Johnny shouldn't be fighting each other. This is all a lot of hooey. Yeah. It ain't nice, is it? I mean, you and him used to be partners once. You ought to be again. Yeah, but Johnny don't like me no more. It makes me feel bad, too. Aw, it's no good, you two being enemies. You got too much on each other. We have? Sure. For instance, the coppers still want to know who knocked off big Tim O'Hara in Molly Madigan's cafe about 5 years ago. Little John knows all about that. Yeah. That's right. I forgot that entirely. Thanks for reminding me. Aw, you and Johnny could sit down and talk over your differences easy, Jack. I wish we could. It makes me feel sick then why don't you do it? Why don't just you two get together and chew the rag, and I bet you end up shaking hands? I'd like to, but Johnny wouldn't make no date with me alone. It wouldn't hurt to try, would it? Maybe I could arrange it. You could? Sure. Where do you want to meet him? Well, let's see. What about fat dutchy's at, say, 10:00 tonight? That's a little far out, ain't it? [Laughs] Don't worry, kid. I ain't thinking what you're thinking. I just want to get away from the boys, all the boys. You know what I mean. Sure, but couldn't you make it some lawyer's office here in town? No. That's no good. Right away we start off distrusting each other. What Johnny and me has got to do is forget the rough stuff. It's like you said. Him and me has got to sit down alone together. Then in 5 minutes, we're pals, just like we used to be. Am I right? I'd do anything in the world to see it like that. Ok, then... You have Johnny at fat dutchy's tonight at 10:00. I'll be the first guy to stick out my hand. You're on the level? You ain't kidding? You got my word. And no funny business? Johnny's my old-time pal. I wouldn't hurt him for the world. Him and me just had a business misunderstanding. That's all. Aw, thanks, Jack. Oh, and by the way, don't let him know I'm going to be there. I think it would be better for us two guys just to bump into each other. You know what I mean? Sure, sure. I'll just get him there. You got to do the rest. Ok. Oh, Flo. Yeah? You're a swell dame. Yeah? Johnny's a pretty lucky guy. What you're doing for him makes me think this ain't such a bad world after all. You're not such a bad guy yourself, Jack. So long. So long, kid. Mike: Yes, boss? Don't let them 2 gorillas go back to Chicago. Don't make any dates for tonight, Clarence. Are we going out? Yeah. I'm taking you someplace with me for protection. I ain't so dumb as somebody thinks. [Swing music playing] Now, remember, Clarence, park over there and don't come in unless I holler for you. I still don't like the idea of you going in there alone, Florence. Aw, forget it. I've been in this joint before and ain't even been flirted with. Go on. Thank you. Hey, waiter. Yes, lady? Where's your telephone? I'll bring you one. Give me the phone. Here it is. Gee, class, huh? Yeah. Fat dutchy's seen them do it up in the city. Long distance, Crescent 9-9499. [Ring] Hello. [Drunkenly] Hello, Johnny, this is Flo. Don't do that! Can't you see I'm talking to a friend of mine? Don't mind him, Johnny. He just thinks he's funny. Who's getting funny? Where you at? You're going to be awful mad at me, baby. You sound like you're oiled. Have you been drinking? I'm as sober as you are, but they won't let me drive the car. Will you come and get me, baby? I'm at fat dutchy's. Fat dutchy's? That's 30 miles from here. If you think I'm coming out there to get you tonight, you're crazy. I don't think you love me anymore. If you did, you'd come and get me before I pass out all over the place. Say, look, if you're trying to get me nervous, you're just drawing a blank. I'm busy. I'm in conference. Get yourself a cab and let me alone, will you? Ok, my friend, if that's the way you feel about it, just forget I ever bothered you. I'll phone Clarence. He'll come and get me, and I'll tell him what I just heard about Jack buck and the independent freight handlers association. Good-bye. Wait a minute, Flo! Now, don't hang up! What's that you were saying about Jack buck and the freight handlers association? Never mind. You're not interested. You're in a big conference. You're awful busy. Oh, stop it, will you? Don't be so playful! Hello, Johnny. Hang up, will you? So's I can call Clarence. No, I don't want you to come. Just forget about me. I'll see you around sometime. Look, baby, will you stop that talk? I said I'd come out and get you. Now, look, don't drink no more and get them palookas away from you. I'll be right out. Okey-dokey. Wait here. Yes, sir. Hey, Buddy, are you miss Addams' chauffeur? Miss Addams? Yeah. Why? She wanted me to give you this note. [Horn honking] May I check your hat, sir? No. I'll hold it. I won't be here long. What's the big idea? Hello, honey. Gee, I'm glad you come. Sit down. What are you kidding me for, telling me you were stewed? Well, I was, honey, but it wore off. Have you been thinking about me lately? You nuts? What's going on here, anyway? What do you mean, what's going on? What's the idea coming down here? Stop acting like you was making a play for me, will you? We know each other. I was blue this afternoon and went for a ride. You must have been awful blue to come down this far. Listen, if I gave in to all my worries, I'd be in Omaha. Come on. Get your things together, will you? We'll blow out of here. Don't you want a drink first? You ain't never seen me take a drink in your life. What's more, I don't like the way you're sportin' around. You're hiding something. Oh, honey, I've never seen you so suspicious. Now, come on. All right, but I'll powder my nose, and then we'll go. Hi, Flo. Hello, Johnny. Glad to see you, pal. Hello, Jack. What's the gag? You're all alone. This is a good time for you and me to have a little talk. Take that rod out of my back. I'll listen. Warm in here. How about you and me stepping outside for a few minutes, huh? I'm comfortable here. Yeah, but I'm not. That music upsets me. It makes me nervous. My hands are shaking. You know what I mean? Come on. Hiya, Herman. Hi, Jack. Hello, Dave. How's the missis? Fine, Jack. Lovely people. All right, pal. Let's go. Get in, Johnny. Only one thing I want to know. Sure, Johnny. Speak right up. Why did Flo double-cross me? Now, why don't you get smart? She wanted the other guy. You come back and was in the way. That makes sense, don't it? Yeah... That makes sense. [Frogs croaking] Ok, come on. So this is it, huh? Yeah. Yeah, this is it. Ok, red, get going. Come on. Start walking. See what's on the radio, will you, Mugsy? Woman on radio: Now, to drop off to sleep, stretch legs out, toes in. Everybody got his little tootsies in? Now, wait. Say, listen, Buddy, if I get back, you get 5 grand. You got it on you, darling? No, but I can pick it up in a week. Sorry, sweetheart. We do a strictly cash business. Keep going. [Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Groans] [Groans] It's midnight, brother superior. Our meeting has lasted a long time. Perhaps tomorrow things will look better. That's what we've been telling ourselves for the past 3 months. With conditions in the Flower market as they are, I don't see how we're going to continue our charities. We must think of some kind of plan. [Knock on door] Come in. Brother superior, will you please come to the infirmary at once? What has happened? About 10 minutes ago, I heard a groan outside the wall by my window. It was a man terribly hurt. I carried him in. I think he's dying. Come. I made it. I'm in heaven. Don't excite yourself, my son. You've been badly hurt. Then if I'm not in heaven, where am I? You're alive and in a safe place. Say, do you know who I am? No. Ain't you never seen my picture in the papers? We don't see the newspapers here, and we don't ask who a man is if he needs help. How long am I in for? Until you're well and strong again. Well, I ain't got no money. Neither have we. That makes you one of us, doesn't it? This is the monastery of the little brothers of the Flowers. I am brother superior. This is brother wren, your nurse. If you wish us to notify your friends-- I got no friends. You have now. Now you must try to rest. I'll come on in later. If you want anything, ask brother wren. Brother wren, huh? Say, you was a fighter once, wasn't you? We don't ask questions like that. What we were, good or bad, rich or poor, big or small, doesn't matter here. That's double-Jake by me. I think I'm going to like this place. I hope so. Hey, uh... Tell me something. What's the graft here? Graft? Yeah. [Laughs] It's been 15 years or more since I've heard such talk. We raise Flowers and sell them in the city. Oh. Say, there's good gilt in that. Bet you boys are cutting up a nice profit, huh? What we clear-- and lately it's been very little-- we give to the poor. Well, that's a nutsy way to run an organization. Oh, uh, brother. Yes? Was the boss conning me about newspapers, that you guys never read them? Brother superior is right. We never read them. How about visitors? We very rarely have any. Boy, oh, boy. What a spot. Say, uh, tell me, uh... How does a guy join up with this outfit? Well, it's fairly easy. If a man wants to become a novice-- a which? A novice. They don't take holy vows. They have few religious duties-- chiefly, saying their prayers. They're not permitted to go outside the walls, and they must obey their superiors. Yeah. Well, what's the other catches? As a novice, a man must be on probation. That means-- yeah. I know all about probation. When can I sign? You'll have to talk to brother superior. Oh, and by the way, would you care to give us your name? Well, while I'm here, I think I'm going to let you guys call me lucky. Well, I'm afraid that wouldn't be acceptable in the Floracian order. It wouldn't, huh? I got it. This spot's got something to do with Flowers, huh? Yes. I always was a great guy for orchids. That'll be my new tag-- brother orchid. That's fine. We'll tell brother superior tomorrow. Now, meanwhile, you must try to sleep. Say, look, brother, could you slip me that paper and a pencil? Of course. There you are. And while you're writing, I'll go for a stamp and an envelope. Oh, thanks. Huh. Yeah. [Door closes] Dear Willie... Uh... Beat it for Kansas City... And stay there... For when I want to get you. I'm ok... And in a swell hideout... Run by the biggest chumps in the world. [Bell ringing] There. Thanks. I'm sure you'll be comfortable here. If you want anything, just call me. I'll be nearby hoeing potatoes. Hoeing potatoes? Say, don't you never get tired? You know, you've been sitting up with me 3 or 4 nights in a row now. That was because you needed me, but like all the brothers, I still have my regular work to do. You're a funny gee... And so is the rest of this mob around. You know, I don't get you birds at all. Our lives hold no mystery. We've merely learned that in doing things for others, it is we ourselves who reap the richest reward. Reward, huh? I figured there was a take somewhere. Hey, uh... Slip me the info. How does the dough actually get in here? No. There's no material gain. The reward I mentioned is the happiness that comes to the heart when a man knows he has been of service to another human. Hmm? I don't know whether you got something there or not. You make it sound right. Yeah, but the rules in the world I've been living in ain't like that. Perhaps you learned the new rules, and the old ones are so much better. There. You've talked enough. You mustn't waste your strength. If you need me, just call. Are you feeling better now? Yeah. Oh, hello. Hello, brother superior. Grab yourself a chair somewhere, will you? I want to talk to you. In just a few moments. Brother William's cut his foot with a rake. I must see him right away. Sure. But I'll hurry back. We should have a little chat. You're almost well enough to leave for the outside world. Hey, wait a minute. Didn't brother wren tell you I was thinking of signing up with your league? Brother wren did mention that you were thinking about becoming a novice. Sure. I gave him all the dope. I thought I'd be all set by now. You are. I wanted to make certain that your decision came from your heart. From the heart? Hey, now, listen, brother superior, you know, I've been giving this joint a double-o, and I met a lot of the inmates personally. You're all ok guys. Just you write your own ticket, and I'll sign. Ok, brother orchid. Splendid, brother orchid. Yeah. Say, I always was one who could wear a uniform. Are your sandals comfortable? Hmm? Oh, pretty nifty. Say, this is the first time I've seen shoes that are air-conditioned. Your hat, brother orchid. Oh, thanks. Genuine Kansas Panama, huh? Oh, ain't much, but I'll fix it up. I'll put a feather in it. Well, thanks, pal. Be seeing you. Well, well, now. I have a surprise for the brothers. What is it, brother superior? The roses brought $2.00 more than we anticipated, so as a reward, I've decided to take the money and give you all a treat. A treat? What's it gonna be? On Thursday for lunch, we shall have watermelon. First brother: Watermelon. Marvelous! Second brother: Watermelon? Why, we haven't had watermelon for over 2 years. Brother superior: It'll be quite a delicacy for us. What are you doing? Shaving your head, brother orchid. No, you don't. Do you have to? No. It's quite optional. Well, nothing doing. See, I got my looks to think about. Brother superior: Oh, come in, Joseph. Got a vibrator in the joint? A what? Oh, skip it. I know you ain't. Brother macewen will cut your hair in just a moment. Thank you, brother superior. By the way, you ought not to go barefooted. Your mother tells me you're just recovering from a cold. I haven't any shoes, brother superior. I was going to get them this week, but father was laid off. Have you no shoes at all, Joseph? Here, Joseph. Here are $2.00. You run into town and get yourself a pair of shoes. Brother macewen will cut your hair as soon as you get back. Gee, thanks! Come, my boy. Say, what about the watermelon? Watermelon? I never cared for it. Me either. It always distresses me. I get it. Nice mugs. [Milk squirting in bucket] How am I doing, pal? It's a miracle, brother orchid. No one else has ever been able to get as much milk from hildegarde as you. Just a certain touch I got, that's all. No. It must be more than that, brother orchid. It must be. Why? Because you have been with us such a short time, yet whatever you attempt, you do so much better than we who have been here for years. Oh, well, you boys don't want to get discouraged. You know, I always was just a bit better than the other guy. The only reason I ain't conceited about it is because I found it out when I was young. That still doesn't explain this milking of yours. I milked hildegarde for years, and do as I might, she never yielded more than 12 quarts a day. Yet from the first time you milked her, she gave 16. Well, that just sums up to one thing, pal-- I put a little more into my work and get a little more out. We bear wonderful news, brother orchid. Congratulations! Yeah? What about? Thanks to you, for the month just ended, hildegarde has yielded a total of 492 quarts. Brother: It's beyond belief. Brother superior asked us to tell you of your reward. Beginning tomorrow, you're to be given your own zinnia bed to cultivate all by yourself. Zinnia bed, huh? Is that good? Zinnias earn us most of our money in the Flower market this time of the year, brother orchid. You will have a grave responsibility. And I might add, that is the highest award our brotherhood can bestow upon a novice. No kidding, huh? Well, say, I sure appreciate that. With your permission, brother orchid, we'll go at once and spread the good tidings to all the brothers. Yeah, go ahead, pals. I want to be alone. Getting this honor makes me feel a little dizzy. [Brothers laughing] You know, these guys are so swell to me, hildegarde, I just ain't got the heart. Beginning right now, I'm only going to spike it 2 quarts instead of 3. It's not so much that they're the best zinnias we've ever grown, but it's the thought that brother orchid has raised them all by himself. It's remarkable, to think of him when he arrived, and then to realize that after 3 months, he's developed into one of our best workers. Yes, he is a changed man, and his work reflects the change, too. Look. Look. Aren't they beautiful? Brother superior: Congratulations, brother orchid. These are lovely, very lovely. Uh, thanks, brother superior. I was just telling brother superior how hard you've worked to raise them. Yeah. I am kind of tuckered out. I don't mind it. They're very beautiful, but you mustn't work too hard. Well, I can't help it. Them zinnias are just like my babies. Would you believe it? Sometimes in the middle of the night, I even catch myself wanting to get up and give them a drink of water. We're very proud of you, brother orchid. You're setting us all a splendid example. Thank you, warden-- I mean, brother superior. Guess I am giving you guys something to shoot at, huh? This being Wednesday, tonight after supper, I will deliver one of my informal talks. You shall be the subject. Yeah? Well, say, that's swell. Say, I'm glad you tipped me off. You know, I ain't taken a bow in so long, I'm afraid my back will creak. Continue with your work, brother orchid. Yeah. Thanks. [Whistles] Ok, kid, hop to it. You got a couple of more rows to hoe, then you can knock off for the day. Brother orchid, my father says I should ask you when you're going to pay me the 50 cents for last month. Oh, well, tell your old man not to worry, will you? Maybe tomorrow I'll slip you an i.O.U. That'll do you as much good as my check. Now hop to it, will you? As is customary, tonight I had planned one of my informal talks. My subject was to have been a brother who has been with us just a few months. Unfortunately, just before supper, an incident took place which makes it impossible for me to deliver the talk I had previously planned. What I am about to say pains me very deeply. We have worked together in Harmony for a long, long time, but now, for the first time in more than 20 years, I find I must publicly reprimand a member of this order. Brother orchid. Yeah? Just before this meal, Joseph's father came to see me. He tells me that his son has been working in your zinnia patch and that you now refuse to pay him. Is that true? [Muttering] Why, the little muzzler. Brother orchid, you are not answering the question. Has Joseph been doing your work? Well, no, not exactly. I had him toss a pail or 2 of fertilizer every now and then, but I couldn't help it. I'm allergic to it. There are times, brother orchid, when we appreciate your earthy witticisms. This is not such a time. I'm sorry. The fact remains that you promised Joseph money and you had no money with which to pay him. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We have 2 rules here, my friend. One--we do not hire others to do our work. 2--we do not make promises we cannot fulfill. You have hurt and shamed every man in this room, because, being brothers, we must all share your disgrace. That is all. Good night. Here. Wait a minute, now. I got something to say, too. You're all making me feel like I was a heel, and I don't like it. You know, not so long ago, I was out in the world looking for class and society. If anybody had told me then I'd get myself upset over a zinnia, gee, I'd have thought they was nuts. Whether you believe it or not, I worked hard over them Flowers, and I did all the work myself. I dug up that patch, I raked it, planted the seeds, watered them, pulled out the weeds, and when the Flowers started to grow, gee, I got a kick like I never had before, but you can't change a guy overnight. You know, I'm such a mug that was taught to look for angles. Take things easy, and you live a little longer. So a couple of weeks ago, I asked this kid to work for me. Well, I thought I was being awful smart. I guess... I guess it wasn't so smart. You may all retire. When the heart speaks, brother orchid, other hearts must respond. We're going to forget everything that happened. Are we? Tomorrow morning, this will be a closed incident. By the way, how much did you say you owe the boy? 50 cents. The world moves on. 20 years ago, for exactly the same work, I paid only a quarter. What's wrong, brother orchid? Are you ill? No. I'm all right. I'm all right. "Florence Addams, popular night club owner, "announced last night "that she would marry Clarence B. Fletcher, "wealthy Midwestern rancher, next week. "Miss Addams was once reported to be fiancee "of little John Sarto, gang leader, who was believed slain but whose body has never been discovered." Oh, so I'm a dead pigeon, huh? "Never in my life, miss Addams told reporters, have I been so thrilled and happy." Brother superior, would you do me a favor? Why, certainly, brother orchid. What is it? I've always wanted to know how the selling part of this business is run. How's about taking me to the market with you? Let me see... Yes. You've been with us long enough. I think you've earned a trip to the city. Get in the other side. Thanks. [Cranking engine] [Engine starts] You've barely spoken all the way in, brother orchid. Is the trip thrilling you as much as that? No, I ain't thrilled. [Whistle blows] Look, brother superior, I'm getting out here. Wait, brother-- I can't tell you now. I haven't got time. I'll meet you right here on the way back. Then I'll tip you off to everything. But, brother orchid, wait. [Rings buzzer] Oui, monsieur? Oui, yourself. Let me in! Don't stand there all gloomy. Where's your boss? Madame is at the beauty salon. Whom shall I say called? You don't have to say anybody called. I'm waiting. Thank you very much. Go on, now. Beat it. [Clank] Hey. What's the matter with you? It's me-- Little John! Johnny? Is it really you? You ain't dead. And if I am, I'm the livest corpse you ever seen. Come on. Get up. I got a lot of things to say to you, and I ain't gonna waste much time. Gee, Johnny, it feels like a guy's jumping rope in my stomach. Sure. That's the way all squealers feel when they meet the guy they put the finger on. Look, Johnny, I don't know where you been or what's happened, but there's one thing I gotta set you straight on right away. I didn't double-cross you that night at fat dutchy's. I wanted Jack buck to make up with you. He promised me he would if I got you up there, and I was dumb enough to believe him. Yeah? What do you think now? I'm dumb enough to believe you, huh? No, Johnny. You got to believe me. It's the truth, and I can prove it. Here. Read this. "The coppers ask any questions, "keep your mouth shut about Sarto. "They won't believe you got him up "to fat dutchy's to make up with me get smart and stay that way." Jack bucks' handwriting, all right. When did you get it? Last month, when the cops started looking for him. For what? The Tim O'Hara killing, a couple of policy knockoffs, and an income-tax rap. If the cops nail him, he'll get 100 years, maybe life. Well, well, well. So Jack buck's on the lam, huh? Where's he at? I don't know. Nobody knows his hideout. Yeah? Well, I might know something about that. Aw, Johnny, please don't be mad at me. I know I did a dizzy thing, but I was only trying to help you. I'm awful glad you're back. You don't know how I've missed you. If you ain't a screwball, there never was one. Why? You've missed me so much that tomorrow you're marrying another guy. Oh! Wait a minute, Johnny. When everybody said you was rubbed out, I went to pieces. Honest. Right to pieces. Clarence was swell. I mean, really swell. And later, when he asked me to marry him, I said ok, but I never said I loved him. I never said that to nobody but you. Now, look, will you call the whole thing off with Clarence? Of course, I don't know how he'll feel about it. He's got some friends here from Montana for the wedding, but I got a hunch he'll understand. Ok, then listen. Slip Clarence the news, and I'll be back in a couple of hours. We'll get married tonight, and shove off for Kansas City, where I already got Willie the knife planted. I'll get back in the harness and take over that territory. You with me? Oh, am I! All right. Now, finish packing, will you? I'll be right back. Johnny, wait a minute. What is it now? That outfit you got on. What did you do, join a convent? Certainly not. Then why are you wearing a wrapper? Ah... Oh. Hope I didn't keep you waiting long, brother superior. No. That's all right. [Whistle blows] I'm sorry I skipped away like that, but something happened that I had to take care of right away. No apologies are necessary, brother orchid. Uh, look, um... I got to get something off my chest, and I only hope you won't be sore. Well, first of all, I got to tell you that the last 6 months of my life were the happiest I've ever known. I'm very glad, and I hope you'll continue to be happy with us. Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. I won't be able to stay with you-- what's this? Ain't you sold the Flowers yet? What happened? That's why I'm so despondent. Our market is gone. They won't handle our Flowers anymore. What? Who won't? The wholesalers. As I understand it, we don't belong to the protective association. Protective-- did I hear you say protective association? Yes. I learned in the city today that not a Flower can be sold unless it's grown in their own nurseries. I don't know what we're going to do, brother orchid. I really don't. What protective association is this? I don't know. It's all so confusing to me. They did mention the name of some man wanted by the police. Buck? Jack buck? Yes. Yes, that's it. How did you know? It come to me in a dream. Hey, look, brother superior, will you move over to the curb for a minute? Please? Well... Brother superior, I'm gonna blab a little, then I'm gonna blow. Don't say nothing. Just let me talk. First of all, stop worrying about them Flowers. You bring them back to the market tomorrow morning, you'll find that nobody ain't gonna bother you never no more. You got my word for that. I accept your word, my son, but you-- please, brother superior, just let me finish. I, uh... I can't explain just why. It wouldn't do any good if I did. But I got to quit the monastery. My son-- now wait. You know, like I said before, I ain't never been so happy. I never met people like you, people who think of the other guy and forget about themselves. I've been living in a new world, and it's been awful swell, but, you know, sometimes with a mug like me, your new world and my old world just don't mix up proper, and I wish I could stay on forever, but I can't. So all I can say is so long and thanks. I'll send you back these robes as soon as I get some new clothes. Thanks for everything. But, my brother-- brother-- * close your sleepy eyes, my little buckaroo * * while the light of western skies * * is shining down on you [rings buzzer] * don't you know it's time for... * where's the boss? In the library with monsieur Fletcher. * So go to sleep, my little buckaroo * [men laughing] Johnny. I'd have been here sooner, only I had a little trouble promoting this suit from an ex-friend. Am I butting in? That's all right, Mr. Sarto. We were just talking about you. What we got to say I reckon we can say to your face. You told him? Why don't you let me and him alone just a few more minutes? Florence has told me everything, Mr. Sarto, and I come to realize you must have a powerful wrong impression of me. Yeah? How's that? I always believed you thought I was a pretty good fellow. Now I realize you also thought I was awful dumb! Now wait a minute, Clarence. Johnny didn't never say no such thing. Certainly I didn't. I never said anything about you. Never even thought anything about you. You proved that, Mr. Sarto, when you walked in here at the last minute and expect me to call off my marriage! So that's it, huh? So you think I'm cutting you out? Let me tell you something. Flo has been my girl for years. We've always been gonna get married, only it wasn't in the cards till now. You was the one who come along and butted in. Am I right? Is that right, Florence? Is that the way you feel? I've always loved Johnny, Clarence. I've got to call it the way I see it. I'm sorry I kicked up my heels the way I did, Mr. Sarto. I was just proud to believe I could make Florence happy. Now I'm just humble enough to realize you're the man to do it, and I wish you both all the good luck in the world. Well, shake. You're ok. You've got class, too. Can you imagine what I could have done with him in the organization, huh? Hey, wait a minute. What, Johnny? I got an idea. Uh, look, uh, those guys outside, are they your pals? My closest. They come in town to see my wedding. I don't know what they're going to do now. If they're here looking for excitement, I can dish them out plenty. Come on. I want a knockdown to them. You wait here a minute. [Men laughing] Boys, I want you to shake hands with Mr. Sarto. This is Tex Pearson, Curley Matthews. This here coyote's buffalo burns. How do you do? Glad to know you. Mr. Sarto's a good friend of mine. Him and Florence are-- let me do the talking, will you? I want to proposition these mugs. Look, it's like this, see? I just come from a monastery. I'm only in there on a rain check. Now I want to take a powder, see, but I can't because they're in trouble, and I don't want to leave them that way, understand? What particular brand of trouble? Well, it's like this, see? These guys at the monastery raise and sell Flowers. The dough they make, which you could put in your eye, they give away to the poor. That's mighty handsome. Mighty. I just found out that some mugs here in town are gonna make it tough for them. They ain't gonna let them sell Flowers anymore unless they shell out a rake-off. Maybe not even then. Why don't the fellows in the monastery do something about it? They can't, see? They're quiet, peaceful little guys that wouldn't hurt a bug. They can't fight, and they ain't got the dough to pull strings, understand? Too bad we ain't got these tough hombres to home. We'd sure know what to do with them in a minute. We wouldn't even bother the sheriff about them. We'd just ride them out of town on a rail. Clarence: We don't waste much time with bad men, Mr. Sarto. It takes almost half a day to bring a man in to court, and that's a powerful waste of time. Powerful. Well, cheer up, then. I'm gonna give you guys a chance to settle this in your own way. You mean we can run those tough boys out of town? You hit it right on the button, pal. I know where they're hiding out, and I'm going right down there to break them up. Now, you guys with me? [Men whooping] I'm in a rush, honey. I've got a little something to attend to. I know. I heard you talking inside. You're headed for trouble, Johnny, and I'm scared. What kind of malarkey is this all of a sudden? It ain't no malarkey. It's just that I don't want nothing to spoil what's maybe coming true after all these years. That's why I'm scared, Johnny-- because I'm awful stuck on you. Baby, when you speak like that, you're knocking on Johnny Sarto's heart with a sledgehammer. Now don't you worry. I'll be back before you know it, and then we'll be off. How does that make you feel? I'll tell you better when we're on the train tonight. Here's the elevator, Mr. Sarto. Johnny, wait a minute! I want you to carry this with you. What is it? It's a rabbit's foot, a lucky charm. My uncle wore it for 32 years. It's good luck, huh? Where'd you get it? From my mother. With her own hands, she took it off my uncle after they hung him. Come on, Mr. Sarto! Time's a-wasting! [Knock on door] Who is it? Mr. Clarence Fletcher. Name is Fletcher. Anybody know him? Not me. We're closed for the night. Come back in the morning. I got an important message. I reckon you'd like to have it tonight. What do you say? Let him in. What do we got to be afraid of? Howdy. Well, well, well. Look who's here. Remember him? Pattonsville sanitarium. Why, certainly. Certainly I remember him. You fellas look kind of familiar, at that. Sure we do. Come right in, Mr. Fletcher. Boy, are we glad to see you. Yeah. Remember what you did to us the last time? Yippee! [Punches being thrown] Keep punching them, cowboy! Ok, buck, come on out. Get 'em up. You knew just where I was hiding, didn't you? Well, you made a mistake. Not as big a mistake as you're liable to make. You were lucky last time, but you ain't gonna be now. [Alarm buzzing] [Fire alarm ringing] [Alarm ringing] Right in there, boss. All right! Break it up here! Come on, now! Hey! Break it up, all right?! Wait a minute! Mr. Sarto! He went in there! You said someone came in here. Mr. Sarto did. He was after Jack buck. Are you sure? I saw him. He came right-- hey, wait. Look! If you want Jack buck, come in and get him. Are you all right, Mr. Sarto? Yeah, I'm all right. You and me have got to go and talk to Flo. I don't think I better go up there, Mr. Sarto. After all, there isn't very much that I can say to Florence anymore. Now wait a minute, Clarence. Coming up here in the cab, I've been thinking a lot. You're the guy that's going up to see Flo. I'm breezing along. Yeah? Sure. Now look, pal. You turned out to be a real guy in my book, so I'm going to let down my hair. I haven't been on the level with Flo... Never. What are you saying, Mr. Sarto? She's a good dame and all that, but all the real love I got for her you could stick in your eye. I don't get you at all. I'm on the level. All this talk about me wanting to marry her is a lot of canal water. Man alive! To such a guy like me, love is like a scratch on the back. Sometimes it feels good, but a guy can't go along all his life with an itch. Florence is going to take this awful hard. No, she ain't, because you're going to be the guy to tell her. You know, between us, I was going to take her to Kansas City, get a couple of grand out of her, and then ditch her. That would be a pretty cheap thing to do, wouldn't it? Yeah, sure. That's why I changed my mind. I'm going to hop a freight and go away by myself. I got a friend there. I'll do all right. If it's a question of money, maybe I can help out. You sure could, pal. You could let me have a couple of c's. Sure, you bet. How much is a couple of c's? 200--$300. Here you are. Thanks, pal. Now go on up and do your stuff. I've been thinking. It might be easier on her if you sent some little message, something nice about her I could say you said. What are you trying to do, coax me to be a hypocrite? Now go on up there quick, before I change my mind and still clip her for a couple of grand. 12th Floor. Look, mom, you got any kids? No. I ain't got nothing. Well, you got something now. Brothers, there is good cause to be thankful this morning. I have just received the good news that there is no longer a protective association and that we may again sell our Flowers in the city. How this was accomplished I cannot tell you. All I know is that brother orchid gave me his word it would be done, and it was done. As you know, brother orchid is no longer among us. He has chosen the outside world, and none of us is wise enough to say that we are right and he is wrong. All we can do in our humble way is to wish him the utmost in heaven and happiness, and throughout our-- brother orchid, have you changed your mind? Yeah. Brother superior... All my life, I'm such a guy that was looking for class. I once went halfway around the world trying to find it because I thought that class came in dough and nice clothes and society. Well, I was wrong. I sure traveled a long way to find out one thing. This... This is the real class.
