Police system is a coin with two sides. One side is the law… and the other is order. Sometimes to maintain order, one needs to break the law. When order's maintained, the system functions properly. But we didn't know any of this in the Police Training Center. The real lesson on the system was outside the syllabus. And our dean Vijay Singh taught us the A, B, C of it. Knee up. Knee up. Inline with your waist. The future Bombay police. You can't even qualify as fake police in films. By the way, this is not dean Vijay Singh. He is our PT and Weapon's Instructor, -Mangesh Dixit. -Fire! Detail, five rounds. Application. Fire! If you manage to get a warrant before a raid or arrest, then consider it your lucky day. Crime and criminals are uninvited guests. No time to get a warrant. But the lack of search warrant can go against us in the court. -And this is our Law Professor, YP Mathur. -For example… A taxi was parked in the no-parking zone in front of a motel. A woman came out of the motel... and climbed in the back seat of the taxi. A man crosses the road and gets in the back seat of the taxi as well. Two sub-inspectors noticed the movement and searched the taxi in order to investigate. They found weed in the taxi. So, what do you think... the court ruled and why? Shukla! Sir! -Weed in the taxi. -Oh yes. Weed, sir, the policemen could have planted the weed in the taxi, to make a case. Stop talking like a police officer! Because you're not one yet. This is class, not a joke. Varde. Speak up. What did you want to say? Sir, we can't search them based on parking violation. Contraband was found in the taxi, and not with any of the accused. But I never said that they found the weed in the taxi or the vehicle and not with the accused. Sir, you just said, "weed in the taxi". Sir, this case is Vakil Khan versus -the state of Maharashtra. -Do you know about this case? Yes, sir. I read it in the library. This is not a Law school. Mugging up the case is not the objective. -Analysis should be on the stop. -Spot sir! On the spot, sir. All you’re good at is correcting the lecturers. But not yourself. So, listen, class… The dean was supposed to take the next class, but he won't. And this is me, Cadet Aslam Khan. Third bench from the last row, almost a back bencher in the class of '83. Dean Vijay Singh's first batch. Our first semester was nearly over, but no Cadet had ever seen dean Vijay Singh on campus. Bye. Here you go. He didn't take a single lecture. Shukla! Take one. All the way from home. We just got our very first telephone. I'm jerking off. I hope you don't mind dirty hands. Asshole. These blankets are rotated frequently. And the new dean, Mr. Singh, pays no focus on the Academy. I wonder if the blankets ever get washed. You guys never let me concentrate. Wanker! Shukla! It's bad luck to jerk off the night before the exams. What? Singh was a veteran officer of Mumbai Police. He eliminated many criminal gangs. Why would he be rotting here as the Dean if he was that good? He must be on punishment posting. Let it be. It doesn't really matter to us. It did matter to us. We were scared. Dean sir might not have taken a single lecture, but... we were all scared about the Dean's evaluation. Shukla. Right on the bullseye. But my instructions were one bullet on the bottom left, and another one on the bottom right. Bullseye is after all bullseye, sir. You dimwit. On the field, you're supposed to shoot only to disarm and not kill. Varde! Your target chart reminds me of my mother's crochet knitting. The criminal will end up paralyzed for life. Next! Come... -Mr. Jadhav. -Sir! What were you aiming at exactly? Such wastage of government funds. What exactly were you trying to do? Very good! Vishnu Varde. This is a review of your first semester. All the cadets are assessed on a total of 50 marks. In your case, with the dean's marks... -But the Dean was missing again. -...and remarks. Sometimes I felt that the training center administration floated a rumor to scare the cadets that Vijay Singh's been appointed as the new dean. So... you, me and Aslam topped the first semester. -Top? -From the bottom. The glass is half full. Change your perspective. -Correct. -Two more have joined our ranks. Jadhav... -and the other guy… -Surve… Who cares if there's a dozen of them? I wanted good marks for myself. I have a rich father. So even if I fail, I still have my family business. I'll take that up. Technically, we haven't failed yet. We managed to barely graze through. Honestly, I would have scored better marks, if Dixit wasn't always screwing with my… He shatters your self-confidence completely. Let's go break Dixit's balls. Do you want us to get rusticated? Only if we get caught. And who cares even if we do get caught. We aren't exactly ideal students. Bottoms up. -Let's do it. -Bravo! -What about you? -Will you give me a job? Done! Dean and Dixit got a whiff of Shukla's great plan. We had this great desire that the dean teaches us. And he finally taught us a lesson. Quite literally. Dean's entry was like a villain's entry in our life. IPC Section 107-117. When two or more people plan to execute a crime. You, you, and you. Your faces indicate you three were involved in some kind of incident. We haven't done anything, sir. That is what every criminal says. And the police's job us to establish a connection between the alleged criminals. And this, is the exact fact that criminals try to conceal. If anyone from the classroom would like to interrogate them, feel free to do so. Sir! Sir! Aslam, how did you get these bruises on your face? Sir! Last night, I woke up to go to the bathroom. But due to the rains and wet surface… -So... -Sir. Did Shukla tag along with you to the bathroom? No, I am quite capable on my own. Because Shukla has a bruised face as well. What were your whereabouts last night, Shukla? Few anti-social elements took advantage of the deluge and tried to enter the campus premises. And we… Any alibi? Me. Sir, when I saw Shukla tackling the attackers, I jumped right in to save him. What motive would the intruders have to infiltrate the training camp? To steal our arms and ammunition, sir. Our training weapon. And did the intruders tell you this? No! But that's the only thing worth stealing here, sir. Then why didn't you raise an alarm? You should've alerted the guard. We did. We tried doing that. But unfortunately, no one heard us in the deluge. And where did this scuffle take place? -PT ground. -PT ground. Sir, their night suits should be investigated. If, according to them, the struggle took place in the PT ground, their night suits should've traces of mud from last night. Yes, sir. If they are telling the truth, we'll definitely find stains. You'll find different kinds of stains on Shukla's clothes, sir. So, Shukla, Aslam and Varde… Shall we check your night suits? Sir… Sir, we are sorry. We lied. Sorry. If your motive was to lie, you should have soiled your night suits first. That would have saved you from getting caught in the investigation. Sit down. Rohan's second-term form. Sign on the dotted lines. He wanted to join the police when he was a kid. But the police department isn't what it used to be. Politicians are providing safe-haven to gangsters and criminals. Tell me something I don't know. Yeah, but the fresh recruits nowadays are smarter. They come mentally prepared for corruption. Right from their graduation. They are not romantic fools like us who set out from the academy armed with idealism. I tried to commit suicide. Have you heard about the 50-crore club? Twice. I couldn't handle this punishment posting, Sudha's death. Fifteen crores? Are you out of your mind? You just said 15 crores. I… I said 50 crores. 50. But that's not what I am talking about. I was talking about your suicide attempt. It was just a phase. It's over. Is it? It's not safe for you out here. -Just resign. -I said… It's over. A guy like you who loves fieldwork can only get frustrated out here. Anyway… You don't know how lucky you are. Lucky? Me? Are you being sarcastic? Out here, you get to see future policemen at their purest. Untouched by departmental politics and corruption. They're like wet clay. You can shape them the way you want. But you just said that the cadets these days are smarter and corrupt. There are always dark horses around. Where will I find those dark horses and romantics now? Sir! Nilesha ma'am sent these files for you. -Thank you! -Sir! In Bombay Police I mostly find more middlemen dressed as policemen. Well seasoned game players. To protect the good and destroy the evil! -Will you promise me something? -What? If anything happens to me… Don't… Let me finish. Never dye your hair black. Grey is beginning to suit you. Sir... Nurse, wait. Go, take the call. It's not urgent. Really? Then why did you leave the hospital's number with someone? Go, take the call. Where am I running away? Hello. Sotya speaking, sir. Sotya. Go ahead. Your hunch was correct, sir. They are meeting out in the sea. Kalsekar is on his way too. Rohan, tell your father to go do his job. He is not listening to me. Don't you want him to be here during your operation? I've already said what I want. At home, I am the boss. I was only shaving and not trying to kill myself. Might as well kill yourself. You are hardly seen around the academy anyway. I will haunt this academy. And possess you. Victory to thee, O'Hanuman! Ocean of wisdom All hail to you O'Kapisa Why did you call me? I asked for the files of those five lowest-ranking cadets. I thought I should review these once before rusticating them. You seem to have a lot of idle time, sir. I don't think these five need to become Policemen. Of course they don’t want to. Else, they would have strived harder. In the classroom, at the PT ground… I said they don't need to become Policemen. But they want to for sure... Without bowing to the system, or to you and me. Then, I don't know what to say. I was just like them in the academy. In fact, all the cadets used to be like them back then. Yes, all the cadets used to be like them back then. Then don’t let them continue here... Or some day they will be transferred here. On punishment posting. Better rusticate them. You are so negative. What can I do? Negative is in my blood group. What can I do either? I am B Positive. -Hence, I want to give a shot. -To all the five? To myself. As an experiment, I want these five to enter the police body as anti-bodies. Like a vaccine that counters disease. It will be illegal to train any candidate separately. We can improvise the syllabus slightly... and teach the entire class together. But the effect will only be on these five. I pity for you, sir. You and your experiments. These test tubes are going to blow off in your face. One-two-one-two-one... On the field, running after the criminal is your job. Understood? I want to see your knees inline with your waist -and energy. Come on, cadets! Come on! -Everybody on your feet, fast! Get into groups of three. Dixit will play the criminal for this exercise. Every group must complete three steps in 15 seconds. First, make him kneel or lie flat on his stomach. Second, restrain his hands at the back. And third, lock the handcuffs. Next! The matter didn't end after the beating we got that night... We were to be battered, and… humiliated. But Dean's style was different. Dean was a syllabus unto himself. He built up self-confidence in the five of us. We were made to think outside our boring books. One, two! Go! There were many rumors about the dean in our batch. Some said that the dean's informer network was faster than a computer. Some said that when dean gets angry, a volcano erupts somewhere. But there was no rumor about the Dean being an inhabitant of Jupiter. Now, I can't do anything. It's gone now. It's over. -Hello. -Vijay, speaking. How is Sudha? Kalsekar is going ahead for a meeting to strike a big deal. What do I do with him? How can you leave Sudha alone in her condition? Get him alive. Is Kalsekar's body among them? No. But he was here. Are you going back to the hostel? Please stay for a few more days. You didn't stay even for a minute for mother. Let me know when are we supposed to immerse her ashes. At any crime scene, your eyes will see what the criminal wants to show you. And what a criminal hides is the truth. This gap between hide and seek makes or breaks cases in the court. Thirty minutes. After that, the body has to be sent back to the mortuary. Not a single lesson taught by the dean was on the question paper. The other cadets turned out to be smarter than us. They had mugged up theory instead of dean's lectures. Shukla came for the exam without jerking off. To avoid any bad luck. -Happy new year, sir. -Happy new year. Happy new year, sir. -Happy new year, sir. -Happy new year, sir. Sir, when we had joined the academy, we wanted to learn a lot from you. -You're an inspiration to us, sir. -I see. What is so special about me? Sir, during your posting in Bombay, you wiped out many gangsters. Yes. You boys read a lot of newspapers it seems. Learning under you is nothing short of an honor, sir. You think you are honoring me by scoring the lowest in your class? So far whatever second-semester papers I have assessed... you boys are going to score the lowest again. Sorry for disturbing you, sir. -Wait a minute. -Yes, sir. -Do you boys know about cleaning up? -What, sir? People say the last day of the year is a reflection of your days to come in the new year. Surve, grab my sweater. You three... could have been rusticated for entering my home that stormy night. Do you know? We know, sir. But for us, our friendship... mattered first. And it also mattered that we should fear none. Not even... our teachers. All bodies have an immune system. Government bodies, educational bodies, judicial bodies… These are strong fortresses. And their immune system is so strong that any attack from the outside never affects them. They need to be rotted from the inside, like a disease. Sir, if any of this was possible, wouldn't you have already done it? I burnt my hands by mistake. But you should not repeat the mistakes I made. Six of our brave officers died in their effort to apprehend international smugglers. And I promise you that those who are guilty will be brought to justice. Our chief minister Mr. Manohar Patkar has always supported the police department of this state. I request the wives of the six martyrs to come on stage... so mister minister could present them with a cheque of rupees 100,000 each. First I would like to call the brave wife of sub-Inspector Siddesh Naresh Sawant. Kalsekar knew we were coming. He fled in a hurry without even putting out his cigarette. Did someone tip him off? I was the only one who knew about operation against Kalsekar? Then who? And the only other person I told about the operation against Kalsekar was you. These are the key members of Kalsekar's gang. Killing them is like saving Bombay from a disease. And killing them without drawing Patkar's attention is like winning a war. Patkar has always protected gangsters like Kalsekar. His entire gang thrives because of Patkar. Every policeman in the state is scared of Patkar's punishment posting. That's why no police officer dares to lay a finger on Kalsekar or his gang members. When CBI planned a raid to apprehend Kalsekar… it was Patkar who leaked this internal information to him. Kalsekar escaped... ...leaving India forever. Soon his gang members fled too. You have the will to kill, but out on the field, what matters is the skill to survive. You are loyal friends, but also honest. You break rules, but not principles. You fail but on your own terms. If these weaknesses remain your assets... and if you continue to remain loyal friends… Then I'll eagerly wait right here to hear about what you do out in the field. Our Maharashtra state has Police Force of 60,000. And from today you will all be part of this formidable Force. From now, the responsibility of protecting the citizens of Maharashtra is on your shoulders. I want to congratulate all of you on your graduation. And I would like to request your dean to say a few words. Our respected Chief Minister has given me this opportunity to share my experience with you and for that, I am grateful to him. Minister Patkar has worked for the betterment of our state. Thanks to minister Patkar's encouragement, every policeman of our state fights criminals without any fear. First platoon march forward... in quick steps. One... two... First platoon look right. Dean's faith in us was a big burden on my heart. It must have laid heavy on the rest of my friends as well. Dean had taught us the A...B...C of the system. But now life was going to test us. And it wasn't going to be easy. And life can be more cruel than any Vijay Singh. Bombay. This city was nothing short of a battlefield. The city's backbone were the cotton mills, Where labour strikes were more frequent than the usual work. The real fight was between Indira Gandhi and trade union leader Datta Samant. And the collateral damages... ...were 250,000 mill workers and their families. -Out Cotton Loom is our Birthright! -It's not your private Heirloom! Out Cotton Loom is our Birthright! And the mess didn't end there. Terrorism is at its peak in Punjab... And terrorists were smuggling in weapons and explosives via Bombay Port. Fresh on postings, we soon realized that Bombay was the underworld's circus, and Kalsekar its ringmaster. On top of that unemployed young children from mill workers’ families were also taking to crime. The prominent one among them was Naik gang. The entire city was sitting on a pile of gunpowder. All it needed was someone to strike a matchstick. Dean Singh was perhaps waiting in Nashik to hear about our field achievements. But we newly posted officers were like the 12th man in cricket. Whiling away in Control room, or at airport. Or rotting as some minister’s family’s personal security. Raman Singh. Vishnu Varde. -You are with Delhi Police? -Yes! Almost back-benchers in police system. The tourism minister is in Bombay for some work. He has brought his son along too. The young man's partying. So, Varde. Word in your circle is that you're being assigned to some decent post. I don't know. But if it's true, I am going to miss you all. Like hell, he is going to miss us. Good. -Shukla sir. -What? ACP sir is calling you. I'm coming. -Shukla? -Sir! Your colleagues claim that you have a great aim. Thank you, sir. The department is thinking of giving you some solid work instead of regular duty. Sir. What's in the file? Paperwork, sir. Routine paperwork. Look, Shukla... -remember one thing. -Sir. No matter what you do, never let any blemish come to your uniform. Don't put the department's honor at stake. -Right? -Sir. -Great. -Sir. Rohan. Oh, God! Put me down. Who did this? Hold this. Of course. Yours, truly. It's a bad knot. First mills owners were using gangsters against workers to disrupt labour strikes and to kill union leaders. And now, a conflict of interest has erupted between mill owners and gangsters. Because the real estate value of mill land is hitting the sky. Do you remember the lecture on organized crime that we read in our Academy days? I am not the one who ended up as a teacher. Gangsters organize their setup in such a way, so that no evidence trail leads back to the bosses of the gang. The Police gets their hands only on low level gang workers and sharpshooters. So? Why can't the police follow the same model? How? Bombay police needs a squad. It will consist of officers from sub-inspectors, inspectors ranks And these officers will have the freedom to kill gangsters without any restriction of jurisdiction. And their seniors will get punishment posting or suspension. Like you did. Only if the evidence trail leads to the top brass of the department. The institutionalized killing of gangsters by policemen. Here's what I think. You should write a novel. Or your biography. What are you doing? Hey! -Say yes. -Come on. No! -Promise me that you'll think about this. -Never. Look, if I stand, you'll fall. Vijay, don't be childish. I already have a dislocated hip. Put me down, please. It's a swing, not the weighing scale of the law. Raghav, Kalsekar's monopoly won't last so long. Naik gang and other such children of other unemployed mill workers... are going to organize their criminal outfits soon. Kalsekar is not a part of our police department's syllabus anymore. Patkar tore that chapter out. -Fish is delicious. -Yes! Wow! What happened to your forehead? The Kohinoor Mill lockout. The workers resorted to stone pelting. Hey, get some sauce. Bunch of imbeciles. -They will all die, the stone pelters. -What did you mean? Varde, you do know that my father is a mill worker. The mill owners duped workers of millions worth of their wages. Correction, not the mill owners, the union leaders duped them. And the workers took no time in raising the communist flag. And now they are all starving. Tell me something. We'll be heading towards capitalist economy at some point. Do you think this socialists' slogan shouting trend will last? Stop chewing my brains, Varde. Why are you raising your voice? You want to show your attitude? Varde… enough, Jadhav. -Varde. -He does this all the time. What “all the time”? We're in a public place. Enough. What did I say to him? Don't be stupid. We barely meet. Stop this nonsense. Enough. He said my father will die. I meant the system. Listen first. Fine… whatever was said and done. End of conversation. -Over. -Quiet. People are watching. -I didn't say anything. -Now apologize. Why me? Do you have a problem? Come on, Varde. Apologize. Jadhav. Sorry. I don't want your apology. I just said sorry. You are right. About the union leaders, the system. But… I feel bad for my father. He is naive. This system... will scrounge every last drop from these workers and chuck them on the side. Like the system did to Singh sir. Chucked him aside. Who served me this crab? Take it away. Don't ever order crab again. Looks huge, but no meat. What is this? What? Yes, how much? Wait. Shukla. I already said I'll pay the bill. Please visit again. What was that? -Bye... -Bye... -Varde? -Yes. -The dinner was amazing. -Right. No doubt. It was delicious. Hey, what's wrong with him? Ismail Pathan. Surve, he handles Kalsekar's money laundering business. But hadn't he escaped to Dubai? Yeah. If he dies, there will be no one to launder the money to Kalsekar in Dubai. If we want to do something, then this is our only chance. Before he flees back to Dubai. This is not our jurisdiction. Not ours, then let's call someone who works in this jurisdiction. Every time I saw a film Even I wanted to be a movie star Hold on. One last rehearsal. Say nothing about Pathan. Because any police officer can be on his payroll. Right. All we say is that a murder suspect from my jurisdiction… A murder suspect from your jurisdiction is in this area. We need help, we need backup. Send someone now. -Not a word about Pathan. -No! That's it! Spare me some alms. Pramod Shukla. -You... -Kohinoor Mill Lockout. -Where is the suspect? -He is inside the shrine. My colleague is keeping an eye on him. Okay. Let’s go in then. No need, please relax. We'll handle him as soon as we get the signal. Okay. Spare me some alms. My other slipper is missing. Who took boss's slipper? Who was it? Spare me some alms for the love of God. Sub-inspector Surve. Rastogi. My hands are not clean. Shukla, go inside. He's on the other side of the food stall. Go get a pair of slippers. Can I get you something, sir? Soup, minced meat or pilaf? Pathan, I'm a sub-inspector. Did you really think you can sneak in and out of Bombay overnight, and we won't even get a whiff? Which police station are you from, son? None of your business. I guess you didn't receive your share. Money? I don't want money. Perhaps not money, then what else do you want? You'll get it. Come with me without a word. So, you want to take me to the police station? Yes. I'll take you there and book you. Now start moving or I will drag you all the way. Bastard. No manners. No respect for elders. Get the car. We'll show this cop what an arrest at Pathan's godown feels like. -Pathan! -Hey! You shot him point-blank! -Why didn't you follow the procedure? -We did, sir. Pathan was abducting Inspector Varde. Forcibly. Why did Varde go after him? Sir, we spotted a murder suspect from my area. Case file number 307. Mahim is not our jurisdiction. So, we called Inspector Rastogi for backup. Yes, sir. But sir, I had no clue that Pathan was there. We didn't know either. Rastogi sir? Sir, we were following the murder suspect. But we lost him in the crowd and spotted Pathan instead. And once we spotted Pathan what should we had done? Let him go? Especially when Rastogi was there to help. Eye-witnesses have testified saying, Pathan didn't have any weapons. In fact, his men never drew any weapons. Sir, these local people’s loyalties lie with Pathan.They'll never tell the truth. And I fired first two shots at his legs. To warn him. Sir, Pathan had a gun. He held it against my waist. It's bruised. See for yourself. Come on, leave. Take a look first. My skin is completely bruised. I know. Your skin's bruised. Now out. All of you. Sir! Sir… what do you have to say about Pathan's killing? Sir, did the police know that Pathan was in India? -We can't tell you. -Sir, when did Pathan come to India? Sir, please… What are you doing? Your skin is actually bruised. Hey, Varde, did Pathan actually stick a gun to your waist? We had made a mistake once. When we didn't soil our tracksuits in the mud. But this time I did. Hail Singh sir. Let's go. The matchsticks struck by the dean had lit their first fire. But Pathan was sheer lottery. We had got him by luck. But getting the other key members of Kalsekar's gang wasn't going to be a cakewalk. Where guns don't work, one should work as termites, Dean sir had once said. So, we started killing Kalsekar's small-time crooks. So... Are you still in touch with your first batch? Class of '83. I get a new batch every year. They are all my students. No contact -with anyone whatsoever? -No. Why? Nothing! Many of Kalsekar's men were shot dead in the past couple of years. And behind each killing was… one of your students. We don't have any lesson named “Kalsekar” in the syllabus here either. I just focus on the syllabus. But a blow to Kalsekar meant... a blow to Minister Patkar as well. Patkar had the press in his pocket. The press started screaming blood. Accusing police of human rights violations and to put extra pressure DGP Raghav Desai was summoned to the secretariat. There are serious matters in the intelligence report. This could embarrass the entire Police Force. These encounters… I'm held accountable at the Parliament. And on the other hand that gangster Naik. Naik is trying to encroach into Kalsekar's territory. This can lead to a gang war. Sir. I had a vague idea. Let's make a special squad. We'll recruit handpicked PSIs and PIs, and they will have the permission to act even outside their jurisdiction. Punjab model. The evidence of these killings won't reach any DCP, DGP, IG or ministers. None of us will sign any orders. You really earned your post, Raghav. Thank you, sir. But there is one problem, sir. This squad cannot just kill the members of Naik gang. We also have to target the Kalsekar gang Only then will it look legitimate. Okay. Jai Hind, sir. DGP Raghav cleverly presented Dean sir's idea as his own. The press, that were hurling accusations at us, now made us heroes. But Kalsekar's gang was not some ordinary gang. We killed one of his, and Kalsekar would give charge to someone more notorious of that area. It was a game. Kalsekar was the player and we were amateurs. One day, we received a tip that Chhota Naik is coming to the dockyard. Quite possibly it was Kalsekar who had tipped off the department about Naik. Because Naik... could have become the next Kalsekar. Sir… Please let me go. -I didn't kill anyone. -Who is he? Chhota Naik. Let him go. He doesn't work for Kalsekar. As the saying goes, Naik and Kalsekar... are enemies. Jadhav and I didn't report Shukla and Varde letting Naik go. I got a hunch though. While cleaning up crime for Dean sir Shukla and Varde were themselves going to get sucked into some sewer of crime. Please, sir. This way. Actually, it's the 150th year of our newspaper. 150th year. And we are giving some special guests a tour of our press. -Am I special? -You are special to us. Your photo will be published on our "City" page. And the photographer is waiting for you. -That way? -Yes. Actually, sir, we have come up with a very interesting headline for you. Headline is, "Dirty Harries of Bombay". -Who is this Harry? -Are they going to call you "dirty"? Actually, ma'am, dirty Harry is a famous policeman of America. He may be. But my husband is not dirty. It takes an awful lot of detergent and tinopal to keep his uniform clean. Don't print any nonsense. -Understood? -Yes, sir. Sir, please come this way. This is a sample layout of your piece. Take a look, sir. This one. My photo and name will come here. Do you have your gun? Just for the pose. For the pose. What is this? Sixty-five? You did 65 encounters in the last three years. Am… Am I right? I said 72. Sir, you said "round about 72." That's why when I was interviewing Varde sir, I cross-checked with him. And he said he did 55 and you did 62. The Dombivali shootout was actually Varde sir's. I mean he only told me that. Doesn't matter, sir. I… I put in a round figure instead. 65. -See. -Varde said that? -Yes, sir. -Varde said that. He just told you. You don't believe when your wife says it. Sir… Shall we, sir? Sir? -Yes? -Shall we? Photographer is waiting. Listen. Do one thing. Print this article without me. -Without your photo? -No photo, no name, don't mention a word about me. Write about the rest. How is that possible, sir? Everything is ready. The negative, the rough proof, its all ready... Sir... Are you going to teach me about proof now? What are you doing, sir? No, sir. -Are you going to teach a policeman now? -No. Let's go! The numbers game caused a rift between Shukla and Varde. Kalsekar took advantage of their rift and approached Shukla with an offer. And Naik gang poached Varde to their side. Welcome. Welcome… happy Eid. Sister-in-law, this is Sakina. -Congratulations for the engagement. -Thank you. When money talks, a lot of mouths get shut. Jadhav and Surve too dipped their hands in the river of money. And no one in the department had the guts to put a stop to its flow. Food is delicious. Come here, little Shukla, looking handsome. Little Shukla is dressed in traditional attire. Wonderful! You are looking good in this outfit. Son, here you go. Your gift. Don't, Varde. You will spoil him. What do you mean I'll spoil him? This is not Kalsekar's money that he will get spoiled. What do you mean? We're friends. We're family. Nothing is hidden from us. -Nothing is hidden? -No. And what about you who takes credit for my encounters? Behind my back. Without me, you would be behind the bars. "Credit..." You're out in the open because of me. Legal planning, angle, -that's all me. -Varde. Shukla. Shut your mouth and eat. This is my home. I don't want a scene here. There are ladies inside. One should think -before acting. -Correct. Kalsekar pays him and off he goes killing his enemies. -No brains, just bang... bang... bang. -Shukla. Why don’t you tell him to stop it Aslam? What is he going to tell me? What? He knows I am telling the truth. Stop it, Varde. Stop it. -You're a liar! -Liar? -Naik paid you, didn't he? -How did Naik get in all this? He wants to take credit. My credit. Bloody lying bastard! -Pramod, what's going on? -Go! -Sister-in-law, please-- -Nothing, Sister-in-law. You see, he's a compulsive shagger. He can only bark but won't bite. Varde, you asshole... you bloody... -One minute. -How dare you? Bastard! Stop it. Listen to me. You will die. Bloody pimp. How dare you! Stop it... listen to me. You can't even handle a gun! I have no right to suggest. Just… consider this a request. Name her Sudha, if you don’t mind. Yes, father. The boss of the house is back. Hey! You're late, Mr. Local Guardian. I am here to see you. What happened? Three innocent businessmen died in a police firing. Shukla, Varde, and other members of the squad are also involved. They claim that they mixed up and confused the car model for another. Did you suspend them? It's not about the suspension. It's about bringing them to justice. And as usual, they've covered their tracks pretty well. That's why the department is finding it very difficult to nail them in an inquiry. You trained them. No one knows them better than you. Chief Minister wants you back on the job. You've to resume your duty. A long ago I left from a hospital to do my duty. It changed my entire life. I know. It might change again… hopefully for the better this time. Your granddaughter has brought you luck. This squad was your idea. Now rein it in. It is said that when the river Ganga came down from the skies to drown the earth... the heavens summoned Lord Shiva to rein it in, to stop its destruction. Dean's entry in our life was just that sort... a hero's entry. This is Air India Radio, and now news from Bombay. The case of three businessmen who died in police firing is still a hot topic in the parliament. Human Rights Commission and the opposition are demanding Inspectors Pramod Shukla, Vishnu Varde, Janardhan Surve, and Laxman Jadhav, to be taken in judicial custody. Chief Minister Mr. Manohar Patkar and police department have assured a change in the inquiry commission. You faces indicate that you were involved in some kind of incident together. We were just doing our duty, sir. I received a tip-off about a blue Sedan arriving near Bhaucha Pier The passengers in the car were supposed to be carrying AK-47 rifles. Didn’t your informer tell you the vehicle number? He did, sir. But it was only partially correct. Even my informant gave me the same tip. Why didn't you two cross-check the number with each other? I had no clue that Shukla is going after them too, sir. Do you think it’s a game of race? We had information on dangerous criminals being in that car, sir. Since the collapse of insurgency in Punjab, a lot of their AK-56 and AK-47 rifles are finding their way to black market... right here in Bombay. Is this the excuse that you have prepared for the families dead businessmen? It was their bad luck, sir. The committee has also mentioned that you were on the gangster's payroll. The department has nicknamed you as "The 100-Crore club." The department is jealous of us. They are lying. Which gangster offered the money first? They all do, sir. From time-to-time. Kalsekar did, sir. Kalsekar made the first offer... to Shukla. Go on. For the record, sir… Let me clear that for you. I didn't take money from anyone, sir. And if a policeman gets paid to kill a gangster, then I don't see anything wrong in it. Right, sir? Absolutely right, sir. Gangsters offer us money to kill members of their rival gangs. And that money can help us... if the department transfers us to a punishment posting. We know what they did to you. And it happened, because you didn't know how to play the game. It's an offense to hit any policeman. Hit, sir? We didn't hit any policeman, sir. None of us did, sir. No sir. I haven’t either. Yet. But today, my hands are itching. And since you commented that I don't know how to play games, then let me tell you. What can one do if he's better than his colleagues, if he's better than the system? Should one then choke his talent to death? And become mediocre like the members of some 50-crore or 100-crore club? I have asked myself this question again and again over the years. I have cursed myself for my abilities. And if anyone could help me get rid of my abilities, like some disease... then I would have grabbed his help. So, its good that whatever you learned from me, at least you didn't pick my lack of ability to play the game. If we had, we would be long dead. Then even our blood would have been on your hands. And you already have a lot of blood on your hands. Sir, what action is being taken against you? When is Inquiry Committee going to hold a press conference? Yes, sir. When will it happen? Sir. We must resume the work we had started... against Kalsekar gang. At the moment I can only trust you, Aslam. You must head this operation. This involves a lot of risk. What I'm going to show you... has to be kept confidential. Aslam, can you form a team of clean policemen? I am sorry to say, sir, but clean policemen usually don't have a strong informant network. I used to have a very reliable informer network of trusted postmen. All the corruption charges against me are baseless. My home was searched, my in-laws' home was raided. But no unaccounted cash turned up anywhere. International calls and STD calls are expensive. They are not viable for the lower members of any gang. But they send letters, use money-order service to send money home. And telegrams in case of an emergency. Post department has information about every trunk call, letter, and telegram. And postmen know every street, every lane in the city. They walk the streets of this city all day. And no one ever suspects them. I killed only history-sheeters. They had criminal records. In a few cases, you killed footpath dwellers, and mutilated their faces to set off some existing case files. -That's the allegation against you. -Allegation? Do you have any evidence? Did you get married? I've a fiancé. Wedding is just around the corner. Congratulations. Thank you. With the help of Dean sir's secret informer network, we found evidence against Kalsekar gang's key members. Some of them agreed to depose as eyewitnesses. We made arrests. We made cases. ASLAM KHAN GETTING FAME FOR DEMOLISHING KALSEKAR'S GANG When will it be ready? It's the wedding season, aunty. And your job order came in late. My son is married to his duty. He couldn’t take time out. Girl, would you want to marry a boy like this? My father has two wives. They both get along pretty well. I will adjust with his job. -The sherwani suits you. -Thank you! Are you always this quiet? Speaking too much is bad for health. -Hey! Those goons… -Hey! Aslam! Hey, kids. You think you can snatch chains in broad daylight. Do you think you own the city? Give it back. Narayan Shetty! I've stolen your chain... Let's sneak behind the church You little rat. Which gutter were you hiding in with your boss Kalsekar? You bloody... When rats come out of gutters, plague spreads. A lot of people die. A lot of people. -You think you can kill a policeman? -Yes! -You think Bombay Police will sit quiet? -Yes! We're going to kill you and your boss in your homes. Squad. Slope arms. Present arms. Fire! Fire! Fire! Looking for an easy death, sir? I hope you didn’t put soil on his grave with your dirty hands. Just get us to Kalsekar and Shetty. Then we'll kill you in any which way you like. We’ll even give our lives for you. We'll give whatever statement you want us to give to the Inquiry Committee. But please… we have to do this for Aslam. You want me to believe in you two again? Give you two another chance! Not to us, sir, give yourself... another chance. Your shattered test tubes can’t blow off anymore sir. I had a wish… to be an officer like Dean sir . To have his qualities. That wish died with me. But if my death can make Dean sir and these fools trust each other again… then my death would be worth it. Who could have imagined the Cotton Mills would just vanish from the face of Bombay. Cotton, the King of Bombay. The Jumania Builders are developing this land. But the real owner is my son-in-law. I am setting him up in the real-estate business. Anything else? Umar Kalsekar. You crippled his business. You killed his people. Only that Shetty is left in his gang. Now stop this all. Are you setting up Kalsekar in real estate too? Kalsekar doesn't need me for that. He's bought a piece of mill land too. Not this one... it’s some other mill, using some builder as a front. Give Kalsekar some time. Soon he’ll go white-collar-- He’s not even worthy of a dog collar! Tell Kalsekar to come to India and surrender. -Then he’ll probably live. -Are you so naive? Any gangster can operate from inside the jail. Eight years ago I helped Kalsekar by transferring you to a punishment posting. This time I am trying to help you, and you're walking out on me. You can transfer me to a punishment posting again. You both are alike. You and Kalsekar. I sent you to a punishment posting, sent you away from Bombay. But let me tell you, I realized one thing. I have authority over you. My rank is superior, But I have no power over you. Neither over you, nor over Kalsekar. Any minister in my position would have done the same thing. You, me… We are all disposable. Najma is Kalsekar's sister. She doesn’t have a child of her own. Kalsekar's given his daughter in adoption to Najma. -Two chocolates? Okay! -Yes! -No… -No… -Let's go. -No! -Let's go. -No! Come on. Hurry up! Tell Kalsekar that he must come and meet us if he wishes to see his daughter alive. That's all. Nothing else is written on it? No, brother. Nothing else. That's it. There is this imported cigarette bud though. Seems pretty old. It's eight years old. I know where she is. Varde. Leave something for Dean sir as well. For me... this will do. As you wish, sir. I am not even sure if Kalsekar will show up based on such a cryptic letter. Let's go. Hello. Jai Hind, sir! -Singh here. -Jai Hind. What is it? I just wanted to say that I'll always be grateful to you for your good deeds. -Singh, are you all right? -Working under you, I learned a lot. The work that you did for this country and state… What on earth are you saying? Even I would like to do some good work, so the department gets a sound reputation. Have you lost your mind? Get yourself treated. Every police... That Singh... He's lost his mind. Here I am. Isn't this what you wanted? When it comes to your family one can’t stay in hiding for long. Isn't that right, Kalsekar? Is this coming from you who ignored his family and kept chasing me? All these years… This war was between you and me. Why did you involve women and children in it? Where... is my daughter? I choked her to death. And threw her in the sea. Don't expect me to go soft on you in the inquiry. Naik, be ready. Let's go. If this is your doing… then God help you, Singh. Me, sir? At that moment I was at the GPO, sir. Talking to you over the phone. Police system is a coin with two sides. On one side is the law and on the other is order. And sometimes, to maintain order, one has to break the law. When order is maintained the system functions properly.
