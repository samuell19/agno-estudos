Seems we never received your quarterly funding reports. I'm in the process of getting those to you. Give me by the end of the day, and you'll have an email. Okay, Mr. Mazzetti. But your other problem is I just heard Gabriel Cavallero was killed last night, which means you no longer have an engineer instructor for this program. Yeah. Um, I have someone available to take his spot, so there's no need to worry about that. Hm. Tell you what I can do for you, Mr. Mazzetti. Have those reports and new engineer instructor by Monday, or I'll have no other choice but to give this grant to another program. Do you understand? I'll take care of it. I expect to hear from you soon, Mr. Mazzetti. Have a good day. Chicken, rice and veggie is your favorite food. Why aren't you eating, baby? Grandma says my hair looks just like my mom's. Yes, baby.

[match commentary running on TV] [distorted voice] I got you on camera robbing Maxim Cavallero. Now, you have three options. I can tell him who you are, which I know you don't want, you can go back to prison, or you can follow these instructions. You're a smart man, you'll make the right decision. [newscast starting] In our top story tonight, the body of 20 year old Gabriel Cavallero was found gunned down near the Eriko refinery. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators have reason to believe this was not a random attack. In other news, the body of notorious gang leader Cordell Black McCall was found this morning. McCall's forehead was marked with the signature X of the East Side cartel. Police speculate this is a turf war between the South side Boys and the East Side cartel. Authorities at this time have no suspects in custody. These homicides mark the 15th and 16th homicides of the year. Bianca Cervantes, CTSC Channel 11 News. [shimmering] [exhaling] Hello, sweet baby.

Man, you know them Linguini-eating motherfuckers trying to take over our shit, right? Yep. Man, no bitches ain't taking over shit. If they want to go to war, we going to take 'em to war. You know them motherfuckers killed Black. They put a X on his head just to let us know who did it. Man, fuck Black! You think I give a fuck about Black? He was doing business with them guido, gwap, goomba motherfuckers, man. So what you want to do, Trey? [music playing distantly] Look, I need everybody to keep their guards up right now, and report back to me any disruptions in our operations. And if y'all see one of them spaghetti, ravioli-eatin' motherfuckers in our territory, smoke they ass on site. MAN: What's up with this? Every time I come down here, it's a different bill. [Jada] Or you could speak to my manager. I ain't speakin' to no manager. I'm out of here. - [Jada] Oh. Hey, Mario. - Um, hi, Jada. I'm here to pay my mom's bill again. Yeah, okay. So... here's 200. [Jada] Yeah, that will do. Oh, by the way, Jada? Do you know Mrs. Lopez that lives next door to us? - [Jada] Mhm? - Apartment number six? Yeah, I know her. Can you tell me how much her bill is? 'Cause I've seen her going across the street to the neighbor's just to get a bucket of water. So, uh, I think her water's off or something. - [Jada] Yeah. Hold on. - [phone ringing] Yeah. I'm really not supposed to do that, but for you this time, um, one second. Yeah. She's, like, three months behind. They cut it off, like, last week. Um, how much is it? [Jada] Let me check for you. Let's see. One second. [Mario] Thank you, by the way. - Um... - [phone ringing] With the late fees, I can wave those, we're looking at like 175. Um, all right, you know what? Here's... Here's 300. That should be enough to cover her next bill when it's due. That's really nice of you, Mario. You tell your mom I said hi, okay? - All right, thanks Jada. - All right. - Hey, what's up, Rico? - [Rico] Hey, Mario. Next, please. [Mario] Aight man, take care, all right?

That's what I've been trying to tell you guys. You got to be focused to make this thing happen. Now, he's not here, but it's slowing up everything. I got that beat you gave me a while ago, can I just finish that? Sure. Let's get it. Jennifer, you up. All right. Hey, Ant. That ain't like Rio to just miss class, man. Something ain't right.

[Burns] Excuse me, Miss Clark. Hello, gentlemen. Did you find out why my business card was at the bingo hall? No, not yet. We are here to ask some questions about one of your students. One of my students? Which one? Mario Hernandez. [teachers] Mario. What did he do now? We don't know. He was murdered earlier this morning. - [gasping] - Oh, my God. No! Mario, murdered? Oh, my God. Have a seat, Miss Clark. Mario, no! Mrs. Clark, when was the last time you saw Mario? I saw him here yesterday at school. [Hollister] Did he say if he was having any trouble with anyone? No, not to me. Do you think any of your students would know of his whereabouts last night? I don't know, but we can ask them. They're at the recording studio with their instructor, Mr. Hunter. Where is that? That's three blocks away at 1651 Martin Luther King Way. Mrs. Clark, we're also here to investigate another homicide of a Gabriel Cavallero. We was told he was working here. He did. Do you think the two were connected? We don't know. That's what we're here to find out. Do you still have my card? Please. If you can think of anything, anything at all, please give us a call. - I will. - Thank you, Mrs. Clark. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Clark. [hip hop instrumental] Hey, Mr. Hunter. Police just pulled up. Aw, thanks, Shawn. Kevin Hunter? Yeah, I'm Kevin. Um, we'd like to ask you a few questions outside. Okay, uh, y'all keep this going, it sound great. I'll be right back. - [Jennifer] What's that about? - [indistinct] I'm Detective Burns, this is my partner, Detective Hollister. We're here to investigate a homicide. A homicide? Yeah. Mr. Hunter. Mario Hernandez was murdered this morning. What? How? What happened? We're trying to figure that out. When was the last time you saw Mario Hernandez? I saw him yesterday, here in the studio. Did he say where he's going after class? No. I mean, not to me he didn't, but I know he was with some other students when he left. Can we talk to these other students? Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on. All right, everyone. I need you to listen up. I'm afraid I have some... Some terrible news. What's wrong, Mr. Hunter? I'm so sorry to have to tell you guys this, but Mario was killed this morning. [all exclaiming] And this is Detective Burns and Detective Hollister. They'd like to ask you guys some questions about Mario, so if you could, please just cooperate with them. Do any of you guys have any information about anyone that might want to harm Mario? Do you know if he had problems with anybody? Did he owe anyone money? We're here to try to solve a murder, the murder of one of your classmates. Don't you want to try to help us find out who did this? [Kevin] Come on, kids. They both just here to help. Who was the last one in this class to talk to Mario? Come on, none of you? You're not helping us or Mario by being quiet. If you cooperate and you're scared, we can give you protection. Protection my ass. Y'all was not there to protect Mario. We're just here to try to get to the bottom of this, son. Mr. Hunter, let me give you my card. And if any of your students can remember anything, let me know as soon as possible. Okay, I will. Uh... Why don't we just head home for the day, kids? I think that's best. Can we... Let's meet up here at the school tomorrow and discuss how everybody's feeling. - [Burns] Okay. Thank you. - [Kevin] Come on, come on. [Hollister] Thank you. Sorry, kids. I can't believe this. Yeah, I'mma catch up with y'all, all right? - All right, man. - See you, Elijah. - [school bell ringing] - Slow down. Slow. Down. - [car honking] - Hey. [kid] Bye, Mr. Robinson. - Bye. - Bye.

I'm Casey, I'm a friend of your dad. He asked me to come get you 'cause he got into an accident to take you to see your grandmother. Accident? Oh, no, no, no. He'll be fine. Matter of fact, he's gonna meet us there as soon as possible. Let's go see your grandmother. Come on. It's about Mario. Okay. Um, is there something I should know about Mario that you didn't want to tell the detectives? I think I know what happened to him. What, Elijah? The other night, he went to see Trey about a job. Trey? A job? What kind of job? You know, a job. He was robbing houses and businesses. That's why he always had money in his pocket. And you think... What? he was so deep in it with Trey, and that's what got him killed? Man, Mr. Hunter, I don't know. There's a lot going through my mind right now. Hey, you gotta tell me everything you know. He was dealing with that crooked-ass cop. What crooked-ass cop? You know, the one that runs this program. What? W... Wait a minute, the music program? I thought Mrs. Clark ran this program? She do, but she's not the real boss. Elijah, who is this cop you're talking about? Detective Frank Mazzetti. Detective Frank Mazzett... Wait a minute. I know him. Yeah, well, he had Mario go out and do jobs for him too. He was getting him pills and shit. Elijah, why don't you head on home and, uh, we'll talk about this in the morning. And Elijah, let me worry about everything you just told me, aight? All right, Mr. Hunter. [tense music] Fucker! [paper rustling] [Gabriel] This is Gabriel Cavallero. If anything happens to me, Detective Frank Mazzetti did it. I found out he was embezzling the music program's grant money. Tell my uncle, Maxim Cavallero. You can find him at his warehouse on Industrial Boulevard, near the docks. [whispering] Oh, shit. [phone ringing] - [Carlos] Hello? - Hey, Carlos. [Carlos] What's up, Kev?

Well, he's inspired you to do some great things, and we want to thank you for giving us some great music. Ladies and gentlemen, the number one song in the country, Jennifer Jones.
