Oops. Dad! I'm outside, Emma! I thought we agreed to unpack the important stuff first? You know, the stuff we need to survive the harsh winter? Microwave, TV, toilet paper? Stop eye‐balling me, elf. Yay, Christmas! Uh, maybe we should just hang a wreath on the door? Ah, my sweet child. Potkins do not simply hang a wreath. It's go big or go home. I like the "go home" part. Come on, Em. This is a fresh start to our fresh start. New job. New 'hood. We gotta do this right. You should help. Get your Christmas on. You can untangle me! As amazing as that sounds, I'm missing a box. A crazy important one. It's labeled "crazy important"? Check my office. I left a bunch of unopened stuff in there. And I was serious, please untangle me? ♪ You'd better watch out ♪ ♪ You'd better not cry ♪ ♪ You'd better not pout ♪ ♪ I'm tellin' you why ♪ ♪ Santa Claus is comin' to town... ♪ Whoa, her house is phenomenal. ♪ He sees you when you're sleepin' ♪ ♪ He knows when you're awake ♪ ♪ He knows if you've been bad or good ♪ ♪ So be good for goodness sake ♪ ♪ You'd better watch out You'd better not cry... ♪ We're gonna need more lights. ♪ ...Tonight! ♪♪♪ Any luck? Uh, yup, all here. Christmas is officially saved. Well, good. Aw... the Potkins pajama photo. You know, your mother always picked those pajamas herself. Yeah, she had a real gift for hideous. She sure did. Look at that one. Adorbs. What was that, five years ago? Four. And no one says "adorbs". It's the last one we took. We should take this photo again. The two of us? Sorry, Dad, it's just not the same. Ah, come on, I can photoshop in Uncle Charlie and Grandma. Or the latest teen pop sensation whose name I'm not hip enough to know? Hey... It'll get easier, I promise. Eventually, this will start to feel like home. Not by tomorrow. Not by Christmas. We have shrinkage! This Christmas, I've incorporated the shrinkage/de‐shrinkage technology that allows us to fit a world worth of toys onto a single sled! All we need are these slick shades. Just because you're stuffing stockings doesn't mean you can't look snowman cool. Isn't that right, Commander Chill? Just give me the goggles, Elfonso. It's Christmas Eve. My squad's on the clock. Of course, the clock! Like all Elf‐Tech, these babies are powered by Christmas Magic. Which means they only work on Christmas Eve. Once the sun comes up on Christmas morning, everything shuts down. No shrinking, no unshrinking. Nada. Got it. Let's go. Wait! You need to know how to unshrink the toys. All right, talk fast, and no model poses. It's simple. This button, right here. Freeze ray! My bad. Uh, wrong button. Just need to reverse the process. Wowza! The dreaded orange mohawk! Oh, uh... I must have programmed the buttons wrong. Why do you always find the bugs during the demo? Elfonso! You're gonna have to come with us. Fix it in flight. Let's go‐‐ In flight? Have you flipped your pointy‐hat? I‐I'm not field trained, I'm a tech‐elf. You're the Chief Tech‐Elf! Nobody knows this stuff better than you. You can swap out with one of my elf commandos, okay? Come on. But I've never left the North Pole, or even seen a normal‐sized kid, or their hideous rounded ears. Get it together, elf! We need you on that sled. Christmas is depending on you. It's go time! Okay... They came! They actually came! Emma! Emma? What? Did the neighbor's lights start a fire? I know you miss the old house. And this Christmas seems a little lonely without the extended family. Father... what shady thing are you up to? No shade. Santa's work. A little Christmas surprise. Since we can't be there for the annual Potkins' shin‐dig, I decided to bring some family to us. Is it Grandma? Or Aunt Cicely? Oh, the Prizapelly twins! Please say the Prizapelly twins! No, uh... They're all too far away, so... I found our closest living relatives. There's a Monster Truck in our driveway. And it's bouncing. We've never actually met them, but we know them, by their reputation. No... You can't mean... the Farkleys? I'm sure they're not as bad as the urban legend suggests. So they didn't blow up Uncle Ted's station wagon on the Fourth of July? Or toilet paper the White House on Halloween? Or sink that cruise ship on Talk Like a Pirate Day? Those crazy Farkleys. Look, it'll be fun. Just don't turn your back on them, and hide the forks. Seasons greetings, Potkins! Barkley Farkley. Here's a fruitcake! Might want to re‐gift that. Merry Christmas, baby! Be good! Daddy and I love ya! Your parents, they're not staying? Nope. They're off to Peoria. There's a Monster Truck Rally on Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! But today is Friday! Friday! Friday! Which gives us plenty of family bonding time. Uh... I'm not sure what's happening. She's your cousin. Fourth Cousin, thrice removed. I can smell the resemblance. We should hang some stockings. On what? We don't even have a fireplace. Oh, don't we? It's not even moving. And... I got some fancy Christmas duct tape to put them up. Oh, no, you don't! Mom hand‐made this stocking for me. You don't just duct‐tape it to some television. We could superglue it. Well, since stockings are out, let's at least get ready for the annual Christmas PJ picture extravaganza! Ha ha! Whoa, freaky. I'm in! I'm out. So... you got any chestnuts? Uh... what is happening right now? I'm new to the whole Christmas Eve sleep‐over thing. Should we be doing something? Oh, a burping contest. No, no, no, that's not neces‐‐ Not Christmassy enough? I mean, I can do "Jingle Bells." Oh, no, no, no! Just sleep. You know sleep, right? Do that. Helps me sleep. Sorry, sir. Elfonso! Are you okay? Can you even talk? No permanent damage. Santa broke the fall. You're supposed to use the parachute. Kinda hard to pull the cord with my eyes closed and all the screaming. Just deliver your toys and meet back at the rendezvous point! It's go time! Commander Chill out! Who builds a house without a chimney? Gonna have to do this the hard way. Christmas is hard... Did you hear that? Barkley? My stocking! What are you doing? You know, just binge‐watching some fireplace TV. No spoilers. My stocking will not be hung from a Plasma Screen. I have standards! Oof! It's a‐‐ Lawn gnome. I knew they'd rise up and attack. The signs were there. ‐‐Elf! Aren't they supposed to be shorter, though? That's an awful stereotype. Piece of cake. Ah! Missed! Sweet Gingerbread! Not again! Okay, I'll just shrink you back to normal. You got this, Elfonso, you got this. Please work, please! Too small! Oh, it's stuck! What is happening! This is a disaster! Run! I can fix this. : We're alive! We're alive! Wait, what just happened? And why are there two giant Viking ships in your living room? Those aren't ships. They're shoes! Elf‐zilla! Kids! I saw kids! Curvy‐eared freaks. You're seeing things, Elfonso. It must be the hologram feature. Yeah. You saved my life. You did like my burping! No... No, this is not happening. Okay, not a hugger. I get it. I'll send you a thank you note. Or a pet snake. Please, no snake! It's all good. What is this place? Gift heaven. : Emma! Emma? Barkley Farkley? I thought I heard a noise. Hmm. No more eggnog before bed. Stupid elf! You never get caught! That's the first rule of elf club! Barkley? Barkley? I think I swallowed a doll head. Chill! Thank Gumdrops you called! I'm way out of my league here. This is worse than the Frosty Meltdown of '66. Elfonso, why aren't you wearing your goggles? Goggles... Oh, no! You need to find those goggles! Without them, you can't unshrink anything! : They must be in here somewhere. You're the one who warned us, once the sun comes up, Christmas magic goes away, and they won't even work anymore! Stop stressing me out! Oh no... Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no! I'll call you back. Where are those stupid goggles? Incoming! Stupid goggles! Okay, I went into my first house, I zapped the snowglobe, then that scary guy showed up, and... They must still be there! All right, Elfonso, time to put on your big‐boy stockings, and find those goggles. I just need a little elf‐confidence. Oh, no... Oh, no! I've lost my fourth cousin. Dad's going to kill me. My‐my stocking! Where's my stocking? Down here... Look down, beneath the toys. Getting warmer. Jackpot. You can talk? Is this like a Ghost of Christmas Past situation? Look inside! "To my favorite cuz, Love, Barkley." What's in the box? That was good! So good. Merry Christmas, cuz. We're walkie‐buds! Look down, by the bench! Aw, so cute. You look like a cricket. A cute, little, angry cricket. There's nothing cute about this! Or crickets. We're trapped! ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ I n a one‐horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go‐‐ ♪ Stop!

Your house is all the away on the other side of the street. And at our current shrunken size, we're a gazillion miles away. It would take a week to walk there. We don't have a week. We need the elf's goggles to unshrink us, tonight. Maybe we can find a stamp, mail ourselves. Barkley, this is serious! We're gonna be stuck like this! We'll be freaks! We'll have to check into a roach motel, and... and buy doll clothes! Have you seen doll clothes? They don't make cool doll clothes? It'll be all flower dresses and overalls! Okay, chill out, cuz. We've got till sun‐up. Which is in exactly three hours and 15 minutes. How do you know that? Doesn't everybody? Here, I'll set my stop‐watch. Let's see... Bingo! Nice. And... Do you have anything in that fanny pack that might actually help us? Like a plan, maybe? I have a plan. We hire ourselves out to salvage loose change from sofas. Or those keys that fall between the seats of cars. Anyway, we save up enough cash, then hire a mad scientist to build a machine that stretches our bones to full‐size. Boo‐yah! I knew you'd dig it, cuz. Locked. Uh... who are you? ♪ Elf‐A‐Gram! ♪ Man, talk about Christmas overload. Okay, Emma, it's up to you to find a way out of this mess. There! Barkley, are you seeing this? Barkley? Tell me you're not eating floor food. Of course not, that would be gross, and violate the 10‐second rule which I firmly abide by. We're in my neighbor's house, and we need to get her attention. Copy that. I could burrow under her toenail‐‐ No! Not what I'm saying. What's wrong with you? I meant, something a little less... blech. Okay. Copy that. Negative on the toenail. Going with plan B. I climb up, crawl inside her head, and kung fu an S.O.S. into her eardrum. Who exactly should I thank for sending me an "Elf‐A‐Gram" at 2:00 in the morning? Uh... secret admirer. Uh... need‐to‐know basis. Huh... I could've sworn we moved the couch into this room. Couch? I don't think so. What are you doing? Looking for rat infestations. It's part of your Elf‐A‐Gram signature service. Lucky you. I should go wake the kids. Kids? You mean with the high voices, and the diapers, and the messy rooms, and the creepy little ears and stuff? Sort of. They're real? Off the ground! Now! Come on! Let's go, off the ground. Move, move, move! Oh, no! What have I done? Oh, no. I can't look. Is it...? I'm afraid so. A little person. It's okay. We can glue its head back. Glue its head? What kind of sick monster are you? I've got others. I can spare one. Oh! It's just a Christmas Village figurine. Now, what are you doing still awake? Santa's coming, and I would hate for you to end up on the naughty list! Now, for the love of reindeer, don't step on the ground! You're gonna crush somebody! I'll just see myself out. I'll catch a cab back to the North Pole. Here I go, leaving now. Bye! Stupid gingerbread man... Yay, Christmas! Kids? Are you there? Kids! Are you sure we shouldn't just sleep here? I mean, these slippers look really comfortable. Just wake her up. But be gentle. Don't want her squashing you like a bug. Got it. I got just the thing in here somewhere. What's up with the whole fanny‐pack anyway? You must be talking about my utility belt. Why? You jelly? Uh, that's a definite "no". Oh, I get it. I'd be jealous of the best Christmas gift ever, too. Look... my parentals have to get a little creative with their gifts. Truth is, I'm usually flying solo on Christmas. I've had these walkies for five years now. Never had a friend to try them out with. Till now. Ba‐dang! Here it is. Uh... why do you have a tickling feather in your fanny‐pack? Where else would you keep your tickling feather? Gitchy‐gitchy‐goo! Ah‐gitchy‐gitchy‐goo! Definitely a Christmas to forget... Gitchy‐gitchy‐goo! Gitchy‐gitchy‐‐ Wait, Why do you get the cute, sparkly walkie‐talkie, and mine is all, "Ten‐hut!" Oh... I just thought that the camo one was more your vibe. You know, less girly‐girl. Since you're clearly going for the whole "I'm super serious" thing. Wait, what? Me? Uh... that is so not what I'm going for! Oh, well, either way, the bedazzles match my eyes. I think I need some radio‐silence. I should go off‐radio, too. These old lady dogs are pretty calloused. It's time to double‐feather. Goochy‐goochy‐goo! Come on, wake up. Ah‐gitchy‐gitchy‐goo! Ah‐gitchy‐gitchy‐goo! Uh... Barkley? We have a problem. A big, furry, whiskered problem. Did you hear me? Turn your walkie back on!

You're just making stupid sounds! Keep running! Yup! Couldn't agree more. Barkley, talk to me! Come out to the coast, have a few laughs. It's okay! Just stay where you are, you'll be safe. Safe? It's cardboard! Come on, kitty, stop it! This is only fun for one of us. I think I'm gonna barf. Barkley, stay in the tube. It's not safe. Wowzers! That is totally going in the new Christmas Tradition file. Barkley! Furball, 12:00! Hey there, kitty kitty. Look, I know you're angry. I'd be angry, too, if I had to wear that. Run, Emma! Get home!

Oh, come on, dead battery. Stupid bedazzled walkie! Tinselpaws... You know you're not supposed to be on the table. Help! Look down here! Play with your own toys. Oh, my word, it's the middle of the night. Timothy and the kids should have been here by now. Where's my phone? My phone... Grandma again. Must have fallen asleep. Um, you were supposed to be here hours ago. Everything is ready. I even have something extra special for little Timmy Jr. Please call me when you get this. What..? Yes! Tinselpaws... you understand. After all these years. I knew! We have to record this, for science! I'll get the camera. Cat people. Oh, no. The sleigh is on the move. It's my only chance for elf backup! Children, I'll be back. Remember, the microwave and the garbage disposal are not your friends. Just touch the letters that spell your name. Come on, you'll be famous. They'll put you on the interwebs. You can do it, yes, you can... Come on! Please, cuz, say something! Anything! Grunt! Scream! Yodel! You know what, I'm coming in there after you. You saved my fanny‐pack back there, the least I can do is‐‐ Oh... for the love of humanity, what is she feeding this cat? Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, cuz, I thought I was strong enough, but the smell... The smell. I didn't deserve you. You were the best fourth cousin I ever had. We didn't know each other for long, but the times we had? Good times. You're alive! And you smell like a cat toilet. Well, hold your nose. We've got a table to climb. See? The cat‐lady's phone is on the desk. We can call for help. Okay, well, we better hurry, because we have less than two hours left‐‐ Whoa... Candy! Sweet monster‐sized candy! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Barkley... stop acting like Barkley@ We're on a mission. Oh... Mayday! Mayday! Elf emergency alert! I can't find the sled. Does any elf copy? Elfonso! You missed the rendezvous point! We had to take off! Don't go! I have a situation. And we've got stockings to stuff! You're gonna have to fix it on your own, kiddo. On my own? I'm not trained for this! Whoa! Watch out for that plane! I'm not trained for anything... Huh, the grandkids. They do the whole pajama thing, too. I should've taken that picture. We will. I promise. Uh... what are you doing? Gotta stretch out the old number‐dialing legs. Barkley! Please stop making me roll my eyes. I'm getting a migraine. Okay, uh... Okay, you hit the "6" and "8", and I'll hit "Call". Okay. Who is this? It's the middle of the night! Uh... Dad! It's Emma! We need help! Whoever this is... ...don't call here again. Whoa! Okay then. Uh... we'll send a text. An S‐O‐S. You jump on "S", and I'll jump on "O". But I want to do "O". What? Watch it, Tiny Tim! This is fun! I like this game. Barkley! Watch your feet! It should not be this difficult! Total butt dial! This just got weird. Auto‐correct! You are the bane of my existence! Dad? Coming! Hey! Look down! ‐Timothy? ‐Can you see me? Are you on your way? You're still at the airport? I‐I didn't realize the storm was that bad. Well, it has to clear up soon. Everything's ready when you get here. Okay. Bye‐bye. It's okay, Tinselpaws. They know how much this visit means to us. We just have to wait a little while longer. I need some candy. And we need a new plan. Right, Barkley? Barkley, where are you? Mm... It's so good! Stop eating the calendar! I can't stop myself. It's so much yum. I've eaten my weight in sugar. My cavities have cavities. My blood runs thick with chocolate. Uh... Barkley, this is bad. Old lady's eating her feelings. You've gotta get out of there. No! I won't leave my sweet babies! We could stay in the calendar, and live the sweet life, the milk chocolatey life. I need some chocolate. She's coming. You have to get out of there. Barkley! She's gonna eat them all! You've got to get out of there! Don't worry! I mean, how much chocolate can she eat? Chocolate‐eating freak! This one's mine! Whoa! Not the dentures, not the dentures! Hey! Don't eat my cousin! Merry Christmas? I guess a good night's sleep is something I'm not getting for Christmas. The snow's really coming down. I bet it looks good against all the lights I put up. The girls should see this. Crazy cat lady! Come back! You're our only hope! Emma, look. Wow. It's snowing. On Christmas Eve. It's... ...beautiful. I mean, you can almost see the individual flakes. My dad did a good job with those lights. Clock's ticking. What are we gonna do? I've got the most epic idea. Kids! You gotta see this! It's like a winter wonderland. Kids? Yes, yes, an exterminator. Two of them! They were like tiny girls, only scary. Elves? They were around the presents. And one of them had a magic bag tied around its waist. My cat saw them, too. He might be able to describe them better. Hello? Hello? No, no, no, no, no... Kids? Kids! Kids! "Help"? You are here. Freeze! Easy... Is that tree loaded? Maybe. Who are you? Elfonso, the Elf... exterminator. I heard you had a little problem. A very, very little problem. Where did you see the elf infestation? The advent calendar. They were on my chocolate. Oh, no! Great Caesar's Snowballs! Are you in there, kids? Hang tight! I'll get some oatmeal and prune juice, and have you out in a few hours! I did not eat them. I don't think. My stomach has felt a little funny. Probably just nerves. Tonight has not turned out exactly as planned. Fear not! Elfonso, the great Elf, Gnome, and Leprechaun chaser is on the hunt. If they're here, I'll find them. They can't escape my expert eye. Look out! It's them! They're... flying? That copter was for my grandson! Thieves! Stop them! The remote. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! If you don't mind? Give it to me! No! Give it to me! Give it to me! Give me that! You can't! They'll crash! Elf ears... You're one of them! Christmas... still hard. Emma? Em? Emma? Where are you, Em? My snot has turned to snow boogers. Well, that plan went bust. You think? We're done. We'll never make it now. Don't worry, cuz. I got a plan. Two words, snowball... cannon. Please stop. Wait, is "snowball cannon" three words? Who cares? It's crazy! Like riding quad‐copters, or wearing fanny‐packs, or tickle‐feathers. The only reason we're here is 'cause you wanted to hang my stocking from a DVR'd Fireplace! I just wanted to help. Well, stop, 'cause your help isn't helpful. It's a disaster. It's no wonder you never had a walkie‐talkie buddy. You're right. I pushed too hard. I had to go full Barkley. It's just that my parents are always on the move, and I've never had a real Christmas, so I wanted this to be special. You know, with stockings hung by the chimney, and presents under the tree, and family and friends. I've never even had a real friend. But when I met you, I thought that maybe... It's stupid. No, it's not stupid. I'm just being a Grinch. I needed a friend, too. I never expected... this, exactly, but... it's growing on me. And not totally in a fungal way. I should've just hung my stocking from the stupid TV. It really is a great stocking. Mom made it. She rocked Christmas. Every year, she got my dad these insanely hideous sweaters. Itchy, disgusting ones. I got my dad one this year, for old times sake. It's so gross. It's under the tree right now. She loved Christmas so much. It hasn't the same without her. Maybe not the same. But it doesn't mean it can't be good. You're right. It's Christmas, anything's possible! Especially with a friend who's got your back. I feel a heartfelt hug coming on. And right back to full Barkley. Oh, you know you love it. Hey! You can hear us? Elf ears. Upside, super‐sensitive. Downside, impossible to find earmuffs, and headphones. The elf, he's talking to us. I'm really sorry about the whole shrink‐ray‐snafu. Totally my bad. I'm a tech guy. I usually work behind the scenes. I've never even been up this late on Christmas Eve. We are so doomed. But I am gonna Christmas‐up, and save the day. We are going to your house to find my unshrinking goggles. Ah! Easy with the grip there, fella! Blech! Sweaty‐hat‐head! Dude needs some serious conditioner. Yeah, but have you felt this elf skin? So smooth. Like a baby. Stop moving! What, are you Irish dancing in there? You're making me itch. Again, conditioner. What are you doing? How could you possibly have gotten here so fast? You're like a granny ninja! See, Tinselpaws? I'm not crazy! I caught the elf! Now, where is my grandson's toy? Toy? Um... Look! A flying reindeer! ‐Huh? ‐See ya! Stop! Kids! Run for the house! I'll distract her! We should do something. He's a big boy. Big enough to not be eaten by owls. Unlike us! There you are, toy thieves! She really is a granny ninja. Okay, uh... I thought you elves were supposed to give presents, not steal them. That copter was a special surprise for my grandson. I need it! Well, hopefully you got a gift receipt? Timmy! Are you near the house? I had to take care of a few tiny things. Closing the airport? For a little snow? But what about the food, the presents? A blizzard. I see. Well... maybe we'll see each other in the New Year. Or in the summer, when the kids are off school. Love you. Hug my grandbabies for me. Well, I guess I won't be needing that copter after all. She's gonna be all alone. On Christmas. Come on, cuz. We got a mountain to climb. Let's Christmas! Like a boss. So cold. I can't feel my eyeballs. We're so close. Nothing is gonna stand between us and that window. Yay Christmas! Sweet! Body‐sledding! Whee! Let's do that again! We cannot be related. Tell me again why we had to use the back window? I don't like the way that elf eyeballs me, okay? Point is, we're home. But not home free. Ten and a half minutes left! We need to find those goggles. They had flashing lights on them.. Look for those. This should help. How'd you do that? Atomic elbow‐dropped the power strip. Look. Yes. From down here, this village looks really creepy. This place is gonna give me nightmares. And I love nightmares. You're such a goof. You're her favorite aunt, I thought maybe she might be trying to head back home for Christmas. Yes, I've searched everywhere. I'll call you back. All right, all we've gotta do is climb up the base of the tree and crawl out onto one of the branches. Not me. For once. Emma? Barkley? Dad! Come on, we can't go back. It's now or never! It's just like a videogame. An extremely dangerous videogame, where your only get one precious, fragile life, and no savesies. That's your pep‐talk? Yeah, it could really use a little bit more pep. I'll work on it. For next time. As if there'll be a next time‐‐ Still not helping. You call it. Now! What are you doing? I thought there was gonna to be a countdown. Why? There's always a countdown! I can do this. Just going on instinct. No! I'm alive. I'm alive, and I don't know how! You're also going the wrong way! Open your eyes! Whoops! My bad. Ah, I can't watch. I'm stuck! Take your shoe off! Darn you, discount pleather. This is gonna leave a mark. Did I do that... with my mind? No, I did it. With my hand. I just realized this thing was a train switch Oh. Tiny‐peeps? Are you in there? Let me guess, another Elf‐o‐gram. Let's Christmas. Like a boss. The kids are in here. The kids? My kids? Where? What are we gonna do when we reach the goggles? I mean, our tiny fingers can't work the buttons. You're right. We need to signal my dad. But... how? It's them. They're in the tree! The goggles! I'm slipping. I think I can reach you. All you gotta do is grab my hand. But your stocking! It could be lost forever. Barkley... it's okay. Is there going to be a countdown‐‐ Now! Wow. I can't believe that worked. I've got a really crazy idea. The ugly Christmas sweater? I mean, this is crazy, even for me. I knew you'd dig it. It's been an honor Christmassing with you. Saved by the sweater. Aw, it itches so bad! Oh, scratch my face, scratch my face! Girls? How is this possible? Are you all right? Dad! 40 seconds! We need to hurry! Back up! Dawn is coming! I can't watch! Neither can I! The sun! It's Christmas morning, we're out of time! I feel taller. Hey, could you give me another zap? You know, give the old basketball career a little boost? No problem! Whoa! Stop while you're ahead. If anything had happened to the two of you‐‐ It's my fault. I'm sorry, Dad. I've been a total Emma‐neezer Scrooge. I shouldn't have made you move here. Dad, it's just... different. But different can be good. Different can be awesome. You know, there are actually gifts under here, too. You might need a magnifying glass and tweezers to open them. I could zap them. : No! Whoa. Okay then. I guess it's yell‐at‐the‐elf‐day. Wait. The sun is up. Why do the goggles still have power? Chill! I let you down. Christmas Eve is over. Not everywhere. Hawaii, for example. We still have a few hours on the clock. You invented this stuff. How do you not know that? I've never field‐tested, We're on the roof. Get up here! We've got a ton of toys to deliver to Maui. And you are piloting the sled. Me? For reals? Sled pilot? It was gonna be a surprise. For all the work you've done over the years. We all bought crash helmets. I'll be right there! Ah, we did it, boys. I love the holidays. Oh, hey, let's just, uh... keep this on the down‐low, okay? What happens on Christmas stays on Christmas.
