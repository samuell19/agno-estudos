** - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetheart. You getting ready for work? Yeah, trying to. Guess what I'm doing right now. Uh, talking to me? I am looking at a little thrush trying to get a sip of water out of a frozen pool. We had four inches of snow. It's no resort like the house you're sitting, honey, but it is beautiful here. Yeah, well, I went on a jog yesterday, and it was in the mid 80s, so... Well, that's not Christmassy. Well, we have Christmas in LA too, Mom. The other day there was a Salvation Army Santa outside the mall, and I gave him money. He had a beard and everything. Have you talked to your boss yet about Colorado? I told you. I have to wait for the right moment. She's a very busy lady, especially this time of year. I've never heard of-- Don't these people have families? Mom, I don't have time to talk to you about this, okay? I'll call you after work. Well, what do I tell your dad? Tell him I love him, and I'm putting my degree to good use. Well, you could put it to good use here too, you know. - Okay, Mom, look, I gotta go. - Bye, miss you. - Okay, I love you. Bye. - Bye. Good morning. Oh, God. - You're late. - I know. Thank you, thank you! - Ooh! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Did I get you? Nope. Disaster averted. Oh, thank you. - Cinnamon? - Oh, nutmeg. Oh, well, at least I had the right holiday. - Oh, you work here, right? - Yeah, in the building. Connolly Confections. I'm a copywriter. A copywriter, right. I should've guessed. Technically, I'm an executive assistant to the CEO, but I do a lot of writing for him. Very cool. Hey, listen, I've gotta go. I'm so sorry. I'm running late. My boss is gonna kill me-- So you work here too? Yeah. Bright Star Advertising. I'm also an executive assistant. But no writer, so... Well, I guess I'll see you around, huh? Yeah. Hey, you never told me your name. Jen. Jen. I'm Jon. Well, nice to meet you, Nutmeg Jon. I'll see you soon? I hope so. All right. I have been waiting 15 minutes for my latte. I'm so sorry, Kate. There was just an incident. And now it's already after nine. I'm sorry. Jen, when I had your position, do you know what Anita, my boss, used to tell me? Nine o'clock means 8:30 and... On time means you're late. Exactly. Hi, Boss. Hey, you used my tagline. Take a look at that. Yeah? You can't tell what's wrong with that? Looks good to me. That's why you will never be an ad man. Santa looks a little too... trim. We are not selling meal replacement shakes. Don't they know that? People want to see a plump Santa, not some malnourished, out-of-work actor in a dime store beard. So tell them. Make them reshoot it. I told them that before they shot it. And you know what Felix said to me? That we are taking a killing in the press by perpetuating the childhood obesity epidemic. That fat Santas only reinforce the idea that happiness is achieved by eating sugar and saturated fat. Don't forget, you have a 2:00 with the reps from Colson's. While you're doing that, I thought I'd work on your shareholder letter for the annual report. Hi, Mom. Sweetheart, hi. How are you? I'm fine. I just got home. What, did you go out to dinner? - No, from work. - It's almost 8:00. I know, Mom. We've had this conversation before. Nine to five days are a thing of the past. My goodness. You millennials with your crazy hours. All I ever hear about is work, work, work, work, work, work. You know, when I was your age-- Hey, Mom, what's up? I have like a million things to be doing. You know, your dad is very concerned because you haven't made your flight arrangements yet, honey. And the tickets, they just get more expensive every day. I told you, I'm doing the best I can. Uh-huh, it's just that you have never missed a holiday ski vacation, not even when you were in college. And we're very, very excited about meeting your new friend, even though your dad is not thrilled about the sleeping arrangements. I promise you'll like Peter. He's... He's charming. Uh-huh, well, honey, just make your arrangements, all right? Buy the tickets because it's just gonna get too expensive otherwise. Hey, Mom? I gotta go. I love you. Oh, okay, honey. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Okay, we can speak with Octane about their search engine optimization next week. I wanna give Jordyn enough time to digest the research. And, uh, the pea soup accessories pitch, well, let's move that to Friday afternoon. Oh, but that means that, uh, I'm gonna have to reschedule Stone Fruit. Hey, Kate, can I ask you a question? I know, I know, if we reschedule Stone Fruit, then the team won't have enough time to prepare the decks for Anderson, right? Oh, uh, no, actually. I meant something personal. Personal? Jen, we have a lot going on right now. I know, it's just, I was hoping that maybe I could have the week of Christmas off. - The whole week? - Yeah, it's just, my family does this holiday ski trip to Colorado and-- - And? - Since my brothers and sisters live across the country, and it's the only time of year I would get to see them... I'm sorry. It's out of the question. This is our busiest time of the season. Most of our clients have holiday campaigns, online deals, media buys. There's just no way. But I have the days saved up. Which I'll just bank for next year. Exactly. Now let's get back to more important matters. Tell Jordyn that research is gonna land on his desk top of the day. I was about to make a joke, but you don't exactly look like you're in a joking mood. It's that obvious, huh? The latte was just what I needed. Thank you. - May I? - Yeah, go ahead. Thanks. Come on. There's nothing that salty fried food can't fix. Thanks. So you gonna tell me what's wrong or should we play Twenty Questions? Just work. Well, it's not even the work part. The work part's fine. It's just my boss, Kate Hopkins, she's um, one of the executive vice presidents, and... Actually, do you mind? Those are really good. No, help yourself. I mean, I'm accessible to her all the time. Nights, weekends, you name it. And I do understand that it's a great opportunity for someone who wants to be an advertising executive, but that doesn't mean that she can control every aspect of my life, does it? No, you're right. And believe me, I can sympathize. Owen is just as demanding, probably even more. After all, he took his family's tiny candy store and turned it into an international conglomerate. But it's different for me. I don't wanna work in the industry forever. It's just a means to an end until I can finish my novel. I mean, I'm not being unreasonable, right? It's just a family tradition. And everybody gets Christmas off. Why can't I? I hear you. You deserve to get away. Then I think about the millions of college graduates who'd kill for an opportunity to work for Kate Hopkins. I mean, as a female executive, she was an inspiration to me. I guess I shouldn't make waves, huh? - Can I ask you a question? - Hm? Can I have a fry? Oh. Hey, Chet, how's it going? No, no, you're fine. Well, at the very least you can wait till the market opens. No, I hear ya. Just tell 'em to list on the Nikkei then. Hey, babe, do you have to do it right now? Hold on, hold on. Yeah, no, I hear ya, I do. Okay. I guess you're right, but if he burns us on this one, tell him he's gonna be calling widows from the boiler room for the rest of his career, huh? All right, no, no, no. Yeah, I'll talk to you later. All right, bye. - Do you have to do that? - Do what? Make a business call while we're at dinner. Money never sleeps, babe. That's even too cheesy for the movies, Peter. But it's true. If you wanna stay ahead, you always gotta stay on. You should know that better than anyone else. But I can take a half-hour for dinner. Good evening. Can I start you two off with a drink or a cocktail? Yeah, we'll have a bottle of the... Gran Moraine Pinot Noir. Very good. Actually, I'll have a margarita. Margarita? Hm. Yeah. Hey, um, listen, actually I need to talk to you about the ski trip. Don't worry. I promise I'll be on my best behavior. I told you your mother will be wrapped around my finger by the end of the week. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. - What do you mean? - Kate squashed that idea. She said she needs me at the office now more than ever. But I bought new bindings and just sharpened my skis, so... I'm sorry. I mean, maybe you can use them for next year? Um... No, I can still make this work. I think Dylan's going up to Vale. His parents have a place up there, so... Yeah, I think I might do that. I thought we can actually still have the holidays together. Jen, you don't expect me to stay here on vacation while you're working, do you? I don't work the entire time, and we would have Christmas together. Listen, sweetheart, I'm so happy that you're being so ambitious at work, I really am. But I had my heart set on skiing. I mean, you don't want me to miss out on that, do you? "Let us toast to animal pleasures, to escapism, to rain on the roof, and instant coffee. Meet me in the food court at noon." Jen, can you come in? I need you. All right. All right, I'm coming. Hey, I see you got my note. I'm honestly impressed. Quite the wordsmith. And a fan of Hunter S. Thompson. Oh, he wrote that. Yeah. And trust me, the second part of the quote, which I left out, is a lot more explicit. So what do you wanna talk to me about? Okay. Do you wanna get something to eat first? Oh, no, I have stuff in the kitchen. I don't have any fries today. Okay, so I've been thinking. What if there was a way to get our bosses to spend less time at the office? You're not thinking... murder? Jen, I'm serious. It would mean less time that we would have to spend at the office. I mean, that's great in theory, but I've literally seen Kate come to the office with a 104 fever and the flu. Owen is the exact same way. That's why this could work. What could work? Love. - Love? - Yeah. Or lust. Or passion. Or really even companionship. Whatever works. I don't think I'm following. We set them up. Owen and Kate. We get them together. We said it ourselves, although not in so many words, the two of them have so much in common. Yeah, Kate's single, but I don't think I've ever seen her go on a date. Honestly, I don't think she would even have the time. Exactly. That's why it's perfect. Owen isn't the dating type either. He's too focused on the company. But if there's anyone who can put up with a workaholic, who can understand what it's like, it's another workaholic. I don't know what to say. - Say yes. - No! I mean, no, it would never work. It's crazy. Why not? Well, for like a million reasons. Kate would never take my advice. I mean, it's not like we're girlfriends, and we just sit around and chitchat all day. No, no, no. We do this without them knowing. That's why it can work. We'll make it seem like they're getting together completely by chance. We pull the strings, but they have no idea we're involved. So you have some brilliant plan on how to pull this off? No. No? No, I haven't gotten that far yet. - You haven't? - No. I need your help for that. I can't do everything myself. Look, I really have to get back to work, okay? But you'll think about it? It's really not a bad idea, Jen. What's the worst that can happen? Nothing. The best-case scenario? The two of them fall madly in love, and we get our freedom back. I'll think about it. We can talk about it later. Just not here. And no more latte express. This has my cell and my email on it. I must be out of my mind. Hey, Peter. Hey, how are you? Yeah, I'm good. Yeah, I just got home from work. I was swamped, so I brought a lot of work home, so I'm probably just gonna work on that and then go to bed. Yeah, tomorrow sounds great. Okay. I'll see you then. All right, bye. What about a dating site? We could create fake profiles for them, using real information. After all, we know everything we need to know about 'em. Yeah, I don't think that would work. I could never convince her to sign up for a site like that. So you tell her you did it on her behalf. Found her the perfect guy. Trust me, she'd never give him a chance. She would think that finding someone on a dating site was beneath her. Yeah, I guess. There is a sort of desperation to those sites. What? Nothing. Nothing! Oh, my God, Jen, I'm so sorry. I really didn't-- You? Yeah, I mean, it's just kinda hard to meet people nowadays. Yeah, no, of course. I just didn't think someone like you would ever need to use one. Well, thank you, that's sweet. So, uh, you ever meet anyone on those sites that you actually liked? I'm actually still kinda dating someone I met. Really? I didn't, uh-- I'm sorry, I just didn't realize you were seeing someone. Yeah. Um, he works in finance. So, uh, you guys live together or something? No. Um... You know what? What about a raffle? - What do you mean? - You know, a raffle, where you put names in a hat or buy tickets or whatever and then you pick a winner. I could tell Kate that she won the Christmas annual building's raffle, and then you tell Owen that he won. But how do we rig it so that they both actually win? - There's not an actual raffle. - Oh. We just have to get them to meet. That's a terrible idea. Well, then do you have a better one? Unfortunately, no. Hm. Okay, raffle it is. - Cheers. - Cheers. I never entered any raffle. Everyone in the building had to. Automatically. They just took the information from our key cards and picked a winner. Sounds like an invasion of privacy to me. - What is this? - It's a raffle. Everyone who works in the building was entered. You won. All you have to do is go downstairs and claim the prize. - What's the prize? - I don't know. But it's something big, trust me. This isn't some stuffed animal at a carnival. Probably like a widescreen TV or something. I have so many TVs that I don't even watch. Well, it might be something even better. Jon, look, I don't have time for this nonsense. I'm too busy, Jen. Come on. It'll just take a few minutes. Why are you being so persistent about this? You'll donate it to charity then. It's a good look for the company. People will be happy to see you. Let them know you're part of the building community. I am not a part of the building community. If it's so important to you, then you go pick it up. I'm not going anywhere. Now, you can go pick it up for me, if that's what makes you happy. But I think they'll be disappointed when it's me and not you. See? So we know we can't entice them with free gifts, but what about something that benefits the company? They can't turn that down, right? Probably not. But what is that something? You know anything about podcasts? Not really. - But you know what they are. - Of course. My best friend in the entire world is Molly Lester. Does that name ring a bell? Okay, well, she has this really popular podcast where she interviews business leaders in the city. I mean, Kate listens to it. I'm sure Owen does too. Okay, so? So? She owes me a favor. I'm sure she would love to have them on her show. We could do some holiday special on how the holidays impact your business or something. - Why would Owen go for this? - Why wouldn't he? I mean, it's a great marketing opportunity, and he knows the value of good press. Plus, you could tailor the questions to make it seem like they have more in common than they actually do. And the best part is, if it goes badly, they can't trace it back to us because Molly's the one that sets it up. Plausible deniability. I like it. So what do you think? Well, it ain't a raffle, but I think it might work. I just love her show. She seems so nice. Kate Hopkins, such a pleasure. I'm Molly Lester. Pleasure's mine. I'm a big fan of your show. Please. My very rare talent is the unique ability to find people with actual talent. Oh. This is my executive assistant, Jen Russell. It's nice to meet you, Miss Lester. Come on, I'll introduce you to my other guest. - Sure. - Kate Hopkins, I'd like you to meet Owen Connolly, CEO of Connolly Confections. Ah, I've seen you around the building. I love your chocolates. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that... Bright Star Advertising. I'm an executive vice president there. Well, now that I know that, I'll be sure to send over some samples. Oh! Who can refuse a man bearing chocolates? Hi, I'm Jon, Owen's assistant. I'm Jen Russell. I am Kate's. - Nice to meet you. - Very nice to meet you. Okay, you two can watch through the glass, but I'm gonna need you outside the room. I don't know how much radio you two have done in the past, but this isn't much different, except one of the nice things is it isn't live, so if you make a mistake, misspeak, we have the luxury of editing it out. - Good. - Great. - Follow me. - Okay. So the holiday season must provide a unique opportunity for companies looking to advertise. There's definitely an increase in the number of clients that wanna be affiliated with the holidays. Yeah, it's always a challenge to keep up with the demands of the holidays and while staying fully conscious not to be dismissive - of the other 11 months. - Agreed. Has the decline of physical stores been an impediment? Listen, Connolly Confections has always been at the forefront of online shopping, even though candy is considered the ultimate impulse buy. Yeah. It must be unbelievably tough to convince people that they want chocolate. The right chocolate. That's a cut. I'm not just saying this. I have guests together all the time. I moderate panels. It's like the two of you rehearsed together. You were fantastic. I'm serious! You two should talk. Do business together. It's like you're on the same wavelength. I'm not sure if our little candy company can afford the big guns at Bright Star. Actually, our prices are competitive. Maybe we will. Like I said, there's gotta be tougher things to sell than chocolate. Well, again, thank you both for doing this. The episode will be uploaded next Monday. I'll send everyone emails promoting it, but I already know you're gonna love how it turns out. Thanks, Molly. You made this easy. You know, you guys did have good rapport. Molly was good. She knew the right questions to ask. No, not the host. Owen Connolly. What? Oh, he was fine. I guess. Wouldn't mind the business though. He was joking, but I do know how much they spend on digital each quarter. Plus, you two do have a lot in common, besides the fact that you work at the same building. Huh? Not to mention he's pretty easy on the eyes. You don't think so? Never crossed my mind at all. Mm-hmm. All I'm saying is you can't fake that kind of a connection. What connection? We were just having a business conversation. We were having a productive conversation about supply chains and product placement. Which she just happened to find ridiculously funny? She was just being polite. She was giggling at everything you said. And I might be wrong, but I don't think this is a woman who has giggled since grade school. Jon, I really don't have time for this. If you don't ask her out, then you're a complete idiot. You really think she was interested in me? I'm a writer. I have a sense about these things. Get me her number. Did you suggest Village Green Cafe? Uh-uh. He thought of it himself. Oh, well, he has pretty good taste. All right, then I suggested it. God, I haven't been there in forever. Anyways, Kate was kinda nervous tonight. It was kinda cute, but also kind of weird. I've just have never seen her like that. Usually when she presents to the board of directors, she makes them nervous. No way she'll back out, will she? Oh, no way. When Kate has her mind set on something, she does it. Besides, I think she was kinda looking forward to tonight. I hope Owen can handle himself. Since I've worked for him, I've never seen him go on a single date. And sometimes he can be kind of... boring, always talking about work. And you think Kate would rather talk about something else? Yeah, I guess. I'm just afraid that a million things could go wrong. Well, then they can blame poor Molly. Besides, a million things could go wrong with the date, but they already have a leg up. They've already seen each other, they have similar interests, and they have the most important thing on their side. What's that? Us. Listen, I gotta get going. I promised myself I'd finish another chapter before going to sleep. Oh, of your great American novel? Well, it's a novel. And American. Well, when are you gonna tell me what it's about? One day. Okay, fine. Good night, Jen. Good night, Jon. Miss me already? - What? - Mom? I don't even wanna know what that was about. No, I just, I just thought you were-- Oh, no, you thought I was Peter. It's okay. No! Oh, my God, no, I-- I didn't. Jen, we really need to talk about Colorado. I know that you don't think that your decision affects anybody else, but it does. I have to decide about the menu, I have to make the stockings, I have to figure out how many presents are under the tree. Mom, I know, okay? I know. Well, tell me you've at least talked to your boss. Yeah, I did. And? And I'm working on it, okay? Jen, I'm not trying to make you feel guilty. And you know I admire your work ethic. You know I do. Look at your father. He worked harder than anybody else. And do you ever remember him missing anything? A birthday or a recital or a Christmas ski vacation? No. I don't. No, because he never did. Because he had his priorities straight. Because family comes first before anything else. But, Mom, I'm trying, okay? It's not that I don't wanna be there. Honey, I just don't want you to wake up one morning and think, "Life has passed me by. I should've embraced it when I had the chance," you know? Mom, I'm gonna go to bed, okay? I love you. Sweet dreams, honey. Hey, Jen. How do I look? - Wonderful. - Don't patronize me. Never. I haven't been on an official date in forever. Well, it's just like riding a bike. Awkward and possibly embarrassing? See? Let him see that side of you tonight. Okay. I can do this. - Is he picking you up? - I'm gonna meet him there. That way if it's a disaster, I've got a way out. Well, at least you're optimistic. Oh, I have my phone on me, so if anything happens, call me. Go. Enjoy. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry. I just came straight from work. I didn't even get a chance to change. Oh, that's fine. Neither did I. You look great. Thank you. Have a seat. - So it's nice to see you again. - Likewise. I think we did a pretty good job on that interview, huh? Well, that was the general consensus, but I don't know. So how've you been? Get it. Excuse me? Your phone, get it. It's totally fine. - It's fine, it's totally fine. - Okay, okay, one second. I swear, just one second. Kate Hopkins. Yes. Yes, next Thursday will be fine. Yes, that will be fine. I'll talk with my in-house counsel tomorrow, and I'll hit you back, okay? I am so sorry. That was rude. So I've been thinking about this. - This? - Checking our phones. Why do we feel guilty about checking our phones? We both have companies to run, and we got people that we have to answer to. I know, right? Yeah, people making us out to like we have some twisted character flaw, like we're some kind of serial killers or something. Hm, they just don't understand. You know, my father founded this company. He wasn't the kind of guy to give advice, but he led more by example. But you know what my father said? He said, "It's never too soon to do something that you know is right." "It's never too soon to do something that you know is right." I like that. So I've been living my life by that motto. So why don't we do this date our way? Our way? I've been looking forward to seeing you, I've been looking forward to tonight, I've been looking forward to getting to know more about you. So you get a call, and I get an email that I have to return, does that change things? It doesn't. In fact, it's a relief. You know, so let's get some drinks, and let's talk about all the slackers in the world. Now that I can drink to. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you. - So far, so good, huh? - Yeah, from here. At least there's been no drinks thrown in anyone's face. You have a low bar for success, huh? Come on, they've got it from here. Mm. I don't see the two things being mutually exclusive. Really, I don't. There has to be a way to retain the high-end market, to make people see your chocolate as an indulgence, while still going after the market leaders. I know, but every time we talk to the consultants, I'm just-- No, no, no, no. Don't listen to the consultants. You pay them a ton of money to understand a business that you've been in your entire life. After a few months, how do you expect them to give you effective advice? Wow. You know, you're right. Of course, I'm right. What? Okay. Where have you been, you know? This is a really nice restaurant. I like it too. So maybe we should come back here and do it again. I'd like that a lot, Owen. Let's toast to that. Please. Jeez, you have a lot of books here. I do. Have you read them all? None. They just make me look smart. What's this? Hot chocolate with Chambord. Chambord? It's a raspberry liqueur. - Oh. - I know, I know. It sounds weird. But just try it. You'll like it. Okay. Hmm. Not too bad. See? I told you. God, I wish I had more time to read. You can always make more time for reading. Which one's your favorite? Oh! The Great Gatsby. I remember reading this in high school. Did you like it? Honestly, I don't remember. But it looks pretty valuable. For a first edition of a relatively modern novel, it is. - Hmm. - And the condition it's in, I could probably get two grand for it, easy. Really? But I could never sell it. It's sort of like a lucky charm. It sounds silly, I know, but whenever I'm stuck in my own novel or need some inspiration, I just take it down, read a few paragraphs, usually does the trick. It's that good, huh? It's not that it's so good, although I do like it. It's that when Gatsby was first published in 1925, it wasn't a hit. In fact, you could even say it was a flop. But now? It's considered one of the greatest novels of American literature. I don't know. I find it inspiring. Oh. Sorry. I didn't' realize what time it was. - I really need to go. - Yeah, no, of course. So I guess you could consider today a success, huh? Yeah. Yeah, I think so, for sure. You think she'll call you tonight? Oh, not a chance. I'll practically have to drag it out of her tomorrow. She's not really the forthcoming type. But don't worry. I'll get her to spill. Okay. So we talk tomorrow? Yeah, we'll talk tomorrow. I just, I don't understand. I mean, you said it was the perfect date. Why won't you go out with him again? I didn't say I wouldn't. It's just not the most important thing on my mind right now. Yeah, but it looked-- I mean, it sounded amazing. If I was you, I would-- Jen, you're not me. And I don't know how comfortable I am with you all up in my life. Now if I were you, I would be more focused on what we have going on here. Look, Kate, I know you're my boss. Believe me, I am reminded of that every single day. But believe it or not, I don't just admire you. I actually like you. So I thought it would be nice to see you happy for a change. Owen Connolly's office. We need to step it up. I'm sorry, who's this? I'm serious! If we leave it up to them, they're never going to get back together. Why? Owen said he had a great time. Yeah, but did he tell you when they're going to go out again? Uh, no. God, you're such a guy. It's because they didn't make a second date. Look, the two of them seem to clearly have a good time, and they both like each other, but they're both more concerned about how it's going to impact their work. I see what you mean. Okay, so what do we do? Like I said, we need to step it up. She said they went on a walk around the city. Who goes for a walk around the city? Got her out of the office and my hair, huh? That it did. I mean, come on, be honest. You're not even a little surprised? No. It was my idea, remember? I mean, I know, I know, but you honestly thought it'd be this successful? Okay, I admit I didn't anticipate they'd be going on a getaway together this soon. But it made sense. When the two of them decide to do something, they go all in. I know, but a whole weekend together? I mean, so many things can go wrong. Or go right. Have some faith, kid. I'll tell you, maybe I should give up this whole writing thing and start a matchmaking service. So far I'm batting a thousand. Yeah, and I could be your first client. Things aren't, uh, going well with your guy? No. I mean, yes. Things are fine. Sorry. I don't know why I said that. Look, I don't think it's fair that Kate and Owen get to have all the fun. What do you mean? We deserve a little celebration too. How about we do something while they're gone? - Do something. - Yeah. Go somewhere, do something. - Oh, Jon, I don't-- - Yeah, I know, I know. It was a stupid idea. I just got excited. I mean, it's not a stupid idea. It's just, I mean, I already have plans. It's kinda the reason we're doing this whole thing, right? It's okay, I get it. I need to get some writing done anyway. With all this planning and conspiring we've doing, I've been slacking off. You know, we should do this more often. - What's that? - This. Takeout and then a movie. Sometimes it beats going out. Mm. Hey, Peter? Huh? Who's your favorite author? Why? Just curious. I don't know. I don't really have one. Oh, come on. You have to have one. Um, I don't know. Daniel Lewis? Hm. I'm not familiar with his work. He wrote all the How to Be a Millionaire series. How to Be a Millionaire By 20. How to Be a Millionaire By 30. How to Be a Millionaire By 40. Duh. Oh. - Hey, babe? - Hmm? If How to Be a Millionaire by 20 had such good advice, then why do you have to buy the books in the series? Because... Look, Jen, I was thinking. Maybe we shouldn't get each other Christmas gifts for this season. You know, it's just that, I mean, we discussed that I'm going skiing and-- No, we didn't discuss it. You told me you were going. I wanted us to do Christmas here. Yeah, well, either way, I'm going skiing, so that's gonna be expensive, so I just thought-- You thought you didn't have to buy your girlfriend a gift? Because you need to buy, what, lift tickets and snow bunnies? Okay, well, let's not blow it up now 'cause I don't wanna argue about this, Jen, I really don't. But the truth is that most couples break up during the holiday season. It's true. I mean, you can look it up. I don't know if it's the pressure of the season, the financial burden or what, but... The truth is-- What, the truth is that you're breaking up with me? Is this how you're telling me that you don't wanna be with me anymore? Jen, we're both very busy people. Okay, that's just something you can't dispute. Oh, my God. Don't get me wrong. I've loved the times we've had together. I mean, we've had some great memories, but I think we owe it to ourselves to explore. Look, if you can't be a man and just give it to me straight, then I will. We're done. Okay, well, let's not blow it out of proportion. I mean, we can still see each other on occasion, you know. Oh, my God, I wasted a year. I wasted a whole year on you! What? You serious right now? Go, Peter! Please, just go. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? I got your voicemail. You really think I was gonna let that go? - Well, you could've called. - I did. Who doesn't take their phone when they go running? I don't. My best friend leaves me a message telling me she's not coming to my holiday party? Molly, I can't, okay? I just, I can't. Of course you can. If anyone needs to let loose a little, it's you. Yeah, well, will he be there? Come on, Jen. I've known Peter longer than I've known you. I can't just tell him not to come. Yeah, well, then I'm not coming. It's a party. You don't even have to talk to each other. I'll think about it. Okay? You know, I didn't really wanna have to bring this up, but it seems to me that somebody might owe me a favor. Oh, my God, get out! And next time, wait to be invited. Ehh. Not too bad. No distractions. Hey, Jon, it's Jen. I'm sorry. I know this is a little last minute, but my friend Molly? You remember Molly from the podcast. Yeah, she's having this holiday party tonight, and I was just gonna see if you might've want to possibly go with me? Um, yeah, so I know it's last minute, but, um, I'll probably head over there soon. Um, yeah, so I'll text you the details. Okay. Bye. Hey, Jon, it's Jen. Um, sorry. I know this is a little last minute, but my friend Molly? She's having this holiday party tonight, and I was just gonna see if you might've wanted to possibly go with me, um... You came! I did. Against my better judgment, but... We need to get you a drink. Get this woman a drink. - I'll take white wine, please. - Absolutely. I don't want you to freak out, but Peter is here. You warned me. And he brought someone. - What? - A date. Jeez, Molly, look, I can't do this right now. Look, I gotta make the rounds, say my hellos. I just wanted to let you know before you run into him-- them-- yourself. Look, just hang in there. It won't be so bad, okay? Okay. Well, hello, Jen. Petey, I wanna start drinking. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend, Petey? Jillian, this is, uh, my friend Jen. Right, just your long-lost friend. Let's not do this now, okay? Okay, come find me later? I'm gonna go get a drink. Okay. Well, she looks nice. I don't know what right you have to be angry with me. You're the one that broke us up. And you're just so devastated by it, aren't ya? What would you like me to do, Jen? Want me to go home and cry? Plus, I've known Jillian for quite some time now. Well, I'm not devastated either. Really? Mm-hm. Good for you. Okay. Was that your boyfriend? No, ex-boy... friend. You came. I would've been here sooner, but I didn't see your messages. I sort of sequestered myself. Sequestered? It's tough to do, but I put away my phone for a few hours. No outside contact. I just forced myself to write and write. And how'd it go? I think I'm having a better time here. Oh. Thank you. Perfect. Perfect. Hey, why don't we go somewhere quiet, where we can actually hear ourselves think? Yeah, sure. Do you wanna say bye to Molly first? No. She probably has some guy's tie wrapped around her head, singing "Santa Baby" by now. Let's go. I'd offer to hang your coat in the front hall closet, if I had a front hall closet. Or even a front hall. I'll just take it, if that's okay. Yeah, that's fine. Oh, needed a little inspiration, huh? Unfortunately, I think I'm needing it more and more nowadays. Oh, writer's block? Not block. Writer's doubt. Here, have a seat. Speaking of Gatsby, how 'bout a gin rickey? What's a gin rickey? It's what Daisy asked Tom Buchanan for. Oh, what's in it? Just gin, club soda, and lime juice. Ooh, that sounds delicious. It is. Even better, I actually have all the ingredients. Sometimes when I'm writing, it's literally like I have an out-of-body experience. I can't wait for the world to experience my novel. And other times, I'm absolutely convinced that it's the worst thing ever written. And when I'm being truly honest with myself, I'm afraid that the truth might be closer to the latter. And I'm not just being modest either. Sometimes I just don't know. And then there's times when I ask myself why I'm even doing it. Nobody cares about the great American novel anymore. They care about movies, about TV, about video games. It's almost as if I deliberately-- Rough night? Well, I spent it at Jon's. What? That's incredible. On the couch. Less incredible. We were just talking and having a good time, and the next thing you know, I fall asleep, so... So... nothing. Nope. He's a true gentleman. A true gentleman. Well, sometimes he can be too much of a gentleman. Yeah, but after Peter, it is a refreshing change. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. I mean, in some ways, we're so similar, but in others, it's just like he's nothing I've ever been with before. Uh-huh. I know I said it was a good thing. I mean, after Peter, with all his faults, he at least was stable. I mean, Jon wants to be a writer. A novelist. It's not the most practical of jobs. But it is romantic. God, I just keep talking in circles. I mean, some days we just talk about Kate and Owen all day, but I mean, even when he leaves, I still just wanna see him. Hello? Hey! I'm good. How are you? Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to. Okay, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. Need I ask? He asked me to lunch. From the way you're grinning ear-to-ear, I assume you're going. Well, a girl's gotta eat. Oh, my God, you did not. I did, I swear. There is no way that you thought the lyrics were, "The ants are my friends. They're blowin' in the wind." Don't pretend you can understand anything that Dylan says. Oh, my God, look at those! Okay, what am I looking at? These. Nice, I guess. Nice? They're gorgeous. And they're exactly Kate's style. Really? Okay, they're exactly my style, but I could never afford anything like this. You know what we should do? You should totally buy these for Owen to give to Kate. I mean, she would love them, huh? Come on. I'm afraid if we stay here any longer, you're gonna buy 'em for yourself. And considering the price, you'll probably be homeless. What is it? Nothing. It's just a silly family story. Come on, come on, tell me. Those earrings remind me of a pair of earrings my dad bought my mom when they were younger, and he couldn't afford them, so he actually sold his car so he could make the payments. And then my mom always wondered why he showed up to dates on a bicycle. Well, he sounds like a man who isn't afraid to take chances. - I admire that. - Speaking of chances, did you know that Owen and Kate are going out again? To one of their favorite places. I think it's become an almost every night occurrence. You think there's any danger in our plan working too well? Sure. It's forcing me to have to endure your company. Uh! It's beautiful. Yes, it is. We shouldn't. What do you mean? I'm not ready. But was it nice? Yeah. Yeah, it's too nice. That's the problem. Then I guess I don't understand. Jon, I just got out of a relationship. It ended pretty badly, if you don't recall. Just, I'm not ready to jump right back in. It wouldn't be fair to you. I can handle it. No, just... It doesn't feel right. It feels completely right. It felt that way from the very first time we met. You can't tell me you didn't feel it too. Yeah, but my feelings don't matter. Look, it's not responsible. Then what about my feelings? You're no fool, Jen. You're one of the smartest women I've ever met. You knew what you were doing to me. No. I thought we were friends. And what about the party? Is that how friends greet each other? Come on, Jon. You know why I did that. I explained-- I know, I know, it was just to make your ex jealous. But even then, it was special. We both felt it. I'm sorry. I'm not ready. So where does this leave us? As friends. I mean, we make a pretty good team. I don't know if I can do that. I don't know if I can go back to what we were. Well, you don't have a choice. Yeah. Yeah, I do. Jon. Jon! Jon! Ta-da! - For you. - For me? - Yes! - Okay, thanks. Ah, The Complete Works of John Keats. Well, I'm sure that you've read them all, obviously, but the bookstore owner said that that was a unique edition. Very cool. Thanks. What? Well, to be honest with you, I just assumed that you'd be a little bit more excited. Well, I am excited. It's a very nice gift. I said thanks. Yeah, but, all the notes that you sent me, quoting his work, I just assumed that was your favorite poet. Favorite poet? I don't have a favorite poet. You don't love poetry? Love poetry? I think the only poem that I can recite is the all the dancing, naked ladies in France, and the boys looking through the hole in the wall. What? Oh, my God. What? This is all the work of my assistant. I just don't understand, Jen. Why? Why? All that time and effort, and for what reason? Well, it started with the Colorado trip. When you didn't let me go, I was angry. I didn't think it was fair. So we thought that if the two of you found someone, someone you liked, you'd start spending time together. Giving you more of your own free time. Exactly. I mean, we never thought this would actually work so well. You two would actually be so perfect for each other. So why keep it a secret, hmm? For this very reason. We thought that if you found out, you might think that what you had wasn't real. But it wasn't real, Jon. It's what you thought it should be like, not what we did. It was completely selfish. It was selfish at first, I admit it, but then when I saw you two together, I just wanted to make it work. We both did. We? You have to believe me, Kate. Look, I know you're my boss, a tough boss, but I consider you a friend, a mentor, and I just wanted to see you happy. Now, what do you think Yeats would say would say about this? Keats. Yeats was a different poet, born almost 50 years after Keats' death. He would probably want to infuse a little confidence of human nature into your heart. What does that mean? I guess it means you need to have the courage not to squander a good thing. Hi, Mom. Hi, sweetheart. How are you? I'm fine. Well, you don't sound fine. Yeah, I'm probably just gonna go for a walk or something later. I don't know. Well, honey, I just was double-double checking that you can't make it to Colorado. You know, we really would love to have you. Mom, I want to go. I'm trying, okay? Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Actually, guess what. I saw some earrings the other day in this store that looked like the ones that Dad got you. You know, the ones that he sold his car for? You always did love that story. I haven't thought about those in a long time. What do you mean? Where are they? I think I misplaced them a while ago, when you were little. But what about the memories? Well, I'll always have the memories. I mean, I can't lose the memories. And best of all, I have your dad. I get to be with him every day, and I never needed anything to remind me how wonderful that is. Hey, Mom, look, I gotta go, okay? Okay, honey. Well, think about Colorado. Hey. Oh, I'm just fantastic. Yeah, my family's having a wonderful time on their holiday ski trip without me. Um, my boyfriend was so shattered by our breakup that he took all of about 30 seconds to grieve before he found someone else. My boss thinks I'm a liar. And, oh, yeah, the guy that I thought I could actually see myself with wants nothing to do with me, so yeah, how are you? Look, I appreciate it, Molly, but I'm just not feeling up to it. Yeah, tomorrow sounds great. Okay, I'll talk to you later. Come in. What, coming to tell me that you've stolen my identity and bought some expensive property off the coast? I need to talk to you. I quit. Look, Jon, I know I wasn't happy with what you did, even if your heart was in the right place-- That's not what this is about. Then what is it? I just can't do this anymore. It's not what I wanna do, and I'm getting too comfortable. If I wanna be a writer, if I really wanna see if I'm good enough, I can't be treating it as an afterthought. Jon, the holidays. You know what these next few weeks mean to us. - Our bottom line. - I know. And that's why I'll stay through January. You've always been good to me, Owen, I appreciate that. Jon, you're a really good assistant. Actually, much more than an assistant, really. You know, is there anything I can say to change your mind? You know, more responsibilities, more compensation? I appreciate it, but no. I've been thinking about it a lot. My mind's made up. Till January, huh? Yeah. Get back to work. So we finally got Stone Fruit to-- Owen? Don't blame your receptionist. I just walked right in and pretended I was supposed to be here. I was afraid you wouldn't wanna see me anymore. You remember my executive assistant Jen from the podcast. Ah, yes, the puppet mistress. - Mm-hmm. - Do you think you can talk some sense into your partner in crime? I'd hate to lose the best assistant I ever had. What do you mean? - He quit. - He quit? Yeah, he just walked into my office and said he couldn't do this anymore. Said he had to focus on his writing. I just figured it was another cockamamie scheme the two of you cooked up. I'm sorry. I need to go. Okay. - So? - So? So you selling chocolates door-to-door now? God, I missed you. I missed you too. I was thinking about something you said to me the other night about how none of this was real. You know, you were right. The chocolates and the gifts and the poetry. It was-- What was the word you used? Contrived. Right, contrived. But the way I felt about you, the way I felt when we were together, there was nothing contrived about that. I'm gonna need some time, Owen. Some time to think things through. Well, you take the time you need, but if you ever need anybody to take you to dinner or take you out to lunch, read you some incomprehensible poetry from 100 years ago, you know who to call. Thank you. Uh, you know, Keats died broke, right? Excuse me? Never mind. * It's that time of the year again * * We get around all our family and our friends * * We give thanks and good tidings and cheer * * It's that time of the year again * * And all I want for Christmas * * Is for you * To be here Well, this is a surprise. Your boss came by the office today. You quit? I told him I'd stay through the holidays. I don't want to leave him in the lurch. - Then what? - I don't really know. But what I do know is if I don't devote myself 100 % to the novel right now, I'll always be wondering. Wondering if I could've done it. And what's all this? Once I'm done, I figured... I figured I could use a change of scenery. And what about us? Us? Yeah. You made it perfectly clear what you thought about us. Jon, that's not fair. I just needed time. I had just ended things with Peter. I just needed a little time to sort things out. What we had, what I thought we had, you shouldn't have needed time to see that. I didn't. I'm so glad things are just so easy for you, Jon. But things aren't always just as black and white to me. I just had my world turned upside-down. And now? I don't know. Okay, I don't. I just, I know that when I heard you quit, I was worried. I was worried I would never see you again, and I thought maybe we should just give it another try. So I can get hurt again? Jon, I didn't mean to hurt you. Nobody ever means to. But I put my heart out there. I told you how I felt, and you... you didn't feel the same way. Well, it's not that simple. Look, I'm sorry you're hurting right now, I really am. But I'm not gonna let myself be hurt again. So what, this is your answer? Running away? A new start isn't running away. It's... starting over. Jon, look, I came here to apologize for the way I treated you. But the truth is, I think you're just scared. Scared? Yeah, scared. You always talk about taking risks with your writing, starting over like it's something brave. I think you're just frightened to see what's right in front of your face. I knew what was right in front of my face, and it broke my heart. "A lot of you out there tonight, guests, new friends, might think all we do is make chocolate. A mixture of cocoa beans, sugar, and milk. Well, I never believed that. I always believed that we were doing something much more than that. We were making memories." That's laying on a little thick, don't you think? I mean, it's a holiday party, It's not a shareholders' meeting. I thought you said you wanted something heartfelt this year. I do, but it sounds like your heart, not mine. Fine. How about... Connolly Confections is a lot more than a candy company. Wherever you are, it's a taste of home. A taste of home. I like that. Do you still wanna mention what great gifts they make? Of course. It's a holiday party. Every holiday party is a PR event. Gotta remind 'em. Speaking of gifts, you know that jewelry store right down the street? Schaeffer's, I think? Yeah, I think so. Well, in the display window, almost right in the middle, is this pair of diamond earrings. - They look like teardrops. - Okay. Well, Jen once mentioned to me that Kate would love them. She loved them, too, but they were a little out of her price range. I'm not really sure where Kate and I stand right now. Well, I'm just saying, if you wanna make an impression on her... Yeah, well, I'll take that under consideration. Now let's get back to writing this speech! Work, work! All right. So Owen invited me to their big Christmas party as his date. - Oh, really? - You were right. Not about what you did. You were still stupid about that, but about what you said. It really doesn't matter how we got together. What matters is how I feel when I'm with him. And it feels right. Well, I'm glad, and I really am glad you're going to the party. Jen, I want you to come with me. Oh, no, I-I don't think I'm ready. Look, I may have made a mistake about not letting you go to Colorado. I don't wanna completely ruin your Christmas. I don't know. What if-- What if Jon is there and-- Then I'm making it mandatory. Well, I guess I don't have a choice. Good. God, I can't believe she talked me into going. Relax. You'll have a great time. What if I see him there? Of course you'll see him there. You told me he's going. Okay, well, what do I say? Hello, for starters. Okay. How do I look? What? - What, not good? - No, no. You look great, but... You don't think that's too much? When you do run into Jon, this is what you wanna be wearing. * Ah, ooh - Oh! - Champagne? - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Now aren't you glad that I forced you to come? Do you see Jon? Come on, Jen. Forget about him. Have some fun. You deserve it. * Oh * Gloria Good evening. Can I get everyone's attention? Wanna thank you all for coming. And just in case we couldn't entice you with our chocolate, we have an open bar all night. I know many of you may think of Connolly Confections as just a chocolate company, but we are so much more than that. * Wherever you go * I wanna be there * Sharing these holidays * Now it feels like a hole * Is here in my heart * 'Cause I'm watching you walk away * * Though carolers are singing * And the snow's falling down * * It doesn't feel like Christmas * * Without you here * It doesn't feel like Christmas * * 'Cause you're so far away * Hey, man, sorry, we're closed. Try coming back at 10 a.m. Please, just give me a couple minutes. Wow. This is in extraordinary condition. Thank you. I made sure to take good care of it. 500 bucks. Come on, mister. We both know how much this is worth. $1,500, not a penny more. Two grand, or I walk away right now. And you don't know when another first edition like this is gonna come through your door. What the heck? It's Christmas. Good afternoon. May I help you? Right there. There used to be a pair of earrings. They looked like teardrops. They were there for weeks. Ah, yes. Beautiful, weren't they? Where are they now? Sold, I'm afraid. This morning, actually. I should go over there and be with him. You gonna be okay? Yes, go. I'll be fine. So how was my speech? It was wonderful. Well, it wasn't Keats. It was better than Keats. It was yours. Jon wrote most of it, but, um, it was my sentiments. - I was wrong, Owen. - About what? About saying that this wasn't real. This has been more real than anything that I've ever had in my life. I was a fool. A fool to think that it mattered how we got together. And to be honest, no one has ever made me feel like this before. Ever. What's this? My heart. One second. - Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh! - Are you okay? I am better than okay. You won't believe it. What? Tell me, what is it? Owen asked me to marry him. I said yes. Oh, my God. I'm so excited for you. He said it was too soon, and I know that it's too soon. But he said that he's never felt like this before. He knows that I'm the one. It's crazy, but-- This is the smartest decision you've ever made. It's all because of you. You know that, right? I gotta tell somebody. I gotta tell some people! Go! Go! I'm engaged! Oh! What happened? I thought you weren't coming. Yeah, well, I had a change of heart. I was hoping you would. I got something for you. How'd the speech go? Perfect. It was a hit. What is this? Let's just call it your severance. I-I don't understand. Give them to her. She deserves them. You deserve them. What about Kate? Trust me. I think Kate will be just fine. What can I get you, miss? I'm actually good. Thank you. Happy holidays. I've been a fool. Jon, you don't have to explain-- No, please, let me finish. You were right. I was scared. Everything I wanted was right in front of me. But I was afraid. I was afraid you wouldn't feel the same way. So I made excuses. Excuses about how I wanted to do other things, focus on my writing. But then I realized if I wanna take a risk, I want it to be on the one thing that's most important to me. And that's you. So you're staying? I'm staying. And if I have my way, I'm not leaving you ever again. Here. I have something for you. Oh, my God. It's the earrings. From the first time we saw them, I knew you were meant to have them. Jon, they're beautiful. They don't have a thing on you. You know people are gonna say we're crazy, right? I mean, we really just met. That's true, but a smart man once said to me that it's never too soon to do what you know is right. Oh, he must've been a really smart man. This feels so right. Yeah, it does. So... doesn't this feel better than Colorado? Oh. I decided I'm going to Colorado. - Oh! - We're going. Right. We're going. Well, it's not like I have any say anymore. Uh, yeah, about that. What would you think if I told you I wanted to come back? How could I say no to the best assistant I've ever had? Because I'd be coming back as a writer. Oh! Speeches, PR releases, catalog copy. Whatever needs writing. But that'll be my full-time job. Well, after all the two of you have done for us, it's the least I can do. We owe you both. Don't think we don't know that. Oh, don't worry. We'll remind you frequently. Plus, something even better came out of your relationship. What's that? Ours. - Ours too. - Yes. ** - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Who should I make it out to, ma'am? I have something for you. I don't understand. Open it, or you're gonna have some impatient fans. It broke my heart that you had to get rid of it, so I wanted you to have it forever. Just like you. **
