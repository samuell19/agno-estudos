The story of Joseph and his dreams teaches us about the importance of patience, perseverance, and faith in god. Despite facing many challenges and setbacks, Jospeh never lost hope. And he ultimately achieved great success, and fulfilment. Trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on... Hey. Charlie Hayes live here? Know where he lives? If we want to overcome... We need to be creative in our dreams. Every negative has a positive. As overcomers... - Charlie Hayes, know him? - Yeah. - Know where he lives? - Yeah. Hello. Charlie? Charlie Hayes? Who are you? Copper. Travis Hurley. What kind of name is that? The kind I was given. How'd you find me? Just asked the cops. Seems they know a lot about you. You here about my warrants? Not here for you? - Here about your sister. - Yeah which one? Charlotte. They find something? Just here to review the case. Review, what does that mean? Means take another look at things with fresh eyes. Get the family's view on how the case was handled. Any new evidence could reopen the case. I wouldn't get your hopes up. We needed fresh eyes twenty fucking years ago. Not now. Besides, I don't talk to cops. Especially not White ones. Get the fuck out of here. Fair enough. You know where I can find your sister, Emma? She works at the cafe in the main street. I'm only in town for a few days. So uh... Don't take too long... if you do want to change your mind. Emma? Yeah? My name's Travis. Is this about my brother? No. I'm reviewing Charlotte's case. Emma. What do you want? Just want to talk that's all. About what? About Charlotte, about you, the case. Have you spoken to my brother? Yeah just met Charlie. And what did he say? He told me to fuck off. I'll have a think about it. I'm going to get out of here as soon as I can so... don't take too long. Let me know if you do want to talk. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. The righteous cry out, and the lord hears them. Hello. Leon. Leon. You Leon? You know where he is? Leon? He's over there. I did my best... digging the grave I mean. When did he die? Must have been last year some time. I don't remember exactly. What happened? Found him in his chair one morning. Dementia just wasted him away. Had Dementia? Lost everything in the end. Didn't know who I was. Even forgot his own name. Who are you? I'm his brother. Joseph people call me... or used to. I don't see many these days... people that is. You live here Joseph? Now I'm mostly here... looking after Leon's old dog. Making sure the Dingos don't eat him. They built that fence to keep them out. But lately they've been finding ways to get around it. I didn't catch your name by the way. Travis. Policeman is you? How'd you know? Well I didn't. I was just wanting to talk to Leon but I guess that ain't going to happen now. No... sure ain't. Anything I can help you with? I don't know it's about a missing girl case from twenty odd years ago. Name was Charlotte Hayes. I don't know if you remember anything? Yeah... I remember. You know they cleared him of that business a long time ago. I know. I just been sent out here to take another look at it. Well... you're welcome to have a look around... seeing as you came all the way out here. Nar, I reckon I seen about enough. Thanks for your time. And we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him. Who have been called according to his purpose. Joseph was known for having dreams that predicted his future... as well as the the future of his family. Joseph never lost hope and he ultimately achieved great success and fulfilment. It is important to remember that not all dreams are necessarily from god. Fuck this. Computer chip's fried. She ain't going anywhere. Fuck. Did you call the cops? No point. Yeah. Wouldn't have done you any good. Kids around here... are running fucking wild. Cops can't keep up. They lock them up. The next day they're out there doing the same fucking thing. How long is it going to take to fix? We have to get a new chip from the city. A few days at least, if they got any fucking stock. Stock's the problem. Nobody's got any fucking stock. Any of these old things run? They're all fucked. Except that one. She runs. I could clean her up for you. Rent her out to you. What happened to your rig? Engine trouble. Engine trouble. Yeah. That's what I said. Engine trouble. Why'd you call me, Charlie? Listen, I don't want to be here... you don't want to talk so why don't I just fuck off. How about we go for a drive? The spot back there. What spot? Where she was taken. This is it. Local fulla was driving in that direction. Told the cops he saw Charlotte walking along here just around sunset. Said she was carrying a loaf of bread, bottle of milk. Where was she going? She was on her way back home from the servo. Who was the witness? Just a local fulla, he died years ago now. And where were you, when Charlotte disappeared? Why does that matter? I was at a cousin's house. Who reported her missing? Later that night mum called the cop station, told them Charlotte was missing. The cop was at home. Wouldn't meet mum at the station 'til the morning. Just kept telling her, she'll turn up. And two weeks later... cops decided to get off their arse. Not to look for Charlotte but, they started investigating all the black fullas in town... bought child welfare out here. Us three kids we all got different fathers. So they tried to blame mum, say she was a bad mother. That's when they came after me. They didn't go after Leon til a year later. It was too late, they didn't have enough on him. The cops didn't move quick enough. Who puts these flowers here? Don't know. People been putting them here for years. We had a memorial there on the ground... but it kept being destroyed. Usually they'll tell you to move along, drinking on the street like this, not today. Must be because of you. You know Leon died? When? Sometime last year. Went out to see his brother Joseph yesterday. Saw Leon's grave. That grave might be empty though. He could have just run away, wouldn't put it past him. Joseph said he had dementia... lost his memory. Lucky him. Wouldn't mind losing mine. They won't reopen it now will they? Depends on what we find. What do you want? Just a coffee... white. White enough for you? I don't want to talk. Got nothing to say. How about this one? Not enough colour Bub. I like it, I'm keeping it. I'm tired. I want to go home. How come Zac doesn't have to help? Don't worry about Zac. Just do your job. But there's nothing left here except for garbage. If we give up now we'll have no chance will we. Hurry up before the sun goes down. Look, all I can give you is sixty for it. Sixty bucks? You've got to be fucking kidding me? It's being generous, very generous. Give them back girls. We didn't come here for your lollies. Give it back. Jessie. Ava. Zac, open the door. Open the door now or you can find somewhere else to live. School said you didn't rock up last week... is that right? Better get your arse to school tomorrow... or don't bother coming home. This is Detective Ray Summers. The time is 10:05, May 10 2003. Please state your name and age. Leon Cutmore, 48 years old. You right for a cigarette? Yeah... I roll my own. Where do you live? I got a mine out on Dingo Fence Road. How long you been there? Just on ten years. Who do you live with out there? It's just me most of the time. Do you know a local girl by the name of Charlotte Hayes? No, I don't know her. Have you ever seen her? No, wouldn't know what she looks like. I heard about the thing on the news though. What did you hear? That she was missing. The day was Sunday, May 5... Do you remember what you did that day? I got no idea, too long ago. But Sundays I go to church. Do you go to church often? When I feel the need. Well we heard you had lots of visitors out there. Had some local black fellas complaining about you. They said you had young black girls out there... giving them alcohol and dope, that true? I just had a few parties out there, if that's what you're talking about. What went on at these parties? People just let their hair down, enjoyed themselves. Did you supply alcohol to minors? I actually don't remember... too long ago. Did you own a green Ford? A Ford Laser? Yeah. Did you own a green Ford? A Ford Laser? Yeah. You still have it? Had a problem with the... the whole car was fucked. Was a bit of a shitbox. Did something happen in that car? Leon? Leon? You got something to tell us Leon? Yeah. You're wasting your time. We welcome everyone to Limbo. Our doors are open to all. The real Limbo refers to an edge or boundary. Referring to the edge of hell. The Limbo of the Patriarchs... is seen as the temporary state of those who... despite the sins they may have committed... died in the friendship of God... but could not enter heaven... until redemption by Jesus Christ... made it possible. Christ revealed to us that he will come... and in his second coming... to judge the living and the dead. A judgement in which he will separate human beings... as a shepherd separates sheep from the goats. You will see that around Christ... are those who are in paradise. They are in a golden light. The light surrounding them is golden. This same golden light... as it gets further away from Christ... begins to change colour... and gradually... the further away it goes... it turns from gold to red... and in the red light... are the damned. We welcome everyone to Limbo. Our doors are open to all. The real Limbo... refers to an edge or boundary... referring to the edge of hell. Yeah. It's me... Charlie. You busy? No, not busy. I um... got something to say. Yeah, well say it. Not on the phone. You don't like black fullas do you? I guess I don't like anyone too much. Most people don't think too much of me either. I've had a few run-ins with black fullas. They weren't too pleasant. For who? Maybe both. The White fullas, they say we should get over it. Let bygones be bygones. Twenty years is a long time, but it feels like yesterday. It's not a long time for us. We see when White kids get taken. Police take it serious. It's on the news, it's on the radio... bring out the dogs, fucking choppers. They just thought our sister went walkabout, they didn't care. Nobody cares you know. Nobody's ever cared. People like you fucking come and go. Nothing ever changes. What do you know about these parties out at Leon's place. Lots of kids used to go out there. Get some free yarndi and grog. You ever go? Couple of times. What went on? People just had a good time. It's all they want... to feel happy. You know if Leon ever had contact with Charlotte? I don't think so. But everyone knew he liked young black girls. I'll tell you a secret. About a month after Charlotte disappeared... Leon was drinking at the pub one night. He was drinking with a blackfulla called Stoney. And he told Stoney he killed someone. Stoney never went to the cops about it. Why you telling me this? Why are you asking me that? You got time to kill don't you? Where's this bloke Stoney now? Should be around. Just wait here. Uncle. Uncle, tell this fulla what you know. He don't want to talk to me? It's alright Uncle you can tell him. Said he was drinking with Leon at the pub, it was a long time ago now. And Leon said he killed someone. Why didn't he tell the Police? Well he already had a warrant out for him. They would have arrested him on the spot. For what? Just unpaid fines, being drunk on the street. He say what he did with the body? Give me that. He said it was out at Four Mile Creek. You know where that is? It's an old mining place just west of town. Leon tell him who the person was? No, but he thought it could have been Charlotte. Could have been anyone though. Thank you. Must be a hundred holes here. Half are filled in. What was this place? Used to be an old blackfulla's camp. They used to noodle around through the White man's scraps. Get everything that was left behind. Swap the opals for flour, tea, sugar. You believe what Stoney said? Yeah. Just don't know about Leon. People will say all kinds of things, especially when they're drunk. Why'd the coppers come after you so hard? - You think I took Charlotte? - No. I got set up. By who? Two local lads. They were the cop's first suspects before me. They just tried to save themselves by throwing me in the fire. Why were they suspects? Who knows, because they were black with a record. They still around? One of them's still alive. His name's Oscar Porter. Will he talk? Depends. On what? Whether he'll trust a White fulla copper. He works in town there at the wreckers. Just ask for Oscar, they all know him down there. I'd take you myself but... a few years ago I punched his lights out. Mum. This dog came in the yard, can we keep it? What's going on? Fair enough. You got my message. Any luck? Not yet. Beautiful kids. You got any? Kids, yeah. I got a son, kind of. What's kind of mean? It's a bit of a story. Who we got here? This is Jessie. Hey Jessie. Who are you? This is Uncle Travis. He come to say hello. You know those smokes will kill you? Yeah, I know. Where you from? I come from... up there. You mean you're a space man? Where's your spaceship? Over there. That old thing, more like space junk. How old are you? Old enough. You're a cheeky little thing aren't you. You busy? I want to show you something. This is it. They replaced the pole with a new one. It split Mum's car in half. I was always worried she was going to hurt herself. She carried a lot of blame. She said the hardest part was not being able to bury her daughter. And have the truth come out. Charlie... he just lost it. Pretty much been on my own since then... with his kids. And Zac... he was five when I got him. And now he's starting to get into trouble. Hasn't seen his dad for years. Do you know Leon Cutmore died last year? Had no idea. Did you ever have any contact with him before Charlotte disappeared? Why? It's a small town. Did you ever go to any of those parties out there? You think he took Charlotte? I don't know. People talk. That's Charlie. He always pulls up and stops but... he never gets out. So what can't you eat? Why? I was going to invite you to dinner Friday night... if you're not doing anything. Maybe not a good idea. Why? Well, you're invited. If you're not there by six, we'll start without you. It's you. What happened to your car? Those wild kids didn't steal it on you did they? Nar, just some engine trouble. Engine trouble. Well that's new cars for you. Yeah I guess. Turns out I got to wait around for a few days. A few days? Yeah, looks like it. Well what are you going to do? Not too sure. Well... suppose you better come in for a cuppa. You ever get much opal out of here? Just enough to get by... nothing too exciting. Always been a miner? I used to work in the hospital in town. Oh yeah. What did you do up there? I was a handy man. Whatever needed fixing, I fixed it. Why didn't Leon ever move away from here? Well he thought about it... plenty of times. We both did. We weren't going to run away from something we didn't do. Besides... I had nowhere else to go. What was it like back then, when they charged him? You know what small towns are like. People talk... people say things. Before you know it, everyone's believing it like it was the Bible. What kind of car did Leon drive back then? I think it was a little Ford. A Ford Laser. What happened to it? He sold it. When? A long time ago. You remember who he sold it to? Someone in the city... I don't remember. Yeah I don't blame you... a long time ago. Too long. I wish I could help that family find some peace, I really do. Sometimes you can just... never find the truth. Have to find another way to make peace. It's all a big mess you know. Nobody knows who they are anymore. Now we're all living with it. Listen. You hear that? They're getting closer. I don't feel well. I'm going to have to lie down. - You need help? - Nar I can manage. Interview two with Charlie Hayes... stepbrother of Charlotte Hayes. Conducted by Detective Ray Summers... Limbo Police station, July 9, 2002. Okay Charlie... just want you to know you can leave anytime. Okay. What kind of person would murder a little girl? A sick person, that's what I think. But I don't know. We just want to know what happened. Just want Charlotte to come home. We checked out your alibi. Your cousins said you were with them. I'll tell you now, that alibi won't hold up in court. All your cousins are convicted criminals... just like you. Did you have anything to do with this Charlie? No. Had nothing to do with it. - But you did. - No. But we know you did. We got two witnesses, who said you did it. What witnesses? Two local boys. Well they're fucking lying. She was a pretty girl, hey Charlie. You tried to have sex with Charlotte. And she fought back. You hit her... and you killed her. You didn't mean to, but that's what happend didn't it Charlie. You know that big old Gum tree we got out the back? You now what that's for? Stringing up lying black fullas... just like you. Let me out of here. What'd you say Charlie? What'd you say? I said let me out of here. Come on buddy, just let it go. You can stop all that pressure right now. Said let me the fuck out. Oscar about? What the fuck's he done? Nothing, just want a word. That white ute. Oscar. Oscar. Travis. Thanks for coming. No worries. So this the spot? About twenty years ago now. Cops came and got me and my cousin Kenny off the streets. Drove us up to this spot here. What happened? Dragged us to the tower over there. Handcuffed us. Tried to get us to confess to Charlotte's murder. Dragged us real rough across the stones too. I was only a skinny fulla back then. Easy to push around. They said we'd go to hell too if we don't admit to anything. They touch you? See that there? They touched us alright. You ever tell anyone about this? Just family. What'd you end up telling the cops? We ended up making up a story saying that Charlie admitted to it. They wouldn't leave us alone unless they got something from us man. And your cousin Kenny... what happened to him? They was a lot harder on Kenny. A lot of bad stuff happened from this business. Young fullas killing themselves... kids getting more and more in trouble. Kenny ended up in jail for other stuff... ended up dying in there couple of years ago. You reckon Leon Cutmore killed Charlotte? Everyone knew he liked young black girls hey. There was one morning me and my girlfriend woke up in his caravan after a party. Was hard to wake up. We reckon he spiked our drinks. If it wasn't him, we don't know who else could have done it. You going to find out what happened to Charlotte? That's not my job mate. Emma? Yeah? Who are you? I just wanted to say... I'm really sorry... for what happened to your family. What are you talking about? Who are you? Girls, get in the car now. Who was that? Nobody, get in the car. You made it. Yeah, I made it. Better come in then. So how is it? Yeah... better than the hotel. Are you Mummy's new boyfriend? Jessie. That's a very rude thing to say. No, it's okay. No it's not. Eat your dinner. It's just that... Mum's had lots of boyfriends. Jessie, that's enough. Emma said you're a cop. Are you really a cop? Yeah. Well you don't look like a cop. What do I look like? A drug dealer. Ava. Eat your tea. Well I would never want to be a cop. Why's that? Because they let someone take my Aunt Charlotte away. And they locked up my Uncle... her father. That's a shame. Yeah, a big shame. Why'd you become a cop? I guess I like catching bad guys. Well there's plenty of bad guys around here. Really? Yeah, they're everywhere. That's what Aunt Emma says. Alright. That's enough. Come on lets go brush your teeth. No. Jessie, move. But we're still eating. You've had enough to eat. Come on let's go. Okay... time for bed you two. I want to say goodnight to Uncle Travis. Me too. Uncle Travis. You're wanted. Ava wants to say something to you. - Goodnight Uncle Travis. - Goodnight Uncle Travis. Goodnight. - Uncle Travis. - Yeah. Mum said you're going to help, find Aunt Charlotte, is that true? Sleep time now. Uncle Travis. Yeah. Do you have a girlfriend? Okay that's enough you two. Goodnight kids. Goodnight. Sleep tight. Where's Zac tonight? He didn't come home last night. Just about given up on him. Maybe you could have a talk to him for me. I wouldn't know what to say. Just talk some sense into him. He needs to hear it from a man. I'm not real qualified for that kind of thing. I haven't seen my own son in a few years. Why not? Mainly because of his mother. She re-married and started a new life. The gist was that we just weren't very well matched. Eventually she found something better, I guess. And your son? My son loves him so... I was out of the picture pretty quickly... and I guess I just stayed out. That was just the easiest way for everyone. I dream about him a lot. All the time. Probably what gets me by. You going to take that? No, it's the boss. I can call him back. That's Charlotte's. She loved to paint. She wanted to be an artist when she grew up. Looks like she already was. What do these symbols mean? They're family. Sister... brother... mother. No father? No. We paint the fathers separate from the family. Feel a bit drunk. I need some water. It's okay, I'll get it. Your water. Think I better go. Yeah. Where are you? Yeah, alright. I'm on my way. He was weaving all over the fucking road. He's drunk, got a rifle in there. Gave me this. Told me to call you. Okay mate, I'll take care of it. I'll get him home. Look, I'm going to have to take him in. I said, I'll take care of it. Charlie. Charlie. What are you fucking doing? Where you going with that fucking gun? I miss Charlotte. I miss Charlotte. I miss my fucking kids. I wasn't there. I wasn't there. I wasn't there. You ever here anything around town about Charlotte? Like what? Like who might have taken her? Sick of people fuckin talking about it. Fair enough. I get it. Emma said you're a cop? Yeah. You killed people? Yeah. I killed someone once. Why'd you do it? I was in the drug squad at the time, things just... got out of hand. When you hang out with crazy people, sooner or later, crazy things willl happen. Did you take drugs too? Yeah I took drugs. Still am. Bullshit. No, it's not bullshit. And you're the only one I've ever told. So if you don't want to turn out like me... the best thing you can do is listen to your mother. She's not my mother. But she's a mother to you, yeah? When are you leaving? I'm not sure. Wish I could go. Get the fuck out of here. No matter where I go or where I've been... I've been saying that same thing my whole life, mate. When was the last time you saw your dad? Long time. You want to see him? Why would I want to see him? Because he wants to see you... and I think you want to see him too. Nice shoes. What's going on here? They're looking for some boys to take out bush. For what? Men's business. Alright off you go. Go on. Travis. It's me. Been trying to call you. Your case review's been cancelled. We need you back tomorrow. I've got two new homicides waiting for you. Let me know as soon as you hit town. Talk soon. Oscar. What is it? Just down here on the right. You carry a piece? Yeah. Cool. She said keep going straight. Turn down there. Got to walk from here... by yourself. How'd you know about this? Just heard stories around town. What else did you hear? Nothing else... just this. I haven't seen my dog. Did you see him driving in? Nar, I didn't see the dog. He's never gone away. Something's wrong. Maybe he's gone away to die. Animals will do that sometimes. Found Leon's car. He didn't sell it in the city, did he? It's not his. Can't be his. I ran a check. Chassis numbers match up. It's just a burnt out car... doesn't mean anything. Didn't say it was burnt out. I didn't say it was burnt out. If you say it wasn't the car then... fair enough. He saw her. What'd you say? He saw her... on the street... that day she went missing. Leon saw her on the day she went missing. How do you know? I saw her too. I was with him. Then what happened after you both saw her? We just drove on. Just... kept on going. Did you turn around? No. Joseph. Did you turn around? No. Why didn't you tell the police you both saw Charlotte on the side of the road? They would have kept on hounding us... for no reason. We'd never heard the end of it. You took him, didn't you? You took his dog. I haven't seen the dog. You're a liar. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? You leaving? The morning. So soon. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry about last night. - I drank too much. - No I'm sorry. They're not going to reopen Charlotte's case. Why? The review's been cancelled. For now, anyway. But why? It's complicated. I'm sorry, I wish I could help you but... I have to go. When you asked me if I'd gone to one of those parties... I did. It was about a year before Charlotte went missing... I went to Leon's place with some of my friends. It was my first time out there. And I woke up the next day. Maybe if I said something, things would be different. It's okay. It's okay. What's going on Zac? Yep. Get in. You right? Where we going? Out you get. Get out. Come on. You growing big. Cut your own hair? Yeah. How's your sister? Good. Yeah, where is she? - School. - School. You going to school? Little bit. What's a little bit? - Every now and then. - Every now and then. You're like me. Thanks mate. Cheers. Joseph. Joseph. Joseph.
