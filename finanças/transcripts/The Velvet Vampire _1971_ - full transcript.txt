You know, he used to sing on street corners. - [Susan] Yeah. - [Lee] I remember him when I just a kid. - Yeah? - Yeah. You're real easy to talk to, do you know that? - Yeah. - Hey. You come here often? - Whenever I want some ass. - Wow, that's kinda frightening, huh? - I get a lot of sensual energy from it. - You mean, it's sexy? - Yeah. (giggles) - I think he sculpts death. - Is that sexy? - That depends on your point of view. - Susan. - Oh! - I'm glad you came. - Hi, Carl. - Have you all met? - We've met, but we haven't been introduced. - This is Susan Ritter. - And her husband. - How do you know that we're married? - I'm Diane. - Diane, would you like a drink? - Yes. - Excuse us. - We? I'd like one, too. - [Lee] Sure. - Who is she, Diane? - Good customer. - Oh, you cut yourself. - Oh, that's not me. - What do you mean, it's not you? - It's from a cat. I found him in the street bleeding, and I couldn't just leave him there, so I took care of him. - Tell me about her. - I'd rather talk about you. - How is he? - He's all right. - Hey.

Diane has invited us to her desert place for the weekend. - Oh, I'd love to have both of you. - Well Susie'll love it, she's crazy about the sun. - Oh, you'll have all the sun you can handle. - Sounds cool, eh? (water splashes) How's the water? - What do you want? - Just passin' through. - Good, 'cause this tub isn't big enough for the both of us. - Come on, move over and make some room. (water splashes) What the hell are you doin'? - I'm still waiting for that drink. - What drink? Oh, so that's it. I forgot, so what's so wrong with that? - She's pretty, isn't she? - Susan, I only talked to her. - She probably has a great body. - Yeah, she probably has. - Well, you'll have a chance to find out, won't you? - All right, I tell you what. We'll forget the whole thing and we'll stay home. (engine hums) - You're sure we took the right turn? - Check the map yourself. I don't know, I thought it'd look different than this, more like Palm Springs. - [Susan] Hm. We haven't passed a car in miles. - I don't know what to tell you. (engine hums) (doors thud) (wrench clicks) How about some service? - Sorry, can't help you. - All I want is some gas. - I don't give gas. - Look, is it such a big deal to get some gas around here? - Look man, I'm a mechanic, I mean, I'm a trained person. And trained people don't give gas. - Ah, shit. You got a real smart ass over there. Give me a couple of bucks worth. Pretty deserted around here, huh? - The way the desert is. - Well, I'm lookin' for a house that belongs to Diane (fingers click). What's her last name, honey? - [Susan] How should I know? - Well, there can't be that many people around here. - You know the house? - Cash or charge? - Charge. - Can't you tell us how to get there? - Dead ahead, on the first right. - I hope the desert doesn't do that to everybody. (engine hums) (tires screech) (engine revs) (hood thuds) I knew we shouldn't have come. - Well, there's plenty of sun, you can help your tan along. I don't know, maybe I should start back. - No, don't. - Why not? - It's too far. (engine hums) - Hear it? A car. Now you're sure Amos'll tow the car in? - Out here in the desert, we help each other. It'll be taken care of. - How did you know where we were? - Just luck. - Well, the important thing is that you found us. (gentle instrumental music) - I'm sorry, I don't care for any. - I'll have Juan fix you a salad. - [Lee] Oh come on, Susie, taste it. - I don't care for steak tartar. - [Lee] Well, how can you tell if you haven't tried? - Lee, I have tried it. I just don't like the taste of raw meat. (phone rings) - Susan doesn't have to eat something she doesn't like. Juan will fix you a salad. - Thank you, Diane. - You're right on time. - [Mechanic] Always for a few bills. - Follow me. - Have you ever driven a dune buggy? - No, but I'd like to try. - No two are alike. Take mine. It's slow getting started. At first it takes a little manipulation. But once it's warmed up, it really comes alive. Then, you have to watch out, it's hard to control. - Yeah, you have to give in. - And then you feel like it's driving you as you move in rhythm with it, up and down, in and out. Through the dunes. - Diane, I think I'd like to drive your buggy. - I think I can teach you how. - I think I've had enough. I'm going to bed. - [Lee] What do you do around here at night? - Sleep. Mostly. - Well, if there's nothing else, then. - I'll make it up to you tomorrow, I promise. - I'll hold you to that. - Good night, Diane. (eerie music) - A young man is here. - Would I like him? - He's the same age as Victor. - You're good to me, Juan. (footsteps click) (door thuds) (heartbeat pounds) (footsteps click) (tool clangs) - Ow, baby. That hurts. I think you've got the wrong guy. - You don't want me, maybe you'll like him. (dramatic music) (mechanic thuds) (mechanic screams) (mechanic groans) (mechanic screams) - What was that? - Probably just a coyote. - It sounded almost human. - Sometimes they do. - Lee, I'm scared. - Come here. Come on. - Lee? - What's the matter now? - This place, I don't know. This room, and that mirror over there. It's almost as if someone were watching us. - Someone is. - Who? - You, my own little voyeur. - [Susan] Don't joke, Lee. I feel strange here. - Why, you've got a body guard. I promise to take real good care of ya. (dark ominous music) (Susan breathes heavily) Please? - I just don't feel like it. (lamp clicks) (gentle instrumental music) No! - What is it? - A dream, nothing. - Well come on, tell me. - We were in bed. In the middle of the desert, making love, and someone pulled you away. What's wrong? - Well, I was having the same dream, but you were pushing me away. (door knocks) Who is it? - Good morning. It's almost dawn, and if you wanna see the desert, we have to get started early before the sun becomes too strong. And be sure to cover yourselves up. - I don't wanna see the desert. - Susie, you don't wanna do anything. - Am I covered up enough, Diane? - Remember, this is the desert, and out here, the sun can be destructive. - You're not exactly a nature lover, Diane. - Oh, I am, but it can hurt you, the sun, if you let it. - Ya-hoo! Woo-hoo! (Susan yells) (midtempo rock music) (engine rumbles) How long has this mine been shut down? - Almost 100 years. - Why was it abandoned? - [Diane] Some of the miners started disappearing. They sent search parties-- - Disappearing? - Dying. Being killed off. - By what? - Some people thought it was done by a person who went berserk, others, from the wounds on the dead, said it was a crazed animal. But a few believed it was neither human nor animal. - Which was it? - Who knows? - Well, the wounds, what kind of wounds were they? - All the dead had large gashes on their throats. Ready? (ominous electronic music) There are lots of ribs running off this spine, so keep up. I wouldn't wanna lose you two. - [Lee] Don't worry, you won't. (object thuds) - Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. - You okay? - [Susan] Mm-hm. - [Lee] Diane? Diane? Diane? - [Susan] Which tunnel do we take? - [Lee] Honey, I want you to wait right here for me, and I'll go out and try to find her. And if I can't, I'll come right back. But I don't want you to go anywhere, you understand? - [Woman] Susan, Susan. - [Women] Susan, Susan, Susan. Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan. Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, (Susan screams) (dramatic music) - Lee, Diane! (Susan screams) Oh, thank god it's you! (sobs) - You were like someone drowning, Susan. I didn't mean to scare you. - My flashlight went dead, and I couldn't see. - Juan probably left them out in the sun. You can't do that, it kills the batteries. - Yeah, but didn't you hear me calling for you? - I got too far ahead, I guess. I must've been in another tunnel. But look what I found. It's the same stone as my necklace. Bloodstone. I couldn't help myself, I had to have it. There is no life without blood, and here it is, trapped forever in these tiny red veins. (midtempo rock music) - [Susan] You two go on, I don't feel like seeing anything else. - [Lee] You wanna go back to the house? - [Susan] No, I'll get some sun. I can do it here as well as there. - Do you mind if we go? - Uh-uh, it's okay with me. - What's your pleasure, ma'am? - You know, this is where the miners came for rest and recreation. - Oh yeah? - But they did a lot more than just drink here. - What else did they do? - [Diane] This. (snake rattles) (heartbeat pounds) (suspenseful music) (snake rattles) (snake rattles) (Susan screams) - Jesus, a snake! Susan, hold still and do not move one muscle. - It's bitten you. - Honey, you're gonna be okay. (Susan gasps) - I'll help you cut the puncture open. - Now hold on, honey, you're gonna be all right. (Susan gasps) Try to relax. (Susan winces) - If I don't suck out the blood, (Susan gasps) The poison'll spread. - [Lee] That's a good girl, honey, just relax. (Susan whimpers) - Don't worry, I'll take care of you. You're a very lucky girl, it's not serious. - Thank you for what you did. - Well, when you live in the desert, you learn what to do. Juan taught me. Out here, a woman needs a man like Juan to help her. - How long has he been with you? - Since he was a child. - Did his parents live here, too? - His people died on their reservation. - Then your family raised him. - Yes, he was like a brother to me. Now, I think the best thing for you is a midday nap. I always rest in the hottest part of the day. - All right. - Thank you, Diane. We can go home now if you want. - No, I'm beginning to like it here. (gentle piano music) (door knocks) - Yes? - I'm looking for a friend, named Cliff? He came out here last night to work for-- - [Juan] No one came last night. - [Woman] Are you sure? It was about dinner time. - [Juan] No one came last night. (door thuds) - Lee, Diane? (suspenseful music) Anyone here? (Susan knocks) Diane? (door creaks) - [Juan] Take your hands off that. - You're quite a watchdog, Juan. Diane tells me you grew up together. What was your family like? - There was no family. There was only Diane, and she took me in. - Then she must be older than you. Where's my husband? - With Diane. Sightseeing. - What are we coming here for? - You'll see. Tell me, could you live in the desert? - Not me. I don't know how you can, have you always? - Always. - What a waste. - Oh, I'd leave if I could. The truth is, I hate the sun. - Well then why hang around? - Because my husband is buried here. (gentle acoustic music) - When did he die? - About a week after we were married. - [Lee] Have you ever thought about moving the body? - I can't. You see, when he died, I had the Indians prepare him for burial because they know how to preserve the dead. - [Lee] Something about the desert? - Yes. If he leaves the dry air, he'll crumble to dust. - (scoffs) You talk about him as if he were still alive. - [Diane] The dead can live if you want them to. - No, baby. When you're dead, you're dead. Life is for the living. - [Woman] You're Diane, aren't you? - [Diane] Yes. - That guy at your place wouldn't let me see you. - What do you want? - I wanna know where Cliff is. - Who's Cliff? - He works at the gas station. He came up here last night to do some work on your dune buggy and he never came back. And he's straight these days, so something's gotta be wrong. - My buggy was acting up yesterday, but it was a false alarm. I called the station just before dinner and told Amos not to send anyone after all. - Cliff said he was going to your place. - Well, he didn't. - That's a new grave there, isn't it? - How should I know, I'm not the undertaker. (suspenseful music) (bird calls) (wolf howls) (birds chirp) (dog barks) (dramatic music) (woman groans) (woman screams) (woman screams) - Did you enjoy your afternoon? - It was okay. - You know, I was wrong about Diane. She's a remarkable woman. - She sure knew what to do with that knife. - Yeah. It didn't hurt a bit. - Well that's because you're so tough. (Susan and Lee giggle) - Lee, do you remember that Diane said her family raised Juan? - Yeah. - Well, this afternoon, Juan told me Diane had no family, that she raised him all by herself. - [Lee] So? - [Susan] That would mean Diane is a lot older than she looks. - I don't get the feeling that Juan is someone to trust. Goodnight, Susie. - Goodnight. (lamp clicks) (eerie music) (moves into gentle instrumental music) - Susie? (lamp clicks) (plate clatters) (gentle instrumental music) What the hell are you doing? - What about you? I thought you were sleeping with Susan. - How can you eat that stuff? - You ate raw meat yesterday. - Yeah, but that's liver, that's raw liver. - Ever notice people feed their cats raw liver? - Cats are animals. - So are we, but it must frighten us. We try so hard to forget it. Why fight it? - Fight what? - The animal in you. (eerie instrumental music) (footsteps click) - I'll take that. - Oh here, honey, let me help you. - Why isn't Juan doing that? - I thought I'd help out. Let's have breakfast in the living room. Sort of an indoor picnic. Coffee? - No. - Yeah. Diane, I need the number of the station. We have to leave this afternoon. - [Diane] I don't think you can. - Why not? - Amos called earlier. The part he ordered hasn't come in. Since today's Sunday, we'll be here until tomorrow. - Yeah, but I gotta get back, I gotta see a guy. - No hassle, call and postpone it. - Ah, I guess I could. - Sure you could. Anyway, we just got here. It's not police to hit and run. You know Diane, this place grows on you. I've seen things here I've never seen before. - Then you'll stay. - Sure. - Good. I get to have you two for another night. But enjoy yourselves now because I have to leave for a while. - All right, I got laid last night. That's what you wanna hear me say, right? - Right. - Well now, will you stop giving me such a bad time? - Sure. How can I put you down for something I could do myself? (footsteps click) (eerie music) - Hey, Susie. Susie, I'm right here, so don't play like I'm not. Aw look, Diane doesn't turn me on. She's a desert freak, and I'm a Susie freak. You wanna see what she showed me yesterday? - Sure. Anything Diane showed you, I wanna see. - Well, come on. - You sure know how to get to me. - You're god damn right I do. Come on. (laughs) Come here, you little beautiful little thing, you. - What what? Oh no, oh no! Please don't! (water splashes) (eerie electronic music) - Get out of here. - [Juan] You need me. - You're not what I need. - Why did you kill your husband? - I tried to leave him alone. - Then why did you marry him? - Why do you stay with me? - Because I can't leave you. You're suffering. You need nourishment. - I need more and more now. Something is speeding up inside me. - Let me help you. I'll get someone for you. I'll bring one of my people - You're good to me, Juan. You've always been good to me. (Juan screams) (engine hums) (birds chirp) - This is the fourth one that died in the 1870s. - Must've been a bad year. - Do you remember what Diane said about the killings at the mine? - Yeah? (eerie electronic music) - Lee, let's go somewhere else. - [Lee] Don't be afraid, everybody here is dead. Susie, come and look at this. - (gasps) Lee! (dramatic electronic music) Maybe it was some kind of animal. - No animal kills like that. - Did you see anyone around? - No. - Diane, there's one thing I don't get. The headstone said your husband died in 1875. - Easy, Lee. - No, he's right. I've wondered too. You see, that was originally the grave of Victor's great-grandfather. Now he's the one that died in 1875. Oh, years ago his body was stolen by grave robbers, and when Victor died, I buried him in the empty grave. - Why would anyone rob the grave? - Well, there's an old belief around here that people used to be buried with their jewels. - Yeah, but if they wanted the jewels, why'd they take the body? - I don't know. - And why wasn't there any dirt in your husband's grave? - Because if the dry air doesn't reach him, he'll decay. - Diane, what if someone still believes that story about the jewels? And Juan caught them robbing your husband's grave? - Maybe. Might even be a member of his own tribe. They can be very brutal. Juan became an outcast when he left them to live here. He gave up so much for me. He meant more to me than he knew, and I never got to tell him. - What the hell are we waitin' for? I'm gonna call the police. - No, no. That's my responsibility, Lee. I'll take care of it, excuse me. - What's bugging you? - I don't believe a thing she said, that's what. - What's this stuff about dry air in the grave? - Eh, she told me about she made her husband into a mummy and that the desert air preserves him. - How weird. - Don't worry, it's a lot of shit. - [Susan] Well, I think her feeling for Juan was real. - [Lee] I wonder if she can feel at all. - You are really down on her. - You know, the first night we met. - [Diane] It's from a cat. - And then, last night. - [Diane] You ate raw meat yesterday. - What about last night? - Nothin', as soon as the car's ready, we split. (moves into gentle instrumental music) (lamp clicks) - There's nothing. Anyway, this one was my dream. (gentle instrumental music) (phone rings) - Station. - [Lee] This is Lee Ritter, you got my car. - Yep. - [Lee] Is it ready? - Nope. - [Lee] It was supposed to be ready this morning, did you get the part in? - What part? - The part you ordered. - [Amos] Don't need no part. - Well then what are you waitin' for. - [Amos] Lady who called told me to wait for her go-ahead. - What lady? - [Amos] Didn't say. - Look, how long will it take to fix it? - [Amos] Can have it tomorrow. - I need it today! - Mister, I don't like shoutin'. Anyway, my mechanic ain't around. - Well when can I-- (phone clicks) (phone thuds) - [Diane] Susan? Enjoying yourself? - Sure. - Tell me, how long have you and Lee been married? - Almost two years. - Have you had another man since then? - I don't think that's any of your business, Diane. - Lee's nice, but-- - But? - He's not very observant, is he? Susan, have you ever noticed how men envy us? - [Susan] Envy us how? - The pleasure we have, that only we can have? We can't help it, it's just our nature, the way we are, and in their secret hearts, they hate us for it because they can never know what it's like. - Susan? I wanna talk to you. Alone. Get your things packed. - What's the rush? - We're gettin' outta here. I just talked to the guy at the station, remember Diane, she called and said she took care of everything? Well, she took care of nothin'. She's tryin' to keep us here, and I think that creep at the station is helping her. - Aren't you getting a little paranoid? - No, I'm not! And I don't like those dreams either, they're turnin' out to be real. - You mean for you. You've gotten what you want, so we leave. - Okay, what do you want? - To stay here a while. - I think you want her. - Maybe I do, how does it feel? - Where is that bitch? (eerie electronic music) Diane. (gentle instrumental music) - Close the door. - That bed. I called the station. You told them not to fix the car. - [Diane] You're afraid of me, Lee. - No. - Then why stay so far away? - [Lee] Tell me, the car, why? - Don't you understand? You should after the other night. I want you here with me. - I can't stay, I've gotta get back. - For a while at least. Ever since that night at the gallery, ever since, I knew I wanted you. I was hungry for you for as long as I could have you. You don't wanna go, you don't. - No. No, I. - Lee. Do you know who was always buried in that grave? - Your husband. - Yes. Only him. You see, I'm really very old. Do you care? - No. - Want me to? - (sighs) Yes. (Lee moans) (Lee groans) (door thuds) - Diane? (eerie electronic music) (Susan gasps) (dramatic electronic tones) (Susan gasps) (Susan knocks) Lee! Lee, where are you? Lee! Where's Lee? - [Diane] He's left for the station to see about your car. Is something wrong? - Your bed. That sand. - Close the door, Susan. - You've been watching us from that room, haven't you? - [Diane] Yes. - Why? - Don't you know? - [Susan] No. - You should. You did the same thing the other night. That was different, it was an accident. You could've turned away, but you didn't. - I saw Juan, Diane, in that room. Lee thinks you killed him. - Yes. - But you loved him. - Yes. He'll be with us now, always. - With us? - I want you here with me, Susan. Ever since that night at the gallery, ever since, I knew I wanted you. I was hungry for you for as long as I could have you. Stay with me. - Yes. (object thuds) What was that? - Nothing. Susan. Come back! (dramatic music) (Susan screams) (Susan gasps) (Susan screams) (Diane growls) (Diane screams) (frenzied electronic music) (Susan gasps) - Make up your mind, in or out. I got things to do. Travelin' light. - [Susan] I forgot my coat. - I got somethin', back if you want. - Didn't even thank me for stoppin'. - [Susan] Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. - Where you runnin' from? - No place. - Wasn't you stayin' with her? Don't have much to say, do ya? How am I supposed to know where you wanna go? - Wherever I can get a ride to Los Angeles. (engine hums) (bus hisses) (dramatic electronic tones) - [Announcer] May I have your attention please. Greyhound's Intra Courier Express schedules From Los Angeles to New York City is now available for boarding. (travelers chatter) - [Susan] Chief. That woman, she murdered my husband, she'll kill me, too. (announcer speaks in foreign language) - [Announcer] And if one should become available, every effort will be made to make room for your departure. Please board confirming your destination. Have a pleasant trip, and thanks for going Greyhound. (heartbeat pounds) (haunting music) (doors clatter) (dial whirs) - [Carl] Hello? - Carl, it's Susie. Listen, you've got to help me. Lee's dead, and she's after me! - [Carl] What are you talking about, Susie? Who's after you? - That woman we met at your place, Diane! I know it sounds crazy, but she's a vampire, and she murdered Lee! - [Carl] Susie, tell me what this is all about. - Look, don't question me. Help me! - [Carl] All right, come on over. - [Susie] I can't, she's still around someplace, and she'll kill me, too. - [Carl] Where are you? - [Susie] In the bus station. - [Carl] I'll be there in a few minutes. - Hurry. (dramatic electronic music) - [Diane] Get out! (Diane groans) (heartbeat pounds) (announcer chatters) - [Announcer] Some schedules will be delayed. (dramatic electronic tones) (heartbeat pounds) - Hey! - Like to buy a present? - [Susie] Help me, help me! Please! - Help with what? - Please, help me. Please, help me. - [Man] She looks scared. - [Man] Hey, hit her with the cross. - [Woman] Get her with the cross. - Yeah, get her. - Let's get away. - Get her! - Get her! - [Man] Hey, look at her go! - [Man] Get her! (heartbeat pounds) - [Man] Get her! - The sun! Help me take off her cape! (Diane gasps) (Diane growls) (fire crackles) How long have I been asleep? - Oh, a couple of hours. - [Susan] Have the police found Lee yet? - Yes. Some of her other victims, too. - Don't they wanna question me? - Tomorrow's soon enough. (cat meows) - Carl? How well did you know Diane? - Hm, pretty well. - [Susan] She wasn't just a customer? - Yeah, she was just a customer. But she told me a few things. - [Susan] Like what? - She had a rare blood disease. Her body couldn't manufacture its own blood, so she needed regular transfusions. It's what she came to town for, mainly. - But why did she kill Lee? And how do you explain her fear of crosses and the sun? - Well, I, I guess she freaked out. She probably needed blood so much she convinced herself she was a vampire. So she acted like one. - [Susan] But what about those dreams Lee and I had that all came true? How do you explain them? - They were your dreams, Susie. How do you explain them? - This knife is just like Diane's. - Yes, I sold her one. There are only five of them. They're collector's items. - She cut me with it. Ow! (haunting instrumental music) Carl.
