I got you. I got you. Come on. Go. No. No closer than that. Yeah, apparently Katie is like seeing somebody else, but it's actually a good thing, 'cause I don't want any distractions when I go over there. I need to be focused, you know? This is my chance. You got any more of those? - If Mom sees you, she's... - If Mom sees either of us. Look, Andy, I just... I want you to know I'm proud of you, okay? Being a part of something like this is a tremendous thing. What's up, Briggman? What's up, Rayburn? You're attracted to me right now, aren't you? A little bit, yeah. Wow. You're good. So this is what it's like to work at the DMV. We did these guys three days ago. Last week too, same fucking guy. LT wants us to check full biometrics. Get cheek swabs too. We're just going to let these goatfuckers go anyway. We can't arrest nobody, we can't fuckin' shoot nobody. Arms up. Come on, arms up. What is he saying? Stop! Don't make me use force. For God's sakes, Briggman. Alright, that's enough! Briggman. I said, that's enough! You look like the fucking Terminator in these things. You'll scare the daylights out of these people. And you. Look there. See them kids? Mmm. Raise your right hand. Move it repeatedly in a side-to-side motion. Now smile. That's right. Wave and smile. Wave and smile. You see how easy this hearts and minds shit is? I feel like a goddamn prom queen. Fuck you say, Rayburn? - Nothin', Staff Sergeant. - That's what I thought. Now I'mma go over there and give those kids some candy. You know why? Because I'm a goddamn prince. A salaam alaikum... Did you hear this bullshit about us having to do some security detail tomorrow? Sit down with the local elder leaders or some shit? Another KLE? I swear to God, the LT drinks more tea than Queen Fucking Elizabeth. If Sergeant Wallace could see us now, he'd be laughin' his ass off, huh? Yeah, well, he's not, so... The Civil War. Interesting. Morning, Sergeant. - This everybody? - Hooah. My name is Staff Sergeant Deeks. Some of you may think I'm here to replace Sergeant Wallace. I've been around long enough to know you don't just replace a man. I'm here to lead, plain and simple. I've got three combat tours under my belt. I move fast, I don't fuck around. I expect the same from all of you. Sergeant. Brief for tomorrow's mission. - It's the usual bullshit. - Oh, yeah? We stand around sweating our balls off, LT drinks tea with some old dudes. - Exactly. - Yeah. - Coombs, is it? - Yes, sergeant. You're dismissed. You're dismissed. Go back to your hooch. This is our mission. Cell phone trigger wired to Russian UXO. Whoever's making these has to answer for the deaths of 24 American soldiers in the past 12 months. Now, these motherless fucks are holed up right here, in our AO. And every day we don't find them is another day an American soldier could come home in pieces. Just like Sergeant Wallace did. Who wants to make a difference? That's not a rhetorical question. Who wants to make a fucking difference? Hooah! Good. I'm gonna make you a deal. You give me your loyalty and I guarantee that each and every one you will have a chance to be a warrior, to actually do something out here, to be a part of history instead of reading about it in some book. What are you doing? Relationship building, Sergeant. Don't do that. Village is shady a fuck. Roger that, Sergeant. So, gentlemen, what's the play? Put on a strong show of force. - Show of force? - Yes, sir. Is he serious? I don't know where he gets this shit, Sergeant. Ever been hunting, Briggman? Yeah, my dad used to take me, he was in the Marines. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Any combat tours? No, he worked a desk. Cool. So when your desk-job dad spotted a buck, did he roll up in his four-by-four? No, that would scare away the animals. Mmm. Briggman, you're with me. Good morning, shitbird. What are you up to? Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Relationship building. Holy shit! Let's move before he figures out how to aim. Who's ready to have some fun? Weppler, Coombs, secure the back room! Briggman, restrain that man! Please, please get on the floor. Hey! Sir, on the floor! Briggman, you're in control! Get on the floor! Get on the floor! Get on the fucking...! Stay the fuck down! Good work back there, Briggman. So I take this stun grenade... and I pop it... and I drop it in the stall. Bang! Brendan, the poor fucking bastard, he comes out the stall screaming: "Jesus Christ!" And that's, like exactly when the MPs rolled up, and they put cuffs on him because they thought he'd gone Section 8. Sergeant... Who's that, Daddy? - This is one of my new friends. - What's his name? Oh, my name? I'm Specialist Briggman. My name's Andrew. My new friend Andrew here has some very important news for Daddy. Which means I gotta go now. But I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Is that okay, buddy? Okay, Dad. I love you to the moon. And back again. 'Bye. Sorry to barge in like this, Sergeant. I put together a list of IED attacks by date and location. Why aren't you smoking hash with the rest of your squad? Wait, what? I don't know anything about that. You don't know what I'm talking about? This truck in the motor pool? Smoke wafting out of the hatch? I don't... I wanted to speak with you. You have my undivided attention. I've got a promotion board coming up. You want me to put you in as team leader. Yes. Yeah. I've got six guys trying for that job. You want it? Convince me. Yo, where the fuck is Brig? He's been gone like half an hour. Shh! - What the fuck do we do? - Open the door. Evening, boys. What are you up to? This is not good. Go see my man Darwesh at the ANA camp. He'll get you the primo shit. What the fuck...? Can you pass me that deodorant? There you go. Man, I'm thinkin' about getting some more ink. - Yeah? - Like a skull right there? Why don't you get one on your ass? "Insert wood here". Yeah? You know what those are, don't you? The skulls on Deeks' legs? Red ones from Iraq, blue from Afghanistan. Do I have to spell it out for you? What are you trying to say? He killed like, what, twelve fucking dudes? You don't win wars zip-tying people. I was with Deeks in Ramadi. This one day, he was on the checkpoint. SAW gunner. He had a car coming towards him. Crammed with towelheads. - Like, Fedayeen? - No. A family. Mom, Dad, little kid, the whole fucking deal. They wouldn't stop, so... Jesus fucking Christ. Fucked up, right? Wrong. Opened up the trunk, hundred pounds of HME stuffed in a fucking suitcase. Enough to barbecue the whole goddam platoon. That's how depraved these fucking animals are. Incinerate their own kids just to get a few of ours. That's why we need guys like Deeks. Fucking hard. - Coombs, how do you like it cooked? - Medium rare, Staff Sergeant. Medium rare, coming right up. Hey! Don't forget your reading material. Enjoy. Briggman? Bloody. Fucking caveman. Here you go. 3-2 and 3-3 will approach on the main road from the north. I'll be stationed on the south side, down here with 3-1. Ready to roll at 16:30. Questions. Good, one more piece of business. As you all know, we have a spot open on 3-2 for vehicle commander. Specialist Marquez? Yes, Sergeant. I understand you've expressed an interest in a team leader position, is that correct? Hooah. - Have you completed your IAVC? - Roger that. Very good. Now, what would you say if I gave the job to Briggman? I... I wouldn't know, I wouldn't suggest... Not exactly a ringing endorsement. You can't do that, Sergeant. Interesting theory. Let's test it. Briggman, the job is yours. It worked. - Thank you so much, Sergeant. - You're welcome. Just one little thing. You need to put Marquez on his back. What? You put him into submission. Otherwise I'll assume you're not qualified for the job. I'm gonna enjoy this, bro. Straight up. Yeah! - Come on, man! - Come on! - Let's go Briggsy! - Let's do this, come on! Get in there! Whoa! Got to get his shoulder down, man. Get him down! Shut him down! No, no! Fuck off! He just licked his ear! Yes! - I got him. - Lick my fucking ear... I got him. Marquez, you owe me a pack of smokes now. I did not see that coming. Crazy. You see that? Briggman! Hey, Dad. Guess what, I'm team leader. Team leader? Got my own truck, got my own soldier too. Things are really taking off for me. Is that why you've been ignoring us? I haven't been ignoring you. You haven't called in two weeks. Well, I have a lot of responsibility. We just want to know you're doing okay. I know, I'll be way better. I've got to go, though. Andrew... No, I've got to go. I'll talk to you later. 'Bye. Would you rather be in a boxing ring and fight a hundred duck-size horses or one enormous, horse-size duck? - How big is the duck? - The duck is like... - Do you have weapons? - You have no weapons, you have to bare-knuckle fight him, but they have the power... - Get the fuck out of my way! - What the fuck...? Stay back! Jesus fucking... - Get out of the way! - Got a pulse down there. - Sir, what's your name? - Bruer... Keep you eyes open. Stay with me. C'mon, let's go. - Go, go. - Go, go, go! Stand back! Sergeant? EOD is clearing the highway north of the blast site. Afghan police are tracking leads on the bomber's last-knowns. Afghan police couldn't track dogshit if it were stuck to their boots. - Help you with something else? - Yeah, it's... Sergeant Bruer. Is there any word? He's dead. If you're going to get emotional, don't do it here. Did you hear what I just said? Fuck those people, man. Fuck those motherfuckers. I'd like to see their whole country burn, man. Every village. Every goddamn house. Every bush, every tree. I just want to see this whole fucking country burn to the ground. That's quite a manifesto. Yeah, well, you don't win wars zip-tying people. I want to show you something. Bravo Company found him last night, out by the highway. He planted the IEDs? No, but I bet you a case of Coors he knows who did. What are we supposed to do with him? Not we. You. I want you to hurt this man. You're a good kid. Dude's face looks like a rhubarb pie somebody just fucking stuck his dick in. The thing is just all mush, face is all fucked up, nose is broken, like... You should fucking see him, bro. White man beating on helpless brown man. I think that is the first time in history that's ever happened. What are you guys talking about? You know that Muj they got locked up in Conex? Scarface? Yeah. Rayburn fucked his shit up big-time, bro. Stop looking at my cards. God damn. First Platoon found remnants of circuit boards and wires in a hooch here last week. The bomb makers are close. We're going to search every one of these villages till we find them. Sergeant Dawes, get ready to pull in First and Third Squads if it blows up. Hooah. Any questions? Right, let's move out. Hooah. - Not you. - What? What do you mean? Vehicle commander stays with the vehicle. - Marquez! You're with me. - Roger that. - Rayburn, Coombs, flank left. - Roger that. Good hunting. Hello. Give me a chocolate. Guys, I don't have any candy on me today. - No candy. - Hello. Hello. Look. Look, no candy. Chocolate. Chocolate. No candy today. Hey! You don't touch a gun! No, no! Stop it. Contact, contact, contact. So we turn the corner, and this crazy fucking Muj kid attacks us with a grenade. Yeah, like an old Russian grenade. Coombs opened fire. Grenade hit the ground... Danger close. Outstanding work, gentlemen. You two just made Bravo Company's employee of the month. Go get the village hoo-ha and see if he can give us an ID. What's he saying? My son. Fuck yeah! Fuck yeah, motherfucker! We fucking did that shit! We fucking did that shit! We fucking did that shit! Oh my God! We fucking did it! We fucking did it! Yeah! I would like to thank my parents for making me so awesome. And I would also like to thank my drill sergeant for teaching me that my gun is like a paintbrush. My first grade teacher, she believed in me. She said that if I... Fuck you! ...kept it up, I was going to get somebody killed. She was right. She was goddamn right. - Thank you, Miss Godel. - Miss Godel! You made me a specimen... What about Deeks? Don't you want to thank Deeks? - What the fuck! - No! How many times I tell you jerk-offs not to smoke that shit in the goddamn tent? - Dude, unclench. - Unclench? You can smell that shit from a fucking mile away. That's what I'm saying, it's good stuff, man. - You know what? - Get outta here. No, who are they gonna blame? Puerto Rico. Cocksucker. Or the black guy! I'm in here too. You look like you need someone to talk to. No, I'm fine. Thanks, Sergeant. I wasn't asking. Um... I just... I just keep thinking about that kid that we killed today. What about him? I just... Alright, let's take a walk. Come on. I was wrong about you. - Wait. What? - You're not ready to be a leader. No, I am, I'm just... Logistics could use a smart guy like you back at camp. You're good with computers, right? No....Sergeant, you don't have to do that. Work a desk, like your father. No, Sarge, I want to stay. We kill people. It's what we do. Do you have a problem with that? No, Sergeant. No, Sergeant! Here he is, Mister Sunshine and Rainbows. How are you feeling? I feel fine. Here. Let's see if we can fix that. - Hey, man. - Yeah? What was it like killing that guy? Did you ever hear of a conscience round? No? Okay, so my dad... He was like this major history buff, and... and he told that in 18-whatever, they used to execute spies by firing squad. But you see, occasionally, the shooters would freeze up and couldn't pull the trigger. So they came up with this idea. They would load one of the rifles with a blank. - And the blank was the conscience round? - Yeah. Now, nobody knew which gun had the blank. Not that it mattered. Once you put that one blank into the mix, suddenly it's not "I'm shooting this person", it's "we're shooting this person." It's all of us. And that's the key. It's the group. Once you figure that out, you can shoot anybody you want. And never lose a wink of sleep. Goodnight, Briggman. Yo, Brigsey. What is the good word, my man? You forgot to sign this. It's the shooter's statement from the KIA. The kid. - Yo, Brigsey. - Yeah. You're hovering. Sorry. Um... You said that the kid threw a Russian RGD grenade, right? Yeah, so? Just wondering because it exploded. How did you know it was an RGD? Because I saw it in his hand. But you were fifty meters away. How did you see that? What is this with the questions? I'm sorry, I just, uh... It just seemed like a funny detail to call out. Yeah, well, like I always say, Brigsey, stories are all about the details. We done? Yeah. Cool. I need to see the Captain. Can you tell me when he's around? It's very important. I'm not his fucking secretary. But you know when he's around. You know when he's free. - Talked to Sergeant Deeks yet? - No. Chain of command, dude. Please. Three minutes. It's all I need. Oh, fuck! Take it fucking easy, man! Stop digging into my fucking arm! Man the fuck up and hold still. Hey, yo, Brigsey. You should see this, man. Coombs is getting a big fat cock tattooed on his arm! - Hold still, man. - It's not a cock. - Oh, shit! - Shit! What the fuck, man? I see it, man. It looks like a fucking dick! I'm sorry, I didn't see that... You fucking piece of shit! How do you want me to fix it? Do you understand... Yo, Brigsey. Yo, fuck you! Shut the fuck up! Yo, Brigsey, you comin' or what? Yep! Yo. Yo. You guys seen Deeks? You seen Deeks? Do you know where Deeks is? Alright, look. He told me not to say anything, but CID called him in. Yeah. Some kind of investigation. Something about an anonymous tip. That's all I know. Yo, cut the gloomy shit. Deeks knows how to handle this. Okay? Whoever ratted us, better pray to God Deeks doesn't find him. - Yo, Briggman. - Yo. - Deeks is looking for you. - What? You saw him? Yeah, he just got back to his tent. Oh, and bro... he looks pissed. Hey, dude. You play? Ah, once or twice. Once or twice, my ass. I learned a few moves from my cousin. You know that anything that happens out here stays in the family, right? Of course. If you ever have any issues, you'll come to me directly. I really appreciate that. Do you? Shadow wins! Look at that. You won. Yo, Brigsey. What the fuck you doin'? I'm just doing PMCS. Come on, let's go. Team meeting. Now? What's the team meeting about? Deeks caught a rat. Let's go. Briggman. What the fuck you doing? Let's go. I just remembered I left the hatch open on the Stryker. Deal with it later. No, I think I'm gonna go do that because Deeks is... - gonna have my ass. - Deeks is gonna have your ass? He'll make an exception. Trust me. Let's go. Hey. Hope you don't mind we started without you. That goddam narc. He brought CID right into our house. And for what? Fucking hash? And it makes me wonder what else he's been talking about. - Wait, that's why CID came here? - Yeah. Yeah. Can you believe that shit? He called in an anonymous tip. But Deeks so in, Deeks has ears everywhere. You can't get nothing past that dude. Yo... We've got some big missions coming up. Deeks has a lot of stuff planned, so if you get a whiff of any other punk-asses with discretion issues, you let me know. They could spend the next six weeks in Medical, like Marquez. Brigsey. Are you with us on this? Hello? Dad. Andy. Jesus, what time is it? Are you okay? Are you safe? Don't call CID. Did you hear me? Deeks hears everything. He'll find out. You have to stop. No, look, we've still got some moves here. - No, no, no. - I just need you to stay calm. I'm going to get... Dad? Dad? Dad? Fuck! Fuck. What do you got? Bullshit. First Platoon got hit two days ago, right fucking here. What the fuck is he saying? He is complaining. You are frightening his wife. I don't give a fuck about your wife, bro. Briggman, put her inside. Shoaid, go get the village honcho. We need you to go inside. Just go inside, please. In there. Just inside for now, just inside for now, okay? Sit. Sit. Stay there! Stay there. You people aren't getting the fucking message! Where are you going? Goddamn it! Looks like they got the message. - He's hyping this up... - The last one you showed us... No, it's gonna be these guys right here. - Those ones? - No, right... these dumb fucks, man. - Look at it. - Whoa! Shit! I gotta get a copy of that. What have you got for me? They try to hide in this chicken coop, and then just get iced by an Apache. Come on, bro, I got that one from Travers like two weeks ago. Why you gotta hog all these fucking videos? Let me get a copy of this. Popcorn? No. No, thanks. Alright. I'll let you get back to your work. Thanks. Sergeant Deeks? Can I help you with that? Here, grab the other side. Now you can really dig in there. Ever seen one of these before? Huh? I saw a guy get ripped in two once. That was some crazy shit. So what were you doing here, Briggman? I know what's going on. Yeah? I can't be part of that. What, you think it's wrong? Yeah, I do. You think that man was innocent? He didn't deserve to die. Hmm... He was unarmed. Alright, so only if he's holding an AK, then he... magically becomes a bad guy, huh? They never know where the IED's are buried, but they always know how to avoid them. What the fuck is that? Huh? The will of Allah? Divine intervention? No. They're co-operators, Briggman. You kill one of theirs, you save ten of ours. And you're telling me that's not right. The Constitution says you can execute American citizens for giving comfort and aid to the enemy. And these motherfuckers should get a pass? Is that what you think? I'm sorry. Don't apologize. I appreciate your honesty. Yo, wake up, bro. Briggman? Time to go. Go where? Get your ass up and find out. So how you feelin', Brigsey? I'm good. How's everything at home? Everything's fine, Rayburn. Good. You talked to your family lately? What? Have you talked to your family? Why are you asking me if I've talked to my family? Why are you asking me that? - It's what people do, man. Coombs! - Yeah? You've talked to your family lately, right? Yeah, I called my mom yesterday. You should call them, man. They worry about you. Yeah, Brigsey. You should give them a call. You don't want them to think you're dead. - I'm out! - I'm out too. Hold your fire! - Hey, Brigsey. - Yeah? Do me a favor, go get the targets. - Me? - Yeah. Go get the targets. Go on. Why? You think we're gonna shoot you or some shit? Come on, go get the targets. Come on, Brigsey, go get 'em. Fuckin' pussy. My bad. That's not fucking funny! That's not funny! Let's keep the line moving before these little fuckers get burned. Alright, Sergeant Deeks. Bon appetit. - Thank you, Sergeant. - Enjoy. Next! - Here you go, Rayburn, enjoy. - Sergeant Deeks. Shit! You're a dead man, Brigsey. Come here, asshole! Fuckin' rat! - I got you, snitch! - Fucking snitch! Get the fuck off me! Kaden. Shit. That's my little boy. He does this thing where he holds his breath until his face turns completely red. And it fucking gets me every time. - What are you doing here? - He's always asking what I do. "Daddy, what's your work?" What do you tell him? That I'm helping people. He's only seven. But when he gets older I'll be proud... to tell him that I was a warrior. That my job was to kill... and I was damned good at my job. Are you proud of what you're doing out here? I don't... No, I get it. You're trying to do what you think is right. And I respect that, I really do. The problem is you don't even know what right means yet. And you're going to rain some ruinous shit down on a lot of good people. Including me. And I can't allow that. I have a son, Briggman. You understand? Good. Now, unfortunately, I'm going to have to threaten you. Yeah. Sorry. I really don't want to do this. But it's necessary. For both our sakes. Every time you get the urge to open your mouth, I want you to think of these little Muj fingers. Hey... I'm sorry it's come to this. Leave me alone. You are alone. Hello? Hello? Andrew? Is that you? Hi, Dad. Andy, are you okay? Are you good? Yeah, I'm good. Geez... We've been going nuts here, bud. Andrew? I don't know what to do anymore. Okay, just tell me what's going on. Do I do the right thing and put myself in danger? Or do I just shut up and deal with it? In danger? I don't understand. Andrew? In danger how? I want eyes all over this goddamn village. I want every military-age male... check that, every male, pulled and questioned. We're going house to house, four-man teams. Questions. Then let's party. Hooah! Brigsey, take point. Is there a problem? He's fine, as long as he watches his step. Huh? What? What did you say? You okay, Briggman? You look a little pastier than usual. Contact left! Get down! Anybody got eyes on target? About fifty meters! Eleven o'clock! - Fucker's got a bead on us! - We gotta move, man! We've gotta find cover. I'm gonna pop smoke. Briggman, you cover fire. Smoke out! Move, move, move! Fuck! Rayburn! Where are you? Is that you? Hey! I'm sorry. Come on. - What's the sitrep? - Village is clear, Sergeant. - Rayburn. - Over here, Sarge. Who's your new friend? Found him in the compound. He's clean. You want to do him? Security positions. Get these guys outta here. Down. Get down. Bend your knees, get down. - How was your day, Corporal? - Not good, Sergeant. Mmm-mmm-mm. Some crazy dude went Jihadi, tried to frag our asses with a grenade. - That's insane. - Yeah. What did you do? Well, I popped him with five-five-six, like I was trained. An excellent call. Right, ready on three. Three... Two... One. Hey, Briggman! Motherfucking Briggman! What the fuck is up, killer? Little Andrew Briggman, all grown up! Fuck yeah! You fucking did it, man. How do you feel, huh? - How do you feel? - I feel good, I guess. You guess? Come here. Look around you. Look at all those smiling faces. Yeah, motherfucker! Is there any better feeling than making your brothers proud? Yeah! Fuck yeah! ♪ Let the bodies hit the floor ♪ ♪ Let the bodies hit the floor ♪ ♪ Let the bodies hit the floor ♪ Hey. You're back from Medical. Where is everybody? Where's Rayburn? Rayburn. You won't be seeing that piece of shit around here anymore. What the fuck are you talking about? Pussy thinks he can jump my ass and not pay? Fuck him. What? Where the fuck is Rayburn? I told CID everything I know. You better hope your hands are clean. Hey, where the fuck is Rayburn? If I were you, Brigsey, I would think seriously about what you're going to do in the next ten minutes. They're coming for you too, bro. Specialist Briggman, are you in there? Hello. Yes, yes, he's my son. Is he okay? MP, open up! Open the door! Open up! No, no... Listen to me, there's been a mistake, you... That's not right. Hey! Open the door! What's up, Brigsey? Hey... They're sayin' I'm a murderer. Believe that? You don't think that, right? Lighten up, dude. They won't find shit. I got rid of everything. You know, I've done this a thousand times. Just stick to the story and we're good. You don't think I know exactly how to play this game? You don't think I'm ten moves ahead of these fucking clowns? We are good. - Briggman. - I heard you. I don't know what they told you, but whatever they promised is a lie. I will protect you. I promise you. Fucking say something! Time to go. Oh, God! Hey, bud. We got you, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Okay... Andrew, I need you to tell me everything that happened. Everything you remember. Just take it from the top, okay? Dad... It's going to be fine. You tried to stop those guys. Then they arrest you? You're a criminal? You're the hero here. It's okay. Tell him what happened. You didn't kill anybody. Please. I don't understand. Andy?
