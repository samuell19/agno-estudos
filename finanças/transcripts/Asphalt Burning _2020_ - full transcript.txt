NETFLIX PRESENTS THE RACING IN THIS MOVIE WAS DONE BY PROFESSIONALS. DO NOT ATTEMPT. Okay! We're partying today. But take it easy, because tomorrow is the big day. We're going to have a wedding race up Trollstigen. Because Roy will drive for love! For Sylvia! Want to be in the picture? My girls, you look so good. Smile, Dad! Tomorrow, you'll be married! Okay, say "car key." Car key! - One more time. Car key! - Car key! Thank you so much for... Come on, let's dance! Then we had you... I'm the toastmaster. I decide. When did you and Roy become such good friends? We haven't always been, but this is about something else. - What is it about? - "What is it about?" Love, Boccia! - Have you seen Roy? - No. Want me to take Shelby? - Yes, could you? - Sure. Hi there, Shelby! Let's go for a walk. - Is that Shelby? - The world's coolest half-sister. - Has she started talking yet? - We think she's close. 1948, 318 small-block. He hasn't been himself since he got hit by that bus. - Does he have a brain injury? - I don't know. One... five, four, two, six, three, seven, eight. What are those? Lottery numbers? - It's the engine's ignition sequence. - Does he know it by heart? He can hear the firing order of the cylinders. Listen to him! I thought you were kidding, Doffen. A hearse? Check this out. What do you think? 429. Big-block. 472 big-block. - I was looking for you. - Were you? I'm ready. I'm getting nervous. This is huge! - It isn't exactly us. - Sure you're ready? - For what? - Spending the rest of your life with me. Come on. Let me see... There. Now you look stylish, Roy. Great. Listen. I talked to some German lady last night. - Any idea who she was? - German? That must be Robin. - Robin? - Yeah. That chick Sylvia lived with in Germany before she met you. Didn't she tell you about Robin? - Is Robin a woman? - Yeah. We talked about a man she lived with. Robin is a man's name. Like Robin Hood. Nope. Robin's a woman. What did you talk about? That's the thing. I'm not really sure. It's a little hazy. Gotcha. Okay, folks! First one to the top... wins the bride! And... we drive in the order the toastmaster, aka me, has decided. And Roy will go first. Okay? Let's go! There's a speed bump that's trying to pass. A what? A speed bump. A Porsche! So I am to keep it behind me? What kind of car is it? Porsche 991 GTS R Turbo S. How desperate are you? Don't mess with my procession! - Listen... - TT, are you there? - I screwed up in the curve. - Are you okay? Beat that car, Roy! You have to be first to the top! Get moving! First one to the top wins the bride, yes? Have you learned Norwegian? What does she mean? I don't... - What's she talking about, Roy? - I don't know. I didn't know that you two had... I was drunk. I don't remember. You fucking idiot! Sylvia? Sylvia! I don't get it. What's your problem? What the hell were you thinking, you moron? It wasn't like that. Hey. - Sylvia. - You know what? I'm tired of this. The wedding is off. Please... Nina, put the car seat and the bag in the Porsche. Come here, baby. No way. Listen up. We have to have a rematch. He deserves a chance to win the... bride back. Anything else would be unsportsmanlike. No. Sylvia, please. Sylvia! Sick! She got into a Porsche! An Amcar girl got into a Porsche? Sick! But I need you. I'm working hard on my Norwegian. Opinions differ on how to stay in a relationship... - How's it going under there? - Just have to tighten the drain plug. That's good. Hey. Who's up for a kebab? All set, Nybakken! Come on. - We can't be in such a hurry. - We have to sit at the table. Hi, it's me. I understand that you're disappointed and angry. But we have to talk. What happened was just... It was just... All I know is I'm crazy about you. I love you. Okay? Talk to you later. I hope. Dad? This is no good. No, it isn't. Women! She just ran off with Shelby. That's crazy. - And that German broad... - Stop it. This was your fault. This is the third time you've screwed up. I know. See what's happening? You're losing Sylvia, Shelby, everything. You're destroying the entire family. I know. Buck up! How? What can I do? I can't beat a Porsche down there. You have to try. One thing my dad taught me is that it ain't over till it's over. My engine's knocking. I have to check the plugs. What happened to your GT86? All that water killed it. - Doffen and Nybakken have left. - I'll catch you before Malmö. No way, I'm driving. - Come on! - Safety first. I'm driving. Nybakken? You have a crush on Wenche Myhre. Give me a break. I do not. This'll be fun. Can you believe we're going to Germany? I'm not sure it's such a great idea, Doffen. Yes, it is. We agreed on this. - They won't let me in. - What? Why didn't she tell me she was with a woman? What else hasn't she told me? You have been pretty... unfocused. - When? - You act like a horny teenager. You run from conflict. You forgot Shelby's christening, and you forgot Sylvia's birthday. Hungry? We can stop here. You're saying I'm unfocused? I may be a little spacey. - But unfocused? I mean... - Dad... Dad! Son of a bitch! - Are you okay? - Sure, no problem. I didn't see you. Sure you're okay? Damn, a Mustang! A '67 Mustang! Cool! It's almost an honor to be hit by a '67 Mustang. It's important to be positive. I'm alive, after all. And life is a party. And if one party sucks, there's always another. Anyway, see you later. Fuck. Wanna drive? Yes. Hi, Roy. Listen... I'm at a gas station. - And Nybakken wants to back out. - But he's our mechanic. Apparently, his German teacher said his German was so bad they'd never let him into the country. - Die Wenche! - Die Wenche? - There she is. - Die Wenche! We know all your songs! He's got a bright red rubber dinghy With this rubber dinghy We're going out to sea He's got a bright red rubber dinghy And only at dusk will we get home We have no sail We have no engine And no galley Oh, no We're bobbing with love and a lot of humor Towards our eternal bliss Hi. Hi. You're following me. That mascara is very becoming on you. - Nybakken! - Just the right color for you. Nybakken! But you should be careful. You could poke your eye out with that brush. What are you doing here? This is Doffen. My buddy. - Hi. - This is Wenche. Wenche Synnøve Myhre, born February 15, 1947. One of Scandinavia's most beloved and popular artists. We need to get moving. Roy says we have to go with him to Germany. No question about it. - Are you going to Germany? - Our buddy is racing at Nürburgring. How exciting! I'm heading in that direction too. - Really? - Yes. Yup, we're going to Germany. - It was nice to meet you. - What's the rush? Bye. Let's go. Come on. - Come on! - I'm coming. Stop nagging. - What are you doing? - Helping him. But we have to... - Hello there! - Hi. They seized my car. Said I was a traffic hazard. Okay, you don't say? Want us to drive you somewhere? - No, don't worry about that. - Good, then we'll just... But my wife lives in Uddevalla. If you're going in that direction, I'd love a ride. Hop in. Really? Awesome! What are you doing? Now I have to make small talk with a total stranger. - It's only to Uddevalla. - Only? I'm sure you have something in common. Can't leave my favorite shirt behind. Maybe we should shake. - Roy. - Roy. What? Is your name Roy, too? You bet. Ice cream, Nybakken? A popsicle. With three colors and chocolate on the top. If they have that. A popsicle. Will do. Hello. Hang on. The window tends to get stuck. Aren't you a little early? - Probably. - It's no problem at all. Boys, come on. Let's see. If you could just sign here. Here you go. - Write my name here? - Yes. Right here? Yes. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you. Okay. - So they had it? - You bet. I think it's hilarious that they call it "glass" in Sweden. - They call ice cream "glass"? - "Two popsicle glasses, please." Yes. Here we are. - Thanks for the ride. - My pleasure. If the party sucks, move on to the next one. I'll remember that, Roy. Roy and Roy. Man, that is awesome! - Roy and Roy. - Yeah, great. - Bye. Take care. - Bye. Yes, bye. - Bye. - Bye. I'll take over from here. Man, you're pretty! Could you maybe give me a ride to Malmö? My ex-wife lives there. - Sure. No problem. - Great. Awesome! I said I'd catch you before Malmö! No problem! Roy. Cheer up. You'll get married eventually. Why do you care about all this wedding stuff, TT? - I believe in love. - Why aren't you married? I haven't found my dream lady yet. What does your dream lady look like? She's into cars. She's smart. A good mechanic. And makes good soup. Hi? Hi, Sylvia. Honey. Me and the boys are on our way. We're heading south. But... I miss you. And Shelby. And if I lose, I can't... Hey, Roy! Get your pants on! You can't run around naked! I'm just washing them. What are you doing? Don't you have pants on? No, that isn't me. It's another Roy. Another Roy? A Swede called Roy. And I met a Dane called Sylvia. No, it's true. Roy and Roy. Two Roys. Get your act together! Sylvia? Hello? Let's eat. Your dad is a complete mess. - Thank you so much. - Our pleasure. Bye! Finally rid of that Swede. - Catch a cold? - Not at all. It's my house, too! Go to hell! I hate you. - I've had enough of you! - She's so fucking... You're insane! - That's my grandfather's. - I never want to see you again. - No! - Have you lost your mind? Get the hell out of here. Get lost, you friggin' idiot! That wasn't a great party, either. Could I come with you to Germany? My daughter lives in Hamburg. Does she have any weapons? - No way! - Good. This'll be fun, Nybakken. Imagine. Germany. Yeah. Relax. They can't deny you entry just because you suck at German. - They might. Here he comes. - It'll be fine. At, on, behind. In, next to. Over, under. In front of, between. Nice car. Auf Wiedersehen. Vielen Dank. Hi, honey. How are you? It's your dad. I'm in Germany, and thought... Hello? - Your daughter couldn't meet you? - No... The timing wasn't quite right. Hi there. Hi. Got your pants on again? Right. Yeah, funny. Yes, and you... Something you want to say? Not at all. - No. Where's Shelby? - Asleep in the car. When's the race at Nürburgring tomorrow? Okay, that suits us just fine. See you there, I guess. Yeah, we will. Can't we stop this now? This is stupid. Racing each other and all that. Can't we just go home? That kiss... We never talked about how that was. Was it just a little peck? Or was it more "full package"? It was more like this. Like that. Wow. I haven't been kissed like that in 30 years. Hey, Doffen. - What's with the coffin? - Coffin? Look. What the hell? Nybakken? - Yeah? - That coffin... It wasn't here when we left Oslo. - It wasn't? - No, it wasn't. Okay... There's no reason to panic. - No reason to panic? - No. We're driving around with a corpse! No reason to panic? What the hell is this, Nybakken? I've never seen her before. She's no relative of mine. Sorry, folks. We have to bring her back. No way. We can't do that now. It's a corpse. She might start smelling. It'll be fine. We'll drop her off on the way back. Another day won't matter. Finally, now you're back on track. - We don't have time for this. - We can't let a corpse stop us. What's this? Roy Gundersen. The Norwegian legend. Who's this cowboy? I have no idea. Lemmy Müller. The Mustang Killer of Hamburg. With these pork chops. Nobody touches my pork chops. Doffen, these guys are nuts. I'll go wait in the car. What's your problem? You want to go for a swim, too? - Way to go, Roy! - You're the best! What the... Damn! The drain plug's missing. What? Wasn't that your job, Nybakken? If so, I've made a huge mistake. Sorry. - Don't worry about it. - I'm sorry. - This is unfortunate. - You don't say. Now you might have lost your only chance to get Sylvia back. Roy's Auto Service? Insane! What are the odds? Roy, Roy, and Roy. German Roy, Swedish Roy, and Norwegian Roy. That's you. The crank is broken. That's what I said. You shouldn't have driven. Listen up. This car has to be ready by tomorrow. Period. What? Are you giving up? You're driving tomorrow. I'm so sick and tired of this! I'm being solution-oriented. - You're not the toastmaster anymore. - The wedding has only been postponed. Is that... Nybakken, is it possible to replace the engine on Little Yellow by tomorrow morning? We'll have to replace the headers, brackets, pulley, fuel pump, clutch... I can make a new skid plate myself. So it's almost possible? - More or less almost possible. - Exactly. Freddi, Fritz, Franka? We have a job! Yes. Daddy. Yeah. - Should I call? - Call. Good evening. Sylvia? It's me. So, I'm no longer your girlfriend and you call me crazy? No, I didn't say that. It was a misunderstanding. - Right, was it Swedish Roy? - No, German Roy, actually. I know it sounds crazy, but everyone we meet... is called Roy. What the hell? - Really? - So hard with all the Roys. We have to leave. Now! Damn, I'm sorry. Let's go. Nybakken will do the last adjustments on the way. Okay. No, that's stupid. Is it that way? You have to get going, Roy. - I'm fine. - You have to get well. - He stays here. - I'll catch up. I'll stay and take care of him. Yes. - Good luck with your love life. - Thanks. You, too. Good luck with your... life. - Roy, let's get moving. - Yeah. I ordered a new kitchen yesterday. Italian brand. Best design. Very expensive. The first thing I'm going to make is lamb. With a lovely risotto. Flavored with saffron. So, Berry, will you miss me? It looks like our safe-driving campaign has worked. There are two sides to safe driving. One side is that... it makes my days incredibly boring. Okay, then, let's start it. Try now! No. Come on. You have to try properly. A bit more gas, then try again. Step off the bus. Is there a problem? - Routine inspection. - Excellent. You know, back in Norway, I'm a police commissioner. This bus driving is only something I do while on leave. Much respect. That is a very nice... - Car. - Yes. Car. We say "patrol car" in Norway. Code 11. Irresponsible driving at high speed. 250 kph. You may continue. Mørk? What is this? What did I say? There's always someone. What do you think? - Ferrari? - Lamborghini. Ten euros. Roy Gundersen. What was that? - Back on board. Now! - What are you doing? Sit down. We are assisting the German police in hunting down a Norwegian criminal. I want everyone to buckle up until further notice. Buckle up! No one, I repeat, no one is to use the toilet during this operation. Back there? Is it this one? Soon, now. Come on. Try again. - No. - I don't know. Damn. Thanks for nothing. I can't hear what you're saying! Careful! Try now. Try the gas. Nybakken! Try now. Come on. Nybakken, get in here! It's the cops! You can shake them. Not with that trailer. It's too heavy! What are you doing? No! Nybakken! No! Stop! What? What are you doing? Why did you do that? Why did you do that? - You said it was too heavy. - But the whole point... Look at that. Dad! Dad, we have to go! Unhitch the car! We'll catch them! Come on! Come on! Go! Damn! Go back! - Out of the way. Everybody move. - Get out of the way. Get into the cars. Careful, Berry. This car is brand new. No one messes with me on my Autobahn! Out of the way! Where's the Norwegian? He left an hour ago. I don't know where he went. I know where he went. He's on his way to Nürburgring. And you... I'll deal with later. You heard him. Later. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Very good. We have to be at the Nürburgring by 4.00 p.m. Check the map. Yes. Okay, let's see. - We're on the wrong side of the Rhine. - Okay. We've to cross that bridge. - It's not far. - Okay. Okay. Come on now. Berry, careful with the car! Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop the car! You have to stop! Yes. Tighten your seat belt. What is he doing? Holy shit! - Berry, don't even think about it. - Hands off. You're messing with the wrong man. No! Berry! Now what? Oh, no, not today! No! Can you swim? It's official, Dad. You're totally insane! I got us across the Rhine. I'm going to lose my job. And my pension. You and your insane driving! This isn't over. Not yet. Not over? What are you talking about? We have to report this. Colleagues. I have analyzed the situation. You are in need of help. - What's going on? - Vacate seats one and two. - Why? - Just do it! Enter. - Doffen? - Hi, Nina. Listen... Sorry about that misunderstanding. And that Nybakken unhitched the trailer. It's okay. We got off the trailer and evaded the cops. - We're on our way. - Okay. Bye. Relax, Nybakken. They're fine. They managed to get off. Nothing to worry about. - Seriously? - They're doing fine. - Of course Roy can shake off the cops. - Of course. - Never doubted it. - No. I had lost my appetite, but now I'm ready for a celebratory meal. Excellent idea. Boccia Geir? It's Philip Mørk. Roy Gundersen teased me about being a bus driver. I thought I'd show some self-deprecating humor by letting him see the bus. Then you'll have to be quick. - Where is he then? - He's in Germany. Nürburgring. How far is the Nürburgring? So they're going to Nürburgring. Oh, no! Could we stop for a bite? We will continue to assist the German police. - The situation is code red. - What is code red? As a visiting officer on German territory, I request permission to use this. - Permission granted. - No! Get out of the way! Hi there. We're here. We made it. So... Hi, Shelby. Hi. We got to ride in a Porsche. That was fun. She and Robin have become friends, and... We had a great time. How'd you like Little Yellow? Nice? Check out that engine. With a new roll cage and stiffer springs, we should... Hey, Nina. How's it going? Fine. Why are you the only two here? Where are the other Roys? Well... That's a long story. But we're here. That's all that matters. Okay, dear friends. Clearly, we have... I love you! You're insane! - I liked that lump of meat. - Me, too. - And the cabbage. - Yup. - Hi, Nina. - Where are you? We have to get the car ready. The race starts soon! - We'll get there as fast as we can. - Yes! Bye. Let me pay, and we'll take off. - Darn. - Lost your wallet? What the heck? I must have left it in Hamburg. - Doffen, that's a serious mistake. - Yes, yes. Admit it. Nybakken? Let's get out of here. It'll be fine. Nobody will see it. Nybakken, help me out here. - Aunt Ruth is a little frail. - Put her here. She's softer than I thought. Get her under there. - There. - I've got her. Let's see. These will help you see better. There. There you go, Aunt Ruth. Now you can have a closer look at the menu, while... Get lost. Hey, guys! The brother-in-law wanted to help, and I was made co-driver, so... Seven minutes? - Nope. - I don't get what's wrong. Four more minutes, folks. Come on. - Try now. - I don't understand. You know what? Forget it. I give up. Let's go home. - No way! - Yes. This party isn't over. Roy Gundersen. If you give up now, you'll end up like me. You don't want that, do you? Do you want my life? Do you want to wake up in ten years and realize that no one that you care about wants anything to do with you? Every time it gets tough, you run away. Is that a life worth living? No. No disrespect, but your life seems... so-so. And that's why you have to drive. Drive. Drive for love, damn it! - Okay. - All right, Roy. - Let's get this thing running! - Yes, come on. - Try starting it again. - This is where it is. - Hi! - Hi! My sound check in Stuttgart finished early. Hi there. Hi, Wenche. A seal is stuck in the main jet. - Say what? - A seal is stuck in the main jet. - Really? - Yeah, a seal. It sure is! We need something small and sharp. Anything. Hurry! Let's go! - Can you find anything? - No. Come on! Roy! - May I borrow that? - Yes. But... - Wenche's mascara brush. - Perfect! Got it! - Come on! - Start the car. Come on. Come on! Yes! Look at me. Remember what he said about Döttinger Höhe. Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Let's go! No, no, no. Please. Please. Thank you! - No! - Damn it! Roy, where are you? Come on. Faster, faster! Put the hammer down! No! That damned Lemmy! Excellent. Did you request backup? Did we? They aren't after the Mustang. They're after us! Sit down. No problem. This has happened to me before. No problem? This is a huge problem for the entire world! - Stop this bus! - Now, now! Look! - Come on! - He's close! Yes! And this is all thanks to Wenche's mascara brush! Are you trying to steal Wenche Myhre from me? - No! - Keep your paws off Wenche Myhre! Come on! Stop the bus! Come on... - It's okay, focus. Focus. - All right. I've had enough of this! Drive for love, Roy! Drive for love. Döttinger Höhe. Give it your all! Wait, Dad. Wait. Now! Yes! Sylvia, I know I'm a moron. And I know I don't deserve you. But I need you. And Shelby. Without you, I'm a miserable lone wolf. Well, not a wolf, a polar bear or some other weird animal. Roy... Shut up. But do you want to marry me? Yes. More than anything. Yes! All this romance makes me sick. Roy Gundersen, you have laughed at Philip Mørk for the last time. I love the smell of rubber in the morning. You all know this one. - Nybakken... - Stop. I know what's going to happen. - Come on. - I'm serious. I'm terrified of moments like this. Heads on your laps. Brace position now! In 13 seconds, Roy Gundersen will be neutralized and ready for arrest. Relax. I promise. What could possibly happen? Doffen? Ma'am?
