My dear co-pilot, thank you for the five wonderful, difficult years you spent with me. You can be proud of your husband, and of yourself too. Without you, I wouldn't have had the strength to follow my path. It's really fast. Here we go, here we go. The blue one's free. No eating during the ride. If you puke, I won't clean it up. He's scared. This one's staying. Table 10: Jacqueline Schneider, Luisa Kettner, -Asli Bilgin, Paulina Grubka... -We're together! Now for the carnage! Well done! The fat stays down there, and you've completely removed the skin. And remember to tug the spot where you're cutting. I know, it's pretty tiring at first. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten! No, that would be too crazy. Your turn! I dare you to kiss her. Nice. Spin it, man. -Truth. -Oh come on, be a man! Truth. Come on, truth? I know everything about you. Okay. What is your biggest regret? I don't really regret anything. It's called "truth", remember? Everybody regrets something. Don't be such a bore! OK. Sometimes I regret coming here. To Germany? Why? The truth is I don't want to do dentistry. -My parents want me to do dentistry. -Really? -Come on. -Yeah. You give people beautiful smiles. That's really something. But people in Germany don't smile at all, they don't need dentists here. We smile! In Lebanon people smile much more, that's for sure. -I miss that. -Really? What about the war? -There's no war anymore. -It ended in '90. -Yeah, I was 17. -I was 15 or something. We're still at war but people are not killing each other anymore. But everyone hates everyone in Lebanon. -Should we go on? -Yes. You earned it. Truth. What's the most dangerous thing you've done? We played this game, pass out game, in school, do you remember? -Pass out game? -Yeah, do you know this game? Can you explain to us? It was really silly and dangerous. I was 14 and... You breathe really shallow and quick. And then someone does this... And you pass out. And when you wake up, you'll get a euphoric feeling. -OK, shall we do it? -No! -No, I'm not doing this. -Come on! This is gonna get interesting! -Come on, I'm serious. -No, I'm not doing this. -Oh, Asli. -No. Someone get the camera. I'm serious, no. Can I do it to myself? You can teach me. Teach me how to do it and I'll do it to myself. -OK, breathe shallow and quick. -Like this? -He's faking. -Yes, he's faking. -I didn't push it. No. -He just wants to cuddle. Oh god, it was so good! -Thank you. -You're welcome. Who wants to do it? Who wants next? I know, we just met each other but it comes from my heart. And I worked so hard to find it. -Thank you. -You're most welcome. Hey, what are you doing? I'm swiming naked, isn't that what Germans do? I'm Turkish. All the blood is in your head, you study too much. Come on! I want to go skinny-dipping! Put your pants on! -Will you come if I put my pants on? -Maybe. Okay. Come on! -You wanna try to go down? -No, it's really cold. Come, we'll do it together. Hop on. Go, Horsey! -What is that? -Go, Horsey! -Horsey? -Yeah, it's like a horse. Go, Horsey! One, two, three! -Are you OK? -Yeah. -Are you okay? -Yes. 1st YEAR Saeed is getting married! Congratulations! Hallo Asli! Hallo. -Asli, when can you come to Lebanon? -Hello, nice to hear your voice! I've heard so much about Lebanon. I'd like to come soon! But I have to study for an exam. And I also have to save money. Money is not a problem. You're getting married to our son! Of course you are invited! Thank you, thank you! And you're family is invited, too, Asli! I mean, we pay for five of them, but don't bring more! Got some money? She's very beautiful and intelligent. She wants to heal cancer. Sometimes it's good to listen to your mother. No woman wants to marry a pilot. They're never at home and the woman has to worry. I'm sure Asli agrees. Don't you? Why? What happened? Doesn't matter. She was talking to you! -Let's call your mom. -She's sleeping now. -No, she has to wake up really early. -I'll pretend to be someone else. "Hello, you just won the lottery!" Next time. -I want to see her soon. -OK. OK. You never told me that you want to be a pilot. When I was young, I always had the same dream. That I was flying. My mother would come and wake me up in the morning and I would want to go back to sleep. To dream and get the same feeling. The same feeling that I fly. -So, you want to do it? -Yeah... My mother thinks it's not a good idea. That it's a good hobby but it's not a good job. So... Why? You could still go for it. -You wanna be my copilot? -Yes. Oakland Tower, this is United 135, requesting permission for take off. Copilot, extend the flaps. -The wings. -The wings. Exactly. And we are ready for take off. Here we go. And lift off! Fantastic! We stabilise a little bit, yeah? And that's great. -Copilot, check the altimeter! -The altimeter? Where is it? The altimeter is somewhere here. It shows our altitude. -OK, here! -No, no, that's the eject button! No, focus. Focus. Please check the altimeter, it looks like a clock. It's 500. 503. -Meter. -Feet? Do you mean? -Feet! -Perfect. Oakland Tower, we are at 503 climbing to 6000. Say hello. Hello! -Are you flirting with them, habibi? -No. -You need to focus! -I'm sorry. Tell them. Hello Tower, here is Asli, I'm the copilot. I just wanted to say you can look at me but don't touch because soon I will be married! That's right, Oakland Tower! We are getting married. I repeat: We are getting married. And we enjoy the view. So you're lying to both of them. I haven't been lying really, I've... I'm going to tell them eventually, so it's not a lie. You're moving in together soon, aren't you? What's your mother got against Arabs? It's a cultural thing. -Crazy, I've got it! -What? -The nervus accessorius! -Nerd! -Just like in the textbooks! -Look how delicate it is. Man, I'm starving. Hi. -Come on, let's go. -Ten more minutes? -No, let's go! -Five? -No, I want to go. Two minutes. I thought you didn't like coming to the mosque. I don't need to come here to be a good person. But I like the people here. -Yeah, it's nice. -The feeling of community and so. Coming here always calms me down. What do you mean by "beruhigt"? -It means, it calms me down. -Yeah? -My mother's coming tomorrow. -For real? I want you to meet her. Finally. -That's nice! -Let's go. -I'll just say goodbye... -I'm not going back upstairs. Meet me here. I'll say goodbye, then we'll go. OK? Say, what is your name? You're called Horsey? What kind of a name is that? What kind of a name is that? Horsey. You're coming with us, OK? Our windows are always clean. You can look into the distance. OK? The building is old, but the rooms have been renovated. Clean and nice, with big windows. A lovely room, I really liked the apartment. And it's cheaper. Do you know the girl from college? It's not a girl. It's one of my classmates... ...from college, a guy. We're a respectable family! Men and women as roommates is normal! Please! What if you come out of the bathroom naked? Your dad wouldn't have allowed it. I won't come out of the bathroom naked. He has a girlfriend. -Mom, I know his girlfriend. -Take a deep breath. Breathe, Mom. Don't worry, please. Ebru, bring the perfume, it's in her bag. -Does your back hurt? -Leave me alone! You embarrassed us in front of the entire family before. It was your father's last wish to see you with a red ribbon around your waist. And you! Everything's about your career. It's all that interests you. -Leave Dad out of it. -What do you know about your dad? You ran away back then. Ebru and I looked after him till his last breath. Mom, we didn't want to talk about that. Ebru, bring me my cigarettes. -Please don't. -Let me go. Mrs. Bilgin. -I've been wanting to meet you. -Me? I'm Saeed. -Hi, Ebru. -Hi. Who... Are you the student that Asli wants to move in with? -Yes... -No! He isn't. Just a friend. What does your girlfriend think about it? -My girlfriend? -Yes. -What does she mean? -I don't know. Mom, please... I think she's been keeping me secret from her parents. -I don't know why. Maybe you know. -Me? I come from a good family, I'm at university. -Where are you from? -Lebanon. An Arab! -Mom, our train... -Mom, it's not like you think. Tell him to go away. Please! I fast like you do, we pray in the same direction. Why can't we talk? Asli and I are a couple. And we want to get married. Pardon? We're a couple. Come on. Come on. We want to get married. I'm asking for your daughter's hand in marriage. Here, on the street, without your family? -Have you no respect? -Don't listen to him! -See what he thinks about you? -Speak! -You can't be serious. -Say something! -He's misunderstood me. -Say it in German. She said you've misunderstood her. She doesn't want to marry you. Now go! -Come here! -I'm sorry. -You're sorry? -Stop it! That's the only shit you can say? "I'm sorry"? What are you doing? Asli! We have been waiting for half an hour. This is the building. Let's go. Saeed. La Corniche! This is it. When you walk to the kitchen through the restaurant area, you're coming to this big, beautiful hall. For events that we can rent. And then we'll make a new ceiling. With wooden panels. And with a light on every panel. And on this side we have big windows. Habibi, I like it. But for that we need money. A lot of money. -Our uncle can give you the money. -For example. But Fares, what about college? Is better to follow the heart. This is what I want to do. -What did your parents say? -He doesn't need his parents. -He's a grown man. -Seriously, what did your parents say? He doesn't need his parents to make a decision. Do you know about that? Making your own decisions? Have you heard of it before? You didn't even tell her I exist. -You didn't even tell her I exist! Saeed. I said I'm sorry. What? Say it in German. You're a fucking liar, you understand that? If you want something, you fight for it. He wants to open a restaurant, he's gonna fight for it. -I'm fighting. -And he's gonna open this restaurant. Because he's a man of his word. Unlike you. What about you? You are here in Germany and you're doing that what your parents want. You wanted to be a pilot. Are you doing this? No! 2nd YEAR ...a golden bracelet for the bride. Thank you very much. Who's this one from? From the Anahn family. Thank you to the Anahn family. And another 300 marks. The Al-Arabi family. Thank you, thank you! We are blessed. And we should always be kind to one another. Even when we feel that we are powerless to change anything in this world we should always remember: When Fares manages to find a woman who marries him, that, my friends, is proof that everything is possible. To support our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Lebanon I donate this today in the name of your love. To give people who are not as lucky as we are a chance to be as happy as we are. I get you! Stop it. Stop it. I don't want to. Stop it. Don't be mad at me. -Can you carry that, Mom? -Sure. -What kind of neighborhood is this? -It's cheap and close to college. -This is no place for a woman alone. -I'll be fine. Mind the curb! I'm so happy for you. -Thanks. -Take care. Love you. Come visit me. Love you too. -Your uncle loves you. Take care. -Thanks. -God protect you. -You too. -Say hi to Aunty. -Go ahead, I'll just be a minute. Asli, don't meet him anymore. We don't meet anymore. Really. I'm trusting you. Thanks, Mom. -Look, I've hung that up. -I've seen it, thanks. -Bye. -Take care. Hallo, Asli. Listen, I'm sorry to say this again, but I can't come visiting you. I have to stay here in Hamburg. I have a lot to do with my studies. Aircraft engineering is harder than I thought. I hope you're well. Bye. Asli, what are you doing here? Come on, I'll introduce you. This is Asli, my girlfriend. Hello! -Come, sit down. -Do you like tricks? Can you remove the coin without moving the matches? Try it. I've no idea what he's up to. Open the window, OK? Sorry. It's "makruh" and not "haram." Because you can't quit. What kind of noise does a walrus make? -A what? -A walrus. Saeed! I can't do this anymore. What? But why? What will we do when we want to have kids? Shall we always live like this, in secret? But I want to be with you. You'll never say that to your mother. I want a proper relationship. I want kids, I want a family. I want to do what's right. I don't want to do things like the Germans: crashing here and there, sleeping around. I don't want that. It's not... This is not how I grew up. And this is not what I want now. We're not children anymore, but we're living like children. Then let's change things. This way round, three times. Three thousand? You must always stay with me. You must keep my secrets. And not show my weaknesses. 3rd YEAR He doesn't look like you. Luckily! He's mine, you can tell. You've gone all quiet, huh? How he's looking at us! I have to go to La Corniche. Bye, Sami. Bye. Maybe he'll get freckles like you. He shouldn't be going. He could take the day off on his son's birthday. Working all the time isn't right. We have to pay off the loan. -His uncle offered to lend him the money. -Why didn't he take it? You know Uncle Mahmut. Fares is proud. The Quran says that people who charge interest are the only ones that Allah threatens with war. That's a bit over the top. There are far worse things... Would you sell your body to others? -No. What's that got to do with it? -Right. If you pay interest, you're selling your freedom to others. -Only Allah should have power over you. -But sometimes you need money. But you can save up, ask your family... And if you have no family? He has one, his uncle offered him the money. -Why won't he take his uncle's money? -Because he wants to make it on his own. Why take money from a financial system based on slavery? It's not right. This system made the Zionist regime powerful. That sounds totally anti-Semitic. You Germans and your guilt. Say one thing against Jews and you're "anti-Semitic." That's wrong. You're being manipulated, just look at the world. Lebanon and Palestine, for example. Who are the victims? Muslims. Who started the war? Jews. That's a fact. But it's politics. -The Quran tells us what's right. -That's just what you believe. If you kill somebody, no matter what you believe, you'll be punished. For you, non-believers are as bad as murderers? -Don't put words in his mouth! -I'm not! -Have you read the Quran? -What's that got to do with it? -Exactly, you haven't! -Everything's OK, Asli. Even if it says in the Quran... You don't understand him, but you know he's wrong! -Come on, Saeed. -Asli, what's going on? Come on. Are you mad at me? -What were you so happy about? -Happy? You were just so happy. No reason. Who was he? -Who? -That guy. A friend from the mosque. Why didn't you introduce me? Do you like him? -Yeah, he's good-looking. -He is, huh? Yeah. Would you stop that, please? -It's bad for your health. -Why didn't you introduce me? What? -Do I embarrass you? -Embarrass me? Where did you get that from? What's going on in there? You gone paranoid? Are you crazy? The devil is speaking to you, my love. There's a devil in your head, dancing and telling you things. Give me that! Cut it out, that's enough! You're sick and you carry on smoking. Give me that! Come on, I'll make you some tea at home. Come on. -Who did you just call? -A friend. You're lying to me. I'm not the liar here. I've never lied to you. I know what you're hiding from me. -I read your text messages. -Which one? From my phone? -From my phone? -Yes, from your phone! -Why did you do it? -It doesn't matter. -Tell me what you know? -You're hurting me! -What do you know? Tell me! -Don't yell at me! You sound like a fanatic. Why are you going to Yemen? -Are you going to war? -Why are you spying on me? Why are you doing this? Who are these people you want to help? Do you want to go to war? I'll leave you. -Don't say that. -I'll leave you... I won't accept it anymore. I've sworn not to say anything I'm going away, that's all I can say. I love you, please! Please trust me. Do you regret marrying me? No. For me, it's the best decision I ever made, the best. I have something for you. Look. -Beirut? -That's right. -Why should I go there? -We'll meet there in a few weeks. I want you to meet my family. I want to show you Beirut, Lebanon. My room with the lovely view. What do you say? I need your support. I have to do this. No one must know I've gone away. You mustn't tell anyone. You have to promise, you have to swear. Asli! No one. Look at me. You promised me in front of the imam that you'll keep my secrets. Remember? I swear. Swear on your father. I swear on my father. You are my wife. -Asli. Asli. -Asli. Nice to meet you. I'm Saeed's mother. -Nice to meet you. -This is Rana. Saeed's sister. -Nice to meet you. -Welcome to Lebanon. -How was your flight? -It was great. Everyone is waiting for you. The house is packed. I can't wait to meet them. But where is Saeed? I don't know. We thought that you know. He didn't send us his flight details. He wrote us to pick you up and return to the house. Is it so hard to tell us when he is going to arrive? You know Saeed. He always does things his way -That's how he is. -He could at least told us when he arrives -Anyways, we'll wait for him in the house. -He'll never change. He should have been with you. This is no way to treat his wife. No need to worry. It will be fine. No, she doesn't know. Try to reach him again and tell him his mother is pissed. -And welcome home! -Finally you're here! -Hi Madame. -Hello, Niro! Go, take them upside. This is Saeed's papa. -I'm so happy to meet you, finally. -Nice to see you again. -And this is Batul, Saeed's sister. -Sorry, three in Lebanon. -How are you? -Hello. Asli. Asli, Habibi, what's wrong? I can see it in your eyes. Where's my son? What's the problem? You can tell me. Suleyma. Please, wait. Suleyma. Come downstairs. We have to talk. Sit down, please. Please, tell me, when was the last time you spoke to Saeed? Why don't you answer? My wife is worried. Please. Please, Asli, tell me. Where's my son? I don't know. Really. I don't know where he is. -I call Fares. -Yeah, call Fares. Fares wouldn't know. They don't speak anymore. -They had differences because of religion. -So what? We all have differences of opinion when it comes to religion. We are Lebanese. It's because Fares serves alcohol in his restaurant and Saeed didn't like it. Saeed doesn't like alcohol? Since when? Asli, when was the last time you saw Saeed? Answer. I don't know. Nine weeks ago, I think. Nine weeks? -I got it two weeks after he left. -From Saeed? It's not his handwriting. Please, please, Asli, translate this for us, please. He says that he is fine and that he misses me. He's fine. And that he misses me. That he will come soon. -And that he wants a child with me. -A child! Yemen? -The stamp says Yemen? -Do you know anyone in Yemen? -No! Why is he in Yemen? -I'm going to Yemen. -I thought you didn't know where he was! -I'm going to Yemen! Why didn't you tell us everything from the start? I'm sorry. You knew he was in Yemen, didn't you? -Say something. -What game are you playing, Asli? I think all these facts have to be known from the police. No! No, no! Please. Don't! Don't call the police, please! What do you think? We'll stay still like you and do nothing. Maybe he's dead! I want to change my flight for tomorrow. Before we involve the police, I want to find him myself. -But we're his family. -You're not going anywhere. She'll say nothing. Hello? I don't understand everything. Could you translate? I'm looking for people who know my husband. We got married in this mosque. The imam knows him. Has he seen him? He hasn't seen him. -What? -Not since the wedding. That can't be. He prays at this mosque. Maybe in another mosque. I'm really sorry. He doesn't know either, I'm sorry. Is there anyone else I can ask? No, there are only three of us here. Here in Hamburg? I'm looking for people who know him. He used to shop here. Maybe he was here with someone. What's the matter? What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Come. You work too much. Yildirim's son asked about you. He's a good boy. 4th YEAR I dialyzed this for 25 minutes and decreased the electroporation. Mr. Sannwald, come over here. And bring your colleague. Look. This is how it should look. You've blue clones and white clones. -Follow your classmate's example. -You have no hobbies, right? In human biology you either have hobbies or a job. You really did well. Darling... What were you thinking? Who do you think you are? Go away! Asli, open up. Open the door. I want to see you. I couldn't call you. I wanted to, but it wasn't possible. I wrote you a letter. Did you get it? Go away! -Asli, open up. -Fuck off! I came back. Open the door. Leave me alone! I thought about you every day. I missed you. I wanted to come sooner, but I couldn't. Open the door. This is for you. What the fuck is going on? Why did you leave me alone? Come here, darling. What was so important? Why did you leave me here alone? What have you done? -It's over. -What is over? It doesn't matter. Did you go to war? Did you hurt anyone? -Let go of me! -Asli, listen to me! Asli, listen to me! It's over. I've had it with Hamburg. From now on, there's only us. I'm going to move here and stay here. I want to be with you. I screwed up. I screwed up. I can't make it on my own. I couldn't... I could only come here. I wanted to see you, talk to you. I missed you so much. We'll start over again, I'll quit university, I'll move here. We'll stay together. I want to become a pilot. Fuck Hamburg! I really mean that: fuck Hamburg. I just want to be with you. I'll make everything right again. I'll try to find a training school for pilots. If I train to be a pilot, we can live anywhere, wherever you want to. The main thing is that we're together, you and me. I'm tired. I'm tired! Go away! Fuck off! -Go! -I've nowhere to go. -Are you expecting someone? -No. Just a moment. What if he comes back? -Let's call the police. -No, no. No police. It's over. Saeed! Are these people dangerous? No. -No, no. -You sure? Yeah. He can't do anything. Let's do something nice tomorrow. I'm going out. Where to? -What do you need? -Two glasses. Give them to me. You're having a drink, too. I don't drink. Drink! Drink! Asli, please... Nice and smooth! You're staying here. You're going out like that, alone? I'm going out with a friend. -What does that mean, "with a friend"? -You don't know him. It's a man? What does this mean? Got everything out? Come here. Don't sit in your puke. Sorry. I've done so many bad things and he didn't leave me. But he did. He ran away. Has he told you what he was doing? And if it's a criminal act? Will you still cover for him? Why don't you just go to the police? You don't know what love is. Did you call him? -He's fucking you over... -He loves me! Sure. That's why he was away fighting for four months. Because he loves you. You don't know how it feels. He loves me. That's why he came back. Get up. -Are you Tobias? -Yes. -Did you call me? -Yes, I called you. All right. Good that you're here at last. Go away! Go away! -What do you want? -My jacket! Wanna be a man, huh? -What's wrong with you? -What do you want? -You want to lecture me now? -Fuck off, both of you! Wow, spitting is great! You're a really great guy! It's huge! You'll need it when you have lots of kids. There's someone here. He's hiding. Come here, little mouse. Yusuf, this is your mother. Have you said hi to her? Asli, this is Yusuf. Come on, Yusuf. This is for Yusuf. -Pink for the boys? -Pink for the boys. -This is for Zohra and... -Gül. -Yusuf's trainer called. -Yes? He said he's the best basketball player in his team. -No! -And he has a six-pack. -Really? Like me? -Yes. Come here, I knew you were like a man. You rascal! I knew it! Come here! You can be proud of him. You must always stay strong, like your mother. So you can protect her. Do you understand? You must always follow your heart. Where are Zohra and Gül? Zohra? Dinner! She thinks we haven't seen her. It's always so cute! OK, let's eat. Delicious. Saeed? Saeed? I've been offered a place at a flying school. -Really? -Yeah. Where? It's in the US, in Florida. Florida. The training is much quicker and costs half. There's one place left in Miami. I could not say no to the offer. 5th YEAR Are you well? So long? Yeah. It's been a while, huh? It suits you. Thanks. -It's a shell, huh? -Yes, a... When I talk to the family in Beirut, they ask me why he's in the US and how he's paying for it. What should I do, lie? Remember how he used to talk? The US is evil, the US is the enemy of all Muslims and we have to fight. Asli, what's wrong with the boy? Asli? What are you doing? Hey! -Like the one from NSYNC. -Yeah? But he's blond, isn't he? -No, the other one. -The handsome one, huh? -Shall we? -Yeah. Beautiful car. Beautiful woman. -What are you doing? -Let me! Be careful! That's Kyle. -Do you remember? I told you about him. -Yes. -How are you doing? -Good! Hi. -I'm Graham, how are you? -Asli, nice to meet you. I heard that you were coming over here. I'm glad to see you. -Yeah, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. You can talk to him for a while. I'm gonna go get my tools over here. -Nice to see you too, Graham! -Oh, yeah. Good to see you! -He talks about you all the time. -Oh really? -You're like some kind of miracle. -She is a miracle. She is the smartest woman I know. She'll be the first woman who cures cancer. -Congratulations! -Thank you. -Kyle, is there water in there? -No, it's fine. -Come on, check it, please! -It's just a crack. -What's that here? -It's fine. What are you so worried about all of a sudden. You know what you're doing. -Asli is flying with me today. -Good luck! -But we are flying together, right? -Yes, we are flying together. -We? -Yes, we. And he? -He's still learning. -Kyle, he's still learning, right? No, he's got his license about, I don't know, five minutes ago. He'll be fine. -See you. Don't put our school to shame. -Bring that back, please. OK, bud. That's Kyle. -I got my pilot's license. -Really? -Last week. -So quickly? I'm in process for the commercial one now. To fly big planes like this one here. -You wanna be my copilot? -Yes. A proper co-pilot. -Co-pilot Asli. -I can't hear you. In a minute. I'm coming. 1486 MIC ready to go on 9 on right. 1486 MIC called for kick off runway 9 right for the right turn shut down. 1486 MIC cleared for take off. Right turn. There we go! Crazy! -You're really flying! -Great, huh? I'm not gonna fly very high. I wanna keep us low because I wanna show you around. Alright. OK, copilot? -Yes, OK. -Fantastic. -It's beautiful. -I know. Everything looks so tiny! Do you see that building right there? The small one next to the big one. -Yeah. -We're passing it now. -Here did you live? -Yeah, I had an apartment there. Tamiami Tower, 1486 MIC change frequency. Change approved. Have a good flight. Want to drive? "Drive"? -Yes. -No. -Yes! -Try it. Put your hands on. -No, I can't! -Put your hands on. -No! What am I supposed to do? You're flying. No hands on the wheel. I'm flying! Go, horsy! Does it hurt? Can you please promise me to see a doctor when you're back? I read something about an isand. Melanesia. During World War II there was an American military base there. Airplanes came, dropped food and clothes for the soldiers. There were natives living on the island before the Americans came. They thought they were dropping gifts from the gods. They'd never seen planes before. Can you imagine? After the war, all the soldiers left and the airplanes didn't come anymore. To call them back, the natives did what they'd seen the soldiers doing. They thought it was a kind of ritual and... that they could speak with God. They made the same movements that the soldiers had made and carved headphones out of wood, but the airplanes didn't come. Maybe they're still waiting for God to answer. Could you imagine living in Boston? -What? -I've found a research team. They're doing research into brain tumors. We could go there. I believe everything is possible. We could go to Melanesia too. I've heard that people who go there live forever. Now say "heh." And now an "eeh." -Hello? -Hello, habibi. Habibi! -How are you? -I'm fine. -Yeah? -Fine. I love you. I love you too. I love you. I love you too. Is everything OK? Ms. Bilgin? -I'd like to take you with me. -Just a moment. I'll call you back. -I love you. -I love you too. I love you. This is Saeed Awad. Please leave a message after the beep. This is an act that requires a perfect terrorist organization, but certainly not a huge army. Those who carried out these attacks only needed to bring together a few dozen people: people who would stop at nothing. This is the worst attack on the US since the outbreak of WWII at Pearl Harbor, when an equally unprepared nation had to suffer that attack. This is how it's being viewed. Did the terrorists force the pilots to commit murder and suicide? Or did they fly the planes into the towers themselves? No one knows the answer. Their identities are still unknown. In the US, it's assumed that the attackers came from the Middle East. Hi, this is Jen calling from the Florida Flight Training Center. Can you please call me back? It's urgent. This is Saeed Awad. Please leave a message after the beep. -Good evening. -Good evening. I haven't been able to reach my husband since yesterday. He's living in the US. His flying school left me a message. -You have to call them with me. -But in Miami, not in New York? What's Miami got to do with us? Call them from home. No, I want to call from here. -There's a phone booth outside. -I'll deal with this. -Just do what I say! -No phone calls! Go to the embassy tomorrow, OK? I'm staying here till you make the call with me. I refuse to leave. To your right. Sit down along here. Thomas, I need to ask the lady some questions. Thank you. OK. Call them up. Florida Flight Training Center. This is Jen, how can I help you? -Here is Asli, I'm the wife of Saeed. -I'm sorry. Did you say Saeed? -Yes. Can I speak with Kyle Jacobson? -Saeed Awad, are you sure? -Yeah, yes. -Hold on a second. Kyle, it's urgent! Yeah, this is Kyle. Hello Kyle, here is Asli. The wife of Saeed. -You said I should call you back. -Yeah. Yeah, I did. -Why? What happened? -There's something wrong with the phone. I can't hear anything what this person is saying. -Can you hear me? -Yes, of course. -You called because of Saeed, didn't you? -Yes. -You said, I should call you back, so... -Right. That's right. I did. Do you know if we can get in touch with him? -Because the FBI contacted us. -The FBI? Yeah. The FBI contacted us, here in the US, and until we know where he is, he'll continue to be a person of interest. We're looking for people who can prove it otherwise, you know? -Quick! -I have tried to reach him myself. Earlier I couldn't understand you, the connection is better. You're his girlfriend or the mother? I am his wife. Maybe you remember, I was in Florida, too. Asli, is that you? -Yeah, yes. -Asli, oh, OK. Okay, last Tuesday did you talk to him? Did he call you the day of the attack? Do you know if he called you from Germany or America? I think from America. And... but you don't know which city he called from, is that right? -No, no, I don't know. -Okay. The address we have in Germany... Is this the address you're calling from right now? I am now... I live in Rostock. -I'm now with the police. -Alright. I'm really sorry that I have to say this, but the authorities here in the US, they believe that Saeed flew one of these planes. And that's why they're looking for him. If you hear something from him, you gotta let us know immediately. Okay, Asli? Do you have a message? The only thing that I can tell you is, we don't think he's alive anymore. Hello? Asli? -Hello. -Hi. Officer Müller, police station Rostock. Yeah, she is still there. Yeah, sure, yeah, I can do that. ...it was an inside job to create conditions that would lead to a new war... -The government is behind it? -I don't believe it. If there aren't enough wars, they create reasons for war... -But I don't believe... -That's a conspiracy theory! There's lots of theories. We'll have to wait and see. Time will tell what really happened and who was behind it. I reckon it was terrorists. Apparently they found passports... ... America wants revenge. The armed forces are on high alert. They could launch a strike within 15 minutes. Thank God you left him back then, otherwise they'd never leave you in peace. He's caused so much suffering. I'm telling you, this is the beginning of the end. At the bakery they think Ebru is a criminal because she wears a headscarf. The Quran says killing is "haram." They've damaged our entire religion. That's exactly what the terrorists want. To spread as much hatred as possible so they can say: "Look, everyone hates us." At college, one girl said this could be the start of World War III. One thing about the boy struck me as odd: the look in his eyes. The look in his eyes wasn't normal. He seemed totally normal to me. It wasn't written on his forehead. You didn't know him! Did you really know him? Can I get witness protection? We can't decide that here. If necessary the public prosecutor will determine that. Why do you want that? Are you aware what it means? You might not be allowed to see your parents and friends again. Depending on your level of protection. You'd have to live a new life. You might have to leave your research team. Yes, I know. When did he mail this? The day before. -Here. -But you signed for it! I don't want the package. Ms. Bilgin! First of all, I want you to know that I love you with all my heart. Never doubt this. I love you. And I will always love you, for all eternity. I have left this world, but I'm waiting for you in another place. Where I am now, a life is just a moment. We'll soon be together again. Thank you for the five wonderful, difficult years you spent with me. They were the best I had on this earth. I wasn't always the husband you deserved. And not the one I wanted to be. I want you to be happy, even if it means you marry again. But always think of who I would like. They'll tell you lots of things about me. You'll know what to believe and what not to. I trust you. You won't understand now, but the world I'm leaving you will be different. You'll see the results and everyone will be happy. I will always be with you. I'll watch over you and always know how you are. My beloved co-pilot, you can be proud of your husband, and of yourself too. Without you, I wouldn't have had the strength to follow my path. You will be my wife forever. Thank you. Your husband, Saeed Awad. September 10, 2001.
