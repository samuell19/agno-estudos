What does Russell say? Fucking pig. Hey, I can lend you the 50 bucks now if you still need it. Dude, really? Ah, you're awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Actually, I might need some help - after daycare this week. - Yeah. Russell watches him, but it makes me nervous sometimes. Here, forgot to put that back in his diaper bag and these are for you. Oh, shit. Where did you get those? I love those. Thanks. I gotta go. Hey man. I'm sorry about that shit man, okay. Look, it's just, uh - it's okay. I'm good. - Is she alright? - Yeah, yeah, yeah... She'll be fine. She asleep right now, I just gave her meds. We didn't have proper introduction. I'm-I'm Jayden, um, I'm her nurse, her caretaker, whatever you wanna call me. I'm here pretty much every day for a few hours. So if you see me again, you don't have to like, you know, kick my ass. Look, if you gonna stick around, maybe, um, do me a favor, feed those dogs. Honestly, they scare the shit out of me. All right. Also too, if you can, ah, there's a number on the refrigerator, if you can give them a call, somebody's giving away a wheelchair. You know, your mom when she walk around, her legs hurt, you know, so that chair would be really nice for her. Okay. Welcome home. Good to meet you, Marvin. You too. Okay, so, it looks worse than it is. She's really going to be okay. She's gonna need some help when she gets home. You gotta make sure she takes her meds. Hey. You got money? Yeah. What do you want? Let me get the xannie. Um, the, um, syringe? Hey. And the blue ones. You got any girl today? None of that. You gotta get that somewhere else. Hey, uh, you know who's getting out today? Fuck you talking about? Marvin fucking Hacks. He got out today. I don't fucking care. Hush! Hush. Mom. Mom, let me do that. Okay. Marvin? Marvin! Hey, it's me, Father Browning. - Hey, Father. - Hey. Come on. Uh, yeah. It's so good to see you, yeah. I heard that you were back in town. I mean, the whole town heard you are back in town, but how are you doing, son? I don't know. I'm okay, I guess. How's Bernadette? Is she happy you're back? I'm not sure. Yeah. When you went away, it was really hard for her. I spent a lot of time with her, you know, up at the house, trying to talk her through it. You know, thanks, Father, thanks. "Thank you, Father, thanks." Come on. Man, that's what I do. That's what I'm here for, right? Anyway, we're only here for a fraction of a second. Not like we all matter that much anyway, but I'm here, and the church is here for you. If you need us, you know, if it gets too hard. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Come on. - Bye, guys. Take care. Hi, yeah I was... I was calling to see if that wheelchair was still available? Yeah. Go ahead. All right, when... when is a good time? Now? Okay, thanks. Hey. What do you want? The wheelchair, I'm here take a look at it. Unless you sold it already. No, you can see it. The left wheel is a bit wonky. Imma fix that. How much you want for it? It's actually not for sale. Okay. Look, I have to go, so... Hey, I see you made some new friends, huh? These two assholes never liked me. The wheelchair thing didn't work out. Damn. Uh, okay... Okay, we'll just get another one, uh, for now, just let her use the cane. Doctor wants her to move around anyway, so, uh... cane should be... should be fine. All right, well I'ma go inside, get started. You enjoy these two all right? Okay, I'll see you. What do you mean he was here? Here, Russell, he was here. So, he's out? Yeah, obviously. Hey Ricky, get me a beer. Give me the fucking control. Give me the fucking control. - I want to show you. - Dude... Why was he here? Wanted to see the wheelchair. What did he say? Goddamn it Russell, nothing. He didn't say anything. He wanted to see the fucking wheelchair. He looked like a total asshole. Okay, and then what? Fucking talk! Hey Aidan? Uh, for fucks sake can you please take that dog out, I'm tryna have a conversation here. Then, nothing. I didn't give it to him, obviously. Jesus Christ, man, take that dog out. Ron said Martha's looking for workers at fair trade. So... Did you want to just fucking like, punch him? Fist fucking fuck him up? Yeah, you know... I don't know. "I don't know. I don't know if I would've." He's a fucking pig. You know what? You should... you should... you should've called me... 'Cause I would've fucking killed him, would've killed him right here. Yeah, I call my big brother to kill a guy who killed our grandma 20 years ago, that woulda helped. Shut the fuck up. 'Cause that's besides the point. Aidan! Keith! Take the fucking dog out! Delta took him out a half hour ago. Don't drink in front of my boy. You stink. And get these fucking losers out. Who hangs out with his own cousins this much? God. Thank you for dinner. Welcome. Are you going to stand there all night? Sit. Remember how to play Slapjack? Of course I do. Get us a beer. Are you even supposed to be smoking and drinking? Your uncle Teddy died of lung cancer. Five years ago. Ruthie died two years later. Your cousin Brian moved to Fresno. Uh, and Rosie died... 12 years ago. My God, you don't even know. Things happen. You don't even fucking know that. Treat you all right in there? I don't know. I guess. It's a Queen. Prison's not supposed to be fun anyway. Ow! You need help, mom? I've been shuffling around this fucking house for the past 17 years by myself. I'm fine. Go, get my... get my little oxy tank. You got any money, mom? - Huh? - Cash. I need... I need to get food. Oh, okay. What happened? Someone threw a rock. Oh, God. We haven't had any rock-throwing around here since the night police came and took you away. They got your egg throwing. Somebody wrote "murderer" on the garage door. That was attractive. Your uncle Teddy built the fence and got the dogs, the party was over. Bring back some cigs. And, uh, some Twinkies. Twinkies? Yeah. Let's have a celebration. You're here after all. It's the Hacks boy. Was that Bernadette's? - He got out. - Fuck that guy. - He's really odd. - Jesus Christ. Uh, just two. Just... Promised me a rubber ducky. Now, look, make sure you get all the suds off this time, okay? Rubber ducky, you are too grown to be having a rubber du... why do people have rubber duckies in the bathtub anyway? It makes everything happy. Let me know if you need anything. We're just fine. What was that in there? No, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? That was... Look, he's trying, all right? You could see he just want to help. Why are you so hard on him? What's that face, huh? Just doesn't feel like my Marvin. He's not going to be the same person. He was locked up for 17 years. Plus he's a grown man now, you got to see that. So you can act like you don't care or you don't want to, you know. You... I don't care, you're just making this face, whatever, he's-no, that's not true. Every time you've been asleep, you would yell his name out. Hey, Marvin why don't you come take a seat. Oh, man. Would you mind helping me out a bit? I want you to do it. Hey, could you do me a fa... could you... could you grab that for me? I forgot, 4:30 the van's supposed to be picking her up. May... maybe that's the driver. It stopped. Jayden. Marvin? She's just finishing up an infusion. May I have a word? Your mother has stage 4 lung cancer. Unfortunately, she came to us too late and the cancer has spread to her bones. One of the tumors is pressing against her nerves, which is why she's having difficulty walking. Considering the circumstances, she's dealing with it well. Hopefully, you'll stay out of trouble. People do change, I believe that. How long? That's hard to say. A few weeks, one or two months, maybe more, maybe less. Make sure she gets a lot of rest and she gets up to move around once or twice a day. We'll keep the same pills as before but if the pain gets worse, give me a call. Oh, you only live once, right? Take your dirty money. You're not letting me win just because I'm dying, right? Don't say that again. Don't tell me what I can say or not say. This is my house. If you don't like it, you can take off, just like your old man. Wade? Wade. Fu-fuck yeah. We're fucking babies. This... this is crazy. I'm practically like a toddler here. I know. Look at these fucking stripe. That was almost 20 years ago. I was gone 17 years. Time's crazy. I remember so much here from so long ago and I don't even remember what I did yesterday. And your mom's still around? I haven't seen her in a while. She's kind of a cool lady. Tell her I said hi. She probably won't remember me. No, she remembers you. Well, you like pizza, huh? I mean fuck. Yeah, I work four times a week at DoughMan's pizza. - DoughMan's? - Yeah. That mu... that must be new. They kind of just- I don't know, like, give me leftovers and shit. You want to see something? Sure. Are you ready? - Uh, yeah. I'm ready. - Okay. - Holy shit. - No. Woohoo! I've had contests for this shit and stuff. I... I... I did 19 though, 19 seconds. Yeah. Nice. You've got to try. You've got to try. Try, just try one. Like this? Yeah, no, no, no. Start there. What else have you been up to? Like, the past 20 years or whatever? Like wife, babies or... I guess I've just been fucking folding pizza boxes and shit. Last time I saw you I was in court. - That's right. - Yeah. But I can say thank you. Just for the record. For what? You didn't do anything. Maybe I didn't. Maybe I should have. I just stood there, like an idiot. Is that what you think? You think I'm a fucking idiot? No. No. When you pushed her, I just watched. When you punched her fucking face... I watched. I did not stop you. She's lying there and there's fucking blood everywhere. Why did you kill her? Fuck! Fuck! Shit. You can't do nothing. And you get that, right? What do you want to do? Ooh, ah! I want to let him know he's not welcome here. I don't even remember everything. I mean, it was so long ago. I remember it. I remember, all of it. I'll never forget it. I will never fucking forget how she looked lying on that road. Marvin. Marvin. Where are you going, man? Nothing. I'm just... I'm... I'm... Let's go have a drink, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Good music, good drinks. I'm telling you, it will be fun. All right. Good to see you guys. Well, look at you, man. You... You're a regular celebrity around here. I'm joking. Nobody here is over 21 years old, they don't know who you are. Now, do me a favor, take a drink with me. I got... I got you a vodka. I don't know if you've had vodka for 17 years. I could get you a Bailey's if... Wow. Brother, you're a truck. You know, uh, you know I was married. When? That was three years ago. Uh, and we had a kid. Yeah, I'm a dad. Where's the kid? Uh, she lives in Florida with her mom. She got full custody, you know. Uh, her name is Nina. Nina, like Simone. That must be tough. Yeah, it is. You know, uh... I try not to think about it. And I miss her all the time. Hey. Hey. What was that? The other day. The wheelchair. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Really? I go all the way out to your house to buy a wheelchair and you don't know what I'm talking about? I changed my mind. Why? No, just say it. Why? Because I don't have anything to give to people like you. There you are. You know, the last time I saw you, my grandmother's blood was splattered all over your shoes. You know, she was, uh, a cute grandma, but she used to fucking beat the shit out of me when I lived with her. She did, she took a fucking belt to the back of my... back of my neck. I... I wanted to kick her in... in the face myself. Sorry. I... I... I don't give a shit about sorry, Marvin. Now, you ain't going to do it. Are you just stand there like you got no mother-fucking balls, is that it? Your older brother, Karl, yeah, he was a fucking sissy, a fucking coward. Really? Marvin. What happened? They got him. What? Oh man, this... this is crazy. Now, look at you, you have a shotgun. They started it. They started it? Oh shit, man. Brother, you okay? Who did this? Fuentos. You know, I may be old, but I know my way around a shotgun. Okay, look, should we report this? Hell, no. We don't want any police around here. And especially with that shotgun. I'm on parole. I'm not even supposed to have this in the house. Maybe you should take a walk. What? No. It's nice outside, Momma, will you go for a walk with me? No. Your old high school used to be there. You were a good soccer player, we used to come every weekend. Remember that? Actually, I remember you were actually pretty good at soccer. Yeah. Are you ready? I'm ready. Okay, go! Oh, I missed. Come on, let's see. There you go. Oh, now you getting fancy. I am, yeah. You got it. Come on, come on, come on, come on, you can do it, - you can do it. - You've made me do it. Oh, Christ. Hey! Hey, Bernadette. Hey. Hi. Are you okay, Marvin, huh? What the hell happened to you? Well, we just wrestled a little. Well, that's bullshit. I mean, who did that? Come on, Bernadette. Who did it? Oh good, you are not going to tell me. Okay, fine. I can't believe they did that. Fuck... fuck! I mean, why am I... why am I talking about redemption and forgiveness. I talk every week about that shit. - Fucking morons. - It's all good, Father. You know what, I've known you guys for a long time. I dried a lot of Hacks family tears. Let it go, Bruce. What about you, Bernadette, huh? You didn't even open the door when I came by to check on you. And you don't even come to church anymore, why? It was too much. Okay? Okay. That's... that's fine... that's fine. It... it's just good that you got your boy back. Oh, God. Hey, Mrs. Hacks. How are you doing? Wade Lewis? You know, I'll see you later dude. Fuck. Hey, are you good? Better. I don't know. Hey, that girl with the green hair... with the green stripes. What's her deal? The Fuento girl? Fuento? Yeah. Delta, Russell Fuento's sister. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. I mean, I'm very messed up from here. What, are you like hot for her? She teaches some kind of workout class at the community center. It's kind of for old people. My aunt used to go. Who was that band we used to listen to here? Fuck the... the Donots. - Donots. - Donots, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. You saw that CD? CD? What are you talking about, brother? We ain't got fucking CD's no more. Fucking Bluetooth. Look. Great job today, guys. Drive safe. Hey, can you guys give me a ride? Yeah, sure. Why did you cut me down from the pole? That was you. What are you talking about? I know you were there. I could smell you. What more do you want from me? You already killed my grandma. And I'm sorry for that. - That's not enough. - Well, what is enough? - Fuck off. - No. - Just fuck off. - No. Look, what the fuck do you want from me? I want you to hit me. - I'm not gonna hit you. - No, I mean it. I want you to hit me. I deserve it. Last night wasn't enough. Go ahead and hit me. I'm not gonna hit you. Your brother probably does it all the time. Just get the fuck away from me, please. Please just leave. Why the fuck did you come back here? Cause this is my home, and I have nowhere else to go. You're not welcome here. Well, guess what? - I know that. - People like you don't- Yeah, people like me? What about you? You little skank. You're stealing drugs from the hospital? Slinging them to junkies? You're a real good fucking person. Marvin! Oh shit, Mom! Mom. It's okay. Call an ambulance. Thank you. I have to go. Thanks for coming. You know, I was just a little kid when my grandma died. A lot of it, I didn't understand. A lot of the... craziness, I- I don't remember it, but... I do remember her. Hey. - How's she doing? - I don't know. What's it like when your parents die? Um... I closed my dad's eyes when he, um, when he passed away five years ago. It was the hardest pain I've ever experienced. I mean, I've seen people die but... this time, it was my dad. My dad was... my dad was a guy everybody liked, right? Tall guy, strong as a bull. He was my high school football coach. Coach Johnson. Coach Johnson... I didn't think anything or anybody... could destroy him... but cancer did. It all happened so fast, you know. Within six months he was gone. Man, I cried... cried. I didn't even wanna leave my bed. Guess I wasn't done loving him. Your mother is... asleep now. She's stable. Call in a few hours. Okay. Thank you. You fucking bitch! Are you crazy? Would you like Mommy and Daddy to know you're hanging with the guy who killed our granny? I don't know where Mommy is because she's with the... she's with a fucking drug addict. And Daddy's in jail. That's fucking different. How is that different, Russell? Fuck you. The junkyard used to be over there. We used to come here after we bailed on class. Yeah, and the barn was there where those bleachers are. I used to bring girls back there. Oh, yeah. Like who? Like Crystal Goodwin? Oh, my God. I can't believe you remember her. Holy shit. Oh, wow. Fucking Crystal, man. Her tits were so big. That's where the barn was, right? All the way going down here. Remember when... You stole a pack of Menthols from the 7-Eleven? Oh, yeah. And then you couldn't find the lighter. So we had to go back to steal the lighter. Too stupid to even smoke. Then we had to go behind the barn, because we didn't want anyone to see us. There was so many fucking flies. Karl just lying there in his own blood, his eyes all glassy, the knife he cut his wrist with. God, the knife was so fucked up. So full of flies, and you just screamed your head off and your mom comes running out and they had to pin you down. God, that was fucking intense. - And then after... - Hey, shut the fuck up. I don't fucking feel anything anymore. Me neither. I don't feel a thing. See. How fucked up is a person who doesn't feel any pain? Like a zombie. Here is another, crackers with peanut butter. Oh, there it goes. What the fuck? I'd like to speak to Delta, please. You motherfucker. What are you doing on my street - at my sister's place? - Hey! Russell. I thought we cleared this up, motherfucker. - Get away from him. - Didn't we not clear this up? This is none of your business, Russell. Go inside and make sure Benny gets some real food, for fuck's sake. Mandy will be here in a minute. Come on. Watching you. Motherfucker. God, sometimes I feel like I'm the worst fucking mom on the planet. My brother's a total asshole, but he's... pretty good with Benny. What do you want? I need you to come with me. I... I need a witness. Please. I kinda have to be somewhere. Please. All right. What are we doing here? This is where I killed your grandmother 17 years ago. I don't really know what to say. I gotta go. If you want to come by my workout class, you... you can. Mom. Ah, there's my boyfriend. Bernadette, I can tell you're feeling better. We'll keep you here for a few more days and then send you home. It's okay, doc. I like you better than him anyway. The fluid that built up in her lung caused the infection. She's stable now, but... you have to prepare yourself. Try to enjoy the last days. Thank you, doctor. Hey. Hey. Is that the Hacks boy? Are you the Hacks boy? Yes, ma'am, I am. I'm also almost 40 now. So I guess that makes me a man. Trust fall. I've never seen hair like yours before. Is that real or, like, there's little add-on things? It's real. I like it. I'm a hair stylist. I cut people's hair and stuff. So, wait... have you never watched The Walking Dead? What about Game of Thrones? The Bachelor? No. Holy shit, dude. You missed out, big time. Hey would you... What? No, I was thinking maybe you could... you could do my mom's hair. You want more coffee, Mom? You know I was thinking maybe today, we could go to church. What do you think? After service, we can go get brunch. Mom? What do you think, going to get some brunch? Sounds good. I hope you're not gonna wear that. Hey. Is this a good time? I was headed to pick up Benny and I thought I could stop on the way. Er, and I brought the wheelchair. Oh. Thank you. Wow. Yeah. No, thanks. Come on in. Yeah. Mom, this is Delta. Morning. She brought you a wheelchair... and she's gonna do your hair. - Music? - Huh? Would you like music? Sure. What do you got? What do you like? I like country. Nice. Coming right up. Anti-gravity? Oh, yeah. It's for, um, like, volume for your hair. Just sit forward. Thank you. You've got nice hair. You normally color it? Oh, er, I haven't in a while, I probably should. I can only style today, but... We'll do it next time. I think an up-do would be nice. Well, there you go. Yeah, great. You look great. I know who you are. You are the Fuento's granddaughter. Heather and I were friends... before... It's all good, now. Wow! Mom... You look great. She looks great. Right? Can I invite you to brunch, after church? Please, let me. He's gonna be there. Sure. Yeah. I think it's fitting today that we read from the book of Matthew. Matthew teaches us the following about forgiveness. "For if you forgive other people" When they sin against us-. Who did that? Who fucking did that? Don't swear in church. If somebody attacks my son in church, I start swearing in church... No, no, stop. Are you serious, people? He's a killer. He should leave. - Why is he still here? - No, he's not welcome. Fuck that bitch. Do you want this killer here? No. Do you want this piece of shit to leave? He's a killer. He's a killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Killer. Stop! Stop it. What's wrong with you people? - He's the fucking problem! - Jesus Christ! We haven't even started mass yet. Animals. That's right, you heard me. That's what you are. That's what you fucking are, animals. He's an animal. Listen to this. Listen to this. "It is a sin not to forgive, Matthew 6:14," because unforgiveness can leave you unforgiven. He is not welcome in our community. That's right. Guess what? If you can't find humanity and forgiveness in your heart today, then I ask you, and everyone who feels that way... to leave. - Right now. - Is he serious? All assholes can leave this church right now. You know what, Father, fuck this shit. Then get out. All right, we're gone. Are you saying I should go back to where I came from? That's what I did. I came home. My mom is not doing too good. So I'm staying to take care of her. It's the right thing to do, you know. And... I want to do what's right. It's important to me that I can look my mom in the eyes and see that she doesn't hate me. Family, home. That's everything. When you mess up, people don't want to believe that you regret what you did. They don't want to... they don't want to hear you say that you're sorry and that you wish you could go back in time and change it. But I do. I do, I wish I could change it. Okay... Son... These are your people. All these people that stayed here, they stayed for a reason. And I ask you, as the community that you are... to support Marvin and his mother, Bernadette. And... that's it for today. That's all I had. It's hot, I'm going to take this off. Thank you, people. Thank you. So, how was church? It was... interesting. I definitely had some old farts checking me out. You guys look a bit holier. - Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. Have some of my pig. Oh, yeah. - Some. - Oh, you... you want this one? - No. - All right. Thank you. - Okay. - I'll be right back. She likes you. Promise me you'll take care of yourself. I promise. Can you use that to take a picture of my mom and I? Yeah. Come here, Mom. Oh, it's on selfie mode. Okay. Ready? Cute. So fast. Look at that. Today was a good day. Yeah. Very good. How are you doing? I'm okay. How are you doing? I don't know. The past weeks have been... a lot. A lot of good things too, though. Amen. I think I'm going to quit smoking tomorrow. Good. It's a good decision. Making a new day.
