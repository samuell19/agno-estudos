Oh, you'd be surprised at how many men think they're Rogers but they're really Jimmys. I know right? So where're you headed? Ah, to Rockwell, actually. It's where I'm from. Oh, that's so nice. Yeah, I think it's going to be nice. You know, it's funny... There's just... there's something about that place that I think I need right now. You know something I haven't felt since I was a kid. - Oh wait! That's when you did your first movie, right? - Yeah... - The puppy movie, right? - The puppy movie. Yes... I used to love that movie. Do you mind signing this. Sure, of course. All right. And your name is? - Sara. - Hi Sara. I used to love that movie. There is that brilliant line "The merry puppies..." No! "Happy Puppies"? No. "Have the puppiest Christmas ever!" Oh! You just said it! - Thank you! - Yeah, no problem. Thank you. Hi! - Merry Christmas, Alyssa! - Thanks so much. [Jake] Christmas film festival! - Sorry. - Excuse me. Here you go. Christmas film festival, right there. Launched the career of Alyssa Strader. See you there! Christmas film festival! [Mike] And... Rolling! This year is the twenty-fifth anniversary of "Holly's Puppy Christmas". Every Rockwellian's favorite holiday movie. It starred local talent Alyssa Strader, who went on to do the long-running hit TV show "Julie In Da House". [Erin] These days, you can find her on the big screen. But don't bother watching her latest effort, "Robo79 On Saturn". Will this be the year she finally returns to Rockwell for the annual film festival? So join us as we uncover Alyssa Strader's deepest secrets. And explore the town that put her on the road to her prime time success. Oh! Oh! [Erin] Are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Yup!

Well this year they are in for the surprise of their lives because I just bumped into Alyssa Strader. [Morty] They didn't have red carpets at the movie house when I was a kid. That was a very long time ago. And they don't call it the movie house anymore. Mom! Morty! Would you just please listen up! I just saw Alyssa Strader. Alyssa Strader is here? Yeah! Well, Merry Christmas! You've got to get her to come to the screening! I mean, you've been so worried about ticket sales, this could make a really big difference for the theater!

German art house film nights are not really bringing in the crowds. "Quiet Snow From Germany". Seriously, Mom? "Die Stille des Schnees" was highly regarded by the critics! Your mother feels it raises the cultural arts standards here in Rockwell. Yeah. - Sure. For the seven people who show up. We're floundering, okay. But this 25th year anniversary screening could be the event that shines a spotlight on this theater and finally brings in business. Your optimism is wonderful, Jake. Morty, how come you don't have the same optimistic outlook? By the time we met, that optimism had turned into a cynicism. [CHUCKLES] Well I still love you! You old cynical cinema buff! Hey, hey, hey! No PDAs in front of the kid. Oh, I think after nine years, Jake knows that we're going out. Now listen, you keep decorating... And you convince Alyssa to come to the screening. You know her, right? Ah... It's been a long time, Mom. I mean, she's hasn't been back in, like, 25 years. Where's that eternal optimism now? All right, I'll see what I can do.

No, but we should have one for the Christmas Film Festival. Good, because we're here for the 25th Anniversary of "Holly's Puppy Christmas". Yeah, we're doing a documentary on Alyssa Strader. That's great! You should actually interview Jake there. He was an elf in the film. Not the elf that brought Holly the magic ticket? No. No, I was Elf Number Seven. The one in the North Pole. - Oh. That's pretty cool. Yeah, maybe if he was Elf Number Five. Elf Number Five was my favorite. Tiny. And cute. Fair enough. Shouldn't we still interview him? - No. - Guys, umm... Do you plan on interviewing the leads? Obviously. - Seriously bro? Alyssa Strader's people are so difficult to deal with. - Credit card. - Oh yeah... [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Just a second. Feeling a little chill m'lady? So you're the butler then? No. I was dropping some complimentary tickets off at the front desk when you called down. And well, Oliver had no one to send up so I volunteered myself. That must be my Mom that called. I've never made an actual real fire before, and I thought it's probably not a good idea for me to burn the place down. Well you've come to the right place. Here, it's easy. See, Oliver makes sure there's a pre-built fire for the guests so all you have to do is open the flue and then light a match. Okay. Uh, where do I light it? - Just over here. Try to catch the paper in the center here. - Okay. Just right here? - Uh huh. Yeah, just underneath is good. [Alyssa] Oh! There we go. [Jake] Ah! Perfect. There we are. Do you do your own stunts? I wanted to thank you for the save earlier today in the lobby. No problem. So what are you doing back here in Rockwell? I feel like I haven't had a real Christmas since I left here. And, why'd your family move to LA? I mean, you could of gone back and forth between here and there. That got real personal real fast. Oh, I'm sorry. I tend to blurt. - It's okay. My Mom just thought it was going to be the best move for my career at the time. - Ah... But sometimes I feel like, I feel like it was a bit of her dreams that took us down there, you know?

The original Ruby Ticket to the movie. Good for one trip to the North Pole and back home. Was it donated, Mom, or did Morty print it out on his new laser printer? Morty donated it, so I guess a little of both. [LAUGHS] Jake, I know how much this theater means to you. It's our family's cinema, not just mine. Yes, and I love that you still have a passion. Your father had the same passion for this place. But I was thinking about what you said to me the other day. That maybe my love of art films is setting this business up to fail. Maybe I need to go see cinema in the countries where these greats came from. I can take care of things around here, Mom. You can travel more for sure. Well, we have had some very generous offers for the building. Maybe it is time to let it live a new life. No. No, this, is our family's legacy. And I think Alyssa Strader coming back is a sign. Sounds like that schoolboy crush is waking up. I haven't forgotten those posters you had before college. Oh, okay. [LAUGHS] It is great to see Alyssa after all these years. But, it's also made me realize how wonderful it is to live in Rockwell. I always thought Alyssa outgrew this town. We were poorer for it. But maybe she missed us just as much as we missed her.

Although after the way we treated her... I wouldn't blame her if she did. - Hey! - Hey. Alyssa. Are you okay? Ah... It's been a rough 24 hours. I need tea. And I need to apologize to you. Hold on. I'm closing early. No, no, no. Don't close for me. They can make tea at home. It's only boiled water. It's all domestic bliss when it's cookie time but you should see the state my laundry room is in at home. Well, that sounds like heaven to me right about now! [NATALIE CHUCKLES] It must of been hard for my Mom to raise me alone in this town. I remember when she worked here for my Mom. And she actually pitched you to the director of "Holly's Puppy Christmas" right there. [younger Jenny] Thank you. Thanks. Now don't mind me. Are you okay? That's an awful lot of sugar for one afternoon. Ah, truth be told, I'm looking to drown my sorrows in these bad boys later. Hey, I'm Shirley Madison. Jenny Strader. Pleased to meet you. You too. Yeah, well, I'm in town directing a little movie and it turns out my lead girl is a little bit of a diva so if I don't find a new Holly soon the studio's going to shut me down. Quick. Well, my little girl can act. [Shirley] Yeah. Like all kids can act, right? No. She's been taking classes. She even went away to sleep-away acting camp. Hmmm... How old is she? Twelve. She's right there behind the counter. Honey... Umm... This is Miss Madison. Tell her about your acting. Hi Miss Madison. My name's Alyssa Strader. I want to be an actress when I grow up. Oh yeah, Miss Strader. And what if you can't be an actress? Then I'll be an actor. Know what kid? I'm going to give you a shot at a screen test tomorrow. How does that sound? Does she have an agent? Umm... Just me. [Natalie] You got your first part through that audition. And that role changed your life. Natalie, I talked to my Mom. She never told me that you called after we left. She said she was too busy managing my career. You were busy filming your show. It happens. Yeah but it wasn't my Mom's call to make. Moving to LA was more her dream than mine. I would have loved to have heard from you. You're one of the few people in this world that I consider a real friend. Of course I'm your friend. We had fun together. That's what I mean. You had no ulterior motives. You liked me for me. I'm so sorry that I let my fame take me away from our friendship. Apology accepted. Okay, so are you in Rockwell for the big anniversary of our movie? Or maybe working on a character? Escaping a love affair? I just miss my old life. I've spent so many Christmases without snow or lighting the tree in the town square. Plus I'm always on display in Hollywood. You probably can't even go on a date without hearing people's comments. Actually it's the same in this small town. Although Vera at the bank doesn't get thousands of views. [THEY BOTH LAUGH] Why did you give up acting? You were studying theater. I like local. I do community theater for fun. But I like the balance I have with Jones and the kids. You know what you want. You're smart to stick with what you know. I on the other hand am not exactly transitioning smoothly from TV to film. "Robo79! Put down the laser and walk away." Clearly you've seen my big screen flop. Uh... It's not bad. It's just interesting. - Ah, interesting... [LAUGHTER] Okay. It's bad! - It's bad! [LAUGHTER] I'm glad you're back. Me too. [Jake] Because it's the 25th anniversary of the movie that launched Alyssa Strader. I can't say. Yeah, I understand that she's in town. Yeah, hang on. Yes I am aware she's here. Yes she has been to the theater. Yeah, thanks for waiting. Hello? And how's the press junket coming along? It's not coming along at all. You know, this is our chance to turn the theater around. So is Alyssa coming? I mean, she's in town and everyone knows it anyway. I don't know. Well why don't you ask her? Yeah, I'm sure she'd appreciate that even though she didn't want to be recognized here. She just didn't want to be hounded by the press. She wanted her own peaceful Christmas, the exact opposite of putting her face out there in the media and doing publicity for us. Well, I follow that logic. [Jake] Hey! I've been trying to get a hold of you but it keeps going to your voicemail. Which is full by the way. Jake. Someone told the media I was here. And you think it was me? Well, I'm hoping it wasn't. Whatever you think, I would never do that to a friend. Friend? I know the theater isn't doing well, and this will bring a lot of attention to your festival. I get it but I just thought I could trust you. You can trust me. Well, you could've fooled me. Good bye Jakey. Alyssa! Alyssa? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Erin] Of course we've seen her. She's been here since we got here. We just didn't wanna make a fuss about it. We're waiting to do our exclusive interview for our ground-breaking documentary "Holly's Puppy Christmas: The Social Impact". But you know how these TV stars are like. Yeah they're all like, look at me! look at me! and then you look at them, and they're like, what are you looking at? And here's a restraining order. By the way, that last part's off the record. Way off the record. Seriously. Okay? Erin? [Alyssa] Mom it's awful. All I wanted was a normal Christmas, with snow and fa la las. And now it's crazy. [Jenny] Alyssa, that's what I have been telling you. You do not have a normal life! Have you been on your social media? You are blowing up right now. Is that all you can say? I finally connected with a real human being who might actually like me for who I am. You are trending. And you didn't even have to do anything! - What?

Well she thinks I told the press. Which, of course, I would never do. [Juniper] No. Chocolate, anyone? [Jake] Look, just a few of us knew she was here. Mom, Oliver, me and you, Morty. Well, I didn't tell anyone. [Morty] Not really. Not really? I posted it on the town site. I'm sorry, Alyssa. I was excited to see you. I'm a fan. I've seen all your movies. I just opened my mouth and it came out. [Morty] I didn't realize it would ruin your Christmas. I appreciate that Morty. If there's anything I can do to make it up to you. Well I kind of hate that I haven't done number one A on my Christmas list. One A? It's tied with ice skating as most important. Morty... Get the suit. Smile! Oh! My battery died. I'll go get mine. I'll be right back. Okay. Thank you, Morty. I was up later than usual. I was tired. I should've been getting ready for bed. Instead, I was online making poor decisions. Let me guess. Your fingers hit the keyboard and out it came. [CHUCKLES] Pretty close. I really thought it would bring more business to the theater. We've caused Jake too much stress. Not everyone likes German Art films you know. I didn't think it would cause so much upset. I know, it's hard for people to understand when it hasn't happened to them personally. Wait a second. What time did you do that post? 10:30ish... 10:15 maybe. So that was after the news broke. So it was Jake? You know, I can't do this. I have to go. Thank you for doing the one A Santa suit thing. Alyssa... Go easy on Jake, will you? It's not as easy as that, Morty. We've just proven that I have a very different life. And not an easy one. Easier with him, maybe. Alyssa! Alyssa! Please wait! Clearly I've been living in a fantasy the last few days, thinking that I could actually live like a regular person here. All I wanted was a proper, real life Christmas. You deserve a real life Christmas. But, to be honest, secretly I was a little relieved when the news got out. But this theater, it means everything to me. And it's suffering, but there's more than that... Because everyone sees me as a means to an end, Jake. But I'm a person too, struggling to make connections. Struggling to find my true self. I'm more than just a character on a screen. But how can you ever see your self as more than that if you just keep on hiding? Easy for you to say. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Jenny] I thought you might want to.

Personally, I think you're more popular now than you were in the middle of your series. [Jenny] I had a feeling this Rockwell connection would go well. - Wait what? You were against me coming to Rockwell the entire time. No I just meant that when you stopped hiding you would see that you could never go home again. Mom. Did you tell the media I was here? Because the timing with Morty doesn't quite work out. Who's Morty? [Alyssa] And now that I think about it, Jake was busy on the mic when it all went down. So that means that someone else would've had to told the media. Anyone could have spotted you at that trivia night. The whole town was there. I was dressed as an actual Santa. And that must have been adorable. I think we should lean into this Christmas angle. [Jenny] Put the suit on again for a photo shoot, okay? Mom... I am going to ask you this one more time. Did you tell the media that I was here in Rockwell? I had to make you to see. I had to make you remember that Rockwell is not your home.

And I thought if I came back to the place where it all started, I could get that. So, all you want for Christmas is a time machine? No, all I want for Christmas... Is Christmas. Alyssa...

But I think you'll see not everything in Rockwell has stayed the same as you remember. - Really? - Uh huh. But ten years ago, the town decided to start a new tradition. Instead of people leaving wishes asking for presents, animals in need get to make their wish for a forever home. Now visitors to the tree can enjoy Christmas by giving as well as receiving. [Alyssa] Well, it's beautiful. I want to thank you for bringing me here today. I think I was so focused on returning to the town of my childhood that I forgot while I was busy growing up, Rockwell was too. For sure.

Even when I was a kid, I was twelve years old, and I forgot all my lines... You were there for me. Truthfully, I've had a crush on you since we were twelve.
