- Wait! Whoa! - That hurts! This reeks! You okay? Can you get up? You guys have it good. I mean, I've got nothing. Nothing at all. You're all leaving me behind. You're crazy. Come on. Get up. Leave me be! Why not just leave me here? I'll go to the dump with the rest of this trash! That's right. Eighty percent of the people in this world are trash, aren't they? What about the other 20%? They're scum. That's so cruel! You're the one who said it. I think that there is at least 1% who is all right. Those people aren't all right. They're just oblivious to reality! Fine! All right! Okay... Let's go home. Come on. You jerk! I'll get you for that! Watch out! I'M 46 AND I'VE ENDED UP BEING A BORING ADULT Come here! Everyone else keeps growing older, but we stay the same. It's not where you go, but who you go with. You'll be just fine. You're interesting. Your body is filled too, with words waiting to go to heaven. That seems so ordinary. On the last day of 1999, when we went our separate ways, she said, "I'll bring the CDs next time." Those were our last words. Then it was over between us. YEAR 2015 TOKYO WAS LIKE THE SINKING TITANIC Let's Have Fun Show! WITH LOVE AND APPRECIATION FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS SUPPORTED US THESE 30 YEARS! LET'S MEET AGAIN SOMETIME! - Mr. Oguro! - Mr. Oguro! Mr. Oguro! - Mr. Oguro! - Don't go! Mr. Oguro! Everyone, today, - let's have fun! - Fun! You know, I'd really like to thank you for helping us keep this up for so long. Thank you too! To be honest, it just doesn't feel like the show has ended. I mean, I'm not really sure what I should do with my free time now. In fact, I just might come back to the TV studio. Don't you dare! I'm Sanai. Keiichiro Sanai. - Thank you. - Nice meeting you. - I'm Sanai. Keiichiro Sanai. - No, it's... I started a temp agency. I'll do whatever's needed, even sponsor a show. Wow... You really did, you know... become pretty ordinary. I've made a fresh start. I can see that. I'll start over as many times as it takes. So let's enjoy ourselves! - Let's have fun! - Fun! Please. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you so much, Mr. Oguro! - Thank you so much for all you've done. - Thank you! It's Director Hosoi with the Let's Have Fun Show! Girls doing "Koi Suru Fortune Cookie." Everyone, dance! THANK YOU, LET'S HAVE FUN SHOW! THANK YOU FOR 30 YEARS! Mr. Hosoi! Hosoi, your dancing sucks! Don't get so depressed. Have fun. Yay! Hey. Don't drink too much tonight. I'll be fine. Yay is coming one more time! Did you see Sekiguchi? Is he here? He was involved in this show too. - He's here, right? - Let's have more fun! Actually, he just left. - Really? - Yeah. Here's where it gets good! - That's so cute! - Here comes the chorus! All together now, everyone! SEKIGUCHI: A PARTY, HUH? I'M NOT SURE. IF I CAN, I'LL SHOW. Spinning around! DID YOU COME? YOU SHOULD JUST QUIT. Please come up, Mr. Onda. - I'm sorry! - Sorry. Thank you. You were dancing earlier. I made a ton of mistakes. Nobody's watching anyway. Yeah, you're probably right. But it means a lot more than anything that I've done. I work for the company that made the graphics for this show. No matter how good they are, it's not like anyone will ever remember them. I know how you feel. I totally understand. You do? Do you recognize my face? I've made six DVDs. Is that right? Do you want to get out of here? There's no point in this. It's like a funeral. Right? Wow! This place is huge! It's Tokyo Tower. What? I like Tokyo Tower more than Skytree. It's sexy. I'll post it on my blog. You think it's sexy? It went out. What? What's wrong? When... you were a kid... did you want to be like you are now? What? I'm not really sure. I... I sure didn't. SEKIGUCHI: QUIT THAT JOB AND COME WORK FOR ME 4 LEVELS OF ONLINE LESSONS FOR ALL TYPES OF CHILDREN THERE'S NO NEED FOR CLASSROOMS ANYMORE. KENTA SEKIGUCHI FRIEND REQUESTS KAORI OZAWA (KATO) FROM THE SECOND RECEPTION. HERE ARE SOME PHOTOS EVERYONE SENT! She really has... become ordinary. Thank you. The heavy rain will move to eastern Japan, so please be very careful. Oh, you're here. I texted you that I'd come. You did? I'm taking those with me. Some of mine are still here. I think this one's mine. Did you ever intend to marry me? I guess it was all lies then. What was? Give me back all those years! You know that's impossible. Wait! I hope you stay cooped up here forever! The rain's really heavy. Take an umbrella. YEAR 2011 I WAS SWAMPED WITH WORK PROBABLY DUE TO THE EARTHQUAKE AFTERSHOCKS Yamamoto! How many hours is that job going to take you? - Hey, you guys. - Yes? Both of these are due today at 5 p.m. They'd better not be late. - Okay. - Okay. You're taking forever on that, Taniguchi. This takes a long time, man. I can't help it. This place is way bigger, isn't it? Why the heck are we moving at a time like this? Yeah, the timing totally sucks. Hey, don't you have to be somewhere now, Mr. Sato? Oh, shit. Would you like to eat first? I'm sorry. He should be here soon. That's all right. Sorry. Why are you dressed like that? I'm sorry that I'm late. Here you are. Okay, we'll eat now. Certainly. Things are really busy at the office right now. That's all right. I mean, being busy at work is a good thing. Well, none of the work pays very well though. But there is a lot of it. So making a living isn't a problem. Yes. Sounds like hard work. Well, I guess you could call it hard. Though we work on material about the earthquake or Fukushima, we also have to do graphics for trashy shows. It kind of drives you a little crazy. - I see... - But, that's what the world is like. I guess we just have to accept it. Right. Anyway, that's the kind of work I do. What are you talking about? Sorry. Excuse me for a second. Hello? Yes? I see... No problem at all. I'll do it right now. Okay. Got it. Bye. Later. I really am sorry. - So... - A 45-year-old shut-in killed his parents. I need to make a reenactment. - Hey. - What? What was that earlier? "That's the way the world is, so we just have to accept it." Sorry. I have to go right away. Will you be like this after we marry? No, I mean, we're seriously busy right now. We can't get married right this minute. So you're just going to put it off. Well, I mean... you know how a lot more people are getting married after the earthquake. So? What about it? Well, it's kind of... It's just... so ordinary, right? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. All right. Your mom's here until tomorrow, right? Forget it. If you're like this, even if you met my dad, it'll go bad. - Fine. Okay... - What? Let's have lunch again tomorrow, the three of us. I'll get reservations somewhere. I really am sorry about today. I'll wear a proper suit and everything, yes. So wipe everything that happened today from your memory. - That's... - Just delete it. - You know I can't do that. - I swear, tomorrow, I'll do it right. Fine. - I swear I'll do it right tomorrow. - Yeah, sure. I swear I'll do it right. Sorry. Nice. Give me a smile. There. Here goes. YEAR 2008 THE GREATEST NUMBER OF LIGHTNING STRIKES EVER RECORDED IN TOKYO It really makes me laugh when I remember it. But it worked out in the end. - Really? - Mr. Oguro liked it. - Really? - Yes, it's fine. - I'm glad to hear it. - Hang in there. - Thank you. - Sure. See you. This is the bill for last time. Tell your boss to reduce it by 30%. Mr. Onda. Yeah? Hey! Stop! Hey! Cut that out! Stop it! Mr. Sato. Mr. Sato! Check this, please. Here goes. What the heck is this? That's not what they asked for. But this is more interesting. Forget about that. Just make it ordinary. That's insane. Mr. Sekiguchi told me I should find something that I can enjoy at this job. Forget about that stuff. The youth just stare at their phones, not the TV. We need to make this stuff for housewives and old people. Your sophisticated ideas don't click with them. Do it over! I'm back. Sekiguchi, get over here! What the hell is your problem, man? Do you realize what you've done? Yes, I do. Who do you think gives us work, huh? You want to go back to doing that shitty cheap-ass work we used to do? It's no different now. What did you say, you son of a bitch? What happened to you lately? You're losing it. I am not losing it. I know you wanted to do the same thing. Yeah, I did, but... I'm quitting this job. You've said that for years. I've got a kid on the way. With who? - With my girlfriend. - Yeah, but which one? Well, let me see... Remember that company president who got arrested? Oh, yeah... From something-or-other corporation. Remember that party that big-spending president DJed? She's the girl I picked up there. You were dating her? I wasn't really dating her. It was kind of off and on. So we're getting married. You go and do what you want to do. You were writing a novel, right? Start writing again. Or was it acting? If I could write novels, I wouldn't be here. Who cares what it is? Just get the heck out of here. PARTWAY UP THE HILL IN MARUYAMACHO, SHIBUYA, THERE'S A LOVE HOTEL NEAR SHINSEN. THEY HAVE A ROOM THAT'S WALLPAPERED TO LOOK LIKE OUTER SPACE. AT THAT TIME, FOR THE TWO OF US, IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE WE FELT SAFE. I LOVED MY GIRLFRIEND MORE THAN MYSELF AND... YOU'LL BE JUST FINE. YOU'RE INTERESTING. No, I'm not. I've got nothing. YEAR 2000 Hey, Sato! How long are you going to sleep? THERE WAS NO TECH REVOLUTION FOR ME. You're going to the 15th-anniversary party, right? Let's go together! I sure as heck don't want to go alone! I've had it with this! There's a ton of cute chicks! - Do you want to appear on my TV show? - I'd love to! - What do you want to do? - I want to go... - Do you want to... - I want to dance. I want to sing. I want to eat sweets. I'm always giving you trouble, so today I'm paying for the VIP room. - Thanks, man! - Rent for a year in a two-bedroom condo, moving expenses, and a full set of furniture! Congratulations! This way. Are you having fun? - How's it going? - What do you think it is? Chakin sushi! You got some stuff today? You sure like it, don't you? And it's not just cheap old sushi! Instead of ginger garnish, you each get 10,000 yen! Huh? What's this stuff? Red balls. Want to do it? This'll blow you away. How much? - It's on the house today. - Thanks, man. Now, the president of the show's main sponsor, Nakama Corporation, President Sanai! Sanai! This time, he'll be DJing the party! He's on fire tonight. He's DJing? Seriously? He's DJing? And he's playing Denki Groove! What? You listen to Denki Groove, Mr. Sekiguchi? - I totally dig "Niji"! - Seriously? I'm totally going home with some ass tonight! Hey Sato! Sato! You take one too! Here you are. A bottle of champagne. - Certainly. - Your most expensive stuff. - With three glasses. - Certainly. Actually, I'd like a gin tonic. Certainly. - I'm feeling it. Hold on, it's too bright. - What? That disco mirror ball is super beautiful. Hey, you ladies, hurry up and sit next to the men! Darn you! Come on! You can take these chicks home with you. - We can? - But you have to get their approval. Forcing them is against the law. Forcing them is against the law. But even that's okay, right? - Yay! - You're so cute! This is the time to let loose! - That's right! - Who knows what tomorrow will bring? "Today is the last day of my life." Live life like that every day. Just kidding! - Nozomi! - My name's Mayu. - I was shocked! - Will you do it with me tonight? - What? Tonight? - Answer me in five seconds. - Five, four, three, two, one... - Actually, I think that'd be fun! - Seriously? - Seriously! You're fine, man. You're interesting. Understand? Say... I've got a knack for finding people in despair. She told him, "I've got a knack for finding people in despair." In despair! Then what did you say? "At last, I've found you." - I didn't say that! - Wow! You're kidding! That's something that Hitonari Tsuji would say. - Totally! - I told you, I didn't say that! I bet you totally thought about it though. You still haven't gotten over getting dumped by your girl, right? Girl? You mean that pen pal? You got a girl by being pen pals? Don't bring that up, would you? Hey, I know! Let's invite that Soo here! - Yeah! - What? Why? Only a woman can heal the wounds left by a woman. It's not a wound, Nana. He's got a hole in his heart. - Isn't that right? - A hole is a hole! Call her right now! She's probably sleeping. - Hurry up and call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Call her! - Fine! - Call her! - I'll do it! Stop it! Cut that out, would you? Cut it out! Come on, now! Welcome! - There you are. - That was fast. - You live nearby? - Just over there. You live in Shinjuku, girl? I'm so envious! - Please have a seat. - Move down for her. - At last, I've found you! - Shut up! - Cut it out! - Sit down! Ignore those idiots. What are you drinking? A green tea highball. Green tea highball. Coming up! Here's to Soo. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Get out of the way! - How come? - Nice to meet you. - Get in there. - Clink glasses. - Oh, you too! You know, you've got a really pretty face, girl. No. You could be a model. Well, I do some acting. Really? Are you an actress? Well, I do all kinds of stuff. You used to act, Nanase, right? Shut up about that! That's my dark past! I used to play in the J.League. - Really? Wow! - But it was J2 though. Don't talk about that. Hey, Soo. You're half Japanese, aren't you? I'm a mixture of a lot of things. - Really? - Is that right? I can be whatever you want me to be. What languages can you speak? - Well, English and Korean. - Okay. - I'm studying Chinese now. - Say something in Korean. What did you say? You understand? I bet you insulted me! - What did she say? - Den, what did she say? She complimented him, right? You said, "It's so wonderful how tall you are." Right, Soo? - She did not say that! - She complimented you. - Yes! - Yay! - You're great, Soo! - Awesome! Sato, sing the second half! - No way! - Sing a duet! Sing with her! - Go! - No way! No! Excuse me. There you go. Now, you, cut that out! You handled that well. - Hey, get us some tequila. - Certainly. It's okay. For this, you say the magic word, "Soo," and just do it. Over and over, you say it! When's that thing due? I think it said Wednesday in the email. What day is it today? - I've got no idea of the day. - True. - You think we'll even finish in time? - What? Yeah, we can. Sato! Soo's got the day off tomorrow. You do too, right? Yeah. You've got tomorrow off? Want to go somewhere? Yeah, but I've got to look for a place tomorrow. I want to move. Then how about this, Soo? I'm running this event. Come to it. Why would she go to something where people eat insects? Why not? No... No way. That's disgusting. Okay, then let's drink until morning, then we'll go fishing. - I like it. Awesome. - You want to go fishing? That's so ordinary. What's wrong with that? Ordinary is the best. - That's right. - Yeah. Sato, you're losing her. I told you, I've got to look at places tomorrow. - Quit being a killjoy. - I'm not a killjoy! Don't be a killjoy! - How come? - Killjoys are trash. What about you, Nana? Me? Of course, I'm trash. Eighty percent of people in the world are trash. What about the other 20%? Scum! - We're trash-scum! - Trash or scum, huh? You should walk Soo home. I can't. You know we're on call right now. If big news breaks, we have to go back fast. - Right, Sekiguchi? - I'm a J.Leaguer, man. You still haven't gotten over your last girlfriend? I thought you said she was ugly. No, I told you before. She only said that to be modest. What did you think of her when you first met? "I'm glad she's not uglier than I was expecting." That's pretty damn cruel. Go on, walk her home. Go on. Watch out! - I'm fine. - No, you're not fine. I told you. I'm fine. Let's go to one more place. Okay, from here on, you can only step on white. - Where's the white? - Those little ones. - Those tiny ones? - Yeah. You can only step on those from now on. Here we go! You stepping on them? Yeah. If you step on anything other than white, you buy the beer. - Okay? - We're not drinking again, are we? Sorry! Thanks. Excuse me for a sec. Okay. Hello? Okay. All right. Sorry. I've got work. Oh, okay. Bartending? Actually... this place... is rented for me by Sanai. This is where I do my work. What kind of work? I do it... with customers here. When I'm done, I'll give you a call. You really stayed! I have nothing. You know, living like this... really isn't all that bad. ...several restaurants and bars. The group of companies hid a total of several billion yen in income. I want to contribute to society. Sato! - I'm creating places - Have a look at this. where people can connect. The suspect, Mr. Sanai, ran several businesses, such as elderly care facilities and restaurants. One of them was a massage service for men run out of this condominium. Uh-oh. That was stupid. ...women conducted sexual acts. I guess Sanai's done for. ...they were forced into prostitution in exchange for rent and living expenses. The number you have dialed is no longer in service. Make sure you have dialed the number correctly and try again. The number you have dialed is no longer in service. YEAR 1999 NEW YEAR'S EVE THE GREAT PROPHECY WAS WRONG AND THE WORLD DIDN'T END, BUT... THE YEAR 2000 IS HERE! This kind of shit is so lame. They don't need to make such a big deal out of it. What does it matter if they do? Yeah, I guess you're right. Say... Next year... I mean, this year... Why don't we live together? What? I'll even meet your parents. How about it? Well... I don't know... That seems so ordinary. Yeah, I guess it is. It sure is cold. Yeah. Okay, I'm going this way. Not to the station? There's somewhere I need to go. I'll bring the CDs next time. YEAR 1998 JAPAN'S WORLD CUP SOCCER TEAM LOST ALL THREE OF ITS GROUP STAGE GAMES. COME VISIT ME HERE! The next time we meet will be next year. When I get to India, I'll send you a postcard. Take care. Bye. MAHJONG Boss. We'll never finish in time. Have a little pride in your work! Dammit! Just do this! Tilt the exclamation point! Don't just italicize it! Rotate it! Okay. See? How's that? That's way better, isn't it? Yes. Now hurry it up! ...injuring four people. - The mobster who fired the shots - Hello? Yes. Thank you very much. - tried to get away, - We were just watching it. - but was shot and killed in the parlor. - That's right. Reenactment graphics, right? Okay, we'll do it. Okay. We'll rush it. Thank you. - Goodbye. - I'm back. Who said you could go shopping for clothes after making a delivery? We got an order for reenactment graphics for this! DEAD: GANG MEMBER, KAIBARA-KAI TORU MIYAJIMA (29) - I still can't go home? - What are you still doing here? Get out of here now! Right! Time is short for this! Get a move on! - Mr. Sato! Up here! - Oh, Mr. Hosoi. Hurry up! - Sorry it's always so rushed. - It's okay. Sorry! The graphics are here! You're late! What's your fucking problem? We wanted it to be easy to read... Nobody looks at that damn shit! Take 30% off the bill. - The boss says he can't reduce it... - Fine! Then fuck off! Hurry up! It's finally here! How much longer? It's going to start! Get your ass in gear, motherfucker! - In thirty seconds. - Thirty seconds? Okay. Oh, you're still here? A hostess club again? No, it was a business meeting. It's for work. - Good night. - Hey. Give me a smoke. Take tomorrow off and go somewhere with your girlfriend. She's in India right now purchasing stuff for the shop. Oh, right. You mentioned that. Get married, would you? I'll make sure you can earn enough. Actually... she kind of thinks that sort of stuff is stupid. What sort of stuff? Marriage? That kind of... ordinary stuff. I get it now. She's that kind of girl. Okay. Let's get ramen or something. Treat me to something better than that. How about a beef bowl? Yeah, I guess so. YEAR 1997 I RODE THE GALACTIC RAILROAD FROM TOKYO. Boss, you're accepting way too many cheap jobs. Want one, Sekiguchi? Can't go home tonight either. - Sato. - Yeah? Your pager is going off. CALL ME. KAORI. Good morning. Were you drinking until morning? I couldn't sleep. I called because I wanted to goof off together today. What? You want to go somewhere? I haven't decided yet and won't. That makes no sense. We'll rent a car, take the highway, get off when we want to, and eat when we want to. Maybe even go to a hot spring. Would you like that? What? Yeah, but I can't just suddenly ask for the day off today. I've already rented a car. What? I'll still go alone even if you can't come. But you know how darn shorthanded we are. We've got a ton of orders again today. Oh, I get it. You really are ordinary. The world's going to end in two years anyway. You go on. You can pay next time at the hostess club. It'll be just fine. I just have to do what they asked. I can do it alone. Hello? This is Great International. Good afternoon! Right. The urgent one? It doesn't look like it has arrived. You can send it again, but we're really busy today. It'll probably take twice the time. We'll send it when it's done. I got this. Right. Okay. - One hostess club night. - You pay, man. Okay. You already sent it twice? You know, the fax has been on the fritz lately. Dang! What a crystal-clear day! The perfect weather for a drive. Okay! Now it's time to listen to our next request. - From Oita, nickname... - Which way do you want to go? - Which way? - Left! We barely made that! That was close. And who's this? Scha Dara Parr! - Wrong! - What? The song is Ryoko Hirose's "I Seriously Love..." Inu-cara! Does it hurt today? No. Then it'll be sunny. I wish I could quit this job and run off somewhere. How come? You want to go far away? Well, I mean, if I went abroad somewhere and got some inspiration, I think it would change my life. Kenji Miyazawa... His whole life, he never went anywhere far away. He spent most of his life in the Tohoku countryside but traveled to the Milky Way. Pretty darn crazy, don't you think? Yeah, that's crazy. It's not where you go, but who you go with. Did you take a photo of me? Come here! Come here! You hungry? - We just ate. - No, we didn't. Yes, we did! EL-MALO has some good stuff lately. You listen to EL-MALO? They're cool. Yeah, they are. I listen to a lot of old stuff lately, like Zeppelin and stuff. - Hello. - Oh, welcome! My parents sent these. Please have them. Oh, my goodness! - Where are you from again? - Gunma. Oh, Asian pears! I love these! - Oh, no! - There's no way! - We'll never get a seat! - Yes, we might. Standing room only for the... - Oh, no! - See, I told you! Is this supposed to be like Long Vacation? Let's have sex. - Thanks for waiting. - No problem. What's that shirt? A Paul Smith? Yeah. I thought it was nice. Over there. You paid all that money to buy something everyone wears. Look at this. These clothes, they came from a faraway country and made their way to me here. It's like how Japanese trains are way over in Buenos Aires. Nice, don't you think? Yes, I do. Listen carefully. There'll be a test later. You're going to look? No, I won't. You've memorized all of them? Yes, I have. For music, it needs to be current stuff. Here. This one's better. You're right. Here. I'll put this back. That has a funny smell. Want to try it? It has a sweet taste. That stuff's bad for you. Why are you saying that? Everyone dies anyway. - Hurry it up! You're so useless! - I'm hurrying! - You finished the check? - Just about done. - Hurry it up! - I am. They'll stop giving us work, you guys! YEAR 1996 GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO BELIEVE IN GOD. You okay? I'm sorry. Okay. Miyajima! What are you doing? Get a move on! Sorry! I'll be there in a sec! Here. Hey, mister. You should see a doctor. But I've got to deliver these. Here. Miyajima! Don't keep the boss waiting! I know! Does it hurt? That'll do for a while. Be careful! Sorry! I wonder if I'll do this job my whole life. It scares me sometimes. I read Ramo Nakajima's novel the other day. Ramo Nakajima? Yeah. The main character... His job is to type other people's manuscripts into a computer every single day. Sounds like you, right? For years, he typed in the manuscripts all alone. He simply types in things totally unrelated to his own thoughts. Then one day, under the influence of drugs, the main character sits at the computer, but he falls asleep. Then when he wakes up in the morning, he finds that he has written a complete novel. He wrote a novel while unconscious? That's insane. Yeah, pretty insane. His body was filled with all the words of other people he'd typed. They had never gone to heaven. Like the ghosts of words. Your body is filled too, with words waiting to go to heaven. I'm sure of it. You think so? Why not try writing a novel? I've got nothing to write. You'll be just fine. You're interesting. YEAR 1995 REACH OUT OF THE DARKNESS - Your acting was really good. - Thank you! The snacks you brought were good. - It was moving. - Bring those again. - Come next time, okay? - Yeah, I'll be there. Yeah, let's go. Come next time, Sato. It's really interesting. No thanks. Theater bores me. How come? There's a big audience, so it gets really exciting! No, it doesn't. Yes, it does. Doesn't it? How come you won't go? Here. Have this. Isn't Nanase pretty? REINI - AWAKENED LADIES That's me. - Wow! - He's totally charming! - He's really pretty! - Yeah, don't you agree? - You call that pretty? - Come just once! - No way. - Come! No. Darn that nincompoop! I'll really quit if that happens again! How long have you been working here? Since I was 22. Really? How old are you now? Buzz off! You'll have one too, right? You sure do love that! - It's the best. - Totally. I'll have it that way even when I'm rich. Let's see... "I'm looking for a pen pal who's a fan of Cygnus Hyoga from Saint Seiya." "Diamond Dust, age 19, from Yokosuka." That one sounds dangerous. Okay, next. "If you like The Godfather, especially Part II, please write!" That kind of gave me a thrill. Really? You can have them. "Whoever reads this pen pal page first, contact me." "Inu-cara, age 20, from Nakano City." What's "Inu-cara"? Show me. This one. Here. That's Kenji Ozawa's first album, The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on. You like Kenji Ozawa? Yeah. Here. This kind of thing, you can keep. - What? - Take it. Go on. Take it. I'm starving. INU-CARA, HEAD OVER HEELS! How many minutes for this? One more minute, I think. Do you like Kenji Ozawa? DO YOU LIKE KENJI OZAWA? - Bye. - Bye. - Want to go play pachinko? - Not today. TO: MR. MAKOTO SATO FROM: INU-CARA DEAR MR. SATO, THE LEGENDARY KENJI OZAWA IS MY PRINCE. FROM INU-CARA Dear Mr. Sato. Hello. I'm Inu-cara. So you like Kenji Ozawa too, Mr. Sato. The song that made me a fan of his is "A Scene of Angels." It came on when I was listening to the radio and reached out and grabbed my heart. I was feeling down, and it really spoke to me. That's when I became a fan of Kenji Ozawa. When I first listened, I couldn't understand him. But gradually, it felt like his songs were asking me, "What is the soul?" "What is life?" KENJI OZAWA - REACH OUT OF THE DARKNESS The Inu-cara album is an album about freedom and desires. The Maya Maxx exhibition is a good idea. I'll be carrying a WAVE bag. From Inu-cara. I'M UGLY. I'M SURE YOU'LL REGRET MEETING ME. A WAVE bag? A WAVE bag. Welcome. Table for two. That was pretty crazy. Yeah. I'd like some coffee to help me get back to reality. Two coffees. To be honest... I really didn't understand it. I think that's all right. If you knew what it was all about, there's no point in seeing it. I think it's okay for some things to be left a mystery. Don't you think that makes it stick with you longer? Yeah, I do. Do you watch anime? Yeah. How many times have you seen Beautiful Dreamer? Maybe twice? That's all? How many times have you? I have no idea. I always played it while I was home. Inu-cara, you're pretty crazy. You think so? The other night, they talked about weird people like you on Denki Groove's All Night. I'm a weird person? But don't you think that movie's really nice? It's always the day before the school festival. Could there be anything better? If there was a day in my life that was really great, I'd want to be locked away inside it. Don't you agree? I totally agree. Thanks. What has your life been like? Well... Ordinary. And depressing. Ordinary and depressing. In high school, I marked every day on the calendar with an X for every day that I didn't commit a crime. Pretty weird, right? I think that's interesting. That's a pretty skirt. I drew these with a felt-tipped pen. Really? There was a pretty flower-designed Keita Maruyama skirt, so I tried to draw it. You're amazing, Inu-cara. I'm ugly and poor, so I make the best of what I have. Really? That shirt is nice too. I'm doing my best to make three-quarter sleeves a summer fad. My name is Kaori. ROPPONGI KASHIWA BLDG. 4 You know, I'm surprised you applied for a job you know so little about. - It sounded kind of interesting. - I see. How old are you two now? I'm 22. I'm 21. You were born in February. We're in the same year in school. Well, I'm sure it'll be pretty brutal at the start. However, until I'm able to make up for all that brutality, I will not stop! You sure are passionate. Will you work with me? Yes! I can start today! Tomorrow is fine. You're hired. What about you? Well, okay. Starting next week. Great! You're hired! All right. Read these. They're for Photoshop and Illustrator. - Thanks. - Those are enough to get you started. "Adobe Photoshop." Well... I went to... the interview. I got hired. I knew you would be. That's great. Let's celebrate. I'm supposed to say that. Why don't we go somewhere? Yeah, but where? Like Disneyland or something? What? Okay. Like Disneyland or... a love hotel? What? How come? To celebrate, right? Besides, I'm sleepy. You'll go if you're sleepy? Yes, to celebrate with the guy I like and because I'm sleepy. - What? - What? Well, I... "Like"? Yeah. You... like me? Yeah. You like me? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Then... I look forward to this. Me too. Congrats on your release. This isn't a prison. - Take it. - No thanks. No thanks. - Take it, dammit! - No thanks! Fine! I'll take it! Go! I'll send you tons of our cakes. No, thank you! Bye. Yeah. Sato! Mr. Sato! Thank you! Best of luck! See you around! Good luck! He left. Yeah. You're okay not telling him? It would only annoy him if I said I loved him. I'm going to go now. - See you later. - See you. Good night. Good night. Hello? I just finished. It was a lot of fun. Totally. And listen to this. It's amazing. They gave me 30,000. Isn't that crazy? Isn't that amazing? 30,000! What? Karaoke? I'd love to! ALL ROOMS REMODELED! WELCOME REST (3 HOURS) - 10,000 YEN STAY (UP TO 18 HOURS) - 20,000 YEN This is my first time. What? Is that right? How about here? It's inexpensive. Sorry. Just kidding. Come on. Go. That's 5,800 yen. I'll cover it. Wow! This is amazing! Wow... What's this? Oh, wow! Awesome! This is crazy! The bath lights up like a rainbow! You're heavy! That's rude! I want to go to the beach. MICHEL DE NOSTRADAMUS ...related books are lined up and there are more than 50 kinds now. They occupy the top of the best ten. What exactly does his prophecy mean? Is the Great Prophecy of Nostradamus really... CAN THEY BE BELIEVED? My company made these graphics. Is that right? Yeah. I only deliver things though. Let's turn off the lights. The bath. That much is okay. No... Can I? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Want to stop? I'm okay. When I'm happy, I feel sad. Yoasobi Night Safari! This doesn't quite seem like what we asked for. Well, when I made this, I referred to... Yeah, it is different, but... So you saw through us, huh? Do you even remember the meeting the other day, Takashi? - I remember... - You don't even have notes. I have notes right here. I thought you'd forgotten. - I remember it! - Right, Kurosaki? Well, I... I thought it was nice! - It's better than I expected. - Yeah. Well, I don't think it's bad. What if we adjust the lettering? All right. I will. - You can do that? - Yes, I can. Then it's all right if we go with this, right? - Yes. Fix at least that part. - Yes. - Okay. Thank you. - Thank you too. Goodbye. Goodbye. Today, another 201 people have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in Tokyo. YEAR 2020 This is biggest number so far, and the first time it has exceeded 200. According to the Tokyo government... Kurosaki, don't push yourself too hard. What? Don't push yourself too hard. Don't put all your energy into it. I see. Yeah, but I get the feeling that if I'm not serious about it, I can't be true to myself. Yeah, I guess so. How about a little drink tonight? Isn't now a bad time? Then in Minato City, there have been 168 cases. And in Suginami City and... Yeah, I suppose you're right. Sorry. I'll lose my subsidy if I stay open later. I've only had two drinks. - I'm sorry. - I'm already hammered at 8 p.m. Very funny. See you again. Hey! - Cut it out! - Just get out of here! - Let go! - I will! Just get out! Fine. I won't talk to other customers. You've said that before! That hurt! Hey! Give that back! - Hey! - You've said that before. You're mean! You're so mean! Don't come back! Darn you! Nanase? What? What are you doing? Same to you. I see you're doing well. Why did you close your pub? I couldn't stand talking to customers I didn't like as if we were friends. They can leave whenever they like, but I can't escape. You don't have a choice. You're running a pub. You can't understand, can you? Yeah, I guess not. We don't get customers where I work. How are Sekiguchi and the others? Well, he's running an online cram school. You know, where you study over the Internet. It looks like he's doing great and getting lots of students. So he's doing good. But I heard he got divorced. I see. I can't laugh at other people's misfortune anymore. I can tell the difference between your puke and Sekiguchi's. - That's disgusting! - Your puke is pink! That's a total lie! No, I'm serious! Do you know how many gallons of your puke I've cleaned up? I could live forever on all the food you puked back up! That must have been really rough. I can't say thanks enough. You've become a real jerk of an adult, haven't you? - Wait! Whoa! - That hurts! This reeks! You okay? Can you get up? You guys have it good. I mean, I've got nothing. Nothing at all. You're all leaving me behind. You're crazy. Come on. Get up. Leave me be! Why not just leave me here? I'll go to the dump with the rest of this trash! That's right. Eighty percent of the people in this world are trash, aren't they? What about the other 20%? They're scum. That's so cruel! You're the one who said it. I think that there is at least 1% who is all right. Those people aren't all right. They're just oblivious to reality! Fine! All right! Okay... Let's go home. Want to come to my place? Oh, stop it. I don't want your petty kindness. You've always been that way. You're cold on the inside, but you're kind just on the surface. No wonder you're single. You are too. I'm a passionate person. That's why I'm single. That makes no sense. I can't take it anymore. I wish I'd never met you. I'm... I'm glad I met you, Nanase. Go on! Get in that taxi and return to reality! Go on! - To Meguro. - Yes, sir. For people like us, when we work, we can't drink at bars late at night. It's really rough. It really is. And the city is dark now by 8 p.m. It's actually a little depressing. Well, there's not much we can do about that right now, but at times like this, there's a song I'd like to play for you. However you're feeling now, I'd like you to feel positive about yourself. But if you're not feeling positive now, I'm sure the kindness in this song will be like a salve to lots of people when you look back on it later. It's for those people that I want to play this song. So let's listen to "Like a Comet" by Kenji Ozawa. - Excuse me, please stop here. - Yes, sir. - I'll use my card. - Okay. Thank you. When we're here, it doesn't feel like time is passing. It's like time for us alone has stopped. Everyone else keeps growing older, but we stay the same. That sure would be nice. You'll be just fine. You're interesting. Will you be like this after we marry? Give me back all those years! - I've got a kid on the way. - Let's go together! Who cares what it is? Just get the heck out of here. Congrats on your release. I've got nothing. Living like this... really isn't all that bad. Have a little pride in your work! Nobody looks at that damn shit! Come here! Your body is filled too, with words waiting to go to heaven. When I'm happy, I feel sad. I hope you stay cooped up here forever! - We're getting married. - Did you want to be like you are now? Until I make up for all that, I will not stop! Ordinary is the best. That seems so ordinary. Even though you're in darkness, Mr. Sato, someday, I'm certain that a light will shine down onto you. A WAVE bag? A WAVE bag. Are you Inu-cara? Now that you say it, it's embarrassing. She really was... pretty darn ordinary. WE COULDN'T BECOME ADULTS WE COULDN'T BECOME ADULTS INTO ADULTS, WE...
