'The planet Earth was an unusual place to film an intergalactic adventure, "but this had never stopped the BBC before." That's it. Third left, just after that sun. Oh, anywhere will do. The northern hemisphere would be marvellous. Thank you very much. "This is about the making of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy," "and Arthur Dent is coming home." Oh, just drop me on the corner. "The making of the television series" "of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy" "began with filming in 1980" "at this farmhouse somewhere in Sussex." I spent about two months searching all of southern England looking for the right sort of house for Arthur Dent to stay in. I found myself lost one day, when I was on my way back to the BBC. I turned a corner there and I saw exactly what I was searching for. So, I knocked on the door and this young lady answered it. I said, "Can we film here? We'll be absolutely no trouble whatsoever." I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered… and whipped and boiled! Strangely enough, the place is still standing. It must be 12 years or more since I've been here. I wonder if I left the gas on. PRESIDENT Ronald Reagan? Argentina? The Falkland Islands? That's off Scotland, surely? Saddam Hussein? "Douglas Adams, who created The Hitchhiker's Guide," "had previously been a hospital porter," "a chicken shed cleaner and a bodyguard." So, anyway, I was completely broke. Very little I'd turned my hand to had, sort of, worked at all. One of the things I tried to persuade people to be interested in was the idea of doing comedy science fiction. I went to one person after another with one version after another. Then, oddly, one producer I happened to know… Simon Brett, who was one person I hadn't approached with this… came to me and said, "You know what I think would be a great idea?" "Doing comedy science fiction, and you might be the person to do it." And then I remembered this thought I had had years earlier when I'd been lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck about The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. I thought of Ford Prefect as a researcher for the Guide. That was when it began to come together. "The radio series was first broadcast late at night" "in March 1978 on BBC Radio 4." "And its fame soon spread." - Why not share it with friends? - Because I want to keep them! (DOUGLAS ADAMS) Simon nurse maided it through all the difficulties of the programme development groups at the BBC. It was a very difficult notion to get anyone to accept, but once Simon was on board and pushing it, he eventually got it made. Geoffrey Perkins then took over for the rest. - The two million robots thing… - Two million robots. If you have two million singing, you won't hear what they're singing. After we made the first episode, it took the BBC a long time to make up its mind about the series. So I had to find other work from anywhere I could. An obvious place to send that first script as an example of what I could do was Doctor Who. The concept is staggering. Pointless, but staggering. Gratified you appreciate it. Appreciate it? APPRECIATE it?! Inevitably, what happened was that commissions to write the rest of the series of Hitchhiker and four episodes of Doctor Who came in in the same week. So, from then on, I was working crazily. "Hitchhiker soon became a stage play," "a book, records, a second radio series," "more books, records, a computer game and a towel." The first time I had anything to do with Hitchhiker was when somebody in radio said it would make an ideal TV series. I listened to it and thought there was no chance it could be on TV. The sets would be too big and the effects too costly. Three months later, John Howard Davies, the Head of Comedy then, called me in and handed me a script and said, "I want you to do this for television." I looked and it was Hitchhiker. I said, "It can't be done." People of Earth, your attention, please. "They built studios full of starship holds and bridges," "constructed corridors, compartments, dining rooms" "and the Restaurant at the End of the Universe." "On the sound stages of the old Ealing Films," "super-computers crackled into life, exotic people made toasts," "whilst in Cornish clay pits," "sperm whales met their sticky end." Eugh! "They took cavemen to the Peak District," "held shoot-outs at Henley Golf Course" "and flew spaceships over London," "before finally blowing up the planet." "And through it all, the actors struggled with their lines…" Fuck! I can't remember the fucking line! "… their costumes, their makeup," "and last, but not least, the overwhelming technicalities" "of Life, the Universe and Everything." (TRILLIAN) Thank you. Two to the power of 24,000… Ohhh! Sorry… shit. Shit. When it came to cast the television series, I was in favour of keeping as many of the cast from the radio show as possible, and Alan, I think, wanted to re-cast everything, and we came to a compromise. - I bought some peanuts. - Huh? We've been through a matter transference beam. You've probably lost some salt. The beer you had should have cushioned your system a bit. How are you feeling? Like a military academy… bits of me keep passing out. I was very reluctant to take willy-nilly, lock stock and barrel, the radio production and simply put it on TV. So, we saw the artists from radio. One by one they came, and Simon Jones was in every way how I had seen Arthur Dent. "Douglas Adams wrote the part of Arthur with Simon Jones in mind." "They had worked together before on a little-known comedy show." - They are so pretty. - What are? The peonies. Look… Isn't it pretty? What's this, then? - A peony. - Oh, you admit that? "Out of the Trees" was a television show I wrote with Graham Chapman and Bernard McKenna. And… er… it was… it was only semi-brilliant. It was in the lower end of brilliant, down towards not terribly good! Shurrup! We'll ask the owner if he minds us taking a peony. If he does, I'll pay compensation. Anyway, it was obstructing the pavement. Don't try and be clever with us! - Not yet! - Got nothing better to do?! We've got a difficult one. Sergeant! Look, mate, would you like to come to the station and be INTERVIEWED? Can be very NASTY being interviewed. Are you threatening violence? Right! Send for reinforcements! More police cars converge on the area. There's an accident and ambulances come. More accidents, then… er… fire brigades. Then, sort of, nuclear missiles. Eventually, because this was the point when I took over, as a result of all this, the world blows up. - What happened to the Earth? - It's been disintegrated. - Has it? - Yes. It just boiled away into space. Listen, I'm… I'm a bit upset about that. Ah, well. When it came to casting Ford Prefect, it was more difficult, because in televisual terms, I felt we needed somebody a bit odd. Somebody that looked ordinary, but wasn't quite ordinary. How long have you known me? Five years, maybe six. Most of it made some sense. All right, how would you react if I told you I'm not from Guildford, but from a small planet somewhere near Betelgeuse? I don't know. Is it the sort of thing you're likely to say? Drink up. The world is about to end. We saw a lot of actors, then David Dixon came in. And he performed intelligently. He understood the humour, what the author was trying to do. What you should do here… I thought what I'd… In real life, when you're bored, you do that. When you're acting bored, you pretend you're interested. Alan said he wanted somebody off the wall and who has weird eyes. He said, "You're off the wall and have weird eyes." So that was it. He said, "We've cast you because you've got weird eyes", "but would you mind wearing purple contact lenses?" I thought purple contact lenses might become useful, going to see the bank manager or something like that. Put purple lenses in and ask for a few grand. Don't knock it, it worked. Where the hell are we? I hardly like to say, but it looks like Southend. God, I'm relieved to hear you say that. I thought I was going mad. I remember being asked to do Hitchhiker, and I had never even heard of it before being asked to do it. I rushed around and got the record out from the radio programme and thought, "What a good thing. Shame I missed it." Only problem was, there was no money to do it on. You think, "Do we go to infinity?" And Alan Bell was very keen on trying to include the effect that there was always infinity out there. We decided we'd try and do that on a glass shot. "Far across the studio, high on a scaffolding tower," "stood a large sheet of glass, a camera and a bored Frenchman." (ALAN BELL) TV studios have a limitation in size. You have to make it bigger than you can physically afford to. So, the conventional way is to get a big lump of glass and paint all the bits of the set you want beyond what the camera sees. There's a hole in the painting and the studio set is seen through it. But this tied up one of our few cameras for a whole day. We had prepared it in advance. It is all prepared. It is all ready. It has been ready for hours. I'm just standing finishing little bits and pieces that we fancy. I thought, "We can't do this for subsequent episodes." So, I thought about it and thought, "Maybe we can do it in reverse." "Maybe we can photograph our scene full size," "take the photograph and slap it on the glass," "and then have the artist paint it bigger, as big as we want." Then he can match his colours to us. Nobody thought that it would work, so I borrowed some scenery from Top of the Pops and asked my daughter to wander around. This was during a show, while they were running a film. They had a camera in the gallery and shot downwards, took a full-frame photo of it, slapped it on a piece of glass and, amazingly, it worked brilliantly. And so, instead of only being able to have one picture per episode, we sometimes had five or six of these matte shots. And I think the series benefited from that. There was always something… There was no time to experiment, so there was always something not as we imagined and the perspective wasn't quite right. For me, the one that worked best was the one in the first programme, the Vogon hull, when Arthur and Ford go in for the first time. (ARTHUR) Where are we going? (FORD) Who knows? Off this ship, that's for sure! (ARTHUR) Shouldn't we go and say thanks? This is a Vogon spaceship. We just pick up what we need and we get off it, right? Right. Stun guns. - Any good? - No. Ford, who ARE you? I told you. I'm a field researcher for the Guide. Telecom systems. What excited me about it was that Alan was willing to put more money into the effects side of it to get a higher standard, and also experiment a bit and try new and untried methods, or at least give me the leeway to attempt them. Normally, model shots are always left to the end and rushed, put in a small corner of one of the studios. But on this one, we were allowed the whole studio as a model set-up, whereby we could go in and combine all the model shots electronically. We took camera tracks into the studio, all the backgrounds, and we did get a lot of model shots done for the time that we had, which I don't think would have been done any other way. (FORD) I think this ship is new. (ARTHUR) Why? Can you date metal? No, I found the sales brochure on the floor. It says the Universe can be yours for five quilliard Altairian dollars. A quilliard is a whole page of noughts with a one at the start. Ah, listen! "Sensational new breakthrough in improbability physics." "As the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability," "it passes simultaneously through every point in the Universe." "Be the envy of other governments." I mean, WOW, this is really big league stuff! Well, it's better than that dingy old Vogon crate. Gleaming metal. This my idea of… Fuck! Bah… I'm talking rubbish! That'll go in the Christmas tape. One of the most challenging projects was the book itself. What is going on?! - Here, have a look at this. - What is it? The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. A sort of book. I like the cover. "Don't Panic." That's the first helpful thing anybody's said all day. That's why it sells so well. The normal way to do something like this is put a blue screen on it and electronically insert the information we wanted to see. Unfortunately, that means you're locked off. You can't move the camera or zoom in. Which isn't very exciting. Look… Fast wind index… V. Vogon Constructor Fleets. See what it says and I'll keep watch. "Vogon Constructor Fleets…" (JIM FRANCIS) We made up a rig which basically projected onto the back of the book and allowed the artist to move his hand, or the camera to zoom in or out or move round, which made it much more interesting. (DOUGLAS ADAMS) Of course, we were transferring it from radio to TV, and there were things there specifically because it was radio. For instance, the narrator. If it had started on TV, it would never have had a narrator. But on radio, the narrator had been an integral part of its character. So, the narrator had to be in the TV series. So the question is, how do you put a narrator in? The answer turned out to be having this graphic display of the readout of the book. "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is a remarkable book." "The introduction starts:" Something that started out as a problem that arose from transferring from radio to TV, turned out to be one of the most original and rewarding aspects of making the television show. "None at all is exactly how much suspicion" "the ape descendant, Arthur Dent, had" "that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape," "but was, in fact," "from a small planet somewhere near Betelgeuse." "Arthur Dent's failure to suspect this" "reflects the care with which his friend blended into human society" "after a fairly shaky start." "When he first arrived, the minimal research he had done" "suggested that the name Ford Prefect would be inconspicuous." We had this new young assistant that had just started with us. He was crazy about Hitchhiker, Doctor Who, anything connected with that. One day, he disappeared off down the corridor. Apparently, he'd heard sounds coming from a BBC cutting room. In there, apparently, was Alan Bell, doing work for Jim'll Fix It about R2D2. I did a film about The Empire Strikes Back, the making of it. We were in a little cutting room in Ealing, playing back the soundtrack of R2D2. And a voice appeared at the door… came through the door saying, "Excuse me, is that R2D2?" I said, "Yes". And this little chap, Kevin Davies, said to me, "You know, we have an animation company downstairs" "who really want to work on Hitchhiker." "Would you look at their work?" I thought, "Fine, but I don't want to commit myself too early." But we saw Rod's work and it was brilliant. We did a pilot, which was the first half of the Babel Fish sequence. And on the strength of that and the price that that came out at, the rest developed from there. "Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence…" I love these computer graphics! Computer graphics? What computer graphics? For heaven's sake, man, this WAS 12 years ago, you know! AAAAAAAH… OW! So long, and thanks. Now, look here! I can see this will take some explaining. Now, pay attention, Earthman. "If it wasn't computer graphics, then Lord knows how they did it!" "Rod Lord, that is, Rhodesian-born animator" "and ex-hairy person, who designed and directed" "the Hitchhiker animation." "There was nothing FISHY here at Pearce Studios" "in the western sprawl of London." "Rod and his team slaved into the small hours for much of 1980," "with just Rod's Hendrix cassettes for comfort." "Watch out, Grandpa! The Ravenous Bugblatter Beast is at the door!" "Pencil drawings were made based on Rod's storyboards." "These were traced in ink onto clear acetate animation cells." "The cells were taken into the darkroom, often by young Kevin," "and turned into photographic negatives." "The result-clear lines on a black background." "Back to the studio," "and a few daubs of black paint will see to any errors," "whilst Rod chose colours, planned camera moves," "and timed it to Peter Jones' recordings." A-HEM! "Moving swiftly along, then." "Lots more painstaking hours," "labouring over a hot rostrum to the strains of Carlos Santana." "Frame by frame, and lit from below," "the many different pieces of artwork" "were photographed onto 16mm or 35mm film." "Often there were over 12 exposures on the same celluloid strip." "It's hard to believe in these high-tech days," "but all the lines of computer type in the animated sequences" "were uncovered letter by letter" "with tatty little bits of black card." "This pile represents the artwork needed for episode one!" "They certainly BOxED clever at Pearce Studios!" "No wonder Rod Lord won the 1981 British Academy Award," "and several others," "for his work on…" "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy!" There! I think we've cleared that up. (ROD LORD) I was amazed to be informed that I'd been nominated for a BAFTA award, but it seemed a great opportunity to go for some wine. The time came to announce the winner and I was flabbergasted to find that I was supposed to walk up to the stage and actually receive this thing! The trouble was, because I was so convinced I wouldn't be going up, I was the only person in the place not wearing a tie! Princess Anne was standing there waiting to meet me, and I looked like a real slob! They tried adding a laughter track to the show, which I was cringing at. I couldn't bear the idea of having a laughter track on it. I think they'd shown it to an audience at the NFT and put a laughter track on it. Barman, quickly, can you just give me four packets of peanuts? I'm just serving this gentleman. No point. He'll be dead soon! (CANNED LAUGHTER) Do you MIND, sir?! "The pilot episode was screened to 100 sci-Fi fans" "in July 1980." "BBC policy then said all comedy shows should have a laughter track." "However, after it was shown to critics at a film festival," "thankfully, the idea was dropped." - The world will really end? - In three minutes, five seconds. - Is there anything we can do? - No, nothing. Lie down? Put a paper bag on your head? (LAUGHTER) Yes, if you like. - Will that help? - No. Excuse me. I've got to go. Oh, well… Last orders, please. Many of you will have already realised that the main reason for the gigantic success of Hitchhiker was the choice of actor to play the narrator. The BBC, quite naturally, wanted the very best… an actor who would bring to the part stature and respect. And I was absolutely thrilled when they came to me and said… …he wasn't available and would I like to play the part? I agreed that they could use my voice-over, and in return I would star in a show of my very own. And they kept their word. This is it. Welcome to Starship Heart of Gold. Please do not be alarmed by anything around you. You are bound to have initial ill effects, as you have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of two to the power 260,199… (ALAN BELL) The Trillian character was the most difficult to cast. In the radio series and, I think, in Douglas Adams' book, she is English. I read the first book and she is described as dark and Indian-looking, or whatever, and I thought I hadn't got a chance. Alan thought I'd be good in the part of Trillian, but Douglas needed convincing. When he suggested her I thought he was mad. Oh, great, for this I get my ears pierced (!) Listen, with half the wealth of the Galactic Empire stored in it… A whole bunch of actresses came in and read for the part. Trillian is actually not the world's richest and meatiest part. It doesn't have a huge amount of character texture there. Trillian? Er… er… PASS! There's not a huge amount for an actress to get hold of. But when Sandra came in to read for it, she instantly… The way she read it, just in terms of rhythm and timing, it was quite clear she was the right person to do it. (COCKNEY ACCENT) Got to get me Union Jack lenses in. (DOUGLAS ADAMS) She said, "What accent? I'll do whatever you like." But I was feeling so much that I'd been proved wrong here, and I said, "No, no, use your own voice." - This is a rehearse, right? - No, this'll be a take. Do you want a rehearsal? I'll go for one and if it's no good, we'll do another, OK? I'm not sure that was a wise decision. And not a particularly flattering one for Sandra. She is a very good actress and she can do a wide range of accents. It probably would have done her some good if we'd let her show that by doing it English. We have normality. I repeat, we have normality. Anything you still can't cope with is your own problem. - Who are they? - A couple of guys we picked up. (ZAPHOD) That's a sweet thought, but is it really wise right now? Here we are on the run. We've got half the Galaxy after us. (DIRECTOR) Hold it. I have to say Sector ZZ-9. - Fuck! - No, just Sector ZZ-9! I have to read it off the screen, that's why it's… Sure, I didn't realise. (MUMBLED APOLOGIES) So, ten out of ten for style, but minus several million for good thinking! They were floating in open space. You didn't want them to die, did you? No, not as such. A second later and they'd be dead. So, if you'd thought a moment longer, it would have gone away! I didn't pick them up. The ship did-all by itself. - Hey, what?! - What? - The ship picked them up itself. - So what? Oh, forget it and go back to sleep. I don't know why I was employed. Possibly because when I was at university, um… this was… I was at university from 1967 to 70. The big year is '68. "Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," "but to be young was very heaven." So, I was sort of long haired and kaftaned and all that stuff. I was also in the Footlights, a Cambridge revue club. So, I sort of thought, "Maybe it's to do with this." That's why they'd cast me. It was a residual drop-over from that. But, actually, talking to Douglas, it was nothing to do with that. It was simply that I'd been in a series, The Glittering Prizes, a TV series about undergraduates and stuff. We picked them up in Sector ZZ-9 Plural Z Alpha. - Yeah? - Does that mean anything to you? Sector ZZ-9 Plural Z Alpha? What does the Z mean? - Which one? - Any one. Would you mind looking at the Galactic charts? In a minute. I've got sunning to do. They said, "How do you see this guy?" And I had sort of seen him as a sort of long-haired beach bum, blond, kind of quick, all that. He turns out to have red hair, big eyebrows and this head which became my best friend, of course! Give me Tropicana! Tropicana (!) HEY! …HEY! What did you…?! There! Almost exactly where you picked me up. Yeah. Hey, that's wild! (TRILLIAN) Two to the power of 200,000 to one against and falling. What's that? Don't know. Sounded like a measurement of probability. What does it mean? I had done a bit of science in my time at university. Not that I knew what I was saying, but it wasn't completely foreign to me. I'd never done a sort of sci-Fi thing quite like that before. I'd done a few episodes of The Tomorrow People, but nothing where you had to look at something not there so often. Welcome to the Starship Heart of Gold. Please do not be alarmed by anything you see or hear. Part of the problem was, we were getting messages on set, "We're doing this bit", but nobody would explain what was happening. (DAVID DIXON) Here we are! Over here. (SIMON JONES) There's no camera. I can't see one. It's none of our business. So, you'd be told to sit there and do that speech. And you'd think, "What?" And of course, all these effects are laid on afterwards behind you. So it really is a bit, sort of, brain fazing, a lot of it. (FLOOR MANAGER) Can we keep it quiet, please?! The transmission light is on, I don't want to have to shout! Psych-psych-psych! I developed this technique after a while of psyching myself up. I used to jump up and down and say, "Psych, psych". I'd leap about like a maniac. I think what I meant to say was psycho, but I was probably being a bit too literal. I was going out of my brains in some ways. You're just standing in front of all this technology, and people spend a lot of time. And you need a lot of energy. Because Douglas's work is full of energy. I've got wires coming out of my head here! I didn't want to get the feeling that I was going to slide into it, like a record slowly going… "A-Arthur, this is in-incredible." I wanted to hit it. This is FANTASTIC, Arthur! We've been picked up by… by… by the… thh! My leg's drifting off into the sunset. (SIMON) I was one of the few not surprised by the green screen. Because we had done radio, if you remember, where we'd done it like a jigsaw, with no special effects at all, no audience, no narrator and half the cast missing. Perhaps the odd spot effect, but very few of them. So, the fact we had to imagine all the rest came naturally to me. It's a children's fantasy game… pretend this, pretend that, pretend what's happening here. Then pretend your reactions to it. Quite interesting, really. Quite an acting exercise. I'm off, then. I can put my arms back together, can I? Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you could drop in. It's fascinating if you really look at where there's a hi, hi, hi, with three arms, which is just someone standing behind me with another sleeve on. You can tell which is not my hand, simply because the way that it is acted is not quite an actor doing it. It's someone doing it, but not really meaning hi. They're simply doing the gesture. Zaphod Beeblebrox. This is a very large drink. Hi. Zaphod had to have two heads, there was no question about that. I thought, maybe as a TV adaptation, we'd get away with one, but we had to have two. So, the Visual Effects Department did a brilliant job. They made a head that moved in every way, the eyes blinked, it worked. If you compare what they did then with what is available now, the animatronics where it really looks 1,000% perfect, looking back to what our Visual Effects Department did, it was absolute rubbish. It is, of course, a model, created by the Visual Effects Department. Effects Department, that should be. And it took them less than six weeks, which is pretty good going. It's designed to act just like a human head. They have managed to create a head roll, a roving eye… …a winking eyelid, a nod and a moving mouth. The workings owe nothing to the ventriloquist's dummy, no strings, no rods or levers. Instead, an ingenious adaptation of a remote control set as used by model aircraft enthusiasts. If we look inside its head… Wish he wouldn't do that! Sorry. There we are. We can see the top layer there of his cosmic brain. These two small black boxes are the signal receivers. Any instructions sent by the operator arrives in one of these. It's relayed to the part of the head you want moving. This black switch here happens to move the eyelid. Each of the others controls minor actions like eye rolling and mouth twitching. There's a second layer of electronics underneath that one operating more complex movements such as head roll and nod. In fact, the head pivots down here on nothing more sophisticated than a model helicopter joint. He wasn't great… as a head. Partly, I think, because of the complicated mechanics of it. That meant it tended to look like a slightly anorexic younger brother of mine. If you ran, the head bouncing stripped the gears on the mechanism within it. So, there was a constant war between people saying, "Look, slow down," or, "He's stripped the gears." That would be another hour and a half or whatever. The head also got paid… Well, it didn't get paid, but I think it cost more than I got paid for the whole series. That's not a grudge that I bear it. It's just a fact. My first memory of it is Mike McCarthy, who was the sound supervisor, and Alan Bell-director, coming to the BBC Radiophonic Workshop studios. We talked about my involvement in it. At that time, there were wrangles going on. I think Douglas wanted the music done by somebody else, probably Tim Souster. Mike Oldfield was involved in doing a version of the title music, I think. Anyway, it was decided that I would do the sound effects for the series and the incidental music. The first thing to happen was that Alan Bell would do a briefing and tell me exactly what he envisaged for the episode. (PZ-ZZ ZOOM!) And there are, like, breakers going inside. You know, electric breakers going. (ALAN MAKES SPACE INVADERS SHOOTING NOISES) - As in a space game… - The same noises. Very electronic. I'll have to go down to Warwick Castle and do some location recording. (SOFT ELECTRONIC SHOOTING) They go on through a couple of… (CLUNKING BANGS) I think that looks, visually, about the best. It is reasonably easy, this one, isn't it? Yes, it's all right. Yes. I've been promising you that for ages! You think it's easy when you say it quickly like that, then you go away and you think, "God, I've another week of this! I don't know if I'll last." Are you still there? Yeah! - We didn't enjoy that at all. - We could tell! My main job was doing music for the computer graphics sections and adding sound effects that went in synch with what was going on on screen. So you had two tapes that I was providing. One was a music tape and the other was the synchronised effects tape. It was better that I did the whole thing, because I could make all the bleeps in the same key as the music. Mike McCarthy was the sound supervisor for the whole project and he was keen the thing would sound tight. A lot of Hitchhiker takes place in spaceships on an obviously metal or futuristic material floor. Actually, people are walking round on cardboard and wooden rostrums. BBC shows that are done in the studio don't normally run to dubbing on footsteps, but Hitchhiker did. It took quite a lot of time to do it. People walking on metal floors was done with a new technique then, which was beer kegs upturned and volunteers treading in synch with people's feet. "Occasionally, voices had to be re-recorded, too." "In this instance, because of a noisy wind machine on location." (FAN DROWNS SPEECH) I think I'll have a little lie down! No, stay here! Stay calm! Hold this! Is your voice all right, David, or is that deliberate? I think it'd be better not quite so throaty. I think I'll have a little lie down. No, stay here! Stay calm! Hold this! Very good, that one. "Having spent the morning in a darkened dubbing theatre," "the cast and crew head off to attend a Vogon costume fitting" "at a special effects workshop in Putney." "Simon Jones was already a familiar face here," "as they'd made him a 12-foot monster" "for a stage play of Doctor Who." That's me. The first costume fitting was quite an entertainment. I looked at this costume hanging up and it was vast! I thought, "I'm not that big!" When I got inside, it was hanging in great loops. I thought, "There is a picture of what I'll look like in 75 years." I've done about 83 feature films, including A Shot in the Dark with Peter Sellers, Goldfinger with Sean Connery, The King and I, of course, which I did in Hollywood, several others, including one with Errol Flynn. Hard to remember because I'm not a looking back person. On a studio day, you sit in Make-up and they put the mask on. You get into the costume and you feel as heavy as lead, like a deep sea diver. And then you amble into the studio and you think, "Thank goodness, it won't be long." Then Alan says, "I'm very sorry, there's been a delay." And you're not sure whether to take it off and have hassle putting it on again, or sweat it out. - So, Earthlings. - I'm no Earthling! Quiet! I present you with a simple choice. Think carefully, for your very lives are in your hands. Now choose. Either die in the vacuum of space, or… tell me how good you thought my poem was. I liked it. I thought some of the metaphysical imagery was most effective. (VOGON CAPTAIN) Yes? You are completely wrong. I write poetry just to throw my callous interior into sharp relief. I'll throw you off the ship anyway. Guard. Take them to number three airlock and throw them out! RESISTANCE IS USELESS! Right, hold it. Read the next piece, please. No, once more that piece, please. Let the actors get through the door! (DAVID) Have I got green on my face? - No… Ow! - You've got blood on your head. Green on our face, blood on our heads, sounds like a Potter play! All right, close the door. I'll tell my aunt what you said. Terrific (!) ARGH! Don't worry about the aliens. They're just a couple of guys. I'll send the robot to check. Hey, Marvin? I think you ought to know I am feeling very depressed. Stephen Ward, who I thought WAS Marvin, having heard him on radio, I thought that was perfect casting. Then I had a call from Alan saying, "We're offering you the part." Suddenly, the Hallelujah Chorus went up behind me, and I failed to hear the rest, which was, "By the way, you're not doing the voice!" The first studio day was particularly memorable because I was as nervous as anything. It seemed ridiculous… I had the choice of doing it as David Learner in a tin can, or reproducing the stage version Marvin as I thought of him. Thank goodness I chose the latter. It meant people in the studio had something to react to, rather than somebody in a tin can doing his shopping list. Make-up, can we have a sponge here, please? Make-up? I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed. Here's something to occupy you and take your mind off things. It won't work. I have an exceptionally large mind. In rehearsal, I was actually playing Marvin for real. The words, feelings, meanings were all exactly what I'd intended had I played the voice. I don't feel bad about that. Stephen, for me, WAS Marvin the Paranoid Android. I was just pleased to play the tin can. I don't mean to be abusive… but that's right for Marvin. Marvin, kid! - I was joking! - A very bad joke, sir. - Hey, how would you like to… - Lay down my life for you? Make the ultimate sacrifice? Consign my brain which is the size of a planet to dust? Dark… dark… There we all were at rehearsal, Acton, episode five, and it was my chance to meet Dave Prowse. Now, Dave Prowse had, of course, played Darth Vader. The Star Wars trilogy had just come out. He was huge in every sense of the word. I was playing Marvin, but not doing the voice, and he'd played Darth Vader and hadn't done the voice. And there we were on a three-seater settee. He was taking up two seats and I was taking up a ledge on the side! I said, "You must have been upset to play Darth Vader" "but not to have done the voice." I said, "Why weren't you allowed to do it?" And he said… (DEVON ACCENT) "Oi've no idea!" "No idea is exactly how much of an inkling the Hitchhiker team had "that they would be asked to look back for a "Making of…" programme "more than 12 years later." "Nonetheless, here we all are." Looking back now, over 12 years later, I think it was well worth the effort. And it was a great deal of effort. For most of the artists, it was about four weeks work, but for me, it was three months of really compressed work. From probably 9 a.m. to 2 a.m., going to the animators, editing, things like that. I thought it was disproportionate to the end product at the time, but, bearing in mind the technical limitations, I think everybody did a great job. And I find it entertaining. I can forget all the things I did in it. I watch it as a viewer and think, "Worthwhile." (DOUGLAS ADAMS) It's been frustrating for me since then, because there was talk of a movie which never happened. Now, of course, we have the ability to do fantastic computer graphics. I always felt that every film that has used computer graphics, it's always been to dress the set. It's been something pretty to look at. In Hitchhiker, we said they were a part of the way you tell the story. But it's magic, isn't it? And it lives on forever! When I'm old… It was great fun. I really feel honoured to have been part of it. Good old Douglas, eh? Right on! I think one of the major benefits of doing the TV series, and we've only just discovered this, is that Simon Jones can afford new glasses. His old ones were so frightful! Resistance is useless! Now… either die or reveal all. Tell me how good you thought this programme was. Hang on, haven't we been through this before? Arthur… Arthur… - David? - Ford. Um… shall we go for a walk? (ARTHUR) My life seems to be a television programme. Apparently, I'm played by some actor called Simon Jones. (FORD) You're bound to be confused. You've been here a while. Your blood sugar's probably a bit low. Here… have a marshmallow. In here? You've been in psycho-virtual reality since we took off. - Have I? - You wouldn't answer the phone, so I thought I'd better come and get you. Anyway, let's get out of here. We'll be landing soon. Pity. I wanted to read that Simon Jones's biog thingy. Action! What's that? They haven't started. Probably just your house being knocked down. WHAT?! Sorry. I'm so sorry. Back to the lift? - Fuck! - No! No! I'm trying to teach the cavemen to spell… No, damn! Listen to me… Oh, hell! I sound like James Cagney! These are the greatest known sunglasses in the sky… Shit! These are… FUCK! I'll carry on. Over the top? What was all that about? - Over the top (!) - Thank you very much. I thought he said there was no one here? They're SHOOTING! You said they weren't going to do. - Yes. - Fuck! They're shooting us…! Yeah, right! (CAMP VOICE) Ooh, did he? Quiet! Action. I'll chop you up into little bits until… UNTIL YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH! "I'd like to point out that Simon Jones" "is in no way related to your very talented and respected narrator." "Thank you."
