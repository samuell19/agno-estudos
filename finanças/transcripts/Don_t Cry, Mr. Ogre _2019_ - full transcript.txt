Yamaguchi throws the third pitch from the stretch. A low slider in the zone one ball and two strikes. July, 2007 Tanaka let that one go by. Yes, that was risky. That pitch was hit into left field in the second inning. Yes, Tanaka is going 3-for-4 today. He's in rhythm with the pitcher. Yamaguchi throws the fourth pitch. Ball! Two balls and two strikes. He's mixing fastballs and breaking balls but Shoeidai Fuzoku's... You know, if I don't go to the hospital I start aching all over the place and everyone worries that I'm sick. So, I go to the hospital just to prove that I'm well and alive. The count is full at 3-2. Was that a splitter? Yes, it was. He faced forward too quickly. That's why the pitch was weak. The next throw is the decisive pitch. He takes a deep breath and throws! Wada at third grabs it and throws to first. Tanaka slides! -Out! -Out! That's the game! Jonan Kogyo High goes to the finals! Jonan Kogyo beat Shoeidai Fuzoku and will go to the finals for the first time! There you go. So, that'll be 1,800 yen, please. —Here's 2,000 yen. —OK. Looking up at the mountains Looking up at the mountains Bathed in the cool moisture from the fresh water of the grand Tone River Saito Hair Salon —Thanks a lot. —Thank you. Come again. Oh, you're here. What a surprise. Shall I turn it off? The last time a public school reached the finals was eight years ago. How do you feel about tomorrow's game? Well... We'll win one more and go to the Championship. Don't Cry, Mr Ogre April, 2018 Mr Yamazaki. Mr Yamazaki Hikaru. Please proceed to Room 15. Ms Kato. Ms Kato Yuka. Please proceed to Room 6. Ms Hirata. Ms Hirata Miki. Please proceed to Room 10. In here, please. Please take a seat over there. Coach. Coach. Hey, Coach. Mr Ogre. I knew it. Remember me? Golgo, right? So you do remember. I must be really something. "Golgo"? My nickname in high school. I share the same family name with the artist who drew the manga, Golgo 13. My wife, Yukino. Why is he "Mr Ogre"? Because he looks like one. A red ogre. Can't you tell by looking at him? You're right, he does look like one. But we couldn't call him that to his face back then. He was really scary. He still looks scary. Hey, you left Jonan, right? Yeah, I'm at Nishi High now. Been there for two years. Nishi High School? That's a school for elites. But their baseball team sucks. I bet it's nothing like Jonan, huh? Our team did really well that year. But then again, I have no right to reminisce about old times. Hey, are you not feeling well? Oh... my stomach hurts. Too much stress from coaching a lousy team? Yeah, maybe. What about you? Are you unwell? Been drinking too much. Just kidding. My company told me to get re-tested. Your company? Yeah. I'm not a kid anymore. I work at a car factory. Assembly line, so I have to do night shift and the pay is horrible but the benefits are pretty decent. We can get check-ups for free. His test results didn't come back clean. Hey, he doesn't need to know that. She is such a nag. I can't stand it. She even tagged along today. Because you didn't want to come. You said it was a bother. You're all grown up now. Of course I am. You found a job and got married. You're a responsible adult now. No way. I'm still totally irresponsible. Are you still in touch with the rest? No. It's kind of hard once you quit school. I hadn't been called Golgo in so long. Mr Obuchi, thank you for waiting. Well, take care. Good luck. You too. Here you go. The pay desk is... Mr Ogre has gotten old. And he seems low-spirited. I hope it's nothing serious. Mr Saito. Mr Saito Tomoyuki. Please proceed to Examination Room Two. Nice throw. Bucchi is here. —Bucchi's here. —It's Bucchi. —Hello. —Hello! What's our practice plan? Same as usual. You decide. Yes. Excuse us. Fielding drill! Hayasaka, hit the fungoes. OK. OK, here goes! Go! —Good. —OK, third base. You could've caught that! Third base. OK, nice catch! Nice catch! —Shortstop next. —Shortstop! —Sorry! —Get in front of the ball! Come on... Nothing. Stop it with your body. You can't play ball with just your mind. I'm home. —Hi, dear. —Hi, Dad. Hey, what's wrong, Toki? Hey, Chobi. Hi there, Chobi. What's wrong, Toki? Why are you crying? —Hey, Toki. —Grandpa. Hey, what's wrong? I know, I know. It's OK. —Sleepy, maybe? —Yeah. What's wrong? My stomach still hurts. I told you to take your medicine. —I know. —Do you really? Want some warm water? I ran into a student from ten years ago at the hospital today. —Who? —His name is Saito. Saito? Golgo. Oh, I remember Golgo. —Same year as Wada. —Yeah. The team that reached the finals. Yeah. —Didn't he drop out? —Yeah. Well, he... lacked the ability to carry through. Being able to carry through is an ability. You've got to have what it takes. Yeah, yeah. What, baseball again? —Toki's asleep? —Yeah. Jonan is all he talks about. I've heard more than enough. But he's at Nishi High now so I guess he can't help it. Well... I'll go check in on my grandson. What? Don't wake him. I know. Toki's the only one who's nice to me. Let's eat this. —He's done? —Yeah, let's eat it. That man... —Is he OK? —Yes. Oh yeah, his medicine. He hasn't taken it yet? He keeps forgetting. Mr Obuchi, about our practice plan. We'd like to revise it. You're doing fine. But if we don't improve we'll lose in the first round again. Mr Obuchi, I joined the team because you're the coach. Because you coached Jonan. I hear you, but... I don't think you could keep up with Jonan's way of training. —It's impossible. —You won't even let us try. I can tell. I've coached hundreds of students. So that's how you think of us? Quit if you don't like how I do things. I won't stop you. Mr Obuchi. —You have a visitor —Who? Don't know, but she asked for you. That's her. What's wrong? I... I don't know who I could talk to. He's going to die. What? Tomo... he's going to die. What should I do? He's going to die. He's going to die. Last one! Your glove's facing the wrong way! Don't shy away! Shortstop! Hey! Get with it! Keep the ball in front of you! April, 13 years ago Nice meeting you. Next. Wada Keigo from Ishihara Junior High. I'm a left fielder. Nice to meet you. OK, next. Yes. Saito Tomoyuki, also from Ishihara Junior High. Third baseman. Other teams feared me for my speed and batting prowess... Hey. Don't flatter yourself. Golgo. —Golgo? —Saito is obviously Golgo. Why? I don't get it. Don't you know Saito Takao? Golgo 13. You don't know? It's a classic! A manga, right? Anyway, you're Golgo from today. —What? Really? —Go on. OK. Other teams feared me for my speed and batting prowess and I was known for my fielding skills. I'll improve on my skills for baseball and take the team to the Championship! Nice meeting you! —Next. —Yes. —Hello. —Hello. Hi. —Sorry for the wait. —No. Thank you for your time. Please take a seat. Yes, thank you. OK, so... We've considered your request, but... we can't fit in any more games this month. I understand, but please reconsider. —Our team is no match for yours. —No... But a strong team like yours could help ours improve. Please. Do us a favour. Please lift you head. Then... how about this? A game between our freshmen. Yes, that'd be great! You know... I used to do what you're doing to provide a learning experience for my team. Thank you. No, I look forward to it. I appreciate it. Saito Fukuda Third baseman How are the new members? They have a lot of potential. Oh, that's great. Then Coach Obuchi has work to do. Yes. —I'm home. —Hi. Hi. She has a game on Sunday too. She finally made the team. —I see. —Maybe I'll go watch. Yeah. Yeah, please. Don't be intimidated. Do your best. —Yes, sir! —Go get them! Practice game against Ryosei High School Three strikes, you're out! Three strikes, you're out! Three strikes, you're out! Centre field! Come on! Safe! Nice. Game. Thank you very much. Hey, I'm impressed. You have fine players. You're too kind. Great team. Your third baseman is fast and gifted. He still has a lot to learn. A promising future. Would you like to play another game? What? How about it? We'd love to. Then I'll go tell the students. —Yes. —Hey, gather around! Hey! I'm home. I called you so many times. Sorry, we ended up playing two games. So what? We had to call an ambulance. Is she OK? She's in her room. I'm home. Sachi, how are you feeling? Sachi. How are you feeling? I don't know. I'm sorry I couldn't be there. It's all right. I see. Well, get some rest, OK? Oh yeah. We played practice games today and won once against Ryosei High. They're a really strong team. Our freshmen this year have a lot of promise. We might make it to the Championship. I see. That's great. But... did you have to tell me that now? You're right. I'm sorry. Hey, come on! Call out to them! Intrasquad Game Communicate! Play! Foul! Darn it. Hey! Come on! What was that? It's just a bunt! Yes, I'm sorry. Team practice is over. Thank you. Thank you. Honour the field. Attention, bow. Thank you. Hey, Saito. Don't you have work to do? Bring your bat. Here goes. You're leaning forward! Here goes. This isn't a game of pool. Sometimes a bunt can decide the game. So don't skip the boring drills. Yes. A bit farther back and focus on your right hand. —Try it. —OK. Please. Practice game against Tomioka Shogyo High School Relax, Saito! Hey! —Safe! —Safe! Excuse me! Time! —Time! —Wada, switch with Saito. —Yes. —Hey, Saito! Come here! Thank you. Let's score some more! What did I signal? —A squeeze play? —Why didn't you answer? —But... —Idiot! Enough already! You're not playing alone! Go home! OK, here. Coach. Wada, are you willing to play third base? Yes. Am I... not good enough for left field? That's not why. I think you'd make a fine third baseman. You might have a better chance at it. Understood. I'll try my best. What's so funny? Just wondering why I had to hear that. Because you and Wada will compete for the position. Now to the side! You can catch that! You're leaning forward! You can do it! Hurry! Faster! Get back! Run! Move your legs! Move! Move! Come on, what are you doing? Show some guts, man! —Next, Wada! —Yes! Please! Move your legs! You can get it! Yes. —Are you OK? —I'm fine! Another one, please. —Go see the nurse! Manager! —Yes. I'm fine! Just go! —Next, Yamada! —Yes! Move! Move! Wada isn't very good. But he tries to stop the ball with his body. If only you had a fraction of his willingness to put in every effort. What? You object? I mean, we have gloves so why not use that instead of our bodies? —That's just... —Give me a break! I'm talking about... your mentality! Game against Shoeidai Fuzoku High School This is the starting lineup. —Wakabayashi. —Yes. Leadoff, shortstop, Oshima. Second batter, third base, Wada. Oh. Yes. Third batter, second base, Ogawara. Cleanup, first base, Iguchi. Fifth, catcher, Kosaka. Sixth, right field, Nakamura. Seventh, centre field, Yamazaki. Eighth, left field, Aoki. Last, pitcher, Yamaguchi. That's it. Coach, Saito went home. Went home? What do you mean? I tried to stop him but he left. Got it. Never mind. I'm sorry. Good! Good! Concentrate! Let's get this one! Hold them off! Go for it! Why? Tell me. Why did you give me this body? —Tell me, Mum. —I'm sorry. —Why? —I'm sorry. Tomo, stop it. Don't give up. I'm here with you every step of the way. OK? How do you expect me to do that? There's nothing to be done. Will surgery cure me? It won't! Divorce me. What on earth are you saying? We're all trying to get through this with you. I don't want you to see me die. What's wrong? Golgo is... dying. He's weak and cowardly. When things don't go his way he won't try to overcome it. There's no way he can go through this. Passing through. Operating Room Entering the operating room. We're handing the patient over to you. Hello. —Hi, I'm Takahashi. —I'm Kaneko. We'll be taking care of you. Tomo. Do you see me? Talk to him. Tomo. You did well. Why didn't you come for practice? Summer, 2006 You've given up? You're letting Wada keep your position? You could win it back if you tried harder. So do it. Hey... Aren't you frustrated about the unfairness of it? I guess that's the difference between you and Wada. He doesn't care what other people think. He drags himself back up. You lack that kind of strength. Be angry at me if you want. Play ball with that intensity. I don't get things like that. Feeling frustrated and all. These are for the summer preliminaries. I'll start from one. —Number one, Yamaguchi. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number two, Kosaka. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number three, Iguchi. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number four, Kato. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number five, Wada. —Yes, sir. Yes. Thank you. —Number six, Oshima. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number seven, Nakamura. —Yes, sir. —Number 19, Yamada. —Yes, sir. Thank you. —Number 20, Ishii. —Yes, sir. Thank you. That's it. Coach, you skipped number 15. Let me keep 15 open for now. Yes, sir. That's all. Dismissed. Thank you. Thank you. Honour the field. Attention, bow. Thank you! —Bye. —Bye. Bye... Work on catching pitches, Kosaka? Sure. Hey. Number 15 is going to go to Golgo, right? Why does that slacker get a number? I heard he's hanging out with Takeda. Really? He had better not cause trouble. What if he does and we get banned from playing? That'd be a disaster. I wish he'd quit the team already. I wish Coach would give me number 15. Golgo was here! Hey. Good work. Training hard, huh? What? Ignoring me? How cold. We've played ball together for so long. Keigo? You're still as serious as ever. Why bother being so serious about it? It's just baseball. Why don't you quit then? Quit if you think it's just baseball! Everyone wants you to quit the team. Even Mr Ogre! He said so too! Come on. You can't take a joke. Got it. I'm in your way. I'll disappear. Come in. So, you feel like playing again? Wada is in the starting lineup now but there will be other tournaments. Summer prelims will come again. You have enough talent to win back your position. I can't. I don't have what it takes. Don't give up before you've even tried. Hard work pays off. Believe in that, and work hard. That's a lie. Or everyone would be in the lineup then. Right? Everyone is practising hard. They're doing their best. But some are benchwarmers and some can't even sit there. We can't make it to the Championship. Hard work won't get us there. It won't pay off. That's a lie. You're lying. Right? If Wada and I both work hard, who wins? Whose hard work pays off? Even if we work equally hard, one will win. You choose who wins. Don't be a smart aleck! Say that after you try! At least try! I said I can't. Resignation Notice All right. I got it. You're awake. Tomo? I want to take Shu with me when I die. What? That would be so cruel to him. I won't be able to see him grow up now. Even so, that's horrible. Then divorce me like I said. Divorce you and do what? Find someone else and marry him. Why do you keep saying things like that? Because I don't want him to feel like I did. I used to wonder... what kind of person my dad was. Eventually, I figured things never worked out for me because I take after my dad. Turns out I'm like my dad in every way. I have nothing to leave behind for my kid. If I'd gone to the Championship Shu might've seen me in a different light. I don't have anything. He said, "Mr Ogre was really scary" and laughed. "He never complimented me." "He was always on my case." "His fungoes were hard and mean" "and he gave up on me" "when he deemed me useless." Were you that strict? He said you never smiled. When the seniors lost their last game and cried you just looked angry. So, Tomo said... "Mr Ogre won't cry when I die." I told him, "That's not true." "Of course he'll cry." You will, won't you? I can't think about that right now. Mr Obuchi. Come visit him, please? Are you done? You're not eating at all. Yeah. Worried about him? I don't know what I could do for him after all these years. You don't have the courage to face people's weaknesses. I... hated high school baseball. It took you from me. But... you're a teacher. Teachers should accept their students' weaknesses... Whoops. Tell them, "It's OK. That's who you are." And be there for them. Want it? Go ahead. She's right. There are things only you can do. You've spent more time on baseball than on your family. So don't run from him now. Saito Tomoyuki Here. —I hear it's good. —Thank you. Please. No, I'm fine. You look well. What, did you think I was bedridden? —Coach. —Yeah? Ever been to a student's funeral? What's that out of the blue? Yeah. I've been to some. Thirty years is a long time. When you have to go, how does it feel? It's unbearable. Is it sad? Sad... and really frustrating. Everyone is so much younger than I am. I remember how lively they were back in high school. I think back on those times and it's heartbreaking. Do you cry? No. I don't cry in public. I knew it. A red ogre never cries. Yeah. Saito. You've matured. Really. You've grown up. You complimented me at last. You'd never complimented me before. But a red ogre shouldn't hand out compliments. Yeah. Oh yeah. Come to think of it... you were my last teacher. —Good morning. —Good morning... Mr Obuchi. Our school is in second place, it's awesome. No, we have to win the Regional Tournament. Our goal is national level. Take us to the Championship. I'll compose a new song. An eerie tune that paralyses the other team and allows ours to pounce! A lucky song! How's that? Thank you. But seriously, no thank you. A stock epithet of spring. Anyone wants to give it a try? Invitational Tournament? Will our school be invited? We're in the middle of a lesson. We'll talk about that later. But we want to know. So, it's iffy? Well, the players did their best. If there's a god of baseball that god smiles upon those who keep believing is what I think. You're trying to sound cool. Hey, how come? It's no big deal. You sounded pretty cool there, sir. Did I? OK, got it. Bye. The last invitee is a school from Ibaraki. I guess it doesn't go that easily. However, I believe that our team this year has great potential. When summer comes please come see how much they've grown. We appreciate your continued support. Well, as you know... we didn't make it. But I haven't lost heart. We're so close to realising our dream. Yes! —I'm going to the Championship. —Yes! I don't need you if you don't feel the same. —I want to go! —I want to go! I want to go! OK, let's do it! —Yes! —Let's get to it! You're no good! You could get that one! Come on! Give it all you've got! Darn it! Next, third base! Yes! Catch it, darn it! Yes! You can get it! Next, please! —Here goes! —Please! I'll care for you if you faint, Wada! —Here goes! —Yes, please! Too slow! Is that the best you can do? Mr Obuchi! Come quick! Come quick! Mr Obuchi, hurry! Once or twice is no big deal. You can still get back on the right path. Here, eat. Don't want it? I'll eat it then. It's gone now. Are you his coach? No, his homeroom teacher. Oh, excuse me. That's what he told me. We caught them zigzagging double on a stolen scooter. But he was only riding pillion and didn't know about the theft. I'm sorry our student caused you trouble. Too bad about the invitational tournament. Saito, can you make it home? Mr Obuchi. Should I quit school? I'm thinking of quitting school. I'm a nuisance, right? What will you do after you quit? Well... nothing. If you can't even hang in there until graduation how will you make it through life? All right. Do your best. Do my best, sir? How do I do that? Nobody has ever taught me how. Hey, Mr Obuchi! The team's doing great. A top contender. We've been doing so well this year I'm feeling a bit anxious. I want the summer prelims to begin soon. The brass band wants to play at the Championship. Saito quit at the perfect time. He would've caused trouble. The Jonan Kogyo team gathers at the mound. The Gunma Prefecture preliminaries final between Ryosei and Jonan Kogyo High is at the bottom of the ninth two outs, bases loaded. The next hit will decide the game. Will Ryosei qualify for the Championship again or will Jonan Kogyo pull through and qualify for the first time? Pitcher Yamaguchi versus batter Minagawa. It's the decisive showdown. Jonan Kogyo returns to the field. Will Minagawa come through? Will Yamaguchi beat him? Yamaguchi moves into the set position throws, swung on, third base... A walk-off hit! Ryosei High School makes the Championship two years in a row! What a dramatic ending! The score is 3-2! Ryosei High wins 3-2 over Jonan Kogyo High and qualifies for the Championship! Hey, is there anything you want? Well... nothing, really. —Don't be shy. —I'm not. There's someone he wants to see. Here. Who? Tell me who it is. There's no one. —Someone named Wada. —Hey! You talk about him a lot. Nonsense. I merely mentioned him once or twice. —Yeah. —Wada? Wada Keigo OK, thank you. —Please wear this ID tag. —OK. Go to the front desk. A Mr Obuchi is here to see you. Yes, I'll tell him. He'll be right here, please wait over there. Thank you. Mr Obuchi. Wada? It's been so long. I hardly recognise you. You work at such a big company now. Well, you trained me hard. Still as humble as before. This way, please. You remember Golgo, don't you? He was in your grade. Saito Tomoyuki. Yes. But I haven't seen him since he dropped out. Did something happen? He... has cancer. Late stage. Could you go visit him? Why me? He wants to see you. Please go visit Saito. You always used to care a lot about him. Oh yeah, you converted me to third base to inspire Saito to work harder. You worked hard and won that position. You're the one... who gave up on him. We were just tools that you used to realise your dream. I'm sorry about his illness, but... I... won't go. Please excuse me. Oh, then on the 21st, please. —The 21st? —Yes. OK, understood. —See you, then. —See you. Gunma Prefectural Central Medical Centre How do you feel? When you come visit my condition stabilises for some reason. I guess the cancer also fears the red ogre. Unfortunately, I'm no longer a red ogre. What do you mean? At Nishi High, I'm Bucchi. Bucchi, from Obuchi? That's not very creative. Depending on how tanned I am I am either White Bucchi or Black Bucchi. There's some variation there. That's kind of annoying. I have absolutely no authority now. But... why did you transfer to Nishi High School? They'll never get to the Championship. I was thinking of going to root for Jonan if they ever qualified. I'm done with the Championship. You've given up? I'm tired. Before Jonan, I coached at a weaker school. The team did aim for the Championship but nothing like how Jonan did. How so? Even if we were behind by a run I'd tell a third-year benchwarmer to go pinch-hit and do his best. Even if a second-year player was better I let third-year students play the game. I never did that at Jonan. No... I couldn't do it. Why? I must have been wrong. The Championship was so close... yet so far. It messed with me. Oh yeah, about Wada. I went to see him. He seemed really busy at work. I told him about you and he said he'd try to visit but it might be hard. I see. I bet he's gotten ahead in his career. He's in charge of sales. An area business manager at his age. —An exceptional promotion. —Really? That's amazing, huh? Yeah. That's so like him. By the way remember you asked if I wanted anything? Yeah. I do, though it's not a thing. What? But it's impossible. Tell me. I... want to play baseball again. See? Impossible. He was your student at Jonan so shouldn't you be doing this at Jonan instead? He dropped out, so that's not possible. I could ask his old teammates to help out but he doesn't want that. This former student of mine... doesn't have long to live. So... please. Doctor, please. Please. I understand how you feel, but... Tomo says he wants to do it. Please let him. But... this could worsen his condition. Even so... even if something might happen we want to fulfil his wish. Doctor... please. We're home. They're home. We're home. Welcome home. Hi. There's no place like home. Shu. —How are you? —Here's Daddy. You've gotten heavier. Mum. Thanks. You know, I wanted to act cool. I wanted Yukino and Shu to see me playing baseball. He might be too small to remember, but... He'll remember. It's the only thing... I can leave behind. So... I'm glad. Thank you. Better rest up for tomorrow. I'm sorry... Shu. Take care of your mum. Grated onion improves the flavour so I just leave it in. I see. I'll try it sometime. Yeah, try it. Tomoyuki likes this. Diapers, check. Water bottles, check. Picnic sheet, check. Tomo, we packed an awesome lunch today. We have all of your favourite food. This is not a picnic. You're enjoying this too much. So what? Let's have a picnic. Yeah, it's been so long since we went anywhere. —Good morning. —Good morning. Good morning. Hello. Hello. Saito. Hey. Yes? Play catch, will you? Sure. Saito, here goes! —You must be thinking I'm a fool. —What? No. "His one regret before dying is baseball?" "Get it over with in high school." Right? Thank you. —Go, Tomo! —Go for it! Third base! Third base! Again. Darn it. OK, again! Next! Here goes! Again! Another one! Yes! Ouch... It's too hard. Throw to first! Ouch... You can do better, third baseman! You can do better. Third baseman. I still can't do it. It has to be you. You're the starter after all. You OK? Yeah. —Here. —Thanks. —Please! —OK. Nice play! Again! Nice play! Nice play! You're still Mr Ogre's favourite. Really? I got my first compliment the other day. I envied you. What? I wanted him to scold me and expect more from me too. There's something that has been weighing on my mind. Did you quit baseball... because of me? I... lied to you. Mr Ogre... never said he wanted you to quit. So, I... didn't know how to face you. I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. I... decided to give up the game. You just stay... the way you are. You're pretty amazing. Hey... Coach. I... really liked... Mr Ogre. Seriously. I mean it. Are you crying? A red ogre... doesn't cry in public. Incoming call: Saito Yukino Obuchi speaking. It's Saito Yukino. Mr Obuchi. Could you come see Tomo? Tomo... is in pain and suffering. He hasn't been sleeping. He's done such a great job so his mother and I have decided to let him sleep. Yes, I'll be there. Thank you. Yukino, you've done great too. Even when he's asleep Golgo will know you're there. He'll know until the end. Mr Obuchi... I... Saito Hair Salon Come in. Tomo, Coach is here. Mr Ogre has come to see you. Saito. Saito. Tomo, let's show him. This. Look, sir. This is Shu's birthday present. Tomo insisted on a baseball glove. I went to buy it but he wants to give it to Shu himself. He wants to impress him. He was like that since high school. He wants to look cool. Right? I know what you mean. You have a wonderful wife. It's so frustrating. You feel frustrated? It's... fru... stra... ting. That's OK. You carry that frustration now. You've grown up. You did great, Golgo. You did great. It's frustrating... and it was a near-miss... but you did your best. Thank you... for being my student. Thank you. Jonan Kogyo versus Ryosei A three-base hit before, right? Yes. Ryosei High School defeated Jonan Kogyo High School. 3-2 in the final game of the Gunma Prefecture preliminaries. It's not over yet. Is it, Coach? Bow. Hard work will pay off, won't it? Thank you. Show some guts. Don't give up. Mr Ogre! Saito. I thought I understood but I didn't understand at all, did I? Even after you quit you were always looking this way. I'm so sorry... for not noticing. Hey, Saito. You're going already? It's not over yet, is it? Golgo. OK. Here goes. —Nice throw. —Nice throw.
