Someone asked, "is anyone going to do A victim-impact statement?" I did not know what I was going to say. - No justice! - No peace! - No justice! - No peace! 26-year-old botham jean died in the shooting. - No justice! - No peace! I don't want to say twice Or for the hundredth time What you've... Or how much you've taken from us. - What's his name? - Botham jean. - What's his name? - Botham jean. We know that botham jean Was a native of st. Lucia And an accountant with pricewaterhousecoopers. Praise god this morning. The message that the murder of botham jean Sends to the african-american community Is that you're not even safe at home. I'm tired of waiting for a time When it's safe to be a black man in america. We are insisting that a charge of murder be filed. Yeah. It is murder. There were a lot of rumors that were floating around. All of a sudden, the camera goes off. We didn't understand why that video had been turned off. It is time that we recognize that lives matter. My son's life matters. Captions paid for by discovery communications Botham was the best brother you could ask for. He always encouraged me just to talk more, Laugh more and engage in conversations more. Botham was the glue, Because my 3 children are 10 years apart, But with botham in the middle, He brought both allisa and brandt together. He was always a very bright student. And when he left, he was given the top prize. We were raised to look to god first for everything, So it was just natural for him to become a strong leader In the church. It was natural for him To pick a christian university. A lot of things he did, and he did with god in mind. Hugging him on the airport... That put a hole in your heart for a little while, But then he had to go. I wanted him to... For these education. I'm botham, and I love the college of business Because it's allowed me to harness my talents And explore the world As a christian business professional. Botham was my best friend. Botham was a natural leader. People gravitated towards him in every capacity, Whether it was friendships or needing help with something. Botham was always encouraging and uplifting. We love coba faculty because without them, We wouldn't have survived college. We have jobs now. Botham wanted to be an accountant for a very long time. So to work at pwc, One of the largest accounting firms in the world, He felt like it was a blessing. We eventually moved to dallas And grew our friendship even more. I had told my husband when we started dating, like, "this man is in my life, and he will always be in my life Because I connect with him On an educational level, on a spiritual level, And he speaks my language." Botham shem jean. His plan was to get his degree from harding, Get experience working at pwc. And at the end, go back to st. Lucia And become the prime minister. That was his dream. I could have seen it already in him Because botham returned to st. Lucia For several consecutive years with a team of students To the marian home for senior citizens, And he went to clean their yards, clean their houses, Sang with them. I asked him once why he chose to do it, And he said, "mommy, people just need other people. We just need each other." When the phone rang, I just knew it was him. "hey, big sis, guess where I am." And I said, "where?" He said, "I'm on my way home." And he was excited because just a few weeks before, He had a wisdom tooth extracted, And they gave him the okay to eat ice cream. And I joked with him. I told him, "don't eat the entire tub. That's not what the dentist said." He said, "okay, I'll try." So he was excited to watch his football, eat his ice cream. And we spoke up until he got into the apartment. And he said, "okay, I'll talk to you later." And when we hung up, I thought to myself, "why... he didn't tell me he loved me. I'm gonna give him hell the next time we speak." The night of September 6th, It felt like anything else. And then I get a call from my neighbor who said, "hey, man, are you home?" I said, "well, no, I'm down the street." He said, "well, you can't get in." I said, "what happened?" he said, "somebody got shot." It's not common to hear shots around here Because we're 500 feet from the police station. Use the phone! And so once I came home, We couldn't get in because the police had it blocked off. I seen chaos. I seen a lot of cops. I seen a lot of ambulances. They're not sharing information, so we didn't have a clue. And so it was like, "hey, man, maybe a couple was arguing Or maybe there was a bad drug deal." There was a lot of theories. No one really knew what was going on. But then a couple of people came down who had video. Everyone who heard the shot came out into the courtyard To see what was going on. And that's how the video was taken. It's a video of a person being carried out on a gurney. Everyone that I know heard two shots back to back, But we didn't know. Get some crime-scene tape Up here on the fourth floor. Is someone bringing the crime-scene tape? I was asleep, and my phone rang. I looked over, and it was 214 area code. And I thought, "wait, that's texas." I said, "that can't be good." And it was a social worker from the hospital. She asked me if I know botham jean. I said, "yes, he's my brother." She said he was brought in To the emergency room with a gunshot wound. So I said, "I don't understand what you're saying." And she said, "he was shot through his heart, And he died." I was just hearing, like, white noise, Like, it wasn't... Nothing made sense. And my mom was here at the time. I couldn't understand what she meant by "he died." I couldn't... I couldn't understand it. I, you know, I felt that how could he die? It took... A little while for me To really... Grasp what she was saying. I asked her, "where did... Where was he shot?" She said she doesn't know. So I said, "but I don't know that botham keeps bad company." Because I thought maybe he was in the company Of some other people, and he was shot. Was it a stray bullet? Was he out at a restaurant? Was it a robbery? Was it road rage? All sorts of things came to my mind. I got a call from my mom, And she wanted to talk to my dad, So I knew it was bad. And I kept asking my dad, "what happened, what's wrong?" And he just said, "botham." I couldn't muster the courage to tell him... That he had died, But eventually I did. I went to sit in my veranda there just thinking, "how can that be? How can that happen?" I was so traumatic and real. How can that be possible? It was very, very confusing. I couldn't understand what could have happened. I just stayed up checking all the different news networks To see if there would be something on it, But there was nothing. Then I got a message from someone. She works in the apartment building. So I called, And that's when she told me that botham was shot, And she said it was a police officer. Everything was coming at me so fast, I just felt as if my head was in a whirlwind. What we do know Is that an off-duty officer actually killed somebody. Police would not say whether the officer fired Because it was an intruder Or whether it was for some other reason. I first heard about the story when I got into work. Initially, the police were holding back details. There were a lot of things that didn't make sense. The officer was off-duty but still in uniform. We didn't know if the officer was a man or a woman. So we, at that point, are just trying to gather information. So far, police have not identified the officer involved. But for now, that officer is on administrative leave. I had received a phone call and they said, "botham has been shot. He didn't make it." And I was so confused Because, you know, I didn't understand. I called my husband and said, "botham's been killed. I just thought you should know." And he was like, "I'm coming home." And I said, "no, it's fine, just stay at work. There's nothing we can do." And he said, "alexis, your best friend has been called. I'm coming home." Allisa and I flew to dallas that same day. What I was going to do was to get my son And to find out what happened. We didn't know the name of the person who killed my son. When I spoke with the detective, I asked if whoever killed him was arrested and he said no. Police officers have 72 hours to give their statements. Just to know That the person responsible for killing my brother Has 72 hours to give their account of what happened And is still walking free And can still go home and sleep in their bed While my brother was in the morgue Was unsettling for me. It's 72 hours of us Just having questions floating in our mind And it's still 72 hours of us still having to plan a funeral. I needed an attorney. I asked an attorney friend of mine To run some background checks on lee merritt. And soon after they came back, I hired him. I expected the shooter to, at the very least, Be arrested that night, to be interrogated, To be treated like someone who had killed a human. What I learned is the officer hadn't, in fact, been arrested. I was bothered. The department has declined To release the name of the officer Until she is officially charged. It has told us, though, She is a caucasian female patrol officer Who lived in the same apartment complex Where the victim, 26-year-old, botham jean, did. I felt so helpless that my son, Who was so overly cautious, where he went, How he was perceived, Would now be shot. So I wanted to hear exactly what happened. Last night, a female dallas police officer Returned to what she believed to be her apartment After her shift had ended. She was still in uniform When she encountered mr. Jean in the apartment. It's not clear what interaction was between them, Her and the victim, But at some point, she fired her weapon, striking the victim. This is so bizarre. I just cannot understand What was going through this girl's head. I thought... That the officer was drunk Or under the influence of something For mistaking the apartment. And I said, "well, somebody had to be crazy For them to go into the wrong apartment, Put the key in the door and kill somebody." Botham was killed Eating a bowl of ice cream, watching football. That's something that we can all identify with. And the message that the murder of botham jean Sends to the african-american community Is that you're not even safe at home. It really set off a lot of protests in the cities And nationally and internationally. This was a black immigrant man who fought against Every obstacle to come to a new country And establish a life for himself. He was robbed. I prayed for justice for botham. And I specified, "I want whoever is responsible To be charged with murder, to be convicted of murder." - Who are we out here for? - Botham. - Who are we out here for? - Botham. - Who are we out here for? - Botham. Investigators are trying to figure out How the officer entered the apartment And what kind of interaction she had with the victim. I couldn't understand How her key could have opened botham's door. To me, it seemed a little off because I know From when I visited, The key would flash green once it's opened. I thought, "if she put the key in the door To open it and it flashed red, How did she get into the apartment?" The police department questioned If the officer knew botham jean And that became a question that everybody had. On an officer-involved shooting, We do our own investigation. We're separate and distinct from the police. We had a ton of questions. Did she knock on the door? Did he open the door for her? Was the door open? Was the door ajar? Did she have a key? We didn't know if there was a pre-existing relationship Between her and botham. Why would she have used deadly force on somebody Who's just inside their own apartment? Investigators seized jean's cellphone to see If it can explain if he was expecting someone. There was a moment online where people were saying That botham knew his killer. Botham was a worship leader Who sung loudly every morning. And so it was a concern of mine that this woman Who worked long hours Would be annoyed by the singer that lived right above her. When I was there in 2016, Botham told me someone had lodged a noise complaint, So maybe the person was hearing some noise And came up in a rage. The day that botham was shot, There was another complaint. The apartment complex responded to it By going down his apartment floor And knocking on all the doors. He called his friend to say, "I just got home." So he knew that he wasn't playing any music. My second concern was whether or not she was acting As a resource officer For the apartment complex itself, Because there was a history of noise Complaints from his apartment, Whether she had been directed to focus on that apartment. Shortly after the shooting... ...A video surfaced of the officer pacing back and forth. The young woman who recorded it was a young woman Who went by the name of bunny baps. She heard a shot and she began recording, But she didn't know what was happening. After bunny baps uploaded the video to the internet, It went almost instantly viral. I think the video was released to force police To give her name... Because of the lack of information That was being released, There were a lot of rumors that were floating around. #5 botham shem jean lived in the same building. Investigators aren't sure What kind of interaction the two had. There were some suggestions That they were possibly romantically involved. One of the top theories were that they were dating. And he didn't want to be with her anymore and it was over. Someone sent me a photo and said, "look, It's saying that botham had an affair with this person." I'm like, "okay." I didn't know what to believe. We were told this may be a very high profile case, Being a police officer, so I made arrangements to meet At the dallas west church of christ. So the texas ranger, david armstrong, visited us, And he had taken over the case that very same Saturday. The first thing that he said to us Was that once we learned what he knew, We would understand that this was a big, unfortunate mistake. So I said to him, Someone makes a mistake and I lose my son. And that's it? He said there was no ill will or malfeasance. She should not be punished for this crime. This was his impression before he started his investigation. I said, "I don't know in what part of the world That someone kills another person And doesn't get arrested and goes around free." I felt a grave injustice was not only done to my son, But then to me, because you killed my son, You take him away from me And then you're trying to cover up. Having that conversation with david armstrong Made me feel like botham would not get justice. There were marches and protests throughout dallas For several days. Fam, we're at the building Where botham was killed, But that broke dallas police officer. Fam, they got dpd out here to intimidate us. But you can intimidate us, But you can't take care of an officer of yours That's out here killing black men. Uh-oh, uh-oh, they tear-gassing us! Are you serious?! They're tear-gassing us! Oh, my god, no! They're tear-gassing us! Get them out of here. When they released her name and her mug shot, I think everybody kind of breathed For the first time in three days. And I think a lot of people thought, "this is the first step to some sort of justice." We were able to find that amber guyger Was not acting as a resource officer For the apartment complex, And there were no noise complaints from her apartment To his. Immediately, I saw amber's face. It did not match the photo of three ladies and botham. It couldn't be the same person. When I got to know that botham did not know amber guyger, I felt relief. Now we know her name, but we are still waiting On her side of the story as to what happened. We met with the entire family on that Sunday, And the jean family asked If I was aware of the initial encounter Between the responding officers and... and botham. We had been given access to the body-worn cameras... Police! ...And I did let them know that the responding police officers Made extraordinary efforts to save botham's life. The jean family asked me whether or not amber guyger Had provided cpr to botham after she shot him. I could only tell them she had indicated to the police That she had provided cpr. And I also expressed that I had some doubts that it was true. We begin to individually interview all of the officers And we find in-car video that existed at the time. We see that guyger is seated in a police car. You hear some voices, you see what she's doing, And then all of a sudden, the camera goes off. We didn't understand why that video had been turned off. She has no right to have that video turned off, So we began the process of trying to figure out Why was it turned off? On Sunday afternoon, The district attorney asked us to go home And listen to the news because there will be An announcement later on that night. Tonight, the texas rangers released a statement Saying after the initial investigation, A warrant was issued for the police officer. She was arrested on manslaughter charges And later released on bond. It was bittersweet. I was happy she was charged with something, But I was expecting murder. I want you to be dead. I intend you to be dead. I know what I'm going to do is going to cause your death. In texas law, that is a murder. Whether that belief was formed a month before, A day before, a second before, it doesn't matter. A manslaughter means that you are reckless, That what you are doing Is going to cause the death of somebody else. When amber guyger's statement to the texas rangers was released, Her story had changed. Nowhere in this body-cam footage from police officers Who arrived to the scene immediately after the shooting, Is amber guyger to say, "I thought he was coming for me." She left out a critical claim that she later made, Which was, "he was coming for me and I feared for my life." Because in order to use deadly force, It's not even enough that an intruder be present, That person has to represent a threat to you. So along with how she even got into the apartment, The next big question was what was their interaction Before she shot him? I think it's probable that amber guyger Gave the police a rough relay of what happened And that law enforcement began to craft a narrative That was more consistent with the appropriate use For deadly force. We could see that the dash-cam video Had at some point been turned off, But we couldn't see why. It wasn't until later When we received the surveillance video At the apartment complex, We were able to see what happened. Mike mata, The dallas police officers association president, Personally arrived to the scene. He arrived to instruct the other officers to cut off The recording mechanisms at this very critical time. Amber guyger pulled the trigger, But the police department tried to help her cover up that crime. It takes a village to raise a child, But it takes a whole police department to cover up a crime. The first time I saw his body was at the funeral home. I went in. I stood, um, at the entrance... Of the chapel, And I just... I saw a body laying in the casket. And I just couldn't... I just couldn't see him there. Walking into that place, Seeing him, in my heart, it's like, "no." I remember in my head, I was just saying, "no, no," And then I got to him And I was like, "what did they do to you?" My husband and I got to the church And I had no idea. Hundreds of people. And it was in that moment that I was like, "this is how far he has reached." A friend is the family that you choose. - Amen. - Amen. And let me tell you, Botham chose everyone. To most of us we know, He was more than just a friend. He was a brother. He was a son, a confidant, a life coach. He was the guy you called any time you needed anything, And he would show up with a smile. A search warrant describes more of the evidence Collected at botham jean's apartment. The inventory return shows 10.4 grams of marijuana in ziploc bags, One metal marijuana grinder. A common ploy that I often see law enforcement doing... The victim is turned into the villain by the media. We didn't expect it to happen on the day He was being memorialized. And instead breaking in the media Was the smear campaign. To have my son smeared in such a way, I think shows that they are persons Who are going to cover up for the devil, amber guyger Because she was the murderer. That's right. I will not sit back And see that justice does not prevail. That's right. It is time that we recognize that lives matter. My son's life matters. You had law-enforcement officers Investigating botham for criminal activity. You had sources anonymously going to the media. And so you see a whole department Coordinating to help get amber guyger off. Brandt has always been a very quiet child, Jovial but quiet. But after botham's death, brandt got very angry. I punched a couple of doors when I found out. Not just doors, just... I can't remember, a couple stuff. He would be punching the walls, Hitting the walls, And we would come out and I would just hold him And tell him it's gonna be okay. I was 16 when I went to visit him, And botham was 25. When I'm here, I only think of the positive things. I've trained my mind to always think positive And I am applying it everywhere necessary. When brandt came to visit botham, Botham called me and he was crying. He said, "you know, all brandt wants to do Is play video games." And I said, "maybe you should do something he wants to do." So he said, "okay, well, let me try that." We out here. Yeah. It was a really emotional time. He didn't know I cried when he left And I didn't know he cried when I left. I told him, "I love you." He told me, "I love you." I know botham always felt guilty That he left brandt in st. Lucia when botham came to harding. He felt like he didn't give him enough time For them to be together. Having to transition from seeing him alive To seeing him dead, it broke me. They were figuring their relationship out, And then suddenly, he was gone. And brandt took it the hardest. He mourned differently than everyone else. I think the initial charge of manslaughter, You know, didn't really do it. People wanted to see that murder charge. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! Protests happened at a dallas cowboys game, And the attorneys for the family And for the family of o'shae terry, Who was killed by police five days before Botham jean was killed, Met up and walked around with two caskets. We are insisting that a charge of murder be filed. Yeah. It is murder, Because if the roles had been reversed And botham had come into her apartment and killed her, He would be under the jail right now And charged with capital murder. - What do we want? - Justice! I always knew That botham would have to be buried in st. Lucia. Botham was passing through dallas, So we made arrangements to have his body flown. The welcoming we received, I've never seen anybody has received that, Not even the prince or the queen. That just blew me away. Bring tears to my heart. A pouring of love over the entire world. I'm heartbroken That this man was killed in his own apartment, A place where all of us should feel safe, But what gets me most upset is that nothing has changed. I firmly believe that if officer guyger Had walked into that apartment and seen a white man, She would not have pulled that trigger. And that is the root of the problem. What I can say with certainty is that I'm tired of waiting For a time when it's safe to be a black man in america. I was in dallas during the grand jury hearing. It was nerve-racking. Fired dallas police officer amber guyger Indicted on a murder charge today. Guyger's attorneys called the murder charge political And not based on facts. It's a simple self-defense. By law, it's a justified homicide. So there should not be any charges. Murder is the proper charge. People were shocked that she was Only charged with manslaughter. And then I think on the other side, People were shocked that she was indicted for murder. It doesn't mean that the case itself Will be a slam dunk. In fact, we are concerned and we are focused That the criminal trial itself will be anything but. I was happy for it, But I don't want to rejoice in just step one. The police department never released the 911 call 'cause they argued it would interfere with the future trial. We'd all previously filed requests to get copies Of that tape and were denied. In April, a local tv station here, wfaa, Got copies of the 911 tape and they released it. We have new information, Information that's going to give clarity Into what amber guyger was thinking on the night She killed botham jean. It was released anonymously, But because of the quality of the call, it was very clear That it was released from within the department. It knocked the wind out of me and moreso it knocked the wind Out of the family. It seemed that she really did believe That that was her apartment. So for a moment, she became, I think, To a lot of people, this sympathetic person And that she really regretted what had happened. They had a chat room set up And the angle that they went with it was Was amber guyger unfairly targeted? Was she being scapegoated for police brutality in the country? And did this tape show that she was really a sincere victim? At work, I played the call again And again and again. I thought I heard him. And it just... It wrecked me. It wrecked me, I was sent home because I just... I broke down. It was very hard to listen to, But that call angered me because what I heard Was someone who was all about herself. I didn't hear whether he's conscious, Are you applying pressure on the wound? Are you giving him cpr? Nothing that suggests that There was any concern for my son. We were preparing for a very difficult trial And suddenly the narrative was being shifted towards sympathy For amber guyger as opposed to sympathy for her victim. Who's amber guyger is a question we all had. Initially, as we were trying to find her on social media And ran into a lot of roadblocks. There was no social media presence for her. It appeared that she had scrubbed her social media, But she did not take down her pinterest. Amber guyger says, "I got my gun and a shovel and gloves "if I were you back the off And get out of my ass." A lot of people have thought that that showed She didn't have value for human life. I saw the one about The nfl suffering from colon cancer. So what came to my mind was, Okay, she was racist. There was a point where I just wanted her to die. I hated her completely. He played "call of duty" And he would stay in his room for long hours. I was always very concerned that with the anger he was displaying And that game which is shooting, shooting all the time, That he would want to take revenge for his brother. You could tell the prosecution Wasn't that confident about winning. They came to us and they said There's a plea deal being discussed, But we really want you all to impress upon the family How difficult it's gonna be to get a conviction In this case. That was a low point because I felt like I was marching the family toward a trial Where an officer will be acquitted, Which is typically the pattern. I read almost every article that came out Related to both them, And I saw that it was very difficult for a police officer To be convicted for murder. The system was against me. Also, she was female. And based on what I've read, there is white privilege. So I was very nervous leading up to the trial. I felt that the odds were against me. Amber guyger had gone out of her way To make herself the damsel in distress. Her hair was being worn down. All her features were made softer. This case presented a problem that you don't often see. This was a young, pretty, white woman. And so, I was concerned That they would have a difficult time convicting her. In order for us to prevail in this case, We needed to prove that amber guyger intentionally Or knowingly caused the death of botham jean In dallas county, texas, on September 6, 2018, That was the easy part. We also have to disprove whatever justifications Or defenses that the defendant puts in front of the jury. They could be self-defense. State, make an opening argument. This is botham shem jean. On September the 6th of 2018, The evidence is going to show you that he was sitting In his living room In shorts and a t-shirt, watching tv, Eating a bowl of vanilla ice cream. When all of a sudden, Amber guyger comes through his front door, Uninvited, the light from the hallway Must've flooded his apartment, The noise from the door must've scared him to death. But I really wanted to know, How did amber guyger got into botham's apartment? They recently had the doors replaced, They kind of did it on the cheap and the locks didn't match up. And it slammed, If it was particularly wet or humid outside The door sometimes would bounce back A little bit or wouldn't fully engage. The evening of the shooting, it had been raining. And so, when amber guyger testified That she put her key in, She was able to push that door open In a way that she should not have been. Then she said she encounters Botham who's coming at her aggressively. We knew that it just wasn't true. And we needed the jury to be crystal clear That she had the choice, she alone was gonna control Whether or not botham lived or died. And she chose a course of action that pretty much guaranteed He was gonna die right there. The day amber guyger testified, My heart was racing, My legs were bouncing, I was just so anxious Because I'm looking this person in her eyes for the first time. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you will give Will be the truth, the whole truth And nothing but the truth, so help you god? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you, please sit. I was angry when I saw her. When the defense was questioning her, I thought that everything She was saying was all rehearsed. Why'd you want to be a police officer? I just wanted to help people And that was the one career That I thought I could help people in. The defense was really trying to go after the fact That she really believed that she was in her apartment. If she thought that there was somebody in her apartment Who was going to harm her, Then they argued that she had the right to do what she did. I looked over at the jury and they were crying with her And that was scary. And so I was concerned That they would have a difficult time convicting her After seeing her on the stand Be so vulnerable. Making herself out to be a damsel in distress, I believe was a part of the defense. It was important to point out That she wasn't all virtue. Today amber guyger was questioned About her relationship With her police partner, martin rivera. Turns out they were having an affair. When jason hermus brought up the sexting With the married police partner, I thought that it was very good for the chances of a conviction. Our investigation revealed that amber guyger and martin rivera Had had a personal relationship On top of their professional relationship And we believe that martin rivera Was incredibly important to amber. As far as martin rivera... Did that develop into a sexual relationship? Yes, it did. Did you not want people to know? - I did not. - Why? I was embarrassed 'cause he was married. The affair had been going on for at least two years. Mr. Rivera testified that they had cut it off For the last couple of months, But it was pretty clear from the text messages, Both that were recovered And the images that were deleted, That they were planning on having sex that night. Amber guyger left the police station. She was texting with martin rivera About them meeting up. Somewhere in between her getting in her car And her getting out of the car at the apartment parking lot, It seems like the plans changed. There's a period that's unaccounted for Where she pulled off in the parking lot... ...And there was a telephone conversation That lasted 10 minutes. Maybe he canceled on her and she was upset about it. So she stopped to really argue with him And then started driving. But at that point, she's upset. Someone testified that she was driving fast And didn't even realize She skipped the third floor, her floor. She got off on the wrong floor Just because she wanted to have an affair. So it could be that gap changed her mood. She was upset, so she decided, you know what? There's a burglar in there. I'm just gonna go and kill him. If martin riviera had met her that night, My son would've been alive today. The police department was close. So if she felt threatened, She could have called for backup And the police could've gotten there in less than two minutes. The police department protocol is You need to call for backup. Why wasn't that followed? Probably could've saved botham's life if you had followed that. And that's the biggest thing for me. Why did you go inside, If that's what the protocol calls for? I bought her story to the point of yes, She thought it was her apartment, But I did not buy her story From the moment she opened the door. From that moment on, I don't believe anything she said. What happened was I put the key into the key... the lock. I see that it's cracked open. And at the same time, I'm hearing this moving around, But me putting that key... The key fob into the lock, It's pushing the door open. Self-defense justification was the first landmine That says there are certain situations Where officers are allowed to use deadly force. And she began to paint a picture of her behaving As a police officer, issuing verbal commands. And botham jean as the noncompliant black man. I saw this silhouette figure Standing in the back of the apartment by the window. There were no verbal commands because I know my brother. I know if there were, he would comply Because we would have conversations about stories Like this all the time. He knew the kind of world we lived in. He wanted to survive. I pulled my gun out and I yelled at him. It's like, "let me see your hands. Let me see your hands." I do not believe for one second that botham Would go after a police officer. He told me, so, as a black man in america, You do not walk into a store with your hands in your pockets. People are gonna believe what they want And you just want to stay away from that. And that's what he told me. I have my gun pointed and I'm saying, "let me see your hands, let me see your hands." Him. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, sir. And that's at that point whenever I shot once. Part of what she said was that botham represent a threat. All the evidence, the physical evidence, seems to indicate That botham was sitting on his couch Eating a bowl of ice cream. As bo was trying to get up off the couch To find out what this intruder is doing coming into his home, She's leveling off her guard, having acquired her target And she shoots at him twice. One shot took a very unusual pathway through his body, Entering just above his left nipple And going almost straight down Until it came to a rest in his lower back area. He was in a football position Suggesting that he was just getting up from the couch. That's why the bullet went from the top of his heart Right down to the bottom. Bullets don't go straight and then go down. The bullet trajectory directly contradicted The statements of amber guyger That botham represented a threat, That he was moving towards her. And so, we felt pretty good about that. I thought two things about amber guyger. I thought that she was incredibly self-centered. She saw herself as the victim in this circumstance. I also thought amber guyger would be honest. So you knew when you were shooting that gun That you were using deadly force Against mr. Jean? Yes, it was a threat at the time. Ma'am, will you answer my questions, please? Yes, sir. When you shot mr. Jean, You knew you were using deadly force against him? Yes. So it was all good and well for her To just replay what was rehearsed When it came to a defense team. But when the prosecution cross-examined her, She was cornered. When you aimed and pulled the trigger At mr. Jean shooting at center mass, Exactly where you are trained, You intended to kill mr. Jean? - I did. That was the one piece of evidence That we had to get from her. After she pulled the trigger, She text martin rivera. All of their text messages were deleted Before they turned them in for the investigation. The text messages that we were able to recover says, "I need you." "I f'd up." I know that she was sending and receiving text messages In that short period of time, I know that she was speaking on a phone. I don't know if she had it on speaker phone or not. It's hard to be a damsel in distress when instead Of helping the person who's bleeding out on the ground, You're texting the partner that you're having an affair with While he's lying there dying. Then they show footage of botham being wheeled out, So he was still being worked on while she was texting. Did you see that, ms. Guyger? No, I did not. What happened just outside your window? Can we play it again? - Yes, please. I looked at my phone 'cause I didn't want to see his body. It looks like you're trying text somebody again, right? I just... I looked down at my phone. I don't know what I was doing. She's not crying after she committed this crime. And it just seemed like it's business as usual. How long has this remorse that what you've been doing is wrong? How long did that last? A day or two? It lasted every day. So as this family is thinking about having to bury their son And their brother, two days after the event, You are already going back to talking about getting drunk And doing sexual things with martin rivera. Yes, I did. I felt like she knew That people were going to try to cover this up for her. She was going to get away with this. It's not black or white When it comes to the police department. They don't see the race. It's just blue. Once you take that oath, to me, it's like joining a cult Or joining a gang, they protect their own. At this time, it is my responsibility To read to the jury instructions. We believe that we tried a very solid case And we were confident That the jury was going to find the defendant guilty. So it was a surprise and it caused us A huge amount of concern When the judge allowed the castle doctrine. It is almost impossible for the state To overcome that and get a conviction. The castle doctrine is texas's version Of stand your ground. She should not have been afforded the defense Because she wasn't home and it wasn't reasonable for her To assume that she was in her home Because there were clear indications That she was in the wrong place. We were very worried. The jury, when they went off to deliberate, It was hard. We just had to sit and wait For their decision. It was nerve-racking. When the jury finally reached a decision, Walking to the courtroom, I felt like I was underwater. I couldn't hear anything going on around me. It was just... It felt like just unreal. Police officers start to come in And line the wall And I'm just praying and we're all quiet. I'm bouncing my knees because it's just... And the jury comes in, And the judge, and she read... Ms. Guyger and your team, would you please stand? We, the jury, unanimously find the defendant, amber guyger, Guilty of murder as charged in the indictment. No outbursts. I was just... In awe. So the first person that I had to praise is god. It was just a lot of joy, it was powerful joy, You know, like, kind of standing on a mountain. Screaming and shouting and praising god Type of joy. First, I felt like a weight was lifted, But immediately after I felt This sense of loss Because I just wanted my brother back In that moment. I felt like, you know, once you get to the end, Like, you get back... I wasn't sure I heard it right. I was blown away. It was a huge moment of relief. I believe that history was made with this conviction. I've looked, but I've never seen a white female police officer Convicted for the murder of a black male. This was a major victory. My mother, she's different. She cries a lot. Bertrum, I would describe him as just a shell. It's like the light behind his eyes are off. He's... he's not the same. And how has this affected brandt? Hmm. Brandt is... Another shell. He has always been a quiet person, But he's even more quiet. And I'm worried about brandt. This morning, did you learn that joe had been Sexually molesting her? Yes, ma'am. And was joe eventually arrested for indecency with a child With amber being the main victim? Yes, ma'am. People began to humanize her and sort of defuse The anger of her killing this man in his home, And so, I was concerned about the level of sympathy That she was beginning to receive. The jury having reached a verdict, I will now announce it. We, the jury, assess the defendant's punishment At 10 years imprisonment In the texas department of criminal justice. I felt... The same way I felt When we buried botham. I felt like we put him in the ground all over again With just 10 years. That was a slap in the face. I was angry about the sentence, very angry, But I did not show it. I expected 30, 40, But not 10. So I did think botham's life Was worth more than that, way more than that. No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! People outside the courtroom went into protest mode Because it was unfair. - What do we want? - Justice! - When do we want it? - Now! At first, I didn't want to do that impact statement Because I felt like if you've killed my brother already, There's nothing I could do that would bring him back. But when I was asked, my grandmother touched my hand And she said to me, it's her soul that matters. And that's why I-I... Had to come up here. I know he was angry and the walls Are lined with police officers all armed. So I was scared. I didn't know what he was gonna say. Our concerns were that he was going to show spit And venom and anger and hostility. We didn't know if he was gonna lash out Or run at the defendant. We didn't know what to expect. I don't want to... Say twice or for the hundredth time What you've or how much you've taken from us, I think you know that. But I just... I hope you... Go to god with all... With all the guilt, All the things, the bad things you may have done in the past. Each and every one of us may have done something That we're not supposed to do. If you truly are sorry, I know I can speak for myself, I-I forgive you. And... I know if you go to god and ask him, He will forgive you. And I don't think anyone can say it, again, I'm speaking for myself, not even bad for my family, But I love you just like anyone else. And I'm not gonna say I hope you rot and die Just like my brother did, But I see I-I, personally, want the best for you And I wasn't gonna ever say this in front of my family Or anyone, but... I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you. Because I know that's what... that's exactly What botham want you to do, And the best would be give your life to christ. I don't know if it is possible, But can I give her a hug, please? Please? Yes. I saw surprise in her face, And she was just in awe, like, what is this? It felt like she was seeing a miracle. And I'm trying to process what's going on, But at the same time, I'm like, How would botham feel about this? I don't know. I was so in awe of him Because he showed forgiveness. I couldn't do that. He did what we couldn't do. I was mortified. This would mean this family would be pariahs Among the activist community because they were out for blood. If the family demonstrate to the public, "I'm not really suffering, I'm okay. I'm concerned with her suffering." Then what was all this effort for? Why were there millions of people all over the world Ready to protest? And then, it sort of clicked for me that if he could do it, The person had lost the most, like, grieved the hardest, Then who was I to withhold humanity from her? Brandt's decision to hug and express forgiveness toward Guyger sparked an enormous reaction, Much of it expressed on social media. It was the hug heard round the world And everyone was talking about brandt. Why black people being called upon to forgive serially? So in other words, we commend black people For being moral heroes While we declined to treat them as human beings. The police department who try to use this Very sincere act of forgiveness As a means of buffering their irresponsibility To our community. It started instantly Just everyone on social media saying, You know, we supported this family from day one And this is how they thank us. In that courtroom, I said what I said because I cared about her soul. You know, I'm proud of doing it and I'll do it again. I told him I was proud of him To get to that point. Forgiveness is not for the other person, it's for you. Forgiveness is freeing. For him to be at that stage, I almost envy him because He gets to... Just be free. And... I'm far from that. Well, each person have their own opinion. I lost my son, none of them lost their son Except bertrum and I. And I even find it's different because I bore him. He came from my womb. I know what I lost. I know how it feels To lose a child. When I first came here, I could see on botham's face That he felt comfortable being here And he loved it so much. I have a little home away from home feeling. What about you? Not so much. It's always bittersweet being here Because he's not here. So you do feel the void. To me, it's not a home away from home. Ooh, I didn't know you were here today, hey. - Good to see you guys. - Hi, how are you? Ooh. Hi, good morning. How are you? Good, how are you? Well, surprise, surprise. It's good to see everybody. We're gonna start off with a song. Then we'll come back with a prayer. - Good morning. - Good morning. Hymn number 490, "to canaan's land, I'm on my way." Botham was the first one to hear it. He heard me in the shower, And he was like, "you know, this song? "'to canaan's land I'm on my way'? I heard you, so let's sing it." And then, we just sang the entire song together. He gave me the courage to do it. And every time my confidence just builds, More and more. It reminds me that he's always with me And he will always be with me no matter what. Amen. This is botham's suitcase they took in dallas With some of his clothing. I want to feel him, so I wear some of his clothing. So I took only the shirts because he's such a huge guy And the shoes couldn't fit me. But despite being so big, extra large, I still wear them to go to church every Sunday. So I have some lovely colors there And even the one on me as well. My office is not too far away, actually, I can stay on to the front of my office onto the steps And look across there and see this tomb. So when I look across, It just breaks my heart. Not in my wildest dream, I would ever believe botham would be here. I just miss him, yeah. Yeah. Who could...
