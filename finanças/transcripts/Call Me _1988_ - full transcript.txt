[ subway car rattling ] [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] Woman, on answering machine: You've reached 627-2363. After you hear the tone, leave your name and any message. I'll call you back. [ beep ] [ click ] [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] Hello? Hello? Hello? Man: Hi. Who's this? Man: Uh...oh... [ chuckles ] Alex. - What? - Very funny. How come you never sound like this when we're together? I... I want you. Oh, that's a change. You want me. Now? On the telephone? What was wrong with last night? Or the night before? Or the past four weeks? I wanna fuck you. Alex. I'd like to rub my cheek against your thigh. You would? If only I could... touch you. Are you wet? Of course I'm wet. You just got me out of the shower. - Alex? - I want you. I want you right now. I could come over. No. We'll meet. At the Polish Bar in an hour. Dress... nice. I want to see your thighs. And leave your panties at home. You could take them off. No panties. [ music playing on jukebox ] Hi. [ Polish accent ] Oh. You're the lady who did the story. - Anna. - Yeah. I think you look different today. On the house... for putting us in "Voice Of The City." Thank you. [ door shuts ] What's this? Eau de vie. It's very nice. You have a flaw. In one of your eyes. No one usually notices. It's... very beautiful. Are you waiting for someone? I'm meeting someone. Are you? [ ringing ] [ ring ] Man: Hello? Alex, where are you? What do you mean where am I? I'm home, obviously. Well, aren't you coming? I've been here for 45 minutes already. Been where? At the Polish Bar. That place you wrote about? What are you doing there? Waiting for you... without my panties. [ laughs ] Why? Because you told me to. I did? Don't try to pretend it wasn't you. Alex, you did call me and... And what? Oh, God. Anna? Anna, are you okay? What a jerk I am. What? I... Forget it. Listen, I gotta go. I'll come over, okay? Oh, okay. Look, uh... why don't I meet you at your place? All right, but be there. I'm leaving right now. [ door opens ] Okay. [ sighs ] You jerk. Hey. Good work, Nikki. See you later. Okay. Nice tie. Hey! [ shouting ] This is the ladies' room! Well, I don't see any ladies here! Nikki knows what you want, so why don't you come on on over here and she'll give it to you? - No way! - Ow! Where's the fucking money? Uhh! Aah! Aah! You fucking bitch! Don't hurt me! Aah! Goddamn bitch! Where's the money? - [ thud ] - Aah! [ stall door opens ] [ faucet running ] [ door slams shut ] [ gasps ] [ gasps ] Taxi! Taxi! [ footsteps approaching ] [ thud ] Where've you been? Where are you going? Look at you. What happened? Where you in a fight? Sort of. What do you mean, sort of? I saw a murder. A murder? Where? At the Polish Bar. In the women's toilet. What were you doing there? I was going to the bathroom! I was in the stall, and this women cut this guy. And he killed her. He just threw her in the next stall, and he kept smashing her. It was awful, Alex. I could hear it. You saw it or you heard it? The whole fucking stall was shaking! I thought it would collapse. I had to spend the whole time squatting, like this. And then her body fell. Her arm... Her voice changed, and her arms flipped under my stall. She had on this charm bracelet... and these red nails. And the money. There was blood everywhere. What money? The money she stole from him. Here. Here. This money. It was a 50. I used it to pay the cab. Maybe she was just unconscious. She was dead, Alex! She was dead. I think it was a he. You don't know if it was a man or a woman? I didn't stop to check. Anna, this could be serious. Maybe we should call the cops. I can't. It was a cop who killed her. How do you know that? I saw his badge. What, did he take it out and show it to you? No, it fell on the floor! Jesus, what are you trying to do to me? I see a murder-- a murder. I come home, and what do I get? Nothing. As usual. What the fuck were you doing in there tonight? You set me up! Fuck you I set you up! Kick his ass. Uhh! Hey, what the fuck are you doing, man? Come on. Shit. You okay, Jelly? Good. He's okay. Where's the money? He's still got it! I haven't got it. The girl's got it. She didn't have it! Don't lie to me, fuck! I searched her! Not here. The other one. The real one. What other one? You were too busy bashing that queen's brains in to notice. Don't bullshit me, Jelly! Why would I bother? Am I supposed to believe this? How are we going to continue to enjoy the fruits and benefits of our friendship with the police if we don't remunerate them for their service? [ cocks gun ] You saw what happened to that transvestite. If you play those games with me, you're gonna end up the same way! You and that cracked-up sidekick of yours. Yeah. Maybe you took it. Fuck you, dickbrain. - Fuck you. - Yeah, come on. - Come on. Let's go. - Hey, hey. You're dead. Put it away, Switch. What? Put it away. Put him away. He's a rude motherfucker. I'll take care of this. Big man. I'm gonna fucking stick that cop. You watch, man. [ sighs ] I gotta find that girl. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. I heard the screaming. Oh, God, Anna. Did you call the cops? What did they say? They wanted me to leave my name and number. And? I didn't. Oh, good. A cop did it. A cop did it. How do you get yourself into these situations? This is incredible. This is like the time-- Cori, you sound just like Alex. God forbid. [ sighs ] I assume you told Mr. Wonderful. Yes. He was his usual, comforting self. I'm sure. Look, there's nothing you can do about this. You just have to put it out of your mind, no matter how horrible it is, okay? I can still see the hand and the blood. Anna, don't dwell on it. It's just another awful New York story. That happened to someone else. [ inaudible dialogue ] Hey. They bought the idea. For what? Ooh, this smells great. You must have been working on this a long time. Alex, they bought the idea for what? Fast-foods. My idea about international junk foods. Yeah. I'm gonna get a free trip around the world to write about fast-food restaurants. You know, Pizza Hut in Paris, Burger King in Bangkok. It's gonna be great. They're sending you around the world? Yeah, I leave next Friday. Oh. I gotta meet my publisher in an hour for dinner. They want me to do a chapter on airline food. You know, like sushi in JAL, caviar, airflows. You get the idea. Yeah, I get the idea all right. Hey, it's only for a month...or two. Alex, I don't want you to go. I can't turn this down. No, no, I mean tonight. I don't want to be alone here tonight. Since when do you mind being alone? You're always telling me not to come over. Since someone called pretending to be you. Pretending to be me? What did he say? He said... It was an obscene phone call. And that's why you thought it was me? Why didn't you just hang up? 'Cause I thought it was you. It sounded like you, a lot. Come on. Maybe I just wished it was you. Maybe it was. Oh! You never believe a word I say. Look, it's not that I don't believe you, it's just-- Just what? Well, you got to admit, it sounds a little improbable . He just happens to call just when I happen to be leaving town? I don't just think up little ploys just to keep you around. Besides, you wouldn't have the wit to think of an obscene phone call. Yes, I would. [ faucet running ] Hello. I have a collect call for you. I'm not accepting the charges. I better run. Alex? I'll call you later, okay? I'm sure you will. [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] Hello? Man: Hi. Oh, hi. I'm glad you called. I'm sorry about before. I'm okay now. Good. I thought you might not want to talk to me. No, I-- Where are you? What are you doing? Where am I? I'm in my apartment, wondering who keeps calling me pretending he's Alex! What about my question for "Street Smarts?" Um, what question? On sexual harassment at the office? [ chuckles ] It's been done. With good reason. Yeah. Well, uh... why don't you find something a little more exciting? What could be more exciting than sexual harassment? Like what, high-top sneakers again? I would do another column on sleazy bars. They're not sleazy, they're crossover. Depends on your taste, Anna. Yeah, it does. How about sexual harassment at home? Just a coffee. Here we go. "Two divorced ladies looking for refined, cultured gentlemen." Huh? What do you say? These fucking people trying to get it on. They make me laugh, you know? I wouldn't let them eat out my garbage can. They're probably all losers. "GWM. "SJF. DWF." What's that? Dumb white fuck? "Tall beautiful woman." Transvestite. Weird fucks. Hey, why don't we put an ad in here? Hmm? An ad? Yeah. For the chick. The chick. So we can find her. "Sweetheart, "I met you at the Polish Bar. "You stole more than my heart. P.S.: Please bring the money." That's a great idea. It's inspired. Well, uh, you know, maybe not that obvious. What does she look like anyway? She has a... tight mouth. Tight ass. Tight red shoes. Say, where did you, uh... where did you come by this, um... this new ensemble? Do you like it? You know, on 14th Street. I want to find her, man. I want to find her, fast. I'll take care of it. Well, you should... or I will. Hi. Oh, hi! I brought some wine. Can I get a corkscrew? I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay. What are you having? Spaghetti aglio olio, artichoke hearts with garlic dressing-- Oh! Vinny, can I have an order of garlic bread, please? [ laughs ] Come on. Why don't you just wear it around your neck? I don't mind the occasional vampire, I just like garlic. [ exhales ] Do you know what you want? Uh, I'll have some minestrone soup. And how's Alex? He'll live. He's about to take off on a trip around the world. He's got a contract to do a book on international junk food. You're kidding! Oh, go with. I would. I don't want to. Why not? It sounds like fun. It's Alex's project, It's Alex's money, and it's Alex's trip. Yeah. A humor writer without a sense of humor. Besides, I'd just end up being another piece of luggage. Apollonia, I had a garlic bread. Mm-hmm. So what's the difference? It's better to be a piece of luggage in Paris than in Brooklyn. Cori. How long are you going to hang on with this guy? Cori. I'm sorry. It's a sore subject, I know, but I just don't see how you continuer it. 'Cause it's easier than ending it. Well, that's not a very good reason. Did you have another fight? No. Yes, but that's not why. I got an obscene phone call. Oh! Two, from the same guy. I get them all the time. All you gotta do is tell 'em they're shit, whistle or scream into the phone and hang up. I guess I could change my number. But then no one would know how to reach me. Yeah, well, that's the point. What if he knows me? [ gasps ] You think it's someone you know? At first I thought it was Alex. Trying to liven things up. Something like that. But now I'm not so sure. I think it might be this guy from the Polish Bar. This guy from where? This guy who tried to pick me up. He's really good-looking, in a sort of dangerous way. What does he say, I mean, on the phone? Oh, the usual. What, S and M, bestiality, golden showers, what? It's a really sexy voice. You want to listen. [ telephone rings ] [ rings ] [ rings ] Hello? Man: Hi. You're home. Stop calling me! [ answering machine clicks ] [ beep ] [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] [ clicks ] Anna: You've reached 627-2363. After you hear the tone, leave your name and any message. I'll call you back. [ beep ] Man: I know you're there, and I think you want to talk to me. You'd like to, wouldn't you? Where are you? Are you on the bed? Are you lying down? I'd like to lie down beside you. I love your shoulders. And your eyes. How do you know what I look like? I... I imagine it. Well, imagine this. I saw a murder and it's your fault. So I don't have time for you and your third-rate porno! [ telephone rings ] [ rings ] [ rings ] [ rings ] [ rings ] Look, you're not getting the message. There's no point in calling. I have nothing to say to you. Man: It was my fault. It happened at the Polish Bar, you stupid jerk! In the women's toilet! Is that kinky enough for you? If it wasn't for your stupid idea of a joke, I wouldn't have been there in the first place! Are you okay? Are you in trouble? How did you see it? Anna: I was in the right place at the right time. Man: Do you know who did it? - Yes. - Who? A cop. Did you see him? I saw his badge. Did he see you? No. [ sighs ] Good. Then you're safe. Now, sit down and tell me the story. Guess who! Cori! Hi! [ laughs ] Alex, how very wonderful to see you again. Alex, do you know Bill Boyden? No, I don't think so. Hi. Alex Harris, the whack world of humor. I heard about your new book. Let's not have lunch. We won't. Listen, we're going to the aquarium. Want to come? Oh, I can't. I promised Alex a hot dog to help him with his street spots. So what's the question this week? What would you do if you received an obscene phone call? You got to be kidding? Who would answer that question? Oh, I would. You're compromising . No, I'd answer 'em. I wouldn't encourage him too much. Sweetheart. Look in "The Voice" next week. What about you, Bill? I don't know. I never got one. Fred? Come on, Anna. What kind of a guy do you take me for? Did you ever make one? Ooh. What, is that a hint? What about gay obscene phone calls? Oh, gee. Why, Alex? Been getting some recently? No, Alex has been making them. You know what I mean. They usually make them to women. Oh. I mean, if you think of women getting them. It might be a good idea for a piece. Gosh! Wouldn't that be a good idea? That's what Anna's doing right now, Alex. Good thinking. Let's get a hot dog. I'll see you later. Cori: Okay. Bye. Anna, where are you? I read "Street Smarts." Why that particular question? You don't like it? No, no, no, I liked. It's, uh, different. Well, does that mean you are or you aren't gonna use it? Well, let's put it this way. Uh... In two days, when the paper comes out, every weirdo in town's gonna be dialing your number. Including you? Ooh! What's that supposed to mean? Would you make an obscene phone call? To you? To anyone. Do I look like the type? I don't know. What does the type look like? I asked a couple of people if they worry about food too much. I mean, it's a joke. What is this after all? It's just vitamins, packaging. It all comes out the same way. What's it matter how it goes in? That's great. I'm going to Boston tomorrow. What is it this time, baked beans? You're leaving on Friday. I know. I have to. [ reggae playing on boom box ] [ Jamaican accent ] Let's go, baby. You gonna dance with me. Come on. We do our thing. - Get out of here. - No, come on now. - Give me back my bag. - No! Give me back my bag! Give me back my bag, you jerk! Don't fuck with me, bitch! Are you all right? It's okay. Yeah, I'm okay. Hey, aren't you the lady from the Polish Bar? Are you all right? I hope it wasn't your fault. I never got your name. Alex: Anna! Jesus, what happened? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's the guy. What guy? From the bar. The caller. Alex: Where? He was right here. Come on. Let's just get out of here. Are you sure it was him? I was talking to him. Come on. [ gasps ] Bill. What happened to your eye? Toaster popped up too hard. Uh-huh. Well, how you doing otherwise? Okay. What are you doing? Nothing much. You want some company? I don't really feel like talking. We could walk. Sure. [ pop ] What the hell was that? They're party favors, from my niece's birthday. [ pop ] Would you mind playing with them somewhere else? I'm really not in the mood. From your niece's birthday party? Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. What do you want to see me about? You find the girl? Huh? I don't even know what the fuck she looks like, man. You know how many girls in the city wear red shoes? [ loud bang ] No, I didn't find her We gotta find her, man. Oh, yeah. She's dangerous. She knows too much. [ loud bang ] What does she know? Maybe she didn't do it. What do you mean? What if somebody else did it? Man, she did it. She was right there. Are you kidding me? Who else is gonna do it? [ sighs ] The one with the balls. She didn't have it on her. We searched her. [ sighs ] Maybe she passed it to somebody else. I didn't think of that. One thing I know. The lady didn't do it. We're not gonna know for sure until we find her, right? Where you going? Where you going, Jell? You gonna call me-- Man: You picked up. I'm glad. Anna: Yeah. I should know better than to answer my own phone. Man: You want to talk to me. You get something from it. [ chuckles ] Yeah. That's why I keep the machine on all the time. That's why you pick up. You want to listen. You want to hear me teasing you so bad, you grab my cock between-- Yeah, maybe my tits aren't big enough. Did you ever think of that? [ man laughs ] Don't you have a credit card? There are women who do this for a living, you know? They're a lot better at it than I am. They don't do it because they like to. [ laughs ] You think I like this? If this is your idea of a turn-on, forget it. The phone is the closest you'll ever get. Maybe that's as close as you want to get. How's your eye? How'd you know about that? You were there, weren't you? You're him. I wasn't anywhere. Then how'd you see my eye? You told me about it. No, I didn't. Now, I wanna know who the fuck you are. Uhh! So, where's the money, Jelly? Where's the money? I bought an IRA. Ask my broker. Don't fuck with me, Jelly! Where is this broad that you can't find? Or maybe you found her already. Who was that at the park? That was someone else. Passing acquaintance. [ cocks gun ] When you find her-- When I find her, you'll be the first to know. Good. Anna? Oh, you got the proofs. Yeah. This time tomorrow morning, ever pervert in New York is gonna know your name. I think they already do. Anything cut? Not a word. We used everything. That's a change. So, uh, what did you say your number was, hmm? I think you already know it. Well, I should...by now. [ chuckles ] [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] [ ring ] [ ring ] You've reached 627-2363. After you hear the tone, leave your name and any message. I'll call you back. [ beep ] Man: I know you're there listening. Aren't you? I need to talk to you. I want to... You been smoking that shit again? No. [ sneezes ] Hey, they put the ad in there? Check the back page. I put an ad in for the chick. You put an ad in? Yeah. Why? For the chick. Forget the ad. We don't need an ad. Why? What? Why? You gonna tell me why or what? It's all right. I like talking to myself. Anna! Hi. Hi. Let me see your shiner. Okay. - You ready? - Yeah. Aah! Oh, my God! It's beautiful! I would put a little more yellow in there, though. [ laughs ] So is this where it happened? - Yeah. - What? I went in and looked. - Did you really? - Yeah. At what? Nothing. Excuse me. I want to ask you a question. Why isn't my picture in "Street Smarts?" Because this is a family paper. Hey, I am family, okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Typical family-- "Genital warts subjects wanted." Uh-huh. "Diarrhea research clinic in New York City "will pay you $50 to test new medication at home. "Save this ad. Transvestite boutique. Extra-large sizes available." Oh, isn't that where Alex shops? Cori! Oh, here. Here's one. "Please support my film about a man who eats to vomit--" [ laughs ] Eww! "Will send script." I'll be right back. Someone was here, asking about you. Today? Who? No, a couple of days ago. He wanted to know if you come here regular. What did he look like? Was he kind of handsome? What kind of clothes did he have on? Nice suit. Expensive. Not the guy for you. I don't believe this. What? Oh, my God. Anna. Look at this. Where is it? Here. "To the beautiful lady in the red shoes at the Polish Bar. "One drink. I wanted to get to know you better. "You stole more than my heart. Call me. Box C-178." That's him! Look. "Call me." Yeah. So? So you don't call a box number, you write to it. We got to get out of here. Why? How come? Because. Of what? Just because, okay? Let's go. Cori: Anna! What? What do you want? Get in. I want to talk to you. Oh, yeah? Move over. Go ahead, move over. You talked to me enough. And stop following me, you jerk! Do you know who he is? I've been getting these unusual phone calls lately, and I think he's the caller. Why would he follow you around, then? I mean, if he's calling you, and he knows your name, he must know where you live. I don't think he does know my name. Well, I still don't see why he'd follow you if he was calling. Neither do I. It's a little scary. See, the thing is, on the phone, he's not so creepy. He makes obscene phone calls. That sounds pretty sleazy to me. I said creepy not sleazy. He probably is a sleaze. I'm sure he's a sleaze. I'm going in. Anna. You all right? Yeah. Thanks. I'm surprised. Yeah, me, too. I'll see you later. [ telephone rings ] [ ring ] Man: Hi. Why are you following me? Following you? I've never followed you. If someone is, it's not me Why should I? All I have to do is call. Listen, if you don't want to talk to me, hang up right now. I'll never call you again. Do you have a name? What's taking so long? Maybe you don't want to find her. Some will say maybe you took the money. Let me ask you a question. Who do you think would be more likely to pull a stunt like this? Me or some cop who's on the take? He wants us to think that she took the money. What about Switchblade? [ chuckles ] It's impossible. If it doesn't involve a knife, he can't cut it. Then you better find this girl, and if she doesn't-- even if she does have the money, take her out. Hmm. Can you recommend a good restaurant? Just give her to Switch! I'll take care of it. So he called you again? Yeah. Did you tell him to fuck off? Cori, I'm not the only woman who gets obscene calls. Well, you're the only one I know who talks to them. I don't know about this purple. No, it's good. You gotta go with your assets, even if they are temporary. It's just... I think he likes talking to me. [ chuckles ] Funny. It's almost as if I don't want to hang up. Do you know he called last night just to tell me a story? He's a mystery. [ sighs ] You know, Anna, if you want this guy to stop following you, you're gonna have to stop having conversations with him. [ clears throat ] Excuse me, ladies, but if you're gonna try it, you gotta buy it. Thank you so much. [ mumbles ] [ chatting, indistinct ] Wait a minute. Put that down. Look over here. That's a good color for you. Did you tell Alex? What's he gonna do? He's on his way out of town. Honey, this guy's out of town even when he's in town. Cori. Face it, Anna. You're gonna have to get rid of this guy. Alex? Him, too. This isn't one of your little intrigues. This is dangerous stuff. You're gonna have to stop these phone calls. Well, I'll just put an ad in the "Voice." "To the man at the Polish Bar: Don't call me, I'll call you." That's cute. You gonna try this on? Yeah. I'm gonna go look at some shoes. Cori: Anna? Yo, asshole. What are you doing? Get out of here! You want a show? Go to Times Square and put a quarter in the slots! Son of a bitch. Can you believe this guy? You can't even change clothes anymore. [ exhales ] What? [ both laugh ] Well, how do you like my shirt? Really nice. I think he liked it, too. Man: Am I disturbing you? Anna: Oh, no. It's 11:30, and you're calling to tell me to split. So you can pick me up in a black limousine, and we can drive around Manhattan having a conversation about how you want to fuck me in the back of your black limousine. But no, you're not disturbing me. Man: [ laughs ] Are you alone? Are you? Where are you? At the door, waiting for your chauffer. [ laughs ] Good, 'cause he's on his way. What are you eating? An orange. You want some? Of your orange or you? Why not both? [ chuckles ] My hands are tied up. They are? Must make phone calls kind of difficult. My hands are tied, and you make me pull the orange apart with my teeth. The sections are on the floor. You lie down and spread your thighs apart over the pieces. You're sitting in the juice. You're very wet. You make me lick it up, and you tell me to put the sections on my tongue and push them inside you. [ subway car rattles ] My hands are tied behind my back, and you pull my head into your thighs and make me suck up the orange and slide it inside you. Say it. Push the pieces into my cunt with your tongue. Do you want me to touch you now? Yes. Do you think about me when we're not on the phone? Yes. Do you think about me at work? Yes. Where do you work? What? What do you do? I want to know something abut you. I'm... [ chuckles ] I'm...I'm... an ichthyologist. A what? What'd you say? Does it matter? That depends. What do you do? I ask people questions. Like now? And record their answers. Anna. Hmm? Do you still have that orange? Maybe. I want you to squeeze it on your thighs. I have my pants on. No, you don't. Anna: How do you know that? Man: I know you. Squeeze some juice on your nipples. If only my mouth were there. Now your thighs. Mmm. Rub it over your lips. Do it. Ann: [ moans ] Man: [ moans ] Man: Now put it in your mouth. Put it on your tongue and...and taste it. Anna: Mmm. Man: I want you to touch yourself. Are you wet? Anna: Yes. Man: Oh, yes. You can feel me. I'm licking you. I'm fucking you, Anna. You're on the edge. You're going over. And you're coming. [ moans ] [ moans ] [ whispering ] Are you hard? [ heavy breathing ] - Tell me. - Yes. [ heavy breathing ] Do you have an orange? Why? Get one. Man: [ breathing heavily ] I have it. Anna: Bite into it. Get the juice all over your face. Now make a hole in it. A big one. Suck it into your mouth. Roll your tongue over it. Now I want you to take it and push the head of your co-- How long have you been sitting there? Who is he? What's his name? I-I don't know. I don't. He doesn't even know mine-- - What, he does? - No. - Does he? -No, he doesn't. Alex. It's really no big deal. It isn't. Let's not fight, okay? It's your last night. How long did you know I was there? I didn't. There really wasn't anybody on the line, was there? Because I'm going away, isn't it? You're trying to make me stay. [ beep ] Hi. It's Anna. I wanna do something. If you get this message before 2:00, meet me at... at the Acme on Great Jones. Bye-bye. Hi. Glad you got my message. Me, too. So, were you followed? [ laughs ] No. I think that's over with. No more creeps, huh? Or was it sleazes? Creeps. Still hearing from your caller? Alex and I just had a huge fight about that last night. But I think now he believes me. Well, that's good. You doing anything right now? I just said goodbye to Alex. I don't really feel like going home. Too depressing. Listen, I've got to take some samples from the Hudson up at the 79th Street boat docks... Ah. Château Hudson, 1987. I think you'll admire the bouquet. Eww. I'm gonna go back up. [ tires screech ] You asshole! [ tires screech ] [ tires screech ] Anna, what the fuck is going on? [ tires screech ] Listen up, bitch! We know you got the money! You better get it and get it fast, or I'm gonna fucking cut you to shreds! Oh, my God! They think I stole the money! What money? Jellybean: Anna? You're fucking dead, you know that? You're dead! What? All right, all right. Anna? Somebody stole a bunch of money. If you got it, or you know who took it, all I want you to do is tell me. I'm not trying to harm you. I just want to talk to you. You fucking bitch! I'm gonna get you! Come on! You sure the transvestite took the money? It had to be her. God! How could I be so stupid? No wonder these guys are following me. Shit! They'll never believe you didn't take it. Anna, I think you're in trouble. What else is new? - No, this is serious. - I know it's serious. I think you should call the police. And say what? Explain the situation. Anna, what are you gonna do? I don't know! I'm scared. Maybe they know where I live. Yeah. Do you want to come stay at my place? I just think you'll be safer there. Okay.
