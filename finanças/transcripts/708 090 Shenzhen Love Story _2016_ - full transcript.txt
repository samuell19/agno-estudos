An enterprise has its dream, and so does a person. So... what is your dream? To be an entrepreneur! Yes. She's right! Please remember me. I'm David Gao from David's Mobile Phones. As long as you have a great project, I will fund you and help you fulfill your dream of becoming an entrepreneur. Thank you. Let's welcome Mr. Jiang Hai, Chairman of Shanghao Home Furnishings. Hello, everyone. Li Mei Qing, you're late again. Aiyoo! Sir, I have a stomach ache. But I can hang in there. Another excuse. Hand in your work and go back to your seat. Thank you, sir. You're late again. Hey handsome, do you need a ride? No, thanks. Let's go. Li Mei Qing. What does your design have to do with the theme "Good Times"? Please explain. My design is related to the theme "Good Times..." Because it's lingerie, right? It has an intimate and subtle relationship with women. So, people describe teenage girls using the most beautiful words. That is to say, they want women to recall their "Good Times" through lingerie. My design uses this thought. This is designed for women. About style. The style is fashionable, fresh, lively and sexy. And I also use flower language. Take this for example. This one uses the flower language violet. Do you know the flower language of violet? Eternal beauty. In Greek mythology, Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, says goodbye to her lover before his long journey. Her tears drop on the ground. And on that spot, a beautiful flower sprouts. It is a violet. So, the overall theme of my lingerie is "Good Times Blossom!" Fine. Go back to your seat. Thank you, sir. Stay low-key. It's obviously you had the wrong design. Why are you so proud? Why don't you show us the finished product? That's so easy. I can hold an underwear show. An underwear show... Am I out of my mind? Please remember me. I'm David Gao from David's Mobile Phones. As long as you have great project, I will fund you and help you fulfill your dream of becoming an entrepreneur. Lingerie? Yes. I can do this. Really? Great! But... you have to show your strengths with it. I have great strengths. I majored in design. - You did? - Yes. But I have to verify your strengths... Verify? Here, look! Look. This is my business plan. And these are my lingerie designs. Everyone has a different flower language. Look here, this is my... Mr. Gao, how do you want me to verify my strengths? I think you know. Scumbags like you... you don't have the right! You bitch! What? You want to beat me? Help! He wants to beat me. Beat me. Just beat me! - Bitch. - Just beat me! Shenzhen! I'm coming! Don't push. Don't push. Don't push. Don't push! I know, I know. I know. Don't push. Don't push. Okay. Sir, this is mine. - Okay, next. - Sir! Please read my resume first. You can wait for my call. I know. - Listen to me. - Next. I was an outstanding university student when I graduated. And I was rewarded as an advanced employee in two years. I am totally qualified for this job. Everyone who comes to Shenzhen is capable. Next, next! Don't push. No, no, no. Mine is torn. What should I do? Okay, next! Hello? Where are you now? I'm going to Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. I'm telling you, the tourist magazine called and asked when they would have your article. Soon. When I get the pictures I want. What is your theme of this tour? The Meaning of Travel. So what is the meaning of travel? Don't ask so many questions. The meaning of travel... When I was traveling, I wanted to find bravery. But as I grew up I found that I'm small when I travel. Come home when it's over. It's been years. We'll see. I'm still on my trip. Talk to you later. Bye. Sir, the Buddhas you draw are so beautiful. Hi. They're not Buddhas. It's a family. They are obviously Buddhas. Why do you call them a family? The mind of Buddha is big love, and love is family. Family is a place of love, forgiveness and tolerance. And the bottom line is, things are changing. Please cherish people in the present. You still don't understand. Come home with me. Oh, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This is my son. Nice boy. That's enough. Thank you. Look at me. You unfilial kid! You gave up your major of international trade and got involved with this crap. I won't allow it! Old Li. Calm down. Talk to him nicely. It's all because of you! You spoiled him! What have I done wrong? What's wrong with me loving race cars and photography? You're such a loafer and a black sheep. While I'm here, I won't allow you to touch these things! Why do you call me a loafer? Just because I'm doing things you don't like? You're a gangster. And this is gangster logic. - What did you say? - I said you are a gangster! No! Old Li. Ming Ming. Old Li, you... Yeah, I'm a gangster. So what? It's your tyranny that killed my mom! Ming, don't speak nonsense like that! - I said nothing wrong! - What did you say? I said my mom died because of you! You... Aunt Xue, are you okay? Aunt Xue, you're bleeding. You two just stop fighting. I'm independent now. Just leave me alone! Fine, I'll leave you alone. Get out of my house! Fine. - Ming Ming. - Don't stop him! Or you can leave with him. Old Li! [Bully] Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off... David Gao. - Jiang... - Jiang Hai. Mr. Jiang. Is this yours? Yes, look. These are my designs. Our teacher said if I could compete in a contest, - I would be as good as those masters— - Stop. And... I'll say it again. I'm here not to talk about your lingerie today. But for this... Look. The sales model of WeChat Moments. It's very simple. For example, I want to build up my lingerie shop. If I open a physical store, I need at least a few hundred thousand yuan. I'm still a student, and don't have that much money. I find that many people browse their WeChat Moments the first thing in the morning. When they post their selfies and tour pictures, I'll post my own design. They will contact me if they like it. It's a zero cost business. Do you have any notable achievements? I wouldn't have met that jerk if I did. So why do you think people will buy your stuff? Because they like my designs. And... and they trust me. Yeah. That's the most important thing. You know? Integrity is something more important than life. Once you lose it, nobody will trust you anymore. And you can say goodbye to the business. It's that serious? Yeah. Hello, girls! I have big news to share with you. What news? I'm going to build a platform and help you fulfill your dream of a runway show. A runway show? You have a model right there. Liu Sha Sha. Me? Why don't you do it yourself? Wen Wen, you have a good figure. Okay? I still have a lot of books to read, so I'm a little busy. Don't be so boring. Lu Lu, my women's lingerie is perfect for you. Because you're the cutest. Boring. Civil servant enrollment. - Same crap again. - Don't. What are you doing? You can give it to me. - I want it too. Let me borrow it please. - No. Wait a minute! It's mine. I won't give my book to you since you aren't helping with my runway show. Have some self-esteem. You stay in the room all day long preparing for the graduate school exam. Aren't you bored? What's wrong with graduate school? It's great to stay at school, isn't it? And you? What's so good about being a civil servant? You are just being condescending. If my family was as rich as yours, I'd do whatever I want to do. And you... Your life is all about lingerie. What's wrong with that? You don't wear lingerie every day? You are not wearing it right now? Li Mei Qing. I'm telling you! If you can pull off the runway show, I'll be your model for free. - It's a deal. - Deal. - That's your word! - It is! Did you hear that? Yes, we did. Thank you. Be quiet. Family is a place of love, forgiveness and tolerance. And the bottom line is, things are changing. Please cherish the people in the present. [Aunt Xue: Something happened to your dad. Come home soon!] Don't worry. Uncle Li will be all right. Aunt Xue is taking care of him in hospital. As scheduled, the new smart phone of your family's company launched yesterday at 10:00 a.m. But David Gao held a press conference at 9:30 a.m. and launched his new product. The phone of your two companies are exactly the same. David Gao announced this morning that he would sue your company for infringing upon intellectual property. Your dad is out of danger now. Talk to him nicely. While Chairman Li is in the hospital, Li Ming Zhe will act on his behalf. The most important thing is to recoup our losses and investigate the reason for the new product leaking. I want to listen to your thoughts first. Three members in the design department, including myself, have participated in the design of the new product. We divide our work. Which means each one of us only has the knowledge of our own part. And Director Song did all the summarizing work. The production drawings for the production department were delivered by stage. The last stage of drawings was delivered by Director Song and done under her supervision. They were retrieved by her in the end. So it's impossible for our department to leak the product. Including myself, everyone involved in the production work of the new product is suspicious. You can investigate me all you want. I'll be proven innocent. Thank you! Thank you! Excuse me. Can I borrow you for a minute to fill out a form for me? Look. I'm not a credit card agent or a counterfeit product vendor. I'm a college student. And I'm doing market research. Can I borrow you for a minute? Only a minute. I have an appointment. And I'm late. No, listen. I design lingerie. This is my first time starting my own business. And I want to do research. It's important for me. Can you help me? Please? - Okay. - Thank you. Here's the pen. And this is my own design. Do you like it? You designed this? Do you find it too garish? No, I like it very much. I wonder if you have a finished product. Yes, I do! But I don't have them now. You can leave your number on the research form. And when I have the finished product, I'll send it to you. Free shipping. Thank you. You are so friendly. Call me when it's done. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Madam, I'm Li Mei Qing. Make sure you remember me when I call. Bye-bye. - Hello. - Mr. Jiang, I have good news for you. With my unremitting efforts, I finally found someone who wants to buy my lingerie. Better yet, it's an advance sale. She's a beautiful girl. Really? Congratulations then. I'm so impressed with myself. I feel so happy! By the way, complete your WeChat Mall plan soon. And send it to me when it's done. You bet. I'm so excited today. I'll work to finish it overnight. Okay. Bye. Why do you look at me like that? No, I just want to know, why do you look so happy? It's been a while since you looked like this. I think you're getting this wrong. ♫ Look at how many beautiful mountains and clear waters the world has ever seen ♫ ♫ The youth is full of memories ♫ ♫ Think about how many stories have been lost behind ♫ ♫ After this peaceful touch I started to regret ♫ ♫ We walk in time, bow our heads before desire ♫ ♫ Have you forgotten the ordinary life? ♫ ♫ We are walking out of time ♫ ♫ The last discovery was just a dream ♫ I really like her. Yes. - Hey. - What? Turn back. What are you doing? She sees you, Dork. Dummy. Let's go. So tired. Good for you. The girl we all liked becomes your girlfriend. Drink this one. It's because I'm talented. Fine, save it. We will drink instead. To his talent. Thank you. - Talented. - Yes, you are. Good evening. You tell her. No, you tell her. Why are you hemming and hawing? Qing Qing, can you stop posting about your lingerie? Why? You should know that. You're posting too much. Many classmates have blocked you. Thank you for telling me. If I remember correctly, you're ready to deliver your marketing plan to me today. I don't know if something happened to you. But as someone who wants to fulfill her entrepreneurial dream, you've disappointed me. Fine, it seems that you don't want to talk about your marketing plan. So there's no point for me to stay. Yeah, you hate what I said. But crying is no solution. You don't understand. I'll lose my dignity when my roommates find out. What's the use of dignity? Have you ever thought why they don't respect you? Isn't it because you aren't doing your best or because you offend somebody? The first thing you should do now is to recover your trust among people. The first thing I should do now is to delete them all. Since they don't want to see my designs, I won't let them. Willfulness is no solution. Get in the car. I'll take you to some place. You know? This was the first place I worked in when I came to Shenzhen. Are you showing off your wealth? You think I sat in an air-conditioned office and played with my computer? Didn't you? Listen. Do you see these buildings? They were built by my fellow workers and I. Every building is built from its foundation up. Starting your own business is no exception. If you aren't sure about it, you'd better go back home and prepare for civil service exams. Don't bring that up... I'm not going back. I will have a place here. Wow, it's so beautiful. Ah, it's so cold! Come with me. I should have brought my swimsuit! I'm so happy! I will fight for it! I'll do my best. I know you'll be successful. Yeah, I'll do my best. Jia You! Jia You! Come on, let's yell it together. One, two, three. - Jia You! - Jia You! ♫ You better not love me ♫ ♫ Stop tempting me ♫ ♫ Time has passed ♫ You like this song? Yeah, it's good. ♫ You better not love me ♫ You just lack taste. This is my cup of tea. You know? I think you should listen to this type of music more often. Because you are under great pressure. When you listen to these songs, they'll relax and entertain you. - Am I right? - Stop it! I'm driving. Then you should answer me. My college is there. Okay. We are here, Miss Li. Thank you! I feel so much better now. Watch out. - Are you okay now? - Yeah. That's good. My time paid off. Thank you. Where do you live? One, two, three, four. The fourth floor. I see. Go back now. You have classes tomorrow. Okay, bye-bye. Wait a minute. Don't forget your assignment. Don't worry. With your encouragement, I'll do my best! Good. What's wrong? I don't know how to say this. What is it? I'm so grateful for your encouragement when I'm down. What's that? Good night. You're back. Did you drink again? Why? You should know it's a social occasion! Leave me alone. I want to sleep. Honey, I'm leaving with our girl. I'm going back to my family after all these years. While helping you and bringing up our child, I've been living a wealthy and easy life. But I'm confused and uncertain when I see happiness in others' eyes. As if I am detached from the outside world. And it seems that you are leaving me, too. When I'm down, you need to give me encouragement I hope we'll remember each other after we're separated, and cherish what we have now. What are you so serious about? The latest game. What's so great about it? It's great. Not only can you buy treasures, but also earn some money. You can buy treasures in it. Can you buy mobile phones with it? Of course! You did me a big favor, brat! Since you're so clever, I lost my phone... Can you pull the surveillance video for me? Okay. Come in, please. Have a seat. Mr. Li, I'm sorry. I... I know it's a bad time for me to resign from my job. But I'm having a number of issues. I definitely didn't betray our company. It's just that the company isn't doing well. My wife and I just had a baby, so we need the money. And I've received a great job offer. So I... Fine. Thank you, Mr. Li. I'll excuse myself. Mr. Li. Many companies have started poaching. Take care. You are saying, the missing footage is from Song Meiyue's office? Yeah. All the evidence points to Song Mei Yue. But I think Su Zhi Ming is also a suspect. He was also in the frame. And he suddenly submitted the resignation. I think it has something to do with him. You should put it aside. What we want is the evidence. Before we get it, we can't be judgmental towards anyone. For now, you need to familiarize yourself with our business and negotiate with David Gao to minimize our losses. I know. Su Zhi Ming, Wang Jian Guo and Song Mei Yue are all seasoned employees. Especially Song Mei Yue. She's very capable, and trusted by your father. As a reward, your father gave her shares in the corporation. Really? There're other rumors in the company. But don't worry. If you didn't leave home, it probably wouldn't have happened. Aunt Xue, are you okay? I'm fine. Come on, have a seat. Aunt Xue, sit. Are you okay? I'm fine. Sorry. It's all my fault. You wouldn't be like this if you hadn't taken the blow for me. Don't say sorry to me. Ever since my mom passed away, it's you who has been taking care of my dad and me, but I implicated you. You little fool. You're also my child. Aunt Xue. - I meant to ask you... - What? Why don't you and dad have another child? You're still young. Your dad doesn't want it. Why? Because he doesn't want another child to share his love with you. Come in. Wow, you have such a big office all to yourself? It's so cool! God, when will I have a big office like yours? You will someday. Come and take a look. The roadshow platform of this project was built by a few entrepreneurs and myself. We're talking it over with an infomercial program of Shenzhen Media Group. The purpose is to fund entrepreneurial projects of young people. You can put your plan on this platform. If someone likes your project, soon after, you'll have your office. You like me, don't you? Little girl, you're oversensitive. Helping others is the origin of happiness, so— Stop. I know you want to say you appreciate my designs and entrepreneurship. But your face shows the passion you have for me... And my sixth sense tells me that you like me very much. I'm twenty years old, and don't have a boyfriend. - So— - Stop! Listen. From now on, you have to plan for your entrepreneurial career In this career, there are no men. You have to be an independent woman, standing on your own two feet. Did you hear me? What did you say? I can't hear you! Just take a selfie with me. All right. Take a look at this. Mr. Gao, I think we all know a great deal about this. We don't want to stir up the dispute. We hope you can drop the case. So let's settle it ourselves, okay? Settle it ourselves? Ms. Song. If we can talk about the settlement in private, I will certainly consider it. Mr. Gao, we're here to sincerely address the matter. The new product should have brought you substantial income. If you're willing to drop the case, we'll make amends to you. Young man, how will do that? We'll pay you ¥2 million. ¥2 million? Forget it! How about I give you ¥2 million to buy your company? Are you kidding me? Do you know the value of our company? Young man, times have changed. Your company is worthless now. I would never sell our company. Young man. You're not in charge. Tell Li Guo Hua, the old man, he's been acting as a tyrant for years and now it's payback time. Such a fox. He pretends to be sick every time there's a crisis. He sends a reckless boy to meet me, and hides in his own shell. - Let's go! - Stop! - Get him! Hurry! Deal with it... You've been back for awhile, why are you still so irritable? Did you fight with someone again? I've been putting up with him, okay? But we're helpless. The two of us were ripped off by him right there. Cool down. Let me tell you something. I was selling your phones in the game. Guess what? I have sold a dozen of them! Here are the addresses and numbers. Send someone to deliver them tomorrow. I have an idea. Since you can sell phones in an online game... I know you have doubts about me. It's normal. But I will prove my innocence. Okay, listen. Since we still have so many unsold phones, I can change their appearance and sell them in your online shop. Okay. And promote the phone in the game. It's workable. And it's Singles' Day soon. An online shopping frenzy is coming. Right? You're right. Yeah. It's settled then. You two decide on the appearance of the phone, and the three of us will work on the online promotion. Yeah, okay. What, you like traveling, too? What I loved most in college was traveling. Every time you get to a new country or place, you can reflect differently on life. You know, many people choose to go to Lijiang, but few of them will go to Shangrila. Shangrila? And few people will go to Iraq. You've been to Iraq? Yes. You haven't been to South Africa, have you? South Africa? I think... I went there in my senior year. I don't think you've been to Peru, have you? Peru? I have been to Machu Picchu. What chu? Machu Picchu. Machu Picchu. It must be beautiful there. - This one! See! - Yes. Is it good enough? We'll use this one. - And you take care of the game. - Okay! And promote our phone in it. You help him with the game. Okay, okay! And you're in charge of all customer service, Jie. This one. And we should add the volume here. Yeah, yes! Look. Our total sales today are 1.3 million! Yeah! Yeah! Great! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Our Singles' Day promotion was successful. It means that we'll have a great market space in e-commerce. I've talked with Chairman Li. We'll focus on the expansion of e-commerce. The reason why we're here is because I want to know your opinion and ideas of e-commerce. You can bring it up. I'm against it. Our lawsuit is unsettled now. If their company wins the case, we'll have to pay huge damages. I think we should raise the money to deal with their appeal. Under the circumstances, we can't blindly expand. We are still investigating the new product leak. How can you be sure we'll lose and have to pay damages? David Gao is willing to buy my corporation shares for ¥30 million. After all, the company was built with our painstaking effort. I don't want it to end up in David Gao's hands. So if any one of you can pay the same price, I'll sell them to him or her first. Dad, have some tea. When the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. They're my brothers who've worked with me for a dozen years. The major problem now is to fill the financing gap. The judge has ruled. If you can't settle with David Gao in a month, he'll officially take us to court. That way, we'll have to pay huge damages and possibly go bankrupt. Since the shareholders offered to sell their shares, I'm afraid David Gao will buy us out at a low price. It's okay. I'll send you to see someone tomorrow. I'm surprised by the situation your company finds itself in. Chairman Li and I are old friends. Also, our bank and your company have been on good terms for a long time. But... It's just... given the situation of your company now, we can't grant you a loan. Uncle Chen, we haven't lost the case. - And I have a proposal— - I know, I know. But you have to understand. Our bank isn't able to proceed. My proposal will definitely work... I'm sorry. Okay. Thank you, Uncle Chen. Little Li! Yes? You can try this man. He may be able to help you. Thank you, Uncle Chen. [Jiang Hai, Shanghao Home Furnishings] Jiang Hai? Yes. He'll agree to review a proposal to help our company. But we have to show him there's hope. Bring him to Cambodia then. Why Cambodia? The idiots think I'm done. Bring Jiang Hai to Cambodia. He can see hope there. [Phnom Penh International Airport] [Silver Pagoda] [Phnom Penh] It's here? It's impressive. Yeah, it's okay. Experience counts. Chairman Li has forethought. I really admire that. I also didn't expect this from my dad. This way, please. Uncle Li is awesome. Aiya! [Dehong] Someone's taking the car! They're taking our car! It's too late! - Do you have another car? - Yes, follow me. Hurry! Come on! Let me! Where are they? David Gao? I knew it was you! Ms. Song. I've imagined this moment for so long. But I never thought we would meet here. What a delicate face. I just don't understand. How can you be with the old man Li Guo Hua? It's such a shame. David Gao, what do you want? Don't touch me! Don't! I can give you things that Li Guo Hua can give you, and those he can't. As long as you get me the thing I want, I won't treat you badly. Witch! If it wasn't for your beauty, I wouldn't have talked to you! You want it the hard way? Fine. Men! I'll ask you again. Will you give it to me or not? I will, I will! Take away the bucket now. You should have agreed to it sooner to spare all this suffering. Let her down. Tell me, where is it? What? Are you playing with me? You want it to be harder? Do you? Do you see those snakes? I'll leave you to them. So think about where the thing is, okay? Are you telling me or not? I'll tell you! I'll tell you! It is... it is... Are you okay? Come on, let's go! You can't go there. [Hospital] Sir, have some rest. - Mr. Li. - Yes? Do you know why David Gao kidnapped Ms. Song? I used to meet with David Gao. I think you have already known that. Yeah. David Gao gave me a tempting offer. But I refused him. And I told him I had evidence of him setting up our company. You have evidence? Why didn't you tell me earlier? If you exposed his crime earlier, we would be fine now. Calm down. We should all calm down. Listen to Ms. Song first. Sit down. In fact, I lied to him. I don't have the evidence. I was just... What? I was just suspicious. So the missing surveillance footage is in your hand. Yes. [Manager Song Office] [USD memory successful unplug] Have you brought what I want? This is the design data of the new product. I hope that we can cooperate happily. You're right. I stole the design data of the new product, and gave it to David Gao. I've treated you well all these years. I didn't expect it you would sell me out. Aunt Xue, why did you do this? Why? It's all because of her. Since Ming Zhe's mother passed away, no matter if it was the company or Guo Hua, they always cared about me. I was always the most important. But everything changed when you came here. Since you came here, you gained Guo Hua's trust. And he gave all his shares to you. You think because you're young and beautiful you can replace me at any time? I've never thought of replacing you. What I have now all comes from hard work! Even if you don't do it now, what about in the future? If the new product launched, you'd become more important in the company! You stole the product design and framed her because of this? Yes. As long as she was considered the traitor, you would get rid of her. You're just ignorant! Aunt Xue, have you thought that what you did will destroy our family? I really didn't think of that. I didn't expect that David Gao... would stab us in the back after he got what he wanted, and that he'd sue us for money. I begged him, but... Guo Hua, I never thought things would end up like this. Fortunately, things are looking up now. Please, forgive me! Dad. I'll turn myself in and confess everything. For the sake of our marriage, please forgive me! I know what I did was wrong. ♫ Ah. You ♫ ♫ You are beautiful ♫ ♫ I just want to be with you ♫ You're a very special girl. You were wronged by everyone, but you didn't tell us the truth even when you knew it. I didn't have the actual evidence. Nobody would believe me even if I told the truth. Take you for example. If I told you it was the Chairman's wife who did it, who would you choose to believe, me? I must accept that I would have believed Aunt Xue back then. But now... I'll believe you. But do you believe me? Now I want you to believe in me for this... I like you. I... believe you. Hello! - Are you done? - Yeah. Here's a little gift. Wow, so romantic! How much did you donate? 400 ml. - 400 ml? - Yeah. Do you feel all right now? Since you asked, I do feel a little dizzy now. Really? Come on, have a seat. Life is tough. I have to donate blood to take you to dinner. Why are you doing this? You're so adorable. No, you helped me when I needed you the most. So when I saw the RV for blood donation, I want to help others by donating blood. I didn't expect you'd be so open-minded. You just discovered that? By the way, how is your graduation show? I have pulled a few all-nighters, but it's almost done. - Good. - Will you come? I'll be there for you. Really? Great. I'll make an invitation for you myself. - Okay, let's go. - Let's go. Come on. - I propose a toast. - Thanks. Thanks to your help, our company survived the crisis. I feel ashamed. When you're part of the system, you can't do whatever you want. You're very welcome. The rose is in her hand, the flavor in mine. If we switched places, you would help me. Moreover, your company scale can't be compared. I'm just a little more experienced. But I don't think our company is a special case. It's tough for private enterprises now. Indeed, it's a bottleneck for you. Our small and medium-sized enterprises have been fighting alone and lack self-protection awareness. We're threatened by growing crisis. Especially when our funds cut-off, that's the biggest issue. When I was traveling in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, I learned about a local organization called Huachong. Huachong of the Naxi nationality is like a private but mutually beneficial society. The members are friends, brothers and relatives. And they have to pay some Chongman, which is an activity fund. They help anyone who can benefit from the fund. It's just means that there is strength in numbers. It shows the importance of a team. When you want to buy a treasure, it's better to dig a well than buy a large water bucket. It shows the importance of channels. So when I saw the RV for blood donation, I want to help others by donating blood. I have an idea. Why don't we create our own association of private enterprises? An association? The Huachong of Shenzhen. It's workable.
