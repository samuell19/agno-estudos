The teacher looks like a pervert. He was drooling at you. Thanks. Did you see his mug? A real turn-off. If I lie on the rails and the train passes over my head, I can choose any one of you three. A thing under the train picks up the electricity. If it touches you you'll die. It depends. You have to choose the right one. - I bet you I'll do it. - What do you bet? If I win, I choose one of you to come with me in the wagon. What happens in the wagon? What I want. What does that mean? It means I do what I want with you. All right then. What about you? Yes. I agree. All right. OK, let's go! Ahmed! Come back. Don't do it! You're really sick! I said I'd do it. You just have to choose the right train. And if you make a mistake? What can I say. Bye-bye everybody! Who shall I choose? Don't worry, it'll be all right. - How much? - The same as last time. You didn't come home last night. I went to the pictures with Severine. Then we hung around. - What did you see? - I don't know. You don't even know! I do, the story of a girl who leaves home, travels across France on foot, becomes mad, she hears voices. But at least she's free. What's the matter? Why are you looking at me? For nothing. That's true, there's absolutely nothing between us. You tire me. Yes, but you're never tired for your clients! Who pays the bills in the meantime? Want me to beg? You'd better stop stealing from my purse. Is that a threat? Mom, I'm leaving. I'd have liked you to talk to me. Not just about money. I want to live another life. I'm leaving. I won't bother you anymore. I want to travel, to see places. Chloe. We're closed. I know. I just came to give you this back. I never thought I'd see that again. Where did you find it? Not far from here. On a bench. How did you know I was here? Because of the box of matches. I haven't touched anything. And honest too! That's a change. I'd have nicked the money. What's your name? Chloe. Do you want a cocoa? Come on. Sit there. There you are. You dance very well. Are you a professional? No, I do it for pleasure. I'd have liked to go on the stage. but I never got the chance. So you've wasted your Sunday just to bring me this? I had nothing else to do. No boyfriend? Don't worry, I'm not a cop! I've run away from home. I'm sleeping rough. I can't keep you here. Don't worry, there's no hurry. Finish. Take this. No, I didn't come for that. I'd like to work. I could help you. Wait, do the cleaning, I don't know. There's no work for you here. And you're far too young. How old are you? Not even 18? It's better than nothing. - Go on. - Thank you. What now? I can't do anything for you. Thanks for the bag. Thanks for the cocoa. You're welcome. Still here? If I'm passing by, can I come and see you? Look, I don't have the time... for anyone. Wake up! I don't want you here. Get up, get out! How did you... What's this? What have you done? You've broken the window. Why? Who's going to pay? I'm sorry. I'll pay you. That's right! Get lost! Can't I stay a while? I won't bother you. You are bothering me! I like being alone. Out you go. You should have kept the bag. I owe you nothing. Go on, get lost! And don't you come back! Do you understand? I'd like a ticket for Paris, please. Can't you read? Closed. There aren't any more trains until tomorrow morning. No, it isn't him. It isn't my musician. He won't be coming now. Because there aren't any more trains. Did you know that? I don't care. I don't care either. No trains leaving, no trains arriving... until tomorrow. What are you doing here? Waiting for someone? Lost your eyes? Tell me, were you waiting for me? Pity. You're right, it's nice here, four star service, central heating, good company... Nice and quiet. I'll leave you. Good night. We're closing gentlemen, Come on. Move on now. Sir! Please, miss. You can't stay here. Well? They threw you out? I told you, there are no more trains. I'm not blind. My name's Jean-Michel. What's yours? I don't know. What do you mean? I don't know. Are you deaf? Right. Miss I-Don't-Know. You might not be blind but you seem lost. Yes, I've run away from home. You're right. One should move, take risks. Go at it alone. I produce records. Here? Why aren't you in Paris? I go there sometimes. Brussels and Rotterdam too. I don't know Rotterdam. They record in English there. It opens other markets for me. Whilst in Paris... In Paris there's too much competition for me. So I do my own thing in small towns. Yes... you see, music's my passion. What I like about people is their passions. That's what makes them special. Do you have a passion? Dancing. You dance? I love that. I'd love to see you dance. But I've stopped. Come now! One doesn't forget. It's like riding a bicycle. Really, I'd like to see you dance. Just for me. I don't like to be watched. I'll shut my eyes. There are much prettier girls than me who dance. I suppose you're right. But maybe it's you I want to see dancing. Yes, are you stupid or what? All right, I'll do it. You will? Really? You know, you'd be the first girl to dance for me. You've nowhere to sleep. Well, look... You can come to my place but don't get any ideas. I'm just helping out. Ok, great! This way, come on. Is that yours? Yes. What's the matter? Don't you like it? It's worth a lot of money. Money, money, always money! Yes, money. That's all there is in life. I tell you, my favorite colour is the colour of money. Your place is nice. Listen to this. It's a track I'm mixing. Do you like it? It's awful! You're hard to please! It pays, so I don't care. You asked me if I liked it... That's true. I like you. Pity you're too young. What does that mean? You're too young for me. Anyway, music seems to pay. That and other things. I make extra money at poker. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. Well yes, I'm hooked on poker. There's the bed and there's the sofa. Make yourself at home. You can put this on. It's silk. - Like it? - I've seen it before. Really? It's yours then. A present. I'll leave you. I have things to do. My name's Chloe. Chloe? It suits you. "For the little runaway. See you later. Jean-Michel." Hello. Mommy? Yes. It's me. I'm fine. No, I won't come back. Don't insist. I'm fine here. I won't tell you where I am. Don't worry. I'm fine. Get off my back! I call you and you get on my back! There's no point in me coming back. No, I don't have a phone. I'll call you. Yes. Goodbye. There you are. I've come to pay for the window. And to thank you. You've been very kind. I turned you out. You call that kind? It doesn't matter. I know you're kind. It shows. It shows in your eyes. You can call me Katia, if you like. I can pay for the window. It's true. Did you steal it? This guy I met yesterday gave it to me. He's rich. What did he want in exchange of this money? Nothing, nothing at all. Beware of guys like that. But he's not interested in me. I'm too young for him anyway. You haven't fallen for him already? I think so. I think I really like him. How much for the window? Nothing, I tell you. I don't want your money. Listen, you have to teach me to dance. I've gone and said I could dance. I can't dance to save my life. You sleep on the floor? I sleep where I like. Shit, what time is it? Midnight! I'm late. You're going? Where? Out. Do you want to come? Well? I'm broke. You've taken everything, damn you! I'll play the girl. What? No way, she's off limits. A strip poker, in three goes, then. If you win, you get your money back. If you lose, she strips for us. You wanted to dance for me... This is your chance. You're mad. I wanted to dance for you in private. There are too many people. One moment, gentlemen. Don't worry. I won't lose. My luck will turn. Look... Say you will, so I can win my money back. Alright? Banco! Come on girls! Champagne! Your pullover. Take off your pullover. Another hand. Come on, drink. - Have a drink. - You're mad. I'll get drunk. So what? We're here to have fun, aren't we? Go on, have a drink. Are we playing or what? I'm coming. There's no hurry. Relax. You look silly like that. Let's dance. They won't hurt you. I've lost again. Take off your skirt. He's lost again. She's not bad. You could make some money We organise amateur strip shows. Then one of us does a pro number. You could make 1000 a night. Come on! Don't worry. It won't go any further. Give me a chance to win my money. What are you doing? It's the game. You've started, you have to go on now. How beautiful you are! I want you tonight. You're very beautiful Chloe! You shouldn't be ashamed. Coming! Drink up! Mixing makes you drunk. Go ahead, get drunk for once! We'll have fun like you've never had fun before. Drink up! Go on. Some more! There you go! You should stay with us, you'd make a fortune. You don't understand! Bastard! Come on! I don't want to go back there! Oh, it's you! How do you like my skirt? You're beautiful! He gave it to me. Do you like it? Very much. It changes you completely. It isn't the skirt. We made love. He loves me. And I love him too. I'd like you to fall in love. Love is over for me. I don't believe in it any more'. That's crazy. You're so negative. And we played strip poker. What? Strip poker. He lost at cards. So I undressed... and there were other people. Who was there? People. At a night club. They offered me work stripping. But I turn it down. And he agreed? I think he did. How can you know? He frequents strange people. Your story is strange. But it was just for fun! Don't get upset, Chloe. Don't be sad. I'm afraid he might stop loving me. That he might drop me. Feeling better? Not so sad? You aren't cross? Can I stay with you tonight? He isn't coming back. Yes, if you like. Why not? Your place is fun. All these things... Yes, everything I own is in this room... There's no man in your life? What man? I don't know, a man. You were talking about men the other day. No, I have no one in my life. It's fine that way. Is this alright to sleep in? Are you asleep? Look, Chloe... beware of guys who flatter you. They're often no good. I'd prefer you stopped seeing him. You aren't going to start again! You don't even know him. Let me meet him and I'll tell you what I think. You're a pain! You aren't going to keep tabs on us! You're a pain! You don't understand. I didn't leave my mother to find another one! Get off! Where are you going? You're going back? Yes, back to him! I won't tell you where it is. I don't trust you! You're jealous. You don't have a man. It's over for you! I'm sorry, I didn't want to hit you. I swear. Let go of me! You're right! Get lost! Why do you love me, Jean-Michel? I don't know. Because you're lost like me. And because... Because you're very beautiful. We must live differently. How? I don't know. I don't know... we should leave, go somewhere else. Where do you want us to go? I don't know. Where you like. Paris. No, in Paris it'll be the same, we'll be bothered all the time. No, we must go far away. It's stuffy in here. I wanted to see you. About the money I owe you... You're completely crazy! Stop it! You're killing him. You'll kill him! Stop pissing me off! So you've forgotten you owe me two grand? You've got two days. Otherwise we'll be back. Don't worry we'll take care of you. It didn't work with Aldo. They started again. I need dough. Otherwise, I'll be dead in a day. Let's go. We'll leave straight away. It's no use they'll always catch up with me. I'll do anything for you. I don't want them to kill you. There's only one thing you can do for me. What? Tell me, what? Do you remember the guy at the club? You remember? Well, yesterday I saw him again. He's lonely. He's looking for a girl he could give some money to, just for one night, that's all. And he fancies you. He told me. I can't do it. I'm not a whore, Jean-Michel. Who's talking about being a whore? All I'm asking is for you to see him so he gives us the dough. You won't love me any more. You'll be put off. Why do you say that? It isn't true. I'll love you alot more because you did it for me. No, it's not true. Don't say that! Didn't you say you'd do anything to get us out of this? Didn't you say that? Yes, but... I only have you Chloe. Only you, no one else. Alright. Alright, I'll do it. How much am I worth, do you think? Answer me. I look like transvestite. Mind you that's good, trannies excite men! You didn't answer last night, how much am I worth? Don't worry about that. I want to know! What price? I don't know. Three thousand. Three thousand? Three thousand's expensive. You think I'm worth that? You're worth a lot more than that. For me, you're worth all the gold in the world. Right. Left. Very nice, this young girl. A pearl! Very young, aren't you? - Be gentle. It's her first time. - Yes, of course. I'll leave you. See you later. You've cost me a lot, you know, little girl? Come closer. Come on, come closer. No, not the mouth. Jean-Michel told me no the mouth! The mouth is for when you love. You don't love me? Open your blouse. Show me. What's going on? I thought I could... I can't. You can't back out now, understand! Give back the money! I can't. I gave it to a guy who was downstairs. I can't Jean-Michel. I can't. But he's paid and you agreed! But it's revolting you can't force me to do it. You'll see if I can't force you! Stop it! I'll show you how to do it! - Take that off! - Stop it! Stop it Jean-Michel! You're mad, stop it! Don't do that! You're hurting me. You have no right! You'll do what I tell you! Understand? You'll do everything he wants. Everything! You'll do what he tells you! You'll do everything he asks! She's all yours. I'll leave her to you. I love little girls who cry. Come on, it's over. Don't touch me! This is for you. It's my share? There's no share. We own everything together. And my arse belongs to everyone! I don't want your stinking money! Listen, Chloe... It hurts me too. I don't give a damn! You're a wimp! - You can't fight, but you beat me up! - Don't say that! But you are a wimp! Go on, hit me if it helps. Go on! Look at me, Look at my face. It's finished. I'll never be the same. I've had it, Jean-Michel. My life is completely ruined. Only you can save me by loving me very much. I just want to stay here, in your arms. I'm broken, Jean-Michel, I don't want to anymore. It disgusts me. It'll come back. I promise you. Trust me. We'll get away from here. We'll go very far. Just you and me. We'll have a new life. We just need a bit more dough, that's all. What does that mean? You know very well, Chloe. Are you having me on? It wasn't meant to be like this! How much? How much? Undress over there. Undress over there. I want you naked. Naked costs more. - Are you new? - Yes. I'm Elsa, and you? Katia. Katia. Elsa, Katia... it rhymes. You got the time? Not a chatterbox huh. Is that all? That's all I've got. A hand job then. Put your things over there. Come in. Pleased to see me? I hope you've improved! Pay up or get lost, I'm busy! Money! Money! If you knew how little I care! I can get as much as I want! Do you want some dough? There, look. There's money. Put this on or get lost! Alright, I'll put it on. Wait, let me do it. I love to undress. You needn't have paid so much, you came like a rabbit. Eat your money! Eat it, little whore! Bitch! I need a wash. Can I take a shower? I'm dirty, dirty, dirty... I feel dirty, dirty, dirty... It'll never go away. I'll always feel dirty. No, it'll go away. You'll see. He won't love me anymore. I know... I'll love him. Don't worry, he wont' drop you so soon. Who do you see? I don't know. Not me, anyway. A whore. That's what you see. So stop making a fuss! Let's go and have lunch. Money's important. Make it or else you die. The others are no better than us. Look around. But I can't take it, the men and all that, it disgusts me. It's normal I hate them too. But what can you do? Luckily there's Jean-Michel. He'd freak out if I continued. Leave off! What's the matter? Are you avoiding me? Get lost, Katia! Look at you! What are you doing in this rotten neighbourhood? Do you know what that girl does? You're getting trapped too. I do what I like! Listen, you're going to ruin your life. Stop talking rubbish! Let's have a talk. Then you can do what you like, OK? Why do you keep bugging me? I know what I'm doing. I'm in love! I'd do anything for him. What do you want to teach me? Look at you! You've wasted your life! Yes, that's true. That's why I'm here, you see? So you don't waste yours. I've already told you. You're not my mother, leave off! Come in. Come in. You again? Come in! I have to talk to someone. I'll be right back. I'm sorry for yesterday, Katia. I didn't mean what I said. I was upset. I don't hold grudges. In fact, it's true, I have no right to meddle. I'm not your mother, I know. That's why I came back. I'd like to show you something. It's very important. Now? Yes. I can't drop everything like that. Yes you can. If you don't want to go home, you can live with me. You could help me. And I'd pay you, alright? Come on. I have to go. A friend needs me. You won't tell Jean-Michel? If there are clients... Don't worry, I'll handle them. Look! You want to end up like that? I used to be on the streets. I was a whore. At first it seemed easy. Then I needed more and more money! Then I met a pimp and my life became a nightmare. Do you know what they did? They put me there! In a box behind a window, like a piece of meat at the butcher's. You don't understand, Katia. I'll never get caught up in that! It's just for another fortnight. It's not for the money, it's for him. So we can start a new life! What life, my girl? An awful life, a rotten life. Whores don't have a life. And your pimp, you know where he'll end up? - In prison! - Leave me alone! If anything happens to him, I'm warning you, Katia, I'll kill you! I swear, I'll kill you! I don't want to see you again. Leave me alone! Get lost or I'll cut your face you pig! - You don't scare me. - Give my money back then! You should have told me you were pervert. It's not the same price. Call the cops. Not the cops! Get lost! I've told Jean-Michel. I keep on telling, we need someone to protect us. You never know. I give him enough money! You're doing it for him too? Shit! I shouldn't have told you. He'll be cross. Why are you looking at me like that? You didn't know? You could have guessed. With Charlotte, that makes three of us. She's coming back tomorrow. He's gone to fetch her. I'm getting dressed. You make me sick, Jean-Michel. What's the matter, baby? Why do you say that? Because you're a crummy pimp! And I'm a dirty whore! Stop this crap! Alright? Elsa is working for you, and Charlotte. With me, that's three little whores! Are you crazy? I'm helping them out, that's all. And you and me it's different. Stop calling me a pimp, that really freaks me out! What are you then? Stop bullshitting! What am I doing? Where does the money go? With us it's different. It's just for a time. Just to make a new start. We won't do this forever. How many have you sweet-talked like this? You told them all you loved them? You're the worst bastard I've ever met! Stop saying that, it makes me mad! Don't touch me! Not another man, do you hear? I won't do it for you anymore! I touch you when I want. Understood? You do what I say. - You're mine! - Stop it! I do what I like! Go on, kill me! I'll never do it with you again! Take off your clothes! Wait, I'll help you. Anyway, I don't feel anything. I'll do the same as with the clients. Pretend you aren't there. Don't move. I love you, Chloe. We don't need other people. It's just you and me. I don't now how I can still feel for you. - Is that you, Jean-Michel? - No, it's me. You can't sleep here. A client might come back drunk. That's why he got you a room. I don't give a damn! I hate that filthy room. I'm fed up with everything. I'm fed up of being humped by those pigs for him. You were right, he has never loved me. It's the same old trick. We all fall for it. I've still got he marks from the beating he gave me. I can't stop thinking about him, I keep waiting for him. There's worse than him. If only you knew. Right! One last client. Don't wait for J.M., he wont' be back tonight. But he said... Is he with Charlotte? - I don't' know. - I can't go on. I'm going to kill myself. I'm fed up of him taking me for a fool! You know where he is. Tell me where he is. Elsa. You know where he is. I must see him! Everything I've done for him has meaning if he's gone. Tell me where he is! Stop bugging me with this! He said you'd tell me where he is. Tell me where he's hiding! He stopped hiding long ago. He says one thing to you, another to me. You know he's never on the level. It's like when he gets beat up. You never know if it's for real. If you knew the number of times he's been beaten up just to fool us... That's how we all become whores the first time. Is that true? He did that? To you? To the others? Tell me where he is. It's all there but you're late. Aldo doesn't like that. Make sure it doesn't turn in to a habit. We're fed up of having to smash up your crummy club. What are you doing here? Still in trouble? Yes, with Aldo. He won't leave me be. He'll never leave me alone. He won't leave me alone either. Don't you still owe me some money? Don't bother me with that. You'll get your money back! When? In the spring. That's what we agreed, didn't we? You can't come in you're underage. What are you doing together? You're screwing her too? Are you working for him too? You're a real bastard! And you're a bitch, Katia! I hate you! I hate you both! Let go of me, will you? Chloe, wait for me! So you're her pimp! Do you know how old that girl is? She's isn't yet 16. Tell me where you're hiding her, or I'll file a complaint and have you put in gaol! File a complaint against whom? What for? You can't prove anything. They'll take you for a madwoman. Watch, Katia! You know what happens to squealers! Where did you meet that girl anyway? It's none of your business. Not that one! Shit! I swear I'll grass on you. Do you understand? There are plenty of girls on the streets. You're wrong. I need her, or else I'm dead! Go ahead and die! You should have died ages ago! You walk the streets, you'll see if you like it! You must help me, Katia. I promised her to Aldo. Why Aldo? Because I owe him money. He has Dutch clients looking for young girls for the Middle East. It's illegal, do you hear? So what? You want to take her place? Are you stupid or what? Haven't I warned you against borrowing from Aldo? What do you care? Why do you care about this girl? I don't know. I care about her. I hardly know her but I care about her. Look, once I've given her to Aldo, I'll have settled my debt. I'll be able to make a new start, I'll leave you alone. It's simple. Listen carefully. Just tell me when you see her. You'll tell me? Don't count on me. Ever! You disappoint me, I've always treated. you properly. I've always liked you. I've done you favours. You know what'll happen if you do that? If it's war you want, you'll get it. Poor fool! Are you hungry? You look hungry. I'll give you my sandwich. You can eat it all if you let me caress you a little. Excuse me, I... You look so nice, so gentle. I don't want to hurt you, I just want to caress you, that's all. Ahmed? - Can I stay with you? I've nowhere to go. - What? Are you hustling out here? I don't want a whore in my place. Chloe! Wait... You might need this. I don't want you money! Can I stay with you a while? You look exhausted. I haven't slept for several nights. If you like, rest a while on the bed. I'll get something to eat, alright? Don't worry, you'll soon feel better, OK? Take a bath. Then we'll see what we can do. Yes, we'll see... I'm broke, but I can't go on doing it. It disgusts me. I'll be right back. Rest. Come on, we're going. Get in. You fooled me, Jean-Michel. You lied to me from the start. You never loved me. I don't know how to love, I never have. I tried with you, I even thought I loved you. How can I love a girl who gets laid by everyone? You think I'm like those fools who pay to screw you? Where are we going? You're going to live and work in Holland. I have partners who'll buy you. You'll get your share, I'll get mine. What if I refuse? You'll sort it out with them. When you see them, I think you'll accept. You're a bastard, Jean-Michel. I don't see it that way. It's like poker. We've played, there are winners and losers. It's no big deal. Come on. Chloe? Come here. You betrayed me, Katia! It's not true. Jean-Michel was just a small-time crook I knew. There was nothing between us. I want to die. It hurts too much. Chloe, please! I want to die. I'm ashamed of myself. I feel ashamed. Shame is worse than anything. I've given everything, Katia! I've given everything! I can't fall any lower. There's no way out for me, I have to die! No, Chloe!
