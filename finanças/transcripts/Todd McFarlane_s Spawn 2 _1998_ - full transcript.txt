"Where do the dead belong... in the world of the living". "For this newest spawn moments of peace never come". "His memories are fragments of the life he once had". "For a Hellspawn, memories will play... his soul's own personal hell". Hey, you're going to have to speak up, Al. If you want to be heard. Boy, what are you doing, tough guy? Let me guess. You're just now remembering who torched your sorry ass. I love it when that happens. Time for you to learn something from all this, Spawn. No one can be trusted. This world isn't about trust. It's about dominance and submission. It's about power! It's never about trust. I mean you couldn't even trust your sweet little Wanda with... good old Terry, right? You're alone now, Spawn. Ain't no one covering your back anymore. I love it when you get rough. Go on, do it! Let yourself go, Spawn. You got the killing fever. "Winter has brought the Hunter's Moon... with its cold white to light." "The Hunter's Moon is so bright... that predators choose this night for the hunt." "And tonight, in the alleys... Spawn can sense that he is the hunted one". Hey, Al, come on over. It's warm by the fire. "The Hellspawn hides himself away... with that instinct which predators have". "Away from weariness, confusion and torment". "They choose solitude". "Hiding in the shadows". They are not your enemies. - They are the only friends you have. - Friends? They are my enemies! "A Hellspawn is returned to earth, soulless". "His mind ravaged, his memory shattered". They took everything from me! They made me a monster. Mr. Amir, with your country's reputation... no one in the free world will sell you these kinds of weapons. Except for me. 400 million wins you a war. Wynn, you're a beautiful man. You start a war and then sell arms to both sides. Whoever wins, you're his new best friend. You have your directives. It's not working for me. The alley location doesn't make sense. Missile fragments were found in those alley. Serial numbers match our missing weapons. Let's get something clear right now. I own you, I'm not interested in how you think things should work. Understood? And Special Ops has recon the target for you. Why am I wasting my time with this bullshit? We got guns in practically every third world country. What's so special about these? I need those guns off the street, Chapel. That ordinance is traceable to me. Chapel, did you hear what I said? Tonight. I've never seen a moon like that. Weird shit always happen when we have a moon like that. - Get down! - I don't like it. My God. Shit! Alright, now that I have everybody's attention. Let's get this over with real quick, okay. There were weapons fired in this alley. They look like this. One was a shoulder-fired missile it makes a big noise. I'm sure you would remember it. Tell me where they are or I'll put your worthless... piece of shit life out of your misery. I don't know. No. I think you're smart, old fart. Now let's just see how high that IQ of yours is. Tell me where the guns are. But I don't know. Maybe Al. Al? Is Al the the guy... who knows things around here? Okay. Let's go talk to Al. Hey, you're going to have to speak up if you want to be heard. Jesus. He was just a kid. Never thought this job would come to this. What? You're going to have to speak up, Kid... if you want to be heard. It's not just a job. It's an adventure. Al. - Night, Angel. - Night. Night. Every night you put Cyan to sleep and then you go back to the agency. Are you going to tell me what's going on? I want to keep you safe, Baby. - The less you know, the better. - I don't understand these stuff. You're a desk jockey. A nice safe job. I like knowing I won't get a phone call in the night... saying you're missing or dead. I think I found something that they didn't want me to find. And sometimes there's an agency inside the agency... keeping a lot of secrets. But... I'll get it all straightened out. I have to go. Be careful. Wanda. I forgot something. - I love you. - I love you too. I'll always come home to you. Don't worry. Come on, Amos, tell me what you know. I don't know. Look at that. Broken glass. Good as a scalpel. Don't. The guns. Our guns, Amos! It's not like you're protecting the family jewels. But hey, I could cut those off too. Well. What have we here? Al. Al. Are you, Al? What is this, Gay Pride Day or something? Hey, I like the mask, but I think the cape is a little much. Why the hell would you do that? Stand up and I'll show you. Son of a bitch! It's you. Chapel. I remember you. It's okay, Amos. I got you. - What the fuck? - Jess Chapel. Joliet, Illinois, right? Say what? That's where the state prison is. Where you were born. Jess Chapel. Who the fuck are you? Your worst fucking nightmare. Say it! Al? Yeah, we know each other real well. I know you buried that girl in Guatemala. I even know about that singer in Rio. Don Juan of killers you said. You're not him... You're not him! Why don't you tell me who I am? Tell me. Tell me who I am! Simmons? I want you to feel what it's like... trapped in a box no light, no air. Suffocating in the darkness and left to rot. Jesus Christ. Okay. Internal investigation records entry 75. Tracking shipments of ground-to-air Patriot missiles... to client countries. Now running the numbers on TOW missiles. Israel-Kuwait database confirmation of serial numbers... ordinance shipped and received? I guess the world sleeps safely tonight. But I don't trust numbers. Let's see if a satellite can verify. Cross-referencing global positioning. No signal. No position given. Jesus, those missiles never arrived. One of my own. Give me a name. Cerebus, that's a deep black project. Bypassing security codes. Someone removed the transmitter. Where the hell are these weapons? Fitzgerald. Shit! Terry? Terry? No one cares about that, come on! Can you hear me, come on? What you doing? He's dead! The whole fucking building fell on him. Shit! I trusted you with my life. A hundred times. We were partners, Jess. Brother! Come on, Jess. Work the scenario. Just like the old days. Show me why you did it! You take off the lens cap? Wynn sent me to find you. Said you're gonna be my albatross. I think you're called a partner. So you're the one who took a bullet for liberal. I guess that's dedication, all right. The president's a president. Is that right? In covert ops, maybe not always. What's so funny? I'm here because I killed the fuckin' assassin. You know, the one you let get away. You were the only one I let in. I trusted you. Why? You stupid son of a bitch. You were always the target! From the day we met, my job was to whack you. When the time came. Who gave the order? Who was it? It was Wynn. He gave me the order, but I wanted to do it. Wynn? Guess I won. I won. Know me. Jesus Christ! No! You're not him! Touch it. It's real. Feel it, you made it. No, you can't be alive. I'm not, asshole. You took everything from me. Hey, you have to speak up, Al, if you want to be heard. God. Simmons. Kill me. Kill me! Finish it. There's no coming back. No. I'm going to let you live. Longer than you want to. No. You can't do this to me! I killed him. I killed him and he came back from the dead. No one can come back! But he... he did. Why, Jess? - Why? - They're coming back. I've killed them. Look, they're coming back. I've killed them. They keep coming back! I've killed them, but they come back. He keeps coming back. I will die for you. "Born out of darkness, a hell spawn is isolated... confused... tormented". "He finds no solace in his own thoughts". "They are distorted, twisted, grotesque". "Whatever fragments of memories that remain... are not his own". "They are intruders". "Memories are his enemy". I always wanted you, Wanda. Terry, you're more of a man than Al ever was. I'm glad we got rid of that son of a bitch. God. Terry. No! Stay out of my dreams! Your dreams? Malebolgia owns you. You are his bitch. You know what I've said. Nothing but a cheap sin than a bad complexion. Don't you get it, Spawny? Your friends all fucked ya! This is getting embarrassing this Wanda fetish you have. I don't want to hear her name from your filthy mouth! Yes! Nice shot, Spawny! But I think you're dealing with some misplaced anger here. Don't get pissed at me. I'm the one who's helping you out. And I'm not the one who stole your wife. But hey, think about it. Just how well did you know Terry anyway. Terry... Why don't we have Fitzgerald shake hands with Mr. Amir... they're such old friend. - What are we really looking at here? - A traitor, Mr. Bergen. And he's about to be dealt with. What some men will do for money, it's a travesty. Selling missiles to a known terrorist. - The voice? - The voice is even easier... than the visual, Mr. Wynn. Psychological profile? Paranoid, delusional. It reads like a Greek tragedy. Shame how quickly a man can crash and burn. Splendid observation, Bergen. I suggest you keep it in mind should you ever be tempted... to sharpen your skills. I'm aware of your reputation, sir. Of course, you are. Your fee has already been wired. - Yes? - Fitzgerald on the loose. I want my missiles moved out of that warehouse tonight. Right now. Merrick will have coordinates for delivery. And... send me Leon, now. Fitzgerald is a traitor... and how does our agency handle traitors? They're liquidated. I want you to use Leon and that hillbilly kid. I don't trust that hillbilly. He worked for the Russian mob. I trust him. Hi. You've been gone for hours, baby, what's wrong? I've been walking around... thinking. I just I want to see you inside and tell you that I might... might be gone a few days. What's going on? I feel like my whole life is elapsing around me. Terry, talk to me. I'm tired. I'm just so tired. I can't think straight. - I have to go. - Now? Terry, it's 3.00AM. You have a wife and a child. - Let someone else take care of it. - I'm all alone on this. You're doing fieldwork, like Al did. Don't lay that on me, Wanda. You've got to trust me. - I have to do this. - Trust? Don't ask a widow for blind trust. I trust with my eyes wide open. So, you better tell me what's going on, right now! I can't. I'm trying to protect you. "Al used to say the same thing". "You're not protecting me". "You're scaring me". "I won't raise a fatherless child, Terry". "Thanks for all the support". "But I have to go". He's en route. Where's he going? On the way to the warehouse. You won't be killing him, he's mine. Hey, Buddy, you okay? Holy shit. Unit 12. I need backup. Riverside and 10th. Ten of hours to bring in one guy? What is he, dusted? No drugs in his system. The doctor seems to feel there is some sort of brain damage. Shit, where they picked this guy up? The alleys where we're investigating those murders, Sir. - Coincidence? - I don't believe in coincidences. Neither do I, Sir. Right down there. Shit. Well, there's the problem right there. He's just too much makeup. That could drive a guy nuts. Ritualistic markings very primal, yes. African warriors use similar markings. The skull signifies death. Looks military. Special Forces training. No tags. - Mercenary maybe. - His fingerprints... have been burned off. It'll be hard to make a positive ID. Looks like we got ourselves a real pro. Al! Christ! No! I killed him! Do you hear me? I killed him! Do you hear me, I killed him! Confession of a fruitcake. Probably nothing. Check the alleys for another body anyway. There's nothing left but you comeback you've gone... Yes? We just picked up one of your boys. A trigger man with a skull painted on his face, sound familiar? I want him cut loose. I don't think you do. He looks like he's been through a war. Guys a fucking time bomb. All right. I'll attend to it myself. Chapel. Another disappointment. Who the fuck are you? Get your hands off me! Selling arms to a terrorist. That was an improper thing to do, Mr. Fitzgerald. This is bullshit! Of course it is. Anything more to say? You can't just... You just resisted arrest. Holy shit! Call in B-team. Fitzgerald's got backup. Hello, Leon. He's got help. Kill both of them. Move away from the desk. Now drop your gun belt. Put your hands behind your back. How many people are here? Just a couple this shift, it's mostly automated. Cut the phones and the security. This was supposed to be a piece of action... now suddenly we have wet works inside a building... I have no blueprints for, Merrick. I'll be your eyes and ears, Leon. I don't like a woman watching my back, they're too soft. Not Merrick. We did a hard contract against a Russian mob. She got a hit and left behind. - They used her badly. - I'd like to use her badly. You talk too much. Shit! Hey wait! Shit. I have to find those missiles. It's the only way out of this mess. Come on. It's have to be in here. Yes! Got them. Shit! Hey, you have to call the police. Lady. "I don't know if you boys have noticed... but our target is about to escape". "If you take your thumbs out of your asses... you might be able to catch him". He's up there. This old boy is a hard dog to keep under the porch. When I catch this little Jackrabbit, I'm going to skin him. Don't underestimate this guy. He's a boy scout, he doesn't know what he's going to do next. I know some of those Russians, who were they? Don't know, after America was done with them... they couldn't identify the bodies. Jesus! I'm just doing my job, goddammit. Why are they doing this to me? Hey, Little rabbit. You down the rabbit hole? What are you waiting for? Pop him. The asshole took your old lady. He torched you, you dumb shit. As sure as if it was his hand and the torch... he needed you gone. Come on. If ever there was a motive that every fucking body understand... it was "He took my woman." I need him alive, Until I know the truth. Let's see. "Beautiful young woman desires generous man for new situation". Not bad. Open Vault 73. And then go for the cops. There it is. Holy shit. These are the numbers. The numbers match. Jesus. Wynn. He's a traitor. Got him. Too bad, Little lady, wrong turn. Give me the truth. Al, if I knew who did it, I'll take them down. I'll take care of it, Buddy, I promised. Good luck up there. It's true. You didn't know. This is a little very messy. I keep a clean house. Leave. Or we all go. I've got nothing to lose. You won't do it. You don't have the balls. Desk jockey. That's your whole problem. You're just not the type. Goddamnit! So, what? So, you gave him permission, so he didn't know. Did he have to screw her? He could've been platonic, right? Did he have to slam it to her every night? Every year I asked them to keep his grave better. And every year they let it go to seed. Terry, don't leave me the way he did. Promise me no field assignments. Hey. I won't leave you. I'm a desk jockey and I'm proud of it. Al was my best friend. He only asked me to do one thing for him... take care of you. I promised him I would. He's laying over there. Hey, Boy scout, you made that fun. Shit! You're not going to die on this roof. Take care of Wanda Until I come for her. "This time, the Hellspawn kept the demons at bay". "But he knows they will always return". "To torment him". "Making him blind". "To the truth". You let him go? Why? What did you say? You! Old bum! When you let him go, you took a step toward freeing yourself. How the hell do you know? How do you know any of it? I know. You're not the only one touched by this curse. Who are you? "In the city... a river of humanity rushes past". "Leaving behind in the alleys, the refuges". "Those that become lost in the mind". "The sick and the broken". "Spawn shares this alley with the lost souls, who like him... long to escape their wounded and tormented existence". "Does he feel anything at all?" "Or is his heart dark and empty?" "With no shreds of humanity left". "Is the Hellspawn even aware that his presence... causes the destruction of those closest to him?" "Those he had hoped... to protect". Everyone's in place, Merrick. "Wynn still inside with the wife". "If Fitzgerald comes home, wait until when walks out... ...and then kill them all". Wanda, you've created quite a stir at the NSC. I don't like getting the runaround. This has become a very dangerous situation for Terry. Who knows what he's capable of doing. He needs to turn himself in, Wanda. He's not a criminal. You and I both know that. But his behavior. It's erratic. - He's stressed. - You love him. But to the NSC, he's considered a traitor. That is not Terry. I hope it's not. If he calls you here, you must tell him to contact me. I'm his only hope. You've already lost one husband... and it would be a shame to lose another. Hey, you're having a rough one? - Saying something? - A rough night. You don't want to know. - You want to talk about it? - No thanks. - Going to use the phone. - Sorry, I didn't mean it... Don't worry about it. If you hear anything, Jason, please call me. Hello? Hey, good luck! What's this fucking box. Damn, this is good. Thing about donuts, they're all this vitamins of dozen. I don't want to see anymore of you, fucking bums. You scared our customers away! We' trying to do business here, all right? Tell your buddies I don't want to see a single goddamn bum in this alley. You stink, man! Don't you have any respect for yourself? Personal offense for made me smell you. Come on, sticks, let's go! Let's get out of here, man. Jesus! That was close. - Please don't hurt me. - Okay, police. - Please. - It's okay, Hank. It's us. Please don't hurt me. - Easy. - Wait. Easy does it, Hank. What's going on down here, Hank? He's going to come down and destroy you. He's coming. You'll see he's coming. and going to destroy you. - He needs to sleep it off. - You'll see. You watch! He's not going to let this go in vain. You'll see. That's a paranoid schizophrenia, Sir. You'll see. He... He will protect us! That's great. Add that to the heap of weird shit... going on down here. You're going to see something! Everyone will see. He's coming. Judgement. He's coming... Excuse us. - Watch it! - You watch it. We have to do it, man. Have you two thought about my offer? You'll make a lot of money with me doing the Lord's work. Shit, man. Hey, you. Who's your man? Grab some fence. Yeah, you need to stay right there. Hey, Preacher man, aren't you recruiting... kind of young these days? We all work for the Lord. Yeah, work dead. You don't understand our work here. You're going to leave those kids alone, you hear me? You're going to get the hell out of here. I think they got religion, Sir. Cops. What a fucking joke. That wasn't the cop who force Johnny and his boys out. It was some kind of ghost who scared him off. You know, Johnny was Creole. They're always spooked by shit like that. We own these alleys now. I want a steel door, bars on the windows. And get rid of the bums. Next. Brother. Are you seeking salvation? Hey. What is this? - We don't take checks. - That's right, Mr. Wall Street. Cash only to be saved. You already sniff all your stocks and bonds up your nose? It's cash only, asshole. Bless you, sister. Let me ease your pain. In the end... they are all lust for hell. What the hell. Hey! Hey, why you running out, Dude Cinderella? No one listens to me. I hate it when people don't listen to me. Won't be needing guns for this. Easy, Danny boy. My brother just want you... to rough them up like last time. I warned you, freaks. You didn't listen to me. This is our alley now. Let me go! I... I won't bother you! Man, you made me look like a boat in front of my brother, man. I can't take that. What? Come here! The Guardian's going to take care of you! No. God. Joe. He used to sing me songs. Joe was nice to me. God. We came here because of The Guardian. He was going to protect us. I don't know, Lucy. Maybe they were just stories. No. He's our angel. Our guardian angel. He's ours, he knows how we feel... because he's like us. Maybe Joe didn't believe. You have to believe him, Arnie, or he won't come. That's what you're supposed to do. Poor Joe. Why do we have to throw him away like this. The water is so dirty and cold. No. Please. Please. Please no. Please don't. please. Take Lucy away. Lucy, let's go. Joe's going to be okay, Lucy. No one can heard him now. Yeah. That's right. No one can heard you now, Joe. Two whole months? I wish I didn't have to go. Well, how about something nice... to remember me by? Where is he? He was supposed to protect us. Judgement. - Hey, it's me, Hank. - You scared the shit out of me, man. Hey, could I have a drink, man, please. Thanks. Easy. Man, you said you're the one who told us about him. Why isn't he here? Is he going to do anything? Like a cops or... Maybe he's not real, just more of your your drunk talk. - He's real, Hank. - I'm telling you. He's bullshit, Gareb! It's him! It's real... There you are. Hey, Al. I've been looking for you. Hey, wait. Wait. You hear what happened to us? That gang. They went and the sons of bitches went kill Joe. Bastards killed him. Al, help us, we have to do something. What should I do with them? Kill... I mean, I don't know what I mean. Get rid of them! I don't do other people's killings anymore, Gareb. I feel nothing for you or the others. This place has the stink of Hell all over it. I'm good to no one... I can't even help the ones I care about. Al, we're all just scared! Al, please, I've told everybody that you will help us, protect us. There's so many of us here now. We're trapped here just like you. Prisoners. - Answer the question, Shad. - Please, I... I'm looking for someone. One of my disciples, real skinny guy. No... I... I... - Well... - Answer him. He's got something of mine, it's my Bible... and it's very important to me. The Guardian, why don't you ask him? The Guardian? Brother, I'm your only Savior in these alleys. A real smart ass? Have you seen the skinny guy? And I know if you're lying. I haven't seen him. If you do see him, come and find me. - Let's go. - Arnie. Arnie? Well, what have we here. Maybe this one there was something. Is that yours? That is one big piece of ass, man. Arnie, are these your friends? Right, Baby. We're friends. Yeah, that's it. We're all friends here. - Right, - Yeah. Hey, Arnie why don't you dance with her? Please. Please, leave us alone. Let's go, Donny. Leave us alone, is that right? - Lucy. No! - Come on, Baby, dance. - I like to dance, Arnie. - Lucy come on! Yeah, show me those legs, that's it. The old broad's wasted. Lucy! Do it! Yeah! Do it! Baby! Yeah! Lucy. - Lucy - He's playing music for me, Arnie. Enough! - Hey, what the fuck? - Enough you little shit - Let's go, Donny boy. - I'm just having a little fun. Donny, before that old guy kicks your ass. You think you could come in here and push us around, humiliate us? We're not leaving. You're not a nice man. The Guardian's going to get you. No! Hey. Lighten up, Donny boy. You go give your guardian that message, old man. Lucy. Lucy. Move! Move! Lucy... Why don't we bury her like we do the others? No! She was afraid of the sewers, it's cold there. I promised her I'd always keep her warm. "Cast out of society". "Taking refuge amidst the garbage like Spawn himself". "These unclaimed souls know they will never be accepted... by the world beyond these alleys". "So, they remain here". "Trying to hold on to their dignity and sanity". "Hoping for some savior". "A protector, someone to redeem them". You pathetic piece of shit. You're smoking all the merchandise. Come here. I'll kick your scrawny ass. Where is the fucking book? Wait, I got it right here, man. Relax. You're all... You know, you worry too much, man. The fuck? Where the hell are they? - What are you going to do? - I'm going to go find... those two rat fucks right now and the goddamn Bible... so we can all get back to fucking work. Yeah, well, I'm coming with you. Stay put. Earl? Sticks? Show your face, you chicken shit. Yes. I got you, you son of a bitch. I got you! Donny Boy, it's going to be okay. I'll get you out of here. Donny! Get up! Who are you? You... you bastard! You killed my brother! You're going to die! "Has this Hellspawn found some scrap of humanity within himself?" "Or is this the act of a predator whose territory has been invaded?" "Has his basic instinct to kill taken hold of him?" "He knows he has lost again". "The real Victor here is the one... who sent him to harvest more souls". "The dream is always the same". "We are pale riders in the night, carrying the swords of justice... as was done when men first put on the hoods... and set the cross on fire". "For all to see and fear". "One more of the outsiders has been brought to justice". "Those who have taken our homes and jobs... defiled our country". "And our God". "I know now what the dream really means". "I am to prepare the way for the one who is coming". "I see his face every night". "We share the same dream". "The master told me what I had to do". "He speaks to me and I know his name". "He calls himself Malebolgia". Please, Sir, no smoking in cab. - Please forgive me. - No problem. Where are you going tonight? - I'm going to Brooklyn. - Brooklyn, okay. "I am the one to cleanse and purify this city". "To rid us of them". "They're not like us, but they can't really help themselves". "They don't even know why this must happen". Please... Why are you doing this? I don't understand. I'm sorry. I know it is not your fault. And it's really nothing personal. "It is not just the lost and dispossessed... that have gathered near the Hellspawn". "There are those lone predators. "The human monsters". "Those who have heard the voice of Malebolgia... whispering to them". "Evil has seeped into their empty lives... like a stained a liquid". "Aware of the presence of the Hellspawn... they come to the alleys to be near him". "They are drawn to him". "He is their Savior, their link to the master". "Hell has sent them to be Malebolgia's hands". "Covered with blood". I've found you. Get away from me. Only makes it a business to know where her husband is. - She knows she's being watched. - Why is this woman still alive? Let me take her and the kid. I'll know where Fitzgerald is in an hour. And if she really doesn't know, you would have cut it to pieces. I'll find him, don't worry. Yes? You wanted us to check in, sir? Yes, Raymond what have you got? She hasn't left her office all day. She spoke with her grandmother her daughter, several clients... "and you". She's clever, this one. You know I'm good in voice stress analysis. Let me be there. Next to you. She's not a pro, I know when she's lying. If I feel like she's lying, you can take her. Ask her about her daughter, is she missing a daddy. A mother won't lie about her kids feelings. Wanda. It's after 9PM, why are you still here? I've got some briefs to catch up on. Honey, why don't you bother legate the cases to somebody else? At least til you hear about... Terry. Thanks, Lois, but I have to stay busy... or I lose my mind for sure. Well Okay, see you tomorrow. If you need anything, let me know, okay? Night Good night, Lois. - Wanda Blake. - "Wanda". Jason Wynn. - "Jason, anything new?" - Yes, can you meet me for dinner? Of course I can. - Where do you want me to meet you? - I'll send a car around... to pick you up. "All right". - I'll be downstairs in 10 minutes. - "See you then". - You look exhausted. - No sleep. I have the same dreams every night. "There's been a recent string of disappearances... all in the Brooklyn area". "Police are investigating, but there are no lead at this time... and they're asking for the public's help". "The most recent disappearance is local cab driver, Joseph Weiss". "If you've seen this man or have any information... as to his work, please call the number on the screen". I didn't get the money again. Yeah, I swear. I swear I will never do it again. Please, Baby, come get me. Hey, what are you looking at? fuck off! Astoria Queens, please. Astoria it is. Thank you, Honey. It's beautiful. Surreal. Happy Anniversary, Baby. Hey, excuse me, Astoria in Queens, not Brooklyn. I'm sorry, the traffic on the Triboro bridge... What do we look like, tourists? Stop the cab. I said stop the cab right now and let us out! Hey, man look... I only got 50 bucks, it's yours, just... Just let us out of here, okay? I apologize, but it has to be this way. No. Don't! No, please, don't! I really am sorry. As his lawyer, I'd like to know if my husband is... being charged with a crime. I think this can be resolved in Terry's faith. Don't get my hopes up, Jason. Unless you are sure. I'll always tell the truth, Wanda. So How are you making out? How's Cyan? It's... tough on the kid. She cries for Terry every night and I try to stay busy at work... and... try to keep myself together for her but I do my own share of crying. I'm sorry I didn't mean to dump my problems on you. It's all right, Wanda. I know it's tough. But I'll be here as long as you need me to be. I just want Terry home. So do I. Is that him? Is that the one you want? - Problem? - No. I just have to make a call. You can use my phone. No thank you. This is a private call. I'll use one of the payphones. Excuse me. She's lying. Wanda. Terry, where are you? Our old club in Brooklyn. I can be there in 30 minutes. I'll be waiting in front. Terry... I love you. I love you too. I'm sorry, Cyan's not feeling well. I have to go. I hope it's nothing serious. She's been running a high fever. Thank you for everything, I'll take a cab. No. I won't adhere of it. Merrick. Will you see Miss Blake to the car please? - All right. - No problem, Ma'am. I'll call you, Jason. Good night, Wanda. Be careful. Traced her call to a payphone in Brooklyn. Where is she now? On the Manhattan Bridge, heading into Brooklyn. "Keep me posted". You're awake, that's better. Please forgive all this, I really don't blame you. And none of us chooses... what we were born to be. Yes? Excellent. Brooklyn. Interesting. One of the Charles credit cards were just traced in Brooklyn. Son of a bitch has been in our backyard all this time. And Blake is on her way there now. What? "She keeps circling the same couple of blocks". Real slow. "Pull her over until I get there". No! Please step out of the car. What's this about? Please don't make this difficult. - Who are you? What do you want? - Get out of the car. - No, I won't! - Listen to me. You don't have a choice. What? Go check it out. Please get out of the car, Miss. What? Hey, what? Yeah, nothing. Come on! God! God! No! No! No! Come on! Come on! No! No! - Wanda... - No! - Wanda. - No, get away! Wanda! Wanda! No! I'm sorry, it took a bit longer than I expected. No. This isn't supposed to happen this way. I know you're here. There's no place to go. You fuck with the wrong guy. You sick little twerp! Come on, now. It's time to take your place among the others. He told me it has to be this way. Does he think he can fuck with me? With my plans? You would've killed her too if you had the chance. Who's that? Who's there? I have a bad feeling about this. Where the hell are Raymond and Watts? Do you see what I've done here? This was for the master, I've saved them for you. I don't serve any master. Do you think our master will be pleased? Why don't you ask him yourself? You're about to meet him. My dream... My savior. He betrayed me. Press is going to have a field day with this. I counted there were 12 people swinging from the rafters up there. One of them was a sick fuck who did all the killing. It's like someone's did us a favor. But who killed him? He didn't hang himself. There's another cycle running around out there. The City's going to hell. Triggers these guys anyway, killing all those innocent people. Jesus. Two of the victims were agents from the NSC. No wonder this place is crawling with Feds. What the hell? Lady! Let's get that car out of here! Okay, you're clear. Back her up. Chief Banks, Wanda Blake was the last person... ...to see my agents alive. Find her, Fitzgerald could be with her. My people are collecting the bodies. Now, I want their identities withheld. As far as the press concerned, they were never there. Two agents slaughtered and put on display. Are you ready for this? He was there. Fitzgerald couldn't have done all that alone. Of course he couldn't. This is getting too strange and costly. That DC game you're playing was beautiful, Baby. That was pretty. - Shit! - Look out! Goddamn lady! Damn, Lady! where'd you learn how to drive? About kill me and shit. - Are you guys okay? - Yeah, we all right. May I see a driver's license and registration. Raymond and Watts were torn apart... and then dragged up seven flights of stairs. There's a second killer. - Wynn. - "It's Banks". "One of my cops just pulled over Wanda Blake". - "She's a few blocks from you". - Where's Fitzgerald? "No sign of him. What do we do with her?" Do not detain her. Fitzgerald must still be in the area. Find him now.. You know, Jason. Someone's out there. You must have friends in pretty high places, Miss Blake. What? Go home, Ma'am. And try not to kill anyone getting there, okay? She was afraid of me. Who are you believing? Her, yourself? You cannot have that life back. When Al Simmons died... all hopes of a future with Wanda died with him. You have been born into another existence. A chance to regain your humanity. It's there and only there where your choices lie. She's seen the creature I've become. That's all she knows. Her only memory of me. This is truly what hell is, old man. - You have a chance to... - A chance? What chance? I have nothing here anymore! No escape, not even death! You see? I can't even end it. I would trade anything... do my life over again in the world's worst shithole... than to be here, now, like this! I know what you're going through. The pain that you feel. How could you possibly know, old man? Because I have endured it and survived. Do you think your fate is sealed? Are you going to accept the shroud that's been placed around you? I can't go on like this anymore. Hiding in the shadows... I'm sick of it. I have to let her know... who I am. How can you tell her that... when you don't even know yourself. Tomorrow's headlines will be traitor shoot wife and child. After all, he was distraught. - You have Fitzgerald's gun? - Yes and his prints too. Banks has every cop in Brooklyn looking for Fitzgerald. - We should have him by morning. - I'd like to finish this... myself. Use an independent contractor, someone outside the agency. Jason, I said I'll do it. No, my best agents are coming back in body bags. Someone is out there and they're getting closer. I want you to find them, Merrick, before they find me. You look spooked. Won't let anything happen to you. Here we go. Please, Miss Wu. Some of us would like to go home. I'm almost done. Last time I do you a favor, goddamnit. Interesting. I think it's time I had a talk with Wanda Blake. The scene in Brooklyn is pretty grim. We have another monsters handiwork to sort out. Media's gone apeshit. And the politics on this one... gentlemen, the politics are heavy. So bag and tag everything, by the book. Make a note of everything that doesn't belong there. We are working two major crime scenes. We have some badly decomposed bodies in the alleys off 42nd Street. My guess, the missing drug dealers. All right, go be New York's finest. - Let's get this done. - Let's get this guy. You know, to each of those ten represents a body... found in that alley. You know what pisses me off, this has to happen in our precinct. I absolutely agree, Sir. About fucking time to go into those alleys. I know something's in there. How many reports do we have... to write, Twitch? Too many, Sir. I'm sure the locals... will appreciate their concern. Place is a ghost town. You see all those body bags? This Alley and the guns going off... Please, Honey. Where are you? Wanda. Hey, you, over there. Yes, officer, is there a problem? Can I help you? - What are you doing out here? - I was looking for a phone. - Call my wife. - He fits the description. This could be our guy, be careful. Could you stop showing the light on my face, please? Excuse me. Could you get that light out of my eyes? Can you tell me where there's a phone? I just can't... seem to find one that works? What happened to your clothes? You've been fighting? You've been drinking? Is there a law against having a drink? - I'm not driving. - Sir. You see anything unusual in the last couple of hours or so? Unusual? What do you mean by unusual? Hear any loud noises, screams, shots... anything out of the ordinary? No, otherwise I would've called the cops. May I see some ID, Sir? ID? Yeah, sure. Right here, Man, I seem to lost my wallet. We're going to have to ask you to come with us. I haven't broken any laws. Just come with us, please. What for? I'm telling you I need to call my wife She'll come get me. I haven't done anything. - I was at a bar. - What bar, where? Is that we had the fight? No. I just need to call my wife! Lie down on the street, right now! Hands out, at your side, now. "Hello, this is Lisa. Sorry I can't take your call". "But leave me a message and I'll call you back... as soon as I can". "Lisa, I know you're there, pick up". "I'm so used to talking to this damn thing anyway". "Okay". "I want you to join the circus". "This Brooklyn serial killer's story is going to sell a ton of papers". "I mean, this guy was strung up next to his victims". "There's my front-page". "Stop covering dead-end alley story". "Switch all your attention over to this". I'm hunting another monster. "By the way, I got your compensation for the deepthroat... you're working with in NSC". "Someday you're going to have to let me know who it is". "Must be somebody pretty high up". - Let's go, move it. - The civilian's out. Set up a perimeter. - Okay. - And do it now. Step back, there's nothing to look at here, Sir. Where do you think you're going? It was nothing to look at here. Move it another block. Excuse me, Miss, I can't let you do that. But what are they looking for? I can't tell you that. Now move along please if you would. Thanks for the help. Maybe the locals know something. Okay, what's up with the guys in the moon suits? Looks like they're invading these alleys of yours. What do you think they're looking? They're cleaning up the trash that tried to fuck with us. We took care of business because this is our home. - Shut up, Bobby. - I'm a reporter... for The Washington Post. I could sure you use the lead on the story. Looking to have a party, Lady? I got some stories for you. Do you do know anything about all the murders... happening in these alleys? You must've seen something. It's kind of strange how they all occurred... in the last several months. They're all connected as my feeling. Come on, I'll show you something that you're going to like. Bobby, what are you doing? I wish you keep your big mouth shut. Good night, sweetheart. Terry. Where are you? Hello? Good evening, Wanda. It's Jason Wynn. Any word from Terry? No, no Nothing. Have you been watching the news? Yes They say that there's another killer out there. Yes, it seems that this city has become an even more... dangerous place to live. By the way, I'm posting someone outside your house... to watch over you. "Thank you, Jason". I'll call to check on you in the morning. Maybe tonight you can finally get some sleep. Good night. That's a hell of a story. But I'm not buying it. Show her, Gareb. Be glad to get this thing out of the alleys. You weren't kidding. Where did you get this? Take it. Maybe without them... there'll be less people getting hurt. This must be the missing weapons that my source was talking about. Are there anymore? There's more hidden around here too. I'll show you. Well... why don't you tell me more about this Al guy. "But it's most important feature, it works, it burns fat". "You trim inches off your waist and those pesky saddlebags... with these pair of legs". "The Flex Flat brought here to help". "And just in weeks, you're going to notice a difference". Wanda. I just want to talk to you, please. I will never hurt you. I only want to protect you. Please! - I need help! - Wanda, it's me. It's me, Wanda. - Listen to my voice. - No. I'm your husband. You're lying to me! You're that monster. Why are you making my mommy cry? Please don't hurt my baby! Please don't hurt my baby! Please... Leave her alone. Don't cry, Mommy. He won't hurt you. That was The Sad Man. What? You know. The Sad Man. He saved me. "The dreams keep coming". "I can't seem to stop them to shut them out". "In the dreams, I see a second real world... where the dead appeared in me". "Now I know that the dead live on". "I'm connected now to this killer, he's just a cypher". "I'm connected to the one who sent the killer". "I have felt a presence of evil and find comfort in its familiarity". "It's been guiding me all along, and will help me change the world". Merrick. "Yes, Jason". Step in here for a moment "I'm on my way". Merrick? Merrick, that you? All right, step out slowly. I've come to take you to hell. Who the fuck are you? You take such pleasure in destroying lives. Hell has been waiting for you. You're the one in my dreams. Can you smell it? The smell of burning flesh. What are your sins, Jason Wynn? Are you ready for Judgement Day? Jason. Something's wrong, I can hear it in your voice. No, nothing. You retreat here, hiding in the shadows of... this alley because you don't want to face the truth. The truth of your existence. You made the deal with Malebolgia. I came back for her. But she sees what a monster I am. I can't let that be the end of us. You'll only bring her more pain. Let her go. I can't. I've to protect her from Jason Wynn. You were brought this evil into her life. The stink of hell you've brought back from your master. - Master? - Who do you think wrapped you... you in that shroud? It was Malebolgia. Are you going to send him the dark soul Jason Wynn... Wynn had me murdered. He'll kill Wanda too if I don't stop him. Your life and Jason Wynn's life have always been entwined. Malebolgia has been guiding both of you. - You are blood brothers. - Who are you? How do you know these things? Because he was once my master too. Listen to me, Hellspawn, I'm your only hope. Maybe you were sent by him to confuse me. I will protect my wife. How are you going to do that? By killing Jason Wynn? That's what your master wants. If you send his soul to Hell, he'll come back... as powerful as you are. I can show you how to break the curse. But you have to stop the savage killing. Wynn is going to die. And to hell with him! "Tomorrow, an exclusive Washington Post's story... will report an allegation of an NSC cover-up regarding... a disappearances of a large supply of new generation of weapons". "The article states that the weapons were stolen several months ago... from NSC's highest security compound". "Sources from inside the NSC alleges that its top officials... may have concealed knowledge of the theft". "The Attorney General's office... He's planning a complete investigation. Do we have our contingency plan, Mr. Wynn? Now that power comes to press, time to collect it at their back. Wynn? Maybe it's time you made me friends. That makes you the man with the master plan. - Merrick! - Those steaming inside you... waiting to get out! Yes, Jason, what's wrong? Did you see that? On the TV. "The NSC has refused to comment". I have a legal right to make a phone call. You haven't charged me with anything, have you? I haven't heard anyone reading my rights. - So I'm not playing your game. - Your prints are all over... that crime scene. Your life is over. Had to cut that short, Burke and Twitch came... into the observation room you know what a tight-assed... Twitch is about procedures. - That guy's cool under pressure. - I still unclear why Chief Banks... didn't allow us to question the suspect. Because I think that guys are Fed. There were two NSC agents hanging by their necks from rafters. - The whole thing stinks. - Excuse me... Detective Burke and Williams. I'm Lisa Wu, Washington Post. You're investigating the murders committed... in the alleys off 42nd. No comment, Lady. I never talked to the press... unless I'm getting the score on a Yankee game. But the coroner says that most of the victims were strangled. Necks, backs broken. But there were three victims who died strictly from gunshot wounds. I'm assuming you have some leads on the possible suspect. Have you found the guns used in the murders? Twitch, do you know? My memories fading, sir. I've been asking around about you guys. Word is that you're both straight arrow cops and I like that. Your job is to find the truth, my job is to report it. I admire your persistence. I've a feeling that there are truths that you know... that may be helpful to us. Tell me about the Fed you're holding... and I'll show you the murder weapons. Step into the my office. That was very nicely done, Miss Wu. I mean Hellspawn, you're fucking things up. You're pissing the man off. The last man I saw him pissed off, he liquidate them. Nothing can be looking like this. I'm a god! Disgusting fucking little paws. - It suits you. - I can forget about getting laid. I've seen the way people look at me. But enough about me. You have to take out our enemies. That would be Jason Wynn. Sooner or later, you're not going to be any worth... to your pretty wife. NSC headquarters. "All visitors must check in and receive clearance for entry". Lisa Wu. I'm here to speak with the director, Jason Wynn. I'm sorry, Miss Wu, as I told you on the phone... we're not making any statements to the press. Well, I'm going to hold a press conference tomorrow... and placed a stolen NSC weapons on a table... in front of the television cameras. The NYPD will be there to confirm that these weapons were used... in some of the recent alley murders. I'm just here to ask Mr. Wynn if he'd like to be there. He's invited. Wanda Blake is still alive. They found your independent contractor... washed up on the shore. Torn apart like the other. Excuse me, waiter. Can I have a bottle? Thanks. His car was still parked in front of her house. Did you invite me to dinner just to fire me, Jason? The killer is still out there, Merrick. You know who it is, don't you? I've been having dreams, they started when the killing began. There's a strange familiarity about it all. It is really fucking with me, Merrick. Playing with my head. Wynn. The Washington Post? What does she want? You are supposed to deal with the press. What the hell do I pay you for anyway? I never wanted anyone giving anything to the press. Understood? A reporter. - Yes. - What's the name? Miss Blake, Lisa Wu. Thanks for seeing me so early in the morning. Please, come in. Hey there. "This is what I know. A man matching your husband's description... is being held at the 87th precinct". They're trying to tie him to the Brooklyn serial murders. I'm really very sorry. "Look, Miss Wu. I checked the police stations..." hospitals, and morgues. "No sign of Terry. How do I know you're not lying?" "Did you actually see Terry?" Miss Blake, I know it's Terry. The only way to get him off the hook... would be to put pressure on the guy who framed him. "And that's Jason Wynn". We're stepping out now. The reporter is in the front. Take the shots when they become available. The reporter first. And then Blake. Stiles. Take your shot. Stiles? "Someone talk to me". "Stiles. Diego. What the hell is going on?" "Are you out there?" "Someone talk to me". I'm coming for you, Jason Wynn. "I'm coming for you, Jason Wynn". That voice. It was in my dream. Two more slaughtered. This is just what I want him to do. He'll come to me and then we'll have him. Level-4 counter-terrorists maneuver? What are we looking for? - No one is talking. - Probably another live exercise. I didn't pick up anything over the wires... - I don't like it. - You don't have to like it... you just have to do what I say. "This could be prom night, Boys". "Preamp spec war strikes, so listen up". "From this moment on, I am the voice of God in your headsets... ...for the outside theme. I want our snipers... on all surrounding buildings, civilians have been evacuated". "Only kill shots". The choppers on the roof waiting. Surveillance equipment is online. Jason, my men want to know what we're dealing with. Let him back us in. And then we'll strike. We can see everything from here. We're ready for him. Command to chopper, anything to report? I don't get it, no briefing, nothing. It's bullshit. I want to get some real action. Got men down here. "What the hell is going on?" "The place is in lockdown who gave that order?" "Shit, stop the door!" - Over here, now! - What the hell is going on? Get these doors open, now! - Great! Hey! - What's going on? Clever. He's taking out our system. He's shutting us down. I need you down there now. All teams check in every two minutes. - Status on power? - They're working on it. Nelson, status from the outside team? Nelson? Jesus. Agent down, need communication with outside team. "We have an intruder". Let's go. "Find a way into this goddamn building now". This one's locked too. Shit, get out of the way! I got it. Hold your fire! Something is in there. All right, let's move out. Come on! We'll gas the fucker out. Shoot when the target's clear. What is the target, Merrick? I haven't seen anything. We're shooting at shadows, what the hell is going on? Just follow my lead. What is it? Get me back up. I need a team up here. Wynn's office, now! There you are, I've been waiting for you. - Who are you? - Don't you remember me? You had me burned alive. What? Simmons? Simmons is dead. No shit. I don't believe you! Do it. Kill me. "If you send in his soul to Hell, he'll come back... as powerful as you are". In there. Fitzgerald and my wife... you'll never endanger their lives again. Get out of here. Get me... Chief Banks. Hey, Dorsey, that guy your holding. We ran his prints, we got a call from the Feds. We're instructed to cut him loose. Cut him loose? What for? That's the guy for sure... and you and I both know that. Order came down from Chief Banks himself. Bring him up. Let him go home. I don't like it either, but that's what we have to do. It's bullshit, can't be true. You heard me. Look, there's nothing we can do about it. Just keep it on the QT, give him the goddamn telephone call. Show your face. Do as I say. Hello, Jason Wynn. I believe it's time I made your acquaintance. Hello. Hi, it's me baby. God, where are you? Are you all right? I'm okay. I'm fine. Can I come home? Come home. Come home.
