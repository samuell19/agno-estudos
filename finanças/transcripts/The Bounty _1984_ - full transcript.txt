This way. The court is assembled by the Right Honorable Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and, I quote, "To enquire into the cause and circumstances "of the seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel, the Bounty, "commanded by Lieutenant William Bligh, "and to try the said Lieutenant William Bligh "for his conduct on that occasion." Surrender your sword and be seated. Lieutenant Bligh, perhaps it would be useful if you told the court, in your own words, the events of April 28th last year. Yes, sir. If it please my lords, I will first read a list of the mutineers who seized my ship. The crew is not on trial here, Mr. Bligh. You, sir, are on trial. The question at issue is how you came to lose your ship. To understand that, Captain Greetham, it is essential to know who the mutineers were. Alleged mutineers. Continue, Mr. Bligh. Fletcher Christian, master's mate. Wasn't this Christian a friend of yours? He was, sir. - 50 guineas says he's dead! - 60 says he's alive! - I wager he's still alive. - How much? - But he'll die within the hour. - How much? 60 guineas. I'll be back to collect. - William. - Fletcher. What are you all doing? One of our members collapsed. We're betting on whether or not he's dead. What brings you to this den of iniquity? Is there somewhere we can talk? - It's a breadfruit. - A breadfruit? The admiralty's instructed me to lead an expedition to take breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica. Tahiti? - I want you to sail with me again. - In what capacity? The admiralty's already assigned a Mr. John Fryer as master of the ship. He's a good man, I think, but I want you to be master's mate. If you agree, that is. Agreed. Good. Splendid. Good. Why take breadfruit to Jamaica? Cheap fodder for the slaves on the plantations there. Bananas are very expensive there these days. It lacks glory, William. I don't have your connections, Fletcher. I want to make a name for myself before I'm too old. And this greengrocery trip will make your name? Now, look. We'll go along Cape Horn to Tahiti. We'll pick up the breadfruit, and then continue through the Endeavour Straits, round the Cape of Good Hope to Jamaica, then back to England. We'll circumnavigate the globe. - Yes, but why risk going round the Horn? - What? Because it is the quicker route, Mr. Fryer. Quicker if we strike the one week in a hundred when there isn't a storm raging. So you would have us go the long way, round Africa and Australia, there and back? Avoid the Horn all together? What conditions do the plants need? Warmth, light and water. I shall be giving up my cabin to them. We shall be like pigs in a sty, shan't we? No, sir, we shall not. I run a healthy ship, Mr. Fryer. I only say the Bounty is too small. We should have a frigate, not a chamber pot. Yes, and I should have promotion to captain. But the navy board would not heed either request. See? - Quickly now, children. - Ah, my little ones! They've come to say good night. Good night. Good night. Off you go. - Say good night to Mr. Christian, Mr. Fryer. - Don't I get a kiss, eh? Harriet. Porkchop. - Good night. - Good night. William, a toast. - To circumnavigation. - To circumnavigation. - To circumnavigation. - To circumnavigation. - And your safe and speedy return. - Yes. We set sail two days before Christmas, 23rd December, 1787. Stand by to set the mainsail! Lively now! What are you starin' at me for? Aloft! Loose that mizzen topsail. Lively! Come on, Purcell! Give us a hand with these gaskets. Pipe down in the rigging! Stand by your clew garnets, sheets and tacks! Away your clew garnets! Set the fore topsail! Set the mainsail! Southwest by south. That's your course. Southwest by south. Aye-aye, sir. Right, men, food's up. Come on. Hey, is it true what they say about Tahiti? You mean the women? Do they go around with no clothes on? All they wear is tattoos in wonderful places. - True? - Cross my heart. Paradise. Hey, you're in my place, Quintal. Move yourself. Don't look at him. There'll be trouble. - I said you're in my seat. - Piss off. - Bugger off. - What did you say? - Shut it, Churchill. - You keep out of this. Look out. He's got a knife. - Keep it quiet, Churchill. - Keep it down, lads. Churchill! Go on, Mills! Get him, Mills! - The king. - The king! God bless him. And to the ship. May she swim well. - The ship! - The ship. The men are very quiet. Charming tune. And a fine musician. We're lucky to have him. Yes. He is not there by chance, Mr. Nelson. Having him there is good for morale. - Dr. Huggan, another glass? - No, thank you, sir. You're uncommonly abstemious tonight. Well, more men have died at sea from drink, disease and dirt than ever died by drowning. Depend upon it. I am determined that the Bounty shall not lose a single man. By heavens, sir, I'll drink to that. Into one soft bush Thinking the sweetest flower to find I pricked my finger - Striking a superior officer! - No, I didn't. - It's a hanging offense, sir. - Sorry, sir. Can't be helped. We shall all get to know each other pretty closely. I wonder what we shall find out. It depends how inquisitive we are, Mr. Young. That doesn't sound quite right to me. Do you think someone had better go and look? There is a ship And it sails the sea It's loaded deep Good evening, Mr. Heywood, sir. Good evening, Adams. Evening, Mr. Heywood, sir. Everything all right here? - Couldn't be better, sir. - Couldn't be better, sir. - My place. - Stupid buggers! You watch your mouth too, old man. Don't "old man" me, Churchill. You haven't got a lucky face. Seasick, Mr. Heywood, sir? Just leaving England. Homesick. It feels you'll never see it again. Don't say that, sir. It's bad luck. Sorry. Never been to sea before. - Two months ago I was still at school. - Never been to school myself. Can't even read. - I can't steer a ship. - Any fool can steer a ship, sir. It's just knowing where to take it. 23rd December, 1787. The end of our first day at sea. - Tot of rum, sir? - No. Thank you, no. - We don't cross the equator every day. - No. Thank you, no. Make sure Mr. Heywood has some, though. Okay, that'll do. Haul him in. Haul away! Coming up, Mr. Heywood, sir! Here you go, sir. Have some of that. Revive the spirit, as they say. Have a suck of that. There you are, Mr. Heywood, sir. Get some of this muck on ya! - Well done, sir. - Thank you, Quintal. Lieutenant Bligh, I have your log here before me. In it, there is the frequent entry of the single word "dancing." Can you explain that? I can, sir. A crew on a long voyage may easily fall info melancholy and violence. I believe this can be relieved by regular exercise. So, for 20 minutes each day, I had the crew mustered, and I had them dance. - Dance? - Yes, they danced. An activity they participated in wholeheartedly? - I think so, yes. - And yet, Mr. Bligh, in your own log you admit that this rather unorthodox form of exercise led to grave discontent. On one occasion only, sir, and not grave. Charlie, if you only had a frock on, I'd ask you for a dance. - Get your knees up, Quintal! - I'm doin' me best, sir. Don't answer back. We're bloody sailors, not bloody dancers! Mr. Christian, Mr. Young, put a gag on Quintal. - It wasn't bloody me! - Don't make it worse, Quintal. It wasn't him, sir. It was me. Come along, Mr. Christian. You've got the wrong man, sir. Churchill said it was he who made the remark. - Gag them both. - Oh, Jesus Christ! Do as he says, Mr. Christian. Sir. Fletcher. Haven't those men been gagged long enough? They were both guilty of insubordination. Fryer could have passed it off with a laugh and have clone less harm. The Royal Navy is not a humorous institution and insubordination is no laughing matter. However, you may cut them loose, Mr. Christian. But mind they appreciate the gravity of their offense. Yes, sir. - Captain's orders. - Ah, yeah. I'm sure. You can close your mouth, or I'll put it back in. I hadn't expected this from the Horn. - Do you think the weather'll stay with us? - Perhaps. It doesn't look much, does it? No, no, it doesn't, sir. But I've seen the Horn when the waves were as high as three houses, one on top of the other. I once saw six men washed overboard on one wave. Someone on this ship is very lucky. Mr. Fryer! Close reef! Close reef, sir? Don't argue with me! Close reef! Close reef, Mr. Cole. Stand by to close reef! All hands on deck! Move yourselves! Hurry along and take those sails in! Cole, get those men aloft! Hurry up! Come on, move yourselves! Get those sails in! He doesn't seem to like fair weather, does he? Haul on that sheet! Get those sails in! Mr. Fryer. I seem to have made a misjudgment. You don't make many, sir. - Make sail. - Sir! - Make sail, Mr. Cole. - Aye-aye, sir. Prepare to make sail! Let go sheets and tacks! Square it away! Get aloft there! Help! Someone! Quickly! - Mr. Christian! - Hold on! Mr. Christian! Pull! Pull! Robert, mind those pots! Robert, mind those bloody pots! - Robert! - Lamb's on fire! Someone douse him! - The man's mad! - We'll all be killed! All hands on deck! Everyone on deck! Close the hatches! Take the wheel, man. Steer to port, Charlie. The wheel, McCoy! - Help! - Hang on, sir. You're all right now. Man those pumps! Jamie, hold that wall! Someone! Who's on the pump? Somebody get a bloody hammer! Sir. Have the carpenter lash those down. We must turn back! In my opinion, we should put about. In my opinion, we should not, sir. We keep on our course. You'll never make it round the Horn. - We must turn back. - Mr. Cole! - Mr. Cole! - I want my opinion in the log, sir. Mr. Cole! Have that lashed down and all the men on deck! - I want my opinion in the log. - Very well, Mr. Fryer, if you wish. - The ship can't stand it. - The ship can stand it very well. How long can the men stand it? As long as the officers can stand it. Get these things tied down now! Valentine! Come with me, boy. Mr. Bligh, how long did you attempt to round the Horn? 31 days. And how far did you travel in that time? 85 miles, sir. 85 miles in 31 days! Mr. Bligh, you endangered your ship and your crew for 31 days in order to satisfy your ambition to circumnavigate the globe? Dearest Betsy, only to you in this bitter moment can I reveal my heart. I have failed completely in my attempt to round Cape Horn and circumnavigate the globe. My doubts about Mr. Fryer's commitment to our endeavor have been confirmed. Enter. - The men are assembled, sir. - Come in, come in. - I'm very sorry, William. - Oh, it can't be helped. Come along. Silence! All right. All right. We will go about and run downwind for Africa and the Indian Ocean. - Mr. Lamb! - Here, sir. As soon as we have put about, it will be safe to light your galley fires again. Tonight I want as much hot mush as we can eat. - Let's hear it for the captain. Hip hip. - Hooray! - Hip hip. - Hooray! However... However, we are still faced with a long, hard voyage. I mean to make good use of every hour of sailing time. And to assist me in this, I am replacing Mr. Fryer with Mr. Christian to act as executive second-in-command with the rank of acting second lieutenant. Mr. Fryer, come back here. Mr. Fryer, sir, come back here! You will dismiss when I have clone with you. Do you hear me? - This is an outrage! - Mr. Fryer... - In all my years at sea... - Your years at sea? Had I known your nature, I would not have taken you as boatswain of a river barge. - Must I suffer this before... - You will suffer it when you're at fault. - What fault? - Damn your eyes, man! - You turned your back on me! - And for that I apologize. - But I protest. - You protest, do you? - I am master of the Bounty. - And I, sir, am commander, by law! I am the first! Do you understand, God damn your hide? And now you may dismiss, sir. - Mr. Cole. - Sir. All hands on deck, if you please. Surely, Mr. Bligh, it was unwise to replace a professional sailor like Mr. Fryer? With a relative novice. Fletcher Christian could hardly be called a novice, sir. The fact that he was a good friend of yours was not an influence upon you? What is the intent of your question, Mr. Greetham? We are trying to establish, Mr. Bligh, how you came to lose your ship. I did not lose my ship, sir. It was taken from me by a gang of mutineers, led by Fletcher Christian. - The man you promoted. - Yes. I promoted him because John Fryer was grossly inefficient and a coward. Fletcher Christian at least had courage. More, perhaps, than you ultimately found to be acceptable, eh, Mr. Bligh? Friday, October 10th. At 12:30 today, James Valentine departed this life as a result of illness and fatigue sustained at Cape Horn. This, after all my care of the men, is surely a result of our drunken surgeon's neglect. "Oh God, by whose mercy the souls of all men rest, "bless these waters and absolve from sin he whose body we now confide to them. "Eternal rest grant unto him, and may he rest in peace. Amen.” Amen. Commit the body to the deep. At 4:00 we buried Valentine with all the decency in our power. 25 degrees, 36 minutes. Land ho! - Land ho! - Where away? Dead ahead, sir! Stand by to fire the salute! Ready to fire salute! Fire! Come here! Stand by for a second salute! Fire second salute! Hey! I'll have her! Here, here. Thank you. Thank you. Dip! Dip! Dip! Dip! Dip! Dip! Dip! Sweet Jesus! - Quintal! - Sorry, sir. Haven't you ever seen a woman before? Keep your mind and your eyes on your work! Come on, get in line there! Dip! Dip! Dip! Dip! Oars! Prepare to toss oars! Toss oars! Boat your oars! Thank you. Maeva, Captain Bligh. Mauriuru, King Tynah. - Enoho. - Thank you, Your Majesty. I bring you greetings from His Majesty King George of England. How is the great Captain Cookie? Captain Cook? He's well, and he also sends his greetings. - He lives? - Yes. - He is my friend. - I know. Now you see. - He gave me his picture. - Yes. Some people say he was killed by the people of Hawaii. No... Captain Cook is very much alive and he's in good health, King Tynah. He's very much alive. As I said, he sends his greetings to you and he's always talked of you as his very close friend. You told that to this man Tynah? King Tynah, sir. A savage king? A king, my lord, descended from many kings. As our King George is descended from many kings? - Yes, in a way, sir. - Then why did you lie to him? Why did you not tell him Captain Cook was murdered in Hawaii 10 years before? Because they believe that Captain Cook is immortal. - Literally? - Yes, I think so, sir. They seem to regard his likeness as a sacred image. Interesting. They also believe that every British officer is more or less related to him. So you were more or less immortal, too? It would appear so, sir, and I also needed their assistance. Captain Cook was our guarantor. How long you stay in Tahiti? About two months, around the islands. Stay here. Do not go to the other islands. No welcome there for you. Everything you need is here. I'm much obliged to you. His Majesty King George has sent you many gifts, King Tynah. Perhaps I could carry back in return gifts from yourself to His Majesty King George. Anything for a king. Pigs, bananas, coconuts, breadfruit... Breadfruit! Breadfruit is a very good idea. Yes, breadfruit. I think His Majesty likes breadfruit. Isn't that true, Mr. Nelson? Indeed it is, sir. His Majesty is a very keen gardener. He would appreciate breadfruit greatly. If you sent him little breadfruit plants, he could grow them in his own garden. We shall grow him many little plants. Thank you. Mr. Christian, Mr. Cole. Would you distribute the gifts to King Tynah and his good people? These are gifts from His Majesty King George of England to yourselves. Oh, dear God! - I hoped to avoid this. - Avoid what, sir? Damn it all, man. I'm expected to sleep with her. She's one of King Tynah's wives, a gift from one chief to another, as it were. Now, look. Five minutes after I go below, call me up on important business. - Yes, sir. What business? - Business, damn it! Any bloody business. Welcome aboard, ma'am. This way. Yes. - Get on with your work. - Yes, sir. She should soften the old man up a bit. Hot. Pretty. That wouldn't feed a dog for two nights, never mind me! Emma - Excuse me, sir, I... - Mr. Christian! - Sir? - What demands my immediate attention? - It could wait until tomorrow. - What is it, damn you? - The ship is sinking, sir. - Good. Ma'am. Was Fletcher Christian at this time still your friend and ally? At that time, yes. There was no indication of any resentment towards you? No, none. Mr. Bligh, when you planted out your breadfruit, did not the savages carry out some sort of ceremony? An indecent ceremony? Is this relevant, Captain Greetham? Milord, if the crew were allowed to witness it, yes. Were the crew present, Mr. Bligh? - Yes. - And was it indecent? It is their deep belief that the earth is rendered fruitful by the coupling of their gods and that the gods can be roused by the coupling of men and women. So it did begin at the ceremony? No, sir, not at the ceremony. No, it was Fletcher Christian and the native girl. You misunderstood the depth of the emotion between them? Yes, I realize that now. I had assumed that it was simply youthful passion. It takes more than an infatuated youth to make a mutiny. - It takes a discontented crew. - They were anything but discontented. Fletcher Christian corrupted them. But what made them so easy to corrupt? I don't know. It was the place itself. If I did sail beyond the sea I'd take my pretty girl with me And she would cook and care for me And I'd be the pride of the king's navy But, alas, it is the law I had to leave her on the shore - Mr. Christian? - Come in, whoever you are. Captain Bligh is surprised he hasn't had your company at supper for some weeks. Do you still do that? He says he'll expect you this evening. But today, today's not Friday. 6:00. Prompt, if you please. Wait, Dr. Huggan. I found the most extraordinary plant today. On the west side of the island, just by the mouth of the river. Mr. Christian, it is 7:30. Well, you didn't wait for me, I hope. May I ask why you have come to my table in a state of undress? Well, I couldn't wear the jacket. The tattoo is too painful. - Good God. - Put on your jacket, Mr. Christian. It's very painful, sir. Put on your jacket, Mr. Christian, if you please. - May I serve now, sir? - Wait. Thank you, Mr. Christian. - Very well, Smith. You may serve now. - Thank you, sir. No. - Oh, Mr. Nelson. - Yes, sir? When did you last inspect the breadfruit plants? - Yesterday, sir. - Not today? No, sir. Mr. Christian said a daily inspection was not necessary. Oh, did he indeed? Well, Mr. Christian, and when do you think they will be ready to transport, in your opinion? They'll be some time yet, sir. We've already been here 13 weeks too long. Will we never leave this place? Because we arrived so late, the plants... I want to be advised of their progress every day, Mr. Christian, unless you need the time to cover the rest of your body in pretty pictures. Wait! The sooner we are seamen again, the better. Don't you agree, gentlemen? Now perhaps you will join me in prayer. O Lord our Heavenly Father, Almighty and Everlasting God, most humbly do we thank thee for what we are about to receive. Won't be long now, lads. You'll all be on your way home. You're not coming? I fancy having a look at a few of the other islands around here. They'll hang you for desertion. Only if we're caught. You with us, John? No. I've got a wife, three kids back home. There he goes, Mr. Bligh-and-bloody-mighty. How do you fancy the Endeavour Straits, the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic, the North Atlantic, nothing but rotten biscuits and pork? And his bloody Lordship on your back, morning, noon and night? Not me, lads. Not me. When do we go, then? Who's officer of the watch tonight? I am. Yeah? Yes. Well, that's it, then. E', Fletcher Christian. Hyre mi. - Marehi. - Thank you. You wanted to see me, sir? My daughter, she has something of yours. Of mine? You are here. Now, Tamarihi. - Well, I'm sorry, sir. I... - Genia. Take this tusk. And when you see it, you will remember my daughter and my grandchild. You will never forget Tahiti Nui. Fletcher Christian, your wife. - Do you think we should go as well? - No, I do not. Mr. Heywood's gonna have to answer for this. Poor Heywood. Hey Bloody fools. The Hottentots out there aren't as friendly as these ones. Yeagh! Come on, lads. Good luck to 'em, that's what I say. They'll need it. All hands! Thank you, Mr. Fryer. Last night, three men of Mr. Heywood's watch deserted ship, the penalty for which is death by hanging. Mr. Heywood, how is it you did not see them? - Were you asleep? - Yes, sir. Very well. You shall kiss the gunner's daughter. - Boatswain! - Sir? Put this man over the cannon. Do it now! Aye-aye, sir. Now listen to me, all of you. - In one week's time... - Anything wrong? Stop that laughing! Silence! Do you think this is funny? You're a pitiful sight, Dr. Huggan. Go below to your quarters. Do you think this is a humorous occasion? You are mistaken. From now on, there is going to be discipline on this ship. We're going to have order and we're going to be like seamen. In one week's time, we will put to sea. There will be no more grog. There will be no more shore leave. You have become a rabble, all of you. And you will clean up! This ship and yourselves! - Boatswain! - Sir. Administer the punishment now. Captain Bligh. Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian, sir! - Sir? - I wish to talk to you outside. - Now. - Coming, sir. Thank you. - Is there anything wrong, sir? - Last night, while the watch was asleep... Stop that noise! Three men jumped ship last night. Churchill was one of them. You don't seem surprised. Now that it's happened, no, I'm not surprised. I'm no longer surprised myself when I see the example being set by my first officer. Just look at the way you're dressed. Come on! You're no better than one of these natives. At least I am no worse. Your brain has been overheated, and your body overindulged in sexual excess. I have clone no more than any natural man would do. No! You've clone no more than any wild animal would do. When men lose their self-restraint, they say it's natural. They are more natural than men who have nothing to restrain. Mr. Christian, report to the ship before sundown. Is that understood? - No, no. - What did you say? You said no, is that what you said? Is that what you said? No? All right. You will report to the ship immediately. Understand? And you will stay there. There will be no more mixing with degenerate natives by any of my officers or by any of my crew! Do you comprehend me, sir? Good! Keep 'em coming. Don't drop 'em. Come on, Purcell. Remember that's what we're here for. And the next one, please. Come on, keep 'em coming! Good lads. - All right. Where are they? - I don't know yet, sir. We'll find them. Damn fools. Don't make it worse for yourself. Stand up. Stand up! He can't, sir. Bit of trouble with the locals out there. Do you know the penalty for desertion, mister? We came back of our own accord, sir. You're a mindless animal, Churchill. I will decide your punishment when you're fit to receive it. Mr. Cole, get Dr. Huggan. Aye-aye, sir. Sir, over here. - Is he dead? - Yes, sir. Poor bugger. All right, bury him. Will you organize that, please, Mr. Cole? Fletcher! I've come to say goodbye. You do not come back, do you? Ever. - I must go now. - No. Not yet. Soon. Eyes front, Mr. Christian! Off hats! Take the men below. Make sail, Mr. Fryer. Aye-aye, sir. Stand aside. Stand down. Stand down! Come on, lads. No sense in this. Well, gentlemen. Between ourselves and home are 27,000 sea miles, the Endeavour Straits and the Great Barrier Reef. Now, the crew is deeply demoralized, gentlemen, and I must accept, as every captain must accept, the inevitable and theoretical responsibility for that. The actual and immediate responsibility, however, I place on you, my fellow officers, who met this crisis with lethargy, impotence and flagrant defiance, publicly uttered. And... And perhaps also for that, I am to blame, as I counted on a strength of character which you do not possess. However, however, the cure for our predicament is discipline. And I shall apply it, with an even hand, of course, but most where it is most required. Yes, well, that will be all, thank you. You may leave now. Not you, Mr. Christian. Leave it. Now. All right, Smith, you may go. And close the door, please. So... You think I'm harsh with you, eh? Look, I've been at sea many years, Fletcher, since I was 12. And I've seen many men, many good men, lose their heads over native women in these waters. I've never yet seen it come out well. Of course I understand the excitement and... But think to yourself, man. Could you take a woman like that back home to your friends and family? No, of course you couldn't. They're not like us, Fletcher. You think I was harsh with you, but you needed someone to show you where your duty really lay. Because you were at a loss, my friend. You may not thank me now, but you will later. So, let's get the ship running properly and get back to where we were before. Now, look, Fletcher... Look, listen to me. I am prepared to forgive and I am prepared to forget. Do you understand me? Will that be all, sir? - Yes, that will be all. - Thank you. You sent for me, sir. Yes, I did. This ship is filthy, Mr. Christian. Sir? The ship is filthy, Mr. Christian! Look for yourself! Look. Filthy, sir. Filth there. And there. And there. Look at that. I understand you dismissed the swabbing party. You've left these decks crusted with grime. Look at it there! Bloody disgrace! Now you'd be well advised, sir, to call them back again. And this time, do it properly. Do you understand me? Filth, sir! Filthy, Mr. Christian! Still filthy! - Look! - I see nothing, sir, but your finger. I'll not have your vile ways brought aboard my ship! Do you understand? You'll call up the swabbing party yet again! This time you'll make bloody sure the decks are clean! Or by God you will answer for it! I'll not have any foul, filthy getaways on my ship! Do you understand? Good God! Pigs in a sty have more comprehension of cleanliness than you buggers have! You'll get these decks clean, or I'll make you lick them clean with your tongues if you don't mend your ways! There is a thief among us. Yes, there is a thief on board the ship, which is unfortunate, because you know what hardship that means for honest men. Last night my personal store of coconuts was well up to the top of the netting. This morning, well, look for yourself. See? If the thief declares himself, I will punish him alone. Then we can forget the matter. - Sir... - Hold your tongue, God damn you, sir! I am addressing the crew, Mr. Christian. Who do you think you are? - If the thief will not declare himself... - I took one. You? I was thirsty. I took one of your coconuts. I thought it of no consequence. One coconut, Mr. Christian? A dozen were taken, man! I know nothing of a dozen. Unless you're a liar and a thief, the rest were taken by others on your watch, who look to you for their example. - Mr. Cole! - Sir? Impound the personal stores of every man on Mr. Christian's watch - and put them on half rations. - Aye-aye, sir. Thank you. Stand down! That isn't a raft. It's a coffin. There's a five-knot current running between here and that island. I'll take my chance. You think a lot of us haven't thought of it? You're not the only one to have left a woman behind. Fletcher, the men are ready for anything. What are you saying, Ned? Are you inciting me to mutiny? If I were you, I'd take the ship. That's all. Why don't you, then? I said, "If I were you." I'm not. What I have to say to you is the result of considerable reflection. Its consequences will be twofold. Firstly, our journey will be shortened, which I know is a consideration that cannot distress you. And secondly, upon its successful conclusion, not one of you in later years will look back without a surge of pride. We shall go with the winds to Jamaica by way of Cape Horn. You'll kill us all. What did you say, Adams? We tried the Horn before. It was almost the end of us. Damn you, man. Don't you bloody cross me. Mr. Cole, take this man below, and tomorrow we will assemble to watch him receive punishment for cowardice and insubordination. Mr. Cole, take him below, sir! - And Mr. Fryer, give him the makings. - Sir. Now, we set out to circumnavigate the globe and by God we shall do it, to the greater glory of us all. Is that understood? Thank you. Now you may dismiss. Enter. - Can I have a word with you? - I'm busy. Is it important? I think, yes. Be brief. William, your decision to go round the Horn... "William"? Not "sir"? Not "Captain"? "William"? - I don't think the men will have it. - Oh, the men won't have it? Are they in charge of the Bounty? - They might be, if you insist. - Repeat that, please. The men "might be" in charge? What are you threatening me with? It's not a threat. It's a warning. There are rumblings, are there? No. There is fear. Around the Horn is the easiest way, the better way, and that is how we will go. Anything more? - Don't put Adams to the lash. - He was insubordinate. Cowardly and insubordinate. He frightened the men. I did not put that fear there. He did. So he will be lashed, and we will go round the Horn. Are you frightened to go round the Horn, Mr. Christian? Are you a coward too, sir? There'll be no killing. - Except Bligh. - There will be no killing! We set him adrift. Christian's taking the ship. Are you with us? We're taking the ship. Come on, get up. Wake up. Shut up! Christian's taking the ship. Christian's taking the ship. We're taking the ship. Are you with us? Come on, Fryer, wake up! - Hello, Fryer! - Get up! Mr. Bligh, will you get up? Get up! Get up! On your feet. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Tie him. What are you doing? Christian? - Mr. Cole! - Shut up, Bligh. - You lily-livered bastard! - Come on, get up on deck! Mr. Cole! You'll hang for this, Ellison! Mr. Nelson? We've taken the ship. We've taken the ship! We've taken the ship. We got Bligh. Get on deck! Dance! Dance! - Easy! - Dance! Dance! - Quintal... - You sod off! Dance! Move! Come on, move! Get going! You're a fool, Quintal. You'll hang for this. - Are you in this, Norton? - No, sir, I'm not. - Shut up! - Put aside this madness. You'll hang! Why are you doing this? Do you have any conception of what you're doing? Shut your mouth! - I know you're in this, Adams. - It's all your fault. There was never a coward on this ship, and that was your mistake! You're a black-hearted villain, sir! Purcell, get over here! - Stay there, Purcell! - Stay, Purcell! - Stay! - Go on, get over then. - Ellison, get over here! - Stay! Shut up! I'm stayin' here! Let's kill the bugger now, lads! I said leave him, you sodding bastards! - Take your hands off him! - Let's kill him. - Take your hands off him now! - Kill him! Get your hands off him! Now! Mr. Christian, I appeal to you, sir. Put aside this madness. - Too late. It's too late. - Think of my family and my friendship. I am in hell! Hell, sir! Why are you being so damned reasonable now? God damn your blood to hell with mine, sir! - God damn your blood! - Get a hold of yourself. - You be quiet or I will run you through! - Do it, Christian! Kill him! Just shut your mouth! You shut your mouth! I will run you through, and then I will Kill myself after. You get him dressed now. Get him dressed! - What's the matter with you all? - Bastard! - You be quiet! - Knock them down, damn you! - They're common criminals! - You will be silent, sir! Get out of it, Cole! Just stay there! You will be silent, or I will have you killed, you bastard! You blow my guts out, Mr. Christian! You run me through and you'll have my blood on your hands! Quiet! We will get him in the boat. Set him adrift. Get him dressed! Will someone give me my breeches? Pass us your watch up here, then. Come on, move yourself! - You blackguard! Traitors! - You what? Mr. Bligh, come here, please. If you wish to leave some of these men on the ship, I give you my word they will not be harmed. Lads, one of you will have to come out. There's no room. - Mr. Fryer, you come up here. - We'll do without him! - Mr. Fryer, get up here! - Stay there, or I'll blow your head off! God damn you! You're the scum of the earth! Coleman, get up here. Now! - Come on, Coleman, move yourself. - Faster, man! It will be fairly reported that you were not part of this rabble. Thank you. Smith, bring that chest to me. Do it now. Get in the boat. What use is that without charts? I need the charts. Turn around. You really think you can command this rabble? - I'll do my best. - Well, I did my best. And I had the authority of the law. - You're a dead man, Fletcher. - That's enough of that. Get on the boat, sir. - Quickly. - You've not seen the last of me. Take my word for it. Thank you, Mr. Lamb. Nor you, Adams. You've not seen the last of me. I wouldn't wager on it. We shall see, sir. I'll see you hanged! Veer them away! - Bring anything, Smith? Shut up. - A carving knife. Veer them away! Sight your oars, my lads. Come on, sight your oars, my brave boys. Get the oars out. William! Isn't this what you came for? Here you go! A present from us to King George! Goodbye, boys! Hope you never come back! If you get home, tell my mother that I love her. And she's got a lovely little Tahitian grandson! Go on! Bye-bye! Have a nice trip! I hope they bloody eat you, Fryer! Yeah, you can roast Norton! Dip! Dip! I hope never to see Fletcher Christian again, unless it is to see him hanged. How could he have betrayed my friendship and kindness to him? I can only assume he has decided to return to a life in Tahiti. After taking stock of the meager provisions allowed us, I have decided to make for the island of Tofua in the hope of supplementing our supplies of food and water. By now there are many natives about us, and by their manner we do not expect our welcome to last much longer. - Mr. Cole. - Sir? Now, you take charge of my log, and slowly make your way out to the launch. - Easy, Mr. Cole. - Aye-aye, sir. - Go now? - Go now. That's right. Now don't you give me no trouble, my boys. You ugly bugger. - Come on, men! - Get in the boat! Leave that barrel! Come on, move, man! This what you want? There you are! Everybody in the boat! Prepare to pull away! - Mr. Bligh! - Get on the boat! - Where's the captain? Where's Mr. Bligh? - Over there. - Let go of me! - Come on! Norton, come back, you fool! What are you doing, man? Come back! Get in the boat, sir! Get off me! Captain Bligh! Sir! Mr. Bligh! Get back, you bastard! Keep back, you bastard! - They'll have your eyes... - Get back in the boat! - Help him in! - Come on, sir. Mother of God! Row for your lives! Take your clothes off. Throw them your clothes. - Throw those clothes over! - Bloody savages! Row for your lives! We're chops and livers to them if they catch us. That's the spirit. Come on! We'll do it! We cannot risk going ashore again. What are we going to do, sir? Well, we shall have to try and reach Coupang. Without charts? Well, I shall have to navigate from memory, Mr. Fryer. It'll take us close to the most savage islands in these waters, the Fiji islands, where cannibalism is perfected almost to a science. From there, God willing, we shall proceed onward to the Great Barrier Reef, then to the coast of New Holland and across the Timor Sea to Coupang. It will take us at least two months and we have provisions and water enough to last one week. So that is the situation, gentlemen, plain and simple. Well, we'll just have to make the best of it, won't we, sir? Make the best of it, Smith? Yes. But will you? That's what I ask myself. Do you hear me? Are you prepared to make the best of it, all of you? Because all I can promise you lads is relentless pain and hardship. Now, if you're prepared to make do, to make sacrifices, and furthermore are willing to swear by it, I promise you our chances of survival are fair. Do you hear me? Do you all say "aye"? - Aye. - Good! Mr. Fryer, make way. Prepare to make way. Make way. The water is wide and I cannot get o'er Nor yet have I The wings to fly Give me a boat That will carry two And so shall roam My love and I There is a ship Fletcher! Fletcher! In the box are gifts for the people of Tahiti Nui. We did not expect you back. We have already given you everything. We only want our women, and perhaps some men to help me sail the ship. Where's Captain Bligh? Why doesn't he come himself? He's no longer with us. I've taken the ship. - 'Ua Mate? - No, no, he's not dead. We set him adrift with some of the crew. You shame me by coming here. You shame me! King George will send ships with guns to punish us for what you have clone. We can give you nothing. Go now. Some of the men would like to remain here and wait for the next ship. They wanted to go with Bligh, but there was no room in his boat. They can stay, but not you. Take your gifts and go. No! Should she not be allowed to choose for herself, sir? Where will you take her? I don't know. Somewhere the British ships won't find us. Take her. You will have all the men you need. Go now. - Goodbye, Peter. - Good luck, sir. - I think you'll need it more than I. - Thank you. I'm not coming, Fletcher. I've thought it out and... Well, I'm staying here. - Let's go. - I think I'll stay too, sir. Get out. - Let's go! - Come on, lads! They'll hang you. I might just have a lucky face. There they are. Here they come. There! Got one! There's loads of them! They're all over the place! There's hundreds of them! Here it comes. There they go! - Sod it! Who loaded these things? - Give us one more... Any more muskets? Quint, hurry up! Come on, man. Quick, quick, quick! Yes! The only one I wholly trust is Adams. I go everywhere with a loaded pistol, and where we are to head beyond the reach of justice, I know not. Thursday, June 11th. In the afternoon, we saw gannets and many other birds, and at sunset we caught one in our sail, which I reserved for our dinner next day. Who shall have this? Smith. And who shall have this? Mr. Fryer. What about the rest of us? You'll just have to wait your turn, Purcell, like everyone else. Some of us haven't had nothin' in days! That's enough, Purcell. Well, it's not enough for me, sir! I'll tell you somethin'. - The officers and their lot get everything. - Shut your mouth, Purcell. - I'm as much a man as you are, sir! - What did you say? I said I'm as much a man as you are. Are you? I'm not so certain about that. Put it down, damn you! I'll knock you on the head with it! Sit down! Sit down! Mr. Cole, give this man my share of food. I am committed to a desperate enterprise. I have said farewell to everything I used to regard as indispensable, but I suppose I have found freedom. So you've found freedom, have you? Freedom? Retribution is what you want. Isn't that why you gave him your compass? - I wanted to give him a chance. - So he'll come after us again. How can he come after us? He'll be marooned on some island. I only wish to God I'd given him muskets. Now get out! At least 10 times we have touched land, only to find either barren rocks or hostile inhabitants, and once nearly ran afoul of an English frigate. Our stores are low, the spirits of the men even lower. His royal highness woken up at last? Given you a rest, has he, darling? Fletcher wants you. Ned, I've found it. Listen. "July 2nd. We discovered an island, seeming uninhabited.” "It was well timbered, but we could find no anchorage." That's perfect. Every ship in the Royal Navy has that book and those charts. They never drew it on the charts. All they give is a latitude, 25 degrees south. It seems to me all we have to do is simply sail along this line of latitude till we find it. And if we don't? These men need a home, Fletcher. They've mutinied once. Oh, they'll have a home. Pitcairn's Island. They'd better. I can no longer write for lack of strength. Commend me to your parents and our loving daughters. Mr. Bligh. When my spirit is gone, there will be nothing but flesh remaining. I beg you, use that poor flesh to save the others. No, no, Mr. Nelson. We're civilized men, not savages. And civilized men we shall die. Have no fear. Sir, we'd like a word. We've had it up to here. There is no island. We want to turn back to Tahiti. And who'll navigate? Well, you. You're the navigator. I'll navigate. This ship's going to Pitcairn's Island. Sir! Sir! - Smith. - It's land! - What? - I think it's land! Mr. Cole, you'll hoist the Jack. Sir? It's not proper to land without identification. Oh, God! Sir. I am Lieutenant William Bligh. I'm a British naval officer, and I have to report an act of piracy. We've found it. We've found it, Ned! It's our island. We could easily have missed it. Yes. We'll never get off this island now, will we, sir? Never see England again. This court finds that the seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel Bounty was an act of mutiny by Fletcher Christian and others of her crew and that her captain, Lieutenant William Bligh, is, in the opinion of this court, to be exonerated of all blame on this occasion. Indeed, in the matter of his command of the Bounty's open launch, we commend Lieutenant Bligh for his courage and exemplary seamanship. Will you please come forward, Lieutenant? Milord. Thank you.
