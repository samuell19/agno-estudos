Even such tiny fish can have such great courage As people, how can we have less courage than the fish? Oh dear, isn't it special? It's someone's birthday and she's neither whining nor watching cartoons Mom, let me tell you I think my birthday is really important That's because you have a watch coming No, that's not why It's because it's the day a great man passed away What?

President Chiang Kai-Shek... ...passed away last night Our entire nation has sunken into deep sorrow What a beautiful moment, so touching Give it to me Cut it out already Don't act like I don't remember a thing There wasn't a soul on the streets that day... ...just the downpour and the wind However, I always believed that... ...our baby came to this world... ...on such a stormy day... ...it means she'll go places one day Not sure it makes sense, but I'll buy it Chi, you were born on a big day! You are going to be great one day! Yes! I should learn from Chiang Kai-Shek Be a great person one day Yeah, make us proud Hey, but he died on that day Maybe it's not a lucky day Shut up!

Chi, I'm going to tell you something Recently, I have problem seeing colors... Everything I see is in black and white What? Why? Because I read a certain book with my classmates One day, the police came We were "invited" to the police station for some tea... Wen, are you a prince? A prince? If only I were that charming You have a great sense of imagination Imagination gives us the ability to create beautiful things But oftentimes... ...the truth is not what you imagined I hope when you grow up... ...you will set off to find truths and answers on your own To find truths and answers on my own? How? Just remember... ...what people tell you isn't always true Try to see the world through your own eyes with wisdom Eyes? Wisdom? Yes. Even if your eyes can no longer see properly like mine But inside your heart, there is another pair of eyes A pair of eyes that see what others can't That's wisdom The prince who lived in the No-Book-Reading Kingdom... ...read the books that were prohibited to read So he was forced to drink poisonous tea His eyes would never again see color... What? Why is that? But, if he could find his beloved princess His eyesight would be restored This is the end of my story Thank you very much Chi, where did your story come from? It's something that happened to my elder cousin I turned it into a story Don't tell the story again to anyone - ls that clear? - Why? Don't ask why. It's for your own good Later, after a long time Wen sent a postcard and a photo Dear Chi, how are you? America is a free country I am excited to breathe in the air of freedom Gradually, I can see the glittering colors of a Christmas tree And, I've found the princess of my dreams Wow, that's awesome I want to find my prince, too Hello?

I'm kidding I wish I could say I was surprised by your reaction Okay, let's talk about this some other day I'm really busy right now, ok? Can we really see things with our hearts? But the eyes in my heart seem to be clouded Growing up means more things... ...become impossible to understand Granny, what should I do?

It's alright Granny lived a long full life, we should be happy for her Don't be sad Chi dear Maybe you should think about having a kid? Having a baby would change you completely A baby can bring you and your husband happiness... ...and help bring you closer Mom, I'm too busy with work Oh, just quit your job... ...and focus on having a baby Your husband makes enough money anyways The only thing that kept me and your dad together... ...was having you Stop pushing me I don't want to become like you I...

Granny Please pray to our ancestors to help me I see that you don't like physics, chemistry and math? No, not really Then why study these subjects? Mom and Dad want me to become a doctor What do you want to become? Well... Alright. I've got an idea Well? Do you feel the power of your ancestors? I don't think so The power is definitely with you When you go back, you will feel it Alright Wow! High scores Granny, our ancestral spirits gave me great help this time Could you get them to keep on helping me? Well, actually... ...it's not our ancestral spirits that helped you do well It's more like... ...what you believe in determines who you are What made a difference was how much you wanted it That's how it works, Kiddo "President Chiang Ching-kuo's funeral" "English Vocabulary Book" Right after I started middle school Both the outside world and my physical body... ...started to change a lot But there was only thing I care about... Go! Chi. You can do it Ladies and gentlemen... Chi is attending the best senior high school in town Then she'll be attending medical school We are so poor... ...that we have nothing but money "Chi's Hospital" Thanks for all your compliment It's worth every bit of your hard work Chi will make it to medical school for sure It's too early to say Mom - I'm really sorry - Mom It's alright. Really You're just too tired All I took was some scallion... ...I had no idea about the consequence I thought that nobody wanted it Mom, don't worry about it I'm here for you You can always count on me, okay? You have your own life in the U.S... I was afraid to burden you... I'm sorry Mom, take some rest Everything will be alright Let me cook you something to eat Would you like that? Ugh! What a smell Since when did mom start to live like this? And how come I never found out until now? Granny, did I do this to my mom? Did I choose the wrong path? Kiddo, are you feeling regret? You want to be 17 again? I'm not sure There's no way back After the martial law got lifted... ...the air in Taiwan seemed freer There were protests outside the Presidential Palace all the time It's blocked again Your ID Wait for us, Chi What are you doing? At that time... I really thought... ...my future was full of hope I hardly ever come to Taipei... ...Let's go ice skating ...that recognize facts and truths All they've done was reading a book... ...the police broke into their houses Not only they are going to jail... They might even be sentenced to death ls this really happening after the martial law was lifted? No Give us back our free minds Allow us to read history and facts Release the innocent Abolish the Betrayers Punishment Act Fight political persecution The government has arrested pro-independence youths This is a form of hypocrisy The five of them could never have formed an armed rebellion This is a scheme set up by the intelligence units The military, police, and spies should leave the campuses Enable freedom of thought... ...academic freedom and freedom of speech Attention You have already violated the Assembly and Parade Act You will be forcefully removed Enable freedom of speech Please disperse immediately Release the innocent Bloody cop, back off Thank you All of a sudden... ...I heard a voice speaking to me Lin Shu-Chi Don't waste time on physics and chemistry that you don't like at all The daughter of that independent legislator got into our school What's she like? Let's go have a look Ok, let's go What do you like to read? What do you like to do? Are you going to law school? Hold on, one at a time, please Are you going to be a lawyer like your father? I don't want to be like my father I want to be a doctor What is your main hobby? Yeah, what's your hobby? Hmmm, I like to watch Andy Lau's Hong Kong dramas Huh. There's nothing extraordinary I thought she'd be into some really deep books Wait Hey, excuse us Your father is a celebrity That's why everyone's curious about you Please don't take it personally Why should I follow in my father's footsteps? I wish I weren't related to Chen Shui-bian at all I hate being treated like an animal in the zoo The times had changed... ...but the paths planned out for us hadn't change Seeing her plight... ...I decided to choose a path for myself You are overreacting I wanted to change my major, that's all What is this gathering all about? Give her some advice, won't you? Isn't it better to study sciences and become a doctor? That's right. If you're a doctor, you can save people You should listen to your parents How about being a lawyer or an accountant? - Easy to make money - No I want to study literature or philosophy... ...or even history Can any of those put food on the table? You can become a teacher, a guaranteed job I'll be fine. I can manage I want to fight for a better society Huh? What is she talking about now? Don't force me. This is my life Yes, she's right... It's her life That's right Years ago when you left our hometown to come to Taipei I didn't stop you, did I? Going to college has been great already She'll at least have a decent office job That's right Didn't you always say? "Listen to your parents" Now, listen to your parents As long as there is food on the table Let's eat Bon appetit What's wrong, dad? My flat with elevator and airconditioning... all gone All going up in smoke Granny, can you believe this? I turned out to be a housewife... Isn't it ironic? Taste good You're doing well if you can cook like this It's a feat being able to feed yourself Chi. Your dad has finally hit the jackpot Enough! Bullshit luck I won. Look Have a look Not now Luck has been on my side... Dad, not now. Mom is upset The rabbit year is coming I'll have a golden rabbit made... ...for my grandkid in the U.S. Golden rabbits don't cost any money? You don't even have any money You spent it all on buying lottery Okay... stop it... Okay, stop fighting, come eat dinner Listen, try my cooking You always wish me bad luck Stop fighting Stop it. I'm quite a cook Forget about dinner Mom, stop saying that Stop fighting Can we please eat now? Crap. Especially this stupid picture Stop it! That's my idol I'm going to throw it away Give it to me I need pocket money to eat If I starve to death, you'll be a widow Sooner or later, I'll be mad or dead - What's wrong with Chi? - Something wrong? It did not take long for my parents to remind me... ...why I always wanted to leave in the first place Seeing your parents bicker can be a simple happiness I've never seen that all my life I've thought about... ...coming back to Taiwan to raise a child on my own But it doesn't feel like working I'm too naive, aren't I? Wait You're pregnant? Yes My parents don't know yet I don't know how to tell them I'm very worried What are you worried about? Having a child is a great thing It's a gift from heaven So happy for you, Chi Actually, I... Oh dear, you got into a fight again? They started it They kept saying Rusimi's mom ran away to Indonesia and abandoned him... ...and they told him to scram to Indonesia So I told them off But there's no reason to hit someone That's because they called me an American... ...and told me to scram to America Mommy, but I'm Taiwanese Well, I see that they've said mean things... ...but still you shouldn't have hit people It hurts mommy to see you bruised, you know? But Mommy, I won the fight How many were you fighting against? Three Oh no... I have to apologize to three families this time? They should apologize to us OK, let me see Can I really come back to this? Back then, I was so eager to leave Happiness Road And now, I hesitate to come back Hurry up, Chi Come on, quickly Hurry up Before anyone notices Lin Shu-Chi Mom? What're you doing here? I came to warn you Don't go to those radical demonstrations What are you talking about? We worked so hard to send you to school... ...It's for you to have good education... ...and find a good job, not to become a rebel on the streets I saw it on TV Oh, you saw me? - You little brat - It's not what you think We're demanding labor rights... ...so workers like you can have better welfare benefits What benefits? You get locked up for doing things like that You're exaggerating I forbid you to take part in those activities Fine. Please go home You'll miss the bus to Happiness Road But of course, I wouldn't listen to my mom After admitted to college ...I finally moved out from Happiness Road "Mayor elected: Chen Shui-bian" Thank you As it were, I went on to graduate from college Due to my low attendance... ...my grades were horrible While all my classmates went study abroad... ...I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life... ...or what I could do You really have no idea what you want to do with your life? Do you? My goodness What happened to you? Dad, are you alright? What happened? I fell in the factory The doctor said I'll be fine It's not bad I can take a break for a while You out of your mind? What're we going to eat if you don't work? No worries, the insurance will compensate You... Chi, you've graduated for some time now When are you going to get a job? Don't be as lazy as your father It's only been a few months I've been looking for jobs Looking What are you looking for? Look at your father. He is injured I'm begging you, go get a job soon Don't put your parents in this position... We told you to study sciences, didn't we? It's not easy to get a job with your major...

What's the big deal? I get my pension anyway Please, how much do you get a month? After started working... ...I began to understand Mom's obsession with money Every month I looked forward to the pay day Chi You haven't paid this month's rent and utilities Mom, all you want is money Didn't I already give you some? Not enough Now your dad is out of job You have to help support the family Dad has a retirement pension... ...which you took from him The money in it isn't even close to being enough Worked for 25 years, got less than one million NTD That money won't last forever Mom Here Just like that, I turned into a busy adult... ...working hard to crank out money to please my parents What a day Hey kid, I need to get my scooter repaired Dad, there's a customer Lin Shu-Chi Hsu Sheng-En Long time no see That's your son? - This is your shop? - Yep You?
