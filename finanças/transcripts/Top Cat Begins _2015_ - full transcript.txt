The Starlight Nightclub! You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. My kind of place. Yeah! These guys? If you are looking for the smartest, toughest, craftiest bunch of cats in the world... keep looking. But... like it or not, they're my crew, Top Cat's crew. Keep it together, boys. This is a rescue mission, remember? What is the meaning of this outrage? I'm finding traces of bacteria, sir! And A, B, C and D Coli! Check out this muffin! I don't think those are raisins. This place is haunted with ghosts. And they've been sneezing on the food! Oh, ghost germs! The worst kind! If you do not leave this instant, I'm calling the police! My good man, I am Federal Health Inspector, Felix Snagglepuss! I outrank the police. Is this badge made of cheese? Oww! Of course not! With all the violations, it's a miracle people don't explode on contact with your food. I had to give you a health rating of... Z. Z minus! What? No, no! Sure Mr. Snagglepuss, the things you found will be fixed, if you delay this finding for just a few days. Yes, I'd like to, but we must return to Washington now. And staying one more day in New York is quite expensive, if you know what I mean. -This is where you bribe me. -But of course! Monsieur Snagglepuss, you seem to have dropped "this" five thousand dollars! And "this" five thousand... Twenty? "This" twenty thousand dollars! Ahh, now, we're talking. Make it a good hundred thou and we're good. But Monsieur! I do not have access to that much money! In that case, thank you for your time. -You had a lovely place here. -No! It's-- it's-- it's-- it's a misunderstanding. You will have it, but it must come from... Mr. Big. Mr. Big? Mr. Big you say? Shhhh! His name must never be spoken. -But it was you who said Mr... -Shhhh. Okay, go to him. The private elevator to his basement office is just there. I'll let him know you're coming down. I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. We have, uh... une petit situation. I hate situations. Do you know what I did to the last guy who told me we had a situation? Help me! It's about the Health Inspector. He's headed up to you. He says he'll shut us down if you don't give him a hundred thousand. That's not the health inspector, you idiot. How you know this? Because... I'm paying off the health inspector -right now! Although, now that I think of it... -Oh? What? Oh. I'll send someone to beat you up. No, wait! I need my goons to take care of the fake health inspector. You'll have to beat yourself up. Pardonnez-moi? Do it! Oh, ow! Hey Top Cat, these guys must be getting bribed by Mr. Big just like us. Brain, my friend. These gentlemen here are goons who want to beat the living days out of us! We don't want to, we're paid to. I want to. Ahm, we're getting paid? -Well in that case... Cheese it, boys! Whoa! Sorry. Follow me. What about the rescue mission, TC? Ah, what mission? Mmmh, a tactical retreat. Now, now, this way. This way to freedom! Looks like you cats are in a real predicament. And ain't nobody can get you out of it but this cat. Pull us up! Please! I don't want to die. Please, we're desperate! No we are not. But even so you could help us. Because we are nice and you are nicer. Not because we're desperate. Because we're not. Okay, okay, I lied, I lied! We are desperate, please help! Err... Why should I stick my neck out for you? I used to be just like this guy. I was new to the city and trying to make an honest living. Excuse me my fine feline, what is it you're attempting to do? Well, times are tough at home. My ma works a dozen jobs. I wanted to bring some extra dough to buy some food. A fine sentiment. What did you say your name was? My name's Benny! But everybody calls me "Hey you!" or "Get out of my sight!" Pleased to meet you, Benny. You can call me Top Cat. There should be music when I say that. Trumpets, shouldn't there be trumpets? I only got a violin. Well Benny, I'm afraid that unless you and your mum fancy eating some wood and some strings, this violin is not going to stop your hunger. It isn't? But no worries, you are in luck. Am I? Yes, because you have just met me! And, if it's good for business, you might consider taking in a partner. -In other words, never work hard, if you can get some poor shmuck to do it for you. That was amazing! We are rich! My financial ambitions are a little higher than this. But it wasn't bad. Dare I say we even had...a ball? And since you were part of that, I dub thee Ball, Benny the ball. Oh, do you say "Benny the Ball" because I'm fat and I look like a ball? I like it! Now to divide this money up evenly, this is yours. And after my commission, my agent's fee, sidewalk tax, violin license and string tariff... Yay, thanks! You're a true friend! Take it. It's yours now. Dapper, thank you. So, now that we're friends and all, I want you to come for dinner with my ma. Oh, you're sweet kid, but truth to be told, the only true friend I seek is money. -It's not you, it's just that I'm ambitious and have vision and you don't. Oh, I see. Ha ha, of course, none of this is an impediment for you, me, and this delightful mother of yours having dinner together. -Let's go! -Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, who put rocket fuel in your juice boxes? -Let go! We've got to... - Aha! Caught you two, little tiger drafts! Officer! What is the problem? These two cat burglars just robbed a bakery! Why that's impossible! These upstanding youths have being showing my companion and me around the city all day. Isn't that true Benny? don't know what's happening. They haven't left our sight for a moment. In fact, I was just getting ready to compensate them for their trouble. Eh... thank you, mister! Well, I guess I... My mistake. Apologies, boys. -What is wrong with you? -We're underprivileged? No, I mean why would you steal? When there are so many suckers who'll just give it away? Cheshire Tom with the New York Tourism Bureau. The fee for staring at the Empire State Building is five dollars. You see? We've got to steal stealable things. If we don't, he'll burn down the orphanage we live in. Who will? The strongest, roughest, bad, baddest tough guy there is. -They call him... Bad Dog! Here he comes now! Please, Mister, we've got to give the loot to Bad Dog or else! Charity for the poor. Oh! Listen here, my canine buddy, there's no need to be harsh on this poor-- Are you okay, mister? Bad Dog, indeed. We're so glad you could join us for dinner, Top Cat. One more minute, though. What did you say you do? Oh, a little of this... No! Help! Ma, on the count of three! -One, two... The sofa. -He tried to eat me! Yes, yes, we here not the only hungry ones here! Oh, I'm sorry, this house is as old as its owner. Let's just eat! Yes please. I can't wait to try your tasteful... eh... stew. Wow! We got some orange peels. And real eggshells! Can we afford all this, ma? Only the best for company. Benny says you're a busy woman. What exactly do you do, Mrs. B? Oh, I take in a little laundry, do a little sewing. That's nice-- Make decorative cat collars, fix taxi meters, tune pianos, calibrate x-ray equipment, write user manuals, proofread textbooks. Okay, eh... And make puppets out of dryer lint. Oooh, you very handsome! I'll go get us some used dishwater to drink. Benny, if you and I are gonna do business together, you must change your habits. We are cats with expensive tastes. We? I thought you said you didn't want me along. I said I didn't want any friends. I didn't say anything about partners. And that's me? Indubitably! Benny, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership. Dibble, get in here! I've been hearing good things about you, Officer Dibble. Sir, you can't listen to a bunch of gossip about... Wait, good things? I'm giving you a promotion! Oh, thank you, sir! I can't wait to tell my granny, she'll be so proud of me. -Maybe? For once. -Okay, now listen. I'm giving you the blocks around Hoagie's Alley. Yeah, that's right. There's been a recent surge in cat-related shenanigans and I need an officer I can trust. B-- b-- but, but, but, sir that area belongs to... Mr. Big! Well, if that's the way you feel about it... Send in Officer Lopez! Hi, there! I've been hearing good things about you, Officer Lopez. I'm giving you the Hoagie's Alley beat. Don't thank me yet. True, it's on Mr. Big's turf, but... Well, Dibble, it looks like you're the man for the job after all. Congratulations. You really are a genius, Top Cat. You know that? Yes, I do, Benny. Yes, I very much do. You know? I just have an instinct about what doorbell to ring. Like I can always tell... -...where the perfect sucker is. Delivery! You're the mind-blowing winner of a glowy and goldy something Cop! Wow! I wonder what it could be? Nothing! It's nothing! It's wrong address. Wait a second! You're those scam cats the chief told me about. Cheese it! "Cheese it" means run! Come back here! Wha-- -Scoop of strawberry, please. Benny? Ooh, chocolate! You two! Don't just stand there. Pay the man, would you? -Oh, of course. Sorry. -I like this cop. -Me too, Top Cat. Mmm! Shall we? Whoa... That was a close call. Oh, nonsense, he never stood a chance. We make a great team. Gentlemen, lady, so nice to- Cut the chitchat, cat. Ha! Say that five times fast. Chitchat cat! Chitchat cat! Chit-chack-- Stop making noises from the mouth hole! Couldn't help but notice a yellow cat just like you has been sniffing around and running scams in Mr. Big's neighborhood. Now, you got three choices. One, you can stop. Two, you can carry on and pay Mr. Big a ninety-nine percent convenience fee. Three, you stop, but this time you'll have stopped 'cause you ain't breathing no more. Now, this ninety-nine percent convenience fee can I assume, be negotiated? Understood. Hey TC, do you think they're gone? Let's wait a little longer just to make sure. That was... bracing. It's nice in here, actually. It kind of smells like home. Are you kidding? I would never call a trashcan "home". But who is this Mr. Big everybody talks about? He is the most dangerous gangster in town. Apparently, he and his crew pulled off that diamond heist last week. Benny my boy, we just got ourselves a new pet project. Ma says I can't have any pets on account I ain't responsible enough. I once had a cat for a while but it turned out it was me. I knew those mugs would lead us right to the diamonds. We're gonna take them from them, and it won't be even stealing 'cause they are already stolen. Benny, have you ever heard of the eminent Doctor Sylvester Garfield? -Nope. -Neither have they. I'm taking the diamonds to the safe house. You guys rustle up some dinner. And it better not be margherita pizza again. Idiots! You guys are dumb. Oh, yeah. So much margherita. What the...? What are you doing? Do not touch that cat! Who are you to tell me what to do with this filthy fat cat? I am Doctor Sylvester Garfield, expert in infectious diseases. And you are touching a patient with deadly "lupubolavia-B" virus. Better known as The Undertaker Flu. Ahh, another victim of The Undertaker. He sneezed in my face! He sneezed right in my face! Oh, that's really bad right there, but it was only minutes ago. One! No, I'm dying! One and a half! I'm gonna die! There might be a chance for you, my beefy friend. Here, hold still as I administer these life-saving eye drops. Look up to the sky! The sky is your only hope. Do it now or I'll fix you good. Remember, you asked for it. This is the most pain I've ever felt in my entire life! Does that mean it's working, Doctor Garfield? Yah, but you should drink the rest. Drink the rest of the eye drops? It can only help your chances. And I should very much like to see what happens. Give me that! Congratulations, you are cured. You saved my life, doc! What do I owe you? I'll do anything! Nothing, the bill has been paid in full. Good day to you, sir. I can't stop looking at them! I think I'm in love with them. I can't sleep, I can't eat, and I think they deserve better than me! Hey, who pooped in my bag? Orange peels? Egg shells? And a rotten cabbage? Someone's gonna pay for this! Oh, I can't wait for the stores to open. I want to buy it all! I'll begin with that lamppost over there! Don't you think we should keep ourselves from spending? Perhaps open an investment account, save for retirement? You're right, if I hold on to these, I'm gonna spend it all in no time. But who? Who can I trust to keep these babies safe? Well, your buddy Benny, of course! Ok, I suppose you earned it. Listen to me, Benny, this is really important. Are you sure I can trust you? I need a verbal yes or no. Don't worry, TC, I'm the best at hiding things. Well, as long as I left you the easy part, I'll do the most difficult, dangerous, important part. Sure, TC, and what's that? Reservations! Oh, what a night! Although, are you sure we should be out so soon after our heist, TC? It's called hiding in plain sight. Another round of "milktinis"! And get some salmon bits for yourself. And back to that hiding issue... Where did my star hider hide my little treasure? Your star hider? Oh, oh, that's me! It seems you're one of our finest clients tonight. The manager wants to meet you. I tell you, Benny, sometimes it seems like the world is out to make everything just perf-- So, you think you can come into my nightclub and pay your way with one of my diamonds? Benny, did you know that Mr. Big owns this nightclub? Yes. Ah! And why did you not tell me this? You didn't ask. Mr. Big, I can explain! This was all a misunderstanding! Like what you see, Cat? Are you kidding? All you need is a plastic surgeon and a toupee and you could be in the movies! Horror movies. Look, you're a businessman. I'm sure we can work this out. Of course we can. Ape! Ooh! I love water slides! Now, I could tell you how we're gonna work this out, but I'd rather show you. Yeah, show them boss! So tell me, Bad Dog, who lost my diamonds to these two gentlemen? Oh, that! Well, sir, I-- I... want to be straight with you. It was Ape. Were you... paying attention? I actually had something in my eye, so I missed most of it. Could you should us again? We understand. Shoved into the bottomless pit... bad. Mr. Big, very bad. Well, glad we could work this out! Thanks, boys! I'll just make this short. My gang runs all the crime in this city. It's allowed me to collect treasures from around the world. But none of them are as rare or as valuable as those diamonds. Each one is worth millions! So I just need to know one thing... Where are the rest of my diamonds? Really, I don't know! Right, the begging and screaming thing. Oh, okay, I'll tell you where they are. Wrong, you'll take us to them. Bad Dog will go with you. That way, if you're lying, he can beat the truth out of you. Oh, please be lying! Now go get my diamonds! Gee, Top Cat, I really wish you had asked me if Mr. Big owned this club. Me, too, Benny. Me, too. Well, don't just stand there, hand over the diamonds, cats! Yes, the diamonds. You're standing on them. Benny, be a dear and help the gentleman here pulling the floor boards and digging the diamonds out, while I sit and rest for a moment. Digging them out? Err... not so fast! I'll be the one doing all the sitting here and you dig the stones out, What? Get me out of here! Grab the stones and let's scram! -About that... All right, you hid them in like a secret compartment? Does on the kitchen table count as a secret compartment? What? Well, they don't seem to be there! -I know. -What? They're gone? Millions of dollars! Oh, you're so dead! Pull me out, now! Excuse us, my associate and I have to step out for a moment. Run! -Okay, cheese it! -Coming! What? No! Come back here, you two! You no good, miserable pieces of scum! I'm gonna make violins out of your guts. You're only making it harder on yourselves, you pathetic furballs. Come back! They're getting away! Gone, they're gone! How could I have trusted you with something so important? All my dreams vanished. I was so close! - What happened, boss? -Took you long enough! Get me out of here! No, wait! Get those cats! No, search for the diamonds! Oh, do something! Not only am I gonna get killed, but I'm gonna be a poor corpse! I'm gonna be so...! Oh, hello, Mrs. B. Oh dear, why is our furniture running away? -No, Ma, they're looking for the-- Spanish doubloons! They're pirates! You know how it is with them, always the looting and plundering! Oh goodie! I hope they finally take away that blasted sofa of ours. Yes, seems that would take a while. Maybe we should let them do their job. Oh that's fine. Tonight is bingo night and I've made some extra dough and I wouldn't mind doubling tonight. Wanna come? Oh, no thanks, you go and have some fun. Not you. You're coming with me! Do-do, be doop do, parara-ching! Tat-tat, tarira, rat-tat-tat... Oh! Hi, Officer! The door was unlocked so we let ourselves in. The door wasn't unlocked! It was after we hit it a few times with a shovel. But enough witty banter. You've got to protect us! We had a little... misunderstanding with Mr. Big. Yes, he kind of thought we had taken his diamonds. And he turned out to be right! Well, okay, he understood quite well actually. You? You're the ones who stole from Mr. Big? From my point of view, it doesn't count as stealing when the stuff is already stolen. That's recycling. This is huge, huge! You guys are gonna help me catch Mr. Big! I mean-- Mr. Big. Look, it's us! Reward? These guys! Fifty thousand dollars and ninety five cents? Don't worry! Officer Dibble here will protect you. If anything happens to you, he'll be fired. Huh? So don't be afraid. I'm sure you won't have any problem. Alright, good morning, everybody! -Get them! - Yeah! Oh! -Ah! -Ooh, ha, ahh! I'm an experienced officer. This is humiliating. Benny, did you...? Did you use that diaper? I'm just trying to be authentic. All passengers to Boonsville, this is the last call. We just got to get you past those guys. Once you're in the suburbs, Granny Dibble will take care of you. -Wonderful, I love being taken care of! Aw, isn't that nice? -What do we have here? -Huh? What cute little... -Duuhhh... -...babies, I'm guessing? Because the thing they have around there. Ouch! Hey! Why, you little...! -Look what you did! You scared him! Heh-heh. I may have overfed him a bit. The little imp! But I must get my little cherubs on that train. Here, lady, let us help you. Thank you. What nice young men. Well I'll be off. Have a wonderful time, sweeties! -Wait. You're gonna let your kids go on a train by themselves? Oh, they're very mature for their age. So I'm sending them to college earlier. Ta-ta! I know if I had a mom that cared that much about me, I think I could have been President. Oh... Not now, Benny. I was so close. Ahhh... Are you Officer Dibble's grandmother? No, you're much too young. Surely you must be his sister! Don't you sweet talk to me. Oh! Ahhh. Shh, over here. Call me Granny. Now how about we get you fellas to your new home? We have to get going! This whole place is full of southern Confederate goons! What? I imagine you'll be wanting to eat! And lobster ravioli with saffron cream sauce, with pear and prosciutto salad on the side. And eh, island duck meatballs with green mustard and pistachios... -I like cabbage! -No cabbage! And coquilles St-Jacques à la Parisienne, and... A cracker? No, half a cracker. -There's two of you. -But... Are you arguing with me, maggot? Maggot? Yes, maggot, you'll get a meal when you have done your chores. And not one second before! Do you understand, maggot? Now, share that cracker! Now, you're going to do some chores. Do you hear me, maggots? -They hear you in Germany. -Good! We must remain eternally prepared. And how do we do that? Plenty of rest and rich food? No! We do it with chores! Here is the list of chores you will do every day. Well, that's not so... -Ah! -Oh! Now get cracking, maggots! This isn't a chore exactly. -Move it, move it, move it! Oh. Yeah! Huh? I've devoted my life to avoiding work, because I always pictured it being exactly like this. But look at the garden. It looks beautiful now! It shines like a diamond... Ooops! Let's stay away from the diamond subject. It's painful. I trapped him! We've got the lion! Brain, this is a cat. We've talked about the differences between one and the other before. I even showed you pictures, remember? Ahhh... Of course I'm a cat! What are you six looking at? Be careful, this lion is really angry! Stop, lion, stop! But he is a cat. Indeed! Now, what's all the fuss about? And where did the other three go? We're really sorry. I'm Choo Choo. And my friends here are Fancy Fancy and Brain. And I'm Brain! We're clowns at the local circus. Well, I guess we were. Yes. It seems one of us thought he could ask the lion to wait out of this cage for a little moment while he was cleaning it. Really? Who? Oh, you mean me! Yes, I did. Brain, by the way. Yes, as in Brainless. And who are you two? For your information, I'm a protected witness. A very important one. You can call me Top Cat. -Huh, still no trumpets. -Hey, hello! Yeah, and he is Benny. The Ball. Whatever. What are we gonna do now? Being clowns was the only job we could get! So you are looking at a career opportunity, I assume? It so happens I have a once-in-a-lifetime opening in my business corporation. Money, girls, cars, anything you might want. Must say it's not for everyone, but if it's something that fits your needs, I might consider you. -No, we want lions. -Don't mind him, go on. Well, it's a very tough and discerning process. You will be tested and taught in the ways of a luxurious life. -What do we have to do to join? -Follow me, let's get started. -Yey! -Yeeeeeey! Why don't you just stay here and finish that fence? Alright, let's see what issues we need to focus on. Well, I get pushed around a lot. Roughed up, pummeled, savagely beaten. -So you want to toughen up? -Yeah! Then you need... -Mop Fu! -Mop Fu? The Way of the Mop, highly advanced martial arts. Even ninjas are afraid of Mop Fu experts. Even ninjas? Wow! And you, Brain? What's your problem? People think I'm dumb. I'd like to be smarter. Aha, I see. -Because people think I'm dumb. -Right. -So I'd like to be... -Smarter! Got it, let's see. Ah, here we go! Read this and you'll know how to repair a complex piece of machinery! You'll be a rocket scientist in no time! "With the sparking plug inverted, unbolt the brindle clamp from the transverse torque coupler." Wow, I feel smarter already! And what's your damage? I'm a romantic cat, my problem lies within. I yearn for a soul mate, but whenever I speak to the ladies mine tongue becomes tangled and unwieldy. I can't even meow properly. Well, no problem my amorous friend. Here you go! Ladies can't resist French, it's the language of love! This is gonna make you a regular "Cats-anova." Ooo-la-la, I'm swooning here! And while you're doing that, wash the windows. But what does that have to do with learning French? Are you questioning me, maggot? Sir, no sir! Ki-ya! Ki-Ya! Ki-ya! Ki-ya! Ki-ya! Ki-ya! Pie Inspector, ma'am. We're gonna have to inspect your pies. Cherry, apple, that lemon merengue number there, and... Was that badge made of cheese? Ma'am, the penalty for hindering a federal pie inspection is quite severe! Please, let us do our work. Oh, oh! Okay, thank you. Here they are. Huh? Huh? Yeah, it's me, put me through with... Mr. Big. I see. Hey Top Cat, tell us about your life in the big city. The thing is, sure, there are some bad kitties out there. But I can always outthink them. And when you add that I happen... -...to be the toughest cat there is, you have an unbeatable combination. Thine appearance is not one of brutish force, though. Yeah, no muscles. I use the most important one my brain! I want to be the nice cat, the reasonable feline. But if there's ever a time I have to become Mister Sabre Tooth Tough cat, I can! And that's why they call me... Top Cat! So you see, there's no one, no one who tells me what to do, and I'm not afraid of anyone! Hey, hi Rat! It's Rat! You know what? You guys keep working. We're going to, uh... run out and get you some ice cream! Hello, cats. You shouldn't have crossed Mister Big, cat. Oh, of course! You must be Mister Big's stupid goons. Top Cat's always talking about how incredibly dumb you are! Don't listen to them, I never said such a thing. Yeah, he told us how dumb you are. You should meet Mister Big's stupid goons. They are undoubtedly the dumbest thugs in town! See? This little sniveling, lying feline has been feeding you a bag of bull. He ain't tough. He's the cowardliest, snivelingest, grovelingiest con cat anyone has ever had the misfortune to know! Okay, where were we? Get your stinking paws off my cat! -Huh? Ya! Take this! Oh, isn't that adorable? Get out of here! Run and keep running! I'll be all right. -You heard the lady! Bah! - Huh? Uh-oh. - Yeee-haw! Well, I've enjoyed meeting you but I have to move on. Bye! This is it? Are you going away, just like that? Don't leave, we need you. When we met you we were just simple buffoons, and look at us now. Chased by the city's most dangerous monsters! Who are out to kill us! How could we ever thank you? Hey, it's not all bad news. You've all passed my training! -Can you repeat? -What? Of course you have. You are now honorable members of my gang. Yeeeeeyyy! And as honorable members of my gang, you must pay your membership fee! -Yaayyy! -What? That'll be five hundred dollars each. We've got a buck, forty. And a dead grasshopper. -Deal! You can keep the bug. -Yay! Only a chosen few have this badge. You must honor it, live up to it. And most importantly, pay me each month for a yearly maintenance fee. -Understood? -No badge for me? Ah, you don't need it, you're coming with me, Benny the Ball. -Give me your hand. -What? Okay now, first of all we got to call for help. All I need is a payphone. Great! Benny boy, hand over the dollar, forty our former associates gave us, please. What? Alright then, I guess we'll have to walk to my old friend, Officer Dibble. He'll know what to do. What? Officer Dibble is your friend? But he's a cop! Why is he and I'm not? Because a friend would never lose something his friend asked him to take care of. I'm sorry, let's go, okay? Anyway, as I told you before. I work better solo. Okay, TC. Guess I'm... gonna check on my mom. s Mom] I've had about enough from you, Mrs. Handy! I've got a half a mind to... What, hit me? You don't have the guts! Ma! Benny boy! Oh, my boy, my precious baby boy! I've been so worried about you! It's true, she won't shut up about it. I'm okay, ma. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you where I was. After those hooligans tore the place apart, well, I was just beside myself. I would never have had the money to fix the place up, if I hadn't used those sparkly beads you left to make a fancy cat collar. Oh, I'm sorry, Ma, I... Sparkly beads? Yes, the ones you left in the leather bag. You made a cat collar out of them? For who? That singer lady, the one at the nightclub? She's very glamorous! Ooo-la-la! Furletta DuChat! At the Starlight Club? Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Top Cat won't be mad at me anymore! Thanks, Ma! Tam-taramtam, tam, tam, tam... Hmmm. Hmm-hmm! You take a lot of showers, Officer. You should try licking your body up. It's healthier for your skin. Oh, is that so? You should be at Granny's! The goons showed up. What? Is she okay? Of course she is. Those poor goons. But where's Benny? -He went to check on his mom. -What?! No! Mister Big has his goons watching that place! I need you both to bust Mr. Big! Oh gosh, if this gets to Chief Thumbton, I'll be fired! Let's go! -Pants first! -A wise choice. -Pst! Why, if it isn't Top Cat! Shh! Benny here? I think he went to the Starlight Club. Would you like a rotten cabbage? Hehe, no thanks, I'm watching my figure. Huh? Oh, silly-silly me! I forgot my catnip! Miss DuChat! Oh god, this is a hit! -Miss DuChat, please, come. Miss DuChat! they're demanding an encore! -You've got to get out here! -What's the problem? Miss DuChat. We need her to come out right away out but she doesn't answer. Don't worry, sir. I'll take care of this. Miss DuChat, step aside! I will burst the door open -... in a dramatic fashion on three. One. Ahhh? -But, but, I... - What's next? Oh yeah... Two! We must find Benny, remember? We already have, I guess. Oh, Benny boy! I love you, you are magnificent! Oh! -Oh my gosh! -Oh! Furletta DuChat is bald? No! She stole from Mr. Big! Oh, whatever, just go, get him! -Come back here you! I'm back! Oh, oh, oh. I found them! -I found them! -What? I said I found them! Huh? Uh-ohh! Oh, Get up! They're getting away. Hey, that's the cat Mr. Big is offering a reward for! Those men took Benny through that door. Lovely evening, gentlemen. Okay, you asked for it! Wait, we need to rescue Benny. Taxi! You've got to hide until things cool down a bit. Here is some money, go to Florida. To the airport! I promise I'll rescue Benny. Sir? Sir! Sir? I said coach, business or first class? Eh... First-- first class, I guess. No, wait! Do you have anything more expensive than first class? Well, there's Platinum Class. It's just like first class, but you get to rest your feet on a tourist class person. I'll take it! And forget about Florida. Make it Saint-Tropez! Yes, sir. Ohh, platinum class! Can you put that up, sir? We're about to take off. Of course. You're a true friend. Take it, it's yours now. Your attention, please. There will be no more departures today. Thank you. Do-do, be doop-doop do... Doot-doot-- Would you stop doing that? Oh, just get used to it! Dibble, we're gonna rescue Benny. -What? We? -Yes, but we can't do it alone. -You won't have to. What's this now, Grand Central Terminal? Hey, what are you guys doing here? Well, TC, with those goons after you, we thought you might need our help. Granny Dibble told us you might be here and gave us a spare key. And I wanted to show you this ice cube I found that's shaped like a cow! Oh no, someone stole my ice cube! And my pocket's wet! So what do you say, are we a gang again? Yes, yes we are! My liege, are you-? Of course not! My eyes are just sweating! Yeah yeah, very moving. But how are we gonna rescue Benny? Elementary, my dear Dibble! Do you have any cheese? -I need to carve a badge. - No! No cheese! Never! We're gonna talk to Chief Thumbton! I told you, Dibble, what would happen to you if anything happened to them! You're discharged from Mr. Big's case! Get out of my sight! Go wash my car! B-- b-- but... Not another word out of that mouth! Leave my car alone! You're fired! Does Chipotle Cheddar work for you? So, like I said before this long flashback, why should I stick my neck out for you? Listen bro, how about you take our tailed buts us out of here and bring us to Mr. Big? You get the reward and then we escape. A win-win! Meows. Wait! How come you know about this secret door? I used to work for Mr. Big. But now I'm-- I'm just his slave! His pizza slave! Pizza. That big fat gangster took my baby away from me. I loved Eleanore so much! Ain't this just the best thing in the world? Apart from all the threatening and the killing, a really burning-hot Margarita pizza! It's cold! You have insulted me. Now you'll have to deliver me hot pizza every day, without Eleanore! Because she is going to be as cold as my Margarita! -No! Eleanore was your bike? A hell of a hell cat, you're. Yes. And I owe her. I want Mr. Big to feel the loss of something he really loves. Cats, I have a plan. Yes, again. We'll use the diamonds to rescue Benny and free you from Mr. Big! Are you in? I'm in! I've been following you around so we could join forces, man. My enemy's enemy is my friend. My name is Spook, Hell Cat Spook. Deal, Hell Cat, Spook! Now, I know how to take down Mr. Big for good! I don't know, pulling a con on Mr. Big will be tough. And who said anything about fooling Mr. Big? Say, boss. The pizza guy is here! We didn't order that much food. If you expect me to pay for all that-- Trust me. There's a little something extra in this box that you're gonna love. Oh, is it garlic bread? Well, well... Aw, it's just stupid Top Cat! You've been a nuisance to me and my operation, cat. And you're gonna pay... with your life. Allow me to talk you into more interesting ways of collecting. -I can offer you... -Quiet! -Bla-bla-bla! Now let's make a deal. You get Top Cat, and I get Benny. I've got a score to settle with that fur ball. Get me out of here. -Ooh, one second. I've got a score to settle with that fur ball. A personal vendetta, eh? I like your style. Move it, you're free! I'm free? Yay! Wait, what's the catch? He's probably going to kill you. Alright, hand over Top Cat. Not just yet. I also want the reward money! You want both? -He wants both! A-ha, ha,ha,ha... A-ha, eh...! You can have one. Fine, I'll take Benny. All right, I'm free! Come on. Just one more thing. If you found Top Cat, then you found my diamonds too. Hand them over. Now! Here you go, boss. Yes, my diamonds. Come to papa! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! See what he wants with the blue one. And then, take care of him permanently. This is it Fancy. Your shining moment. Help! You've got to help me! Help, someone help! Me... Top Cat! Why won't anyone help me? Me! Fan... I mean, Top Cat! Got ya! Hey, what's going on? Mind your own business! This cat is mine, all mine! Wait a minute! That's the guy from the wanted posters! And the reward is fifty-thousand dollars! I want that reward! No, I want that reward. He wants the reward. Well, too bad, because I found him first! -Hey! -Please, everyone, calm down. Look closely. It doesn't say that only one person can collect the reward. Why, technically, you can each get fifty-thousand dollars... -for turning me in! - Hold on a second! It almost sounds like you want to get caught! Anyone else think I want to get caught? -No, man, it's cool. -Good. Get him! Help, someone help, help please! Hey, what's Top Cat doing here? Help, they're right after me! I'll explain later. Keep moving! Hey, what's that cat doing in here? Oh, I'll escape deeper into my enemy's hideout. I want Top Cat's blood. I'll save you, Top Cat! No, Benny, come back here! Hey, come back here, you! - Ouch, oh, ow, ouch! -Bienvenue. Table for three-hundred? Come on, he went this way! Oh, hey, a pizza crumble! Hey, is there any chance you can pass me some Parmesan? Hm, crunchy, not bad... Shut up, cat! I've had it with you! Everyone shoot that box and spare no ammo! On my count. One, two... - I'll save you, Top Cat! -Benny! What are you doing? We caught Top Cat. And we each came to collect the 50 grand! You idiots! That's not Top Cat! I already have Top Cat trapped inside this box! I'm too handsome to die! Shoot that box already! Ouch! Top Cat? Have you forgotten good old me? Anyone around, anyone? No, no! Where is Top Cat? May I have your attention, please? So you've all decided to pursue a career on bounty hunting. A wise choice. But why settle for a measly 50 grand? Ha! I, my fine friends, can offer you something better! Wow! Something better is almost always better! What have you got, bud? Everyone get out of my place and shut that guy up! -Shh! -Huh? Please continue. -A priceless burial masks. Straight from the grave -to your door! It's like having an Egyptian king right in your own home, but without the stench of his rotting corpse. I always wanted to be buried in an Egyptian mask! What else are you offering? -Bars of gold! Each one more... goldier than the last! Hey, how do I know that's real gold? Wow! That is real gold! And you all thought that 50 thousand dollars was a lot? Well, how about fifty thousand and one! But tell us, just how can we obtain such precious items? Bring Mr. Big in to the police! But act now, because this offer ends in two minutes! Oh no! What are you doing? Get away from me! What are you waiting for? Take care of Top Cat's gang! You made big mistake. Oh! Was that French? I never could resist French! Oh! Ooh la-la! You know? You're actually quite beautiful. Say goodbye! No, stay! Bad Dog! Bad Dog! Bad Dog! -Cheese it! Ow! Ow! Ah, Mop Fu! Huh? You know, Mr. Big? I feel sorry for you. You have money, power and priceless treasures. But you don't have the one thing that really matters. Friends. Friends like mine. Huh? Nooooooo...! I really should've thought of a better line. The friends thing was kind of cheesy. Oh, oh, I know! Hey, hey, Mr. Big... Yeah, that's better. Thanks for saving me, TC. Of course Benny, you're part of my crew. I mean, our crew. And we never leave a man behind. Well, here, I hope you can accept my apology. Apology accepted, friend! Well, with Mr. Big taken care of, we are free to do what we want. But what do we want? I'll tell you what we want! To start a new life in an amazing new place! Meet me in an hour and I'll explain everything! I've got something to do first. What!? Dibble!? I fired you! What are you doing here? What are any of you doing in here? Can someone who talks please tell me what's going on? Chief we caught the nasty beast who's been terrorizing the city. You caught my mother-in-law? That's rich! No, no, seriously though, no. We caught... Mr. Big. Nice work! We've been trying to bring him in for years! Mr. Big, your reign of crime is over! And, Dibble, you're back on the force! Thanks, Chief! Hey! What about our reward? Reward, what reward? Dibble! Oh, this is the perfect shiny spot for you. Woah, woah, why all this meowing and crying, shorties? They're closing the orphanage 'cause we can't pay the rent. Yes, and teacher says we must have a plant-a-tree-day... so we can remember something good happened today. Well, yes, we'll remember the tree, because we are going to live under it. Wait, wait a second, glum shorties! You can't plant trees in here! You see, I'm with the city's department of pipelines. And we're standing over the city's main Jell-O distribution center. Oh man! We won't even have a tree to live under! Hey, it's gonna be okay. Hey, kids, what do you know? I was holding my map upside down. No pipes here. Go, go dig yourselves crazy. - Look! - Diamonds! We found diamonds! Yeah! -We're saved! -We're rich! -Well done! -Tell me about it! The orphanage is saved! We have a home! Oh, yeah! Hey, TC, we're ready to start our new lives in our fancy new place! Yeah! Err... About that fancy new place, uh... It's here! -Looks homey! -It has a rustic romance to it! Did I mention how homey and rustic it looks? I was afraid we'd be in some sell-out penthouse, man! It's good to have friends, isn't it, TC? Friends, you guys? You're not my friends! You're my family. You mean it TC, are you sure? Of course, as sure as my name is Top Cat! -Hey, what do you know? Trumpets! Eh... who's next?
