Let him announce himself No humor, please Milic Gavranić is absent You see, he is practising boxing, and he will represent our school in this noble art What kind of nobility is that? To fight with others They breath onto each other Pull each other, touch each other with those sweaty bodies Touch is a horrible thing Left, right, direct in the forehead just keep on hitting it, all the time, you'll make it Teacher, is that a new soap perhaps? The sulfur one, from Russia ...a special one Quickly, back to your seats Today we will talk about protection from electricity Where is electricity the strongest? In... conduit That's ritght, in the conduit And where does conduit end? Again you In the substation Yes, in the substation You see, people die mostly because of electricity TO and IN substation For example, our substation is located under a road bridge it is totally unsecured, therefore very dangerious, why? You tell me You did not tell us what is so, but it is so, if you say so It may happen that one, passing over the road bridge, accidentally falls down to the substation That is also possible But there are other dangers, too For example A man gets drunk and heads home On the way, he of course feels the urge to urinate, is that right? He comes to the substation, and there we are One, especially a male person, considers it a great attraction to urinate from above the bridge road and it is, teacher yes, one would have to consent that it indeed is and that is how he starts urinating, directly into the power supply in the substation salty water is, we learned that, one of the best conducters of electricity, is that right? And what happens? It happens that the electricity him reversly, through his urine, and "the thing"... which thing? through "the thing"... kills Why are you like this Danica, why? What's wrong with you, Mihajlo? What am I to you? What can I say, you are nothing to me, but how much you can become, you can't evae dream of Are you writing this down? One musn't urinate from the bridge road... ...urinate from the bridge road, especially if a substation is underneath that is a principle of protection or to cut? now, neither cutting... Mihajlo, you are completely lost - I am, I am. And you, if you are a just discoverer, keep me... Just for a little while You Knežević, and Janković, you must be discussing the protection from the electricity, right? Yes, of course, teacher... It's just that Danica, she is afraid, she's having certain reserves let's here them If that would spread, says she, desperate ones would come from all over to our district... in order to finish with themsleves with an ordinary urinating And I am, teacher, seriously concerned that among us there will be somebody desparate who will go to that bridge road due to the unreturned loved you thought of me? - Yes Where are you going? We are skipping the class, and you are also going with us One may not skip classes - One may. may, may not, may... It wasn't you who invented skipping classes How many smart and educated people skipped classes this way Danice, please - Where are you headed? Let him go! Ok, I'll let him go... My nice little brother, my nice little brother You know, I am sick of both of you Love problems, huh? Watch what you are doing! How much of that had happened here Assistant, who is not present? Assistant escaped too. OK. Well, that's not the way it's going to be. Historia est magistra vita. History will teach you the lesson. One thing, you thought I was going to be questioning you today. Wanted to screw me? No, not happening. Danice, Danice.Danice. Children, children. Well you, you escaped from class. What are you doing here. Milic is analyzing force, and we are keeping him company. Milic, Milic... Professor, why doesn't it want to roll downhill? But Professor why doesn't it want to roll downhill?! Rousvelt said: I am ready to stay in Teheran as long as Marshall Stalin is here. Then Churchul spoke too. If it was necessary, I am ready to stay in Teheran forever. Collegue, were you keeping a log there at that time? Only one thing They escaped. Collegue I really don't know what to say. For godness sake, you are teaching to an empty classroom! Ah no, I wanted to have questioning today, but I don't have whom. I have to teach, I have no choice. I earn my professor's bread honestly. Yes, collegue Dragicevic, let's go, let's go. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Good afternoon Professor. Children, study history nevertheless! She is... We know Professor. The teacher of life. Magistra vita est. Good afternoon Professor. Please come on in Professor. One thing Professor, you are very dear to us. We will be saying good bye to each other soon, so we wanted you to know that. Yes Professor! Why do you run away from class? Why is it not leaving already? You didn't put too much effort in the send-off. That's why Professor when you come back it will be... When we come back as champions you will feel ashamed for sending us off this miserably! See you on Monday. Punch them well Tupo! Look through that window... What you doing there... Maybe you are finding your own peace. Are you looking at her now? You think about her... This one really doesn't know to quit. He is unbelievably stubborn. Is he bothering you? I don't know. He can be funny and sometimes I find him really kind. Dear? Funny? That guy is just a fool! Can you be funny? Me? I can do everything! Yeah? Let me hear? -Let me just remember. So? I need to remember! Bad luck! Listen to this: better duck on a plate, than a goose under the arm. Ha? If that's not funny, I really don't know what is funny. Broken hearts... That loved shortly... That beat forever... And kept the love faithfully... Who ordered the music? We did. We are going to welcome the champion! But we have class at the &quot;Fat Hill&quot;. First to greet the champion. As the director said, unless you say differently. OK, in that case, I will go first, and you'll follow me, in two lines. And music behind us. Straight to train station. For the champion three times Hurray: Hurray, hurray, hurray! And where is the winner? - Who? - The champion? - I don't know, I am travelling incognito. And student Milic, where is Milic? Where are you Tupo, champion? Hey, there he is! - Tupo! What is it, Tupo? You got your nose upgraded? OK, ok, friends, tease me, so that we can be done with it. Sorry Tuppo, but the opportunity for it is so good! He closed eyes to you,ha? Which sallon do you go to? Tupo, wherever you look at it is all blue, ha? It's really romantic... When they knock you down you don't need to worry about astronomy class, that's something I know, but I don't know for how long! When he was putting you to bed, was he singing softly over you? I hope he was gentle! Today we are going to be practicing the security of the road on Fat Hill. I will be driving. And you will be behind the curves to wave at me if you see someone coming from the opposite direction. Knezevic, what are you talking about while I am explaining? Well, I don't know Professor if this excercise is the security of the road or your training in driving? They call you Philosopher, ha? You could cut your hair, so that they don't cut your hair there. I will, I will. The training in driving of every individual strengthens the war readiness of our people! That's right! Besides, while you are waiing flags at me, we will be practicing - what Philosopher? Codes, that is secret understanding! That's right. Even in ancient Rome, Cesarus was gladly speaking in codes. What is that? That's one Cesarus thought that is seldomly quoted? I don't understand, I forgot, what was that again? It is nice to be at war with nice girls? Straight to corner! Which one? There behind that bush. You citing Cesarus' weak thoughts. Instead of saying... - I came, I saw, I conquered! That is right! Veni vidi vici! OK come back. Bogoljub, distribute the flags and distribute the people. Don't yawn there - watch the road! Hey hey hey hey hey, don't strech! Give them the signal to start! Danica! What Mihailo? I would like, boundless love for myself, to share with someone. Oh really? What is it? What are you doing here man? There is no violation here! Allow me, I took all measures of precaution! Well you blocked the traffic! What kind of traffic? You see there is no traffic! Well of course there isn't, when you have been blocking it for the entire hour! You hear? Let's go, climb behind. I am a professor of safety training, called Nesa Kutuzov. Let's go, let's go. Listen here, from this moment on you are all on a field trip. Everything you do between each other and that you talk, I have to know! Before or after? Collegue, I just remember the poem of one of my collegues from Banja Luka, who wrote the poem: Suffering. Who has never taken children to Zagreb's state fair, they don't know what suffering is. Train is coming! Hey, brother, wait, I will do it! Brother, be nice! What, I don't understand? If you leave her alone, I will give you Vespa, OK? Hey bro, you could wish us a safe trip! Hey there, who is going to pay for those drinks? Two brandies! Collegue Stevic took that defeat very difficult. Well he wanted to become a star over night. Collegue Bozovic, I would talk to him, but I don't know what. Tell him, the most important thing is to participate. I should tell him so? - Yes. Here Professor, you asked for me and I am reporting to you. Listen, no matter what happens here you are responsible. And that you let me know on time. I understand Professor. We were preparing for it thoughtfully... I know, but dear collegue, it is important to participate. I just uncovered myself for a moment, and he abused it very meanly. Bad luck! Don't uncover yourself not even in bed any more! Through being beaten up to the stars, ha? He only lowered his hands for a moment. There is no point in crying, no! Have you seen when the fast train goes into the tunnel? Well that is how it was. Well you were running in front of trains. Bad luck! Immediately appologize to our friend, Gavranic! -I am sorry Milic. OK. You are very cute. I like you better like this, than a show off. Where does it hurt? - Here. - And more? - Here. I am in charge and I won't allow... Well are we still going to be on "you", or should we move on to kisses? I won't allow nothing unpredictable. Opa, not it's coming Bacevci and Bacevci tunnel! You are not that crazy?! - Yes I am. I will run for you. - Yoo don't have to! -I will run with you. You were hit by a fast train, and you are still racing with the commercial ones, that's your mistake! Professor, it wasn't my fault, Milic Gavranic and Jova Slobenovic. What they got into a fight? - No even worse! They raced with the train! And the train was faster?! - No they were. - Oh thank God. Lucky you! - Why? - You can wait calmly for your future. On my back! To cut the sleepiness... Oh, I am sorry... - Please excuse me. This will be registered by the seizmological centre! A bit more a bit more. Let's go! Everyone to the hall! Get ready! Streching! And... One, two, Watch your arms, Three, Four. Nicely, two, three, four. Here it is, Belgrade, Belgrade, the capital. Allow me Danica. Mihailo, you are so golden. You see Professor, she already uses me. Allow me yours too. Mihailo! He is really golden! Milic and Slobenovic! Come into my room. What a nice room you have Professor. Wonderful view of post and train station. Sit down. For you two there is nothing of Belgrade today because of that train race in Bacevci. Exactly here, the old Slaves first crossed the river, in the direction of my hand. Now, look here. Remove that gentleman from there please. Professor, that is Ivo Andric. - Yeah right. Excuse me please, could you move just a bit? Look really! Could we ask our Nobel Prize winner to take a picture with seniors from the province? Please? I have read many books from you, such as, for example, like... Look here! This is Knez Mihailo, the national and historical figure! And our love will be historical, ha Danica, what do you think? Shut up already! - It is easiest to shut my mouth with a kiss, come on, come on if you dare! He's been riding for more than hundred years in the same direction, and in the same place! What is this? - A field trip! - 10.000. For what? - For bad guidance! But please, I am number one in Serbia for leading field trips. There is wine too! Until we go to the cinema, who wants, is free! Wait! Bad luck - here is the money, you will buy tickets for everyone. Professor, give it to me, I am stronger, if it is crowded, I'd better do it. Wait, where are you going, with the others? No not with the others, I have a date. I also have a date. Bye! Sir, you dropped this! Oh, oh thank you, who says today's girls aren't wonderful? Thank you very much! Nothing, nothing! - Have we met before? I see you for the first time! - Well thank God, I only believe in the love at the first sight! Wait, but wait! I would propose to you, but begging in the street is illegal. Ooow, you are short sighted - let me come closer to you! You dazzled me with your beauty! Please, please, take me across the street. Wait, where are the tickets? - I have them. - Give them. - No it's fine, you go in, I will come in the end. Hurry up, the movie is starting! Tickets? Behind. Tickets? Behind. One. - Thank you. Tickets. - Here you go. - And for the others? - What others? - Those who walked in front of you. Oh those, I don't know them. - Wait a minute, they were walking right in front of you! I don't know, who knows who doesn't walk in front of me these days... What happened, neighbour? Well 30 of them just entered without tickets. - Oh, those are the graduating seniors from the province, the city is full of those loafers. Professor, take. Please. Professor. Take. Professor, what is this? Boka Kotorska, the bride of Adriatic. Bad luck! Bad luck happened to Professor Stevic! Nothing, I knocked to wake him up and I couldn't hear anything, some bad luck happened! Let's go! Collegue Stevic, Collegue! I am not smart, what to do? You know what Professor, it is not needed smartness, but force. Professor, Professor. Man should quickly cut the sleepiness. Gavranic, hold him now, he will apply quick waking up again! Marina, Marina, Marina, you don't know that I love you. That over there is Perast, and this behind us is Gospa od Skrpjela. And behind there is Risan. Why aren't you looking? I cannot be more beautiful than the entire Boka? - You are a romantic Mihajlo. Me? Well they would see me how, having my eyes closed, I hug one small birchwood. Like this. What? -What happened next? Let me in peace, please, I barely came to here. - And all those love of yours? Well I am so shy that my girls were bringing me flowers to dates. Really? - Really. Gospa od Skrpjela is... What are you doing over there?! People's Police. Come in and have your ID's ready. No, please. - I told you so, I told you so! I fell off my feet chasing for you through the city. Thank God you are alive, even here. No documents, poor behaviour, not allowing the state organs to perfrom their duty. That you call the director, everyone! Hello? Who is this? WHO? Professor Bozovic told me to call you. No, I don't know, he didn't tell me! God protect. Who is it again? Professor told us that we call you. Good evening! Jovan Slobenovic! Room 42! -What room 42? Well, I thought that we could talk... Were you thinking about something else? Be quiet, Professor Bozovic will hear us. Tupo, Tupo, where are you Tupo?! There you are, there you are! OK, stop, stop, stop, calm down. You know what I would ask you? I know what you would ask me. Screw the lights. That is good for the atmosphere. It's good if Professor comes. Philospher wants to talk to you something. - What does he want now? - Well I don't know. Where are you going? - Hey, I wanted to talk to you. - Listen, I have a boyfriend, he is a student. When you see him, you think clouds came. We'd better not talk. OK, let's not talk. I was watching the sky, above the Himalayas... -And? - You have the eyes of the colour of the world. And? - And? I am not managing well, help me Danica, I can't find the right words, this is a really difficult crossword for me. Mihailo, you are shy... Who? Milena, who is with you? - Danica Jankovic? Where is Danica now? - She is here. She just went out for a sec for something. I know where she is. I came... I saw... I kissed. Knezevic, maybe you know where Danica is? No, why? Why is there no light in here? Both of you will call the principle! Professor, the principle is angry that we call him. Who called the principle and when? This night, you said so. And what did the principle say? I'd better not say what he said to me. Oh my God, my head will explode. Well colleagues, how was the field trip? Oh I see there are some wounded. Colleague Stevic had a minor brain concussion. Stevic? With the system of projectile mission we abruptly cease sleepiness. Maybe you could too, to make blood stream. I am coming back from scouting. Colleague Stevic, your class, IV-2 is in escape. One thing, I didn't give the final grades and today is the last day of classes. This is a complete chaos. Don't you know where they are? Allow me, I don't. One thing, me neither. One thing, allow me, today in our town Red Star is playing. Red Star? Oh come on Stamenic, hit those capital's bastards. What, what, so what if it is Red Star, we are going to give them 3 in the net. Tickets, tickets, tickets, Professor, ticket... Tickets, tickets, give me tickets people! Oh what are you doing? Hey dude stop pushing around! Oh, I am sorry Professor. You weren't hoping for me? - We haven't. - You escaped and I didn't give you the final grades. Ours are pushing the left side, ha? You know everything, just history you don't. We know Professor. Throw away the whistle! Really, Professor. We will see that now. Assistant, who is absent? Professor, here are not Danica Knezevic and Mihailo Jankovic. If I had found you, I will find them as well. There goes his achilles tendon. Achilles tendon is called for... Achilles' heel. And where is that achilles' heel from? Professor, he only knows what achilles's chin is! Well achilles's heel is when someone has flat feet. Oh come on, get out of offside! Professor, really, they catch him there all the time. Fool. That is why ancient Greeks never played football. And who was, in your opinion, Achilles? In my opinion Professor, Achilles was the first hero in mythology that had flat feet... he was a great hero but he had flat feet and that's why they shot him down. Let me tell you one thing, that kind of stupidity I haven't heard in my life Well, I will have to give you a B-. Ok, now, Milena Kokeza, let us hear you now. Hey, have you heard the news? -No, what? -As Tanyug is reporting, I love you. Wonderful girlfriend I have... All the time together we are... I know that she loves me... For her there is only me... But on that evil day... When I was walking alone... Another girl, another passed by... She took my breath away... Come on, let's dance! Ok, fine, but without hands. -Well you can't without hands. She smiled at me, and disappeared... Infinite amount of times I wanted... One more time to meet her... Just one more time to see, that mysterious girl... Looks like there is no hope... Time carries everything... Nonetheless often now, almost every day, I remember her... And I still remember, she had sad eyes... I remember her mysterious smile, she smiled and then disappeared... And I still remember, she had beautiful eyes... I remember her sad look, she smiled and then disappeared... I knew it! I knew that I knew it! What happened? - What do you mean what happened, you see he scratched someone else's Jeep! It's not someone else's, it's the uncle's. Well that's not our Jeep. Is he... Is he bringing her to our home? So what? - What you mean so what? How dares he? Our love will be detected by the seismological society. You're talking nonsense... That's my heart beating for you, I am just the messenger. It's time that from "you", we move to lips. Come down with those stupid jokes. Stupid jokes?! Well let me... You'll wake up the 'rents. Let's talk. You know, as Tanyug is reporting, I love you. Looser, flirting with my jokes. That's the today's youth. Mihailo, did you listen to radio this morning? No I didn't, why now? As Tanyug is reporting, I love you. You are my crazy stone of stumbling.
