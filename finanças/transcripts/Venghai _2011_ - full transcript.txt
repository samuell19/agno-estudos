DHANUSH VENGHAI [Leopard] Sivagangai district TAMANNA RAJKIRAN PRAKASH RAJ MLA has arrived! - Greeting sir! - Greetings! KANJA KARUPPU Collector sir is there - Greeting sir! - Greetings! Sit Please be seated, brother - It's OK sir - Come on! You are our guy! Start right away Paarai kulam village in our Dist, ...need a Railway station As the natives wanted this for them ...and our MLA gave a petition to the higher up It has been sanctioned now Only a few people stood up when I came But everyone stands up when he arrived ...the Railway dept., has decided this Only if you agree to give the land for that ...I could ask for the NOC to the Railway, department We are ready to give our land ...if they provide the Railway, station for us We will decide when to lay the foundation stone! Why are you silent, sir? What necessity is there for a Railway Station there, now? Who did you ask before applying? Mele Kunnakulam's next station after Sivagangai is 18 km far If they have to build one in the middle ...it has to be in Sundarapuram at 9 km away! Why should there be a station at Paaraikulam which is just 3 km away? There is a mill there! ...and 300 people work there! Most of them go in cycles and bikes - That is... true! - MLA is fluttering like this! Are you new to this place? In Sivagangai, he is popular among the people He came differently when he came to seek support! There is a timber shop a manure shop in Mana Madurai ...and a marriage hall in the town So, you are not in politics to make money? - Not that - You can be in any party I will make you the winner if you do any vandalism I'll become very cruel! Not like that! There is a college in Sundarapuram 2 school and 3 factories! 7000 people move about daily It is apt only if we build a railway station there What you say is right Are you trying to shift the railway Station from our place... ...what MLA decided? We won't keep quiet if there is no railway station, for us - Yes, we won't - Why do you talk like this? Is Paaraikulam only your village? Won't you go to nearby village? Don't you ever come to Sivagangai? It has become serious I wonder how to deal with this You can take any legal action I'll take care of the troublesome - What do you say? - You are right Have you decided the amount to build the school in Paavanai? I have asked for the quotes OK. I'll see to that They've put your name in small letters You shameless creature Do you need a mustache? - Beat him with slippers - We left them outside Bring them and beat him See how he looks! Instead of being a slave MLA I could as well do some petty job Why do you throw slippers at my photo? It was you who told us to slipper I told in anger Will you slipper my photo? Will you hack me if I tell in anger? I have been an MLA for 2 years But I could not earn anything That man asks the account for all I have to spend for everything from my kitty The MLA of the nearby area ...bought Audi car in 6 months of his rule! We shall buy it in the next month (Avani) - What? - We will buy in Avani! You don't know the difference between Audi car and Aadi month! I wonder how to manage with you guys Dear! Are you going to setup a Railway Station in Paaraikulam? If you build a station in Sundarapuram I could as well see my sister, often What I wanted is not happening... ...and you are bothered about your choices Go in, bull! Brother! We got 1 million rupees from the mill owner ...telling we are building railway station Leave him No railway station should come anywhere other than Paaraikulam! What should be done? Plant a bomb between Paaraikulam and Sivagangai railway track Write a letter to the Rly. minister, saying that... ...if Sundarapuram has a new Rly stn., we'll plant a bomb in the train! They'll close the file at that There is a bomb blast in the tracks! When does the train arrive?

Police has caught 10 people of us and inquiring them They won't utter a word - Tell me - We don't know anything It was you or your man who did it When he talked in the collector office meeting "that day, he should've been censured None will reach their homes alive ...if you don't tell who is the master mind behind this We are not bold enough to execute All buses from Sivagangai to Melur, Mana Madurai ...Kalaiyar koil to be frisked. - OK boss Check bus stations at Thirumayar, Pudukkottai, Karaikudi ...for the guys coming from Sivagangai - OK sir Dad is doing it in the old fashion! To escape after doing a wrong is old style Now they hide near you and study the situation They will get mixed with others in a short time It is the west side of the Rly. track where they went That means Kattur where they hid! Police is searching the entire Paaraikulam! Police is bothered only about quantity of gun powder in the bomb... The length of the wick... How loud was the blast. Is it a country bomb or land mine? Is it a time bomb or a mobile bomb? Did they throw it from a distance or lit it from a short distance? It'll be evening before we get the answers We have to find them before they get mixed with others Cover the bike with leaves Keep the mobile in silent mode Ring up if you happen to see anyone.

I have sold it to 160 people totally I am not worried about them What about this man?

We need JCP for rent for 6 hours If you don't co-operate JCP will go inside the house A house has to be demolished Be ready with the diesel! It is a new house - But the 'Vaastu' isn't good - What should I do now? The cry of Ramanathan is to be stopped - If not... - JCP is ready... Cut the phone, man Look!

I feel very happy now There is a deity in the temple of the Lord Ganesh! - Go there and offer a coconut - Done! MLA is in the wrong route as you've imagined He is running the Vaigai river quarry contract in proxy name of Muthuswami Only 250 load are to be taken per day They take 450 load instead The entire sand travels to Kerala and Maldives via Tuticorin port We have checked all the check posts - We have our Tahsildar with us - Let them in - Tell me sir - Greetings sir! What's all this? We are helpless before the politicians! Can a government official talk like this? Siva Ganga district is in the upper strata Because of that the Kauvery and Vaigai rivers won't come The entire agriculture has been spoiled The little agriculture of here depends on the little water here If the sand is taken from deep level how will the water come here? Robbing sand from the mother earth ...is equivalent to robbing the womb from the mother Where is Raja Lingam? If we ask him now he would deny all this Because everything is done in a proxy name! If we are a little patient we could catch him red-handed - A message has come here for you - What's it? P for Poriki (Hooligan) E for Erumai(bull) T for Thief E for Enemy - R for Rowdy - Who sent it? Ashok 2nd year - Where is that Ashok? - He is coming running! What message did you send about me? - Vasanth sent me that - Who is Vasanth here? All come here!

It's him who gave the message without any reason He will give it You have to deal with it - Leaving that... - Leave it - Don't you have common sense? - Leave it I'll beat you Not only you even I know how to deal it I'll call sir and tell you If you take my mobile I'll call from a pay phone I'll send a telegram or use pigeon to send the message If the matter has comes out she will be in danger Hence I have not disclosed the matter You are making a mess of it - I'll kill you - Kill me Before I go back I'll make her seek pardon What is this, sir'? The party has complained to the commissioner - I'll kill that professor - Don't do, You'll get arrested! Only then the case file will move from this table to that shelf You can come out on bail in a week! Or else, the commissioner will mark a dot in your case file Arrest me, sir I feel very much worried I haven't slept for a week When he gets the beats for the mistake I did ...I feel very painful I sent message saying "Sorry" 4 times He didn't send a reply I want to see him in person and say sorry fast When you say sorry, say 'thanks' too You told somebody has recommended for your land problem It is none other than Selvam! He told the owner to pay the money right away Poem with the words 'Selvam'! - You look moody! - I am in good mood only! Are you going to tell sorry to Selvam? No! I'm going to tell him yes! - Love? - Yes His approach didn't impress me But his character has impressed me I want to tell him right away He told that he would come only after 6 months I went through the calendar one day That was April 1st, Fools day I thought Selvam will be fooled I didn't expect you to change your mind Peter is coming out of the jail today You don't have to be here Start now - Cowards! - He wouldn't come to me! He will go to the professor only Why did he complain to the commissioner? At least one have been very bold enough! Go and see what is going on in the college Are you trying to maintain the mood ...or have you shit in the dhothi and couldn't move about? You professor! Where are you? Come out, will you? He's coming, brother How dare you complain about me? Will I leave this place if you give com plain about me? Even this college principal wouldn't talk against me!

Listen to me, dear You have humiliated us Our prestige is gone! He wrote 'You are a scoundrel' How dare you write as 'scoundrel'? Don't harm him! My God Shall we give information the police ...as we couldn't do anything to him! Do you want to stop him from hitting? Do you know whom you have hit? In half an hour we will finish you!

You talk little too much when allowed Are you the MLA or me for Sivagangai? I had to answer many people Are they getting money from home to maintain their party? 50 thousand people voted for you believing my words and made you an MLA - How can I answer them? - It has been registered in the record Nothing could be done anymore Dad!

And when will you say your love? The boy is in love with you... Don't try to hurt him unwantedly He is waiting eagerly for you Don't hurt him... It is a puppy love... But a long one I fell in love with you during childhood days There is no caste and matching for the love But the love has developed well itself I really...cried within for your consent What will you say...? And when will you say your love? Don't try to hurt him unwantedly Don't try to hurt him who is waiting eagerly for you Don't hurt him... I was roaming with knife around the village like a wastrel... But your love taught me the shyness I was roaming myself... But your love made me trail you I have changed a lot and I am being good... "because of your amorous look What will you say...?

Put H mark in the middle of the ground! All of you leave the place MLA's car has come I don't know why! All move away - Public dept, Minister Rajalingam - Long live! Are you stunned? Do you wonder how your slave has become a minister? When minister Aalavandan was deprived of his post CM decided to appoint a guy of the same caste in that post He made me the minister as I've won with maximum votes in Tamil Nadu After swearing ceremony got over in Governor's place ...I didn't go to CM for his blessings I came to Madurai by flight ...there, I took the helicopter and alighted in your doorstep You know why? You hit me then without caring me as an MLA I wanted to wipe off that filthy incident from history It is cashew nut which is superior in nuts It is the minister post that is superior in portfolios! I'll show what I can do with that post You got very annoyed when I bought 120 acres I will buy 1200 acres in Tamil Nadu in 6 months What will you do then? When I was MLA for a single seat ...you told that I will be deprived of the seat in 15 days Now I am the minister for the entire seats in Tamil Nadu What can you dare to do? I'll slap you before everyone to avenge for your past deed Finally I'll chop your head off - Minister Rajalingam... - Long live! Sir, Veerapandi's son has come to meet you With how many people? - Alone! - Allow him in I want to talk to you alone Nothing for us to talk Tell what's the matter I've come alone without any fear Why are you scared? Am I scared? Leave me alone with him Speak out Cashew is superior in nuts... ...and Minister post is superior in portfolios Well said You know something When we go to the grocer we buy other supplies in kilos... ...but cashew nuts only in grams They don't use plenty of cashews in the pudding... ...but a few only Very costly! If used in excess it'll harm the health Like wise minister portfolio is not permanent if we press someone else's symbol you will lose your portfolio... ...and stand in the court No one has dared to challenge my dad I saw you challenging him... ...and heard that you will chop off his head It was a bit painful I will give you a month's time If you do as you challenged, my family and I would fall at your feet Or if I don't cut off your head, my dad will fall at your feet What? If you sever my dad's head, my family and I would fall at your feet If I don't cut off your head, my dad will fall at your feet That is... I will surely chop off your head I am a minister now But your dad is still the same man Are you ready for the challenge? I will chop his head off within 30 days Let's see who'll kill whom As my dad said, by-election will come soon in Sivagangai See you Don't get angry Hand bar is bent That's why I hit you Hand bar is bent? Come all of you You disgraced a girl in the main road She is standing there I was repairing the cycle Did I pull her hand like a rogue? Else did I pinch her waist like a scoundrel? - Else did I... - You sinner! What is this? Did I kiss her like this? Or did I try to misbehave with her? Leave me! He is doing like that why do you support him? All of you watching it How can I react? By saying you didn't do, you did all the nasty things before us I think I went overboard Catch him Don't let him go I don't know how to escape from them This is not iron chain but an iron fort All of you sit I think they will scared but they are settling down We anticipated this Hence we're brought it What? Stones Throw at him Even martial arts would get scared of stones What can I do? Why is he smiling at God's statue? Oh God! Hey careful! I was acting April fool Fool! I am going out for an important work But you are fooling me If you get fooled once on April 1st... ...you won't get fooled again the whole day Your work will be successful I am going to meet my lover Pray to God that my love should be successful Don't stare! You will get married Where do you get bride for this? You won't get bride anywhere But it has lot of girl friends in Pandiyapuram What do you mean? It used to go out with the female dogs often One day you will get caught red-handed The day I will beat you to pulp It can understand well Come buddy, why have you come here? I've come to talk to Radhika The examinations are over and summer vacation is on from last week - Tell me Selvam - Where are you, Jayanthi? I am at home Yes, Jayanthi Selvam, called me from Trichy He is on the way to meet you Do you think you are clever? Will the problem get solved, if you escape like this? - Will you please come silently? - Yes Jayanthi and Radhika are on the way to Trichy in 10:30 bus Send me the conductor number - Who is it? - I am Selvam Did two girls board the bus at Madhukapatti? I'll wait near Tirupathur double bridge Ask the girls to get down there He is waiting for you so long Please get down Bus will move only if you get down Sorry, I compelled you to come here You left me and gone to Trichy I realized that you are in confusion Tell whatever in your mind, Radhika I am ready to wait even 6 months for you Unnecessarily you were beaten up to pulp for me That guilty conscience made me lean towards you Finally it made me fall in love You hit them black and blue because of the fuss at college That caused an impact in my mind I got shocked when your father came with a group of guys with sickles When I read the news that you slashed four people... ...and got arrested, really shocked me I could neither accept nor ignore you I concealed my love feeling and living You have silly reasons My dad sent me to Trichy to lead a decent life But I couldn't endure when they disgraced the professor It is horrible if one gets humiliated before his wife That's why I thrashed them If I hadn't slashed those four, they would've killed me Even a small cat fights back to save its life Shouldn't I do what required to save my life? I can't explain these things to mom What can I do for that? You are nice But the place where you stay is not proper I can't get you - I'll accept if you come leaving everything - Everything means? You want me to leave my family, parents, sister... ...relations, friends, and everything? Whom do you want me to leave? I mean your dad... If you talk anything about my dad What do you know about him? People cause violence after getting drunk They would kill others, police will come and inquire The killer will get jailed Their family will be on the streets But my dad will inquire the culprits, advises them... ...unite the families that are affected and give them a happy life! If those carry weapons are cruel then... ...there are good people too who use weapons like some Gods Are they cruel personalities too? It's wrong if cruel use the weapons Not in the case of good men We could sacrifice anything for love You are the only girl asked me to leave my parents for love We should live as a joint family There is no meaning for 2 lovers living alone Your mom is important for you Like wise my dad is important for me I spare you because of the love I had on you If anybody say this, I would've slashed him and throw it in the river I would've considered you if you had told any other reason to avoid me But you used my father as a reason to avoid me I am forgetting you right now I am caught up with... ...a suffering mind My mind is injured ...which is in agony! Love is crying like an infant Heart is in a dilemma for Love Hi friend! Welcome friend, I am waiting for you Why did you transfer me to Sivagangai suddenly? - What's the matter? - A small problem What do you want me to do now?

Where is aunty? She is giving water to calf at the back How long have you been working in this house? Only when you asked me this question I remember that I am a servant here I'll go and meet aunty She went backside She didn't meet your mom and went away from there Don't talk ill about her She left her slippers in the main entrance Go and look at it! A small information They are discussing about a girl who gave information about sir Please be alert Why did you leave your slippers and return in a hurry? Did you go into the kitchen to hurt the old servant... ...or to mix the poison in coffee? Speak out! I'll answer you She entered your house only to kill your father I only sent her there She is lying, isn't it? She is wrong, isn't it? Speak out You are furious because she has poisoned your dad But your dad slashed and killed my son in the road Stop! Catch him How dare you talk against Veerapandi sir? I was urging to kill him from then on I couldn't near him because of his status and power One day I saw you talking to my daughter I decided to use my daughter to kill him I sent her with poison as she was a girl If I had a boy, I would have sent him with a sickle I've been living alone for 11 years Because my daughter shouldn't remember her father I don't know whether my father did the murder or not You could've told any reason and entered into my house to avenge him Did you use my love? You have buried me alive I was listening to you I am not responsible for your hubby's death He didn't take part in election willingly You got 1 million from the ruling party to split our caste peoples' votes - Don't you feel ashamed? - Who told you I got money? Don't yell to hide the truth Withdraw the nomination Else, you will lose your head - Kill Manikavel - He is our guy? Veerapandi will be charged for that. The votes will be split. Everyone believed I was not responsible for the murder Why didn't you believe me? I thought to inform you that my boy has fallen in love with your daughter She said she has informed you and came to my home So I thought, you know about all the truths You have believed someone and poisoned her heart Made her to stand insulted like this She has to lead a life with someone That's what hurt me the most. You didn't betray me alone You have betrayed my whole family Even a prostitute won't act like a lover Look, what he is saying? Keeping a thorn in why have you laughed? You squeezed my neck in the name of love Is this the penalty for thinking we are one? Is this the trial for the God who created me? I've inquired the telephone booth owner There is a ladies college nearby So he couldn't identify clearly A girl is working as a spy Opposite party members are mocking at me in the assembly If I stay calm he will move forward Bring 50 guys from Rameshwaram Inform them to attack Veerapandi and his son in an unexpected moment If the villagers interfere, slash them too Brother, if we do it straight our name will be spoiled Ask our guys to stay out and watch Inform the electricity board office to cut the power in Pandiapuram at exact 10:30 pm Nobody should pick the call in the surrounding police stations Why is he sweating? Is he affectionate with Veerapandi? Inquire who sent him here and find out what way he's connected with Veerapandi - Please talk with her - Don't want You respect our father rig ht? Will he behave like this? He will give respect for the enemy too I have not come here to seek pardon There is no apology for my mistake We are vacating the place It is true that I have poisoned your father Like wise my love is true Please don't insult my love I want to talk with you She believed her mom's words and betrayed you Human should pardon others' mistake My home is like a temple for me My parents are God for me She tried to kill my father. How can I accept her? I understand. She didn't come to propose to you. She asked permission to marry you. Will anyone ask like this just to kill someone? - Promise me she is not in your heart - Yes, she is in my heart But she is not my Radhika who I loved sincerely Dear, just a minute Will you listen to me? Go and bring the girl You said you wouldn't leave the guy alive who came to kill me She too is affectionate with his father Everyone has the guts like Velunachiyar who are born in this land You should be like a good friend, and a warrior You should be an enemy to your enemy. But you shouldn't be a traitor. When I said I was going to cut down the hen, she couldn't take it and cried. That is her real character I was a little angry with her. When a family is vacating its own land They're wounded more We shouldn't hurt them anymore. Go and bring the girl. Did you use my love? A prostitute wouldn't act as lover I shouldn't stay alive. Come, let's go home Dad asked me to bring you back Come, let's go Always taking wrong decisions Why do you kill me? I can't live without you I want to talk to you in person Come soon - Where are you going? - Manickam wanted me to come Take somebody with you He is scared and said to come alone Let me go alone - No, Murugesha! - Sir! Go with him Take 2 sickles with you Hide and sit I have inquired in Muniyandi Vilas shop Murugan Travels Govindaraj only sent him He has many links with Veerapandi - Idiot!

They killed Guruswamy brother I might have killed two of them If anything happens to me, nobody will give you information - That's why I didn't do anything - They will cut the current? Police won't take action, even if we call He is using his power All of you go Go back to your homes and take care of your families Why do you ask us to go back home? Do you want to face them alone? How can we take rest at home leaving you alone?

What has to be done now? Government and law both are in their favor No other way instead of fighting against them There is one way We have to kill only 3 persons to stop those 50 - I can't get you - Rajalingan and his 2 helpers if we kill them, everything will be smooth We have 4 guys That 4 guys enough for them We are youths Even if we die, nobody will suffer because of us But I am sure we will kill them before dying No, this won't work out Don't worry dad!

For what? He had a sickle for 25 years but you didn't cry for him. Why do you cry now? Affection makes you cry? Pray God to get back your son Don't cry unnecessarily, and make me a coward. - Oh God! - Don't cry, mom If you shed tears, I won't endure that If anything happens to you, won't we care? We are not stones to keep silent She has believed you and come here What will I answer her? Answer me What should I do now? I was thinking there is only blood behind each sickle Now I've realized there is a struggle behind that I will wait for you I will pray to God and wait for your arrival You used to say we shouldn't use sickle for our anger If we use for our safety that is not wrong I am not going with anger I am going to save our lives DSP has ordered me to give security till you start When the power is off, call fire station and inform the whole village is in fire Set fire on haystack before the fire engines arrive Police won't come for help, even we call Whoever call the fire service they'll come for help Inform the ladies and children not to stay in the huts - Make them stay in the concrete buildings - I will accompany you I am also unmarried I feel often that I am not yet married Now I've realized there is eligibility to get married I will bite his throat and suck the blood who killed Guruswamy Pandi is not at home They're all staying in the marriage hall We have to plan to separate them as two groups... ...and take them out of the village Time is 10:30 Still we didn't get any information - Who is it? - You go that side Is this place very far from Rameshwaram? - We are ready - This side You go this side, you, that side We have crossed Manamadurai Go that side He is not attending the call Let's reach Pandiyapuram outer and call him They are in the nearby grove Search well Grab him Come on, light the torch Where are you going?
