Let's take a look at him, amigos! - It's Paco. He's wounded. - Damn gringos! Such a brave man! The favorite nephew of Señor Campos. - Poor fella. He was about to marry. - We'll avenge him. - Die, you gringos! - Let's go and avenge him! Die, die! The Mounters did it. We must put an end to that story. - There's nothing we can do for him, right? - Unfortunately not. They planned it all perfectly. It was right here, that he shed his last drop of blood. This time, the Mounters will pay. Bill Mounters, I want to talk to you! Don't shoot! We're unarmed. There's nothing to talk about, Campos! I give you one minute to leave my ranch! No, you must listen. It's important, Bill. For both our families. For our future. Just listen to what he has to say. What does it cost you to talk to him? Our families have been killing each other for years now. I want my nephew Paco to be the last one... - ... to get killed from behind. - How can you talk about peace? There won't be any as long as you consider us intruders. I'd like to make a proposal: Let's have a fair fight on an open field. To the last drop of blood. Like men, not like hyenas. The loser will leave California forever. Who guarantees that you'll stick to this pact? An arbitrator. You may pick him. Alright, Pedro Campos. But everything has to abide to the rules. In the presence of a man of the law. I'm honored by your choice. Even if retired... ... a judge is still a judge. Thus I must appreciate your decision... ... to stop all that treachery and backstabbing once and for all. Rest assured that I will carry out my duties. We have an agreement. Tomorrow morning on the pasture of Alcantara. Wait for me, dad! - What do you want? - I want to come with you. You're not ready yet. Just bring the horses to safety. But I know how to shoot. The Campos' damned blazon. - Yesterday, I hit it 10 times. - Not yesterday. This night, when you dreamt it. Let's go! I'm glad you missed. Young people should stay away from firearms. Don't say that, mother. I can't stand people who talk in clichés. I could talk with this too, as you can see. But I prefer to stay quiet. They deceived us! Take cover! Let's go back, boys! That was a good idea. That should teach the gringos to invade our country. Yes, Rodrigo. Get the work done, my son. The best way to protect oneself from ants is to squash them. Quick! What should we do with these poor devils? We'll send them all to hell. May they be good company to the devils of their kind. No. No. No! Come on with the horses! - Why didn't you kill him? - He's a Mounters. He's a Mounters? Then he's in for a special treatment. Are you sure? Sure. Sheriff! Sheriff! Something terrible happened. A blood bath, a massacre. You must intervene at once and provide justice. Calm down, Your Honor. Don't get upset. Sit down. The Campos did it. I've never seen you in such a messy attire before. And I wanted to borrow your tailor... But sheriff, I told you, the Camposes did it. Easy on the allegations. My son... - Where is Johnny? - Luckily, he's not in danger. He must have stayed with the horses, to protect them. You can't force me to tell a lie. Who's forcing you? I content myself with much less. I'd be happy if you'd share my point of view. But I'm a judge. That's some nice fabric. But who knows what's beneath it? - So you'll think it over? - I can't. I can't do that. I bet you're wearing some very fine underwear. Undress him! I'll make you walk through the village with your bare ass, Your Honor... ... so everybody can see what an honest man is made of. So what am I supposed to say? - Can we be sure? - Absolutely. How did you do that? With just a little psychology. I touched his sore spot. He'd rather die than letting the others know a certain secret of his. - I alone know it. - And what kind of secret is that? He's missing something, you understand? Ever since some Indians got hold of him. You know, he wrongfully convicted one of them. Well, usually they settle for a head of hair, but... But he was bald. I told you we should get rid of him. I'm the sheriff! Isn't it enough that I'm using this star... ... to cover up your dirty deeds? And all that just because of him. I had to pay a high price for this. I finally found you, you murderer! Surrender! Your Honor, I hereby declare that the accused was acting in self-defense. That day changed my life. It was superstition that made me your accomplice. We both could have died back then, but we're alive. And we're bound for life. And inseparable friendship. And precious too. You, Judge Castro, as the only witness of the battle... ... will confirm everything the attending Bill Mounters declared? Or do you stick to your version? - It was a fair fight. - Liar! Stop! You may go. Everyone knows that I'm the victim of an ambush. Bring me the evidence and justice will be done. Don't you talk about justice! You, who succeeded... ... in making a judge swear the untruth! But there will be consequences! I thought I was dead, but actually I was only sleeping. - Are you also an enemy of the Camposes? - No. No. I didn't even know those Camposes. I just can't stop myself from stealing when I'm drunk. What do you think they'll do to us? With you, I don't know. And I don't even want to know. The sheriff will take care of me. There's a bounty of 1,000 dollars on my head. - Good grace. - I know, it's meager. I got old. When I was still young, it was up to 10,000 dollars. Even 12,000, once in Arizona. Back then, money still had value. Twice as much as today, sometimes even three times as much. We prepared a nice little game for you, amigos. Now we'll see which one of you is quicker. No, not like this. That's not right. We have to stick to the rules. Each one of you two has exactly half a life. Let's see what you can do. Let me go and I'll give you twice the bounty. - I'll swear on the Holy Colt. - You'll get away with much less. I'll swear that on your life. - Whatever it may be worth. - Well, little Mounters: You have to reach the gun before the old man does. Kill him and the horse will be yours. An entertaining game. And Lefty will have fun as well. Be careful, boy. It's an even duel. We're the spectators. Impartial. We're unarmed. Well, would you like a sip? Huh? Just a little drop. Drink! 100 dollars on old Lefty. Are you in? Yeah, and twice that much on Johnny. Shoot! It's time to go separate ways. Come with me. My father will give you work. No, there's a rough wind blowing for me around here. And I favor staying in the vertical, preferably warm. And where will you go? There's an old witch down there in Texas. She owns 30 acres, 40 cows and an old hut. - She loves you? - Oh well... ... she likes it when I spank her. - With the hook? - Oh no... With this. But it's not as effective. I bought it when I lost the other hook. God bless you, my boy. And thanks a lot. I'll never forget it. I always give my left hand to everyone. Just to be off the hook if I have to betray them someday. But I want to be sincere with you. Good luck, Lefty. And always remember the advice of someone who grew up... ... by suckling on the barrel of a gun. Shoot earlier if you want to die later. I'll try to stick to that as close as I can. I have no experience, you know. Pray to the Holy Colt. Goodbye! Goodbye. You go to hell, Mounters. The speed of your shot was alright. But your precision was disastrous. You see? You merely grazed it. You are still alive, but it's just like you were dead. - But I... I thought... - No excuses. You're dead, and the one who's dead is always wrong. I'll show you. So much for "no precision". I know you would hit it, but that doesn't matter. You could go to the fairground with that trick. But it requires a little more than that. Leave that to veteran soldiers or retired cowboys. And you came back just to tell me that? Well, I have to do something for you, right? To hell with the old hag and her cows! Let someone else spank her. Don't let it get to your head that you escaped from the Camposes. They were unarmed and your skin was on the line. A true gunslinger has to be as cold-blooded and precise as a banker. First off, the gun has to be fully loaded at all times. There are six lives in there. If one's missing, it might be yours. Make the best of these beans here, but don't be stingy with them. Everyone who's invited to the banquett gets one. Don't use them sparingly. Reload after each shot. Each bullet allows yourself to get older, and makes the others die young. Each bullet you keep is one bullet less in your opponent's body. The Holy Colt... ... has six commandments: Shoot first. Shoot to kill. Keep an eye on the allegedly dead. Beware of spare guns! Never turn your back to another colt! Keep your eye and your hand steady if you want to live long and healthy. Now let's see what you can do. Imagine, I'm one of the Camposes. Come on, shoot. - Shoot! - Never mind, Lefty. Don't act so coy. Now shoot! No, no, no. You didn't get anything. Always remember this, my boy: The Holy Colt is like a swallow. If you grab her too tight, you'll suffocate her. And if you hold her too loose, she'll fly away. Come on, try it again. Let me see something. Not bad, my boy. Now we'll make it a little more difficult. Shoot! You were lucky this time. Grit your teeth and do it. Quicker! Even quicker! I'm in a good mood today. I want to commit suicide. Come on, shoot! Hey Lefty! Lefty... You hit the bullseye, my boy. I like you. You got a soft style. You handle the gun smoothly. I'm sorry, Lefty. It just slipped. I understand your nervousness, your inexperience... The 7th commandment: Always get even. We are now. Who's coming? That's Johnny. He learned how to shoot. Dad! Hello Dad! But he's Left Gun. There's a bounty on him. - He's a bandit. - He's no bandit, he's my best friend. Not the left one. Give him the hook. If it goes on like that, I'll end up digging my grave with that hook. If you want to survive, you'll have to be treacherous. Now you shoot that damned wolf there. That's the initiation test to become one of us. - Now we should get a nice drink, my boy. - I'm an abstainer. If you don't shoot, drink or make love, you're not a man. What's more beautiful in life? You're a gunslinger now. The Camposes made you shoot. Now all you need is whiskey and women. Hey, two whiskeys. Hello sweetie. Who are you? I'm Johnny. And who are you? - Right now, I'm Roselyn. - Right now? - I change my name in each country. - Why? I like to change my clothes, my hairdo and my name. And if you don't like Roselyn, just pick a new one, sweetie. Don't call me "sweetie". Or I'll change your bodily constitution instead of your name. Bravo, sweet... Bravo, Johnny. I'm very attached to my bodily constitution, you know. It made quite a splash in France. - What do you think, Johnny? - I have no experience. But I'm sure Frenchmen have. I trust in that. - We drink to that. Two. - Hey beautiful! The fight's been over for a while. Didn't you notice? And don't you remember that you have to drink with the winner? Do you want to know a secret? I don't like you. Then there's another one who wants to take me on! Watch out, Lefty! You're better than me, even at your age. You will learn it too, Johnny. You still have a whole life of dead folks ahead of you. Why don't you start sweeping them out of your way? If I was 10 years younger, I'd execute them on the spot. And you would come to a bad end! So, which spot are we going for? The heart. But there are too many people around here. It would be better if you execute me in my room. Why are you running around with that old crook Left Gun? It's always a good idea to hang around folks who know more than you know yourself. Don't you feel safe? No, it's better to feel safe together. But you did know how to help yourself when that musclehead provoked you. I just wanted to duck out of having to drink the whiskey you ordered. Not because you ordered it. I never drink, actually. Do you have some sort of disease? There's no such thing as a real man who doesn't drink. So you mustn't complain when I call you "sweetie". My grandpa got 90 years old and had 19 kids. He didn't even drink on festive occasions. You should have tried calling him "sweetie"... I would have liked to meet him, your little grandpa. I bet he could have taught you a lot of things, too. You like me? - What do the others think? - They're enthused. I agree to that. Damn. Why? I think I'm falling in love. With who? Your grandpa... Must be the maternal instincts. Oh please, no. I already have a mom, she's enough. That's not the kind of love I want from you. Do you love me just a little as well? I'm not sure. We'll see. I have to... I still have to gather experiences, you know? Alright now... I got news, boy. We have to leave right away. - I'm sorry. - Me too. So much for gathering experiences. I understand you, but I must. The stagecoach that's on its way here carries something of interest for the Camposes. And now? And now we have to make sure they'll never get it. The weaker they are, the easier it'll be to beat them. - Let's go. - Alone? Not alone. The two of us, our brains, and our guns. Grit your teeth and do it. You'll get over it soon. What's going on? Is this damn trip over already? No, we just added another stop. And you have to buy another ticket. No backtalk! And in cash. Get out! One after another. - You damn bastards! - Father, I'm stunned. This coming from you... Shouldn't the poor benefit from the surplus of goods? You should rather praise me. Hurry up! Careful, Geremia. Take everything I have, but let me live. And your wife as well, right? You'd like that, huh? Step aside, angel face. Come on, raise your arm! A little workout won't do harm. Come on, raise it! - I knew it. - That's my medicine. - That's disgusting! Go away! - Let them kneel down. You heard that? Face on the ground! Exactly. And you two: Get out, and quick! Go to the others! Johnny, take care of the passengers. I'll take care of the luggage. Come on, move! - Raise your little hands, darling! - And how am I supposed to carry my bag? What's in it? That's in it. Kill her! She saw you! You wanted to see my face? Here it is, darling. But this might get expensive for you. First off, give me our little toy. I just missed the mark. And don't you call me "darling". No problem, darling. But swear that you didn't see me and wouldn't recognize me. - I swear it. But do you trust me? - Must be my lack of experience. But I do trust you. But that piece of cloth doesn't suit you. - I prefer you without it. - Are you done talking already? - Found anything? - Nothing. - What are you pray to the saints for? - For you to hit the mark next time. I don't know what was wrong with me. I was nervous. Crooks. Crooks! Nothing but crooks! Here, that's the treasure. Damn it! We took the risk for nothing. Maybe it paid out after all. Holy Mother of God! What kind of day is this? Holy Mary! This area still isn't safe, señorita. A pretty girl on her way home. Like the dust and the jolting weren't bad enough already... ... two bandits showed up as well. You have my word that I will get those bastards. But you must help me to find them. - You have to give me some more clues. - One of them was young. No way, they were two old farts. One of them even had a glass eye. I remember that because my religion teacher in Santa Fé had one as well. - He must be The One-Eyed. - But he's retired. Aw, leave them alone, those poor fellas. They didn't get that much loot anyway. Yeah, right, maybe we should compensate them for that. Excuse me. I'm being foolish. - I'd like to take a rest. - Stop thinking about it, my daughter. Tomorrow night we will celebrate your return. And there's also a nice surprise waiting for you. A very nice one. Come with me. Good night, Giulietta. What are you doing? You only kiss the ladies' hands. Did you see the fire she's got? She won't be easy to handle. I'm not sure if it was a good idea to convince your father to give her to me. I almost regret it. Your father will benefit from it. And you too. We will be bound together, just like our bullets. Now look at what's necessary to save one's skin. Right, sheriff? You think they'll dry faster that way? In your age, you should enjoy yourself. Today would be an opportunity. The Camposes will celebrate tonight. Did they tell you to invite me as well? No. Besides, it won't be a fancy dress party either. And without masks, it would be our funeral. You really think so? We need neither invitations nor masks. My hand can do more than just throw knives, my darlings. It can caress as well, ain't it so? See you later! Ah, Consuelo. Let me console you. Excuse me, honey. Come with me. One moment, friends! Oh, it's time. Just go away. - Silence! - Silence, please! I'm very happy to bring you this important news. Important for the Camposes as well as for their friends. Sheriff Cooper asked me for the hand of my daughter Giulietta. Madam. It's nothing serious, Señor Pedro. She'll be back with you in a minute. - What a sensitive girl. - I didn't tell her. It's the excitement. Hey. Come here. I think this won't be easy. Look at how many people are going to join the festivities. Come, my girl. Come. Alright, it's very exciting, but come... Exciting? You must be joking. I just wanted to get away from that monster. - To you, Father. - Thank you very much. I'm happy to bless your engagement. An excellent choice! Thanks, Father. But I'm not the one who's going to marry my sister. - The sheriff will do that. - What are you saying? - You'll marry the sheriff's sister? - No, I'll marry the sheriff! May I come in? Are you feeling better? Thank you. I'm better. Now. You'll be even prettier... ... when you're wearing a wedding dress. But even prettier... ... as a widow. I was just looking for you, sheriff. May you be blessed. It's a great blessing that a girl that pretty loves you. - A nice surprise... - No offense, sheriff. It's a misunderstanding. I'll take care of it. For your own good. You convinced your father, but not your sister. Now you have to convince me. I don't think it will cause you too much trouble. We're done with the horses. Now we'll take care of the ranch. I'd like to torch it. Then knock yourself out. Grit your teeth and do it. - I heard a shot. - Must have been a gun salute. That's true, Francisco. These damned gringos must understand... ... that we're still the rulers of California. The Campos won't give up that easily. They stole the horses! They stole the horses! - Damn it! - It must have been the Mounters. - They can't be far. - How is that possible, with all those people? Who did it? - Who do you think? The gringos. - They shall teach them a lesson! What are you waiting for? Don't you know if you should turn me in dead or alive? Or are you afraid to send me to hell? I don't think I would end up in the purgatorial fire. If it's an angel who kills you, you go straight to Paradise. Don't you think? Come on, shoot. I can't. This way! No, it's my nanny. But he's a Mounters. - Go back to your room, at once! - Help him. Come with me. I love you. Good riddance... When I saw that the Camposes' ranch wasn't burning... ... I said to myself that all of a sudden... ... Johnny got older than I am. - Older than you? - Yes. - Dead. - You weren't too wrong about that. You went to see the little missus from the stagecoach, right? You knew she was a Campos. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to keep you alive for a few hours. That's enough, boy! Become a man! You're right. I'll talk straight with my father. Well done! You miraculously saved yourself from your enemies. And now you want to get killed by him? One more. - One more? - Oh please. Now it's too many. I do pay them, right? But that's the last one. A bottle. Aw, one's not enough for my thirst. You'll get drunk if you don't stop. - I'm an abstainer. - But if only the gun drinks, you won't forget. What a shame. There's no blood of the Camposes being bottled here. Who are you trying to forget? Can I help you? You know what? Shoot me too! Ever since you left me I'm full of whiskey, right up to the eyes. Just a guy we wanted to see... Well... My dear ladies. After all the physical training we need some vitalization for the mind. The soul needs to be fed, too. And in here, you'll find a heavenly diet. - Hey. - You're talking to me? What do you want, Father? You too are on a quest for peace, my boy. But I know that you won't find your peace in here. And where is it? Oh yes! You'll find it inside the old mine where a sister in faith awaits you. And God may be with you. I love you, Giulietta. I love you. They can see us out here. Let's go into the shed. We're close to the horses there. Kill me! There's no future for our love. There's no life for it anymore. - Come on, what are you waiting for? - Are you gone insane? You just wanted to see me to tell me all this nonsense? I love you. But our love will be without hope. It's better to die. But by your hand. Only those who have never been wounded... ... can laugh about somebody who still carries their scars. That's why I understand you. But our love can and must live. Why are you a Mounters? Deny your father. Abandon your name. Only your name is my enemy. It's a thing of no importance. For a name that doesn't belong to you - ... because you're not like them - ... you'll have me, for ever and ever. I can't. I was wrong. You're just like them. You too are a murderer! Am I still a murderer? Yes. The sweetest of them all. But as long as you keep killing... ... our love will be in danger. I don't want her to die. You must stop killing, Johnny. Will you promise me that? It's not that easy. Swear that you will stop killing. Swear on our love. I promise. Oh darling, but I don't want them to be able to kill you. If they found out, they would do it. That's why we have to escape now, my darling. Why did you make me come here? Because I'm a jolly little lady, and I get sad if I'm all alone. - No, let me go. - What's wrong? Why are you acting coy? As usual, you men don't understand anything. - Well, I thought you like it. - You're so full of yourself. Listen to me. What do you want? Talk. I'm such an unlucky devil that I fell in love with little Johnny. But he's got the hots for... ... you know who? Can't you tell? You ever read Shakespeare? With Juliet... or Giulietta. What are you saying? You heard me right. Repeat this name. Shakespeare or Johnny Romeo? I put a snake in your heart, right? Tell me what you saw if you don't want me to kill you! Oh, and who will provide you with information then? I could tell all of this to the old man. But that would be too easy. It wouldn't be no fun at all. The first time, I let him get away. Because too many people were present. Too many dogs around the bone. But now I will play with the little fella... ... alone! Hey! Hey! Did you leave the house without your gun today? What are you carrying in that gun belt? A toy? Why don't we play with it together? Are you afraid? Are you afraid I'll steal it, little one? What are you waiting for, boy? - Why don't you just shoot? - Get out of my way, old man! I swore I'd stop killing. Did I teach you how to defend yourself, or how to get yourself killed? Take a hike, old man! Keep out of this! I will shoot! Forgive me, my friend. Murderer! Arrest him! Who's there? No, don't shoot. I'm not armed, as you can see. I have a big supply of fire-water. It's a little cold in here. This will keep us warm. Tell me, did you mistake the prison for a branch office of the saloon? - Why did you come here? - Executions disturb me. But as long as he's alive I can obtain the satisfaction... ... of spitting everything in his face what he deserves. Wow, this stuff is pretty neat. Did you know that this walking corpse here... ... preferred one to me whose only female attribute is her name in the family book? Drink, my friend. And now give me a hug. Tighter. Learn how to behave like a man! You see, they're all lying to my feet. And there they will stay. But if someone doesn't want to, he's free to go. I'm not holding anyone back. Get lost! Go! Run! Go! Fast! Freeze! Freeze! Johnny Mounters escaped! Johnny Mounters escaped! Rest in peace, Rodrigo Campos. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. Hallowed be the name of the Lord. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Rest in peace, amen. And this should have been a happy day... - Now we have to reschedule your wedding. - Yes, to tomorrow. Tomorrow? It's not necessary to wait. In the hour of this tragedy... ... I can feel that Rod wants me to stay with his sister. Forever, that is. That was his wish during his lifetime. Now that he's dead, I feel even more compelled to fulfill this obligation. Yes, you're right. Let's go, Giulietta. Leave her here. She needs a moment of silent prayer. I didn't want this. You have to believe me. Even if it wasn't the truth, I'd still believe you. I have no home anymore. - I have no name anymore. - You have my name. And you will come with me. Tomorrow at dawn on the Hills of Death. - And Johnny? - Couldn't find him. But neither the sheriff nor the Camposes will hunt him down. It seems like they wanted to celebrate a wedding. And we'll turn it into a funeral. - Try to find out more about it. - Come on. What's going to happen, Bill? I'm scared. Stop! If you don't want to stop forever! - What do you want? - To spoil your party. For you and your clan. - Who are you? - Steve Mounters. - Down! Down! - No! - Let me go! Let me go! - Don't be so mulish! You really are a true Campos. No! - Get on the horse! - No! - Come on! - No! Let me go! Let me go! No! Don't stir any more hate! Let me go! You don't know what you're doing! I'm here, sheriff. Turn around, slowly. You're not worthy of the star you're wearing. I can't accept you as a sheriff anymore. Come on, let's bring her back home. Let her father worry about her. But he'll have to pay a high price to get you back. Let's go! No! No! Sara, where's Giulietta? Why didn't she come to me? - Was she afraid to go? - But no. She left. Don't move, Mounters. Or you're a dead man. Do you, Johnny Mounters... Come on! Do you, Johnny Mounters... ... son of Bill Mounters... ... on this happy day... ... take as your lawful wife... ... Giulietta Campos, here not present? No, because I will kill you! Johnny! Johnny, my darling! Giulietta! A wedding could be the best way... ... to finally make peace between our families. Don't you think? But what we like even better... ... are funerals! Give up! Never! Never! There couldn't be... ... another way. This is the day of a black peace. Whoever calls Death will be answered by Death. And he has only one answer... ... for all of them. The rest... ... is silence.
