(bright instrumental music) - Handkerchief. Pruning shears, Alfred. - Yes, my lord. Here's a lovely rose. - Yes, it is, isn't it? You're quite right, it is lovely. I'll have it. - [Alfred] I think it's going to shower. - Nonsense, just a cloud, it's going to pass. (drum roll) (dramatic instrumental music) (bishop speaking foreign language) (woman sobs) - Don't you touch me! (dramatic instrumental music) (woman sobs) - Don't let him see you like this. You're only adding fuel to his fire. Now get control of yourself. - Why did it have to be him? The only decent man left. God, I would've given my life to save his. (sobs) - I know. There must be a way, we must find a way. Look at him, standing up there with that sick smile on his face. - I can't bear to look at him. It's all I can do to keep from spitting in his face. - Shh, he's coming. You must get control of yourself. - What a pity, in the bloom of his manhood. Like the roses he so dearly loved, cut down before his time. Oh well (speaking foreign language). I know how much our dear brother meant to you, Lady Jane. - You hated him, now you've killed him. - Hate is a strong word, my dear sister. - You hated him! You killed him! - Don't you ever do that again! - Let go! You're hurting me! Get off! - Stop it, stop it, stop it! The whole court is watching! Don't let them see you this way. My God, the priest is coming. - Is something wrong? Is Lady Jane well? There is something wrong, what is it, my lady? - It's nothing, Father. - She had a fainting spell. - But she'll be all right now, won't you, dear? May I offer you my horse? - I'd rather walk. - Why must you always antagonize him? Don't you know it doesn't do any good? Why won't you listen to me? - We must dispose of him. - Are you out of your mind? - Can't you see, there's no other way. - Yes, my lord. - And you're very comfortable, aren't you? I see to that, don't I? - Yes, my lord. - You're a very rich little humpback because of me, aren't you, lvan? - Yes, my lord. - Yeah, you wouldn't want anything to happen to that hump, would you? - No, my lord. - Very well then. You do as I say. - It was only yesterday that he gave me this ring. It's beautiful, isn't it? My last remembrance of him. I loved him so much. - Shh, you mustn't, he's dead. - I can say it now, I loved him. You knew that, didn't you? - You shouldn't speak of such things. It's abnormal for a brother and sister... - To love? It went further than that. - What do you mean? - You promise not to tell? - I swear by the holy mother. - I'm going to have his baby. - Your own brother? You can't mean it! - I loved him. - Stop, I don't want to hear anymore. - I'll take revenge. Revenge shall be my constant companion. Revenge will rise with me. Revenge will sleep with me. From now on, revenge is my lover. - Who's next in line? - Albert, Duke of Aberthy. - And what of the Duke of Norwich? - He must be last in line. - Because of his brother? - Precisely. - But Albert's an idiot, how can he rule the kingdom? - He must rule, there is no other way. - Who shall rule until then? - We have no other choice but the Duke of Norwich. - Then we're all agreed? Peter? - Yes. - Peter? - Yes. - And I, too, agree. Then it's settled. I'm sure the duke will be satisfied with our decision. And now to other business. The walls of Taragon have been (speaker cut off). - Sire. - [Sire] Yes, lvan, what is it? - The Duke of Norwich wishes to address the council. May he have your permission? - [Sire] By all means. The duke is always welcome in the council chamber. - Oh, thank you, sire! - Peter, Peter, Peter, I thought I might be of help. - Your help is always welcome. As you know, your brother must beget an heir. - My half-brother. - 1 do not wish to bring up the subject. - I'm afraid it's a subject that cannot be ignored. I realize that being spawned by my father's mistress, I shall be last in line to rule the kingdom. - Hush, you mustn't. - Oh, but I must! Truth is like a sunflower. It must thrive in the sun, not in darkness. Only the deadly nightshade thrives in darkness. - A beautiful thought, my lord. - Hear, hear. - It is. - To business. - By all means. - Well, as it stands, Albert is the last male left in our family, and if Albert were to father a son, then our kingdom would be set back on its rightful course, set by our grandparents. - It is too bad you cannot rule instead. As it is, Albert will rule in name only. - If the kingdom knew they were ruled by a half-wit. - Oh, but they shan't! We will see to that, won't we? I mean, it's the council that rules the kingdom, not the person on the throne. - Not always. - That's true. Now, let's see. Yes, Albert is next in line. And then Lady Agatha of Mildoon, and, last, Lady Jane of Darwick. - Haven't you forgotten something, my lord? - What's that? - You, my lord. You shall be ruler last. - But only last. - If Albert begets a son, he will be the only true male heir to the kingdom. If he should die, his bride will rule. - May I, sire? - May you what? - Well, I was just noticing Lord Harking's candle. Since you no longer have use of it, I was wondering if I might have it. - A simple request, take it. (dramatic instrumental music) - Such a beautiful, deep blood red. It will go well on my mantle. Thank you, sire. Onh, by the by, there's one other matter I wish to clear up. - What's that, my lord? - Albert's bride. - Yes, of course. But we'd forgotten. - The kingdom is poor, the plague has left few, and the few that are left are spotted with blight, and when a kingdom relies on a healthy heir, it must be conceived of a healthy mother. - Albert is the kingdom's last chance for survival. If he does not conceive a male heir, the kingdom is lost. If it were not for your sterility, you as half-heir could continue the blood lineage. - My sterility leaves only one hope, stupid, idiotic Albert. - Who shall be his bride? - We shall secret ballot. - Remember, gentlemen, she must be fertile, healthy, beautiful, and, above all, untouched by the plague. Write your ballots, time grows short. (suspenseful instrumental music) - It ils unanimous. - Of course. - Heather MacGregor. (dramatic instrumental music) - [Man] Morning, William. (light instrumental music) - Are you happy, Heather? - Oh, yes, William. William, my sweet William. (romantic instrumental music) Are you happy, William? - What's happiness? Let's see now. Happiness begins with H, has blue eyes, lives with its father, and I'm madly in love with it. Can you guess what it is? - Mm hmm. I love you. You know that, don't you, William? (romantic instrumental music) - [Man] Heather! - Oh, it's Father! We've got to go. - Will I see you tonight? - At eight? - In the chapel. - [Heather] Maybe. - The decision was made two days ago. There's nothing that can be done about it. - Why didn't you tell me? Father, how could you? - He had no choice in the matter. Your father had to accept the 30 pieces of gold. - And my feeling don't matter? My love for William doesn't count? - Heather, listen to me, I only want your happiness. There was nothing we could do. - Then it's settled. - Ah, it won't be so bad, my dear. Lots of good things to eat, a warm bed, servants, beautiful clothes to wear. It won't be so bad. - What's he like? - Who? - My intended. - He'll be whatever you wish him to be with a love like yours. - That's no answer. - In this life, we make our own answers, my dear. Ooh, it's after sunset, I must be going. Be kind to your father, my dear. He had no choice in the matter. - Let me get you something to eat. - I'm not hungry. - But you must eat something. - Just let me alone, Father! - [Father] Heather, Heather! Heather! (suspenseful instrumental music) - Heather, are you all right, is there something wrong? - I don't know what to do. - What's wrong? - They've arranged for me to marry Albert, Duke of Aberthy. - [Man] Don't you want to? - I don't even know him. How can I marry someone I don't even know? - It might not be so bad. - How do you know? - I know a lot more than you'll give me credit for. I know it's warm in the castle. You'll have beautiful clothes, never go hungry, and you'll be a lady. It's not so bad. - Sounds so easy the way you put it. - Anything is easy if you put your mind to it. Even death. - I don't wanna talk about it. Would you mind terribly, Marvin, if I asked you to leave? I'd like to be alone. Please.

I couldn't bear to see you that way. - Well, I am happy. You don't know how happy you've made me. It'll all work out, you'll see. - You better hurry now. There's a full moon, you'll be able to see way better. Now, remember, when you get to the other side of the river, Cousin Janey will be waiting. - What about you, what will they say? - Now, don't worry about me. I'll tell them you ran away and there's nothing I can do. Now, go on. - I don't wanna leave you. - Now, go on. - Bye, Father. (knocking) -Who is it? - [William] Heather? - It's William. - May I come in? - It's very late, William. - We had a date, did you forget? - No, I didn't forget. I just changed my mind, that's all. - I don't understand. - Father, may William and I be alone, please? - [Father] Of course, my dear. - There's something I have to tell you. I don't know how to begin. - Why not the beginning? That's a good place to start. - Well, I don't love you anymore. - Why the sudden change? - It's not so sudden. I've been thinking about it for a long time. - Well, then look me in the eye and tell me you don't love me. - No, I don't like being touched. - You're lying, look at me. - Why don't you go? You're not wanted here. - Tell me the truth. - L am. - You're not. - I think you'd better go. - Tell me. - Please, William. - Heather. - Oh my God! I can't go through with this. I tried to destroy your love for me because. - I don't wanna hear about it now. You can tell me all about it later. Come on. Why didn't you tell me before? - 1 don't know, I couldn't I guess. - I thought you knew me better than that. I thought you trusted me. - Maybe I could just go away. That way, I wouldn't be a burden on anyone. - Shh! I've got to think. Wait, I've got it. - What? - We'll leave tonight. - But you can't. What about your mother, who'll take care of her? It's not fair. - Margaret can look after my mother. - William, I love you. (romantic instrumental music) - We better hurry. There'll be a full moon tonight. It'll be easy traveling. I want you to take only what you need. We can't be burdened, you understand? I'll meet you back here in one hour. I love you. - We'll be together tonight. - As one. - My love. - Go.

(light instrumental music) - [Lady] Are you all right, my dear? - Oh, it'll pass, it's just the sun. I guess I'm just not used to all this attention. - Well, you'll have to get used to it, my dear. As the wife of the ruler of our kingdom, you will have to spend much time in the public eye, and when your son is born, there'll be... - You're going much too fast for her, Norman. Can't you see she's ill at ease? - [Norman] Close your mouth, Agatha. - I won't be spoken to in that tone. - [Norman] I'm in charge here, and I shall speak to you in any tone I choose. - Oh, what a lovely flower. Exquisite! We must name it! Too bad it isn't yellow or it could bear your name, dear brother. - If it were blood red, it would bear your name. - Does my eye deceive me oris it time for lunch? My stomach tells me that it is. Oh, see, there it goes again. My stomach is never wrong. - [Peter] Your stomach asks for too much and you pamper it so. - Nonsense, I'm hungry. Hadn't we better... - In a minute, sire. We must give this young lady proper time to survey her future kingdom. After all, two days hence and she shall be ruler of all this. Where's Albert? - I last saw him standing inside the greenhouse. I don't see him now. Have you seen him, Lady Jane? - I'll look for him. - I would show you my favorite, my dear. It has such a sweet smell, exquisite. One would never think that the leaves of that beautiful plant were used for thousands of years as a deadly poison. Unfortunately, it is not in bloom at the moment. Have you ever seen the deadly nightshade, my dear? - No, my lord. - Ah, such beautiful eyes you have. You're a flower, of course you are. You're Heather, lovely lavender Heather. Oh, don't blush. Well, look, Lady Agatha, she blushes. Isn't that sweet? (light instrumental music) - Albert, stop that! - No, no. - Open your mouth! - No, no. - Open your mouth! - No. - Open it! How many times have we told you not to eat bugs? Now you must go to bed without your supper. - I want supper, I want that! - Look at you. What are we going to do with you? Now, I want you to listen carefully. Albert, you must behave! I'm going to take you into the greenhouse, and I only want you to say two words. Do you understand? - No. - Albert. - Two words? - I want you to say them to her. - To her? - You just say "my dear," and you put your hand out, like this. Say the two words. - My dear. - Dear. Say it again. - My dear. - Again. - My dear. - That's enough. Oh, look at you! You're worse than a child. - My dear, my dear. - What a mess. - My dear. - Now come with me. - My dear. - As the duke has told you, the kingdom is rather poor just now. But we expect, in due time, to change the course of all that. - And the plague has wiped out most of the animals and the pestilence most of the crops. - But we shall rebuild and procreate a new kingdom with your help, Heather, my dear. - Shut up, you must not worry this little one. She is far too fragile to bear our burdens. We will make no more excuses for the appearance of our surroundings. Now, we must talk of lighter things! Of course, the wedding. - [Sire] Oh, yes, yes, the wedding. - You shall have the most beautiful wedding ever conceived for a bride. The pearls are from India. - All the flowers from the northern part of our country are collected for your wedding feast. - Flowers are so beautiful, my dear. I myself helped to pick them out. - But here is your intended. Albert, my dear brother, you must walk your bride. _My dear. - Now [ think it's a good time to go for lunch. (light instrumental music) (lvan whimpers) (lvan screams) - The knife, quick, the knife! (lvan whimpers) - You must burn it first to make it sterile! - There's no timel! Suck it, suck it, suck it! - Yes, sir. (dramatic instrumental music) - My God, my God, my God! - We've got to get her out of here. He's going to have another one of his fits. - Let her see it. I hope it Kills him this time. (Norman groans and moans) (Norman screams) (humming) - Leave off. - Yes, my lady. - We must have a talk with you. We know it's not the most opportune time, but we must warn you. - Warn me about what? - The duke. - The duke? - He'll do anything to have his own way. - Ever since he was a child, he's been devious, false, and treacherous. He'll do anything to get his own way. - [Heather] Why haven't you told me this before? - We were afraid you'd run away, so we waited until the last wedding preparations were made. - [Heather] I feel so helpless. - We'll always be here. Just confide in us, and we'll help you. - Thank you, I needed someone to say that so much. - Always be wary of him, never trust him. Always think the worst, and you'll survive. - But he's always been so nice to me. - Don't you listen, girl? - But I can't believe he... - Come with me! (groaning) (moaning) Look, look at them. - It's horrible! - Look at them! Each one of them has crossed the duke. Look at this one. He was my servant. He came to warn me. He has no tongue. (Heather wails) He gets liquid but no food for 70 days. (moaning) There was nothing I could do. This is Lady Agatha's servant, what's left of him. His legs were chopped off, but he's kept alive to be bled daily. Follow. Oh, but there are more, my dear. He has a whole dungeon full of enemies. This one here. (Heather gasps) - I don't wanna see anymore! Get me out of here, please! No! I want to leave! (dramatic instrumental music) Let me out! (moaning) (laughing) (moaning) - Oh, dear. (moaning) (dramatic instrumental music) Someone will come. Just you wait and see! (moaning) We'll all get even, won't we, my dear? Don't look at me that way. I can't bear this. (groaning) What's that you say? What? (moaning) Oh, yes. It won't be long now. I'll do to him what he's done to you. The world will find out. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Onh, hail, Mary, full of grace. Blessed art thou. Damn him! Damn him! (moaning) Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! Revenge! - Norman. What are you doing here? - Oh, I beg your pardon, my lady. - What are you doing in the duke's bedroom? - I might ask the same of you. - Where's Norman? - He's right in there. - 1 don't believe you. - Oh, come now, Rosemary, don't be naive. You're too early to pull that little girl game. - I don't like the tone of your voice. - Well, I don't like you being here. - I have more right to be in here than you! - We'll see about that. Sex makes me hungry. - 1 don't believe you. - Ask him. - I shall! Now get out of here, you dirty little bastard! - Be careful, my dear, your breeding and background are showing. It's not very pretty. (fleshy smacks) Oh, shall we go another round? - [Rosemary] Stop it, you're hurting me! - I'd like to break your neck. - Not if I break you first. - IIs that a threat? - Take it any way you like it. - I usually do. - You have a filthy, dirty mind to go along with your filthy, dirty body. - Too bad you can't satisfy him. - You bastard! (dramatic instrumental music) - [lvan] Stop it, stop it! Master, she said that I... - That's a lie, he's lying. - That's enough out of both of you. Lvan, I think you'd better leave. - [lvan] But, my lord, she said that I... - I said to leave. - Very well, master. - For Christ's sake, don't start those. You know I can't stand tears, especially yours. - What was he doing here? - What did it look like? - I can't share you with anyone else. - You could if you tried. You told me your mind rules your life, not your heart. That was our whole arrangement, remember? - That was before I fell so deeply in love. - That's your misfortune, my dear. I could very easily love you, but I won't let myself. You see, that's where you and I differ, my dear. I have a very strong mind, a very strong willpower. Oh, I can turn my love into hatred or the other way around. All my life, I've never been able to love. I take that back. I do love one thing, power. Power. - Your thoughts cut through me like cold steel. It frightens me sometimes how much we think alike. - Why do you think I chose you above all the others? - What about Ivan? - (chuckles) lvan? Let me explain something to you, my dear. I live for pleasure. Only second to power, of course. And I'll try anything. I'm not a homosexual, I'm not a heterosexual, I'm not asexual, I'm try-sexual. Yes, that's it, I'll try anything for pleasure. - Do you enjoy it? - I enjoy the moment. - And right now? - And right now? The moment is you. (jagged instrumental music) (soft instrumental music) - My lady. The marriage counselor is here. - [Heather] I beg your pardon? - The marriage counselor. - I don't understand. - It's usual that the marriage counselor gives comfort and aid to the bride. - [Heather] Why have I never heard of such a thing? - Because of past, unfortunate experiences... - [Heather] Must I? - It's the law, my lady. - Very well. - Oh, my, you're beautiful! Aren't you just gorgeous? Oh, exquisite silk, my dear. I've never seen such silk in my life. How much did it cost? - Why, I have no idea. - Well, it must've cost a pretty penny. We can't afford it. The kingdom's not been rich, you know. As a matter of fact, the Peters haven't paid me yet for my last year's service. Then they spend my salary on a wedding dress for you. Do you think that's very nice? - [Heather] I'm not feeling very well. - Well, to business. Where did I put that book? It's around here somewhere. I had it when I came in. Ah! Come out, come out wherever you are! That book's always getting lost. I don't think it likes me. Hello, Bookie, there you are. Now, you bad book! I bet you think I'm silly, don't you? But I always name everything I've got something. This one is Bookie. My, you are beautiful, aren't you? The last bride we had? Well, we mustn't go into that. Now, your age. -19. - Sex? I'm on the wrong page. Ah, age 19. Next question, last name? - MacGregor. - MacGregor. Heather MacGregor. It lilts, doesn't it? J Heather MacGregor 7 J Heather MacGregor 7 Are you all right? - I'm not feeling very well. - Just nerves. Wait until the wedding chamber. You'll get over it. - May we please get on with it, my lady? - Just call me Magda, everybody does. - Very well, Magda. - Magda, that's a nice name. I never liked that name before. J Magda J J Magda J - Please. - Virgin? You don't have to answer that. Ink. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, well, I know ways we can fix that up. I know a good chemist who will fix you up in a jiffy. Parents? - Just my father. - Lineage? - I think Scotch Irish. - Don't you know? - I was adopted by my father when I was just an infant. - Let's begat it, Scotch Irish. I won't tell if you don't. Now, this is the part I really like. I want you to be honest with me. Remember, this is your friend Magda. Think of me as your Ma. Better still, think of me as your sister. Now, have you ever been intimate with men? Okay, they'll never know. No. Now, did your father ever explain to you about the birds and the bees and the flowers and the barks of the trees. - Please, Magda. - Of course, my deair, how thoughtless of me. You see, I'll stop. Next question, explain to the bride intimate consummation of marriage. Thank God that's over! Now, give me your hands. This is the intimate part. Don't worry, it'll be over before you know it. Now, it is customary for the bride to take the Bible from the bedside table, lift it gently in her lily white hands, and carry it, both palms upward, to her future husband, the man who is to deflower her, and raise it to his lips to be kissed. He shall then take it from her. They shall both stand for a moment. She shall pull the string that binds her gown. It's this one. She shall let fall her arms, the robe shall drop from her shoulders. You see, they put lead weights in hems. The bride shall then say, "l am yours. "Do with me as you so desire. "l am yours forever and ever, amen." Then the sign of the cross. He shall then disrobe. They shall be part, walk to the marriage bed, one on each side, doesn't matter which. Then they shall both hop in. Then you take your hand, make sure that it's your right hand, under the covers, then you (speaker cut off by knocking). Oh, poo! We hadn't finished yet! - That will be all, Magda. - Yes, my lord. Don't worry about a thing, dear. It's been going on for centuries. - I hope Magda hasn't frightened you, my dear. She can be quite alarming at times. There's more method in her madness than meets the eye. You know, lvan, I really don't like Magda. Why don't we put her on my list? (chuckling) Ah, would you walk to the window and back for me? My eyes haven't had such a treat in years. (soft instrumental music) You are exquisite. You arouse in me a fire I didn't think possible. I have all I can do to keep my hand from you. I'm sorry, I wish I had two hands. My one arm has more strength in it than any men in the kingdom. - Isn't it about time to go? - Time? What is time? It cannot be controlled. It dominates us like lice on the back of a mangy dog. We must jump through its hoops like some gypsy beggar traveling in a shoddy carnival. I hate time! Time is evil! Time is spent. It must be destroyed! - Master, master, it is the wedding day! (tense instrumental music) We must be happy. The day is happiness. See the pretty bride? Isn't she lovely? Oh, master, please, be happy. Be happy, master. Master, please, be happy, master. Master, please, be happy. Be happy, master. Please, be happy. Please, be happy. (tense instrumental music) - Albert! Albert, your bride. May God take care of you both. Let it begin! (triumphant instrumental music) - Heather MacGregor, Albert, Duke of Aberthy, I now pronounce you man and wife. (bells ring) You may kiss the bride, my lord. You may kiss the bride now, my lord. - [Norman] Kiss her! For Christ's sake! (triumphant instrumental music) - I'm so happy. (bells ring) (quiet instrumental music) - Isn't it time for bed, my love? My lord? Albert! It's time for bed. Please? - No, you go to bed! - I can't go to bed by myself. - Me hungry. Food good. Wine good. Good. (knocking) -Who is it? - [Norman] The Duke of Norwich. - Just a moment. (quiet instrumental music) - [Norman] May I come in? - Is this usual? - In this circumstance, yes. - Very well. - As you have since discovered Albert is not of sound mind, his body is. You see, my unfortunate half-brother was pushed, or fell, on his head at the age of six under mysterious circumstances. It is necessary for you and he to consummate the marriage. It is necessary that we have an heir. But it is not necessary for me to explain all this. - But what am I to do? - I shall have to direct the proceedings. - That is impossible. - You have no choice, my dear. - And if I refuse? - You have no choice, my dear. We must proceed. Soon, the cock shall crow. First, the ceremony. Stand up! Proceed. - I am yours. Do with me as thou so desires. I am yours forever and ever. Amen. I cannot go on. - Stay there! - But I cannot, my lord. - I'll turn my back. (gentle instrumental music) Now to the bed. Albert! Now, pick up the covers. Now, get into bed. I rely on you, my dear, to direct the consummation. It's a shame that a flower such as you must be plucked by an idiot. (Norman whispers) (Albert chuckles) Pleasant dreams, my dears. (dark instrumental music) - [Albert] Fuck! (Albert laughing) (quiet instrumental music) (knocking) -Who is it? - [lvan] It's Ivan. - What is it? - Come with me. We have no time to lose. (quiet instrumental music) (Albert snores) (swirling, dramatic instrumental music) (Albert gags) - There is a French expression for it. It's called menage a trois. Surely you're familiar with it, lvan. - [lvan] But I don't wanna do it, my lord. I don't like Rosemary. Why can't it be like it was? - Because I don't like it like it was. I've lost interest. I don't like it like it was. Do you understand? - No, my lord. (lvan grunts) - Now do you understand? - Yes, my lord. (knocking) - [Norman] It's Rosemary, let her in. - Yes, my lord. - What's he doing here? - You, lvan, and I are going to have a little party. Lvan, get Rosemary a drink. - What are you up to, Norman? - Well, I told you, we're all going to get to know each other better. I mean, I can't have my two favorite friends not getting along. You're first, Ivan. - First, I don't understand, my lord. - Well, I want you to tell Rosemary all about yourself. Go on. Talk, damn you! - I don't know what to say, my lord. - Arouse her compassion. Tell her how you became a humpback, a degenerate, a liar, and a cheat. There are so many words that fit you. - [lvan] Please, my lord! - It's all right, lvan. Don't you realize I love you for those things? I mean, I see beauty only in decadence, for only decadence is the mother of invention. Start! - I came from my poor family. My father left three weeks after I was born. Mother and I had no food. I used to have to go to the market late at night and pick up all the rotten fruits and vegetables that were left. Mother hated me. She didn't want me. I was six years old. Then Mother had a wonderful idea. She thought of all the money she could make if I was a beggar, but I didn't look like a beggar. So she got two of her men friends, she had many men friends, she locked us in a room. They seduced me, perverted me, used me, destroyed me. They put me over a tabletop on my back. They stood over me, and then they jumped, one on my hips, the other on my shoulders. My young back broke like brittle. Many months later, I became a beautiful beggar. Mother was happy, I was miserable. Then you came into my life, Norman. All the pain that I was accustomed to is like pleasure when followed by reward. I thank you, I thank you, my lord. - Isn't that sweet? It's your turn, my dear. - I can't. - Oh, there's no such word as can't. Won't, maybe, but not can't. Talk. - 1, too, came from a poor background. I never had a family. I lived with an aunt. She had all she could do to support herself. I was overprotected in some ways, but, in other ways, my judgment of people was corrupted. Religion was forced on me day and night until I couldn't stand it. When I was 12, she couldn't work anymore. When I was 14, we were desperate for money, so she sold me to your court. I never saw her again. I started out in the kitchen, barefoot and dirty, as a scullery maid. When there were banquets, I had the scraps from the table. At other times, I had potato peels, and the vegetable tops, and the drippings from the roast. When I was 16, Lady Agatha saw me, took compassion on me, tutored me. I became a chambermaid. One year later, I became a servant. That was the day you walked in on me, my bath. It was a very hot day. You were very charming then. I've never had another man since then. - [Norman] Until today. - Today? - It's about time my little girl graduated. It's time she grew up. I want to share my pleasures, my loves. The three of us shall be one big, happy family. No innermost secrets, just we're the most menage a trois. (chuckles) I like that word. Disrobe, lvan. - Master? - Disrobe. (soft instrumental music) Don't turn away, my dear. You'll get used to it. It's your turn, Rosemary. (tense instrumental music) Just one big, happy family. (tense instrumental music) - Albert's dead. - What are you talking about? - He's killed Albert. - When was this? - About an hour ago, I saw the body. - Did the duke see you? - No, we must leave here tonight. - But we can't leave until morning, it's impossible. - We must leave tonight, now. Our lives are at stake. - Maybe we should try talking to him. - Are you out of your mind? Don't you realize you're next in line for the kingdom? There's no time to waste, take only what's necessary. - Which servant shall I trust to come with me? - Rosemary, she's the only one. Hurry! Each second brings us closer to death. - Rosemary, Rosemary, Rosemary. (dark instrumental music) Hurry, Rosemary. - Hey, she's all yours. (tense instrumental music) - My dear Agatha, is there something wrong? - No, I was just startled, that's all. - Startled, startled at what? - Nothing, it's just my imagination. - What are you doing out so late? It's long past your bedtime, isn't it? - I was just getting ready to retire. - You never were a very good liar, Agatha. - Let's not go into it now, please, Norman. I'm very tired. - Well, perhaps you need your spirits picked up. Lvan, do something for the lady. (lvan grunts) - Stop it! (lvan grunts) Stop it! I'm going to bed now. - [Norman] Agatha. - Yes? (screams) (dramatic instrumental music) - She was only six months old. Six months and I had to give her up. I should've kept her with me. What a comfort she'd be to me now. Why do people do such foul things? We're all beasts by nature. I loved her so much, and she was so little. She was such a tiny little thing. - Why did you give her up? - Oh, only God knows. And he won't tell if I don't. - And you don't know where she is now? - No, she's gone, gone with the wind. I left one remembrance with her, a tiny gold token of mine. - Would you like some tea? - Oh, tea won't ease my heartache nor my sleepless nights. I'm being eaten up, MacGregor, up inside. There's a cancer eating inside me. Do you know what that cancer is? It has another name, it's called revenge. Hatred and revenge are my constant companions. - [MacGregor] You mustn't go on like this. Now lie down and... - No! I won't let sleep wipe away my friends hate and revenge. Ah, my lovely friends. (screams) - Please, God, please, help! I have nowhere else to go, help me. Help me, please. (dramatic instrumental music) He'll kill me if he finds me. Please, help me, hide me. - The duke? Who else but treachery himself? That son of a bitch! His mother was Satan, his father was king, a skunk should smell as sweet! - He's killed Agatha, and I shall be next! - He won't catch you, not if we can help it. Go saddle my horse, MacGregor. - But I... - Do as I say, man! (dramatic instrumental music) - How can I thank you enough? - There'll come a time, you'll see. - But I could never repay you. - You could repay me as you would a mother, with a kiss. What is it? - I had the strangest feeling that we've done this another time, another place. I don't know. - You're overwrought, my dear. - The horse is ready. - Oh, come, my dear, you must make haste! (tense instrumental music) God be with you, my dear. (tense instrumental music) (crow caws) (suspenseful instrumental music) - There's only one left, one heir to the kingdom. - Oh, what a pity, master, to have killed such a pretty thing. May I have her after she's dead. - Oh, why, Ivan, what peculiar taste you have. - No, master, I just want to pet her. I want to look at her. I want to lie down next to her, fondle her. Not what you're thinking. - It's a bargain. (grunting) (chuckling) You have one last errand to run for me. And then the kingdom shall be ours. - [lvan] Yes, master! - Are you happy? - [lvan] Yes, master. - Her death contract. (laughing) - I find it difficult to speak to you now. - What do you mean? - Now that you're a lady, I feel beneath you. - There's been no change in me. There's a change only in you. - I love you. - I've known for a long time. - You must go, your life is in danger. There's death all around you, go. (suspenseful instrumental music) - Marvin, no! No, please! (dramatic instrumental music) (somber, dramatic instrumental music) (Heather gasps) - I have to get you away from here. - Why didn't you just kill me? - You can't kill the one you love. - You've killed before. Surely my life is no different. - There's no time to talk, he wants you dead. - The duke? - Yes. - But I don't want his kingdom. - As long as you're alive, he's not safe. - Perhaps I can go to him and explain. - It's no use. He wants you dead, he can't sleep until you're dead. All his life, he's killed to get to where he is today. Only you stand in his way. (lvan screams) (dramatic instrumental music) (Margaret shouts) (dramatic instrumental music) - Heather, Heather, Heather, Heather, Heather. - [Heather] Margaret! (Margaret screams) (dramatic instrumental music) - Oh, where did you get that? - I found it with her when she was a baby. - It's my ring. I left it wrapped in my infant's clothes. - Where did you leave the baby? - To the north of here, Twiggett Lane. - Near Ramshead? - Yes. - Oh my God. - I don't understand. - Come closer, my dear. I must look at you, yes, blue eyes. You see, my dear, I'm your mother. But, I... - I told you, I found you when you were a little baby. - It's growing dim, come closer, my dear. I have something to tell you. In the chapel, behind the altar, you'll find an arrow scratched into the stone. Just beneath it, I've hidden proof of my identity. You see, my dear, I'm not only your mother but the queen, as well. - Oh, let's get her inside. - No, no, there's little enough time. Don't move me. You see, 20 years ago, I was praying in the chapel, pregnant with you, and mourning my husband's death. My favorite servant Kathleen was with me. I'd just handed her one of my capes when we smelled smoke. It was fall, and hay had been, as usual, stacked around the chapel. Flames shot out in seconds. We were terrified. We dashed for the door. Just as we got to it, my half-son Norman, Duke of Norwich, slammed the door in our faces. Then he bolted it, laughing. There was no escape. But Kathleen and I managed to get out somehow, and I wandered, half-crazy, half-burned, with a loss of memory, until I was taken in by northern nuns. Three days later, I gave birth to you. I didn't know who I was or where I came from. They had no sympathy for me. They took you from me and left you where MacGregor found you. I slipped my ring into your swaddling clothes. The rest is history. - Then Kathleen was mistaken for you and... - I had... It's time. Oh, kiss me. You shall be queen. Take care of her now, MacGregor. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. (solemn instrumental music) (triumphant instrumental music)
