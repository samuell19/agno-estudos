Close my eyes... Eyelids red inside. Open my eyes... The secret, nobody knows. Open my heart... No, I cannot. Open my mouth... The lie, being muttered. Close the truth... And it is eternal... TORCH SONG aka 'Luxurious Bone' What's wrong with you? I got an eel bone... stuck in my throat. Why don't you have some tea? Please. Anyway, it's a tasty trouble, isn't it? Maybe. - Here you go. - Thanks. Well then? It didn't work. What is that? Good tune, isn't it? It lingers in my ears. You look skinnier than before. I didn't do anything special. - Play the music. - Okay. Don't leave the door open. - Your eyes look puffy. - Really? Had I better find a job? It's not so easy to find a good one. You can depend on me. Thank you... but... Shut the goddamn door! I can keep doing my job, because I am frigid. - So, you don't need to find work. - Well... What's wrong? I feel a pain in my throat. Ebisu, Ebisu... Please watch your step. The door is closing. Meguro, Meguro... The next stop is Gotanda, Gotanda... You like the trains, don't you? Stop opening your mouth. It makes me nervous. Oh, I'm sorry. Please watch your step. The door is closing. Osaki, Osaki... Next stop is Shinagawa, Shinagawa... Please watch your step. The door is closing. The next after Shinagawa is... Yuraku-cho? No, it's not Yuraku-cho. Definitely Tamachi, okay? Oh, I'm sorry. Tamachi, Tamachi... Next stop is Hamamatsu-cho, Hamamatsu-cho... Please watch your step. The door is closing. Hamamatsu-cho, Hamamatsu-cho... Next stop is Yuraku-cho... Don't laugh. Hi. This is for you. - No! I don't want to! - Why don't you try it on? - It won't fit me. - Yes, it will. - No, it won't! Yes! I bought this for you. But it's your type of design. How do you know that before you try it? - I never do that. Stop running and come to me. You'll look great in it. Why do you force me? This is the one, designed for you. Oh, please stop it! - Will you try it? - No, I won't! - Try it? - OK! OK! - You sure? Hurry up. You look great! Look at yourself. - No... I look terrible. - Why? Miyako... are you upset? I'm sorry. I'm leaving for work. See? It fits you perfectly. So? - Well, I'm off. - Later. - See you later. - Take care. Hello? Miyako, how are you doing? Okay... You got a caller, whose name is Shintani. This is his first time. Will you go see him? OK, fine. Mr Shintani? Yes. Hey... Are you hungry? No, I'm not. You like a hamburger steak box, don't you? I heard the women from your office, 'Dangerous Affair', like to have a hamburger steak box. Why? First you would have a lunch box at a hotel, wouldn't you? It's something like a rule, isn't it? I have never heard of that, nor had a lunch box at a hotel. Well... What should I do with this? It was a very tasty hamburger. You ate it as if you were really enjoying it. Really? Never in my life have I seen a person... who enjoys eating like you do. Number one? Am I number one? Yes. Number one. Well, it sounds good to me. I'm coming... How do you know that song? My friend likes it. Your friend must be odd. - I don't think so. - I do. Your name, Shintani, sounds strange to me. Does it? Actually, Shintani's not my real name. It's the name of a classmate I used to tease. I wonder what's going on with him. I am getting to want very much to see him. You must be odd. Would you mind if I take a shower? Go ahead. What's the matter with you? What's up? Hey! Last night... I came for the first time. You mean where? "On the bed". I see... - Mr Shintani. - Yes. - I'll go home. - OK. - See you later. Is she okay? She's the one who likes that song. Still young. What? Are you interested in her? Not especially. Keep in mind that she is mine. Don't catch a cold. - You don't need to pay. - Why? I brought you here. Look! They'll fit Sakiko. Cute. Miyako... Why? I'm home. Hello, dear. Sakiko...? Hello? Mr Shintani... Please come here... What's going on? I feel pain in my throat. Are you okay? I can't... breathe... Miyako! Breath... Breath... give me a breath. - Are you a student? - Nope. Freelancer... I envy you. Open your mouth. - You have pain here? - Yeah. - How about here? - Yeah. - Here? - Yeah. One, two, three, One, two, three... I'll be able to get out of here tomorrow. You can stay longer, if you like. No. It must be expensive. You'll get money from the insurance, won't you? Yes. Anyway, what is that? A No Smoking sign... I'll not smoke again until the day that cast comes off. You, quit smoking! This is the last. I hear that. - In my throat... - What? - There's nothing stuck. - That's good. Yes... Are you exhausted? I got three callers yesterday. It was a little hard... You should quit the job. Like I said before, I'm okay because I'm frigid. But that man's different. Mr Shintani? Well... Are you jealous? Am I disturbing you? Come on, don't say that. I'll come for you tomorrow. Who's there? It's me. - Mr Shintani! - You come home late. - Sorry for sneaking in. - How did you get in? - The door was open. - Really? It was closed. - What? - Sorry. - Don't be. - You must be hungry. - Starving. Hey... - Am I good? - Well... Yes. Why do you ask? Sex with me, a call girl... You don't feel guilty? What are you talking about? Never mind... If there's no callers, I feel as though empty. I like to feel there are people who need me... so I can find myself. Sakiko understands that. What the hell... She's been smoking! Good morning. Sakiko... Good morning. Ready, go! You lose! Why?! Don't do that. You bastard! - I'm the winner. - Not yet. Let's do it again. Go on, do it. - Ouch! - You motherfucker! What the hell are you doing? Who did that? You? Son-of-a-bitch! Come down here! - What's up? - Nothing. I could only catch one goldfish, but the owner of the stall gave me another two. You got two for free? But why three? Like the three of us? - Let's dance, Mr...? - Not me. Come on, come dancing. - I don't want to. - Come on. - Why don't you wanna dance? - Because I can't. Will you... go to bed with Sakiko? Nothing, forget it. Do we have a bowl? - What're you after? - A goldfish bowl. - You can put them in anything. - But... How about this? Looks good. You wanna fall down again? Do you like it? I love this. Torch Song, by Humpbacks. - We had their album in my home. - I see. One day, I found my father listening to it... Your father must be young. No, he's not, but his girlfriend is. I can never play this bit well. - Sakiko, come here. - Coming. What? Will you get me a sanitary towel? Yes, but.... isn't it early? Mmm, but I am on. Can you play, Shintani? Not at all. Do you know why that band was called 'Humpbacks'? - Well... - Because the singer, Akio, had a stoop. Are you two hungry? - No, I'm not. - Are you? - Nope. - Let me tell you how the singer came to have a stoop... His first lover was a very small lady... She liked to do it in the '69' position, so he did it for her every time they had sex. Then he got a stoop. What a surprise that you know that! - Everybody knows that. - I thought it was true. You thought it was true! Excuse me. Miyako! What's going on with you? Nothing. I'm going to work. - But you're on your period. - I don't care. Some men like it. This is the song... my father's girlfriend used to listen to. I hated her, but I love the song. Music must have a mysterious power. It must be close. I hope Miyako's okay. I'm sorry. I am... dirty... I was told... that I was dirty. My father and his girlfriend said that to me. So... I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm talking about. You're not dirty... but beautiful. I was controlled by the desire to have complete possession of you, and my heart was filled with hatred for the folly of myself. A raindrop stain overlaps with your face. I have no idea where to go. One... two... three... One... two... three... Do you smell it? It smells like curry! When I was young, I smelled curry after playing with my friends. Just about this time of day. I thought... the smell of curry was like a signal: "Go home". So I headed off home in a hurry. Even when it was after dark, I didn't want to get back home... because I hated it. One day, after my mother had died, my father came home with a woman. From that day, my home became a place where I wasn't mean to be. See? The smell is back. Mr Shintani... Are you sure? I can't do this! I'm so dirty. People are dirty! I'll wash it all away. You are not dirty... Not dirty... Not dirty! We are all dirty. Everybody is dirty. Me, too. I am... The days, nobody knew The days, nothing existed I was exhausted, wandering... to find a place where I was meant to be I began to seek... for only true words of being and eventually threw myself into the depths of reality and desire Please give me a blanket to cover... my body and soul, colder than knives are Before the days disappear... The days when I wasn't aware of faults and impurity... Tell me how Sakiko touched you. Did she touch you? Did she? - Tell me how... - Don't do that. Did she touch you? Tell me. - Tell me! - Stop it! I'm sorry. What are you doing? I know everything... You slept with him. I asked him to do so. How was it? Supposed to be good? Was that... Was that so? How could you do that? Miyako... How could you? Sakiko? Sakiko! This is from your father. When are you coming back? I feel cold. I'm sorry. It was stupid of me to behave like that. Now I know... how cruel it was to her. Not only you, but me, too. Don't say that. I'm really sorry. Go back to your apartment... That is the place for you and her... and no longer a place I can be. Thanks. See you home? No, thanks. I can walk alone. - I want to do so. - Are you all right? Yes, I am. Mr Shintani! Remember the hamburger? I liked it. - I'm home. - Hello, dear. You still have pain? Nothing stuck in my throat. I don't know why. Miyako? Miyako! Choke me. Do it! Tighter! Sakiko... Forgive me. Ever since I met you... I've been in love with you all the time. While sleeping with him, I tried to feel you... I'm sorry for what I did to you... I'm sorry. I was holding Sakiko as if I were in an angel's arms. I touched her again and again, but I couldn't find... even small wings on her. - Can't you sleep? - No... What's that? A present from my father. - She looks strange. - I know that! She looked like me, so I liked her. Later, he bought this for me... but I refused to accept it. I was too stubborn. She looks kinda sweet. Miyako, let's go on a trip with my insurance money. A trip? I'll be able to have the cast removed tomorrow. - Well... sounds good. - Shall we? Okay... Let's take her, too. Hello? Hello. Where are you now, Miyako? Well, I'm... Where should we go, anyway? - What? - The trip. Oh... You decide. I see. I bought a suitcase big enough for both of us. - You are hasty! - Am I? - Miyako... - Sakiko... What? - Go ahead. - Thank you... for everything. What do you mean? I'll call you again. Okay. See you later. Hello? Mr Shintani. YES! One of my classmates once wrote in the year book... "Every one of us will die." But I don't even remember her name. We will die someday. I can rarely find things that I need, but it happens all the time... that I can't find anything... in the place where it is meant to be.
