Starring This is Chakkiri Kinta by Enomoto Ken'ichi The number one pickpocket. This is G-man Kurakichi, who tries to catch Kinta. This man looks like a candy seller, but is actually a spy of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This is the master of the inn, Joshu-ya, where Kinta visits regularly. The daughter of the pub, called Otsu, the sweetheart of Kinta. Osumi of deroren, looks beautiful, yet is boss of a scary gang. On the contrary, Oyuki-chan, a pilgrim girl, is so gentle.. Ohara Hataro, who wants to kill Kinta. The wheels of cause and effect keep on turning, A cat-and-mouse race going round and round, A running race between pickpocket and catcher from west to east on the Tokaido Road No place to stay under the sky of journey This is an extremely funny story. The Tokugawa Bakufu Shogunate enjoyed its governance and prosperity for nearly 300 years but, now, the bakufu is facing a critical moment for the next Meiji era. The two political groups Pro-Imperial and Pro-Shogunate compete ruthlessly. The feudal clan system is now blooded across Japan with a hundred million people. A turmoil of bloody wind and fresh air blows the clouds away. The people's dream is in confusion. However, can you believe this? In a corner of Edo, I can't see. Please. Dangerous! Shut up! I'll pay you. If I pay, you can't complain. We can't be quiet if our Edo is spoiled by such country samurai. What did you say? Say that again. OK. Then, I will buy the whole of this theatre. I can give you money, as much as you want. Beware of pickpockets No, no, gone. Stolen. My wallet gone. It was an important wallet. Me too. Stolen. What shall we do? My wallet's gone. What shall we do? Ohara-don, are you all right? I'm all right. We have been robbed many times. I am especially cautious. See? You are Kurakichi-oyakata of Hacchobori. We're unlucky. Do something. Are all the victims samurai? That's the problem. See? These kind of people. Hey, what are you going to do? Act quickly. Do something. All the victim were local samurai, that means... Chakkiri Kinta did it. Edo has a problem these days which is caused by oppressive samurai Bossy ones are always country men. Because of it, I can say picking is reasonable. Oh, no. I did it accidentally. Pickpocketed Edo person. Hey, this is yours isn't it? Therefore, giving back is reasonable. Bye. - Kinta-san, - Yo, boy. Don't say boy. - Because you are a boy. - I'm not a child any more. You are a child. Hey, Kin-ko. - Are they here? - Waiting for you. Kinta, we have been waiting for you. Listen all. I am rich today. Come along with me. Sure. Otsu, Kinta is fond of this (picking), rather than this (woman). Besides, he prays to god for giving up woman. Women disturb his pocket picking. So don't think so seriously of him. You went up, then came down quickly in such a state. No luck. Danna, long time no see, sir. - Come on. We met hours ago. - Where? - At Nakamura-za? - Nakamura-za? While watching the play, you were doing something sneaky. - Who? - You fool. Kinta. You can't play innocent forever. When the wallets of samurai are stolen, it's always done by you. Oh? Me? I am living decently. What evidence makes you say so? Evidence? Well, no evidence, but... You see? My eyes told me so. It's correct. You'll see. I'll catch you in the act... "And throw you in prison in Denba-cho." You want to say so, sir? I have long been listening to your remarks. My ears are worn out. If I have evidence... damn. Wait and see. Life is long, don't be depressed Suck some rice candy and live Sweet, sweet, now, buy, Rice candy The colour is white, the texture superfine Chunky and soft Suck and crunch Sweet, so sweet Sarashi-ame candy. Hey, what's with the noise. Move away. A problem. A big problem. Just between you and me, there was a letter in the wallet. The letter was an important notice from our lord to Sasaki Hokensai in Kyoto. I am supposed to go to Kyoto soon, together with the letter. I lost it easily. I cannot excuse myself even by seppuku. Is the thief only interested in money? If it passes into the hand of a Tokugawa's spy? Someone is there. What is the matter? Be careful, country bumpkin. You, oh, well. Now, the situation is not the worst. It is certain that the secret letter has not been passed to Tokugawa. And now we know the face of the thief. We will search until we find him. But the problem is, if an officer catches him, we cannot get the letter. We don't need an officer. We can catch him by ourselves. Yes. Danna, please stop, sir, Beware of pickpockets Danna, I did nothing. Fool. I watched you. Osamura-san, didn't you lose something? Gone. Kinta, now I've caught you red handed at last. Danna, I did nothing. Search me if you doubt me. Just come. I will return it to you. Please wait a little, sir. Come. Pickpocket. They've caught the pickpocket. Is he the pickpocket! Please leave him to me. No. Don't. Kurakichi is on the second floor. Kurakichi-san has waited long for you. And Satsuma the samurai visited many times. Satsuma the samurai? I don't know why they follow me. The country bumpkins are insistent. I hate them. Yes, they are. You touched me so hard, Don't. Kin-chan, you dislike me so much. No. I dislike not only you. I hate all women. - I doubt it. - True. If I am off guard against women. My skill becomes dull. So I hate them. Welcome, sir. The man called Kinta hasn't come yet? Usually he's come by now. I will come again. But we saw a man who looks like Kinta come into this house. I know nothing, sir. Why do you look so hard for Kinta? - We want to ask him something. - What is it, sir? He is an unpardonable man. I cut him once. Shhh! Where are you going, sir? I go anywhere I like. If you stop me you'll regret it. What did you say? This is not a mountain or field. You can't walk in freely. Move away. - You will be killed. - Move. No is no. You asshole! Clean your earholes and listen. Who do you think I am? I have white on my head, but I'm not spineless, afraid of a couple of swords, quaking at whatever a samurai says. If you want to search this house, kill me first. You are hiding Kinta somewhere. - I don't know him. - Move, move. I'm sorry, sir. Pardon me, sir. Actually, Kinta is on the second floor. Run away. You are in danger in Edo. This is something extraordinary. You will be killed. I kept this, which you gave me. Use this for your travel. You lied. He wasn't on the second floor. I can't understand it. I saw him there. Oh, this is the wallet I took from the samurai. Kinta-san, come back soon, please. Yes, I'll be back soon. What's this? Top Secret Keep this. Bye. Kin-san. Mt. Fuji looks splendid under the blue sky The sky is bright and clear That's a nice sky for a journey. I feel so good. Someone's talking about me. Hurry. Traveling under a blue sky with parting bundles over the shoulder In a cheerful mood I ask my feet where I am going Now, I can see over the pine woods those traveling figures. Inn Mishima-ya With huge eyeballs, trotting quickly, is such an Edoite staying here? The man came to this inn a while ago, sir. Thank god, show me the way. Wait, sir. Your footwear. Something looks strange. Be careful. - This room, sir. - Shhh! Hey, Kin-chan. Kinta-san. Kin-no-ji, hello. You bastard, Kinta! It feels good. What is that asshole Kurakichi doing now? One comes, yosa-hoi-no-hoi, when I pick someone's breast pocket, without thinking, my finger moves two come, yosa-hoi-no-hoi, touching sleeves, whispering something, moved from right to left unconsciously, hoi-hoi, five come, yosa-hoi-no-hoi, Female bath Come, someone please! What's the matter? Hey. I thought something was wrong with you. You're peeping. Well, no, dust on your shoulder. Please let me go, sir. Please. Is that the pilgrim we met before? Pity. Help her. No, I can't. She's so beautiful. - Then you go and help her. - You do it. Don't hesitate. - No way. - Then why don't we two go together? Please. I don't say I'll eat you, just ask you to accompany my drinking. I am rich tonight. Come, come. Who are you? Who? Open up. Come out! Then I will come. What's your business? - You tell. - You tell. Tell now! I told him "Don't do it". He insisted. No, I don't like it either but, he insisted, Well, the truth is, we want the lady back, sir. What? Stay as you are. Please forgive them. Wait. Who do you think I am? Calling my name makes a crying baby silent. I am Kondo Isamu of Shinsen-gumi. Tonight my lonely sword longs for blood. I told you I didn't want to. Your strange mercy brought us here. Come out! Namu ami dabutsu. Namyou horen gekyo. Kinta, I'm sorry. I've told you many stupid things, but forgive me. By a strange fate we must die together. I won't accuse you anymore whatever happens. Let us be friends again, at ease. Come out, or I will come after you. Move away. Come out! Wait. Please refrain yourself, sir. What is your intention by impersonating our great master Kondo? We are belong to the Mibutonsho unit of Shinsen-gumi, (sword instructors). I'm terribly sorry, sirs, please forgive me, sirs. Then we will go to your room where we will hear the details. Please forgive me, sirs. Please spare my life, sirs. We don't say we will kill you. You can just save our faces. In short, some money. Pay up or else. Bastards. How about 100-ryo? Isn't it cheap? If you can forgive me for that, then, I will pay now. Strange. I'm sure it was here a while ago. - You did it, didn't you? - What? Don't be silly. How could I do it at a critical life moment? It definitely wasn't me. Seems to make sense. Danna, you said just now, "I won't accuse you anymore, whatever you do. "Let's be friends again." - Yes, I did. - See? Sure, I said so. I meant in the other world, not this one. No, you didn't mean that. Thank you very much for helping my sister in danger. Thank you very much, sirs. Not at all. It was nothing. If you need me again... No kidding. You did it, didn't you? Excuse me first. - Hey, what's up? - Nothing. Excuse me, sir. Good night. If you like, shall we walk together tomorrow? Yes, please. You see my skill? You promised to walk with her tomorrow. I don't know what you'll get. But she's a smart mature woman. - You know nothing. - It is you who know nothing. - Know nothing. - Know nothing. Ooigawa River You and I are destined to be together Someday we will appear in the world True, true. Stupid. I can't hear any more. Have a cup. Someone is soft on a woman and the woman is also soft on a man. Hey, take it easy. Oyuki-san. Are you there? What's the matter? You are totally opposite to your sister. She is not my sister. I thought so. You can't have a sister like her. Unlike us in the merchant class, I believe you are the daughter of a samurai, aren't you? I have a reason not to disclose my identity, I lost my mother recently. I am on the way to visit my father in Kyoto. On the way I met the lady. She insisted it is dangerous to walk alone. Since then we've travelled together. No, it is not good. Forget it. She is... Wait. Why? Why should she stop? Tell me ni-san, why she can't be with me? If she is not good with me, she is not good with you either. It is good for both of us not to disclose our identities. What did you do? Damn, it was you, Kinta. Stupid, I thought it was Osumi. Better to stop, sir. You'll regret it. You know nothing. - Know nothing. - Know nothing. Due to Flood, River Crossing Stopped I believe the situation isn't so serious, but we can't do anything until the rain stops. I see. Welcome, sir. Early arrival, sirs. Yes, sir. He is staying here, sir. It is so busy now, I can't tell exactly where he is staying at present. I will show you all the rooms later. We got the river crossing stopped. With this rain, the guy can't go anywhere. Kinta! Danna, I did nothing. That's a lie. Then why you are so restless? You did your job at the river stop. No kidding, sir. I found a debt collector from Edo on the ground floor. Danna, I am with you. How can I do such a thing? That's why I can't get along with you. Hey, take care of Kurakichi. What's the matter? Nothing. Well, just a little inconvenience. No. Why you are so sneaky? Kin, come! What are you doing, sir? Listen, Danna, today is not good. - Why don't you do this tomorrow? - Hold your tongue. He was here a while ago. No, he didn't leave, sir. Isn't that him? Someone came into this room. - No, nobody. - Liar. Then, search. Ni-san, it's all right now. Come out. Hey, I have some business with you. Come out. Damn! Ne-san, give me the bill. I'm leaving now. Sir, the rain has stopped, but you can't cross the river yet. Never mind. Give me the bill now. Ne-san, where did you put my kimono? I didn't touch it. Strange. - The money has gone too. - You mean a thief? No, no, no. Nothing. Go away. Oh god. I am a thief-taker of Edo. How can I complain? But if I am too slow, that bastard Kin will get away. But I can't travel naked. I can borrow something from Osumi. Where is the guest from this room? They left in a hurry. I see. The woman did it. You all, we will now cross the river. Now, done. Forgive me, Oyuki-san. I don't want to do this, but I have to. - Damn, you, thief. - You're the thief. You deceived my friend sexually. Being soft on women is his fault. But you needn't have taken his kimono. That's why I hate thieves. Oyuki-san, I am sorry. Thank you very much, sir. Take care, sir. Is there someone called Kurakichi-san of Edo Haccho-bori? Edo-Haccho-bori, Kurakichi-san? That's me. Is he a thief-taker from Edo? If we give the pickpocket to him, all our efforts will be for nothing. I was asked to give you this. Watch out for the honey trap, from Kinta. Damn. Wanted Chakkiri Kinta Edo Origin Pickpocket No, he hasn't come, sir. Maybe he isn't heading west. We have searched everywhere. He must be going to Edo. Must be. Thank you, Banto-don. Ooigawa River Waiting Place I'm terribly sorry, sir. Are you hurt, sir? Fine day today, sir. Crossing river price list (Piggyback, carrier, etc) Hey, what have you done? You did something suspicious. Are you a pickpocket? Aren't you a pickpocket? Kin-no-ji, what are you saying? The guilty one is audacious. I don't have a friend like you. I don't know you at all. Sorry, just now, sir. This man behaved suspiciously. I think he is. Don't be silly. This is my wallet. Yours? He did it. Damn. Leaving O-Edo, I am a migrating bird I go wherever my feet take me Being carried, I cross the ridge of Mt. Hakone Mount Fuji calls me. So I sing, but my heart is heavy At an inn during the floating journey I am disturbed by a moment of love My heart flutters, but... Fool! How can you sing so nonchalantly? It's no laughing matter. I'll get revenge on you for this. Don't be mad. Have a cup. Danna. Danna, don't do anything stupid. What's stupid? You hurt me like this. - I didn't do it on purpose. - Shut up! What? Can't I say? What? You bastard. Are you against me? What are you grumbling about? Why pull such a face? - What? - Your face? What is that? What are you talking about? Damn you. Wait a moment. You two, will you leave your quarrel to me? I am Kobayashi Hachibei. It is said a peace-maker is the angel of the hour. Why don't we drink together? A willow on the bank depends on wind My girl's heart depends on her favour My wife has a beard Sake! It is the order of Kobayashi Hachibei, a ronin. Go. - We still have enough sake. - No way. Go. After the Tokugawa collapses, the one who will take control of the world, is me. When the time comes I can hire you with a top salary. - Say "thank you". - What? Appreciate me. Danna, is it true? True. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Kinta, wake up! Kinta, you did, didn't you? No kidding. I am not a child. Look, this is dry. Don't play innocent. You stole my money. Money? No kidding. You are so careless. Look, I was so cautious... Gone. Our luggage too. Kimono gone too. Come, someone. He talked big as taking control of the world, or hiring us or something. A nasty guy. Good morning, sirs. What's the matter? Where is the ronin? He couldn't pay the bill for a month's stay but, early this morning he paid all, and left. Paid in full? Danna, here is a good place. This is perfect. Stop it, stop. Help! What is it? Help! Come. What is it? Come. Look at this. What a ghastly sight! About that time In Edo Shogitai battle starting in two days. Move away immediately. Official Army Order. Kinta-san? Will you sell sake please? Otsu, prepare to move now. Dad, should we move after all? Of course. How could we live in such a dangerous place? But if Kinta-san returns what'll happen? If we don't stay here, we won't meet Kinta-san anymore. We can't think of such a thing now. Tonight, "boom" will start at Ueno. I'll stay here. I will. Even if this is burned to the ground, I'll stay. That's unreasonable. Don't trouble your dad. Ostu-bo, be reasonable. Wait! Give up your life. - I need the letter. - Who are you? Don't mind. Just take me to the place where the letter is. Shogitai battle starting in two days. Move away immediately. Official Army Order. Hey, don't stop. Let's hurry. Dad, I forgot a basket. You've returned for something three times already. If we are too slow it will be getting dark. Otsu, Otsu. Oh, there you are. Come back soon. Edo is in turmoil. It is, sir. Maybe we can't enter Edo safely. I wonder where Joshu-ya and Otsu-bo are now. Kinta. This is my last request. What is it? Help me to achieve something. You started again. No kidding. Kinta. Wait. Move away. Kinta! Kinta-san! When we wear uniforms like this we can enter Edo safely. Yes, we can't walk in Edo without them. Stop. Right face. When did you join our regiment? I, I joined the regiment three days ago, sir. Nice to meet you, sir. Where are they from? We have moved to Samezu temporary hut. Joshu-ya Joshu-ya Kinta-san? We have something to ask you. Come with me. We have no time. Forgive us a little violence. We are from Choshu-han (allies). Can we borrow two gun men? Certainly. Then, we'll borrow the two men at the end of the line. Attention! Forward march. You two stay here. Look, Kinta. Get up. Hurry. Otsu was brought to Ohara. She has been tortured. Jump on, now. Thus Meiji 20 (1887) No. Wait!
