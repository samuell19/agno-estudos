NOTHING PERSONAL The Newcomer Good day. No. Good evening. Pleased to meet you. Excuse me. Yes. Good day. Pleased to meet you. Good day. Excuse me. Do you know how to do this? Thank you. Nice tie. It's been 4 years since our last gathering at the safety course which is a great memory... M, hello, Bruno. How are you? Natacha Gauthier. Good day... Good evening. Nice, isn't it? Oh, we'll be working together as of next week. With the release of Pradex Head Office wants to redistribute skills. I stay in charge of new markets, but I'll also supervise production. In production, we're rather... independent. I'll just be there to help you cope with demand. We expect it to be huge. I know there's a productivity report on your unit, but I'd rather start over. Get off to a new start. If you agree... I didn't know. First, I'll watch how you work, then we'll define your needs in terms of resources. Excuse me. I didn't eat before I came. I'll see if they have any aspirin. Productivity has gone down due to poor process control. You should try benchmarking. Pardon me? Compare yourselves to other factories. Excuse me. Wouldn't you rather we discuss it on site? I won't take anything in tonight. Let's set a date. I'm always on site. Monday? I don't have my notebook... Let's say Monday. It'll be 1 week before the end of your trial period. You know about that? See you on Monday. Gilles Bergerat. Sales executive. I'm the union representative. Have you just been hired? This kind of event is so people meet each other. Did someone mention me? Don't worry, I'm not here to force people. I'm sorry. I'm at the end of my trial period. Everyone thinks I have a permanent contract, so I try to be discreet about it. I used to work for another lab. Same job... 15 years I was there. Then, they restructured and laid people off. To me, Muller marks a fresh start in life. When does your trial period end? In 10 days’ time. When did it start? Almost a year ago. That's completely illegal. There's no job at the end of it? They prefer staff like you that are easier to get rid of. I have 2 kids to feed! I had to accept a 308 pay cut. Don't get discouraged. It's not over yet. Are you the only one? I don't know. Do you have a referent? - I don't know. - Look, I'm here to help. There must be someone who assesses your trial period. You'll keep it to yourself? It's Gauthier-Stevens. - Mr.? - Mrs. Natacha. Do you know her? It's not normal. You won't say anything? She wants to increase production and if I can't handle it on my own - the night shifts, the controls, the overtime - I have to be a bastard with my team. That kills me. We'll see how many others there are. Wait. We can't let people behave like that. If she hears I've talked I can pack my bags. I'm dead meat. You can't carry on like this. No, leave me alone. It's my last chance. Come with me. She won't dare threaten you. Are you OK? It's nothing. There are laws to protect you. You're not alone. What are you doing? You're crazy! - No... - It's nothing. Somebody help! - Don't call anyone. - Spit it out! - Leave me alone. - Spit it all out. It's OK... Let's find an infirmary. No, it's nothing. Let me see. We must do something. You're crazy. It's nothing... Don't worry. It looks worse than it is. It's fine... No, it's nothing. Everything's alright. Paper napkins, please. No, a packet. It's for a... I won't let you down. I understand, I won't mention your name. But I'll look after you. We'll find a solution, I promise. - Yes? - Where’s the boss, Mr. Muller? He just left. You might catch him out front. Sir... Muller! I'm sorry. Do you have anything in the cloakroom? They can't find it. I'll have to come back. That kind of thing only happens to me. Married life 3 words to define the new packaging. Clear information, a trendy package, adapted to the various dosages. Good. But try to be more concise. OK, so... Clear, trendy, well-adapted. Great. Carry on. What if the guy claims his coworkers are underqualified? I promise him training for every manager. No, don't give in too fast or you'll lose points. Don't give him the advantage. Look him straight in the eyes. Hold his gaze. Do you use last names? I don't know. "We should have started this discussion, Mr." "We'll start..." Always be direct. I don't know, Damien... Don't get stressed out. Remember, the guy is just an actor who learns as little as possible. He knows nothing about medicine. Maybe he was a coach in catering before. He's a failed actor ! You score 120 points, 40 per coach, and they move you to Public Relations. We'll see... Or you can come to my department. That'd be possible. You have some lipstick there. Is that OK? Thanks. training seminar How are you? How are the children? Rozen! - How are you? - Fine, and you? Fine. My wife, Natacha. Pleased to meet you. I spent 3 years at MAF, now I'm at Bryden. See you later. Thanks. - Hi, Damien. - Hi. Good evening. Damien and Natacha Gauthier-Stevens. Gilles Bergerat is with the boss. Even the trade unionists are sucking up to him! Thanks. He pushes in front of everyone! How are you doing? They don't look that close. Let's go. Good day. No. Good evening. Pleased to meet you. Excuse me. Yes. Excuse me. Do you know how to do this? Nice tie. Thank you. Is this yours? The suit? You see, that's me, the real me. A pure cut. Agnès b. This is my persona. Just play-acting. I see. I act. It's a prop. Just like you need your bucket and brush to work. I'd prefer to do King Lear, but I'm like you - I have to eat. Hello. Pleased to meet you. Oh, no, everything's fine. Just fine. Our resistance to competition, to stay in the race, despite our human, family size, we owe it to you. So, tonight is for you. It is time. We can't wait for the latecomers any longer. I see most of you have found your partners. We can thus begin. The first objective : get your coach to increase production. The test is marked out of 20. The second objective is to obtain new working hours. This is also marked out of 20. I will announce each change of coach. Check the name of your new coach on the list you were given. Then, the assessors each start the countdown. Mrs. Barbieri we're short of badges. - Yes? - We're counting. 15 or so. The assessors are complaining. Too bad. The tests last 12 minutes per coach. M, hello, Bruno. How are you? Natacha Gauthier. Good day... Good evening. Nice, isn't it? Oh, we'll be working together as of next week. With the release of Pradex Head Office wants to redistribute skills. I stay in charge of new markets, but I'll also supervise production. In production, we're rather... independent. I'll be there to help you cope with demand. We expect it to be huge. I know there's a productivity report on your unit, but I'd rather start over. Get off to a new start. If you agree... I didn't know. First, I'll watch how you work, then we'll define your needs. Does the clinic director know? He's normally the one I speak to. The clinic director deals with manufacturing techniques and compliance with norms. I make sure production stays on target. But that's my job! No, not exactly... What use am I, then? Don't take it that way. You're at the heart of the system... You're trying to sideline me. Excuse me. I didn't eat before I came. I'll see if they have any aspirin. What’s going on? 8 minutes left. He's gone. It's a cocktail situation. ...you're not pleased to be here, but don't worry... Excuse me. I won't let you go! So I see. Productivity has gone down due to poor process control. You should try benchmarking. Pardon me? Compare yourselves to other factories. We do. Seriously? And where are the results? In my head. You don't have enough perspective. When did you last test your production line... Laurent? You could remember my name. When did you last test your production line, Bruno? Since you arrived? Excuse me. Wouldn't you rather we discuss it on site? I won't take anything in tonight. Let's set a date. I'm always on site. Monday? - I don't have my notebook. - Let's say Monday. It'll be 1 week before the end of your trial period. The way-in to a permanent contract? You know about that? I now also assess contract workers in their trial period. Monday? I've kept the line running for a year. Management won't accept your criticisms. But... that's not what I meant. Can we sit down? There are no free seats. See you on Monday. Wait... Don't take it like that. You left me no choice. Let's talk. I'll rationalize shift rotation and spread work out over 24 hours. Listen, I'll be frank with you. My wife is a pharmacist. The pharmacy is open 24/7. She's on duty 3 nights a week. I don't see her at weekends. Our 2 kids don't see her either. It's not a matter of comfort. I'm not asking for a sacrifice... Should I obey for your sake? Free of charge? I'm here to help you... Forgotten my name again? It's for your own good. OK? Wait for the next one. Any way of knowing? You can ask your coach for a debriefing. He can't tell you about the grading, but the rest is OK. What about you? I can't. Everything is done at your end. They'll tell you pretty soon. Thank you. Excuse me. ...old molecules were abandoned, then updated. That's not the case with Pradex Muller... My wife works for them. I work elsewhere. Mechanics - different field. You know her? Christine Barbieri. She's the one making the announcements. She was here just now... She really impresses me. I always say I haven't done much in life I haven't been lucky except for meeting her. It's not because she's my wife. Well, it is, I suppose. But all her colleagues adore her. So? I don't know how they assess us. Average, I guess. Not enough. Don't be negative. You have no idea. No, no idea. Listen, at the worst it'll serve as an exercise. It sucks. What’re you worried about? Nothing in particular. The beginning... the end... They don't care if you mess up. They're there to note your good points. To spot your skills. They take it into account if you're a smash. If you messed up, they won't downgrade you. Maybe. Don't worry. When there's an opening in PR... it's yours. We got married after 5 years. I was a bit scared. They say things change after you get married. I was worried, but nothing changed. I think a relationship works if both sides work at it. My wife is great, but she has a strong character. But it's give and take. If I slam the door she'll make the first move. If both sides make an effort... - Are you married? - No. You can commit later on in life. But if you're not in love, it won't work. They're scared of losing their jobs. I don't see... Think you're above it all? A buy-out in 6 months ! How many lay-offs? You should stop drinking. A buy-out? This shitty party is to impress the buyers. You'll see I'm right. Executives who haven't found their coaches can come to the platform. The 2nd test is 60 points with 3 goals... Mrs. Gauthier-Stevens? The last one overran. Let's find your coach. I need 5 minutes. It's a bit late now. I can swap you with someone else, but it won't be easy. What if I make do with the first results? It'd be a shame. I'll just have a break. Gilles, can I have a word? It's urgent. As union rep, what's going on? A dumb game for bored execs. It's not a game. They'll get rid of the deadwood. Why say that? I heard it. Someone from here and someone else. He said it wasn't true but I saw it was. They're hiding something. Muller will be bought out. Don't take me for a fool. What? Don't you believe me? Hasn't Damien given you guarantees? Guarantees? Of getting through it. I won't help you. He has no guarantees ! - He's head of the legal department. - So? He must know. You two must've known for ages. - Not at all. - Sure! You're talking nonsense! You're a liar, a dirty liar! What did he tell you, then? Excuse me. ...had to become part of the Muller family. They had to adopt its corporate culture. My wife, Natacha. Pleased to meet you. Natacha is in charge of new markets. You work together? Damien... Are you married? No, but as good as. Then you'll understand what I'm talking about. You see, being a couple is the best example of otherness, of sharing skills. Have you heard about the planned lay-offs? What’s that, honey? The buy-out of Muller. What buy-out? You'd have told me? I'm resuming my exercise. You would have told me? I would've told you. When the time was right. Damien... I'll be right back. There were some hiccups earlier with Barbieri. - She might pay for that. - I doubt it. I just saw her go off with Muller. You know her game. It's nothing. She's just feeling faint. Back up a bit. Support her head. It'll be alright. Everything's OK. It'll pass. Don't move. It'll be alright. I never hid anything from you. Nothing important. You must believe me. It'll be alright... Stop it! Stop it! - AAlright? - Yes, it's OK. Let Mr. Muller through, please. Let Mr. Muller through. Thank you. Step aside. Wait. We'll go the other way. - Calm down. - Don't touch me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Don't touch me! You lied to me ! Calm down ! Don't touch me ! - Calm down. - I said, don't touch me ! All together Pay us our overtime ! Oppose Muller's antisocial policies ! The members of the board doubled their pay by awarding themselves stock options, the amount of which they won't reveal. The supervisors still haven't been paid for their overtime. We must increase basic pay. This kind of injustice... Hi. ...mustn't spread to other branches. Nice tie. Thank you. Is this yours? You see that's me, the real me. Agnès b, a pure cut. This is my persona. Just play-acting. I see. I act. It's a prop. Just like you need your bucket and brush to work. OK. To entertain the people who come here. To teach them to express themselves. To be leaders. By acting? I teach them to be more effective. I'd prefer to do King Lear, but I'm like you - I have to eat. Everything's just fine. Thank you very much. Macbeth. Not Lear. Act V Scene 5. Lady Macbeth's death scene. I don't have time to chat. Give that to the cloakroom. Say it belongs to the coaching team. The coin... is for you. Shit ! Here, take mine. Thanks. What courage! The time for small talk is over, Mr. Muller. I wouldn't dare, Bargarat. Bergerat. If all the employees were like you... We want our due. Nothing's changed for us since'88. Without the production supervisors, and without the executives my labs wouldn't be what they are. We could talk on Wednesday, gentlemen. How does that sound? The union rep, Barbieri the financial director admin director... - A negotiation? - What else? We did say partners were welcome. I could alert the factory inspector. Our private lives do not concern you. No, Mr. Bergerat doesn't need those. His role as union rep exempts him. What if I insist? Seriously, I want to talk to you. What do you think I'm doing here? You're spending the apprenticeship tax. Hey, you finished yesterday. - Yesterday? - Read your contract. What did I do wrong? We never take anyone for more than 3 weeks. I wasn't told. Have I been replaced? That doesn't concern you. Give me back your keys. Don't waste your time. It is time. We can't wait for the latecomers any longer. I see most of you have found your partners. We can thus begin. The first objective : get your coach to increase production. The test is marked out of 20. In 6 to 10 months’ time I'll sell my shares to Tetra! Lab. Farewell, Muller Inc. I'm selling up. If I lay off 30 employees before the buy-out, Tetra Lab will think it's a lean machine. They'll pay more. And they'll keep me on. You promised to negotiate just now. So, you were talking crap! Just 30 people. I'm playing fair with you. 108? That's monstrous. - I'm asking you, Bargarat... - Bergerat. I want you to resign from your post as union rep. I don't know whether to laugh... at your pseudo frankness, at your cynicism. I won't touch production. The workers and technicians will stay, I promise you. You don't believe in my word? So, trust in your common sense. Tetra Lab will buy my range and my factories. However, for the executives... there's going to be a bottleneck. We'll fight, no matter what. You know that. If you leave the workers’ council, Tetra Lab will make you clinic director. The answer's no. Never, do you hear me? Never. I'll let you think it over. Think I'll keep quiet? Go tell people if you like. You have no proof. It's easy to find 30 people who are glad to take severance pay. Why fight for something they themselves won't defend? And you dare to preach... Before you make a choice or launch a campaign, go around your troops. Make the most of this evening. You think I'm acting against their interests. Maybe I know them better than you do. I work in mechanics - different field. What do you do? 2nd floor. Accounts. You know her? Christine Barbieri. She's the one making the announcements. She was here just now. She really impresses me. I always say I haven't done much in life, I haven't been lucky except for meeting her. It's not because she's my wife, but all her colleagues adore her. Honey, I didn't see you there. I'll leave you to it. Please... Don't make things more complicated. For now, it's just greasy food to fill their bellies. Wait for the second service: cream of artichoke. Hello. I know you... You work at Armainvilliers. I know you, too. I saw you giving out leaflets. And? It's good. We're lucky you're there for us. Is it tough there? So-so. Not really. We're used to it. I've seen worse. Don't you feel the pressure? Even so... When I go home, I take things easy, I do up my house, do gardening. That's what makes me happy. I wouldn't mind taking early retirement. I won't regret it when they send me home for good. If it was up to me... No, please go on with what you're doing. I'm just here to soften the mood... so to speak. Laughter for one so pretty Is wrong. O betrayal to inspire folly Whilst keeping one's reason Laughter for one so charming Feels guilty alongside it to add to one's dreams By one's excess beauty One thing perhaps Will surprise you It is that at your window the wind comes and trembles that April begins to glisten that the sea becomes level And that this means Warbler, build your nest Beauty with songs so naive I cannot admit that one is entitled to such bright eyes With such a cold heart When one is so well made One should hide A greatly missed lover Why bother portraying it? It's an opportunity for us all to meet up. It's nice to have made them bring their wives. How did your test go? Not bad. What do you think? Sometimes the hierarchy is ungrateful. Meaning? Seniority, networks... I've got what it takes. Well, yours is not an easy job. I can defend my territory. In a crisis? I bite. And the others? Who? What others? See you later. Mrs. Barbieri? The next announcement. We thank our CEO, Mr. Philippe Muller for his hearty performance of "The Disrespectful Demand" by Emmanuel Chabrier. I'm the husband of... Everyone knows who you are. Well, my conscience is clear. Is it? Not many people here are having fun. They're scared of losing their jobs. I don't see... Think you're above it all? You talk too much. If you're keeping quiet, you know something. A buy-out in 6 months ! How many lay-offs? You should stop drinking. A buy-out? Why a party when they want to fire people? Why spend all this money? Isn't it for training? No. This shitty party is to impress the buyers. You'll see I'm right. Do the people here know? The actors? It's disgusting. They fire people who do their jobs. Then, the work isn't done. It is now time for the second round. You have a few minutes to form your groups. The easiest way to spot the assessment team is to look out for their red jackets. Mr. Barbieri is blind drunk. He's starting to say certain things... I don't know how he knows. Right... Do we carry on waiting? 5 minutes. I can make an announcement or find another exec. No, it's OK, I have time. What’s the white wine? Bergerac, sir. The heady aroma of fresh butter and vanilla! Thank you. Don't I know you? Yes, Bruno Couffe head of manufacturing. I've seen you before. - You think so? Which site? - Melun. Of course... Wasn't that Alain Monnier? No, he left some time ago. Excuse me. Gilles Bergerat, sales executive. Union rep on the workers’ council. Where were you before that? It's my first year. Have you just been hired? Why all the questions? This kind of event is so people meet each other. Did someone mention me? You've grasped how things work here. Every man for himself. Good evening. Excuse me... It's rather stressful. Don't worry, I'm not here to force people. I'm sorry. I'm at the end of my trial period. Outside the unit, everyone thinks... I have a permanent contract, so I try to be discreet about it. You wanted me to come. Would you have rather stayed at home? You're not helping. I'm doing my best. I'm sorry. People don't necessarily find me unpleasant. That has nothing to do with it. Mr. Barbieri... I heard you don't like the way I'm handling this firm’s future. Mr. Muller... That you find the way I deal with the staff... - cruel. - No one said that. ...and other such crap. I don't know what you were told, or what my husband said to whom. It may have been in bad taste, but he meant no harm. I'm sure it's not serious. Christine, you engage in a lot of pillow talk. And I should know. But I can hold my tongue. - What did he mean? - What did you say? - Answer me. - You, answer me! I was just chatting. What did you talk about? The buy-out. - Where did you hear that? - You told me. You go on about it on the phone, to the mirror, to the cat at the bedroom door every night! - But never to me directly! - You shouldn't have listened. Now explain it to me. You didn't talk about him. We're going home. I used to work for another lab. Same job... 15 years I was there. Then, they restructured and laid people off. To me, Muller marks a fresh start in life. When does your trial period end? In 10 days’ time. When did it start? Almost a year ago. That's completely illegal. There's no job at the end of it? They prefer staff like you that are easier to get rid of. I have 2 kids to feed! I had to accept a 308 pay cut. Don't get discouraged. It's not over yet. I'll be right back. Thank you. Your wife's coat. She'll be right back. Either I give you it all back or you keep the token. You want to talk about it? That's not your style. the pleasure of love only lasts a moment the grief of love lasts a lifetime What if I told your wife? And your children? Mrs. Muller? Come on. You're a tease. Christine... Do you have a referent? - I don't know. - Look, I'm here to help. There must be someone who assesses your trial period. - You'll keep it to yourself? - Of course. It changed. It's Gauthier-Stevens. - Mr.? - Mrs. Natacha. - Do you know her? - It's not normal. You won't say anything? She wants to increase production and if I can't handle it - the overtime the controls, the night! shifts - I have to be a bastard with my team. That kills me. These people! Is it a target from on high or is it her? Stupid bitch! The stupid bitch! If she hears I've talked to you, I can pack my bags. I'm dead meat. You can't carry on like this. No, leave me alone. Come with me. She won't dare threaten you. - Are you OK? - Yes, it's OK. There are laws to protect you. You're not alone. What are you doing? You're crazy! - Somebody help! - Don't call anyone. Spit it out! Spit it all out! It's OK. Spit it all out ! Stop that ! Stop it! Let's find an infirmary. - No, it's nothing. - Let me see. Let me see. Wait a minute... You're crazy. Don't move. Paper napkins, please. No, a packet. It's for a... - Can I have a word? - I'm already with someone. It's urgent. I want some answers from you too, but not now. - What? - You're wanted over there. What? Have you gone insane? Come on. - As union rep, what's going on? - A dumb game for bored execs. It's not a game. They'll get rid of the deadwood. - Why say that? - I heard it. Someone from here and someone else. I saw it wasn't crap. They're hiding something. - Muller will be bought out. - Don't take me for a fool. What? Don't you believe me? - Hasn't Damien given you guarantees? - Guarantees? That the people you crush don't have. Don't count on me to help you ! Who do I crush? You know who I mean. Damien has no guarantees ! - He's head of legal. - So? He must know. You two must've known for ages. Not at all ! Sure ! I'd pay dearly for what you know. You're talking nonsense! - You're a liar, a dirty liar ! - What did he tell you, then? He's your husband, not mine! Excuse me. I won't let you down. I understand, I won't mention your name. But I'll look after you. We'll find a solution, I promise. You shouldn't give in so easily. In a redistribution of skills your coworkers will often submit you to that kind of gossip. It's natural. People don't yet know what they stand to win. They play on dissension to come out on top. What’re you talking about? You're bound to get a guy who tries pity. He'll use his family problems to do damn all ! I know it's hard, but you have to remain firm. And it's good to be incisive, but go easy on the criticism of the "rotten" contracts. I don't know if our assessor has any comments to make... Damien... Natacha, wake up. Natacha, get up. Stand back. She just needs some air. Natacha, wake up. Natacha, get up. - What’s wrong? - I don't know. She fell. Stand back. She just needs some air. Damien... Do you know what happened? She already felt bloated when she arrived. No, it's OK, thanks. - Do you want... ? - We can't all get involved. - Want me to call an ambulance? - I'll deal with it. Careful you should take her shoes off. Let me... Damien, you can't... It's OK, Gilles, we'll manage. You're hurting her. Listen... Can't you call him? How will I recognize him? Just ask. Philippe Muller. At the music stand. I need... to find... to write... What’s the... Paper. It's all I have. Excuse me. Mr. Muller? Mr. Bryden will send you his summary by Monday. Already a lot to read... We've ordered a car for you. The chauffeur went to pick up Mademoiselle from the hotel. I'll accompany you. Do you have anything in the cloakroom? At the hotel. Let Mr. Muller through, please. Thank you. Let Mr. Muller through, please. Wait. We'll go the other way. Who are you with? - Muller. - That's not Muller. I'll go check. After you. ... the moment, the crucial point... crucial point... I'm sorry about earlier on. I was sure it was an exercise. You came up to me, I didn't check. Frankly not possible... - Frankly... - It wasn't personal. I barely knew that Mrs. Gauthier. I have nothing against her... Let me do it. Dear Mr. Muller... I hereby... inform you... of my intention to end my contractual relationship with your company... permanently. Are you sure? The reasons which lead me to take this extremely serious decision... are as follows... I don't want to have any more to do with you or your crap. I hope your employees may one day follow in my footsteps. My only regret is that I can not help them fight you. I don't have the strength or the means but you won't get me all the same. It'll be here any minute. You sure he's the CEO? I heard it's not. Do you want to ask him? Me neither. Sincerely yours... - Yes? - I'm looking for the boss. Mr. Muller just left. You might catch him out front. Haven't we already met? You have the same impression? A European conference in Warsaw? July, two years ago. No, I'm not in pharmaceuticals. I'm a coach. Oh, yes, coach. Our little event. Did you work well? Do you think you've made them more effective? I hope so. Here... If you have time to take a look... There may be a few things which have escaped you. Sir... Human Resources Management needs Natacha Gauthier-Stevens: Rejected I'm sorry. I made a mistake. Anyone there? Open up. Open up. I'm Philippe Muller. Open up! That's an order ! Open up! I promise you the salt by kissing my mouth I promise you the honey by my hand touching you I promise you the sky above your bed Flowers and lace So you sleep sweetly I promise you arms to carry your worries I promise you my eyes I promise you... my eyes if you can no longer see I promise you to be happy if you can no longer believe I believe in it like... I believe in it like the earth and the sun I believe in it like a child like we believe in heaven I believe in it like the earth and the sun I believe in it like a child like we believe in heaven I promise you a story different from all others If you help me believe in it a bit... I can behave badly. But you? You can't behave like that. To hell with it. To hell with me, too? Do you want to go home? Let's stay a little longer. Here... This might be of use to you. If you need evidence. I've seen enough. It won't change things. But it'll give you time to think. How did you get this? An old friend. A conference in Warsaw. Thank you. Do you have anything in the cloakroom? They can't find it. I'll have to come back. It only happens to me... Take it. I have another one in the cloakroom. Thank you. Do you want a lift? Could you drop me off near the subway? Are you married? She's the duty pharmacist tonight. Nothing. It's a coincidence. I'm glad she didn't come. Subtitles : J. Miller Subtitling: C.M.C.
