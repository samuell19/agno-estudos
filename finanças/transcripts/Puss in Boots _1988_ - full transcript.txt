THEN I USED TO PULL UP MY SKIRTS AND RUN WHEREVER I PLEASED. BUT I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE EITHER. AND THEN I USED TO PRETEND-- I USED TO PRETEND I WAS A GOOSE GIRL OR A MILKMAID. BUT I DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE, EITHER. DID YOU USE TO PRETEND? YES. WHAT DID YOU PRETEND TO BE? A MILLER'S SON. AND YOU LIVED IN A MILL BY A MILLSTREAM, WITH DUCKS SWIMMING IN IT. AND THERE WERE WILLOWS HANGING OVER, AND THERE WAS A WATERFALL. THAT'S HOW IT WAS. THERE ARE 100 ARABIAN HORSES IN HIS STABLES. EACH ONE A GIFT... ...OF A DIFFERENT SULTAN! I CAN'T DECEIVE YOU ANY LONGER. I'M NOT A LORD. I'M-- I REALLY AM A MILLER'S SON. A MILLER'S SON? THEN YOU REALLY LIVED IN A MILL BY A MILLSTREAM WITH DUCKS AND WILLOWS AND A WATERFALL? YES. YOU ARE NOT THE MARQUIS OF CARABAS. NO. WHO ARE YOU, THEN? AND 100 ARABIAN HORSES IN THE STABLE. AND EACH, THE GIFT OF A DIFFERENT SULTAN. THIS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL MATCH FOR MY DAUGHTER. YES, SIRE! IT SHOULD EVEN PLEASE LADY CLARA. ( laughs ) I THINK IT IS CLEVER, I THINK IT'S WONDERFULLY CLEVER. MY PAPA IS COMPLETELY FOOLED. I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO YOUR PUSS, FOR IF HE HADN'T DONE THIS, I WOULD NEVER HAVE MET YOU, AND I MIGHT HAVE HAD TO MARRY ONE OF MY THREE SUITORS. BUT PAPA IS SO FOND OF YOU. HE DIDN'T GIVE A HOOT FOR THE THREE SUITORS. WELL, I DON'T THINK HE'LL BE SO FOND OF ME WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHO I AM. WHY MUST HE FIND OUT? LET US ASK FOR PERMISSION TO MARRY. I'M SURE HE WILL GIVE IT. THEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE! PERMISSION TO MARRY? WHY, YES, OF COURSE! DON'T YOU WISH TO MARRY ME? MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.
