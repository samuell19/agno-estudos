[RIMURU] The Calamity level monster, Charybdis, has awakened and is heading straight towards the capital city of Rimuru. I think it's after me. Maybe. Probably. ♪ We've assembled multiple forces to fight Charybdis. They consist of Benimaru's group, the Goblin Riders, the High Orcs led by Geld, Gabiru and his crew, and some help that's just arrived from King Gazel. One hundred Pegasus Knights, led by the captain of the guard, Dorf. This way we have an air-based combat force. [GAZEL scoffs] It's only natural that I send aid to Rimuru considering I am his mentor. Sir. [RIMURU] For some reason King Gazel has labeled me as his apprentice or whatever. Well, let's do this. [ALL] Right. ♪ Hell Flare, go! [RIMURU] That's Benimaru for you, nuking things like nobody's business, but... It's shocking that my brother's attack wasn't strong enough to destroy it. [RIMURU] There's gotta be a reason, right? [GREAT SAGE] Notice. Charybdis has the Extra Skill Magic Jamming. It reduces the efficiency of any magic used within a 300-meter radius of the creature. [RIMURU] Things just got a whole lot harder. Okay, first let's scatter and take out the megalodons. [grunting] [yelling] [grunts] I'll keep it from moving, you guys just focus on taking it out! [ORC] On it! [grunting] [yelling] Attack! [ALL yelling] [screaming] [grunts] [GELD] Great, now what? With my men down for the count, how am I supposed to beat this thing? [GABIRU] Allow me to lend you a hand! [GELD gasps] Vortex Crash! You're the best, Sir Gabiru. -It's true. -Treat the injured. Sir, yes, sir! [GABIRU] Just so you know, I was only able to get a clear shot because you were holding the megalodon in place. I appreciate the assist, Gabiru. [GABIRU gasps] We'll bring that one down, then leave the rest to you guys. [GELD] Right. Don't worry, we can handle it. [grunts] Yeah, go get 'em, Sir Gabiru. Come on, men, let's show these wretched beasts what the Pegasus Knights are capable of! [ALL yelling] [ALL shouting] [ALL screaming] Oh! Oh, no, run away! [ALL yelling] [GOBTA screaming] [laughs] They served as an excellent diversion. In battle, some will attack and some will play a different role. All parts are important. Hakurou's no joke. He does not mess around. Regaining his youth has allowed him to refine his tough teaching style. Hey! I wanna play with the shark monsters, too. What are you doing here? I thought I told you to wait back in town. Yeah, but you never said I couldn't watch. Staying in town was so boring! Just let me kill one of ‘em, okay? -No way! -[MILIM] Huh? [MILIM whimpering] Those sad eyes won't work on me. Master Souei, do it now. [SOUEI] Right. How do you like my Puppet Strings? [roaring] [BOTH gasp] ♪ [growling] [MILIM] Ooh! He's using his strings to make the megalodons fight each other! He's got good looks and good skills. It's so unfair. Finish off the one we just took down. As you command, sir. Leave the rest to us. ♪ Hold up. When exactly did Ranga learn how to fly? And when did he and Shion decide to team up? I'll prove to Lord Rimuru how valuable I can be in a battle. [RANGA] Indeed. We shall prove our worth together! [SHION yelling] Decapitating Demon Blade! [howling] I just wanna destroy them a little. Sorry, but the answer's still no. [whimpers] [gasps] [chuckles softly] All finished. Next up. ♪ [RANGA] I'm ready when you are. Let's see how strong that thing is. Sounds like a good plan. -[ALL screaming] -[MEGALODON growling] ♪ [GOBTA groaning] [HAKUROU] I'm disappointed. You couldn't even stop one megalodon. I'll admit that you've improved a bit since we started, but in the future, I think you'll benefit from tougher training. Huh? No way, old man, if it gets any tougher, we'll all die! Old man, you say? [chuckling nervously] [GOBTA screaming] Lord Rimuru. I think Charybdis is all that's left. Fortunately, we have a formidable army. Look there. ♪ Yeah, but that thing's so big, though. [GREAT SAGE] Answer. Judging from its size, the-- [RIMURU] If you're gonna tell me anything, then it needs to be how to defeat that monster. And nothing. ♪ Doesn't look like they're doing much damage to it. I agree. [RIMURU] It might be gearing up for something. -Don't let your guard down! -Understood. -[SOUEI] Right. -[RANGA] Thank you, master. We'll be careful. -[CHARYBDIS growling] -[SHION gasps] Watch out! Get away! [ALL scream] [grunts] [grunting] [SOUEI] I can't dodge. Dodge? Don't be a coward! [groans] [howling] [SHION and SOUEI panting] [RANGA] Souei, use Shadow Movement and get out of here. I will stay and shield Shion. No, Ranga. Don't be an idiot. I'll fight by myself. [RANGA laughs] I can't leave, not when our master would want you to have the highest chance of survival. You're right, he would want that. I think I'll stay, too. Besides, if anything goes wrong, the real me can withdraw before I get killed. -So there's that. -[SHION chuckles] Typical Souei. Well, okay, then I guess we'd better all survive. Hyah! [grunts] [ALL yelling] [RIMURU] You idiots need to simmer down. After all, I've got some pretty legit skills, too. [SHION] Lord Rimuru. [RIMURU] Devour all! Gluttony! [SHION gasps] [SOUEI] He dissolved all those scales instantly. Leave this dude to me. I want you guys to fall back for now and get some rest. But we can still help you. Just take it easy. And besides... the scales are already regenerating. If it uses that same move again, I might not be able to protect you in time. Let me take over for a while. You guys wait for Benimaru's orders. As you command. Please be careful, Lord Rimuru. [RANGA] Once I've rested, I shall return to help you, master. Sounds good. [grunts] Now, then, let's see if I can do some damage! [yells] ♪ [groaning] Oh, wow. [grunts] It looks a little damaged. Maybe. Still... does Charybdis have rapid regeneration or something? [GREAT SAGE] Answer. Judging from the speed at which it repairs its body tissue, it is safe to assume that the individual, Charybdis, possesses the Extra Skill Ultraspeed Regeneration. Aw, no! [GREAT SAGE] It is estimated that because of this skill it will regenerate its scales within three minutes. So there's only three minutes until it can launch that attack again. [exhales] [groans] Okay. Utilize all methods at your disposal and attack. No matter what, we can't give it the opportunity to recover! [ALL] Yeah! [RIMURU] The support of the Pegasus Knights increased our strength more than tenfold. So I really thought we'd be able to take Charybdis down with an all-out attack. [RIMURU sighs] We've been at this for hours, but we barely damaged the thing. Our strongest attacks only knocked its health down by 30 percent. What should we do? [CHARYBDIS groaning] -[RIMURU] Huh? -[CHARYBDIS] Damn you. Mi... Mi... Milim! [groaning] Wait, "Milim"? Did I hear that right? Hey, Great Sage, use Appraisal. [GREAT SAGE] Answer. Signs of life identified in the body occupied by Charybdis. The body appears to possess an intense anger. So the dude's angry? At Milim? So basically, Giant Eye-ball Fish Guy was heading to town because he has a bone to pick with our honey-loving Demon Lord? Meaning he doesn't give a crap about me or Veldora at all. Talk about overthinking it. Hold up. I've made Milim sit on the sidelines for nothing. And she's asleep! -Milim! -[gasps] [shudders] I've definitely been awake the whole time, I swear! No, you were definitely asleep. I was just meditating. And silently cheering you on with my eyes closed! [sighs] I'm sure. Anyway, the giant tuna thing apparently has business with you. Really?! Oh, yeah, it looks like it possessed that Phobio guy who ticked me off the other day. [inaudible] The Beastketeer? Okay. Well, I had you sit out because I thought he was after me, but I guess he's not, so... Are you trying to say that I'm allowed to pulverize him now?! [chuckles] [MILIM laughs] I feel kinda bad about all this. Looks like you could have been helping the whole time. As long as I get to play with him now, it's okay. -I'll crush him. -Oh, hold on. Didn't Phobio say something about working for Demon Lord Carrion? Is there anyway you can kill it, but save him? [laughing] Easy work for someone like me. I actually possess a lot of restraint, you know. Uh... [RIMURU] She does? Since when? [DORF] All units, fall back immediately! [CHARYBDIS grunts] [growls] Milim! Milim! Yeah, yeah, I've already seen that trick. But you haven't seen any of my moves yet. Now, I'll show you what restraint looks like! [energy charging] Drago Buster! [explosions] [RIMURU] Maybe we define "restraint" differently. There he is. [grunts] Gotcha. Now that's what I call restraint. [MILIM chuckles] [heart thumping] [GREAT SAGE] Notice. The magicore of Charybdis has been completely removed from Phobio's body and consumed. Preparing to isolate it and begin Appraisal. [sighs] -[RIMURU] Hmm? -[BENIMARU] Hmm. [water splashes] [energy humming] That should fix him up. [DORF] Lord Rimuru. [RIMURU] Hey, Dorf. Thanks again for all your help. We couldn't have taken down Charybdis without you. No. We didn't do anything to Charybdis at all. Huh? [DORF] Can you explain what's going on here? Well, sort of. Would you believe me if I told you this was Demon Lord Milim? Hah. [DORF] Hmm? Hmm. Truly? [MILIM] Mm-hmm! [laughs] I see you have a fondness for pranks, Lord Rimuru. -[MILIM gasps] -In the future, should you possess a similar powerful magical weapon, do try and use it at the start of the battle instead. It's not a prank, I'm a real live Demon Lord, damn it! I blew Charybdis to pieces! I see. You want to keep your weapon a secret. Well, I understand. Keeping your trump card to yourself is a wise move, you know. I'm telling you, I killed it! [DORF] Charybdis could have rained all sorts of disasters down on the world, so its defeat benefits us all. I suppose we should take our leave and get back to the king, I'm sure he'll be awaiting my report. -[MILIM] Don't ignore me! -Thank you again for your help. And please give King Gazel my regards. [RIMURU] Hey. You awake? [groaning] What the... Where am I? And what the heck happened? [RIMURU] Are you saying you don't remember what you did? [PHOBIO gasps] Please forgive me! I've done something unthinkable to Lady Milim! And worse, I've involved all of you in it as well. [RIMURU] Yeah, but why? How did you know where Charybdis was sealed in the forest? It would be nearly impossible for you to just stumble upon it. -[RIMURU] Answer them. -[PHOBIO] Of course. You see... Hold on. Masked Harlequins named Footman and Tear? Did the mask look like this? [PHOBIO] No, the ones I met were a girl with a tear under one eye, and a heavy-set man whose mask had an angry face. [gasps] Wait. I wonder if it was Laplace? -[RIMURU] Who? -He's a clown, too. Laplace said he was a servant of Lord Gelmud when we spoke before battling with the Orc Lord. He was wearing a mask like the one Treyni drew in the dirt. [RIMURU gasps] [GABIRU] Also, I think he said he was the vice president of some jack-of-all-trades group, called the Moderate Harlequin Alliance. [RIMURU] So, the dots are all connected. I see. And you say this man goes by the name of Laplace? Footman, huh? I'll take great care not to forget that name. Yes. Me, too. [RIMURU] So there's a mysterious group called the Moderate Harlequin Alliance. And they pretend to help you, but in reality they're fulfilling their own goals without getting their hands dirty. Sounds like a big bag of nope. [MILIM] Hmm? Hey, why are you looking at me? I don't know them, though, if these clown people really do exist, I think they'd be fun to meet one day. [RIMURU] Hmm. And also, maybe it wasn't Gelmud. It could be that Clayman's actually plotting something in secret. So there. [RIMURU] Why him? [MILIM gasps] [MILIM] Well, he's really scheme-y like that. [RIMURU] Demon Lord Clayman, huh? [PHOBIO] Regardless of whoever's scheme it was, what happened is my own responsibility. It's not Demon Lord Carrion's fault. So please, take my life, but leave him out of this. [RIMURU] Meh, next time don't let a couple of clowns make a fool out of you. [PHOBIO gasps] [RIMURU] I think we're good here. See you around. But I... What I did was unforgivable. [RIMURU] Bro, if I say we're cool, then we're cool. Right, Milim? Right you are, Rimuru. I did think about giving Phobio just one good punch, but I'm far too mature for such actions. [RIMURU] You admit you thought about it, though. I'm not still mad at you, so don't even worry about it. [RIMURU] There you have it. We're all good. For sure. -Is that okay with you, Carrion? -[ALL gasp] [gasps] [PHOBIO] Lord Carrion! [scoffs] So, you knew I was here, Milim? [MILIM] Yeah, naturally. [RIMURU] This guy is Demon Lord Carrion? Hey, thanks for being so understanding and sparing my foolish servant's life. [RIMURU] Hmm. [CARRION] So you're the masked majin that defeated Gelmud? [RIMURU] Yep, that's me. Are you here to avenge him? [scoffs] I'll pass. Get up. [PHOBIO] Yes, sir. [gasps] [loud thud] -Sorry about that. -[RIMURU] Huh? My subordinate got carried away. And it's my fault for not keeping a closer eye on him. Please forgive him. Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you. I'll owe you one. If anything comes up in the future, you can count on me. [RIMURU] Now that you mention it, what do you think about possibly entering into a non-aggression pact with our nation? [CARRION] Is that all you want? Fine then. We can sort this out right now. On behalf of Eurazania, in the name of the Beast Master, Carrion, I swear that I'll never raise a blade against your nation. Thanks. Sure. Come on, let's go. That dude's bleeding everywhere! We're bound to meet again soon, Rimuru. Okay, then. It's all over. Let's go home, guys. [ALL] Right! [GREAT SAGE] Next time, "Yuuki Kagurazaka."
