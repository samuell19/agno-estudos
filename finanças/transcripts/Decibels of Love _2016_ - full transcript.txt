Here we go, I’m sure I’m right, the neighbours gossip about me again, they see I’ve lost weight, they see I’m not a miser, that’s me... Yeah... Going to fight today? How sad. Training for difficult times. They all gather around me, because my style’s great, that’s my extra bonus point. They just keep staring and staring, they’re not really friendly. Why do they just keep staring? They’re not feeling well, I guess That’s great, man. Sure I’m a bit eccentric. I never wear a clerk’s suit. I’ve got a huge wardrobe full of crazy stuff, so cool! Go, man! They just keep staring and staring they’re not looking friendly. They just keep staring and staring, they’re not feeling well, I guess. Let them say what they will, I can buy a coat made of reed. Perhaps that’s why I feel great, I know what life’s about, I really do. They just keep staring and staring, they’re not looking friendly. Why do they keep staring? They’re not feeling well, I guess. FINANCIAL DIRECTORATE FOR THE CITY OF PILSEN If we don’t get locked up for this, we’re really lucky. We have to go back. - Are you mad? - It’s a piece of art, - we forgot to take a picture. - But if we put it on Facebook, it’ll be obvious it was us. It’s obvious already anyway. Look. An artist is never ashamed of his work, remember that. Director? What’s the occasion? The beauty of our ladies and the speed of our horses. Well, it’s a good thing that it’s not vice versa. I’ve got a similar collection at home. And now just one is enough for you, right? It’s just for chasing away unpleasant... Yes, that too... But I was actually thinking of unpleasant memories. So are you good at golf? Well, I hold the club like a pig clinging onto a bone. - Just don’t strain yourself too much. - Me? Never. It’s not mine anyway. I know a woman who knows a man who knows you. Allegedly, you used to be a wild one until recently. You know, when you’re alone... She was young with no sense of responsibility. She just wanted to have fun. I wanted to try it for a while as well. It was a nice change after all those years. To be free again. But it’s gone now. I’ve even forgotten about my own son in a way. You probably don’t know what it means to fall in love, and do really stupid things afterwards. Why wouldn’t I know? Do I look so inhuman? So you know what I’m talking about? Perhaps, but I’m the one asking questions. It’s my occupational disease. So what about your son? Well, I brought him up on my own. Are you a journalist or what? Just a bit. So how did you manage it on your own? Not very well, we’d always fight to be perfectly honest. It was as if I lost the most important battle of my life. Almost everything can be mended. Be optimistic. People talk of optimism when they’re half fucked. I beg your pardon?! Oh, Miss Sunshine in person. Sunshine, Sunshine. Come along, the world is in a hurry. This day is your new beginning though you’ve been an adult for a while. So you can enjoy yourself, you’re your own master. This day is the beginning of things. Your life is in your hands. Hi, Aneta, have you seen my file? It was here a while ago. With your famous modelling photos? It was over there. I must have put it somewhere else then. Sorry, I’m a bad mood. How about going somewhere for a booze-up? - Why not. After dancing? - Yeah. - Alright. Aneta, your turn now. Let’s drink to your health! All the best today! Let’s go then! Five, six, seven, eight! Go, go, go, go! Well done, let’s call it a day. Great! - It was really good today. - Let’s go and see the world. - Yeah. - Bety, Aneta speaking. Future Koukalová. - Stop it. - How much time have you got? Loads, but I’m going to see my aunt tomorrow. Listen, how about celebrating our photo success with a bottle of champagne and then going to my place? We’ll be cool... Really cool! - Magda! - Oh, hello! So where were we? At the optimistic retort that almost everything can be mended. Speaking of which, you’ve never told me what actually happened to you. Do you really want to know? Well, some plumbers were installing my internet connection in the barn... What? Plumbers? And you live in a barn? Well, at my cottage, the signal is strongest in the barn. What is it? Plumbers install things, don’t they? So why not plumbers. But perhaps it really was the water pipes people. Because the internet stopped working after a few days. I thought a marten had bitten through some wires. I love sport, as you know, so I started climbing up a ladder. And when I was nearly at the end, the last rung broke under me. And you can imagine the rest. I hit my head like this on the ladder, and my leg didn’t enjoy hitting the ground at all. I often ask myself why such things happen. Is it fate or just old age? Definitely not old age, because you look great. I meant the age of the ladder. I’ve had it since the invasion. What invasion? Which one? There were more of them. If you’re suggesting I actually met Napoleon, beware of my crutch! Well, it was fate. What can you do? But much worse things can befall. Some people are not blessed with being able to grow old with those they love. It’s a thought worth publishing. Unless it’s been said before. - Everything has been said before. - This man wasn’t blessed... or I wasn’t blessed to grow old with him. You don’t know about it, but we’re going for a trip. I’m not capable of driving a motor vehicle at the moment. Since when has a funeral been called a trip? Don’t worry, every cloud has a silver lining. How do you do it? That you never lose faith. I don’t do anything. I just hide things better. So here’s to that trip of ours. Hovorka, listen, I refuse to discuss this with you. The essay about community service was Zeman’s task, but he’s been promoted. Great, but I can’t make it. I did the dustbins on my own this morning. No worries, we’ve got reinforcements. There’re number codes on the tools. So don’t flog them in the pub. Oh man, why me of all people? You mean this dream team? I’ll take care of it, alright? Yes, please! So, all those condemned to community service, attention! We’re going to sweep the square! You know what sweep means? And square too? Let’s go then. Mr Koukal... May I? No, no, no. I’m sorry, come in. You never disturb. Do you dance? I see, what a pity. Dance has always been a means of expressing emotions, wishes, desire and eroticism. Alright, show me our tax balance for the first six months. I’ve got some interesting figures for you. I used the same creative accounting of yours as last year. I see you don’t really need the figures. Or should I dance it for you? - Do you mean a pole dance? - Excuse me, Mr Koukal, I’m sorry, but Miss Rajská’s got a call from the city police. - It’s urgent. - I see. It looks like you’re desperately wanted somewhere else as well. I just hope it’s not related to our company. - Of course not. - Alright then. SURGERY Anybody else? Oh, Mr Hovorka, good morning. Good morning. If it’s personal, please wait, the doctor’s getting changed. Thank you. Kristián, please! What’s up? You’re my ex, you didn’t use to mind this. - You cannot step into the same river twice. - Let me carry it for you. Thanks. Have you talked to Jitka? It’s you daughter’s birthday, I’m curious what you’ve got in store. Can you help me with choosing a present for her, Miss Bright? I’ve got no idea at all. - I screwed it up, didn’t I? - No, it’s just your lifestyle. - Saturday night fever. - Come on, not anymore, I’ve changed. I work hard now. If I had known... - She’s a big girl now. - So help me with the present, please! - You know nothing about her. - I do. I still have all the photos. - Christmas, birthday parties... - Well, that’s it. - How about a photobook? - I was thinking of a perfume. No, she’d love this much better. And wake up. You’re not bad deep down. It’s mad, it’s wild. Our mums don’t live through this with us. Bright lights in the mist of love, and songs which never end. JITKA, BIRTHDAY PARTY... Hello there. Hi, DJ, so see you today. - Yes, alright. - Same as always. - I’ll be there 9ish. - Great. Okay, see you, bye. Oh man! What a night. CITY POLICE, call not taken Leave it. This Hovorka is a nice guy, and in fact also you’re only hope. He used to be the same nutter like that little brother of yours. But you know, times were different back then. Your brother must be totally stupid. Look at this. The only chance is pulling it off with the offence committee, and make them consider it as a community service punishment. It won’t be easy though. But your boss knows people, doesn’t he? - Koukal? - How about him? No way, I prefer trying it on my own. Listen, better luck next time. Thanks. Nobody came. Why did I even invite her? Why did I turn my face away and believe all those promises? Why did nobody come to visit my apartment? I never left it, as I had nowhere to go. None of this should have happened. I won’t invite you anymore. I won’t take the bait next time knowing you for such a short time. Have you gone mad? Or are you burnt out? - Look at that, mate. - What is it? - Look at those incredible women! - I don’t have time for that. Viky! He can’t get through to you on the walkie-talkie. Yeah. What is it? I can’t hear you, but if she’s got no gun in her knickers, you can let her in. I know the boy who made it. Both the mirrors and the angels. - Really? - Hello, beauties, what would you like? Hi, Viky, is there anyone from our group? Yeah, but you’ve got your young Koukal here. Hi, love. You know Betka, right? - Hi. - Hello. - Let’s get wild tonight. Hello, girls, I’m glad you’re here. I’ve seen the previews, absolutely amazing! I think the client will go for you. What client? Wait, is this about escort service? Stop it, she’s way out of your league. - I see, a local celebrity. - Here we go, one mojito. Mojito? We wanted a vodka cocktail. Oh, I’m sorry, but drink this anyway. It’s a lot healthier and it’s on the house. Anything else? - Have you got a minute? - Sure. - Who is he anyway? - It’s Dan, love. Of course you know him, he did the décor here for you. - A bloody interior decorator? - No, he’s an artist. But he’s alright. You’re amazing! - Come on, let’s take a picture. - Yeah. - Can you take a photo of us, please? - Sure. Girls, would you like a drink? Well, you’re really trendy, I must admit. Mojito, please. And how about a bottle of champagne for me? You can find us later. Where did you learn to dance so well? There’s a dance hall next to the town hall with free entry. My turn now. Why angels? I simply like them. And they never die, you know? So you charm girls with angels, right? No, but I was brought up by my sister. She told me angels were like my parents. They keep an eye on me and help me. So do angels stand a chance? My name’s Alžběta, but friends call me Betka. My name’s Dan. And they do stand a chance. They can also dance. Get in touch then, my angel. Come along, angel, come and take a piss with us, we’re too scared. So what are you scared of, boys? - Stay away from that girl, get it? - Leave her alone or you’re dead, loser. - Have you got a contract or what? - What the hell is this? Stay out of it, man. - Take it easy. - It’s alright, I’ve got this. - Really, idiot? - Two against one, you pussies? This is Koukal’s land, you see? I’m in charge here! Sure thing, mate. You’re a real tough guy. Myself and your dad come from the same suburb, we used to share girls, you see? - Let’s get out of here. - You idiots! Wait, I’ll get help. Viky, what happened? That fucking artist of yours attacked an older guy. Him? He was really nice, he bought us a drink. What are you talking about? Dan would never do this. - Never say never. - You fucking bastard! - Hey! - Ali, get rid of him! - Leave him alone. - Teach him a lesson. So, shall we go to Aneta’s, girls? I want you just for myself. - What’s up? - I’m an idiot. Aneta’s friend gave me her number, and this is all that remains now. - Do you know where she went? - I don’t, but she left with Aneta. She went with her, but she wasn’t alone. I know, that’s the problem. Andrea, Andrea, please! And how about my reward? If I tell you where Aneta lives... - Whatever you wish, dear. - So I’ll let you know. - Good. - 13 Vítězova Street. Go! - I love you. What a bastard! I feel like I’m being trapped, my world’s falling apart, I feel so alone. There’s no shooting star so I can’t make a wish. To be with you, my love, to be with you and love you. I keep looking for happiness everywhere, I want to take it in my hands and dream. But happiness is hard to catch, it has wings of a butterfly. And if you do catch it, it’s just for a while. Only love, a lovely story can give us both what we need, but you really have to wish that. Only love, a lovely story may it be real, not just a dream, only that can save us. Why am I alone and not with you... - Thanks, Vašek. - It’s nothing serious. No serious symptoms or indications, a slight concussion at worst. Thanks. Hi, Jitka, they’ve just brought your dad. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine. He’ll be in room 7 if you want to see him. In one hour. Okay. Bye. Hurry, there’s nowhere to hurry now, leave your hand in mine so we can dream. Pulse, before I check the pulse, I’ll mend all that’s broken if there’s a will. What happened keeps me awake, you’ve conquered many times, but you know losses too. Dad... Even if your life hanged by a thread, you could still count on love, I know, I know, you used to say that. And even if your memories are so lovely, they do fade away in no time. What can one do? What can one do? - How do you feel? - Terrible. - I’ve got a splitting headache. - Do you want some pills? I’d prefer a cold beer. Take it easy, youngster. You know who did it to you? Young Koukal, they say. Say something. You don’t care that his dad destroyed your life? That he dropped you in that mess? Why don’t you say something? He can’t keep doing this. You’re so stubborn. Jitka was here all night with you, so do something about that at least. You obstinate mule. Bad luck, I know my bad luck, but I’ll get a second wind. I’m sure I will. Slowing down, taking it easy, is not what I have to do right now, I can live with that. I can still play the old cards which fate likes to deal. I know it. Even if one’s life hangs by a thread, one can still count on love, I know, I know, that’s what people say. And even if one’s memories are lovely, they do fade away in time. What can one do? What can one do? Hello, mate, you look great. Move on. Well, sorry. Bye. If you get locked up in the end, I’m done. I’m really done. - Good morning. - Good morning. I’m sorry to disturb you, but I’d like to thank you. Oh, it’s you. I was worried you were half-dead. Well, I can walk and talk. I might be stupid, but I’m alive. - Thanks. - Yeah. Oh, my name’s Dan and this is my stepsister. - Rajská. - Hovorka. May I know what happened yesterday? Well, it might sound silly, but Dan actually saved my life. Give me the car key, I’ve just realized something. I’ve got something for you. - Where do you know each other from? - The loo. - The loo? Yes, since last night. At the disco. Jesus, you go to discos at your age? Here you are. It was behind the bar, mister DJ. - Jesus, thanks! - You left it there before the incident. Shall we go? - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. One of them disappeared, and the other one got cheeky, so I ran away. Betka, you might not realize that, but you did the best tactical thing. Now you’ve become unreachable. Anytime you want to attract a nice guy, you must be like that. - Roger that, general. - But don’t overdo it. Men might get scared or lose patience. And what exactly is the problem? Why are you still single? Well, there was someone, but it’s the one who disappeared. He was nice, I gave him my number, but he didn’t get in touch. I don’t know. How could I give you any advice? I used to be chased by all the men in the world, but it never worked out either. I thought you always had the upper hand. Well, I was pretty courageous. I couldn’t be a journalist otherwise. I might have had the upper hand, but not with all of them. I even wanted to get married once. But I got a job, to do an interview with an artist 2 weeks before the wedding. It had always been teachers, firemen, gardeners and such like until that moment. And then suddenly... an artist. He was wonderful, very funny, intelligent. So I called off the wedding. But it went well with the artist, didn’t it? Well, I fell in love head over heels, that’s for sure, I stopped eating and started smoking. But the artist was spoken for. I almost lost my job, too. But I pulled through in the end, of course, but I couldn’t get back to my ‘cancelled’ husband, nor to any other potential spouse, in fact. I didn’t even try. But you’re still a hot woman. Betka, if you really want to flatter me, go to Moravia with me. Funerals are part of life too, you know? And we can get a lift. With this charming director. You wouldn’t let me go with a complete stranger, would you? - And to a strange place, right? - Yeah. So your first love dies and you go to his funeral with a new boyfriend. You’re unbelievable. The concert of Michal David in the city of Pilsen is just a few day away. We’ll also talk to him on our Pantheon programme on September 14 at 8 p.m. So be quick! Ota! Where are the evaluation forms? Why are you shouting? This has just arrived by mail. Listen, have you ever paid for sex? - I know it’s weird, but... - Not weird, just expensive, that’s all. - Is it growing, is it growing? - Don’t be stupid. An instalment plan for hair. I can’t believe that! Come here, you’ve got to see this! Excuse me, I’m looking for Mr Hovorka. Almost. Oh, good afternoon. Come in. Oh man. What is it? You said you were grateful to him, and I don’t really want to know why. - But I want to ask you for a favour. - What can I do for you? My brother’s a nice and talented person, he can paint, act and sing, I know he’d love to do it for a living. So it’s a good thing, isn’t it? - Yeah, but that’s not the point. - So what’s the point then? How is it connected with me? You’re my only hope now. Have you got a vacancy? Could he do community service with you? Mr Hovorka, I beg you. - Would you like a cold one? - Thanks. - Should I go and help them? - No, let them enjoy it. But tell me why you did all those stupid things. It wasn’t stupid. It’s like a craving. - You never felt this? - Of course I did, and I still do. For example? - You wouldn’t understand that. - Really? Listen, that craving of yours has nothing to do with art anyway. Oh, my sis asked me to tell you to ring her up. I don’t know why, she might just want to know if I behave myself. - Ota, thanks for helping me out. - It’s alright. - Dan has to go to the dance hall. - Of course. - But you owe me one. - And leave the coffee alone. Sure. Bye. It’s disgusting! Is it one hundred years old or what? - Why didn’t you say? - You didn’t ask, did you? So how’s the musical going? I don’t know what to expect from the casting. More dancing than singing? I really don’t know. I... I’m kind of scared. Come on, Dan, it’ll be fine. How do you approach a girl that you fancy? - I’m usually too scared to even try. - Well, same here. See you. That’s enough. Let’s go to work. - What kind of dessert have you got? - Mango ice-cream with chocolate. It’s delicious, madam. Two scoops then, or perhaps three. Dessert, now? Are you scared that someone might eat them all? Well, the best thing doesn’t always have to come at the end, does it? Well, I’d like that as well. It’s never too late. Perhaps I’m feeling great already. But not because of me, I guess. I don’t even know what a date is anymore, or if this is a date at all. I’m scared that it’ll always end badly. I also know this kind of fear, but it’s a long story. - I’d like to hear it though. - But I don’t want to talk about it. I understand. So why doesn’t Dan play music a lot more? He’s got no place to practise in the first place. I’ve just had an idea. Dad? The night has come and you’re so close to me. I know what you dream about, my love. You want to sleep. Your lips must be made of sweet roses. I want to kiss them, get to know their taste. To love! I love it when you wake up when the sun’s rising. I won’t make you get up, I know. Mornings can be heavy. I have breakfast alone. Mornings can be heavy, I know that thanks to you. I want to become your sleep like crazy. Let my breath become a breeze. Mornings can be heavy. Hello, Dad. Hi there. You just dash in like this after all those years? Do you even remember the last time you were here? And now this... I’ve got one granddaughter already, you know? I’m not saying we should adopt him, I just want to help him. Is it so hard to understand? I hear he’s got a pretty sister. I hope you’re not falling in love again, my boy. - Lenka didn’t teach you a lesson? - The doctor? It was just for fun. It’s a pity anyway. A doctor in the family is a blessing for an old person. I can see it all around now, the importance of care. So care, is it? And what about those old ladies swarming around you? Well, not all of them, but Magda, for instance... Magda, is it? And you want to lecture me? Well, I have an idea. I hope I won’t regret it for the rest of my life. Well, I thought you’d never come back again. So I redecorated it for Jitka a bit. And since she’s gone too... Do you remember how you broke this in a fit of anger? It was sad. I’m sorry about that, but don’t blame me. You nearly turned us into a criminal family. All I want is a second chance. That’s all. So I thought this could be a good place. What do you think? With a bit of work... - Dad? - Yes. I really like you. I’d like to live to the fullest to be sure, I’d like to rise and not stay at the bottom. To plant a tree in my soil, build a house and live in it. This is how I would love to live. I don’t want too much but also not too little. I want to live to the fullest to make it worthwhile. I want only what I can do myself, I hope I’m entitled to that, nothing more. This is how I’d love to live. This is how I’d love to live. How I’d love to live. Ouch... - Hi, Grandpa. - Hello... - What’s wrong? - Nothing, it’s alright. - Come on, let me take care of it. A piece of toilet paper should do the trick. How can you say such a thing to a nurse? - Come on, it’s in the kitchen. - Oh, those bloody genes! So, a strange boy is supposed to live in my room now, I hear. Not live, just play and sing. Because of a musical casting. - I see. - He’s said to sing really well. I hope you haven’t thrown away my teddy bears! I’d never do that. They’re in the wardrobe. Okay. This is what dad left for me at work. What is it? Have a look. Oh, I see. Put it in then. Do you remember how we danced to this together? My dad played my favourite song. Those were the days. We were so young. What do you mean? I’m still young! Wait, I’m curious about this. I thought my dad wasn’t there. Of course he was. But after the divorce, he wasn’t allowed to visit you. What could he do? He took pictures at least. Can you imagine how he must have felt? Hello, the door was open. I hope I’m not disturbing. I’ve come to help, but if this isn’t a good time... No, it’s fine, my name’s Jitka. I’m Dan, nice to meet you. Thanks for the room. It’s alright. Come on in. - So you sing, right? - Well, I do my best. - This is what I’m rehearsing these days. - Okay. - I see, it’s pretty good. - Thanks. So don’t forget to sign all these walls before you leave, because I’ll start showing it to tourists after you become famous. Okay, I will. So that’s all about our daughter companies. Thank you. I must admit you make me feel a bit nervous. I invite you somewhere... please. Thank you. And you just keep talking about work. So let’s get a move on. I hope you like bubbles. - Cheers. - Cheers. Thank you. You know, when I talked to you about dancing in the office the other day, I was wondering if you might... I mean if we could go out somewhere. Thank you, but I really don’t dance. I see. But if I came up with... Excuse me. I’m sorry, I have to take this. - Sure. - I’ll be back in a minute. - This is for you. - For me? Thank you. - Is there something wrong? - No, thanks. Just tell Mr Koukal... - In fact, don’t tell him anything. - Bye. - Goodbye. What’re you doing, you fools? What a pilot! Can’t you pull over properly? Stop staring. Viky, what do you actually do when you behave yourself? Me? I work and get paid for it. It’s a social experiment. It actually works from time to time. It’s a very bold experiment! So, my dear oranges, decide who's driving, I need to think something over. What’s this? Where are you running to? Hey, oranges, what’s the meaning of this! Hang on, we’ll be back in a minute. This is not a dance lesson! We serve the nation! Look, it’s Dan. He’s making eyes on you, but he’s staying with old Hovorka and dating his granddaughter. She’s called Jitka. They even have rehearsals there. I wonder what they “rehearse“. It’s hard to keep a secret here. Listen, people come here to dance for fun. I’m sorry, it’s my days, you see? You’ve been a bit annoying lately and you’re spoiling things for everyone else. So what? Are you going to kick me out? What’re you playing at? You don’t mind Robert’s old man’s - money that make all this work, do you? - Aneta! Leave me alone! You’re after Dan first, then after my Robert... You think you own the whole world? You’re fucking mistaken. Hi... So you swapped my phone number for a Jitka, right? - May I? I’m really good at this. - Thank you. Have you used any of those photos? There’re a lot of them in the file you stole from that bitch. - Look what I’ve done with it! - Great! I love you so much. Your business is doing fine, but you don’t seem happy at all. - It’s that woman, you see? - That head clerk of yours? - Yeah. - You haven’t screwed her yet? - I’ve got no idea how to do it. She’s like an ice queen. I’d give anything for that. - I don’t know you like this. - Neither do I. I’m like a teenager, I’m always thinking of her. Sorry. You see? No wonder. I have to take this, I’m sorry. And how about your dad? He’s fine, he wants to take Dan to Moravia. What, to Moravia? But the casting is the day after tomorrow, isn’t it? Don’t worry, they’ll make it. Dad just doesn’t want to go there alone. - A bit more wine? - No, I’ve got to go. - So how about a dessert? - Blimey! You should have been a pastry baker, I’ve always wanted one. Well, I might become a pastry baker in the end. - What am I doing wrong? - You? You nothing, I’m sorry. I just need to get some mess out of my head. It looks like we’re going hunting! Where did you steal it? Get on board! I’m sorry, I got delayed because of the flowers. I apologize. It’s so timeless here. That’s why I love stones. I take them to my parents sometimes. Small stones. They’re here forever. Just like angels. Flowers die straight away. Yeap... Just about to fly. Don’t fool yourself, if this one is local, it surely is no angel. Take a seat, please. My dear Jan, are you my nephew or my cousin? I still can’t remember. I’m your cousin. Once removed, true, but still your cousin. Thank you for bidding Ondřej farewell in such a lovely way. It was beautiful... if funerals can be beautiful at all. Everyone leaves behind someone, and if it hadn’t been for you, Magda, there would have been no farewell at all. And if it hadn’t been for you, I wouldn’t have learnt about it. Ondřej decided to live alone, but it was partly my fault, as you very well know, so with this I could at least... - Pay your debt. - Yes, pay my debt. And that’s very important. Well, we all need to depart along our own road from this world, and we should do so as better people, Magda. And I’m sure if we taste all that your holy wine cellar can offer, I’ll personally leave as a much, much better person! - Good. I agree. - Can I help you? You’re most kind, come along. And we’ll start tasting in the meantime. It’s Jan’s very own recipes, I guess. Herbal liqueur, isn’t it? What’s in it? Mint and sagebrush, it’s nicely bitter. Elderberry. Yes, elderberry flower, too. Yes, true. - And sage. - No, not sage. - No sage? Only love, a lovely story can give us both what we need, but you really have to wish that. Only love, a lovely story, may it be real, not just a dream, only that can save us. Only that can save us. Only that can save us. You lost someone dear to you as well, didn’t you? Yes, it’s been a long time, but it still hurts sometimes. And do you know what’s even worse? If you lose someone just because you’re scared to tell them that you like them. What, you and scared of anything? Well, it just happened out of the blue, you know what I mean. I was really scared of it. And I knew I stood no chance. But all the more so I was in love. And who was it? Unless it’s a secret, of course. It is a secret, but... You must be... Really? Well, now I understand. But you could at least have tried. It was impossible, the circumstances were most unfavourable. I’m sorry, friends, but the youngsters are nowhere to be seen. It’s alright. Do you know what I wish now? To meet him one more time and admit it all, to tell him everything to achieve closure, so to speak. To bury him too, in a way. Well, that’s very bold, bold indeed. Jan, you don’t know what this is about, but you’re absolutely right, nonetheless. It’s not over yet. - God only knows... - Oh, rubbish! Jesus, the casting! We’ve got to go to Pilsen at once. Calm down, all roads lead to Pilsen, isn’t that so, father? I know a different version of this saying, but we had different teachers, I guess. But we must be on our way, you see? We’ve got to go immediately. But you can’t drive in this state. Jan, you’re the one in charge of miracles, aren’t you? Well, with God’s help... Only love, a lovely story can give us both what we need, but you really have to wish that. Only love, a lovely story may it be real, not just a dream, only that can save us. - Great, we’re looking forward to you! - Thank you very much, goodbye. Hello, I’ll sing ”Love” for you from The Three Musketeers. So you want one of the leading parts, right? Playback, please. Dear friend, I know the scent of women too, you’re not alone in this. I’d live for love day and night. May the devil take me! I wanted to dream a beautiful dream with her. I held a snake to my breast and then stood there humiliated. - May the devil take me! - That’s enough. Thank you, see you at the first rehearsal. Thanks a lot! So? You’ve got it? Congratulations! - I could do with coffee now. - What a great idea. - I think I’ll have a shot. - Yeah. Hi, Lenka. What have you got here? What’s the meaning of this? Is this real? - Of course not, it’s fake! - Someone should pay for this then. - Betka, wait, wait! - Leave me alone. - Wait! Hi, Viky, are you still friends with Imperio? Can you check out Betka’s new profile? I need to know who did it to her, right now! Only the stony pavement might feel what I feel. Only the cobblestones know how I’m trampled on. All that matters to me someone wants to destroy. How can I live with this? That my soul is backstabbed! Such an evil lie! I fight in vain the fact I’m the only one who knows the truth. Only me and my spleen. Only me and my spleen. - Hi. - Hello. I thought you stopped doing this ages ago. I do it only form time to time now, when someone needs my help. - Okay. - But I still love it. So how is it going? Hang on... It’s coming up. So they fed the website from this IP address. But we need a physical address, you see? - No problem, look at this. - Oh man, what is it? It’s a localizer. It’ll be a minute. Here we go. That’s it. 30 Mánesova Street. It’s a large complex of buildings. Does it ring a bell? - Sure, it’s Koukal Junior’s place. - I see. Okay, so let’s have a look then. We’ll check his IT kit. I’m sure we’ll find something there. Voila. Here we go. His web camera was on. So what do we do now? You know the saying, “What goes around comes around“? - Yes, I do. - So wait and see. The Empire Strikes Back. Oh, oh, oh, decibels of love. Oh, oh, oh, that’s what it is. You’re really great! And now the final song. ”They All Want to Have You, Love.” I met a special one... It was outside in the rain! She was standing there in her T-shirt. I gave her my umbrella! So she didn’t get wet even more. Because rain washes beauty off! I found a treasure in her. And she found salvation in me! I know now it wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t had my umbrella. I was really lucky that I hadn’t taken the tram. I might have sensed something, it was supposed to be like that, I did what was right and proper, so I told her to come along. They all want to have you, love when we walk through the streets of Prague to our place. I know they all want to have you. I love being alone with you. They all want to have you, love when we walk to our place. I know they all want to have you. I love being alone with you. They all want to have you. Come on, punctuality is the virtue of kings! We’ve got a lot of work today. I love you. Here’s the latest news: The websites of the Municipal Office and other places around the city have been hacked, including popular disco club Pantheon, the local casino and the branch of the city’s largest bank. According to the latest information no financial damage has been caused, but the following photographs and videos have been put on all the websites concerned and cannot as yet be removed. That’s all from our reporter in the field. The main target of the attack seems to be the son of successful local entrepreneur Tomáš Koukal... And this is my notice. Sign it down here, please. Okay, let’s go. Ready? Five, six, seven, eight! - Do something! - But what? - You know what! You can’t keep doing this to her. Try this. Watch. - Hello there. - Good evening. Are you alone? You’ll see! So here he is! No, no, no. Wait, wait! No, it’s not him. He was much younger. I mean I was much younger. - You don’t recognize me? - I do, actually. I just want to tell you that back then I was too shy to tell you... I’m the same in this respect. It’s been so long, hasn’t it? Yeah. - I wanted to tell you the same back then. - But it’s too late now. Not at all. Now our time has finally come. Now I mostly see you wearing glasses as days pass by. Last year’s snow once so white is now of greyish hue. So don’t worry about years of ripeness. Let the young ones break things down. Hundreds of sweet women are on offer. - Your certificate... - ...is the spirit under this coat. And you can bet on it. Growing old is tricky, but it can be handled with ease if you don’t take your age seriously at all. Even if your hair is thin, make sure to flap your wings, and live to the fullest even in your ripe old age. Not until you grow old do you know what life’s about and you’re in black numbers at last, your life becomes as easy as the face of Mona Lisa, so live and get to know life. Dad, here you are. I’ve been looking for you everywhere! - I’m sorry. - Otherwise we won’t make it. - Yes. Yes, but... but. Karel? - Bye. - I’m looking forward to tomorrow. We’re often at crossroads not knowing what to do. Even if your life hanged by a thread, you could still count on love, I know, that’s what people say. And even if your memories are lovely, they do fade away in no time. What can one do? What can one do? I really don’t know. Dad? I like you so much. Me too. "...love in all its forms gives us wings. It provides us with supernatural powers with which can win even the hardest battle." I have a gold-plated coffin and a faded blossom at my legs. And a tombstone saying that the world has buried me. I like singing even in the dark when there’s a blackout. Come and listen to my duet with a howling wind. I’ve been buried a hundred times and a hundred times I have risen. And if there’re still songs to sing, I’ll keep singing on and on.
