[BIRDS CHIRPING] [WATER DRIPPING] JOHN [WHISPERING]: Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is great. This is cool. [NUCLEAR FAMILY THEME SONG PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, kiddo, come on. It's nice here. Can we stay one more night? You know the answer to that. Come on. - Now. - Fine. You know, this is all we have left. [SIGHS] I know our situation, tsk. [GRUNTS] Here, Mom. JOHN: Once we make it to the coast, we'll find a boat, sail away. PAULINE: And I'll have my own room? They're not called rooms on a boat. They're called berths. - Like a baby birth? - Yeah. No, they're spelled differently. The ship one has an E instead of an I. JOHN: Like it matters. Does it not? When did it stop mattering? PAULINE: So I'll have my own berth. JOHN: That's right. Or you can share with your brother. PAULINE: Then we'll sail away. - That's the idea. [WOMAN SCREAMS] - Get down now, now. WOMAN: Stay back, stay back! MAN 1: Oh, come on. MAN 2: Oh, oh, oh. MAN 1: Come on. WOMAN: Go away. WOMAN: Stay back. MAN 1: Come on. WOMAN: Oh! MAN 1: Here, kitty, kitty. Oh, Christ. WOMAN: Oh, no! MAN 2: "Oh, no," yeah! MAN 2: Yeah! WOMAN: No! MAN 3: Swing that stick, baby. - They'll kill her. LYNN: Shh, keep your voice down, sweetie. - Do something. - Pauline, now quiet. We'll save her, yes. Move back up over the ridge and keep moving. - They're murdering her. - Shh. Pauline, no. You want to let them kill us too? - Enough. WOMAN: Please! WOMAN: No, no! MAN 2: Oh! JOHN: Go. Go, go, go, move it. Hustle. - Hustle. - Wait, stop. We're doing more than leaving her. Oh, what I want? You know what we agreed to? It's the smartest, safest thing, yes. That's not an answer. I just-- You know what? There are two types of people in this world. Those that do evil and those that-- Stand by while the evil is being done, I told you that. Are you serious right now? You want me to risk everything to go save a woman that's gonna be dead by the time I do. [MEN LAUGHING] This is so unbelievable. Unbelievable. [WOMAN SCREAMING] MAN 1: Come on, let's go! [WOMAN SCREAMING] MAN 2: Oh, okay. [GRUNTS] [GUN CLICKS] MAN 2: Hey, baby. MAN 3: Okay, I got it, man. MAN 2: Why don't we go? Come on. MAN 1: Oh, my God. [MAN 2 SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] [LYNN GASPS] [GUN CLICKS] MAN 2: What the fuck? [GROANS] [MAN 2 GRUNTS] John. MAN 1: Come on, come on. MAN 1: Come on, come on, come on. [GRUNTS] MAN 3: Wait, man, wait, I didn't even-- [GRUNTS] Okay, now come on. [JOHN PANTING] Jesus. - Is she dead? JOHN: Yeah. [PANTING] [MAN 1 COUGHS] JOHN: Come on, come here. MAN 1: Oh, God... JOHN: Come on, tough guy. [MAN 1 GROANS] [JOHN GRUNTS] Jesus, John. You wanna get involved? This is what it's like to get involved. All right, check their pockets. You know what to do. Let's go. Let's go, in case there's more. Come on, Pauline. He's not gonna bite you. JOHN: What size of shoe you wear? Do you wear an eight? - Baby, can you wear an eight? - And tomatoes. I found soup, I found a can opener. Can you wear an eight? Yeah, I can wear an eight. Okay, we'll keep them. Good find on the food. [JOHN PANTING] PAULINE: Hey, Dad? JOHN: Oh, that's great. Great find, great find, sweetie. Great find, great find, yeah. JOHN: Right, oh. [BIRDS CHIRPING] LYNN: We came in to the house, because Tiffany was going insane. Now the hills are going insane. It's gonna get worse. We don't show Grant's picture to anyone, anymore, you know? Well, who are we gonna show it to, huh? The Berserkers who killed that lady? Hmm. [SIGHS] There's no one like us left. I still feel him. I do. - Yeah. - He's out there. [JOHN SIGHS] I know it. Hey, I gotta take a piss, okay? Up, up, come on. I'll just be over there. LYNN: All right. [SIGHS] - John? - I'm fine with that. LAWYER 1: Okay, finally, "Both parties agree to keep the details of the dissolution private and confidential." Okay, the only thing that caught my eye was Provision 17. LAWYER 1: Is that the custody arrangement? Uh, no, that's fine. It was, uh, future earnings... The unemployment clause. No, I totally forgot it. Excuse me. LAWYER 2: Not a problem, oh... We still need to talk about the pension fund. LYNN: Hey, Grant, what did I tell you...? LAWYER 2: We will need a QDRO order from the court, uh, so that we can divide up the 401K, tax-free. LAWYER 1: You said you were gonna do that, so I'll let you do that, and I'll insert the unemployment clause. LAWYER 2: All right. LAWYER 1: All right, I can turn these changes around 24 hours... - Everything okay? - Yeah. LAWYER 2: So we could still, uh, sign today if it's understood by both parties that the future earnings are gonna be-- [BOMB EXPLODES] LAWYER 1: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [CAR ALARMS BLARING] LAWYER 1: Oh, my God. LYNN: What the hell is that? - Mom? LAWYER 1: Oh, my God. LAWYER 1: I'm calling my wife. - I don't know what's happening. - Come on, let's go. Let's go. [LYNN MUMBLING] Lynn? Come on. LYNN: Okay, come on, go. [SIRENS BLARING] [GROUND RUMBLES] [DOG BARKS] [JOHN SIGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [FOOTSTEPS] - Ugh. - Don't move. I don't wanna hurt you. Made short work of those three men today. You can fight. I'm gonna take this knife away. - Yeah. - And I don't want-- [LYNN GRUNTS] Holy shit. [LYNN PANTING] - Nice hit, honey. - Oh, thanks. Wait, wait, wait, don't-- Don't hurt him. What did he say to you? I didn't hear him, I was busy thinking about the knife against my throat. I know, that's... That's why I hit him. Come on. No, but didn't he-- - Didn't he sound normal to you? - Normal. Like, he wasn't crazy. JOHN: Yeah. LYNN: Oh... Hey. JOHN: Jesus. - Don't hurt him, okay? You were following us? Why? Look at me. I'm the one with the gun and the questions. I saw you help that woman. I hadn't seen anyone help anyone in a long time. Oh, and that gets me your blade against my throat, huh? I didn't know what to expect. I just wanted to talk. There's some men, some... There are some wild crazy men, freaks. - Berserkers. JOHN: Quiet, honey. That's good, that's a good word for them, Berserkers. They have my wife. And there's too many of them for me to handle all by myself. I can't help you. I got my own to worry about. But you did today. You helped that woman. Yeah, helping that lady was dumb. The only reason why I survived that was because of the too old shotgun shell. Have you seen this boy? Hey, what are you doing, huh? We agreed that I would take care of this. All right, just get back. - They have him too. - No, they don't. You've seen my son? Yeah, he's seen the Pope if he gets us to help him. I swear to God. LYNN: Oh, stop. That just caused us a shell I wasn't even gonna shoot. - He has seen Grant! - He hasn't seen him! I'm not lying! I saw them, the whole gang. They walked by me, close. Your son, he... He's got longer hair now, and he wears a yellow shirt, uh, with a number on it. I was a detective in my old country. I... I was trained to pay attention to detail. They have your son. I apologize. No need. How much further is it? THE AFRICAN: I'm not really sure. Maybe three, four miles. Did you know that, um, a room on a boat is a berth? But we're gonna find Grant, and then we'll find a boat, and we'll sail away. You have a getaway plan? That's enough, Pauline. For the longest time, I thought the governor would come and help us. I really thought they would. Now I don't know if anyone is alive. That's a scary thing for a little girl, I know. I can take it. We got to get going. Unh, start getting ready. THE AFRICAN: You all heard the rumors? What rumors? That there are people, normal people, that are trying to rebuild society. Tent City, commune. LYNN: What? - Normal people. LYNN: Where? I don't know. Nearby, maybe even up in these hills. How many of them are there? Hey, it's just a rumor, sweetie. Nothing more. How do you know? Because we've been over these hills, and we haven't found shit. It's a fairy tale to give people false hope. It's bullshit. [CLANGS] What is that? [CLANGING] [BERSERKERS CHEERING] That's your people. That's your Berserkers right there. That's your Berserkers. What are they doing? Let's get to higher ground, get a better view. [BERSERKERS CHEERING] Good God. - Do you see him? - No. You need to be down there. I haven't seen these many people in one place in a long time. That's what they do all day. Fight, act wild, hurt their captives. What's the best way in? I'm sorry. - What? - These men are demons. We don't have much of a choice. Both of us have family down there. No. No, we have to get back. Um... I got to talk to you. What the hell is there to talk about? LYNN: John. THE SON: Put the gun down. Come on. THE AFRICAN: Where is my wife? Where is she? Oh, yeah, she's back at camp. Uh, you should come with us if you wanna hang out. - No, listen, I did my part. LYNN: Oh, please... Where is she? [LYNN GASPS] I could kill you now, that would make you a little happier. You should let him, because if I get a chance, I'm gonna cut your heart out and feed it to you. Look at this guy, huh? You got some fire left in you. Feisty, I love that. I feel like we all pretty much love that around here. Unh... MAN [ON RADIO]: We don't know the extent of the damage. Uh, both FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security are advising that you stay in your homes. - Frankly, we don't know... JOHN: Yeah, right. Who do they expect to come? - I don't get it. GRANT: Dad. MAN [ON RADIO]: ...in your home. please. JOHN: Look at this jackass. [CAR HORNS HONKING] LYNN: Can he get around us? - Of course not, he's an idiot. - I'm sorry, babe, I'm... - He can't get past us. I'm gonna go check it out, okay? Maybe it's an engine problem. - Honey, just stay in the car? GRANT: Dad. - That's one thing I know about. LYNN: Wait, John. JOHN: I'll be right back. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] WOMAN: You're not getting in there. MAN: Just fixing it, ma'am. WOMAN: Leave me alone. MAN: I got this handled. Listen, you know what? You just go get in your car and settle down, okay? JOHN: I know some about engines, won't you just, uh-- Okay, man, three hours later. Thank you, I appreciate that, Captain America. You go deal with something else. JOHN: Jesus Christ, lady. PAULINE: Mom? What the hell are you doing? GRANT: Sofie! LYNN: Grant, stay in the car. Grant? Goddamn it. Pauline, stay in the car. Grant! Grant, where are you? Grant! Grant? [BERSERKERS CHEERING] [JOHN COUGHS] BERSERKER 1: Oh, yeah! That's the way to die, yeah! [BERSERKER 1 GRUNTS] BERSERKER 1: Yeah, come on! Oh, yeah! Come on, honey, we can do this! God, you look... Guess what? [JOHN GROANING] BERSERKER 1: Ha-ha-ha, yeah, come on! Yes! [JOHN GROANS] [BERSERKERS CHEERING] BERSERKER 1: Yeah! Yeah! [JOHN GROANS] BERSERKER 1: All right, yeah! Yeah, that's the way do it! Yeah! Come on! Come on, yeah! Come on! [GRUNTING] Come on, yeah! Come on. Come on! Yeah! [GRUNTING] [BERSERKER 1 GASPS] Where's my family? Show me my family! I'm not fucking around! I'll chop his head off! What did you do with my family? [PANTING] [GASPS] JOHN: Fuck. JOHN: Fuck. Come on. [GRUNTING] [JOHN GROANING] Come on, get the bat! Come on! Come on, hit me! Pick it up and hit me! Come on! Come on! [JOHN GRUNTS] JOHN: Oh, my God, unh! [JOHN GROANS] Yeah! [BERSERKERS CHEERING] BERSERKER 2: Oh, you wanna see him die? Yeah! Yeah! Come on! Ready to die, little man? Are you ready to die? [BERSERKER 2 GRUNTS] [BERSERKER 2 GROANS] [BERSERKERS JEER] BERSERKER 3: Come on! Yeah! He's all right, yeah! Come on, get up! [GRUNTING] Jesus. [GASPS] John, sorry. - You son of a bitch. - Sorry. [GRUNTING] I know what I've done, John. I'm-- They killed my wife right in front of me! JOHN: Good! Where are Lynn and Pauline? Where are they? They've taken them into their leader's tent. You son of a-- [JOHN PANTING] Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God. Oh... Oh, my God. He was here, John. That much was true. [GRUNTS] THE MAN: Easy, easy. Oh, my... Are you all right? My men can be so brutal. I guess you already know that, don't you? I hear you dispatched three of them the other day. That's why I brought you here. - Unh, Lynn. THE MAN: Whoa. LYNN: John. That was stupid. [GRUNTING] Your first instinct must be to try to talk to them as equals. But the average person's an idiot. They probably just think a bomb went off. They don't know the real story. So why would you do that? Where's my son, huh? I found his shirt. Where is he? What did you do with him? Mister, a lot of people come in and out of this place. Mostly in, not very much out, because they're weak, and they don't listen. [GROANS] Now I brought you here so you can talk some sense into your wife. Somebody has to make her understand that I will kill you if I don't get what I want. What? And I want it nice. I'm not an animal. Out there, there are animals. So I want you to tell her to give me what I want without a fight. [MOANS] You understand, don't you? [JOHN GRUNTS] [THE MAN GROANING] [GRUNTS] THE MAN: Oh, God. Please, don't hit my dad anymore, John. THE MAN: No, no! Oh, back off. See, I understand the urge to hit back. And we could just keep doing that. But I think I'm just gonna walk over and hit his wife instead. That will make him hurt more. Unh, don't touch her! PAULINE: Mom? [CRYING] You like hitting women and children, you sick fuck? Yes, actually. One of my favorite pastimes. You're on the losing side, man, huh? There's no more room in the world for heroics. Come on, why don't you just join me here? - Go to hell. - No, you first. Throw him back in the ring. [JOHN GRUNTS] Finally. [GRUNTING] Come on, dears. Let's go watch Daddy die. [BERSERKERS CHEERING] THE AFRICAN: Come on! [PANTING] Get up! This is what you wanted! A chance to kill me! You're not my priority anymore. But they're expecting a show! - Huh? - Unh! [GRUNTS] Oh... John? [JOHN GASPING] I'm giving you one chance, John. [JOHN GRUNTS] Promise me you'll make it count. [GASPING] [JOHN SIGHS] [LYNN GRUNTS] [THE MAN LAUGHING] Nice move, man. - Ha, ha, nice. - Tell them to back off. Back off! Back off! Drop the gun, dummy. We own these hills, you know. You're not gonna get far. Oh, we'll see about that, huh? - Anybody follows me...! - Yeah, back off! You get his brains all over you! Brains all over you! Give up now, and I'll kill you straight away, quick and painless, even the little girl. - Pauline, over here. - They won't touch her. Get over here, come here. Oh, yes, I'm sure they're coming. They're coming. I want you to take her over to that ridge as fast as you can, I'll catch up. - What about you? - I wanna give us-- Remember this moment. It's where it all went horribly wrong. - Where is my son? - Your son? I don't know. I must have misplaced him. Some old things get lost, but then, you know that, don't you? You're the mother who lost her own child. You son of a bitch. - You son of a bitch! - Ha-ha-ha. JOHN: Don't listen to this freak show! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Get going! I'll catch up with you. I wanna give you some distance! Go! THE MAN: Take one long last look at your family. We will find them. We will find you. We'll find you! [LAUGHS] - Kneel down. - What? - Kneel the fuck down! - No, no, no. [GROANS] [LAUGHS] Come on. I'm gonna give you one last chance. Where's my son? - Your son? - Grant! Grant? Why didn't you say so? I remember him. He was delicious. [GASPS] You... You know how bad you think I am? How evil? You pull that trigger, and you'll never know where your son really is. [CHUCKLING] Thank you for your support, Leslie. LESLIE: Oh, wow. - Thank you. - Yes. Oh, all right. - All right. - I'm Clay. You know what? I just think you're awesome. Ha, ha, no, Clay. You are the awesome one. Remember, the power is in you. Now, move, please. There are people behind you. Jesus. [CLEARS THROAT] - Well, who do we have here? - A new fan. I'm buying copies for my girlfriends. Oh. I'm really impressed by you, what you have to say. If my books can help just one person, it's all worth it. [GRUNTING] Yes, easy, easy. Who do you think I am, Secretariat? Oh, no, sorry, feeling a little carried away there. [BOMB EXPLODES] GIRL: God, is that what I think it is? Get off me. Here we go. [PHONE BEEPING] Are we under attack? - Why are you still in my car? - What? Get out! [PHONE RINGING] [PHONE BEEPS] - What's up, Dad? - Did you see it? THE SON [ON THE PHONE]: What? Oh, the explosion, dumbass. It's beginning. What...? What's beginning, Dad? THE MAN: The end of the world, like I predicted. It's beginning. Our time, our shot. What...? What? - What exploded? - Something big. Something that's gonna change the game. I can feel it. Now, look, you get together all of our camping gear. Then run down to the market, you buy all the canned goods and bottled water you can carry. - Right now, Dad? THE MAN: Yes, now. What are you, high or retarded? Yes, now. Christ, how did I ever get saddled with somebody like you? THE SON: Dad? - What's that? Hello? He-- Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad, we're coming for you! BERSERKER 1: Looks like somebody knelt here, and somebody stood over there, and then continued up the ridge. Well, then we know where we're going, don't we? BERSERKER 2: Got a hunting party out, they're gonna wonder where we've gone. Head back to camp and wait for them. The rest of you, come with me. Stop, stop, stop. Here. - Will Dad kill that man? - I don't know, sweetie. Did that man hurt Grant? Pauline, I know as much as you do. [CRIES] Hey, hey. [SOBBING] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so scared. I know, me too. Okay, can you do something for me? - Can you keep being strong? - I can't. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. I can't. Pauline, we are gonna get through this. You hear me? Together. All the way to our boat? [SIGHS] All the way to our boat. Okay? Okay. [PAULINE CRYING] [THE MAN GRUNTS] Get the lead out. Hey, I'm in flat shoes, you animal. I told you where your little bastard is. - What more do you want from me? - Insurance. You think I'm lying? Why would I do that? To buy yourself more time, because I was about to blow your head off. LYNN: John. Do we need him with us? He's our only leverage if the others catch up. JOHN: Hey. - Easy, easy, easy. THE MAN: It's a map, all right. There, see? Right there, that's where you need to go. Tent City, that's where your boy is. And there's no reason to drag me along with you. They traded Grant and some other kids to the people. - They've traded them. - Well... What are these, uh... What are these areas that have been erased, huh? What's that? They're transient. The city moves around a lot. This jagged line, runs around the whole area? Have a seat, I'll give a lesson in cartography. Why don't you just answer my questions? Cover him. You're gonna show us exactly where Tent City is. Oh, no, I can't go with you there. They'll kill me on sight. You're a popular guy. Yeah, well, I'm serious. They'll gun me down. It's just a chance we're gonna have to take. Look at that, a little light reading for you, huh? Okay, Pauline, take his knife. PAULINE: Okay. - Hang on to it. Once I get him tied up, we'll just take him to the top of that hill up there. - Wait for me. - Where are you going? Gonna find a trail down there, drop his stuff on it, try to throw them off. John, is this the best idea? Yeah, we gotta try and confuse them. No, this, him, getting more involved. We finally got a lead on Grant, babe. We don't have a lead. We have a shirt. You got a better idea? You want me to kill him now? I'll kill him. We can go on and head to the coast. THE SON: Dad! Yeah, there are my boys. - Dad! - They're coming, go. Oh, my boys, here they come. They're coming to get me. - Ha-ha-ha. - We don't care. THE MAN: I'll see you, huh? LYNN: Move. [DOG BARKING] You say you traded my son. Like a very small card. Three kids got me two scrawny ass chickens. [LAUGHS] The people in Tent City, why do they want children? A stew? Who in the hell knows? Ah, but it's a fine day for a walk, isn't it? Even if it is bit cool. Well, I feel sorry for little Grant, you know, being out there, naked from the waist up. [LYNN GRUNTS] [THE MAN LAUGHS] Don't mistake me for the weaker one. I asked you a question. What did they want with my son? My scout said that they were trading food for kids, some delusion about saving them. PAULINE: Mom. [DOG BARKS] THE MAN: Ha-ha-ha, oh, lookie. I've got more men. [GASPS] THE MAN: I told you, we own these hills. - They'll run right into Dad. - Shh. Oh, honey, you're in trouble now. [LAUGHS] [DOG HOWLS] REBAR: What the fuck is that guy's name? Lloyd, Floyd? What is his fucking name? [REBAR LAUGHS] He got on his goddamn body armor. He's got his body armor on. Made in Mexico, dude. What the fuck happened here? BERSERKER 1: What happened...? REBAR: Oh, what's this? REBAR: Look at this. Can you...? - Hey, it's The Man's. REBAR: Let me see. Sure as shit. Spread out. See what else you can find. [JOHN GRUNTS] [BERSERKER GROANING] THE SON: Rebar! Good thing we caught up with you. Dad's been taken hostage. Or killed and hacked to bits. That's his stuff strewn all over the place. No, these people don't have the stomach for that. They can't be far. Fall in behind me. We'll hunt them down. Follow you? Now just because the Man's gone does not make you in charge. We don't have time for this. It's gonna be getting dark-- Your father said, "Only the strong will make it." Don't talk about him like he's dead. This is gonna end two ways. Either you shut up and get back to camp or you challenge me here. [BERSERKERS LAUGHING] [BERSERKERS CHEER] REBAR: Huh? I'll take that as a yes. [LAUGHS] Your pop always said you was borderline retard. Give up your weapon like I did. Attaboy. Just like that. Hand him your gun. You lower that goddamn gun. You fight me like a-- God, you little shit. REBAR: You little-- [GUN FIRES] THE SON: Any more leaders? No? Let's go. Unh... It will be getting dark soon. JOHN: Well, we can rest here. - No need. It's close by. All we have to do is follow this creek up to that ridge. It's on the other side. Earlier, you said something about that explosion being more than just a bomb. - Uh-huh. - What do you mean by that, huh? Oh, I meant you're a big jackhole. You know, there's another way we can play this, right? [LAUGHS] Yeah, haven't you ever wondered why we're not all sick? Dying of radiation? How we can still drink the water? How did things get this primitive, this fast? The machines don't work. Engines, communication, huh? Well, a nuke gives off an electromagnetic pulse that would shut all that down. Oh, maybe you're not a total dumbass after all. But did you also know that our military has the technology to beam a man-made pulse onto an area using satellites, and it can have all the earmarks of a nuke? It could smell like a nuke, could look like a nuke and feel like a nuke, but it ain't a nuke. Why would they do that on our own soil? Well, you can find out the truth about that or you can have your son back. You can't have both. - We'll take our son. THE MAN: Good choice. Good choice, excellent choice. - Decisive lady. - Walk. How do we know the rest of the world isn't okay? Normal even? Then you think there would be planes or choppers, you know, maybe dropping in supplies. Or what if the whole area has been deemed a no-fly zone? Just keep moving. Maybe everybody's been told that the nuke did go off, and the whole place is radioactive with no survivors, huh? That's rhetorical, by the way. As you can see the answer right up there. THE MAN: Pretty impressive, huh? - What is this? - The big picture. Class dismissed, ha, ha. You know that jagged line you asked me about on the map? It's this fence. The one they built to keep us caged in. That sound you hear is your mind exploding. Yeah, and my son? Tent City, where is it? Oh, man, ha, ha. You don't drop anything, do you? A dog with a bone. I told you, I go there, they'll kill me there. Yeah, I'll kill you right here. No, ha, ha. Because we already tripped the motion sensors. They'll be here soon. Who's gonna be here? MAN 1: Lower the gun! Oh, thank God, this man killed my wife and child! - Lower the gun! JOHN: Bullshit, he's lying! He killed them in cold blood, I'm telling you! - Drop your weapon! JOHN: It's not true! - He kidnapped my son! - Not gonna tell you again! He's my prisoner! Unh. LYNN: John, John! JOHN: Unh. Pauline, run, baby, run. [DART GUN COCKS] [DART GUN FIRES] MAN 1: Get that kid! THE MAN: Oh, God, thank God. - Get on your knees. THE MAN: Thank God. THE MAN: Oh, my God, I'm-- MAN 1: Shut up! THE MAN: Thank God. [PAULINE PANTING] [DART GUN FIRES] [DART GUN FIRES] [DART GUN FIRES] [DART GUN CLICKS] [DART GUN COCKS] [DART GUN CLICKS] MAN 2: I'm not gonna hurt you. Easy now. MAN 2: No... [BODY THUMPS] [MAN GROANING] [LYNN GASPING] [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] [LYNN GASPS] Who are you? Who are you? WOMAN 1: Subject 35 is conscious now. MAN 1: I want a full spectrum scan on her. WOMAN 1: Copy that. LYNN: Where am I? [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] - Have you seen this woman? - No. - Does she look familiar? - No. - Do you recognize her? - No. LYNN: Where are we? What are you...? [LYNN CRYING] WOMAN 2: Oh, a little help please. MAN 2: Why is this arm not secured? WOMAN 2: Good help is hard to find. JOHN: Leave her alone. - John. MAN 3: Oh, he's waking up too. JOHN: Unh... - John? LYNN: John. JOHN: Babe. WOMAN 2: Would you sedate him until we're ready for him? - God... JOHN: What is this place? WOMAN 2: Can we get some more hands on deck? MAN 3: Have you seen this woman? [INDISTINCT DIALOGUE] Well, what do you know? MAN 4: Hey, don't touch those. Backwards from the desk. That map's all wrong, you know? That Indian reservation's more to the southwest. And that old mill, in what used to be Clairfield, burned down to the ground last week. I saw it. You got to update that shit. Why is this subject in my office? He positively identified the photograph, sir. Yes, yes, yes, the lady in your photograph. I know where she is. Where? No, if I tell you that, I'll no longer be of any use to you. - Ha-ha-ha. - You think I'm stupid? - Ha-ha-ha. - We have protocols for uncooperative subjects, get him out. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Oh, your protocol won't work on me. Ha-ha. No matter what the hell it is. What, do you want her killed? Is that it? Or you want her brought in? Because I can have her here in 24 hours. Wait. Give us a minute. [LAUGHS] [BIRD CAWING] [GASPS] Any idiot can see that we've been exposed to something. Something you'd rather not be. Ha-ha. And from the looks of that outfit, it's airborne. Chemical maybe? If you have a point, get to it. I'm a man who gets things done inside the fence, all right? I know the lay of the land. I know all the players involved. I know the currency of the realm. So you know where the bodies are buried. That's good. Is that a real saying? I hope to steal that. Ha, ha. How do you know her? Uh... Yeah, these my chickens? Hey, feels a little light. Huh? - All right? - It's a pleasure to meet you. I have no idea why you want him but I'll keep bringing them to you. Because they're innocent and they deserve better. And if I find out that you have harmed them in any way this deal is off. Well, now, I'm gonna have to think about that. I mean, a man has certain needs. Yeah. - No, no, no. - Oh, my God. Pig. MAN: Hey. Hello. I said, how do you know her? We've done some business together. Some of it, unfinished. What are you proposing exactly? She's the leader of a settlement called Tent City, all right? Very well organized, smart, they have their own militia. You send your boys in these clumsy Hazmat outfits in there, they're not gonna come back. But I'm the leader of a group of men that I've been training. We're gonna go in there and get her and bring her back. - We need her alive. - Whatever. - What do you get out of this? - The joy of serving my country. Guns and ammo. As much as my men can carry out of here. Oh, one other thing. You know that crazy psychopath you brought me in here with? Huh? That guy. You wanna know about her? You run your protocol on him. [MUTTERING] WOMAN: Have you got a reading? MAN: Yeah, it's weak but it's registering. - Females have less, generally. - We haven't done anything. - Why is that? - Because men are more violent. It shows up more in their system. Lieutenant wants this group tagged and released. I'll take this one out myself. Wait a goddamn minute. I was told that I would have time with the subject. I'm following orders. How does anyone expect me to collect any data? John, what are you doing? John. Where are you taking my husband? WOMAN: We just got this green thing. I can't believe this. Why are you so surprised that research takes a back seat? - I'm filing a complaint. LYNN: No. WOMAN: I can't work like this. LYNN: Please. [CRYING] [DOOR CREAKS] Hello. [GASPS] [SIGHS] Get out of here. - They're coming right back - I got a knife. He's gonna kill you. Get out of here. Put the gas mask back in right now - Huh. - Oh, my, he's here. Hurry. Put the gag back. Go hide. Run. [DOOR CREAKS] JOHN: Wait. Care to revise your answer? Please. I don't know her. This will go quicker if you do. Give me back my wife. What are you doing? What are you doing? WOMAN [ON PA SYSTEM]: Standby at the north gate. Detainee transfer is programmed-- Stay together. Hey, are they putting us back outside? I don't know. Where are you taking us? Outside the fence, you'll find a table with canned provisions. You got one minute to collect as much food as you can. One at the time, people. Where is my husband? [COUGHS] We need the location of this woman. I don't know. Listen, somebody told you that I know stuff I don't know. I don't know her. Hey, this guy was infantry. MAN: Be careful. Get on with it. Bravo company. Like you and me. Can you do your job or not? WOMAN: Do not take more than you can carry. What is this place? Why won't you help us? [GRUNTS] Do not come back here. Stay away from the fence. Spread the word. I want an answer from you. Where is my husband? Let's go. If you try and come back to this place, you will not get any more food. Remember that. Instead you will be considered as rats to be fired at-- [GRUNTS] WOMAN [ON PA SYSTEM]: Breach at fourth gate. - What are you doing? - You've been compromised. Too early. I have my helmet on. I gotta-- I better ask the doc. I am the doc. Let me in. - Let me through. - You don't. - Get off me. - Let me in, goddamn it! [MACHINE GUN FIRES] WOMAN [ON PA SYSTEM]: Breach of north gate. Don't. [HUMMING] [GRUNTING] [CHUCKLES] [GRUNTING] [MAN GROANS] [PAULINE COUGHS] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Whoa, whoa, stop, stop. Ready to talk? Is he dead? Did we kill him? Hey. [COUGHS] MAN 1: Jesus. Are we doing this right? Her location. [COUGHING] - He's had enough, man. - No, he's playing with us. One more bucket full, he's gonna break. Back off. Untie him. [GRUNTING] [COUGHS] LYNN: John. - Look at me. LYNN: John, leave him. Let's get out of here. I can help you get out. JOHN: Go. [MACHINE GUN FIRES] [LYNN GASPS] Come on, you're next. Mr. Anderson, tell them not to go shoot for chrissake. JOHN: Stay behind me, babe. That's right. Back off. You already shot one of your own men. Back off. Lower your weapons, now. Lower. - Hey, no, no, no. - No, no, don't. [LYNN SCREAMING] JOHN: Go. LYNN: Go. [GRUNTING] You look like the one in charge. Got answers for me? You might as well just shoot me, I'm already fucked. Join the club. What is this place? What is it? It's an outpost with one fence. One of many. Why are you wearing the suits? - What are they for? - It's a fall out Bullshit. I know it wasn't a nuke. What is it? Answer me. It's something in the air. A hormone. A weapon we were developing. All right? Big mistake. Big mistake. All of it. [GRUNTS] [GUN COCKS] - You're quite a pair. - Yeah, that's right, we do. The man we came in with, where is he? He's out. He went to get something I need. The woman, the one in the picture? Who is she? What does she have to do with this? She's responsible for everything. It's her fault. LYNN: John, this thing is jammed. Leave it. Come on, let's go. WOMAN [ON PA SYSTEM]: Lock down. Stand by for... Is there really a drill? No, man, the gate's been breached. Hey. Hey. What's going on out there? JOHN: I don't know, babe, but it's not good. - We're good. - Oh, shit, that's great. - Take this one. - Okay. Stay close. ZOE: We never did make it to Nevada. That's the day the bomb went off. What happened to your dad? He, uh... PAULINE: I'm sorry. I ask too many questions sometimes. ZOE: Forgivable. The thing is, how you just saved my life. Didn't you save me? Let's take a walk a little more. [GRUNTS] Hmm. Can you teach me how to throw knives? I don't like feeling helpless. I could. It doesn't mean you won't feel helpless sometimes. You asked about my dad. We were on our way to that gig, when we saw the mushroom cloud, pretty soon our truck stopped. So we camped out on the front of the road for a couple days and then ran out of food. So we started walking along the highway. One morning, I heard this man yelling for help, you know, underneath this, um, bridge. Unh. Aah. It was, uh... It was a trap. It was just like gang... They just want to take whatever they could get. And my dad, on him was his life, so... They took it. I'm sorry. My family had a bunch of close calls but then we all agreed we wouldn't keep on helping other people. It's probably better that way. But we're nice, so we never really stuck to it. Yeah. Wait a second. - Does anything look familiar? - No. I was walking at night, so-- But you set up a hill, that's where you saw the guys with the suits, right? Hey, kiddo, we're gonna find your parents. So lesson one, knife throwing. Okay, so the trick is, balance, right? Right. Not just you, but the knife itself. [JOHN PANTING] So this is the wall. The sun's there. We should be able to read this. Between the Man's map and our map. [LYNN CRYING] What is it? "What is it?" We have nothing. We've lost Grant and Pauline. I almost lost you. We're alive. Our kids are alive. All right, just like you always said, you can feel them, all right? - I can feel them. - I can't feel them. I can't feel them. I can't feel them. [CRYING] You should blame me for losing Grant. Hell, no. What are you talking about? He was with me. It doesn't matter. Of course I don't. I never would. That day was complete mayhem. You know, Grant didn't listen all the time. You know that, babe. You know that. It's not your fault. I shouldn't have pushed Pauline away. Hey, you did the right thing. They could've killed her in there. I would have done the same exact thing as you. All right? Now, listen to me, we're gonna get the family back together. How? How are we gonna do that? You see that wall? I mean, this entire area is enclosed. They can't get very far. We're gonna start at Tent City and we're gonna find them. I'm just amazed how you guys could hang on to this shit for so long. [MAN LAUGHING] I mean, this is incredible self-control. Isn't it interesting? We got a little bit beyond our hunting radius. Look at all these neat shit we find. [MAN WHISTLES] It's a good lesson in leaving your comfort zone, huh? Everybody eat up. We move out in five minutes. I want her in the tent for a little bit. You guys can do whatever you want-- Goddamn it, don't hurt my sister. Just take me instead. No, you're not my type. - All right, let's go. - No. [GROANS] Please stop them. It's up to you how hurt he gets. It can be really tough. [GROANS] See? I'd rather not hurt him. [GRUNTS] It's amazing that troubles that men get in to when there's a power vacuum. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hah. Oh, let them go. Let them go. You're a piss poor substitute for your old man, you know that? You see this? BERSERKERS: Yeah. This is just the beginning. BERSERKERS: Yeah. - Yes. And this is the part where you're thankful to be alive, you dash away. Dash. Dash. This is our time, gentlemen. I just made a deal to get a whole bunch of this hardware for all of you. BERSERKERS: Yeah. - That means, more power for us. BERSERKERS: Yeah. Of course we got to go to Tent City and capture a very important person. Oh, Jesus Christ. What are you running up the fucking hill for? [KAREN SCREAMS] This rarely ever happens. [COCKS] THE MAN: Come on, you. All right, we move out in five minutes. Playtime is over. [BERSERKERS CHUCKLE] You mean like this? Uh, yeah, that's good. That's the grip. But you wouldn't wanna throw this knife. The balance is all wrong. Right. That's good. It's your top heavy, so it won't rotate right. - What would I do next? - Uh, well... We're gonna pick a spot in a tree... You know, or like, uh, knot... [BIRDS CHIRPING] [GUN COCKS] You alone? We're not out looking for trouble, if you're not. We're heading back to our camp. There's people there, families, food. You're welcome to follow if you wish. Grant. Grant. I'm sorry. - Sorry. - It's all right, honey. BEN: We came across them a few miles back. Seems like they're alone. Is that true? I got separated from my family. A lot of us here have. Would you go find Dr. Gerald, tell him that he has a patient? Okay. Had an overturned hospital van on the Paper Mill road. It's pretty well picked over but-- It would be great, but there's a hairline crack, so it won't take the heat. Lidocaine. Yeah, this we can use. Thank you. - This place is pretty amazing. - Yeah, we do our best. You get that knee fixed then we'll show you around. Soldiers and scientists back there, they didn't care who or what we were. I mean, maybe this started as an accident But now it's a huge cover up. Yeah, they probably told people on the outside it wasn't a great explosion. And no survivors. No, and then they're gonna tell the world we were attacked. We should start another war. Who's "they" in your scenario? Our government. With everyone in on the conspiracy, I mean, that is such a huge problem to keep under wraps. [GRUNTS] I mean, how could it knock it out? People don't care. We just want to go to a grocery store, see fully stocked shelves, get more money to buy more crap we don't need. Whole time we're giving free reign to the people in charge. Well I believe people are good... In general. That's why I married you. Well, why are they doing tests on us? That's what they do. Second night in Kandahar, this kid, his father was a sought after Taliban chemist took this... Balloon of purple liquid, threw it inside a tank. Got all over the men inside and, uh... So they quarantined them over a month. All these eggheads poked and prodded them, did all kinds of experiments. Even the ones that got sick, wouldn't even call their families. Brass said it was regrettable but it turned out to be a valuable experiment. Ended up being grape soda. Start of your second tour, you didn't call home for a month. Were you in that tank? - We should keep going. - John, were you in that tank? - Why? - Why? Because I want to know. That was a crucial time for you to not call. We were falling apart. You could've told me that story. Why? Why would I do that? Because I'm your wife. I saw and did a lot of horrible things over there, babe. - You know. - And so what? You want me to come home and download that to you? I could have shared in the burden with you. I want to forget. Do you understand that? - Forget. - You can't forget. Not without squashing a huge chunk of memory. Where a lot of us resides, I bet. [SIGHS] And you can't just will yourself to perform selected brain surgery. It doesn't work that way. When I came back home... All you did was want me to talk about it. You never gave me any space. You're right. Let's go find our kids. My daughter. Abigail. You kind of look alike. Yeah, I thought so too, when I saw you. Did she-- Did she make it? She and my husband were killed about a year before all of this. A drunk driver ran a red light. In a way, I'm thankful. She didn't have to see this world. She was pretty. Yeah. I think so too. Who's Grant? Will you tell me about him? My little brother. My parents and I lost him the day of the explosion. Everyone was trying to get out of the village at once. Uh, there was a traffic jam in the hills. [SIGHS] It was a terrible time. Do you know how to use all these stuff? This is where I do my research. Or try to giving the limitations of the equipment. Trying to discover something? I've tried to reverse something that I already discovered. Because it ended up being bad? Yes. Very. But I'm determined to make this place good. No matter what. Come here. Wow. It was Abigail's. She would want another pretty girl to wear it. And so would I. Knock, knock. Oh. Hello, doctor, how is our patient? See for yourself. She has a cracked rib that go with her twisted knee. I recommend that she stay in bed but she listens just about as well as you do, Karen. The person we're after, why are they so important? Ah, let me worry about that. I ran things while you're gone. I did fine. Yeah, I came upon you while you were running things, remember? You were drunk on it instead of leading with purpose. Hey, if she's so goddamn important, why are we giving her away? Why don't we keep her? That's exactly what we're gonna do, my son. I don't know why. But I wager, whoever has a hold of that bitch is gonna have this brave new world right by the short hairs. And I want those nut sack in my hands. And tomorrow, we will get you into school. Uh, no, thanks. I never really liked school anyway. Uh, well, you don't have a choice here. Really, this is the most important thing that we can do now. Make sure you don't fall behind and that you learn from our mistakes. There's some things we can't lose no matter how bad things get. Mom. Dad. Oh. God, I hoped you'd be here. Oh. Any sign of Grant? Okay. - Are you okay, baby? - Yeah. This is Zoe and Karen. Hi. Welcome. We've heard a lot about you. I say, let them come. I got my men stationed every 50 feet in the woods around us day and night. Look, I don't doubt your organization but we don't call them Berserkers for nothing. They don't care about anything and they fight accordingly, trust me. Call a town meeting, immediately, Ben. I'll announce we're pulling up stakes. We're gonna move to a new location. We agreed that we would stay here long enough to grow some crops. The scouts can come back and harvest whatever comes up. Why? Because of this organized rabbles on their way? Because there are 57 souls here that I feel personally responsible for. If that man is coming that means the military is tracking him. He may not be successful but they will know where this place is. Can I ask why they are after you? It's a hormone that run through all of us called oxytocin. It's released into the blood stream when we're with our families, when we're making love, when we give birth. And in 1953, it was created artificially in a lab at Cornell. The man who synthesized it, won a Nobel prize. Yeah, but my, uh, editor gave me this story. I read up on this. Um, it's nickname is the Love Drug, right? They've done studies where they pump oxytocin into the air of a room of strangers and they-- They attach, they care for one another and they trust one another. Okay. How did this relate to what you've made? I was developing another type of hormone and I stumbled upon oxytocin's polar opposite. A hormone that could make people despise, distrust and even kill. That was not my intent. - What was? - Warrior's scent. The ability to, uh... To make the immune system more aggressive, especially in people with diabetes or cancer or Aids. Look, I'm just a research professor and I had a grant and I did not intend for this to be weaponized. And you believe that's what they're doing at the family labs? Look, if this were attached to a delivery device like a warhead, this hormone that I created could be dropped behind enemy lines then we would never have to send an American troop anywhere. Everyone just goes mad? Well, people become more magnified versions of themselves. Those that lack empathy, or those that are inclined to be controlled will just become even more so. People that are naturally kind, they'll be killed by the others. I find this really hard to believe. You have proof of all this? Look, if you want the press to act as whistle blower here, then you can have to stick your neck out too. In here is a data chip with my research. And a video of the military commandeering my lab. [EXPLODES] What is that? [GASPS] So that explosion was a lab? How? Well, I knew better than anyone how dangerous this hormone was. And out of my hands, I knew scientists could get a face full of it and in a blind rage, they could actually detonate the warhead that they had planned to attach it to. With the lab exploded then your research was probably destroyed. They need your expertise again. And if they get me, my fear is that there is nothing to keep them from firebombing everything within this fence. The world thinks that we're dead, why not just make it so? Karen, how come we're still alive? Because you're together. You're with your family. You feel love. And that is what we are trying to build here. People who rely on each other, who eat together, who work together, who connect. And with these new families that we're building for good stuff, the oxytocin is higher in us than in-- - What do you call them? - The Berserkers? [GUNSHOT] [WOMAN SCREAMS] You stay here, okay, I'll check it out. Hang on to this. BEN: Let's go. Come on. Everyone in the dining tent. Let's go, come on. Let's go, come on. Hurry up. BERSERKER: You're almost surrounded. And have ten minutes to send out your bitch leader. If not, we'll run roughshod over you. Burn your homes, rape your kids and kill your husbands. You think your minute men can save you? Goddamn it. Get in there. Get the guys. Meet in the militia tent. - Ben, what's the plan? - Defense. - All right, I can help. - Me too. Come on, get in there. Girl. - Ready? - Come on, everyone. All right, everyone, get in the middle. You don't wanna be near this table when bullets fly. Lynn. All right, down. It's all right. Get down. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] There they are. All right, where are the others? They're down in their own tents. A few may be leaving. Oh, why would they do that? I can't stand not knowing what's going on out there. Listen, before things get bad, I have to know... - Have you seen this boy? - He's here. Is this Grant? Yes, he's here. He's with Audrey. Audrey. - Jen, where is Audrey? - I don't know. I tried looking for her. I thought she'd be in here. That's all we got, buddy. This is it? Well, yeah, plus what my men are carrying. Army guns are scarce so they shouldn't have much more than that, right? Look, we don't got a scatter gun so you're welcome to this. - I told you I can fight. - Okay. Dylan, Combs, and Bert have all been taken hostage. Norton is dead. They chopped them up with a goddamn cleaver. God. Uh. All right, guys, listen to me. Um-- All right, listen, uh-- Hey, what I suggest, is that we all stock up as much ammo you can carry, fill your pockets. And find some other kind of weapon. One that you can hide somewhere. - You can get to easily. - Yeah, got it. Let's go do what he says, guys. Come on. [GASPS] - How long has it been? - Four minutes, maybe five. Yeah, that's enough. If they fight us, I'm not gonna give them a chance to organize. All right, come on, come on up. Come on up. And anybody touches a hair on that lead lady, I'll kill him myself. I want her. - What the hell is that? - My little hot potato. I'm gonna start things off with a bang. Oh, and what if you kill her? We only have one. It's not gonna kill her. Hey, look at you, you got a good arm? Give it a toss. Jesus Christ. Anytime today. Our families are in the dining tent, so guard them with your life-- [SCREAMS] Oh. Oh. [COUGHING] JOHN: Oh, God. Oh. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] LYNN: John. - I'm fine, get back inside. Karen says Grant's here. In the last tent by the gate. Some woman named Audrey is looking after him. All right, I'll check it out. Get back inside. Shoot anybody who tries to get in. All right, come on. Get up, get on your feet. Listen up. When this thing starts, it's gonna go fast. Our only advantage is to keep a clear head, so keep yours. Move out. Protect that dining tent. - Move out. - All right. Come on. [BERSERKERS SHOUTING] [GRUNTING] [GUN FIRES] [PANTING] [BERSERKER SHOUTS] [GRUNTING] [BERSERKERS SHOUTING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [BERSERKER SCREAMS] [GUNSHOTS] Hello? Hey. Are you Audrey? Have you seen my son? Grant? Dark hair, about this high. Are you Audrey? [CRIES] Just get to the chow tent. It's safe there. [WHISTLES] [MOUTHS] [GUNSHOT] [GASPING] [GRUNTS] They're definitely protecting that one tent. Really? Then get your ass down there and look inside, dumbass. [GRUNTS] Why are you guys still alive? [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Jesus, it's hot today. [BERSERKERS GROWLING] Jesus, they're all over the place. [BERSERKER LAUGHS] [GUN FIRING] - Unh. - Ah. [CHUCKLES] No, no, no. That's Audrey. Come. Come, come, hurry. Audrey, where's the little boy that we agreed that you'd take care of? This is his mother. [CRYING] - Audrey, where is he? - I loved him. I tried my best. KAREN: Audrey, where is he? - He ran away from me. He never spoke. But he left a note saying that he wanted to find his real mother. I'm so sorry. Mom. [GRUNTS] BOY: Mom. - Kid. - Mom. Hey, Zoe, get him back to the mess tent. Quick. [GUNSHOT] [GROANING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [COUGHING] - You throw hatchets too? - Huh, in a pinch. [BEN GASPS] Oh, Ben, how bad is it out there? It's bad enough. MAN: Oh. Put it down. I'll kill her right now. - Ben. - Let's go, Karen. Ben, if you turn me in, they're gonna kill us all eventually. - They're doing that now. - No, come on. Just think about this. You may not be yourself right now, come on. - Ben, this isn't you-- - No! [GUN FIRES] I didn't wanna do that. Who's next? Unh! [GUN FIRING] [COCKS] You again? You're like a bad penny. - That's right. - You give up now. [COCKS] And I'll let you and your whore wife walk out of here. Yeah, I doubt that. Oh? Nobody's worth all this. You take her. You leave us be. Finally, somebody with some common sense. [GUN FIRES] [KAREN SCREAMS] Are you really worth all this? Ha, ha. Because I aim to find out. All right, people, it didn't have to be this way. Remember that when you sit around your camp fires and telling your tall tales about my adventures. You know, maybe I am an idiot. I came for you. That was dumb. You know you've never told me that I did a good job, ever. You did a good job. [GUNSHOT] You treat me worse than you treat anyone. You know that? And I'm your goddamn son. I'm hard on you because I want you to be tough. I want you to survive. Because I love you. Well, that-- Now you're just lying. You think I'm gonna shoot you, and I might. I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. You said whoever has her owns the new world. Come over here. Your mother always said I'd be proud of you someday. And she was right. Look at you, standing up to me. Shut up! Shut up and give her to me now. All right, all right. I will. I will. And you know why? Because this is for the both of us. No, just don't. It always has been. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Oh, my boy. My boy, you go to a better place. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [COUGHS] Anyone follows me, I'll kill her. I got no reason not to. Stay there. Don't follow. [PANTING] Dad, you can't let them take her. Listen. If you hand me over, you may win in the short term, or we're all gonna lose in the end. Shut up. [WHISTLES] Let them know we're serious. I'll kill her. You hear me? [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [GASPS] Let's try this again. This time with you respecting me. That was a warning. You're not getting another one. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GUN CLICKS] [GRUNTING] Keep going, I don't care. [GUNSHOT] [COCKS] [LAUGHS] Who saw this coming, huh? Dad. Go. What are you waiting for? Yeah. [GUN COCKS] I always wanted a girl. [GUN COCKS] Yes. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah. [THE MAN SIGHS] I wasn't lying to you about your boy. [GASPS] I brought him to Tent City, then I forgot about him. But I know where he is now. He's on the outside. They're using him as a pawn. Putting a happy face in all of this. "The boy suffers from post-traumatic stress, or he cannot speak. His doctor says that he's in good health." It's my boy. It's my son, he's alive. Thank God. Where did you get this? "Let's assume that the boy's family is gone like the quarter million others we've lost. Victims to the violent attack against our homeland." John. Oh, such lies. At least, we know where he is. - Yup, and that he's alive. - Yeah. Oh, thank you for the food and clothes. Are you sure you won't just stay? No, we've got to try and find him. But they won't let you out. They'll never let us out. Here's a map. This is where we'll be, so use it. Come and join us when you can because we need people like you. - Thank you. - Thanks for everything. And you too, Zoe, I owe you my life. Hey. Keep practicing, okay? Come here. All right. Bye. Once we find Grant, we'll head to the coast to find a boat? That's right. We'll get your own berth that you need. Or you can share one with your brother. PAULINE: And then we'll just sail away. JOHN: That's the idea. - We'll be safe on the water? - That's the idea too.
