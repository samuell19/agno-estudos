(This program is not related to...) (a particular group, region, religion or individual.) (Han Tae Joo) (Mother) Yes, Mother. What's with your voice? Are you sick? No, I just woke up. Is everything okay with you, Mother? Of course. Well... Tae Joo, about the anniversary of your father's death... Yes. You don't have to come if you're too busy. I know it's a long way here. It's just going to be a small ritual with just your aunt. Don't worry about it. Your father will understand. No, I'll be there. It's been a while since I've seen you. I want to see Aunt as well. I'll be there. Well then, I'll see you soon. Your aunt will be glad to see you too. Okay, I'll call you. Take care. (Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency) Don't do that! - Hey! - What are you doing? - Stay right there! - Who are you? Move! Hey, who was that? - You don't know? - No. - That's the guy. - You mean the whistle-blower? Yes. (Victim: Choi Eun Ju, Age 24) April, 2, 2018, 2:31pm. Evidence No. 342 Analysis Results. There seems to a change... in the benzene derivatives' fluorescence characteristics. Fluorescence wavelength, 278nm. Comparative color, 1.8. It looks to be Propylbenzene that was taken from the sample. It's the same chemical that was found in the victim's underwear. Fluorophotometry was used in analyzing the sample. Using a bright source of light to... Where is he? To analyze fluorescent material of low density. Where is Han Tae Joo? Excuse me. Prosecutor Jeong Seo Hyun? It is you. - It's been a while. - It has. How have you been? I've been great. Let's go. You punk. You think you're all that? Do you? Say something! - Why are you doing this? - Why am I doing this? Look here, punk. I'm facing disciplinary actions because of you. You've done this before, haven't you? Do you think it's right... to stab your fellow policeman in the back? Then what about putting an innocent man behind bars? Is that the right thing to do as a policeman? - What? - Lee Yong Beom, the man you caught, spent three years in prison after being wrongfully charged. Compared to what he went through, the disciplinary actions aren't anything to complain about. What did you just say? Don't make someone a criminal just based on testimonies. Until when will you stick to those old-fashioned methods? You're the guy from the Regional Investigation Unit, aren't you? You are. You still think you're the ace of RIU? Stay quiet and lay low if you betrayed your own family. Who do you think you are, acting like a real detective? Hey, scumbag! Hey! I'm not done yet! You're still the same. You get the same hate whether it be here or at RIU. I guess people don't change that easily. You still ignore people when they talk to you. What do you want? - I have something to say. - Go ahead. Why are you in such a rush? We haven't met in a year. Let's go somewhere nice... to have lunch and talk. You were going to eat alone anyway. I know a place, so let's go there. You're still self-centered. Isn't that why you dated me in the first place? Let's go. That's why we broke up. Don't just stand there. Come in. This is a nice restaurant. Lee Seung Hee, age 22. She worked at a nearby factory while studying for the Civil Service Exam. You've heard of the Manicure Murder Case, right? The one where the murderer would apply manicure on the dead victims? Yes. There are six identified dead victims so far. Seven, including Lee Seung Hee. She was killed in this room last month. The suspect was captured 15 days ago. We're sure it's him. Any hard evidence? None. We didn't find his fingerprints or DNA on the scene. He's someone who bit off his fingertips... to get rid of his own fingerprints. He's quite meticulous. And that's why I need you. Do you know why I liked you? Because I was handsome, smart, and talented? Something kind of like that. I'll acquiesce to the "handsome" part. You were someone who always had to go by the rules. You were arrogant and self-righteous. You were neither friendly nor kind. And you'd always cause trouble wherever you went. But despite all of that... I liked your competence. You were quite sexy to me because you were so competent. Sounds like you're trying to say that's no longer the case. Does it? You might be able to come back to the RIU if you do well. I know you want to do field work after all. Isn't that why you're investigating cases that are getting retrials? Because you miss doing field work? You don't have to do it if you don't feel confident. You'll be pressed for time since the trial is coming up soon anyway. The old you definitely would have been able to handle this, but it'll be too much for the current you. Yes, you're not the same as you used to be. Well, do you want to have something to drink before you go? Next time. Here, take this. I found this while I was cleaning. Honestly speaking, I wanted to throw this out. But I just couldn't bring myself to throw this away. (Haiti Tigers) You feel thankful, right? Yes. I thought that I'd lost this. Is this something valuable? If I'd known, I would have sold it. It's from the baseball game back in 1988. Haiti against Samsung. (Sun Dong Yol) That's when I was given this. It was really hard to come by. You got lucky then. My father got it for me. He barely managed to, by clinging on to their team's bus. How come we never went to go see a baseball game together... when we were dating? After that day, I started hating baseball. Prosecutor Jeong! - I'll be right there. - All right. Do you know that detective? He's the lead investigator for this current case. Yes. I worked with him a while ago. Anyway, thanks for this. I'll be going now. Sure. Wait, hey. Think long and hard about the case. This could end up being your final chance. All right. (The Manicure Serial Murder Case) (Results of Preliminary Forensic Analysis of Evidence) (We were not able to find any matches for the footprints,) (blood, saliva, fingerprints, DNA...) It's me. I read the case file. When should I get started? (Forensics) (National Forensic Service) Tae Joo. Yes? Long time no see. Indeed. - I'll head inside first. - All right. You finally seem a bit sexy now. - I'll see you after this is over. - Sure. Yes, this is Han Tae Joo. Pardon? Yes, please send it to me. I'll take a look. (In Session) (Results of Forensic Analysis) (Courtroom Number 208) Lieutenant Han Tae Joo? Please come in. All right. I am Lieutenant Han Tae Joo of the Evidence Analysis Branch... - at the Forensics Department. - Yes, please go ahead. This is the analysis of the culprit's M.O... on the murder of Lee Seung Hee, the victim. At 7:37pm, on the day of the incident, the victim met the defendant, Kim Min Seok, for the first time... at a convenience store in Sanggyo-dong. I'm sorry. Thank you. I happened to drop some pads at that exact time. But as that jerk picked them up for me, he looked straight into my eyes, and... I had chills running down my spine. Seriously! Wow, that look in his eyes freaked me out so much. He's definitely a scary person. I'm sure of it. Because of him, I ran home as fast as I could! The handkerchief that was discovered inside of the victim's nose... was identified as chloroform, an anesthetic. Cause of death was... respiratory obstruction due to suffocation. The culprit suffocated the victim... by using the underwear that the victim was wearing. Her estimated time of death is around 24:00. (Photos of Victim Lee Seung Hee) The defendant works with incinerators at a cement factory. He had traces of dust from old tires and old plastic... on the clothes that he was wearing at the time. And the same kind of dust was found in the victim's home... and at the convenience store as well. Disregarding the dust for a second, did you find the defendant's blood, DNA, or fingerprints? No, we did not. The dust from old tires and old plastic... could be found just about anywhere, and not just on... the defendant's clothes, don't you think? Do you know that there are factories in the vicinity? There's absolutely no evidence against the defendant... besides the dust. I said that his DNA, blood, and fingerprints weren't found. I never said there wasn't anything else. A person always leaves a faint trail behind where he's been... even when there are no fingerprints. From a person's pores on their fingers, bodily fluids containing... things like fat and protein can be found. The contents of the said bodily fluids depend on the person. Like fingerprints. This is what the murderer left behind. According to the examination of the victim's belongings, the amount of lead, mercury, arsenic, and chrome found was... 12 times higher than the normal amount. The ratio of these properties was similar to that of the victim's... body fluids as she's been exposed to the toxins from nearby factories. (Victim, Lee Seung Hee) Prosecution and the defense, do you have any further questions? No, we don't. No, we don't. Okay, the witness may be excused. Witness, you are excused. Witness. Witness, is there anything else you'd like to say? I suspect contamination of evidence number 2, 4, and 5. From the said evidence, DNA of multiple men, besides the defendant, have been found. Have you been able to identify them? According to the examination, they all belonged to men with criminal records. Currently, they're all deceased. - No way. - I don't believe this. Your Honor, the integrity of the evidence is at risk. I'd like to ask you to re-check to see if this claim is valid. Something is wrong. There's no way the evidence is contaminated that easily. When did you find out? - Just a moment ago. - You could've told me in advance. I didn't have the time. And I'm not allowed to talk about the case before... I know that. But if you have the slightest faith in me, you wouldn't have done this. You're still selfish. You always think you're the only right one. Seo Hyun. Rise. After examining the prosecution content... and pleading, we have come to the following ruling. The evidence submitted by the prosecution is not deemed credible, and therefore cannot be used against the defendant. Since there's a lack of clear evidence, the defendant is not guilty. - What? - No! - No! - What's going on? That's not right. - Seo Hyun. - I don't want to talk to you. Good work, madam prosecutor. Don't be mad. You'll get wrinkles on your face. I think you'd look really pretty if you get dolled up. You have nice hands. I think red manicure would look great on you. Say one more word. I'll send you to jail for sexual harassment. Thank you, Mr. Lieutenant. How will I repay you? There's no need. I'm not doing this for your sake. You're Lieutenant Han Tae Joo, right? Have we met before? You look familiar. Seo Hyun. Seo Hyun. (Personal Details Report) (Seo Hyun) (Voice mail) Lieutenant Han. Lieutenant Han. - Goodness. - What's going on? It's Prosecutor Jeong. The person you have called is unavailable... The memory stick on the black box is gone. And her phone is off, so I can't track it. I've checked the nearby security cameras, and 30 minutes before the accident, Kim Min Seok was on this road as well. Have you checked Kim Min Seok's home address? Yes. I've checked all of his previous addresses, but he wasn't there. (Jeong Seo Hyun, Supreme Prosecutors' Office) You have one message. You were right. Something is wrong. There's someone behind him. Call me when you wake up. Sorry for yelling at you earlier. I'm sorry. Kim Min Seok's vehicle passed the toll gate at 9:31pm. At 12:58am, he passed the Insung toll gate and entered Route 21. He just got here. He shouldn't be far from here. Go this way. Run! You go up, and you go down. The rest, come with me. Hurry! - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. (Sungil-ro) It's Kim Min Seok! Stop right there, Kim Min Seok! Where's Seo Hyun? Why are you asking me that? Where's Seo Hyun? You're hurting me too much that I don't really remember. You better stop playing games. Where's Seo Hyun? Tell me! I remember now. - Where is she? - No, not that. You look just as you did back then, when you were crying because you were so scared. Han Tae Joo. Now I remember who you used to be. What are you talking about? You don't recognize me? Take a good look at me. Remember who I used to be? You don't remember? Come on, try hard to remember. It'd be in your best interest to stop spouting nonsense! Where is Seo Hyun? Where is she, damn it? See you next time, Tae Joo. Who are you? (Han Tae Joo) Tae Joo! Han Tae Joo! Han Tae Joo! Hey, mister. Hey. Hey, are you all right? (Civil Defense) Hey, mister! Hey! Hey, come on now! Why would you just jump in front of a car like that? Young men like you should look both ways before crossing the street! Also, this isn't a crosswalk! You were jaywalking... Hey, wait! What are you doing? What are you doing? (Introducing the brand-new Kia GTE) The interior is fine. It's my bumper that was damaged. Over there. Tuesday, February 23, 1988. 1988? Hey, I asked if you were okay. Shouldn't you go to the hospital or something? What? You have insurance, right? The liability for this is probably a 7 to 3 split, so... It's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, but... it's because I'm worried about me, punk! Hey, it's only been an hour since I got this car! Where are you going? Hey! Geez, the nerve of this guy! Hey, you! You... I hear you! Give me a second! Do you have a death wish? Why, I ought to... You jerk! Why, you... (1988 Olympics in Seoul) What on earth is going on here? Attention, all citizens. This is an emergency war drill zone. As of this moment, we will be conducting the drill. Please head inside! When you hear this alarm, please stop whatever you are doing... and follow the instructions of the civil servants. Please head into the nearest building or shelter. - Hey! - Head inside! Hurry inside! Hurry! Attention, all citizens. This is an emergency war drill zone. - As of this moment... - Hey, mister! You can't be standing there! Get out of the street! When you hear this alarm, please stop whatever you are doing... - and follow the instructions... - Darn it. - He won't listen. - Just a moment. - I'll take care of it, sir. - All right. Hey, mister! - How did this happen? - Hey! I was definitely pursuing Kim Min Seok. Where on earth is this place? - Move your car. - Am I... - dreaming right now? - I said, get out of there! - No, I'm not. - Detective Lee! Hey, why aren't you complying? He didn't answer me when I was calling him either. Give me your ID. Give me your ID! What the... What's with this punk? Hey, get him! Mister! - Hey, stop! - Mister! Hey, mister! Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, mister! - Stop! - Hey! - Hey, mister! Goodness! Stop! Stop! Stop, mister! Stop right there! Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey, you punk! - Hey, this way! - Yes, sir! - After him, quickly! - Yes, sir! My gosh. - Hey! - Catch him! Hurry! After him! Gosh. Why would you run away? He was running... What's wrong with you? You handcuffed him the wrong way. - Are you cops? - Can't you tell? Now, show me your ID. - You have to catch him. - I said, show me your ID. You've got to catch him! Who are you? Who are you, mister? Why are you doing this to me? - Gosh. - Darn it. Gosh, this guy is... driving me crazy. Who are you? What's your deal? - Detective Lee. - What? Could he be... This is insane. Catch him. Okay. Hey! Hey, are you wearing your mom's underwear? (Seobu Police Station) (How to report a North Korean spy) (We'll do our best to protect our citizens.) Can you undo these? I told you. We can't do that until you give us your ID. Please, just stay still. Hey. Let's just get this over with and tell us who you are. Things will get messy once our captain is here. How many times do I have to tell you? First of all, let me loose. Now! How dare you scream at the police? Oh, hello, sir. You have to kick this kind of guys. Now he'll listen. Hold on. I know him. He's the one who bumped into my car and ran off. This little rat. This is great. It's been exactly one month since I said goodbye... to my mother-in-law and left the house to catch you. What kind of guy are you to urinate anywhere? Do you have nothing better to do? Who are you? Are you a cop as well? Wow. Who do you think you're talking to? Let me tell you about myself. I'm the great captain, Kang Dong Cheol, who serves justice. People who can't control their lower abdomen should get theirs cut off. - Come here! - Captain. That's not him. He's right there. Then who is this? Well, we brought him in because he seemed suspicious, but he wouldn't reveal his identity. How dare you toy with us? Who are you? I'm a cop. A cop? - From which district? - Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. I'm Lieutenant Han Tae Joo of the forensic science department. Goodness. You were a cop. You're one of us. Sorry for not noticing. It's okay. Please let me loose. Of course. I will... let you go. Yes. Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's forensic science department? What kind of ridiculous lie is that? Hey, we get the truth out by beating people up, not by science. And hey, if you want to lie, do it properly. What kind of police agency is "Metropolitan"? It's not Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. It's Seoul City Police Agency. And what was it? "Forensic science"? Hey, where did that come from? Is that a name of some kids' TV show? He's been saying that kind of nonsense from the beginning. I think he's a lunatic. Should we bring him to a psychiatrist? He looks like a decent guy though. Seriously, who are you? I said I'm a cop! It's been a while since a guy made me this angry. Hey, guys like you should be beat up. You... That's enough. If you do this again, I won't stay still. You won't stay still? Then... don't. Hey, open his handcuff. - Pardon? - Hurry! - Okay. - You should not stay still. Okay, let's see who wins. In 1966, I won the silver medal in the Asian Games in Bangkok. You're dead meat. 1, 2. - Hurry! - Okay. You punk. - Gosh, you little... - Go! - You punk. - Yes! You little punk. Why, you... Hey, you! Hey! Stop! That's enough. This punk's got some fire. You take your chance and come at me? - Stop! - Captain! - You little... - Captain! - Look! - What is it? Look at this. What is this? It's from this guy's jacket. I think... This punk... Isn't this fake? I don't think so. It even has the director's signature stamp. (Director, Lee Kyung Cheol) Is he really a cop? Is this yours? They should've told us someone was coming. Does he take us for fools? If he's a chief inspector, then what about Detective Lee? Shut it. Is the dinner party still on? Shut your mouth. I mean... If they told us about your transfer in advance, you know... Right? Because you were just yelling at us, you made us misunderstand. Wipe your face. So you're saying that I've been transferred here? In 1988? We all had no idea, so let's just forget all this. I've already introduced myself. This is Lee Yong Gi. - He's a brave dude. - Do you have good connections? Hey, don't be like that. This is our youngest, Nam Sik. There's nothing he's good at. I'm Cho Nam Sik. Sorry for what happened earlier. Hey, where's Ms. Yoon? She's out for a delivery. I see. You'll meet her later. And... What are you looking at? I saw nothing. "Nothing"? Why, this little... Goodness. You saw nothing? Are you joking with me? Come here. - I'm fine here. - I said, come here! Hey, bring me the keys. I'm going to open this! There are only 207 days left until the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Even though it's held in South Korea, many communist countries... including the Soviet Union will be participating in the event. 161 countries around the world... - 1988 Seoul Olympics? - About 15,000 athletes... will be participating. This international sporting events will hold... more than 220 sub-events. About 100,000 of foreigners will visit Korea. Many aspects of the society and international politics... will benefit from this event and even after the Olympics, it will... (Captain Kang Dong Cheol) Is this a dream? Or have I gone crazy? If it's neither, why am I here right now? I'm back. - Oh, Ms. Yoon. - Yes? Get me coffee. Hey, get me one too! - All right. - And one for me too, please. Oh, say hello, Ms. Yoon. He's the new chief inspector from Seoul. Hello. Shall I get you a cup of coffee as well, sir? No, it's fine. - Ms. Yoon. - Yes? Wash this for me after you get me my coffee. I haven't washed it in a month and it's practically rotting. - Here, take it. - Yes, sir. My gosh. Therefore, the new... The festivities for the Olympics are... Sir? Are you all right? Are you all right? Yes. Blood pressure is dropping, Doctor! He's losing a lot of blood! Give him an IV. And call Doctor Jang. Yes, Doctor. We mustn't let him lose consciousness. Can you hear me, Mr. Han Tae Joo? Mr. Han Tae Joo. Who are you? Mr. Han Tae Joo? Mr. Han Tae Joo. Mr. Han Tae Joo? Mr. Han Tae Joo? Mr. Han Tae Joo. - Can you hear me? - I can hear you! Mr. Han Tae Joo? I said, I can hear you! Chief! Are you all right? - What year is it now? - Pardon? Is it really 1988? Yes, it really is 1988. You look terrible, sir. Are you really all right? (Insung Shopping Complex) (Insung Shopping Complex) I'd like to use your phone. The number you dialed is not in service. The number you dialed is not in service. Yes, can I help you? Connect me to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, please. Sorry, but I don't have anything under that name. Shall I connect you to Seoul City Police Agency instead? You have no idea what's going on, right? If you keep thinking about why you've come here, it'll just make your head hurt. It feels as if you just fell out of the sky, doesn't it? I'm well-acquainted with that feeling. Everyone feels that way on their first time here. Everyone acted just like you, Detective. How did you know that I'm a detective? People like us can tell just by looking at you. The detectives here are giving you a hard time, right? That's the kind of place Insung is. It's a real piece of work. It was really hard for me to get this place up and running, you know. It seems like you traveled far. But you only need to watch out for one person here. There's a guy in Unit Three who has the nastiest temper. His name is Captain Kang Dong Cheol. All you have to do is avoid that crazy hog, okay? Why are you blabbing instead of welcoming customers, you punk? - Captain, you're here. - Hey. 50. 50km per hour, you punk. My ear itches. Who's talking about me behind my back? Was it you? It wasn't me, sir. Goodness, you're quite a character, seeing as how you're day-drinking on your first day on the job. But hey, Mr. Detective from Seoul. What reason would you have for coming to a dump like this? And you were sent here without even any prior notice. Hey, you're going to keep ignoring me? Why aren't you answering my questions, you punk? I'm more curious than you are to know why I've come here. What? What are you even saying? Anyway, I think your head is jumbled... because of the car accident you were in before. But stop spouting nonsense and just go home. Home? Where's that? You can think of this as company housing. The bathroom is over here. And I did clean this place yesterday, but... Get some rest, sir. Thank you. By the way, how should I address you? Well... Yoon? Ms. Yoon? Madam Yoon? Or just, "Hey"? Just call me whatever you'd like. Do you not have a name? It's Yoon Na Yeong. Thank you, Officer Yoon Na Yeong. All right, then. Excuse me. Have you considered going to the hospital? Pardon? You seem to be suffering from car accident symptoms. There's a hospital that is affiliated with our police station. So if you just tell them your name, the doctor in charge over there will take care of everything. It'd be nice if they could fix my current problem as well. At any rate, thank you. Officer Yoon Na Yeong. He was able to accomplish a miracle during the Asian Games... and emerged victorious as the winner. I'm sure that he will make the citizens proud... during the 1988 Olympics as well. (Chief Inspector) Detective Han Tae Joo is the problem. What kind of predicament is this? Will he be able to wake up? Look, Detective Han Tae Joo. Do you hear me? They say that critical damage has been done to the brain, but the soul doesn't stay within the body forever. You can't give up! Don't lose unconsciousness! Do you hear me, Detective Han Tae Joo? Yes, I hear you. I'm listening. This is bad. Where are you going? Don't go! Don't... Don't go. Don't go! (Screen Adjustment) This isn't real. It's all a dream. Tae Joo, what are you doing? Tae Joo? What's with you? Did you doze off while I was gone? This isn't a dream, right? What are you talking about? You're testifying today. Right, I know. What's the matter? I think something's in my suit. Why is this in here? What's this? Hey, Han Tae Joo! Hey! I know you're in there! Hey! This punk. What the... The door's open. What are you doing in here? What are you doing, sleeping until this late hour? You were absent today without prior notice. Hurry up and come out! We've been dispatched. What are you waiting for? Come on out, you punk! Hello, sir. Did you identify the victim? Yes, do you remember the coffee shop girl who was reported missing? - Ms. Yang? - Yes, sir. My gosh. Hey, is that reporter here? He got here first and is sticking his nose where it doesn't belong. That punk's never late to a crime scene. Hey, get out of the car. This guy is driving me crazy. Where are we going? Isn't it obvious? We're detectives. Excuse me. Coming through. Please make way. What happened? Nothing happened. It's nothing serious. Step back. My goodness. (Life on Mars) Could it be Kim Min Seok? Is he here as well? If this case is related to Kim Min Seok, there surely will be a connection somewhere. Their daughter was out of reach and didn't come home for a while. This isn't a simple murder case. It's serial murder. The shoe sole has a unique pattern. Are you an FBI or what? We're looking for someone. That person wears weird-looking shoes. You seem to know a lot about this case. What do you know? There was a similar case like this in Seoul. You think it's the same guy? We'll find out once we catch him. As well as the reason for my being here. Could it be Kim Min Seok? Is he here as well?
