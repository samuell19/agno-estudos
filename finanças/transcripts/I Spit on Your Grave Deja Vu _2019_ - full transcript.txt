Subtitles by explosiveskull Bet you're gonna like it here. I intend to. And you're gonna write a book here? My first novel. What are you guys doing?! Relax, damn it! Suck it! You're gonna die if you don't suck it! Leroy from Montgomery, Alabama, what say you? Miss Hills. Hi, Leroy. You can call me Jennifer. Hi, Jennifer. You describe in your book how just two weeks after the horrible assault on you, you seduced the mentally retarded Matthew to have intercourse with you in the woods. Then you lured Johnny, the leader of the gang, to have sex with you in the bathtub. Those low-lives beat the hell out of you, they savagely raped and sodomized you and then left you for dead. How could you chose to give them, how shall I put it, the ultimate pleasure of life before you killed them? I wanted them to be as vulnerable as I was when they assaulted me. Naked, defenseless and helpless. And then, to strike them at their supreme moment. Supreme moment? Oh, you mean... Yes. At the peak of their orgasm. And boy, oh boy, did you make them pay. Reverend James Motley, you're on America's number one radio talk show. Go ahead, Reverend. Miss Hills, me and my parishioners question why, after all the horrible things they did to you, you let your body come again in touch with those sinners. You mean, Reverend, why was I willing to desecrate it? Voluntarily, that is. Precisely. As you can imagine, Reverend, I did not have the physical strength of my rapist. We are here with Jennifer Hills, discussing her controversial book... Hello? Hey, Herman, are you listening? Do you hear me, Herman? Are you listening?! Listening. Good! The only advantage at my disposal was by God's given weapon, my sexual appeal. So I used it to entice and trick them. To their demise? Precisely. In other words, you were willing to violate and to dehumanize yourself, this time voluntarily, all in the name of vengeance? Justice, Reverend. Justice. Wouldn't you rather see me in the flesh? That was mean, kid-o. Hi, Mom. I thought I was gonna die of starvation before you showed up. Sorry. I was besieged with fans after the show. Summer swimsuits, autographs, couldn't let them down. Okay, girl, I forgive you. So what are we having? Who's paying today? You are. That's okay, I got it for being late. In this case, I'm gonna have, let's see, the two inch filet mignon, a lobster, a bowl of caviar and, oh yes, a bottle of champaign. Buongiorno, Madame Hills. Buongiorno, Marcello Buongiorno, Senorita Christina. What will we be having today? A bowl of mixed garden salad, lots of garlic. And for you, Christina? Just a glass of sparkling water, please. She's on a perpetual diet. You gotta eat, soon enough you will vanish into thin air. Lots of garlic? Ew. Why, you know somebody out their that's waiting anxiously to kiss me? No, Mom, actually I don't. You never have time for that. Let's face it, you run around like a chicken without a head. Doing lectures, interviews, counseling rape victims. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's all really cool, but I kind wish you'd just give it all up. You know, find yourself a nice balding guy who doesn't mind kissing you with that awful stench of garlic on your breath. Settle down already, Mom. I've done pretty good with you, babe, as a single mom, and I'm managing very well, thank you, without a man, balding or hairy, telling me what to do with my life and how to run my career. Thank you, Marcello. Bon app√©tit. Well. Well, what? What is it that you wanted to talk about? Mom, it can't go on forever. What can't? My career. I've been doing it since I was 10. Getting a little tired of it. Eat. You've been blessed, Christy. You are the most famous and highest paid model in the whole world. Millions of girls out there would do anything just to be, for one day, in your shoes. So what is there to be tired of? Tired of the constant pressure. Tired of flying. I'm tired of airplane food. Tired of sleeping everyday in a different bed in a different hotel. I'm tired of posing in front of the cameras and cat walking every day on a different ramp and not even knowing what city, or even country, I'm in. I'm tired of wondering what the people are really poking their eyes at. Is it the piece that I'm wearing or it is my ass and my tits? Let's face it, Mom, I'm nothing but a fucking walking mannequin being used to sell a product. Who gives a damn, Christy? You got the look that sells magazines, the body that sells clothes. That's why you're being paid in gold. What else do you wish for? You must be very grateful for everything you have, Christy. You never know in life. It can all suddenly change before there's time to appreciate it. Mom, come on, you know that I appreciate it. It's just, it just doesn't mean much to me anymore. You know, I wanna do something that challenges me, uses my brains. And, unlike you, I'd like to find a nice guy who loves me and I love too, settle down, have kids, get married. Four or five kids. Make you a grandma. Thanks, Christy. You warm my heart. You made me cry. Oh. You were only five when you said to me, "Mommy, when I grow up, can I be a model?" And I said, "Christy, you can be anything you wanna be." And I say that now. Besides, modeling has a very short shelf life. Thanks, Mom. Well now, I guess I can tell you something that I couldn't before. Oh? I was offered half a million to shave my head and pose for the cover of a men's fashion magazine. And... Another half a million if I do it topless. Please don't tell me what I think you said. I did. You devil, you. You turned it down. I'll be damned. Go tell them, for a million bucks, I'll do it head shaven and in the nude. Total nude. You're so crazy, Mom. Christy? Miss Hills? Could we get your autographs? Sure. We're really big fans. I just bought your book today. Sure, I'd be glad to. Well that was nice, we got to meet in the middle of the day. Yep. There they are, Scotty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can take a cab home. Come on. I'll give you a ride home. If you tip me well. Oh, gosh. Always full of jokes, aren't you? Oh yeah, I try. Where'd you park? Excuse me, ma'am, excuse me. Aren't you Jennifer Hills? The one and only. I'll be damned. See, Scotty, I told you it was her. Here, here, hand it to me quick! Look what we just got. Oh. A copy of your new book. You think we could get your autograph? - Say please. - Sure. Please! Pretty please. Gladly. Thank you so much. I can't believe this. Standing right next to the famous Jennifer Hills. To who should I make it out to? I'm Kevin, that there's Scott. We drove three straight hours, ma'am. It's an honor to meet you. Aw. Okay. Hey! Hey! Hey, what're you doing?! - You want our money? - Bitch! Hey, stop it! - Fuck you! - Stop it! Help! Help! Christy! Help! Christy! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Christy! Son of a bitches! Christy! Christy! You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Put a fucking lid on her, Scotty! Come on! You're coming with us. Shut your fucking face! What is she doing here? She was with her. They came together out of the rest... I just wanna know why the fuck you had to drag her along?! We couldn't help it, Becky, she was there. She's an eye witness. Her name is Christina Hills, you assholes. She's that woman's daughter. Her hands are clean. Let's move it! Let's do it. Pleased to meet you. I've seen you in loads of ads and TV commercials since you were much younger. You used to smile then. And I've been watching you lately on the runway too. You looking like a fucking anorexic, sad walking mannequin. What did you expect, Becky? All models starve themselves. They wanna look like toothpicks. Yeah, don't you know? Starving is a way of life it'll fucking drive all those smiles away. Why aren't you fucking smiling no more? Getting tired of it all? I like your eyes. You ain't got 'em from your momma, that's for damn sure. Welcome back, Jennifer Hills. You ain't as fucking beautiful as you think you are. You ain't! You are getting mighty famous and filthy rich on account of my husband's blood. And the innocent blood of my dear brother, Stanley! And my cousin, Andy. He was like a big brother to me and she, she slaughtered him. Johnny loved me and the kids. He was a good man. A church going man. Andy and Stanley didn't go to church but they was good men too. Matthew did. Mhmm, he went to church. Yeah but Matthew was a retard. He don't fucking count. Retards do count. Johnny was always faithful to me Until you, like a bitch in heat, came along and seduced him. Oh Jesus. Oh God Oh God! It felt good to butcher him, didn't it? I can imagine what a thrilling fucking moment that was for you. But the kick you got from cutting off his dick was just the foreplay. You got hotter and hotter as he was crying and screaming and going into convulsions. Bleeding to death. Oh God! Oh shit! Oh shit! It aroused you more and more and more until you felt in fucking seventh heaven. That's why you killed him, isn't it? Watching him die made you cum. Life is a bamboozling journey. And we don't fucking know when in how we'll die. We can just wish it won't be fucking painful as the horrible deaths you inflicted on your victims. You made goddamn sure that each of them died painfully. But the way you let my husband die, their ain't no fucking way more painful than that! Like our Jesus! Jesus on the cross! My husband didn't go willingly to his death and he wasn't fucking resurrected! I waited a whole week to bury him. I didn't want him to go into his grave without his goddamn dick! Tell me, what did you do with it? I bet she ate it. I bet she's a cannibal too. But I say? I say she dumped it in the river and the fishes ate it. You ain't nothing but a murderer. A glorified, sexually deranged mass murderer. Stop it! Stop! My mother is not a murderer. All right? And the jury released her of all charges. Declared her innocent. Innocent! Innocent, my ass! It was a New York City jury. They spit on us small town hicks. How much more misery does my mom have to endure from you people? Endure? What the fuck is endure? Does this dumb bitch speak in American?! I bet where she comes from, the big city, it means "eat shit." What about all the misery and shit that your momma laid on me? Or maybe I ain't count. I was every inch the lady and look at me now. Your momma made a hole in my heart. For plenty nights I lay lonely and awake in my cold bed, just gazing at the empty space next to me. Remembering Johnny's body heat. And I'm crying. Crying for me and for our two children. And all they'll miss. All they'll miss growing up without a daddy, just when the need him the most. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! Yahoo! Daddy, tell him to give me back my dollar. He stole my dollar! I didn't, she's lying. And every day, every day, I pray to God to give me the day, to give me the day when you fall into my hands. So I can give you a preview to hell until you beg me to kill you. This day is here now! Hallelujah! Amen! Amen! Amen. Cut the bitch's feet loose. Time to start cutting, you fucking bitches! I don't care what you do to me but leave my daughter alone! Leave her alone. Oh boy, oh boy. Watch out, guys. The bitch is snarling. Don't mess with her! Jesus. Only a woman could scream that loud. Only a woman gets to scream that loud, Scotty! Please just let my mom go, all right? She'll give you money, if that's what you want. You can have whatever you want. Screw her money, missy. Don't you dare hurt my mom! Don't you dare! What do you say, guys? Shall we? You guys are gonna face kidnapping charges. You guys are going to jail for life, I'm telling you. No! No! No! No! You and your fucking people ain't got the power to charge us with nothing. Only the Almighty can judge us folks and He's on our side! It's in the bible. Read it! God's word! Take her back to New York City. Let her bring over the police, the FBI, the whole fucking United States Army. We ain't scared of them none. Stop your fucking moving and wiggling bullshit! Let's go, bitch! Come on! Christy! Christy! Christy! Move, bitch! - No! - You sit down! Now you raise up! You can look at what the fuck you have done! This shit is for you! Matthew. Matthew! You dig what he's saying? He says this is his son. Matthew. He may have been a bit slow, but he- He says, "His son may have been a bit slow in the head but he was decent boy." Decent boy! All them boys! Why? Why? Why?! You're wasting your breath, Herman. It's useless to ask why, why, why. Useless! I know why! Because you are a sexually deranged blood lusting mass murdering freak! That's why. Now bitch! Turn your fucking ass! Now you fucking dig, bitch! Dig deep, bitch! Deep! Start digging, bitch! - Start digging! - Okay! Okay! You vented your rage. You've made your point! Now bring me my daughter and let us go home! We both promise never to say anything about this incident. I promise. I promise. Vented our rage? Justice is what we're raging for. We're freaking for justice! And the only just for a killer bitch, like you, is a knife through your throat! A stab through the evil fucking heart and six feet of crushing dirt! Bring my daughter back to me and let us go home. I picked this piece for you because I want you to say good-goddamn-bye to life and go into your internal fucking life in hell like you made my husband go. Slowly, bit by bit, to the sound of music. Now let me chop this bitch open wide! Let me chop this bitch wide! Fucking painfully! You cunt bitch! Cool it, Kevin! Die! Now dig or I'm gonna let him! Dig, bitch, dig! Let me slice this bitch open, Becky! Let me fucking opening her up and let her bleed, Becky! Come on! Let me fucking get in there, Becky! Go, Kevin, rip her fucking face off! Make her ugly! Time to fix that makeup, bitch! Yah! You bitch! Bitch! Goddamn you! Kevin! Kevin! Now tell me, where's my daughter? Were is that scumbag headed with my daughter? Tell me! Fuck you! You! Stand up there and put that noose around your neck. You can't say that to me, fuck face! My gun says I can. Fuck! Jesus Christ, I don't know where you daughter is. I swear to fucking Christ I don't. I swear! Becky, tell her where the fuck she's at. Tell her. Fucking tell her, Becky! I ain't telling her shit! Go ahead, shoot us! You, hippo, kick the stump. Do it! Herman. It'll take a dozen bullets to knock him real dead and you fucking ain't got 'em! Go ahead, pull the trigger on 'em! Try it! You bunch of moron hicks. I'll be back for you. You ain't gonna go far, Jennifer Hills. We're gonna catch up with you. Soon! And we ain't no bunch of moron hicks, you old cunt! You think we ain't no humans just cause we ain't no big city folks like you! We fear God and we pay our taxes too. We are might proud of who we are! Mighty proud! Hey, guys, wait for me. Wait for me! We wasted too much... We didn't wait too much time with her, Herman. I coulda killed her right then and there. I wanted her to run fucking scared. But why, Becky, why?! Ain't we going in for the fast kill? No. We're playing fucking Tom and Jerry games with her. Like she did with my husband, Johnny. You go fox hunting, don't you, Kevin? Then you fucking know that it ain't the slay that matters. The thrill of a good kill is gaged by how exciting the hunt is. Yeah! Come on, Herm. Sit still and shut up. Mmm, Mmm what? Shut up or I'll smack you on the kisser. Jeez! You're gonna kill me, aren't you? Oh shit. How? How are you gonna do it? Where? What are they gonna do to my mother? Tell me! My mother is indestructible. She's gonna get away. You'll see. And she'll be after you and your friends too. You know what my mother's capable of doing when she gets mad. Hey. Hey, can you pull over, I gotta go. Go where? Take a hard guess, dummy. Holy shit. I'll scream. Go ahead. Scream. Fine. I'll go right here. Nobody fucking pees in my van. Don't try anything funny or I'll break your goddamn neck. Over there. In the bushes. Hey. I ain't stupid. Mmmm. You wanna have some fun before we go back to New York City? Okay. Where are you? Come on out. You think I've never seen a naked woman before? I fucked a retard once. I get it. You wanna see me naked too. Okay. Goddamn it! Come back! I'm gonna get you for this, you fucking bitch! Hey! Hey, come back here! Hey! Hey, come back here! Hey! You and your mother are both goddamn sluts! Goddamn it. Becky's gonna chop my balls off! I'll get you my pretty and your little girl too! Please don't shoot! We ain't got no money! But you can take our old Lucy, here. Old Lucy. You got a phone? I need to call the police. No, we ain't got no use for no phone no more, dear, because we ain't got nobody left no more for us to call. And we ain't got nobody left to call us either. Something gone wrong, dear? My daughter and I were kidnapped by these weird, crazy people! I escaped! She didn't. She still being held hostage? I told you, Henry, we shoulda stayed home today. It's the loony's day out. Look, the moon, it's full. Like a big, white wedding balloon. Please, my daughter is in danger. Get in. Here. Take a swig, hon, it'll calm your nerves. Oh, forget it. Here's a man for you. First, his sex drive conks out, then his hearing quit and finally, when his memory kisses his ass goodbye, what do I end up with? A fucking vegetable. Right, Henry? What did you say, Millie? Vegetable, Henry! That's what you are. I Like them vegetables. But no carrots. Can't chew on them carrots. I'm getting on in years too. I ain't fucked up like that. Can't chew on them carrots. Whoa! Wait a minute, stop her, Henry. I reckon I'm getting fucked up in here too. This peaceful town ain't got no police. You wait here, dear. We're gonna get you the sheriff in the next town. We're on our way there anyway to buy a load of shit. Horse shit, you know? For the plants in our farm. Thanks but please hurry up. Help will be coming your way, dear. Very soon.

You gotta hold her for me! Now come on! God forgive me! What the fuck for?! She is getting what she deserves. This is payback time! For Christ sake, would you fucking hold her for me now?! Do you see? Do you fucking see?! She's fucking walking away! Do you see?! Fuck you, Herman! - Come here! - No, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Come on. Come back, you come back.

A crooked heart shall depart from me. Evil I will not know. Oh fuck. Fuck yeah! Yeah, yeah. Evil I will not know! You got no fucking idea what you missed out on, Herman. God put her sweet ass on this planet for us to enjoy! Just like he put those sweet corns in your garden, Herman. Oh, fuck. Hey, sweet juice. Want some more? Where to, hon? There are wild animals in this forest and the night is getting near. It ain't safe in the dark. She got his eyes, don't she? Same nose and same freaking chin. I see the eyes. Mainly the eyes. Just let me go. Hey, Herman! Come here, big boy. See if you can see a little bit of Matthew in this face. A bit of Matthew? Give me a break. What's the matter, dear? I ain't attractive enough for ya? Or is it because I ain't belong to the right kind of people? My fingernails are dirty with grease and my skin smells of gasoline. I'm a working woman! I can't afford Christina's Choice. Is that a crime? So don't play hard to get with me. Miss world class supermodel, I read the gossip columns and you ain't exactly "Miss Holy Virgin." You've been banged away by zillions of celebrities and billionaires males and females. All the way from New York City to Timbuk-fucking-tu! All I wanna do is give you the taste of real affection. Try that again, I'm gonna make ya beg me to kill ya! Well, well, well, lookie who's here. Oh, I can't wait to hear how she out-foxed ya, Scotty. What did she do? Let you get a peek at her boobs?

I'm gonna transport you to paradise like no man you've ever made it with. Stop! Stop! Stop it! Stop! Please, stop! Blasphemy! What the fuck is he doing?! What the fuck?! Bring her back, Herman! Now! Why'd you let her go? Why? Did you fucking ask him why he had to hit so goddamn hard?! You don't Fucking slug your friend, you dumb fuck! Whose fucking side are you, Herman?! Whose? Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Oink, oink, oink, oink! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Oink, oink, oink, oink! I ain't no pig! Whoa. And you can't talk to me like no cock-a-doodle chicken! I'm a human being! I got f-f-f-f-feelings! Hear that, boys? The man can talk. Congratulations, Herman. Maybe we gotta bash you on the head like that more often! Fucking cry baby, cry baby, cry baby! Cool it, Kevin. Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby! Cry baby! Cool it, Kevin! Man's in shock. Can suddenly fucking talk? Come here, Herman. Come on. My big little baby. Blasphemy! Blasphemy! Don't you give me them big shit holy bible words! I ain't seen you in church lately, have I?! Sometimes you act just like a real jackass! Like you're missing a few screws up here! I can't believe he fucking let her go! What are we gonna do?! Shut up, Kevin! You're goddamn doing too much worrying for a guy your age! This ain't New York City. She'll be running up blind alleys around here, even in broad daylight. Besides, as I said, the hunt is more exciting than the kill, ain't it? Yes! Hey! First thing tomorrow, you are gonna go hunting for her for me! You're gonna bring her back to me, dead or alive, I do not give a shit! Or you ain't gonna show your fat ass around us no more! Got me?! And for God sake, zip up your fly! You blew it for me and Becky! You blew it! We coulda had a good time! A good time! Yeah, Herman! Why'd you have to hit so damn hard?! We ain't no match for you! You big dumbfuck, Godzilla! Okay, okay, guys, keep it down! We got fucking things to do! Nighty-night and sweet dreams to you, little missy, wherever you are! Here she is, Johnny. Sealed and delivered, like I promised. But now that it's all over, there is something I gotta tell you. It may wound you but if I hold it in any longer, I'll blow out my teeth. I reckon it was Satan who sent her to seduce you and I know how mighty hard it is to stand up to its temptations but, still and all, the good book says "thou shall not commit adultery." You hurt me, Johnny. You hurt me real good. Didn't I always perform my wifely duties to you? Didn't I? And I still do, Johnny. I still do. Since you was gone, I've worked my ass off at the station to make some decent dough so that Johnny Jr. and Melissa can eat well and dress well and get through college. Because you told me when they was little, you said you wished they wouldn't have to pump gas for a living. Here. Look at em'. You oughta be proud, Johnny. Mighty proud. They've grown up to become decent and respectable folks. They live in the big city now. New York. Far from me. But I reckon they like it there. They're gonna be riding out here tomorrow to celebrate Easter with their ma. But our joy won't be complete, Johnny. It won't. Because you won't be here to celebrate with us. Hey, guys. So good to see you boys. You gotta be mighty pleased with us. We finally got that evil bitch! We evened the score for you. For all of you! And we're gonna get even with Satan too. Goddamn right! We're gonna destroy her child! Goddamn right! The fruit of his evil temptations! Goddamn right! Do it! Put it in. Why me? Because. You forgive me, don't you? Most beautiful day, ain't it now, Becky? Ha, beautiful, my ass. Why the hell ain't you out there looking for her? We was already looking but Scotty, here, felt like stopping by your place first. And guess what he's got for you now. Johnny used to bring me fresh flowers every Sunday morning before church. We know. You're forgiven. Look at you, you're blushing like a little school girl. You little sweet little cupcake. Has the ink got into your brain, punk? Be nice to him. Shit. Go, Kevin. Carnation. And? Pom pom daisy. Button daisy. Mini carnation. Statice, that's the forever flower. And that's our lemon leaf. Pretty fucking good for a public school dropout. Have you seen Herman? No. Oh yes, I must've hurt his feelings. And he doesn't goddamn answer his phone, the dumb fuck. It's because he probably can't hear the rings, Becky. Or maybe he ain't home because he's already out looking for her. Man's getting senile, we can't count on him no more. The man was born senile. Watch your mouth, Scotty. Herman put up that farm and made it what it is with his bare hands. What have you done lately with your life? Early this morning, somebody snatched clothes out of Wilma's backyard. It wasn't me. Me neither. Who is blaming you, dummies?! Maybe it was her! It could be one of them drifters passing through. Oh it could, my ass. Next thing you know, she'll be sneaking out of here right under our noses and then what? Get her for me, dead or alive. Start with the woods along the creek. Well get moving, I got a business to run here! Fucking big place, New York City is. I caught sight of it for the first time in my life. It's fucking huge. Yeah. One day I'm gonna ditch this crummy, fucking hick town and go to New York because that's where all the action is, man. The real action. What're you gonna do, huh? You don't know nobody there. That shit don't matter, see? Because nobody fucking knows each other there. Not even the folks that was born there. But that's what I like about it. You still got a chance to be somebody. Yeah. One day, I'm gonna go to New York and I'm gonna be somebody and everybody's gonna wanna get to know me. And I'm gonna get to know everybody. Everybody that counts, that is. You mean, like, folks with lots of money? Beautiful women? Fucking-A right, Scotty! All those toothpick skinny model bitches too. I'm gonna fuck 'em all. Put back a smile on those sad, little faces. Hey, Kevin, can I go there with you? Sure, Scotty, sure, yeah, yeah. If you wanna be somebody. Yeah. On second thought, you ain't got no business being there. Unless you plan on scrubbing out toilets in those big, beautiful skyscrapers for the rest of your pitiful life. Why'd you say that? Because you got no fucking idea about what you wanna do or who you wanna be. Yeah, you best just stay here in this shit dump town. It's a perfect fucking place for you. Cause you got that typical hillbilly, fucking redneck mentality. See, you were born here and you're gonna fucking die here. And when you do die here, you know who's gonna care? Nobody! Nobody's gonna even give a shit - that you existed! - You don't mean that, Kevin! You're only kidding, right? We're gonna go together because, well, because we're best friends, ain't we? We're friends. Best friends. Yeah. Hmmmm. I know what we could do there. We could open up a flower shop. Yeah. You'll manage the shop and I'll deliver the flowers. I could throw in my van. Cost me three grand, you know? I do love the van. I do love your van. Let me think about it. I will think about it. Okay. All right. Holy fuck, man! Herman's car! Hey! Herman! Over here! I bet the dumb fuck is trying to give us some kind of signal or something. Yeah. Let me go see what this butt-fuck buffoon's up to, alright. Still fucking hurts, you know? I ain't talking to him until he begs me to forgive him. Fucking-A, right! My ball's turned blue. I swear to Christ he fucking cracked them. Good, then we can make an omelet! I like mine sunny side up. It ain't funny! It ain't funny! All right. Where's you big ass at, boy? Hey, Herman! Come on out! We ain't mad at you now more, big boy! Come on! Don't be scared! All is forgiven, Herman! Fucking idiot. Herman! Quit fucking playing games! Bring your ass out here, boy! Herman! Herman is dead. Hey, Scotty! Guess what! Yo, Kevin, is he there? No, man, he ain't! But guess who the fuck is. Who? Come on, Kevin, who? Tell him. Well, come on, man! Tell him. It's her! She's here! Yeah, what's she doing? She's pointing a gun at my face! Come on, Kevin, you ain't foolin' me! Now put it down. Slowly. Get down. Now strip. What'd you say? Could you say that a little bit louder? Come on. I can't. But my gun can. Much louder. Okay, okay. You ain't gonna kill me, right? Your boots. Please. Please, don't kill me. Please don't fucking shoot me. It was Scotty, that sick fucking jerk over there. Ever since he laid his eyes on you, all he could think about was getting into your pants. It was his fucking idea to rape you in the beginning! The shorts. Please don't kill me. You're not gonna shoot me, right? You're not the type. You're not cruel. You won't carry out a cold-blooded murder. Not like your mother. Right? You don't have that cruelness in your heart. Please, please. I'm so fucking sorry for what we did to your mother and for what I've done to you. I never wanted to get mixed up in this goddamn thing from the beginning. But I was fucking forced to by Becky! As soon as she lost her husband, she went completely fucking insane! Insane! Please, forgive me. I'm repenting to you. I beg of you. I'm not evil. I'm fucked up. Please. Don't cry, okay? Statice? A forever flower. It's for you. For me? For you. How did you know? I know the name of every single blossom in this whole forest. Every tree, every plant, all of them. I'm gonna go back to school and study botany. It's the whole science of all these beautiful plants and flowers. I knew it. You're the romantic type. You don't belong with those monsters. No. No. I don't, I'm not a monster. I'm not like them. They're just a bunch of fucked up, inbred. They're just fucking bumpkins. I was born here but I'm not fucking like them. I'm not. And this whole goddamn hateful revenge thing, it never fucking ends! There's no end to it! Yeah. Yeah. And that is why our good Lord, he commands us to forgive the unforgivable. I'm... I'm the unforgivable. An eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. Everybody blind. Thank you. Will you take me back to New York City? I would love to take you back to New York City. I know a secret road out of here. We could get away tonight. We could escape. I'd like that a lot. Yeah, I love New York City. It's the coolest place. I'm saved me up a couple thousand bucks doing odd jobs, you know? I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna open the most famous flower shop they've ever seen. They oughta love flowers there. I mean, there's not much nature there, you know? It's true, there's not. There's really not. Yeah. I think a flower shop is a lovely idea. Lovely idea. So, so Herman's, Herman's dead? He's really dead? How did you know? How did you know? Because I killed him with a sickle. I stabbed it deep in his big fat back and then as a bonus, I put a bullet into his head. You didn't. Hell yeah, I did. Oh my God. Please, it was... it was gruesome. Please, no more talk about that, all right? Yeah. No more talk about that. Good. You're so beautiful. You're so beautiful. Remember, remember when you called me "sweet juice?" And you asked me if I had some more. I remember, I remember, yeah. Well I do now. Do you? I mean, Christy, I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

I got my mother's genes but I ain't got her patience and I don't resort to trickery. I got straight for the balls. Why'd you do that? You didn't have to do that, you didn't. It ain't fair, I ain't got no gun. Just a fucking knife. Just a fucking knife! It ain't no match for your gun, it ain't! What're you gonna do to me now? I did nothing to deserve this! I was dragged into this mess by Becky and Herman and Kevin and I'm sorry. I'm sorry, look! I'm sorry I was too chicken-hearted not to listen to them. I know you won't believe this but I was gonna, I was gonna drive you back! I was gonna drive you back to New York City in my van and just take you home, I was gonna take you home. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what we did to your mother. Please, I'm too young to die! Too fucking young! I know it ain't your fault, you're innocent! You're innocent, I swear! Don't. Hey! You fucking psycho bitch! You're fucking sicker than your mother! You're fucking sicker! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Kevin! Fuck you, asshole! Fuck. Where is my mother? Drop it. What have you done with her? Tell me! The next one goes into your fucking head. You fucking crazy bitch! Where is my mother?! You better speak up or I'm gonna punch a whole in every bone in your freaking body and then I'm gonna rip off your flesh, piece by piece! You don't only got his eyes. You're fucking bullheaded too. Okay, kid-o, okay! You wanna know what I did with your mamma? You wanna know? I dumped her in a fucking grave and then I spat on her, the same fucking grave I'm gonna dump you! Hear me, dear God! I'm killing the daughter of the messenger of Satan! Kill her to wash away my husband's guilt! Die, child. Die. So that Johnny's sins can die with you! What the fuck are you doing, you dumb moronic assholes! You gotta get her, her, not me! Dispatch her to fucking hell! Fucking hell! Yes, dear, yes. This is where we're gonna dispatch you too.

We'll show you. Come on. Come, dear, come before it gets too late. Look at this old fart, dancing like a drunken monkey! Hey, Henry! Do a crotch grab! Make it look like you got something there. Come on, sweetie, follow us. Take a swig, hon, it'll calm your nerves. Thanks. Ain't she beautiful, Henry? I'm what? Not you! You look like an old, rotten baked potato! She likes baked potatoes? I do too. But only them yummy sweet ones. Nobody gives a shit what kind of veggies you like. Just keep your goofy eyes on the road. Yes, dear. I'm getting on in years too but I ain't screwed up here. Not yet, anyway. Henry, loud! What's the occasion, Henry? Trying to shine up to the young lady? Last time this old fart helped me out of an automobile was on our wedding night. Not true, not true. I still do. Only when you wanna get in my panties. Henry, you ain't gonna fuck me tonight or any other night. This pothole is sealed with rust and dust. You can't break into it even with a jackhammer, let alone your fucking puny, lifeless prick! Come, dear. Come, sweetie. Follow us. It's all over now, Mother. I made those bastards pay for what they did to you. And for what they did to me. I love you so much, Mom. I'm gonna give you the most beautiful funeral and the biggest that New York City has ever seen. With lots and lots of flowers. Which one is my, my father? Mom, I uh, I get the picture now. I understand why you never wanted to tell me. You didn't want me to feel like dirt. You were afraid that I would be obsessed with the fact that the seed from which I was conceived was evil. But, Mom, I already knew. I always knew. But hey, Mom, I don't want you to worry anymore now, okay? Because now that it's clear in my mind, I want you to know that I am yours and I am only yours. And I am mighty proud of it. I wanna take her home now. Will you help me? We sure can, dear. You can even borrow old Lucy, here, to take her with you. Old Lucy, she's been with us since we got married. We aint guaranteeing she'll make it as far as New York City but it's all we got. Well, I'll bring her back to you, I promise. Then again, maybe I'll just junk her and buy you a brand new pickup. How sweet of you. Sweet, sweet. Very sweet. Lift the board up, Henry. Yes, dear. Oh, Mom. Mom. Mom. Help me! Help me! Help me! Die, child, die, child! Die! Die! Die! Don't you dare! Die! Repent, child! Repent! For the Kingdom of Heaven is forthcoming! Repent! Repent! Repent! I come not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance! Joy shall be in Heaven over one sinner that repents. Repent, ye child, repent or you shall be doomed in Hell! Doomed! Doomed! Doomed in Hell! Doomed in Hell! Who so sheds man's blood by man shall her blood be shed! Shall her blood be shed! Shed! Shed! Shed your blood! Repent! Repent! Vengeance is mine, I shall repay, saith the Lord! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth! A hand for a hand, a foot for a foot! A life for a life! Amen! Amen! You shall both be doomed! Mother and child! Doomed until the end of time! Doomed until the end of time! Doomed! Mother and child! Doomed until the end of time! Die! Die! Die! Doomed! Doomed! Doomed! Doomed! Doomed! Doomed! Until the end of time! Doomed! Doomed Doomed! Hey, Johnny, Papa's here, speaking to you. And your momma too. Mathew, it's your grandma, you hearing me, boy? We got her, oh, we got her! Yes we did! We got the bitch, boys! We got her good! And her daughter too! We got your daughter, Johnny. Our bastard granddaughter, Johnny! Johnny, Matthew, Andy, Stanley! Oh hear me! You can now rest in peace forever and ever, amen! Amen. Amen. Here, fellas, take a swig. Time to cheer up! Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. Fear no evil! Fear no evil! For though art with us, thy rod and they staff comfort us. - They Comfort us, they comfort us! And the Lord went before us in a pillar of cloud to lead us the way. To lead us the way, to lead us the way! And by night, in a pillar of fire, to give us light. To give us light, to give us light! My soul shall be joyful in the Lord, it rejoices in his salvation. It rejoices in his salvation! Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. Fear no evil! Fear no evil! For thou art with us, thy rod and thy staff. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Amen, Amen! The Lord goes before us. My soul shall be joyful in the Lord. It rejoices in His salvation. Stop that fucked up Holy Bible crap! Look what she done to my face. Oh no. Look! Oh no! Oh no! My savor, Jesus Christ, where are you? What am I to do now without you? What? What? Go ahead, child. Do what you gotta do. But first let me say a prayer. A prayer to save you. To free you of the evil spirits that dwell in your body and soul. Or else, you, like your mother, will be lead straight into Satan's kingdom. Oh, you say a pray for yourself, you goddamn miserable old fool! Why don't you repent?! You! No prayer for you, child. You ain't deserve it. Because you're doomed. Doomed to the everlasting fire of hell. My life ain't worth no goddamn shit now without my beloved wife. Ain't worth no goddamn shit. Now go ahead. Pull the trigger. Pull it. Keep us together in death as we was in life. Dispatch us to the Kingdom of Heaven. Oh, I will. First, you gotta keep your promise to me. You be good to old Lucy, here. She don't need much. Just dump plenty of Mobile 1 down her throat to quench her thirst. She'll keep on going. They don't make them like this no more. I kept my promise, young lady. It's your turn to keep yours. So be it. Forcing a man to go on living without his beloved wife aint but a cruel and heartless punishment, child. It's all in these Almighty's hands, all. Reckon He wishes me to go on living because He wants me to witness the day His wrath descends upon you. The mighty wrath of God. May God have mercy on you, my dear grandchild. And may He have mercy on you too, dear grandpa. I ain't come to ask you for your forgiveness. I did what I did. An eye for an eye. That's in your bible. Mom? Mom? Mom? Is she here? Mom? Mom? Let me go check over here on the side. Mom? Where could she be? I don't know. She's usually here at this time. I don't know. Isn't that grandpa's old Lucy? That was really odd. That was definitely his truck. But who was that girl? I don't know. I've never seen her before. Subtitles by explosiveskull
