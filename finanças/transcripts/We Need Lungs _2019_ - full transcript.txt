I guess I've always had this urge, this drive to get out and explore, to really see the life beyond the things that are in front of us. You'll find that when you do that, and you're also performing at the peak of your abilities, you enter this zen-like clarity where you feel like you're being absorbed into the universe. You blend into your surroundings and you start to feel everything. You take energy from everything that is around you, and you have complete freedom. And in your mind, an absolute control of your body. It's quite a magical place. It sounds very philosophical, but it's this magical pursuit, and it can be sought, but it can never be held for very long. So it's something that you'll keep doing and you'll keep looking to reach when you get out in the mountains, in the nature. And so this is essentially why I do these challenges, I push myself, I push the line, is to explore, discover, and reach the zone where your mind is free and you have complete control of your body. And so this is, I guess, the reason why I do it in general. And then there's a reason why we're here now, why we're here today. We're here today because I wanted to do this challenge, which is crossing the Pyrenees. We're going from north to south. We're looking at 900 kilometers, 60,000 meters of quality climbing, so 60,000 meters up, 60,000 meters down, and it's in the fastest time possible. Hopefully, in under 10 days. It's going to be mainly me running and then there's a group of friends along the way, supporting and guiding me. And there's another side of the story why we're here today, and why we're doing this challenge, and it's to bring awareness to cystic fibrosis, which is a particular disease which impairs the way you breathe, and it's a genetic disease, and there's no cure for it. The other thing is to help this foundation that I'm very close to which helps children, teens, and young adults that are underprivileged, socially disadvantaged. Both will give me the strength to put one foot in front of the other and really push myself when the challenge gets tough. I'm Bill O'Connor. I'm a UIAGM mountain guide. Now I live in Switzerland, where I work as a mountain guide, and previously worked both as a mountain guide and as a teacher at a school called Aiglon College, which is an international school. And in fact, it's the place where I first met Seba. Sallie O'Connor is my wife, my partner. We've been married for 35 years. We've known each other for more than 40 years, and we climb together. She's a very good climber. She's very good in the mountains. And spectacularly good at adventure. Okay, on a trip like this, Seba is very fortunate to have with him a group of friends. So Ambre is a girl that he knew when he was at school at Aiglon College, and they were good friends then, and they remain good friends. And Martin is a friend of Ambre, and he was her friend since childhood. They've known each other since they were this big, and they are both very sympathetic to this kind of thing. But more importantly, he's a physiotherapist, somebody that deals with sport injury through massage, through chiropractic, through all the sort of alternative techniques that help athletes recover from extreme and hard work, so whether it's through massage, whether it's through manipulation. Granite is a mad dog, alright. That's all I can say. It's a mad dog that chases anything that moves. And if you sit still, it licks you. If you run, it barks and chases. If you're riding by on a bicycle, it will come and eat the tires off your bike. That to Seba and what's great about this is that we've come together. I taught Seba. When I first knew him, he was 14 years of age. And so really there's a harmony in the group. We've all known each other, one way or another, either through school or friendship, but that's how we've come together, because it's a group of people and a team of people that like the whole idea of this extreme adventure. Our involvement, Sallie and I, it came about when Seba came to visit us earlier in the year in Switzerland, and he said he was going to do this adventure and was asking my opinion, and asking advice, and also asked whether or not we would get involved to help him plan the trip, in terms of logistics, i.e. to plan the actual route, to look at the kind of stages that he might be able to deal with, and at the same time, to support him along the way so that Sallie and I would make sure that, from A to B, there was enough and the necessary provisions, whether it was some water because there was no water en route, or whether there was a need to resupply his food, because some of the days are quite extreme, quite prodigious. And the idea was to try and cover the 900 kilometers in nine days, so that we would do 100 kilometers of running every day, plus whatever the vertical ascent and descent is. The problem with the classic route is that if you do that, there are days when you will do 100 or maybe 98 kilometers, but you'll also go up 8,000 meters, down 8,000 meters, which is just an enormous asking for anyone to do day after day after day. And maybe on some of the days, you have to run for maybe 15 hours, you may be on the move. You start at 5 o'clock in the morning, working in the dark, using a head torch, and you won't finish until after dark. For me, one of the descriptions of an adventure, is that the outcome is unknown. Unlike a holiday where you say, "Oh, yes, we leave on Friday. On Tuesday, we're here, then we're there. We'll have dinner there, we'll go there." Everything is known on a well-planned trip. But the difference between a trip and an adventure is that with an adventure, the outcome is unknown. We don't know if this is possible. We don't know if it's possible physically, whether it's possible for Seba. And there are lots of factors. Factors like bad weather. Already, we've had colossal storms on the way. You never quite know on something like this what impact that's going to have on your body, not only physically but also mentally. Do you see that blue line? It will come up very clearly. See this?-- Ah, okay, okay. Perfect. Yeah, perfect. [inaudible] Yeah, [inaudible]. Yeah. [inaudible] (speaking Italian). He's [our] conditioned, and now it's the trail. Yeah, just I... I went up and I looked at you guys like fuck, and it was not, come back down. Twice-- - Oh no. - Did you? So now it's this way. Right, what you'll do is you'll go down the hill to the roundabout, you'll turn a left, and then there's a park that rises, and it goes up there, I think. - I think that is it. - Okay. Doing that, okay? I'll go down and stop on the path. Okay. - So that you can see it, okay? - Super. There are days when Seba is totally alone on sections of the journey. And I know from my experience, having spent my whole lifetime in the mountains, more than 50 years climbing in the Alps, more than 50 years climbing mountains elsewhere, the psychological effect of days when you don't feel good, or when small things can get in the way, and this is when you really need to have resilience. That's something I know Seba has. If you're going to cover 900 kilometers and all those ups and downs in a nine-day trip, you can't do that carrying a huge backpack. You have to travel light. And ultra running, ultra-distance running is about traveling light through difficult landscapes, and going with the absolute minimum. But not just the minimum, you also have to draw a fine line for safety reasons, with the essential minimum, the sort of things that if things go wrong, you can still support yourself enough. Ay ay ay. Did you fall over? No, no, just [stopped.] - He's had a bit of a fall in the bush. - Oh, Seba! [inaudible] Sallie and I can support the in-between moments. We can meet him at roadheads. We can get into position, en route, to support that, go ahead and book accommodation, or whatever it is, which means you don't have to carry a tent, you don't have to use a bivouac or whatever, if the huts are not on part of your route. And there are mountain huts all the way along this and gîte d'étapes, and things like that. I'm just trying to work out how best to rearrange the route. Alright, there's an interesting thing here. There is a very famous bridge crossing a gorge, a suspension bridge, in here. They wanted it to access the big forests here, so it's in the Gorge of Holzarte, and they brought in Italian engineers in 1913 here, to make this big suspension bridge. My responsibility, really, is in route planning. And as the days go on, and having done an initial plan, what you're then trying to do is to look at each day and say, "Hang on, we've made another 10 kilometers. We can push on." Or, we haven't quite made the day. We're now 15 kilometers short. Which means, either we add on or we have to look for the possibility of making some deviation, some variation in the GR10 to allow us to get to our final destination, our objective, which is the Mediterranean at Banyuls. If he's on the route and he left the bridge, he can only be there, Sallie. I'll see if I can get in touch, see if I can find out if Seba's anywhere. No, he's not picking up. He'll be alright. Okay. We'll need to just change today's plan slightly because we've lost a couple of hours here. Ah, phone! Hi, Seba. Bill, yeah, hi. How are you? Good. I'm making my way down. Down? Or are you going down to the river now? Yeah. And then you'll climb up the other side where there should be the road where you can meet us, okay? Okay. Are you alright? Do you need me to come down? No, no. It's fine. Alright. It's raining now. I have to put a jacket on. It's raining? Oh, it's dry, it's not raining here. Okay? I would be okay to do another leg but it depends on how the leg is. You go along the road-- Or you could get to here but you won't do another leg, a proper leg from here. Okay. I'll explain it to you. The next stage is 12 Ks, 1200 meters of ascent. Mm-hm. Small descent. Four hours forty is the normal time, and I think now, we'll have a problem if we don't have accommodation, we don't have-- it's very unwise. I think if we were to continue now, it's just too late. It'll be-- it's still a climb, but it's not like this. It's up this road. - But it's still uphill. - We'll keep it for tomorrow. I think it makes sense to me but I actually think you would benefit from getting some food, getting some-- we can easily do this, but you need-- No, it's fine. We'll keep this for tomorrow. You'll blister the backs of your feet. You know, we'd be there and back, 8:30, I think. Do we know? 8:30 at least. By the time you eat and get everything, for me I would prefer to spend that time making tomorrow good, okay? Because otherwise all you do, you make a mistake, a small mistake now-- And you pay. Along the way, I also have the responsibility because... lots of reasons and one, I'm a mountain guide, and have a lot of experience through my own expeditions in the Himalayas and various mountains of the world, I will make decisions for general safety. If I think it's not going to be safe to do a particular leg because of weather conditions, or because of time, or because of Seba's physical condition, then I'll draw a line there, and say to him, "We need to hold it here." And he understands that because we spoke about that before we ever set out on this adventure, that if I'm engaged to be part of the team, then that's a responsibility I feel I have to take on. Some of the times were slightly slower than I expected. But it's a hard day, very hard day, and the temperature and the humidity is being quite difficult. He was going very well this morning in the cool of the morning, but this last section down to Borce, the distance was reasonable, the ascent was 1200 meters. And then it was a long descent, quite complicated [technically]. But then he had a little fall and the-- Yeah. He went... on a rock. So now nothing. He took off and we met him again at the start of the difficulty. We gave him some more drink and some more food. He was in good spirit. There are a couple of possibilities to get over the Coll, and one is a very difficult but very fast. And if everything is alright, what time he should finish? I would expect, with a bit of luck... Nine? Nine, ten. This terrain in the dark, for him, I'm unhappy with him alone. But it's a beautiful place, huh. Look at this. Beautiful, yeah. When I first met him, he was quite a mischievous teenager. He was 14 years of age. He was very, very strong, and was full of energy. But it wasn't very well channeled. And one of the things that Seba could do as a schoolboy was to get into mischief. Both Sallie and I were able, through teaching and through the things that we did at Aiglon, were able to channel his energy into training, into adventure, into having realistic but challenging objectives in your life. What kind of student he was? Not a very good one, and he was always in trouble. Yeah? Almost had to be expelled from school. Okay. He was very physical with people, and he was very strong for a boy. But he was always a bit rough with others. - With the others? - A bit bullying. So he was a bit naughty. But very quickly, within a while, it really changed, and he had focus and then was made house captain. Oh, he was? The house captain? - Yeah. - Okay. And was very good in just competing hard in sport and training. - And encouraging-- - And running? - Yeah. - Just a bit? But encouraging the others, and that's what made the house successful. We made a house motto which was: "to serve, to strive, and not to yield." To strive for something important, and be the best you can be. And to say to them, there's more in you than you know. Okay? There is more in you than you know, and you must strive to be the best you can [inaudible]. And then you have real satisfaction in your life, because at the end, if you look back and you think, "Oh, I could have done this, I could have done that, but I did nothing." When you live in a house together, you are a family. They were my family. I woke them up in the morning, put them to bed at night, Ate three meals a day with them. How many students you had in your house? To begin, 52 boys. - In your house? - Yeah, 52. So that's huge. Yeah, big house. A lot of children. A lot of problems. Teenage boys, teenagers, generally, do silly things. But that's what schools are for. Schools are to allow you to make mistakes and learn, whatever it is. Whether it's mathematical mistakes or just behavioral mistakes, school is about making them and learning from your mistakes. Seba did that, absolutely. And one of the great things from our point of view as his teachers is that he responded incredibly to challenge, and has come back now, after having left school many years ago to do this challenge. And I think that no matter what the outcome is at the end, it's been, so far, a fantastic success. There's still a long way to go to get to the coast at Banyuls, but we're well into that adventure. What's against us is perhaps the weather, perhaps the unknown, but we'll deal with that tomorrow. And that's the great thing about adventures because it gives you an opportunity every day, every day, to use your initiative, use your self-reliance, all the camaraderie and the support of a good team. I'm so happy, but you were so positive. Had you, when we got to Borce, I was getting a different vibe, then the plan would have changed. But you made the plan, not me. You were so strong. That was great. Made for it. Made for it. Okay? More in you than you think, huh? Exactly. All it takes is all you got. Yeah. Wow. Catchphrase. That's it. And that to me is what expeditions, the best of expeditions, bring out of humans-- the best of human qualities. Any person that wants to run 900 kilometers and has the oomph, the sort of motivation to do it, is pretty independent and strong-willed. They don't have minds that change easily. They can put one foot in front of the other and just keep doing it when most of us would quite like to go off for a cup of coffee and a hot lunch. So you always have to understand not just the technical thing but also the person you're dealing with, the psychology of that person, the sort of mindset. And one of the great things about having spent your life in the mountains is that I've come across a lot of people with some very focused ideas about achieving an objective, people that are willing to go to the limit to achieve the outcome. Seba's one of those people. He's a very strong-minded, very strong person. He's willing to put up with a lot of discomfort, a lot of physical pain, to put one foot in front of the other. It's not broken, though. It's just gone back through, but it's not broken and not bleeding. He's got-- look at his feet. They look like they-- I can see here. But the skin is not broken, which is good. Just so that we can spend some time in repairing and looking after. When I look at the state of his feet after 600 kilometers, I know a lot of people, probably myself included, who would have stopped 200 kilometers ago. So that's quite impressive. Being the sort of-- the role I have, it's trying to marry all the things-- the route, the safety, the person, the psychology of the person engaged in the actual task. So I think when I was climbing up in the snow and I was sliding, so like... do like... I don't know what it's called in English, but it's in Italian it's (speaking Italian). - (speaking Italian)? - Yeah. Because their motivation is absolutely essential to achieving the outcome. If this opens, I'm fucked. [inaudible] the blister? - And between the-- - It's not open. No, but if it does, you're fucked. Let's have a look. It's not going to [stay there]. Oh! You alright? It's stinging now. That was just painful. I just put it on the heels then. I don't want to hurt you. If they're not motivated, if they're not willing to put up with the pain and the discomfort, they're never going to do it. They'll give up long before the pain and the discomfort gets to a point most of us would. So people that do these things are people that I think have a very special psychology, very special physiology. Simply to be able to run 100 kilometers is pretty amazing, basic fitness, but also that stoic thing of just putting one foot in front of the other. A very famous mountaineer called Bill Tilman, one of the greatest moutaineers, with Eric Shipton, used to say that he's noticed that a lot of climbers on big mountains suffered from mountaineer's foot. And I asked him what he meant by that and he said it was the inability to put one foot in front of the other. It's a terrible disease when you catch it in the mountains. You just don't want to go on. And Tilman, he was making a joke, but he called it mountaineer's foot, and it was simply, I said, "I've never heard of that disease." He said, "Yeah, I think you might have. It's when you can't put one foot in front of the other anymore." Seba is the sort of person that can put one foot in front of the other when the rest of us, perhaps, would not want to. One of the big problems with a journey like this-- an expedition, an adventure-- is that the person doing it is, for most of the time, alone. And for a lot of people that's really difficult. Most of us quite like company. Most of us like to have someone to share the decision-making. That's quite hard. Now, Seba has got a team of us around him, but when he starts running early in the morning, he's essentially alone. Once he's set off up into the mountains, he has to make his own decisions. He has to make his own route now. You can use a GPS, or whatever, but new technology like the GPS isn't going to help you if it's broken, and then you're on your own. So doing an adventure like this, you've got to balance all sorts of things. One, you're on your own so even once you're up and away in the mountains, in the more remote areas, a simple slip, a twisted ankle, a knee that has been twisted, becomes a serious thing. So Seba does carry bivouac protections-- have down jackets and fleece clothing. He's essentially in specialist mountain running shoes, he's wearing shorts, he carries water, he carries food, and he also carries a simple device which will allow us to pinpoint his position. And we insisted on that for safety reasons because we are cutting very fine, the sort of equipment. And ultra-distance runners, solo mountaineers, people that go alone, are breaking one of the old rules in mountaineering, if you like, of not going alone, of having partners, of having someone to-- part of a team on the mountain to help you in times of adversity. Well, when you do a solo thing like this, you don't have that. So you're called upon yourself, and that's where I said, time and again, you need a special kind of a person to be able to deal with that situation, to be able to make decisions under pressure. Decision-making, when you have all the time in the world, when you're sitting down in a chair and you say-- it's easy. But when the pressure's on, all of us know that decision-making becomes difficult. And when you're running and making decisions about where your footing's going, whether it goes here or there, that's pressurized activity. Maybe it's not the same as running a multinational banking organization, but the outcome could be very serious if you get things wrong. Serious because you don't complete the task. Serious because you don't arrive where you're supposed to sleep, or you get lost. Serious because you could be injured. So I see that as really, one of the characteristics that people that do this kind of activity really need to have-- they need that special personality, that special factors. There are plenty of people who are very fit, plenty of people that can run, but to marry those qualities with the ability to be in a wild environment, that's a different person altogether. Martin. Martin! No, we can't go here. No, no, no. No, no, no. We have to find shelter. No. We have to spend the night here. We'll sleep in the hut. Okay, yeah. The greatest mountaineers go to climb a mountain like Everest or K2, or whatever, and they fail, or they have a problem. It's not the climbing, it'll be the things you can't control. Always. But that's the nature of adventure. If you knew perfect outcome every time, that's not an adventure, that's a certainty, it's like-- A walk in the park. Backing on a one-horse race-- it's going to win. Couldn't have to walk, it can still win. If you had to sleep out last night, it would have been-- We're lucky because, I was telling them before, we went back and forth a few times. And then when we came back to the hut, I looked if there was any doors open, and the only one was the bathroom. So I said, well, worst case scenario, we sleep in the bathroom-- it's inside. And because Martin was like, "The door is shut." And because he was pulling the door, then I pushed the door and it opened, and we're like, "Yes!" So we were wet, we just took everything off and said go look if there's any space and there were a few beds and we just took everything off. Didn't eat anything, just... There's a kind of rule in the mountains that is you have to prepare early for the night, because if you don't, you get caught out. So that, I think, is the thing to do, is to be sensible. There's also a bit of me that, how much benefit you will get from not pounding your feet along some roads today. It's something we need to think and talk about. That's something that it's difficult to talk to you because I know you're in go mode. Okay? And I don't want to affect your psychological go, go, go, which I know you're in. But as a-- I can only give you my thinking on it as someone that's often done go, go, go. For most people, this journey is a minimum of 60 days. Most people do this journey over their holidays over several years, maybe taking three or more years to do this journey. So here we're just trying to do it in nine days. One of the things that I remember talking to Seba about a long time ago was this idea of if you remember something, it's six letter Ps, and what do they stand for? Practice, preparation, and planning prevent poor performances. And those six things, if you remember your preparation, you do your planning and you practice, you prevent a poor performance. And that's what I'm seeing in action with Seba now. This is not a poor-- this is a fantastic performance. One I would've been proud, in my youth, to have done. In doing a journey like this, you're trying to marry the fact that you've got an athlete who has got to prepare for something that is really hard to prepare the body for, without doing it. So Seba does that-- he trains, he runs. But it's really hard to prepare the body for the absolute pounding, day after day, of 100 kilometers, plus 6,000 meters of up, 6,000 meters of down. It's really hard to prepare for that. And Seba trains twice a day. And in that training, he has pushed himself. He pushed himself on things like the Marathon des Sables. He's pushed himself at runs around his home in Italy. But no matter how much you prepare, how much you physically put into it, the psychological factors are the things that it's very difficult to prepare for. Some days, after six, seven hours, you may only have pulled for two kilometers. So you would be putting huge amounts of energy simply to go a few kilometers. And what you realize is that you can do that on pretty low level of fuel, of calories, but only for a day or two, because after that, you get diminishing returns. Your body no longer recovers from fatigue, from tiredness, from small injuries. Your body no longer is able to sustain the kind of effort that you demand of it. So one of the things that we spoke about with Seba was how are we going to make sure that you get enough fuel on board. And one of the problems with running 100 kilometers is that you often don't feel like eating during the day. It's easy to get an upset stomach. You do need to take on a lot of liquid because we're in temperatures of 30, 31 degrees, at one point, when we set off. And when you're running, hour after hour, your body, your core temperature goes very high and it's then that you really need to have the fuel on board. It's then that you need to make sure that you're getting the right kind of calories. Without it, you get the diminishing returns. So you put in the same hours but you really cannot maintain the effort required to cross these mountains in the time available. We discussed it, and we think we've come up with the right solution. And on top of which, it's got to be food that you want to eat, it's got to be food-- because as you get tired, physically tired, you often get what are called taste reversals. And what you really enjoyed eating when you were sitting at home, watching television or reading a book, no longer appeals to you. All of a sudden, you want something that's really salty, or something that's got a strong taste. Or maybe you can't stand strong tastes, and you want something that is just bland-- a piece of bread-- because your stomach feels too fragile. So all of these things, the complex things, dealing on a challenge like this, and it's something that you have to be responsive to during the challenge. The other thing is that you have to be in top physical form. You've really got to have the right kind of muscle structure, you've got to have the right kind of build to do this work. Not everyone can do it. Seba, as you see, he's got a light body, long limbs, he can cover the ground pretty easily. And he's got the right kind of psychological response. The other thing is that he's got a great set of lungs and he's lucky to have those because he can pound out mile after mile, and has the cardiovascular and the cardiorespiratory fitness to be able to do that kind of thing, where most of us would be sucking air, particularly at altitudes. Two and a half thousand meters may not be that high, but when you're running hard, 2,500 meters puts a huge demand on your lungs. Before we came on this, I was speaking to people that knew Seba at school, some of his teachers, and he said, "He must be absolutely crazy! Even thinking about running 900 kilometers across mountains, I mean, what is he thinking about. Has he gone really mad?" I said, "You know, it's a wonderful kind of madness, this, that you have something that inspires you, that there is something in your life that is really... you're passionate about." And I think that all of us need a passion in life, whether it's painting, or writing, or doing service, whatever it is. And the wonderful thing here is that Seba is able to combine a passion, a passion for ultra-distance running, a passion for mountains, with a desire to do something very good for charity. For me, this is a wonderful kind of madness because it combines all the best things that I would expect of a fellow, another human being. It combines somebody with a passion, a passion for something they're willing to work hard for, something they're willing to put time and energy into, with focus, with a love of the outdoors, a love of nature, but at the same time, they're willing to do it in the service of others, in terms of trying to help other people, less fortunate than themselves. And that, to me, is the very best of people, the very best of humanity, and I think that's what something like this can inspire, can achieve. And so for me, Seba's madness is a beautiful madness because I wish more people had that kind of lunacy. [inaudible] I got the... Here? Like a-- what happened? Nothing. [inaudible] - Just, I started climbing. - Okay. Came back. This [inaudible]. It doesn't hurt as much when you climb, that. It's more just because you're lifting this. [inaudible] Okay. Can you finish the day with this, or do you want me to have a look at it? I can definitely finish the day, but I think [inaudible]. Yeah. For me, that came from this. This came from that, and this from that, so it's like linked here. I think there's no point between that and that. It's like-- - Separate. - Different. One of the problems with any journey like this, you can plan for most things, you can plan for problems with the route, problems with difficulty with food, difficulties with almost anything. It's always a problem, of course, in the mountains, dealing with weather. You have to do that. But one of the real unknowns of a journey like this, a journey that's really physically hugely demanding, is how the body is going to deal with the immense effort of day after day, pounding out the kilometers, trying to knock up 70, 80, 100 kilometers a day. And unfortunately, for Seba, he's taken a pounding, and his shins and his calf have literally splintered with the effort of pounding the roads, and pounding the rocky footpaths, and pounding the mountains. We got up this morning and Seba put on a brave face. I went to see him at about 5:30 and he said, "Oh, yup, I'm ready to go." But it was pretty obvious when I looked at his legs, that they were full of swelling and that the legs themselves were absolutely rock hard and tight, and it was very, very hot. And we were a bit worried. We were worried because we knew that he was beginning to show the signs of what are called shin splints where little tears, micro tears occur in the muscles, and even in the bone sheath itself. But more than that, we were worried that there was perhaps a stress fracture in his lower leg. My feeling is that the consequences of this fantastic adventure have resulted in an injury that Seba can do nothing about. He did another 25 Ks this morning, but there was far too much pain. And I quite literally said, "It's time to stop. This can't go on, it's ridiculous. You're going to do more damage to yourself. And what's the point?" There is this... I had to remind him that sometimes it's not about the destination when you undertake a great journey, it's often more about the journey itself. And you learn a lot more about yourself than outright success. Again, I had to remind him of a quote that Ed Hillary once said. After he climbed Everest-- he made the first ascent of Everest with Tenzing Norgay-- he was asked about what it felt like to conquer a mountain, and Ed turned around and with all humility said that you never conquer mountains, you only conquer yourself. And I think that that's very true for Seba. Seba finds it very difficult to give up. It's why he was able to push on through the pain barrier. And I think that it will take him some time. I know right now he's feeling pretty depressed about the possibility that he can't continue. In fact, I don't even think he's accepted that fact yet, but I think that's the reality and it will dawn fairly soon. Once the doctor's had a word with him, once we've had a chat, I think he'll come to the realization that the adventure may be ending but the journey's still carrying on for him. The priority is not to do something stupid that spoils the rest of the year, the summer, your running career, alright? Sometimes, the mountains... win the day. And the right decision, the best decision is to pull the plug, stop, early rather than late. You can push it too late. And right now, what I want you to do is to go and see a doctor, okay? I can give you my advice. My best advice is, at this point, we stop doing what we're doing. And what I don't know is whether it's shin splints, whether it's a stress fracture. I can't tell you that and that's where you need a doctor. Yep. But I can tell you it's time to stop doing what we're doing. You know, we've covered over 600 kilometers, we've gone a stack of ups and downs, and the mountains are now telling you, giving you a really strong and clear message, Seba. What we do, adventures are never funny enjoyable, but they've got to be enjoyable. You've got to look forward to the next day and the next challenge. And when that runs out, it's time to pull the plug and say, enough. Yeah. I've said about-- Seba will have to come to terms with stopping. It's not easy for him. But I remember when I was a boy and my father gave me a copy of a poem by Rudyard Kipling. It's a poem called "If," and I think it's a good lesson by which to lead our lives. "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream and not make dreams your master; If you can think and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two imposters just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build them up with worn-out tools: If you can make one heap of all your winnings, And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings, And never breathe a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there's nothing in you Except the Will which says to them, 'Hold on!' And if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with Kings, nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And-- which is more-- you'll be a Man, my son!" It's a little hard right now to process every thought that is going through my head, as I see it as a little bit of a failure that I didn't get to the end how I wanted to get to the end. The lesson you take home in this case is that there's things you can plan, prepare, program, end up the way you wanted them to end up. Life doesn't come the way you want it sometimes to come. So what you have to do is take the unexpected, adapt, and turn it into something positive. Before I started the challenge, I sent an email to a group of friends and family, and the subject was "All it takes is all you've got" and I held true to it because I gave it all I could. I tried to walk it when I couldn't run anymore. I was going to walk the remaining kilometers, but now, even walking has proved impossible. But because quitting was never really an option, and all it takes is really all you've got, sometimes when life throws you lemons, you just have to keep pressing through, pushing through, and moving through, just in a slightly different way.
