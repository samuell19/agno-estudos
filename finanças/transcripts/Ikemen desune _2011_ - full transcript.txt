When you come back from Okinawa, the real Mio will join the band. Please take care of me. "Miss You" was supposedly written by the songwriter Sakuraba Takumi for his lover. Mizusaka Reiko told everyone it was written for her. I like you. I really like you. But... Every time I see you, Mizusawa-san's? your mother's face will definitely appear in my mind. I can no longer smile beside you. Farewell. - Shu-san, Miko hasn't contacted you too, right? - No. She really just left like that... I wonder where she could have gone. It's time for lunch, so everyone, wash your hands. - Okay! - Okay! Let's go. Miko, you're Mio's sister, right? Can't you meet with A.N.JELL? They're really busy, so we can't meet each other. What's with that... Are you all right? You seem down lately. It just feels like nothing matters anymore. Eh? - Good morning. - Good morning. Yuki-kun! I finally get to see you again! Wait, time out, I'm not one of you, I'm one of us! You're so shy, that's so cute! That's quite a gloomy face. It's nothing. It's not like I'm down because of you. Really? That's good then. Even though you're a lying fairy, there are tens of thousands people in this world who cheer up when they see your smile. Whatever happens, you have to keep smiling for them. That's what makes you Nana, right? Ren... -=I'll be counting on you for the recording tomorrow. Mizusawa Reiko=- Your mother must be really happy that you've come to see her. Your mother must be really happy that you've come to see her. But my mother too, died surrounded by sad memories. Knowing that her last days were spent in such sadness? I can no longer smile beside you. That's why I'll go somewhere where you won't see me. You're going to Africa? A nun who was my senior is volunteering there, and I'm going there to help her. You're going to leave without seeing Leader? Even if we meet, it'll just be painful for us. You haven't contacted any of the members, right? At least send them an email telling them you're fine? At least send them an email telling them you're fine? You're right. President, Mabuchi-san asked when his salary cut would be restored. When I've calmed down. Lying to me like that, he should be thankful that I didn't fire him. And? Did Mio's broken nose heal properly? Of course, it was per... I'm very sorry! Miko hasn't been found yet? No. It seems like she hasn't contacted anyone. Hasn't contacted anyone... Ren, you came to see me? Stop this nonsense! That song wasn't written for you, it was written for someone else. Clinging on to something like that... Isn't that pathetic? Pathetic? I stopped feeling that way long ago. You wouldn't understand. Loving someone who cares nothing for you... how painful it can be. No matter how pathetic it is, I want to leave some proof that I met and loved him. At least... in the last days of my life. Last days? A malignant tumor in her throat? She said she absolutely refused to lose her voice, so she wouldn't go for surgery even if it meant losing her life. Ren. You really are a terrible mother. How selfish can you be? I won't forgive you. For abandoning me, or what you did to Miko. I wonder why I'm the son of someone like you. But... however much I resent you, I can't change who my mother is now. So, at least this once, please behave like a mother, for my sake. Please go for the surgery. If you die like this, I will have to resent you for the rest of my life. Shu-san, look! - This could be... - Yes. -=To everyone in A.N.JELL Pig-Rabbit (20) Female 2011.9.14=- I'm doing fine. I'm very thankful to all of you who gave me wonderful memories. Even though I am far away from you, I'll keep watching you. Take care. Farewell. Does this mean you want to forget about us? Pig-Rabbit... In Fukuoka? Mio? I think Mabuchi-san asked him to go so that he can earn the appearance fee. What? Yo! Mabuchi-san? Why are you here so suddenly? Could it be... No, no. I didn't tell anyone you were here. I've told them I don't know where you are. I see. Then... Please! One more time, just one more time, please take Mio's place! please take Mio's place! Eh? The president told me that he has something to tell Mio and to go get him right away, but Mio is in Fukuoka on an assignment. Fukuoka? For various reasons, we're keeping it a secret from the president. If he finds out, he'll fire me for sure this time. So, please, help me! This is the situation! Please! Perfect. All right, let's go. Miko. I'm sorry I can't be of any help. That's... Rina-san's presence was very reassuring. You're really going to Africa? Yes. I like the way you're always giving your best. When you come back from Africa, let's go for a meal together. A girls' day out. Okay! You've come. Today I have something I want to tell you. Today I have something I want to tell you. I've said this before, haven't I? That it was a miracle that the 4 of you came together to become a team. That it was a miracle that the 4 of you came together to become a team. But God wasn't the one who created this miracle. But God wasn't the one who created this miracle. It was the 4 of you. All of you, each with your own strong beliefs, created this miracle called A.N.JELL. People who live their lives earnestly have an invisible power to move things. That's what I believe. The honest way you live moved Ren, Shu and Yuki's hearts, moved the hearts of the fans, and has moved your own life. Don't forget that. From now on too, live your life well. I'll be cheering for you. Wherever you may be. Um... President... That's all. Thank you very much. Take care. Tell your sister this. "I received the message." "I'm doing fine too, so it's okay if you forget me." Mio, are you all right? I'm sorry, Shu-san. Why is he so flustered? - "Shu-san"? - Hm? Mio always just calls me by my name, doesn't he? Ren, did you see Mio just now? I spoke to him a while ago. That was Miko! We can still get her! They're there! Ren! Yuki, look over here! Shu is so cool today! Hey... sorry for the bother. Thank you. It's fine. Well, a lot of things happened, but I enjoyed my time with you too. This is a ticket for the last concert. It's the day I leave for Africa. At least go and watch A.N.JELL before you leave. Thank you for taking care of me. Be sure to come, Miko. "I'm doing fine too, "so it's okay if you forget me." Mother Superior, forgetting about Ren-san is something I can't do. So the only thing I can do is to go far away. To a place where I can't see Ren-san no matter how hard I try. Excuse me, excuse me! Did you break up with Ren-san? Yes, we are both too busy... But there's a rumor that your relationship was fake. That's not true. We were really dating. From now on, I will do my best to smile even more for everyone. Please support me, okay? - Africa? - Africa? Yes, she's leaving tomorrow. This is something that can't be helped. Where is Miko right now? You know, right? Mabuchi-san. I... - Mabuchi-san! - Mabu-chan! Where is she? If you're asking where... I have decided to go for the surgery. I see. He may not have loved me, but he told me that he liked my voice. That's why I didn't want to lose this voice. But, I'll keep living. I want to live and make up for all the hurt I had caused you. I don't think you'll forgive me so easily, but just... let me say this. Ren, I'm sorry. I will apologize to Miko-san too. It's too late for that. Yes? Leader called me to ask me for the location of your mother's grave, Leader called me to ask me for the location of your mother's grave, so I told him. Well, he's doing this much for you that somehow, I was moved. =If you go now, you may be able to meet him.= =Won't you regret it if you don't go?= Even if we meet... it will just be painful. From now on, I will protect you. From now on, we're going to keep watching the stars together. Mother. Ren-san is a wonderful person, isn't he? He is the most important person to me. I really, really like him. I really want to always be with him, but because he's such a kind person, if we were together, he would definitely suffer too. So, I have no choice but to say goodbye. What are we going to do, Ren-san? She's going to Africa. You're not going to be able to see her anymore. There's nothing I can do. She rejected me. Why are you acting so cool about it? How have I... Why couldn't you just tell her not to go? You're just afraid of being hurt, right? That's right. Ren-san, you're surprisingly cowardly. You want to fight? She said this to me. She said that she could no longer smile beside me. I don't want to make her suffer anymore. Sakuraba-san. Mio-san, please look this way. This way, this way. Please answer this. Please tell us how you feel about the concert. He feels that he's finally made it here, so he wants to make the audience feel... Please come in. I'm sorry. Because of me, you had a hard time. I really wanted to apologize to you. The only person your father really loved was your mother, Saori-san. was your mother, Saori-san. We were... friends. She was always cheerful, and she really liked to sing. She was a person people could love straight away. When she was blessed with you both, she said this. "I didn't think that there could be such happiness in this world." "I didn't think that there could be such happiness in this world." My mother had happy moments too, right? Of course. If only I wasn't there... That's all right. As long as you understand that. You can't say that. I want to compensate you somehow. No. More importantly, would you listen to one request from me? Ren, it's about time to get changed. Hello? I'm about to go for the surgery. I see. Good luck. I just met Miko-san. Is she going somewhere far away? =She said she had one request of me.= She told me to never leave you, whom I had hurt so much, alone again. She told me to never leave you, whom I had hurt so much, alone again. =You said it was too late,= =but is that really the case?= Ren, there is nothing more joyful than having a person you love feel the same way as you. That's why I want you to cherish that. =I don't have the right to say this to you as a mother,= but I don't want you to have any regrets. Goodbye. Your voice... Your voice... I will try to remember it... Mother. Th-thank you. I still... Now you're talking! If you don't hurry, you won't make in time. All right! Ah! It's Ren from A.N.JELL! - Ren! - Ren! Where's Miko? She has already left. Um... She said she was going to see the star she liked the most. I'll just take a look before I go. These past months, we've done nothing but chase after A.N.JELL. On this last day of the tour I have a feeling something is going to happen. We're definitely not going to miss it. You dropped this. This is something important, isn't it? Thank you very much. Ren, did you manage to see Miko? Miko seems to be in the audience. Ren-san. Miko, where are you? 5 minutes until the concert starts. Did you find Miko? No. There are 15 000 people out there. I want to change the opening song. "Miss You". ~ The smile that was always by my side ~ ~ Because I can't forget it ~ ~ Before I realized it ~ ~ I went to our place even though I wouldn't meet you there ~ ~ "Goodbye", your trembling ~ ~ voice from that day is still stuck in my heart ~ ~ I can't go anywhere ~ ~ I can't even see a sign. ~ ~ To you, to you, there's something I want to say. ~ ~ Until the end, I couldn't say it ~ ~ One more time, one more time, if I can touch that hand ~ ~ I would hug you tight and never again ~ ~ I'll miss you ~ ~ let go of you ~ Ren-san, there were many things in this world I didn't know about. Being nervous, being excited... Moments so joyful they felt like a dream, moments so sad they felt as though my heart was being torn, the happiness and pain of falling in love with someone... I learned about them for the first time. The days I spent with you are memories so bright that they become dazzling. ~ Even though I've lost you ~ ~ Even though I've lost you ~ ~ Even though I've lost you ~ ~ Even though you're already gone ~ ~ To you, to you, there's something I want to say. ~ ~ Until the end, I couldn't say it ~ ~ More than anyone, more than anyone, I want to be beside you ~ ~ Even now, more than anyone else ~ ~ I love you. ~ Thank you, Ren-san. You'll always be the most important, the brightest shining star to me. Hey, you're here, right? Where are you? I realized this when you left. You said I was your star, but you were also always lighting up my heart. To me, a world without you is too dark for me to see anything. I told you to stay by my side, but why aren't you here? Why do you want to leave without saying anything? Really, you... you're a trouble-causing nuisance. But I... I can't lose sight of you! So... Come to a place where I can see you. Please, I want to see you! Give me permission to. Please turn on the lights in the audience area. Please. All right. Ren-san... If you wish from your heart, you can even catch the stars. The person who taught me that was you. All right, listen carefully. I love you. Somehow, I feel like crying. You've become quite self-important, haven't you? Making me wait like that. I can see the stars in Africa too. When I look at the stars, I'll think of you. Then I'll let you see stars that are even closer than those. For me? I'm so happy! Thank you very much! What? I feel like I'm being loved. Idiot. Don't be too full of yourself! Give it back! No way, I won't give it back! I will cherish it. Definitely? Definitely! I will also never let go of my important star. I'll be waiting for you. Okay. Ren-san! Welcome back. I'm back! Ren-san.
