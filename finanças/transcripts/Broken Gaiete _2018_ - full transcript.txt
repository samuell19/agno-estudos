(dark music) (wind blows) (footsteps squelch) [Man's voice] Where are we? [Woman's voice] Keep walking. (bird squawks) (cough) (multiple coughs) (birds squawk) [Idir] Come on. (groans) (water spills) (rocks clack) (somber music) [Idir] There. We go there. (moans) (suspenseful music) [Kashou] I need water. [Idir] We need water. [Idir] Hold on. [Idir] There is water there. [Pissog] We do not drink from there. Mother. [Pissog] This should be enough. [Idir] There's more. [Pissog] You die if you drink that, Asram, fungus and bugs. [Idir] No, we will not. That, that looks valuable. How did you get it? - [Idir] I- - We found it. [Pissog] I see. You are welcome to stay and rest for three days. One day is all we need. I can walk. [Pissog] Not many travelers here lately. Where are you going? North. I see. Where are you coming from? South. (laughs) Like birds. However, in the winter, they all wanna go back to the past. I mean, the south. There is no shame in survival. [Pissog] This is our guest tent. Remember, if you stay more than three days, we require an asiv. An asiv? To marry from our people. You must have seen the sign. [Kashou] We cannot read. No one can, but that's what it says. That is not what we seek. Of course. [Pissog] Food will arrive, shortly. [Idir] Thank you. (bird squawks) (wind blows) (dark music) [Idir] Mother, I think my mind has gone mad. [Kashou] We need to get rest. We will leave early in the morning. [Idir] To go where? (overlapping chatter) Don't say too much. (overlapping chatter) (hushed chatter) (food crunches) You must be very hungry. (growling stomach) [woman] Guest food is the best food (food crunches) (hushed chatter) We really do need to rest. (food crunches) They bring us food and you chase them away. Prying eyes and ears is what they are. Go get us some bath water. [Man's Voice] (muffled) She must be punished or killed. (melancholy music) (background chatter) [Villager] We are not going to question the men. (child giggles) (muffled chatter) Listen to me! Re... peat. (ominous music) (muffled crying child) Repeat. Repeat after me. My apologies. I did not mean to scare you. Forgive my intrusion. No, forgive my rudeness. I'm not feeling well. The sun and the demons of the desert can affect your mind. Must be the sun. You must seek our medicine. Medicine man Epoh. [Teacher] We are not to question the men. Repeat. Your village is so peaceful. The children are very respectful and obedient. The blessings of the golden book. Golden book? Yes. I don't understand. You don't have to understand. That is not our duty. The wise men have relieved us from that burden. Wise men? Yes. There, go inside. - Alone? - Only the sick can go inside. Remember, when you go inside, right foot first. You can go in. Just remember, leave your shoes outside. Having a child without a husband is a woman's fault, and she must be punished or killed. (children giggle) Repeat after me! (rhythmic scraping) [Epoh] You know the red powder is forbidden. [Beda] I know, Uncle. But this is the only way I can save someone I care for. (sighs) It's always the woman's fault. How long is she? Her first month. Why could they not just be wed? It's so early to tell. (Beda sighs) His parents are older than hers. I see. All he has to do is, deny, and she is, punished, or killed. [Epoh] Leave now. (rhythmic scraping) (bird squawks) I come to seek the medicine man. [Epoh] Shoes! Who are you? I'm a guest in your village. A foreigner. I woke up this morning in the desert with no memory of the past. I only remember my name and my mother's. Stop. I'm afraid time is what you really need. Water and rest for now. You must leave. - I was hoping- - I said you must leave now. (ominous tones) (Beda sobs) Why were you asking for the red powder? You know I have eyes and ears everywhere. Who is she? It hurts! Who is she? (Beda sobs) (distant yelling) (tense music) [Villager 1] This is my water! [Villager 2] It's my water, no! (Beda whines and sobs) (tense music) (villagers argue) Enough! Enough! [Hooded Man] Tsicar! This behavior is unacceptable. That man started this disturbance. [Hooded Man] Come. I don't understand- Travelers must obey our rules and the rule is not to drink from this well. I apologize. I will deal with this foreigner. No, no. What is your name, foreigner? My name is Idir. My mother and I are resting in your village, and for that, we are grateful. We live in order here. I could've told these people how to separate the bugs and the dirt from the water, but it would upset the gods, and you saw what happened when you taught them how to do it. The gods started to punish us. A man died. He left half to his son, one third to his daughter, and the book says that greed drives people apart. It is only by giving all away that we are on the path to unity. Go ahead, foreigner. Give her a third and give him a half. (strong wind blows) (somber music) Very well. The land is generous. It provides food, shelter, and it lets us borrow a rock. Now, half of six is three, and one third of six is two. That leaves us with the rock that the land so generously lent us. Now, we return the rock back to the land, and everyone is satisfied. This is not a game. You must leave our village now. Tsicar. Let this man remain our guest. - But- - Do as I command. And let no one, no one, harm this man or his mother. Mother! (water splashes) Before the desert... The foreigner. Reach out to him. Offer him a free stay and then keep a close eye on him. Our people will think that we favor outsiders over them. And if he is to stay, he must get an asiv like every foreigner before him. [Hooded Man] Then let us hope this is not a punishment sent down upon us. There is much you do not understand. Oh, I do understand. One lucky suggestion does not make him a god! What we need is obedience! Forgive me, please. I must go. (somber music) (strong wind blows) (water splashes) (rhythmic scraping) [Rouh] I sense anger. Foreigners should not be allowed here. You wouldn't exist if it wasn't for your foreign father. I told you before, Mother, I do not wanna hear about him. Why all the anger, then? Everything they ask of me, I do. Yet, in one moment, decisions were made without me. You're lonely, son. You need to find a woman and have children. Look what they did to you when you found a man and had a child. I broke the rules. My choice. Was it, Mother? Was it, really? You want obedience. You must command with what is possible. Beda. Come here. I haven't seen you in days. I brought you something. My favorite. Did you make this again? You are so good to me. I must find you a husband soon. (Beda chuckles) What's the matter, child? Nothing. I hope you see me as a mother. Of course, Mother. You have been there for me so many times. I must go now. Is there anything you need? I love you, child. (chuckles) I am always here for you. Remember, I'm the mother you didn't have. I know. I- - Beda! (Beda sighs) (somber music) Beda. (Beda sighs) (muffled chatter) (tense music) (bones crack) (pants) (grunts) I am with child. (dark music) What? What did you say? I am with child. (sobs) (sinister screaming) We must go. [Man] Do not listen to her. Who are you? What is this? [Kashou] Son, watch out! (thud) (wings flap) (crickets chirp) (owl hoots) (dark music) Idir. I must apologize for my behavior today. I would've reacted the same way. Tomorrow's our hunt day. If you like, you can join us. He is a farmer, not a hunter. Yes. I will go. Good. Dawn, at the water hole. Be well. Why would you say that? Mother. Sit down, son. (distant yelling) We had a little farm, on the outskirts of the village. One day, the slaves of our king began invading all of the villages. They burned and killed almost everyone. We packed what we could and we ran into the woods. One of their men, he saw us and he gave chase. Idir, hurry! Hurry, hurry! (Idir coughs) Hurry! (Idir coughs) Stop, stop, stop. (Idir coughs) Where is he? I think we lost him, Mother. Idir, Idir. Look, look! Look. (whooshing) (grunting) (Idir groans) (grunting) (groans) (thud) (groans) (thud) (knife slashes) (sharp thuds) You have never been a fighter. Farming is all you did. Hours later... You woke, not remembering anything. Not even that I was your mother. It was not easy convincing you. - When did this happen? - Many days ago. I have been telling you every day since, and I will tell you again, here, tomorrow. What is this for? Every time I speak of the past, your nose, it bleeds. Farmer? I pray every night that I do not have to repeat myself the next day. Farmer? Tomorrow, you may not remember everything I am telling you now, so please, get some rest. A long journey awaits us. We must reach your uncle's village in the north. It is our new home. I love you. My son. Tomorrow, you may not remember everything I am telling you now. I pray every night that I do not have to repeat myself the next day. (birds tweet) (distant chatter) Mother. Mother. Sleep makes me forget the day before. I must go, Mother. (tense music) (rhythmic thuds) Shh. (rocks clack) (rocks clack) (rhythmic thuds) (whooshing) (thuds) (creature snarls) (blood squelches) (creature squeaks) (somber music) Wake up. Time to move out. (insect buzzes) I saved your life. I remember. (chuckles) I can sleep now. You are a very strange man. We could use a guy like you. Today, I must admit, I felt alive. Good. That's all I need to hear. (hushed chatter) (men laugh) (muffled chatter) Move out! (laughs) (laughs) Move it! (lively percussive music) (chanting) [Woman] kiss me, kiss me [Kashou] No shame! [Kashou] We should've been on the road already. [Villager] Dance with me, dance with me. [Kashou] (yelling) Get off, Get off. [Idir] YEAH! (melancholy music) (lively percussive music) (lively percussive music) (Beda sighs) This is nice. If all your memories were lost, would you miss them? You can't miss what you don't remember. My mother wants us to leave this place. What must I do? No matter how I answer you, you will still do what you want to do. And I will be judged for my words later. I won't. For a silent woman has no place in my heart. Are you really a farmer? I don't feel like one, but I guess we are what we're told to be. Why do we accept? I don't know. Fear, maybe. Oh. (both chuckle) Stay. (ominous music) (fire crackles) Come, Tyro. Come. The gods are blessing you. Where were you? I am staying here. She made you stay, didn't she? The girl. No, Mother. My choice. (slap) I don't understand you. We have nothing to go for. And now that we've found a place, you'd rather go and chase the unknown. I am happy here. And yes, I am marrying Beda. We can start fresh here. Build a farm and go about our lives. I'm starting to feel alive. Do not take that away from me. I don't even know how old I am, or how much of my life has been wasted. Having no memory of the past is like being dead. I don't know what I like and what I don't like. I'm discovering myself, day by day. And now I like Beda. And I like this village. Maybe there's a husband here for you. I've seen how some of the men are looking at you. That's it, Mother. I need you to prepare a good wedding. Your son is getting married. We must go now. Our people are getting slaughtered. People die all the time. Not like this. It's time for me to join this fight. I will not let you die! (thud) (sobs) (sobs) Mother? Are you okay? Mother? Are you okay? Promise me that tomorrow, no matter what you hear, no matter what goes on, you will stay here in this tent. I love you, Tsicar. - I love you, too. [Hooded Man] Seven years have now passed, and today, in accordance with the book, it's the day we exact punishment. [Rouh] The child has a father. [Hooded Man] If he does not come forth and claim the child the gods will not hear the testimonies of women. [Rouh] But he wouldn't exist without a father! [Hooded Man] May the gods ease your pain. (Rouh screams) (dark music) (flames sizzle) (sinister music) Who's there? I sense your evilness. It's me. I need something to stop a man's heart while he sleeps. Here. Thank you for protecting our village. Does it have a taste? What you have there is- Yes or no? No. Just add water. Good. I was never here. (fire crackles) (background chatter) (percussive music) Congratulations. [Tsicar] Get out. Idir! Are you going to sleep all day? Idir! Mother? You did well to make him marry you, but do not let him inside you. Tonight, in his tent, you will give him this in water. He will sleep forever. This is the virgin's blood. (Beda sobs) You know what to do with it. (Beda gasps and moans) You're hurting me. The only man she will share an empty space with is her husband, Idir. [Tsicar] (chuckles) I had a gift for her. In the presence of others, not alone. Is everything well? We all have a past. Idir, he does not need to know. Be a strong woman and bury it deep. - I must tell you- - Don't. There is no need. Learn to deal with it alone. Everyone has a past to carry. You carry yours, alone. A woman's first marriage happens only once in her lifetime. There is nothing like it. Enjoy your night. If you want happiness, don't ask Idir for his past. (chimes clink) Marriage is an act of worship. The book has told us how to live as husband and wife. When a person marries, he has completed half of his duties as a citizen. You may now kiss the rock. [Beda] Kiss the rock. [Hooded Man] Husband and wife! (guests cheer) (lively music) (Beda chuckles) [Idir] Mother? What's going on? [Hooded Man] In order for the marriage consummation to be valid, witnesses must be present. Therefore, we allow you the choice. Either we stay, or your mother. [Idir] I don't understand. [Hooded Man] To avoid deception. Deception? Pick your mother. If not, they will watch until it happens. Happens? The blood. [Hooded Man] The virgin's blood. It is the seal to the marriage. They must see the blood. (Idir chuckles) What? [Beda] We want the mother. [Idir] No. Not my mother. Very well. We will all witness, and if your mother chooses to leave, she may do so. Let it begin. Give it to me as soon as it happens. And do so quickly, lest your manhood be tarnished amongst the village. Commence! I don't... It's okay. It's okay. (lively music) (moans) (moans) (hooded man sniffs) (villagers yell and cheer) (lively music) (peaceful music) That was for them. This is for us. (rhythmic sensual music) (moans) (moans) (rhythmic scraping) You should be outside celebrating. [Idir] I'm thirsty. (sighs) Me too. (sighs) I don't wanna move. Me neither. (chuckles) (sighs) I get it. I get the water. (suspenseful music) (Epoh vocalizes low-pitched tone) (tent rustles) What are you doing here? What I asked you for. The red powder. I need it. My friend. She needs it now. My child, you have no friends. (Beda sobs) My child, what is wrong? I am in trouble, Uncle. (sobs) I'm scared. He has taken your heart. Don't fight it. Let it happen. Go. Go to your husband. Do not live in fear. (fire crackles) (vocalizes low-pitched tone) (water splashes) Is it done? (tense music) (bird squawks) You let him inside you, didn't you? Tell me he's dead, at least. (chuckles) Oh. Our little mother has a big dream now, doesn't she? Well, my mother had a dream once, and look at her now. My love to her is the only reason I haven't spoken. Is it all worth this? It takes a real man to hurt me. (bird squawks) The village is expecting a newborn soon. I wonder what he's gonna do when he- It doesn't matter anymore. (wind blows) (moaning and panting) (screaming and panting) (moaning and panting) (screaming and panting) (screaming) (baby cries) Someone had a baby. (somber music) Um... The book tells us to sacrifice the oldest person in the family when a newborn baby comes to life. To sacrifice? You mean to kill? My father sacrificed his soul for me to live. Years later, my mother joined him onto the afterlife. (high-pitched ringing) (muffled chatter) It is forbidden to speak about these particular rules. It upsets the gods. And we wouldn't want that. What else should I know? Does this rule apply to foreigners? To us? You tell me this now? My mother. I'm sorry. I tried to... (gasps) It is not allowed to- No, it's only allowed to lie and deceive. I'm not carrying your child. How would you know that? I have been inside you many times. You lied to me. (somber music) (Beda sobs) I'm not carrying your child. I'm not carrying your child. I'm not carrying your child. (sobs) You both still have the prayers by memory? Why do you allow the killing of innocent people? What is the reason behind all these absurd and barbaric rules? I will allow this outburst only once and that is because- Is that the book that justifies murder? What other nonsense does it hold? Silence! Be warned. First of all, no citizen may address us in such a manner. And secondly, blasphemers are put to death, and you are dangerously close to becoming one of those. Is it blasphemy if one challenges murder? You speak from madness, foreigner. Indeed, I am a foreigner, and I will not follow your absurd rules. A challenge to us is a challenge to the gods and the book. I no longer wish you live in your village. Apostasy is punishable by death. Apostasy? How is one's love of life an apostasy? (thuds) (grunts) I will take my family and leave. Bring me Tsicar. He will grow to be a strong man, like his father. I am happy to give him my soul, and finally go meet the gods. Do not let sadness fill your heart, for I am going to a better place. (baby grunts) (mother sings in foreign language) Blessed by the hands that will send me to my gods. Be ready before dawn and may the gods be satisfied. (somber music) How far is the uncle's village? Could be a week, maybe? Why? We must leave tonight. - It is too late, son. - No, it isn't. Escaping is forbidden. People are free to live where they wish. We must obey the rules of the land we live in. The book set the rules for our people. I write my own book. Son. I've already informed them that we no longer wish to live here. You must go to them and ask for forgiveness. By tomorrow, we will no longer be here. Gather your things, Mother. (Beda grunts) (Beda groans and sobs) Tsicar? Tsicar, are you there? Tsicar, are you there? Tsicar? (urine splashes) Please help me. Please, take that outside. And bring the other one here. Yes, my lady. You're the foreigner, aren't you? Yes, my lady. My name is Idir. Forgive me for having you do such unpleasant tasks. It is an honor to help the mother of a friend. I must excuse myself. Ah, sit. Tsicar will be here any moment. He used to get uncomfortable, too. My lady? Tsicar's father. He was very shy when first we met. I... I loved that man. Then he was gone. I am sorry for the loss. He didn't die. I died. He left the village. He was a foreigner, like yourself. And that's why I am here. I came to tell Tsicar that I'm leaving tonight. If they capture you, they will kill you and your mother. And the poor Beda. She's like a daughter to me. I don't want this to happen to her. And if she's with child, then they will punish her after seven years. Seven years? The book moves the punishment for a pregnant woman until the child doesn't need a mother. If you must leave, do not tell anyone. Not even my son. [Tsicar] Idir. I must go now. (Tsicar sighs) What did you tell him, Mother? His manners remind me of your father. The elders want him punished. Do you want him punished? No foreigner should break our rules. Your father and I were in the same situation. Remember that. (somber music) (cat meows) Are you ready? Let's go. (suspenseful music) (baby cries) Shh. Going somewhere? No one breaks our rules. I just want to leave with my family. I thought we were brothers. Very well. Leave. I am giving you a chance to go. But Beda is not leaving this village. You need to make a choice, before the wise men arrive. [Kashou] My lords. I am to blame for all of this. [Hooded Man] Take them all. Tsicar! [Man] And may the gods be satisfied. [Villagers] Satisfied. May the soul transfer to the child in peace. [Villagers] Peace. [Man] And may the gods be satisfied. [Villagers] Satisfied. [Man] May the soul transfer to the child in peace. [Villagers] Peace. [Man] And may the gods be satisfied. [Villagers] Satisfied. Bring them. (tense music) Free him. You should have left. [Hooded Man] Only blood will satisfy the gods. We offer you a chance to cleanse yourself of your sins. You must sacrifice this man and by your own hand, and only then will you be forgiven. [Villagers] Satisfied. [Hooded Man] Tsicar! Give him the blade. (dark music) (knife clangs) I refuse to obey these heartless gods. How do you even know these gods exist? Have you seen a god? You, have you seen a god? If the gods did not exist, they would've told us so in the book. [Villagers] They would've told us in the book! How does something that does not exist speak to you? Least of all tell you that it does not exist! How? How can that be? Anyone? It's a lie. (groans) [Mother] My gift to the gods. (knife slashes) (blood splatters) (fire crackles) (baby cries) I'm with child! (sobs) [Hooded Man] How can that be? Your marriage was but a few days ago. How can you possibly know if you are with child? I am the one who told her, my lord. I know when a woman is with child. Her eyes, they are sunken in. The child will take that sight from her, to look inside the womb. Her nose is swollen. The child will use that to breathe. The redness in her skin. It is to keep the child warm. The boils on her forehead. At one time, my lord, I was a midwife. A good midwife. I know when a woman is with child. The gods will tell us so that we may protect the child when they're inside of us, before it's too late. Then you will be sacrificed for the child. Yes, my lord. Lock them up, until we can be sure. Why did you give the foreigner the knife? He could've killed me. [Hooded Man] Are you ready to lead? [Tsicar] My lord? [Hooded Man] Your loyalty has been rewarded and you are about to learn what the three of us have carried for years. What I am about to tell you shall not leave this tent. There are people trying to destroy our perfect world, and inhibit the words of the gods. Are you willing to serve those gods? [Tsicar] Yes, my lord. [Hooded Man] Come. Now remember, being a lord comes with great duties and secrecy. First, you must learn all of the laws and rules by heart. We will teach you every night from here on. Only the three of us must know of this. The people must see you with the book, and they must believe you can read. Also, start teaching Tyro. He seems like a good boy. You may leave. - Yes, my lord. [Hooded Man 2] Why didn't you tell him the truth? [Hooded Man] Do not tell him that we cannot read. [Hooded Man 2] And if the true book emerges? I don't think there was ever a true book, and if there was, no one would be able to read it. People will believe whatever comes out of our mouth. So it'll all just be the same? [Hooded Man] It is the same new beginning. (dark music) (Beda sobs and pants) No. (pants) (pants) (sobs) This must end, Mother. Nine moons have passed and nothing but silence. I still don't understand why you and Beda treat me that way. Women. - My lord! - One moment. I have something for you. Tyro! Tyro will be your new legs, Mother. And now that I am lord, I will make our- You have been a lord for nine months, and what've you done for the people besides build a nicer tent for yourself? (sighs) Now you want to buy my love by making this boy carry me. (sighs) If you want my love back, let Beda and her family go free. Her child doesn't deserve to be without a father. Like you. Stay here with her, Tyro, and do as she commands. Come. (wind howls) Please. May I have some water? (coughs) (somber music) No, no. No, no more, no more. No, please. Please, no more. (coughs) (coughs) (food thuds) I can't reach it. Can you help? Come back. (somber music in foreign language) (groans) This is a good rule. Some rules are good. (laughs) [Idir] Thank you. [Beda] Thank you. You shine as bright as the sun, my brother. Congratulations. Cheers, brother. [Tsicar] Enjoy your gifts. (Idir laughs) Enjoy it. [Beda] We must get moving, my love! [Idir] Where are we? [Kashou] Keep walking. [Idir] Mother, I think my mind has gone mad. [Kashou] We need to get rest. We will leave early in the morning. (crickets chirp) Eat. Well, if you're not going to eat for you, eat for my son. You haven't spoken one word to me in over eight moons. It's impressive. A woman truly knows how to hold on to her anger. I just don't understand what it is you want. All this can change if you just speak to me. (sighs) You know I'm a lord now, and I could have any woman I desire. But I choose you. Isn't that more than any woman could dream of? This tent could make a nice home. Instead of a lonely prison. (somber music) Every woman wants to only be a woman. That's something that you can't give. Not you. Not anyone in this village. My lord. Except my husband. It was better when you didn't speak. And I should just cut your tongue out. (Beda sobs) [Tsicar] It is allowed for a man to kill himself, but attempting it is forbidden. [Hooded Man 2] It is forbidden for a woman to wear the hood of lordship. [Tsicar] It is forbidden for a woman to wear the hood of lordship. [Hooded Man 2] Again. [Tsicar] A man is allowed to kill himself, but attempting it is forbidden. [Hooded Man 2] It is forbidden for a woman- [Tsicar] To wear the hood of lordship. [Hooded Man 2] A man is allowed to kill himself- [Tsicar] But attempting it is forbidden. [Hooded Man 2] It is forbidden to name your own child. Only the lords give names. [Tsicar] It is allowed for a woman- [Hooded Man 2] Again. [Tsicar] It is forbidden to name a child. Only the lords give names. [Hooded Man 2] Again, Tsicar. Naming a child- [Tsicar] Is forbidden. Only the lords give names. [Hooded Man 2] Again. [Rsicar] It is forbidden to name your own child. Only the lords can give names. A man is allowed to kill himself, but attempting it is forbidden. [Hooded Man 2] Again. (wind blows) (suspenseful music) (leaves rustle) You came back. You have my word. I will not break your nose again. Just pass me that bread. (chuckles) I'm ready. I just want to see my family, one last time, my lord. (Tsicar chuckles) Hearing you call me lord is more satisfying than touching Beda. I really wish she could see the man that she thinks is better than me. Wearing that hood will not make you a man or a leader. It only gives you certain powers like touching married women. Yes. And that is exactly what I want to do at this point in time. Come closer so I can see your eyes while we speak. What do you take me for? Stupid guard? Prepare yourself to be a good sacrifice. And as I said before, we all exist as a solution to someone else's problem. (melancholy acoustic music) (Idir screams) I am worried. Your lord said you were to obey my commands, didn't he? [Tyro] Yes, my lady. Well, I command you not to worry. (suspenseful music) Son. Wake up. Idir! Who's there? [Rouh] It's me, son. Tsicar's mother. My lady. My lady, they will punish you. I've been punished enough. There is no time. You must go now. My mother. And Beda. When you leave, there's a cave on your left. Your mother is there. Beda is in your old tent, chained. [Idir] And the baby? Days away. You must hurry. (Idir grunts) (somber music) (Idir grunts) - Idir! - Shh! Son! You're alive! (sobs) (music intensifies) Idir! (sobs) Idir. Son. Listen to me. I will take care of you. Mother, wait here. I'll be right back. (crickets chirp) (fire crackles) Idir? Is that you? [Kashou] Beda? [Beda] I knew you would come for me. (sobs) I missed you so much. So I was right after all. (distant drums thud) - That's the sound of- - Find and kill, I know. Is that blood? [Idir] Mother, put the fire out. I will go see. They haven't gone far. We will find them and when we do, I will have my way with them. Two in the front, go right. [Idir] We have to go. [Kashou] Just a little bit more. [Beda] I can't walk. - Idir, we have to stop! - We cannot stop, Mother. (muffled chatter) We have to keep moving. [Kashou] Let's go, let's go, let's go. (Beda grunts and pants) [Idir] You two wait here. [Beda] I need to push. Shh, shh, shh. (Beda grunts loudly) No, no, no. (Beda grunts loudly) No, no. Come, come, come, come! [Beda] I can't breathe. (Beda pants) [Kashou] Shh! (grunting) (Beda screams) (grunting) [Idir] GO! [Idir] Mother Go now! (Beda screams) (grunting) (Beda screams) (grunting) (baby cries) (grunting) (Idir yells) Idir! (baby cries) (bones crack) (baby cries) - Watch out, Idir! (thud) (ominous music) (baby cries) Well, isn't this nice? (slap) Give me the child. Give me the child! No. (baby cries) A girl? (baby cries) I should kill you all right now. Take her. No, no, no. No, no! (screams) (screams) They got them. (Kashou screams) If your families mean more to you than your beloved lord in this book, then I tell you now, only blood and painful punishment will ease the anger of the gods. And that woman, she will sacrifice her soul for the grandchild. (villagers cheer) [Beda] My lord! Tsicar is the father of the child. He forced me to marry the foreigner. To, to save his mother Rouh from being sacrificed. And make all of you think that Idir is the father. He then gave me this poison to kill Idir! Idir and Kashou have nothing to do with this. I! And that man, who must be punished! And punished, I shall. Tell the truth, son. Do what is right. Put me down. No one deserves this. It would be better to die. I offer myself as sacrifice for my grandchild. As you wish. Tsicar's mother must be sacrificed! And you must do it to maintain your lordship. I will do it. But only if you show everyone, everyone here, where it says in that book that I must do so. Yes! The people deserve to see what's inside the book. - We all want to see! - Show us! It will do you no good to see what's in this book, for none of you can read! The book is nothing but empty pages! [Villagers] What? (sharp thud) (villagers scream) (Tsicar grunts) (somber music) (Tsicar pants) [Tsicar] I'm sorry. (groans) (sharp thuds) (villagers scream) (repeated thuds) Rouh. Chew this. You'll go to sleep. And you'll have no more pain. I am your only lord now! These people can go free. [Beda] I don't understand. I knew who it was Tsicar was going to poison. I couldn't let that happen. (bird squawks) (wind blows) [Idir] I wish you could understand me. Maybe you do. I don't remember much. I don't know who I am. Come, Idir. We must keep walking. [Idir] All right. Where are we going? [Kashou] We're going home. [Idir] Where is home? [Kashou] Do you not remember who I am? [Idir] No. I am your wife. And this is our child. (bird squawks) (somber music) [Beda] Where is my baby? No! Idir! Where is my baby? No! Idir, Idir! No! (sobs) Where is my baby? (sobs) Idir! Oh, my baby! Oh, my baby! My baby, my baby, my baby! My baby! (screams) (screams and sobs) TSICAR! Where is my baby? (screams and sobs) [Beda] Tsicar! Where is my baby?
