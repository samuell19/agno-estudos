LOVE AND CHATTER (LET'S SAVE THE VIEW) Idiot! I'm here! Sorry. I was… speeding and I didn't see you. Shall we go there? - Wherever you want. I dreamed of you. You were on a horse. I'd like to dream of you too, but I fall asleep right away. If you don't, how can you dream of me? Don't look at me. My dad's here. Wait for me at the tubes. What an idiot! I'm afraid he saw me. - No, he was working. Come. Come on. Maria… I must tell you something. Shall we go there? See? There. Well? - I have to tell you something. Say it. Can't you guess? - I'm not an astrologist. I'd like to be your boyfriend. But you have been, for a month. - Really? Please! I already got three slaps from my dad because he's against it. Every time he sees me with you, he hits me. Wh… Why? - He hits me. He doesn't like me? - No. He says you have a car and we don't. But Dad has to pay 24 installments. We buy everything like that. If you were a rich girl, I couldn't marry you. Have you ever heard of my dad? - No. He cares for those who are very poor. Did he every hit you? - Never. Lucky you! You won't be hit anymore. I will tell him everything and… Why are you laughing? - I like it when you stutter. I don't care. We have Dad in the family who speaks well for everyone. But I really like it. - Wh… What? I like it. "Wh… what." I like it! What do you like about me? - About you? Everything. - Come on! Run! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10… 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36… Where does all that stuff go? - To Rome. My mother was there on her honeymoon. We… we'll go there too. - Yes, tomorrow. I mean when we get married. Sure… Maria, the other train is coming. - Well? I'll walk like this up to the red pole. I can go farther. Ouch! Darn it! I pierced myself. - Let me see. There's some blood too. Let me see. - You can't. Come here. - I'm sorry for my skirt. You don't want me to cure you? - Go on! - Come! But he… he wants to ruin her. Doesn't he know that a slap can make you stupid? Call Dad. - He's in a meeting, Paolo. It's urgent. - OK, it's urgent. Understand? - Yes. I'm going. Any news on my retirement? - You must be patient. How much? A lot. Paolo, what is it? - Sorry, Dad. What happened to you? - Nothing to me. - Mom? No, no, no… - Well? I've wanted to tell you something for over a month. And you come here out of breath? Dad, there's a weak person who is getting slapped. Hard slaps. I saw it. - From who? Her father. Why? I need time to explain it. - Then explain it at home. Or wait for me here. Your problem is very noble. Never slaps! Never violence! I'll say to him, "Have a good trip, Mr. Mayor". "We hope that this century's medical progress will return you in good health to your city." Oh, no! He's leaving with the fear of dying and you speak of doctors and health? You should say, "Mr. Mayor…" - Excuse me. It was my turn. Excuse me. We must make him laugh, poor mayor! "We are pleased about your vacation…" Vacation… "We envy you, Mr. Mayor." "Lucky you. You're going to Switzerland among flowers and cows!" Maybe we won't see the mayor again. In our greeting, there must be a sense of the eternal. Yes. We'll say, "Rest in peace" - May I try too? I'd say, "Dear Mr. Mayor, goodbye and see you soon", because even we, of the opposition, wait for you like impatient children. But who waits for you, counting the days, hours and minutes? The dear old people of the rest home who… - He's been repeating that for years! Yes! Since the year of the bombing, those dear old people have been there. "Twenty of them, crowded as hens in a coop…" Thirty! All in one big room. They eat, drink, sleep… everything. And so? Young people do need room, but old people? Must they run? Do I run? No. Well then! Besides, Bonelli, we're not here to do literature. As soon as you rebuild the rest home: trees, sea, countryside, all this wonderful view that leaves us breathless because one does not live on bread alone, you'll cancel and close it. - To whom? To all those who are behind it, naturally. - All! Just one. - Will you allow me to give his name? If I'm not mistaken it begins with a "P", "Pa". Paseroni! - And that's not little! - Paseroni is Paseroni. He could've chosen 1,000 other places in Italy, but he chose our Matorno. In buying the villa, Paseroni honored our town. - There! He comes here to rest and we cover his view by building a rest home? But we, of the opposition… - What "we"? You are alone. The opposition is the backbone of freedom! The mayor is leaving. - He's already in the car. He was to come here. - He was to give his assignment. Bye. Go! Go! First the assignment then the speech! He's leaving! - He's coming back! Now tell me everything. - The mayor is waiting in the car. For me? Me? - Yes, you, Bonelli. Get in. Accompany me to the station. - Yes, with infinite pleasure. During my absence, he'll be my substitute. Me? Go past the rest home. The rest home? - I had your old people gathered. They'll be happy. When will this tolling stop? - It's twelve, noon, Mayor. Do you believe in curses? - What curses? The ones your old people sent me! No, it can't be true. - It is. I've evidence, documentation. - No! They've sent me many, during the years. Don't deny it! Maybe, but they were addressed to Paseroni. No, no! Me too! Paseroni takes care of things his own way. I don't want to leave with their curses. I agree, Mr. Mayor. - I'm not bad! - No, Mr. Mayor. You're not bad. - Tell your old people so. I wish to leave with their smiles. Their congratulations. But sincere! - Certainly, Mr. Mayor. Calm down! Hello! - Don't crowd! 32 people present, Mr. Mayor. - Go! Go! Here, speak. Tell them I so much wished to say goodbye to them. Is that all, Mayor? - Lay it on thick. I leave it to you! My friends, the mayor didn't want to leave you without a warm and brotherly goodbye. The mayor says goodbye and we accompany him with our wishes, and a warm applause. Cheers for the mayor! - Cheers! Is that enough? - No. Say that the works will begin… That they'll begin! Mr. Mayor wants to tell you that finally he has decided to re-build the rest home. It was about time! - Finally they made up their mind. I can even go better. When should I say we'll begin? As soon as possible! Go on. He said the works will begin as soon as possible. "As soon as possible." "Soon!" Eh! The same story! - We must be more precise. Say as soon as possible. Within the month! - He said within the month! Tomorrow. - Tomorrow! He said tomorrow! - Bravo, Mayor! Cheers! Cheers! Best wishes! Paolo! Paolo, hurry, the Dictaphone! - Right away! Mom, the electricity socket is there. Is it working? - Yes, it's turning! Turn it this way. - Yes. This ceremony is not a ceremony. Stop with words. The time has come for action which unites us all like this. Emotions that make us all brothers… like this! Bravo, Bonelli! Very good! - My compliments! Well? - I almost told him everything. I'll tell the rest today. See? Everyone is embracing Dad. - Yes. Everyone is embracing. Embrace me! Yes… Your father! Stop, Borghi! I don't want to see the first cement slab. I want to see the last one! - You never believe anything. Know how much Mr. Paseroni earns a day? 10 million! - Lucky him! He can buy the mayor, my friend, the councilor and all of Town Hall. But my father… not my father! My father won't… let anyone buy him. Cheers, then! Cheers! Bravo! I'll read you a telegram that has just arrived. "Deputy mayor Bonelli. Matorno." Impossible to reach in time your ceremony" "for enlarging construction, my dear neighbors. Inauguration wishes." "Signed Paseroni." Words cost so little! No more words! - Bravo! - Right! Speech! Speech! - No! Yes! - Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! A nice speech! What differentiates a civil population from an uncivil one? Respect for the aged! When an old man entered the stadium of Sparta everyone stood up. "What differentiates a civil population from an uncivil one?" "Respect for the aged!" What is it? - A Dictaphone. 36 installments, but this is your future. "When an old man entered the stadium of Sparta…" - Louder. "…to give him a seat." "Citizens, even today, we'll all stand up together," "as a sign of filial reparation." Listen, Dad… - Vittorio, I think the invitation is nice. "My dear neighbors, I send an inaugural greeting." "We'll be waiting tomorrow, dear family, a cup of tea at our home." "Cordially. Paseroni." He's nice but wants to corrupt me. - Right. You'll tell him, "Corrupt me if you can." You will be appreciated by an important person. Clara, our maid is more important, on a human level. Right! Even a streetcleaner, eh? - Certainly. May I finish what I was saying yesterday about slapping? Slapping? - Yes. - Oh, the slaps! Right! - Listen… Look at that! Look! Look! Look! What a bully! Idiot! - Arrogant! The railway crossing stopped him. - Serves him right! Good for you, Dad! Railway crossings are the most serious thing in our country! They stop everyone without any class distinction. Here he comes! - I see him. It's coming. - Yeah, honk! Honk! What sort of behavior is this? May I? Attorney Bonelli. Dodi, where are you going? - There. I was normally passing a car and asked for a clear coast to that American car that he stayed in the middle, in a despotic way… so I insisted. Get back in the car. - Why? - Don't get mixed up with those people. He didn't move… - Dad, he called us, "those people". You hear that? "Those people!" That man has shown us his morals. He didn't only offend me but all of you who sweat for your daily bread! You like to blather a lot, eh? - Penguin! That's what you are. A penguin! Fine but watch your language. - Officer, no more of this meritocracy! "This first slab of cement should sound as a ring of victory!" "Before us, we have a difficult job," "one as difficult as emptying a sea with a teaspoon." "But one must hold the spoon firmly and have faith." Paolo, now tell me… - Dad! - Clara, I can't. I won't go to Paseroni's! Vittorio, they even sent flowers. - You want me to go? I'll go in and right out. I'll have tea standing. "A pleasure". Excuse me… - No, not "A pleasure". A curt bow and then away! - Bravo, Dad! You're always on Dad's side! Let's not think about it anymore. What did you want to tell me? Do you have time? - Certainly. I'll start from the beginning. - Alright. The first time was over a month ago, more than a year ago. Or I'll bring this and then pull it out. I'll say, "Don't worry, Paseroni, I left the bullets home." "I wanted to read to you these words my father dictated." "Per aspera ad astra. It's Latin. You won't understand so I'll translate." "Either one is, or one is not." Continue, Paolo. From the beginning? - Yes. It was raining. I was pedaling very fast on my bike. Pedaling very fast. I rode over a puddle and splashed water on the sidewalk. A girl cried out, "Idiot"! Who's an idiot, Paolo? - Me, Dad. Why? - Because… Excuse me, Dad. May I? - First turn on the recording! Here. Mr. Paseroni! Mr. Paseroni… Maria! - Why don't you answer? I can't go up and down 10 times. - Dammit, I was about to tell him! How should I know? Then why did you come? - You ring so loudly. Everyone will hear. If the others can't hear, you can't hear either. - I hear fine. I always hear. - Certainly! Bye. I came because I have two free hours. We can speak in peace. I'll finish and come. Where? - Hurry. I'll wait in the woods. "Mr. Paseroni!" "Before us, opens the era of the humble. The humble are the salt of the earth." What you think of it? - The humble are the salt of the earth. With your words, you can get anything you want. Naturally for the old people, the rest home. Go there, speak and make him cry. - But Clara… - You'll make him cry! You made the Carabinieri cry. - Mom! Dad… - That's a good one. Shall we make him cry, Paolo? - Who, Dad? Paseroni. Shall we make him cry? Oh, yes! - How shall we dress? Cleanly is good enough. - Yes. Paolo, go change. - Me too? - Certainly. Get your hands out of your pockets and go to Dad's other side. - In the middle. Even white gloves! - Clara… The Bonellis are here. Here they are. Mr. Mayor! Please, I'm the Deputy Mayor. - Whatever! As you wish. Now that Salviati's poor star is there, hanging by a thread. My wife. - Mine. A pleasure. No crossed hands! It brings bad luck. It brings bad luck. No! No crossing. No crossing. - A pleasure. Not yet… - A pleasure. Sit down on the sofa. - Thank you, Ma'am. It's leopard… - Sit down, Mr. Mayor. My name is Dodi, and yours? - Paolo. Thank you! They were two lovely hours! Really lovely! He'll hear me now. Penguin! The animal that reminds us of coat-tails. That's a good one! It's not true, but good. Wait. I paid that fine with pleasure. You spoke and were a spectacle. I'm not good at speaking. But with a phone call, I can have someone nominated a "commendatore" in a day. What are you? - Nothing? - You don't care? How strange. Too bad! Shall we take a walk while they serve tea? I can have a minister fall but I can't be a minister because I can't speak. While you… - I'm just sincere. You'll never hear him acknowledge it. - Let us hear something, just between us. Oh, yes, he improvises. - Really? When we were engaged, I would say "sky" and he'd make a speech on the sky. Even if I said "glass". - Clara! - Why not? - Even "glass"! He could say beautiful things about a glass. Madam, between you and me… I heard him talk and… And Paolo was born. Bravo! Have you ever seen the view from my terrace? Come. Make way for young people! Has anyone ever heard of "make way for old people"? Never! Nor "narrow the way for old people!" Nor "make way". - Nor "narrow". - Nor "make way". Substantially, we agree. Come. Let's go see the… What is my husband asking for? Some sky! He has a right to it, no? He seems to be big, but inside he's slender. Giannina! Offer it to the lady. He's slender but also strong. Paseroni breaks his enemies. With him you're for or against him! He wanted me, against all of Milan, and now I am his. I was lower class, I'm not ashamed to say it. He pulled me out of it. - Very noble! I have a kilo and a half of diamonds, I change one fur coat a day, and when I stroll in Milan, everyone looks at me. Sorry, if I say this nonsense, but I suffered so much, and now the others suffer! Lovely, huh? Lovely. - Very lovely. Beautiful. But when an old man entered the stadium in Sparta… Excuse me… excuse me! Nothing. I just got emotional. A little vegetation, a tree, and for me it's enough… I get emotional. You like ham hocks? - Ham hocks? Poor Mayor Salviati lit up whenever he saw ham hocks! For solemn occasions, I always sent him cases, with our best production: butter, cheese, sauces, canned goods… He appreciated everything, but ham hocks. Quite a character. I saw him cry once in front of a ham hock. Salviati is a sensitive man. Now if you say "old people", I… Look. I get goose bumps. In fact, I was saying, "When an old man entered the stadium in Sparta…" Can we sit there? - Surely. - Thank you. I've an idea. When you speak, you open up horizons. Don't exaggerate. I'm not. I was an idiot not to think of it before. Keep straight. - Paolo! It's something modern. Come see. It's not right that an orator like you… If only I could use words as you do! It's not right that you end up here. Rome needs men like you. Rome is a step that reaches the top. You want to give it up? You've no right. For your family, for the country! You're the man I need for Sunday. I'm inaugurating the villa on Sunday. I invited Moriconi. Moriconi… Moriconi? Yes, Tonino, the minister. He's in love with Nature. Gervasi will come too. - Gervasi… Gervasi? Yes, Limasoni, Paratone, Ercolai… The heart of the nation! - Almost all of it. I need a speech, a great speech. A speech? On what? A speech! On the view. We can talk about the beauties of Matorno, of Italy. For Italy, the view is everything. It is the wealth of the country. - We cash in high currency. We need the views. They are the bread of the spirit. - You get it? Moriconi and companions come, and what do they see there? A wall. Moriconi is Neapolitan and says to me, "Who do you want to kid?" Can't we suspend until after his speech on the radio? The radio? Yes. The radio will be there. Can't we suspend… Mr. Paseroni, I don't think… I don't think it's possible. - Think about it. In fact, let's think about it right away. Think. - How can we? We can. - But how? We can, we can! If my dad wants, he can even buy Town Hall. A Town Hall can't be bought. My dad can. Know what that means? If you don't, get educated. Educate yourself, if you don't know who my dad is. I know the big fish always eats the small one. Maria, shall we go to the meadow? - I don't know you. Wh… What? - I don't know you! What's with you? - Go away! I don't have a villa. What've I got to do with it? Let me explain. OK, explain, so it'll be over. What's the rush? - Well? The explanation? I don't care about a villa. You really think I care? Why am I to blame? They took me there. I'm not an adult. Am I an adult? To be able to see you, I… Slapped again? - Twice! Doesn't your dad know you can become stupid with a slap? In fact, I'm stupid to go out with you. I know there's a girl there. Who? - The daughter. That one! Oh, that one! Paolo, the ball! - Paolo, kick the ball back! Come on! Kick! Maria… Maria! Go ahead and play soccer. Play! My dad is right. Goodbye. Yeah. "I'll talk to Dad. I'll talk to Dad!" Good night, dear. - Good night, Paolo. When Mrs. Paseroni saw him with Dodi, she said, "A lovely couple!" Dad, I'm in love with Maria Furlani, the street sweeper's daughter. What did you say? In love! The street sweeper's daughter? - Yes. The street sweeper's daughter! Your father is struggling to get ahead and you… Dad, Mom doesn't understand these things. You explain. What is there to understand? - Dad will explain. Vittorio, a street sweeper's daughter! Clara, a street sweeper and a king are the same thing today. A coat of arms can have a broom inside it, as once there was a sword or a spear. You surely remember the apologue by Agrippa Menenius. The hands, the stomach, the head, all participate towards a final end. Son, did you have to pick a street sweeper's daughter? But Dad… - Clara, that's not it. Paolo, all human creatures are on the same level. But you're just 15. - So many years of study ahead. Seven years plus two of training make nine. Be reasonable. Her father slaps her. - Good for him! Good night. You were too impulsive. - But so is he. Suddenly in love, without telling anyone! A street sweeper's daughter! You said it too, Vittorio. Just now that… something extraordinary is happening in our life. I feel it. Like when we dream of lottery numbers. I really dreamed it. Friday night. You were in front of many microphones all made of gold! There was a black man listening to you, a Chinese, one of those with all those furs on… An Eskimo. - Yes! And then… And there was Dad with his lovely Colonel uniform. He peeked out of the clouds and said, "Clara, I apologize for not having believed in your Vittorio." Please. - Here? - Yes. Clara, do you think I have the necessary qualities to really become someone in this country? In the world! What does the Prime Minister have more than you? Oh, yes. Excuse me. If he only had your speech, your voice, your smile! Go on. And your way of speaking, so dear, so simple… You touch your tie and handkerchief and send forth treasures. A view… Darn it! A beautiful image came to my mind. A view as heritage of… It's gone! How can I tell those poor old people, "Stop", "Soon", "In a short while"? A long distance call! - Your slippers! Yes, it's long distance. Yes? Hello? Yes, Mr. Bonelli. "Hello? Hello?" Switzerland! During the operation? The operation? Oh, the operation! The mayor. No! Oh, what a loss! What a great loss, Ma'am! This city, in every corner, in every person, will carry… and will always carry the stamp of his human work. An irreplaceable man! Yes, Ma'am, irreplaceable! Irreplaceable because, as I was saying, this city, in every corner, in every person, will carry forever the stamp of his work. The stamp of his work, of his human work. Who did not receive a word from him, an act, a gesture… Mrs. Bonelli. Come in the car. No, why? - You want to get wet? Thank you. - You come too. Irreplaceable! From valley to valley, from mountain to mountain, this word must echo out while he leaves us forever. It must echo out in all its desperate sincerity. Irreplaceable! And now… And now listen… Listen, Giovanni, to the cry that rises from my heart… Who's Giovanni? - The dead man. He's talking to him. Giovanni, let your town dedicate a new rest home to you. A modern, big one, worthy of your name! The Giovanni Salviati Rest Home. And for this reason, the works of the old one should stop, just as your life stopped. Giovanni, accept this modest tribute to your memory as a sign of mourning. A memorable speech. - I got bronchitis! People will talk about it even after you are gone. The dead man was there, alive. Mr. Ripandelli, speakers should wear a woolen t-shirt. With these fumes, I already seem to be in hell! In hell? Paradise! You are the typical person who goes to Paradise. In one hundred years, of course. Fever? - I didn't use a thermometer. That's bad. In these cases… Vittorio is a very healthy man. For that matter, often the toughest are the first to go. Poor mayor. Three months ago he was laughing. Yes, he was laughing! He was laughing… I'll rush to Town Hall where everything is going well. Wait. I'll show you out. - No, thanks. Don't bother. Oh, right! This morning the rest home works were suspended. And so? - Very well! Well understood. Someone asked when they'll resume. - What did you say? Pain doesn't have an expiration date. Very good. - Stay low. There were some reactions, but… nonsense. You just take care of yourself. My respects. Remove this stuff! - Take it away. What reaction? - It's all taken care of. Taken care of? What? Some impulsive words… - What words? What words? A curse? My respects. Vittorio… Vittorio! Please! - Yes, alright. Go. I'll get the thermometer. - Yes. Clara, do you believe in curses? If you believe in them, dear. Why? - Nothing… Go on. Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! - What is it? Call Town Hall. The rest home works must resume tomorrow. No, today! In fact, right away. Right away. No… - Yes. But… - Go on! Go, go! Paolo. Paolo! Paolo, come here. - Town Hall's number. 1227. Paolo, my son! You see? We're like falling stars. We cross the sky like a flashing light, and then… nothing. That is why your dad wants to tell you something as if writing it in a will. One must always listen to your heart. Vittorio, they say we can't today, we must wait until tomorrow. I am the mayor, insist! Ask for Cardinazzi! He insists, saying he's the mayor and to call Cardinazzi. Call him! Oh, it's you! Sorry. When we are to do something that is a good and right, we must not lose a minute. Go on, right away! Yes, Dad. Street sweeper? That's a big deal! Alright, even sewer workers are fine, as long as there's love. Health and love. - I'll keep your words here. You're… you're a great man, Dad! They said they'll send the bricklayers. Ma… Maria! Maria, I'm going to talk to your father. Good morning. - Good morning. I must tell you, I have serious intentions. Maria must not get slapped because of me anymore. Right. Then leave her alone. - Why? Young man, you worry about studying. Your father is up there and I'm down here, with a broom. He said that even a street cleaner is a big deal, it'd be an honor for him. Who said that? - My father. He said… Back off. You'll breathe bad dust here. Tell your dad to buy us one of the new, modern vans. Understand? - I understand. What if my dad comes to you officially? To do what? - Officially! Oh, Lord! I wouldn't believe it if I saw it! Anyway, I'll wait for the mayor at my house. - Really? Right away, Mr. Furlani. - Look at him. Hi, Paolo! - Hello! You're working, huh? Good morning! Good morning, Mr. Borghi. Did you see? Good morning. I hope it lasts! - Yes. You'll see! You are just afraid. Get up! Just sweat a lot and tomorrow you'll be fine. As of this month, you'll get a raise. - Thank you. Are you sincere? Accompany the doctor. Nothing is wrong with him, you were right. Give him milk and cognac. Alright. - More cognac than milk. Alright. - No, just cognac! Thank you. Vittorio! Know who was on the phone? - I'm happy for you, for my son. I work and struggle for you. - You know who was on the phone? All I need is a piece of bread, a little tree and some shade. You know who was on the phone? - Who? Mrs. Paseroni. She invited Paolo again. She asked how you were, greetings, best wishes and then added, "My husband said his mayor friend will be pleased to know" "that his Sunday speech will be… tele-transmitted." Television! - Come on, dear… Yes, go ahead and cry. Cry! You're barefoot. I'll make you some warm milk immediately. With a lot of cognac! - Yes, alright. I'll call Town Hall. - 1227. Clara! What will you tell him? To stop. It was only a misunderstanding… I'll take care of it. Mr. Minister, on this sunny day… Mr. Minister, on this sunny day… Dad! I told Mr. Furlani everything. - Yes, dear. I'm very happy. - My son! What a marvelous sensation! Being able to get up for a sick man is like shore to a castaway. Tell me, tell me. Tell me! I told him you will go talk to him. I'd love to! - If you want, he can come to you. Who should I go to? - Mr. Furlani. Who's he? - Maria's father. We'll marry after high school. If you want. - Yes, yes. Maybe even later. - Yes, yes, yes! Paolo, look at me. This is the face of a sincere friend. I was young too, and understand everything. But you know what is left of these clouds? Reality. And you know what reality is? Naturally, a street sweeper wishes to reach a mayor's level, but a mayor does not want to stoop to a street sweeper's level! Warm milk. - Man must go forward. Forward! And not backwards, backwards… Paolo, I feel you understand. We won't talk about it again. Now go to Dodi Paseroni. They're waiting for you at the villa. I'm not going. - What did you say? I'm not going. - You are going. Cardinazzi, mayor's orders: Suspend the rest home works. I see now she was right. - Who? Dodi. The big fish eats the small fish. I am not a fish! I won't allow you to judge your father! But you… You speak in one way and behave in another. He is the mayor, isn't he? What are you doing? - Leaving. What? - I'm leaving. Hide! What is it? I'm leaving. - Where are you going? Away forever. Or until I become an adult. Why? I argued with my father. Mine said you talked to him and gave him a good impression. Instead, my dad took everything back. Darn it! Things were looking good. Where are you going? - I don't know. Maybe to Rome. We wanted to go together. We will. I'll work, earn money, come back, and marry you. And he, as mayor, will have to marry us. In fact, I'll only marry in a church just to spite him. Then we'll go under his windows with trumpets. When? If you love me, five years will go by quickly. With the amnesty, they'll be less. - What amnesty? Right, it has nothing to do with it. They'll go by quickly. Here. I brought it as a souvenir. - A photograph. Do you have one? - Yes, but I'm with my parents. Can't you cut it? You look good in a bathing suit. - It was last year in Riccione. Can you cut it? Yes, but my dad's arm remains. He's holding me like this. It doesn't matter! Then I'll send it to you. What about the address? - Write it for me. Sign "Carolina". We have a cousin with that name in Genoa. Then I must go to Genoa instead of Rome. Do as you wish. I was scared. Then we'll write. - Letters from me? You won't get letters from me. Why not? - I don't know how. Just say what you feel. I tried, but something else comes out. You must write to me. One page. Half. Will you write to me? - A postcard. Thank you. - You're welcome. So… So… Goodbye. - Bye. Just bye? I wouldn't give you the satisfaction of saying goodbye. You wouldn't? - No. Mr. Mayor! - Alright. Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. - One moment, Borghi! Didn't progress invent the escalator? Why not use it? In the new rest home, there will be an escalator! Here come your objections! - No. I just wanted… The elevator! Alright, we'll put an elevator. No, the works must start! - Certainly! We must find a high place, with fresh air, and light. Right! - We are looking. Let's not rush. A hasty cat gives birth to blind kittens! We'll have lots of kittens with open eyes and pink faces! I love cats, animals. Who doesn't, does not love men. Do you love animals? - They are so dear. We agree on the fundamental things. Goodbye. Furlani, I'll be right there. Goodbye, dears. I'm always here! And we're always over there, Mr. Mayor. We're always over there, but… Meanwhile, what should we do? You'll never be without sun and affection. But Mayor, in the meantime… Don't you have checkers or chess games? No, we don't have anything. - I'll take care of that. Thank you. - Goodbye. Here I am, Furlani. Well? What can you tell me about my retirement? Dear Furlani, sit down. What is it, Furlani? Didn't you ask me to come? Yes, I did. How's the Urban Waste doing? We sweep. There's always a lot to sweep. Right. In daily life, you are a… backbone! You have any request? Maybe your son mentioned the van that closes by itself. I told him because of the dust, the flies… I hate flies. Your proposal won't be ignored. Thank you. I want to talk to you about the kids too. Even fleas cough! Have you ever heard that saying? Fleas are this small, and a cough is this big! We can only laugh at it. As you laugh, and I laugh. My son still has 3 years of study, 2 of practice, 2 of training abroad and then his military service. That'll be 1970, when the first rocket reaches the moon! And what does your daughter do? I wanted to send her to Genoa. - To study? Mayor! To be a maid. Domestic help! That's something different. If I had a daughter, I wouldn't have her be a maid, but I would let her be a domestic. - I see. Us too, since they call us "garbage men", that must be "something different." Genoa is a lovely, healthy city. The Genoese are meticulous, solid. They stay in their places. I suggest it because an accountant, is an accountant there, a cobbler is a cobbler, a porter is a porter. It's a city where each person stays in his place! Each person stays in his place, if he doesn't want to lose his job. The big fish ate the little fish. Yes, he ate it. - Stop it! You're not a good sport. You don't know how to lose. Where are the microphones? - In the center. Your husband should think about that piece of wall that remains there. It ruins the rest home. Yes, I'll tell him. How many microphones are there? Many. - Where is the orchestra? Where is the orchestra? Where is it? Out with the orchestra! It seemed like the music came out of there! Nice! An idea that is worth millions. Don't let the revenue service hear you. Sonia, don't ever say "revenue service" so unexpectedly. My love, I'm sorry. Between him and the revenue service, there's war! You want some cognac? - No, I feel better. You know what I'd do against this revenue service? One nice day, everyone tiptoes out of the country! So one day the President wakes up and doesn't find anyone. Everyone abroad! Idiot! - Paolo! There! - He broke a plate. It's just a plate. - Paolo! They're kids. - Is he leaving? Dodi! I got sick of it. That idiot made me pose for two hours. You gave her satisfaction. - She played around with me. What did you do to her? - I called her an idiot. How nice! Maria! What are you doing? - I like it. Does it still hurt? - Yes. Last night when he saw I was coming… Another slap. - If only! Two? - Now he gives me two at a time. I'm getting ready for tonight. Your dad had him go there. Why? - He wants to ruin everything. He wants you to marry her. - He can forget it. Clown! You always get cheated. "What differentiates a civil population from an uncivil one?" "Respect for old people." "When an old man entered the stadium of Sparta" "all the people rose to give him their place." Clown! And you believed it. A little talk is enough to make you soft like gelatine. We must build the rest home ourselves. We must work as a protest. I was hoping for an escalator to go up and down all day. Borghi is right. Let's do a reverse strike. Tomorrow morning at dawn. Will they put us in prison? - We'll be more comfortable. Young man, did they send you to be a spy? Tell your dad that with his chatter… He doesn't fool us! - Right, he doesn't fool us. Also tell him that Ernesto Borghi called him a "clown". I won't allow it! - What won't you allow? My father does what he says and you aren't worthy to say his name! Not even say his name! - I won't allow you! I won't allow you! I won't allow you… What's he have to do with it? You accuse him, but… Come. - Yes. What's he have to do with it? Only a few words, Mr. Minister. A few improvised words, just as they come out my mouth and my heart at this moment. Locking yourself inside? You won't fix things up like that! Why did you say "stupid" to that dear girl? "Idiot"… "Idiot"! Worse! "Idiot"! What you did is horrible. But you can make amends. Call Dodi and apologize now. Dad thinks you already did it. Open. It's dinner time. There are cutlets, dear. Paolo, open. A phone call and then we'll go to dinner. Clara, did Paolo go to the Paseronis to do his duty? No. He's in his room. He'll call. He must hurry so he won't disturb them during dinner. Understand, Paolo? Paolo, did you hear? Open! Paolo, I'll give you one minute to open. One minute! Go! Sir, dinner is ready. Sir, dinner is ready. - Vittorio, dinner is ready! Just a moment! Paolo, just take the phone and simply say, "Hello?" Nothing more. "Hello?" You'll say, "Hello?" You must not say, "Mr. Paseroni, forgive me!" One must always have dignity. You will say, "Mr. Paseroni, I apologize to you and your daughter." That's it. Not one syllable more. It's a matter of good manners, of being civil. It is nice to acknowledge one's mistakes. Alright. I'll acknowledge them with the Paseronis, and you, with the old people of the rest home. What should I acknowledge? - You don't keep your promises. Did you hear him? He'll apologize to the Paseronis, if I apologize to the old people! Please, go. He'd like to give me a lesson on dignity. I've always lived in dignity, like meat in broth! Nice! - Like meat in broth. You are not my son. You were not born from us! Not me, at least! You were born through parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis! There's an abyss between us and the new generations! We are still idealists and you are skeptical and cynical! You don't believe in caring, pure affection, sacred bonds anymore! Paolo! Come downstairs. I just hope the night brings him good advice. You still have one night to be repentant, Paolo. Me apologize? - Your voice! To who? To the old people? OK. And to who else? To you? Come on, give me the list. I am waiting for the list! Who must your father apologize to? To all the citizens? To all Italians? Yes! We'll apologize to all Italians with a big poster! "Italians! I, Vittorio Bonelli, son of Antonio," "born in Matorno…" Can you read it? "Maria Furlani, c/o the Torri family, Piazza Ferrari 32, Genoa." It's where you must write to me and where they are sending me. To Genoa? - Yes. With the bus tomorrow morning. When are you coming back? I don't know. He's sending me to be a maid. - What? Your father scared him. I have to run right away. Write to me. Bye. - No, don't say bye! This time my dad won't see me again. I'm coming to Genoa with you. How will you eat? - I eat little. I'll get by. And the Carabinieri? They always agree with parents. They don't know me in Genoa. How will they find us? They will. - Then rebel. Say you don't want to go to Genoa. If I speak, then goodbye to me! And I must not see you again? You're not saying anything? - I'm really in love! Not like a kid. - Seriously? Sure! Am I obliged to be? You're not making me, are you? Maybe I don't know how to tell you. - Yes, darn! Since we've met we've exchanged 1,000 words at the most. Yet, I'd like to talk one full day. Disgusting world! Who are you talking to? - The world. You think it hears you? I don't think we'll ever meet again. Then it's best to die! My father would deserve it. I'm his only child. Let him give a speech on that. There are four of us. - He'll be sorry anyway. You want that? - Yes. Soon another one will go by. It's coming. Be brave! I like this bicycle a lot. - I'm just sorry about Rome. Goodbye, honeymoon! Wait! Let me do some accounting. 3 plus 3 is 6. Then 1, 2, maybe 3… We can do it! "Rome, that was to be the place for our honeymoon…" "Will, instead, be our grave." "We forgive you. Paolo and Maria." I wouldn't forgive them. - Yes. Why not? One, two, and three. One, two, and three. Call the mayor's house right now! These senile old people! Hello? Is Bonelli home? Let me talk to the mayor. Wake him up. Wake him up! What's going on? What are you doing? Today is Sunday and we don't work! The city spends money for you to have a peaceful old age, a deserved leisure. And you're working? Enough! This is a rest home, not a work home! Those who rest have a right to live here, not those who work. They don't want the new rest home to be built. And yet it will rise, against any shady dealing! Big, tall, in the sunlight! I don't know why this is happening. But I am here to help you. - Thank you! Come on! Demolish. In this case, it means build. Come on! Come on! Who wrote that? - I did. Great guy! - You're great, huh? Yes, I am! The only great thing about you is your son. What's my son have to do with this? Ma'am, try to understand. One morning a mother gets up, goes to wake up her daughter, and doesn't find her. She's disappeared! - I understand. But why get so upset right away? We've been running for an hour. We've tried everything. Ask if he knows anything. OK? - OK, but don't be so agitated. In these cases, the best thing is to be calm. Paolo! Paolo! What'll we tell the mayor? Are you tired? - No. You want to sleep a bit? They'll have noticed at home by this time. Why are you crying? Don't cry. If you changed your mind, tell me. I'll do what you want. No. - But you must not cry. Mom doesn't deserve it. Poor thing. I like your mother too. Are you cold? - No. I can see you're cold. - No. I swear, I'm not. Sandwiches, beer, mineral water… Sandwiches with what? - Ham and coppa. Two sandwiches and mineral water. How much? 300. Me too! Two. But… - You didn't eat last night. Neither did you. Eat. - Sandwiches, beer, mineral water. Go on. - With all this worry… Boys, there's room here! - Captain, there's room. Is it vacant? Excuse me, ma'am. Good morning. - Excuse me, madam. Come. There's room. - Coppa or ham? Coppa. - A beer too. Oh! What a fall! - It was very delicate! If the field is dry, it'll be quite a game! May I offer you some? - No, thanks. "Welcome to Matorno, Mr. Minister," "during this celebration of friendship where…" Damn, I say "Mr. Minister", but what if he prefers "Excellency"? Shall I say, "Excellency"? What's wrong? - Nothing. Paolo! Did he apologize? - Yes… Yes, dear. Here. - What is it? Paolo! Calm down, please. - I am calm. I can talk to Paolo, not as a son, but as a brother. Vittorio, maybe we could leave him here to punish him. No. He would come out a winner. You know who turned him against his father? An old man. Vittorio! You're in your underwear! - I know. What do they want? Why are you here? Where is Paolo? - He ran away with their daughter. Ran away? - Yes. Scoundrel! He wants to ruin me. My pants! Ran away! I see. Bound to have happened. Bound to have happened! I'd like to know who put that in his head. Who put it in his head? Who? You know nothing, right? - Don't look at me like that. My jacket! Listen… Excuse me, Ma'am. I'll call my companions. They'll help look for them. No, we must not make a commotion! It'd be a scandal! I am the mayor, don't forget it. I know, it was the old man. It's always him. Go to the rest home. You know Borghi? Tell him I could have the Carabinieri get him, and instead I am sending you in my name. We are two fathers who are moving, who are humiliated. He must tell you where the kids are. He knows! This is his plan against… Against… I know what. He must talk, or the Carabinieri will go. Clara, what should I do? - Go, Vittorio. I must go! My heart is with you, but I must go. Your hat! - Calm down, please! Let's not create a scandal. - Alright. Vittorio… What did we say: "Mr. Minister", "Excellency", "Honorable"? Right… - Legally it's "honorable". Don't worry. I'll take care of it. Today Fiorentina will score 3 goals. - Even 4. Vigili is playing. He isn't on the national team. - They choose who they like. We needed Sarti at the goal post today. Yes, we did. He doesn't let one ball go by! Sarti is playing. They announced it on the radio. Really? - Did you hear it? Yes. - Good! I like Sarti very much. - He's great. He has class. - Yes! He hasn't lost a game. - It'll be quite a game! We'll win the championship. - With this formation… Come. We're going to the stadium. - We must go to my aunt's. But it'll be a great game! - Come, miss! Maria, is it true we can't? - Come on. Get in. But we… - Give me a hand. We'll do a tour first. - Did you see how much water? We'll go past Saint Peter's, right? - Look at the Corazzieri! Lovely! - The children are having fun. They've never seen anything. - Enjoy. You're taking them for the game? - And for after the game! No, no… We can't. - We had decided! No. We must go to my aunt's. - You'll go later. Aunts promise, but they never leave money! This is the Centomila stadium. Let's get out. - Stop! Is… is she paying? - Sure. Get off, Miss. - The change, a tip. Shall we sit in the bleachers? - No, too many people. Miss, does the sun bother you? - The two of us can't. No, we can't. We must go to my aunt's. Stop with that aunt! - Thanks, but we can't. Well, good luck. - Goodbye. You're losing a great game. - Thanks, but we can't. Bye. Cheers for Fiorentina! We are talking from the Villa Paseroni terrace, on this beautiful day, full of air, lights, sounds, facing a valley that Italians can be proud of. The cameras will now present the noble crowd of people attending. Why this crowd of people? Please, please! We'll now give the microphone to Minister Moriconi, who's always present whenever the country is being promoted, a country of saints, heroes, panorama. Allow me to express my heartfelt participation in this celebration that we can call "celebration of the eyes" which from this superb villa can enjoy the view to the sea. We say it with one word… no, three. Long live Italy! - Bravo! After this applause, we will listen to our guest, Mr. Paseroni, whose daily life is alternated with work and poetry. Thank you. What can I say? God, homeland, family, and also some art. Certainly. And now, the official speaker, Matorno's first citizen, Tonelli. No, Bonelli. - My mistake, Bonelli. Be brief. - Yes. Applause! Only a few words, Mr. Minister. A few improvised words! Just as they come out of my mouth and heart. Welcome to Matorno, Mr. Minister. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this celebration of friendship where the view takes on its national value. This was the dominant idea of my predecessor, to whose memory I ask you to dedicate one minute of silence. What predecessor? - The one who died. Watch out. Read this. They ran away to Rome. - And they took a gun. The camera. - Be quiet, Dodi. It's not true! - We must hurry! And my wife? - She fainted. Do something. The radio is there! - Television! Call them! Stop them, please! Paolo, don't do anything foolish, for the love of God! Marry Maria, but don't do anything foolish. Paolo, come back among us. - He's talking to the deceased mayor. I won't talk anymore. I will be silent for a month. Forever! And I apologize to the old people. Paolo! Mom! - Who's he? A man from the rest home. - What's he doing here? He brings support to the old people. He tricked them too. Honorable Moriconi, is it true that you are here for the reconstruction of the bombed rest home? Certainly. We must rebuild it. Come on. - Tonino! The cameras. Smile! We'll rebuild! Rebuilding! Did you hear the minister? - Maria! Paolo, the minister… - Maria, it's Dad! The minister… - Maria! Attention! Attention! We're giving the formation of the teams. Fiorentina: Sarti, Magnini, Cervato, Chiappella, Rosetta, Segato, Julinho, Gratton, Virgili, Montuori, Prini. Roma: Panetti, Cardarelli, Losi, Giuliano, Stucchi, Venturi, Ghiggia, Pestrin, Nordhal, Da Costa, Lojodice. Go, if you want. I'll wait. - I don't want to go. I can see you would like to. It's an important game. Should I close my ears? No. If you go, I'm happy. We can go together. It'll all be over in an hour. Would you like that? - Yes, I would. What about the money? - Give your watch. It's not worth anything. Then… the thing. - The thing? Yes. - The suitcase? No… the thing. Right! And then? 3 to 0. - Want to bet 1,000 Lira? No. Who loses goes to Piazza Colonna in his underpants. I accept. - Alright. Sell it… and then? And then what? You like it, so we'll go. If I could go back, I'd have fun from morning to evening. I'd always travel. There are so many things to see. The more I think of it, the more my dad deserves it. But we don't. I won't go back home, even with the Carabinieri. I'm not… I'm not a clown. What I say, I do. Then I'm a clown? - No. Yes. You said it on the train. You think I'll change my mind? I won't! Go on. I'll show you. I'm not afraid. Please! Come on! Come on! Maria, I didn't mean to offend you. Maria, please! Look at me. You're right. Everything would be as it was. As it was… And we won't meet again. Then why are we thinking about it so much? Come on! What? Better to do it right away. I love you so much, and only I want to die. Come on! Kids! Kids, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Everyone's here. - So is my mother. So, we've agreed. United! - United. Dad! Dad! - Mom is below. Dad, this is Maria. My pleasure. I… - Maria! Dad! - Maria! Are you the parents? - Yes. I'm the boy's father. You must sign. Mom. - Mom! Maria, I'm Paolo's mother. - Vittorio Bonelli, here. Dear friends, on this sunny day, I feel the need to tell you a few words… A few improvised words that come from my heart. You promised! I just wanted to say a few improvised words. The train is leaving. I couldn't get out that way. The train is moving. Dear friends, on this sunny day, I feel a great beating in this luminous air, to the rhythm of this friendly train. It is the heart of the fathers of the whole world beating, beating!
