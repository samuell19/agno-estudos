Helen, Vanessa goes first! Sit down ! Vanessa goes first. No, me! Clara, Yacine. . . Cedric, then you, get ready! CLARA'S SUMMER Then who is it? Guess. He thinks you're cute. Fred. No, it's not Fred ! - Noel? - Noel's wishy-washy. - Christopher, then. - Are you sure? Yeah? And? - We're late. - Let's go. Think so? Well, yes, I mean. . . you have to be in love. You have to trust the person. You still believe in Prince Charming? Hang on, I think. . . I could do it with a guy I didn't know, who I didn't like, and I'd never see again. Then you're rid of them. Really? But I thought with Sebastian, you wanted. . . Sebastian is different. Because I read in my horoscope that I'd do it with him. . . Well, with an Aries, and since he's Aries. . . I said it would be him. But do you love him? Yes, I love him, but. . . It's not the same thing. Anyway, if I don't do it with Sebastian, it'll be someone else. The main thing is to do it. Hang on. . . we'll see. - We'll do it or we won't. - Are you kidding? We'll do it. Because we said we'd do it together, and I want to do it this summer. So we will. It's great! You're beautiful ! Lt suits you ! Leave your speech on the table! I have the whole week to write it. - You haven't done it? - Don't worry. I know you, you'll arrive empty-handed. Bye! You'll look an idiot at the reception ! I’m going to come choose my second son-in-law. Because the one your sister brought home. . . You're mean ! I’m Just kidding. But I am going to look them over, you can't trust boys! You won't embarrass me, dad ! That's not funny! OK, I'll leave you here defenseless. Bye, dad. Have fun, see you next week. I'll come and get you. Everyone's here already. Sebastian, nine o'clock. He looked at me. He looks at all the girls. Stop it, you shouldn't say things like that. If that's how it is, I’m going to talk to him. Clara and Zoe, we're waiting for you ! Come on, hurry up! Thank you, Sebastian. I’m warning you, no food in the bus! Forget the chips and soda! Can I count on you, Yacine? Stay seated in the bus, please! Severine. No point sighing. - Severine! - OK, I’m going! Alright, listen. ''Audrey and Jean-Pierre, it's the happiest day of your lives. ''You love each other, and this marriage. . . commitment. . . '' That's the word. ''. . . is a wonderful thing. '' Vanessa. . . That's for you. There are some pretty ones. Sir, sir, they're kissing ! There are hotels for that! - Yacine, sit down ! - They're kissing ! I don't care! They're kissing. . . '' Love between a man and a woman is the most precious thing on earth. '' Caresses, languorous kisses. . . 1 800 Kevin. . . Where do you get your rubbers? Do you like sex? What an idiot, you're so busted ! - Jamila, Jamila. . . - That's enough, shit! Jamila. . . She's Just in Morocco, she'll be back. With her cousins, and her cousin's friends. . . - Apparently they're gorgeous. - What? She told me before she left. Who cares? I’m going to do tons of chicks. I’m not worried. I could do Zoe easy, and she's cute, too. I say you don't stand a chance. Don't forget your successes will be videotaped, as will your failures. - Go on. - Good luck. He's going to get knocked back as usual. I have another idea. ''My dear brother-in-law. . . ''Thanks for taking my sister away, so she'll stop pissing me off. '' I doubt she'll like that. Hey, girls. What have you picked, windsurfing or sailing? - Because I know other wet sports. . . - That's OK. You can drop it. You don't know what you're missing. I doubt we're missing very much. Sorry. He got knocked back! Told you. You'd better Just stay faithful. I don't care! Excuse me. . . I Just wanted to say Jerome isn't usually like that. His girlfriend's in Morocco and it's tough for him. That's all. And one more thing. . . - What did he say? - That he thinks I’m pretty. He's so sweet. - At least now I know. - Break's over! Back in the bus! Come on ! You, too, Che Guevara! Stay calm, don't start! Hello, everybody! How are you? - Started contractions yet? - Look who's talking, fatty! OK, get your bags. Calmly, calmly. . . Who threw my bag on the ground? Have a good trip? - A bit long. - A bit tiring, I guess. Once you have your bags, come with us and we'll assign your rooms. That way you can go have a nap later. I need to see you for a minute. . . Come on ! We have to go over two or three things. We're going to have a drink and get to know each other. First, I want to introduce your instructors for the week. To the far left is Greg, who teaches sailing and windsurfing. To his right is Theo, for surfing. Romeo, without his Juliet, and finally the handsome Julian, our Bob Marley stand-in. They're all so cute! They're kind of old. Hang on. . . Pay attention, please, and listen. Classes will be in the morning from 1 0: 00 to 1 2: 30, and the afternoon from 2: 00 to 5: 30. That's Sonia Axel. God, she's cool ! Breakfast is from 8: 00 to 9: 30 am, lunch from 1 2: 00 to 1 : 30 pm, and dinner from 7: 30 to 8: 30 pm. I think she looks like a bitch ! And no noise in your rooms after 1 0 pm. So, you decided to come? - Didn't I inform you? - No, you didn't. Who do you think you are? Listen, we'll try to find you a room for tonight. Really. . . Yes, go ahead ! Go ahead, get something to drink. . . Thank you everybody! Clara. . . Yacine. . . come here. The bastard, he's gonna do her! Shit, the bastard ! Really discreet, guys! I don't like it when you're unhappy! I’m such a loser when it comes to guys. No, you're not. They're Just Jerks, that's all. They're not Jerks, they're real Jerks! You're going to have to learn to do something with guys. . . What? Guess. I don't know. You're going to have to learn. . . to defend yourself! Stop it! Go on, defend yourself! Stop it! There, I won. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Sonia, if you please. . . We've sorted out your room. Come with me, I’ve found you a nice little room. Hey, there's a little party tonight on the roof. I'd like it if you came. Thanks. Want to go? If you like. You know Sonia Axel? I'd do her wherever and whenever she likes! I doubt she'd like. What makes you say that? I was thinking we were too young for them ! Got any hash? We were going to try the supermarket, but it's closed. She's making fun of you ! When you crash a party, bring something. Or what good are you? Goodbye! Lt was Just a Joke. You're laughing. . . Can I have an apology, please? - Yacine, did you apologize? - In writing, it's in the mail. Maybe you'd like to apologize in front of your friends! What are you playing at? You're Just as stupid as all your friends! Stop it! What's going on? Zoe, calm down, now! What is all this? What do you think you're doing? What do you have there? Are you all nuts? Look at the state she's in ! Severine, if you keep this up, you'll regret it. That goes for all of you ! Any beer or Joints, you're going home, and I'll call your parents! I’m not a fool, Che! Calm down, sir. Get out of here! You're all wasted ! I’m ashamed of you ! That's enough ! - Get going. - I love you, sir! Yeah, that's it. Severine, you're an idiot! You crushed my finger! Good ! - God, you're mean ! - And you're stupid. And that's being nice! You know, that last time. . . when we kissed, I was really moved. I think I'm in love with you, Clara. Why do you say that? Because I love you. You love me? Yes. Guys are all idiots, and. . . maybe it would be better if it were Just the two of us. You like it when we kiss, too. But girls can't love girls! It's not girls I love. . . It's you, and since always. Don't mix everything up, we're friends. I’m not mixing everything up. I know you want me, too. No, stop. I don't want to talk about this, it's not normal. Here's the first exercise. You're going to lie on the board. . . chest up, back arched. . . and paddle on the sides of the board. OK? Lt will give you a feel for how the board moves in the water. Got it? Go straight ahead. Come on, a little effort! Zoe. . . I want to apologize for last night. Because I was a real idiot, and. . . I’m really sorry. OK, that's enough. Come back in. Turn around and come back to the beach ! - Want a hand? - No, it's OK. Are you sure? I don't need your help. Christ, you really have a shitty disposition ! Can't you move on? I’m trying to patch it up and you won't even let me. Hang on. Help me, my arms hurt. Lt doesn't matter. I don't think that'll work. . . That's going to make it tough. Sebastian is still a better teacher than you ! He's holding your board for you ! He's holding your board, it's easy! - Thanks. - You can go that way. - Quick, or they'll be dressed ! - I’m on it. That's good. It's wicked, guys, seriously. . . That's it, that's it! - Shit, what a good idea! - She's gorgeous. I'd do Severine any day! Check out those melons! Oh, no, don't get dressed ! Too cool ! God, this is great. What are you doing? - Shit, Clara! - Let's get out of here! Quick, guys, we've got to catch her! You'd better not open your mouth about what you saw. Why not? Shit, you're dumb! Because I said so! Do what you want, I don't give a damn. If you don't want a shitty vacation, keep quiet. - Keep your mouth shut! - Get out of here. Shit! She's lucky we didn't get mad. Watch out in the showers, Kevin and those guys are filming. I know, Seb told me earlier. - Seb? - Yeah, he told me on the beach. You're still talking to him? After what he did to you? It's OK, it's not his fault. His friends are idiots, but he's nice, he apologized. He's really a good guy. What's up? Why are you looking at me like that? I was thinking we could try the catamaran, today. I don't really feel like doing group stuff. I wanted to be alone with Sebastian, so we're going to go bodyboarding. Never mind. Make sure you keep things tidy, watch the cords. And never untie the sail when you're on the beach. OK? Greg. . . I don't get this. Kevin and Marc, you're getting on my nerves. This is your third boat, now. You do it. Think a bit, use your head. That won't work, so. . . - I go this way. - That's better. Slip it through the middle. Once. . . Twice. . . There, now pull it tight. Careful, you'll damage the sail. Loosen it a bit, give it some slack, slip it under. . . The wind has turned a bit, so we'll turn the boats. Take the front of the boat and point it in that direction. Everybody get on it, let's go. - Can I Join in? - Clara, perfect timing. Morgan, come over here! I’ve found you a partner, so you can go. I don't have a boat prepared, since she was alone. The boys and I will bring one over, we'll get it ready and we'll all go together. Alright, girls? Yeah, and you? Watch out! Come on, a bit more. . . Now change direction, Clara! Change sides, come on ! Watch out for the others! - OK, Morgan, there you go! - Like that? That's good, girls! OK, let's go! - Check it out! Who is that? - Yacine. He's going over. . . Shit, there he goes! He Jumped ! Who overturned? It's Yacine. I'll take care of it, you guys stay still. Stay there, I'll deal with them and I'll be back. What do you think of Che? He's nice. I think I'm a bit in love with him. I'd like to give him something, but I don't know what he'd like. I thought flowers. Not flowers, that's not his style. Write him a poem. Yeah, that's a good idea. - Tell me when ! - You guys counterbalance, let's go. Get on the hull. . . Now get back on the boat. Get a move on ! I’m up! Now get your tiller back in place. You OK? Let's get back to the others! That was great. Fix the cord. . . Watch where you're going. . . Watch where you're going, take the tiller! So. . . Life Jackets at the back on the nails. Wetsuits on the hangers. One wetsuit per hanger, I don't want you doubling up. There's room for everyone, so you can spread out. I ripped it up skateboarding. I’m going to rip it up, later, you'll see. . . Was it good today? What did you do? - Zoe, hurry up! - Coming. ''Sometimes, when I see you. . . ''lost in the confusion. . . '' I have but one desire. . . - ''To take you in my arms. '' - Careful, that's direct! Hang on, I don't remember the rest. You should learn it. ''Your eyes are wonderful. . . ''And your voice frees me. . . '' Not seeing you drives me to despair. . . ''And losing you would be more than I could bear. '' Fuck off! The females lay their eggs in the nest. - Stop it! - Those are females? The others are the males. They're fucking ! - What's going on? - They're fucking, sir! Look! - That's enough. - They're fucking ! - Come on. . . - It's nature. - Alright. - Alright for them, mostly! - OK, we're going to play boules. - Balls? Enough, Yacine, I have a headache. That's enough. You're going to play boules here! - Can I have some quiet, please? - And some fucking. Let's see. Hang on. . . Me, too, I want some. Let's see. Nice full lips. . . You're getting it everywhere! Wait. . . That's good. Calm down, it's good ! How do you like me? - Shall we go? - Come on. Emily and Virginia, my sisters. Don't touch ! Shut up! No, that's not it. '' I am a girl. . . '' Lt has a certain charm. People like it or they don't. . . I’m not a fan. Lt hurts, here. Want me to give you a massage? - Want to go to the beach? - Why not? Morgan, Clara, you're not dressed? You don't want to Join the sports? My back hurts a bit today. And I don't feel like it. Why are you here? - To get a tan? - No, to do sports. That's why your parents sent you. Healthy mind, healthy body. 2: 00 pm at the landing stage! - Zoe. . . - What? Will you lighten up? Can you stop sulking? There's nothing with me and Vanessa. Really? I promise. Hurry up. Are you both singing? I’m not with the band. - Sorry, I'll leave you to it. - I'll go. Sorry. . . Sorry. - You have a pretty voice. - Think so? I’m a singer, in fact. I’m recording an album in Toronto this fall. How did you get the gig? - What? - How did you get the gig? Casting couch. I’m kidding. I didn't believe you anyway. Why not? My fault. You're not doing any sports. No, I didn't sign up. I didn't really want to and. . . I’m here because my parents wanted to get rid of me. I scare them, we don't understand each other. Mine are the same, they call me Wednesday. - What? - Wednesday, from the Addams family. - With the ponytails. . . - Right, and the white face. I get that every day. You were doing Karate before, right? Last time I saw you? No, it's a kind of breathing exercise. It's to make you. . . - It's Sonia and Clara? - What are they up to? Are they making out, or what? They're making out! It's true, shit! They're dykes! They're touching ! Hang on, I don't know if. . . Feel it expand? Hang on, shit. . . Fuck, guys, I have to tell you something ! With a girl from the tennis club! Vanessa saw them, and she told Severine. - Sonia? - I'd never have thought it. Hang on, not Clara! Vanessa! Come here a second. Zoe, do you know Sonia? Sonia Axel? - Guess who we saw her with. - Clara. You remember what I told you ! No, no way. Hang on, I saw Sonia with a chick! You've got nice firm legs! Stop that! I was Just Joking you. For a Joke, learn to speak properly. Careful of that lisp! I love lesbians. Want to borrow my pink top? No, thanks. Lt looks really good on you. It's OK. I don't understand why everyone's laughing at me. Lt can't be much fun. Can't we stop being mad at each other? If you like. If it'll make you happy. In fact. . . want to know why everyone's laughing? Why? Do you know? It's because of Sonia. She's a lesbian, didn't you know? So when you're seen together, it makes us laugh. That's bullshit! Think so? She's too pretty! All the guys are nuts about her. You're Just messing with me. No, why? And the guy with the convertible? I even saw them on the beach. He's her cousin. Sebastian knows him, he told me. Hello, everybody, how are you doing tonight? Hello, everybody, how are you doing tonight? I asked you how you're doing? They're hot! That's good, that's good. . . They've got guts, you can give them a big round of applause. . . We're going to let them play now, what do you say? Tonight we have for you the band Amapaz! Do you want to hear them or not? - Alright? - Yeah, and you? I’m having a blast. Me, too, like a lunatic! What's up? You're tired? See you tomorrow? - You're there! - No, I’m not. I was going to bed. - What are you doing? - Nothing. He looked nice, the guy with the dreads earlier. You seeing him? Ludo? Not at all. Good party. You're so popular with guys! It's. . . What do you want to know? Nothing, I’m Just talking. What do you want to talk about? Nothing in particular. The others didn't say anything. Anyway, I don't care. Don't care about what? That I like boys, and girls too? Are you shocked? You have to relax, Clara. - My love. . . - Thanks, thanks. Are you ready? Oh, that's cool ! Please. . . No, but it's. . . Should I kiss the winner or the referee? - Who's the referee? - It's you ! Revenge match ! Don't get carried away! OK, that's good. Ready? Revenge match, shit. . . You're not up to it, he's bigger!

We'll try some local specialties. . . Can she come? No problem. Julian suggested a restaurant tonight. . . I said we could go try some local specialties at my friends' restaurant, it should be fun. Can we meet back here in an hour? I have tons of work to do. - Great. - It's a plan. See you later. - Want to? - Yes! We're not going to stay here! Come on, I’m kidnapping you. Freedom isn't doing everything you like. . . it's knowing why you want to do things. Because. . . You see, it's. . . Hey, dykes! Groping each other in corners? - Some pussy-licking coming up? - Sex, sex! How about a private show? - Just between us! - Yeah, in private. - '' Pussies in Heat!'' - Cool, you could film them, and send it to her mother! She'll love knowing her daughter's a pervert! Leave my mom out of this. She understands, it's cool. Then tell me why she sent you away from home. Get lost! The dyke bites! I’m not a lesbian. - She looks like one. - Totally. And tell us why you hide for your dirty games with Sonia. We're talking ! Besides, two girls together, I can't see the point. Yeah, wriggle out of it. I'll tell you the point. - They're Just here to peep! - And you're not? Come on, I'll help you peep at chicks! Let go of me, fuck! - Yacine. . . - Let go! What are you doing? Come on ! Let go! Go on ! Getting wet yet, dyke? What are you doing, guys? - You're getting wet! - Let me go! - Let her go! - Fuck! Are you idiots? Don't sweat it, it was a Joke, that's all. - What did you do to her? - Nothing, fuck! - Then why's she like that? - Stop making such a big deal ! It's nothing, shit happens. It's not my fault! The girl's Just oversensitive. I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. I don't know what got into me, I couldn't say a word. . . - I’m really. . . - Lt doesn't matter. It's not your fault. It's Just that. . . it's tough, sometimes. You're not mad? I need to be alone. Zoe, can I talk to you? I'll take off. I’m sorry. I was a real idiot. All of this is my fault. - I want you and me to. . . - To what? You said you wanted us to be together. I thought. . . I don't love you anymore. I made love to Sebastian. You see. . . Because of you, I almost gave up on boys. It's much more of a turn-on with Sebastian. He kisses super well, and it's really nice. And. . . in fact. . . guys are easy, you Just can't be afraid. You have a problem with guys, Clara, not me. Marc! Can you come here a minute? What's up? No, it's nothing ! It's Just. . . I was thinking we haven't had a chance to talk, and it's a shame we haven't got to know each other. That, no! That's enough ! Not during classes! Stop laughing, or I'll call your parents. Got it? Get your boards! Forget it, he's Jealous. You don't let up! - Come back in five minutes? - No, we're staying. No, hang on, we're rehearsing ! - Am I bugging you? - After the song, it's fine. Did you think it was forever? Look how old I am ! Calm down. It's the vacation and I’m having fun. Get a grip! And don't say anything to the others! Go have fun with your friends, and let me have fun. No, I understood, it was Just a fling for me. - I hope so. - Just don't make me look stupid. - But the others don't know. - I’m not. . . I’m a guy! If you'd rather be with Severine than me, fine! That's not it, we were Just writing a song ! I don't care. What a leech, that guy! He won't let go! You know, like in that song ''Together Never''. . . '' Never Together'', you mean. What do you want? - Sorry? - What? I’m not bugging you, so leave me alone. Sorry, we didn't know we were disturbing your privacy! Get out of here! You need help! You're nuts! Come on, let's go. They're all the same. . . neurotic. Clara, are you OK? - Are you OK? - What are you doing? - What? - Don't Jump on people like that! I thought you were drowning ! What if I want to drown? Hang on, hang on. . . Hang on, you're freezing. Are you alright? Wait. . . You don't love me. - What? - You don't love me. . . We'll never see each other again. Will you kiss me? No, Clara. Hang on. . . What are you doing? - Not like that. - Don't you want me? That's not it, but it's going too fast! That's not how it happens. - How does it happen? - We could talk, first. But I don't want to talk, Just to let myself go. No, not like that. You were in the water, you're cold, you're upset. . . - I can't! It's not. . . - You don't want me. That's not it! Got a cigarette? Got a light? - Zoe? - She's not here. Wait, Sebastian. . . I have to talk to you ! - What makes you say that? - She told me. What, exactly? Zoe and I have known each other for years. We tell each other everything. And she told me she didn't get off with you. She said she was faking? But it's kind of like she wants to prove something. Prove what? Prove she's capable of sleeping with a guy. In reality. . . I think girls are more her thing. Zoe likes girls? - That's reassuring. - I’m not kidding. She came on to me, once. It's really not my thing. But since that day, her goal is to make it with a guy. And she picked me. Thanks for everything you've told me. No problem. - Hi, feeling better? - Much. Listen, about last night. . . There's nothing to say. Lt would have been stupid. Give it to me. . . I could whack you one! You're getting on well with Sebastian. - Not bad. - He said he thought you were nice. Or funny, rather. He was dying laughing. You see, Clara, you've got it all wrong. We haven't done it yet. What? We haven't slept together yet. You lied to me, that's disgusting ! Me? You're the bitch ! Why did you tell him all that? Are you Jealous, or what? That's not it! I was too unhappy. Lt was too hard for me. What's hard for you? That I’m happy without you? I don't know, I'm Just in a bad state right now. - You can't Just drop me. - Why not? Because I need you. You see, Clara. . . You're unhappy because I’m happy. You only like me when I’m unhappy. But you won't understand that. My mother makes it, it's a real Joy. My mother makes it, it's a real Joy. Clara, come and taste this. His mom makes it. - Come on. - A liqueur, from plants. It's wonderful, you'll be soaring. You're going to let go and have some fun for once! Come on. Look at this! You're going to smell this, it's a real Joy. Smell that. Not bad, hey? What do you think? It's an oil lamp! You told me your bedside lamp. . . You said it was broken. I’m not going to feed alcohol to a minor! And if you want something cheesier, I'll bring the lampshade. That'll be cool, right? I'd better go, I’m in a rush. I'll see you later, OK? Later, careful of the lamp. It's nice of him. Something wrong? It's nothing, it's Zoe. What's up? She's gone off with Sebastian. She left you for Sebastian? We used to tell each other everything. We were always together. Now it's like she wants to hurt me. Maybe she's seeing Sebastian for herself. It's not necessarily to hurt you. No, she's mean. You think Zoe's mean because Sebastian has taken your place. Maybe. What's going on with Clara? Nothing's going on. You were best friends, and suddenly, nothing. I don't know. You're Jealous of Sonia. Stop it, I’m not Jealous of Sonia! - Yes, you are. - No, it's Just that. . . Clara is my best friend but. . . it's not like it used to be. - You were with Clara. - No, I wasn't! Yes, you were together. We weren't together! Stop it, you're horrible! I’m not horrible, there's nothing wrong with two girls being together. It's great, I like that. I like girls. That's your problem, you like girls too much. She hurt me! Stop touching me! What is it this time? And you, Morgan ! I don't want to hear another sound ! Got that? Not a sound ! I have an idea! What if we spent the day together. . . all day on the beach, Just us. A little isolated beach, I know one near here. Julian can take us, and we'll spend all day together. All alone. Shit, yes! That would be great! Just the two of us in peace, finally! - You really want to? - Totally! Hang on, it's Saturday. . . Yeah, I think so. Shit, I have my sister's wedding ! But you can come. Hang on. . . If you. . . Want to? I don't know, won't it pose a problem? No, not at all ! Unless you'd rather. . . Unless you'd rather stay here. Weddings are boring. Are you serious? - Yes, come. - I'd love to! You want to? Why all the politeness? I love weddings. They're super cheesy, the family doesn't know what to say. . . Seriously, I love them. - You're coming, then. - Great. Then don't go, if you don't want to. I’ve known Clara for years, and my folks will be there. I have to. But if you have to go, why did you ask me? Hang on, she was coming out of Sonia's bedroom? I swear it! Did she say anything to you? No, we Just saw. . . But it's hot! It's a disgrace! Why? Severine dumped you ! - She dumped you, too! - She didn't dump me. I gave her to Marc, it's not the same. - You guys are such loudmouths! - It's them, I didn't say a word. You don't mind if I go? No, I'll Just never see you again. You're pretty when you're sad. You're not funny. How's it going? Calm down. . . Careful ! Get out of here, now. - Get out of here, she said ! - That's enough ! - Catamaran, wind surfing. . . - Tons of stuff. That's great. Hi, honey, how are you? Sonia and I have met. Shall we go? In the car. - Won't Audrey get pissed off? - Why would she? You know how organized she is. An extra person. . . - It's nothing ! - It's her wedding. Exactly. If you like, but. . . What are you doing? Go after her! You don't have to pretend for my sake. You think I’m going out with her? Because I wasn't there last night? Then why be so mean? Because she's getting on my nerves. She won't leave me alone, even you think we're together. Lt pisses me off! And if you want to know where I was last night, I was with the musician. - Which one? - The singer. What about you and Seb? We still haven't. You went all the way? It's not that big a deal. It's true I was lucky, I found a guy with experience. Did you like it? He wanted it so much. . . I Just let myself go. What was it like? I can't explain. . . But you'll see, it's great. - Clara, Zoe, get a move on ! - We're coming ! Come on, in the car. If you'll give me your bouquet, and your gloves. . . I welcome you to my parish with great Joy. You have my best wishes. We are gathered here because Audrey and Jean-Pierre have invited us to celebrate their wedding, and to participate in their Joy. You may be seated. We will now hear the word of God. ''At that time, ''Jesus told the crowd this parable. ''The kingdom of Heaven ''may be compared to a man ''who sowed good seed in his field. '' Your speech, darling. Audrey and Jean-Pierre, congratulations. It's the happiest day of your lives. This commitment you're making symbolizes your love for each other and that's the most beautiful thing on earth. Love between a man and a woman is the most beautiful thing that happens. That can happen. Clara's very moved. Yeah, right. . . she hasn't written anything. Apart from the love you'll have for your children, later. What's up with her? I told you, she's moved. What's wrong? What's going on? I slept with Sonia. I kind of guessed. Didn't you sleep with the musician? Yes. But with him, it was horrible. Because you weren't in love with him. Not with Sonia, either. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Anyway, I liked it. Then maybe you prefer girls. Maybe. I’m ashamed. Don't worry, it'll be fine. And you know. . . It's not a tragedy to prefer girls. Lt Just means having children will be a little more difficult. But it doesn't matter, there are modern methods. I’m going. - Where? - To see Sonia, I was horrible. I'll come with you. Your parents will be so mad ! What will you say to her? I don't know. You're kidding? We didn't do all this for you to have nothing to say! Sonia's a nice girl. It's not easy. I have an idea. You go and see her, you don't say a word, you bring her back. I can Just see my dad's face! Dad, I'd like to introduce your new son-in-law. Well, you told me not to trust boys. . . So obviously. . . And your mother! She'll be like: ''Clara!'' No, seriously, what are you going to say? We'll see.
