The culprit made his way to the examination room. How can we just bury the case? If Nurse Park was involved, we could be in danger, too. Don't let your past ruin you, now. What took you so long in coming here? My deepest apologies, ma'am. Wol-ryung was my maid for a long time. How did she die? She was hung by the rafters to look like a suicide. But she was murdered. How absurd... How can something so profane happen inside the palace? It is a plot to harm you, my lady. They plot to cancel the prince's crowning and cast you out. Who put you up to this? Look at this, my lady. This is her medical records made by Nurse Park. It's fabricated. She must've known something. Nurse Park? What are you trying to suggest? Guards! Drag her out of here! Wol-ryung had a baby, ma'am! How dare you... The culprit killed her to conceal it! Let go! Drag her out! I know who it is! I just need the evidence! My lady! Let go! My lady! Please! This is where Nurse Park lived. She must've fallen asleep while lighting a fire. Where is her court record? She had it on her. I asked around for her family but couldn't find any. Wol-ryung? Why are you doing this? If word of Wol-ryung reaches the queen mother, everything will be ruined. But she was the mistress' maid for over 8 years. She should find the truth and... The truth? If a son commits a crime, his father is also punished here. The living can pay for the dead's crime. The queen mother is looking for an excuse to take the prince. Do you know what will happen, if she finds out? You are a threat to us! Throw her in! Watch it, mute! How long do you think you can stay in the palace? Get the point and leave! Let's go! You must go, now or you'll be in danger. Why are you saving me? Can you walk? No need, ma'am. I still plan to solve the case. Let me ask you again. Was Wol-ryung really murdered? Hen find the killer. Any word from the queen mother's quarters? Not yet, sir. Hey, there... You forgot your basket. What is he doing here? Who is that? What did you do in my room! Tell me! You... took the letter, didn't you! That's what you're looking for? I already burned it. I knew it was you! I will unveil that vile mask of yours! If you do, you're going down with me. I am prepared for that. You want to die together, is that it? That would've been better! You think the king will kill his nephew for meddling with a maid? You made me kill the baby, too! You're crazy! My god. Who's there? Who's there? What is that? Where did you get it? Who wrote it? Who did you get it from! Don't you know a maid can be killed for not keeping her chastity? How can you get a letter like this? You're crazy! If anyone sees it, I will be put on trial, too! If you don't burn it now, I'll report you! I mean it! Are you okay, ma'am? Where's the body? Supervising Maid took it. It's been over two weeks. She took it to be cremated... How could you let them take it! - Maid Choi! - You cannot go inside! Let go! Ma'am! Please don't do this. Please go. How can you cremate her when the case isn't solved yet! The case is closed! But ma'am! I found this in her room. It's a love letter. We can compare handwritings and find the culprit! Stop it, ma'am! What happened? No need for you to know. What are you doing? Too-ah-yi... Mo-gua... She gave me a papaya and I sent her a jade. Not just to repay her. But 'tis a sign of eternity with her. Your majesty... To satisfy your majesty... I studied various techniques... How dare you enter his majesty's quarters! Do you all wish to die! Ma'am. You know she is innocent! You said yourself that she stole Wol-ryung's trinket. But... Stealing leads to execution. She will be executed at the ritual tonight. No! Out of my way! There's something in her mouth. What is it? It looks like a secret code. It is Wol-ryung's medical records. It looks like her menstruation dates. Isn't this... Her predicted ovulation date. But that is only calculated for the queen and mistresses. I must go to the library. His majesty's sleeping records. The 20th... It's the same date as when his majesty visited Mistress Hee-bin's quarters. You are a threat to us! Your majesty, it is time. May you be one with the mistress. Your majesty, it is time. May you be one with the mistress. You are the queen mother's maids. You must not forget to set good examples. Do not get mixed with other quarters' maids and stay close. Some maids will be left behind in case the queen mother should call. Will you be okay to stay here alone, ma'am? Just be sure to keep watch on our maids. Are you the one who released Chun-ryung? I must know who killed Wol-ryung. Will you ruin everything because of her, ma'am? Think of the prince. He must become the next king for you and us to survive. I must get rid of Chun-ryung, as I did Nurse Park. Did you kill Wol-ryung, too? Why... I was going to send her out of the palace like you said. You should stay out for awhile. The queen mother is set on anything to stop the prince's crowning. Exit the palace like Nurse Park and wait. You were the one afraid of having her near, not me. What are you saying? She did everything for me! Why would I be afraid of her? She used your things as if they were hers. She took the silk and jewels from his majesty as she wanted. You knew better than I, how avaricious she was. What if the other maids see you? Do you want to get all of us killed? Maids from the queen mother's quarters come by often. I put my life on the line for you, but he is still my son. My breasts are leaking but you won't let me touch him! Now you'll chase me out of court and won't even let me see him? You were incapable of handling her. How dare you! What if she knew Nurse Park was dead? And claimed she's the real mother? You cannot do this to me. After everything I did for you! I cannot have my son be raised by a murderer! There is not one drop of your blood in him. Do you know what this is? This is your court record. But... I burned that myself... Give me the baby! I made him! Who's there? Stop it! Who's there! I will not go down alone! Where are you? Mistress Hee-bin and Wol-ryung were sisters! Everything you see and hear inside the palace... Is linked to the fate of this country. If you speak without permission, your tongue will be pulled out! If you steal something, your hands will be cut off. You have all married into the palace. If you defile your chastity and take in another man. You will be beheaded! Jung-ryul is innocent! No! Let the baby go! Maid Shim? Take her away at once! ?They'll all crazy! This is insane! Get her! What's the matter? Who's there? How dare you wear my robe! Maid Roh! Where are you! My baby shall be King! Did you call, ma'am? Mistress Hee-bin... Give me my baby. You saw the ritual, didn't you? I want my baby. You knew that Maid Shim killed Wol-ryung. Did you give the orders? My baby. This is Wol-ryung's baby! He's mine! There's a dead man here! No! Give me the baby. He shall be king. Will you kill another baby? Take her away. Confess everything now! You know how Maid Shim ended up dying at the ritual! Don't you! Who did you meet in the forest? Do it. Wol-ryung, Nurse Park, Maid Shim they all worked under Mistress Hee-bin. There is a treason connected to the prince's coronation. Isn't there? You know something. Did you find out? She will not open up. His majesty calls all of you inside. Why are you covering up everything? Who are you trying to protect? When I entered the palace... I made a pledge before everyone... To close my eyes... Cover my ears... Shut my mouth... Pretend I did not see... Pretend I did not hear... And pretend I do not know... Don't forget it! Ma'am... Are you okay? Did someone die? The queen mother passed away. Didn't you know? Look at this, ma'am. This states that you've become Mistress Hee-bin's nurse. The crown prince's coronation is under way. You will soon be a physician. Upon the queen mother's will, on this day... I proclaim prince Kyun as the crown prince. Bow! Long live the crown prince! Bow! Long live the crown prince! Bow! Long live the crown prince!
