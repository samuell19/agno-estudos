The summer wind Came blowing in From across the sea It lingered there To touch your hair And walk with me All summer long We sang a song And then we strolled that golden sand Two sweethearts And the summer wind Like painted kites Those days and nights They went flying by The world was new Beneath a blue umbrella sky Then softer than a piper man One day it called to you I lost you I lost you to the summer wind The autumn wind And the winter winds They have come and gone And still the days Those lonely days they go... Hi, Charlie. It's 3:30. I'm taking Beth's 4:00 class 'cause she's got an audition. Sorry I won't be able to make your dinner. Hey, do me a favor, don't cook. - Jesus. - Be good. That never end My fickle friend The summer wind Warm summer wind Where the hell you been? Frankie. How come nobody keeps me waiting when they're looking to borrow it? - You don't want it? You don't want it? - Gimme the money. Gimme the money. - We gotta stop meeting like this. - Gimme the money! Yeah, grazie. - Ronnie, I'm sorry. - Paulie came in late, too. - Paulie came in late? - So I been working short a waiter. Charlie, he's your cousin, but the kid pushes it to the hilt. Hey, tell me about it. I been on the phone with reservations half the day. Christ, don't people know how bad the food is here? Ladies' room toilet overflowed during lunch. To top it off, the old man's upstairs. He's got a bug up his ass this big. - Claims he's being robbed blind. - What else is new? He's not bullshitting, Charlie. He's checking the waiters' dupes. He's checking the dupes tonight? You tell Paulie? I already told Paulie. The party is over for a while. And you're the guy on the line with him. Has Nicky been in yet? He's late, like everybody else around here. Oh, and the machine's been out of Marlboros for a week now. And J3 on the jukebox sticks. Charlie, this bimbo broad you're getting started with, this is Johnny Mack's private stock. Who's getting started? Huh? What am I doing? What did I do? Is Paulie here? Will you give me a break, for Christ's sake? I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey, Paulie, now. Come on. You got it. That's good, Charlie. The house had some nice week here. $195. What do you want for yourself? - Let me grab 15 for cab fare. - You got it. Paulie make his payment? Paulie who? Anything I can get for you? My name is Paulie. If you need anything, you will call me, yes? Absolutely. Hey, Frankie, what number came in today? Brooklyn number? 417. - What'd you have? 325? - No, I had 417. - Not with me, you didn't. - 325. - You got it. - Billy. Walter, any time on table six. You okay with your Shylocks out there? I got a few, if you need it, man. Ronnie warn you about the old man? Paulie, it's serious. Cut that out, you Argentine degenerate. That's my cousin's ass you're rubbing. That's family. This ain't some filthy little jail in Caracas. It's Amer-ii-ca! Where the hell are my clams? We get some fucking plates?! Come on! Keep quiet. Shut up. Just eat, huh? Patty, enjoy the scarol'. Vito, dig in. Everything is taken care of. Alla salute. - Salut'. - Salut'. You like the steak? Who's got the big table? - Maybe Paulie. - Maybe Paulie. - Walter's half whacked. - Walter the cook? Walter the cook. You know another Walter in the place? Somebody's been feeding him vodka. Hey, now what's wrong with this, Paulie? He ordered Beefeater. Says it ain't. Nobody would do that, Charlie. Who'd give that boozer a drink? All the waiters know better. Of course, I can't vouch for the busboys. The big party on table eight? - Let me see the check. - I got their ticket, man. - Let me see the check. - What for? 'Cause you're running a contract at that table, that's what for, and half the dishes aren't on the check. No? We'll borrow a thousand apiece from Frankie Shy and bet it on the check. If you got more than six entrees on it, you win. I count, uh... I count 12 entrees... I count 12 entrees on that table, three of them steaks. Paulie, I'll go you double or nothing whether you got a single fucking steak on that check. Careful on that double or nothing, Charlie. You'll lose your ass on that bet. Gimme the book. Hey, Charlie, you were in. Hey, man, I'm serious. You were in for a ten-spot. Serious, you were in... Six entrees. Six entrees, huh? - You're a greedy bastard, know that? - Charlie... You're a greedy bastard. I had you figured for a sawbuck. You had me figured for a sawbuck. For what, to tide me over when the old man fires me? Relax. That old asshole won't know a thing. Plus you're feeding the cook vodka to get your food out without dupes. Another hour, he's gonna go face-ass down into a bowl of scaloppini. I'm gonna have to go behind the range, blow another $80 shirt. I mean, at least that oughta be enough so you stop screwing me. Screwing you? I wasn't screwing you, Charlie. I had you figured for a sawbuck. Hey, I don't want a sawbuck, all right? I want my job. Cousin or no cousin, that's the last check you rob, capisce? - Capisce. I understand. - You understand me? I'm serious now. Do you understand me? I'm serious now. - Fix your tie. - What? Fix your tie. You're such a fucking slob. - This good? - Go. Do you have my charge tips? No, I'm not done yet, Waldo. Mr. Owner would like to see you after you check out. And you, you little prick... You stole my clams. Hey, Paulie, don't play with him. We're not getting rich in this place, Charlie. You'll never get your own joint like this, never. I mean it, man. We're breaking our ass for nickels... Hey, Paulie, will you give me a break and let me check out, please? Good night, Charles. Charles? Charles. - I'm out. I'm on the street. - He fired you? No, he fired us. They nailed you on that big check. He should die. Die! Die, you old bastard! No, you're the one that should die. Ronnie told you it was my job. Charlie. Hey, man. Hey, man, don't blame me for what that old bastard done to you. He fired you, man, him! - Hey, let me out of here, all right? - Charlie! We were starving in that shithouse. Hey, why don't you grow up, for Christ's sakes, huh? Why don't you just fucking grow up? - Charlie. - Charlie. What? We were like a couple of victims in there. You know, we could do better. We could do a thousand percent better. Hey, man, don't think so small. For once in your life, don't worry about a lousy job, okay? Don't worry about a job? Don't worry about... What the fuck should I worry about, huh? I owe six different department stores, I got two Shylocks I gotta feed... I got Shylocks, too. You ain't alone here. And those other assholes, the stores? You got no job now. They can't collect no money off you. Why can't you just admit you was wrong, huh? Why can't you just say, "Charlie, I was wrong"? - Wrong? - Yeah, wrong. Where was I wrong? What did you say? - I said where was I wrong? - Where was you wrong? Ronnie told you not to rob. You robbed. That got me fired. You was wrong. You understand that? You were wrong. You understand that? - I didn't figure I'd get caught. - You didn't figure... Look, man, if I figured I'd get caught, I'd be a thousand percent wrong. But if I didn't figure I'd get caught, then I wasn't jeopardizing your job. Hey, don't you understand, Charlie... - Hey! - Keep your hands off me. - Look what you did to my suit. - I'm sorry. What do you need a fancy suit for, Charlie? You got no job to wear it to, man. - What did you say? - Come on. Huh? Say that again. Say it again. Say it again. Say... say what you just said again. About my suit. Say... say... what do I don't need? Tell me what I don't need. What do you need a fancy suit for, Charlie? You got no job to wear it to, man. That's right. Why? Here's your button. Come on, man. Hey, man, let's go watch the sun come up like the old days. Hey, Charluccio! We'll sit and have a couple of cognacs like gentlemen! Hey, let me tell you something. I don't have time to sit and watch the sun come up. Capisce? I don't have time. I could teach another aerobics class. There's some models trying out for a commercial. It would mean a few extra dollars next week. Great. Oh, Wallach's wants 300. Or they're gonna give it to a collection agency. We can cut back a little, too. We eat out a lot more than we have to. - You gonna cook? - I can cook. You can cook. You can't cook. I don't fucking believe this. I don't... I don't believe this. She's got 11 months' worth of parking tickets here. - The fucking bitch. - Who? Who? Cooky. Who else? Cooky. She's still got the Buick in my name. God damn it. Let her pay them. It's only fair. How can you say "Let her pay"? Every penny that she gets comes from me. Jesus Christ! It's almost two grand. She must be parking on the fucking sidewalk. - Take the car back. - Take the car back. She got three brothers who belong in a zoo. I take the car back, they'll start a war over that thing. - So what are you gonna do? - I'll manage. So what are you talking about then? Why you being such a cooze, huh? Was that an accident? Huh? Was that an accident? - I don't think so. - Jesus Christ. Why did you do that? I'm sorry. You can hit. Finding a job will pick you up. You'll get your reflexes back. I think I already got my reflexes back. The summer wind Came blowing in From across the sea It lingered there To touch your hair And walk with me All summer long We sang a song And then we strolled that golden sand Two sweethearts And the summer wind Like painted kites Those days and nights They went flying by The world was new Beneath a blue umbrella sky... Hey, Charlie Moran. How the hell are you, huh? - How you doing? - What's happening, baby? - I'm not doing any good in there. - You know anybody who does? - So what's happening? How's Cooky? - Cooky's history. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Don't worry. So, what's happening with you? What are you doing? - Waiting. - You're waiting? For what? Work. Charlie, I'm not gonna bullshit with you now. I swear to God, business is off with me. I'm down 35% on my dinners. You're up against a wall, you come in by me, I put you out on the floor a couple of shifts a week. You work as a waiter, okay? - Work as a waiter? - Yeah. - I look like a waiter to you, huh? - No. I'm offering you a job. - You want to put me on as a waiter? - Gonna get mad at me over this? - I offer you a job... - I wouldn't work in your restaurant... - Do me a favor. Go fuck yourself, okay? - Hey. Fucking creep, you! Maybe you should take a waiter's job until something better opens up. Diane, give me a break, huh? Just a thought. What do you want me to do, you want me to save up my little tip cup every night? In 20 years, maybe I'll have enough to own a place? It's honest work, Charlie. Something I learned a long time ago about honest work. When people tell you they got honest work for you, know what they got? - What? - A shit job. That's what they got. Do you ever think we don't have to own the restaurant to move to the country, Charlie? You could find a job managing a place. I could get work. Diane, I'm not gonna head up to Maine, you know, start chopping wood. When we leave the city, I'm gonna leave as an owner. How are you gonna see your son when you leave? - You think about it? - I'll work it out. What's the sudden interest in my kid? It's not sudden. I'm curious. Doesn't it bother you to only see Vinnie once a week? Yeah, it bothers me. Yeah. It bothers me. When Cooky and I first split up, I used to see the kid every other day. I used to take him to the zoo. I took him to the ferry. I dropped money at every Carvel stand in the city. - And? - And what? Then Cooky and her scumbag brothers used to knock me down all week long. Bang, bang, bang. No mercy. So by the time I got the kid, I got nothing but tight lips and a frown all day. It might be different if it was our kid. Not at this point in my life. I mean, you know. You know, maybe down the road sometime. But not right now. Why not right now? Because I got my back against the wall right now, that's why. I got no job right now. You want me to put it a different way for you? I'm outta work right now. I got no money, capisce? I got two Shylocks I gotta carry on my back. I got a marshal who wants to put a lien on my salary when and if I get a salary, all right? I got an ex-wife and I got a kid I gotta feed every week. Listen to you, Charlie. You're always saying "I." "I got two..." Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, Diane! Don't play games with me, all right? - I'm not playing games with you. - What do you wanna do, you wanna fight? - Shut up, damn it! Fuck off! Piss off! - Hey! What do you wanna do? Look, I'm going to go bang around the Village for a while, right? I need a dose of sanity in my life. Yeah, hey. Charlie? - Charlie! - What? What do you want? What do you want? What? What do you want? What? What do you want? Speak. What do you want? - I'm pregnant. - Come over here. Come over here. Come over here. Come over here. Come over here right now. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't come over here. Don't come over here. Grandpa used to have hundreds of birds he used to keep up here on the roof. He had all different kinds. He had tipplets. He had flights. He had tumblers. He had nuns. You know what nuns are? They're pigeons. One of the most beautiful flocks in the whole Village was up here in this coop. They used to have pigeon wars over these birds. Grandpa used to stand up here with a stick. He used to go like this. He used to bring all the birds home. Hey, Vinnie, most of your grandfather's time up here was spent cleaning up bird shit, it was. Hey, Vinnie, tell your old man to listen. Cousin Paulie's got something cooking. He's gonna thank me for getting us out of that sentence we were serving at Sal's. - Hey, I wanna find my own job alone. - Job? Job? Who's talking about a job? I'm talking about a move, man. I'll pass. How can he pass on something he don't even hear, Vinnie? I don't know. This is a score, man. Nice and easy. And the guy I'm in with is a pro, Charlie. An absolute pro, man. Yeah? Well, you're an amateur, like me. We're not professional thieves, Paulie. Where you been? I'm waiting a God damn an hour. - I gotta go shopping. - Cooky, don't bust my balls, all right? Come on, honey. - Jesus Christ. - Hey, Dad. - Oh, wonderful, wonderful. - Come on, honey. She'll have you paying taxes if you're not careful, man. They're all the same. They like you to think small, you know? Paulie, a couple of weeks out of work, you're gonna start thinking small, too. Tips, pay, plus what you robbed, you were bringing home 600 a week. Where you gonna find that, huh? Where you gonna find that, huh? You take a girl out, you drop 100 bucks. Hey, more than 100, Charlie. I mean, I like to look good, you know? Lobsters, some wine, a couple of sambucas, you know? When I drop 100 on my night off, I figure I got away cheap, you know, like I robbed 50. Soon money ain't gonna be no problem, Charlie. - I got something big going for me, man. - Oh, yeah? What? I own a piece of a thoroughbred. - A what? - A thoroughbred. A fucking racehorse, Charlie. I'm in with Tommy Botondo and Jimmy the Cheese Man. Five thou apiece we went for. - Where did you get 5,000? - I went on the street for it. - On the street? - Yeah. - What are you, stunat? - Hey, man, we got a score set up. If you would listen, money ain't gonna be no problem. Paulie, what do you or Jimmy the Cheese Man know about horses? I don't have to know nothing in this deal. I got in on a swindle with this horse. This horse's father won the Belmont Stakes, man. Any horse wins the Belmont Stakes, the yearlings go for maybe 600 big ones. That's exactly it. We got her for 15 grand, man. It was like shoplifting, buying this horse. Have you ever heard of artificial inspiration? It don't just work with people, Charlie. See, horses can have babies by artificial inspiration, too, man. Like, let's say you got a couple of horses worth... a million dollars apiece. You don't wanna set 'em loose in some field to screw. I mean, how many times you yourself pull a muscle or something screwing? And these great big stallions, man, they get horny, they could easily kick the mother horse in the head. - Ba-boom. You're out a million dollars. - So what's the point? - Point? - Yeah, what's the point? Jimmy the Cheese Man got in with the groom of this champion horse. We got some of this champion's jism. The groom jerked the horse off. He beat his meat right in the stable. Well, my horse's mother got some of it. You bet horses. You know what that means. Her first race, Starry Hope goes off at big, big odds, man. Her papers say her father was some no-dick piece of garbage, but she got the champion gene, Charlie. - Champion gene? - Yeah. Horses ain't like people, man. They can't make themselves better than they're born. See, with a horse, it's all in the gene. It's the fucking gene that does the running. The horse got absolutely nothing to do with it. Let me ask you something. I mean, how the hell are you gonna make your Shylock payments? - Now, especially? - Exactly like I told you, man. With the nicest, easiest score you ever heard of. Charlie, at least meet the guy, okay? You got nothing to lose by looking it over. There's a real deadline on this, Charlucc'. Starry Hope runs in a couple of weeks, and I need big bucks to bet with, man. There's real money to be made on that race, you know? You know, you ought to get a permit. A permit? For what? To shit in the street. You look like a horse. Paulie, are you sure this guy is all right? That's Barney. What are you doing? I fix clocks here in the Bronx. Antique dealers downtown feed me work. Chimes, mostly. You can make a good living in this city doing nothing but chimes. Chimes, man. Yeah, chimes. I get it. Can you still open safes? Some. The kind we'll run into on this job I can get into. Yeah? What kind can't you get into? - What kind? - Yeah. Banks. Big jewelry houses. Anything wired up to Holmes. I'm not a big-time safecracker. I'm a hotshot locksmith. People got a half million to protect, they buy the kind of box I don't know how to get into. - Are you sure about opening this one? - If it ain't wired, I can get into it. - Your buddy boy says it ain't wired. - Guaranteed. I seen it, man. You done any time, Barney? Goes back to '47. I did a pound at Green Haven. Hey, what the fuck is this, huh? What the fuck is this? We giving lifetime references here? I did five years in the joint. Five years. End of story, huh? '47, Charlie. Either of you guys have an automobile out there? - Yeah. - Better hurry. The summons man is blitzing the street with his little fleet of tow trucks. Tow trucks! Shit! He's the only police officer in this city that sets the hook himself. Hey! It's my car. It's my car. - Hey, I'll move it, Officer. - Lift her. Hey! That ain't right, and you know it, man! Hey, Officer, I get here before you hook me, you're supposed to let me go. I still gotta take a ticket, but you're not supposed to tow me. Take it away! Cocksucker. That rat bastard was supposed to let me go. He doesn't let anyone go. He hooked Monsignor Ryan's Coupe de Ville last Saturday while the Monsignor was in saying the 8:00 mass. The man is possessed. He should die of hemorrhoids. It's gonna cost you $100 for the tow, plus $25 for the ticket. And that fat bastard comes in here every afternoon like clockwork to piss in my toilet and drink my whisky free. He knows there's two first-class locks on that building. Take me an hour to go through them. The other one, I go through with a toothpick. Crossing that alley to the other roof is a piece of cake. We go inside, I open the safe and we find peanuts in there, I'm gonna want your ass, Paulie. Charlie, this is A1, guaran-fucking-teed, man. Go ahead and sleep on it. Paulie, before I go to sleep on it, just how sure are you of the 50 thou? They deliver to some kind of small chemical plant, COD. Payment in green. And there's 15 trucks out there. - And it all goes in the safe? - Every penny. They get back too late for the banks. Friday's receipts sit over the weekend. Charlie, we've been through this again and again. What is he, stunat'? What do you mean? He's like a wackadoo. Noodles and an egg roll. How much? Hey, what's the matter with you, Barney? Hey, man, you'll die if you eat that shit. This guy is selling instant hepatitis here. It ain't nothing but warm germs going here. Charlie, we're gonna lose our partner here, man. This upazz' bought a horse. What's your story? Come here, Charlie. With these eyes, four more years, they're gonna tell me to buy a shepherd. I'm 58. I got a 25-year-old retarded kid my wife won't let go of. I've a two-family house, a little left on the mortgage. I might see some extra bucks every month if the neighborhood don't go colored. Colored, man. I need one nice score now so the kid's got something going for him. - One nice score. - Right. Absolutely. Hey, Paulie, where the hell you gonna keep that horse you bought? - I thought you live on Carmine Street. - At the racetrack, for Christ's sake. It ain't a fucking pet, Barney. It's a racehorse, okay? Huh. Hey, either one of you do any time? - What, are you nuts?! - Hey, Barney, whoa. Do I look like I could afford to do any time? I'm no tough guy. They send me upstate, some big militant begunda's gonna grab me in the shower and "ram it up yo' ass!" - Fuck that shit. - It's no joke. All this talk about doing time makes me nervous. Are you in, Charlie, or what? Is there gonna be money in that safe? Yes, man. For the tenth time, yes. Barney, don't eat this shit. Give me this. - Hey, come on. Stop. What the fuck? - It ain't good for you, Barney. I paid two bucks for it! Gimme the two bucks! - Hey, Bunky. - Hey, Nunzi. Who's the guys? The Chinks? They're okay. They're with Eddie. - How's the calamari? - Mm. Hey, Bunky, the fight next week, you still got a hook-up for tickets? Yeah, but let me know how many. Tomorrow, I'll give you a call. Will you give me a break with that smoke? What's the matter? No scungilli tonight? My stomach's a little sour. I wanna eat bland for a while. You could have a wire that big underneath all that sauce. You're the cop. You're supposed to be wired, not me. No more, Eddie. Don't you read the newspapers? All the cops are getting pinched now. Wise guys, they're too busy testifying. You're right. Yeah, everything is upside down out there. The whole world is upside down. Listen, uh... I hear you're having a little trouble with Carlucci. Put something in your mouth, Bunky. It's good. The brass, they're getting a little nervous, you understand? We're sweetening up the pot this month. You keep everybody calm. There'll be 150 large there. Make your usual pick-up in your usual place. That's all that counts. No? You're right. I remember you. You're the guy... Yeah, I'm the guy who got his car fucking towed. - And you're Jinty, right? - Ginty. - That's what I said. - What the hell are you doing? Don't worry about it, Gint. Here. Put that in your cup. Please God, you're not poisoning the man, are you? It ain't poison. It's horse physic. Hey, pour the ginger ale, man. It's what they give horses when they can't shit. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. How many of those little envelopes do they give to a horse that can't shit? One. One envelope will bust a block of concrete, man. Take a long time to work? It ain't slow. Encore. Yeah. 1013. Uh, Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue. There's an officer down. Officer needs assistance here. Hurry, man, hurry. Yeah. Cop shit in his pants! Cop shit his pants! Shit his pants! Whoo! Yeah! Cop shit his pants! Cop shit his pants! Cop shit his pants! He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop. He shit his pants. The cop shit his pants! It's nice. It's slightly run-down and needs a little paint. It's nice. It's old. I like that. - Hello. How are you? - I'll be with you in a moment. Needs a buffing machine in the kitchen. That's the first thing I'd do. You've painted it and taken care of the silverware. Now all we need's a way to buy it. It's still for sale. Charlie, you've stopped even looking for a job. Listen, uh... after next week, I might make a real score. I might not need a job. Is Paulie part of it? No. - Really? - Yeah, Paulie's part of it. Hi. Uh, I hope you're not here to see Linwood. - He's gone for the day. - He's not here? No, we just came up to have lunch. Would you tell Linwood that we stopped by? Mm-hm. Beaujolais? Beaujolais. Beaujolais? - Yes. - Beaujolais. A full bottle. He's just got you fired. Maybe he's trying to make it up to me. When are you gonna outgrow him, Charlie? Outgrow him? Diane, maybe WASPs outgrow people. Italians, they outgrow clothes, not people. Hey, Nicky tells me you bought a horse. - Who Nicky? - Nicky the Nose. He says you bought a racehorse. Well, not a whole horse, Pop. There's three of us. Now, look, listen, Paulie. You're 28 years old. Your mother's not doing you no favor by bringing manicot' over twice a week by washing your laundry. I mean, Rockefellers own racehorses. Big-shot mafiosos own racehorses. Waiters don't own racehorses, Paulie. You went on the street for the money? To Nappy. I took five large off him. - How much did he bang you for? - 200 a week in juice. You got no gripe there, but what are you gonna do if you can't make these payments? Pop, you should see this horse. She runs in a couple of weeks. This horse is gonna make money, Pop. In my bones, I feel it. Paulie, look, God forbid, I don't wish you any hard luck, but listen to me... I don't think you're gonna see even a little piece of baccala for this deal, you know? Hey, Pop, it's better you don't smoke. Jesus Christ, I'm surrounded! You know, Paulie, I should have been a lot tougher with you. My brothers whack their kids a lot more. They're better off. Nicky the Nose is better off? He's got a house in Staten Island. Pop, the Nose is my first cousin, but he's a total asshole. Yeah? He trades in an Olds 98 every year. Pop, the Nose ain't even Napulitan', for Christ's sake. It's his mother's side all the way. Genoese. He don't go for spit. The Nose shines his own shoes, Pop. That's no big success. So what do you call success, huh? Knowing how to spend it. I never ordered a brandy in my life wasn't Cordon Bleu. I took 500 from Shylocks, Pop, to see Sinatra at the Garden. Sat two seats away from Tony Bennett. That's success, Pop. Where is this interview you're going to tonight? Uh, it's around. You're not going to an interview. No. You don't even bother to lie to me carefully anymore. It's an insult to be lied to so obviously. Diane, I'll tell you what... tomorrow I'm gonna turn over a new leaf, and I promise you, my lies will be better. - Okay? - Okay. - Come on. Let's dance. - We can't dance to that. No, we can dance. Vinnie, can we have some music? You got it, Charlie. It's closing time In this nowhere cafe There's no way in the world I'm gonna let that girl Let her slip away Don't go. Don't go where? Wherever you're going. How can you tell me not to go if you don't know where I'm going, huh? It's a mistake, Charlie. You're making a mistake. This is it. What do you guys think? - What do you think? - What do you mean, what do we think? Top floor's a tough spot. We gotta go by that like cats. - Cats. - Wait here. What do you think, Charlie? - I think he's a fucking mope. - Fucking mope. But he's careful. You know, he seems to be prepared. Prepared, yeah. What do you think? I think he's prepared. Absolutely. No, what do you think? What do I think? Of what? An alley? Come on. Okay, let's move it. Come on. - What is this for? What is this for? - Don't worry about it. Make 'em look light and walk into the place like we own the joint. What the hell is in these, Barney? Tools, nice Genoa salami, a couple of Thermoses of coffee. - He's got an appetite. - Come on, Paulie, just walk. Three hours in there, you'll be starved. I'm busting my balls, really. Okay, you take this. Ma, do I have a clean T-shirt? Yeah, it's on the kitchen chair someplace. You know, uh... Trusty Dream? It's a four-year-old filly. No. She's in the third at Aqueduct. Six furlongs. One-eleven in her last time out. She must be a nice little place bet. I like this horse. Want me to put your game show on, Ma? Nah, leave it alone. I can't even think with those assholes jumping up and down and screaming. Do I have a clean handkerchief, Ma? It's in the drawer. I like your haircut, sonny. Glad I talked you into it. At least go to the filters, huh, Ma? And those highballs, they ain't doing you any good either. A little whisky is good for the system. And it's not the cigarettes that give me the heart attack. It's 37 years... scrubbing floors on my hands and knees for those rich sons-of-bitches on Park Avenue. Do you remember hauling garbage after dinner every night of your life? Pulling on dumbwaiter ropes? I know. Your right arm is bigger. Yeah, twice as big as my left. Pulling dumbwaiter ropes up five-storey buildings. Look, it'll protect you from the muggers when I'm gone. Aw, Ma, one more year. One more year, Ma, and I'll have my 20 in, and we'll head to Phoenix. Clean air, sunshine. I'll even teach you to play a little golf. With that dumbwaiter arm of yours, you'll drive the ball a mile. And what will you do, Walter? Liquor store. Big house, hacienda style. And I'm even gonna have a little dumbwaiter put in just to keep that arm of yours in shape. And all this on a second-class detective's pension? I got a little put away, Ma. That what your little recorder's for? Keep track of your savings? It's just a little personal protection, Ma. In case things go sour. I mean, this little box... well, it gives me a hand to play with, you know what I mean? If things go sour, Walter... I got nobody left. I know, Ma. Oh, get outta here. Come on. Lock the door, huh? Yeah, yeah. Go on. No, no, no. On your stomach. I look down, I'll freeze here for a fucking week, man. Oh. - Come on. - I don't work this high without a net. - It's your idea, this whole thing. - Oh, God. All right, Charlie. - Go ahead. - Why me, man? Why you? You're the monkey. You go. Go. Hold me, Charlie. Hold me, man. It's a tin can all dressed up. Good for fires. Got a couple of broads tucked in here, Barney? Cover the front, huh, Paulie? Cover the front. Barney. - It must be the phone. - Paulie, give me a break, all right? Give me a fucking break. Barney, what is that? Could be anything. - Could be a wrong number. - Absolutely. There'll be 150 large there. Make your usual pick-up in your usual place. That's all that counts now. That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant. It's September 21st. 11:25 PM. Heading for my monthly pick-up on West Street. From there to Queens Village to deliver the money to Inspector Ed Burns, whose voice will be on this tape later on. Hope to be erasing this in Phoenix in about a year. Did you ever see those big S&M fags? They go into old buildings like this. Charlie, that's somebody's personal paper you're reading there, man. Big mothers, too. All dressed in leather and shit. These S&M fags get so carried away, they beat each other up and whatnot... Will you please shut your mouth? You're starting to sound like half a fag. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, man, somebody's coming! Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming. Somebody's coming. Get out of sight. Grab the cases, fast! Come on, Paulie. - How many? - One guy. - Cop? - No, no, just a guy. One of the bosses probably forgot something. If he comes in here, let me handle it. - We'll bluff our way through. - Charlie, I gotta take a leak, man. Shh. Be quiet. Oh, fuck. The rope ladder. Freeze! Freeze or I'll blow you away! Shit. - Oh, man. - Barney, he's not moving. What are we standing here for? Let's get the hell outta here, Charlie. If he's breathing, our best bet is to get outta here fast and call an ambulance, crawl out from under a murder rap. Murder rap?! Nobody came within 20 feet of that yo-yo. He dived into that hole like a fucking gopher! If somebody dies during a crime, it's murder, end of story. Barney, it's a dead cop down there.
