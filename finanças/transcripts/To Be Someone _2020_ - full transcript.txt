Who was at the door? It's Albert, he wants dad. Well, there's a surprise. So you enjoyed the school holidays? Yeah. It's been great. We've been to the zoo. The beach a few times, and stayed at nanny's, and made cakes and done lots of nice things. You're going up into seniors when you get back aren't you? Yes. Looking forward to it? No. I had to get shit loads of homework. What'd you say? Dad? Albert wants you. Does he? What does he want? Dad said, what d'you want? Tell him to turn it down a bit. Wants you to turn it down a bit. Does he now? You tell him... Daddy said "bollocks." Hey, I was listening to that. So was half the street. Put on something that we all like. Do you want another coffee? Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you. What time the boys coming round? They are coming around... Shit, I'm already late. You have been getting ready for the past three hours. Yeah, well, I'm Danny the Face. I gotta look good at me own club, no? Don't get too pissed. You know what you're like when you've had a few... 90 I'm going to see a new band. I might even be back early. Well, I might wait up for you then. Maybe I won't go then. Go on. Life ain't too shabby at the moment. You know, when I was younger, I always thought I was gonna be like a footballer or a music star or a nightclub owner like the old man. Childhood dreams, eh? Fact of the matter is, everyone in this world wants to be a somebody. But most of us are nobodies. I reckon there are two types of nobodies. Prodders like the road sweep. Jammy bastards that can do no wrong. You know, the sort that if they fell into a bucket of shit, they'd come out smelling like roses. And then the unlucky sods like me. I promise you, if I fell into a bucket of tits, I'd come out sucking me thumb. Home now. There is a glimmer of hope for a nobody. I mean, you can keep living a life of mundane shit if you like, or you can fight. You can pull yourself out of defecation. Grab, strike, steal, beg, borrow. Just get yourself up to the top of the tree because that's where the somebodies are. I hear you're getting out tomorrow, Nick. You lucky bastard. What you talking about lucky? How old are you, son? - Eighteen. - Fuck! You know... You was a baby the first time I stepped in here. Yeah, I'm a lucky bastard, ain't I? Good luck, Nick, don't get caught next time. Fuck you. Double 20. - Bullseye. - Boss. You made me miss my shot. Get in front of that dartboard! Which eye do you want to lose first? Boss, It's Nick. Ginger Nick's out. Is that, right? Well, you better take Baldy Bollocks here and go and get him then, wouldn't ya? Hey, you owe me a tenner I won that last game. Bollocks. He put me off. You go and you bring that little muck back here. Now piss off! All right, bob. Oi, you! - Morning, Albert. - You and your bloody music. If that's what you call it, might crack down my wall. Albert, I play my music once a week on a Friday at eight o'clock, I think you can waive it. And that gang of ruffians you hang around with on bikes, their engine vibrations made my ass upside. Look, Danny, hey, just take a look at yourself. The way you're dressed, your bloody bike. You're not a teenager anymore. Why can't you just grow up and be more like... What? Well, like me. Albert, if growing up means being a miserable old git like you. I think I'll stay as I am. Thanks. Ta-da. You, dickhead. What's happening Ken? - What up, boss? - How's it going, Dan? - All right mate. - I ain't seen you in ages. What brings you down here? Scooter was running a little bit lumpy, innit? You're gonna have a look it for me, would ya? Yeah, no problem. Do you want a cuppa? We'll catch up. Yeah, okay, yeah. I'll sort it out then. It's probably just a dirty plug. - Cheers, Steve. - All right. How's Tommy and Bunny then, Ken? Still up to their old tricks. She pops her head in occasionally. Well, what I wouldn't give to spend a night with her. I'll show her a thing or two. Oh, Bunny? She'll eat you alive, mate. They behave themselves upstairs? I ain't saying nothing. They are not here again today? I'll pop me head in and check then, shall I? Well, if you ain't back in four hours, I'll send the troops in. You're about to meet Tommy. Tommy's my dad's old best mate. Tommy lives with Bunny. The pair of them are your real sex, drugs, rock and roll types. And they... And years ago they turned their passion into a business. They've never looked back. Hello, Dan-O. It's a bit early, innit? I just got out of bed. A bit early? It's half ten in the morning, you lazy git! Who's that? - Who? - "Who?" Her, with legs up to her armpits. Oh, well, well, that was Sarah. She's... Bunny's... She's having a bit of boyfriend trouble. You let me in there? Yeah. Oh, golden fannies, Tommy, what's going on here? ...speaking, how can I help you? What... Mum, what are you doing here? Calm down, son. I've just been doing a bit part time on the phones. And I've been doing it for ages. Anyway, what's it got to do to you? Dan, it's not how it looks. Let me explain. Please don't tell me you're running a knocking shop out of my gaff. Ah, Dan, this is Daniella. - Oh, you are now? - Pour a drink? No. Funny enough, Tommy, a knocking shop contravenes my lease agreement on this place. I gave you a good price 'cause I though you wanted somewhere to live. It's no big deal, Danny. There's nothing dodgy going on here? Full service, yes. We're just using this place as a base. I've started this visiting massage agency, it's Tommy's Tickles, and, uh... Well, the girls and the drivers just chill out here waiting for a job. Tommy, Anal Arnie wants a word with you on the phone. He's got a complaint about one of the girls we sent him. She shat on his satin sheets. Look, give me ten minutes, erm... Why don't you give Daniella a game of pool? You won't win, but, er, I think you might enjoy yourself. Arnie, how are ya? Now, don't worry just send me the laundry bill. We each break, or shall I toss for it? No, no, you can play. You know what? I concede. - What? - Let's, um, do something else. Do you do anything else other than pool? I sing a bit. Go on then.

That place still works. Look I mean it. Hmm. How about you? Is there any money in that traveling masseuse business? 'Course there is. We were making a fortune until Mike got involved. Not Mad Mike. How on Earth did you get involved with him? Well, he found out we were doing well. Then he forced us to move coke through the girls to their clients. Oh. For God's sake. I didn't have a choice. Mike sucked us in. Oh, yeah. He was all nice at the start. He offered protection to the girls, and he even gave his credit on the first few batches. Oh, yeah? And then what? Quantities got bigger and bigger. He forced the gear on us, and... I got into debt when a deal went wrong and... - Now he's a partner. - A partner? Oh, my days, Tom! you really are stupid, you know that? I am lucky to be alive. And I don't think you can sit there and lecture me with your history. - My history? - You work with his son. Oh leave off. Vinny's nothing like him, you know that. They're chalk and cheese, they don't even get on. Right. Here we go. One of the UK's most feared crime families, go by name of the Warrens. They're headed up by three brothers. The good: Old Jack. A very odd, but fair bloke. When it came to a business deal, he was ruthless. But he always looked after his own. Loyalty means everything to him. Then there's the bad: Mad Mike. Mad Mike, he starts chucking. I've seen him beat the shit out of someone, then for good measure, pull their arms out of their socket. He's one nasty bastard. He's got a son, Vinny, who helps me manage the Punch Bowl, my night club. He's a stand-up bloke, and he wants nothing to do with his old man's gangster shit. Eh? Piss off! And then there's the ugly: Stan. Do another blow. He was one party animal. New pills on the market. They are like blues with a buzz. They're called buzz bombs. Help yourself, girls. Mm-mm. Buzz bombs were the latest craze then. Sort of like what ecstasy is today. But back then, it was new territory. Some of the batch were taint. Stan died that day along with the girls. Old Jack was devastated at his brother's death. Mad Mike didn't seem to give a toss. Just said, at least he died happy. Old Jack and Young Vinny never forgave Mike for that comment. In fact, they both despised him. Why? Mad Mike was the dealer. Back in the day, my old man spent most of his time behind bars. It all started with a three-year stretch for drug dealing. Truth be told, all my dad was doing was flogging his own personal stash. So he could get rid of it, and make a clean start. The bloke he's talking to is Jack Warren. Remember the good? He was the daddy of the prison. Dad was lucky they both come from the same manner, and Jack took him under his wing. So... So, Dan, hear you'll be leaving us soon. A couple of weeks I'll be out of here. No more dealing, eh, Dan? I've never dealt gear in my life, Jack. Wrong place wrong time was a stitch up. Good. Glad to hear it. Jack! Remember the nobodies? - Sarko ends up dead. - Fuck! Old Jack spends a few days in hospital, and dad gets another five years for manslaughter.

And nothing's going to take that feeling away. ♪ Sarajevo ♪ Sarajevo ♪ And these all out wars War, war, war I feel it coming ♪ Sarajevo ♪ Sarajevo ♪ And these all out wars War, war, war I feel it coming Look at him, he loves it. Young Danny's doing well. - Yeah. - Maybe too well. What do you mean? I don't know. I can't put my finger on it. Your old man is taking a lot of interest in young Danny lately, and you know what he's like. Something wicked this way comes, you mark my words. No, no, we'll deal with that. Our Roger is a fixer. To you, that means, he could pretty much take a piece of shit and turn into gold if he wanted to. Big night tonight Dan. - Happy? - Yeah. This was a shitty little boozer when your old man bought it. - Look at it now. - Yeah. Thanks to the great fire of London, eh? Cheers. Cheers. To the great fire of London. Good day, fellas. Roger hired dad as a partner back in the day. Roger then convinced the old man that he needed to... expand, refurbish the place. Bring it up to speed, if you will, Now what dad didn't realize was, in order to expand the place, Roger was gonna burn it down first. Well, what's the insurance for, Danny? - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers, boys. Well, up in the North of the country, in Scotland... Oh, God. Hello, Nick. It's been a while. Somebody wants a little chat with you. Get dressed. Now! Wake up. Nick, it's been a long time. Yeah, a fucking lifetime. Thanks to you, Mike. Thanks for coming up and visit. Well, I'm a busy man. Oh, and thanks for the monthly checks to my family. Well, I would have looked after them when you were inside. That is, if you told me where the stash was. But you didn't, did you? Because, oh, no. Nicky boy, he's got a fucking conscience. You know as well as I know, if I would have said anything to you before I got released, you would have had me ironed out. And why would I do that, Nick? Because fucking 15 years is a long time, Mike. And you thought I'd flip sooner or later. So I had to get some life insurance. So fuck you! Na, na, na, na. Don't get cheeky, because you'll only make things worse. Worse? I lost my wife. My kids. Don't fucking laugh at me. Half my fucking life thanks to you. Spare me the violin dramatics, all right? Now the police... They only picked up half that stash. So I've got one pertinent question for you, Nicky boy. Where's my fucking gear? It was bad fucking shit, Mike. Them blues was killing people. - Kids! - Is that right? Yeah. it was right, you sick bastard. One bad pill. Well, if the kids don't like them, they shouldn't play Russian roulette then, should they? Like I said before, the old blue only recovered half of that stash. So somewhere out there, floating around is five million buzz bombs unaccounted for. That's a lot of fucking money, son. You do the maths. That's one, two, three, four, five. Five million buzz bombs at five pound a ton I would say. Don't you ever fucking listen? It was killing people! Where is my £25 million of buzz bombs you fucking shite? Eh? Where are they? Wake up! Nutters, get me me saw. I'm gonna chop his arm off. Would say, like, electric or manual? What did I use the last time? Uh, petrol chain saw. Petrol? Ah, na, na, na. You gotta think about environment, greenhouse gases. Give me the manual. What one first, Nicky boy? - Your wanking arm? - Whoa, whoa! Hold up. All right. Okay, okay, okay. - Okay. - Eh... We're getting somewhere now, aren't we? Do you know where my gear is? Yes. Well, it's easy then, innit? You go and you get me my gear and I don't chop your fucking arm. I can't. Can't means won't, won't means can't. I can't! Have a look out the window. There should be a silver Ford. It's Old Bill, they've been watching me like a hawk. He's right, boss. There's two of them in it. They've been on me ever since I've got out. I'll tell you where your shit is, but I ain't gonna get it. They followed you? Eh? You've brought the Old Bill onto me, and I can't even kill you now. I tell you what, you've spoiled my night. I'll tell you something, Mike. If anything happens to me, I've left a letter that tells all, I swear.

I would be scared doing what you're doing. There are some weird punters out there, Linda, I'm telling you. Tell her about the burper. Oh, God, he's a weirdo. - Made my skin crawl. - Who? This geezer, right. He pays good money. I mean, top dollar. Thing is, he's a right pervert. But it's money for our rope, really. He gets you to drink a bottle of Coke as fast as you can, right? Then, all he wants you to do is stand in front of him burping while he tosses himself off. Okay! You are winding me up. Hey, what about that bloke from Hemel? Bollock chops. I couldn't believe it when Daniella told me, so I went with her last week to witness it for myself. Who's a bad boy then? I am. I'm a bad, bad boy. And what happens to bad boys? Punishment. Thank you so much. Jesus, and he pays for that? I couldn't think of anything worse than a good kick to the nuts. Well, mind you, I felt like doing it to Danny a few times. Oh, I can imagine. He could be a right little prick sometimes. Oh, yeah? What's this then? We were just talking about bollock chops. Now did Bunny tell you what happened on Monday night? I was short of drivers, I asked Ken take Daniella to an appointment. - Oh, listen to this. - Go on. Daniella walks out to the car, and says to Ken, "Do you wanna earn an easy 200 quid?" Ken being the pervy git that he is says... So what you want me to do then? Nothing much. All he wants is you to watch me give him a blowjob. - Yeah? - Yeah. Really? I'll give him £200 for that. That ain't bad for 200 quid. The trouble was, while Daniella was busy blowing him off, the dirty git wanted Ken to tickle his nuts. It's still not the end of the world for me. With his tongue. That was so bad! I gotta ask, did he do it? I'm not saying. ♪ Got a feelin' you've explained it ♪ Baby, tell me ♪ Got a feelin' you've explained it... Yeah. Bring that muck Danny in, I want a word.

You don't even see eye-to-eye with your old man, do you? Can't stand the psychopathic bastard. And he knows it. That's why I let Roger deal with him. Ah, you know, I've got a bad feeling about this. I've never had any dealings with your old man. - What's he want me now for? - You know, mate, I don't know, all right? He just said he wants a word with ya. That's it. Okay? Relax.

Lost all me stash. - Yeah. - Well, Nicky here is gonna tell me where it's hidden. What's that got to do with me? But we have a problem. And a problem shared is a problem halved. You see, Nick would gladly go and get it for me. But since he's got out, he's got, what can only be described as a permanent fucking shadow. Can't even have a fucking wank without the Old Bill knowing about it. So you're gonna go and get it for me instead, Danny. At my bollocks. Why can't you get it? Shut your mouth. Why can't you? Silly bollocks, Ginger Nick had brought the Old Bill on us that's why? Well, that's your problem. I ain't getting involved with drugs, Mike. Oh, yes, you are. You owe me. How'd you work that out?

I suppose that's why you're never in the same place for more than ten seconds. He wants your head on a plate. Let me explain that. Back in the '80s, Tommy and Bunny, they run this old mansion brothel in the country. Very discreet. Very successful. Money came pouring in and Tommy got greedy. Coke was the big thing then, and Tommy decided to cut out the middleman and do the deals himself. As you can imagine, business was booming. Rudi and Tommy were mates and totally trusted each other, all was going well until... Fill it up, mate. Rudi then gone and ripped off some nutty Irish firm for 20 grand a week before. So they of course returned the favor. Let's go. Bad news is, Rudi got the gear on account from, you know who. Hardly a sensible move, and he's meant to be the brains of the operation. Well, I'll chop off your arms, and gouge out your eyes. Do you get my toby? Give you a toby. And Tommy took a cash loan from the Yardies. Yeah, you heard me. The Yardies. Which meant Tommy had no choice but to pay up. - You're a dead man! - Or else? You hear, right? You hear right? So what does he do? Out of desperation, he asked Roger the Fix to torch the mansion for the insurance. The thing is, the insurance refused to pay on the grounds of FOA. Fucking Obvious Arson. Tommy lost everything. He had to go on his toes. Now he's constantly looking over his shoulder for the Yardies. As is Rudi from Mad Mike. What if I told you there was a way we could stitch up Mad Mike and the Yardies, all in the same evening? All right. I'm in. Where do you want me to fiddle? You all right? Yeah, getting there. When we gonna talk about all this? I don't know. Let me... Let me get a bit of head space I gonna go to the pub have a couple of drinks and then... we'll talk about it properly later, yeah? - All right? - Okay. Yeah? See you later. Danny! How's it going, Boss? Hiya, Steve. All good, mate. What's up, mate, you look down. Nah, nothing. I've just got a lot on me mind. Sorry, Steve. Yeah, cheer up. You doing the Isle of Wight this year Dan? The whole club's going. Right, innit? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course I am. You're a genius. Steve. Listen, I'll see you soon. Yeah, I was happy to see you. So why are you so jumpy? I'm jumpy, Tommy, because we've got problems. We've got Mad Mike. We've got the Yardies, and we got bent coppers. And I think we have to get rid of them. Get 'em off our backs for good. Agreed? Look, I hate to say it, but I think we need to use the dodgy pills. I think we need to stitch them up to the Old Bill. Listening. Okay. Obviously, the Old Bill is gonna have eyes on the Isle of Wight. I mean, Ginger Nick's out, right? - Good point. - I think I've got a way to get those pills off the island. We use the scooters. Are you serious? - Yes. - With scooters? Scooters, yes, we need six of them. We'll get all the pills off the island. - Oh, yeah? - Yes. Because we're gonna be surrounded by 100 more - that look exactly the same. - Oh come off it! I was trying to think who the other four were gonna be, now you're talking about hundreds. Hear him out, old man. August bank holiday is the Isle of Wight's scooter rally, right? So when that ferry docks on the Monday morning, about 100 scooters pull off together on the hour. Ya, man, that sound good. That can work. Okay. Okay. So we got the pills off the island. What next? Next, I organize a drop for Mike and Dickson. - Who's Dickson? - Dickson's the bent copper. Every policeman named Dickson. Look, Rudi, all I need from you is to get the Yardies to the same drop-off point on the same day. Can you do that? Yeah, I can do that. Well, then what are we talking about here, boys? We can get rid of Mad Mike. We can get rid of the Yardies, we can get rid of the bent coppers. The dodgy fucking pills. In one night! This is my family we're talking about, eh? Okay, sorry, it sounds like a good plan. But how do we get away? Fuck... I don't know. I don't know. Hey, plan cool, man. We just need to iron out a few things, that's all. Yes, I'd in. The plan cool. Rudi... I've gotta ask you know. You've lived in London your whole life, yeah? Yeah. Why are you talking in that Jamaican accent? Well, what do you think? It's my persona, innit? Alter ego. Besides which, them Yardies are looking for a bald cockney. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet, sweet. All right, be lucky, son. That was Danny on the phone. He's going for that thing. Yeah, you know, he's a nice boy that Danny. I used to know his old man. And I know his old girl. Do you trust him? Yeah. If he mucks up, I'll just kill his fucking whole family and him. Okay. But we'll keep an eye on him. Have you seen that Thunderbirds? Thunderbirds. Thunderbirds. You know, "Thunderbirds are go." See that part there? Do you reckon that part was game that Lady Penelope won. I'll tell you what I'll give her mine. She isn't right. Well, she's a puppet, boy. Yeah, I know, but I'd still stick me hand right up the back of her. Now... I want you all to know that although it goes against all my immoral fiber to break the gangster code, I think Vinny will bear me out when I say I'd rather grass him up for his own good than have someone kill him. Simple as that. Yeah, and listen. I know it is a lot of risk, and I know it is a lot to ask of y'all. I do. But I'm desperate. And you're the only people I can trust here, so... Thank you. I'll do it for a pint of lager and the buzz, mate. Yeah, but it's the right thing to do, right? I mean bad pills. Nah, I'm in all the way Don't need to ask me, Dan. Besides, that rally would be full of crumpet. You animal. No, but seriously though, lads, not a word to anyone yeah? Not even your other halves, because if Mike finds out, we are gone. Listen, Vinny's right. Mike's got ears everywhere. So you're gonna go through with this? I've got to, ain't I? No, you don't have to, Danny. Yeah, I do. Trust me, I know about the threat that Mad Mike made about the family. - How? - Because girls talk. Bunny told me - What? - You should have told me for God's sake, Danny. I didn't wanna worry you, did I? I was worried. I don't wanna be down there getting it done while you're up here worrying about me. No, I won't be, because me and the girls have decided that we're coming with you. What? Right. For me, that was that. There was no way I was putting the mother of my children in harm's way. I had to put me foot down, be a man about it. We argued about it for two days. I lost. Right up there Ken. Uh, yeah, yeah. They're up in Tommy's flat right here. Nothing like the smell of leather eh, Ken? It's not the leather, Daniella's been on it. I gave her a lift around the block the other day. You're a dirty bastard, do you know that? Phew. Right. We're gonna try and keep this simple and to the point. You got any questions, save them to the end, ya? Yeah. Friday morning, we're all gonna get on our scooters. The plan is to head for the Rockingham Cafe and mingle with all the scooter clubs down there going to the rally. There's gonna be hundreds of them, all headed for the Isle of Wight. Sort of natural camouflage, if you will. If we're being followed by the Old Bill or even Mad Mike's mob, we'll be impossible to pick up. Yeah well they might not be able to pick you two and Sharp Steve out. But what about the rest of us? I mean, you're the only Mods here, but we don't even look like Mods. I mean, look at Ken here, I mean, he looks like a pillock. Oh, yeah...

Old Bill were in the front freezing their bollocks off. I'm sorry you got involved in all this Dan. Shit happens, eh. Hm. Dan, this is the map. That's where the pills are stashed. It's called Oakdene House. It's an old manor house that's been empty for years. "Spooky" is an understatement, And you're sure the gear's still gonna be there, yeah? Yeah, still there, all right, Dan? When it all went tits up, I booked it in before I got nicked. Right... Where will I find the gear? In the crypt. Under the tunnels, behind a tomb. In the crypt, behind the tomb. What is this? Fucking Scooby-Doo? Well, that's all part of it, mate. The locals won't go anywhere near it because of the ghost of Father Morley. I tell ya, whenever I was down there, I used to shit meself. Right. Look, just follow the map and it'll all be okay. Look at it like it's an adventure. You'd be like the geezer Indiana Jones.

Listen, the most important job of all, make sure you get Mad Mike at the drop off point, yeah? He'll be there. All right, let's get this show on the road, shall we? What is that? I've got me a bit of vintage. I told you, mate. These old bikes they're a pile of shit. Fuck off! I think I've blown a gasket here. Then what you're gonna take now? - Benny! - Yeah. Fetch me my Royal Alloy. Sure thing, Dan. Ah, Rudi has arrived. But he won't come in. There's no smoking. Oh, good. This would be swell. I'm too stoned for this bike shit. So I thought I'd drive down. If any of the girls get tired, they can come with me. Yeah, I'm sure. Come here.

Just gotta find my Mr. Right. I never had the urge, to be honest. Tommy never wanted them. We're too busy partying. Besides, Tommy said a whorehouse isn't the right place to raise kids. - Ah! Hello, love. - Hello, mum. Right, I thought we'd have these bits and go over the plan here, yeah? So what's the crack Dan? I think I'll take Ken, Rudi in the car, go and look for this Oakdene house. Oh, we're just gonna stay here and watch a film on this. As long as it's not a Bond movie. I really feel they spoil the integrity of the story when they use mindless product placement. Do you fancy a drink, Dan? Girls? What are you two doing here? Crow here, he's going undercover. Just to keep an eye on our interests. Just think of me as your Guardian Angel. I want you to remember something, Danny. You don't deliver, you're going down. You got me? Got it. Come on then. Have a nice day, boys. Enjoy. We've got to search this place in the dark? No, it's not in the house. Thank God for that. Place gives me the shits even in the daytime. Yeah, well, it's in the tomb behind the crypts. Are you serious? - It would be a laugh. - A laugh? I can't wait. There's someone standing on the roof. - Oh, bollocks. - I'm serious. He's holding something in his hands. Fuck it. I'm outta here. He's got to lay off them joint cigarettes, don't he? No, I'm telling you. Rudi said he saw the ghost of Oakdene House. Did you say Oakdene House? I got a story to tell you. About 300 years ago. There used to be this nut house on the island, run by a priest called Father Morley. It was called Oakdene House. This will be good. Father Morley and the staff there were into black magic and all this devil worship shit. They say they used to cut off the nutters' heads and offer them up to Satan. He's gotta be pissed, don't he? At the end of the ceremony, he would hold the heads up for all to see as a warning. That's exactly what Rudi said he saw. - A man holding heads in his hands. - Oh, come on, Steve. This is the biggest load of bollocks you've ever heard. I heard he buggers you as well. Does he? Right, you'd better go on, mate. See you out. Grab a beer, go on. Shouldn't be listening to other people's conversations anyway, Piss off, you monkey twat. That was so naughty. Well, hang on a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Right, listen. Have a drink, Have a laugh. Don't get too drunk. Seriously. Gotta go and get the gear yet. Er, Ken you're the designated driver, all right? Thanks a lot, boss. Daniella, get me some orange juice. Put Worcestershire sauce in it. He's good olives that Steve. Yes, if he were a bowl of chocolate, he'd eat himself. Do you have the time, Ken? Yeah, we should get going. Where's Rudi? He's waiting in the car. All right. ♪ Bosh ♪ Bosh ♪ She went Bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh, bosh ♪ Bosh ♪ Let's go bosh ♪ Let's go bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh Bosh, it's nonstop. ♪ Bosh ♪ Bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh ♪ Bosh, bosh, bosh Fucking love that tune, play it again. Right. We're here. - Have any of you got a crowbar? - Yes, mate. What's the crowbar for? Barring crows. We're smashing our way into the tomb where the gear is. Look, you know, don't mess, right? Look, this tomb shit, right? It was supposed to be in the house, wasn't it? I don't like the sound of all this shit, Dan man. You ain't supposed to disturb the dead. There might be zombies. Oh, shit. Crowbar. Right. We all fit. - See? - Yeah. We're gonna go into that graveyard, we're gonna find a big family tomb, okay? And we're gonna get in there, get the gear, get out. Done. Tombs... Ah shit 'em! Come on, let's have it. - Can I come? - Who said that? - I did. - Jesus. What the fuck is he doing here again? Couldn't help but overhear your conversation at the camp. Piss off, you nosy bastard. What you lankers could do with a guide. I know this place like the back of me hand. Sod it. I don't even care. Let him come. Come on, let's go. Okay. Let's get up to there. Well, perfect, look, we've got a full moon lads. I've got a bad vibe about this. Dan, I thought you said this place was empty. It is. Then who's the geezer on the roof I'd just seen? See? I told you. I swear down, he was stood there near that chimney, and he was holding on to something. It's the heads. Look, let's forget about the whole thing. Let's just get out of here. Oh, don't be so daft. It's probably just some old tramp who's living there. Yeah, it's hardly gonna be the ghost of Father Morley, is it? Come on, lads. I think it's over here. This is a bit like being in a horror film. And what always happens? I'll tell you what happens. One by one, they all get bumped off. And that's what's gonna happen to us. I think I'm beginning to sober up. This is gotta be it, lads. Right, watch your backs. Wait. Nothing there. Let's go. No, no, no, wait a minute, Look, there's a ladder, look. All right, who's first? Don't look at me. Sharp Steve? Bollocks. You go first. Alright, sure. What's wrong? I thought I saw a bat. It's a spider. Tarantula. Hold this, give us a leg up, will you? What a shithole. I found it. Well, come on then, grab a couple of bags, we go. I'll second that. Here, I'll pass them up. - Did you hear that? - What? Hear what? There was like a moaning noise. What's that? Come on, let's go. Look, I know I'm pissed... ...but did that really happen? Yeah. I think it did. Can we go on? Dark side. It was D-day, time to hatch the plan. My gut feeling was that it would all go tits up, but I had no choice. For the sake of all concerned, it had to be done. It's all the pills in the van, mate. You should probably get off, yeah? I want to come with you. We all want to come with you. Be safe. Now don't get me wrong. This plan could all still go pear-shaped... I'd arranged for Mike to be at the drop-off in person. Not the easiest task, believe me. Crow. How long does it take you to have a piss? - I'm not having a piss. - You what? Ah, he's having a pony. Where the hell is he? What am I doing here? My balls are numb, and I'm gonna disembowel that little schlag when he gets here. You're the only one he trusts and respects. Really? Did he say that? Ah! How sweet. He's a nice boy, that Danny. Good boy. Good boy. Rudi has to do the same with the Yardies. If things don't work out, I'm gonna chop you up to pieces. Take him with. Which I'm sure had equal complications. You need to pray this work for you, Rudi. Right. So the plan is to get everyone in the same place at the same time, hand over the pills and let them fight it out. Then the Old Bills should turn up and everyone should get nicked. While Vinny and I make our cunning escape. Where you going, you little piggies? - Vinny? - Hmm. I'm starting to think this plan might be well and truly flawed, mate. Well, we've done our bit. That's it. Right. Crow, go and check the drugs are okay. Yes, boss. What's the scooter for then? For going home. What do you think? Who said you're going home? You promised us a safe passage back. Come on, Dad. We had a deal. Hang on a minute. I never promised you fuck all. In fact, I might blow your fucking head off! - Hey! - Fuck's sake! - Hey. - You got what you want why don't you let them go? Do not tell me what to fucking do. - D-d... did you dig the hole? - Yes, Boss. - Did you fucking dig it? - Yes. Well, say your prayers, 'cause everyone's going in the fucking hole. What's that? Who the fuck's that? I told you to stay out of it. And I told you that we're all in this together. We're family. What you gonna do now, Mike, kill us all? I might do. I might do. Yeah, dig a bigger hole, 'cause they're going in it and all. Who the fucking hell was that? You gave us your word, Mike. My word means jackshit. Sorry, Danny, mate. Everything screwed up. What you on about, you muck? Listen, Mr. Mike, all we want is what belongs to us. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, you're gonna see what I got, Mr. Bumba Claat. My fucking pills. Who the fucking hell is that now? Right, you're all nicked. Fuck off into grass. Who's the grass? Fuck off coppers. I don't get it. Oh, it's quite simple, really. I was undercover. Deep undercover. And you lot, you're going away for a very, very long time.

For his own good, of course, so he kept it to himself. In return for not blowing his cover, Dickson turned a blind eye to Jack's criminal activities. And that was that.
