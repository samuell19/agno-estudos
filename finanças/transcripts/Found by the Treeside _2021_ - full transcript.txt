They say we have all the time in the world This I presume to be a lie Time is put a mean to a lonely end They said once more a love in love will last for eternity Now that I imagine is the truth [Music] But what can truth truly be without a lie A lie bestows meaning upon an honesty, the truth found by the tree side Once more they told us to hold on once more they begged us to remain strong for those of whom we love Never forget they said Think one more minute then one more hour, one more day and thus it continues Never forget they begged once more a love in love found by the tree side [Music] - Fucking, got problems with the battery, it's low - Oh my god, I am so, so sorry - It's my fault too though - No, no, no It's mine.

No, I'd love to walk with you. - Yeah, like are we good to go? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure [music] [Music] Dear Cassandra, I've met a boy He's very special. Every day we meet each other to go for a walk and once one of us walks the other home. We don't talk again until the next day [Music] It's almost like our connection is completely personal, completely private [Music] We don't text, we don't call but every single day he's waiting outside my door When we are together it's almost like the whole world stands still. I'm walking and he's with me and in that moment I'm in complete harmony For the last seven months it has been my favorite part of the day. He makes me feel euphoric. - Charlie, I've got something for you - You do? - Yeah. Close your eyes Close your eyes [Music] Open your eyes - What is it? - It's a triangle. People say that shows us the path where our potential place is, it's straightforward, by other words it takes back to you - I don't know what to say. - Don't say anything, just wear it - Can you...? - Yeah [Music] - Thank I think... - Oh, I know [Music] - Thank you for today - No problem I'll see you tomorrow - Oh, do you want your jacket? - No, keep it [Music] - Just now I feel why would I do that to you, dad? - I don't know who told you, but it's not true I didn't kiss any boy, dad I've learned my lesson after the last time, I promise Dad don't... no please... because I started a lot better in this apartment please don't make me come home dad, yes sorry...

We went to school together He was my best friend. One day we were in the backyard when he started to...to... act different - Different? - Yeah. He started holding my hand like and I liked it...a lot and out of nowhere he kissed me. - Oh! - But my father saw it, he then went home and... he... hurted me...a lot. - Hurted you? - My father loves baseball, he has... a steel baseball bat and...well... - Oh my god! - I know I didn't tell it before because our time together it was...ours. It shouldn't be affected by my past, but now... - And now what Mark? - He knows, someone told him - Who? How? - I don't know, maybe some neighbours but it doesn't matter. He's making me leave, Charlie - What? I mean can you not stay?
