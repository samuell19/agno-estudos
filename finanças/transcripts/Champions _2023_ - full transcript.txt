Tight game here halfway through the fourth quarter... two points. Need a defensive stop. Carlson cuts to the middle. Pick-and-roll, alley-oop, slam dunk. Wow. What a play. That was easy. Beautiful pass... halfway through the fourth quarter... two points. Need a defensive stop. Carlson cuts to the middle. Pick-and-roll, alley-oop, slam dunk. - Wow. What a play. That was easy. Beautiful pass from Carlson to Carriere. Do you know that you don't have any soap in your bathroom? Oh, yeah, I got to pick some up. Do you want me to... call you an Uber? No, I'm good. Lyft? No, I drove myself. I'm on my way out. Ah. You-you need something? Just these. Oh. Oh, you like basketball? It's my job. I'm a coach. Oh, really? What, high school? Professional. In Des Moines? Iowa Stallions, J League. J League? Wow. So only like four or five big promotions and you're all the way up in the B League. That's good. Truth be told, I should be coaching in the NBA. Then why aren't you? Because there's a lot of, uh, politics involved and... Well, don't worry, darling. I... I will be soon enough. "Darlin'"? Okay. Hey. That was fun. I, uh... I think you're a great gal. - What? - Nothing. You just... you seem to think that I need some hand-holding here, and I'm good. This is not my first time swiping right. Apparently. Oh, no. Did I hurt your feelings? I'm trying to be a nice guy here. -You are? Why are you being such an asshole? You're focused on SportsCenter, calling me "darling," - and yet I'm the a... - It's not SportsCenter. I have a big game tonight. I should've known I was in for a real meeting of the minds when I saw you only had one book in your apartment. I actually have many books. They're in storage. I-I tend to travel light. And it's called Visualize Success. - Powerful stuff. - Hey. Don't knock visualization. - That stuff works. - Yeah? Did you visualize this? No, I, uh, I visualized you leaving a lot earlier. - Did you hear that? - Wow, what a zinger. All right, guys, keep it moving! Let's go! Get it down! Get it down there! You got to make that! Ross, rotate! Rotate! Hey, remind me why our leading scorer's on the bench. Get your man! Come on! Move the ball! All right, now, ge... Timmy, box him out! Keep it moving! Defense! That's his second turnover. How many times you gonna turn the ball over before we sit his ass down? Move! - Uh, put Derrick in for Moran. - Post up! He doesn't listen to me. Are we trying to lose this game? I don't believe so. Trap! Trap! Trap! Why are we doubling on the perimeter? They're passing out of it, killing us three-on-two. I want them to figure out how to defend the three on two. Yeah, well, they're not... Rotate, damn it! - Defense! - Marcus. - Defense! - Have a seat. Defense! Defense! Rotate! Defense! Defense! Time-out! Time-out! Time-out! Okay, guys. Bring it in. Bring it in. Come on. Don't forget, Friday night is Kids' Night. We're running side-out-down. Inbound to Mike. Timmy sets the screen. Jared, go in for the slam dunk. - Okay? - No, not okay. - What? - That's a terrible call, Phil. Marcus, it's my team. You're my assistant. But I-I can get us a better shot. I know how they defend this situation. I watched it this morning. We still inbound to Mike. Derrick, we're gonna run the split action with you. Marcus. Marcus! Go to the locker room. And let you blow this possession? Hell no. We inbound... -Okay, okay. That's it. That's it. Get off the court. Go on. Get off the court. Okay, I'm going. All right. Okay, come on. We got a game to win, all right? You know, Jalen, we don't show a lot of J League highlights on this show. Maybe we should. It's the gateway to the NBA. It's full of freak athletes making great plays. Yes, sir. They got some springy dudes down there. Remember Marcus Marakovich? Great young coach. Took Abilene Christian to the Elite Eight. I remember. Then he got the Ohio State job. Right. And then he lost the Ohio State job for losing it on one of his players. He bounced around internationally for a while. Now he's an assistant coach for the Iowa Stallions. Now, he didn't like what the head coach drew up, and, look, he goes all WWE on his boss. - Uh... - No. Uh-oh. Want me to turn it off? Mm, no. Turn it up. After all that nonsense, there's still six seconds of basketball to be played, and this is where we want to see the team rally around a coach, execute the play, buzzer beater. Instead... Oh! Get that shot out of here! You had me going, SVP. I thought this story had a nice ending. That wasn't nice. No, the block was nice, but right now, no, nothing but bad news for the Iowa Stallions and Marcus Marakovich. Turn it off. See? I told him that play was horseshit. ♪ Whiskey River, take my mind... ♪ Yo, Marcus. You made SportsCenter. That's pretty cool. What an idiot. You're an idiot. Relax. Take a chill pill. I saw you. Poor bastards. Hey, thanks, man! Ah, shit. Marakovich? Let's go. You posted. Huh. You were the last person I expected to see, Phil. We go back too far, Marcus. You know what a meme is? You're a meme now. My granddaughter sent this to me. She's been sharing with all her little friends. Finish him! Oh. At least it's pretty funny. No. It's not. It's not funny. All right. Okay. I-I messed up, obviously, and I... I'm sorry. - You don't sound sorry. - Well, I am sorry. I mean, I'm not entirely sorry. I mean, should I apologize for wanting to win a basketball game? By knocking me on my ass? Look, I... I'm frustrated because you never listen to me. I told you that lob play was dumb. If you'd have run the split action with Derrick... Do you know why I didn't run the play with Derrick? A misdirection maybe, but at least use him as a decoy and... His grandmother is in the hospital. She had a stroke. Mm. Okay. Well, I mean, she's old, right? It shouldn't matter, Marcus! The woman raised him. Look, he was upset. His head wasn't in the game. But you wouldn't know that because you don't bother to get to know any of the guys. What do you mean? I know the guys. I-I know Jinky can't go to his left, Balanko is strictly catch and shoot... As people! Human beings. Look, Marcus, you know the game better than anybody I have ever played or coached with, but... you got to learn to build relationships, man. Okay. That-that is so adorable. What, are we living in Hoosiers now, and I should go home and work on my inspirational locker room speeches? You were a prick in college, and you haven't changed. That's why you never stick anywhere. Ohio State. Greece. Turkey. Oh, now, Turkey, that was strictly a language barrier issue. You literally kicked a player in his behind, bruised his coccyx. And he spoke English. The kid was from Detroit. I get your point, okay? I'm gonna take the time, and I'm gonna cultivate relationships... -No. No. - No, I'll get to... - Marcus. You're fired. It came down from the front office. McGURK: Marcus Marakovich? Uh, Marakovich. Attorney Charlie McGurk. I'm gonna be representing you. Oh, good. So am I in a lot of trouble? Not with me in your corner you're not. - Okay? You relax. I do ten of these DUI cases a day, Mr. Marakovich. This is gonna be quick and hopefully painless. Okay? You let me do my thing. We get you out of here with a fine and... Fist me! What? The judge. We got Mary Menendez. "Hanging Mary." "Hanging Mary"? She's the toughest judge in Des Moines. She's a real stickler. And she does not like drunk drivers. Oh, son of a bitch. Whoa, whoa. No boo-boo words. Okay? There's no swearing of any kind in Menendez's courtroom. Just let me do the talking, okay? Unless you're addressed directly by the judge, - don't say a word. - Okay. And try to look pathetic. Yeah, there you go. That's perfect. Can you fake a limp? I'm not doing that. Okay, I'm gonna ask you this, and I need you to be honest. Are you drunk right now? No, I'm not drunk. Okay, good, 'cause I've had several. One of us needs to be straight. Get your game face on. Driving with a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit, damaging a police vehicle, resisting arrest. No. Uh, I just, uh, asked for their badge numbers. I didn't resist. Ow! I told you to let me do the talking. You just smacked me. I'm just telling the truth. - Dickweed. - Boo-boo word. Mr. Marakovich, would you like me to add contempt of court to the list? Because it seems to me you have enough charges as is. No, Judge, that's plenty. It's "Your Honor." Your Honor. Sorry. I'm gonna make you an offer, Mr. Marakovich. Now, I understand you are a professional basketball coach. Is that correct? - Uh, yes, Your Honor. - Okay. In light of that information, I will offer you community service: coaching at a local rec center. Community service? I... No, I can't... Uh, a moment to confer, Your Honor. -Yes. Just shut up, you lucky son of a bitch. I'm not feeling lucky. She said community service. - That's the ju... - But community service? I need to be in other cities wh-where I'm gonna be working. I can't stay in Des Moines. I-I can't take community service. Oh. You can't take community service? Okay. So, uh, with that in mind, then... you are hereby sentenced to serve 18 months incarceration in prison. Time to be served at... Uh, uh, I-I-I do apologize, uh, Your Honor. I think there's some kind of misapprehension here because we were talking about... I said... -Hmm? We both were talking when you said, "Take community service." I don't... I don't want to take comm... I want to give to the community. I want to give freely. I'm all ears. Wh-What did you have in mind? Good decision, Mr. Marakovich. As I was saying, I will offer you 90 days' community service, coaching adults with intellectual disabilities at The Friends Association in Capitol East. Um, Your Honor? Uh, when you say "intellectual disabilities," what are we talking here? - Uh... - Yes? - Are we talking retar... - Oh. Ded Americans? Because, y-you know, it seems kind of redundant that, you know, in a sense, Americans, we are re... You know, we're-we're those... I-I'm talking about myself, too, you know? I'm a... Your Honor, I just have to state for the record, I literally just met "What's His Pickle" here 20 minutes ago. Okay? I don't think his words should reflect on me going forward, future hearings. No, I-I just... I-I want to say the right thing, but I don't know... If I can't say the "R" word, what-what do I, uh, call them? May I suggest you call them by their names? That's, uh... that's very astute, Your Honor. Come on. Gentlemen! Can you come this way? Okay. Right. Yeah, come on up. Okay, fellas, my name is Marcus Marakovich, and I am going to be your basketball coach for the next three months. Nope. Wait. What? I said, "Nope." Is this something he normally does? Nope. That's Darius. He's our best player. I'm Johnny. I'm your homey with an extra chromey. Whoa. I love animals. My sister's an actress. My dog's name is Peaches. Johnny, that-that is one funky musk you got going there, brother. What do you say we end this hug right about now? Okay. Wow. Whew. Okay. My eyes are watering. Let's, uh, let's take a knee. Coach, I didn't know we'd be kneeling, so I didn't wear my knee pads, and I'm worried about my patella. Your patella? Okay, well, you can stand. - Thanks. - That's Marlon. He speaks Mandarin Chinese. Huh. That's Benny. He works in the best restaurant in town. -O-Okay. Uh, there's plenty of time to get acquainted later, Johnny, but for now, let's everybody, uh, partner up. Uh, Coach? I don't need a partner. I've got a girlfriend. Wonderful. Actually, I got two. No, you don't. It's the same girl. She just changes her hair. And she knows how to get around. Oh, now, now. Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy. So what? Why can't she have a lot of boyfriends? I've got two girlfriends. No, you don't. They're best friends. They live in a group home. I'm gonna live there, too. Okay, Johnny. Um... I'll tell you what. Let's everybody stand up. We're gonna do a little drill. Uh, you guys, uh, Snap, Crackle and Pop... Snap, Crackle and Pop! That's not their names! Yeah, I'm Craig. This is Cody. - I'm Blair. - Okay. Craig, Cody, Blair, we're going to do a simple ball-handling exercise. Uh, my girlfriend loves those. Oh, my God. Can you just forget your girlfriend for a minute? You can play with her later. We don't play. We have sex. I go to her place, and we do it. - All the sex moves. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Watch, Coach. Big balls. Yeah. What's that guy's deal? - Showtime? He's a specialist. - A specialist? Yeah, he's the only player in the league who shoots backwards from half court, and he's on our team. Pretty good shot, huh, Coach? No, that's a terrible shot. Now, that's a good shot. Looking good there, Darius. Nope. I'm not playing for you. This is impossible. Hey, don't worry about it. You'll have them all done before you know it. No, no, I-I'm talking about the team. It-It's impossible to coach these guys. You know, impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Please don't quote cat posters to me. Look, Marcus, they're Special Olympics athletes. You don't have to turn them into the Lakers. They just need to feel like a team. You know, I snuck a couple peeks in there today. It looks like you were doing good. Doing good? I-I didn't coach any basketball. I was mostly hearing about Craig's girlfriend. Uh-huh. Huh. I hear he has two. Well, it's not clear. You know, the one guy who can actually play won't play for me. Yeah, Darius. Ah, you know what? I... I don't, I don't care. I-I just... By the way, what-what happened to the guy who was coaching before me? Oh, we don't talk about him. They kill him? No. No, no. He quit before the season was over. The team was very upset. Right. But we won't have that problem with you because we've got you for 90 days. Guaranteed. Yeah. 90 days. Very psyched. ♪ Sometimes I miss a step ♪ ♪ I stumble here and there ♪ ♪ I'm finding my way home ♪ ♪ If I'm lost... ♪ Hi, Coach! Johnny, right? Do you have a guinea pig? No. I do. Do you want a ride? Who's driving? Not your guinea pig, I hope. Honeybun can't drive. Come on. All right. Thanks for the lift. Kind of chilly out there. I'm freezing my balls off. This is my sister, Alex. She's my best friend. Ah. Well, nice to meet you, Al... Oh! - What's the matter? - What's the matter? No, n-nothing. No. No, I-it's... she... Your, uh... she... Sh-She looks a lot like someone I used to know. Do I? Huh. Well... It's very nice to meet you for the first time, Coach. Yeah. Marcus. Marcus. Wow, that's really a nice name, Marcus. Hey, listen, Marcus, you coach The Friends? - Is that what I'm hearing? - Uh, yep. Yep, I, uh... Kind of a funny story, really. Yeah? Tell me. Yeah, well, I mean, it's... It's not "ha ha" funny. It's not even... It's not funny. It didn't seem like it was going anywhere funny. Coach, do you want to do carpool karaoke with us? Uh, no. You know what? I-I don't like carpool kara...

And I've been working my, uh, connections, but it occurs to me that your uncle is one of the most respected GMs in basketball. And is it possible you could talk to him and help me out? Absolutely. Yeah? - Yeah. - Oh. But I don't want it to be, you know, minor league. - I-I want it to be the NBA. - Yeah. You know, fifth assistant, uh, player development, whatever it is, NBA. Gotcha. I'm on it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I knew it. I knew it. - You're the man. - You're the man. - No, you're the man. - No. Sir, you are the man. All right, I am the man. You're right. Hey, you know what? After I talk to my uncle, we should go out. Hit the clurb. Get crunk. Get crazy. And I'll give you the update. Listen. I got an idea. Text me. Lunch, then. Okay, guys, today we're gonna work on the fundamentals of passing. Arthur, come over here, help me out. All right? Now, we're gonna start with the bounce pass. You ready? Okay, you see that? Thumbs behind the ball, flick of the wrist, bounce pass. Right? Got it? Okay, throw it back to me, Arthur. Good. Good. Now we're going to do the chest pass. Same thing, no bounce. Got it? Nice. Hey, Coach, your shoe's untied. Made you look. Oh, that's very funny. Yeah. Arthur, what the hell? Sorry, Coach. Uh, wasn't I supposed to toss it back to you? Yeah, but the guy has to be ready. That's a crucial part of this... - Uh... Oh, all right. Uh, hang on. You guys, uh, shoot around a little bit. I'll be right back. - Ball, ball, ball. - Kenny. How you doing, buddy? How's everything going in, uh, Seattle? Yeah? Oh... Hey! What the hell?! Yeah, no, I'm okay. I'll call you right back. Guys, what are you doing? Shooting around. - Big balls. - What am I looking at here? Big balls celebration, like when an NBA player hits a big shot. Big balls. Oh, but you got to hit the shot, right? I mean, you don't celebrate a miss. Showtime does. He knows all the celebrations. He's a student of the game. Aha. Watch this. Do shimmies. Steph Curry. Look at that. Aha. That is outstanding. Hey, uh... has he ever actually hit one of those backward shots? In the five years I've played with him, he's never even hit the rim, but he's due. - Huh. - Mm-hmm. Huh, pretty impressive. Hey. Sounded like you guys were having fun - out there today, huh? - Yeah. Yeah. Well, Arthur gave me a concussion, but, uh, yeah, other than that, pretty fun. Oh. Well, we don't have any insurance, so I never heard that. Bye, Julio. See you Thursday, Coach. Okay, Benny. You be good. Please tell me he's not gonna ride that thing. Well, sure. I mean, he lives all the way across town, so he comes back and forth on that scooter every day. I mean, he's gonna kill himself. All that ice. Well, as far as I know, he's never had a single accident. Uh, can you say the same? Touché. These guys are capable of a lot more than you think. You'd be surprised. Like Benny, for instance. He lives on his own. And he wakes up at 5:00 a.m. every morning and works in a restaurant in the kitchen. Now, Blair is not as self-sufficient. I mean, he lives in a supervised group home with some of the other guys. And every morning, he goes to a gardening workshop. ♪ I-I-I-I wanna run the world, I-I-I-I... ♪ I mean, they all live pretty full lives. -Hmm.

Bye, Julio. Bye. You be good tonight. Now, Johnny, uh, works at an animal shelter. I mean, he loves animals, all animals. I guess that explains that zoo-like aroma. Yeah. He also refuses to shower. - So there's that. - Oh. Good evening, Coach. Thank you so much for everything. -Mm. Buenas noches, señor Julio. Hasta pronto. Hasta mañana. Arrivederci. Uh, sayonara. Does he actually speak Spanish? Yeah. He speaks four languages. Oh. - Oh, dear. The 2:45 flight from O'Hare to Portland is late. How the hell does he know that? That-That's not normal. There must be some chaos up there. Hey, Coach, check out these handles. Ah. Now that's some musical basketball right there. Rockin'. Be good. What's his story? Well, Craig, he works in a vocational school. He's a welder. He's such a good welder that the new students just hang out and watch him work. He calls them his groupies.

Everybody, listen up. The first thing we want... Guys, I thought I told you to wear blue. I look better in red. But it is a home game, and home games, we wear blue. My girlfriend is here, and she likes me in red. I'm sure your girlfriend would like you just as much in blue. She'd say, "Oh, my God. Look how handsome Craig looks in blue." She isn't that corny, man. She's into nasty stuff. Yeah, she is. O-Okay, have a seat. Guys, here's the deal. If you're not wearing blue, you're not playing. I suffer from color blindness, so I don't really know what I'm wearing. Well, luckily, Marlon, you're wearing blue, so you're fine. Uh... Hold it. Where's Benny? He couldn't make it. He had to work. He had to work on game day? Yeah, his boss is-is a r... is a r... is a r... a... A real asshole. Okay, no Benny. I guess we'll have to make do with what we have. There we go. There we go! Beautiful!

Coaching The Friends. No, I... No comment. This-this will only take a moment. -Nope. Nope. Nope. Okay. Everybody, hold the balls. Hold the balls. Everybody, get over there. Get over there. All right. Guys, today, I am going to teach you the most beautiful play in basketball. It's called the "pick-and-roll." I love this play. And when it is done right, it gives me a hard-on. What the hell? Oh, sorry, Cody. It-It's just the truth. Will it give me a hard-on? Well, if you're lucky, Marlon. Okay. Now, Blair, you come defend me. Johnny, you're on my team. Benny, you're defending Johnny. Okay? Now, what happens is I start to come to the right, toward you, Johnny. You step up and set a pick on Blair. Where do I set it? You set it right here at his elbow. Good. Good. Good. Oh. Oh. My God, you have got to take a shower. Everyone says that. Yeah, and everyone's right. I mean, I'm tearing. Okay, you setting the pick? Okay. Do you have a pick? No, you are the pick. Be-be like a statue. Good. And now I start to come this way. They both have to come out, and that gives you a chance to roll, Johnny. Roll? -Yeah. You-you move toward the basket. - Move toward the basket. - But I'm a statue. - Statues don't move. - Forget I said "statue." I can't. Okay. There you have it, the pick-and-roll. Did it give you a hard-on, Coach? No, Marlon. In fact, I think my dick just evaporated. That sounds serious. Hmm. Yeah, it is. Hey, did you tell your boss we got that road game in Ames? Yes, but I have a doubt. What doubt? I think he'll say yes, but I have this doubt. - What doubt? - This doubt. Okay. Okay. Fine. Uh, if you have any more doubts, come talk to me, all right? Hey, Johnny. Jump in the shower. I don't believe in showers. - What does that mean? - He's afraid of the water. There's a rat! It's a rat! A rat! A rat! A rat! A rat! A rat! A rat! - There's a rat? - Okay, relax. Okay, let's check it out. I didn't know we had a rat. - Huh? - A rat. Since when did we have rats? I hope it's all right. Oh. - That's not a rat. - It's just a little mouse. Save it, Coach. It's gonna drown. Save it! All right, all right, all right. Just relax. Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not gonna drown. It's all right. Oh, no. We got to do something. - Where'd it go?! - Down the drain. It gonna drown down there, for real. During drowning, your lungs fill with water, you can't get proper oxygen, and then... Not now, Wikipedia. Save him, Coach. Save him! All right. Oh, no. He's... Oh, you know what, Johnny? You got to save him. You're the animal expert, and he will sense that, and he will come to you. - You got to do it, Johnny. - Come on. You got this. - Come on, Johnny. - You got this. -Come on. - That's it, Johnny. - Come on, Johnny. - You can do it, Johnny. - Johnny, y-you get... No, no, Johnny, you got to, you got to get in there, and you got to look down. You got to be able to look down, so get under there. Can you see? Cutie, come out. Johnny, you know what? Here. You got to wash off. If you don't wash off, the mouse can smell it, and you got to smell good. He'll smell that you're clean, and then he'll come to you. Get under the pitters. Under the pitters. That's good. Great. Take a run at that undercarriage. There you go. Yeah. But don't overdo it. All right. That's good. Yeah. Great, Johnny. Cutie, I'm clean.

You saved him! - He's free! - You freed the mouse! - How's that feel? - It feels pretty good. Yeah? Give me a hug, Coach. I already had... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Come on. Yeah. Yay! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Johnny! Well, first road game, huh? - This is exciting. - Yeah. Look, the bus stop is right over there. Takes you right into the heart of Ames. Hold on. We... Public bus? What are you expecting, a limo? - Are you coming with me? - No. I can't look after these guys all by myself. Marcus, relax. You'll be just fine. Oh. Oh. Good news. I forgot something. You're getting a player off the injured list to replace Darius. Cosentino. Hell of a ballplayer, Cosentino. All right. Happy luck. - Hey. - Hey. So, Johnny. Look at you, all fresh and clean. I put baby powder on my armpits and feet. Great. Okay. Uh... Hold it. Where's Benny? He had to work. He texted me. Again? Yep. Okay, so I guess we're just waiting on this Cosentino. Cosentino had a Grade 2 ankle sprain. Just came back off from the injured reserve for kicking ass. Kicking ass. I like that. No, literally, kicked some guy in the ass. Huh. - There she is. - Cosentino!

It's fascinating. It started in Paris in 1662. Johnny, come back here with us. He can't hear you. He's got his headphones on. Did you hear? Johnny's gonna move in with us. Yeah, I heard something about that, Blair. I'll get his attention. Oh. Oh, no, no! Ah! Projectile! Oh, no. Whoa! That was not your smoothest stop. Who is in charge of these guys?! Oh, that'd be me. Uh, I'm their coach. If you're trying to get us all nauseous, good job. They are being disruptive. I got hit in the head with something. I got one guy talking my ear off.

She's an actress. She does Shakespeare. Huh. All right. Let's go. Welcome, weary travelers. How cool is this van? Ah, what do you say, guys? Better than the bus, right? Yeah. That bus smelled like puke. Hey, uh, thank you for picking us up. Don't thank me. Thank my brother. I'm doing it for him. He seems to think you're a really terrific guy. Doesn't exactly track for me, but... Well, I think he's a terrific guy. I do hear you got him to take a shower. That's very much appreciated. Wh-What's going on with that? I never heard of anyone afraid of a shower. He's afraid of water. He... He almost drowned in a swimming pool when we were kids. It was... Long story. Oh. Oh. Oh, is that how he, uh, got... You know, got the... How he got Down syndrome? No, you don't catch it from water. - It's genetic. - Sorry. I... I'm just... I'm-I'm just... I'm new to all this, so... Yeah, I can tell. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, I hear you hoodlums got kicked off the bus. Yeah, but Coach stuck up for us. Mm-hmm. Really? The driver was an asshole, right? Big-time. Oh, he was one of your people. Oh, I'm surprised you guys couldn't have worked something out. No, we did work something out.

I pay you to work, not run around in little shorts. Go. Go. Get to work. Dribble the dishes. Try that. Coach, how are we gonna get to our next away game? Because I don't think the bus is a good option. Agreed. What if we just play the home games? If we don't play the away games, it's a forfeit, and a forfeit is considered a loss. That's half our season. We won't qualify for North American regionals. Regionals are in Winnipeg this year. Hey, that's up in Canada. It's international travel, bro.

I'm just gonna run him home, and then I'll be back, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Bye, Coach. - Ah. - Great game. Great game. - Hey. - Great job today. - Okay. -Oh, yeah. - Way to go. - Yeah. -All right. - Good night. Sweet dreams. - You, too. Love you. Hey, uh... Are you gonna murder me right now? Let me break this down for you, Coach. I'm a woman in my 40s. I don't have time for bullshit, all right? Do you know what I do during the weekday? - No. - I perform Shakespeare for middle school kids right after lunch. Um, do you know what middle school kids want to be doing right after lunch? No. It ain't Shakespeare. It's exhausting, but it's acting, and I love acting. So, after that, I go home and I do a lot of freelance bookkeeping because Shakespeare... And brace yourself here, this might blow your mind... Doesn't pay so much. And then I go pick up Johnny from work, and we spend the whole afternoon together. And I love him very much, but it's exhausting. And then I make dinner with my mom, and then I watch Doctor Who with Johnny, and if I have any energy left at the end of the night, sometimes I hop on Tinder, okay? 'Cause a woman's got needs. Oh, yeah. Well, no doubt. And you might be a big, giant pain in my ass, but as far as I remember, you were... passable in bed. Uh, uh, passable, like passing the bar or passing a kidney stone? You got the job done. It... You were fine, right? And sometimes, that's all a woman can ask for, okay? Mm. Mm. Mm. You are singing my praises. So the bottom line is: Are we doing this or what? Consider me swiped off my feet. Great. Buckle up. All right, now, listen up, Showtime. You see how my shoulders are facing the basket, - my sternum facing the basket. - Yeah. Yeah? Squared up, and then I shoot. - I'll try it. - You'll do it? - Yeah. - Come on. Okay, already you're doing great. - You're facing the basket. That's good. Now... - Oh, hey, Darius. - Nope. Big balls. Big balls, huh? Friends, let's go. Go. Yeah. Nice, Craig. Fire it up, Craig. Craig. Yeah, yeah. Fire it up. Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Nice, Cody! Not bad. Pick-and-roll, Johnny. Good. Set the screen. Good. Now roll! Roll! Roll! What are you doing? You're supposed to roll. I'm a statue. Statues don't move. Right. Then the dead queen's best friend shows the king a statue of Hermione, and she says, "'Tis time. Descend. Be stone no more." And that statue comes to life. - Really? - Yes! And she starts moving, and then she steps down from her pedestal. Yeah, Craig, bring it down. Pick-and-roll, Johnny. Statue! Okay, now roll, Johnny! Roll! 'Tis time! Descend! Be stone no more, Hermione! Roll, Hermione! Roll! Yeah! That's it. Yes! - Yeah! - Beautiful! You see that?! Now, that's the pick-and-roll, baby. Did it give you an erection, Coach? I'm rock hard, Marlon. Good. I'll explain that later. Uh, defense! Defense! I can't wait. Yeah, that's it. Yeah! What? Are you time-outing me? Can I ask you a question? Right now? - Yes. Um... - Oh. I just... I was wondering, you and I... Oh, God. - No, wait. - What are you doing? Don't make it hard. I just want to ask you... Oh. This is so cute. What do you want to know about us? Where-Where-Where's this relationship going? Hey, hey. It-It's just sex. It's okay. Just sex after away games. Very convenient. You good with that? Yeah. I mean, you're not planning on sticking around Des Moines after your 90 days, are you? - No. - No. Well, then, it's a win-win, isn't it? Are you okay with that? Yeah, no, I can, I can learn to live with it, yeah. Okay. All right. Well, then, can we... game on? Definitely. What am I looking at here? Oh, pipes burst. I don't know. It must be global warming, huh? I mean, it's raining, and it's freezing, and it's snowing, then it's freezing again. And all of a sudden, it's hot girl summer in January. I tried to call everybody to warn them, but these guys showed up anyways. Look, you've been running them pretty good. Just take the day off, and I'll get this fixed. No, no. No days off.

But are we invited to play in the game? No invitation necessary. There's nobody waiting. You just say, "We got next." That means you're playing the next game. Shoot, shoot. Good one, guys. Okay. Benny, do the honors. Say it loud. We got next! Nice. - See you later. - Let's run it back. - Have a good one. - Take it easy. Hey. Did you hear my man? We got next. Yeah, but we're running it back.

They fired me, remember? Oh, yeah. They did. What's going on? Well, I was just wondering, are they still underutilizing your talents here? I'm still catching farts, if that answers your question. Well, um... do you have any time on Tuesdays and Thursday? Yeah. Sometimes. I could use an assistant. With The Friends? Really? Yeah, you know, uh, you know, I run these, uh... different exercises with them, and, uh, when I split them into two groups, it just goes off the rails, so... I-I could use some help.

Uh, thank you so much for everything. This has been fabulous. You're welcome. And there you go, driving another boyfriend away. - He's not my boyfriend. - He came to dinner. First man you've invited home in years... - Johnny invited him. - Johnny invited him. You're sleeping together, you two. - Oh, my God, Mom. - Don't deny it. You're having sex. - I can tell. - Okay. Peaches can tell, for crying out loud. All right. You and Coach are doing sex moves? Okay. Bye. Hey. Wh-What are you doing? Uh... waiting on an Uber. Come on, are you just gonna run away? No. Well, yeah. I mean... I just wasn't feeling terribly welcome. Hey, by the way, I love your mom. She's very colorful. Okay. Why'd you come here tonight? Meat loaf Mondays. You invited me. I didn't invite you. Johnny did. Okay. Seriously? I mean, come on. What are we doing here? You don't want me to come to your house. We got to sneak off under the bleachers to steal a kiss. Like, you know, we're not in junior high. Wh-What... What's... what is the big secret? I-I don't know. Look, I-I... I like to keep my personal life and my family life separate, okay? I just know from experience that if I get involved with a guy, you know, and Johnny finds out about it, then he gets attached. And if it doesn't work out, then he can get very hurt, and I... I won't do that to him. Okay. You ever think maybe... you're hiding behind Johnny? I don't think we should see each other anymore. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, okay. - Okay. There you go. That's it. Move those feet. That's what we're gonna work on today. Good job. Good job! I have Down syndrome. I'm not deaf. Got it, slick? Got it. Cool, cool. Yeah. I'm gonna be with the rest of the guys. Hey, Eeyore. What's the matter, girlfriend problems? I-I don't have a girlfriend. Makes sense. Oh, what, am I that bad-looking? You're no McConaughey. Coach, I wrote down what I want to say to my boss. Is there any way that you can read it? Uh, yeah, I'll look at it later. Go on. Get... Johnny? Come here. Your sister and I are just friends. I'm not a child. I know what you're up to. Okay, okay. We... we were involved, but we're not anymore. Hey, hey, hey. I thought you wanted to go live with the three amigos. Why... why didn't you tell your sister? I want to go, but good guys don't leave. I was a kid and they made fun of me. Alex beat them up. She did. She beat them up. So I don't want to leave her. My dad left my mom after I was born, so I don't leave Mom either. Yeah. Well, anyway, just, uh, stop giving me the stink eye. Okay. You're still giving me the stink eye, Johnny. - I'm not. - You are. - Not! - You are. Ei-ei. Marcus. Ah. Hey, Phil. What are you doing here? Uh, food's good. Got to eat, right? How you doing? Doing all right? Ah, I'm hanging in. I read about you in the paper. The Friends. Oh, yeah. That's a... No, no, no, no. It's-it's great. How are you making out with Darius Rhodes over there? You know Darius? I coached him. Uh, ma'am? Can I get a cup of coffee? You coached Darius? Well, in a sense. He showed up at a youth camp when I was coaching here at Drake. Ten years old with a handle like Iverson and a smile that lit up the gym. I was thinking, "I might be recruiting this kid someday." The next summer, he's not at the camp. I find out he's been in a terrible car accident. Traumatic brain injury. - Brutal. - God. I get the job in Fresno, but I kept in touch with the family over the years. He won't play for me. Yeah? Huh. Is there any way... you could talk to him? No. It's got to be you. Yeah? Julio told me where you live. I got to go to work soon, so... Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just give me one second. Okay. I-I talked to your old coach, Perretti. Perretti's my guy. Yeah, well, he's my guy, too. We're friends, and... I know... why you don't want to play for me. I hate drunk drivers. Yeah, I get it. I-I mean, obviously, I don't get it, get it, but I, uh... you know, I-I get it. You still drink alcohol? Sometimes. Definitely not as much. You still drive drunk? Darius, you can choose to believe me or not, but I know for a fact that I will never, ever do that again. Never. Okay. You're not gonna ask me to play? Nope. I just wanted you to know that I know. And I get it. See you Saturday. Wait a minute. Congratulations are in order. What do you mean? We haven't won anything yet. No, but your 90 days are up. You're a free man, Marcus. Really? Huh. Ooh, boy. That flew by. Well, uh, okay, Julio. We'll see you Saturday. This is one big thing, and it's a good one. Jalen, you remember your boy Marcus Marakovich of the Iowa Stallions? The hothead assistant? That's the one, the jabroni who was throwing hands at his boss. Well, he got fired. "Jabroni"? Really? - No surprise there. - Smug-ass, alien-headed freak. But the surprising thing is that now he's the head coach of a juggernaut of a squad, a team of Special Olympics athletes called The Friends in Des Moines, Iowa. Now, check this out. As you can see, it's-it's cell phone video or something from somebody's phone, but it's fine. He's coaching his tail off. You know what? I respect the grind. I see you, Marcus. The Friends are just one win away from qualifying for the regional tournament. We hope you make it to the dance, Coach. We'll be watching. Yeah, you watch, Van Pelt. Let's go, Friends! Give the people what they want. Sir, I work very hard for you, and I deserve to have a say in my schedule. I love basketball. We have a big game on Saturday, and all I want is to play in that game. I can do better. I can do better. Sir, I work very hard for you. Hey, Coach. Hey. You made it. - Yeah, I made it. - Ah, great! Uh, so, uh, what did your jackass boss say to you when you stood up to him? He said, "You're fired." Oh. I'm... I'm-I'm sorry. Ah. It's okay. - Let's go. - Okay. Pass it down. That's the shot, baby! - Yes! Yes. - Oh. Okay, good defense.

If you come near me, I'll "Me Too" your ass. Okay. - It's players only. - Yeah, I heard. Hey. What's your problem? I don't want to play for Coach. You don't have to play for Coach. We play for each other. - Right? - That's right. -Yeah. - I agree with that, yes. - Nice one. And your sister is a grown woman who can have sex with whoever she wants, even a dogface like Coach. - You know about that? - Yeah. We all know. There was a vibe. You just didn't want to see it. We need you, so snap the fuck out of it. Oh, yes! Let's do this! Yes. I love it. Put me in, Coach. You're welcome. Okay. Yeah, let's go! Oh! Yeah! Whoa! Oh, yeah! Yeah! That's it! - Yes! -Yeah! - Yes! Not in my house. We did it! Yeah! - Going to Winnipeg! - Canada! Special Olympics! Canada. Canada. - Yeah. - Way to go, guys. All right. Shower up. I'll be in in a minute. - Good game. - Watch your head, Showtime. Good job, Sonny. Great coaching. Thanks, Coach. Hey. Oh. Hey. Congratulations. That was quite a game. - Thank you. - And you got Johnny to play. Uh, well, it wasn't me, but I'm glad he played. - We needed him. - Yeah. Yeah. So, uh... I-I'm sorry that I got all up into your business. -No. Don't apologize. I'm sorry. And I-I wanted you to know that I did hear what you were saying. Um... And it looks like someone wants to talk to you, so... Oh. We'll talk soon. Okay. Well, fancy seeing you here. Congrats on the win. Team looks good. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Uh... what's up? My mama's a Christian. She wants me to forgive the lady that hit me. I've tried, but I can't. But I thought maybe I could practice on you. So, I'll play for you, Coach, in regionals. Are you messing with me right now? Nope. I think... I think I might cry. Thank you. You made an old man happy. Go tell the guys. I'll be right in. Welcome to the team. Darius! Darius! Darius! Darius. Darius. Darius. Darius! Darius! Darius! Thank you. Yeah, Kenny. Hey. Yeah, I can talk. Just on my way to practice. O-Okay. Are you kidding me? You better not be kidding me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I-I'll call you in a minute. Okay. Uh, guys, listen. Before we roll the basketballs out, I-I want to try a little experiment, okay? Everybody, close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And... go inside your mind for a minute. It's very dark in here, Coach. That-That's okay, Marlon. That's fine. But I-I just want you to keep breathing, and I want you to use your imagination and visualize this. We are up in Winnipeg. Championship game has just ended. We are at center court, jumping up and down, celebrating. Streamers and confetti are falling, and the crowd is cheering us because we are champions! Okay, you can open your eyes now. Anybody see that? No. Winnipeg looked very cold, so I came here. I saw it, Coach. I did. - Nice, Benny. - Me, too. Ah. Great, Showtime. Okay, we're good, good. We'll just keep working on this because I want you guys to just, you know, get that picture in your mind because it's gonna happen. We're going to Winnipeg, and we're gonna be champions! Yeah! And I'm going to the NBA, to Seattle, because they hired me to coach up there! Seattle... sucks. Well, I-it's an expansion team. You know, it's a process. Well, who's gonna coach us next season, then? I-I don't know. Maybe Julio. Good guys don't leave! Yeah, Johnny, they do. When the NBA calls, they leave. I should've known. You know, it would've been really nice for you guys to just give me a little congratulations. C-Congrat... congrat... congr-gr-gratulations, Coach. We'll miss you. Thank you, Arthur. Hey. Hey. You're done early. Yeah, yeah. Uh, they, uh... Great news. Yeah, I, uh... got an NBA job in Seattle, third assistant. Which means, you know, I-I'll be on the bench, not one of those schmucks sitting in the second row. Yeah, it's a... pretty big deal. Wow. That's... that's great. Yeah. Did you tell The Friends? Yeah. Yeah. Uh... They weren't exactly thrilled, uh... as you might imagine, and, uh, Johnny, pissed at me, again. Hmm. Yeah. Of course he's upset. He's attached to you. They all are. Man, what does it take to get an "attaboy" around here? I'm sorry. Congratulations. I know it's what you wanted. Thank you. Really, I-I owe it all to The Friends. I, uh... Apparently, Seattle's getting roughed up in the press, needed a feel-good story, you know, to change the subject, and, uh... Look at me. Mr. Feel-Good. It's a little exploitative, though, isn't it? No. I'm not exploiting anybody. I'm... I would... I would never... You know that I love these guys. I mean, you were court ordered to care, so... It's not exactly the same. That's not fair. You... I thought we were okay. Why are you being so shitty about this? Honestly, 'cause you just get to drop into our lives and mess everything up and then just walk away. I seem to remember you telling me that you have no interest in getting involved. Yeah, I did, and then it changed. And you know it changed. Okay. I knew they changed for me. I didn't know they changed for you until just now. Happy to hear you acknowledge that. Yeah. I was never staying in Des Moines after my 90 days. You knew that. You know, you could have at least pretended it was gonna be hard to leave. You know, maybe you could've said you were gonna miss me. You're right. You're right. Well, I-I will miss you. Oh, good. Cool. Yeah. - I will. - It's too late. Okay, guys. I realize, after the last practice, there were some feelings about my leaving, but we still have a job to do in Winnipeg. Get over yourself, jackass. We can't go to the tournament anymore. What? Why not? We don't have the money. I appealed to the city, I appealed to the state, and nothing. The city sucks. The state sucks. Well, there's been budget cuts. Yeah, but, well, there's got to be a way, Julio. Uh, how much could it be? Well, it's in Canada, Marcus. That's airplane tickets, hotel rooms, uh, long johns. Uh, it adds up.

Well, I need you to put on a little show. See that? Damn, these costumes are great. Think we can pull this off? This is my basketball, Marcus. Just follow my lead. We're looking for O'Connolly. Okay. Right this way. I've got nothing to hide. I have no illegals working in my kitchen. Illegals? Really? Sorry. Mexicans. Oh, don't apologize to me. Apologize to my partner, Sanchez. -Hmm? Oh, sorry, Officer Sanchez. No problem... o. You have no idea how sorry you are. Do you know what's on here, Mr. O'Connolly? Uh, no. It's video and statements from your employees proving that you've created a hostile work environment. It demonstrates a pattern of abusive behavior, particularly towards a dishwasher named Benjamin Weaver. - Benny? - Yeah. A former employee with intellectual disabilities, thanks to whom you, Mr. O'Connolly, I'm assuming received quite a sizeable tax benefit. Well, hang on here a minute. Hang on my dick and balls, okay?! Here's what we could do. We could point Mr. Weaver to an attorney or we could introduce him to a reporter at The Beacon 'cause I just have this sense that it could be such a great story. Don't you agree, Sanchez? Sí. What are your thoughts on that? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, um... surely, uh... there must be something I can do. Hey, Coach, is there a pool? There better be a pool. Oh, I'm sure there's a pool, but, uh, this is not a ski resort, so why do you have the skis? Don't worry about it. Okay. Yeah! Is it everything you were hoping for, Marlon? It's even better than I expected! Whoo! Hey, hey, guys. Now, you had a big day. I know you're all tired, but tomorrow, we got the gold medal game, so I need you to go back to your room and get a good night's rest. - All right. - Sure thing, Coach. - We'll do it. - All right. - Good night. - All right. - Good night, Coach. - All right, good night. - Bye. - Good night. Look at you, laying down the law. They respect me. Whoo! Mush, mush, you filthy dogs! Whoo! Hey! That was rad. Coach. You have a minute? Oh. Sure. Great. Rolling? We've been following your incredible story for a minute now, Coach. You're on your way to the NBA, but first, some unfinished business. You're one win away from the Special Olympics North American Regional title. How's it feel? Great. Uh, I'm just really excited for my team, The Friends. Uh, you know, uh, to have the chance to become champions is a rare and special thing. Now, some are saying that the front office in Seattle is using your hiring as a distraction from the recent in-house scandals. I mean, do you feel that your team and their disabilities are being exploited? Uh, no, I wouldn't say that. I-I, uh... I feel that I am an NBA-caliber coach, and I will be an asset to them on... on the bench. - Thank you, Coach. - Mm. From Winnipeg, I'm Blake Lassiter, ESPN. Clear? Great. What the hell was that? I had to ask, Coach. I'm a journalist. You're a troll. Hey, guys. -ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Special Olympics North American Regional championship. -Hey. - What the heck? - Today's game features - The Beasts versus The Friends. - What's the problem? Why are you guys all looking so freaked out? Coach, the other team is called The Beasts! They're the "beasts," we're the "friends." Based on our names, I don't like our chances. - They're friggin' giants. - Aw, they're not that big. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. We have trained, we have practiced, we are in shape...

That's what it means to be a champion. Actually, the dictionary definition of "champion" is... Not now, Marlon. You can't be afraid to fail. You can't be afraid to lose. You can do it because I know you're brave. I've seen you. I've seen you do things that were hard. Things that felt impossible. And I'm not just talking as players. I'm talking as people. Benny... stood up to his boss, risked his job. That was brave. He's a champion. Darius. You were brave enough to give me a chance I probably didn't deserve. Champion. Cosentino. Hey, I don't know if you're brave or batshit crazy, but I know you're a champion. I was scared when I had my first three-way, but it was good. Yeah, okay. Champion.
