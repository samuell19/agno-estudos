Subbed and translated by kikki. (drunk talk) Are you from Tokyo, madam? Or? Is it a young lady? Nah nah not a young lady, that’s rude. Because your face looks as if you’ve tasted the bitter and the sweet, well experienced in the ways of the world. Sorry, this chap is drunk. Well, it’s a joyful occasion. I’m drinking with the money my son sent to me. He is in Tokyo. He works during the day, and goes to the night school. He sends me money every month. I’m so grateful!! I’m thinking of sending him to University, yes. His secondary school teacher also said that I should send him to University since he is such a smart boy! Oh? Madam, are you perhaps a University graduate? Right? A University graduate? See, I got it right! Right! Last year, my daughter started to attend a nursing school after graduating secondary school in Spring. At a part-time high school in Asahikawa. So that, to tell you the truth joyful occasion is that Hotaru moved to Asahikawa today. She is called Hotaru, Hotaru, my daughter. She commuted to her school in Asahikawa from home for a whole year last year. I’m amazed that she could do so. Every day and every night, ah! Because, what it means to commute to Asahikawa is that, you work at a hospital during the morning if you attend a part-time nursing high school. To do that, you have to get on the 6:02 train from Furano every single morning. Every single morning. I used to drive her to the station. 1988 Autumn The red leaves were so beautiful. Scriptwriter Sou Kumamoto Asahikawa Good morning. Hotaru! Yes? Tamara-San in room 3, it’s okay to serve her congee (rice soup) from today on, right? Yeah well… Good morning Good morning I’m gonna get anoscope disinfected, so please bring out more cover cloth. Yes, ma’am. It seems to be a lot of patients today. Right. You are here early, my dear employees! Good morning. My daughter is still in bed. Compared to that, you guys are great! You are hung-over again? Well, I drunk a little too much. Oh Hotaru, Yes? Your dad sent me a very good pumpkin, please send my thanks to him. Oh right. Will he come to the capping ceremony? I think he will. Well, then I might have a little chat with him then. Doctor, Miyazawa-san is waiting for you. Yeah, that’s right. Then Hotaru, please remove his trousers and ask him to lie on the bed. Yes. Right! Now! Now get cheerful and look at the bottoms today also, shall we? Hey Goro! Hey Spruce is here, wanna have a look? Yeah! How many in total? According to your plan, you’d need a little more than 100. Yeah But they aren’t dried yet. That’s fine. I still have plenty of time. But it’d be good if the skin comes off as soon as possible. By the way, How much would it be to in total? Goto-San, is he saying that he is gonna build it all by himself? Can he really do it all by himself? He says that he is gonna spend some year doing it bit by bit. Wow. Hey Yeah? There are three rooms on this plan, Are they meant to be for Jun and Hotaru? Hey Do you know? Hotaru is troubled for a while now The school has been telling her to live in the hospital in Asahikawa. In the first place, she finds it hard to let Goro-san drive her there and pick her up, right? But he likes doing that. Because he doesn’t want to be all alone, right? When Hotaru thinks about that, she finds it hard to tell, it must be. It’s arrived. I’m home, sorry I’m late. Sorry sorry I fell asleep Dad Dad! Yeah? Don’t sleep. Yeah, I’m ok. Hotaru, Yeah? Jun hasn’t got in touch, I wonder if he’ll come home for the New Year? He hasn’t come home in a year and half already. I’m sure he will come home this time. It seems that we can save some money from carrots this year, So maybe I can send some money to him. Is the water hot enough? Yeah, just right. When he comes home, should we go to Tokachi-dake hot spring? I heard outdoor bath there is fantastic. Dad? Yeah? You will come to my capping ceremony, right? What was that? What? I’ve told you already! That’s when I will receive my cap, the proper nurse’s cap. Oh right, oh right. Dr. Takeuchi said that he would like to have a chat with you then. Now is all right, but I will have to go to a general hospital next year. If so, I will have to be a resident there. It would be impossible to commute from here. Dad? Are you listening? Dad, don’t sleep! Mr. Wakui Mr. Yuuji Wakui Please remove all your clothing and lie down on this bed. Here Oh! Oh dear, How so? Cos, you beat me, I got shocked! Well, I’m a nurse, though still in the making. Nothing to be embarrassed about. Well, so you say… Out of all the places… Are you attending a part-time high school? That’s tough. Is that your dad? The man who comes to drop you off and pick you up at the station? Were you watching? Eh? Yeah. My home is in Rokugo, and there isn’t a bus around that time. I see. University? No I failed the entrance exam, for the third time. I go to a prep school. Wow, that’s tough. Kenji Miyazawa Do you like him? Why do you ask? You surprised me. Cos I was reading it too. Hooraaaay! No, I’m fine. Sorry sorry sorry! Sorry I was on the phone. Have you never heard? Talk in music. I always listen to this when I go to bed. First song today, here you go! This song is for Kyoko in Kushiro from Iwabuu in Rumoi. ‘Kanpai’ by Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi. Don’t you want some? Ah, no. I haven’t eaten yet. Thanks. It’s Yuuji, right? Auntie, Just as I thought! Haven’t you gone to Tokyo yet? That isn’t right. Uncle Shimizu has been telling you to leave home soon. I’m fine with the prep school in Asahikawa as for now. No way, that is no good. Uncle Shimizu said, The standard is far too different in Tokyo compared to Asahikawa. You gotta leave here for Tokyo as soon as possible. What are you gonna do if you fail again? Everyone has a high expectation of you! you ought to have passed the entrance exam the first time, still here, wasting time. Leave to Tokyo as soon as possible, ok? Everyone is waiting for you over there. I’ve received a letter from Dr. Takeuchi. About? Thanking me for the pumpkin. And also, He wants to have a chat with me after the capping ceremony. But I can’t make it that day. I’m really sorry about that. That’s bad. I’m going to mountain to pick some Hen of the woods mushroom this Sunday, Do you want to come along? I can’t this Sunday. Is that so? I understand you are tired. Sorry. Are you meeting a friend? Here is Takisato, The village I grew up in, They are going to build a dam here soon. Soon this station will also be gone. The fact that the village I grew up in will disappear, gives me a strange feeling. Now, I want to stay here as much as I can. What happened since then? What you’ve talked about before. To move to Asahikawa? Yeah. I still can’t bring myself to talk to my dad about it. He knows about it and avoids the topic too. I understand. It’s so tough, to leave him all alone. Are you moving to Tokyo? Someday, I will. When? Last time, your auntie was talking to you about it, about when are you planning to? Within this year? Sorry. Damn! I don’t even want to go to Tokyo! I want to stay in Furano forever. Dad, are you still awake? Yeah. From next April onwards, I will be living in the hospital in Asahikawa. I will so bad to leave you alone, but it seems that it has to be that way. Yeah. I’m sorry. Long time no speak, Jun I and dad are well. 6 months’ internship is finally over, and it was my capping ceremony today. Dad couldn’t come, cos he was busy. Since you don’t write to him at all, dad seems a little lonely. He’s been saying everyday that you might be home for this New Year. And dad… I’ve been writing to him all the time, but I’ve torn them up. Because I didn’t want to worry him. Today I had my hair dyed, and I thought to myself, that I won’t be able to go home because of this. Good evening! Good evening! Ta-dah! Yaaay! Wow!! That’s so cool! You did it! I was wondering why you skipped school today. Come here, come here, sis! So cool!! Who did it? Shinobu did! Look, look, ta-dah! Aren’t you too late and old for your high school debut now? Harsh! Shoooock! Jun, Aaah! You did it! Hey, that we talked about. Now? He’s waiting for us. Really? Really. Come quickly! Wow! Amazing! Is this it? So great! Tazawa, nice to meet you. Jun, Nice to meet you too. This is well, that… Well, the owner needs some cash quickly so, This is amazing, Yeah, it really really is. Why don’t you have a ride? Can I? Sure. Are you gonna ride it already? I’m gonna, I’m gonna. Cool! Why don’t you drive around a little? This was the 400 I even dreamed about. The one I have now is 50cc. Maybe this will be mine!! What happened!? Hey! Jun! What happened with your head?! Makeover. Isn’t this cool? Hm? Jun, what happened do you? Why on the earth did you have to do that for? What would your dad say when he finds out? You’re not going home to Furano for this New Year either? Or are you going to show that head of yours, to your dad, hm? He expects much from you, you know? That’s why we didn’t tell him every trivial thing, trying not to worry him, and yet, you take advantage of that… Auntie Yukio, it’s okay to tell him. Cos I don’t think I’m doing anything bad. I see. Jun, you’ve changed. Why did you come all the way to Tokyo? Perhaps I did change. Cos I was behind, I was so behind. A year and half has passed since I came to Tokyo. All I thought about was, to catch up with everyone else. I was too much of a bumpkin, from every single point of view. To be cool or not to be cool, that was far more important thing than studying or working, in my age. Even though, I did attend school, mostly. However, I have changed my daytime job for thrice within this year and half. I didn’t last long, since it was all monkey work, yet I could find plenty of jobs, even as a junior high school graduate. The place I started to work at since this Spring, was introduced by my night school best mate Akaman, they took me in without any difficulty. The job duty was also some monkey work, but I can look at many different cars personally, They sold me the 50cc I have now cheaply. It’s cheap, but do you have such money? That’s why I’m not going home for the New Year. You aren’t? How can I meet my dad with this head? Why not? No kidding, he’d faint! I told you, that I’d dye my hair to make my mind up about not going home for the New Year. Yeah, I heard that but… That’s why the money I’ve saved up for the trip and they money I get for my 50 and even so I’m still about 50,000 yen short. Right then, should I ask Mizutani-san for it? Mizutani-san? Yeah Mizutani-san here? Yeah He loans money, though he takes interest. Really? Yeah. Kids move out of the way. Yeah, move out. Here it comes! Watch out! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! It’s only that Eri is the one acting as a go-between. Yeah, that’s just the point which makes me feel somewhat uneasy. Her brother is the cadre of the “Shitamachi Kazan”. Yeah, cadre, so I heard. Oh cadre Yeah cadre That’s cadre brat Maybe you can ask Eri directly, to make it cheaper or let you buy it with monthly installment plan. How can I even ask her that? That’s too risky! You think? But I think she fancies you though. I heard she is really great in that. What? This! Akaman! Yes? Shit. The school starts at 5pm, and it finishes at 8:50pm. That evening Akaman acted strangely. Should we go to Eguchi’s tonight? Not tonight. You are acting strangely, did anything happen? See you. Hey wait! What is it? About what we talked about yesterday? Tazawa, whom I introduced you to yesterday. Yeah, right. I think it’s best if you don’t meet him in person. Ah, right, in that case… I will fix it all up with him for you. Ah, Right, But I feel bad to trouble you that much. My brother would be able to fix it. I know Tazawa through my brother to start off with. Leave this to me, ok? Eh? Ah, right, that is, yeah. I had a bad feeling about this. So you are from Hokkaido? Ah yeah, Furano… I know. My brother has a pair of trousers made by some fabric from Furano. Ah well, I don’t really know much about things like that… Do you have someone there? What? Seems like you have none over here. None what? Girlfriend. Ah no, I don’t. Face of Rei-chan flitted through my mind. Wherever are you now, Rei-chan? Do you want one? Huh? Ah Yeah, well, I do. How much do you know? Huh? About women. Ah well, about that… C? Oh no, no way C! Up until B? Ah no, not even B, You finished at A? Ah well, it’s rather embarrassing at this age, really… Well I didn’t have a chance cos where I’m from is depopulated, really depopulated. If you had the chance, would you want to right away? Ah well, that, If I want or not, then sure yeah. Oh? Oh? Is that really the time already? I better get going, or my auntie will nag me. Never mind that No, really no! Here! Please no. No about what? I can’t, I can’t! Here! No no, really no! Let me! Oh no, please let me off the hook! I will show you how! Please! Let me go! You said you’d eat potatoes if you’re out of curry and if you are really hungry, even what you really want is curry! There is someone I really care about! You didn’t say that before! But I do! Liar! It’s not a lie! Oh, here! Ahhhhh! Eri! You all right?! Hold on me! Go! Go away! Or I will beat you to death!! This is the worst-case scenario. Eri’s brother is a cadre of a motorcycle gang. I even heard that he has a connection with Yakuza. I could barely sleep that night. I felt more dead than alive even the day after, beside myself with fear. Akaman was weird even today, but more than that I was worried and nervous about the situation concerning myself, Eri, who went home soaked through that night, must have told her brother about me. That evening Akaman didn’t come to school. So I went by his lodge, but his bike wasn’t at its usual place. However, the light was on in his room window. Akaman, It’s me, I know you are in, Akaman! I thought you’re out, cos the bike wasn’t there. I don’t have it anymore. Ah? Why not? They took it. Who took it? They took it for my debt. For your debt? It was horrible, they threatened me through and through. They even kicked me then took my bike… By whom? You’d tell. I so won’t. Who did it? Is it someone I know? It’s Mizutani. Mizutani-san? He’s the worst, I’d never forgive this. How much did you borrow? 100,000 yen. (Around 900 USD, 620 GBP) After half a year, it doubled itself. Why did you borrow such money from him? Is it when you bought the bike? My mum, she’s ill, and can’t be helped anymore. Das is so depressed about it. I was there last summer, mum lost so much weight. People used to call her female sumo. Death means that I can never ever see her again, right? I might go home to Okinawa. I can’t leave my dad alone. His word, pierced through my heart. Dad, are you well? Is Hotaru being nice to you? I haven’t forgotten about you. You are always, on my mind. I’m certain that you don’t know that. When I left Furano, The money you gave the lorry driver, the brand-new notes with dirt on, he said he’d never be able to accept them, and told me to keep them for life. I always have them with me. Every time something happens, I’d take them out and have a look at them. And there is still the dirt which was on your fingers’ that day. To not to forget that date, I discreetly wrote the dates on them During the lunch break, the day after that man came. Hey, there is someone for you. Yes Hey It was nice meeting you last time. So what do you want to do with the stuff we’ve talked about? Ah yeah, well, about that Eri-chan told me to talk through her I came cos I was told to come! By Eri-can? Right. And when might that be? This morning. Oh Did she say anything? Yeah right, she did. Even her brother came out, that was tough! Ouch! 120000 yen would do. (Around 1145 USD, 870 GBP) What!? That’s what you wanted to talk to me about, right? Ah, right! Have a think then. Ah yes, I most certainly will. Fucking with me, you little brat?! It’s so damn cheap already, it’s a bargain! What the hell is there to think about?! If you don’t want it, there are plenty out there who will. Yes Presuming upon my kindness, so, is it a deal? Hey, don’t sponge off from our kid. Sponging ha! This brat is trying to take advantage of me. Hey I know that it doesn’t cost you a penny. Hm, so you think, but it ain’t cheap for me at all. In the end, I bought the bike. Finally 400 is mine! It was as if I was dreaming. In addition, apparently Eri-chan is quiet about the incident, and she even fixed the bargain price for me, all that made me feel so relieved. I was totally on the top of the world just then. Yet Furano got further away from me for a while. However, in the best season of this December for the first time in my life a terrible thing happened to me. And that began with arrival of two men. Engine number is Ah, this one ZX. Hi, I’m Kuroita. Is this yours? Yes How did you get hold of this? I bought it. From whom? From a someone called Tazawa. and from where is this Tazawa? from where? It’s someone I know. and where is he now? Well I don’t quite know. Quite cool hair you have there. Ah, yeah We’ll borrow this kid, boss. and I was taken to the police. Where did you nick it? That bike. What? I… You knew it was a stolen bike? What?! No! I! That Let’s hear about this Tazawa then? Please wait a minute, all I know is that Don’t play dumb with me with that cool hair of yours! Tazawa Ryo, 21 years old! Your relationship with this guy? For how long, and from where do you know this guy!! I tried my best to not blurt out Eri-chan’s name. I can’t forget what happened from then. They treated me as a criminal. The adults questioned me one after another, if I were to think, they started bang on the table. I can’t remember what I answered. The fear, the frustration, the feeling of wanting to burst into tears, I was so confused, I can’t remember a thing. In the end, almost 10 in the evening my innocence was proved. But case was not closed. It must’ve been tough on you. Watch out for Mizutani. Mizutani-san? He’s pissed, that you’re taken into the police. Mizutani-san is? He says that you knew, that is was a stolen bike. Did I ever… say such a thing? Mizutani-san I don’t remember that. Does anyone know? About the 20000 yen which was in here? (Around 190 USD, 145 GBP) It was in here this morning! I saw them with my very own eyes!! Oi! You think we did that?! No, that’s not what I mean Jun! Jun! Jun, stop it! Jun! Jun stop! Please stop! Please, it’s not them It’s me! I just wanted to borrow them for a bit! Give me back the notes! Those notes! Do you have the notes? No, they are gone, I’ve given them away. To whom? Please, I’m really sorry, I’ll give the money back to you tomorrow!! I’m asking who you gave them to! I’ll give them back for sure, tomorrow It’s not about the money!! The notes! Who did you give them to?! Mizutani, he came to collect my debt and both of the notes? Jun! Mizutani-san, About the brand new notes Akaman gave you today, Oh it’s you You’ve opened his locker? Sorry, but the brand new notes, those Akaman handed to you today Are you saying that he stole your money?! I’m sorry, I understand. You went through his pocket?! Sorry, it’s my bad but Mizutani-san No but! How dare you but me! I’m sorry. Being so clumsy yourself and ratting me out, causing me so much trouble! A body search on top that huh?! I’m sorry! Ah, I’ll buy them back!! The brand new bills Akaman handed to you today, were like a lucky charm to me and they are not any common notes and so Erm, with a bit of dirt in the corner, and with dates written on them 21 March 1987, you’ll know when you open them and take a look… What are you saying, stupid. Mizutani-san, Erm, now I don’t have money on me, but I’ll pay as soon as possible, If it’s too much to ask for, I’ll pay 30,000 yen instead! Cos there were 2 notes, right? As if the money remains forever with me! Money is a thing that comes and goes. Please then tell me! Where you spent them, to whom you paid them to? The 20,000 yen. Like hell I’ll give them to you, even if I had them! To a rotten thing like you! Mizutani! Jun! Mizutani-san! Mizutani-san! Are you all right?! Stop it, Jun! Hey! What’re you guys doing!? Good thing that his life isn’t in danger. One step wrong, you would’ve been charged with murder. Do you understand? Jun! I watched over you silently. Since I wanted to treat you as an adult. But Since when have you turned into a yob? Taking a stroll in the dead of night, driving around the bike, Nothing a person in his right mind would be doing. Much less hurting someone. Red hair, look into the mirror. Do you think you can go back to Furano with that hair? What would your dad think, when he sees your hair? What do you think of your dad? Working hard, all on his own. Not knowing a thing, and expects much from you. Do you never think about that? Are you not going to ask me the reason why we fought? Jun Are you not? What has the reason got to do with anything here? The reason why you got into a fight this time? We are way past that stage, don’t you get it?! What we’re discussing now is, why you ended up like this, and since when you turned into a yob! I am not a yob! You may believe in that yourself, yet how you are perceived by the others is… I admit that hurting him was bad, but I didn’t do anything else wrong. You can be sure of that? I am not a yob! I am not! Jun! Jun! Jun! I am not a yob!! Jun, we get that, I am not a yob!! Jun, we get that now, Hey, we get that, stop now. I understand that! Jun! The day after I lost my job. I heard about it. Late last night from Akaman. I found one, he had it in his pocket of the jacket, in the locker. Take it. Apparently he spent the other one. But I know where he’s spent it. At a pharmacy nearby. They’ll open at 10 am. in 30 minutes. So we look for it together. As for the last time, really, after that, but as for the stolen bike, I didn’t mention anything about Eri-chan. I know that. I heard. The New Year What are you going to do? If you are going back to your home town, you better dye your hair black. Dad the notes of yours, with a bit of dirt on, she looks for it so seriously for me. She is regarded as super dangerous, crazy girl even by our friends, But dad, She and I aren’t yobs at all. People see for example hair dyed in red and so on and assume that we’re against the common sense and crazy, but that’s merely opinion of difference in taste. Dad, right now, I really want to go back to Furano! For the first time since I got here, I feel it this way. I want to see you, dad, and Hotaru, brother So-ta, uncle Nakahata, and the mountains, snow. I want to sleep deeply in that snow. Mr. Jun Kuroita, he is son of yours, right? Yes. 17 years old, still underage. Well, he caused a case of bodily injury in Tokyo. I’m sorry. I would like to call Tokyo using No.100 (operator). Eh? Ah well, no, nothing. Dad! Eh? I’m home. What’s wrong? Nothing. What’s happened? Nothing. Did someone come? Jun!! Shh! He must be tired. Let him sleep. Hey, what happened? Visiting me this late? Jun is back. Sleeping like a log. Ah I see. Ah really. Ahh cold cold! But that his hair is all red and, he seems to have gone crazy then come home. Hm Situation like this, you know how to deal, right? Hotaru. Sorry did I wake you? Welcome home. What time is it now? 4:30 am. Are you still awake? No I got up just now, I’m going out soon. Dad is also up. Is that Jun? Yes, sorry. I’m home. Don’t worry, go back to bed. Sleep as much as you want. I’m sorry. It was unbelievable sleepiness. I wonder how long ago I could sleep this deep. Soon I was pulled back into my sleep again. And then I had a dream this time. In the forest Hotaru is walking there Hotaru and I were much much smaller. When I woke up it was already light. Oh Jun, are you awake? Welcome home. Welcome home. Welcome home. Thank you, I’m home. Former four gang leaders of Furano were sitting in a row. Oh he is up! Welcome home! Thanks. Jun, come here and have a seat. Come, come, come, come over here Long time no see eh! Come closer now. Aye aye aye aye aye, You’ve grown some hair here like a grown up huh? How old now? I’m 17. 17, right. 17 already. No wonder we grow old eh? Are you hungry? No, not so much. Ah? Hungry right? Cook something for him. No, I can do it myself. No! No! No! No! No! Jun! Sit still! We’re gonna shave your hair off! No way! No shaving! No way! I don’t wanna be as bald as an egg! So shaving is a no? No. Right, then how about a pair of hair clippers!? Snip snip shall we clip? No way, no clip either! No clipping!! No way! I’ll dye, please, I’ll dye my hair! Bro! Help me out! I’ll dye my hair, I’ll dye my hair! But indeed time flies. Yeah even Jun is at the age when he wants to turn himself into a punk. When was it that you had your hair shaved off? 14. That was pretty early. But I couldn’t just give up there and then. I see, yeah. How old were you? When I grew out of it? 18. Shin-san is the last amongst us, right? Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah that’s because I was boxing back then. No no no that’s not it, you are still not totally out, are you? No, that’s right. Hey watch it, I’m gonna beat you up! Just kidding. Shinjuku, what’s the reason of your growing out? I had a fight with my old man, and I ended up winning. Don’t fight with your old man, stupid. It must’ve been very shocking for my old man also, but I was way more in shock. That had happened to me too. It does hurt your feelings, doesn’t it? My old man aged rapidly since then. Yeah, yeah, You should never defeat your own father. Oh, it’s done. Done! Jun, wash your hair properly by yourself afterwards. Do you want your hair dyed too? Hey tease me not! Let’s go. Yeah, let’s go upstairs. Thank you so much for everything, I have inconvenienced you. That’s nothing, this is the quickest way. Hey shinjuku, did you come here by your car? Yes Can you give me a ride to town? Yes of course. Hey Jun, see you! See you! Thank you ever so much. I apologise for the inconvenience. It was like watching a film. But to prove it wasn’t just a film my hair is now black and I can finally feel at ease to pay courtesy calls. But somehow you are kinda city-like. Am I? How’s Tokyo? Nothing that great worth mentioning. So do you have someone there? Are you the one to say, when you get ditched so easily! Are you guys still doing that? Should I tell you? About the new one? Shut it! Shut it! Shut it! You shut it! Jun, it must be ages since you did this! Go go go! By the way, did you hear anything from Rei-chan? Nope. None at all? Nothing at all since then? She must’ve forgotten me already, long ago. What are you even saying. After that, I went to uncle Nakahata. Do you know, Jun? Your dad’s started building a log cabin again. He has? Yeah, this time is fabulous, with Canadian trees even! Wow. He didn’t ask anyone for help. He says he wants to do it alone. He says it doesn’t matter how many years it takes. He’s planing in the timber yard since the morning. Timer yard of the village, go and have a look. Hello. Hey hey! Do you know who this is? Is it Jun? Look how much you’ve grown! Everyone was so warm to me. Everyone treated me exactly in the same old way, just like in the old days. I went to Thomson woody village, where uncle Nakahata has opened recently, dad was there planing away. Hey I’m home. Welcome home. I’m sorry about last night. You slept so soundly, so I left you alone. I’m sorry. You’re tired, right? Yes I’m sorry. Shall I help you? Can you do this? I’m used to physical labour, I do it every day. I see. Well then, take this and help me. Here, like this, bit by bit. Ouch Like this Right right right right It’s quite tough, right? Since it’s freezing cold. You are quite good! My right fist hurt a little. But I didn’t want dad to worry. I heard you’re building a log cabin, is it true? Ah yeah, slowly. All by yourself? It’s my own house, so I’m going to build with joy. I’m gonna enjoy building it this time. Amazing. Somehow dad suddenly looked big, even physically just like he did in the old days. Did you talk with Hotaru? We only said hi. Should I tell you something good? Like what? Don’t tell Hotaru. Huh? What happened? She seems to be in love. Really!? Apparently she’s trying to keep it a secret. But I knew it long ago. He’s the guy who she commutes with, on the same train. Oh wow cool! What’s he like? What’s he like? I think he’s a student, But since I’ve only seen him from a distance, I couldn’t see him clearly. Do you want to have a look? Ohh yes! Should we go have a look at him today? Nearby here? How? They always get on the same train, so we wait for the train at some station when it passes by, for example at Biei or Bibaushi and get on the train, then quietly, we sit near them. Wicked thought you have! Hey that’s what you said. She’ll leave home next year. She’ll move to Asahikawa. It can’t be helped. I didn’t know. Thereafter I helped planing the whole day. My right hand did hurt from time to time, but I felt something very warm within my heart suddenly the tears were welling up in my eyes. Follow me quietly. Ouch Did they notice us? No, they didn’t. Which one is he? Which one? He isn’t here. He isn’t? Yeah, normally he is, but not tonight. Ah right, if he isn’t around, should we just go see her? That’s no good! Oh Oh that’s no good, oh What I’m doing is not nice, is it? Yeah So I do have this side of myself… Do you? I do, yeah. Yeah, I think you’ve inherited it, so you too, be careful with it. Right. Oh no. Hey wait! Hey! After knocking me down, that guy…! Aaahhhh! That can’t be true. Suddenly, it came to this. What time? To Sapporo. I got it. Welcome back! Thanks. Hotaru, your holiday starts from tomorrow, right? Yeah. How about we go to the hot spring tomorrow? The three of us! Hot spring? Isn’t it fully booked by now? But we can go and come back in a day, if it’s Tokachidake hot spring. It’s terrific with an open air hot spring! All three of us can soak in together! No way. Come on! That might not be the best idea. Isn’t it? Anyway, let’s go the hot spring! Let’s get into a bath where you can stretch your legs all you want! Ah, magnificent bath! Jun, hop in right away! Yes sir. You have to live with the small bath today though. But tomorrow, you’d be able to stretch your legs all you want. Dad, Eh? About tomorrow, I’m sorry but I cannot come with you. I really can’t tomorrow. Ah Did you have a plan already? He’s leaving. You’ve been watching him right, the one I’m with on the train. *Sigh* Is that true? We promised that he’d come to our house to meet you at New Year’s. But suddenly he has to go to Tokyo. He’s leaving tomorrow. This means that we won’t be able to see each other for some time. That’s why I really want to see him off You should go. Yeah, you go and see him off. Of course, you go and see him off. I’m sorry. Hot spring can wait, we can go there any time. Please just go without me. No, don’t you worry about that. It won’t be so much fun, just the two of us. Go and see him off. Go and see him off. I’m sorry. Are you awake? I am. Today I heard from dad for the first time. From the next Spring, are you leaving to Asahikawa? I have no right to say this, but dad will be all alone. Today I saw the log cabin. Does that mean he is waiting for us? He hopes for that one day we’ll come back to him, and so he is building the log cabin in hope? Don’t talk about that. When I hear about this, I’ll end up crying. Ok. Is he a good guy? He goes to Tokyo, but is it for good? Please Jun, don’t talk about that either. Auntie in Tokyo, I wonder if she is well? Yeah, we’ll need help again. Right, we’ll need her care. This morning I dreamt a strange dream. I was with you holding hands diving deep into an extremely clear lake, right through to the bottom. There seems to be the bottom of the dam of Takisato. When we dived deeper, there was a village. You pulled my hand and dived deeper and deeper to where Sorachigawa once flowed a long time ago. There was still a grove, still in the shape of the old days, sunken under the deep water. Having done that we saw 2 initials engraved on one of the trunks of a tree H and Y These 2 initials still remaining on a tree trunk deep under the lake, where no one knows of anymore. H and Y engraved. I’ll do my best so please, you also do your best. Welcome home. Thanks. Where is Hotaru? Seems to have gone upstairs. Is the water hot enough? Yeah very good. Dad Hm? I wanted to tell you earlier, but I caused a trouble in Tokyo. What kind of trouble? I got into a fight, and injured him. Why did you get into a fight? He stole most precious thing from me. I see. Whatever was stolen from you, was that so important to you even enough to injure somebody? Yeah Then that couldn’t be helped, could it? No matter who you are, as long as you are a man, there is a time a man has to fight no matter what people say. Yeah Dad Yeah? And I haven’t told you about this yet, I have changes jobs 3 times already in Tokyo. I couldn’t last long, so I changed 3 times already. When I was young 6 times no 7 times I changed jobs 7 times. This runs in family so don’t worry about that. Yeah Dad I would love to build the log cabin with you. Can I find a job here and help you build the cabin together with you? That can’t be. I’m not gonna let anyone help. I’m going to build the cabin without any help all by myself. That’ll be my home, where I’ll live by myself. So I’m going to enjoy every bit of building it. I’m going to find stones for the fireplace one by one, and I’ll pile them up with a well thought out planning. And I’ll build a veranda facing the forest. A huge living room and my bedroom and crazily gigantic bathroom where I’m going to fit in a bath that big that my legs will never reach the other end, no matter how hard I stretch them out. I’ll draw water from the stream, electricity wouldn’t be installed. There’ll be a skylight with all the stars to gaze, and I’ll go to bed early when a night without starts comes. Living in that house, I’ll make a little vegetable patch, and go to the forest everyday to pick wild plants and mushrooms and all the rest I’ll live on the money you send me. Will you send me? Sure That’s a promise then! Yes And When each of you kids get married and bring home wife or husband or grandchildren I’ll only let those who sent me money stay and I’ll become a nagging old man who the children-in-law will want to stay clear of so I’ll become a stubborn old man through and through oh what a fun! But the grandkids the grandkids I’d dote on madly tiny and helpless just like you lot were once upon a time grandkids who’d be so similar to you. Dad Are you awake? Don’t fall asleep! As if I’d fall asleep! Jun! Radio! Don’t you know this song!? Now they are playing this song on somebody’s request. And it is for Jun in Furano, from Rei Oosato in Sapporo! So on the third day of the New Year, I went to search for Rei-chan in Sapporo. Thank you ever so much, I’m sorry for the trouble. Could this be? Oosato-san isn’t at home. Welcome! Welcome! What time do you finish? 4pm How have you been? Well. How about you, Jun-kun? Me too. I’m so happy. I couldn’t believe it. Neither can I! Hotaru happened to be listening to the radio. That’s unbelievable! That radio programme is only broadcasted in Hokkaido, right? I thought you’d be in Tokyo for sure. What happened to your hand? I just bumped into something. I thought you’d forgotten me already. Didn’t get a word from you. This is the third time. What is? that I sent a request to the radio programme. Why didn’t you contact me directly? I wrote to you. Once I ended up putting the letter half way into the postbox but stopped How so? I was scared. Of what? Your reply. Nothing to be scared of, is there? Do you live alone in that room? I share a room with a girl who works at the same restaurant. And your dad? He’s somewhere. Hey, do you remember? The cafe we used to go with, the one with skylight. I do. I’ll take you there! I still can’t believe it. That you came to see me. Tokyo did many fantastic things happen to you there? I wonder. Cos so many bad things happened one after another recently. I’d been so drained. Actually coming back to Furano this time, made me realise how warm Furano is so I asked my dad if I could stay here. He said no with a smile. Dad started building a log cabin by himself. I asked him to let me help But he said he won’t let me steal the fun. He was smiling goofily. I was thinking about dad. That time dad separated from mum and came to Furano taking us two with him. Dad at that time must have been over 40. At that time I was too young and had no understanding about his feelings So I always scorned the stupid goofy smile of his his goofiness inside my heart But dad now I understand a little. Now I started to understand you a little. Up until now it never even crossed my mind the suffering you endured that time your sorrow your pain your toughness Your greatness as a man that time For the first time now I started to understand. Dad I now for the first time After that we didn’t exchange a word and walked and walked towards the station. Rei-chan didn’t try to say anything But the warmth of her arm made me feel that she’s talking to me constantly. That was what happened this New Year. What do you mean disappointed!? Did you think Furano was that backward? We live there, you know? leading a life You came here by a car, looking around for a day or two, and you say you’re disappointed that here was actually civilised? Then why don’t you try living here? Why don’t you try living somewhere without electricity or any mod cons? in -20°C? Just kidding. Actually I don’t have electricity installed at home. It’s wind power generated. Aha The wind power generator is made by my son. Jun made it when he’s in the 3rd year of secondary school. (14-15 years old) He is now in Tokyo. He changed his job again Yeah Huh? I beg your pardon? My wife my wife has passed away, yes She was a good woman. Oh no, you’re making a good man cry! Let’s drink, lady you can really drink! Eh? Who is it? Suffering from piles? Who is? Oh you! I know a good doctor, I can introduce! From Furano, take a train from Furano to Asahikawa, hang on, I’ll draw you a map, right I’ll draw a map Dr.Takeuchi, he’s called Dr.Takeuchi It has to be him in Asahikawa My daughter called Hotaru is there, she’s a nurse.
