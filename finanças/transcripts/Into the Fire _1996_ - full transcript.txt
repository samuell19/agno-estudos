[sombre music] [rustling] [breathing heavily] [heavy footsteps] I think he must be working late. Wracking his brains about how he's gonna pay his bank charges. He didn't bank with me, so I'm not guilty. [chuckling] Hell, he puts the hours in, he always has done. That was called being busy, Frank. Now it's more like the captain staying with his ship. I've known him for 25 years. He's a survivor. Like yourself, Frank. [knocking] [electronic zapping] [horn blaring] [screeching brakes] [siren blaring] [vehicles rushing] [car radio chattering] [honking] [sirens blaring] Ted...What's up? It's a suicide. Frank, Lieutenant Garbin. [metallic rattling] [music echoing] [machine whirring] We're getting a bit low on fittings, Frank. Sorry...yeah. New booker should be here in the morning. Might as well take the afternoon off. Morning, Frank. [Man] Morning, Mr. Candy. Sorry about the recourse, just sable. Oh, it's not your fault. That quality control over there is a right, a little bit left. Blame her. All right, Marnie. She could send herself, if you're not careful. Ah, she will anyway. Jill, Tim says, get back in at the back end floor. How did it go? Well, they said cause of death was suicide. I think it was more bit by bit. I brought glasses up to the party. We celebrate more than ever this year, should we. Martin was just saying about buying some computerised machinery. A click and press even, help you cut down on labour costs. I'm at the top end of the market. We go for a hand-crafted look, you know that. We sell quality. That's fine. In a market that small, where do you go for new customers? I won't start making crap. Neither of you are wrong. He does know his market. And your brother knows what? Financial control. Tractors, your company made tractors for Christ's sake. Money's money. You're going to have to put some of them on short time working. Other than that, you're gonna have to start making redundancies, Frank. I don't see any other way. Six weeks you've been with us, Martin. You asked me to join you. How many offers did you have? You had no other choice. And how much choice do you think you've got? [door rattling] What happened? Well, I wished him a safe trip back to the states. Come on, Brian, what'd they say? Oh, they want 3000 shipping out. What? [Brian] 3000. Yes! But they want it in six weeks. We need 10, 11 weeks to do an order that size. It's gotta be six, Frank. Can't argue, can I? You could try. How many of the machines will that tie up? And what am I supposed to tell them, that it's inconvenient? That we're grateful for their order, but couldn't they make a little smaller? What are the credit arrangements? What exactly did they want? All right, we get most of the girls on this and put the smaller orders back. Right now, we need every single one of them out there. Plenty of life left in us, darling. [smooches] Plenty on life. After police gave chase, the offender was apprehended. The stolen items were found on him. He offered no resistance during his arrest. He's charged with burglary having entered part of the premises as a trespasser, the offender stolen items of clothing. Has the offender any previous convictions? Not to our knowledge, no, ma'am. The offender is 18, unemployed and lives alone with his mother who works part-time at Turf Accountants. Anything to say? It weren't premeditated or anything. It just happened and I'm sorry for all the upset I've caused, to me mum, especially. Well, he's refused to name the others involved. I really think a custodial sentence is appropriate. Not according to the pre-sentence report, nor me. This is a first offence. Can't we paint some fence in a children's home or somethin'? A bit piece of piss. I'm trying to do my best for you! You bastard! [smacks] I'm trying to do my best! Mum! I'm just gonna have to get back onto our leather suppliers and see if they'll rethink the credit terms, because Dykes certainly aren't going to pay us in advance. Anyway, see you later. You pick orders out for canvas and fittings, too. We need an extension of the overdraft. How much more? 90,000. That's a lot of money, Frank. What do you intend to use, then, as security? The house. Why don't you just throw me in as well? Look, this order is proof that things have turned the corner for me, for us. I know the house is a lot, but the business is what I am. I won't let you down. [loud rustling] [distant singing] Sorry if I kept you waiting. Thanks for agreeing to see me. You said it was about your son. You do remember him, don't you? Danny. Only see so many. Not so many, too many. I'm wondering if you'd mind seeing him again. He's done something. He doesn't do anything. -So. -If he had something, somewhere to go. I know it's asking a lot. [Frank] Asking what? An opportunity, really. Some sort of trainee. Recommend him, you mean? I meant your factory. You taking him on, if you've got something. Oh, I see. Well, I haven't, not really. I know it's asking a lot. It's just that I said I'd do something. I'd try to... Anyway, thank you. How's he getting on with his community service? Does it. [Frank] Does he know you're here? No...I just wanted to keep him honest, you know? Mrs. Cole, ask him to come and see. Really? We're in the middle of a big order, so maybe we can work something out temporarily, if he wants to. Oh, he'll want to. I'll make sure he wants to. [door slams] Oh, it's running between the various sectors, really, Danny. From the cutters to machiners, picking up fittings, taking some over to quality control. [clicking] Ginny, this is our new boy, Danny. She'll take you in hand. I beg your pardon? I meant explain. [loud music playing] She preferred the first version. [giggling] [squeals] [clicking] Frank! [loud music playing] [cheering] [clapping] Oh, it's beautiful, Leigh. I bet you've never said that about a sewing machine before. [laughing] You're here to enjoy yourself, Hazel, enjoy yourself. Congratulations, Dad. Thanks for coming up, Son. Oh, here he is, the heir apparent. What about me? Oh, I could never bags, Ginny. I make a living with my mouth. Pity you weren't here to help me with this speech. That's different, Dad. You'll be speaking from the heart. -Frank. -Come, speech, speech. [distant singing] Going swimmingly by the looks of it. Just lost a major order. How do you know? I live here, remember? Well, they both seem fine. Don't be so complacent. They're talking, aren't they? Anyway, I just happen to think there's more to them than the fortunes of this firm. Let's just hope we never have to find out. [banging] Have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen! Come on, hurry up, he's getting nervous. [chuckling] This is a very special day for me and Frank. Well, I'm sure it is for all of you as well. So, come on, Frank. [rustling] Well, it's lovely to see you all looking smart for a change. [laughing] And judging by the amount some of you are knocking back tonight, I'm glad there's no work tomorrow. [laughing] We'd be finding handles underneath bags and zips that finished half way. I'm sorry, sorry, Jesse. I forgot, that's the way you work, anyway. [groans] But you, you haven't all been here 20 years, but I hope you will be for the next 20 and I really appreciate the work you've put in, the contribution you've all made to making this company work. Anyway, we've come this far. We can go a lot further. Can I ask you to raise your glasses to the future and to Frank Candy and company? [All] Frank Candy and company. Well done, Frank. [clears throat] [applauding] [distant singing echoing] I felt like a bit of a fraud, asking them to toast to our future. What are you supposed to do? Tell them about your overdraft? Brian Dutch thought he saw our future. He voted with his feet. Silver lining. Couldn't afford him anyway, Frank. Sales are up to you now. What's gonna happen in six months time, Matt? Will the bank call in this loan? [clears throat] Depends on your performance, like I was saying. Yeah, it's up to me. Buckles, snap links, slides, loops. They're all solid brass. Kidd leather on the linings and edgings, rubber bonded canvas and the heavy stitching here. Two rows, not one. It's the same for all the bags, hand, shoulder, overnight, travel. Now, what we're doing more and more is making for companies like yourselves who used to do business with the bigger manufacturers, but because those manufacturers are only prepared to do large runs, now, their minimum is too much. We can be far more flexible. Well, I'll, I leave it with you, shall I? [rustling] Hello, Margaret. [Margaret] Well, Max? [Max] Will you get Deaconson Gordon from Accounting? Have a nice time. [cheerful music] Don't eat too much popcorn. It's fattening. [giggling] Oh, you should worry? Anyways, it's nice to meet you, love, anyway. You, too. That's a nice bag. [dog barking in distance] Oh, Danny got it cheap from where he works. Ooh, that was lucky. [rustling] Companies stage manage their AGMs now, Dad. They have big marketing budgets. Anything to disguise the fact that the quality of the product might not be up to much, hmm? You sound like an Old Testament prophet sometimes. Making things is obviously a mugs game. I booked a table for two, name of Candy. Yes, Mr. Candy. [distant piano music] Now, could you come this way, please? [scraping] So, how did it go with the buyer today? Thanks, oh, very well, very well, yeah. They liked the look of what we do. It looks like there's going to be a big order in the offing. [clicks] [rattling] Got the bag cheap, did you, Danny? How cheap? As cheap as you? I don't know what you're talking about. I go to Mr. Candy about giving you a job. He actually takes you on and what do you do? You steal from him. I call that pretty cheap. Don't you? It won't be missed. Don't you understand how to behave? Don't you understand anything? Am I the only person in the world who's ever pinched off from where he works? Everybody does it. Well, maybe they think they're owed some it. You owe him! He very probably did set fire to the shop, but what you feel in your water isn't exactly the same as proof of each and every element of the offence, is it? Certainly wasn't three seats of fire and paint stripper poured everywhere. Clever bastard is going to get away with it. Clever, innocent bastard. Not guilty. [Woman] You are free to go. [honking] Taxi? Ginny, come on, get in. The bus'll be here in a minute. Get in. [distant honking] [showering] Is it one of the kids? Bill's lost his job at Weldon's. Him and 17 others. Christ! It's just come out of the blue. No warning, nothing. Don't know how we're gonna cope with Christmas. [Frank] Is there anything I can do? Keep me in work. You'll never have to worry about that, ever! I mean it! I've had 18 years with you. I know. I'll be back about 11. [smooches] What's this thing, again? Oh, the probation officer set it up. Young offenders talking about detention centres. Most men have hobbies You get your kicks from being a pillar of the community. [crackling] [whistling] [pounding] [loud whistling] [shouting] [thuds] This isn't bollocks, is it? What do you mean? What do you mean? I need some help. Your sort of help. I'm a plumber by trade. I have a business. Same as the shopkeeper, at the business. -So. -This would be along those lines. Better in a way, in that there'd be something in it for you immediately. I haven't got the faintest idea what you're talking about. Money, I'd commission you to-- Commission? [scoffs] [distant whistling] Look, I've made a mistake. Can you get out, please? I don't do this, I don't. I'm sorry, you're finished. You'll have to get out, get out. Get out! [engine revs] [shouting] [banging] [loud whistling] [rustling] [soft sobbing] I, you said to hang around. Did I? You said you wanted a word. Oh, sorry, sorry, son. It was just about your probation. Look, we'll leave it for a bit, okay? Sorry to mess you about. Getting into belts now? I'm always looking to branch out. Don't let the grass grow on their feet -and all that. -Sound. When you, this belt business is just an idea. If you could keep it under your hat. [rolling] Oh, a secret. If you like. Anyway, I know you don't tell tales. You didn't tell on your mates, did you? No, just don't do them sort of things, do you? As a magistrate, I'd have to differ, but as a man-- The laws matter more sometimes, don't they? Why are you copying them belts? [scuffing] [rustling] Nice bags. It's stock I can't sell. Won't have to now, will ya'? Do you use anything in the treatment of them bags? You know, linseed oil, oil like that? We don't use anything. What's through there? Oh, dispatch office. Don't worry, I'll do things properly. I take pride in my work. So do I. This is half. Just leave it to me now, okay? What, now? Well, it starts now, not with a fire, though. Look, Mr. Joyce-- Call me Paul. Trust me. I'll call you. Off you go, bye. [rustling] [soft thuds] [soft showering] [engine revs] [crashing glass] [siren blaring] [beeping] I put sugar in. What's this? [clicking] [soft music] Factory alarms going off. Police say there's some windows smashed. Oh great. Told them you're out discussing crime. What did they say? Didn't they believe you? Why wouldn't they believe me? What did they say? Well, they thought it was ironic, too, Frank. Where's your sense of humour? Be back in a bit. [rustling] Why don't we drag him out of the factory, make him come and have lunch with us. [giggling] Hey, Judge. He has a sandwich in the office. He always has a sandwich. That's what I'm suggesting he come out with us. I don't think he'd be very good company at the moment. Why not, what's wrong? [heavy footsteps] I don't know. You must know. Well, I don't. He isn't saying. Is it the business? [scoffs] He can always talk about the business. I wonder what it is then. [rustling] [crashing] [metal clanging] [beeping] [siren blaring] [thuds] [engine revs] When...okay. [soft rustling] [Lynne] Who is that? Well, just about my court appearance is next week. -Really. -Really. Why don't you believe me? If I didn't know better, I'd think you were seeing someone else. Do I know better? I've never cheated on you, okay? I've never cheated on anybody. [distant chirping] How have the police been? Last time they seemed a bit pissed off. Good. Don't remove any photos of your wife and the kids from your desk. It's tonight, all right. Don't touch the alarm. And when you get the call, as far as you're concerned, it's just kids again, setting off the alarm. Take your time. Don't want you to gettin' there and trying to put the fire out, do we? [loud rustling] [pop music playing] [crumpling] All right, then. We should go for whatever afters. [soft ticking] [soft rustling] [ringing] [creaking] [clicking] [crackling] [thuds] [ringing] Hello...oh, Christ! I'll get down there as quick as I can. [rustling] Oh, God, not the bloody alarm again. Frank, do you want me to go down to the store? -No. -I don't mind. I said no! Oh, come on, Frank, give me the keys. I'll go turn the alarm off. It's not just the bloody alarm! What is it then? Frank, Frank, tell me! Fire! It's a fire. Oh, my God. I'll come with you. No, you won't! I want you to stay here for the time being. If the police call, at least there'll be someone here for them to talk to. -Frank. -Don't worry. You'll be more useful if you stay here. [crackling] [tapping] [rap music playing] I think it's time to go home. We're on our way. Get your hand away. All right, I'm getting something out of my pocket anyway. We're in a car! Not in the back of somewhere. What do you take me for? I supposed that means I'll only run and get me somebody else. Wrong, get out. Oh, Holly. Get out! [thuds] [engine revs] Holly, Holly! [squealing] Holly, Holly! Holly! [ringing] [crackling] [thuds] [soft rustling] [ringing] [thuds] Where is the bloody fire? [ringing] [rustling] [loud exploding] [roaring] [crackling] [hissing] Haven't you got a home to go to, Michael? You know me, Eddie, I've got a professional interest. It's gonna be one of yours, then? Aye, more than likely. Just waiting for the call, you know. [crashing glass] Hey, Constable! [crashing] [roaring] Are you the key holder? Can you come with me, please, sir? Just leave the keys in the ignition, sir. [distant radio chatter] [loud hissing] This is Mr. Candy, the key holder. [siren blaring] What's the ambulance for? [thudding] What's the ambulance for? [dripping] [clicking] [retching] Sorry, I'm sorry. Did he have a grudge against you? Sorry? Any reason why he'd wanna do this? You think he? It doesn't take much working out, does it, eh? No, no, I suppose not. [clicking] [distant radio chatter] [rattling] [engine puttering] Who was it? Danny, the young kid. I know him. Jesus Christ. I'm going to see him mother. Shouldn't we leave it to the police? I want to. It's not up to you to. He died in my factory! I want to. Mr. Candy, I work for Bambos, loss assessors. If you want any representation for your claim, we're very willing to take responsibility. Get out of my sight. Not just injured. You really mean dead, don't you? Identify the body. You're gonna say that. That what you're gonna say as well? He worked for me. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Cole. See...condolences now. That's it, then. Is there anything I can do for you? Aren't you gonna say that as well? -I just came-- -I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Candy. It's just that everybody's trying to be so... What was he doing in there? I don't know. Well, you should know! It's your bloody factory! You should know, you should know! [sobbing] I want my baby. I want my baby! I want my baby, I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby! I want my baby, I want my baby! I want my baby! [heavy sobbing] [rustling] Police need to talk to you later. [water dripping] Look how dirty I am. [soft splashing] I wonder why he did it. I wonder what made him. Who knows what was in a kid's mind. Some people might say you contributed to it. Why? To give him a stiffer sentence, instead of taking him on. Look, if you give someone an opportunity and they set a match to everything including themselves, it's terrible, but it is their responsibility ultimately. Isn't it? I know. I know. [whizzing] So you think the kid went in there to steal? He had a criminal record, didn't he? And he thought a fire'd cover his tracks. Covered him. You wait and see. They'll find petrol burns or lighter fuel. That was great timing, the kiddo. What do you mean? The way things have been, a fire is what some people would have been wishing for. Not us. [splashing] You got him out, you'll put him back. Quite easy, really. [distant honking] [heavy footsteps] So, do you think we're going to have to pay out on this? Well, I thought I'd make some further inquiries while we wait for the forensic report, you know. Status of finances, stuff like that. He could've got the kid to do it, couldn't he? That's a bit of a vindictive view you're taking, eh? Thought that's why we call in people like you, Michael. Yes, well, I think it's a clean claim. Mr. Candy's a very clean man. Then you should be glad he's insured with you. Let's just wait and see, shall we? [metallic rustling] [sighs heavily] It's funny. I thought they were gonna be hot. That's twice you've seen him. I keep seeing him. You know. Thank you. [rustling] Seven, eight, nine. No offence. How are you? How am I? How do you feel? I'm on for manslaughter if this comes out. How do you think I feel? What about the boy? That's your department. Isn't it proper playing on your mind? Don't you care? Don't do that morality shit! You're here giving me the rest of my money, Mr. Magistrate. Mister conspiracy to commit, mister accomplice. I can't stand it! You know? -I just can't. -Yeah, well you just make sure you keep it to yourself. The thing is, you're the only person I can talk to about it. Find a priest. I'm an arsonist. I'm lost I actually feel lost! Look, I'm aware now, all right. Now just piss off and leave me alone. Would you do it again? If somebody else asked you, could you, would you, could you? Get away from me! Keep away from me! It never happened, okay! It never happened! [distant barking] [engine revving] We've got a fatality as well as a burnt-out factory to deal with. Poor guy's desperate to pick up the pieces. I feel sorry for him. Are you allowed to? Yeah, as long as I don't allow me emotions cloud my judgement . [rustling] I must've chucked it out, Michael. Your mother, eh? Hey, what's she like? I'm surprised you haven't got odd socks on. I have paid the bill, anyway. Yeah, but I'd like to see the itemised one. You know what they're like. Charge you for a two-hour call you're never made to Inverbervie or somewhere. Not with your ability. [Michael] Where's the bill, then? Have you tried the fruit bowl? Order accounts for the last three years? VAT returns and the details of our overdraft. Some people will tell you all of their records went out with the fire, eh? Must make you suspicious. What have we done? No, it's just my job to investigate the claim and this is all part of the investigation. As soon as we get it out of the way, you can get back to turnover, hopefully. Here we are. [groans] Thanks very much. Oh, Mrs. Candy. I noticed in the company house report that you're a director of the company. Did you play an active part at all? No, not really, just moral support. Needed more now than ever, I'd have thought, eh. Yes. [rustling] I've eliminated accidental causes. Not a presence of any accelerant. But look at the smoke staining on the hinges of the stockroom door. It's thick and grimy, consistent with a smouldering fire. And what's more, it indicates that the door was closed while the smoke was depositing on those hinges. And despite the flashover, we haven't found any sort of deposits on the surface of the light socket. Slow burn. So the flashover was caused by the door being opened. Ventilation, flammable, gaseous, pyrolysis products accumulate. Someone opens the door and whoosh. So the pattern of events is we have an arsonist that sets a fire in the packing room, closes the door, lets it smoulder for what? A considerable time. And then opens the door again. Causing the flashing over. And all this time, the alarm's going off. [snickers] There's no logic in any of this at all, is there? It's not my problem that's logic. Anyway, people behave strangely in fires. Not if they're supposed to be setting them. [engine churning] -Oh. -Yes. Hello, Frank, come in. [rustling] Would it be better if I come back later? No, Louise was just getting off anyway. Was I? She lives opposite. She's told you who I am, but she hasn't told me who you are. Oh, I'm, I'm Danny's boss. I was. I hear you've been more than his boss lately. Don't forget your old friend. -No. -If there's anything you want, just knock, all right? [rustling] Both single parents. Except now I'm just a single. You know what I mean? What it is, I know the police are releasing the body, Danny's body. I know you'll need to be making funeral arrangements. Would you like me to make them for you? My son stole from you, you know. One of your bags, he gave it to his girlfriend. I know he was no angel. I know police think he set fire, while he was stealing more bags probably. Because they think he was trying to get his own back on you because he knew you're going to let him go. -Well. -Really, I know you wouldn't say it to me, really. You must would like to see it back on him, I mean. You must be thinking, the little gobshite. Never, I swear. You're a very unusual man, then. To be honest, I'm sorry I ever took him on. And yet you want to make his funeral arrangements. You see. A more than unusual man. How would you like to be remembered? Sorry? That's what people ask, isn't it? What people say about you. Nobody's got much to say about Danny, have they? Thief who got burned in a fire. His death doesn't count for much, does it? This just isn't the man you go in feeling suspicious about, you know, -but there's motive. -Mmh hmm. And then there's the fire itself. Everyone's thinking the kid did it after some kind of revenge thing, but he just didn't behave like that. [soft dial tone] So if the boy didn't act like he set the fire, who did set it? [clicking] [Michael] Nothing's what it seems. That's all I know at the moment. [clunking] So, you're going to have to unravel the mystery, then. Well, the insurance company will just need enough to deny on the balance of probability. You know, the truth won't have to come out. [soft crackling] You're not eating anything? Not hungry. What time did you receive a call to say the alarm would be inactivated? Oh, well, I'm not, I'm not really sure. Well, Central Station reported an activation at 10:15, so you would have received a call minutes after that. Yes, I suppose so. And what time did you get to the factory? [Frank] Sometime after that. Well, the police said it was a little after 11, so that's 45 minutes at least. Were you delayed on the way down there? -Well, a bit. -A bit. What, you didn't think it was urgent or anything then? No, I had two previous break in attempts. I thought it was more of the same. [chuckling] You seem to be playing the policeman, Mr. Ride. Oh, I'm more thorough than them. [chuckles] You think you'll discover something they've missed? No, I'm just trying to ascertain the behaviour of the insured at the time of the fire. But, I didn't know there was a fire, did I? No, no, that's right. Now, you sentenced Danny and then you took him on. It's a bit odd, isn't it? You can't preach responsibility without showing some. He must've been very grateful. You mean grateful enough to set fire to my factory for me? As I said, I'm just trying to eliminate that as a possibility. [rustling] [chirping] [thudding] [heavy footsteps] [rustling] What are you doing? This, he came up to me the night of the fire in London. He said he'd represent me. He's going to. You sent him away. I'm not speaking to that Ride character again without representation. [beeping] He doesn't believe you, does he? You know these insurance people. Always look into avoid admitting liability. Any excuse! I need protecting. You go to the loss assessor and you'll have to answer more questions. You'll have to say more and more -and more. -So. [busy toning] You might not be able to keep it up, Frank. Tell me you had nothing to do with it. Go on. Tell me it wasn't you. Tell me. The boy wasn't meant to be there. You didn't have anything to do with the boy being there. Is that what you're saying? Lynne, he didn't start the fire. -You...it was you. -No. [Lynne] Who? I commissioned someone. Paid them. Deliberately went and-- An insurance scam. Wasn't meant to do any harm. It was meant to do the opposite because, because, Christ, Lynne. In six months time, everything I've worked for, the business, this house, through no fault of my own. It wasn't meant to do any harm. It was just meant to give me another chance. And the boy...Danny. Well, I don't know! Wasn't supposed to be there! No one was. But he was. He must've heard the alarm and gone in and just one of those things. [sobbing loudly] Just one of those things? You know what I meant. I don't know what you bloody meant! I'll never know what you bloody meant! [pounding] [shouting] I just wanted to survive! Isn't that what you wanted? [sobbing] I decided to get pragmatic, Lynne, to adapt. Just like you wanted me to. I have nothing to do with what you've done. I just didn't want things to come apart. But now they have. Now the only difference between you and Alec is that he only managed to destroy his own life! So long as I was allowed the claim, I didn't think I'd be letting anyone down, only me! You were supposed to be made different. What are you going to do about it? Quite easily show me. There's the phone. Go on...go on. He may be dead, but I know what I meant! [church bell ringing] [soft sobbing] [echoing footsteps] Deny liability. Now it's you who's taking the vindictive view. Well, he seems like a decent man. He's got a story, but the trouble is it doesn't wash. As far as the police are concerned, the boy was acting on his own. Candy will commenced proceedings against us. Well, maybe he won't. And even if he does, you've got enough to defend the claim. Well, what happens if we have to face a big loss of profits claim and damages for forcing him into liquidation? Now, if you can prove that fire was down to him, fine. We'll deny liability. We may even have enough for a criminal conviction. But if you can't show that the boy was acting on his behalf-- Maybe the kid wasn't acting at all. What? If the kid was the arsonist, why didn't he act like it? I mean, you've seen the forensic report. Ah, kids can do funny things when they're breaking the law. If you want me to find evidence of connivance, maybe I just haven't found out who Candy was conniving with. So you've dispensed with one theory and now you've got a new one. Well, the same rule applies. It's called show me, soon. So sorry for your loss. Mrs. Cole, my name is Michael Ride. I'd just like to extend my belated condolences to you. That must've been very harrowing for you to sit through. Mr. Ride is investigating the insurance claim on the factory. Well, does it need investigating? Well, that's not the word I'd use. I'm assessing loss and liability. My son was liable. Weren't you're listening? [thudding] [electronic chirping] Didn't know he broke his wrist that night. You'd think I'd know that, wouldn't you? At least you know he was unconscious. [scoffs loudly] Very reassuring, the fractured skull, you mean? Yeah, I should be grateful for that, shouldn't I? I buried him two weeks ago, Frank. Felt like they've dug him up again. [heavy footsteps] [rustling] Anita! It's all right, Louise, I'm fine, thanks. [rattling] Well, I'm going to have leave you now. I'll make you some tea. I could do with the company. What about? I mean you. [thudding] [rustling] [smooching] [heavy breathing] There he is. He's scorching around like some kindly uncle. Everybody thinking he really does care. You know what a responsible man he is. -Michael. -And you know what the sickest irony of all is? She hasn't gonna faintest idea of what he might be responsible for. I'm, I'm responsible for something. What? I've been seeing someone. Well, what for? Someone else. Are you with someone else? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What did I do? Look, I've stopped it now, okay? I just wanted to tell you. I made a terrible mistake, but it's finished now. [groaning] -And I just-- -Finished. But you've just told me what you've done! What you've been doing! It'll never be finished. [crumpling] It's your wife, isn't it? You never been unfaithful to her, have you? No, I've never been unfaithful to her. I've always been very strong about that sort of thing. I'm not sure what I stand for anymore. Starting to betray everybody. I'm betraying you right now. Don't be silly. Is it? I'm in your bed. -I've just-- -Made me happy. It made me glad. [distant barking] Have I? Can't last, though, can it? [sighs heavily] You're married, you feel bad. Not if you want me. I want more. Not my place to ask, though, is it? Oh, it is. [distant laughing] Can I make you happy? Could I stop your crying? Please. [smooching] [sobbing] I've been assessing your claim and I refuse to admit liability. Under the terms of the policy, you have no cover. You're disqualified. We could talk about why it happened. This is your proposal to mitigate, is it? I still want our marriage to work, don't you? We took wedding vows! I meant them. I thought they were important. Look, for Amy's sake, Michael. [sobbing] I made a mistake! I made a mistake! I made a mistake! I can't live here anymore. I can't get my head around it. I can't see clear, I can't get a perspective on it. All I know is you're not what I thought! Don't you want to keep me? I can't. [distant radio chatter] Thank you. -Hello. -Hello. What can I do for you? You do recognise me, don't you? My son worked for your husband. You were at the funeral. I just came to see how you were and if there was anything I could do. I'm sure you and your husband have got your own worries. Oh, it's just business, that's all. It's, it's nothing really, it's okay. Mr. Candy's being very kind, anyway. It's the least he could do. [heavy footsteps] Well, thanks, but I think it's best if I look to myself from now on, anyway. I'm really, really sorry. [heavy footsteps] In the days leading up to the fire, did Danny appear edgy, nervous to you? No, he seemed quite content. A new girlfriend, job to go to. That's a funny thing, really. I mean, on the night of the fire, he was going out on a date with Holly, wasn't he? He looked smart when he went out. That's what I'm getting at. He's gone out on a date with his girlfriend. He's wearing nice clothes. Setting that fire seems to be the last thing in his mind. He had a row, him and Holly. I know and after that he breaks into a factory and just cause he's had a row with his girlfriend, and cause he's got a grudge against his employer no one seems to be aware of. Oh, I wish it made sense at all. Look, did Danny smoke. Mrs. Cole? [Mrs. Cole] No. Secretly, perhaps? Look, if you wanted to smoke, he wouldn't have care what I thought. How would he light them anyway? Sorry? They didn't find any ignition materials on him, Mrs. Cole. No trace of matches. No cigarette lighter. Well, no cigarettes. In other words, nothing to set the fire with. So how did he? What are you saying? Look, I might be overstepping. [Mrs. Cole] What are you saying? I'm saying he didn't. Are you saying you've got proof or that's what you think? The only thing that really suggests that Danny set that fire was the fact that he was found there. Is it somebody else? I think so. Oh, I wish it were true. I'm trying to prove it. Why should the real culprit get away with it, eh? The door was-- Well, this is a surprise. Yes. Mr. Ride's just been-- Making further inquiries. Actually, I'm through now. And what about me? When are you through with me? I've got to go. Look, what I said about Danny, that's just between you and me, all right? Well, I don't owe you anything, Mr. Ride, but owe him in there. And the people you represent owe him something as well, so why don't you just pay up? [rustling] [thudding] What was he asking? Oh, stuff about Danny. [clicking] How he was the night of the fire. The days before, how he was. What else? He doesn't think he did it, Frank. He says it doesn't add up. Look, Anita, I'd like to believe that, too. He didn't have a match. He didn't have anything. He had his best trousers on. Someone else, is that what he told you? Just because they found him there-- Who do you think he means, Anita? Who's the someone else? [distant baby crying] Well, he doesn't know yet. He means me. He's trying to say it was me or somebody connected with me. It's the only way he can disprove my claim, don't you see? He's throwing this shit around hoping it'll stick, hoping the police'll change their mind. You mustn't believe it, Anita. Then make me hopeful. You mustn't believe a word he said. I just want to believe that he was innocent. I know. [sobbing] Your wife came to see me today. What? At work. She said she was worried about me. If only she knew. We're not going to let her find out. Are we? Well, if you, if you just read this forensic report, it might make you think again. Does it come out conclusively and say the kid didn't start the fire? No, but it makes you ask yourself why the kid would hang around for almost an hour while the bloody thing smouldered. If you're looking for phantoms, Mr. Ride-- No, I'm looking for an arsonist! [distant radio chatter] You know who the local ones are. You know, if we could find a connection between one of them and the policy holder-- I tell you what, why don't you get Mr. Candy to confess? Then we're in business. I've got him and his bank screaming "if the police are happy, why aren't we?" And they're right. If the police are happy with their version of events, why are we letting you develop another one? To establish that he's in it up to his eyeballs. Yes, but you can't, can you? So we act in good faith and we settle. Let me have one more go. Let me have another tilt this afternoon. Oh, you think Frank Candy's going to break down and confess just because you've turned up again? Maybe somebody else will. Now, on the night of the fire, you were in bed beside him and when he got the phone call, obviously. And there seems to be some delay in him getting down there. Any reason you're aware of why that might be? He certainly left here in a hurry. Did he? Well, it was urgent, wasn't it? Well, because the factory was on fire. Of course. And he told you that? Yes, he got the phone call, didn't he? No, only to say the alarm had gone off. Nobody knew about the fire then. I mean, it was smouldering, but in secret as it were, nobody knew about it until the flashover, except your husband by the sounds of it. And the arsonist, of course. Maybe he didn't say that. Maybe he was just told about the alarm going off and I've...I don't remember it that well. Maybe you do remember him leaving here in a hurry, yeah? Look, I can't explain his delay in getting there. Haven't you asked him? Well, he said he didn't attach much priority to it. It was the third time he'd been called out in two weeks, but you said he acted like it was urgent. -Look. -And now I know knowledge of the fire, that would make it urgent, wouldn't it? Look, I said, I made a mistake. No, you didn't make a mistake! You husband made a mistake! Now, he knew about that fire, didn't he? That's why he was able to tell you what it was before anybody else knew what it was. I mean, he even put on a little show of urgency for you, but the last thing he wanted to do was get down there to prevent anything. It was going on, all right. But not like he thought. I mean, it was doing damage all right but not like he thought, 'cause a boy was caught in the middle of it. I think you've said enough. [Michael] The poor kid just went to investigate. Shut up. He didn't know that the fire your husband was responsible for always waiting to kill him. [Mrs. Candy] Shut up! Now, will you stop covering up for him! Shut up! Shut up, shut up! [rustling] It's all right, it's all right. He's just, he's just trying to upset me. Trying to get me to say something I can't say. -I can't or won't. -Can't. Get out of my house, get out! You've overstepped the mark, Ride, out! That's something you know about, isn't it? [rustling] [thuds] You didn't give me up. You'd never give yourself up. Acting the innocent. What you did, does it mean, does it mean you forgive? It means I was scared and that's my main feeling these days. [distant phone ringing] -Well. -Well, he's, he's hiding behind his wife, except that she's not very good at hiding. She was on the verge of implicating him. So what stopped her? She stopped herself. We're going to settle. Now look, that's-- That's business. Doubting the policy holder is one thing. But if that also means doubting the police, we pay up. The guy's a JP, to boot, and if he suffers a claim, we're not going to suffer bad publicity and a defamation suit by not settling it. He is responsible, -you know. -So. Well, it's wrong! Wrong, you're a loss adjuster. You assess cover, you adjust claims and try and disprove bad ones. If you can't, you get philosophical about it. You don't start mudging it up with morality. I suppose I better start helping him get back on his feet then. Yes, look, he may have had that fire set. He may be the biggest hypocrite you've ever met. He may be the reason the boy's dead and screwing the mother into the bargain. But you know the most important thing about Mr. Candy? He's paid his premiums. [rustling] [chiming] [creaking] They're going to settle. It's over. Not gonna be any more-- No more questions. they think it's a fair claim. They accept what happened. [distant bird cawing] God, if I could-- Anyhow, just thought I'd let you know. Frank... [engines whirring loudly] [distant singing] Are you looking for Mr. Candy? -Yes. -He's over there. Well, the pattern's pretty simple. You know, they actually thought they could get the same consistency with the synthetic as they could with real leather. Anyway, I want 60 and the rest of the leather's in the store room. Mrs. Cole. Anita by now, Frank, surely. We'll go to my office. Why did you come here? 'Cause I wanted to see you in your new factory. You shouldn't have come here. We shouldn't see each other here! Why not? I don't want it to matter. Oh, is that what you here, to prove something? I came here, Frank, because I'm interested in what's going on in your life. Isn't this the latest part of it? Your factory? What you can't stop talking about when you in my bedroom. All right, all right, all right. Anyway, I bet your wife can breeze in and out of here as she pleases. I'm your dirty little secret. No, you're not. Well, come clean, then...please. [rustling] You didn't say you were coming. To see Amy, Do I need to make an appointment or something? I just thought you might have rung. Where is she? [distant crying] Amy? Amy, it's Daddy! Pulled it away. Hello, who's this? A friend of mine. Oh, what, the friend? Is it the friend, eh, come here, darling. Come to me. I don't want a scene, okay? A scene! You told me it was over and then I find him on my sofa with my daughter. That's a scene and a half, isn't it! Look, we started talking again. Started sorting stuff out. Oh, what giving each other another chance, are we? Not something you believe in, is it, another chance? Look, none of this is a good idea in front of your daughter. Paul's right. Oh, he's right, is he? Hey, he's telling me how to behave in my house and Paul's right, is he? What you screw him, let him get cosy with my daughter and he's right? This is right? [screaming] Is this right, you bitch? This is right? [crashing] Don't look at me like that, darling! I'm not the one! [scraping] [snickers] I bought a book about fire. There's a chapter on how people behave in one. People have been known to run a bath of the water and sit in it hoping the fire wouldn't get to them. They get lost in their own front rooms. Can't find a way out for the smoke. Everything in this whole thing is new. [water dripping] They just lose. We've got out, haven't we? [crinkling] [thudding] [rustling] -Stay. -I can't. -Just be late. -I'm already late. I've got to get this log on. Attend another function. I don't do like it, Anita. I can't help it. That's the life I've got at the moment. At the moment. [rustling] [giggling] You'll do. I want the truth to come out. It's just hard. [soft footsteps] [distant barking] [clicking] [Speaker] If we've learned anything from the pressure and the stress... Frank will turn up, won't he? [Speaker] It's just the confidence-- He had to work late a bit. Did he? Exactly. [clicking] -Must be... -Sorry, it's just the empty chair's a bit spooky, for obvious reasons. I don't believe in ghosts around. Anyway, look. We must question the way we do business. In the very act of survival, other considerations can often be put aside. Moral, ethical ones. And the public perception of standards in public and professional life has never been lower. We must be vigilant not to put aside the dignity of our professions. If we do, the very foundation on which we stand falls away and nothing we do, public or personal, has any value. [Michael] Amy, Amy! She doesn't want to go out with you! What have you been saying to her? I've been trying to persuade her! I don't believe you! That doesn't surprise me. How could you take my word for anything anymore? No, I want to go see her! You can't. You're prevented, remember? You can't prevent me from seeing her! She gets no pleasure from being with you, Michael. That's why she's up at that window. That's why she hasn't run down to kiss you. Maybe she's scared she's gonna disappoint you. Amy! [thudding] [distant barking] Amy! [soft rustling] [soft footsteps] Hello, Mrs. Candy. Have you got a minute? Why? I just never got a chance to thank you for your cooperation on the claim. Is that it? You must be very proud. Of the way you're cooperated. [exhales heavily] Look, this isn't a terribly professional, but if you just bear with me. You see, when an insurer undertakes to cover the risk of someone like your husband and someone like your husband is supposed to observe what we call a doctrine of utmost good faith. In other words, before an insurance company will enter into a contract with him, everything material should be truthfully represented and nothing should be withheld. [bird cawing] A trust, basically. Like in any good relationship. Like in a marriage, like yours. My marriage is my business. Mine and my husband's. You're actin' in good faith, aren't ya'? Trouble is, there's a third party, you see. You could ask me to leave now, if you want, I'll go. You like to say things, you, don't you? You like to make thing up. I never make anything up. I'm just not too keen on people that do. Especially if you think they're getting away with it. Well, he's gettin' away with it! It's the dead boy's mother, for Christ's sake! Prove it. I can. This time I can. You want me to show you? You're going to have to, aren't you? [softly scoffs] [chirping] [thuds] [rustling] He was going to a function with you, wasn't he? This isn't your job. And he turned up late, didn't he? This isn't what you're supposed to do. Why did he say he was late? You're not supposed to follow him around. You're not supposed to hide yourself. And he's not supposed to cheat on you, is he! You defended him. Defended him in the name of a marriage you've barely got. You still want to cooperate for him? [rustling] You can take them back. It's getting harder and harder for him to hide what he is, you know. Don't help him. Can you go now please? I didn't expect you... But you know now, don't you? When you know, you know you can't stop being a fraud. Good bye, Mr. Ride. What are you going to do, Lynne? [crashing] [shattering] [thudding] [metallic thud] [metallic tinking] [crashing] [crashing] We're in it, all right, aren't we? The eternal triangle. Only this one's got four sides. Ride's been following you around. Oh, he's been very thorough. Candid camera. Ride? The last time he came to see me, I put up a show for you. I lied to him for you. Then he comes back and shows me what you've been doing. This time, I can't put up a show. -I know. -No. I know. What kind of man are you? Her son's dead because of you and now you're screwing his mother. Haven't you screwed her enough already? She loves me. Oh, she loves you. Now, which you is that she loves? The you that didn't kill her son? I just wanted to be...kind. I wanted to be well thought of by her. Tell her about Danny. See what's left then. See what's left! [sobbing] [thuds] [thuds] [heavy footsteps] [ringing] [pounding] Has he been here? Who? Ride, has he tried to contact you? Has he rung yet? No, what's wrong? Promise me something, promise me! What are you talking about? Don't speak to him! Don't let him speak to you! Not unless I'm with you. He seems to know about you and me. He's told Lynne. Why? He's just told her. Well then there's nothing to worry about anymore, is there? Is there? No. [smooches] [distant shouting] He's been harassing my wife. He's visited the factory uninvited. He has no business being anywhere near us anymore. What the hell does he think he's up? Your guess is as good as mine. Now, what's that's supposed to mean? You employ him! He walked. In the aftermath of your claim, actually...disillusioned. I tried to dissuade him, but once he gets an idea in his head-- He doesn't work here anymore? Where is he? Working for himself now, by the sound of it. [distant ringing] [rustling] Is your husband in? He, he doesn't live here anymore. Oh really? Yes, really, we're separated. And do you know where he's living? What's this about? It's about his conduct, actually! Is this work? I'm trying to work! Make it legal. I am. [thuds] I heard him banging on the door. His wife's found out. That'll be the end of your little fling, then. Will it? They always go back to their wife. Is that what you'd like to see? -Hey. -Well then we'll both be the same again, won't we? Lonely and expecting nothing. What are you expecting, then? Something good to keep happening to me. Something bloody good! You should have just gone bankrupt. Think of what you would have saved. Does she know yet? Maybe you want to tell her. But you couldn't, could you? Because you've known all along. You've kept quiet all along and even though I've been unfaithful to you, we've both been unfaithful to her. [zipping] [distant barking] [thuds] No, I was gonna walk away. Just get out of the way. And then I thought everybody else does that, don't they? You know, avoid, evade...backslide. But I told your wife, Frank, about your indiscretion. I just came to see how it was turning out. You don't get it, do you? [Michael] Get what? I wanted it to come out. I'm glad about it. And is she glad? Oh, not as glad as your wife! What are you talking about? What's my wife gotta do with you? I've been to your house, too. I know! I've been to your office. You don't belong there either, do you! You're nowhere! You've got nothing! You thought you could hurt me! I'm doing fine in comparison to you! I thought you didn't walk away! That's a real skill you've acquired. What? Gettin' rid of people. [engine churning] [loud showering] Pleased to see me? [rustling] [thuds] [rushing traffic] -Good night. -Good night. [engine revving] [heavy footsteps] Would you like a hand with that? No, fool, not you. Danny was innocent. Your son didn't do it, Mrs. Cole. Look, I know what was coming next. So you might as well just save it, all right. So how's the new man in your life? Must be feeling pretty spooked. I mean, he can leave his wife, but I won't go away. He's not scared of you. He's got nothing to be scared of. Is that how he was when he told you not to talk to me? Then was he calm? Was he in control? I exposed the hypocritical bastard to his wife, but that's nothing compared to how he's deceiving you. We live under the same roof now, me and him. The same roof. But that means nothing! Even if you go home tonight and cook his tea and climb on top of him afterwards, it won't change one simple fact. He was responsible for the fire. His business was on the ropes and he had the fire set. Well, the police-- The police have been happy to blame your son! And so is Frank, hasn't he, eh? Look at him, he's due, he doesn't feel too good about it. That's why he's being so solicitous to you. That's why he was at the inquest. He's gone to such lengths to secure his conscience. He's even moved in with you. But he hasn't done the one thing he should do. He hasn't owned up to the fact that your son is dead because of him. That can't be true. None of it. [Michael] Why not? Because I love him. Just ask him. [loud chattering] [distant thumping music] [heavy footsteps] -Good night. -Good night. Frank, is it? Yeah. [distant chattering] And hopefully we should have the whole consignment shipped out to you in about 10 days. No, I won't let you down on that. You've got my word. Okay, bye. I was just about to, you know, come home. [thudding] Can I have it? What? You said on the phone. You've got my word. It's obviously something you pride yourself on. Can I have it? My word? That you didn't cause the fire. That Danny didn't die because your business was failing. We had some problems, all businesses do. Give me your word. Has Ride been to see you? Give me a word. When our bags leave here, they've been examined four times. During construction, afterwards, it's standards, you know. Our quality control is, I have very high standards. I have standards, Anita, but something got through. I had to let through. Fire. Danny wasn't supposed to be there. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And you let the police think he had a grudge against you. I didn't disagree. And you kept coming around to me. [groans] Such pity you took. I meant it. I wanted to do anything I could. You could have cleared his name. Once I started lying, I had to keep going. I had the fire set to survive. I had to keep on surviving. Yeah, now you're thriving. And you got me to fall in love with you. Oh, I understand Ride now. The way we've seen you get your story straight. The way it's turned out. I hate what I've done to you. I love you. Go to the police if you want. They don't resurrect the dead. You could. -His name, anyway. -And bury yours. If you want nothing more to do with me, I'm buried anyhow. Who else knows? -Lynne. -Hmm. She was gonna stand by you, was she? I wanted you. [rustling] I wanted you! [rustling] You knew about Danny. You knew what Frank had done. [thudding] [pounding] I want to talk to you! [pounding] I want to talk to you! [pounding] [loud chirping] [heavy footsteps] [rustling] I'm here. It's funny, I always thought I'd be the one to avoid you. That you'd be the one who came looking for me and I'd be made to feel sorry for what I'd taken away from you. I didn't know what Frank had done till afterwards. But you lived with it. -Not very well. -Well enough. He was my husband. It's hard to let go. You try and hang on. Weren't you trying just as hard to take him, to have him? That was before I knew. Before I knew-- Oh, and it was all right before you knew. It was all right to act like you did. It was all right to go screwing someone else's husband! He left me and you got everything you wanted. I was entitled! To him? I brought my son up on my own! When was the last time anybody showed any interest in me? Any affection for me? I have nobody. How much thought did you give to me? You've had years of love...years. And now you're angry. Because after all you try and you're still not going to have any, are you? I was looking forward to it. [scoffs] Frank thinks you can save him. The stupid fool's got it all wrong. You're not good enough to save anybody, are you? [thudding] [metallic scraping] Prefer to be here today, Frank? Staring at the ruins, eh? You think I'm going to break down and confess my sins to you? All my transgressions. You don't have to. Look how passive you are. You haven't thrown yourself at me. There's no fist in me face. You haven't even shouted. You've given up the fight, really, haven't you? I still have my business, Ride. [scoffs] Well, you won't be able to run it soon, eh. You won't have the wherewithal. You don't mind, really, do you? You know about a 10th of what you think you do. I've done everything I can to screw up your life. You could have gone to the police and had an injunction against me, but you didn't. You could have got them to stop me from going anywhere near you or yours, but you didn't. Oh, you could have tried harder, Frank. You're a magistrate, I mean, you know the score. But you didn't stop me screwing up your life because it's what you wanted, really, wasn't it? Eh, that's what you think you deserve really, isn't it? There's only one person who can decide what I deserve and it's not me and it's certainly not you. You bastard, you. She's already decided, Frank. Otherwise you wouldn't be here, would you? [crashing] [laughing] Look at you, Frank, eh! You're covered in shit! You were full of it, Frank, and now it's all over you fucking suit for everyone to see! [chuckling] What do people see when they look at you, Ride? Me...there should be more people like me! I'm like you! I went too far because I wanted things to turn out right! I'm like you! That's a confession, Frank! That's a confession. [scoffs] [metallic clanging] [thudding] [clicking] [rustling] [thuds] [crinkling] They let me off work early. I asked to go early. They let me. The man who set the fire, how did you get to meet him? He was up before me...arson. Not guilty, technically, just like me. How did you pay him? Half and half. What do you wanna know details for, Anita? A judge likes all the evidence. Was it half the money after the fire? How did you feel giving him the money when you knew Danny was dead? How do you think? [Anita] But you still paid him. I had to. Was he sorry? Not really. Well didn't you try and make him sorry? [Frank] How could I? Didn't you even try, Frank? What did you do, Frank? Did you just hand over the rest of the money and have a chat about what went wrong? I can't change anything I did, Anita! And what did he do with the money you gave him, Frank? Did he have a nice holiday? Did he buy a decent car? [loud showering] What could I have done? What should I have done? You're all full of your laws, Frank, but you made sure nobody knew about it! I came to you! I'm done with ya'! Try the police! Anita, you won! [distant thundering] [groaning] Frank? You can go back in now. Go back in! I know the way there. [rustling] [thundering] I know the way, I know the way, I know the way! [hard showering] Your wife thinks I'm not good enough to save you. You're better than me. He gave me something. I was going to take it. I saw, oh Christ, I saw. It wasn't just penance, was it? No. Danny's dead, I could say goodbye to you and all. I'm sick of grief. I'm sick of it. Let's just live. [scoffs] Thank you. You could keep the house, you know. The less kept of you, the better. [soft scraping] Your own woman. Not yet. What's happened with you and her? Well, we're okay. You are? She must really want to save you. What am I supposed to do, let her? Let you both get on with it? What are you going to do? Do you know something, Frank? I've come to realise how full of admiration I am for Ride. Completely uncompromising where the truth's concerned, isn't he? [thudding] What are you gonna do? [distant music] [machines whirring] [heavy footsteps] [rattling] [soft rattling] [ringing] [distant engine puttering] Forgot my key. [rattling] [metallic splashing] [thuds] [cork popping] [tinkling] Don't expect this every night. Every night? More? I don't think we're going to get away with many more nights, Anita. What are you talking about? Lynne. [crashing] [sirens blaring] [beeping] [chattering] [crashing] [sirens blaring] [beeping] [heavy footsteps] I'm sorry, after all this trouble. You and me both, eh? [sirens blaring] [splashing] [crackling] [exhales heavily] [ringing] [heavy footsteps] [sirens blaring] [splashing] Hello? [distant chattering] Frank! Factory alarm's gone off. [siren blaring] [splashing] [electronic chirping] [rustling] [scratching] [sirens blaring] [roaring] [ringing] [engine revving] [crackling] [roaring] Come on. [ringing] [coughing] Come on! [honking] [screeching] [crashing] [ringing] [sirens blaring] [squealing] [thudding] Prompt, Frank! Very prompt, eh, not like last time! Must have not wanted it to burn this time, eh, bastard! You bastard! [laughing] [ringing] [sirens blaring] That's your man, there! Go get him! Go get your man, that's your man there! What, do you think I set the fire just for the hell of it? You tell me. You know I wanted you to investigate the other fire more fully. That I tried to convince you it was suspicious. I thought this was lead your back to it, that's all. So you were sneaking around with a can of petrol in the cause of justice, were you? Well, it takes some obvious clues to make you look, pull your finger off, doesn't it, eh, hmm? Why do you think I used petrol and three seats of fire? I think you were just as happy to see the place burned down, weren't you? To destroy it. Just malice in the end, wasn't it? I don't think so. A little desperate, maybe, to see him answer more questions about the circumstances in which a boy died! Christ, am I the only person that's interested in that? Is that malice? We're gonna charge you. No, I'm not a criminal! You are now. I'm not a criminal! Several times in the past few weeks, he's approached me and made allegations about Frank Candy being responsible for my son's death. Well, apart from that being distressing in itself, it's just crazy. I mean, would I choose to live with him if I'd thought he'd done that? He has a bee in his bonnet about the insurance company settling my claim. He's been harassing me ever since. Why didn't you make a complaint? I thought he'd stop. I understand you live with the dead boy's mother, Mr. Candy. Yes. Well, he's got this version of events in his head. It's pretty incredible, but between you and me, I think he's deranged. I think so, too. [echoing footsteps] [soft chattering] [clicking] [ringing] [echoing footsteps] We'll be with you in just a sec, all right? Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Candy. Thanks for coming in. [echoing clicking] Why are you here? Ride, he tried to set fire to the factory. [scoffing] I know how he feels. What have you come here for? Yes, madame. I'm not sure that it's worth reporting, really. Why don't you let me be the judge of that. I'm sorry. I...I'd just be wasting everybody's time. Bye bye...I'm sorry. [echoing footsteps] [loud showering] Lynne! You could have set a match to both of us. I hope you're grateful. You're letting me go. No...I'm letting go. I didn't do it for you. I did it for me and Ginny and all the other people that work for you because the big difference is they need you. Be good. [soft showering] [engine revving] [banging] [sombre music]
