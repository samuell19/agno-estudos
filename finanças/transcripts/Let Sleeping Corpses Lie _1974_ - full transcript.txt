That'll be three quid, Miss. - Sorry. How much? - Three pounds, please. Thank you. Give us a fill-up. I'm so sorry. I must be a little tired. I put it into reverse. Yes, I can see that. Of course I'm insured. And whatever expense... Of course, darling. After all, it could have been worse. - Couldn't it? - Yes. There's even a garage. How long will it take? Well, you'll need a new wheel. We'll have to get that from Glasgow. And it's the weekend. Earliest will be Monday evening. Okay, it's yours. I'll see you on Monday then. And don't bugger me about. Are you going to Windermere? Not into the town exactly. Nearby. Well, you'll take me there just the same, won't you? It's the least you could do. Right? I'll drive. I mean, we don't want to go all the way in reverse, do we? Actually, you'll be doing me a favor. You see, I've driven all the way from London, and I do feel a little tired. Then go to sleep. Thank you. Aren't you taking a lot for granted? Look, darling, you don't have to worry. I mean, I'm not gonna jump you or something. The name's George. And I'm Edna Simmon. Hmm. You look a little like an Edna. You up from London for the weekend? More or less. My sister has a cottage near here at Southgate. Hmm. It is a warning against hysteria when confronted by ecological problems, many of which have been exaggerated. And this so-called Project for Survival by Goldsmith and Allen has been signed by 33 English scientists, among them Julian Huxley. What rot. Ecological problems exaggerated. You know, of course, when we all die, only the scientists will survive. Oh, charming. What's so important about Windermere? A girl? Beautiful country, low industry... and an isolated little house all mine... where from Saturday to Monday I'll listen to the grass grow. Very restful. Stop! Please. Listen. I must be in Southgate this evening. And if I take you to Windermere, I'll be late. What's so important about Southgate? A man? Oh, no. - I have to see my sister before... - Before what? Look, I have a suggestion. Take me there. Keep the car to go to Windermere, and I'll send someone for it. Oh, then I'll be late. Look, the house is new. And I have an appointment with some friends to fix it up... Oh, please! Okay. Show me the way. I've only been there once. I remember a stream, but all these country roads look alike. Well, there's a stream all right, but the road ends here. Hang on a sec. I'll go and ask. Hey, what are you doing with the key? Why? Not that I don't trust you, but I really can't risk your leaving me here on foot, can I? Don't get your knickers in a twist. I'll be back soon. George! Ask for the Madison's house. Hello? Anyone around? There. For the prescribed area, keep it on an emission of 17 megahertz. Try it. Right. Ta very much. Excuse me. The road to the Madison's place? Hang on a second. I'll show you. Now, before you lower it, I'll just adjust the cycle convergence. All right. - Okay, sir, let's give it a whirl. - What is this thing? It's supposed to destroy insects and parasites. It was sent by the Department of Agriculture. It's still experimental. I'd send it right back where it came from And keep the insects and parasites nature's given you. What are you talking about? Just another machine to pollute the earth. Till now, at least, this part of the country's been left alone. What do you mean, "pollute the earth"? We're here to demonstrate to the growers just the opposite. And they're all agreed. I've got their signatures here in me pocket. This works solely by ultrasonic radiation. There's not a chemical involved. You're quite right, sir. If you don't like progress, those two's the wrong two to talk to. Now where was it you wanted to go to? Oh, the Madison place. Yeah, you go over that hill, and on the right there's a big oak. Then you follow the old ridge, and it's the first... second... No, the third gate... Oh, come along with it, fella. I'm used to traffic lights. Let's have it over again. Oh, all right. Up from London, are ya? I should've known. Don't see too many young fellas dressed like you round here. Anyway, if you hang on, I'll go and put this thing down. All right, Bernard, let's have another bash at the main rotator. Right. Well? No, nothing yet. Hey, you did it. Go back along the road on to the side of the river. I'm sure you know a river when you see one. George! George! George! That man, he's following me! He tried to attack me! Sorry, love, but I can't see anyone. No, there was someone there. Back there. He was horrible! Are you certain? He was very tall w-w... with black hair and a black suit. And... And his clothes were wet as if... as if... he'd just come out of the water. You're wet too. I fell into the water when I was running away. Hey, don't be fright. Must have been Guthrie, the loony. - Who's that then? - No, I was only joking. Old Guthrie's dead. He were a tramp. He used to sleep down there by the river. And then about a week ago he drownded hisself. It seems to have been a suicide. And now he's a ghost. I'm sure he wanted to kill me. He tried to get into the car! Well, it must have been another tramp then, trying to get some money out of you. Old Guthrie used to do that, too, to every car that come along, eh? Come on now, darling. You were sitting there all alone, and he frightened you. That's all. It was getting dark. More natural. Come on. I found out how to get to your sister's house. Thank you. Bye. Katie? Strawberries, Martin. I wanted to bake a pie to celebrate my sister's visit. Finished, are you? Can I go now? It's hard for me too. You must understand, Katie. I know you're making life impossible for me. First you keep me here, like a prisoner, for a year. And now, I know why you asked my sister to come here. You didn't think I did, huh? I know where you want to send me. But I'll never go there! Do you hear me? Never! We'll do what you want. Now please get hold of yourself. Come on, darling. I'm going to set up the camera and flashes for the last series of pictures. Come straight back. Will you be all right alone? Will you be all right? Do you believe that, about the tramp, or... - Or what? - Or what I told you? I'm not mad, you know. I... I don't imagine things. Methinks the lady doth protest too much. What? I resent that. Listen, love, you have already ruined enough of my day. Do you want to fight now? Jesus. You made me lose the way. Now, how in the hell am I going to find this bloody place? Is that you, Martin? Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin! Martin! Help me, Martin! Help! Help! Help! Katie! Katie! Katie, what happened? - What happened? Where's Martin? - There, by the stream. It's all right. It's all right. Never seen anything like it. Somebody certainly enjoyed themselves here. - A sadist, huh? - Or a lunatic. And enormously strong. His whole torsoâ€™s been caved in. Every bone smashed. Have you notified headquarters yet? Yes, Sarge, but they're awfully busy this morning. Can't send anyone before teatime. Button up, man. You're wearing a uniform, not a pair of pajamas. Now look here, Sergeant. I've got other things to do. You can't keep me here all day. I've told you, I've got nothing to do with this. When there's been a murder, it's a funny thing, you know, but nobody ever has anything to do with it. I tell you, I didn't even know the man. I'm here by chance! Continue the interrogation, Benson. Maybe we can find out what "chance" means. All right, yes. No one's seen or heard anything? Any witnesses? Anything to go on? No. It was foggy, Sergeant. Um, but we've been told... Well, there's this farmer who lives about a mile from here, and he says there was bad blood between the husband and wife. A couple of times he saw 'em fighting. - Bring him in for questionin'. - Yes, Sergeant. Well? She's very consistent. She insists it was a man dressed in black. Very tall and well built. It was the same man who tried to attack me. I saw him. Yes, and you're the only ones. But of course I saw him. Why would I invent such a thing? Why? It's very simple, Miss. To back up your sister's story. That's why. Come on. Everything's going to be all right. Come on, Katie. Drink your tea. It'll do you good. Everything will be all right. Come on now. Drink up. Nothing to be frightened of. Now, Mrs. West, you were alone when your husband was killed. It wasn't the first time you had a fight, was it? Could you tell us what these pictures are all about? I don't know. I can't remember. But how... how can you think... You saw what happened to Martin. Only a very strong man could... Heroin. Now, Miss Simon, you must be aware that under the influence of drugs, an individual can do things that otherwise are beyond... the reach of his normal powers, and perhaps not even remember what he's done. Just as your sister here doesn't seem to remember anything about these photographs. You took a shot last night, didn't you? Come on. Admit it! But this is monstrous. What possible motive could Katie have had to want to kill Martin? Because after having kept her here for a year to get her off the stuff, and after becoming aware that she was still an addict, Martin decided to put her into a clinic. Isn't that why you came down here from London? Yes, that's true, but... - And you didn't want to go, did you? - No, I didn't want to go! In hospital, you wouldn't have been able to get any of this lovely stuff, now, would you? - But I didn't kill him! I didn't! - Excuse me, uh... What is it? Sorry, but he says he's got something very important to tell you. It's about time. Let's hear it. - You can come in. - Thanks. Well, it's like this, see? I came up here yesterday to see my friends. Well? Well, can't you see? I've got nothing to do with this. I've got my house to look after. Will you tell him... Listen, boy. You keep getting on my nerves, and I'm gonna give you another kind of house to look after, ...one with lots of bars in the windows! All right, all right! Take it easy. Don't get hysterical. We'll pick this up again later. I'm finished with you. And with you too, Miss. - For the moment. - Don't worry, Katie. There's a hotel in Southgate. You can both book rooms there until you hear from me. But I want to stay with my sister. Sorry, Miss. You must stay in the hotel. There must be a way to get her out of this. Yeah, a good London barrister. You think the police are right? Never, especially not him. The camera. Of course. Katie said that as she was being followed, the camera was taking pictures. There may be a photograph of the man. Come on. Let's tell the sergeant. Wait. You see that cop by the Mini? Yes. Ask him for a light. - Why? - Go on! I'm gonna do that bloody Irishman. Excuse me. Do you have a light? No, I'm sorry, Miss. Never carry matches. Haven't smoked in years, you know. Worst luck. What do you mean? Well, Miss, you see, when I smoked, I was as thin as a rail. But now, well... You could always start up again. I might do that one day. I wish I could stop smoking. Thanks anyway. You're welcome, Miss. Would you mind telling me what you're up to? Better we have it developed ourselves. - Why? - A little imbroglio, darling. The cops never like to admit they're wrong. - Craig. - Yes, Sergeant. - It's going to take ages, isn't it? - Nope. He does them himself. He said they'll be ready by noon. I've asked him to blow 'em up too. For a man in love with solitude, which you say you are, this does look like the perfect place. Wouldn't you agree? Do me a favor, darling. Don't try to be funny, all right? We're in this mess together, aren't we? Good morning. It won't bite. You see, it's trained. Can I help you? Have you got any rooms? Would you go into the bar, please? Got two rooms? I guess that must cost less than a double, right? - What do you mean by that? - Nothing. It's just that we need the rooms to rest in, nothing more. This is a respectable place, I'll have you know. Yes, yes, I can tell. I intend to spend as little time in it as possible. Where can I make a phone call? Out there, under the stairs. You wouldn't be the people involved in the murder, would you? Why? Message for you. Yes, I know I was supposed to arrive yesterday, but I've been delayed by an accident. And I'm here just a few miles away. Anyway, wait for me, and I'll be there as soon as I can. Of course I'll be there. Just a few things to finish up. Okay? - George. George! - I gotta go. Bye. Katie's had a breakdown. The police just phoned. They're putting her in the local hospital. Listen, we must go there. - But I've got things to do. I've just... - Please, I can't even think anymore. You must help me. I'm Mrs. West's sister. Is it serious, Doctor? No. She's coming round now. Oh, she needs rest. Please, don't tire her. I didn't do it, Edna. Want one? They're perfect for the long voyage home. No, thank you. What do you mean by "the long voyage home"? A touch of inside humor, I'm afraid. A little macabre, I know. You see, from here to Manchester, it's quite a way to go in a freezer unit. Yes, all the autopsies and examinations and tests on various organs are done in Manchester. Quite a few people leave their bodies to science these days. How about it, young man? Shall I make a reservation for you? Oh, no. It's the nursery again. Nurse Jones! Nurse Jones! Quick, look after her, will you? Nurse Jones. My God, where is everyone? My God. My God. It blinded me! Oh, my goodness. What a nasty looking cut. Come along with me, Nurse. - Well, here, you can help. - All right, Doctor. Will you hold it still? It's happened again. - Are you hurt? - No, but it tried its hardest. - Hmm. - What the hell is wrong with it? We don't know. It's the third one born since yesterday with an incredible aggressiveness. Almost, well, homicidal in its intensity. - Uh, some sort of virus? - No. We've done every sort of test. It's very strange. All the children come from the same area around Southgate. Near the river. We tested the water too. - Hmm, that's curious. - What is? Well, there's a farm over there where they've set up some sort of machine to destroy insects by means of ultrasonic rays or something. I thought perhaps... You know. How interesting. I'd like to have a look at it. Do you think you could show me where it is? You can see, Doctor, the radiation works on the insect's nervous system. It drives them mad, and they attack one another. I think we're gonna see a real revolution in agriculture. Not even DDT was this effective when it first came out. DDT causes cancer. How 'bout this? Now, listen, you've been on our back since last night. Now, if you want to go back to nature, why don't you find yourself a nice Pacific atoll somewhere... Sure. All I'd have to worry about then is atomic fallout. Thanks awfully, old chap. - What's the range of this machine? - Oh, about a mile at present. We're trying to perfect one up to five miles. But of course this can't have anything to do with the children, now, could it? It's absurd! Now, Doctor, you're a man of science. Surely you can understand this machine has undergone the most stringent testing. The radiation only affects the most primitive forms of nervous systems, like microbes and insects. It has no effect on more evolved systems, such as human ones. It's completely harmless. How can you be certain? Look, do I look like I'm about to attack you? And I'm surrounded by radiation. Now, it's all right. I understand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, perhaps they're right. It's not the answer. I'm afraid not. Still, you know, a newborn child's nervous system is still in a very elementary state. Well, if you have any doubts, why don't you do something? Make some noise, insist on more tests? It's never wise to exaggerate. We can't even get the government to act on much more serious and concrete facts these days. Imagine what success we'll have getting anyone to do anything on a mere hypothesis. I'm afraid they'd laugh at us. I don't understand. You can only see Katie. But look at her. Doesn't it seem as if someone or something's after her? Mm-hmm. It's a good thing the police haven't seen this one. She really looks as if she's about to do him in. So you think she's guilty too. But I tell you, the man exists. I saw him! Listen, you knew him. I mean, that tramp we heard about, the one who drowned last week. - Oh, Guthrie. - Yes! - Of course. Why? - Do you have a picture of him or anything? - Look, I know it sounds silly, but is it possible... I mean, could a film fail to catch an image for any reason? Well, a ghost, maybe. No one believes in ghosts anymore, including the police. You see, we're not quite as stupid as you seem to think we are. Ah, very interesting. Now I can see why you wanted to keep this roll of film. Look, she had nothing to do with it. It was my idea. Of course. You're all in it together. Aiding and abetting a suspect, withholding information. You and your bird here will have to answer for it at the inquest. I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that you fellas could just possibly be barking up the wrong tree. Not when dealing with people like you. You're all the same, the lot of you, with your long hair and faggot clothes, drugs, sex, every sort of filth. And you hate the police. - Don't ya? - You make it easy. See you at the inquest. And, uh, don't get any ideas about not being there. Heil Hitler. We've got ourselves into enough hot water for today. Let's get back to the hotel. You're off about? Who's paying for the pictures? That'll be two quid. - Here you are. Thanks for your trouble. - It was nothing, Miss. Oh, by the way, you wanted Guthrie's picture. There's one here in Monday's paper... taken right after they took him out of the water. Oh, my God! George. - What is it? - It's him! - The man I saw, the one who killed Martin! - But that's absurd. The man's dead. - But I tell you, it's him! - Look, love, use your head. He died last week and Martin was killed last night. George, I tell you, that is the man, and his clothes were all wet. He looked exactly like someone who drowned. Listen, are you certain he's dead? I mean, was there a death certificate? Oh, sure. I was there when they put him in the coffin. And two days ago we took him to the cemetery. No one wanted to bury him because he didn't have any money. In fact, they didn't even want him to be cremated. It's all there in the paper. You read it. Then he must have a twin brother, that's all. Thanks a lot. - What are we going to do now? - Get in. Craig! They're up to something. Follow them and keep me up to date. - Yes, Sergeant. - Wait, wait. - Better take my car. - Oh, all right. Where are we going? To the only place where I can cure you of your fancy hallucinations. Here we are. George. Wait a minute. If the man is dead, he must be here, right? We'll find out if he's here, okay? If he is here, then I want you to knock it off about seeing a man in black and all that rot, because, love, the dead don't walk around, except in very bad paperback novels. They're dead, and that's that. Do we agree? If you say so. Anyone about? All right. Let's try in there. Hello? Anyone at home? Hello? Let's go. There's no one here. No, wait a minute. Maybe this Guthrie's in one of these. "Mary Duggan" Hello, darling. Who are you? "Edward Keith." "Guthrie Wilson." Here he is. George, let's go. What the... Hey! You've shut us in! Hey! Let us out! Let us out! George! George! Stop! I don't believe it. Get up that ladder as fast as you can! Move! George! George! Get out! Get out! Hurry! Help! Help! - Craig here. - Have you found 'em yet? Yes, Sergeant. They're in the cemetery. The cemetery? What the hell are they doing in there? I don't know, Sarge. I was just gonna go and have a look. George! Strewth! Give us your hand. Let's get out of here, quick! What the devil's happening here? Would you please explain? Get inside, quickly! Get inside! Quickly! Go on! Go on! Christ! There's no way out. That's useless. Come on. Help me. They're... They're dead, aren't they? Yeah. But don't ask me, 'cause I haven't the foggiest. Christ only knows what brought them back to life again. Oh, God. I think I do know. The radiation! Of course. It worked on the babies' nervous system. Why not on those of the dead? What the hell are you raving about, man? Craig, when a person dies, perhaps the nervous system goes on living for a while. Perhaps in some very basic, crude way, like an insect's. Or a plant. Look, you can pick a flower, but it goes on living for a while. You're right. That man Guthrie, didn't he die when they began the experiment? Well, all right. He was the first, but the others... They transmit life to each other through the blood of the living. Like a plague. That's why they kill. Now you know who it was that killed Martin. I can just imagine the sergeant's face when he finds out. I'd like to be there when he does. If we get out of this alive. Let's reinforce that door. Take the lamp! This won't hold very long. We've got to find a way to defend ourselves. What with? Silver bullets or a wooden stake? Oh! My radio... It's the sergeant trying to get through. I must have left it near that hole outside. If I could just get to it, or get to the car, I could call for help. Craig, can you hear me? What the Christ has happened to the lazy bastard? Ah, he turned his set off. Craig, can you hear me? The coroner's just completed his examination, Sergeant. - Will you drive him back? - Yes. I sent a man to trail two suspects, but I don't get any answer. It's funny. I'll send you an ambulance. Take the body to the hospital. We'll have to have an autopsy. Help me to move this. I'm gonna get the radio. Craig, it's madness! You'll never make it. It's our only chance. Okay. Maybe you'll think better of the police if I can pull this off. Good luck, man. Sergeant, this is Craig reporting at the cemetery. There are dead people trying to kill me! No! - Christ, we've got to get out of here. - No, George. I'm afraid. What difference does that make? Come. You take the Mini back to the cottage and tell the police what's happened. - What about you? - I'm gonna fix that bloody machine. Come on. It's all over with now. There's no more danger. And Martin, his body's still back there. The radiation could... No. They only have a range of a mile or so. The cottage is at least three or four miles away. Go on now. I'll wait for you at the farm. Edna! Edna! - It was the machine! You've gotta stop it. - What are you doing? Wait. Wait. Now, look. Wait! Listen! You talk about the dead walkin', about cannibalism. It's unscientific, man. Lots of things are unscientific, but they happen just the same. - Turn off that goddamn machine! - Get along there. Aye. It runs like a charm, laddie. It's killed every bloody insect round here, except for you. And we got the range up to five miles now. Five miles? - Aye, five bloody miles. - Since when? - A little while ago. - Just before you got here. Hold him! And stop him! Stop him. Hey, what do you think you're doing? I'm gonna have to call the police, you know. Right! Bernard, what are you doing on the ground? He's broken our oscilloscope. I'll go for the police. No, don't chase him again, Clive. Come on, Bernard... Hey! Wait! Stop! I've got to get to the Madison's place! Hey, wait! Wait! We have to burn the corpse! Don't you understand? There's not a moment to lose! Come back! We're all in danger! Well? She had any calls from her sister or that man? - Nothing at all. - Thank you. No, Sergeant. No one's seen them, and they haven't called. Phone headquarters for reinforcements and search for them. Make a house-to-house and scour the countryside. And arm the men. They killed Craig and the caretaker, so if they resist, shoot to kill. Poor Craig. If you'd only had time to notify us. The thing I don't understand is the difference in the bodies. Those have been horribly mutilated, whereas those look like they were intact. What the hell did they burn the bodies for? That's what I wanna know. Couple of drug-crazy maniacs. Oh, worse than that, Sergeant. Have you ever come across any of these Satanists in your investigations? No, but I've heard about them. Y-You don't think... They vandalize cemeteries. They profane tombs and, you know, hold black masses. That's why you've got your cross. It looks to me like a pretty typical case. Now, if I could only get me hands on them. Oh, Sergeant. That madman went to a nearby farm and caused a row over there. Perhaps you should talk to them. Uh, excuse me. - The sergeant's in charge of the case. - Very pleased to meet you. This gentleman's from the Ministry of Agriculture. Sergeant? Sergeant! Sergeant! No! Edna, what's happened? What's happened, Edna? Martin. He tried to kill me. I ran over him with the car. He's back there. George! I'm so... I'm so frightened. It's so awful. - Can you manage? - Petrol. How many gallons? - Quick. Help me. - Oh, the poor lassie. - Is there a phone about? - Yes, in there. Inside. Okay. Call for an ambulance, and hurry up! Hey, what are you doing? That's paraffin. I haven't time to explain. I'll be back in a few minutes. Marie, get her something to drink. Now, you just sit down there. Move! Get her something to drink. Water, not whiskey! She may not have any money. Come on, lass. We're to call the hospital. Are you all right, love? No! Grab him! Let go! Sorry to spoil your fun, old boy, but we sent Martin's body to the hospital for an autopsy. As for poor old Benson, I'd like to... Sergeant, listen to me. Put out an alarm at once. If Martin arrives at the hospital, we're right back where we started. There are three bodies in there, and he can bring them back to life! Bring the dead back to life, is it? What kind of idiots do you think we are? It's the truth. You've got to stop him! - Get him out of here before... - Can't you see? We've got to burn him! That's enough of that. All right. Go to the hospital if you don't believe me! All right then, Bernard. See if you can switch on. Right. Well done, Clive. And this! What's the meaning of this? Oh, for crying out loud. What do you think I am? I've never been to a black mass in my life. How many times do I have to tell you? I sell this kind of stuff, Sergeant. I was bringing this lot to a shopkeeper in Windermere. He was... Oh, what's the use? You expect us to believe all that after everything that's happened? Look, it's not my fault, Sergeant, if Christ and saints are out of fashion. And it's not against the law yet, so why don't you get off my back? - Where's your girlfriend hiding? - Go and find her, since you know so much. - You admitted burning the corpses. - Well, I told you why! We caught you in the act as well, and this here statement clearly confirms what we already know. Sign here, and it'll be a lot easier for you. Admit killing two officers, and it'll be all over. It was the corpses. Don't you understand? The corpses. The corpses! You sit in here wasting time, and there are people in real danger! You, you're the ones who are crazy, not me! You bloody idiot! The son of a bitch killed two of my men! Get a hold of yourself, man. Go clean him up. Come with me. Come with me, please. I disapprove of your methods, Sergeant. The police should never resort to violence. And I disapprove of yours, Mr. Perkins. If we just had a free hand with these criminals... Sergeant! Sergeant, he got away. - Kinsey! Kinsey! - I tried to stop him, but I couldn't. - Where's she gone? - Oh, you. Look at the mess she's made! You might have told me she was violent. But you'll pay for this. - Right down to the last penny! - Where is she? You told me to call an ambulance. They took her to the hospital. Hospital? All that talk about the dead coming to life. I think she must be insane. So how was the film? Come on. Tell me all about it. Hold on. Southgate Hospital. Good evening. Get me Duffield! You're all in terrible danger! - Yes. Can I help you, please? - Christ! Don't waste time! - Give me the operating room! - I can't do that. I mean... Look, let me speak to Dr. Duffield! He'll understand. Hurry up, for Christ's sake! Hold on a minute, Christine. You ought to hear the bloke on the other line. He's balmy. Yeah. No! No. Please. Room 5. Doctor, it's for you. Hello! Hello? Hello? What are you waiting for, man? I don't know, Dr. Duffield. He didn't say who he was. Very well. Sorry. What were you saying about that film? Oh, no. I can't stand him. He's really awful. Don't like her much either. No. Oh, she looks like... Please, Doctor. Can't you let me see my sister? Just two minutes. The officer's gone, and my sister would be so happy. Yes, it'll do her good. Come along now. She's up on the second floor. Martin! No! Help! Martin! Oh! Help! On! Help! Katie. Don't worry about me. I'm much better now. Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help me! - What's going on? - Nothing. Must be that lunatic in Room 5. She was screaming like that earlier when they brought her in. Convulsions. - Who's with her? - Dr. Duffield. It's all right. - Edna! - George! George! George! Get away from me! Edna. I wish the dead could come back to life, you bastard, because then I could kill you again. - Keep out of it, please. - Out of the way, please.
