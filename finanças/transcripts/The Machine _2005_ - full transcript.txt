Let's get out of here. The car is about to come... Antonio is right there. Come on, come on. A MÃ¡quina - The Machine - Back where Antonio comes from is incredibly far away. Incredibly far away in time, which is even more distant than incredibly far away in space. After all, to come from a faraway place in space is nothing to be especially proud of, as all winged creatures certainly know. But to come from a long distance in time it's what one really can call to come from afar. From a distance that can take forever to get unimpossible. But back in Antonio's time, this world had already become a mad world. And if you want to understand how mad it was, you have to start from the beginning, from billions of years ago, when this world came to be. Everything was dry as hell. There was neither land or sky, nor beast or human. There was nothing. Only pitch black darkness. And then God got a little fed up with that and decided to create the world. He thought: "How silly I am!" "Why linger in this nothingness when I can invent whatever I want?" - And off He went, inventing away. - First He invented... Time, so He would have the time to invent everything else. - And then... - The Heavens, to have a place to live in. But, as the Heavens needed something to hang upon... - God invented... - The Earth to go beneath it. And God thought: "Shouldn't there be something under the Earth as well?" Then, He... He picked up Hell and placed underneath. - I wanna speak! - At first, this was the Earth's only purpose: To be under the Heavens and over Hell. But then God said: "Well, now there's Earth, I might as well invent people to live upon it." And, with this, He created life. And death, for all living beings will eventually die. "Damn it", it occurred to Him. "If every creature has a nose, a mouth, ears and eyes, all these need to have a purpose." With the eyes one looks up to the Heavens, with the nose one breathes throughout life and stops breathing to rest in peace. But the mouth and the ears remained useless, and that's why God made the Logos. Logos was the way God referred to the words. And God starts inventing them all. - Mountain. - River. - Stream. - Elephant. - Donkey. - Grass. Avocado, sapodilla, tangerine. But because every word needed a thing to correspond to it, God had to invent a lot of things. So there would be a thing for each word. Avocado, sapodilla, tangerine, grass, elephant, donkey. - Mountain, river, stream. - And as if these weren't enough, men invented even more things. Nail, screw, corn meal, button, popsicle... From when the world was invented till Antonio's time, a lot of words were invented. A lot of things happened, a lot of time had to pass before Antonio's day in time. But Antonio's time, as it was known afterwards, Antonio's time has begun when Antonio came to this world. These silly people ask if I want my own soccer team. No way! I've never liked the figure 11. Is it "figure" you say, Valdene? Anyway, it doesn't matter. I prefer 7. The number of Wonders of the World. And 13, only to defy luck. "13 sons? All boys? That's impossible." Is it Law of Probability... Is it how you say it, Valdene? I don't know anything about laws. I want that you take this picture, Mr. Jaime, so people won't gossip. Thirteen sons right here. Valdene, Martoni, Marcondes, Marcos, Marvin, Maciel, Cristiano, Santiago, Z? Geraldo, S?vio, Saulo, St?fano and Antonio. And you, mister, be still! I want this picture taken and I want it now. I'm talking to you both. You that have just arrived, and the other that is going away. I don't want to ruin my only portrait with the whole family together because a boy is eager to hit the road and the other is screaming... his heart out. Shut up, Antonio! Do you wanna cry? Do you? Ok, you can cry. Scream louder. Come on... But if you don't stop screaming we won't take this picture. Please forgive me, Mr. Jaime, but I won't do it this way. Go play outside! Off you go! All of you. There won't be any picture. - And what about me, mommy? - You're gonna wait till this... - picture is taken. - But you've said... - there wouldn't be any. - Not until this brat shuts up. I won't have a sad or noisy portrait. You calm yourself down and wait... till your brother quiets down. Then we'll take the picture, I'll give you my blessing, God will bless you, after this you can go. Do you want me to miss the van tomorrow? Do you want me to wait another whole week for the next van? And spend another 7 days in this God-forsaken village of Nordestina? Dear Lord of Time, the boy won't stop screaming. Father, You that order all that happens through out time You that establish all the beginnings and the ends and guide us all towards Madam Eternity, I offer you this boy, Antonio, that today is 5 years old, five years of tears. Irok, my Father, sacred Kala, Lord of the Hours, my saint, take my Antonio and dry his tears, take him through the paths of joy, always. For what comes with time. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, in the name of Our Lady, ax?, amen. C'mon, everyone! Antonio stopped crying! And as Time had made tears fall from the sky instead of Antonio's eyes, it seemed to have taken the boy under its wing. Antonio had heard this story since he was little, and was certain that he was truly a son of Time. Antonio, do you see the spot from where we can't see anymore? The very spot that divides it all? Don't you see a line there? It is known as the line of horizon, but I prefer to call it "the cross". And when I cross this so-called line I'll want to check if there's really a line on the ground between Nordestina and the next town. But what I wanna see the most is how things are beyond that line, in this "world"... people talk so much about. What about you? Tomorrow, after I leave, you'll be the next in line. But you'll never truly leave, I know that. You will be forever "the next in line". And in the end you will be "the one who never left". I don't get what you find so special about this place. There was a girl in Nordestina living right over there, in a house down the street. This girl had a way of narrowing her eyes as she looked at things, and Antonio was madly in love with her. Who knows? This may be the beginning of a story that has just begun FOR SALE Who knows? I might be the leading lady of this story CITY HALL FRANCHISE AVAILABLE Who knows? This might be the reason why Every thought I have turns into a song LEARN TO SPEAK RIO DE JANEIRO'S SLANG A theme song for the leading lady A starting song Who knows? - Karina! Hey, J?ssica. Prazeres is waiting for you. Everyone has tried on their costumes - and chosen their masks. - Every-one, J?ssica? Are you and the girls everyone? The same old faces everytime... Last year it only made me mad. But this year they say we'll even have strangers. Who will want to come to a masquerade in Nordestina? The strange places these people come from must be even worse than here. But Prazeres says your costume is almost ready and there's no way she'll take it back. And who told her to make me a costume - before I ordered it? - She didn't tell me that. COSTUMES FOR THE MASQUERADE What's with all the people in front of the church? - Today is van's day. - So today is Monday. And if today is Monday, tomorrow will be Tuesday. Mrs. Ernestina left on a Tuesday, didn't she? It was probably on a Monday, on van's day. Mrs. Ernestina always said flask instead of glass. There they go, another herd of fools. These people are just dumb, that's what they are. They think they'll get away from here and go places, be somebody, but they just end up like everybody else. A couple more lost souls in the world. Just like your mother, such a pathetic woman. They'll forget about their families, their friends, even their children. Do you know what we call it? Ingratitude, that's what it is. How can this town move forward, if everyone just leaves it behind? People leave because there's no money here. And why won't they send some money here? If everyone is leaving anyway? - So they might stay. - But there ain't no money here! Karina, Karina! Beware of this kind of thinking, little lady! Hey... How much was it? - Take it as a gift. - This way I won't take it. R$19,99. - I don't have change. - Take it as a gift. The only gift I want is the honor of bringing these ocean-blue eyes to the world. Have you decided yet? When I decide to go, I'll buy the ticket and leave. And I won't need to tell you in advance. You have quite a wait until you come of age and do it. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I'm only 147 days away from my eighteenth birthday. - You'll hardly notice it. - It'll seem like forever, - but the time will pass eventually. - I know why you are in such a hurry. - You want to be an actress. - Who told you that? I've heard you've been preparing to audition for a TV soap opera. But I can take you as soon as you want. And I promise your father won't know about it. Before Mr. Neco realizes it, you'll be long gone. Are you gonna do some magic and make me invisible? Let me worry about that. But if I'm going to take the risk, - I want you to be mine. - No way! Please, Karina. I have a plan to bring you to the world. I have it all figured out up here. - Who are you? - I am anything you want me to be. Whatever you wish, you just need to wish for it and I'll make it come true. So you are the one I wished for night and day? If you don't believe me, you can ask me to prove it. - Anything? - Anything at all. So I want you to take away the darkness of night. If the night isn't but the day when it gets dark, how can I take away the darkness leaving the night behind? Had I knew how to make it I'd go there make it myself. So I'll have to invent a new star each night till they are so close together that no one can see darkness amongst them. Antonio... Did you kiss me for real, Antonio? Haven't I told you a thousand times? It is supposed to be a make-believe kiss. Don't you get it? Of course I get it. A character who is not myself will use my mouth to kiss a character who uses your mouth, but is not you. And I have to feel the character inside, feel the love he feels, desire as he desires... but when the time comes I'll have to leave him aside and be myself again only to remember it is a make-believe and he is the one who is kissing, and not me. I understand it, alright. But I don't think that's fair, because the character gets all the benefit. - The benefit? - What? The benefit? - So you only want to benefit from me? - No! - Is that why you agreed to rehearse? - No! - So you could benefit from me? - No! - Don't you have any decency? - No! I mean, yes. I do! I mean... what? You are as dumb as the others. I don't think you'll ever leave this place. I've never wanted to leave. Why would I want to leave, - if I never wanted to leave? - Because this place is nowhere. You can't find Nordestina on any map, there is no Diet Pepsi Twist - or any beach. - Beach... bah. I don't know what everyone sees in that sea. You can't say without seeing it. - And I'll never see it. - But I will. And it won't take much longer, and I am not just going for a visit. I'll live in the world as if I was from there. - You can bet on that! - No, you won't, Karina. You have this place in you. You would like to go, that's for sure. But do you know what this place would do? It would go there with you. You could walk, you could run or even fly, you could say: "Go away, Nordestina, and let me be", but Nordestina would always follow you: "Karina! Karina, Karina!" You've barely learned how to act and now you want to create the special effects. In his eyes, Antonio saw Karina as a movie. With reruns and all. You've barely learned how to act and now you want to create the special effects. He was a son of Time, alright, but sometimes Antonio overdid it. You've barely learned how to act and now you want to create the special effects. For Karina, Antonio was the guy who went over her house after work. Am I early for our training? It's not a training, it's a rehearsal. But before "after work" there was a whole lot of... before. I'm here to pick up my fan. It is good as knew. Then you can keep it as payment for your work. I'll leave in the next van, so I won't need it anymore. Other people have already had the same idea. What need do I have for another fan? And has someone brought you a machine like this to fix? - Not like this, no, sir. - So you can fix it for me, and I'll leave it to you as payment. Antonio's work was almost always a lot of work, and he almost never got any good money for it. One hour's work could last for ages... But not forever, thanks be to Our Lady. Each day at the same time, Lady Luck smiled on Antonio. And as he wasn't anyone of importance, he was never late. Am I early for our training? It's not a training, it's a rehearsal. Haven't you noticed that I came to pick you up in my car? In those times, all ladies wanted do be pretty, and each pretty lady wanted to be on TV. TV was a thing that showed some stories to entertain the people. From time to time they'd interrupt the stories and show some ads for products such as... hair lotion. Their purpose was to find someone who would buy the products in the ads, Then a part of the profits was used to pay for the ads, and another part was used to produce the stories. But the stories they produced were so great that one would have thought they were the sole purpose of it all. If the story was a song, they called it... a music video. A video is a kind of short movie you watch, but don't need to understand. The Sconhecidos were five guys who were in a hit video that September. If you come with me For whatever It may I promise you the sun If the sun comes out today Or the rain If it rains If you come as far as we can go To a square by the sea In a place somewhere On this white day If it's a white day So much In this song of love If you want to come with me For whatever It may If you come with me For whatever It may I promise you the sun If the sun comes out today Or the rain If it rains If you come as far as we can go to a square by the sea In a place somewhere On this white day If it's a white day And this song This love, so big, big love If you want to come with me For whatever it may If it's a white day This song, this song This love, so big, big love If you want to come with me For whatever It may - Antonio! You scared me! - What does he want from you? - It's none of your business. - Really? And who do you are to ask me this? Antonio really wasn't anyone in Karina's life. MASQUERADE TOMORROW'S NIGHT He wasn't even a friend, or a confidant. Although he didn't want to be any of those things. If he wouldn't be Karina's love, he'd rather be nothing to her. That night stretched on as long as it could. But then the morning got fed up and decided to present itself. So Antonio had no option but to start the day, although he didn't know what to do with it amidst all the pain he felt. Am I early for our training? We won't have any training today. No training and no rehearsal. But why? Because. Because of what? Because I have too much to do than to stay here and look at your dumb face. - And after this? - After what? After you do what you have to do instead of looking at my dumb face? If I were you, I wouldn't wait. So I won't wait. Do you know why? Because this love character pretends to feel, that is patient enough to wait until after the commercial break and only after it, to finish what it'd pretended to start can only be fictitious love. Very different from this thing I feel, this crazy thing I can't find a name for. There is no word or sound or written letter that can explain the exaggeration of it! - Where have you read it from? - I haven't read it, nor memorized it, and I wouldn't be able to say it again. The feelings you really feel don't need to be registered. No one has anything to do with it, only the person who feels them and the one responsible for the affection. This subject only matters to you and I. At least this one time you could pretend you are yourself so you know what to feel, for this kiss I'll give you now will be from my real self. I wonder what one should say at a moment like this. - Lf I knew, I'd say it. - It might be some word of love. - Then say it. - Do I really need to? Haven't you always known, that I was crazy about you? - Then say it! - I've just said it. Now it is your turn. Say it. A word of love! Or any other word, so I'll know what's in your mind. Happiness. Really? Really, truly. So we just need to set the date. The date? For our marriage. I wanna marry you, Karina. At the nearest town where we can find a priest. I will speak with your father today. Then I'll find a fine job. Something important, maybe in the Notary Public Office. We'll have a savings account, and even a check book. Antonio, can you turn away while I get dressed? You will have everything a woman can wish for: Bracelets, dresses, a cell phone, a karaoke system... A lot of kids and a big, big house where we will set a lot of tables and chairs for the birthday parties we'll throw for them. Can I turn now, Karina? Can I? I will look now. Don't you sweat The future can bring anything Including nothing at all Don't you sweat The caterpillar shall crawl Till the day it grows its wings Don't you sweat Mrs. Happiness is never never late Don't you sweat Tomorrow maybe she'll be right at your door Don't you sweat For to start walking you must take the first step Nature is never in a hurry it has its timing And relentlessly things get where they should be Don't you sweat Look at that lady going up the hill No matter if she is a princess or a laundress To get at the top she will need to strain - Shame on you, boy! - Please, forgive me. How nice it is to make love How nice it is to make love Please, tell me what Karina's mask looks like so I can find her. A mask is a very private thing. As secret as the things you confess to a priest. I just want to look at the pattern she picked. You can't, because the other lad took it away. - Wasn't it a secret? - This case was different. Karina gave me permission to give him the patterns. I wouldn't dare to do it otherwise. - Who was this lad? - I've promised not to tell. But I haven't promised not to look at him... - So I'll buy two masks. - What for? You'll see. Before we leave I have to tell you something. If you wanna take the risk and bring me to the world, Z? On?rio, I'll thank you for it, but you will never have me, because I now belong to another man. Do you understand? Hey, hey! Damn... Who do you think you are, Antonio? - I'm Antonio. - Well, but you shouldn't be. - I was talking to Jos? On?rio. - No, you weren't. Do you think you have what it takes to bring me to the world? Don't you see you are too insignificant to embrace such a cause? It wasn't in my plans to bring you to the world. Why would I care to embrace this cause if I was born to live here? Why, if now you've begun to like wanting me and soon you will like to live here with me? Yes, I've begun to like wanting you. I've never thought I'd like love this much. But to live here, this I'll never want, Antonio. What about life out there? When you talk like this it feels like you have disregard for me. Disregard is when someone's importance flees from our thoughts by itself, Antonio. I am shooing your presence from my mind, so I will have space left for other things. And then she started to curse the world, saying the most difficult words. He would've never imagined she knew the Portuguese language that well. Of course I'd never wish to leave if I had control over my wishes. If only I could rewrite the map of the world all over again, and if I could reinvent Geography, and Economy, Sociology and Philosophy... Karina spoke beautifully that day! But unless I want to remain this imitation of a person living imitated days in this imitation of a life I need to leave this place, for the truth is that it's only in the world out there that things happen for real. Is it the world you want? So I'll bring you the world. The world isn't a thing you can bring or take away. There are those who wish for the world and those who don't. If you wish for it, I'll bring it to to you, for this isn't a girl's job. Antonio! What are you gonna do? I'll think of something on the way. Before the next chapter, Antonio found the time to lead one more scene. Don't you believe me, Nordestina? Nordestina probably hadn't believed a word, but it didn't say anything. For towns, as small as they can be, aren't made to answer anyone nor doubt their people. Towns are made to be the place where their inhabitants inhabit. Damn be the town which can't fulfill its sole purpose. When he arrived at the world, Antonio went straight to the mall in order to improve his looks. The mall was a building that housed goods instead of people. They must have practiced a lot to switch on right when the last one switches off! The little lamps... They must have practiced a lot. A security guard is a guy who gets paid to make other people insecure. Where are you from, Para?ba? Para?ba is not a name for people, it is the name of a State. Wait! And which place do you come from? I am from Nordestina, which is not in Para?ba. I am Antonio, son of Nazar?. Well, I am Valdene, son of Nazar?. The day I decided to order the sea The angel started laughing and said I'd have to wait For there's a lot of people that wants Copacabana Maybe it will take them a week to deliver it But as soon as he can he'll bring you The blue sea you've been dreaming about In this truck that comes down from infinitude To supply our love story In this truck that comes down from infinitude To supply our love story Well, it is not that impressive at all. In fact... it's even smaller than I thought. But it is cold, alright. It's all South Pole, from here on down. The Geography of the world could make a fine science. We could comment on everything there is in this world. Had we the right adverbs to place at the end of each sentence and we'd be talking forever. But I have other things to do. - Important things? - Well... I've come to take the world. And bring it to my girl. As a gift. Don't you think the world as it is now, this messed up world, is a crappy gift? True, it does need a fixing. It is one thing to change the place where the world is. But to change how it is, that's another story. - That'd be way more complex. - You're right. - But it's a lot more fun. - Right again! Valdene? Do you know who drilled this shortcut? No, I don't. I found it like this when I arrived. - And will it take us to television? - Everything in this world... - take us to television. - So that's where we are going to. He is from the small Nordestina, - in Para?ba State... - Not Para?ba. Pernambuco. Pernambuco. And he says he can travel through time. Our guest today is the young Antonio. - Are you ok, Antonio? - Affirmative. - Are you nervous? - Affirmative. Do you see this yellow bar? Affirmative. Each time a TV set is tuned on our show, the bar grows taller. Do you understand? - Affirmative. - He is so cute... But for that bar to grow taller, you'll have to seat a little! And not only literally, for people see sweaty bodies on TV everyday. So... - Do you know how to dance? - Negative. Our dear viewers want to see something new. Have you prepared anything different to show us today? You can bet on it. This is a live show. You'll have one minute to get the viewers' attention. If you can't make the bar grow taller, you are gonna be... Outta here People are watching. Go get 'em! I am Antonio, son of Nazar?. Take my word, I'll travel to the future to check on the expiration date of this world I want to bring as a gift to Karina. And you intend to leave now? Negative. My departure will be eight days from now. I'll leave Nordestina's square for future times, and I'll vanish completely right before the eyes of the people there. It seems that our viewers aren't taking you seriously. Imagine if everyone turns their TV on at the time you've set but something goes wrong. What will you say to our viewers? Time is running out! - Lf you can't take my word on it... - Time is up! Our next guest is a Chinese dwarf, - and a kung-fu master... - You got it wrong! - Look at the clock. - It's broken. No, it's not. Time is waiting for me to finish. And if they can't take my word, I'll offer my life to our dear viewers. In case I don't honor my word and don't vanish, - what's going to happen? - What's going to happen? In that case life won't mean anything to me, and I'll die. - He will die! - At the very moment I should vanish. At the very moment! The boy is good. And it won't be like any death. - No, it won't. - I'll die an impressive death... - Listen to him! - A real extraordinary death that will impress the men and make the women want to cover their eyes in fear, while still sneaking a peek. He'll impress the men and scare the women! When the countdown starts they'll launch towards me a machine with 700 spinning blades, blades as sharp as can be. If I can't manage to vanish, it will tear my breast open... and tear it more and more till people can see all there is inside: All the feelings feeling, all the arteries splitting apart, all the blood flowing. The blades will open my stomach and pull all my insides out, one by one. They'll split my lungs apart, so people can see what lies in-between them, and they'll tear my heart out and throw it to the audience, splashing blood all over them. And only then... I'll begin to die. I'm gonna suffer and suffer, till I die the most beautiful death. I'm gonna die for love, there in the hinterlands, embraced by the drought, with the heat boiling all my ideas up... As long as I have any ideas left. My life giving up living, fading away, things blurring before my eyes, my reason evaporating, until the very end, until that moment a person thinks to himself: "Damn... And now what?" Then stops thinking. And it's over. Now I'd like a Diet Pepsi Twist, please. Make it two. One for myself and one for Valdene. WELCOME TO NORDESTINA You were right. I couldn't find Nordestina on the world's maps. Not yet. But that's about to change, you'll see. On any globe people will read: N, o, r, d, e, s, t, i, n, a. Forget about the world, Antonio! This is crazy! Please, don't do it! Don't worry, girl. I'll be back from the future in no time. I am not as ignorant as you think I am. I know very well the future can't be as near as the next village! I'll only travel 50 years forward, Karina. Only half a century. Not one day more, I promise. I'll need only to multiply my age by 3.5, then unmultiply it, and that's it. End of story. They'll broadcast Antonio's death live! - He's gonna go to the future. - Didn't he say he would die? If he can transport himself to the future he won't die. He'll vanish before the machine hits him. I don't know what he'll do exactly, but the fact is they'll broadcast it live. Now they want to come back. Look at them, heard of fools. And with all these suckers coming back, And they all came here to see the crazy stunts from the craziest man this town has ever produced. You're the crazy one, with all your rambling! They'd never seen such an epidemic! One by one, two by two, ten by ten they'd come. Every house in Nordestina was turned into a hotel, each backyard into a camping site. And all those people had to eat. All the goats and chickens were roasted. And after there weren't any left, all the edible creatures they could find were cooked or stewed. You won't give up, will you? You really intend to make this damn trip. Antonio! What did you say? Forget it. The whole world is watching you. Say something. You've never even asked me to stay. Or told me to come back home. I've never shed a tear in all these years. And I always knew for sure you'd come back to me someday. I'm only here because of my daughter. I knew she'd need her mother around. If this is the only reason you're here, you can go back to your precious world! You can leave me here in peace. Me and God. Me, my heart, and all this nothingness. The Sconhecidos are here! The Sconhecidos? Here in Nordestina? I don't buy that. Sleep my little one There's no use to wake up now I'm gonna leave I'm gonna run After the most serene of daybreaks Sleep now my little one There's no use to wake up now Don't you fear death? The only fear I've heard of is the fear death has of me. From the day I heard the knocks on my door: "Who is it?" "That's me!" "Are you Mrs. Death?" "Why wouldn't I be?" "So come on in. We need to talk." She sat down. And I sat down right before her. And for starters I told her a little poem I made using the little learning that I have and the great love I have for Karina. Only a few verses. Three days of reciting. But I was so involved with my reciting that I started improvising afterwards, and only a month and a half later she yawned for the first time. But it took me another two years to make her doze off. And we talked and we talked, and after 15 years I felt like singing. Only a little song. Take, take, take your hands Take, take, take your hands off me Take, take, take your hands And I sang and sang, defying Mrs. Death, while she kept silent. Till she finally got fed up with all that, and said: "If you'll excuse me, I have some business to take care of... I'll be back later." Do you think she came back? No way! And from that day on, I sing everyday, In case she passes by. For Mrs. Death hates singing, as well as any sign of joy, poetry, laughter, beauty, kids' talking and of course the color yellow... Antonio talked and talked about his trip in time, while everyone thought he would end up on a trip to the afterworld! Antonio was always the weirdest of boys. Now that all his brothers are back with their families, he decided to take this trip through time! You can go, if that's what you want. But I've told you not to interfere in how things happen. You shouldn't disturb Time. Mrs. Nazar? said she wouldn't go to the event. If she had decided to put off her work simply to watch each of Antonio's stunts, she'd never finish any task. Once she made up her mind, Mrs. Nazar? stayed home, all alone. He came to my show and asked me for an opportunity. I only did what I had to do. And today the whole world is watching him. This is Antonio we are talking about, and we broadcast live from Nordestina. This is a special edition of our show, and we are gonna show you everything as it happens. Antonio will face a terrible machine, with its 700 killer blades. And the machine will be operated by Valdene, Antonio's own brother. Might this be a family tragedy waiting to occur? We'll show every moment of it. Let us pray for Antonio. It's a damn old contraption! Will he make it? His brother is in the car. The policemen are doing their job. We gonna try to speak to the man. And the blades are rotating. I wouldn't dare to touch them. Let's try to talk with Valdene. Valdene? Is it possible you'll end up killing your brother? He is concentrating. Look at his face. Let's get out of here. The car is about to come out. And Antonio is right there... Look who is here. She is the reason for all this. And, all of a sudden, now wasn't now anymore. Or at least it wasn't the now Antonio used to know. But if that was another point in time, right before his eyes, what point in time would it be, after all? It was 50 years after the day Antonio had left for the future. Right in the middle of Nordestina's square. - Can I ask you a question? - Only if it is a short one. Antonio's luggage has traveled from the past with him? His luggage and his shirt, pants, underwear, socks and shoes. Everything that was on Antonio or attached to him traveled through time as well. And suppose Antonio was in a stable holding a donkey's tail. Would the stable and the donkey have left with him? They probably would. But they would've been useless, for Antonio wasn't here for long. Cause right then, everything started to run backwards. Let's get out of here. The car is about to come out. Antonio is right there... Oh, Lord... Antonio had already gone through that. Look who is here. She is the reason for all this. And when he saw the 700 rotating blades ready to slice up his body, the 700 blades he had prepared one by one, Antonio ran away. Look at him run! It is a mess down here... Let's see what happened. Antonio is hanging from the structure. Let's see how Valdene is doing. And when his two feet touched the ground, and when people saw he was all there, from his head to toes, they started booing. How unfortunate Antonio was! For the moment he left was right before the moment he came back, without the tiniest gap between the two. So nobody believed Antonio had really left. Let the man talk! Antonio, can you explain what happened here? All they want to know is: Why haven't you traveled to the future? I went to the future, alright, but I got confused on my way back and arrived here right at the moment I'd left. It was unfortunate! Give us some evidence, Antonio. Antonio knew that his entire future, from then on, would depend on what he decided to answer. Time will keep passing, and you will all see that I will arrive there. Fifty years from today, right here in the square at Nordestina, around midnight. We want unquestionable evidence. Unfortunately we don't have this much time. The whole world despised each word out of Antonio's mouth. How sad! The whole world started laughing at Antonio. The whole world except for Karina, of course. We'd like to apologize to our dear viewers, for this was the most ridiculous display of unprofessional behaviour. Time will pass, alright, and these people will see that you are gonna be there, 50 years from today, right here in the middle of the square in Nordestina, around midnight. Karina, I don't want you near him! Now let us get away from here before the world decides to tear us apart. Then a windstorm started, only to spray dust on everybody and make that moonlit night darker. - It's dangerous, Karina! - Run! And all of a sudden rain started pouring down, not for long either. I wouldn't have the words to explain About us She and I Why me with her? I didn't know any poems Nor many beautiful words But she decided to take me by her hand We'd walk in our dizzyness Aimlessly We'd laugh and we'd cry without any reason Today when I recall her face When I see myself through her eyes I know that it all happened as it should Only because there was her and I And all this Time, I've had only one feeling in my heart and one question in my mind. In your heart you've missed Karina. And what about in your mind? What should I have said to those people in order to convince them I'd really been to the future. And have you found any convincing answer? More than that. I've found evidence! And what would that be, you crazy man? I'll tell it only to Antonio when he arrives from the past. And when will that be? 50 years after the day he left for the future. Can't you be more precise? Precisely today, right around midnight. Damn... So you'd better hurry before you miss this date with yourself, Antonio. Nordestina isn't very far from here, but it isn't that close either. The hard part will be getting out of this sanatorium, so full of doors, doorknobs, and door locks, each one with their proper key. As if it was the real problem in the world! Problem?! What? Where is it? - The bag. - Bag? - Bag... - The keys, man! I don't wanna hear a peep about it! I don't wanna hear. If nowadays' Antonio manages to meet Antonio from the past it'll be the craziest thing, it'll change the world's History, cause everything could have been different. And we'd have a chance to live different lives. But if Antonio from the past goes back to his past as ignorant as he arrives here, things will happen exactly as they happened until this very moment, and we will be in the same situation. But I demand a lawyer! A lawyer! Wouldn't you like to have lived another life? Won't you hand us what you have in your bag? Love is an old old man And is also a little girl Love is a path Made of sheets and guilt fear and wonder Love is an old old man And is also a little girl Love is a path Made of sheets and guilt fear and wonder Do you really think that if this Antonio meets the other one, everything could be different, including our own lives? Well, I don't really believe it. But I can always be wrong. Time, life and labor walk across the ground Love is airborne Love walks amongst tangos Love mocks the passing of time It walks with the gypsies And through ocean floors Love is a pit where people pour their waste and gems Prayers, sacrifices and betrayals WELCOME TO NORDESTINA Antonio? Antonio! I don't know how I should call you. Should I use "sir," "you," "thou," "me" or "us"? As far as I'm concerned you can call me "nobody", for this is what I am going to be once you go back in Time and live everything differently until you get here as another Antonio, much better than this one here. And what about Karina? I haven't seen her for exactly 50 years today. Christ... If it is true I'll live my entire life without her then I prefer not to live that long. Well, I have lived my entire life without her, but you won't make the same mistake. What is it that went wrong once you got back? How can I change things? First of all, you manage to stay alive and don't you hesitate to run away from danger. Then you'll have to deal with the people, as they'll demand some evidence that you really were here in the future. But all you'll have to do is to open this suitcase up. And now, off you go... I miss Karina so much I can barely stand it. All there was inside the suitcase was a piece of paper with something written on it. Give us some evidence, Antonio. In the future I've met a guy who told me some things that will happen, and he has sent a message for all those who care to listen. First of all I'd like to warn all the women here: Hold on to your skirts, for here comes the wind! But the windstorm won't last long! Once everyone is fully covered in dust the rain will pour down on us! As each thing Antonio was saying really happened, there could be no better evidence. So everybody believed he'd traveled to the future. In the future fear will turn into myth, lack will turn into abundance, word will turn into fact and joy will be the law! Z? On?rio, I've seen you there in the future! You owned your own transport company, and you were married to J?ssica. And people liked the stories Antonio told them so much that they all started to imitate his ideas. Mr. Neco and Mrs. Maria da Gra?a, you two were back together, and lived happily ever after. Ever after. Very happy, you were. After the way he begged, insisted and cried for your love you wouldn't be able to throw away such a beautiful feeling. Each one of them had decided to be happy, no matter what. Prazeres, I've seen you there! Always the life of the party! And will I live till I'm over 100 years old? You are already over a 100 years old now. In the future you'll be 200! And everyone in Nordestina became very important people. That guy over there was a political leader... Then it was Karina's turn. And you really like to make wishes. I've seen us both in the future: You made your wishes and I invented things, I invented things and you made your wishes. And life got better, fortunately. Everything in the world began to be more and more like the stories Antonio told. Time was back at its good old rhythm: Each hour took an hour, each day took a day, each year took exactly a year. And as Time passed, year after year, that 50 years eventually passed. The day Antonio promised to appear in future has finally come, and it is today. But I can't say anything further. Because I need to be at Karina's side, comforting her. For it's almost midnight, and where is Antonio? Easy, Karina. It is only fair that he gets here a little late. For back where Antonio comes from is incredibly far away.
