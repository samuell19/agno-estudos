(ominous instrumental music) - This house was vacant. It had trees and weeds that just covered the house, and you couldn't, you could barely see it. And I just saw it and went in my head, that's a beautiful, beautiful home. Why did they let it go like that? So, I had a friend who was a realtor look into who owned it, if it was for sale. And a couple weeks after that, she got back to me and said, "It's vacant. "The bank owns it. "It's gonna go up for auction. "I'll let you know." And we put the offer in that day. - [Steve] From what I understand, the condition of the home was pretty rough. You guys. - [Stephanie] It was. It was very bad. Yeah, when we bought the house, gosh, we had to replace probably 90% of the windows. We had to put a new roof on. There was three feet of water in the basement when we bought it. - [Steve] Wow. - There was no plumbing. There were no light fixtures. A couple bath tubs missing. They were the cast iron. - Yeah, clawfoot. - Clawfoot tubs. They were missing. It was just discarded, kind of, it was kind of sad. - It was my wife's idea, Stephanie, to acquire the house. I was more inclined, at the time with where the economy was and opportunities in the township to acquire beautiful homes for basically half price because of what was happening in the real estate market. But I was overruled 'cause she had this ambition of taking on a project of this type and spearheading a renovation. And with the help of some family members and such, turning it into a home that she thought we'd enjoy. So, we decided to buy the property, and the rest is history. - [Steve] So, you guys get into the house, and you start to rehab and start to gut it and all that stuff. When did you realize, for the first time, that something wasn't quite right? - We heard somebody walking around upstairs and walking down the stairs, and it wasn't just me. - I was about 13 or 14 when we finally moved in 'cause it took a long time to redo this house. And I did hear a lot of things like, and I saw things in the corner of my eye. And I would see shadows. Like, they were always like by the windows and stuff, and that happened a lot. Like, you always felt like there's something or someone with you. - I can feel people like watching me sometimes, just randomly when I'm doing something, anything. Sometimes I hear keys playin' on the piano like in the higher section and when I'm just in my room doing something. And I can sometimes hear footsteps around the house. - I've experienced that myself, where I'd be sitting in the family room, which is the room below my office here, and the dog, Hector, would start barking at a wall. There have been instances where the cats would park themselves in front of the stairwell leading up to my office and just stare up the stairwell and maybe start to hiss a little bit. So, those are the types of things I've experienced. - It was weird from the start, you know. It always just felt weird in here. Even though my brother and I had different rooms, we'd share, end up sharin' a bed every night 'cause it, we'd get freaked out. I did get banging on this door all the time. I go out this door over here. Around like 75% of the time, every night I'd, you know, most of the nights I'd hear just (door rattling) goin' like this, and I kinda got used to it 'cause, you know, it didn't really. Nothing really bad was like happening. But it still like freaked me out every night, and I'd wake up to it, and it'd freak me out. - Now, when you say 75% of the time, I mean, you're saying almost every night that you slept in here something would rattle that door. - Yeah, all the time. I moved out to my own house when I was 17 because I didn't like living here. - So, it literally drove you out of the house. - Yeah. - 2 a.m., I'd be the only person up coming downstairs goin' to the kitchen to make some food, and I'd start hearing the piano start to play. And it wasn't like they were playing actual songs or anything. It was just note after note, not in any specific order. And I don't know how that exactly was happening, but I could clearly see none of the keys were moving. - The first thing we really noticed that was significant when we moved in was when my daughter, who was three, four at the time, got hysterical because there was some little boy in my room that was looking out the window, and he didn't have any feet, is what she said. - [Steve] Do you recall the first paranormal experience that you had in this house? - Um, the first paranormal experience was when my sister was babysitting me, and I was upstairs in my parents' room. And I walked in there, and I saw a little boy. He was looking out the window, and then he turned towards me. And then, he just disappeared. - And he definitely looked at you? He was making it clear that he could see you? - [Sabina] Yes. - [Steve] How did you respond to that? - Um, I screamed and just started running. - I would've too. (Sabina laughing) Why do you think the activity seems to really center around your daughter? That whatever's in this house gravitates to her, and I guess children in general? - I believe there's a child here. They both have seen a child. I think it's attracted to, they're children, they're fun. And they're innocent, and they can see him. - That's when we decided, we probably, it probably wasn't a very good idea, but we actually printed off the ouiji board just on a piece of paper. And we used, I had a ring that I used to wear, and we just put a string on it. And then, we asked a couple of questions. We're like, "Is there anybody there?" And, "Can you talk to us?" And they said, we got a "yes." We got, "yes," after a couple minutes. And then, I asked them to spell their name. Asked, "What, who, what's your name?" And it spelled out V-I-C. My mom looked it up. And she actually found out that a little boy named Victor died in this house at six years old. And so, then everything sort of, kind of makes sense. - Um, so, you know the Charlie, Charlie thing where, like, you ask Charlie questions, and it'd say yes or no? - You know, actually, your brother was tellin' me about that. I've never heard of that. So, tell me what that is. - Um, okay, so you get a piece of paper, and then you draw, like, basically like an X on it. And on the X you write two no's, and you write two yes's. Then, you stack two pencils on top of each other, like laying down so it makes an X. And then, you would ask yes or no questions to Charlie, and it'd either respond with yes or no by moving the pencils back and forth. - And this actually worked? - Well, we said, "Victor, Victor, are you here?" and then, we would ask it a question, and, yeah, it actually worked. - It was literally moving whenever we asked it a question. And then, we asked if there was more than one ghost in here, and it moved to yes. And then, it said, my mom asked it, "Are you here to hurt us?" And it kinda like went to no for a second, and then, boom, and it was on yes. My mom told me to go outside and burn it. - There's something here that's not mean-spirited, and I feel like there's something here that is. One night, almost two o'clock in the morning, our alarm system goes off, and my eldest son, you know, has a friend over. We have a refrigerator that has snacks in it in the garage, and I'm going, I'm assuming that, okay, he's going to the garage to get snacks. And he didn't think to turn the alarm off before he went out there. (suspenseful music) - I got out here to see what's goin' on. I grab a crutch. Me and my friend Ricky each grab a crutch 'cause we don't know what's goin' on. The alarm system's goin' off. My mom meets me right here at the door. She's like, "What are you guys doin'? "Why do you guys have crutches in your hand?" And we're like, "Well, we heard crying a little bit ago, "and now there's a big bang. "The alarm system's goin' off." - So, you guys grabbed the crutches as like weapons? - Yes, 'cause we didn't know if somebody had broken into the house or anything. So, we come out here, and I'm like, "Where's Sabina at?" - He's confused. His friend comes out behind him. They're confused, and then all of a sudden he looks at me, and he said, "Where's Sabina?" And, you know, the alarm's going off, and it's loud. She should be awake, and she should be there with us. And so I go, and I run across to her room. And I pull the bed curtains back, and she is not there. It's like I'm living in a horror movie now. - And she screams. She lets out this blood-curdling scream. So, I'm, I'm thinkin' the worst. I'm thinkin' Sabina's like dead in there, or like she's kidnapped or somethin'. So, I go into the room. I'm lookin' for Sabina. We go up into the room. And, you know, we're lookin' for Sabina, and I look out this window that's right here. - And then, I hear her scream like blood-curdling scream, and she's outside. I don't know how I got from her room to the door. Actually, I broke the screen tryin' to open it. It's mid-July, and she is maybe 10 feet from the road. - So, she got outside without even being traced by the alarm. And when my mom came in here and screamed, it still gives me goose bumps, like thinkin' about her scream. I never heard my mom scream like that. I ran outside as fast as I could. I was doin' laps around the house with a crutch tryin' to see if there was somebody here. And, you know, we didn't, Sabina wasn't really like. She didn't really know what was goin' on. - I scream out her name, and like that she like turns around and then is just bawling. And comes up onto the deck, and I pick her up. And she is like ice. I mean, her skin, she is so cold. And this is mid-July. I mean, we don't have air conditioning in this place. And for her to feel like ice scared me. I mean, I was, not only she's outside two in the morning, she's nine years old. What the heck is she doin' out there? And had my son not even said, "Where is she?" how long would I have noticed? 10, 20, 30 seconds before I would have checked. She would've been in the road. - [Sabina] That's weird that like I knew perfectly what to do, how to go do everything, unlock doors. I, like, felt somebody was like there with me guiding me through the whole thing. I was like being possessed kind of. - What do you do? I mean, we're sleeping in the middle of the night, and she's not safe. You think you're safe. We have an alarm to keep you safe. And you're not safe from what's in the house, and that's terrifying. (intense ominous music) I've only caught video of anything in this house just the once. I was upstairs making the bed, doin' the normal routines that I always do, and I heard some really strange noises. I couldn't figure out what the heck it was, and so I decided to just start recording what I was hearing and what I was picking up. The first one, this was probably five, six minutes after I started hearing something. I decided to start recording. (banging sound) - [Steve] You can see the chandelier flickering right there with that sound too. (banging sound) - And you can hear there's some really loud banging sound, and like a door's opening. (door creaking) - [Steve] Wow. - That's the door that opened. (banging sound) And the banging is actually on that door that you're hearing now. (banging sound) And you can kinda tell when it's in the hall, and then when it's on the door. This went on for at least two hours. (knocking sound) (door slamming) And then, the door finally closes. - [Steve] Wow. That just completely shuts on its own. - Yeah, and then the light goes on in this room, and it kinda looks like someone's walking in front of the door. So, that was, at some point I'm going, is there actually somebody in my house that I'm not aware of? - [Steve] Right there, you can totally see that something blocks out the light. And now, you can see the light again. - [Stephanie] Right. - [Steve] I mean, yeah, you can totally see that. I mean, something is moving under the door. It's interfering with the light. (banging sound) - Then, it started banging on that door. So, it went from the door that opened and closed to the bathroom. - [Steve] That's incredible. (banging sound) (banging sound) - So, I can't explain that one. And this was the last one. After I came out, I decided to turn on the light to see if I could see anything. And I just figured I'd continue recording. (banging sound) And this one is where I finally decided I had enough because you can hear somebody walking across the floor. (floorboards creaking) (door creaking open) (knocking sound) And so, after that I decided I had enough, and I needed to go somewhere else for the rest of the day until I picked my kids up from school. (eerie music) - Man, that was an incredible amount of information. I feel so bad for that little girl Sabina, for the whole family, for that matter. It's amazing that Stephanie actually caught cell phone video evidence to show us. I mean, we all know what a rarity that is where the homeowner actually captures something on video to show us. And that video was amazing. I mean, you could hear those footsteps going right in front of her down the hallway approaching Sabina's room, opening the door. I just can't believe Stephanie actually went into the room after it and the bathroom. She's definitely got a lot of guts, you know? Being home alone like that, and kinda chasin' the thing around the house. This case is definitely a lot more imminent than I had originally thought. (cell phone ringing) It's actually Stephanie right now. Hey, Stephanie. Good, good, everything okay? Ah, yeah, yeah. Do you mind if I put this on speaker? We're actually documenting in the car right now, and I, is it okay if I put you on speakerphone? Okay. Stephanie, you there? - [Stephanie] Yeah. - Okay. - Can you hear me? - Yeah, I can hear you. - [Stephanie] Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah, the reason I was calling because I know that when we were talking earlier, there was something I was kind of hesitant to talk about. I'm not sure how relevant it would be, but I guess I was thinkin' about it and sayin' it's probably something that you might need to know. So, if you had a minute yet, I'd like to just tell you about another, I guess, issue we had when we were renovating the outside of the house. When we were trying to level our land here slowly because there were a lot of holes and low spots, and we were getting a lot of water. So, we brought someone in with a Bobcat, and we were, you know, taking the high spots and pushing them into the low spots. Only when we're doing that, we uncovered a large stone slab that was buried under the ground. - Okay. - [Stephanie] And, um, you know, we didn't think much of it, and we broke the stone slab up and moved it. And underneath that, we found a few bones that seemed to be of the human nature. And a partial insole of a shoe and a couple things that just didn't seem like they were animal bones, you know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, I definitely. What'd you guys do with the, with the remains, with the bones? - [Stephanie] You know, at the time, we just kind of, you know what, this looks like it maybe should be a spot we just don't touch. We put it back in the ground and buried everything back up. The biggest bone that we found that was more of an indicator of human, we found like a finger bone. And, you know, it, animals are shaped, I know, differently because they walk on all fours. This was clearly not an animal bone. - And you said there was like a large cement slab that. - [Stephanie] It was not cement. It was stone. - Stone, okay, yeah. So, definitely again another indicator of how old that, that grave would be. Makes you wonder if it was an old family cemetery on the property or? - [Stephanie] Yeah, I know. Given the age of the house, you know, we thought about, at the time did they just bury grandma and grandpa in the backyard? - Kinda makes you wonder if that's, I mean, did you notice any change in activity after you guys found those bones? - [Stephanie] (sighing) You know, I can't say that we did or didn't because when we found that we had, we weren't quite living in the house yet. - Okay. - [Stephanie] We were still renovating. It was before we moved in. - Alright, so, it may or may not have contributed to that. Wow. - [Stephanie] Right. But, yeah, I don't know how significant that really is, but I just thought that you probably should know. - Did you guys call the authorities when you located the bones? - [Stephanie] We did not because we just said, okay, we found 'em. We'll bury 'em. We'll just pretend like it didn't happen. - Wow, that really makes me wonder if that could be the contribution of this other thing that's in your house obviously besides the child spirit, Victor. - [Stephanie] Right. I mean, they could be. I'm just not sure. But, yeah, it's definitely something I, after thinking about it, I thought you should probably know. - Okay, definitely. We'll, we'll have to, you know, we'll factor that in to the research, and we'll get over there as soon as we possibly can. - [Stephanie] Alright. - Okay. All right, well, thanks for lettin' me know. And, again, if you can think of anything else at all or any more details about the bones in the yard, feel free to call me or text me, okay? - [Stephanie] Alright, absolutely. - Okay. - [Stephanie] You have a good night. - Alright, you too. - [Stephanie] Bye bye. - Bye. (cell phone beeping) Wow, I mean, literally we're right in the middle of talking about how chaotic and crazy this case is, and then she calls and says that. I mean, to me, there's no question that finding those bones, a body in the yard, and then, for all we know there could be multiple bodies. You know, maybe that's an old cemetery, who knows? Tomorrow's gonna be the first day. Bring in T.D. McRoy. Start to get that footage for the Iroquois technology, and let's just jump right into this investigation. (eerie music) - [T.D.] So, we definitely have joined forces with our research. Us CPI's as doin' the scientific side with the Iroquois technology and the dynamic filtration, and Haunted Saginaw doin' the research side. And we're bringin' this information together. This is the first step tonight of movin' to that next level. (suspenseful music) - So, of course, this is the second floor of the home. This is Sabina's room, which is the youngest daughter. And what is in this house seems to be very centered around her. - Well, just at a glance, clearly I haven't been in there. But a young teenage girl's room is very cluttered often. These entities seem to love clutter. It gives them a place to hide, you know what I mean? Because they're all about camouflage. I mean, they're the masters of it. You know, we have things in nature that are able to camouflage themself. Clearly, animals do it all the time. But in this next dimension, let's just call it, people are able to camouflage. - Have you ever been with a paranormal investigation team to actually acquire specific footage for Iroquois technology? I mean, we did that Finn Road, but remotely. You know, you told us what you wanted. We filmed it. We sent it to you. This time you're here, actually, physically here. - [T.D.] Right. - We could use that to our advantage. Adam's gonna be the one to film this. Is there any specific way that you want to film this to get the most result you possibly can? 'Cause we're really, really desperate to find out what's in this house and what's affecting this family, especially this little girl. - Well, to answer your first part of your question, have we ever been out to an investigation? The answer is no. I'm not really comfortable with bein' here. I was scared that I would actually see somethin'. And, honestly, I don't wanna see anything. - I can sense you're very nervous. - Oh, I'm completely nervous. - Do you have any specific instruction with how you want him to film? And then, we're just gonna go ahead and do a walk through. - Yeah, I mean, if you can just kind of follow me, and, you know, and I can kinda tell you how it would work. Basically, we always start on the right side of a room when you come in. So, and even though you're heading to the right side of the room, you wanna work your way around. But you always want to have the camera pointed to the center of the room. So, you come in, and you pan around. And once you start comin' to the center of the room. Right, you pan back to the center, and then you will walk your way around. And always pause when you get to an area that is blocked off, like a corner, some place that has three side to it. You always wanna pan that area, hit that, and then continue on. One, two, three sides, pause, hit that, and continue on over. You do the same thing here. You always count one, two, three, pause, pan. So, you continue around the room, and when you get back towards the doorway, you wanna work your way back towards the center again. And then, when you come out, back your way out of that room. Because what happens is, when we come up the steps, they all wanna see what's goin' on. And what's interesting is they don't, they look with a different set of eyes than we do. They no longer have a visual cortex that's in the back of our heads. With this vision, they don't have to use their eyes to look around corners. They do it because it's human nature to do that. - And this is from all your years of experience. You've seen this. You know how it is they try to avoid detection. - Yeah, this room, I'm almost positive that we'll get somethin' out of this room, just because, once again, you see, not a messy room. We just, had just, it just has a lot of clutter. - There's so many places to hide here. - Absolutely, and, listen, they don't. We're not gonna run them out of here. - [Steve] Right. - So, they'll just hide. And camouflage. Let me go this way. So, when I came up here to look around earlier, I didn't wanna look at much because I'm not a ghost hunter. You know, I'm a researcher, and as a researcher, I like my job. I like that task. As a kid, I mean, Scooby Doo scared me. So, you can imagine to come to a real ghost house. So, a hallway like this is good to catch 'em in because why? It's long, and it's a good place for them to travel between. For some reason, they like hallways. And sometimes a hallway will be just that, a place to get away. So, but thank you. - [Steve] Ah, for sure, for sure. We'll get that footage to you right away. - Yep, let me know how it happens. (eerie music) (ominous music) - I thought of something that I don't believe I told you originally, something that we found about a year after we bought the house. We were going to be putting some new GFIs in our bathroom, and when trying to locate the power source, we weren't able to originally find it looking in the basement. There was no way to access under the bathroom. So, we found this closet. There was some linoleum on the floor here. And we pulled it up, and we found this access right here. And when we pulled it up, we found just this big hole. We think maybe it was used as a cistern for the original house. My two sons, when they were probably eight or nine, they climbed down in here and came across a man's shoe. We thought that was odd. It shouldn't be down there. And a couple minutes later, they pull up a woman's shoe, and that was when we decided, you know what, maybe you should just get out of there and stop diggin'. We don't want you to be findin' anything else that may be down there. - And this can't be accessed through the basement or any other part of the house? - You can't, no, nope. You can't access it from outside, inside. The only way you can access some plumbing and some of the electrical is through this panel, and to completely cover it up, it's kind of odd. - And after the bizarre discoveries from your children, you pretty much told them no more. - Yeah, no more, and, yeah, we closed it up. And nobody's been down there since. And that was like 10 years ago. How or why all of this would be down here. - [Steve] Yeah, that doesn't quite add up, does it? - [Stephanie] No, it doesn't. - [Steve] I think that needs to be explored. (mellow rock music) - So, I'm gettin' ready to go underneath the house in what the family describes as a cistern that they found while trying to upgrade the electrical in the first floor bathroom. When they lifted the floor, lifted this flooring up, they found an access hole. The kids went down into the space. Evidently, at some point, they found some shoes, and having found the bones in the yard prior to that, they were leery about lettin' the kids go back down there. Stephanie told them not to do that anymore. So, we're gonna go check it out. We think it's very odd to the case and might have something, it might yield some evidence for us. So, I'm gettin' ready to go down and check it out. (ominous music) - See? As soon as we got to this hallway, he stopped. I could not get his attention off of these stairs. I was here for a few minutes, and then I notice the temperature just completely dropped. I could probably almost see my breath. - [Steve] And his focus was right down these stairs? - [Jamie] Yes. - Was there any other type of sounds? Or was there anything that went in conjunction with this or? - It kinda sounded like someone was down on the landing area down there, like shuffling type of scratching sound, but other than that, not really. - My name is Steve. This is my friend Jamie. We have a special guest here tonight, Archer. Were you gonna come up and maybe pay him a visit? Maybe pet the dog? Is that what you were tryin' to do? It's okay. (suspenseful music) Can you come up the stairs here and communicate with us? (Adam sighing) - Wow, look at all the old paint cans and broken glass. This is insane. I'm gonna set my camera down. Check this out some. Some old paper, let's check that out. "Fire on Brockway Street, accident." No date on it. This here. "Carbon tetrachloride. "Poison, danger." - We are friends of the family that currently own the house, Tom and Stephanie Braley. We're gonna be spending a lot of hours here, many, many days. So, if you're curious about who we are and what we're doing, you could simply communicate with us, try to contact us. Can you tell me your name please? We introduced ourselves. Who are we trying to contact? Who are we speaking with? - Look at this, pruning shears. These are newer. Stephanie said it'd been over 10 years since somebody's been down here. Bizarre. Just a lot of old, broken glass. This is crazy. I think I found the old shoe. It's old leather. It has to be 70, 80 years old. Oh, look at that. Scratches all over the wall. - You know, it's not very nice to rattle this door and do this kind of thing because the people that are in there are trying to sleep. And it scares them. Are you trying to cause turmoil? - These scratches all run up and down. They're all vertical. I wonder if these pruning shears. Oh, they've been there a while too. Pruning shears don't make that. They're about two and a half feet off the, off the floor. Two feet. They're not consistent with an animal though. They're not. There's no pattern to it. You know, there's no three or four. There's no paw or claw that's makin' that. I wonder if it's glass. Oh. (scraping sound) (glass clattering) Oh, my God. I wonder if somebody was locked down here. These soup cans, is that how somebody ate? Why are all these soup cans down here? I wonder if this is why this was sealed up. If the previous owners here had sealed this up because they found it. Because maybe they were experiencing some of the same things in this house, and if they thought that this was a source of some of it, if they sealed it up, it'd go away, right? - Who are you? You need to identify yourself right now. What do you want with this family? With this house? Are you Victor? Are you the little boy that Sabina's seen? (door clattering) Holy shit. - [Jamie] Dude. - I hate to think what we're gonna find, but I think we owe it to the investigation to uncover what we can. As much as I don't want to, it's time to start diggin'. I'm gonna reposition this camera here. (suspenseful music) (shovel scraping) What is that? (shovel scraping) What is that? What do you suppose this is? - You know, I was pretty apprehensive about bringing Archer here tonight, but I've lived in haunted places before. And unfortunately for him, seeing spirits is nothing new. I figured I would just start by walking around the house and seeing if he hit on any specific areas. He went crazy when we got to the servant stairs in the back of the house. As soon as we got back there, he would not take his eyes off the bottom of those stairs and the landing around it. Animals in general have a sixth sense when it comes to these types of things. And even if you and I can't see it, they can. And it's there, and it's real. And now that we're out of the area, Archer is definitely relieved to say the least. (shovel scraping) - I'm finding a lot of the same thing in this spot here. It's all this slag and stuff, and I think we've found what we're gonna find there. I think, I think what we need to do is take what we found up and show Steve, and see where we go from here. (gentle piano music) So, Steve, what we found down there, it was really, really bizarre. There's no pattern to it to suggest that it's an animal paw or claw. It's really quite random, but all at the same height all the way across the wall. - So, that's fairly low. - It is very low. And it's hard to think of, but I think there was a kid locked in there. - You think there was a child locked down there? - I, I really think that there was a child locked down in there. - So, what supports that exactly? That's extremely interesting and very creepy. - Being a full grown adult, to get to that level to do that, I took a piece of glass that was on the floor, and I made a scratch in the wall. It resembled that, but it was very uncomfortable for me to get to that level. It'd be more consistent to me that somebody smaller would have been making that mark. And it almost made me wonder, you know, with all the soup cans and cans with different kinds of food. - I see where you're goin' with that. - Is (sighing). - That's disturbing. - It, you know, makes my skin crawl. - We need to enhance these pictures, get 'em blown up, really kinda study them. Tom and Stephanie definitely need to see this. (gentle piano music) (ominous music) So, after you had showed us the hole located in the closet, we decided to send Adam down there. There was a lot of very interesting things. I want you to take a look at these photographs of the walls of the hole. And tell me what you see. - Oh, my God. There are scratches everywhere, like gashes. Are they both the same? - Yes. - There are scratches all over the place. - So, you know, the first thought, I guess, one would have is could it have been a rodent, a raccoon, possum, whatever, some type of animal that could somehow get in there? - Oh, well, yeah, when you look at some of these, it looks like that could have been. - Right. - But when you see these ones, I mean, these are clearly not a rodent because they're, some are sideways. Some are up and down. - And there's no consistency. - There's zero consistency. - A paw or claw. - Like this, it's just, looks like somebody just. - Right, especially this area here. - Yeah, this one looks like what you'd see a little kid drawing with crayons. - It's funny you would say that. Beyond these items here, there was dozens and dozens and dozens of food cans. Was somebody kept there? - That would be, that would be horrifying to think that somebody was put down in that as a punishment or anything. - Right. - 'Cause I can only imagine. I mean, there is no way to get in or out other than that hole so it would be like complete darkness. - [Steve] Pitch black. - [Stephanie] And with all the broken glass and, that would just be horrifying. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (eerie piano music) - [Steve Gonsalves] So, you had said this is the son's bedroom. - Yep, this was the oldest son's bedroom. Actually, I believe both sons at one point had stayed up here in this house, and what's super interesting is this here is an addition. It's right over the garage actually. And this door here, they would say that 70 to 75% of every night that they slept in here, this door. They would have it closed. And they would hear this. (door rattling) Just something shaking it, shaking it. And then, sometimes they would say it sounded like something would run up and slam against it. - Oh, really? - Yeah. And they were terrified of this. - [Steve Gonsalves] Now, is this a violent shaking? Or is it, and did they see any of this action? - Yes, they would say that they would hear the doorknob, and sometimes when this light was on out here, they would see what looked like feet moving back and forth. For the longest time, they would run out there and try to catch it. The eldest son, when we interviewed him, he said he actually moved out because of this. And over here, him and his younger brother were playing video games here one night. TV right here. And they kept hearing crying outside. So, they would pause the game, kinda listen for a minute. Wouldn't here it, go back to playing. They heard it again. Well, about five minutes later, there's this huge bang that kinda shakes the house, and then the alarm system goes off. So, they grab what they could find as makeshift weapons. They come back here, open up the door, and as they're getting ready to go out here, the mom comes running in. And she thinks they set off the alarm. And after a few minutes, they realize that the youngest daughter, Sabina, hadn't come out. They wanna go check on her. And they run into the bedroom, open the curtains to her bed, and she's gone. They get outside, and she's walking right out into the street. So, the mom screams her name, and she kinda freezes up. They get out to the road, and they stop her. And even though it's mid-July, the weather's super hot. That's why the windows were open that they could hear the scream. They grab onto her, and she's ice cold. They believe that in this house there are two specific entities. One of them is the child spirit of a little boy named Victor. After they tried to use spirit boards and things of that nature to try and contact Victor, something else changed in the house. All of a sudden, you know, the doors are slamming. More aggression, completely different vibe. But at the same time, Victor remains. So, they believe possibly they opened up something by trying to communicate. You know, maybe there's something that wasn't good, or malicious, was taking her out, and perhaps something else in the house was trying to alert the family. - You know what would be pretty awesome? We should put the REM pod on the other side of the door. So, imagine if that started shaking. At the same time, the REM pod started going off. That would be quite a nice piece of evidence to let us know that there was something related to energy on the other side of the door. - Yeah, we can try that. Did you feel somethin'? - I did, yeah. I did actually. It was kinda bizarre actually. (object rolling on floor) - [Steve] Where would that even come from? - I don't know what that was or where that came from. - It looks like a little marble. - Well, where did this come from? I didn't see this anywhere. - I didn't either, and what's weird is it didn't sound like it fell and bounced. It kinda sounded like it just kinda came rolling. - All of a sudden, all of the sudden, exactly. It just started rolling. How'd that even happen? (ominous music) I was investigating the son's room with Mr. Shippy, and we decided to try to see what could possibly explain the fact that the door is shaking and slamming and what not. And not much can really explain that because the amount of force they're claiming to see. So, as we're messing with that door and trying to figure it out, I felt, to me what felt like some string behind my neck, maybe hitting it or a piece of cotton or something. I don't really know how to explain it. So, I just started to lean back to see if I could feel the sensation that I was feeling. And just then, a small marble started rolling straight forward, which was strange because if it had fallen to the floor, I most certainly would have heard that. And we all would have heard that distinct sound of it hitting the floor and maybe even bouncing a little bit, but it was literally just the roll. (REM pod alert sounding) (ominous music) So, this would be, I guess, where Victor would walk up. Are they just thinking that's what happened, or is she recalling that's what happened? - [Steve] No, she recalls that's what happened. - [Steve Gonsalves] She recalls that's what happened. - Absolutely. She became very terrified of her own bedroom and would see the little boy come into the room and stand basically right beside the bed. And she would just roll over or pull the covers over her face, you know, very afraid. And this went on several times. Again, once they started to use the spirit board, and things changed, they would hear really heavy footsteps coming up the hallway. And then, she would cover her face, you know, very fearful. So, she knew by, of course, the sound and just the whole demeanor of it, that it was something different. And then, the family basically out of desperation ask the bishop from the local Catholic church to come here. So, he comes up here, performs an entire blessing on the room, all the different corners, the dresser, and does what he does. And then puts, you know, the family at ease essentially. Then, when he leaves, the family walks him out, and they come up here. They go to put her to bed, and everything you see here, all of her dolls, all these pictures, mirrors, everything is all knocked down. So, they think everything's fine, everything's peaceful. Let's put Sabina to bed. Come up here, and then they have to see this. - [Steve Gonsalves] Everything is down. - So, needless to say, the peace of mind left very quickly. - There's so many layers. It's like an onion, you know. You really have to peel them all back and really get to the essence of what is going on 'cause there's so many variables. You know, maybe Victor was getting her out of here so that she wasn't dealing with what he interprets as the other, you know, spirits who are after him or whatever. Who knows? - [Steve] Yeah, trying to warn the girl, trying to warn the family. That's the thing is there's. - You never know. - So much to this case. There's a body in the yard. There is several confirmed deaths in the house. It all. (pounding sound) - What was that? (floorboards creaking) Hello? (ominous music) We're investigating in Sabina's room and just talking about how they communicated with Victor or supposedly communicated with Victor through a spirit board or a ouija board of some sort. And as we're discussing that and what Victor's intentions may have been, we started to hear some loud banging sounds. And, you know, what could that be? Could it have been footsteps? Could it have been just some sort of, you know, banging to get our attention? I'm not too sure, but it was loud. It was distinct. It was reverberating within the wood of this structure here in the house. And so, Steve and I, of course, went immediately towards these sounds, and once we got to the crest of the stairs there looking down the staircase, we heard what sounded like some shuffling or movement or as if something was, you know, approaching and sort of stopped. It was pretty interesting. We didn't get much more after that, but just that in and of itself. You know, what could that be? Something was alerting us. Something was trying to get our attention, and we need to figure out what that is. - [Steve] What is it? (crying) (ominous music) - So, while we were up here in the second floor doing my interview for the investigation we'd just done, we heard some crying or sobbing or moaning of some sort coming from downstairs. It was pretty awesome. It was pretty loud. And so, we decided to split up. Have one investigator go downstairs, that's Steve Shippy. You know, that puts somebody closer to the source, but also keeps somebody up here where we were just in case that's what triggered the sound. Then, having somebody down there that can be closer to it and hear it and analyze it will be valuable as well. - Why does it seem that every time we are in Sabina's room something seems to happen? Why do we hear footsteps? We've heard voices. We've heard crying. Is going into her room, is it, does it bother you? Does it bother you that Steve is in there right now? - Is there something about Sabina that draws you to her? Or is it this room? Do you not like people in this room, or do you not like people around Sabina? Oh. - There's been a lot of intrigue to your lure to Sabina. Is it protection? Or is there another reason? - [Steve Gonsalves] EMF is going a little, a little bonkers up here. - [Steve] I got a K-II meter here. I can turn this one on. - [Steve Gonsalves] It's still all under a 1.0, but it's still going from .2 to .7. This is a bit out of the ordinary. - Are you here with us tonight? Are you watching what we're doing? Wondering where Sabina went? - [Steve Gonsalves] Do you like it better when Sabina's here? - Maybe you're not even worried about Sabina. Is it Victor that you're more concerned with? We'd like to know what you're crying. I feel like you were definitely trying to get our attention with that. Are you sad that Sabina's gone, that the family's gone? Or does it have nothing to do with this family at all? (floorboards creaking) - Are you coming up to see me? I'm in Sabina's room. That's the upstairs bedroom. EMF just started fluctuating, .2 to 1.1. (floorboards creaking) - [Steve] Steve, you're not movin' around right now up there, are you? - No, but just as you say that, I just heard movement behind me. - Are you up there right now? Can you make somethin' move? (floorboards creaking) - Literally, I started hearing shuffling or some sort of movement behind me, and I turned my head to look in that direction. And then, you literally asked at that second, am I moving around up here? - [Steve] Yeah, down here it sounded like somebody was kinda quietly walking, and I didn't know if you'd gotten up to maybe see something. So, - No. - [Steve] I waited just a moment, but it didn't sound like you. I didn't hear your chair creak or anything else. (ominous music) (eerie piano music) - [Steve Gonsalves] After just being here for one night, you know, it's hard to draw any conclusions or really say anything other than, you know, we did have some experiences. I did hear footsteps walking right in front of me. So, if I had another, say, three or four days here or a week here, who knows what we would uncover? - Jamie, are you ready? Josh? Let's go. Victor, we have two very, very important messages to deliver to you tonight. Please come toward the sound of my voice and join us here in this room. (paper crinkling) "Victor, first of all, I would like "to thank you for sharing your home with us. "It must be very hard to have different people "coming and going from your home all the time. "Being so young when you passed away, "that is something I cannot imagine. "The extreme emotions that both you and your family "went through must have been overwhelming and horrific. "Did you not want to leave your family? "Is that why you still remain here? "Or do you have some unfinished business? "Whatever the reason, you are here. "Whether it's out of fear or confusion, "my heart breaks for you. "You have stayed and watched your loved ones move on, "grow old, and ultimately pass on. "So, in closing, I just want you to know "that no one here hates you or wishes that you would leave. "We just wish that you would find peace. "Love, Stephanie." This letter, Victor, is from Sabina. (paper crinkling) "Victor, hi, this is me, Sabina. "I know you're just young "and just a little boy in this house, "but I think you should try to find your parents. "I think they miss you, and you probably miss them too. "I hope you can find your family "and be happy, happier than you are now. "Good luck, Sabina." Victor, as you can see and hear, the family that lives here now, they care about you, very much. They don't know why you still remain, but the fact is you do. Stephanie and Sabina said that they tried to contact you, and they feel that you tried to communicate with them. And perhaps something stopped you. Charlie, no. Victor, Victor, are you here with us tonight? Is somebody else, someone like you in this house? Come on, Victor, you can communicate with us. All you have to do is move these pencils. Move the pencil to yes or no. We really, really wanna help you, to get you with your family and the people that love you and the people that you love. When Sabina and her mother were playing this game with you, they had asked the question, are there others here besides you? They said that the pencils started going to yes and then struggled back down and go back and forth. Was somebody trying to stop you from answering? Did you hear that? That was like rumbling. Victor, please, whoever's trying to stop you from answering the question, don't listen to them. Do not be afraid of them. Victor, are you here? (piano chord playing) Victor? That's it. You can communicate with us just like this. Can you hit it again? Hit it for yes. Victor, are you alone, or is there somebody else here with you? (noise from above) Upstairs. (beeping sound) (alarm clock beeping) (ominous music) - I'm very aware of something that's more, a little bit darker, and the energy that I keep feeling is that they're not real happy that there's this childlike loving energy that's here. - So, this is obviously Sabina's room. Tell me what, what you're feeling. - My hair is totally standing on end, like anxiety, and I can't breathe in here. When I walked in here, not only is the anxiety high, but it's almost like it's dead energy. It's dead air. - When we were comin' up the servant stairs, I noticed you kind of faltered for a minute and didn't say anything. What was going on there? - I hit that top step, and I was leaning forward. And suddenly, it was almost like something pushed me backwards, and I literally started losing my. Like, I almost fell all the way down the stairs. That wasn't an accident. That wasn't me being clumsy. That wasn't an accident. Something was trying to stop me at the top of those stairs. - What do you think it is? I mean, we know there's a child spirit in this house. I mean, at this point, (banging sound) what was that? - Did you just hear that? - Yes, that came from that way. - That was a loud thump. It sounds like somebody just walked through the door and let it slam. - You might wanna stand over here and be able to keep your line of sight that way. - Ah, yeah, because this is gettin' even crazier by the minute here. So, I'm gonna tell you. We've got the, we've got the child spirit, and it's a loving spirit. What I ran into, or what tried to push me down the stairs, and what I feel in here, (thumping sound) which is. - That shoe came off the rack. Are you guys getting that? That just came right off there right next to T. - He's here. He's standing in the doorway, and he stopped right in his tracks. (floorboards creaking) He's trying not to be noticed, and he stopped in his tracks. - Are you getting any kind of idea of what we're dealing with, what kind of spirit? Male, female? - He's a. He's definitely male. Tall, lanky, angry. He doesn't like the kids playing. He doesn't like the happiness. He doesn't like that the daughter interacting with the young child. He's innocent. This, he's not happy. He doesn't like it. He reminds me of an old, disgruntled man that, you know, shut up, you little kids. Be quiet, don't talk so loud. Don't play. He's just, he's not nice whatsoever. - Do you think he's dangerous at this point? - I would say that he borders 50/50. His patience wears thin real easy. And the energy, it's, it can be like kind of a brutal energy, a harsh, brutal energy of just anger. You know, somebody that is bitter, by themselves, doesn't have a. The light just went. - You okay? (Adam sighing) Are you alright? - [Kelly] Adam, I swear you were just now gettin' ready to pass out. - And this light just burned out at the same time. - [Kelly] And it totally just burned out. - Right here, get this. (Adam exhaling) What did you feel? - [Josh] You need to sit down? - Yeah, sit, here, sit down for a quick second. - Holy mackerel. - [Steve] Here, we got this. Can you hold that for me? - [Kelly] Yep. - [Steve] What happened? - I was watching in the screen. And somethin', somethin' came through the screen. Something black came right across the front of my, between me and the screen. - We're getting a little too close to the truth. This is what exactly what he's letting me feel is that we're getting a little too close to the truth, and he doesn't want it. He doesn't want it explained. - I asked you a moment ago if this thing was dangerous, and you were kind of on the fence. - He's building energy. - [Steve] What did you see exactly? - It was, excuse me. Right between where I'm holding the camera, right between me and the camera, it almost like. (noise like a moan) - What the hell was that? - [Adam] What is that? - That was a disembodied voice. That was a groan. Ah, you know what, from the closet. - [Steve] It was like a wailing. - I'm gonna tell ya, it's gaining momentum. - I mean, you were almost pushed down the stairs, and then this happens to Adam just moments later. - You need to be very cautious because I really feel like he's going to start hitting on each person individually, little by little by little, almost like plucking off the prey. You need to really, really be careful with this one. So, immediately when coming up the stairs, not only was I, I feel like I was totally attacked. Something was trying to prevent me, if not trying to push me backwards down the stairs. So, with that, I automatically became rattled, and then we walk into this room. This room, the energy is heavy, almost as if you can't breathe. Totally overwhelmed, and just a high anxiety. So, as we're standing there, next thing you know, the shoe drops out of nowhere. There was no way that that shoe would have just automatically have fallen off the shelf by itself. Why not before? Why not after? No, there was something going on that was trying to get our attention. So, we've got several things going on here. Then, next thing you know, the camera man, like something almost knocked him down. He gets, you know, completely, ghostly white and thinks he's gonna pass out. What the hell was that? We hear this loud bang downstairs. Something is clearly trying to alert us. Not only is it there, but it's gaining momentum. - [Adam] It's pulling on my arm. - You guys, this is crazy. This is crazy. - [Steve] It's, there's, his hand is like freezing cold. - He, he doesn't want the truth to be told. This is crazy. - What are you? So, what happened upstairs in Sabina's room, I've never felt like that before. I've never felt like, it felt like something passed through me. There were moments leading up to that for about a minute and a half that I don't recall. I lost all track of what was going on. So, we continued from the bedroom out into the hallway to talk to Kelly some more about what happened in the room. I could feel a hand on my wrist pulling. It didn't just pull my hand away. It pulled my hand behind me. And it was such a strong pull that I actually lost my balance and fell backwards onto the step. I was being pulled by something that was a stronger force than myself. It's a scary thing, and I really am fearful for what's gonna happen goin' forward. (ominous music) - The master bedroom here is extremely important as this was the specific location where the very first sighting of an apparition, a ghost, was witnessed by a member of the family. Here on the floor in front of us. All of these toys that we have brought here are our attempt to try to get Victor to come out here and possibly interact with some of these, as these items go back to a specific time period, which would have been during his life. Victor, are you here with us this evening? We have a gift, or several gifts, for you. Would you like to come in here and play? Can you tell me, perhaps, why you were looking out this window? Was there something out there that maybe caught your attention? Maybe you were just watching the cars go by. Perhaps, watching the people on the sidewalk go up and down Brockway. When you turned to look at Sabina, I kinda think that maybe you did that to let her know that, indeed, you could see her. Maybe you felt a connection because the two of you were closer in age. Maybe you just wanted to, to get her attention. It's amazing when I think about it though. Like, for a girl that was four or five years old to describe something that was translucent and no feet floating, which was classic, classic apparition sightings, it gives me chills. It really does, especially standing right here where he was at. I mean, at the end of the day, for anybody, child, adult, that would be terrifying. (door slamming) Go. That was open. That was the door. Victor? (Steve sighing) Victor, are you here? Please don't be afraid. Did you slam the door? Were my questions upsetting you? Please don't stop communicating with us. Oh, my heart's goin' right through my chest. That was a pretty loud slam for being a child spirit. (dramatic music) (shoes squeaking) What's goin' on? What's wrong? - [Jamie] (breathing hard) It felt like some. Check my hair back here. Is there a scratch or anything? It felt like something. - It's red. - [Jamie] Pulled my hair, or, it hurts. - [Steve] Here, take this, take this. Give me the flashlight. Turn around. - [Jamie] Do I have a mark or anything? - [Steve] Just turn around. Let me see. Move your hair please. - [Jamie] It's like right here somewhere. - [Steve] Hold on. It's not focusing. Um, yeah, there's some, there's somethin' there. - [Jamie] What? - [Steve] It's, it's not, it's, ah, here. - [Jamie] What is it? Is it bleeding? - [Steve] I don't know that it's bleeding, but there's definitely a spot there. Oh, my God. What did you feel? - I was just recording you, and it felt like something rushed up behind me and then pulled my hair. And next thing I knew, my neck felt like it was on fire. - [Steve] This is not a child spirit. - [Jamie] No. - Look at the height. I mean, you're almost what, six feet tall, and it scratched the back of your neck or whatever or burned it. Who is up here with us? Who are you? (gentle eerie music) Are you alright? - (breathing hard) I'm just a little freaked out right now. - [Steve] Let me see it under the light. Let me see it under the light. Aw, man, that's bad. That looks more like a, a burn than a scratch. Jamie, you don't have to finish this investigation right now if you don't want to. Do you wanna go downstairs, or do you wanna? (suspenseful music) - No. (REM pod alert sounding) - Master bedroom. - [Jamie] Oh, my God. - Victor? (ominous music) Victor, we'd like to play a game with you tonight. I'm pretty sure you're familiar with me by now. My name is Steve, as I've said before. This is my good friend Jamie, Josh, and Tim. We're gonna play hide and seek. All of us are gonna split up and chose a different room to go sit and wait for you. Please do not be afraid of us. We know you've shown yourself to several members of the family, specifically Sabina. Tonight we're simply here just to play with you, interact with you, and perhaps find out why you're here. So, tonight, this is all about you. Now, let's play. All of you guys, be careful. Let's split up, and let's go. As soon as something happens, if it does, get on that radio and call for backup, okay? Let's do it. (recorder beeping) - This is Jamie in the back hallway of the Brockway mansion. Hide and seek investigation. Hey, Victor? I don't think I need to introduce myself. We've been here many nights and have investigated many hours. You probably know more about us than we think you do. I really hope you don't mind us being here every night. I know you're probably not used to this routine and the fact that the family's been gone, especially Sabina. I know that you are very attached to her. - I had the honor of meeting the new owners, Tom and Stephanie. He told me that you have a fondness for their youngest daughter, Sabina. He said that she was the first one to see you. I'd like to see you. They really put a lot of money and care into renovating this place. I hope that pleases you. I hope that doesn't upset you by making it different from what you're used to 'cause they genuinely love this place. - Victor, if you're out there, come over towards where my light is in the hallway here. Got this device here. It's like a toy. You could come over. You could touch it, and it'll light up. It makes all kinda cool noises. And it'll let me know if you're standin' out there. I think I hear you creepin' around out there. Come in here. Come find me. You do, you win the game of hide and seek. - This is Steve, second floor, hide and seek investigation of the Brockway mansion. Victor, this is a huge, huge house. So many different rooms, corridors, multiple staircases. I thought it would only be fitting that we'd play a game of hide and seek with you. I'm sure you played hide and seek many times in this huge, beautiful, old house. What's you favorite place to hide? - You know, Victor, I was here with Steve when he was talkin' to the family about you, hearing all their stories. And when he asked them what they hoped we'd accomplish by being here, they just wanted us to help you. They don't wanna hear you crying. They don't want you to be lonely or scared. Stephanie told us a story that happened before they even moved in. They were just doing renovations, and one of the very first things that ever happened was they heard you crying all throughout the house. And Stephanie, being a mother, it really breaks her heart to know that that's going on here. She just really wants to help you, and so do we. - I flew here all the way from a place called Denver. It's 1200 miles away. But I'm originally from Saginaw, just like you. I'm only here for tonight. And it would be nice to meet you. I hope it's me that you come visit. (floorboards creaking) Victor? Is that you? God, I really hope that's Victor. - Victor, if you are here, and you can hear me, I need to know if it was indeed you that was communicating with Stephanie and Shelby when they were using the spirit board trying to communicate with you specifically. Was it you spelling out V-I-C? - You know, Victor, I'm really sorry that I'm sitting here talking about all this sad stuff because I know we're here tonight to have fun. We're here to play a game. In fact, I brought you something. Easter's coming up. So, I brought you an Easter basket. I made the Easter basket myself. I tried to pick out things that I thought you might like. There's toys, chocolate, even a stuffed rabbit. I've never made an Easter basket for anyone before. Pretty soon I'll get to make one for my niece Lana. It's her first Easter this year. But this Easter basket, this is the first one I have ever made. Just do me a favor, Victor, don't tell the other guys I did this 'cause technically this is cheating. - Victor? I really hope it's me you come to find. I traveled a real long way just to meet you. I sure would love to tell my friends back in Colorado that it was me you came to see. - [Josh] Hey, Tim? - [Tim] What? - [Josh] Got a phone charger? - No. You scared the shit out of me. - [Josh] Sorry. - Victor, if there's anything you can tell us about the man or the monster that is in this house that's scaring you, leading Sabina out into the street in the middle of the night, that could help us remove him, identify him. So, please, if there's anything you can say, if you can give us a verbal response, we can help you. - You know, Victor, I really thought this Easter basket was gonna work. I thought it was me you were gonna come and find. I've got candy, little green army men. I've even got a toy fire truck. You can roll it around on the floor. Push it back and forth. You just gotta come in here. (Jamie sighing) (dog barking) (REM pod alert sounding) (banging sound) - Victor, we really, really wanna communicate with you. - [Jamie] Guys, I've got activity down here. He just walked right past me, through me. (walkie talkie beeping) - Where is it now? - [Jamie] He went through the door behind me. He's in the living room. - Do you have visual confirmation? (walkie talkie beeping) - [Jamie] The stairs leading up to Tom's office. (walkie talking beeping) (soft crying) (door opening) (Steve exhaling) - Jamie, it was just the cat. Oh, my God. (REM pod alert sounding) (door slamming) Everybody up to the office now. Hurry up. (walkie talkie beeping) What is your name? Because I know you are not Victor. Victor didn't slam that door with that kind of force. Whoever you are, you're not intimidating me. Leave this family alone. - [Josh] What's goin' on? - Josh, listen, when Jamie got on the radio and said that she heard. (footsteps pounding) When you said that you heard something coming up the stairwell here, that was only the cat, okay? - [Jamie] No, no, that was not the cat. That's, what I heard sounded like heavy boot steps coming up the stairs. - Okay, well, the cat came popping out of there. It ran right down the hallway, okay, but a few moments later when I went to sit back down to continue the EVP session, the K-II meter in the doorway goes off. I turn my attention to it. The door right there behind you slams shut. That was not Victor, not with that kind of force. I'm telling you right now. (quiet eerie music) No more splitting up. From now on, we gotta stick in pairs or stick together, however. This is starting to get dangerous. Do you understand? - I agree. - Where the hell is Tim? - [Jamie] He's back down in the command center grabbing another camera. - Alright, well, let's not leave him alone. Just pop out this SD cards real quick. Everybody meet in the command center, okay? Be careful. (quiet eerie music) (ominous music) So, the reason I wanted to talk to you guys in my office before we get to the location tonight is we know that whatever's in that house is always listening. It's always watching. And obviously I'm not talking about Victor. What we encountered last night, which you encountered in that hallway, what came up the stairs, what slammed the door on me, was not Victor. Now, Josh, I believe when you were in the room that you were in, and you were hearing the little footsteps. And you thought you were seeing a little shadow, I think you were about to encounter Victor. Or should I say you did encounter Victor? Now, what you dealt with in the hallway, do you believe that was Victor? - Not at all. - And what did it feel like? - It was a very heavy, heavy feeling that was very angry when it passed through me. - I mean, whatever's there is angry. It is negative, and we're running out of time. We need to find out what this thing is, and I don't know that we can get rid of it. I think it's at least our job to try to find out what it is, who it is, what attachment there is to the house, and how the hell to get rid of the damn thing. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you guys here is because tonight I'm gonna try something, okay? When we try to contact Victor, it always comes out. So, we're gonna go there tonight under the guise that we're trying to contact Victor, knowing that Victor's not the one that's going to come out. But I need to tell you guys this right now. What's gonna happen tonight, you have to trust me. I don't wanna talk about it right now, and I definitely don't wanna talk about it in the house. I've got a plan we're gonna put in motion. We need to draw this thing out and try to get some kind of conclusion to what we're dealing with. Alright, let's get goin'. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) Jamie, are you rolling? - [Jamie] Yes. - Victor, last night we played a game, a game of hide and seek. But then it dawned on me today when I got up, we never finished. It is your turn to hide, and the three of us will be the seekers. We know that you know this home way better than we could ever imagine. So, it's gonna be a challenge. So, right now, run off to your favorite spot in the house. Pick your best hidin' place, and perhaps one of us will find you. Alright, guys, I want you to head out right here. Go and search the property. Check the out buildings. See if maybe you can find Victor. - [Jamie] Outside? - Yeah, I'm gonna take the house. You guys go right out here, come on. Just go ahead and head out the front door. - But? - I got it. Everything's fine. (Josh sighing) Let me know if you find him. (lock snapping) (ominous music) (pounding on front door) (pounding on front door) All right, Victor, ready or not. (knocking) (knocking) Here I come. (knocking) You'd better be hiding. (knocking) And I bet you I know exactly where to start first. (door creaking) - Damn it. I don't get it. Yesterday he's telling us, everybody needs to stay together. Always be partnered up. Nobody's allowed to go off on their own with all the investigating going the way it's been recently. And here he goes all by himself, locks the door (sighing). It's just a bad idea. I'm callin' him. (floorboards creaking) - [Steve] Are you in here, Victor? I know this is one of your favorite rooms. (curtain swishing) - [Steve's Voicemail] You've reached Steve with Haunted Saginaw. - Really? - [Steve's Voicemail] Paranormal Investigation. Please leave a detailed message after the beep, and I'll get back with you at my earliest convenience. Thank you. - [Josh] I'm gonna try a different door. - [Steve] Ah, creepy ass house. I thought for sure you would've been up here. All the reports of sightings and activity in this room. I know how fond you are of Sabina, Victor. Why don't you come on out? Alright, one by one, every room in this house, I'm gonna come and find you. I know it seemed kind of rude locking my friends out, but I just want it to be you and I tonight. It's fun, isn't it? Come out, come out, wherever you are. (doorknob rattling) (doorknob rattling) - Aw, fuck. There's a door on the other side. - [Steve] Victor? Are you in here? (door creaking) (door creaking) (Steve sighing) If I were a kid, where would I hide? Man, you sure picked a good hiding spot, Victor. Victor. (curtain swishing) (Steve sighing) (dog whining) (dog whining) What the hell is that? (dog whining) The dog. You're shaking. Are you down here? It's okay, Hector. It's okay, dog. It's okay. What do you guys see? Come on out and show yourself. What do you see? What? (floorbaord creaking) (dog barking) What is your name? Who are you? The family was not trying to contact you using the spirit board. I don't care if they didn't properly close out. They want to end communication with you now. They want to close now. Leave this house. Leave this property. Do you understand? Go, go away. You're not welcome here, not wanted here. This it it. Leave this house. Quit tormenting (dog barking) that little child, Victor. Quit terrifying Sabina. Go. (pounding on door) (suspenseful music) - Okay, Steve, you know what happened. You end up sendin' me, I think you sent us like four different clips. So, we started in the basement. So, we'll go right here and start. We call this one the basement mist. And what happens is, let me set it up. You end up walkin' around a corner, and Iroquois gets a hit. So, we go back, run it through again. You go around a corner. We don't see anything. We run it through again. We get another hit in the same location. So, we'll go ahead and play it. So, right there we see this mist, okay? Doesn't look like much to us. So, we use our dynamic filtration on it. And when you look, you can actually see, very faintly, see what looks like maybe a female that has, stickin' her head out. It's hard to see. We thought this was important to put in there because the Iroquois technology has the ability to show some of the most incredible images that the world's ever seen. But it also has the ability to show images that are a little faint. We just want you to know, and everybody to know, everything that Iroquois technology hits on is not gonna be this, you know, smoking gun of an apparition. So, we just wanna make sure people understand. This is scientific research, but we'll always, we'll try to bring you the best that we have. The playmate (sighing). This one's pretty interesting. This is the upstairs bedroom. So, let's go ahead and play it. Fascinating. So, we just go through the first time. And then, we'll go back, and we'll hit the, hit it with the Iroquois technology. So, we hit in that area. (ominous music) So, immediately it doesn't look that bad to us, but you'll see for a second that it's dark there. Now, we apply the dynamic filtration, and right there you can see that the face comes out. You got the left eye, the right eye, the nose kind of pointing right here. Our final conclusion is that is a little boy we think mixed in with some other people. Alright, um, (sighing) this guy that we're gettin' ready to show you, he is with a little boy, and he's standin' behind the little boy. Entities that stand in front of children are someone who is protective of those children, but human nature always remains the same. Parents, adults stand in front of children. They don't stand behind 'em. The only, we only see that if we think the adult is somehow manipulating or using the child. This gentleman that we're gonna show you is behind the little boy that we just showed you before. And in 14 years of research, that is a problem. Can you see him okay? - [Steve] Oh, yeah. - I didn't tell you this, but when I was here last time, I was sitting right over there in that chair. You guys were in the kitchen, and I was in this room by myself. And I looked over at the corner over here where the bookshelves and the fireplace is, and I saw a head and shoulders directly in front of me. I had only seen these images on my computer, but here I was face to face with his shadow. And I'm lookin', I'm like, is that a shadow? This is the problem. When I was staring at it, that shadow is a veiling glare. These entities look just like you and me. Whenever you see a shadow, they are creating that because they don't want you to know who they are. But this is what I saw. I saw the face, and I saw the white coming through. He wanted me to see him. He did that on purpose. - You couldn't be more correct when you say that it's certainly not protecting the child spirit in this house. It's definitely oppressing that spirit, and it's also a danger to the family. - [T.D.] Do you know about this guy? - Oh, yeah. We definitely know about this guy. The family when they first moved into the house, they started renovations, and almost immediately they were hearing crying and weeping. It sounded like a child. The mother of the home, Stephanie, would travel around trying to find where the sound was coming from. It was completely omni-directional. She would go one way. She'd go another. It would still be the same volume regardless of where she went. Not long after that, this little spirit started to appear to the youngest daughter, to other people in the family. Hand prints on the mirror like a small child. This continued and continued. And then, when the youngest daughter had physically seen the boy, then they were adamant to find out who is this kid that is haunting the home, what's happening? So, they started doing research on the home. They get some death records, other materials, but then unfortunately at some point, they had the idea to use a spirit board and try and contact the spirit to find out who it was. So, it started to spell out V-I-C and continued to spell out V-I-C. Well, for a moment they were thinking perhaps it was trying to spell out Victoria. And then, they thought there was another spirit in the home until the death records finally came in and a Victor, - Holy. - Yeah, a Victor passed away here in the home. So, that's what V-I-C was. - A young boy? - A young boy. - Like what we just saw? What I just showed you? - Yes, and where you found it is where it's been seen multiple times. In Sabina's room. She has sensed him standing by the bed near her many times. It's very attached to her, and I think it's because when she moved in here, they were similar in age. But then once they used the spirit board, something else was introduced in the home. The activity started to change. You know, slamming doors, more aggressive behavior. They believe that this individual, this thing, led Sabina out in the middle of the night and was leading her to the road. And you see how busy this road is here. - Right. - She wasn't sleepwalking. She was aware the whole time. (loud thump) Did that come from up here? Was that on this floor? Give me it. Give me the camera. (suspenseful music) - What the was that? Holy freak. (ominous music) - I saw something a couple days ago, you know, when you guys were here. You had just left. That I thought that you guys might find interesting. If you wanna come this way, I'll show you. You know how you guys left. It was pretty late. And about five minutes after you left, I was in here sitting on the chair. I was gonna text my mom and tell her I was on my way. I was just sitting here. And I kept hearing something upstairs. My daughter was asleep on the couch. And so, after hearing it for about a minute, I got up and went over there to see if I could hear it better, and I was actually able to record the very end of what I heard since I had already had my hand, my phone in my hand. So, I can actually show you what I got on tape if you guys would like to see that. - That'd be great. - This is actually what I heard. At first, I thought I was hearing maybe the printer or something trying to go, but when I got closer. (creaking sound) You could hear the very end. Of that, and for me. - [Steve] So, is that the staircase, or? - Well, at first I thought, oh, my gosh, that's the door opening. So, that really freaked me out. It took me a few minutes to get up enough courage to actually go up there. And then, when I went to, I found out the door was closed, so I went to open it. And then, I thought it was the floor because the top step is really creaky. The next day my daughter and I were here, and I let her listen to it. And she said, "Ah, no, that's dad's chair in his office." So, we went up, and I sat in his chair and moved around a little bit. And it is actually his chair that you hear and not the door or the floor. - [Steve] And you're sure of that? - Yeah, I mean, I can actually go ahead and just show you what it sounds like. - [Steve] Yeah, that'd be great. - And you guys can hear if it sounds like that to you. - [Steve] You wanna head up there with her? And I'll stay down here and hear if it sounds the same to me. - [Jamie] Sure. - [Steve] And you were recording right here at the bottom of these stairs? - Yeah, I was at the bottom of these stairs. This would be the chair, and if you sit in it, and you lean back, it's not too bad. But when you go to get out, (chair creaking) I mean, you can hear, it's pretty much. (chair creaking) - [Steve] That's the same sound. - The same sound. - [Steve] It's exactly the same. - So, that's what I actually heard the other night, and it was literally not even five minutes after you guys left. It's kind of, it was like, it felt like it was trying to taunt me, scare me intentionally, right after you guys left. (suspenseful music) - [Steve] So, why do you think it would choose that location in the house, I mean, Tom's office? - You know, at the time I really didn't think much of it. It wasn't until actually a couple days after I saw the image that we saw of. - [Steve] Okay, from the Iroquois technology? - Yes. After seeing that, a couple days after that, I kept thinking, gosh, it looks like somebody. Why does, who is that? 2:30 in the morning I sit up, and I go, oh, my gosh. I know who this is. And when I just thought about the timing from when everything started and all the things that led up to that. We had a friend in the family that we kinda had a falling out, and we never really got to reconcile before they passed away. That's who I think it is. - So, the image looked that much like this person? - Yes, to me, it did. And, yeah, like I said, we never got to reconcile. There was some, you know, bad feelings at the time they passed. And that was right about the same time shortly before things started to get really weird here. - The activity that's been taking place, does that, I mean, does that also have any hallmarks of this person? I mean, now that you're putting it together? - Well, yeah, yeah, I mean. The people that it seems to be going after are the people that they had a problem with. And, you know, you know, really focusing on our daughter kind of says, we're gonna mess with the one thing that's important to you. It sounds like that's something that they would do. - Wow. I mean, I'm kinda speechless right now. That pretty much changes the direction of everything we've been looking into. We thought perhaps through the spirit board, through the grave dug up outside. - That was actually what we had thought, or I had thought for a while, but after seeing the, the Iroquois image, then going back through the timing of when everything started, it actually makes the most sense to me because the timing is almost perfect. - Well, we had, we had something planned tonight that I was gonna do alone, but I'm almost wondering with this revelation if maybe you would join me with it. It's kinda hard to explain, but would you? - (chuckling) Okay, it depends what it is. - [Steve] Why don't we show her actually? - [Jamie] Yeah. - [Steve] Yeah, here, come with me. - [Stephanie] Okay. (eerie music) - Stephanie, first of all, thanks for agreeing to sit here and do this with me. I had already planned on doing this, but when you revealed the information that you revealed to us tonight, I think you're gonna be the key here. Obviously, we don't know the person which you're speaking about or exactly what the circumstances are. But if you are that sure after seeing that image that it is that person, and perhaps the grievances, or the vendetta, there match some of the actions in the house, I feel like you're key. So, I guess we can go ahead and start with that one there. Victor, while we were setting up in here, Stephanie had thought she saw somebody around your height peeking in the hallway around a semi-open door. And moments ago, I thought I had seen something over here peeking behind this other easel. So, if you're here with us, that's great because we have a message from Stephanie here who would like to speak with you and really tell you her feelings and her family's feelings about you being here in this house. - Well, first, you know, nobody here hates you or anything like that. I mean, obviously, we have, you've done things that have startled Sabina especially. We prefer you to be with your family. I just know that, you know, if he were my son, I would definitely want him to come to wherever I was. I would love for him to just go to be with his family. I would think that would make him so much happier than being here with us since, you know, we don't really know him. - We really feel it's time for you to go and be with others that are like you because I promise you there'll be way more people there than there are here. Family, friends, there's a lot more than the 6000 plus square feet in this home. All that being said, when it comes to Victor, you don't feel the same about what else is in this house. - No, no, not at all. (gentle piano music) - So, if you would like to. (somber instrumental music) - [Steve] It's disturbing to even look at. - Yes, yes, it is. Oh. - You know, to me, the image is, it is disturbing. It's scary, but I can't imagine what you go through because you know who that looks like to you. And you've basically matched it, you know, identically with photos of said individual with the composite of this. So, how does this make you feel? - It's disappointing. I don't know. You would think in death you would want to be at peace. Instead you would go somewhere and create unrest for other people and not let yourself find that peace. And it's, it's disappointing that it would choose to use Sabina as the main tool. Sabina is young. She doesn't understand. As a parent, I'm sure, as a parent you know that it wouldn't matter what anybody did to you. You could deal with it. But when they start messin' with your kids, why would you choose to come and disturb and just be so angry still instead of going and crossing over and finding peace. Everything is in the past now. We don't hold any grudges, any vengeance. I'm not angry about anything that transpired. Sometimes people say things and do things that they regret later. Sometimes, you know, you don't get the chance to say, I'm sorry. And you hope that they in their last moments forgave you, and it doesn't feel like that happened. You know, to think that something would take my child and possibly harm them like that. I can't imagine somebody being that angry. - I think we both know that whatever else is in this house is always watching. It always is aware. Would you care to try to maybe address the room if you will and really let it know how you feel and where you stand? - Okay, well, I guess the first thing that you need to know is we don't, we don't harbor any ill will. Things happen. People say things. People do things. We don't have any animosity, any ill will, or anything, even for the things that have happened since then. You're angry, I get it. And you need, you need to go. You need to go, cross over. You need to go find peace. You need to leave the family alone. You can't stay here. Sabina deserves better. We deserve better, and you deserve better. So, you just need to go. - Listening to what you just said, it seems that you're very adamant about this, which you should be. And I know that there is some anger there, but I also hear that there's forgiveness there. - Well, it's not so much, it's anger, but not really. It's not anger. It's, it's scares the heck out of Sabina, you know? I just want her to able to go to sleep in her room and not have to be scared about where she's gonna end up by morning. I mean, that's not fair to her. And so, it's not so much anger. It's just fear for my child. - For anybody watching this out there that is skeptical of the paranormal, of ghosts being real, what would you say to them? - That was me. I was the skeptic. When you experience it, it's a whole different, it's a whole different ball game. - So, where do we go from here? We're gonna be out of this house tonight. We've been here for weeks, you know, with the preliminary investigation and all the nights of investigating. How do you feel knowing that we're gonna leave, and you guys are gonna, you know, come back to the house? - You know, it's a little apprehensive. I know Sabina's not super excited. You know, after seeing that, you know, just the image alone for her was enough to, to terrify her. But, you know, hopefully, they reflected and said, you know, maybe it is my time to go. That's what our hope is. - Well, we're always one phone call away. I guess in closing, for anybody out there that is dealing with something like you guys are dealing with, what word of advice would you give to an individual or a family living with a haunting? - When you get something like this, my best advice is try to find somebody to help you get it, get rid of it because it doesn't get better. Ignoring it doesn't make it go away. Pretending it's not there doesn't make it go away. Find somebody that will help you make it go away. (ominous music) (eerie music) (intense dramatic music)
