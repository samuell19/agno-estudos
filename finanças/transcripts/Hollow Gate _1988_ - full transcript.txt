Look, and we just got to stop and get a little gas OK? Gas? You have a full tank. You know what's up ahead? Yeah, the gas station. Right. You know who works at the gas station? Mark Walters? Uh-huh. Creep. No, I don't want to see him. Come on. Let's just go have some Halloween fun with him. OK, five minutes though. Five minutes, that's it. Trick or treat Walters. Listen, do me a favor. Give me a dollar's worth of gas and uh, check under the hood. Clean the windshield for me all right? Hurry up about it. We got a party to go to all right? He gives me the creeps. Yeah. Think he's ever been with a girl before? Probably not. Come on. Let's show him what it would be like, huh? Anything else? Uh, yeah. Uh, put some air in the tires and give me another dollar's worth of gas will you? And listen, uh, do me a favor Mark? Take these with you OK? May I have the fire department please? Oh no, it's not an emergency. There's a car burning with a couple of people in it. Oh, it's the old gas station off Highway 58. Walters, Mark Walters. And by the way, happy Halloween. [MANIACALLY LAUGHING] Happy Halloween Mr. White. Thank you. Excuse me. Don't do that mark. What's wrong with you? Don't go sneaking up behind people like that. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. What can I do for you? You like ice cream? What? I want to buy you an ice cream. No. I don't like ice cream. Look, I'm closing up the store. Do you want that? Yeah. $0.25. Good night. Hi Sheri. It's me. Yeah, I'm just going to make the deposit and then I'll be over. Mhm. You will not believe who came in today. Mark. He's such an idiot. Wanted me to have ice cream with him. No, I'm not going to go. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm just going to make the bank deposit and then I'll be over. Mhm, Yeah. How'd you get in here? I want to take you to the movies. I don't like the movies. Stay back Mark. I'll kill you I swear. I just want to take you to the movies. I don't want to go to the movies. Stay back. I just want to go to the movies. No. No! He's crazy. Excuse me, your honor, but he's a fucking nut case. The girl's family doesn't want any part of it. John, don't do this to me. That son of a bitch doesn't have any right walking the street and you know it. I did all I could. Come on, we've all seen this 100 times. The family is scared. They testify then what? He's convicted and then sentenced. It's an open and shut case. Open and shut case my ass. It's shut for three months while he's in jail. Then he comes out and he opens it again. The girl is shaking. Believe me your honor, if this were your daughter you'd do exactly the same thing. That's the way our system works. Counselor, you don't have to tell me how our system works. Bill, do you have anything to say? Well, according to the test results he appears to be as strange as it may seem, normal. Normal? Anyone who terrorizes a girl simply for refusing to go to a movie with him isn't normal. You don't need your ink blots to figure that out doctor. Easy counselor. What difference does it make? The family's not going to press any charges. I don't see any point in keeping this discussion up. I have an appointment in a half hour. I think we should just wrap it all up. These are my chambers. And I decide when things are wrapped up. I'm sorry your honor. With that attitude, I can imagine how hard you tried to persuade the family to press charges. Your other client will wait. Your honor, the boy has an unusual history which dates back to his childhood. I wouldn't want him coaching my son's baseball team. But he has no place in jail or a mental institution at this time. So let's give him time to mutilate a half dozen women for refusing to go out with him. Now that'll be enough counselor. Save your grandstand remarks for the juries. I'm not impressed. I could prescribe some medications that would control his erratic behavior. Since the death of his parents I see here that he is in the custody of his grandmother. His grandmother's a wealthy lady. A defense attorney could've made a bundle off her if the girl would have testified. The grandmother has expressed a great desire to keep the custody of the boy. And I feel that necessary for the court to also to request that she provide for the boy's care, both with a live-in nurse and psychiatrist to monitor his behavior and growth and administer the series of medications that will be prescribed. Now, If the grandmother is as rich as you say she'll have no problem affording it. Your honor I'm sorry for my behavior this afternoon. But I sure hope you know what you're doing. So do I. So do I. [HUMMING] Mark? Hello grandmother. How are you this evening? Very well, and you? Very well, thank you. I see you've taken your medication. Oh yes. There'll be no more going without that. I've learned my lesson. I um-- I was thinking-- Yes grandmother? I was-- well, it's such a nice night. I thought you might like to sit with me while I work on my new rug. Yes. I'd like that very much. That would make me very happy. Do you feel up to it? Yes grandmother. Are you absolutely sure of that honey? I'm positive. I feel very sure of myself now. The medicine and the doctors, they were the right thing. Very well then. Thank you grandmother. I love you. And I promise I won't be a disappointment. I know you won't sweetheart. You never have been. You-- you've just been, well, a little lost. I know. Come. I want you to give me your opinion on my latest work of art. All right. I'm only half done with it and it's taken weeks. Here, you see for yourself. Well? It's beautiful. You honestly think so or are you just being a sweetheart? No, I think it's your best ever. Oh, you are such a sweetheart. Here, sit with me and let's just be together. It's so lonely in this house. I-- well, it just feels wonderful having you with me. I think it's time we started having some company too honey. Would you like that? MARK: Yes, very much. Good. Because I think it's finally time. You've been so good. Next week is Halloween. What would you think about having a few people over? Or is that too soon? I wouldn't want to rush things. It's just that, well, we need people. We need company. Don't you think so? MARK: Yes, yes we do. Well, good then. We'll do It. We'll just do it. MARK: Good. Well, how many then? Um, would you feel comfortable with a group or just a few friends, the ones who understand? How about just the Marshals and Kip and Marcy? That would be nice, wouldn't it sweetheart? What dear? Wouldn't that be-- Mark? Just a few Halloween nut cakes? Mark? Maybe we'd better-- Just a few people. Just a few of us frigging nuts. Is that all you old bitches want? Happy Halloween you filthy old hag. Why do they call it The Hangar anyway? Because it used to be an airplane hangar, dumby. Are they really going to have four bands? Five. One out back. And they're all as awesome as hell. Halloween heaven. Woo woo! Will you keep your hands off you geek? Christ, will someone please fix this woman up with a beer? Five more miles man. Lots of good it'll do you. Now, I ask you my friends, is that true love or what? Uh-oh, what's this up ahead? Already? Already? God Kim, it's been two hours. Is it? Could it really be? Yeah. And there's Route 47. Go left. Well ladies and gentlemen, how does it feel to be alcohol legal? Woo hoo! How much longer now Billy? It's about 40 minutes, right down Route 47. What's that up there? Looks like a market or something. It's a grill. Hey, how about we stop for a submarine sandwich and some suds on the side? Actually I'm starved. And like Billy says, we're alcohol legal Ellen. I don't know, it's getting kind of dark and we still got about 30 miles to go. So what man? We have all night. So we stop for a short dinner break and we have a little beer while we're at it. Huh? Come on chicken shit, pull in. Don't call me chicken shit Billy. You can just walk your ass to The Hangar. Whoa big fella, relax. No harm intended man. Yeah, asshole. OK, OK, listen I mean it, I'm sorry man. Yeah, sure thing. No. No, I swear. I swear it, really. Come on. I'm dying of thirst Al. Let's get a beer. Ah, you know, I really think I could live on submarine sandwiches. And beer. Ah yes, the proverbial suds. [BELCHES LOUDLY] You pig. Oh, swigs bucket. Mister class, as always. Hey you guys, it's getting really dark out there. Come on, we got to get our butts in gear. It's time for Halloween at The Hangar. Thanks a lot Al. We all enjoyed the beer and sandwiches and stuff. Right girls? No way dude, come on. Cough up, uh, 12 bucks. Hey look guys, a costume shop. Ah! Come on Alan, just the wig. It's so rad. Don't you think so Mandy? Ooh, it makes you look so wicked. Look, I'd love to but the thing's $9. Oh come on Alan. I'll pay you back. I promise. I'll get the money from my mom as soon as we get back. It'll be so rad at the party. The party is the problem. It costs $5 each to get into The Hangar. $5 each? You got it ace. And after this little sub and beer break you guys just had to have, I got about uh, a big $17 to my name. That's $10 for us to get into The Hangar and $7 for more beer. Christ help us if we need anymore gas. (WHINING) Alan. What the hell do you want from me? I'm not made out of bucks Kim. I had to borrow off this from my old man. Jesus Christ. Excuse me. Were you interested in that wig? -Yes. No. We can't afford it. I realize that. I've been listening. But there might be something we could work out. What's that? Did I hear you say you were on your way to The Hangar? Yeah that's right. Actually I have this delivery I need made out at Hollowgate. Hollowgate? Right. It's an estate about five miles off of highway 47. An estate? Rich people? Very rich. I think they're having a very large party tonight. They've ordered a dozen costumes. And my delivery boy, he didn't come in. So what do you have in mind? Well, it's a big order and uh, I hate to lose the business. I can't close up shop. Well, I guess I was thinking that maybe if you could make the delivery for me, that maybe we could uh, throw in the wig for payment? Is this place, like, far off the highway or something? Oh, no no. There's this huge iron gate. Holy shit. That guy wasn't kidding when he said estate. Where the hell is the house? You got me. Oh wait, I think I see it. Up there, behind those trees, up the hill to the right. Totally outrageous. Oh look Alan, there's an intercom. Hello. Hello? MARK: Can I help you? Uh hi, yeah, we're from the costume shop. MARK: The what? The costume shop. Oh oh, oh, the party. Did you bring the costumes? Yeah. MARK: Oh, super. Did you say we? Yeah, uh, me and my friends. See we're on our way down to The Hangar. We're not from around here. We're just doing this guy down at the costume shop a favor. MARK: Well great. Come on in. Awesome. Look, I'll go. Could we go too Alan? You think I'm going to carry all those frigging boxes myself? -All right. -Dynamite. You too man. I'll wait here. Hey, I got all those humongous boxes in the back. Now show a little class. Christ. OK guys, dig in. Wait up for me. Let's do it. Can you believe this place? Yeah, the guy on the intercom sounded kind of cute too. I have a great idea man. Why don't we just leave them here? I'm sure there's plenty of Halloween honeys available at The Hangar. Hey, that's fine with me, right Mandy? I mean, something tells me this wealthy gentlemen wouldn't mind um, entertaining two stranded young women on Halloween night? You guys are just a bundle of laughs. Come on, what's the hold up? Ring it again Al. Well, hello there. Hi, uh, we have the costumes. Come right in. Well, I'm glad you could all make it. Put them right over here. Well, I wish there was something I could do to thank you all. Perhaps a quick tour. -Yeah. -Oh no. Kim, it's already late. We have to go. Oh come on Alan. It's such a beautiful house. Please? It's really not as big as it looks. And it wouldn't take long. Why not? What's up there? Oh, that's private. I hope you don't mind. Hey, no problem. No problem man. Well, that's about it. What do you think? It's really cool. It's really awesome. Just so lucky. Yes, I am very lucky. I'm feeling very good these days. And it would be a shame not to share those good feelings. In fact, there's one more thing I'd like to show you. I hope you don't mind. MARK: Oh Kim! Yes? MARK: Could you help me here for a moment my dear? Sure. [SCREAM] It's Halloween boys and girls. Just a bunch of us old nut cakes huh? So what do you say we have us a little party? Get in! I've got the costumes. I've got the keys. He's got my keys run! Run! Oh my god! You OK Billy man? You all right? Yeah, I'm OK. What the-- It's electrified man, the whole fucking gate's like a goddamn high-voltage power line. Oh my god, We're trapped! We're in deep shit man. That guy's a real killer Al. Oh my god. Did you see that old woman? MARK (ON INTERCOM): Listen up good buddies. Come on up and we'll all take a costume OK? Five minutes. You've got five stinking minutes and then I'm going to get offended. Then I'll put on the costumes. And I'll do all the trick or treating. Oh my God. He's coming out here. Oh no Alan please! Come on. We got to hide. Fast. -What way are we going Al? -This way. Come on. What are we going to do? Oh God, he's coming! You guys he's coming. -Kim! Kim! Listen to me Kim, he's not coming. Calm down. He's right. He's right we got to calm down. The whole place can't be surrounded by an electrical fence. There has to be some other way out of here. There's got to be another gate or something, somewhere. Right. Let's think about this. Come on hurry! I say we walk the perimeter. This place is huge! Well what do you want to do? Just sit around here and wait for him? -No! -Oh my God no! OK, OK, OK, which way? Which way? Let's keep going this way. The fence must be around here somewhere. Wait, wait. What's that? It's a frigging car! Back to the gate! Hey! Hey! Wait! Stop! So when do I get the scoop on that old recluse in there? Oh that's right, you haven't heard about old granny Nelson Marky boy yet have you? Just that uh, she's a recluse and he's a head case. Head case? That's putting it lightly. Good bet the kid's a goddamn murderer. Murderer? At least I think he did it. Did what? Eh, it was about three years ago. A couple of little kids. One day they both just up and disappeared, two of them. Well, after a week we found them. Bottom of a dry well near Cherry Hill. All cut up in little pieces. Holy shit. Yeah, they couldn't prove the kid did it and they never found out who did. Well, it had to be him. He's nuttier than a fruitcake and everybody around here knows it. He's got a history of violence, shock treatments, all kinds of shit like that. So he's loose? A little while after that they caught the son of a bitch decapitating a dog. What the-- Right, are you ready for that one? Got Bill Weston's little sheltie, cute little dog, all sliced up. Stacks the pieces, you know, legs and all that, nice little pile and he's singing goddamn prayers to them. Oh Jesus Christ. Well after that they put the little bastard in the state hospital. So what's he doing here? Good old granny Nelson. She owns about half the county and probably about half the people in it too. Well anyway, she decides that the kid should be at hone. You know, hospital isn't good enough for him. So she goes and builds a little mini hospital right in there. Staffs it with doctors and nurses and all that. and then she gets the state to approve it as a bonafide annex to the main mental facility. You've got to be kidding! No, that was about two years ago. Get this. About two weeks ago word comes down the kid's just as good as new. Staff of doctors and nurses, they get released. No longer needed. The old woman's doing? That's my guess. So now it's just the two of them. Yep, just him and her. Till that kid goes bug shit again, my guess is. And maybe knocks off old granny herself. And I wouldn't put him past it. I mean it. That kid is dangerous Mitch, real dangerous. Hey listen, um, you hungry yet? Yeah, I guess. You like meatball sandwiches? Sounds good. Good because right up ahead's a place that I know of that makes the best goddamn meatball sandwiches in the whole state. Damn! He didn't even see us. He didn't even see us. Cut it out OK? Jesus, we're going to get out of here. No we won't. Yes we will! Yes we will Kim. We will. Now Billy's right. OK. OK. OK. It's OK. Just try and put everything that we saw out of your head. OK? Just concentrate on how we can get out here. OK. OK. I'm OK now I promise. OK. You think we should stay here and hope for another car? I don't remember seeing a car since we left the sub shop. Even if we did they probably wouldn't see us. Unless we could signal somehow. With what? I don't know. As long as we keep moving he won't know where the hell we are. We stay in the buses and we keep quiet we have the advantage. Agreed? Me too. OK. OK. Listen to me. I'll take the lead. You follow in the rear Alan. Ready? War is hell. War is hell. The gooks are out. The gooks are out. I'm coming to get you. What do you think? I don't know. it looks like a gardener shed or a garage or something. Hey look, there's a road over there too. That means something has to be coming in and out of here. What do you think? No. What do you think? We got to check it out. If there's a car there or something we can use to get through the fence. Yeah maybe shovels or something. We could dig under. It sounds reasonable. Hey man, one of us has got to go. Yeah. You want to flip for it? Maybe we should all go. No. I'll go. I know. I know. We'll both go. I mean, there's no way he can mess with both of us, right? No. No. I won't be left alone. No way. I'm going. That's it. Al, you stay here and take care of the ladies. Are you sure man? Sure. OK. I'm going. -No. No. Don't. Don't go. Listen, Al's here. We got to figure a way to get out of this place. Billy don't leave me please. I've got to go babe. Be back in a flash. Stay down. I'll be back in a second. Damn. Happy Halloween gook. He's OK. He's OK. What the? Al? Al buddy. Oh my God. Al! Oh, you want the gook here? He's yours. But let me finish him off for you. No! I think you better leave the fucker to me sarge. Cause I'm going to feed his ass to the jaguars. Move out Sargent. There's gooks out tonight. I said move out Sargent. See you later sarge. So anyway, the hooker says a gorilla? Well, no wonder he kept throwing him banana peels all night. Oh, look out boys, it's the law. Back in arms and half starved. How you doing Dan? Pretty good Andy. I've had worse Halloweens. Listen, I want you to meet my new partner. This here is Mitch Alstead. Oh no, you lost another one on a shootout? How you doing Mitch? Glad to meet you Andy. Have a seat boys. You name it we got it. Looks like whatever you got ain't pulling in too many people tonight. Yeah, it's been pretty slow. I figured you'd be all filled up with them weekend state-line warriors. Had quite a few in earlier but they're all headed out to that jam joint out there on the highway. The hangar? Guess they got some kind of a Halloween bash going on out there. Hey, maybe I should hang a body or two around here huh? Yeah, we was just out there. Man Andy, they was a rocking and a' rolling. I'll tell you, some of them are going to be rolling their asses all the way into jail. Well, the way they come through here, looks like they was headed there too. Sucking down them beers and burning off down 47. Yeah, we're definitely going to have our hands full tonight. So while we got a little time, how about you fix me up with one of them meatball sandwiches of yours? My moldy meatballs with the blood red sauce huh? You Mitch? Make it two. You got them. Say Dan, did you hear the one about that Indian chief who couldn't fart so he sends his medicine man down to the town to get some beans, right? Alan. I loved him. Oh God I loved him. I did. I really did. Sometimes I got smart with him but I loved him. He really knew how I felt. He did. I don't know how he could do it. But it was like he could see what I was thinking. He-- he just told me the night we were going to do it. He did Alan, I swear. He said we would and we did. Last night. Last night was the first time. Oh God, I loved him. Did you see him? Did you see him? He just-- he just-- Oh my God. You got to hang on Mandy. We got to hang on. We all got to hang on, OK? Jesus Christ, I can't believe this is happening. Kim, Kim, talk to me. Kim! We got to go you guys. We got to go. We got-- listen to me. Listen to me. OK? Listen. I'm going to take the front. OK? Now you signal and you tap me if you have to talk OK? Alan? No, come on. Are we going to make it? Yes, we're going to make it. You got to trust me. But we got to go now. OK? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. MARK: You don't come walking onto my spread. Come to get my woman boy? I'm coming to get you. Oh, it's just a big open space. Should we cross it? We've got to. OK, OK, listen Mandy. I'm going to go first. And then you send Kim. And then you come yourself. Oh Alan, I'm scared. Believe me, so am I. But we have got to get across. OK Kim, did you hear what I said? OK. Now when Mandy sends you, you have to come across to me. Come across fast. OK? OK, now you see that little clump of trees over there? I'm going straight into it. OK, do I send Kim right after you? No! Don't send her and don't come yourself until you get my signal. I'll wave. All right? And in the meantime, don't move a muscle or say a word. But Alan! Listen to me. If you don't get my signal after a few seconds after I get there just-- just turn around and run the other way without me. OK? Alan, I can't just-- You have got to. You have got to get away. Do you understand? OK, Kim, Kim, I really love you. I meant everything I said the other night, OK? God. Oh Alan. Come on Alan. Come on. Come on Alan. Oh no Alan, don't leave us. Please don't leave us. Alan. Alan. Oh thank God. OK. Go, hurry. Hurry. Hurry so I can go. Kim, Kim! Kim! I love you too. Go hurry. Hurry! Hurry! God. Oh thank God. Thank God. No! Come on. Come on. Come on. Jesus Christ. Come on. Jesus Christ come on! Mandy run! Come on. Come on. Come on. Jesus Christ. Mandy! Oh God! Oh Mandy! Alan! Help me! Hold up there cowboy. Some kind of rustler, hey boy? No. Just-- Think you can come in here and steal my woman? Rustle my cows? Steal my goddamn prisoners huh boy? Listen, we just want to leave. Honest to God, I swear we won't tell anybody. You think you can stop all the killing? Just by saying nothing? Do you boy? Huh? No, I just want to leave. I know what you want. I know what you want from me boy. MANDY: Alan! Help me! God help me! Bastard! Aw, come on outlaw. What's a little Halloween pretend, huh? Oh, just us old nut cakes. Just me and the old nut cakes. So that's when I decided that the big city just wasn't my piece of cake. What happened to her? Still there I guess. All I know is I got out. Well, sounds to me if she ever catches up with you she's going to put your lights out. Oh shit. So what about you Dan? Oh, hell, I've been here going on 10 years now. Damn near a native, huh? Yep. Came in after a 10 years stint in the army. In the army? Yeah. I was an MP for six of those years. No shit. Just never could seem to get anywhere with it though you know? Except maybe into trouble. So one day I just cashed it all in. Where'd you get out at? Fort Polk, Louisiana. Bought me an old Pontiac, headed home for Eureka. Passed through here along the way and kind of liked what I saw. Liked people too. Hell, I wasn't in no hurry so I stuck around a few days and well, next thing you know I hear about this job. and rest is history. Ah, the men in blue. Oh hi Mel. How you doing old buddy? MARK: I say, tally ho. Ah, the fox is about. And I'm coming on the hunt. Jolly good fun, what. We are going to get out. Do you hear me? We are getting out and we are going now. Do you hear me? We are gone from this goddamn place! [INAUDIBLE] Come on! Come on! Now listen to me. There is this golf cart and it is going to get us out of this place. Do you hear me? Goddammit, will you quit-- will you quite this shit and talk? Will you just talk to me? Fucking talk to me! God you can't do this! You want to stay here alone? Do you? No. No. Please. God, I loved them so much. God I love you Kim. Christ. Christ. i love you. I tried Kim. I fucking tried. I did. I know. I know. OK, oh god, I can't-- I can't believe-- I can't believe they're-- they're fucking gone! I-- they're-- What the fuck? What the fuck are we going to do? What? God I love you. OK, we got to go. Come on. We got to get that cart. OK? OK, we're out of here. OK come on. Come on. Come on. Sit. I say chaps, are we ready for the hunt eh? Oh, I've just realized something. The chaps haven't been fed recently have you, not since dear old grandmama passed away. Dead you know. Well chaps, what do you say ah? After the hunt. Oh my dear. You look simply drawn. We must get you to the hospital. What does the little shit do? huh? He calls in sick on the busiest day of the year. Sounds like the kid is in need of a little personal counseling to me. Swift kick in the rear I'd say. Oh, none of that nicey nicey stuff for me. I'm going to fire him first thing Monday. What if he really was sick? Right, coincidentally on Halloween night? Sure thing. Do you realize I had to have strangers making deliveries for me? Deliveries? Christ, you must have been doing some business. Who the hell got a delivery? Sent a dozen full costumes. Now you realize not masks and capes and stuff like that, but full costumes. Out at Hollowgate, Didn't look like a party out there to me? Of course, yeah, we would see the house from the road. We was out at Hollowgate about an hour ago. It's pitch black out there as usual. About what time did you send out those costumes? About uh, 7:30, I sent them out with some kids on their way to The Hangar. Kids huh? State liners? Yeah, 18, 19 years old. Two boys and uh, two girls. Well, I had to get them out there somehow. I can't believe that old woman is having a party. Jeez. From what you tell me about that lady and that kid, I'm with you. I don't think it the old granny that was having the party. Why? Well it wasn't her that called. It wasn't? No. The boy? Yeah. Well, he's OK now ain't he? Hey Andy, you mind if I use your phone buddy? Sure thing Dan. I don't know, it just didn't sound right Mitch. It may be nothing but it ain't going to hurt to call. Yeah, here we go, right here. MARK: That's all right. Just relax now. I just have a few final adjustments to make. Good. Now, lie back and relax. That's a girl. Good. [PHONE RINGS] I'd better got get that. It's going to be all right. It;s going to be just fine. MITCH: What do you think? I don't know. I just don't like it. That kid's just too damn loony. Shall we go have a look? Let's go. Hey, I-- I heard the kid was OK now. Do I frighten you my dear? I don't mean to. Although I must admit. This room once frightened me very much also. But it made a difference. It helped. For a while. It's the medicine, you see, that makes the difference. Oh, it hurts a bit but well, that's the point. You see, it takes those parts of the brain, those sore parts, those parts that don't work just quite right and makes them better. Well, I know you see what I mean. It's going to be just fine. We're going to go in and take out all those bad feelings and you're going to feel just great. So that one big gate's the only way in that place? Yeah, that fence is carrying high voltage. Security precaution for the kid. So how do we get in? Well, first we try the intercom and hope to hell nothing's wrong. We got to get there first. How long? About five minutes. The procedure is actually quite simple. First you take your medicine. That puts you to sleep. Then once you're sedated, we go in and take out all the bad parts. Simple. Now, it's time to drink up like a good girl. Still a little frightened? Well here, let me help you. Now, open wide. Let me try this intercom. Hello? This is the police. Hello? Open up. This is the police. Is Mrs. Nelson in? Please open up. It's locked my dear. No one goes in. And no one goes out. So why don't we play doctor? You know what doctor says is best. Didn't your mother ever tell you that? You hear that? Was that a window? I think so. Bitch. [KIM SCREAMS] Mitch! No! Jesus! Mitch, you all right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, some party. It's that kid. I knew it was. You'll have to come out now. There's no way out, you filthy little pig. Mitch, try the door. Locked. Hello! Hello this is the police. Open up. Open the door! [KIM SCREAMS] Now come my dear. What's a little slicing of this? Or that? Please! Boy! Time for your medication Kim. What's a few drugs? What's a little surgery? Come on in. She's still pretty well out of it. Poor kid. Rick, you take her right side.
