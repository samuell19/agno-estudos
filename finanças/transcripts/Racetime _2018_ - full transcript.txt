The sled's almost perfect. You take this stuff way too seriously. You don't have to beat the new kid. He challenged me. What else can I do? - Come on. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a few more minutes. Okay. See ya in the morning, genius. Zac does not know what he's up against. Finished. And four-eyes is finished too. Hm? Hm. - Whoa! - Behave. Eww. Argh, guys! Frankie, go to sleep. I need to measure something. The gap between the sled runner and the steering column can't be greater than the thickness of a feather. Great. That's what I thought. I think I'm actually going to break my own speed record tomorrow. Break a sleep record. Great. Me too. Huh? - What? - Ah! What did you eat? It's race day, folks! Time to roll! - Go! Go! Go! - Hurry up, guys! Let's go show that new kid who's boss. Yeah! Hey, Frankie, remember, this is supposed to be fun, right? You know what is fun? Winning, like we always do. Oh, yeah. Whoo! I can't wait. I love sleeping here the night before. I wasn't dreaming. Come here, little guy. Come here. Oh, you are so cute. Do you like sleepovers too? Stop. The barn's for everyone. Even puppies. Where'd you come from? Puppies aren't supposed to wander around in the cold. It's race day! That's right. The Sixth Annual Slederator race! Yeah! And let's go right to the first race. - There's no room for you. - I was here first. - I'm the driver. - No, I'm the driver. And they're off! To a very slow start. Whoa! Steer, Manolo! Steer! How do you steer a box? Look at me go! Woo-hoo-hoo! - Whoa! - Woohoo! - Yes! - And we have a tie! - Photo finish! - Did you get a picture? I'm Daniel Blanshire from Victoriaville. I got lots of pictures So? Who won? Um, sorry. I... I seem to have missed that one. You what? Whoa! Here, hold him for me. I'll be right back. Oh, he's so cute. Where did he come from? Okay! Is this a puppy party or a race? Ready! Blow the bugle! Do it! And they're off on this exciting second race. Piers is having some trouble controlling his sled tire. Whoa! Lucy! I'm gonna get you! Ooh! Aah! Hey, come back here! Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Oh, yeah! Woohoo! Rats! And a victory for Lucy! I planned the whole thing! I'm okay. I've got Chuck making some last-minute improvements to the sled, and with you driving, we're gonna make history. Oh, this is gonna be good. Frankie, with your sleds, you're making history every year. Okay, okay, coming through. Ugh, make way. Hmm. Ugh. Amateur-ville. Is that him? I don't like him. No sweat. He's obviously all show. Hmm. Oh, did I do that? So sorry. Here, have a candy cane. Never take candy from a stranger. Well, where's my ratchet? - One ratchet coming up. - You... Ah. Hi, I'm Charlie, Zac's cousin. I'm driving his sled. - What's your name? - Who? Me? Uh, um, Chu... Chu... Chu... Chu... Chu... You're called Chacha? No, no, no. Chuck. Name's Chuck. Not the legendary Chuck? They say you're the strongest guy in the village. Uh, um, yeah. - Hm. - Hey, do you work out? Well, I... I don't really need to. I just, uh, lift things a lot. Okay, you're funny. You're funny. I have to go now to get ready for the race. Good luck. And the main event is coming up! Frankie going for his sixth win against newcomer Zac. For those of you who don't know, Sophie is driving for Frankie and Zac's cousin, Charlie, is driving for him. Thank you, thank you! Whoa, mama! That is some sled! It's so shiny! Candy cane? No, thanks. I never eat before a race. You seem pretty confident for a guy who hasn't won the Slederator five years in a row. You seem pretty confident for a guy who's about to start his losing streak. Alright then, okay. I see what you're doing. Hey, I'm Sophie. You must be Charlie. - I hear you're a good driver. - Oh, that's so nice. I heard the same about you. In three, two, one! And they're off! ♪ Pump it up get that heart beating ♪ ♪ I'm energized I feel the power within ♪ ♪ I like the rush the wind against my face ♪ ♪ Whatever I do I'm gonna keep the pace ♪ - Hey, are you crazy? - Oops, sorry! ♪ Whatever I do I just wanna feel ♪ Oh, yeah! Be careful, guys! ♪ Alive ♪ Whoa. Whoa! Oops, Sorry. Alright! Whoo! Yeah, she's gonna win! She's gonna win, she's gonna win! Woohoo! ♪ Alive ♪♪ It's the final jump! - Better luck next time. - The race ain't over yet. Let's finish this. Hey! What's wrong with this thing? Oh-oh. Sophie! Like you said, better luck next time. Sophie, are you alright? I'm okay. Nothing's broken. Sophie! Are you sure? You have all your bones? Good puppy. What did you do to my sled? I'm okay, thanks for asking. What did you do to it? Nothing. Weren't you watching? It fell apart. There's no way my sled could just fall apart. Are you saying it was my fault? Guys, chill. I can't believe you would take the side of the sled over me! It's just... you know I take pride in my workmanship. I will never drive one of your crummy sleds again. Crummy sled? How dare you! Guys, come on. You're friends! - Were friends. - Well, ditto. - Goodbye. - Ugh! - Yeah! - Congratulations, Mr. Zac. Mm, thank you, yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - Mm, yes, thank you. - Three cheers for the winner! From the bottom of my heart, thank you all, you rustic villagers. By the way, I love rustic villagers. - Yay! - That was amazing, yeah! I will cherish this trophy because I earned it and really, really wanted it. And now, I got it! And as a special treat, I've got a victory show for you. - Oh. - My cousin, Charlie! Zac, I wasn't gonna sing. Come on, let's milk it. You're the one who always says you wanna be famous. Well, I guess I could. Here goes! ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪ ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪ ♪ What if we played it all or nothing ♪ ♪ Holding on to this moment in time ♪ ♪ Oh oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Ha-ha-ha-ah-ah-o-o-o ♪♪ That was just beautiful! Isn't she amazing, everyone? Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Woohoo! We love Charlie! We love Charlie! And Zac! Zac too! - We love Charlie! - Thank you! - Thank you, everyone! - We love Charlie! You know, if the puppy's owner doesn't show up I might have to keep him. It just doesn't make sense. My sled was designed to survive re-entry from low earth orbit! Stop feeling sorry for yourself. It's just a race. It's a nightmare. Somebody, pinch me. You'll wake up. I know you. Give me that. Put it down, puppy. We're going home. Later! Duh! It just doesn't make any sense. Hm. That's weird. The steering bolt is missing. What have we got here? Hmm. Mint. - Look! - Huh? Look what I found! Uh, what, what am I looking at here? Candy cane dust! Oh, candy cane dust. It was all over the wreckage. I suspect foul play. I think Zac cheated! Was there any moment when Zac could have slipped in and tampered with the steering? Uh, no, I was there and then Charlie came over. Well, while you were making goo-goo eyes at Charlie, that sneak Zac switched the steering bolt with this! The candy cane dust? - I don't know. - Oh! So how long are you staying at granny's? Who knows? Until whenever my parents remember I'm here, I guess. Hey, you! Cheater! Stop! Oh, it's you. I'm surprised you can hold your head up so high after such an embarrassing day. Uh, oh, you... No! I know all about this! Huh? About what? Someone ate your sandwich? What do you have to say when I say the words candy cane? Candy cane. Delicious treats. Great for hangin' on trees. Goodnight, loser. Don't you walk away from me! If you wanna accuse me of cheating, you'll need actual, visible proof! Relax, Frankie. Maybe he didn't cheat. Hey, you can't win every race. Yes, I can! You think... Come with me! - Lucy! - Aah! Don't you know better than to creep up on a kid hard at work? Sorry, but this is good. Real good. We have every reason to believe that Zac cheated. Yeah, and we're going on a top secret spy mission. I'm assembling a team of top-notch super agents to help uncover and prove the cold hard truth! - Where did she go? - Hey! Are you two just gonna stand there all day flapping your gums? Let's go! Something's come up. I can't finish firewood duty! Uh, where are you going? Can't say. Top secret! Sophie, we're gonna find proof that I'm right. Well, don't get into any of his sleds if you value your life! I won't. Bye! Careful, Chuck. It's fragile. Stress much. Wow! - What is that thing? - Shh, quiet. - Hey, guys! - Whoa! Sorry, I'm late. Mm-hmm. Don't use up all the hot water. He's in the shower. Time to investigate. How's the picture? Good, but a little to the left. That's it. Whatever you do, don't look up. - Or down. - Curse my genius arms. Oh. Whoa! You're looking down! Whoa, he's good, like a Ninja. Huh? I'm okay. Base camp, do you read me? - Loud and clear. - I'm going in. Ugh! Whoa, lots of awards. Do you think he's smarter than Frankie? Never! He probably stole them! Quiet. I'm investigating. Sorry, Frankie. Oh, that bird sounds close enough to touch. - Nope. - Huh? Okay, Frankie, if you were an evil fake genius where would you... Hm, hm. Where's that light coming from? Oh, owl. Hmm. Uh-oh. Wow. What? Now way! He's an evil genius? Be careful, Frankie. He might have evil brain superpowers like mind control or laser vision! - Let's not exaggerate. - I'm not! His brain might be superior to yours in every way! Lucy. There must be a cheat sheet here somewhere. Oh, he must have planned it, something, anything. Uh... A steering bolt! I knew it. Now I got ya! Some genius. Oops. Shh, quiet. Ho-ho-ho. Hey, a surprise visit? Or are you spying on me? Where did he come from? Oh, that was really unusual. Fran, Zac's on the move. Didn't you hear? But these birds. They're so interesting? Uh, you cheated! You're just saying that 'cause you lost. No. I'm saying it because you did. And I have proof. Investigated. I, we... well, I, uh, it's, um... - Oh, there it is. - That's it, Frankie. - You don't back down! - You the man, Frank! - Yeah. - You the man, Frank! Okay. You got me. You're right. - And I regret it. - You do? My sled's better, my driver's better, and I'm just plain better. Ask your friends. They were there. That guy's not gonna make many friends with that attitude. I don't think he wants friends, Chuck. I think he wants a bop on the nose. - Then I demand a rematch! - Great idea. Because cheaters have to be put in their place and... - Wait a minute, what? - Yeah, a rematch. Only this time on a real track. You're right. A racetrack that really tests our abilities. It will have banked curves. - A high speed straightaway. - A big jump! And... and... and a way to take sleds back uphill so they can race downhill again! - Oh, this is getting good. - Are they friends now? Ooh, and then... then... then a loop! A fantastic loop unlike any loop that's come before! I can't wait to get started! Hand me my drafting pencil. Uh, no. Don't think so. You're a cheater and we don't need you. Huh? Fine. If it's war you want, it's war you'll get. No, no, no, no. We don't want war. Trust me, we want a race. A fair race. And while you're building a world-class track, I'll build a better sled. A super sled. Can you even repair your sled in time? Yeah, you bet I can. I have friends to help me. Mm-hmm. The door's right there. Please leave. No, thank you. I'll go out the way I came in. Whoa! Can you guys give me a hand, please? Hold on, Fran! We'll leave your teeth, I promise. Oh, well this should be easy. If your owner doesn't show up, you can stay here forever. A dog mansion. Whoa, lucky puppy. Lucky me. Yeah! Alright! - Yeah! - Woohoo! Come on, puppy! Guys, what's going on? We're gonna have another race! - Alright! - Alright! That's awesome! Woohoo! So, you see, it wasn't the sled or the driver. It was that Zac cheated. Still, Frankie was totally out of line. Yeah! - Whoa! - Hey, people! I'm trying to work, okay? Huh? Quiet! - We're quiet. - This is serious. I gotta work and you're distracting me. Go home and rest. We'll meet up again in the morning. - Okay, Frankie. - Okay, guys. Come on, puppy. - Try not to work yourself... - Hmph. Sophie. Oh, you're here. Yeah. Look, I'm really sorry I said you're a bad driver. You're not. I know you're not. And I'm sorry I said you had a crummy sled. This Zac character's a real cheater. - Look what he did to us. - I know. So what are we gonna do to him? We? As in you and me? Well, you need a driver, don't you? - You mean it? - Yeah. Let's crush this guy. Come here, little guy. Calm returns. My incomparable brain is tranquil and quiet. Too quiet.

You know, the train doesn't come through today. Yeah, I heard. Thanks, bugle boy. It was my dad's. It's all I have left. I understand what it's like to be lonely. I'm not lonely. I'm alone. There's a difference. I can't look. - Did anybody take a number yet? - Oh. Relax. Not a one. - Whoa, dog. - Good puppy. Why don't you just give him a real name? Do you need a name, puppy? No. He's not my dog. Somebody lost him, somebody who gave him a name and really misses him. Hey, stop that! I amaze even myself. I feel so good! Ooh. Wow. This, this is amazing. So cool. Hm. Watch it! There's a family of voles living in that hay! Voles? Wouldn't wanna disturb them. You can wait for Frankie if you want. The barn's for everyone. Okay. I'll leave you to your voles.

But I have got my eyes on you two. Wait till you see this. - That's it. - Hmm? Aww. You wanna play fetch. Go get it, boy! The Loop! I'm a genius. It's... it's way bigger than I imagined. I know. Too bad you had to use all that recycled junk though. Real genius finds solutions outside the box. You should try that. Oh. Oh, hey, Chuck. Hi, Charlie. So pretty busy? Nah. Just finished. - Y... you? - Oh, busy, busy, busy. You know, there's this race coming up. Yeah, I heard. 'Cause your cousin, he cheated. - Yeah, about that... - That's okay. I told everyone you had nothing to do with it. - Because you're really nice. - Huh? There you are. Have you been a good little puppy? Have you? Uh, maybe not so good. Great loop. Did you build it? Yeah. Me and my buddies. Real solid too. Oh-oh. What? - Come on! - Aah! What did you do? Me? I didn't do anything. I just got here. Well, then I guess you're cursed. You know what? Forget it. - I don't even want a rematch. - W... what? No way! I have to win! Well... I suppose we could make the race more interesting. - What do you mean? - Make it worth something. - Like what? - The barn. Whoever wins gets the barn. Ha! Forget about it. It's not mine to give. It's... everyone's. Well, I guess that's that then. Go tell everyone you're a loser. Wait, hold it! Hold it! Uh, okay. For the barn. It won't matter, anyway, because I'm not going to lose. Shake on it? I was thinking of something a little more official. So I wrote a contract in everyone's names. You can sign for them, right? Uh, yeah, sure. Thank you. - What happened? - I don't know. - Oh, no, not the loop! - Is everyone okay? Oh, did anyone get crushed? I think I'm kind of to blame for this. Ah, there you are, dog. I thought you were lost. Wait, that's Piers' dog. No, it's mine. My parents gave it to me, but it keeps running away. What? Oh. So that's nine times... - Hey, Frankie. - Piers. Equals... What you doin'? Everything. Double up the pegs for the guy-wires and increase the tension 10%. Oh. My new loop is designed to withstand an asteroid crash. Unless it's holding a chainsaw. Hey, you and Zac seem to be on pretty good speaking terms now. Mm-hm, hm, you're right. Ah, no, we're enemies. I'm gonna need a bigger hammer. Chuck, get Lucy a sledge hammer. So maybe you could talk to him. Oh! I mean, you saw. Puppy doesn't really wanna be with him. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. - Frankie! - Argh, Piers. I'm a little busy right now. Maybe after the race. This is important to me. Friends are supposed to stick by their friends. And I will. I will. After the race. Zac? Zac? - Are you here? - Huh? Zac? Are you in there? I need to talk to you. You guys spying on me again? Me? You're kidding? I'm dead serious. - Get out of here. - No. I came to tell you that it's not hard to make your dog happy. You know, so he doesn't keep running away. Sure, you did, spy. - Now I'm busy. - Great. If you're busy, let me walk your dog. I could train him. Ah, goodbye. Hm. By the way, Frankie has a bigger sled than yours. Way bigger. Hmph. It's a good idea. Why don't you just let him train the dog? A good idea is for someone, meaning you, to find out about their sled. Now! Frankie, you're gonna need a bigger sled! - Way bigger! - Huh. And I'm not even jokin'. Hey, Chuck. Uh, ho-ho! You know, Charlie, you sing like an angel. Oh, don't say that. So what you working on? Ho, ho, oh, it's our new sled. It's real fast. - Those the plans? - Yeah. I thought I'd get some souvenir pictures of you at work. Really? Okay. Great. Okay, I'm ready. Wait! H... how's that? Oh, hey, this... Oh, here. I'll pick this up. Thanks. I guess. No. Thank you. Well, see ya later, Chuck. No. See you later. Oh, and I'll autograph those pictures for you if you want. These are useless! You're not much of a photographer. I never said I was. Hey, drop it! Oh, gross. Dog drool. I think you should let that Piers guy play with the puppy a bit. Hmph. I think that's... Ah, get off that! Yeah... Torsion arm dampers, huh? Well, one picture helps. - Good work. - That's too bad. I thought you said you wanted to win fair and square. Actually, I just wanna win. Ugh, yuck! Stop licking! Disgusting. Ugh. I'll make a few more modifications tonight... Uh-oh. What? Oh, puppy? What are you doing here? Hey, the puppy definitely needs training. I thought maybe you could help us out. Seriously? I would love to. No problem. Hey. Thanks, Charlie. Get the ball! Go get it. Good puppy. Good boy. You wanna do it again? You wanna do it again? Good boy. Good boy. Just... ju... just give me two minutes. Okay. Tighten this screw. All torsion dampers are good. - Uh, speedometer... - Come on, Frankie. Stop fussing. Let's put this baby to the test.

How hard can it be to squeeze a little info out of that doofus? Hey, enough. What do you think this is? And who do you think I am? We're so close to winning this thing, and you're just gonna let me lose to that four-eyed maniac? I'm done with racing. I'm gonna concentrate on my music. Then maybe I can help your career. How? By spying on the competition? You're gonna need a recording studio, right? Well, I'll design and build one for you. Sure. Where are you gonna put it? The bathroom or in here? We'll build your studio in the barn. There's plenty of space for both of us. All you gotta do is help me win. Base to Sophie, the Loop is puppy-proof. Ready to launch. - Okay, okay, okay. - Wow. - So cool. - Here we go. Hey, get away from the sled. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Base camp, we have a problem! My sled! Mine! - That was fun! - Again! Ho, ho. Double touch down. No! Huh? Too bad the sled doesn't really have wings. - It could fly to the moon. - Is everyone okay? Ah, idea. Come on, time to go home. Race ya! Let's go! Whoa.

You're gonna join us and hang out in the barn? Oh, no. Four-eyes didn't tell you? When he loses the race, I win the barn. - And you guys are out! - What? ♪ Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi ♪♪ - You think it's safe? - Don't worry about it. Oh, don't worry. It's... it's perfectly safe. How could you? You have no right to give away the barn! The barn is everybody's! - Hey. - How did he do that? Uh, uh, I didn't want to. Zac made me. What are you talking about? What did Zac make you do? The race... Z... Zac, he... he... he wanted... Frankie bet the barn on the race! If he loses, we're out. - You did what? - Huh? What's wrong with you? I... I... I didn't have any choice. O... o... otherwise he wouldn't race. Uh, there'd be no rematch. So what? - This is our place! - Yeah. It's our barn, it's ours! - Yeah, exactly. - We all share it. "And the winner will therefore the possession of the barn." This contract checks out. It's got all our names on it and it's airtight. If I don't beat him, you guys will always wonder if I'm really the smartest. Is that what you really think of us? But I will win the race and then none of this will matter. You'll see. - Ugh. - Huh. No more pilot, no more friends. I guess that means no more race. You could just give up the barn now. Don't answer right away. Think about it. Yeah, that's it. Go get it, boy. - That's it. Come on back. - You cute little boy. - He's so cute. - Yeah, that's a good boy. Dogs make better friends than people. Thanks a lot. I didn't mean it that way. You know I'm talking about Frankie. - He's so fluffy! - Yeah. But how long can we stay mad at him? I don't know. Whoa. Hey, stop that! Aren't you the one who always says friends have to stick by each other? Ah, what are you doing? No! What are you doing? - I'm moving. - No! No, you're not! - Yes, I am! - No! No! No! I ruined everything. So you're giving up? That's not the Frankie Four-eyes I know. He'd never give up. Guess you never met the real me. The one who betrays his friends. Yeah, you sure disappointed us. You disappointed us a whole lot. But friends stick by each other, right? So let me know if I can help. Wait. You're still my friend? Yes, dummy. Huh? Huh? Huh? What are you doing here? So I thought about what you said, about quitting before anyone got hurt. And you realized I'm right and you're giving up. Au contraire. That's French, by the way. I propose we race each other. You against me? Driving? Yeah. One-on-one. If you're brave enough. Alright. I accept. But there is one condition. No rules. This time, anything goes. Agreed. Anyway, brains beat cheats every time. - Ugh. - No need to show me out. I know where the window is. Oh, bye, cutie wittle puppy. I'll see you tomorrow. Oh. Ah, I'm okay. - See, this is good. - Huh? We can win the race fair and square. Sure, but a little insurance policy wouldn't hurt. - You're such a cheater. - Don't play all innocent. It seems to me you helped. Your hands are as dirty as mine. What? Okay. We all know the deal. We've got an inexperienced driver racing against a kid that will do anything to win. And if we lose, we all move out of the barn. But we're not gonna let a couple of cheaters drive a wedge between us! We have to stick together to save the barn! Let's go! Oh, Charlie wouldn't cheat. Actually, Chuck, she was spying. She wouldn't do that. I know her. I overheard Zac thanking her for helping him cheat. No. I know her. She wouldn't do that. She wouldn't do that. Sorry. Don't worry. Brains beats cheating every time. Alright, yeah. Let's do this! Grrr. Slow poke. Hey! The starting gate is frozen shut. That didn't happen by accident. No problemo. Yeah! And he's off! You're five seconds behind. You can still catch him. This is Zac's first time driving, but he sure knows how to hold his position. Whoa! - Hot on his tail! - You're catching up, Frankie! Bleh! A little higher. Get closer. Steady, Frankie. Hairpin turn in three. Roger that. Two seconds and closing. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Huh? Argh! - Whoa! - Whoa! - Ow! Whoa! - Whoa. Whoa. Neck and neck. I'd say Zac has a quarter second lead. That's unofficial, of course. No fair. Zac is dumping rocks on the track. But Frankie was ready for it. Like he said, brains beat cheats every time. Huh? Who's the genius now? Did you plan for this, genius? No. Whoa! Whoa! Genius is as genius does! Sophie to Chuck. We need a number six swivel arm at turn nine. Do you cop... Frankie, Chuck's not responding. His walkie must be broken. It's not his walkie, it's his heart. Chuck? Whoa! Guys, I need a pole! A... a stick! Anything! Got it! If Frankie doesn't get that replacement part, this race is over. Chuck! Ha-ha! I'm okay. Okay. Huh? Whoa. Hey-hey! Do you honestly think Frankie has a chance? - He's way behind. - I have to hope so. Zac is solidly in the lead as he approaches the Loop. Good luck, four-eyes! Frankie, the Loop. Zac's done something. It's falling apart. You'll never make it! Can't stop now. Literally. The breaks are broken! Whoa! - Oh! - Huh! Huh? Huh? Airborne! Yes! Who knew a sled could fly? Huh? Huh? - Yeah! - No! Yeah! Oh! Ha! Huh? Hey, where is she? Charlie, you're supposed to roll me up the hill! Get over here or you can kiss your recording studio goodbye! Hey, squirts! Help me out and start cranking! Go, go, go! What? Where's Chuck? There's no trophy for second place, you know. Hello? Where's Chuck? I don't know. Lucy's looking for him. - What? - Charlie, you're ruining it. Where are you? Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! What are you doing? There's this race you've probably heard about. Okay. I don't feel like doing anything. Oh, come on, you big baby. It's my heart. Listen, I'm only gonna say this once. You have the biggest, strongest heart I know and Charlie doesn't deserve it. I think she does. If I ever fall in love... somebody kill me. There you are. Where have you been? Look! - Charlie!! - Charlie! Uh, you go girl! Wha... wh... what... what are you doing? Wh... what? - Huh! - Crank faster, small fries! Ah. Well, I don't know about this love story, but we could use the help. Don't just stand there, bunkhead! Alright! - Whoa! - He's gaining on me! Come on, Frank! Ah, traitor! - Bye-bye. - Ugh! Hurray! And now we say goodbye, loser! Whoo! Yeah. Not so fast! Whoa! I got it! - I'm okay. - I'm okay. Yes! Ah. - Did Frankie make it? - Who saw it? - Did he make it? - Who won? I did? Oh, right, I... I did! I... I won, right? Right? T... tell me I won, please. - Did I win? - Front page news! Frankie saves the barn literally by the skin of his teeth! He did it! Congratulations, Frankie! Three cheers for Frankie! Hip, hip, hooray! And the winner of the Sixth Annual Sledarator race... Frankie! Huh? Get away from me! That was fun. But let me tell you. Argue about who's smarter, go ahead. But never, and I mean, never ever ever... Ever! Choose winning a race over us. This. Sorry. But that really was fun. - He-heh! - Yeah! Team work! Watch the voles. What's a vole? Chuck, I'm sorry for cheating. Oh, it's okay. I mean, you finally saw the light, right? Sing! sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! Sing! - Go on. - We love Charlie! - We love Charlie! - Charlie!

You and me gotta figure out the best place in the barn for your workshop. I noticed you were a bit cramped at your grandma's. - Are you messing with me? - Huh? We're enemies! - Let's change that. - Huh? Let's be friends. Who'd wanna be friends with a cheater? Me, that's who. Hmm? We actually have a lot in common. Hey, remember when you said it, uh, wouldn't be hard to make my dog happy? Yeah, so the thing with dogs is, all they really need is love. And if you give him a little love, he'll love you right back. A little love. One more thing though, he really, really needs a name. I got one. Rumplebottom. Rexasaurus. - Ugh. - Ooh, Tiny. Guys, it's gotta be a real name. Like... Atchoo! Oh, I like it.
