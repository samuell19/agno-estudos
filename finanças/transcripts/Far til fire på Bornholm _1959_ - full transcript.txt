Then we stretch out our arms, stand with our legs out to the side, - - turns to the left and tilts, - - and from there straight across to the right and flip. Now. Then we have to have leg thrusts backwards alternately with the left and right leg. Come to a full stand. We have to walk around the floor. Four high up on toes, and four down in a deep knee bend. Now. Come on. We come down and sit on the floor. Then bow forward and roll backwards. Yes, and we will then end the walking tour on the spot. Now. - Thanks for today. - You're welcome. Whoa, what's that from, little daddy? Want to see come forward with you? - I have to have a small one on my eye. - You can believe no! Just until the coffee is finished. - It's done in a second. - I'm not going to the office today. Precisely for that reason. Now I'm going to give you your dressing gown. No, that's it... I won't wear it the other way around. Come on dad. No, no, no. Now let me sit for a moment. Nah, it won't work, little daddy. Mie, just go down. I go in and get dressed. - What are you doing here? - Not for nothing. Whoa, there's another one. when I left, my girl wanted to go with me my girl wanted to yes, my girl wanted to You can't, my friend, I'm going to war - Take another roll, little daddy. - It probably won't work. Aarh, huh. Your summer vacation has just begun. You should enjoy it. - The sunny holiday goes quickly anyway. - Too fast. What a shame you can't come to the country this year. A bit out to fishing, which you love so much. I feel so sorry for you. Thank you, my girl. Thank you. Don't you also feel a little sorry for yourself? Yeah, honestly. I feel bad for all of us. There should be no such thing as money. Nah, but they are now very rare to have. sorry for a little man like your father. You are no small man. You are a great man! A big, nice, fat man. - Good morning, good morning. - Good morning, Mrs. Sejersen. Can I pop in? There is something I want to talk about. - Yes go ahead. Just come. - Thanks. What do you think she wants? She was so decorated. Was she? Well, here she comes. Sorry, I'm so intruding. - Well, let's go and dump. - Yes please. Thank you. I know that I have to finish school today. I wanted to ask if I could come along. - It's so festive. - Yes, of course. I love to hear the children sing. I feel like I was a child again. It's just that afterwards... ... you should go to uncle Anders and drink chocolate, I know. - He called and invited me. - Yes, it can be funny. - Get a cup for Mrs Sejersen. - Thank you, thank you. I need a cup. It is for Mrs. Sejersen. She wants to go to the graduation. She has so few pleasures. Should it now be called a pleasure? - Ouch! - What is it? Peter. I had promised to ask if he could come along. 68-90. (the phone is ringing) Department L. Aah, good day. Just a moment, I'll call the doctor. - There is a telephone from home. - Thanks. Just put him on the bed. - Hey, love. - What have you? What? Sorry, it's just me on the phone. With my wife. Yes? Sorry, I called. Can you come home, or shall we meet at school? None of the parts. I can't leave here for hours. I come straight to uncle Anders. And Sis... No, I'd rather tell you when we meet. No, no. - No, it's rather something exciting. - Well, but then I'll be happy. Goodbye. Have you seen Per? We can't find him. Then look for him. Ih, my goodness, is it that many? - Dad? Good day, Mrs. Sejersen. - Good day, little Sis. - Have you seen Per? - Nah. He is nowhere to be found. Per! Per? - You must get dressed. - It will not be long. Don't think about me, though. I'm sitting very well, thank you. Per? Per? Per? He has disappeared without a trace. As long as nothing wrong has happened. It is just what it is. Here you can see for yourself. The pig crushed and emptied for every coin. - I wonder what he has come up with? - Have you found Per? Nah. He has fled with all his fortune, smart guy. Stop the stupid laugh. I'm not happy about it. We're leaving, and where is he? Take it easy. He must be somewhere. You should see a mess he made. Yes, then we just have to cuddle a bit in the stack. I mean, a little bit in the neck. Yes, sorry to backtrack. - Does the gentleman have time off from school? - No, we finish at 11. - Does the gentleman like going to school? - oh, yes! - What does the gentleman like best? - The breaks. It was good! Forward with the neck. Yes, then the gentleman is tipped and slapped! I mean, cut and washed. - Yes, shall we get a little hot in the sheep? - Grease in your hair? No, thank you, because that makes the pillow smell, says my older sister. And at home, we don't scratch any run cow. - We are not taking any risks there! - No! - You've learned it. - Yes! - Yes, go ahead. - Thanks. How much is it? Let's see. We don't charge anything for that, in return we charge an extra... 5.50. - That was expensive. - Well then you get it for 5.25. I only have five crowns. Then I'll take them, then I can owe you the rest. Yes, please. - Here you go, here is the gentleman's hat. - Thanks. How do you fare against the big boys? Work, easy. I have my little scams. - Little tricks? - I learned them from my older brother. Oh, and what is it? - Give me your hand. - Here you go. Ouch! - What was that, though? - Ordinary self-defense. Jiu-jitsu. It is something they have used in Japan for many hundreds of years. - Really? - And then there is this one. What is that? Oooucch! Stop it, kid! Ouch. And then I have another one that is really good. - Maybe it wasn't good? - Yes. Yes. Oh, it must be many o'clock. May I borrow your phone? Gladly. It's down there in the corner. (the phone is ringing) Yes, hello? Well, Per though. We are standing and going. - Where have you been? Where are you? - It must be a surprise. But just go ahead, and we'll meet at the school. So long. If only he is late. It's too wrong though! Where is he? - Can you pick up that banana peel? - Someone could come and slip in it. Let it go a little willingly. It is there. Aah, it was Miss Ludvigsen! Ouch! - A beautiful belly landing! - We have to help! - Good day, Miss Ludvigsen. - Aah, good day. - I think I fell. - At least they are lying down. Now I have to help you up. Now you will see, like this. It's too bad with those banana peels. The children will probably take their things. Then he'll be late anyway. - I'll probably have to wait for him. - No, it was just missing. - Hello. Hello. - Yes, we'd better go inside. Another school year has passed and the holidays are just around the corner. Now I must go out into the forest and field and beach and gather new strength, - - so you can return to school healthy and happy - - and with new courage to take action. The work you put in here at school is important for your entire future. Good school skills are necessary to be able to cope in life. And society demands that everyone must learn something. Do your best so that everyone can find their place. (the children laugh) You too, Little Per. There you go... there you go. Have you seen him, father? He's had his curls cut off. I think it suits him. He looks much more manly. And then we will hear the holiday song. Go ahead, Miss Ludvigsen. The school year passed done with arithmetic, Danish and grammar Now we have free time free, free, free, free now we have holidays now school is over now we have free time free, free, free, free now we have closed the school books Now we have to go out into the fields and meadows now every girl and boy is cheering Now we have free time free, free, free, free now we have school summer holidays The school bell rings no more homework for this year Sugar... Pop, sugar. Sugar... Keep quiet and be a good pop boy. I'm standing in the middle of the chocolate here. Good day. Poppe have sugar. I do not have time! The guests will arrive immediately. Old sissy boy. Ha, ha, old sissy boy. Can you be nice? Clap your nose! You are naughty! Thanks and goodbye. You can add water to the coffee. (the doorbell rings) Aah no, just now it's not the ones who are already coming. It is terrible if... - Hello. Hello. The newspaper. - Fine. Here you go, there is a crown. - Thank you. Two 25-cents bagwards. - You have one left. There is a draw list today. I probably won't win... anyway. 620, now we'll see sometime... Aah no, no, no. However, there is no hope... Fourth column, it's three, four... 40... 620! 5000! Well, it was... It must be... It must be a typo! 40... 620. 5000 crowns! The milk! It boils over! It boils over! Yes, I can see that myself! - Oh, no! - It's boiling over! No, now that can be enough! It was incredible. (the doorbell rings) Aah no, what is it? Press again, Sis. Good day, Uncle Anders. - Is that you? What do you want? - You invited us yourself. Well... Aah! Well then come inside. Thank you. - Here you go, Mrs. Sejersen. - Thank you. - Here you go. A small flower. - Thank you. Well, Uncle Anders though. Yes, little Sis. Here you go. Now I must be ready immediately. To what? Do you have to leave? Yes, shall we...? Oh no... Pardon. I am totally confused today. - I really have to apologize for that. - The hat. What? The hat? Well, the hat, yes. Oh no. - Yes, you are confused, Uncle Anders. - It's getting worse and worse. - The old man has gone completely mad. - Yes, he's got a mouse on the cornice. It was great to see you. A very warm welcome! And thank you very much for the lovely flowers. I wonder where they went? - They put them there in the cupboard. - I wonder why I did it? - Yes, why? - There they are indeed. Those are gorgeous, how pretty they are. You must have them! Anders, old boy. Come along and relax. You are completely beside yourself. - Shall we relax? - Now come and sit down. - You're completely out of your mind. - Off the flip? Nah, like that! Is there something wrong? Has something happened? - Yes! - Well then come up with it. We have... We have won the lottery. Is our number out?! DKK 5,000 to share! Hooray! - It's nothing to be sad about. - Just turn off the tap. Very hearty congratulations! - Is it for me? - Yes. Thank you very much, little Mrs. Sejersen. What a lot of vacation and nice fresh air you could get for that money, - - right, little daddy? Yes. Yes. I, for one, do not think we are allowed to... ... to give up going on holiday. You're absolutely right, Dad! You too, Uncle Anders. Thank you very much, my boy. The chocolate... the chocolate! Here you go, all together, to go to table. - Then I'll come right away. - Now I have to help you. It's a shame to cover Poppe at this time of day. There you go. Does the Pop boy want a piece of sugar? Here you go. - Dad, where are we going? - What about Jutland? - Jutland is always good. - We've been there. - Zealand then. - There we are! What about Funen? It must be so beautiful on Funen. I got it! Italy! Yes! They shoud go to Capri. The Blue Grotto. Vesuvius standing and spouting. See Naples and die! It sounds creepy. I'm not going there. Now I know! Land of the Midnight Sun. High to the north, where you can see the sun dipping its burning disk into the sea - - and lower its color brilliance over the breathtaking mountain and fjord landscapes. You'd better stay home and go to the theatre. - You can use your imagination there. - I'll do that one day too! Exactly! It's Peter! - Hey, Peter. - Hi, Sis. - AM I late? - No, we have only just begun. - You look happy. - So am I. - For what? - Will tell you later. What was it you wanted to tell me? Now don't be sad, but I have to travel. - I have to substitute for a colleague. - Now in the middle of the summer holidays? It means money, and the chief physician asked me for it. Doctor Clausen is one of his old friends, appendicitis. - When are you leaving? - Tonight. To Bornholm. To Bornholm! You could have said that immediately! The problem is solved. We are going to Bornholm. - It was an excellent idea. - Hooray! - I don't understand a word. - It does not matter. Sit down. How do you get the money, huh, Uncle Anders? You just go and hand over the note. - The note! - What is it, Uncle Anders? - The note! - Yes. Dear God, where is...? You got it! - Me? Nah, you have it. - Me? Yes, you got it on the day it was due for renewal. They put it and the money in the wallet. Did I do that? Then it must be there. You wanted to save it so it wouldn't get lost. It is also terrible, you have been so distracted. You can't remember from nose to mouth. It is not there. It is gone! - Can you not get the money at all? - No, you can't do that. Then it's all ruined. Then we won't go on holiday at all. Shut up now, Mie. Stop making a scene. Scene? Create... Cabinet! I have it! I know! - All right, here it is. - Well done, old friend. It was good. It was a strange place. It can't get lost here! It sits where it sits. And it fits well. We will never get rid of it. Nonsense. You take a wet sponge. It is the pearl. I go with the note and collect the money. Thank you, my son. - Thank God, I found it. - Thank God! (there's a knock on the door) Go ahead. Sorry. Is this where you can withdraw lottery winnings? We have won 5000 crowns. Yes, it is. Do you have the note? Yes, my sons are bringing it now. You can come in, boys. There it is! Sis! Can I take this with me? Think you'll need your new dress? You never know. Maybe there is a summer ball. Yes, yes then. Otherwise, we don't have enough suitcases. So what? Mrs Sejersen would like to lend us one. Oh, Sis, I'm so excited. It is sweet of Mrs Sejersen that she will look after Poppe while we are away. - Only now it behaves properly. - Yes. Poppe have sugar. Poppe have sugar. Sugar! Sugar! Here! Here is a piece of sugar. And must we then be free of that nonsense? Will you be quiet, will you? (Poppe laughs) - Shame on you! - Shame on yourself. - Can you use this one? - Yes, thank you very much. Mie? Just put it up in father's room. Is there anything else I can help with? Do you want to water the flowers? - You can believe that I will. - Here is the key, here you go. - And a very happy holiday, everyone. - Yes, please. I should never have promised Uncle Anders to look after that parrot. It uses the most terrifying expressions. - He also bought it from a sailor. - Then I can understand it better. Do you know what it shouted this morning? Out to the entire neighborhood. The evil dammit cursed. (the phone is ringing) Now I have to. Yes, hello? Yes, just a moment. It is from Bornholm. It's probably Peter. Yes? Hello, honey. Unfortunately, I have bad news. There is no way to build a room on the whole island. It is absolutely impossible. Aah no, you don't say that? But then what? Give me your phone number and we'll call when dad gets home. Godhome 17, doctor Clausen. Yes. Well, have a good time. Bye, honey. - What was the matter? - Everything was busy. I thought so! Something always has to get in the way! Uh-uh! Here we come, here we come four handsome guys With money in our pocket and your plane tickets in order. - Look what I've got. - Are you ready, girls? It's nice of you. But it is of no use at all. - Peter has called. Everything is occupied. - We can't get anywhere to live. - The balloon ran out of gas. - What do we do then? You may well say. Now expensive advice is cheap. - No, now good advice is expensive. - That's also what I said. Now advice is expensive... Now advice is cheap... - Now good advice is expensive! - How expensive, Uncle Anders? Yes... - A ten for the best idea. - Okay, here with it. - I have to hear it first, right? - We are of course in a tent! - Yes! - Fuck that... I mean, ugh. - Oh yes, father. - Yes, why not? I do not really know. There is so much crawling. Ah yes, Uncle Anders. It could be so fun. - We wanted to have so much fun. - Yes, yes, yes... Well! Then we fly! Fly, fly to holiday country fly, fly as fast as you can fly us from the cities high above the clouds fly us right into the happy glow of the summer sun Fly, fly to holiday country fly to forest and beach fly towards the sky blue fly from the gray of everyday life fly us right to summer holiday paradise Fly, fly the air express goes to the holiday country fly, fly once again, you'd better get the address Fly, fly to holiday country fly to shower and sand fly against the heart's song sun all day long fly as fast as you can to the happy land of the summer holidays The airplanes have singing in the cabins in the air there is nothing heavy fly, the engines hum so the words can be heard quite clearly when they sing Uncle Anders! Can't you come and tighten that bar dune here? - What do you say? - Come and tighten that bar dune here. While I hold. Ahh! Aah no, Uncle Anders though! Did you hurt yourself? Too crazy! It's worse than a cruise ship! It's also... idiotic! A worse outdoor life, this one! No, now I honestly need another view. Nature must be so gorgeous around here. Are you going up and...? That was a good idea, Uncle Anders. Can you handle yourselves, children? Then we go a moment. Then you can also raise our tent. Bye for now. Nah, but we'd better go to the macaroons. - I'm hungry! - You won't get any food until we're done. They never get that tent up. They are as good at it as a cow is at playing the violin. - Such amateurs! - Ha! Hello! Welcome to Bornholm, my love. I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up. - I had to go to the hospital. - Is that the doctor's car? Yes. I am welcome to use it. When he heard you were coming, of course you had to stay with me. It won't work. What about the others? You can take them off during the day, right? Yes, but the children. They cannot do without me. I can't do that either. Not at all. Come. Well, how's work going? Is it progressing? There! Now I have to help you a little. Just take it. We're just going to loosen them up here. - Where are father and uncle Anders at? - They wanted to go and look at the view. - Did they say... - Well, well. Aah, how beautiful it is here. - Yes, magnificent, one might say. - Wonderful, wonderful. - Cheers, Uncle Anders. - Cheers, my dear friend. Uncle Anders, can you see him there? He must be able to tell where we can fish. - Can you speak Bornholm? - Should there be anything difficult in that? - Then go and ask him. - Yes, I can easily do that. Hi! Can the gentleman tell me where you can borrow a boat? One day that you want to go out... and fish fish? Nah... yes, yes. Such a boat... a ship... - F...f...fis... fish, fish? - Oh, yes... I did not immediately understand what you meant. But you can borrow a boat from him down by the herring harbour. You can just say, You come from me. I know he's home. What do they say? I did not immediately understand what you meant. They can borrow a boat at the herring harbour. Just say you come from me. I know he's home. - Well, what did he say? - I have no idea. You said you could speak Bornholm. Yes, I! He was the one you couldn't understand. Pull up to the cart and pick up a bag of buns. They are on the back seat. See. - They're raised? - Who? The tents. Oh! Aah, the tents, yes! - It probably looks nice here. - Come on, let's see. You and Uncle Anders sleep in here, and the children sleep in there. Come and sit down. - Tea will be ready soon. - Here are buns. - Per, you can sit here, right? - Then I sit here. - We have to make a plan for your holiday. - Right! There must be house rules. - Every morning at eight are all up. - I thought we were on holiday. Be quiet now, little father. Then I will come down to you with hot spices. I forgot to tell you, I'm going to stay with Peter. Oh! Listen, what is this? I am with you all day and take care of your food. At twelve there is lunch, at six there is dinner. And otherwise we can just do what we want? And then we have to sleep alone! Hooray! - We're going fishing. - And bathe. - And take pictures! - And have fun! We'd also like to see the island's sights, shouldn't we? Maybe I can drive you up to Hammershouse. - What is it? - Do not you know it? You must have his school fees back. - Yes, please. - It is Denmark's largest castle ruin. There where Eleonora Christine and Corfitz Ulfeldt sat as prisoners in 1661. Until one night they escaped and cowered down the rocks. - Oh, did they get away? - No, they were caught and brought back. It was probably annoying! - Then there are buns for everyone. - Go and eat as much as you want. - Thank you, little lady. - Aah, I'm begging, Uncle Anders. The knife can be borrowed here. It cuts very well. Here you go, Sis. The evening sun fades, a day is over the flowers says nicely good night the moon man finds his lamp and wood we both have to admit that The heart beats sweetly when you have a cheek to cackle with in the moonlight to some gentle music from a nightingale then we forget all the pain in the world a lovely summer evening have no peace of mind lovers all over the world hum two by two The heart beats sweetly when you have a cheek to cackle with in the moonlight All stars are twinkling they know the message all the stars of heaven small it's as if they're waving familiarly down here and whispers we can understand Oh yes, who was young and in love. Yes, it was then. (remote thunder) - I think it's thundering. - Yes, as long as it's not stormy. Now it's lightning! - I guess we'll get a proper rinse. - It could look like that. Now it is raining. So, now it crashes! Yes, it certainly does too. - We run into us. - Now look to get to bed. Goodnight Dad. Good night, Uncle Anders. Just run off. We'll fix this. - Shouldn't I rather stay the night? - No, we'll probably manage it. Come here, Sis. We take it full circle. Come on! Hello! Wait a minute! Won't you borrow this one? Uncle Anders? Isn't it also nice to lie in a tent? Yes, it was a good idea, that was it. Yes! (mooh) (the cow roar) Mie, wake up! Ole! - Ih, how scared I was. - I got a complete shock. Who...who...why that though? It was j...j...just a cow. - You are shaking with skraek! - W...w...well I won't! Well you do...do...then that. Look to get in the clothes! We have to go shopping. Go to the farm and buy eggs and milk. (snoring) No! There is a cow! There is a cow! (mooh) Go home with you! Go home with you! Good little cow, yes, yes. Good little cow. (the cow roars) It was the worst thing I ever... Hurry up. Come over here, Uncle Anders. - Oh no, Uncle Anders. - Stupid dunes! (the cow roars) - It runs with our tent! - Help, help! After it! Run, run, run! Don't run with our tent! No, no! Phew! Can you come away with you! Come here, Uncle Anders. Be careful it doesn't come after you. The sun is shining, it gives fresh cheeks cheerfully I find the right way Good morning, good morning to the whole farm for horses, pigs, sheep and goats for the farmer on his farm good morning, good morning to the whole farm good morning to the calm bull to all the animals of the farm The sheep says "maeh maeh" how funny that sounds the pig grunts "oink, oink, oink, oink, oink" and it means Good morning, good morning from the whole farm hear, the stork says good morning to the new day from the roof of the house The farmer empties the milk pail we smile and say to each other Good morning, good morning to the whole farm to the dog, who has laid down and is gaping his jaws good morning, good morning to the whole farm to the pussy cat, who is happy that now it has to have breakfast The cow bleats "mooh, mooh" hears how funny it sounds mother duck says "rap, rap, rap, rap, rap" and it means Good morning, good morning from the whole farm hey, the rooster crows "coc- kilicoo" good morning, we'll start again - Excuse me, can you buy eggs here? - That you can. - What do they cost? - Two crowns and 88 cents. - A piece? - No, the kilo. Oh! - How many are there per kilo? - A 14-16 pieces. - Then I would like to have a kilo. - Can I buy two liters of milk? You can. Can you pop down to the harbor and buy smoked herring? Here you have two crowns. - Should I buy herring for the whole thing? - Yes. Shouldn't there be a small popsicle in between? Just a little one? Here in the middle of the morning? Don't talk about. We have enough money. Not too, Ole? That's why you don't have to mess with them. Off you go! - Just a tiny popsicle? - Can you come with you then! - Why do they have to be hung on poles? - They must be dried. - And then they must be smoked. - Yes. You are welcome to go in and see. Oh, look! They shine like gold. They probably taste nice. Want some red herring? - Yes please. For two crowns. - You must have that. - Oh, they're really hot. - Yes, you can believe they are lovely. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, my boy. Whoa, you there! Give me my hat. Well, I don't want to. You can collect it yourself. Now I have to take it to you. - Pick it up. - Well, I don't want to. - Then pick it up. - Well, I don't want to. Then we pick up the hat neatly and lay it on the table. Release! - And then we say sorry. - Sorry. - What did you say? - Sorry! You have to pay for that. Why didn't you help me? After all, he couldn't pick up his hat himself. He is in a wheelchair. Oh yeah. But that's why the other doesn't have to be so naughty, right? - Here you go. - Thanks. Sit down. Do you want an ice cream? - Yes please. - Two ice cream cones. - Some worse ones, huh? - You could fix them. Well, you have your scams. Is there something wrong with the leg? No, with both of them. - Have you broken them? - No, I'm paralyzed. I cannot walk. Oh. - Here you go. - Thanks. They can take the soda. Here, it just hits. - Thank you. - Cheers! - Do you live upstairs in the hotel? - Nah, we are down in the harbour. Are you down in the harbor? I came sailing yesterday with my grandfather. Come down and see the ship one day. It's called Vesta. I'd like that. Can I bring my brother and sister? - Yes, go ahead. - Thanks. Then we are ready for departure. It's nice, Hansen. Then we roll home. - Don't forget what you promised. - I'll come. - For the rest, my name is Torben. - And my name is Per. Oh, how beautiful it is here! You feel like a completely different person. Congratulations! May I then be free. What a shame father and uncle Anders didn't come along. I can understand that they would rather go fishing. - They don't catch anything anyway. - Look! - So, now we're there. - Well? Ladies and gentlemen, 'ladies and gentlemen,' - - here you see the famous Hammershouse ruins. A proud memory from the old days. In this fortress many a battle was fought - - with weapons, grunts, shots and screams. Today, this spot breathes only idyllic and peace. (loud bang) Ouch! There we punctured! - It's over here. - Is that all? - It was good that we got this far. - Yes, for the hell of it! - Aarh, it's completely flat. - Oh yes. Go on in advance. I will change the wheel immediately. You can also easily find us. Come here. - Should I help you? - No thanks. - Oops! Don't you want this with you? - Yes, darnit. - lh, how interesting is this, huh? - Yes, it's beautiful. Sis! Come over here. Was this the one Christine splashed down? - Who do you say? - Her Eleonora. So, Per. Sis! Here's enough of a run-through. - Ole! Will you come down then! - Come, Sis, the two of us are going this way. Mie, sit still for a moment and I'll take a picture of you. And then one where you stand up, so you can see how dangerous it is. A little further back. A little longer. Thanks. It turned out to be a very good picture. Ugh, I could have killed myself! - What would you have said then? - Nothing. By then it was too late. You, look down there. What do you think it is? Someone is filming. - Oh yes. It is. - Come! Just put the 2A around here. Is the pair in? - Yes, it's in. - That's good. Have you seen her over there? It's probably the female star. No, no, Lilly! You mustn't look too groomed in this scene. You just came from the mysterious house. You ran through the woods, unhappy. - I am aware of that. - Allan, come, hurry. I'm afraid the sun is going down. You stand behind the fire stack. You jump forward and grab her. - And drags her into the thicket. - Should I scream? Yes. The whole thing has to seem as creepy as possible. Dramatic. People in the cinema must be horrified. - Difficult when you have no reply. - We must be difficult, little Allan? Not at all, little Henry. Do you want to show how to go? Yes, come here. Now, Lilly, you go up to that tree and start. - And then I hide behind. - Oh, how exciting! Shhh. Sssh, be quiet, there! Ready for testing! Try it, Go on! 242. - You were supposed to scream! - Ah yes, I forgot that. - Allan? - Yes. Give me your jacket. God, it's not that hard, is it? You go around behind the fire pile and you go to the start up by the tree. Now remember to scream! It must seem creepy, right? Come on! Are you ready for the test? Fine. Trial, go ahead! 242. (female scream) Ouch! Little insane person! What are you doing? I have him! Help! Help! Let go, I say! Let go of me! (loud scream) It sat. - Are you crazy, boy? - He must not hit my sister! Come here. Carry him out, he's passed out. He benefits from that, then he can just be decent. - He assaulted that lady. - It was a film shoot. They have put us in a difficult situation! Why should you interfere? Sorry, but that looked creepy. That was also the intention. I couldn't know it wasn't real. No, no. Then... Yes, yes. Henry, I think I sprained my foot. - No, that was unfortunate. - Ouch! - Where is Allan? - He's lying in the truck. - My foot is much worse. - Then we have to finish for today. - I'm not going to go for the time being. - Damn it. What happened? What's up, Sis? It was a filming and Sis came and hit him on the head. - And then I got to hit a man. - Yes, yes, yes. Yes, and then came... Wait here a moment. I must apologize to you. It was a misunderstanding. Yes, yes, it is excellent. Where do you get hold of a doctor? - Here. - Are you a doctor? - We were probably lucky there. - Is it the foot that's wrong? Yes, I tripped. Ouch! It is sprained, there is no doubt about that. A bandage must be applied. - Do you live in the vicinity? - Yes, right up at the hotel. Ole! Come here and take hold. - Like that, yes. - Ouch! Ouch, ouch! - Well, finally. How are you? - Fine. Ouch! The recording has been canceled for today. Get up and lie down. I would first like to say hello to the lady who gave me this. Ouch! It was no lady, it was me! But she was the one who started it. - You must apologize for that. - They even look so sweet. Very sweet. You, Henry, now you must hear. Couldn't the little lady duplicate Lilly? Yes, maybe. Then we could take the scene tomorrow. In remote view. In distant image, good idea, little Allan. - Duplicates? - Yes, that means, stepped instead. They will play the stage instead of Lilly Lund. - I dare not. - Well, Sis. - What a chance! - No, Mie. You can become a star. It just had to be me. You cannot be familiar with that. It's all your fault. My sister wants to anyway. That's a deal, then. If the weather is good, we will take it tomorrow. - Where do they live? - At Doctor Clausen's. - Brilliant! - I do not think... They should probably get a small check. - How small? - Shhh, Peter! May I take a picture? A moment. A historic moment... perhaps. Thanks. Ah, all the eels we caught ohoej, ohoe they were fried before they were caught oh high, oh high Shh! What do you think you catch there? If you catch anything at all. Shut up, Uncle Anders! You chase all the fish away when you gag. We'd like to have a bite, wouldn't we? Should it be overbite or underbite? Shh! (Uncle Anders hiccups) Oops! My hat! Sorry, Uncle Anders. Sorry. Can you reach it? (loud scream) I thought so. It's the way you hold it. Yes, as far as I'm concerned, I'd rather have a carrot pate - - with parsley sauce. I give up! Anders, we're going home! But why that? We have such a good time. Then you must keep quiet. I don't want to hear another word. Have you seen that boat there? It's not really smart. He's coming straight at us! Stop!!! Stop!!! Turn to starboard! Man on board! Starboard! Bless you. Bless you. Bless you. - Then stop with that bless you! - Achoo! Well, you two crazy Vikings, here's tea. Thanks, that was just what we needed. - Is there rum in it? - No. I thought so. - It is genuine West Indian rum. - Can I have some? Thank you. It is pure medicine! - Cheers, you old man. - Cheers. There it is. It's the one over at the other pier. - It's smart, isn't it, Mie? - lh yes. It must have been expensive. - Grandpa. - Yes, my boy. - Now comes Per, I told you about. - That was nice. - So you're happy, huh? - He is absolutely right. - Hello! - Hello! Good day, you three. Just come on board. You have to go down there. Thank you. Good day, children. Just come down with you guys. - It's Per, can I understand? - Yes, good day. - And that's Ole and Mie. - Good day. Just sit down. It was good you could find down here. Torben was so happy. - Ih, how delicious it is here. - Top notch. Whoa, there we have the Copenhagen boat. - Would you like to see it through binoculars? - Well, thank you. - Will you, my boy? - Aw, that's binoculors, I thought it was a cannon. - Can you see the ship? - Yes, all of it. - Can you also see the passengers? - Yes, it's probably fun. - Oh, thank you! - What is it? - It is Mrs. Sejersen herself! - Nonsense, man! Let me. Yes, it is too. In own tall person. - What do we do now? - Is there something wrong, children? Yes, it's a lady we know who lives at home on our road. - I think we must accept her. - Then you'd better do that. Thanks for today. Come on, Per. Nah, I'd rather stay here. So if I may? - You can believe that, you must. - Then we run. Bye for now. - Would you like to see the inside of the ship? - Yes please. You just ran ahead. We'll be right back. Listen, Lars! Come a moment. Well, let's both have a soda. Or maybe cocoa and some cakes. Yes, I'd rather have a soda... and some cookies. You'll get that. - Here is nice. - Yes, just look around. - What's out there? - It's the pantry. - Aah, such a kind of kitchen? - Yes. - Oh, there must be plenty of space. - Yes, there is berthing space for eight here. It must be a lovely holiday, sailing around in a floating hotel. Yes, I like it. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Now you have to see. It is for you. - Thank you. - It's an ocarino. - One you can play on? I have traded it with a boy for my water gun and two chocolate frogs. It was probably pretty of you. Thank you. You're welcome. Shall I show you how to play? Yes, go ahead. I'll never learn that. It's as easy as scratching your neck. I'll help you. Should we drink those sodas before they get hot? Yes let's do that. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - There she is. - She has the Pop boy with her. Yes, she has that too. Good day, Mrs. Sejersen. But! Are you there, children? Hello. Hello. - Let me take the suitcase. - Shouldn't I take Poppe? - Where are you going to live? - I have the address here in my bag. It's with a fisherman something-or-other. Yes, here it is. We know where that is. And you have Poppe with you. Uncle Anders will be happy. - Yes, is he going? - There he is! Uncle Anders! Nah, what do I see?! Good day, Mrs. Sejersen, is that you? - And you have Poppe with you. - You can believe that I have. Aah, Poppe... They have come the long way to please me, - - that's probably sweet of you. I have only come to deliver your bird. It is a very naughty bird. What words it uses! On Friday it bit my finger. What do you say to that? I say: It was a good thing it wasn't in the nose. But you should still be thanked. Is there anything I can help you with? - Where are you going to live? - We know that. - We follow Mrs. Sejersen there. - Excellent, see you later. - There is a big Sanct Hans party tonight. - That's right, it's the 23rd. It really is. Well, see you again. Come on, little Poppe. - There will be fireworks in the harbour. - And music and dancing. - With a shooting tent and everything like that. - That sounds funny. (car honks) Y-do you drive like that over here too? It was the film actor with whom Sis will film. - Is Sis going to film? - Yes. Yes. - It's a great chance! - Sis?! Yes, she might end up as a star. You must also appear in a bathing suit. On the front page of all the country's newspapers: 'Young female doctor wife saves filming on Bornholm.' I thought you came to vacation with your family and me. And don't run around making a fool of yourself! What was it? - What did you say? - That's what I said, yes. Why should I be laughed at? It must not ruin anything between us. But it's not for you at all. - What do you know about it? - Well, Sis. You film? Does it sound so strange? Maybe I have talent. - You're not at all to talk to? - No, Peter. We speak from all over the world. (car honks) There he is. Then I run. Do you want to go out and cower with him the movie hero? - If you do not mind. - I have! So you're jealous? - Well, dear, then come along. - You know you can't let that go. I have been called out for a birth. In the middle of the island! Then I hope it will be twins. You would benefit from that. Goodbye, sweet Peter. Such a... such an actor! - Well, the doctor is about to leave? - Yes. - Here's the coffee. - Thank you. - When will the doctor come back? - It's hard to say. - Ouch! - Ah, did the doctor burn himself? God yes, I burned myself! - Was it too hot? - No, no, no. Yes, it was too hot. It was a shame. That doesn't matter. Not at all. Nothing matters at all. Farewell, Miss Kofoed. I thought we were going to Hammershouse. We should too, but there will be no recording. Lilly Lund refuses to be duplicated. She wants to play herself when she is healthy. - So I'm not going to film? - Unfortunately. But the instructor says we want to take a test film of you in Copenhagen. So you don't have to be sad. I am not. I am rather relieved. That doesn't sound flattering. I was looking forward to playing with you. I think you are an unusually lovely young girl. Then would you perhaps be so kind as to drive me home again? Why? We are sitting so nicely. Undisturbed, I mean. - May I then be free! - Ouch! Wait a minute! Pretty please. I know I have behaved very wrongly. My husband would think so too. - What? Are they married? - Yes. Coincidentally. And happily married. Ah, my heel! Wait, now I have to. Wait, I'll be there now. Here! Here it is. I was lucky there, huh? - It's nothing to laugh at. - Yes, because now I have to drive you home. - There is too far to jump. - They are a beast. - Admitted, and then we are good friends again. - Give me my heel. Are we friends? Is there a little smile left? - They are absolutely impossible. Yes. - Here you go, here you go. I hope you have another pair of shoes. I had expected us to swing by the party. - Then you have to recalculate. - Is your husband jealous? You can believe he is. Very jealous. It wasn't that good. Now how do we manage it? Yes, I get a brilliant idea! We'll take him with us. Simply! - Soren. - I have won. - You are always lucky. - What do you get? - Here you go. - Thanks. - No, how sweet it is. - It's a nursing home. Didn't I win anything? No, unfortunately, little friend. Better luck next time. - Here you have a small comfort reward. - Thanks. - Shall I inflate it for you? - Nix. Leave him alone though. - You need to breathe, man! - I do that too. It doesn't last. - The flow is probably just bad. - It said something just before. Yes, there it is. Oh, no. Be careful it doesn't explode. (bang) (the flute) - Did you swallow it? - Try spitting it out. (the flute) - What are we going to do with you? - (the flute) - It is fun! - Stop your stupid laugh. Hold it. Come on, Per. - Father, father! - What is there, though? - Per has swallowed a balloon. - With music in it. (the flute) What fun! It sounds like a locomotive. Again! (the flute) It sits at the bottom of the neck. - Then something happens. - Well what? It doesn't matter then. - Turn the bottom upside down on him. - Oh yes, we could do that. (the flute) (coughs) - Here it is. - It was good. There you can see how careful you have to be with what you put in your mouth. You are indeed right about that. - Uh-uh! - Uh-uh! Hey! - Our father is sitting here. - Yes, that's him there without the beard. Hello. Hello. Don't you want to sit here with us? Yes, thank you, I would like to. - Shouldn't we take Torben with us? - Drive around and look at it all? I would like to. Then it's probably best, I'll have some fun for you. - I think you should be cashier. - Thank you. Have fun, kids. Be carefully now. Go ahead to take a seat. - It's Mrs Sejersen and uncle Anders. - It makes me very happy. - Howdy, Peter. - Hi, kids. This is my new friend. His name is Torben. May I offer the doctor a little sausage? - Or two. They are really good. - No thanks. Where is Sis? - She dances with the movie actor. - Well, does she do that? - There he is. - Is that your husband? - Shall we tease him a little? - We pretend we don't see him. He looks like he could eat a tiger. - I have to fix him quickly. Wait. - Well, what do you want to do? He will get the biggest surprise of his life. - Hi, you old man. - Is it really you, 87? - Old soldier comrade. - And you 48, old bone carver. - Yes, because you became a doctor, right? - Yes. Yes. - It's great to see you again. - Thank you all the same, you old man. - Tell me, do you two know each other? - Do we know each other?! - Old comrades in arms. - We slept together in Holbaek. - Those were the days. - Do you remember the sergeant? - Him we called Powder-Henrik. - Because he hadn't invented it. - And 33. - He always ran away without a night sign. And him, we called The Cut Plate. Yes, because he always got spanked. You, how about an beer? no. I have to reach the boat at 11 in Roenne. I am late. - It was a shame. - We must see each other another time. - Goodbye, madam. It was nice. - Thanks, and the same to you. - You have a lovely wife. - I am aware of that. With a steady hand. See you later. Well, then we'll play the Bornholm Waltz. Denmark has received an absolutely priceless benefit from nature Funen and Jutland and Zealand and Lolland-Falster and not at least Bornholm, Bornholm, Bornholm you my lovely holiday island Bornholm, Bornholm, Bornholm at the glorious Baltic Sea My Bornholm, your girls are so pretty right from Sandvig to Nexoe and Roenne Bornholm, Bornholm, Bornholm thank you for holiday joy, my friend Bornholm, we will meet again Denmark has many beautiful regions and what is my favourite? It is as rock-solid as the good Bornholm granite (loud bang) - The witch goes to Bloksbjerg. - Do you want to come, Mrs. Sejersen? Go and look at it, I mean. Father, now the witch must be fired. She is sitting on a space rocket. - A space rocket?! - Yes, a sputnik! - Listen, we really have to see. - Now the witch must be kicked off! - Who wants to kill the witch? - Yes, it will! Quiet, it must be an adult. - What about you, my lord? - Me? Nah, ugh. - They're not afraid, are they? - What should I be afraid of? Well done! Now I'd better find Torben. It was a pleasure to greet you. Thanks, and the same to you. The children are coming. Well, Torben, now you have to say goodnight. We two must see to get on board. - Thanks for tonight. - You're welcome. - Goodbye, Torben. - And then we return. - Will you come down again soon? - Yes, tomorrow. - Is it safe? - Swear! Goodbye. Hello. - Phew, how hot it is tonight. - Yes. - You look so serious. - We think it's such a shame for Torben. - Right, dad? - Yes, my boy. It's a shame he can't run around and play. - Has he always been like that? - Only the last few years. It is a mental paralysis. It was a car accident. His parents were killed. The boy got a shock. Since then he has not been able to walk. - A shock? - A sudden fright? Yes, such a fright can cause paralysis. - So is he never going to walk again? - Maybe. If one day he gets another shock. I have read about a young girl in Sweden who had been paralyzed for several years. One day lightning struck the house. It was engulfed in flames. - She was so scared, she ran. - Did she run? Yes, she got a shock so she forgot she couldn't walk. Well... They are welcome to take it here. We must see how to get home, child. - Listen, where is uncle Anders? - Here we are! Nah, what a lot you've won, huh? Yes, there is so much luck with Uncle Anders. Let's get going, children. Ole... - Ole! - Yes, what is it? It's Per. He's not here. Well, so what? Didn't you see he was so strange on the way home? He didn't say a word. Ah, he will come. No! At least I'm standing up. Oh yeah. - Look, there he sits. - Let's call him. Sssh. No. - What is it, Per? - Nothing. - Why are you sitting here? - Per. I sit and think about Torben. You heard for yourself what father told about that girl over there in Sweden. Yes, about the shock she got, she suddenly ran. I think I could figure out how to give Torben such a shock. Could you? How would you cope? I'd drive him down the path over there - - and go out on the rock and fall in where the water is deepest. You can swim. Torben doesn't know that. He'll think I can't handle it. Then he gets so startled, he comes and helps you? Yes, because I want to pretend I'm drowning - - and call him. It sounds creepy! Just nothing happens. - Ah, Per swims like a fish. - When do you want to do it? I wait for a day when there is no one on the beach. For example when it is windy. That's a damn good idea. Mie and I will probably be in the vicinity. - If you need us. - We'll probably be there. You like Torben a lot, don't you? Yes. We have become friends. You are a journeyman, brother. I think it's cold here. Now it's time to get home in the bag. Who comes first? You look so strange. Has something happened? You'd better ask Uncle Anders himself. - The animal fumbles around... - What's the matter? - Poppe has flown away! - Oh, no! I think I saw a big bird high up. - Which way did it fly? - Beyond the water, over towards Sweden. It can't even speak Swedish. - What should we do? - Place an ad in the newspaper. 'Parrot flew away. Big reward.' No, we never see it again anyway. You don't have to be sad, Uncle Anders. It will probably come again. Well, it won't. Now they must be here soon. I'm shaking all over. Only now it's going well. - Hear. - There they come. (whistling) Now you just have to see. Here you can sit in shade. - Where are you going? - Nowhere. I'll stay with you. But I'll just go out and see how deep it is. Per! Beware! Ah, nothing happens. Per! Per! Help! Help! - Torben! - Per! I am coming! - Well, you could swim! - Yes, but you can go. - You can go! - Yes. Bravo, bro. You know what? The thing with Torben is a miracle. What luck, we came to Bornholm. It was the destiny... and Doctor Clausen's appendix. So, Peter. Such. Go over to the other side. - How are you? - We'll be done soon. - Isn't that right, Uncle Anders? - You could say that. That... Where the hell is...? One moment, I'll be right back! I just can't figure it out. Nah... It's honestly a dangerous mess with the tents. First they must be raised, then they overturn, then they must be raised again. Then peel down, then roll up. I don't think it's particularly funny. Now the man is here to send the tents. Then we must be finished. Hurry up. - Where is Per? - On board with Torben. Think his grandfather will sail us home. Up along the Swedish coast. He will do anything for us. Oh, how I rejoice! Uh-uh! Are they ready soon? The wind is freshening. We will take off as soon as l has come on board. Well done! All men on deck! - You better take this one. - Your cage, Uncle Anders. - Grandpa. - Yes, what is it? - There they are. - Well, that was good. - Run up and meet them. - Should I? - Yes. Race. - Yes! Are you with everyone? Hey, Torben. - Very welcome. - Thank you thank you. Uncle Anders. Come here, boy. Don't you want to come anyway, Sis? No thanks, I'll stay with my husband. It is my duty. - And she's not sea strong either. - Seastrong? lh, you all-merciful! - Neither am I! - But it doesn't storm either. - Very welcome on board. - Thank you very much. And thank you very much for letting us sail along. - Can you handle it? - Yes, please. - It's just going forward. - Oh, here sit? Bye. Bye! - Nice trip. - Have a good trip, everyone. (Poppe laughs) Hello. Hello. God! Well, it is... It was Poppe. Now I have enough...! It was Poppe who... Pop! He's sitting up there! As long as he doesn't fall down! - Poppe, will you come down here! - Pop boy! - Now I have to get it for you. - Yes, hurry up. Pop! Pop! - Ah no, I don't like it. - Per can handle it. - Now don't fall down, Per! - Beware! Good day. Poppy? Poppe, good boy. Now he has it! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! It was good! It was good, my boy. Oh. Little Per, in with him. Like that, yes. - There. - Good, little man. Daddy's little Poppe. --- Subtitles by Essery. ---
