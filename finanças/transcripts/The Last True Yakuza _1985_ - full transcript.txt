TOEI COMPANY, LTD., PRESENTS It's Kawana. I'm positive. The packages are here. There's four. Welcome. Which family do you belong to? Hey, let's go. The Kawana group was the largest yakuza family in the Hokuriku. The boss, Isamu Kawana was killed in a coffee shop in Fukui Prefecture by four hit men who pumped him with three bullets April 13, 1977 by four hit men who pumped him with three bullets The Fukui prefectural police arrested the four hit men on the same day but... they suspected that there was a mastermind behind the assassination and after investigations, arrested this man, Masayuki Aratani. Boss, Aratani Family Masayuki Aratani Although called the Aratani Family by their fellow yakuza, they were not an official yakuza family, nor did they belong to any association. Masayuki's wife Michiyo nor did they belong to any association. Masayuki's wife Michiyo Most of the group was from Aga, Kure City Masayuki's wife Michiyo and were called Aga people. and were called Aga people. February 25th, 1979, Masayuki Aratani was sentenced. The defendant, Masayuki Aratani is sentenced to 20 years in prison. That's not fair! The Last True Yakuza Aga, Kure City August, 1941 Michiyo, where's your ma? She probably ran off because your pa's a drunk. - Ain't that so? - Ain't it? Why don't you say something? Tadashichi. Don't be a bully. What? Ken-chan! - Tadashichi! - Brother! Masayuki, how dare you hurt my brother! Damn you! Go ahead. Do it. Ma-chan! Ma-chan hurt his friend? I've sent him home with letters from school asking you to supervise him better. I'm so sorry. Ms. Terayama, I'll go apologize at once. I'll go with you. Masayuki didn't used to be like this. He's getting worse. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. Ma-chan, what happened? I can't forgive bullies. You. There's no need to apologize. How dare you speak to your mother like that. It's all right. Masayuki! Uncle, pay back your gambling debts? What? You promised to pay me in three days. - Shut up. - Damn you. You're just a kid. Boss, Ishioka Family Hiroshi Ishioka Boss, Ishioka Family Hiroshi Ishioka What's going on? Boss, Ishioka Family Hiroshi Ishioka He won't pay his gambling debts. All right. Masayuki, how much? I can't take money from you, Boss. Oh yeah? Takichi, I'll lend you the money, so you pay Masayuki back. Thank you. You have to pay your gambling debts. - Michiyo! - Hey, Hiroshi! Ei-chan from Sakashita died in Kure. The scaffolding gave way while he was riveting. Michiyo, cry all you want. Michiyo, I'll take care of you. Mom, carry me. Michiyo, I'll buy you anything you want. Let's go. It was almost the end of the year, December 8, 1941. World WarTwo began. The population of Kure then was 315,610 and in 1943, it increased to 490,000. To manage dangerous occupations like construction, longshoremen and day laborers, the family concept was born. Perhaps the Aga people were suited to such jobs and the Ishioka family business grew in Kure. I'm going to join the Ishioka family. You, a yakuza? You fool. - A yakuza... - I want to. Masayuki! Hey, Masayuki. Masayuki, afteryour mother died, I haven't done anything foryou. Since I got a newwife, you became unmanageable. You seem to respect Boss Ishioka. He could make something of you. But, Masayuki, a yakuza must be prepared to die for honor and obligation at any time. It's not as easy as you think. Pa! Masayuki became the apprentice for the Ishioka family. He stayed true to his father's teaching and endured his hard apprenticeship. Matriarch. You wanted to see me? Masayuki. You may think you're a full grown man, but you don't know the meaning of honor. Matriarch, I value honorvery much. Masayuki, you don't know the first thing about honor. It's your duty to honor your mother. Masayuki, take this and pay your respects to her. Yes, Ma'am. Mom. Ma-chan. This is salted kombu. It's yourfavorite. Matriarch Ishioka gave it to me. Ma-chan... Pa! Dear? Ma-chan called me Mom. He called me Mom. What's the matter with the both of you? I have to go now. He brought me my favorite salted konbu. Masayuki. Mrs. Ishioka is very strict. Have her teach you well. Masayuki, each meal you take from yakuza obligates you to them. Each time you eat, you become more obligated. If you don't honor that obligation people will call you dishonorable. August 15, 1945, the war came to an end with Japan's defeat. Shortly after the war ended, Masayuki had several men under him and was in charge of a gambling joint. Cash. Boss, don't... Brother... Ishioka Group Aratani Group Kato Yoshiharu Sugimoto Ishioka Group Aratani Group Kato Yoshiharu Sugimoto He's going to get in trouble using the house money. Ishioka Group Aratani Group Kato Yoshiharu Sugimoto - Where's the boss? - He's in the back. Ma-chan, don't. - Don't interfere - Ma-chan, stop. Masayuki. Junior Boss, Ishioka Group Daimatsu What's going on? Junior Boss, Ishioka Group Daimatsu I used 2,000 dollars of the house money. Follow me. Masayuki, who do you think you are? I own you. Brother, please don't get mad, for my sake. This can be settled with money. If you're hurt, it will be irreparable. Don't do dumb things among family. Yes. Thank you. Hey, who did this? The Kakiharas... - Hey, stay with me. - Kakihara? Kure hoodlums. They're trying to impress Ohara, that's why. Brother, I'll go. Daimatsu Ohara's young but reasonable. Don't go overboard. Masayuki, bring the sword. Damn you, Daimatsu. - You're Kakihara? - Brother, let me. Masayuki, stay out of this. Boss, Ohara Group Masaru Ohara Boss, Ohara Group Masaru Ohara Daimatsu, I don't see why you're hurting my man. Daimatsu, I don't see why you're hurting my man. Ohara, your man injured our man. What? Damn you. Bro! Take him to the hospital. Step on it. Daimatsu, you hurt Ohara. Why didn't you listen to me? - Boss... - Stay out of this. Boss. I said, don't interfere. Boss, Yamatatsu Group Nobuo Yamatatsu We've formed a bond as brothers. This is Yamatatsu. I'm Nobuo Yamatatsu. I'm new at the transportation business. Hope you'll do business with me. I'm Satake. Please sit. They say a war might start in Korea. We're so busy we need more help at the harbor. I'm counting on you. With you backing me up, I have no worries. It's good to have a brother yakuza. I'm happy to be able to help. Oh, damn. I forgot something. You go ahead. Director, I forgot the most important thing. - Here. - Oh, no, no. It's just a token. I also own a cabaret called Parco. You're always welcome there. If you fancy a girl, I'll introduce you. See you. Ryozo Kano (later Kano Group Boss) Junior Boss, Yamatatsu Group Nozaki He's dead. Junior Boss, Yamatatsu Group Nozaki Junior Boss, Yamatatsu Group Nozaki I put three slugs in him. Junior Boss, Yamatatsu Group Nozaki Nozaki, what's going on? Boss, this itinerant cut two fingers off Mizuno. So this was payback. Who's this man? I heard there was a big fight. So I came along for the fun. You're a human bullet. - Who did this? - I did. - Your name? - Ryozo Kano. You belong to us now. Leave it to me. Yamatatsu was only a boss of a small group then. But he thought Kano was valuable, so he paid his bail of 500 dollars and got him out of jail, planning to take Kano into his family. Thank you. I really like your guts. Are you Mr. Kano? You're Mr. Aratani? Hello, Boss Yamatatsu. What do you want? Brother Daimatsu wrote that Mr. Kano was now a brother yakuza so I came to welcome him. You came all the way? He wrote that you were a level-headed guy so I should be careful. That means you and I are brothers. When Yamatatsu heard things were bad between Boss Ishioka and Daimatsu who was shortly released, he plied Daimatsu with money now that Daimatsu had a respectable wife and tried to weaken the Ishioka group. I chose this place. Don't you think it's ideal for newlyweds? Missus, come this way. See? The kitchen is the most important for a woman. This is great. I'll make lots of good meals foryou. Thank you for being so generous. Don't mention it. Again, Director? I ask you again. I cleared it with Fukuo of Ishioka group. But Hiroshi is the head of Ishioka group. I want to help you, but... Welcome home. What's the matter, Honey? Sister... while Hiroshi is head of the Ishioka group, it's difficult to get any headway. Hiroshi is a thorn in my side. The harbor's doing a booming business. Leave it to me. This is where I show what I'm made of. Honey, you have a plan? Kuniko, what's Ryozo doing? He got into a fight with hoodlums last night and he stabbed one in both legs. He's on parole. That fool. If Ryozo can't, I'll have to take care of Ishioka. You're my money man. Ryozo's a human bullet. Kuniko, where's Ryozo? He's temporarily in Miyahara-cho. There's a woman he's sweet on. He's with her. Hey, Ryozo, it's me. Oh, Boss. Open up. Ryozo, that was a stupid thing to do while you're on parole. Welcome. Hey, you, go to the bathhouse. If you're going to do something, make it something useful. What's the use in stabbing a hoodlum? I heard you'll be put away for ten years for killing that itinerant. Ryo-chan, we really like you a lot. I wanted you to get away so I had you hide here. But you can't stay here forever. Ryozo... I've staked my life to make Boss the biggest boss not just of Kure, but all of Hiroshima. Don't you want that, too? Yes. We now have connections with the harbor director and our transportation business is growing. But we can't go further while Hiroshi Ishioka is around. Even if I have to die, I'm prepared to kill Ishioka. So I want to take over after I'm dead. Mr. Nozaki, I understand howyou feel. But if you're gone, our books... Ryo-chan's not good with accounting. I'll do it. You will? For sure? Then you'll sacrifice yourself for the Yamatatsu group? Ryozo, I'll take care of you until you die. So make a man out of me. No matter how long you're inside, there'll always be a place foryou with us. Damn you! Boss. Ryozo, shoot me. - Ryozo. - Boss. Ryozo, go ahead... Shoot me. Boss got shot? In Hiroshima? Hiroshi was shot? The shooterwas Ryozo Kano. Yamatatsu group. Kano from Yamatatsu? Kano? Damn you. Yamatatsu! What's all this noise? Mom, Hiroshi was shot. And how is he? He's in Hiroshima hospital with Brother Kawato. Mom, we'll go over there so tell Daimatsu. Masayuki. Yamatatsu Transport Is Yamatatsu here? Where's Yamatatsu? Go ahead, shoot. I'll take a couple of you with me. Masayuki, stop this. Boss was hit by Yamatatsu. What? Brotherwas shot? And why are you here? Yamatatsu's not here. - No reason to let him go. - Hold on. Masayuki, leave... ...for now. I'll make things right. All right. I'll do as you say. Why did you let him go? I like him. Don't forget you owe our boss. Where is he? I need to talk to him. Ryozo's hiding place. I'll take you. It's me, Nozaki. Oh, Nozaki? - You weren't followed? - No. Yamatatsu, you bribed me then you went after Brother. That's so underhanded. What, Daimatsu? How dare you talk to me that way. Boss. Damn you. Even among the yakuza, Daimatsu was feared as the devil's cupid. This was his violent end. Thanks. Ma-chan, thank God you're safe. I'm so glad. I heard Boss was back. Masayuki, we should only go after Boss Yamatatsu. Don't go after Ryozo. If he wanted to, he could have killed me. He didn't fire the fatal shot because of you. One thing is clear. When you prepare to die, it has to be for honor. Don't get into a fight that's not honorable. Hey! Boss Yoshida of Kyushu's acting as arbiter. Boss Yoshida? Also, Daimatsu is dead. He tried to kill Yamatatsu and was riddled with bullets from behind. No matterwho mediates, I'm going to kill Yamatatsu. Masayuki, the arbiter is all powerful. It's a yakuza law to obey his ruling. If you're going to do it, do it before the arbiter gets going. Another thing. One condition is Yamatatsu wants Ryozo Kano cast out from the family. Brother? Cast out? February 1951, Ryozo Kano was sentenced to 21 years for the attempted murder of Ishioka and the previous itinerant murder. Masayuki. Ryozo got 21 years. and 10 months. It's like a death sentence. Masayuki. I don't have any ill will against Ryozo. Boss... Daimatsu was headstrong, but just as I thought, he was an honorable man. Hey, call Mama-san. Yamatatsu, what did you want to talk to me about? That woman's your type. You're staring at her. After the show, we'll invite her to sit with us. Then it's all up to you. Welcome. That girl. Have her come here when she's done. Of course. Please enjoy. By the way, that arm, Ishioka's Daimatsu did that to you? You and Ishioka are in competition. I'm going to get revenge for this arm. If you're a man, you must. Let me help you. What's the matter? Ohara's men were in that car. Ohara's? Looks like they were after the boss. I heard rumors that Ohara is now friendly with Yamatatsu. Yoshiharu, check on that. If we get proof, we'll make the first move. Cabaret Parco Go. It's Ishioka. Get out of here. Yamatatsu Transport Get yourweapons. Two more bullets. We all have to die. I want to put at least one bullet in Yamatatsu. - Right? - Yeah! - Me, too. - Yoshiharu, I want you to be ourwitness. Stop! We'll arrest you for assault and illegal possession of a weapon. Brother, our hands are tied. Yoshiharu. You go. We'll give ourselves up. Take care of the rest. August 25, 1951 Masayuki was sentenced to six years, August 25, 1951 Kiyoshi Kawato received three years Kiyoshi Kawato received three years to be served in Hiroshima Prison. Hello. Aratani Group Tanabe Aratani Group Tanabe It's been a while. Aratani Group Tanabe Oh, you're back. Oh, you're back. You've gained weight, Supervisor. - You, too. - How long are you in for? It's just a year. Just a blink of an eye. I'll be in your care. Boss. It's you, Boss. It IS you. I'm sorry I've not been to see you. So you're Aratani. You've had it. Who do you think you're talking to? Hey, you! If you think you can, try. - Oh, Ma-chan - Hey, Ryo-chan. I heard you'd be coming. If you want to kill me, come any time. Ryo-chan. Boss said he wouldn't hold a grudge against you. - He said that? - Yeah. He and Yamatatsu reconciled with your banishment as a condition. But I swear I'll kill Yamatatsu. Don't forget that. Hey, Ryozo. I put some stuff in foryou. Anything you need, just tell me. Hey, sit. Look, Ryozo... Boss Yoshida who mediated, said Ishioka outranked me. So he said to make things right by ousting you. So I had no choice but to do it. I really am sorry about that. Soon, I'll rule the yakuza world and make it right foryou. Okay? But one of the Ishioka kids tried to kill me and Nozaki. Aratani's in here, right? Ryozo, do you think I really cast you out? You're like my own child. I had to honor the mediator. I did it against my will. I didn't think that I'd be cast out after I put my life on the line foryou. Several days later, Ryozo Kano was transferred to Gifu prison. Ishioka? Ohara Group Monma Dear! Dear! June 26, 1952 Boss? Killed? The guards were talking about it. Who did it? Monma from the Ohara Group. Hey, keep working. Everyone suddenly has urgent things they have to do. They're all phoning in their regrets. I hear Yamatatsu's working them. I didn't think it would come to this. Shimonoseki Elder Kiyoshima Boss Kiyoshima. Boss Kiyoshima's here. Thank you, Boss. What a loss. Nowadays most yakuza are just hoodlums. But Ishioka was a true yakuza. What a waste. Thank you so much. I'll do anything, so please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. Yoshiharu. I can't do a thing since I'm in here. I've let down my boss. Boss. I'll be back soon. September 9, 1952 I know Masayuki Aratani's here. Where is he? Who are you? Aratani's my boss. Tell me. Hey. Stop that! Boss Yamatatsu wants us to kill Aratani soon. - What are you going to do? - I'm aware of that. I'll revenge Boss Ohara. Boss Yamatatsu is more fearful of Aratani inside than the remnants of the Ishioka group outside. Tell him not to sweat it. After Hiroshi Ishioka's death, the Yamatatsu group grew as a modem yakuza organization. Nobuo Yamatatsu became the sole organizer of the longshoremen of Kure Harbor. Nobuo Yamatatsu In comparison, the young men left the Ishioka group and it was on the verge of dissolving. Is it true you're disbanding the group? Missus! Missus... Pops, you seem to have gotten thinner. What? You, too. Are you ill? Thanks for getting a lawyer for Yoshiharu. I hear he got 14 years. Well, he's one of your men. What about the Ishiokas? How's the old lady? Uh, yeah. She's fine. I know that Yamatatsus becoming more powerful. You be careful, Pops. I'm not a yakuza. Don't worry. I can't do a thing until I'm out of here. - Pops... - Masayuki. Take care of yourself and get out as soon as you can. Masayuki. October 5, 1954 I'm sorry, Boss. No, I killed Pops. Boss. I killed him because I'm a yakuza. Masayuki, who was transferred to Okayama prison, finished his sentence and was released in 1959. - Brother. - Boss. Brother, I'm sorry we couldn't stop it. No matter how many men Yamatatsu sends, I'll protect you. Welcome back. - Brother told us to come. - I see. Ryo-chan sent you. Kano Group Kameishi The Yamatatsu group is astonishing. Kano Group Kameishi Kano Group Kameishi They have a monopoly on Kure's public works. They have a monopoly on Kure's public works. They've expanded into Hiroshima and is one of the top construction groups there. Kano Group Takiuchi They have offices in Nagoya and Osaka.

Boss Yamatatsu is waiting for our boss to get out. Yamatatsu is waiting for Ryo-chan? Boss... I promise I'll get revenge foryou. Masayuki... Matriarch. Masayuki. Masayuki. Matriarch. Masayuki? The Ishioka family ends with one generation. You must not get revenge for Hiroshi. Matriarch, what are you saying? Masayuki... I can't do that. I won't be able to face Boss. Listen to me. What happened after Hiroshi was killed? Just more killing. Nowyou and the young men are trying to kill from duty. I say enough. Matriarch, let me do what I want. Gi-ichi, I did something irreparable. Forgive me. Forgive me. Pops. Masayuki. Go straight and marry Michiyo. Michiyo loves you. I can't make Michiyo a yakuza's wife. Masayuki... Please go straight. Ma-chan... Matriarch... Be well. - Masayuki. - Ma-chan. Ma-chan, take this. I made some rice balls. Eat them on the train. Thank you. And it's not much but I hope it helps. Mom, take care of yourself. You, too. Masayuki and the others who wanted to get Yamatatsu, went on a fundraising trip. Juso, Osaka Boss, Deguchi Group Deguchi Boss, Deguchi Group Deguchi When you first came here with Boss Ishioka Boss, Deguchi Group Deguchi you were just a young kid. you were just a young kid. I was sixteen then. That's right. I was surprised by your gamesmanship. I knew you'd be a great gambler and asked Ishioka if I could have you. I'm sorry about Boss Ishioka and yourfather. If there's anything I can do, let me know. You came at a good time. There's going to be gathering at Arima spa. Major gamblers from all of Japan will be present. Will you go as my representative? Yes. Boss, Sugata Group Takeo Sugata The hand is set. Place your bets. Can we match your bet? Please. Matching Mr. Deguchi. Are you done? Yes. Open. Another hand. The hand is set. Place your bets. Boss? Are you done? Yes. Open. Sugata Group Amao Matriarch... I'll get the doctor. Michiyo. Don't tell Masayuki. Brother... I'm thinking of going back to Aga with Shohei. To Aga? I want to knowwhat Yamatatsu's doing. I also heard old Mrs. Ishioka is not well. That's right. What's the matter? A bad mannered gambler's causing trouble. Fifty. Please show me the money. Don't you trust me? Don't you see this badge? Boss, that's the Sugata group's badge. Sir, come with me. What? All right. I'll go with you. What do you want? Could you please leave peacefully? Idiot. You insulted my family. I can't leave quietly. Do it. Kill me. Tie him up. They're coming. Brother. Hey, how dare you hurt my man. I'm Masayuki Aratani. Boss Deguchi is my honorary boss. Youryoung man was bad mannered, so I had him come outside to caution him. He flashed his Sugata group badge and talked big. So as a yakuza, I took care of him. - How dare you. - Keep quiet. You're in Boss' presence. You are right. I'm embarrassed to have such an underling. Let me apologize to you. I sawyourwonderful gamesmanship at the Arima gambling event. I se.. Get some tea. If you're staying with Boss Deguchi, will you consider coming to us? I want you to teach my young men the manners of a true yakuza. How about it? Will you join my family? Excuse me. I appreciate your offer. But I have a job to do in Kure. I know. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know. I'll help you. Thank you. Yamatatsu consolidated Kure harbor business, created a mutual prosperity association (Kyoei Kai) and became the president. But he was worried that his junior boss Nozaki was becoming too powerful. President, he's here. Hey, welcome. You guys leave us. I hear Ryozo's being released. His sentence's been reduced from 21 years to 9 because of the peace treaty pardon. He's very lucky. You said you wanted to talk to me? Oh, about that. I'm thinking of creating a position in Kure for Ryozo to return to. - In Kure? - That's right. We promised Ryo-chan. I owe my success to Ryozo. I thought you cast out Brother. That was beyond my control. At that time, Ishioka was too powerful. I really feel sorry for Ryozo. But it's different now. As the president of the Kyoei Kai, if I say that Ryozo's reinstated, no one's going to complain. I challenge anyone who will. However... Nozaki's getting powerful and he has the nerve to lecture me. Me! - I've heard. - That's right. He's not happy about Ryo-chan, right? I told Nozaki about Ryozo's new position. He wasn't pleased. I'm really mad. Kameishi. Don't you want your brotheryakuza to have an important place here in Kure? Yes. It's for Brother who's coming out. - I'll kill Nozaki. - I'll help. Brother, let me die with you. Takiuchi Takiuchi, at least go welcome Brother. If neither of us are there, Brotherwill be sad. Brother... Let's go to your bar. Which way? VP Kyoei Kai Ikenoue VP Kyoei Kai Ikenoue The dispute spread, hurting innocent bystanders and VP Kyoei Kai Ikenoue becoming a kill or be killed struggle like wild animals. becoming a kill or be killed struggle like wild animals. President, Kyoyu Kai Morikawa Brother, you must be so angry. I'll get revenge foryou. Right, Brother? Uncle, all we wanted was for Boss coming out after his long term to have a place to go. I know how you feel. All you wanted was to do good for Ryo-chan. You really believe that, but they're using your good will. What do you mean? Yamatatsu can't control Nozaki. So he used Ryo-chan coming out of jail to trick you guys. Then Brother Kameishi died because of that? That's right. Yamatatsu used you and he's trying to use Ryo-chan again. Damn him. That dirt bag. Ryo-chan and my common enemy... that's Yamatatsu. On October 7, 1969, Yamatatsu finally succeeded in killing Nozaki in the middle of Kure's shopping district by pumping five slugs from a Colt.45 into him. After Nozaki's death, what Yamatatsu feared most Was Ryozo's release from prison. And in September of 1970 on the day of his release, many hit men were waiting near the prison. They were under orders from Yamatatsu who feared Ryozo and Masayuki joining forces. But Masayuki who knew of this beforehand, negotiated with the prison and had Takiuchi go as decoy to the prison gate while he took Ryozo out by the back gate and succeeded in getting him away. Ryo-chan, I have everything ready. I rented a house, so let's discuss it there. Boss, Boss Kiyoshima is here to see you. Old man Kiyoshima? Put him through. Please come in. Nice to see you again. I went to Aga on Ishioka's death anniversary. The matriarch was worried. Aratani... Kano... Would you consider giving me a dying present? If you act, all the men who followyou will die. Elder, with due respect... Right, Ma-chan? Kano, I understand howyou feel. Aratani, I knowyou want to avenge your boss and yourfather. But could you give this old man one last hurrah? How about it, Aratani? Elder... I'll do what you say. Brother. You... - I... I'll leave Kure. - Brother! Kano, you? I refuse. I won't agree. Then it can't be helped. You'll have to kill me first. I'll go straight... Thank you both. Boss Kiyoshima returned to Hiroshima and asked for a meeting with Yamatatsu. Mr. Yamatatsu, why don't you retire? VP Kyoei Kai Kikuchi VP Kyoei Kai Kikuchi You! How dare you. VP Kyoei Kai Kikuchi The boss came here to talk. Chairman Kyoei Kai Tomoda The boss came here to talk. Chairman Kyoei Kai Tomoda Shut up and listen. That's the best way to bring peace to Hiroshima. Kano will go straight. Aratani will leave Kure. The two with good prospects swore to me. Mr. Yamatatsu, how about it? Elder, thank you. I'll retire with pleasure. Mr. Yamatatsu... Boss... Kyoei Kai Kikuchi Group Asuka Chairman Tomoda was also a man who didn't want dishonorable disputes. This is how the most feared battle in the event of Kano's release was avoided. Boss. - Matriarch... - Ma-chan. Oh, Masayuki. Matriarch. I met with the Hiroshima boss... You did? I've given up on killing my enemy. I'll apologize to Boss and Pops when I get there. Masayuki Well said. You've become a wise man. I made my three sons yakuza. They all had unfortunate lives. Fukuo had his company ruined by Yamatatsu. Shoji was driven out by Yamatatsu. And Hiroshi died before me. He was killed. As a mother of yakuza there wasn't a single day I wasn't worried. If they went out, I always wondered if they'd come home safely. I always worried about them. But as the matriarch, I couldn't show it. That's what yakuza parents are like. All that remain are unhappy memories. Matriarch. Masayuki. I don't want Michiyo to go through what I did. Take care of her. Someday, can I come to you? - I... - I'm coming. I promise. I'm sorry I'm late. Please. Relax. Boss insisted I call you. Apologies. Actually, I was the one who wanted to see you. I'm thinking of leaving Hiroshima and settling in Osaka. Bring the food. I see. I applaud you. I understand, even if others don't. This will bring peace to Hiroshima. Thank you. Excuse me. Boss Deguchi wants you to take over his group. I'll help. I'm grateful, but I have men coming with me. I'm sorry I can't do as you wish. I see. All right. But we can pledge to be brotheryakuza? Brothers... with you? We've know each other for a long time. You think that much of me? Boss likes you. Mr. Sugata. It's me who wants to ask. Please let me pledge to be your underling. Masayuki moved his residence to Osaka's Kuromon market. Michiyo, after Riki's death had moved in and many of Aratani's men also were regulars there. Yoshiharu Sugimoto who was released in 1969 was one of them. How's Ryo-chan doing? I hear he's opening a supermarket. A supermarket? That's so out of his expertise. Mr. Takebu is taking charge of the group. Kyoei Kai is run by second president Katori, but he's in ill health, so there's some dispute about the succession. Vice president Kikuchi quit because he disagreed. What about Mr. Tomoda? He's doing well. He's doing a good job, so he'll probably be the third president. I see. Saijo, Osaka November, 1970 Go. Four days before his initiation as Kyoei Kai's third president, eight bullets were fired into Tomoda's car. One man died instantly. Tomoda was hit in the chest and was sent to the hospital in critical condition. Uncle. When I sensed Boss' feelings, I couldn't help but attack Tomoda. Please understand. The deed is done, Shima. Tomoda won't back down. Uncle. I'm sorry. How's Tomoda? I went to the hospital but no visitors allowed. They will only tell me he's critical. I left Yoshiharu there with instructions to report. - Oh... - Welcome. You must have your hands full with all the young men from Aga. I like it because it keeps me busy. Please call if you need something. Ma-chan. It was Kikuchi's men who left Kyoei Kai that attacked Tomoda. Onomichi's Kyoyu Kai helped. Kyoyu Kai is Boss Morikawa. Why would Morikawa do that? Morikawa and Kikuchi who left Kyoei Kai are brother yakuza. I've been hearing Tomoda and Kikuchi didn't get along. So Morikawa honored that relationship. I have an obligation to Tomoda. I can't let this be. Ryo-chan. I thought we both left Hiroshima so that no more killings would happen there. Isn't there a way to talk this out? But ifTomoda dies, that won't happen. I have to return to Hiroshima. There's the initiation ceremony. Major bosses from around Japan are coming. You'll die. For a yakuza, this is a once in a lifetime event. - I have to go. - You can't. I forbid it. It's Sugimoto. Can I talk to Boss? Oh, Boss? Boss Tomoda is leaving the hospital to attend his initiation. The doctor's saying he won't be responsible. I see. All right, I'm going to Hiroshima right away. The opposition might attack. You people guard Tomoda secretly. I'm coming with you. No, you've gone straight. So leave this to me. All right. But use my successorTakeuchi. Kyoei Kai put all its resources into insuring this initiation would be a safe one. It's an auspicious occasion. We don't have any weapons on us. If you wish, kill me. But if you fire a weapon at this ceremony you'll be the laughing stock of all yakuza. If that's okay, then kill us. We're leaving. This initiation would go down in yakuza history. With Tomoda succeeding as the third boss, this was the beginning of retribution against Kikuchi and Kyoyu Kai. Onomichi Please let President Morikawa know Aratani wants to see him. Hold on. You're on Kyoei Kai's side. I can't let you see him. Leave. If the president personally says he won't see me, I'll consider it. But I can't leave just because you say so. What? Stop it. I'm Morikawa. I'm sorry about this. Please come in. Mr. Aratani. I admired what you and Kano did to avoid bloodshed in Kure. I'm an equal brother with Kikuchi who left Kyoei Kai. So I had to act on that obligation. I have no personal grudge against Mr. Tomoda. The struggle in Hiroshima is not just butting heads. If a gun goes off, someone dies or is critically wounded. I'm prepared to die... along with my men. President. I'm no longer part of the Kure scene. I've returned because I couldn't stand the thought of bloodshed. President, isn't there a way to patch things up? Shima, what do you think? We'll do as you say, Uncle. Mr. Aratani. Since we instigated it, please handle this as you see fit. President. Thank you. Since you were the one who was shot, it's natural you hold a grudge. Yakuza don't need a reason. However, Hiroshima is finally united and is on the road to peaceful co-existence. But depending on your actions dozens of people will die. Will you be tolerant and try to negotiate a reconciliation? Hey. How dare you insult our boss. You know he can't agree to that. Shut up. Mr. Aratani. Thanks for coming all this way. I'll leave everything up to you. Mr. Tomoda. When I was hit in Osaka, and at the initiation, I knowyou worked behind the scenes for me. Masayuki had laid down his life for this reconciliation. The struggle that had continued for 19 months was settled at a Summit in Arima with unification under Tomoda and Kyoei Kai and the oath that Hiroshima yakuza would never again act like animals. In fact there hasn't been a yakuza incident in Hiroshima since then. This was the greatest condolence for the young men who died in the struggle. Aratani, I'm happy to have you as a brother. You did well in Hiroshima. - I'm really proud. - Thank you. Look. Aratani, won't you become the junior boss? That's what the boss wants. Brother. It's an honor too great for me. But I'm satisfied working under you. Please tell Boss that I was happy with the offer. You... Here. Come here, girlie. September 1975, in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka underlings of Asai and Kawana groups, both sub groups of the Sugata family, came to blows. Boss Kawana, dissatisfied with Boss Sugata's ruling which he deemed one-sided, refused to attend group meetings and didn't appear in Osaka for a while. Brother, Kawana is one of the most trusted and reliable men in our group. He's just behaving like a spoiled child. Why don't you leave him be for a while? All right. Masayuki then took his wife Michiyo for a much deserved vacation. This is the first time we're alone together. I guess that's true. But while he was gone, the situation within the Sugata group changed dramatically. What? Kawana's now allied with the main branch? Boss, first I just thought it was a rumor but Kawana seems to be working the ropes. We have to make an example of him. He needs my recommendation to become a direct affiliate of the main branch. Why doesn't he come to me? Instead, he's doing things behind my back. Sugata, indignant, cast out Kawana on January 24, 1976. You have one, too. Yes? Yes, put him through. What? Kawana was killed? All right. I'll be right there. Dear? Kamioka Group Internal conflict is forbidden within the Kamioka group. Sugata must have had his reasons. That's right. We should ask him to explain. But he won't even come to executive meetings. Sugata's actions may cause a rift in the organization. We must act decisively. Junior Boss, Kaimioka group Kawamoto All right. We'll take a vote. Decree of Banishment Takeo Sugata Kamioka Group Executive Committee I received a pronouncement worse than death from the boss. I can't believe it. I don't know why they did this. I haven't done anything to the boss, but no matter what he does, he is my boss. No matter how he treats me I can't go against him. However... I trust eventually he will know how I feel. Until then, we'll go on as is. Think this through and if you wish, go straight. If you wish to go to others, do so. If you stick with me, things will be really tough. So be prepared for that. Boss, you're the only boss for me. No matter what, I'll followyou. Right. We'll followyou. Boss, how can you ask that we go straight? Brother... Don't take that pronouncement too lightly. Everything depends on you. I'll followyou to the grave. Amao, don't leave Brother's side. If something happens, you make sure you die protecting him. Uncle, both Boss and you took good care of me. I'm honored that you let me serve you. I haven't been able to repay your kindness. However, the executives who swore to stick with Sugata sent him resignations. What? You want to resign? Boss, I understand how you feel. That's why I made my decision. There's no way we can live opposing our boss. But no matterwhat we say, Boss won't understand. By leaving you, you'll understand. That's why we made our decision. When you're reinstated, we'd be happy to help you. - Until then... - Shut up. I don't want to hear your excuses. Leave. I don't want to see you ever again. Go. Several days later the police, suspecting there was a mastermind behind Kawana's killing, arrested Aratani on August 31st. Brother... Now I won't be able to do anything for you. Aratani, it was I who cornered you into this. Even if I'm alone, and my bones turn to dust, I won't disband the group. If I do, these won't be a place for you to return to. Isn't that right? Brother... Go straight. Retire and live long. Or you'll just be waiting for someone to kill you. If that's going to happen, go see the boss. See him and tell him howyou feel. Ask what the boss wants as well. You two have a relationship. Because you're all alone now. Aratani... Brother. Sit. Boss... I'm sorry I've been a disappointment to you. You look worn out. Boss, Kamioka Group Kazumasa Tashiro Sit. Tashiro died six months later. Sugata followed soon afterwards. Five years later judgment was handed down on the Kawana killing appeal. Supreme Court Supreme Court We will drop the charges against Masayuki Aratani. We will drop the charges against Masayuki Aratani. Sister. We will send the case back to Nagoya Supreme Court.
