Okay. Okay. ELDERLY MALE NEEDED RETIRED, BETWEEN 80 AND 90 YEARS OLD. INDEPENDENT, DISCRETE AND COMPETENT WITH TECHNOLOGY. I bought the newspaper and saw an ad that said, "Man needed. Between 80 and 90 years old." And I thought, am I crazy, or what? Because it didn't make sense to me. Between 80 and 90 years old? You go somewhere for a job interview, and as soon as you say how old you are, it's over. It's an impediment. They don't like having elderly people. Despite the fact that I look young. I look and I feel young, too. How good are you with technology? - I'm on the internet through WiFi. - Ok. But I don't use it for one simple reason: I think it's unnecessary. It's not working. There it is! - Look, it's not working. - Let me see. See? I'm pressing the button. And I can see you from head to toe. But it doesn't work. One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. You took fifteen pictures of me! The job we've been asked to carry out involves having to bring in a person, an intelligence agent. A mole agent. Right. Mole agent. Could you please explain that to me? - A spy. - Oh, right. A spy. Without anyone knowing that you're a spy. And you're going to be keeping an eye on everything that is going on. Would you have a problem, say, for ethical or moral reasons, that would make you say, "I'm snitching on these old folks"? - None. - None? No, not at all. Even more, I'm interested in it. Do we have your wife's approval so that you can check into a nursing home for three months? My wife left me three beautiful children who are married and have their own kids, but... they're always making sure I'm alright. Would they be against you living in a nursing home for three months? If I get this job, I won't have any trouble, because I'm the one who makes decisions about myself. "Target" is what we call the person who is put under surveillance. You will be given a mission. I'll give you a name, I'll show you a picture, I'll tell you which person you'll have to keep an eye on in there. I was hired by the target's daughter. Okay. So you will be doing the work inside, and I will report back to the daughter who believes that her mother is being mistreated, robbed, and beaten in there. Do you understand? So you're going to be my eyes, you're going to be my ears. Any information is valuable: if you see that the toilets are filthy, or that there isn't any toilet paper, or that the old folks are all walking around in dirty diapers, or that the caretakers are bang! Slap! Or God knows what! You tell me everything. So you have to reassure me that you have this person under surveillance. - You have to be very subtle. - Yes, of course. Without anyone noticing, because if they discover you, that means the job is over. This is the target. Her name is Sonia Perez. Sergio, please try... Try to memorize this lady. - That grandma? - Yes, that grandma. Because you won't have access to any pictures other than these. You are looking at the front of the San Francisco retirement home, in the El Monte district. Alright, now you're going to call me on FaceTime. Alright. I can see you there, sir. But call me. It's no use seeing me, I'm not going to be close to your camera. You have to call me first. Right. Hello, Romulo. I can see you. But you haven't called me. Okay. Answer the call. Slide it. - Which, the green one? - Accept the call. There. Okay. No. Hold it up, hold it up. Look at yourself. - Can you see me? - Yes, I can. - Yes? Am I on the screen? - Yes. - And you're here. - Yes. Look, you're going to call me on the phone to let me know that you've got an urgent "delivery." That's going to be our code. "A delivery." That means you've got - some important information. - Right. QSL QAP. Let's meet at the QTH. Do you understand? Not a thing. Send me a voice message through WhatsApp. Sergio, what are we going to do when you're not right next to me? That's why I'm telling you, focus. Concentrate when I'm explaining something. I'm going to buy you some "Actebral"... For your memory. - What's it called? - "Actebral." This, what is this? A pen. If you look at it with the magnifying glass, at that dot on top. - Do you see it? - Yes. That's the camera. The micro-camera. I'm filming you now. I'm going to turn it around. Now I'm going to turn it off. These are spy glasses. - You turn them on just like the pen. - Okay. - Did it vibrate? - Yes. - Yes. - Did you feel it in your hand? Well, that means you're recording. Right now. Who are you recording? Slowly, not so... No, like this. Pan. Great. That's it. But don't make that spy expression. - Be more... - But you guys know that I'm a spy. - They won't know in there. - Nobody knows. Gentleman, could you take me home? Please, take me out. - Please. - I don't have the key. - My hands are busy. - You, girl, come. Please, help me since the gentleman has his hands tied up. You! You! Her? There's a camera above us. There's a machine up there. Up there. It's for listening to our conversation. Yes, they can hear everything and their ears are covered. I thought they were filming a movie, but not spying on us. Yes, it's like a movie that they're filming. I don't know what it'll turn out to be. Okay, Sergio, Dalal. Look, on the 20th, 21st, you and I are going to take him there. You, as his daughter, and I, for all purposes, and this you have to keep in mind, am your favorite godson. Alright? Any questions? What I'm worried about is that my dad... My mother passed away a few months ago. Not having him around for three months will be hard after losing my mom. Will we be able to see my dad? For how long on weekends? How long can he leave the nursing home for? If the establishment's management allows it and authorizes it under your responsibility, yes. But I can't ignore the rules of the nursing home. Because if every elder wants to go out, well, just imagine. Many of them are going to get lost. And can he have any legal problems if anybody finds out that he's there filming and investigating? Because he will be filming without permission, because you can't just walk into a home and start filming like that. From a legal perspective, the client and I have signed a confidentiality agreement. She can't misuse the information that I'll give her because she's only interested in knowing how her mother is. Dalal, and if you're concerned about the film, we're already filming inside the nursing home, and they know that if a new resident arrives, we'd like to focus on him. In this case, this is your father. Alright? But yes, they don't know he's a spy. Look, for my daughter to be at ease. You see that I go out, we live right by the shopping center. I go the mall, which I know by heart by now, because even with my eyes closed, I'd know where all the stores are. So that also gets boring after a while. Taking a walk, getting some sunshine, looking at the pretty trees, the little birds... It also gets boring. And going back to the apartment... I'm kind of growing desperate. And I find that this has truly been something mentally liberating to me. Mentally tiring, but liberating at the same time, because it's like I'm beginning to feel like the person I used to be. Now, I'm not thinking of your mother all the time, which was happening to me at home. Everything I looked at reminded me of mom. Now I get home so exhausted, so tired, that I walk in and all I want is my bed. So, my mind is starting to get some clarity. I'm happy with this, and I want you to be happy, too, but at ease. Alright? - How are you? - Good, how are you? - Hello, how are you doing? - Good, and you? Fine, thank you. How are you, ma'am? Nice to meet you. As I was telling you, this is the garden. It's beautiful. Here, you can spend time during summer or share the afternoon with your children. These are the railings. Although you might say, "I don't need them," - sometimes we do need them. - Right. So remember that you have the railings to hold onto if you need it. - Sure. - Alright? We've got shared rooms like this one, with two beds and one private bathroom. - Okay. - And we've got single rooms... ...where there is only one bed and a bathroom. With time, you'll get to know the place more. Alright. Please drive safely. - Take care. - I love you. Love you too. - Take care. - I love you. ...and give bread to those who do not have it. Amen. In the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I heard that tomorrow we'll have 40 degrees. That's good. The new man arrived. He's a gentleman. Yes, he looks like... He looks lucid. Did you meet the new man? No. I like him because I think he looks very gentlemanly. Everything I've talked with him about... ...has been great. Really? Did you already talk to him? Yes. This is my dessert. You can have it. Thanks, but I have mine. Why don't we bring him over here? There's room here for two. Until he gets used to being here. If he does get used to it, because some never do and they leave. Maybe he likes being alone. It depends. It makes me sad when they bring people here who can be autonomous in their homes, and they get brought here. But maybe he feels lonely at home. "Good afternoon." How are you? Are you getting used to it? Are you getting used to being here? I can't say anything yet, because today is my second day. But are you from Santiago? From Santiago, the capital. Right. Did you leave your family there? Yes, I did. - Your wife? - I'm a widower. Oh. Do you have any children? Yes. I have a family. - How many children? - Three children, five grandchildren. Wow! - That's a lot! - Yes. Just for me. - What else? - He says he's a widower. The gentleman is a widower. Yes, and since recently, four months ago. Hello? - Sergio. - Yes? - Excuse me. - What? I wanted to ask you something. What's your QTH? I'll get back to you tomorrow, I haven't studied that yet. - You must study... - Okay. So I can ask you in code. - Alright. - Okay? I'll get back to you tomorrow with the answers. Yes, please. At least write them down in your notebook. - Yes, yes. - Alright? QSL... Listen, QSL, QAP. Okay. So you can answer in the same code. - Alright. - Take the picture, too. Okay? Yes. - Good. - Alright. Bye. Hold on, hold on. Someone is coming soon. Lift your arms. Move your arms to the right, To the right! To the right! Which is the right side? Good, to the left! Right. Left. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. One, two, three, without going down. Four, five... Romulo, this is the report for today, Wednesday, I was in the large room, looking around for the target. I had about four candidates, but all ladies look the same to me. What's her name? I don't remember, I don't know. The lady sitting next to you, what's her name? Her name is Clotilde. - Her? - She's Clotilde. I still haven't found anyone named Sonia. Later I talked to Mrs. Petronila. She entertained me with some of her poems. "I'll toast to life: when there's love and comprehension, there's no pain or injury to be felt. Living well gives us a flourishing old age, work and honesty bring joy to mankind, and life ends on the smoothest of terms." Beautiful. You have a great memory, ma'am. Congratulations. She says she's being well taken care of, but she complains that things get lost. The other day, I was wearing a blue shirt, I had written my initials on it. "P.A." with a black pen, right here. - Right. - And the lady that stole it marked her initials on the back with red and blue. In big letters, her initials. Just one time, I lost some money, but it was a stranger, I don't know, maybe a visitor... - But not the workers here. - Just once? Just once. After tea time, I talked to Mrs. Juana, who slipped and fell when she walked out of her room. The result is that her body is sore, and her left eye is purple. I wonder, is this is negligence or not? This mind of mine. This brain betrays me... Let go of it. Let go. Your brain can really betray you, don't you think? Yes. I lived in another world for some time, I didn't know where or who I was. During the afternoon, I was talking to Mrs. Rubira about her personal life and about her stay at the nursing home. I have three children. Two girls and a boy. - Same as me. - Really? Two girls and a boy. The boy is the middle one. Mine is the youngest. He's not so young anymore. He has his own family now. Right. We were very close, but he married a woman that, when I began to get sick and he took care of me, she said to my son: "Don't worry, about your mom, she's fine". Later, I found out that she said "He cares more about his mother than about me." She grew jealous of his mother. That happens all the time. Before I grew old, I did everything for them, for my grandchildren, children, for everyone. And when I started to get sick... Since the old woman wasn't of any use anymore, they had to put her away. But you're doing very well now. You look great. Yes, and I know that your children are coming to see you very soon. Maybe God will hear you. I hope so. - Alright. I'll see you later. - Goodbye. Ok. - Do you want some? - No, thank you. You don't like it? - You have to go over there. - I just had lunch. So then I have to go. At around six o'clock, Zoila and Marta start asking people to open the main door. Oh, the door slammed shut. No, you closed it. Take me home, sir! Landlord! Open up, please! Sir, open up! Please. But how will I leave? How will I leave? I don't know. You, take me to my mother's house. Take me to my mother's house! They fool Marta and make her believe that her mother is calling, but it's really the caregivers. They do this so she can be at ease because nobody visits her. Hello? Hello. It's Marta's mother. Okay. Martita, look, your mom is calling. Talk to her. - Here. - You're so lucky! - Yes. Talk. - Hello? Mommy, I've missed you so much. You never come to visit me. But I'm here. You have to come and get me. Okay. Me more than you. I'm so desperate. I'm desperate because you never come to visit. Romulo. Today I counted 40 women and four men, including myself. And I found the target! She is in Room 17. Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me. - How are you? - Fine. - And lunch, how was it? - Good. And how are you being treated here? - Fine. - Yes? I forgot to ask you your name. Sonia. I arrived here a few days ago. I'm just getting to know people. Asking them their names... ...so I know what to call them. But you're looking great, you're very pretty. A pretty lady. I'll come and visit you every day. Bye. Hello Sergio, I listened to your message and the truth is... since you already know who the target is, don't be so inquisitive. Take it easy, you've already fully identified her. Don't go into her room all the time. Let’s not risk having this lady get the wrong idea and accuse you of something. Who knows... So please, be prudent. Excuse me. Good afternoon, Mrs. Sonia. - Good afternoon. - How are you? - Good. - Good? That's nice. Today feels cooler than yesterday, huh? Yes? Romulo: During the afternoon, I kept a close eye on the target. When teatime came around, the physical therapist helped her walk as part of her therapy. Do you know Mr. Sergio? - Would you like to be introduced? - No. No, alright, no then. When he asked her if she wanted to meet me, she said "No," angrily. She looks at me as if I were the boogeyman. I've realized she's not a sociable person. If nobody talks to her, she can be silent the whole day. That is today's report. Let's pray. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst all women. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen. Sweet dreams and sleep well. I have to take you home. I talk to him. I always talk to him. Oh, that's nice. I look at him as if he were a person. Right. You can talk to him. And does he talk back? - No. - No? He doesn't talk back, but I see him and tell him about me, what's going on in my life. Miss, gentleman. Does this open? And how can you open this? Does this open here? There's no key. The key's inside. Miss, hey... Gentleman, where can I put this? Nope. The bedroom is very, very clean. The shower is running. The water is hot. Water running. There it is. This bathroom.... There's a potty with urine in it. Clothes inside the shower. It stinks like urine. Very dirty. Romulo. Look, I'm looking at the rooms of ladies who are completely bedridden, who don't speak. One of them is unconscious. And the other lady doesn't speak either, she just makes faces, and puts her fingers in her mouth. Honestly, seeing these old ladies is really hard. They're... It's really no way to live a life. It's terrible. This is my room. - It's very nice. - How have you been? I don't know if you've missed me. - I've been in bed for two days. - Yes. They've brought everything to my bed. - That's good. - Thankfully, I've recovered quickly. - They've taken good care of you, then. - Yes, very good. - So don't leave! - No. There's no reason for you to leave, or for you to get depressed. No, not at all. Because if you're feeling sad, you have to search for happiness! - Exactly. Yes, of course. - Stay positive. It happened to me, that's why I'm telling you. Yes, I'm a joyful man. Yes, I'm cheerful. Well, and if I get depressed... I'll just grab my stuff and leave. Oh no! Under no circumstance! That's why I'm telling you, stay positive. Don't worry, it won't happen. I won't get depressed. I'm happy. Yes, I'm happy. You're very comfortable here. - Yes, thank God. - Are you feeling alright? - Yes. - Yes? - It's been how many years... - Do they treat you well? - I've been here for over 25 years. - So you've been taken care of well. Look, since I'm autonomous, thanks to God and to the Virgin Mary, I can still, God willing, get around by myself even at my age. I go to the hospital by myself. I do things all by myself, I go everywhere by myself. - Run errands by myself... - That's a good thing. Yes. I go to the bank. But the way things are now, I've seen so many terrible things on the news - that now I'm afraid to go by myself. - On your own, of course. So I had thought of you, the only other autonomous person who can go out, to help me go across the street for my pension. I would happily do so, but you have to ask permission for me. - Right. - Because I can't just leave. No, of course. I'll talk to the director. And you talked about this with him? Yes, we talked about it, but... I don't know if you're going to authorize... Let me talk to Mr. Sergio, I'll mention it and see if he wants to. - Okay? - Okay. And I like him, you know? - You like Mr. Sergio? - I like him. - And have you told him? - No... Of course not. - I like Mr. Sergio because... - Why? Because he's a gentleman. - He's handsome. - Alright. - He knows how to lead a conversation. - He's really interesting. - Yes. - Alright. And I have the feeling that he likes me too... And if there were a wedding here, it would be spectacular! Of course, Bertita! We have a nice chapel, we have a priest... It would be the first time in the over 25 years I've been here that such an extraordinary thing happened... It's never happened, ever. So you're already thinking about marriage? So this is serious. But why not, if I like him? I've been very picky all my life. Right. But have you've had a boyfriend? I've had boyfriends, but hugs and kisses don't mean a thing. - Nothing serious. - And I've been very stubborn. I would consider giving God my virginity through my future husband. - Is my hair dry already? - Yes, miss. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY Romulo, this is the report from today, Thursday, October 5th. At two o'clock, after lunch, we all went to the big room to celebrate the home's anniversary. It was really nice. First, there was a vegetarian cocktail, which included roasted chicken with salads, juice, and dessert. After that, I was elected king of the nursing home. What do you think of our king, Mirta? He's very nice, first rate. And you, Raquelita? Great. Thank you, thank you. You're a heartbreaker, my king. So I wasn't wrong, isn't that right? I wasn't wrong? No! There's someone looking at me and saying, "I want to say something." Let's go and ask. And Bertita, what do you think of our king? What do you think? I'm in love with him! It looks like there's going to be a wedding! I name you King! Bravo! Let me introduce you to your king, Mr. Sergio. I'm delighted, gentleman. I hope we'll be very happy. Happy, exactly. Bravo! Look, I heard what you sent me about the carnival, about the election of the queen, about you being chosen king. It's all fine, and I'm happy for you. But there's something you haven't sent me. The situations I asked you for, the ones with substance, with details, with solid foundations. That's what I need for the client. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you doing? - I'm good, and you? Fine as well, thank God. - That's good. - That's what matters. I'm glad for you, yes. I go to bed so early. That's good for you. Yes, what else can I do alone? Today I followed the target, and I noticed she has problems standing up. The caretakers must be close by to help her. Oh! The lady, the lady! Sit down. Very good. My little chick. In the main hall, I managed to talk to her, but she only replied the bare minimum. I think she doesn't like to talk to men. Why do you get angry when I touch you? No, because no one can touch me. Oh, and who bought you? I bought you, with my money. Don't fight. Be good friends. Relax. Relax, granny... relax. If my mom show's up, I'm leaving. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not. He loves me... He loves me. That's really great. In spite of my more than 85 years. Yes. Of course. That's wonderful. This is a done deal. For sure, for sure. Hello. You walked right by me, and you didn't say hello. I was distracted... I wanted to talk to you, Mrs... - Mrs... - Miss. - Miss Berta. - Well... Tell me. I won't be coming with you to get your pension. - You won't? - No. The truth is, I'd rather not go out. I used to do it every day, back home. I don't want to go out... ...to the street with you to get your pension. It was a way to get to know each other. But if you're not going to open up to me... But we've already gotten to know each other. Yes, but... - Yes. I even know your room. - My bedroom. - And what do you think of it? - It's pretty. Yes, pretty, and it has a nice view of the square. Of the square, yes. You're in a five-star room. Yes... And about myself, what do you think about me? - Excuse me? - Myself. Well, you're nice. Thank you. Perhaps I'm fooling myself with false illusions... - Let's speak frankly. - Yes. If you're not interested... It's not that I don't want to be with you, I don't want to be with anyone. I'm still grieving, ma'am. My wife is still here, and here. I'm still grieving, I don't need to go out with anyone. Sure, you know what? The problem was that, I said to myself: "Here's a man who's very courteous, who..." Who could, in my head, who could possibly keep me company... But on the contrary, if it's not possible, I'll just be by myself... don't worry about it. I'll go everywhere by myself, just like I've done until now. Thank you ma'am, thank you. For as long as God wants me to be in good health... I'd rather be alone than in bad company. In the life the Lord has set out for me, if there is a stumbling block, I'll push the stumbling block to the side and carry on with my normal life. Love, love, love... - Hello? - Hello. Yes? - Sergio? - Speaking. Let me get to the point. You sent me a lot of videos, but in some you didn't record a thing, because the client is reporting a robbery that took place at the retirement home. Specifically, a theft. So... - Okay. - Please. - Okay. - I expect the report at 8 o'clock. Fine. - Alright? - Yes. - Good luck. - You too, bye. They like playing around. Yes, of course. Not me. I say "no," and that's that. - Of course. - Where is the money? - Not here? - No. - Or here? No. - No. - Or here? No. - Or here? - Nothing, nothing. - Nothing. - Nothing... Well, you screwed up. - There's nothing? - You took my candy. The candy, yes. You've got fast hands. Alright, keep it. I'll eat this one. - Okay. - Eat that one. Mom, you know... I love you too, and I'm trying to get this man to give me the money. Yes, I don't have a dime. Wait, hold on a second. Is her mother alive? Hey, is her mother alive? - Give me the money. - What money? The money I just handed you. - Anyone can lose money. Anyone. - Yes, of course. Go and get the police. THIS ISN'T ELSITA'S, IT'S PETITA'S Romulo, last Wednesday I started following Marta because she seemed suspicious. My things... Oh, these are mine. One, two and... And this one, look. And this one... I investigated Marta's room and found several objects that belong to other people. Marta is very quick at taking things and making them disappear, but it's hard to get angry at her. I haven't seen any nurses stealing. This is today's "delivery." You sent me a photo of a silver necklace. It's a choker. A choker with a stone. I wrote you earlier that the client told me that it belongs to the target? You wrote to me about... ...about a necklace with a medallion, and this is a choker with a small pendant. A stone. I don't know if it's a stone or not. I saw the photo and it's a stone. Then it must be a stone. So now we've caught Marta. A rat who sneaks into other people's rooms, she's earned the title of thief. Mr. Sergio. Mr. Sergio, have you seen my things? I had a schoolbag with my books. - Where? - Here. But I haven't seen it. - You haven't? - No. I had that, I had my schoolbag, my textbooks, everything. Okay. My mom told me, "Take care of your things." And so I did, I took care of them. - Right. So where are they now? - I don't know. - You didn't take very good care of them. - No. - Maybe you left them outside. - Maybe. Too bad. Those things are expensive. When I arrived here, you were the first person I had the pleasure of speaking to. And after that, we've spoken about four or five more times. - Yes. - Of course. And you... And was I speaking coherently? Perhaps I was speaking nonsense. Completely. No, no ma'am. No... Completely coherent. Although sometimes, you have difficulties remembering. But you weren't incoherent, at all. And, in fact, I must say that I don't remember talking to you like we're talking now. You see? Every time we talk, I've asked you if your family has visited you, and you never know, if they have or haven't. You always say, "To be honest, I don't remember." I think that perhaps they do care about you. And just like you've talked to me about five times, and you don't remember, it's quite possible you don't remember that your children have come to see you. Good afternoon, girls. - Good afternoon. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Good, darling. - You look good! - Hey! There's a visitor here to see you. This visitor... we know him already. The godfather! - Sir. - How's Marta doing? Not well. Not well? What happened? Marta, what happened to you? I lost my coat. - She lost her coat. - I lost it yesterday. Darn! And how? Where? When? Why? I left it on top of the table, right? - I guess. - And then I went somewhere. And then it wasn't there anymore. She was carrying the coat around, and I told her, "Put it away." She didn't listen, and she lost it. - What color was the coat? - Beige. Beige with yellow hairs. Well, I... I had a meeting with the client... - Can I ask you a question? - Go ahead. Your client... she's apparently very concerned for her mother. She tells you that she's worried, that she wants me to do a good job... But I've never seen her. I think she's never come to visit her mother. So where's the concern there? The thing is, she works a lot during the week, so you haven't run into each other. - That's the thing. - Okay. So, she urgently requested that you take note of her medicine. She has to take a pill called Ketia... ...dianina. Keta, kietada... What? The names are difficult, you should write them down. Ke - tia Ke - tia dianina. Right. Romulo. Today, I kept close watch on the target. I was watching her at 6 o'clock, and she wasn't given the Ketiapina. Hey, I think Mrs... what's the name of the lady next door? Mrs... - Sonia? - Yes. She has to take her medication. I asked a nurse, she told me the target doesn't take any medication at that time. No, she doesn't take it at six. - She doesn't take it at six? - No. No, she doesn't take it at six. - I thought she had to take it at six. - No, she doesn't. You've got to be tactful and prudent. When you see that it's 6 o'clock and she's not getting her medication, you just tell me, "She didn't get her medication." But don't go and say, "Why didn't you give her the medicine?" She's going to say, "It's not your business whether I give her the medicine or not. On what account?" So you've got to be prudent, you can't start an argument. Who told you that I had an argument with the nurse? - No, no one has told me. You... - You assumed. You assumed. No, the nurse just said she didn't take her medicine at that time. - That's all. - Okay. I guess you asked her, "Why haven't you given her the medicine?" No. Don't imagine things you haven't heard. You know what? Someone told me something. Yes. That you got lost last night. - Last night? No. - Yes. Yesterday. - And that you went outside. - Huh? - That you went out onto the street. - Really? Yes. And that the police took you away. - Yes? - Yes. Is it true? - Yes. - And what happened? - I got lost. - You got lost? Oh. Okay. I'm going to take this so it doesn't go to waste. Oh, you got some on your chest. - Lower, lower. - There? There. Alright. You better wipe yourself, do you have a napkin? Okay... Oh! Sit up. You've got to sit up. - Alright! See you later. - Yes, but wipe yourself with a napkin. - Where is it? - Here... Hand it to me. Alright? There, and there. Take it. Thank you. - Martita. - I don't remember why I escaped. The police came, they arrested me, they asked me my name, my... My worth, all my information. Did you go to the police looking for your mother? I don't know why I went there. What we should do is call the police, and ask why they arrested me. Maybe you did something? No, I'm not a thief, no. I don't have any stolen things. - Nothing at all? - No. Hello? Mommy? Why haven't you come to get me? But if I was bad, you and her should have come. You should have come to see me. And ask questions. Ask questions. That's the most sensitive thing. Of course. Just imagine. It doesn't look like you miss me. Because if you did miss me, you would come and get me. No matter how. I really like your verses, do you know why? Because they rhyme well. Yes. There are verses that I don't really like because they don't rhyme. I like everything that rhymes. - If it doesn’t rhyme, I don't like it. - It's not worth it. This is more for the youth and for mothers. So then it's for me. If it’s for the youth, then it's for me. No, it's not for you. - Is your mother still around? - No. You see? Neither my mother nor my father are alive. I'm going to say it for both of us. "If your mother is still alive, thank the Lord who loves you so much, for not every mortal can boast such big joy or holy pleasure. But if she's gone to heaven, a mother's grave is such a holy place, that there's no holier place to one's heart. When your soul is pierced by a cruel thorn go there to spread your sad tears." I liked it very much. Yes, because who else can recite poetry to us around here? Nobody, not a person. Especially not my husband. I had four children, leaving all my joy for my old age, but here I am, and there's not that much joy. All four of them, I raised them, and what? They're quite ungrateful. They're not the kind who come around every Sunday. But I don't reproach them because to each his own. Because they have their obligations, they have other commitments. They're already married, they have other families. They can't just think about their mother. So I don't reproach them. If they don't come, they don't come. Life is cruel, after all. Hello Ms. Rubira. - Hello. - How are you? I'm not feeling too well because I'm dizzy. Really, you're dizzy? Why? Maybe you took some medication? I guess they gave me medication since I haven't been feeling well lately. - You don't feel well right now? - No. I feel dizzy. But... Has the nurse seen you? No, because this hadn't happened to me before. It's so strange, what's happening to me now. If you want, we can go see her so she can tell us what you have. No, she has to come, because if I walk over there, I could fall. But I can help you. What I feel now is anguish. You got scared. That's what happened. I don't know where I am. You're here at the home, at the San Francisco Nursing Home. If you feel like crying, just cry. - Really? - Of course. You'll feel more relieved. Yes... Don't worry about me. Go ahead and cry. Because it's a way to vent your emotions. Cry. Cry. That will make you feel better. Just cry. That will calm you down. Romulo, I went to see Maria at the front desk and asked to look at the visitor's book, and I discovered that my friend Rubira hasn't had any visitors at all this year. I want to ask you, if it's possible, to use your contacts to get photographs of her relatives so I can show them to her. She'd like that very much. And I'm worried about her mental state. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Daddy, Happy birthday to you. You have to be happy, dad! Right? Yes... And this beauty? Hello. Hello, how are you? How are you? - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? - Very well. - Happy birthday. - Thank you, dear. - Hi, dad. - Hi, son. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. We hadn't called you, because we were coming. HAPPY BIRTHDAY Surprise! - Congratulations! - Thank you very much. Everybody here loves you very much. Thank you very much. Happy Birthday! Thank you for the company you give us. - I love you. - I love you too. Have a great time. Mr. Sergio, since it's your birthday, we have a present for you. But this is more than enough! No, there's still much more. We're just getting started. Since today is your birthday, we present to you Mr. Freddy Torrealba and Patricio Osorio. Applause! Every time I kiss you, I want more Every time I see you, I go crazy Every time, when I look at you, every time It's like discovering... ...the universe I love you I love you And you're the center of my heart I love you I love you Like the earth loves the sun. Who is this person? This is Carmen, my daughter. - No. - No? - Claudia? - No. - Another granddaughter. - Carmen Rubi? - Ana Maria? - There you go! Here's another picture. This is Carmen Rubi. Right, and then? - Claudia. - What a memory! What a memory, Mrs. Rubira! Congratulations. - Very good-looking. - Yes. My daughters were very pretty. And this one is very pretty. You must have been very pretty when you were young, too. - I don't think so. - Yes. You had something to do with it. What do you think of this? - Marvelous. - Isn't it? - It's beautiful, I'm so grateful. - Yes, you're welcome. - Take care of these. - Yes. - In your hands. - Thank you very much. I haven't done anything serious. God knows, he is watching me and knows that I haven't done anything wrong. - They took me just in case. - Okay. I'm sorry, but I couldn't send you anything because I was sick in bed. So I'm very sorry. I'll send you yesterday's report today. But I couldn't do anything yesterday because I went to bed sick. I'll send the report today. My life is so... Because my husband... Forgive me, but I'm a person too! I'm a person and I respect you, so you should too. Okay. Fine. But as I told you, I'll send yesterday's report now. You can't treat me like this. Because... Okay, fine, I'll send you the report. The ambulance is here, prepare everything and bring the cellphone. - Is it coming now? - Yes. Be careful. How long will it take to stabilize her at the hospital? Sometimes they stay in the hospital. She might stay there for a few days. Depending on whether it's a stroke or not. Of course. My hands must admire you I'd like to see you To love like You love To feel like You feel To see the world through your eyes Like I always said, an enviable mind. With her poems, she was the first person to greet our visitors with her poetry. And before dying, as we always do, our residents tell us what they want, when they go to heaven. So, as we sadly say our goodbyes, we also feel happy to pay this tribute to our dear and beloved Petita. "If your mother is still alive, thank the Lord who loves you so much, for not every mortal can boast such big joy or holy pleasure. If your mother is still alive, be good because she who carried you one day continued to suffer and rejoice. She kept watch by night and worked by day. A song from her lips lulled you to sleep. And upon waking, her lips kissed you. But if she's gone to heaven, and you can no longer make her happy on Earth, lay the memories of your flowers on the cold ground that covers her. A mother's grave is such a holy place, that there's no holier place to one's heart. When your soul is pierced by a cruel thorn, go there to cry your sad tears." Shall we go? We can take a taxi, okay? Romulo, I know you asked for hard facts and not opinions. But I'm going to voice my opinions anyway. The residents here feel lonely. They aren't being visited, and some have been abandoned. Loneliness is the worst thing about this place. There's no crime for the client to report to the authorities. Her mother is definitely in good hands. The target needs special care, and we don't know whether the client can provide it. I don't understand the point of doing this investigation. The client should do it herself, she's her mother. She should face her own faults. That's why she can't live with herself or visit her mother. Lastly. When am I leaving? Please reply soon. I want to go back home. Sergio. Hello Sergio. I find your investigation very clear. You have done an excellent job. As for you leaving, hold on just a little bit more to do it as it should be done. I know you are exhausted and that this has stressed you, but give me two days to get you out the proper way. Why are you leaving? Because... If it were my call, honestly, I would love to stay longer. But, as I told you, I have my roots... my kids, my grandkids, I have a one-year-old grandson who melts my heart. So... So, that is why I want to leave, and it's not that I want to, but I must. Thank you for everything. I promise I'll visit. You are my friends. Thank you. You've been very kind to me, so I'm taking a fond memory with me. In my nights, you'll always be there. I love you, too. I loved you ever since I met you. Me too, thank you. - And I'm going to come and visit you. - Alright! My good friend. A friend, and I don't have male friends. - But now you do. - Now I have one. I told you that I am sentimental. Don't make me cry. Everything will be alright, In this life, everything has a solution. Maybe my mom will come... Godfather! -Hi. -You are finally going home.
