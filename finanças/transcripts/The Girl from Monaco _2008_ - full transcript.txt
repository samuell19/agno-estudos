It's great... really great. - Still... if it goes further - and I'd really love to- We're putting ourselves at great risk of a serious relationship. Who knows how far it would take us? Are we ready for such a shock? - We don't have to be serious about it. - But it is. Deadly serious. The first kiss is something huge. To me, what we've just lived is already a fairy tale. Don't pretend you're afraid of me! It has nothing to do with fear. Quite the contrary. Making that moment last gives me incredible pleasure. Give me a chance. Sorry... Why should we get further with it? It's marvellous... We've known each other for 2 hours and time has already stopped. And what will happen next? Let's say I ask you to my room for a drink. Let's say so. Our coming together would look quite ordinary. A good surprise is always possible... but things would probably turn into something quite conformist. Look! Some guy is following us. He's been standing there since we left the bar. - He is a tourist! - Doesn't look like it. What does he want? - Go ask him! - You think so? - Yes? - There's something... Chritophe Abadi. I'm your bodyguard. - My bodyguard? - Yes. - Mr. Lassalle didn't tell you? - No. - Sorry, I should have told you. - I didn't ask for protection. Are you in danger? What have you done? - No, it's nonsense. - Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb. There must be some misunderstanding. I'll phone Mr. Lassalle. Lassalle? The Lassalle case? You're defending him? I heard that he fired all his lawyers. Give me a few seconds. I'll take care of this. No, listen... You have interesting theories but time has not stopped that much. - You won't abandon me here? - I will. Good luck for the trial. - Excuse me but where are you going? - To my hotel. That way! I know! - Good evening! - Good evening! May I?... Excuse me. What are you doing? Securing the area. The usual routine. Excuse me but without interfering with your professional ethics I'm tired and I'll free you now. I'd like you to let me know of your agenda for the day every morning, where you go and the names of the people you are to see. - Christophe... That's your name, right? - Yes. You can secure all the areas you want but I have nothing to let you know of. I don't need a body guard. I'll phone Mr. Lassalle tomorrow. In case of trouble, you ring me. I'm in the next room. Now... wait... You're in the next room? That's on my schedule. Want to check? No... no. I'm here to help you, Mrs. Lassalle. I won't win the case without you. I can defend myself. I've told my son so. Right... Can you tell me how you intend to defend yourself. I don't. Mrs. Lassalle... Let's get acquainted first. We won't go into details. I just need to know what you feel about the events. Have you got a cigarette? No, but I can go get one. Thank you. Your son doesn't bring you cigarettes? He doesn't come often. - Have you got a cigarette? - I only have black tobacco. That will do. Thank you very much. The doctor who examined you said your face was bruised. Dimitri Datchev attacked you before you knifed him. Didn't he? No, I struck first. So? Look, Mr. Lassalle, I'll tell you the truth, it won't be easy. Yeah... I'd told you. My mother can be quite difficult. - She told me she didn't see you much. - She refuses to see me. She must save her. Against herself. The case is complicated. I can't work miracles. Yet... your... reputation. Let's go in the car. Outside we were at risk. You were not threatened, were you? I was. Anonymous letters. Because of that, Roberto does not leave me. You have one too? I meant to tell you... I don't need any one. Listen... you must feel safe. Dimitri Datchev's brothers arrived in Monaco yesterday. You know as well as I that Russians are dangerous. You don't have to follow me in here, do you? I must be no farther than 6 yards. 6 yards? Why 6? That's the rule. Won't you have dinner? Having someone behind you all the time is unpleasant. I understand. Please, come and sit here. It will be better that way. - Won't you order something? - I've got a sandwich. - And where is your sandwich? - In my room. - When will you eat it? - When you're sleeping. Pretend I'm not here. Not easy. The first quality of a S. O. is to remain unnoticed. S. O.? Security Officer. - What are you looking at? - I'm working. Slavs sighted? Slavs or not, if you see anything suspect, tell me about it. I'd like to see the expert's report. It was number 113, right? Yes. Here it is. Wait! I also found this. - What is it? - An Italian porn magazine. Nice of you. But not for me. Dimitri Datchev... was elected stud of the month. It's quite impressive. You think those giant balls will help us build a defense case? May I have a coffee? I'm working for Mr. Beauvois. Bertrand! - What are you doing here? - In Paris, they told me you were here. I couldn't wait. I had to see you. I've left that dumb ass. You did? What's your room number? Could you take my luggage to the room, please? I threw my phone up into his face. Tore up his retina... You didn't! - I did! How is he feeling now? Reserved prognosis. What are you swallowing? Xanax. But I don't want to kill myself now. - That's good news. - I owe it to you. What you told me last time is wonderful. - What did I tell you? - About waiting, love play... - Few men can say those things. - Many do, many. - No, no... - Yes, yes... All with their stupid machismo. And after, nothing. - Uncompromising, aren't you? - Is it wrong? No, that's not it... Only... H?l?ne, be nice... I'd like to talk about your husband. What's the prognosis? You're plumper than I thought. It deteriorated quite suddenly. - You know what? - Yes... - I want oysters, champagne... I want plenty of champagne! Mixing xanax and champagne is crazy! You've got a problem? Not at all. What's the score? 0-0. Is Piccione playing? You pronounce it "Piccione"? - What do you say? - "Piccion" - Is he playing? - Yes. If that woman stays in my room, there will be awful problems. - Tell her to leave. - You don't know her. She won't. Bertrand, come quickly... Can you hear? Can you hear? Frightening! 10 minutes from now, you knock at my door and say I'm asked for. I count on you. Be nice, H?l?ne, that case I'm working on is very difficult In Paris, you came on to me all the same. Yes but here... the stakes are high. You are a clever woman... You are indeed... If you're clever, you must understand... Stop blabbering. Listen to me please... Please, listen! How can I tell... I'm the victim of an incapacitating pathology... We don't care. I'm here for you... - There are phases. You get it? phases... - What phases? When I met you, I was going through a period of intense exaltation. I was available but today... Today I'm racked by doubt. Please, listen, H?l?ne... I fear we'll get into a situation that is quite far from your expectations which seem to be very high. My cycles are very conflicting and not compatible with erotic availability. With what? - Erotic availability. - Erotic? - What are you talking about? - It may not be the right word. Without being indiscreet how did you and your friend part? None of your business. H?l?ne... I think you can still make up with him. He loves you. That's quite sure. Men know how to forgive. Get him on the phone. Tell him you made a mistake. I'll dial the number. Which is it? You must dial zero first. You don't know how much you need him. I know it's not part of the job but you should take care of that woman. - What do you mean? - She's remarkable, you know. - What do you want me to do? She is not well. Keep her from doing something stupid. Tell her I'm really not a man for her. Use your insight. - Right. - You look reassuring to women. I can feel it. - I'm not sure. - Yes, believe me. It's a gift. Can't be explained. Quite unfair actually. I trust you. Go! Go! I'll wait for you in your room. I'll see what I can do. Tomorrow morning, a depression coming from the north will bring rain all day. Heavy clouds will gather above our principality. In a few days, I promise, a softer air will close in on you. Summer will start showing its nose and everything will be much better. Coffee, sir? Yes. Thank you very much. - She's still there? - She's gone. - Where did she go? - To Paris. If I may, I'll use my bathroom. Please do. It wasn't too difficult? - No! - What did you tell her? We didn't speak much. - Can you tell me how... - Very good. What was very good? She only needed solace. And how did you do that? I did what was necessary. - You went to bed with her? - A little That's not what I asked you to do. Sorry if I misunderstood. How did you manage? It happened. It is that simple for you... - I shouldn't have? - Yes, yes. Yes. You were very professional. For you, it's simple, I guess. You see a girl, you like her, you go to bed with her. You find it natural. It's the aim, isn't it? Have you ever wondered why we go to bed. - No. Well, you should. We're told lots of stories. That things will be wonderful. Most of the time it's a disappointment. Yet, it's life. "On the deserted beach... " "all the shellfish,... " "who would have thought so, wish summer were still here. " "But it is over now. " Thanks for your advice, Audrey. See you tomorrow. Defense lawyer Bertrand Beauvois is our guest. We thank him for being here. Can you tell us why you accepted to defend Mrs. Lassalle? I never know why I accept a case but what I can say is that nothing in ?dith Lassalle's life could let us foresee such tragedy. Wait! Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm working. - You two are together. - Hello! - Hello! Your hair looks nice that way. It's your first case in Monaco? - Yes! Welcome on the rock! Shellfish on the beach, not today! Quiet! I'm not given the right cards. I must invent. It's not a real science! I saw you singing "la gadoue". That was great! Thanks! It's pleasant to hear this. No one ever says anything. Right! I'll be on my way! We'll phone, right? Goodbye, sir! Bye! She's fun! She's a girl from here! Typical! Typical? Why? That sort of girl is everywhere! You seem to know each other well! - You had something with her? - Can say that! Are you coming, Sir? Thank you. Do you mind if I stay in the courtroom? - Not at all. - Thank you. I must remind you that he was knifed 17 times. Those photographs say much more than any preferment. According to the coroner, the victim, though seriously wounded, tried to escape his murderer. Don't forget, Your Honors, what's at stake here, in this Court, A man, Dimitri Datchev, knifed to death, a murderer who kept going at her victim with extraordinary violence ...we detailed the autopsy report... What we know is that, after Italy, Dimitri was hired as a waiter at Hotel Mirabeau. How long? It doesn't say. He didn't stay. Afterwards he was washing dishes at the "47". What's the "47"? A night-club. You go there? I worked there at security. You see that space behind the column? We call it the widows' corner. It was Dimitri's hunting ground. He met ?dith Lassalle there. It's appalling! Having to bear that noise at 60! You've seen that woman? You noticed how strange her hairdo is? The anxiety you feel. You feel how lonely she is. She's not unhappy. She's into her thing. That's right. We always lay too much about things. - That Peugeot is yours? - Yeah! Can you move it? I'm not sure I can leave... - You trust me? - Yes. Well... Go! Guess who! I'm "la gadoue" Remember? I recognized your back. What are you doing here? Not chasing girls? Why? I'm too old? Almost. - You always say what you think. - I shouldn't? Yes, yes. It's risky though. - You're Aquarius, aren't you? - Yes. I must be wary of Aquarius. Aren't you thirsty? I am... Yes, I'm thirsty. I'm with friends over there. They'd like to meet you. - Yeah? - Guess who won the shoes' contest? - Fabio! - No, I did! Let me! I'll take off your shirt. - Why? - I'll clean it in the sink. - I'll give it at the hotel. - Why? You're embarrassed? You keep your socks on the beach? - I rarely go to the beach. - Cute! You've got goose pimples. You've got a baby's skin. You should share it! What's going on here? Could you find a shirt, Christophe? A shirt? Imagine what he thought... seeing us there. He thought nothing of it. Why? You don't think it possible, you and I? No answer? Cat got your tongue? Audrey? What are you doing? Hurry! Can you lend your shirt to my friend? I shouldn't have left you. - You see: I survived! - What did she say to you? Crazy things! She's got her own language. - You can say that indeed. - You're harsh. - Do you know how she got that job on tv? - No. She was in a disgusting reality show, "The diva of love". Do you know it? - No. - You can't imagine what she did to win. - You got a light? - I don't smoke. - I know you, don't I? - I don't... Please, Sir! Sir! Move on! Move on! Why did you do that? He is harmless. - He was drunk! - He was too close. - I had to act. - You're impressive when angry. - You scared me! - Not what I meant to do! Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I must say that Mrs. Lassalle is not used to going to that sort of place. She lived away from the world and did not see many people. But she was probably not satisfied by her life. When she gets into the "47" that evening, she is vulnerable and very lonely. Quickly, Mr. Datchev sees her. He looks at her jewels. An organized predator, he plans. The first night, he won't talk about money. He'll even pay for everything. - He is a professional. - Sir! I forbid you to talk that way about the events. - I'll explain. - There's nothing to explain. - You'll stop and that'll be it. - Let me. Fine? Started a long time ago? - Yeah. Counselor... Can you go on? Yes, Your Honor. The very reluctance Mrs. Lassalle shows... You read the papers? Your boss is quite famous! Ah, there you are! Can I see him? - You can't. - Why? - He mustn't be disturbed. - Seems you like your job. - It's o. k. I've still got your blue pull over. I'll give it back to you. It's too nice for me anyway. Good evening. It was extraordinary. Your presence when you plea is mind-blowing. Plead. The way you throw words, the way you speak... When you say "alcoholic", we can hear the glasses tinkling. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. You got a minute? I must tell you of a thing. Very important. You didn't kill anyone? - You swear you won't tell? - Of course. - I swear, Audrey? - I swear, Audrey. - With your hand? - I swear, Audrey. There's no risk. I already submitted my idea, so... You'll understand... - Come! We're going to the sea... - Yeah, cool! Are you coming? ... Come on, do! I must prepare for tomorrow. I've still got plenty to tell you. - It's not too far? - No, it's quite close. - We can go, can't we? - You've got at an appointment at 20:00. Once a week, I must cover an event that occurred in Monaco. Anything. Only a 3 minute subject after the weather but I do what I want. - Do I "pitch" my idea? - Pitch! The celebrities' pets. What do you think of it? The celebrities' pets... Indeed. I sweated blood to say it. Like it? - Not bad! - I was sure of it. We're in sync. Now... If you say pet, you say master. Right or wrong? - Right. - Now, that's where it gets great... I ask someone famous to tell about his cat or dog. I need the celebrities now. Barthez agrees. His parrot imitates a Brazilian commentator and shouts: Goooooal! What I'd like to know is if it's lawful without getting the pet's permission. I'm not a specialist of animals' copyright but I feel... Come! Come, it's ready! It's great here, isn't it? You see those clouds there? Means the mistral will blow all week. You can say it on tv. If it was a tsunami... They'd open the news with my forecast. Come! I know a nice spot. - You want sardines? - No, not when I'm working. Nothing ever happens here anyway. Nothing can be great. And your forecast is important. Whole destinies can change because of a light wind, a light breeze, some rain. You know of Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir? They first met in a caf? That day, there was rain, a fine rain, almost nothing. He said: let's stop here, it's raining. And they remained 40 years together. You realize? One of the most famous couples of the XXth Century started on what? Nothing. A few drops of rain. So nothing can mean everything. You never let go? I was trying to widen the scope. Undress and let's go for a swim. You coming? It's getting late. - I don't like water at all. - Don't go! Water's great! Come on! Undress! It'll do you good. It will sting! That's it. I'll dress it. Strangely enough, I had a good time. Those guys are disarming. Can you try and walk? I feel all right. Want a drink? No thanks. I'm all right. Audrey... I don't know. I can't understand what she is. Do you want a piece? Thank you. There may be nothing to understand. How did you do with her? Simple. What do you mean, simple? Straight to the point. You're not interested in her, are you? Because, except for... - You have a problem with it? - No, no problem. You had a long relationship with her? No. - 6 months, a year? - Much less. Short but intense... Sexually, I mean. No complaint there. Not bad. Coming from you, that's a compliment. Yes. - We'd better not stay. - I told you so. Bertrand! You came! It's cool! Hi! I'll introduce you to my parents. They will be proud. They redecorated. You like? Mum, dad... Bertrand. Very kind of you to come, Sir. Counselor, Mum... Counselor. Pass the video camera. Go all around him. Turn towards Bertrand. Move, Christopher. You're in the picture. Can you smile, Bertrand? Great! Fantastic! We lost him. He'll be mad. That's it! My place! Come in. What will you have? Malibu? Sky? - Sky. - O. k. You like her? A lot. When she died, I had a revelation. When she died, she had everything. I had nothing but I was alive. I started smiling, laughing, pretending I was the most beautiful girl in the world. And they all believed it. Of course. What does it inspire you? You're not your usual self. You say yes, you say no. You talk much more usually. I'm listening to you. When I saw you on tv, it triggered something inside me. I felt tinglings. I believe in meetings. It's in my karma. - Karma! You mean chance? - No, There's no such thing as chance. Since you've been here, everything is cool. Is that chance? I can't believe it. A real watch dog! Let's go, counselor! - What is it, Christophe? - I can't believe it. You plan on staying here? For now, yes. - Is it a problem to you? - I must search the place. This is ridiculous, Christophe. Right? Are you finished? - Raise your arms. - You overdo it a little. Any stranger staying with you must be security checked. - Avoid the palpations. - No, no problem. It's a trick to grope girls. - Go straight at it. - I know it all. You didn't say so once. - It's all right, Sir. - Now go and have fun! I'll be downstairs. Seems a bit fast to me. I don't know why we're waiting. It's fast. I assure you. Really fast. I don't want you to be disappointed. My sexuality is not exceptional. Take me in the ass. Straight out! Christophe. - What time is it? - I don't know. - I fell asleep. - Don't you notice anything? - No. - Look at me. - I can see you. - What just happened is not human. If you knew what she did to me, what she invented all night long. That curved body, shameless, boundless... It never stopped. There's pleasure and nothing else. Incredible! You fucked, no more. Exactly. What I try to make the Court understand, Mrs. Lassalle, is that, before meeting Mr. Datchev, the life you led was perfectly organized. Everything was controlled, planned. You wanted to be protected from the slightest unevenness. from the slightest slip. When he came, everything changed. You lost your head, Mrs. Lassalle. You were confronted to feelings, emotions that, for the first time, you could not control. Something alive was taking you away. You let everything go. You didn't control things any more. What did you do in the hours that followed Mr. Datchev's death? I wanted to go see my daughter living in Paris but I couldn't. Why? As soon he saw the body, my son called the police. I wouldn't have run away. My only regret is not to have seen my daughter. I think you're quite optimistic. Her last sentence left a bad impression. You didn't understand. Something opened today. She looked fragile and everybody saw it. For the first time, I saw I could break her shell. Stop being a killjoy. We're making progress. See you, Alain. Do you know where I could find a sword? Hello, welcome to the pirates' night. It's nice... exotic... tropical. We won't stay long, I promise you. Make an effort, Christophe. Think of Gauguin, of "Treasure island". It's a party to promote industrial punch. How uptight you are. Enjoy! The girls are beautiful! You're fine? Nice necklace! Where's Audrey? Is she with you? For Audrey, see Bouli, he is in charge! Excuse me... Are you Bouli? - Yes. - Do you know where Audrey Is? With the people from tv, over there. Thank you very much. She forgot all about you. She told me to come. I'm sure she'll come. Now, she's working. We're wasting our time here. Why are you such a naysayer? - Did she leave you? - No. - Nothing to be ashamed of!- She's not the kind of girl you leave. It works or it doesn't. Was it long ago? - 2 years. - Quite recent then. Wait, I think she's calling me. That behavior is normal? It's normal. She's a whore. No, it's somewhat extreme, but... I usually have an intuition about women. Here I don't know. She exposes herself. It's crazy. I wonder if you aren't making her run away. Come on, move away. You said 6 yards. There aren't 6 yards. I'm joking, right? We've got to go now. I was looking for you everywhere. I thought you'd left. Come, I'll videotape you. - Lord Nelson has left? - Yes. This is ridiculous. Come on, jump! Please, do it for me. Come on, do it! Come on, do it. Please, do it for me. You're too cute. Then, let's go to bed. Sir... Sir... Can you hear me? Sir... You'll be all right. - Bertrand, are you all right? - Enough bullshit. Get off! I'll put you on your side. Let me do it. That's it! I can't understand a word. Right... Bring a microphone to the defender so that we can hear. It's useless, I've lost my voice. Take this. Making love is not good for you, Sir. You're right, she's impossible. You're strong, you were able to resist. My health is not good enough. I can't. See that yellow one? It's an exoria poseida. It changes color for the love parade. After mating, he can sleep a whole year. He's lucky! - You know a lot about marine life. - I'm from Monaco. Thanks! - It's a nice place. - Yes. - So you were born here? - Yes. The whole family. On the Rock. You've always had so structured a life? No. I also got into trouble. Nothing much. You weren't there to plead. - What happened? - Nothing much at first. A fight outside a night club. I hit the roof quickly at the time. Now you look so quiet. Thanks to my job. Anger management, self control. No alcohol, Krav maga. - Krav what? - Maga. It's Hebrew. It means close combat. What are your usual customers? VIP's, business men, show biz, emirates... It comes and goes. I rarely have real contacts with someone. - Thank you for everything. - I'm only doing my job. It's much more than that. I want you to feel fine tomorrow. - You must win that case. - It's that important to you? Yes, you do something useful. You save people, guilty or not. It's good. Tomorrow, hot lemon, right? Tomorrow, hot lemon, no croissant. The best lays are always the guys who look uptight. I don't believe you. You just want to be nice. And your appeal is an atomic bomb. I'm glad you came. My spirits were not really high. For the pets, it didn't work. Barthez left me down. - He did? - He didn't want to be filmed. His parrot bit me. Bloody rat! I must find another idea. Demis Roussos has got a small bulldog. But they're both in sleep therapy. I feel bad. I don't know what to do. Your lover's there waiting. He is downstairs? Be careful. Soon he will ask you to have sex. You know you must tell me when you go away. She was not feeling well. She's in trouble, you know. With her program: celebrities' pets. What? Celebrities' pets. She was desperate, I feared that she made some mistake. Of course. I could not let her all night with that sort of ideas. Hi there! - I didn't sleep at all. - I had a great idea. Counselor Beauvois, can you tell us who's your favorite criminal? Come on! It's ridiculous. Come on, pussy, if you wanted to, you could save my life. I've already got the title. "In Counselor Beauvois's gown. " What do you think? The idea is to be close to you, no taboo, no double talk because the people don't know counselor Beauvois under the gown. Well, I'm the only one who knows. It would be like "The new star" but more on the legal side. What do you think of it? A lawyer was never interesting to anyone. But Hubert, the announcer, thinks it's great. Look! You're cute there, like a little boy. No one has seen you that way. I have a funny face, haven't I? It's funny. You don't realize... We'll be together all the time. I'll be with you 24/24. Cleaned and ironed. Christophe, room service does that, you know? In the hotel. - There it's perfect. - Why are you looking at me? - I'm not. Move on... Vai, vai. I'll get the car. It's nothing. Only a few minutes. It's funny and it helps her. Trust me. I know when to stop. Don't look at the camera. You have a look of concentration. You're getting to work. Go to your desk. Slowly, sit down slowly. You open your files, you look at them. Being here with you is moving. That's where it happened. Can you film us, please? All you have to do is press here. - You won't? - It's not part of my job. What's your job? Why are you here? Where are your mafiosi? Hell! I am not asking much. - Audrey! - What, Audrey? That moment would look great. Look at the sight. That bastard won't move his ass. You've got a real scoop! You never understood me. You're an asshole. Only college graduates can understand you... It makes you laugh! I'm fed up! You're pissing me off! How long will it go on? - Listen... - Stop telling yourself stories. Today, it's Princess Grace, tomorrow, you'll be in your undies in the aquarium. You go on like this, she'll ruin your case. You calm down, don't speak to me that way. I know what I must do. You'll go on like this, saying yes to everything, like a girl. Don't you understand she won't leave you alone? May I remind you you're paid to watch my front door? If I needed a body guard for advice, I'd know about it. - You've been warned. - What do you think? That I can't do without you? What are you waiting for? Will you drive me to the hotel? Well... I should get cross more often. - They had them in dark red. - No, I love the color. Can you find a cigarette? Of course. I left the car in the parking. - I could not find any, darling. - I took chewing gum. Do you realize what's happening? It's not chance. When I spoke of karma... That's what it is. Since I met you, I've felt orange energy. It's fluid that goes there and up to here. In the book of energies, orange is the rarest color. In some lives, it never appears. It's horrible, isn't it? - There are books on this? - Yes. I like it when you listen to me. There's something we've not tried yet... Yeah! Yeah, it's cool. I'm asking. What's the room number? Come on, there's a surprise. Wait, you haven't seen the present yet. Where is it? What is it? Tell me, excuse me... Where's Audrey? - She didn't tell you? - Tell what? Forget it! You've got a car? Yes. - I hope you didn't make a mess in my place. - You'll thank us all your life. Let's leave them. He's wanted to have her for so long. To have whom? Audrey, he's the only one who didn't have her. It's revolting. Everyone can't have her. You've had her. And it was not even your birthday. Where shall we go? To Nice? The pill of love. Swallow it. You'll feel better. It's not a good idea. You know the "Doux Sud" in Juan? - No. Come on, start! I'll tell you the way. Want me to drive? Counselor... I didn't know you came to that sort of place. Shall I buy you a drink? No, thanks. I wanted to talk to you. You know I'll testify tomorrow. You don't look all right... - Leave me alone. - What's wrong with you? You want me to go get your bodyguard? Leave me alone. I hope that girl is not too much trouble. She's already left you? You're crazy! You're sick! I don't know what they made me swallow in the tunnel. It's forbidden to pedestrians, right? She left me for that fat guy. You know that fat guy? I want to thank you. Thank you very much. Care for a coffee? Yes please. It's very tidy here. - How many square meters? - 32. You lead a lonely life. In my job, you must be available 24/24 You can't have a family. - I don't want to go. - Of course you will. That woman is like a wall. She counts on you. My father had a garage. He was cheated. His lawyer didn't give a damn. He lost everything. I don't know what to do. I rang your assistant. You have testimonies and the coroner report. And Lassalle son. - Ah yes... Shit! - Why? We had an argument yesterday. Don't look at the spelling. Mine can be faulty too sometimes. Not in the same way. You were right. Audrey is terrifying. She is a witch. A modern one at that. Her sexuality is abysmal and she believes in colored fluids. Worst part is that I want to see her. Mr. Louis Lassalle? When Dimitri Datchev was not working for your mother, did you sometimes ask for his help? Sometimes. Can you tell us what jobs he did for you? He would drive me at the doctor's, at parties, at friends, everywhere. Did he go with you in bars, - discos? - Never. It's no secret you go out a lot at night, is it? I even meet you sometimes. Tell me, Mr. Lassalle, you never married? Never. Did you think of it? It didn't happen. You never met the right woman? Or would you say your desires led you onto other paths? I see no reason to answer. Let go of me! Quiet, please! What's with you? I thought you were zen. You know how much concentration is needed in a trial? You don't give a damn. What right have you to say so? You come in... out. You cause bloody chaos. You think his work is easy? What do you know about law? I'll say it calmly... don't come close to him. He won't see you any more. Who says so? You or he? - You go to bed with him? - I know how he feels. He doesn't give a damn about you. When he's gone, you won't exist, you'll go back watching your parkings! Don't come near him. It can't be true... You're in love? Shove off! I won't. Shove off! Dimitri Datchev was hired by your mother. In that intimacy, in that daily threesome, you started having contradictory feelings towards him. You are a clever man. You were aware of that. As the days went by, slowly, you realized the situation was getting dangerous. He was your mother's lover. You were on forbidden grounds. That growing desire finally got the better of you. You could not help it. You did not resist. Mr. Lassalle... Were you Dimitri Datchev's lover? Yes. When did your mother know? The day before. Under what circumstances? I told her. I couldn't bear the idea of his going with her. I told her I would leave with Dimitri. How did she react? She listened, said nothing. She went up to her room. I didn't see her again before... Hello, my love. This is version 1 of my movie. Don't be too harsh. You're my first spectator. Your opinion means a lot. Kisses. "In Bertrand Beauvois's gown" Bertrand Beauvois is a lawyer, dreaded in every Court. Repeat rapers or ruthless thugs, he defends the worst criminals. He found a second home in Monaco. And it has changed him. He is simple, forthright available, everyone can speak to him. The mildness, the fresh air the easy living in our principality won his heart. Counselor Beauvois loves our city, its history, with its pump and its tragedies. In spite of the importance of his work, Bertrand Beauvois knows how to party. He has friends of all ages... When do they show that masterpiece? It's pathetic. I'll ring her. I'll ring her at once. Who else can do it? No one. My parents have closed for us. It's nice, isn't it? They thought you'd want some quiet. Tomorrow is D day. It's nice, but you shouldn't have. - It's from de 'eart - Thank you. Come, let's sit, sweetheart! We'll leave you. Audrey... Listen... Listen... I watched the film. Ah... you found the time? Cool... You liked it? Hubert wants to show it on Sunday. It... No way. You're handsome tonight. Why do you tell me those things? What's going on? Your hands are sweaty. - They're not! - You're sweating! Loook! No, I'm fine. - Audrey... - Drink your champagne! - What do you think of it? - Awful! Last bottle left from our parents' wedding. We opened it for you. To us! - Audrey... - I've thought things over, Bertrand! We can't go on like this. It goes nowhere. It's true. You're right. We're going nowhere. Don't you think? Yes... yes. We feel the same. Good! It's a nice encounter. In 2 days, you'll go back. I can't stand it. Life goes on. What else can we do? It's possible. I can go with you. I can leave everything here. No problem! Family, buddies, weather report. I don't care! What I want is to be with you. Taste this at once. It mustn't wait. It's very good. Oregano, isn't it? I haven't washed my hands for 8 days. Want to know why? To keep your smell. I'd never have thought I could be with someone like you. Know what Diana said? That lack of love is the worst disease in the world. Even in the end when she left Charles, all she cared for was the nobility of the heart. Though she'd lost everything, her money, her way of life. Even her dogs. Please... You can't imagine being with a girl like me... Can you? I wouldn't blame you. I know where I come from. But don't tell me now. I think I love you. I won't go. Ring Alain. He'll replace me. You can't do that. I can't plead. But you're going to win. I'm exhausted. I... I... I can't fight. I'm going into pieces. - I can stop her getting into the Court room. - That's not the problem. She wants to come and live in Paris with me. She's planning her moving away, her first baby's birth. Do you love her? I don't know. She's there, she invades me, she is my obsession. Damn, it's hell. You can't go on like this. You won't let that girl destroy you. You need to have balls. Balls! Always balls! I won't always be there to help. Without you, I wouldn't be in such a mess. Without me? You told me she was a sexual prodigy, that she was a bomb. That I had to be simple. All the bullshit! You're tired. You were supposed to protect me. See how you did it. Are you proud? What do you propose? Find some idea. Oh, My God! Do something. I don't want to see her any more! Hello, my sweet. Let's make peace. You should have worn your blue shirt. It "flashed" more with your eyes. A fresh pineapple juice, please! With croissant and toast with honey and marmalade. Thanks. Stop drinking coffee! It will stress you! It's decaff. Don't worry. It will work. I'll send you positive waves. Shit! My movie camera! I forgot it in my scooter at Bouli's. Hell! I won't have you pleading. You can't shoot in the Court Room. - Go! I'll come later. - I can take her. True? Yes, I can go on my own. Keep the car. Mine is close. We'll see you later. - Take your time. - See you, sweetheart. It's starting to rain. I had told so in my bulletin. I was right. What's wrong? You quarreled? No. Not because of me? May I put some music on? I love that song. It brings back good memories. - Not to you? - No, not to me. - You're a sexy driver. - Stop it! Come on! You want it too! Remember your fit in front of my door? You woke up the whole building. What a laugh! So funny! Why are we stopping here? What's that look? What do you want? Say it... We can talk too. That's not what you really want. Listen! I know it's silly. We'll be sorry afterwards. Say one word and I'll stop. Shall I stop? My scooter! Shit! Damaged! Are you going to help me? What are you waiting for? Hurry! I'm fine. Don't worry! We never did anything, right? Forget it! Let's hurry! What about lunch in San Remo? Are you crazy? You want to have lunch! - Bertrand must be waiting for me. - He is not! - He never will. - What are you saying? It's over. You thought it was serious? You don't get it, do you? We'll get married. We'll live together in Paris. I'll meet his friends. I won't let that chance pass by. You want to spend your life as a guard at the casino, that's your problem. I'm not ashamed. Yes I will succeed. I didn't work my ass off for nothing. I will be a star. What sort of star? Poor guy! I really feel sorry for you at times! Tomorrow I'll take the plane with him. For you, it's over! Contract ended! If you could see your face! Since that trial started, Mrs. Lassalle has betrayed no feeling she seems very far from here It looks like she did everything to prevent us to understand her secrets. That mask impressed us all a lot. She chose to entrench inside herself. Yet should we conclude from her attitude that she feels neither pain nor remorse. nor hope of forgiveness. What does not express itself teaches us about ourselves and about life... I assure you it puzzles me... I looked at the jury, especially the women. They were deeply moved. Congratulations, Counselor. It was great. Congratulations! Can I have a cigarette? You're the last Gitanes smoker. I do as my father did. What did you think of my pleading? Wonderful! Thank you. Her not being there helped me a lot. Would you mind if I didn't wait with you? No. Something wrong? I'm fine. You look tired. You should take a holiday. But... where is she? She won't bother you any more. Are you coming, Counselor? My daughter says she'll get the minimum. Here you are, Sir! - Was your stay here nice? - Perfect! - Did someone ask for me? - No, Sir. What time shall I ask the taxi to come? I'll tell you. Counselor? Inspector Taurand. Can I talk to you? How did it happen? Well... that's why I asked you to come with me. It is not a traffic accident. What do you mean? Miss Varela's scooter was hit by another vehicle. We have every reason to think that your protection agent, Mr. Abadi is responsible for that collision. We are questioning him. But he refuses to answer. There's paint on the victim's scooter. It matches with that of the rented Volvo Mr. Abadi drove every day. We are sure there was a collision involving the 2 vehicles. Excuse me... Can I get a drink of water? Of course! We've got to determine what happened. You understand how important your testimony is. We don't know yet if it was a crime or a hit and run traffic accident. Sir? Mr. Abadi has nothing to do with Miss Varela's death. I've kept the car the whole morning. I was driving. No one is responsible but me. Mr. Abadi, you can go home. Don't worry, Christophe. I secured the area. 1 year later... 1, 2 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. and 6. Turn round. 1... 2, faster! 3 and 4, and 5, and 6. And one, and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5... Move your feet... and 1... and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5... Thank you. Beauvois... mail! Thank you! Dear Sir, I'm still here, I won't be coming back soon. I met some guy with whom I'll work in a scuba diving center. At minus 20 meters, you don't think at all. It is difficult to forget. If you changed your mind, I could come back at once. Yours truly, Abadi Christophe. Tomorrow will be a sunny day, 20 to 22 degrees Celsius in the afternoon A solar wind will blow slowly over the bay. A cloudless sky. Summer is starting. On the deserted beach, all the shellfish who would have thought so, mourn the loss of summer, which now has gone away... We've put away the holidays, in cardboard suitcases and it's sad when you think of the season of sun and songs. Yet I know, next year, All will bloom again, we'll come back, but in the meantime I feel sorry to leave the sea and my house. The north wind will get used to run without the sail boats, but it is in my uncombed hair That I will miss it the most. The sun, my good friend, will only burn me from afar, thinking that we're sore at each other to be apart The train will take me towards autumn, back to the city in the rain My pain will be for no one. I'll keep as a friend. But in the first days of summer, forgetting all my troubles, we'll come back and party with shellfish, on the sunny beach.
