[laughs] We thought you were stronger than this, Anne-Marie. [whimpers] I can't breathe. [Anne-Marie] Let me out. Kim, she wants out. [Kim] Good, I'm sick of listening to her. What is this, pink? As of tonight, you're not a kid anymore. -No more pink. -[girls hoot] [tires screech] Wait! I need my medicine. Wait. [car horn honks] [car approaches] [cries] [screams] All right, now remember. I'm only two hours away if you need anything. Okay? I'll be fine. Oh, I know you'll be fine. Of course, you'll be fine. Who needs a mother when you got 4000 young, fun people to play with? Go away before you make me cry and I look like the biggest baby on campus. Okay I'm going. Oh wait. I forgot. What is it? It's my sorority pin when I pledged Pi Gamma Beta. Maybe it'll bring you luck. I don't know about pledge this year. I want to work on the paper... Maybe you can go and take a look? You have no idea how much fun I had when I was a Pi Gamm. You know, they might not even invite me to join. Don't be silly. I love you. You sure you've got everything? Positive. Call me Sunday? If I have time. Ow!

Hello. Hey, you must be Lisa, right? Yeah, and you're Martha? I hate that name. Everybody calls me "Blue". I took the right side. I hope that's okay. -Yeah, that's fine. -Cool. [punk music continues] Oh my God, don't tell me this is the line. It hasn't moved for 15 minutes. I can't believe this. All I do is keep getting push from one line to another. Tell me about it. My schedule is getting completely screwed. I'm going to go nuts. First, the roommate from hell and now this. I bet your roommate doesn't have blue hair. You're kidding. I'm totally serious. [man] Registration is now closing for lunch for one hour, we re-open at one o'clock. Why is my life like this? I guess were in this together. We might as well make the most of it. Want half? -You sure? -Yeah. Thanks, you're a saint. By the way... I'm sorry. I'm Shelby. Oh, Lisa. Hi. It's so great to finally find a friendly face here. Why couldn't we have been roommates? A Girl Scout conference? Yeah, we haven't seen each other in, like, three years? Yeah, I had no idea she was even coming Anders. You were still Girl Scouts in high school? We'll be scouts forever. Hey. It's no problem. You two seem meant for each other. [laughs] [screams and laughter] Come on, let's go explore. Where to? I don't know. Everywhere. -[Shelby] What's that? -Mom's old sorority pin. She gave it to me for good luck. Cool. You going to go Greek? Maybe. I told her I'd check it out. Have you thought about pledging? Are you kidding? I haven't stopped thinking about it. Loads of friends, parties every night, totally gorgeous guys... It can be that great. [kids shouting] [party music playing] [kids clamoring] [boy hooting] [car horn honks] [girls screeching] Okay I take it back. It's completely insane. I think I've died and gone to heaven. [music and shouting continue] It's easy, man. Just watch. [cheering] [Drea] What are you doing, Jamison? You don't have to take advantage of unsuspecting freshmen to get kissed. [girls laugh] I would kiss you too, but we all know, everyone's already had a piece of Pi. Not that you would know, but once you've tried Pi, you'll never settle for second best. You two better take off. Yeah, thanks. Maybe we'll see you during rush. Definitely. [laughter] But you haven't taken your first Journalism class. I'm enrolled right now. Well, perhaps we should talk when you completed it. As you can see, we're fully staffed. Oh I'm sorry, I just wanted you to take a second look at my pieces. I think that if you would... Rather uninspiring. Are we, through yet? No, sir, I also wanted to tell you know that I was the editor of my high school newspaper-- Hey, Carl... [overlapping speech] Excuse me, we're in the middle of something here. It sounds like you're in the middle of a high school resume. This is more important. Well, I doubt it's more important to me. -Do you even work here? -Not yet. And if you don't let me finish, I never will. [Steven] Now that would be a great loss to us. Now that's the first intelligent thing you've said. Enough. You're both giving me a headache. Mr. Tyler here thinks he's orking for The Washington Post. Well, I'm sorry if I take my job seriously. I hope I haven't kept you from getting a Pulitzer. Are you always this assertive? If it will get me the job. Who are you anyway? Mr. Tyler, meet Lisa Connors, the newest member of The Daily Crusader staff. I look like at a total loser . [Lisa] You look great. You're just lying to make me feel better. Like that. That's amazing. [Shelby] You can wear it if you want. You serious? Of course. We're roommates now, doubling our wardrobe is twice the fun. Cool. Thanks. Okay, so what am I supposed to say these girls? Just be yourself. Rush week is about everyone getting to know each other. Think about it like you're interviewing them. Right. Easy for you to say. [sighs] Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get in. Yes, you will. But I have absolutely nothing to say to them. Nothing. Okay, I'm gonna let you in on a Connors family secret. Anytime that you feel like you don't know what to say to someone, just complement them on what they're wearing and ask them where they bought it. Okay. And that's really going to work? According to my mom, it never fails. Okay, come on. We have Kappa Gams as seven, Alpha Tau at eight. And tomorrow... [classical music playing] The Kappas pride ourselves on a commitment to leadership and community service. We constantly ask ourselves "Can we do more?" [bell rings] Hi, I'm Victoria. Let me tell you little bit about ourselves. The Kappas pride ourselves on a commitment to leadership and community service. We constantly ask ourselves, "Can we do more?" [bell tinkles] I think you will really fit in here. What did you say your major was? Journalism. That is so cool. Maybe you'll be one of those anchors on the evening news. This one was your mom's sorority, right? Yep, I say we give it 15 minutes and then we leave. I can't believe how boring these things are. [Shelby] Yeah, I know. I never thought I'd get this sick of talking about myself. -Hi. Come on in. -Hi. Hi. I'm Kim Lessing. -Hi. -Welcome to Pi Gamma Beta. This is Drea Davenport. She was the pledge last year. we've met. Haven't we? Well, not officially. I'm Lisa Connors, and this is... [Kim] You're Lisa. We were wondering when you would show up. Your mother called, and said you be coming by. Oh, that was nice of her. Look, you might as well get this over with, you know you're not getting out of here without seeing all of the pictures of her when she was here, and her old room and anything else we can dig out. Yeah, I was afraid of this. Come on, I'll try to make this as painless as possible. Hi. That's a beautiful jacket you're wearing. Where did you get it? Do you like it? There's this wonderful vintage store downtown. Have you met Paige Tashman? She's rushing this year too. -Paige, this is... -Shelby. Hi. Nice to meet you. That's not my mom, is it? No. Take a closer look. That's not you? [chuckles] Pretty amazing,huh? -Yeah, you really changed. -In just a year. It never would've happened without the house. How do you mean? The sisters really support each other. It's like no matter what happens, there's always someone there for you. Like family. Right. I'm serious. Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean to be rude. It's just... Well... see my dad left when I was four, and my mom was always working, So, I don't exactly count on family to be there. I'll tell you what, whether you decide to pledge or not, I hope you feel free to come here whenever you want. Consider the Pi Gamms your family. Thanks. And speaking of family... your mother, the flower child. [both laugh] She always tells me I don't know how to dress. Come on. [burps] Ooh, that's attractive. Didn't know I had an audience. A little too much partying? It's rush week. Don't tell me you're going Greek. Maybe. And here I thought you might actually be smart. Sorry to disappoint you. You know, one of the pledges disappeared last year they were hazing her. How do you know that? I just do. Everybody tried to deny that it happened, but I'm positive that's what it was. And she just disappeared into thin air? I'm sure it was the administration, because they're afraid of bad press. What are you doing? I'm following you? Why? Well, Carl Bernstein is giving a lecture on Thursday and I got two tickets, so I thought maybe you'd want to go. With you? Well, that was the idea. [chuckles] Okay. Really? -Yeah -Okay. Great. Well, I-I-I... Yeah. I'll catch you later at The Daily Crusader tomorrow. Yeah. Whoops. [chuckles] [bell tolls] Lisa. It snowed here. You think were going the right way? Yeah, there it is. I see the bonfire. [kids cheering] [Terry] Out of my way. Go, Terry. [grunting] Hey you guys finally showed up. Yeah, we got a little lost, though. [Drea laughs] You two have to catch up. -Thanks. -Thank you. Come on Terry's kicking everybody's butts. Whoo! Did she win again. I think the guys are all afraid of her now. [laughs] Glad you two could make it. We're excited to be here. Thanks. Now you're going to see what being a Pi Gamm is really about. This is all the fun stuff. Go Terry. [loud cheering] Way to go, Terry. Who's next? -You. -Me? Oh, no thanks. Afraid to get your pretty clothes all dirty? [Drea] Leave her alone, Terry. She's just a freshman. She is a legacy, like I was. She can do it. You don't want everyone to think you're chicken, do you? Yeah, come on Lisa. Do it. Okay. -[applause] -All right. [laughs] [Drea] Go for it, Lisa. Okay, I'll probably lose. I have total faith in you. Rules are simple. First one to the top, drink the shot and get back down, wins. Anything goes. Okay, three, two, one, go. [cheering] [grunting] [Terry] Bitch. -[cheering continues] -[Terry grunts] -Whoo -[giggles] Come on. Back off! [Lisa grunts] [indistinct chatter] As you all know, the rush period is coming to an end shortly. You'll be getting your bids and you'll be deciding whether or not you want to pledge. Now this is a very exciting time, but only if you're responsible for your own actions. And by responsibility, I mean, don't let things get out of hand. As Dean of students here, I... Well, it's my responsibility that you get all the benefit out of Anders College that you can, but you do it safely. So, remember, my door is always open if you want to come talk. All right? Anytime. Thank you, Dean Curtis.. There are refreshments in the other room. Same crap every year. Shelby? What's wrong? I just want to go home. Everybody hates me. No, nobody hates you. Yes they do. They think I'm stupid and ugly. Hey. Don't say that. What if I don't make it in? What if you get a bid and I don't? You'll get a bid. We both will. Look, I won't pledge if they don't take us both. Okay? Really? Promise. We're a team, remember? Thanks. You're the greatest. Hey, did you notice how Bernstein doesn't even mention Woodward anymore? I know. When he was talking about Watergate, it was like it was from a movie or something. Yeah, it's all those things. -Hey, you want to get some ice cream? -Sure. Like I was saying, Watergate, Vietnam War, Kennedy getting shot... Everything happened before we were even born. I know. You know what the problem is though? Is that we don't have Burns called "moral leadership." Who's Burns? James McGregor Burns? He wrote that book called Leadership back in the 70s. -No. -It won the Pulitzer. Like I know every book that won the Pulitzer. Do you read all the time? What, they don't allow you to read in your little sorority? I'm not in a sorority yet. Hi, can I taste the Chocolate Ritz, please? What? -Nothing. -You were staring. No, no...you look great.. Thanks. Thank you. Mmm. It's really good. You want to taste? Tastes good. Um...we'll take two. [chuckles] [Steven] Hey. Hi. Are you back here hiding from the world? Yeah, I was kind of tired. What you reading? Nothing? I thought it wouldn't hurt to take a look. -Steven, it's the library. -[Steven] So? See, you thought reading was boring. How can you be so calm? What are you talking about? They're voting tonight. You act like you're not even nervous. There's not much more we can do at this point. [scoffs] God I hate sitting in some stupid class when there's really important stuff going on. Okay. Next is Paige Tashman. She's too...fat. Shannon only wants anorexics in the house. We do have a reputation to maintain. Keep in mind, her dad owns that house at Lake Hope. We could use it for weekenders. Okay. Vote. Three reds and she's history. Ooh! Hah. Barely. Okay, next. The queen of the wannabes. This is Shelby Blake. -Anybody home? -Oh, come in. You got a sec? For you? Anytime. You may not think so after we're through. I didn't get in, did I? I'm really sorry, Lisa. Why? Some people just thought you didn't want it bad enough. But I-I do want it. You guys have become my best friends. I don't know anyone else here. It's a little late now. What if I talk to them? -The ones who didn't want me... -Lisa-- Surprise! That was priceless. -[girls laugh] -[Lisa sighs] Oh my God, I could not kept a straight face much longer. What's going on? You're in. We both are. -What? -Yes. Lisa. It was a joke. You should've seen the look on your face. I thought you were gonna start begging me. See, it all worked out, just like you said it would. Smile. Girls, you've now been officially tapped. Welcome to Pi Gamma Beta. [girls giggle] Wait, you guys. Smile. [tribal music playing] The Rose is the symbol of our unity. It represents our commitment to sisterhood. By giving the very source of our lives to the rose, we also give it our strength. By joining Pi Gamma Beta, we give up what we are for what we can be. By adding your blood, you give up yourself... to be come part of something greater than you ever imagined. By joining Pi Gamma Beta, you give up what you are what you can be. By giving your blood, you give up yourself... to become something greater than you ever imagined. [alarm clock rings] Time to get up girls. Your trainings begun. What's going on? First rule, don't speak unless you're asked a direct question. Come on, come on. Let's go. I think I'm going to just love Hell Week. Paige you missed a spot. Remember, one of you girls is going to win sisterhood award at the end of the week. To win that honor, you have to demonstrate three things: Unity, trust, and commitment. Working together is the first step. So when you're done in here, you can start in on the bathrooms. [girls laugh] This floor is a mess. [girls laugh] Come on. Get busy. We have to get the bathrooms done by 8:00. [Kim] This is it. The statue's in the Dean's backyard. Are you sure we can lift it? Kyle's did it a few years ago. Of course, most of them got expelled. Who's gonna climb over and unlock the gate? Lisa? I will. I'll do it. You're going to get us busted before we even start. You sure? Yeah, definitely. [Shelby] Oh! Okay. [Paige] Are you sure she can get out? Shhh. [sighs] So we could get kicked out of school for this? That's what makes it exciting. -[dog barking] -[Shelby screams] Shelby, come on. Shelby. Come on. Hurry. You're going to get us busted. Come on. Grab a leg. Hurry. -[girls clamoring] -[dog barking] Come on, come on. Hurry up. -[Shelby] Grab my hand. -Come on. -Help her. -Hurry. Here she comes. She's stuck. It's happening again. Shhh. [Dean Curtis] Virgo, stop that! -[Curtis] Right now! -Hurry up. Virgo! [windhield wipers moving] [rain pouring] [Lisa gasps] Hey. Come on you guys, this isn't funny. The second part of your training involves trust. Part of being in Pi Gamma Beta is knowing that... no matter what... you must always have faith in your sisters. [glass shatters] Open your mouths. Commitment. Unity. Trust. Go ahead. [coughs] You know, Shelby... last year I won the sisterhood award. Maybe this year you'll be voted best pledge you'd like that wouldn't you? To be the best. [crunches] Excellent. Don't you trust me, Lisa? Very good. I knew you wouldn't let me down. [kids chattering] [sighs] I'll level with you, Miss Connors, this is disappointing work. I'll rewrite them. What's the point? It's old news. We may only be a college paper, but I expect 100% from the people on staff at all times. That's what I'm giving. All I know is your first articles were excellent. Now I'm getting this. Things have just been a little crazy the past couple of weeks. Well, maybe take a little rest from The Daily Crusader. It's been a lot put on you right from the start of school. I can handle it. I'll just write another article. I didn't bring you in here to argue the point, Lisa. You come back and see me next semester, we'll take another shot at it. Okay? Hey! What's going on? Lisa, what the hell's gotten into you? I can't talk right now. You can never talk. course you can't talk. I've been trying to call you for the past two days, but you're never there. This isn't a good time, Steven. Listen Lisa, if you don't want to go out with me please just say so.. I told you this was going to be a crazy week. Oh that's right. How could I forget? It's slave and master week over on Greek Row. -You don't understand. -No, I don't. I thought we had something kind of nice starting. What? I just get cut off now? Is that how it works? -Hi, it's me. -Lisa, hey. I was beginning to think you'd fallen off the face of the earth. Not yet, but I'm close. Everything okay? Everything pretty much sucks right now. Oh, Hell Week, huh? [chuckles] Well, don't worry. It'll be over before you know it. -Right. -Oh, come on, don't be so negative. Listen, I've told everybody in the office how excited I am about you getting in. You want to trade places? Lisa, why don't you just stick it out. You'll be glad you did. Really. Mom, I gotta go. [girls chatter] [whistle blows] You were hard to track down. What, they finally let you out of your cage? Not really. I'm hiding out for a few hours. [whistle blows] Steven, I acted like a jerk the other day. I'm really sorry. It doesn't matter. I had no idea how time-consuming pledging would be. No, don't use that as an excuse. You decide who you want to see and what you want to do. Not some girls' club. -It's not that easy. -So drop it. I can't. It's really important to my mother. If that's the only thing that she considers important then you two have some issues to work out. You're just so sure you're right all the time. Aren't you? [whistle blows] You have this little black and white theory about everything, and to hell with what everyone else thinks. I didn't come here to find you to get preached at. I came here because I needed a friend. [cheering] [girls hooting] Paige, be sexy. -Let's go. Walk. -Sexy, Paige, you can't bag a guy if you're walking like a chicken. You call that sexy? Let's go, Paige. [girls clamoring] I had no idea you are so fat. [laughs] Let's see you try a little harder. Come on back a little bit. Let's go. Whoo! No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait... she needs a nickname. How about "Saddlebags"? How about "Baby Breasts"? No, wait. You're baby breasts. This is so humiliating. It'll all be over before we know it. It'll be fine. Yep. Let's mark her up, girls. "Baby Breasts," that's your new name, Paige. [hooting] Oh, little "Baby Breasts." [all] Aw. -Come on. Aw. -Come on, Paige. You're gonna have to try a little harder than that. That should knock her out of the running for the Sisterhood Award. What's happening to you? Next. Come on. Let's go Shelby. Let's see if you can cut it. [girls hooting, shouting] Are you okay? [sobs] I can't do this anymore. Then don't. You don't have to do anything you don't want. Lisa... Go join the pledges. -I was just... -I'll take care of this. Right here... [girls chattering] Ah, Lisa... you're next. You're next. [overlapping speech] We lost her. Okay, walk... She could be called "Thunder Thighs". Silence! I can see a few more areas of improvement. You remember, now, cellulite is our enemy. -[sobs] -You can step down now. [sobs] You're through. [sobs] Now all you have to do, [girls laugh] Now, all you have to do, is just hang it. out there. [Kim] They'll be able to see it for miles. [laughs] I can't, I can't... It's too high. Don't be such a baby. You want to win the Sisterhood Award. Don't you, Shelby? [Drea] You have to get over your fears. Trust us, Shelby. We're your sisters. [girls chattering] Hey! You didn't take your turn on the table. I decided to skip it. -Who said you could do that? -I did. Where's Shelby? You better watch your mouth. You're not supposed to talk unless I give you permission. Hey! Where's Shelby? I haven't seen her. Come on. We're planting flags. [high pitched scream] [crowd shouts] [girl screams] [sobs] Shelby! [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] -Sergeant Sands. -Curtis. Sorry to get you up in the middle of the night. [crowd chatter] What happened? I don't know. She was drinking all those shots. Then she just ran off. Did you see her? No. She wanted to be the best. She said she was going to surprise us. She must have been trying to hang the banner when she fell. [Steven] Hey! Nobody's seen you for a couple of hours. I was getting worried. You okay? I just keep seeing her lying there on the ground. All broken, and... I try to bring up some other image, but I can't. What was going on? It all happened so fast. Was she alone? Maybe somebody was with her on the tower. I don't know. I wasn't there. I don't know. I'm sorry. For many of us, Shelby Blake was still the little girl we'd always known. We trust the Lord will watch over her for us, both as the child we remember and as the young woman she was becoming. Amen. [priest] I am so sorry. If there's anything we can do to help you, please let us know. Lisa? Hi, Mr. Blake. Hi. I am so sorry. We want to thank you for coming. You and the others... Yeah. I wish there was something that I could have done. We all do. This just doesn't make any sense. I know. I just can't imagine what she was doing up there in the first place. She was afraid of heights. She was? She wouldn't even climb a tree. - Then-- - Lisa. We should go if we want to get back to campus at a reasonable hour. Okay, I'll be right there. We want you to know, we're really going to miss Shelby. She was so sweet. Yeah. Sweet. Sorry we have to go so soon. It's a long way back. That was so sad. I've never known anyone who died. It'll be up to us to make sure the Pi Gamms are all dealing with it okay. especially the pledges. Yeah, the important thing now is the house. Right. We don't want this to get out of hand. Did you know Shelby was afraid of heights? No, I didn't. Seems strange that she'd on top of that building all alone. Doesn't it? Well, you never know what people will do when people are drinking, I guess. Can we talk about something else? [sighs] Do you want me to drive? [sniffles] I'm fine. I'm sorry, but that's all I can tell you at this point. Anders University does everything in our power to prevent accidents like that. Sadly, we don't always succeed. Dean Curtis, is there any possibility that this death is a result of hazing? Hazing is strictly forbidden by the University. And I like to add that our record is spotless in this area. Well maybe that's because these incidents keep getting swept under the carpet. Are you referring to something in particular? Well, I'm referring to a pledge that nearly died last year. That doesn't sound familiar to me. You have a name? No, I've just heard rumors from several sources. Rumors are different from facts. Perhaps you should learn the difference before you start making accusations. [crowd clamoring] I shouldn't have left her alone. Honey, you can't blame yourself. It was an accident. But if I'd been there... You sure you don't want to come home? [sighs] I keep imagining that she's going to walk through the door any minute. All happy and excited and were going to talk about what sort of day we had. Maybe you should go spend a couple of nights at the sorority house. You shouldn't be alone. [scoffs] I'm fine alone. I'm used to it. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. All I'm suggesting is that you spend a couple of nights with friends. I'll think about it. Lisa, I'm just trying to help. Okay I'll go. Does that make you happy? Lisa... [Lisa] I didn't mean to steal your bed. Don't be silly. I'll just go crash with Terry. This must be really hard for you. You can stay here as long as you like. I feel like we're real sisters. Thanks. Hi...is Lisa Connors here? No. Really? Well, she left a message telling me she would be here. Look, she's really upset. Okay? Listen, could you just tell her that I'm here I'm sure she'd want to see me. I already told you, she's upset. She doesn't want to see anybody. Lisa, it's really nice to have you here. Try and get some sleep. Okay? [Drea] You doing okay? It'll all be over soon. Just do what we said, and everything will be fine. Why can't we just tell the Dean what was going on? Because we never tell the secrets of the house. Don't you remember the vows you took? But after all that's happened... Lisa... you're part of the Pi Gamma Beta family now. You signed your oath in blood. Lisa, could you come with me now? Were here for you. It might be a good idea if you go talk to one of the psychologists on campus. Just so you have somebody to talk to. Maybe I will. I keep thinking I should of stayed with her, maybe she'd still be alive. From what the others told me, your friend was very anxious to prove she belonged. Evidently she been drinking a great deal. I don't really remember her drinking anything. -She was too nervous. -Nervous? Well... there was a lot going on. What, at the sorority house? Yeah. Lisa, we understand you've been under a lot of pressure. You're having a hard time accepting your friend's death you want to blame somebody that's perfectly understandable. But why don't you take a little time and think about this? That's all? Well, for now. I don't want to trouble you anymore than I have to. You don't want to know what really happened, do you? We do know. Lame break. Just shoot, okay? I was just kidding. I'm not in the mood for your kidding tonight. We should do something, to keep up morale and all. It doesn't really matter much now, does it? You know, Kim, we could really use some leadership right now. Well, maybe you should do it, Drea. Don't you even care about what happened? Of course I care. Just because I don't cry and go on and on about it, like some people, doesn't mean I don't care. We can all fall apart. Someone's got to be strong. Hey. Come on you guys. We shouldn't fight. Not now. You're right. [Drea] Sorry. -This whole thing is just so... -I know. I know. Damn. I win. You beat Terry? She got lucky. Stupid eightball went in the pocket too early. You're up, Lisa. Oh, um... Maybe you could take my turn. Why don't we play teams? Lisa and I will take on you two. Really I don't feel like it. Well... you're overruled. I think this will help us take our mind off things for a while. Don't you? [sighs] I'll break. Steven you wrote this? They're hiding something. It's just like what happened last year. Who is this girl you keep talking about? Are you sure you didn't just make her up? You'll see what I mean once I find her. You don't know these girls, I do. They wouldn't do something like this. Lisa, they were hazing you. That happens everywhere. That doesn't mean they killed, for God sakes. You just can't keep throwing these accusations around. I mean, what if it really was an accident? And what if it wasn't? Don't you understand? Your the key here. You should know more than anyone. This could be a breakthrough story. I don't care about a story. Well you should, because she was your best friend. Who's going to find the truth if you don't? I'm so sick of everyone telling me what I should do. It's your responsibility. And I sure as hell don't need any lectures on responsibility from you. It's important at times like this for us to come together. Try and make some sense out of something that seems so unfair... and to offer our love and support to each other. [Steven] Hey. Our bond is what keeps us strong. And our bond is made sacred by our loyalty. And we must remember our duty to the house and to the vows we took: -[men laugh] -[Steven groans] Commitment... Unity... Trust. Commitment... Unity... Trust. -[Steven grunts] -[men laugh] Committment, Unity, Trust. [glass shattering] Here, fill this out. [Steven] Now you know it was because of that editorial I wrote. There was a copy stuck to the car. Well, maybe they had a right to be angry. It was a pretty strongly worded piece. What is it going to take... for you guys to be convinced that something wrong is going on? [Lisa] Steven... They said at the paper you were attacked. Are you okay? I guess I must be, because the sergeant says it might have been figment of my imagination. I never said that. Come on in. Now you were there the night of the accident,weren't you? Um...yeah, she was my roommate. Maybe you can answer a question for me? Why were there colored markings on your roommate's body? Markings? Most of them had been rubbed off. Do you know anything about that? No. You sure? It doesn't matter anyway, right? I mean... -She was drunk and she fell. -[Sands] She wasn't drunk. What? The lab tests show that she hadn't had a drink all night. [Lisa] Paige. -Yeah? -You have a minute? -What for? -Just... to talk. But somewhere away from here though. I can't. Paige, I need to know what happened after I left that night. Paige. I'm sorry, I can't. Were about to have a quick meeting, you two should be downstairs. Am I supposed to just not talk to anyone? You're imagining things. That reporter boyfriend of yours is making you paranoid. You don't know anything about him. He's just using you. To try and dig up dirt on the house. -Lisa, we should go down. -[Lisa] I'm not coming. -It's a required meeting. -What's going on? Why don't you want me to find out what happened that night. Just do what I tell you, okay? Remember, you're still just a pledge. You know what? I'm tired of being "just a pledge." I'm ready to be a human being again. Lisa, you walk away like this. You're out. Do you understand? Out. Is this what you meant by family, Drea? -Hi. -Hey. I didn't expect to see you here tonight. Disappointed? That's a dumb question. What's wrong? [sighs] I guess I just don't know what to believe anymore. Look, if you're seeing me just because of this story. You don't have to bother. I'll still help you. That doesn't sound like you talking. The Lisa I know is much smarter than that. Everything is just so messed up right now. But you can't let them get to you. You're much stronger than they are. Where did that come from? I'm so used to being disappointed, you're kind of a nice change of pace. [both chuckle] What you're saying is that you lied to me. They told me not to say anything. And you do everything people tell you? -No. -This is not her fault. These girls are dangerous. Why can't you see that? All I see is a bunch of kids that got carried away. Aren't you going to do anything? Sure. I'll shake up every fraternity and sorority on campus. And you know when I'll get? Silence. We already told you. You can't keep asking us the same questions. What you're saying is... that none of you is responsible for the markings on her body. And nobody noticed when Shelby Blake just wandered off on her own the other night? Nobody knows anything about eating glass? Initiations in the clock tower. In fact, not a one of you knows a damn thing. Is that right? Well this innocent school girl act is really starting to irritate me. Somebody better start talking, or I can make this very uncomfortable. How about you? Both my parents are lawyers. Maybe I should call and ask them -the definition of harassment. -Oh, I see. I see... You girls want to make this difficult, huh? That's fine. I can be difficult. [Shelby screaming] [Lisa sobs] Shelby. Are you sure you don't want me to come over with you? I don't mind. They were just trying to scare me. It won't be as easy to do in daylight. Okay. So what are you going to do? I'm going to try and talk to Paige. I think she may know something. Don't do anything risky, all right. It's not worth you getting hurt over. Okay? Promise? Promise. Hi. -Mom? -I drove down to see you. I guess I should have called first. How long have you been here? About 6:30 this morning. I guess you didn't sleep here last night, huh? [sighs] Your friend Drea called. She's really worried about you. There's more to it than you think. You know what honey? I think you're still in shock about what happened. I'm not in shock-- Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's going to take some time. I've spoken to your friends at the house and-- Those aren't my friends. Look, Lisa I know you want to blame someone for all of this, but it's no one's fault. They're just as devastated by Shelby's death as you are. Forget about it, Mom. You know, there's no need to use that tone with me. I'm just trying to help. -Then listen to what I'm saying. -I am listening. But this is not... This is when you need your friends the most. Don't shut them out. I'm not going back to that house. I can't make it any simpler than that. Okay, then why don't you just come home with me for a few days. Take some time away. Then you'll see how important it is to you. It's important to you. I joined so that you'd be proud of me. You don't understand. Never mind. [loud party music playing] [kids chattering] [party music and chatter] You crashing the party? I want to talk to Paige. Well, I don't think she's much in the mood for talking. Maybe I should ask her. Maybe... you should shut the hell up. There's been cops all over the road because of you. Trust me, you have no idea what you're inviting. It can get really ugly. Is that what you want? We can take care of that right now. Make sure you don't go spouting your mouth off. -Are you Lisa Connors? -Yes. You were just visiting a fraternity over on 28th Street? Yeah, I was there for a few minutes. I need you to get out of the car, please. What did I do? What have we got there? That's not mine. Course is not. Put your hands behind your back, please. This is a mistake. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one... What the hell is going on? I told you. They set me up. Lisa. You cannot keep making things up just to escape the truth. Why is it so hard for you to believe me? Because people don't do this to one another. You mean sorority sisters don't. Lisa... I know how difficult this must be for you to deal with, but this is not the way. It wasn't mine. You know, you're lucky that they let you off with a warning. I just want to make sure that it doesn't happen again. So...We'll get help. Okay. I can go with you if you like. Mom, I know you don't believe me, but something happened up on that roof. Something they don't want anyone to know about. I'm going to have to stay in town for a couple of days until this mess gets cleared up. But you know something, I think it would be best after that if you came home with me, where I can keep an eye on you. I don't need you to keep an eye on me. I can handle my life on my own. Really? I used to think so. Now, I'm not so sure. What do you want? I want to know who planted the drugs. Don't blame us if you have a drug problem. Was it you Terry? Lisa, you're out of control. You guys are hiding something. You have been ever since the night of the tower. If we are, it's for your own good. You swore an oath, Lisa. An oath you sealed with blood, that you'd protect the house and all the sisters in it. What about the sister that's dead? Just let it drop. It's better for everyone this way. I won't let it drop. Not until I get the truth Were trying to protect you. Me? Of course, why do you think Shelby was up there in the first place. What are you talking about? She was trying to prove she was just as good as you, Lisa. Didn't you understand that? She kept saying you were prettier and smarter and more popular than she was. That's why she kept pushing herself. We didn't want you to have to live with this. We tried to be good sisters, but you couldn't let it go, could you? All we wanted to do was protect you. So how did you finally track her down? Through the finance department. Her name is Anne-Marie Johnson, and the school wrote her a pretty nice check. A check doesn't prove she was hazed. You're the one who insisted on coming along. If you don't believe it, Why are you even here? Let's just see what she has to say. Okay? Yes? I really thought I was going to die. I mean, that car's headlights... [Anne-Marie whimpers] [screams] [Steven] But they stopped. Barely. [Lisa] Were you hurt? Not physically too bad. I was just kind of messed up for a while. It just didn't seem fair. I was so mad. I was supposed to be the first person in my family to get a college degree. You know? It just didn't seem very fair. I don't understand. Why didn't you tell anybody? The school offered me some money if I didn't say anything. And to tell you the truth, that was fine with me. I mean, no way was I going to go back there. I knew the Pi Gamms would just make my life miserable. The Pi Gamms? Yeah, Pi Gamma Beta. That was my sorority. [Anne Marie] Do you know it? Yeah. I can't print a story like this without solid proof. Carl, what more do you want? I got an interview. This school has paid this girl off to keep her quiet. You have the word of one bitter ex-student. Come on, that's not enough for this size accusation. You know that every word on that page is true. All I know is I can't... I can't print this story. This wasn't your decision, was it? I'm sorry. Technically, the paper is controlled by Anders' administration. Well... So much for freedom of the press. I'm afraid that's not all. As of today, you are no longer on staff. It's all been lies. First they said she was drinking, then they said it was my fault. It's all been lies. Well, everybody here seems happy with the lies. [Lisa] Steven. Let go of me. -[man] Let's go. Let's go. -[Lisa] Steven. -[Lisa] Steven. -Lisa. -[Lisa whimpers] -[man] Stay down. You want to live through this night? Better just chill. This is what happens to people who break their vows. [Lisa] Let me go. Next time, stay out of other people's business. Okay? Okay. [ragged breathing] [distant car horn honks] [honking continues] [car honks] Oh my God. I've looked everywhere for you. I'm so happy to see you. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Look at you. Look at what they did to you. I was so scared. I thought I'd lost you for good. [kisses] Come on. I was searching all night. I can't believe I found you. There has to be something else we can do. I've got people searching everywhere. We'll find her. I was so stupid. What kind of mother doesn't believe in her own daughter? Mrs. Connors. Hi, Mom. Oh, you're all right. I am so sorry. I don't know why I didn't listen to you. It's just that sometimes it's hard for me to realize that you're all grown up. The next time I try to tell you how to live your life, will you do me a favor? Will you tell me to mind my own business? I might just take you up on that. Good. Kim! You've got a message. What? Lisa called. She wanted you to meet her at the clock tower. She said to tell you she's bringing Anne-Marie Johnson along. Lisa said she's an old friend of yours. [bell tolls] Where's Anne-Marie? She couldn't make it. I told you she was bluffing. I wasn't. [Anne Marie's voice] I don't remember all their names, just the driver. Her name was Kim. Kim Lessing. What happened this time, Kim? Did you push her? Or did you just tell Shelby to be the best pledge she had to learn to fly? It wasn't me... I didn't do anything. It was her. Kim... She just kept pushing and pushing her. [girls laugh] Now all you have to do is just hang it... out there. [Kim] They'll be able to see it for miles. [laughs] I can't. I can't. It's too high. Don't be such a baby. Really, I gotta go back down. You want to win the sisterhood award... don't you Shelby? Why are you doing this? It all happened so fast. I'm serious. I'm really really afraid of heights. I get sick and stuff. You have to get over your fears. Trust us, Shelby. We're your sisters. No, I can't. Do it! I told you to just get up there and hang it! Do it, Shelby! Do it! [Shelby screams] Shelby! We made Paige swear not to tell. It was an accident. Why didn't you just leave it alone? It's not like we weren't sorry. This is the second time it happened, Drea. When did you think it would stop? I wish I could go back and change it all, but I can't. What do you want? I want to make sure it never happens again. No you don't. You just want to destroy the house. We took you in... made you a part of our family. Don't you understand how important that is? It's not more important than someone's life. Nothing's that important. It's strange... I thought, knowing what really happened, would make me feel better. But the truth is, nothing can bring Shelby back. It's a shame, you know. She was so excited when she got in. She thought it was going to be one big party. All I can tell you at this point, is that two women from Shelby's Blake's sorority have come forward. They've admitted to being... connected to the accident. Now, would you classify these activities as hazing? Yes. And...what do you plan to do about it?. Well, clearly, the University will have to look into the depth of problem. And this is a situation that we intend to rectify. What a waste. I'm sorry, Mom. I know it meant a lot to you. You know, I don't think it was the sorority at all. I think it was the people there that I loved. The house was just a way of bringing us together. I'll miss having that. [Steven] Hopefully you won't miss it too much. [Lisa] Well, if I do, it's my own fault. I mean, it's not like there's nothing else to do here. [sinister music]
