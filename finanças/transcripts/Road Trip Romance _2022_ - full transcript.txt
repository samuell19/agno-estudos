This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Megan Miller. Are you in Denver? Oh, hello, Mrs. Evans. Not for three more days. Yes, I'm in Denver. On my way to the client as we speak, but I'm so excited about tonight. Me too. Is Mom? Is she staying sane? Well, she volunteered to coordinate corsages for the wedding party. So... How hard could that be? Thank you. Do you know how many flowers are in bloom right now? I mean, she's obsessing. She just wants everything to be perfect. Yeah. I do, too. And it will be better than perfect. It will be real and full of heart. Just like the bride. I'm marrying Jack. I still can't quite believe it. I know he is one heck of a catch. After all, he is the luckiest guy in the world. Yeah, he kind of is. Alright. Showtime. I gotta buzz. I'll see you at 7:00. Okay, but don't be late. Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of the night will keep this maid of honor from being at her sister's bachelorette party. I'll see you later. Mom: Blair! Blair! We've had a breakthrough! Uh, I'll be down in a few, Mom. May I help you? Hi, I'm Megan Miller. I have a 10:00 o'clock appointment with Mrs. O'Reilly. Fun For All. She's still with her 9:00 o'clock, but it shouldn't be too long. Would you like a water? Um, no, that's okay. Thanks. Okay. I'll just go... I'll sit over there. Thanks. For the bridesmaids I was thinking roses or carnations, because, I mean, naturally that's what you do, right? But then I thought, where's the fun in that? If we keep to a color scheme, we could do a parade of different flowers. Roses, carnations, daisies, lisianthis, whatever all nestled in baby's breath. I mean you can never go wrong with baby's breath, right? Uh, yeah. The eye will be drawn in and pow, the dresses will pop. Whatever you want mom. No, it's whatever you want. It's your day. Well, I want you to pick, because whatever you choose will be amazing. Hi, Mrs. M. Hi, Della. Oh! Sorry. - Is it 10:30 already? - Just about. We'll see how the flowers look on the girls. Okay. Want to bring them up? Okay. Excuse me. Did Mrs. O'Riley mention how much longer she's gonna be? I'm sorry. No. Oh. Well, that 9:00 must be going real well. Probably just got Ms. O'Riley talking. When she starts she could go all day. Well, that's good to know. Thanks. Do you have another appointment to get to? Nope. This is my only stop in Denver. I just... I have a flight to catch this afternoon. Oh, that shouldn't be a problem. Sure I can't get you a water? You know what? I will get that water. Mom! I love the colors. Yeah, it turned out great. Yes! Like I said, amazing. Yeah. Oh. I never did get the hang of these. You look fabulous. Man: You know, I hear it's a beautiful stadium. Mrs. O'Riley: It is! It's a real gem. Next time I'm in town I'll have to try and catch a game. Let me know. We have excellent box seats. I'll set you up. That'd be amazing. Alden Brown. Megan Miller? Both: What are you doing here? Novelties R Us? Fun For All? You must be my 10:00 o'clock. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Novelties R Us is your company. And Fun For All is yours. Thank you for stopping in, Alden. We'll be in touch. Yes, and if you have any questions, just give me a call or shoot me an email. Of course. I have kept you waiting long enough, Miss... Megan is totally fine. Oh, I'm Leanne. Nice to meet you. So, you and Alden know each other? Yeah, we grew up together. We went to rival high schools. Oh! Small world. Yeah, sure is. Too small. That's adorable. Yeah, and as you can see from our promotional materials, we have a dynamic product line with a ton of variety. I gotta admit, the hand-sewn whoopee cushion made me smile, but these guys... The perfect poster toy for what Fun For All is all about. See all our toys are traditional mechanics. So, no electronics. Oh, my kids would love these. And our packaging doubles as eye-catching store displays. So, the entire product line is really going to stand out in your department stores. If we decide to carry vintage toys. No, you must. People nowadays, especially children, they're turning off technology. They're oversaturated. The market for old-fashioned toys is exploding. Well, it must be if two sharp Millennials like you and Alden have started competing companies. Competition in name only. My product line is the best. You're really passionate about what you do. Yeah. Fun For All has been a dream of mine since... Since I can remember. I like that. But the thing is, Megan, Mountain State Consolidated has gotten to where it is, the largest most profitable chain of family-owned department stores in the region, because we always expand prudently. Respecting verities. That's what Fun For All is all about. Let me walk you through the Mountain State story. Show you how we got here. Well, it all started with Great Grandpa O'Riley, a man of vision. In the spring of 1890, he stowed away in the hold of a freighter. Blair, you will never guess who I just ran into! Alden brown! The guy from Central High? Yes! You saw him where? We were pitching to the same client. Apparently, he has his own vintage toy business. Wow. What are the chances? I wish I had a trigger warning. Seeing him brought back so many high school horror stories. Yeah. I bet. Debates, the pep club showdowns. We competed then and we're competing now, but this time he is not going to win. You go, girl. I am on my way to the airport. I will see you soon. Megan, you did remember to bring... That super something special borrowed to go with your old, new, and blue? Uh-huh. Of course, I did. Why did I even ask? Oh, no. What? The Denver Airport is closed. What? Why? Wildcat baggage handler strike? You're still coming tonight, right? Got to go. Bye. It's a regional strike. So, Colorado Springs is still open. There's a flight leaving to Wichita in about three hours. So, I was thinking that I could rent a car... To... Blair, I'm going to call you back. Bye. Excuse me. I really need to rent a car like five minutes ago. Oh, okay. I'll ask all the other people in line to step aside so you can go first. Really? Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, everybody needs to run a car like 10 minutes ago. Um... The thing is, it's an emergency. It's not like I'm having a baby or a heart attack or I need a car to save the world, but my sister is getting married and her bachelorette party is tonight. Wow, a bachelorette party. That does sound important. Yeah. No, it's not. I'm really sorry, Stella. You must be having a really stressful day and I'm being a total jerk. It's just I'm the maid of honor and... I'm hosting the party, and it's for my little sister, and I've always been there for her and I never let her down and... the thought of me letting her down and not being there for her, it just... I'm sorry. Sorry, Stella. I'm sorry I bothered you. Have a nice day. Me? I would do anything for my little sister Anything. Follow me. Megan, hey! Did you get a car!? - Can't talk, Alden. - Where are you headed? Colorado Springs, I'm catching a flight to Wichita. Wichita? I need to get the Wichita. Well, good luck with that. Let me come with you. No, thank you. I'll pay for gas, I'll pay for the rental fee. I will buy you a first class upgrade. Are you pleading with me? Begging. Megan, please. It's an emergency. An emergency? Are you having a baby? A heart attack? Have you been tasked to save the world? It's my dad. It's his retirement party. The entire family's going to be there. Everyone's flying in. I've never missed a really important family event, and I've never not been there for my dad, not ever. How can I say no to that? Let me grab my stuff. Well-played. I call shotgun. Hey, I noticed you don't have a suitcase. Yeah, I checked it through to Wichita when I left from Seattle this morning. Wait, you live In Seattle, too? This day keeps on getting better and better. I live in Belltown. Where do you live? That's great. We're neighbors. I'm feeling a bit of a chill over here, Megatron. Don't call me that. My friends only call me that and you are definitely not one of them. Well, high school was ages ago. So, maybe we could be friends now. Not until you give me that trophy stole for me back. What trophy? Regional debate champ. Senior year. Uh, I won that fair and square. Oh, no, you did not. Oh, no. Well, I guess we're not the only ones with a bright idea. Colorado Springs to Wichita, sold out. I guess you're going to be flying without me. What? I never got a flight. I thought I could just buy a plane ticket at the airport. Oh. It's okay. It's totally okay. When's the next flight? Not until tomorrow. Okay. What are we gonna do? Go back to Denver? Maybe there's a bus that'll take us to Wichita. No, that's going to take forever. - Why don't we just drive there? - Let's just drive there. - Can't be that far. - 78 hours tops. We'd be there by midnight. I'll miss the bachelorette party. And my dad's barbecue isn't until Sunday. But I'll make it in time for the wedding. Cousins, I can hang out with them on Saturday. And the rehearsal dinner. Seven to eight hours in the car. Together. For my sister. For my dad. I still want that trophy. I'm not even sure if I still have it. Yes, you are and yes, you do. Top shelf in the family room, right next to my Student of the Year award. That's gonna look so perfect next to mine. Oh, no! I know, I'm so bummed. There's no way at all that you can get here on time? No, and I wrote a killer toast, too. Why don't you email it to me? I'll read it to everyone. No, you can't read it! It has to be read to you. You'll see. I know! Okay. Why don't you call me back when it's time and I'll read the toast over the phone? Perfect. Hey, I gotta jump off. Jack's here, but keep me posted on your progress. - I will. - Bye. Hi, handsome. Sorry. I only let my fiance call me that. What brings you here? Baby's breath. For your mom. Ah, yes, the wedding party look. We have a ton of baby's breath in our garden. It's over-flowering with it. Jack. So, Megan's not going to be able to make the bachelorette party. - Why not? - She can't get a flight. She's driving in from Denver instead. I thought she was hosting the party. I'll enlist Della to do it. Ah, you'll Della-gate her. Three more days, Jack, and then that's it. No more puns. You promised. I know. I'm just trying to get it out of my system so we can enjoy our pun-free-moon. You know, you get better mileage if you use cruise control. I'm not really worried about the mileage. You're paying for the gas. Okay if I put the radio on? No, no music. I find it very distracting. How about talk radio? No. Podcast? No. Why don't you just listen to something on your phone? I can't, earbuds in a moving vehicle making me nauseous. Okay, then read something. That's even worse. Why don't we play a game? 20 Questions? No, thank you. - Alphabet. - You'd cheat. I would not cheat. A leopard cannot change his stripes. Spots. Whatever. This is about that debate, isn't it? For starters. You actually think that I cheated. No, I know that you did. Really? How? Resolved cafeteria food fails to meet RDA guidelines? You presented totally bogus data to show that it does. And were you able to prove that the data was... - Data were. - Bogus in rebuttal? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. I was having internet problems. I didn't have time to research it. Ah, see, I was in the same auditorium using the same internet and funny, I didn't have any trouble rebutting your claims. Oh, yeah, with bogus data. Robert's Rules of Order clearly state that it is the burden of the rebutter... I do know! I know, I know, I know the rules. Case closed. Case closed. Cheater. Sore loser. Well, you're going to be a sore loser this time around, because that Consolidated account is mine. You haven't seen my product line. Oh, I have, I always research the competition. Really? Well, so have I. I've seen your stuff. I know and it rocks. It's not bad. You are going to hate the taste of my dust. We'll see about that. Of course, if you want to give me a hard time about that debate I could say the same thing about the school spirit film competition. Oh, give me a break, that movie, if you can even call it that, was totally amateurish. As it should be in a film made by amateurs. And what is your point? Charles Garvey. Charles? Okay. What about Charles? Award-winning documentarian. Oh, and the father of your classmate Toby Garvey. The director of your film. Who clearly inherited his father's talents. Not to mention his state-of-the-art camera, sound, and lighting equipment, and his participation. He was only a consultant on the movie. - Like ducks. - "Like ducks." Who says like ducks? But I'm not going to give you a hard time about it. You know why? No, but I'm sure you're going to tell me. Because it was a competition and people compete to win. You have a genius for stating the obvious. Come to think of it. I may have been the best thing that ever happened to you in high school. I gave you someone to compete against. But like you said, we're not in high school anymore. Yet here we are, still competing. "Best thing to happen to me in high school?" I know you are annoying, but I did not think you were delusional. You know I'm right. What? Where's the car? Did we park it somewhere else? No, no. We parked in front of the window with the caramel corn sign. That's why I bought some. It was smart ad placement. Someone stole our car? - My luggage is in there! - My sample suitcase, my phone! My something borrowed. I really appreciate all your help with this all. Are you sure there's nothing else I can do? Thanks. What did he say? Well, he issued an APB. Well, if they're tracking your cell, we'll find my phone, though, right? You didn't activate that feature? I don't like that thing. I don't like that someone can track me down. I find it very creepy, Besides, it doesn't matter if they don't find the phone. I'm not the owner of it. They have to send it back to the car rental place, which can't send us a new one, because the airport strike, they're all booked up. Mm-hm. Well, I contacted Uber and Lyft and every ride company that you've never heard of. No one is going to take us because they all need a fair back to Wichita, which I guess makes sense. Making sense does not get us to Wichita. No, but I have something that does. He wanted $5,000 for it, but I sweet-talked him down to four and a half, and a free tank of gas. You bought this? Yeah, put it on my card. Well, how do you even know it runs? That's really reassuring, like everything printed on a dot matrix is. Okay, have a little faith, alright? The guy's in mechanic, said the engines cherry. Wow, if I had known that you were this gullible in high school, I would have never lost to you. If you got a better idea on how to get us to Wichita, I'd love to hear it. Must be your sister. Blair, hi. Hey, I just got your message. The car was stolen? Yeah, I know, but we landed another one. Oh, good. Okay, I need to call back on this phone when it's time for the toast, okay? And whose phone is this? Alden Brown. What? I know. I know. I'll tell you about it when I see you next, okay? I'll talk to you later. Alright, let's get this dog and pony show on the road. Oh, that door doesn't open. Gotta use the driver door. ♪ My darling, take my word for it ♪ ♪ You've come too far to let me down ♪ Oh, sorry. My shoe! Okay. Oh, we're going to have to... figure out how to get this off. ♪ You're aching for an easy answer ♪ ♪ Don't be taking more than you can count... ♪ You okay? Not really. Look, I'm trying not to be annoying. Not everything is about you. And apparently I'm failing. It's my something borrowed. Yeah. What is that about anyway? It's tradition. The bride. She always wears something old, something new, something... Something borrowed, something blue. - Yeah. - Got it. So, Blair's something borrowed she was borrowing from me. It was this beautiful vintage shawl I found at a Good Will in high school, and I actually wore it... To senior prom. How do you know that? I was there, remember? The time I was dating... Katie MacDougall, I remember. Yeah, right. It was a beautiful shawl. Guys aren't supposed to notice stuff like that. Well, I did. Well, Blair, she thought it was beautiful too and she designed her whole wedding dress around it, but now it's gone. I had it in my sample suitcase. You know, in case the airlines lost my luggage. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm just turning out to be the worst maid of honor ever. Your sister won't mind. Yeah, but I do. You know, I remember your sister. She was one heck of a cheerleader. Yeah, she is. Allstate. Who's she marrying? Anybody I know? Jack Evans. He went to Central. She's marrying Greenback Jack? Oh, yeah. She is. That guy was money in the bank. Letter for every sports team. The Debate Club even looked up to him. What's he doing now? He is teaching at a high school. That's how he and Blair met. They're both teachers together. Oh, P.E.? Special Ed. Right. Of course, not just a great athlete. Great guy. And he was very picky. Your sister must really be something. Yeah, she is. He did pun non-stop though. Oh, I know. I know, she's trying to wean him off of that, but I think she might have to state an intervention. - Good luck. - Uh-oh. There's road work ahead, but it says we're still on the fastest route, but we won't be if the traffic backs up. Let's just take this exit here. No, I think we should stick with the GPS. No, as soon as we turn off it's going to recalculate, and I don't want to get in a traffic jam. This exit. Alright. I mean, a bachelorette pep rally? Who's idea was that? Megan. She put all this together, with a little help from me. It seems like a lot of help. Well, she wasn't here. I was. Well, she should be calling soon. So, I can't wait. It's not recalculating. Try a different app. I did, but I'm going to try another one. So, we have no idea where we are. - We're fine, Alden. - No, we're not fine. - We're lost. - Don't overreact. Okay? Look, maybe this app right here. No nothing. Uh-oh. Okay. I knew I should have never let you convince me to get off the highway. Since when have I ever talked you into doing anything? I knew it was a bad idea. How was I supposed to know there'd be a dead zone? It said we were on the fastest route. Well, sometimes GPS, they lie. Yeah, and sometimes they don't work! Are you okay? Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine. It just came out of nowhere. You sure? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh, no. Come on! Well, at least we have our signal back. Is AAA on the way? Looks like it. How much longer? It's hard to say, and I'm going to shut my phone off soon. It's practically dead. Too much hopping around to find a decent GPS. Alden, I said, I was sorry, and, no, you cannot turn that thing off, because I have to call in my toast. Uh, there's like 2% battery life left. Hey! ♪ If it was up to me, we'd always be together ♪ I remember I was at the top of the pyramid... You almost fell! No, no. It was fine. I had a ball. Is Megan ready for her toast? Oh, no! No, she can't. Their phone's about to die. So, no toast? Well, she grabbed it from the cloud and sent it as an attachment, but someone else is going to have to read it. Mom? I'm giving a toast at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow. Della? No. No, I mean, I couldn't. I'm terrible at stuff like this. Della, please. Come on. You're my bestie. Please? Sure. ♪ La la la la Hey, ev... Excuse me. ♪ Sometimes the world ain't always fair ♪ Hey. Can everyone gather? Toast! Um, okay. So, Megan, was supposed to give the toast, but she's not here. So, I'm going to give it. Go, Della! "Blair, we are so pumped to be here with you tonight." We love you as a daughter, a sister, a niece, a cousin, a friend, but above all as the most legendary cheerleader "this town has ever seen." "This is for you, girl. Hope we do you justice." Okay, ladies, grab your pom-poms and get ready to shake. "Play link." Oh. Play link, okay. Play link. Oh, my God. ♪ Old and new and blue and borrowed ♪ ♪ Blair, you're getting wed tomorrow ♪ ♪ Is this what you really want? ♪ ♪ Is your Jack a true Galant? ♪ Because if he's not, we've got your back ♪ ♪ We'll tar and feather Mr. Jack ♪ ♪ But if your mind is set on this ♪ ♪ We hope you live in wedded bliss ♪ ♪ Yeah, if your heart is too far gone. ♪ ♪ You better get some practice on ♪ ♪ Yeah, when I say "I," you say "do" ♪ - I. I. - Do. Do. - I. - Do! Ladies, give it up for your bride to be! I love you. So, how's it look? Oh, this engine's cherry, but you knocked a few things out of whack when you went off the road. Well, can you fix it? Sure. Oh, good. But not here. I got to take it back to the garage. Oh, a Renaissance Fair. Now, that's really cool. October 8th? Isn't that tomorrow? Yeah, it's a huge event. People are coming from all over. So, how long do you think it's going to take to repair our van? Oh, that won't take long. Is there a diner or a restaurant we can eat at while we're waiting, or? Well, I'm not gonna patch it up tonight. No, no. I'm off the mechanic's clock. It's strictly emergency road service stuff. So... I guess we just spend the night. Yeah, that's going to be a problem. - A problem? - What? Well, like I said, it's a big event, and all the motels, the two that we have in town, they're booked. Okay, I guess we sleep in the car? Well, that sounds uncomfortable. Tell you what? Why don't you come stay with Zadie and me. We're empty-nesters now. Oh, no, no. We really don't want to impose. Oh, it's not an imposition. It's an invitation. - Zadie. - Hi! Hi, come meet Mr. And Mrs. Stranded. Oh, no, no, no, we're not married. - Yeah. Just... - Sharing a ride. Well, whatever you are they've had a heck of a day. Charlie told me all about it when he called, you poor things. So listen, I got you some pajamas and warm socks. Charlie said that you and he were about the same size. Well, give or take a few inches. And, oh, our Sarah is a slip of a gal just like you. Oh, thank you so much. This is very, very nice. Now. Listen, I laid out some snacks and drinks for once they get all settled, okay? I hope you like fritters and sarsaparilla. I don't know. I've never had fritters and sarsaparilla. Me neither. Oh, then you are in for a treat. Isn't that right, Charlie? Okay. Well, come on. Let's get you settled. We're sleeping in a tent. A tent? This is a real beauty. Overflow from the Renaissance Fair. It's got plenty of room, you'll see. We thought that you... Were empty nesters. We are. Zadie commandeered Sarah's room for a crafting studio, and I'm using Seth's to store my LPs. Vinyl's made a comeback. Come on. Let's get this puppy up. Okay. I've never put a tent together before. It's easy. How do you know? Girl scouts. Ambassador gold. Impressive. No idea what that means. It's scouting highest honor. I don't want to brag. Well, that'd be a first. Hey, Alden, grab a corner. Yeah. Morning, sweetheart. Morning, Mom. Oh, what time did Megan get in last night? I didn't hear come in. She didn't. Car trouble. Oh, no. They spent the night in a town called Mackenzie. Where's that? According to GPS, the middle of nowhere. What kind of car trouble? I don't know, but the mechanic said it would be easy to fix. So, she'll be here in time for the rehearsal tonight. I'm sure she will. Entereth! Good morrow, gentlefolk. How sleepest thou? Fair. To middling. Oh, no. Was the tent uncomfortable? No, the tank was great. It just turns out somebody snores. - Everybody snores. - I don't snore. - Oh, yeah, you do. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. - Are you hungry? Yes. Thank you, Zadie. Oh, this looks so delicious. Thank you so much. It's Renaissance Day. So we try to eat as they did. Oh. Great outfits. Oh, Mackenzie. It's a Scottish Renaissance Fair. Well-observed, Milady. Oh, can I borrow a phone charger? Phones almost out of juice. Not today, milord. We're off the grid. Yes. Oh, is there a power outage? Oh, no, Milady. It's voluntary. We don't just dresseth as they did, we liveth as they did. - No electronics. - No. - No cell phones. Nope. - No. Woo, that seems like a very interesting challenge. So, I guess I'll just charge it when we get to town while you're fixing our car. Nay, milord, the whole town is offeth the grideth today. And thy carriage will not be fixeth 'til tomorrow. Wait, what? Did you just say tomorrow? There being no motorized carriages in what is our Renaissance one can't very well fixeth one. Didn't think to mention that last night? Well, we did not want to disturbeth your sleep. This is a disaster, an absolute disaster. The nearest town is about 20 miles away. We can walk there. We'll find another car. I can't walk 20 miles in a pair of heels or slippers. I need more comfortable shoes. Did they have comfortable shoes in the Renaissance. Only I don't know how we're going to buy a new car, because I maxed out my credit card on the SUV and you lost her phone and your purse. Please do not remind me. Wait, maybe we could hire someone there to drive us to Wichita. Maybe, but again, no money. Why does this keep on happening to us? Me thinketh the universe is aligned against us. Or maybe... Or maybe what? They're trying to tell us something. The stars? Okay, laugh at me all you want and I know you will but Fun For All is not just a business for me. It is my passion. So is Novelties R Us for me. Yeah, but, Alden, I really believe in what I'm doing. Providing the world with whoopee cushions and exploding fountain pens. Actually, yeah. And don't get me wrong, I love that thing, I really do, but in about five minutes it's gonna lose juice, and I'm going to feel completely untethered. And that is my point. That we're too wired in. That people don't take the time to slow down anymore. We're always looking forward, which of course you have to do, but sometimes... you got to look back. And Novelties R Us and Fun For All gives people the chance to do that. Yes. To feel like kids again. Kids in a simpler, less frenetic time. When people appreciated... The verities. Okay, I'm not laughing. Alden, think about it. This whole crazy trip is putting us to the test, giving us a chance to walk our walk and talk our talk. So, why don't we give into it and spend the day? Seriously? Yeah, Charlie said we'd be out of here first thing tomorrow. So, that gives me plenty of time to get back to Wichita, to be the maid of honor, an unrehearsed one, but how hard can that be? Besides, by the time we get to the next town, assuming we can even get a car, I'm going to miss the rehearsal anyway. And I could be there today to help my mom and my brother and my cousins prep for the big barbecue, but do they really need me for that? I don't know, it could be kind of... fun? So, what do you say? I say... a very good day to thee. Renaissance. Ooh! No, I don't think they did that five hundred years ago. - Probably right. - Okay. I need to use that phone, I have to call home, and let them know what is up. So do I. Damsels in distress first. Wait, who said that I'm a damsel? Fine, I'm making my call first. That's okay. Thank you. Just give me like five minutes. Five minutes? These boots are amazingly comfortable. So's the kilt. No wonder you guys wear these things. We call it a skirt. Wow, this is amazing. Check out the band. Somebody has an admirer. Whatever dost thou mean? Thou art shameless. Welcometh. Oh, don't you two looketh right at home! Thank you for the clothing. Charlie: You are crushing that kilt. Crushing, Charles? I faileth to understand. Crusheth. Who are your new friends, Mayor? Mayor? You're the mayor? Ceremonial title, a few responsibilities. Co-equal remuneration. Don't you believe it. He rules us down with an iron hand. Megan, Alden. This is Franklin. Franklin, we very much enjoyeth you're fiddling. Why, thank you, Milady. Franklin's troupe... The Mackenzie Minstrels. They're going to be playing at the dance later on tonight. Which I now regreteth. Oh, how so, dear sir? Well, if I playeth, I do not dance it with thee. Okay. Nice to meet you, Franklin. Arts and Crafts? We should go check that out. Anon! Come playeth our games. Archery, quoits. Quoits? Horseshoes. How do you know that? Races? Kickball? So, no jousting? Doth thou joust? Nay. I think that sounds fun. If thou enjoyeth a little friendly competition. Oh, we enjoyeth competition. Friendly or otherwise. Most wondrous. Well, I'll see thee thither. Ah, huzzah, the McDaniel's are here! Both: Anon! Anon! That was a little nervy. What was? The fiddler, pitching woo like that. "Pitching woo," is that what we're calling it? You didn't seem to mind it one bit. I guess I didn't. For all he knew we could have been a couple. You, me, a couple? Please. It's really pretty. Is that... Yup, that's Will. The best man. Wow. I know. Big-time wow. I'm happy you're here, though. - Hey. - Hey. Still no Megan? No. She's not going to make it until tomorrow. But Della is going to fill in for now. Will, meet your maid of honor for the day. Pleasure to meet you, Della. You, too. Looks like she means it, Will. In fact, she looks downright Dell-lighted. Jack. That's good, right? - Jack. - Babe. This is really cool. I know not what thoust mean by "cool," Milady, but thank you. You made this? Yeah, I carve them and I do the mechanics and Zadie paints them. I have a business that sells toys like these. So, do I. It's not the same as these. These are really special. If you're ever interested in selling to a wider market... Both: My company would be the perfect partner for you. I know not of that. I enjoyeth making them for family and friends. Yet we sell at them to any old anybody who's interested. So maybe we would like to hear about your company. Both: Companies. Companies. Submiteth your proposals and we'll see who's we like better. Don't worry. We shalleth. May the best proposal winneth. Wow. Fantastic. Whoa. Should bring some of this home to my dad. He loves apple cider. Tell me about your dad. You said he's retiring. Yeah, he's a typesetter, he's an artist. Loves his work. So why is he retiring? Because he loves golf and tennis and rock climbing more. Your dad is a jock? Yeah, when it comes to my brothers and me, not an athlete in the bunch. I tried Little League, the only position I was suited for was left out. Although I will say when I was eight years old, I killed in ballroom dancing. How about you? What's your dad like? He passed away about two years ago. I'm so sorry. Thanks. Just makes Blair's wedding all that more important. It's the first big family event since we lost him. Ooh. Very athletic. Yeah, I don't see a debate platform or chess tournament. I think we're in trouble. We? Captain of the volleyball and track team. Of course you were. How would your boyfriend in Seattle feel if he knew you were making eyes at a Mackenzie Minstrel? I am not making eyes, and no, there's no boyfriend. So, the minstrel has a chance. Well, I haven't met Will yet. Who's Will? Jack's best man. Apparently we're perfect for each other. Sorry! Art thou in pain, good sir? Yes, used muscles I didn't know I had. Aye, in a Renaissance, we worketh hard and we playeth it hard. Clearly I'm not equipeth for these times. Well, uh, I doth not knoweth that. While the real men huntereth and gathereth, I prefereth to stayeth at home and readeth. Much like our beloved William Shakespeare. He was also a brilliant actor, successful entrepreneur, and a formidable wrestler. I did a report on him when I was in seventh grade. But tis his intelligence that attracteth the damsels. Megan claimeth to not be a damsel. Be that as it may, even in these times, a lady knoweth how to, well, whet a man's interest by paying attention to someone else. Are we having a teachable moment here, guys? "Teachable moment?" Why, whatever dost thou meaneth? Excuse me. I'm sorry about your foot. I just got to face it. Renaissance is not my jam. Ah, what a grand day, fellow Mackenzians. It's an honor to be in Mackenzie and to stand in the same place that my forebears did when they founded this town. Sixth generation. And they would have loved this annual fair and they'd want to thank ye all for coming from near and far including our very special guests. Yes, it's a grand day, indeed, but all grand days must end, and the Mackenzie Minstrels will help us bid the past goodbye with a lovely 16th century waltz. Valorous night, good townfolk. Walketh home safely. Did he say... The waltz! I can do that! Second grade ballroom dancing. Listen, I don't know how to waltz. I don't... It's okay. Just, uh, follow my lead. Put your hand on my shoulder. Like that. Ready? I think so. One, two three. That's okay. There you go. As far as rehearsal dinners go, I'd say that was a darn good one. It was the best one of mine I've ever been to. Somebody's hitting it off. Will told me he's completely smitten. Yeah, as well he should be. I mean, she's a doll. I always thought so. But I don't think she has. I love seeing her shine like this. Insightful, empathetic, kind. I mean, I could really go for a guy like you. Don't. I'm getting married tomorrow. She's a very lucky woman. Not as lucky as I am. Okay, buster. That's it. You're not seeing me again until you're on that altar tomorrow. Not true. I'll be seeing you constantly right here. Hey. Aren't you forgetting something? Sorry, I'd stay and "punnel" you with yolks, but, alas, I must make like autumn and leaf. That's my guy. Oh! Excuse me! Ah, enough. Enough. Oh, I thought you were enjoying it. No, I was I'm just so exhausted. Ah, right. Because winning race after race makes you really drained, right? Don't forget quoits. How could I? Surprised they didn't throw me in the pillory for attempted assault with a deadly weapon. I had a lot of fun today. I'm glad we stayed. Yeah, me too. No, you did not. Not until the waltz. I mean, you were completely miserable. You lost every game. Okay, fine. Yeah, I was miserable, but not because you beat me at every single game. Like ducks it wasn't. Who says "like ducks?" Hey, where are you going? Charlie and Zadie's place is this way noted. - No, it isn't. - Yes, it is. - Nope. - Yes. Fine, suit yourself, but I'm going to go this way. A man who admits he's lost. How refreshing. Okay, say it. Say what? I told you so. What kind of a person would say that? An olden kind of person? Megan Miller, you don't know me at all. Let's get an aerial view. What? Not inspired to climb? I'm wearing a very long skirt. I'm wearing a kilt. Come on. Alright. Hey. Are you ready for tomorrow? Scooch over. Sometimes I think I've been ready for tomorrow my whole life. Here. I remember my wedding day so vividly. It was the happiest day of my life, until I held Megan in my arms, then you. What was your secret, Mom? You and Dad, you guys, you made happy seem so easy. Oh, it was all smoke and mirrors. No, it wasn't. Well, I don't know. I... I really don't only that every day I'd wake up and tell myself to make this day the best one yet. No matter what came at me. Your dad did the same. Still can't believe that he's not going to be there tomorrow. Oh, sweetheart. He will. Megan is going to look so pretty in that dress tomorrow. If she gets here. She will. Maybe it's a mirage. Maybe the whole town is. Like Brigadoon. It only appears every hundred years. And then dissolves into the mist again. Or maybe we're just good and lost. I'll put my money on that one. Although... It's a darn nice place to be lost in. Copy that. What did you mean earlier when you said that it wasn't me beating you that made you miserable? Really? You need me to say it? Yeah. I was jealous. Jealous? Of you and Franklin. I kind of thought that's what it was. Okay, but tell me something. Was there not a part of you that was... trying to make me jealous? I guess I was. What's that all about? Is that a serious question? Megan, come on. In high school... I had a huge crush on you. You did? Yeah, every debate, every prep squad rally. Every time our schools were facing off, I, uh... I hoped you'd be there. Wow. How come you never asked me out then? Like you would have said yes. I think I would have. Really? Yeah. I mean, you were only annoying, because you were good at absolutely everything, but... I always thought you were kinda cool. Wow. But that was in high school. - Yeah. - Yeah. Right, right. So, why would I try and make you jealous now? Yeah, why would you? But you were. And I was. Guess we slept here. Yep. Wait... Oh, I was gonna surprise you with it when we got to Wichita, but... it got a little cold last night. - Where did you get it? - The fair. One of the craft tables. It's not as perfect as the one you wore to the prom, but... I figure, it's yours now, and Blair can borrow it. Alden. Oh, thank you. Guess what. What? We couldn't see it in the dark. The lights were off, they were off the grid. So, direction-wise, I was right. You usually are. Shall we? We shall. There you are. Good morning. I was just about to come wake you up. I washed and dried your clothes. Oh, Zadie. So, why don't you have some nice breakfast, and then you can go and freshen up. Charlie is in the garage, working on your car. Thank you so much. You guys are the best. And I will be in touch real soon with a proposal for those toys. - So will I. - Mmm. Well, uh, we got a wee problem. Oh no. I got everything on that, uh, car, patched up just fine, and then I went to replace the busted serpentine belt, and um... well, I don't have the right size. Clean out of stock. I don't know what a serpentine belt is. - Neither do I. - Do we need one. Well if you wanna drive the car, you do. Alden: How soon can you get one? Ooh. Tomorrow? No! Alden and Megan's Reverie in Renaissanceville ends now! Charlie, we are going to Wichita, and if that car is not gonna get us there, you better help find a vehicle that will. Like, immediately. Uh... Ah... Well, I suppose you could take the tow truck. It's kinda pokey. It's just a little pokey, though. Okay, in 20 miles, there's a turn-off that'll take us to the interstate. Oh, this thing makes that van feel like a Ferrari. Oh, what? You have got to be kidding me. What? Are we being pulled over because we're driving too slow? Whatever we did, let's hope they write tickets around here fast. Fat chance. Here he comes. - Franklin? - Is this your vehicle, Miss? Uh, no. It's Charlie's. And where are you headed today? Wichita. Are you travelin' there with her, sir? What's this all about, Franklin? Stay in the vehicle, both of you. Hands where I can see them. Wha... - What did we do? - I don't know. - Did you know he was a cop? - No, I had no idea. - Well, he seems pretty upset. - Very upset. He's coming. Okay, okay. Couple of jugs of Mackenzie's cider. I hear you like it. I had you pretty scared, didn't I? Uh, yeah, you did. Franklin: I just fiddle for fun. This is my day job. Ah, well, you're pretty good at it. Thank you. And you may be the single most uncoordinated human being I have ever met... until you waltz, then you're magic, dude. Thank you... both of you, for helping to make yesterday one of my best days ever. Oh, well, it was one of our best days too. Well, I'll let you off with a warning this time. And I hope to see you back here next year. Won't be the same fair without ya. Thanks, Franklin. - Brigadoon. - Oh, yes! Definitely. You sure you don't wanna disappear into the mist with him? Oh, I'm tempted, but I think I'm good. All right. Let's get out of here. Definitely. No. Ugh! No! Come on, you've got to be kidding me. - Come on. - Come on, pokey! Quick, before He changes His mind. Okay. They've just hit the city limits, but there's a lot of traffic. So... what do you want to do? Um... Let's give her another... 20 minutes. And then come be my maid of honor. Oh, Blair. I can't... I will love having you beside me, and so will Will. Oh, sweetheart. You look glorious. Mom, you're crying already! Oh, I'll be crying all day. Get used to it. Let's do this. Oh, great. We're boxed in. - Ah! - Ah! - We made it! - It is a miracle. So, I was thinking, when we're back in Seattle... Yeah, let's maybe, uh, get together sometime. Yeah, hang out, or something. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Well, I... I should be getting in there. Right, yes. Go. Uh, have a great wedding. Thanks, you too. Have a great party. Thanks. Don't forget the cider. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, thanks. - There you go. And thank you again. Okay, bye. Okay. Oh! Ah, Della. Uh, Megan. Look at that dress. You look fantastic. Thanks. Are you on your way over there? Uh, yeah, they left your mom's car for you, but I... I can wait. Oh, no, no, no, that's okay. You can just go over there, let them know I am on my way. I have no cellphone. Oh, right. I'll see you over there. Oh, um, oh... I left the invitation in my luggage. What church is it at? First Consecrational. Right. Okay. Thank you, Della. Bye. Megan! I'm such a bad person. I... I did such a bad thing. Della, what are you talking about? These past few days, I've felt so captivating and... attractive and... fun, and... guys don't go for me, you know they don't. But Will did, and I know the minute he sees you and walks down the aisle with you, he's gonna forget all about me, and who can blame him? You're so fabulous. So, I... I don't know what came over me. I think I lost my mind for a minute. And... So, you sent me to the wrong church? Yes. It's okay, Della. Let's get us to the right one. Come on, I'll follow you. They're getting a bit antsy in there. Well, I suppose I could get married with no maid of honor. Mom: Oh, no, no, sweetheart. They're here. You waited! Thank you! - Megan! - Blair! You look transcendent. Hi, Mom. Wait, why are you wearing... I'll tell you about it later. Ah, Will. I'm Megan. So nice to meet you. Best man and maid of honor they go behind the bridesmaids - and groomsmen, right? - Uh... Uh, no, Megan. You're the maid of honor. No time to change it. Plus, you rehearsed it. So, what number bridesmaid are you? Number one. And who am I walking with? Mom: Oh, just one moment! Here you go, sweetheart. - Thanks, Mom. - And for you. - Thanks, Mom. - All right. Let's get this girl married! Wait, hold that thought. I don't know. Oh, Megan. Now you're ready to get married. Thank you. Okay. Oh, Mom! Are you ready? Yes. The proverbial "they" say true love can overcome any obstacle. Although, I think snoring comes pretty close to being a deal breaker, if you ask me. Jack and Blair, I don't know what obstacles you had to overcome for the sake of your love. You ever hear this guy pun? Oh, right. Right, yeah. There's that. There's that. You do that. Well, okay, one thing, but let's hope that's it, now and forever. However, not all love is romantic. The love between two sisters is a pretty powerful one too. It is. Ugh! And let me tell you, the obstacles I had to get through to get to this sister! Okay, here I go. Um, an airport strike... a stolen car, stolen luggage, stolen phone! Which was the cruelest of them all. Oh, right, a van in a ditch... um, a day without electricity or internet... Which is not as gnarly as you think. An undersized serpentine belt... Which, I still don't know that that is. A tow truck going at the speed of snail, and a trip to the wrong church! Don't worry about it. Now, I could have just stayed home, and watched the countless uploads you guys are all gonna post of this wedding... And don't tell me you're not going to. But not be there... for my sister's biggest day? I can't imagine anything sadder, because this sister has been the brightest star in my sky since as long as I can remember. Blair, to see you so beautiful... with the rightest guy in the world for you, there is no obstacle that would have stopped me from being here today. - I love you. - I love you too. So, please raise your glass in helping me toast to the couple of this hour, and every hour, Jack and Blair Evans. Cheers. I needed that after my day... but thanks for all being here. ♪ ...is a Sunday ♪ Feels like I'm many miles from Monday... ♪ I think that's probably the cutest thing I've ever seen. That was really sweet of you. What you did at the church. Today's all about love. How can I get in the way of that? Oh, they've only known each other for a day. Oh, come on, Blair, think positive. Mmm, by the way, you neglected to mention the biggest obstacle to you getting here. What? Forty-eight hours joined at the hip with Alden Brown. I mean, he must have driven you crazy. Actually, he didn't. - No? - No. He wasn't as bad as I thought he was. Oh. Well, I'm glad to hear that. What is he doing here? You better go find out. Megan, go. ♪ You broke into my life and stole my heart... ♪ Thanks. I know that guy. We went to Central together. Yeah. It's Alden Brown. Right. Great guy. Hands down the smartest kid in class. - Let's go say hi. - Uh... why don't we go talk to my mom? ♪ The last thing on my mind was you, baby ♪ Wait, how did you know... Social media. Half the people here are live-updating this. I knew it. So, why aren't you at your dad's party then? I'm just taking a break. They probably don't even know I'm gone. Thing is, I was right, they didn't need me there. I needed me to be there and... I needed you to have this. Top shelf of the family room just like I thought. Oh, wow. You did not need to bring me this! Uh, I have it on good authority that I did. And I also don't have your number or your address in Seattle. Well, you know Fun For All does have a Contact Me link. About that. See, I was thinking, you could submit your proposal to Zadie and Charlie, and I could submit mine. Mmm-hmm. Would they be any different? No, probably not, no. So, I was thinking, what if we just submitted... - One proposal. - Right. - And then we could... - Share the business. Right. And then we'll do the same thing with... With Consolidated. We can stop chopping up the market. And then we'll just work together. Yeah. Why fight to crowd each other out of the space... That we love when we can just... Join forces. We could... Own it together. Fun Time Novelties. Novelties R Fun. Oh, whatever. Um... Look, the bottom line is... I don't wanna just maybe call you when we get to Seattle and maybe, sort of hang out. I want to see you as soon as I can, as soon as you're back, properly, like over dinner? Are you asking me out, Alden Brown? I think I am, Megan Miller. Well, took you long enough. What can I say, girls mature faster than boys. I think we debated that proposal. Uh, yeah, we did, and I won, but the data were bogus. No doubt. Okay, so just to be clear here. We don't hate each other anymore? I'm pretty sure that we don't. Um... I guess I should go back to my dad's party. Oh. Come on. One more dance? I could ask the DJ if he could play a waltz. I don't know. I mean, I don't want to steal Jack and Blair's thunder. I think after all we've been through, we deserve to steal a little bit of it. Don't you think?
