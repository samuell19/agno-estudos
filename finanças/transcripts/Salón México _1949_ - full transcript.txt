- Good evening, Merceditas. - Good evening, Lupe. Thank you. I have to win this contest. Tell everyone to vote for me. Thirteen. If they don't, beat them. But outside. Remember Paco, the cup is for you and the money is for me. Don't think about the dough, concentrate on winning. - We'll talk later. - No, Paco. I am in dire need of money. Move it, it'll be God's will. Dance a black "danzòn". - Dance a black "danzòn ". - That mulatta enjoys it... Dance a black danzòn. Dance a black danzòn - Well! That's it, not here. Paco, Paco. Paco, Paco. Paco, Paco. Paco, Paco. Paco, Paco. Number thirteen is the winner of the contest tonight... I will deliver the cup and the five hundred pesos. You figure it out. Give me my money, that was the deal. Look, don't be impertinent. Let's just turn the page. Go have a drink for our victory. Paco, please. I warn you, I don't like games, you know me. I'm asking you nicely, give it to me. I don't want to spite you. I need it badly. That's why I entered the contest. The money was for me. So you need it badly? Get dough somewhere else. There are some tourists... Rip them off, maybe they'll let you. Stop trying my patience, give it to me. You have to give me my money, I really need it. Paco... Give me half the money. And keep the cup. Here, keep the cup, that's more than you deserve. Paco. Give me half, we won the contest together. Leave me alone, will you? Come on, I'll give you half. Leave me alone, or I'll smack you. - Good morning, Miss Mercedes. - Good morning. Miss Mercedes. - Good morning, superintendent. - Hello. Did you come for you little sister? Yes, superintendent. I arrived in the city last night... to spend the day with her. The principal wants to talk to you. With me? She's in the office. Thank you. Excuse me. - Good morning, principal. - Hello. The superintendent said you wanted to see me. Yes. It's about Beatriz. I should have told you before. Don't you think you forsake her? The other parents pick up their girls on Saturdays. On Saturdays? That's when I work the hardest, principal. Besides, I don't forsake Beatriz. God knows I think about her all the time. I wait for Sundays to see her. Well, please make an effort and... normalize your situation with the school. You've never attended a test, party... or a mothers' meeting. Our students are young women. They notice these things, so do their families. Besides, don't you think that Beatriz... resents your distance? I work very hard, principal, in order to make a living.. And to provide for Beatriz. That's why I strive to sell different things... and scurry during the week... so come Sunday, I can see her. But I can assure you one thing. She'll have what her peers have. Look, I brought 500 pesos to pay for next month. And for Beatriz's uniform. And these under garments... for her to wear on Thursday, her birthday. She's turning seventeen. You have no excuse. I know you strive to give your sister an education. But please make an effort to be closer to the... school, do it for Beatriz's happiness. She's waiting for you outside. Excuse me. Good day. She's Beatriz, my baby sister. I enrolled her at this boarding school. I visit her every Sunday. See to your sister, Miss Mercedes. I just wanted to say hello, but I can do that at the hotel. I'm bound to see you over there anyhow. It was a pleasure, miss. Have a nice day, a nice outing. My friends go to mass at San elipe... or at Profesa. Why don't we? You say when. You like the cathedral better. It's so big and impressive. After being here, under its naves... everything else seems so small. Less overwhelming. Let's go, we're still going to the museum... to the lndependence party, and the parade tomorrow. - How much is this? - Ten pesos, miss. Ten pesos. I'm so proud of your intelligence... and your being the first in school. Not the first, Mercedes. Our of us have straight A's. I feel like crying at seeing you so tall. And so full of light. It's what I dreamed of for you. Or you to get far. Where there is no poverty... no shadows, no horrors. I simply wanted to tell you... how happy I am that you are practically a graduate. In December, God willing. Long live the lndependence! Long live the Heroic children! Long live Mexico. The music is good. I have no way to repay such kindness. I am at your service. Don't say that, Merceditas. I knew exactly what my obligation was. I am prepared to go to the police. I stole Paco's wallet, the one you were holding. Now you know why I needed the money. Let's go. Every day I move further from understanding things. Your having to do that, like a thief... while the real thieves... are respectable, surrounded by comforts. Life is backwards, I don't know where we're heading. I'm the one who should apologize. I startled you, didn't I? I thought you'd arrest me in front of my sister. You have a very cute and very pretty sister. You can tell from her eyes that she's smart. She's in school, she doesn't know what I do for a living. I pick her up on Sundays. That's why I need the money. To support her. Well, get to work. Go on. So, you aren't going to arrest me then? Get to work and make the money you need for your little sister. Hurrah, yes. - Enjoy yourself. - I can't any more. - Dance. - Ao. Nobody's going to rescue you, don't make a scene. Let's go outside, pretend we are very happy. Take the key to number six. I'll pay you back, Paco, just don't hurt me. Shut up, we'll talk upstairs. Please, Paco. Leave me alone. Don't hurt me. So, what did you say...? You thought you'd take the money... and papers from my wallet. There weren't any papers, Paco. There was only the 500 pesos. Where's the dough. If you don't give it to me I won't let you out... and I'll give you a beating. Where is it? I don't have it, Paco. - You thought you could con me. - Stop it. - Where is it? - Please, Paco, stop hitting me. Do you think I'm a fool? Don't hit me, no, please stop hitting me. Leave me alone, stop it, Paco. Not on my face, Paco. - No, Paco, don't. - Come on, come on, Mercedes. - I told you. - Leave me alone. I'm leaving. This dame took my wallet with all my papers... and 500 pesos, Take her to the dump. Wipe your face. And go. Come on, strike a man. You want a fight, but don't read me my rights. Ix your uniform, read me my rights. I'm the civil party. Strike a man, I say, if you're such a stud. Stop. So, now you know. You won't touch that woman with the tip of your finger... or I'll kill you. I told you not to mess with my Paco. Now you're going to have... a black eye for at least a month. Give me a beer. Wow! You almost got your eye knocked out. No, Merceditas. I'm the one who should be kissing your hands and feet. And the ground you step on. I always thought there was something strange in your life. Now that I know what it is, I admire your strength. You are pure gold... and gold is valuable wherever it is... even if it's the garbage. I would have rather been killed than you seeing me... the way you did. Rom now on I'll be like your shadow... to look after you in every way I can... so you can carry out the sacrifice... you have taken on to make a good person out of your sister. Yes. I want to see her become a doctor and get married. Even if it's my doom. Even if I end up like a dog. All, I ask God... is that she may never know. Merceditas. You're going to say that I chose a heck of a time... but I know that this is the right time, now... when I've seen what you are really like. Ighting on the bottom to reach the top. I am nothing but the son of common people. Or enty years... I've worn this uniform and tried to honor it. I am nothing but... a poor, honest man. The last representative of the law. I am no youngster. I became a widower ten years ago. Ever since then, I hadn't laid my eyes on any woman. Except for you, and I've been feeling this inside... for some time now. So, I might as well tell you. I love you. And I humbly ask you to be my wife. I know I don't deserve you... because, after all, I am a nobody. But I offer you all my love... and all my work. I am the healthiest in my company. I have three mentions on my file. And God willing this year I'll be promoted to corporal. And I'll have a badge. Lupe! Did you tell me your last name? Lpez, Merceditas. Lupe Lòpez. You know what I am. And in spite of it, you do this. Don't make me cry, look at the shape my face is in. I am totally serious, I swear on the Virgin... whose name I carry. We'll live wherever you choose, and your sister will never know. I have some savings... and I'm looking for a day job. But... But you know what I need... to cover my expenses, Lupe. You know why I'm here. Selling my services and chasing money... because if I worked as a maid or anything else... I wouldn't be able to pay the boarding school. You make six pesos... and I need a lot of money to support myself. A lot. You'd have to soil your uniform. The one you're so proud of. Or I'd have to be dirty at your side. Don't say that. Merceditas. You will soon be free... from that sacrifice. When your sister graduates and gets married. Merceditas, I'll wait for you until you are free. Juàrez shouldn't have died Oh, have died. Juàrez shouldn't have died Oh, have died. If Juàrez hadn't died... Miss Beatriz Gòmez. What subject did you get? - Heroism, principal. - That's a very nice subject. Deserving of you, due to its beauty and difficulty. Heroism. According to the dictionary, is the set of virtues and actions of a hero. The spirit of sacrifice. The self-denial that leads human beings... to carry out deeds sublime by God... for a nation or fellows. There is heroism in every sacrifice. He who sacrifices for others is a hero, or a heroin. There are so many forms of heroism. As many as self-denying people are able to assume. One. There is only one saint. He who sacrifices it all for God... setting himself completely aside. Such are the cases of... Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint *Bernadette. Another. The wise person, who struggles alone in a laboratory... searching for remedies to humankind's great diseases. For example... Pasteur. And Madame curie. And, there is also... the hidden and obscure... and anonymous heroism of a mother. Who struggles amidst poverty and desperation... to give her children a place in the world. Then, there's the heroism that defends a nation. Even if the enemy is more powerful... and even if his life is on the line... he fights for it on land... sea, or sky. Like Squad 201, which just got back from war. Here comes my son. Isn't the principal different? She's always so strict, and now she could jump for joy. Sure, she's expecting her son. Imagine, he flew in from Japan. I bet he'll be in uniform and decorated. I've never seen an airman before. Airman? Roberto is a lieutenant pilot. Plus, he's a hero from Squad 201. He's here, girls. Just in sight. This is Roberto, my son. At your service, Mr. Roberto. These are my girls, son. The best and most distinguished girls in the city. It is a pleasure to meet you, ladies. Thank you, Mr. Roberto. Chat while I make some tea. Be quiet, girls, you're startling him. What can I say about the army? - Anything you like. - All right. What I hated in the beginning was using this cane. But you get used to everything. The principal said that you will be well soon. They must have said that to comfort her. - Did the chinese wound you? - No, the Japanese. I mean, one Japanese. At Okinawa. Did you go to Japan, too? Yes, I did. I had the honor of accompanying general càrdenas Rodrìguez... and general McArthur to Tokyo during the triumphant entry. Girls, girls, wait a minute. Did you fight off hundreds of planes when you got hit? No, it was only one. And it was smaller than mine. He hit me and wounded my leg, so now... here I am limping. You poor thing. Beatriz, why are you standing there? - Who is she, what's her name? - Beatriz. Beatriz, come here. Don't be shy, come on. Have some tea, and tend to our guest of honor. Oh. Oh, heavens. I fell, didn't I? Yes, I think you did. How pretty, long live Mexico. Long live Mèxico. Pretty. Let's have some order. You're breaking the bottles. We said you wouldn't drink that. No it's written down. Let go, don't be funny. Tell me it's mine. What are 10 pesos for a railroad officer? Please. Tell her to be kind and you'll... give her your whole salary plus over time. Don't be mean, please. Give it to me, I need it so much. Put it down, I'll call the police. Don't make trouble with the town mulatta. Sit down, I want to talk. Lend me your horse to put my saddle on it. So, they beat you again. Look at what happened, you'd better stick with me. I love you, it hurts me to see you in bad company. Even a damned cop. Why don't you leave me alone? It's my life. You used to be a whim for me. I admit it. You were the novelty at the dance hall. Now it's different. For the first time, I feel jealous. Stick with the 5 or 6 women who covet you. I'm offering you my love. I love you, it's true. Come away with me. Between you and I there could never be anything. We're like poison ivy to each other. And don't try to take advantage of my fear. Remember, people kill out of fear, too. I swear it'll be different. I'll even let you take part in my business. Your business? You mean Ruth and lrma. I mean other deals that will make us rich. Work with me, your life will change. I don't know what you mean, but I don't want to see you. So, don't try to see me, either. Not only will you have to see me, you'll come begging. I can make you. Do you think I don't know your secret? I know what you do on Sundays. - Dance to this song. - Come on, pretty thing. Come on, have some fun. I needed to see you these past three Sundays. I would have told you about Roberto last week. - Who is Roberto? - The principal's son. He's a pilot with Squad 201. One of the heroes who fought in the Pacific. He was wounded in Okinawa and has 7 decorations. One from the U.S. congress. You know they only give those in exceptional cases. Last Sunday... the principal was kind enough to invite me with them. Roberto took us to the air strip, and then to the ballet. Yesterday he asked permission to see me. - What did you reply? - I said I would like to, but that you had the final say. He will talk to you next Sunday... at eleven, after mass. What did I do wrong, sister? I don't want you to have any distractions. First you have to finish school and graduate. The rest will come later. Maybe you will meet other young men as well... so that someday you can pick between them... the one to settle down and have a home with. Well, I practically just met him, but... Beatriz is like one of those spring mornings... that suddenly go directly to your heart. Without complications, pure, simple and perfect. I believe you son, but... you want to fly when you should go step by step. A pilot, alas. You abandoned this house, now you... want to finish it in a few weeks... as if you were in a hurry to get somewhere. I long for a home. A home with a woman exactly like Beatriz. Without complications, like... Like a spring morning, I heard you. But look, son. Besides the fact that Beatriz is almost a child... we know nothing about her sister... who after all, is like her mother. Tomorrow I'm going to meet her... after eleven o'clock mass at the cathedral. I get the feeling she is worthy. What the hell! In these selfish times... such a sacrifice as hers... acting as her mother, implies something serious. No doubt Mercedes is worthy. Very worthy, mother. For you, that's much. Well. Keep walking. I was wrong, yes. I know a pretty girl who walks so sweetly... Shall we dance, Mercedes? Go away, you know I want nothing with you. Come on, just a little dance. Let me go. She moves harder and they tell her to go. Well, well. A little step that way, a little step this way. A little step that way, a little step this way. - Give me a coke. - Right away. A nice little sway, cutie I want to see you enjoy. - A little step this way. - My little honey pie. - A little step that way. - What a little doll. - A nice little sway. - That's so good, honey. - A little step that way. - That way. Remem ber I said there was a deal that would make me rich? Well, I need your help tonight. Don't count on me. Look Mercedes, you and I need lots of dough. We'll have more than enough, we'll go away together... and live it up where nobody knows us. Let's leave all this behind to live the good life. I love you and promise I'll be a man. From now on, you'll be the only woman for me. I'm getting rid of all those dames. But first you have to help me. We'll be done with this in no time. Leave me alone, Paco, I want no part of your schemes. You're turning me down. That's like a curse on me. If anything goes wrong, it'll be your fault. A nice little sway. - A little sway, sway. - A little step that way. - That way, that way. - A little step this way. - My little honey pie. - A little step that way. A nice little sway, cutie, I want to see you enjoy. He threatened you again. He uses what he knows on me. Don't help him, he keeps very bad company. Tell me if he tries to blackmail you. I'm very tired, Lupe. I think I'll retire now. Tomorrow I'm meeting Beatriz's sweetheart. Not sweetheart yet, he's her suitor. Did I tell you he's a hero from Squad 201? A lieutenant pilot. Shall I walk you home? Yes, please. I'm sad and I am very scared. I don't know, I had never been this sad before. As if something were going to happen. Don't worry, Merceditas, I'll take you to your doorstep. Thank you, Lupe. A flower for the lady, officer. Look how difficult, straight from Veracruz. Come on, officer, don't be mean. - How much? - Fifty cents, for the lady. Fifty cents? All right, ten cents. I don't want you spending on me. Go on. - Take 20 for your funeral flower. - Gardenias, gardenias. Funeral. Let's throw it out, what if it's bad luck? No, no, those are just superstitions, aren't they? Over the roofs. Go that way, I'll go this way. Stop, you wretch. Let's go. Quiet, don't turn the light on. What's wrong, Paco? Don't involve me, please. I told you it would be your fault. Buddy. I'm the officer from the corner of the dance hall. I said I'm the officer from the corner of the dance hall. I'm bearing witness on behalf of somebody that was brought in. Mercedes Gòmez. One of the thieves... sneaked into her room at dawn... in an attempt to hide, that's why she was with him. - Mercedes Gòmez? - Yes, buddy. I'm sorry. You know nothing can be done on Sundays. She has a very important engagement... today at eleven o'clock. What, what? She has an important engagement... today at eleven o'clock. Don't get mad, buddy. The judge will be here tomorrow... at 10..30, at the earliest. It had to happen on a Sunday, tough luck. Then, let me see her. Huh? Let me see her. Sure thing, buddy. You know the way, don't you? I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. How could this terrible thing... happen precisely today? The judge won't come until tomorrow. You can't get out any sooner. There is no tomorrow for me. I'll never see Beatriz again. I wanted to talk about that. I could go see your sister and the lieutenant pilot. She knew perfectly what this meant to me. But of course, to her it's not important. She has stood me up so many times. For example, today, like most other Sundays. All the girls go out and I stay behind, alone. With all due respect, Miss Beatriz. I wouldn't talk that way about your sister. Precisely today. She didn't even bother to write me a letter. Always distant. Who knows where? No wonder they say my sister is so mysterious. Miss Beatriz, your sister... is working hard to make a living... so that you can attend this school. Who are you? I'm like her servant, Miss Beatriz. I help her in any way I can. She deserves so much. She wrote to me and asked me to excuse her... and to see if Mr. Roberto could meet her next Sunday. I'm leaving now. It's almost eleven, and the cathedral is far. Don't ever think those things about your sister. Your sister, Miss Beatriz... is more than a mother to you. Excuse me, lieutenant. Yes? - Are you Mr. Roberto? - Yes, why? My boss Miss Mercedes sent me to see you. She was unable to come to Mexico city today... but she will come next Sunday with her sister... for sure. Next Sunday? Where and what time? Right here, at the same time, lieutenant. - Thank you very much. - Excuse me. Listen, my friend. Please accept this. - Thank you very much. - Excuse me. What happened, Merceditas for christ's sake? - Somebody wanted my blanket. - Somebody took it. Okay, who took the blanket? That woman isn't the goddess you think. Shut your mouth. Quiet. I'm really sorry about what's going on, Merceditas. - Did you see my sister? - And the lieutenant, too. It's arranged for next Sunday. He'll be expecting you and your little sister. He must be a nice young man. Very nice and very impressive, like a marshal. You should have seen his uniform, olive colored, made of the finest English fabric, with his stripes... and gold wings. His car is this big, it sends off sparks. It's gorgeous. He must have thought I was a messenger, and tipped me. I'll keep the coins as a souvenir. I hope nothing bad happens before Sunday. What could happen? Be patient. Next Sunday you will see your sister and the lieutenant pilot. How can I ever repay you, Lupe? If I didn't already know that there's a God in Heaven... I would believe in Him because you exist. These are my buddies. Our arms. Our 201. Looks like we were in the sky. We were. Twenty minutes ago we were 3,000 meters up, weren't we? 3,700 meters. 3,700? Yes, Beatriz, 3,700 meters. It was like fleeing from the misery down here. As if the pureness of the sky filled me up. So close to the stars and to God. You have a wonderful profession, Roberto. And you are an angel... for only angels can rise to the sky. An angel? I don't know what to say. Ever since I was little I dreamt of flying. For me, any airman was like a god. Now I realize that... You can go up and breathe a bit of divinity. I like the solitude up there, among the stars. Up there, you can feel and think more clearly. You can grasp the important things in life a lot easier. Like.. Like the reply I am expecting from you, Miss Mercedes. I know how much Beatriz means... and how far you've gone for her. You are an admirable woman, Miss Mercedes. I speak with the conviction of my insignificance. Allow me to formalize our relationship under the condition... that it will not interfere with Beatriz's schooling. I love her, and I know we will be happy. I wish I could offer her a grand position, but... unfortunately, all I have is my profession... and a house I am finishing. I've been told I'm getting promoted. Excuse me if I hurt you in any way. I am unworthy of aspiring to something so grand. But when you're in love, Miss Mercedes, you lose your sense of reality. In the name of Heaven, I ask for lodging. The graduation test is done. Tomorrow I'll have my gown for the graduation party. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. Roberto wants to get married in 3 months. He even spoke of the honeymoon. He said they're going to Hawaii. Who knows how long. I don't know what I'll do. I could help her before when she was in school. But now, where will I put her in the meantime? You'll have to have a home she can leave from. Besides, the principal will want to discuss that. It'll be terrible for Beatriz, I should just die. Don't say that, Merceditas, I told you... and you know I meant it from my heart. I have some savings. And I'm working afternoons at the warehouse. Everything I make is yours, no conditions asked. Soon you will be free from your burden. And maybe someday you'll want to share your life with me. I won't mention this again... because I shall wait for you until the day God determines... You are so kind, Lupe. You still consider that... and I can still mean something to you. You can use me however you see fit. The only way is as my wife. Don't do that, don't do that, Merceditas. You have to leave this place as soon as possible... and present yourself... as what you are.. Miss Beatriz's sister. Oh, it is a queen... Who calls for us... How can she be all alone... at night? My wife is Mary... and she is going to give birth... to the Divine Being. Is that you, Joseph? I'll tell you one thing. Few christmas parties are as respectful as these. Here we are all sinners and do not smell incense. But don't see the devotion of the girls and the clients. And let me tell you, among them... there are some nasty fellows. One of the wise men spent five years in the dump. There is a girl who gets. I mean, seducing and stealing away from here. Because let me tell you, this is a decent place. We don't seduce or steal here. You won't see drunk women, either. Although we sell beer... there is a limit, you know. Joseph, Mary and Jesus came to honor us today. Throw candy and favors... for the youngsters' hearty appetite. And, going back to the girl... I wonder what she does with the dough. I mean, she's always broke. I'll introduce you to her now. - Waiter. - Yes, sir. Call Mercedes. Mercedes. Mercedes, Mercedes. - The boss wants you. - Excuse me. When copland was here, a musician, from your country. Yes, yes copland. Aaron copland, the composer of Salòn Mèxico. Exactly, Mr. copland sat at this very table. He spent nights watching and... getting the feel of the people. That's where he got the inspiration... to compose the Salòn Mèxico Suite. The suite. Hurry Mercedes, don't take long bring out the basket of peanuts. Hurry Mercedes, don't take long bring out the basket of peanuts. Mercedes come here, Mercedes. Mercedes, I am telling you to come. What the hell is it with you? Tell me, what's wrong? Either you go, or you're fired. I'd like to know why you steal... but you never have a penny? Tell me who's taking your money... so I can give him a beating. You heard me, don't ever set foot in here again. It's better that you were fired, Merceditas. Now you can't go back. What you should do is go get some rest. Forget what happened. Pretend this christmas Eve... never existed. Let's go. You should move as soon as possible. You need a place to live with Miss Beatriz. Tomorrow I'll move to any old place. You'll get rid of your fears once and for all. Yes Lupe, I'm going. See you tomorrow, Merceditas. And forget about everything. See you tomorrow, Lupe. Paco! Yes Mercedes, it's me. I got away from the cops. Here I am, waiting for you. You have to go away, don't compromise me. If you knew what I've been through. It was like being in hell. Well, where were you? Have pity on me, go away. On your mother's memory, for goodness sake. You're the only thing I want, only you. I fled thinking of you. - I came to get you. - No. Honey, let's cut the games. They're searching for me big time. Grab your clothes and let's go. We'll go to Guatemala right now. - You won't regret it. - No Paco. I'm as serious as if both of us were about to die. I love you and can't forget you. I am what I am, but I cannot forget you. I love you... Let go of me Paco, let me go. Over my dead body. I told you before that there... could never be anything between us. Go away, Paco, I'm begging you. I never want to see you again. You don't care about my love, you're not coming? No, don't worry, I won't kill you. You know where I'm going to strike. I read that your sister is marrying a hero. The son of the principal... of a fancy boarding school for girls. That's where I'll strike, before I leave Mèxico. No. Fate brought you here, you're not leaving this room. - Move or I'll kill you. - I said you're not leaving. I said move. I needed to talk to you, lieutenant. Take the body away. As soon as the autopsy is done, you can take her. She was going to be my wife. After Miss Beatriz and you got married. She was the greatest woman I ever met. Ana Luisa Romero. Miss Beatriz Gòmez. - My sister didn't come. - No, she did not. You know, she had to leave on a long journey. But you are coming with us. But now, I want to be the first to congratulate you. May I kiss you? Juàrez shouldn't have died, oh, have died... Juàrez shouldn't have died, oh, have died... If Juàrez hadn't died... things would have been different. The nation would have been saved, Mexico would be happy, happy.
