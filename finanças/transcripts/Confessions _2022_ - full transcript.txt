This film is a work of fiction based on a true story. I've hurt a lot of people. I have... a lot of history. But I considered myself a soldier. I followed orders. It was never personal. I'm a pro. Mind before the heart as they say. I rarely even knew my targets. A photo, an address, that's it. Staying calm, focused, detached. Eventually, things... fall into place. It's time, you know. The boss said this guy must go down, he went down. I was born in Chicoutimi in 1950. I hate her more than anyone on Earth. My mother. This has to stop. They're gonna hurt him. You're gonna call tomorrow. He's the oldest in his class. He should fight back. He might be older, but he's small. Enough, Lisette. Th-th-they... gang up on me. Wh-wh-why do you think? - Jacinthe, please. - You should be proud of your brother. He's mastering Grade 11, after being held back three times. Twi-twice. There's more to life than school. You can do plenty. This came today. "Dear parents, enclosed is your child's report card, as well as a copy of their OLSAT test results. According to the test, Gerald's IQ is 88, which is below average, near the low end of the bell curve below. This score would explain your son's severe learning difficulties." Why do that?! What's the point?! Just trying to toughen him up. So he won't become soft like some people! CONFESSIONS OF A HITMAN BRUSSELS - 2006 July 5, 2006. Brussels, Belgium. 10:47 a.m. This is being recorded, alright? Yes. As I explained, we have DNA evidence against you. On a bottle of beer and a coffee cup. So this case is considered closed. Now, do you understand what DNA evidence means? Pretty much. But you acknowledge that I fully explained the operation that yielded this evidence? Yes. I also explained you're suspected of committing several other murders over the course... of many years... ...here in Quebec, during what is commonly known as the Biker War. You said you'd worked for one of the leaders of the West End Gang, Réjean Deslauriers, and his lieutenant, Rod Lemay. You also worked as a hitman for Marc Larose, lieutenant of the Rock Machine in Quebec City. And you had accomplices in several of these murders, including Donald Lemaire, AKA Dolly. 28 murders in 25 years in Quebec and I get nabbed in Europe, darn it. I seem... I might seem cool, but... ...inside... ...I'm shaking. Say it's all true... I want to know what I'm in for, y'know? I'm 56. And... I've got... I've got... I've got a heart condition. Don't want to end up in a cardboard box. 'Cause... There will be a contract on my life. - Gerald-- - A big contract. If you come clean, tell us everything, we're duty-bound to protect you. Your wife, too. My wife. That woman... ...really doesn't deserve... what's gonna happen. Really not at all. I'll... ruin that woman. - How long have you been together? - I'll destroy her. They strapped me in for my court appearance in Fort Lauderdale. They've got this gizmo. You get riled up, they push the button. A thousand volts! Now that fuckin' makes you settle down! I wouldn't mind one of those. You wish, my love. Fuckin' Americans. Bastards are pretty damn efficient, though. All together now! For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny For he's a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny FREE DAMMIT! Here's to Dolly. Did five years and never snitched. No problem. Cheers. Didn't miss your hair salon? Ya think? Getting buggered by big tattooed guys must pass the time. Better than dickless wonders like you. So you had a close call. Major surgery. Yeah, but y'know... they... ...patched me up. Yeah? Show us. - What? - What, what? You drunk? Scars are sexy. - They're so manly. - Don't slide off your chair, honey. C'mon, Gerald. Does Dolly have to blow you? Really! We're eating. Supper's finished. No biggie. If you're not enjoying yourself, you... ...can wait in the living room. I'll wait in the car. Nasty. - Feisty. - Jeez, you giving it to her? You'll go by yourself, right? The way it works... we always go with an officer in such cases. You should go alone. - It's common practice. - 'Cause... she... y'know... You have to take it easy cause her blood pressure... y'know? It'll... skyrocket. The door. Hang on. I don't want sweetums here. Shut it. I trust Carlo more than you. Yeah, I'm with him on this. Hang back. Won't be long. Go. The West End Gang and the Rock Machine are joining forces against the damn Hells Angels. They're crazy, out of control. Bunch of psychos. They're encroaching on our territory. Fuckers are going down. Marc will need our services. They want war? It's on. We'll get those bastards. I want the top dogs. Full-patch members. Reg said you're his top man. I agree. I won't let you down. Given your surgery, take it easy. I'm good. I-I-I'm getting in shape. I'm cycling to stay fit. You and Dolly trust each other. You make a good team. Used to call 'em Siamese twins. Just know that he's got your back. Yeah. Don't be shy. Gotta get back in the game. We'll talk soon. I'll keep you posted. Say, Rod bought his house in '90, right? Maybe. Dunno. I know. He was broke then. His coke deal with the Mexicans fell through. Get to the point. She's been waiting an hour. I was busted in '90. And the bank offered a $40,000 reward. BURNABY - BRITISH COLUMBIA What's that asshole doing? The cops showed up at 7 a.m. They knew exactly where to look. $40,000 from the bank, $5,000 informant reward. Receipts. Forty grand. Hell of a down payment on a house, huh? Yeah, but... Rod's no rat. Then who? No way. Kid visited me every week for five years. No way. I'm not making accusations, but whoever ratted me out is a dead man. Yes and I'll be happy to help. But I gotta go. In that world, it's... everyone for themselves. Show no mercy. Don't ever embarrass me like that again. No worries. I'm never going back. How long have we been together? Hey! How long?! Watch it, Gerald. How did we meet?! Remember, dammit?! You wrote to me... when I was behind bars! You knew, y'know, I was no angel. And you married me! Yes. You're the one I married. - What's that mean? - I know what I mean. Well, you're the only one! Like it or not, those people are family. That's no family. Well, they trust me. Okay? It pays the bills. I don't want to know how. Y-y-you don't want to know, but... you're sitting pretty... in a big car... with your nice house and... ...big TV. Dammit! You want to kill me? Do you want to kill me? Darn it. Mr. Gerald Gallant? Mrs. Pauline Gallant reported a domestic disturbance. Your wife? Yes. She called from the neighbour's. Said she was scared to go home. Wh-wh-what? Why? You tell me. We had... ...a spat. We argued, but... that's it. She's safe? Yes. It's the first time... in 10 years. - Your husband said he didn't lay a hand on you. - He yelled at me. I was scared. It's okay now. - You'll be alright? - Sure. Sure? We never fight. I'm just not used to it. You don't call the cops. Ever. Understand? No more cops. I won't put up with violence. Ever. Understand? Yes. Okay, I... It's my fault. Let's go to bed and... tomorrow will be better, okay? - Yes. - Yes. Angina's better? Yeah, yeah... it's fine now. - Good night. - Good night. I loved Pauline. She was my rock. And our quiet little life was a good cover, too. What did the cops see earlier? An everyday couple who had a fight outside their little house. Perfect. But all that wasn't enough for me. I needed more. I'd found Jocelyn. She rode a bike. And I knew her route downtown and on bike paths. So I faked mechanical problems to meet her. She worked at her family's funeral home, but her real passion was cycling. Tuck in your legs, your knees. That's it. It's working. She agreed to train me as a cyclist. We had real chemistry, sports-wise. What you doing? Taking notes... about our rides. Today, we rode 72 kilometres... in three hours. A smiley face? Yeah. You know... I'm encouraging myself. You're... You're a strange guy. Huh? Well... The guys I've dated... ...came on strong the first night. That's... that's classless. With you, it's been two months. I... respect you. Well... That's all well and good, Gerald, but a girl starts wondering. When you put it that way... You want to disrespect me, don't wait so long. This is nice. Y'know... ...I-I wasn't always an angel. I saw that. I've done... some pretty shady things. Some... ...pretty wild stuff. I've done time. Prison time. T-t-twice. But you didn't, like, kill anyone? Yes, but no more than seven or eight. Thank God cause any more... No, but... ...like... bank robberies... A credit union in '80. Stuff like that. That... doesn't scare you, does it? I've been working at the funeral home 20 years. I pick up bodies too. Mostly old folks. Most clients are old folks who haven't lived. Ever. They never travelled. They bury their dead until it's their time. Only one thing scares me. Boredom. - Feeling okay? - Yeah. For real. Your heart. That's all behind me. Okay. Let's get to it. Name's Mario Vandesberghen. Full-patch member. Bastard's going down. There's his address and his favourite diner. Big, flashy guy with a moustache, rings and chains. Can't miss him. Rod said you like Magnums. Left one in a paper bag, under the big pine tree in the woods outside. And a. 38 for Dolly. - Don't need him. - This is war, Gerald. If the guy has backup, you're in deep shit. - But-- - I discussed it with Reg. He agrees. He mention my advance? We said 20 grand. Here's two. Thanks. Pampalon. Patron of alcoholics, drug addicts. Cures all addictions, apparently. What do you think? I... don't believe in that. Imagine. Damn! We'd go broke. I need a patch holder. Do a clean job. I won't forget it. Count on me. Pauline was making cabbage rolls for a charity with Sister Alice. I was packing for the job in Quebec City. Man... sure smells good in here. Right? Very good. I'm... heading out. You work weekends? Yes. - For the road. - Thanks. For every hit, I bought new threads. Then you get rid of it and leave no trace. I always took two guns, too. One for the hit, which I dumped, and another I carried for safety. - Hi. - Hi. Turning up like a bad penny. Y-you don't even bother sneaking around anymore? You slut! - Now, wait a minute. - You shut up. Lisette said you often abandon Dad. You haven't seen him in two years. You're one to talk. I couldn't come and you know it. Poor baby just got released from prison. Living in a halfway house now? Imagine, Ramsey. My son robs banks but is too stupid to get away with it. Get back in your clunker and piss off. No, I'm seeing my dad. Whatever. Just make sure you're gone when I get back at 10:00. Dad? Is that you, Gerald? Never thought I'd see you again. I was... released... two years early. Model prisoner, according to my file. And... I have... uh... some... some... some great news. I'm getting married this summer. What's her name? Pauline... Yeah... You love her? Dad. You've always had trouble committing. So? What do you think, you dirty dog? Ar-are you nuts? I could've shot you. Relax. It's my cover. Cover. Cover. Look, for 10 years, I've been using a ball cap and windbreaker. Works just fine. - How boring can you get? - That's the idea! That's the goal! We want to blend in. Step on it. I'll explain. - What? - It's a brand-new Chevy, not a trash can. I like it clean. Get used to it. And I'm the fag. The time we waste on recon. Find the guy, watch him, tail him. I can make this much easier and more cost-effective. With this alone, I can stroll over to fuckin' Vanden... Vanden's place, or whatever his fuckin' name is. He sees a woman, doesn't suspect fuck all. Good-looking blonde cheers him up. He opens the door... ...I pop him. Done and done. Twenty grand. Good riddance. We've... We don't know him from Adam. Big patch holder with a moustache. Can't miss him. What if it's not him? What if his wife comes to the door? What if he has kids? - So? - I don't want them seeing Dad's brain splattered! I have principles. And if you don't like it... ...get out. I'll handle it. Chill, poodle. That's your third one. - Keeps me awake. - Your diabetes. I've got insulin. By the way, I checked. Don't think it was Rod. - Huh? - Who ratted me out. He bought his house in '89, not '90, six months before the heist. And Carlo, no way. He's hot for me. Maybe someone at the bank... - ...identified you. - With my ski mask? Maybe you lifted it at one point. Sure. I had an itch and I took it off. If it's not Rod or Carlo, must be me. That's what Carlo keeps telling me. And what do you tell... little Carlo? That we've been like brothers since kindergarten. Our bond was sacred. If he ever said that again, he was a dead man. Look, relax. No need for that. It's just a scare tactic. I love that little shit. He's just not too savvy. A birdbrain. What the fuck?! Screw the wig. It's fuckin' itchy. What a night. We make a damn good team. What's wrong? You didn't have to hit her so hard. Women and children are off limits for me. She was in your way. No, no, I just needed a little time. She was batshit crazy. Couldn't risk it. I've done 15 jobs. All clean. Okay? I stick to the job. I don't leave any trace. You should do the same if you want to stay free. You're fuckin' lecturing me now? Bitch all you want. We both made a cool 10 grand tonight. Bitch, bitch, bitch. Finally, a patch holder! Here. That's nothing. This is just the beginning. About that... I'd like... a raise for the next ones. The war put a lot of guys away. Lawyers are costing us a fortune. That's all we can afford for now, but I can promise you one thing. When things blow over, Reg and me will take care of you and you'll be set for life. A fuckin' patch holder! A patch holder! Damn. Good. I should be home tomorrow. Can't wait to see you. Yeah. Okay. Bye. You're up late. After last night, I needed time to recover. Western omelet. Number one. BIKER WAR CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM Crazy world. Seems a man and a woman did it. Must be love, killing together. Yeah, or they're kind of... twisted. Dunno. Takes trust. Like Bonnie and Clyde. A movie. A movie about... ...a real guy who falls for a woman, and they rob banks together and... ...kill, too. How does it end? They get killed. But they're in love... and stick together. That's beautiful. Maybe, y'know... maybe you're a little twisted too. He looks like you. You can trust me. Larose gave me another job: whacking the Hells's lieutenant, Jerry Pratt. He was on parole, and probably staying at his dad's motel and staying in Jonquière. I asked Jocelyne if she wanted to come along. She agreed. The robberies, the hits, even my life with Pauline - I told her everything. I'd never opened up to anyone before. Larose had provided a photo of Jerry. I wanted to make sure I had the right guy. Jocelyne was gonna help me with that. Might be him. Sir? Pardon me. My husband and I were wondering, any good restaurants around? An Italian place on the way to Alma, near the Jonquière exit. Okay. Is Italian alright? - Where...? - Right off the Jonquière exit. Thanks so much. Good night. It's him? Let's get back to the woman we heard about, your alleged accomplice. Who is she? No, Claude. I'll help you out. She went on jobs with you. Jérôme "Jerry" Pratt, among others. Not that. If I give her up... ...I couldn't live with myself. Gerald, I need that name. That's the deal. Full disclosure. Otherwise, here's what's gonna happen. This conversation's over... and you'll have to rely on your lawyers. You don't understand. That... That woman... It's special. Y'know? I owe her a lot. Gerald, her name. ...the family, actress Marie-Soleil Tougas and film director Jean-Claude Lauzon died in a plane crash - ...on their way back from a trip... - When will you do it? ...yesterday afternoon, the couple's plane nosedived... I... I dunno, but not now anyway. When? Not while you're here, that's for sure. - Why not? - Stop. Besides... I don't have a weapon. - Y-you... - Well, no. I told you. We're here on... on... on a recon mission, to identify the guy. You helped out, did your part. Now it's my show. But y'know, I... ...I'll give you... two grand. It's not about the money. But you're getting it anyway. You're my Clyde. No. I'm your Bonnie. Clyde's the guy. Damn, that... sounds complicated. I went back to Jonquière soon after. Pratt went back to the motel every night at 11:00, and I was waiting. Motherfucker! C'mere! C'mere! Sonofabitch! Pratt survived, even after five rounds. But Larose paid me anyway. So I took a trip with Jocelyne. HAVANA - 2000 I see why I told Jocelyne everything. 'cause keeping all that inside really weighs on you. But the real question is, why did I take her to Jonquière? I think I know the answer. Now that we were accomplices, she couldn't rat me out without implicating herself. I was ashamed. You believe? Dunno. I talk to him. Like my dad, now that he's gone. But now I talk to you. Her name. - I know it's hard. - No. No, you don't. 'Cause if you knew, you wouldn't ask. If... I give her up, I've got nothing left. Y'know? It'd be like selling my soul. - I don't feel so good. - Gerald, I won't ask you again. Once and for all: No. - I-I don't feel well. - What's the matter? Something's wrong. - Really not feeling well? - No. - Need an ambulance? - Yes. What's it like? Y'know, your hits, when they look at you just as... How does it feel? You don't... you don't want to know. - Yes, I do. I need to know-- - No! - You don't. - Okay. - Sorry. - It's okay. Besides, I'm almost done with that stuff. The boss mentioned a big job. Like the jackpot. Who? He didn't say, but he gave me a number. And... it's a good one. We could start a business, y'know? A small business down south, uh, in the islands. I like... flowers and... and plants. You like flowers? GLACIER LAKE - NEW BRUNSWICK The boss took us to a hunting camp. He wanted us to practice for a coming hit, and try out a bunch of weapons. Fuckin' machine guns keep jamming. - Who's our supplier? - The Russian. Fuckin' swindler. My shoulder's fu-fu-fuckin' killing me. Remingtons have a hell of a kick. It's a 12 gauge. My hands are still shaking. 'Cause you're not used to 12 gauges. Uzis have more recoil. Yeah? Your shoulder okay, sweetie? I'm all good, but my finger's stiff. Nasty. She on the rag? Relax, boys. Gerald, wasn't your dad from around here? - Yes-- - Yeah, his dad was Chiac. Dad was... Acadian, y'know. The dialect was Chiac, an Acadian French dialect. Chiac, shmiac. What a lame language. Makes no sense. They sound like morons. Right. 'Cause you're so eloquent. Damn, you trying to piss me off? You gonna lay off? Sweetums can't hold his own? - You done? - You fuckin' done? - What's your fuckin' problem? - Shut it! - Shut the fuck up! - You fuckin' shut it! Are you fuckin' done? Boys! Listen up. We got business. This war's gotta end. We've been hitting back hard, making a big dent, but it's never enough. We've lost some big players too. But now, enough is enough. We'll fight fire with fire. We're gonna destroy the Hells. Maurice "Mom" Boucher... Fucker's a dead man. About time, dammit! We'll wipe that smug smile off his face! Can't stand his fuckin' spiky hair anymore! Bang!! Yessir, Sasquatch, I'll drink to that! Alright!! - Not drinking, girly-girl? - Lay off. I've had enough. - Enough? We're gonna whack Mom, dammit. Drink up. - Hey... I said no! - Come on! - I said no, dammit! Jeez, is that fudge-packer with the Hells? Say that again, asshole. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Enough. You would swing both ways, huh? Fuckin' fag. Who's the fag now?! Who's the fudge-packer now, huh?! Think he got it. You've known Rod 30 years. You've never had a problem. I do now. See how he's been acting? Always after Carlo, provoking him 24/7, the bastard. I agree. We obviously have a problem. Finally. Thanks, Reg. But Rod's not the problem. I... can't work like this. Y'know, we need... we need some team harmony. Especially now. It's not Carlo's fault. It's mine. It's my fault. I shouldn't have let you bring him. Just keep him away from the gang. Tell me you're on board. Donald... It's important. I understand. I'll talk to Rod, bury the hatchet between you two. Burying the hatchet okay with you? Sure. Thanks, boss. You can go. You need to go, alright? I didn't have the heart to do it. I figured scaring him would be enough. So he'd stay away and keep quiet. Biggest mistake of my life. BRUSSELS - 2006 Alright, Gerald? Look at me. Look at me. You alright? Hang in there, Gerald. We're almost there. They'll take care of you, okay? How you feeling? Thought you were better since you took up cycling. I won't make it in prison, Claude. Help me. We'll do everything we can... ...if you do too. Seems to me I'm doing everything I can. There's a big piece missing. You know that. It's hard, y'know. It's... a sensitive subject. You can tell me. A lot of people will get hurt, Claude. We did a lot to save you, you know? The ambulance, security, doctors, hospital room, nurses... It's not cheap. Doctor said you're perfectly healthy, with the heart of a 40-year-old. Stop jerking me around. Stop wasting my time. Jocelyne Lacroix. She helped me, uh... with Jerry Pratt, uh... Ghislain Allard and, uh... ...Rivard. Help you how? The only one responsible... ...for everything the young lady did, is me... y'know? She's from a good family, y'know, hard-working people, honest people. And it'll... ...hurt them. Get dressed. What? Body pick-up. That's my call. We'll let you know. Ma'am, we'll let you know. Move along. Yeah. BIKER WAR - MURDER IN DONNACONA Looks a hell of a lot like you. What were you doing there? My job. Couldn't find someone to sub for you? Didn't know it was you. You never tell me anything. - What's it matter anyway? - You're pushing it. This is my business, okay? I don't want you there. That's not how I operate. - You got me involved. - My mistake, yeah. I'm part of your life. All of it. Trust, remember? Open up. Or you'll die alone. I'm all in. Jocelyne was starting to push it. But the hit on Mom Boucher was going down on September 13, and I had to plan it. This is... the salon where he gets his hair done on Wednesdays. Little bitch. And this here's... the pub where... y'know, he has a beer. Across the street is a chip shop. That's where I did my stakeout. And we crossed paths once. - If I'd been armed, I could've whacked him then. - And have us miss out? Sausage, anyone? - No, thanks. - Thanks. If you ask me, the simplest course of action... is Dolly and I go... to the restaurant, have, y'know, a nice relaxing lunch, and wait for him to... head to the salon. When he crosses... ...Pie-IX Boulevard... we whack him. Carlo... Where's he at? Yeah, he moved away. We broke up. Take your time with the muffin. He doesn't usually show up till 11:00. I need my breakfast or my head spins. By the way... Boss is working on a coke deal. We're a man short. I don't mess with drugs. You know I hate that. But it's 750 kilos. Big score. It's all set. A nice sailboat trip down south. Where? Venezuela... via Porto Rico. - Puerto... not Porto. - That's what I said. You'll get half my cut. What did I do to deserve that? Let him be, okay? Stay away. - Who? - Don't play with me. You know. Carlo. Tell the boss to call it off. Focus. Pretend we're chatting. So how are the hemorrhoids? What the fuck? That was due to the attempted murder of Auger, the journalist. What kind of moron does that? Journalists are off-limits. Besides, they'd used a. 22, a stupid peashooter. Auger's case is causing an uproar. Not good. Cops are cracking down on the Hells. Can't whack anyone anymore, so forget it. You know me, Reg. I can slip through the cracks... easy. Game's changed. We're meeting the Hells Sunday. War's over. Don't worry. We promised we'd take care of you. We keep our promises. Huh? I'm looking for a helper. A hard worker. No more trips. No more retirement down south and special plans with Jocelyne. I'd just bought a brand-new Chrysler 300 with my almost-maxed-out credit card. My world was crumbling. And hers too, poor girl. You... don't feel anything anymore? That's... just how it is. Well that doesn't happen overnight. It's out of my control, y'know. I have nothing left... to give. Nothing. You realize? Everything I gave up for you? Everything I put up with, everything... All the risks I took. You realize? I know. I... Thanks. Thanks? Thanks for... Y'know, we did take... some nice trips together. And, uh... I did spend a lot of money... Money?! I never asked for anything. I have a job! You always insisted on paying! You can't do it. Thought you were better than that. Thought I could help you, but... You're so weak. You're scared. Scared of commitment, scared of me, scared of everything and everyone. As soon as things get a little... ...complicated or... you run away. You're nothing but a coward, Gallant. I hope you get what you deserve: dying alone in a hellhole with your conscience - if you have one. I know you're angry... ...but don't do anything stupid. Some things have to stay... between us. Because you were an accessory. You're guilty in the eyes of the law. Never forget that. My cut. I was saving for our future. Take it and go. Go. - No. - Go. - I-I can't take this-- - Just get out! Go. Get out! Asshole. Asshole. I want protection, or forget it. Tell me who. There's a bounty out on me. I want assurances. I understand, but... we're gonna need a name. Gérald Gallant. Been working with the Rock Machine 15 years. Why should we believe you? I can't get a good night's sleep. Either I off myself or go on a killing spree. Or... rat him out. Gallant... seems harmless, but he's a snake. He plays everybody. He's cold-blooded. Likes to kill. Vandesberghen, full-patch Hells Angel - that was Gallant. "The Kid" Lemay - Gallant. Ghislain Allard, Yves Pednaud, Vince Davioli, Moses Lester - Gallant whacked them all. And a bunch of others. At least 15. And I'm next. It's just nerves. Perfectly normal. You're brave. It's not easy. One more question, okay? Does Gallant work alone, or with a partner? Alone. Sure? Absolutely. - When did it happen? - This morning. The boss had just gotten busted for the coke deal down south. Cops had been tailing him 18 months... ...since I talked. I think, y'know, we'll have to... ...disappear for a while. If you need to talk... ...use this. 'Cause... your land line... forget it. Except for ordering Chinese food. You don't look well. I'm fine. Your ex-boyfriend... seems he left some stuff behind. You don't tell him much, right? Told you to be careful. Get my insulin from the bedroom, would you? I can't sleep, can't eat, nothing! I can't take it anymore! I understand. I told them nothing about you. - You believe me, right? - 'Course. - I had no choice! No choice! - I know. Just calm down. I know, I know, okay? Sit down. Easy. Breathe. Breathe. That's it. Again. Alright. Better? Yeah. Your hair's a mess. There. Now you look pretty. I love you. It'll be okay. Listen carefully. Listen. We'll sort this out, okay? Everything works out in the end. Always. - Don't worry. I'm here. - I'm so sorry. I didn't want-- It's fine. It's all over. All over. Drink some water. You'll feel better. It's all good. Here. Thanks. That careful enough? The damage was done. Because of Carlo, they tied me to a hit in St-Adèle. That night, I screwed up bad. I was always very careful to leave no trace. I always took any cutlery I used. I usually ate with my hands, never leaving anything behind. But that night, Dolly was late, and you can't sit at a bar forever without drinking. People... might start to wonder. What the hell?! I don't even like beer. I just took a sip. It doesn't take much. A little saliva and they can practically tell what you had for dinner last Christmas. Hi. Hi, honey. Got... anything to eat? I haven't had dinner. Lisette called. Yeah? Your mother... What'd she want? She died today. She went softly while sleeping. Brandy? Sure. Bitch didn't even suffer. I swore I'd never go to her funeral. But I did, just to see them put her in the ground. I went to see her shortly before she died. I won't be here much longer... I'd like to tell you I love you. We're mother and son. I'm compelled to love you. Naturally. But I can't. I instinctively shrink from... ...physical contact, unlike with others. Revulsion, I'd call it. There's no other way to put it... You disgust me. Your complexion, your smell... Beady eyes. Even as a child... ...a baby, you disgusted me. You're sitting there and... You're soft, just like your father. A wuss, a moron... Can't say two words without tripping over your tongue. Beige. That's what you are. You're bland, colourless. Sorry, but that's all I see. There's a lot... you don't see, Mom. It hadn't... it hadn't gone so well. After Carlo talked, the cops put me under surveillance. I figured. I tried to be careful, but... you can't keep that up 24/7. Subject is leaving. Cup's clean. Good. Collect it now. They didn't bust me right away. Even let me fly off to Europe. I was broke then. $72.94 in my bank account, $45,000 in debt. But I'd found... a very lucrative gig. You dress up as a wealthy businessman and buy expensive stuff with cloned credit cards. $100,000 in five days. Easiest job ever. 11,500 euros, sir. Here. - Thank you, sir. - My pleasure. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Gerald A little something for your 56th birthday. Th-th-th-that's real nice of you, but, uh... I don't drink. It's alcohol-free, but, uh... that's not the real gift. Pleasure, Gerald. Pleasure, uh... miss. Well, I'll leave you to it. Take good care of him. He's in good hands. Happy birthday. When they took me back to Montreal, Pauline knew I'd been arrested, but not about the 28 murders yet. The Quebec City daily called. They know you're talking to us. It'll make the front page tomorrow. My wife! They know wh-where I live! - We're on it. - You need to get her out! Don't worry. I'm scared. Listen carefully... Pauline. This is real important. The people I worked with... they're... they're very dangerous people. I know I always told you no cops, but... but you can trust these guys. Is it true? What? The 28 murders. Yes. They put her in witness protection. New name, address, city. On the 28 counts of murder he is charged with, how does the defendant plead? Guilty, Your Honour. On the 12 counts of attempted murder he is charged with, how does the defendant plead? Guilty. I apologize for the pain... ...I caused my victims... ...and their families. I understand forgiveness will be difficult... ...if not impossible, and I... understand. The reason... The reason... The... the reason I'm... ...cooperating with the police... ...is... is... is to make up for... some of the harm done. I'm sorry. That's all. I signed a cooperating-witness plea agreement. I told the police everything over three years. I gave up my whole crew. You must have something to tell me. It's been three hours. I haven't heard a peep. I'm just trying to understand. I know you're no criminal. That's how you want to play it? Fine. Seeing these composite sketches in the paper... ...is scary. There's something missing. Inhuman. Well... You want to understand Gallant? That's him. Nothing more. How are you? Where are you living? Can't say. Yeah, yeah, that's... that's best. I need... your help. Y-you have to talk to them. Tell them, y'know, I was a... a good husband. - Uh... tell them ab-about my childhood-- - I lost everything, Gerald. - About my mother. - My house, town, friends, name, identity. You cost me everything. But uh, me? Look at me. You? You're an assassin, the worst killer in Quebec history, according to the news. You belong here. No, I'm a soldier! It's different. We were at war! The men I killed were public enemies. We should thank you? I came to return this. Take it. I remember... when I gave it to you. I'd just gotten out of prison and... ...we were... at Marie-Antoinette. We'd ordered steaks this thick. Did you love me? At all? I'll always love you. You and me... ...it's... for better or worse. So... we have to stay united. Stay strong. St-Cyr respects you. He told me so. You need to... Wh-what are you doing? Go to hell, Gerald. I've hurt a lot of people. I have... a lot of history. But I considered myself a soldier. Pauline said... you... forgive the repentant. Th-th-that's what I am. A repentant sinner. You're all I have left. I don't want to end my days alone in a hellhole. Give me a sign. Lord. Gerald Gallant is serving 48 life sentences without the possibility of parole. He is being held in isolation in a secret detention facility. At best, he would be released at age 83. You weren't in touch with her? No. Some might find it hard, what I'm about to say... Well... I didn't... I didn't... attend her funeral. It was my decision. I felt better that way. Okay.
