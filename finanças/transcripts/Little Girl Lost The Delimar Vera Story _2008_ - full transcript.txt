THEN YOU HAVE A FUND DRIVE FOR THE ADULT SERVICES PEOPLE. YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE HOTEL-- REMIND ME I HAVE TO CALL THAT GUY JIM BEFORE I GO.

SHE WAS TOLD BY THE FIREMAN THAT THE BODY WAS TOTALLY INCINERATED. WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT THERE. A FIRE THAT SIZE WOULD ONLY BURN UP TO 1600°. REMEMBER THE FORENSICS ON THAT TELLCO WAREHOUSE FIRE? YEAH. I MEAN, A BODY WOULDN'T INCINERATE AT THAT TEMPERATURE. NOT EVEN A BABY. IT'S JUST PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. HMM. AND YET, SUPPOSEDLY, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT'S YOUR GUT ON THIS? WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS WOMAN SHOWS UP WITH THIS STORY... IT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPLAUSIBLE. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THERE'S EVEN A CHANCE THAT SHE'S RIGHT, THAT SHE JUST FOUND HER KID AFTER SIX YEARS OF WHAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH? I THINK I OWE IT TO HER TO FIND OUT. OKAY. WE'LL BITE. EXCELLENT.

THAT WAY, THAT CRAZY MUJER WILL LEAVE US ALONE ONCE AND FOR ALL. SI. IS THE CHILD HERE? SHE IS. SHE'S UPSTAIRS. SHE'S GETTING PRETTY FOR YOU. I TOLD HER WE WERE CASTING FOR A COMMERCIAL SO SHE WOULDN'T BE SCARED. THAT'S FINE. I'LL GO GET HER. HERE. LOOK AT THIS. IT IS THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF THE CHILD. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT YOURSELF. AALIYAH ANN SANTOS-- BORN DECEMBER 5TH. PARENTS-- VALERIE VALLEJA AND BRIAN SANTOS. SHE SHOWED ME THIS AFTER THE CRAZY MUJER MADE THE SCENE AT OUR PARTY. YOU SHOULD BE ARRESTING HER. I WAITED SO LONG... AND NOW WHAT I PRAYED FOR IS FINALLY COMING TRUE, BUT-- BUT WHAT? [EXHALES DEEPLY] [GULPS] WHAT IF I'M WRONG? [SOBS] WHAT IF DELIMAR IS NOT THAT LITTLE GIRL? WHAT IF... WHAT IF I KNOW MY LITTLE GIRL IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE? [SOBS HEAVILY] I'LL BE LOOKING FOR MY LITTLE BABY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

VALERIE AND I WERE GOING OUT, BUT AFTER SHE GOT OUT OF JAIL, I TOLD HER, I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER NO MORE. YOU KNOW, NOT SERIOUSLY. AND THEN SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH MY BABY. I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER. BUT SHE KEPT CALLING, YOU KNOW, BEGGING ME TO GET BACK TOGETHER, SAYING WE SHOULD BE A FAMILY. I FELT SORRY FOR HER. THEN ONE NIGHT SHE CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE'S PREGNANT AND SHE'S BLEEDING AND SHE'S LOSING THE BABY. BUT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE HER? WHAT, ABOUT THE PREGNANCY? WELL, YOU WERE SEXUALLY INTIMATE WITH HER, RIGHT? YEAH, BUT SHE HAD HER TUBES TIED TWO YEARS BEFORE THAT. I PAID FOR IT. OKAY? THERE'S NO WAY THAT SHE WAS HAVING ANY BABY. [KNOCK AT DOOR] [CLICKS RECORDER OFF] WAIT HERE. ANYTHING? IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. SHE HAD A TUBAL LIGATION. BIRTH CERTIFICATE DOESN'T ADD UP EITHER. THE STATE REGISTRAR SAID SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO PRESENT THE BABY TO GET THE CERTIFICATE, ONLY AN AFFIDAVIT. DID YOU GET A COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT? NO, THEY SAID THEY MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY DESTROYED THE ORIGINAL. OH, THAT'S GREAT. BUREAUCRACY IN MOTION. I'M GOING TO RELEASE HIM. OKAY. PEDRO, PLEASE? THIS HAS TO BE DONE. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT VALERIE HAS OUR BABY... [HUFFS] ...YOU WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME, WILL YOU? [EXHALES HEAVILY] [♪] [ALL CHUCKLING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] [RINGING] [PHONE BEEPS ON] HELLO?

OVER HERE! HOW DID IT FEEL TO SEE YOUR DAUGHTER AFTER SIX YEARS? HOLD ON. NO, NO. LUZ! LUZ! HOW DID IT FEEL-- [ALL CLAMORING, OVERLAPPING AND INDISTINCT] [BARRAGE CONTINUES] LUZ CUEVAS JUST HEADED INTO THE COURTHOUSE WITH HER ATTORNEY TO MEET WITH THE JUDGE WHO WILL OFFICIALLY RULE ON THE CUSTODY OF HER YOUNG DAUGHTER, DELIMAR VERA. CUEVAS KNEW IN HER HEART THAT HER DAUGHTER WAS ALIVE, AND, AGAINST ALL ODDS, CLUNG TO HER MOTHER'S INTUITION WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD LISTEN. TODAY, HER PERSISTENCE AND DETERMINATION HAVE PAID OFF. PHILADELPHIA LAWMAKERS WILL INVESTIGATE MEMBERS OF THE POLICE, FIRE, AND MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE TO FIND OUT HOW THE SYSTEM FAILED HER SIX YEARS AGO. IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING, THIS MOTHER NEVER GAVE UP HOPE. MS. CUEVAS, I AM RECOMMENDING THAT YOU MEET WITH DELIMAR IN A NEUTRAL PLACE FOR A FEW TIMES BEFORE-- I CAN'T TAKE HER HOME WITH ME? YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS TIME TO ADJUST. SHE DOESN'T KNOW YOU ARE HER MOTHER. I WILL TEACH HER. I HAVE WAITED FOR SO LONG. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME WAIT ANOTHER MOMENT. PLEASE. I APPRECIATE YOUR URGENCY, MS. CUEVAS. I KNOW YOU HAVE ENDURED FOR SIX YEARS MORE HARDSHIP AND GRIEF THAN MOST PEOPLE COULD HAVE TAKEN FOR A MONTH. AND NOW I AM ASKING YOU TO WAIT A FEW MORE DAYS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR CHILD. LET HER MEET YOU GRADUALLY. GIVE HER THIS TIME, AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE HER FOREVER. PEDRO. HI. I, UM... I SAW YOU ON THE TELEVISION. WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME? WHEN THE TIME WAS RIGHT. ARE YOU... TRYING TO KEEP ME AWAY? LUZ, I'M HER FATHER. I, UM... [SIGHS] I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU. YOU WERE RIGHT. ALL I ASK IS FOR A CHANCE TO BE A PART OF HER LIFE. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FORGIVE ME? PLEASE? [TELEPHONE RINGING] [GLORIA]: ANGEL CRUZ'S OFFICE. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? MAY I TAKE A MESSAGE? I'VE TOLD AALIYAH THAT SHE IS GOING TO MEET YOU. SHE IS CONFUSED AND WANTS TO KNOW WHEN HER MOMMY'S COMING BACK FOR HER. SHE MEANT VALERIE. FINDING HER WAS THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE. IT'S STRANGE THAT IT'S THE SADDEST DAY OF HER LIFE. [CHUCKLES SADLY] [INHALES SHARPLY] IT WOULD BE BEST, FOR NOW, IF LUZ CAME IN ALONE. WE DON'T WANT TO OVERWHELM HER. [EXHALES HEAVILY] [DOOR SHUTS] AALIYAH? ARE YOU READY TO MEET THE LADY I TOLD YOU ABOUT? DID I DO SOMETHING BAD? NO. NO, MI AMOR, YOU ARE A VERY GOOD GIRL. YOU'RE THE LADY FROM THE PARTY. I REMEMBER YOU. YES. I REMEMBER YOU, TOO. FROM A LONG TIME AGO. I USED TO WATCH YOU SLEEP. UH-UH. I DID. AND I WOULD STARE AT YOU AND WATCH THE WAY YOUR EYES WOULD FLUTTER WHEN YOU WOULD WAKE UP. WHEN? [LAUGHS] WHEN YOU WERE VERY LITTLE...

THERE'S SOMEONE UPSTAIRS WHO WANTS TO MEET YOU, TOO. DO I GET TO KEEP HER? OH, YES! SHE HAS WAITED A LONG TIME FOR YOU TO COME BACK. HOW LONG? YOUR WHOLE LIFE. YOU SLEPT WITH HER WHEN YOU WERE A BABY. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE WAS SO SCARED BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT YOU HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HER. BUT WE TOLD HER NOT TO LOSE HOPE. YOU WOULD COME BACK. YOU KNOW WHAT? WHAT, MI VIDA? I DON'T THINK SHE'S SCARED ANYMORE. UNO... DOS... TRES... CUATRO... CINCO... SEIS... SIETE, OCHO, NUEVE... DIEZ! READY OR NOT, HERE I COME! I SAW YOU! BUT YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!
