(silence) (slow, ominous music) (birds twittering) - Brenda, you know I brought you up here for a reason. - What's that? - Today's our 90-day anniversary! You know, since we first met? - That's really sweet that you remembered. It's been a really nice time. - Nice? - You know what I mean. - I care about you so much. - I feel the same way, honey. I feel like you gave me a new start. Thank you. It's been a really long time since I've felt this cared about. - (sighs) There's somethin' I gotta share with you. It's this group of friends, this group of friends I belong to. I'd like you to belong, too; I think it'll make us closer. - (chuckling) Hey, so serious; your friends are my friends. (crowd murmuring) (eerie music) - Why is everyone dressed in black? - Part of the ceremony, you'll see. (ominous music) - I see we have a newcomer amongst us this evening. Let us welcome her. (eerie music) Very good, very good. And now, let the ceremonies begin. (woman sobbing) (chains jingling) Thank you, gentlemen. (woman sobbing) (woman screaming) (onlookers chanting) Yes, yes. - No. (sobbing) No. - Oh my God. - [Dispatcher] Calling units (speaking faintly), heard a man screaming and saw some (speaking faintly) (woman gasps) - Yes, yes. (breathing heavily) Yes. (onlookers chanting) (door bangs) - Everybody freeze! You, get away from her. (woman sobbing) (smoke bomb bangs) (suspenseful music) (footsteps clattering) (sirens wailing) (eerie music) (woman sobbing) (chains jingling) - I was just walking home and they threw something over my head. I didn't even see them coming. (weeping) Those people almost killed me. Please, I just wanna go home. - You're gonna go home in just a minute, Lynn. Hold on, tell me something, you think you can identify any of these people? - (sighs) It was dark, I couldn't see any of their faces. - All right; okay. (typewriters clacking) - Oh my God, that's her! She's one of them. (suspenseful music) - Okay, gentlemen, you can go, thank you. It's all right, just, relax. - Look, I told you everything. It was my boyfriend, he took me there without telling me anything. - Why do I find it so hard to believe that he would just take you there out of the blue, huh? - I had no idea where he was taking me! - Yeah, well, we checked out your boyfriend. - And? - It's a phony name, there's no such person. - What are you telling me, that he was lying to me for the past three months? - Well, right now, it seems like you're the only one that's doing any lying here, Brenda. Right now, we have a woman here that will ID you positive from bein' there. - Of course she will, I was there! Detective, I don't know who these people were, but I'm not one of them! - Well, maybe you are, maybe you aren't, but if you're innocent, you're gonna wanna help us, right? - Yes. - All right. - What can I do? - Tell us where your boyfriend lives. Come on, what are you protecting the guy for, huh? I mean, if he's the sweet, innocent fella you say he is, then he's got nothin' to worry about. (eerie music) - Okay. - All right. (insects chirring) - It's the left one on the third floor. (eerie music) (candle holder clatters on floor) (flames crackling) (explosion booming) (eerie music) (glass shards clattering) (suspenseful music) (ominous music) (eerie music) (soft, eerie music) (ominous music) (eerie choral music) (eerie instrumental music) I haven't seen him since that night at the meeting. I don't even know his real name. - Do you think he died in the explosion? - No, I hate to admit it, but I think he planned the whole thing from the day we met. That son of a bitch is out there someplace, and they're holding me for withholding evidence. - Are you? - Oh, great, you too now? I have told them everything I know. Haven't you been listening to me? - Okay, okay, take it easy, all right? I didn't mean anything by it. What's your attorney say? - They haven't appointed me a public defender yet. They don't exactly move like greased lightning around here. - (sighs) I know. - Hey, I'm sorry I snapped at you. (ominous music) (bars clanking) (people speaking faintly) (guard clears throat) - Somebody's here to see you. Get movin'. (door clanks) - Excuse me? - Miss Carter? Hi, I'm John Stockton, criminal defense attorney. Why don't you have a seat? Come on, have a seat. Can I call you Brenda? Well, Brenda, I have been goin' through your case all morning here, and I think you're innocent. I'd like to help you. Do you understand what I'm saying, Brenda? I'm on your side. - I'm sorry, I just find it real hard to trust anybody right now. - Well, that's understandable, but between you and me, you gotta trust somebody, right? (chuckling) Now it says in the police report here that you didn't know any of the names of the cult members, is that accurate? - Yes, I mean, obviously Carl wasn't Carl, and I never heard any of the other ones called by name. - Well, is it possible that your boyfriend might've had a phone book with their names in it? - (scoffs) I don't know, I mean, if he did, it was probably lost in the fire. - I see. Brenda, I want you to look me in the eyes and tell me you have no idea what Carl was into. - I didn't know, I swear to God I didn't know. I thought I knew Carl, but I didn't know shit. - I believe you. Brenda, if I were to post bail for you, you have a place to stay? - No, everything that I owned was lost in the fire. - I understand. Listen, I got an offer for you, all right? You don't have to accept it, and I'll still represent you. I got a feeling you've had a lousy break, and this isn't the first time, right? So what do you say you come and stay with me? I've got a large house, I live alone, I'm never there. You can have your own room with a lock on the door, huh? Look, I used to be a probation officer here, all right? You ask around, they'll vouch for me. (chuckling) I mean, I've been doin' this all my life, pickin' up stray cats and takin' 'em home. No offense. - None taken. - Good. So? - Are you sure it wouldn't be an inconvenience? - Oh, hell no, no, not at all. So I tell you what, I'll post your bail and get you outta here by tonight, how's that? - Thanks. (soft music) - You're welcome. - Good news. - What happened? - There's an attorney who's agreed to take my case and post my bail. - God, that's great. - Yeah, maybe things are starting to look up. - Maybe. (gentle instrumental music) (locker door clanks) (door latch bangs) (dramatic music) - Get away from me. - [Guard] Is that so? - I'm gonna scream. - No, you won't! (Brenda cries out) You have no power. - Stop! (Brenda sobbing) - You have no power here! No power here. - Stop! (sobbing) No! No! (sobbing) No! No! (sobbing) Stop! (Brenda sobbing) No! (sobbing) Stop! No! (Brenda sobbing) (eerie music) No! (sobbing) (eerie choral music) No! No! (sobbing) (ominous music) (Brenda sobbing) - That's just a little something for you to remember me by when you're on the outside. (Brenda sobbing) (somber music) - Oh my God, what happened to you? - (sobbing) He raped me. - Oh my God, I'm sorry. Do you want me to get the warden? - No, I just wanna get dressed and I wanna go home. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. (Brenda sobbing) - What is in your hand, what is this? - I pulled it off him in the struggle. (sobbing) It looks like a medallion Carl used to carry. (sobbing) I think it's from the cult. - Oh my gosh, then this guard is part of 'em? - I don't know, but if he is, we can't let him know we know. - We? - Rachael, you have to stick with me on this one. I need you, you're on the inside, and I need you to watch him for me. (sobbing) - I hate that asshole. Okay, I'll try, okay? I'll do what I can. (Brenda sobbing) Okay. - You are accused with betrayal of your peers. How do you plead? - I have done nothing wrong. - My dear, you do not realize the petulance of your crime. It bears a heavy weight. - But I am not guilty. - Not guilty, not guilty? In your mind's eye, you are not guilty, yet in eternity's eye, you are! And now, you pay. (dramatic music) (people screaming) - [John] How's it goin', kiddo? - Pretty good. - Well, you keep at it, who knows, you might be able to come up with something we can use for your defense. And don't stop until you've written down every single detail you can remember. - I'll do my best. - Good, well, I'm outta here, I gotta go to work. I'll see you later this evening. - Mr. Stockton? - Yeah? - I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate everything. - Well, you're welcome; you call me John, Brenda. - Okay, John. - All right, Brenda. (Brenda simpers) So long, sweetie. - The first time I noticed something unusual about Carl was the time we were in bed together. I didn't think much of it then. I thought he was just a little odd. Are you glad I moved in with you? - It'll take some getting used to. - You look like your mind is someplace else. - Mm, I was just thinking. - Oh yeah? About what? - If I asked you to do somethin', anything I asked you, would you do it? - (chuckling) Well, that depends. - Would you, uh, would you drip candle wax on me? (Brenda chuckling) - Are you serious? (soft music) Won't it hurt? - No, it's really pleasurable. - I don't know. - Go on, come on, do it. (tense music) (Carl gasps ) (Carl moans) (ominous music) (eerie music) (birds twittering) (doorbell ringing) - Did you forget something? Carl! (tense music) what are you doing here? - That's not important. I heard you were thinkin' about writing about me. I don't think that's a very good idea. - What are you talking about? Why did you leave me, didn't I mean anything to you? - If I thought you would have accepted us, I would've brought you with me. - Accepted you? What kind of a relationship do you think we would have had? What did you wanna do, get married on Halloween? - I didn't think you'd understand. I brought you there as a test, and you failed. - And what about your apartment? I went by there the other night. - I didn't want any loose ends. - What do you want from me? - Be careful. What you say, what you write, it could hurt a lot of people. - I'll do what I have to to protect myself. - You do what you have to, one of those people that might get hurt may be you. (ominous music) I'll keep in touch. (women cheering and clapping) - Knock 'em dead! (women speaking faintly) - [Brenda] Hi there. - You want something? - Yeah, I noticed a medallion you were wearing, and I was wonderin' where you got it. - I just lost it today, what do you know about it? - Nothing, I was just admiring it earlier and thought you could tell me where you got it. - What are you getting at? - Well, I was watching the news and I saw those people obsessed with cults-- - You watch too much television. I just liked the way it looked. - So where'd you get it? - It was given to me. - So you don't think I could get one just like it then? - You ask too many damn questions! (women cheering) - Sorry. I'm not tryin' to cause any problems. - Wait a minute. Are you sure you didn't see what happened to it? - I'm positive; if I see it, I'll let you know. (tense music) (women cheering) (women clapping and cheering) - I called you right after he left. I don't know how he found me. - You know what I can't figure out, Brenda? Is why you didn't try to stall this guy. You know, we might've gotten here in time to nail him. - Well, and what was I supposed to do with him while I was calling you? - You know, I just hope you're tellin' me the truth, Brenda. 'Cause right now, I can't even prove that Carl lived in that apartment that got blown up. - (scoffing) I can see right now that you're not gonna be any help to me at all. - Look, we've been chasin' this group for a long time, and we're tired of chasin' 'em. Right now, you're our only tie to them. - Excuse me, what's goin' on here? - I called them; Carl came by and he threatened me. - Carl was here? - I don't know how he found me. - All right, all right. John Stockton, Miss Carter's attorney, can I help you? - Detective McKenzie. No, I have no more questions for now. - Well, thank you very much for stopping by. I can take care of it from here. - Be talkin' to you, Brenda. - Afternoon. - You too. - What the hell's the matter with you, huh? (Brenda scoffs) Now you look at me! I said, what the hell is the matter with you? You call them before you call me? - What was I supposed to do? I didn't know he was coming by. (sirens wailing) - Well, you listen, you do me a favor next time, anything like this happens, you call me first, do you understand? - Fine! - You understand? - Yes. - Good. - Why are you getting so bent out of shape? - Because I care about you, Brenda. Because I want you to be okay, all right? I mean, you above all should know you can't rely on the goddamn police department. - I'm sorry. (soft music) - All right, all right. (eerie music) - We must guard our privacy with more caution. No longer do we admit outsiders or strangers into our midst until we are certain they have accepted the power of the dark side. And if one of these enemies should threaten our existence, we shall deal with them accordingly. - I terrorized her right before she left the prison, like you asked. That should keep her vulnerable for a while. - And that was very good work. - What about the other girl? The one who I think took my pentagram. - [Evil Priest] Do you think she still has it? - No, she just asked too many questions about it. I think she already knows too much already. - Well, then we shall grant her her freedom. (evil priest chuckling) For it's easier to control her once she is on the outside. - And what about Brenda? - [Evil Priest] And what do you suggest, Brother? - I prefer that we silence her altogether. - [Evil Priest] This is a matter that shall be decided by the entire group. - I choose to kill her. - And if you act upon your own, you shall be banished, banished! For eternity from this coven. Do you understand, Brother? - Yes. - [Evil Priest] Good, excellent. Now, my dear friends and brothers, how do you prefer to punish her, in the usual way? (eerie music) Excellent. Then we shall use our power and not our hands. (onlookers chanting) (eerie music) (chains clinking) (flesh squelching) (door latch clicks) (keys rattle) - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't think you'd be awake. - I couldn't sleep. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay now. I had these really bad pains in my stomach, and then I had this horrible, horrible nightmare. This girl was being mutilated by the coven, and then just as they were about to cut her head off, I woke up. - Jesus, is that the first time you had a dream like that? - Yeah, but it seemed so real, I mean, it seemed as though I were really there watching it. - Well, listen, you had a rough go of it, but you're all right now. Why don't you go back to bed and try and get some sleep, all right? - Okay. - Goodnight. (soft music) (objects rattling) - What are you doing? - Oh, uh, it's just uh, some game I picked up in Europe a couple of years ago. It's very intriguing, but I've never been able to master it. Do you wanna see how this works? - Mm-hmm, sure. - Okay, so what you do is you take the trinket (Brenda chuckles) out of her ear, (chuckling) and you put it under the shell, give it a spin, and then you try and locate it. - This one. I've seen this game before, only the board was different. - Well, its origins date back thousands of years, but, supposedly, royalty would have the townspeople play it, and then if they lost, they'd cut a finger off. - Ew, they cut off their finger? - Cut off a finger. - Why would anyone wanna play? - Well, it wasn't like they were asked to play. They were ordered to. - I don't think I wanna play. (chuckling) - No? - No. - You afraid I'm gonna cut your finger off? (Brenda chuckles) Here, we'll just do it for fun, all right? (shell clinks) You ready? (eerie music) And guess which one? - [Brenda] This one. - (imitates buzzing) Wrong. (Brenda chuckles) - There's something really funny about this game. - Well, rumor has it that there was a spell cast on this game making it impossible to win, which I believe, because I've been racking my brain for hours and I always make the wrong choice. - Let me try it one more time. - Well, wait a second, you're down to eight fingers here. You gotta cool off for a minute. (Brenda chuckles) - Listen, um, there's something that I've been meaning to ask you. - What's that? - Why is it that my case is so important to you? - Uh, I guess you have the right to know. Not too long ago, (sighs) I lost somebody very close to me to a satanic cult. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Wow. (John's hand pats Brenda's leg) Goodnight. - Goodnight. (eerie music) (intense music) (ominous music) (eerie music) (people speaking faintly) - You wanted to see me? (tense music) - Yes, I did actually. - Well, what do you want? - You're bein' released today. - So you mean I could just walk right outta here then? (guard laughing) - That's right. Just remember one thing when you're on the outside. - What's that? - It's a big, bad world out there. People get hurt. (keyboard clacking) - [John] Hi. - Hi. - Listen, I hope you're not upset with me for yellin' at you in front of the police, all right? - Don't worry about it. - Well, I can't expect you to get any writing done if you're gonna be mad at me. - (chuckling) I'm fine. - Yeah? - Honest. - Honest? - Mm-hmm. - So, how you doin' here? - (sighs) I don't know, oh, it's coming along, I'm just, I'm really upset about this dream I had last night. - Can I take a look here? - Sure, you're gonna see it sooner or later. - That's good. (keyboard clacking) Very good, very good. - Thanks. - All right. (suspenseful music) (guard bangs lockers) (keyboard clacking) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Hi, is this Brenda Carter? - Who is this? - Hi, my name is Joan Lake, I have a local talk show on at three in the afternoon, perhaps you've seen it? - Yeah, yeah, sure I have, this is, I'm Brenda Carter. - Good, I'm glad I got through to you. The reason why I'm calling is I read about you in the police reports and I'd be very interested in having you on as my guest; would you be interested? - Well, when were you thinking of doing this? - How does tomorrow look for you? - Yeah, I think people need to know this. I'd be happy to do your show. - Great, that's wonderful; how does 1:30 sound? Wonderful, well, why don't you be at the studio? The address is 555 Southwestern Avenue. All right, see you then, bye. Yes. (bus announcer speaks faintly) (soft music) (keyboard clacking) (doorbell rings) (knocking at door) - Who is it? - Open the door, it's me, Rachael. Hurry up, close the door. - What's wrong, what are you doing here? - They just released me. I don't know why, but I didn't ask a lot of questions. The guard threatened me before he let me go. - He threatened you? With what? - Just saying that it's gonna be really dangerous on the outside. (sighs) You should've seen the look in his eyes when he said it. Brenda, I am really scared. I made sure no one followed me here. Can I stay here for a couple days? I don't have any place to go. - Yeah, sure you can, I mean, it's not my place, I have to ask John, but I'm sure it'll be okay. - Please, ask him. - I will as soon as he gets home. (phone ringing) I'll be right back. Yes, hello. - Brenda, Detective McKenzie. I'm out at the city overlook, I need your help, kid. There's somethin' I have to show you. How soon can you get out here? - I'll be there as soon as I can. - Good. (phone beeps) (Brenda sighs) (sirens wailing) - I've gotta go out for a few minutes. Don't worry-- - What? Where are you going? - I'll be right back, okay? Don't worry. - All right. (soft music) (door latch clicks) (someone speaking on police radio faintly) (dog barking and howling) - Brenda, thanks for comin'. Listen, I have to show you somethin', all right? It's not very pleasant, so I want you to brace yourself, okay? Come on. Men. (someone speaking on police radio faintly) (intense music) (Brenda gasping) (Brenda moans) It's all right. Cover it up. Deep breaths, kid, deep breaths. (Brenda breathing heavily) - [Dispatcher] On Wilshire Boulevard, a 3109 Wilshire. (speaking faintly) 1181 in Hollywood, all available units required. (Brenda sobbing) - It's okay, it's all over now. - Why did you want me to come up here and look at this? (Brenda sobbing) - There's something very strange about this particular murder, Brenda, aside from the fact that the head was taken off the victim. There was a pentagram carved into their chest. - [Dispatcher] 25 Holden Coast Road. (dog howling) - Have they identified who it is? Who it was? - No, probably just some poor transient, that's all. Brenda, what can you tell me? Anything at all? - I've told you everything I know. - [Dispatcher] A 111 (speaking faintly) - Look at me. I need your help. (woman speaking on police radio faintly) - I had this dream last night that this girl was being sacrificed and they cut her head off. - More than a coincidence, Brenda, that's a lot more than a coincidence. Look, I know you're not gonna like this. I need you to come down to headquarters with me, all right? - I want John here if I'm going to say anything else. - John? (scoffs) All right, he's on his way. - I'm sorry I'm late, you all right? - He's been askin' me questions all day long. All I wanna do is go home. - Now you listen to me, Detective, you got no right to do this, you're harassin' my client. This is a friendly witness, do you understand? - All right, lighten up, Counselor. - Lighten up? You want me to lighten up? Let me tell you, it's not in my nature. - (sighs) All right, you're free to go, Brenda. - Good, let's go. - Thank you. - But listen, (typewriters clacking) if you think of anything else, will you call me? - (sighs) There is one more thing that happened today. I don't know if it's important. - What? - I agreed to go on The Joan Lake Show. I mean, if that's okay with you, to talk about it on the air. - Well, it's okay with me. I'm not too sure what the cult's gonna feel about it. - What do you mean? - You go on a national TV show, you make yourself a pretty big target. Brenda, just be careful, okay? - What are you doin'? Huh, what are you doin', you tryin' to be a hero? You goin' on some goddamn crusade? - Carl already knows where I am. What's the difference if I go on the show or not? - You're askin' for trouble here, okay? I'm totally against this, you understand? - People need to be warned. - People need to be warned, huh? You wanna be on TV, hmm? You wanna be on TV, then go get your own goddamn sitcom! Oh, Christ. (soft music) (door latch clicks) (birds twittering) - Hi, how did it go? What was so important? - It was, it was really unpleasant. This girl had been mutilated, and they found her body at the city overlook. - God. I was reading your story. (chuckling) I hope you don't mind. - No, it's fine. - (sighs) There's something in here that gives me the creeps. The part about this meeting you went to, well, I had this nightmare last night where this girl was being sacrificed. It was exactly the same as this. - You dreamt this? - Yes. They carved something in her chest, and then they cut her head off. (eerie music) - This is really creepy. I had the same dream, and then they find this girl, and her head is cut off. - What is going on here? How can we have the same dream? - John's here, I'll see if it's okay if you stay. (door latch clicks) - Hi. - Hi. How was your day? - It was fine, just fine. \Who's that? - That's my friend Rachael, I was wondering if maybe she could stay here for a couple of days. - What, she doesn't have a place of her own? - No, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't really important, but she needs me. - All right, great. Well, you do what you want, okay? - Thanks. (birds twittering) He said it was fine. - (sighs) That's a relief. Why are you keeping this? (eerie music) - I'm not sure, I don't know, I guess it's some sort of bizarre fascination. I feel like as long as I'm holding onto it, I have a sense of power over this guard. - Yeah, well, you can have it back. (scoffs) It gives me the creeps. (Brenda chuckles) (eerie music) - (clears throat) Yes, sir, you wanted to talk to me. - Yeah, I certainly do. I understand that you released Rachael Somers. What would make you do a dumb thing like that? - I, uh, thought that she was ready to be released. I didn't see anything wrong, I, uh-- - Let me tell you somethin', you're lucky you have tenure here, otherwise I would have busted your ass. As it stands right now, you're gonna be responsible for everything she decides to do outside. You better hope she doesn't get into trouble. - Yes, sir, I'm sorry, I'm sure she won't. - Yeah, all right, you can go. - Uh, by the way, what's been happening with that girl Brenda Carter, the one we released last week? - She's doin' all right, I just saw her today. She's gonna be on The Joan Lake Show tomorrow. - The Joan Lake Show? (chuckling) - Yeah. - No kidding? (ominous music) - [Dispatcher] Gun in the Schwarzman home. - [John] Excuse us, gentlemen. Thank you. - [Man] I need Car 23, Car six, five one in the hole. - Why did you want me to come here? - I just wanted to see if it reminded you of somethin'. Come on. (someone speaking on police radio faintly) (suspenseful music) - It's cold in here. (ominous music) - So, bring back any memories? - No. Can we go now? - Just a minute. (eerie music) Why don't you tell me where everybody was? - Carl and I were standing over there, and the leader of the cult was right there. - Right here, huh? - Yeah. (somber music) (onlookers chanting) (intense music) (eerie vocalizing) - Are you all right? (Brenda gasps) Look at me; you all right? - Yeah. I just wanna go now, I wanna go to my interview. (suspenseful music) (John snapping fingers) (engine rumbling) - You know, it's not too late to change your mind about doin' the show. - I know, but I really wanna go through with it. - All right, well, I'll tell you what, you know where to reach me, when you're finished, you give me a call, I'll pick you up. - Okay, bye. - Bye-bye. (engine rumbling) (buzzer buzzes) - Hi, you must be Brenda, I'm Joan. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - You're not nervous, are you? - A little bit. - Oh, have a seat. Here are the list of questions I'll be asking you. You can look them over before we go on. Now don't you worry about a thing, you'll do fine. See you on the set. - Excuse me, hi, can I get you some coffee or anything? - Yeah, coffee, black, please. (people speaking faintly) (telephone ringing) - Here we go. - Ah, thank you. - Sure. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Sean, I work on the show. - Hi, I'm Brenda. - Nice to meet you. - I'm gonna be interviewed today. - Oh, I know, I read the schedule. - Who is that woman? - Oh, she's another one of the guests today, on the show. She's a priestess of black magic. - It is not polite to stare. - I'm sorry, I didn't realize-- - There are many things you do not realize about yourself. - What do you mean? - I know who you are, you do not need to tell me. You are a betrayer, you are one who cannot be trusted. - I don't know what you're talking about. - The reason you are here today, to share your naive views with the world. But you are not a threat to me, I am more powerful than you. - Why are you saying these things to me? I don't even know you. - It is people like you who hurt us, you do not understand the powers of the dark side. (footsteps echoing) - She's crazy. - She's frightening. - What are you doin'? - I wanted to see what she was reading. - [Sean] It's blank. - That's odd. (buzzer buzzes) - Ooh, I gotta get back to the set. I'll talk to you after the show, okay? (dramatic music) (Brenda gasps) - We're ready to go on the air. (eerie music) (upbeat music) Hi, and welcome to our show. Today's guests are Brenda Carter, a woman who recently discovered she was dating a man who belonged to a satanic cult, and Priestess Tura, a self-proclaimed witch who practices black magic. - I'd like to clarify that I'm a priestess, not a witch. - Yes, thank you; now, Brenda, could you explain to us how you got involved with this man you were seeing? - Well, when I first got involved with him, I had no idea that there was anything unusual about him. That was the really scary part, he was kind, he was gentle, and I fell in love with him. And then my whole world was shattered. One night, he took me to the cult's meeting hall. I had no idea what to expect. I just want everyone to know that-- - Yes, now, Brenda, could you tell us what you saw there? - There was this group of people, and they were chanting, and this girl was struggling, and I think that they were about to sacrifice her. - Most likely it was a symbolic sacrifice, where no blood is drawn. - I don't know what it was, I know that the police came in and stopped it before anything else happened. - Now, Priestess, you say that these sacrifices are symbolic. On today's news, a body was found decapitated with a pentagram carved across its chest. I think that this is more than symbolic. - You shouldn't jump to conclusions. There is no proof who is responsible. It could've been a group of teenagers experimenting with something they learned from a heavy metal album. - Either way, this does not sound like a normal murder. The police have no leads so far. - They took me up to see the body this morning. - Well, I wasn't aware of this. Do they think that there is a link somehow? - The really frightening part is I had this vision last night where this girl was being murdered, and it was very much in the same way as the body that they found. - What do you mean by a vision? - Well, it was like a dream, but it was different. It was kind of like a spell or something. - Ooh, well, this sounds like your territory, Priestess. - You shouldn't make light of it. Spells are very difficult to break once they have been cast on you. It undermines everything that you do, almost like a toxin that has been set free within your body. - What do you mean that they're difficult to break? How do you get rid of one if one's been cast on you? - Ooh, this sounds serious. - Yeah, I need to know. - I make a living in the field of black magic. People come to me for love potions, how to place hexes, incenses, brews, herbs, et cetera, but you must believe in the power for them to work for you. I can sense that you do not. - Well, how do I get rid of a hex if one has been placed on me? - It is not of my doing to help you. You are an enemy of the power. You will have to seek help elsewhere. - And that's the first part of our show. Thank you, Brenda, for sharing her experiences, and Tura, who you can find in the yellow pages if you ever need her assistance. We'll be right back with an expert on what you can find when you play records backwards. (upbeat music) (door latch clicks) (eerie music) (nightstand clatters) (footsteps creaking) (buzzer buzzes) - Are you okay? You don't look too good, can I get you something? - No, I'm fine. That woman is so strange. I know she can help me, but she just won't. - Well, she's leaving now, you wanna talk to her? - No, no, I'm fine, it wouldn't do any good anyway. Listen, do you know if there's a phone someplace? I need to arrange for a ride home. - Oh, well, heck, I could take you. I'm off the rest of the day. - Are you sure? I do have someone who can come pick me up. - (chuckling) It's fine, it'd be my pleasure. - Okay, thanks. - Great. - I really appreciate this. - Ah, don't worry about it. Right over here. - Okay. (engine rumbling) (intense music) (tires squealing) This part of town gives me the creeps. - (chuckling) Why do you say that? - The meeting hall that Carl belonged to is right up there. (eerie music) (tires squealing) - This car behind me is following awfully close. - It's that son of a bitch from prison. - It's who? - Never mind, just turn up here. (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (gunshot booming) (Brenda cries out) (gunshot booming) (tires squealing) (gunshot booming) (tires squealing) (gunshot booming) (Brenda cries out) (tires squealing) (gunshots booming) (Brenda cries out) Sean! He's right behind us! - I'm tryin'. (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (gunshot booming) (Brenda crying out) What are you doing? - Carl told me about this. He said it wards off bad things that happen to you. - Are you kidding me or what? - Look, do you have any better ideas? Tura said that you have to believe in it in order for it to work for you. (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (water splashing) (metal clattering) (somber music) - What happened to him all of the sudden? Did you do this? With that? - I don't know, I just held onto it and I concentrated. It was like it read my thoughts. (eerie music) - Where'd you get that? - It was his. - This is getting weird. (chuckling) You be careful with that. - [Rachel] Hi, you looked really good on television. Too bad that witch kept interrupting you. - [Brenda] Thanks. - [Rachel] Who's this? - [Brenda] This is Sean, he works at the television station. He gave me a ride home. - Something wrong? - [Brenda] Well, let's just say that we won't have to worry about the prison guard anymore. - [Rachel] What do you mean? - [Brenda] He was waiting for me outside of the studio. He tried to run us off the road, but he lost control of his car. - [Rachel] So you mean he's dead? Good. - [Brenda] Rachael, I held onto the pentagram, I believed, I made it happen. - [Rachel] You really believe that's what caused it? - [Brenda] He probably would've shot us if I hadn't have used it. - [Sean] What are you doing? - [Rachel] I need all the protection I can get. It worked for you, it'll work for me, right? - [Brenda] You can hold onto it for now, I need some water. Do you guys want anything? - [Sean] Oh, no, thanks. - [Rachel] So what exactly did you guys do to make this thing work? - [Brenda] Why are you suddenly so obsessed with this? - [Rachel] Listen, I had that nightmare that came true. They're after me, I can sense it. I just wanna know what I should do. - [Brenda] I had the same idea, I asked the priestess, but she didn't want anything to do with me. - [Rachel] Oh, that's right, she's the expert. Then maybe she can help me. - [Brenda] You're getting a little carried away with this, Rachael, I'm the one who should be worried. - [Rachel] I know, but I need to look out for myself. What was her name again? - [Sean] Priestess Tura. - [Rachel] Oh, that's right, and they said she was in the phone book too. Oh, there it is, it's in a bad area of town. - [Brenda] Yeah, well, good luck getting there. - [Rachel] What about you, would you take me? - [Sean] Uh, yeah, I guess so, sure. - [Rachel] Great, I'm gonna make an appointment. (eerie music) (insects chirring) - [Sean] That's the place. - [Rachel] (sighs) Wish me luck. (door latch clicks) (doorbell rings) - [Tura] Welcome, I've been expecting you. - [Brenda] Hi, sorry if I'm a little early. - [Rachel] No need to apologize, come in. (door creaks) Can I get you something, an herbal tea perhaps? - [Rachel] Uh, no thanks, I'm not that thirsty. - [Tura] Herbal tea is not for thirst. It is part of a ritual. (somber music) - [Rachel] Actually, it's not that bad, what's in it? - [Tura] Coriander, mugwort, belladonna, and hemlock. - [Rachel] What's that? - [Tura] Keeps me regular; now what can I do for you? You sounded like it was urgent over the phone. - [Rachel] It is. - [Tura] How about a tarot card reading? It's my specialty; let's see, you look like you'd be from the family of cups, no, maybe wands. - [Rachel] What are you talking about? - [Tura] Your coloring, it decides what group you belong to. - [Rachel] I wasn't interested in having my fortune told. - [Tura] How about a love potion? Make the man of your dreams fall madly in love with you. - [Rachel] Mm, maybe later. Is something burning? - [Tura] No, it is merely incense. Sandalwood, dragon's blood, and pine. - [Rachel] Oh, I thought you had a cake in the oven. - [Tura] Are you making fun of my beliefs? - [Rachel] (sighs) No, I'm not, I'm sorry. I'm deadly serious, I really need your help. - [Tura] Then what do you want? - [Rachel] I need a hex broken. - [Tura] So you think someone has cast a spell on you? - [Rachel] I'm not certain, but I think so. I've been having these haunted visions, and one of 'em came true. - [Tura] You should be proud, perhaps you're a clairvoyant. - [Rachel] I don't care about that, I just want it to stop. - [Tura] It's all right, I understand. So, you are a believer? - [Rachel] A what? - [Tura] A believer in the dark powers. Wearing this was a wise move. - [Rachel] Yeah, but this isn't enough. I need more protection, what can I do? - [Tura] Yes, you've come to the right place. A gun or a guard dog will not stop the dark powers. - [Rachel] Exactly. - [Tura] Follow me. Did you bring any money with you? - [Rachel] Money? - [Tura] Yes, protection doesn't come for free. - [Rachel] This is all I have. - [Tura] That's plenty, now be seated. Now concentrate. How do you think this spell was placed on you? - [Rachel] I don't know. - [Tura] We must summon the powers from the other side, and they will help you with what you need. - [Rachel] Summon the powers, isn't that supposed to be dangerous? - [Tura] Not if done properly; they will assist you. (ominous music) - [Rachel] What are you doing? - [Tura] Preparing for their arrival. - [Rachel] Whose arrival? (eerie music) (jingling) (eerie choral music) - [Tura] If you are here, make yourself known. (something blasting) - [Rachel] What is that? - [Tura] Silence, you'll frighten it away. Speak, where do you come from? - [Demon] Why have you summoned me from beyond? - [Rachel] Oh my God. - [Tura] We need your assistance in a matter. - [Demon] What is your wish? - [Tura] We need to free this girl of a demon that haunts her in her sleep. - [Rachel] I also want protection against the dark powers. - [Demon] I will help you, bring me Achillea, dill, elder wood, and flaxseed. - [Tura] I have them. - [Demon] Wrap them together in cloth, bind them tightly. It will bring you restful nights and sleep. - [Rachel] Is there anything else? - [Demon] Yes, I present you with a coffin nail from the depths of Earth. Use it when you fear the power of the other side. They cannot take your mind, but they will come after your body and soul. - [Rachel] Is that everything? - [Demon] Yes, use them wisely. It will only work for those who believe in the power. And remember, beware of the man who bears ill testimony. - [Rachel] Wait, what does that mean? (something blasting) (insects chirring) - [Tura] Here is what you will need, use them carefully and they will stop whatever has been troubling you. - [Rachel] That's all there is to it? - [Tura] Do not take these things lightly. They have powers not known to our world. - [Rachel] Thanks, (sighs) you've been a big help. (door latch clicks) - [Sean] Well, what happened? - [Rachel] You had to have been there. (sighs) - [Brenda] They cannot take your mind, but they will come after your body and soul? - [Rachel] That's right, that's exactly what she said. And to beware of the man who bears ill testimony. - [Brenda] Rachael, I think you're taking this whole thing a little bit too seriously. - [Rachel] Fine, you seem to have forgotten what happened to you earlier today. Well, I believe in these things, and that means they're gonna work for me! - [Brenda] I haven't forgotten. I just don't know about this stuff, I'm skeptical, especially when it comes to fortune tellers with neon signs in their window. I don't know, I don't know what the hell to think anymore. I wish you well. - [Rachel] I know, (sighs) I'm sorry I snapped at you, okay? - [Brenda] It's all right. - [Rachel] So where should I sleep tonight? - [Brenda] The sofa's fine. (insects chirring) I guess I shouldn't have been so hard on her. - [Sean] Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, she'll be okay. You should've seen the look on her face when she came out of that house. (Brenda and Sean chuckle) - I can imagine. I didn't get a chance to thank you for givin' me a ride home today. - [Sean] Oh, I'm sure you're just glad to get home in one piece. - Thanks to you. - [Sean] What do you mean? - [Brenda] Well, that was some pretty sharp driving there. (Brenda and Sean chuckle) - Thanks. - You're welcome. (something buzzing) (eerie music) (insects chirring) (ominous music) - [Carl] Creatures of power, your anger has felt its start. Let her feel my anger burning in her heart! (growling) Here's thinking of you. (groaning) (clattering) - [Brenda] Ow! (Brenda gasps) - You okay? (Brenda groans) Brenda? (Brenda groans) Brenda? (Brenda breathes heavily) What's wrong? - [Brenda] I don't know, there's something... (Brenda breathes heavily) Oh. I'm scared, Sean. - [Sean] I know. - [Brenda] I'm sorry. - [Sean] Hey, there's nothing to be sorry about. I'm worried about you. - [Brenda] So am I. - [Sean] Hey, it's gonna be all right, you're gonna be okay. Maybe you should get some sleep. - [Brenda] Okay. Your help really means a lot to me. Will you call me? - [Sean] Sure. - [Brenda] Thanks. (birds twittering) Morning. - [Rachel] God, you look like hell. - [Brenda] Thanks a lot. - [Rachel] Couldn't you sleep last night? - [Brenda] Hey, I slept some, it's being awake that makes me like this. - [Rachel] Those came for you this morning. (soft, ominous music) - [Brenda] Here's thinking of you. (clattering) You know, I am really sick of this shit. I don't need this anymore, I've had... - [John] What's wrong, what's wrong? - [Brenda] John, hey are still harassing me, I have had it! - [John] All right, all right, listen to me, listen to me. Look, I know it's gonna be hard. Listen to me, you gotta hang in there and you gotta stay focused, all right? Now how's your writing going? Come on, how's it goin'? - I'll get to it today! - [John] All right. Look, your parole officer contacted me. - [Brenda] And? - [John] And he wants to see you this morning. - [Brenda] Are you going with me? - [John] No, he didn't sound like he wanted me to join you. Look, you can handle this on your own, all right? - [Brenda] Okay, wish me luck. - [John] Good luck, I'll see both of you later, all right? - [Rachel] Bye. (door latch clicks) - [John] Bye. - [Brenda] This is just what I need. (traffic rumbling) (horns honking) - [McKenzie] Well, we found one of your old prison guards this mornin', Brenda. He was sittin' in his car at the bottom of a river, upside down. I don't suppose you know anything about that, do you? - [Brenda] Should I? - [McKenzie] Quit screwin' with me, Brenda, I'm not in the mood for this shit anymore! (people speaking faintly) - [Brenda] He was waiting for me when I left the studio. He tried to run me off the road, but he lost control and he crashed. - [McKenzie] Well, considering the way that guy's been actin' lately, I guess I believe you. Brenda, you have got to keep me informed, do you understand? - [Brenda] I was afraid to. I didn't know how it was gonna look. - [McKenzie] (sighs) Yeah, I understand. Listen, we also found some other very strange paraphernalia in the car with the guy. - [Brenda] Like what? - [McKenzie] The usual, a dagger, a human skull, a crucible, this guy was more heavily into satanism than your old boyfriend was. - [Brenda] I guess I really know how to pick 'em, huh? - [McKenzie] Also, we found some paperwork. If we're lucky, we might be able to link it to some of the members in the group. Right now, the police lab's goin' over it. It's pretty waterlogged. Who knows, we might just get you off the hook yet, kid. - [Brenda] That would be nice. - [McKenzie] Brenda, keep in touch with me, okay? - [Brenda] Okay. (eerie music) (birds twittering) (door latch clicks) (shower water splashing) (door latch clicks) (ominous music) (ominous whooshing) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (Rachael screaming) - [Carl] You were supposed to be Brenda. Who are you? (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (papers rustling) You can't even imagine the mistake you made in writing this. (doorbell ringing) - [Sean] Oh, hi, is Brenda here? - [Carl] I was lookin' for her myself, who are you? (ominous music) So, where do you know Brenda from? - [Sean] Oh, we met over at the TV studio. Where do you know her from? - [Carl] Oh, we're old friends. Was she supposed to meet you here? - [Sean] Uh, no, no, I just, um, I assumed she'd be here, but I can come back later. But if you could leave-- (intense music) (Sean groaning) (dramatic music) (thudding) (Sean groaning) (Sean and Carl groaning) (door latch clicks) (Sean and Carl groan loudly) (somber music) Who was that? - [Brenda] That's my ex-boyfriend. Are you okay? - [Sean] Yeah. What have I done? - [Brenda] You saved my life. Why are you here? - [Sean] I came to see you. (Brenda snuffles) - [Brenda] I'm gonna call the police. (eerie music) (Brenda screaming) - Oh God. (Brenda weeping) It's over. - [Brenda] That bastard was probably waiting in the house the whole time. (somber music) Look, I just, I just need a few minutes to get myself together, okay? - [Sean] I'll call the police. - [Brenda] No, wait, I want, I want, I think I should call John first, I... - [Sean] Why? - [Brenda] Look, this is just gonna be too much for the police. I mean, what if they don't believe us? - [Sean] That's ridiculous, I mean, come on, we have-- - [Brenda] You killed Carl! Why should they believe you? - [Sean] Jesus, you're makin' this so complicated. - [Brenda] This is a double murder, this is complicated! John got me out of jail, I wanna call John! - [Sean] Fine, do what you want! - [Brenda] Where are you going? - [Sean] I gotta go home, okay? I need some time, I, I need to be alone. Tell the police that that's where I'll be, and I'm ready to make a statement. I gotta go. - [Brenda] Don't go, Sean! (phone ringing) - [John] Yeah? - [Brenda] Listen, something terrible has happened. I haven't called the police yet because you told me you wanted me to talk to you first. I came home and Rachael was murdered. Carl did it, and now he's dead too. I'm home by myself and I just wanna know if I can call the police now. - [John] No, no, listen, no, you just stay calm, you did the right thing, I'll call the police, all right? I'll be right there, and, Brenda, you don't talk to anybody, you understand? - [Brenda] Okay, please hurry. - [John] You got it. (ominous music) (phone bangs) All right, it's all right, it's all right, I'm here now. He's never gonna bother you again. - [Brenda] Are you sure you called the police? Why aren't they here yet? - [John] Just take it easy, yeah? Take it easy. (suspenseful music) - [McKenzie] All right, that's the page with the list of the members. Look who's at the top. I'll be a son of a bitch. (ominous music) (bottle clinks) - [John] Brenda? Drink some of this, it'll calm you down. - I don't want any. - Drink it. It's good for you. That's right. All gone, all gone, all gone. Good girl, hmm? (phone ringing) - [Brenda] Aren't you gonna get that? - [John] It'll wait. Drink some more. - [McKenzie] Come on, come on, answer, dammit. (phone ringing) - That's right, mm. Goodbye. (phone ringing) Better? (phone ringing) (Brenda thuds) (telephone ringing) - Shit! (sirens wailing) (camera clicking) Did you call the meat wagon? - [Cop] It's on its way. - [McKenzie] Shit. - [Sean] Brenda? - [McKenzie] Whoa, hold it, hold it, hold it, who are you? - [Sean] I'm a friend of Brenda's, the girl that's staying in the house. - [McKenzie] Come on in, come on in, come on in. Let him come. - [Sean] Yeah, um, do you know where she is? She's the one who called you. - [John] No, no, she never called us. Why don't you tell me where she is? - [Sean] Well, well, what do you mean she didn't call you? I was here a little bit earlier and she said she was gonna call the police after she talked to John, the guy who owns this place. - [McKenzie] Yeah, well, neither of 'em are here. Came here tryin' to ask some questions of Stockton. We think he knows more about this cult than he's lettin' on. We found this, good chance he's the leader. - [Cop] There's another one in the shower. - Oh, Jesus. - And she's dead. - [McKenzie] All right, all right, I'll be right there. Listen, you were here earlier today? - [Sean] Yeah. - [McKenzie] Well, I'm gonna have some questions for you, so just sit tight, all right? - [Sean] You need to send a car to the meeting hall. I mean, that's where they must be by now! - [McKenzie] Okay, hey, relax, okay? One thing at a time, just stay put. (sirens wailing) Watch him. (eerie music) (flames crackling) (chains rattling) (eerie music) - [Brenda] Oh my God, no. - [John] Silence! You have caused me enough trouble already. - [Brenda[ (sobbing) But why? Why did you take me to your home? What did you want from me? - [John] Why? Because I needed to know what you knew about us, and after I read your notes, I decided that you knew too much. - [Brenda] But I've only been here once. I really don't know anything. - [John] I don't know anything, I don't know anything, (chuckling) you can't be trusted. - [Brenda] But Carl's dead, and there won't be any trial, and I promise I won't say anything. - [John] The decision, brethren, is up to us. But remember, she is responsible for the death of two of our members. And so I say unto you, unto all of you, all those in favor of silencing her forever, raise your hand. (suspenseful music) (chuckling) It's unanimous, prepare to die. (ominous music) Oh, great powers that be, here is one that is ready to cross over into your world! - [Brenda] (sobbing) No. - [John] Oh, yes. (onlookers chanting) - [Brenda] (sobbing) No. - [Sean] Leave her alone! - [John] And who are you, little man? And what a fool, for to come here alone. - [Sean] I'm not entirely alone. I've come protected with your power, you son of a bitch. - [John] (chuckling) That'll be little use here. - [Sean] I've seen it work. - [John] Then show me now, little man. (onlookers laughing) You see, in order for the power to work, you must believe, or else it's just a hunk of junk around your neck. And you don't believe, do you, little man, do you? (onlookers laughing) You see, when you have no belief in your heart, well, then you have no protection, do you? (suspenseful music) (clattering) - [Brenda] He may not believe, but I do. (chains clanking) Get me down, Sean, quick. (Brenda panting) (flames roaring) - [John] You'll never get out of here alive! Ow! (John yelling) (spooky music) (building crashing) - [Sean] Look, not even one of them is trying to get out. (flames crackling) - [Brenda] You risked your life for me, Sean. - [Sean] I didn't know you believed in the power. - [Brenda] I didn't. What I believed in was you. (orchestral music) (flames crackling) (building clattering) (eerie music) (eerie choral music) (eerie music) (somber music) (melancholy music) (eerie music) (somber orchestral music)
