You have to stop. This is not good for us. Father says ... Why stop? Stop what? Lily, a man is only a man ... ... if he takes responsibility for his actions ... ... for his future and for his family. Look at me. I ensure peace and order. Those are the basics of a real man. Dad, why all these comparisons? Wiren has made a choice and we must respect that, right? You and Mom have always taught me to stand up for your interests. Reality works differently. Suriname works differently. You know that. I know what I am doing. -Wiren knows what he's doing. Wiren, that bullshit has to stop. Stop. Now. Dad, what are you doing? He must stop. That's what I'm doing. We must respect his choice, right? You can't deal with people like that, can you? I respect his choice, but he must also respect our choice. It affects our reputation. And I have to support him. No, you have to tell him to stop. Ma. Wiren. - Hey, what are you doing? Wiren. -What's happening to this boy? We have enough bandages in stock. What we lack are tools to perform emergency surgery. Help was also offered ... But before we begin today, I would like to introduce you to Dr. Richard Young. He has a lot of experience and as I have already told you he will ... ... be here for the next 11 months. Richard, if I may call you by your first name ... You worked with the famous Doctor Mendoza in Africa. How was that? -It was a really great experience. I learned a lot from Dr. Mendoza when we worked together in Ghana. And he told me ... ... that Ghana and Suriname have a common history. That is not true. People just say things. People often sell nonsense. It is true. -This boy, you know. What do you want again? When you go inland you can still hear Ghanaian dialects ... Okay, I'll do it for you. I'm busy, I still have so much to do. This boy ... Let's see ... - I can't wait to get started. Suriname has a lot to offer, I heard. -And... ... yes, it does it again. Okay, end of this meeting. Let's start. To work. More surprises. Chandra. Meet Dr. Richard Young from the United States of America. Oh, the new doctor. Oh sorry. My name is Chandra Persaud. -Richard Young. Nice to meet you. Nice to have you here. Is it your first time in Suriname? -Yes that's right. Chandra has been working here for about 15 years ... ... in fact, she's one of my favorite employees. Dr. Emanuel, stop it. You embarrass me. Do you want something to drink? -Yes, please have coffee. Dr. Emanuel? -No, I'm on a strict diet. But, Chandra, can you ... I'll see you later. I have to go. Day. Please. Dr. Emanuel, always busy, so kindhearted. If there were more people like him there would be peace everywhere. Yes that's right. I'll give you a tour. There are the toilets ... That's the office of Dr. the butcher's dog did something he is not allowed to swim without underpants tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, hup and then the police came he said, dirty dog you are not allowed to swim without underpants tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, hup Look, there, fish. Wipe your feet. Have you already viewed the timetable? -Yes, I'm going to do that now. Okay, make sure everything is okay. -I will do that. Okay. -See you later. And. Let me have a look. Good. This is a program especially for you. What's your name? Hey what's your name? ... group of schoolchildren concerned with nature. In their spare time and during the holidays. They asked us to make a video about their work ... ... so that the people at home ... Hello? So, I see you've met Wiren, our youngest colleague. Yes. Do you mind that he's here? No of course not. Wiren is family. Everyone in Suriname is family. But Wiren is special. He's deaf, but he's still enjoying his life. I noticed. Was he born deaf? -Yes. And his parents have big problems ... ... with the fact that he was born deaf. And why isn't he in school? A deaf boy at school in Suriname? In Nickerie? Can we do something about that? Dr Richard... ... I understand your concern ... ... but please focus on why you are here. Focus on your patients. We are in Suriname. Things don't change that easily. I understand. -Okay. Pion. It goes like this ... One or two. But three is not possible. Dr Young. Assistants. Okay, that's fine... Just a few more times. Here we go. Okay. To breathe. Pressing. Well done. Okay. Here we go. One more time, okay? Here we go. To breathe. To breathe. And press. Well done. There he is. Well done. Look at that. Okay. Wiren, outside. Outwards. Hello? Hello? Is there anybody here? Mama, someone is here. Hey. I heard someone calling us. Yes, I came here to talk to you about Wiren. Did he do something wrong in the clinic? No not at all. You have a smart son. He is... ... special and very intelligent. And I have come here to ask you ... ... or we can try to put him in school. Do you know that my son is deaf? -Yes. I'm afraid he'll get hurt. He will not be able to attend education. Everything is fine here? The doctor has come here to ask us if Wiren can go to school. School? No, soon the other children will laugh at him. I will help him with his homework and guide him. The doctor will help Wiren with the school. -I understand what he said. Wiren, do you want to go to school? I want to write ... ... and play there. You can try it. Thanks. Ah, good morning. How are you? Sorry, I'm from the clinic. I do not speak Dutch. English. Take a seat. Can I help you? Yes. I'm here today with this young man. His name is Wiren and he is interested in going to school here. And that's great. Young children ready to develop. Would you like a registration form, sir? Before we start, I have to indicate that Wiren cannot hear. Pardon? He is deaf. Okay. This is going to be a problem. Everyone at my school hears very well. They don't always listen, but you get it. Can we make arrangements for him? Maybe he could sit in the classroom and watch the teacher teach. You know, sir, it's not just about looking. The teacher explains the information, separate from the board and the books. He will miss a lot, sir. Suppose I make up for that by working with him after school. I'm very sorry, sir. My teachers are not authorized to handle this. What do you think about this. Give me three months to work with him. If it doesn't go well, we'll stop. You know, sir, I love it. The dedication you show to this young man ... Let's do it. It's for his education. I'm going to inform my team ... ... and I will make sure he gets the education he deserves. Nine times five is forty-five. Ten times five is fifty. One times six is ​​six. Hey ... Are you teaching him sign language? Yes, I study American Sign Language to help him further in the classroom. American? But here we speak Dutch. That's right. -So... Let me see. We have American, German ... Dutch. Good. A... A. A... A... A... No, do not wash yet. Before you wash your face ... First, breathe in ... Inhale ... Exhale ... Okay, now you. First, breathe in ... Exhale ... And now. Wiren, I spoke to my mother yesterday. Maybe we should listen to my father. I think we should stop. Wiren. Talk, say something. I don't want any trouble with the family. This makes me sad. My father knows how Suriname works. Lily, it's not about you and the family or your dad. I also do this for myself and for other people. Don't you get me? Is it so difficult to understand this? You only think about yourself. You don't think about me. Try to feel what I feel. And the next one is a very special person. He also completes this school with an excellent list of marks. May I have an extra round of applause for Wiren Jagessar. Yes. Good morning. De Ware Tijd, newspaper i. De Ware Tijd, 1.75 SRD please. Yes, thank you, sir. De Ware Tijd, newspaperi, newspaperi. Kranti. And? Have you thought about it? And? Have we thought about it? I'm going for option two. -He's going for option two. You understand that our cause will then become weaker. If we could choose one topic ... ... which Wiren thinks to rely on, we have a better chance of winning. I know exactly what I want. I don't want one topic addressed. It's all or nothing. It has to do with my rights. And with the rights of others. As a person, as a citizen of Suriname ... ... and as a citizen of the world. 'The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ... ... is an international human rights treaty ... ... of the United Nations, with the aim of protecting ... ... of the rights and dignity of people with disabilities.

What's your name? How? We start with the first exercise. You drop to your knees. Jump forward. Both arms up. Girl. Do you know who I saw at that party last night ? Nou? -Guilliano. Girl, my cousin is annoying, boi. If I knew she was going to invite him, I wouldn't have been. Ay boi. -He sat looking at me all the time. That thing made me nervous. -Don't talk so loud. What? Well, they don't hear anything. They are deaf. Suddenly, mister sat next to me, grabbed my hand. 'How are you?' I said, 'No, Guilliano. I've had a calling and I'm going to follow in my aunt's footsteps ... ... for God needs female servants to declare His word. ' Hello. Stop. Come eat. Dinner time.

Together. There is only one final. Okay? Again on the attack. The candy break actually aims ... ... raise money for new books and writing materials. Well done. Are there more people who want to add something to the survey? Yes ... I would like to say something, yes. I recently received a book from that new boy, Wiren. He uses the gesture method. Maybe we can use it as a basis? No. Mother Anna, we will not do that. We don't use these things, hand gestures . Those things, it's not working. But I have the book here. Maybe you can read it, Sister Anna. Mrs. Landbrug, at this school we use the oral method. Those children have to learn to make the sounds with their mouth. Yes they have to habla habla, they have to taki taki. The children must learn to speak with their mouths. Yes, but maybe we can read it. They have their own alphabet. They have the A ... ...B, C... -Nee. Mother Anna, we don't use that. They already use it in the Netherlands. -Ms Landbrug. Where are we now? We are in Suriname and not in the Netherlands. And.

She taught the children sign language. Okay? And then, I mind that and I took them. She must now be severely punished. Maybe fired. That teacher is crazy. Sister Anna, we were doing ... - Stop. What were you doing? We were practicing. It functions. I see progress. Can't we just test it? The children benefit. We can use the book as a basis and develop our own sign language. Mrs. Landbrug ... ... you cannot change things in this school on your own . Tenzin. -Is that clear? Yes, Sister Anna. Come on. Well done, Wiren. He kicks him. Wires. Kennedy. A day of change. We are also going to change the name of this school today . But before we do that ... ... I would first like to invite you to come forward, Mrs. Landbrug. Ms Landbrug, over the past two years you have done pioneering work ... ... when it comes to sign language for the deaf and hard of hearing. And the ministry has not gone unnoticed. And that is why we have come with a glad tidings. That is why we are here today. May I appoint you today as ... ... the new principal of Kennedy School. The Institute for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Congratulations. Take a seat. What can I do for you? I want to enroll in the university. What is this? Again, what can I do for you? I want to enroll in the university. You want to register. At University? I think you are wrong. Can you take it with you again? Diploma. Certificate. Congratulations. Dovendiploma. A deaf ... Graduate degree. You want to register with a PhD degree. A deaf person wants to enroll in university. Please, you can go again. What? You are deaf, you should not be here. You have to get out. - The deaf don't belong here. Get out. Go away. -You shouldn't be here. This is no place for the deaf. Get out. You are deaf. -Do not come back. You have to go. What? And now you bring the deaf? -I did not know. This one is also from our new collection. You can put it on. We also have it in several colors. Yes. You can take a look in the mirror. What are you doing here? Come on. Come on. Sit. What happened? How did your conversation go? Did something happen? Quiet. Wait for me outside. Wait outside. I am coming. Wiren, talk to me, do something. Are you angry or sad? 'Both.' Why? "You school, not me." Because you're deaf, Wiren. "You think I'm stupid too." No, you beautiful inside. You intelligent. That's why I like you. "Prove me." No, Wiren. You are not right. Love doesn't work that way. Feeling goes step by step. What is it? Have a seat. Your mother called. Your father is seriously ill. She wants you to go to Nickerie as soon as possible. Wiren YOU Have A Unique Power HIKE YOUR OWN PAD PA This economy is a sham prosperity. The bauxite is running out ... ... and then we are only dependent on gold and oil reserves. When things don't go well with these resources in the world ... ... then we are immediately in a recession. Not surprising, for a small scale economy like ours. Successive governments have failed to build financial reserves ... ... for periods of crisis. I have repeatedly discussed this matter with the Minister ... ... and when I come up with solutions ... ... they don't want to understand. So? You know that Wiren always ... ... had a dream to continue studying. He wants to go to Belgium. There they have studies that are taught in sign language. You are here to watch ... ... whether I finance it of course. It's very expensive. But I pay back every cent ... ... when I have work after my studies. It's not about the money. There is. But I wonder if he could handle it. Dad, you always told me ... ... that Wiren is the ideal man for me. He will not disappoint you. I am going to think about it. "The delusions the person sees are not for everyone." What does this professor mean by this? The image that existed before ... ... about paranoid patients is wrong. After my research I found out ... ... that patients can be helped much faster . Dance, noh. What are you looking at? -Dance. Today is your day. You have to dance. He doesn't hear anything, right. Dancing. Come on. You can do it. Yesterday, at our wedding, when we went dancing ... ... I watched them laugh. Those friends of your father. I know... ... that they always joke ... ... but I was laughed at ... ... because I can't hear. Wiren, don't worry too much about that. You are and will remain special to me. This is not about you. This has to do with respect. You are right... ... but Suriname is not that far yet. Good morning, Miss Els. May I introduce you to Wiren. He is now a business psychologist. He used to go to school here. Maybe the kids want to ask him some questions. Good morning. Thank you. I have a question. Are you really deaf? Yes. I am really deaf. How did you become a business psychologist? I have studied hard. How long have you studied? I studied for six years ... ...in Antwerp. I want to become a pilot. How can I do that? You have to hold on ... ... and work ... ... and always believe in yourself and your dreams. Case number AR 688 CR civil law. The civil case of Mr. Wiren Jagessar against the rule of law of Suriname. The lawyer of the constitutional state of Suriname did not show up. Madam judge, my client wishes to take a stand. Please go ahead, Mrs. Fransisca. Wiren Jagessar appeals to the international treaty ... ... that Suriname ratified in 2017. This treaty reads, and I quote: 'The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ... ... is a human rights treaty ... ... of the United Nations, with the aim of protecting ... ... of the rights and dignity of people with disabilities. ' Suriname ratified this convention in 2017 . My client stands up for his own rights ... ... and the rights of the deaf and hard of hearing in our country. My client asks for the state to be obligated ... ... to immediately implement the treaty provisions. This is all my client asks. We want to hear your client for themselves. Fine, Miss Judge. Mr. Jagessar, may I ask you what the claim is? I want the state of Suriname ... ... commences legal proceedings ... ... towards people with a hearing impairment and it has not yet been accepted. I've been worried a lot in recent months ... ... and I have experienced ... ... that deaf and hard of hearing ... ... being withheld in society here in Suriname . Mr Jagessar, what have you experienced? Deaf and hard of hearing people do not receive higher education. And their position is always withheld. What is your highest level of education? Madam judge, may I speak? We will come back to it later. We adjourn the session for 15 minutes. I was afraid of this. The judges do not seem to listen to the treaty as a whole. They are only concerned with Wiren. With what is his individual problem. He has received higher education abroad. But... ... there are many other points, such as information ... ... which never reached us. Isn't that a problem for me too? Let's wait and see what they decide. Do not jump to conclusions. May Wiren Jagessar and his representative ... ... Mrs. Daphne Fransisca, stand up? We have made a unanimous decision. Wiren Jagessar wants to sue the state of Suriname for the fact ... ... that others are duped. We are unanimous that there is no direct connection ... ... between the plaintiff and the constitutional state of Suriname. The plaintiff has no direct interest ... ... and also has no specific problem or right from the treaty ... ... that has been violated. We therefore declare this case inadmissible. The case has been dismissed. Lily is not at home. I'm here for you, not Lily. For you. Why? Do you think I'm crazy? I've heard it. You are planning something. Stop it. Stop it. I made you. I paid for your studies for you. That you can write today. I... Everything, everything here ... ... I gave to you. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. I do not talk anymore. Stop it. Dad, what are you doing here? Lily, I'm here to tell that motherfucker to quit. I've heard it all. It is enough. Lily, make him stop. He affects our interests. I do this for you. You are my blood, yes? Stop it. I am the plaintiff 's representative ... ... who file a case against the rule of law of Suriname. They have been the victims of non-compliance with the treaty provisions for years ... ... as defined in the international treaty ... ... of the United Nations on people with disabilities. In fact, Suriname has signed the children's rights convention ... ... and also ratified. That means that every child in Suriname ... ... is entitled to equal treatment ... ... limitation or no limitation. Equal treatment in the field of education ... ... equal treatment in the field of information and communication ... ... equal treatment ... ... in the field of legal protection. I call forward Mrs. Henriëtte van Landvelde. I think the state should fulfill its obligations. For example, that subtitles will be on television. That is very good for communication for the deaf. I call forward Mr. Serge Mendozoom. Yes, we have no education. All over the world, the deaf have education. We just need to get that good support ... ... to stand up for ourselves. But education, training, here ... Yes, we don't have that here. The government should help us in this, should support us in this. I am deaf. I work, but yes, I will not get any higher. For example, we will not become lawyers. I cannot become a chef in the company. To go higher where we work ... ... we actually don't. It's a shame. Deaf have children. They go to school. And often enough my parents, family, sisters ... ... for me to hear how my child is doing in school. No, I want to go there independently. The teacher should be able to gesture or be patient with me. For example, during meetings. I am deaf, a lot is spoken. If I were to ask my colleagues what they are meeting about ... ... they say 'wait a minute, I'm going to tell you later' ... ... and often enough I get to hear after the meeting ... ... what has been discussed. The hearing people may be a bit higher than me, but they have a diploma. And deaf and hearing people ... Yes, yes, he just wants to do more. You will be spoken to very briefly, also at work. You don't really talk to you for long at all. Yes, and that makes me sad. Yes. There are people who really don't help you and that's not fun at all. I call forward Mr Wiren Jagessar. When I decided to start this business ... ... I didn't think so many people would come to it. So many people... ... with the same feelings as I do. We must stand up for our rights. Stand up yourself. Sometimes I feel ... ... that I'm exaggerating. I feel like I have to do it alone. What we all want ... ... are the same rights. We want the same opportunities, the same rights. Don't let us down. Wires. Did you reach your goal today? I am not here to achieve a goal. I am here to protect the rights of my clients. Every person has rights. People with disabilities also have rights. Rights that we as a civilized society must protect. That is our duty as citizens of this country. Wiren, the judges now have an ear for the deaf. What do you think they will ultimately decide? Whatever they decide, I leave it to them. In any case, I have faith. Believe in the legal system of Suriname. We have made history today. We, together, have shown ... ... that no one about anyone else's ... ... determine the future. You determine that future yourself. Do you have anything last to say? Always be proud of who you are. Each individual ... ... has a unique power. One last question. Wiren. What now, Wiren? Wiren. -What are you going to do now? One more question, Wiren. Wiren, one more question. Wires.
