I'm from the neighborhood. My mother- makes a lousy ziti. That class sucked. Guess you have to have students call it a class- hello. My show. People change, you cross-eyed hump. Maybe I should make some flyers. You know, traditional dance is not exactly an easy sell. You think? You wanna know why no one came? Because mob hit is on. Watch and learn how to sell Italian culture. Got a problem with it? I gotta get changed. Dad's picking me up. Oh, oh, my god, did you hear his new horn? Why? Oh, I'm gonna be late for this gig. Hey... Am I supposed to know what that means? It means a whale's culo. It's slang. It means good luck, dumb-ass. You're a weirdo. It really does. Bing it. What? The horn. Godfather, really? It's an American classic. Not exactly Italian pride at its best. An Italian wrote it. An Italian directed it. And people love "the godfather." Or what they get whacked? Cost a lot of money to get the tuning right. You call that tuning? What's up with the cassette? And a boombox? What about the iPod we got you last year? Tony knows a guy that can hook it up. It didn't have Dean Martin. What good is it? It doesn't come preloaded. What's this? Ain't no gas left. So you rented the smallest vehicle ever. It's a convertible. Uh, where's Tony? You're late. I had a drop-off for the restaurant. Besides I just saw your father. Where's the Van? Aw come on, Quenton. There's no back seat. Where's Frankie supposed to sit? Hilarious. This is gonna be fun. Oh fuck. What's going on? Oh, oh, oh, oh! Quenton you're such a pussy. That's so disgusting. What? What's this? Close it. Wait. Oh, good god. You saw the bullet hole and everything? He was just so dead. Out of all the cars you could have rented, it was mob. Did you see his St. Christopher medal? Well, okay, well were his eyes open or shut? I think they were open. Enough you guys. We're going to the funeral. Why? So you can just fulfill your mob fantasies? You didn't see this guy. Exactly. That's why we're going. You're not going. It's dangerous besides two beautiful women show up. They're gonna think you're. Huh? You know, hookers. Oh, nice way to talk about wifey. We're not even engaged yet. Don't tell my mom. She's already planning the wedding. This morning, she asked if we wanted those candied almonds on the table. Confetti? Confetti? Why would you want confetti on the table? Confetti, the candy-covered almonds. Oh, confetti's the almonds. Got it. We are so not Italian. What? What? Heather tells me, all excited mind you, they're going to this freaking wake. You're allowing this? Can I stop them from anything? They're adults. God forbid they listen to me? Yeah, you realize whose wake this is. Your eldest found the body. She's freaked to high heaven. You should have a word with her. How are you so calm about this? You know, hand to god, I love those kids more than life, but this is not my problem anymore. Anything happens to them, so help me- yeah, we'll make sure it doesn't. Thought you quit. - I did. - - Yeah. Yeah. Where you two going? You need invitations. To a wake? Listen beautiful, I don't know you, and I don't know you. Need an invite. That's ridiculous. Hey Oeldo. Don't be a dick. These are friends of mine. From where? Oh, my sister's in a band. She comes to hear them play. Yeah, I bet she does. Come on. So you really play in a band? Yeah. Yeah, she has a gig tomorrow night. You should come. Oh, play weddings? No. Well if you play the old stuff and want to make some money. Oh, you book wedding bands? Awesome. You can help find a band for Frankie's wedding. You're engaged. - Not exactly, not yet. - I see. I mean we've talked about it. I sent him to look at the ring. You're choosing the ring? What? You work in weddings. It's what people do now. It's called planning. Well, people also plan their own funerals. What? This is just like every other Italian wake I've ever been to. I'm sorry, how did you guys know pinky? That's awesome. Is that his nickname? Did he get his pinkie's chopped off or something? Look at that guy. He's like Vince d'amico, only real. Jesus, Heather. You'll have to excuse my sister. She has these ideas about the mafia. She's the one who found him. I wouldn't advertise that here. This isn't the type of crowd that likes witnesses. Oh, smart. So you got a name? Frankie. Heather. My sister. You wanna fit in right? Yeah we do. Not really. Frankie and Heather, this is Caesar Bellafusco, my father. Senora Montessaro. My deepest sympathies. Discust. What's this? I'm gonna give this to my destiny foundation. Uh, hmm. Frankie. Mr. Roma. I told you my girlfriend's in there. Hey. Well I bet you know this guy too. No. Tony. Hey. I was worried about you guys. Come on, I'll take you home. Hey come to the show, little town in hoboken. Yeah, maybe. Thanks advertise where I'll be just in case someone wants to kill me. Oh my god, I can't believe you're better at this than me. Ledoux just sent these. Gagoot's at the wake. He's lucky Bellafusco doesn't punch his ticker too. Bunch of gargons, swear to god. The girls? What? I don't know. Put a tail on them. Okay. Caesar. I heard you were gonna be here. I did my communion with pinky that pencil prick. Look like it or not, I gotta be here. Out of respect for the good thing I like old ladies. Yeah, you're a prince. You see those feds out front? Always looking for the weak animal. Where's the loyalty? Even a traitor's lost Sonny. Just found some other loyalty. Kind of sounds like an ex-wife, huh? Pinky took a shot at me, not a smart man. So sure, where's the loyalty? What I gotta ask is who gave him a better deal. Say hello to your father. Staten island too small for him? Keep an eye on that ferry-riding fuck. Yeah sure. Thanks, by the way, for showing up at that wake. It was so awkward. We didn't need you, but thanks. I'm always gonna be there for you, Frankie. Seriously, Frankie. What is up with you? I wanted to wait for a more special time, but you just make things, I don't know, right. You get me. I do? Francesca del Vecchio, will you marry me? You've been talking the ring. Are you gonna answer me? Yes, Tony, yes. You know when we're married, I can focus on the things that I wanna do. I mean the business for one. Starting that frozen food line. With you by my side, anything is possible. Your anything is frozen food? I'm thinking long term. Well I'm not givin' up my music. Not today, but we all gotta give up something. We gotta find out together dream. Oh, hey, we better get goin. Well, what's the rush? Uh, the run-through? I promised Carlos I'd sub at the restaurant. I told you. You absolutely did not tell me, or I would have rescheduled rehearsal for like you know now. But then we wouldn't be engaged. Probably should start looking for a new lead guitarist anyway. Gonna have to give up that pipe dream someday. At least now I still have other dreams. Well I don't. You got me. What're you lookin' at? Now that's a prayer card. Italian's, we know how to do funerals, all right. Oh yeah, we really corner the market on that one. Hey, I'm proud of my heritage. Yeah, I don't have to advertise it on my car. And I didn't need to stand in the park for half a day doing yoga with the Chinese. It's tai chi, and they're not all Chinese. I'm glad you two got divorced. Really eased up on arguing. Your father doesn't argue, he obfuscates. I don't even know what that means. Get married. You'll learn. Don't we have any mafia in the family, like I don't know, a distant cousin or something? Did you tell her? What we do? - No! - - No! Look, I think what your mother is trying to say is that if this ever happens again- what do you mean if it happens again? Could happen. Let's just say no more funerals of this nature, okay? You've gone. You've satisfied your curiosity. Let's leave it at that. Thank you. I gotta ask though, what do you estimate the casket? Three grand? You think I was lookin' at the casket? Which reminds me that plot you have, you can bury whoever you want there. I'm gonna be cremated. What the hell are you talking about? Ash is for Wednesday. I gotta go the rest of my life wondering if your dead body is smeared on my forehead? They're from palms. Enough already. Divorced. Remember? Could it be any more obvious why? Huh? Why we got divorced. Was she Italian? Really? Parents. You're the ones who taught me to hide anything that might shame me in the morning. Practice what you preach. I'm keeping this. Hey, how was rehearsal? Awful. I had to play lead guitar. Baby, I'm working here, not messing around on you. I know. Sorry. Ooh, what a day. Whoo. Come here. Hey, your aunts out there. You tell her yet? Come on. Show them show them. Oh, oh, oh, god I was at rehearsal. I'm not used to it yet. - Yeah. - Nice. I'm so sorry we don't have time to celebrate. You'll see when you with Tony and Ronan. Hey, let them get married first. Oh, this is the most beautiful time for you. This and when you get pregnant. I think we're gonna wait. Ah, nah, that's what they all say. Now, when you are a good catholic. These things, they just come. Alright, oh. We just so happy. See and when we do have kids, I want them to know their culture. This girl's gonna make such a good Italian wife. Viva Italia. Hey, pop, the whole world isn't Italia, Italia, Italia. - Leave him alone. - Hey! Hey you won't make a good Italian wife if you disagree with me. Please if that's the case, I won't make a good Italian wife period. Ooh. Nice, smarty pantses. What? The toilet's not working. Just close the lid. Ew! Can you ask Tony? What do you do if a toilet's not running? - Turn the. - Turn the - water on. - - Water on. Nicolette? I'll see you inside, and let me know if you have another plumbing emergency. Frankie. Frankie! Turn the water on. What was that? Can we just get the trunk unloaded? Come on you giving me indigestion just watching you for Christ's sake. What's the matter with you tonight? Guess who I am now? Hmm? Godfather or mob hit? Every time you suck on an orange, we gotta talk about this? Come on, d'Amico's a pansy. You gotta problem with it? You gotta problem with it? Imagine Brando saying it. That's what I'm saying. Everything sounds better when Brando says it. Got enough food there, Lou? Yep. I don't get this place. What's to get? Business with no hassles. Somewhere to meet and greet. Open up a sandwich shop. This place don't look so hassle-free to me. My father god bless, if he was still alive, imagine him walking into some Mexican joint? Forget about it. Tapas, it's a tapas joint. What does that mean? Can't get full? Hey I got a real spaniard in the kitchen from Spain. This ain't TV. We need to keep our noses clean. I know it ain't easy to take, but your old man was like a father to me. On his deathbed, who does he ask for? His nephew, so bravo, you're the boss. I'm living with it, but it's like my father slapped my face. He loved you Lou, and I can't say it more plainly, business is business. So come on, have another drink. Want some more food? Want some dessert? Hi Caesar. I love this place. Even their bathrooms are done by artists. What's with the toilet fetish? Nothing, I had some problems, alright? ♪So tired of playing all these games ♪I don't even wanna know your name ♪cause we're deep in this mire ♪and my heart's fighting my mind ♪taken by taken by ♪desire ♪desire ♪desire atavistic altos, thank you. Buy the band a beer or seven. Seriously, you guys like rocked, and you, so sexy. You'd kill on American idol. But you know what, you guys should seriously consider closing with a classic. I don't know, like Sinatra or something. What? You're in Jersey. Or you could close with an Italian folk song. I have this Cuban friend who kills with guantanamera at the end of her set. We're rock. She's rock. You have to spice it up a bit. Don't think she didn't try. Oh my god, she had an accordion one night, remember? So please, don't encourage the ethnic. It nearly sank us. It wasn't that bad. You want ethnic? No. Here we go. I have a contact on mob hit if you guys want a gig. Thanks, but no thanks. I think someone needs to protect the Italian heritage. Are you serious? The Italian heritage is in Italy. - I'd do it. - In a heartbeat. What? I got nothing. Come on, you must have a little something in order to reel this one in. Hey, you were amazing. Oh, thanks. Did you hear what they say about everyone wanting to fuck a rock star? Let's go. You are an important person. You are in control of your destin- Mr. b, one of the girls left you her card. That'd be gagoots. Saw the way he was looking at me at the wake. I should have dropped him right there. Oh, whoa, you got proof? Hey maybe it's him, maybe it's not him. There are lots of folks challenging power these days, especially new power. You know sun tzu says- he can kiss my tush. I don't need my after dinner mint to be made of lead. I'll take care of it. See ya. You got something to say? If I did I woulda said it 25 years ago. Shoulda been me you know. Comes time for a new boss, just saying, it shoulda been me. Remember to pick up the sausage tomorrow. Oh shit. So uh, Carlos knows a guy, Arturo, who's gonna help me hit the frozen food angle from a whole new direction. Basically brand the food I've eaten for my entire life. Did you hear what I just said? Yeah, mob hit. I have no idea if your new friend had anything to do with it. I mean, she just mentioned it last night. She's a whore, but even she can't move that fast. All right, all right, I get it. You don't like her. I don't trust her. Like's got nothing to do with it. Any other show, and I'd be there, but this one, I gotta say no. It's your career. Which is apparently less interesting than frozen food. Come on, I was listening. Good news? Oh now he's listening. Relax it's a girl. Babe, I was listening the whole time. Okay? Get back to your silverware. Alright. Hey. I wasn't sure if you were coming. I wasn't sure myself. You're cleaning the patio. Does that mean there's no lunch? Come on. You're probably right about finding a sicilian song to close with. I'm just paranoid since it bombed. Well I'm not talking three songs here. I'm just talking one. And a short one at that. And you know you could try a fun song, but with sicilians, you're probably better off sticking with romantic notions of invasion and death. Nobody'll understand the words, just find a good beat. I got a letter from mob hit asking me to audition. Seemed a little suspicious. If you're asking did I recommend you, yes. But you just saw me play. So? I knew you were quality the first moment that we met. And if I'm being totally honest, I'd like to get you out there. I don't think that's such a good idea. I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded nice. I said that I was joking, and the rest is just what's right in front of you. So you wanna talk about the wedding, eh? Getting cold feet Francesca? Uh, yeah. Um, no. It's huge, right? Committing to someone. Up to now, Tony and I shared our dreams with each other, but we never had a shared dream. You know what I mean? No, not exactly. Like, I had a dream about being on the cover of a chart-topping album, and Tony, he has a dream about his mug on a box of lasagna in somebody's freezer. That's weird, right? Well, do you feel like there's room for both? I just don't wanna wake up one day without a dream of my own. Then don't ever stop dreaming. It's not that easy. This friend of mine wants me to audition for mob hits, which I know would be amazing exposure for the band, - but- - Have you heard? We have some of the cast members for our parade. That's great, right? No. No? But I wanna involve the young people, and this is what they enjoy. That's the problem. What kind of message does it send that Italians worship murderers and thieves? Christ himself embraced murderers and thieves. Jesus forgives mobsters, Frankie. And so should you. Ma. Uh, this is my Japanese cooking instructor. Just getting a little rice off your lip? I'll let myself out. Okay. You hungry? No. You know when a kid tells an Italian mother no, she feeds 'em anyway, right? Why? Because she's an Italian mother. That's what she does. Baby, I know you're trying to find your roots and all that, but this Italian mother is tired, so if you say you're not hungry, I meant good. I thought you said you weren't hungry. You said you were tired. Oh, I cannot believe she who? That singer? Frankie, yes. That would be her name. You're banging her? I'm banging, what? I'm banging her, really? No, vin, she's just talented, okay? She could use a little push in the right direction. What? She's engaged. Since when's that ever stopped you, Nikki? Yeah, but you know, this one's different. How about getting your father to come to set? You think I can get the real stuff from a book? Can you stop whining? You know I hate whiners. Everybody hates whiners. You're whining. That's what you do. You whine, and you know what, I honestly don't know how you pull it off on set. But I do right? Right? Right? Can you give her another shot or what? Yeah, probably, I'll see what I can do. See? Doesn't it feel good helping out other people? Like you'd know. Shut up. Thank you. I wasn't whining. Still whining. No, I'm not whining. - Whining. - I'm not whining. Whining! A little more of that olive oil bronze please. - Hey. - Hey. Um, thanks for meeting me. Yeah, sure, what's going on? I just talked to my friend at mob hit. He said that he'll forget that you turned down the audition and give you another shot if you'll take it. What part of no aren't you getting? The n or the o? Frankie, it's a really great opportunity. National exposure. I think that you should take it. Look, I brought you a DVD. Have you ever seen the show? Ever? Knowledge is power, Frankie. Whoa, are we tailing her or her ass, ledoux? You know who she is, right? Yes, I know who she is, which is why I'm confused. These two girls hanging out. I don't know. Something's fishy. Pig. What? No, I didn't mean it that way. I meant it the regular way, but that's funny though, fishy. Yeah, you know about fishy, bumping uglies. You've gotta be kiddin' me. Come on! What you need a little love injection there, ledoux? Huh? Let me ask you a question. Are you the lipstick or the dipstick? Okay. You gonna go grab her up or you gonna sit there and wet-nurse your balls all day? I might sit here and wet-nurse my balls all day. - Thank you very much. - Yeah you're on the clock. Get out. Hey you. Excuse me, FBI, can you get in the car please. No way pervert. Nice jacket. Hey, ledoux. Thank you. Francesca del Vecchio. A little odd, don't you think? You find the body, then go to the wake. Show up buddy, buddy with the daughter of the new jefe in Brooklyn. Don't you mean capo di capio or don or I don't know something Italian? We're watching you. Yep. Hope you enjoy the show. You're buggin' me at home, what is it? Listen, we're having a problem with tom. I know like 20 Toms. You know Tommy one-nut. Tommy one-nut from Brooklyn? Or Tommy one-nut from the Bronx? Who's Tommy one-nut from the Bronx? For fuck's sake. Whoa. Bad enough we got a guy with one nut. So, Tommy from Brooklyn, who's an acorn short, what about him? He wrote a check he can't even cash for Lou Lou took his action? I just said that. So no action, alright? Yeah, alright. Not unless that jerkoff gets straight. - I said alright. - Listen we're getting hungry. Where can we get some cavatells? You can't start a fart around this neighborhood without hitting a fusion place. Yeah, look what they done to that pizza grotto. Vindaloo pizza my ass. Disgusting. Green olives and black olives. What's going on? You seem like you're in another world today. No I'm fine. Oh hey, can you bring the big muff pedal to rehearsal later? Yeah, but I'm gonna be late. Again? You saw that gluten free shit, I gotta talk to a guy. - I got. - - Ah, yeah, yeah, how 'bout you just kiss my big muff pedals? Lina. Enjoy. Sit. Sit. Hi, ladies. Can I get you something to start? Big muffs. Hey. Yo, you guys must be so stoked about mob hit. - What? - Yeah! No I turned them down, I was- no, at it, you can suck my with your anti-defamation bullshit already. - What did he call me? - Camille paglia, maybe? Give me something to call him. Frank, pussy. He called me a pussy? Yeah. - Go fuck yourself. - Yeah I know that one. You don't remember me, do you? ♪ Always sunlight on my face ♪it feels so good don't you know ♪I can see heaven oh, fuck ♪no matter what you will go I have not been out to the rockaways since hurricane Sandy. This is crazy. Yeah, you think things will last forever. I guess it leaves space for something new. Mhmm. So the feast, I heard that you're doing a dance class. Yeah, the pizzica di cuore. Ah, pizzica from the heart. You know it? Yeah, of course I do. At the end of the dance the woman gives her scarf to whoever steals her heart. So my mom's got a birthday coming up, and I don't know what to get her. I want it to be meaningful. You know to say something about us. Okay. So what's the first thing you think of when I say family? Having dinner on the table, I guess. Everyone laughing, a big pan of lasagna. Ah, that's my mom's best dish. What's your favorite? Piece? The corner. Of course it is. The driest slice. - That's it. - What? That's the gift. You get her the best lasagna pan money can buy, and then write her a card and tell her exactly what you just told me. But she hasn't made lasagna in like a year. Yeah, but it's the thought that counts. True. Eh, it's what I would do if it was my mom anyway. So why is that? Just think it's important, you know, family. Hey can I ask you something? Yeah. What's it like? Growing up in a family that's in the life. What are you talking about isn't your- so when did you get into the whole Italian pride thing? Was it always that way? What way? Alright, alright. After my dad left, maybe. I get it. When you miss somebody, sometimes it's but think about why. Can't believe the boardwalk's gone. I know. ♪I've been mixing hope and doubt ♪I've been changing and I don't how it's pretty. Well minus the somethings. What? I love it. Let's do this. What is it? Uh, you know just, I don't know. I'm going through this thing. Tony he's putting you through the ringer. I'm telling you everybody that's getting married, it's always crazy. Maybe not really Tony. I have a friend who um brought some things to my attention, just reevaluating some stuff. A friend? The whole time I've known you, you've never written a song about a friend. Well, she's a really special friend and- oh my god, it's that girl. What? That girl. She is just my friend. Frankie! She's just really great. - She... - - Oh, yeah. - She's fun and. - You like her. She's fun and fiery and free and everything I'm not. I mean, she speaks Italian, and she cooks Italian. Does Tony know? She might even be in the mafia. Are you kidding me? - I know. - You can't even watch mob hits. Your girlfriend's gonna be a mobster? I don't have a girlfriend. Oh my god. You're crazy. I love you. - Kat. - Frankie. Well, between Tony and my family and his family, I mean, I cannot put a girlfriend on my plate so you don't have anything to worry about, - so can I just write a song? - - Oh my god. Play the song, play the song, come on. Start it over, from the top, let's go. Oh yeah, it's gonna be called "you, Tony, and your girlfriend the mobster." It's gonna be called "mob hit." You are off. - Can we just play the song? - Let's call it mob hit. It's our newest hit. Oh amazing. Not a word. You gotta problem with it? So? I'm intrigued. Okay. Intrigued is good. You hungry? After that, not really. Whatever. I fixed a meal you could choke Caesar on. Come on. If I didn't do it, I'd have to hire someone, and maybe I don't want other guys in my yard. You got a birthday coming up. Are you ignorant? Why you gotta remind me of a birthday when I'll I'm thinking is I'm one step closer to the grave and I got nothing to show for it. You know, you may think that you've gone all Asian fusion, but your attitude is pure sicily. Frankie is engaged. She's gonna be gone soon. Heather, well she may hang on until I'm horizontal, but you don't gotta remind me of a day that I don't wanna celebrate. You know, doing this made me think of the old days when we'd make a big pile of leaves, throw the girls in, roll around with them. Yeah, well, in the words of Buddha, "be here now." These plates are amazing. Thanks. I have the whole collection. They belonged to my mother. Past tense, is she? No, she went back to sicily when I was nine. But that's not why I asked you here. I can't get you out of my head, Frankie. You know, I've been thinking about you too, but not in that way. You're stuffed shells weren't that good. Weren't they? Um, I'm sorry. That was so uncalled for. Smells go- dad, hi, you remember Frankie? Yeah, I met you at the wake with my sister, Heather. I'm real sorry about pinky. - Your sister? - Yeah, Heather. Yeah, you and she, you close? - I guess. - You know Mr. Roma? - Son of a bitch. - Huh? Don't play cute. Watch yourself, sweetheart. Dad what the hell? I need to speak with you alone. I'm so sorry about that. - Nicolette. - Okay, I'm coming. You don't have to be rude to my friend. Tell you what, something big is going down, and that girl knows something. What's she gonna know? Daughter could talk. What? It's not like the old days. Women, they know shit now. Women always knew shit. Still no one's talking. Yeah, whatever. Fine. Know what? I got another idea entirely. No, you are not gettin' this one. Really? Yep, big idea for one, right here. Such a kiss ass. - Louie. - Hey. Hey, keep going, keep going. You look great. My wife gave me this kind of thing for our anniversary- yeah, but you ain't got a wife. It's gagoots. I wasn't sure before, but now, he sends a girl over to spy on me. He's goin' through my daughter. His business has sunk to a new low. No, look, it's not Sonny. I saw that girl getting out of a federal car. I don't believe this. I can't even wax my salami in peace. Whoa, you're doing this girl? Her sister, Christ. Even the females now. What's the world coming to? There's an old sanskrit saying, "you can't hook half a chicken," "and expect the other half to lay eggs." Shut the fuck up. Just sayin', it's all down hill from here. You know who this girl is? Should I? Come on, we're done here. Come on get off this thing. - Alright, here we go. - Come on. Something in the groinal region just, you got me? I'm working out way too hard. Hold on, oh yeah, take it easy. I know, I know I'm late. I got caught up watching mob hit. Yeah, yeah, I just, I gotta grab a clean a work shirt, and then I'll be there. Alright. Tony. Hey! Hey. Ever hear of a broom? It's 10 times faster. Why is faster always better? I don't know what's gotten into you lately. You wanna sweep, fine. Bet we could find a broom inside. Didn't think so. Looks good, right? All I see is mob hit. The red sauce looks like blood. I can't believe you watched it. Where the hell were you? I had the most amazing stuffed shells. Is that an answer? No but that is. I'm reconsidering the audition, what do you think? Oh wow. Tastes like feet. It could be better. Yeah, could be fresh, hot, steamy. It burnt my fingers? On the plate. Hmm, what happened to fresh, hot, and steamy? - What? - Speak to me in Italian. You're not serious, are you? Hey. Nicolette. Hello. Yes, I know, I know what you had to do to keep her band in the running for mob hit. I'll see what I can do about getting my dad on set. Hey. Did you know that your door is unlocked. Did you know that you're drunk? Clearly. What? Come on, Frankie. Did you mean it? The kiss? Is that why you're here? What if I said maybe? I like maybe, but maybe is a lot of things. Maybe is... Full of possibility. Babe, you're drunk. Let me call you a car. You're wincing. I'm not wincing. Would you let me work on your frets in peace? Go sing for my grandfather. You know he loves that shit. Please? Your frets'll be done when you get back. Fine. Be good to her. I'll be right back. Go on, go, go, go on, go. Put the a at everywhere and the d at- Bellafusco thinks you called the hit. Now why the fuck would he think that? You were supposed to divert- oh, oh, I understand. Gagoots, we got move on this quick or you're a dead man. I'm a dead man? You brought me into this. No way I go down alone. There you are, Francesca, you wanna sing for dad? What the fuck? Hey grandpa, your nurse is here. He hates when they send a male nurse. Not that I can blame him. I saw that girl right there get out of a federal car. Ah, get the fuck out. Hey, Francesca. Hi, Mr. Roma. Good kid, she sings for my dad. Now look I'm just saying, I saw her get out of a federal car. She's a girl, a nobody. My son fixes her guitar. Your bookie's kid? Nickel Mike? Plus she's been hanging out with my goddaughter. Oh, from what I've heard, she's a- look I'm just saying, gagoots. You keep an eye on her cause she ain't right. I hope my guitar is safe in your car. Trust me, it's fine here. Hey Mike. How you doin'? Isn't that your dad and- ah, my uncle Louie, yeah. They don't like me hanging around here. He's your uncle? Well, my second cousin actually, but he's my godfather and old, so. He's your godfather? Oh, of course he's your godfather. Come on, come on, please. I'm from the neighborhood. My mother, she's, makes a very inadequate ziti. This is insane. Why did you bring me here? I know all these guys. Thought you might want to play to an appreciative crowd. You know, test some folk songs so you don't shoot yourself in the foot at a real gig. Shoot myself in the foot? Why not just right between the eyes? Thanks to you, I'm not even sure if I have a band. - Nice going. - Fuck you. How about fuck you mafia-Donna. Be my guest. What is that supposed to mean? Uh! So this is like my seventh message. I can't believe you just left me there. Seriously? You took my guitar. So Tony dropped by and left something for you. Oh my god, what is it with this guy and lasagna? I say one time, one freakin' time that I miss mom's lasagna, and now I'm up to my ass in it. I think it's sweet. I love Tony. This is gonna be me. A gangster's goomah. I know it doesn't take a lot of genetic material to make an entirely different human being, but really Heather, really? You know I slept with him, right? Who? Caesar. Who? What? Well no wonder he looked at me weird. He was probably like, "oh, your sister's got nice tits." Hey. But he said that? Did he? It's all fun and games now, but wait until you get older, you'll see. I miss dad. Me too. You're gonna be married soon. You know what, we're going out. Really? Yeah. You have to change this whole entire outfit. It's horrific. What is this cowboy vest? Got it at goodwill. Exactly. Oh come on, Heather, you're not parking a semi. I can't believe I'm trying to one-up laughlin. I'm the superior here. Oh my god, and I'm totally talking to myself. Ugh, I must be tired. God it's hot in here. I hate menopause. Son of a bitch. Holy shit, it's that kid again. Oh, these two girls are up to something. No shit, laughlin, and I'm gonna find out what. Hey, it's- here we go. Showtime. A hit? On who? I can't say. Why not? Life is dangerous enough for you without actually knowing what the hell is going on. Is that sarcasm? Cause that was pretty good, for you. Heather, Francesca. Do I know you? Get your hands off of me. I know you have evidence. You have a recording we need. Leave us alone. You guys think you know everything. It's creepy, and I'm getting no credit here for not blowing your pervert friends' cover, so before you go asking me what I know, here's a news flash, nothing. Who are you right now? May I remind you girls, this is a federal investigation. You don't bring it to us, we come to you. That was amazing. You know, if she won't talk to the feds, maybe Sonny is playing me. Did he set me up? If he talks to Caesar, oh geez. My shitty luck always. Oh! Honey, bring me ice. Your sister sounded pretty shaken up, or excited, with her it's hard to tell. What's going on? I need my guitar. Right now? Tomorrow might be too late. What is that supposed to mean? I just need my guitar. - Forget about it. - Forget about it? You don't say forget about it, - Frankie- - I said forget it, okay? Your sister said something about the feds. If the feds show up and something goes down, I'll never get it back. This is associated with that? No. Dad it's my les Paul. Don't be ridiculous. She just had a fret job. Excuse me? I just need my guitar. I'll take you. Fine. You know I'm not seven anymore, right? Stop acting like it. We're not here. Live large. Leave a message. Look, I think your lovebird's gonna chirp. What the fuck are you talking about? Your breakheart manicurist and her sister, they're dirty. I got proof. All right, thanks. Hey, Nikki. About your friend. What now, dad? Who else is here? Mr. bell- what is this supposed to be some kind of distraction? Oh my god, where's your? It's around the corner. Hey, do I look finished? You ever heard dry cleaning? It relaxes me. Oh yeah, you look real relaxed. Frozen lasagna. I'll get you a washcloth. What do you know? Okay, you know that saying, keep your friends close and your enemies closer? Ow, ow, ow. Yours is up your ass. What is? Ow, god. It's Nicolette's uncle,. I know the pudgy guy. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Frankie. Ow, fuck! Shit. Where's my daughter? Hey, stop it. We're leaving. You know she just wants her guitar, right? Is that why you're here? Ridiculous, all of you. Come on. You sure about what you said in there? Take a listen. Here. Where'd you park? You gotta get that horn changed. What did you give him? Dad, I'm just trying to protect you. Hey, I'm gonna ask this one more time, and out of respect for me, I need you to answer. What did you give him? - Answer me! - All right. My mp3 player. Recorder thing, you know. Do you know this guy? I'm trying to figure something out here. Alright, I need to tell you something, and I don't want you to get all nutty on me. Can you handle this? I don't think I can handle any of the things I've been handling. Alright. I don't really work at the daycare center, I just, I make book out of there. I take bets through basically that guy. I work for gagoots. I tried to shield you girls from it. I'm sorry. I just didn't need you to know that I was in the life. Wow. Come on, Frankie. Let me drive you home, come on. If anything happens, your mother'd choke me with wasabi. Does she know? Of course she does. Come on, you're not safe now. Actually, it looks like I never was. Couldn't you just leave me alone, dad? I saw you with your dad, Frankie. You okay? You wanna talk about something? Um, right. Maybe I shouldn't have come here. Wait. What? What is this? Do we really have to know? I think I need to know. I don't know. I can go if you want me to go. No. I'm not sure. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Hey, babe, where are you? I've been trying you all day. Alright, I'm gonna use a key. Talk to you later. I'll be inside. Frankie. Oh, hey. What are we doing? What? We can't do this. My god, I had cake with a priest and a Jesus statue. What are you talking about? I, I'm not, I'm not gay. This is not how my life is supposed to be. This is not me. I can't be who everyone who you and my dad and your dad and oh my god, and Tony. I can't be who you all want me to be. I'm sorry. Notice anything strange about Frankie? Yeah, everything. Like the fact that she's obsessed with Italian culture or she has uneven nails or that she prefers gelato over Ben and Jerry's. What? No I mean anything that I would consider strange. That's not strange? I'm not letting you go. Have to. Hey, there you are. I've been trying you all day. Where you been? Uh, the studio. You could at least answer your phone. Uh, you know, I really can't do this right now. Do what? I have to get to nonna's. I promised her I'd pick up the pizzelles for the feast. Wait, I thought we were going together. Can I just meet you there? Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Wait, are you sure everything's okay? Tony, I said I'm fine. Jesus. I'm sorry. I just have a lot going on, okay? Engagement? I really don't wanna get into it, okay? Okay, yeah, sure. I'll see you at the feast, all right? Don't take too long. And next year, my lasagna gonna be at the feast. - Lasagna. - Yes, lasagna, lots of freakin' lasagna. - - That's what we're gonna feast on. Ma, your cantine is a mess. How old is this can of tomatoes? Hey, that's my gravy. Hi, aunt cheech, your mother's here. - I know. - You know why. Shhh. What? We're not talking about it? She's getting married. Let's talk about that. It's alright Zia. Stop with the sugar. Your gravy's always sour. Santa Maria. Francesca go taste it. See what it needs. I should really get to the feast. Besides, my stomach's not right. Oh, Frankie, your father, he never wanted to hurt you. I don't get it. When I was little, he took me to belmont park and had me place a bet. There were all these long lines and- I know where this is going. - Windows and. - Let her tell her story. Then he took me around the corner, and there were these three small windows and no line. He says, "this is where you collect your winnings." "Think about it." His father took him to the track in Saratoga. What he was a said there. You didn't miss anything, cheech. Your father missed it. It's a good story. It could end better like your gravy. I'll be right out Sofia. I just gotta put a couple things together here. Thought you might be hungry. Looks nice. Thank you. Espresso? No, I don't drink it any more. What do you drink? Green tea? No, but hey, I can run down the block. Hey look, I'm not sure that they have it. You did it with the lemon rind in the sugar. Yeah. So what's so important? Frankie got herself in a little bit of a jam. I had to fess up to our girl. Frankie was in a spot. She was at the don's house, and I had to tell her what I do. Hey, hey, hey. Hey no. Yeah, step on up wildcat. No way. A Vincent d'amico bobblehead. Cut ya deal. Hey. Come on you got this. Oh, getting close. Watch how you flip your wrist. That was way- win the prize pretty girl. Move it. We got a winner. I'll take the bobblehead. Yes. It's precious. Pizza here, fresh hot pizza. Slice of pepperoni coming up hot. I don't suppose you want to share something? Shut it. Right, shutting. You know this is all just a big mistake. Hating the mafia is so like last week. Oh, hey sweetheart, why don't you help me find Nicolette? I got this. What are you doing here? What am I doing? Jesus, Frankie, are you really that blind? I'm in love with you. - What? - You're gay? Hey Caesar Bellafusco, sick. Holy shit. You really are. I ought to ask you for your autograph. Then I'd have to kill you. You're better looking on TV. Got a problem with it? Dad, the answer is yes. Come on, Frankie, let's go. Used to be so simple, you know? It was loyalty, regard for certain ways. Frankie won this for me. What? My daughter, Heather, absolutely no manners, but we raised her, so, who you gonna blame? Yeah. Hi Caesar. Charmed. I always thought I'd give her a huge wedding, you know? - What's he talking about? - I have no idea. My daughter. She's got a problem with my lifestyle, my lifestyle. Now I find out she's got a lifestyle too. Lifestyle? Oh my god, she's, she's a vagitarian? Your daughter's a lesbian? What's that say about Frankie? Our Frankie? She's engaged. - To a man? - Yeah, to a man. He's a fricking frozen food entrepreneur, why? This calls for a family meeting. Your mother and I are divorced. We don't do family meetings. But you still love her, right? Yeah, he still loves her. You're not gonna call me again? No. Did you? My god, he's- yeah, I know. And not to mention that he's old enough to be- he's my age. And the woman you were seeing when you left mom was how old? Come on, intervention time. I wonder who signed up this year. Maybe nonna is making another appearance. That's it. Not another word until you tell me what's going on between you and her. There's nothing to say. A girl just told you she loved you. What's wrong with her? Nothing is wrong with her. Will you just stop it? Stop what? I gotta go to the dance. You coming or not? What is going on with you two? I don't know. She's my friend. I don't know. Well, you better figure it out. Paison, make your way to the staging area. It's time to pizzica. Sing the unsung, heroes Italiane. Nicolette. Pizzica. Ma! This is what I get for getting pregnant before I was married. What? I mean what did I do to deserve this? A cheating husband, a gay child, and this one, a- kid who slept with a mobster. What? Give it a rest, ma. We all got problems. Ma. This is your fault. I mean are you really gay? It's cool because now I can screw up as much as I want. Nope. Take some lessons mommy-to-be. What? Don't come out to your Italian family during the feast. Not for nothing, but the girlfriend's hot! I'm really- sorry, Jesus. You let her go. She's trouble. What about gagoots? You're more worried about a couple of females. Oh, you wanna go after Sonny, we need proof, and I'm just saying, those girls have it. Yeah that thing with the general, I'm on it. Come in. I'm here to see Nicolette. Come here. How'd you get this? Little gino works on my guitar. You know he gives a really great fret job if you ever need one. What? I don't wanna know. So I was there, you know, getting - a fret job. - - Yeah, whatever the fuck fret job thing. Yeah, and he told me to go sing for his grandfather. He likes to hear old stuff. So you know Roma? You sing in Italian? Yeah. Uh, my ex-wife used to sing in Italian. Okay. And I went to the courtyard and that's when I heard it. Oh, maybe they set Louie up. Maybe you work for gagoots. You know gagoots is a really stupid nickname. I'm not debating that. I don't work for him. I'm a musician. I play guitar. You make money off the old stuff. Not exactly. You should get a band, play weddings. I had a band. A lot of money in weddings. We were rock and roll. Uh, so you uh, looking more wedding band, you don't mind my saying. Actually I do. Now can I go see your daughter? She went up to bed. Good. I'm sorry about that comment. The mafia Donna thing. It was wrong. Really Frankie, that's what you're sorry about? We should talk. What the fuck is that? Modern technology. You're gonna wanna hear this. You carrying? Come on, give me more credit than that. Hello. Hi. Is your father inside? Jesus you skeeve me out. A male nurse is a- no, I just, I care about your father. See, right there, that's what I'm talking about. You're fired. What? Yeah, fuck it. He's my father. I can care about him. Now get the fuck out of here. - Sir. - - Go! What? It's your father. Eh, come on. Scoot over. You're hogging the whole sink. You have the tiniest bathroom. Oh my god, what'd I get on me. Just a little something. Wanna borrow some clothes? Yeah, like I will fit into your clothes. Uh, what am I gonna do? You're so beautiful. Well right back at ya. Don't forget to starch. I didn't wanna believe it. Why? Because we're family? Uncle Louie. What? You got someone here? Believe me. She ain't got a guy in here. I didn't s-what you know? Everybody knows. Cat's outta the bag. Hey, you're engaged. - Dad! - Jeez. - What the fuck? - Whoa. Son of a- yeah because we're family. Alright, alright, take it easy, take it easy. You FBI? Oh, me? No, Jesus. Don't take the lord's name in vane. Bout time gagoots. Wait a second. What are-the two of you? Let's go get some cannoli. Oh geez. And you wonder why mom left you. I know why your mother left. You planning to follow? What? This is my alternative? What? You wanna go to Italy? Do it. But you think she's gonna want a fanook for a daughter? I don't care what he thinks. He's a fuckin' beast. Least I know how to love. He's just, he can't even. I'm sorry. You're coming to the salon, right? Yes, alright already. Your hair is gonna rock. Hey. It's hard not to feel what you're feeling. What do you know about it? Not much. Enough to know that the more you try and hide something, the worse it is when it comes out. I am never going to forgive you. Okay. But I'm never gonna stop loving you, no matter what. ♪ Describe ♪come tight ♪this soul of mine can't be denied ♪give to me all you hold inside, you said ♪think with your heart not with your mind ♪your mind, your mind ♪so tired of playing all these games dad, it's Frankie.

I mean, Jesus, I don't even wanna think about it. Frankie stop. I do not get you. I grew up with this, okay? It's what I know. Be glad that you don't. You had the best mob experience that a kid could have. The oblivious kind. Your family wanted to protect you. That's what a family's supposed to do. How are things with your mom?

Hey, at least they're both Italian, right? I'm Italian. And she's a good cook. Hey, listen kid, I know you feel like shit, but trust me, stick to business. Family meal is shot, all you need is a convincing photo. Your own mama Celeste. My mom hates photos. It doesn't have to be your mother. Jeez, Tony, think outside the box. Come on, Tony, give it a shot. No time to cook, frozen food like you've never had it before. Tonight, think outside the box. You know what, the sacrifice thing didn't work out very well for me. What do you mean? When you made sacrifices for me, it worked out great. Hey, Sofia, your husband still loves you. Does anybody want Espresso? That'd be nice. I used to come here when my parents would fight. To clear my head. It wouldn't have to be like that. You think they were always like that? They were in love once too. Do you still love me? That's like asking me if I love my family. Meaning? You're my family, Tony, but part of family is knowing what to keep and what to leave behind. Hey, you hated my hair anyway. I was getting used to it. Leaving you is not going to be easy, is it? If I could stop you, I would. Look, I know the Bellafusco girl likes more than your cupcakes.
