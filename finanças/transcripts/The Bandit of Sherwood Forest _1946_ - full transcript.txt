Comrades, I've called you together again because the people of England face a grave crisis. Many years ago, as Robin Hood, I led you as an outlaw band here In Sherwood Forest. Together we resisted the tyrant King John. When he dled, we dispersed because we believed that tyranny had died with him. But tyranny did not dle. It merely slept. And now It has awakened again. It's the same tyranny, different only In name, and Its name Is William of Pembroke, the lord regent. Now the lord regent calls the Council of Barons to a special meeting at Nottingham Castle. As the Earl of Huntington, 1 wlll attend. But no one knows what the outcome willl be. But If he dares try to destroy the rights glven you by the Magna Carta, we must take up our swords again. You, Little John, my old comrade Friar Tuck, Allan-A-Dale, WIII Scarlet - all of you. Together we will fight this new tyranny. I've sent to Huntington for my son Robert. Ever since he was a lad of ten, I've trained him for such a time as this. We meet here In Sherwood Forest, day after tomorrow. Ho, the guard! A horseman approaches. The Earl of Huntington! Lower the drawbridge. These are the reasons for my dissatisfaction with the England to which I have been called as Regent. A boy king under the Influence of his mother, a government weakened by the terms of the Magna Carta. That, however, can be changed. A weak king was forced to surrender to the terms of the Magna Carta, but we should not continue to be bound by such cowardice. The powers that king gave up, I shall take back again. The people are not fit to rule themselves, therefore I am withdrawing the Magna Carta. From now on, the people will be taxed as they should be taxed and ruled as they should be ruled. It will be necessary for each of you to place his armed men under my command. I ask each and every one of you to do this at this time. - Lord Mortimer, you're first. - Yes, my lord, of course. My men are at your service. - Fitz-Herbert? - You have only to request. Thank you. - Lord Frederick? - Certainly. Lord Warwick? Er... l should like time to think It over, to conslider... - Are you questioning my right? - Oh, no, my lord, but... Good. I knew I could depend upon you. - My lord, may I address the councli? - You may. I have sat here hardly believing what my ears hear or my eyes see. Have you forgotten that English blood was shed to galn the Magna Carta? Does It mean nothing to you that thousands of men have dled for the people's right to rule themselves, to tax themselves, to live In liberty and In dignity? Now the regent asks you to take away those rights. And you are ready to agree. How can you face your famliles, your friends, and all those people you wlll betray, for one ambitious man? Or, If you will not think of others, you must think of yourselves. Today the regent calls on you for help because without you he Is powerless. If you grant the regent what he asks, he wlil need you no longer, and he wiil turn on you and destroy you Just as surely as today he's destroying those whose only protection Is the Magna Carta. If you refuse the regent, you'll be your country's heroes. But I warn you, If you give In to him, you'll be history's blackest traitors. You're still eloquent, my lord, but the world has changed. 20 years ago, as Robin Hood, you gathered a band of men who did as you ordered. That Is no longer possible. The men who followed you then are too old for fighting now. We are not moved by your eloquence. If you wish to live In England, It'll be the England that I govern. I would rather leave England. Mllords, the Earl of Huntington Is banished from this land. His wealth Is confiscate. Should he be found within England past sunset tomorrow, he wlil be hunted down like any other outlaw. You see how easily It Is arranged? - Your Majesty. - My lord. I must speak to you alone. - Lady Catherine, will you stay? - With Your Majesty's permission. Of course, Lady Catherine. The regent has abolished the Magna Carta, has banished me. - No, It's not possible! - Shh. Fitz-Herbert followed me. - I'm not leaving England. - Where wlll you go? Men are gathering In Sherwood Forest. I Joln them Immediately. - What are you going to do? - What I did before when there was tyranny. Fight It. The first time the regent moves toward the king, send word to me. My son Is but a chliid. He wouldn't dare harm him. You must realise the danger Is great. The council does his bidding without question. As his power grows, he'll become bolder. No one knows how far he'd go. Therefore I pledge my life for your safety and that of the king. And If I cannot redeem my pledge, my son will. Robert? He's but a boy. He's a grown man now. He's In the North Country. I have sent for him. We thank you. Know ye! By order of William of Pembroke, Regent of England, from this day Magna Carta Is abolished. Tyranny! Death to the regent! Death to the regent's tyranny! Was It the solitary horseman again? I've discovered who he Is. The son of the Earl of Huntington. The son of Robin. I sent you o clean out Sherwood Forest and bring me Robin Hood allve or dead. - Exactly... - And all I get from you Is excuses. - But my lord, I... - Now, listen to me. Bring those traitors back soon or I'll hang you. - Now have you anything to say? - No, my lord. - Then get on with It. - Yes. On your way out, look at the gallows and remember It may be for you. If I were king, no one would resist me. They wouldn't dare. Proclaim yourself king. It's the only way to restore order. Do It now. Patience, my friend. There are obstacles to be overcome. - The young king? - For one. Boys are frall. They often do not live to full manhood. One step at a time. First Is to separate him from his mother. My Lord Regent. How dare you enter my apartment unannounced? You seem to allow outlaws privileges you deny the regent... Your Majesty. - What do you mean, sir? - You think I'm unaware that the Earl of Huntington had a conference with you In this room? I answer for my actions only to the full Council of Barons. To you I need explain nothing. It's regrettable that you think so lightly of my authority. It forces me to exercise It with greater firmness. What will you do? Your strange sympathy with outlaws proves you unfit to be trusted with the care and education of the king. I am removing him from your Influence. - You wouldn't dare. - Mother! Mother, they're taking me away! They're taking me away! Mother, please! You can't! You can'! Mother! "Can't", madam? - What are you going to do to him? - Your son Is England's king, and therefore my responsibility. 1 shall see that he's well taken care of. Catherine, they've taken my son. I know, I was listening. You must leave at once. Leave? With my boy In the regent's hands? What are you saying? We know he will stop at nothing. You must get away, Your Majesty. Tonight. I couldn't. I'd be deserting him. As long as you remain here, you're powerless. You must go to Robin Hood at once. Robin Hood. We leave tonight. There's a boat waiting. Dash through the gate as soon as It opens. Thank you. What's wrong? This crank Is stuck. = I'll help you. Thank you. She... She worked all right that time. Ah, Just your muscles were stuck, not the crank! You're getting too old for this kind of work. Mm. Maybe you're right. - Well, I'll lower It for you. - Thank you. My Lord Regent, the queen has disappeared. Disappeared? Are you sure? She's not In the castle. I sent a search party after her. - How did she escape? - The gate. There's no other way. Hang the guard who let her through. And put two men on the postern. Yes, my lord. It's too dark now. We'll return to the castle. What are you doing here? Hunting. It's pleasant. I like the trees, the flowers, the water. And, uh... ..the muslc of the birds. - Wl you please go?! - But I Just got here, and I like It. - Well, I don't! - Careful. Logs are slippery. Oh! Well... put me down. - Aren't you going to thank me? - Thank you?! If It hadn't been for you, I... Put me down! You know, you're really very pretty. - I could easily... - Ooh... Oh! - Can't I be of further assistance? - You've done enough, thank you. What's a pretty girl llke you doing all alone In Sherwood Forest? If you must know, I work nearby. I'm a scullery mald. Oh, with slik stockings? - You're very observant, aren't you? - When there's something to observe. Catherine. The woods are full of scullery malds. Glorious England. - We'd better go. - Why the hurry? The pots and pans can walt. Can't they? Come, Catherine. - What are you afraid of? - They mustn't find us. - It's too late. They've seen us. - Were you looking for these two? Yes. They led us a merry chase. I thought It suspicious for two women to be wandering. So I detained them. Good work. You'll get a reward for this. Thank you, sir. - Help her up. - Yes, sir. Permit me. You've really earned that reward! - Come along, woodsman. - Yes, sir. Just one moment. Let go of those bridles. - Have you lost your mind, woodsman? - I sald let go. You'll hang. They're under arrest by order of the regent. That's why I won't let you take them. YOU won't let us? Why, you... It's a long way to Nottingham Castle. I suggest you start running. I sald run! Woodsman, we owe you a great deal. - I've already been repaid. - I'm very sorry. I didn't know. Since when has the regent been arresting scullery malds? They'll return with more men. We'd better leave. We'll go on alone. We'll be safe when we get to Robin Hood. Robin Hood? We can go on together. Is this his home? No. All of Sherwood Forest Is Robin Hood's home. But you'll find refuge here while I go for him. - It Is a quaint place. - As quaint as Mother Meg herself. You'll find her a very charming and gracious old lady. Begone! I want no thieving vagabonds In this house! Charming, Isn't she? - Open up! - Who are you? Who sent you here? Now, be your sweet self and open the door. Or must I break It down, Mother Meg? - How did you know my name? - Open the door! Put that broom down, you old witch, or I'll take you over my knee. Don't you recognise a friend? Friend?! Spy, more likely. 1 don't know you or them. - You knew me once, you old crone. - Begone! - These are friends. Scullery malds. - Put me down! Down, you blackguard! Now, you listen to me, Meg. Make your guests welcome. Go to the cave In the back of your house and bring some rare old wine. - How do you know about the cave? - There's little I don't know. Do as I tell you or Robin Hood shall hear of how you treat his friends. Robin Hood? Oh, that black scoundrel! Save that prattle for the regent's sples. Goodbye, sweet one. See? Could I leave you In more gracious hands? We've come a long way. That wine would be refreshing. Wine? For scullery malds? Water, and fetch It yourself! - What's this? Get out of my way. - Oh-ho-ho! - You're In a hurry, youngster. - Yes. To see Robin Hood. Oh, now, forgive me, sir. What makes you think Robin Hood wishes 10 see you? You should be able to guess that, Little John. And how do you know my name Is Little John? There's only one man with such a blg body... and such a little mind. The child seems blessed with second sight. Tell me, what Is my name? Mm, Allan-A-Dale, the minstrel. - Now wlll you step aside? - Certainly. For any man who fights as bravely as he talks. With all my heart. A crack on your thick skull may release the cloud from your brain. Hold on! Desist! Disturbing Heaven's peace! Shame, shame, Little John. Are these the manners I've taught you, quarrelling with a babe In arms? - Who's a babe In arms? - A man full grown. A fighting man, squabbling with a little boy. Little boy?! One moment, Friar Tuck. Little boy?! Why, you great tub of lard. Were It not for your holy office and gigantic waistline, I'd crack your seams wide open. Pass me a meat skewer and give me spitting room. Stand back whlile I teach this whippersnapper a lesson. - Why, that's Robert. - Your boy? - Yes. - You'd better stop this, then. Why? The boy can take care of himself. - Tub of lard, am 1? - Yes, a double tub. I'm a double tub, am 1? - Save your breath, old man. - Old man?! Another stroke or two and the boy'll have him In the dust. Stuck. Care to try a boy's sword, ancient one? Shame on you, Friar. It's your duty to chasten our souls, not our hides. It Is I who am chastened. - Roblin, do you know this lad? - Know him?! Gentlemen, this Is my son. Your son? A girl and a woman? You've no Idea who they are? I know they're not scullery malds. - How? - Thelr breeding glves them away. Thelr hands are well-kept. Thelr speech Is not of the kitchen. You're very observant. Is the girl pretty? See for yourself. Go away. Quickly. It's all right. You needn't go. Meg, my sweet, where are your...? Your Majesty. Majesty? The queen. The queen?! Dearle... me. And so I came to Sherwood Forest, and to you. All that remains of free England - you, your son, your men. No one else Is free. No one else Is safe. Not even my own son. Not even England's king. - The king wlll be safe. - Aye, that he will. What my son means, madam, Is that we wlil see to his safety. That so long as there's one free spot on this Island, that spot Is England. There was a tyrant that Sherwood Forest conquered. It will do so agaln. We wlil not rest untll all of England Is free. So help us God. Thank you... all. We'll storm the regent's castle at daybreak. We'll do nothing of the sort. Look. We make a very little flame. A hand could cross us out and never even feel the burn. - If we refuse to be snuffed out... - Then the flame wlll grow. It'll grow untll It brings every honest man In England to our side. - And where do we start the fire? - In Nottingham Castle. But we must know the regent's every move. We need someone there. ' Go. No. Not yet. Allan. Men who are glven too much power sometimes abuse It. They make mistakes. The regent's mistake will glve us our chance. As a minstrel, you'll get Into the castle. Send word as soon as you can. 1 w"I, Roblin. Your Majesty. Your Majesty, we have taken the first step. You have my deepest gratitude. How can I ever thank you? Mistress. Your Majesty, If you... If I could help... I'm not a lady-In-waiting by trade... With you beside me, I know I'm In good hands. Come. Mother Meg and the queen. We're living In the age of miracles! It's late. We must get back to camp. Good night, Lady Catherine. - Good night. - Good night, Lady Catherine. - Lady Catherine. - Yes? Oh. Good night. Walt. I, uh... - I owe you an apology. - An apology? Yes, for what I... when you... Ahem. At the pool. Oh. Oh, you saved us from the regent's men. Is that what you mean? You know very well that's not what I mean. Well, that's all I can remember. In that case, I don't owe you an apology. Good night, Lady Catherine. Robert? Robert. - Yes, Lady Catherine? - I... l really do remember more. Do you? And... l didn't terribly mind. In that case, I'm ashamed for you. Why, you...! - Try the other cheek sometime. - Oh! Lady Catherine! Catherine. Sleep well, Lady Catherine. There, there, lass. Don't be frightened. You're safe now. - I'm not frightened. - Then why the tears? Oh, It's that blockhead Robert. I could have slapped him. - What did he do? - That's It. He didn't do anything. He's as stubborn as a goat. He's a devll. He's Just like his father. When Robin Hood was young, he used to make all the women hate him and love him at the same time. Well, I hate Robert. That's a sure sign that you love him. Hold. We're being followed. It's only the chiid. Believe me, I use the word respectfully. 1 didn't expect you so soon. I'd have lingered for a pretty face. - You don't understand women. - 1? 1 don't understand women? You'd be surprised how they've changed In 50 years. Fif...? Rlots, chaos, confusion. This boy can never bring order to the country. I's time we had a new, more powerful, king. - We dare not, my lord. - Dare not do what, Sir Mortimer? - 1 thought... - You thought wrongly. The king Is about to abdicate. In fact, I've already prepared a proclamation. - The king wlll sign It? - Why shouldn't he? Take It to him now. He's playing In the garden. Oh, but... do you think he'll sign It? Certainly. He's a chlid. He finds It difficult to understand. Say It's a detail of government. He's used to signing such documents. Yes, my lord. He's fond of Mortimer. He won't question him. - A brilliant Inspiration. - Come. Let's watch from the balcony. - I have something for you to sign. - What Is It? The regent sald It's a mere detail. The regent? I won't sign, not unless my mother tells me to! But you've always signed the documents. I won't! Not while my mother's away. Mortimer's a fool. Send the sheriff to me. Just a little more time, my lord. Just a week more, I beg of you, both Robin Hood and hle eon. Robin Hood? That wasn't what I wanted to talk to you about. - It wasn't, my lord? - I'm worried about the king. He seems disturbed In his mind, unhappy since his mother went away. Even now he's crying In the garden. He needs a change of scene, don't you think? - Oh, yes. Yes, my lord. - Put him In the west tower. Of course... My lord, that's where we put the prisoners. He'd enjoy the view. See that he's taken there at once. - Yes, my lord. - The west tower's very high. If the boy were to fall from there, he might be Killed. There's that danger, but... I'll put up some bars... No, no. That won't be necessary. I can almost see him standing there, looking out of the window. You're beside him. Your hand Is on his shoulder. Suddenly he falls. You understand? Oh, no, I... l couldn't. I couldn't. - You must. - Oh, no. No, not the young king. I... I... No. No. Walt. You did look at the gallows as I told you? Your neck would snap llke that. Well... when must I...? When will he... Tall? Tomorrow night, after the changing of the guard. Tomorrow night I shall be king. Good shooting! Llke you 20 years ago, Robin! - Well done! - That's archery! Some soldiers at the castle do as well. But, of course, they're picked bowmen. Light these In the fire, WIII. Throw them In the alr, one at a time. - An arrow s a slender mark. - It's a hard shot, boy. Ready? Throw. - Did you see that? - Amazing. - It's marvellous. - That's a true son of yours, Roblin. Robin Hood! Robin Hood! The king's life Is In danger. They plan to klil him. The regent. Hey! Save your anger. We'll have need of It later. We'll tear the castle down! There's no other way. We must get Inside the castle. They'd lower the drawbridge for the Prioress of Buxton. - What? - I stopped her on the road today. - You didn't harm her? - The head of a nunnery? No. She was anxious to get back In time for evening prayers. - I don't see what she has... - One of us poses as the prioress. Others as her attendants. If she falls Il along the road and asks for refuge In the castle... Why, of course. I hope the prioress Isn't known In the castle. - No, I don't think so. - The plan wlll work. You plck the men you want to go with you. The rest of us wlll walt outside the walls and help you get the king away. Who'll be the prioress? - WIII Scarlett! - In skirts? You understand women. You'll be very convincing. - With this beard? - Why not use a real woman? Who? Your face Is known In the castle. You'd be recognised. The prioress is ill. She can keep her face covered. No, It's... It's too dangerous. If strangers come to take the king, he may cry out and rouse the guard. - He'll trust me. - I told you no. I'll make preparations. - Tell him to let me go. - It's Robert's plan. He must make his own decision. Robert, please. There's nothing more to be sald. It's too dangerous. - For whom? - For... For success. Robert. I lled to you. The soldiers at the castle don't shoot as well as you. Really? Not even the best bowman? Robert, I've told the truth. Why won't you? There are too many things to attend to. - The real reason you don't want... - I must arrange disguises, horses... Robert, you're In love with me. What were you saying? - I love you, Catherine. - I love you too. That's why I must go with you. - Together. - Together. - The road Is guarded past here. - Then It's time to separate. Let's go over the plan to be sure everything's understood. Take your position opposite the west tower. I'll be Inside the castle. Allan-a-Dale wlill be listening for your signal. When he hears the hoot, we'll begin work. If anything goes wrong, we'll cover your retreat. Good luck to all of you. God watch over you. I wouldn't glve much for thelr lives If It goes wrong. Sending his own son... Ho, the guard! A party approaches. Slump In your saddle, Catherine. Remember, you're Ill. The Prioress of Buxton has been taken 1ll, and asks to stay the night. Walt. The Prioress of Buxton. 11l and asking for shelter. Lower the drawbridge. Your quarters will be prepared. Follow me. God will reward your kindness, my son. - Leave the castle tonight. - So suspicion may not point at me? - Stop at the Golden Pheasant Inn. - I'll leave at once. Guard. - Who are they? - Prioress of Buxton. She was taken Ill and asked for shelter. This Is most unfortunate. Strangers In the castle. Church people? Most convenient. Witnesses to the fact that the king dled by accident. Of course. There's a beast they call a camel lives only In the Holy Land. The crusader told me that this animal can drink enough ale In one sitting - to stay drunk for seven days. - Not possible. He swore he had seen It with his own eyes! Well, what a beast can do, a man can do! Innkeeper! - Yes, sir? - Lodging for the night. And food. The mutton's roasting, sir, but won't be ready for a quarter hour. Bring us some ale. And be quick about It. Yes, my lord. An Innkeeper Is slower than a snall. Nixon. You'd better stop drinking. We're staying here untll morning. - Why? - I thought we were riding to Buxton. The prioress changed her mind. I'll never be as good as that camel. Do you serve the Prioress of Buxton? 20 years, wherever she went, but never away from home so long. From Buxton to Leeds to Manchester to Oxford. Nine long weeks. Now, Just two hours from home, she decides It's too late for travelling. - Is the Prioress of Buxton a guest? - Yes, sir. She has already retired. Drink to the regent's health. A gold plece! Into the bedchamber, quick! Our men are waiting at the moat. Here Is a plan of the castle. This Is the west tower. The window of the king's chamber faces the battlements. How many guards outside the king's door? Two. My bosom comrades. I've taken great care to cultivate thelr frlendshlip. Stay In the shadow of the walls. They've posted guards here and here. - Any on the wall below the tower? - One. Good. When you reach the king"'s chamber, signal me. Then stand back. I'll shoot an arrow through the window. - An arrow? - With a length of twine attached. The twine wlill be fastened to a rope. Allan wlil keep watch while you haul It up. Then you take my place at the door, while I lower the king to Robert. - I'll follow after I've lowered you. - Is that everything? - Everything. - You can start now, Allan. Little John will call when It's time for you to go. I'll be waiting for you at the top of the tower steps. I thought I wouldn't be afraid, Robert. If anything should go wrong now, we might never see each other again. Nothing wlll go wrong. Welcome, minstrel. What about some music to brighten up a long watch? Why not? It's time. Remember - keep In the shadow as you cross the courtyard. ♪ Let the back and the side go bare, my boys ♪ Let the hands and the feet go cold ♪ But give to the belly, boys, beer enough ♪ Whether It be new or old ♪ Sometimes we lle like hogs In a sty ♪ With a flock of straw on the ground ♪ Sometimes eat a crust that has rolled In the dust ♪ And are thankful If that can be found ♪ Let the back and the side go bare, my boys ♪ Let the hands and the feet go cold ♪ But give to the belly, boys, beer enough ♪ Whether It be new or old ♪ What are you doing there?! Hurry. I'll warn you If anyone comes. - Lady Catherine! Is my mother here? - I've come to take you to her. - Where Is she? - We haven't time to talk. - You must do exactly as I tell you. - Yes! Anything! Dress quickly. Stand back! It's Fltz-Herbert returning. It's Lord Fltz-Herbert. Lower the drawbridge. Lower the drawbridge. Quickly! It's too late to stop him now. Be ready for trouble. You watch the corridor, Lady Catherine, while I lower the king. - Take care of the king. - Aye. - Courage, lad. - It's a long way down. - But I'll be all right. - Yes. You'll be all right. - The strangers are Imposters. - Imposters? The prioress Is at the Golden Pheasant. - We'll visit this prioress. Come. - Look. Look! - Where are you going? - To stop them. Walt till they're all In the moat. Then see that the king Is killed. Take some guards to the tower room. Capture anyone who's there. Robert, what's happened? - Hurry, Allan. Something's wrong. - He's almost down. They've seen us. We"ll have to Jump. We haven't time for that now. We'll have to go this way. It's too late. Break that down! Go on! Allan, get ready. Catherine, get back. The king escaped, but we captured three of the outlaws. - Hold them. - Yes, my lord. This has forced me to act sooner than I thought. Find all the barons In the castle. Bring them to the council chamber. My lord barons, as most of you know, the king has been abducted. Tomorrow morning, each of you wlll depart for his estates and return as soon as possible with the armed men under his command. Together we shall then ride to London. Before the week Is out, 1 shall be crowned king. The council Is dismissed. Mortimer, have the prisoners brought In. Yes, my lord. The last obstacle has been removed. Why was not Warwick here? I don't trust him. I Intend to get rid of him. My lord, here are the prisoners. Lady Catherine. The queen's friend In the company of traitors. Too bad. Too bad that I'm forced to hang a lady as a common criminal. - On what charge? - Abducting the king Is high treason. The king was not abducted, he was rescued from the murder you planned for him for tonight. How boldly these traitors lle. I was outslide that window when you gave the sheriff the order. I heard every word you sald and you can't deny It. Take them out and hang them all. Just one moment. I still have the right to dle with a sword In my hand Instead of a rope around my neck. - What glves you that right? - The law of trial by combat. - That law Is reserved for nobility. - 1 am of the nobility. - You? - The son of the Earl of Huntington. Robin Hood. So you are the son of Robin Hood. I could hang you on the gallows, but I owe your father a grudge. To klll his son will glve me pleasure. Your life Is too precious to England. You will enjoy this traitor's death no less If I slaughter him. Thank you, Fltz-Herbert, but this Is one thing I wish to do myself. Take these prisoners to the east tower. You heard. Go. 1 think you're making a mistake. Five men trled to capture him. He killed two. You can't fight him. Three days without food and water, he'll be very weak. - You think I'll have much trouble? - No. A brlillant plan, my lord. Brilliant. Mortimer, you've a long Journey ahead of you. You'd better leave early. Yes. Yes. Rise for the regent. Rise. I've come to tell you the trial by combat Is to be held In three days. Hm. To give yourself three more days of life. I'm giving you three days before you dle. When I klll you, I hope your sword wlll be as nimble as your tongue. Three days without food or drink wilil slow up your tongue. And your sword. No one's to see this prisoner. He's to be glven no food or drink. Yes, my lord. - Glve me the key when It's locked. - Yes, my lord. - Robert. Robert. - Catherine. Come to the window. - Where are you? I can't see you. - I'm In the next cell. Are you all right? Did the regent do you harm? Harm? He Just decided he wouldn't die today. Please, Robert. I heard everything he sald. Well, don't you realise a little hunger sharpens a man's wits? Speak up. What happened to my son? I told you before, I don't know. You've questioned me for hours. I know nothing. Let me go! - The regent would... - Shall I, Robin? No, for heaven's sake. Your lordship... - No, WIIL. It's my pleasure. - No! - Robin. - Thank you, Your Reverence. In the old days, you'd have clipped his ear neatly. I'll try agaln. No! No, I'll tell you. Your boy Is safe. He's still allve. - What wlll the regent do with him? - I've told you all I know. - In that case, I might as well. - No, walt. He challenged the regent to trial by combat. It's In three days. - Who's fighting for the regent? - The regent himself. Oh-ho! The regent... If he's fighting Robert, there's trickery planned. No! No. Don"t klll me. Do you really believe I would? To think you're an Englishman! Robert. - Yes, Catherine? - I have some food for you. - What? - Part of what they bring me. Oh, no. You can't do without It. Please.
