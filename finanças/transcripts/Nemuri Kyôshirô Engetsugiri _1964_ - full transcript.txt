Everybody run for it! C'mon! Hurry! Splendid! A superb "Kikuichi-monji Bizen-Norimune" bladel. Kikuichi-monji Bizen-Norimune: a "chrysanthemum-crest" sword created for Emperor Go-Toba by Norimune of Bizen Province. Young Lord! Father! Father! Father! S... Somebody! S... Somebody, please! Father! Father! Father... - Another man's been killed Otetsu! - Another one!? We can't ply our trade here when something like this is going on! Father! Who... Who could have done such an awful thing!? Father... There's a samurai over there! He's the culprit, I'll bet! Dammit... No, Tajuu! This man had nothing to do with it! Who knows?! He could be an accomplice! Right! Samurai are all the same! If... If I had been here... my father wouldn't have had to die... Bastards! Samurai are all the same! Even our village deputy just sat and watched us poor farmers starve! Now we're refugees, not allowed to live outside the camp! That's the excuse samurai use to come here and test their swords on us! They think that we're a bunch of maggots or something... This guy must've come here to kill us for the fun of it as well! - Let's kill him and cut his head off! - Yeah! Damn you! This is proof that I had nothing to do with it... It's a bamboo sword. He's not your average samurai! Withdraw! My apologies... for not making it worth watching. Oh, it's good to see you again, sir... I hope the bamboo sword hasn't inconvenienced you, sir. - Are you finished? - Yes, sir. You're the best swordsmith in Edo, after all... Good workmanship is no surprise. It is a fine, rare piece, sir... ...but I just can't force myself to like it. It emanates evil... It's as if it is in the habit of killing. Oh... let me... It's alright. I'm no customer, you know. But... Okita... shall we call it a day? - Do you think we should, sir? - Don't you mind me. Don't be cruel! Oh, sir... why don't you relax here a bit. Just speak the truth, Okita... I know I'm being a bother... It's written all over your face! - Oh! - I shall see you tomorrow. Thank you so much... Why did you make me wait for you for three days?! Was that Gototei Kunisada? Gototei Kunisada: a famous painter and creator of woodblock prints. A print of me will soon be completed. You must be quite popular... Looks like you'll get around a lot more than when you were a geisha. I couldn't care less about that. What interests me is... I've come under orders from Sir Katagiri Saburo Takayuki... My name is Konami. Would you please come with me? Sure. Kyoshiro... Don't worry. I doubt it's anything erotic enough for you to be concerned about. If you'll excuse me now... Oh, sis! Are you done with your work? I must apologize to you about the earlier incident, sir. Please... follow me. Please sit... Nemuri Kyoshiro... Rumour has it that you're quite a swordsman. You guys could've ended up dead earlier. - Insolence! - Hayato! Have you been a ronin for a long time? I have never had a master. I might consider hiring you, if you'd like. That's a once in a lifetime opportunity for you. Sorry, but I'm not interested. Watch your mouth! I won't permit you to speak like that to Sir Katagiri Saburo Takayuki. Why not? He'll soon become the next Shogun! Yeah, I saw you... Two nights ago, under the Yanagiwara Bridge. What are you talking about? According to the criminal statutes of the Shogunate... ...he who kills to test a sword shall be beheaded before the public. There'd be riots if people knew what you did, and you weren't punished. Wait... For a mere ronin, you seem to be carrying a fine sword. What kind of sword is it? A Muso Masamune. Muso: void of emotions. (Okazaki) Masamune: a famous swordsmith. Let me see it. Won't you let me see it?! I collect rare swords. Sell it to me! I'll pay whatever price you ask! I'll give you my sword in return, as well! If you're trying to acquire the soul of a samurai... ...you shouldn't go around killing poor peasants like they're helpless ants. Is this how unacknowledged bastards of the Shogun act? The samurai of today have sunk low, low enough to... ...gamble, fight unnecessarily, steal, and murder. Your Shogun father Ienari sired dozens of children on his concubines... ...and then there are the extra odds-and-ends like you! Some fools pimped their own wives to the Shogun in pursuit of favours. Your mother was one of those wasn't she? - Shut your mouth! - Same to you. Young Lord! Please let me handle this, sir. You want to challenge me? I'm Toda Hayato... Uragasumi lai style. Uragasumi lai style: the art of quick-draw sword fighting often from a seated position. Lai? I'll fight you. - You would? In lai style? - Correct. Don't you know that Toda is a master of the lai technique? Kyoshiro! Your Muso Masamune... I will not rest until I have it! I'll keep that in mind. I heard that his youngest daughter got kidnapped! Obviously, somebody's got a grudge against him! No doubt about it, I love this! They say that the kidnapper walked with a limp. You really are a moron... What made you think of kidnapping a baby girl this time?! - Should I return her? - Hold on! If it's true that the samurai who killed your father is in love... ...with the child's older sister, whom he made a housemaid in his mansion... ...then, this is the girl who'll be inheriting her father's estate. Looks like this is gonna get interesting! Over there at the House of Yamazaki, they must be worried sick! I wanna go home, Mister! I wanna go home! You little brat! Want me to spank you?! Clear the way! Clear the way, will ya! Tajuu! That samurai form the other day is back again! What do you think you're doing?! Move it! Hurry up! - C'mon! Clear out! - What now?! Wh... Why are you here?! I hear that you wanted to kidnap the older daughter... ...but because she resisted, you ended up with the younger one instead. I don't know what you're talking about! The kid hasn't done anything wrong, has she? You again is it? Wh... What's so funny?! I... want to challenge... the samurai who killed my father... ...in a man-to-man... duel! How did you find out who he was? Me. I put him wise to it. He's a little slow, you see. Using a child as a hostage isn't a very bright idea. Oh, you've got a better plan? Our enemy is a powerful man, after all. Katagiri Saburo Takayuki. So you know. You're just the same as him, aren't you? Where did you hide the girl? I don't know what you're talking about! Had you managed to snatch the older sister... ...her lover Katagiri would have shown up right away. But the young one isn't much use to you. Not necessarily. We're talking sisters here. If the older sister, Konami, tells her lover about the kidnapping... ...then he will show up. You've figured it out nicely. They were gambling the other night in one of the inner rooms of his mansion... ...and so I went there disguised as a seller of daifuku. Daifuku: rubbery snack made of rice with a sweet bean-paste core. I heard everything from the guy I screwed that night. I see. So you won't change your mind. Could you sit still... ...if somebody killed your father... like he was some bug?! In this case, you're an ant going to war with an elephant. On the other hand, it might be something worth watching. Are you gonna get in our way? Depend on it... Yes... Dammit! What's wrong, sir? - His Highness is in trouble! - The First Heir is in distress! It's an emergency! Sir Mizuno... is this a warning... ...in your capacity as an Elder of the Shogunate? No... ...as an Official Guardian of the Shogunate's Sons. In addition to today's mysterious death of Lord Nariyoshi, the shogun's heir... ...in recent months, both Lord Naritomo and Lord Narimune... ...two other sons and heirs of the Shogun, have also met with... ...untimely ends, one after another! Then there is the matter of the violent conduct of your son, Sir Takayuki... ...and your blatant and imprudent remarks that he will be the next Shogun. Such things might excite unneeded suspicions in the public mind... ...and place your House under undesirable scrutiny. Out of concern, I wish to bring these matters to your attention. I shall not obey anyone's orders regarding Takayuki. Honourable Elder... I've raised Takayuki... to be a brave man. Today, the world is full of samurai who've forgotten the way of the warrior. Such imperfect and mediocre men are all we see these days! If things continue, the Tokugawa era will soon be at an end. I've raised my son to be a true... a true warrior... ...and I understand that this means some will think he is violent. Yet, that very thing... is something that I am proud of. He who shall become the next Shogun... ...should not be anything like Lord Ienari. Am I not... correct? Lady Matsujo! I'm only telling you the truth. The Lord Shogun made me, the wife of Katagiri Geki, his liege vassal... ...and master of a 4,000 koku fief, bear Takayuki... ...thus besmirching our reputation... and when my husband passed away... ...he gave us this shadowy mansion and a stipend... ...in order to still the tongues of the mother and child. But I won't tolerate this anymore! Just watch me, Honourable Elder. I will see to it that Takayuki escapes this... prison of a mansion... ...and that he obtains the exalted rank... ...the post of Shogun! How is your collection of great swords coming along? I just saw an incredible piece... ...a Muso Masamune! I'll show it to you soon. 'Tis a time of peace... ...so I'm sure it will be difficult for you to test it's sharpness. Elder, you are indeed sly! Oh, have you discovered Tsuru's whereabouts? Well, sir... my men, and the townspeople have been diligently searching... but... Konami, you saw the culprit, did you not? Yes... Initially, he came after me. He had a limp... and looked like a beggar. Any ideas? Sir Takayuki... Tsuru is Konami's sister... I would hope that you'd treat the matter as if it were Konami who was gone. I know that! I ask, Sir Takayuki, for your assistance... ...in the recovery of my sister. - Please... Such a nice breeze. It's a wind from the void. The plaintive voices of the dead... ...emerge from beneath the graves, and can be heard night after night... Oh please... You're giving me the creeps! You know... I can never figure out what's on your mind... Your husband, that's what. "Banzo" is his name, didn't you say? Please don't say it... I don't want to be called a "wife" anymore... you know that. I know. Right now... I'm happy beyond belief... Now that he's killed a man and been sent off to Sado Island... Sado Island: a penal colony. ...there's no way that he can come back alive. I can't continue to love a man... ...who is a good as dead. Am I wrong? Isn't that the truth? "Who can continue to love the dead...?" I know I cannot. And those buried out there agree with me, I'll bet. So the day will come... when I die... Hold me... please, hold me... hold me tight... ♪ "Walk on, walk folks, hey..." ♪ ♪ "What lane is this my friend?" ♪ ♪ "This is the lane to the Tenjin shrine." ♪ ♪ "Allow us to wend our way there." ♪ ♪ "Those without good reason may not pass." ♪ ♪ "When I celebrate my child's seventh year..." ♪ ♪ "...I'll be back to offer my thanks to you." ♪ Mister, I'm hungry! I... I know... I haven't eaten anything since breakfast either. But, I'm used to it so... ...here, take this. You're such a fool. What if they find you here? Well... B... But... I know, I know... You wanna say how cruel it is to keep her inside, right? Yeah... - That's so like you. - Can we get her some... Aren't you hungry too? I'm fine! Here you go. Tajuu! Tajuu, c'mon! C'mon! C'mon! It's that Yakichi bastard! Good evening, officer. - Hey, where's Tajuu? - I wouldn't know. Sheesh! Good evening, sir. Listen up! Because you're poor peasants, I've been lenient in the past! But before you do anything stupid... ...keep in mind that Ishikawa Island prison camp is a hell on Earth! Just remember that I can send all of you there to rot! Officer, why are you in such a bad mood today? Oroku, what the hell are you doing in here?! Oh, please! You know damn well that we ply our trade here at the bridge. How creepy! It ain't dark enough yet for ogresses to be out and about! Move it! - Eat up, Mister. - No... it's all yours. No, no! I'm alright! I know you're hungry, Mister! Eat up! What's wrong? - Return the girl! - N... No! Return the girl, then challenge the culprit face-to-face like a man. I'll let you fight Katagiri Takayuki. You lie! S... Samurai say nothing but lies! - This isn't a lie. - Dammit! Stop! Hey, everybody! Hey, everyone, let's get him! Damn you! Wait, everybody! S... Stop! S... Stop, everyone, please! Y... You're gonna hurt the kid! Stop! Tajuu, go get him! We'll help out! I... I'm giving up! I was wrong to do this. It doesn't matter how much you want to get your enemy... ...you shouldn't use a child to do it. No matter who you are... there's love between every parent and child. Besides... this is horrible for the girl! Tajuu... it's good that you've come to understand this. Damn you... Just try returning the girl! If you do, then I'll go kidnap her again! Think you can do it? You think that I can't?! Isn't that enough yet, sir? It's not enough... after all, it's your heir's ransom. Then, how about a thousand ryo? "Can a Tsuru live on for a thousand...?" What a bad pun. Tsuru: a crane. Cranes were thought to live 1000 years. Also, the name of the girl. 3000 ryo. You fool! Why don't you try kneeling and begging?! Had you done that from the beginning, that's all it would have taken! But, you see, we merchants must negotiate the price of every deal. No matter what the treasure... or even in a matter concerning our own children... ...everything must be priced, and dealt with accordingly. I understand that because you are such a good supply of money... ...the Katagiri family continues to kiss your ass. Preposterous! Sir Takayuki is a very important person, destined to be the next Shogun. And he is exactly what you're after, isn't he, Yamazaki. You did say that everything must be priced and dealt with. Yes, I did, didn't I. You rice dealers spend your time cornering the market... ...then you create shortages to hike up the price. When bad harvests occur... ...the poor farmers, who can't even eat what they produce, starve. You're using these ill-gotten gains of yours... and your own daughter... ...to insinuate yourself into the Shogunate. Society is now in the hands of the commoners. The weak are ruled by the strong. It's just common sense. A splendid ideology. Sir Nemuri! Follow me. Oh...! Daddy! Thank you, lady! Go now! Good-bye! Tsuru! Tsuru! - Look! - Huh? Oh! Thank goodness you're alright! I, too... had a child like that. I felt sympathy... for the girl, you know... Oh, screw it... Better to forget about children and all that! And I'll... cheat men as much as I can! "I tried to cheat, but instead was cheated..." I heard that line in a song. How silly... So a man used you and then discarded you, right? I ended up giving birth to a child too. Where is the child? Dead... That's enough! I can't take any more of this! Business! Back to business! Well, how about it... Feel like spending money on me? No! K... Konami! No, Young Lord Takayuki... Don't you know... that we'll soon be husband and wife anyway! Until the day you become Shogun... ...I cannot seriously comport myself as your wife! "Seriously?" Don't you have faith in me? Damn you, Kyoshiro! I've been watching your lusty quarrel... It was a splendid sight. Your sister, Tsuru, is back home safe. Y... You must've been behind it all! Silence! I'm not talking to you. Insolence! What's wrong with you? You're not your usual berserk self tonight... The Muso Masamune... when are you gonna take it away from me? Are you going to kill me? I don't slay anyone who's defenceless unlike some people I know. - Intruder! - Intruder! Kill him! Kill him! Go after him! Stop! - Tajuu, get outta here! - Yup! - Intruder! - After him! Tajuu, try to return home without attracting their attention. Yeah, this time I won't goof up. Two intruders, one of them a ronin called "Nemuri Kyoshiro" or something. How could you let them get away?! - Were you defeated? - Not at all! Really? Then, you're saying you were the victor? You let some ronin successfully invade our mansion... ...and you were unable to apprehend him! This is pathetic! To be defeated is a shame far worse than death. For you, nothing is impossible! Anything can be had if you want it enough... be it an enemy's head... ...or a woman... Dammit! You swine! You speak as if you come from a samurai family. Hard to believe that you're merely a commoner. If I pull that rope... ...you'll be spitted on the points of a dozen spears... ...and this time for sure, you won't live to see another day. For a woman, you've got some nerve. "Woman..." "Commoner..." A petty ronin such as yourself has no grounds to belittle me! Your infatuation with becoming the wife of the Shogun... ...is but a misleading pathetic dream! Each one of us finds peace in ourselves... that is what we call "happiness". Is it too audacious a dream, as you say... ...for a commoner such as I to aspire to sit at the top of society? For me, such aspirations pose no difficulties. I'm going to have you... Oh! I haven't seen you for a while! Are you here on official business? It doesn't matter, please go in. "Nemuri Kyoshiro?" That is correct. Why do you need him slain? I'd prefer if I didn't have to provide any details. You're saying that this is for the sake of the Katagiri family? Yes. Very well. The late Sir Katagiri Geki did me a great many favours... ...and so I am eternally grateful and indebted to him. If you accept the request, Sir Yorii... ...the order to have you transferred to Kofu Castle as a guard... ...will be rescinded. Sir Takayuki will ensure this will happen. Why, I'd appreciate that very much. Even though I am and always will be a loyal vassal... ...given my tiny stipend and lack of official duties... ...if I'm sent to Kofu, it's unlikely that I'll return to Edo in this life. Sir Yorii, if a fine swordsman like you cannot live up to his potential... ...it is a sad loss for us all. I'm a fool who... still treasures the true samurai principles... ...which today's peaceful world has no need of. They say a hundred sho of rice will miserably feed six... 100 sho = 1 koku = 180 litres = a little more than 5 bushels. Because my stipend is just thirty, barely enough to feed two... ...I've as yet been unable to afford a wife. As you can see, I must grow vegetables in my yard... ...to flesh out my meals. One... Two... Three... Little girl... would you please tell your daddy that Banzo is here? Boss, it was such a surprise! Just when I was about to be shipped off to Sado... ...I got released! Even my wildest dreams were tame in comparison! I cut a deal to get you out of jail... ...but, officially you're still written up as "Exiled to Sado". If the constable sees you, all hell will break loose. - So you better be careful. - Yes, sir. I'll do that. You didn't get the nickname "Flying Squirrel" for nothing... ...so I doubt you're a careless fellow. Anyway, for the time being, here's a little something... Once the job is done, you'll be handsomely rewarded. Yes, sir. The "job" you want me to do... is an assassination, isn't it? By the way... Boss, what's Okita up to? Oh, she's working at a tea house in Ryogoku. She's about to become Kunisada's poster girl... Talk about popularity! Oh? Okita...? Banzo... it's her lover... that's who I need you to kill... - Huh...? - Nemuri Kyoshiro. I don't blame ya... for having a new man in your life. Okita... you're a very beautiful woman, after all... ...so it's only natural, the way I see it. I mean it. Forgive me... dear... Having said that... ...I wanna find out just what kind of man could steal your heart. I wanna see him with my own eyes. If I don't measure up to him... then I won't make a fuss. You'll let me see him, won't you? Okita? Okita? Hey! Oh! Okita! Oh, if it isn't you, sir. Welcome back. Say, Okita... You did read my letter from yesterday? You shouldn't kid around like that! I meant it... Okita! Oh, man! - Please, have a seat. - Don't mind me. Officer, would you like some tea? Sure. It's really pouring! Here you go, officer. Why... you're "Flying Squirrel" Banzo! - Boss! - Move it! Damn you! It seems that you've been following me for some time. Who ordered you to do so? I won't say. I have a pretty good idea. How much are you getting paid? I've received no money... It's a debt of honour. Oh? Now that's something I don't hear often these days. Don't you think it's foolish... ...to request a duel based on a debt of honour. Are you saying that for a samurai to repay such a debt is foolishness? A man like you, sir, is rare these days. As you know, today's samurai would rather... ...watch Gidayu than practice swordsmanship or study philosophy. Gidayu: an old term for "Bunraku" - theatre employing elaborate puppets. To tell the truth... I'm intrigued by your style. As you know, an opportunity to challenge an undefeated warrior... ...is a great privilege for a student of swordsmanship. While we were coming here, and now as well... I have noticed... ...your manners... your alertness... I believe that you are not merely an ordinary samurai. I'm sure that you've never been defeated either. - What is your style? - Maniwa-nen Style. I am Yorii Kanbei. Full-Moon Cut style. I am Nemuri Kyoshiro. The Full-Moon Cut style? After pointing my sword to the ground... ...I start drawing a circle. Before the circle is completed, the enemy is vanquished. No opponent has ever lived to see the circle completed. I shall challenge you! - Samurai are pathetic beings. - What? It's said that fireflies live for 20 days, cicadas for 3... There's no reason why you should die before your time. Debts of honour... allegiance... and swordsmanship... what nonsense! I value those principles. - Whilst living like this? - And, how do you make a living? If I'm broke, I make money by gambling. You will accept my challenge, will you not? You want to challenge me... no matter what? I do. Fine, then. There's not much left, but I'd like to... ...share a drink with you. - Are you alone? - As promised. You knew about this, didn't you? I choose to believe that it wasn't your doing. Prepare yourself. It's such a shame, because you're a fine swordsman... ...but you will die! I will see the circle of the Full-Moon cut completed. Now all the Shogun's eligible heirs are dead. Such pleasant news. The only one that remains is a 13 year old... ...a boy... a drivelling little idiot. No one else. I hear that Elder Mizuno has finally decided to schedule... ...an audience for Takayuki with the Shogun. Congratulations, madam. Konami... are you not pleased? Takayuki's fame reflects upon you as well. Yes... Are you feeling ill? You haven't been looking well lately. - You may leave us. - Yes, Madam. The wealth and power of the Yamazaki family shall influence us no longer. I cannot allow Konami's wilfulness to continue! I know that, mother. We're now in the crucial, final stages... We must eliminate anyone who interferes. Especially... that one name Kyoshiro... Masaki... you do know what to do, don't you? Yes, madam. He will be obliterated. The reason you want to say good-bye is... ...because your imprisoned husband is back again, isn't it? You know about that? What other reason could there be? I... don't understand myself anymore... He is your former husband, after all. Don't say that... It's strange how things are between men and women. Even if you were to betray me... ...if you did it for the sake of the man you used to love... ...then I wouldn't hold it against you. All I could do is remember you fondly. I'm... a horrible woman... ...a horrible woman! Say, sir, there's a boat that's been hanging around... ...but I know the guy in it, so... do you mind buying something from him? Sir Kyoshiro! - Look out! - Okita! Get away form him! - No... it's not what you think! - Go! Please... stop this! Sir Kyoshiro! Sir Kyoshiro! Sir Kyoshiro! Sir Kyoshiro! Sir Kyoshiro! I'm your husband, remember. Were you pleased that I was being packed off to Sado? Unless I... kill that Kyoshiro fellow... ...I can't walk around as a free man. Once I'm after something... I won't ever let it escape. Dear... I already have an idea... of where he might go. What...? You fool! Let's get him! Kill him! Why was I forced to slay... as fine a swordsman as Yorii Kanbei?! - Fellows, it's all on me. - No! 'Cause I'm w... 'Cause you're working right? Oh, c'mon! Don't worry about it! Foremen like yours are always stingy anyway. You can't possibly earn enough to eat as much as you want. - Don't be modest, alright? - Why, thank you very much! - Thank you! Say... bring each of these guys a bottle of sake. - Certainly. - Here ya go. C'mon! Have a seat! Alright? That's pretty nice of you. I'll just have to screw an extra pervert, that's all. Tajuu... wanna come over here? Come on over, Tajuu. C'mon! I know how you feel... ...but you don't have a chance against your opponent. I'll... face him and show ya! I know it's hard, but you should forget it. You should value your own life a little more. We've never been... treated like human beings... anywhere we've gone! L... L... Look at this! That's awful! Who did that to you? At the village deputy's office... ...when I said to them... "please help us... we are starving to death..." ...this is what they did to me! Is this something that samurai ought to do?! Not all samurai are alike. You're wrong! Y... You've all got swords! Y... Y... You use the swords to... to kill us! Are you just gonna keep standing there? Sit down! You know, I'm a loser myself... Lately, It's been tough emotionally to accept a customer, y'know... If only I were a little stronger... Three years in Yoshiwara, Two in Oka-basho... Yoshiwara and Oka-basho: famous red-light districts in Edo. ...and the last 5 years, I've whored in the streets. What's wrong with you? C'mon, drink up! - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, you guys! Let's drink up! Yeah, let's! Yeah, this one's on me! Who's there?! Come out! Okita is that you? You want me to hold you in my arms? No need for good-byes... we've already parted. I'm just offering to hold you. No questions asked. You're trembling like a leaf. Was that Banzo?! Why did you whisper... ...that he was hiding beneath me?! My karma is a bottomless pit of blackness. There must be some horrible devil living in me! We shall never... see each other again. But please... ...please remember once in a while that... there once was... ...a woman as sinful as I. Okita... "Five, Six..." Oh, mister! Gather around! Gather around, everyone! The Water Play is about to begin! Gather around, everyone! Alright! - Old man... - Welcome. - Two, please. - Certainly. I'm scared! Oh! Sis! Monsters pop out of there! You are ruthless... You've embarrassed me... saw my bare skin... For a woman, that is worse than death! Worse than death...? To endure my touching your body? I long to see you die! That day will come... Depend on it! Oh! Mister! What?! Konami...?! This time it's my other daughter! This is all the work of those who hold grudges against you! Why is that?! What Tsuru tells me is that... ...they're peasants who live under the Yanagiwara Bridge. - The refugees? - Yes. I'm sure that the peasants that you tested your swords on... ...are their relatives. It must be their doing. That bunch of maggots?! How ludicrous! Alright... They'll pay for this! Takayuki... I forbid you to enter such a place. - Why, mother?! - I will not permit it! You're a very valuable man, the one who'll be the next Shogun. Why make such a fuss about one silly girl? How can you say such a thing?! The House of Yamazaki has invested a fortune to support your ambitions! Are you saying that now you don't care what happens to my Konami? Lady Matsujo, please answer me! Young Lord Takayuki... You once thought of Konami as a part of yourself. And now you don't care what happens to her?! Alright... I'm going! - Takayuki! - Mother! Are you telling me to let that gang of vermin get away with this?! Let go of me! Damn you! Dammit! You scum! You've got some nerve, opposing me, a far superior being! I'll cut you into ribbons! Damn you! Wait! Don't come any closer, Kyoshiro! You want to rescue him? You want to save this fool's life? That's right. Even if you have to die to do it? If that is what you require. - No! Don't die just to save me! - Shut up you worm! Kyoshiro... I'll spare the life of this low creature. But there's something I want in exchange. What is it? The Muso Masamune. This is too great a sword for you... in your hands, the Muso Masamune would weep. Do you object to my terms? If you want it that badly... But, don't just leave him alone... ...stay away from all these people as well! Agreed. There's nothing in the world that I can't obtain if I desire it. The post of Shogun... And, Konami... you as well! Kyoshiro... I won't be satisfied just watching you die in a normal manner. In this cage... you will starve to death... ...ah... I wonder what that will do to a person such as you. How I'm going to love finding out! I must thank-you for the going-away present of flowers... ...before you proceed to torture me to death. Or perhaps, you want to stage a drama... ...a bitter legend of a samurai who saved a flower whilst starving to death? I wonder how long you can endure the production of that legend? How inventive! But, your bloated ego will eventually... ...spoil you, like thousands of others of the Inner Court. You'll live extravagantly... ...and fatten relentlessly, like a swine. Look at yourselves! Don' you care what happens to him?! But, they told us that if we get involved again... ...we'll be sent off to the camp on Ishikawa Island! They even ordered us to get out of here by tonight. Sheesh! I... I would sacrifice my life! I'll go rescue him! I am here today... ...with the news that you, Lady Matsujo, have so long waited to hear. The audience between His Highness, the Shogun, and Sir Takayuki... ...has been officially arranged. Lord Mizuno... is this truly so? I must warn you that the possibility exists there may be some interference. Sir Takayuki must not act recklessly. I would suggest that he employ great caution. This is a defining moment for us, after all... I will so instruct him. Kyoshiro... I hope that you're prepared. It will be interesting to see how you'll parry our spears... ...when you're trapped like a beast, inside this cage! This will be a bloody sacrifice to celebrate... ...the official presentation of Takayuki to the Shogun's court! Looks like the end of the world has come... ...if a unexceptional, dim-witted bully can become the Shogun. Silence! Is this a mother's love for her son? For the sake of your son, you abuse and victimize many others. You are a disgrace! Open the door! If you don't... Stand back! You despise me that much? You don't have any reason to despise me. - Don't let him get away! After him! - This way! Over this way! Don't let him get away! - Open the door! - That way! Go! - After him! He can't get far! - Yessir! - Yessir! Tajuu! Oh! - Did you come to rescue me? - Yup! You are a blithering fool! Let's go! Konami, did you... take the Muso Masamune?! Yes. It was I who took it. I had... ...let him... ...Nemuri Kyoshiro... have his way with me. What?! You've let him take you?! Yes. Takayuki... kill her! Destroy her! Oh! Young Lord! What's wrong, sir? We found this at the door... a request from Nemuri Kyoshiro for a duel! What?! Let me see it! "One ant's life is yours to take, under the Yanagiwara Bridge." "You may use any method you desire to take it." That damned ronin! - Masaki! Assemble the men! - Yes, sir. Takayuki, you must not go! Why not, mother?! Konami! Yakayuki! You must not go! Take your hands off me! Let me go! Takayuki! Can you not listen to what your mother has to say? Heed my words! Mother, you told me "One should always personally destroy one's enemies!" I must destroy Kyoshiro with my own hands, or I can't live with myself! Takayuki! No! I'm going too! It's my revenge! You'll only die if you go. I don't mind dying! Tajuu... on your behalf, I'll show them the strength of... ...a life that's been stepped on like an ant. What's wrong with that? B... But... you c..could get killed! You never know! I'll just have to do my best and see what happens. I... ...I love you, man! Tajuu... you're not the kind that belongs in Edo. Leave this town as soon as you can. Go back to you home in the countryside... ...and by tilling the soil, live life to the fullest. I'll... I'll go with you! Hey, he's here! He's here! He's here! Come on! Hurry up! Get on with it! Spread out! Hurry! Spread out! Hurry! Takayuki... it is commendable that you accepted my challenge. I applaud you for your courage. Silence! Kyoshiro! Your evil life will end tonight! Prepare yourself! Permit me to express the same sentiments to you. Young Lord! Young Lord! Attack! Go! The fire! Withdraw! Withdraw! Withdraw...! Shoot him! Young Lord! It's too dangerous! Young Lord... it seems as if we've succeeded! I must slay him... I won't be content... 'til my great sword drinks his blood... - Fetch my great sword! - Yes, sir! It's no use! Looks like... I've won this battle! Damn you! Takayuki... The Muso Masamune thirsts for your blood... Die! We've taken care of Sir Takayuki's vassals. Sir, we're in the employ of the Honourable Elder Mizuno. I'd guessed that such was the case. Fine... I'll fight you too. No. We have not been ordered to challenge you. Thanks to a statement written by a young woman named Konami... ...it was demonstrated that Takayuki and his mother were responsible... ...for arranging the assassination of the Shogun's heirs. - Konami...?! - That is correct. Matsujo has been sent into exile. - What about Konami?! - She has taken her own life. I see... Had I been defeated... ...then you'd have slain Takayuki. Such a fine, statesman-like manoeuvre. All is well now that I have slain your troublemaker. The Honourable Elder must have a big smile on his face. Such a pathetic fellow. THE END
