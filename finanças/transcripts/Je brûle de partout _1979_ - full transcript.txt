Well then... - Do the others know where we are? - Don't worry about that... There... Gotta pee... The light is on the left. - No, let go! - Very well... I liked to watch boys pee, when I was little.

Hello, Maria? - Lorna here. - Ah, it's you. No doubt, you've got something for Marcos. Ah, out with it then, and I'll pass it on to him... We have the perfect bird for him. - Sixteen and a virgin... - Ah, good job at finding a virgin. We'll get 100k for her. I would like to speak to the captain... Captain Marcos. A fine catch, this little one... Yes, indeed. She ticks all the right boxes. Already vicious. Perfect. So, apparently you're a virgin? Well, let's make sure... Legs wide open... Like so... so, then... Come on... There... good enough? Steady on... Come on... Let me do it... There you go... Shhh, easy now... Let yourself go... gently... Behave... Don't be scared. Come on. - Oh, it hurts... - No, it's fine... Come on, come on... There now. Alright, now I know it's true... - Here, read this. - Uh? Shit... Why do you say shit? We had a treasure, and we've sold it for silly money... All is not lost. That's what you say! She's now set sail to god knows where! God... and maybe me as well, in a few hours time... We must retake this virgin, before she really gets taken... Or after? I'm not fussed... But first, we have to make a quick call. To whom? Hello? I would like to talk to Mr. Goldstone. It's regarding Jenny. Hello. This is goldstone. We have your daughter, alive. Are you ready to talk money? Yes. Of course. I'll gladly pay your ransom, just keep her safe, she's only a child... - Don't hurt her. - We treated her right, so far... - Thank you. - We want five million dollars. That's fine by me. Tell me how I can meet you... I beg you, as soon as possible. I'll call you in a few days... Just don't do anything stupid! Not a word to the police... Or we will kill your daughter... This is the real deal, Tom. - There's no time to waste. - 4ndeed. Ah... shut up... Silence! Yes... That's it, that's it... Moan, moan... Hey... a great place to be, right? Excellent, my dear Robert. Thanks to flora, it's always fun in here, you know... - Is that to your liking, Rob darling? - Unbelievably so. I've got a surprise for you. Tell me quickly! A real 16 year old Pearl... - And a virgin to boot! - A 10 year old who hasn't fucked much, eh? No, that's not the case! You reckon? - She's a real one, my dear! - I deserve no less, right? - Your charm deserves only the best. - And my wallet as well... Robert, you're a witness... Rob is becoming vulgar. - Did I mention money? - Ah, true. Excuse me, flora. Returning to money matters, I'd prefer a gift, if you're satisfied. We should work together. My business would be better. - Flatterer! - Of course! You're so diplomatic. So, at midnight? Okay. Oh, this is unbelievable... Oh, that's nice... Oh, just unbelievable... Here she is... Not bad... Not bad at all... There... Oh, not bad at all! Pretty... I like her. Great. Ah... she's wonderful, huh? Ah... what a body... Oh... her skin... Soft as a peach... Oh, god! - Now the curtains are raised... - Let it go... - Take it easy... - Wonderful! Is she new? That was money well spent. There, come on... Let him do it. Come on! - There... - Just like that... That's good... Let him do it, don't move... - There, come, my darling. - Come on, come on! You got what you paid for! Like so, now, don't move! Come on... relax, relax! Oh, come on, good... Yes... There... Come on, come on, come on... - Softly... - There... - That's good, right? - Good, my dear, that's good... - Admit it, that's good... - Behave, behave... - Yes... - Behave... that's it... Oh... I'm done... - No, you're not... - I am! - Come on... - That was wonderful. It's not over yet. You'll see... There... Just hold still there... Behave... Still, now... That's it. - Where to? - To the best hotel in the city. Follow that taxi! Ah... my sex is burning! Who wants to finish me off? No... Oh... please, help me... Oh, yes... oh! Oh, please... Oh... it's burning me... oh! Yes... Oh, yes, I feel it... Oh, yes... yes... Oh! I'm burning! Oh, please... Quite a performance last night... Oh, I'm dead... How beautiful that little slut is. Her cunt is like a passion fruit... And her ass! She made me come five times... Come in. Well, what is it? One of the new girls... Sylvia... She's going crazy... - More and more. - Take her, then. You can calm her down. Thank you, madam. Then aftennards, put her back in the cell. I'd like to see that... I have an idea. Bring her here, you can use my bed for your antics... - But, madam... - Go and get her. Do as I say. Oh, no! Leave me alone! - Oh, yes... - Oh, no! No! Oh, no! Oh, yes... Oh, yes! That's good! More! Oh, yes! Oh, it's good! Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, yes... Come on, calm down... Crazy bitch! Beg for it! You want it, eh? Yes, yes... Oh, yes! It feels good, eh? She's biting me! - Your passes, please? - We forgot them. Then go find them. No, it's fine! Just tell madam flora we're here on behalf of captain Marcos. I'm afraid I can't do that right now. - Why is that? - Well... she's busy. But if you'd like a drink... With pleasure... Come... No thanks, as nice as you are... What are you drinking? Whiskey. - You, whiskey? - Yes. Okay, I'll bring you some. Yes? Look at that girl... You should try to make her talk... |'|| try. Good evening. Do you know a girl named Jenny? Don't know, not that I can remember... - The virgin? - That's right. She came here with us... Good. Where is she? Excuse me, sir... Madam flora has finished and is ready to receive you... Do you want something? In a place like this? Nothing. You don't like the show, sir? No, and less still the clientele... Oh, yes... You want it, eh? Oh, yes... You want it, eh? Oh, yes... Oh, my head... I'm giving you a young man! Have fun with him... Do whatever you want with him. A present for you, kids! Easy does it... eh? Oh, yes, more... Have fun and make the most of it... Hey, girls! Yes, come... Beautiful... More... You naughty girl... You're gonna fuck me... So good... Come on! Throw her into the mix! Come on! Another one? We must satisfy their curiosity... Go on, bind her good and tight... When they're worn out, which won't be long, you know what to do, eh? - Got it? - Okay. Hello? I got a call straight from the director of the federal police. That couple you knocked about then left on the roadside, they've gone and filed a complaint against you. I'm sorry... but you gotta admit, it's the first time that... Hold it! This is completely unacceptable! I will not tolerate this kind of thing. - But I swear... - Don't swear, flora! It's pointless. I repeat, I don't want to see this kind of stupidity from you again. Anyway, we I! Talk more tomorrow, in person. - You want to come here? - I'll come down tomorrow. We must sort things out, once and for all. Such errors are unforgivable, my dear flora... - I'm counting on you! - Don't worry. - Do you have any new recruits? - A recent arrival. I 'd like to have a look. Discreetly? - As always. - I'll see you tomorrow, dear. See you... Goodbye. Hurry up! Straight to flora's... You must be off your head! You can't act like this with strangers! You never know... I have friends but I can't go too far... I've decided to end the matter, right here! As you wish... It's best you get out of town, after such careless behavior... It's not like you, flora... Soon, we'll find a new home in California. It's a land full of promise... I just bought an island there. So, you'll take me there? If you promise to behave yourself! You know, I've made a lot of money for you, this time... 20 million... Even after I get my 25%... I always said you were a remarkable business woman. Is that all I am? A remarkable business woman? Leave me alone! I have a terrible problem... My daughter. She's been kidnapped. I've had no news for almost a month... Can't stop you getting excited though... Jawohl! Bastard! Ah... oh, yes... I've a very pretty girl for you, just you wait... She'll make you come with her girly little mouth... Yes... Da... Daddy? - My god! - Daddy? Dress me... How did she end up here? Some couple sold her to us. We didn't ask any questions... I hope you wouldn't have hired my own daughter... Where can I find these people? At the bottom of the sea... They were becoming troublesome and nosey. You had no choice. When I'm out of here, wipe out all traces... It's terrible, my child. I hope that time can heal these wounds... That you can forgive me and think this was all a nightmare. Ultimately, it was my fault. Ambition and the lure of profit, the fun of playing with everything... Without restraint, without limits... It had to all come crashing down on me. It was inevitable. Can you forgive me? Can you forget? Yes. But I'll never forget... Who are you? Agent a! Pereira. - I think we need to talk. - No way. What do you want from me? My duty is to hand you over to the proper authorities. - What authorities? - Our own country's authorities. But... where are you taking me? Simple. To the airport. Then on to the United States. That would be best. I don't trust the local authorities. Just a suspicion. Things will be quicker in america. You think the justice system over there isn't just as rotten? Maybe, but even so, the chances are you'll be punished properly. You no longer live there, you don't have any friends there, and nobody there has benefited from your generosity. The end
