Well he'll probably want to call in on your class Don't worry, l'll deal with him You don't deal with inspectors from the local authority, Mr. Brown You cossett them, flatter them and agree with everything they say Yes, l'll do that as well - l expect he'll want to see your register - My register? - You do have a register? - Oh, that register!

There's an inspector from the local Education Authority coming round - The big boss - Yes l suppose you could say that But from my experience they're usually interfering old fogies - You don't like them? - Not particularly Frankly, they're quite useless and they are as outdated as their teaching methods l mean, what is the point of learning past participles Cognate objects or subordinate clauses? Far more useful to try to teach foreign students how to order a meal or find accommodations - You appear to have some unique ideas - l suppose l have - You know you speak English fairly well - Thank you What is your name? - Roger Kenyon - Roger Kenyon Ah Miss Courtney! l'm just completing the register and getting the details of our new student Before that inspector chappie pokes his nose in Oh, no! - Mr. Brown - l shan't be a moment Miss Courtney - What is yourjob? - lnspector What local transport?

You know Miss Courtney, your Mr. Brown is a remarkable man - l am? - He is? Yes!

Ah, at last! A pity you didn't arrive half an hour earlier Why? You might've saved me a great deal of embarrassment With a certain African gentleman Yes, he was the inspector but l mistook him for you - You thought a gentleman was me? - Yes The silly fool pretended to be a student, sit in the back to catch me out But l saw through him l gather you think he was a bit stupid Definitely, thick as a brush - Was his name Mr. Kenyon? - Yes - Do you know him? - l should do l've come to collect him! l'm his wife!
