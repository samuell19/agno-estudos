Step back a bit, please. It was planned. How much manpower and time could have been wasted... only to find out that this cigarette is unrelated to the case? - I'm sorry. - No need to apologize. Either swallow it or put it away. Today, on Sha Tin Road Lion Rock Tunnel... The largest robbery in Hong Kong history occurred. A Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club cash van was robbed. According to preliminary reports, approximately 33 million dollars was stolen. Although the criminals used poison gas, no one was injured. Due to the criminals' swift actions and meticulous planning, it is believed that the robbers may be part of an organized criminal group. Doesn't your company have a rule against changing routes? Why did you change route? A foreign police officer told me to go down that road. Can you recognize him? All Europeans look the same. Who is this person? Bobby Vance. And this one? Gary Moore. Aren't they Europeans? Then can you tell them apart? He might not know the governor. But a true Hong Kong citizen knows all the jockeys. You'll be assigned to guard the Governor's residence sooner or later, so you can get to know what he looks like. What are you doing? I work for an international insurance company. Here's my identification. Thank you. Check in please. I'm warning you, hand over the culprit within three days, or I'll shut down all your construction sites. Don't blame me for not giving you face. Brother Long. Have a seat. Brother Long, phone call. What brings you here, Brother Long? Your boss asked me to hand someone over, how could I not deliver them personally? Tell the police officer how you robbed the cash van. Royal Hong Kong Police Force. Take away delivery. Okay, put it over there Haven't had dinner yet? Why is one person watching three TVs? Everyone has two pairs of eyes The brain also has front, back, left, and right Detective movie? No, a romantic art film Want to steal plot points to write a novel? See how thieves steal plot points to commit robberies You're such a bookworm... We handle more than ten cases a day But you, not even one case in ten years. If we watched TV all day the thieves would all escape. Fish burger or hamburger? I don't want anything Here Here, have some Be careful, don't overfeed my fish Even fish burgers can be overfed It's fine if you don't eat, but the fish will starve. Look, the whole fish tank is empty, not even a sand bed. Raising a dragon doesn't require sand I hate fish the most, so annoying. My subordinates said you went to the crime scene, any clues? You want clues, huh? See for yourself, over there. Where did this matchbox come from? From the match factory Did you find it at the crime scene? How did we miss it? Not at the scene, but on the road above. There was a car crash there That place is prone to accidents Car accident in front, oil drum rolled down behind. God damn it! London You found it at the accident scene Here, watch the video The protagonist of this movie is a wealthy adrenaline junkie. He recruits people from all over the world to commit crimes. After, they go their separate ways. There's no way to catch up with them Check points at the airport yet? Do you think I'm clueless? Even first-class passengers are checked? Notify immigration and customs immediately All passengers need to be checked, no matter who they are or what class they're in. Notify the Civil Aviation Department to collect the passenger list Who are you talking about? I want to speak to San Kai! No such person, wrong number. Switzerland Bank of Switzerland. Henry. Hong Kong This person is a bit suspicious Why would a person with billions commit a robbery? Are rich people incapable of being thieves? Information print out please. Okay Switzerland Great! You are a super skier. Are you Japanese? I'm Chinese I didn't know Chinese people could ski so well Could we have a drink? No thanks... unless you can beat me. Don't go! Damn it! What bad luck. France Over here Please have a seat Excuse me, could you please deliver this to the lady for me? A bottle of Chateau Petrus '69 Alright, sir Chateau Petrus I didn't order this wine. It was the gentleman sitting over there who asked me to deliver it Shall I pour you a glass? Do you want this wine? I hope you enjoy this bottle of wine. The lift is out of order. Oh! I see, thank you. I am When I got back you were already gone Wasn't the wine I sent good enough? If Chateau Petrus isn't good enough, no wine would ever be good enough. I saw you hand-gliding this morning. And I saw you again tonight. Isn't that coincidental? If I say it is, would you believe me? Do you believe it? There are only 3 bottles of Chateau Petrus in Paris. I would not be by chance that you got hold of one Believe it or not, it's up to you. Maybe we'll meet again. Oh, by the way... Your complexion tonight looks a little sickly. Goodbye. Hong Kong Are you crazy? Waking me up so early. I'm sorry. I forgot that civil servants work 9 to 5 Why are you calling so early? I found a phone number in that woman's notebook. It matches the one on the match box. The phone number on the matchbox is the same. Send someone to investigate. Paris. Good morning. How did you know I live here? If I want to know about someone, I have my ways. You were working so late last night, you can't have had breakfast. Why don't we eat together? Sure, let's go. Do you like playing games? It depends on how it's played. Great. Strange, is it broken? It was working fine last night. One thing good about this phone... it remembers the number you last dialed, so you won't forget who you called. Really? Sorry, I need to make a call. Why is there a missing page? Gone with the wind. Sorry, I'll be back in a moment. Get in the car. Hurry up, come on. What are you up to? Get in the car first. Hurry up, get in the car. Sir, your coffee. You haven't paid for your coffee yet. What happened? A guided tour of Paris! Stop. He took my car away. Stop! Stop, obey the order. They are going by the river. I read you, car No. 1. Stop, obey the order. In the direction of Pont de Neuilly. Attention all units. We just passed the military academy. Stop! Turn around, don't move! Give me your I.D. Where is it? Where's the girl? Come on, talk. Where's the girl? For me? London, Chinatown. Lao Chen, that woman next door called. Someone was rummaging through your house. Ah Wing, fill in for me. What are you doing here? Who are you? Why are you rummaging in my things? How did you get into my house? You're trespassing, I'll call the police. Royal Hong Kong Police Force You are prime suspect in the Royal Jockey Club robbery I don't necessarily need you to talk, but what you say will become evidence in court. Are you mistaken? Don't talk nonsense. When did I rob the Jockey Club? Still not admitting it? This is your passport. On June 15th, what did you go to Hong Kong for? Going to Hong Kong is a crime? You work as a cook in Chinatown. You haven't been back to Hong Kong in twenty years. You went back for two days then left. What's your real purpose there? For the robbery? Robbery? Brother, I didn't. Do what? This gun was found at the scene of the robbery. It has your fingerprints on it. You can't deny it. Brother, you're framing me. Brother, I really didn't rob anyone. Why are you doing this to me? It really has nothing to do with me. I was only a driver there. Driver? And there was an accident. Someone gave you money to crash the car. Who was it? Quickly, tell me who it was. Otherwise, you're done for. I don't know who she is. I only saw her once. Can you recognize her? France. You're a pretty good rider. Passable. Lately, we've been together every day. You know everything about my affairs. Just one thing missing. What? Evidence. Then you have two more days. I'll return to Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. Do you think you can escape? It doesn't matter where you go. Is that so? "The net of heaven is wide, but it lets nothing through" So you must catch me? Catching you is the police's job. Mine is to recover the money. Who would've thought that money could create so much joy? Do you think being chased is fun? I think the real fun is when no one can catch you. How about we have a competition? If you win, I'll give you evidence. Stay away! Danger! Where's your sportsmanship? Sore loser? I know you like to play. But I don't want to play with you. You'll end up dead sooner or later. Have you eaten? Care to join me? When did you sneak in? We civil servants are very efficient. I've got that chap you want me to check on. Brother, I didn't do it. What the hell? How can you treat people like this? Person? He's a criminal. Brother, it's none of my business. I don't know anything. Shut up. Want me to beat you again? Torture is against the law. A fuss over nothing. Come on, you were a cop before. Kindness to criminals is cruel to yourself. I caught the pawn, it's your turn to get the queen. Arrange a meeting with her, he'll ID her for us. What now? Fell for the beauty trap, can't bear to arrest her. Damn it! Sorry, my mistake, I was waiting for you upstairs. Waiting upstairs is better, there's a TV to watch. You've got it wrong, it's not her. What did you get wrong? Let's go over there. You only have one day left, where do you want to take me? Don't hit. Stop it. What did she give you in return? Why don't you identify her? - It's not her, really, it's not her. - Why? Tell me. The woman I saw, it's not her. You gonna kill him? A person like him won't speak unless beaten. Stop! Go away. Stop! Go away! None of your business. Stop, or else. Great, excellent performance. Performance? You think everyone is as heartless as you? Look, this is because of you. He was beaten because of you. Is it her? Did she instruct you to say that? It's her. Brother, it's not her. Say it, it's her. Say it again and I'll sue you for defamation. Look how she's repaying you for your loyalty Release him. Release me. Stop holding me. Stop the beating. Let go, or you'll be in trouble. None of your business. Stop. I'm from Royal Hong Kong Police Force. Let go, I'm a senior officer. I'm more senior than all of you. You have no authority to arrest me. Did you hear me? What are you doing? This is France, Paris. It's not Hong Kong. You don't have the authority to arrest anyone here. I don't understand what you're saying. I don't understand! I want to see the British consul. You're in the circle, I'm in the circle. Turning away from the unfamiliar road. Passing by sideways. How many times right, how many times wrong. Neither you nor I have thought about it. It came by chance. Even if we want to leave, we can't. Like stars lingering in the sky. Falling in the silent wind. Hard to see through the heart, yet feeling harmonious. Unknown, but it's in my heart. Love like smoke, hoping to know why. Passing through illusions, falling into confusion. If we have loved deeply, what will happen in the end? Is everything wrong? One side has you. One side has me. Seems like we should be together. But we missed each other. Gentle breeze, light rain, passing by the window. Teaching you to silently think of me. One side has you. One side has me. Seems like we should be together, but we missed each other. Gentle breeze, light rain, passing by the window. Teaching you to silently think of me. Came by chance, even if we want to leave, we can't. Is everything wrong? Well, still working on it? We don't have any evidence. Forget it, the company has paid up already anyway. No. She has to give the money back. Listen up, we must catch that woman. She must not escape. Follow her until she's annoyed, until she's bored... until we catch her. Sorry, you don't have an appointment. Miss Yeung won't be able to see you. Mr. Lam, Miss Yeung invites you in. Long time no see, please sit. I have something I want to talk to you about. I hope it's not business. I want to broaden your horizons. Look, the Hong Kong Police are so diligent. Besides catching thieves, they clean windows for the citizens. I don't need to hire bodyguards, nowadays there are police everywhere. What's the matter? Fine. I thought you had something to say. If we're having a competition to see who can stay silent, then I surrender. Would you give up? Those cops are just doing their jobs. Why make things difficult for them? They gave me a hard time first. But you did break the law. It's their duty to keep a watch on you. Be careful with your words. If you were surrounded by a bunch of flies all day. What would you do? Maybe your mouth is greasy after eating. If you clean yourself, they'll stop bothering you. Come here. Do you know why I called you here? I want to share something with you. How exciting! I'm preparing for another robbery. You can't stop me. Because the plan is already in motion. Where? Up ahead. See the woman in black? She's wearing a necklace worth one million dollars. I've put a bomb underneath her seat. It'll go off in ten minutes. I've arranged someone nearby. When the bomb explodes, they will take advantage of the chaos to steal the necklace. You don't believe me? All that for a mere million? A million dollars can be very exciting. It's crazy to believe in her. Yes, but she's crazy. 3 minutes gone. Another 15 seconds. Another 20 seconds. What shall we do? Crazy. Yes, she is really crazy. Another 10 seconds. Twenty seconds. Everything is going according to plan. Watch out for anyone using a wireless phone. A man across from me just hung up. Excuse me for a moment. A foreign lady just greeted her. One of the gang maybe. What shall we do now? If it explodes, it'll be a disaster. San Kau, take the bomb away, on the double Bomb? Where? Check if there's anything under the chair. In the briefcase. I've got a stomach-ache, I'm leaving. San Kau, stay there... Go get the bomb, quick. Me? Quickly. Yes. Captain. San Chu. Yes, sir. Go get the briefcase within 3 minutes. Where's the briefcase? Not just a briefcase, there is a bomb. San Kai, have you got the briefcase? Captain, what's the matter? What? You're still here? I've told San Chu to go... Captain. You're all idiots. Call the police immediately. Aren't we the police? Call the station. Station? Ask HQ to send reinforcements. Yes. Miss Yeung, the champagne you requested. Leave it here, thank you. What is it? Police, we suspect there's a bomb here. What? A bomb? Get rid of it in one minute, go. Yes, sir. Excuse me. Excuse me. What is this? This is my briefcase. What are you doing? There's a bomb! Everybody down. Don't let them run. Don't move. What are you doing? Quickly throw the bomb into the toilet. Over there. What's happening here? She made a false bomb threat. Really? Who said so? You said there was a bomb. I was joking with my friend here. How did you hear it? Did you all hear it? You were eavesdropping, that's invasion of privacy. Even the police have to obey the law. You're colluding with this woman, aren't you? Some friend! Sorry about yesterday. It's nothing. You said you had something to talk to me about. What is it? I hope you could give the money back. You're so rich already. I know you're just seeking excitement. Are you done playing now? Why leave a trail? So you think I did something wrong. Everyone thinks he or she is right. But you know you're wrong, and still think you're right. Is that so? Sometimes I feel very unhappy. So I do things that make me happy. Why, when you have so much money? I feel like they're happier than me. You sang it wrong. Let's play together, okay? What is it? Do you know him? We don't know him. What difference does it make? Alright, ask them to join us. Come join us. Welcome, welcome. What do you do? What's your name? I'm Xie Gen. I haven't been this happy in a long time. Not even over breaking the Hong Kong record for robbery? Any decision on what we've been talking about? What thing? I hope you'll return the money. Legally, we have no proof against you but you know what you've done. Until this matter is resolved, the police will haunt you. Hand over the money. We know she's the mastermind and is receiving stolen goods. So what? There's no proof. Even if you keep pestering her, what? I just want to make her uncomfortable. When she slips up, I'll catch her. You think she will? The more you bother her, the more she finds it exciting. Can your men handle her? Remember the bomb hoax? You looked like a fool. She agreed to return the money. Can you treat it as an unsolved case? If we get the money back, your insurance company will be fine, but what should I do? I'll give you my reward money. That's bribing a public official. No way. Then forget it, my company has paid. It's your game now. How's she going to give it back? She'll put the money somewhere. And let you know. And the police should announce it in the TV News. Okay. - Why so late? - I haven't slept yet. Just feeding the fish. I thought you hate fish. People can change. Come on, eat the food. The news didn't mention the money. Why? She didn't pay, so it wasn't announced. Do you think rich people dislike having too much money? You're too naive to believe her. Trying to trick me, but there's no way. I've already handed over the money. Believe it or not, it's up to you. He's your friend. Tell him not to bother me anymore. Is he tailing you still? Since he wants to catch me... I'll give him another chance. I'll do it again. After playing me last time, you want to come again? Impossible. You don't think she'll do it again. Not an exact repeat at least. The more risky it is, the more she wants to do it. Well I've warned you. Don't say I'm not a good friend later. I'm no rookie cop, nobody plays me. Once I catch her, you'll see how capable I am. She just wants you to give back the money. Hand it over and everything will be fine. If you say I took that money again... we won't be friends. I can accuse you of conspiracy and have you arrested too. Now, is it the police catching the thief, or the thief catching the police? If you don't believe me, report me to the ICAC. See how much property I have. Don't trust that woman, she's playing you. Will you really rob again? Maybe. Will you catch me? Even if I don't catch you, that fat guy will. What about you? Me? I will rob again. You can tell your friend to catch me. Captain, your phone. That woman really robbed again. Really? Where? Same as last time. Can you drive? I didn't mean to. What happened? Impossible. The security guard won't change the route again. Of course, she has other ways. Where will she pick the loot? You can still stop her now. Bet on this horse, it's a sure win. I asked where that woman receives the stolen goods. What's going on? Just let her rob. Where exactly? The door won't open. What's going on? What's going on? Don't you want to catch her? I'll take you there. Okay, I'm coming right away. That woman robbed again. What are you doing? Notify the other units. Let her go. If she can't rob, we have no evidence to arrest her. What about the money? The money belongs to the Jockey Club. It's none of your business. Let's go. Help! Someone is robbing, robbery! Quick! Help! Robbery! Give it to me. Listen, everyone, listen. Everyone, pay attention to the situation on the sea. That woman could appear at any time. Will she really come? Yes. Here she comes. She's here. Everyone, get ready. Why isn't it landing? Where's that woman? Stop talking, hurry and chase after her. Hello, I'm Brown. There's been another robbery in Sha Tin. If you want to catch someone, follow that helicopter. What helicopter? Who are you? Attention all units. If anyone sees a helicopter, report it to us immediately. We saw a helicopter heading for Kowloon. The helicopter is now flying northwest. Anyone seeing it? Contact Headquarters! The helicopter is now over Kowloon City. Heading towards Wong Tai Sin. We just received a report. The helicopter is now over Ngau Tau Kok. It has reached Tseng Lan Shue. Attention, Sai Kung unit. The helicopter has reached your area. The helicopter is here. Chase it! The helicopter has landed. Isn't that the captain's house? Yes, it is. Captain. Captain, the helicopter landed in your backyard. What should we do? Hurry and chase after it. Get in the car quickly. Get in. Where are you going? The helicopter flew off, we're going to chase after it. No, we need to go inside. What? I received a tip that the suspect is receiving stolen goods inside. Come with me. Yes. Take a careful look. You two, go and take a look. Search thoroughly. Go over there and look. This is my stuff, be careful. Sorry, Captain. We didn't find anything. Yeah, we couldn't find anything. Mothing here. Nothing upstairs either. Nothing, right? Ah Ching, I'm really sorry. My tip was wrong, I might have made a mistake. Let's go back to the station. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, Captain. A cop is too smart to put the loot in a bank Of course. Look, there's something underneath. It was hidden in the fish tank. Catch him! You've always hated keeping fish. You don't need so much sand to raise a dragon and make it spit pearls. So much money. Greece, Mykonos Island.
