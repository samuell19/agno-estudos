Andrew! San Francisco 2014 Andrew! Andrew! Andrew! Thousands gathered in the Bay Area last night to honor the victims of the 2014 attacks. Part of a wave of memorials and protests demanding that the secretive monster-hunting coalition known as Monarch be held accountable. The recent spike in mass die-offs in the world's oceans could be caused by efforts to locate and track Godzilla who hasn't been seen in over five years. Top brass in the mysterious Monarch organization will face another intense grilling as the government continues to push for extermination of the Titans. And rumors persist that Monarch may be hiding even more creatures discovered since the attacks of 2014. A historic tragedy that changed the world as we know it forever. The day the world discovered that monsters are real. ♪ Cease to resist, giving my goodbye ♪ ♪ Drive my car into the ocean ♪ ♪ You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away ♪ ♪ On a wave of mutilation ♪ ♪ A wave of mutilation ♪ ♪ Wave of mutilation ♪ ♪ Wave ♪ Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! - Uh... - Maddie? Good morning! - Morning, Mom! - Oh, God. I made us breakfast. It's, uh... eggs, toast and what was once... bacon. And which do you recommend? The toasted eggs. Thank you. Coffee? What were you working on? Um, I was looking at recipes. For toast? Dad's been emailing me. But he looks good... healthy. - Have you responded? - Not yet. Madison, I just don't want to see you get hurt. I know. Especially with everything that's going on right now... Mom, I know. Listen, I know things haven't been easy for you. But we're gonna get through this... together. You sure he's gonna be okay? He is in the safest place that he could be right now. Wanna hear some good news? I finished it. Really? You think it's gonna work? It's gonna work. It's gonna be okay. Dr. Russell, we need you in containment. I'm on my way. Monarch Outpost 61 Yunnan Rainforest, China. - What the hell happened? - No idea. She was sleeping like a baby until an hour ago and then boom! Radiation levels went through the roof. Almost like something triggered it. Thanks, Tim. You know, I can take it from here. Why don't you get some rest? No way. Sleep or no sleep, I'm not missing this. Containment team, move into primary position. Sedatives? No effect. This thing wants to be born. Emergency protocols in effect. Two to address the primary team. The time has come. Meet Titanus mosura. Or as we like to call her... Mothra. Incredible. Activate containment grid. What's happening? Something's really wrong here. Containment systems are failing. Perimeter alarms are going off, the whole network's going insane. What do you mean? How is that possible? Emma, I think someone else is doing this. Containment team, stand down. I repeat, stand down. You are scaring her. No! Dr. Russell, I'm sorry, but you know the protocols. We have to terminate. I'll handle this. Mom, no! Madison, stay here. It's gonna work. Stand clear. It's okay. Mom! Mom! Maddie. Wait! Get back in here! Maddie, go back! Look out! Mom... Son of a bitch. It worked. What we are witnessing here, senators, is the return of an ancient and forgotten super species. Monarch Senate Hearings - Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong. We believe that these Titans and others like them provide an essential balance to our world. And while some may pose a threat, Monarch is uniquely prepared to determine which of these Titans are here to threaten us and which of these Titans are here to protect us. Thank you for the 5th grade History lesson, Mr. Coleman. But we still haven't heard one good reason why Monarch shouldn't fall under military jurisdiction or why these creatures shouldn't be exterminated. Monarch was tasked with finding and destroying these radioactive monsters. But you either can't or won't tell us how many there are or why they're showing up. So, maybe it's time for the military to put them down. Killing them would be a mistake. They returned because of us. It was our atomic testing that awoke Godzilla. Other creatures like the MUTOs from strip mining and seismic surveys. But these are not monsters. They are animals rising to reclaim a world that was once theirs. It almost sounds like you're protecting them, Dr. Serizawa. As if you admire them. I admire all forms of life. Senators, if we hope to survive, we must find ways to coexist with Titans. With Godzilla. A sort of symbiotic relationship, if you will. Like The Lion and the Mouse. Or The Scorpion and the Frog. So you'd want to make Godzilla our pet? No. We would be his. Uh, no. No, actually. That's not what Dr. Serizawa meant. No one is implying that... - we would be Godzilla's - Excuse me, we have to go. or anyone's pet. Dr. Serizawa, Dr. Graham, this hearing is not adjourned. Dr. Serizawa! I hope you understand the consequences of walking out that door. Uh, you know what, senators, while I confer with my colleagues here, I'm gonna set you up with a very brief and pretty fun documentary on Titan reproduction. I think this is the one where the genitals are blurred out. But if not, uh, you can leave a comment with my assistant. Colorado The feed cuts out there. The survivors haven't been able to give us much more than what the footage allows. Only that Emma and Madison were the only ones taken. I'm sorry, Mark. I should've been there for 'em. - Who are they? - We don't know yet. We believe... they were after this. - You didn't. - It's the Orca. Uh, that's why we think they need Emma. She believed that if we could somehow replicate the biosonar the Titans use to communicate... I know what the hell it is. I helped build the prototype. Who is he? Uh, Sam Coleman, I'm the head of Technology. I joined Monarch, uh, shortly after you left. I'm a big fan of your wife...'s work and you... that's not even... so weird. I'm sorry. Emma and I destroyed the prototype. And then Emma decided to rebuild it. After San Francisco, she went home to Boston, spent years developing it. - She thought it could help. - Help what? Play God? No. Help prevent another attack. Orca was a grad school science project. It was meant to t-to keep whales away from the shoreline. Not so you could talk to your little creatures out there. Listen to me. They'll think it's one of them. You use the wrong frequency on one of 'em... and you're gonna be responsible for a thousand San Franciscos. Which is why we need to get it back. Emma always said, no one knew the Orca better than you. It shouldn't even exist. That may be, Mark, but it's fallen into the wrong hands. And right now, the Orca is the only thing keeping Emma and Madison alive. Mark, we know you're hurting. But if we find the Orca, we'll find your family. I promise. When was the last time you spoke to Emma? About three years ago. After San Francisco, we... we went back home to Boston. Tried to put the pieces back together. Emma dealt with it by doubling down on saving the world. I started drinking. I can't tell you how much I hated myself for letting Maddie see me that way. Uh, you mind if we cut in here? It's just, you're gonna... wanna see this. Emma combined the bioacoustics of different Titans to create the Orca's signal. A sort of baseline frequency that all the creatures respond to. Attracting them, repelling them, even at times, calming them down. It's pretty remarkable, actually. The problem is, we don't know which Titans she combined. But if you can identify those frequencies, we'll be able to track the Orca and find Emma and Madison. Jesus. How many of these things are there? 17... And counting, after Godzilla. 17? Most of them were discovered in deep hibernation. While others we contained at top secret sites around the globe. Cambodia, Mexico, Skull Island. We even found one in Wyoming. They're everywhere. Why don't you kill 'em? The government wants to. But Emma and I believe some are benevolent. Don't kid yourself. Ah, hey, look at that. We're here. Castle Bravo, this is Raptor One on direct approach. Castle Bravo Monarch Outpost 54, Bermuda Raptor One, you are cleared for assisted descent to Pad 4. Sensors set for three meters. Beginning subsurface descent. This is new. Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo. Our new flagship facility. Built to track and study Godzilla on his own turf. I thought he was missing? Well, only if you don't know where to look. As you know, at approximately 0700 hours, our containment site in China's Yunnan Rainforest was raided. A specimen, code-named Mothra, escaped. Only to cocoon itself later under a nearby waterfall. Our Dr. Emma Russell and her daughter Madison were taken hostage. This is the man responsible. Alan Jonah. A former British Army colonel turned eco-terrorist. Obsessed with restoring the natural order. And to fund his operations, he began trafficking in a new and dangerous market: Titan DNA. What the hell's someone gonna do with a giant worm? You kiddin', Martinez? What can't you do with it? Pharmaceuticals, bioweapons, food. Hell, there isn't a country or a company on the planet that doesn't wanna get its hands on one of these suckers. And remember, this is just a larva. That's a baby. After it cocoons, somethin' else is gonna crawl out. Somethin' bigger. - Meaner. - We don't know that, Rick. Oh, yeah? Just... wait for it, Chen. Our Intel indicates that Jonah wants to capture this specimen. Alive. Which means that he and his mercs won't be far behind. At 0500, we'll ship out to launch a joint operation... I wouldn't bother. Excuse me? Sounds like a duck hunt to me. Uh, Mark, why don't we let Colonel Foster... A decoy, a diversion. Look, they've already got Emma and the Orca. Why would they want just this one, when they've got the keys to your entire magic kingdom of horrors back here? I think that they want you to go after this Mothra so they can go after a real prize. Something bigger. Right. Mark, this is not the first specimen they've captured. They know what they are doing. That's not just a specimen. I've got an ex-wife and a daughter out there, in case you forgot. Well, no one has forgotten that, Mark. But, uh, to remind you, you were brought on here to track the Orca. And to advise us... I advise you to kill these things. All of 'em! Especially him. You wanna make sure these things don't fall into the wrong hands? You kill them, and the Orca is useless. Emma wouldn't have wanted that. Even to save her life. It wouldn't be the first time Emma put all of this before herself or her family, would it? Dude hates Titans. Yeah, well, you would too, if you were him. Outpost 32, this is Raptor Five on approach with reinforcements and supplies. Requesting permission to land. Serizawa has all sites on high alert, so transmitting emergency codes now. Copy that, Raptor Five. Codes are good. Nice to have you back. Antarctica Monarch Outpost 32 Go. I'm scared. I know. Me too. Okay. Let's go. Eyes straight ahead. Deep breaths. Just like we talked about. Mother of God. She had nothing to do with this. Monster Zero. Any survivors? No. They tried to launch an emergency beacon, but we cut them off in time. They'll figure it out. Fire all the drills. Do you have everything you need? Good! Let's get started. We have a grizzly situation up here in the attic. Come on, Andrew. Andrew. Stop. Look. An intruder! Get her! - Get her! - No! No, don't get me! Andrew, Madison, get her! Bear kisses! Aaah! All personnel, report to battle stations. Code: Red. All personnel, report to battle stations. Code: Red. This is not a drill. All personnel, report to battle stations. Code: Red. What's happening? Something's wrong. He's never been this close before. - Who's "he"? - Who do you think? He's taking out our observation drones. - Trajectory? - Straight at us. 1,200 meters and closing. G-Team! Barnes, Martinez, Hendrix, I want you on those crows, now! You heard boss lady! Let's move! Dr. Stanton, do you have his bioacoustics? Acoustics, comin' up. Okay, he's closing. We're at 800 meters. His movements are erratic. Heart and breathing elevated. He's definitely not happy about something. How are they getting him? Godzilla's bioacoustics. It allows us to track him. Even to get his vitals. Circling now. Closing in, 200 meters. Colonel. All teams in position. Weapons cocked. Ready to engage on my command. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Hold your fire. We don't know if he will attack. He will if you keep those guns on him. Now, I want him dead more than anybody but unless this is a fight that you know that you can win, for God's sake, stand down. Stand down. You can't be serious. I am. Stand down. Stand down. I say again, safety your weapons. Do not engage. Listen. His heart rate... it's slowing. Open the shields. Oh, yeah, sure, let's bring him in for a beer. You outta your goddamn mind? Let him know we're not a threat. Open the shields. Do it. Hey, what's with the light show? It's an intimidation display. Like a gorilla pounding its chest. Consider us very intimidated. I don't think it's for us. What are you doing, dude? Well, that was interesting. Could we maybe close the shield now? Show me his territorial routes. W-Why? Because I wanna start a boat tour. Just show me! Coming up. You care to tell us what you're looking for? When an animal leaves its hunting ground, it's usually because its threatened by something. Run a course projection. We've gotta go after him. He's looking for something out there. It could be the Orca. Dr. Stanton, what's your projection? All paths have him landing in the same place. Antarctica. Good, then. I mean, let's go! Let's go find him, let's... Wait. What's in Antarctica? Barnes. Contact the Argo. Yes, ma'am. USS Argo Monarch Command Ship The specimen at this site has been kept entirely off book. And since it's a more recent discovery, our data is limited. But it seems to be another apex predator. Emma called it "Monster Zero". It may have been a rival Alpha to Godzilla, battling for dominance over the other Titans. Dr. Chen? I've been scouring through thousands of years of myths and legends. But it's almost as if people were scared to even write about it. As if it was meant to be forgotten. So, I hate to crash the party, but I got some bad news. You could just say "news". It's always bad. We lost Godzilla. Dropped off the scan near Venezuela. Dropped off? I'm telling you, Dr. Brooks was right. It's a hollow Earth. That's how he moves around so fast, using these underwater tunnels like wormholes just like... zippin' around. Everyone look sharp! We're approaching the base. They're here. Keep 'em busy. Merge reaction force. Move out! If Jonah is looking to extract genetic samples, they'll be here. In the biolabs. Alright, two minutes! Check your equipment. Stand by the door. Come on, Ash, make it snappy. - Detonator ready. - Let's go. Come on, Maddie. Move, move! Remember, eyes wide. We got friendlies in here. Movin' to tunnel two. Ambush! Ambush! It's an ambush! We're taking heavy fi..! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! We got friendlies! Mark! Get down there and help Barnes. I'm goin' after 'em. Roger that. Hey, guys... I'm getting an EKG reading. Emma! Maddie! Barnes, this is Foster. I've got eyes on the target. Repeat: eyes on the target. Let 'em go! Ash! Dad! Mark. Emma, Madison, let's go! Dad. Let's go. Emma, Maddie, come on. - Daddy. - Madison, walk to me! Walk to me now. Come on, honey. Barnes, I've got two hostages, one target down. - Maddie, come on! - I do not have a shot. Repeat: I do not have a shot. Emma, what are you doing? Let's go! Come on! - Dad... - Maddie. Dad. Madison. What the hell? I'm sorry. Run. Maddie! Dad! Out of the way! Get the door! I got you! We gotta go! Dammit! Martinez! Foster! Let's go! What is Dad doing here? I don't know, honey. Let's go. We can't leave him. What are you waiting for? Wake it up. Come on! You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Fall back! Fall back! Get to the chopper! Come on! Come on, hurry! We'll do an emergency vertical take off at max RPMs. Number two's now spinning up. Oh, shit! This is Raptor One to Argos! Requesting immediate urgent extract! Again, I said, urgent extract! Griffin, get us the hell outta here! Madison! Madison, no! - What are you doing? Let go of it! - No! - Madison! - Maddie! Argo, this is Raptor One. We've been hit. We're down. Everybody hold on! Mark! Everybody clear out! Let's go! Mark! I'm stuck! Are you all right? I got it. I got it. Go, now! Anything on the satellites? Subs have Godzilla haulin' ass off Argentina. We lost Monster Zero on a tropical storm over Brazil. Scanning the entire southern hemisphere. So far, nothin'. Then scan the northern. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know what I saw, Sam. And I'm telling you, she pulled that trigger. All due respect, Colonel, you saw wrong. Okay? She wouldn't have done that. Christ, she recruited pretty much everyone in this room. Maybe Jonah forced her, right? Maybe he used Madison as leverage. No, no, it had to be someone else. Emma. It was Emma. Foster saw it right. It was her, no one forced her to. Are you sure? First, she releases Mothra, and now, Monster Zero. Anyone else sensing a pattern here? Yes, and not a good one. It's as if she's trying to start a mass awakening. Well, it's just too bad that no one tried to warn you that that was gonna happen. Hang on, guys. Why the hell would she want to release them? And why would she team up with Jonah, of all people, to do it? We'll ask her when we find her. So... let's keep looking. Godzilla appears to be following the same path as Emma's Osprey, heading north over South America to here. Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara, Mexico. We touchdown there in 10 minutes. What about the people? I'm sorry? The people. The people down there in that village that don't realize they're gonna be the 'special of the day'. We've sent G-Team to begin an evacuation. Dr. Serizawa, we have a call in the emergency channel from Isla de Mara. Answer it. I suppose I should go first. Where's Madison? - She's right here. - Dad, are you okay? Madison, you alright, hon? Dad... I'm sorry. - You don't need to be... - It's okay. I'm so... Dad? She's fine, Mark. Trust me. Trust is a little hard to come by, Dr. Russell. Especially after what you pulled. I know. And, uh, I can only imagine what you're all thinking. But if there were any other way to do this, I would. Do what, Emma? I'm saving the world. By releasing those things? That doesn't make sense. As impossible as it seems, it does. Hear me out, Mark. After we lost Andrew, I swore his death would not be in vain. That I would find an answer. A solution to why the Titans were rising. But as I dug deeper, I realized that they were here for a reason. And that despite all the years that we spent trying to stop them, we never dared to confront the truth. Which truth? Humans have been the dominant species for thousands of years, and look what's happened. Overpopulation. Pollution. War. The mass extinction we feared has already begun. And we are the cause. We are the infection. But like all living organisms, the Earth unleashed a fever to fight this infection. Its original and rightful rulers. The Titans. They are part of the Earth's natural defense system. A way to protect the planet, to maintain its balance. But if governments are allowed to contain them, destroy them, or use them for war, the human infection will only continue to spread. And within our lifetime, our planet will perish. And so will we. Unless we restore balance. And what's gonna be left if you do this? A dead, charred world overrun by monsters? No, Dr. Stanton, the exact opposite. Just like how a forest fire replenishes the soil, or how a volcano creates new land. We have seen signs that these creatures will do the same. San Francisco, Las Vegas, wherever the Titans go, life follows. Triggered by their radiation. They are the only thing that can reverse the destruction that we started. They are the only guarantee that life will carry on. But for that to happen, we must set them free. You are murdering the world. No. Because as difficult as this will be, I promise, humanity will not go extinct. Using the Orca, we will return to a natural order. A forgotten order where we coexisted in balance with the Titans. The first gods. This is a dangerous path. You are meddling with forces beyond our comprehension. Gambling with the lives of billions! And what are you gambling with, Serizawa? Monarch is broken. It's on the verge of being shut down by a government whose only objective is to eradicate the creatures. And if that happens, what will our chances be? You are outta your goddamn mind! First, you put our daughter's life in danger. Now, you get to decide the fate of the world. That's rich, Emma. I couldn't be more sane... and Madison couldn't be stronger. After we lost Andrew, I trained her to survive. And at least now, she will have a fighting chance. A fighting chance... Why don't you listen to yourself? It's not all math, Emma. Some things you can't control. And there are some things that you can't run from! This won't bring him back to us. I can only urge you all to take refuge. Over the last 60 years, Monarch has prepared bunkers around the world to save and restart civilization. This won't bring him back to us. I can only urge you all to take refuge. Over the last 60 years, Monarch has prepared bunkers around the world to save and restart civilization. I suggest you find them. That bitch. How long till this thing lands? Three minutes. - You might wanna rethink that. - Why? Somethin's not right. Check this out. Emma's not at Isla de Mara. I mean, the signal's too weak to be local, she's... bouncing it off our satellites. They must be holed up in one of our old bunkers. She could be anywhere. What is that? Oh, Jesus. She shut down the containment system. How much time do we have? Containment system bypassed. We're patched in. Ready to broadcast the Orca. Doctor? Mom, don't! I'm sorry, did a child just tell you what to do? Maybe Dad is right. Maybe this isn't the way. By all means, Dr. Russell, let's reconsider our entire plan. Especially after telling all your friends about it. Madison, we talked about this. No, you said you were gonna help people. that you would let them... We don't have time for this! Did you really think this was gonna be easy, painless? Is that what you told her? - Leave her out of this. - Why? You're the one who pulled her into it. Madison, tell me, what exactly did Mommy sell you on? Some grand utopia? Man and monster living together in blissful harmony? Sir, they're attempting to lock us out. It's now or never. Emma, you came to me. This is your plan. We both want to save the planet, but everything is going to die if we don't see it through. Please. At least let them get to safety. Ma'am, our window's closing. Mom. I'm sorry, Madison. This is bigger than just you and me. Isla de Mara, Mexico Monarch Outpost 56 You got a catchy name for this one? Local legends call it Rodan. The Fire Demon. That's comforting. Guys... Remember that tropical storm where we lost Monster Zero? It's changing direction and, uh, guess where it's headed now. That's not possible. No storm moves that fast. Unless it's not a storm. Oh, man. We need time to finish the evacuation. Then you better hurry 'cause it's closin' in fast. Serizawa. It's not a coincidence that Monster Zero thing is headed here. It's reacting to Big Bird's cries. That means it's coming for food or fight or... something more intimate. What do you suggest? All fighters, weapons free. Oh, I think we got his attention. Everyone strap in. All ships, follow our lead. It's gonna be okay! Hang on, kid! Argo to Gold Squadron, Let's lure this turkey away from the mainland straight to Monster Zero. ETA, two minutes. Gold Squadron, engage on our six. Copy. Start the clock. Bogey. 9 o'clock, hot. Raptor 223, get outta there. He's on your tail, get outta there! Cobra's Raptor is off the team. ETA to Monster Zero, 60 seconds! Raptor 27, bogey coming up on your six. I'm losing control here! I'm losing control...! We've lost the squadron. ETA to Monster Zero, 30 seconds! Ten seconds! Dive! Dive! Jesus, they're killin' each other. Mayday mayday, this is Raptor One to Argo. Argo, do you read? Copy, Raptor One. What's your status? We're screwed, that's what. And we got kids on board. We're gonna need immediate mid-air retrieval. Lock on to their position and prepare the hangar for an emergency landing. Hangar doors are unresponsive. Manual override? They're stuck! Alright, which way to the hangar? I can show you. Anybody else? I know the way, I... Come on! I hope you got a big wrench. What's the problem? Hydraulic systems are jammed. I'm trying to jump start power. It's not looking good. It's Admiral Stenz. Admiral. Dr. Serizawa, Col. Foster, I need you and your forces to immediately disengage and withdraw to a safe distance. Admiral, I don't understand. We have been developing a prototype for a new weapon. An Oxygen Destroyer. Designed to exterminate all life forms within a two-mile radius. With any luck, it will kill these things and this nightmare will finally be over. Admiral, we must keep our faith in Godzilla. I'm sorry, Doctor, you had your chance. The missile is already on its way. May God have mercy on us all. He's not lying. It's coming in hot. Argo, you gotta get this 'Sprey to a good wing now! Have the crash and fire crews ready! What the hell do you think you're doing?! Look out! Hold on! Come on, Griff! Head in! Head in! That's what I'm talkin' about, Griff! Everybody okay? Get on to the back. Yo, thanks for the lift! Oh, God. We're gettin' outta here. Military launched a weapon. It's gonna kill 'em both. Well, that's not the worst idea. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Three. Two. Jesus. Dr. Stanton, can you locate Godzilla? Yeah, I got somethin'. His vitals are fading. Radiation levels are plummeting. Come on, big guy, fight it. He's gone. Looks like you got your wish, Mark. Monarch Outpost 55 Sedona, Arizona Monarch Outpost 67 Munich, Germany I thought we were going to release them gradually. One at a time. I'm not the one doing this. Long live the king. You're a monster. Mothra Cocoon Site Yunnan Rainforest, China Castle Bravo, this is containment team Mosura. Do you read? Over. - Castle Bravo, this is... - Anything? Dr. Brooks. We've lost contact with the Argo, Castle Bravo and the other containment sites. Angkor Wat, Skull Island, Stone Mountain. All the Titans. They're escaping. Wait, wait, wait. It's-It's him. He's the one doing this. They're responding to his call. Where's Dr. Ling? She's outside. Dr. Ling! We've lost contact with Monarch. Dr. Ling? - Madison, wait. - Get away from me. Look, I know things haven't gone exactly according to plan, but - I can fix this. - "According to plan"? You said that you were gonna be careful, that you'd release them one at a time, that you would restore balance. They were gonna take over Monarch and kill the Titans. I didn't have a choice. Bullshit. You said we were doing this for Andrew. Do you really think he would have wanted this? Exactly. Madison. Madison. Any luck? No. Whatever Emma used to create the Orca signal, I've never heard it. How are you doing? How's that? Make this our compass. It's something my mom used to say. She believed our stories about monsters and dragons could help us find the Titans and restore our connection to nature. Wait, your mother? You're second generation Monarch? Third. It runs in the family. That's incredible! I don't suppose your family has any tips on slaying dragons, do they? Slaying dragons is a Western concept. In the East, they are sacred, divine creatures who brought wisdom, strength, even redemption. This Oxygen Destroyer... Why wasn't Monster Zero affected? I mean, I'm no scientist but I think it had something to do with his goddamn head growing back. I never seen anything like it. Violates everything we know about the natural order. Unless he's not part of the natural order. What do you mean? I was able to piece this together. Well, he looks vaguely familiar. It tells of a great dragon who fell from the stars. A Hydra whose storms swallowed both men and gods alike. You mean an alien? Yes. He's not part of our natural order. And he's not meant to be here. A false king. The invasive species. That could explain how he's creating these massive storms and the effect he's having on the other Titans. It's almost like he's reshaping the planet to his own liking. These legends, what did they call him? Ghidorah. The One Who is Many. - Gi-what? - She seriously say gonorrhea? Ghidorah! Dr. Serizawa, we're approaching Castle Bravo, but there's something you should see. I'm guessing you weren't expecting these guys. Moscow, London, Washington D.C. All under attack. On every continent, the Titans are triggering earthquakes, wildfires, tsunamis and disasters we don't even have names for yet. Now, as before, we have been trying to lure the creatures with nuclear materials, but they are not taking the bait this time. Their behavior has become random, erratic. And with our forces spread desperately thin and these things roaming the globe unimpeded, we are running out of options and time. Excuse me, do you have something to add? Yeah. You're wrong. Their behavior is not random or erratic. If I may, sir? As amazing as this sounds, they're moving like a pack. They're hunting. All packs, from wolves to killer whales, they all respond directly to an alpha. And this Ghidorah is the new alpha and all all the other creatures are just doing his bidding. They're-They're an extension of him. We stop him... we stop them all. Is there another creature that might stand a chance against him? No. Ghidorah and Godzilla's rivalry was ancient and unique. Right, so we killed our best shot at beating this thing? Jonah, you don't get it. This changes everything. With Godzilla gone, Monster Zero isn't using the Titans to restore the planet. He is using them to destroy it. This isn't coexistence. This is extinction. Listen, while you were sitting comfortably in some laboratory, we've been fighting for decades in one dirty war after another. I've seen human nature firsthand, and I'm here to tell you that it doesn't get any better. It just gets worse. So I'm sorry that Monster Zero isn't exactly what we were expecting. But we opened Pandora's Box. And there's no closing it now. Maybe there is. Oh, don't be stupid. You broadcast again and you will expose us all. These creatures communicate like whales, okay? They can hear sonar for thousands of miles, so... Let's send a team, let's broadcast the Orca from Fenway. It's just a few miles from here. I could use the stadium to amplify a signal that might stop these attacks. The city's already being evacuated, so we'll be safe. - And then what? - I don't know. Figure out what the hell Monster Zero really is and try to stop it. Before Monarch finds us. I'm sure your old friends will be very happy to see you again. We can't just sit here, all right? This isn't the world that we wanted. I seem to remember you telling me that the world always belonged to them. Maybe it is time we gave it back. Mark! Mark, wait. What are you doing? I can't just sit down there. I gotta do something. - Like what? - Like go find my daughter. H-How? Where are you gonna go? She's the only thing I got left, Sam. I'm what she's there for. Not gonna let that happen again. Good luck. Beautiful. Mothra. Queen of the Monsters. Are you recording this, Stanton? I record everything, man. Everything. It's like a song. I bet there's only one thing that can understand this. Godzilla. Yeah, I got it. Pickin' up the reply. Bringing it up. He's still alive. So, her and... Godzilla, they, like... they got a thing goin' on? That's kinda messed up, right? Symbiotic relationships between two different species aren’t all that uncommon. Can you track him? No. Signal's too weak. But maybe she can. How many nukes do you have? Why? We could help him. This Category 6 hurricane over D.C. is where King Ghidorah is nesting. Working with all four branches of the military, this will be a joint operation. To lure it away from the mainland so that we can continue evacuations. Long enough for our submersible team to complete its mission. So this plan is what you call a long shot, right? What do those nerds think they're gonna do down there with a bunch of nukes? You didn't hear 'em, Griffin? They wanna bring Godzilla back from the dead. You'll be out of range while you're down there but a squadron will stay behind to keep an eye out for you. Appreciate it. Alrighty, Bowman. Let's take her down. Dive the ship. Make depth 150. Good luck. Thanks, Sam. We'll need it. What time is it? Time to get talking watch. Andrew's favorite joke. You never took that watch out of your pocket without him asking that question. If you told me five years ago I'd be trying to save the thing that took my son, or it would be the only way to save the family I loved, I'd... Sometimes, the only way to heal our wounds is to make peace with the demons who created them. You really believe that? Don't you? Isn't that why you are here? There are some things beyond our understanding, Mark. We must accept them and learn from them. Because these moments of crisis are also potential moments of faith. A time, when we either come together or fall apart. Nature always has a way of balancing itself. The only question is, what part will we play? Did you just make that up? No. I read it in a fortune cookie once. A really long fortune cookie. Status on the ship? Some sort of vortex got us, it's dragging us. 1,600 feet till impact. 800 feet! Emergency close, 200 feet. 100! 25! Brace for impact! Boston Admiral, this is USS Brody en route to evacuation perimeter Weapons hot, ready to engage Titans on your command. Jesus. It's like the whole sky's alive. That's because it is. Here we go. Status report. Can't fix our position, GPS is down. But inertial says we're at... 600 miles from departure. That can't be. I knew it, man! The vortex was a tunnel into the hollow Earth. It's a subterranean... tunnel system that-that connects the entire planet. Doesn't matter. I knew I was right. I told you, Chen! Shut up, Rick. We'll take an emergency pull forward. Doctor? Launch probes. Range, 1,000 meters. Camera, good. Holding in range. Steady. Jesus. Pan right. Looks Egyptian. - Or Roman. - No. This is somethin' different. This is... This is way older. Oh, my. All the legends. The stories. They're true. They really were the first gods. If only the Earth and stones could speak, the stories they could tell us. Dr. Stanton, any sign of Godzilla? Yeah, the probe is picking up a radioactive blob just past that ridge. Set the course. Attention please. Martial law is now instated by order of the President. The Greater Boston Area is now under military supervision. All citizens should report to the nearest evacuation center for immediate transport. I repeat. All citizens are to report to the nearest evacuation... Massive storms and other disasters triggered by the Titans have forced millions to flee major cities. And with D.C. hit hard by a Category 6 hurricane that has left the capital completely flooded, this is the single greatest disaster in human history. The grim search continues as people around the world sift through the debris of leveled homes in the hope of finding missing loved ones. And though this sight is heartbreaking, it is unfortunately nothing unique. Cities around the globe have fallen under a wave of what many are calling "The Rise of the Titans". I think we should stop. Why? 'Cause I still wanna have kids one day. Preferably without flippers. We'll stop, over the ship. I got O2, CO2 and methane. It looks there's some sort of air pocket in there. - My God... - Zilla. Ah, goodnight, Gracie. Pull up the last frame. There, the source of the radiation. That's why he returned here. He's feeding. Regenerating. This is his home. This is how he survived for so long. Always adapting. Evolving. It's incredible. So, dude's got this covered, right? H-He just needs a little nap. No. This process could take years. We have to proceed as planned. Hang on. We're gonna launch a nuclear torpedo in order to revive a giant monster. Okay? This is-This is not like we're just jump-starting a car. We have another complication. Our weapon systems were damaged during the crash. - We can't launch. - Can it be repaired? I'm afraid not. Okay. What if we go inside, set a timer, and blow up the warhead manually? No way. If the heat doesn't fry you, the radiation will. I'll go. What the hell does that mean? There must be another way. There's no time for debate. I'll go. Argo! We are red on ammo and low on fuel! We can't take much more of this! Copy. Copy. Just hold them off as long as you can! Colonel, take a look at this. All the Titans have stopped. What the hell's gotten into them now? It does appear as if the attacks have ceased for the time being. With the creatures going from destructive to docile within minutes. Now, no one is sure how or why, but this seems to be happening simultaneously around the world. What's goin' on? The Orca. What? I wonder who could have done this. Maddie? Maddie. First contact, you're gonna start losing your long-range vision. When you surface, motor skills are gonna start to fade, but I put a heliox mixture in the tank which... should help you stay stable a little longer. It was an honor. Thank you. My notes. Are you sure? He fought for us. Died for us. He's not only proof that coexistence is possible. He is... the key to it. Take care of them, Mark. Bowman, take us out, fast. Aye, Captain. He's clear. Goodbye... ...old friend. You all right? Bowman, send a distress message to the Argo. Aye, Captain. See anything? Nobody move! Are you okay? I know how to find him. I know how to find him! Let's make him proud, not screw this up. - How did he, uh...? - By saving us. Sam, what do we got going on? We think Emma activated the Orca somewhere near Boston. That's why Ghidorah and Godzilla are both headed that way now. But we haven't been able to pinpoint the exact location without the missing piece of the Orca's signal. I've got the missing piece. It's Godzilla, right? But I know we already tried... It's not Godzilla. It's us. What do you mean "us"? Emma combined the bioacoustics of Godzilla with a human. That's how she made the signal for the Orca. The creatures just think it's another apex predator. Well, that makes sense. I mean, we are a bunch of horny, murderous carnivores. Yeah, that's real poetic. Now, what? We track it, we find it, we get my daughter back. What about Moe, Larry and Curly over here? Godzilla will bring balance. Oh, I get it. A little Serizawa let-'em-fight action. I used to love it when he said that. No, this time we join the fight. What do you think you're doing? I don't have time to argue about this, Jonah. I'm getting Maddie back. Not with my men, you're not. Emma, you said this was about the greater good. That the planet deserved a clean slate. But now you're prepared to put all our lives in danger because your little girl is missing. - The Orca is with... - The Orca no longer matters. Man does not control the laws of nature. And neither do you. I already lost one child. I'm not losing another. I have to fix this. Let her go. We have everything we need. Oh, shit. Okay, we've zeroed in on the last ping from the Orca. Fenway Park, dead ahead. We'll lay cover fire to keep Ghidorah distracted. Copy that. Colonel, all squadrons are locked on target. For Serizawa. Is it just me, or... has he been working out? You kiddin' me? Serizawa's got that lizard juiced! Damn right. Oh, boy. Godzilla's radiation levels are goin' through the roof. We got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear. What do you mean? I'm saying, in about 12 minutes, it's gonna be a bad day to be a Red Sox fan. Okay, guys, you need to find the Orca, get Madison and get the hell outta there! Whatever Serizawa did to Godzilla worked a little too well, 'cause he's about to explode like an atom bomb. - Watch left. - Prepare for landing. Go! Go! Madison! I found something! Over here! Come check this out! Are you alright? I found the Orca, sir. Looks pretty banged up. No sign of your daughter. She's back there! - We gotta get outta here! - Let's go! Get in! Incoming! Get in! Griffin, you alright? Martinez, let's get her up! Where's Madison? I don't know, I thought she was there! Well, she's not there! I can't get anything! - Get that slack! - Okay, okay! Look out! I hope you're as good as finding her as you are of losing her. I didn't lose her, she ran away! Well, gee, I wonder why! I can't blame that kid. If I had these two for parents, I'd run away from home, too. What did you just say? If I had the two of you for parents, I'd run away from home, too. - Home. - Home. Godzilla's radiation's reaching critical mass! Six minutes until he blows! Order all remaining craft to retreat! Maddie! - Madison! - Maddie! Madison! Madison! Madison! Emma! Maddie! Martinez! We got her. On three! One, two, three! Oh, my baby... Is she breathing? Roger that. Osprey's comin' in two minutes! We gotta work fast! To do what? You sure about this? It's the only way to save him. We fix it, get on the Osprey, draw that thing away from Godzilla. Buy him time to get back on his feet. Mark, you've seen what that thing can do. I know. It'll be tight, but we have to take that chance. - Are you good to go? - Yes. All right, one, two, three. That's it. That's it! Come on, Emma, let's go! Okay. Take her, take her. - I still have to activate it. - What? I'm right behind you. Go! Let's go! Mom! Mom! Come on, Maddie! Go, go, go! Maddie, do you have pain anywhere besides the leg? - We gotta lift off, now! - Wait! Emma, let's go, come on! Mom! - No! Mom! - Emma! No! No! Mom! Long live the king. Jesus. Good thing he's on our side. For now. Look. subs by enwansix
