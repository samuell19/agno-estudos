[music playing] REPORTER [ON TV]: The Russians have finally taken action after dealing with years of political turmoil in Tajikistan. Over 200 tanks with support troops have moved in to quell the uprising. While refugees by the thousands flood Red Cross shelters in neighboring Uzbekistan, the Kremlin claimed to be making short-term police actions. But reports from Tajikistan indicate the locals are preparing for the grim specter of a long-term Soviet occupation. [music playing] AMANDA: The "Gateway Space Station," our stepping stone to the stars, a conduit for future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond. What you're looking at here is two thirds of the station. "Gateway's" lower and mid station are semi operational. They're connected by this elevator. The upper station should be finished by year's end. Once the station is complete, the centrifugal force of orbit will create micron gravity on the upper and lower station, gravity essential for research in space. The mid station has what we call magnetized gravity. Micro thin strips of steel are placed in the astronauts' mission suits and equipment. We magnetize the floors and, voila, gravity. Now, if y'all come with me, I'd like to introduce you to the crew for our first international mission to the station. [music playing] Ladies and gentlemen, our crew led by Captain Previ Federov of the Russian Republic. If you have any questions, please. Yes, Captain, you've been on so many missions. Has it become at all routine? Routine? No, never. REPORTER: How does it feel to be the first non-Americans to command a shuttle mission? It is both an honor and a privilege, especially for a young man from Moscow who was not very good at math. REPORTER: Is it difficult being the only American member of this flight crew? No, we've trained many months for this. We don't anticipate any problems. Do you like America, Captain? I've been here before. I studied at the University of Pennsylvania for three years. So it's not exactly my first taste of America. How does it taste? I like your apple pie. Your football confuses me, nobody uses their feet. In the back. Captain, you were born in Tajikistan. How do you feel about Russia's intervention? My country's history is a history of sorrows. We have never enjoyed the freedoms that you enjoy in the West. Now it looks as though we never will. REPORTER: So you're against Russia's intervention? As a boy growing up, I had a dream to fly in space. Russia gave me that dream. I will not judge her. Anytime people cannot solve their differences, when they must use guns to find peace, when they are willing to let their country become subject to another nation, that is tragedy. My prayers go out to the young men of Russia and Tajikistan, to the boys that will suffer and die for the misunderstandings of old men. That's all the time we have. One more question, please. [interposing voices] All right, JJ, let's rev her up and bring her down nice. No bumps or bruises this time, OK? PRITCH: Roger that. Re-entry computer on. Trajectory engaged. Burning aft thrusters. [bang] PRITCH: Give me a 12-second burn at 70%. Bring the nose around. That's it. Almost there. OK, JJ, get ready to serve the skies. Ah-oh. What ah-oh? What's wrong? PRITCH: Just a little company, nothing to worry about. Keep your eyes on the fancy buttons and the flashing lights. I'll do the rest, OK? HENDRICKS: Switching to manual. Once the "X-33" is operational, it will be able to take on demand any major runway in the world. It's gas-and-go prep time means that it could launch in a matter of hours at 10% of a shuttle budget. All right, bringing the nose around minus 45 degrees. So this thing can take off from Tokyo or Los Angeles? It would make a little more noise than I think people could tolerate, but, yes, it could happen. You're getting it warm, JJ, but you're fine. Let's get it right this time. We've got a crowd out here. How soon will this be ready? Two years, maybe less. What you're looking at is a test of the re-entry procedure. I'm getting hotter, Pritch. You can ease her up a little bit. No can do. Hold her at 15 degrees. You're fine. So this will fly right into space? That's right, right into "Gateway's" lower station, where it exchanges passengers and then returns to its runway of choice. This re-entry and landing procedure, it's fairly basic. I'm putting in a 12-degree angle, see if I could slip around with less resistance. PRITCH: 15 degrees, JJ. Anything less, and we'll bounce right out of the atmosphere. HENDRICKS: It's too hot. I'm burning up in here. [alarm] PRITCH: Hang on, JJ, a few more seconds, and you've got it. HENDRICKS: A few more seconds, and I'll blow the hydrogen tank. I got a blowout. Those tanks will take 2,500 plus. You're fine. Just keep her coming. [alarm] If this what you call a smooth transition, I'd like to see your bumpy ride. Are pilots are the best in the world. Sometimes it gets a little hot in there. [alarm] 2,300. I got to pull her up 12 degrees. Three more seconds. Hold on, JJ, you can do it. [alarm] The bottom is melting. I got to pull out. Hang on, JJ. I'm pulling out! ANNOUNCER: Catastrophic system failure. Dammit. JJ, wait. Please, follow me. JJ. Why did you pull out? The "X-33" is nothing more than a fuel sack with a pilot. Every engineering spec I've read said hydrogen blows at 2,500 degrees. I'm not dying in that thing. Yeah, well, pulling up like that just bounced you all the way to Venus. - The computer bounced, not me. - What? You heard what I said. The simulator is wrong. I know how to make an approach. 12 degrees would be just fine. It's 15 degrees. Face it, JJ, you bounced out. - What? What are you saying? There was pilot error? No, it's pilot arrogance. The simulator is right. 99.9% of the time I can't say you and Roger are the same. Then find a better pilot. I don't want a better pilot. I want a better you. You don't like this year's model? Don't buy it. Why is it you always put me in front of the press junkets? Because you're the most photogenic engineer I've got. You mean, the only one with breasts. I hadn't noticed. How did it go? Great, until Hendricks bounced the "X-33." Again? What's he doing flying sims? This doesn't have anything to do with his accent, does it? He made a mess for us, Amanda. So you grounded him? Not that hard. We scratched him from commanding the launch and offered to send him up as Federov's copilot. And? He refused. How's work going on the remote link? Fixed? I can't tell yet. Nevsky says everything's A-OK, but the diagnostics are coming out wrong. - He hasn't found the bug? - Nope. You think you could? Oh, Pete, it's a hardware problem. I'd have to check every component on the station. Then why don't we do that? You can't just bring the computer down. Taking it apart would take months. PETE: I have no intention of bringing it down. I'm sending you up unless, of course, you have a better idea. But what about the tech team? Why don't you send them up? I don't know that they can fix it. I do know that you can, which is why I'm sending you. Pete, I am not prepared. I am a computer systems specialist. I am not an astronaut. "Atlantis" doesn't leave for two weeks. That's enough time to bring you up to speed on the basics. Now, what about Ethan? I can't just leave him alone. Ethan can stay at my house. I'm sure Sarah won't mind watching him for a couple of days. It's one thing to have bad luck. It's another thing to go out and make it. This seems wrong. I can take it in to 12 degrees. Then work with me on it, not against me. Besides, you could use a few friends around here. Why don't you take a mission as co-pilot, go up and show them they can trust you? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your title these days, Pritch? Chief engineer of advanced aerospace technology is correct? OK, so what would you do if they asked you to test the fuel mixtures? They wouldn't. They have got lab guys that do that kind of thing. I realize that, but if they did. I quit. Bingo. I'm a flight commander with three missions under his belt. I'm nobody's copilot. What about the "X-33"? You're the only guy trained to fly. As soon as it's ready-- What about the "X-33"? That thing is not going to be ready for flight for two years. By the time they get it up there, I'll be teaching rookies how to fly it. You know it, and I know it. Let's face it. If I don't get this next mission, I'll be testing sims the rest of my career. Interesting piece of lying you pulled off this morning, Captain Hendricks. The simulator is busted. Or so you say. I'd like to give it a try, if you don't mind, I think I saw the cause of the problem. What? You think you could do it better? Maybe, who knows. Maybe? Well, it's optimistic. I heard a lot about you, Captain. Where I come from, we have a saying, if you can't control your wings, don't reach for the sky. I'll reach for anything I want, thanks. Or crash into it. AMANDA: Captain, If you don't mind me saying, I expect more from a man who's about to lead me into space. My apologies, Mrs. McCord, If you'll excuse me. Lead you into space? You're going up? That's right. I can't say I'm excited about it, but yes, I'm going. Amazing. You know, Captain, if you didn't have such a chip on your shoulder, maybe you wouldn't have such a crack in your record. You're a great pilot. Why don't you start believing in yourself and prove it? Oh, see, Pritch, I'm making new friends already. [game sounds] [crickets] Honey, what are you doing up? ETHAN: Are you really going into space? You bet. But you don't want to go? No, I want to go. I just want to bring you with me, but I can't. Can I go when I'm bigger? When you're big enough, you'll be able to go anytime you want. Really? Really. Now, come on, I want you to go to sleep. Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'll see you in the morning. OK. I'll call you when I get to the Cape, OK? Can you take this with you? Of course I can, honey. It'll bring you good luck. Ah, thanks. Thanks, Sarah and Pete. I really appreciate this. Just remember, no soda after 8 o'clock. Got it, 8 o'clock. OK, I love you, honey. Be a good boy. Good luck, Amanda. [music playing] FEDEROV: Mrs. McCord, I hope what happened the other day will not create a problem for us. It's already forgotten. I'd like to apologize. Apology accepted, not necessary, but accepted. Friends? Friends. Or how we say in Russian, druzia. This is a stabilization bed. But you will receive medical attention if you suffer from space sickness. How long you staying? It depends on your stomach. And we always strap in. OK. And, uh, this vacuum here is around two minutes before. And here, well, uh, you figure it out for yourself. Where do we flush? Flush it over here like that. And then this is for the privacy. Yeah? Thank you. [music playing] PRITCH: You're fine, JJ. Put her in a 15-degree pitch. We're almost there. [alarm] It's too hot. Trust me on this one. She won't burn up One more minute. [alarm] ANNOUNCER: Catastrophic system failure. [alarm] Dammit! You almost had it, JJ. I can't believe I burned it up again. Let's keep trying. Come on. Hey, Pritch, in case you didn't notice, if that thing had been real in there, I'd be dead right now. That's it. I'm through. The "Atlantis" takes off tomorrow. It could have been you, JJ. It could have been you. [music playing] Mrs. McCord, is this your boy? Oh, I forgot it, yes. His name is Ethan. I found it taped to your locker. Would you like me to put it in your mission case? Thank you. I'd like that. He's got your eyes, like a fox. A fox? Quick, insightful, always on guard. He'll be a smart boy. I'm sure he gets that from you. Well, the less he's like his father, the better. You're divorced? Five years and counting. I'm sorry. Oh, don't be. I'm not. Can I tell you a secret? When they strap you in for launch, think of your boy, of him playing with his favorite toy. I have four boys of my own in Tajikistan. I think of them every time I leave the Earth. It helps take the fear away. Thank you. REPORTER [ON TV]: Local residents were shocked this morning when a T38 jet crashed into their quiet neighborhood. Captain Jim Hendricks ejected from his jet when it's engine failed, but how Captain Hendrick's jet ended up here almost 300 miles off course, no one knows. But how Captain Hendrick's jet ended up here almost 300 miles off course-- almost 300 miles off course, no one knows. The countdown continues for the venerable shuttle "Atlantis." Lift off is on schedule for 6:30 AM Eastern time. This turned out to be quite a mission with its half Russian crew and the last minute addition of Amanda McCord, a NASA computer specialist who is being sent up to "Gateway" to track down some persistent computer problems. The shuttle crew should be arriving at the launch platform now. Now we see the pilot getting into his seat. T-minus five minutes, and the external tank being pressurized for flight. [machine sound] [rocket engine] ANNOUNCER: We've got green lights across the board. Houston, this is "Atlantis," all systems go. T minus 1 minute to launch Canaveral. This is Houston. It's your show. [inaudible] CAPTAIN: [inaudible] ANNOUNCER: The OAA, or the Orbiter Access Arm, is being retracted away. This is the walkway used by the crew to gain entry into and out of the vehicle. ANNOUNCER: Commence main engine re-ignition. CAPTAIN: Re-ignition engaged. [rocket launch] [rumble] ANNOUNCER: "Atlantis" has liftoff. Houston, Atlantis has cleared the tower. Roger, launch control. We'll take it there. Beginning roll, Houston. Roger, "Atlantis," you're go for a throttle up. Main engine firing. "Atlantis" you are go for SRV separation. SRV separation in T-minus 10. ANNOUNCER: Solid rocket booster is clear. Recovery team en route. SRV tracking confirmed. "Atlantis," this is CAPCOM, all clear for MECO. Main engine cutoff complete. ET separation in T-minus five, four, three, two, one. [beep] External tank separated. ANNOUNCER: External tank clear, recovery team en route. External tank tracking confirmed. Take a look. "Atlantis, you can proceed with OHM burn. After rockets firing. We have established orbit, switching to manual. WOMAN: All right! We made it. MAN: Good one. MAN: Thanks. WOMAN: Nice job, everyone. [background conversations] Great work. Easiest one yet. WOMAN: Perfect, that was just perfect. Didn't see you at the launch this morning. Sleep late? I want to command the next mission to "Gateway." You and everybody else in the program. You owe me, Pete. I don't owe you anything, JJ. We offered to send you up. I want to command a mission. And I think you should, but I'm not going to give you one, not unless you tell me why you-- Not this again. It was my jet. PETE: Yours to fly, not to crash. And why were you so far off your flight plan? You cooperate, or you don't get a mission. So that's it then? That's it. My request to be discharged. Is this what you want? It doesn't have to be like this. I think it does. [music playing] You ever see it before? I just never thought I'd see it this close. [music playing] "Gateway," this is "Atlantis," all clear for docking. How was the trip, Captain? CAPTAIN [ON SPEAKER]: By the numbers. Prepare to initiate docking procedure. KOMOROV: Docking procedure initiated. I'll guide you from here. [music playing] That's a lock, "Atlantis." [beep] Oh, Amanda, I never thought I'd see the day. Captain, it's good to see you again. It's good to see you too. Captain Federov, George Tanner, pleased to make your acquaintance. Thank you for having us, Captain. Oh, please, it's all my pleasure after four months, any new face through that portal was welcome. Listen, after you folks get changed and get out of your suits, how about I give you a grand tour of the facility? That would be nice, thank you. I'd like to get some sleep, if you don't mind. Oh, not at all. Why don't you get 40 winks, and we'll reconvene in two hours. Michaels will show you to your quarters, and Mafa, you show these gentlemen to their quarters. And you, young lady, get the tragic misfortune of having me be your escort. Be my pleasure. This one go through the research lab, yeah? No, no, no, no, no, this is mine. I'll take later. The big one goes through the cargo bay. And in the black one, take it to the library. [knock] Thank you. How about that remote link? I've got Nevsky working on it, all day every day, 24/7. He can't do anything-- [knock] --without checking in with me. That system shouldn't be malfunctioning. TANNER: Well, I'm sure whatever's wrong with it, he'll have it up and running. Good as new. Now, why don't we have some lunch? I have got a bottle of vintage apple juice. No, thanks, I really want to take a look there. Amanda, you just got here. AMANDA: I know, but I won't be able to think about anything else until I get a good look at it. Now where can I find Nevsky? Well, he's got to be around somewhere. There aren't that many places to hide. Why don't we start with the remote link? OK. Come on. [music playing] [electronic sounds] NEVSKY: It doesn't like me either. Ivan Nevsky. I'm glad to finally meet you, Amanda. And, uh, I'm sorry you had to come all the way up here. It's bound to happen sooner or later. [electronic sounds] Well, you won't find anything. I've checked the cords and the hardware 100 times and still nothing. Nothing wrong, and nothing works. Hmm. Very strange. Are you the only one that's worked on it? As far as I know, yes. Well, I don't see anything wrong with it right now. I'll start in again in the morning. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight. [suspenseful music] [knock] She knows. FEDEROV: Knows what? Amanda, she's been in the remote link. You said you could hide it. NEVSKY: Yes, for most people, yes, but not her. She designed it. She knows. I know she does. We'll move up the schedule. TANNER: Amanda, what the hell are you talking about? Someone sabotaged the remote link. No. No, it's not possible. What do you know about Nevsky? Nevsky was a weapons specialist for the Soviets. Hmm. Huh? What do you mean, huh? You don't think that-- [beep] Oh, that. We've got a message coming in from Houston. You're going to want to look right over here. Hi, mom. Ethan, honey, what are you doing up so late? Uncle Pete said I could call and say goodnight. PETE: I hope you don't mind him staying up this late. How was the shuttle ride? It was bumpy. Did you get sick? No, honey, mommy didn't get sick. Are the cameras off? They're looping. He said it's time. All the way, comrades, all the way or nothing. Hello, Captain. [gunshot] [groan] Now you go to bed. It's past your bedtime. Goodnight, mom. Goodnight. We'll talk tomorrow, Houston out. I think it's time we get this young man on to bed. I don't get it. What do you think he's up to? She said he sabotaged the motherboard. She was right. He did. Stay away from the console. Come with me now. Where's Lieutenant Franklin? Dead. Dead? Are you out of your mind? [inaudible]. Move. Pete, we've got an anomaly on "Gateway." What kind of an anomaly? The video feed. The last 20 minutes, Lieutenant Franklin walked down that corridor twice. See, there he is again. That's the third time. Anomaly my ass, a man can't sleep. That's what I thought. There's no way to get from one end of the hall to the other. The feed is looping on us. Get Amanda back on the line. I'm not getting an answer. We just talked her, for Christ sakes. I've tried. The haven will be more than enough oxygen. What happened to friends? You're still alive, aren't you? How much air do we have? We got enough, enough for now. Activate the satellites . All right, the satellites are activated. And coming online. They're all there. Heidi at your disposal. initiating code encryption. [beep] Get Houston on the COM link. Anything? Not yet. We've tried every channel, digital, analog, and shortwave. We've got nothing. [electronic sounds] Now what? Beats me. FEDEROV [ON SPEAKER]: Exactly 10 minutes ago, the Nebulous Space Defense System was activated. The Russian Third Army Group has exactly 12 hours to withdraw its forces from People's Republic of Tajikistan. What the hell is this? FEDEROV [ON SPEAKER]: If they do not withdraw, I will launch the satellites. If you try to intercept or jam the signal, I will launch the satellites. This is Captain Previ Federov. The "Gateway" station is in my control. If you try to compromise this station, I promised you, I will launch all the satellites. [music playing] [electronic sounds] PETE: Federov, Jesus Christ. Who? How do I-- No, we should call NORAD. Anybody have the phone number to NORAD? Christ, people, get me a government phone book and get the number to NORAD. Ivan, now it's up to them. General Abrams. Pete, it seems like we have a little problem. That we do, sir, follow me. For 20 years, the best spies in the CIA assured me that the Nebulous System was a fake, a phantom weapon. Now all of a sudden, the Russian ambassador tells me it's for real. PETE: Can the Russians deactivate it? No, none of the old access codes work. The Russians say the only person to turn them off is up there on "Gateway." Nevsky. Yeah, he designed the system. It turns out that he, Federov, and Brodovky were all born in Tajikistan. And the Russians, they are considering their options. So the question of the hour is, how soon can we get a shuttle up there? 34 days. What about NORAD? Can we knock them out of the sky? ABRAMS: Then the satellites would never have a chance of hitting all of them. I'd target that station, but it's beyond the legitimate range of anything we've got. Now, from what we have received from Russian intelligence and what our own people at the Pentagon have figured is that Federov has hooked up all of these satellites to an encrypted code system. Defense Intelligence has the best programmers working on it, but they say it will take them at least a week to break it, if at all. So assuming we cannot break the code and assuming Federov really does have control of all those satellites, what are my options? How do I get my people up there? The "X-33." Your report said it would not be operational for years. We have a prototype ready. ABRAMS: How many men can it take? 3 with a pilot. Who do you plan on sending up there, General? I'll have a team of Rangers here within the hour. Rangers? US Army Special Forces. Believe it or not, gentlemen, we have trained for this. Here's the problem, General, the only pilot trained to fly the "X-33" handed in his resignation yesterday. You still got his letter? Tear it up. I want him here, now. [music playing] [door knock] Yeah? Sir, you need to come with us. All right, come on in, I got to change. [music playing] For freedom. [speaking russian] [beep] [rocket launch] Look, Captain, I just want to emphasize the word if again. If the Russians don't pull their tanks back, and if Federov is for real, you're going to have to go up there and deliver my Rangers right off "Gateway." Do you understand that? We still haven't figured out a way to bring the "X-33" back down. Pete. The Rangers will board at mid station. As soon as they secured the comm center, you dock at the lower station. Take the elevator up. You all come home in the "Atlantis." Why not just dock the "X-33"? PETE: The shuttle is in the docking bay. Even if it weren't, Federpv would see you coming. This is our only shot. You make it. You got any command you want. And if I don't? I never said there wasn't any risk involved. Pete, we're tracking one of the Nebulous satellites. [music playing] Where is it headed? Right on top of us. How long till impact? [explosion] Jesus, you blew it up just outside the atmosphere. Any fallout? No, it's too deep into space to cause any damage. But he knew exactly where to detonate it. Those Russian bastards better pull back. [music playing] Wait a second. We've got an incoming signal. By now you've seen the power of the Nebulous System. Consider that a warning shot. The next satellite detonates 10 miles over a major US city. The fallout would decimate the population. All right, Federov, what's going on? Why us? Those are not our tanks attacking your country. It's not our war. It is now. Russia won't listen to me. They may listen to you. After all, you are the only world superpower. You've got eight hours to convince Russia to withdraw. If they don't, I launch the next satellite. Eight hours, and I want proof. Want some kind of relief? Can I help you? I certainly hope so. Captain Hendricks, I'm your pilot. Lieutenant Sittins, US Rangers. Well, what the hell is that thing? It's a recoiless rifle, zero displacement with zero gravity engagements. It uses compressed lead powder shells. Hit something solid, and it breaks up on impact. Hit something that breathes, and that baby will rip through it like a hot knife. Hmm, well, it's nice to know you're prepared. Hmm, prepared my ass. When I signed up for this unit, I thought it was going the biggest damn vacation in the Army. Then some lieutenant calls me and says, congratulations, tells me I've got a mission. Go figure. All right, well, as soon as you're done, step right through that doorway, and we'll get suited up. I'll show you what we wear in my world. You heard him. I'll go check on the shuttle. I'll go with him. [music playing] Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Once in orbit, we regret to inform you that there will be no refreshments and no in-flight movie. Enjoy the flight, and thank you for flying NASA. [beep] ANNOUNCER: Systems check complete, you are A-OK to go. TOWER [ON RADIO]: Captain, this is tower. You're clear for take off. OK, boys, hold on. It might get a little bumpy. [rumble] Mission control, we have liftoff. All right, boys. The meter is running. AMANDA: There wasn't anything you could have done. This is my ship, my command. If I could just find a way to access the remote link. You told me there was no way you could get that thing to work. Not the way it's supposed to. Nevsky shut down Houston's ability to control the station from Earth. Now, if I can access the mainframe, we can control the station from here. OK. OK, now what do you need to do it? Blueprints, I need the blueprints. There's a com link to every module at the station. I just don't know where to look. Now, if we could get a hold of NASA, somehow I don't think Federov is going to give us any free calls home. KOMOROV: He doesn't have to. He can build a phone and call NASA from here. If you start with the intercom system-- What are you? Crazy? No, no, no, he's right. There must be a hundreds digital satellites floating around out here. Exactly. We can mirror one of the signals, and this could work. Yes, but we need an antenna. Here. There's a-- a mile of copper wire in here. Rip it out. I want you to build us a phone. I want you two to rig us an antenna. You and I have to find the power source to tap into. You start there. I'll start over here. Got it. We should be in striking distance soon. [music playing] Wow! She really is beautiful, takes your breath away. [music playing] Check your seals. I'll be depressurizing the cabin. Depressurizing on my mark, three, two, one. [air escaping] All right, men, get ready to move out. Give them hell, Rangers. [airlock] Good luck, guys. SITTINS: Houston, this is Eagle 1, commencing title launch. Roger, Eagle 1. [slash] There's something out there. Look, some sort of ship. It's only 100 yards from the station. How? There was nothing that could have made it up here. The "X-33" pilot, Hendricks finally made it off the ground. Follow me. FEDEROV: Batavki, your magazine. Real bullets. Lead bullets will not penetrate the EVA suits. SITTINS: Keep moving, Frasier. 50 yards to go. Murphy, stay in sync. MURPHY: Aye, sir. [gunfire] MURPHY: Houston,, we're under attack. Incoming! We've got incoming rival fire. I've been hit. ASTRONAUT: Move quickly, quickly. ASTRONAUT: Where are they? Where are they coming from? ASTRONAUT: We're being fired upon. SITTINS: Move it! Move it! [gunfire] Where is he? Ahh! ASTRONAUT: Bridge is hit. They got him. SITTINS: Houston, this is Eagle 1. We're sorry, guys. [gunfire] ABRAMS [ON RADIO]: Eagle 1, this is Houston, do you read? Eagle 1, this is Houston, do you read? Eagle 1, this Houston, do you read? Eagle 1, come in. Eagle 1. Eagle 1, come in. They're dead. They're all dead. I was very clear on one point, do not try to compromise this station. You have three hours to convince the Russians. Then I launch the satellite. Listen to me, Captain we are negotiating with the Russians, but we cannot just tell them what to do. They won't listen to that. Be patient. Then try harder. I have to inform the president. I can see their bodies from here, just floating out there. Think they'll ever make it back to Earth? Eventually. Listen, JJ, we think we found a new approach angle for the "X-33." There's a good chance you'll make it down fine. Right, down to what? I don't know, Pritch. I think I'd rather stay up here and take my chances. After all, it seems a shame to come all the way up here for nothing. Yes, Mr. President. Yes, sir. It's in the hands of the Russians right now. All we can do is-- - He's going to do it. One second, sir. He's going to do what? Hendricks. He's going into the mid station. Mr. President, we have a new development. Let me get briefed, and I'll get back to you. Thank you, sir. [music playing] Do you see it? Yes, I see it. Lift the dock manually. There's no one on board to bring you in, JJ. You want to come in straight. Bring it around to 86 degrees Earth relative. [metal clang] You'll have to do a space walk to the hatch, JJ. Be careful. I'm going to patch your head set through the "X-33" so you can talk to us when you need to on a secure channel, you hear me? Call us when you get inside. Oh, one more thing, JJ. The lower station is still at zero gravity, so be careful moving around. Lower stationis secured. Now what, Houston? You'll have to make a tether run. HENDRICKS: Why not take the elevator? PRITCH: Take the elevator, and he'll know you're there. A tether run, huh? This doesn't sound like a joyride. PRITCH [ON SPEAKER]: Come on, JJ. It's only 80 miles. Only? All right, where do I start? PRITCH [ON SPEAKER]: OK, you need an emergency harness. It should be there next to the portable thruster. I got it. You know, Pete, the hostages' only hope right now is Hendricks. He's our only hope. [music playing] OK, Pritch, how do I slow this thing down? With thruster burns, one every minute for the last 10 minutes. That should do it. HENDRICKS: What if it doesn't? PRITCH [ON SPEAKER]: You'd hit the mid station at 500 miles an hour. You wouldn't feel a thing. That's a refreshing thought. It's your decision. How do you feel about it, JJ? Look, if you're waiting for me to make a speech about how proud I am, don't hold your breath. Pritch? - I'm right here. HENDRICKS: Listen, that thing you said before about a better me, you're right. I'm sorry. That's OK, buddy. Call me when you get to "Gateway." Now initiate a three-second thruster burn. You got it. Houston, initiating thruster burn. See you guys in 80 miles, I hope. He's ready. All right, let's give it a shot. Houston, this is "Gateway." Do you read me? Houston, this is "Gateway." Do you read me? Think the Russians will pull out? Who knows. One thing about the Russians, they'd rather starve or freeze than give up. Ask Hitler. Pete, General, we've got an incoming call. It's Tanner. Tanner, what's going on up there? You guys all right? Yeah, yeah, Federov has got us locked up in cargo module number 3, and he's regulating the oxygen, but other than that, we're doing pretty good. Listen, Pete, Amanda thinks she can access the remote link, but she's going to need a little help from you boys down there. So I'm going to put her on, OK? PETE [ON RADIO]: All right, go ahead. AMANDA [ON RADIO]: Houston, this is McCord. Amanda, Fedrov has got the access codes encrypted up the yazoo. Truth is, I don't the remote link is going to do you any good. Listen, if I can connect to the remote link, I can get it in to the main computer. I can secure is access codes and disable them. You sure? Positive. I just need to get into the remote link from here. Pritch, get on it right away. How are you holding up, Amanda? OK, sir. Listen, we have a man on his way up there now. It's going to take him a while to get there, but when he does, well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we? OK, listen, how's Ethan? Does he know? I haven't said anything to him yet. Do you want me to? He's a smart kid. Just tell him the truth. "Gateway" out. [music playing] NEVSKY: Previ? Previ? Previ? You better come. They just started coming in. REPORTER [ON TV]: Suddenly halted operations that are now in a full-scale retreat out of Tajikistan. The Kremlin had no comment on the mysterious withdrawal except to say they believe they have the situation-- Well, done, Mr. President. Is your shuttle ready? Yes. Get on the intercom. Let the hostages know they'll be leaving. All right. But how can we be sure they won't cross back? If they cross back, we can still launch your system from the Earth. The connection is gone. Thank god I never have to live on this damn thing. We'll let them know when it's time. [inaudible]. OK, that should do it. Let's see what we've got here. OK, OK, I think I'm in. I just need to find the remote codes. She's doing it. I knew she would. Doing what? Commander, she's trying to find the access codes to the remote link. FEDEROV: Is it possible? NEVSKY: No! I don't know. She designed it. Maybe-- maybe there is something I don't know. Come with me. [speaking russian] OK, phone, Pete, I patched into the main computer. They're encrypted all right. Look, I'm going to have to send you the files down. It's going to take a minute. PETE: Amanda, if this works, Federov is going to do everything he can to use you as leverage. It's going to get ugly. I'll worry about that later. Lay down. Lay down. Pete, I can't. What did you tell him? I wanted to talk to my son. You are lying. You were trying to find out the codes. Do you think I want to go through with this, do you? My family, my brothers and sisters have known nothing but war for a decade, now, occupation. I can change this. You have child. Wouldn't you do the same? How many people would you kill for one life? If that child was my son, my niece or my nephew, I will kill as many as I have to. [explosion] Amanda, Amanda. The transmission is dead. [beep] What is it? What is that noise? He's raiding their oxygen supply. [music playing] The Russians have stopped. What do you mean stopped? Well-- well-- they're not moving. I checked the surveillance satellites. They are 80 kilometers from the border, just sitting there. What is this, Previ? Gentlemen, I have just received word that the Russian withdrawal has stopped. This is not good news. We're talking to them now, Previ. You've got to give us some time. Federov, they've run out of petrol. The damn Russians ran out of fuel. PETE [ON SPEAKER]: Did you hear that, Previ? They're out of gas. Idiots. Then get them some more. I'll give you one hour, one hour, and then one of your cities will burn, I promise you. Where the hell is Hendricks? JJ, where are you? We should have heard something. HENDRICKS [ON RADIO]: Houston, this is Hendricks. Approaching "Gateway." PRITCH: JJ, you should have hit your thrusters by now. You're too close. Fire them now! Firing thrusters! I'm in it. I actually made it. All right, now what? Look, Captain, here's the update. The hostages are being held in cargo bay 3. The Russians have stalled because of lack of fuel. Federov is going to launch one of his satellites in an hour. We have to know where. [music playing] [airlock] [airlock] [beep] [click] At least we did the right thing. I know. Someone is coming. [click] JJ. How did you-- Don't worry about that. How fast can you prep "Atlantis"? - Half hour tops. - Good. We're going home. Let's go. [airlock] Hey, how the hell do I get to com center from here? Down the hall. Doorway on the right. You can't miss it. Come on. I was kind of hoping for a back door. There's an electrical vent that leads to the mainframe. That worked just as well. All right, board "Atlantis," lay low until I get back. Then we'll all go home. No, no, JJ. I know this ship better than anybody. You need me. Captain, I'm coming too. Listen, if I could get into Federov's computer, I might be able to break down the codes and disable them. Komorov, you're in charge. Make sure everything is ready. Do it quietly. Let's go. [music playing] [electronic sounds] [click] All right, you can go down here, all the way to the end and make a right. ABRAMS: They're doing everything they can, Federov. It's not enough. ABRAMS [ON RADIO]: It's just a matter of fuel. We're airlifting them a supply now. Just give us three more hours. May god forgive me. [beep] He cut the feed. He's going to launch. Oh. Get every fighter we've got up into the air. Load them all up with heat-seeking missiles, and do it now. Can you track that thing? I don't know. He's got 79 of them up there. What about all those people? We have to let them know that we are serious. If we don't think of our people, think of the thousands who have died. We can stop this right here right now. Remember, all the way or nothing. What city? No cities. We launch on Death Valley. Program it. I do not want to kill anyone. I just want to let them know that we can and that we will. Now do it. [beep] [beep] It is done. Yes, sir, Mr. President, are planes are up. Thank you, sir. Hold on. Have we found it yet? It'll take time, General. We don't have time, Pritch. HENDRICKS [ON SPEAKER]: It's not headed for a city. It's coming down on Death Valley. Are you sure? I'm positive. It's Death Valley. Scramble the birds at El Toro. I've got it. It's coming across the Pacific. A hit in 31 minutes. Great work, JJ, we got it on radar now. Hang tight. We'll let you know what happens. Need someone to keep their eye on Federov. - I'll do it. - You sure? Of course I'm sure. Can't let you do all the work. They may crown you a hero when this thing blows over. Yeah, we wouldn't want that, would we? Not if I can help it. HENDRICKS: How can I help? Here, hold this. So how is that chip on my shoulder? Still there? I'm sorry. You know, it wasn't my place to make a judgment like that. HENDRICKS: No, no, you were right. It was there. You know, this is none of my business, but what happened in that accident? Why didn't you tell NASA that? They didn't need to know. MCCORD: Colegrove thought they did. Colegrove was wrong. What are you so afraid of? Not much anymore. You know what fear is? Fear is flying a T-38 with both your engines on fire, knowing that any minute, your jet might blow, and there's nothing you can do about it. There's no way to put those fires out. So you look for a safe place to ditch before you bail out, knowing that any second might be your last. That's fear. [rocket blast] They should have picked it up by now. BRAVO LEADER [ON RADIO]: NORAD, this is Bravo leader. I have visual on the bogey. Request permission to fire. MISSION CONTROL: Permission granted, Bravo. Fire when ready. Affirmative, waiting for live. [beep] Missiles armed. I have a lock. [beep] [launch] Launched two. [explosion] NORAD, we have a hit, target destroyed. All right, that's two down, so eight more to go. Contact Hendricks. Tell him we got it. [non-english] General, I'm sure by now your Death Valley has truly become the valley of death. I will give the Russians one more hour to withdraw their tanks. Then I'm going to launch eight more satellites. [airlock] I found it in one of their air locks. someone has come on board the station, Previ. The hostages are gone. Impossible. Who? Hendricks. He's going for the shuttle. Give me your gun. He's mine. [music playing] Get to the hatch! Watch out. It's been busted! [dramatic music] TANNER: JJ, I found your harness. They're on the way to the shuttle. They're on to us. Can we beat them there? No. They'll have to leave without us. "Atlantis," this is Captain Hendricks. Federov is on his way to the shuttle bay. Komorov, listen to me, I want you out of there now. Don't stop for anything. Don't come back. That's an order. Roger, Captain. Separating from docking bay. Good luck. [beep] [launch] [alarm] [speaking russian] He's going to launch the rest of them now. Can you disable the codes? Not from here. Nevsky's got the computers sealed off tight. What about shutting it down? Shut down what? HENDRICKS: The mainframe. If that's what Federov is using to launch these things, it stands to reason-- It stands to reason if we shut down the mainframe, we shut down our life support. We are not leaving here any time soon, JJ. If we rip out the mainframe, that's going to kill us. How do we do it? JJ, JJ, please, just think about this for a minute, will you? He's right. The station can only maintain hypostasis for half an hour. After that, we die. You have a little boy at home, don't you? [music playing] [click] ANNOUNCER: Warning, all systems shutting down. Emergency power activated. Life support-- Ivan, they're shutting down the main power. Switch your computer to emergency back up. I'm working on it. [music playing] Done. It's on emergency power now. FEDEROV: Set time to launch. We can't. We can, and we will. All or nothing. We agreed all or nothing. Set time to launch in 15 minutes. Does the intercom still work? It should. You've killed us all Hendricks. I'll hand you that. But you have not saved the world. When I die, millions will die with me. If you could get to his computer, could you disable the countdown? I think so. I came close once before. George, you go with her. What about you? I'm going to do a little of the old carrot-on-the-stick trick. I'll lure Federov away from his computer. While he's going, you two shut it down. And that's our plan. That's it. ANNOUNCER: Warning, all systems shutting down. Go. ANNOUNCER: Emergency power activated. Life support integrity will fail in 15 minutes. Pritch, you still there? PRITCH [ON PHONE]: Right here boss. Switch me over to Federov's channel, and follow my lead. He'll know you're there. Yeah, no kidding, Pritch. Just do it. OK. Switching over in ten, nine, eight-- I hope you know what you're doing, JJ. [ON SPEAKER] Captain Hendricks, this is Houston. Come in, Captain. HENDRICKS [ON SPEAKER]: Houston, this is Hendricks. How do I find the power generator and turn this thing back on? PRITCH [ON SPEAKER]: It's in the southwest corner. HENDRICKS [ON SPEAKER]: You sure I'll be able to access it without Federov knowing? Wait for him. As soon as he steps outside, kill him. I will. Turn on the intercom. Hendricks, give yourself up. It's not your fight. It is now. FEDEROV [ON SPEAKER]: You can't stop it. Even if you kill me, they would still launch. Think of the consequences. HENDRICKS [ON SPEAKER]: Why don't you think about the consequences? It's your party. [music playing] ANNOUNCER: Warning, all systems shutting down. Emergency power activated. Life support integrity will fail in 15 minutes. [music playing] [gunfire] Give up, Hendricks. You can't win. It's not about winning or losing, Previ. [gunfire] It's how you play the game. ANNOUNCER: Warning, decompression sequence has been activated. FEDEROV: I hope you have good lungs, Hendricks. It's about to become very difficult to breathe. [groan] [rushing air] [groan] [groan] [rushing air] [airlock] [beep] Any word from Hendricks? No. [machine sound] What? Go. Go. ANNOUNCER: Beginning compression procedure. [slam] Warning, all systems shutting down. Emergency power activated. Life support integrity will fail in 10 minutes. [groan] FEDEROV: Kill me or don't kill me. It does not matter. If I'm dead, you cannot stop the launch. [groan] [scream] [groan] [gunfire] Oh, oh god. Oh. ANNOUNCER: Warning, all systems shutting down. Emergency power activated. Life support integrity will fail in five minutes. - How do I stop the launch? - Oh, god. Don't do this. You can't let this happen. Only Federov. No, I don't believe you. Look at me. Look at me. Millions of people are going to die. I have a son. Please, what about your family? What about your children? Come on. The code. What? - You disable. - What is it? What is it? Come on. 5, 51, point, 3. 30. 351.30. [beep] [airlock] [music playing] [slam] [groan] I'm here to stop the system. Shoot me, Hendricks. I dare you. [beep] Houston, Houston, this is McCord. Come in, Houston. HOUSTON: This is Houston. [groan] MCCORD [ON SPEAKER]: I've got the disable code. I'm putting it in now. [groan] [groan] You should have given up, Hendricks. Maybe next time. [gunfire] ANNOUNCER: Artificial gravity disengaged. [slam] [thud] ANNOUNCER: Artificial gravity engaged. [yell] Six, five, four, three, two, one. [beep] It's working. I disarmed the satellites. All right. MCCORD [ON SPEAKER]: The satellites are disarmed. [groan] You heard it, Federov. It's over. Not yet. [groan] All I have to do is change the codes. Can Federov launch? Not unless he changes the frequency. Amanda, where is Hendricks? I don't know. I'll look, sir. [airlock] JJ? It's over. [gunfire] [crash] You all right? OK, yeah. Where's Tanner? ANNOUNCER: Warning, all systems shutting down. Emergency power activated. Life support integrity. Now what? Now we're going home. Come on. [music playing] How many times have you done this? At least a dozen, in a sim. Safely? I came close once. Close? Real close. All right, Pritch, come in on re-entry, 16 degrees deflection. So far so good. You're looking great, JJ. Getting hot, Pritch. 1900 degrees and climbing. It's only going to get hotter. 2,000, Pritch. It's getting too hot. 2,100 degrees and climbing, Prtich. Hold steady, JJ. 2,200, Pritch. I'm going to have to pull up. You can make it. Trust me. Fly through it. Take the heat. JJ! Do it, JJ. We both know you can. [alarm] One more minute. You sure he can? We'll find out. ANNOUNCER: Catastrophic system failure. [music playing] Hi, baby. Oh, I missed you so much. [tender music] [epic music]
