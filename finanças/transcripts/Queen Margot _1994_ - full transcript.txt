This film was restored by PATHÉ in 2013 10 years now that the Wars of Religion have laid France to waste. The Catholics, lead by the Duke of Guise, fight the Huguenots, lead by Admiral Coligny. A woman rules the kingdom: the Catholic Catherine de Medici. Once Queen, she is now the Regent, governing for her son, the fragile King Charles IX. Favoring the younger brother, Anjou, she tolerates the youngest, Alençon. But it is the beautiful sister Margot she sacrifices for peace in France. Marrying her to the Huguenot Henry of Navarre, she hopes to reconciliate the followers of Guise and Coligny... A union for peace? QUEEN MARGOT - Who's that! - Who are you? I'll kill him! He just wants to sleep. Put it away. To sleep? Well? You'd rather sleep in the street with your Huguenot friends? What? He's Protestant? Dust bothers you? Sleeping with a Catholic bothers me. We are more than you. Better get used to it. There we go. Everybody in the same bed. We're all friends now. Unity is what they want, so set the example. - You came for the wedding? - No. That Margot is an evil whore. The wedding shames us all. Henry de Bourbon, King of Navarre, do you take Marguerite de Valois as your wife? I do. Marguerite de Valois, do you take Henry de Bourbon as your husband? Marguerite, do you take... In the name of God, of the Son, and His Holy Church, I join you in holy matrimony. I give you my sister, and my heart to your Faith. Welcome to the family. It's a peculiar one, but not that bad. Why not tonight? On his wedding night? Precisely. He's a smelly goat. A wild boar! I know it's a bad day for you, but look: My Catholics and my Protestants, together in God's house. Look, this wedding will fix it all. A wedding and a war! That will fix the French. War? Who talks of war today? Look at him! Coligny wants war. Look! The King's against the war. What do you know? The King is Coligny's puppet. Your power is finished. Do not hate me yet. They all hate me. Your brothers, Guise... Your mother dislikes me. Yours hated me. Yours killed mine. There was no proof. Go on, talk, but you're as scared as me. Scared of what? Who hates you, loves me. Then why make you marry me? For peace! I don't have to sleep with you. You saw Margot last night? I was with him. Not all night long. I saw him leave my sister's room. Makes you sad? What do you say? It's her choice. Do not come to my room tonight. Charlotte! I got you some red blush. A gift! Who is this one? Armagnac. He is 26. I heard he's a real fanatic. A bit dark and skinny. Nice smile. And this one? Du Bartas. He came with Henry. He's 19. He lives with his sister! Promising. Nice eyes... But short legs. Short legs? Toss him away! Condé. Royal prince. Which one is he? That one. He's a pervert. All puritans are. He despises me. - And him? - Henry? What does he do? Does he still drink? Laugh? What? What a line to see him. Navarre a haven for us. Freedom of faith down south, the right to bear arms. What can the King guarantee, when Catherine rules? She doesn't rule any more, I do. In 3 days, you lead the army, with me. Will I still be alive in 3 days? Have no fear. I'm not afraid. Why did you marry that scarecrow? It'll never work! You did it with Huguenots? You will tell me? I will stick to Catholics. I stay here! Margot will find comfort in my bed. Don't gloat! I am not going to Poland. You will! Mother will send you out of love and the King out of hate. Doesn't he fear you? Or are you too small and ugly? You leave too, you Amazon. Enjoy Poland! Don't call him names. Look. Catherine wants us to make them talk. It's not easy. Look at them. All in black, like roaches. The tall one's Armagnac. The short one, Du Bartas. - I'll go. - Go on. There you are! They will make you convert. They will. She will! Margot will convert you. Who is she? Charlotte de Sauves. A baroness. She's after you. Baroness? Do you always stare? I fancy you, milord. Can you prove it? You must do the proving. Whenever you want. Choose me over tonight's pleasure. Tonight? What pleasure awaits me? A knife? Poison? Or a slap if God's kind! My room is above yours. It's tonight or never. Tonight, as usual... And in April, Coligny, how many men did you lose? It's not a war! How many Protestants? But it's not a war. What is it then? Answer! This is not a war, it is a crusade! - They were ready to die. - But not to fight. Spain triumphed. Won't you help Flanders? We are willing to help, but... But what? It's Spain! We would be attacking the King of Spain. We are just not ready. Not to fight Europe's greatest army. Attack Spain, and France sides with the Protestant countries. But if Spain wins Flanders, we will be besieged. You mean besieged by Catholics! Nurse! How long to prepare? We are ready. Why did we accept this wedding, if not to bring peace? Peace? You liar! We want peace inside France, so Catholics and Huguenots may fight together outside! - Never! - You have 6,000 men here. Who want to fight! They are hungry. Beware. Beware they do not start a revolt that no one can stop! I want this war. The King wants it too. We will be ready. Come feed the dog, Coligny. White meat is better. Hand me the vegetables. You dominate me. You influence me too much. You always cut me off. You noticed? He's a good eater. They all say so. Everyone... my family, and all the others. But I only see that you have freed me from myself. You see, Coligny, freed of my mother. I am King now she is no longer Queen. Good dog, eat! Mother's not Queen, now that you are my father. I never trusted anyone before you. Only my nurse! She is a Protestant too. So, go over our battle plans. I'll see you in the morning. At 10, as usual. It is to be war? It is war. Who is he? René, Catherine's perfume-maker. And her poison-maker. That is good to know. - No perfume! - You prefer poison? I like you Protestants. You still put your trust in God. And I like you Catholics. Are you really 2,000 here? Go on, count! They are my wedding guests. It's good for France. But for me... your wedding day is a day of mourning! I feel shame. You had my mother killed, and then I marry your whore. In Orléans, 3 years ago, Guise paid you to kill Coligny? How much? 10,000? 15,000? 20,000. I know. A man saved him. One of his old captains, who took the bullet. Who was it? De la Môle. Leyrac de la Môle. You were in his service? You were a son to him. He gave you room and board. You called him father. He was a father to you. And you shot him in the back. They want your head. So? Sell it or else use me. Tomorrow, at 10, a man will walk down St. Germain street, to the Louvre. How do I spot him? He will carry a red portfolio. Like this one. You still have Guise's pistol? I'm better with a rifle. Maurevel! I'd rather you use Guise's pistol. I waited last night. You promised to say goodbye. Why say goodbye? I love you, and I am still here. You belong to him now. He will never be my husband. And you will always be my brothers. Wake up! He's here. He's waiting. Out! The King told me that he isn't the cuckold anymore. You never took my virginity, have my wedding night! Who took your virginity? Who? Your brother? Which one? Take me tonight. You've got a dagger? Isn't he coming? The wild boar... Do I look married? You look uncertain. Unpredictable... Tonight, love me like never before. I want to discover your body, your smell. I want an endless night. I want to see the image of my death in my pleasure. I want my wedding night, but with you. Your husband is coming. He just left his room. You knew he'd come. Don't go! You knew it! I'll make him leave! After... We will have all night. I guess I avoided Catherine's spies. They believe I'm with... the Italian... The pretty baroness. Go on! Go see her. God ordered me to talk to you, and to you only. I have to... Protestants and their God! God... or instinct. - Whose? - The peasant's! Your mother calls me that. If I live, I will be King. My brother is King. The other two will succeed him. And then their children. Your chances are slim. Yours are too. They will not protect you. You are nothing. You are a hostage for your brothers. My brothers love me! They sold you out, - and Catherine... - Mother loves me! She would sell you cheap too! Mother cherishes me! She hates you. And your lover, de Guise... - He uses you... - Stop! For power, and to seduce women. Why? Stop it. Did your God ask you to insult me? Margot, I only came to strike a deal. Will our marriage save me for a month? Days? Help me, today, and tomorrow I will take you to the top. You were not to come tonight, or any other night. That's true... We had agreed. But give me your hand, teach me. Lead me. I'm blind here. These halls lead to an invisible trap. They will kill me. Your brothers will, and you will be in the way. You can rule over them. You can be Queen, Margot! Let go of me. We were forced to marry, let's outplay them. Stop it! Be my ally. Let's strike a deal! Don't be my enemy! Stop it... I am not your enemy. My friend then? My ally? Will you be my ally? Maybe. Now, leave. Leave. Your brother? Your lover? Both? I would love to know. I also had a coat. I dislike him... But I will not betray him. Stay. It's your wedding night, not mine. Henriette! I need a man tonight. Let go of that! Huguenot bastard! That's mine! Give it back! This must be yours. A country-boy? You lost everything? My horse... Some clothes. All my money. It'll be free for you then. Not on the mouth! My father left me a hunting book. I heard René le Florentin might like it. Is it for sale? Because I was robbed. It's for sale. It's a hunting book. About fox hunting, and falconry. Leyrac de la Môle. Is that you? My father. From Roussillon? From Languedoc. Remarkable. Exquisite. 100 gold coins? You saw the wedding? I came to see Admiral Coligny. Coligny? A friend of my father's. Don't you know? He's dead. Someone shot him, just a few minutes ago. Look out! On a Friday. Like our Lord! Make way! Make way! Excuse me! Is that the Admiral? - Is he... - He is only wounded. - What? - I have a letter from my father. Later. I came to go fight in Flanders! Others did too! Murderers! You murderers! You want us dead! Make way for the King! God will punish you! Is that your peace! Make way for the King! Justice will be done! Our brethren will come from all over to avenge us! Speak to them. Do not call for revenge, thank God who looks over you. Your leader is safe. It is only a light wound. I will prove my loyalty, a ship awaits to take you to England. With Coligny gone, you are dead! But he lives! I know what they can do when afraid. - What we can do! - Don't listen! She is a Catholic. She is a spy. Get her out! We are 1,000! Let us gather and fight! Listen... She is warning us! She hates us. Get her out! - She is one of them! - She is Guise's mistress! Whose side would Jesus take if he were here? Jesus would tell your King to leave whatever the risks. - She mocks us! - But not to wait to die in a disaster. I tell you to flee tonight, now! First, they killed your mother. Today they attacked Coligny. You are next. Would you come with me? But... She is one of them! Yes... I am one of them. You cannot be saved. You deserve your fate. They will seek revenge. They are getting ready, in the peasant's room. I know it. I want to know who did it. Didn't you see their hatred? How they cursed us? The Louvre will fall. They will kill you, your brother and sister. They will kill us all. They have been mustering for weeks. I've got weapons! I've got men too! There are thousands of them. Those wedding guests. They will storm us. Coligny is my father. Stop saying that! If your father were alive, he would know what to do. He knew a real King does both good deeds, and bad ones. Guise knows how to attack first. - Me? - They found your pistol. Fine! That's a crime I would have loved to commit. Nobody is blaming you, but why miss! They blame me for Coligny? So what? Go on, open an inquest for Coligny. Listen to Guise. Be a useless King in favor of justice. You will bring ruin to France, while I work to make us strong. Since your father died, it's me who's been doing all the dirty work! And I will not stop. - You? - I would die for my children. You had him shot? Me and only me. He should have died. We have to go all the way now. We must kill the leaders. Tonight. Condé, of course, and D'Aubigné. Teligny, Beauvoix, Mornay, Du Bartas... And Navarre! No! Not Navarre! Coligny! You want Coligny dead? I do too! So, all Protestants must die. There are to be no survivors. None left to come blame me for this. How many must we kill? Eleven. Fourteen. All of them! - How many are we? - Enough. It's done. Write me in. Name? Coconnas... Hannibal. You know what you are volunteering for? I do. And those who help them? May God help those who help them. Any witnesses? The Catholics will not talk. Make it so the others cannot. A lot of people! The King said: "All of them". It has started. Get the weapons! Over there! Let him go! Move! Armagnac! Du Bartas! Henry! Margot! Fight back! Orthon, quick! Hide in the King's room! Go get De Nançay! Go to your room! Lock yourself in! - There's one upstairs. - Quick! This La Môle is a Huguenot. - Why are you telling me that? - Go on! There, in the room. Son of a bitch! Get him! Over there! Come here! - Are you Protestant? - Yes. Of course he is! Convert him! Come on, repeat after me. Credo in Deum... Credo in... Say it! Say it! Jesum-Christum... Look out! Coligny is up there! Kick in the door! There he is! Mine! He's mine! It's done! I curse you! Now for Condé! He managed to cross the Seine. - I'll go. - Why? You must not be seen. The God of War is with me! This is butchery! Go back to the Louvre! There! I am the Queen of Navarre! He is with me! It is God's justice, he must die. God does not want him dead! Kill me first! Why save him? He will die in my arms not yours! You will not get this one! How many did you kill? Only those I had to. On Judgement Day, you will be glad to have spared a life. And that Day may be close by. What will you say to God? What will you say to God? That you finished off the wounded? And killed a Catholic woman to get to the wounded? I've six Catholics with me! And I'll stab you in the heart! So, get out now! Let's go! Blood? Who is it? Nobody! Go on, leave! Don't be coy! Danger turns me on too. Let me see him! Henriette, have these men leave, for God's sake! You beg God when you want a man? And your family talks of Christ and orders a massacre! They did not! I forbid you to judge my family. He is back... He's all cut open. Take me away, I'm ready. I knew you would be beautiful... So luminous! I am ready. Take me away! Cold... your hands are cold. Margot! Open up! They want to kill Henry! She wants him dead. What? They said they want him dead. He didn't come see me tonight. Where is he? In the King's room. Let me through. Is Navarre here? They want him to convert. He's in my room. With them. He won't convert. I didn't do anything. It's not me. You believe me? Why? Why? She did it. I swear she's to blame! You sold Henry out? I brought him here to protect him. They all came later. Come with me. Come on... I'm scared! Calm down... I don't want to go... Calm down... Where were you? And Armagnac? Did they kill him too? What do we do with him? Not Henry! Do not touch him! He is of our blood. We will all be damned! We said all the leaders. Not him! You should have killed him before. It is too late now. You wed us before God. He is my husband, your brother! He will not convert. Let him be! You still won't? - Why? - Stop... It's over now. No Protestants in the family! - Stop! - You understand? Let Margot take care of him. Now I know what hate is. Well learn about hypocrisy too. You must convert. Don't go! What do you want? This one? We must forget tonight's faces. Take them away. "I wish to return to the fold that is the true Church... "the Roman Catholic Church...' "I wish to return to the fold that is the true Church... "the Roman Catholic Church...' "I renounce all Lutheran and Calvinist heresy... "And I beg you in the name of God... "Of His son Jesus, and the holy Virgin... "The most holy Virgin Mary, His mother...' "And I beg you in the name of God...' "I renounce all Lutheran... "and Calvinist heresy... "I beg you in the name of God..." "Of His son Jesus, and the most holy Virgin Mary, His mother...' "To pardon my sins... "Among these sects... "and greet me in the community... "of the Pope.' Look at him! Self-serving, Protestant, Catholic, ambitious... You aren't in love? No. Why are you crying then? Armagnac! They let you live. I too converted. At least we are alive. Bells? No one's left to kill! Condé is. He got away. One more, one less. Who cares? You rule over a Catholic country, now. Be proud. You can be proud! Proud to rule over a country full of dead bodies! Paris is a cemetery! And we are shamed! Stop it! You always worry about your sons. Well, don't any more: because they are damned! And I am too! Why? They were my wedding guests! And you used me as bait for the massacre! Not in public. Your family does not need bait to start a massacre. How many killers did you take along? I finished what the King started. The King saved us. Do not insult him! How many did it take for Coligny? Stop it! Lock her up! Take a message to Condé. I'm a prisoner too. Come on! I wanted peace, Margot. Peace for the kingdom, for my children. You are not to leave the Louvre. You can stay with your husband and your Protestant friends. What's wrong, Margot? Your husband is Catholic, don't become Protestant. Something happened last night? Something else? I will find out. Every night he cries out, vowing to find his killer. I'm the one he seeks. I cannot escape this man. God put him on my road. He always comes after me. And if he does not, I will come to him. Stay put! I must see her! They say you are a faceless devil... People fear you because you are the hangman. Yet you saved my life. Don't get up! They say she cannot love... Stop! That hers is the blood of murderers... Yet she saved my life. I must see her. No one can get near her. Or near her husband. They can't even move around the Louvre freely. It's better like that. God chose me to save her. I will set them free. Look. Here in Amsterdam, they are 2,000 waiting to leave. They would rather face hunger, cold, and the unknown, than pray in the cellar, or pretend to go to mass. Armagnac? Welcome! I could leave too... We must fight! I was in London, Germany... We are gaining ground. The Catholics feel our menace. They fear us! I saw La Rochelle, I got in by the sea. Guise has doubled his men, but our people die rather than convert! Guise fuels my hate. Hope shall rise among our people if we free Navarre. How many men will you need? Mr. Mendès is back. You'll get your money. Only 300. Secrecy counts more than numbers. Last year, Mr. Mendès's family had to flee Spain. I am Jewish. My wife is a Christian. My family converted a long time ago. But the law forbids us to marry Catholics. They want to keep the blood pure. I will give you the money to save the King of Navarre. Even if we are of different faiths. So he converted? She made him? She saved him. And they are both prisoners? Can you believe it? Look. I count seven lumps. Anjou will live? He will be King? 7 times 2 is 14. Anjou will rule after Charles. For 14 years. And Alençon? Will he rule after that? Alençon will not live to be 30. But his son? One of my sons will have a son, right? The liver is to the left: three deaths followed by decay. Death? My 3 sons! Decay? Henry of Navarre... will rule in their place. I thought that horrid night had changed it all. We killed 6,000 of them. But he... he is still alive. And he will rule. Never. Look! The red is so beautiful, so pure. There! The blue is Venice cream, whale fat, oil and violet. It's beautiful! You look gorgeous. It's so precise. The red's pretty. They can even cry! And why would they cry? Quiet! Charlotte, I have a present for you. Come... The red I promised for your lips. For me? At the last moment. It's a powerful aphrodisiac. Thank you. We took over your room. We're getting made up. She is up to something. And Armagnac? Where is he? How about you? Do you know? I don't. Yes you do! I can't take this. Did you hear anything? Thousands have converted. They're not so resolute after all... And him? You need another man. A man to wake your body up, and put your memory to sleep. Forget him. I cannot. You forgot others! She suspects me. She is right: you would do anything. Take it off. The blush? Everything but the blush. The King of Spain likes you. The perfect marriage. I am already married! You never sleep with him. Tonight, he is with her. Everybody knows. Father gave you 10 children, but never left his mistress! He loved me in his own way. We had 10 children... Look at the fruit of his desire: rotten children. You know nothing of love. Love can be a one way feeling. I have known love! All my life I loved one man! I gave him everything, my flesh and my blood. I forgave everything. Even his cheating. What do you know? Why are you the peasant's ally? - You share nothing! - We share your chains. I came to release them. The King of Spain will forgive us... and forget what he has heard about you. Like what? That the whore's bed is perfect for getting France once your sons are all gone? Has he heard your sons are dying? They will have sons. They don't have any! But my husband will! Don't touch her! Don't touch her! Where is he? She's alone. Too bad. Wait! Grab her feet. Open the window. Out she goes. Don't stay here... Go back to bed. Every night I see my people being slaughtered. I hear screams, people yelling murder... Hide your grief. Hide your fear and sorrow. Keep a light heart, pretend you are free. You managed so far, do not stop. Death was on her lips. Death was on her lips! To love someone, is to kill him. It means giving them a hold on you. Never show your love. Margot, no... I promised not to. I did not. He's gone. One day he woke up and asked for you. You were gone, so he left. He's living with a duchess. He's rich. But he's sad. I worry about him. A duchess? I sew as well I as chop heads! A woman from the court? Who knows Margot? Who sees her every day? Wait here. You're alive! Thank God! You saved my life and you're back to punish my sins! I cannot absolve your crimes. Hit me! I beg you to hit me. Get up! Please, hit me. Are you hungry? Are you hungry? You want to eat? Can I cook something? Tomato, basil and fresh onions. It's my turn to feed you. And the Louvre? I'm there all the time. It makes me sick. Can you really get in? They're carrion, all of them! You take me for an idiot? No. You have a letter for Henry of Navarre. But you want to see her! - So help me! - It's too dangerous! - She saved me! - To better ruin you. Maybe... Maybe. Who managed to get you up? You're lucky, I can't anymore. - It's him that she thought dead. - I know. You were eating? You wish to see her? You really do? Every night, I dreamt of a ghost. Every morning, I hoped you were alive. I always knew you would recognize me. Always. You smelt of jasmine, that morning. I thought: maybe she is ugly under her mask? Or defaced. But it didn't matter. You would not let me kiss you. I thought: she is even lonelier than me. She loves as though she is seeking revenge. I tried to forget you, but you came to me on that horrid night. God brought me to you. I opened my eyes in the massacre, and there you were... How many men? Two hundred. They will be in Meaux, waiting for him. When is the hunt? At what time? Monday. They leave at 6. They will be in Pontoise at 9. They will eat at 12, and Henry will try to slip away. Will you be with him? It's a wild boar hunt. Men only! I have tried to get you out for months. Navarre and you, but mainly you. I will leave on my own. I am the King's sister, it will be easy. Where will I meet you? Henry's page, Orthon, will tell you. Enough! Enough! Henry is already a prisoner here, why the Bastille? I want him locked away. In a cell? He'll die. - He'll die... - Listen! Armagnac is back from Holland. He is with Condé, in Meaux. - So? - They are scheming. They got money from England and Holland. Sign. Not now! He's going to teach me to kill wild boar with a dagger. Go hunting, we will arrest him after. Tonight is fine. Sign. They're waiting. I'm late. Maurevel! He's back? Why him? Why not? He is perfect. After the hunt. In sight! In sight! Come on, Henry! What's with him? He's happy when he hunts, for once. Come to Navarre! I cannot leave Charles. Quick! A stake! A stake! Take my pistol! It's no fun with a gun! A stake! Come on! Give me one! Another one! Come on! Look out! Anjou! Alençon! Shoot! Shoot! You all right? I'm fine. Thanks, Henry. My bullet broke her knee. One does one's best. I'm not dead, so you're not King. Not yet. You thought about it though. To Paris! - Paris? Now? - Yes! Come on! Come on, Henry boy! Back to the Louvre? Can you believe it? He saved the King! He betrayed us! We must warn Margot! To hell with her! They will notice she is gone. I will go to the Louvre. I want to see him. Go and get killed! Come along. We're leaving. Leaving? I'll get my coat. Come now. She's waiting for you! Come! She's waiting for you. I thought you were dead. Again. You must go back. Henry saved the King. They turned back, before he could escape. They will see you are gone. You must go back. Come. Marie! Charles! I brought another King. A happy one, with no crown. Come, Henry. Take his hand. Hold it... It's the hand of a brother. Without him our child would be an orphan. I can eat without checking my food here! You won't say anything? Never? She'd kill them! Catherine loves you. Maybe she'd only be jealous. Jealous? She only loves Anjou. She wants to rule with him. To make him King. King of France or Poland. I feel happy here. Does Margot know about...? Nobody knows. If she knew, maybe she'd be jealous too? She's a sister to you, not a wife to me! Would you set Margot free? Come sit with us. I'd rather listen. Would you set Margot free? Today, I can't deny you anything. Then let us go. I will take her to Navarre. Margot? In Navarre? - She'd be bored to death! - I will teach her. I will. Teach her what? To love life. To scream out of sheer happiness, to go swimming in rivers, to cook bread on hot stones, to drink wine, to eat garlic! One must love life, that's all there is in Navarre. Did you two make love? Don't leave me, Henry. You're my only friend. Nobody will harm you, or Margot, as long as I live. If it works, you will go to Navarre with Henry. - You will be safe. - I know. You will be Queen. And you will be my master and my subject. I love you as you are now. Naked, in exile, forgotten by all... No past, no future... No family, no fancy dress to bury love. I am on your side, with the victims. I will not go back to the killers. I will never be your subject. Please, do not ever leave me. They say that Death always takes your lovers. They say you keep the heart of those who loved you in gold boxes all around your bed. They say that? And what else? That, at night, my face masked, I wander through the city looking for love? Swear that if I die... you will keep the head the hangman will sever from my body and you will sometimes put your lips to it. Swear. Swear to me. I swear. God's hand is on this man. Quick! Come kiss me, my son. You were brave yesterday. Your hand saved my son. I thank you. Come. There she is. The Protestants believe you betrayed them. They cannot understand. What is betrayal... but one's skill in following the flow of events? You have made great progress. I am learning from you. Where were you last night? Do you know? I gave my word. Anjou is leaving. My heart bleeds. I love my three children. I mean, all four of them... Why come back? Was he not good enough? I came back for you! La Môle would die to free us. - Us? - He would die for us! He would die for another night with you. He is of no use to me. You have no right to be jealous! No demands. You promised... You were not my wife then. I stink. I smell bad. Your brother stopped me from entering, last night. I saved his life, so he adores me. Have you gone mad? Do you not care who they killed? Your blood will soon be on the wall! You must go, flee as soon as you can! Charles trusts me. You did it for a reason. He knows it! I saved him. And he saved me. To leave would be betrayal. To stay is betrayal! To hear you say that is shocking. It sounds so real. You betrayed your faith, now your friends! You grovel at Charles' feet. Last night he was different. He always is! I know him so well... I love him! It's bath day. I'm going. You once asked me to be your ally. So I guided and protected you. Now, it is my turn to ask. Let Navarre be a haven for me. Take me to Navarre. Take me with him. Whom do you wish to rule over? Navarre, your lover, or me? I only slept with you so people would know! You have no right over me. They are inseparable. They are out hunting again. Just the two of them. It stinks! What is it? The King has sold, yes, sold, your brother to the Poles. Do you know what he said? "What if we sent the kid...' "so Henry can stay with me?' Do you know why he wants Henry here? So Margot will stay. One day, he will get rid of me. Hands off! You are 17 now. Can you keep a secret? Margot will soon be a widow. This is a book on falconry. Perfect for learning about falconry. Who likes falconry? Put it in Henry's room. It is such a rare book, so scarce. It has been closed for so long that the pages are stuck. One must wet one's finger, page after page, to turn them. My sword! Look, the brat! Quiet, Actéon! You're white as a sheet. You are reading? It's stunning. The best hunting book ever written. Look: La Môle. Do you know the name? Are you listening? He's Margot's lover. A man of taste. Both in women and books. I must meet him. How come the pages are stuck? Every day I will send a messenger. You will know everything. About the family, France... Every day, until I call you back for good. I will have a horse saddled day and night. I will pretend to be their King. But my heart will be here... with you. To the King of Poland! Now we're all Kings! Anjou in Poland, me here... You, in Navarre! You want Navarre? It's yours! Right? Nature, wine, garlic... And hunting! It was my emotions... Emotions! You kill the horseman instead of the horse. Damned emotions. God can do so much with so little. How was war? How was the countryside? Your eyes are bulging. The cuckold's horns are pushing out? Like this! It bothers you. It's eating you up. La Môle! A courier, a conspirer... A pure heart, mind you. But he does screw your wife. Does Henriette watch? I hear she loves to. - A slut at heart! - Stop it. You know La Môle? A survivor! Margot saved him that night. Right, Margot? Stay. - Never in... - ...public! They made a deal. You're mad, Margot! The husband remains blind and the wife mute. My farewell party makes them sad. What's this? What's that scar? On your shoulder. Marks! Look! Teeth marks. Was it you? Charles, you bit her! A long time ago... Show them! Show them my mark! Show it! She cut herself, and we rubbed dirt in it. It all closed up. It's on her thigh, up here. Show them! Tell us about La Môle. He teaches me pleasure! Tell us! He is a magical lover. He is a prince. And you're a dog in woman's jewelry! Barren slut! Lucky you can't bear his bastard! I'm burning! My throat! My belly! You're in Poland yet. I'm all right... It's over. I'm better. Ambassador, he is all yours. Actéon! The poison ate up the bowels. It's a mineral poison. Are you sure? As though I made it myself. It's arsenic. A slow poison. What would a man feel? Headaches, burning throat and stomach. Then it would stop. As though it were over. Then pure fire... until death. Quick death? No. But a sure one. Recognize the book? You poisoned Henry's mother's gloves! And Charlotte's blush! I'll have you burnt to bits. Whose book is it? Queen Catherine's. She wanted... Navarre to read it. It hurts! I'm on fire! Your Protestant rabble, Condé and all... They're waiting for you. Waiting for me? La Môle's there. Go on. Go rule over Navarre. - Me dead, they'll kill you. - Margot? - She's ours. - She is my wife. - She is ours! - You promised. You promised! I never promised. She will never go. Leave! Go straight through the marsh. They're waiting! Get out! It's blood. He's sweating blood. Leave... I'll get the doctor. Get out. Get out! Leave! I am staying. I am your mother. You may give life, but you are no longer a mother once you take that life back. Too much reading. Do you understand? It was not meant for you, I swear. It was for the peasant. He wants you dead. He wants all my children dead! If he lives, it means the end of our family! The end of my beloved sons! You only love one of them. That's not true. Burn it. "La Môle.' Margot tried to leave with that man. Margot will never leave. Burn the book. Burn it! What about him? Where is he? With Henry's Protestants. Without Margot? He left without her? He won't be back, and Margot will forget him. But if he returns? He deserves to die. What for? For screwing Margot? For poisoning the King! I was weak, but my ordeals enlightened me... You were weak, but we are proud of you. Prince Henry, welcome back to our Faith! God greets you back! He will help you conquer France! I am cleansed of all evil and rot! I obeyed that family to save my life! Forgive me! I was a coward! But now I am myself once again! My life and my courage are yours! Together, we shall make God's love triumph! I will not abandon Margot. - You have! - I will not leave her. She is Catholic! She's not with us. It's over! She never betrayed me. Can you say the same? She never loved me. You cannot go back. Send someone for her. You go fetch her. Orthon can help. But they will fight for her. Tell Margot that Navarre will forever be a haven for her. And for those she loves. Where is Orthon? He's coming with Margot. And Henriette's coming too. Look out! You innocent victim of duty. You will die. Fight, Coconnas! For each one you kill, a sin shall be forgiven! God's watching you! Stop! You saved him once, that's enough! They're off to the Bastille! Get up! Get up! Go to the King! Speak to him! I don't want to lose him. That's my favorite dress. Charles! I love him... Where were you? I love him. For days now, you've been hiding in your room. You didn't want to see me? I have changed... You still love me? It's blood. It doesn't matter. Keep on smiling, Margot! Remember... hiding one's grief is an honor to the dead. They're not dead. I am dead! I'd have been sad to die without you. You won't die! I will stay with you. He did nothing but help me and love me. That is no crime! Please let him go. No, that's no crime. Let me have him. Set him free! To my room... Only Margot! He cannot be set free for reasons of State. Because of the other crime. What other crime? - Which one? - No one must know. I have been poisoned. Anjou must not come back. They will kill you, mother and him, they will. Go fetch Navarre. He must rule! What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm smelling my own death. How will I answer God's questions? I will say: "On the night of the St. Bartholomew? "I slept like a log!" I didn't even hate them! You know that, nurse! I know you never hated them. You drank the Protestant faith in my milk. My sweet baby lamb. They are waiting. They are all waiting for me. They're sweating blood, like me. You had a secret love too... Pardon La Môle! He poisoned me. He did not! But we must say he did. Why? Who did it? Mommy... Oh my God! Protect him. My God, protect him. Let me carry him! Is she here? - Can you see her? - Yes. Lift me up so I can see her. In the window, over there. In her blue dress. - Where? - She's crying. Where is she? Henriette's there too. Hug me! Hug me! I see a light. I see Our Lord Jesus, and the Virgin Mary. They are begging Our Father to forgive me. They keep on waking him up. You too must forgive. Sign... Sign La Môle's pardon. What time is it? Five o'clock. It's too late then. Too late? Too late... Marie... I loved you so! Margot... Lord... Lord! I come to Thee without crown or scepter. Forget the crimes of the King and remember only Your child's sufferings... My conqueror! You are back! We shall do great things. I only wish to please God. We shall stop the war. We shall stop all hatred. We shall be gentle yet strong... King Charles IX is dead! Long live King Henry III! It is a mixture used for embalming the Kings. Preserve his beauty. Remove my jewelry. Bury them together. You can come. I'll stay. Let's go! Navarre awaits you... Blood's dripping on your dress. It does not matter. As long as I keep on smiling...
