She's still traumatized. She'll find refuge in our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. She's practicing divine elimination. Do not mortals have heart service on earth? Are not their days like those of hired laborers? Like a slave longing for the evening shadows or a hired laborer waiting to be paid? So I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me. My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering. Dalia, that's enough reading of the holy book for tonight. The poor child has been through a lot. She was lucky to make it out of that place alive. In this report, we examine the Golden Path movement. The Cult has recently grown in strength, with reports of hundreds of followers living at their compound property. The cult's leader is an Eastern European immigrant who calls herself RAGANA. RAGANA, she's our true leader. She's a very powerful deity. In Lithuanian the words ragas menulio, the moon's horn, they describe our lady's relationship to the moon. According to reports, RAGANA fled her Baltic homeland in order to escape religious persecution. We practice an elemental form of paganism. We feel that the human race has lost its connection to the mother earth. Ragana's disciples believe she is a powerful witch, who is the reincarnation of an ancient Baltic goddess of death and regeneration. Local authorities have stated that they will maintain surveillance over the Golden Path compound property. Another ceremony tomorrow. I'm scared. Just go to sleep Marija, we've all got to get some rest. You know we won't sleep for three days once the ritual begins. But what happens if you two are chosen? I'll be left all by myself. Don't worry Marija. We'll always stay together, I'll make sure of that. No matter what happens, I'll come looking for you both. I swear. The Golden Path child has now become a woman. She will not rest until she finds her missing sisters. Her heart is full of sorrow and her mind is unsettled. She tells herself, when I know the truth, be it life or death, then I least I will be free. Come. Come my child. Come forth into the wisdom of the dark. The light has trapped you in its secrets for too long. Come. Come to me. This place is hell to me! The devil in this bottle, I'm hungry! And the devil in my head. Let's drink to the future, my friend. They're here! Yeah, sorry we're late folks, just another religious extremist attack downtown. Had to go the long way around. Yeah come on. I'm starving, Mr. Yeah get some of this tucker boys! Everything sorted, Dalia? All good, Johnny. Could I grab a piece of bread? Yeah mate, tuck in. Cheers mate. Thanks folks. You're welcome. You don't need to use your manners around me guys, you know. You alright? Then that one's for me then. Cheers bud. Let's drink to the future, my friends. I'm living on borrowed time. What about the scooter? And the devil don't mind. Shut up. Hey, thanks for your help today, Dalia. It's hard to find good people these days, everyone's always in it for themselves. No one gives a fuck anymore. Well, it's the least I can do. I mean, these people need our help and the Catholic Services got me the position as soon as I left the orphanage. Catholic Services? Oh, what a joke! Yeah, well, I'm glad to be out of that place. They tried to make me act like them and talk like them, but at the end of it, I'm just me. Yeah, you're an angel Dalia I don't know about that, Johnny. Oi. Leave that, I'll fix that. You get going. You sure? Yeah, yeah. Alright well, see you next week. Oh well. Come here. Thanks. Oi. Stay safe, yeah? We have long suffered through ignorance, lust and greed. The world's churches battle around us, and innocent people die. The Earth's resources are drying up and soon there will be more wars. The apocalypse is at hand. We must return to the natural ways. We will rise from the ashes and rule the earth. Who has not seen the gates of the dead? The saviors will come, one after the other, as they are needed, to achieve the ultimate goal. You know the law. No man talks directly to the holy mother. You are violating my brood. But we must do what we can to survive. Go on, start the preparations for another ceremony. Sleepwalk, children, into the valley of death. I scarith thee with dreams and terrify thee with visions. Are you okay? The path will give me strength. The path will give me strength. But courage, my brood. I guide you down the Golden Path. I guide you to eternity. No, no, no, no! Joe, Joe, come on. Joe. Through their abrasive sound, chaotic live show and well-publicized criminal convictions, SORAT have spread their message of fear and hate across the world. At the center of this storm of controversy is lead singer Moloch. Some say the most despised man in Europe. Moloch was charged with church arson and torture-like violence and sentenced to prison. It was his second incarceration for violent acts. Exiled from his country after numerous death threats, I have traveled to a secret forest location, to interview who many refer to the most evil man alive. I'm standing here outside Moloch's secret bunker deep in the woods. We are the first journalists to have ventured out here. I'm quite honored to be interviewing the man himself, but to be honest I am also a little nervous. Christianity is based on nothing but lies and false promises. Every trace of it must be destroyed. Our goal is to spread the word of Satan. SORAT spread fear, and I use that fear to get my ideas across. Tom, Tom, the piper's son, stole a pig and away he run. The pig was eat and Tom was beat. And Tom went roaring down the street. Tom is Touum, the god of the sunset. The pig refers to the evening sacrifice, and some say that it is Hathor, the lady of the West. This verse is likely does not standalone; it is part of a long forgotten epic. But this stanza says too much and too little to just be on its own. How to solve the mystery of the pig and who ate it? To be chosen to share the love of god is a great honor. Together we will build an army of beautiful maidens. Holy Mother! Young Dalia. Yes Auntie? Your time to become the chosen one is close. Yes Auntie, that is the duty of all maidens. But things are not really as they seem. Terrible things happen to the girls that are taken away. You must escape, you must leave tonight. You're lying. I can't leave this place, this is our home. Ssh! I won't leave my sisters! The disciples may be stained with filth and inequity, but the essence of the Golden Path remains always pure. But to dwell in the mortal world, even with the aim of supplanting it, one must have the means. The selling of sin yields much treasure. Depravity buys holiness. Why are you following me? The tattoo on your wrist. You're one of those girls aren't you? I remember seeing it on the news. That one was one majorly fucked up operation. This way. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Move, move, move. Move, move. Prepare to fire. My brood, how can you escape me? No, RAGANA, no! Quick, run! Come here, girls. No. Dalia! I'll find you, I promise I will. Dalia! Hold your fire, there's kids in there. Let's go. Move, move, move. This way, into the building. Oh, my God! Get those kids out now! Easy. You need medical attention. No, keep driving. It is my fate. I do hope you can take good care of her. We'll teach her the ways of Christ. She'll learn to speak like us, in our holy tongue. She'll find refuge in our Lord Jesus Christ. You haven't exactly moved on, have you? I made a vow with my sisters to never leave them, so, I have to find out what's happened to them. Why don't you just go to the cops? No way. They just make things worse. I don't trust them and they think I'm mad anyway. So what are you gonna do? I need to find Moloch. He knows something. Hey, don't get me wrong, I love my black metal and all, but he's one scary guy. We have to go there. I know you wanna go, but it's not gonna be easy. I'm leaving in the morning. Okay. I'll take you. You can sleep over there. Are you okay? The Golden Path, they always haunt my dreams. And not just my dreams. You do realize it's a three to four hour trek through this forest. I say we rest up for the night and continue on in the morning. No. I need to find Moloch. I need to find out what's happened to my sisters. They've been in trouble. But it's gonna be dark soon. I mean, how are we gonna see where we're going? I said we need to keep moving. Okay. I thought you said you knew the way? Marija! They've been in trouble. How far are we? Why does he live out here anyway? Well, Black Metal has a deep connection with nature. You know, the wild and harsh wilderness, forests, mountains, winter storms, blizzards. See, Moloch grew up in extreme isolation, he doesn't need the company of other humans. He never has, and I guess he never will. Another glorious day in great outdoors. I've been expecting you. How did you know we were coming? A raven told me. I was told by the label guys that a heroic black metal fan would be escorting a young, vicious lady out here. They also told me you're interested in my prison time and the company I was forced to keep. Right? I've always wanted to meet you. I'm Sam. It's a pleasure to meet you, young lady. It's a rare treat to see such a beautiful maiden in these harsh woods. You poor girl. I can feel the pain of your past. You must let it go and move forward. Please come inside. Please, sit down. Would you like some wine? Yeah. To be in control, you must know your tools. The Magic Cup has the understanding of the magician. This cup is full of bitterness, of alcohol, of intoxication. Thought is the blood of the mind. All thoughts must be offered up as sacrifice. Only the simple can withstand the sword. This weapon is entirely destructive; it divides Satan against Satan. Please, I have to know what's happened to my sisters? Please tell me why were they taken away by that witch. Mmm. Then let's start from the beginning and try to solve the riddle of the lost sheep. The sheep represents the flock. We represent the God. The individual struggling against the followers. Our purpose is to burn every trace of Christianity. We demand revenge from the Christian armies who attacked us a thousand years ago, killing our folk and destroying our sacred ways. Eventually I was sentenced to jail. They were both members of the Golden Path. They were convicted of murder, drug trafficking and prostitution. They were talkers. Used to shoot meth. Couldn't keep their mouth shut. Told me the full story of the Golden Path and of a small group that escaped the raid with RAGANA. Your sisters were a part of that group. My death will no more be an absolute end, than my birth a new beginning. After her death, the remaining cult members moved back to Europe, the motherland. The Golden Path followers live with hope that RAGANA will be resurrected one day. That an apocalypse will signal their life back. The girls were moved about like sheep. The Golden Path traded in flesh and existed only in shadows. But in the ecstasy of a ritual, the girls managed to escape. Finally they were free. But is the prisoner ever truly free? Revenge beckoned from their darkened minds. Too much wine, boy? Yeah, excuse me for a second. Why don't you go outside? Sit. Don't you want to hear more about your sisters? Don't you want to hear more about your sisters? The Golden Path knew that no ever truly escapes. Marija traveled to Germany, her newfound freedom brought little relief. All she could focus on was finding her former captors to exact revenge. My brood, how can you escape me? I'll find you, I promise I will. As the Golden Path grew thin with new recruits, the members resorted to kidnapping girls off the streets. The Golden Path had long been involved in the trade of female flesh. I knew she was in trouble. I couldn't help her. It is time to be at one with nature. I couldn't help her. I couldn't help her. I couldn't help her. Let's go. I couldn't help her. Who are you? You should be asking yourself, Sam. Who are you? What? What do you mean? You cannot hide from the truth, Sam. Your self-hate makes you who you are. Where's Sam? He has found what he wants. I can't believe I let them go. I promised I'd look after them. It's not your fault. There is nothing you could do. Come here. She's at peace now. Repeat after me. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. There is hope. Your other sister, she showed the courage of a leader. She survived. She has become a powerful woman. Laima? Laima is alive. Yes. Much to the disgust of my cellmates, she's the reason they were caught. Clever girl, that one. Laima traveled back to Lithuania; the last European country to be converted to Christianity. The pagan beliefs were still very strong there. This was the birthplace of RAGANA. The Golden Path were active there. The cult had set up underground clubs where the girls were kept. Laima knew that all she had to do was to find a working girl that could gain her entry into the secret club. The Golden Path were in search of girls that were pure blood. These girls still followed the pagan beliefs and were not corrupted by Christianity. If they were young mothers they were considered to be even more powerful for use in rituals. We survived. She got her revenge. We are no longer sheep. It was part of the plan. In order to complete your rebirth, we must destroy all traces of our former selves. As a sign of cleansing we must remove all our clothes and offer our body to the sacred winds. To cleanse my past in the winds of death and change. Go my child. Go. You stay away from her. It's too late. She now has the knowledge. Knowledge is the power. She is close now. Are you okay? Yeah, but Marija is dead and Laima got her revenge. The girl got freed and reunited with her daughter. We're free. They can't touch us anymore. No, Sam! She's coming. Sam, where are you? Sleepwalk, children, into the valley of death. I scareth thee with dreams and terrify thee with visions. Sam! You are now the holy mother. What are you talking about? You helped me once. But that was too late. Are you okay? The path will give me strength. The path will give me strength. Flesh is weak, but spirit is invincible. RAGANA can never die. In you she lives. And so will she live after you're gone. ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA ♪ RAGANA
