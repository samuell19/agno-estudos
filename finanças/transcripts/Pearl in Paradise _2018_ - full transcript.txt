- Okay ladies, this is the spot. - Thanks, Charlie. This is so exciting. I can't believe I'm actually doing this. - Like a 400 year old shipwreck. - A 400 year old Spanish shipwreck that's never been seen and never been photographed. Do you think there's gold down there or is that just an old legend? Please tell me I didn't forget my extra battery. Hey Alex, what do you think dad would say if he knew I finally got my dive certification? I think he'd be really happy. - Hey Charlie? - Yo. - What is the visibility? - At least 80 feet. That's what I like to hear. These photos are going to be perfect. This is so exciting, my first big dive. I know and I'm glad we're doing this together. Yeah, it makes me way less nervous. Don't be nervous, you just stick with me, okay? You're gonna do great. You're gonna love it down there. Okay girls, here we go. You ready? These are gorgeous, Alex. - The composition, perfect. - Thank you. - The sense of detail, exquisite. - Thank you. The lighting's like a painting. I don't know what else to say, Sharon. - It is some of my best work. - But they're two days late. I know, but I just wanted the photos to be perfect. I had to use Ben's Swiss orchard shots. - What? - And you know I didn't want to use Ben's Swiss orchard shots. Do you know what your problem is? No, but I'm sure you're gonna tell me. You're too much of a perfectionist. I happen to think that perfectionism is an admirable quality. What did I say last week? You said that this shoot could be my ticket to the Creative Director position. That's right. You have a lot of great ideas about the types of stories we should do. And I know you're dying for more creative control. But how can I trust you to put an issue together when you miss your own deadlines? Do you know what this is? A list of all the deadlines I've missed? Funny. It's Ben Watson's resume. He wants to be Creative Director, too. Ben Watson? Oh come on, Sharon, you even told me I had a better eye than Ben. And plus, most of his photos don't even make it to the magazine. Except for those apple tree shots. Do you know what he has, that you don't? Organization and discipline. - Sharon, the meeting's starting. - I'll be right there. Now if you'll excuse me. The cover story for our 30th anniversary issue fell through and I have to figure something out fast. I'm thinking 30 of the best scenic views or something like that. I don't know, it'll come to me. There, look how organized I am. Pearls. Legend of the Blue Polynesian Pearl. Hey Alex. Ben, hey. Congratulations on your shots making the cover. - Thanks. - Yeah, it was great. Can I help you? Just like I'm busy here. Did Sharon tell you the idea I pitched for the anniversary issue? Nope. - Chan Dan Ya. - What's that? It's a cliff in China that spits out a stone egg once every 30 years. Perfect for the 30th anniversary, don't you think? Hello? That's my sister. Yeah, how are you? Renee, I... Tourists began flocking to Fiji to find the pearl after the release of the bestselling book Pearl in Paradise. Although it has never been found, locals believe the rare pearl is buried somewhere in the rainforests of Viti Levu. When's the next book coming out, Colin? If you don't mind me asking. Why thank you, Molly. You know I just turned in the final draft to the editor, so with editor notes and all that, mid, probably February. - Did you decide on a title? - I did. Treasures in Taipei, but don't tell anybody. Blake Montoya goes to Asia, huh? Cool. You've probably been there a million times anyway. Usual raspberry scone and jam? Yeah, you know what, I'm gonna wait though until my agent gets here. She should be here any minute. Thank you, Molly. Colin Page, nice to meet you. - Who are you? - Rita didn't tell you? I'm Derek Foster and I'm gonna be working closely with you from now on. Rita's been my agent for 10 years and now I'm getting passed off to a junior agent? No, she'll remained involved. It'll just allow her to focus on a few clients that need more attention right now. Trust me, though, you're in good hands. Sir, what can I get you? What are you drinking? It's an organic Ceylon tea from Sri Lanka. He brings his own. Just a regular coffee, two Splendas. I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm a really big fan. - Really? - Yeah. You've got a couple really remarkable successes. Pearl in Paradise sold 23,000 copies in its first week. It's impressive. Impressive for eight years ago. Okay, eight years ago you were in high school. I'm wise beyond my years. Let's talk facts, you're last three books have tapered off dramatically. I wouldn't say dramatically. The sales report, the last two barely sold enough to stay on the shelves. Online was even worse. Diamonds in Dubai made 2,000 downloads. What's going on C. P.? Talk to me. What are you my therapist now? Look, I read your manuscript for Treasures in Taipei. And I can see why the publisher's rejecting it. What, they rejected it? Editor thought it was a greatest hits of all your old stuff. Same ole, same ole. She wants new. She wants fresh and I agree with her. You really, really played it safe. I have never had a manuscript rejected from Rita. Just rewrite it. Get rid of Blake Montoya and create a new character - with higher stakes. - No, I can't get rid of him. Blake Montoya, the fans like Blake Montoya. They love Blake, they're not just gonna spend pages learning a new char... I'm calling Rita. Now look, Rita brought me in to help you find a new approach. We have to reinvent you as an author. If you trust me, I can help you make a comeback. - And if I don't? - The publisher is gonna drop you. - And Rita will, too. - Oh boy. Sharon, check this out. What is the traditional 30th wedding anniversary gift? Is this a rhetorical question or do you actually want me to guess? Pearls. Pearls, for the cover of the anniversary issue. So there is this rare blue pearl buried somewhere in Fiji and I'm gonna be the one to find it and I'm gonna photograph the entire thing. - And how are you gonna do that? - Glad you asked. So there's this guy named Colin Page and he wrote a romance-adventure book about eight years ago. International best seller. Pearl in Paradise. - Yes. - I love that book. Okay, so in the forward, he claims to be the only person who knows where this pearl is. Fantastic idea, Alex. You take the photos, he'll handle the writing. Call this guy's agent and find out how soon he can leave. - No, no, no, no. - Problem? Well, I was just gonna call him and interview him and then I was gonna go on my own. He's a best selling author. Can you imagine the guest piece he'll come up with? But I sort of imagined this first person photographic narrative of my journey through the rainforest, which would parallel my emotional journey. I'll take the photos and he can do the writing. Great idea, glad you thought of it. - Have you read the book? - Yeah, yeah. You should read the book. Yeah. Hey Sharon, look I know... I know I really messed up, but if I can prove to you that I am disciplined and organized enough to pull this off, will you give me the Creative Director position? - You'd certainly have an edge. - Is that a yes? - An edge. - I'll take it. I'm not going to Fiji. Well no, I'm busy. I don't have six days to traipse around a rainforest looking for a pearl. I know you're a homebody, but National Discoveries has 2.5 million readers. That's 2.5 million people who will remember what a talented writer you are. That's 2.5 million additional people to buy Taipei when it comes out. - It's a bad idea. - No, it's a good idea. You know where the pearl is, now go get it. Wait, no, you didn't lie about the pearl being real, did you? No, no, no. I mean I have never seen it, but I'm sure that it exists. And you know where it's buried? Well see, I might have oversold that part, just a little bit. Can you find it on Google Maps? Look, can we please just pass on this article idea? - Listen to me, C. P. - Please don't call me that. I told you it doesn't matter how fantastic the rewrite is if no one buys it. This article is the thing we need to save your career. I'll forward your boarding pass, you leave tomorrow. Hello? Fiji. Are you sure you're okay apartment sitting for me for like the millionth time? Of course. Hey, have you, have you seen my Merino socks? I have no idea what you just asked me. Found 'em. Okay, so legend has it that the pearl comes from a clam instead of an oyster, which makes it more rare. - Yeah, I know. - How are you gonna find it? A few good maps, an expert guide, maybe a little faith. And what will you do with it? I think I would just donate it to a museum in Fiji. Yeah, I think people need to see it. Plus, it's not about the money, I just want the promotion. I don't understand why you want to be Creative Director so bad. You're gonna be home a lot more, not traveling as much, managing staff. I know. I know, Renee, but I just, I wanna inspire people to go on adventures. You know, go see the world. Experience it, try new things. Exactly how dad inspired me, you know? Yeah, yeah I do. So wait, are you saying that your globetrotting days are behind you and you're ready to settle down? - No. - Okay, so listen to this. If a couple finds this pearl together, it's true love and they're destined to be married. So who's this guy you're meeting up with again? Stop it. I know what you're doing. Here, this is his book. A Blake Montoya Adventure. Okay, so if this guy claims to be the only one who knows where the pearl is, why didn't he bring it back with him? I don't know. I'm gonna ask him though. Maybe he did. Maybe he just didn't tell anyone. Well all I do know is that all of my research about the pearl leads me back to this writer, so apparently he's the expert. Done, ta-da. So it's 16 hours ahead in Fiji, which makes it 9:30 in the morning, yeah. She should be awake. - Hello? - Hey Serita, hi. It's Colin Page, do you... Colin, it's so nice to hear your voice again. - How's New York? - Well, New York is New York. - How's Fiji? - Beautiful as always. Well, do you remember all those conversations we had when you trying to get me to come to Fiji while I was researching my book? How could I forget? And do you remember that you said if I were to come to Fiji that you would show me your great grandfather's journal? I'm hoping it might provide some clues as to where the pearl might be. Let me guess. You're coming to Fiji. Yes I am. Wonderful, I can finally put a face to the voice. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. Me too. Excuse me, sir, I think this is mine. Sorry, I think it's mine, it matches my set. - Yeah, no, I'm 100% sure. - Are you sure? I've got my name on it. It has a tag. So do I. It's a tag with my name on it, too. No tag. All right, well why don't you just open it up. I'm sure those fall off all the time. - Right here? - Yeah, where else? I still don't have time. Yeah, here it is, there's mine. That's my name. Okay. All right. Fiji. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention. Taxi. Hi. All right, hang on. Well, hi. Thank you. Okay. Taxi. Hi, welcome. Thank you. That would never happen. You're all checked in, Miss Anderson. - Thank you. - You're most welcome. Anything else? Could you tell me if Colin Page has checked in yet? - I'll check. - Thank you. - Not yet. - Okay, can I leave him a note? Colin, I can't wait to start this adventure with you. Let's meet in the lobby tomorrow at eight for breakfast. Alex. The party's just getting started, DJ Isikeli is going to keep you moving, Fiji style. All right. So much for writing. Bartender. Surprise me. Okay, hi, excuse me. Excuse me, is this noise, is it gonna be this loud all day? Hey you. I see you finally found your bag. I was right, wasn't I? - It was mine. - Sorry. Yeah, and also for the record you happened to take my cab, - but that is neither here nor there. - What? What are you talking about? What is that? I have no idea, but it's really good. - You want one? - No, no, no, I'm a tea, I don't know. I'm a tea drinker. - You're what? - Tea, I drink tea. Tea? In this climate? Oh no, any climate. Yeah, no, it's... Anyway I gotta get back to my room and get some work done before I head out tomorrow morning on this ridiculous thing. Back up to your room? Come on, you're in the middle of paradise here. Bartender, can you get him one of these? Okay, twist my arm. Yeah, just slow down. So tell me about this ridiculous thing you gotta do tomorrow. Okay, yeah. So I'm a writer and eight years ago I wrote a book called Pearl in Paradise and so tomorrow I'm heading out on a trekking adventure through the rainforest with a photographer that I've never met to help her write an article for a magazine I don't read. Thank you. You're Colin Page. Yeah, I am. - Have you read my book? - Yes. Yeah, I actually just got through reading it about five minutes ago. That's a coincidence. What'd you think? - Well I just couldn't put it down. - Thank you, I appreciate that. - And you are? - I'm Alex Anderson. Photographer. - National Discoveries. - National Discoveries. Magazine. Yeah. Or you can just call me your ridiculous thing partner. That... Yeah. Okay, hold on a second. Let's try this again, shall we? Are you Alex Anderson, the famous photographer from National Discovery Magazine? - Because I'm a huge fan. - You are? - Yes, I am actually. - Are you really? No, honestly I am. When I found out we were doing this article together, I went online and I looked at the last 10 issues of your work and I think you're very talented. Well thank you. Yeah, I mean I don't know anything about photography. Did you actually read my book? - Yes, I did. - Yeah? But what'd you think? I thought that Blake Montoya was a phenomenal character. - Yeah? - Yeah, he's attractive and smart and he always knows what to say. I mean he's basically like the perfect guy. I can understand how women all over the world love this book. For me, some of the technical details didn't ring true, but that's... - Which ones? - Do you have all day? - Are you? - I'm joking. I'm joking. How do you know where the pearl is? Now that is confidential. I can't reveal my sources. - What? - Yeah. - You're not gonna tell me? - No, I'm gonna show you. Okay, all right, I can respect that. Well can you at least tell me what it looks like? I don't know what it looks like. - What? - No, I've never seen it. I don't know how big it is. I don't know what color it is. I made all that up for my book. Okay, but why didn't you just dig it up the first time you went to Fiji? Well, that's the thing Alex, I've never even been to Fiji before. You've never been here? Are you serious? Nope, I wrote Pearl of Paradise entirely from my home office in Saratoga Springs. Okay, so let me get this straight. So you never been to Fiji, yet you know where this pearl is buried? That's, yes, that's what I'm saying. And I have my sources. Yeah, yeah, your confidential sources, right? - Yeah. - Okay. You know for someone who's never been to Fiji, your description's like spot on. Exhaustive research, all my books are like that. Well wouldn't you rather go see a place in person, you know like feel the energy? I can get all that in a library. Library? Come on, you look. You can't get, you can't get this from a library. Okay, if I do my job well, then the reader can stay in the comfort of their own home and they can travel the world using their imagination. And if I do my job well, then I can inspire people to go and see the places that I take photos of. - Fair enough. - Yeah. You know I remember the first time I ever took a photo. You do? Yep, I was in middle school and I went hiking to these foothills with my dad. He was a big hiker. And the sun was setting and we stopped, the light was just perfect, but then I took a picture and I brought it back to school with me and there was this boy at school who was so inspired by my little photo that he took his dad to see these very same foothills. And I think that was actually the first time he ever went hiking with his dad. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah, it was cool. That's the moment, that's when I knew this is what I wanna do for the rest of my life. That was it. You know I think with my photos and your writing, - this article is gonna be really good. - Here's hoping. - It is. - Yeah. Now I'm just right up here, so... Okay, well do you still wanna meet tomorrow morning at eight? Yeah, eight's fine. - I might be 8:15. - I'll wait. - Thank you, Alex. - Bye. Ben Watson already turned in his article on the cliff in China? Yesterday afternoon, fascinating. Now the only reason I'm telling you this is because I need something really great from you on time. Okay, I promise you'll get that. Hold on. - Hey, can I call you right back? - Okay. Thanks. - Hello? - Hi, Alex, it's Colin. What exactly do you pack for a three day hike? Yeah, well did you bring your entire closet? Well you know I wanted to be prepared. Yeah, but it's only prepared if you bring the right things. Okay, well. No, denim retains moisture. These are rated five star online. These are zero stars for the rainforest. There's no waterproof lining here, no tread. I mean these are great if you wanna walk through a parking lot. No. - They're sunglasses, Alex. - They're not polarized. You're not gonna be able to see. This sounds like a lovely experience. You know what this can be a lovely experience if you have the right clothing and the right attitude you might actually have fun. And then we can both be little Blake Montoya's. Right? - Come on, let's go shopping. - Okay, can I make a list real quick? No, no, no, no, I don't do lists. It's all, it's all right here. I do, do lists, so I need to, it's a peace of mind thing, hold on. - Are you coming? - No, what if we forget something? Okay, but if you're gonna forget something, won't you also forget to put it on the list? What? Come on. It doesn't even make sense, if you, you, you, you put it on a list when you remember it. Hold on, so if, so if your boss chooses your story on the pearl for the cover, you'll get a promotion? Yeah, and then I get to have more control of the kinds of stories we do and when I become Creative Director, I wanna do more like these. Hi, can we have two, please? - Have you ever had these? - Coconuts? Well they're called Neo Domo, they're a type of coconut, yeah. - Thank you. - Cool. Thank you. They are amazing. Cheers to trying new things. Yeah, well that's, that is, it's a lot sweeter than I thought it would be. See? Can't get that from a book, now can you? Here, here, here you go. So if we don't get a picture of the pearl, then you get neither the promotion nor the cover? But I have a secret weapon. You. - And do you, do you like beige? - I prefer blue. Try these. Look a solar shower. - What's that? - A solar shower. You fill it up with water, you hang it up in a tree and then the sun heats the water and when you're done you just pack it up and you're ready to go. How cool is that? Look at that. I mean most women I know wouldn't wanna take a shower from a bag hanging in a tree, but... Yeah, they just read about it. Hi. This is a lot of stuff. Yeah, there's a little expedition happening. Well, look at that. Little blue pearls. So this is in reference to the legend, right? You find the blue pearl and then you find true love? Yeah, it's too bad no one's ever found it though. All those doomed relationships. Well Colin here, did write a book about it. It's a fiction book, but still. Wait, Colin. You're, you're Colin Page? Yes. Oh my gosh, I've read your book. I read all your books. Papa, papa come here. Hello. This is the guy who wrote Pearl in Paradise. Blake Montoya, in the flesh. - It is a pleasure to meet you. - Actually, I'm... I'm Malakai and this is my daughter, Daniela. - Hi. - Hi, Daniela. - This is my friend, Alex. - Hi, I'm Alex Anderson. It's nice to meet you. We love that book. My business has tripled because of it. People come from all around the world just to find the blue pearl. - Bula. - Bula. But they always leave empty handed. Well, they've come to find the pearl. Well, how romantic, when's the big day? - No, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - We're not, it's a strictly professional. - Professional. I'm a photographer for Natural Discoveries Magazine. I cannot believe the real Blake Montoya is standing right here in my store. Actually I'm not, I'm not Blake Montoya. He's just a character that I created. I'm a writer, I'm an author, so... My name is Colin Page. I'm Colin Page. I know that, but how different can you be? You wrote it. Blake Montoya came from somewhere, right? Hey Daniela, call your mother and tell her to come down here. No, no, no, you don't need to do that. I'll just text her. - Will you autograph it? - Sure. Malakai, M-A-L-A-K-A-I. Okay. - And Daniela. - Sure. Do you guys happen to know of a local guy, someone that can take us on a hike? It would be my honor, if I could take you and your fiance up to find the pearl, no charge. - We can leave in the morning. - Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. But are you okay? I mean it's gonna be three days out of your time. Two days, there are roads part way up we can drive. That's great news. No, no, no, no, no. I have to take pictures along the way for the magazine, so we'll be hiking. We could pull over and you can take pictures - of the things... - Can I go with you, please? My daughter will come, she's an avid hiker. The more the merrier. Yeah, no, we'll get the photos to your Editor-in-Chief sooner if we do that, if we don't hike. I have so much to learn from an experienced outdoorsman like Blake Montoya. I'm not winning this argument, am I? No. Pictures. Smile. Well, Mr. Blake Montoya, hope you've done your research. Okay. Hi. - So her name is Serita? - Yes. And she works here at the library? I mean I just wanna interview her for the article. She knows about the pearl? She does, but I think it's always important to get a local perspective, you know? Have some unique insight, it could be valuable, important. But I thought that you were the expert. I am. But you can never learn too much about the pearl, plus you're gonna get some beautiful photographs if you haven't already. It's right here. Serita? - Colin. - Hi. It's so nice to see you. - And this is? - Hi, I'm Alex. It's nice to meet you. - Thank you. - The both of you. Please sit. - I found the journal for you, Colin. - That is amazing, Serita. It's a collection of handmade maps, notes, even some poems. Poems? Do you, do... Is it okay if I leaf through it? My great grandfather, he wrote many poems to his beloved wife back home. Oh that's sweet. It's like a love story unfolding right before you eyes. Would you mind if I took some shots? Of course. The journal can be read in many ways. You can see it for what it is or for what you want it to be. Okay, this is amazing. Serita, I appreciate it. Yeah, me too. And you know it's nice to finally meet you face to face. Well you can learn a lot from a face. Would it be alright if I borrowed this for a few days, just to get your grandfather's perspective and I promise you that I will guard it with my life. I have no doubt in my heart you will. That's great. This is great. He loves his research. Hi. - Hi. - Hey. You came down. Yeah, I thought I'd take a little bit of a break. Yeah. - How's the food? - It's excellent. - Good. - Yeah. Really, really good. I just wanted to let you know how excited I am about tomorrow. - You are? - Yeah. That is my cue to get back to work. No, no, no, no, no. You have to dance with me, come on. It looks like fun, try it. Come on, dance with me. Oh boy, I haven't danced in a while. All right, well I know you know how. Come on, just loosen up a little bit. Nobody's looking at you, don't worry. You're doing good, see? - Blake Montoya can dance, right? - Well, I'm not Blake, so... I love this music. - This is nice, huh? - Yeah. - This is fun. - This is fun, you're right. Look at that. Now you really get to show me how you can dance. - What are you doing? - I should get some work done. I should get some work done, but I will see you tomorrow. - Bright and early. - Okay. - Good night, Alex. - Colin. Okay, night. - Hey, sorry I'm late. - Hey, you look, you look great. You look like a character out of one of my books. And you look like you're ready to hike the Fijian rainforest. Hey. - Hey. - Hey guys. - Bula, let's hit the road. - All right. - Hey. - Thank you. Okay. Hey, I brought my camera, too. Maybe you can give me some pointers. - Sure, yeah. - Thanks. I was on the yearbook staff in my high school, you know? That is very cool. You know I would say the key is to find something you're passionate about. Something that really inspires you. This is beautiful. Yeah, it is. Well, let's go, Mr. Montoya. We don't have to go in there, do we? - In there? - Yeah, it's a jungle, Colin. You're not afraid of spiders, are you? Why? Why? Dang it. Okay. I don't like this. Blake Montoya. Malakai, what is it? It's a Tagimoucia orchid. How can it be? A what? A Tagimoucia. It means to cry in your sleep. It's beautiful. That's the national flower of Fiji, isn't it? Isn't that right? Yeah, but it only grows on the island of Taveuni. Northeast of here. I've never seen one on this island. It means something. Yeah, sometimes things appear when least expected. - It's really something actually. - Yeah, it is. - You okay? - Thanks. Yeah, no I'm fine. - Got you. - Thank you. I'm good. Sorry, sometimes I just get all wrapped up in getting that shot. You sure it's not your shoes because you know you need the ones - with the tread. - The boots with the tread - and the waterproof lining. - And the waterproof lining. Yeah, I've got all that. - Who taught you that? - A very wise woman. - Very good at what she does. - She is good at what she does. Watch your step. Look, it's an old balabala. That's beautiful. That is very cool. Why don't you try this? - Really? - Yeah, go ahead. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh no. - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, it's okay. - Are you okay? - I'm okay, but your lens. You know what actually I don't think it's broke. Alright, I have some lens wipes in my bag here. It'll be okay. I thought I put 'em in here. Do you have any? No. I must have left 'em at home. - This is my only short zoom. - Can I see it for a second? Okay, just don't wipe it on your shirt. You'll scratch the lens. I know. So the tannic acid in black tea acts as a non-abrasive cleansing agent. To dissolve the dirt. Look at that. Good as new. Remarkable, how did you know that? A bit of research. I know a lot about tea. In Diamonds in Dubai. Blake Montoya was trying to catch an exporter who was smuggling gems from Europe in crates of tea. Blake Montoya strikes again. - Thanks. - Yeah. Alright, we'll stop here and make camp for the night. That's terrific. Exhausted. I'm exhausted. Not here. Down there. Down there? It's too steep to hike, so we'll tie off a line to be safe and descend by rope. Did he just say descend by rope? Okay. Good to go. Who's going first? Colin? Actually I think that one of us should probably go first. No, no, no, no, I got it, Alex. I can go, I can go. You can watch me go down. Alex, it's a rope, how hard can it be? - Seriously I can help you. - Seriously I'm fine. I just pitch it down, right? You throw the rope out. Why don't you just tell them you've never done this before? All right, guys. See you at the bottom. How hard can it be? You okay? Hey, I'm coming down. I'm okay. I'm okay. Come on. - Don't move, are you okay? - No, I'm okay, I'm okay. - I'm all right. - Are you sure? - I'm okay. - You fell pretty far. We're gonna build, we'll go pitch tents. Yeah no, Daniela and I can do that. One of you guys go gather some firewood. Yeah, we'll do that. Colin, this way. - All right. - This way. I'm okay. You know I could have helped you out there. What would Blake Montoya have done? He would have been the first to grab the rope just like you. There you go. I gotta be honest. It was thrilling. I mean until obvi... until it wasn't and then it hurt. - It just hurt. - It looked like it hurt. So what does your boyfriend think about you being gone all the time when you're trekking around the world taking pictures of volcanoes and wild animals and stuff or is that, is that too personal? No, no, it's not too personal. Well trekking around the world and taking pictures of volcanoes and wild animals and stuff is exactly why I don't have a boyfriend. Turns out in relationships, people actually wanna spend time together. - Imagine that, right? - Fancy that. What about you though? Mr. Romance slash adventure novelist. I mean you must have women lined up around the block. Yeah, I do, which is why I moved into a gated community. No all kidding aside, I date, but it just never seems to last. Why? Because I think they expect Blake Montoya. And I'm not Blake. And even Malakai and Daniela expect him and he's you know this adventure seeking guy who lives for danger and Colin Page is a writer who sits in a room all day long alone telling stories for a living. Yeah, but Colin Page is... he's smart and nice. He's got a good sense of humor. He's maybe even a little good looking. - Really? - Yeah. I got a maybe? - A little? - Just, just a little. And in the haze of the dawn, they saw it. "Could that be it?" Valencia asked. "Is that the pearl?" Blake craned his head closer and saw the magnificent opalescent shimmer. At last, they found it. It is an honor to be reading your book with you. Papa, don't interrupt. My favorite part's coming up. They kiss after they find the blue pearl. Do you think the pearl's gonna look like that when we find it? Do you think the clam's gonna be there, too? That is confidential. So? Starry night. The pearl of love. When all seemed lost I turned my back on the rocks and I followed the path of my tears. Where I fell asleep for 50 years. Busy? Here you go. Soursop. Native fruit to Fiji. That's amazing, thank you. I didn't think you'd ever tried it before. No. I get the sense this might be your first time to Fiji. You got that from our first day hiking? I got that from the first time you walked into my store. Geez. Was that obvious? Malakai, I gotta be honest with you, man. I am a fraud, in every sense of the word. Yeah, I wouldn't say that my friend. The only person you can be is you. No, there's something that I have to tell Alex that I haven't told her yet. I don't know where the pearl is. - I know. - You know? Of course, nobody does. It's a fairy tale, it's a myth. It's good for business and a fun story and people come from all around the world just to find the blue pearl, but nobody ever does. No, Malakai, I'm sorry. Look, look, look, look, I know generally where it is, it's on the other side of the river. It's there, I just don't know exactly where it's buried. And that what I was hoping was that this journal would, I don't know, provide some clues, some link to my missing... See he found it. Well he claimed to have found the pearl, he knew where it was. Perhaps you have to ask yourself if he found it, why would he have left it? Look, my friend, Ku operates a Eco-village not far from here. About three kilometers away. His father, Akamu knows a great deal about the legend. Maybe he can help. - Yeah? - Yeah. That would be awesome. Colin, good night. Good night. - Thank you again. Night. - All right. All right. I'll see you tomorrow. Of my tears where I fell asleep for 50 years and I woke to the prize of your bright starry eyes and saw them reflected where your love forever lies. I didn't know you were such a poet. No, this is the, this is the poem that Serita's great grandfather wrote to his wife. It's a love poem. And it's, I don't know, this journal is filled with, look at it, sketches, and pressed flowers. And then you got a waterfall. What do you think all this stuff means? I don't know. It's a mystery. Speaking of mystery, look up there. I love the night sky. My dad used to take me camping when I was little and I always used to sleep underneath the stars. I loved it, I still do. Look at that one right up there. Straight ahead right there. That's Sagittarius. I figured you'd like it 'cause it's shaped like a teapot. - It's a teapot. - Yeah. And right next to Sagittarius is Aquila. You know constellations? Yeah, I'm, I read the Odyssey while I was in 8th grade I became a bit of a star nerd. I read that. - Yeah? - I loved it. - Yeah, great book. - It's a great book, yeah. That book made me wanna learn everything I could about stars. Made me wanna travel the world. Yeah, you know I always wanted to do this piece on astronomy for the magazine. And what I would do is I would create a travel map, right? And I'd start in the Northern Hemisphere and I would show you all the constellations you'd see as you traveled south. - That's a great idea. - Yeah? Why didn't you do it? Last Creative Director killed it, so I just kinda forgot about it. It's a brilliant idea. Promise me that you'll revisit it because that is a trip that even I would make. - Really? - Yeah. All right then, I'll keep that in my back pocket. - Well, I'm pretty tired. - You gonna go to sleep? Yeah. - Hey Alex. - Yes. Sweet dreams. You too. - So this is your friend's Eco-lodge? - Totally off the grid. Operated by my friend, Ku. Once was a place his grandmother lived. The villagers all moved out, but she wanted to preserve it. What I wanna do is interview Ku's father for the article. Yeah, I think that'd be great. This place is lovely. My friend I've asked him. - My friend. - Hey, hey, hey. You finally made it. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Come to see. - Remember my daughter, - Daniela? - Of course. - Hey, good to see you again. - Good to see you, Daniela. This is Colin, the famous author of Pearl in Paradise. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. Alex, a famous American photographer. - Pleased to meet you, Alex. - It's nice to meet you. - Ku, can Colin talk to your father? - He's not here. But he's coming over for dinner. You could meet him then. Yeah? That would be perfect, thank you. Please come with me, right this way. - How are you? - Not too bad, man. It's good to see you. You've done some renovation. Yes, yes, yes, you like it? Well thank you guys so much for having us for dinner, Mr. Akamu. - Just Akamu. - Akamu, sorry. So Alex and I are working on an article together about the pearl for the magazine that she works for. Natural Discoveries, I'm taking the pictures and he's writing the article. Yeah and Malakai said that you know a great deal about the pearl. As do you. I know your book. A fine tale. Yeah well, thank you. Which leads me to ask you a question. Do you think that the description of the pearl in my book... Lived up to your experience of it? I've never seen it. I'm confused. - How do you know it exists? - Because I do. A British man wrote about it many years ago. Right, right, I have his journal. Should I, do you wanna see it? There is a little known legend among my people, - about the origin of the pearl. - Yeah? The legend of the fisherman. You've done your research. Wait a minute, the legend of... that's not in your book. No, no, but I mean I know of its existence. You can't find it anywhere online. There's no written record of it. It's oral history. Do you know it? Could you tell us? 600 years ago, there was a poor fisherman, in love with the daughter of a wealthy aristocrat who would not let them marry. One day, while he was looking for clams in the Navua River, he navigated through a tributary and there he found a giant clam. The clam opened, revealing a beautiful rare blue pearl. The fisherman was ecstatic. What luck! He thought if he gave the pearl to the young woman, he'd prove to her and her family that he was worthy of their daughter's hand in marriage. So he put the pearl in a wooden box to present to the family. As he sailed back, the rains came rocking the small boat. The pearl fell back into the water. The fisherman was so devastated, he couldn't bring himself to face the young woman. He spent his remaining years searching in vain for the pearl. And cried in his sleep for 50 years. Over the next few centuries, the tributary dried up. And it is said that the fisherman's decades of tears now flow over the rocky shores that remain in its wake. It is believed that the pearl represents the love that the young woman and the fisherman should have had. He spent his entire life going after the pearl, when he should have been going after her heart. He thought that the pearl would make him worthy of her love, but he already had her love. He lost his faith in her. The pearl itself was worth nothing. Its worth is what is accorded to it. Find the fisherman's lost love, and you will find the pearl. Now, enough talk, please eat. This looks, this looks very good. Hey. Good morning. Good morning, Daniela. How are you? How are you guys? We're doing good, how'd you sleep? Yeah, pretty good, how 'bout you? - Like a baby. - A bit buggy. Malakai, where's your stuff? Yeah it rained further down the island and there may be flooding. Akamu's asked me to hang around and help out. You two should be fine to navigate the rest of the way by yourself, yeah? Be careful and we'll see you when you get back. - With the pearl. - With the pearl. Got it. Hey, thanks for everything. Rained further down the island, really? Seemed believable to me. They have to do this on their own. You know that, Daniela. I do. - Look at this. - Look at me. Okay, now look away. It's good. Hey. Thank you. - For taking your picture? - No, for this. For pitching the idea for the article. I mean I wouldn't have come here otherwise. That's really sweet. Yeah, you're welcome. I can't, Alex. What are you talking about, yeah you can. No, I mean I have something that I need to tell you, Alex. And it's something that I should've been honest about before we even left for Fiji. Okay. I don't know exactly where the pearl is buried. Okay, but you... you know like generally where it is, right? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry, I thought I was gonna be able to piece together information from the journal and interviews. If you are just now telling me this. Okay, hold on, I wanted to tell you sooner, but then you told me how high the stakes were with your promotion and inspiring people. And, and, and, and I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why did you lie to me? Why would you lie to me? I didn't plan on this and I didn't want to let you down. For the first time in my life I thought that I could be as adventurous and as exciting as this figment of my imagination that I cannot live up to. I mean... He always knows the right things to say and I clearly don't. And when you called me and you offered me this opportunity, I was scared, Alex, I didn't wanna do it, but I was also so excited and I thought for a second if I could just, that if we could do this, that we could find this pearl that somehow I'd fix it, but all it did is prove that I am a disappointment. And I'm sorry, I'm sorry that I lied to you. I am sorry that I wasted your time and I am sorry that I got your hopes up, Alex. So. I guess we should head back, huh? Colin, Colin. For somebody who doesn't know what to say, you certainly knew what to say. And I gotta be honest with you. If you would've told me all of that back in New York, that you didn't know where the pearl was. I still would've come on this trip. But would you ask me to come with you? Yeah. Look at this. Look at where we are right now. I mean who knows what's out there, right? Who knows what we're gonna see. And I wanna inspire people and I know you wanna inspire people. So let's do this. Let's keep going. - You with me? - Yeah. What have we got to lose? This is beautiful. Okay, according to this map... - Yeah. - Look, there's a bridge about a mile that way, so you know we'd have to double back, but. No, no, I say we cross it. Yeah. It doesn't look that deep. It's, it's, it's moving. - Pretty fast. - That's not fast, you'll be fine. Look, everything that's important goes in a dry bag. What's a dry bag? You are prepared. All right then. Good luck. Alex. Alex! Come here. I got you, I got you. I got it. I'll get it. Here. Come here, come here. You okay? Yeah. You? All right, I told you we should have taken the bridge. The bridge. I'm so sorry. I will listen to you from now on. I gotta tell you though, we make a good team, huh? - Yeah, we do. - Yeah, we do. All that's missing is the pearl, right? Yeah, the pearl. You know what? I don't even care about my promotion anymore. - Yeah? - No. That's crazy. I haven't thought about my book in three days. Yeah, I just, I just wanna find the pearl. I want us to find that pearl. I really do. And I think that we should, we should keep going. - I'm so close. - Yeah. What? What? Wait, are you crying? No, I got, a bug in my eye. - It looks like you're crying. - My eye. Wait a minute. - Hold on. - What? I just, I just thought of something that Akamu said last night. He was talking about the fisherman and the decades of tears. Right, decades of tears. Fisherman's decades of tears flow over the rocky shores. - You have a very good memory. - All up here, remember? Yeah, hey, can you just can I see that journal? Yeah. - Here. - Okay. Could you, could you just show me the page that you were looking at with the waterfall? Decades of tears. - The waterfall. - The waterfall. - It's the waterfall. - Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay, so we are here and the waterfall is here. - That is where we need to be. - Bingo. Yes! It's a waterfall. I mean... look at this! You're right, you can't get this from a book. Right? All right, here, I wanna document this moment. Yes. - All right, ready? - Yeah. You gonna smile? One, two. It's not perfect, but it's got something. We gotta be close. I definitely see how this place can bring out the poet in anyone. Wait. What did you just say? I was just saying how beautiful it is. It can almost turn anybody into a poet. Look at this place. Oh my gosh, the poem. Okay, the fisherman's tears. It's the waterfall. When all seemed lost, I turned my back on the rocks. And followed the path of my tears. It's the stream. Where I fell asleep for 50 years. What is that? Tagimoucia, it means to cry in your sleep. Tagimoucia. Come on. And I woke to the prize of your glittering eyes. And saw them reflected where my love forever lies. Reflected. Reflected where your love forever lies. Colin, let me see that journal! - What? - Come here. - Look. - Oh my gosh. Hold on, let me get a shot of it. - Got it? - Okay, yeah. Be careful. Do you feel anything? Wait, I feel something. - You do? - Yeah. Alex. I think, I think we just found it. I think we just found it. Open it. Yes! It's beautiful. Those worthy of the pearl can never have found the pearl. Okay, hold it up. I'm gonna get a shot with you in it. Hold on, those worthy of the pearl can never have found the pearl. What? - Colin. - We can't. Why? We can't take a picture. But we can't rely just on your writing, we have to take... Those worthy of the pearl can never have found the pearl. We can't have found the pearl. What are you talking about? We just found the pearl. I know. In order to find the pearl, you have to have faith that the pearl existed, right? And if picture's proof, that's what Akamu and Serita were trying to tell us. Proof denies faith. And without faith, I mean the pearl, it doesn't mean anything. Yeah, because we would ruin the legend. Yeah. Yeah, if the value of the pearl is what we accord it, so it's a promotion at work or it's a writing career. It's a love that last a lifetime. It's whatever you want it to be. Okay. I get it. Looking at a pearl in the museum isn't the same as coming out here to find it for yourself. I'm sorry. I just, I just really wanna inspire people, you know? You still can. Well. Thanks, Malakai. I'll miss you. Thank you for everything. Take care, my friends. I'm sorry you didn't find the pearl. Yeah, me too. Thanks, Malakai. Well have a safe flight, Colin. Bye, Alex. I know, what would Blake Montoya do right? No, Colin Page. How do you feel? I feel a lot of things, but, but... You're a writer. Do what you do best. Thank you, Malakai. Thank you. You gave me an idea! Let's go. - Hello, Derek, it's Colin. - Hello, Colin? Yeah, hey buddy, can you hear me? - I'm back at the hotel now. - You keep breaking up. Okay, I'm back at the hotel. I think my phone might be wet. Anyway, are you there? So did you find the pearl? Tell me you found the pearl. No, but I have an amazing idea for an article. You keep cutting out. I said I have an amazing idea for an article. So did you find it? Listen, I'm, okay listen, I'm gonna send you an article. - It's gonna be amazing. - This is great news. I'll call the editor and let her know. Great, thanks, all right. I'll send it to you tonight. Bye. Sharon, I have got some great news. - They found the pearl? - They had to. Colin assured me the article is going to be amazing. We've got our cover story. I'll keep an eye out for it. Alex, I just got the good news from Colin's agent that you guys found the pearl and his article will be submitted tonight! Congrats! Can't wait to see your photos! I'm off to a meeting, but I'll see you when you get back! What? Hey, Alex. Alex? Yes? Hi. Do you know where the woman is who's staying in this room? She checked out, sir. You just missed her. Thank you. Hey, Alex! Hey, hey, hey, hey Alex. - Are you leaving? - I heard you wrote the article. Yeah, yeah, I wanted to tell you about it. You don't have to do that. I talked to my editor, she told me all about it. - She did? - Yeah, well played. You got your article, none of the photos. Hold on a second, let me explain. You know what Colin? This is all about you and selling more books. Alex. Why would he betray me like this? - I just, I don't understand. - I'm sorry. You know he's the one who told me to keep it a secret and to have faith and then he just goes off and does it anyway. Sometimes people aren't who you think they are. Yeah, tell me about it. When did you get so organized? I just, I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense to me. I mean he was so, he was so fun and smart. We make a pretty good team. Make? - You just said make. - I did? I didn't mean that. I mean made, made a good team. I just read the article. Honestly, it's brilliant. I'm sending it to the magazine right now. That is great. And hey, you were right, I was playing it safe with my new novel. Is this the same Colin I meet with a week ago? Let's just say that I found the inspiration I've been missing. Well that's terrific. So are you gonna finish writing Treasures in Taipei? Actually, no. I gotta a whole new idea. Hey, welcome back. Sharon, I'm sorry. I messed up again. And I completely understand why Ben is the better candidate for this promotion - and if you wanna fire me... - Fire you? Why would I wanna fire my new Creative Director? You're not gonna fire me? I'm the new... Okay, but I didn't get any pictures of the pearl. Well, how could you? You didn't find it. - Well your voicemail. - Complete miscommunication. Colin's agent thought he'd found it, but turns out it was bad cell reception. Anyway, it doesn't matter. What I really need is a photo of you and Colin together. - Us? - For the cover. - You do have some of those, right? - Yeah, yeah, I've got some. This is hands down the best cover story we've ever done. - Didn't he send it to you? - No. Well I'm emailing it now. You need to read this. In pursuit of a magical pearl hidden deep in the lush rainforests of Viti Levu, I found something completely unexpected. After a challenging three day hike with a charming and brilliant photographer named Alex, and our two guides, I add my name to the long list of adventurers and lovers hoping to lay weary eyes on a rare blue pearl that hundreds of years ago, disappeared into the swirling, stormy sea. A pearl that now lies somewhere in a sun-kissed valley paradise waiting to be found. Alex and I never found the pearl. But the quest offered us something more precious. It's only when we open our hearts, ready to risk the unknown, that life's treasures reveal themselves. And our hearts can love a thousand times more than we ever imagined. And if you believe that there's magic out there, it's yours to find. Alex knew that all along. And she inspired me to go on a different kind of journey. No, I didn't find the legendary blue pearl, but I found out who I want to be and who I want to be with. And in the end, love is the greatest adventure of all. Alex, I have a delivery for you. Should I bring them up? Yeah, thank you. Hello? - Hi. - Hey Alex. It's nice hearing your voice. I read your article. Yeah and what did you think of it? Well, some of the technical details didn't ring so true for me. You're a funny girl. Some conversations are better had in person than well, with flowers. Did you mean everything you said in that article? Alex, I'm standing in your office with rare flowers from Fiji, which I think officially makes me a international smuggler. Yes. I meant every single word. I just want you to know that sometimes I'm not organized. I like that. And I don't ever, ever wanna make a list. Check. And I don't like tea. All right, we're working on that one. - And... - And? In the legend, it says that only true love can find the pearl and in your article, you said we didn't. Hold on. It's not the blue pearl. But it's ours. That's that. It's the most beautiful pearl I have ever seen. No, you are. Come on. Hurry up, I'm dying to explore the reef. Okay, okay, I just wanna finish this chapter. You know I could tell you how it ends, right? Don't you dare. Come on.
