Copy. - Take some pictures. - Roger. Getting imagery now. And of the nuclear facility. Look at that, they got the whole thing underground. Even the chimneys are hidden. Come on Oliver, let's wrap it up. Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey, hey! You've seen our paperwork. Which is working on the telephone lines... No, no, no! He's just quiet, he doesn't talk much. By the Ayatollah. Hey, hey! Scan all frequencies. Any charter back to Tehran? Negative, no radio transmissions. It's okay. Just my phone. Look. See? Come here. Look, see? Come here. Now you got fast internet. Ey? Still want to call Quds Force? Come here. Come here. Come here, watch. Football. See? It's a goal! Yeah. It's a goal! Incredible... They just pulled away from the sight. Keep eyes in the sky on them. You think they're onto us? We're not hanging from a crane yet. Don't worry, our cover's tight, we're good. I'm ready for this one to be over. Watching right up. UAVs and drones on standby. Maneuver's a go. Execute. Breaching firewall. System running at 95%. Confirm the alarms are disabled in centrifuge room. Confirming, alarms disabled. Eyes on guard, still no movement. The Trojan horse is active, and we are undetected. Copy, no detection. We're in the mainframe now. How much time? Ten hours until it hits the centrifuges. Twelve until meltdown. Continue monitoring the CCTV. Copy. Three, two, one. I'm Luna Kujai, and this is your Middle East update broadcasting live from Oman. Tensions continue after Iran's decision to abandon nuclear negotiations with Western powers. Still no boots on the ground, as promised by the US. Three, two, one. Still no boots on the ground, as promised by the US and its allies, after their withdrawal of conventional forces in Afghanistan. Yet the shadow war wages on. Elite American and British units continue to hunt down high value targets in denied territories. In the last month alone, the assassinations of two Iranian nuclear scientists and a top Al-Qaeda leader... James, James, what do I do now? Okay, I'm sending the file. Open the key to encrypt the connection point to point, we gotta hurry. Oh, my God! This exposes their entire operations. And that's why we got to be careful okay. But no names, you hear me? Okay? Protect the assets. Yes, I promise, I promise, just, just the companies, the CIA is using for cover, right? I just want them to know I'm a patriot that I'm protecting my country, that's why I'm doing this. Yeah. Wait, someone's coming, I gotta go. James? Der Herald Newspaper, how may I assist your call? Hi, this is Luna Kujai. Please connect me to Hans Forzburg's office. Uh, yeah, yeah, tell him it's an emergency. - Luna, what have you got? - Hello, Hans? My Pentagon source just came through. Can we verify the information? Yeah. The CIA's Black Ops. Jesus, are you sure? Yeah, trust me. It'll be bigger than Snowden and WikiLeaks combined. Fantastic work, Luna. You're exposing the Hypocrisy and we're going front page with it. I'll call Langley, make sure we're on. We better be. Some maintenance guy checks that junction box, we're fucked. - Hello? - Hey, it's me. Huh, every time you call, it's from a different number. Listen, I get in late tomorrow night to Gatwick. I'll call you if my flight's delayed, alright? And make sure you're on the plane this time, Tom. 'Cause Ida's already told her friends that her fucking dad will be there for her graduation. Alright, don't start, Cory. I mean you know, the job dictates everything. Well, you know what, you need to dictate it this time or you're gonna break her heart. And... I... I also need you to sign the papers. And, I suppose I could finally move on. Are you seeing somebody? Yeah, I am. Is this serious? I just want to stop living in this purgatory. You know what I mean, look at your things. They're all over the flat. I'll do whatever you need, alright? I just... I want you to be happy. Sure you're gonna go right back there after the graduation. - You'll never quit. - I... - Admit it. - What do you want from me? I mean, I don't have anything else on my resume, do I? You know you can teach. - Teach? - Yeah, teach. Y... you've got the degree. I'm not really that interested in sitting behind a desk all day. - I'm sorry, Cory. - Okay. - About everything. - Just... Just please be safe, will you? And please be on that flight. Okay. Yeah. Hello? It is good to hear your voice. Any problems getting in the country? No, they bought the cover story. And my fingerprints weren't in the system, like you said. You know I got you back. But still, you got to be careful. If they find out who you really are... I know the risk, Roman. Trust me. But I said I will do this job, and I will. I know you would. That's why I got that info you wanted. Nahal Hosseini. I'll text you her number. Thank you, thanks. When does your friends come here? Day after tomorrow. Roman, it's just a translating job, right? Just translating, yes. Okay, I got to go. Status? Centrifuges are at temperature, sir. Distributing variable spin speed. It's moving up now. Increasing to 70,000 rpm. - Do they know we're in? - No, sir. We're still clean. Do it. Is everyone at their stations? Increasing speeds to 90,000 rpm. Tracking pressure increase in reactive space. Temperature continuing to rise. Now at 800 degrees. They manually triggered their emergency alarms. They triggered the halon gas system. Alright, I'm off to the airport. - Anything from Roman? - All clean. Alright, make sure... clean out the house. Wipe down all the hard drives, ey? - Full burn down. - You got it. Say hello to the free world for me. Take care. How the fuck can you be running out of ammunition? When the Americans left you with it? That was a long time ago, Kahil, we're also fighting Daesh. New ISISK fighters coming in from the Gulf every single day. Mullah Omar is dead. Done gone, now what? I know they don't understand a word I'm saying right now. But you better. Can't have you pull this crazy shit all over again. Chopping heads off. Beating women in public. Taking selfies. The world is watching. And you have to show them that you are modernizing. Because I can't have my leaders face sanctions. But what you're worried about is the dangers of little girls going to school. I'm not worried about little girls in schools. Then what're you worried about? Traitors, Kahil, traitors. You continue this revenge shit. There will be no sanctuary for you or anyone of you anywhere in Pakistan. Because the Americans will come again. And they will bomb the fuck out of you, again. So you'll be running around in circles. Remember who put you in that chair, Rasoul. Who made you, who protected you when you were being fucked hard. Salaam Alaikum. As the United States, Israel and other Western powers continue to deny any involvement in the sabotage of Iran's nuclear reactor today near Kam there are still no suspects. Many are reminded of Stuxnet, the malicious computer virus that caused the centrifuge meltdown of their tanks facility that incident followed on for many other incidents... Are you still coming home tomorrow? No, Mr. Hans wants me in Berlin first thing. Oh, wait, so you're going to Berlin? Yeah, I have to supervise the edit. Well, Lilly and I are sure proud of you. - You did it. - Oh, thanks, love. I miss you both so much. - Has she been good? - Yeah, she's been... Wait, w... w... what? Help! Help me! Are you okay? - Help! - What's going on? Answer me! Luna! - Help! - I'll call the police! Whoa! There he is! Ah! Bring it in! - How are you? - Fine. Come on, let's get you a drink. Good to see you all in one piece. It's all for show. The usual? Cheers! Sick and tired of working in this cesspool while looking for the American dream. Yeah, why am I here, Roman? Your flight was delayed. Well, I know. It leaves in 92 minutes. Hmm. I'm gonna push it back again! Come with me. And they said it couldn't be done. My favorite horse... always delivers. Yeah, they'll just build another one. Of course they will. And that's why I need you for the next phase. Yeah, when I get back. No, no, this one can't wait. Come upstairs. I don't know, you just tell me when to stop. I told you, Roman. When I get back. Job starts tomorrow, three days work. You'll be back in time for Ida's graduation. Oh, are you tapping my phones now? This job is making you paranoid. You're gonna sign those divorce papers? Stay out my fucking personal life, alright? - What personal life? - Yeah. I worry about you, Tommy. Maybe if you open your mind, you could find some peace, too. I sure did. Right, yeah. Okay, do it for Ida then. She wants to be a doctor, right? Hmm? You could put her through any medical school she wants. Where's the job? Here. Melting Iran's shiny new toy was just the beginning. Langley wants a covert airstrip just across the Afghan border near Taybad. We're gonna go in there and destroy their whole nuclear program before they have the chance to build the big bomb. You'll insert here on the Afghan side in Iran. Jesus. Herat is crawling with foreign spooks. And you can't get anybody else for this? I don't want anybody else. Only know with you, it's not just all about the money. Alright. See this? Taliban control all of this. Right? North, west, east. And your warring militias taking shots at them all. - What's the cover story? - There's none. It's black through and through. - You're on your own. - Fuck. Alright, if I do this, I'm going to need a handler, a good one. Somebody who speaks both Dari and Pashtun and knows this fucking area. He's in country right now. Tom. - Salaam alaikum. - Wa-alaykumus-salaam. My name is Mohammed. But everyone calls me, Mo. I brought you change of clothes. Is there anyone around here who drives a brand new SUV? You know we're supposed to blend in, right? We will. Americans left dozens of these at the embassy. Even these drug dealers have one of these. Where's the safe house? Kandahar, which is north of Herat. Taliban? Yeah. The country is locked up tight. So, I mean, if you need something, just let me know. I will make a run. So I take it you're from around here? Yeah, born and raised till I was 16. Will anyone recognize you? No, I don't think so. Yeah, I haven't been here for a very long time. I mostly lived in Kabul. Welcome to New Afghanistan. Same as the old. Yeah. My name is Farzad Asadi. I'm a colonel in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps. Jerusalem force. I'm not a spy. I know you're not a spy. Then why am I here? Come on. I have a daughter, too. Help me get you home. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Two days ago, an American named James Vincent sent you information about my country's nuclear program. And now one of our nuclear plants has been sabotaged. Tell me about the company you were researching. You had files on your computer. A Swiss company, Civlix. Okay, if you look at Civlix locations... they were working exclusively in the nuclear and military facilities. Any names at Civlix? Please. We didn't get any names. We didn't... we didn't get any... - No... no names. We don't... - Give me some names. I'm telling you the truth. We didn't get any names. Please believe me. Wait. Please believe me. Please. You said I could go home. You will. As a martyr. Please! You said, I could go home. Please. There's only one bedroom. Okay. Package arrived for you yesterday. What is your mission? Go to Landing Strip near Taybad. Taybad. Taybad is in Iran. We leave at sundown. What do you mean we? What, Roman didn't tell you? No, he just said I'm supposed to pick you up and be your translator, but here in Herat. Alright, call him. Salaam Alaikum. C-I-A... Breaking news from Der Herald newspaper exposing the CIA's illegal black operations in the Middle East. They include the sabotage of Iran's top secret nuclear reactor near Qom. The information was leaked by a Pentagon whistle-blower after passing classified documents... Come on now, hurry, pick up the phone. Missing. Many speculate she's being held in an Iranian prison awaiting public execution. Focuses on CIA operatives who posed as telecommunication contractors for a Swiss company called, Civlix causing the meltdown of Iran's reactor. The fallout from this disclosure could be devastating for Western interests. - Yo. - Put the news on. Any channel. Just have him and tell the guy watching the safehouse. There was a breach at the Pentagon. We're exposed. How bad? They got your picture and your alias but not your real name. Can't get in touch with Oliver, Tommy. What's the play? Well, mission's aborted. Let me get you out of there. Hang tight. Roman, I've got Chris Hoyt here with me. Head of our special operations group. The deputy director asked him to sit in. - More the merrier. - The field asset. - Tell me about him. Who is he? - Tom Harris. A lifer. A loan to us from MI6. Total chameleon. He's one of my go to low-vis guys. And he's running with a former Afghan translator that we flew in to assist. Sounds like the life of the party. Are the Iranians their only problem? Are you joking? I mean, Afghanistan right now is like Cold War Berlin. Yeah, Talibs, Paks, Indians, Russians, Chinese, and then you got ISISK too backwards for even Al-Qaeda. Any of them catch my guy will sell him to the highest bidder. Unfortunately, we're gonna have to cut them loose. - We have no other options. - Yes, we do. Chris, come on. You know that 22 SAS is in country right now. Hunting Al-Qaeda's second in command. He's right. The Brits' flight out leaves in 30 hours. Okay, I'll have the deputy director call MI6. I'm sure they'll be happy to get their man back. I'm doing the burn run now. I'm sorry, Tommy. This is your only shot of getting out. That's alright. I know what I signed up for. If anyone can make it, it's you. Extraction point... is an old CIA base in Kandahar province using a C-130. Less than a minute on the ground. How far from Kandahar are they? About 400 miles. But the distance is not the main issue. It's what's in between. Alright. What are you doing? Cover's blown. - Get your stuff. - How? Doesn't matter how. We'll leave for Kandahar in 15 minutes. Kandahar? We were supposed to leave from here tomorrow. Not anymore. Come on. Let's go. Slumming it with us again. Rasoul, I need a crew for snatch and drive in Gandhar. Use your red units. Not those guys who are always high on bugs spray. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah. Just make sure your fucking crew is ready. They're out of the safe house. Keep your eyes peeled for hostiles. - Roger that. - Start the clock. We engage if they make contact? No way. We're not working under title 50. No, we can only advise. They wonder why we can't win. Keep your eye out for a hoopty. - For what? - It's a shitty car. We got to ditch this one. You know, maybe we should have split up. I mean, I can hide here for a few days and then take a flight from Herat to Pakistan. Yeah, good idea, Mo. And get some rest before they snatch you at Herat airport. That way, you'll last longer when they start pulling your fingernails off. There's the market there. Okay, let's go this way. Where is he going? I see two SUV's approaching the market. Here. Take the bags off the back. Wait for my signal, okay? Okay. Oy, oy, oy! They're switching into a white Nissan pickup. White Nissan. Someone try to get the plates. Shit. Coming to traffic. There are two vehicles emerging. Ah. What's the way through this? The only way to Kandahar is the highway one. It's on the other side of the town. Tell him to get away from the truck, Mo. Fuck! Fuck! Fuckin' clutch. Sorry. I am sorry. Sorry, here, one minute. Yeah, here, here, here, sorry, I'm sorry, okay. Tom! Tom, go! Highway one is straight ahead. What are you doing? I'm telling you we are going the wrong way. No, it's a detour. Get down! God, I like this guy. He is good. Oh, shit. Check for a spare tire in the back. Oh, my God. Yes. Okay, I'll pull security. You change the tire. Mo, Hurry up. We're exposed out here. Yeah. Come on. What piece of shit! You do it yourself! It's the adrenaline. You're coming down. - Try to drink some water. - Who was the guy on the bike? I need you to focus, okay? Just change the fucking tire! Well... Well, well, I know... I know when I'm being lied to. Mo, where are you going? I came here to find my wife's sister. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. - Your wife's sister? - Yes. She was missing. I'm not leaving Herat until I find her. Well, you're not gonna find her if you're fucking dead. Good luck to you. - Mo? - Huh? Call him to come out. Tom, Tom, he's just a little boy. Tell him to drop it. Jesus. You won't make it on your own, Mo. Then tell me what's truly going on. This is my life in your hands. I burned their house down in Iran. The nuclear reactor? Why can't CIA agents just come and pick us up? We're cutouts in an even bigger game. But what it means is no one is coming to rescue us. Okay? So we just got to get to Kandahar, and then we'll regroup, Okay? And then I'll help you find your wife's sister. I'm sorry, Mo. I should have told you the truth earlier. Do you really think we can make it to Kandahar? Not without help. There's someone I've worked with before south of here. And maybe he has a helicopter. Let's go. Asalamualaikum. Ismail, it's Roman. Look, I need a favor. Mm-hmm. Huh. Ah... How much longer to your friend? About another 20 miles or so. Do you hear this? - Yeah. - I... I... I think there is something wrong with the tire again. That's not our car. Take the wheel, Mo! - I can't see where I'm going! - Just keep it straight! Ah! The engine's down! Get ready to bail. Let's go! Move, move! Run, Mo! - Where? - Just run! You'll always be... That's our comeback ride. Stay down, don't move. Alright. Oh, God, forgive our living and our dead. Yeah, used me as bait. But it worked. - Looks like we're on foot. - Huh. We're-we're refueling the UAV. - Where are they now? - We've lost 'em. - Has Roman checked in? - No. Why? - Copy. - Should I be worried? If those were my guys, I'd be blowing up your phone every ten minutes. Are you sure you don't want me to wait up for ya? What are you gonna do if we can't find you? I'm practically the only white dude left in this country. Can't be too hard to find. Get home safe, brother. Ah. May the dust rise and the apostles hear a cry. Let's do it. I have to pray. Ah. Ah. My knees are killing me. Here. Ah. Take this. Thank you. Thank you. Not exactly best way to break a fast, but it's all I've got. Mm... Battle buddy? His name is Siddiqui. He was my translator through six tours. For six fucking tours. Tried to get him to the, the US or London. Anywhere safe. Then ISIS rode through Mosul... and they hung him. My pleader. Yeah, we rely on you guys for everything. I mean, the language, the culture. You risk your lives for us... and then we tell you exactly what your country should look like and how you should act. Half the time we don't even say thank you. Oh, no, I'm glad you made it to the States, Mo. Got your family out. Not all of them made it. My oldest son, Hamid, was killed here. Are you married? I was. - Do you have kids? - I do. I have a, a photo. Ida. She's, uh, she's, uh, 17. She's beautiful. Ah. Thanks. I was supposed to be at her graduation this weekend. You have to go home, Tom. You have to go home and hold her in your arms before you even forget what it feels like. See, my, my Hamid is gone, and all I have left is just the picture. You know, it's funny. Here I am, talking to a guy I barely know. Somehow, I, I'm more comfortable with you than I am with family. Excuse me. That's them. Raise your hands. Let 'em know we're not a threat. That's a flag of Tajik warlord. I know. Say we're friends of Ismail Rabbani. We're asking Rabbani for help? Do it before they get trigger-happy, Mo. Salam Alaikum. - Ismail Rabbani. - Heh-heh. My friend, your face is all over the news. - Ah. - Good to see you. Been too long. This is, uh, Mohammed. Asalamualaikum. Wa-alaikum-salam. So what brings you to Farah? We have to get to Kandahar. Oh, if you'd only come by yesterday, I would have flown you myself. Well, the Taliban borrow my helicopter for operation in the north. Hm. I can give you a truck. I have plenty of those. You will be there in three hours. - My brother. - We are about to eat. Are you hungry? Our morning's work. Sure had some good times together, huh, facing them Osama's boys. Yeah, we gave them a run for their money. That's for sure. Feels like a lifetime ago, but don't worry, soon we will be all back at it again. The harder you try to stamp out an ideology, the stronger it becomes. Hm? Hm. What is with the good Muslim boy? Ah. Mo... what are you doing? Your friend is a warlord who razed Herat. It was only business. A higher bidder paid me for it. And I will do it again just like I did for the Russians, I did it for ISI. I did it for Americans and I will do it for Taliban. You killed thousands. Women and children. One of them was my son. Ismail, well... Is that what you want? Huh? Is that it, revenge? An eye for an eye? Hm. Here, take it. It is only fair. A violent act must be met with another. Go ahead. Take it. Ismail, come on. Stay out of it, Tom. Hm. Ever hear the story of the Afghan man who lived for 700 years? On his 700th birthday, the great Amir, Dost Mohammad Khan, threw him a, a lavish party. And after all the guests had left, the Amir said in confidence, "I am surrounded by enemies." "What is your secret to be living in such dangerous place for a long time?" And the man looked at him and said... "It is easy. Change sides." I know the story. And this way, our country can never be as one. Mo. Ismail. Oh. I... I'm so sorry, Mo. I... I had no idea. You called him your brother. Do you know how insulting this? He killed my son and thousands more because of you and people like you empowering him without caring about my people! Shame on you. Shame on you. Look, we can refuse his help and we just walk out of here. You wanna do that, I'm in. Oh. I just want to go. I want to go to my family. That's it. I just want to go home. Mo, this is our best chance. Asalamualaikum. Behenchod. Hello? London. Paris. Did you think that this will ever end? Ancient wars were fought for spoils. Modern wars aren't meant to be won. Tom! Fucking Ismail. You should have shot him. I need air support now. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Rasoul, don't be a bitch. Hold them off until I get there. Rasoul. Ah! Hit the gate! Hit the gate! Allahu-Akbar! Hello, Thomas. Oh, fuck you. - It's not funny. Ah. - You okay? What happened? How did you get here, man? Rode in with my Afghan. Special Forces buddies, pretending to be ISIS. - Uh, pretty good, huh? - Oh, fuck. Hey, wait, wait, wait. What about Mo? He's in here somewhere. Let's go find him. Mo? Mo? Mo? Mo? Uh... Oh. Motherfucker! Roman, in here. You okay? I got you, Mo. I got you. Jesus. I'm sorry, Mo. Come on. You get up. Out of here. Out of here. Almost there. Hang on... Ah. What about your SF guys? Can we get them out? They are never gonna stop fighting. Sir, there they are. Moving in with Reaper. Confirming signal from town's blue force. This guy doesn't quit. No, he doesn't. Stay on the fence line. There's a perimeter gate four klicks up. He's right on our ass. Ah! Ah! Everybody okay? Mo, good? Ah, it's Roman. Oh, my God! - Shit. - Ah. - Roman. - He's bleeding very badly. Mo, find something to pack him with. Quick. It's alright. It's alright. Roman, just hang on, okay? We're gonna make it to the flight. - Roman! - No, Roman! Tom, we have to go back. Alright, Mo. Get ready. Ah. Hang on, Mo. Almost there! - We are not gonna make it, Tom. - We're gonna make it. Copy, Bravo Six. Prepare for landing. Multiple bogies emerging from the north and east. RPG's spotted on the left window. ETA on the Brit slide is one minute. Christ, they're gonna block the gate. Tell the birds to hold the plane. Copy. Roger, Bravo Six. Move your best to hold. However, we have targeted civilian... Come, let's go, boys. I see the gate. - Hm? - Tom? Stay here. He is going to kill you. Then I won't be lying down. Fuck. I've got you. I got you. Huh. Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Mo. I let you down. God's plan. God's plan? Counting up to 50-plus bogies converging on the base. What's our Reaper armed with? She'd be using Hellfire, sir. Text the pilot. Do it now. What are you doing? We don't have the authority. Fuck the authority. They can fire me. I won't watch anymore of our men die today. Tom... it's been an honor. Be honest, mate. Let's go home, Mo. Let's go. Go! Quick. Come on. Ah. Ah. We got wounded! We got wounded! Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. - Get a medic on it. - Go! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! I will never see my homeland again. Yes, you will. And I'll be with you... when you find your wife's sister. Oh. You may go. I am glad you called. The Brits want to know what happened to the reporter. When I captured that Mossad agent in Tehran last year, I told him a simple truth. Spend too much time in Tehran, and Israel was cease to exist. He took it as a threat. But it was just some friendly advice, from one countryman to another. You have to return home... to know what you are fighting for. - Hey. - Hey. You're home. What happened? Nothing. Ah. Well, you get so big. Dad, you don't tell your teenage daughter she's getting big. Well... Well, you know what I mean. Hm.
