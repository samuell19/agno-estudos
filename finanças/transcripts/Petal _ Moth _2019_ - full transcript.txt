I dreamed I was water flowing free I spread myself wide and deep so I could hold all that needed to be held and then they came... Some crashed straight through laughing, screaming always in numbers always in light they played on and under in, and with me and I split the sun into color because it was so good not to be alone. Others walked only beside but close as if the touch was there thinkers thinking strugglers struggling with the coldness of life with the coldness of me comforted by the nearness and the separation too. Some simply entered without asking without words graceful limbs swirling I let them in and we made love two bodies moving in a slow motion world a wave crashing on the shore. Then there were the tender ones the broken ones the ones who carried pain in their pocket hidden in stones they came to me to set it free wept all of it right into me because they understood my vastness and they needed to breathe again. Then the curious the bold the searchers of treasure of hidden things those whispered to by secrets seduced by gold they brought their shovels so they could dig deep if they only knew how much was buried within me. And one other a familiar one one who entered slowly arms spread in surrender or embrace I wrapped myself around myself like a mother like a child gently moved beneath immersed myself in blue... I closed my eyes and dreamed a dream that I became water. ♪ You were talking ♪ ♪ Over and over ♪ ♪ I heard the passion a slight distraction ♪ ♪ Accidents happen ♪ ♪ It's one in a million ♪ Two in a billion ♪ I've got seven ♪ Let's get this straight you could never relate ♪ ♪ And I got something to say ♪ Your book's out of date ♪ It can't relate ♪ Kneeling was never my place ♪ I've been outside myself ♪ Outside myself... ♪ I love all of the blue. - Hmm... - It looks like water. - It does. - Amazing isn't it? - Oh, you scared me. Sorry. - It's okay. - You walked by here yesterday, right? - Yeah... Yeah, I came to see the tide actually. - Did you catch it? - Nope, not yesterday. - So is this your first time? - Uh huh. You picked a great day for it. - It's the solstice. - Oh... I haven't been keeping track of the days. It all happens anyway, whether we're paying attention or not. Yup, it does. - So is it what you expected? - The bore? Yeah I guess, yes and no. I was expecting it to be pretty impressive, but... I wasn't really expecting to feel as much as I did - when it went by it was like... - It's pretty powerful stuff. - Yeah. - We're one of the only places in the world - where the tide comes in like this. - Oh yeah? Yeah, it's not the biggest, but it's the highest. The river rises about twenty five feet in an hour. Wow. That is impressive. Yeah the tourists love it. It's a pretty big draw. - So you're an artist. - I am. I saw you working on something yesterday, at the gazebo. Ohh... I didn't think you saw me. You walk really fast. I guess I was in a little bit of a rush. To get to something or... get away from something? Hmm... I don't know, maybe a little bit of both? - Huh. - Yeah. - So you're into art? - Yeah. Yeah I love it actually. - Do you paint? - No. - Sculpt? - Uh uh. - Pottery? No. - Basket weaving? - No. You do something, you definitely have that vibe. I really wish I could help you. Ahh... Are you a musician? You're a musician aren't you. I was a musician actually. Yeah I... I don't really play anymore though. You can't really unmusician yourself. I knew you were an artist. - I'm David. - Oh, Lily. Petal actually, nobody really calls me Lily. - Petal? - Yeah. It's a term of endearment in England, my grandmother's from there. She said it was too perfect that I was named after a flower. Lily, Petal... - I don't know, it just kind of stuck over the years. - It's cute. - Thank you. - Petal... - Yeah, like P E T A L - Petal. - It's really beautiful. - Thanks. - So did you finish your piece? - Almost. - I took a break to come catch the wave. A good reason to take a break. I should probably get back though. Do you wanna... Wanna come see it? - Yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah, I'd like that actually. Come on. - Thank you. Oh wow... - They're really pretty. - The sun came out just in time. Uh huh. - You can touch them if you want. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I love that you use CDs. - Thanks. - I use them in my art a lot actually. - Uh huh? This is a really simple piece. That's why I like it. You get to really appreciate the CDs... how they reflect light, ...create sound. There's sound on them too. - Yeah... - PETAL: Every single one? - They all have music. That's crazy. Crazy, crazy... It's like each one has a secret. It isn't obvious that they make sound on their own when you see it like this, because it's part of something else that's creating sound. People are usually really surprised when they find out you can actually play them. If I haven't drilled too many holes, or, covered them in paint. The music that's on here doesn't ever change cause it's burnt onto the CDs, but the sound of all of this is always changing. - I like that juxtaposition. - Hmm... But... People mostly like that they're really pretty. That's because they are really pretty. Thank you. It's a great concept, sound creating sound. - Very clever. - That sounds like something a musician would say. Oh... So what kind of music is on here? Some of my own stuff, actually. You write music too. You're a musician. - Guilty as charged. - I'm very impressed. And now I really want to hear what's on these. Cool, thank you. - Yeah. So that's the name of the song? No that's me. Well, sort of. It's... - it's an alter ego thing. - Like a Bowie thing? Yeah. Here... if you want to share your impressions. Cool. Thank you. You're welcome. I probably should get going. Yeah. But thank you. For the music, for the tour... My pleasure. - Yeah it's been really nice talking to you. - You too. - Have a nice day. - Thanks, you too. - Okay, bye. Good-bye Petal, who was and is a musician. Cool eh? - HANNAH: Yeah... - Do you like? - I do... I love how the light hits it, so many colors... - It's like a rainbow. - It's like Christmas for you. Hello. - Hello... - I seem to have a habit of sneaking up on you. This is David. Actually this is his, he made this. - Very nice. - We met yesterday. - HANNAH: I like it. - This is my cousin Hannah. - Hello cousin Hannah. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Have we met before? - I don't think so. - You look really familiar. She's an artist as well actually. - Yeah, super talented. - Stop it, you make me blush. - Hannah...? - HANNAH: Gale. - Hannah Gale? - Oh my god, you're Hannah Gale?! - I am. I knew you looked familiar. - I saw your exhibit last year, the one with the light bulbs? - Yeah. Like you actually made light appear with the paint. Or in the paint. I don't know how you do it but it's amazing. - I'm really glad you liked it. - I was hoping to meet you and talk shop a little bit but I completely missed the opening. I caught the exhibit a few days later. Well, you can always come by the studio sometime, I can give you a tour. - Seriously? - Yeah, what are you doing, uh, tomorrow? - I'm free. - You're free? - I am free. - You can have lunch maybe, with Petal and I? - Wow! Yes, I will definitely come have lunch with you. - I'll come have lunch with both of you. - Here's my card. The address is on there and everything else you'll need. Hannah Gale. Phew... Thank you so much, for the food, the conversation, I loved it. - I should go clean up. - Yup. - Nice to see you. You too. - Take your time. - I will. I'll be in in a few minutes, okay? No rush. - Okay. It was really nice spending time with both of you. - It was a really nice afternoon. - It was. - How about another one? - Another what? - Really nice afternoon. - Maybe. I'm free tomorrow. - So, how about tomorrow? - Tomorrow could work. - I'll pick you up at noon? Okay. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey! - Hello. - Careful, your head. Oh, okay. Thanks. Beautiful afternoon eh. - Yeah. - There's a few places by the river I'd like to show you. - Okay. - Sound good? - Sounds really good. ♪♪♪ ♪ Sittin' in the shade of an apple tree ♪ ♪ Waitin' for my baby to come sit by me ♪ ♪ Lonesome for so long, it's away she's gone ♪ ♪ Off to fight for liberty ♪ Grew up side by side and we fell in love ♪ ♪ And we built a little home we were dreamin' of ♪ ♪ Papers came and she had to fly ♪ ♪ Come back to me baby, baby bye-bye ♪ ♪ Well before my baby left she made this promise ♪ ♪ I'll be with you forever and always ♪ ♪ This apple tree will grow and thrive ♪ ♪ That's how you'll know I'm still alive ♪ ♪ Grew up side by side and we fell in love ♪ ♪ And we built a little home we were dreamin' of ♪ ♪ Papers came and she had to fly ♪ ♪ Come back to me baby, baby bye-bye ♪ ♪ Many seasons have passed and I await ♪ ♪ The return of my baby 'til the night gets late ♪ ♪ Sittin' and a wonderin' where she could be ♪ ♪ Underneath this dyin' apple tree ♪ ♪ Grew up side by side and we fell in love ♪ ♪ And we built a little home we were dreamin' of ♪ ♪ Papers came and she had to fly ♪ ♪ Come back to me baby, baby bye-bye ♪ ♪ Grew up side by side and we fell in love ♪ ♪ And we built a little home we were dreamin' of ♪ ♪ Papers came and she had to fly ♪ ♪ Come back to me baby ♪ Baby bye-bye ♪ Woo woo! Thank you! - BUSKER: Thanks. There, I'm in focus. See anything cool? The water's really calm. It looks so different from when the tide comes in. It's beautiful though. - Kind of makes you feel calm doesn't it? Yeah, I feel like I could stay here all day. Ohh... The river's not that way. The river's that way. - I actually know of a really cool spot. - Uh huh? It's along the river. It's my favorite. - Oh yeah? - Nobody really knows about it. - Really? - I feel like I want to show you. - Hmm, then I'll know about it. - Yeah you will, and you can show all your friends. - Okay. When do you want to go? - Now? - Yeah let's go now. Come on. Okay, cool. - Are you staying long? - At Hannah's? Yeah... For a while I think. How long? - Probably for the summer. - The whole summer? - Yeah, I think so. - That's a great vacation. Yeah. - You don't sound convinced. - No it's good... It's just, I guess, not really, a typical vacation. - No? - I've been taking some time off. It's a long story. I happen to like long stories. Well this is a sad one. Oh, sorry. - Well I'm a good listener. - Uh huh? If you happen to want to share your long sad stories. I'm a really good listener. Yeah I just, I haven't really told many people. So it's a bit... hard to get out. I get that. There was someone... not too long ago in my life. A musician actually. We used to play together. We used to be together. Mmm... There was a consequence... from that. And he didn't want to have anything to do with it so he left as soon as he found out. And... about two months after that... I lost a baby. And then I proceeded to lose my mind. Oh I'm sorry. You don't, you don't have to tell me this. It's okay. I feel like I want to tell you. So... Yeah, it was a mess, I was a mess, I was having a really hard time just getting through my days. And then Hannah called, as soon as she found out and she invited me to come and stay here with her for awhile, just to get away. That's why I'm here. She said that she thought it would help me to be surrounded by beauty. I think she was talking about her art. That's so Hannah. But I don't think she realizes that that's not... what the most beautiful thing is to me, at her place. I love what she does, don't get me wrong but I just think the most beautiful thing there is Hannah. - Aw... I can, I can definitely see that. - Yeah. So... I wasn't always like this. Like what? So I'm usually quite open, but it's hard for me to let people in now. Like, pretty text book stuff. I'm a bit of a cliché I guess, I have trust issues with men. Sorry... I didn't mean that like that. I know I don't know you that well but I feel like I can trust you for some reason. Ahh... It's kind of scary but... You seem different. I am. And that's my story. Thank you. Aww... Thank you. - What? - There's something I want to give you. - Huh? - Close your eyes. - Okay. And give me your hand. What are you doing? - What is this? - Okay open. Ahh! It's really pretty, what is it? - It's hematite. It supposedly has the power to absorb negative energy. Thank you. That's very thoughtful. - Hang on. - There's more? It's a magnet? - Uh huh, they're magnetic too. - Cool... Which I love... - You like magnets? Yeah. I'm weird. I'm a bit of a collector of things. Weird things. - Like magnets. - Like magnets. I love tape too. - Tape? Duct tape... Masking tape... I have it in all sizes and colors imaginable. - Sounds like a lot of tape. - Oh, and flashlights! I love flashlights. I make them too. - Really? - Uh huh. That's where the tape comes in handy. That's very cool. - I like that. - Do you? - Uh huh. Yeah, you do your own thing. That's cool. That's always cool. - Not everyone gets that. - I get it. I do. Everybody's a little bit weird. Everybody's... - You seem pretty normal. - That's cause you don't know me that well yet. Okay then, tell me something weird about you. Ahh... well there are a few things but, um... - I rescue bugs. - You do not! - I do. I totally do, I do. I actually pick them up and rescue them. I rescue worms that get stuck in the gravel - and I flip June bugs over so they can fly away. - You're crazy... Nah, I do... Well I don't, like, I flip them and I get out of there. - I don't wait for them to like, land on me. - Seriously? Yeah, I want them to have their little life. - I like that. - Yeah, me too. - I told you I was weird. - You're totally weird. - I know... - It's awesome. - I know. Thanks. I love eating with people. - I love eating with people. - You do? Yeah. We're uh, we're a little boring aren't we, - with our chocolate and vanilla. - I don't know... I think it's maybe my favorite combo. - Yeah? - The two, yeah. Uh huh. Well here, have a bite of mine, I'll have bite of yours... - Cause we're gonna share? - Uh huh. - Aw, we're nice. - Same time too. - Okay. And now, combine it... Ohh! - Cheers! - Mmm... - I really want to show you the property I'm staying at. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Sounds cool. - Yeah sweet. - Okay. - I'll call you. Okay. Bye. Thank you. - Good morning! - HANNAH: Good morning... - How did you sleep? - Not great actually. - No? - No, I had a weird dream. Ohh... Was it scary?! - No, it wasn't scary. It was just... weird. What happened? Well, I dreamt I was swimming in a river. A beautiful flowing river. It was dark, but the moon was full, and it was shining on the water so I could see right through to the bottom. The water was perfectly clear and it was warm, and I felt so graceful. But then, it started to feel cold, and the water got thicker, and thicker, and I started to have a hard time moving in it. When I looked in... all the water was turning into paint. - All of the water was turning into paint. - That does sound scary! I didn't feel scared. Actually I felt sad. - Aw... - Yeah, I just felt really, really sad. - Don't feel sad. - I'm okay. It was just a dream. - A weird artist's dream. - Yeah, very weird. - It's beautiful here! Oh my goodness. - Ahh, I know. - I'm such a fortunate man. - You are. - I get to stay here for free actually, and all I have to do is help out with the property. - Cool, what do you do? - I mostly just cut the grass. - There's, there's a lot of grass! - There is a lot of grass. - But it's worth it, you can't go wrong. - I think it's a good deal. - So, we have our main cabin here. - Uh huh. We have our smaller cabin here. And there's a really small one behind the trees over there. - That's where I usually stay. - Ahh, you like to stay among the trees? Oh I love it, love it, love it... Sometimes I'll actually sleep in a tent beside my cabin. If I had it my way actually I'd, I'd sleep under the comfort of the stars - every evening. - Except for maybe this? - Yes... - We're a little bit hindered by the bugs. - I know. It wasn't smart for me to wear sandals. I'm just gonna... - Ah! They'll be vampires. - Ahh! They're awful. Well, here, get on my back. - Why?! - Oh come on, get on my back, I'll bring you to safety. - Seriously? - Come on, come on. - I'm heavy... Ahh! - Ohh, where are you taking me?! - That cabin there... - Ahh... - DAVID: looks empty, I think... - You think? - What does that mean? - Well, there's a story. Uh oh... - A long time ago... - Ahh... - there was a boy... - I don't like where this is going. - Down by the river... - Oh god, there's a river too. - At the end of the property... - Uh huh? - There was an accident. - Oh no... Seriously, is this a true story? Ohh yes. - I don't like it. Don't worry Petal... Sometimes he just comes here to sleep. No! I don't want to go in! Come on... - PETAL: Ahh! Put me down! Put me down... Oh... Are you sure we're alone in here? I think... I'm pretty sure I'm a lot older than you are. I'm pretty sure I don't care. I'm not gonna hurt you. Uh... I'm not ready... I'm not ready. Sorry. I'll go slower. - No... - You okay? - - It's okay. We don't have to rush anything. - Petal... Look at me, look at me. - I can't... Petal... Come on, come on, it's okay, come here. Come on, don't worry. I'm not okay... It's okay. Come on, come on... Come on, let's get up. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's okay... It's okay Petal. It's going to be okay. Is this okay? Am I too close? You're not close enough. I want to crawl inside of you. You wreck me... You wreck me. - It's like colors you can eat. - Ooh yeah... Hannah would love that. - All the colors of the rainbow. - So pretty... Do you think she'd be okay with you here, eating jelly beans with me? No, not at all! There's too much sugar, she's a health freak. - Oh yeah? - Unless there's like a kale flavored one. I don't know, maybe that green one. Do you think it's kale? - Well how about you try that green one first. - No! I wanna try this pink one. Is there anything healthy that's naturally pink? Umm... - This jelly bean. Let's try it out. - Okay. - Oh that's really good. - What does it taste like? Umm... Maybe like a strawberry smoothie? - Mmm... - Super yum. - Do you want to feed me one? Okay. I'm just gonna randomly pick one. Oh oh, these are a mystery, it's white. - Alright let's try it out. - Wait, you have to guess. It could be mint... - Coconut. - It could be mint, it could be coconut, it could be vanilla... it could be... snow. Coconut mint. Vanilla snow. Mmm... - What is it? Mmm... - PETAL: Aha... Ohh... Thank you! - PETAL: You're welcome. Okay, I'm gonna go for this orange one. - Guess the flavor? - Umm... - Tangerine. - Peach. You win. Uh huh. That one's pretty... - Mmm... - What is it? - You gotta try that one! - What is it? - Blue raspberry. - There's no such thing as a blue raspberry. - Uh huh, let's find out. Ahh... - There's one left! - Oh oh... I got an idea. - So, we're gonna do a contest. - Okay. We're gonna stare at the jelly bean... And the first one who blinks... - Doesn't get to eat it. - Okay. Wait... - Mmm... - And three, two, one... Go! Ahh...! You win. Thank you... - This time. - That's okay. Aww... Mmm... - I'm good at sharing. - Thank you... - for everything. - It's very good. Thank you. No I mean really, thank you. Uh huh, of course. Like thank you for having me over again. Why wouldn't I have you over again? - You know I'm a good guy. - Uh huh. - I don't like screwing around or anything. Or playing games. I know. - I care about you. - I appreciate you. - Thank you. Okay... - Okay. - Okay. Okay. - You win the prize... - Aww... You're a sweetheart. For being the nicest guy in the tent. - The only guy in the tent. - Aw... Thank you. Mmm... You're cute. - Raspberry? - Yup. Let me drop it. - You don't trust me. - No... it's just I really wanted that raspberry. - You have really pretty hair. - You think so? - Uh huh. Turn around... Turn around. - Alright. - I'm gonna take out this elastic... This is so pretty, this little bit of blond. - Do you like it? - Yeah, did you put that in there? - Nope. - No...? - My parents did. What does that mean? - It's a birthmark. - In your hair? - Yeah. - Seriously... - Loads of teasing when I was a kid. Aw... It didn't help that I was one of the taller ones in the class either. Oh... They used to ask me if I painted the ceilings. That is not very original. They got even more creative in high school. They'd ask... if the carpet matched the curtains. Am I supposed to know what that means? Think about it. - Ohh... Sorry, - There we go, there we go... - little delayed reaction. - Just a bit. - That's pretty mean. So does it? - Huh? - Match the curtains. You're funny. - I guess you'll have to find out. - Ohh... Touché. - Here, try and throw one in my mouth. - Oh that is not a good idea. Yes it is, come on. - Ah... Oh! - Woo! Score! - Mmm... Mwah mwah... C'est la vie. - You have a really nice voice. - Thank you. Do you sing? - Umm... I did, yeah, that's what I did actually, when I used to play, I mostly sang. Now... not so much. - No? - No. We should play music together sometime. Do a bit of singing, maybe... write a song? - Maybe. - If, if you want to. - Yeah, no, sometime maybe. Yeah, sometime. Just not... - yeah, not right now. - Oh. - But sometime. - I understand. - Yeah. - Sorry. But you can sing, you can keep singing. Sounds great. Ha ha... - DAVID: Woo... Ohh... Is it good? Sometimes gaps in clouds reveal chance stars, sometimes the moon, near or far, shines through, and the clouds fringes become transparent, wispy, moon singed, the way your voice enters my dream, through the noise and the chatter, earth, sky, cloud, moon, solid matter, I feel the power, the lure of you, like a shower of butterflies. Strong... - Hold open your hand. Careful, it's heavy. - Uh huh... - Let me help you actually. - Okay. And then I want you to take your mallet, - and just hit it to hear what it sounds like. - Okay. Strong eh? - Uh huh. - And I'll help you out to start off. Okay. Nice and slow... Really feel the vibration it's creating. And we can make the sound stronger if we go a little faster. Perfect. - See if you can do it by yourself. - Ahh... - You can, I trust you, I trust you. - Okay, okay, okay... Like that? - Like that? - That's perfect. See if you can hold it yourself too. There we go, leap of faith, leap of faith. You got this. - See, it's not that hard. - Uh uh. - You look happy. - I know, it's weird. - So, how is he? - David? - Uh huh. - He's good. - Uh huh? - Uh huh. - That's nice. - It's really nice. - How nice exactly? - Nice, just nice. Uh huh...? So... you thinkin' about it? I'm thinking about it. I'm just... I'm just thinking about it but, I don't know. I'm sorry. I just want to make sure you're okay. - I'm okay. - Good, good. - Yeah. I don't know. You'll know. Here comes the fun part... Uhh... - You wanna? - Me? - Of course. Ohh, I don't know... - It's just paint. - Yeah? - Absolutely. - You just lift and let go. - Lift and let go? - Lift and let go. - Alright... - Wanna do a countdown? - Three, two, one... Ahh... It's amazing. - Beautiful. - There you go. Wow... Do you ever feel like everything is upside down, like the ground is the sky and the sky is the ground. Sometimes, but I think the sky is the sea. I feel like I'm falling down... I'm falling all the way down to the ground. And I'm falling into the sea. Do you think there's good food there, if you had to stay under the water, do you think the food would be good there, or would you just get to eat fish? I think the food would be incredible. I think there would be everything that we have on land but it would all taste much better under water because of the salt. Everything tastes so much better with salt. Salted caramel underwater ice cream... Mmm... It would melt and mix in the water like a lava lamp. I want to go under water with you and eat salty psychedelic ice cream. Anytime, you just have to fall into the sea with me. I'll fall fall fall into the sea with you... and you can fall into the sky with me. - Oh yeah, I have a surprise for you. - Does it involve salt? No. There's a festival coming up. I'm involved in it. - Oh, wow. - That's not the surprise though. The surprise will be at the festival. You have to come to get it. - When is it? - Last Friday of the month. Last Friday...? Oh no... I think that's the night of the party. - What party? - It's an anniversary party, people in the art world, I'm Hannah's date. - Oh... - Yeah, she doesn't even really like that sort of thing but they're really big supporters of her work and they're... really well connected. It's a great opportunity for her. I promised I'd go. I don't want to back out on her, she's been so good to me. Could you leave her for just a little while? - I only need you for a few minutes. - Let me talk to her. If she doesn't mind, I'll try to duck out of the party for a few minutes, okay? - A few secret minutes. - Thank you Petal, - who lives in the sky. - Ahh... Are you gonna be taking me into the sea?

I really enjoyed the exhibit, I love your work. - Thank you, thank you so much. - What style is that? It's actually something new I've been playing with. It's called fluid acrylic. Yeah, I'm enjoying it a lot actually, because it's absolutely unpredictable. It's quite challenging but really really fun. That's so interesting. My daughter actually does some painting now. - Oh really, what type? - Ahh, mostly watercolor. - Nice, have you been at it for very long? - Ahh, about two years now. Okay. Any exhibits on the way? - Oh god no, I just do a portrait here and there. - Oh, that's pretty challenging. I'm sorry, excuse me, it's just that we want to catch up with somebody over here. - Absolutely, absolutely. - It's been wonderful chatting with you. - Have a good night. - Same here.
