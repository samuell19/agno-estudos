This movie has been filmed in Mojacar (Almería) and Aguilas (Murcia). We express our sincere gratitude to the authorities and the people in both cities. This is the place where I live, the one that I've chosen. And this is my town, one of the most beautiful places in Spain. THE PALACE My name is Antonio Jaime Moraleda de los Enhebros. Marqués de Altuna. Tony for my closest friends. I settled down here, in this special region of the beautiful Mediterranean sea to escape from the mob and the vulgarity of the people in Spain. I have some businesses here. They keep me busy and allow me to meet people from different social classes. Sometimes they're very interesting. This is how I met Emmanuelle. She was on vacation here, enjoying a new honeymoon with her husband. They'd been a long time apart because of the many lovers and flings she had. But the man, who was a diplomat of the highest social class and of great nobility, ended up forgiving her. They rented a nice house not very far from my town. I already call this place my town. And for a while, they lived a passionate love story. You'd always see them together, like two teenagers who've just fallen in love. WAX MUSEUM - This is Mae West. Look at her! - She looks thinner. - The Man of la Mancha. - Don Quixote. Two tickets. Two hundred. Thank you! Let's go. Flash Gordon! Oh no, it's Superman. What a nice little ass! It sure looks tempting! Shut up, pervert! Look! Elvis, poor guy! I loved him. Liza Minnelli in Cabaret. Look who's there! The most attractive man in the world! Farewell, my baby! As of tomorrow, I'll wear a hat and a raincoat. You're going to look like a clown. Then, I'll take them off to make love to you. - Very well, Mr. Bogart. - Thanks, honey. What do you think of her? Who do you like the most? Greta Garbo or Liza Minnelli? Well, they don't have anything in common, but I like Liza Minnelli much more. And, what do you think Bogart would say in this situation? I'm gonna kiss you, baby! What are you doing? Are you nuts? They're all looking at us. You're crazy. I'm crazy for you. I'm going to rape you right now! You're crazy! Someone might come any minute! We'll remain still, and they'll think that we are a porno monument. - You're crazy! - I'm horny! How exciting! We'll fuck in front of all these famous people. You're crazy. Do you already have it hard? - Let me see. - Fuck me! John Wayne is looking at us! He doesn't seem to be enjoying it. Sure, he does! He'd like to be right here! I'm sure that Liz Taylor would like to be in my place right now! I don't think Richard Burton would let her do it. He's a very jealous guy! As jealous as I am. What would Humphrey Bogart say about us? Nothing. He never paid attention to these things. Like the old Chaplin, who loved all the people so much. Or like her. They should think it's great for us to be making love here. Dracula, instead, is very shocked! It's been a long time since I cared about the opinion of monsters. They are all very hypocritical. There you go, that's it, honey! Did you hear that? It's them, but don't worry. Don't you know them already? There are so many of them in the world. They envy our love. This is wonderful, we're out of our minds. Emmanuelle and Andreas walked through the typical and white streets of our towns. They discovered in each corner a reason for a new kiss. Something to remember... I lived that romantic fever a long time ago. Even though I'm young, I learned from the elderly to always have good manners, be modest and respectful. These were, up to recently, the virtues of our glorious race. The excessive contact with foreigners has been the cause of some of our miseries. You can't reach me! Come on, run, run, run! Come on, come get me! Ey, you can't run! Come on! - Can you give us $5? - What for? For an ice cream. - Here. - Here. - And you. - Thank you very much! Come on! Come get me! Run! It was precisely in one of the places that I run in the coast where Emmanuelle and her husband had a terrible row. It's a disco, always full of those crazy hip hop dancers. I've also included an act with some gorgeous girl dancers, to attract a more mature clientele. They're the ones who purchase 3 or 4 drinks a night, instead of the cheap sodas that the young ones purchase. Once, I earned $80,000 in two hours with a table of friends who were my age. And the place was full of assholes, who weren't even able to raise that amount of money. Anyway, that Friday the club was really crowded. Emmanuelle and Andreas, her husband, were right there, at the bar. Carmen, a happy widow with lesbian tendencies, was there with them for obvious reasons. Emmanuelle had had too many drinks and the other two as well, but they seemed less drunk. They spent $24,000 pesetas in drinks in two hours. Do you like her? That depends. I wouldn't marry her, that's for sure! Show me your tits, María! That's disgusting! Does anyone want to come here with me? You come down here! And we'll give you what you want! Does anyone want to come and try my pussy? - Why don't you go? - I don't want to. Are you crazy? Come on! No one wants to come here with me? - Why don't you go? - I don't want to. - I'll go then. - Where are you going? Come here. Let me go! I'm going! I'm going! Come here! Please, I'm very horny! - Here I am. Thank you, honey. - Where are the men? - We don't need them. Bravo, women! Come here, I'm so wet! Easy, easy! Attention, please! You love me, you don't love me, you love me, you don't love me... You love me. - We can't see anything! - Let us see! Let us see! Eat her, blondie! Don't worry! She's just drunk! Yes, that's it, slut! What a nice fuck, girls! That's how you eat a pussy! Now is your turn, man! I don't do it with lesbians. That meant a new break-up for the couple. These modern girls are incredible. I recognize that with those eyes, and her social status, she shouldn't have any money issues. But humiliating Andreas like that, and in public. Treating a noble man like a fool... You shouldn't do that. What's wrong with you? I'm thinking in what you've just done. Because of you, they broke up. I had a great time. What are you doing? Get off my shoulder, you are going to spoil my suit! Hey, waiter! A double rum. She did exactly what she wasn't supposed to. She went to Carmen's house. Maybe deep inside, the experience in the club had opened up new horizons for her. Or maybe she had always been a lesbian. A lot of women today, deprived of moral and religious principles, engage themselves in those forbidden romances. Poor men! What's gonna happen to us? We're not throwing ourselves to new sex practices or experiences! Women with women! I try to adapt to these changes. To be liberal about it. But there are certain things that make me sick. Oh! It's you. I fell asleep while I was waiting for you. - Your husband is gone. - What? Where? - I don't know. - Why? - After what happened last night... - Yes, last night... I don't know where you've been or with whom, but you are behaving very wildly... After all, Andreas is just a man. Yes, that's true. What are you thinking about? Why did he feel offended? It didn't mean anything. Everything's a problem for him. If you have problems, it's your fault. Forget about men. Women are much more understanding, you fool! How about an affair with a mature woman with a beautiful body? I specialize in sad and lonely girls. You have a beautiful body! - You know what? - No. I'm also sick of men and their balls! Do you think they're so important? Of course not! - Hey, you! I know you! - I don't know. - I know you, right? - I think I've seen you before. Hey, why don't you come to my apartment? I'm offering a private party. No, thank you, no. - Come on, don't be so boring! - Why? Come on, come with me! You won't regret it. I don't feel like going. - Don't make me beg you, come on! - Alright. There you go! Come on in. Here! - Is this your apartment? - Yes. Where are the other guests? Do you think that we need someone else to make a party? Come with me. Come here. Please! I honor the beautiful ladies! Relax, lady, I'm a Spaniard gentleman. He's a very good friend of mine. How are you, Tony? I hope you're not mad because we came to your house. I didn't want to stay in my place in case someone unpleasant showed up. This is your house. Carmen, you already know it. But perhaps this beautiful lady doesn't know that a noble Spaniard is always willing to please the ladies. Thank you, Tony, especially for her. This is Emmanuelle and this is Tony, Marqués de Altuna. This is the kind of woman that I like: with blue eyes, soft skin, and that slim body made of alabaster like an amphora of the ancient Assyrians. And those are the hearts that I like: I like passionate and vibrant hearts, having no restraints when looking for emotions, as prohibited and sinful as they might be, when the feelings prevail. Why don't you join us? Thank you, but I would feel an intruder. Besides, I like to seduce women by myself, even if I have to recite them verses of love, behind bars. Goodbye, Tony. I hope to see you soon. Much to my regret, those images had made me uneasy, and I had no other choice but to get that off my chest with María. Come here, slut! I paid her well, and there were no problems with her, it was as when we were young, and respected our girlfriend and then had fun with the prostitutes in the whorehouse. And that made me realize that even though she didn't deserve it, I had been a gentleman with Emmanuelle. It was quite a lesson she was giving me. Those foreigners should realize that in Spain, the men are the ones who choose, especially the men like me. Slut! Bitch! Son of a bitch! Yes! I love it when you tell me all those nice things! Tell me that you'll never leave me. Never. Never. Yes. It's me. I'll hold, alright. Who's calling, please? Is that you, Andreas? Yes, my love. I want to see you, too. Yes. It's my birthday. At the same place. I'll meet you there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I promise. Those foreigners are very weird. Emmanuelle was in love with Andreas. I persuaded him to call her, although I wouldn't have done it if I were him. But those guys, it is as if they were professional cuckolds. Of course, I must admit that that bitch is very attractive. Perhaps it's the kind of relationship they have. I would like to give her a lesson, to drive her mad in the way that we, the respectable men in Spain, know how to do it. And then, despise her. She's nothing special, after all, and she's more difficult than the others. That's for sure. - Isn't that the English girl? - Yes. She's gorgeous. Let's fuck her, what do you say? That's why they come to Spain, anyway. They are like sex addicts. Come here, bitch! We're gonna have a good time! Easy, relax! Don't move, bitch! Here you are! She likes it! Quiet! She really enjoys fucking, such a slut! Well, Mariano, it's enough. It's my turn now! Come on, get out of there! I wanna fuck her now! Come here! Don't worry. She was looking forward to seeing you. She'll come. I hope so. But I don't think she will. - It's late. I'm leaving. - Wait. - Andreas! - Come with me if you want. Alright. Open up! Open the door, please! Open up! Open the door! Open up! Please! There is nothing like the beaches here in Spain. I have traveled a lot. I've practically been everywhere. But I've never seen anything as beautiful as this. It's from the widow. A toast for the beauty in you. And for love. And for Andreas's lovers. Are you still in love with that man? I'll make you forget him. When a woman meets a Spaniard, she falls head over heals in love. Excuse me. I need to take a pee. I'm sorry María, but you're a whirl of life, of youth. You should be among cheerful people, strong men, tireless lovers. I'm not enough for you. I understand. You're still in love with the French girl. Tell me the truth. Do you still love her? Maybe. You can't stop loving a person like that. You can't decide: "I don't want to love this woman, I want to love this other one". Unfortunately, that's the way it is. I swear I want to forget her. I know there is nothing left between us. Even if she wanted to be with me again, I wouldn't do it. Emmanuelle can't be with only one man. And you? Could you be faithful to just one man? No. Perhaps, the problem is not you, but us. Perhaps we are wrong. We have been brought up with outdated ideas. The couple, the family, the occasional fling. All that will disappear soon. And that will give way to new types of relationships. Maybe, to total freedom in love. Here I am. I'm going to show you how a noble Spaniard makes love. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Did you enjoy it, honey? Yes. A lot. Bravo! Well done! Do you think this is alright? To cheat on me while I'm away. And with Emmanuelle. Well, you can do what you want with her now. No, María, let me explain it to you. Listen... It was just a simple affair. The flesh is weak. I found myself in this situation, and... Do you understand? Get out of my sight! Bye, honey. I have things to do. Look at the French girl. You're a slut. Stop telling me those things, and give me a kiss. I also get out of control when I see your whore's mouth. Watch your head! If you're not careful with the roof, you'll hurt yourself. Come on! Get down here! Andreas. What are you doing? Come on, get down here. I didn't know you were here. Hi. I waited for you all night. I've been waiting for you longer than that. Since the day I missed our date. You must admit that you're getting a little behind. You know that women are always late for everything. Who would have known it? Me, the Marqués de Altuna, worried about those miseries. I didn't care about Emmanuelle and her relationships with men and women. And, as regards María, a slut who shows her body in public. A plebeian. But I couldn't tolerate that she kept on being friends with the couple. What lack of dignity! María, what are you doing here? I also have the right to sleep with whoever I want, don't you think? I also fucked Emmanuelle, what's wrong? The spirit is willing, but the flesh... is weak. Can you see the Marqués? You have lipstick all over your face. If you want, we can make love here, while we watch them. I know your friend, the Marqués, will like it. Your friend, María, won't care if we watch them either, right? Emmanuelle and her husband left the following morning after that shameful adventure. Nobody knows that Marqués de Altuna enjoyed having sex while being watched by another couple. It won't happen again. I admit that Emmanuelle drove me mad. Thanks God, I won't see her again. And I'll forget her. I've forgotten other women who were more important than her. María is still with me. She is not a problem. She's always ready to please me. And whenever I want, I'll send her to jerk off guys as we did with the maids before. I have no feelings for her. She's like Sultán, my dog. Or perhaps she means less to me than my dog, for one simple reason. My dog is a breed dog, and that to us, privileged gentlemen, is important. Very important.
