SF FILM presents in cooperation with a film by Inspired by actual events Since the beginning of the war, the Jews in Denmark have enjoyed a special status. The Germans leave them in peace because of Denmark's coalition policy. But in the autumn of 1943, the coalition falls apart. ACROSS THE WATERS Listen. How well they play. Yes, it's excellent. They almost play better now. - Short sleeves, Christian? - What's wrong with that? No violin note can make up for you wearing your baby brother's jacket. I can actually hear that your sleeves are too short. I can hear it! - It looks cheap! What? - Arne? Hi, Miriam! What are you doing here? They said at Temple that we have to leave Denmark. My parents are at Dragør already. They want us to come with them tonight. - Relax! You're not going anywhere. - I'm talking to my husband! Per is right. We're not going anywhere. Not to Sweden, nor to Dragør. Besides, we have a studio appointment next week. - But they may come for us. - It's just a rumour. Everything's calm in Copenhagen. - It was Marcus Melchior who told us. - What does Marcus Melchior know? This isn't Poland. It's Denmark. These things don't happen here. Don't worry. I was wondering where my son is. Where's Jacob? - Else is looking after him. - Yes! - Play something, guys. - Something slow? Let's get your coat off. "The Moon shone big and pale upon the world so blurred - - and the little nightingale sang to every bird. Girls and boys laid down to rest underneath the starry crest. No one wished to do them harm, everything was nice and calm. All of those sent to writhe in the murky prison - - were freed by the blacksmith, who crushed the evil that had arisen. But the blind Prostrate sat grumbling in his house with the other Darkmen. Oh, how embarrassing for them." Good night. Reading ladies' magazines? There's an interesting article about how people gesticulate. Guess who this is. - I thought you were looking at models. - It's Hitler. This is de Gaulle. - Let's go to bed. - Yes. - Is he asleep? - Yes. He's asleep. - It's very hot in here. - Oh, you think so? Someone's at the door. - Did you invite anyone? - No. Take it easy. - Hello, Else. - They're coming. Who's coming? Miriam! Miriam! Else says the Germans are here! I'll get Jacob! Get the money! The money! - Where is the money?! - In the cupboard! - Sweetie... - Where are we going? To Grandma and Grandad's. Come. - Do you have the money? - Take the back stairs! - Come with us! - Go! Now! Get out. Hurry! - Hurry up. - Coming. Arne... - Have they gone? - Yes. I had to hide in the closet. They wrecked everything. They wrecked everything. Mom, I'm cold. Here, Arne. Help me with the clothes. How much did you manage to grab? 150... 200... 350... 450... How much do you have there? What about in your wallet? - Arne, where's the rest of the money? - That's it. The guitar cost a bit. What were you thinking? And this should get us to Sweden? - We should have gone with my parents. - I'll get us to Sweden! - This is your fault! - Don't... - Relax, calm down. - Are you mad at each other? No, we're not mad at each other. Right? I promise I'll get us to Sweden. We just need to... Kaj! Damn it... let a man know you're staring at him, okay? Master says thanks for the coffee. So you have something nice to drink at the wharf now? How about some for my sister? - Who's that? - Stæhr. He's meeting with me. - Oh? What about? - Don't know. He said it was important. N.B. Glad you could make it. There's a rumour that the Germans are rounding up the Copenhagen Jews. You should expect people who want to cross. I hope your brother-in-law and the other skippers will help. Don't count on it. If they're after the Jews, they'll come here, too. We'll gather the men and talk about it. We risk our lives and our boats. - What if someone rats us out? - I've been saying the same thing. - What's in it for us? - What do you mean? My cousins in Dragør say there's good money in this. What are they charging? - 1500 a head. - Damn. - And those with no money? - In Dragør, the rich pay for the poor. - They can do that here, too. - Not exactly fair, is it? If we can agree to charge what they charge in Dragør, it's not a bad idea. If that's what it takes, I guess that's how it'll have to be. We should get moving. He's running a temperature. We need to find a doctor. There... And again. Good. One more time. What's wrong with him? Nothing serious. He just needs penicillin and rest. Can we buy that from you? I assume you're on the run? Where are you heading? - My parents crossed via Dragør. - Dragør... Copenhagen is full of Gestapo and Schalburg men, so that won't do. What do you suggest? Everyone says that Gilleleje is the safest place. It's in a remote location, and there are no Germans. If it's too dangerous to get to Dragør, how are we going to get to Gilleleje? I know of a driver who's willing to take the chance. - And you'll get some food for the trip. - Thank you. There's no need to thank me. It's the decent thing to do. - Why are you stopping? - Germans up ahead. - Damn it. - Take another road. - There aren't any. - There's got to be at least one. - Grab your things. Go through there. - But you can't just... Walk through the forest! It's a few kilometers to the whistle-stop. The train will take you to Gilleleje. - Walking through... - Then give us back 100 kroner. We'll have to ask for 100 kroner back. We gave you 200 and you only took us halfway there. We need the money. - Driver, we need the 100 kroner! - Arne, come. - You cannot steal our money! - Get out! Miriam, no! Wait! Miriam! Think about your family! Grab him. Teddy! - I want my teddy bear. - Shh, sweetie. Teddy! Stay, Jacob. Don't... Eckhaus? Is anyone in there? No! They're not in here! He's hardly eaten anything. - Is he asleep? - Yes. Too bad that jerk left with my guitar. Yeah... Ah well... Considering our situation, it's probably not that big a deal. Oh, you do see that. But it would be good to have. If we get to Sweden, I could play there. Do you think we'll get there? Yes, I do. If it'll even be necessary. Maybe we can go home in a week or two. We could hide somewhere. Home to what? Our life. Our home. I'm afraid. Come here. Give me the gold around her neck. It's all we have to live on when we get there. If you don't give me the gold you're not going anywhere. Go that way to the harbour and someone will meet you. Come on. Emmet Levi, shoe merchant. My wife and daughter. - We're very grateful for your help. - Do you have the money? - My family in Stockholm will send... - No, no, no. Cash up front. How much do you have? Uhm... we have... We have 200 kroner. Listen... Wait. Wait, please. - We can... - We'll send you the money. - Let go. - We promise! Tell me what to do! Tell me what to do! We have a child! You can't just walk away. Emmet! The constituency has grown, I see. Do you have everything under control? We're transporting them as fast as we can. It'll be fine. I hear they're charging fortunes, and that not everyone can afford it. It's a bit steep. Those who cannot afford it are helped by those that can. I've heard they're turned away if they don't have enough money. - No one is being left behind. - Kjeldgaard is right. They only take those who can pay. That can't be true. Who's rejecting them? Your brother-in-law for one. Do they fit? They're very nice. Kaj. A word? I'm having a drink. Outside. Right now. Have you turned away people who couldn't pay? - Who says that? - Never you mind. Is it true? I don't care what the others do, but you'd better behave! If I ever hear you've rejected people with no money, I'll kick your ass! Do you hear me? Good. We won't talk about it again. What's wrong with him? - Never mind. Everything's fine now. - Good. Niels Børge... If there are people who can't handle the journey, we could help them. I don't understand. What are you saying? If some of them have problems - - tell them we'll mind their children till they return. But it's their children... Yes, of course. Wait. There are people lying over there. Arne, be careful. - Who are you? - Hello. Are you alone? No. I'm with my wife, Miriam, and my son, Jacob. I'm Arne Itkin. Hello. Emmet Levi. This is my wife, Julie, and my daughter, Sarah. We're trying to get to Gilleleje. We just came from there. They only help the wealthy. What? Without money you won't get over. My parents in Sweden have money. You have to have it in your hand or you don't stand a chance. - Arne, what do we do? - We can't turn around now. Don't worry. We'll get there. - I think I've seen you before. - I'm a musician. Yes, a jazz musician, right? Yes. We know the way to Gilleleje. It's five kilometers to the train from here. Would you show the way? If you help us, we'll help you. Yes. Ouch, Dad, it hurts! - Dad, stop! It hurts! - Emmet, let go of her hand. Come on. - Whoa, easy, easy. - Pardon me. Arne... Please keep this safe. Please return my wallet. - What? - You took my wallet! - What? - You took my wallet! - You took my wallet when you fell. - No, I didn't. Give it back. I'm sure of it! He took my wallet! I'm sure of it! I don't have it on me anymore. - I can feel it! - Stop that! You took my wallet! You took my wallet! Emmet... Why did you do that? You can't help me. Who do you think you are? - Emmet! Emmet! - No one can help us! I'm so sorry. He's not quite himself. I don't know what's with him. Emmet? Don't be sad. No... Look at me! Why did you do that? He was going to help us! This is Jørgen. He just came from Copenhagen. We're a group who've started to organise helping people cross over. N.B. handles lodging, Kaj represents the skippers. - And this is Pastor Kjeldgaard. - Hi. Jørgen says there are many refugees on the evening train. We've got it under control. I can't see what use a student would be. Really? I hear you're not transporting everyone. - The skippers are running a huge risk. - Yes, they are. And that's why I bring money from Copenhagen. Will that help? - How many arrive tonight? - I know of 22, but it could be more. - They're not getting over tonight. - What the hell do you mean? - Hey, hey. Calm down. - We can't sail. The wind is too strong. We'll have to put them up in town. It's too risky. People can't help but notice. 22 shouldn't be a problem. - Who's that? - Hans Juhl, SS officer from Elsinore. The bastard should be shot. He's as Danish as you and me, so keep it down. The train is on its way in. We have to stop it before the station. - I need help. - I'll help. Me, too. - I think you got the wrong idea. - I know what this is about. And I want to help. Alright. Let's go get them. Wait here. That's a bit more than 22. We can't put them all up in town. Some must stay at the summer houses. Yes. As many as possible. Wait here. Please stay together and wait over there. Where's Jacob? - I told him to wait here. - Jacob? Have you seen my mummy? - What's her name? - Miriam. Miriam? Jacob? Come here... Thank you. - Can you help us over? - Yes, but no one's sailing tonight. We'll divide you into groups. - My name is Arne Itkin. - Niels Børge. Wait over there please. The first group comes with me. The rest of you wait here. Mummy's right here. There, there, sweetie. Listen... Hello? We're here to bring you to a farm just down the road, where you'll be safe - - and have something to eat. So if you'll come with us? - Come with us. - Come, Jacob. Miriam? Are you coming? Do you need a hand? - How many pupils do you teach? - About 600. - 600? - Yes. Welcome to the chosen people. Miriam, run! It's a trap! Arne! Arne! Stop! Sit down! Jacob... When I tell you to, run as fast as you can through the forest. Quiet! Run, Jacob! Run, Jacob! Run! Come on! Faster! Come on, Jacob! Run! Do you see anything? Jacob? We have to be very quiet. You and I are going back after Mom. Do you understand? Yes. Quiet as a mouse. Come. Stand still. What was that? - Did you hear it, too? - Yes. - Stand still. Stand still. - There it was again. Stand still. I don't hear it anymore. Relax, relax. It's me. Would you like a cigarette? Jacob... Jacob. I will now address matters, I usually do not speak of. I have, like all other pastors - - received a pastoral letter from the Copenhagen Bishop. Wherever there is persecution of Jews for racial or religious reasons - - the Christian Church must protest. The Church must protest because the persecution of Jews - - goes against the humanity and charity - - which is the message, the church of Jesus Christ preaches. Every human life is precious - - in the eyes of God. There is a clear understanding of our duty to remain law-abiding citizens - - who do not go against those who exercise authority over us. But at the same time, our conscience compels us to assert our right - - to protest any and all violations. Regardless of deviant religious views - - we will fight for the right of our Jewish brothers and sisters - - to have the same freedom that we value more than life. Therefore, we explicitly acknowledge - - that we must obey God more than Man. Thank you. Dad? It isn't much farther. And then we'll get something to eat. What have you done, Emmet? What have you done? Come here. Come here... - Name? - Isaac and Rebecca. How much do you have? Here. Safe journey. - How much do you have? - We have no money. You have to help her. She just lost her husband. - What's your name? - My name is Julie Levi. - And the child? - Sarah Levi. And your name? I'll get on the next one. - I'll get on the next one. - Are you sure? Yes. Thank you! I hope you find your husband and child. Come, Sarah. Your name? How many are you? I'm afraid there's no more room. Mr Itkin? I thought they got you. They did. Danish Nazis. - My wife, Miriam... Have you seen her? - She's at the harbour. Come, come. Miriam! Arne! - Mummy! - Arne! Jacob! - The Gestapo are coming! - Run! The Gestapo are coming! Wait for me! Wait for me! Arne, stay there! - Arne! Arne wait... - We have to get away from here. Come on, damn it. Damn it. Get off the boat. Get out! Move! Can't you go any faster? Ten Jews on the boat. The skipper took off. So, no Jews in this town, huh? Denmark is still a democracy. We don't keep an eye on everything. Where are the others? I wouldn't know. Fine. But then I'll take over command of this town. Inspect the harbour and every single cutter! - Now! - Yes, Sir! Do you know how to use that? I was a draftee. - And you? - No, I was rejected. - How old are you, kid? - Six. They're on their way here. May I? Thank you. I apologize for our little intermezzo. I apologize that I cannot offer you coffee. The displeasures of the times. Your men have a slightly better knowledge of the local area than mine. So I need your men to perform a thorough house search of the town. You have assumed control as police authority, correct? Yes. And I'm ordering you to tell your men to take part in the search - - for the Jews, we both know are in this town. - That is prohibited by regulations. - Regulations? What regulations? The agreement between Denmark and Germany concerning German affairs. As you are now in charge - - this is a German affair. And thus you cannot enlist the service of Danish officers. Was that all? Yes. Fine. He's gone. We have to get these two out of here now. I'll bring them to my house. Thank you for helping us. We won't get out tonight. There too many Nazis in town. But I think I know of a place. Let's go. Come. It's up there. Quickly. You must hurry. What are you doing here? I thought you'd taken off. Where would I go? They took my cutter. Come here. Not right now, Kaj. We need to bring food to the church. We have to get out of town, Ellen. - We must go to Sweden. - Sweden? I have money. We'll be comfortable there. - Ellen... - They need help. We must help them. - Ellen... - I'm serious. Let go. Niels Børge and Katrine will take good care of you. They're nice. I'll go find Mom, and then we'll be back for you. Promise? Yes, I promise. Try to get some sleep. - Are you sure my wife's at the church? - Yes. But it's safer to stay here. I cannot leave her there all by herself. Then get rid of the Copenhagen clothes. You can borrow some from me. - I'll go get them. - Thank you. Put this on. It'll be okay. Take this. Would you like an apple? - Aren't there too many of us here? - It's the best we can do right now. - And what if they come? - You're safe here in God's house. - Arne Itkin. His wife is upstairs. - Hello. Thank you. Miriam? Miriam? Arne? Arne? Arne! Arne! Where's Jacob? Did you just leave him? No, no. He's safe. He's being looked after by Niels Børge and his wife. We have to leave. I don't like it here. Relax, calm down. We will. They're working on it. But we have to stay here for now. Everything will be fine. I was so afraid... I was afraid I'd never see you again. What are we going to do? Tickle, tickle, tickle... I just have to tickle, tickle! Tickle, tickle, tickle. The hands just have to tickle, tickle... Oh, no. They keep doing it! Here they come! They're tickling you! Hi. Are you tired, Teddy? Teddy is tired. Let's tuck you in nice and warm. Can't he sleep? He did sleep, but he had a nightmare. The little fella... There's nothing I'd rather give you, you know that, right? Yes. Juhl is preparing to search the town, so we have to get them out now. There are 80 people up there. How will you get that many people out without detection? We have to barricade the church. I don't know how to fight, I'm a pastor. - But the church is the safest place! - Too many people know they're there. We'll take them out in small groups to the summer houses. That's a highly risky plan. - We can use the milk truck. - Yes. For those who cannot walk we'll use a wheelbarrow. I have one in my garage. - We'll use that. - I won't be a part of this. I just won't. Search the boats all over the harbor. We have to find them. When you find them, report it immediately. Understood? - Yes, sir. - Follow me. Well, well, if it isn't the wanted skipper. There are many good people in this town. They'll get us out. Yes. - We'll be happy in Sweden. - Yes. We can go to Stockholm. I can form a new band. A big band. And there are many good schools up there. I'll work hard to get him into one of the best ones. Get out! Everybody out! Get in line! Why is the church all lit up? Someone ratted them out. Damn it. - Is the church surrounded? - All the men are in place. German security police! I know you're in there! Open the door! Again. I order you to open the door. Now! - What will happen with Jacob? - Jacob is safe. Jacob is fine where he is. Why did you come? Now they'll get both of us. Why did you come? Open! Come here. You there! Open the door. Come on! Do it! Open it! - But I... - Do it! But I gave them my word. - I can't... - Get out of my way! The key on the inside is blocking it. You have one minute! Or we throw grenades into the church! Do you hear me? One minute! Miriam... Come. Stand up. Stand up. Miriam, stand up! I have an idea. Over here. Stop, stop. Up here. Jump up. There. Hurry. Up, up. Hold on. 10 seconds. Hurry...! Come on. I'm coming. - All the way up to the spire! - Come. I'll find another place! Continue up the spire! What happened to you? I wasn't the one who ratted them out. It wasn't me. Are you listening to me, Katrine? I'd like you to leave. - It wasn't me... - Leave. I never want to see you again. You're no longer my brother. Get out. That went really well. 83 arrested. I shall praise you gentlemen in my report. Get down. You there! Get down. Jew! Get down from there! You're coming with me. Get in! You threw a good punch. Get out of here. Go. You're a free man. Please let me go. What do you want? Say something... Mrs Itkin? They've gone now. Jacob is with us. He's fine. Wait there. I'll help you down. Hi, sweetie. - Mummy... - Hi. Hi. Where's Dad? Don't ask so many questions, Jacob. We're taking the train. We're going to see Grandma and Granddad. Miriam, do you have a minute? Yes, of course. I'll be right back, okay? I didn't want to say anything in front of Jacob... ... but if it's any help, we can take him. What do you mean? I'm not saying anything will happen - - but Jacob can stay, just in case. If we say he's mine they won't take him. And when you come back... ... you can come pick him up. We're ready to leave. Am I not coming with you, Mum? Of course you are. - Say thank you. - Thank you. Katrine. We're now in Swedish waters. Thank you. After the Gilleleje tragedy, the escape across the Sound was organized better. Over 7000 Danish Jews, 95% of the total, reached safety in Sweden. Shipbroker Niels Børge Lund Ferdinandsen (N.B.) 1921 - 1994 Thank you for all you gave me in life. Miss you.
