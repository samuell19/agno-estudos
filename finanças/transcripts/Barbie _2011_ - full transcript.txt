(Barbie) (Welcome Barbie) Steve? You gained so much weight! So glad to see you! Nice to meet you! - Very, very long time, okay? - Yeah. - Your daughter, Barbie? - Yeah, Barbie. Oh, beautiful! - Follow me. - Okay. Hey, baggage, come on! Welcome to Korea. Shit! Very heavy. Big, big. Hey, sit. Soon Ja, come and have lunch. I don't want to eat. Why not? You already skipped breakfast. I want to be skinny like this doll. But that doll isn't a real human. Why isn't she? Her name is Barbie. Don't you know? Barbie is from America. A pretty and skinny person like that doesn't exist. If she does, then she must be an alien. Wait and see, I'm going to be like her. Dad, let's eat. My daughter Soon Ja likes sausages. My daughter Soon Ja... Dad, eat loads. Soon Ja is playing with an alien. It's my favorite food, sausages. Dad, eat slowly. Oh, come on. What the hell? Damn it. Relax. Holy shit. Fucking car. What do we do? Walking. Shit. - I'm sorry. - Okay. Be careful. Follow me. - Fast! - All right. Damn it. Soon Young! Uncle? Did you have lunch yet? Come here. Who are they? Come and say hi. This is Mr. Steve... He's your new father, Steve. My new father? Didn't your dad tell you about this? No, he didn't. Why did I even expect anything from that dumb-ass? You must be Soon Young. Her hair is yellow. Her eyes are also blue. She's an alien. She's not an alien! She's from America! Stop fooling around and finish your meal. Have this. Are you crazy? That's dog food. Dad, it's not dog food. It's called rice. People eat it every day. Does he look human to you? Is this moron Soon Young's father? Yeah, that stupid guy is Soon Young's father. Dad, I'm hungry. Let's go to the hotel to eat, okay? - Hotel? - Yeah. Oh, right. I have to fix the car. Soon Young, clean the guest house once you're done eating. Wow. That was awesome! Wow, she's pretty. Look at her makeup. Who is she? Stop it! Go! Stop it! Stop it! Who did that? What the heck? Who is she? Come this way! Got it, I'll be there right away! Does he think I'll steal his shitty car? Can you really fix this? Of course. You know, I don't think you should waste any more of my time. Why don't you just call a mechanic? Why the fuck is this Yankee grumbling so much? Relax. Okay? Quench your thirst with a cola. How about mine? I'm as thirsty as this fucking Yankee! No Pepsi, just Coke. Thank you. Get lost. Fuck you. What's that? Thanks! How do you do this? Hold it like this. Pull and then shoot! Thanks! Oh, you can have it. Barbie! Hey, Steve! Here you go. Oh, thank you! What are you doing tonight? Let's go drink and eat together. Korea many, many gorgeous fucking women. No, I didn't come to Korea to get the clap from some whorehouse. Fuck you. - One, oh my god. - Oh my god. Two, oh my goodness. - Oh my goodness. - Why is she so bloody noisy? Hey! - Oh my god. - Listening to that won't improve your English. You have to talk to a Yankee like me! But yours is broken English! What did you say? You fucking bitch. Shut the mouth! Shut the fucking door! Fucking bitch! Big Bro. Sell her when you can. A girl like Soon Young will be a burden in your life. Got it? Here. It's the contract. Sign here. You have a signature, right? Just give me your hand. Scribble anything. I don't want to. What do you mean? I'll give you this sausage if you sign it. Don't you like sausages? Sign the contract. Have you ever seen such a long sausage? No, right? Sign it now. Is he out of his mind? Hey. Hey! Damn it! Open the door! Come on, open it! Shit! Fucking son of a bitch! Welcome! Hi. How much is it? It's 15,000 won. 15,000 won? Why is a guest house so expensive? I'll give you 10,000 won. You have to pay 5,000 won more. You'll get in trouble if you're overcharging me. Take it. My uncle will scold me if I don't receive the right amount. Do you want to get scolded by me? Hello, sir. I'll scold her myself, so just pay 3,000 won more. I'll have to teach you a lesson later. All right, just give me 11,000 won. Do you have condoms? Not in a guest house, so just go and sleep. Get me some tissue. I will leave this fucked up guest house soon. I met the girl we're going to adopt. Her name is Soon Young. She's really nice. And she gave me this slingshot. Actually, I have it in my hands right now. And believe it or not, when I was on the beach shore just walking, and I was looking for shells, some boys started touching my hair, and she saved me. It was so scary. But it was actually kind of exciting at the same time, when we finally got away from them, you know what I mean? So, how are things over there? This sounds very exciting. When are you leaving? How long are you going for? Why did the American man come here? You know the reason, right? I don't really know. - But I heard he's taking me to America. - Why you? What about me and our dumb dad? Don't worry, I won't go. You aren't going? - I have to take care of you and Dad. - Fine, I'll go. You want to go to America? Of course I do. Who doesn't want to? - Why live in America when your family is here? - Family? I hate our family. But family is still the best, even if it sucks. Maybe you like this family, but I don't. Let me go to America. Say something. I told you to let me go to America. I don't make the decisions. I have to tell our uncle first. Tell him, right now! Tell him that I want to live in America. Why aren't you in bed? I need to talk to you. About going to America? You're leaving next week, so get ready. I won't go. Don't be stubborn. Your dad already agreed. Who'll take care of our family? I will. Why do I have to go to America? It's for your family. We don't have enough money to feed such a big family. So, be good and go to America. Go there and... I came here to say that I'm not going. Stop talking nonsense. If someone has to go, send Soon Ja. Soon Ja wants to go to America. I want her to live happily there with nice food and pretty clothes. Soon Ja can't go. She's ill. Dad. Will you really send me to America? No, right? You're so smart. What if I get shot there? Gun! Sweetheart, wake up. Breakfast is ready. Come on, rise and shine. Come on, it's time to get up. Uncle, please have breakfast. Screw this. Hey. Why are you suddenly acting like this? Don't you have a hangover? Stop bullshiting. I didn't prepare much, but eat your fill. No matter how hard you try, you can't go. Why can Soon Young go, but I can't? Because you're sick. I'm fine now. No, you know that you get sick all the time. My body isn't rotten like yours. Don't even think about going to America with that body. I'm doing all this for you. Stop whining and stay here. I'm going. Go and tell that American dad that I'm going. Got it? American dad? Are you out of your mind? Go and tell the American dad! - You crazy bitch! - Go and tell him! Are you fucking deaf? Bitch, I said that you can't go! But... Thanks for preparing breakfast for me. But the fact that you can't go doesn't change. What the hell are you looking at? Look at those sunken eyeballs. Hey! Soon Ja, we're late! Hurry up! I don't care. Soon Ja, why are you late again? Does everyone remember the multiplication table? - Yes, teacher. - Let's practice it again. Three times one is three. Three times two is six. Dad, I want to play in the water with my doll. No way, their queen sea is filthy. Barbie, do you wanna play with me? Oh, do you wanna swim in the sewer? Do you wanna get cholera? Dad. Please! Jesus. I'm going to the John, follow me. You want me to stand in front of a dirty smelly men's- Okay, then stay put. Bye. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! How pretty! You made this? You did a good job. How much? You got change? It's 1,000 won for one, but you can have it for 100 won. This is 100 dollars? It's pretty expensive. Can you even sell these high price merchandise? Hi! Barbie, we gotta go. Dad, come on. I'm having fun with Soon Young. I wanna stay longer. No way. Dad, I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna hang out here, okay? You don't know how dangerous Korea is. Just ten minutes. No, I'm waiting for an important call from the states. I left the phone in the room. We gotta go. See you soon, Soon Young. I have to go back to the hotel with my dad. Dad, come and eat noodles! Dad! Soon Ja, come and have noo- Why do you have so much money? The girl with yellow hair gave it to me. Why did she give that to you? I sold my key ring to her. Do you know this money is worth 100,000 won? How could you sell a 1,000-won key ring for 100,000 won? Are you a scammer? What? This is worth 100,000 won? I didn't know it's worth that much. We have to return this money to her. I'll give it back to her. Do you want to go to jail for fraud? Jail? Where did you meet the yellow-haired girl? Uncle, you're here? Have some noodles. Am I a fucking dog you feed your leftovers to? Hey. Go and wash your face and hair. Why do you always look so shabby? But I already showered. And you still look like this? How can a young girl smell like trash? We have to go somewhere, so finish eating and get ready. Hurry up. Take this sausage and stuff yourself. Lee Soon Young, Lee Soon Ja. Damn it. Are you worrying about your daughters? Soon Young is going to America next week. Be nice to her until she leaves. No, no. Me, Lee Soon Young, and Lee Soon Ja will live together forever. Stop fucking around. Why? Do you want to treat your daughters like slaves forever? How can a father have such thoughts? Lee Soon Young loves me. Love? Holy shit. Do you think that's love? It's just the fucking chains of fate. Anyway, Soon Young is going to have a better life in America. You just need to shut your mouth and eat this sausage. How dare you! Eat it. Let's see. Damn it. Didn't I tell you to wash your face? But there was so much laundry to do. Stop washing the clothes and wash your fucking face first. Uncle, swearing is bad. Well, why do you keep making me swear? Do you enjoy getting scolded? Why do I have to wash my face now? You can only take a photo for a passport with a clean face. A passport? You need a passport to go to America. It's not like you can take a bus there. I already told you that I'm not going. Fuck this! Do you think I'm joking? Come here. Stay still! Fuck off, you idiot! Dad, are you okay? Are you hurt? - Let me see. - Come here. Dad! Follow me. Just come with me! Stop it! Fuck you! Stop getting on my nerves! Don't hit my dad! What a fucking moving story of a father and his daughter. Dad! Hey, you! Knock it off! Knock it off! Put the camera down! Now! Stop! I'm not letting strangers take pictures of my daughter. Dad, it's okay. Dad, come on. You know I'm way too pretty not to have pictures taken of myself. It's so damn expensive. Small. What do you think of this one? Sue will love that! Oh, there's a similar one here. Great, then we can match. - How's the fit? - So cheap. Move it! Smile. Try to smile. That bitch. Just do it! One, two... Good job, you can go now. Soon Ja, you're so pretty! Lee Soon Ja is so pretty! What the fuck are you doing? I need to go somewhere, so keep an eye on the guest house. Dad, why are you adopting Soon Young if you already have two daughters? Well... Adoption is a very serious thing when it comes to children who already have family. Soon Young has a good father. But Soon Young's father is retarded. He's not really qualified to be a good father. Retarded people shouldn't have children. They're just spreading the misery around. Retarded people can raise children with just as much love as normal people. You're young and the world looks a little bit better to you than it does to adults, but you have to face reality. I'm adopting Soon Young so she'll have a chance at a better life. Hey, Barbie. I'll make more money to meet you in America. (Mum) Hey. Go and buy some drinks. All the stores are closed right now. I'll give you 3,000 won. Let's have a happy time. What are you doing? Please just sleep if you're drunk. Is 3,000 too little? I'll give you more money in the room. Come and have fun with me. Please don't do this! Please stop! - Stop! - I'll give you 2,000 won more. I'll give you 3,000 won more. Let's draw your favorite thing in today's class. Okay, teacher. Can you please buy this? Can you please buy this? Thank you! Thank you! What a coincidence, hi! Hi! Hi? I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't know you gave me so much money. I'm sorry. My sister returned the money, right? I will go have lunch with my father. Lunch together, okay? I have to go home. I have to cook for my sister and my dad. Dad, I wanna have lunch with Soon Young. No! Why not? I said so. - She's gonna live with us soon, why not? - No! Eat. I'm gonna send you home if you keep this up. I shouldn't have brought you here. Why can't she eat with us? Because I said so. That's not fair. Look, just stay away from her, period. You're gonna adopt her, right? She'll be with us for the rest of her life. She'll become our family. Why not? Case closed, eat. Sit. Soon Ja. Go and buy some drinks. Buy it yourself. Don't you know it's illegal for a child to buy alcohol? Everything you do is illegal anyway. You even drive without a license. Stop talking bullshit. Why do always talk back? I'll go. You just stay here and roast the meat. Soon Ja will go. This is all the meat we have left. Why is there only this much left? I only ate three pieces. It's like getting three of a kind in poker. At least you got a triple. Damn it. Relax and have some drinks. I'll go and buy more meat. Hey. Where are the two kilograms of meat that I bought last week? Oh, that... I'm sure your dad ate it all. Uncle, eat a little more. You can stuff yourselves. Meat. I want more meat. I'll make money and buy meat for you tomorrow. You know, this is really getting on my nerves. I'm gonna get some fresh air. You can either eat this or just go to bed, okay? I'll be back in a little while. Go away! Get lost! Hi. - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! How come you're still selling at this late hour? Hi! How about dinner together? I'm hungry. I could eat a bear. I'm so full. What about you? Why don't you eat more? I wish I could take the leftovers home for Soon Ja. - This? - Yeah. Mom? Is that your mom? My mom. My mom passed away last year in a car accident. My mom died when I was young. She went to Seoul to learn Korean. That's why I want to go to Seoul. Have you ever been to Seoul? Seoul? I don't like Seoul. I lived in Seoul for ten years after I was born, but it's where my mom died. It's so pretty! My father bought it for my sister, Sue. If you like it, you can keep it. I wish Soon Ja could wear this. Stop it! I'm a Barbie girl! In a Barbie world! Life is plastic! It's so fantastic! - Hello, hello! - Hello! - How are you today? - How are you today? - Good! - Good! Good! Dad, me and Soon Young are going to sleep together. That's out of the question. I insist. Don't push me. Don't get me mad. But, Dad! Over my dead body, young lady. Please! Knock it off. - Pretty please! - Knock it off. Thank you for the ride. Why are you with the American man and not working? Look, Soon Ja. It's your favorite, beef. Am I a dog you feed your leftovers to? Didn't you say you aren't going to America? Why are you hanging around with that American man? - I wasn't with him. - Don't lie. I'm not lying. Don't think that you can go to America. I'm not living here with a stupid dad for the rest of my life. I already told you that I won't go. But why were you with that American man until this late? Soon Ja, I'm sorry. I'll also take my sister's photo. Your sister's photo? Thank you. Hi, how are you? Hi. I'm Soon Young's sister, you know? Oh, what are you doing here? I wanna have fun with you and Barbie. What? You gave Soon Young's photo to that bitch? Are you out of your mind? Why did you give it to her? - Their photos were developed at the same time. - Damn it. Come again tomorrow. I should've just taken it at a photo booth. Why didn't you do so? Can't you do a quick print? My studio can't do that. Oh my fucking god. When can I leave this fucking place? Damn it! Just wait one more day. Where's Soon Ja? She left home early in the morning. That bitch. Did she do something wrong? She took your passport photo. Why can't you send Soon Ja instead? She really wants to go. I already told you she can't. Who would want to use a sick girl? What do you mean by use? I mean, the healthier the better. It's not right to export a product with a flaw. Do you like flawed products? Oh, no. Hello? Yeah. Okay. Tomorrow passport. Two or three day night finish, okay? - So do it already. - Yeah. Hey, I need money. Give me money. I'll give you money when you get the passport. I see. Hey, I don't have money. No bus money. Not my problem. Passport, money. Damn it. Hey, my mouth is very... talk, talk. I will tell Soon Young your fucking secret. Okay, I'll give you. some money right now. Some. Shove it up your ass. - Thank you. - Fuck you! I had fun, very fun. Bye, goodbye. See you later. Don't make that face. Think of it nicely. She's been with you all day. She looks so fake. That's why I hate her. Fake? She hides her inner feelings. Oh, all Asian girls are like that. No, Soon Young is a real gem. Put that away. But you have a fever. I'm just a little tired today. Turn off the lights. Uncle said you took my photos. Why did you take that photo is you aren't going to America? You're the worst. Uncle forced me to take it. Cut it off. I had a nice time with Mr. Steve today. I think he really likes me. So, don't even think about going to America. Okay, I really won't go. But you have to lower your body temperature first. I'm not sick! Good night, honey. What? Oh, I forgot it's not night there. Okay, well. Bye-bye, princess. Dad, what did you do to the sticker picture on my phone? You're too old for that kind of thing, honey. Dad, I don't get it! Why shouldn't I get along with my adopted sister? Why? You wouldn't understand. I'm not as immature as you think! Turn to page 37. Okay, teacher. Is everyone on page 37? Yes. Why is Soon Ja absent again? She's sick. Make sure she comes tomorrow. Okay. We will study the Tales of Zara today. - Look at the picture on page 115. - Yes. What is the background of the picture? A palace inside the sea! That's right. What characters do you see? A soldier, dolphin, turtle... Soon Young! What are you doing? How many times must I tell you not to do this in class? I'll call your mother to school if you do this again. Soon Young doesn't have a mom. That's the yellow-haired girl! A foreigner! Barbie! Barbie? Hi, Dad. I'm at Soon Young's school. Damn it. How about Soon Ja? Soon Ja? Why? Because Barbie and Soon Young really like each other now. And I'm afraid of what would happen if Barbie found out. Why Soon Ja? She is sick. Her body is not fresh, okay? We could have her checked out. And in the mean time, you could start working on getting Soon Ja a passport. 'Cause these things take a long time. Soon Ja? What the hell?! This crazy bitch. Seems like a big adios to her. Hi! Hi, how are you? Hi there. Is that for me? Thank you. Let me see something here. You know, there's a place I'd like to show you. Do you wanna go with me? Let's go! I'll go and get changed! Do you want this? You want to go to America, don't you? America? Yeah, don't you want to go to America? America? Are you really going to take me to America? Yeah, but before you go to America, you have to let the doctor look at you. I'm not sick... I'm not sick. Very, very healthy. Strong body. Dad, thank you for letting me have lunch with Soon Young. Barbie, we're taking Soon Ja with us and not Soon Young. Dad! Soon Young wears the pants in her family, and she has to take care of her retarded father. But, Dad, I like Soon Young better than Soon Ja. We're here to choose one of our family members. You should consider my opinion. That is why I came to Korea. But we have to consider their situation too. And anyway, Soon Young doesn't wanna come with us. Soon Young, don't you want to come to America with me? Could you translate for me? Yeah. Soon Young, come to America with me. She said to go to America with her. Tell her that you won't. Uncle, I can't go. Actually, I won't go. I don't want to go. I'll live in Korea with my dad and my sister. Oh, sorry, sorry. Soon Young hate going to America. I want America. I love America. I love America very, very much. See, Soon Ja wants to go home with us. Dad, I like Soon Young. I don't like Soon Ja's spooky eyes. Barbie, she might understand what you're saying. I sure hope so. Tell her what I say. Word for word. I hate Soon Ja. Soon Ja, Barbie said... Don't translate it. I heard that she hates me. I also hate you. You're so full of yourself. - Soon Ja! - I don't care if she hates me. All that matters is what Mr. Steve thinks of me. Tell Dad Steve that I want to be closer to him. You cunning girl. Tell him that I love Barbie so much. Dad, no matter what, you should take Soon Young. You can always come back and visit her. I hate Soon Ja! Her spooky voice gives me goosebumps. How did you make Barbie hate me? I didn't say anything about you to Barbie. Yeah, right. I bet you cursed me while you were with her. No matter how hard you try, I'm the one going to America. Soon Ja. I don't want you to go to America. Are you telling me to live here forever? Yeah, just hand in there, princess. Okay? I know it's hard, but you have to be patient for a little longer, okay? Yeah, Daddy will find a way. Take care, honey. Daddy loves you. Yeah. Bye-bye, princess. Instead of Soon Young, Soon Ja will go to America. Aren't you happy that Soon Young is staying? Huh? Don't you hate Soon Ja? We're lucky we got rid of one mean girl. Have some. Fuck you! Drink it. I told you to drink it. Aren't you also delighted? Aren't you happy? Fuck you! I'm doing all of this for you! Fuck you! Screw you! Soon Ja, don't fall sick. Fucking hell. (Jeil Clinic) Hi, honey. It's Daddy. How are you doing? Are you taking your medicine? Good girl! Listen, I got some good news for you. Guess what? D-Daddy's found your heart. Yeah, I told you I would. I keep my promises. Yeah, I wouldn't let anything happen to my little princess. I would protect her, that's what daddies do. As soon as we get home, honey, just do what the doctor says, and we'll be home soon, and everything will be okay. Don't resent me for sending you to America. You're the one who decided to leave. - So, don't... - I have to pee! Damn it. Thank you, Uncle. I'll never forget what you've done for me. I'll always remember your kindness in America. Soon Ja. Before you go to America... I want to give you a gift. Is there anything you want? Will you really buy me anything? Yeah, don't worry about the price. Choose the most expensive one. I want this one. Good choice. I want two of this. Why do you need two? Damn it. You are smart! - Hey. - Thank you! Soon Ja is very, very poor girl. She try and try only for good life. Understand? Don't fuck with me now. It's a little late for that. Hey, I don't know about medical. You steal heart. She die? We had a deal. Fucking bitch. She ended up walking into her own grave. Dad, don't think I don't know what's going on. What? Soon Ja. You're taking her for Sue, right? - Am I right? - Barbie! This is murder! This is our chance to save Sue. This isn't right. This is a murder. Are you going to let your sister die? Dad! You're buying a lot today. The chili looks good too. I'll give you some. Thank you. I gave you a lot. (Tasty food) That was hot. Can we take a photo? A photo? All right. Get ready. One, two... Sue, honey, what's wrong? Oh, this must be one of your bad days, huh? Well, just stay in bed, okay, honey? I know you have days like this. I wish I could be there for you. You just gotta hang on, you know? That's all we can do for now. Would you like to talk to your sister? She's right here. Sue, it's me! Are you okay? Your voice seems very weak. Well, my Korean friend made you a cellphone ring. It's really pretty. Are you crying? I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry! Really wish I could do something for you. Here's Dad. Promise me that you'll never take this off. Take this. - What is this? - I bought two identical phones. One for me, one for you. Is this really mine? Didn't you want one before? It looks so nice. I'll call you in America, so don't miss my call. I'll also call you sometimes. No, just wait for my call. International calls are expensive. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. It's not like I'm going to America to die. Soon Ja. Always listen to your American father. Always stay healthy. Got it. Take good care of Dad too. When I grow up and make a lot of money, I'll send you and Dad flight tickets to America. Got it? I'll definitely go there. I'll visit you with Dad. Stop crying, you fool. I told you to stop crying. She got sick this morning. Her doctor told her to stay in bed. I'm sorry I'm late. Soon Young. Why are you here? Oh, you're going home tomorrow. Soon Young. Yes, Barbie? I... I'm so sorry. Sorry? Don't be. I should be the one saying sorry. My only sister is sick. It's Soon Ja's first time on a place. She might be scared, so please hold her hand. My sister is sick. She hasn't smiled since she was young. Just wanna see her smile. My sister has been sick since young. Her manner might also be bad because she grew up without a mom, but she's actually a nice girl. I'm sure you'll grow to like her soon. I'll ask my father to take care of you and your father for the rest of your lives. I have a favor to ask you. Please look after Soon Ja like your real sister. Even if she's naughty and doesn't listen to you, please don't hit her or scold her harshly. I'll make it up to you when I meet you again in the future. I want America. I love America. Very, very much. Very, very much. I love America. Uncle, where are you? Let's eat together before Soon Ja leaves. Is he not coming? I think he's busy. Don't be too disappointed. No way, I'm not. He's already done so much for my trip. I'm really grateful to him. It's the first time he's been so nice to me. Am I leaving to die or something? Why do you two keep crying? These are tears of happiness. I'm so happy that you're going to a wonderful country. America is a country full of dreams. Dad, please start eating. Soon Ja, eat your fill too. Okay, I will. This is the last meal you'll ever cook for me. Why is this the last meal? Are you telling me to eat in this house again? Dad, have a lot yourself. I'll get to eat endless ham and sausages in America. No! Let me see the car. This way. This is awesome. (Crazy bitch) Goodbye, you bullheaded lass. Don't hate me when you're in America. You're the one who chose to go. I tried my best to stop you from going. All right. Thanks for listening. Stop pulling my heartstrings. I'm hanging up. Soon Ja is going to die! What are you talking about? Dad, don't cry. She's not going to die. Soon Ja will die if she goes! Do you want me to die? Don't worry, Soon Ja. Dad is just worried about sending you so faraway. I'll visit you in America when I make tons of money. How can you make tons of money selling key rings? I'll send you the money, so don't worry. Let's go to America. Come on. My dear Soon Ja! Wow, it's an American car! Barbie, take care of my sister. My sister is sick. Please take care of my sister, Soon Ja. I will thank you forever. Let's go.
