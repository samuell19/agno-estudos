Oh, come on, don’t bullshit a bullshitter No bullshit, like I said I went out last night after you guys had left to get some milk and I needed to clear my head I thought you was needed down at the Factory Something to do with the security firm It was just a false alarm I wasn’t needed after all Yeah, well if that was false alarm I know this Monica ain't one Alright, say what you're thinking Alright, is she a pro or what? I mean she looks the part and I wouldn’t blame you if you… I thought Tim, no, she's not, alright? Just because I've got a beautiful girl in my house and I might be 'Johnny no one' to most of the women I look at Please don’t think that's she's on the meter Alright, I’m sorry.

How does what feel? You and Jack, you’re a good match are you not? He’s too good for me You deserve it Monica, love No, I don’t Don’t you want what those two have? Maybe, but those two have an unconditional love You know the closest thing resembling love in your life is what Jack has already begun to show you It’s not fair. It isn’t the real deal You're wise Monica, I can’t force you into your decision I can only try and corrupt your way of thinking Ha… corrupt… you’re a life time of rock and roll too late to corrupt me It’s got a bit cold in here guys somebody open a window?

Don’t you want me? - I wouldn't charge you - Monica I’ve wanted you since the first second I saw you It’s because I told you my profession and you're just thinking about all the men that have been inside me That doesn’t change the way I feel at all Just us tonight Jack And what about tomorrow night? We'll see I just don’t want to disappoint you Why would you say that? Its, been a long time since I was with anyone - Jack, it's ok - No, I mean very long time Fuck off, you’re kidding What happened, you’re good looking enough Just always seemed to miss the boat, there was always someone more interesting than me I’ve been close loads of times it just never happened Do you remember what you said earlier? I said lots of things You said the ‘L’ word I did, didn’t I? Yeah I should have said ‘liked’ Yeah, but if you said that you would have meant love anyway Yeah Come here Relax okay?

You know, I mean like go out, go to the shops or for something to eat, you know just do something fun I don’t think so, Jack Okay Maybe we can hang out here more Maybe What’s the matter, babe? I am not your babe Oh Sorry I'm sorry What for? For invading your life like I have over the last forty-eight hours or so It's fine. It's better than talking to the walls like I usually do I know, it’s been nice Would you maybe like some breakfast? Yeah, that would be good Great, now either I can cook it or we can go down to the café at the end of the road and have a 'fat boy breakfast' A what? You know, a 'fat boy breakfast' like a full English fry up Let’s do that Great, I'm just gonna jump in the shower and then we can go Okay Maybe you would like to join me?

You look dry Not yet, you ready to go already? I thought I heard you talking to someone? I’m sorry. I can’t hurt you anymore Where are you going? I’m going away from this corrupt evil place If that is so, why are you running through the night from the only decent person who makes your life worth living? It wasn’t real, it was not unconditional love, it was flawed You’ve hurt so many Monica And now you’ve hurt the one man who just didn’t see you as a piece of meat Shut up! Shut up, now! [phone rings] Hello? Who is this? You were ringing me, I answered it Don’t play games with me, why are you ringing me at this time of night? But... you rang me Mila, is that you? Yes Mum Who is this? It’s me, mum, Monica Hello? Excuse me Don’t you remember your daughter, Monica? My Monica went away years ago No, she didn’t. I’m still here I am not your mother, now please, goodnight I need help I can’t help you anymore whoever you say you are Believe me My full name is Monica Mila Scott I don’t believe in my daughter anymore I believe in my mother You know it’s me, don’t you? I can hear it in your voice You hear tiredness, now please What can I say to prove myself to you? What can I do? I know who you are and I knew this call would come eventually When the bitch ego had burnt away You are not part of me anymore you never came from me You had closure on the good life I brought you into when you walked out on us with that useless feller of yours Okay Silence is the only way to prove to this family that you’re still alive I just want to say I’m sorry that... I didn’t live up to your expectations of what a daughter should be Well it’s a good job you had a sister It is, how is Sarah? She’s living a comfortable life and takes good care of me when she can Good night, you sleep well [dial tone] Monica Hello, hello mum Monica Not you again, you fucking bastard Like I said, Monica, you shouldn’t be running from Jack No one will help you like he will not even your mum will help you now You were pretending to be her you played me like a fool again You’re playing yourself a fool, Monica and as for pretending to be your mum You hit redial and see what else she has to say to you in the middle of the night They were the real words from a real mum who despises you What did I do to deserve this fucking torment? You were born weak, Monica weak, sad and hopeless Fuck you, you bastard Go back to Jack, you'll be strong with him Maybe But I wouldn’t be happy You’d be happier than you are now And happier than going back to that useless guy Jack saved you from Think about it Monica So, where have you been? I’ve been in love You cost us a lot fucking money while you’ve been away Oh, shut it you moaning bitch, I’m back now And I’m open for fucking business [doorbell] Jack Oh shit Do you got to do that to get people’s attention? I don’t it to get attention. I do it to remind myself that I’m still alive What, by trying to cut your fucking arm off? I thought you grew out all this self-harm shit? The frequency of harming has… the doctors helped me with that Sometimes it still gets on top of me I just get so bogged down I need some realise from my day to day shit You can contact us Jack if there’s a problem, the door is always open, mate It is If I came to you every time I felt down I’d have moved in by now We are your best remedy Jack, not cutting It’s so dangerous, what happens if go through an artery by mistake I only even cut into the fat… I don't go for the wrists… I'm not trying to kill myself You thought about the gym to work out this built up energy? I’m already there three times a week Maybe five, from today [sighs] I’m so lucky to have you as friends But you know what, you’re so lucky to have each other I just can’t stand much more of this aloneness it’s driving me up the fucking wall Every morning I wake up with only my shadow for company I’ve tried so hard to find someone to call my own, and to find someone to call me the same Maybe you’re looking too hard? She’s out there Jack I promise you she is I sincerely hope so Mate, you know so and you know what? When you do find her, she’s going to be ten times better than that bitch Monica who walked out on you I guess she had her reasons Are you okay Jack? Do you want to be sick? - I’ll go get a bowl - No, no You know guys, most nights I go to sleep with the lights on Just because I can’t fucking stand the idea of them being off all night I lie there and the night drags on and I pray for just an hour’s sleep If there’s a problem why don't you just come to us? But I need to help myself first How about some takeaway food then? Come on Chinese man, your favourite - I’m not hungry - Ah, bullshit You’re never not too hungry for Chinese Look Jack I know what you’re going through alright? But trust me man she's not worth it She really isn’t - It’s just - Look It’s her bullshit I don’t want to hear any more excuses for her, okay? She left, it's not your fault Sure yeah guys, see you in the week Jack I’m worried about Jack, babe Yeah, me too He’ll be all right. He's been through worse shit than this, hasn't he? He’s just too sensitive for his own good sometimes Sometimes, you mean all the time I guess, shall we get a taxi? Hmm... let’s walk, it’s a nice night Hello? Monica Oh, you guys Yeah, what happened between you and Jack? He's lost without you He was lost already before I came along Hey, that’s our friend you’re talking about What happened? Was he just not good enough for you? He was good to me, perfect even In what way? Do you not realise how upset he is? We were together for a couple of days Anyone would have thought he hadn’t been loved up for years Maybe, but not anyone who’s anyone For Jack, I don't think you don’t understand how much it meant for him to have a partner You say he hasn’t been loved up for ages try forever. Put it this way, you were his first You don’t think I didn’t notice? You don't think he wouldn't tell me that little fact before I allowed him to dip the biscuit If Jack can’t grow up and be an adult then he shouldn’t be playing an adult’s game Is this all this is to you, a fucking game? Upsetting people left, right and centre? Listen honey, I’m with different people all of the time, because I have to It's just what I'm worth We've all heard your blessed virgin story and yeah, I do feel sorry for Jack But when it comes down to it, I don’t deserve love, not from Jack, not from anyone Yeah? After meeting you I'm pretty sure that's how Jack feels right now Bollocks When me and Jack first met, I bet it was his dream to rescue the damsel in distress If it had been any other guy a thank you fuck would have been good enough, but No, I had to wonder into Jack's world the lad with all the love and no one to receive it He didn’t tell you my profession, did he? He’s been feeding you little white lies since I’ve been gone? Well, let's just say, I didn’t charge him to lose his virginity Even I wouldn’t sink that low I really want to smack you in the head Go on then, that's usually the reaction I get when guys have had enough of me Monica, Jack would never have told us about your situation, he’d respect you more He’s probably more respectful than you are I like your hair Vicky What do you use to keep it looking so good? I... I... Wait don’t tell me, I don’t give a fuck Let me ask you another question Do you smell piss around here? Piss, urine, you know? Well, yeah, we know and no, we don’t That’s cause you’re not walking in my shoes. Maybe if I come a little closer? I was with a guy earlier; you know what I have to do to make sure he gets his jollies off? He pisses on me and then he pays me double to return the favour It takes me four washes to really get rid of the smell And that guy, that piece of shit comes around to see me at least twice a week The fucking bastard Look just because I accept Jack and his problems doesn’t mean I want to be with him and I know Jack accepted me but he sure as fuck isn’t having me One second babe What now? What was that all about? Just girl talk What? You look amazing as usual, Monica I look like a whore, but thanks, I guess I’m sorry for this life we are in Makes two of us, doesn’t it? Things will get better for us, I promise You do, do you? So, when are you going to start selling your arse to pay rent? And the loan sharks and every other crooked fuck you owe money to? Hey, parts of those debts belong to you as well You were on the junk remember? That shit don’t come cheap Did he pay already? Yes, three hundred, he’s paid full works Shit I fancied a quickie as well Let him in, let’s get this miserable fuck over and done with Say Yeah? Do you want me afterwards? I could never say no to you, Mon And will you love me afterwards? I will always love you I always have and I always will No time for romance Send him in Barry - Yes - If you’re going to the store will you pick me up my prescription? Okay Sure She’s all yours sunshine You have two hours with her treat her right, alright? Okay, sure perfect One other thing I know every inch of her body and if there’s any bruises there that weren’t there when I get back, God help you Okay Where is it? What? My medicine I asked you to get my prescription last night, but it's not here Shit, babe I forgot Fucking always, you didn’t forget to get pissed up at the pub last night, did you? You can go and get it, you haven’t a client for another two hours or so Fucking hell Barry I don't think I can live like this all I ask was for you to get me medicine in I forgot ok, I was going to, I met with some folk at the pub, they offered me some work We got chatting is all, I couldn’t leave not while they offered me what they did Good work? Good enough, yeah I told you last night about my situation why can’t you just leave me to live my life I did listen to what you said and you can tell me and Tim were both shocked We didn’t realise the hardships in your life Well that was the truth of the matter can’t you just respect that? I do I was afraid of Jack if you really must know In what way? He isn’t the violent type Not that type of fear I was afraid of what he gave me, love I was afraid of letting myself go to someone who truly loved me for who I am I assume you find it hard to put trust in people Sometimes yeah half the people I meet I only trust them before they pay for services rendered It shouldn’t be like that for you, Monica You got a lot more going for yourself and Jack can see it Jack and I seemed to understand each other He knew what I was or at least my Job before we did anything he knew the risks of sleeping with me and I knew the risks of letting someone as unstable as Jack fall for me Unstable? You know, all this pity and self-harm shit he does It's not pity Monica and it sure isn’t shit he does to himself if that’s the real reason you’re afraid of Jack then you have really misunderstood him I guess I didn’t stay around long enough to understand him Listen, this self-harm he does I admit really puts the wind up me and Tim And we've told him time and time again that doing that isn’t the answer to his problems But I tell you, Monica These episodes he has are not an attack on anyone but himself What do you think? Would you like to go back to him? He seems like a good guy but I worry about the harming If Jack can’t control himself in that sense then I guess he has to deal with the consequences of his actions Maybe me and Jack We can learn to live without are old habits I can learn to love and he can learn to be more comfortable in himself If you do go back, go back because you want to not because you feel under duress Sure What is it? You know, he's a strange lad, is our Jack He does have his moments, true I want to be the reason you love I got scared I just wanted you to know from the get go, who I was, what I do and I didn’t want to run the risk of hurting you I forgive you - Do you think? - Yes? Do you think we can get out of the city for a while, go elsewhere? Get to know each other in a different environment Where shall we go? I don't know, let’s just keep driving and see where we end up Destination unknown I like that What is it? Just I never thought I could bring so much happiness to one person and in return he could do the same to me Well you do believe it No one’s ever taken the time to understand me, not even me I gave up on that years ago I’m glad I’m the first Me too Where are we? - Somewhere, nature’s calling give me a second - Sure Excuse me Oh, thank you Monica, who is this? Where did he come from? He was walking Don’t look so worried sport I didn’t do anything yet to her I think we should go Can you people give me a lift, please? Anywhere away from here please, please take me home We don’t really know where we are heading ourselves, mate Okay, please can you take me to the next town I'm desperate to get away from this place I think we should... Please don’t fob me off, you're good people I can see it in your auras You can help me I know you can We can’t just leave him out here I guess Okay, we will give you a lift Oh thank you my friend, thank you What’s wrong? I think I need to do what you did Ah okay We don’t go yet? - Soon - Oh okay, okay I think I've got some food if you want, man In time, thank you Tress is the name by the way Nice name, very unique well, I'm Jack and my girlfriend's Monica Jack, how original Yeah, I guess So what’s the deal with you two, huh? You got everything you want and more at home but you’re still running away from it What’s that supposed to mean? Well, you folks I see you all the time on the roads Always running from some shit that’s going on So what’s the deal here, we’ve known you for five minutes, offered you a drink and some food And now I have to justify myself to you Yeah, something like that Thank God Here she comes Whore of the day Excuse me You heard me, she’s too good for you look at her, knickers up her arse, fucking cheap Shut it or I’ll fucking have you What is it? Get in the car What, you’re just going to leave me out here? What’s happening? Alright, alright, he can’t take a fucking joke That wasn’t a joke what you said Get in For fuck's sake, not today, what are you playing at? Why are you doing this? If I killed her, what would you do? If you killed her, you’d only have a dead body to protect you from me I’d grab them scissors and ram it down your fucking throat Only a dead body? Not the body of the lady you love? You know what I mean I will do it, yes I will Why do you two deserve this happiness? While so many others are in pain all day, every day It’s so unfair on us, why? What makes you so special? I can’t believe I’m fucking hearing this I can’t believe what? If you only knew how much pain and misery Monica and I have been through before we met Why I’m I explaining myself to you? Because I’m holding your lady tighter than you have I don’t know what your problem are but pulling a pair of scissors on us isn’t going to resolve anything This is not the answer to your problems Scissors seem to help you with your problems, don’t they Jack? Told you I can read auras and what about you Monica? Are my voices worse than the voices you hear? You don’t know anything about me… us, let us go He doesn’t love you He does Jack You want to see my proof of love for Monica, really do you? Come on then you fucking coward let’s see you read my fucking Aura now Excuse me mate are you the owner? No, he’s gone out Do you know if they are any rooms free? Yeah, I think one of the two at the top of the stairs is free Any rooms? Yeah, apparently I’ll let him know you’re here Cheers mate, thank you very much come on This looks alright, doesn’t it? How are you feeling? Like shit where did he come from? Don’t you worry about him he’s gone now How does a person get to that point in their life? I couldn’t give two fucks about him he threatened me God, you’re trembling you want to take some sleep? Later Jack, that was the second man you’ve saved me from I had you all wrong When I first left you I thought that you were this wallflower boyfriend too quiet for his own good To be honest I thought you wanted someone to look after you I was wrong to assume that of you Jack I guess now I know you don’t need anyone to look after you You’re stronger than just about anyone I know Well, I’m glad you didn’t judge this book by its cover You never know folk, hey? True I think we need some sleep It's been a long day Not yet I think I’ll go outside and have a cigarette Okay Shit! What are you doing out here the middle of the night Monica? Shouldn’t you be with Jack tucked up in a nice warm bed? There isn’t any out running you, is there? You should know that by now, that’s impossible until this pact is paid up? I’m so tired of this I just want to live my own life Go to him Monica Jack is waiting For fuck’s sake Damn thing May I? So How serious is it between you two? Just a fuck, right? Who would want me? Jack wants you The rewards for you both out of this will be good They will make up for all the pain you both have had, you’re a perfect couple Wow Wow, what? Wow you, you look amazing If we're going to go out, you're going to have to get used to the complements I'm sorry, I’m just really tired that bed is not as comfy as yours yeah, it's not the best, is it? So, what do you want to do today? Keep driving, or you like to stay? You need to keep moving Monica Don’t you think today's the day this pact needs paying up You okay? yeah, I just had that feeling you know when someone walks over your grave Not yet, I hope I think we should hit the road Perfect Now, are you ok? yeah This bed is a bit rough isn’t it? This must be the one the owner of the B and B meant What and not the other three castles down the road Ah, you cheeky beggar come on let’s have a look Sure, you'll be my tour guide Yeah, it will cost ya - Don’t even think about asking me to go up there - Ah, come on You can if you want but my feet are staying put Five minutes, yeah? I give you ten Yeah, good idea You're here aren’t you? Enough, this ends today Now is the time Monica time for our deal that needs paying And then, we can both stop running? Maybe, Monica, you got Jack here this far now you need to do the rest I hear you You should come up, the view is amazing I can’t I can’t hurt him anymore Now is the time Jack time for our deal that needs payback No, no, no, not you, not you again Monica, Monica, we need to go Don’t listen to a word he says Monica about leaving You’ve brought us to this place for a reason you wanted a place to be wed You have it, and you wanted a man to love you for who you are He is in front of you now May I? Are you alright? Monica, why didn’t you answer me? We need to go, there is something not quite right about this place I’m sorry, Jack For what? For bringing you into my life You can apologise later we need to go now I’m such a loser Jack and you aren’t You’re a good man and I brought you down to such a pathetic level I don’t believe that Today could be your special day? Special day? what do you mean? Monica, answer me? Today your prayers could be answered you get to marry the woman of your dreams I didn’t propose yet You thought about it, haven’t you? Truthfully yes, I did think about it but I wanted to give it time to see how you and I developed Thinking about it was good enough to get us to where we are What do you mean? We need to do this, Jack before he comes, we owe him We owe who? You hear him, just as much as I do For our love, Jack… our relationship… this is what we prayed for, remember? Think Jack, this is what you prayed for, us Accept it Jack, I’m real Who are you? Trust me Jack you wouldn’t want to witness me Monica, what is going on here? Just ask to marry me it will be over soon enough No, I want answers to my questions You deserve to know He talks to people all over the world not just us Please let it be over Anyone I pray, please, please Ok Jack No, I can’t believe it Believe it, the same happened to me also Monica, you okay? Yeah Are you ready to see your client now? Soon I need to get changed You’re a good girl Bet you wouldn’t sell your arse to pay the rent, would you? Barry the Bastard Please Can someone take me away from this paid lust Ok Monica I’m so sorry it happened to both of us Some people are lucky in love, some not so In our loneliness, babe we were at are most vulnerable Vulnerable to this, no, I can’t accept it We have to I know you struggle with your days and nights of loneliness The self-harm Waking up each morning feeling as shit as the night that before but I can change that this is Destination’s end for us both A made to measure love affair? Yes I know you're happy with me, Jack I see it and I know you do too Why us? What makes us so special? Don’t flatter yourself too much Jack There are many more miserable souls like you both I’m working right now So concentrate on them and leave us alone - If you only need… - This isn’t just about finding the perfect souls Jack This is about a quota I need many weak souls like you You give us love and we give you our souls to use as you see fit, something like that? Something like that, yes Monica When you prayed was it me that you wanted or needed? Yes, to some extent I needed love Love and affection that only a man of pure heart could offer I meet many types of lust in my day to day but none could offer what you would Jack But you walked away from me I was scared I didn’t want to infect you with my issues I’m listening The other half of this deal was that… I guess you could call it my infection would be repressed I have what the doctors call passive Schizophrenia I’m sorry It's not your fault It's just something I have to live with When you said infect me with your issues, what did you mean? Since you’ve been with me has the desire to self-harm dropped a little? I guess Me too, like you admit you suffer with the self-harm, I suffer with the voices I hear so many Jack, not just the one you and I share today If we go through with this the self-harm will be quenched and the voices will be wiped I'll probably still be left with one but I'll have a little peace in my life That’s it Monica, tell him the truth I need your souls for my quota I can’t take your souls until you marry Then I have truly given you something that requires a payback He hasn't proposed yet Monica those prayers of yours and mine weren't for his listening This isn’t the real deal A love story cannot be created through a pact with… I’m not the main man Jack I’m his messenger People often refer to me as Mephistopheles Think of me as his talent scout looking for the damned Jesus An auditory possession is that what this is? More than you know Jack more than you know I brought you happiness at a price that still has to be paid I know you both want your happy ending in life Without each other you're both on the verge of death Can you afford to not be without each other? Jack, I have seen one future for you The way your life is playing out You’re going to get in such a state that there will be a cut that no plaster will heal And you Monica I have prolonged those other voices that have been talking you to death What do you think? Jack, for once in your life be a man and take charge ask this woman to be your wife All this will be over and then your souls will be a peace with each other Jack, you’ve already me enough love to last me a life time, but this isn’t the final act What happens when we get to the end of this pact, then what? Monica, do you believe me or him? You of course You believe I can help you? if you want help Yes, thank you You’ve saved me from two guys the least you can do is save me from myself It’s the least I can do, well, I’ll try to Do you really think you can both outgrow your personal demons, without my help? I can stop self-harming and learn to be stronger in life And you Monica? Could you outgrow those voices? And not just mine? I can try You ungrateful fools! You owe me Today we owe you nothing and we never will Walk away from me, you walk away from each other, you’ll be alone without my help We are both used to being alone my friend You’ve chosen the wrong souls to scare with that idol threat Don’t tempt me Jack you’re both making a very big mistake You know He told me you would save me When? He did and that I’d also save you in return When did he say that? The night we first met Before you showed me the wounds on your arm, remember? I remember To be honest with you Yeah? You saved me well before that moment you gave me something to live for That’s very sweet Perfect
