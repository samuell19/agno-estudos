♪ ♪ Narrator: John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States. For millions of Americans, he is the greatest President ever. -Man: If there was such a thing as a rock star President, he was idolized by the people. -Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. -Man 2: He made politics an honorable profession. But behind the conviction and the charisma, JFK was a man of contradictions. -Jack Kennedy was a noble statesman, but he had a dark side. A wise and cautious leader who, behind the scenes, lived life on the edge. -He was as reckless a President in his personal life as America has ever had. A picture of health and vigor hiding a private struggle from the world. -The best-kept secret in modern politics was probably John Kennedy's health problems. Yet he was a man of great vision who inspires to this day. -Jesse Jackson: He is a major force in American history, as an iconic figure for justice and hope and change. These are the days that tested and defined him. There are seven critical days that shaped the man and created the legend. Moments of crisis, times when he had to stand up and decide his own future and the future of the nation. In his teens, on the brink of death, he must fight to survive. As a captain in World War II, he must choose whether to put his life on the line for his men. As a young Presidential contender, will he defeat a formidable political fighter on live TV in front of the nation? As President, how far will he dare to go in publicly revealing his appetite for glamour and women? With the world on the brink of nuclear war, JFK must choose whether to trust the military or his own judgment. He has to decide between politics and principle and must make up his mind whether to gamble his presidency to support the Civil Rights Movement. It was a life cut tragically short on one last fateful day in Dallas. [siren blaring] [gunshot] Age 16, John Kennedy is a pupil at an elite private school. Known by his friends and family as "Jack," he is rebellious, but well liked. -Jack Kennedy was always a troublemaker. But people found him inspiring because he was adventurous, and he was always looking for fun. -He's the boy who can charm the birds out of the trees. He's the charismatic boy, he's the boy with the great sense of humor. But Jack was also plagued by illness. One day he's in the school infirmary for what seems like a dose of flu. ♪ ♪ -Doctor, doctor! -He seemed to have some mysterious illness. His condition becomes so serious, he's rushed to a nearby hospital. Analysis of Jack's blood raises more questions than answers. -The doctors could not get to the bottom of what was causing this illness. All they can say is "We think it is a blood illness. It could be a blood infection of some sort." They think he may have leukemia, which of course is a blood cancer. Alarmed, the doctors fear Jack Kennedy is on the brink of death. They decide to contact Jack's parents. -Joe Kennedy's told by the doctors that this is serious. "In fact, your son may not survive." -JFK's father was told that his chances of living were perhaps 5 in 100. It's looking likely that Jack Kennedy is going to die. In a state of shock, the school holds a church service to pray for him. Despite Jack's condition, his mother and father make no effort to travel to his bedside. -His parents are not there. They're there in spirit so to speak, but physically, they're not there. They have all these other obligations. Born into one of America's wealthiest families, Jack's upbringing was very pressurized. His father, Joe Kennedy, was a ruthlessly ambitious businessman. -His father was a really dominating character, very powerful and very demanding of his children. Determined that all his children should succeed. Jack's mother Rose busy raising nine children, had little sympathy for illness. -Rose Kennedy says in her diary, "Why does anyone have an illness?" And just push it aside, and that's the way she dealt with the children. Suffering from many medical problems, Jack was used to struggling through his illnesses alone, but he'd never come so close to death. As the night of February 4th draws on, Jack is in a grave condition, but he's a fighter. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -There was this sort of will to survive right from the very beginning. -Hey, how you doing? To the surprise of his doctors, Jack Kennedy defies everyone's worst fears. -You look so much better. -Once he was stabilized, he did, thank goodness, recover with still no final diagnosis of what had caused this serious illness. To this day, no one knows what nearly killed 16-year-old Jack Kennedy. He would spend the next two months recovering. Jack refuses to feel sorry for himself, and his letters are full of humor. To a school friend he writes, "It seems that I was much sicker than I thought, and I'm supposed to be dead. So I am developing a limp and a hollow cough." Jack's resilience was crucial to surviving in a fiercely ambitious family who had little sympathy for any sign of weakness. -The Kennedy family was endlessly, ruthlessly competitive all the time. Touch football, swimming, sailing, parlor games, even academics. His mother's absence at one of the most important moments of his life helped shape Jack's attitude towards women. -It had a profound effect, a sort of inner resentment, that he'd never had that kind of maternal affection with his mother. For Jack, this brutal realization of his vulnerability was life changing. From now on, he would seize life with both hands. Jack was an amazing person who had faced death and faced it down. He had enormous physical courage. Over the next ten years, Jack toys with a career in journalism or politics. He travels through Europe on the brink of war and gains a reputation as a playboy. He graduates from Harvard, and on December 9, 1941, he wakes up to find his country at war with Japan. Jack tries to join the Navy, but he has back and bowel problems and is rejected by the military on health grounds. My uncle Jack wanted to be where the action was, where the fight was, and that putting your hat into the ring is what mattered. Jack's father pulls strings, and the young Kennedy eventually manages to get into the Navy. He volunteers to work on patrol torpedo boats in the South Pacific. JFK wants a slice of the action, but little does he know quite how dangerous it will be. 26-year-old Jack Kennedy is the captain of a patrol torpedo boat, PT-109, stationed in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. He's in charge of the lives of 12 men. -I don't think there's any way to contribute to that war more fitting for President Kennedy's personality than captaining a PT boat. They were fast, they were unbelievably dangerous. Kennedy's mission is to attack a Japanese convoy on its way to supply enemy troops occupying neighboring islands. -We knew from the coast-watcher that the Japanese would arrive about 11:00 PM that night into Blackett Strait, where we could best stop them. Jack Kennedy has no way of telling where the convoy is. He waits in the darkness, ready for the signal to attack. He turns two of his three engines off to avoid being heard. What's more, Kennedy's communication equipment isn't working properly. -This is PT-109. Do you read me? A few kilometers away, Jack's friend Ted Robinson is also on the mission and is on one of the few PT boats that have radar. -I picked up the pips on the radar screen coming in very fast and very large. I was sure they were the destroyers. -Convoy located, convoy located. -So we said "Here we go," and I thought, God, this may be it. Seconds later, Ted's boat comes under heavy fire from the Japanese convoy, and he's forced to retreat. -This is PT-109. Do you read me? At the other end of the channel, Jack Kennedy continues to wait for the Japanese convoy, still unaware of its position. -Enemy ship approaching fast! One of his crew is stunned to see a Japanese destroyer, 40 times bigger than PT-109, bearing down on them at full speed. For the second time in JFK's life, death looks inevitable. The 2,000-ton Japanese destroyer is closing in on Jack Kennedy and his crew. Rather than trying to flee, Kennedy makes a split-second decision and turns the wheel towards the enemy ship to fire his torpedoes from point blank range. But it's too late. The Japanese destroyer rams into him, smashing his boat to pieces. -That destroyer cut him right in half. We saw this huge explosion, and we thought nobody could have lived through that. -The two PT boats following put on all three of their engines and take off. Their captains believe that no one could have survived the explosion that they saw. Two of the crew on Kennedy's boat are killed instantly. The rest are thrown into the burning water. Kennedy survives but is badly injured. -President Kennedy was at the helm, and he was immediately jerked backwards, which severely damaged his back. JFK's first thought is, "This is how it feels to be killed." The injured Kennedy clings to the wreckage with the sea ablaze around him. -Man: Help! -Then he hears shouts in the darkness. -Jack, like a damned fool, dove into that flaming gasoline because his men were screaming and crying, and confused and dying. Jack Kennedy searches for his men for an hour. Helped by some of his crew, he tows the injured survivors back to the wreckage of the boat. -Jack got terrible gasoline burns, and he got his men back, and they all hung on to the boat. -You wonder whether he dove into the water because he felt he had to or dove in because it was his duty. But it had to be that it was a mix of all of those that drove him to this extraordinary act of bravery. By 1 PM on the second of August, Jack Kennedy and his crew had been in the water for ten hours, surrounded by the enemy. -The boat is drifting directly towards where the Japanese had 40,000 troops, so Jack knew he had to do something. The closest uninhabited island is five and a half kilometers away. One crewman is too badly injured to swim the distance. -He took the tie strings of the man's jacket in his teeth, and he had to paddle. The South Pacific is absolutely full of sharks, full of sharks. Now sharks attack when you're bleeding. This man was bleeding. With Jack Kennedy towing the injured man, the rest of the crew follow. After four hours of battling through shark-filled waters, they finally make it to the island. -When he first got to Plum Island, he was in terrible shape. Kennedy and his crew are exhausted, but if he doesn't get help fast, the injured crewman will die. Desperate, he comes up with a plan of action. -I think President Kennedy determined that he would do everything possible to ensure their survival. And so he took the last pistol that they had and a lantern, And he swam out into the straits. Jack's plan is to use the lantern to try to attract a passing U.S. Navy ship. He's exhausted and is battling against strong currents. Finally, he reaches a coral reef where he can stand. He uses his lantern to signal, but now he's at risk of being fired on by his own side. -Captain Dick Keresey, who had been out with President Kennedy the night of the sinking of PT-109, told me that if they had seen a lantern, they would have trained every gun on that position and fired until it was absolutely destroyed. And I said, "What would you have done then?" And he said, "We would have gone over to investigate, "and we would have found President Kennedy dead, "but we would have known that the crew was still alive, and we would have gone looking." Jack waits, but no U.S. ship shows up. So he returns to his men. Little does he know that he and his crew have been given up for dead and a funeral is held for them back at the naval base. -It was a little funeral, and we got on our knees, and I said the Lord's Prayer as best as I could remember it, and we all said goodbye to Jack and his crew, and we thought that was the end of that. Alive but 50 kilometers behind enemy lines, Kennedy knows that he and his ten men are simply part of the cost of war. Later he writes home, "Thousands of casualtys sound like drops in the bucket, "but if those thousands want to live as much as the ten that I saw, "the people deciding the whys and wherefores had better make mighty sure "that all this effort is headed for some definite goal and that when we reach that goal, we may say it was worth it." Jack and his crew have hardly any food or water, in an area constantly patrolled by the Japanese. -Ted Robinson: The only real food would be the coconut milk. So, they gradually were starving to death, is what was really happening. Jack Kennedy knows if they don't get help soon, they will die. He spots some local fishermen and lights on an ingenious method of communication. -He scratched this thing on a coconut with a knife, said something to the effect, "11 still alive, send help." Kennedy hands the coconut to one of the fishermen and asks them to deliver it to a U.S. Army lookout on a neighboring island. It's a big gamble. If the Japanese discover the message, Kennedy and his crew could be captured and tortured. ♪ ♪ The next day, his ingenuity pays off. The coconut is smuggled to the lookout and then, finally, to Ted Robinson. -I was the first to get the most famous coconut in the world that ended up on his President's desk the rest of his life. I was just delighted. It was old Jack, the guy I knew, and he was alive. Five days after the dramatic events of August 2, 1943, Ted Robinson heads off to rescue the survivors. -Here this guy is. When we picked him up, his feet were cut to shreds. He was starving, he was in pain. He said, "Where in the hell have you guys been? I've been at this bus stop for a whole week now." I will never ever forget that, never. Still kidding, and we thought, Oh, that's got to be Jack. Jack and his crew are in terrible shape and are sent to recover. -A month to the day of after I rescued him, I lost my boat, and they stuck me in the same tent with Jack. When JFK got his orders to go home, he ripped them up. He said, "No I wanna go back up the line." I said "Hell, give, give me those orders. I'll put my name on them. I want to go home." But no, he said I'm going back up the line. The events of August 2 make headlines across America. Jack Kennedy is thrust onto the national stage. He's hailed as a hero. -Jack Kennedy always made a joke of being a hero. He used to say, "I got a medal for losing my boat." He said, "I don't know how often that happened." -He did not regard himself as heroic and he certainly never talked about the truly remarkable courage that he showed. After his wartime experiences, the sickly child of the family throws himself into politics, where he has a meteoric rise. In 1946, a year after leaving the Navy, he becomes a Democratic congressman. In 1952, he's elected Senator for Massachusetts. The following year, he marries the beautiful socialite Jacqueline Bouvier. One year later, he undergoes an operation on his back, during which he almost dies. In 1960, at age 43, Jack Kennedy wins the Democratic nomination to become one of the youngest Presidential candidates in American history. -We stand today on the edge of a new frontier. The frontier of the 1960s, the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils. Jack Kennedy must now face his Presidential rival in the showdown of the century. -Unemployment through the 50s? Like 50s, five, seven. JFK and his advisers are preparing for the most important night in his bid for the U.S. Presidency. -How we doing? -Let's go. -All good? -Ted, quick fire, okay? -Population growth, past ten years. -18.5%. -Okay. Science and engineers? -Two, two times, twice as many. -Americans in poverty? -Ah, fifty million. In six hours time, JFK is appearing in the first-ever televised Presidential debate, up against his Republican rival Richard Nixon. -Food packages? -The first debate in Chicago was the crucial test for Jack Kennedy. If he was going to be successful, he had to succeed in that first debate. -Okay, population growth? -18.5%. As a politician, Jack Kennedy's yet to make his mark. He's young and Roman Catholic, which makes him an outsider and an unlikely candidate for President. He also faces a daunting opponent. Richard Nixon is the Vice President, a household name with a serious track record in government. -Jack Kennedy is good-looking, rich, but he's not yet a statesman. Richard Nixon, who's been Vice President, is in the public mind associated much more with gravitas and world affairs and dealing with big problems. -Jack Kennedy had never had any previous exposure to this sort of confrontation. So there were questions about how competent Jack would be, how confident he would be, how effective he would be in dealing one-on-one with Nixon. -Food packages? -Food packages, that's four million. -That's four million. It's youth versus experience, and Kennedy and his advisers are feeling the pressure. -18.5%, 18.5. -The stakes for Jack Kennedy are enormous on this night. He is this young, untested, inexperienced, callow man making his first appearance really before the American people. More than seventy million people are watching this debate. He can't blow it. Kennedy appears the picture of health, but it's a sham. He's suffering from a life-threatening condition called Addison's Disease and relies on a battery of steroids, sleeping pills and painkillers to keep himself going. Kennedy knows if his sickness is exposed, it could end his political career. -The best-kept secret in modern politics was probably John Kennedy's health problems. In the late 1950s, he's hospitalized nine times. Now, the public didn't know about the extent to which he was taking medications. -A great man once said the election of 1860, President Lincoln. After last-minute rehearsals, Kennedy arrives at the studio. He's about to address the biggest television audience in American history and knows it's vital that his appearance bares the harsh scrutiny of the TV cameras. -Kennedy is on steroids, and there's a certain bloated quality, and it gives him a kind of tan. What I mean is you want to quit quickly or how, how... -Yes, well, we figure when you see... Nixon is also worried about his appearance. He decides his gray suit is too light in color, and he's disappearing into the studio backdrop. His team requests that it's repainted a darker shade of gray. Bobby: Ready? -Yeah. -Jack, you're not nervous, are you? -You're making me nervous. -You'll be fine, fine, fine. -Let me see this here. As the minutes tick down to the start of the debate, Kennedy makes a clever call. -The network folks approached JFK and Nixon, and they said, "Do you want any make-up?" And Jack said "Nah, I don't need any," and Nixon, not to be outdone as a macho man, said "Well, I don't need any, either." Kennedy's team realizes that, without professional make-up, he will sweat under the hot studio lights, which could make him look ill. -Unbeknownst to Nixon, Kennedy uses make-up that his campaign has provided. -Typical Kennedy one-upmanship, Bluffing basically. -This is your five-minute call. -Okay, thank you, darling. The nation waits with bated breath for the broadcast to begin. With just minutes to go, Kennedy surprises everyone by walking out of the studio. The first ever televised presidential debate is about to start, and John F. Kennedy has left his seat. -Jack says, "I need to go to the bathroom," and he goes to the bathroom. And people are sitting in that audience, it looks like there's one candidate there. And then there is the countdown. 10, 9, 8, 7. -Nixon's wondering, is this even going to happen? Where is he? Does he, what's he doing? It's a ploy by Kennedy to unnerve his more experienced rival Richard Nixon. -Even the producers, the broadcasters were very nervous. -Lo and behold the candidate shows up, seats himself, crosses his legs, and we're off. -Moderator: Good evening. The television and radio stations of the United States and their affiliated stations are proud... After keeping Nixon waiting until the very last second, Kennedy now has just one hour to convince the American public he'll make a better President than Richard Nixon. -And now for the first opening statement by Senator John F. Kennedy. Kennedy's aides brace themselves as their man squares up to a vastly more experienced adversary. -Just imagine these two warriors are going head and head with 80, 90 million, some say 100, 120 million watched it that day. He opens by addressing the burning issue of the day, the threat of communist world domination. -In the election of 1860, Abraham Lincoln said the question was whether this nation could exist half slave or half free. In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half slave or half free. Nixon then makes a blunder. He has the reputation of being very aggressive, a political assassin, so he's been advised to tone down his performance. -The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with. -Nixon seemed inclined to agree with virtually everything that Kennedy said. -I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight. -It appeared as though the senior man was Kennedy, not Nixon, as the incumbent Vice President. It's a tactical error, and as the debate progresses, things get worse for Nixon. His lack of professional make-up begins to show. -He had kind of 5:00 shadow, and whatever make-up he had on ran, and somebody said it made him look like a sinister chipmunk. Seeing Nixon faltering, the Kennedy team presses home their advantage and demands more close-up shots of Nixon. -The aides to Nixon and Kennedy are hoping to catch one of them out in some kind of grimace or some kind of sneer or contemptuous response to what the other was saying. And they have an argument over how many of these cut-aways there will be. But things are far from clear cut. -As Senator Kennedy pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year. His experience has been different from mine. Listening on his radio is JFK's close friend. I did have a feeling Nixon was making stronger points than Kennedy. Nixon was good. He'd made a lot of speeches, so he, he was a more experienced political performer than Kennedy. -A lot of people felt that if you hear the debate on the radio, Nixon wins. He makes good strong arguments, and Kennedy's fine, but he's not quite as sharp. For those watching the debate, it's a different story. Kennedy looks the more confident candidate. -Nixon could not have looked worse. The fact that he would wear a gray suit that blended into the background and not have make-up, it was a disaster. He simply didn't look presidential. -Jack was loose as a goose and Nixon was tight as a tick. Kennedy's presentational style adds to the impression. -If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we are moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world. -He addressed his remarks to the millions of Americans who were watching it on television. That he considered to be his audience rather than to Nixon himself. -Thank you very much for permitting us to present the next President of the United States on this unique program. As the debate ends, it seems too close to call. JFK must now wait for the opinion polls to discover if the country believes he could be their next leader. -Next day, the polls begin to come in, and everything you suspected is confirmed. By a narrow margin, Kennedy has won. -The essence of the debate is that one candidate tries to outdo, out-style another, to look better, to act better, to seem more presidential. On that score, it was no contest. Kennedy defeated Nixon handily. Image has proven to count for more than experience. Nixon later says, "I should have remembered that a picture is worth a thousand words." The debate marks the arrival of the cult of youth and the dawn of a new TV age. -Thank you, guys. Okay, that's enough. -He's our guy. -The debate changes politics and TV forever. They are united forever after this. -First one out of the way. Kennedy still has a mountain to climb to convince the American people to vote for him, but he's over the first hurdle. -It really put to rest some of the questions about him as being too youthful, too inexperienced. He came out of that debate with the appearance of someone who was presidential. Two months after winning the first debate, Jack Kennedy beats Richard Nixon in the Presidential election by the narrowest of margins. Seventeen days later, his wife Jackie gives birth to their second child, a much longed-for son, John Junior. In an extraordinary triumph over adversity, chronically ill John F. Kennedy is inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States. -Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. By May 1962, he's a year into his presidency. He has everything still to lose and much to gain. Integral to Kennedy's success is his glamorous wife Jackie. She's become an international celebrity in her own right, famous for her style, charm, and good looks. -That we should cherish a language and an emotion that unite us all. Thank you. With their two beautiful children, Caroline and John Junior, the Kennedys come across as the ideal family. -Jackie Kennedy was a beautiful woman, and she was intelligent, intellectual. She was ambitious, all the things that Jack Kennedy wanted and needed. The Kennedys appear the golden couple, but there are rumors that their relationship isn't quite what it seems. ♪ ♪ President Kennedy is in New York to celebrate his 45th birthday wit a star-studded gala evening aimed at raising $1,000,000 for the Democratic Party. It will be broadcast live to the nation and is the hottest ticket in town. -It's going to be a huge birthday party at Madison Square Garden, a huge arena. -It's often said that Washington is Hollywood for ugly people. Well, that didn't apply during the Kennedy administration. The beautiful people were in both Hollywood and Washington, and it was a very happy marriage. -Can we go a little faster? I don't want to be late for the old man. JFK is heading to his first engagement of the day, to visit his father Joe, who's in the hospital, having suffered a stroke. He's been a driving force behind his son's political career but is now a shadow of his former self. -The acorn didn't fall very far from the tree in the case of John Kennedy and his father. His father had been a champion philanderer throughout his life. And, in fact had wooed Gloria Swanson among others in flagrant extra-marital affairs known to his own wife Rose Kennedy, so the pattern was set for the Kennedy boys. Jack Kennedy was quick to follow his father's example. -My wife was at school in New York as a young girl and Jack was even famous at that point for his pursuit of young ladies. Jack's friends worried that his womanizing might damage his political career. -I asked him one time, "How come you risk it all by going out with so many women?" And he looked at me a long time, and he said, "Because I can't help it." As a husband, father of two young children, and the President of the United States, Kennedy has compelling reasons to mend his ways. -John F. Kennedy took risks at every opportunity. He was as reckless a President in his personal life as America has ever had. There were dozens and dozens of women. This was simply the regular daily practice for John F. Kennedy. -I don't know how JFK had the time to be President of the United States and to have as many women as he did. There were a lot of them. Kennedy's incurable weakness for women now compels him to take a huge personal and political risk. -A man who had seen almost every woman on Earth that he wanted to, and he had to have the biggest one of all. Across town, the world's number one sex symbol, the actress Marilyn Monroe, is preparing for the performance of a lifetime, singing to the President of the United States. -There was no bigger star at the time than Marilyn Monroe, and she was America's sweetheart. -Marilyn Monroe was an American icon, and Jack Kennedy was an American icon, so I suppose it's natural that one would sing to the other. After visiting his father, President Kennedy heads to his next engagement. -Do we know how many we've got coming tonight? As he looks forward to his big night, there is one person who won't be celebrating with him, his wife Jackie. She's in Virginia, competing in a local horse show. -Jackie had known, from the day they married that JFK, like his father and other members of the family, was a serial philanderer. She never expected a perfect marriage, so it was representative of their relationship that she would spend the day with her horses while he spent the evening with the most glamorous woman in America who was not his wife. -Jackie was furious that Marilyn Monroe was headlining this event and she made sure she was not there at her husband's birthday celebration. And she made sure that people knew it. President Kennedy is about to give a speech at a new $40,000,000 housing project in Manhattan. Where he's greeted by a crowd of 20,000 people. -It is true that your distinguished president invited me to come to speak on November 3. As we were heading to a meeting which he was sponsoring three days before that election, I would have agreed to anything! In her New York apartment, Marilyn Monroe rehearses the song she has written for the President. [tune of "Thanks for the Memories"] ♪ Thanks, Mr. President ♪ ♪ For all the things you've done ♪ ♪ The battles that you've won ♪ The pair met the previous year through Kennedy's sister Patricia, who's married to actor Peter Lawford. -There really is very little doubt that President Kennedy had a physical relationship with Marilyn Monroe. There was a time, for example, when they worked together for two days in Palm Springs. Marilyn is in a fragile condition. Her third marriage has ended, and she is increasingly addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills. She has become obsessed with the President. Phone records show that Monroe made dozens of calls to the White House. Kennedy is aware of the rumors about Monroe's vulnerable state, but he still decides to give her top billing at his birthday party. And his brother Bobby, his most trusted confidante, is on hand to make it happen. -Robert Kennedy, who was his brother's Attorney General, actually phoned the Hollywood studio where Marilyn Monroe was under contract and demanded that the studio releases her for a few days and let her come to New York. The studio refuses. So Marilyn Monroe decides to go anyway, even though she risks losing her part in the movie. She spent weeks rehearsing her song and is going to wear a dress so tight, she has to be sewn into it, wearing nothing underneath. In the year before he faces re-election, the stakes could not be higher for the President. -This was about the riskiest thing you could have done at that time. To invite her to come and be seen and televised, surely seemed really tempting disaster. Kennedy is playing with fire but is prepared to take a gamble. -Jack Kennedy understands that his sex appeal is powerful, and it's one of the reasons why he got elected. He's told there's a risk, but he is a little careless about it. With the world's press gathering for his birthday gala, President Kennedy is gambling that they will turn a blind eye to his latest affair. -Kennedy's close friends in the press knew that he philandered, but they didn't want to hurt him. They liked him. The rest of the press corps heard rumors but didn't have any proof. This evening with Marilyn could light the fuse for the papers. Journalists are out in force. JFK arrives at Madison Square Garden. He's about to be serenaded by his alleged lover in front of the nation. He's risking both his marriage and his political career. ♪ ♪ President Kennedy walks into his birthday gala to be greeted by rapturous applause. -It wasn't usual for this to happen to a president, but we hadn't had a president like Kennedy before. -I think everybody was excited like I was.

In the history of show business, perhaps there has been no one female who has meant so much, who has done more than m-- -Marilyn Monroe, who was clearly high on drugs or alcohol or both, sashays onto the stage because her dress is so tight. -Mr. President, the late Marilyn Monroe. As Marilyn removes her white mink stole, the audience gasps at her figure-hugging flesh-colored dress. -All I remember about Marilyn Monroe at Madison Square Garden was her voice and her ass, because I was looking from behind, and at my age then, that was enough. -My eyes also had to be out in the audience because that's what our job is, but I couldn't help but take a peek every once in a while. All I could say is wow! ♪ Thanks, Mr. President ♪ ♪ For all the things you've done ♪ ♪ The battles that you've won ♪ ♪ The way you deal with U.S. Steel ♪ ♪ And our problems by the ton ♪ ♪ We thank you so much ♪ Everybody! -Jackie Kennedy knew that her husband had had some kind of relationship with Marilyn Monroe. So I think it would have been terribly embarrassing and humiliating for Mrs. Kennedy if she had been there. -Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. After Marilyn's breathless performance, Kennedy coolly departs from a policy speech written by the White House and goes for a more intimate response. -Thank you. I can now retire from politics after having had "Happy Birthday" sung to me in such a sweet, wholesome way. -I think he was playing up to his bad boy image and loving every minute of it because people who live on the edge are not afraid to slip off the edge. And so, this is the way to get one of the biggest highs from adrenalin possible. The gala is hailed as a triumph for Kennedy, but his advisers are concerned. At a party that night, JFK and Monroe are caught by a photographer together. The FBI seizes the prints, only one of which surfaces years later. -Kennedy got a little careless and reckless with Marilyn Monroe. Kennedy's advisors, including his brother, began to see that there was trouble brewing here, that the press was close to writing stories about Marilyn Monroe and President Kennedy. To preserve his reputation, his advisers do all they can to end his association with Monroe. -That's really the end of the relationship between President Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and at that point, she realizes that it is all over, so she goes into an utter tailspin. The night of May 19, 1962, is the last time President Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe see each other. Singing at JFK's birthday party is her final public performance. Beset with numerous personal problems, a little over two months later, Marilyn Monroe is found dead in her Hollywood apartment. -She had made a phone call to say goodbye to Peter Lawford and to tell him to say goodbye to the President and Bobby. And then shortly thereafter she was found dead of a drug overdose. Following Marilyn Monroe's tragic death, Kennedy and his wife Jackie would grow closer. -He obviously was someone who had a very complicated marriage, but I have no doubt that he loved his wife and his children and was very attached to them. But JFK, his family, America, and the world are about to face a daunting threat. The west is terrified that communists are going to take over the world. America's enemy number one is the Soviet Union with its large arsenal of nuclear weapons. -We'd been told that nuclear Armageddon was inevitable. Much of America's fear is focused on Cuba, an island just 150 kilometers away from Florida. In February 1959, the communist Fidel Castro, seized power. The Soviets promised to protect the island from the Americans. In April 1961, just four months into his presidency, Kennedy had been publicly humiliated when an American plan to overthrow Castro failed. In October 1962, the President receives news that Soviet nuclear missile bases have been detected on Cuba, putting almost every city in the U.S. within range of attack. Kennedy must now rise to the biggest challenge of his presidency. -Good evening, my fellow citizens. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere. Narrator: It's been twelve days since the missiles were discovered on Cuba, and America and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. Today is the closest the world has ever come to nuclear annihilation. President Kennedy is on his way to ExCom, the group of high-level advisers he's set up to deal with the crisis. His actions over the next 24 hours, known as Black Saturday, will determine the fate of mankind. -Gentlemen! America is on the verge of invading Cuba. -Morning. -Morning, Mr. President. Overnight, Kennedy received a letter from the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. He's agreed to remove the Soviet missiles from Cuba if the U.S. promises not to invade the island. JFK is hopeful that a solution to the crisis is within reach. -There is a little ray of light. There is some hope that there's a way out of this jam. But Kennedy's hopes of a way out are almost immediately dashed. -We've had another letter from Khrushchev. The unpredictable Khrushchev has changed his mind and is now making an impossible demand, that the United States remove its missiles based in Turkey. -When the second letter comes in, it just cast gloom on the ExCom. Basically, they're back in the soup. Turkey is an important ally of the United States, and the removal of the missiles there would leave Western Europe feeling defenseless. -These conditions are unacceptable, sir. Our allies will think we are sacrificing their security for the sake of our own. Kennedy must act fast. Military intelligence tells him that five out of six missile sites on Cuba are now operational, with Soviet weapons poised to hit U.S. cities. The military urges the President to act and bomb the bases. -We should move before it's too late. Kennedy has already placed U.S. heavy bombers on red alert, ready to move in 15 minutes if necessary. The President knows that military action will give Khrushchev no way out and could start a nuclear war. -My father also repeated the same as Kennedy. You mustn't push your counterpart into the corner because there he will push the button and start the war. Kennedy understands that Khrushchev must keep his promise to protect Cuba and will use nuclear weapons if he has to. -Kennedy must have seen a man with a great deal of pride and conviction, and that he couldn't just walk all over him. Kennedy and his team argue all morning about how to respond to Khrushchev's second letter. JFK can see that Khrushchev's offer is not unreasonable. -I just think you're going to have it very difficult to explain why we are taking hostile military action in Cuba when he's saying "You get yours out of Turkey, I'll get ours out of Cuba." As the pressure on him builds, Kennedy takes time out. Swimming relieves the pain in his back and gives him time to think. -Kennedy left the deliberations of the ExCom to go for a swim. That is not something that your average person, faced with the potential of a nuclear crisis, is going to feel they can do. No one is more aware of what's at stake than President Kennedy. He's responsible for the safety of millions of people, as well as his own family. -Jack Kennedy was not just a President. He was a father. He had a couple of little kids and had said to his brother Bob, "You know, we've lived a good life. "If war comes, we can die, but our children, they haven't had a chance to live." -He frequently mentioned the fate of the whole world, and the fact that he was the father to small children I'm sure gave a kind of immediacy to the long-range picture here. Kennedy returns to find the crisis deepening by the minute. An American U-2 plane spying on Cuba has been shot down by a Soviet missile launched from the island. The pilot has been killed. -This immensely raises the stakes. On that Black Saturday, there is a sense that, man, maybe we can't control this anymore. The Joint Chiefs press for a massive airstrike on Cuba to start the next day at dawn, followed by an invasion of the island. -The military wants to bomb. They want to get ready and get going. -Mr. President, it is imperative that we act. -He had almost every single expert saying we have to attack Cuba, putting all of this pressure on the President. I think there are few Presidents since then that you could count on to preserve their humanity during that period, and make the best decision for the United States. -This is his responsibility. He's got his finger on the nuclear trigger. He doesn't want the military chiefs to decide this. He's the one who has to make this decision. Kennedy must now make the most important choice of his lifetime, on behalf of his country, his family, the whole world. One false move could lead to a nuclear holocaust. -I need time to think. Across the country, millions of Americans are bracing themselves for the worst. -I can remember being very nervous, upset. I had nightmares. Almost everyone I knew did. We really believed that this might be the end. -This was absolutely clearly the closest that the world has ever come to having a nuclear war. JFK remarked, "It is insane that two men sitting on opposite sides of the world should be able to decide an end to civilization." Kennedy considers the option of military action. He knows he needs to act fast before the Soviets launch a surprise attack. Destroying the missile bases could be the only solution, but his experiences in the Second World War now come into play. -Here was a man who had seen up close how screwed up the military can be when he was in PT boats. -I think that his interaction with the Joint Chiefs was colored very much by his experiences in the Solomon Islands. The failed attempt to overthrow Castro is also fresh in his mind. -He's wary of the top brass, and he's not going to let himself be buffaloed into military action by people who, just because they've got some stars on their shoulders. Kennedy's determined to explore every option in order to avoid war. -Kennedy throughout this wanted peace. It's, it's very obvious that he did not want to go to war. The President has listened to all the arguments and decides to agree to a radical plan. He will completely disregard Khrushchev's second letter, which demands that the U.S. remove its weapons from Turkey. In a bold move, he's going to pretend he never received it. Instead, he will simply reply to the Russian leader's first letter and agree that the U.S. will not invade Cuba. -I think that the greatest stroke of genius that Kennedy had in the entire Cuban Missile Crisis was to ignore Khrushchev's second telegram and simply assumed it had never been sent. Kennedy's prepared to go even further to prevent war. He turns to his most trusted ally, the one person he knows he can totally rely on, the U.S. Attorney General, his younger brother Bobby. -The indispensable quiet, younger brother that people didn't see as much of, hear as much from but who was a huge force in the administration. Kennedy sends Bobby to talk secretly to the Soviet Ambassador to Washington Anatoly Dobrynin. He's instructed to tell the ambassador that the Soviets must dismantle their nuclear missile bases in Cuba, and in return, the U.S. will remove its weapons from Turkey, but this part of their agreement must remain absolutely secret. -JFK is at his Machiavellian best on Black Saturday and he makes a private deal that nobody sees behind closed doors, with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, to pull American missiles out of Turkey. That part is hidden, so it's classic Kennedy. He shows public resolve, but reasonable. Privately he makes a deal. The proposed deal has now been delivered to the Soviets. All Kennedy can do is wait for their answer. There's been no word from Khrushchev. After a sleepless night, Kennedy is dressing to go church when he hears the news. -Good morning, Mr. President. We've just heard. Khrushchev's agreed to the deal. -Thank God. Thank you, I'll see you down there. [applause] -I went with the President down to the situation room and was standing outside of the room and could hear a little noise and a few cheers. -We did it. JFK refuses to declare it a victory. He doesn't want to gloat or humiliate Khrushchev. -He came out, and he said, "Okay, pack your bags, we're going to Palm Springs." So we knew everything was okay at that time. The world had gone to what Kennedy called "the abyss of destruction." Thanks to him, it had pulled back. -JFK was much tougher than Khrushchev ever imagined until afterwards. This was a toughness borne of a lifetime of facing illness, facing death, not only in hospital, but in combat, in war. -People think that it was the finest day of his presidency because it's true. It was the finest day of his presidency. All of JFK's finest qualities as a statesman had come into play. If he never does anything else, his actions during these twenty-four hours have won him his place in history. -The most important characteristic any President can have is cool good judgment. In all of American history, we never got a better example of it than John F. Kennedy on the 27 of October. Without a President with those characteristics, there might not be a United States of America. President Kennedy has saved the free world from nuclear annihilation. But at home, African-Americans are far from free. They had colored water, white water, and the whites thought they were superior to the Blacks. The injustice of racial discrimination is at odds with everything America stands for. Kennedy has seen the country torn apart over the issue of race. In 1954, segregation in education was made illegal. In 1955, Black students are admitted to all state schools and universities in the South, in the face of fierce opposition from some whites. In 1963, the University of Alabama is the last, still refusing to admit Black students. Civil rights is an issue that divides America. If Kennedy throws his weight behind it, he risks losing critical votes in the South. Today is the day when this explosive problem comes to a head. He must now choose between politics and principle. Two Black students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, are attempting to enroll at the University of Alabama. -James was a competitive person. When he got an idea in his head, it was there until he finished it. He wanted to take these summer classes, so he was going to school. Also trying to enroll is Vivian Malone, the sister-in-law of the man who was to become U.S. Attorney General. -Vivian was a woman of great courage. But she just simply thought it was the right thing to do and that it was fundamentally unfair for her not to be able to go to that university, being as qualified as, as she was. Monitoring today's events from the White House is the President. He believes that the students have the right to attend the university. Opposing him is the Alabama state Governor, the hard-liner George Wallace. He's one of many Southern Democrats fighting desegregation and has said he's prepared to stand in the school house door to stop the Black students entering today. He'd made his position clear when he became Governor. I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever. -He had already said that he, Blacks would never enter the university. He didn't want to change. Wallace's aggressive stance puts him in direct confrontation with the President. What's more, Wallace represents the views of many white Southerners who agree with him. -George Wallace and his racist posture made it absolutely certain, once he was elected, that there was going to be a confrontation with the potential for great violence, great harm, great death. The risk for Kennedy is that, in supporting civil rights for Blacks, he will lose hundreds of thousands of votes. -John F. Kennedy knew that civil rights was the right thing to do, but he was also a politician. He looked at the election returns in 1960 and recognized that he was barely elected, and it was the electoral votes from a bunch of Southern states that put him in office. So he was concerned about moving too quickly. Many African-American feel Kennedy has been too slow in ending discrimination against them. Kennedy did not move as quickly as he might have. Today is the ultimate test of JFK's commitment to the cause of civil rights. The decisions he makes will put the future of his presidency on the line. The showdown is being broadcast to a gripped nation. -I'm so scared. Man [over television]: We are armed with a proclamation. Narrator: 14-year-old Brenda Hood and her parents watch as her brother James tries to exercise his legal right to enroll in the University of Alabama. Man [through television]: Appeals for calm. -I guess you could say that we were afraid, you know, because you don't know what's going to happen. Man: So, Tuscaloosa is under a tight security guard of state police. Narrator: President Kennedy is taking a personal interest in the students' struggle. -Do you have James with you? Put him on. -James felt President Kennedy was just like an average person because he was able to talk to him like he was a, a human being. -I just wanted to tell you we're all really proud of what you're doing down there. JFK sends his man, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, to escort James Hood and Vivian Malone as they attempt to enroll. I know that she derived great strength from the fact that the Deputy Attorney General was there. Kennedy knows there's a massive potential for conflict. There's been increasing racial violence across the South. -Let's hope this doesn't get messy. At the university witnessing events is 23-year-old student Gaines Blackwell. I thought there's always some nutcase out there that would do something with a rifle or with a bomb but I really wanted to watch. I wanted to see what was going to happen. As Katzenbach approaches the university to confront Wallace, tensions on the campus mount. -The danger of it was there are thousands of people there in Alabama whose hearts and souls and heads are right there with George Wallace, standing in the schoolhouse door. Katzenbach hands Wallace the President's order to admit the students. Man [over television]: The Governor is adamant. He made a campaign promise to stand in the doorway himself to prevent the integration of the last all-white, state university. Narrator: Wallace refuses. He then escalates the crisis. He calls up the Alabama National Guard and orders them to seal the entrances to the main university hall to prevent the students from entering. -Well gentlemen, it looks like Wallace has taken this to a whole new level. Faced with this provocation, Kennedy decides to act. He will go head to head with Wallace. -Go ahead and push the button. Kennedy takes control of the Alabama National Guard away from Wallace and places the troops under his direct command. The President's orders are that Wallace must be forced to stand down. -President Kennedy has to act on June 11 because the crisis has come to a head. He has found that he can no longer deal with Wallace and the Southerners. They're not going to be reasonable. They're not going to integrate the university. We're going to have to do it by armed troops. JFK watches as the National Guard confronts Wallace. Man [over television]: Brigadier General Henry Graham arrives to tell the governor, "It's my sad duty to ask you to step aside on orders of the President of the United States." -The conversation didn't seem to last very long, and so the question then was, what was happening? Nobody knew at the time. -What a day! Narrator: Jack Kennedy watches intently. If Wallace defies him and is arrested, the Governor's supporters could riot. -The whole world's going to be watching this. Faced with this show of strength, Wallace gives way. But the potential for violence remains as hundreds of his supporters surround the Black students' path to the university. -I was aware of Klu Klux Klan being there. So something might go bad. Then another group of marshals came walking up the same path with James Hood, and it's the first time I had seen him. Brenda Hood holds her breath as her brother approaches the entrance to the university. -There's hope that nothing happens in between that car and that door, you know, and you're praying. Dear Lord, please keep Your protective arm around our James, my brother James. -Calm. No trouble now. -James said that from the car to the door, that that was the longest walk of his life. I can understand that being a long walk and you got time to think, and you got time to say, mm, does that one has a gun or does that, you know, he have a brick or whatever. At 3:33 PM, James Hood walks into history as the first African-American to be admitted to the University of Alabama. -Yes. He's shortly followed by Vivian Malone. -They made possible many of the things that we take for granted today. I stand on their shoulders. President Barrack Obama stands on their shoulders. With the students safely enrolled, Kennedy now raises the stakes. -He knows that, since he's got all this attention, he's got really the nation's attention on this confrontation in the schoolhouse door, this is the time to strike. -Ted, get me the network. He decides to speak to the American people. -This is the time to go to the nation and make a speech that calls on really, the better angels, the conscience of the American people to do something and to end segregation. -Get me the phone. Yea, this is the President. I want to go live on air tonight. The networks agree to an 8:00 slot in just under four hours time. -Yep, make it happen. His advisers are alarmed at the gamble he's taking in speaking out about civil rights. If he loses the votes of white Southern Democrats, it could cost him the presidency. -They knew they risked losing a lot of votes in the election coming up, in 1964. Kennedy's advisers are also worried that he's left them so little time to prepare a speech on such a controversial issue. -Okay, Ted, what have you got for me? Is it finished? -Not quite. -Well, show me what you've got so far. -It's almost there. -Is this it? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Let's take a look. -I've got the last page here, okay? -"This afternoon, following a series of threats..." The speech is barely finished. With millions of Americans watching, JFK now has to deliver one of the most important performances of his life. -This nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened. -Jack Kennedy gives one of the great political speeches of all time, because it is from his heart. -We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. -He uses the word "moral." "We have a moral obligation." It has a clear purpose. He is going to end segregation. Kennedy's reading from the prepared draft but then decides to depart from it and put his case into his own words. -This is one country. It has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents. We cannot say to 10% of the population that you can't have that right. -It is a speech that's designed to go to the heart of America and talk about justice and injustice, about decency and indecency, about dignity and indignity. It's a speech that's designed to touch the heart, the hard heart of the South, the total heart of the country. -It's moving, it's emotional, it's factually correct, and to be able to do a portion of that without a text is from my perspective pretty remarkable. -This is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for, and in meeting it I ask the support of all of our citizens. Thank you very much. -It was one of those impactful moments where the culture was, there was a seismic shift in the culture. You had a President arguing our case, saying to us that these doors opening are inevitable and the Federal government will no longer retreat. June 11, 1963 marks a turning point in the battle for an end racial discrimination. President Kennedy had finally thrown his weight behind the campaign for equal rights. -He went from being merely a President to becoming a civil rights leader. He decided that he was going to take the power of his office and put it behind the civil rights struggle. -Listening to the President, we had faith. You know, you, you could feel that certain things were going to, it was going to turn around. Kennedy's civil rights speech makes him a hero to African-Americans, but alienates many Southern Democrats whose support he needs to win re-election. President John F. Kennedy has been in office for just over 1,000 days. He's confronted huge challenges at home and abroad but knows he has much more to do if he is to to fulfill his dream of transforming America into a more equal and just society. He faces re-election next year, so today he heads to Dallas, Texas, to raise funds and win over Democrats angered by his support of civil rights. 11:25 AM, November 22, 1963. President Kennedy and his wife Jackie are about to land. -He's trying to do some political bridge building. Texas is very important to his re-election in 1964. The Texas Democratic Party is split between conservatives and liberals. He's due to deliver a speech to key Democrats and business leaders at the Dallas Trade Mart, a 45-minute drive away. Their route has been published in the papers, and large crowds now line it, eager to catch a glimpse of JFK and his glamorous wife, Jackie. I was real excited because, you know, They were so popular. He was so handsome, and Mrs. Kennedy was such a beauty. -By having Jackie there, the crowds were overwhelming everywhere he went. Unusually, Jackie has agreed to accompany the President. -To everyone's surprise, when the President asked if Jackie would go with him, she said yes. She did not like grass roots politics. She was much too above that. Kennedy and his wife look happy and relaxed, but they are in mourning. Their third child Patrick died three months earlier, just two days after being born. -I think after losing Patrick, they both decided "Let's look again at our family," and they decided they needed each other because they really did care for each other. It was evident on that trip. As Kennedy's motorcade makes its way to the Trade Mart, the large crowds pose a problem for JFK's security team. -We had 34 agents on his detail. The problem is that we didn't have armored cars. We didn't have bulletproof vests. We didn't have counter-sniper teams or counter-assault teams. With the sun now shining in Dallas, two crucial decisions are made that affect the President's security. It had been raining in Texas, and they chose to remove the bubble from the President's car. Previous to that, they had the bubble on the car, but it was a very bright sunny day. The President is also keen to give the crowds the best view possible, so he asks the secret service agents not to stand on the back of the car. -Jerry: Basically, he didn't want to look like he was over-protected, so we had a shortage of agents, and then he emphasized that he didn't want agents on the back of the car. To get to the Dallas Trade Mart, the motorcade must pass through a small tree-lined square called Dealey Plaza. A young couple, Bill and Gayle Newman, decide it's the best place for them and their two small sons, Clayton and Bill, to get a good view of the President. -You could hear the crowds cheering way before they got to where we were standing, and there was just such an atmosphere. -Office workers and people were hanging out the windows, and were on the curb's edge, and it was quite a big day. Another person who has a very good view of the President's route is 24-year-old former U.S. Marine called Lee Harvey Oswald. An unhappy loner, Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union but returned to the U.S. in 1962. One month before JFK's visit, Oswald got a job working in a book warehouse which overlooks Dealey Plaza. At 12:29 PM, the Presidential motorcade turns into the plaza. Man [over radio]: It will be only a matter of minutes before he arrives at the Trade Mart. Narrator: What happens next shocks the world. President Kennedy's limo passes beneath the Texas Book Depository en route to a fundraising lunch. -I can remember seeing the President's car turn right onto Houston Street, and it was coming straight at us, and probably some 100 feet or so from us, the shot rang out. [gunshot] -Bang. -The first two sounds that I heard I thought were firecrackers. -Bill: And just as the car passed in front of us, the third shot rang out... [gunshot] ...and he went over into Mrs. Kennedy's lap. -I think I realized that President Kennedy had definitely died the minute that I saw that shot hit him in the head. -And she hollered, "Oh, my God, no, they've shot Jack." I turned to Gayle, I said "That's it, hit the ground." Bill and Gayle are caught on camera as they protect their sons. Man [over radio]: It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route. Something, I repeat, has happened. -We didn't know where the shots were coming from. We, we didn't know if other people in the crowd might have guns. People were screaming and, and, you know, running in all directions. -I think a lot of the crowd didn't realize what had actually occurred. It was unbelievable what had just happened. -There has been an attempt, as perhaps you know now, on the life of President Kennedy. He was wounded in an automobile driving from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas, along with Governor Connolly of Texas. They have been taken to Parkland Hospital there, where their condition is as yet unknown. From Dallas, Texas, the flash apparently official, President Kennedy died at 1:00 PM Central Standard Time, 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago. -And I was in my office, and a journalist came in and said, "I have something you have to see." It was the bulletin, and I flared with anger and said if this is somebody's idea of a joke, it's sick. And he burst into tears and said, "John, I wish it was." -It was like somebody had kicked you in the stomach, you know. It just took your breath away. -It was a surreal moment. I remember exactly where I was on the campus at that moment. -We were all shocked. We were in a state of shock. Man [over radio]: We don't know. Perhaps there was someone hidden in that car as well, we're not sure. -We were at home and the telephone rang, and it was the Foreign Minister Gromyko, and he told it was just announced by American radio that President is dead. And really it was very sorrow, the emotional sorrow on the face of my father. -First, I had disbelief, and mostly my attention was focused on Jackie Kennedy, who conducted herself with great courage and class. As Jackie travels back to Washington on Air Force One with her husband's body, America struggles to come to terms with the tragedy. -America lost its innocence when Kennedy died, this innocent belief that America really was this force for good in the world. We just lost this hope that our leaders could lead not just the country, but the whole world, to some kind of better place. -It was a tragic moment in the country's life. You see, the country hasn't gotten over his assassination yet. -I remember him fondly and with a great deal of amusement, and when he was killed, it was like the end of my youth, and I think of the country's youth. -My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of man. John Fitzgerald Kennedy, a boy plagued by illness who became a war hero. The first television President who changed the face of politics. A statesman who faced down his enemies abroad and had the courage to confront racism at home. His days cut tragically short, he remains forever a symbol of youth and hope. -Read the Inaugural Address of any President you want and see all the things that you've been promised and how few of them ever happened. And then read Jack Kennedy's inaugural address. He didn't promise you one damn thing. He said, "Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country." Thank you! [crowd cheering]
