Hey, when's Kana gonna wake up? Don't you know anything? When a prince comes and kisses her, bonehead. We know that, but when? How would I know? When she becomes an adult. Know when that is? When she turns 20 years old. Kana's only 16, so he won't be coming for a long time yet. NATSUKI KATO TOSHI NORI OMI TOMOKA HAYASHI SHUNGI KU UCHI DA YASUTAKA TSUTSUI Kana, thank you for taking care of my kids. STORY BY KENJI OTSUKI I know they can be a pain in the neck. Mom! Did you finish shopping, Mom? You get us any treats? I want chips! Kana! I want popcorn! Kana, stop! Directed by NAOYUKI TOMOMATSU The beginning of the 21 st century. Young girls aged 15 to 17... began dying one after another, all over the world. Even more surprisingly... the dead girls began to reawaken as zombies. I don't know who coined the term... but they began to call the zombies "Stacies. " The term was used around the world... and was even listed in dictionaries. Fire! Girls on the verge of death exhibit the tendency to become manic. In other words, they attain a pre-death state ofhappiness. NDH, or "Near Death Happiness. " Present on the skin of these Stacies is a pale blue, powdery substance. This is known as "Butterfly Twinkle Powder, "or BTP. "Inugami Kiyosuke Doctor of Brain Physiology" This powder sometimes phosphoresces. Yes, I understand that, Doctor. But why on earth is this happening? What's the cause? Cause? On the one hand... some people say the experiments carried out by the WHO and yourself... are an attempt to name an unknown phenomena. You pretend to understand the symptoms. What's your response? Well, as for the cause... And one more thing. Repeat kills. According to your reports... To carry out a repeat kill... you must dissect the body of a Stacy into 165 pieces. What reason do you give for that? I've actually done it. You have? They die when they are cut into pieces. The bodies twitch for about two hours after death. It's quite annoying. But if you cut them into 165 pieces... Are you saying that a reputable person such as yourself, a Nobel prize winner... is hacking these young girls into pieces? Fool! This is an experiment! A scientific test! From a medical, physiological... religious and literal point of view, these zombies are... nothing more than corpses! How can an idiot like yourself, who knows nothing about science... dare to tell me off! The impudence! I'll show you! BACK I N A MOMENT It's like the apocalypse. "Romero Repeat Kill Troops" Want You.! Men, take up your arms.! Kill your own daughters.! NOW RECRUITI NG And we"ll take care of ours.! Romero Repeat Kill Troops. Sanctioned by the UN to repeat kill Stacies. We recruited across the nation from among retired police officers... and self-defense personnel. The "Stacy Law"has now been passed. I heard they might make it mandatory to join the Romero Troops. That's conscription! I tell you, the apocalypse is coming. This is a new century! You will be international officials.! Realize your true potential through repeat kills.! Officials. I'd better get going. Oh, yeah? Shibukawa and Matsui, are you really gonna stay here? We don't have anywhere else to go. And I can't think of anything else to do. I'll think some more about it after I've finished making this puppet. But nobody's gonna come to a puppet show in times like these. You've got a point. Fire! "Dear brother, how are you? I'm doing great." Knock it off, Natsumi. It's no big deal! Why so embarrassed? I'll give you a copy. Why not send it to this "brother" you love? Great idea! You've gotta introduce me to this brother of yours. Yeah, me too! I'll snag me a hot boyfriend! You've already got a boyfriend, Natsumi. Over here. I'll take a shot. Say "cheese"! How many years have passed? It was before all this started, so it must be ten years ago. Do you remember? The string of murders of junior high and high school students? Yeah, so? These days men are exhausted, their eyes dark and gloomy. The only beautiful people left are the girls who are about to become Stacies. The ones affected with Near Death Happiness. The girls are beautiful and full of smiles. The population of the world, once more than six billion... has declined sharply due to girls turning into Stacies... as well as murders by the Stacies. Not to mention riots and conflict caused by social unrest. World population has been halved in just a few short years. Birth rates continue to decline... and are approaching zero growth rate in some countries. The human race faces an ordeal unlike any it has seen before. Hey, what are you doing? Stacy garbage is collected only on Friday. Why didn"t you call Romero? It isn't good for my young child's upbringing. That crap reeks! Shut up, you old bag! I've just killed my girlfriend. I don"t care if it"s on Friday or Sunday. Get off my case, or I'll do this to you, too! Nakanoi Kozo, executive of a pharmaceutical company... was arrested under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law. He allegedly was selling the medicine Steranine... which may prevent young girls from becoming zombies. Steranine contains a growth-control hormone... that has not yet been approved in Japan. Matsui? He"s gone too. Isn"t this neat? It sounds beautiful, but it's a bit sad, huh? That"s why I like it. You can buy wind chimes even when it isn't summer, you know. This puppet is like my wind chimes. It's beautiful but it looks sad. My name is Eiko. My name is written with the character for "eternity." Hi, I'm Shibukawa. Shibukawa. I'll call you Shibu-san. Shibu-san, could you repeat kill me? I'm gonna die in about a week. Then I'll become a Stacy. So I'll give you the right to repeat kill me. I'm speechless. This is kind of sudden. The weather's so nice today. I decided to find someone who would agree to repeat kill me. Shibu-san, I can tell you're very concerned... about what people think of you. That"s why you pretend not to be interested in other people... and you make so many puppets. You"re like me. You never sleep well with someone at your side, do you? I understand how you feel. So I'll make you sleep comfortably. At my side you"ll sleep in peace. That is the one thing I'll do for you... before I become a Stacy. What you can do for me is promise to repeat kill me. You're talking nonsense, Eiko. You can sleep well... only when you're with me. Your laugh changed. This way is prettier, isn"t it? Today we introduce our newest chainsaw... Bruce Campbell"s Right Hand 2. In case your daughter becomes a Stacy or you suddenly run into one. This is our mission at Inugami Institute of Corpse Resuscitation... formerly Riruka Women"s Art School. Any questions? This is our featured product today. How do you like it, Mr. Otsuki?

Don't ask questions unless absolutely necessary. You"ll soon find out. So, which of you used to be a medical student? - Me. - I can't hear you! Me! At attention! Matsui, you will guard the doctor and the facility... escort the test team to the facility... and also dispose of the waste... with Tokuyama and the assistant captain, Kasuga. Arita, you will be my assistant. Dismissed! Arita. Come to my room first. I hope he doesn"t commit suicide like the guy before him. Hey! What are you saying to the boss? Sis... - Sis... - Not "Sis." She's the captain. WANTED FOR I LLEGAL REPEAT KI LLI NG This sucks. I'm the only one that looks ugly. That's how you really look. Do you think you're cute? Of course I do! I head up the nice-looking section! Give me a break. Stop arguing about such stupid stuff. I hope I can save a million yen soon. Wait for me, Sorimachi. Don't get it all mucked up. Sorimachi's number one in the entertainment district. The competition's tough. A girl named Keiko gave him a million bucks... to get Sorimachi to repeat kill her. Piss me off! Why don"t we pay for our own ammo? Convenient for you too. Your nunchaku and sword don't need ammo. - Bullets are pricey! - You waste too many. Work on your aim. My swords don"t last long. They get damaged when I cut through fat and bone. We've gotta make more profit. We gotta make a million yen each. Before it's too late. REPEAT KI LL PAMPHLET Hello? My daughter just died. Hello, this is Kawasaki City Hall Sanitation Department. You have reached the office of the Romero Repeat Kill Troops. Office hours are from 2::00 to 5::00 p.m. Please call back during office hours. In case of emergency, please call the Emergency Department. The number is 4... 6- 4-2. Remember, that's the number to call when you have a dead Stacy. But I just called that number! Give me a break! This is ridiculous.! I connected with him! Hello, this is the Drew Illegal Repeat Kill Troops. We're very sorry about your daughter. We pray for the repose of her soul. Please give us your name and address. Who the hell are you? I told you, we're the Drew Illegal Repeat Kill Troops. Only boyfriends and families have the right to kill Stacies. So this is illegal. Don't you know anything about the Stacies Law? You're a coward who can"t repeat kill your daughter, right? Let's just leave it at that. We"re not criticizing you. Let us come and repeat kill her. We named our troops after Drew Barrymore. She's our idol. Unlike the Romero troops, we're very fast! But it"ll cost you. That"s right. Think about it, old man. The Romeros will come with their loud sirens blaring. You should have some consideration for your neighbors. How old are you girls? Sixteen... and two months. Is that a problem? Now hurry up and decide what it"ll be. Otherwise your stupid daughter will become a Stacy... and chew you to the bone! Girls of 15 and 16 Become Stacies Their tits are smoldering on the fiire Their fleshy toes are burning Hey, bro, you dropped something. Why don't you stick it on your dick for a yank? Get it off! You're an idiot! Sis. Do you read, Sis? How long? How long do we have to do this? As if I know. There's no end to it. We'll end up rotting here with the hacked-up Stacies. How come you joined Romero? No matter. My sister died. She became a Stacy. She devoured some children. And the Romero troops "repeat killed"her. And? She was my only sibling. I hear that all the time. And that's why you joined? You're hilarious! Brother.! Do you remember her? She's my good friend. Good luck. Come off it, Kana. Uh... Momo? Starting in the spring... I'm going to the Riruka Women's Art School. It's a women's college, high in the mountains. Really? If you wouldn't mind... do you think you could be my pen pal? I guess that'd be okay. You sure? Thank goodness. Even if it's just in my letters... would you mind if I called you "brother"? Brother. Momo. Once upon a time there was a boy. He had a favorite toy cat, Mitten, that he took with him everywhere. He loved it because his mother made it before she died. When he slept, ate or played, it was always at his side. They even bathed together. He loved his cat, which is why they were always together. At fiirst "Mitten"the cat was cute and shiny... but eventually it grew old and ragged. But still the boy wouldn't get rid ofhis cat Mitten. Then one day... after being together all the time, Mitten's leg fell off. So when the boy was away on a school trip... his stepmother secretly threw Mitten away. When the boy came home, he was shocked to fiind Mitten gone. Mitten! Where are you? Mitten! The boy ran outside looking for Mitten. He ran and ran until he reached... a dark and gloomy forest where all discarded toys ended up. Mitten! Where are you? Mitten! Mitten, you're all right. Thank goodness! Come on, let's go home. What's wrong? Let"s go home. Your leg is fixed. I'm so happy for you, Mitten! Did Mother fix it? I see. You're with Mother. Then you aren't lonely. Mitten. They found each other again, so it's over. Right, Shibu-san? It's over, right? Right, Shibu-san? It doesn't matter that they parted, because they found each other again. You're awake, Shibu-san! That"s amazing! You fell asleep right in front of me! I thought I'd write my wish on the paper hanging from the bell. Then you dropped your head on the desk, sound asleep! You were sure sawing logs, I tell you! You slept for a whole hour! Amazing! You fell asleep right in front of me! Shibu-san, you've really grown up! What are you talking about? What's with the outfit? I found it in the storage room, so I put it on. Was that wrong? No, it's just that you were wearing that in my dream too. If I keep writing this thing... I wonder if Matsui will get mad? Eiko: "It doesn't matter that they parted, because they found each other again." What are you doing? The old man is throwing up. Ten years ago there was a string of murders around here. Only junior high and high school students were killed. Remember? No, I keep telling you. I quit! I'm quitting Romero. You guys are nuts. Why doesn't this bother you? You kill these innocent young girls. Why doesn't it bother you? Who says it doesn"t bother us? Thank you. We like you guys. We love you. It's the truth. We honestly love you, from deep in our hearts. So... if you can find it in your hearts... try to like us too. Love us. Hey, Shibu-san. Hack me up like those girls, okay? So this is what Near Death Happiness is like. How can you laugh like that? We can laugh... "cause we're not angry! So you shouldn't feel bad. We'll forgive you for everything! I'll forgive you! And if you guys want to laugh, then go ahead and laugh. If you want to cry, then bawl your eyes out! Now I understand. These girls... should be killed by those who love them most. That's what these girls want most. To be killed by the people they love. That's what makes them happy. I killed my daughter. She was going through a rebellious stage. While I was cutting her to pieces... she fixed me with an icy stare. She was chopped up by the father she hated more than anyone. That must have disappointed her. But one thing... I loved my daughter more than anyone. I really did love her! It's okay to cry until you feel better. You're the only one not crying. Maybe if I cried I would feel better. Shibu-san, you're writing my lines. Is this gonna be a puppet show? You told me yourself. You said your name is written with the character for "eternity." If I write it down like this, your words will last an eternity. I'll make a puppet of you too. Seriously? That makes me happy! I'd love to be a beautiful puppet! I can hardly wait! CLOSED Too bad. I guess we should have called first. No problem. We'll come back again tomorrow. Think there will be a tomorrow? Are you still okay? Did you say something? Let's come back tomorrow. Your favorite subjects, Doc. I brought you some more Stacies! I can't believe I'm in a place like this! This is hell! This place is living hell! It's hell! Hell filled up so the dead come here. Is this "Dawn of the Dead" or "Day of the Dead"? What are you saying? What is this guy doing? He"s finally turned into a useless lump. You should have trained him properly, Tokuyama. Is there some problem? No. Now, where did I leave off? Oh, right. Brain waves. It's remarkable, but Stacies have brain waves, though they're weak. That"s why their corpses rouse my interest so much. By the way, those idiots in the media... don't even try to understand why it's so delightful... no, interesting. You. Double-check the name. - Her name is Natsumi. - Natsumi. They think l"m some kind of... Jack the Ripper or something. Damn them to hell! Idiots! Unenlightened fools! They don"t understand how sublime science truly is. I'll kill you. One day, I will kill you all. Watch this. This is Butterfly Twinkle Powder under an electron microscope. Isn't it beautiful? It seems like a mineral, but it"s actually made of organisms... crystallized from a constituent of body fluid. It really is fascinating! What's even more interesting... the sparkling of the BTP is linked to the Stacy's mental activity. Her mental activity? Murderous intent or stimulation of its appetite. What's the meaning of this? What's going on? What's happening? Thanks. She was a soldier in the forces. Her timing's good, unlike other punks. She joined the troops to kill girls younger and more beautiful than herself. She's a brave warrior. You can count on her! When you're done here, come to my room. How dare she come after me! This Stacy forgot her place. A spring storm. Eiko. Morning, Shibu-san. Thank God. What's wrong, Shibu-san? I thought you were... Hey, Shibu-san. Would you come shopping with me? Thanks for waiting, Shibu-san! - What did you buy? - A present! Here! A present? What is it? Come off it. You shouldn't make a girl tell. GIVEAWAY PRICE: ELECTRIC SAW 1600 YEN! B-R-U-C-E. Shibu-san, let's go to the park. I bet the botanical gardens are open today. CLOSED They're a step ahead of us. MAP TO RI RUKA WOMEN"S ART SCHOOL There are puppeteers who control corpses via psychic powers. Or this might be the work of God. It doesn"t matter what you call it. That would mean God is... people are... nothing more than a puppeteer and his puppets. He lives on some faraway planet... and transforms girls between 15 and 17 into revived dead bodies... to make us suffer. And there"s no reason for it. It's nothing more than a whim! It's just a whim! Puppeteers love such whims! What's going on? What on earth? Don"t get horny, you kids! What's going on? Should be an easy job. Which girl is it? Someone asked us to repeat kill their daughter "cause they feel bad for her! If they really feel bad, they should do it themselves! Go to hell! Don"t waste the bullets! Just stop them from walking! I know that! Don't tell me what to do! - What's the situation? - We don't have nearly enough ammo! Don't just stand there! Help us! Momo. I have to help you. I wasn't able to help my little sister Kana... so the least I can do is help Momo. That's the reason I'm here. Snap out of it! We have to survive. We have to stop them in their tracks. Captain, please go to the warehouse and get ammo. There should be an 88mm trench mortar, too. Got it. Come on, Arita! I'm counting on you, Arita! I'm sure she's a cute girl. Tell me about her when this is over. Well, we got paid well. We have enough money now. Right. Now we have enough to pay Sorimachi to repeat kill all of us. Let's find her! Where are you going? - The warehouse is that way. - It's no use. We've got to escape. Come on. Sorry. It's not loaded. What's taking them so long with the ammo? They're coming back, aren't they? - It's okay. - What's okay? If she doesn't come back... I know you loved the captain. But I love you! What are you saying, idiot? I'd be happy to die with you. Stop talking nonsense! You're embarrassing me. Brother. I can call you that, can't I? Brother. Momo. It's been extremely noisy out there. What are you people doing? Sorry. That's her, all right. Who are you? You're not Momo's friends. Hold it! What are you thinking? Protecting a Stacy is a crime. We can legally kill you now. I know it's a crime. But I don't care. I'm taking Momo with me and running away! You're an idiot! She's turned into a Stacy. She isn't your Momo anymore! Momo is Momo. There are some things you can't have, no matter how hard you wish. What would you do with her? Prop her up? Buy a cat? Meow, meow! There's no way out of it. You can't do anything about it, so give up! We're going to die soon too. Then we'll become Stacies. But so what? If you've got time enough to cry or be mad or laugh... then accept your fate! You've gotta do what you can! What's with the clothes? Clothes don't matter to Stacies. It's as stupid as dressing up a pet. This is Near Death Happiness. Shut up! Hey, Nozomi. Let's do the job so we can collect our fee. Drew Illegal Repeat Kill Troops. Nozomi, Kanae and Tamae! Drop your weapons and surrender. What's going on with you people? If you're not going to help, at least don't get in the way! How many times have I told you? My research is extremely important, yet you don't even try to understand. For God's sake... All right, then! We'll surrender! I understand. I'll overlook your crime. Nozomi. You've fallen in love with this guy, right? You're always falling for someone. Gimme a break. Let's do it. What's the story with that Stacy? This is Dr. Inugami"s brain physiology lab, isn"t it? - Is she a subject? - No. She's my lover. Lucky her. I wanted someone to hold me like that... when I was dying. I must have been shot in the chest. Ten years ago there was a string of student murders. Did you know that? I guess you couldn't know. That was before you girls were in junior high. You were the one who did it. You must have been lonely. Did you love them? Or did you want them to love you? It's okay. Nobody blames you. And no one suspects you. The girls you killed... probably loved you. I feel the same about you. - I love you. - I love you. I love you. It's okay to cry until you feel better. Now I understand. What brings you to life is... I see! Is this what makes you move? No, it can't be. That's ludicrous. Still... it must be true! It's love. It's not murderous intent or appetite. It's love! You want to be loved. You wander after your death in order to find love. You devour people for their love? I love you. Do you actually love this old man? My lovers! My beloved daughters! We can just walk around until dawn, can't we? Inside the botanical gardens... Ioneliness just melted away little by little. I think right now I'm at my prettiest. I went to the botanical gardens with my twin sister. Poor girl. She was kind and beautiful. But no one noticed that. They never notice. They don"t understand. They"ll never understand.! Only you can understand. When you are sad, she is happy. One spring night, at the foot of the temple... were two identical twin girls. They were playing catch. It didn't look like a game, but rather like killing each other. Throwing a ball to each other the color ofblood. A game oflaughter and tears. Shibu-san. The memories of that girl. What a fool you don"t tell others... about your sister's feelings... of anger and pain? Has this society intimidated you? Tell them. Tell them. Tell them. Tell people only what you want to. Right now... tell people how beautiful her soul is. It's okay. You can do it. You're a missionary. It"s not a game. It"s like killing each other, though it looks like playing catch. You can just walk around until dawn. Inside the botanical gardens... my loneliness just melted away... little by little. I think... that right now... I'm at my prettiest. I'm at my prettiest. "Thank you. L"m sorry. I love you." Thank you. l"m sorry. I love you. Hey, Eiko. It was sad saying good-bye to you... but we found each other again, so the story"s over, right? Thank you. l"m sorry. I love you. It was decades after the fiirst Stacy... appeared in the world. Suddenly they stopped pursuing people. Men became able to love the Stacies... and children were born. The children born from the union between men and Stacies... were unlike any humans up to that point. They were a different species. They say it was the fiinal stage in the evolution of the human species. And this new species ofhumans... eventually took over the world... and began its reign. In that new age... there was a book that became a new bible. Matsui's and my script. "The Boy, Mitten, and Eiko. " It was over 5,000 pages long. A story oflove. It became a guide for the future... for the new civilization to live in the new age. "Thank you. I'm sorry. I love you." And the world... was bound together by love.
