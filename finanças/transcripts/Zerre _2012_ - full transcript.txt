THE PARTICLE - Ironers have worked the weekend. - It will soon be our turn to. I haven't seen my kid for a week. Always asleep when I get home. Same with my kids. And also they don't pay, no food left at home. They won't pay the wages this week as well. - Who said that? - I've heard so... If you are done eating, back to work. Don't linger about! They will fire newcomers just to avoid insuring them. I will go and say if they don't pay us, we all will leave off work. In that case they can do nothing. Should we go together? No pain no gain. Don't be cowards, come and claim your rights. I'll come by, too. We'll talk for all of us. It' better if we go more crowded. Sure. Who else would come? You, get out. Come on, come on. You, too. Come on, come on. You, too. Out. Out you go, come on. - What is the matter? - Come on. Out. Leave me alone. I am working. What is it? Let me go. I'm working. I have no problems. - Get up! Come on! - I am working! - Get out. Scoot! - I have nothing to do with them. - Come on, get out of here. - All right, fine. - Walk on! - OK! Let me go. Let go off me. Give me my stuff. - How are you, sister? - Fine. Is there anything for me? Yes, I'll bring them right away. Today, we ran out of meals fast. I could set aside... only a little bit for you. No problem. - Would you like a tea? - No. I am leaving, anyways. - See you. - See you later. - Mom, how was G?l?in? - Fine. What have they cooked today? I don't know. Haven't checked yet. How are you doing today, my sweet daughter, my dear G?l?in? We are quite hungry. Let me prepare the meal. Let me make your hair nicely. Mom, did you take G?l?in for a walk today? Yes, I did. She doesn't want to walk much. You will force her to walk. No matter what, whether she cries or falls! It is string beans again. Don't they ever cook pilaf? She has to walk every day. How many times we have talked about this. Mom, did you spread the newspaper? Let me do that, mom. You take care of G?l?in. Okay, you do it then. I cannot bend down. This meal turned out poorly. I would have cooked it better. They fired me. Did you at get your daily wage? Nope. Would they hire you back if you talk to them? No. If only you could get a job at the municipality, but you do not try! Okay, mom, OK. Hold here. Don't move, stop. Let's wash your mouth, too. Well done. That's it. That's all. Zeynep, is it the call to the prayer for funeral? Would you turn down the television a bit? Yes. Come on sweetie... Are there any lavender bundles? Did you prepare any? I prepared two or three. I don't remember. Check the cupboard. Sit down, my dear... Good girl. - Are there any? - I don't know. Let me check. Yes, there are three of them. That's good. Remziye Eren has passed away. Her funeral will be held at Merkez Mosque. May whoever died rest in peace. Hold this, my dear. Good, their fragrance has not faded away in the bag. You prepare some more later. From now on, I will go again. Okay, I will. You won't make it on time. I will. Okay, I am off. - Zeynep! Not even a hello? - I got fired; I don't have any money. Enough! You became a toruble. Leave my house! - Where should we go to? - Fuck off! You neither leave, nor pay. Go be a whore! I don't care. You think it is your daddy's home? Find me a job and I'll work. I did. If you want, I can call the doctor. Keep away from us. Remzi, take these, I am in a hurry. I'll see you tonight. - A water please. - Sure. - Ay?e. - Zeyno. - May it be easy. - Come on in. - What are you doing here at this hour? - They fired us. - No way! It's been so hard to find it. - That's the way it is. Don't you worry. We'll find something. Two tickets. You keep on looking for a job. If you could arrange that job at the municipality... Sure, but you know you need money for that. Yet, I will still talk to Sedat about it. Have a look around here. There surely will be some jobs. Okay, I'll ask around. I am leaving now. You are busy, anyway. All right, honey. Drop by again, okay? Okay. I am leaving this lavender bundle here. It smells good. Don't leave your stock here, go and sell it. We prepare them with mom. I could not sell much today, anyways. See you later. Okay. Tell my regards to your mom. - Good afternoon - How may I help you? - Any jobs around here? - Not much of a chance. I have previously worked at a haberdashery shop. - You ask around then. - All right. May it be easy. Chief, I'll be right back. You are late this morning, sis. I quit my job. - You don't say! - It just is. Never mind. May I just take the meals and go? There is no food left today. - Nothing? - I swear to God. Okay, I'll buy some from the grocery store. I am leaving the bowls here... - for tomorrow. - Okay. Remzi, do you know any jobs around here for me? You know it is hard these days. If only I could get away from here... I mean, I can work any odd jobs. - Remzi! -I have to go now... - Okay, you go then. Two breads and half a kilogram of tomatoes. - Let me wrap up your bread. - And eggs. - How many? - Five. How much is the chocolate? 40 Kuru?. - Two chocolates. - Sure. Come on, G?l?in. Eat your bread. Come on. Let me have a look. Hold this, honey. You could have given her a bath during day-time tomorrow. She won't be cold under the duvets at night. She's out in the open all day. - Remzi, I'll take the bowls later. - I'll bring them tonight. Today, meals are quite good. Okay. Take extra, we'll eat together. - Okay. I missed mom and G?l?in, anyways. - All right then. - We are not in need of any workers. - In the kitchen, for dishes maybe? We have hired someone recently; We do not need anyone else. Fine. Have a nice day. Hello. There really are no rentals for that price. There is this one... with two rooms, but it is 450. A small one, single room can work. You know the city demolishes many buildings around here. Yes. There is this one room for 250. The tenant will evacuate next week... but it needs some work. No problem. I will come by next week then. Okay. - Have a good day. - You, too. - Remzi, no jobs at your kitchen? - Unfortunately, sis. Business is slack nowadays. I hope to leave for France soon, too. - You've been hoping that forever. - Don't say so, mom, it is difficult. If I ever manage to go... They say the wages are paid on time every month. No delays and many jobs. A lot of food out there... - Your brother lives there, right? - No, my uncle. - When will you go? - He's establishing his own business. He told me that as soon as he pays off his debts, he'll get me there. Good. Dinner is ready! Wait for it to cool a bit. Okay? Why don't you sell the lavender bundles on the streets? - They don't let me. - Who? The municipality? - Yes. I have already tried it. - They took away many of her bundles. They only let it at the mosque. With the crowd and all they let us slip by. But that is not stable job, sis. Someone has to die for you to go... to the mosque and sell. A long shot at best! What can I do? Besides, I cannot shout out so end up selling two or three. When I go to France, I will take you all with me. I'll get it. What is going on? I came to visit. Be quite, there is my kid. You come to the door now? Listen, you may stay at my house until it is demolished. All you have to do is give blood. The rest is easy. You can pay off your debt and even have some extra. - Zeynep, who is it? - No one, mom. I am coming. Go! - What is it? - Nothing. Go back inside. - How many of you live here? - They will leave when they find a place. You have money, do you still want more? Go away now. Fine. This is how their kind is. Show some teeth and the cowards scoot right away. Do not mess with him, son. He is not of your kind. Don't worry, mom. He can do nothing. He dares come for he knows... there is not a man in the house. Crazy, that man is crazy. - G?l?in, my daughter! - Zeynep! - What the hell have you done? - Now live here as you like. God damn you! He broke down the door. Look at this mess. - Sis, is your nose bleeding? - Move. Don't be scared, G?l?in. Mom, why don't you take the kid inside? Okay. Remzi, would you take this television aside to clear the path. Faggot! He broke down and ran away. Mom, do you have rope? Yes. In the cupboard across, in the box. Okay. You see this? You roll this through to the other side. Then you attach this piece of elastic band under the nail. Thereafter, you pass this rope over that. And then, you do like this! See! When you pull, it goes in, okay? Then I passed this through here as well. Let me see from the outside. All right. - You see? Let me look at it again. - Okay. - Open it up. - Just a second. You need to attach it to that. - Mom? - All right, I got it. - Pass that through... - Wait, I got it. - Try again. - Is it okay now? Okay, do it now. I got it. Now you do not need keys anymore. - Will that hole remain as such? - Yes. New keys would cost a lot. Until I arrange something, you'll make do with this. - Is it solid? - Solid. Better than before. Okay then. Everyone inside. I'll sweep here. Okay, all right. He won't leave us alone. Should we go to the police? What are you talking about?! Remzi, do you have any? Money? Yes. I have 40 liras. You can have it all. No. 20 Liras will do. - How much are these? - One lira. They all smell the same. Thanks. He is not normal. He goes crazy when he drinks. Rakes up the past; One said this, one said that. He knows it all. Raking over the ashes of the past. What good is that for anyone? Don't buy him booze, then. He finds it anyhow. Kids, us, we work like dogs... What did you do about the door? It stays as the way Remzi fixed it. He left it just like that. On my way to work, there was this crowd in a queue. Probably a job... at the factory. Take a look. Sure. I have very little money left. Where was it? On the parallel street. You know the Temiz dairy shut down? I know. - That is the place. - All right, I'll go tomorrow morning. Maybe it pays good. I will work like a dog if I find a job. Check it out. May turn out to be something good. - Where are you going? - Just gonna take a look. Get in the line; They take in turns. - Any previous experience in textile? - Yes. I worked in ?ukurova for 2 years. - You have experience in textile, then? - Yes. I have. - Okay. Do you have experience? - Yes. - What is your name and surname? - Zeynep S?nmez. - Do you know about the job? - No. Do you have any previous experience in textile? - Worked at ironing and washing. - OK. You'll go to a factory in Thrace. Be here tomorrow at seven. A bus will take you there. Take some stuff. - How much do they pay for a day? - 90 liras for a week. Do you want the job or not? Tell me. There is a line of people waiting. - Zeynep S?nmez. - Write it down. - Go on! - Okay, fine. - I filled the bowls to the brim. - Thank you. - How about the door, is it solid? - Fine enough, it holds. I found a job in a factory. Where? In Thrace. I'll go stay there. For now, until I get a job at the municipality. - How much money do they pay? - 90 Liras. - Per day? - No, weekly. Good. Better than mine. What about mom and G?l?in? I was gonna talk to you about that. Would you stay at our place for 3... or 4 nights and take care of them? Sure, sis, of course. When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. Okay, I will go to your place tomorrow night, then. I'll always be thinking about them. Look after them. - With pleasure. - Fine, then. I will call you at the restaurant. All right, deal. - Zeynep? - Yes, it is me, mom. - How are you? - We are fine. I made pasta. Should I heat it up? Good. Remzi gave some food as well. We'll eat. I went to a job interview today. - At the municipality? - No. A factory. In Thrace. - And? - Temporary, until the municipality. - Such a long ride to come and go... - No. I need to stay there. - How? - I will stay there 3 to 4 days. Remzi will come and stay with you. What can I do, mom? It is the only job I could find. Okay. I have said nothing. I shall heat up the meal. Aleyna O?uz. Recep Orkun. Berfin ?z. Asl? G?kg?z. Zeynep S?nmez. Ebru Y?ld?z. Elif Aksoylu.

For how long have you been here? A month. Why are you hiding the glasses? Thanks. Do they pay the wages on time? Yeah, they're never late. Good. They don't pay much. Bring it back, okay? Even so, you will like it here. This place is trembling. Anyone who knows how to wrap the thread around the machine? Anyone who can use a wrapping machine? Why on earth have you brought these people here? Hasan picked them up. I used the machine before, but for only a little while. - I know a little bit as well. - Good. Place these by the machine.

Isn't the pay too low for this job? It is, but what to do? People would work for half that wage. Would you give me a cigarette? I saw a rat in the dorm last night. The pillows stink, too. I felt the same way when I first got here, but you'll get used to it. If we could transfer to the other department, they pay more. - Where? - The other department. Wages are 30 liras higher. I will transfer to that department. Where should one apply? It is not that easy. First, you should get to know the foremen. We'll go together tonight. Zeynep! Zeynep, come on, wake up!

Come on, come on. - You are one of the newcomers, right? - Yes. From Istanbul. I have worked there, I know that place very well. - Not so many jobs left in Istanbul. - Business moved to this area. There is work for everyone here. I hope so. M?mtaz, why don't you give the ladies new bed-linens for a clean sleep. - Sure, chief. - It would be very good. In the room, there are many. You can come and choose yourself. Come on, grab a couple. - These are clean. Flowery. - Fine. Okay. You may use them. I'll take them there. Here. I want to go, I am very tired. - Why? - I am very tired. - You just came. - Still... - Come whenever you want. - Okay. - Let me take you to the dorm. - No need. I can go by myself. Go on, don't leave her alone. - Hey, wait! - Let go! Let me go, jerk! Let go off me! - I said let go. - OK, fine! Let go! Let go! Have a good appetite. - You did not stay last night. - I did not. The foreman... assaulted me in the corridor. So what? You just be nice to him. You are far from home, who is to see? No, I can't do it. May I borrow your mobile again? I don't have much credit. - Is the chief not here? - No. - I want to make a phone call. - To your husband? - Home. - Go for it. So, when will we pick up where we left off last night?

Do not let anyone in, okay? I am coming now, immediately. Please! Remzi, please just do as I said. Hey, where are you going? - Where is G?l?in? - Hush! She is here. I told you that she is fine. Why have you got so anxious? Haven't I told you that she would be so worried? - What did they do, mom? - They didn't do anything, honey. They examined her and took her blood. They visit the whole neighborhood. There is no one left in the neighborhood! - They did it for free, no charges. - Never mind. From now on, you are not going to let anyone in the house, okay? OK, honey, okay. That's it. Close your eyes. Lean your head back. That is it. What, water just got into your ear? We can take it out later. Good girl. That is it. Mom! Come and take G?l?in before she gets cold. What kind of a man are you?! You are after my kid now? Kids are everywhere. You can have a new one. All right. What? Okay, let's go. Necmi, are you there, today? All right. I want extra money as well. Fine. Let's go. Take another deep breath. Okay. Tomorrow, bring the x-rays, too. - Welcome. - Thanks. - Is this our patient? - Yes. - Does she know the details? - No. Come with me. Please lean back. Roll up your sleeve. - When was the last time you ate? - Last night. - You have not eaten today, right? - No, I haven't. Okay, press down firmly. May I have it? Thank you, you can leave now. Get well soon. - Who is it gonna be for? - It will be sent abroad. We'll know after the tissue compatibility is established. Kudret, come with me for a sec. You will stay in hospital for a while. Take this for now. We'll settle the rest, later. - May it be easy. - Thanks. Welcome, come on in. - No. I just wanted to say hi. - Good. Come in, let's have tea. No thanks. Do you remember that job, the dish washing? - Didn't you go to the factory? - The pay was too low. And it was a messed up place. That job was in the bazaar, yet it was available way back. Any news from the municipality? I will have some money soon. Can we arrange something? Where did you get the money? Lavender bundles. I will sell a whole bunch to a buyer. - Of course, I will talk about it. - Okay, thanks. I'd go now. Okay. See you later. Remzi, here you are. - How are you? - Fine. - Take this. - What is this? You lent me a few days ago. - There are 30 liras here. - Keep it. You probably don't have. - Did you find a job? - Kind of. There is a funeral at the mosque. Take a look if you want. I don't have the lavender bundles with me. Pray for that job... with the municipality turns out fine. I hope so, God willing. - May it be easy. I should go now. - Thank you. This is the job. The aprons are over there. Start right away to finish in time. Come by early in the morning. Okay. ?zge Yalta Editing & Subtitles: Ebru Karde?ler
