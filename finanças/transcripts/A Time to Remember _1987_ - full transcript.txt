We don't have many more rehearsals left. Oh and Angelo, Angelo Villano. Can you wait a moment I wanna talk to ya. - [Angelo] Is everything all right Father? - Oh of course it is I just want to tell you the good news. Next week you and I have an appointment with someone who is very interested in your future. - Who might that be, Father? - Now don't you be worrying your head about that now. You'll know soon enough. Let's just say he's a patron of the arts, especially opera. Oh Angelo, God has blessed you with a very beautiful gift. You must use it wisely, you must always take care of it. The voice is like life, it is God's to give or to take. - I realize this, Father. I hope that someday my dream will come true and I will be able to sing like Mario Lanza. - Ah, you will, you will. Now you go on and play with your friends. We'll practice again tomorrow. Oh God love him, he will sing as good as Lanza. Or maybe even Caruso if I have anything to say about it. If we have anything to say about it. (train horn blowing) - Here comes the meatball. Now all together. (train whistle blowing) - Hey Angela, wanna have a snowball fight? - [Little John] Yeah what'd ya say, sissy? - Yeah Caruso, we won't hurt ya. Who you looking for, Angelo, Father Walsh? - [Little John] Hey Billy what do you think? He'd rather sing than have a snow ball fight, or play football. - [Billy] You're right Little John, he'd probably fall apart. - Come on. - [Little John] Come on let's go, to heck with him. - Yeah go on chicken, get lost. I forgot sissies don't play football. - [Angelo] I'm not a sissy. - [Little John] Once a sissy, always a sissy. - [Angelo] I'm not a sissy. - [Man] The forecast for tonight, snow squalls with a temperature of 24 degrees.

(Angelo crying) - What's the matter? (speaking foreign language) What's the matter? - [Angelo] Mama, Mama Theresa, I'm not a sissy. - Sissy, (speaking in foreign language) sissy. I know not what a sissy is. - Why can't I be like the other boys? Ever since Mama died, even Papa treats me like a little child. Like they say, a sissy. - Angelo, you're no sissy. I don't know what a sissy is but you're no sissy, no. You're a very special boy, and your father, your father loves you. - I don't want to be a coward. I want to grow up and be a man. - You're no coward, you're gonna grow up soon enough. Now listen, you want me to talk to your Papa? - Please Mama Theresa, don't tell Papa. - Well then I'm gonna tell Father Walsh- - And don't say anything to Father Walsh please. - Yeah but I don't want them to bother you. They're jealous, that's what's the matter. But I promise you, I promise I won't say nothing. - Promise? - Promise, you're such a good boy, Angelo. I tell you what, you forget about everything that happened. You forget about those boys, and you sing. All right, you sing for Grandma? And Grandma's gonna make you a beautiful scarf. So you go sing for Grandma, okay? (operatic music) (singing in foreign language) Come here. Oh my dear Angelo, someday the world will pay to hear you sing. - [Mr. Nicoli] I will work with this young voice. And if it becomes a big voice, then Rosetti will polish it. The money to me means nothing. But the singing, that's everything. (chuckling) The dreams of youth, not everyone is blessed with the gift of Caruso, and now Mario Lanza. Let me tell Father Walsh, you've done a good job with this boy, now I look forward to working with him. - Oh speaking of our little protege, where is he? He was around here a little while ago. - Oh don't worry about him, Father. He can't be very far away, it's a large house. Here's our young singer, Father. - Forgive me Father, forgive me, Mr. Nicoli. - That's all right, Angelo. - Mr. Nicoli, you know Mario Lanza? - Yes, we are good friends. - He is my idol, someday I hope to sing like him. - Perhaps someday you will. (clock chiming) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Angelo] Papa, you forgot your lunch. - Oh thank goodness you brought it. I hope Grandma made something good. She make me meatballs this time? - Papa I gotta sing. - Angelo, we talked about that, didn't we, huh? Now come one, I don't want to talk about it no more, please. - Mr. Nicoli's gonna coach me in singing, and Father Walsh. - Angelo listen, you don't need a singing coach. What you need is a football coach. You understand now? You been spending too much time with those priest, you know that? - But Papa, Mama Theresa and Mr. Nicoli, and Father Walsh. - Mama Theresa, Grandma, and Father Walsh, they keep filling your head with this singing, singing. I mean come on singing ain't gonna put bread on the table. You understand? How you gonna make a living being a singer? - I can do it Papa, I can be a good singer. - Angelo, let me tell you something, I'm your father. Now you see these? This, this is what puts bread on the table. This is good hard man's work. You can't make a living singing. Why don't you believe me, huh? Come on, stop looking at me like that. Look, you wanna be a singer, go ahead, go be a singer, go ahead, listen to Grandma, listen to Father Walsh, let them fill your head with pipe dreams, go ahead. Go ahead, get out of here. Go be a singer. (somber piano music) - [Angelo] My Papa doesn't want me to be a singer. He wants me to grow up like him and work in that dirty old foundry. - Come on Angelo, who cares? Don't be that way, Father Walsh will talk to him you'll see. - No it's true, it's just like my Grandma said, he's just too thick. - You're making a Federal case out of this. - Now if he makes me stop singing for Mr. Nicoli, I'll hate him. - [Kelly] Don't talk that way, you can't hate him. He's your father. (piano music) ♪ Christmas can be every day ♪ - Ah, that was beautiful, Angelo. Gonna miss you, you know? - I'll miss you too, Father. - Yeah well, we've had a lot of fun rehearsing together. But I've gone as far as I can go, now it's up to Mr. Nicoli. Well what's the matter, Angelo? Surely you're not unhappy with the opportunity he's given you? - No it's not that, it's my Papa. He doesn't want me to be a singer. - Now what kind of a crazy notion is that? Why doesn't he want you to use the beautiful gift the Good Lord has given you? - He wants me to play football, be like the other boys, and forget about singing. He feels I'm wasting me time. - Oh he does, does he now? - "Grow up, Angelo," he says, "Grow up." I am grown up, ain't I, Father? - Why of course you are. But you must respect your father. If the Good Lord wants you to sing, he'll make your father understand that. - [Angelo] Why do you love me? - Why, because...

Now you got this Nicoli who's gonna be his coach. - And what do you want to him to do, play football? - Yeah, what's wrong with football? - Oh sure football, it's all you know football. Hey, hey, you mark my words. If you don't listen to me, and you don't let this boy sing, God is gonna punish you, severe, severe! - Look look, I know you mean well. - What do you know, what do you know? - I know one thing, this kid is no Mario Lanza. I know that. And you keep filling his head with this singing stuff. I mean you gotta get realistic here. Sooner or later, you understand, Ma? - Hey you with your football, hey. This boy is very special, you know your wife, she was right. This is a very special gift this baby has. - What's with this special boy, special boy? Everybody's special, all the Villano's are special. I was special, my father was special, and now my son. And in the meantime we all had to work for a living. When is it gonna stop? This kid's no Mario Lanza, Ma. Don't you understand that? - Your wife, she was very right. She was right, if she were here now, she'd give you an (speaking in foreign language). - Yeah my wife, you and my wife, Father Walsh, everybody knows what's best for my son. - Your wife was right, that's right. He's a very special boy. If she were here she'd give you an (speaking in foreign language). - Ma, would do me a favor, Ma? Would you talk English? We're in America now, and another thing. Will you let my son grow up? - Hey, if you don't like it, this is my house. (speaking in foreign language) Take a walk. (light orchestral music) - Ma, where's my son? - Coming in, he's coming. He's on his way home. - [Frank] This nonsense with Angelo and this singing has gotta to stop. (piano music) - That is one of the songs in "The Great Caruso" with Mario Lanza. - Did you know it was one of the first recordings made by Caruso? - I'm going back to see it again. (piano music) - Angelo, get your coat, we're going home. - Papa, what's wrong, what are you doing here? - Mr. Villano, what's the matter, what are you doing? - What am I doing? I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm gonna take my son home, and I'm gonna make a man out of him. This singing is for sissies who sit around pianos with nice clean hands. - Don't do this to me. (somber violin music) - You sent for me, Mrs. Villano? - Yes, Father. - What is it now? - Oh something terrible has happened. Oh my son Francesco he did a terrible thing. - What what? - He's gonna break Angelo's heart. He went to Mr. Nicoli's house the other night. And he pulled him out of the house while he was singing. - He pulled him out of the house? - Yes, he's acting like a crazy man since his wife died. - Oh no no, he's not crazy. You see he just, well he wants what's best for the boy, that's all. - He's too angry, he doesn't listen to anybody. I hope he listens to you. - He will listen, I promise. You see now Frank, Frank he's a good man. - If you can talk to him, I'd appreciate it. - I had a talk with Angelo and I intend to talk to Frank. - But he's so thick headed, Father, he's got a head like a bull. - Do you have faith and trust in the Lord? - Oh. - Well then would you pay me the same courtesy and have a little faith and trust in me? It'll help a little bit you know? - It's a gift. - Mrs. Villano, he can't take God's gift away. - My Angelo loves you very much, Father. If you help us I'd appreciate it very much. - Angelo's a wonderful boy, you gotta a lot to be proud of there. Now please, I've said to have faith and trust that everything's gonna be all right. - All right, thank you Father. - All right. - [Mama Theresa] Good. - God bless you, darling. Come on. No more football. - No more football please, no more. - I'll take care of it now please, God bless you. - Thank you, bye bye. - I'll bet you Mario Lanza's Papa didn't stop him from taking singing lessons. Some day I'm gonna sing just like him. - I got an idea. - What's that? - [Kelly] Why don't you get your father to come to see this picture? - Are you kidding? - No I'm serious, maybe it would help change his mind about the singing. - He won't change his mind. All I hear from him now is singing is for sissies. - He don't mean that. - Oh yes he does, and I ain't gonna forget it. - Don't be that way, Angelo. Maybe if he sees it he'll understand how you feel. - You really think so? - Can't hurt to try, what have you got to lose? - That's not a bad idea. Friday night he usually goes out for a few beers after work. - [Kelly] Well then, you can go get him later and bring him here. - [Angelo] You're right, I should. (accordion music) - [Bartender] Hey Villano, look who's here. - What are you doing here? Go on get out of here, you know better than to come in here. What are trying to do, you want to embarrass me in front of my friends? Come on get out of here, go. - Please Papa I have to talk to you. - Did your Grandmother send you here to find me? Is anything wrong? - No it's not that, I just wanted to- - Want to what? - I wanted to talk to you. - About what? If it's about that singing business I told you, I don't want to talk about it no more. Now come on, fix that hat. - Come on Frank, let the kid sing. - [Bartender] One song, Frank. - Hey he's gotta go home, the kid can't stay. - [Bartender] One song. - No he's gotta go. - [Patron] Hey Frank let the kid sing. Go on give us a song, kid. - Nah the kid can't stay, he's gotta go home. He can't stay here. - [Patron] Try it, Angelo, one small song. (singing in foreign language) (door closes) - What's going on, Frank, what's the child doing here? - Please Father Walsh, I can explain. I came here to talk to my Papa, but he told me to go home. And the people here, they wanted me to sing. - Yeah, but this is no place for a child. As a matter of fact it's hardly a place for these so called grown ups. - I'm sorry Father, but the boys telling the truth. I mean that's the way it happened. - I realize that, now it's you I been wanting to talk to. - Father look, if it's about this singing business, or this Mr. Nicoli guy, look my mind is made up. You know I really don't want to talk about it anymore. Now I don't mean no disrespect or anything Father, you understand that. - Yeah, be that as it may. But this is neither the time nor the place to discuss it. So I'd appreciate talking to you either in your home or in the rectory. - Okay, whatever you say, Father. But you gotta remember I am the boy's father, and I gotta do what I think is right. - Why of course you do, Frank. That's why you'll be starting to take him home right now.

St. Michael's is blessed with talent. Good evening Father, I'm sorry I wasn't here when you arrived. - No trouble at all Father, I sort of let myself in with the help your fine housekeeper. - Well I had a bit of a problem in town that took me a little longer than I anticipated. His Excellency told me about your arrival. He reminded me again, you know he thinks I'm losing my mind or something, please sit down. - Thank you. - It's nice to see you. - I hope you don't mind me playing on your piano. It was sort of laughing up at me and saying come on and play me, and I couldn't resist. By the way I hear you have a very fine choir here in St. Michael's. - Ah yes yes, in all humility I'd say the best. And we got one boy here, Angelo, Angelo Villano. He's got a voice like you never heard in your life. - So I've been told, Father. - Yeah just fantastic. Yeah but there's the problem. You see his father is dead set against the boy singing, I can't get to him. - How's that, Father? - Well Mr. Villano he's a good man, and he loves the boy dearly, but he's got this crazy notion that if he sings it's gonna sissify him. And he wants him to grow up to be rough and tumble like he is. - Is there anything I could do? You know Father, when I was a young lad back in Arama I too wanted to be a singer. But we can't always have what we want in this life. It's what we're given to do, maybe I could help. - Well I'm sure you can, Father but I don't want to burden you with this problem. - No problem at all, a child with that kind of talent shouldn't be stuck in a factory for the rest of his life. - Well, God willing. - Please, God. - I understand you've learned to sing yourself. - Oh I do a little bit.

Thank you very much, thank you. Please you watch my stuff. - Listen Doc hey, it's nothing serious. He's gonna be all right, huh? - Why yes, yes he's going to be fine. He's a very shy quiet boy.

What do they call them, thera thera. - Psychotherapists? - Psychotherapists, yeah. And we'll see, hopefully everything will be all right. - Has Father Walsh seen the boy? - No, no he don't see nobody no more. He don't come downstairs no more. - Could I make a suggestion? - Sure, of course. - I think it would be good for Angelo if you could bring him back to the church to see Father Walsh. Forgive me, I'm not a psychologist but perhaps if Angelo could be brought back to the things he cared and liked. - We'd love to do that, Mr. Nicoli, but I mean Angelo he just doesn't want to go. - I don't know if you have heard. The good Father Walsh is seriously ill. I think it would be good for Angelo to visit him. I have here something which might help. It is for Angelo. I would like you to give it to him for me, and let him that I wish to see him again very soon. (somber orchestral music) - From Mario Lanza, Angelo. (somber orchestral music) Angelo, senior Nicoli told me something else. He told me that the good Padre, Father Walsh is very ill. And Mr. Nicoli said you should go visit him. All right, all right, Angelo? You'd go visit the Father Walsh, huh? Don't cry please. (somber orchestral music) (knocking on door) - Come in, it's open. Oh Angelo, Angelo. Oh Father in heaven, oh it's good to see you. I'd heard what happened and I was unable to come and see you. But here you are, thank God. I'm sorry I didn't get to speak to your father. Mr. Nicoli called and he said that he was there with you and your family. I understand you got a present from your favorite singer. I got a little present for you too. It's not much but it's meant a lot to me over the years. I never told you this, Angelo, but I was born the day after Christmas. When I was ordained my dear mother, God rest her soul, she gave me this little picture to remind me of not only my birth but of the birth of the Lord. Oh Angelo, Angelo, I did so want you to be here and sing again at Christmas. But I know that the dear Lord didn't intend for you to remain silent. I just wanted to be here when you sing again. But it's the Lord's will. You promise me you'll help Father Halloran at Christmas. Will you do that for me? And for the Lord? Will you do that?

May the Lord rest her soul. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Father, Angelo, he was with you this afternoon, wasn't he? - Yes, yes he was. As a matter of fact I sent him down to the basement to attend to the nativity set. That's when I got the call and had to leave. You don't suppose? - Suppose what, Father? - Oh my God, poor Angelo, they've probably left him all alone in the basement. Quick Frank, come with me. Oh my God, what a terrible thing. - [Frank] You think he's all right, Father? - I certainly hope so, Frank. Look at that, Frank, that is Christmas. That's what it's all about. (light orchestral music) (singing in foreign language) Winter was but four days old and night was rolling down the snowy hills. Suddenly a glistening star brighter than the moon, silvered all the world and lured the wide eyed shepherds down the singing hills to where a lowly manger stood, glowing in a wondrous light, and lying in the golden straw, a child. A child for whom the world waited, the child for whom the angels sang, the light of the world, the Prince of Peace, and every heart was filled with joy at his birth. The shepherds fell to their knees in adoration and joined their voices with the heavenly choirs. And Joseph, smiling over near proudly. And radiant Mary moist eyed, bent her head in thankfulness. (dramatic orchestral music) There was peace and love and joy in his birthing. And from that mystical moment, the world has never been the same. This is the essence of Christmas. This is what Christmas was, this is what Christmas is, and this is what Christmas will always be forever. (dramatic orchestral music) I would like to take this opportunity to wish all the parishioners a wonderful Christmas. May all the peace, love, joy, and heavenly blessings of this season be yours. May the Christ child smile upon you. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen. (organ music) (singing in foreign language) (bells tolling) (light orchestral music) (singing in foreign language) - Someday, the world will pay to hear you sing. (singing in foreign language) - [Angelo] Papa, I gotta sing. - [Frank] You see these hands? You see this is what puts bread on the table, good hard man's work. Not singing. - Papa, I can do it, I can be a good singer. I can do it Papa, I can be a good singer. - You will, you will, now you go out and play with your friends, we'll practice again tomorrow. God love him, he will sing as good as Lanza, or maybe even Caruso if I have to anything to do about it. If we have anything to do about it. (singing in foreign language) (light orchestral music)
