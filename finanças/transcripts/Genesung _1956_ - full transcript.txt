Recovery Starring: Directed by: Doctor! Doctor! Friedel. Departures To the chairman of the Reds, Comrade Mehlin. You must listen to him! You know him. He's coming on my advice. -Max. Can I sign a confession now, Mr. Mehlin? Please sign here, Dr. M?ller. Dr. M?ller is dead. In spite of everything, I'm happy we have met again, Friedel. What do you think, prosecutor? I'm not thinking about the case, Walter... But rather about you. You bear the responsibility for an entire district. What can my friend, comrade Ernst Mehlin, possibly have in common with this cheater? Three hours that determined my life. And his. As to the criminal code, the case is clear. One cannot measure such a fate based on paragraphs alone. As he approached me today, I recognized him immediately. Ten years ago, we encountered one another once. And the strange thing is, right here in Ahlsund. Nothing is in the past. It's the present, 1941. All clear. The fog will get thicker overnight. That's good. I'm going now, Comrade Schr?der. Heil... to you, honoured brothers and sisters. Teach me to love the byways. Because... I come to you as a Sunday's child. As Dr. Miracle Dream. Even for you, there's a little apple hanging... On the green tree of life. And if you don't reach all the way to it... Don't worry, my child. I'll deliver every wish... Day and night to your house. Since everyone has the right to dream. In Calcutta, Lappland, Thingamajig, and Berlin. 5000 RM Reward! Fugitive High Traitor! Ernst Mehlin I have to go now. -Then I'll come to your place. No! -Reni... We have known each other for three weeks. That long? -Very long, for this day and age. Everything okay, Max? Tomorrow night the fog will be even denser. Tomorrow, Comrade Kerster, I have to be in Sweden. How do our chances look today? 50-50. 24 hours later... For many comrades here it's an eternity too late. Got it. You sent Irene away. -She left on her own. Beach casino. Stop! Show us your papers! Your group works well. We have it easier. We smuggle. Stay to the left. Left! More to the left. Irene is still very young. She had a hard life without a mother. In '43, the Nazis killed her father. She will become a good comrade. Look out, the spotlight! Go to (unintelligible)! You see? Even the sailors are saluting you with their spotlights. Is it war? Not for us... today. All right, you scum! You'll search until you're black! It's a good night. They're shooting blind! How are our chances here, Captain? -You'll be across in the morning. A thousand to one for us. There are shots! -Fireworks. Dancing spotlights. Is it not to your liking? Oh, we'll turn it off. Moonlight, please. Walter! Your moonlight. It's your turn, man! -Spulke, my little director. Your pulse. Beware of a stroke. Shut your mouth, you aborted medical student! Wait for me, Reni. We have a lot of time before my midnight job. Hurry up and come! No, Friedel. Maybe tomorrow. This is not why I had you exempted! And cut out your subversive wisecracks. The slightest little thing, and you're off to the front. Understand? Spulke... Stroke. We'll get through. Quiet! When you speak, it bleeds more. -You're right. I'm here, Captain. Hello, Irene. For God's sake! -Unlock the door. A doctor? So, a doctor. Do you know one in the East? Not one that would help and not tell. Will we be able to go tonight? In three hours, the cutters will depart to fish the waters. We could make it through with them. Perhaps he can help. Your prodigal doctor? Your Wehrmacht helper? -But he studied medicine. Then is must have become too strenuous for him, the boardwalk singer. Nonsense. He would only have had to join the Students' League. Do you think that's easy for him? You can't march us there... And hardly fly us there either. So, somewhere a little apple, a dream, is ripening for you. He told me that. He didn't want to eat humble pie in front of the Nazis. That's why he gave up his studies. That's what you two say. -That's what I say. Whom of us knows him? -I do. How long have you known him? -Three weeks. Long enough for these times. He loves me. We're supposed to deliver him to some group of vagabonds? Why don't you give your assent? With me she thinks I'm jealous. Do you have a better suggestion, Max? -Comrade Schr?der... Hey! He will help her. It's between him and her. And me, of course. For God's sake! It's against the rules of the plot. When he comes, you have to decide... Whether the young man can help or not. We have to depart tonight. If I... on the way... Overboard, understand? Then continue across on your own. The comrades will have to take on my assignment. You'll have to tell them. All together now! Everyone has a right to desire. I am being summoned. You came after all. Great. -I have to speak to you. Yes, come. -Not here. Oh, come on! -No, no! A victory lap for the Sunday's child! How? -We'll leave in a minute. Now he's getting his medicine! You have to help me. -Your hands are so hot. Come to my place. Please! Someone's at my place. You have to help him. A friend. -A friend? He is being pursued. Don't forget to hurry back. Stop! Your draft card, please. What's this nonsense about? Do you know this guy? This bandage is much too loose. You were lucky. Are you a practitioner? Since when does a patient ask his doctor such questions? I'm sorry, Doctor, sir. It went straight through your lung. It's easy to treat, I know. You know, my father had a small nursery near Stuttgart. As a boy, I once fell from our apple tree. I guess you could say I was always seeking the fruits of knowledge. Now hold your breath. There was a pitchfork lying under the tree. A tine went right through my lung, but a good old country doctor fixed me right up. There, all done. Yes, well, then I fell into medicine. And now the pain will subside. But not in the area of the injury. In an hour it'll be fine. We'd need an airtight bandage, a tetanus serum, a syringe. Night pharmacy. I'll get it. Only with a doctor's certificate. In an emergency, one can find a bogus doctor at a bogus prescription counter. A bogus prescription? Irene, did a doctor ever prescribe you pills or drops, or something like that? Yes, but... -Quick, give it to me! An accident. -But I thought Dr. Kress was drafted. I don't know... I guess he's on vacation. -Please wait a minute. This here. And that she likes to dance. It fits her. Thanks. You shouldn't have one. She likes to dance? -You didn't know that? You are peculiar, not Irene. You come here and forge a prescription. You place yourself above the laws of the society in which we are forced to live. You too. -I'm at war. You're allowing yourself to drift. That's what you think... Mr. Mehlin. My name is Schr?der. -And my name is Dr. Kress, Mr. Schr?der. Earlier I was shown a photo of a high traitor. And? Well, just imagine if I had encountered this Mehlin fellow. I could've cashed in a 5,000-mark reward. No. But to criticize me with abstract theses, like you... also no. You're not thinking about your life. You're better off thinking about your own life. You're putting your neck on the line. For what? Among other things, for you. Thank you. Even though I didn't ask you to. You are a strange person. You don't live life because your head is stuck in philosophy. But life is much too nice for one to spend time over-thinking things. If I were a smuggler, would you have helped me? Probably. If Irene had asked me. And if I were a Nazi governor? Then you wouldn't have needed my help. Well? -But he has a performance, director. Cancel it! Cancel it! Walter, you're discharged... To the front, with the gypsy! I'll pick my apples. I find them in places where others don't see them. He who dreams of byways usually ends up on the military road. You impress me. And the Nazis, well, forget about it. But, if you were ever to govern... You know, I like my own government the most. You're an anarchist. -A very devoted one. However, I would rather be Doctor, M.D. Thank you. With a diploma in my pocket. There, this will bring you back to health. Until you are operated on. The worst is behind us. What does he look like? -Who? Oh, you mean the quack. Interesting young man. He has golden hands. Can one groom him? Won't work, huh? Too impulsive. Too unclear. He's seeking apples where none grows. -Apples? From the tree of knowledge. It was in the vernacular. Karl Oderich. You have the green light. She loves me, she loves me not. She loves me, she loves me not. Friedel! I have something for you. The factory is looking for painters. House painters? They'll take you, it's true. You can stay here. You want me to stay? -That way you remain exempted from the military. That's the most important thing. You said yes before I could ask. Me? -Yeah. You said we belong together. You said that. Is he away? That's good for him. And for me. Set the table. Very large dinner. You're arranging it, then? Half my paper has been cancelled, Reni. He has to accommodate me today. Raise the curtain! First the flowers, and then the secret. All freshly-cut flowers. Do you notice anything? No fragrant plants. After all, you don't need anything enchanting anymore. Where did you get all this stuff? -Well... An artist has his grateful public. And now, surprise number one. Eyes closed. -But I can wink. Then I'll close them again. -Then I'll try it on you. It's green. Look away, please. -But I can wink. I want a dress like a... forest meadow. "Take the faux silk", said the saleswoman. "Forest meadow is not available." Does it look good on me? -Can't you tell by my expression? You should tell me, though. Yes. And now, Irene, my modest one, my serious one, my dangerous one... Let us toast to this here. To the exceptional. This is exciting! -Patience. Ration Coupon 1941. For Two Spoons of Luck. Well... Konstanz? You counterfeiter. They are real. Early tomorrow we're departing. We're going straight across the countryside. When we get to Bodensee, we'll rent a boat, paddle around for a bit, and... accidentally we'll be on the other side. Real fairy tales. -Oh, let the war roll away to wherever it wants. No time for the world. Have you ever been to Bavaria? Oh, and in Switzerland the mountains are even higher. And there are glaciers... As green as your dress. Glaciers are white. -You're going to experience it. You shall be happy. But I am happy. But look at your life! A cage! And one of these days it will go awry. Only when one breaks open the cage... Does one get out. The day after tomorrow we will be out. Dad said we had to break open the cage. Tomorrow morning I'm going back to the factory, and you are as well, Friedel. Oh man, Friedel Walter as a house painter! At our place, you won't get a draft notice either. But you should get away from here, away from the danger! In your dreams there are no obligations. The world is different. Here. I know you will come with me. Say no more. Believe in it... At least until tomorrow. -Until tomorrow. Departures. V?lkischer Beobachter! Der Angriff! Der St?rmer! Orderly to the officers' compartment. Window seats. Nice view! -Wake up. It's daytime! Reni! -Stay here, please. I love you, Friedel, but I can't leave. You know why. You belong to me, but I don't belong to your group. Dream? Serious? -No. Reni! To the Air-Raid Shelter. Druggist? -Yes. Pharmaceutical apprentice. Your career goal, man! -Doctor. But I can also sing. KV! KV! KV! Medic! Medic! My leg, doctor. -He's sewing you up. Arterial forceps. Did you get any mail, Dr. M?ller? -From Dresden... Mail. You have to take cover! Why bother? Swab. The ordnance is striking! Get out! Needle. Take cover! Medic? Medic! Be quiet. I will continue. Later. Uh, my field blouse is outside. Hey, that's no good without your identification book. There we are! Dr. M?ller. Where is your home? -It says in there. Dresden. Hey, medic, Dr. M?ller is dead. You will be fired as a doctor. All the best, Dr. M?ller. And you cannot march there... And also not from there... Because of hernias, they haven't released anyone for a whole two years. And me, of all people? What if the medical record exaggerates a little? You're great, doctor! And you can play like god himself. When I'm home with my old lady in eight days, I won't need that thing anymore anyway. Thank you. Tell me about your job? How did you get the idea to become a doctor? The guy who forged my doctor diploma perfectly looked a lot like you. Hey, please post this letter for me when you get home. At your command, Dr. M?ller. Without a return address? -She knows whom it's from. Irene. Your wife? I shouldn't have gone away. I thought I'd be able to forget her. Always serious. No wonder, considering what she was. A Communist. But when she smiles... Irene Schorn? Doesn't live here. Irene Schorn? No. Motor Works? Now we are a shipyard. We build ships. Try the record section. ...Schneider, Schneider, Schnook, Schultz, Schumander... Irene Schorn isn't registered here. She lived here. The war resided here, young man. I would try the registry of deaths... She's alive. Moved away? Got married? No. -The files... I will look for her myself. -Residence permit. Space is limited. Show me your identification. I only have this here... Aha, returnee. Why didn't you say that right away, doctor, sir? That's a mistake I have to deal with. -Relatives in Dresden. Uh, no. But... -Doctors are needed here, sir. Please wait. -That's out of the question. The chief physician of Ziethen Hospital often has his people call here. I wanted the address of Irene Schorn. Professor Beheim, please. -Oh, listen... Professor? I have here a young colleague of yours. Dr. M?ller. That's right. I don't want to get a job through mediation. Yessir, Professor. You are supposed to introduce yourself. Help him out, and in the meantime you can look for your Irene. You're crazy. Good evening, professor. What are you? -Sorry? Surgeon, chemist? I have only ever worked in a military hospital. Ah. Do you know anything? -Not much. Are you always this honest? -Whenever possible. Report cards? Burned. Well, OK. Have the head nurse show you your room. Rounds are tomorrow morning at eight. Be punctual! A doctor with a guitar! In the military hospital, we did almost strictly surgical work.. Make sure the ward physician gets his coffee on time. Don't give me a blank stare. We are to read him the patient histories in time. He's singing again! I had to give him morphine again this morning. He's driving me nuts. Now you know the patients. Except for room 8. Our most difficult nursing case. He has been here five years. An old resistance fighter. The municipal government pays for him. Even the SED. He was injured in the last days of the war. A bombing attack. Here. On the edge of the 11th thoracic vertebrae. Shrapnel? A tough person. Won't die. And his family... Well! Paralyzed. From his navel down. Permanently? The only thing we can do for him... That he never catches wind of that. I'm entrusting you with that especially. Hello, Max. Happy, but loud. Everything's A-OK, chief. Seaman's weather. Medicine for the nerves. This is Dr. M?ller, my colleague. A specialist for cases like yours. Hello. Another doctor in the cabin. Curious? -Always have been. Thanks. To a doctor, curiosity is the crow's nest, sailor. Well, Max, how are things with your big toe today? Take a look, professor, it's moving. Just a little bit. There! Splendid! Let's continue on this path, with patience. And if you need anything, your Dr. M?ller is always available for you. You saw it, professor! It moved! -It was just like yesterday. Oh, well. But it can't be. -It can. Our art has its limits. Yes? At the explicit request of the head nurse. Thank you. Why don't you join me, sister? -I'm on duty, sir. And the cake... also from the head nurse. She's awfully young. She looks very nice. Do I know her? She looks so familiar to me. -But the photo is from 1941. Then I must be mistaken. So many people resemble each other. Our station. I'm sure it's room 8 again. Why didn't you come sooner? I'm in pain! Damn it, you're squishing my foot! -I'm not sitting on your leg. Am I the one in pain, or are you? I want morphine! You have already gotten your shot for tonight. You're cheating me. You're diluting it with water. Stay calm, Kerster. During storms, pain is a good sign. If I can't sleep... or move my toe, as usual... Oh, it's moving. Finally. After five years. After 5 times 365 massages. I understand. Now I'm living off my comrades, like driftwood, like rotted wood. Now that what we wanted has been realized. I know, Max. -Now I have to be fed like a parasite! Look, the toe! I see. -You saw it? Of course. Nerves grow back. You just have to have patience and... No! Max, I wouldn't go on believing that it will heal. You must come to terms with the fact that your spine has been destroyed. Stop! -That your body, from the navel on down, no longer exists. Stop! You people are supposed to help. -Only the truth can help! You're supposed to be a doctor?! You don't even believe it yourself, and that's the worst part. Your toe is not moving. -Yes, it is! Never, but the world is moving. You... You have a heart that's beating, you have a head... One cannot walk with one's head. -But one can think! I want to see the professor. I am not a Communist like you. One time I got to know two of them. They said that one must think... About life, about... about everything. To use one's intellect. They called it consciousness. So why don't you use it, your intellect, your consciousness! Man, you are alive. Make something of it! Start anew. Doctor? Leave us alone. Professor Beheim has more experience... perhaps. Do nerves grow back, or not? Fear of one's own courage... You doctor, you egghead! Whom can your truth help? -Well, if one had money... Then one could learn. -Money... I wanted to build automobile motors. Should I maybe go to school in this bed? But one could... Oh, I see. You can't sit. All my bones can be broken... If it helps. We... How can we... make your hip mobile? Yes! Hey, we'll build you a self-propelling chair! Are you serious? -Almost everything depends on you. Yes, but... you need care-giving. Are you married? The cutter! Oh, I have a wife. Maybe this plan will work. -I have to start reading books. That's another thing I have to learn from scratch again. Your morphine. Your medicine is better. Sleep well, Max. Let's start with Kerster today. One second, professor. May I tell you something first? In the doctors' room. As you wish. A good nurse is not nosy. Nonsense! -I will have to... This Tantrism! Get out! What a load of rubbish! You're ruining what I've fostered for years, so the poor man could live. Say it to his face! This way he'll lie like this for another 15 years. Yes, but he knows the lies are lies. That he'll never improve, so he clings to the morphine. And now he'll demand of you that he'll be able to sit in 6 months and go outside. And admitted to school. To school! Like a daydreamer! Look, do you think he can concentrate on the simplest mathematical formula? People can do more than you give them credit for, Professor. I believe. Believe! You're a charlatan if you believe. But no doctor. That means... I have to go. Really? And your patient, young man? No, you're staying, or I'll have your medical degree revoked. Kerster. He is now your obligation. Then... take care of him pursuant to your methods. Medicine doesn't have any methods. Just assistance. So, you want to try out a different type of... lying? Well, fine, my friend. But find his confederates. His next-of-kin. Tell them everything you have caused, mercilessly. This isn't about you... But about him. Good morning. Patient Card: Max Kerster Can I help you? -Please excuse the late hour. I... It's you. -Yes, Irene. Reni! I looked for you everywhere. I survived the war. I came here to look for you, but my Irene no longer exists. But now I have you in my arms. -My dear, listen. We have been apart for years. Nonsense! Everything happened yesterday. -You're dreaming, you fool. I know, I shouldn't have gone away. You did go away. Are you crying? I have to tell you something. -I can imagine you have a new name. Is that so important now? I come home to find you. Nothing. I doctor around a bit. Today I went to look for a patient's wife. In the dark, I press the wrong buzzer, and find you. Well, am I not a Sunday's Child? You're a doctor now? My name is Irene Kerster. Back then, we couldn't let you meet Max. He was our leader. And he loved me. He became my brother, my comrade, the party. He taught me how to live, to fight. He became my husband. Max was wise and strong, and we were lucky. Until that night. I saw him like this for the last time. And ever since... You love your husband. To watch him lie there... unable to do anything. You understand why I had to tell him the truth. And you also understand how unusual this responsibility is to me. Max is strong. I shouldn't have surprised you like this. I'm happy... that you became a doctor after all. In the war I had to do all kinds of studying. Maybe it's best if you don't tell Max that we know each other, for now. I have always been a bit foolish. Friedel, the jester, was with Irene. The doctor, with Mrs. Kerster. Departures Arriving on track 7, the holiday train B124 from Dresden. But whereto? Anywhere. -But you must know where you want to go! Unbelievable! Where is the next train going? 22:10, international train, Copenhagen-Basel. I'll take a ticket for that one. Cheers. Another one. Are you thirsty? -No. Then you're drinking without thirst. So you're a sailor? No. Me either. What are you doing here anyway? I'm going away. Going away is good. I was a sailor once, too. I was always going away. Now I'm going away from here, from the train station with my schnapps. Another one, please. Why are you going away? My girl has someone else. Well, then find yourself someone else, too. Or take her away from him. If you're not a sailor, then what are you? I always went away. Boy, oh boy. Then why don't you stay here for a change? What will become of your ship, sailor? You would like that, wouldn't you? You're staying here, understand? Passengers for the train to Basel via Gr?nstadt, please board and close the doors. For the train to Basel via Gr?nstadt, please board and close the doors. Are you not at all curious what will happen here if you go away? You're drunk. You're missing your train... Sailor. Good day, Sister Hilde. -Good day. But visiting hours haven't started, Mrs. Kerster. I'd like to speak with the new doctor. -Dr. M?ller? -No, Walter. We don't speak to our chief physician using his first name. For Kerster I need neurology and psychology. Dr. M?ller, you have a visitor. An old acquaintance of yours. It was not easy to find you. Uh, please retrieve the books for me first. Should I put the flowers into water for you, doctor? The flowers are for my husband. How naive I was at the time. Of course, Walter was your pseudonym. Only pseudonym. Yes. I have to tell him, Friedel... That we know each other. -No, Irene. Not yet. That would hurt him. Your flowers. So you don't forget me. How is your work going? -The kindergarten? You know how much I like the work. The new doctor... I have to tell you something. You know him? The school is establishing your curriculum. The comrades want a new downstairs apartment. Charity for Max Kerster! I didn't mean it like that, dear. I'm scared. I can't retain anything. Have patience. I can't always be alone... Without you. The roses are pretty. Do you know the surgery agenda for tomorrow? Kerster. Double-hip operation. Professor... Will his heart... Am I supposed to not operate?! I have been observing him now for four weeks. Essentially, it seemed to me nothing new happened. Psychological things. And before that, he was in control. With unbelievable toughness, this man gathered his strengths. Forces us to operate. Can you take responsibility for this operation? The patient has transformed entirely. He has reduced his morphine to one-third of what it was. After five years habituation. He's reading. He has had setbacks, but he's beginning to... -Hope! Speculation. Do you know why I'm operating tomorrow? If I don't operate, he will notice that we have deceived him again, and he will give up on himself. -But, if... -You're assisting! I'm scared. -You're having doubts. Because you are young. Don't wean yourself off these doubts, but sometimes one has to overcome them. One gets used to it in our profession. Why don't you take a look into the microscope. Do you recognize that specimen? Skin tissue. Transplantation of foreign tissue on the human organism. Attempt number 3,411. I have been working on that for fifteen years. And in five years I might know if this path will yield more results. I envy you. -I doubt until I'm certain. This is Professor Beheim's. Friedel, I would have liked to see you. Can we talk? Friedel. Friedel! A courageous woman. Who? -The woman I loved. That was a long time ago. She was engaged to one of my patients. At the time, I thought there was no one else for me. And no stronger passion. It takes a long time to get to know you, Professor. Psychologist. Actually, I envy you. How you play on the affections of people. Your passion is practical. Mine is more theoretical. But... the curiosity. The sort of... creative curiosity. We both have that. The stronger passion. Suspend the anesthesia. Pulse. Oxygen! His heart made it through. Thank you, Friedel. We had to give him morphine again. Well, little one? I can sit. I knew you would make it. The dress... is new. For you! I must be tired. I... You're sleeping too little, Dr. M?ller. Oh, well. When Kerster is out of the woods... But he has a fever again. Vitamin A shots. More confidence, man with guitar. Werf Kindergarten Class? Good evening, Max. Why are you not talking, Max? Are you in pain? The weather. Rain should not unsettle a sailor, huh? Go! Kerster! Let go. -Give it to me. Open your hand. They belong to me. Just two more ampoules! Give them to me! -So that's how it is. Morphine. You want to shrink away. To tear out. Now that you're so close to the goal, you give up. Think of Irene. Soon your self-propelling chair will be here. Then you can go to the park with your wife. Max, relearn how it is outside. With Irene... Go to park. Kindergarten. And to watch her as she plays with the little buggers. And with each little one, imagine how it would look if it were her child. You clairvoyant! And to learn thereby. I can't stand your talking anymore, your sympathy! Give me my morphine! I'll hang onto them for you, Max. If you still want them in one month... I'll give you five ampoules. Let us make this covenant. I'm taking you on your word, doctor. Well, Max, I... I, too have downbeat days sometimes. Sometimes. And there's a good medicine for that. Curtain open! If only you knew how much this little piece of wood has given me solace. The rain is whooshing. It makes us grouchy. What does one do? One fantasizes. Did you study that as well? I come to you, Max, as a Sunday's child. As Dr. Miracledream. Even for you there's a little apple hanging, Max, on the green life-tree. And if you can't quite reach it... Don't be too upset, old boy. That song! I'll deliver to you your every wish. What would you like the most? Where did you learn it? Because dreaming... -The song, man! My wife used to sing that all the time. A vagabond... A miracle doctor... Yes, a miracle doctor taught it to her! A well-known pop song. I used to like it. Too bad, I can't seem to cheer you up with the guitar either. No. When one is sick for a long time, Max, one becomes vulnerable, and one applies everything to oneself. That will pass once you are able to go home again. All right. She loves you. How do you know? Well, she proves it to you everyday. -Oh, be quiet. Max, you will eventually go home to her. You will... work, always get healthier. You two will be happy together. Stop it. Hey! Your piano. It was nice of you, Friedel. Good night. Well, has something happened? A nervous breakdown? Encephalitis? -He's sleeping. What? -Let's wake him. We'll do the rounds without him. I wonder if Kerster has turned the corner already. I was never this scared before an exam. We were more scared than you, Comrade Kerster. Scared, gentlemen? What did you expect? Congratulations to you as well, Doctor. You were also tested, so to speak. Thank you. Goodbye. Um, the semester begins in 14 days. Well, can you believe it? Max... Shall we try out my new wheelchair? This way or that way? Whichever way you want. Wow, man, I'm moving! I can go wherever I want. The sea heaves freely, comrades. And a storm from far out over the sea comes over land. And we sailors, you know, understand the wind and freedom firsthand. Your patient can go home in two days. Dr. M?ller, you're not saying anything. Then I guess I have to... inform Mrs. Kerster now. Have you been waiting long, Friedel? Max wanted to surprise you. -I've known for a while. You have it nice here. We won't be seeing each other very much anymore. I mean, it's not necessary anymore. I guess I'll be going away again soon. They're coming from stacking. They're going dancing. This has changed a lot. But one always recognizes it again. But today we are very adult. Both of us. Max is a whole person again. The patient gave the doctor a lesson. What's wrong? Max is strong. I'm happy for him. And for you. I'll go hide. Daydreaming is not allowed! Go. Quick, run. Reni. Reni! I'll just go take a peek, like in the train station when the train leaves. Do you remember? "Let's go away", you said. Here are the tickets. Friedel... the world is beautiful. Life is glorious. Yes, that's what I said at the time. If you had two tickets now, Friedel! You wouldn't accept them. Max loves you. He needs you. You would never do that... But if you went away with me... how would we live? I would never become a real doctor if I betrayed him. Him or you. My plans don't work out. It's easy when one uses two names, Friedel. Then the one is wrong... but present. Irene, I have to tell you something. -Don't say anything. And what I said... forget it. Irene. So, he's coming tomorrow? Good, Friedel. Finally, Doctor. Where were you? The professor is expecting you. My dear young friend. I'm an old man, an experienced doctor. But... You have proven to me that our medicinal art has a healing power that can't be appraised highly enough. The belief in the patients' will to live. Your audacity, almost too reckless, led you to success. The medical history of Max Kerster. I wrote it down. It will be published, under your name, of course... Dr. M?ller. My congratulations. From our station. -I'm very happy for you. Professor... You embarrass me. Max Kerster, my friend, can thank himself for his recovery. Indiscriminately and carelessly, I threw him into the water. That he didn't drown... His extraordinary strength of character... Pfft, false modesty, my dear chap. You're the one who recognized the strength in Kerster. Your medical vision. It's nothing, if you hadn't helped. Please excuse me. I can't! Mr. Prof. Beheim Max, listen... -Why so formal? I have to leave. I am not a doctor. Slow down, Friedel. Come again. -No, I... I'm not a doctor. And Max, the flibbertigibbet, the miracle doctor with Irene back then, you know? That was me. But she loves you! Look, I... didn't know... That you... -Not so fast! You lied to me. So you're the one. But you did help me. And now you take off? How did that go again? One cannot run away. That's what Dr. M?ller told me. Was that also a lie? Forget about what was! Dr. M?ller told me that, too. And start afresh. -I'm not a patient. A disease questionnaire can't be made healthy by fraud, either. And now I will write out a certificate for you. Tell him everything. You know him. Doctor! Doctor! That's how he came to me. And what is your judgment, comrade state prosecutor? He defied our laws. Malpractice and falsification. He is guilty of fraud. But, that's only the one side. In actual fact, Friedel Walter, the phony doctor, is not on trial. In actual fact, the past is on trial, which didn't allow this person, trained in medicine, to become a doctor. Our court, a court of the power of workers and farmers, does not only exist to punish. It exists to free from his guilty past he who has become guilty, if he proves his worth through his work, his decisions, and his responsibilities. That he has atoned for past acts that were dangerous to society, the defendant has long since proven by his subsequent behaviour. Before the court retires for its deliberations, I shall repeat the question posed by the witness, Mehlin: Defendant, What will you do with your life after you have served your sentence? Answer, Friedel! Will you return once again to the lecture hall to study medicine? If our people, if our state, gives you the opportunity? Yes. Pursuant to the request of the state prosecutor, the court acquits the defendant. He'll be here soon. -He'll be happy to see us. He'll meet you alone. We have to get divorced. Max? -I need clarity and strength. Your loving sympathy. Don't go. Max! We'll talk about it later. I'm tired. I'm going home. Bring him with you. -You'll wait for us, won't you? You're not unhappy, Friedel, right? I have a lot of plans. That's new for me. Without you... and without Max it would be nothing. You're happy. I am curious. Don't be too long. The train's leaving soon. Train? Or... are you going a little later? What do you mean, "going"? But you're moving to Rostock. -Rostock? He didn't tell you? But he gave his notice to ABF. -No! He wants to leave. On track 10, the train to Rostock is boarding. Doors closing. I'll go on ahead, Friedel! Profession: sailor. If your lady doesn't miss the train... There are many trains... If one knows where one wants to go, one never arrives too late. Subtitles by BobbyFletcher/ Oliver L. for KG
