He ended up having to redesign the whole layout. He did? It may have turned out better than the original plans. Oh. You remember where the rise in the main house is? Vaguely. Well, let's say that, uh, right here is the rise and the main house. -Oh. -And, uh... on down the road, there's the stables on the right. I can't imagine a better location for them.

Isn't that the woman you used to work for back at the newspaper in what's his face? Kingman's Ferry. She was more than just someone I used to work for, Max. She was my teacher, my mentor. I learned more from Biddy in one year than I learned from six years in college. You've met Eleanor, Max, don't you remember? When Jennifer's book was first published at the signing? Oh, yeah, that good looking, feisty broad at the front of the line -who demanded a free copy. -[LAUGHS] JENNIFER: I remember that. She said she shouldn't have to pay because she invented me. I tried to get her telephone number, couldn't score. I can't believe she's gone. Every time I sit down to write, I feel Biddy looking over my shoulder, pushing me, cajoling me, encouraging me. Well, that won't change. She'll always be there for that. I just wish I had a chance to look her in the eye one more time. Maybe a chance to say goodbye is the next best thing?

Oh, do you know what this is? JONATHAN: Klayman's Bridge. How did you know that? Says so right there, "Klayman's Bridge 1892". Oh. This used to be the main route into the town, I wonder why they haven't kept it up. Well, after a hundred years I guess it turned into the main route leading down in the river. Wood gets old, cars are heavier than horse drawn wagons. But this bridge used to be a legend. Isn't there a lot of legends in this part of the world? Oh, but this was a romantic legend. [CHUCKLES] The man who built this bridge was someone called Jeffrey Klayman and the morning he finished it, the sun was coming up over those hills. One of the girls in town snuck out of the house at sunrise, ran right over here and kissed him in the middle of the bridge, to congratulate him. I guess they didn't know about rock stars then, huh? -Do you wanna hear this? -Oh, yeah, sure. -Are you sure? -Yes. All right, anyway, supposedly the couple was inseparable. Eventually they married and they lived together for 70 years, and they even died together, in the same bed on the same day. They were supposedly as much in love as the day they were married. That must have been a hell of a kiss. Heh, well, that's the legend. If two lovers kiss in the middle of Klayman's Bridge at sunrise, their love will last forever. Hmm. JONATHAN: Does the legend say anything about two people standing at the entrance of Klayman's Bridge with the sunlight still shining on them during the day? I don't think so. -I don't think we should risk it. -Huh? [LAUGHS] Think it'll work?

Something's not right. -Has it changed that much? -Yeah. This place was full of life once, it was bustling. Oh, maybe it's just because Biddy's gone. She was Kingman's Ferry to me. JACK: Though Eleanor is no longer with us, the dream she had remains as alive today as ever. That dream is Kingman's Ferry, the town, it's people, it's future. But Eleanor only planted the seeds. If we are ever to see her dream in full bloom, it is up to us, people who live, work and raise families here, to nurture and feed what Eleanor started. A rich harvest follows a season of hard work, and what we reap of Eleanor's dream will be more than a well worth effort.

Well, I am glad to meet the both of you at long last. What do you mean at long last? Well, this is a small town, Mrs. Hart, word gets around quickly. Word of what? I think I can explain a little better down at my office. [BIRDS SQUAWKING] Oh, so you were Eleanor's attorney. Oh, I'm everyone's attorney, Mrs. Hart. This is what you classify as a one horse town. There is not much room for competition. I'll be right back. I take it from your reaction to the crowd out there, you weren't aware of Eleanor's status in Kingman's Ferry? JENNIFER: Her status? I was aware that she was a respected citizen and that she owned the newspaper. Oh, you weren't aware that Eleanor Biddlecomb owned Kingman's Ferry? She owned the town? I didn't know that. Oh, yes, Mrs. Hart, from sea to shining sea, every last piece of it. Come on in. You see Kingman's Ferry was never incorporated by the state. Sit down. The Army requisitioned the land and, uh, that was from Eleanor's great, great, great and so forth grandfather. They built a fort on it and won a war. Eventually, uh, somebody reminded the Army of the Biddlecomb and, uh, they returned the property. Yeah, by that time, of course, a small community had grown up around the fort, though the fort was no longer in existence but the property always remained in private hands. So Eleanor was responsible for everything that happened around here? Oh, yes, and no. I mean we have general elections just like everyone else. Yeah, we have a mayor, we also have a chief of police but, yes, when you come to the bottom line, if everything else failed, people went to Eleanor to bail them out. I think I feel an and coming on here. And here it comes. So about a year ago, Eleanor asked me to draw up a new will. She was getting along in years, she had no children, none of the family were left. Her main concern was the future of this town. She wanted to hand it over to somebody who was capable and fit and honest. And? And that is why, as of last Friday, Mrs. Hart, you became the new owner of Kingman's Ferry. ♪♪♪ Me? Things really have changed so much. Not for the better I'm afraid. Fishing was the life's blood of this place, sometimes I'd come down here in the morning and watch the fishermen's work with their nets. There were tons of boats, it was really, really busy. Unfortunately except for Captain Jack and a couple of hangers on, the fishing business is practically non-existent here. Really? Eleanor wanted to bring it all back, a complete restoration of the entire downtown area, -the museum, the cannery, the docks. -[SCOFFS] The town square looks brand new. Oh, that was Captain Jack's doing. The square, the park, the restoration of the original gas lamps, that was his gift to the town. Very generous. So when Eleanor died, she not only left me the town and all the people, she left me her hopes and dreams along with it. That about sums it up. [CHUCKLES] Ought to be a cinch. I don't know how owning a town works, Jeremy, did Eleanor collect taxes, rent? Oh, Eleanor couldn't legally and didn't collect taxes, but you see she was sort of chief cook and bottle washer around here, so if people could afford to pay their rent, they usually paid it to her. I take it that's a past tense? You take it right, sir. Eleanor's heart was somewhat larger than her pocket book. Uh, Mrs. Hart, there is one other thing I should tell you. You see there is a codicil in the will, -you do not have to accept Kingman's Ferry. -I don't? Well, if I don't, what happens to the town? It will probably revert to the county, and seeing the county is broke, they'll probably kick it back to the state. And then? Most likely the state will reapportion the lands, you know, divide it up between the different townships and Kingman's Ferry will quietly fade into the sunset. ♪♪♪ [JENNIFER SIGHS] What do you think, darling? -I think it's your decision. -Oh. I knew that's what you'd think. Did you say there was a mayor in town? Oh, yes. Well, maybe we should go see him. I've a thousand and one questions.

CHIEF: Even if I follow your theory, Mr. Hart, what you're saying is that we've got a string of murders and vandalism here in Kingman's Ferry and it took your presence to uncover it. [SCOFFS] It's more than theory, chief. What I do know is Eleanor was working very hard to get this town back on its feet. She died and turned that job over to my wife. Suddenly someone doesn't want us here and the only person willing to help just rode out of here in a plastic bag. I just don't think we're dealing with coincidence here. I'll make a note of that, Mr. Hart. File it under H. -[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] -Ooh. Oh, sorry. Take my advice, folks, leave the police work to the police, it's healthier for everyone involved. Excuse me. Diving gear? Is that standard department issue? Strictly personal. In the Navy I did it for a living, it's recreational, you dive? Yeah, little bit. The Red Sea. Well, take my word for it if you haven't seen the local shelf, you've missed something. It's not the Red Sea, but it's worth seeing. I'll see you later. Can I fire him? I don't think so. -He's elected. -Oh, too bad. I'm beginning to think that my story goes well past the human interest angle. You might check out the hall of records. You might find that someone wants to see this place stay the way that it is, tax reports, city records, whatever you can come up with. Darling, a town this small doesn't have a hall of records. Well, an alcove of records then. They've got to keep that stuff someplace. [GASPS] Town hall. JEREMY: Mr. and Mrs. Hart. Jeremy, what are you doing here this late. I just had something to give you, I've been knocking on your door. Oh, this is a terrible business about Mayor Trout. Terrible business, that seems to be the party line around here. Well, anyway, I left something by your phone. I asked the desk clerk to let me in. I told him you wouldn't mind. Why didn't you just leave it downstairs? Well, it's something very personal. Fewer hands, less people to blame when something goes wrong. See, I was going through some of Eleanor's things and I found she'd left something for you. So I thought you should have it as soon as possible. Oh, thank you very much. -Oh, good night. -Good night. I wonder what this is all about. By the phone, by the phone. It's a letter. Is this the present that Claire gave you? -Oh, it's broken. -Yeah. It must have slipped off the edge of the table. Oh, what a shame. What's in the letter? Oh... Uh... It's from Eleanor. "Dear Jennifer, by now you either resent me terribly for the position that I've put you in, or you've already been back to the office, blown the dust from your old desk, rolled up your sleeves and are now well into the job at hand. If you're as obstinate as I believe you to be, and hopefully encouraged, you're up to your pretty ankles by now. Dreams don't come easily. We both know that. Between you and me, you're the only one who could see this thing through. Truth and courage. Eleanor." [SIGHS] WAITRESS: Sunny side? -Me. WAITRESS: That makes you the over easy with hash. This is your idea of local color? Oh, come on, it's great. I think my local color is gonna end up on the green side. Darling, when in Rome. When in Rome, I usually eat at the GG Fodsi. Ah, but at GG... [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [LAUGHS] Mangia. [SCOFFS] What do you think? Don't tell my arteries, it's terrific. [LAUGHS] I told you so. MAX: Dasvidania. ♪♪♪ Bilgewater Bill. Hey, Mrs. H.

I'll have a hearty breakfast too. Bring hearty breakfast. Maybe it would be a good idea if you went to the Queen's English. Long live the Queen. WAITRESS: Anything else? Yeah, I'll have what my comrades are having too. They're having the check, matey, you want one too? And your telephone number. Yeah, it seems pretty fishy to me. And I don't mean in a seafaring way, Mrs. H. Yeah, it doesn't hold water on our end either, Max. I was supposed to meet Mayor Trout at the museum. A man called Charlie Loomis saw him go in, but never saw him go out. So how did he end up drowned in the bay half a mile away? That's a good question, Mr. H. How? I don't know, Max, I was hoping you could put together some of the pieces around here. MAX: Good, what you want me to do? I thought you could talk to some of the locals and, uh, Max, go easy on the Russian lingo, will you? Oh, gee. Maybe they'll open up to you, tell you something they haven't told us. Just charm them and gain their confidence then? JONATHAN: Yeah, something like that. I think we'll start with Charlie Loomis, he's the man I was telling you about. JENNIFER: Jonathan. Charlie? Darling, we have to start somewhere and Charlie does a lot of skulking around. At least if he doesn't know anything, he sees everything that's going on. Charlie acts like he's the town crazy, but there's a lot more going on there than meets the eye, I think. Do you want me to call you at your hotel? No, Max, we'll keep in touch with you, I'm gonna go down to the docks, poke around and see if anybody saw anything going on around there last night. Jennifer's gonna go over to City Hall and go over the town records. We'll keep in touch with you. [SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] Uh, Max?

We, uh, didn't realize who it was at first. Sorry, Mr. Hart, we've been having a lot of problems with theft here lately. Brock? Sorry, Mr. Hart. You to go finish up in the Susan, I'll take care of Mr. Hart. Sorry about that. The boys there are a little overzealous sometimes. Been kind of rough on them the last few years, business is bad, they lost their mom three-three years ago. I guess they tend to be pretty protective over what they got left. [CHUCKLES] I apologize for the bad manners. Apologies accepted. Now, Claire, are you sure you won't come with us? I can't give you a ride. -No, no, no, I left Abi back in the office. -All right. -I'll see you later. -See you later. Bye. [CAR HORN HONKS] What did you find out? What would you say if I told you that the electrical bill for the museum was nearly $4000 a month. I say that they ought to check out that lightbulb. [CHUCKLES] And that's not all. I decided it would be a good idea to check the gas bill with all those new lamps in town. And? There was no gas bill. There's no gas bill? No, so what's lighting the lamps? Gas. But where are they getting it? Let's take a drive over to waterfront. Check with gas and electric. Maybe they can clear things up. Good idea. ♪♪♪ Jonathan. -You got that belt on tight? -Yes. I can't stop. [TIRES SQUEALING] ♪♪♪ [SIGHS] You okay? No. ♪♪♪ JENNIFER [ON PHONE]: Unfortunately we never got to waterfront, Max. Jonathan did some following up on the telephone. I'm telling you, Mrs. H, Mr. H may be onto something. This Charlie guy goes around snooping a little too much for a crazy guy. JENNIFER: I find it so hard to believe. Charlie's always been so harmless. Well, you know what they say about these quiet, harmless types, Mrs. H. Jonathan wants you to stick by Charlie, unless you come to a dead end, and then you could go down to the waterfront, and find out if anybody saw anything last night. Got you, Mrs. H. What's Mr. H up to? Uh, I don't know, he's staring. Bye, Max. Shaking and quaking, and prancing and dancing. [BARKING] MAN 3: Shut up, Tiger. Well, the transmission's all shot to hell. I don't know she's even worth fixing. Well, we'll let the rental company make that decision. That's probably best. Tiger, shut up. Do you do a lot of salvage? No one else around to do it, parts mostly, decent money in it. Saves time when my customer's in a hurry. You wouldn't by any chance have Eleanor Biddlecomb's car here, would you? 74 Plymouth, round the back. Mind if we take a look? Well, it ain't worth much. Take a look though if it makes you happy. -Thanks. -Thanks. JONATHAN: Easy, Tiger. [BARKING] Shut up, Tiger! Darling, what are you looking for? Well, maybe what happened to our car wasn't just bad luck. Someone may have figured that if it worked on Eleanor's, it may have worked on ours. Did you find anything? Uh... -Yep. There it is. -What? Clean and clear. The brake lines, they've been cut right through. [BARKING] I think he likes candy. Here, boy. [SIGHS] ♪♪♪ JEREMY: This is very disturbing news, Mr. Hart. If what you're saying is true... Well, there are no ifs, Jeremy, Eleanor Biddlecomb was murdered. Jeremy, why wasn't there an investigation? Why did everybody just assume it was an accident? In Kingman's Ferry, heh, who would be expecting such a thing? Well, maybe that's exactly what the murderer was counting on. Mr. Hart, if you know something concerning Eleanor's death, I really should know about it. Well, when I do, you will, Jeremy. Come on, darling. ♪♪♪ Chief Carson? Great, what do you think, Junior?

You better see for yourself. Oh, my God, Max, what is this? CHARLIE: Tunnels, Miss Edwards. Rum-running tunnels, only I don't think it's rum they're running through this, baby. Heya, hoya! You guys aren't the only ones that think that something's up here. Charlie said there's been funny things been going on for the last eight or nine months. What have you got, Charlie? I haven't put it all together yet, sir. It took me all this time to get this far, but you can take it to the bank and made it home. It's got something to do with these tunnels. Have you followed them back inside? Tried, tried, too many channels going into many directions. Besides, I had a little interruption when Maxy here showed up. Maxy? For a moment, I thought he was playing for the other team. Strike three, you're out. In-in a minute, I'm sure this is all gonna become extremely clear, but what are you talking about, Charlie? Don't know as I know enough to fill you in the, Miss Edwards. I'm conducting a sort of an official investigation into Mrs. Biddlecomb's murder. You knew that Eleanor was murdered? Had a hunch, followed it. [MUMBLING] This is where it got me. Charlie was a Fed, Mrs. H. FBI? CHARLIE: 1943 to 1968, seen a lot of things go down in my time. I bet you have, Charlie, I bet you have. JENNIFER: Look at this. That's a commendation from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Good man, FDR, maybe one of the last of the great ones. Hail to the Chief. Charlie, this is wonderful. I don't understand. Why I hang out in the park, acting like a crazy man? Yes. CHARLIE: I am a crazy man, Miss Edwards. I seen more than I'd care to remember about things I'd like to forget. Getting a little old for it though. What do you know about those tunnels, Charlie? It's funny. I completely forgot about them tunnels being there. [WHOOSHES] Out of sight, out of mind. Then one night, I saw Ele... Uh, Mrs. Biddlecomb, she was poking around down by the museum. I followed her down to the water and that's when I remembered it. Hoya. How did you know about those tunnels in the first place? Guy who trained me, Gus Doomas. He used to work this neck of the woods during the Coolidge administration. He talked my ear off about it so darn much, I decided when I retired, I'd come up here and check the place out for myself. He's the guy who told you about the tunnels? Gus used to bust rum-runners back during the prohibition days. Seems they used these tunnels to run their moonshine from the waterfront into the town. As I understand it, the tunnels go back to 1700's. Used to be a fort here once upon a time. What does all of this have to do with Eleanor? I can't tell you for sure, Miss Edwards. Only she seemed really interested in those tunnels. In high, out low, you know how it goes. I had no idea you and Eleanor were so close. I just thought you were someone who stood on the edge of town and said hello to everyone. There's some things a man doesn't talk about, Miss Edwards. Some things are private.

Do you know where I can find any old maps of the area going back to the early settlement? I can help you with that, Mr. Hart. ♪♪♪ This is the town square, Maple Street, the hotel, the fort was built right here. Right where, Mr. H? Right here, Max. Right where we're standing right now. So the tunnels must go out from here to the ocean. That would explain how Mayor Trout ended up in the water without ever leaving the museum. Eleanor's note said something about looking beneath the surface to find out what was impeding the survival of the town. She also said the museum was on shaky ground. What's this all about, Mr. H? My best guess, Max? Oil. -Yowzer, that's it. -That's what? The boats. Captain Jack's boats. In high, out low, hot dog. What's he talking about? The boats are going out low on the water line but coming back high. So instead of bringing fish, someone is taking something out. It's all beginning to make sense. You remember the first night when we were in the park. -I smelled methane gas. -Methane. Yes, someone is pumping oil out of Kingman's Ferry onto those fishing boats. A by-product is methane gas. If they're pumping gas underground then they have to exhaust it some way. So, the street lamps. Ha, very clever. [APPLAUSE] Mayor Trout said this town is becoming downright musical. Those concerts are covering up the pumping, and who puts on the concerts? Captain Jack. Heya. ♪♪♪ [JONATHAN GRUNTS] I'm sure pipes go through the caves right to where we found Charlie and Max.
