- Nobody believes him, you know. Other doctors, hospital administrators, they fight him. They think he's dangerous. He feeds on the conflict and pushes harder. It only hurts him. - Well, things are pretty different around here, and it's exciting, but the medicine is upside down. I sure hope he's right. - Oh, he is right. Well. I believe he's right. He's got rules, but they're his own rules for this kind of medicine. Nobody believes him, because he... he pushes them, he threatens egos. You know, Tex, when we started out in the '60s, no one thought there was a problem, until Dr. Cowley told them there was a problem. You know, for people under 30, trauma is the biggest killer. Accidental injury. Car accidents are the worst. It's just a, well it's a big problem. It touches everybody. Oh, it's a friend, or a relative. And doctors just seem to accept that when a person was that badly hurt, well... they died. Everybody thought that but R Adams Cowley. Back then there were just a few of us. Cowley and I, a young nurse, Jill. Jill Jackson. And we had one bed in a little corner of University Hospital. They'd only send us patients they thought were too far gone. They called us the Death Lab. Dr. Cowley had a... well, an unorthodox philosophy. - [Cowley] People shouldn't die. - [Liz] Well, of course they shouldn't die, but they do. - No, I mean it. There's got to be a way to stop it. To get in the way of the process, to keep the process of dying from continuing. - We're seeing the worst of it right here in our little corner. - Yeah, we sure got our share of it. - Other hospitals only send us the worst. - They only trust us with the ones they can't save. No wonder they call us the Death Lab. - Okay, Paul, that's it! Let's go, take it ahead. Yeah, bit more. Take it on ahead. - Hey, Kenny, look out! [screaming] [crashing rubble] [sirens] - [Nurse] Okay, bring that gurney over here. Give me a hand to get him out. What happened? - [EMT] Construction accident. - [Nurse] How many have we got? - [EMT] Two here and more on the way. We picked him up at the site. He was face down under a ton of bricks. They said he fell five stories. Looks like chest and possible head injuries. - Tell him we need more help out here! Give me a hand to get this guy out! - Get his neck in control. Get ahold of it, that's it. - Yeah. - Put traction on that neck! Hold it steady til we get the stretcher. - I got it. - Okay. - What happened? - Construction accident. He looks bad, his pressure's nearly flat. - Let's get this guy into X-ray. - He's too far gone. I gotta get to the others. - You can't just leave him! - Take him to Cowley's Death Lab. - Ready to lift? - Yeah... they take the ones who are... too dead to go anywhere else and too alive to bury. Come on, let's go. - Vital signs? - Pressure is just about flat. Peripheral pulse is very weak. [Liz voiceover] You know, every time someone came into that lab, it was a new challenge to us. You see, we had to fight to prove that we could keep trauma victims alive. That we could do what nobody else could do. - Uh-Oh. Good chance the liver's lacerated. Alright, prep him in the OR. - [Liz] Send a blood sample up to hematology right away. And wait for a cross match. - Thanks, Dr. McCall, I'm happy you're helping. - Dr. Cowley, I cannot assist you in a... - Look! He's got no blood pressure. We've got no anesthesiologist. Now either you help, or he dies. - Come with me, Dr. McCall. [heart monitor beeping] - His name? - John Grady, white, male, apparent age 32. - Hmm. What have we got? - Multiple fractures. Tibia, femur, flailed chest, upper vertebrae, skull. Probably no neurological trauma. Puncture wounds in the lower abdomen... lots of 'em. He must have fallen on something sharp. - Mmm. That'll be internal trauma, bleeding. And I'm ready to go in. Dr. McCall? - Is that the total diagnosis? I don't know if the man's allergic to anything. - That's battlefield medicine. We have no choice. Because otherwise he'll surely die. - Well, alright. Patient is sedated, but he's not very stable. - Here we go, John Grady, best we know how. You stay with us, you hear? - [Nurse] Get more sterile sponges and another chest pack! [machine hissing] Get to hematology and find out if we're gonna get cross-matched blood this month or next! - Get that suction! - Well, come on, he's still losing blood. - Pressure's down again. He's on the edge. - Liver's perforated too. He's leaking in a dozen places. - Alright, then pack him! Get it stopped! Don't worry about being neat. - Blood pressure's falling. - Will you get him patched! - Doctor, I've only got two hands! - Here, give me some room. - Wait a minute! - You don't have the experience yet. Now back off! - Okay. - And lift, and down. - Miss Jackson, get that blood hung. And get me some suction. He's still with us. - He's young and strong. They give up too easily downstairs. All we gotta do now is keep you alive, Grady. We will. - [Little Girl] Oh, here he is. Oh, there he is. - Excuse me, Doctor. I'm Carolyn, Mrs. John Grady. We've been here waiting to hear news about my husband for quite some time, can you help us? - I'm sorry, I'm not a doctor. I'm the hospital administrator. - Well, maybe you can tell us what's happening to my son! All they told us is they're operating on him. - They sent us up here. Where are we? - Well, it's a special unit. I'm sure he's getting the best of care. - Ah, Mrs. Grady? - Yes. - I'm Dr. Cowley. - How is he? - Well, he's stable now. It may be a few days before he's out of the woods. We're having him monitored, somebody's gonna be sitting beside him and looking at him at all times. So why don't you go home, and we'll call you just as soon as something... - No, I'll wait here. [beeping] - [Liz] We were monitoring patients on the hour. Now, nobody had ever done that before. It seemed to take up all our time, but we were learning. Every patient was different, every one was important, and every one taught us something new. [orchestral music] [faster beeping] - Dr. Cowley, it doesn't look good. His VPB's beginning to go into v-tach. Jill, Jill... get the paddles! [flatlining] Ready. Synchronizer on. Stand back. [erratic beeping] - One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand. [flatlining] One thousand, two thousand. - Come on, Grady! Come on! We're fightin' like mad for you, you gotta help us. Will you help us? - One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, five thousand. - All indicators flat. - [Jill] One thousand, two thousand, - Grady, would you help us please, huh? Come on! [flatlining] Alright, get me intracardiac adrenaline. - Right. No pressure. [flatlining] No pulse. [mournful music] - Oh. Alright, pronounce him dead, 7:14. - Any change? Here's Dr. Cowley. - Is he alright? - Mrs. Grady, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but your husband didn't make it. - What do you mean? What do you mean, I thought this was a special place! - Carolyn... - He's dead? - He didn't feel any pain, however. He just... never woke up. - I'll be alright. [crying] - Mrs. Grady, I can assure you that everything humanly possible was done. Dr. Cowley is one of the finest cardiac surgeons in the country. Your husband was given the best medical care possible. Best. - Why don't you go home? - I can't. I mean, I don't want to. No, I mean, I can't. You know, things are happening around here that... may be too important. I keep going over data... and I know that the answers are in there somewhere. But I've been getting a sense of a pattern of dying. You know, we isolate death. We shouldn't do that, it's part of everybody's life. It has to be that. But I keep trying to... accept it. And I hope maybe I can understand it if I do. [chuckles] And then maybe on the other hand I'm just going senile. And I sure can't walk away from it. Liz, it's not good at home any longer. Everything between us is stretching, farther and farther away. My daughter's almost grown up, and I know that every day I'm moving... slowly but surely, farther away from home. And into this place. Does that make me... What? - You're a great man, Cowley. - [Cowley] Great? Come on. - Look, I don't know about your marriage, it... I'm sorry about it. But I do know that what's being accomplished here is great. - Everything possible was not done! It took nearly two hours to get the man there, and when he arrived I did not have the people I needed! - RA, what are you talking about? - Dr. Cowley, I want to talk... - And then I had to go find my own anesthesiologist! - There's always one on call! - On call? There's another delay I don't need. And I'm short of nurses, and assisting surgeons who are still in training. - Hey, just hold on! - You're promising, my friend, but you haven't had enough practice yet. I fought to get this unit so we could learn something, not to just repeat the mistakes of history! - RA.... I'll see that you get some help with the supplies, alright? - And an anesthesiologist on staff, on duty! - You know what that would cost? - Money! You know what it would save? Lives. - That is a cheap shot. - I apologize for that, Elton. I'm sorry. Do we get the anesthesiologist? - I'll try. Maybe on a timesharing basis. - We really need one. - I will try. - I know you will. Thank you, sir. - That was quite a performance. - I don't just practice medicine, I practice politics. I am forced to play games. I have just gotten the piece of an anesthesiologist. That's a beginning. - And you took a piece out of me. What was that, Dr. Cowley? - That was the truth, Dr. Silverthorn. Why don't you learn to use it, to live with it. - I am human. I make mistakes. Does that cancel my MD? - No. But I'm going to arrange for you to be rotated into another service in the main hospital, alright? You've got good hands, and a good mind. But no fire in the belly. You'll have a terrific suburban practice, Doctor. Good day. [sirens] - [Liz] It only took us six more years to get our own building. Though we were still part of the University hospital. But we started to hire more staff, and build a team. And that's when you ran into him, for the first time. - Shock. Think of it as a pause in the act of dying, that's what I tell people. You think people die from accidents or heart attacks. But they really don't, not directly. Oh, you want some of this? - [Tex] I'm tryin' to cut down. - You sure? Alright. Well those things produce shock, which is a sluggish or nonexistent circulation, and that's what kills you. No oxygen. - What do you do about it, what's different here? - We've been working on this for six years now. - Alright, you tell me. A patient comes in to see you. What do you do? What's the first thing? - First, I take a history. - I see, you say, "Won't you sit down, sir?" And you sit in your chair, and you smile at him. And then you say very quietly and very slowly, "Have you ever had a heart attack, sir? "Are you a diabetic? "Is there cancer in your family?" - [Tex] That's right. - And then what? - Then I examine him. - Which prompts more questions. Where did that scar come from? Does that hurt? Have you always had those bumps? Alright, now the history and the examination are done with. Then what do you do? - I make a diagnosis. - And then you construct a treat, is that right? Except by then, our kind of patient is dead. We've got to get to them fast. Get inside 'em and ask questions later. - Now, can't that be malpractice? - Not when we keep them alive, Doctor. - [Radio] Trauma admission in one minute. [sirens] - What happened to the girl? - She's got head injuries, fractured right radius, left humerus, clavicle, probably the right femur, and she's got abdominal injuries. - Alright. What's her name? - Name's Lisa Silver. She's got an ID bracelet on. - Okay. What are you doing here, kid? This isn't your shift. - I tried to bust out. Liz tackled me in the hall. - Yeah, I'll bet. Where are her parents? - We're trying to get in touch with them now. She was by herself on a bike. She was hit by that guy over there. Wendell Moore is his name. He lost control of his car, he hit a railing, and then her. He's probably drunk. - Okay, Lisa. I think maybe we got a couple of broken bones. And maybe a little trouble with the tummy. - I don't think she can hear you, Doc. - Oh, she can hear me alright. She's unconscious, but... deep down in her, she can hear every word I say. Can't ya, honey? - Sheryl, let's get some IVs now. - Dr. Cowley! This man's chest is crushed. He's probably had a stroke. - Here. - Has he been crossed and typed yet? - That's why he lost control. Not drunk, only dying. - [Tex] That's right. - Get him into the OR. - Liz, you try and get in touch with his personal physician, see what you can find out? - [Cowley] Tell him I have to go in rightnow! - He's a little old. Think he can live through that? - He can't live without it. - She's coming around. [girl stirs] You're in the hospital now, honey. We're gonna take good care of you. - Can you take over Lisa? - Alright. - [Liz] Give me another orderly. We're gonna need somebody to bag him on the way to OR. And tell me the minute we hear from his doctor. - Hey, Lisa. My name's Tex. I'm gonna be your doctor. Gonna cut that shirt away, now? You got some eyebrows on you, don't you? Pretty nose. [beeping] - The patient is 80 over 50. Hey, we'd better get neurology up here as soon as we can to check him over. - Mm, look at that, Miguel. - The tissue is poor. The lung has really been ripped up by that rib. - Yeah, that part of the lung has almost been destroyed. Well, it's gonna be a long night, ladies and gentlemen. The odds become very long with somebody this old. - And I had a date. - Ah, what's the matter, Dr. Aruba? Won't she wait for you? - Of course she will, Liz. The only question is with who? - Pick up. - Now turn the head a bit so I can have a look. Healthy tissue, young bones. Won't even be a scar, on the face, at least. Hope they can patch up a bicycle as good. - I could ask that trooper to bring it in for you. - I saw the way he gave you the once-over. I'm sure he'd do a favor for you and bring it in. - I don't date cops. They're always in too much of a hurry. - Why don't we just concentrate on Lisa? She's a little young for this debate. Stay cool, honey. Let's see what's going on in that belly. - [Liz] Jill... - [Nurse] The parents have arrived. They're waiting in the family service area for you, Doctor. - Now Lisa is sedated right now, so why don't you two go home, get some rest yourself, and you can see her in the critical care recovery unit in the morning. - Um... Will there be, you know, scars? - No, not on her face. She'll be fine, she did real well. She's a sweetie. - Thank you, Doctor. - Please. - Excuse me, Doctor. I'm Wendell Moore's sister. They notified me that he was in an accident. - Yeah, um, wanna sit down? - Let me get this out of your way. - Excuse me. - Is it Mrs.? - Uh, Miss. - Well he has suffered a stroke, Ma'am, and that is what caused the accident. He's in surgery right now, and it is pretty serious. - Why, I understand, Doctor. Thank you. Oh, I will be quite alright. - We'll keep you in the know. - BP's fine. - [Nurse] Ok, let's open another chest pack, ok? Get out the clamps and the short pickup. - [Liz] No, we have enough, but check on neurology, they should have been here by now. - [Nurse] Changing IVs. - [Liz] I think we should weigh these sponges. [machine hissing] [soft piano music] - Yes? - We just got some data back on Mr. Moore from his doctor. It seems that Mr. Moore has had a recent stroke, and his doctor indicated it would be risky to operate. He's 70 years old. - Pressure's 95 over 70, and he's stable. - 70 years old, and tough as a boot, aren't you, sir? And indicated or not, here we are. Now tie that off, would you Miguel? - Got it. - [Cowley] High risk, high reward. Mr. Moore, I think you've made it. Close him up, huh. - Thank you. - When they brought Lisa in, they said she was in shock. - I'm sure the doctors have taken care of that, Mr. Silver. - But my wife, she's had quite a shock too, with all this happening. - Of course. But you see, it isn't the same thing. Your wife has had an emotional shock, a psychological jolt. Lisa has had a physical shock to her system. - What does that mean? - Let me try to explain to you and your wife. - [Liz] We're dealing with people in terrible pain. It's tough to live with every day. It's a... well, it consumes you. There's no home life. Do you know how many doctors here are divorced? So we all look for a release. Cowley paints, collects cars, builds model airplanes. Jill Jackson? Well, Jill leads a pretty fast life outside of the hospital. But we fight the fatigue and the tension. Some of us better than others. - How's everything goin' in there? - Fine. - Lisa gonna be okay? - Who? - Lisa... Lisa, the little girl. - Yeah, she's gonna make it. - Great, great. It's a great place you got here. How do you like your new premises? - What? - New building. How do you like it? - Fine. [whistling] - I still don't understand why you have to keep all these cars outside. - I got two or three more in the garage. Since we sold the house I don't know where to keep the things. - What's it been, four or five months now? - What, since the separation? - Yeah. - Been about six, I think. All the paperwork's done. Nobody hates anybody. It's all been cauterized very efficiently. - [Liz] But you got the cars. - Oh, boy did I get the cars! It's about all I got. - And the trauma center. - The trauma center, my dear, is my mistress. [whistling] - Jill? Jill! - Hi, kid. - Is something wrong? - I'm glad you're both here. I wanted to talk. - You alright? - Just wanna talk. - Okay, we'll talk. Why don't we go inside? - I don't know. Do you, uh... Do you think I'm burning out? - We've been through this such a long time, and we all knew the pressure. We all feel the same way. - No, I know, but I mean I find myself just walking the streets after my shift. Looking for lights... some laughing... I... I don't know. - Jill, come on! What's on your mind, what are you thinking about? - Maybe leaving. I was thinking maybe I'd go to Las Vegas. - Why would anyone want to go to Las Vegas? - Well I can think of a couple of reasons. [laughing] - It's alive there, right? - Right. - Well here, it's so... - Dead? - Yeah. Depressing. You know. - Yeah, I know. - All we see is, uh, mutilation... people dying. I never get to see a new baby, I never even get to just fix a cut finger. - We all feel that kind of pressure. - You just tell us what we can do and we're yours. - I... don't wanna leave. - Good. [somber music] - Just fine. Now Lisa, I know you can't speak, so listen up, hmm? Now you're gonna be here, in the critical care unit, for another couple weeks. And then some physical therapy. - Sorry, Doctor, it's time for Lisa's bath. - I haven't finished yet, nurse. Now, Lisa, I'm not gonna lie to you. You are gonna have to work at that therapy, but if you do, you'll be able to play sports and dance and everything you want. Dr. Cowley? - Yes. Oh, Doctor. Good job with surgery on her, Lisa. Matter of fact, you're really quite adequate. - I've been thinking. - In what direction? - Well, I'd like to be a little more than adequate. I'd like to join your team. - Alright. - Just like that? - Just like that. You're a very good surgeon. But I've been more interested in the way you follow up on your surgery. - What, Lisa? She's... she's a nice kid. - Yeah. But, uh... Tex... nice or nasty, child or senile senescent, we got a rule around here that goes something like this... Either treat the patient as a human being, or don't treat human beings. You got it? - I got it. You're the director. - So I am. I'll arrange the paperwork as soon as I've seen my patient. It'll be good to have you with us. - I forgot to count your toes. - Excuse me, Doctor. Lisa hasn't had a bath yet, nor has she had her medication, which means no visitors. - What are you talkin' about, Nurse? She's my patient, I performed the surgery on her. - This is a critical care unit, Doctor. Lisa Silver is my responsibility now. - Nurse, who do you think you are? - Andrea Davidson. - And who's your superior? - [Liz] I am. Can I have a word with you, please? Look, let's get something straight. I don't want you talking to the nurses like that. - Like what? - Ah, look, Tex, I'm sorry but I forgot to tell you about rule number two... which is, that nurses are to be treated as professionals. - You know, equally. - Ah, equally, yes, thank you very much. - Now, you're the thoracic surgeon. Diagnosis, procedure, total authority in the OR, right? But when the patient comes up here and Andy takes over, you both work as a team, right? - Since when do nurses make medical decisions? - Every nurse I know makes a dozen a day. - That's right, I agree with that. As a matter of fact, I call them little doctors. - They are not little doctors. They're nurses! Doctors don't know how to nurse! Doctors determine medication and treatment. But every patient that comes to CCRU is assigned a primary nurse, who is responsible for the care of that patient for - [Both] as long as they're here. - Right. - Yes, sir. I mean, yes ma'am. - Davidson's responsible here. - Davidson's responsible here. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to start a war. Excuse me. CCRU? Hello, Mrs. Silver, it's Andy. Well, why don't you say hello to her? No, she can't speak to you, yet, but she can hear every word you say. Uh-huh. Hold on. It's Lisa's mother. Would you like to do the honors? - Yes, ma'am. It's for you. Listen up. - [Mother] Hello, Lisa? How are you? Are they taking good care of you, honey? Both Daddy and I love you very much. We miss you. [smooth jazz] - Well, we know one reason for, uh, unnecessary death after major surgery. Shock lung. It drives me crazy when we can't oxygenate our patient and he drowns in his own fluids. - Because of inefficient ventilators to breathe for the patient, then. - Yes exactly. I mean this is a... we have to use this, this piece of cheap medical machinery. I mean, that's what I've got to work with! How would you have liked to use a hacksaw instead of a scalpel? - Alright, what do you need? - What do I need? Oh. This. The Ingstrom 300. Look. - How much does it cost? - Look, it's called the Ingstrom, that beautiful piece of work, look at that. - Hmm? - Oh... - How much? - Now with that we really could do things. - How much? - See, there's not very many of those around. - How much? - Beautiful thing, isn't it? - How much? - Well, it's, - How much? - It's a little over 6,000. Look at what... - How much? - Well, to be exact, it's 8,000. - Mmmhmm. - We need three. - This is embezzlement! - You authorized the funds, Elton. - For part-time nurses! - The Ingstrom works full time! It'll save lives, it'll give us data, it's absolutely necessary. - You know perfectly well it's dangerous and unethical to use these mechanical breathers the way you want to. You plug them in before you're sure they'll need it! - But we can't afford to wait, can we? - Elton, may I remind you that you're the one who really authorized the money? So it seems to me that we're all in this together, wouldn't you say? - I've spent my working life with doctors. They're all arrogant. But you! I can't cancel the order on that. But from now on, I am going to personally monitor your accounts, from a paper clip on up! - He'll do you all the harm he can, you know? - I think he will. Come on. - [Jill] Oh, he is right. Well... I believe he's right. He's got rules, but they're his own rules for this kind of medicine. The fact is, we are keeping people alive here. - Yeah, but I don't know why. Liz, I've seen young, strong men die. Now we got this 70-year-old guy, he's much more serious, he's doing just fine. I would like to know why. - We would all like to know why. That's what we're doing here. - I had 15 years experience as an army surgeon. Let me tell you something. I could never figure out why a certain percentage of my patients died. - Shock. - Yes. Upstairs, right now, we've got an 11-year-old girl and a 70-year-old man, both coming along very nicely, thank you, and why aren't they in shock? - Tough, or lucky. - Hmmph. That's not an answer, that's an evasion. Death isn't an event, it's a process. And something, sometimes in the accident, or in the treatment, triggers that process, and kills them. - Well, what about the severity of accident? - Well, look at the research data, that's not the total answer either. Severe accidents live, milder ones die. But not right away, a week or two later, they go into irreversible shock and they die. And you know why? Time. That's the connection. We didn't get to them fast enough. - Time? How much time? - Unfortunately, we haven't figured that out yet. But we do know the shorter amount of time, the better. - So what do we do about it? - To start with, we've got a good group here. But we have to develop... - Where's Jill? - ...a really fine... ...crack team, with a system that works almost perfectly. So that we're totally ready, so that no patient ever has to wait for treatment. We've got to get patients in the right amount of time to the right place, with the right people, and then we have a chance... to give them a chance. - Sorry about the foul-up, Doc. - Foul up? You know his name? - Dave Ryerson. He's on the junior high football team... ...took a bad fall in a pileup, then rammed into the bench. They took him to the University clinic. - What? - Yeah, laid there half an hour before somebody noticed he had cracked ribs and a hemothorax. - Now, his chest's full of fluid, let's get him in the OR. - Then we took him to Memorial Hospital. - Boy, that Memorial emergency's are too confused. They got one intern on duty, they got no staff, they got no framework. What did they do when they saw him? Panic? - Just about, Doc. They sent us right on over here. Poor kid's had a complete tour. [patient groaning] - Well, he's young and he's strong, maybe he'll get lucky. Thanks. - [EMT] You guys don't waste much time here, do ya? [beeping] - Pressure's 80 over 50, and dropping. - He's been bleedin' internally for hours. Talk about shock. - Do you want more gauze? How's he doing? - [McCall] Still dropping. - Cement. [erratic beeping] [flatlining] [Tex] Alright. Just gonna be fine. We'll get you right into that back field again. There. Come on. Come on, get in there. One more sponge. That's it. Hold just fine. Get you back on that team again. Oh, give me that! Come on now. Come on, come on. [pumping] That's it. You just pretend like you're catchin' a pass, and I'm throwin' it. [Tex] Come on, come on! Come on! Come... - Alright, stop it. - Just give me a chance. Give me two more minutes. I can bring him back, he's young. - No, Tex, he's dead. Come on, now. Come on. Watch it. [mournful music] - You never expect it to happen to... to you. It's pretty hard to believe. - No, but... he was fine! This morning, when he went to school. [sobbing] - He died very quickly. I don't, I don't think he felt any pain. - But why couldn't you do something? I've heard about this place, you're supposed to save him! - I wish I had the answer. I'm sorry. - Oh, I never should have let him play football. It's my fault. Oh! [weeping] - What can you do for me, Sarah? I feel just as bad as she does. - You can lean on me, too, Doctor. That's why I'm here. [explosion] [dramatic music] [sirens] - Hey, some of the men are badly burned! Give me a hand over here! Help me with this guy! - Stay back! [both men yelling] - No! - Stay back! - Let me go! - [Policeman] Come back out of there! Get away from there! Get away! - It's Kowalski! He's burning! Get him covered over! Quick! Let's get him to an ambulance! - No, no! Get me to the trauma clinic. - That's halfway across the city! - Get me there! Billy, get a copter! - Is there a police chopper nearby? We got an emergency. Kowalski's been hurt bad. [helicopter blades] - I'll get the door! - [Nurse] Where's Dr. Cowley? Kowalski's a trooper. - Get over here with that stretcher! - I'm trying to get a pulse. - This guy is burned bad! What other injuries does he have? - Hold him steady. - Watch his neck! - Okay, let's go. - Get him over there! - What happened to him? - Gas line blew. Got burned and busted up pretty bad. - How long ago? - 12 minutes. - [EMT] Check the police headquarters, find out what his blood type is. - [Other EMT] Okay, I'll get on it. [dramatic music] - [Liz] I'm gonna need arterial blood gas. Jackson, move it! - Pulse is stable. - Easy landing. - He had unusual blood clots, Doctor. - Hi, Kowalski. - Dr. Cowley. - Yes. - I told them to bring me here. - Good. You've always been a bright guy. Looks like you're gonna make it fine. - He's got a broken ankle, simple fracture. You've really done yourself up, didn't you? Let's get some X-rays, let's take a neck to rule out a spinal cord injury, and the chest. - Oh, c'mon, what are you doin'? - [Cowley] Just part of the routine. Relax, huh. - Alright, move it. It's open. - Where's X-ray? - Let's get some IVs into him. On those X-rays, give me a lateral C spine and a flat plated chest. - Cover up! Are you alright? - Yes. - [X-ray tech] Okay, everybody, we'll shoot the first X-ray at the count of three. Well now, you passed that mini-lap with flying colors. - [Cowley] Tex. - Oh my God. - What's the matter? - It looks like a torn aorta. Give me five IV Valium. - [Kowalski] What is it, what's wrong? - Gene, your aorta, that's the largest artery coming out of your heart. It was torn when you hit. But it can be repaired in surgery. Now you're gonna be alright. I'm gonna do the job myself. You trust me, don't you? Okay. - [Liz] Jill? Where's Jill? - What is it you want, Elton? - This hospital is about to welcome a new department head, uh... Dr. Jordan Tracy. Heard of him? - Yes, of course. He's a surgeon with a fine academic background. I understand he wants to head up a major hospital. - Oh, he's not going to head our university hospital. Not yet. Just chief of surgery. As you know, the uh... trauma center is part of the surgery department. And that puts him in complete charge of it. And of you. [soft piano music] [buzzing] - Uh, yeah, just a minute. Hold on. Just a minute! [buzzing continues] Ah, hi, come in. - Hi. - What's the matter? - I'm worried about Jill. - Oh? - Somebody saw her yesterday. - Yeah? - But she didn't come into work today. - Well did you phone her, her apartment? - There was no answer. - Well I better admit to you that I've been very worried about her myself. You know, the last four or five days I've been getting reports that she's been absolutely weird. - Yeah, I know. Look, uh... why don't you come over to her apartment with me? - You mean right now? - Yeah. I just feel like something's wrong. - Well yeah, sure, why not. You got your car? [soft instrumental music] [knocking] - [Liz] Jill? Jill, are you home? Jill! Jill, let us in! - [Cowley] Hey, Jill! - No! I knew it! She's gone, isn't she? - Her heart stopped. She's dead. Hey, kid. You know somethin'? You're very special. - [Liz] Yeah, it's Liz. Listen, I need an ambulance. No, no no... no, it's okay. Too late for that. - [Superintendent] I've heard of you, Dr. Cowley. As a matter of fact, you didn't need to use Sergeant Kowalski's name to get in to see me. - Well, I don't like to take chances. - Neither do I. So we're both in the wrong profession. - Right. Thank you. - How can I help you? - What do you know about the trauma center? - Very little. But my men think your operation is good, and they handle a lot of the violent accidents in this state, so I trust their judgment. - I'm sorry to have to tell you sir, but they're wrong. - Oh? - Our operation is only fair. It could be a lot better. Gene Kowalski is alive because he was brought in to us in minutes by helicopter. - So? - So, together, Superintendent, you and I, we can help to save a lot of lives. - Oh, I see where you're going. But we only have two choppers, and no free time. - How would you like two more? - A lot. A lot. But how? - I've got a federal grant, and some clout. Now you have political access, and a lot of clout. I'm suggesting a beneficial partnership. You get two more choppers, we get to place trained paramedics on all of them. - And so? - And... we get absolute priority in medical emergencies. - [Dr. Tracy] That's a remarkable achievement. But the picture doesn't do you justice. [Cowley chuckles] I must tell you, it's... I'm really pleased to meet you. - I've been looking forward to it, Dr. Tracy. Won't you sit down? - Thank you. Call me Jordan, please. I understand you lost one of your nurses. - Yes, that's right. Cardiac arrest. We really don't know why. - I'm awfully sorry. I have to tell you, I've read a number of your articles. I'm very impressed by what you've accomplished with the trauma unit. It's gonna be exciting working with you. - Well thank you, Doctor, I'm flattered. - Dr. Tracy's a first class administrator. The place will run a lot smoother when he takes over. - Oh, come on, Elton, I'm not taking over. I'll just be running some bureaucratic interference for you, freeing you up to do your work. - Do you know what my work is, Dr. Tracy? - Well I'm afraid I'm not up on all of your projects, but uh... you just send me a memo on each one and we'll talk them over. - Unfortunately, I'm really not very good at paperwork. - That's alright. I am. And I'm going to give you some help in that direction. Sam! Sam, I want you to meet Dr. R Adams Cowley, Sam Hooker. - Hello... Doctor? - No. Hospital administrator. - And he's good. I'm assigning Sam to your center. He'll handle all the paperwork, and take it off your hands. - I see. Aren't you afraid that I might, uh... lose touch with things around here under these conditions? - Not to worry. Anything you need to know, just ask Sam. Or myself. - Anytime, Dr. Cowley. - Of course. Of course. [chuckles] Of course. - Well, it hasn't been the best couple of days, has it? Jill... and now this snake Tracy. - Ah, enough of that. Here's to us. To all of us. And most especially, to Jill. - To Jill. - Jill. - [Radio] Syscom, am I through? - This is Sycom. Go ahead. - This is Trooper Harris. We've got a multiple on route 17 just by the Green Street offramp. I'll get back to you. - Roger. We'll await word. - You know, just starting to get things to work right. Now, these people here, they coordinate where the helicopters are. - Chopper two, this is Syscom. Please stand by. We may have an emergency near Route 17 and Green Street. - Syscom, this is Trooper Harris. Looks worse than we thought. - Who makes the medical determination? - In the field, the paramedics. - That's practicing medicine. I can't accept that. - Paramedics are trained. Cowley feels that most doctors are ignorant of on-the-spot emergency medicine. - What bloody arrogance. - Syscom, this is Trooper Harris again. - Go ahead. - We've got two dead and two seriously injured. We'll need a second chopper. - Roger, chopper on the way. - Chopper two, this is Syscom. - This is two. Go ahead. - We've got a Med-Evac emergency. Route 17 and Green Street. - Syscom... this is Two. I've got the Governor in here. - You're closest to the scene, Two. - Roger. Sorry, Governor. We've got a Med-Evac call. Have to set you down. I'll radio a police car to get you. - Hey, wait a minute! [helicopter blades] - [Governor] What's a Med-Evac? - I don't know. [sirens] - Go on! Keep it moving! Don't slow down, folks! Keep it moving! - Don't move around too much. Just be still. [helicopter blades] - Come on! Give em a hand! - Paramedic! Over here! He's hardly breathing. He was driving. He took the wheel in his chest. - Let me get an airway into him. Open his mouth for me! - Is that a doctor or a paramedic? - Paramedic. - I'm a doctor. What're you doing? - Inserting an airway. Dr. McCall helped design these. - That's enough. - What are you... - Doctor, please! It's... it's not a regular airway. I told you! - I don't know who Dr. McCall is, but I know it has to go deeper, into the trachea. And don't you tell me off! - Look, it doesn't go down that way! Look he's not breathing at all. His lips are turning blue! You've got it down the wrong way! - You fix it. - [Officer] Okay folks, let's keep moving. Keep it moving. Come on folks! Move it along, now. Move along, everybody. - This is outrageous. - Yes, I agree it's outrageous. - We're not talking the same language, Doctor. How dare you make a charge like this, opening us up for a lawsuit! - Because it's the truth. People are dying because of ignorance and incompetence and a pathetic attempt to practice trauma medicine. - Sir... you try and understand that you cannot make accusations about other doctors like this! - In the field, paramedics know what to do. Doctors don't have that training. The doctor was dead wrong. - That is not the point! You can't do it in the papers! - I already have. [bright music] Hello, Kowalski. - Come to check on me again, Dr. Cowley? - No, it's just a social visit. Unless you'd rather read. - No, no. I got plenty of time. - Yeah. - It is thanks to you guys. - Ah. You have any idea what you've done for us? - What are you talkin' about? - The helicopter. You're the one who gave us the idea. - That's right, I gave you the idea. - [Cowley] You sure did. - You know, I think you're right. I think, uh, I'm gettin' smarter. - No doubt about that, absolutely. [rapid beeping] Kowalski? [flatlining] Kowalski! Bring a crash cart! - [Liz] It's Kowalski! We've got V-tach! - No pressure. - 100 lidocaine. - Mm-Hmm. Come on, Gene! Stay with us! - Give me pads. 200. - [Liz] Synchronized. - Stand clear. [beeping resumes] - Yeah, he's stabilizing. - Well, I usually handle these crises all by myself. Nice to have such distinguished company. - That thing telling us anything? - Oh, yes. I'm starting to get some interesting correlations. I'm... I'm going back. Ah, you remember Lisa Silvers and Wendall Moore? - Yeah, sure, I remember. What was the name of that young kid, the one Tex got so upset about? - Oh, yes, Ryerson. I've got him in here, too. - Good. Cause I've got some thoughts that I want to try out. - Uh-Huh. - Maybe we can narrow down the time element. How quickly do we have to get a patient here? How many hours? How many minutes? - Okay. I'm, uh, setting it up to correlate the mortality rate with the length of time before treatment. - Exactly. - [McCall] And the one common factor is severity. They were all pretty badly hurt. - [Liz] Did any of these patients die during surgery? - [McCall] Most of them got through that pretty successfully. - Alright. Let's start with 12 hours, huh. That's from injury until surgery, right? - Right. [beeps] No, 12 is pretty well 100% fatality with that. - Try six hours. - [Sam] Dr. Cowley, I have to talk to you. - Not now, I'm busy, can't you see that? - This is important. - What I'm doing is more important. - [Sam] Dr. Cowley, could we talk alone? - No! Well, six hours isn't it. - [Liz] Try four hours. - Yeah, try four. - [McCall] Four, there. - The administrator's office has directed me to inform you that Dr. Tracy has brought charges against you. - What? - Professional insubordination. You'll have to appear before the Administration Operations Committee. - That's crazy. What does Tracy want? - You fired from this hospital. - Alright, let's try three hours. Well, come on, come on. - [Nurse] Come on, son, stay with me! We're almost there! - [Nurse] We're taking her down to ICU. She's gonna be okay. We're gonna need a lot more rooms here. There's lots of them coming in. - Watch out for this one. Her name's Mary. She tried to bite me. Lucky she didn't. She's in enough trouble after what she did to her husband's Porsche. - Porsche... isn't that a deluxe VW? - [Mary] Let me up! You know who my husband is? - [Nurse] Stop! We're just trying to help you! - I know, and it hurts you worse than it hurts me. just take it easy. - I can't! Why can't you leave me alone? - We're gonna do a Mini-Lap. Now, listen Mary. I think you've got some internal injuries. Now I'm gonna give you a little injection. It's a local anesthetic. Then I'm gonna make a small incision in your lower abdomen, find out what's goin' on in there, mmm? Local. - If you cut me, I'll sue you! - Has anybody talked to this lady's husband? - Can't find him. We're still calling. - Contusion in the upper left quadrant. It's probably a ruptured spleen. Now, Mary... we feel that with the bruise in your abdomen, and your blood pressure, that you've probably got some internal bleeding. Now I need some permission to do that procedure I talked to you about. - No... - [Tex] Mary, you know what's gonna happen if I don't stop that internal bleeding? - Go away! - [Tex] You're gonna die. If I can't stop that internal bleeding, you are gonna die. And it's gonna hurt a long time before you die. - [Mary] Just give me a shot for the pain. - We've given you all we can. Now we'll give you some when it's over. But right now I gotta do the belly tap! Mary? - I'm not really gonna die, am I? - You just might. There's a good chance. Now I'm gonna do that procedure. I'm gonna do the belly tap. Is that okay? Mary, if it's not okay with you, if you don't say okay, I'm not gonna do it. - [Mary] No, no! - Alright, if that's what you want. - No, wait. I don't wanna die. - That's up to you. - Alright. Go ahead. - [Tex] Let's go. [gasping] - Too much publicity, too many stories about miracle treatments. Now every time anybody gets hurt, or think they got hurt... right into Shock Trauma. We've handled 60% more patients than last year. - Doctor, you've hit us with everything from logic to emotion. - Well, I deal in both. - Well we have to deal in reality. Budgets. Money. We have to deal with the Legislature, and they have to deal with the University Hospital. - Ah, but you see, there's the problem. There are too many layers. Look, I need to deal directly to operate independently. Look why don't you come down to Shock Trauma? See what we're doing, look us over. - We just may do that. - We'd better, so we don't get left on the highway again. - Look, I'd like to show you what we... found last night. - Afraid I'll get my chance. My wife's been taken to Shock Trauma. - Mary? - [McCall] She's stable, but she's in pretty rough shape. - Well gentlemen, it's going to be a short operation, and her chances are excellent. That's because she got here fast. Shall we go to the waiting room? - I'd rather stay here, if it's okay. - If you prefer. Ah, In that case, Governor, I've got something I'd like to show you, if you don't mind. You know, what we were discussing before? - Mmm-Hmm. - Uh, Doctor, will you keep an eye on the Governor's aide, see that he's alright? This way, Governor. - [Doctor] You can step a little closer if you like. [beeping] - [Nurse] Pressure is still falling. - Alright. Now we've set this thing up with a mass of patient information to correlate the mortality rate with the length of time before treatment. - To show exactly what? - It shows that there is a point in time, a cutoff point, and inside that time you have a very good chance of survival. - And how long is that time? - [Cowley] Well, I'm coming to that. - Eventually. - Well, I have to put on a little show for you, don't I, Governor? - I thought so. - Where was I? - Well, you were about to tell me how long. - Ah, yes, yes, yes. But not quite. Let's start with the premise that death is a process, and is triggered by shock. - [Governor] What does that mean? - [Cowley] What that means is that the body's cells die. They stop functioning, and they die because of lack of oxygen. The kidneys first, then the rest of the body, and finally the brain. The question is how soon does that happen? You see, we found that people were recovering, but a week, two weeks later, they'd develop complications and die. And it became apparent that there was a very clear time limit involved. - How long? - Death starts when perfusion stops. When the body reacts instinctively, cuts off blood supply to the cells, and without food and oxygen, the cells soon develop an energy crisis and die. - Okay, how long? - And then I thought back to the Korean War, and I thought to myself - 24 hours? 12 hours? - 12 hours, you say? Alright let's try 12 hours. 12 hours... I'm afraid you'r going to be appalled at what you see. [beeping] Almost 100% fatal. Let's try a quarter of that time. Let's try three hours. [beeping] It's closer, but not yet. Let's go half of that. Let's go 90 minutes. [beeping] - Less than 90 minutes. - Less. - How long? - One hour, Governor. 60 minutes. You watch this. [beeping] One golden hour. 60 precious minutes. And we can prove it now, Governor. We can prove it. If we can get to a patient inside that one hour, we can keep him alive. One miracle hour. It's that simple. - Simple? Do you realize that every emergency room in the world will have to adjust to what you've found? - Yes, I know. Now, Governor, if I had three teams of surgeons all working on different parts of the body at once, then do you realize I could... - Seems she's gonna be fine. - Why, that's great, Tom. - They're amazing. They're really amazing in there. [laughs] - [Governor] Thank you, Doctor. It's been quite an education. [bright music] - Dr. Cowley. - Yes? - Dr. Cowley, look, I'd like to talk to you. - Oh? What about? - Well, it's about my testimony at the hearing tomorrow. - You mean Dr. Tracy hasn't given it to you yet? - Now look, I resent that, Dr. Cowley! - And I resent having a one-man fifth column planted on me! But I can live with that. The real tragedy isn't me. It's what you and Tracy are doing to this center! To the practice of medicine. Here. I want you to be my guest. Data, facts... the details on what might have been a real breakthrough, but I... Oh, forget it. What am I wasting my time for. [dramatic music] [groans] [soft music] - I want to make clear that this is an informal hearing, not a trial. We simply intend to discuss certain issues which have been raised by Dr. Tracy. - I'm most anxious to hear them, sir. - I don't want to be vindictive, gentlemen. Nor do I feel that Dr. Cowley is incompetent. But he is careless. Sometimes very dangerously so. I've been concerned, so I've asked the administrator Mr. Hooker to go over the situation. I believe he can give us the facts. - Correction, Doctor. I know he can. - [Chairman] Mr. Hooker? - Gentlemen. I have observed Dr. Cowley's operation for some time now. And I've reviewed all of the reports, the staff filings, and the research data. I think it's possible that Dr. Cowley is one of the best medical scientists of our time. R Adams Cowley has made a quantum leap in trauma medicine. Where other emergency rooms are losing 80% of their trauma cases, Cowley's Center is reversing that trend. Last night, I read material on a... on a major discovery made by Dr. Cowley. I think it may be one of the most important developments in trauma medicine since the Korean War. But I'll let you gentlemen make up your own minds. As Dr. Cowley suggests, here are the facts. - Liz? - I thought I might find you here. - Come here. Look at this. It's sinking! - I have got some good news. - What? - Tom called, and uh... The Governor has just signed an executive order separating the Center from the University! - You're not serious? - We're independent. Shock Trauma is now yours. - Oh I can't believe that! [dramatic music] That's exactly why I... [helicopter blades] - [Radio] Shock Trauma, we've got a multiple smash up. At least five, six cars. God knows how many people. Send us help. - Roger. Chopper's on the way. Syscom out. - [Chopper] Syscom, this is Chopper Three. ETA to accident site, six minutes. [sirens] - Hang on, buddy. - [Chopper] Syscom, we're just arriving. Looks like it's gonna be a busy day. And send another chopper. - Hey, give me a hand with this other door! - Here, hold her head! - Come on, move it, move it, let's go! - What if this was a real emergency? How would you know? - [Woman] We know what we're doing, sir. - Oh, I'm sure you do, I wouldn't question that for a moment, but how do you know I haven't got something very seriously wrong with me, mmm? - [Woman] A doctor will be over in a moment. Just relax. - Mm. Just relax. - R Cowley? - Yes. - You are R Cowley? - Yes, I are R Cowley. - [Doctor] You sprained your ankle, sir? - Yes. - How did it happen? - I fell. Down. - [Doctor] You do have insurance? - [Chopper] Syscom? This is Chopper Two. We're just leaving the scene right now. Estimated time of arrival 15 minutes. We've got two on board. On the way. I'll score you in a minute. - [Woman] Roger Two. Syscom out. [sirens] - Pupils are dilated. She better be the next to go. [helicopter blades] - [Chopper] Syscom, this is Three, with vitals. One female Caucasian, about 18 years old. No name. I can't find any ID. She has chest and abdominal injuries, a fractured right leg. Pressure's dropping, pulse is erratic. She's in a lot of pain. The second is a male Caucasian about 30 years old. Lacerations to the face. Pressure's low, pulse is stable. - Is this the girl with the fractured leg? - Yes, it is. - Let's get her down to admitting. Hurry! Careful! - Now we're gonna take this guy down to resuscitation. [scoffs] - [Nurse] All his signs are stable. He's lost a lot of blood. - Anybody got a name on him? - Leroy Gaines. And he goes right into the prison wing as soon as he's ready. - Hold it, let me have a look at her. This the one with the head injury? You're too late. - Doctor, we can't make an identification on this one. - Then we give her a nickname. - Angie! - What? - Angie! That's Angela Baron. She's in my composition class, she's a music major. - Angela Baron? - I know her! - [Miguel] I want a chest tube in, and a Mini-Lap. More blood. - [PA] Nurse Miller, you're wanted at receiving. Nurse Miller. - Now what? - We're gonna get that ankle... - [Cowley] Hey! - of yours X-rayed. - Take it easy, will ya? You got a driver's license? - [Chopper] And his name is Paul Kehoe. White, male... 34, 35 years old. Serious internal bleeding. Looks like a lung may be punctured. He's low on fluid. Name of next of kin unknown. His pressure's nearly flat, pulse unstable. Now this guy should go straight in OR. He's barely breathing. And make sure we have a neurology resident standing by. - Come on, pack him! [beeping] What's happening? - Blood pressure's dropping very rapidly. Seems he bled out. - Pump some fluid in. Come on, Paul, you got to help with this thing too, pal. Let's have some fresh blood in here. - I have very little pressure. - Alright, alright. [rapid beeping] - I have no pressure. - Let's keep trying. [flatlining] - [Doctor] More sterile sponges. Help me control his bleeding. Sponge. Hang on, Paul. [hissing machines] - Doctor, he's gone. There are others waiting who need your attention. - Close him up, disconnect. - We'll have to leave him here for awhile. We're kinda busy outside. - Okay. - [Nurse] Okay, everybody who's not essential, get down to resuscitation. There's about four more in from the same accident. [sighs] Mary, will you call and get the coroner's papers? - Let's leave it for awhile. [bustling] - Alright, let's get her up to CCRU. - Dr. Cowley. - Yes? - I have to tell you I'm impressed. - I don't believe I heard what you said, sir. - I'm impressed. - Oh? I'm surprised. - I mean it. I don't mean I like you. - I'm not surprised. - I don't like you at all. You have no concept of cooperation. Your idea of teamwork is everybody does it your way. - Only if I'm right, sir. - But you're always right, Doctor. - When you can prove me wrong, Doctor, be my guest. - Out of the way, please, Dr. Cowley. - Nurse, what is it? - Smoke inhalation. - [Cowley] Alright, I'll go with you. - The morgue said they'd be right up with a bag for this one. Come on, let's go! You can bring the IV with you. [gagging, breathing] Aren't those guys from the morgue ever coming? - Dr. Cowley. - You're gonna be alright. Yeah? - CCRU is full. - Mm... Alright, curtain off part of the neuro wing, they have some empty beds. - What happened to your foot? Who'd you kick? - The director of nursing, now go. - Everybody back, right now, come on, move, move! - I don't know how, but he's still alive. - Don't ask me to explain. Let's just get on with it. I need blood, lots of blood, let's get him in here, quick. [bustling continues] [beeping] - Pulse is building. Getting stronger all the time. - If you make it Mr. Kehoe, one of us is going to have to buy the other a large drink or two... or three. - Kind of makes you wonder who's dead and who's alive. - I do believe you're gonna make it, Mr. Kehoe. - [Nurse] Isn't it incredible? - Do you know what just happened in there? - Sure, they saved him. - And I thought he was dead. Ah! After all this, look how much we don't know. - I only hope they hadn't told his family. - Ooh, I hope not too. You know, that's what we gotta do... find a better way to deal with the families to help them handle things like this. - And we've got to stop patients from dying in post-op. - Mm. And if we could get TV cameras in helicopters and ambulances, we could see... the injury. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. [laughs] Liz, um... why don't you see who I should take to lunch, huh? [laughs] [Cowley] If we can get to you, allow you to breathe, and to stop your bleeding, and restore your blood pressure within an hour of your accident, then we can probably save you. Now isn't that a golden hour? If we save an older person from cancer or heart disease, we can save only a few short years, maybe. But if we save a teenager from trauma, we save a whole lifetime.
