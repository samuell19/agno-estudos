You've been timed for 2 hours, so that's 4 dollars. - Who says so? - The clock! You know where you can stick your clock, sweetheart! Why don't you tell that to Mr Torvesi. Yes, why don't you tell me? Dumb son of a bitch! Cool it! Cool it, will you Torvesi... For a couple of lousy dollars? You're gonna end up paying for a nose job on that kid. What are you cops hanging around for? How many times did the Don tell you? Cops, you're all alike! You don't listen. Stay out of this place! I hate pigs, you hear? Cops! All the same. Always stealing money out of dead man's pockets. Torvesi's not afraid of no-one! Get that into your heads! And never forget it! Torvesi's got important friends! In places you never even dreamed of! Let's do something... we will work later. Yes... Listen, it looks like two of the Spezzano guys came from San Diego, to nose around. Put someone behind them, and keep me posted. Sure, Mr. Garofalo. And make it quiet. It's something I have to do myself as a boss. I'll see later, if it's something I should tell Don Antonio. Garofalo speaking... - Where's your brother? - He should be here about now. Ah, there he is... We got a contract, William Torvesi... You got nothing to say? We know it has to be done. He's one of the family. Only the syphilis has gone to his brain. He's talking his head off. Get your hands off me! You lousy stinkin' cops! You dirty bastards! They're from the fourth precinct, they'll take him there. That's where we'll get him. Look out! Hey old man... Get out of the way... Ok, now! Out of the way, you're blocking the traffic! Hey, you might hurt him like that... And what'll we tell the chief, huh? Maybe you better tell him to pick him up. We send him through the mail, he may get lost. Yeah, he wouldn't get further than dead letter office. They tried a few little tricks on us. But we got the canary, and they know he's gonna sing. What am I? What's with this get up? Get me out of this! Listen, you imbecile. Without that uniform, you wouldn't be shooting off your friggin' mouth! You're alive! Bless your patron saint, if you got one. Consider yourself fortunate to be enjoying our hospitality. You gonna charge me? Nah... what the hell for? Resisting arrest? Attempted homicide, assaulting a police officer, carrying concealed weapons? No no... We'd look real stupid if we had you up on anything so trivial, right? - So what do you want from me? - I'd like to... No, I got a splitting headache, sarge. You always said you had a lot of important friends, right? So lets talk about 'em... What friends? Don Antonio Macaluso. The job just couldn't be done, Don Antonio. Garofalo's boys only saw cops, come out of the wagon. And by the time they wised up, it was too late. What's Garofalo got to say? It was his responsibility. He's across the street. You wanna talk to him? No, I haven't much to say, Santino. Garofalo knows why Torvesi has to be eliminated. If he isn't, it's too bad for him, and it's too bad for everyone. No, no point in wasting words. What'd he say? You took the contract, Garofalo... Now it's up to you to see it through. Now, you wanna talk to the Don, he's up there. No, no, I wouldn't wanna disturb Don Antonio. Not for a bastard that fucks himself up. And puts me in the shithouse as well. Forget it, no use wasting words. That's exactly what the Don said... No use wasting words. - Well? - Torvesi wont talk. Alright you guys, lets make it snappy. And when you guys get in bed, keep it down. You got no time to fool around. - Hiya Maggie... - Hi sarge... - So, how's tricks, baby? - Could be worse... If I had an ass like yours, I'd be sitting in clover. Anytime you want a piece of it, it's on the house... I love cops... It was a very sloppy job. I wanted Torvesi to die, clean, painless... I told you that, didn't I? - Torvesi had done a lot for us. - That's right, Don Antonio... But they were gonna hand him over to the feds. I was lucky, I had a cop on my payroll. You should have used your brains, It would have worked out better. We could have kept this inside the family. You should have realised that Torvesi, god rest his soul... Was getting dangerous. You had the bowling alley under your control. He was your man... Like I said, he seemed alright... He was normal as anything until that day. How was I... how was anyone to know, what was gonna happen, Don Antonio Don Antonio said that you slipped up, Garofalo. Are you trying to scare me, goomba? No... no, no, Continenza is not trying to scare you. Nobody is trying to scare you. Don't get so upset... What can you tell me about these Spezzano men? No trouble yet, Manilli is watching them. These Spezzano brothers, are trying to stick their hands in our pockets. You know, if they're not careful... Cut 'em off... Ok... It's too bad Garofalo had to spoil my day. - Hey, Thomas gets out tomorrow. - Yeah, I know... - You know about the dinner? - Oh yes... I wanna feast... I want a feast, fit for a king... One last formality. Here are your personal effects. Yale is a fine law school... You'll want this back. - Well, I won't need it any more. - You never can tell, it might come in handy some day. Every lawyer gets accused at least once in his lifetime, of trying to bribe a juror. In your case, they happened to believe it, that's all. Sign here. Don Vito wants to see you before you go. And so... This day has finally arrived. - I'm sorry to be leaving you, Don Vito. - You're sorry to leave me? To keep me company, you want to stay here two more years? No, no... You're young, you have to live. Besides, you've seen that things are not too bad for me here. The warden's very understanding. - Remember me fondly, to Don Antonio. - Yes, of course. Today, he'll be so happy, you'll have to hold him down... You're more than a godson to him. He loves you like you were his own son. You don't forget... Yes, of course... If you need anything, my word still carries some weight. Thank you, Don Vito... Thomas... 14 years alone in here, I passed the time, I learned to read what's in a man's eye's. You're worried about something. Tell me the truth... Yes, I'm worried about something. Can I help? No, thank you, it's something I have to do on my own. Good luck... - How are you? - I'm fine, Don Antonio. Let me look at you. You look wonderful... - You look good too... - Thank you. Are you sure you haven't been at the Waldorf Astoria for the last two years? The Santa Fe Astoria... Well, this abstinence seems to agree with you... I remember you used to fool around so much. You were as pale as Saint Rosalia's candle. Ah Thomas... Now you can start it all over from scratch. You can have all the satisfaction you want. You can even go to the hospital to see that fink who accused you. They are still having trouble fixing his back, after that incident with the truck. It's just that... I'm not interested in that sort of satisfaction anymore... What are you talking about, you're not interested "in that sort of satisfaction." What do you mean? I don't know... Don Antonio... I don't think I can go to San Francisco with you... Where do you wanna go? I don't know... Somewhere else... What will you do? I'd like to try to lead another kind of life. Go back to university. Ah... Ah Thomas... Thomas, I know you had a lotta time to think, in prison... But you've got everything a man could ask for. You're respected, you're rich and powerful. You know everything that's mine, is yours. What do you mean, you want to try to lead another life, what do you mean? Well, to live like... Like millions of people live. To not have any cops on your back day and night, having to hide... I don't know, Don Antonio... This life is not for me anymore... I'm sorry... No matter where you go, it's the same. It's a struggle for survival. That's why you made it! All together, we can help each other. We're like coska, the leaves of the Artichoke. You leave now, the friends will look on you with suspicion, as though you had betrayed them. Nobody walks away, Thomas... Nobody important... A lawyer is an important man... But I know I could forget... There are many things, you could not forget... They're already forgotten, Don Antonio... I'm not sure... You know what you have to do... Tell Continenza to blow my head off, so you don't have to worry... I'm sorry... Come on... Let's go inside... Everyone's come down from San Francisco, to celebrate... We'll talk about it later... I prefer not to talk about it anymore, Don Antonio... We'll talk about it later! Oh... Don Antonio... Nice to see you... Thank you, I'm glad you could come. You always honor us by remembering your old friends... Well listen, you are men of respect... You know the young men today, they're different... Times have changed, we saw the families take shape... You know in Santa Monica 20 years ago, when Thomas's father was killed? Tom began at a meeting like this... Thank god, times have changed, Don Antonio... I'll never forget that night. It was the start of the big bloodbath... Hey sarge, I ain't seen you in Santa Fe in sometime... If I didn't have to drive all the way from Albuquerque, I sure as hell wouldn't. But duty calls, you know how it is... Hey, what's this? First we got the Chicano's and now we got the Italians, invading New Mexico... These are very special Italians, they got money growing out of their ears! Excuse me, I'll be right back... Sergeant thinks you got the wrong door. Maybe I don't have the wrong door at all... Oh really? Well let me inform you, that this room has been legally hired, for private use. In accordance with the laws and regulations of the state of New Mexico. Consequently, you don't have any right to be here without a warrant. - By the way, do you have one? - No... Well, I'm terribly sorry, but... You must go... Bravo Thomas, you were great... I've been missing my lawyer for quite a long time... As soon as you have a moment, I'd like to have your advice... Thomas is gonna have a little time off. He's gonna have a rest. That's a shame, I was counting on it... After spending 2 years lying around, I didn't think you'd need a rest... Well, it's not exactly a rest, it's more like a vacation... I mean, after 2 years, you need a break, before you go back to work, no? Thomas, where are you going? Florida, Mexico? - Thomas... - Yes? With Don Antonio, how did it go? Well... Does he know about us? Where we are... I haven't told him. But he knows... He always knows everything... Don't think about it anymore... We got some problems with some of these businesses. The ones in Thomas' name. The way things are set up right now, it's getting a little difficult to manoeuvre. Well, leave everything as it is. You think he'll be coming back? Sooner or later? No, I don't think so... He's an independent man. I just don't want him to have any financial worries. Whenever he wants his money, it'll be where he left it... If all this still stays on it's feet! I don't know, Santino, I don't know... You know, ever since we got back from Santa Fe, I've had a strange feeling... I don't know what it is... - You noticed anything? - Yes I have... But I wanted to wait till I was sure, before I said something to you about it. Look, I don't need a Consigliore who has to be sure, before he speaks up... Thomas's departure could be the storm, that starts the avalanche... I knew it was my own weakness, I knew it! What am I gonna do, kill my own son? Maybe somebody will take advantage of it, eh? And try and squeeze me out. Like Garofalo? Continenza? I saw him talking to a couple of Spezzano's boys, down at the bar, by the waterfront. You tell Continenza, I wanna see him tonight... You tell him that, wherever I go, I want Tony Minnelli, instead of Verandazzo, you understand? I should go to the cemetery, Minelli. It's my wife's saint day. Well, you go there every year. You wanna go? Yeah, let's go... Macaluso's finished! And you're gonna finish with him. He won't allow me to split off from the family, and be my own boss... But he just let that kid, Thomas, go off on his own. He would have killed anybody else. So now I'm gonna re-shuffle the deck. It's business, Continenza, business... News from the West Coast. It looks like a new mafia war has started. In San Francisco, two members of the Macaluso crime family, have been found, dead. Santino Greco and Luis Minnelli, two of the most important of Antonio Macaluso's men, were found today, shot to death. Antonio Macaluso, considered to be the head of the San Francisco rackets, has gone missing, after surviving the ambush. Another boss of Macaluso's family, Mike Continenza, is nowhere to be found. Vincent Garofalo, another boss of the family, denies any accusation of being the leader, of the going war... That Garofalo is a son of a bitch. Why do you care? What happens in San Francisco doesn't matter anymore. Don Antonio always matter, understand? Bad sign, if they don't answer the phone... - Ah Michele. - I'm glad to see you alive, Don Antonio. Thank you... - And thank you for the faith you've shown me. - Come on, come and sit down... - So? - The news are bad... Continenza is dead, so don't expect any help from his soldiers... They've gone in with Garofalo. He's running the war with the approval of the Spezzano family. - Did Spezzano send any men? - No, he's taking his time... All the family bosses in Chicago, Detroit New York, Miami, are waiting... In fact, they're giving Garofalo, a little help there... Of course they are... They know, once I'm eliminated, it'll be very easy... to liquidate Garofalo, and move into San Francisco. They only have one problem... I'm still alive... Ok... I've known some better days. But, I still have some powerful friends. Thank you. If I need you, I'll send for you... You must eat something, Don Antonio. - Excuse the intrusion, Terio. - What are you saying, Don Antonio... I owe everything to you... My American citizenship, my license... Yes, but you know you have family. You should be more careful... That's true, Don Antonio... But I am not afraid, believe me... Well, you've done me a great service by allowing me meet my friend here. Do me a service, eat! I cooked that personally. I cook with love... Take my wife, but don't touch my stove... Listen, you know where you can stick this, Mr Lawyer. Or is there something else you wanna tell us about the laws of New Mexico? No no no, I just wanna know one more thing... Considering I didn't throw the bomb at the child... Am I wrong, or according to the laws of New Mexico, you can't file any charges? Look, you dago! When an innocent little kid becomes a victim of your Mafioso warfare I can forget the law even exists, and I wanna kick you right outta here on your ass, see? Accardo is not a very popular name here, in Albuquerque... Any objections? No, I can't object to that... You're the boss, if you don't like me... One more word, one more... And you'll be leaving New Mexico, in an ambulance. - No drugs? - No drugs... - No weapons? - No weapons... By the way, will you wrap it up, or do I take it as it is? Take your choice... Yeah, sure... Well, sergeant don't really want to rush you... But when you have some time, you can put it back together, right? One last piece of advice, stay clear of San Francisco... The Macaluso family has fallen on hard times... Mr Smartass Lawyer... Thank you very much, sergeant... Laura, I have to go... So, what is Spezzano saying? We still have a deal, right? Sit down, sit down... He still supports me, and he sends me the men I need... Nothing has changed, right? It's alright, but the price is raising. You couldn't get rid of Antonio Macaluso and Thomas Accardo. With them alive, the game is way more dangerous... And what is the price, Dorsiello? The port business and the transport network, as we said earlier... Plus a percentage of your future profits... Spezzano has to make sure everybody knows I am the new head of the family. Everybody has to acknowledge that, understand? Here are your tickets... There's 2,000 dollars in the envelope. You stay with the 4 men from the Bolivian commerce delegation until they leave Washington... - It better work out, girls... - We'll keep them happy, Miss Dorothy I hope so... - Ok, I'll see you when you get back... shoo... - Bye, Miss Dorothy... It took a gang war, to remind you I exist... Just like old times, eh godfather? Old times are gone, Dorothy... Everything's changed... You don't have to tell me... You know what this is? It's the first 100 dollars, that I took in the old place on Howard Street, down by the docks... Oh what a place it was, it was 15 years ago... I know, it's a long time... This business doesn't change, there's no recession in your industry, is there? The clients are different... My girls are now called, hostesses, interpreters, private secretaries... It's prostitution, 1973 style... You know something, Dorothy, I don't like your girls... They all look the same, it's like you bought them at a supermarket... So, I'm the perfect one, that's why you like me... For me, you're still the most beautiful girl in San Francisco... Thank you... Another time, darling. I got a lot of things on my mind. Oh listen, I hope you don't mind... I made an appointment to meet somebody up here... What is it? A priest, say's he's got an appointment. Let him in... Ok, I'll leave you alone with your confessor... Listen, show him the way up here... I don't want him to go into the wrong room... Ok? I'll send him over here... - It's about your family vault. - I understand. Yes, and all the land that goes to the rectory. The parish is willing to buy everything... Yes, everything, the grave and the land. Of course, your beloved wife, may the lord bless her... would have a decent accommodation even if, less remarkable. So if your difficulties are also financial, maybe we can arrange it, Don Antonio. Well, that's very generous of you... Sure, the Macaluso tomb has always bothered the parishioners... I tell you what, father... As you know, I don't have any heirs. So, if I were to die, you could have the whole thing for nothing. But if I live, I want you to come back and see me, and offer me the same proposition. Is that clear? Thank you for coming, father... Hey Torrillo, Garofalo sends his regards... He'd like to thank you for the hospitality you showed Macaluso. You can't go in there, without being announced... Who are you? - Macaluso been here? - Yes, he was... Where did he go? He'd have to be stupid, to tell me, a thing like that... You can go to hell! He won't get away, not even with your help. Is that right? You'll see... But I don't think Don Antonio should be hunted down, like an animal... I remember when you started out, you were scared to death... Personally, I don't bear any grudge against, Antonio Macaluso... It wasn't me, who asked for this war... He was the one who forgot that nobody is allowed to split from the family. Ever! Not until they fall down dead! You mean because Thomas is breaking away? You shouldn't worry... Not today, but what about 5 or even 10 years from now? He failed the only father he had. A man who can do that, can do anything. When there's no way out, he'd kill you. If you were the boss, then you'd have to do something, no matter what. Even if he is a godson, he's involved. Otherwise, you can't expect any faith from nobody. So somebody else, has to be up on top! - Thomas! - Yes, it's me, Don Antonio, how are you? I'm Ok... I though maybe you forgot our emergency number... - How are you? - I'm fine, I'm in San Francisco... Don Antonio... May I be your Consigliore again? Right... Nice place, isn't it? I'm sorry about the mess I got you into, Don Antonio... Ah, forget it, what's done, is done. I just feel better knowing that you're safe, that's all. I was bothered, not knowing where you were. Waiting for the goddamn phone to ring... Listen, Thomas... I've had some second thoughts, about you being here, in San Francisco. Now I'll tell you what I want you to do... I want you to get out of here as soon as you can. Take your girl, and just go... I'll handle things here by myself. - No, we'll handle it... - Oh no no... Don Antonio, are we like the cosca or not? Yeah yeah... Listen Don Antonio, they tried to kill you. And Laura is alive by a miracle, because yesterday they threw a bomb at her house, and killed a 7 year old girl. And whoever did it, believe me, better cross himself. Son of a bitch! Then... Let me get to the point. Don Antonio, I just want to know where all this operating money is coming from. Because the Spezzano brothers just don't have that kind of money... So somebody here, is tied up in it... Yes, all the families got together, they're trying to make a deal... They're trying to make a deal? I've already sent word out, that I want peace... We already lost 18 men and no bodies... What did they do with their bodies? Oh, and the F.B.I's got all my money 9 bank accounts! All my strong boxes, they're all sealed up with wax. You can't even talk to those guys. I got money, you understand? I got money over there, not here. I dunno, 5,6,7 million dollars. Thomas, you know if this keeps up, I'm gonna have to hock my shoes to buy a toothbrush... What about... How did they get to your strong boxes? I used to send Garofalo, he knew where they were. And you want to talk about peace? I don't like being holed up like this, I tell you that. But what are we gonna do? Well, we'll make a big move, with a small army. How about that? Good, that's good... - We'll bring the ball game to them, huh? - Right... I don't like being holed up like this... Hey Mike, how you doing? - Can you get the gate for me please? - You got it... There's a package for you, in the back, grab it... The lesson to Garofalo, brought results. 7 dead, and 11 out of action. Twice as many as it says in the papers. Garofalo got rid of the bodies, so it wouldn't look so bad... And he told you he wanted to meet, and talk? The meeting will be held, according to usual rules... With me standing as negotiator, as gilt edged insurance. He said that a war like this, is harmful to everyone... Well, go on inside fellas, and have yourselves a drink... We'll talk in here... Don Michele... What do you think, Thomas? Well, I think it's a trap... - Don Michele? - I think he's, he's right... Thank you... I think we cannot afford, to miss this meeting... It'll give us some time to think about it. What do you say? Ok, tell them we accept. Meanwhile, we'll think about how we can stop the bastard from screwing us. I'd like to make you a proposition, Don Antonio... No one will search me. I've been acting as a negotiator for years now. And I'll take a gun with me to the meeting... If Garofalo tries anything, I'll pass it to you... Listen my friend... If things don't go well, you could be a dead man. I'd like to do it out of friendship, but I cant... - I want to talk about a deal. - Huh? What do you mean? Call it kind of insurance, Don Antonio. Life, insurance. I'm an old man, and I have a daughter, Rosalie. She isn't married, and she isn't in the best of health. She can't even work. One way or another, my time is near. I don't know how... how she'll manage without me. You've got to look after her, that's all. Why, you may ask? The truth is, I'm really poverty stricken. Why didn't you come to me before? It would be my privilege to help you, Don Michele, you know that. I would never have asked, I have my pride. Agreed... If things don't go well, and if I live... I'll take care of your daughter, but you must know that right now, I don't have any money. I have your word, Don Antonio. Don Michele... Ah, you didn't forget, did you... eh? You should have seen him 20 years ago talk of having a right hand man... He was always there, weren't you, eh? Don Antonio! You liked that, huh? You thought you'd get me, huh? You'll have to wake up earlier for that. - Hello... - Thomas? Yeah, speaking... - It's ready, I've taken every precaution. - Did you put the curtains up? Yes, that's done... Now listen, Don Michele, if there are any lampshades at all be sure to take them off, and leave the bare bulbs, ok? - I'll see to it immediately. - Ok... Listen, do you know what kind of a trick that son of a bitch is up to? - No, but we'll see tomorrow... - Ok... - Thomas... - Yes? - Be sure and tell Don Antonio. - Yes of course, Don Michele, ok... bye. Garofalo called this meeting, so it's up to you, to talk first... My ways, are the ways of reason, the ways of peace. - This war don't help nobody. - You just find that out? I was forced to do what I did. No offense meant, Don Antonio... But you did not act in the interests of the family. You allowed Thomas to break away from us... But you wouldn't allow me, to work on my own... I didn't, because I thought you weren't fit. No offense meant... Water under the bridge, Don Antonio. Thomas has returned... He's back with the family. So you make the conditions, Don Antonio. All we gotta do, is to divide the interests on the coast. There's room enough for everyone. And Don Antonio, we'll forget what blood has been spilt. So what's going on? Is this the annual reunion of the San Quentin graduates? I'm talking to you... So answer, when I ask you something I came out for a breath of fresh air... I bet not one of you has got a corkscrew on you... What's going on in there? A family meeting? So, what do you know, a séance! So what's up? Somebody get killed by mistake, and you've come to say you're sorry? No sergeant, this is a business meeting, this room has been booked and paid for. And as we are not breaking any laws, will you please get out! Yeah, sure... So you booked the room and paid for it. Don Michele! He's got 2 slugs in him. But he'll pull through, all right. Ok, some unidentified person tried to ambush you... They shot you, and killed your assistant. I saw the whole thing. They even tried to kill me. Ok, you'll get more this time than the Torvesi thing... That's a good thing. A sergeants pay ain't all that much. But it's understood, you gotta get those bastards. There's gotta be no witnesses. Rosalia, yes, it's me. I've had a great day. I've concluded a deal. From today on, you won't have to worry. Goodbye... my daughter. Ciao, Rosalia... You gotta match? They can't take it anymore, it's a matter of hours. Don't be so sure, Garofalo. Honestly, I won't bet on you, not even a dime... I set off hundreds of men, on every street... Double the men on the street, but find them. Don Antonio, that son of a bitch, is a magician, a transformist. He can walk safely in the Chinese neighbourhood and who knows. - He can walk unnoticed. - Listen to me. Don Antonio Macaluso is not done for. There are still many that trust him. This war is ruining everyone, and if you die, the war is over, don't forget. Thomas! Laura, I want to introduce you to Don Antonio Macaluso... Don Antonio, this is Laura Murchison... - Hello. - Hello, excuse the intrusion, Laura... - Please... - Thank you... Well, consigliori, from what you tell me, things are not going too well, huh? Some people think we have our backs to the wall. I don't think so... I think America is bigger than that. Right all the way across the ocean, to Sicily... What do you think about that? It's a good idea, it's a good, good idea... You'll be safe in Sicily. Don Antonio has many friends there, your father had many friends. Don Vito... What about your friends? My friends, you can count on them. I was hoping to hear you say that. Why didn't you tell me that you were leaving to go to Italy? What difference does it make, to Italy or anywhere else? Laura, I want you to lead a normal life. - Why don't you forget about me? - And give up everything? All I want is to be with you, I'll go anywhere... I'll do anything you want, you just have to say it... Maybe after everything is settled... - If you still want me... - I'll always want you... Thomas... Please tell your godfather... That if you're in love, it doesn't matter if your name is Murchesent, or Macaluso... You know Thomas, I grew up on these streets... Yes, I remember everything... Even though I left Sicily before the war, I went back a few times, on business. Yes, I remember everything... Now listen, and don't forget it! In San Francisco, if you get into trouble, there's always a way out. But here, you make the sign of the cross... understand? So... you think I've changed? I know you haven't changed, Antonio. That's why Garofalo must be a real stronzo, for doing what he's done... - The son of Giuseppe Accardo? - Yes, this is Thomaso, my godson... - I also, was your fathers godson... - Yes, I know... Here, you're with family... If you need anything, you have only to ask... All we need, are friends... Then you are alright, you have friends... You will be safe here in Politzi Genarosa. You have the word of Don Colloga La Vezza... Here, you can decide with calm, what you intend to do. Without being worried about this thing, with Vincenzo Garofalo... Business has been pretty good... Fortunately, Sicily has begun to wake up, after all these years. Oil refineries, hotels... And I invested the money you sent, with care. - The documents are here at your disposal. - Oh no, it's alright... Did you send the cheque to Don Michele's daughter? How much money do you think we can release, in a very short time? Considering all the participation, I think we can raise 20 million Lira... What's that in dollars? About 5 million, depends... The dollar has become something of a yoyo... And is it difficult, to transfer all that capital to America? Not too hard... So, you want to return to America right away? I finished with America 20 years ago, after your father was killed... - You remember Sicily? - Well enough, just watch the road... It's too tough, we're going back to Palermo. What for, Don Vincenzo? The sooner we get this over with, the better... That's where Macaluso and Accardo are holed up, ain't it? We couldn't even get a foot inside that place. We'd be butchered like chickens... We're not in San Francisco, you know... Here, Macaluso and Accardo are protected by everyone... Priests, nuns, beggars, children, whores, everyone... No no, we'll head back to Palermo... Hey Carlo! - Just a moment! - Hurry up! Empty his pockets, take out everything. - Lets get the hell outta here! - What if they find the body? They wont find it... And what if they do? No-one's gonna talk... This is Sicily... Use your stupid head! - This Nico Strollo, can he be trusted? - Garofalo says he can. Someone in the Spezzano family, gave us his name... - This is Nico Strollo... - How are you? Where's Mike? He's over there, looking for a place to take a leak. And so, Garofalo took a flight out of Palermo, Next stop, New York... Good Sicilian wine... If I were you, I'd let him go. Spezzano will settle accounts with him. What do you say, huh? I mean, what's San Francisco got over Palermo? You know here, we're amongst real friends... What are we missing? Well, I think, as long as Don Garofalo is alive... We're missing a hell of a lot Don Antonio... Thomas... You know this Garofalo, thing... This is a family affair, It takes organization. I don't want you to turn this into your own personal vendetta. Do you understand? Don Antonio... That's the way I am... I know that's the way you are. I know that! What do you think I sent you to school for? Why do you think, I changed your surroundings? If I'd been any stronger, I'd have kept you out of the family, in the first place. Just leave things alone... Come on, lets go inside, it's cold... Vincenzo Garofalo! Don Antonio! Let's get outta here... Well... Imbeciles... Imbeciles! - It's done now, eh Thomas, huh? - Yeah... Dumb bastard! I think we gotta do a lot of thinking... I dunno, a lot of... Re-organization... We got some important decisions to make. We stay here... Go back to America, understand? I don't know... I don't know... Take our time... Dumb bastard! That's it finished... Everything is settled... Well, what are you gonna do? Business is business... Thomas... Thomas... Are you alright? Answer me! Why didn't you say something? I'm Gaspare Rico, Don Antonio... I've come from New York. The families would be honored if you'd return to San Francisco, Don Antonio... Everyone in California, is waiting for you. And, they sent him this... Someone is sleeping, at the bottom of the ocean. Yes, the sergeant... The sergeant of the San Francisco police force... - I kiss your hands, Don Antonio. - Regards, Geraci... Do you remember me? I remember everything. Unfortunately...
