I don't know, and I don't want to know. That's something that concerns you. [man] If I'd known you were here, I'd have come sooner. [Lallo] There's a woman with style. [Flavia] Go on, I'm here to learn. I'm unfaithful to her.Shall we be on our way? I leave her, and she withdraws in silence with real dignity. More than dignity-- it's a question of habit. You see? You're no lady. I'll punish you. No, Lallo! And can I ask you what you're going to do with all this money? Of course, sure you can. It's your money. Well, what are you going to do with it? I want to give Ida a present. And, after all, it's only fair that you should... [kiss] pay for it. [woman] Yes? Mrs. Vermasconi, please. You can't go in, sir. Excuse me, please. [hairdryers humming] Look. Tell me what you think of it. Filipo, just a second, please. I don't know what you have to say to me, and I'm not interested, especially here in front of all these people I know. Why don't you open it? It's awful. Of course, it was very expensive. Frightful. You don't think it's beautiful? I didn't make a good choice? Well, of course, it depends on the person you had in mind. Whom did you buy it for? It's for you. I want to give you a present. I want you to have something from me. Now you get around to it, now that everything is finished between us. It's not very clever.Why? Because, if I wanted to make trouble for you, I could go to your friend, Flavia, and say, "Look, darling, what Lallo gave me today." Oh, she already knows. What? I asked her to give me the money especially. "I want to give Ida a present," is what I told her. You're mad-- out of your mind! Did you think you could get rid of me with a bag? No, pretty boy. In that case, it would take much more. Go away, get out! I don't ever want to see you again! To hell with your pride! I'm through! I've had enough! [woman vocalizing] Would you like this bag? I'll make you a present of it. I beg your pardon?Take it. It'll make me very happy. I don't understand. What's your name? You know, I can never remember it. This is for you. All right, if you want. Has anyone called? Yes, Mrs. Vermasconi called twice. She asked you to call her back. All right, thank you. [dialing phone] [phone ringing] Hello? Flavia, at last I found you. I've already called you several times. I know. Has something happened? Lallo-- he came to the hairdresser's, just like that. All of a sudden, he wanted to give me a bag. Well, what did you do? I refused it, of course. How did he know you were there? I really don't know, Flavia. He must've called my place. How do I know what goes on in that head of his? To disappear the way you did, without making a scene. After all, that would've been very natural. Now he does nothing but irritate the hell out of me, "Ida here, Ida, there. What class, what style." I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I help you get rid of him, and to repay me, you want to pass yourself off as the heroine, who withdraws nobly and suffers silently, and you're-- Now, Flavia, you're not being fair. I was quite satisfied with Lallo, but when I saw you liked him-- All right, I don't want to talk about him anymore! But, apart from that, it seems that things are going rather well between you two. Oh, I like him well enough. But you were right, he's very expensive. Bebe-- like father, like son. Just imagine how much Bebe must've cost Giuditta. [laughing] You know, with shampoo, perfume, creams, and what have you, he would do nothing but moisten himself up from morning till night. [laughing] Flavia, if you'd fallen in love with Lallo, I would've never forgiven myself. What? Me, in love with Lallo? Oh, it's all very pleasant, but the day things change, I go one way, he another, and we'll stay friends as before. Oh, by the way, I spoke to daddy about your husband, and he's sure he can find a place for him. See you at the ball tonight. I've ordered a Cossack's uniform for Lallo. Take care. Bye, darling. Bye. ♪♪ Why aren't you wearing your costume? Now, go upstairs and change right away. At least you could tell me why you didn't wear it. You liked it so much. Oh, poor darling. The cat got your tongue? Are you in a bad mood? Okay, let's go! [Flavia] You haven't even told me if you like my costume. Don't you think that it's a better idea than a mask? More modern, more unusual. Don't tell me that its meaning bothers you? Why, Lallo, that wouldn't be like you at all. [laughing] Could you have Catholic scruples? There's nothing more in fashion these days than desecration. That doesn't interest you either. Let's see if I can guess. You're tired of staying in Cortina. Too much to drink last night.
