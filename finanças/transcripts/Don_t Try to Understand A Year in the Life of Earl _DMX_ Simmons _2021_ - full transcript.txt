(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) This film is a portrait of Earl "DMX" Simmons through a very tumultuous year. A year right before he passed away.

(EXODUS BABBLES) DESIREE: He's a good father to Exodus. Very, like, he just loved that little boy. Exodus is the same way, like, if he'd have to choose between me and Earl, he'd probably choose Earl.

Well, it's an exclusive recording agreement. -EARL: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. -BEZILLA: I'm sure you know what that is. The initial period is, there's one album plus one holiday album, and that determines your recording funds -for future albums. -(EXODUS BABBLES) BEZILLA: Uh, the payment schedule... -uh, for that is... -Gimme. BEZILLA: ...upon, you know, promptly following signature. Actually it's called a min-max formula, the minimum-maximum. -So you're getting-- -That's so good.

BEZILLA: (CLEARING THROAT) Mm-hmm. That's right. -Cool? -Sounds good. -All right. -BEZILLA: Any questions? -Nope. -I think we're ready to go. PAUL ROSENBERG: One of the things that is important to me was to reconnect with a lot of the heritage artists from Def Jam. A lot of which, you know, weren't here anymore. MAN: Right. I never imagined that I'd have the opportunity to reengage with somebody on the level that I've reengaged like we have with DMX. You know, he's just one of the most important artists in hip-hop history, period. But to this label, he was such a part of its success, and the culture surrounding it. -(LAUGHS) -(LAUGHS) -All right, man. Just beginning. -Yeah. Yeah. PAUL: I mean the plan is, we just can't mess it up, man. We've got a real opportunity here to reintroduce him. You know, he's always been DMX. He's not gonna come out as something that's completely reinvented. But I want the current version of him and his music -to be as powerful as can be. -EARL: Thank you very much. I need to talk to you for five minutes. All right. STEVE: So, Bruce will walk us through everything. BRUCE: So, as you know, this is all preliminary. There's nothing locked here. TIM: Let's just talk about some of the various situations. You know, I think this is a good opportunity. So, let's just talk about the here and the now. We'll get you the five. X will get the 550 in hopefully the next two weeks. Now it's not all getting paid to X, it's getting paid... EARL: Everyone but X. TIM: Part of it's goin' to your ex-wife. Then we've got a booking agent that has a judgment. This thing is probably upwards of 300 grand. City Marshall in Rosedale, New York. Their judgment was 186,000 dollars. -MAN: For what? -TIM: I don't know. EARL: All right, will we pay off a bunch of random people that just, you know, got a default judgment because I didn't show up for a court case I didn't even know I had. -DESIREE: Wanna wait for the next one? -EARL: Yeah, we'll wait. -This was supposed to be fun. -I know. All these fuckin' people stealin'. All these fuckin' fake ass judgments and shit, man. Greedy ass fuckin' bitches. I just wanted turkey on a roll. Just some turkey on a roll. We are done. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) DOCTOR: I was reminding Mom about this when you guys came to see me in the office when she was pregnant. People were talking to you about kidney failure, right? They were talking to you about transplant. Lots of bladder surgeries, right? Guess what he hasn't had in the last three years. -None of those things. Okay? -EARL: All right. DOCTOR: Now, the reason for that is because of her. Okay? She's been doing the cathine, we've been doing the Ditropan, or the Oxybutynin. And his bladder has sort of stretched out. So that's a wonderful thing. But at the very end... look at your son, right? This is not what you were told when you were pregnant. -DESIREE: Right. -DOCTOR: Okay? I already knew that my son was gonna be all right. -EARL: Oh, yeah? -Yeah, it's enough. Yeah, that's my baby. I don't work for a reason. (LAUGHS) -Thank you. -All right. INTERVIEWER: How you feel about how that went? EARL: That went good. That went really, really good. God is great. 'Cause when she was first pregnant... it was like, "You know, you can get pregnant again." -INTERVIEWER: Yeah. -This implying that, you know? -It wasn't gonna work out well. -Right. Yeah. Yeah, it worked out. It was all about God from the beginning. I was like, you know what? As long as he's fighting, you know what I'm saying? You know, we gonna fight with him. We gonna fight with him. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) Make a right at the light. On this corner. Yeah. It's my family's store. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) EARL: Yeah, what up? These niggas.

I have this principal that I live by. Expose the places... that scare you most. Expose them, and go towards them. That is where you will grow the most. Several years ago, we were all on the Iyanla show, Fix My Life. My heart had been so hardened. It was clenched. IYANLA VANZANT: Ask what you want now. A relationship. A healthy relationship with you. Can we have that? Yeah, I mean, that's what I've... -Clean, completely clean. -What do you mean? You. That's what you're asking me for? XAVIER: My father's decisions broke my heart.

(MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) So Pat's still asleep. You niggas will wake me up if I gotta get on fuckin' stage. Like, if we know we going to these different cities, I don't know why it's not already taken care of. At least we know where we're going. SPANK: This is a brutal industry. Sometimes, life could be just as cold. Somebody asks me, they see me. I'm going through a whole lot of shit. "Hey, you all right?" "Yeah, man, I'm good. I'm good." You know what I'm saying? Lyin'. Knowing I ain't good. So, you know, that's what I mean... about pain. You know, hide the pain or whatever it is that really is the root to all of everything else that you're doing. You wearin' a mask now. Like even in the penitentiary like you saying or being in solitary in those kind of situations, right? You know, in my time, some people might think, "Come out, I'm all right. I'm the same dude I was when I went in." Or this or that. But I think the more it happens, the more it takes its toll on you. You come back, you not necessarily the same person. INTERVIEWER: What does "free" mean to you? You just came out after being in for a year. I'm still not free. I'm still not free. I'm still not free. You know, if I can't do what I'm supposed to do, what I wanna do, then I'd die anyway. (EXODUS CRYING) Exodus! Come here. Come here.

You know, you was in Bali last month, and Egypt before that, like, travelin' the world on my dime. Know what I mean, what is you pressin' me for? Like you ain't got no money, like the kids are hungry. Gotta get the exclusive, let me go ahead and get this. The family portrait here. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) -ANGELA YEE: We have Tashera Simmons. -COHOST: Yes, DMX's ex-wife. EARL: Hey, you know what I'm saying, all the big ballers? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) ANGELA YEE: And most recently, I heard that times were really hard for you, and that he wasn't helping you -or his family out at all. -Not at all. EARL: The Jay-Z Jehovah. -Yeah. -EARL: You know what I'm saying? I mean, a thousand dollars would be nice. Like nothing? And then, after him coming, and not only here, but other places, saying I'm money hungry? I'm like, we been together ten years before you got famous. And I'm the one who always held it down. But I know that we'd still be together to this day if it wasn't for the drugs. DESIREE: I don't wanna talk to you in front of the camera.

Yo, go back to DMX. Hey, yo! -Yo, check one two. -(ALL LAUGH) EARL: I work on my shit, and think about my shit the way I do. So, I don't give nobody no bullshit. I ain't never gonna give a nigga bullshit. Before I do that, I'll stop writing. But I'm at the point right now where I... Yo, fuck the world. I'm good. Not 'cause I'm doing like that, but because I'm hurt. INTERVIEWER: Do you think you're angry? I'm very fuckin' angry. INTERVIEWER: When are you at your angriest? Oh, man. Not being treated right from day one. I mean, as far as the system in general. INTERVIEWER: Both of your parents living? Uh... Yeah. INTERVIEWER: Were they supportive -during your childhood? -No. I remember a lot about my childhood. (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) I used to get beaten a lot. Lot of beatings. INTERVIEWER: And what about your mother, what was she like? WOMAN: It's awful. I'm trying to word it properly, 'cause you know what I'm saying? She is my mother, I don't wanna disrespect her. and you know, there's a lot of people in here, but... I'll just put it like this. There's no love. Yeah. It's like that. She like, beat me so much. She used to beat me until she was tired. You know, she'd always threaten us with, you know, "The white people are gonna come take you away. You want that?" Then gives me away anyway, you know what I'm saying? I was seven and I got put in institutions. I think... I think that's... you know, when the problem was born. -CROWD: DMX! DMX! DMX! -DMX! Come on.

(CROWD CHEERING) EARL: This next song... is for God's warriors. You might not know or think that you're special to God because you've been through difficult situations. (CHEERING) But I'm here to tell you... that's why you're special to God. Because it's when you go through somethin', that God is able to reach out, and help you through it. If you don't fall down, then God can't pick you up. Because it's during these hard times that you become aware of what God is willing to do for you. (CHEERING) -FAN: Love you, man. -Love you. It's fucking dope. That shit rub off, man. So, this is for all of those warriors. All of those people that have been through something.

What's your name brother? -ROGER BURTON: Roger Burton, man. -Good to meet you. And just the vibe you get here. ROGER: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nice to meet all you guys. What's your name? JASON HONECKER: For most of our kids that come here, they're here because something happened to them. It's not because they're bad kids. It's not because that, you know, they don't want to do good. It's because something happened to them along the line which brought them to a place like this. -Nigel, how you feeling? -I feel happy. -What's your goal? -To stay safe. -Who can help you? -Anyone. ALL: We'll help you. -NIGEL: Devin, how you feeling? -DEVIN: Confused. Can you ask him? -DEVIN: How you feeling? -Joyful. -DEVIN: What's your goal? -My goal is to... be an inspiration to someone that I don't know. DEVIN: Who you can help you? Anyone that can. -ALL: We'll help you. -EARL: Thank you. You're confused about why they ask you to come down here. All right, so I used to be here, as a resident. Long time ago, long time ago. And since then, I've made a career out of doing music... and movies. And I wanted to come back, and see what the place is like now that I've gone, and hopefully be an inspiration to some of the kids that are here now. They used to have the swings down there. I remember I would swing so high and then jump off. (LAUGHS) Jump, and it felt like I was flyin' for, like, a second and a half. Wow. This still looks the same. You know, a lot of kids come from situations that are a lot worse than this, you know, home life. You know, I mean, I wasn't eating three meals a day. I didn't have clothes freely given to me whenever I needed 'em. You know, I wasn't given an allowance. But, you know, I got all that here. -Yeah. -JASON: Come on in. -Instant memories. -JASON: Wow. Water still tastes the same. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) EARL: How you doing? -What up? -BOY: What up? You all right? -You all residents? -ALL: Yeah! EARL: Wow. Good place to be, man. Good place to be.

I was like-- You want some more? Yeah. I'm so glad you came. To get to the dressing room, and the one person that's in here... -my Paige. -(LAUGHS) PAIGE: It feels great to see my dad. I haven't seen him in quite some time, due to some troubles. But I'm glad to be back in his presence. You know, it's good to see him. And I always think it's dope for him to include God, so... INTERVIEWER: So, you're doing Sunday Service tomorrow with Kanye, you know? And I know you've been a man of faith for so long, like... what, if anything, does this mean to you? What does it mean? It means an opportunity. -INTERVIEWER: All right. -That's it. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) EARL: Do I think it's church? I think it's a celebration of what church can bring. Minus the reason why people actually go to church. Which is the Word. It's serving a purpose. God will use the devil for his purpose. (PEOPLE CHEERING, APPLAUDING) EARL: In the name of Jesus, let us pray. (CHOIR HARMONZIING) Father, please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good. May we be heard and understood. From the suburbs to the hood. And may you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes. See that we get our breakthrough, however long that it takes. May you fill that part of our souls, and lay our sins to rest. For there's no way we can live with Jesus when we're living in the flesh. So I pray that you allow our spirits to be born, grow strong, move on, to know right from wrong. First John, chapter two, verse fifteen. You do not love the world and anything in the world. Lord, you take care of fools and babies. You teach women to honor their men and men to respect their ladies. So, thank you! For preventing us from going astray. Doing wrong for so long that we forgot the way. (CROWD CHEERING, APPLAUDING) -This man is a Christian. -EARL: That's right. I knew it. I knew it. I could feel it in my spirit. WOMAN: Way to represent. And I get one this way. Yeah, that way I get more of it. WOMAN: Are you here for the festival? Are you playing? EARL: Yes, I'm actually on tour, but I did do a couple appearances at the festival. Coachella, in between dates. You did, wow. I've never heard you perform actually. Well, I was here last night. Well, actually I was in Anaheim last night and came back here to do the Sunday Service with Kanye. Oh, you did the Sunday service with Kanye. Wow, awesome. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.

JENN: I don't know what's goin' on. CLARK: All right, well, we're gonna wait as long as we can, 'cause we got everybody here, and it's like a really, really expensive day for us. We have to make it happen today. JENN: If you don't hear from him, I'd say about like 6:00... um, we might have to figure somethin' else out. (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) AUTOMATED VOICE: You have reached the voicemail box of-- (PHONE HANGS UP) CHRISTOPHER FRIERSON: We got a text from Pat, finally.

DESIREE: (PHONE RINGING) -CLARK: Yeah. -PAT: Yo, tonight was a disaster, bro, like... I don't know if you've dealt with anybody that does that drug, bro. But it's nasty. Like, it's dangerous. He was up for, like, four days. Cooped up in his house. Just... He's not a criminal, he's an addict. You know, he needs help. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) UNCLE BUCKEYE: Okay, this is raveen. This is where he sneaked down and he would buy his crack, so I used to come on, get up, you know, come outta the store, come on down and say, "Yo man, what the fuck, man? You don't know who's watching this, and you're just, you know, getting your shit right. Come on, get outta here." And I'd pull him out the hallway, he'd sober up. Then he would vanish. Then you don't see him, then you don't see Earl in about three or four weeks. You know, he would just vanish. He's been the same dude his whole life. And that's why it's hard for him to change because he is the same dude. He ain't ever shy away from the truth. He always speak the truth. He always let it be known, you know what I mean? He's fighting demons. -He's human. -He's like us. -Ain't no downhill. -Ain't no downhill, man. 'Cause you bounce back. -Yeah, you bounce back. -MAN: And he always do bounce back.

And he has. -Where you going? -My grandchildren had an order. Okay. So, you actually dress up for court. -Yeah. -Yeah, right. Who does that? -Who does that? -Right. JENNA: When he first came here, it was like, "Oh, no, no. I don't want to go to group," you know what I mean? And then slowly it was like, "All right, I'll try this group." -"All right, I'll come here at this time." -MAN: Right. And even, like, coming here, on his own every day. We're not driving him, we're not pickin' him up. -MAN: Right. -JENNA: He's coming here on his own. EARL: "I've been stabbed in the back by those I needed the most. I've been lied to by those I loved. And I felt alone when I couldn't afford to be. But at the end of the day, I had to learn to be on my own, to be my own best friend.

(EXCLAIMING, LAUGHING) I'm saying, the drugs were a symptom of another problem. Of a deeper, rooted, you know what I mean? So, you feel like you making some progress with that? One on one. You digging deep? EARL: Like the past couple of months before I even relapsed, I was like, "Yo, I need to talk to somebody." It's just the constant associating, you know, drugs and alcohol with having a good time. You know what I'm saying? This is real. We're having a session, okay? -(LAUGHS) -(LAUGHS) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) That was crazy. We're gonna try the other ones too. -Girl, that's-- I love this. -PAIGE: That's a good picture compared to our kids' one. EARL: We're here, we're healthy.

You stayed on that highway. -You stayed on that highway. -XAVIER: I did. -You stayed on that highway. -(SOBS) (SNIFFLES) EARL: It's all right. It's all right. At the end of the day, -we're still here. -Yes. EARL: We're still here. There's so much that we've lost. We're still here. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) You're my family. -XAVIER: You at... -EARL: Yeah. TASHERA: I gotta give Earl a hug! You gonna go over there and go have a moment with your family, nigga! I was like, "You mean y'all gonna go do this shit when I'm on camera?" As much as you pushed for this, as hard as you worked to get us to that point, -and you missed it. -Thank you, love. I love you too, baby. TASHERA: It's fun having kids, I swear. -MAN: Where did you guys first meet? -In Yonkers. MAN: And you guys were together for how long? So, we was together from our 18 till... So, what is that, 20 something years? All his handwriting. If you'll notice, we separated in '06, and that's exactly where it stops. -(EARL LAUGHING) -(LAUGHS) EARL: It was kinda sad to go, man. -TASHERA: Really? -I guess when I was leaving, they were just telling me, like, you know, how much it meant for me to be there. I inspire some people. That's when it hits you though, you know what I'm saying? -Yeah. You're leaving. -EARL: When you walkin' out, like "Yo, I did it." Let me leave, and then, like, we're gonna miss you, man. You gotta know when to put it in and how much to put it in. There's just something about it. There's a way you gotta do it. -Damn. (LAUGHS) -(LAUGHS) EARL: (LAUGHING) That is... -That's a big-ass claw. -Oh, it's a huge claw. -Little hot. It's a little hot. -GIRL: Did it to me too. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) -EARL: What you talking about? -GIRL: Here. EARL: He wrote the plan, it's his plan. He knows what's gonna happen. So, whatever little things happen in between, they've been accounted for. And look at what it comes down to. Family, friends.

(SINGING) Can it be It was all so simple then Or has time Rewritten every line And if we had the chance To do it all again Tell me... I got it. I'll do that, I'll do that. Just have a moment right now. This is a beautiful song. Memories Like the corners of my mind (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Misty watercolor memories Nothing like it. - Of the way it was - Of the way it was - Scattered pictures - Scattered pictures Of the smiles we left behind Smiles we gave To one another - For the way we were - For the way we were - Oh - Oh Can it be that It was all so simple then? Or has time Rewritten every line And if we had the chance To do it all again Tell me, would we? Could we?
