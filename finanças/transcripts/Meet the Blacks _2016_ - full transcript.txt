Hey, guys. Tonight is the Purge, and I want all of my white friends to be safe. Rules of the Purge... you have 12 hours to do any crime you want against anyone you want. You can shoot, kill, stab... Twelve hours of death, mayhem. Lock your doors. Protect yourself. Make sure your rent is paid and all of your pets are put up. But the most important rule of all... stay tight, stay white, and this is only gonna last one night. Let the games begin. ( Sneakers squeaking ) ( ball passes through net, audience cheers ) Man: All right, I wasn't gonna do this, but forget it. Here goes nothing. This is a story about the worst day of my life. - ( gun fires ) - ( chuckles ) Well, one of them. See, I was wiring shit... car stereos, alarms, you name it. Don't Hate Wiring, that's my company. And that's me, Carl Black. You see this ugly cat right here? That's Key Flo, a big-time drug dealer. One day while working on his alarm, Key Flo got busted. They took his ass far away. Mm. What they didn't know was in his house was a lot of money. So I took it as a payment for all the work I did. With a payday like this, it was time to move. Well, I did owe a few people in Chicago a few things, but no one's tripping. - ( chuckles ) - ( guns fire ) ( chainsaw whirs ) So I loaded up the family and got the hell out of Chicago. ( tires screeching ) Leaving Chicago before the Purge was the greatest thing I ever done. ( gun fires ) I met this cool dude on the Internet who helped us qualify for this big-ass house in Beverly Hills. I might've falsified a few things, but, hey, this is for my family. Those are my kids. My son Carl Jr. thinks he's a damn vampire. Think again, buddy. And this dummy with this do-rag? That's my little cousin Cronut. He went to jail for some parking tickets, and now he think he's a gangster. Cronut: Ride my mustache. Carl: That's my beautiful wife. Mm. Did I mention the greatest thing about my move? Rich people don't purge. Getting the hell out of Chicago was the best thing ever. Well, here's how the worst day started. ( horn honks ) - ( tires screeching ) - Man: Hey, come on, man! ( muffled music playing ) Hey, how you doing, sir? - You lost? - I beg your pardon? Man, you gotta be. Check this out... go right down here, make a U-turn, then you can pull right out, and you'll get back to wherever it is you need to get to. - I live here. - No. No, I'm serious, man. I live right there at Cherry Blossom. - I'm Carl Black. - Black? You said Carl Black? I just moved from Chicago. Man, listen, I'm gonna be real with you, man. Don't no niggas live here, man. I'm the nigga that living here! I'm the new nigga that living here, all right? Save me some trouble, man. We've been having all these break-ins and the rappers dance... loud mus... rims. Come on, man. Look at you, man. You can't live here, man. Go on and make... Don't fucking try to play me like this! - ( Shouting ) - ( horn honking ) I live here! I'm fucking crazy! Look at my eye right here. - Forest Whitaker eye. - Okay, you're right. I see. I found it. I found it. You're right. Carl Black. Right here. Carl Black. - You said I can go? - My bad, man. Oh, thank you, brother. Have a nice day, man. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Bitch. ( Tires screeching ) ( phone rings ) Woman: Please don't tell me your ass is in California. Don't call my phone no more. You told me you were going to the store! - I'm married now. - You're married? You keep blowing up... look, you pissing me off to the highest of "pisstivity." "Pisstivity" ain't even a word, dumb-ass. Shoranda, I don't wanna be over at your house with all them kids over there smelling like urine. I know you didn't just say that about my kids. - ( phone beeps off ) - ♪ You're fucking With a fly bitch ♪ ♪ Fly shit Too fly to be a side bitch ♪ ♪ Front of me I'm like, "Bye, bitch" ♪ ( music continues ) You bitch, nigga! Come out! Come to me! Everybody is gonna come in your house, they're gonna fuck you! I've traveled a long way to find you. - ( Horn honks ) - Hey! Caesar! Don't try to play me. You're Carl Black from Chicago, right? Yeah, and you're Caesar from The Planet of the Apes, right? Do I look like a fucking joke to you? - Yeah. - Consider yourself served. Hey, man! Don't hit me with no... don't do that! Don't do that. You're harassing me. You're at my mansion. I'm in Beverly Hills. No, don't... don't do that. If you didn't do nothing wrong, if you was a perfect human being, none of this shit would happen. - I wouldn't have to be here. - I ain't did nothing wrong! You're racial profiling me! You're too black to profile another black person. - What's wrong? - The fuck you mean, "Do I think you're black"? Look at me and look at you! - We are both black people. - You are black as fuck. What the fuck? Don't say that. Don't put that Ebola finger in my face. - No... - Look at your feet. What the fuck is wrong with my feet? You think this shit is a game? You fucking redbone bitch, don't ever disrespect my feet like that again. - I'm not disrespecting you. - Yes, you are, and it's because of your company, that Don't Hate Wiring, that has destroyed the best restaurant... - No, don't... don't... - Not just restaurant... African restaurant in the city of Chicago! Who else have you fucked up? I done wired all these different houses. I'm from the hood. I made it out of there. We wired Bishop Tutu's hut. We wired, uh, Idi Amin's bathroom. So get on out of here, man. You're very disrespectful. - Well, you bitch nigga. - No, you're a bitch nigga. And whatever container you came in and whatever trunk they smuggled your black ass in, take your ass back. Hey, who are you talking to? - Bitch. - Hey! - Don't touch! - Throw them keys again.

Ain't nothing you can do with no $100. - Once the Purge comes... - Carl, cash, money! Just pay her the $100, please, baby. - $100. Let me handle this. - Ming. Ming, listen to me. Pay me cash! I told you that I was gonna pay you in credit. Credit is king in America, okay? Pay me in cash, or I purge your ass tonight, bitch. - Come on. See, you done disrespecting me. - What the hell? - Just pay her. - ( screaming ) - You said you were rich. - I tried to give you a chance, but you disrespected me. Get your ass out of here, both of y'all. Man: I'm gonna fuck your wife! I'm gonna crush her pussy! Back up, Wesley Snipes and his new wife. What? Who is that African man? Wesley Snipes. He just got out of jail. You didn't hear... - Carl. - I ain't gotta play. - Baby. - Stop. Come on. Don't do that. I can't do it. - Come on. - Can't do what? - What is the deal? - Who was that man? ( Stammering ) I don't know who they was. They's people from my past, okay? It wasn't Wesley Snipes, though. I mean, he was black as hell like him, - but it wasn't him. - Carl, the only thing I need to know from you right now... - Uh-huh. - I swear you better not lie. - Do we have this money? - We got the money. Look, your ass is standing in a big-ass mansion. I bought you a brand-new car. What the hell? What are you worried about? I'm worried about how you got it. What did you do to get it? Okay, what did I do? I... I did a little dancing in Atlanta. Male gigoloing. Did something strange for a little piece of change. No. No, for real. Look, I got a chain of Wing and Things that I landed. That's what I'm doing. I'm going around hooking up wiring all over from here to San Diego. Baby, I want to believe you, but I can't keep uprooting this family - in the middle of the night again. - ( sighs ) I can't do that, okay? These kids need to trust me. They need to believe that we're in a family, that we're a unit, that they're secure. - I don't feel that right now. - Babe, the kids do trust you. They hate me, Carl. The kids don't hate you. No, they don't. You guys just need to get to know each other a little bit. - I'm trying. - And I know that you're getting upset. It's irritating you to see little Carl Jr. Running around here with a little Batman outfit with his little ass cheeks cut out. - It's a vampire. - Okay, a vampire outfit. And Allie's running around with Mr. Frosty, - whoever the fuck he is. - His name is Freeze. Yeah, I'ma freeze his ass. That's what I'ma do. Please trust me on this. - I have trusted you. - Well, keep trusting me, then. We got the Wings and Things, we got the house, we got the car. Look, let's enjoy this. - You living the life. - Okay.

So tonight, as Americans, - we purge. - ( crow caws ) Hey, if you ain't done nothing wrong, you got nothing to worry about. Purge ain't about you. It's about the rest of you.

What the fuck is this? I was trying to change the oil, man, but the oil's so gooky and shit, it's like dried-up nut. I can't do that. I don't need no little shade tree mechanic running around here. If you don't know what you're doing, take my shit to Midas. I do know what I'm doing. It's made me come up with great ideas. - A great idea like what? - A million-dollar idea. - A million-dollar idea? - Yeah. - With brand-new SUV? - Brand-new? It was brand-new when civil rights movement was going on. It's a one owner. One... one owner? Who was the one owner, Jesus? Nah, man! A white lady had it in her garage - and never drove it. - Was it Driving Miss Daisy? What's that little bolt right there? - Which one? - Goddamn mouth. - What's with you, bro? - Talking about my shit ain't brand-new. - Man, you need counseling, bro. - You do, too. No, I don't. You do, man. 'Cause I got great ideas. I'm trying to help you out, make this situation better for both of us 'cause I got this great idea. Let me tell you about it, man. All right, hear me out, bro. Here's what I'm thinking. These models are notorious for having electrical problems that start fire. So what I'm thinking is speeding up the process. - Mm-hmm. - That way, this bitch explodes, - you feel what I'm saying? - Yeah. If it explodes, - we get a new model, and a big settlement. - Wow. And if I get a big settlement, boom! So you think you're gonna get a settlement for blowing up in this truck? - If I'm in it. - You're gonna blow up? I'm not gonna blow all the way up. I'm not gonna die, that'd be stupid. All I'm gonna do is just burn my whole front of my body. Like... like you know how Kunta Kinte's back is? That's how the front of my chest's gonna look... Dumb as a box of fucking rocks. You got a bad bitch now... No, no, no, no. And speaking of a bad bitch, stop fucking with my wife around here. No, for real. Stop jacking off to her, - stop watching her. - Who told you? They snitching on me? No, she told me. You've been running around here with your little dinkle out and stuff. - Cut it out! - Did she tell you she don't like you 'cause you look like Lionel Richie? I don't look like no fucking Lionel Richie. - Yes, you do. - No, I don't look like Lionel Richie. You gotta look at it from my point of view. I've been locked up for two years now. I know. I put money on your fucking books. So I haven't seen nobody that fine... I ain't seen no woman. - All I've been seeing is dick. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Like, I mean... like, them niggas... - Them niggas in jail got big-ass dicks. - I don't wanna hear that shit! We in shower, they swinging dick everywhere. Shit missed and bumped me in my elbow, - and I was on the other side of the room. - Okay, okay, enough. Enough with other men. That... that's too much. Well, let me fuck your old lady. I won't talk about 'em no more. - ( Screams ) - What did I just say about you, Cronut? You think it's a fucking game. Stop playing. - ( Sighs ) All right. - We're having a family meeting in 10 minutes. Get my truck, put back the fuck together, and get in there on the meeting. - All right. - Take that black curtain rod off your head. - No, I got wave caps. - That ain't a wave cap. - I'm trying to get waves. - Them is fingerprints in your head, motherfucker. - No, this is nice waves. - ( door closes ) Yes, boss. I's-a getting to it. Treat me like I'm a goddamn slave. I'm your peoples! ( Helicopter whirring ) Now, this is a family meeting for the Blacks. Mm-hmm.

Come on, let's enjoy this. We in Beverly Hills. Look how nice this neighborhood is. Smell the fresh air. ( Inhales ) - It's nice, right? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, man, damn. - Allie: This is dumb. Don't try to take my side either, okay, because I still don't know you like that. Hey, hey, hey, watch your mouth now. Daddy, that's not my mother. I don't have to listen to her. My mother died, okay? That's just your wife. - Okay, now... now... - That's just a side chick that made it, okay?

That's why I got the switch. - Welcome, Blacks! - Hey, hey, hey! - Why you yelling? - Oh, you must excuse him. He gets so excited when we get to meet new people. - Especially different people. - ( snarls ) So welcome to our beautiful neighborhood. - I am Jim Smith and... - That makes me Mary Smith. - And we are... - Both: The Smiths. - We come bearing gifts. - I'll take that. - You eat this? - Uh, yeah. It's little goodies from Williams and Sonoma. - So it's food. - Never mind him. - He's not... he's a little... - Yeah, he's a... special needs.

It's okay, little fella. - That's a nice little guy. - What the fuck? - Jim... - Why are you rubbing him like a yorkie terrier? He is such a stinker. It's true, I am. I did not get your names. - You are...? - I'm Lorena. - Lorena. Latina? - Yes. - Un nombre bonito. - Mucho gracias. Okay, that's a fucking 'nough, Bill. - Come on, man, what are you doing? - Stop flirting, you. All that neato Telemundo shit. Why would you want that when you can have this? Sweetie, you know I can't resist a beautiful face. - Thank you. - You better put a leash on his ass. - And you are? - ( clears throat ) My name is Carl Black. Don't Hate Wiring. You've probably seen, you know, yeah. But I also own a new company now. It's called Mandingo Plumbing 'cause I lay pipe. - Carl. Carl, stop. - I'd like to lay some on your fat ass. - And I come right after it. - Lorena: Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. - Okay. - And look at this. - Are you a little black vampire? - ( snarls ) ( laughing ) - Lorena: Stop it. - It's a little ironic that... that your name is Black - because you are... - Don't say it, bitch. - Carl! - No, she know what she's doing. - Allie: Mm-hmm. - You moved into the house - at the end of Cherry Blossom, is that right? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I'll bet you got a deal on that one. I did... oh, we did get a good deal in it, yes. - Why? - Well, - Um. - let's just say the last owners left in a little bit of a hurry, mid-renovation. What the fuck is mid-renovation? - They didn't survive the Purge. - ( alarm blares ) Jim: But, you know, I'm sure... - Oh! - That's the first warning. - Yes. - Happy Purge, neighbors. - Happy Purge! - ( alarms blares ) - ♪ Give Daddy his... ♪ - ♪ Chi town, what we doing? ♪ ♪ Murder, murder Murder, murder ♪ ♪ Murder, murder, murder ♪ - ♪ Block is hella hot ♪ - ♪ Block is hella hot ♪ - ♪! 2 on the prowl ♪ - ♪! 2 on the prowl ♪ ♪ Nigga's getting shot ♪ - ♪ Fucking 9:00 to 5:00 ♪ - ♪ Fucking 9:00 to 5:00 ♪ - ♪ Niggas in the trap ♪ - ♪ Niggas in the trap ♪ - ♪ Bitches call my line ♪ - ♪ Bitches call my line ♪ ♪ Where the fuck you at? - ( guns firing ) - ( sirens blaring ) - ♪ Fear no man ♪ - ( animal howls ) ( alarm blares ) - ( sighs ) - Okay, well, here's dinner. - Whoa. - What is that?

It looks good. Yeah, it looks like a vampire chicken - after the sun comes out. - ( alarm blares ) That better be the sound for the club. ( Alarm blares ) What's with this Purge bullshit, all right? Oh, my God, Dad. You don't pay attention to anything. Tonight's only the most dangerous night all year. Yeah, people can get away with robbing, murdering, whatever crime they want for 12 hours. - And the police can't do anything about it. - Okay, okay, look, look. Enough with this Purge shit, all right? It's a damn joke. People don't purge in no damn neighborhood like this. - ( glass shatters ) - ( all screaming ) Shit, man, I just got out of prison, and here you go with this fuckin' shit. I didn't come out for this shit. I'm too old for this shit, man. - Shit. - Okay, maybe it was just down the street. Um, maybe we should board up the windows or something. - Yeah. - Blacula. Are you scared? I thought you was the night of the walking dead. I'm the living dead. The walking dead are zombies. I think Carl's Jr.'s right. We need to batten down the hatches. - You know what I'm saying? - No, no, no, listen, guys. I moved you guys to the safest zip code in the country, all right? They don't purge in neighborhoods like this. Back in Chicago, we couldn't even look out the windows, remember? - Yeah. - But at least we knew who was coming for us. Now, we're safe. This is protection. This is first class living right here, all right? We don't have to worry about all that crazy stuff. - ( Explosion ) - ( all screaming ) Oh, shit, I'd rather be in jail getting fucked. Fuck this shit. I ain't with this. They're ready to kill all the blacks. They are purging for blacks! - They want the niggas! - Shut up! Carl, we need to get everybody in the car right now and drive out of this crazy neighborhood right now! Listen, listen, listen. Listen, everybody. Listen, all right? Now, we're gonna go to the panic room. Relax. It's the purge, but it ain't for us, okay? - Okay. - All right, come on, let's go. Let's move. Let's go. ( Whimpers ) I thought we weren't allowed to go out there! - ( Explosion, glass breaks ) - We gotta go! ( Man laughing ) (party horn honks ) Thanks. Does asbestos smell like weed? 'Cause if so, I smell it. - ( Junior coughs ) - Shut up. Nothing. You see anything? Do you see anybody? - Junior: No. - All right, then. - Ooh, what does this button do? - Stop touching stuff, Junior. What? I didn't even do anything! Ever since Mom died, I can't do anything right. - Carl's Jr. - No. - ( Carl sighs ) - Dad, that was really messed up. You know what? I'm going to my room. And don't anyone come and check on me, okay? Not tonight. They acting like Will Smith's kids now. Carl, is she hiding something? - She's spoiled. - I know. All right, I'm gonna go check on them. I'll leave you alone. Carl's Jr! Are we in a scene of Diff'rent Strokes? 'Cause that's what it feels right now. You Mr. Drummond now. Cuz, just relax, cuz. They all know you got a lot of stuff on your mind. But you know what'll ease that? ( Inhales ) Smoke a little ganja. I got ya. I'm gonna roll up. - ( Glass shatters ) - ( guns firing ) - ( screeches ) - ( giggles ) Freezee! Ah! - ( Mumbling ) - ( moaning ) You're hot, nigga. - ( Knocking on door) - Not if I kill 'em first. Who that? - Oh, my God. Shh, shh! - What? Shh! You gotta go. Who is it? - Lorena. - Oh, shit. My dick hard. Let me just finish real quick. Go in my bathroom. - ( Knocking continues ) - Coming! ( Knocking continues ) Oh, okay. - What do you want? - Well, I wanna talk to you. - Are you coming in my room now? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - What's going on? - Okay, uh... - What are you doing? What do you want? I don't want anything. I just... Allie, listen. - Mm-hmm. - I just wanted to come talk to you because I am really not happy with all this fighting that's going on between us. I know I'm not your mother. - I don't want you to be my mother. - Trust me, I'm not. And I will never be your mother, but I want us to at least try and be friends. I don't like all this fighting that's going on. It's... It's uncomfortable. - Okay. - Okay, good. Look, I brought you a little gift, a little peace offering. You brought me something? My mom gave it to me. Oh, 'cause you don't got no money. It's a necklace of the Virgin Mary, and now I'm giving it to you to protect you tonight for this so-called Purge. - Thanks. - You like it? Yeah. Okay, how about a thank-you hug? - Okay. - Okay, come here. Oh, it's a hug, Allie. - God! - Allie: Okay. - Okay, goodbye. - All right. Bye! Thank you. Bye. Lorena: I'm gonna go talk to your brother. Allie: All right. Okay. - ( door closes ) - What are you doing? - I'm coming, I'm coming. - What are you doing? Look at how you live. - ( Groans ) - Oh, my God! Yo, man. It's never fucking enough. Man, it's hard trying to please this girl, my family, my cousin, my friends. - Ugh. - I'll tell you right now, I ain't one of them 'cause I'm proud of you, cuz. - Yeah? - Hell yeah, with the Wings and Things shit, man. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Shit, when I was locked up, cuz, the only thing I could think about was getting out of Chicago, and look at us now. Beverly Hills! Nigga, we made it. You got all types of shit. Look at all these lions, tigers, and bears, oh, my! - Yeah. - For real, nigga, like, are we on "Animal Planet" in this motherfucker? You ever watch that channel? Them motherfuckers be... You killed all this yourself? You're doing your thing, man, but for real, cuz, I'm telling you, man, like, you got me out of this shit. Like, when I grew up, only thing... you know, all I've been doing was robbing, stealing, cheating. Now I ain't gotta do none of that shit no more. And I know... I know your family tripping off me and everything, but let me tell you something. They'll get over it. The best thing about it... We 3,000 miles away in Beverly Hills from Key Flo's crazy ass. I do not wanna be around that nigga. - That nigga is... - Excuse me. Back up. Key Flo's out? Yeah, you ain't know that? I thought he had about five or six years. Nope, that nigga's good and out now. He killing all the witnesses now. For real, like, he is killing them. But the crazy part about it is the police never found the money or they didn't find the weed. He killed all the witnesses. Killed them all, man. You remember that grandma that told on him? - Bitch dead. - ( crashing, screaming ) Then he killed this preacher. This preacher was sitting there riding on a bicycle. - He shot her 72 times. - All right, shut the fuck up, man! I'm trying to tell you a story. Fuck Key Flo! All right? Why? You nervous? You... you should know bett... Weren't you with him the day... the day he got locked up? You was with him, right? 'Cause you were doing some installation on... No! Oh. I'm just saying, I mean, you're good, though. We're out here in Beverly Hills. Ain't nobody gonna fuck with us. ( laughs ) You act like you're with him or something. Look, I feel... I feel Key Flo, 'cause if that was my shit, nigga's gotta die. D-E-D. Die. Dead. Finito. ( Imitates bones breaking ) Killing everything... women, kids, grandma. Lions, tigers, all this shit. Nigga gotta die. Nigga's got... it's karma, bro. If you're gonna take something from somebody, - then he's gonna... - I gotta go.

It's my vampire lair. I see that. What are you doing? I would tell you, but I fear the NSA will implicate you. I completely get it. I get it. Are you doing okay? Yeah, it's just that Dad's always yelling at me. - And he just makes me mad sometimes. - You wanna talk about it? You don't have to be nice to me. What... what do you mean "have to"? I know I'm a weirdo. My real mom could barely stand to be around me. She have birth to me. All you did was marry my dad. Okay, listen. Your mom loved you. I promise you she loved you. And I, believe it or not, can totally stand to be around you. - Really? - Yeah. Well, most of the time. - Thanks, Lorena. - All right, listen. We have a deal, okay? You don't hide anymore. We're gonna stick together. We're gonna be a team, okay? - Okay. - All right. Mm, mm, mm! Oh, my God! ( Humming ) Where's my lighter at? ( Humming ) - Hey. - You got another one of these?

( chainsaw motor whirs ) - Let's go. - CJ, come on. Hello, Carl. Or should I call you Mr. Black? How do you know my name? We know how you can afford to live in this neighborhood, - and you're not welcome. - You've been Googling my ass? You're not wanted here, Carl. We enjoy watching your kind on the football field, the basketball courts, and the boxing ring. But we pay for cable TV to see you on our television, not to live in our neighborhood. - ( Chuckles ) - Daddy, I'm scared. It's a matter of time before your wife starts to braid hair like Allen Iverson! Why does he still have the braids? We like Allen Iverson's braids. - Yeah. - We do. Mr. Black, it's a matter of time before our wives want to sleep with you. And I do not want you destroying my wife's guts. So I must destroy you. You think I'm scared of you? We don't want a nigga. - What? Oh! - What? You out of your mind? - Too much? - Yeah! - What the hell are you thinking? - Way too much. Sorry about that, Carl. Nah, fuck all that. No, no, don't be sorry. Your ass is grass for saying that. That's on me. I really wanna apologize for that. So everything else I meant. That last part I didn't, so sorry about that. Don't... that ain't... - Put the... - Dude, just... just let... You wanna be sorry? Get out my motherfucking house. Tonight, you're being purged for being a liar, Carl Black, Tonight, you're being purged for being a liar, Carl Black, - and I'm coming in there! - You can't get in here! - Yeah. - Watch, bitch. It's protected by Viper! I'm going to cut the power now, Mr. Black. So it's going to be harder to see you and your family. Maybe if you smile, it would help us find you in the dark. - ( Chuckles ) - ( motor whirs ) - ( Lorena gasps ) - Kids: Oh! Fuck. Fuck. Jesus. My power tool has run out of gas. What are the chances? I'll be back, Mr. Black. Why is my power tool out of gas? The Purge is the same time every year, you two imbeciles. - ( electricity crackles ) - ( all scream ) - Junior: I'm scared of the dark. - Allie: What? How are you a vampire and scared of the dark? Vampires are scared of the dark sometimes. It's just a little thing that goes on. Carl: Don't worry about it. We're on lockdown. They can't do nothing to us. - They killed the power, huh? - ( all screaming ) - ( Allie whimpers ) - Up with y'all? What the hell? Where'd you come from? I came through the back. - Junior: The back? - What the hell you mean you came through the back? - We on lockdown! - Clearly, we're not. Man, you got a lot of broke windows out there in the back. You need to get that shit checked. You ain't check that shit on Zillow before you bought this shit? Look, if that window's open... - Mm-hmm. - who knows what else is open. You go check out the front, and I'ma go check out the back. Wait, wait, wait, black people don't split up. - Yeah. - We gotta split up tonight. Girls, y'all stay here. Come on, let's do it. - ( Door closes ) - All right, guys. Listen, we're gonna be fine as long as we stay together. I can't take this anymore. I have to go. - Both: Carl's Jr! - Allie: God! - ( Gunfire ) - ( glass shattering ) ( dog barking ) The Purge is on, motherfuckers! ( laughing ) - Who's there? - Woman: Welcome to the neighborhood, Blacks! Woman: Hey, hey! They're upstairs! They're upstairs! It's gonna be okay. Dark is just the opposite of light. - ( Man shouting ) - I don't play that shit. You think you're gonna run me out of this nice-ass house? I'm from the hood. Can't nothing fuck with me. ( Gunfire in distance ) Man: Once you go black, you die! Bitch, this is not a game. ( Man screams in distance ) ( locks door) ( screaming continues ) Shut the fucking door around here, shit. Man: Bitch-ass! ( laughter) Bad night to be a lyin', thievin' runaway. Key Flo, what you doin' in L.A., baby? ( laughing ) Crazy shit goin' on out there tonight, Carl, huh? You scared, Carl? No, I ain't scared. I'm just doing some dishes for my family. ( Stammering ) Fuck am I scared... be scared of? You look real good, Carl. Oh, I appreciate it.

Well, I'm mocha brown. Damn, I heard you just got out too, man. You look good. They said you was just rollin' around the neighborhood, man, and decided you want to stop in my kitchen. ( laughing ) - Yeah, to your kitchen. - Yeah. Looks pretty good, marble tables... - Since we old friends, I need to know... - Oh, shit. How much a place like this costs. - Hmm? - Oh, what? Man, you know this ain't really, like, a real mansion. - Really? - Yeah. Whatever you paid, it had to be steep. I got some financial backers, man. Financial backers? Maybe like Bank Key Flo. - Remember that? - Aah! - Huh? You forgot about how you left Chicago? - ( sobbing ) With a whole lot of money and a whole lot of drugs that didn't belong to you. I'm not even gonna bring up the shit you stole - besides that, you know. - What did I take? - A space heater. - I didn't take no damn space heater. Nigga, you took my space heater, nigga! - ( Groaning ) - That's right. You took my toilet seat with the dollar bills on it. - A toilet seat? - You know what the fuck I'm talking about! I don't even like toilet seats! That's one thing about me. Guess what? You gonna get my money and my dope back. Tonight. - Why are you so angry? - Nigga, you don't need to worry about all that. - You know what you need to worry about? - What? Is that tonight, I can kill you for free. - For free? - For free. Won't go back to jail. You'll just be smoked, nigga. Off the count. You know what I'm saying? You're gonna give me all my shit back... tonight. How did you get out here, on Southwest? I know you's a funny nigga and all that, but I ain't in the mood for no jokes right now. I know it, and I'm trying to make sure that me and you don't fall out. I'm gonna give you your money back.

Whoever let you walk out the house with that jacket is not your friend. Nigga! This ain't the time for your goddamn... ( screams ) I want my money and my dope, nigga. Tonight. You wrong, man, 'cause you got busted. When the police came looking for you, you left, and that's when I took the stuff. The police was gonna get it anyway. - Hey, baby. - Carl, you lied to me. Baby, not right now. Come on. You have this man in here with a gun about to purge us, and you're lying? No, I didn't, I didn't... Look, I can't explain it to you right now, but I'll explain it to you later, all right? Can't catch a break tonight, can you, Carl? - Daddy, help me! - Oh, I think that's Allie. That's my daughter right there, man, they gonna purge me!
