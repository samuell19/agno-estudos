We want our say! Women demand equal pay! We want our say! Women demand equal pay! We want our say! Women demand equal pay! -No? -No. -Konumáttur! -What? My grandmother in Iceland always said that. "Woman, seize the day!" Konumáttur! And seven? Do I hear eight? Eight? Eight! Sold for 1,2 million. I miss you. One final look at the VAT books before Christmas. I balanced those Tuesday. -Can't we go home, then? -No, it will be an hour or two. -You go ahead. -Fine. See you at home, then. Drive carefully. The roads are slippery! -Yes, Berling? -Hello Marie. Just a reminder about our date at 12 tomorrow at Vanja's. -Are you there? -I'm afraid I have to cancel. Seriously? This is the third year in a row! I'll call you after Christmas. We'll find a day that works for all three of us. I promise. -I thought I'd prep the duck. -Taste this one. I got it recommended. It's nice, isn't it? It tastes just like the one we usually buy. It's really nice to see you. -Here comes more food. -How lovely. -There. -Come on, grandma. -You can make them huge. -I sure can. Grandma, are we having Chrissy Pudding? Of course we're having Christmas Pudding, sweetie. Everything will be just like we're used to. -Any rubbish to get rid of? -Mum, sit down and relax. I'm just going to... Sara, please put that away and be with the rest of us. But Grandpa's constantly texting as well! Mum, do you think it's possible for us to take over Grandma's house? Niels and Josefine could live there too, and Lars and me - - In the middle. All our children and grandchildren together? That sounds like a great idea! Henrik? Yeah... Sure, good idea. Hi! Here we are! I can tell. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Sinus. Could you hold him while I get my coat off? Joachim? Take him, please? Berling, I'm just going to put Sinus' food in the fridge. I take it we're not having duck or roast pork? You’re finally catching on! -What are we having, Grandma? -It's Berling. -We're having sushi. -I love sushi! Would it be so terrible for you to prepare a traditional Christmas dinner? I guess we'll never know. It's Christmas Eve. You can have that talk later. When? It's not like we see each other a lot. No, but we might. Perhaps Gra... Berling... Maybe she'd like to babysit sometime? Does that look anything like a babysitter? Did you go to the graveyard to visit Dad? Yes, you did! Time for some fresh air, huh? And then back in to have your bone! -Mum? -Yes? You have to throw this cup out. It's chipped. It was Dad's. It's not going anywhere. It's been eight years. Isn't it time to move on? Tilde, I have moved on just fine. I mean, you've quit teaching. -What about the rest of your life? -Stop it, Tilde. I can't just take up glass-blowing all of a sudden, can I? That sounds horrendous. -Maybe you'll find the one... -Tilde! Your father was the one. Thank you, darling! This is to Marie from Henrik. Oh... It has multiple functions. That's much needed. Thank you, dear. This is from all of us to you and Dad. Oh my. What can it be? What is this? -I don't have my glasses. -I'll do it. "The Food Club. An exclusive cooking class in Apulia, Italy, for two." Thank you, all of you. But surely we don't have time for that. Mum, you haven't been on holiday for years. -True. -Of course you're going. Maybe it's about time. Thank you. -Thank you. How nice of you. -Thank you. Look, the gift card is here on the floor. -It shouldn't be. -What do you say? -Let's see where we're by then. -Right here, I believe. It's in less than one week. Is something wrong? Everything's fine. I just don't want to go to Italy. Oh? Everybody loves Italy. Marie, I think... I think we need to talk. So something is wrong. What is it? Are you sick? What is it, then? Have you found someone new? Marie, darling... I believe we should focus on getting through Christmas... And then... -And then? And then what? We're getting a divorce? No, we're not, mark my words! You don't just throw 44 years out the window... I can't talk about this now. I... I need to go outside for some fresh air. You'll have to excuse me. Yes. Yes, I'm coming. Oh Christ?! Hello? Is someone there? There! Marie, is that you? -Marie, honestly... -How dare you? -I know it's tough... -Let me. How dare you steal my husband like that! -If you dare destroy... -What's gotten into you? Let's see if we can find our unfortunate friend. Unfortunate? She's damn lucky to have us come running. Oh, Berling. Well, that's what friends are for. -She needs us right now. -Yeah, yeah. -I'm here, aren't I? -Sure. -The cavalry's here! Merry Christmas. -Yeah, merry Christmas. -What a mess, darling. - One bottle of Liébart-Régnier, please. -This isn't a cause for celebration. -There's always a cause for celebration. If anything, the trio's together again. Yes. Oh, darling. Oh... Marie, it's okay to be sad. Your only revenge is to live as long and good a life as possible. You're one to talk. You were always just you. I've been "we" for 44 years. Wife, mother, grandmother. -It's who I am. -You're Marie too, right? Yes, and she was there before everything else, before she met that dreary asshole Henrik. Come on, Vanja. You find him crazy boring as well! -God, no! -Okay, whatever you say. This is what the kids gave us. I really wanted a refund, but... I actually think you two should go. This looks amazing. -I'm in! -Sure, me too. But you're coming, Marie. We're all going. -No, I have too much work to do. -No, come on. -Marie, we hardly ever get to see you! -Hardly ever! Would you rather stay at home crying over that bastard, or go to Italy to laugh with your friends for a week? The sun will make you forget everything about Henrik and his garden gnome. Right, Vanja? Say something, damn it! I'd love to, but you talk a mile a minute. It doesn't have to end here. Maybe it's just an affair. Maybe he just needs some air so he'll miss you even more. He'll come around. Right? -He can't get by without me. -No. -He's going to miss the hell out of me! -Yes! -Of course he'll come back. -Of course he will. -She can't escape, can she? -No, she can't! Fine! We'll do it! Konumáttur! Look at those cute little houses! Travelling with you two sure is a blast! -Get your nose out of that map. -What if we take the wrong road? God forbid we'd experience something that wasn't planned! Those little smurf houses are called "trulli". They say Santa comes from Apulia. How funny! -What's happening? -Please tell me you're lying. -No, no, no. -It's a little... -What the hell did you do? -Let me just... Why didn't we let them pick us up at the airport? But no! "It's so much cooler to arrive in your own car"! Well, it is. -That smell! -Great, isn't it? -I can't smell anything. -Of course you can't. I'm just going to text Henrik that I’ve arrived. He’s always so nervous when I travel. Let him think you went down with the plane. He's supposed to miss you. How come we don't have that name in Denmark? Our names are so dull. Ib, Bo, Bent. -But Allessandro... -Easy, Berling. Down to 100. You could be his mother. Italians love all women. Especially, Marie... -Especially their mothers. -Look! 765 492 results for how to win your man back. -So you live here all year around? -Yes, it's our house. That must be the other course participants. Mum? Can you hear me? -Hi, Tilde! We're connected! -Good. -Hi, sweetie. How's Miller? -He's fine. I just gave it a bone... You know he's a "he", not an "it"? Miller. Miller? Tilde, put the laptop on the floor. I want to see him. Sure. Come. -Miller? Miller. -Miller? Miller, Miller, Miller. -Who's there? -Aww, Miller, dear. -It's so good to see you. -Miller? -"Make him jealous". -Come here. -"Get a makeover". -Mummy's furry little boy. -Mum misses you. -"Write a heartfelt letter". -He's so cute! -"Write a poem". -"Impress him". -I don't see him. -"Do something special". -You’re driving me crazy! Hi, hello! Can... Sit. Can you sit? You're so good! -Hi. -Hi. -Should we stretch? -Yeah. Wow, you smoke! Hardly any adults do that now. You have incredible skin for a smoker. -May I ask how old you are? -No, you may not. Okay, I'm sorry! Come on, honey. The cold shower's waiting. -Bye! -Bye. There you are. -The introduction's starting. -I'm just going to finish this. -I'm not taking notes for you. -Oh, God no! Is that pot you're smoking? -THAT you smelled? -Are you out of your mind, Berling? What if customs had stopped you? -I'd blame Vanja. -You're crazy. Are you coming? Cheese! -Shouldn't we state our names? -Sure, I'll start. I'm Vanja Friis. I'm a retired Danish and History teacher. I'm here with my two old schoolmates. We are Morten and Mette Lauridsen. -This is part of our ten year plan. -To visit all the world's cuisines. Last year we were in Africa. -So if you'd like to make... -Fufu. -Or... -What's it called again? -Shakshuka. -Shakshuka... Let us know. How exciting. I'm a landscape gardener, and I simply love Italy and Italian food. I just don't know how to make it, but I hope I'll learn. My two teenage boys are getting tired of meatloaf from the supermarket. -And do you have a name? -No, I prefer to stay anonymous. No, my name's Jacob! Oh? I didn’t get that. -Marie. -Yes. So, I'm Marie. I'm an accountant in mine and my husband's company. You're much more than that! Yes, I've been married 44 years, and I have two sons. I was supposed to go with my husband, but then... ...he contracted mumps. -Oh? -Mumps can be pretty serious. It affects fertility. -Not that it matters that much now. -No. -There's swelling. -In the crotch area. That's why we went instead. Is it contagious? -Aren't you going to get ready? -I'm not coming. What's that nonsense? -That's my decision. -Are you just going to sit here? No, I want to write Henrik a heartfelt letter. -Can't you do that later? -You have to eat. No thanks, I'm not hungry. I know it must be hard, Marie. Your situation is a lot like mine. You can't possibly compare them! You and Jens were together till the very end. My husband's alive and well, and my entire life's about to fall apart. I'm just saying, you feel like half a person when you lose... Just go. You know she'll use any excuse to talk about Jens. The man's legacy's been improving for each year following his death. -I'll get Henrik back. -Are you sure that's what you want? You don't understand. You've never had someone special in your life. I think it's bold of people like you to go on this kind of holiday. People like us? Normally, people your age usually travel in groups. -With other old... Seniors. -Yes. -We'll see. -I have my doubts! -You don't have to wait. -Of course. Thank you for not outing me. Oh, the cat? No big deal. -I owe you a limoncello. -Yes, please. Not tonight, though. I have to say good night to Miller. Why isn't he here? Because he's a dog and a terrible cook. I'm glad he's not here. I love dogs, but I'm afraid of them. What? No way. You're a big, strong guy! Yes, and just a small, scared possum on the inside. -Miller? -Named after Glen. Jens, my late husband. He was a big fan. He's good. I'm more of an Oscar Peterson guy myself. -Me too, or Stan Getz. -Getz! I saw his last show in Copenhagen at Montmartre. Magical. That's funny. I actually had tickets to that show, but I got sick. -No! -Yes. Can you imagine... And you were there, you lucky little possum. Hi! Finally! There you are! Hi! -Time to have some fun! -She smoked my joint! Can you smell it? There she is. The garden gnome. -That hair's insane. -She sure loves pink. No way. Look at those ridiculous garden gnomes I told you about. What’s up with that?! No, she owns a cat? Henrik hates cats! He's allergic. -When she was young. -Not very smart looking, or what? We all looked like that back then. I felt pretty swanky in my patent leather hotpants. That's all you ever wore. -What's this? -Tango! She dances tango. We've got to watch that video. I think I'm going to say good night. Marie... Anyone can learn to tango! And with that hair she should be in an institution. You think there's a hairdresser in this town? Of course. This isn't Chernobyl. They said a makeover would do you good. -I'm going to do that tomorrow. -Yes, that's a good idea. The world looks different when you treat yourself. God damn it, Marie. I'm starting to see why Henrik's left. Henrik gave it to me. Show me the pretty little thing you sleep in, then. You know she always sleeps naked. You better put some clothes on! That's the first time someone's said that to me, going to bed. Vanja, 14. -Good morning. -Good morning. -Berling, get up. -Lovely weather, isn't it? Yes, it is. They have people to do that for you. I feel better when I have something to do. There you go. What's this? Next. Is it a night lamp, or for storing your rings? -Marie, that's what I use for pleasure when I don't have a man nearby. I'm not entirely sure how it works. Me neither. Do you put both... Ears... up? Up your... And then... Both? -At once? -If there's room. No one eats more cake and sweets for breakfast than the Italians. I can't believe they're not gasping for air with all the gluten they get in one day. There you go, honey. -Thanks, honey. -Let's go. So us elderly aren't the only ones taking pills? -These are all natural products. -Careful, or you'll live forever. That's the point! Right, honey? -What are you doing with that phone? -Nothing. I can't believe Henrik hasn't replied. I'm sure he's just busy at the office, now that you're away. Right? -What are you whispering about? -Henrik didn't reply to her text. Of course he didn't. He's busy fooling around with the garden gnome. -Berling. -What's she doing with him? A pathetic, self-centred prick with a late-onset midlife crisis. -What did he mean by that? -That we can do as we please, suppose. -But we don't have a clue. -I know, isn't it exciting? No, it's not. It's a sidetrack. Pretty little stem, I'm going to remove you. How pretty you look lying on my plate. Let's make a little cut, and another cut... My little... She's always done that. How about I just pour lots of wine in? -You've got to be kidding me. -Behave. She was supposed to treat herself, not put herself in a copier. Nice, Marie. Now, who do you remind me of? Will you take a few photos? I want to show Henrik. -You need to provide some assistance. -Let's bring in a little expertise. Let's see, Marie. Just go like... There. Up. -Smile for the camera. -Put your arm up. -And the last one. That'll do. -There. I can't get enough of that language! They could tone down the big gestures a notch. One can tell you've never dated an Italian. I have! Come on! Francesco? The guy only came when seeing himself in the mirror above the bed! I love Italian men's arms. Tanned with black hairs, gold watches... And an open shirt. But someone's taking a liking to Vanja. -What? -The landscape gardener. Come on. He's ten years younger than me. Please. More like eight. And so what, if there was a 20 year difference? Take Macron et Brigitte. That's how Berling sees herself in a relationship. The president's wife, no less. Now, Marie. Get your bum up to smacking height. I beg your pardon? You don’t have to marry them. Just flirt a little. -I haven't flirted for 44 years. -About time, then. And it wouldn't hurt for you to get some dick. -Italian, passionate dick. -Berling... What the hell is she saying? I love how you're not letting your age get in your way. Man, it's hot in here. -Welcome to menopause. -I don't think so. -That's amazing. -You look totally fuckable. -Sold. My treat. -No, Berling. You can't do that. That's the least I can do. You gave us the trip. You know how you only buy batik in Bali, and Retsina only tastes good in Greece. I wouldn't normally go for this. -Only better, if you ask me. -It looks great on you. You look five years younger in it. Buy, buy, buy! This is where the action is! Watch out, here I come! I get more and more liver spots on my hands every day. You should see my back. I'm starting to look like Pippi Longstocking's horse. How come she bears her age so well? I'm sure it wasn't cheap. I want to get up and look at the view. Give me a hand. It's from Julie. They don't want to spent Christmas with me anymore. I do look hot in this one, don't I? -I'm sorry, did you hear me? -Yeah, Julie's done with Christmas. Odd message to send me when I'm on holiday. This one's even better! Don't you think so? You're always welcome to celebrate Christmas with Tilde and me. -But you ought to talk. -It's not easy with her. Julie's just so touchy. How do you deal with that? -What do you think, Marie? -What? Thanks, I'm good. I think you need to look at things from Julie's perspective. We're so different. She never understood me. -I think I'm going to get some work done before we go in the kitchen. I'm doing the work schedule for next year, and Henrik's going to love me for it. He's quite cute, isn't he? I don't understand why Henrik's not responding to my messages. Has he become bewitched by the gnome? Marie, Henrik is also to blame for this. Right? -How did you two meet? -Morten actually proposed to me at seven. I kept proposing every year until she said yes. We know it sounds like something from a film. Just you wait. You're thinking everything's fine. That you're inseparable all the way to the nursing home, to the grave. And then... Boom! He throws himself into the bosom of a sex-crazed garden gnome. If Morten leaves me, I’ll just follow him, right? I'm not going anywhere, honey. I love you. Love you. What are you doing? You’re like a child! -It's impossible to think in here. -Relax, Marie. Berling, look. -Vanja, he seems like Mr Right. -Well... -Mr Right's came and went. -But he's a name on a gravestone. This one's flesh and blood. -No way. -Look at them treading. I hope we're not doing that. Why? I bet it's super fun. I've always dreamed of doing that. Imagine the wet grapes between your toes. -Extremely sensual. -Extremely gross. Marie! Back in the day you'd have loved this. The mud-bath, and you, drunk as a skunk with that Hungarian. I finally got a reply from Henrik. And a smiley! I do look good in that photo, right? -Yes. -Maybe I'll try to make him jealous. Konumáttur! Please, can we pass. Take that street. I'll go around. That's it, Marie! Didn't your mother teach you not to steal, you little thief? Marie! You're awesome! You were awesome, Marie. There's no denying it. You're amazing! -You were just insane. -Very impressive. Tell me, aren't you going to eat anything? -No, we're fasting. -Not great when you're in cooking class. That attitude is the reason people gain weight on holiday. I've set out to challenge my bathroom scale. I went on a fattening diet as a kid. I couldn't gain. Funny. I have the same problem. Just the other way around. You look just right. -What are you doing? -I... Nothing. My family and I will have an early night. What was that? Why would you do that? Damn it! -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm good. I'd love to wear a dress like that, but I can't with these saggy things. When I'm dancing. Vanja, the trick is not to move too much. Like this. Otherwise... Shall we? You go. I'm going to say hello to the kids. -Hi, Grandma! -How's Italy? I'll tell you when I get home. -Happy New Year. -Happy New Year! -Let me talk to Grandma. -Hi, Niels. -Hi, mum. Happy New Year. -Happy New Year. -Have you heard from Dad? -Happy New Year, Mum! Cheers! -Cheers, Lars. Happy New Year. -Happy New Year, Grandma! Look, I'm sorry, Mum. It... Dad just stopped by, and... And he'd brought her, and... We didn't really have a choice but to let them in. You weren't supposed to see that. -Mum, are you alright? -Yes, yes. See you when I get home. Bye! Happy New Year... Easy, Marie. I have a surprise for you. If you dare, that is. A surprise? -What is it? -I can't tell you. Or it wouldn't be a surprise. Are you in? -Yeah... Is it here? -It's not here, it's somewhere else. -I... I can't. -Why not? It's New Year's Eve. I'm spending it with my friends. Okay. Some other time. -It's almost time. -Time to hurry. Ten, nine, eight Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! Happy freaking New Year! -Marie, darling. Happy New Year. -Happy New Year, darling. Happy New Year. There you are, waving your long, crazy hair in his face, wrecking an entire family! How do you sleep at night? You should... Shame on you! You bitch. You oversexed garden gnome! There. Oh, God... Marie? Marie, get up. What is it? You wrote to the garden gnome. Has everyone read it? Henrik? Her friends and colleagues? Yeah, that's kind of how Facebook works. -Only she was supposed to see it. -But you posted it on her wall. -Wall? -278 angry smileys. Must be a new record. -Shit, it's Henrik. -Calm down. Put it on speaker. -What were you thinking, Marie? -I'm sorry, Henrik... -I'm so sorry. -This isn't like you at all. No, but I didn't know how this wall thing worked. Jette's completely devastated. What do you want me to do? All I can do is apologize. Although she should actually be apologizing to me. Listen. If we're ever going to have a somewhat decent life together, you can't act like that. -We? -Me and Jette. And I think we... You and me... We have to reconsider... We can talk when you get home. No, say it. I have my doubts as to whether we can work together. -Are you firing me? -I could buy you out. It's not unnatural to retire at your age. -I'm two years younger than you. -You'll have lots of time and money. You know what? Go ahead and start looking for my replacement. And good luck with that! -Now I'm out of a job. -It'll be fine. I can't just be a grandmother. -What's my reason to get out of bed? -This is a blessing in disguise. How much fun is it really to do damage control for your lazy husband? But I love my work. -You could study. -Yeah, get yourself a new education. And graduate by the time I retire? Get a hobby. Hey, it’s not the blue Nivea, okay? Maybe I need to get my own garden gnome. Good idea, Marie. That will do the trick. Or just get me some, like Berling says. Dick? Get some dick. That's nice. Yeah, I'm going to get me some dick. Jacob? -Could you help? -Of course. What do you need? A little bit of everything. -Do you like meatballs? -I love meatballs. -Should I grab the oil? -Yes, please. I was your age when I reached menopause. -No, that's not it. -Yes, darling. It's a hot flush. You'll learn to live with it. I just don't get it. I eat so much red clover. I shouldn't reach menopause now. It's not fair. I know I may seem afraid to act my age, but I believe Vanja's right when she says age is a bit like the weather. We can talk about it, but we can't do anything about it. I'm sorry. I thought you would understand. And I do. But you'll never look as pretty as you do now. Enjoy it. Soon, you'll face bigger problems and look a lot worse. -Great. -Mette! There you are! Thanks. It'll be fine, honey. -It was a lovely dinner. -Yeah, you should have some. It's really good. Those pomegranates... I think they're made from... I don't know, lemon zest... It tastes delicious. -Thanks, you're an amazing dancer. -Likewise. Thanks. It was a pleasure. Excuse me. Vanja? May I squeeze in? I want to check the pantry for those green olives that Allessandro keeps hiding from me. I see you are craving olives as well, huh? That's all I wanted to say. Bye. -Another power outage. -Well, talk about timing. Here. Take my hand. Let's go. I thought you could use some company here in the dark. Marie, we need to talk about this. -What's there to talk about? -That's so typical of you! I had no idea she wanted him! Besides, I'm the one who needed cheering up. Isn't that a tad head up your own ass? That's rich coming from you. You always do as you please. You've never been dumped, because you run before things get serious. Excuse me, Marie. She's always been there for us. Unlike you, who withdraw from us for long periods of time. Yeah, in favour of activities with the grandchildren. At least I have a good relationship with my offspring. -You sent Julie to boarding school. -She wasn't planned. You know that. Bill was married, and I wasn't ready to care for... I was afraid of being a bad mum. -And then you became one. Good night. -Marie, cut it out. And Vanja, you love your dog more than you love Matilde. How would you know? Soon you can host a picnic for Jens and Miller in the graveyard. Marie! That's enough! Marie, where were you when Jens died? -I went to his funeral. -Yeah, how nice of you. After that. There were annual accounts, dinners with Henrik's clients and whatnot. Should I apologize for having a demanding job? A boring job as Henrik's personal secretary. Join the game, Marie. Live. Have fun. Let your hair down. Let my hair down? That's your answer to everything. I didn't end up as a prim, proper and boring old bat like you. You always have to talk down to me. I'm not afraid of growing old. It's a pathetic sight to watch you act younger than you are. At least I'm having fun, unlike you! For the record, I love Tilde very much. Yeah, but not as much as you love Jens and his shitty gravestone. Fuck you, Marie. Some friends I have! If I've actually become the kind of boring person one would divorce... At least you could have fucking told me! Have a good night, you two. Thanks. Are you ready for your surprise? You wanted to try this, no? No way! That's so cool! -I made some calls. -How cool is this! Take off your shoes. -Here's what we're going to do... -You're going in? I'll stand here. This is so nice! Fantastic. I don't think... No! I think I'm too old to have sex in a bathtub full of grapes. -Listen... -Yes? -When we get home... -Home? Yes, when we get home to Denmark. I had a vision in my head of us, dating, on a bench in the Castle Gardens, for the jazz festival......and all sorts of things, together. Vanja? -Can I taste it? -Please. -Chocolate. -It's nice. Vanja, pass the salami, please? -That one. -Pass it on, please? Thanks. It's so great to get this self-awareness. It was all a bit too much, right? Exactly, honey. So we've decided to do something else. -Okay? -To turn our lives around. We found this amazing course in the Andes. -A silent retreat. -You don't make a sound for 14 days. Good to see you're finally eating at least. That's what it's all about. Making the most of our time here. And no one knows if there's life after death. Sometimes there isn't even life before death. Can't we bring those up to our room? Vanja? Will you join me for a walk later? -Did you eat your cookie? -I will, soon. This is good! He asked you a question, you know? I just chose to postpone the answer. What happened last night? Was he bad in bed? What is it? I don't think I can be with a smoker. -E-cigarettes. -They smell weird. And he's afraid of dogs. This is my first time making brasato, and the last. -Something wrong? -Yeah, as usual. Well, I'm off on a quick walk in the herb garden. He wants to see me back home. I can't do that. It's too... Real. I can't bear the thought of getting used to a new set of bad habits, listening to him snore and learning the names of all his sons. I thought he only had two? These are some lousy excuses. Besides, I've got Jens. Do you? I'd like to apologize for last night. But, weren’t we all out of line? We have to continue with the brasato, Berling. We're going to add a few spices. -Does it taste nice? -Lovely. And a bit of basil. And I don't give a damn. -We need some oil. -Yes. I've found a male masseur. You could need one as well. Hurry back. See you. Bye! Hi. -Hi. -I'll be leaving in a few hours. -It's my son's birthday. -Happy birthday. And have a safe journey. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. You look like someone called Vanja, but I guess you're not. Hi. Jacob. Landscape gardener. In love with Vanja from yesterday. She's not here anymore, I’m afraid. Vanja, life gives you very few chances. I'm sorry. -Vanja? -Please leave me alone, Marie. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Have a nice trip Vanja... I'm so sorry. Most of all for not being there when you needed me. There might be room for two Mr Rights in one's life. I just wanted to let you know I want to go to a jazz festival. Did you come all this way to tell me that? So you want to go to a jazz festival with me? That's all you wanted to say? Okay. And all sorts of things, with you. -Check out this parmesan! It’s snow! -Morten! Look! Better than Regaine! Hairdresser Mette at your service! Let's cut it. Is there something wrong? Berling? Berling? What is it? I wet my pants. Come on! It happens! At our age, I mean. Marie, I'm exhausted. I had a complete breakdown at the massage today because I haven't been touched in three years. Three years, Marie! You're right. I'm pathetic. No more than Vanja and I. There, there... -Growing old sucks. -Yeah, but we can handle it. I promise. And I will be there for you. Yes. All the way. And Berling... Please give Julie a call. Try to listen. Find out what she needs. Offer to babysit Sinus and Anna. That's always a big hit. And there's nothing better than a child's arms hugging you. Everything alright? No. But that's not going to stop us, right, Berling? Come. I never pictured ending up as an old arse. Well... At least we can be old arses together. You just put it here? There. How pretty you are without makeup. Thanks. Sorry to bother you, but do you know where Keldsen's client list is? It's in your desk. Third drawer on the left. Thanks. I'm about to go crazy. Everything's a mess. Everything. I've been thinking. I believe things went a little fast. -What do you mean? -That we should still work together. -Like we always have. -Really? Marie, let's go. I could pick you up at the airport. -Yes... That'd be great. -Good, it's a deal. Have a safe trip. -Julie. -Hi, Julie. It's me. -It's Mum. -Hi. Do you have time to talk? -I'd love to talk. -I want to apologize. -We don't need sunglasses here. -No, you don't. -Thank you. -Thank you. -See you in a couple of years. -No! No..! Let's see each other regularly. -Maybe we'd form a food club? -A food club? -Yes! -That's a good idea. First Friday of the month. -Works for me. -Me too. -Every month! -Yes! My God. It's Henrik. What the hell is he doing here? And he's brought flowers. Welcome home. -Thank you. That's nice. -That's the least I could do. Are you ready to start tomorrow? The company really needs you. Henrik... I think I've exerted myself in all the wrong places. I'd rather spend my energy on something other than... ...knowing where Keldsen's client list is. -What are you going to do? -I don't know. Have fun. Let my hair down, I think. Have fun and let your hair down? You sound like Berling. That crazy woman's always been a bad influence. As for that little know-it-all Vanja... They both make me want to throw up. Only one person in my life makes me want to throw up! Konumáttur! Way to go! -Is it big enough? -Yes. I thought you said your kids made a bid for your mother's house. Yes, but I dismissed it. Now it's all about us. -Okay, Miller. Are you going for a walk with Jacob? Are you sure I can't join you for dinner? It's always just us girls on December 25th. -Fine. -You two enjoy yourselves. See you later, darling. We're here! Hi, girls! Are you ready for a proper Italian Christmas lunch? -You bet! -But first... -This is mostly from you. -We have a gift for the hostess. -Thank you. How nice of you. -I know, right? Can't wait to see how it works. FOR MUM
