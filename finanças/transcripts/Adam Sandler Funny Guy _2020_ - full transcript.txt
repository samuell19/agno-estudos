Guess how we're getting to the prom? Our very own limousine. - Oh man, how'd you score that? - [Narrator] Throughout this time, he continued to perform standup comedy shows.

His successful string of films continued into the late 1990s and he received much acclaim for his role as an unsuccessful ice hockey player who discovers a passion for golf in the comedy film "Happy Gilmore" in 1996. - Well, it was an idea that Adam Sandler, who's the star, had with his partner, Tim Hurlihy. They're both hockey fans, they're both golf fans, and thought it would be cool to meld the two together, the blue collar, fighting mentality of hockey with the upper-crust sort of staid vision of golf, and bring that to golf. Punching, hitting, cheering. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] He followed it up with other comedic roles, such as his role in "The Wedding Singer" and "The Water Boy," his first hit film in 1998. - I want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you, and then I want you to attack.

Nice and dry. No more wetness. (baseball clunks) - [Narrator] The fun, loving comedy about a man pulling his life together for the sake of a child was popular with audiences, but received mixed reviews. The beginning of Sandler's battle with the critics. - We read a script that was a good movie, but I didn't think I'd be too good at it. And then we talked to the president of the company, Amy Pascal, and she said that me and my buddy could rewrite it and tailor it more for what I think I could do. And we did it like that. They laid down a nice script up top. And then we kind of did our own comedy with it. - [Reporter] How exciting. (smooth music) - [Narrator] This role won Sandler various awards, including a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for best actor, and People's Choice Award for favorite comedy motion picture.

Granting him a Golden Globe nomination. in 2004, Sandler starred alongside Drew Barrymore for the much loved romantic comedy, "50 First Dates." The film was originally written as a drama, but once Sandler was on board he rewrote the script into a comedy, adding in jokes and lighthearted moments to the storyline. Despite some negative articles, the film received mostly positive reviews. The early 2000s saw Sandler appear in a variety of films, all receiving mixed reviews from critics. Many critics knock him for producing essentially the same film just with slightly different characters and plot lines. His style of jokes has been called childish and many brand him as lazy. Knowing what hooks audiences in and being unwilling to change his style of films. - [Reporter] What research did you do for your role? - Zero. - [Reporter] Nothing? - The Sandman would just wake up, show up on the set. They'd throw these tight pants on me. I'd stumble out there drunk, throw a ball. And then they put me back in my trailer. - [Narrator] However, harsh the critics may be, Sandler's confidence is not knocked by this. - [Reporter] Does it matter what the critics say? Do you care about that? - You know, it doesn't matter that much to me. I know what they're gonna say every movie. They're gonna say they don't like it. So it's... we'll be okay. I believe in my stuff, that's important to me. And my friends and the people I make the movies for. I like 'em. That's the good news. - [Narrator] His family life also evolved in this time with Sandler and his wife, Jackie welcoming a daughter, Sadie, in 2006. In 2008, Adam Sandler produced and starred in "You Don't Mess With The Zohan," a comedy about a soldier who fakes his own death to pursue his dreams of becoming a hairstylist in New York City. - My guy is a soldier. He's an Israeli soldier who's been fighting for many years. He has borderline super powers as a soldier. And he's just kinda tired of fighting and wants peace in his life, and has a secret dream of wanting to cut hair. And he's embarrassed to tell anybody that. So anyways, they won't let him out of the army because they need him too much. And he decides to fake his own death and he goes over to America and starts cutting hair. And he wants to work with Paul Mitchell, but he can't get a job there. So he starts working at a crappy salon. And the salon is owned by a Palestinian girl. And it's kind of a "West Side Story" thing. - They fall for each other, but they know that they can't be together. - Well, I did think that it was out there, but I also kind of laughed and went, "You'd be funny doing that." And Adam had this idea about eight years ago, and I kept quietly cheerleading this like, "You know what you gotta to do next? Israeli hairdresser." - [Interviewer] so this is all your fault, basically? - Maybe. But then when it came down time to really doing it, and they wanted me to play the Palestinian cab driver, I had to work at this one. I didn't really relax for a while. 'Cause it's not just getting the accent and speaking, Aramaic. I had to learn... I mean I had makeup and everything, and then just be comfortable in it. So it did take some work, that honestly took some work this time. It was fun, but you know, Adam got to go on set like that. For me, it was like four hours. He'd come visit me two hours into makeup. And he'd go, "Okay, see you in two hours." (laughs) - I did have an Israeli guy who used to cut my hair. A really nice guy named Yuki. And he used to talk, I used to ask him questions about the Israeli army. And while he was discussing the Israeli army and machine guns and all this stuff, he'd also be combing my hair and fluffing it up and stuff. So I just thought it was funny to see a guy talk about macho things and have to put conditioner on my head. - [Narrator] Sandler wrote the script in 2000, but after the events of 9/11 the production team decided to wait a while before returning to the project. - [Interviewer] 'Cause you do handle incredibly sensitively issues in this film. - Yeah. So it came to that. You know, I didn't think that all the way through, I called my friends up and said, "What do you think of an Israeli commando guy becoming a hairstylist?" And we all laughed. And then we were writing the movie, we're like, "Oh man, we got to talk about a lot of heavy stuff," but we try to make it as funny as possible. And also the message at the end of the movie's a pretty obvious thing, it would be nice if we got along. So, we knew eventually we were getting to a nice message just it was ugly to get there. - [Interviewer] Some people would say, it's not such a good idea to handle such sensitive issues in a comedy format. - Right, right. - [Interviewer] Presumably you disagree. (giggles) - I guess so. Maybe if I wasn't in it, I'd watch it and go, "Hey, I hate these guys." Because I'm in it, I'm going to have to stick up for it. (chuckles) - Did you worry about offending people? - Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I did, but I just thought it was silly enough. It's silly, it's approached in a silly way and, yeah, there's very serious... People who've lost family to these situations, there's no way they're ever going to laugh at it. Yeah, it was on my mind, but I just wanted to make light of a situation maybe that can be a way to at least talk about it. - [Narrator] "You Don't Mess With The Zohan" got a pretty weak critical reception, with reviews noting it featured a lot of laughs, but eventually the premise wears thin. - [Interviewer] Have people being positive to you about it? - Yeah, but that's usually how it goes. (interviewer laughs) People walk up to me, they're not going to jump right on why they can't stand my movies. Usually they're polite. But I think it's getting, if anyone has a problem with it, that wasn't the intention of it. The intention was to make you laugh. And also just, I don't know, see these Israelis and Palestinians as people and not just saying, "Bad guys, bad guys," people fighting and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The film grossed $38 million on its opening weekend and Time magazine, and The Chicago Sun Times gave the film three out of four stars. 2008 also saw the release of "Bedtime Stories," starring Adam Sandler in his first real appearance in a family oriented film. His daughter Sadie made her first onscreen debut in this film, at the tender age of two. - He gets to know his nephew and niece a lot better. The stories help him just, become a child again. I think he's a little bitter because his dreams aren't coming true. And then it brings back the old stories that his dad used to tell him, and that kind of thing. - [Narrator] Adam Sandler's company, Happy Madison Productions, teamed up with Gunn Films and Walt Disney to produce the film. - It's a good time. I like kids, they're usually pretty fun to hang with. They make me feel smarter. I liked Russell Brand was a good guy to hang with. Keri Russell, a 10, great girl. Nothing wrong with this movie. - [Narrator] Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics, it was a box office success after earning $212.9 million, against its $80 million budget. - Yeah, I think it's a nice little escape. It's a cool movie. It's nice for families, and there's enough jokes in there to make people laugh. And I like it a lot. - Adam and Jackie Sandler also welcomed their second child, Sonny in 2008. - I love my daddy. - I love you too. You guys are my buddies. I love you more than anything in the world. All right, and I just want to say- - I love my daddy. - Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, you did good. - [Narrator] In 2010, Adam Sandler, along with his close friends, Kevin James, David Spade, Chris Rock, and Rob Schneider all starred in the family comedy "Grown Ups." - [Reporter] Now, you worked with a cool group of friends, people that work on "Saturday Night Live." How important for you is it to work with these people on a regular basis? - They're the only people who actually like me, that's why I stick around with 'em. And I think they feel the same about me. Not too many people like any of us. - [Reporter] That's not true though. - No, it's not, just we do okay. - [Narrator] His daughter Sadie also appeared in this film, making it apparent that Sandler wanted his children to accompany him on set. - [Interviewer] Are there other children as well, or is it just your guys? - I was the only one who was psychotic enough to put my kids in the movie. these guys would say, "Why would I do that?" and I was like (mumbles). - [Chris] I said, "Why would you put them in?" he goes, "Because they're talented." (Adam laughs) - [Narrator] The film's plot tells a story of five lifelong friends who won their high school basketball championship in 1978. They reunite three decades later for a 4th of July weekend, after learning about the sudden death of their basketball coach. - I just wanted to make a movie about old friends. And I knew that we all were pretty darn tight in real life, that it made sense. So it was about just catching up and seeing that life doesn't change that much. - [Narrator] Despite receiving generally unfavorable reviews from critics, it grossed $271 million and led to a sequel, "Grown Ups 2," in 2013. After a mass amount of negative reviews linked with his films, Sandler began becoming choosy about the press interviews he did, and which reporters he would speak to, leaving some worried he would be disengaged with his fans. At the beginning of 2011, Adam Sandler was honored with a Hollywood star on the Walk of Fame for his career, in which his films had grossed more than $3 billion worldwide at that time. on February 1st 2011, the star was unveiled outside of the W Hotel. Sandler was shocked, but honored to receive the star with his close friends, Kevin James, and co-star from "The water Boy," Henry Winkler. - It is no mistake that we are standing here to celebrate Adam. - Yes, sir. - I met Adam on the phone the first time when I called to say how happy I was to be in the Hanukkah song. (crowd laughs) And the next time we met was on the set of "The water Boy." - Yes, sir. (crowd cheers) - But the fact of the matter is that what you don't know is that this man standing here is not just a wonderful son, an incredible husband, a loving father, a producer, a writer, and an actor, and a loyal, loyal friend. He is also dedicated to the people that helped him get here, his fans. (crowd cheers) We are here on Hollywood Boulevard.

(crowd cheers) - I really, my friends who are here today, I want to thank them so much. They always back me up a hundred percent and make sure I accomplish whatever I set out to do. It's been a nice, just a great ride. I started off, I worked hard as a comedian, then I got on TV, then I got into movies, and then I've really been getting to do... Just so many people come out here with the same dreams that I had and somehow I'm getting to do them and I really appreciate it. And then... (laughs) I love you. You wanna say something? Say "Dadda." Okay, you'll do it later. So anyways, I want to thank everybody here. Sony Pictures has helped me throughout my whole career too, has backed me up. Thank you to Sony. I think they even bought this star for me, so thank you. - I mean, let's hear it for the man who employs half this town. What do you say, huh? (crowd cheers) Really? What a, what a, what a list of accomplishments. - That was absolutely incredible, really. - I gotta say, though, a lot of those things you kind of knew about Adam. You knew all the movies he's done and everything. I'd like to share with you, maybe a couple of things you don't know about Adam, that would be good. Here's one, we not only share a deep friendship and a great working relationship, we also share the same plastic surgeon. Well, now people need to understand, when your face is your fortune, you do whatever it takes to stay on top. Adam, I want to thank you for introducing me to Dr. Manboobian and all the fine people over at Beverly Hills Rejuvenation, thank you, it's been a wonderful ride. It's been a wonderful ride. Here are some other tidbits about Adam that you may not know. His middle name is Richard. I think a lot of people actually knew that, right? - No, I don't know. - Did he say that? Did he say that his middle name is Richard? He's got two beautiful daughters, you knew that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, well behaved. - Oh, here's one. Adam is a huge star, I mean, he is huge, and he's on a first name basis with people like Sting, Bono, and Oprah. (crowd laughs) I didn't know this. He created the game show, "Tic Tac Dough." He also created the five second rule for when you drop food on the floor, but can still eat it. Thank you. - Well, if my words fall short, know this, there is no greater tribute I can pay you than the fact that I am wearing slacks. I don't wear slacks for anyone except the people I love. And court appearances. (crowd laughs) Adam, I love you, buddy. - I love you. (crowd cheers) - This is a big deal. I really feel honored. I can't believe this happened in my life. I did come out here when I was very young. I was a kid, I was growing up. I had an amazing mom. I had an amazing dad, brothers and sisters. My brother and my two sisters. All they ever did was make me feel like I'm good at things. And even when I was terrible at things, they were like, "You're so remarkable, Adam, you're great." Anything I did, I sang in the car, "What a great singer. You're so funny." Just, they instilled me with confidence. So much so that I thought I could be a pro baseball player until my father said, "You're too slow." But that was when I was 11. Then I had to just go, "All right, maybe a comedian." But I love my family very much. And they made it a point, the whole family was always about our family. My parents always made me feel very like there was nothing else, but me and my brother and two sisters. So I just wanted to thank my mom, and my father, who's watching down I'm sure. He'd be very excited about this. (crowd cheers) I love you. I love you guys. I love you, Val. Love my sister at home, Liz, and Scott. And all their kids, Tyler, Jared, Victoria, Jillian. They're all smart kids. And, I gotta say, one of the greatest things that's ever happened to me, coming out to Hollywood, setting out to do what I'm doing, I got to meet my wife. You hear me, my wife? I got to meet my wife, who I love very much. If I wasn't pursuing this career, I wouldn't be out here, I wouldn't have met her, I wouldn't have had these great kids. I wouldn't have felt as good as I feel about my life every day. I do love her very much. I love that my kids are not hearing a word of this.

I'm gonna sign the papers in a couple of days and- - Okay, I just need to hear it from her. - You wanna, w-what do you mean? - I need to meet her. - How 'bout if she texts you, would that be good? - I cannot believe I'm doing this. - I want to create the illusion I had a hot first wife, not this. - Okay, come on, let's go. - Is that her? - Hello, boring. - Why you wearing that? - I'm just, uh, playing the part. - [Narrator] Also in 2011, Sandler starred in "Jack and Jill," a comedy film in which he played both starring roles of Jack and his annoying twin sister, Jill.

(gentle music) 2012 saw Adam Sandler spend some time off screen when he voiced a character for the animated film "Hotel Transylvania." Sandler also got his youngest daughter, Sonny, a voiceover role in the film. - [Interviewer] No, you know, you always sort of have the same cast of characters, whether it's in your films, now in animated films, what is it about these guys that just makes you always wanna work with them, Continue to work with them? - They're just very funny guys. I just love being around 'em, and we have a good time together. - [Interviewer] And what was the best part of working on this animated film? I know you're not in front of the camera. - Listen, yeah, we worked hard. Me and my friends worked with this guy, Genndy, for about a year and a half or two. It took a lot of our time, but just knowing that my kids were going to have a good time watching. That's all that was exciting to me. - [Interviewer] Now, you and Adam are no stranger to working together. What is it about the partnership that continues to make you guys wanna collaborate, whether it's on film or these animated projects? - He makes me laugh, you know what I mean? We just laugh. We laugh together all the time. We have a great relationship. We just click, our families get together. We have the same sensibility. And I'm always honored to do stuff with him, and wanna work with him. So, when he thinks of me to put me in any of his movies, I'm thrilled and it's great. You know you're going to feel comfortable, it's like seeing your family again and working with your family. So you can mess up, you can have fun, you can try stuff. - [Narrator] The children's movie was popular enough to earn two more sequels, in 2015 and 2018, in which Sandler reprised his role as count Dracula. (upbeat music) The Sequel to Sandler's own film, "Grown Ups" premiered in 2013, with critics calling it unnecessary. However, at this point in his career, Sandler was used to the negative backlash towards his films and was not phased by the reports. Sandler's 2014 film "Blended" saw his third collaboration with actress Drew Barrymore. The romantic comedy revolves around Sandler and Barrymore finding themselves together at a holiday resort after an unsuccessful blind date, where the attraction between them grows, and their kids, benefit from the blooming relationship. - Hello everybody. - [Brendan] This is very cool, Mom. What the fudge is he doing here? - Is this a sick dream? - Do I have a new mommy? - Isn't this place fantastic? So romantic. - We are not dating. - My mom is frigging hot. - Ew. - No, not hot. - That's just wrong. - This is so pretty. Wow. - Oh. We're out of gas! - What? - Start. - [Narrator] Although the film received mainly negative reviews, the positive support from fans earned the movie mixed ratings across platforms and made it a box office success. Based on the amount of films Happy Madison Productions has produced. Adam Sandler was offered a deal with Netflix in 2014 to write and produce films for the streaming platform. - [Journalist] I want to know, why did you decide to have this close relationship with Netflix, and how is working with them? - They've been great to me. And they've just allowed me to be free creatively. And it was just really close with Ted Sarandos and the whole team. It's an exciting place to be right now for me, the enthusiasm is gigantic. - [Narrator] His first Netflix release came in 2015, the western comedy, "The Ridiculous Six." Though the movie was panned by the critics, Netflix said that the movie had received an impressive number of views within the first 30 days of its release. Sandler went on to produce five more movies for the streaming giant, such as "The Do-Over" and "Sandy Wexler." His film, "The Meyerowitz Stories," released in 2017, received positive reviews. - We both had, and Ben, and Elizabeth Marvel, and everybody in the movie has amazing dialog. And Noah Baumbach, his other movies are insane, I love 'em. And then he sent this script, and I think it was unanimous, except for this guy, we had to win him over. We were all pretty away with just the story and the words. - From watching what Ben and Noah have done, I was excited no matter what, because I loved those movies. But the fact that he wrote this script, and what all our characters did, and what the story was. That wasn't why I wanted to work with them, the fact that it ended up being this movie was quite a bonus, how great I thought that script was and getting to see Noah shoot and being a part of it. - They're just such terrific actors. I think in some ways, because they both, they gave over so strongly to both their characters, it creates a kind of intimacy that you feel when you watch the movie. I think it also doesn't hurt that they've known each other a long time and never really worked together. They did a small thing in Happy Gilmore, but this is their first movie where they're really both in it for the whole thing. And I think there was something exciting for them too. And I think they saw it as a challenge that they wanted to do great work. - I would say that the dad's... Your character, - I'm whooping you. - You are. You are, for sure. - You're definitely getting in the way. You're trying to ruin what I have. Well, I'm just trying- - Butting in. - I mean, I do feel it's interesting, both characters have their own things that they need to... I don't know, they have to grow, they both have to grow, right? And you have dedicated yourself to your daughter, but in a way, they're things that you've sub... - Yeah. - What is it, sub? - Scared of. - Jugated, or something. - Yeah. - Yeah. So I feel like, I mean, you can make money, it doesn't make you a success. - Oh no. - I think, being content in your life or feeling good about yourself as a person, or- - Does anybody really feel that? I got to get to that. - This is getting so deep. - Loved it. I mean, me and Ben, know each other forever, and it's been a very long time since we worked together. This was great to see him everyday, and do hard work with him. And we both loved the script so much. We didn't want to let Noah down, but we both feel the same about being with Hoffman. It's an honor. And it's something as a kid you would not believe, that one day you'd be making movies with that guy who is one of the best, if not the best. - I mean, Dustin, I'd walk over broken glass to work with any time, 'cause we're sort of joined at the hip and this is our third time. So that was heaven. Adam and Ben were a joy to work with, because they were slightly out of their comfort zone. So they were doing serious roles. And I was an outsider, and playing an outsider. - [Narrator] The comedy drama was released in select theaters and on Netflix in October of that year. And follows a group of dysfunctional siblings trying to live in the shadow of their father. - Well, the interesting thing I think is that we all love each other very much and we can't stand being with each other. (reporter laughs) - Yes, yes. (reporter) - and that's real life. - Yes. - "It's what you do," is what my sister in the movie says. It's something like, "Dad's so mean and blah, blah, blah. And he never treats you right, why are you here right now?" And she's like, "It's what you do." It's what you do as a kid, what you do as a parent, even when there's something that's not clicking, you're always trying to make it work. - [Woman] Are you Harold Meyerowitz's son, Matthew?" - Yes. - And this is Danny, also Harold Meyerowitz's son. - I didn't realize he had two sons. - And a daughter - Dad, it'll be okay here. - It'll be nice to spend time with Dad. You know, I didn't get a lot of time with him growing up. - Son of a bitch. (cue cracks) ♪ Well, once we had an easy ride and always felt the same ♪ - Dad, what the fuck? - [Reporter] This film has a real all-star cast. It's not just you two, it's Emma Thompson, it's Ben Stiller. - Yes. - [Reporter] That must have been just so much fun to film, right? - Oh yeah. - Yes. But we would have preferred it if it was just us. (Adam laughs) - They just kept showing up. And I was like, "Just put a camera on them and let them do their thing." - They hadn't worked in a long time. (they laugh) - It was just luck that this guy wrote an amazing movie and handed it to me and said, "Would you like to be in it?" That was the best part of it. I read it and knew it was a great movie and just didn't wanna let Noah down, and worked hard, and that's it. - As we were saying, we all prepared a lot and talked a lot, and as a director, in many ways, part of your job is to see the actor and see what they're doing and help guide them. But with the best actors there's this other thing going on that is out of your control, in the best possible way, because they're they're drawing something from inside them that's a mystery. And it might even be a mystery to them in some way too. But Adam connected to something very deeply in this guy, it's something we haven't even talked about that much, but I would marvel throughout the shoot at just how true and unacted it seemed. It was behavior, and it was deep. It was very moving to me. - When we started the film, and I was doing stuff with Adam. And also there were things he was doing with other people, but I happen to be on the set, and I observed it, Noah uses the word deep. And I think what that means is, this is my personal feeling, I don't think actors should play parts unless they're in it. Otherwise it looks like they're performing a part. "Oh, well so, and so is an asshole, but I'm not an asshole, so I'll just perform an asshole. I'll just get a few people in my head that I know are real people that are assholes, and I'll just do that." I think we have the asshole in us, all of us. And it's up to us to enlarge on that. And I thought what Adam was doing, 'cause I couldn't put it into words, I agree with Noah, there was something about him that I had not seen before. And I know him and I had done another film with him. And I went home and I said to my wife, I said, "I think Adam has hit a part of himself in which he would be the person that didn't make it." And that's as close as you can get to the bone. And I thought that's what Adam was doing, to hit that. 'Cause we can, we all can. - [Narrator] Adam Sandler was especially singled out for praise by critics, which was a breath of fresh air for the actor, considering his past negative reviews. The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, but sparked controversy, as it was a film made for online streaming and not the big screen. - [Reporter] But it caused a bit of controversy in Cannes, right? The Netflix logo was booed in one of the screenings. Were you surprised by that? - But it wasn't our film. - It took a minute to get used to there. It got some noise the first night. And then the movie was such a great movie, people relaxed. And then ours came up and they were a little calmer with it. And we were glad they calmed down. - We got a five minute standing ovation. - Yeah - Yes. - [Reporter] It is a great film. - You heard that? Did you hear that? - Yes. - I did hear about the standing ovation afterwards. - Say six minutes then, it sounds a little... - it was a six and a half minute standing ovation. - Felt good, standing that long. It was good for the calves. - [Narrator] In 2019, Adam Sandler produced "Uncut Gems" and "Murder Mystery" for streaming giant Netflix. - Do you know how that makes me feel? - Never resurface anything. - You think your life is more important than mine? - I don't know who said that. (dramatic music) - [Howard] I told you about how things were gonna go. You like the way things are going now? - [Howard] That's my family. Get the kids out of the house. - You having a good time. - Yes. - This was like a 10 year project. But the impetus originally, the original impetus was inspired by our dad's time working in the diamond district. And his stories that he would tell, you'd always be on the edge of your seat, listening to him. Like, "Well, what did you do next? What did you do then? What do you mean, they poked your tire? You knew they were following you so you didn't pull over?" He was like, "I couldn't pull over, They were going to kill me." So it's like the stories kept you on the edge, but there were also comedic and ridiculous. Like, "They did that?" Then you start doing the research in the diamond district and there's this energy there, in the diamond district, where it's just the people have gamble, on top of gamble, on top of gamble. And there's seven different things happening at once. And you're trying to pay attention and all, but it's just, it's alive. You know what I mean? - And the myth of this Howard character, was something that it's kind of incredible to see him exist now in this new universe. - So I do think that we knew that we wanted to do a thriller. We knew that it was going to be a thriller, and I like the idea of form following function. So if you're going to tell a thriller, it better be thrilling. And how much more thrilling could we have made this movie? - Being Howard Ratner was a good feeling. It was fun going through what he went through and diving in with him and trying to be that guy. And I loved it. - Sandler such a unique person. And it's great when you meet a star and they are unique, you know what I mean? And he's unique because he's so himself, you know what I mean? And he's so grounded, and he's such a good person. But he's also, again, nuts, in the greatest way possible, you know what I mean? His humor is amazingly strange and I loved it. We've loved it forever. Forever, since we were little kids, that was the first thing we learned from, was through his humor. And then of course the movies are just these iconic things. But I think that getting to know him on a personal level and see the work that he put into this. There's people who prepare for roles and there's people who just enter the roles, and he did both at the same time. And that was amazing to see. In the edit I would sit there and just watch the closeups to see all these little micro decisions. And now I watched the movie and he's just Howard, He's not Adam Sandler. - Which is- - he's just Howard. - He said something where he's like, 'cause the way we would shoot the film he didn't know what his closeup was. So he would just be on that level the whole time. Yes, even in the wides. Even when he wasn't on camera. - [Interviewer] Just that level? - Yeah. - Yeah, he didn't know, he was just like, "Well, what are we shooting now?" I was just like, "Don't worry about it." - [Narrator] "Murder Mystery" saw Sandler reunite with Jennifer Anniston for a comedy drama, which Netflix stated was their most watched film of 2019 on their U.S. platform, and had the biggest opening weekend for a film on their platform. - Twisted my arm, barely, not even a little bit. It's just, how do you say no to that? He says "Please" And you say, yes. - You're going to love the mystery. I have to pay homage to the mystery. It works, and it's, it's a fun watch. You're going to love the locations, because it's very picturesque and beautiful. You're going to love the adventure. You're going to love the idea of going to a distant place and maybe getting wrapped up in something crazy. - [Narrator] The film revolves around Sandler and Aniston, a married couple that get caught up in a murder mystery on a billionaire's yacht. - My name is Inspector Laurent de la Croix. I will now summon you for questioning. - Why is that smoke ring so good, how did he do that? - Did you notice anything out of the ordinary. - [All Together] The Americans. - But we didn't do this. - [Nick] Someone's trying to frame us. - We do things together. So can we please just figure this out? (gun fires) It's just like "Death in The Library." - What happens in "Death in The Library?" - They died. It's why it's called "Death in The Library." (gun fires) (Audrey screams) You know, we were from Brooklyn and fish out of water. And they were all sort of upper crusted, wealthy people who all had a motive into offing the man who was offed. So it just was part of the story. - It was all Jen saying, "We have to do something together. I can't be apart this long. You're an amazing human. I feel so sick to my stomach when you're not near me." So I said, "Let me just make a movie with you, so you can relax." - On a personal level, it was hard to believe that I was directing Adam Sandler after watching so many Adam Sandler movies before I was a professional director. So in that respect, I had to pinch myself pretty much every day, but Sandler's so down to earth that he just felt like we had been friends for a long time. There was a couple times where I found myself quoting his movies on set. Not because he was there, but just because it's in my DNA as a person. And he would hear me and I was like, "Is it okay to... Can I do that?" And he's like, "Yeah." And he likes it. So he's just a real person that was awesome to work with. - My two daughters always pop in my movies. - My wife, she's funny in the movie, she's a flight attendant, we had a nice couple of scenes together, it was great. - [Narrator] The film received average reviews, meaning Sandler didn't face much negative backlash. Adam Sandler also created a comedy special, sarcastically titled 100% fresh for Netflix. This was to preempt the negative reviews. However, it was favored by critics and highly recommended. Due to the popularity of the six films Happy Madison Productions had made for Netflix, Adam Sandler signed a further deal with the streaming platform in January, 2020, confirming he would produce a further four films for the company. - You signed a multi-movie deal with Netflix. You must think it's the future of cinema. - That, and the fact that they liked me so much feels nice. It's a combination. I think they've been great to me. And they also say I'm wonderful, and that feels nice. - [Narrator] Despite the critical backlash he has faced throughout his career so far, Adam Sandler has always had a solid fan base behind him supporting all his productions and pushing his career further. - [Reporter] Obviously your films are, as you said, proving hugely popular still on Netflix. Does it matter what the critics say? Do you care about that? - It doesn't matter that much to me. I know what they're gonna say every movie, they're going to say they don't like it. We'll be okay. I believe in my stuff, that's important to me. and my friends and the people I make the movies for, I like 'em. That's the good news. - [Reporter] Do you think in the past, critics have been too harsh on his films? - I don't care about critics. You know what, John Cleese said said the best thing to me, since you're from the UK, John Cleese, my real hero, the funniest big man, who ever lived. funniest guy, and a great writer, but Cleese said the best thing about critics. He said, "Critics, don't even ignore them." I'll take it to my grave. Thank you. Ah, who cares? I'll take criticism from somebody who does the same thing we're doing, trying to write, produce direct and make movies and star in movies and deal with all this. Let's see them do it. And then I'll listen to what they have to say. - Working with Adam Sandler was definitely, probably, one of the best experiences I've ever had in my career. And I got to learn so much from him. Mostly working side by side with him, watching him be the director and the actor, and pull it all together. So it was a great learning experience too. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Most of his fans fell in love with the actor from his early career, starring and "Happy Gilmore" and "The Water Boy."

Making movies for Netflix makes his productions more accessible to a wider audience. And will definitely keep him popular. (gentle music) Despite a career filled with fluctuating reviews from critics and films that didn't quite meet their box office budgets, Adam Sandler has managed to survive the storm and come out on top, proving his title is a fan favorite is here to stay. - [Interviewer] What's the best part about being successful and/or famous? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't think about that. I'm just happy to be working. - [Narrator] Everyone knows of at least one Happy Madison film and the actor is a household name who keeps bringing laughs to our living rooms. - On set he's so nice, and so welcoming, it makes you feel very comfortable. There's no room for you to be nervous. Because he's just making jokes, or trying to think of other ways to make the scene work. - And I feel like we've got a lot in common. He's nicer than me. - No, just we have a thing that, I think we share some sort of mutual subset of- - Loving of our parents too. - Yes. - [Narrator] Adam Sandler is at the height of his career, and with a new Netflix deal and filmography that just keeps growing, audiences are awaiting the arrival of his next lovable character.
