EMMETT LIQUID CONDOM Thank you. Thanks for shopping with us, sir. We're thirty seconds behind our scheduled time. - You're obsessed with time. - Not just with time. Fortunately. I have to show you the schedule I made based on three years ago. It's...a masterpiece. Diego, re-living the weekend when we first met... isn't going to solve our problems. Yes it will, you'll see. Trust me. PEACHES - I'll bet you didn't call, Diego. - Of course I called. But they didn't pick up. They didn't pick up. Yeah, and this might be the reason. Well, I still love this place. - Seriously ? - Yup. I remember everything perfectly. Don't you remember that we ate there ? I got a smile out of you over there. And there I ripped off your dress. - I'm going to the car. - No, where are you going ? - To the beach, it's not far away. - We can't go to the beach now. I made the schedule based on three years ago, and now we have to... Laura, no ! Laura ! Laura ! - This is not happening. - No, you have to lift up the... - Anyway... - Shit ! Laura, the car isn't starting, and we're already here. Therefore, let's try and take advantage of this opportunity to the fullest. If you stay here, you won't be able to do anything interesting. Did you enjoy that ? - We're behind by three minutes. - Diego... But I'm not complaining, Laura, no complaints. Who is it ? SANDRO Laura we agreed this was our weekend. - Yeah, but what if it's important ? - OK then. Where are you going ? To save our relationship. What are you doing ? I can't find the key. What key ? Our key, the one for the Roman cabin. Diego, with all those keys, you're really worried about finding the key to the Roman cabin ? It's open, Laura. Laura ? Well ? Welcome to the cabin of love. Let's break this bed apart. - Dear god... - Hey, hey ! Wait. - I'll clean it up. - Why can't we go to another one ? I'll leave it like new, I promise. Look, you can't just schedule everything in life. I have only scheduled two things, which are my alarm clock and my period, and believe me, both of them kind of suck. OK. You can't have everything scheduled. - Don't do that. - Relax, I have a copy. The thing is, we can do whatever you want. - How many copies did you bring ? - There are none left. It's the last one, I swear. None more. Fine, there's one more. If it makes you happy, I'll rip it up. Diego, for once in your life, surprise me. OK. The perfect song. READY The perfect food. Who needs a chef when the Emmett Gastro- Printer... can make you the finest cuisine ? READY So, is technology here to make life easier or what ? Wine ? Sorry. You go dry off and I'll prepare the cabin. Laura ? The cabin is clean, the bed is clean, your man is clean, and he's going to clean you up with some strong licking. Sorry, I'll be inside. You always say I'm very square, right ? Fine. I brought some fantasy elements for our anniversary. So, for example, a pair of handcuffs to tie you to the bed. Handcuffs ? If you don't like them, you can use them on me. I also brought a leather whip for when you're naughty. And if you don't like it, you can use it on me. And I also brought Pepe. And if you don't like it, we can leave it in the suitcase. But best of all is... This. - What is it ? - This... Is the most stimulating thing in your life. Diego, I'm not wearing that down there. SEXOTRON EMMETT No, it's something I've been working on at Emmett. We call this the Sexotron... though I prefer to call it by its scientific name, the External Limbic System. With these on, we'll be able to relive this experience, completely and exactly. Every detail, every sensation, every orgasm. We can re-play it, pause it, or make it last longer. Happy anniversary, baby. Well, I brought you a lighter. Let's go. - Diego, get it off, get it off me ! - It's not hot, not hot. Shit ! - What's wrong ? - Nothing, let me see... Shit ! Shit ! No. Oh no... No... Lauri ! My love, why don't you answer my calls ? What are you doing here, Sandro ? You left all your clothes drying on the laundry line. You drove three hours just to tell me that ? How the hell did he know we were here ? What's up, my man ? When love is strong, and real, it always finds a way... Our cell phones are linked via GPS so we now where the other is. Really ? And when did we activate that ? When we met at the Olympics, my love. She told you I'm an Olympic athlete, right ? Sandro, we broke up four years ago, this has to stop, now. This is unbelievable, every single time, he's always disturbing us... Chill out, chill out. My love, since it was just your birthday, I bought you that bifurcated dildo you liked so much. The other one got destroyed from so much use. Look, I was going through an experimental phase, and well... That's just peachy. Be careful with what you say, remember, I'm an Olympic athlete. Yeah, in synchronized swimming, stupid idiot ! Lauri, you need to be with an athlete, a man that makes you feel, for real. Look Sandro, size isn't the only thing that matters. - Have you talked about my penis size ? - What ? No, well, yes... I'm going to shove that dildo up your ass, asshole ! Come on ! Come on, yeah ! - Do not hit me with the dildo. - You like that ? Tonight, with Laura, I'm gonna use it ! Hey, idiots ! - What are you doing ? - Me ? Lauri, Lauri, my love ! Come back to me, you should be with a real man ! Yeah, I'm a lowdown, dirty thief. I've always wanted one of those amazing Emmett cellphones, but I've never worked a day in my life, so I can't afford one. No money ? No problem ! You see that couple over there ? They both own the brand new Emmett Industries Cell Phone 3000. An indispensable tool for all occasions. Camera, photo printer, personal stereo and even a self destructing explosive ! That phone's got it all ! Dammit, I need me one of those sons of bitches ! Gimme your Emmett Cell Phone 3000 ! Come on ! And no funny business ! Now with free jumper accessory, designed to both jumpstart your car and keep you safe ! Other optional add- ons include the caller 3000 accessory, which now enables you to communicate by voice... For a limited time only. This is our opportunity, let's leave him here. We can find a beach, cold beer, a good hotel... Lauri ! Lauri, my love, hey ! We're not going to stay here, right ? Laura ! I don't understand how you can do this, but if you leave with him, I'll kill myself. Right here and now, I'll set myself on fire. Don't laugh ! That's champagne ! Champagne ? This is, 20% alcohol Laura, so it's flammable, at least a little. - Really ? - What are you doing ? He tried to set me on fire ! He wants to kill me ! You want to go with him ? With this fucking Olympic athlete ? What are you doing ? The jacket is fireproof, jackass. You want to leave with this walking cock ? - Thanks for the cock-thing, eh ! - Right then. Go with him ! Diego ! Laura, my love. Hey, come on, you don't deserve the way that lunatic treats you... The car doesn't work, can you take me to the bus stop, please ? Yes, wherever you want, I'll swim you to Punta del Este if you wish... - No, the bus stop will be fine. - We'll talk about it on the way. SEXOTRAVEL Hello, Laura, it's me, I know you don't want to speak to me, I acted like an idiot, but I'm asking you for one last chance. I'll wait for you at the motel. And two things. Bring the same dress you wore yesterday, I'll tell you why when you get here. Diego ! Where are you ? Diego ? Diego ? - You look different. - Different ? You look calmer. I want us to try it again. Our moment has passed. Why ? - Have you gone back to Sandro ? - What ? I did so much, it was the perfect weekend, everything was planned. You're the one that pushed me back to Sandro. - You must come with me. - No. It was your last chance. And you let it get away. What if I told you we could get our moment back, what would you say ? That I'm fed up. - Just wait here. - Where are you going ? Do you think we can be together again ? It seems complicated. Let me try. The other day I thought it hadn't worked, but it had. It's not that I miscalculated, something else happened. - Do you know what's best about me ? - Your modesty. My ability to reason. I discovered that we recorded something on this memory disk. You can't travel without opening a breach, and that's exactly what we did. We bought a ticket to travel in time. I'd say you bought a ticket to travel to an asylum, Diego. Strap this on and prepare for the trip ! Have you peed before leaving ? Because you should always go pee before a trip. Sorry. Where are we going ? To the start of our weekend. Why would you want to re-live it ? It was a disaster. No, I don't want to re-live it, I want to change it. Of course I called, but they didn't pick up. They didn't pick up. Yeah, and this might be the reason. I can't believe this. Is it incredible or is it not incredible ? Do you think that dress makes me look fat ? We're the first people ever to go back in time... and you're worried that a dress makes you look fat ? Very, very fat. Why didn't you tell me ? I think you look fine. - Where are you going ? - To the beach. - It's not so far away. - We can't go to the beach now. I made the schedule based on three years ago, and now we have to... It was supposed to be the perfect weekend. Yeah, but it wasn't. No, no it wasn't, but this time it will be, this time it will be, because this time I'm going to electrocute Sandro with the taser, so you'll be alone with me and... You really only came back to the past just to electrocute Sandro ? Actually, I'd like to rip his balls off, but I'm not going to do it, it would be too much. - I'm going to the car. - Laura, Laura ! Laura, not this time, this time let me show you what I have planned. I recovered the schedule, don't get angry, but I've made improvements. Let's do it all again, but this time, we'll do it right. We can eat, then 22 minutes later we have sex, a nap, we wake up, play some Trivial pursuit, sex again... it may seem like a lot of sex, but it's to strengthen our relationship. Of course, sure. Then, the beach, it's on the schedule, you and I. Now we need to have sex in that cabin. - What a coincidence. - No, it says it here. I don't want to see the stupid schedule, really. Ok. It's open, Laura. Laura ! - Stay there ! - Laura ? No no no, Laura ! Lau... What ? Welcome to the cabin of love. Let's break this bed apart. - Dear god... - Wait, wait, I'll clean it up. Shit, shit, shit ! Think. Diego ! Laura ? Laura. Shit. - Where are we going ? - You'll see. For once in your life, surprise me. All that fuss with the Roman cabin and now nothing ? Didn't you want me to improvise ? I'm very good at improvising. Yeah ? I found this in the car. Some additional notes for the weekend by Diego Talavera. These are just some thoughts that came to me suddenly. From the moment of penetration, start off in missionary position and stay there for two minutes exactly. Important: do not ejaculate for at least two minutes. Ok, fine. At least I recognize my limitations. I assure you, those two minutes will be unforgettable. Look Diego, I know this is super-important to you. Take me to whatever cabin you like, Ok ? We'll use something to slow things down. Let's go ! Well. Well, well ! It's not the Roman cabin, but you wanted new experiences. So there you go ! It's very romantic. And what's this for ? Would you like me to put this in my mouth ? - You like it ? - That goes in your butt. - Sick ! - I'm going to get some water. Sorry. You go dry off and I'll prepare the cabin. Let's go, now's our chance. - You say that, because... - It's me, the real one. - Were you going to sleep with her ? - What ? No, no. Yes, you were, yes. No, no, I was not going to sleep with her. Besides, it would be doing it with you. Laura ? The cabin is clean, the bed is clean, your man is clean, and he's going to clean you up with some strong licking. Hygiene is very important. Seeing things from here, it sounds even more ridiculous. Stop inflating my ego. But, it arouses me. - Really ? - Perhaps I should sleep with him. You with him and her ? No. That's a paradox and it's dangerous. Besides I think a trio like that is illegal. Well, maybe it's not so paradoxical if you and I have a good screw. You and I, you mean you and I. Yeah. Doesn't your schedule cover that ? Yes ! Of course. - Right now ? - Yes. OK. My stuff is in the other cabin, I mention it because... - Whatever, leave it. - Ok. Technically, are we going to do it or have we already done it ? Are you saying that because I'm premature ? You're going to last nothing. Well now, no. Allow me. Son of a bitch ! Look at him. What a cocky jackass ! That's Sandro, an Olympic athlete. You once said he was more athletic in bed. Well let's not talk about that now. We need to talk about this. Sandro's sexual tendencies... were more beast like... more... savage, you know ? More... aggressive. And what are my sexual tendencies, according to you ? Well you, you're much sweeter, more tender... Tender. - Come on, come on ! - Do not hit me with the dildo ! Hey, idiots ! You want something more savage and aggressive ? Ok. I'll give you something more savage and aggressive. Lauri my love ! Come back to me, you should be with a real man ! I'm right here. - You won't fuck up my life again. - You do that on your own ! Diego ! My love, you don't deserve the way that lunatic treats you... Can you take me to the bus stop please ? Yes, wherever you want, I'll swim you to Punta del Este if you like... - The bus stop will be fine. - We'll talk about it on the way. Laura, open the door. Why did you go with him ? I've travelled in time for you, who else would do that ? Who are you ? I'm an improved version of you. More clever, more elegant, more intelligent. - I'm you from the future. - From the future ? And I've worked too hard for you to screw things up. - I have to speak with her. - I already have. You know what I'm going to do ? - Yes, I do. - Return to the present. How ? You still haven't created the time machine. You can't hide her forever. I'll appear when you least expect it. You might have her now but I have the element of surprise. What's that ? Read it. "You can't hide her forever." "I'll appear when you least expect it." Fine. You'll try a few more times and then you'll do something predictable. - You'll travel back to her. - Again ? It worked for me. But she doesn't love you, she's still in love with Sandro. Not anymore. Why not ? - What did you do ? - Watch and learn. That son of a bitch ! ROMANTIC POETRY Is that the brand new Emmett gel ? Romance is dead. Get straight to the point with Emmett's liquid condom. The self hardening contraceptive of the future. Oh yeah ! 10:15 MORNING SEX - Is this sweet and tender ? - Yes, yes... - Wanna know something, Laura ? - Yes, yes... - It's been more than three minutes. - Yes... My record. If I were to have met myself from the past... Yes... I would show him a few things. I'd show him how to be a winner. - If this doesn't work out... - Don't say that. I won't be able to show anyone. - And we want this to end well. - Yes, yes. - We want it to end well, right. - Yes ! Nicely played. Relax, I told you I was here to help. Why did she choose you ? Why are you different from me ? When Sandro got here, I remained calm. I was just there for her. If I were to stay calm ? When Sandro arrives ? Well then, I suppose that would turn you into me. - Have you talked about my penis size ? - What ? No, well, yes... I'm going to shove that dildo up your ass ! So what ? You want more ? Sandro, why are you here and there ? I invented some helmets... to travel through time. You what ? I invented these helmets, you imbecile ! Well, since I travelled in time, I can change the past, you idiot. You haven't got a fucking clue how this works, right Sandro ? Fine. Why did you come back ? Because she came back. And you came back. So I came back. I hate being left out. And she chose you. - So I came to change things. - Lauri ! - Come back to me ! - Laura... - You should be with a real man ! - My sweetheart... My love. My everything. Sandro, Alessandro, Sandro ! - The fuck is this ? - I think you just killed yourself. No, no, this can't be good. No, no. I dreamed of this. Two Sandros. One Laura. Infinite sexual positions. You'd just love to fuck yourself, huh ? Imagine a hundred mes, eh ? With my mastery of sex. And her... Good luck with that. Laura ? Laura. Where were you ? I'm sorry, I know things aren't turning out right, Laura. Listen to me. This is our chance. Let's take those helmets and leave things here. We can find a beach, a hotel, ice cold beer, just you and I. With me ? You want to hit the beach with me ? Of course, if not you, then who ? You'll be with me, together we'll go out. We'll have orgies... Wait for me at the entrance. I'll take you to the hospital. What are you doing ? Don't you understand what this means ? The only person who can end me... is actually ME. I'm the fucking man ! I'm god ! With half your ego, I'd do phenomenal, man. With half my dick you'd do phenomenal. Come on. Lauri ! Lauri, my love, let's go. Laura ! I was worried. We're trapped, Laura. All this has already happened and will keep happening. There's no way to change the timeline. OK, calm down. I understood it all when Sandro killed himself. Sandro committed suicide ? - No, no, Laura, another Sandro. - I don't follow. Sandro went back in time to get you back. - And to fuck himself, literally. - Ok then, where is he now ? In that duffle bag he had with him in his car. That's where the body of the second Sandro was. The time machine didn't even exist yet. - And what does that mean, exactly ? - That we're trapped. Diego ! Let's go. - And where ? - To the beach. Let's look to the future. Laura open the door. I've travelled in time for you, who else would do that ? I have to speak with him. Who are you ? I'm an improved version of you. More clever, more elegant, more intelligent... - I'm you from the future. - From the future ? And I've worked too hard for you to screw things up. I must speak with her, I have to tell her things. - I already have. - OK, you know what I'm going to do ? - Yes, I do. - Return to the present. How ? You still haven't created the time machine. You can't hide her forever. When you least expect it, that's when I'll appear. You might have her now but I have the element of surprise. - What's that ? - Read it. "You can't hide her forever." "When you least expect it, that's when I'll..." Fine. You'll try a few more times and then you'll do something predictable. You'll travel back to her. - You mean again ? - Well it worked for me. But you know she doesn't love you, she's still in love with Sandro. - Not anymore. - Why not ? - What did you do ? - Watch and learn. - Is he watching us ? - Yup. Well, as soon as he stops, we'll go. No, we can't, the car won't start, remember ? - Shit. - Yep. We have to wait until tomorrow, until they travel back into the past. Then we turn off the machine... and we'll see. - And if things go wrong ? - We'll be fine. We have an advantage, we know what's going to happen. I wish we knew what was going to happen with us. Well, first let's fix this and we'll deal with it later. You know what your problem is ? You want to keep me in a can, just like those peaches of yours. And I need to be free. In every part of this motel there's a Diego trying to get you back. You can accuse me of lots of things, but not of not fighting for you. - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, well, you woke up a little perky this morning, huh ? 10:15 MORNING SEX - Is this sweet and tender ? - Yes. - Yes ? - Yes... - Sweet and tender ? - Yes... Yes ! Nicely played. Relax, I told you I was here to help. Why did she choose you ? Why are you different from me ? When Sandro got here, I remained calm. I was just there for her. If I were to stay calm ? When Sandro arrives, if I were there for her ? Well then, I suppose that would turn you into me. Well. Fine ? OK, great. All we have to do is send the first me into the past and we're done. You should be arriving soon, you called me and I came out. OK. And you should arrive... Now. - Where are you ? - Well, maybe I'll arrive in a bit. No, you're scheduled to arrive in a minute and a half. And that's how everything starts, with you out there. - I don't see anybody there. - Well, maybe... Let's see. If Laura doesn't come, Diego won't travel to the past, and I... Things are going to get fucked up. You have to go there. You have to go there, Laura. - What ? - Until the other you arrives. You have to repeat what you said and it has to be exactly the same. No. Diego, what if he takes me to the past with him ? Impossible, you switch with the other Laura before they go back. When you do that, it'll be just you and me. It's easy. Diego this isn't going to work. - How will I know what to say to him ? - Listen to your heart. And this earphone, I'll tell you from here. Sorry. Let's go. Testing, testing. One, two. Laura can you hear me ? How will I know which is him and which is you ? This isn't going to work. This is the only way we can ensure we'll get him back to the past. - Diego ! Where are you ? - Very good. Diego, where are you ? This is insane. He's coming. Don't move and repeat what I tell you. You seem different. - You seem different. - Different ? Calmer. - Calmer. - I want us to try it again. - Our moment has passed. - Our moment has passed. No one is coming. - You never came. - What ? You didn't come back for me. I sent you to speak with me, but you left with Sandro. You're the one that pushed me back to Sandro. This is a senseless loop. Laura, you have to come back. Laura, listen. It was your last chance. And you let it get away. Laura, listen. If you don't come back now you'll be trapped forever. Do you hear me ? Don't move. I'm tired of this. I'm going to get you, but I need to think something up. A distraction so he doesn't see me. The taser. Laura, you can't go into the past with him, understood ? Do you hear me, Laura ? Shit ! Shit ! Diego ! No, no, no. Not again. - Son of a bitch ! - No. Do you want me to beat you again ? Sandro is dead. I'm so very sorry. I took him to the hospital, but... I buried him in a salt mine. And now I'm here for Laura. But Laura went with you ! - Don't lie ! - Ok. That might have happened in another timeline, but not this one. This is a confluence of the past, present and future in the same space. Do you understand ? - You take me for a stupid asshole ? - No. I can take you to her. - How ? - With my machine. I can create a parallel past where there are other Lauras, other Sandros. - I accept. - Great. You'll arrive close to the moment when you arrived. - Listen to me, chicken legs. - What ? I'm twice as strong as you, right ? I make twice as much as you, right ? My dick is twice as big. Why the hell did she choose you ? - My modesty. - I'm twice as modest as you. Dork. Bye, Sandro, watch out for the stake. Let's go. Laura ! Why do you do this to me ? If you go with him, I'll kill myself. Right here and now, I'll set myself on fire. Don't laugh ! - That's champagne ! - Champagne ? This is... Diego ! Laura... Come on. You don't deserve the way that lunatic treats you... The car doesn't work, can you take me to the bus stop ? Yes, my love, wherever you want. - The bus stop will be fine. - We'll talk about it on the way. Why don't we go home ? Stop ! What the hell is he doing here ? He's taking me to the bus stop. I'm in. Wait, wait ! I get it now, Laura, I understand you don't want to be in a can, that I have to make each day different, and I admit, sometimes what I don't plan turns out best. Like when we hid from the other me. Which we haven't done yet, we'll do that tomorrow. - I don't understand, Diego. - You've failed you stupid idiot. Diego, Diego ! Stop, stop, stop ! - Laura, Laura, Laura ! - Stop ! - What are you doing ? - You're the one that trapped him. Diego ! Love, are you OK ? "Love", you called me "love". Lauri, you can't go with this retard. - What's that ? - Must have been the wind. In the trunk ? I didn't hear anything. Just a second. Let's go to the beach. We have to make sure you're OK, sweetheart. - Laura ! - Calm down, everything is fine. - Laura ! - What ? I'll take him to the hospital. - OK, let's go to the hospital. - Laura, no. We're going to the beach. Laura, you have a call now. Hello Laura, it's me, I know you don't want to speak to me right now, I acted like an idiot, but I'm asking you for one last chance. I'll wait for you at the motel. And two things. Come alone and bring the same dress you wore yesterday... I have to go. - But why ? - Something I built, it's unstable. - Can't you just go tomorrow ? - I have to destroy the loop. - Get you out of there. - But I'm right here. Yes, but you're also there, like me. I'm sorry. Diego ! Where are you ? Diego, where are you ? - You seem different. - Different ? - You seem calmer. - I want us to try it again. - Our moment has passed. - Our moment has passed. - Nobody is coming. - You never came. - What ? - You didn't come back for me. I sent you to come and speak with me, you left with Sandro. You're the one that pushed me back to Sandro. - I was an idiot. - This is a senseless loop. - Laura, you have to come back. - We have to go. No. It was your last chance. And you let it get away. Don't move. Laura, listen. Stop repeating the same phrases, react to what I... I'm tired of this. - Where are you going ? - Back home. - Laura I just want to help. - Well you're not helping. This never happened before. What is she doing here ? Diego ! Diego, where are you ? You followed me from the beach ? She came back and you never left. - You look different. - Different ? You look calmer. I want us to try it again. Our moment has passed. Will you give me another chance ? No. For now, no. But why not ? Do you think we can be together again ? It seems complicated. Look at you, you're trapped in yourself, you can't move ahead. I love you, but I need to move ahead in life. I love you too, Laura. Yeah, but there's no way this is going to work. I promise you I can get this to work. Why do you complicate things so much ? This is a confluence of the past, present, and future. In the same space. Laura, you have to listen to me. - There's nothing to listen to. - We can fix this. I need to be alone. Laura, wait ! Laura ! Laura, I know how to fix it. You have to listen to me. - Laura. - Laura ! - Laura it's me. - Laura ! Wait. - You have to listen to me. - Laura ! Laura, wait ! Laura, listen ! - Laura ! - No, no, no, no ! "This will self-distruct the phone. Are you sure ?" Yes. "Are you really sure ?" Please ! Come on, come on. Laura, listen ! I'm sorry. Now what do we do ? I don't know, I don't care. And what's the plan ? There's no plan. - Didn't you say it didn't work ? - I didn't want you to leave. May I have two peaches, please ? Thanks. Is that all ? Diego ? PEACHES
