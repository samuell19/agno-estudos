- Here's your man. Thanks, Ernesto. I'll see you next week. - Your girlfriend's a lucky lady, Ernesto. - Thanks, Ernesto! - Hola, Ernesto. - Hola, Yum Yum! Crazy weather, huh? Thank you, Weight Watchers. Oh. Baby, I'm so glad to see you! How's my sweet boy? You're my sweet boy, so clean and fragrant. Hi, Ernesto, you smell like a burnt chimichangas. Oh! On the cheek, please, I just got my lips perfect. - For you. How sweet! Put them in water for me? Put 'em with your other ones. And toss out the older ones, they're beginning to reek. Did you get the raise? My business at the salon is really down. Isn't it cute how possessive he is? - Cute? Yes. - So, the raise? You're kidding? Well, what did they say? - You're fired. - Because you wanted more money? - Not exactly. And how about you? I'll be right back. I'll take care of it. - Thanks. - Dine and dash? - No, it's too crowded. Better idea. - How may I help you? - I hate to complain, but our service was terrible. Absolutely the worst. - Yeah, our server was slow, rude, and just completely not helpful. - Who waited on you? - Him. - Ernesto? - Yeah, he sucked! - Come here. These gentlemen say you that were rude to them! - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be. Can I get you a free flan? - That's not gonna cut it, you should comp our whole meal. - Yeah, that's pretty much the only way I'm not gonna totally trash you guys on Yelp. - Of course, of course. This is coming out of your pay. - Sorry. - So that means your paycheck will be even less? That's terrible! - It get worst. Hey, Juan. - Back off, man! - Is there a problem? - Uh, yeah, I saw Ernesto taking money from the cash drawer. - What? - What? - I saw him, Dad. - How could you? - I didn't do anything. - Then where's the money? - I don't know. - I've treated you like family, and this is how you pay me back? - I swear, I didn't! - You're fired. I want you to leave right now. Now. - Oh, that makes me so mad! - Raul is not such a bad guy. - I'm mad at you! What are we supposed to do for money? How will we pay for food, for rent? For shoes? - You don't have enough shoes? Shoes are my signature accessory! Plus they are the one thing that separate us from animals, and I will not live like an animal, and neither will Yum Yum. What are you going to do? - I'll find work. - But that could take days! How will we survive in the meantime? - Well, you have a job. - And? - Maybe you can kick in a little? - This isn't working. I should have listened to my mother. She said you would never amount to anything, and I told her she was wrong. Damn you for making her right! - I'll find a job. I promise. - It's too late. I can't live with uncertainty. Yum Yum and I will move in with Mommy. - In Miami? - At least her man is a great provider. - I thought she divorced him. - Yes. He provides from a distance. Mommy's got all the luck. Well, all packed! Let's keep this simple, okay? - Okay. - They say that people come into your life for a season, a reason, or a lifetime. Our season is just over. Oh, you've always been so sweet to me, Ernesto. But sweet don't pay the bills. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. It's better this way. For me, anyway. - It's going to be sad here without you. - True, but not for long. They've already re-rented the place. Two frat boys move in tomorrow, so you'll need to be out tonight. See? Clean break for both of us. Toodles! Oh! Two more things. I left that ficus plant you like so much, I always hated that thing. So, you're welcome. And two, we won't get any of the deposit money back unless the place is spotless. I just got my nails done, so could you please be a dear, and take care of that? Thanks! - My little Nenita. A nice shower will perk you up. She's going to miss us. I know she will. Ah! - That'll be $95, plus tax. - That much? - Yeah. How you gonna pay? - I have. - Sorry, no discounts. You got a credit card, something? - No. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - I don't have all night. You're holding up Daisy and her friend. - No rush, Joey. Easy, meter's not running. - Look, sport, unless you come up with the difference, I can't help you. - Wait. Baby, can we help this poor guy out? - We? You help him out. - No, that's nice, but. - I'll make it worth your while. - Okay. - Here, you're good. Room 143. Checkout's at noon. - Thank you! - Hey, I'm just a horny schmuck. - Does that mean a generous guy? - In my experience it does. - Ah, horny schmuck. I like that. You and me both. - I will send you the money, if you just give me your name and. - Oh, no names. Consider it a gift. Good luck. - Okay. - So how may we help you today? - I'd like to take out money. - Perfect, do you have a withdrawal slip? - I don't know, my girlfriend always does the banking. - It's not a problem, what's your name? - Ernesto Hernandez. - Hernandez. Ernesto P or Ernesto W? - Ernesto P. - Perfect. Do you have your ATM card? - Veronica does. I could call her, but she's still in bed, it's only 11:30. - Uh-huh. May I see your I.D.? - Yeah. - Perfect. Is this your current address? - No. - May I have it? - As soon as I get it. - I mean, where are you currently living? - Your guess is as good as mine. - Let's start again. Address? - I'd like one. - You don't have one? Where do you sleep? - In a bed. Where do you sleep? - Do you have another form of identification, like a credit card? - No, I pay cash. That's why I came to get some. - Well, you need a credit card so I know who you are. - Okay, you talked me into it. - Into what? - A credit card, I'll take one. - Do you have credit? - I will as soon as you give me the card. - I can't do that. - I'll take the cash then. - I can't do that either. - Then how do I get my money? - Come back with a credit card! - Excuse me, may I borrow your credit card? - Not hers! Yours. - Thanks anyway. - Hi. - Yeah, thank you. Have a good day! Thanks, Ernesto. Where's your furry little friend? - Miami. - Wish I could travel. Maybe when I get my big break. Why you so sad? - Oh, lost my job, lost my girl, lost my apartment. - Well, I can't help with the apartment or the girl, but I did see a help wanted sign over there. - Mexican restaurant? I have experience in those! - That's perfect, you should go apply! - Maybe you should have the first shot at it? - Me, nah, nah, drumming's my gig. You check it out. And I'll even play you some special Ernesto walk-away music for good luck. - Good day's work, Ernesto. - Thanks, Javier. So, did you make enough to get a room tonight? - Almost. - I hear you. You could stay with us, but our place is small, and my wife has the flu. - Oh, I hope she gets better soon. - Me, too. When she can't sleep, nobody does. - Oh. - There might be something I could do, although Jerry wouldn't like it. - Jerry? - The owner. Good guy, but he's pretty by-the-book. - And he gets mad if you don't buy the book? No. No, there is no book, it's an expression. I like you, Ernesto. You seem like good people. So I'm gonna do something I probably shouldn't. - I don't want to get you in trouble. - I'll take my chances. Our office is pretty crowded, but there's a couch there that you can crash on for a few nights. But let's keep this our little secret. And don't touch anything, okay? Got it, no touching. That was my girlfriend's rules, too. - Been there. - What the hell are you doing here? - Sleeping? I'm not an idiot! Did Javier tell you you could do this? - Javier? I don't know any Javier. I didn't have any place to sleep, so I snuck in after everybody left. - You snuck in? Through the side door? - Yes. - We don't have a side door, only a back and a front! - The door on the back side. - I just came in through that door, it was locked and the alarm was on. How do you explain that? - I'm a good sneaker? - You are? - The best. I sneak in everywhere without help. I'm a wolf with no friends. - You mean a lone wolf? - Yes, that. You are not scared of me? I could be dangerous. - I'll take my chances. - That's what Javier said. - You said you didn't know Javier. I did say that. We met today where he hired me to wait tables. - Really? He's barely more than a stranger, yet you show him such loyalty. - He helped me so I help him. - Hmm. Sir, you humble me. What's your name? - Ernesto. - Ernesto was my dad's best friend. Called him Uncle Ernie, he was a good man. You mind if I call you Ernie, too? - Ernie Two, Ernie Three, whatever you like. - I'm Jerry, Jerry Cochran. You know, I like you, Ernie, and I don't like many people. That said, you're not sleeping here. Pack up your things. - I understand. I don't understand. - You can crash here. It's my guest house, which makes you my guest. - Really? Thank you. You are truly a schmuck. - I beg your pardon? - Maybe the most schmuck I ever met. What's so funny? - You, Ernie! What do you think the word schmuck means? - A generous guy. That's not right? - No. People usually use it to mean idiot or fool. But literally, it's a penis. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call you a penis. I'll leave. Ernie, I've been called a schmuck before by people who actually know what it means. And I think that's the funniest thing I've heard in a long time. "The most schmuck I ever met." I think I want that carved on my tombstone. - There you go, Nenita, drink up, then we'll give you some indirect sunlight. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Does it ever answer? - Not with words. But she feels better when I talk to her. - Maybe I should have you talk to my orchids. They never seem to last. - I could try. - Really? Okay, what the hell. - You have a very beautiful yard. - Because I have a very expensive gardener. - He must love his work. - His employees do most of the work, but he does love billing me for their time. - Your home is a palace. - Don't be too impressed, it's a family heirloom. - Like a tomato? No. What I mean is this property has been in the family for years. The Cochrans are old money. - Does age of money matter? - In Pasadena it does, big time. Old money is respected and revered. There they are, like I said, on their last legs, or stem thingys. - They look sad. - Leave it to me to have depressed vegetation. And maybe a little lonely. - They've got each other. - You can be lonely in a crowd. You are all beautiful, you know that? And you are not alone. You are among friends. - Sounds like group therapy. - They need love and attention. Treat them like you treat your wife. - Give them half my stuff and file a restraining order? I'm divorced. It wasn't pretty. - The new guy may be our best worker yet. - Yes, I'm very impressed with him. - Me too, boss. - That must be why you let him sleep on the couch. - He told you that? - No, I figured it out. What were you thinking? - Sorry. I guess I'm just a softie. You need to toughen up. - Got it. I promise it won't happen again. - Damn straight. My guest house is much nicer than that ratty couch. - He's staying with you? But you just said. - I guess I'm a softie, too. - Who's interrupting our lounging? Must be a man. They ruin everything. - Even sex? - Especially sex. - It's Ernesto. A poor man, even worse. No, don't you dare answer that! - Shouldn't I check to make sure he's okay? - And if he isn't, you gonna do anything? - Well, no. - So why bother? You're not a fatty anymore, quit thinking like one. It's time to focus on finding a more suitable man. - And by more suitable, you mean rich. Rich is a relative term. Which is why you make a rich man your relative. - Oh, sweetie, you remembered. - You embroidered it on my underwear. - It was a very important lesson. I wanted you to see it every day, and tattooing a four-year-old was frowned upon. Hi, I'm doing something fabulous right now and can't be disturbed. Leave a message, and if I like what I hear, I'll call you back. Ciao! - You are looking beautiful today. So healthy, so strong! Knock, knock. Hi, Jerry! - Ernie, this is Douglas. - Nice to meet you. Same here. - Doug is my lawyer. - Could you say I was your friend? - Well, you are, but you're also my lawyer. - But everybody hates lawyers! All the jokes about lawyers, they end up with us being road-kill, or worse! Everybody thinks it's funny. - 'Cause it is. - I know, that's what makes it so bad! Anyway. - Attorneys, as a group, suck. - If you hate your job so much, why do you do it? The money. - If people are gonna despise you, there might as well be some benefit, right? - Anyway, Doug brought over a bottle of Johnny Walker Platinum, which he can afford, since he's rolling in dough 'cause he's a scumbag lawyer. Sorry, I couldn't resist. I never had this before. - Single malt scotch? - No, hard liquor. - Really? - A beer, wine, sometimes, but that's all. - Sounds like you've led a pretty clean life. - I take a shower every day. - Jerry, you're right, this guy's a hoot! - And a wizard with plants. - I just treat them nice, like I treat everybody. - That's a very good way to be. - Luckily, more people aren't like that, or I'd be out of business. - To Ernesto, a good man and, though we haven't known each other long, a very good friend. - Yes, friends. I'll drink to that. You really have never had hard liquor before? - No. - He's never been married before. - Got it. - Hello, Jerry, it's me Ernie. Just came in to take care of the orchids. Jerry, I just. - Last night as I was putting together the deposits. I had a question so I picked up the phone and I started to call him. - Yeah, I can't believe he's gone. - Have you guys seen Ernie? - He's in the kitchen. - Thanks. Hey, Ernie, how you holding up? - The plants need me. That helps. - Hard to imagine a world without Jerry. Unfortunately, life goes on. I know Jerry was really fond of you, so I'm sure he'd want you to stay on in the guest house until we need to make other arrangements. - Arrangements? - Jerry left the property and the business, pretty much everything to his nephew, Zach. - Oh. - Problem is, Zach's a bit of a nomad. Having trouble finding him. So till I track him down, in keeping with Jerry's wishes, I'm gonna rent out the house. - And when you find Zach? - Who knows? What happens then is completely his decision. - Hi! Are you Ernie? - Yes. - Douglas told me to come introduce myself. I'm Austin. I'm you're new neighbor. I'm renting the house. - Oh, nice to meet you. - Yeah, same here. Listen, since I'm renting pretty much as is, I was wondering if you could continue to take care of the beautiful orchids in the kitchen. Douglas says you have a real way with them. Me, I kill anything green. - I'd be happy to. - Great, I'll pay you, of course. - Oh no, I do it for love. The plants, not you. We just met. You're a funny guy, Ernie. - People say that, I don't know why. - Okay, well, since I can't pay you, why don't you come to a party I'm throwing tomorrow night. It's kind of a housewarming thing. - Housewarming? Maybe if you just turned off the air conditioning. Like I said, funny guy. So you'll join us? - Yes. - Great, we'll see you tomorrow night. Welcome. Have a great time. Ernie, hey, glad you could make it! This is Daniel. - Hey, nice to meet you. - Hi! You have a lot of friends. - They're crew members, it's their job to be friends. - Great party, Austin! - Thank you. - Thanks for having us, boss. My pleasure. - They seem to like their job. What is it you do? - I direct a film here and there. - He's being uncharacteristically modest. - I'm quite good at that. - See? - Si. - He's got a Golden Globe, two DGA awards, and four paternity suits. - And what is it you do? - I produce him, God help me. Those are lovely orchids. - Thanks. - Oh, they're yours? Oh, I thought they were Austin's. - Yes, but I take care of them. - You're doing a really good job. - I'm Cassie. And you are? - Ernie! I see you've met Cassie, our makeup artist extraordinaire. - Yes, she likes your flowers. - Oh no, this guy's got a green thumb. I bet he can make anything grow. - Anything? Wow. Shame you didn't meet my ex before she got her implants. Coulda saved me a bundle on her bundles. - Kyle, that's not nice. - I'm just joking, babe. She hates when I bring up my ex. - So you are her husband? - Husband? No way, Jose! - Ernesto. - I mean, Cassie and I we're tight and all, but we're just keeping things chill, seeing where they go, right, babe? - We live together. - Yeah. Know what, I'm a little dry. I'm gonna grab me another beer. - Cassie, your boyfriend's a great grip, but he's a real piece of work. - Oh, he's a good guy deep down. - Well, if he makes you happy, who are we to judge? - He does. - I think it's about time for that screening, huh? - Copy that! - Screening? - Yeah, we're showing a rough cut of the scene we shot yesterday. Join us? - Yes. Great. - So is it Ernie or Ernesto? - Either. - I like Ernesto. - Ernesto likes you, too. Oh. I meant I like the name, Ernesto. It's more dignified. It's more you. - More me? Good, because I'm the most me of anyone. Okay. Let's go. - Thank you all for helping me break in my temporary new home. I hope you're all enjoying yourselves. And to that end, I've got a very special treat. A private, first look at a scene we shot yesterday! - Which we are going to screen right now since it's getting late, and we don't wanna give anyone an excuse for missing your very early call tomorrow. - Okay, now if I must say so myself, and I must, I am very happy with how it turned out. So I hope you like it. So now here it is, for the first time anywhere, a rough-cut of the sidewalk scene of our soon to be hit movie, - Fingers crossed. - Hot To Cold. And rolling. Anya? - Chase! I can't believe we almost just walked right past each other. I know! How are you? - Always cold, except when I'm hot. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault, it's my thyroid. I know. - It's not all that bad, though. The pounds have been falling off. I look great in skinny jeans. - Always seeing the bright side. - Hold me? - 'Cause you're cold? - Yeah, that's the reason. Let me go, let me go! - What's wrong? - I'm burning up! - Damn your thyroid! Damn your whole endocrine system! - Don't say that, Chase. - I'm sorry. - I should go. - Will I ever see you again, Anya? - That's in God's hands, and Doctor Shapiro's. So you liked it? - Come on, man, of course they liked it, they worked on it. They're not exactly objective. - Okay. Ernie here has absolutely nothing to do with the production. So he can give us a completely honest and unbiased opinion. So, Ernie, what'd you think of the scene? - I like it. - He like it. - And? No, it's okay, we want to hear your honest opinion. Just say what you feel. - Yeah. - Why is everything so hard to see behind the guy and the girl? - I was trying to stylistically represent that in the pivotal moment of their chance encounter, the rest of the world faded away, and only our star-crossed lovers mattered. - It just looks fuzzy. - Okay. So how would you fix it? - Focus? - Focus. So what you're saying is, rather than obscure the rest of the world, make the audience hyper-aware of this couple and their impossible struggle by focusing not on their isolation from the world in general, but their bittersweet interpersonal connection and the resulting inner turmoil. Brilliant! - Okay, I'll schedule a re-shoot. I think we can squeeze it in on Wednesday. - Do it, good! Ernie, thank you! You got a keen eye. Why don't you join us on Wednesday? You can let us know if we've fixed the problem. - I could, it's my day off. - Great, and to make it worth your while, we'll make you a consultant. - A consultant? - We've got some wiggle room in the budget so we can pay you. - You pay me to tell you what I think? - That's the gig, my friend. - Welcome to Hollywood, Ernie. - Looks just like Pasadena. - Did I tell you this guy was funny, or what? - Funny! - You're gonna make a great addition to the set! Hi, I'm doing something fabulous right now and can't be disturbed. Leave a message and if I like what I hear I'll call you back. - Ernie, my man! Thanks for coming. Bettina, I need the paperwork for our new consultant. On it. - We got a few forms for you to fill out. Bettina will those to you, but in the meantime I want you to make yourself at home. Here's your chair. - My chair? - It's got your name on it and everything. - It's beautiful! - It's yours, excuse me. Hey, Ernesto! - I have a chair. - Yeah, it's very nice. - They gave it to me. Yes. - It's mine! - No, I'm great, thanks. Thanks for asking, how are you? - Oh, I'm sorry, it's my first chair. - So I gather. - Nice to see you. How you been? - Just working a lot. But it's all good. - All good is my favorite. - So you have a chair? I guess that means I'll be seeing you around. - I hope. - Me, too. Well, I gotta go. Faces to do, people to see. Ta ta for now. - Tatas for now? - Ernie! Great to see you again, man. You ready to do your consultant thang? - Yes. - Okay! - Okay, Ernie, fill this out and get it back to me. - I'm ready to go. - All right. All right, everybody, let's do this! Okay, let's go, people, let's get this thing going! - Do this. These are yours, here. And action! And noise! Anya? - Chase! I can't believe we almost just walked right past each other! - I know! How are you? - Always cold, except when I'm hot. Yeah. Will I ever see you again, Anya? That's in God's hands, and Doctor Shapiro's. - And cut! Great take! So, what did you think, Ernie? - I like it. - Me, too. And this time the background will be in focus. - Good. - Good. - Any other thoughts? - Well, maybe. Nah, never mind. - No, tell us, that's why you're here, Ernie. Yeah, what is it? - At the end, they are still on cell phones again. - Right, I added that. - Why? - I wanted to depict them immersed in technology, acting as an emotional anesthetic. It's a coping mechanism. It allows them to have a purely superficial connection to the world outside of their hearts, and protecting them from their true feelings. - They look like they just don't care. - So what should they do? - Maybe walk away sad without looking at phones? - Hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's like they start to look at their phones, and then realize they need to feel their pain, and put them away, thereby dealing with their pain instead of sublimating it. I love, I love! Let's do what Ernie said. Daniel, I think our friend needs a better title. - What did you have in mind? Associate producer? - Sounds good. - Make it so. Congratulations, Ernie. - What does an associate producer do? - It's an important job, Ernie. Big responsibility. - Hey, Ernie. All right, these are all the extras for the beach party scene, but we got some revision pages, and some new speaking parts. So we need to upgrade three of these women. - Who? - It's up to you. - Me? - Mmhm. - No. - Well, I don't know what to tell you because Austin said it was your job, so. All right, I'll help you. Take a seat. All right, ladies, attention, attention. We need to upgrade three of you to speaking parts. Our associate producer Ernie here will be deciding who gets the upgrade. Form a line right here. We'll meet with you one by one. When you step up, say your name, and read the line I tell you. Yes? - Can we get the line in advance so we can practice? And maybe a little background about the character and the scene so we can be properly motivated? No, and no. It's one line, you can do it cold. All right, let's get this show on the road. Form a line, ladies. First up. - Hello, Ernie. I've been told I've got very kissable lips. How was that? - Good. We'll let you know. - Hi. My name is Savannah. Just Savannah, like the city. And like the city, I'm sweet and southern. I've been told that I have got very kissable lips. What was that? - Trying to impress him, I guess. Okay, that's not right. - Why do you care? - No, I don't care, I don't care. Just it's not right. Next! - Hi, I'm Jill Martin. Okay. I've been told I've got very kissable lips. Wait, can I do it again? I swear I can do it better, okay. - Wow. - I've been told I've got very kissable lips. Very. Very! - Cut! All right, girl. I feel really good about that one! - These girls are really going for it. - Yeah, but he doesn't have to like it so much. Are you kidding me? He looks scared to death. A hot woman just leaned in for a kiss, and he yells cut. What kinda guy does that? - There you go, my beautiful friend. Drink up, life is good. Must need a charge. - Could you hand me my phone, Mom? - If it's Ernesto I am not handing it to you. - I've been ghosting him. He's left a bunch of messages and I haven't called him back. - Good girl. - Who is it? - Doesn't say, it's just a number. - Give it. Hello? - Hi, Veronica, it's me Ernesto. - Hi, Ernesto. - Hang up! You sound good. - You sound - Like the worthless loser that you are. - Like you. Thank you. - I don't recognize this number, is it new? - Yes, they gave it to me at work. - Well, that's nice. - I was hoping we could catch up a little. - Now's not a good time. I'm on my way to a charity ball. It's a really prestigious event. - The kind you could never afford to take her to. - Tell your mom I say hi. - Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later. I'm sure he heard you, Mom. - That was the point. - What are you doing? - I am writing loser on the new number so you know who is calling. - What's wrong? - Why does everyone always expect the worst when they see a lawyer? - So you have good news? - Well, no, but it would still be nice if people didn't dread seeing you. - I don't dread you, Douglas. - Thank you, Ernie, you're a nice man. I got an update. I finally found Jerry's nephew. - Zach? - Yeah, we haven't spoken, you know, the time difference between here and India, but there's a real possibility that he's gonna want you to move out. I just felt that I should give you a heads-up. - Thank you. My head is up. - Thanks, Ernesto. - Excuse me, may I take it now? Thank you. - Perfect. - So how are things going on the movie? - Oh, great! They made me associate producer. - And you're still working here? - Well, Jerry took care of me. Now he is not here, I help out. - Your loyalty is inspiring. - No big deal, it's just who I am. - I'm so hungry. - I know. Tacos. - Hi, Cassie, Kyle. - Ernie! What are you doing here? - I help out on weekends. - That's very industrious. - Yes. - Damn, do you also pick lettuce at night? - Kyle! - What? Isn't that what industrious Mexicans do? - I'm Cuban. - Same thing, pal. - No, it's not. - What are you talking about? They speak Spanish, eat beans, and steal our jobs. - You'd like to work here? I'd be happy to put in a good word with Javier. - How about you just get us some chips and salsa, amigo. Por favor. See, I can be polite in Spanish. - And yet amazingly rude in English. I mean, wow. - All right, let's go. - Kyle, you forgot the tip. - Okay, okay. - That's not even 10 %. - Well, his service wasn't that good. Besides, moneybags here has three jobs. - Two. Two, he does not pick crops. Oh, that's right, he just looks like he does. Let's go. Great seeing you, Ernesto. I'm so sorry Kyle was a jerk and treated you so badly. You deserve much better. See you at work. Do all movies have this many parties? - Only Austin's. He says a happy crew is a productive crew. The truth is, the budget's tight and the company's cheap, so this perk is designed to keep the natives from getting restless, you know? - No. - He thinks that if he keeps us drunk we'll be too distracted to realize we're getting screwed. So, cheers! Time for another. Be right back. - Hey, Ernie! How's my favorite production honcho? - I don't know, but I could find out. - No, silly, I mean you. - I'm a honcho? - My favorite. - Good, I'll try not to let you down. - You won't. - You seem taller. - These are my party heels! - Good, 'cause I was scared I was shrinking. - Hey, you don't have a drink? - I'm not much of a drinker. - I'll let you in on a little secret. I can trust you, can't I? - Of course, I'm a honcho. You are. So, you see this drink I'm holding? - Yes. - It's not actually a drink. It looks like I'm drinking a cocktail, but it's really a mocktail. - So mock not cock? - I like you, Ernie, but sexual harassment is never okay. - What I'm trying to say is, even though I'm 18, everybody still thinks I'm a kid, and I hate that. But my parents are alcoholics, and I don't wanna go down that road, too. - Good idea. Bad road. - So I hold this drink that looks like alcohol, and everybody thinks I'm not a child. And I get to party without people making past my bedtime jokes. - That's very adult, more than most people I know. - Aww, thanks, Ernie. And you won't tell anyone? - Honcho's honor. - You know, Ernesto, every time I see you, a pretty girl's giving you a kiss. - It just happens, I don't know why. - I'm just busting your balls. - I hope not. - You know, Ernesto, there's just something about you that. - That what? - Hey, babe, we're getting ready to do some shots, you want one? - Why not? - You can get one over there. Hey, you're not drinking? Oh wait, are you here as a guest, or are you with catering? - Kyle! I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Come on, Kendall, just do it. - Yeah, Ken, loosen up. - If she doesn't wanna do it then just. - Sure she does. Why wouldn't she? Why wouldn't you? Come on. - I. Drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink! - Okay! Come on, guys, she's just a kid. - Okay. - Whoa, you just stole her drink, man! - Well, you know, steal jobs, steal drinks, same thing. - Okay, this one is for you. - Muchas gracias. Hey! - I'm a drinking machine! Ernie, Ernie, Ernie! - I mean this is a good one. This is probably the best one. Hey, Douglas, glad you could join our little soiree. You and your friend, grab some refreshments. - Thanks. Austin, this is Jerry's nephew, Zach, your landlord. - Not for long. - I beg your pardon? - Well, as I told you, the rental is ongoing and contingent on Zach's approval. - Well, we love this place and we hope to be here the rest of production and through post production, as well. Maybe even longer, with your blessing, of course. - That's what I indicated to Zach. But he wanted to come and size up the situation for himself. So he and I will discuss it, and then I'll get back to you with a projected time frame. - Not necessary. You're Hollywood people, right? - I direct and Daniel here, he produces. - Hey. - I see. Well, the vibe here disturbs me. - Ah, we can turn down the music. - Could you turn down the depravity and moral decay? - I could burn some sage. - Perfume cannot hide the most heinous of stenches. It worked during the Middle Ages. No one bathed. They got pretty ripe. - Look, your show biz lifestyle conflicts with everything that I've been studying, everything that I now believe. I'm afraid I'm gonna need you out of here as soon as possible. - Ah, sorry, Austin. I guess this serves as your 30 day notice. We'll make it official in writing tomorrow. - And what about the guest house? - Ah, that'd be Ernie. - I'll need to meet him. - He's through there. - A really good guy. He's the salt of the Earth. The best. Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, Ernie! - There he is. - Ernie? Ernie! Ernie! - Hi. - We didn't get a chance to meet last night, but I'm Jerry's nephew, Zach. - Nice to meet you. Sorry, I didn't mean to yell. - You didn't. - Then can you stop? Excuse me. - Douglas will be giving you written notice, but I wanted to let you know that I'll need you out in 30 days. - Why, are you moving in? - No. - You've rented to someone else? No. - You're selling the place? - No. - Then why do you want me out? - I just returned from extended time with the Dalai Lama, and it changed me, for the better. Now I know who I really am. - And who you really are wants me out? - Actually, yes. Now that I have discovered true peace, it's important that I surround myself with calm and tranquility. You and your crowd are the antithesis of that. Your hard-partying ways are just a bad fit. - I'm not a hard partier. - Your actions last night say otherwise. - I was just trying to help somebody. - Yes, drinking yourself into oblivion is very philanthropic. - But I really like it here, it's my home. - Yes, for the next 30 days. - All right, guys, so that concludes our safety meeting. Hopefully the weather will cooperate, but in the meantime let's get set up for the first shot, all right? All right. - Everybody, can I have your attention please? Please, whatever you're doing just stop. - This doesn't sound good. - Ernie, what's going on? - I don't know. - I come from a grand theater tradition, I can project. All right, there's really no great way to say this, so just gonna get straight to the point. The studio is having some financial problems, so they may try to shut us down. I'm not saying it's definitely gonna happen, but it's a possibility. - A very real possibility. - That being said, I know you've all put a lot of time and energy and more than a lot of love into this movie, so I'm not just willing to let it go away. It's gonna take a lot of work, okay, but if we all pull together and work harder, and smarter, and faster, I think we can keep this puppy alive. - Nothing sadder than a dead puppy. - I don't feel so well. - I don't think he means a real doggy. - That's not what I mean. This film was supposed to be my big break. If they pull the plug, I may as well kiss my acting career goodbye. - There will be other films. - You don't know that. - So we've come up with a new schedule. You're all gonna get a copy. But the only way it's gonna work is if you're all committed to this. So who's with me? Yeah! - Okay, great! Let's go ahead and get set up for the next shot. And thank you, everybody. Let's do this! That went better than I thought. - Let's hit the. - I have an idea. - Okay. - Go on. - I know night scenes are hard to shoot and cost a lot. What if we just make all the night scenes day scenes? - You know, this could work. - Yeah, it absolutely can. In fact, some of these scenes might play even better that way. - It would definitely speed up production. And save us a ton of money. Ernie, you're brilliant! Daniel, I think our friend just earned himself a better title. That's real producer thinking. So why don't we make him one? - Well, we do have five of them, four of whom do nothing. One more can't hurt. - A producer? - Yes, but we can only give you a little more money. - I'd do it for less money. - Oh, you don't wanna say that out loud, Ernie. They'll throw you out of the Producers Guild before you even get in. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm just messing with you, man, congratulations. We should really fill in the department heads. - Yeah, right. See you around, Mister Producer. - Check it out. Hey, Austin, do you have a minute? - Sure. - I'm kinda freaking out about what you just said. - Ah, don't, okay, I think it'll be okay. I just needed to rally the troops. And besides Ernie already has a great fix. So you just go concentrate on your performance and let us worry about the money. - And by us he means me. Oh, one more thing. Who was that guy at your party, the one who seemed so out-of-place? - I'm not sure who you're talking about. - He was with another guy and they took off when they saw us start the drinking game. - Oh, she's talking about Douglas and your soon to be ex-landlord. - Ah, yeah, Zach. Apparently he doesn't approve of show folk, so he's kicking me out. And Ernie, he was especially pissed at him. - Why? Ernie's a sweetheart. - He was put off by the way Ernie was pounding 'em back. - But that wasn't his fault. - Doesn't matter. In a few weeks, Ernie and I are toast. - Hey, Javier. - Douglas! - Zach just wanted to check out the weekend lunch business. - Thought I'd get a feel for how the place runs. - Well, you're welcome any time, which of course you knew that since you own the place. I really am not an imbecile, really. - Relax. I'm not planning on making any changes right away, so your job is safe. - Thanks, boss. It smells good. Maybe we should grab a bite. - Oh, I can always eat. - Excellent. Come right this way. Here we are. Thank you. - Enjoy your meal. And if you need anything, just ask. Anything. Hey, Ernie! - Douglas, Zach, welcome. - You work here? - Weekends. - But I thought you were a producer? - Oh, he is, but he still works shifts here out of loyalty to your uncle. - It's the least I can do. Everything is good, but our chicken mole is the best anywhere! - Ooh, let's see. - Austin, it's Zach, your landlord. You there? Austin? - You should all be very proud. You're beautiful, strong and healthy. I'll miss you all when I'm gone, but don't be sad. We'll be okay. Ernie, can't touch that! - I can't? - It's a grievance. Only electricians can touch this, union rules. Hey! - You may have to grievance me, I touched the light. - You also saved me from a serious face-plant. You're cool. - I'm cool. - Ernie, we need to keep things moving so go tell makeup to get their ass in gear. We need Kendall on set. And asap! - Oh, hey, Ernie! I'm so sorry that I got you in trouble with your landlord. You were just trying to help me out. - It's okay. Where's Cassie? - She called in sick. So I'm a person down, and I'm way behind. - She's sick? - She damn well better be, I haven't had a cigarette break in hours, and I am jonesing big time. Was there something else you wanted? - Yes, Kendall, on the set with somebody named asap. - I'm going as fast as I can. - Good. That must mean your ass is already on gear. - What? - Kyle! - Kinda busy, man. - How is Cassie? Is she feeling better? Does she needs anything? - Not from you. I got her covered, so back off. Capiche? - Just a minute, I'm grabbing my wallet. All right. Ernesto? I thought you were the pizza guy. - Pizza? Good, that must mean you feel better. - Oh, because I called in sick, yeah. - I was worried about you. - That's so sweet. I'm doing better, thanks. - Eye trouble? - What? - You're wearing sunglasses inside. - It's ironic. I'm a makeup artist and no matter what I tried I couldn't cover it up. - Are you okay? - We shouldn't do this out here, come in. - What happened? Please don't judge me. - I would never judge. - Kyle just got so mad. - He hit you? - Yes. - Has he done it before? You need to leave. - He was really sorry. He said he wouldn't do it again. - And you believe him? - I have to. - It's not right. - Ernesto, promise me that you will not say anything to Kyle, that you won't say anything to anybody. - But it's right! - Promise me. - Okay. - You shouldn't be here. Kyle will be home any minute. It wouldn't be good if you were here. Thank you, Ernesto. - That'll be 15.85. - Here, keep the change. - Thanks! - Thank you. You didn't have to do that. - I can afford it. I am a big-shot producer now. - You really are a Godsend. - If God sent me, why do you send me away? - Hello? It's me, Ernesto! - Oh, hi, Veronica. - I just got a sec, but I wanted you to know I'm coming back to Cali and I'd love to see you. - Why? - Because, silly, it's been a long time. And I have a surprise. - What kind of surprise? - You'll find out when I see you. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later. - I used to love that woman, Nenita. I think I'm the biggest schmuck. - Okay, background. We'll get you guys set in a minute so don't wander too far, all right? Oh, Ernie! Have you seen Austin? I need to talk to him about setting the extras for the final shot. - I'll find him. - All right, thank you. - Excuse me, do you know where I can find Ernie Hernandez? - He's out looking for our director. He went that way. - Steve, you seen Austin? - A minute ago. He went over there with Daniel. - Thanks. - I'm so sick of that? - Why were you, why? Yes, you were! Listen to me, I saw you, okay! Why 'cause you know I'm right? - Is everything okay? - Stay out of this, man. This doesn't concern you, all right? - I don't think so. - You're hurting me! Let go! - Let her go, now! - Listen, son. I don't take orders from waiters, I give 'em to 'em. Now, what do you wanna do about it? Everything all right here? - Let go of the young lady. Yeah, I don't take orders from extras either, all right, man. Hey, get off! You got no right to do this, man! - You assaulted this woman and a police officer, you are under arrest! - Hey, you're taking this method acting thing way too far, man! I will sue you! - I don't think so, they are real policemen. I had our casting people hire them. - For authenticity. - And in case you tried to hurt someone, again. Not bad for a waiter, huh? - Come on, let's go. - I'm sorry, I had to do something. - Thank you. Nicely done, Ernie! Yes, very impressive. It was nothing. - Maybe to you, but to me it means a lot. - And that means a lot to me. - Well, sorry to interrupt this love fest, but we actually have some news for you, Ernie. Good news, delivered by an attorney! Guys at the firm are never gonna believe this. - Good news? - Maybe I should tell him? - Okay, but I'm still taking credit. - I need to apologize to you, Ernie. - I accept. - But you don't know what I did. - It's okay, you already say you are sorry, that's good enough for me. - I was so wrong about you. But now I've discovered the guy you really are. - I tried to tell him, no, wouldn't listen to me. Then he gets this long text from some Kendall girl, and suddenly he's a believer. - Kendall? - She explained your drinking, and praised your character. - I think it was her use emojis that really sealed the deal. - They were very compelling. Look, I made a snap judgment about you, and I was wrong. - It's okay, it happens. - No, I shouldn't have judged you to begin with. It goes against all of the Dalai Lama's teachings. Apparently I have much more to learn. - Life is full of lessons. - Exactly! So I'm returning to India to resume my studies, if His Holiness will have me. And since I don't know when, or if I'm ever coming back, I'm divesting myself from all entanglements here. I'm turning everything over to you. - Jerry named you as an alternate beneficiary. - I don't understand? - The house and guest house, all the furnishings, and Los Toros, all yours, free and clear. - Even the orchids? - You are a very special person, Ernie. Uncle Jerry knew it, and now I know it, too. I know he's smiling down on us right now. Good luck to you, Ernie. - I don't know what to say. Next to discovering Target, this is the best thing that ever happen to me. No, Cassie is the best thing, but Target is a strong number two. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! - I'm gonna miss you so much, Ernie. You're like my best friend on this movie. - Don't miss me, visit me anytime. You know where I live. - I'm gonna be here so much, you're gonna get sick of me. Stay in touch, I mean it. - More women kissing you? - I'm like a magnet for lips. - No, I would say you are. - Wrap parties can be bittersweet. We meet, we work together, and then we go our separate ways. But I want each and every one of you to know how much I cherish you all, and this baby that we birthed together. - Yes, and thanks to the powers-that-be putting the squeeze on us, the delivery was a bit premature. But healthy nonetheless. So thank you, everybody, for all the hard work through some very difficult conditions. You really came through in a big way. - And I want to give a special shoutout to Ernie, who started out as my neighbor, then became a producer, and is now my landlord. Thank you, Ernie, for your wisdom, your common sense, and your all around general goodness. We couldn't have done this without you. All right, so everybody enjoy yourselves, all right. Eat, drink, dance, whatever, have a fantastic time. You've earned it! - Yes! - Thank you for what you said. - I meant it. Working with you has been one of my favorite things to come out of this production. - This movie changed my life in a big way. - Yeah, mine, too. It's how I met my wonderful Ernesto. - That's me, can you believe it? - So, Ernie, you still waiting tables over at Los Toros now that you own the place? - Not anymore. - No, he agreed to sell it to a big restaurant group that's wanted it for a long time. - Wow. Sounds like you'll be rolling in the dough, my friend. - Yeah. Might have to hit you up to finance our next feature. - Actually, my generous boyfriend is donating most of the money to a battered women's shelter right by the studio. - They need the money more than I do. - That's one of the most amazing, selfless gestures I've ever heard of. Keep it to yourself. You might give Hollywood producers a good name. - Yeah, we can't have that. We have a heinous reputation to uphold. - I like that take. Looks real. - You got a good eye, Ernie, I marked that one, too. Let's make that the master. - Hi, Veronica. You're in L.A.? Now? Okay, meet me here at the corner of Fifth and Central. I'll see you then. That was my ex-girlfriend. - She wants to see you? - Yes, in a half hour. - Good luck. - I don't need luck, I got Cassie. Ernesto! - Hi, Veronica. - Yum Yum's sorry he couldn't make it, but he's at the spa getting a massage. He's been under a lot of stress. - I'm sorry to hear that. - This is Arlo. - Hi, Arlo. - Hello. - He's a very successful businessman. Owns his own barber shop. With four chairs. - Ernesto, you're sweet, but Arlo here is a real catch. - I'm happy for you. - See, what did I tell you? - Yeah, he's just how you described him. - I know, right? - Oh, who's this? - Oh. I'm sorry. - No, no, it's okay. - This is my Cassie. - How sweet. - It's really nice to meet you. - I'm sure. I have that surprise I promised you, Ernesto! And here it is. I said, here it is! - Oh, yeah! - Ah, surprise! Oh, the look on your face is absolutely priceless! Makes this trip worthwhile! Relax, silly boy, it's not yours. - No, I'm the baby daddy, yeah. - So are you shocked? - Not as much as I was. - A little. But I'm happy for both of you. - Congratulations. - A diamond solitaire? - Oh, you like? Me, too. Ernesto has such great taste. - You're engaged? - Surprise! - Nice design, huh? I wonder if they make that in cubic zirconia? - So, Ernesto, why are we meeting here? - I work here. - Oh. At that charming Mexican restaurant across the street? - No. Here. - Oh, in the commissary? - Oh, I've never been in a commissary. Do they serve the frog's legs? I've always wanted to try those. - Look right up there. - Hot To Cold. So what? - Pay close attention to the producer's name. - Ernesto Hernandez. Wait. My Ernesto's a producer? - No. My Ernesto is a producer. - Hey, babe, how cool is that? - So cool. - And look at that building right over there. - The Ernesto Hernandez Center for Endangered Women and Families. What the fuck?! - I found a catch, too. - I was wrong, babe. He's not how you described him at all. - Don't touch me! Call us another Uber. We're leaving! - Bye, Veronica, bye, Arlo. - It was nice meeting you! I'm so over the lottery. I feel like I buy and I buy and I buy and I never win. - Me, too, but it's really big tonight, so I'd like to get one. - Okay, knock yourself out. - Wait, is that an expression? - You are learning, you're catching on. That's great! - I hope so, because I really hate hurting myself. Oh, you know what I feel like? - I'm touching you, and you feel good. - Yes. So do you. But I was thinking it might be nice to get some ice cream. There is a 31 Flavors down this street. - Perfect! I think I'm gonna get a scoop in every flavor. - Knock yourself up. - That's not right? - It's close, it's very, very close. - And now I introduce to you for the first time ever, Mr. And Mrs. Ernesto Hernandez! - Thanks for the congas, Ernesto! - Surprised? - Completely. But you didn't need to do this. I'm not even sure how you did this. - Love, and a big truck. I just wanted to give you something special for our wedding. - And all I got you was a watch. - And I love it! It's now my second favorite thing, behind you. I guess Target's now number three. - I can't believe I married such a wonderful man. I'm so lucky. - We both are so lucky. Welcome home, Mrs. Hernandez. - There is no place I would rather be, Mr. Hernandez! ¶ You are the one I never knew I needed, ah ¶ ¶ I felt all right, but now I feel completed, ah ¶ ¶ I was stuck in place ¶ ¶ Without momentum or direction ¶ ¶ Then I saw your face ¶ ¶ And all my senses made connection ¶ ¶ You are the one I never knew I needed, ah ¶ ¶ I felt all right but now I feel completed, ah ¶ ¶ I was satisfied ¶ ¶ That what I had was all I wanted ¶ ¶ You made me realize ¶ ¶ My hopes and dreams had all been blunted ¶ ¶ You are the one I never knew I needed ¶ ¶ Fill my world so sweetly ¶ ¶ I felt all right but now I feel completed ¶ ¶ Share your love completely ¶ ¶ You are the one ¶ ¶ Fill my world so sweetly ¶ ¶ You are the one ¶ ¶ Share your love completely ¶ ¶ You are the one ¶ ¶ You are the one ¶ ¶ You are the one ¶
