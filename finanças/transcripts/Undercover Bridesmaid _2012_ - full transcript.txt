A moccacino, please. - Small, big or medium? Small. No, big. Are you waiting! No, you'd rather make a small one. How big is "medium"? If you do not mind, I would be happy to return for lunch. Sorry. Small. - What's your name? - Ogul. I am glad. - Ogul? How are you? I saw you since the party in French Consulate no longer. - Do we know each other? Oh, we'll meet now. Glad, that's it at last have managed to decide. In the time you needed to decide between big and small the market has fallen by 50 points. - Go on. Do not you have anything to say to me about this? - I am very sorry. Yes, I hope so, sir. Moccacino! Someone call the police! Attempted kidnapping at the Turkish consulate! Are you okay, Ogul? - Yes, Tanya. You have already rescued me. How do you do that? Her face is dirty, sir. Already gone. - Thank you. Gentlemen and Tanya, I want to introduce you to Wes Thompson, President of Continental Titanium. Mr. Thompson, These are the best bodyguards and security professionals, which you can buy with money. Very pleased, lady. So you are also an agent? I am. I am glad. Let's see if your people really as taffy as you say. Not so tight, Tanya. If you break his hand, he can not sign the contract. - Sir. You can grab. Well, I see, I'm right with you. So the situation. This is a routine task. You understand, I have a large number of business opponents. Happens, if you make your way up. You know, you have to smash eggs, if you want an omelet. Now it looks like one of those eggs returns to the nest, so to speak. And now you want us to protect you. - No, not me. Oh, Sally, it's all perfect with the wedding preparations. - You. Daddy and I are gone through the offers of the caterers, and we already know who it will be. London Catering, of course. And I'm at Neiman's right now seen the most precious gift basket. You can die for that. - Stop it, Daisy. We came here because of you. Same, Daddy, one second. Listen, Sally, it's going to be so exciting It could not go better. My company has gone off like a rocket, we are planning a billion-dollar takeover. And my little girl will marry. Everything was perfect, until then this turned up. It started a few days ago. Who does something like that? Who threatens the life of my little one Girl a week before the wedding? Besides the business opponents, is there anyone who would not treat her? Friends, family members Listen, lady, the Thompson clan may be a bit eccentric, but we are not sick guys. Sir, the first principle In personal protection means: nothing is impossible. We will take a closer look. The police have you not yet turned on, right? Do it if you think it necessary. But for now, it's important that we keep the matter secret. It is a very sensitive time, the acquisition. I definitely do not want that the partners are unsettled. I need the best. That's why we're here. Sweetheart? One second. We celebrate the wedding on our estate. A wedding in the old Texas style. The festival lasts a full five days. Here in our good old California. A little intimate affair, only family and close friends. I do not want to take any risks. We lost her mother, a few years ago. And Daisy is the most important thing for me. Nothing, but absolutely nothing means more to me than my little girl. Sorry, Daddy, Sally did not want to stop to talk. But she likes my idea. So, instead of at the wedding banquet just to have flowers on the tables, how about bears? Which one do I take? The wedding bear or the Buffalo Bobby Bear. No idea. Oh, and Daddy, The wedding planner had a great idea. So, the lettering "Love forever" in pink roses at the entrance and carnation flowers in the form of a heart at the altar. What are you saying? - Yes, whatever you want, sweetheart. What a day. I do not know where my head is. What is this about? Photographers or decorators? They do not look like decorators. - No honey, these are the security people. Darling, we want to be sure that runs smoothly at your wedding. Is it about these papers? Why this whole vortex? Someone has a fun, that's all. I want to be sure, nobody cares you even a hair your pretty head is bending. - You do not have to worry. We always have a team in the environment and a team directly at the client. Nobody can get too close to your daughter. - What? No way! Baby! Daisy, honey! Daddy, I do not want a bunch of gorilla guys, who are wallowing around me. That breaks the wedding. - We spoke about it. - Yes, but I did not think that a whole armada of James Bond agents comes to my wedding party. That totally ruins the atmosphere. Be sensible, sweetheart. - Daddy, a wedding is about love, for dedication, for commonality. Not about any with steroids inflated bodysuits, - seriously? The groping the bridesmaids! sweetheart Pretty spoiled princess. You know, Tanya, you can never to judge a book by its cover. This cover is an insult to books. She is under great pressure. - That's understandable. We have to handle that without compromising safety. I do not admit that my daughter an attacker is defenseless. To our job to be able to execute effectively we need unrestricted access to the client. We could disguise our team as a caterer. That would only be temporary. I would like, that there is always someone at your side If discretion is a must and it should also be unobtrusive at the same time maybe we could undercover someone as a wedding guest. Continue. - If you want someone being with the bride all week, why not a groomsman, or better, a bridesmaid. She is always at her side, at the Events, the parties, the food. Someone who is perfect integrated and not noticeable. Someone who is - As. I beg your pardon? - That's perfect. - no. They are constantly with the bride, without arousing suspicion. And the rest of the team can hold in the background, until they are needed. You are just one of the girls and could all scrutinize approaching Daisy on more than 10 steps. Yes, I can sell Daisy. - Then we have a deal now. Sir, I do not want to do that. I can not. Prince Vandar come to town next week. That can also do Danforth. Tanja, this is far too important. Thompson is a crucial client for us. - I know that. And you know, I would go through the fire for a client, just not in front of the wedding altar. Send me abroad, to protect a greedy dictator. I am also ready, Protect witnesses from the mob. I take care of myself again Gary Busey. Alone, if you ask me to. But please spare me hereby. I can not stand it. But you have to go through that, Tanya. He wants the best. And his company wants after successful takeover a million-dollar contract complete with a security company. Sir, you might know something. Weddings and me are not very good at it. Why not? - I do not want to go into that. Tanya, you are a professional, right? They are made for great things, maybe also for a partnership. But first and foremost follow instructions. So, for clarification. Someone is trying to prevent this wedding and you will see to it smoothly and without interference taking place. But, sir - Think about it. If you do not want to do it, I expect your answer at the latest tomorrow. Stop firing. Unload weapon. The passage is over. You killed the groom. Do you want to talk about it? - no. I just can not believe that Chesterton puts me to the election. My job or this job. - This is an ascent. You lead your own team. - That is not all. He even offered to become a partner, when I do this job. Hey, then do it. I do not know where the problem is. The wedding is the problem. You know, do not you, how much I hate weddings. Really! Honestly, I can not do that. - Clearly you can do that. You just always have to Think of the mustard seed. - To what? Well, even the faith, so big like a mustard seed, can move mountains. Thanks for feeding, Henry. But weddings I swore for all time. What's wrong with that, Tanya? Come on! I lead your background team, and we are right there, if you need a shoulder to cry, or to break. How is it looking? - I have never rejected a job before. What do I hear now? - Stop it! - What do I hear? Okay, I'll do it. But I do not wear chiffon, right? That's what you wear. Hi, darling, this is Mom. I hope You'll be visiting again soon. I just wanted to tell you that I know about "you know who" read something in the business section. You're a hundred times better off without him. By the way, your dad was bitten by the cat again. I love you. Do you want, Tanya, the Kevin present here to take husband, love and honor him, until death divides you? And if I want. Do you want, Kevin, take the Tanya present here as a wife, love and honor them, until death divides you? I Tell me. Do not fool around, Kevin. I Tanya, me I can not. I have to go. That is unbelievable. - Is that a joke or what? Hi! Pick-up service! You have to be Tanya. I'm Sally, and that's Kimmy. We want to collect you. - Come on board! - How exciting. The three bridesmaids are in a good mood and ready for her performance. I think our bridesmaid dresses are great. And how. You must like them too, Tanya. As long as I do not be confused with the wedding cake. She is funny. I like her. Oh, Tanya, you are right for us. Here, we must not forget that. Another bridesmaid. Hello! Oh really, I can not remember you anymore. But I feel like I am you have known all my life I am Daisy's Aunt Helen. And I'm so happy that you came to the wedding. Tanya! Listen, as my bridesmaid At least you could try to smile. That's my smile. - The bridesmaids help the bride, to make a special day and do not bargot your teeth. Believe me, as long as I only Teeth fletsche, that is less painful. I do my best. Patrick Andrews! Oh my God! - Daisy! I can not believe that you are already getting married. And then look who's still there. Oh, Mr Bosworth! - How are you, Daisy? My congratulations. Many Thanks. It's so nice that you are here. Oh, may I give you one introduce my bridesmaids? Tanya. Tanya, that's Mr Bosworth, the business partner of my father. Was, dear. I was your father's business partner. In the meantime, I have resigned. I am very pleased. - Me too. Aunt, do not play the inconspicuous purple spot! Come here and talk to Tanya! We met already. What are you for a pretty thing! If you are not careful, then we will meet you during the week still with someone verkuppeln. I see, that you do not yet wear a ring on your finger. We have to do something about that. - Perhaps look at the wrong finger. The supporter team has gone into position. We work from a catering van outside at the delivery entrance. That's our base, so to speak. And your guests will not notice that we are there. We have the room for you finished right next to Daisy. Then you can keep an eye on them. - Do not I have any privacy anymore? We do not know yet, what we are dealing with. It could be a single madman or even a group of professionals. Everyone is suspicious at this point. So, the fewer people know about us, the better. Can I at least mine - Would you please help us to do our job, and not tell anyone? Good, if you say that but I still do not understand what is the whole thing. - Yes, and, Daisy, I beg you, to wear this. This is a tracking transmitter with GPS support. This bites me totally with my outfit. - Your blood too. So, whenever you need me, just press this button here and I'll be there in 30 seconds. OK? - Okay. A message. Carlo is here. Exactly there. - Carlo! Buongiorno! Bellissima. Bella Bianca, all in white for wedding. I want white silk. There and there too. The will flank the swans and the white horses, if they pull the carriage, no? A beautiful idea. - Yes. The plants must all go out! I just want to see white! White roses! Madness! Hi. - Hi. - The safety precautions here are poor. We have a goal, that falls off its hinges, and a wall, which is good for decoration at best. We need motion detectors around the property, and I would say Cameras on all four sides. Will be done. Here, your earplug. - Oh yeah. Transmitter. Really pretty. Thank you. - Yes. Who is there? Pookie! - Pookie. - Hey! Oh, Chip, honey, I want you introduce my old friend from college. Tanya, she is one of my bridesmaids. - Hi. - Hi. And my congratulations for your big day. Man! Careful with the golf bag, the driver costs two giants! I'm terribly sorry, sir. This will be great fun. - Yes, I'm so glad you came. Oh, Betsy, may I introduce you to Tanya? A roommate from college. - Hi. And I am glad that she too as one of my bridesmaids is here. We have been best friends for ages. - Yes, since the first grade. No, since the kindergarten. - Betsy is our mother hen. And when she says "kindergarten", then it is like that. You already know Sally and Kimmy. - Oh, God, that's going to be gigantic. Can you? feel the excitement? OK. First, the bridal party, then we sip the champagne and then we check the guys! This will be great fun! Tanya? Screech. Tanya, Tanya, that's funny. I can not remember, ever heard of you. Oh, Daisy and me were only one month roommates. Then I changed to college. But of course we decided Stay in Touch. Because hello-o F-w-e F-w-e. Wow! - Friendship lasts forever. Very good move. Here are the boys. Hey boys! - What's up buddy? Oh, people! As in Daytona Beach. - Hi! Come here! - Hey! - Here are the girls. Who does not know the guys yet Rich, Vince, my little brother Robbie And the guy here is my best friend Jake. Girls, I am glad to see you again. Jake, Robbie, may I introduce Tanya? Tanya is the last access in the bridesmaid office. She is new to the city. Hi. - Hi. Hi. Jake. I hope you know what you did to yourself. This gang is already planning the wedding, since I was in 4th grade. Jake is studying law at Vanderbilt. - Really? - What are you doing, Tanya? I'm curious. - I - She is a kindergarten teacher. Pretty hard. - Is not that cute? That's such a nice job. Do you like it? Well, it's like being the mother of 20 children at the same time. Well said. I'll go in then. - Bye, Tanya. She is really nice. - Seems pretty taffy. - I like her. Already settled? - Probably not. Do we already have an analysis? the party participant? Yes, we have the connection. Well. Let's take a look. Reads himself like a "who's who" of millionaire children. What do we have about the bridesmaids? - Food only from silver spoons. None of them ever worked one day. Betsy Monroe. She is practically America's aristocracy. She can change her lineage attributed two different presidents. Filthy rich. Her family owns companies, that make pretty much everything, from watches to wedding cakes. Mega coal. Yes, she looks funny, at least to me. Keep an eye on her. What about the wedding planner? Carlo Santi. He used to go to the Thompsons started with corporate events. But now also makes weddings. Has a pretty big customer list. Seems to be okay. The witnesses are buddies from college. No angels, but during spring break something about the severity. And what about our lover boy? - The groom? Daddy manages a hedge fund, and Junior is employed as V.I.P. Specialist. Translation? He spends his time in polo, rugby and loses his money in horse racing. A real heartthrob in college. Clear. - He is nesting. Fits to him. And his best friend Jake? - Good that you ask. She said, he is studying law at Vanderbilt. I checked the registration, and he does not study law there. I have not found it anywhere else either. Well, I keep digging. Interesting. Please do not behave like a bodyguard. - Yes, okay. Do you have a weapon? Not? Oh no! There's chips mother. Protect me. - Why, what's up with her? See you soon. Hello, Constance. Daisy, you have to tell your dad he should fire your gardener. The lawn is simple and simple a weed jungle. Oh, of course. May I give you one introduce my bridesmaids? Tanya. Hello, I'm glad. - Pretty. Chip, darling, you have to show me the tux, you will wear to the wedding. - We have to look, if it has already been delivered. - What, not yet? - After you. Wow! Very friendly. - My future mother-in-law. She thinks, Chip could make a better match. I'm only good for 50 million. I guess you'd rather Chip would marry a DuPont. - May I ask for your attention? We would like to thank you, that you have to this happy occasion have come to us. I tell you, rest, because we have many events, that lie ahead of us. For example football. Tomorrow morning. An old Thompson tradition. This is our year, people. This time we'll pack it. Henry, we have to do something with the trees in sector L 5 . They provide a perfect overview, if we have it to deal with a shooter. Being done, Tanya. Now dive in. Who knows, maybe there is one for you too. Sorry. BVG Did you speak with your hand? Oh, me among so many people I am always a bit shy. That's why I'm testing, what I want to say. Are you studying law? - Actually, the Daisy said. How's it going? - Oh good. I I find such a wedding has something special. Not romantically? Strangers meet, fall in love. It's like Noah's Ark. The animals always come in pairs in the boat. What is going on in these people's minds? - Me I already had three old ladies and a WWII general, me with a bridesmaid wanted to get involved. I swear, when another comes, I give myself beaten. Final. Keep telling. - Why do some people have to the opportunity always use the same for a wedding, around singles in the area of 300 miles to pair up? I do not know. But I know exactly what you mean. I did not know that you can laugh too. - I do not do. And? How is it going? - I have the best time of my life. Do not eat things like that in yourself. Do not want to see what happens when you explode. - very funny. Do you have more information? about Robbie, the little brother? No, but I have something learn about cousin Eldridge. He and Daisy would divide the family company. But if Daisy and Chip Have children, turns half of a third. That's a 10 million loss. Inheritance, that would be a good motive. We also have the mother-in-law, who believes that no one is good enough for her angel. There is one more. Bosworth, Thompson's business partner. He did not go voluntarily. He was pushed. - For the takeover to pass? Bingo. And Aunt Helen. She manages the Family Education Fund. You should rather him call the Jewelery Fund. But he's dry since Thompson does not sponsor him anymore. - Revenge? She does not seem to be the type for me but you never know what people are capable of. What about our student? Jake. Nothing so far. Since he's high school left a few years ago, he does not seem to exist anymore. - Keep searching, yes? There's something about this guy that lets me assume that he is not that what he claims to be. I do not know what, but do you hear? What? I do not hear anything. - Just it. The crickets are no longer heard. There. A burglar on the east wing. Follow him. I cut off his path. Man! What are you doing there? I asked Claire to help me find my contact lens. I have to go somewhere lost here at the pool. Did you just see someone here? - no. As I said, I miss the contact lens. - Right. Thank you. Tanya, he disappeared. - What? Did you recognize who it was? - no. But I think, I have just the groom caught with an employee. Are you sure? - Yes, pretty sure. Wow! What is all this? - We are leaving for the last time. The boutique has sent stuff that we may need. Why go shopping, when shopping comes to you? Only a few things. When you're done, Let's check all the ways. Hello. You are the only bridesmaid which is not completely electrified. Certainly we still find something nice for you. No, I do not think so. - Tanya, your attitude. ladys This is my last fitting. This is important. You know, I would welcome it, if you want something more in your attitude would work. - I work hard. I work hard To protect you in the background. Do not you understand? As a bridesmaid do you depend on the other girls makes nonsense, talks about guys and clothes. You can do that, right? Adapt or you end up as a wallflower. - As what? I'm sorry. - Maybe that sounds a bit cheesy, but to be bridesmaid is a sacred duty. An honor, something very special. So, help me, a garter to find, and I am prepared. Oh my God! Oh! Just look this adorable little pillow! Oh! We already have one. But is not that adorable? I do not really know - Oh, my God, is not that adorable? How should I explain this to you? So, you shop, and I protect you. By the way, you master any kind of self-defense? I raised my elbow as me wanted to grab a bag. Well. - Oh my God! That's insane. But not before the honeymoon. We are waiting. - Honestly? What do you think if the chip is like? I think Chip likes a lot. - Yes, he is really very open-minded. One of the things that I love about him. - Are you sure that he is the right person? Of course I'm sure. What is the stupid question? You do not really know him, right? - What do you mean? I mean, I'm here for giving you hurts coming through your wedding party. Oh, my God, we are too late to football! Come! It is so far! Long live the family tradition. We play football. You are with us. - Do not you have girls? Afraid to get hurt before the wedding? There are only two things that really interest us Texas girls. The semi-annual sale at Neiman's and Football. Are the teams ready? - Yes, let's start! Wait. I'm getting Tanya. - Sorry, bro, that's on our side. I would like to play with Daisy. - Okay. Then I get a chip. - Yes. Contact lens found? Hey, good luck. Your page has no chance. In this exam, Law student, you rattle through. Hat, hat, hat! I have that! Very quiet, Bosworth. - What's up, Thompson? Do you think I am no longer able to fight, since I'm no longer in the store? Hat, hat, hat! Young man, You have the decency of an ox! I'm sorry. Go on! - hat, hat, hat! Look there! - Thanks, Daisy. Here! Not my day. Who comes now? I try it. Nice that I'm allowed to participate. Oh, we love pretty ladies. You just can not do that shoot in the back. Shoot in the back is more of a character trait the Thompson family, right? - So, Tanya, before the disc comes, you have to keep the run absolutely straight. Can you see it? Yes, but remember the mouth should always point down, until you are ready. Press firmly on the shoulder. And do not tear the trigger, but press gently. Roger that. Thank's for the Tipps. Nice to have you here. Daisy says that you will retire soon. Do not believe everything you hear. Okay, let's go, Tanya! You dont need to be scared. OK. Pull! Uh-oh! I suppose that did not work. - Do not worry, honey, they are clay pigeons, they do not feel anything. Do not forget the muzzle end that's what you shoot. It's okay, sweetheart, is also more of a men's sport. Hell, my wife would not even to hit a barn door, even if she stood in front of it. Double Pull! Oh, man, only beginner luck, probably. Oh, so late. I still miss the bridal shower. I wish the men a lot of fun. Wait until you see my shoes. You will die. Oh, madness! - I have a lot of surprises. Do you have games too? - You know Sally. Games? - Naturally. Sally is the queen of the organization. For one we need - Oh, I love that. A bridal party to get to know is such a great idea. Yes. Now only have to the boys are there, and who knows, ladies, Maybe there's a double wedding. Interested persons? Between you and Jake appeared this morning at football to vote the chemistry yes. - no. - Time for our favorite pastime. We ask a question and answer in a circle. We do that since we were kids. And, Tanya, you're one of us now. So you're there too. Ladys, what's up for you the most beautiful at a wedding? For me it's the hair. All hairstyles are just perfect on the wedding day. I swarm for lace. To me only the love oath comes into question. I especially like the witnesses. Tanya, what's up for a wedding? always the best? Oh, that's hard to say. But a fantastic question. The most beautiful thing for me is the bouquet. Because I love roses, romantically tied, to a bouquet, with the bond of togetherness. Is not that cute? Where we talk about commonality, Let's start with the bridal games! Okay, it's time for the wedding dress. We only use toilet paper and make a wedding dress out of it for the cardboard bride. OK? Come on! Okay, and now we have the Adonis balloon. The first, the dream types Balloon won, okay? Here. Oh, my uncle was a knife thrower in the circus. Yes, it goes without saying. - Now it's around. - Ladies? Now the party is really getting started. - Hi. - Hey boys. Hey, Tanya! At some point I will get you on my side. - Really? How do you like it here? - I think it's great. Thank you. Do you know if Jake is from the area? Yes, that's from here. I myself come from Long Island. But the people here know how to party. - Yes, definitely. How did you meet? My family owns a property on Palm Beach. Maybe you'll visit me there. I'll show you the area. Say, Robbie, I have just seen, that you are the waitress smiled at the back. She has to have a crush on you. - Do you think? Yes. Hurry up. I'm sorry. And? How do you get life in the midst of the landed gentry? Oh, very good, thanks. And? Are you studying law? Is that important? - What do you think? Whether I am a law student? I mean, we would talk, if I were a garbage man? - It was just a question. Or are you hiding something? - You ask too many questions. I'm just a curious guy. - I'm sorry, but I'm sick of it, that my fortune decides whether a conversation lasts longer than a "hello". How do you feel that I am such a person? - Take a look around! You never know. Just take Betsy there as an example. Did you know that she and Chip were in college together? But she had first left him until she has his name. But I am not like that. Would you maybe dance with me? - no. Certainly not. Well, maybe you change your mind. I do not want, that you embarrass me at my wedding, by standing on the side like a wallflower. That is what you are doing. - That's not part of my job description. I'm here, because I have to take care of you. It's also possible with a smile. Come! Go to him already! Come! - Yes, but - Well, go! OK. I am ready to give it a try. Really? Do you do that more often, that you try, To impress women on the dance floor? Why not? Works. Your best friend likes to take a look out the window. Chip? No. He is as loyal as a dog. Believe me, he loves Daisy. Well, let's hope. Well! Come on, Tanya! That's all? Am I wrong? I never mislead me in the end. Come on, Daisy. Wake up, the guy is playing wrong. Hey! Why are you doing this? - Because you have sneaked up on me. No. I did not rank myself. - But. No. I said "Hey". This is not the same as sneaking up. I'm sorry, I was scared. - Yes, you are very pale. And What do you want with the binoculars? - I watch birds. Yes, I watch birds. The kids like it. A tensioner? No. - Tanya, hey, hey! That was fun, nothing else. - I have to go. Watch out for the black-throated night swallows. - Wait, Tanya, wait! Why are you always running away? Tanya! Funny insert. No, that was embarrassing. Where is Daisy going? She went in with her sweetheart. I think they are in the south wing. That's Daisy's alarm. I'm on the road. Check the property! Immediately! Daisy! - Tanya! Listen, we are busy. - Tanya, what are you doing here? Well, not a moment too soon how I see it, right? Not before the wedding. - We just kiss. Yes, that's how it always starts. - That should be a joke. Maybe she's right. - You heard her. The rest follows in the wedding night. - I am sorry. I have to sound the alarm by mistake have triggered. - That was close. Oh my God! Have you seen chips face? Yes, not exactly overjoyed. Thanks, Tanya, that's all went a little further than I had planned. Really? Why did not you just say something? You prevail, when it comes to wedding planning. You also have to be with the people push through. - I know, but me You are so confident. - But that was not always like that. Believe me. - no? No. Please, do not the same mistake as me, Daisy. What happened? What? I understand. That's why you hate weddings so much. You know, It's not about me at all. Come, Tanya! Does she have one? sitting in front of the altar? Oh my God! Tanya, I'm so sorry, really. That's fine. Just take care of yourself, okay? And I take care of you too. Maybe you should rest a bit. The many festivals before the wedding are very exhausting. - Something comes to mind. For the brunch that my family organized tomorrow for the relatives Do you have something to wear? I have my black Chanel costume. - Nope. That should be a bit more summery. Here, try this! I saw it and thought, that would be great for you. It would have to fit. Thank you. - I thank you. Guys, do you have to do everything yourself? Is a disaster! Where are the flowers that I ordered? Oh, madam, your hair is a bit higher! Thank you. Oh, here comes the bride! Here comes the bride! Ciao. Good morning, Mr. Enigmatic. - Good morning, Mrs. Judo. You look exciting. - Thank you. - And there she goes. Run away from me again. Do I talk to myself? Excuse me, do you have canapés? - Yes, ma'am. They are spicy. Much cayenne in it. Oh, Henry, you are a natural. So, what do we have on the plan today? First, the brunch for the relatives and then the Hen party at 5pm. And the hay cart ride. At 22 o clock. - Hay Cart? That will be interesting. - Do you want some gossip for tea? Well, and how. Cousin Eldridge. Who is sitting in the photo with him? Is that Leo Simons, the billionaire? Yes, that's Thompsons Main competitor in the acquisition. I think you want to tell me Cousin Eldridge lives beyond his means and urgently needs cash. - He gets 20 giants a month and needs twice as much. - Attention, 6 o'clock. So, Daisy, I have to say this hors d'oeuvre is interesting. Thank you. I left the boss fly in from Maxims for him to prepare. Glad you like her. - Oh, who says I like her? I just said, they are interesting. What about the mother-in-law? Do you think she would to get your hands dirty so Daisy disappears from the scene? Well, she has magazine snippets and a pair of scissors in the bag, though I do not think so, that she sent the notes. I can imagine that she is Daisy displaced from the country club, because she is wearing a Dior dress from last year. But a murderer? I can not imagine. Dive? Ciao. But I only ask for a small cash injection, nothing more. Do not forget, this educational fund Honor the whole Thompson family. And we are almost bankrupt. Every penny is now for the takeover second hand. - quarrel in the vegetable garden. That's not a good time. I had to sell the Nebraska Railway Company, to have enough cash. I had to confess to the shareholders You neglect the family, and you still regret it. So what's going on? Is Aunt Helen angry because of something? No, she is just a little tense lately. Everything OK. Virgin invasion. Oh, honey! Would you like to talk to us? I do not understand. What do you all mean? Sally says we want you to know You know, we are so sorry. What? - We know about everything. How you were allowed to sit. Right at the altar, that's horrible. - That's so tragic. Yes, but we want you to know that we are always there for you. Let's do it. - sister hearts. You are one of us now. Thank you. I can not believe that you have told everyone I did not tell you that you mean mine Bodyguard is just what you went through. Tanya, we are friends. You have such a heavy burden but do not wear alone. Also bodyguards need a shoulder to cry. - No, listen! That's not how it works, okay? You are the client, I am the bodyguard. You are not here for to buy me pretty clothes or sisterly heart pressures to organize, and especially not your bridesmaids to tell my personal problems. OK. So, what are we doing here now? Something I unbelievable find relaxing. I show it to you. OK, pay attention! We fill small bags of lavender and roses, with it the tables smell good at the wedding afterwards. Then I tie a little pink ribbon around and Voila! Try using! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I know, I chatted. This will never happen again. But what happened at the wedding? Oh you know, I was young and completely naive. And Kevin was attractive. I should have been startled, because he always tried to postpone the wedding date. But I was so busy with the wedding, that I did not notice the signs. Finally, I stood there with a bunch of gifts, which I had to return. And he left my maid of honor. Wow! Tanya, I'm really sorry. - No, alright. You know what? I think, Kevin did you a favor. As the? - I have a good intuition. And I think you'll do something better. I do not know, but okay. May I give you some advice? - Do I have another choice? You have to try to forgive him. Promise me you'll try. Tanya, please! I try it. I think we both might have one another judged something too premature, right? I know, it is not easy for you to be here between this wedding stuff and stuff, but I am glad that you are there. Tanya, meeting in the Texas room. - Yes immediately. Be right back. Home on the ranch does not mean I can not find you. A gardener thought so outside in a flowerpot. And this time was also a cartridge case. Someone has fun with this game. That's enough. We say all activities until the wedding. - What? Darling, listen! - Stop with "darling"! I do not give up because of a stupid letter on my bachelorette party. I would even to crawl through a barbed wire fence, not to miss the party. And that's probably all. Tanya, stay by her side. Bachelorette party or not, stick to it! - We are also with the van and keep an eye on everything outside. - I expect you to be back in time. The hay wagon ride is at ten. Tanya, comes from a 38s. Should you be at the party? Keep that in mind tonight, okay? I think it's really funny here with you. Okay, a toast. On old friends and new! Cheers! - Cheers! Hey, Slim, where is the next round? I'd like to know, What Chip and the boys are doing today. Forget the guys! This is your bachelorette party. Betsy is right, Daisy. This is your last evening in freedom. Chip makes the best of it, and I think you should do that as well. Yes. - I could imagine, you would be a good Tammy Wynette. No. I sing? No. No, I need more fluent courage to do that. Bottles up! - Oh, I do not drink that much, otherwise I'll go crazy. We are not kindergartners, you have to take care of. Swallow up! Yes, I want to see the crazy Tanya. - Definitely not. Then you can us tell a little bit more about Jake. The guy seems to have done it to you. Well, I admit, he is very sweet. You know what? Now I am making a toast. I was a little scared, to be an outsider here. But you girls have me really great. Cheers! Thank you. - Cheers! - You are now part of the family. Or, girls? And I'll do the hair for the wedding. Deal? She gets a crazy Texas hairstyle, and that is a promise! Okay, ladies and gentlemen! Let's welcome our first karaoke star! Cowboy Bill! Hello friends! I will blow you away with my guns and some delicate tones! Come on, cowboy! You have a new worshiper. From tomorrow she is married! - Hey, shut up! Come on, sweetheart! I can not get the sounds alone! Come on, go up. Enjoy it. As you say, Tanya, I lose the freedom. Excellent! He can not sing at all. But with the muscles, what's up? Be kind, Daisy! Daisy! We just danced, Tanya. - Lady, why are you going for me? I could not control myself. They were so good. - Honestly? Yes. So your song, the movements, that confused me completely. You have something from Brad Paisley, I think. I do not care. Sorry. Go on! That was entertaining. - We have just seen the mad Tanya. Hey, I'm surprised. For one Kindergärtnerin you're pretty taff. Okay, girls! You have to lift one more. We'll meet in an hour with Chip and the boys. Good number, Tanya. Is not that insanely romantic? - Yes. - A hay cart ride with you all. Tanya, did you notice how great are all my friends? I hope you enjoy yourself. Hey, little lady, how are you? - I'm fine, Sheriff. You just want to cuddle, right? We do not need to pretend as if we were a couple. Glad to hear that. That's so tragic, darling. - Listen. The stock market? Oh thank you. We went swimming with Nebraska Pacific, So save your tips, Robbie. Robbie always desperately tries getting rid of his stock picks. You have hay on your hair. Wait! Look at the lovebirds. - Daisy. So, really, these brats are so curious, that drives me crazy. So much for the topic "Maintain myth". Forget it! It does not work. - Really? You seem to be pretty good on it. - Do you find? Clear. Law student. No money. You know, the exterior can be deceiving. Did you actually know that Daisy and me were together? - no. Do you have any reason to hope that the wedding can not take place? How so? He is my best friend. Believe me, Daisy and Chip are made for each other. You do not think that his gaze wanders too? - You know what? I think we should have the interrogation finish now, young lady. Think twice, before you throw it. You do not win the war. - Take your finger away! I have seen your judo arts and was not impressed. Do not do it. I'm warning you, do not do it. No! Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Peace. Hey, stop! Was really romantic. - Was a great carriage ride. What do we do now? Do we want to drink something? - Hey, shut up! A nightcap? - I could use a whiskey. Daisy, sweetheart, just got a package delivered for you. Here. This is defined a special wedding gift for you. I'm really curious. Grandma Smith? Till death do us part. Say it off. Henry, main entrance. Who gave that? That was a messenger with a motorcycle. He is still in front. Watch out for Daisy! - Did she just speak with her hand? Carlo! We have our husband. He confessed at once. But why did he do that? I do not understand his motive. That will be shown yet. Important is, that you caught the guy. Does anyone have that? heard of the wedding party? No, they were all already in there busy with their drinks. So, I think Your camouflage has not been revealed. But I will give a speech, so that no doubt arises. Good, I see, you have the situation under control, but by no means you may let it go. - Yes, sir. Until the wedding we are on standby. I want you all to know how happy we are for the first time in several weeks. Now I am calm. Now I want to make a toast. So, fill the glasses! It's so hard to believe that it was Carlo. He has the simple green tablecloths spiced up with aqua napkin rings. Who thinks that someone with so much taste is a criminal? Oh, well, who knows why do people do what they do? But no matter. You're doing well? - Yes. And I'm really so relieved that you got him. Now I can completely relax focus on my wedding. Did not you do it before? - Daisy, darling, please come to me! Everyone has? OK. I would like to thank a special person. Of course, next to my beloved daughter, namely our bridesmaid and girlfriend Tanya. For all who do not know it yet Last night she caught a real party crasher. Obviously our little celebration is in high demand. So we all start together, on our Tanya! On Tanya! - Cheers! And now we enjoy my daughter's wedding. I love you darling. Tanya! My buddy Jake is totally on you. Really? Why are you telling me this? I have known Jake since we were five. I know when he likes someone. I just wanted to tell you that I am happy about it. I do not like him me and Daisy looks happy all the time and even nobody has. Jake is a good guy. And what about you? Really ready to marry? There are enough possibilities here find out. I sometimes see pretty girl behind. But believe me, I have Daisy never cheated. Not really. No way. I got used to the idea only one woman for the whole To have life. That's scary. You should get used to that too, that means a marriage. I know. But I love Daisy. She is everything to me. She is the only woman for me. And I always want to be by her side. If that's really true, she is a very happy woman. All the best. Hey, Tanya! Do we want to go to the park? I should actually I should be with Daisy. Okay, I know that you and Daisy are good friends, but you can not even do it Leave alone for five minutes? I think she can take care of herself. I want to tell you something. So, what did you want to tell me? You have me all the time picked up because of my law school. Now I wanted to clear the table. So you lied. I am not a student. I have never studied law in my life. I got accepted, but I did not go. And I work in a supermarket. Where? A double life, why? No idea. I do not have that much coal like that. That is not completely right. I'm coming from a wealthy family, but I think I just want to do it myself. do you understand? I will study law at some point, but only if I can pay it myself. I think that's fantastic. This shows character and backbone, I think. I think you are fantastic. I should go back. - Oh, wait! Why are you always running away from me? Because I should be with Daisy. I promise you, Daisy is doing very well. But you are in serious danger. How so? - You miss your luck. Henry, shots at the south entrance! What's going on here? - Did not something happen to anyone? Daisy, all right? - Yes. Where were you? Daisy, are you hurt? No, I'm fine. I heard the shots and ducked me. - Good Good. Did something happen to someone? They should protect Daisy. - I know. I'm sorry. I was only in the park with Jake. My daughter is almost shot because you were flirting in the park! What kind of bodyguard are you? That makes no sense. - All right, darling? You are a bodyguard? Tanya! - Did he escape? There is nobody in or out of the property. It has to be someone that's already in here. Did you see something? No. I did not see anything. Go through everything. - Well. I want answers right now. Whoever says you are the best, They screwed up. Out with the language! - Sir, can we clarify that in private? - You can forget that. I want answers! Who did you exclude? Who is suspicious? What are you actually imagining? Someone wanted to murder Daisy. I want to know everything now. Immediately! Listen! At first I thought, it would be Bosworth, but in time did not skinny. Constance seemed suspicious but then I caught Chip with the staff, and I thought - What? What? You have a chip seen with an employee? Not really. - Not really? Why did not you tell me? I thought we were friends. Let's see if other security companies do their job better. Lady, you are fired! It can neither Constance still be Bosworth. We have them on the video all the time. And here is the video clip of the other night. Chip and the employee. Looks like chip really would have lost his contact lens. I was wrong. I was completely wrong with everything! I can not believe it, I disregarded the simplest basic rule. Get away from emotions do not obscure the view. Can you please make sure that Daisy sees the tape, So she knows that Chip did not do anything? I go home. And of course we expect you too are again numerous this summer. But now for the wedding, everyone is talking about right now. Of course, our holly is there. Yes, and the surprise the day is for all of us, That the wedding of Daisy Thompson and Chip Denver has been postponed to tomorrow. This blue-blooded wedding was planned yes for today. But then you decided to move it. And although the bride is practically up close surrounded by bodyguards, speaks for everything that it will be a great day for them. Back to the studio. I'm not there. Please leave a message. Hi, it's me, Daisy. I wanted to tell you, that I'm sorry how everything went. Call me. Bye. I have a new order. I just want to see how you're doing. Outstanding. You can see that. A completely normal day. Are you telling me why you want to break my joints? I only have to reduce some excess energy. Come on, Tanya! Calm down, for God's sake. Free up a few days. Fly to the Bahamas or something. I'm getting fit for the next fight, okay? I am worried. What do you want here? - Why did not you call back? I have ... you leave a dozen messages. I thought you were evil, because I was not honest. That's it. Then I'm just as guilty because I was not honest either. Jake, why are you here? - Because Daisy needs you. Okay, Henry showed her the tape. She knows that nothing happened between Chip and this girl. Where is the problem? She wants to talk to you, Tanya. - I think, I built enough crap with her. Then clean him up again. I can not, okay? I have to train. - All right, train! Well, go! Of course you also suspected me. Why not? After all, I was not honest with you. You just did your job. I got that. Besides, I'm here because the wedding takes place as planned. And I want to, that you accompany me as my partner. Listen, Jake! I think you're a really nice guy, okay? But I'm a security agent, and I messed up an order. I do not know if you know What that means for me. This has never happened to me. I want get my life back in gear. Focus on the work and try to get everything else out of my head! Got it? - Do you have the philosophy also heeded two years ago? Did that make you happy, Tanya? - Get lost! Tanya! Hey wait! Daisy asked me to give you that. She said you would understand. Something, how important it is to forgive. Listen, you can go to the wedding because of Daisy, who would like to have you as a friend. Or you go with me. Tell Daisy that I would like to congratulate her. Hi, I will not stay long. Tanya? - Hi Kevin. Wow, I have not seen you since, since - It's been a while. Are you doing well? - A little older, but not necessarily wiser. You look great. - Thank you. I heard, you are a special agent or something? Do not believe everything you hear. So that's your own restaurant now. You have done yourself. Yes, I have three restaurants, but most of the time I spend in the kitchen. And what brings you here? Oh, my mother told me from your new restaurant. I just wanted to congratulate you. I have a little gift. Thank you. It will not explode, right? When aprons explode - Thank you. You want to marry? - Yes, crazy. I am happy for you. - Thank you. I have to go. And I wish you the best of luck. Tanya, wait! You're welcome! It I'm really sorry for what happened. What is beautiful a small forgiveness among friends? Glad to be happy. Do not you want to stay for dinner? I make a stunning fish soup. No thanks. I meet up with friends. Then at least take a fresh muffin. On the go. You're welcome. Oh, please, do not tell me this is a bug. No, that's a mustard seed. Are you allergic? I'm sorry. I did not know No. No. Excuse me That is a long story. Thank you. Oh, Henry Bright sunshine. - That's Kelly and Ron. I do not know. Yes, perhaps. - I am not sure.

Once together. - Yes. I wish Tanya was here. - How so? She just made trouble, Daisy. Do not forget, this is your special day and everything is perfect. I know, but somehow - I'm sorry all this hype about the wedding. I mean, the security issues, but now we are - No, Daddy, That's not it. It is Tanya. She is my girlfriend. Oh my God, I hope that's not the bridegroom. Who's there? - Jake. - Should come in. Hi. Somebody wants to talk to you. You? We do not need your services anymore. We met other arrangements. I can assure you, Mr Thompson, I'm really private here. Well, I'm here exactly How should I say, for my girlfriend. Tanya, I am so happy that you are here. Oh, that's nice to hear. I got three tickets, to be here in time. - My make-up is over. You were right with me protect and control my feelings. I'm sorry. And even though I really hate weddings, I wanted on your very special day but like to be there. Besides, someone once told me to be that bridesmaid it is a sacred duty and an honor. Thank you, Tanya. But I do not know if that's right. Daisy! Hey, Chip did not do anything. Henry saw the videos. I was completely wrong. Yes, but I heard how you talked about it, that he looks after other girls and - Did you hear the whole conversation? Because then Chip told me that he is only in love with you. And that's it all over the world no other girl for him. And that only he want to be with you. And I believe him. - Do you really mean? - Yes. Darling, we have to! - no. Not without my new bridesmaid. - Agreed. You are really the biggest. Is he crying? - I told you, he's a softie. Keep your mouth shut! I have only one allergy. Hey, are you crying?

Dear bridal couple, we are today in the name of God, around this young couple to accompany in the state of marriage. Daisy and Chip are a couple, that is made for each other. And this is a happy day for the two. The stock market? Oh, thank you. We went swimming with Nebraska Pacific, So save your tips, Robbie. I had to sell the Nebraska Railway Company, to have enough cash. I had to get the shareholders, you can not imagine that. And now, Daisy will take the vow that she wrote herself. Betsy Monroe. It is practical America's aristocracy. Filthy rich. My beloved chip Just take Betsy there as an example. Did you know that she and Chip were in college together? But she had left him first, until she knows his name. And I swear to love you always through all the sun's rays and thunderstorms of our lives. Madam, madam, your hair is a bit higher! Carlo. And I solemnly swear, always only to love you. Your family owns companies who make just about anything, from watches to wedding cakes. If someone has reasons to why these two not to marry, Now talk or be silent forever. All men down! Come on! Get down! What's going on there? Betsy! Someone has to stop them! Stop them! I do not believe that. You really wanted to kill me? Why not? You ruined my life, Daisy. You're the one who gets chip, and you do not need his money at all. But me, since your dad ruined my family. You get everything, and I can not get anything! But, Betsy, we swore Being girlfriends for life. Yes. - But that's over! What was that? Left hook. Kind. Very nice.

Just like unicorns accompany me in my joy, like rainbow to illuminate our common path, I know that the feelings, that I share with my love, will continue, our whole life. My lady. OK. One last question. Then I will stop. - Tell me! Are you now cured of your wedding phobia? No bad memories anymore the last time, no lasting guilt feelings? Should I be completely honest? I want to now in no place in this world would you rather be to dance here with you - Oh, my God, beware! You did that on purpose. - Trapped is trapped. By now Betsy confessed everything. The instigation of the wedding planner, the threats What was with Carlo? - Betsy has Carlo just wrapped around the little finger. She pretended to him that she had fallen in love with him, and he fell for it. They will both be long for a while disappear from the scene. Wow, American Royalty! What are they going to do next? Let's work, maybe. Cousin Eldridge has at least given up his playboy life. That's why he's with the Takeover alums hit by Thompson. That's good for him. Hey, what about Constance?
