(soft dramatic music) - [Voiceover] Krebs went to the war from a Methodist college in Kansas. There is a picture of him which shows him among his fraternity brothers. Many of them went, too. (military march music) (explosion) (dramatic music) (explosion) (dramatic music) Krebs did not return until the Second Division returned from the Rhine in late 1919. By the time he returned to his hometown, the greeting of heroes was over. He had come back too late. The town had returned to its usual patterns. But, that was all right with Krebs. He'd fought well. He felt clean and pure inside. He had done the one thing a man should do in battle. Now, he just needs some time to sort things out. - Son, you smoke lots in battle? You seem to do it naturally. - Not really. I just picked it up. - Did you actually smoke in the war, Har? Didn't they see you lighting up? The Germans? - We smoked mostly when we were bored. - Bored? Little chance you had to be bored. - We were. I was. A lot of the time. - Well, you must be tired, Harold. All that traveling and we've asked you so many questions. - I'm fine. - Well, it's getting late. I've got to go out to County tomorrow. We'll get to talk about what you want to be doing. Plenty of time. - Yes. I'll need a week or so. - Of course. Let's just be thankful you're home safe. Let's all give thanks to our dear Lord that you're back home. Oh, Harold. We did pray for you and every Sunday, Reverend Nelson made a special point-- - Folks, I've got to go on up. Welcome home, Harold. - Goodnight, Dad. It was a fine dinner. I guess I'll go on up, too. - Son? Margie and I can fix you a special breakfast and serve it to you in bed. You remember when you used to have those awful winter coughs and I used to bring you up a bowl of hot oatmeal? - Not tomorrow, Mom. I want to get up early. - Harold? You sleep well. - I will. Thanks, for everything. (soft sentimental music) (jaunty ragtime music) (train whistle blowing) - Morning, young Krebs. Welcome home. How long are you back now? - [Harold] Two weeks today. - Your folks tell me you had a mighty difficult time over there. - No, not that bad. - Oh. Well, anyhow, you must be glad to be home. Planning to go back to school soon? - No. - Oh, you're going to be selling farm land with your dad at the bank? It's always a blessing when a father and son-- - Excuse me. - You'd think he'd killed the Kaiser. That young boy, always more uppity than anyone else in town. (upbeat ragtime music) (car horn honking) - Krebs? Are you Harold Krebs? - Yes, that's me. - Do you remember me? I'm Mr. Phillips. I was your youth group advisor in the lower grades. - Sorry, I was involved with these books. - Are you an avid reader? Have you tried the new Booth Tarkington? I try to encourage good reading. My heavens, all these books are about the war. I would have thought you'd want to forget. - It helps to make sense out of the things that happened. Maps give me a better idea of the campaign. - Weren't you in the Argonne? My Lord, the reports we had were absolutely horrible. - Thanks. I'd like them for two weeks, or longer. Two weeks, that's all that's allowed. Krebs? Krebs, you might want to check the social calendar on your way out of the building. We have socials and dances for the young vets so they can catch up with the community activities. This Friday we have-- - Thanks. I'll take a look. - [Mother] You recognize some of these pictures, Harold? - Not specifically, but I'm beginning to get an idea of where I was in the campaign. - Is that your map from the war? - Here's where our trenches were, and here's where we had our heaviest losses. - Oh, the McDonald boy was killed over there. I had a talk with your father last night, Harold, and he's willing for you to take the car out in the evening. - Yeah? Take the car out? (laughing) - Yeah. Your father's felt for some time that you should be able to take the car out in the evenings whenever you wish, but we just talked it over this evening. - I'll bet you made him. - Well, he suggested that we talk it over. We're going to have dinner a little early this evening. - All right. I think I'll walk a little. - Now, don't be late. I've made your favorite roast. - All right. - [Tom] Six ball, Brian. Harold? - What's going on, Tom? - Harold? Army beefed you up some. 145 pounds, huh? - Excuse me. - Looking a little beefy yourself. (chuckling) Looking good, Harold. - Hey, Harold? Run 'em all. One, two, three, the way you used to. (pool balls cracking) - Hey, Harold, bet you didn't have no time for pool in France, huh? Did you? - Nope. Not much time for pool. - Hey, Harold, is it true you came home last because they kept the best soldiers around? You know, to keep the Krauts in line? (pool balls rumbling) - Harold? Did you really kill Germans? Face to face? Honest? God. With bayonets? - That's what we went there for. Not to see the Eiffel Tower. (jaunty upbeat music) - Sorry. - Oh, sorry, I wasn't looking-- Krebs? Harold Krebs? When did you get back? - Just two weeks now. - Well, you look fine, just fine. - Thanks. - You working for your dad at the bank? - Not yet. - You interested in a permanent line of work? - I might be. - I'm doing fine selling insurance. The vets are interested and need the security. They know the future. - Makes sense. - [Charlie] Think you'd be interested? - Buying some? - [Charlie] Well, naturally that, and maybe working with me on the selling part. - I'll think about it. I'm late for dinner. - Hey, did you hear I'm married now? Remember Edith Hayes? She was our class secretary. - Good luck, Charlie. - And the prettiest girl in town. (sentimental piano music) (knocking) - Come on. - Krebs? Harold Krebs. Remember me? Bill Kenner? A fellow sufferer in geometry and Latin. - Sure, Bill Kenner. I remember you. - Come here, my lovelies. - You all right? - Yeah, sure. Using a part of your knee on a mine is all right. I'm just fine. - That's too bad. You seem to be doing well, though. - Well, lovelies like these? (speaking French) Know what I mean? - I guess. - You guess. (chuckling) Say, we're lucky to be alive. You know this little town had three killed? Lots injured. Why, in our graduating class alone there were seven casualties. This lovely mademoiselle a Krebs? (chuckling) May I introduce myself? - Let's go, Har. - Well. Bye, Bill. - Is that your car? - My Dad's. Splendid work of art. - Thanks. - Can you get it nights? - [Margie] Harold? - [Harold] I guess so. Why? - You busy Friday? - [Harold] I'm not sure. Let me think about it. - Think about it? About what? Look, let's you and I live it up, my friend. There's a dance at the Y. I might even get us some genuine cognac. Pick me up at eight. - All right, I'll try. - I'll expect you. Bye now. Bye, lovely. See you on the Champs Elysee. (upbeat jazzy music) - Harold? Harold Krebs? - That's me. I'm Roselle. Roselle Simmons. - Charlie Simmons' sister, right? - My heavens. Have I changed all that much in two years? - Three years, actually. - Well, you don't seem to be having much fun at all. You haven't danced once. I've been spying on you. - I'm not up to the steps. All the chatter. - You need to be taught. Didn't your little sister, Marge, ever try? There are lots of new steps. I could teach you. It's my War Effort. Trade for a smoke? - It's a waste of time. I never could get my feet straight. - Silly. The feet are the easy part. It's the rest of your body, the way you hold your partner. The way you lead. I bet you like to command a girl. - Command a girl? Why? - Command me, Mr. Harold Krebs. Wait for the beat. One, two. One, two. (chuckling) Okay, go the other way now. Cross over your leg. Ready? Go. Front, back, front, hold, together. Did you ever dance like this with those foreign women? Front, back, front, hold, together. Don't. I've got to freshen up. I won't be long, all right? Wait for me here. Don't. - Hey, where are you going? Come on back here, Roselle. - You shouldn't have left. It would have gotten better. - You should have stayed. - I thought Roselle was really something. What would we do with girls like that in France? Christ, what do you want to do? Just mope around forever? I can't figure you. Whenever I want to forget about things, I just drink. Drink for a new one. - I want to remember. The good things. - Like being over there? Scared to death watching-- watching guys screaming and bleeding to death? - I wasn't scared. Not like you, Kenner. - Damn. Everybody was. You ever wake up in the sweats and shivers? I used to stuff my blanket in my mouth so I wouldn't-- I was scared. Everybody was. - That's a lie. - Everybody was. Only one thing worth remembering over there, those damn women. No names, no faces. Just those white bodies smelling like sweet apricots in those warm hotel rooms. - That isn't worth remembering. - All right. So, what is worth remembeing? - Being a good soldier, doing what you had to do. - Being a good soldier? You're crazy, Krebs, you really are. - You lie, Kenner. About everything. - Don't call me a liar. - It's not worth it. - Shut up. - Hey, you all right? - Crazy bastard. You stay away from me. I don't need a friend like you. - Hey, wait. Oh, go on. Go on, Kenner. (echoing) - Would you put the paper down, Harold? I'd like to speak to you. Your behavior was terrible last night. The whole neighborhood could hear you. - Sorry. - Why?. You have so much. Our love, you have a fine mind and a strong body. Have you decided what you're going to do yet, Harold? - No. - Don't you think it's about time? - I hadn't thought about it. - Well, God has something for everyone to do. There can be no idle hands in His Kingdom. Charlie Simmons is just your age. He has a job already and he's married. All the boys are settling down. They're all determined to get somewhere. Boys like Charlie Simmons are on their way to being a real credit to the community, all of them. Oh, Harold, please don't look like that. You know how much we love you. I just want to tell you this for your own good. Your father doesn't want to hamper your freedom. He thinks that you should be allowed to drive the car and if you wanna take some young girls out for a drive, that's fine with us. We want you to enjoy yourself, but you're going to have to begin to settle down to work, Harold. Your father doesn't mind what you start out at. All work's honorable, as he says. But, you're going to have to start at something. - Is that all? - Yeah. Don't you love your mother, dear boy? - No. I don't love anybody. (sobbing softly) I didn't mean it. I was just angry at something. I didn't mean that I didn't love you. Can't you believe me, Mother? Please? Please, Mother? - It's all right, Harold. (sobbing) I'm your Mother. I held you next to my heart when you were a tiny baby. - I know, Mommy. I'll try and be a good boy for you. - Harold? Harold? Would you kneel and pray with me now? Dear Heavenly Father, we thank thee for thy watch care and guidance over our son and your son, Harold. We thank thee especially for thy care of him on the foreign fields of battle and we are grateful to you for having brought him home to us safe and sound. Now, you pray, Harold. - I can't. - Harold, try. - I can't. - Do you want me to pray for you? - Yes. - [Mother] We pray now that you will continue to guide and direct him as he decides what use to make of his life. Please help him, dear Father, to find the right path as he learns to settle down. Please, dear Father, be with him. - [Voiceover] He had tried to keep his life from being complicated. He had felt sorry for his mother and she had made him lie. Still, none of it had touched him. He would go to Kansas City and get a job and she would feel all right about it. He wanted his life to go smoothly. It had just gotten going that way. Well, that was all over now, anyway. (slow sad orchestral music)
