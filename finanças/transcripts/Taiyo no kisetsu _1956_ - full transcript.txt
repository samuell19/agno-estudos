I skipped it. English just ain’t my cup of tea. Hey, Tat-chan! What's going on? I'm just killing time, but I also came to collect the money I won the other day. Look who's here. And I thought my day couldn't get any worse. Do you want to join us? You're strong in any kind of gambling, anyway. But there's still a tiny chance that you might lose. How is that actually? What class do you figure I'd be? Of what? - Of boxing, of course. - Oh yeah, sure. With a little training, I say you'd be a bantamweight. Maybe I should give boxing a try. But ain't you with basketball? Yes, but I'm not very good at it. Ain't my thing. Show the cards. - Three cards! - How lucky you are! - Come on, let's do it! - Yes! Hey, Eda-san! What is it? I’m burned out today. Haven't even had lunch yet. It's not about that. Hey! One two, one two! Can't you let me take part in a fight? Don't be crazy. You might get hurt. Hey! Jab, jab! This isn't basketball, where women also participate. One round wouldn't be a problem. I won't cause you any trouble. What's wrong? This guy wants to do some sparring. You're a fool to fight without practice. Hey, jab! Don't blame me if you get killed! It's all right. Basketball's made me pretty tough. I won't overdo it. Eda-san, if you let me box, I will let your debts go, including those today. - Let him have a go. - It'll be all right. Just let him spar with me or Izu, we'll go easy on him. Right Izu? Right. I don't know! A good thing the captain's not here today. Do what you want. It's none of my business! Hey, one two, one two! Hang in there, basket player! Go for it! Right hook! Right hook! What's wrong, basket?! Okay, we're finished! Sorry, that was a bit too hard. You put a good end to it without beeing killed. That last one was a rough one. But he did well, don't you think? - Yeah, his punches are pretty strong. - Is that so? Do you still want to leave basketball and join us, or have you had enough? Maybe you have, huh? Boxing is fun! Don't be a sour loser! Look at your face, big as a basketball! Boxing is fun! If you are that keen to get beaten, you can talk to the captain. If he starts now, he might make it to the national tournament. Yes, he has the talent for that! What's wrong? - Oh! - Look at him! Go, basket! Basket! Hey, brother. I still didn’t get the monthly rate for the camera I sold you. You're right. - How about today? - Sorry. Today's Saturday, so the banks closed after noon. Then, give me back the goods. - I already gave it away. - What? Since you started boxing two months ago, you got more agressive. - Seems like I have to pay, right? - Right on, that’s what I mean. Going to drink with your pals from the boxing-team again? On Saturdays you’re always going to town to turn hell loose. The check for the three glasses of whiskey. - Stingy! - What do you want? Apparently, a stylish bar opened in the neighborhood. - I'll take you there with my pals. - No, thanks! You’re going out already? Yep. What’s Dad doing there? He said he’s going to participate at an O.B. race tomorrow. What? Guess the "O" stands for oldie! What do you think? Your old man's still pretty fit. Just look at these muscles! I’m carved from a different wood than you folks. Hey, boxer, punch me right here! Come on, try to hit it. Tatsuya! That really was a hit! I didn't mean for you to take me so seriously. You told me to hit it. Tatsuya! Tatsuya! Leave it be, mama. Are you okay, father? All his friends are like that, they do what they like. - Then, what about you? - Well... You’re the same. You’re painting the world like you want it to be, don’t you? Your father is going to retire next year. - I meant Tatsuya’s behaviour... - I understand. - Mama, a glass of water. - Yes. Let me get you one! The big brother gets it. After all, he has a head start in terms of experience. What, altogether we only have 8.000 Yen? We can even have a good celebration with that. Shut your mouth! You only added 300 Yen. Even if it's only 300 Yen, I did my part to it. The professionals are not affordable. Why not have fun with amateurs tonight? It can’t be helped. In need, the devil eats flies. Even so, as long as we can hook some up. Hey, treasurer, get the bills out! Let's go for it! Who has the smallest bill? You, Tat-chan! Next is Nishimura. I suck at drawing! Come now, boys, go find us some girls! Don’t you come back with ugly hags. Wait a second. Those won't do, they won't do! They're bumpkins. That's the worst! They seem to be okay! But let's check the faces first. All three have the same noses. - Did they have plastic surgery? - You moron! The most important thing is that these girls dig us. Even if we fall into their snares, it's all the same. I've decided on them. If you guys let them go, it's no drinks for you tonight. - Gong! - Hey! - Dash! Dash! - You better succeed! Tat-chan, you got two numbers lower. - So, please you go ahead. - All right, but stay behind me. - Or else, I won't do it. - Okay! Oh, hello! Please excuse the disturbance. What is it? Well, we're members of the T-school sports... no, the boxing team and my name is Tsugawa. - Oh my, boxing? - Yeah... I'm all out of breath, I had a job catching up... What's wrong, Nishimura? Like I said, we are students from the T-school. We wanted to go out tonight, but we're at a loss since we had no girls to go out with. But, we decided to ask someone. We are looking for girls who desire for a little company. I definitely don't want to be pushy. So, if you have time today, may I ask you? There are five of us. It's very nice of you, but there are only three of us. Well, that’s fine. As a matter of fact, it's safer that way. Okay? Yahoo! You see, my mother's in the hairdresser's over there. We were going to meet her, so I'll ask her to take home the things we got shopping. It's a nuisance carrying them around. - Could you please wait a moment? - I guess. It's a lot of stuff for her to carry. No, that’s no problem. She’s coming by car. Well, that's fine, then. Be sure and come back. Don't worry. I'll tell you what, Sachiko can stay with you as a hostage. That's not needed, but we'd like to know the rest of your names too. Oh, right, I am Eiko. And they are Sachiko and Yuki. - Then, I’ll be waiting close by. - See you soon. Let's go, let's go! - They are gone, idiot! - Don’t worry! They'll be back! You nipped off very smartly, Nishimura! I'm sorry, I haven't got your nerve. What! As a punishment, you'll have to do as we tell you tonight. Let me tell you now, the one called Eiko is mine. Suddenly you’re the big shot! I clearly deserve her! If it weren't for me, you'd all run dry tonight. Got it! You’ll get the good girl. Oh, here they come! Damn, it's boring here. Hey, treasurer, let’s go to an interesting nightclub. Even if we go, things would be the same unless someone switches places. Then, it's Eda's turn who drew the lowest number after me. That's set, let's call them through the microphone. You idiot, don't do that! Seems you have forgotten why we came here. Hey! So, you didn't have any girl friends to ask out? That's not true. It just would've been too much of a pain to set a date with them. - That can happen, I guess. - Indeed. None of them was exceptional enough to be worth the effort. - Don't say that! - Sorry. But it is generally annoying when you fall in love with each other. You always have to watch the clock to get to appointments in time. Sooner or later, you get bound as if nothing else matters. "When we're not together, do you think of me"? You can't remember such things in detail, can you? You sure are funny! To the members of the boxing team of T-school, please gather immediately at the entrance. You're also not looking for a lover, right? I just can't fall in love with someone. It’s the same for me! I can’t imagine something like love at all. When someone talks about love, I tell them, “you'll never know women if you're looking for love". Oh my! But I have girl friends! We sometimes help each other find new ones. I'm kinda getting good at it. Well, how about me? I don't know, we'd have to go on a date and see. But you don't want to meet a guy like me a second time, do you? Oh! You really are straightforward! Most people try to make themselves look better when they meet someone for the first time. Maybe that's exactly what I'm trying to do. Maybe so. Hey, that doesn't look good. If there's not enough money, then Sawara's card will do the job. He said earlier that he started a tab here. Well, shall we get going, then? I don't really want to go home. - Right! - Let's not! Okay, let’s do it like that. Like a last chance, so to say. - All right! - Let's go! Why are there no hostesses coming by? Uh, seems to be a question about the budget! Hey, want to dance with us? What are you saying, you baby face?! Here's some money. Please keep it for the taxi fare. You are all broke, right? No, I said that I wouldn't cause any trouble. Don't worry. We've had a lovely time. All quite unexpected. See you! - All right, bye bye. - Bye bye! Welcome back home. - You're really late! - We had a little too much fun. Not just a little. Dad was talking to me. - What did he say? - That you should be careful. He never gets tired of saying the same old things. Chiyo! Yes, I locked everything. You answered again too fast. "I don't know, we'd have to go on a date and see". Hey, Izu, how did it go? Unfortunately it was just a boring win by decision. - You're strong! Strong! - It's your lucky day. Your opponent is the winner from last years tournament, isn’t he? Tat-chan has his luck with ladies, but not with guys. I never have luck with drawing lots. It's okay if the opponent is stronger. Even if you lose eight fights out of ten, you still have a chance. Right! Right! If you don’t try, you’ll never know! What is that? Hey, seems you have a secret adorer! Who did supply this? It says: “For Tsugawa-san, fight your best! Good idea to have your flowers sent beforehand. If your darling gets knocked out in the ring, you'll not smell the flowers. It’d be better to worry about your nose. But I have no clue who sent this. - Don’t play dumb now. - I mean it. You’ll know when you get out there. It's time! - Go! - Good luck! The bantamweight semi-final will be starting now. In the blue corner, Toho High School's Tatsuya Tsugawa. Tat-chan, stay strong! In the red corner, Keisei High School's... - What? - The flowers bouquet. Listen. Your opponent has a punch like a steam hammer. Try to make points from afar! You have the bigger range. Tsugawa-san! Hang in there! Tsugawa-san! - He fell down! - Hit him! Jab, jab! Tsugawa-san, be strong! Keep it up, do it! Keep it up, Tsugawa-san! Tsugawa-san, do it! Stay strong! I’m gonna pounce on him now, okay? Don’t be stupid. You’ll get knocked out and you’ll look ridiculous. It's okay, I'm not here to show off. I’ll do it my way! I can't hold back! You idiot! Fight! Tsugawa-san! Do your best! Break! - Tsugawa, hang in there! - Count! One... - Two, three... - Tsugawa-san! - Tsugawa, do your best! - Four... Five, six... Seven, eight, nine... Fight! One, two... Three, four, five... - Tsugawa, don't give up! - Six, seven... Eight, nine... Do your best! Since you came this far, do you wanna try your luck? Don’t leave him be. Or else you will go down. Don’t think too much about the crowd. Tsugawa-san, stand strong! Count! One, two... Three, four, five... Six, seven, eight... Fight! Fight! Matsuoka! Go for the body! Tsugawa-san! Tsugawa-san is the best! - How did it go? - Ah, I won. - On a TKO. - Congrats! Ophthalmology? Was the doctor in? - Yeah, he was. - I have to get my eye checked too. Your mother will worry. - Oh, it’s you. - The treatment really took long. I've got rid of them and waited for you. It got me pretty bad! The new doctor gave me two hours of absolute bed rest. It was worse than the fight. Maybe she wanted to flirt with me. How typical of you, men. Conceited to the bone. Hey, during today's match, I understood something clearly. - And that was? - That sympathy isn't allowed in a fight. - Really, huh? - It's true. Your opponent was smirking at us while he was going to his corner. You can't show tears to a guy like that. That's not a problem for me since I don't even know what tears are. Never been able to cry. I don't know that feeling at all. My father recently told me to punch him in the stomach. When I really hit it, because he was beaming so much, he fell over. And what happened, then? Nothing much. I have the feeling I couldn’t cry even if Dad died. You see, I don’t know why, but I experienced something similar. Who is that? Are you interested? He's the acquaintance of a friend. He seems to be performing here lately. Do you wanna know something about me? Whatever. I couldn’t cry one time! You hear me? Kinda. It was last year. I had a boyfriend that my parents approved also. We wanted to meet to go out for the first time in Yugawara, and so I waited. But he never showed up. On the way to our meeting, he was caught in a car accident and died. It was horrible. But, at that moment, I couldn't shed a single tear. Later on I cried though, but maybe it was only compassion. What do you think about this guy now? Nothing special. We just met recently. He seemed to have strong feelings for me, though. I'm not a person to fall in love that easy. I wonder why that is? So, you also can't fall in love. It looks like we're both in the same boat. Say, this Sunday I have stuff to do in Hayama. I am preparing the summer house. What do you say? Do you have time? I will know when the time comes. You really don’t like to make appointments. What an unsociable guy. The "Motel" name last year wasn’t really a hit. That's your fault! Well, you scored a few points anyway, brother, didn’t you? There was that Hawaiian girl that you hooked up with. Yeah, yeah, I was pretty crazy about that cutie! Nowadays, we get along damn well. Hey, I have a good idea for this year. I got it from French literature! - "Red and Black"? - It's nothing strict like that! "Bel Ami"! I'm picking "Bel Ami". Definitely "Bel Ami". "Bel Ami"? It sounds like "blimey". Well, whatever! Huh? Hey! With a car like that, even Nishimura can hook up with a girl. Girls who fall for a car are just not in the same class as those that fall for a yacht. - And there are no cops out in the sea. - That’s right. Huh? He already scored with some! I met Eiko-san and brought her along. That’s all. As I was dropping by at your place, your mother told me you would be here. I’m on my way home from Hayama. This is my brother. - Nice to meet you! - I'm Eiko. Oh, that’s a beautiful sailing boat. This year, I would love to sail with you. Be my guest. Every year, I take a woman with class. This year, the boat is called "Bel Ami". I was pondering about it. What a nice name! Last year, it was called "Motel", the year before "Dandy". Siblings always come along well. Hey, instead of trying to play mediator here, you should go home before the engine burns out again. What are you doing? Walking around naked like that! But I arrived like that. Did Eiko-san go home already? She will stay at her Hayama summer house. Is that so? I’m already preparing dinner. Please take her away before Dad comes home. Why is that? Because Dad might say something again. Let him talk! Everybody is entitled to their opinion. Eiko-san. Hey, show me how you hit the sandbag. Right now! Tatsuya, dinner is ready. Did you say something? No, dinner is ready. I don’t need any food. Well, then I ain’t eating anything, too. I'm telling them. Hey! What is it? I really can't do it. Huh? I really can't love. It ain't like that. Hi! - How’s it going with Eipin? - Who's Eipin? That's what I call Eiko-san since she's so lively all the time. There’s something serious going on. Ever since I brought her, she is picking you up every day. Everyone can see that you are addicted to her like she is with you. Hey! If you exert yourself somewhere else, it will show in training! Why are you laughing in a weird way? Nothing. You wouldn’t understand! - No clue! - Well then, just shut up! What? Huh?! What? She's showing up already? Sorry, senpai. Sadly, I have to go. "Thank you"! - Say! - Huh? I am, how shall I put it, not really feminine looking, aren’t I? It seems like... Whiskey, ah! Seems you turned melancholic due to tiredness, cause we already spent three days together. - That's not true! - It is! It's not! - It is! - It's not! - I said it is! - Absolutely not! - You better shut your mouth. - What are you saying? I am the problem, you see? My heart, you see? "My heart". I can’t really open my heart. - That's lame. - What is it? Don't talk all philosophical! Is that so? Yeah. I got involved with too many men. That much, that I can’t differ anymore. That’s why I can’t give up something within myself, even if I can flirt with men. I can’t love... It's despairing! Hey, us, you know... If we think about such things, we're over. Right, we're finished. Clean cut. Say, Tat-chan, shouldn’t we just split up? Right? Huh, whatever! I guess it's fine. Since we met each other in the city, it’s a good time to split up. How come women who really carry love inside them can turn out this way? I don't know how to answer that. I have no clue! - Welcome! - Welcome! - I heard you won the TK match. - Of course he did! What’s going on, Tat-chan? - Nothing is up. - Hey, Tatsuya! How’s it going with Eipin? There's nothing going on! Then, did I just see you glimpsing at Eipin or did my eyes deceive me? Guess I had too much to drink tonight! Come on, let's dance, right? - Let's dance. - Let's go, let's go! Give me a moment. Sorry for the sudden disturbance, but do you know me? - Am I supposed to? - Don’t try too hard! I don’t know you either. You wana take the piss out of me? I wonder! Better ask the guy behind you! You know why I hit you, don't you? Hey! - For stepping on your foot, right? - You bastard! If you knew, why did you play the fool before? You won't be able to play the trumpet like that anymore. That won’t prevent you from doing your great job. Wait, Tsugawa-san! Will you stop with that now? I’m only doing what I want. I got into a fight because I wanted to. That’s all there is to it. “That's all"! Get me what he's having. I am also only doing what I want. Oh, be my guest. Nobody will complain. Well, but why did you beat the bandleader? I know! Only because he was hanging out with me. Am I not right? Oh my, I was wondering where you are, Tatsuya. And here you are hanging around, drunk and talking nonsense. You bastard! Isn't that Tatsuya?! - Let's go help him! - Right on! Hey, they're giving us a good tune. Too bad we can't dance here. It’s definitely too narrow here. We'd need the deck of a cruiser at least. Ah! What are those? Are they noctilucas? They are just fish. Footballfish, I guess. - No way! - You'll find out if you get in. I'm going in for a swim. Due to the alcohol, I feel hot again. Here I go! Hey, you’re not coming? The water feels quite warm. Wait a minute. I'm coming. Tat-chan! Tat-chan! Tat-chan! Hey, I am right here! Did you think I was lost in the Pacific? Oh, what's that? It's only a jellyfish! Look into the water. There are lots of them out here. Say, let’s get back in the boat. I'm kinda scared. - You coward! - But, you see... Hey, you're crying. I'm happy, you know? I'm loving again, at last. - No reason to cry, then. - It’s not in a bad way. I am happy. I am no longer alone! I will no longer be alone! - Eiko! - Tat-chan! You in bed already? It’s only ten o’clock! You’ve been out in the sea late? With whom? I see! Hey, there's a party at the hotel tonight. Wanna go? Tonight’s the night! I’m wasted tonight, so I’ll go to sleep. Good luck, though. With the virgin-hunting, I guess. It’s not my problem if you regret it later. What now? He’s on the loose again? It seems to be Michihisa's turn now. It doesn't matter who it is. As one comes home, the other one leaves again. We did move to a place which is quite lively in the summer. That was your idea! You said you wanted to live close to the sea once in your life. You said that, father. You said the sea would be good for our children's health. They aren't children anymore! I suppose you're right. Tatsuya, there's a phone call from Hayama. Hello? Oh, Eiko-san. Huh? A music box? Oh, that? The receiver was on it. It's a kind of a hobby my mom has. She seems to have good memories from it... with Dad. Is that so? I love how it sounds. Say, it seems that last night really changed me. Would you like to come to my summer house? No one is around. No, it’s nothing important, but come now. I wanna meet you today somehow. Meeting me somehow? All right, I'm coming. What? Let you listen to the music box? Okay, got it. Hey, could you make way for us? - Aye, sir! - Aye, sir! Aye-aye, sir! Aye-aye, sir! - Where are you from? - T-school. We are from the Faculty of English at the Women's University. Astonishing! "What's your name"? Mary, Sally, Mitzi, Julie, Elsa! - There's your answer! - I wonder about your nationality. Japanese, of course. They're our given names. No wonder! But you all have educated names. Well, since we aren't that educated, we call ourselves Ishimatsu, Omasa, Komasa, Goemon, Onikichi, Chuji, and Kantaro! Hey, Tatsu, you're leaving already? What about Eipin? Don't be stupid! Hey, Eipin is coming! That bastard Tatsuya, acting like Eiko is his wife. Pull yourself together! I also said he shouldn’t annoy her that much. Tatsuya is quite unscrupulous. Say, wasn't Tatsuya with you guys? No idea! He didn't come to the harbor to sail with me. Really now? - I'll go look for him. - Sure, sure. Who was that? A regular customer! It's not your lucky day. Hey, hurry up! It’s pretty damn crowded, right? We already earned 30.000 Yen. We can drive to Aburatsubo with that. The English studies group will also join. They are cheaper than cabaret girls. What we do if we have to take the band along with us? - They'll go home on the last train! - We'll have no music, then. That's okay. We took a high entrance-fee. We can play the radio. We're screwed if there's an orchestra. You can’t dance to Beethoven. We'll use records, then! What about the local gang? They're already here. Should we give them 1%? Let them be, or we will be in trouble. Hey, come with us for a moment. Quite a show you're having here. You know why we're here, don't you? Huh, do you? You bastard! Acting all big! Take this, you asshole! - Wai... Wait a minute. - What do you want? I'm sorry, but this is all we have today. Let's see... - Why you bastards! - Damn it. I'm surprised you can keep up. Don't worry, it's not always going great in the beginning. Say, Tat-chan, tell me, do you hate me? You have changed. But, no, I don't hate you. Why did you go with that woman, then? Those are two completely different things. That wouldn't have happened if you danced with someone instead of staring at me like that. - It's boring just to look. - It's fine. I'm fine just like that, don't worry about me. Well, have a sit, then. Eiko-san! Eiko-san! - Hey, let's go! - Yeah, let's! Hoist it! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! - Give me your hand! - Hey, hurry up! Hey, everyone get on fast. - Sally, come in the boat. - Yes! - Okay, everyone's ready? - Come in! Get on! Tie that! - Hurry up, you two! - Come on, let's go. - Izu, we're leaving! - Yahoo! - Come on, let's sail! - Yeah! All right! Sho-Sho-Shojoji In Shojoji Temple's garden There's a moon-moon-moonlit night Everyone, out! Come, come, come! My friends are drumming on their belly Tap, tap, tap, tap tap! Keep going, keep going! Don't lose to the Priest Come, come, come! Come, come, come! Everyone, out! Come, come, come! Izu, I'm taking off. Okay, count on me! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Be careful! Come on! Isn't this lovely? It's lovely! What a nice place! Hey, Elsa! What will we do today? Is there a room to stay overnight? There's one! At the hotel! Really? In such a fishing-village? I've heard it’s a hotel used by foreigners on weekends. And by night, we can head out with the canoes. I don't know why, but I'm starting to get worried. I got invited by you, girls. - But that guy Kantaro hugged me. - You airhead. - You're only talking about it now. - I'm scared. Who’s Kantaro, by the way? Say, about that “regular customer”, who is she dating with? Give me a moment. - Hey, Tatsuya. - What? I'm going to take over Eiko. She doesn't love you any more. Oh yes, she does. You don't have to say that, just because she slept with you once. If I called now, she'd come trotting right back to me. Is that so? All right, you're on. Try to get her back tonight. I'll give you 5.000 Yen. If she refuses, you owe me 5.000 Yen. In either case, you can regard it as the cost of finishing with her. Afterwards I'll take over. It's time to go and play on the island. See you later! Hey, Tatsu, hurry up! Too bad we haven’t been together on the boat. But, while I was eating, I had the feeling you would approach me. I don’t like Michihisa-san. I hate him! I understand. I won’t let go of you. I definitely won't! I lost. I'll let you have the money when we get home. But there's one condition. - You can't make conditions now. - Well, this is more of a favor. Leave her here for the day, or otherwise I won't get anywhere at all with her. You like her that much, huh? Go to the mountains, and I'll pay for it. You have a training camp in Niigata anyway. Come on, hurry up. Eiko’s coming. All right! I'll sell her for 5.000 Yen. Okay, it’s a deal. She’s bought! I don't think he's coming back. When he was a kid, he didn’t calm down till he crushed all his most beloved toys. - There’s no difference today. - What do you mean? It's dangerous to be loved by him. But I'm not a toy! It's no good running after him! He's already lost interest in you! Besides, he’s a man who keeps his promises. What promise? What do you mean? Why don't you stay with me instead? I'm going back to Hayama in a day or so. Stop! They're all there! Crowds of them! We must be popular! Where are your girls, Nishimura? If no one’s here after you sent telegrams, will you put an ad on the papers? Don't be silly! That’s nonsense! Oh, be careful there! Ueno Station! Ueno Station! - Yo! - Welcome back! Nobody came for me. It’s less embarrassing than it’s annoying. Hey, Eipin is here! Ah, Elsa! Elsa! Goemon! Goemon-san! Tell me the news. - How is my brother doing? - No idea, I haven’t met him. But tell me, what was the promise you made to him? Since you mentioned that in the letter, I knew you'd bring that up once I came back. Why didn't Michihisa tell you himself? Guess he's got no guts. - Well, let me have a drink before that. - No, please tell me right now. Tat-chan, that just means you've sold me. Don't take it too seriously. I just... Here you have. All I said was that for the 5.000 Yen he gave me, I'd keep away from you. That's all there was to it. And did you think I'd agree? It has got nothing to do with you. It's my affair, not yours. What did you do with the money? I spent it all. That’s what I thought. Then, I shall pay the money back to Michihisa. And what if we make a new agreement? You'd only lose it. I don't care, I'll just go on paying till you stop. That's ridiculous! Are you going to do it again? Yeah. How come you're so mean? Say, if you really hated me, I don't think you'd do the things you do. I'll go on paying until things are right again. You're still young enough to be bought by money. But remember, Tat-chan, that I've really bought you, not the other way round. If that's all right with you, I'll do whatever you like. But... but, you see, now I understand. Will you tell me one thing? Do you still really love me? Looks like I do. In that case, why can't you love me in a more straight-forward manner? I couldn't myself once. But since that night on the boat, I've been honest and frank in my love for you. We've both been crippled. It might be the same for everyone else, but I'm sure that we can fix this. Well, I'll transfer the money. This is my decision. - Should we make another deal in return? - Sure! Right on. But it’s kinda nasty. In the end, that chick doesn’t dig me, at all. Damn, let’s make a deal! How will she react? - Hey, Tatsuya. - Huh? Last night I didn’t mention anything, because you came home late, but Eiko sent money again! Why don't you give up the whole idea? She's obviously crazy about you. Then, let's make an agreement with 2.000 Yen. - A price reduction? - Yup. 3.000 Yen will be for you. We will take 5.000 Yen from Eiko! I really don't like this, though. It's a dirty trick to break a girl's heart like this. Hey, Tatsuya, don’t you wanna stop this? With what? Eiko is still sending money! I should have refused from the start. It's unfair to do this without her knowledge. Huh? You saved 20.000 Yen already? It sums up to 20.000 Yen already. She is a tough opponent. As expected, it’s getting uncomfortable for you too. Better stop! The heart of a human can’t be measured with money! I only did it because you said so. I’ll take the money back. I’m not doing this because of the money. - You made a profit from it, right? - Here you go again! You're bad at losing! In the beginning, you thought Eiko wasn’t that bad. Oh, what a rare sight! I just went to your house, and your brother told me you're here in the harbor. I was also planing to meet you, I need to give you something back. Hey guys, how about we go ahead? - I see. - Well, see you later, Tat-chan! Later! - See you! - Thanks. You finish up here. It's really pouring. Hurry up, man! Oh! There’s a statue of a child over there. What? Ah, we took that off from an American's yacht. So you're putting away the memories yacht? Yeah, until next year. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just that... What? Can't you guess? I'm pregnant. I came here to tell you. Whose baby is it? Why yours, of course! I wonder if it isn't my brother's? It's impossible if you count back. It's three months along already. Wasn’t that bandleader also around? Don't be silly. Nothing happened with him. What shall we do about it? What do you mean? May I have the baby? I want to have a baby. Then, go ahead and have it. But don't think this will make our relationship any more formal. It's a pretty old trick to use a baby to hook a man. That's all right. I'll send my baby out to someone, but I'd still like to have it. Well, it's not a bad idea, having a baby around. Do you really mean that? Aren't you cold? Hey, brother! Are you sleeping? What do you want? Eiko is going to have my baby. Huh?! I'm so glad I gave her back to you. That would have been a problem for me. Did you get rid of it? You are heartless, brother. I'm going to be a father and a very good one. Moron, that ain’t funny! I don't want to be an uncle yet. You tortured her so much. What kind of child that’s gonna become? You took all your strength and time to do what you wanted. I give you my congratulations! What are you saying? You idiot! Oh well, last night at the station I met your brother by accident! And he said you're getting married. I'm never getting married. But I heard you're getting a kid. Well, we are living in fast times these days. Getting a kid before marriage is something normal, so it's okay. Who gives a crap? Hey, don’t get upset about things that are none of your business. Who's the mother? My brother gossips too much! But that’s a little strange. I bet you didn't have a kid just for fun. You have developed a strange taste. I once saw a photo of a champion hugging his child, and it was a turn-off. That looked pretty stupid for a pugilist who's supposed to be a demon in the ring. Hey, Tat-chan. Someone is looking for you, outside. - Who is it? - Is it Eipin again? What's up? I was in the middle of training. - But it's Eiko-san. - Why in such a place? Because it’s close to the hospital. Please see her. What’s going on? You were asking for me? Forgive me, but I really wanted to ask you something. It’s about our recent talk. I’m in the fourth month. I wanted to ask you one last time, loud and clearly. I told you already. That time, I asked you at the harbor, but your answer wasn’t clear enough. What do you want to do? You're also responsible for it. But it ain’t the right time to talk about that anymore. I'm in a bind. On the contrary. I didn't tell you definitely to have the child. It's entirely up to you. All I said was that it wouldn't be a bad thing to have a baby of our own. Is that how you think? For real? If that's the case, I can't give birth. Then, there’s nothing to do about it. It wasn't my intention to have a kid with you. Please, take me to the hospital immediately. Yes, yes. Sure, one moment please. Hello? Tsugawa-san? Sachiko speaking. Ah, Sachiko-san. Eiko-san is... Eiko-san died last night. Huh? What did you say? Eiko-san suddenly developed a post-operative peritonitis and she died. You liar! That can't be! It's the truth! The funeral will take place at one o’clock tomorrow. Tsch, she ruined it. He's back! It's your turn, Tat-chan! Anyone need a Two Bamboo? Wait a moment, wait, wait! Never mind, I don't need it. Damn it... For how many years have you been playing Mahjong again? Ron! I win! I win! You got a dora dora there. That's a big win. I wonder what's going on with Tatsuya today? Hey, wanna drink? We have a bar with free service. What shall I wear tomorrow? Might be best to pick the school uniform. Why would you? Eiko is dead. Eiko just kicked the bucket. God damn you! None of you understand! Aren't you cold? You stupid girl. Dying like that... Eiko, you damn fool! THE END
