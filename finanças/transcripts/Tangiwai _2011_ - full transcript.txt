Well, two wickets down already, so NZ really needs John Reid to dig in here. Come on, then, you bastard. CROWD GROANS Didn't feel a bloody thing. Adcock is getting extraordinary bounce out of this pitch. Urgh. He really is almost unplayable. CROWD GASPS (GRUNTS) Howzat! CROWD CHEERS This time he has him. He finally managed to get bat on ball, and he's caught behind by the wicketkeeper. And the NZers are falling like flies. MELANCHOLY MUSIC MUSIC CONTINUES Now Adcock, full of fire, charges in to bowl to the left-hander Sutcliffe. Great ball. Great ball. ♪ This is NZ's best batsman. Oh! CROWD GASPS Ooh, he's been hit! He tried to hook, and he's been hit on the side of the head. (GROANS) KNOCK AT DOOR Come in. Uh, excuse me, Mr Blair. Sorry for disturbing you. Nah, it's OK. Name's Bob. Yes. Bob. Would you like some lunch? No, thank you. But I will get you to call me a taxi. I'm going to head out for a bit. I'm sorry, Mr Bob. I'm under strict instructions. Would you like some lunch or a drink from the bar, maybe? No, thanks. I'm fine. Adcock charges in with real venom. It's short. Oh, he's been hit too! Miller has been struck in the chest, and another NZer has fallen to the ground. Piss off! Well, the crowd don't like this. The Kiwis are popular here, and they've just suffered a terrible tragedy back home. And now they're risking life and limb against this ferocious attack. DOORBELL RINGS ♪ DOOR OPENS ♪ DOOR SHUTS ♪ Bob's grandparents. (SIGHS) I know we haven't met, but Jim was worried about you. And... we just had to come. TAP RUNS WATER CONTINUES RUNNING Here, for goodness sakes. Let me do that. Bill. I'll turn the cricket on. They must be almost underway. No. No need. Bob's not playing, anyhow. All the same. News from Brittendon is that both Bert Sutcliffe and Lawrie Miller have been taken to hospital, and I don't think we'll see them again in this innings. < FAINT COMMENTARY FROM WIRELESS I didn't want her to marry your grandson. Bob told us. That's why she took off. That's why she took that train. That's why she— Oh, no, love. You can't take the blame for it. It was just a terrible accident. I should've let her marry him. Your beliefs are important to you, Mabel. I understand that. No. It wasn't that. I just didn't want to lose her. (BREATHES SHAKILY) I'd already lost one child, you see. Oh, love. Before Alec. I had to give up my son. (SOBS) I couldn't look after him on my own. And I swore then... I'd never let another child go. (SOBS) You loved her. She knew that. (BREATHES SHAKILY) I never said goodbye. (SOBS) Oh, Nessie, I never said goodbye. MELANCHOLY MUSIC E te tau ra, te mana, te tapu e. He honore, he kororia... ALL: ...he maungarongo ki te whenua. He whakaro pai ki nga tangata katoa. Amine.

Welcome back. How's life in the trenches? We're down to our last two. Tony's heading out. (SIGHS) What's going on? Suttie's down there. He's got a few stitches in his head. What — he's not gonna bat again, is he? I think he's preparing himself. (EXHALES) TENSE MUSIC CROWD ROARS OUTSIDE (EXHALES) Middle one. (GRUNTS) 'HINE E HINE' This is terribly courageous of Bert Sutcliffe — to return to the crease after such a blow. I think it's clear this is not just about cricket for the NZers. This is their response to the terrible tragedy in their homeland. 'HINE E HINE' CONTINUES CROWD CHEERS You beauty! MUSIC CONTINUES CROWD GASPS Watch out! Yes! THWACK! And the crowd love it! The NZers are not giving up. They're fighting to the very end. And after what they've been through, well, they've won this crowd over. Incredibly, Mooney and Sutcliffe are only 20 runs short of the follow-on target of 122. Can they do it? So Ironside runs in. Oh, he's out! Mooney's been clean-bowled! And with him goes one of NZ's last hopes. APPLAUSE Stay with him, Guy. He's doing something special. We should go, Bill. It's nearly over. We may as well stay for the last rites. Oh, Alec. I'm sorry. I didn't think. Oh, he's chipped it to cover, and this time, Murray takes the catch, and Guy Overton is out-bowled by Ironside. That's that, then. Aye. The NZ resistance is finally over — nine wickets down, one man short. Not enough runs on the ball. APPLAUSE REFLECTIVE MUSIC APPLAUSE CEASES I can't believe it. Can it be... Bob Blair? Surely not. It is. MUSIC BUILDS MUSIC CONTINUES MUTTERS: You bloody beauty! MUSIC QUIETENS (BREATHES SHAKILY) What the hell are you doing here? I thought I could help. But I can't see a bloody thing. Just throw the bat at it, Bob. Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. (SNIFFS) (EXHALES) Blair faces. CROWD: Oh! That is the end of the over, which will be a great relief to the valiant Bob Blair. Come on, Suttie! Here comes Tayfield. And he bowls. Sutcliffe has smashed this one. Oh, that's a massive six! Into the stands... over long on. And with that defiant blow, Sutcliffe takes NZ past the follow-on target, thanks to the presence of that lonely and terribly courageous figure at the other end of the wicket, Bob Blair. And in comes Tayfield again, and Sutcliffe has gone after him, and it's another towering shot. Over mid-wicket this time for another six runs. Help me, Alec. And Tayfield can only look on in bewilderment. PEACEFUL PIANO MUSIC MUSIC CONTINUES And Sutcliffe takes a single, looking to keep strike for the next over, which means Blair will face Tayfield. That's 19 runs off the over. One to come. Blair faces Tayfield. All eyes on the young man Blair. (EXHALES, SNIFFS) NERISSA: 'Hit a six for me.' (SIGHS) CROWD ROARS CHEERING BUILDS Yes! There are no words to describe this moment. Just listen to that crowd.
