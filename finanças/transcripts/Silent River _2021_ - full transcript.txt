Patrick was a scientist. He created P2. This is P2. [Elliot] What happened to him? [Greta] He died. Patrick developed P2 for years. First, privately then needed more funding so he got Tantalum involved. When he got to prototype stage, they took control and ownership of the project and pushed him out. So he's a robot. [Greta] He's not fully functioning yet. He was offline and inoperative when I found him, that's why I'm staying here for now. Reactivation is a process. [Elliot] When do you plan to reactivate him? [Greta] Underway now. He's in startup and calibration. It takes time. When he is fully functional it will be easier to travel. [Elliot] Where are you going? I don't wanna get you involved. [Elliot chuckles] I think it's a little late for that. I helped Patrick when he was alive. He shared everything with me. There were administrative privileges that no one else knew about except for me. So now the company is looking for me. They want P2 back for sure. [laughs] You're hiding out. Wow! So Patrick designed P2 to look like him? A somewhat younger version, yes. -Module completed. -Oh! Shit. Oh. How are you feeling? [Elliott panting] I feel good. Thank you for asking.

I told his boss and before you knew it, he was cut from the company. His health fell apart and he didn't care about anything anymore. He died unexpectedly of a heart attack, but I know what really killed him. Patrick once told me, while developing P2's memory conveyance, he believed he could capture an image of his soul and store it into P2. It's the true breakthrough of the invention that Tantalum knows nothing about. And what was that phone call about? They wanna meet me. Who's they? Amanda. She's in charge of the recovery.
