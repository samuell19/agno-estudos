AN ADC FANSUB FOR NON-PROFIT USE ONLY You said you felt something. Where? How did it feel? What did your body feel? You're doing it for two hours now, but you feel as always. When the girl who had just turned seventeen said farewell to this world, there was no sign of sentiment or dream in her ugly face nor in the bottom of her heart. People will perhaps not believe in the unmoveable truth I've experimented with. 17 year old girl. Suicide by taking poison. It's totally different from yesterday. But what exactly is different? Tell me! Wait your turn. I suppose it's no good this way. You feel it after all? But we knew from the beginning that sex was useless! But it must not necessarily be. Shit! Only because you slept with an adult who knows more about sex than we do. What do you feel with your body? I don't know. But haven't we decided not to feel sex with our body? Yes. Why then did you have sex with goddam teacher? Weren't you embarassed of your body? You prostituted yourself! Shit! Don't be so rough! I'm not rough! No! Don't hurt her Koichi! There's a baby in Yasuko's belly. Do you want to kill our baby? Sex is no big deal. I make sex with all of you and bear the child. If we raise the child properly, it may mean we can beat sex. You mean we can no longer trust heart and body? Yesterday I thought it's no good the way it is. Adults have sex in order to get children and then they raise them. That's the normal way, isn't it? But when I am doing it with my mind, why should that be the sex of the flesh? Because we do it with mind and body. A 16 year old feels with her skin. Are you kidding? I'm 15! If we become mums and dads at 15 our whole sex could be overturned. Throughout Japan. But I won't turn over. I'll just become a mother. So when you felt with your body, did the world turn over? Not at all. That's the problem! No sex with pleasure! Didn't we promise that? No question, that's a betrayal. Right? A betrayal of what? Us! I had no intention to betray you. It's just... Just what? What is it? I was scared and anxious and afraid to tell you. Because it's too much for you. She's gone mad because she's already a fully fledged adult. You're hiding something! I'm hiding nothing. Hiding means betrayal! But I'm not hiding anything. I, for one, have no idea what's going on. Yes, but it's clear that Yasuko has prostituted herself. Let's straighten it out once more. That's what I want too. Shit! Let's make an on-the-site inspection. An on-the-site inspection? Yes. Gushing Prayer: A 15 Year Old Prostitute Directed by ADACHI MASAO I asked him to come for a personal consultation. I said that I'll wait here. He showed up on time. He came half running, right? Yes. I said straight into his face: In fact I'm four months pregnant. But since I was promiscuous, I don't know who the father is. He just nodded and meant that this is a prevalent aspect of our time. Then we started to walk. I wanted to do it like the couples around us and linked arms with him. Like this. Then I said that I'm going to have an abortion and wanted him to come. Nonsense! We've decided to give birth to the child! I just said that to delude him. As expected he nodded and said alright. One can not definitively say that a decisive moment for one person is exclusively decisive if another person intervenes. That's what he said while his eyes where sparkling. I said that I was in love with him all along and got ready to kiss him. Teacher, I love you! You have the money for the abortion? Well then. When you say you're in love with me you're trying to evade sex, your age and your whole life, right? Yes. But since it would result in a strange relationship if you just accompany me to the abortion I want to make a deal. A deal? You mean with society and the whole world? No. A deal only with you, teacher. I want you to sleep with me before you accompany me to the abortion. That way it is give and take. Do I gain something economically if I sleep with you? But I love you. A prostitute. That's what you are now. Yes. So you suggest to establish an unconditional relation? I understand. Alright. At that point my body and my heart had totally forgotten that he was my teacher I was just thinking about the way he was getting down to business. So it's fine to do exactly the same thing? Let's do it. Yes, do it. He didn't bother with formalities... So, he got down to business right away? Yes. He lifted my skirt. He didn't act sad or so. He was just a lecherous middle-aged man. I felt I was doing exactly the same thing as all adults. Come to the interesting part? That's it. Teacher! No! I'm not your teacher! You are a prostitute. I'm your client! I'm buying your sex, I'm not buying your youth! Can a prostitute live eternal youth? For me this is a new experience. Bataille says that the labor of prostitutes regulates us all but that it cannot negate the eroticism of youth. The discovery of a historical truth is now in progress. What does that mean? What did your body feel? To associate with adults, your body makes you a prostitute. That's against the rule! So the stupid lie of goddam teacher turned you on? No! You simply got excited because you're pregnant, right? No! I'm a pregnant prostitute. That's why I felt something. Like now. So you're saying I'm your client? Yes. Our rule stipulates to not hide anything from each other, and to not sell anything. I get the feeling that I'm now selling myself to Koichi. What did you sell? Can you sell that to me as well? Yes. But I'm not sure of what I'm selling. You're afraid of bearing the child and of having an abortion. You just got turned on because you thought that sleeping with goddam teacher means happiness. You've turned Koichi into an adult like goddam teacher. What opportunism! You pig! It's fine with me to be a pig. But I was the only one who felt it. And I'm the only one who's pregnant. I'm going to die. Goodbye. 18 year old girl. Suicide by taking poison. Morning sickness? Hello little baby... Hana ichimonme. A balloon that can't fly won't fly... Yasuko! Yes! Where are you, Yasuko? I'm here. Your friends are here. I'm coming. Hana ichimonme. A balloon that can't burst won't burst... When the girl who had just turned seventeen said farewell to this world, there was no sign of sentiment or dream in her ugly face nor in the bottom of her heart. People will perhaps not believe in the unmoveable truth I've experimented with. The fortuneteller said that there is no need to hurry with marriage. One must be grateful to live for 10 years. He also said that long life doesn't necessarily mean happiness. But a short life is fine. It's fine to be not happy. It's fine to carry a heavy burden. If only one can live a human life. Not to wait until life is worn down, but to burn it until there is nothing left. Suicide by jumping in front of a train. 20 years old. Watch closely. They're adults, but they're feeling sufficiently with their bodies. The woman is my mother. She's not a prostitute! Watch closely. Is what you felt with your body the same thing my mother is feeling? It was the first time we held hands. If only I could bring back this sweet evening in June. Please drink the Suntory Red that I've brought along. 300 Brovarin sleeping pills. Suicide by taking poison. Where and how is it different? Oh, when did you come home? Yasuko, tell me! It's perhaps the same after all. Your mother is also selling something with her heart. She's a prostitute. Okay, it's decided! What? We'll have to do real prostitution. You take real clients and do it for money. Me? Yes. And if you say your body feels something, I'll also become a prostitute. Why? Just because! If you and his mother feel the same thing, then sex is not worth worrying for us. You said you'll beat sex, but that's just to try to appear smart. Prostitution? We have to straighten that out. It's not punishment for my betraying you by sleeping with teacher? Of course not. And it's not just a trial? We can't afford such a thing! If we go on like this, it's just a question whether we feel sex with our body or not. I only want to make clear whether we can beat sex or not. In that case, I'll do it. -Okay. -Okay. Welcome. I'm going out. You always take care of my son. Shut up! I don't need pocket money. The very first time I felt free in my whole life was when I realized that I too, have sexuality. Make up your mind! Okay. I'll do it right away. Isn't 500 Yen too expensive for this, eh? I don't know. The first time I really wanted to have sex was when during clean-up after class, my pussy touched the corner of the table That shocked me. I felt a womanly sensation. When I touched it with my hand I again felt the sensation. You must have felt something? I don't know yet. You're not a professional prostitute yet. Why not? A professional gives proper service. Okay, let's do it the professional way. He'll buy you for 300 Yen. For only 300 Yen? The money doesn't matter? We're not setting a price, anyway. You pay me the 300 Yen. The first time I had sex was in spring when I turned 14. I don't remember anything. No, that's a lie. I remember everything. I don't feel a thing. It's no different at all from the last time. Then it's a lie that you felt something with the goddam teacher. Why don't I feel anything? Feel it with your body! It's meaningless after all. I've got tired from standing. I never liked eating very much. But sex is very much like eating. When your stomach is empty, everything you eat tastes good. I love the feeling of an empty stomach and holding back when I need to take a shit. I love the feeling of a full stomach after eating. I love the peaceful feeling after having eaten and taken a shit. I hate that. You're too precocious Does anyone want to eat mine? Eat it yourself. After all, you're earning it. I don't want to eat. I somehow get the feeling that it's not real prostitution if you take only 300 or 500 Yen. You're right. Should we set the price? No. Usually the market price gradually drops once the base price has been set. Already, you are the perfect pimp. It's time for you, too, to start with prostitution. Right now. I think Yasuko is really getting turned on. I'm the opposite. Shall we draw a conclusion? I'm not done yet. My body doesn't feel the sex at all. I intend to sleep with every single one of you today. I... only my body is now able to prostitute itself. But I don't feel anything. Nothing. I've got tired. For one, the number is too high. On average, it's 10 guys per day. That makes 70 per week. Let's take a break for a while. I don't want to stop midway. That's cheating. We don't yet understand a thing. Everything is over now. Nothing is left but progress. When did I have sex the first time with Koichi? Why did everyone think I should bear the child? Why did only I get pregnant? Why? Why is the baby in my belly everyone's baby? I still don't understand a thing. You didn't feel anything at all with your body? You're just tired? Does that mean we won against sex? Not us! It's only Yasuko who prostitutes herself. No, I felt as if I were prostituting myself along with her. With your own body? Well... I, and you, and you, we did nothing! I did nothing either. Yasuko! We cannot beat sex, can we? Sex without our body is useless, isn't it? Prostitution, too, is useless. So we are finished. I don't know whether we're finished, but I get the feeling we lost against sex. My body knows that. With her like this, you be the prostitute! That's what I was thinking, too. Start right away. You be the client. We're finished, anyway. Let's have a party. You're right. Do it with me! Okay. I'm not pregnant, but I've had an abortion, twice in the past. Do you want to become pregnant? I've felt with my body a couple of times as well. It's my first time with a professional. Every woman is born a professional. A professional feels like a professional. Do it for real to see whether she feels it or not. Yes, I'll do it for real. Do it! Come on! Do it for real! Come on, do it! For real. Come on! Do it! Hana ichimonme... Cry and laugh. Nimonme... Hana ichimonme. Losing, losing, sanmonme. I can feel something. Right now. I feel it. I do feel it! Do you really feel something? Now, right now! I feel it! Stop joking! It's no lie. I feel something. You're lying! I have to think for a while, alone. It occurs to me... that it's not because I've become a mother that I felt the sex. Can you think all alone? There is no other way than that. Wait! I said wait! It's the money you earned. Take it! Thanks. Shit! Hey, Yasuko has left. Is she off to die? She's off to get rid of the child. I'll go and see. Those were happy days. It is mean of me to choose this way, but it can't be helped. 18 year old girl. Forced double suicide by gas-poisoning. Mother. Mama. I don't know. I'm a 15 year old mother. I am a 15 year old mother. A woman is like the moon made only for the night. Suicide by jumping in front of a train. I've fooled you perfectly. Did you really believe I slept with that goddam teacher. You've been tricked so easily. It's painful. I didn't know it would be so painful. Mother! Let's marry. If you have to suffer like an adult and abort the child we can marry as well. Didn't you say to leave it all alone. I can't leave you alone. We couldn't beat sex. The body felt nothing and the soul wasn't rescued. Therefore let's marry! But I still have a chance. I can become a mother. Yasuko! Stop it. Now that you know you can't win, you want to accept being a loser? You taught me everything about sex, right? If I've been cheating it's because you're more mature and cheating even more. It is foolish to be tricked by my lie. Sex is a problem one has to think about alone. If you've got time to feel sorry for me and follow me around, think about yourself! So we are not friends any more? Our rule has been broken now. Because you've cheated. You're lying. It was a rule that practically didn't exist in the first place. Where are you going? I don't know. Perhaps to hell. You're going to continue with prostitution? Well, maybe. Goodbye. I'll attend classes again from tomorrow on. Bye-bye. I should also return home. My period is coming and I feel depressed. Go! Return home! Goodbye. And your companion? He'll come later. Perhaps... Perhaps? Anyway, here's the money. Thank you. There definitely is a time to part. Tonight I've shelved another friend. When morning comes, my friends, you will have forgotten my name and have left. Suicide by jumping into the sea. 19 years old. I wonder if my breasts have milk already? Hello, are you miss Aoyagi? Yes. There is a call from outside. Yasuko it's me, Koichi. What are you doing there? Yasuko! Yasuko! Yasuko! I want to be alone. Damn. It's foolish to become an ordinary mother. More, more! To enjoy life to the fullest! To feel! To feel every sensation! Mother! Before my body stiffens your poem collection will have dropped to the floor and become ruined by the rain. That serves you right. It's you alone I don't want to lose to. Sleep yourselves, the ones who survive. I cannot get to sleep yet. Suicide by taking 150 Brovarin pills and hanging himself. Hana ichimonme. Go to hell all of you. Hana ichimonme. This is not a joke, I'm serious! Shit! I'm obsessed with her. Hana ichimonme. Go to hell all of you. Hana ichimonme. This is not a joke, I'm serious! To have an abortion means defeat. We couldn't beat sex, so what was all this for? What should we do, if we can't win? To do nothing means defeat. Having a child... Becoming a mother... No! I'm scared. I can't! Father, Mother, Grandpa, Grandma, Brother, Sister, It is time to separate. I'm not suffering at all, but it hurts when I think I will kill myself after having conveyed all my suffering over to you. But there is no other way. Goodbye. 17 year old girl. Suicide by taking poison. Yes, I don't want to be defeated. But if I can't win there's no other way but to die. I'll die. Hana ichimonme, 8 plus 7 equals 15. Hana ichimonme, I am also 15. Aoyagi Yasuko. A 15 year old... mother. With 15 years she dies. Because I don't want to be defeated, I will die. Aoyagi Yasuko! Are you still alive? Good, you're still alive. If you want to die, die in a more gentle, girlish and beautiful way. Am I not beautiful now? You are beautiful enough. But those who have died before you were more... much more beautiful. Idiot! When the girl who had turned seventeen said farewell to the world, there was no sign of sentiment or dream in her ugly face nor in the bottom of her heart. People will perhaps not believe in the unmoveable truth that I've experimented with. I don't want to die yet. Teacher! Let's die together! I could die without you, but let's commit double suicide. Double suicide? I've loved you for quite a while. And all this happened because I told my friends that I slept with you. My friends have all died. What are you saying? I'm your homeroom teacher. I'm in charge of 50 pupils. If I fell in love with every one of them, I wouldn't last long. I just came here because Koichi called and said that you were going to die. Don't get me wrong. Stupid teacher! Stupid Koichi! You don't care about me in the least. Right. Anyhow, let's get the gas out. Koichi, you idiot! Why are you here? I'm afraid of misunderstandings. I'm leaving. Teacher, are you running away? It seems you were pulling my leg. I'm off. Wait, goddam teacher! She asked you to go with her to the abortion. She'll give birth to the baby. She'll give birth to the baby. She'll give birth to the baby! She'll give birth to the baby! She and you have made up several lies to get me into trouble. But I won't allow any more of this. Do you admit that you love her? I will marry her anyway. In order to beat sex, we will marry and have the baby. We will become a 15 year old father and mother. What foolish talk! Stop this nonsense! I failed because I couldn't beat sex, and couldn't give birth to the child. Do not conduct an autopsy. Nobody will ever understand my inner side. The End.
