(dramatic orchestral music) (machine beeping) (alarm blaring) (ominous pulsating music) - Kitty, stop this. Come inside. Kitty, please. - Kitty! Kitty. - [Nurse Stevens] Kitty, please. (Kitty screams) (men chattering) (knuckles knocking on door) - [Man] You came about the ad, huh? Fine. You can undress in there. - What? - What do you mean, "What?" You saw the ad didn't ya? Art photography models. Cash paid immediately. Now, I got a guy waitin' inside and a girl that didn't show up. It's 150 bucks. You want it or not? 150 bucks, honey, cash. (ominous rattling music) - Okay. What do I do? - Take your clothes off. Nice. Very nice. Jack! - Yo! - Get in here, let's go. (suspenseful electronic music) Well, what are you waitin' for? Get out of the rest of those schmattas! - Hey, this is more like it. Young skin. - [Officer In Trenchcoat] Okay, everybody hold it. This is a bust. - [Officer In Navy Jacket] Come on, buddy, let's see if we can find you some clothes. How ya doing, Roland? - I hope your rap sheet isn't too long, sweetheart, 'cause this is the big one. You ever heard of conspiracy to commit oral copulation? Get that shirt on, baby. I gotta talk to you. Jesus, how old are you? - [Paco] Marina, it's just going to take a few minutes. Come on. - [Marina] All right. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, can the greaser shit. You're doin' business with me. - I talk to Carlos, nobody else. - You talk to me or you walk with nothin', senor macho man. - Okay, okay. What do you got? - What do you got? (knuckles knocking on door) - Hold this. Let me see what's going on. (suspenseful rock music) - Hold it, bitch, you're not going anywhere. - [Drug Dealer] Ah, shit! - [Officer] Hold it! - Oh God. - Ow! - [Officer] Don't move. Come on. - How old are you? - Exactly, Mr. Beach. As you know, it's an experimental program. The girls we have here would be eaten alive if they were thrown into a prison, but the crimes they have committed make it impossible to even consider placing them in halfway houses. Some of them are extremely dangerous. Yes. (suspenseful electronic music) They require constant observation and supervision. Yes. Yes, the age range of the girls starts at 15, and some of them are in their early 20s. Yes. I would be more than happy to see you this afternoon. - We'll try and make this as painless as possible. All girls admitted to the dormitory submit to a body search. - [Nurse Stevens] All right, girls. Lean over. - This floor is devoted to medical checks for all our girls. Sick bay, medical research. - Research? - The state has allowed us to do a certain amount of experimentation with behavior modification. We are interested in trying to find the causes that have led them to antisocial acts. We also have a basement full of records dating back 40 years to show the lack of progress until we started. - She looks harmless. - Only a social worker would think like that. She's in on manslaughter charges. - Lori? You're next. (ominous music) - This is where we say goodbye. I have a lot to do and I think what you have seen will be able to answer any of the state's questions. I'm sure our funding will continue with no major problems, don't you? - I hope so, Miss Madison. It's been an education. - Can you find your way out? - I'll manage. - Thank you. (ominous music) (girls chattering) (soft electronic music) - Come on in, honey, the water's fine. - [Inmate] A man! - Get in here, baby. - [Inmate] Don't you need a shower? - [Inmate] Aww, and he's cute. - Hey, baby, don't go nowhere. Let's get him, girls. - Yeah! - Woo! - Seen enough? (synthesizer music) (inmates chattering) - No way. - Stop. (girls chattering) - [Inmate] Get away! - Come on. - Yo! (inmates chattering) - [Inmate] Really? (girls chattering) - [Inmate] He's a sweetheart. (inmates chattering) - Yo, Mama! Mama! Mama. - [Mama] What's the matter, darling? - I'll give ya a cigarette for one of those candy bars over there. - [Mama] No thanks. - Come on. (inmates chattering) Why don't you add 'em up right here. Fuck! (inmates shouting) (inmates chattering) - [Inmate] I don't need this shit, man. - Shit. Come on! - You don't have to throw 'em like a fuckin' asshole! - You don't have to throw shit around. (inmates chattering) - [Inmate] You're askin' for it. (inmates chattering) - [Inmate] Something good, yo. (inmates chattering) - Somebody say he? (inmates chattering) - Look at that. - [Inmate] I know. (laughs) - Fresh fish? - You want me to see what they're about? - Yeah, you do that. (inmates chattering) - What the hell are you doin'? - Look, you keep away from us. - Take it easy, Barb. I was just thinkin' when you and your little sister there are both in for hookin', baby slut oughta be straight enough to handle her own meat. Know what I mean? - How ya doin', Barb? Hi, Jen. What's happenin'? Everything okay with you two? - Hi, Valeska. (Valeska grunts) (synthesizer rock music) - Look at that, the tramp of the dormitory's back again. - Hey, Deke, don't ya have anything better to do than run your mouth off about me? - Yeah, you're lookin' to get jammed, Dottie. - Don't make me get up. If I do I'll be twistin' some tits. - Deke, don't start anything. (inmates chattering) - [Dottie] What are you lookin' at? (inmates chattering) - Why is everybody so mean? - [Deke] Lenka, you're losin' it. (inmates chattering) - Who are you? - Nobody. - Nobody. We'll see. You have pretty eyes. (ominous music) (inmates chattering) (inmate gagging) - What's the matter, honey? You look like you need somethin' to make ya feel good. - I think I'm gonna get sick. - Take it easy. I didn't get nothin' to eat yet. Listen, I got some serious... (inmate grunts) Man, there's some weird shit goin' down around here. I hope there ain't nothin' queer in this food. - How'd the strip go, babe? - What you mean? - Don't give me that bull. You holdin'? - Girl, I don't know you and I want you outta my face. - Hey, I'm on your side. You don't got, I can get. - Oh yeah? What are you, Madison's suck up? - Okay. You need somethin', you know where to come. Just remember, that's all. There's so much shit jammed in here during visiting hours you wouldn't believe it. I know where all the bodies are buried. Ya get me? I got connections. (chuckles) You wanna get laid? You wanna get high? You come to me. You come to Valeska. (chuckles) - Okay, everybody, listen up. Mail call! Askew? Askew! - Thanks. - Elmore. Gattos. Allen. - [Rebel] It's from your ma, right? - [Officer] Avila. - [Rebel] What'd she say? - Cleaver. - Shut your hole, Rebel. - Come on, Lisa. - Boyd. - [Rebel] She got somethin' for us? - Yeah, she's got somethin'. - [Officer] Boyd? - Only we gotta wait 'til we get outta here to get in on it. - [Officer] Morales. - Oh shit. - Jones. - It's tighter now than it's ever been. How we gonna pull a split? - Serges. Pierce. - You leave that up to me. - [Officer] Hendrix. Shank. - Hey, I hear you're in for the same thing as us. - No, I... - Look, don't get upset. We were in town and on the streets for exactly one day when we got busted. I hadn't even turned a trick. And would ya believe it? Jen is still a virgin. - What the? - Sorry, honey, I didn't see your little spic body stickin' out in my way. (Rebel screams) (rock music) (inmates shouting) (Rebel and Marina grunting) (inmates shouting) (punches thudding) (Marina and Rebel grunting) (inmates shouting) (Marina panting) - So, you can take of yourself. Just don't keep having to prove it. (Jen screams) (ominous music) - Zip it or shove a sock in her! - Shut up, ya stupid fruitcake! - I'm gonna kill that dumb bitch! (Jen screams) (somber electronic music) - Cool it, honey. It ain't gonna get any better. This is the way it's gonna be. - Shut up! I'm tryin' to sleep! (inmates chattering) - I'm here to help you, Paige, and I want you to understand that. - Sure. - Paige, I've asked your father to come and see you. - I don't have to see him. You can't make me. (ominous rattling music) - Paige, do you know how lucky you are even to have a father? You know Barb and Jen, those two girls waiting outside? They have no one to depend on but each other. You've seen what it's done to them. They are sick. They've become ill. They think they have no one else to rely on. They live in a dream world. - I know what you're doing. You can't make me think I'm like them. - Paige, I am not. - You think you're going to make me trust you because you tell me someone else's secrets. Well, you can forget it. - I'm sorry you feel that way. Perhaps some medication will help. I am making an appointment for you to see Dr. DeMarco this afternoon. Let's see what he can do for you. - I won't see my father. I won't. - We will talk about that later, Paige. Now you will have to excuse me. I have other girls to see. (inmates chattering) (ominous music) (Gloria groaning) - They comin' regular yet? - What? - Don't jive me, Gloria. You're pregnant. Those floppy shirts ain't been hidin' it so good lately. - (chuckles) Oh God. Please, don't tell anyone. They'll put me in a prison hospital. - What are you gonna do, have it in the mess hall? - I don't know, but please. Don't tell anyone, please. - It's your funeral, baby. I just hope it ain't the kid's. (ominous music) (knuckles knocking on door) - Come in. Madison tells me you're not in the mood to cooperate. - There's nothing to cooperate about. - Hm? You look like a reasonable girl to me. What seems to be the problem? - There is no problem. - Then why are you here? - In your office? - You know what I mean. - Isn't it obvious? You've got my file. I'm a whore. - Seems to me like you're a little rough on yourself. - Yeah. (ominous rattling music) I'm black and blue all over. - I'd like to work with you without using medication. How do you feel about that? (lilting electronic music) Let's talk about your health. How are you feeling today? - You wanna find out? - Yes, of course. - Then open me up. (sultry electronic music) (lock clicks) (Jen screams) - It's okay, it's okay. Shh. (soft synthesizer music) Shh, it's all right, it's all right. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. (metal tools clattering) (Gloria grunting) (water pattering) - Gonna be okay, Gloria? - Yeah. Yeah, just don't go too far away for a while, okay? - Sure. Come on. - Um, I don't think we should be doin' this. - Don't talk, just get it out. (upbeat electronic music) - Rebel, I don't feel too good. (grunts) Rebel, I need you. Rebel! - Gimme a second! - Rebel, I need you. - [Rebel] Just a minute. - Rebel! - Just a minute! - [Gloria] Rebel! - Just a minute! - Rebel. - [Rebel] I'm coming. - [Miss Madison] Attention, girls. - Visiting hours will be held this afternoon in the mess hall. - Hey, Dottie, I'm really sorry. - You motherfuckin' scumbag. - Hey man, I don't need this shit. (inmates and visitors chattering) - It's so good to see you. I miss you. I love you. - Paco, you gotta get me outta here. - Marina, it's not that easy. You gotta understand, you're in on some real serious charges. - And whose fault is that? (speaking in foreign language) - I couldn't help it. (speaking in foreign language) - Trust you? I did trust you and now I'm gonna be here until, I don't even know until when. - I got somebody workin' on it. It's just going to take some time. - And what do I do in the meantime? You know they got girls in here that wanna rip my face off? - Take it easy. I got something for you. - What? (inmates and visitors chattering) - Take it. - [Marina] What? - Take it. - Are you crazy? - Will you just take it? - What am I supposed to do with this? - Just keep it. You're gonna need it. - Paco, if I get caught with this. - You won't get caught. Just hide it someplace safe. - There's no place safe in here, Paco, you know that. (inmates chattering) - Okay, five minutes 'til lights out. - Go fuck yourself. - Screw you. - Drop dead. (sultry electronic music) - No. - Yes. - Don't make me. - Why not? You want it. - No. - You want it, don't you? - Please. - Say it. - No. - Say it. - Yes, I want it. Give it to me. (soft twinkling music) (Billy mimicking gun firing) (gun clicking) (Billy grunts) - Okay. - You never know when this might come in handy. - Billy, put it away. It scares me. - Sure. Sure, we got better things to do, don't we? - [Lori] Billy. - What? Come on, Lori. You and me both know why we parked out here. This ain't no time to play hard to get. - I'm not, I just want you to be gentle. - You want me to go easy? Hey, I'll go easy. How's this? Okay? How's this? And this? (crickets chirping) (inhales) That was great, baby. You're so sweet. - Billy, I don't think we should do this anymore. - What? Don't talk like that, honey. I was just gonna ask you to do me a favor. - What? - You're so good, I thought you could help me out. I got a couple of friends who wanna meet you. - What? - Take it away, guys. She's all yours. (ominous music) Come on, ya little whore. Ya did it for me, you can do it for my buddies. (gun firing) (Lori screams) - [Judge] Lori Christiansen, you are remanded to the custody of the North State Correctional female facility on a preliminary charge of manslaughter. Your case will be reviewed in six months at which time (mumbling). (soft twinkling music) - Did you take care of that little dope fiend like I told ya? - Yup, she's dusted. (machine whirring) (suspenseful music) (machine whirring) (ominous music) - Hello, Jen. I hoped I might find you down here some night. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Hello, Jen. I hoped I might find ya down here some night. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. (suspenseful music) Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Hello, Jen. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. Take that off. - No! No, God no! No! No! No! (crying) Don't, don't! No! No! (crying) (Gloria grunting) - What's wrong? - Oh, get me outta here. I don't wanna wake anybody up. They'll kill me. - Where? - Downstairs. There's water in the boiler room and it's away from everything else. (machine whirring) (officer gasps) (ominous ambient music) (Barb screaming) (Barb screams) (Barb crying) (upbeat electronic music) * How much love is gonna bring you around * * I'm heatin' up so won't you hose me down * * Just come to me and don't you make a sound * * My body's hot so why won't ya hose me down * * The time is right to fool around * * So hose me down * All I want is your lips on mine * * I want you now so don't take your time * * Light my torch 'cause this love's just gonna scorch * * Gonna burn if I have to wait * Hose me down, don't be late * Time is right to seek our heart's desires * * How much love is gonna bring you around * * I'm heatin' up so won't ya hose me down * * Just come to me and don't ya make much sound * * Time is right to fool around * So hose me down * All I ask is that ya cool me down * * I'm spinnin' fast, goin' round and round * * Take a chance * Cool this while we dance * It's time to move * Let's start this groove * Hose me down, don't be late * I'm ready now * So please don't hesitate * How much love is gonna - How come you extending visiting hours for this? - You know a girl took her life last night. - The second in a month as I understand it. - I felt this would help relieve the tension. * The time is right to fool around * * So hose me down * All I want is your lips on mine * * I want you now so don't take your time * * Light my torch * This love's just gonna scorch * - You wanna dance? - Rebel, what do you think you're doing? - Nothing you'd understand. - Get back to where you belong. Now! I'd keep my mind on my job if I were you, that is if I wanted to keep it. - We gotta get outta here. I need to get laid bad. Anymore news from your ma? - We're gettin' real close, Rebel. We'll be with Ma sooner than you think. - There's something I think you should know. - Paige, would you get me something to drink, please? Thank you. Don, may I call you Don? I think it would be best if you did not develop a personal relationship with any of my girls. They become very dependent and it can only cause problems. Oh, I wish these girls wouldn't smoke. (hand smacks) What is going on here? - I think this little girl is high, Miss Madison. - Lori, is this true? - No, he came up-- - I'm afraid a night in solitary is all that is going to calm you down, Lori, and then tomorrow we will talk about drugs. Sperrazza, will you take this girl to solitary? * Gonna burn if I have to wait * Hose me down, don't be late * Time is right - Gettin' your kicks, Harper?

(cries out) (women grunting) (women panting) This ain't over yet. - Anytime you say. (thunder rumbles) (ominous music) (door rattles) (gun firing) - I've been waitin' for this. You're gonna get it, little girl. You been askin' for it. You're gonna get it. - Don't. Don't. (Paige crying out) No! (Paige screaming) No. No! No. (lightning cracking) (thunder rumbling) - Barb. Barb! Oh God, somebody help me. Eula! - Rebel, come on, we need your help. - [Don] Get down. - What? - You heard me. Think about somebody else besides yourself for a change. (lightning cracks) (thunder rumbles) (Gloria groaning) - Take even breaths. - Shit, look at all that blood. - That's right, push, push! - I don't think I can watch this. - You've watched worse, bitch. - Go stand by the door and make sure no one comes in. - You bet. (ominous music) (Gloria crying out) (hand smacks flesh) (baby crying) - Look at that. Will ya look at that? - Okay, baby, this is the world. - So, who tells Madison? - Girl, you are walkin' on eggshells with me. - Oh, please, nobody say nothin'. - Come on. What the hell you gon' do with a baby in this joint? - One more word outta you and I'ma break your eyeballs. - Look, nobody tells anybody anything. - What you talkin' about? - We gotta break her outta here. And in the meantime, we'll make a little nest in the basement. - Now we're even. (romantic electronic music) - You were not raped. - I was. - Lori, I know you want to get out of here, but you must know that making up stories is not going to help you. - You put me in solitary, and McCoy came in and raped me. That is the truth. - You are not going to make me believe that my staff could be capable of such actions. - I'm telling you the truth. - Don't do this to me, Lori. - What am I doing? I'm telling you what happened. - You are trying to cause problems for me and I will not allow it. - I was raped. - Don't cross me, Lori. Don't give me problems. You will regret it. - You don't even know what's going on in here. If you did I know you wouldn't be this way. - There is nothing going on in here that I'm not aware of. - This place is coming apart, and if you don't know what's happening, you'd better find out soon. - Don't threaten me, Lori. I can make your time here very easy or very difficult. The decision is yours. (ominous music) Clarissa, get me Dr. DeMarco. (inmate whispering) - Lisa's ma, she was doin' a liquor store. They killed her dead. - Lisa's ma, she was killed in a liquor store. (inmates whispering) (Lisa crying) (Lisa screaming) - Lisa, stop it. Stop. (grunting) (Lisa screaming) (hand smacking) (Lisa crying) (Lisa crying out) (ominous music) - That Valeska is beginning to give me gas. - You wanna do somethin' about it? - She knows too much about what's goin' down. - So? - So, let's take her out. - Anything else? - Yeah, scrub my back. (ominous music) - Excuse me, Miss Stevens, I didn't see you. - Shouldn't you be in the factory? - I am, I just had to go to the little girl's room. - All right, well, get back to where you belong. Now! - Okay. - Rebel, what's shakin', honey? - All kinds of things, honey. - Oh yeah, like what? - Some new stuff just came in. You want in on it? - Do I? You know that I do. - Good. Why don't you come down to the basement with me. Let's see if we can't cut a deal. - You got it. (ominous music) So, what's the deal? - Don't worry, I said we'd cut it. (ominous music) (Valeska gurgling) - Stuff her in that room behind the boiler. They won't find her for years. - [Rebel] What's everybody gon' think happened to her? - She escaped. What do you think, you dumb twat? Go on, get her outta here. - I warned you about interfering, Lori. - Interfering? No one else was handling the situation. What was I supposed to do? - You were supposed to leave whatever had to be done to us. - You didn't seem to be able to do anything. - What does it take to get through to you? - I don't know what you mean. - You know exactly what I mean. You are in very serious danger of ending up under lock and key for a very long time. - Why are you threatening me? Because I did your job. - I do my job. And I do it well. I have been able to convince Paige to see her father. I can convince anyone to do anything, even you. - We'll see. - Yes, we will see. (suspenseful music) - [Waiter] Good afternoon. - I'm glad you decided to see me, Paige. It's important to me that we have this time together. - I'm not here because I wanna be. (diners chattering) - You're my daughter and I love you. - You love me? I've seen how you've shown that. - I know that I've done things that were wrong. - [Paige] Wrong? - I wanna make it up to you. I want you to love me as much as I love you. - You are incredible. - I know what you're thinking. That's in the past. I couldn't help myself. It's a sickness, I know it. Please, under... Try to understand me. Forgive me. - You don't exist for me. You're not even alive. (ominous music) You're dead. I hate you. You brutalized me. - Paige. - I'm in a living hell because of you. You molested me! (diners chattering) - Please, keep your voice down. (diners chattering) - I've seen people deal drugs, sell their bodies. I know who they all are. When I tell what I know, that whole place will come down, and if you come down, too, it makes what I've gone through worth it. You're disgusting! (diners chattering) (ominous music) - What are you in such a hurry for? - Somebody could walk in at any moment. - What are you talkin' about? - Everybody's due in the factory. It's only 4:30. - I don't take chances. - Uh-huh, then what are you doin' here in the first place? - Rebel. - Don't give me shit. You get what you want and I get what I want. - Well, you little bitch. - You love it. Now, give me what you promised. - [Nurse Stevens] You know, Rebel, you're using more of that than you oughta be. - Uh-huh, and I ain't the only one. Now gimme. Now get out. - Rebel. - We've both got what we came here for. You can get me off, but that's it. Now I want some real action. I don't want a bitch, I want a man. - [Dr. DeMarco] Oh, Marina, I've been looking for you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, you know the files in the basement? - [Marian] Mm-hm. - Well, there's some records I need. I think you'll find them in these stacks. Could you do this for me? - If you want. - Thanks. (ominous music) - Scared ya? - No. (grunts) - I thought it was about time you and me had a little talk. - About what? - Look, don't bullshit me, lady. You got busted for dealin', right? - So they say. - So, how'd ya like to keep on doin' business right here on the inside? - I would not like. (hand smacks) - You gotta learn to play nice. Think it over. We'll talk again. Maybe this'll help you remember. (foot thuds) (Marina grunts) (Paige crying out) - Don't, it's not your business. (ominous music) (Paige crying out) (hand smacks) (Paige cries out) - Paige just took a bad fall down the stairs. (suspenseful electronic music) - Haldol, Demerol, morphine. There are great amounts of the supplies missing, Dr. DeMarco, and I want an explanation. - There's no explanation necessary, Miss Madison. The demand in the last few months has exceeded the supply. We've had to use the reserves to keep these girls under control. - Who do you think you are talking to, the (mumbles)? You would have to intake every girl in this facility four times a day, every day of the week, for a year to deplete all the reserves. - There has been a certain amount of petty theft. - Petty theft? I think not. - Some of these girls are very cunning. - And speaking of the girls, I have been hearing some very disturbing rumors regarding your behavior with some of them. - From who? Valeska? - You are aware that she has left us. I have my sources. - Oh, I'm sure you do. - Are these stories true? - [Dr. DeMarco] You've been talking to girls who are looking for early releases and you know it. They'd say anything to get out of here. - We will see. I want answers from you and I want them very soon, Dr. DeMarco. Do I make myself clear? - [Dr. DeMarco] Crystal clear. - Good. Just remember. - Yes? - I am keeping my eye on you. (romantic synthesizer music) - Somebody left the steam table on. - I've been waiting for ya. I wasn't sure you'd come. - She's dead. - Who? - She's dead. - Lori, what? Lori? Easy. (Lori crying) - Nobody did anything. I, I-- - What happened? - They came in and took her. I didn't know. I didn't-- - Who? Who are you talking about? - Paige. They made it look like an accident, but they killed her. They killed her. - Who, who killed her? - [Lori] Lisa, Rebel. What does it matter? They're all the same. We're all the same. - Lori, you know that's not true. - We're all the same. We come here and something happens. No matter what we were before, we end up like all the rest of them. Nobody matters, nobody. - Lori. - No, don't. I don't know if I can ever... - Yes, you can. You aren't everybody else, you're different. - God, what's happening to me? What's happening? I don't feel anything. Hold me. Hold me tight. Hold me tight. - [Dr. DeMarco] Baby, you are some little piece. - I wish I could say the same, Doc, but frankly, you may be the worst lay I ever had in my whole little life, and that includes that hype nurse of yours, too. Oh, by the way. - Yes? - Them drugs you was gon' give me? - Yes? - Why don't ya just keep 'em, honey? It really wasn't worth it. Consider this a mercy fuck. (upbeat electronic music) - (speaking in foreign language), baby. I didn't know this was gonna happen. - What? - Marina, I gotta tell you something. The bust? It was me who got you in here. - What? - Marina, there's a lot of money involved. I got a deal with DeMarco, Stevens, and somebody else, and I just thought that if you were in here for a while, you know, well, you could help me out. - You son of a bitch. - No, no, Marina. - You dirty bastard son of bitch. - [Eula] You suckers leave her alone, (mumbles) blood. (inmates shouting) - Put her in restraints. This is going to be fun. (inmates shouting) Get her! - [Inmate] No, you guys! (inmates chattering) - [Woman] Get out.
