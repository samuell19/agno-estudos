J woke up this morning j j same old thing j j nothing to do j j; Wait for that horn to ring j j ring, ring, ring j let me tell you something about fame. There is a moment with fame, recognition, and then it's over. Then you chase it, trying to stay on that high. When you get successful, it's something and you're young, it's easy to lose perspective. It's easy to forget what you were doing that got you successful, what inspired you to become successful, and that happened to me. My inspiration was always the thought of being free. Free of doubt. Free of fear writing songs made life a little more livable. Then I lost it. I lost my voice. My name is sunny. And I'm an addict. Boom, boom, boom, yeanh. Tyes to me, go. Go, go, go, spread out.

Bring it in, let's do this thing. What's up buday? All right, full disclosure, t was a full-on addict. You know, I was snorting coke, I was shooting up. I was drunk all the time. Spent the first year of my kids' life in rehab. And I'm telling you this sunny, 'cause, I feel like you need some help and, I've been down that, that long, dark, shitty road and I'm not judging you, okay. But buddy, drugs or no drugs, you are lost. And you're sinking fast, man. You're at the point where you're giving up. And we all see this. But you gotta make the decision, you gotta make the choice and you gotta do it now. 'Cause you re either gonna die or youre gonna reach out and start pulling yourself up and let us help you. I don't know, we just don't wanna see you do anything you can't come back from, you know? You know how I feel man. I fucking love you brother. I love you too. Sunny, you still have it, I know that. Fuck the house. That's what I said. New house, new life. Okay? Thank you. Thank you all. J who was around when we had a dollar to our name j j we didn't care much for the fortune or the fame j j we were just keeping law j j we knew the good lora would get us through j when the emotions, the pain became too much, the thoughts of death and dying found their home. What I realized? Death is not the greatest loss in life. To me the greatest loss is what dies inside you while you're still alive. You don't like something? Change it. And if you can't change it, change the way you think about it. [T's okay to ask for help. Everybody needs help at some point in their life. & cause we all live, we all die j j but it hurts if we don't try j my epiphany? I ove. It took someone yanking me out of my black cloud and shaking me with love. Letting me know they loved me. Unconditionally. J I can't be what this world wants of me j I don't claim to have all the answers. But I do know I have today. Watch after my boy. Be there for him. See me soon. S we keep marching strong and helping those we see j I love you sunny. You're a special dude, man, remember that. I mean, man, live for me, have a good life. Right? Yeah. That's what I want. & cause we all live, we all die j j but it hurts if we don't try j just lost, just lost. But un. Look, I know we. We have our differences, we... I want you to know something. I would do anything for you. Regardless of what I said to you or anybody else, I am always there for you. Look what we made in there. Pretty special hun? And that's forever I love you. I'm really glad you're okay. Mmm, how you feeling? - Good. - Yeah? How you feeling? I'm good. You look different. I bet. I wanna read something to you. Is that okay? Yeah. Better yet. How about you read it? - Okay. - Jules. Come up here. Now? Whenever you're ready, go for it. I don't even know where to start. [Sunny and sunnyboy I so I'll just in. I'm bringing all the positive things back in my life. Shedding all the fat. I lost the fight that I once had after a failed marriage and, being away for so long, I just, I just dian't want to chase the race anymore. Fame, fortune, all that shit. So I hung it up to be with you guys. 10 raise you guys, to take you to school. Coach your sports. Watch all your great performances. And I raised you two to be, great people, special. At least I think. I lost a sense of myself. I lost, a sense of who I was. Oh man, I was just, I've been down on myself for so long. Almost 10 years, I was circling the drain. I almost gave up. If there was an off switch, I probably would have turned it off. But somehow and someway, I didn't. Now it's time to get back up. It's time to get back in the world, be present in my life. I've always loved you guys so much. You re everything to me. Life is too short. And you guys deserve to see me in my best. How you doing buddy? Uh, pretty, pretty good. How are you doing? I'm really good. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah? Yeah. Something's different about you. It's in your eyes, I can see it all in your eyes. You look like the old sunny. Are you back? Dad said you'd be back. He did? Yeah. You know, I was waiting this entire time for you, right? That's what friends do. I gotta take a shower man. Go do your homework. It don't have homework. Go write a synopsis or something. Okay, I'll write a poem, how about that? Write a poem. 2:30, I'll come here at 2:30. - 2:30, tomorrow. - 2:30, tomorrow. Hey Sean. Yeah? If you need anything. If you need a friend. Or a dad or. Anything. I'm here. Gooaq. Thanks coach. Thank you. I appreciate you. Get out of here. All right, I'll see you tomorrow at 2:30, remember. - 2:30. - Love ya.
