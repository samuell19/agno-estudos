What... What are you doing? ﻿It's early... Stay in bed... ﻿Good morning. (Arabic) -hello. (Arabic) ﻿Good morning. ﻿It's alright, I... I'm meeting someone. ﻿Yes, yes, it's me that you spoke to. ﻿You're Sayeed? -Yes, I'm Sayeed. ﻿Sayeed what? ﻿What? ﻿Sorry, it wasn't you that I spoke to. -No, no, you spoke to me. ﻿Renovations, right? ﻿Sure, you spoke to me... ﻿What's my name? If we spoke. ﻿Uh... ﻿When did we speak? -No, it wasn't you. ﻿What's the problem? I'm good, take me, I'm really good, renovations. ﻿I'm really good... -No. ﻿No? ﻿Get out, please. ﻿Fine. Kiss my ass. ﻿Naftali? -Yes, get in the car. ﻿Are you okay? -Yes. ﻿You said you've been working in renovations for 20 years. ﻿Oh... ﻿Sayeed couldn't come today. ﻿His wife gave birth yesterday, and the baby started coughing last night ﻿and they were worried so they took her to the hospital. ﻿But we work together. ﻿He can't just send one of his workers for this. ﻿One of his workers? I'm his brother. ﻿Look... ﻿"Abu Sayeed and Sons Renovations" ﻿See? ﻿We work together. ﻿Let's call him. -Go ahead. ﻿Maybe he's in surgery, Naftali. ﻿Can you do what Sayeed can do? ﻿Yes, sure. ﻿He told me what the job is, I know what I'm doing. ﻿Can you do electrical work? -Of course, I studied electricity. ﻿And concrete casting, woodwork, paint, you name it. ﻿Sayeed also said you have some doorposts to do, right? ﻿Yes, there are some doorposts. ﻿What's the problem? ﻿No problem, I can do it. Why not? ﻿What's your name again? ﻿Fahed. Nice to meet you. ﻿Here... ﻿is the small house, my studio. ﻿But first we have to go there... to pick up some stuff. ﻿"Paritzky Grates" ﻿Paritzky? ﻿Paritzky? ﻿Good morning. -Good morning. ﻿Aren't you a bit early? -I told you I'd be here before 7:00. ﻿This is my worker. Come. ﻿Good morning. ﻿This is yours. -Okay. ﻿There's more stuff in the back. ﻿Here, three sandbags and one with cement. ﻿Use the cart. ﻿I'm giving you an extra 2% off. -Oh, thank you very much. ﻿Here are the grates you asked for, remember? ﻿Where did you find this guy? ﻿My gardener recommended him. ﻿I need a bowl to mix this. Got one...? -There should be... ﻿Also for the grout and the... ﻿It's the firing range the army base. Don't worry. ﻿The amazing thing about it, is that after a while you just don't hear it any more. ﻿Listen, unload the rest of the stuff from the car. ﻿I'll be right with you, I just need to find this file. ﻿What kind of file? ﻿Is it a Word doc? I can help... ﻿I work with computers. ﻿It's a video. I don't know the file's type. It's okay, I'll be right with you. ﻿I'll be with you in a second. ﻿Take a look around... ﻿in the meantime. ﻿Fuck... ﻿This place should be destroyed, ﻿no point fixing it. but I'm renting it, it's not mine. ﻿Don't worry, we'll leave this crack there, I don't like 'to cover'. There's a crack. ﻿It's not a crack. ﻿Yes, you're right, it's not a crack, it's... ﻿it's broken. ﻿There are no foundations in this house and the earth moves here. ﻿Look at the cracks in the floor. ﻿No foundations? ﻿They flattened the ground, put a concrete floor and built it up from there, like Lego. ﻿Tell me, is there a red foam? ﻿You know, that material that inflates? ﻿Or we can use regular foam and paint it red. ﻿That's my fantasy. ﻿Red cracks. ﻿I don't think such red foam exists. ﻿Okay, listen. I have to go home, I say, you can start with the... ﻿No problem. I'll start preparing for painting. Scraping, sealing... ﻿I'll cover everything, and when... - Okay. ﻿When you return we'll look at all the... - Great. Bye. ﻿Daddy, look! ﻿What happened? -Listen... ﻿Did something just break? ﻿No, Tomer's ball got away. Did anything break, Tomer? ﻿I think your statuette's bent a little. ﻿Where are you? -Downstairs, in the bathroom. ﻿Are you taking them? ﻿I'm already upstairs working. I have my panel tomorrow, remember? ﻿Sure, no problem. ﻿And take the check for the school, it's on the fridge. They called yesterday. ﻿No problem. Listen, I brought a worker this morning... ﻿Daddy, you promised me that today... ﻿Yuck. Dad! ﻿What did you bring? ﻿Is he an Arab? -He already said he's an Arab. ﻿Palestinians are Arabs, right, Dad? -Uh... Yes. ﻿I guess every Palestinian is an Arab. ﻿Sure. ﻿There are Arabs here who are both Israeli and Palestinian. ﻿that are both Israeli and Palestianian, ﻿like the worker I brought he's both Israeli and Palestinian. ﻿We're also Palestinians in a way, ﻿because we were born in Palestine. ﻿I don't get it. -Stop it. -Cut it out, you guys. ﻿Will he paint my room? -Stop it, stupid. You're stupid! ﻿- He is working in the small house. ﻿So what, will he paint my room? ﻿In black. ﻿He'll paint your room dark black. ﻿Bye, Tomer. ﻿At least walk me to my classroom. ﻿Ok, but let's make it quick. I have a busy day today. ﻿I have an important meeting this afternoon ﻿and I have the renovations. ﻿Is he nice? -Very nice. ﻿Wait, who? -The worker. ﻿Very nice. ﻿What's his name? -Bustin. Bustin' his ass. ﻿Oh dear! Let me talk to her. ﻿What happened? I can't hear you. ﻿What happened, Dad? -I don't know. ﻿Are you there? ﻿Bye, sweetie. -Dad, you promised to walk me. ﻿I can't, I don't have time. ﻿Yes, at Paritzky's. ﻿That's right, where the horses are. ﻿Okay, I'll grab my coffee and I'll be right over. ﻿is there a suspect? ﻿"Paritzky" ﻿Yeah, we have a suspec... ﻿Fahed? ﻿Fahed! ﻿(Arabic) ﻿My boss is back. ﻿God willing. ﻿God willing. Bye. ﻿What's up? ﻿I don't like you talking on the... There's plenty of work to do. ﻿Who were you talking to with those gestures? He's my music partner. ﻿No shit. ﻿What kind of music? -Rap. ﻿Rap? ﻿Want to hear? ﻿Sure. ﻿I'll... I'll send you a link. ﻿Great. ﻿I found the file you were looking for. It﻿'s on the desktop. ﻿Right. ﻿Yes, that's the file. ﻿Did you watch it? ﻿Of course not. ﻿Come check this out. ﻿It's also an experience, a challenge, ﻿a mission if you want one, ﻿And a two-dayjob. ﻿Israelis and Palestinians just need to talk. ﻿We can do it this way... Or this way... Or this way... ﻿Or we can start here. ﻿Straight and to the point. ﻿Nice. ﻿Nice. You're a good Jew. ﻿If only there were more like you. ﻿There are plenty like me. Jews and Palestinians, plenty. ﻿This is going to be a hit. If it sticks it could be huge. ﻿We all have to try, it won't come out of nowhere. ﻿It's like a desk. If you want a desk you build a desk. ﻿Know what I mean? -Yes. ﻿And it could make a real difference. ﻿It's got media. That brings people together. ﻿I really believe in it. -Yes, it's nice. ﻿It's a little... ﻿a little naive, isn't it? ﻿Totally, but not impossible. ﻿God willing. ﻿All right... ﻿Well, I put all the stuff in the middle of the room, ﻿and covered them. -I saw. ﻿Now I'll start scraping in the kitchen or applying grout here, whatever... ﻿That place we went to this morning, at Paritzky's, something happened there. ﻿What? -I don't know. ﻿What did you hear? ﻿I didn't hear anything, but... ﻿maybe I'll go check it out. ﻿Naftali. How are you? -What's up? ﻿I saw you last night in some movie on the cable channel. What was it? ﻿Porn, maybe? ﻿You were great. -Thanks. ﻿A ninth grader, just a poor girl. -How did they find her? . ﻿Was she covered in blood? Naked? -No, no. ﻿I said she was attacked. I said she cried. I didn't say she was naked. ﻿Probably some thief. ﻿Poor Paritzky, since his wife died... Nothing buttrouble. ﻿A week ago some Arab broke in and stole his new HD plasma screen. ﻿Left the window open in the middle of the night. ﻿Was he caught? -How can he be caught? ﻿So how do you know it was an Arab? -That's what Paritzky said. ﻿There's an outbreak of thefts from a nearby village. Don't be naive. ﻿It's not necessarily an Arab., -Then why do you say "Arab"? Not nice. ﻿Say, Naftali, weren't you here with your worker this morning? ﻿Yes. ﻿Where is he now? ﻿Working. Did you hear what happened? -What happened? ﻿The girl who works for Paritzky was assaulted, apparently. ﻿You're kidding. Who is she? ﻿Some teenager, she lives back there with her mother. ﻿Oh, the daughter of that... ﻿What do you mean, assaulted? Sexually?! ﻿I don't exactly know. ﻿Whoa! How scary. ﻿The weird thing is that I stopped by there this morning to pick up some stuff ﻿with Fahed the worker, and now when I passed by... ﻿The guys there... - Who's Fahed? ﻿The worker I brought. I told you. ﻿No, you didn't tell me. ﻿The Palestinian worker ﻿the gardener recommended. -You didn't tell me. ﻿I did. ﻿When did you tell me? -This morning when I went to get him. ﻿No, you didn't tell me. Never mind. ﻿Naftali! ﻿Naftali! ﻿Naftali! -Let's just go. ﻿Is that the worker? ﻿Excuse me... -Naftali! ﻿Maybe he has something to do with the attack at the Paritzky's... ﻿No, no way. ﻿I was hardly away from here for half an hour to an hour. ﻿Come on, Tali, do you really think that while he was working for you, ﻿he took a tea break and went to rape Paritzky's neighbor? ﻿That's ridiculous. ﻿Go see the work he did, there is no way he had time for a quickie. ﻿I'm stuck here. It's so shitty. ﻿Naftali! -Bring me the chain cutter! Don't ask... ﻿Oh, here you are. ﻿Finish your call. ﻿Regarding his output... -I recommended him to you! He's... ﻿It's not Sayeed, it's his brother. -But he works with him! ﻿They're a good family, don't worry. What are you going to do? ﻿Tali! -I don't know. ﻿Alright. Bring me the cutter... -Bye. ﻿You weren't here when they took him away. He didn't want to go. ﻿You were in the house. ﻿I saw you running after them. -Yes... ﻿But I was worried, I... didn't know what was going on. he's working for you, right? ﻿Yes. -Yes. ﻿Especially now, with everything that's happening. ﻿You watched "60 Minutes" last night. Scary stuff. ﻿And suddenly two cops show up. You're supposed to relax when you see cops, right? ﻿Well, I didn't. I got scared. ﻿Sorry, but... ﻿What did he do, anyway? ﻿Nothing, I think. -They said, "at least four hours". ﻿If they let him go. He's at the police station by the sports center. ﻿Four hours? -Yes, doesn't seem so long to me. ﻿You've wanted to fix the place up for a while, huh? - Yes. ﻿Bummer. He didn't get much done. ﻿Excuse me? ﻿No discharges now. She went out for a smoke. ﻿You're with the worker, right? -Yes. ﻿Who are you? -Zion, criminal lawyer. ﻿Nice to meet you. ﻿Naftali, I think they've got nothing on him. -Really? ﻿So...? They'll let him go? ﻿Depends. As far as I know they haven't even spoken to her, ﻿she locked herself in her room. -Then why did they arrest him? ﻿That was my question exactly. -How can they do this? ﻿They'll appoint a juvenile detective for her. ﻿Careful. -Which means? ﻿At least a week of waiting and a third party guarantee. ﻿Maybe. Let's hope. -Which is? ﻿Besides a token fee for me, it doesn't cost you a penny. ﻿But if they want him for further ﻿If he doesn't, it's at least $7000. They're difficult to bargain with. ﻿Unless he has relatives or someone that is willing to bail him out. ﻿Zion... ﻿Where were you? -Be right with you. ﻿The bright side is that if the subject of bail comes to the table ﻿then it means that he didn't do it. But they won't just let him go. ﻿And that's where the person posting bail comes in the picture. ﻿They're done questioning him. Wait a minute, okay? ﻿Well? -I'm waiting forever... ﻿Where are you? -No, I... ﻿Anat the Producer: What a mess! Unbelievable. Worst comes to worst I'll take a taxi. ﻿This son of a bitch. ﻿- Don't tell... -Go, Bye. ﻿Hello? ﻿Tali: I don't feel comfortable leaving him here. ﻿You think they beat him up? ﻿They may have slapped him a bit, to wake him up, get him in the mood. ﻿Geez... -What do you expect? ﻿Cops are the second most frustrated sector in the country. ﻿By the way, we got approval for posting bail. ﻿Are you checking? ﻿If someone will sign for him? -Oh... ﻿Anat the Producer: I'm touched. ﻿The hotter it is, the hungrier I get. ﻿Okay. ﻿Let's say I decide I don't want to be his guarantor any more... ﻿I just don't know how long he'll be working for me. ﻿Don't worry about it. ﻿Just let him bring someone else. ﻿Take my card and call me if you have any questions. ﻿No problem. ﻿Fahed. ﻿Fahed. ﻿Thank you. ﻿So what happened? ﻿Did they slap you around? ﻿Yes, they did... those sons of bitches. They're always like that. ﻿Are you sure you can continue? ﻿Yeah, of course. ﻿What did they ask you? ﻿A lot of questions. ﻿They wanted to know why I went back to Fritzky's. ﻿When? ﻿After you left. ﻿Wait, you went back to Paritzky's? ﻿Yes, we left the scrapers there. I left you a note on the door. ﻿I needed the scrapers to scrape the walls, I didn't want to just sit around waiting for you. ﻿And? ﻿Got something for a headache? ﻿Do you? ﻿Didn't you ask them? ﻿And what happened? Did you see her? Talk to her? ﻿I saw her when I got back... ﻿with the scrapers. ﻿Standing by a bush, crying. ﻿I just wanted to make her laugh. ﻿So you hit on her. ﻿I just asked her if she... works for her father. ﻿But she said that Paritzky isn't her father. ﻿I don't know, I don't remember. He put the stuff in the car. ﻿I don't remember that we did take the scrapers. ﻿Because you didn't take the scrapers! You forgot them and Sayeed ﻿made the extra effort to go and get them. -Fahed. ﻿Be thankful. You're the contractor. What's wrong with you? ﻿Call your shrink. Let him change your pills. ﻿Fuck, my lawnmower got wrecked this morning. ﻿Listen, if you'd taken a worker from the neighborhood next by ﻿he would've sat there smoking and talking on the phone. ﻿Can you imagine an Arab raping you? -Who said she was raped? ﻿Just kidding. Give me the ratchet, C'mon! ﻿How do you know it was an Arab? -What's up, Tuli? ﻿Okay. ﻿You folks... What can I tell you? I'm coming by tomorrow, maybe I'll stop in. ﻿Yes, do it. Bye. ﻿Lost some weight, huh? Looking good. ﻿Thanks. I'm not even trying, I'm kind of worried. ﻿You look great too. -Thanks, Tuli. ﻿I have no choice. ﻿I see they released him. -Uh... yes. ﻿Nice of them. ﻿They let him go? -Yes. ﻿His dad's probably a snitch... Poor girl. ﻿Locked herself in her room, she ran away. -Really? ﻿Yes, but I just heard that she's back at home. ﻿You don't say. -Yes. ﻿You need a juvenile detective and you need to wait in queue for one, ﻿it's worse than an HMO clinic. ﻿He didn't do it. ﻿We happened to be at Paritzky's, I bought a few things. ﻿I heard he was hanging around there. -He was with me. ﻿He carried the sandbags... -But you left him by himself. ﻿For half an hour. ﻿So? ﻿And he went back? -Yes, he went back. ﻿We forgot the scrapers so he went back to get them, what's with you guys? ﻿The police let him go, if they had anything on him they'd never let him go. ﻿Of course not. ﻿What if he disappears on us? ﻿We have to talk to Yuval. ﻿Yuval? I'm telling you, he didn't do it. ﻿Why bring Yuval into this? -I want to talk to Yuval. ﻿Go ahead, talk to Yuval. -I will talk to Yuval. ﻿Go talk to Yuval. ﻿I sure will talk to Yuval. ﻿That was annoying. ﻿But she's cute, isn't she? ﻿What an ass. ﻿Well... ﻿Check that out. ﻿Shoo! ﻿Okay, but they released him. ﻿Okay, then why should they come here? ﻿But why? ﻿Who are you talking to? ﻿Okay. Bye. ﻿Are you going out? ﻿I have the meeting about the project now. They moved it up to today. ﻿No Aspirin? -That was Tzila, she says they're coming over. ﻿They're being disgusting. We shouldn't encourage them. ﻿I won't. -"I won't." ﻿Oh, here it is. What do they want? ﻿I don't know, maybe to go out to the small house and question your Arab. ﻿Not that you really care about the Arab, but what about the renovations? ﻿Don't want you to get upset. ﻿Yes, it sucks to waste time and money on a band of primitive Neanderthals. ﻿Are you leaving? -Yes. ﻿Who will talk to them? -They can talk to me. ﻿The police released him, didn't they? ﻿Don't worry, honey, it'll be okay. I just can't afford to be late. Bye. ﻿Here's my number, call me, so i'll have yours. ﻿Aspirin. ﻿I'm back in 2-3 hours. ﻿Who did you call Neanderthals? ﻿Oh, that was nothing... ﻿Try to get things moving here quickly. ﻿But you're leaving me the key, right? ﻿Okay. ﻿Wow... ﻿Thank you so much. ﻿Gladly. -You're amazing. ﻿I was talking about you yesterday... I'm embarrassing myself... ﻿How funny... Say, are you going to be in... ﻿We are in a meeting here, waiting... -Oh, sorry. ﻿Thanks. -Thank you. Good luck. ﻿We don't have to do anything. ﻿Your creation is bigger than you. ﻿So just breathe. You'll be awesome. ﻿Okay, before I show you the video, ﻿I should mention that it's sort of a reality show, ﻿maybe docu-reality. "Yael" ﻿Take it if it's important, we're in no hurry. ﻿Go ahead, answer. ﻿Honey, I'm right in the middle here. ﻿Some people here want to talk to you. ﻿Some people here want to talk to me, too. ﻿-And Tzila. Good afternoon. ﻿Where is he? Isn't he in the little house? ﻿He's... -I just want to take his picture. ﻿I can't talk now and neither can he, he's working, ﻿so please don't bother him. ﻿We knocked, he doesn't open. -And he won't, either. Okay? ﻿Why not? -Because I asked him not to. ﻿He's working. -And we're stopping him? ﻿All I want is a photo... ﻿I brought an Arab to my village to do some renovations and... ﻿Tali, please come home now. ﻿I'm right in the middle. Why did you open the door? ﻿So now it's my fault? Please come home now. ﻿Fine. -And Anat can take a taxi. ﻿Fine, okay. ﻿Okay, we're talking rooms in restaurants, on roofs, in cabins, in construction sites, ﻿even in tents. ﻿Dozens of places all along the Green Line (the 67' border). ﻿where Israelis and Palestinians . will spend two days working ﻿on conducting a negotiation. ﻿It's basically documenting a mediation process ﻿What more can you ask for? ﻿It's all right. ﻿Yes... ﻿Now multiply 50 places ﻿at least 20 people a week _ because it's 5 times 5 each week, ﻿and you get 50,000 people a year, and that can make a difference. ﻿Yael: They've surrounded the small house. ﻿If you have to leave... -No, what I... ﻿There's too much conflict here. ﻿I beg your pardon? ﻿Who's going to watch this? - Why? What's more interesting ﻿than watching two peoples in conflict, ﻿with loads of hatred and degradation... ﻿Two hot chicks with loads ﻿Are you in a bad mood today? Is that it? ﻿-Then start taking notes, please. ﻿Tali, you know how much I love and appreciate you, but... ﻿we have to be realistic. Who wants to watch Arabs on prime time? ﻿We're talking television, we're talking ratings. ﻿How can I put this on prime time TV? ﻿Go ahead, answer. ﻿"Fahed" ﻿Naftali!... ﻿Take this rod! ﻿They broke the window to get into... ﻿Put it in the keyhole... -I'm got locked in the bathroom! ﻿But you broke a window. What do you think you're doing? ﻿We asked him... "Only a photo". ﻿So Haim leaned on the window a little. ﻿So I'll come by tonight and lean on all your windows. ﻿I'll even bring a few Arab guys from the adjacent villages to lean. ﻿We'll relax and lean on your windows, all of you! -Go to Shmueli, ﻿get measurements on the window. ﻿I'll give you the measurements. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Water? ﻿Everything's okay? ﻿Good thing you called, Haim was a bit hysterical. ﻿Thank you very much. -He's okay? ﻿Great, that's all that matters. -He's... Yes. ﻿Look at this. ﻿I can't believe it, they broke into my studio. ﻿-What are they thinking? ﻿I don't know. But... ﻿you're staying here, right? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿While he's here, I mean. ﻿It's not that ﻿I have no problem with... ﻿Just that we're having a birthday party for my niece, so... ﻿Okay. ﻿-Okay, I'm here. ﻿Thanks, thanks. -I'm here. ﻿Thanks. ﻿You're welcome. ﻿They got some nerve... ﻿What's this... ﻿Naftali, this is Dudu. Listen, the police don't care. ﻿You think they give a damn about some girl getting felt up? ﻿Anyway, the guys here are doing a little detective work, ﻿looking out for strangers in the community. ﻿Bringing her pictures to look at. Nothing unpleasant, okay? ﻿There's no time to waste. Take his picture and send it to this number. ﻿Naftali? ﻿I'm not into all this picture business. -Imagine it is him, God forbid. ﻿Okay? And tomorrow he disappears. ﻿How'll you find him then? It's in your interest, too. ﻿Fine, I'll take his picture and send it to you later. We'll talk. Bye. ﻿Why later? Why not now? ﻿Oded, what's so urgent? -What's so urgent? ﻿Yes, what's so urgent? ﻿A lot of people here are stressed out ..~is that urgent enough for you? ﻿Thanks. ﻿Where's the note? ﻿What note? ﻿You said you left me a note this morning. ﻿Oh. ﻿You know what I think? ﻿What? -Fritzky did it. ﻿Why didn't he open the door for us, this morning? ﻿It did take him a while to open the door. ﻿Found it? ﻿Maybe it's over there. ﻿Maybe I should go home? ﻿No way! ﻿I'm getting you in trouble. I'm in danger here, Naftali. ﻿Is it the money you paid that lawyer? I'll pay you back. ﻿I posted bail for you. -For what? ﻿For me showing up for questioning? I'll show up if I have to. ﻿Forget it, I'm not giving up here, I've dreamt of renovating this place for years. ﻿We barely got started, that's all. ﻿Here. ﻿This is strong stuff. ﻿It's from Gaza, Naftali. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You mean taking your picture? ﻿Let's show them something so they'll leave us alone. ﻿They're obviously lying about something, Naftali. ﻿Maybe it really is Paritzky, but I doubt they'd fabricate anything. ﻿Why not? I'm telling you, they would fabricate... ﻿Don't take my picture. ﻿The first one came out blurry and in the second one you're holding the scraper. ﻿Don't worry, I won't send it. I'll go there myself. ﻿You know what just occurred to me? ﻿If she saw you go back for the scrapers, then she has already seen you. ﻿She has already seen him. We don't need a picture, we can just ask her. ﻿A girl who gets assaulted is in a state of confusion, she may even lose her memory. ﻿she may not remember the face, but she may remember his smell or... ﻿Fine. ﻿But if I'm coming, I'm showing her the photo on my phone. ﻿Come over here and we'll see. ﻿No, no way. ﻿The fact that you're showing her could bias her. ﻿Who's that, Paritzky? ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿Listen, the hard part for her is reenacting what happened. ﻿That's where the juvenile detective comes in. -Pass him on for a moment. ﻿Let's discuss it tomorrow. ﻿Did you release him? ﻿I didn't release him because he isn't in prison. He's a free man. ﻿He finished his workday and left. ﻿You're crazy! ﻿He won't show up tomorrow. Don't you understand? ﻿-He'll show ﻿He'll send his sister-in-law's cousin, you know how they are. ﻿And if he does come? Will you drop this business? ﻿He has to fix up my place. ﻿Make sure he doesn't fix up your daughter. ﻿Fahed? ﻿Lock up and come up. ﻿Put some clothes on, Dana. ﻿Why? ﻿What happened? ﻿Nothing. -Sorry. ﻿Fahed, Yael. Yael, Fahed. ﻿Naftali, I think someone... ﻿was watching me from the street. ﻿From a car? ﻿Yes. ﻿I'll take that. ﻿Good evening. ﻿More water? ﻿Here I've got some electrical work ﻿and two shelves to put in upstairs, silicon in the sink... ﻿Okay, no problem. - That's it. ﻿Can I take a few minutes break first? ﻿And I need that. -Sure. ﻿What do you need the mattress for? -Do you do yoga? ﻿Oh, no. I... want to use it to pray. ﻿don't have to, but if you don't mind... -No, go ahead. ﻿No problem. -Dana, homework. ﻿Now? -Now. ﻿All right... ﻿Here. -Thanks. ﻿He's asleep. ﻿He fell asleep, Dad. ﻿He's asleep. I ﻿also pray. ﻿Really? That's good. ﻿Do you always sit like that when you're praying? ﻿I didn't prepare much food, so you don't miss the train. ﻿When are you taking him? ﻿In an hour and a half or so. ﻿It's okay, we have time. And it's not the last train. ﻿All right... ﻿And pray towards Mecca. ﻿You know what Mecca is? ﻿No? ﻿See? Look. ﻿Wow, so many. ﻿Many, many people. ﻿You know, they say it's such a holy place ﻿that even the pigeons that fly over it ﻿don't poop on it. ﻿But if there is a God, ﻿you can pray wherever, whenever and however you want. ﻿Do you pray too, Dad? -Let's wash our hands. ﻿If you ask me, all that 'Mother Nature' business is a sort of 'God'. ﻿That's exactly what Spinoza says. ﻿Could be. -Not "could be," that's Spinoza. ﻿Okay, in any case, a god of a group of people who promises and punishes ﻿and forgives and rages and avenges, that's not God, that's religion. ﻿And religions have caused a lot of suffering and death throughout history. ﻿So Dad, what do you believe in? ﻿I believe that if you want more salad, you can have more salad. ﻿A little. On the side. ﻿But not all of it, there are others here, too. ﻿That's it. Thanks. ﻿Can I see the picture of Mecca? ﻿How about after dinner, Tomer? ﻿I'm finished. ﻿You know who lived in Mecca? ﻿Muhammad? ﻿Very good. ﻿You know who used to live in Mecca before Muhammad? ﻿Ismail. -Right. Ishmael. ﻿He was also Abraham's son. Like Isaac, they were brothers. ﻿This is actually how we became... cousins. ﻿But Isaac's mother was Sara and Ishmael's mother was their slave. ﻿Right, her name was Hagar, which is a very pretty name. ﻿And they all agreed to it. It's funny. ﻿It's like if you let Dad, have a baby with the housekeeper. ﻿It was normal back then. ﻿Three, four and... ﻿Three, four and... ﻿Three, four and... ﻿Fuck... ﻿Sorry, sorry... -What happened? ﻿It's a short circuit, Mom. -It's okay, Dana, I'm coming. Be careful. ﻿I'm coming, sweetie. ﻿Shit, I didn't save... -The panel is down and to the right. ﻿I worked all night for nothing. ﻿Come, Dana. ﻿He lit the fireplace. ﻿Can't you smell it? -I can. Mom, your turn. ﻿Where did you find him? ﻿The gardener recommended him. I've told you. - So what if you told me? ﻿How does he know him? ﻿He knows his family. ﻿His brother worked for him or something. ﻿So the gardener recommended his brother. -They work together. ﻿Didn't you see his shirt? "Abu Sayeed and Sons." ﻿Shh... ﻿(Cursing in Arabic) I'll go ﻿downstairs. ﻿What does he say? -Who? ﻿Who are you talking to? -My sister. Just a sec. ﻿(Speaking in Arabic) ﻿I just spoke to my sister's husband Yusef. -And? ﻿He said I might be able to bypass the short circuit. ﻿And then... that'll fix the problem. ﻿Just give me... a few minutes and I... ﻿fix it. Don't worry. ﻿I also spoke to Sayeed, I thought he might come help me ﻿but he's not answering, maybe he's in the operating room. ﻿You know, my sister's husband is an electrical expert. ﻿But he went to bed early. "The Sea Women" have a field trip tomorrow. ﻿It's also a peace organization. They take people to the sea. ﻿"The Sea Women". Ever heard of it? ﻿That wasn't on purpose. -Yes it was. ﻿Who was he talking to? ﻿Want to play hide-and-seek? ﻿Aren't you taking him to the train station? ﻿Who was he talking to? -His sister. ﻿I'm sick of this game anyway. -See, you did that on purpose. ﻿When are you taking him to the train station? ﻿Maybe he should just sleep over. ﻿Why? ﻿At this time, for him, to take a train, and two buses... ﻿No, there's no need for him to sleep here. ﻿Dana, it's very late. Go to bed. ﻿Aren't you tired, Tomer? ﻿I have to study for an exam... -You know what? ﻿I'll tell him to sleep in the small house. ﻿Okay. ﻿A little awkward, isn't it? ﻿Why awkward? ﻿I'll get you some bedding. ﻿Okay, get me some bedding. ﻿You'll find blankets downstairs ﻿So you smoke with him, that's the story? ﻿You gave quite a scream at the door, with the garbage... ﻿Not since Passover '99... ﻿I don't want him here. ﻿So that's what this is? ﻿It's all good, till the point where "The Arab" is in your back yard. ﻿And if it is him? ﻿It's a bummer. -No, it's dangerous. ﻿It's a bummer that you don't listen to me, that you always have something to say. ﻿Because you always experiment on me. ﻿Take him to the small house. -He's asleep, what do you want me to do? ﻿Sleeping like a baby. They are not spoiled like us. ﻿He'll fall asleep anywhere you put him, with his clothes on. ﻿And I'm the racist. ﻿It's true, my racism is only natural. ﻿We're all racists, the question is ﻿whether you give in to it or fight ﻿so I'm not going to wake him now, just to take him to the small house. ﻿Then I'll take him. ﻿Yael! ﻿Wait a minute. ﻿Can I tell you what impression I got of him? ﻿Who he is? -Yes, what's your impression of him? ﻿He's a good guy. ﻿He's nice, he's normal. He's just like you and me. ﻿He found a video on my computer that I lost. ﻿I told him about my project. ﻿You shared your peace initiative with him. ﻿I see. ﻿Wait a second. ﻿Things got a little out of hand, that's all. He's better off by my side. ﻿Our neighbors are against him and I posted bail for him. ﻿You what? ﻿You posted bail for him? ﻿Do you want to... ﻿Tell me about your panel tomorrow, while i give you a massage? ﻿Why did you have to post bail for some Arab you don't even know? ﻿Allahu Akbar! ﻿What are you doing here? -He's in the bathroom. ﻿Tomer's stuck in the kitchen, he went to get some water. ﻿What are you... ﻿You woke me up, you were making noise. ﻿You should have nudged me. -I nudged you and you pushed me away ﻿so I woke up Tomer and he was thirsty too. ﻿Naftali? ﻿What's going on? ﻿He was in the bathroom and... he saw me in the kitchen. ﻿He's awake? ﻿I think he fell asleep. -Dad busted his ass with work. ﻿There goes the night sleep... -Let's go upstairs. ﻿Come on, Tomer. ﻿Get in bed. ﻿Well all sleep together tonight. ﻿go back to my room. -No way. ﻿There's no room. -Dana will sleep between us. ﻿Well make room for everyone. ﻿Get out, I want to block the door. And call an electrician already. ﻿You're worse than your dad. -May he rest in peace. ﻿I'd take a worker from the neighborhood next to us, people dont want to work. ﻿Good for you. Out. -That's what the gardener said ﻿and it made perfect sense. ﻿I can't stand that gardener. -People don't want to work. ﻿They're not used to it. They want to be managers, but not really. ﻿More for the... ﻿Feel of it. ﻿I was in the bathroom. ﻿I had something to eat before, in... ﻿in the kitchen. ﻿You didn't flush. ﻿I didn't want to wake you. ﻿What is this? ﻿You fucked us with this blackout. ﻿If you don't understand electricity, just say so. ﻿Maybe the wiring is old. Maybe there's a leak in the wires. ﻿Do you know anything about electricity? ﻿Yes, I studied electricity. ﻿So what? I studied Talmud. Does that mean anything? ﻿When did you study electrical engineering? ﻿In high school? -Yes. ﻿So you get it? ﻿Get what? ﻿If you don't know about electricity, don't touch my electricity. ﻿What don't you get? ﻿I'm not as good with electricity. ﻿"Not as good..." ﻿Sayeed usually does the electrical work but I do it with him. ﻿But it's just you now! ﻿Sayeed isn't here! ﻿Listen, Naftali, maybe something in the wall is old. ﻿"In the wall", "in the wall". Enough already, for fuck's sake... ﻿Just say you don't know. Is it your mentality? ﻿Is it a cultural thing? You're just a... ﻿You're a lying, hateful, bitter Arab, that's what you are. ﻿(Cursing in Arabic) ﻿What did you say? What? ﻿(Arabic) ﻿You forgot the scrapers on purpose, didn't you? ﻿I don't want renovation work anymore! I'm done! ﻿What's going on? ﻿C'mon, Go back to bed. You have to sleep. ﻿We can't sleep like this. We can't sleep with all the noise. ﻿I know, you have a panel tomorrow. ﻿Get back upstairs. -Shame on you. ﻿What's your problem? -Shame on you. ﻿Are you not hearing me? -What are you thinking? ﻿Look at this mess. -Go upstairs. Go up... ﻿Leave me alone! ﻿Oh... ﻿Please go up to bed. ﻿Stay away from me. ﻿Look, Dad. ﻿Look. ﻿It's from his Facebook page. ﻿In brief, he kind of hates Israel. ﻿He's a singer? ﻿How's Mom doing? ﻿Putting on a bandage. ﻿My bag. ﻿Can I show you something? ﻿She added me on Facebook. ﻿Should we call the police? ﻿Why the Police? ﻿Since when are you her friend? -Since now. ﻿Naftali, ﻿if I can get to see her ﻿she'll tell me who did it. ﻿Okay? ﻿How about you take ﻿I didn't touch her, Naftali, ﻿I didn't do anything. ﻿Good morning. ﻿Why is it so dark in here? ﻿Blackout? ﻿My brother-in-law is an electrician, want me to call him? ﻿Electricity is a matter of life and death, it's like security, ﻿you don't take chances. ﻿Yael. ﻿Everybody out. ﻿You too. ﻿Yael! -You heard. ﻿Hold on... -He said out. ﻿Yael. ﻿Did they come to get him? -Tomer... ﻿Where are you going? ﻿She's dropping us off and then going to the hospital. ﻿Dana, let's go. -I sent you a link to his clip. ﻿Call me. To the Emergency Room, please. -Is everything okay? ﻿Everything is alright. ﻿This is the place. -What place? ﻿She's inside with her mother. She'll come to the window and identify him. ﻿Get the rope, let's tie his feet up. ﻿Put your feet together. -Shh... ﻿Put your feet together! ﻿Put them together... -Be quiet. ﻿Don't tie him. ﻿What's your problem, Tali? ﻿I'll... I'll go in and show her the photo. ﻿Why bother? He's here now. ﻿Hands off. -I don't get it. ﻿He wants to go in and show her the photo. ﻿What's so funny, moron? ﻿Who're you calling moron? ﻿Let it go, Yuval. ﻿C'mon, guys. -That's enough... ﻿Stop, stop, stop. -What's with you? ﻿He's getting away! ﻿He's getting away. ﻿Run! ﻿Yuval, what are you doing?! ﻿Relax, shooting in the air is the protocol. -It's not in the protocol. ﻿In the air, I said. Are you deaf? ﻿Fahed! ﻿Five minutes. ﻿Hey! ﻿Hey, give me back my bike! ﻿Do you see him? ﻿Do you see him? ﻿There. ﻿Fahed! ﻿Turn right! Fahed! ﻿Careful. ﻿There is one crossing point to the wadi and it's pretty far. ﻿Maybe Paritzky did it. ﻿Paritzky? -Yes. ﻿You're getting carried away, Tali. ﻿He helps her and her mother and lots of other folks around here. ﻿And what does he get in return? ﻿Where is your head going, man? ﻿You just left the house wide open? -What? ﻿This is Herzl, the electrician. Dudu said you have been without power since yesterday ﻿The front door was locked so I went around, the door was open, so I got in... ﻿It'll cost you 1,000 NIS... -There he is! ﻿Before tax, yeah? - Let's block him. ﻿You said a few minutes. ﻿A few minutes of work, but decades of experience. ﻿Get over here, come on, block his way. ﻿Hi! Be careful! ﻿The bastard got away? w ﻿Are you coming or should I leave the invoice on the table? ﻿What table? -Near the kitchen ﻿Where are you? ﻿At your house, man. Where are you? ﻿Come on! The fuses alone cost 420. ﻿You've got nerve. ﻿Do you realize he messed with the main breaker? ﻿He could have burnt himself, the idiot. ﻿Get out! You're not getting another penny. ﻿What a jerk. ﻿Hello, Zion, this is Naftali. ﻿We met yesterday at the... ﻿At the Police station. -What's up, Naftali? Sure I remember. ﻿He ran away. ﻿Your worker? -Yes. ﻿He ran away? ﻿Yes, and I was thinking of getting someone else, so I thought maybe... ﻿we could forget all the... ﻿That would be a problem. ﻿It would be a problem, but he'll probably come back if you need him, right? ﻿Or bring him in to the police station. You can't neglect your bail responsibility ﻿and then expect that they let you off. ﻿Listen, you gave your word. ﻿If it gets too messy, just call the police. Simple... ﻿Give me a call after you deside. Bye. ﻿Tali, we need your worker's phone number. ﻿What's the number,Tali? Tali we need your worker's... ﻿Are you all right? -Tali, you're scaring me, are you okay? ﻿Okay... ﻿I'm checking... What? ﻿Give us the number. ﻿Maybe he's still around. ﻿I get it, but Yardena, that's why Zehavit spoke to the CEO. ﻿Okay. I'm holding. ﻿Well catch him for sure. ﻿Dead or alive? ﻿Huh? ﻿Chasing Arabs is easy. Try to chase a Jew who owes you money. ﻿I installed three new fuses. ﻿(Voicemail:) Hi, you reached Yael... ﻿Got some sweets? ﻿Any cookies left?... Oh. ﻿Here. ﻿Oh, it's dietetic. You lose weight as you eat, huh? ﻿How's the wife? ﻿I was just... ﻿Fine, she's fine. -It'll be okay, don't worry. ﻿How much bail did you post? ﻿Take your time. ﻿Many thanks, Yardena, thanks a lot. ﻿Good job, Yuval... -Yuval's the man. ﻿Wow, great timing, look who's here. ﻿There's my man. -Hello! ﻿You rock star. -How's it going? You guys rock! ﻿Well? ﻿We've tracked down his mobile in the wadi / Highways. ﻿Is it static? -Yes. ﻿Weak signal. He must be under the bridge. ﻿Everyone needs a rest, even a fast Palestinian. ﻿I heard he did a somersault on the bike. Is he a circus runaway Arab? ﻿It's not funny. He got away, okay? ﻿All right, let's move out. Anybody not coming? ﻿Me. ﻿Someone needs to work here. ﻿I'm not through with you, I'll be back, you bastard. ﻿Let's go. Tali, you come with me. ﻿Let's go to the vehicle, I'll give you radios. ﻿Haim, don't tie up the line. And turn on your Waze (GPS). ﻿Dudu, you'll come from the east. ﻿Okay. -Let's go. ﻿I can see you. Go to the bridge and wait on top. ﻿Don't go down to the wadi. ﻿Boaz, Boaz. ﻿Where are you, Boaz? ﻿No phones, please. ﻿Boaz? ﻿Did you call earlier to ask if your wife Yael was treated in the hospital? ﻿Boaz! ﻿Yes, yes. ﻿Boaz should be corning this way. ﻿Are you her husband? -Yes. ﻿You don't sound so sure. -Boaz, we can't wait. ﻿Someone's sleeping next to me... ﻿Tali... ﻿Please hold. -I said no phones. ﻿My wife is in the hospital. -Oh, okay. ﻿I heard what happened. But make it quick. ﻿Naftali? -Yes. ﻿Sorry for the wait. Listen, I'm not allowed to... ﻿Well, according to the doctor, she said that you had pushed her. ﻿You understand? -That's not what happened. ﻿C'mon. -Is she still there? ﻿Tali. - No, she was discharged. ﻿Okay, thank you. ﻿What's up with Boaz? ﻿We can't wait for them. ﻿Call him. ﻿Here it is. ﻿Hang up already! ﻿Your wife? ﻿No, it's the... gardener who recommended Fahed. ﻿Put it on speaker. ﻿What's up, killer? -How's it going? ﻿I told you to stay with him. You're the contractor, don't you get it? ﻿What? ﻿I told you, if you leave him alone he'll start making tea. ﻿I'm outside the small house, he won't let me in. ﻿Hello. Open up. ﻿He hears me but he isn't responding, Tali. ﻿What's up? (Arabic) ﻿Naftali. -Aiwa (Arabic), Tali. ﻿Tali, he wants to talk to you, talk to him ﻿Naftali. -Yes? ﻿I'm in the small house with Yaara. ﻿Are you coming? ﻿Come alone. ﻿Okay, I'll be right there. ﻿The little house? ﻿My studio. ﻿Where he was supposed to renovate. ﻿Why didn't you say he had a key to your studio? ﻿Everything's okay, I'm about to meet the guys. ﻿Just relax, Hadas, it's all right. Hold on, Hadas. ﻿She's crying her eyes out. Yaara is missing again. We know. He kidnapped her to his studio. ﻿He didn't kidnap her. ﻿Sure, maybe she's helping with the renovations. ﻿What if I show you that they're friends on Facebook? ﻿Where's Oded? He has his phone. -This is an Amber Alert, man, a kidnap. ﻿He's a musician. ﻿This is his music, listen. ﻿He didn't kidnap her. -Turn that crap off. ﻿Turn it off, Tali, it's not the right time for it. -He thinks this is a TV series. ﻿Want Clonex? I have some in my wallet. ﻿Do you have a megaphone? -Sure. All is good. ﻿You got here fast. Bravo. ﻿Come, come, come! ﻿Did you see her? ﻿You didn't hear anything? Something she said? Crying? ﻿I heard something. Not... ﻿He made two cups of coffee, that's for sure. -Pass the megaphone. ﻿Actually tea. ﻿You're surrounded. ﻿Tali, what's his name? -Where's Oded? Let's... ﻿I asked you what his name is. ﻿Didn't you go to school? ﻿No, we stayed in the hospital with Mom. ﻿What's going on? -Amber Alert. ﻿He's in the house with the daughter of... ﻿Didn't he run away? ﻿Go inside, okay? ﻿Go inside, Tomer. ﻿Fahed, don't do anything hasty. ﻿The psychologist will be here soon. ﻿Al Moalem. -I can't believe this... ﻿I speaking Arabic... ﻿How are you? Everything okay? ﻿Stay away from me. ﻿Let me hug you. -No. ﻿Let me hug you. -No! I don't want you near me. ﻿Fahed, Fahed. ﻿The psychologist will be here in five minutes. ﻿I'm fed up with you. I can't take it anymore. ﻿Yael... ﻿Besides this morning with you, ﻿I have been perfect. -Perfect? ﻿Then what's with this Amber Alert in our yard? ﻿Everything is okay. ﻿Come. Come after me. ﻿Five minutes... ﻿And all this will be history. ﻿Five minutes. ﻿Because I love ﻿Oh,... ﻿Five minutes. ﻿Where are you going, Tali? ﻿Five minutes. ﻿Fahed, open up. ﻿Halt, Tali. -It's alright. ﻿We have to wait for the psychologist in any case. ﻿Tali, Tali, don't go in there. ﻿Five minutes and all this is history. Open up! ﻿Don't go in, he'll come out by himself. Tali! ﻿Give me a hug. -She won't say who did it. ﻿Give me a hug, man. ﻿Let's see. ﻿(Psychologist speaking in Arabic to Fahed) ﻿Yaara, this is Naftali. Naftali, Yaara. ﻿Yaara, they're outside carrying guns. You have to say who did it, now! ﻿Give me a minute. ﻿Stand up, Yaara. ﻿Stand up! ﻿Why are you shouting? -I don't have the time. ﻿Yaara, ﻿this is your body and only yours. From birth. ﻿Nobody can take it from you, because nobody can give it to you either. It's yours. ﻿And whatever happened is his fault alone. Now tell me who did it. ﻿Naftali, it's me, peak up. ﻿What are you waiting for? Move in! ﻿We'll go out... And well tell them the truth. ﻿Naftali, why aren't you answering me? ﻿It's Paritzky, isn't it? ﻿It's not Paritzky. ﻿Guys don't shoot. It's from the shooting range. ﻿Then who is it? ﻿Who else works in Paritzky's yard? ﻿Guys, don't get near. It's dangerous. ﻿Who else works there? ﻿Yaara, who else works there? -I'm scared. ﻿Sure you're afraid. So is Fahed. So am I. ﻿But we have no choice. -Tell them it's not Fahed ﻿Naftali, I give you 30 seconds... Come out or we get in. We're braking in. ﻿That's not enough. ﻿What about you? ﻿Halt! ﻿Fahed is coming out in a second. ﻿Stop this, Tali, it's dangerous. ﻿Friends, lower your weapons. ﻿Halt! ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿I'll tell him to come out. Fahed... ﻿come out. ﻿Come here. ﻿Guys... ﻿Go! ﻿Get off of him. ﻿The motorcyclist, the guy who left Paritzky's yesterday at 7 in the morning, ﻿He assaulted Yaara, not Fahed. ﻿Let's figure out who that is. ﻿What's with the demonstration? Stop shout... ﻿What are you doing? Are you crazy? ﻿Give him back his phone! ﻿Return the phone to Fahed right now! ﻿Return it and apologize. ﻿Go on. ﻿Who could this be? ﻿Let's think all together. ﻿Who could this guy be? ﻿The motorcyclist who left Paritzky's yard, yesterday before 7 am. ﻿Does anybody know? ﻿Are you with me, dude? Do you know him? ﻿Do you know, ma'am? -No. ﻿Guys, let's talk now and not cling our tongues later. ﻿You're Paritzky's neighbor! You don't know. ﻿So nobody knows who is... ﻿What's that? Did I hear something? ﻿What's that I heard? Who said something? ﻿Someone here said it's his nephew. ﻿Paritzky's nephew. ﻿Covering up for your nephew, huh? What's his name? ﻿We should know this already. ﻿Does anybody know his name? His nephew's name? ﻿What's Paritzky's nephew's name? ﻿Nathan. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Good morning. ﻿What's cooking? ﻿Are you Naftali? ﻿And you're his wife? You were in the hospital today? ﻿It's a misunderstanding, listen,.. ﻿Ma'am, there's no misunderstanding here. ﻿This is our job. ﻿You're on private property. ﻿This is private property. -Oh, private property, huh? ﻿And the gun? ﻿So if it's private property you're allowed to shoot? - ﻿The gun... -Whoa! Put that down! ﻿-Give me that. ﻿He stole my gun. ﻿He did this, too. This man, ﻿not only did he cover up his nephew molesting young girls, ﻿he even tried to frame someone else. Shame on you! Disgusting! ﻿Come on! ﻿From now on, speak up! Don't just cling your tongues! ﻿What did you tell them in hospital? ﻿The truth, that you pushed her. -He didn't push her... ﻿Excuse me, excuse me... -He didn't push her. ﻿Ma'am we've seen this before. Obviously you'd say so when he's around. ﻿The second we turn around you'll need seven more stitches. ﻿Where's Fahed? ﻿Fahed? -Fahed? ﻿Fahed just left. He got hurt, poor guy. ﻿I'm Sayeed, his brother. -Sayeed, nice to meet you. ﻿How's the baby? -Better, God willing. ﻿What's with the small talk? ﻿Just a second. This is the house, go on in and look around, ﻿I'll be right there. -Get your ass in the police car! ﻿And don't give me any "private property" crap. ﻿Don't give me that crap... ﻿Dad, let's go upstairs, they'll never notice. -Yes, they'll never notice. ﻿Hug... Daddy... ﻿At least let us say goodbye... ﻿Bye, dad. Be strong. ﻿Daddy... Wait...
