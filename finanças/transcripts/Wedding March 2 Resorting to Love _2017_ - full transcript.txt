Hey mom. Hi, sweetie. You excited? Yes, I am. A little nervous. I never thought we'd be staging our house. Yeah, I know, right? You ok? Yeah. It's just... are you sure about all of this? You know I think Mick is amazing, but these are huge changes you're talking about. Plus, you're a type A, and I'm pretty sure he's a type B. Or C. ( chuckles ) Aren't you the one who told me to jump in? I meant put a toe in. Test the waters. Not put your house up for sale and give away your business. Honey, this house is way too big for me now and I'm giving my business to you, ok? I'm ready for a new chapter. Is he? I'll see when I get there. So you haven't told him everything. I will though, in person. Mom. Honey, everything is gonna be great. I promise. I know. I'm just really gonna miss you. Awe, I'm gonna miss you, too. Hey. Let's get this thing staged. Ok. I think we should move the couch to face the window. Oh. I was- I was thinking opposite. We reverse it, put the couch there, love seat there, coffee table here. Mom? Hmm? You're taking over again. You're right. Couch facing the window it is. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. ( strumming ) You guys about ready to warm up? ( band ): Yeah. Yeah. Alright. You and me, huh? Chorus. Two. Three. And... ♪ it's you and me, ♪ ♪ there is no other way, ♪ ♪ And we're startin' here today, ♪ ♪ 'Cause today ♪ ♪ oh it's just you and me ♪ Whoo! Alright. Feelin' good. Feelin' good. Yes. Last show on the Dive Bar Tour, pal. It's been great. It's been like the old days. Yeah. So, what's the plan? Well, I'm gonna head back to the Inn, fluff up some pillows and hang up the "open" sign. Yeah, I kinda meant with Olivia. Oh, she's in New York. She's just tying up some loose ends. You know, we talk, FaceTime, text almost every day. She's coming to the Inn this weekend. Oh yeah? Yeah. For how long? I don't know. It's open-ended. We're sorta just playing it by ear, pick up where we left off. Right. Why? What? Well, it's jus the last time she was at the Inn you did break up a wedding. Uh, yeah, I remember. Look, Mick, I think you guys are great together, I really do. And I love Olivia, you know that. But have you really thought this thing through? What's there to think through? It's Olivia. We've known each other forever. I'm just saying you've been on your own a long time, pal. But you know what? It's gonna be great. This is our last show, let's kill it. Come on. Ok. ( crowd chanting ) ♪ ♪ I'm gonna drive with Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ride with Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm gonna fly with Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm gonna cry with Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ride with Miss Daisy, ♪ ( wedding march plays ) ( applause ) It's the newest thing. It's called The Matrimony Resort. They have everything we need for the wedding so you don't have to worry about a thing. Somehow I think you might still worry a little. Maybe. A little. But it takes so much off our plate, and I know you want to keep things simple. ( gasps ) Oh, look at them. They're perfect. Is there anything better than a wedding? Uh, the basketball playoffs? At least you didn't say "root canal". I was thinking it. Ha ha. ( giggles ) You know what, though? You know what's even better than a wedding? A marriage. Awe. You're right. It's just a day. The most important day of our lives. ( giggles ) Come on, let's go in. You're going to love this place, I promise. Ok. They have several weddings here a day, so we're gonna have to book in as soon as we can if you like it, which I know you will... Wow. Helene and Wes got married here last month. What, your cousin Helene? Mmmhmm. Didn't that get annulled? Yes, but the wedding was amazing. Cucumber water? Thank you. I love cucumber water. I'm ok, thank you. I had some cucumber in my salad last night. Ok. I know it's big. It's bigger than we talked about but it gives us more options. And just wait until you see the wedding pavilion. And the ballroom. And the ballroom. Hey, everybody. It's almost summer. We're open for business. ( quacking ) Got any friends getting married? Ok, stale breadcrumbs on the way. Talking to the ducks again? Julie! Hey! I thought I was picking you up at the train. I caught a ride. My final ended early and yes I aced it. I'm so proud of you, honey. Thanks, dad. Likewise, how was the end of the tour? Oh, it was uh... it was good, good. I uh, got you a t-shirt. I'm not wearing a t-shirt with my dad's picture. Yeah, I guess that would be kind of embarrassing, huh? Kinda. I'll get your bags. Someone's bringing them, actually. The word is "boyfriend". Mr. Turner. I've heard so much about you. Dad, this is Wyatt. He's a hospitality major at State. Isn't that great? Yeah. I'm still stuck on the word "boyfriend". This place is fantastic. Seeing as the season's starting up I was hoping you could give Wyatt a summer job at the Inn. I'm happy to start at the bottom. I'll do anything. Or nothing. Or everything? Well, that's very nice of you but uh, unfortunately we're in a bit of a hiring freeze right now. You may wanna try the place down the road. The place we passed on the way in? Yeah. Otherwise known as "the Inn killer". If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Turner, are you open all year? No. Just the summer. Memorial Day through Labour Day. It never changes. You know, statistically establishments that stay open through the off season show a better OPR. OPR? Occupancy to profit ratio. Isn't he amazing? Amazing. I'll let my board of directors know. I'll get the stuff from the car. What is this? Dad, dad. Please. Listen, there's... there's something I gotta talk to you about. I didn't wanna bother you with it at school, but uh, we're in a little slump around here. I know summer bookings are down but it'll pick up. We're almost in June. That other place is syphoning all the business. It's just one place. How many weddings can they put on? How about all of them? So I, uh, I've been talking to a broker. You're selling the Inn? No, I'm looking for an investor and someone's made an offer. An investor? Yeah. It would be more like a partner, I guess. A silent partner. How silent? Well, they would put up the money and I'd still run the place like I always do. Well, who is it? I don't know yet. We're gonna meet and see if it's a fit. That's great. I guess. It's just... you've been running this place a long time and you do kind of like to have things your way. Yes, I do. And I still will. And Wyatt, let me show you one of my statistically unoccupied rooms. Thanks, Mr. Turner. Where are you gonna put him, dad? As far away from your room as possible. It's not in the lake, is it? Not yet. ( phone rings ) Hey. I was just gonna call you. Oh, good timing. Yeah. How was the last show? Uh, good, good. Good crowd. Good. Good to hear. How's everything going with you um... uh, getting packed with the house and everything? Yeah, I- I'm all packed up. Good. Well, I can't wait to see you. Yeah, me too. Um, hey, there's just something I wanna mention. Ok. Uh... how's the weather? Nice. It's... good. Ok then, I'll see you tomorrow. Okey dokey. ( sighs ) How's the weather? Okey dokey? Hey, dad. Where is he? That's the first thing you have to say? Hi, honey. Where is he? He's outside fixing the bikes. What is this? Are you planning some romantic dinner? Yes, for you and Olivia. Oh, honey, you don't have to- We need to go all out. You haven't seen her in two months. Actually it's five weeks and three days. She came to the Rooster Shack show in Newark. Ok. That's dedication. You think? Yeah. And I'm cooking. What's her favourite dish? Uh... pizza. And that was, what, in college? I don't know, call it Italian food. She could have gone gluten free or be a vegetarian for all I know. I know she's allergic to roses. You're nervous. That is so cute. I'm not nervous. I am nervous, aren't I? I'm completely nervous. Look at me. I'm a mess. Change is good, right? That's what you always tell me. I have no idea what I tell you. Leave it to me. Romantic reunions are my speciality. Ok. Ok. You have choir practise in the garage. Your students are waiting for you. Oh, right. Thanks. Yeah. Which way is the garage? Just... keep walking. ( chatting ) Hey, hey! Missed you guys! Hey! Hi! Hey, how're we doing? Group hug. I got something for ya from the road, guys. Tour t-shirts. ( All): Wow. Right? My aunt saw you play last week. Oh, that's right- she got up on stage and danced. She was really good, too. ( laughs ) You tell her she gets a backstage pass next time, ok? You guys been, uh, practising while I've been gone? ( All ): Yes! Does singing in the shower count? Absolutely, it counts. ( laughing ) You got the new sheet music? A love song? Well, I hope somebody loves it. Looks like a love song to me. For Olivia? I think we're getting a little sidetracked, here. He's changing the subject. Is this a therapy session for me or is this choir rehearsal? Both. Sit down. Here we go. Let's warm up. ( strums ) Two, three, and... ( sing vocal scales ) Nice. ( strums ) ( distant singing ) ♪ Oh, I'm gonna drive Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ Uh, oh! ♪ ♪ I'm gonna ride with Miss Daisy, ♪ ♪ Uh, oh! ♪ ♪ I'm gonna fly with Miss- ♪ Hi. I guess the tour isn't over. Olivia! ( laughs ) You're early. I- I could come back for the late show. How long have you been standing there? Air guitar and spin. ( laughs ) No, no, no. Wait a minute. It's uh... it's wet. Thank you. Wow. So chivalrous. ( laughs ) Hi. Hi. You're here. Yeah. I'm here. How was the drive? It was good. Yeah, it was good. Easy. Yeah. You look really good. Oh, thanks. Better than on FaceTime? Yeah. Much. You too. And here I thought this was gonna feel awkward. Yeah, well, it still might be. There's something that I haven't told you. Oh. Something other than you're selling your house and you're giving your business to your daughter? Something other than that? Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Just a little. Oh, ok. Well, maybe we should go down by the lake in case I need to jump in. ( laughs ) Good idea. The thing is my being here is a really big step, you know, for both of us. Yeah, of course it is. And I'm good with it. Good. 'Cause... I wanna help you turn this place into the best wedding resort in Vermont. Oh. Well, that's nice. What does that mean, exactly? It means I wanna help you run this place. Oh. So you don't wanna just live here, you wanna work together? Yeah. Well, to quote a popular phrase around here, I do. It might be a little complicated, you see. I'm about ready to take on a partner. I know. What? I was looking for places to rent around here and your broker told me that you were, um, in a bit of a situation. Ok, this has just gotten incredibly awkward. Mick, when you were on the road I had a lot of time to think and I realized that it would be crazy for me to jump head first into a new relationship. I mean, I was just engaged and you've been single for a long time. So you wanna be business partners? Besides, it'll give us a chance to really get to know each other again. Just take it slow, right? Yeah. Yeah, slow is great. Good. I was thinking I could move into the carriage house. I know it needs a lot of work but fixing things up is what I'm good at. You really have thought this through. Yeah, and it's gonna be amazing. I know it. We're shaking hands now? If it's ok I'd like to go check out the carriage house. Mmm. Was that Olivia? You ok? Yeah, it's just not the romantic reunion I had planned. She's not staying? Oh yeah, she's staying. ( blows ) I liked the candles. Well, that's for the romance package, partner. Ok. Well, I do get to eat, don't I? Just this once. Ok, chicken cacciatore for two à la Julie. Wow, looks amazing. You might just have to replace Duke in the kitchen. No one can grill cheese like Duke. Oh, that's true. Remember when he poisoned the entire dorm room floor? Spoiled cheddar incident? Well, you'll be eating a lot of my cooking because we're here for the whole summer. We? Wyatt and I. That's still not decided on. Dad. Hello. Hi. Olivia, this is my boyfriend, Wyatt. Ugh. Hi, Olivia. Uh, Mick's business partner. Nice to meet you. You, too. Would you like some wine? Oh, yes please. Thank you. Enjoy. Ok. Seems like a nice kid. I'm still vetting him. Vetting him? He's overly polite and helpful. And he was holding my daughter's hand earlier. Oh, call homeland security. It's not easy having a daughter. I know. Who names their kid "Wyatt"? There's Wyatt Earp. Yeah, a gunslinger. I'm pretty sure he was a Marshall. Potato tomato. So how are reservations? Do we have any weddings booked? We have a few reservations here and there and... the weddings we had booked have been cancelled 'cause the new place opened. When was the last time this place was fixed up? Well, it's been a while. Since your almost wedding. So I'm not saying that we need all new furniture. Just slip covers, maybe some throw pillows, a couple coats of paint here. Like, get rid of the wallpaper- I was actually looking for more of a silent partner. Re-do all of the drapery, for sure. I think I'm gonna go get that bottle of wine. I kinda like the floors, though, I have to admit that. Those flowers are bugging me. ( laughs ) ( laughs ) You're doing really great. Olivia is super nice. Olivia really likes you, it'll be great. Excuse me. I don't think he likes me much. It's not you. He thinks I'm still his little girl. And he probably will until I'm 60. Plus, you're the first guy I've brought home and I didn't tell him I was bringing you. Talk about stacking the cards against me. You'll win him over. Besides, he won't be focusing on you. He's too busy hiding his feelings from Olivia. I thought you said they were a thing. They are. Promise me we'll never get weird like that. I promise. Your dad's not coming back in, is he? Better make it quick. ( sighs ) ( sighs ) I just need to move that credenza. ( knocking ) Oh, room service? For our valued guests. Well, thank you. Thank you. How are you this morning? I couldn't sleep last night. Neither could I. I'm just so excited. Yeah. Me too. Hey, I was thinking that we could go check out that new place down the road today. I see it every day when I have to drive by it. Well, I haven't seen it yet. Wow. Six weddings in one day? Who gets married on a Thursday? It's Saturday. Who gets married on a Saturday? The Masons and LaMars, Wilsons and Walkers- Why don't they just have an assembly line of brides and grooms or just one big group wedding and get it all done at once? I'm just going to take... Thank you. They have a spa. We have a fire pit. And an infinity pool. We have a lake. With ducks. Hello. Hi. Can I help you? Yes, we are interested in your wedding packages. Congratulations. Thank you. Hey, you're... you're Mick Turner, right? You own the Willow Lake Inn. Right. And you guys wanna get married here? We do. It's- it's a ways down the road, though. A long and winding road. Well, it's never too early to start planning ahead. We're actually booking into the fall right now. Wow. For what year? Why don't you take a look at our nuptial options. I'm with some clients right now so have a look around. Ok, thank you. You're welcome. Nuptial options? Nup-ops? Stop it. Let's go sit down. Hey, Mick. Oh, hey, Brent. Uh, I think you can lose the hat and glasses now. So... have we come to a final decision? I think we have. We're going with the platinum package. Honey, what do you think? We can't do any better than that. What's the difference between the platinum and the silver package? The platinum is our ultimate experience. Silver doesn't have the personal ice sculptures or the filet mignon Chilean sea bass option. Or the Tiffany wedding favours. The gold package is a very nice compromise. There's a spa day for wedding guests and a complimentary round of golf. What about the basic package? Basic? I'm pretty sure it means normal. Do you really wanna look back and think that our wedding was basic? Why can't we just look forward? Because it's the most special day of our lives. Is something wrong? I am so sorry but there is a problem with your reservation date. Uh, what kind of problem? It would appear that we are double booked and unfortunately our computer gave your date to another couple. A computer gave away our wedding date? I can put you on the wait list. Uh... maybe something will come up before the September date- A wait list? We were supposed to have a June wedding. Everyone's already RSVP'd. I am so very, very sorry, and we will of course give you a full refund on your deposit. I'll leave you two alone and you can decide what to do. Honey, uh... maybe this is fate? ( crying ) So you don't wanna marry me?! No, no, no, no. Of course I do. Just... not here. You know what? Let's... let's forget all this and we'll uh, we'll elope. ( sobbing ) Thank you. I couldn't help but overhear. I'm so sorry. I can't believe this. I... what am I gonna tell everyone? I just... ( sniffles ) I just wanted everything to be perfect just for this one day. Oh, I understand. And it should. Have you ever heard of Willow Lake Inn? ( sniffles ) No. It's beautiful. Yeah. That's... that's gorgeous. Well, I think so, too. We think so. Oh! Oh my gosh! It's Mick Turner! Chris, it's Mick Turner! I loved your music when I was a kid. Yeah, same here. Thank you. My mom played it all the time. Oh yeah. I'm big with the moms. Well... maybe we should... go see it? Yeah. It's up Route One a couple miles, you can't miss it. Ok. Well, we'll see you. So you're a wedding poacher now? I think I'm going to need my name on the business cards. It's so rustic and charming. Rustic and charm are our speciality. Right. You know, we started off picturing something like this, but I got a little swept up. A little? ( laughs ) Corrine's been planning her wedding since she was eight. No way! Seven. I put a sheet on my head and pretended it was a veil. ( laughs ) That's really cute. How did you guys meet? Chris is a landscape artist. A landscaper. She likes to add that "artiste" part. She's an editor. I work with a publishing house in the city. I left work early one day, which is something I never do, and I took a walk in the park. And he was there, planting trees in jeans and a dirt covered shirt. He was totally different from the suit and tie guys I had been dating. And that was it. And when I looked at her I said "that's the girl I'm gonna marry". Awe. I'm so lucky. No, I'm the lucky one. You guys are so cute. Aren't they? Cute. Are you two married? ( together ) No. But you're a couple, right? Workplace romances are frowned upon around here. Sort of like the ebb and flow of the ocean. Right now we're ebbing. Would you guys like to see the gazebo? Oh! This way. It's perfect. A small, intimate wedding by the lake. I can absolutely see us here. Me too. Then it's settled. We'd love to have our wedding here. That's wonderful! Do you have anything available in June? We sure do. Any day between June 1st and June 30th right now. We'd like to keep our date. June 3rd? June 3rd it is. That's in, like, two weeks. I know it's soon, but everything's already been planned. All we have to do is change the address and a few details. You don't have the platinum package here, right? Never heard of it. Oh, this is so exciting! And we've made a decision. We want you to be our wedding singer. Oh, that's nice, but I- If you'll do us the honour. I don't really- Of course he will. You're right. This is fate. Aww. I'm so happy for you. I'm so excited! Ok. Here's my look book. Wow. I'm still on the fence about one or two things but it's all in there. ( squeals ) This is going to be great! I'll text you. Great. We'll see you on the second. Can't wait! Awe, they are so cute. Mmm. Look book? ( honks horn ) Look at this thing. It's like an encyclopedia. No, it's not. You do know that one wedding isn't gonna save this place. One leads to the next. Especially if it's the best wedding ever. So... this is this how it's gonna be, huh? Pretty much. ♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪ ♪ Oh, Woah yeah, ♪ ♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪ ♪ ♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪ ♪ Woah, ♪ ♪ Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, ♪ ♪ Woah, Woah, Woah, ♪ ♪ Sha-na-na-na-na ♪ Alright, let's take a quick break. Oh, hi. Countdown to "I do", six days. Ok. How are we doing on the flowers? Got the flowers, cake, place settings, gift baskets... I can't believe we did all this in a week. It's only been a week? We've done a lot of weddings over the years but it's always been a little disorganized. You know my dad, he's more of a musician than a wedding planner. I'm just really glad you're here. Awe, thank you. So am I. And so is he. He's just sometimes better with lyrics than actual words. ( laughs ) I- I get it. I get it. Me too, I- I guess. I'm just saying, if you need anyone to talk to about anything... Oh, well thank you, but I think we should probably focus on the ETA of the bouquet. Bouquet. Ok. And Corrine's texted a few times about the rehearsal dinner. A few? I think I've gotten, like, twenty already. That's all?

( clapping ) You guys are sounding good today. Well, I got a little bit of news for you before I let you go. I have a gig. And the better news is you guys are singing with me. We're going on tour? No, we're not going on tour, we're going to the backyard to the gazebo. ( laughing ) We got a wedding this weekend to sing in Sunday and I've already cleared it with all your parents. The best part is there's gonna be free food. What kind of food? Uh, chicken, fish, pasta, I don't know. The bride can't make her mind up about anything, but there's for sure gonna be cake. ( laughing ) So I want you guys to continue to work on the song "Someone is You", that's what we're gonna be singing. Ally I want you to take those ad-lib solos. The rest of us, we're gonna sing the chorus in unis- Mick? Yeah. Can you pick someone else? Why? I just don't want to. Ok, well listen, that's a wrap for today, guys, ok? Great work. See you Sunday. Thanks. Ally, can you stick around for a second? Hey. You know I um... I asked you to do those solos 'cause I think you have such a great voice. Thank you. But I just can't. I'll freeze. Oh, I got ya. The first time I had to sing alone I almost fainted. But then I went on stage anyway and you know, when I started to sing, all that fear just disappeared in the music. When was that? My seventh grade assembly. ( laughs ) You know, the truth is... I still get nervous. Before all these shows I just had, I was nervous before every one of them. Really? Yeah. And you know what? It's ok. And you got a few days, so just think about it, alright? Alright. What did she do to my office? What happened to my office? I was gonna ask you the same thing. It's disgusting in there, Mick. Oh. Well, maybe I let things slide after Julie moved away to college. Hmm. So, what do you think? It's different. And? I thought you gave up the whole staging thing. I can move it back. No, no, no. It's nice. Maybe I'm just used to seeing it the other way. Yeah, probably. I heard your choir today. Oh, you did? Yeah, they sounded great. Thanks. One of the girls has stage fright. Awe. Well, maybe you can tell her how you overcame your fear of staging. I'm not sure that I had but thanks for the tip. You're welcome. Look how much better that looks. I don't see it. ( message alert ) Oh, it's Corrine. They are on their way. What? They were supposed to come up this weekend with everyone else. No, they decided to come a few days early. Oh, no, no, no, this is a big red flag. You know, she's an editor. Editors change their minds over and over again. They're never satisfied. And you know this how? Well, we did the wedding for the editor of the Vermont Maple Newsletter. Oh. Never heard of 'em. Well, people around here have and she was very picky. Well, Corrine edits children's books. That's even worse. She'll be all about fairy tales and happy endings now. This could be a nightmare. Oh, wow. The chairs look great like that. Thank you. You're the future of the hotel industry. What do you think? I think that if the quality of service is as good as this place is than your guests could sit on wood stumps. ( laughs ) I like that. 'Cause I got a lot of wood stumps out back. You don't have to side with my dad. I don't? No. Oh. Well in that case I like it where it is. What do you know? You live in a dorm. Actually he lives in an off-campus apartment. Not helping. He is really warming up to me. I told you he would. By the end of the summer you'll be best buds. I'm just hoping I'm still alive. Oh you'll be alive, just living in the next town. Great. ( honks horn ) We're here! You made it. I can't tell you how excited we are. Oh. And thanks for letting us come up early. Oh, of course. No problem. Did you get my text about the extra names? I did. Wait, what extra names? My dad wanted to add a few extra business clients. I thought we said only close friends and family. It's just a couple more, you won't even notice, I promise. I've just had so many last minute ideas. Oh, wow. Here, let me help you with that. I think that's everything. And I know we've already agreed on the cake but I'm hoping you haven't ordered it yet, have you? Well actually, I have- Because I'm re-thinking the colour palate and we need to talk about designing the logo. Logo? Don't you love it? Yes. It came to me on the drive up. A couple's logo. Napkins and place settings. I love it. What colours are you thinking? You ok? Yeah. Yeah. She just gets swept up. It's weddings. I see it a lot. Me too, at the last two venues. What? Oh, her family's really into weddings. Her sister had this giant production. Her parents vow renewals were just as big. You know, between you and me I can't believe we finally have a place and a date. Well, as long as the place is here and the date is this Sunday. Yeah. She loves the Inn. She just- She's a bride. You might wanna add the word "zilla" to that one. ( laughs ) Well, it looks like you poached the wrong egg, partner. Oh, calm down. It's just wedding jitters. A wedding she's apparently been planning her entire life. I mean, she's changed the menu, she's changed the flowers... a couple's logo? Who has a couple's logo? The Inn doesn't even have a logo. I was thinking we should have a logo. Well, you can put that on my to-do list. I don't know how the bakery is gonna feel about re-designing this cake, either. Hey, we can handle one bride. It'll be a walk in the park. Yeah. Jurassic Park. Grumpy. Oh, wow! Are those all the new cakes? Yes. Yeah. We've got vanilla bundt cake, angel food with raspberry cream, and last but not least, red velvet. Mmm. They all look so good. I don't know which to try first. And, by the way, I love all your ideas. Your signature cocktail is brilliant. Oh, good! Hey, where- where's Chris? Oh, he's opting out of cake tasting. If it were up to him we'd have a bag of doughnuts. ( laughs ) I like doughnuts. Me too, but not for a wedding. Sit, you two. Dig in. You can help me decide. Ok. If you insist. I can't believe this is finally happening. I shouldn't admit this, but I've had a subscription to Bride magazine since I was seventeen. ( laughs ) So no pressure then. No pressure. As long as it's the best day of my entire life. ( laughing ) Ok. I'm the last in my family to get married. My sister's wedding? Amazing. It was on the cover of Weddings Now. There was a pool with lily pads that lit up when she walked by. Wow. Mmmhmm. I could look into that. I could look into floating lights on the lake. Really? Yeah. That'd be amazing. Thank you. Mmm. I love all of these. But... I really want something unforgettable. Ok, unforgettable. Hmm. What about... I don't know, just a big giant cupcake tree? Good idea but one of my bridesmaids already did that at her engagement party. Oh. Ok. I got it. What do you think about personalized cakes so each guest gets their own small cake? Personalized cakes? Yeah. Oh, I love it! Ok, so 26 small cakes. 26- Actually, it's 32 now. And, ugh, possibly 33 if Uncle Ted brings a plus one. We're gonna need to call the bakery. You know what? Better make it 34. Yep. Just to be safe. And we should probably lock down the ring bearer situation. My sister's ring bearer was her French bulldog. It was definitely a highlight and unforgettable. Do you have any super cute nieces or nephews? One niece, but she's 16 and just dyed her hair green. That could be unforgettable. Don't worry, we'll figure something out. Thank you. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Thanks for jumping in here at the last minute. Yeah, I'm happy to help. Dare I ask the latest head count? Well, there's at least two as of now. Bride and groom? No, you and me. Leak down here? That's it. Are you sure you don't wanna call a plumber? You remember what happened at the Melman wedding? I think I can handle one leak. Alright. Well maybe when you're done with that you can handle this. It's from Olivia. Is that another to-do list? Yeah. Read it. Uh, tivoli lights, votive candles, candles, aroma candles, citronella candles... What, are we opening a wax museum here? I know this isn't really how you imagined things going with her but maybe this really is all for the best. I mean, you guys are getting to know each other again. No, this wasn't the plan. Me running errands and working 24/7 together. Well, at least you have a plan now. Or a list, anyway. I can still fire you. Alright. You're the boss. Technically Olivia's actually the boss now... I heard that! I think you should do it. Really? Mmmhmm. Oh, there's our happy couple. Oh! I'm so glad you're here. We need a second opinion. Cummerbund or no cummerbund? Oh, I've never been a fan of the 'bund. Ditto that. Ok. No cummerbund. But you look so handsome. And when am I ever gonna get to see you in a a tux again? And don't say Halloween. What do you think? Tux or suit? Me? Mmmhmm. Oh, I'm probably not the right person to ask about this. I... I suggest be yourself. That way when you look back on these wedding pictures years from now you won't see two strangers. Thank you. Sorry, looks like the tux is out. ( message alert ) Ooh. Olivia's locked down the new flowers. And wait until you see the cakes she's come up with. Cakes? Mmmhmm. As in more than one? A lot more. Every idea I have, she turns it into something better. She's amazing. Of course, you already know that. So we're done here, right? Almost. I just want to check out a couple more bowties. It'll be just a sec. Hey, Mick. You're a musician. Been married a lot, right? No, no. Just once. Oh. You know, I always thought we'd go with a justice of the peace. Tie a couple tin cans to the back of the old car and head off into the sunset. Well, we have great sunsets and we have tin cans. I'm just not sure where Olivia moved the recycling bins. I'm guessing you're going through a little something yourself? I guess you could say that. Guess we've all got our issues, huh? But yours are gonna end Sunday. One can only hope. ( laughs ) Look at these. What do you think? Uh... they're, uh... colourful. I'm leaning to this one or this one. Yeah, um... Ok, I'm gonna go turn the power back on. Be careful. Don't worry, I will. Hey! Looking good. Yeah. Olivia, do you think you could talk to my dad about cutting Wyatt some slack? He's so overprotective. Especially since I went off to school. Honey, it's just a parent thing. Trust me. So... you'll talk to him? Of course, but I doubt he'll listen to me. I wouldn't be so sure about that. Can I... tell you something? Well, yeah honey, anything. I really like Wyatt. I think I might even love him. Oh. Is it your first love? Yeah. Don't tell my dad. I won't. Ok. Do you remember your first love? Yeah, well, sometimes I wish I didn't. My dad? Yeah. I always heard you never get over your first love. Is that true? I'll take that as a yes. Julie! I'm gonna go check on Wyatt. ( speakers turn on ) ( romantic music plays ) They're playing our song. I thought our song was "The Long and Winding Road". Care to check out the dance floor? It's job-related. ♪ Wow. You're pretty good. Do you remember the first time we danced slow? Yeah, it was in the laundry room, with the doors. Do you remember how the flaurescent lights reflected in your hair? Yeah, you? You were out of detergent and asked to borrow a quarter. Did not. Yes, you did. Everything ok? I forgot to confirm the personalized ice sculptures. Personal ice sculptures? It's summer. Yeah, they melt in the cup and you drink them. ( sighs ) Why is it starting to feel like the platinum package around here? Uh... would that be so bad? This was supposed to be a small, intimate wedding. Yeah, well now it's gonna be large and less intimate. ( feedback from speakers ) What the...? ( gasps ) Sorry! Sorry. Did you do that on purpose? No. I was momentarily blinded by all of this. This is what the bride wants. Well, until one of you changes your mind. What do you mean "one of us"? It just feels like you're overly involved. No, I'm not. I'm just doing what the bride wants. Well, what if she doesn't know what she wants? What is the groom supposed to do? Stand around and change his tie? What are you saying, exactly? It just- there comes a point, Olivia, where you have to decide how you want things. Well, I guess we haven't reached that point yet, have we? Well, apparently we haven't. You know what? I'm gonna say goodnight. It feels late. Well, you know what they say, never go to bed mad, just stay up and fight. That's for couples! ( drilling ) ( computer ) How can I help you? What is a personal ice sculpture? ( computer ) I don't understand the question. You and me both. Wyatt Earp. Wyatt Earp is famous for the gunfight at the OK corral. Wyatt Earp is also known as a lawman, a saloon keeper, a gambler. What're you doing? Oh, hey. Just uh, Googling. Wyatt Earp? Yeah, I was thinking of writing a country song. Or um, buying a horse. Dad, I really wish you'd stop worrying about my relationship and focus on your own. Unless you wanna be alone with the ducks again. I like the ducks. Because they fly south for the winter? Hey, it's not like I'm not trying, here. She's completely taken over. Even my desk. It's now a partner's desk, and she's moving things and she's staging things- This place needed change, dad. It's silly to get upset about a desk. And do you know how long I've been trying to get you to cover those hideous chairs in the lobby? It's like your music. You can't just keep singing the same old songs, you need to write new ones. Don't do that. Don't use a music analogy. I learned from the master. Look, I know you're used to running this place by yourself but you wanted a partner. Yes, a silent partner and it wasn't supposed to be her. Ok, so it's complicated but it's new and you'll get used to things and, dad, I really think you two make a good team. And there's no "i" in "team", right? A music analogy and a sports analogy? Really? ( sighs ) Ok. I will try to be more hospitable. You are in the hospitality business. Mmmhmm. Welcome to the partnership at Willow Lake Inn. Here. Take Wyatt Earp out to dinner. Thanks, dad. ( honks horn ) Got a delivery, Mick. Thanks, Jerry. It's not for you, it's for Olivia Parsons? Oh, yeah, I'll take it. Wow, you've really made some changes around here. The place has never looked this good. Yeah, a lot of changes. Well, let me know if you're hiring. I could always use a second job. I'll let management know. Could you also get management to approve the new menu? I'll try but management's very busy. Hmm-mmm. You know, this place really has never looked so good. Hey, mom. Hi, honey. Don't worry, the Gordon house is staged and it looks fab. Oh, actually I just called to tell you I miss you. I miss you, too. How's it going? The wedding? No, you and Mick. And the new chapter. Actually, I wouldn't mind skipping this chapter. I knew it. You're taking over the Inn, aren't you? Or the entire state of Vermont? No, I- I'm not. Well, maybe a little. But I- I'm trying not to. Mom, take a step back. Or maybe two. You're right. Ok. I'm... I'm stepping. ( knocking ) Oh, hey honey, I gotta go. Tell him I say hi! I will. I love you. Love you. Mwah. Delivery. Oh. Thank you. Personalized sculptures? You don't even wanna ask. I want to apologize. Me too. I think I kinda dropped you on purpose on the dance floor. I think I kinda have been over-involved. The truth is I think you're doing a really good job. Really? Yeah. I'm just having a little trouble getting used to working for you- I mean with you. ( laughs ) Well, if you ever wanna jump in on the nup-ops feel free to say "I do". ( laughs ) That's ok. Are you sure? I'm sure. Come on. Where are we going? Are you sure we should be doing this? I think we're allowed to take an hour to ourselves. What if they need us? I'm sure they can fend for themselves. And if Corrine needs us she'll find us. Yeah, well I just hope she makes it through this wedding. I hope we make it through this wedding. Have I told you lately how smart and mature Julie is? Thanks. Yeah, she is a great judge of character. Ok, did she put you up to this? No. They're too young to be so serious. Awe, they're the same age we were when we met. And look how we turned out. We're here together now, aren't we? That we are. So I got an offer on my house. Already? Yeah. Congratulations. Are you gonna take it? I'm not sure. Hmm. Do you think I made a mistake by coming here? Let's just say it hasn't gone as I'd planned but whatever does go as planned? Yeah, well, I guess we can decide after the rice is thrown on Sunday. Unless, of course, the bride changes the rice to kale chips. ( laughs ) Woo. Four skips. Oooh, five. No, it wasn't. That was five. That was not five. Then you can't count. Alright, I'll make you a little bet. Name it. Ok. If I win you move those chairs back to where they were in front of the fireplace. Oh, ok. And if I win you have to ease up on Wyatt. Really? Yes. Alright, you're on. You go first. Ok. Oh, nice. Beat that. This is nice. Just doing nothing. I'm gonna put this here just in case any wedding stuff. I'm watching you. ( giggles ) I know I've gotten a little out of hand. Uh huh. It's just that this is ( together ) the most important day of our lives. ( laughing ) ( message alert ) Oh. It's my sister. She wants to know if she should bring her confetti gun for the post-nuptials. Mmm, tell her "no". But thanks for thinking of us. You're right. Unnecessary. Oh, look! Someone's getting their wedding photographs taken. Let's go see. Corrine. But this isn't our wedding, it's somebody else's. Isn't anyone single in this town? Honey, please, can we just sit and finish our coffee? Awe, look at her veil. I love that. They're like two people on top of a cake. You mean the two plastic figurines? You know what I mean. I'm afraid I do. Tell me that cummerbund doesn't look great. Uh huh. Yeah. Mmmhmm. It's perfect. You love it. I love it. ( laughs ) You're a genius. No, you are. Let's just say we both are. What's going on? ...guys? What's going on, guys? For Chris and Corrine. It's their couple's logo. You did this? It was mostly Wyatt. It's good. Thanks, Mr. Turner. We're gonna print it on the napkins and centrepieces. You may wanna run that by the bride and groom. Check that, the bride. Oh, I already did. She loves it. Really? Mmmhmm. I've also been working on a logo for the Inn. I assume management ok'd this? Yep. It's just a rough sketch, but... What's this? Uh... Ju- Julie and Wyatt. It's our couple's logo. Yeah, I'm gonna put a stop to that. Dad. No go with the logo. You guys just met. We met, like, half a semester ago. What is that, like three weeks? Eight weeks. And four days. Maybe your dad's right. We really haven't been dating that long. Thank you, Wyatt. Ok, we'll save it for later. Like our six month anniversary. Don't push it, kid. And I want a re-match. And next time I pick the stones. Hard to explain. Wow, nice. Look at the lake. Oh my goodness. See you inside. Bye. ( gasps ) Hi! ( clamouring ) Hi! You look so beautiful. Thanks. There's our bride. Hi, dad! Hello. Hi. This is just so exciting. I know, isn't this exciting? And isn't this place great? Oh, it's lovely. Stunning. How was the drive? Oh, your mother talked about weddings the entire way. Well, why wouldn't I? Our girl is getting married. That's 98. What? I'm counting how many times she says that. ( laughs ) Well, I promised this would be an unforgettable wedding and it will be. I have every minute planned. Schedules. Cocktail reception at 4:00, rehearsal at 6:00, dinner at 7:00 followed by the Chinese lantern lighting. And that's just the pre-wedding. I think you may have outdone me. That's impossible. Also true. ( laughs ) I can't imagine what you have planned for Sunday. My lips are sealed. So where's Chris? Getting ready, I think. Wait until you see him. We went shopping. He looks completely transformed. Come on! ( giggling ) There he is. Hey, guys. Chris. Oh. Oh yeah, he's totally transformed... with dirt. Ok, what do you think? Veil or no veil? Veil. It's not too much? No, it's your wedding. It's never too much. Are you sure? That's a little... that's a little... ( laughs ) That's a little much. Remember when we were kids and we used to plan our seating charts and make our menus? Chicken or fish? Tented yard or indoor ballroom... Invitations engraved or embossed? And we checked the weather in countries where exotic flowers were from. ( laughs ) Oh, wait. What about sugar cubes? Oh, they had to match the centrepieces. Right? Mmmhmm. I was always your maid of honour. And now I get to be yours. All I want is for you to have the most beautiful wedding ever. You mean the second most beautiful wedding ever. That's true. It's a little bit hard to top mine. We'll see. ( knocking ) Corrine? Oh, I'm trying on my dress. Again? Don't come in! It's bad luck. Haven't I seen that dress already? I returned that one. This is a new dress. I'll be down in a sec. Wait until you see my rehearsal dress. ( jazz music playing ) ♪♪ This is the biggest rehearsal dinner in the history of rehearsal dinners. ♪ ♪ There he is. Oh, Lisa, you look fabulous. Thank you. Almost. You look so good. You too. Dad, you're looking good. You look dapper. Thank you, sir, thank you. Squeeze by here. Signature cocktail? Is it strong? Very. Cheers. Woah, it's got a kick to it. What is it? It's called the Corrine Fizz. Mmm. Of course it is. ( laughs ) Wait until you see the appetizers. You know anything about the appetizers? Let's just hope your suit's fire retardant. I might need you to top me off there. This thing is strangling me. Just hang in there, it won't be long now. There's the bride. There she is. ( clapping ) Wow. What do you think? You look beautiful. And you look very handsome and uncomfortable in that suit. ( laughs ) Look what my mom brought. Oh. What is that? It's something old, and my dress is something new. Now all I need is something borrowed and something blue. Well, we did borrow the money to put on this wedding- Chris... And I'm pretty sure I'm turning blue from this tie. Better? A little. Hmm. Should have gone for the bow tie. Oh, you! You could not have chosen a more perfect place. And you know the saying a June wedding. ( together ) When you're married in June you're a bride all your life. ( giggling ) I have to show you something. My girls are really into their weddings, aren't they? I barely noticed. Yeah. ( laughs ) Yeah, and you look just like me at my wedding. Like a deer in headlights. That obvious? Yeah. But you know, marrying Corrine's mother was the best thing I ever did. And you did it twice. Yeah, well that- that vow renewal thing, that wasn't my idea. Gotta go with the flow, right? ( clinks glass ) Appetizers, everyone. ( crowd gasps ) Hey, Mick. Hey. First wedding here in a while, huh? Yeah, hopefully not the last. You know, they are keeping me so busy at that new place down the road. Don't remind me. Then I won't remind you that I've gotta be back there in about an hour for another rehearsal. I'll have you out of here in 30 minutes. Right before the Chinese lantern ceremony. Oh, you know, I saw one of those at the new place last week. Really nice. Wow, this is a lot of people for a rehearsal. How are you? Oh, good, how are you? Why don't you go ahead and sit down there? Ladies, you can sit down here. Ok. Thanks. Hi guys, the rehearsal is about to get started. Ok, here we go. ( gentle guitar music ) Everyone please be seated. Chris, not you. Corrine and Chris, tomorrow it will be my honour to unite you as man and wife. I'll save my blessings until then, following which the choir will sing a beautiful song, the bride's sister will read a poem. We'll reserve the release of the doves until tomorrow. Doves? They're romantic. And good luck. And I believe we have a rather unique ring bearer. ( drone buzzing ) Is that... our rings on a drone? Unforgettable, right? ( crowd gasps ) ( crash ) Oh no. Ok, oh my goodness. Don't worry, everyone. Everything is gonna be ok. We'll find them. Hey, are you alright? Maybe this is fate. Actually I think it's more of a mechanical difficulty. What if it's not, Mick? What if this is my future now? Doves and lanterns and drones, are you kidding me?! Let's not lose sight of something. You love her, you know. She's the one. These things are gonna happen, you know. You want things, she wants things, and you compromise. I'm guessing you walked away. Actually I drove away on a tour bus, so it's... But you left because you knew Olivia wasn't right for you. No, actually she was right for me, I just- So why aren't you together now? Well, it's complicated. You like being single. You can do whatever you want. You can go on the road- No. No, no. That's not what I'm saying here- You're free. Hey, Mick, thank you. I really needed this talk. Hey, Chris! I found them! I found them! ( applause ) Hey. What is it? What's wrong? Corrine, I have been trying to go along with all these plans and packages but this wedding has become more important to you than our marriage. This isn't us. At least... it's not me. And I don't know how I can go through with our marriage when I'm pretty sure you want somebody else to be your groom. What? I'm sorry. I uh... I can't do this. ( door closes ) ( sniffling ) I ruined everything and now he's gone. I'm so sorry, honey. Me too. It's like we all got swept up in this fantasy. I stopped listening to him. I lost sight of who we are. Who we were. You know, I never told you this before but Aaron almost broke up with me over our wedding. He did? Yeah. I never told you because I wanted you to think everything was perfect. It was far from perfect. The only thing perfect about it was that we ended up together. And I practically forced your father into that vow renewal. At least dad didn't walk out on you. Well, he might have if we weren't already married. The point is, is that there's no such thing as a perfect wedding. And there's no such thing as a perfect couple. But as long as you love him then who cares, right? You do love him, don't you? I really do. What did you say to him? Nothing, really. Well, he left after you guys talked. He asked about us and I gave him a little background information. Oh, great. It was meant as a cautionary tale. Well, you drove him off. Well, I might have misspoken, Olivia, but it was heading in this direction one way or the other. What does that mean? It means that the platinum package is what drove him off and you are an enabler. Oh, what? You helped turn this wedding into a three-ring circus. It's what the bride wanted. What about what the groom wants? The groom could have spoken up! Well, how do you stop a runaway train, Olivia? You jump on the tracks and just let it hit you? Just because I moved a few things around in this place doesn't make me a runaway train. A few things? How about everything? I thought you wanted me here. Yes! I do. As- as my girlfriend, not as a business partner. You are so involved in this wedding I have no idea if there's an "us" anymore. It's not about us. Yeah, well maybe it is. ( clears throat ) Did you hear all that? Yeah. I think everyone heard all that. They got more on their minds than us. What do we do with 36 personal ice sculptures? Let them melt, I guess. ( honks horn ) There goes the bride. Folks, could I have your attention please? Um... I wish we could say we've never had this happen before but... it has. Um... the thing is, love is messy, right? And sometimes the person you're with can seem annoying and infuriating and maybe a little crazy. But sometimes it all works out in the end. Eventually. Uh, in the meantime we have chicken, fish, and pasta followed by personalized cakes for everyone. ( applause ) Chris! What're you doing? Just wait. Please. The first time I saw you, you were planting trees in jeans and a dirty t-shirt and I thought to myself "that's the guy I'm gonna marry". I'm sorry I got so caught up. I don't know why I tried to turn you into someone else because I don't want someone else I want that guy from the park. I want you and me back. Are you sure about that? I'm so sure. I don't care about the cake or the colour palate or the ice sculptures, I just care about spending my life with you. If you'll still have me. Does that mean no more cummerbund? No cummerbund. No signature cocktails, no drones, no couple's logo- Actually, I kinda liked that logo. Excuse me, everybody. We've decided together, after serious consideration, that we're eloping. ( crowd rejoices ) ( laughing ) I'm sorry if I made this worse. Or if I did. You didn't. Actually this is turning out just the way it should have. So what now, Vegas? That's up to Corrine. No, it's up to you. I know a justice of the peace in Atlantic City, he doubles as an Elvis impersonator. Now that's an idea I like. Kidding. ( laughs ) Or you could go back to the original plan and have a nice intimate ceremony in the gazebo tomorrow. We could provide the ducks. We're in. ( squeals ) Yay! I'm so happy. ( laughing ) Anybody heard from Ally? ( All ): No. Am I too late? Right on time. I thought about what you said. If I faint you'll catch me, right? We all will, right? Ok, here we go. Ready?

Corrine and Chris, is there something you would like to say to each other? If, at the end of the day, you're married to the one that you love, then everything went perfectly and I'm so lucky to be marrying the man that I love. Corrine, I love you so much and I've never been happier than I am right now because I get to spend the rest of my life with you, starting with this. Uh, not just yet. ( laughing ) I now pronounce you man and wife and now you may kiss the bride. ( applause ) Ok, nothing like planning a wedding to make you never wanna get married. Ever. Or for at least ten, twenty years. Make it thirty. ( laughs ) That wasn't so bad, was it? And instead of wedding cake we've got something special for you. Oh no. Oh yes. Your favourite. Doughnuts! ( cheering and applause ) Yay! ( laughter and chatting ) Nice! Nice catch. ( laughing ) ( applause ) I'm so happy for you. Well, this truly was unforgettable. Yeah. We couldn't have picked a better place to start our lives together. Yeah. And who knows? Maybe we'll do our vow renewal here. Ha ha. ( laughing ) Well, shall we? Just one sec. See you guys. Thank you. Bye. Good luck. I know I'm clearly not one to give relationship advice seeing as I was almost left at the altar, but it's pretty obvious that there's more going on between you two than just the ebb of the tide. As someone who almost lost everything over nothing, don't let it slip away. ( car honking ) I guess it's never too late for happily ever after. Excuse me. Wyatt, I uh, wanted to thank you for helping out so much. Thank you for letting me help out, Mr. Turner. You can call me Mick. Maybe he'll call you "dad" one day. Kidding. Uh, we're gonna go start the clean up. Thanks, you guys. Hey! This was the most beautiful wedding. ( together ): Thank you. You know, my fiancé and I were looking for a venue for our wedding in November and I think this is it. Great. But we're only open during the summer. Not anymore. Fantastic. November? Yep. And, by the way, you guys are the cutest couple. Should we tell her we're not a couple? No, we wouldn't want to disappoint the bride. Well, we did it, partner. Yeah, we did. Partner. I thought we frowned upon workplace romances. That's right, we do. Yeah, I'm glad we cleared that up. Okey dokey.
