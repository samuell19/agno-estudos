Yeah, yeah, all right. I'm leaving now. I'll be there in half an hour. Yes. Okay. -Emergency? -Yeah. Not enough staff at the hospital. I may not come home. -Take care. -Thanks. -I can't do the dishes. Sorry. -Okay. - Hello? -Ah... This is Enatsu. Nice to meet you. I'm Kurita. -What? -Nothing. This is for you. CHINESE CHESTNUTS Oh... Oh... Thank you. This way, please. Your wife isn't home yet? No. They're short-handed at the hospital. Oh, it's really busy even on a Sunday. Do you want coffee? Thank you so much. I'm okay. Mr. Kurita... Yes. If you're just kidding me, please stop it. No. I'm not at all. I'm definitely having an affair with your wife. Well... I'm not sure of that. I was just suspicious of my wife so contacted you. Yes. Sorry about that. Then why did you come here? I want to apologize. This affair has weighed on me for a long time. When you called me the other day, I immediately wanted to say that I was sorry. That was the feeling that drove me here. I am so sorry. I understand. I guess it is what it is. You and my wife are having an affair. I understand. But... Are you really... Are you? Yes, I am. Since when? When? With my wife? It's been three years. Three years ago... I had a stroke. I was treated at the hospital where your wife works. We first met before my surgery. Before the surgery, they put a tube into your urethra. The urethra? Yes. After the operation, you can't urinate by yourself. It has to be drawn out. The tube is inserted... into your urethra. It hurts a lot. I was surprised by the severity of the pain. I looked up... and it was your wife... inserting the tube into my urethra. Our eyes met. Your wife looked at me... almost with contempt. I didn't mean to. But with her looks... my lower regions became like-- Okay! That's enough! I apologize. I completely fell in love with her devotion. When I couldn't move, she was always beside me and supportive. That's why we became sexually involved. At first, I think it was her dedication to me. But gradually... She started to take the initiative. Initiative? Yes. In a very dirty way. What are you talking about? Don't say stupid things like that. Masumi would never do that! If you're having an affair, it's because she feels sorry for you. As a nurse, she looked after you. That's it. Sexless, aren't you? I heard you haven't had sex for five years. What are you saying? What? Natto. She loves natto, doesn't she? Hey! Stop it! I can't eat natto. Because of the stroke... ...I have to take a drug called Warfarin. The bacteria in natto blocks the effects of the pill. That's why I shouldn't eat it. But I'm eating natto right now. Do you know why? I don't care! Because she loves it. I'd never seen a woman eating natto in such a beautiful way. And once I'd seen it, I couldn't suppress my desire to eat it. I chose to eat natto rather than being frightened of my illness. This smells like her. She stinks. What? Her crotch stinks. It's sticky. And it really stinks like natto. Shut your mouth! She doesn't stink. You just don't know. When she feels ecstasy... It smells horrible. But it's also so good. It's really like natto. You're scared of me, aren't you? The sick man you look down on... and your wife writhing in ecstasy. You can easily imagine it. That's why it's so scary. You should know this. She's a nymphomaniac. Her true self. She knows how to stimulate me exactly in the places I want. She inserts her finger into my anus. She stimulates my prostate perfectly. She seems happy when I'm in ecstasy. Her love juices come out like a flood. Even while she was working, she stank. I was thrilled. You're lying! I could smell it in the hospital room. She is turned on. When she couldn't resist, she would close the curtains and give me blowjobs. While giving me a blow job, dripping with her love juice and slobbering, she'd say... "Do you want some?" Enough. That's enough. I slobber like a dog, and thrust like a mad dog. Even after she came... her love juices overflowing endlessly, on and on. Sticky and stringy... It keeps coming out even after she comes. All right, enough! Stop it! It's a lie! Don't mess with me! Who do you think you are? Why? Why did it come to this? Please, leave. Mr. Enatsu... I sincerely apologize to you. Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! What are you doing? Oh... Are you okay? Yeah. I'm exhausted. Were you at the hospital? What? Oh, well... What is this? Chestnuts? Yeah. A guest came over. Who was it? An acquaintance... sort of. I see. I'm so hungry. Oh, we still have some rice. Looks yummy. What? Bon appétit. Ah... It's so good. Oh... Do you want some? I'm all right. Here you are. Thanks. Are you using the car tomorrow? I don't think so. Really? Good. Good. Special discount ends tomorrow. Mapo tofu sauce. Okay, what time should we go? I'll go by myself. Um... Are you sure? I think I should drive alone. I'm a bit worried... But I have to, sooner or later. Good. Good. I'm sorry. I didn't notice you at all. Are you all right? Sorry... Do you need to go to the hospital or the police? No hospital, no police... I'm okay. Where's my shoe? Oh, but... I'll be fine. But... Just give me a ride home. Um... Yes? To Ogikubo, please. Okay. MAPO TOFU Um... Yes? Did you have any plans? What? Were you going somewhere? Shopping for dinner. I see. For dinner. Yes. Sorry for taking up your time. Not at all. By the way... what's for dinner? My dinner? Mapo tofu. Mapo tofu? Yes. Do you like mapo? Well, not so much... Then, why? It's on sale. That flyer, huh? That's right. Can I see it? EASY & TASTY! MAPO TOFU Something wrong? I used to live in Sichuan in China. In China? I often ate mapo tofu there. Have you had the real thing? No. It's red like lava and it makes your tongue hurt. But that pain is addictive. Compared to that, you can't call this mapo tofu. Easy family food or something. It just annoys me. I'm sorry. It's okay. Excuse me. Yes? Do you mind if I play music? No. Go ahead. Excuse me for asking, but... Yes? Are you sick, perhaps? Um... sorry. I have a panic disorder. Oh, you do... I'm getting treatment. I'm getting better, but sometimes I still get an attack. Don’t worry, there are no cars in sight. Okay. I also have something like a disorder. Do you? I'm not sure if it's a disorder... or more of a sickness... because it's a sexual proclivity. Proclivity... Yes. I am... an extreme masochist. Let's go. Sure. This neighborhood has changed a lot. True. Do you know it well? I used to live around here. I see. Up through elementary school. Dai-ichi Nakano elementary school. Oh, really. You too, right? Dai-ichi Nakano. Um... yes. Why... We were in the same class. Nice to see you again. I'm Kurita. Kurita? Did you forget me? You may have forgotten me, but I remember you very clearly. Because you bullied me. In the second grade, you bullied me relentlessly. Eventually, I had to transfer to another school. What are you talking about?! You don't remember, huh? Bullies always forget what they did. Wait. I didn't... My proclivity... was awakened by your persistent bullying. Hold on, hold on! Please stop this nonsense! Ms. Uehara... No. Baba Akane... you were a lonely kid. You had no friends, you were always alone. And you dealt with your loneliness by bullying me. I was even lonelier. You treated me like a slave. It was brutal. You summoned me to the girls' restroom... took me to a cubicle and forced me to masturbate. One day, you called me to the gym's storeroom... and made me straddle a balance beam. You kept torturing my crotch for hours. My crotch kept swelling... Stop it! You saw my swollen crotch, and... kicked it so hard. I couldn't hold it back anymore and came onto your clothes, unintentionally... Hey! Stop this bullshit! You've lost who you are. That's why you're sick. By lying to yourself and hiding your true nature, you're betraying your body. You shouldn't make compromises like buying that bargain mapo tofu. Being a good wife is not the real you! You have to make the real mapo tofu! With lava-like chili and devilishly hot Chinese pepper. Sadistic mapo tofu is the real you! Shut up! Stop it! Run me over... What? I want you to run over me with your car. What the hell? Since elementary school... I've desperately wanted you... to torture me once again. Please! I'd give up my life... to have you run me over! To tell the truth... I threw myself at your car. But it wasn't right. It's pointless when it's my own decision. It has to be your choice to completely crush me. That's my dream. Please! Run me over. Please, run me over! Stop! Stop! How the hell could I do that?! Stop it! Don't touch me! Get out of my car! Please! Run me over. Pervert! Don't touch me! Run me over... Fuck off! I'll be waiting! I'll be here for you! I'll be here! Damn it! UNKNOWN I CAN CALL THE POLICE. Son of a bitch! Die! Hey, Akane. Akane, are you okay? Hey. Akane, here. Did you have an attack? A panic attack? Did you? Yes or no? Unlock the door. Unlock it. Are you okay? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. I was really worried. You called me and said nothing. I called you back and no answer. I looked for you all over. Oh, yeah? I'm glad. But I was really, really worried. Want me to drive? Huh? Akane, it was too soon for you to drive by yourself. I was wrong. I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize. I regret it. You're like this, so I should... Enough! Huh? Um... I'm sorry. No need to apologize. Yeah, but... You worry too much. Anyway, what was I doing? You were going to the supermarket. Was I? To buy mapo tofu sauce. Right. All right. It's ready. SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY. Momoka-san. Another drink? One more, please. Sure. RAMEN WITH EXTRA BACK FAT Ramen with extra back fat. When she found out you wouldn't come, she drank quite a lot at the bar. Then she went to a dirty ramen shop and sat down there. Why did she go there alone a week ago to order greasy back fat ramen? Think about it. You have no idea. You know nothing about her. You! Mister. What do you want? Order the same one she did. Ramen with extra back fat. Mr. Ikeyama, be careful. I told you that talking is not allowed there. People get kicked out of there for talking. If you don't do the same thing as Momoka did a week ago, I won't tell you where she is. Understand? This is a threat. I'll expose your affair with Momoka if you don't do what I say. Wait, you... Hello? -Mister. -Yes? Garlic? Lots. Hello? You can't just hang up. This conversation will end at your next penalty. I understand. I'll do what you say. So let me hear Momoka's voice. Kurita! You think you can make demands? I have her phone now. That's enough, isn't it? But, Mr. Ikeyama, you're not really worried about Momoka, are you? What do you mean? She knows that you're married and that you're just using her for sex. You're just worried because you don't want to get caught. Have you seen her Instagram? Nothing but loneliness. After you canceled, how did she feel when she was eating that ramen? You have to understand her feelings. Her loneliness of just being your friend with benefits. You have to feel it yourself. She was lonely. She was looking for a bowl of ramen that would satisfy her desires. While waiting, the sound of men slurping ramen and the smell of their sweat was drawing close. She was getting hungry. She looked over the counter. The master was adding scoops of greasy back fat over and over. Here you are. The grotesque-looking ramen is almost like a beast. Her muscles stiffen. She feels like she's about to be attacked by the beast. From the first bite, she trembles. The violent taste of pork back fat pierces her brain. Something inside her bursts. She starts eating madly, unable to resist the destructive power of the thick noodles and pork bone soup. It is truly violent. She can't stop eating. Next, she mixes the chopped garlic into the soup. She thought it was just a bit of a kick, but it was more than that. The garlic smell clings to the noodles and stimulates her appetite. She has become a slave, meekly obeying the violent ramen. And she gets moist. She's getting moist just by eating. Her desire is aroused even more when she finishes eating. An indescribable lust takes hold. Almost unconsciously, she looks at the master of this ramen masterpiece. She's convinced he's incredible in bed. She can no longer resist. "I want to be fucked by this man with his inner beastly violence." She wants it. Hey, honey. His wife is doing dishes. Momoka's heart is devastated. She feels sad. She feels miserable. She can't ruin their marriage. She feels this way because she's having an affair with you. But she's still on fire. Anyone is good enough for her now. All these men look like beasts. It doesn't matter if they're strangers. It is then... that I'm there. I was watching her the whole time. She senses it immediately. I'm not there now. Have you forgotten? I'm with Momoka right now. Since that day, we've become friends with benefits. She treats me just like you treat her. You have no right to condemn me. We're going to do another round now. I'm going to do her violently, just how she likes it. She's a bit of a masochist, so just deep throating can make her come. Stop! I don't just attack her. I also eat her pussy unlike you... Stop, I said. It's enough, you bastard! Where the hell are you?! Kurita! Penalty. Son of a bitch! Next time... be quiet. I'm sorry. Kurita! Huh? What? Momoka? What's wrong? Oh, it's you. Sorry I missed your many calls. I forgot my phone at the bar and went back for it just now. Where are you now? I'm at the bar. You said you couldn't see me today, so I was drinking alone. Are you really at the bar? Yes, I am. Momoka, let's switch to FaceTime. Yes, that's the bar. I said that. Did someone pick up your phone? Ah, yeah. A man was here, but he just left. -Is he there now? - He just left. Momoka, chase after him. What? Please. Hurry. But why? Please. Quick! Is he there? No... He's gone. Oh. Yes? Found him? No, no, no, but... I don't know. But he also gave this to me. Kuri? It's strange, isn't it? I should've given him something. Kuri. Kuri. Kuri. What's wrong? I'm sorry. For what? I wasn't able to see you very often. No problem at all. I'll go see you now. Not tonight. I can't drink any more. I'll call it a night after the ramen. Ramen? There's a place I want to go. Did you just burp? No...
