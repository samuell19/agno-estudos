[SHOUTS AND CHEERS] [HOLLERING] -Sally, come along. NARRATOR: Since the 17th century, a legend, part fact, part fiction, has become shrouded in the mists of time. And although Tayopa is of the past, it is the dream of men and women searching today and making plans to search tomorrow. -Hold. -Three days by truck, then we pick up these nags and we poke across the desert. I'm hot, I'm cold. I'm cold and I'm hot and the bus drives in by plane. -That's right Sally, that's right. Delgadillo comes in by plane because Delgadillo's the boss. And that's the way the boss wants it and that's all you have to know. -Hey! There it comes now. -I'm Delgadillo. Let's ride. [MUSIC] -The year's come and go. And through endless seasons the winds whisper down the slopes of the mountains, across the plateaus and the high desert. And as they pray to the mesquite and chaparral, they seem to call, come, come to Tayopa. NARRATOR: In the later part of the 16th century, the Jesuit padres came to the province of [INAUDIBLE] Spain. This province encompassed most of the northern west of Mexico, in what is now Arizona. Here the padres founded a chain of missions. Tayopa was a church center and a [INAUDIBLE], or the gathering point for outlying missions and mines. The padres worked the mines for over 60 years, accumulating a fortune. [MUSIC] An Indian revolt swept Mexico in 1646. And the inhabitants of Tayopa were massacred. -Many attempts were made to find Tayopa. It failed. Including expectations in the 1970s. [MUSIC] KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): Father is dead and I'm the last of the Delgadillos, owner of the silver snake hammered from the treasure of Tayopa. And bearer of the curse the Indians placed on the treasure. The curse of the snake. The records of the church-- Tom and I had agreed that it was best for the men not to know a woman was leading the expedition. I don't like the men Tom had hired. -Well, well, well, Kathryn, quite a woman to to be caught alone in the wilderness with. -Ms. Kathryn to you. -Ooh. Excuse me. I'm very sorry. -You might learn a few manners from Tom. -Well you can tell Mr. Manners that it's time for me to get my protection. -Go away from me! What protection? What are you talking about? -My protection. -Tom? What's he talking about? Protection? What does he mean? -What do you got there, Sally? -Crossbow. -A crossbow? What are you going to do with that? -Well, it's silent, it's accurate, it's deadly, and it's my friend. -Put that thing away, before someone gets hurt. -Don't you worry, Ms. Kathryn, I won't use it unless we're threatened. -Kathryn, I brought some guns along. -Guns? Now you know, you and I discussed guns. Back at the hacienda, we're not allowed to have guns in Mexico without a permit. If we are caught with guns the federales would lock us up forever. -Look, Kathryn, you hired me to bring this expedition down to Mexico and get us out safely. And in my opinion, we need some protection. We need guns. -Protection from what? [SPEAKING SPANISH] -When I was in the cantina in Nogales, I heard a story about a snake that's big enough to swallow a goat. -Well, it-- what he's saying is true. Those snakes aren't around in this part of the country. They're down further south in Guatemala. I think he's probably talking about a snake that they call the barba maria. And it does swallow goats. But, you know, we don't have those kind of snakes down here. We have rattlesnakes and we have mountain lions and we have javelinas, and I felt that we should have some guns here, Kathryn. -Bang, bang, bang, bang. -Look, now you've put a gun in the hand of a fool. -Bang, bang, bang, bang. -Hey, here comes a rider. -Wonder what he wants. -Hola. -Buenos. -Buenos tardes. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Who is this guy, Felipe? What does he want? -Oh, he's not a cooker, he wants some soup. -Well uh, ask him some questions. See what he knows about this part of the country. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -He lives right on this area. [SPEAKING SPANISH] He's just passing through. -Ask if there's any people or villages on the way to the mountains. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -I wonder if he knows anything about the Tayopa? -Shh. We only discuss that among ourselves. -The federales then. -All right, ask him, if he knows about the federales. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Not even the federales go to the mountains. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Tell him we do have guns and ammunition. The senorita likes to hunt. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Tell him, in my country it's all right for a woman, la heffa, to be a leader. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -He said not to go into the mountains but it's sure death, but I'm gonna tell him we're going south. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Watch the lock, hombre. [LAUGHTER] -Lots of luck to you too, senors. KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): The going is often slow. My father's ledger comes alive as the landmarks and reference points he so carefully detailed come and go. As we go deeper into Mexico, I can understand why my father loved this part of the world. Here, where the clocks of time have stopped centuries ago, you can almost forget the dangers that surround you. This is bandido country. And now that the guns have come out into the open, there's a fear of being intercepted by the federales, as well as the Mexican who rode into our camp. Who is he? Is he really what he seems to be? I wonder. I have memorized my father's map and notes, telling them only what they need to know. We are a group, yet we are strangers, bound only by the lust for treasure. When darkness comes, Felipe makes a simple meal and conversation is at a minimum. Sleep is often trouble, each of us dreaming of the destiny tomorrow may bring. [MUSIC] [HOLLERING] -What do they want? -They're blocking us, they don't want to let us through. -Tell them to let us pass. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Felipe, what do they want? Tell them to let us pass. [YELLING] -Hold. Let's stop for a rest for a minute. [RATTLESNAKE] [GUNSHOT] -Well, Ms. Kathryn, what do think about our protection now? -Tom, maybe you were right about the guns. -Stoddard. Stoddard I've been thinking about what happened on the road back there with those Mexicans and it's really beginning to bother me. -What do mean what happened? They were just teasing around, having so fun. What's the matter? -Well, I want to go back and check them out. How do you know they're not bandidos. -Sally, they're not bandidos, they didn't even have any guns. Now look, leave the Mexicans alone, OK? We've got a lot of work to do. We've got a long way to go. -Well, do you see what they did to Ms. Kathryn. -Sally, they're just teasing around. They're just having some fun. Take it easy. Don't worry about 'em. -Look, the pulled my hair and they pushed my horse. Nobody does that Stoddard. -Sally, look, forget the Mexicans, all right? We've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do. Forget about it, huh? -Look, Stoddard, I don't want to be caught dead in my sleeping bag. -Take it easy, Sally, take it easy. Now listen to me. If it means that much to you, you can go back. But I'll tell you what, no trouble, you understand? Take Felipe with you, go back and just see where they are. Don't talk to 'em, don't bother 'em. And no trouble. -I'm going back. There won't no trouble, all right? -No trouble, Sally. -No trouble. Come on Felipe, baby, come on. No trouble. You hear that, Felipe, baby? No trouble. We'll be back into camp by sundown, Stoddard. Let's go. -Well I don't like it but, in this case there wasn't much I could do. -Tom, I've been meaning to talk with you. I'm not very happy with the men you hired. I feel that they're trouble. They're just bad news and there's going to be tragedy in this group before long. -Well Kathryn I understand what you mean, and I agree with you. But, you know when you hired me to lead this expedition, and to hire these other men, I got the men I could find. You know you don't men that will do this kind of work around the ivy covered universities back east. You find 'em in the border towns and in the backwash of life. I didn't have a lot of time to look at these were the best I could find. Now, Sally, Sally's got problems. -I think Sally's sick. -Well I do too. I'll be frank with ya, he's got more problems, I believe then I realized when I hired him. But he's a good metal detector, ma'am. It there's anything out there that can found with a metal detector, Sally will find it. And, as far as Felipe is concerned, Felipe is a good interpreter, he's in the metal man, a good metal assayer himself. He's a good solid, stable worker. Listen, Kathryn, this will work out, you'll see. It'll all work out. -It's the feeling I have in my heart. I feel that the seed of tragedy are sown among this group. That in time it'll touch us all, even you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -The gringos we saw on the road yesterday, they told me they were going to the desert to hunt and they go to the mountains. They lie, I think I go check them. -I think we ought to kill them. -Ah, no senor. We kill them tonight and take the horses and the senorita, huh? -I think we should kill 'em now. -We kill nobody. We just take the senorita. -No, we don't kill nobody. The crazy gringos they kill themselves or the land kill them. And we have the senorita anyway, she's the only thing worth having. -I still think we should kill them now. -No! We kill them tonight! Take the senorita while they sleep and the horses! -Ah, muchachos. -Muy bien. Ay caramba . -Hey, muchachos , I will be back in time tonight, we talk about it, make the decision. -Hasta luego. That amigo give me tequila. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Did you see 'em? -Yeah, just drinking their tequila like I told you. -Did you see what they did to Ms. Kathryn? -They were just playing with here. -They pushed my horse. -They didn't mean nothing by that. -Nobody pushes my horse. -Come on, let's go. We told Stoddard we'd be right back. -We ain't going back. We're gonna kill 'em. -Kill 'em? I've never killed anybody before in my life. -Listen, you go around that way. I'll stay here. We'll crossfire, OK? -No, I won't do it. -You got a little choice, here, Felipe. Either you kill them or I kill you. [YELLING] [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMING] -Push my horse? Pull my hair? Pull my hair! Push my horse? -Tom? Here they come. -Hey, hi Tom. -Hey, Sally, what took you so long? -Why, not a thing. -Any trouble? -Why no. We rode up one side of the canyon and looked down and they were at the other. And we didn't even get a chance to talk to 'em, Tom. -No trouble? -No trouble, just like you said, Tom. -Felipe, what about what Sally said? -Well, uh-- -That's right, ain't it, Felipe? -Yeah, Tom, just like Sally says. -That's right, just like I said, right? -Say Sally, where's your hat? -Gringo bastardo! -Look! Our horses are gone! Get up! Get up! -Look around, they have to be close. -Where are they. -Stoddard, there's no sign of them anywhere. -Dammit. Now where are those nags. -These lines have been cut. -Who would take our horses? -I don't know Kathryn, but this does it. We've got to go back. -No, I'm not going back. I'm going on to the river. Three days from here there's a river and just beyond that's an old corral where a Mexican used to sell my dad horses. We can make it, I know. -Look, what we've got to do is go back to the stream where we camped yesterday. Now, we can work our way down that stream, I don't know how far it is, but we'll come to a railroad eventually. I'm sure we can make it. And from there we can get back to the border. Now look, we can re-equip in a couple of months and come back if you want to. But for right now, we've got to go back. -No, I'm not going back. I'm walking on. -OK. Catherine you want to go on. I say we should go back. Sally, what do you say? -You promised me gold and silver, the Tayopa. Are you sure about the horses? -I'm sure. There's no doubt in my mind. -Then I say let's walk. -Felipe? -Well, Tom, you're probably right. But I have to go with the senorita. -OK. It's a bad decision, it's a mistake, but let's gather up what we got left and head for the river. FELIPE (VOICEOVER): Sally's crazy. I should have told Ms. Kathryn and Tom about the killings. Since then everything has gone bad. It's as if we were cursed. KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): The sun burns into our very being. But I know we must go on. I was so sure my father's map showed the river closer. We have to go on. We have to make it. FELIPE (VOICEOVER): These boots are killing me. I wanted to side with the senorita and I want the gold and silver, but I don't want to die here. And Tom says things are bad. If we don't hit the river, we will die. KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): It's strange what your mind does at times like this. I keep feeling as if someone is watching. Watching all the time. -Listen. What's that I hear? -Come on! Run! Run! We made it. We found the river. -Oh, water. The river. The maps are right. -The river! There it is! Water. Water, yay, we finally made the river! -Water. -Come on Felipe. -OK, I'm coming. [LAUGHTER] [YELLING] -I bet Ms. Kathryn's enjoying a swim. -What are you doing here? Why aren't you swimming with the men? -We're along. We can be together. -Alone! Together! You fool! Let me get my clothes. -No. Now listen. Look, I want to talk to you OK? -Talk quickly. -Look, Stoddard will never make it. He's an old man. He'll never make it across those mountains. Felipe, he's a fool. But you and I, we're a team. You're strong, Kathryn. Strong like the gold and silver of Tayopa. -You're crazy, Sally. You're crazy. -I want you. Don't you understand? I've always wanted you. I want you now. [SCREAMING] [GUNSHOT] -Sally! -Stoddard, I'll kill you for this. -Get out of there! If I ever catch you doing anything like that again, I'm gonna shoot ya right between the eyes. KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): The trouble at the river was frightening. And everything seems to have gone wrong since our horses disappeared so mysteriously. I can't help but think of the curse. I know it's silly, but I feel as though something or someone is close by, watching and waiting. But for what? [SPEAKING SPANISH] -He has horses and he has saddles for sale. -Oh, good. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -This man remembers my father well. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] -What's he saying? -They say that we've had a long journey. But I'll tell him our journey is just about to begin. [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Tom, Felipe, mount up. Across that mountain lies Tayopa. Let's ride. [MUSIC] [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Senor, my horse is lame. I need another one. [SPEAKING SPANISH] KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): Gold fever has taken over from the aching bone and muscle. And the decision is made to ride hard for Tayopa. To try to reach camp by nightfall. [MUSIC] KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): As the light of day flickered from the sky, we found the old line cabin, just as my father had left it. -Oh, good morning, Kathryn, how do you feel? -Oh, I feel great. You know this is the spot my dad told me about. That's the house he built and crossed over on that mesa is the outline of the old Tayopa church. Up and down, you can see all of the mines shafts. Down the river there's the old Indian burial ground. -This is really something, isn't it? -This is quite an area. -Yep. Now, the old church is supposed to be on top of that mesa, right? -That's right. -And? -One of those mine shafts underneath leads to where the treasure is. -Right. Just think, 17 tons of gold and silver and jewels someplace over here. -I know. But we've go to find it quick before the river rises. We're coming into the rainy season now and those shafts will be flooded soon. -Right. We might as well get started. Sally, you and I will take the metal detector and we'll work inch by inch, the whole top of that plateau over there. Kathryn! We're going to work our way this way, down the Mesa. If I see anything worthwhile, I'll fire my gun. -Bang. [LAUGHTER] -Oh, come on. Just work the metal detector. -We'll check this side of the river for the mine shafts. -Senorita, what is this? -This Is part of the old Indian burial ground. The Indians believe when their warriors die that if they wrap them in blankets, and with their headdress and their weapons and place them face up, that their spirit would rise to the holy spirits in the sky. -This is just like going back in time. This must be hundreds of years old. -Ah, it's very old. But we're here for treasure. Which mine shaft are you going to start with, Felipe? -Well, why don't you take the lower one, and I'll take the one on the cliff. You know, it just might be the lucky one. [MUSIC] KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): Working alone, or in pairs, we have followed the directions set forth in my father's journal. But the rain and snow of several winters have destroyed key landmarks. It's very close. We must have walked over it, or by it, or around it. But somewhere within reach, is 17 tons of treasure. We've climbed up and down, used picks, ropes, shovel, a metal detector. Everything, and still not one ounce of gold. Soon we'll have to leave Tayopa. Supplies are almost gone and the tension is unbearable. Everyone is exhausted and the thoughts of making the long trip to the border empty handed only adds to our discouragement. [MUSIC] KATHRYN DELGADILLO (VOICEOVER): When I was a little girl my father used to say, "the winds that blew from Mexico were calling, 'come back to Tayopa.'" Now I wonder if those same winds are telling me to leave. -Crazy. Indians. Indians buried a Jesuit in the mind shaft that leads down to the church of Tayopa. Ah, curse. Coins. Coins. Gold. Tayopa. Kathryn. Kathryn will know. Kathryn. Kathryn. Kathryn? Kathryn. Kathryn, Kathryn, Kathryn. Listen, isn't it true that in the legend, the mine shaft that led down under the church of Tayopa, the Indians sealed off a Jesuit priest? -That's true, Sally, why do you want to know? -Kathryn. Look! -Where did you find it? Where did you find it? -Is that it? Is that it? -You found the treasure. Those were the coins that were minted by the padres of Tayopa, Sally. -I found Tayopa. What's that. -What? -That! -Oh that's just Tom's shirt. I was washing it for him. -Tom. Tom this, Tom that. Tom, tell me to go to the top of hill. Tom, Tom threatened my life. -Stop it. Stop it. I'm the leader of this expedition. -No. No, you're no leader. You're a woman. A woman that needs to be tamed. After I tame you, after I tame you, I'm gonna take you, and then, and then we're going to share Tayopa. -Stop it! I'll tell Tom and this time he will kill you. -I'm going to take you and then we're going-- Come on, Ms. Delgadillo. Come on, Ms. Delgadillo. Little more, Ms. Delgadillo. Come on, Ms. Delgadillo. Whoa, Ms. Delgadillo! [SINGING] [SCREAMING] Ms. Delgadillo. Ms. Delgadillo. Now I won't be cursed, Ms. Delgadillo, 'cause I have the bracelet. The bracelet of Tayopa, Ms. Delgadillo. -Kathryn! Anybody in camp? -Yeah, she's in camp. But not for you, Stoddard. -Kathryn! Where is everybody? Kathryn! Kathryn! -What's wrong? -I thought I heard Kathryn calling. -Where is she? -I don't know. I'm gonna look down river. You stay here and wait. Kathryn! -Here's to ya, Stoddard. Uh uh. Uh uh, little boy. Drop it. We got to drop that knife, that big ugly knife. Little boy, we got some work to do. You're going to go get my shirt. -Hold it. -You're going to go pack the bedroll, then you're gonna bag the horses, and we're gonna ride for treasure. Felipe, Kathryn is dead. And old Tom, he's dead too. But I like you, Felipe. I'm gonna let you go. I'm gonna let you go free. Go on. Go. Go to hell. [LAUGHING] Now they're all gone. I'm the richest man in all the world. [THUNDER] Not even God can take Tayopa. [LAUGHTER] -Hey gringo. Gringo get up. Hey, what happened here? [RATTLESNAKE] -Please, help me. Please, help me. A well. A well. Water. Water. It's dry. [CRYING] -It's dry. Somebody, please, please, somebody. It's empty. It's empty. No, Sally. No, don't thank me anymore. -My child. -Padre. Help me. -Tayopa. Since the 17th century, the legend, the fact, part fiction, has become shrouded in the mists of time. And although Tayopa is of the past, it is the dream of men and women searching today, and making plans to search tomorrow. Somewhere in old Mexico, high in the trackless Sierra Madres, the greatest treasure of all awaits discovery. Who knows senor, maybe, maybe you will find the Tayopa. Or, uh, maybe it will be me. Who knows. [MUSIC]
