But this morning I... I tried to be very quiet. I had my breakfast in the kitchen. I went out for hours and hours, walking there. And when I came, Chantal was out. And I stayed in the kitchen. I would stay there and... I had to get the map and everything, the addresses, agencies and things and... She told me to come here into this room and sit down and... and not to sit in the kitchen. I mean... Now that you are here... Oh, it was okay. I was sitting in the kitchen, smoking, thinking what to do today, trying to... I was feeling very confused because I... Oh, I was walking around Paris this morning. But I mean, I was feeling okay. Hmm, I didn't want to... I mean, I wanted to go and walk. I told you, I enjoy walking very much. Oh, it was okay. I was sitting in the kitchen, smoking, thinking what to do today, trying to... I was feeling very confused because I... I was walking around Paris this morning. But I mean, I was feeling okay. I can't spend my whole day walking in the street. We were walking with me as we went to the post office. And I saw these dogs, and I... At once when I saw them, from a distance, I... I started being afraid. When I go to these... When I go to eat outside, when I... When I go to a bistro, to a small restaurant, as you know very well, there is always a dog there. Maybe more than one, and... And I'm afraid. And if it comes near me, I... I can't eat. I get a sudden fear. I... Oh, I don't get up. I remain sitting. But, you know, I feel very nervous, and I wait and wait and wait and... Wait till the dog goes away. Oh, yes, somehow it does... frighten me. Maybe I... Maybe I think it will start jumping against me. Well, in Helsinki, I have... I have lots of English friends, American friends, and... Finnish friends, of course. And... Oh, and we met very often. Oh, I don't want to repeat the things all the time. Well, in... We... We communicate as... people do. We... We see each other every day. I mean, that can't be different than the way you meet people in Paris. And at university, of course, I meet these people, and we talk a lot about our studies, and... Of course, we talk about other things, too. Well... Oh, yes, I do very much. Especially, I... Oh, I like very young children. Babies, so one, two years old. But what does that thing to do? Oh... Well, I don't know. I... I feel it's... You know, it's good to be with children. It's hard work, but... You know. Oh, the same reasons why many people like. I got very depressed when I came to France for the first few days. I... I was feeling depressed all the time. But now I have got over it. But... Well, not... Not completely. I'm not sure. I mean... I don't know. I mean, I... I can't see anything. I'd love to be in Aix-en-Provence and see Jean-Luc. I went to Anvers, but... I was here for one week, that's true. Well, I could have gone to Anvers before, but... Then I met Jean-Luc. I wanted to see him more, to stay here. That was the only way to see Jean-Luc. You know, Philippe... hates the campus, and he... he just suddenly felt very aggressive about.... I showed you a letter, you know. He... He wrote to me then. "Pierre, he has his girlfriend... and the baby... Oh, I saw the two girls today who live here in the third room. And, you know, they both had a bath one after the other. They spent about, say, 30 minutes there in the bathroom. They said good morning and something like that. Are they still on holiday, or... or are they staying there all day long, because... because I only saw them this morning, but not afterwards. I still have something in my eyes. I don't know what it is, but it's still bothering me. Hmm. A bad thing happened again to me. Did you hear when I told? I was looking in the Metro, you know, the line map, in the street outside the station, and I was all alone there in the street corner, and... and a young man came. Oh, I didn't know what nationality, but... hmm, not French, and... First he started talking with me, and I didn't say anything. I was looking at the map, because, you know, I was a bit nervous, because I tried to find the direction, because I was not quite sure how to... what to take, and... you know, he... I didn't say anything to him, and he started... how do you say... pinching? Pinching, yes. And, you know, I was... I was a bit afraid, because he took... he took hold of my arm, and... and I started going away, but... you know, of course I came back... afterwards, and... and then I went down to the Metro. Oh, things like that always happen to me, every time I go somewhere on my own in Paris. Something like that. I get followed in the street, so... at the Metro station, so... or something like that, and... oh, my arm is still hurting. He really... he really grabbed me, and... and well... and I was a bit afraid now, because there... really, there's no one near me. I mean, I was quite alone there. Everything is... you know, everything is closed today. There are... there are not so many people walking in the streets. It is a moment when really... mmm, a bad moment. Yes, when I... yes, when... in July, when I was here, or... when I went shopping, or... you know, things like that happen, as I told already. Oh, not different, but... maybe I'm more used to it now, because... well... I'm in a happy mood now. It can't be explained with phrases. Oh, I wish we could turn the radio on... and listen to the classical music. I love chamber music, Vivaldi, Mozart. I went out this morning and I heard the church bells again. You know, there's a church near us. And that reminds me of London and the church bells there. And I love big cities. I love the sounds of church bells in big cities. In London I was... once I was staying near the church of St. Pancras. And we heard both Big Ben and St. Pancras in the place we were staying every morning and in the daytime. Now I'm thinking of London and I'm thinking of a book I read. It's called "Mrs. Dalloway" by Virginia Woolf. It tells about 1920s London. And I... I have a picture in my mind. These words keep coming to my mind. The 1930s London with the 1930s cars. Ladies with big fox fur over their shoulders. And I have... Oh, London, I have my dreams to live there maybe later this winter after Christmas. I have dreams of sharing a flat there. Oh, in London too, when I go out there, when I go by the underground trains and when I walk in the streets, I get these curious looks. In Paris too I get these looks, but they are kinder here. In London there's something... not always so nice in the curious looks I got. Oh, there are so many things I want to do, so many things, but I'm afraid I'll never be able to do these things. I mean, how can I even... I can't even turn the gas on, the gas cooker in the kitchen. I'm afraid of open fire. I think the whole thing's going to blow up against my face. I want to learn to play the side flute. Oh, why can't I be a painter? I can't do anything. I would like to paint everything I see now in my mind. Not talk, just make pictures that are now in my mind. Oh, our garden is stupid. It's a small and middle class, poor dull garden. Oh, it's okay, not so small, but nothing spectacular. And in winter there's only snow, depressing. Oh, and I should wash my... I should wash some of my clothes now that I'm here, but I can't. I'm too lazy to do anything now. I'll wash them in Finland. And I have bought some clothes in France. A poppy red skirt in Grenoble. And I bought a glass ring. It gives many colours when you turn it. It's like crystal. Oh, I played with it when I went to some lectures at the campus. I'm so unpractical. It makes people mad. My mother too, she gets mad because I burn folds in the cooker, my room is dirty, I keep losing my things and so on. Oh, I still have something in my eyes, still bothering me, all the time. I can't remember exactly, but... Oh, I never got over it. I've got a lifetime fear of dogs. Oh, I was simply attacked by a dog when I was four or five. I can't remember. There's not much to tell. Oh, I don't like my hair. Oh, my hair is dirty. My hair, for one thing, it is very dirty. For the second, to wash it, it gets dirty then, kind of hotness. Oh, I don't like my hair, not especially. It is the Scandinavian type of hair, not very nice. I don't like it. I don't like the colour. I like either very blonde or very dark, and my hair is between brown. In France it may look blonde, but... Maybe here, but... Because most people are dark, but in Finland it's the sort of dirty blonde. Being alone, you know, sometimes I feel alone, but sometimes when I'm on my own. just alone or in a room in a flat, in a house, still I don't feel lonely. But if you're on your own, you sometimes... I mean, sometimes I do feel lonely, and sometimes I don't. It has nothing to do with the company, but still I... And I was a bit nervous and I just talked to this guy. He asked where I studied French, and I could only answer "à l'école", and. not more, and that is very bad. And he... Well, then I was promised to start then. They didn't know when. That was the end of May. Then they didn't know exactly when the conference was going to start, but at the end of June... Oh, I can't remember. Anyway, at the beginning of July. And then in June, at the end of June... Oh, I love the thunderstorm. Oh, I love the noise it is making, and I love the raindrops popping on the window. Oh, can you hear the noise? I am not afraid of thunder. I... I love the lightnings, and... Oh, there's something I'd like to... I'd like to go to the window and watch it. I... I'd like to... I'd like to see... I mean, I love the special light it's giving. The lightning, I mean. Oh, it... Do you hear? It must be a heavy rain then. I really hear now the heavy raindrops popping on the window again, but now I hear the... Oh, the noise, oh... It's going away, I think. Oh, I get this... I get this headache every time, and I thought there will be a thunderstorm later, and now I'm really having this headache. Oh, I'm feeling, I'm getting it because... because of the thunder. So my head is like... What is it now? It's like a thermometer, kind of... You know, it tells what kind of weather we are getting. Oh, that rain. I wouldn't mind being outside now. Oh, it's good to sit inside and listen to the rain and... Oh, it's... Oh, it's really pouring. Really, but it's good. Paris will be fresh and clean after this rain. It's better. Oh, and I hope the air gets... I hope this heavy air gets cooler now after this thunderstorm. You know, it clears the air. It was so hot and so horrible. I felt all know, all my clothes were trying to... to strangle me. I felt I want to get out of my clothes, out of the shops, out of everything. And the Metro... Oh, yes, we all know the Metro is like a hell when it's hot. So... this thunderstorm is... is like a present, you know. For me, it's... it's like a present. Oh, there's a fire engine. Can you hear? So... this thunderstorm is... is like a present, you know. For me, it's... it's like a present. Oh, there's a fire engine. Can you hear? It's going down this street, I think. Or... or maybe it's the next street, you know. Anyway, I hear it very loudly. Maybe there is a fire somewhere because... because of the thunder. Maybe it's going there, but... I wonder if... if it's the ambulance, maybe. Because there's only one voice. I mean... I was going to work for the radio and television department, but I mean that I would have met newspaper and TV people from all over the world. Oh... it didn't mean all the world, but say half the world. Oh, I know. It is very pathetic. You know, lots of people have the possibility of studying at the university. It means you have... you have jobless people after taking the degree and you can... you know, some people work in offices doing some dull work just to get money to survive. Maybe the dog belonged to some farmhouse and I was walking, can't remember, maybe with my aunt or somebody and I really... I wasn't attacked by the dog, but I can't remember. Oh, did you hear that bang? I'm sure... you know, now the thunder, now the thunder again. It must be very near. Oh, I love the thunderstorm. I love the noise it's making and I love the raindrops popping on the window. Can you hear the noise? I'm not afraid of thunder and I still hear the thunder somewhere far away. Oh, it's like... it's like spinning around this area. It's going... going over and over these houses, these quarters. When we will wake up next morning, we will have a fresh, clean morning, a little bit cooler than it has been now.
