(rushing waters) (slow gentle music) (crashing waters) (seagulls cawing) - We believe that human life is sacrosanct. It's cherished blessed by almighty God. So when we come to cast our vote on the abortion act in the form of an amendment to article 40 of the Irish constitution, the rights of the unborn child, it is our duty to vote yes, to that amendment. Why this is not a question of what you or I may think, this is a fundamental of our faith, of what we believe. And I say to you, it cannot be right that the most dangerous place for a baby to be is in its own Mother's womb. - Who is this that? (cow mooing) Who is that? - [Robbie] Oh, who is this now? This my helper? Hi Una. I'll be in there in a minute. (rustling waters) You're big and strong aren't ya? All right, you're big and strong. You coming over Trudy, aren't ya? Get in there. (cows mooing) (door slams) - I got your paper. - Thank you. - I got you some chocolate. - Thanks Mom. (slow gentle music) (car honking) - Taxi for Sarah. - I wasn't gonna wait. Didn't wanna disappoint myself. (car chugging) - I'll see ya at backroom with the superintendent. - I've only just heard about it. - I can't see why we can't handle a simple case like this ourselves. - I'd say the superintendent has his reasons. They wouldn't bring the bureau down from Dublin unless... - The murder squad for a wee tot washed up on the beach? (Dooley chuckles) The heavy gang, for this? (slow paced music) - You okay? - Yeah. You? - Yes. I am when I'm with you. You work too hard. I love you, Paudi. - You know I love you too. - You know, I've been thinking, it'd be better for us if I asked Ger to move back into the house with Mom, and I can move into the cottage. Rather than waiting on the counseling forever. We don't have that long. Una needs to see her daddy, and we need to be a proper family. - Don't worry. It'll be fine. I better be moving, Sarah. - Does Anne never ask about me? - We don't talk that much. Not like us. - Then we have to be together then. - Yeah, you're right. I'll wait for you. Pick you up after work tomorrow. Yeah? - Yeah, you better. (door slams) (slow paced music) (door slams) - Superintendent. It's good to see you, sir. - And you Sergeant Dowling, how are you getting on? - Very well, sir. I didn't expect to see you so soon. - I'd heard about the baby on the beach. And I was due home this weekend anyway, Mick. Who's doing a post-mortem? As I'm here. - Professor Palmer. He's over at Saint Rita's. - Who's that baby? Who's that? Baby girl? Huh? That's Frances. Is it? Oh, she's lovely. (metal clanking) Hey Ma, I put the kettle on? Ma. - You were late again last night. Did I hear his car? - Yeah, he dropped me home. (metal clanging) - If your Father were alive today to see this carry on... - What carry on? - He's a married man. - He's also Una's Daddy. - He is a married man. They have taken their vows before God. They can never be divorced or parted. He ought to know better. - Mom, we love each other. What about what I want? (door knocking) - Oh, hello Father, come on in. - [Father] Catherine? - Windy day. Patsy, it's Father O'Reilly for you. - How are ya? Please sit down. - You're right Superintendent, that was my first reaction. But this baby didn't die in the water. Now these lesions and skin damage could have resulted from the baby being dashed on the rocks, but these small knocks on the skin here are in fact stab wounds. Now some of them barely break the skin like, like here, as if somebody was testing the resolve to see if they could complete the stabbing motion. There's no doubt here. And these five puncture wounds on the chest are the ones that penetrated the baby's chest cavity and killed it. If you count the wounds, there are 28 in total. All made with a thin bladed knife. Oh, and there's some damage here to the back of the skull. Just here. (slow paced music) (Sarah coughing) (door knocking) - Sarah. - [Sarah] Yeah, I'm fine. It's just something I ate. (woman humming) (slow gentle music) - Sarah, you're not leaving are you? - No, I told Paudi I'd meet him here. - Oh, right. What's up? - No, nothing. Just, I brought him a present. I didn't want to make fuss about it, you know yourself. - Can I have a look? - Yeah. Hope he likes it now. - It's lovely. God you're as good to him. A bit smart for work, mind you. - It's not for work Marian, give over. - Tricky to wear at home. You haven't heard have you? Paudi's wife, she's expecting a baby. - What? How could he? - Sarah, he's a married man. Speak of the devil. Look after yourself, all right? - [Paudi] What's up? You're not going through? - When were you going to tell me about Anne? - I was gonna tell you, on the way home later. - But you know I'm carrying your baby. You know that Paudi. - Sarah, it'll be fine. Don't worry. - Look after yourself. - [Woman] I think you've got to call (indistinct). - Good luck Ger. - Patsy, here. - That would work grand for us. Thank you again Michael, you know it. - Not a bother, Catherine. - I hope you don't mind me asking. - Not at all, I popped by the weekend. - Do. Thanks very much. - Good luck. - God bless - God bless. (engine turns) - Patsy, two o'clock. Punchestown. Lucky boy blue, Jumping Jack or Take to the hills? - Oh that door wind'ad take the skin off yah. - Patsy. - Shergar. - You know what happened to Shergar. Shergar. - I won a lot of money on that horse so I did. - You'd be lucky now. He's been dead this past year. So they say. (woman humming) (bird cawing) (slow paced music) (heavy breathing) (clock ticking) (cows mooing) - We've checked the list of births in from over the last 18 days. - And the house to house inquiries? - Nothing so far. (phone ringing) Sergeant Dooley, can I help you? - I think we should extend the search. If the mother was from around these parts, we'd of had word by now. We know all this community. - [Dooley] Okay, thank you. (water pouring) - She'd been here all night. I didn't hear. Why didn't she say? - Just go on up and get Ger love. It's all right, she's just sick in the night. (slow paced music) (chickens clucking) - Mona, Mona, Mom said you'd know what to do. Sarah's bleeding, Mona. - [Doctor] How many weeks? (window knocking) - How many weeks is your Sarah carrying? Gosh, I couldn't really say for sure now doctor. I'm a friend of the family, I'm just helping. - [Doctor] Very well, I'll arrange to treat her, but I shall have to notify the Gardai if I believe that she's over 28 weeks on in her pregnancy. - [Mona] Is that so? - Serg, its a questionnaire from the country about that baby they found on the beach. It says here they're sending in the murder squad. - Oh. (slow paced music) - After scanning your womb, Ms. Flynn, it appears to be empty. Were you trying for a baby? - Not especially. - And are you sure you haven't given birth in the last few days? - Well, I'm pleased to see that the hemorrhaging has now been stabilized. I think we can let you go home today, but you must rest. As you say, you've lost a lot of blood, you're quite anemic, rest is called for. (slow paced music) - [Radio] It's one o'clock, it's time to go to the news room for the lunchtime news. - [Woman On Radio] A man died today when he was struck by debris from an explosion which was triggered at the Derry City car park. It was an attempt to kill members of the security forces. (slow paced music) (doors slamming) - Right. I've moved this murder inquiry up here to this Town Garda Station because the suspect could be living locally, and may have simply driven down to the coastal rode to dispose of the body. You all live and work within this community. So you'll be able to help identify any suspects. You need to tell us about any women you know to have been pregnant, say over these last few months. Pay special attention to women already raising an illegitimate child, women living alone, or living in sin, or a woman that may have suddenly disappeared from the area. If a woman is known to you as having been pregnant, then she must produce the baby when you make your inquiries. If you have any doubts or suspicions, then come and talk to me personally. I'm always available in my office. All right, thanks gentlemen. (slow paced music) (people chattering) (door knocking) (clears throat) - Sarah in is she? - Yeah. Sarah! - So, what happened? - I lost it. How's Anne then? - Yeah. - Jumper looks good. I'm glad it fits. You sorry we lost our baby? - It's meant to be. And how's your Una doing? - She's already on the potty. You need to go home. - Oh, you're not going now are ya? I can drop you back later. - No. No, I'm tired. (Sarah clears throat) - Listen, I'm not expected back to til 10. - Go back to Anne, Paudi. Look after yourself. (woman humming) (door knocks) - Your duty log shows that you may have had an abortion case in here last week that wasn't reported. - There was one young woman who was showing as a pregnancy, but the scan was recording an empty womb. - What was this woman's name? - Well my code of ethics prevents me- - Overseeing an abortion is a criminal offense, doctor. - I never carried out an abortion. (door knocking) - Yes. - Sir, a family I want to talk to you about. They live in a small holding with a few cows. The mother Catherine, her brother Martin was a justice for the peace. He was one of the signatories for our warrants over the years. They're a well regarded family. The sister Patsy was a nurse, she worked overseas. She moved back a few years ago to live with the family. It was around the time that Katherine's husband, Paddy passed away. I think there's another sister too, sir. I believe she's a nun. Just talked to the daughter who was admitted to Saint Thomas' with a miscarriage. - What's her name? - Sarah Flynn, sir. She already has an illegitimate child with a local married man. - Right. - [Coleman] Sir. - There's no registration down for this pregnancy with any doctor. - Nothing we found, sir. So this Sarah Flynn willfully kept this birth a secret. Putting the child at risk. Were you aware that she was pregnant? - No, sir. Not this time, but the mother Catherine did ask me to talk to her about her carrying on with a married man. - [Marian] God, above the noise of them, you'd swear they were drowning. - [Sarah] I like the noise. - Good morning gentlemen. Can I help you with anything? - [Officer] Morning. Yes, we're looking for one Sarah Flynn. - That's me. I'm Sarah Flynn. - Right, well Miss Flynn, we'd like to ask you some questions. (slow gentle music) Thanks. (door knocking) - Mrs. Catherine Flynn? - Yes, that's right. - I'm Sergeant Dowling and this is Detective Stack. We'd like to have a word with you please. Can we come in? - [Patsy] Oh the door! - That's my sister. - Patsy Kerrigan. - Do you all live here? - Yes. - No. - [Ger] Well, I don't sleep here, but I do live here. - We have another place in the field over. - Take a seat there. There she is now, sir. - [Catherine] You've got nothing at all to worry about son, just look after Robbie. - Patsy, your bag. - I can't leave me cows. Mom! - [Catherine] Just go on, go on. You won't be long, Robbie. - [Officer] Mind your head. (engines turning) - Miss Sarah Flynn's lover, sir. - Sarah Flynn. I'm Superintendent Callahan. We have some questions for you. - [Officer] Come with me. Just through here. Park yourself in there. (woman humming) (door slams) (slow gentle music) - You'll be informed at the appropriate time. This way. In here. Just in here. Just in here. - [Man] Come on. - [Officer] No, no, no, you stay there. - [Man] Take a seat there, all right. (doors slamming) (door slams) - [Kennelly] So tell us about this baby. - What baby? - The baby you had. - I never had a baby. (slow paced music) - [Frances] The barn's just up here. - So what time of night was it when she went outside? - Did she go outside, at night? - Yeah, you know she did. She had the baby in the bed beside you, then she brought it out here and threw it in a fertilizer bag, like one of these. When did you first know your sister was pregnant? - I don't know. - You shared a bedroom with her yet you didn't know she was pregnant? - I don't know. - And that's where the baby was born? So Frances must've come to fetch you. Yeah? Is that right? - I don't remember. Maybe Frances fetched me. - Was it a shock seeing the newly born baby, as it was on the end of Sarah's bed, since you said you didn't know she was pregnant. - Mm, that must be right. - Garda Hill. - Sir. - See that these get to Superintendent Callaghan. (slow paced music) - Very good sir. - You know what this is? This is the afterbirth. Did you and Sarah bring this out from your bedroom? So how do you suppose it got here? - So was it your idea to get rid of this baby? Last thing you wanted was another child. - No, Sarah said she had a miscarriage. I was at home all night, with my family. They'll say. Please, can I go? There's no need to tell my wife I'm here is there? - So, which is Sarah's bed? - This. - What, here? And Francis there? And where was the baby when you walked in? What, like here, at the end of the bed? - I don't know. On the bed there, just sort of next to Sarah, if you like. - What, like here? You saw the baby here? - Yeah, sort of just there on the side, sort of. Yeah, it was just there on the side. And Patsy stood there too. - And where did you see the bath brush that Sarah used to hit the baby with? - Just there, it was on the- Just somewhere there on the side there. There, just, yeah, that was it. - All right. So tell me about this baby, Robbie. - [Robbie] Una. - No, the baby! This new baby that Sarah had! - Una's over a year now, so. (people chattering) - I need to wait there, Sarah. There'll be further questioning. - There's a native fucking cunning in this family. Robbie knows more than he's letting on. - Detective Stacks sent these over, sir. And there's a note. - "Catherine Flynn confesses she was in the room "when the baby was born, sir." - And the lads found these at the Flynn house, sir. - Right. - So from my notes, this is the statement that you made at the house earlier to Sergeant Dowling about what happened that night, is that correct? (Frances grunts) I need you to sign just here. Good girl. So, we now agree, your statement says there was a baby. - I think so. That's all I... - Did you cut the baby's cord? (slow paced music) - No. - Aren't sure? So did Patsy cut it? - It was dark. Yeah. (door knocking) - [Stack] Excuse me. Yeah. They've admitted it? Under oath? And he put the baby in the fertilizer bag? And they both drove out to the beach. Grand. - Who's that? - What, that? Oh, just a little bird telling me a few things, about your family. - And then you both drove out to the beach that night. - No, no, I don't have a car. - But you drive Patsy's car. A blue car was seen at the Headland that night. And what color is Patsy's car? - Blue. - Blue. Not looking good for you, huh? When did you first know that Sarah was pregnant again? - When mom said she'd lost the baby. - "Lost" you call it. Murdering a baby is lost in your house, is it? Your sister's just admitted stabbing her baby. We know what happened. Then you drove to the coastal with that brother of yours- - [Man] You and Robbie drove to the cliffs to throw the baby into the sea! You know you fucking did! - [Man] Nobody leaves til you all sign your fucking statements! - [Man] This is your last fucking chance! You sign this statement or you'll never see daylight again! - [Man] Baby into her chest. - [Man] Did you drive down to the cliffs with your baby? - [Man] We know you was there! - [Man] Sign the statements. Sign them. - When Sarah killed the baby. - [Man] Swear on this Bible, you didn't kill your baby! (table thuds) - [Man] For fucks sakes man! On this map, show me the route you took to get to the coast road! - [Robbie] I never went to the beach. - Right. Point out the beach on this map, exactly where the cliffs are you threw the baby from. - I can't, I don't know. - You fucking do! (table thuds) You drove to the coast road on that Thursday night with that fucking brother of yours! - I was in bed. It was dark, I never went anywhere. (officer sighs) - [Man] Do you want to see the inside of a jail tonight Robbie, hm? - No. I need to see to my cows. - Your Mother's told us what happened. This is your last chance Robbie. Now, if you ever want to see those cows again, you'd better sign the statement. - The baby was stabbed 28 times. Would this be the knife you used? It was taken from your kitchen? - No. I could never harm a baby. - Not even after Paudi told you his wife was pregnant too? That's when you lost all interest in this baby, wasn't it? In your mind it was dead then. When it arrived, it was easy. Is this is what you use to batter your baby with? - No. I could never harm a child. Never. I could never hurt a baby. That's not my baby. I didn't have my baby. - [O'Shea] So you did have a baby? - But not the baby you're talking about. That's not my baby. - So what exactly did you do with your baby? - I held him and I cradled him. He was so still. He never moved. He was a stillborn. He was dead in my arms. - And where is your baby now? - I hid him on the farm. I was so ashamed. I'll show you. Please, can I show you? - Who helped you? - I was all alone. - So who cut the baby's card? - There was no knife. I pulled the cord, it broke. I was all alone. I was so scared. I never had a knife. I was scared when he didn't move. Please. Jesus, God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please help me. Please. - Ma'am, would you like to come with me, Patsy? Just in this room here. - Sergeant, we need to organize a search. She's now saying she's hidden the baby on the farm. - Right sir. - Did you bring in the knife to cut the baby's cord? - When, when do you mean? - The night the baby was murdered in your house. - What baby? Will you never cop-on? It's cold in here. Do you not find it cold in here? Where's my handbag gone? - Listen to me, Patsy. Catherine Flynn, your sister, told me today that you were in Sarah's room the night the baby was born, okay. So did you bring in the knife to cut the baby's cord? (slow paced music) - Where's my niece gone, Sarah? - [Man] Look lively now lads! When you're done with the gully, check the shed in the old barn! - Yeah, bye bye. - According to the medical records, Sarah Flynn and Paudi Keane are both blood group O. Let's see what comes back from the labs for the other baby. - [Kennelly] Right. - [Callaghan] This is the route that they took. - [Kennelly] Well they might have come this way. - Auntie, are you okay? I'm sorry, I've made this much topper for ya. I signed saying so. I killed the baby. I killed my baby. I mean they told I must have done it. I must have. - My child- - No Patsy, listen. It's for the best. It's too late now, I did it. I know I did. You tell them that I stabbed the baby and that I beat it until it was dead. You tell them that you were in the room. Tell them that I killed the baby. I don't wanna see any one now. Let them put me in jail. And I want you to go home to Mom, Auntie, okay? Tell them Patsy. You have to tell them that I did it. And then you could go home. All the family can go home. But please take care of Una. Don't let them take her. Oh God, don't let them have her Auntie. Please. - Patsy Kerrigan. (melancholy music) - Oh yes, it was born in the house, in Sarah's room. I helped, I was there right enough. I helped to break the waters. - So this baby, it was born alive then? - Oh yes, I heard it, very chesty. I don't know a lot about babies. I worked as a nurse, you know? - So what exactly did you do? - I helped to break the waters. Then the baby came. I was doing my best to help her. It was a baby boy, I saw it move. It was burbling with mucus. I was not in the room when the baby died. After that, I don't know how it happened, but I remember it was light before I was getting to bed. I've always done nights. - And you saw all of this Patsy? - Oh, I did. I helped with the baby too, well someone had to, I cut the cord for her. She'll tell you. - But didn't Sarah break the baby's cord? - No, I cut it. I cut it, I took a scissors and cut it. (people chattering) - I read the Catherine Flynn statement. She didn't take an active part. No, it was Ger, Robbie, and Frances that came up with a plan to get rid of the baby. Charge them with concealment of the birth. That includes Patsy. Then they can go. Sarah Flynn, you are being charged with murder of an unknown infant. Sergeant. - [Kennelly] Sir. (Sarah crying) Come with me. (slow gentle music) (woman humming) (doors closing) - Hello Father. - That's an early one for you now, Catherine. - It's the Gards, Father. They've taken our Sarah away. - So I believe. - I wonder if you could you add Sarah to prayers today, Father, please? - I don't think it'd be appropriate in the mass, but I could include her when saying my office. Under the circumstances, that's all I can do. Why don't you light a candle, Catherine? Offer up a prayer to the blessed Virgin. - Thank you Father. It would be a great help for you to come and say mass with us out at the house so that we could all be there and, we would love your blessing. - I think it best for the moment, if I see you and the family in church. Let's see how things turn out with Sarah. If I am to say a blessing, it would need to be in another church, not here. I have to think of my congregation. (Catherine sighs) - I'm what's known as a free legal aid lawyer. Now, today will be simply a remand. That means we hear the charge, nothing more. So they will detain you in Limerick prison, but the family will be able to leave today. - Sorry, that's you now Pat. This is the Flynn family. - Listen, listen Frances, we need to find the baby. The baby I had, I left it on the farm that night. - I'll help you. - No. They're not going to let me home. You have to find him. - Okay. (slow gentle music) (cow mooing) - It's too late for tears. (woman humming) - You can imagine the three of them taking this journey that night. Ger driving, Robbie and Frances looking for a place to lose the baby. (slow gentle music) - Helen, can you take any messages? I'm going out to see the Flynn family. Lock the office when you leave, I won't be back. Oh, can you ring my wife? Explain that I won't be able to pick her up. She wanted to... Just explain for me, I've gotta run. - Good luck Pat. - Thanks Helen, bye bye. - She's very confused about all this. She needs to rest nowadays. - None of this will be helping. - I am trying to get Sarah home as soon as I can, Catherine. Will the baby be all right? - Sure, we all love her. I just never expected to see the family like this. We're good people. Just Pat, if you have a minute. I'd like to tell you what happened to them with the Gards. - Of course, I'm here for you, Catherine. Take as long as you need. - They had a terrible time. The Gards were shouting and shouting. Poor Robbie believed them. He thinks something terrible must have happened to a baby here at night. I'm sure nothing happened. Nothing. It's all I have to say. - [Dowling] This is where Ger says he threw the bag from, off the top of this headland. - [Callaghan] Then the current must've swept it out to sea, ending up being washed up on the beach in the Bay where it was found. - There are nearer beaches. I guess they drove the 50 miles down to here to be sure to be swept out to sea, without a trace. - They would have parked where we are and walked to the edge to throw the baby directly into the water. Where was the witness that night? - A Garda car was parked at the Bay around the bend. Saw a blue car driving away. (gentle music) (cow mooing) (water splashing) - Robbie! Mom! Robbie! Please! - They found something sir, out in the Flynn farm. (slow paced music) - Who found this? Where'd it come from? - I found it here. I don't know. - Frances, Robbie, just follow me please. - [Callaghan] So what's happened out here? - [O'Shea] We did a thorough search, sir. And now, they produce another baby. - [Callaghan] Nah, this goes back to Sarah. She had these two children murdered them, and arrange for the family to dispose of the bodies. (people chattering) (phone ringing) - Denny, Denny it's the phone again. It's the third time. - Third time, lucky. Denny Rice, "The Irish Post." Yeah. - [Woman] I've got some information for you. - And you are? - [Woman] That's not important. Are you alone? - Hold on. Yeah, go ahead. - [Woman] I've got some information for you over this murder trial. - This is the Flynn case, yeah? - [Woman] Yeah. - Did you attend their interviews? - [Woman] Not exactly, but I know what happened. - Great. - [Woman] They were held against their will. - How long? - [Woman] Over 12 hours. - I see. - [Woman] There's a lot more, you interested? - Yeah, very interested. - [Woman] So what's next? - Can we meet? - [Woman] In secret. - How do you mean? - [Woman] I'll give you the story, I need protection. - We never had this phone call. - It's for her own safety, Catherine. She's still in custody technically, but she'll be more comfortable in hospital. So you mustn't worry. - Would I be able to see her, Pat? I've packed some bits and pieces I thought she might need. - Leave it with me, I'll take them in for you. - I don't know what I would have done. - Catherine, I can't say now, sitting here, that it will be all right. - No. - [Pat] Sarah's still being held on a murder charge. - Wanted to call my baby Paul. He's being buried tomorrow. (slow gentle music) It's his funeral. - Now this case will send a signal out that a human life is sacred and not something to be disposed of for the convenience of any woman in the country. - I'd like to see more women called to book. This practice of exposure deaths. That's killing a child in any other language. As sure as stabbing the baby in the heart. - May God forgive her. - When will they let Sarah home Mom? I wrote my name on a bit of paper about her. - We all did, Robbie. You did what's best for your sister. You're grand, you're grand. You shouldn't be worrying about it. Pat said that it would be all right, so it will. - There isn't a village in Ireland that hasn't heard about this case, Mr. Rice. I trust that "The Irish Daily Post" has its facts straight? - We have. I'm just giving you the right to reply Minister. - We need more time. - That's not possible I'm afraid. It's out of my hands now. (cows mooing) - Hello. - Hello Father. - Hello Father. - Morning, Catherine. I thought I'd take advantage of the break in the weather to get out and make a few well-deserved calls. - Yeah. - How's Patsy fairing? - She's getting by. We all are Father. It's Sarah that I'm worried for. She's not the strongest. I wonder, would you be able to help us with the baby's funeral, Father, please? - Sadly, Catherine, I can't. Not this week. Well, best foot forward, huh? God bless you, Catherine. (solemn music) - We'll need close shots of the mattress, the floor, the bedding, okay? - Yes, sir. - [Stack] Good. - It's right here in front of me. In black and white! - [Man] What, what is? - A transcript of Rice's article. - [Man] For who? - For "The Irish Daily Post." - [Man] Well, what do you want me to do? - Well, I'll speak to the Taoiseach personally. (man on phone speaking too low) This undermines the case! - [Man] Why? - We can't afford anymore accusations. - [Man] Who says? Callaghan- - Oh for Christ's sake, this is not an IRA bloody gang! That's their mindset! Against a God-fearing country family! (man on phone speaks too low) Well is it surprising that they were scared witless and said anything? (slow gentle music) (rain pouring) (bucket clangs) - Oh, there you are. Oh, oh darling! Oh! Welcome back. - Thanks Mom. - Are you all right? - [Sarah] How's Una? - [Catherine] She's been grand. She's grand, look at her. - Hi! - [Catherine] She's lovely. Oh she's lovely! Come on in, come on in! - [Sarah] Let's see ya! - [Catherine] Yeah, isn't she lovely? - [Pat] Let's go on. - [Catherine] Oh, take off your coat now. - [Pat] Thanks Catherine. - Take it off here. (slow gentle music) - The test results are given as follows. Paudi Keane and Sarah Flynn are both blood group O, as is the baby found on the Flynn farm. While the baby found on the beach, is blood group A. In view of this, the DPP assures me the murder charge against Sarah Flynn can no longer stand. - Sarah Flynn is the mother of both babies, and both infants perished at the Flynn farm. She's already confessed to murdering the baby by stabbing it. - Paudi Keane can't have fathered both babies. - Then she must have been involved with two different men, sir. She's that kind of person. (slow paced music) - I was able to bring her home because the judge believed me. That it would be the best thing for her wellbeing. - Yes. - I've decided to lodge an official complaint against the Gards on behalf of you and the family, and that should shake things up. - Well thanks Pat. That's great news. - Okay. - [Catherine] That's such a help. God bless you. And safe home now. - I'll see you Catherine. - [Catherine] Thank you very much. Thank you. - God bless. - [Palmer] I'm aware of a case in America, a woman who gave birth to twins, one of whom was black, the other white. Now as in this case, it would mean Sarah Flynn would have had to have had sexual intercourse with two different men within a very short space of time. It's called super fecundation. (Callaghan grunts) The odds are grotesquely low Superintendent. - But you agree it's medically possible? - You'll be putting this young woman in an invidious position if you make this accusation. Who's the second man? (Callaghan grunts) - What do I say, Mom? - Well, it's just what Pat said. Put down what happened to you. You know, when they talked to you in the barracks. Just in your own words. (slow paced music) - So, put date. (slow paced music) - [Callaghan] Yeah, how's it going? - Oh, hell of a tow. - [Callaghan] You know, the currents around here? - Yeah. - If something was thrown off the cliffs across the way there at headland, would it make landfall here? - Well now, the way the current flow, down along the side of the peninsula there and out towards the islands, and verges across, down along the coast, the tide would bring anything in it's hold onto this beach here in time. - How long would it take? - One, two, three days. A month maybe. Longer, maybe never. (slow gentle music) - Where are the lads? - I think Ger's gone up. Robbie's settling the cows. - You nervous about tomorrow? (slow gentle music) You'll be grand. - This court is convened to hear the case of Sarah Flynn, who's charged with the murder of an unnamed infant. The Flynn family are also charged with concealment - Pat, Pat. - [Judge] Of the birth of an unnamed infant. - They tried to get us to hold the article. The Minister's getting involved personally now. He's opened a file with the DPP on Callaghan and his lads. From what I hear Pat, they're about to drop the charges. The case has become unsafe. Apparently the DP- - The Judge. - Intervention of the - [Judge] Minister for Justice, this case is being closed. Mr. Mann, the result is that your client Sarah Flynn is free to leave this courtroom today. (people chattering) All charges against Sarah Flynn and her family are being dropped. (gentle music) - Sarah my dear, let's get you home. All charges against you and your family are dropped. You're free to go. - Jesus Mom! - Go out and get some more! We need more cups. - Well Ger, how do you feel? - What? - How do you feel? - [Ger] Sure, I'm grand! Glad it's all over. (slow gentle music) - [Callaghan] Tom Walsh. Tom Walsh. - [Dwyer] If any of the allegations made by the Flynn family against the Gardai are substantiated, they may lead to criminal proceedings. I am recommending that a tribunal be convened to assess the many elements of the murder case and the subsequent treatment of the Flynn family during these investigations. I recommend that a judicial inquiry be set up to examine related allegations made by members of the Flynn family in statements to their solicitor concerning the circumstances surrounding the questioning and taking a statement from those persons involved. - It's called a tribunal, like a big meeting. It will be overseen by a judge and held under oath, but there are no charges against you or the family, Sarah. So you have no need to worry. This is for the Gardai to face the charges against them now, for what happened when you and the family were arrested. - Put in the papers, and this bloody circus that's built up around this case. To one side, Sarah Flynn admitted stabbing her baby! And signed saying so! - Ger confirms he saw the body of a newly born child at the foot of the bed and said to Sarah "Why in fucks name did you do it?" - This Tribunal hearing is now in session. I will be taking evidence on the events, in the murder case involving the Flynn family, and the subsequent investigation. There are charges to be answered in regards to the conduct of the Gardai and the Special Investigations Bureau, the murder squad, over their handling of the initial investigation. - I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - Mr. Keane, on that board is a map. Could you please indicate the exact spot you and Ms. Flynn were parked to have sex? - This has no bearing on the tribunals remit Dermot. This hearing was set up with the Minister to investigate the Gard's behavior. (slow paced music) - Name please? - Catherine Flynn. - She must be of loose morals. I have it on good authority that she had been involved with other men. And Mr. Keane told us he was not the first. - Then why are you finding it so hard to find these other men? - Because people don't want to come forward admitting to an association with a woman of this type. Also, I have the evidence that proves that Sarah Flynn was involved with another man while also having sex with Paudi Keane, Judge. - Proceed Mr. Callaghan. Please, exhibit 104. - This mattress was removed from Sarah Flynn's bedroom. It's her own mattress, and it establishes and identifies the existence of Sarah Flynn's other lover, Tom Walsh. Tom Walsh. Here, and here. - [Judge] Thank you. - When we find this male, we will see that Sarah Flynn - Sarah. Was having sex with two men - Sarah, wait. - [Callaghan] at the same time. - Pat, I have never seen this Tom Walsh. Honestly, they're making me out to be some sort of- - Now don't be upsetting yourself. - You were a religious and pious woman Mrs. Flynn. Should you commit perjury and die on the spot, do you not believe that you'll be condemned for eternity? - I expect, I believe. - You've taken an oath, that if God come down and witness what you say is true, are you sticking to your story? - I am. There was no baby born in the house. God's glory be to him, knows that. And if I had to come before him now, in the next five minutes, I, I am telling the truth. - And Auntie Patsy is perjuring herself? - I suppose so. - [Martin] And are you still in assisting you didn't know Sarah was pregnant at the time? - Yes, I am. - Did not the dogs in the street know it? - I expect so. (door opens) Robbie. Robbie. - Mom. - You should be away in your bed, son. You'll be up with the cows in a couple of hours. Come on. It'll be all right. You'll be grand. (people shouting) - Judge, I'm Tom Walsh! - No, I'm Tom Walsh! (men shouting) - Right, get them out, come on! - [Man] How many Tom Walsh's would the Gard's like to see? - I'm Tom Walsh! - [Man] Tom Walsh my ass! - Callaghan's brought this on himself. - He has. (men shouting) - [Men] Tom Walsh! Tom Walsh! Tom Walsh! Tom Walsh! - Yes Detective O'Shea, but we have testament here from Dr. Conlan saying that for Sarah to be carrying twins, she would have to have been grossly distended and walking in a military manner. - Native Dublin women look hugely pregnant, but a lot of country women do not look pregnant at all, in my experience, Judge. (people shouting) - Judge, here is a petition signed by women from the whole of Ireland in support Sarah Flynn. We would like you to take account of this please. - What are the women of Ireland in general to do with this case? (women shouting) (slow paced music) - Right, out of the way a minute! Stand back! Have you no homes to go to? Come on! Stand back! (metal clanking) - For God sakes Patsy, what's going on? - It's cold. It's always cold here! This house is cold! It's always cold here. (slow paced music) - If there's a repeat of the trouble we had here yesterday and today, it is my intention that the offenders will be held in contempt of court. I will personally impose a prison sentence on anyone that obstructs or assaults this tribunal. They are no more than raucous, ignorant, urban dwellers! And may I point out, I see no bouquets of flowers for Mrs. Keane. Why no public assemblies in support of her agony and embarrassment? (birds chirping) (tense music) - They told me I drove to the beach with Robbie and Frances to throw the baby off the cliff and into the sea. They shouted at me and punched me and were yelling and yelling at me. They said it would see Mountjoy before the night was out. They said I murdered the baby and that I would hang. - Just a moment, Mr. Flynn. - I've just been informed that Tom Walsh was an employee at a secondhand furniture shop as a young lad. He immigrated to America 17 years ago where he still resides. So we must conclude that there is no link in this case between Tom Walsh and Miss Flynn. (people chattering) (slow paced music) (cow mooing) - Hey. - Shh, she's gone down. She cried for a while. (slow paced music) (Patsy sighs) - The door! Do ya never think of closing that door? (door slams) It's closed now! You happy Patsy? - Frances, Frances, Frances! Help me. It's all right Robbie, just take your coat off. She's fine, she's fine. - Find Ger. - [Catherine] Take off your coat, go on. Take off your coat, she's fine. Here. There ya are, sip that down. (gentle music) (people shouting) - [Pat] Thank you very much for your support. Thank you. Thanks. - Thank you. - Judge, I felt I should advise you that Patsy Kerrigan is no longer able to attend the hearings. - Is that how it is Mr. Mann? - And on whose assessment was this decision arrived at? - She's been admitted to Saint Rita's General Hospital. - That's very convenient for your client Mr. Mann. So you're telling me are you, that Patsy Kerrigan won't be able to attend my hearing again? - Yes judge, she's far too ill. The family are withholding permission for Patsy to appear in court. - Really? And would you be responsible for orchestrating this rabble that's attending this hearing, Mr. Mann? (people shouting) - [Court Steward] All rise. - Good morning. Today I intend to take evidence from Patsy Kerrigan, even though the Flynn family are withholding permission. It's nonsense. She's a key witness in this hearing. Therefore, I'll be transferring this hearing to Patsy's hospital bed, immediately. Now, let's see how ill she really is, shall we? (people chattering) - Can you believe it? She's too ill for all this? These two here, look at them, ridiculous! - Now, Patsy Kerrigan, in your own words, did you help Sarah break the waters? Is that right? - Yes. - [Judge] And you helped Sarah with the baby that night? Is that right? - [Patsy] Yes. - [Judge] And you helped cut the cord? Is that right Patsy? - I took the scissors and cut it, I just cut it. - And you broke the waters? - No, I didn't do that. - Tell me about breaking the waters, Patsy. Can you remember now whether or not you did break the waters? - No. - But before I think you said you may have helped to break the waters. - That's right, I did. I broke the waters. - There speaks the truth. - So you remember - [Martin] about the waters now. - No wonder they tried to keep us from hearing Patsy's testimony. - That you did help to break them? - Yes. - Had the waters burst when you first saw Sarah? - Yes they had I suppose. - Thank you, Miss Kerrigan. - This is getting ridiculous now. If they were to ask Patsy, if there are giraffes on the farm, she'd say yes, there are help to Sarah. She must be confusing seeing Una being born, with this new baby. (gentle music) - [Judge] Mr. Horgan, your witness. - So you proceeded to give birth. Can you tell the tribunal where you were at that particular time? - I was (clears throat) outside a bit down from the house. - And what were you able to do about the umbilical cord? - I pulled at it and then it broke. - Was the child alive? - I don't think so. - What did you do with the child, if the cord broke? - I left it there, and then I went back to the house. - You left it there, on the ground? Not sure if it was dead or alive. And what happened to you next? (tense music) - [Sarah] I was bleeding. - Bleeding from the vaginal region? - Sarah Flynn, thank you. (slow paced music) Mr. Horgan. We'll take a break there. (people chattering) - [Callaghan] This family had a hand in the death of the baby. - I really think you need to show a little more restraint when it comes to that young woman. - Yes Judge. (gentle music) - The Judge, he's swimming against the tide in this case, Pat. I mean, calling Patsy in at her age. Jesus. - This is just today. - [Denny] Galway. - Donegal. - Dublin. - Leitrim. - [Denny] Who would have expected that. - They're coming in from all over the place. You know, this whole thing has got a life of its own. There are coaches heading from Limerick, the Midlands, Dublin, I'm told. - [Catherine] Father. - Mrs. Flynn is it? - [Catherine] That's right. - Mrs. Flynn, I believe you're looking for a priest to come and conduct a blessing. - Father come in. - Mrs. Flynn, I can't. I can't cross the threshold unless you first agree you can't tell a soul about my visit. And please don't ask me my name. And I can't say who asked me to call. - All right. (people shouting) (slow paced music) (doors banging) - Deal with that Gards. - [Court Steward] All rise! (people shouting) - You're telling me that you were not in love with Paudi Keane the first time you had sexual intercourse with him? - Yes. Yes. - And when was the first time you had sex with Paudi Keane? - The first time that he drove me home. - And you admit that you were not in love with him? Yet you still allowed him to have sexual intercourse with you? - Yes. - Don't you think your actions were selfish and have been selfish all the way down the line? - I suppose so. - Do you not have any feelings or regard for Mrs. Anne Keane? Paudi's wife? - Paudi had told me that he was unhappy and that one day he'd eventually make a home with me. - Would you care to define eventually? - Never. (Sarah cries) Never I suppose. - Thank you, Miss Flynn. You may step down. (women shouting) - [Women] Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! - I can't believe the way they managed to clean up that house after the murder. I mean, there wasn't a trace. - [O'Shea] I'd still fight for redoing the blood tests. - In factual terms, the case against the family, it makes for compelling reading. - For a shy rural family, they know how to play the press and the media. - [People] Shame, shame, shame! - Let's go back to that awful, terrible night when you gave birth the second time in the farmhouse. Your attitude wasn't the same as to the first pregnancy, was it? - Yes, it was. - No doctors, no hospital visits, no 13 weeks checkup. Why was that? - I was fine. I didn't take my maternity leave because I didn't intend on coming back to work after the baby was born. I wanted to get a flat in town for me and the children. - You had no intention of allowing that child to be alive in this world after it left your body, did you? Well, did you? - That's not true. No. - [Horgan] And that is the reason why there were no doctors, no leave, no nurse. You knew this child was going to die. - No. - You told the Limerick psychiatrist, Dr. Dermot Hehir, "I panicked and killed the baby" "by putting my hands on its neck." Is that what happened? - But I had to pull him out by the neck. He was stuck! - [Horgan] You must've known you were killing your own baby? - No, I didn't. I'd never harm him! - You knew that he was not doing him any good. - I didn't know what I was doing. - Why did you not ask Ger or Robin to drive you to hospital on the night when you felt unwell before giving birth? Why? Because you didn't want the baby. - I wanted the baby. - What did you do to show that you wanted the baby? - Nothing. Please, may I, can I leave? Pat, please. - I put it to you, that you did have twins that night. Having delivered in the field you thought all your troubles were over. And then you suddenly discovered you were about to produce again in the bedroom. You called Patsy Kerrigan, an experienced nurse, but in your fever and temporary lunatic state, when the baby appeared, you took a knife and stabbed the baby exactly as you described in your original statement. - That's all untrue. Pat, please? - Not only were you - [Horgan] not satisfied with stabbing the baby, but you beat it across the skull with a bath brush to ensure it was dead. - But that wasn't my baby! - What kind of the Catholic attitude is this? To leave a baby somewhere out in the land? Do you not think it should be baptized? - You must do something. Anything, break his stride! Horgan's having it all his own way! - Decency of a coffin and a consecrated grave. - The judge is letting him - [Pat] walk all over her, come on! - Judge, my client is under considerable stress. She needs a break to compose herself. - [Judge] But she'll have to remain under stress this morning, and she'll have to do the best she can. If I rise now, I'll be rising every five minutes. What's better, hm? Sooner or later? The sooner we're done with her, the better for her, and for us. - She needs a toilet break. - What? - She needs a toilet break. - Please? - Very well. (people chattering) - Why were you frightened? - I was in the barracks. We'd never been in trouble before. I made a statement to the detectives, but they made parts of it up and they told me I'd never go home again. - [Horgan] What is his job? - He's the judge. - [Horgan] What is he attempting to do? - I don't know. - You do know. And various accounts have been given by you and your family of what happened. - Yes. - So what is the judge attempting to do? - Find the truth. - Are you assisting him with this? - Yes. - [Horgan] By telling the truth. - Yes. - You took it out at the beginning of your evidence. Do you remember that? - Yes. - [Horgan] Do you know what the oath is? - No. - Good morning. I am Louise Murphy, I'm a forensic scientist and I've been called here today by the Gardai. - Good morning, Ms. Murphy. - Good morning. - [Officer] Will you sign in here? - Thank you. The blood was gathered from the lung tissue from the infant found on the beach, and blood was also taken from Sarah Flynn's baby. I can confirm that the infant came up as blood group A, the other baby was blood group O. Sarah Flynn has group O, as does Paudi Keane. These tests were repeated over three occasions and the results were consistent. - Jesus. - The forensic analysis showed that none of the material taken from Sarah Flynn's bedroom, where the Guardi asserts that her baby was born showed any traces of blood group A, even on the bloodstained night dress. The only blood group in evidence was Sarah Flynn's own O group. - We've been assuming that the stabbed baby we found on the beach is the second Flynn baby. Now maybe the baby they've admitted to killing and throwing in the sea is yet to come ashore. I was told it could take months. (slow paced music) (people chattering) (door slams) - There's been much speculation as to where in the house or on the land this baby was born, murdered and then concealed. I have therefore decided that I need to visit this particular location. The remainder of this hearing today will be conducted from the Flynn farm. (tense music) (people chattering) - Right then. Here we are. Judge, this is where the baby was found. It was discovered by Frances Flynn. (camera shutters) (woman humming) (gentle music) (water pouring) - I will be holding a press conference concerning my findings on this hearing tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM sharp. (Sarah sighs) (tense gentle music) (people chattering) (woman humming) (gentle music) This tribunals lasted for 86 days, 77 of which were spent taking evidence. There were 107 witnesses and over 61,000 questions asked, having made a careful study of all the evidence, here are my initial conclusions. I will of course, be submitting the full report to the Minister for Justice for Ireland in due course. Sarah Flynn is cleared of all murder charges, but the case of the murder of the unidentified body found on the beach is still to be solved. For the Gardai, the very strong suspicions justified by the weight of evidence available at the time was that Sarah Flynn was the mother and responsible for the death of the aforementioned case. This is now known not to be the case. I acknowledge that despite the presence of seven detectives from the murder squad, the investigation was carried out in a slip shot manner. They failed to face up to the level of contradictory evidence. (woman humming) (gentle music) (people cheering) - There was no evidence of any assaults or any physical abuse of any member of the Flynn family by any member of the Gardai. The Gardai search of the Flynn farm was deplorably inadequate, and the failure to find the baby was inexcusable. This added to the unwelcomed delay in the case. - [Woman] Woo, well done! - [Woman] Dear Sarah, I am writing to you because I had a baby as you did. I was on my own too. - Dear Sarah Flynn, - I never had anyone - I had a stillborn baby. - To help me. When my baby came, the cord broke on it's own. So I know you never - I was alone and scared. - Needed to cut your cord. - So I can feel how you felt. I followed you. - Dear Sarah, - [Woman] I may be of no use at this late stage, or prove anything. - I'm sure you did your best. To help the baby. - Doesn't it show that despite - [Woman] what some of the experts have said in the evidence. - I wanted to write to say. - [Woman] Babies can arrive suddenly. The cord can snap. - [Woman] I hope you will be okay, and that your little girl is a comfort to you.
