You tell her what I told you. OK? I understand. I'm not stupid. -Hello -Hello, can I speak to Julie please? Yes, it's me So, you don't know who I am I call you from a guy who likes you. He would like to know if you want to go out with someone in your school? Is this a joke? No, it's not a joke. Just tell me if you're in love with someone. But who is this boy? I can't tell you. Are you in love with someone? No! I don't know who you are. It doesn't matter, don't worry. So, you're in love with who? Do you want me to read you my personal diary? Who is this boy? Is it Antoine? No, I won't tell you, It's not Antoine. So, it's Hugo? No. Is it... Jonathan? Jonathan Velasquese? My brother's classmate? What to tell her? Are you stupid? Tell her there's a ring at the door and hang up. No, it's weird. Say it! Sorry, someone's ringing at the door. I have to go. OK. You're hurting me! You're a slut! You're mad! Go fuck your mother, bitch! There are people spending their lives trying to find the right person. For me, at 13, I had chosen. It would be Julie, no one else. She was the most popular girl at school. And for me, as for the others she was the most inaccessible. Everyone wondered if he had a chance with her and I knew where to find the answer. I still hadn't the courage to speak to her. But there was still a hope. In 3 days, Julie was having her birthday party. I wasn't invited, but Julie had a brother Charles, nicknamed 'the Ginger'. He could invite who he wanted, and we were mates... At least, the first three weeks of school. In October I accused him of stealing my calculator. It's not like at your home, where your parents have criminal records. We're leaving! Fuck you old man! Jonathan, hurry up! Shut up! Thank God, I have pretended to forgive him, but did he put aside what happened? I had no chance to be in the guest list, luckily one thing saved me. Charles, who was very lonely had no other friends except me. Take this. No, no thanks. I don't use it. Ok, but no thanks. Take it! Well, thank you. Yesterday, I saw your mum in the supermarket. So, you got a new boyfriend? Fuck off bitch. Ginger! Don't talk of my mum like that! She's ugly, very, very ugly! Sorry, I was with my mother. It doesn't matter, I must go. No, not now. I don't have choice. But you just arrived. My mum is waiting me. I invited you, you can stay. See you later. Hi. Are you okay? Yes. Charles isn't here. Really? Yes. Can I wait for him here? Do you know when he is coming back? He's coming in a while. Ok, come in. Go ahead, do it! Wait, wait. How are you? Okay... Let me explain. Do you promise not to tell anyone if I tell you something? Yes, go on. Did your sister told you she lost her diary? No. Are you sure? I don't know. Why? Did you take it? Yeah, I did. Really? Is this your room? Well... yes. Is it your diary? No. You know, I did't open it. I don't know what's inside. I don't care, it's not mine. Do what you want! I know, but I say that for your sister. I did't open it. I don't know what's inside. FFFFFUUUU W U NO Working?
