What are you writing in such a hurry? - Imposition. - What? Imposition. So you aren't that studious I presume? One would think different. You being well-dressed and all. If you have any doubts, ask me. I am an old 10th standard. By the way, on what is the imposition? Speed and Velocity. Imposition on speed? Then you tell me. What do you mean by speed? You don't know what speed means? When we are moving fast.. Some bystander will scream, to whose bloody funeral are you off to. Now that is speed. Well, that is not what it means. What is the equation of speed? Speed is equal to? I'll tell you. What is the distance from here to Thalassery? To Thalassery, it's somewehere around 43 to 45 km. How long will it take for you to get there? If we are moving at 40 km per hour. Somewhere around 45 min to 1 hour The 40 you mentioned earlier. Now that's your speed. So what you did there was. You divided distance with time. So speed is equal to distance traveled by time. Understood? That's it So, I knew that. If you knew all this. How did you get the imposition? I forgot when Miss asked me unexpectedly. Which Miss was it? Her name is Sheena. She's also my class teacher. Is this Miss on Whatsapp? Why? Does she? Why? Then there's no need of writing all this down. Just copy/ paste and message her. Just speed up. I'm already late Fast right? Will get you there in a jiffy. Hey!

Nowadays we can't drive safely on these roads. Because of these idiots. Do you have a blue pen with you? I had a new Lexi pen with me.

From there I will keep climbing till I come around.. the 6th meter.. It becomes 6 minutes Then... I will climb up 2 more metres. My height is around 1 to 1.5 meter So... If I extend my hands Can't I simply grab the flag? Arun, didn't you understand my question? Yes Miss Did I ever mention height in my question? Miss my... name was mentioned. Arun... So then I can grab the flag right? You are asking me that? Are you trying to be oversmart? You don't teach me... Miss, I just said what was on my mind. Enough. Are you trying to insult me? Nonsense! I have never seen a student so disrespectful You don't even know the definition of speed. Do you? If you don't show me that imposition by evening. You know those upcoming mid-terms? You won't be writing that. Not only Physics. I won't let you write any of them. Understand? Vikas. Rub the board. Yes Mam. - Sumi, are you on Tinder. - No. Thought I saw you there.

We are planning a programme in respect of Dr. Kalam's birthday. I just wanted to discuss what we finalized. The programme is mainly for students from 1st to 10th standard. Why are you staring at me like this? You also know what happened right? You and your toilet selfie. If I don't get my phone I'll stab your eye with a compass. Don't get violent. Don't worry, relax. I have some groundnuts in my bag. You want some? Groundnuts! I might call you something else. You dare use your tongue to curse me. Not only my tongue, I might use my fist and foot. You want to see Perunthacha? Peruntachan? Are you hearing any of this? I was going for that Justin Barber style and this guy is.. If you have any idea, tell us. Every student is granted permission to stick charts in their classroom. They should take it down the next day themselves. Don't tell me to do that. Our principal will share the rest with you. We are helpless till the meeting is over. I know everyone has to be some place. I regret to have set this meeting on such a day. There won't be any bus if we are late. Just get me my phone. Don't shout. He's right Anna. He won't get any bus.. You will get the bus or I'll drop you. Who is this kid? I think that's Sheena Miss's daughter She does look like her. I have an idea. It may or may not work. What? We should tell this kid to go in and ask Sheena Miss about his imposition.. and P.T Sir about his mobile. Anna.. We are already in trouble. There will be no issue. Trust me. Anna, don't You don't worry, I'll deal with it. - Come here. - Me? Yes. Come. Don't do or say anything stupid when I'm talking to her. Understood? What? What's your name? Jesna. Can you help me? You know P.T. Sir standing inside right? You should ask him one thing. That this idiot here, brought a phone in the morning. P.T. Sir took it. He said he will give it back by evening. So you should go in and ask him. If he can give the phone back after the meeting? Then there's this thing about our imposition. You should also ask about the imposition. To Sheena Miss. Your mother. About when to submit the imposition. Will you ask? Don't get it wrong. Okay? Deal? Deal Ok, go Sir, those boys asked if you can give their mobile back? Which boys? There. Don't worry about it. Tell him to meet me personally on Monday. Mummy! Those boys asked about the imposition. Who? There. What imposition does he have? I must have forgotten. Tell him to submit on Monday. Go What did P.T. Sir say? He said you can have the mobile on Monday. So that matter is solved. What did your mother say? She said that she must have forgot about you.. and you can submit it on Monday Whose? his. Me? Why should I submit imposition? I told him then itself, don't do this. Super idea This won't be over anytime soon. As always Anymore help? Nothing more. This was more than enough. You can go I had to go to that G.G. Tailors. I had given a saree for stitching. It's for a reception tomorrow. You should have done it earlier. But no one expected this hartal. We'll submit it together. If I don't submit this today they won't let me write the exams. Nothing like that will happen. Who is she to prevent you from taking the exams? Come with me. I'll drop you. Anna, me too. Please. Anna? You called me something else before? Triples isn't possible. Anna, please... It's already late. I won't get any bus. Please. Should reach there before the shop closes. Not only that, Jessu is staying with her dad today. And never utter a word about the mobile again. Understand? You go and take the mobile from P.T. Sir. Our relation ends here. Perunthachan? - Anna can I come? - No need Where's the bike Anna? My cousins shop is on the way I'm going there anyway. Let Jessu get down there with me. Tell your husband to come and pick her from there. That's a good idea. That's enough.

This is why we shouldn't help anyone these days. You are the one who brought her in. Now who knows it was your auto that hit her. Don't talk to me like this. I'm a God fearing auto driver.

Fill this. - Enough? - Phone Number Her stomach is bloated. Hello sir, this is the duty MO calling from casualty. We have a RTA case, 6 year old girl. Yes, 6 years old. Now the patient is unconscious. There's a B.P. fall. Plus the abdominal distension is slowly rising. No sir, she was okay when she came in. I myself checked the vitals. The vitals were stable. It felt like an Intra Abdominal Hemorrhage to me. Yes, the emergency laparotomy is done. I have shared the details at the theater. Yes sir, you just come directly to the theater. You didn't leave yet? Why are you following me? I'm not sitting on your lap or anything. Come, I'll let you do that too Why do you keep staring at me? Didn't you get any other ride? I tell fortunes. I tell fortunes looking at faces. Are you a palmist? Son, are you Hindu? Can't you read my fortune and tell? Show me your hands. Why? Not only this life, I will also tell you about your past life. Who was I in my past life? St. George George.. St. George... Me? Yes. Then who was I lady? That dragon. If you don't want to die by my hands, go sit somewhere else. What a disturbance. Let's go. There's internal bleeding in the kid's stomach Doctor said she needs surgery. They are saying it should start as soon as possible. It's a critical situation There's an injury in her stomach from the accident. We have informed the surgeon and he's on the way. But that's not the problem now. Then? We need a lot of blood for the surgery. We need atleast 3 units of A- blood. We can't start the surgery without leveling the blood pressure. What should we do about that? You should arrange 2 units of blood immediately. - Blood... We must arrange? - Yes. On hartal day, you took my information for admitting that kid. Now you are saying she needs blood and we must arrange that. Didn't you hear about the new law? Let me ask this Doesn't hospital require to have stock of these blood groups? There is only 1 unit of A- blood in our blood bank. And like I said the kid needs 3 unit. You have no choice but to arrange it from somewhere. Are you A- ? Mine is not A negative. I have other things to do. Come lets go. Are you coming or should I go? Brother please. Isn't O group a universal donor? So can't we do that? We already have O- group. But we can't use that. Why not? After AB- blood group the most rarest is the O- blood group. Not only that, it's already booked for an operation at 9 tomorrow. This A- blood group isn't that rare. If you try you will get it from somewhere close by. Nurse, it's hartal today. There won't be a single person outside. Where will we go and ask? You can just say whatever you want. What will we do now? You want A- blood right? No need. It's a waste of time Is your group A- ? Not mine. There are many people I know close by. Within 2km itself. In this panchayat. If you come with me I'll show them to you personally. There's nothing more to think about. Since she's that sure, we should go with her. I won't take the auto without knowing who or what she is. Diesel is low in the auto. Please brother. I know this teacher very well. If your problem is money. I'll help you. Please. Not money. Then what's the problem? There's no one else to help me. Who did you say needed the blood? Can't you tell by looking at his fortune? It's not because I don't know Then? This fortune telling and all is a scientific. It isn't some auto's gear to use at our will. Auto's what? Believe if you want to. Don't teach me about beliefs. Please, instead of quarreling with each other think about a way to find a person with A- blood. - We are calling from the Thaluk hospital. - Hello - Isn't this Santosh? - Yes. Aren't you the one that admitted that accident case of Jesna. We aren't able to contact the number on the I.D. card you gave. It isn't clear. Do you have any other number? We too have the same number. They are saying they don't know any other number. No problem. Just arrange the blood donor. We'll call you if there is anything else. Ok. We will arrange. Isn't it clear. Give it to me. Give it.. No wonder. This last digit isn't clear. One second. If you use this you can see it much better. No need for that. All we need to do is use our hand and pull it like this to enlarge. Is this 5 or 6? Just check it. What do you think this is? Isn't that 8? It feels like 8 to me too. Sure I'll try calling one of the three. If you have any book or paper please give it to me. Check, if this is enough. Enough It's showing some Meera in Truecaller. Meera? A lady right? Don't call any Meera and all. There's only Rs.6 balance. Let me try with 6. It's showing Nizam. I think it's her father, talk to him. You do it yourself Please, call Take this. It's her father itself. He said it will take hm around 30 min to reach the hospital. Someone gave him wrong information and he went to Anjarakandy Medical College. Some people are like that. They just say something made up even if they don't know anything. Son, who is that kid to you? Is there anyone who knows about blood donors in your knowledge. I don't know much about people who give blood. but I know some who take blood. The goons in my area. Stop joking around. Aren't there Whatsapp groups? There are numbers of donors in them Right, Whatsapp? If the blood is needed at Trivandrum. You will get the number of someone from Kasaragod. There's no use checking that on Hartal A - I have a friend, let me try calling him. Manoj, it's me Santosh. - What is it? - Where are you now? I hope you are not driving during Hartal. I called to ask you something. If it's about Georgekutty, you already know that I'm broke. It's not about that. Your blood is A- right? Yes. I need some blood urgently for an accident case. Just tell me where you are and I'll come there. I was actually celebrating hartal. Had a peg or two. So I think till 24 hours.. 48... 48... No, 48 hours till I can donate blood. Right? Does anyone you know have A- blood? There is someone but he's drunk and out of it. I'll call you back if there is someone else. Okay. You didn't get it, right? No. Why? Who is this kid to you? My teacher's daughter. Why? What kind of place is this, isn't it? Filled with selfish people. Don't waste your time on others in a place like that. Why do you think everyone is like that? Not that.. We are surrounded by people who have no gratitude even after you do everything you can. Sometimes God is also the same. But can we give up that easily? That is why, I tagged along with God and got out there with my bird fortune telling. Oh! so you do bird fortune telling? And where is the bird? I had one. For some years. How old is it? Once I opened the cage. She flew to Germany. To Germany? - The gates closed. - I can see that. Isn't that Binoy? What? Binoy! Stop there. I'm coming with you. Stay there. Come. Move your legs. What about the blood? If you go forward to around 1.5 to 2 km's from here. Turn east. and as you go around 300 metres. You can see a gate with grape vines growing on it. Thekuparambil House. Both the people living there are A- Go and say my name there. T.P. Annamma Then only will they know. If I come with you.. There will be two extra people to take from there. There won't be any space left in the auto. If I go with him, I can reach my doorsteps. You guys leave.Go. I will call and inform them. Come fast. I'm coming. Annamma? Was she christian? Yes. I saw a rosary in her bag. Let this be here. I have to give you credit. How did you arrange this auto during hartal. I'll tell you later. Haven't seen them around. Who are they? I have no idea. I asked for a lift and they stopped. I got in and reached here safely. - Let's go. - Nice. I have contacted the hospital. The surgeon is here. So.. Don't panic. Drive safe. Yeah, right. Panic. Lorry! 2 km is over. Did you see the turn she said? She said east right? East right? Not so good at Malayalam? It's an ancestral method. Whats the use of telling kids in this generation. Doesn't it mean east? Yeast means something that Christians put in their pancakes. Not so good at English I guess. You think I'm riding this auto without knowing what east or west means. Don't go that way. It's dangerous. Why did you stop? He said not to go there. Some politicians might be causing trouble. There is no problem. Please lets just go. Things might get out of hand. Don't go searching for trouble. Time is moving. The surgery will start only after we reach. Please. Lets just go to the house she said. You listened to that freak right? That if we go way that it's dangerous. This auto is for hire. If anything happens, I'll be responsible. Nothing happened to us all during this hartal. Please. Thank God for that. Don't they say that God is in every nook and cranny. What if he came in that boy's form and told us not to there. It's trouble. Then was God having a snack when that kid was hit by a car? Are you an atheist? I don't know all that. Take that phone. I think it's the father of that kid. Take it and put it in loud speaker. Hello. Hello, is this Santosh? I'm Jesna's father. Heard that you were taking care of the blood. Did you get it? Don't worry. There's a guy. We are going to meet him. Will be back with him as quickly as possible. Thanks. This is very unfair. You see that turn? It could be the one. If you go a little more forward from there. I told you earlier right, Hindustan? If you go just a little further. There is also a mini Pakistan. We're trapped. It looks like trouble. moving forward isn't an option then. I think these people are from the party conducting hartal today. Some poor kids have fallen straight into their hands. Watch carefully, then don't tell me you didn't see or hear anything. Now what will we do? If they didn't see us. We must get away as soon as possible. We can try avoiding them somehow. Avoid? Let just go and ask them they will move away. Are you actually senseless or acting like one? I won't let you trash my auto for someone else's kid I'm going to turn the auto. Then I'll get down here. You can go. Sure, get down. See you in the newspaper tomorrow. If tomorrow something happens to the child you will be responsible. They have taken you number and address for police verification and you are the one who said he will get the blood for her. Not me? Not me. Whatever So you finally You help someone and this is what you get. It's not like that. Brother please. There is no else to help me in this situation. That's why. Are you not scared seeing all this because I am. I am scared but.. But we have to move past them somehow. It's not like we have any other choice. Get down. Get down. Get down and push. We can't start the auto or else they will hear us. You see that path to your right. Push it towards there. Push. You idiot. Push harder. Aren't you wearing a holy necklace? Don't teach me. Get in. Swami Sharanam - They haven't seen us right? - No - We are covered. - Are you sure. Don't make any noise. Understood? Get down. What should we do? For now let's hide the auto here somewhere. We'll put it there. Push. Enough. Get in. Life the sheet. This one right? We can see what's happening. Lift! Can you see? Isn't that Sudhi? You know him? Sudhi doesn't know Santosh. But Santosh know's Sudhi. He's JHS's local committee member. His bad reputation precedes him. What is it Vinod? Who are these people? Medical students. From Anjarakandy Medical College. Are you here on tour? [Background] And did you tour? Where are you all from? It's a bit far away. By far you mean? Doesn't this place have a name? Yes.

Sayed - What? - Sayed Iqbal So you are one of us? What I asked is.... Why?, Today.. On hartal Did you come out for a trip like this? - You have a drank a little, haven't you? - No. Sudhietta, don't you see they have drank till they changed into the color of brandy. - Not brandy.... Pepsi.. - What? - Is your father's color that of Pepsi? - No, daddy is Miranda. You bloody.... Who do you think you're talking to? Don't play with Sudhi! I'll beat you all up. He's drunk and has no idea what he's saying. Why are you scared of them? One of your father's friends.. has killed one of us Take your hands off me. You're spitting all over my face. What? You're spitting all over my face. Bloody...... Your!.... I don't think we can go through this way properly. What if we go that way? It's somewhat parallel to this road. If we go that way, maybe at some point we can get on the main road. - You take the auto. - The auto? I didn't carry it on my head. Get down and push. Should hide it out of sight. Keep an eye over there. It would be horrible if they ever catch us. Do one thing, finish everything here and come to the junction. Check this side, this side. Bash these people's car up! Stop your honking! You are cruising through the roads with this cursed one. What do you want? - Sheena, just listen to what they have to say. - Just get lost! Don't make an issue about it. I ripped my throat screaming. Give me that. What the hell is this? Madam, please come out You want to learn driving around when our friend has been murdered? Please let us go. My daughter is in the hospital after an accident. Your kid is in the hospital and mommy is still playing around in her car. These cheap cliched tricks get away on hartal won't work on us. We are telling the truth. Please let us go. Please. Why? Aren't there any men at home? To do all these? Aren't you a Muslim? If so? Pick the stones faster. Dear Showkath, don't be this lazy. Can't you wear your hijab? You are here to be the match sticks in hell. I have nothing to say to you. Sheena! This much pride. Throw those stones right away! - Last time I threw, it didn't break - Unais! Move! Allah! - Afsal Ikka - What happened? - There's a small problem. - What's your problem? The person I threw the stone at right now.. She teaches in my dad's school. Who? She? and moreover she also got hurt. Ikka, just avoid them, let them go, please. Couldn't you have said this earlier? But I just saw her now. Ikka, please ikka go take care of it. I'll take care of it. You go and arrange a bike by then. I have to go to that Jaram (Tomb). That Sudhi and team might be around. Whatever happens, their flag shouldn't be hoisted today. I'll take care of that. I have already arranged some people to protect the Jaram (Tomb) Isn't that enough? That's enough. Tell them to stand in a circle around the Jaram (Tomb) - Ikka, just go - Yes, I'm going. - Unais! - Showkath! Eda ikka has to somewhere. Be ready with your bike. My god, now I've to ride the bike also. I can't do it. Just be ready you lazy idiot! He didn't have to raise his voice. Now what? I had already told you that she was a fraud. This is why they say to listen to someone with experience. What if we are in the wrong place? No. It's exactly how she said it would be. Grape vines. Thekumparambil House. Now don't waste time here. Let's go. What I imagined, was the truth. and that is exactly what is happening now. Come, get in! That was unexpected of. Pull it... Pull it down - All I have to do is, pull this right? - Yeah! It's all fate. Might be that the kid was only supposed to live this long. There is someone name God. He has written everything. And it will happen accordingly. We cannot change or rewrite it or anything.. Isn't there something we can do before we hand everything over to God? He's testing us. It's different with each person. Unfortunately it got of hand with the kid. Like what we say, its written on our head. Fate. That's all. Maybe that's why you left this much space on your head Don't talk like a cheap rationalist when I'm being serious here. This is what I don't like, pull the sheet down. The rain is getting in. Pull it down. There's a lady there. Take the auto there. Trouble seems to find me... Let's go, please. Take that umbrella. This one right? Open it. You are getting me all wet. Hold it properly. Give it here. I'll hold it. One minute.. Who is it? What? Isn't there anyone in that house? Are you from Germany? Germany? Why? They went to Germany long back.

Or does anyone in the house have A- blood group? No. My husbands is A+ same as my child. - I haven't checked it yet. - Why? When they went to treat Gayathri back then they found out she had blood cancer. After that I'm scared. Gayathri, Who's that? The lead of Magara Gayathri. That is why her Midhun left her. Serial. I need my husband. Will anyone else close by have it? A kid had an accident. It's urgent. Like that? Then 4 kms from here there is a junction There will be some people there. Ask them. Ok, thank you. Remember its hartal today. There won't be A single shop won't be open today and the diesel is also almost over. I filled the whole tank full of diesel yesterday. I had no idea Al this will happen. Now that junction is the only option left. Please, don't say no. Let's just go and see. I'll take the auto but I need to know one thing. If I'm being reasonable or are you? The road's blocked. The road's blocked. Will it be a problem? The road is under construction. Lets put that away. Make it fast. I can't manage it alone. - Great. - Come. Watching your eagerness I thought you would actually do something. I'll grab this side. You take the other side. Lift it. This is filled with water. Will surely get infested with mosquitoes. Keep it aside. You start the auto. I'll take care of this. Watch your legs. Lets go. You are happy now. Diesel is over. Don't do this to me. Do what? As if I drank all the diesel. Try restarting again. I'm serious. The diesel is over. When we turn the bike on its sides for petrol. Auto must have something of that sort. You want me to turn over the auto? Not like that. Like when we pull down the bike on its side. Auto's might have something like that. The auto won't move forward with out diesel. These is all fate. The more we move forward. It's showing us more and more problems. Think about it. First.. That freak kid. Then that woman. Here the road was blocked and now no diesel. Problems over problems. Hello. I'm talking to you. Which model is this auto? It's a good model. Not that. What's the brand? Amme Narayana. It's written on it. Not that. What's the name of this model? Mahendra Alpha Give me that mobile. Give. I'm telling you again. This is all fate. You have net? Yes. But don't finish up the data. It's a three day plan. The English for how to start an auto without diesel? Why auto's diesel is not here? Tell. You will get me wrong too. But why? Pick that back seat up. What? - Pick that seat in the back. - Why? Don't wreck it. I'll do it. - Where is this lift bump. - I'll show you. You open this. - Inside this? - Then where did you think it was? Which of these is the lift bump? The one you see under this. Catch this. What are you going to do? There is a science in this. In this? If we push the lift bump like this. Any leftover diesel will consolidate and get into the tank. What? The diesel will go into the tank. That's it. And it says it might go around 1 to 1.4 km. Yeah. Right. Why haven't I heard about this. Let's try. You start the auto. I don't think it will work. Just try starting. It's not starting. Try once again. It's not starting. Once more. What am I supposed to do? Started right? I told you right. Okay. Come. Get in before this gets over. The car started right? Good sign. Now straight to the junction. Let's go. How much? Rs. 460 Rs. 460 Here's Rs. 500 Keep the change. Use it against my previous debt. You have won the lottery. Rs. 500 business on hartal day. Is this bread expired? Is anyone buying all these? Don't check the date. It's fresh. Just arrived the day before yesterday. No chance of fungal infection. No fungus will ever dare get into this Then? Our guys have had their food, right? Now close the shop. It's hartal. Don't be too late. Stop! Stop! Stop. Today is hartal. You won't get an auto if you keep screaming 'Autokaara.' Pack up and leave as soon as possible. Fast. Okay. Leave. Sudhietta. That Bineesh is being a little feisty. He's saying that he won't close the shop. If we say, close the shop. You close the shop. Don't try to scare me like you do others. Bineesh! Don't talk on the confidence of someone who stepped in yesterday. Close the shop and go home! Or what will you do? We will do whatever is needed to be done. You won't do a thing. What is it Bineesh? What's your problem? Look around. All the shops are closed. The why you are the only one being disobedient. I won't close the shop Sudhietta. I have trouble agreeing with this unreasonable hartal you are conducting. Whether you agree or not. That comes later. If we say, close the shop. You close the shop. Don't play your drama in front of these people. You know I have always hated these kind of conversations. Close the shop and get the keys. Won't happen Sudhietta. What good does hartal bring to this country? How many times have I complained to you about this gutter. Everytime a car passes here. All these dirt are splattered on my mirror. And here you are trying to close my shop. Stop blabbering and get lost. Who are you to kick me out? You dog. You bloody... Do we look like people who came to measure the dirt on your window? This is a democratic country. When a person with authority speaks. You listen. Understand? you bloody. Beat him up. Destroy everything in the shop. You were asking for it. Beat him up! Pig. Diesel is over. Now do what you want. What if we ask these guys? Who? I'm out. There are a lot of people there. Someone will have it. Don't create any trouble. Can't you see all the fight and screaming? I'll ask them. Never say I didn't warn you. Don't create any trouble. Enough. Enough. Stop. Move. He will die. When Hassan and his gang demanded a mosque next to this jaram (tomb). We were the only ones to speak or stand against it. If then that mosque had been built. They would have laid their foundation on top of your shop. These people who only represent 40 houses here. would have multiplied t0 400 or 500 and rose to power. You run this shop and sleep at your home peacefully. because of our charity. This hartal was proclaimed by J.H.S. No one will open their shop today. Take your mic and your belongings and leave. We are leaving. Take it and leave. Can't you understand? There are enough people here for a Kargil War. Their flag has been raised as imagined. Where are our boys? I'll call you now. Maybe they are late. Is this school to come late? Idiots. What will we do now? What if we throw some stones at them? Don't be a stupid. But that's all you have taught us. If you throw two they will throw thirty back. For now you just shut up and follow me. I have an idea. - There are only two of you? - Why? Isn't that enough? By each day your members count seem to be coming down. What happened? You guys are the ones trying to kick us out. We're harmless. You just let us be. You? harmless teams? Everyone knows those stories of your cutting and stitching. Our party isn't as disgusting as yours. What decent people. Come. Showkath, measure it. How long? - Thirteen feet. - Then remove it. Take your hands off the flag. Hassan! This is our flag. This flag will fly right here. Maybe in the past. Now this is at our place. Now if any flag will be hoisted here. It will be I.D.F's. What? Your place? Remember the land kept aside for the jaram (Tomb). This flag is in it. You go and inspect the documents. Hello.. Sir... Yes, I understood. Don't play games Hassa. Your jaram (tomb) is in the land which we gave off. Not for free right? You were paid generously. You! Raise the flag. Get lost. You remove it. Remove it. Please correct this. Okay. Who is this kid? Ok. Ok. I will call you sir. One minute. One minute. My name is Arun Jeevan. I'm studying in Plus One B at Benhill School. My class teacher Sheena Miss's daughter had an accident and.. is admitted in a nearby Thaluk Hospital. We need three units of A- blood to start the surgery. The hospital already has one unit. If there are two A- donors among you. Please come with me to the hospital. My blood is A- Thanks. Now we just need one more donor. What did you say that teachers name was? It's not for her. It's for her daughter. The daughters name is Jesna. Whatever, tell me what the teachers name was. Her name is Sheena. Her husband's name? Nizam. Nizam. Blood for Nizam and Hassan and all.. can be given later. For now , let your blood flow in your own body. I realized your agenda. You are challenging us. Yes. Use the same courage you had to remove our flag. You give it. No one needs your blood anyway. It's better for her to die than have your blood. Please stop! Why are you all talking like this? Would you say the same if it was someone close to you? What the child want isn't some Hindu, Christian or Muslims blood. but A- blood. Can you give that? No, we can't. Get lost. Come! Santoshetta. We have one there. Don't create any trouble We must convince him somehow. We have no other choice. Wait there. Who are you? We were the ones who got her to the hospital. Lets go. Oh! Now we'll take care of that kid. Which car hit her? We didn't see that. Something about you tells me it was your auto. Yes it was my auto that hit her. You have any problem with that? That kid is in the hospital because of your bloody hartal. Your two flags and your flag post. Fight each other and die. Sudhi I too am a believer A real believer. There is a flag in my mind too, India's flag. If you have any guts hoist that flag here. Let us see if we can help that child without your help. Come. Get lost. Come. Why did you tell them that we didn't need their help That kids father called me. They got 2 units of blood, now they need just 1 more. Where will we arrange that one unit blood from I'll give that one unit. My blood is A- Don't look at me like that. I had a sense like these people. I admit. You won, I lost. Come, get in the auto. Lets go. Come. Let's not waste time. Come. Where will you go without diesel? Hold on. Where are you off too? Today is hartal. On hartal day you are not allowed to use any motor vehicles. If you take this auto. It will lay here burning. Exactly. You cannot take the auto You were saying big dialogues there right? If you can, fly. Atleast you joined hands for one thing. I'm very happy. I'm not taking the auto anyway. There's no diesel in it. Shall I go then? Come. Are you planning to walk to the hospital? Aren't you getting any bright ideas in your head. - Walk. - Might get a ride. It's quite steep. For every way up there is a way down too. I just hope all this happens. Could have gone back in auto. - How? - Just said it to calm myself down. Can you pick me up? Walk, it's good for your cholesterol. If we will die breathless, then what cholesterol. From here its a downward slope. That's good. Wait. I have an idea. Come. - Jeevan Kumar! - Arun Jeevan. Whatever, I have an idea. If it works out we can get to the hospital for free. What idea? Why are you taking that? Come. Come. Just stand with me like an idiot. Aey! Aey! Stop! Don't you know you are not supposed to take any sort of vehicle on hartal? - We were learning to drive. - Are you trying to fool us? I had told him. He has a driving test the day after. That's why. I was learning to do an eight. Take your license I'm learning to do the eight for the driving license. - He hasn't got his license yet. - Then take your keys. Please. We will never repeat this. He's afraid to use a busy road. That's why. I was scared of bus and lorry since childhood. Then why are you taking the license? That's because.. There are certain custom right? - She know's - What? If the one on the bottom knows what that of the top doesn't. Wouldn't people call me Sasi? So for that you will just take your bike on hartal? Are you making fun of us? For now Sasi, you do one thing Drop us till the Thaluk hospital. Someone among us got stabbed, so we are in need of blood. I haven't filled petrol because its hartal. Reaching there is doubtful. You are teaching this Salman Khan to drive without petrol? Don't you have some common sense to fill petrol during hartal. Drop us there or else, I'll trash this bike. No need. We'll drop you. Let's go. We wont reach if we go straight. thereâ€™s a shortcut. Lets go that way. She has always been good with short cuts. Great. Come. - If we go that way we'll reach faster. - That's enough. - She will drive fast. - Great. How will we go with 4 people? Havenâ€™t you seen families going with 5-6 members on a bike? If there is unity.. You can sleep on a stick or where ever you want. But could we sit? Come on. Let's go. Be careful ok Is she your daughter? No, wife. Asha, we are four people. If you don't drive carefully you'll be on the handle and these 2 will be on my back. Just keep quiet. How is my idea? You should have told them the truth in the first place. See, just look into the mirror. The petrol is almost over. You are right. We have only enough to get back. We are back to being stranded. We have no idea about this route. Idiot. You said this was a short cut. Where have you taken us? What did you actually come to learn without any petrol or anything? Give me that ear. There's a reason for not filling the petrol to a full tank. What is that? In case if I do fill petrol to a full tank. What if she feels that she want to go outside. Like this, she will stay in my control. Then I too will be in control. You would've seen if she wasn't there for you. Stop! - Should I stop here? - This is enough. - Poor fellow, maybe he needs to take a leak. - Is here enough? The hospital is still too far from here. No. It's close. Thanks. Peace. Shall we go? Sure, be careful while you drive back. Don't get into more trouble. We can take the 8 and 16 and all at home. Let's go. Hospital is still too far from here. We could've gone with them. Let them go. If the petrol gets over how will they go back? Take your phone. Take it. What are you looking for? You see that tower? - At morning I got into your auto from there. - So? If we reach that tower somehow. - The you won't have to walk. - What? From there we can fly. Fly? Have you parked a helicopter there? Yes. Ok. How will we reach there, by swimming? There's no time and I'm already tired. I can't take another step. There's a science in this. Science again? You remember me writing the imposition in the morning Check this out. This is the tower. This is where we are. Both these roads are almost parallel. That means We are here and the tower is there. If we can take the shortest distance here. Then we can save maximum time. Which means velocity. - What is velocity? - What? What? Velocity means displacement by time. Understood? That's it. But there I don't see any path like that. We should make one. We'll run. Through the forest. Run? I haven't even eaten properly because of the fasting. Aren't you the one supposed to be getting to the top of Sabarimala. That is actually very simple. If you [ray from your heart you can climb up any mountain. Stop bragging and show if you can beat me there. Beat you? If you run upto there first then I'll accept whatever you say. But in case I reach there first. You'll have to accept everything I say. - Bet? Was that a bet? - Yes - Count. - Let's see. - You count. - Are you ready? - Yes - Don't forget to pray. - 1 - 2 I didn't say go Stop! Stop! My slippers. From first. I have to say. You are awesome. - What speed. - I told you then itself. Is this the helicopter you said? Yes. You got to be joking. Lets go. Wait. Let me drink some water first. There is no water in the pipe. That is panchayat's pipe. So? They just fixed it around 2-3 weeks back. There will be sound but no water. There is sound. Like this.. Is there any other way to reach a hospital with this displacement. Way? We have to reach there as soon as possible. Now it's your turn. There is a dried up irrigation canal. If we go that way. We'll reach behind the Thaluk Hospital. But it's a bit risky. It will all depend on how you drive and there isn't much high ground. - What do you say? - That's good. You get on. - Let's do it. - On this? - You stand on that - On this?! Put your foot on that. There is no seat and all. You can stand on that pipe. There. Get on - Grab my shoulders. - Is this enough? - Put your feet a bit behind. - Okay. Okay. - This doesn't have break okay? - It doesn't have breaks?! Bro, hold on okay. I am holding on. Keep playing. We too need Roger Federer's Bro, Roger Federer is in tennis. They were playing badminton. Playing opposite each other with a net in between, right? Both are same. So are both Volleyball and Tennis same? You ride properly. - Where do we give the blood? - Did you get the donor? Yes. Me. It's me. Come. Okay. Come. Bro! - I'll sit here. - I'll come back once it's done. - Are you Santosh? - Yes. I'm Nizam. Jesna's father. We talked on the phone. Thanks. Come fast. Don't waste time. - Let me give the blood then. - Okay Come fast. Lift your legs. Did you see an auto driver here, with a beard? I have seen many with beards I mean.. Wearing a lungi. A black one. Bearded man. Wearing a holy necklace to visit Sabarimala. No, I haven't seen him. Did you see an auto driver here? No I haven't. Sir I had a case and after that post OP rounds. Doctor! Did you see an auto driver here? With a beard and all.. Autodriver? He's wearing a holy necklace for a pilgrimage. - Doctor! - Sir, can I go? Okay. There was a discharge in the third ward. You! He brought that kid here. So it was him. Not just me. There was an autodriver. Santosh. He was the one who gave the kid blood. But I can't find him anywhere. He left. Nurse. Monitor the BP and temperature of those post OP patients. Don't forget to call me if there any issues, okay? Thank you sir. He might have left after her finished what he had to do. That child is out of critical stage. And yet why aren't you happy? But doctor. What happened to her actually? Internal bleeding. The blood vessel to the spleen was damaged. It got filled by blood. That's why her stomach bloated up. She needed three units of blood. Can I ask you a doubt doctor? Considering the blood here and Santosh's blood. It only makes 2 unit blood right? Where did you get the third unit from? Usually when accidents occur.. The first one hour is important. That is the one hour after the patient is brought to the hospital. We call that Golden Hour. Only after that, does it become critical, but.. even after today being hartal. Just because of the courage and responsibility you both showed. That child is alive today. You will become the school's hero now, right? Doctor, everyone at school calls me Nonsense. But you haven't said how you got the third unit yet. Come, I'll tell you. Human body.. It's something.. They say that the human body is the perfect picture of the human soul. He will only accept whats right for him. Else he will reject it. Works Hard. Defends. The answer to any question All is within himself. The one unit blood she needed was within her itself. The same blood from her internal bleeding. We.. Used that. Auto-transfusion. Now.. Is everything clear? Now that name you are being called. Cut off that 'Non' in that. What you did today was something sensible. What most tend not to do. Okay. See you then. Where are you going? - Came to see the patient. - Are you a relative? No, not a relative. just came to see her. You can't go in now. The doctor just warned us. Wait outside please. Okay. Did you see a cycle here? No. Did you find that bearded man? No. Did you lose anything else? No. They just keep coming.. asking about lost things. Why did you leave? Why did you do that? I searched for you everywhere. Then someone said you left. Can't you atleast tell me when you are leaving? You were in deep sleep after I was done. Then I thought to let you sleep. And hartal will be over after 6:30 night time. I took your cycle. Bought diesel. Thought I'll come back with the auto. You started worrying when you couldn't find the cycle, right? No. What if something had happened. Plus there is no breaks to this cycle. - You get in. - I'll take the cycle. This has no break, no light, nothing. Not just that. There is only streetlight here No problem. I have to go this way. You would have to go to and forth. I have enough diesel to get you home. Understand? Get in. It's ok.. Get in Where is your house? Velavana. The shops are open? Today's hartal was a joke. Why? The person who got stabbed wasn't IDF or JHS. It was some issue concerning land or something. So for that they stabbed each other and the political parties intervened and made it worse. It took till night for everyone to realize this. Nonsense. Your house is at Vellavana right? Yes. I have a close relative there. Who? Venu A.P. He owns a tea shop. You know him? Do I.. This Venu is the one.. who took my 'Wings of Fire' What is that? You know A.P.J.Abdul Kalam? It's his biography. I took it from the library because I wanted to read it. Before I completed it that Venu took it away from me. I can't go to school without that. Why did Venu take it? That's a long story. I'll tell you later. Why did you stop here? I'll be back within two minutes. I'm already late. My grandpa might be worried. Two minutes. I'll be quick. Was I late? Let's go. Why do you look so gloomy? Nothing. No problem right? No. Do you ride this cycle on the road? Why did you put it like that? You ride it through peoples shops? You are a bit reckless, right? I didn't give you any money, right? No. - This is all I have. - Rs. 100? Just tell me how much you need. I'll.. Give me a minute and I'll get it from my grandpa. or.. I'll arrange it somehow. For now take this. Keep it with you. There are many things in this world more valuable than money. You tried to settle me with Rs. 100? Let me settle a small debt too. What is this? Something you said you needed very urgently. That Venu.. Knows your grandpa very well. Which is why he never tells him about your recklessness. So I'll be on my way. Happy? Catch this. You won't give? Do you know the answer to those ticked questions? No. - Those are the ones I don't know. - Mam! Yes. Is this guy copying straight from the textbook? Paper. Which one's that? Why have you circled that answer? Flag post. Which? I explained about a flag post that day. I can't see. Give it to me. That's the only paper I have. That's okay, ask for another. Excuse me Miss. Mam. Arun needs a paper. Give it fast. Give it to me. Wait. What were you doing for the past 1.45 hour? You haven't even written down your roll number. Nonsense! Enough writing. What could you possibly do in the remaining 10 minutes. You should listen when you are in the class. Or you will have to sit like this. Where is my eraser. Atleast submit the impositions properly. I didn't give you the imposition for me to take back home. Enter the class only after you bring your parents. Understood? What's the use of taking this? You haven't written anything. Get out! Rasmina. Tie the paper. All of you time's almost up. Make it quick. Mam. Ajeesh. Tie the paper. I told you to tie it. Give it. Enough. You're getting out of hand. Just listen to me. - I don't want to talk to you again. - Please. - Please leave me alone. - What sort of mind you have. Miss, I'm fed up with this Arun. I haven't seen such a Nonsense in my life. His eyes are on others answer papers. My mouth has dried up putting some sense into him. How is Jesna? She is fine now. We shifted her to a medical college. There's Dr. Ramakrishnan there. He's Nizam's friend. Not just that, the cleanliness and service is better here. Is your husband at the hospital? He took 2 weeks leave just like that. Might be to impress me. Sometimes, such a shock treatment is necessary. To know ourselves and the people around us a little better. Yes. Okay then. Okay. The kid who got 1st rank is from our village. This news is of the welcoming party conducted by the Chorode Welfare Association. I'll come now. Name Rahul R. Yesterday the kid and father traveled in my auto. You are saying this for the third time. Are they still in your auto? Shouldnâ€™t we promote people like this. If they become a doctor or engineer in the future. It's a credit to us. That's all good Manoj. What we need isn't just a whole lot of Doctors or engineers.. But also some good human beings. Let the new generation grow like that. Right? Miss. I had finished the imposition that day itself. You had already left before I could hand it over. Miss. At home. All I have is an grandpa. As far as I can remember. I have only seen my grandpa. Can I bring him instead Miss? No. You can go. It's ok. Miss. Miss. It fell off from Jesna last Friday. Please give it to her. I had come to the hospital to give this to you. But you had already left. Okay Miss. Arun. Yes miss. You told me that day that you wouldnâ€™t take that long to grab the flag. Your logic is right. But Ajeesh Mathew and Vikas and others who sit next to you aren't the same height. Don't the 24 students in our class have 24 different heights? Then that question will have 24 answers, right? Which shouldn't happen, right? Complications of practical physics. To change that we generalize it. But it's true. When we generalize, we tend to miss something. For everyone, Then and now.. Results are important. Marks. Grades. Ranks. A syllabus to understand students like you We never had one in the first place, Arun. Keep this. Now what we need. Is a career of eternal goodness.. and wholesomeness in human conduct. Which is called righteousness, righteousness. As we say in India. Where there is righteousness in the heart. Where there is righteousness in the heart. There is beauty in the character. When there is beauty in the character There is harmony in the home. When there is harmony in the home. there is harmony when there is an order in the nation. When there is order in the nation, there is peace in the world. Achieve your destiny. I intend to. I will reach my expectations. Its a promise to myself. Whether problems occur or not. I have the courage. I'll play and win the game. and if I don't, I still live here Confidence won't brake now. As long as the sky won't part. I'm alone but all these paths are mine. Let people say what they want. why should those fear me? Who will remain behind and I speak the truth. Hey! my destiny, my dreams remain tough. They can try to stop me. I am capable. In this path. I'll make a difference. You wanna fly high and leave it intense. They say I'm wrong about my sense, so they call me nonsense. They call me Nonsense! We make it. We know it. We're making the effort! Yo! listen. I might be just so close but then get rolled off the hill but, I ain't gonna stay here. I'll pick myself up and move it like Jack and Jill. Oh my God! Is what you'll say when you see me on my flying wheels. Yes, I can fly with this, so call me Superman, Call me the Man of Steel. Wicked is, what they say when they see me do a back flip. I'ma do a 360 with a bunny hop and tail whip. I'ma take over the world. Like an alien cause this is my space ship. So don't you try to mess with me cause you won't die in peace if I say RIP. Alright.
