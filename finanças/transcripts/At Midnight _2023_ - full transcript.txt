No! Dr. Thunder. Oh! Oh! Your power! It's gone. - How do you feel? - I'm scared. Don't you burn out on me. Light a flame! I'm trying! No! Wow! What a clap, guys! We are here with the stars of "Super Society". Adam Clark and his girlfriend, Firephina. Adam, a Golden Globe, not to mention an Oscar nom. First I just want to say, I love this guy. Is he not the best? - He really is. You are the best. - You're the best. - No, you're the best. - You're the best. Yes. Yes. Um... I love the Academy, almost as much as I love you. I wanna say something about this relationship. I've known you over the years. You've... you've dated a lot of women. - Right. - And I see you with her "This time, I think it's gonna last". Love is the great reducer of ego, Jimmy. I love you. Oh! I love you. I love her. Oh! - Oh! Sorry! - Auch! See? We do our own stunts. She's my best friend. Now, tell me. You are heading down to Mexico now to wrap up the trilogy. Is that bittersweet for you? Yes, it is. We actually have two more scenes we're filming here in LA. Unlike these other busy gigs... Another one. Mr. Clark, set's ready for you! Mr. Clark! - He came out? - No. - I keep knocking but... - We have to practice our catch. He's probably doing his sangha meditation. Cute! Hey! Um... I'm in character so... This doesn't count, right? I found Adam. Soph... Sophie... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm great! So, Soph, like... How does she look? I mean, how is she doing? Aesthetically, flawless. Mentally, deranged. I have to figure out how to tell the studio about this mess. It's done! She's gonna do the movie, we're not gonna discuss the breakup until after the movie is wrapped. I've done this a million times. It's the perfect formula. Works every single time. I know there's a lot going on here, but I need to figure out what I'm gonna tell the studio. Really, now? Read the room. - I have three buts. - You have three buts. That's a lot of buts to have. That's a lot of pressure. Oh, no, no, no. I need help. Hurry. No! Get the phone! The phone! Jesus Christ! Thank you. Okay, I got it. Don't try to touch my boob. Hi! I feel like an idiot. Of course I did this to myself, but now my career is gonna be over. I'll be on "The Masked Singer" dressed like up like an octopus. I mean, cheating? It's actually very hip. It's very French, you know? Why do you think we all go to the Cannes every year? For the movies? Yeah, okay, okay. The best thing you can do for her is forgive yourself and make sure that this does not get out before the Oscars. Oh, my god! The Oscars! Lie down. - Okay. - I threw up. Okay. We saw that. You did such a good job getting it out. We're finishing the movie because it's everything we've ever worked for. But I don't understand keeping up appearances with this hen... Whether you like or not, they are more famous together than they are apart. I mean, they're a pair! We'll circle back to that, okay? I have to deal with whatever is happening here. I'm free! Good morning. Good morning. Coffee? Yes, please. Thank you, that's very kind. You're welcome. What are you cooking over there? The only clinically proven cure for hangover. Chilaquiles. Oh! You're appealing to my wholesome side. - For my food blog. - I'm honored. - I didn't know you had one. - You didn't know I have one because we don't really know anything about each other. - We don't, do we? - Actually, I take that back. I know you went to Cornell. I know you can cook. And that you have no idea what my name is. All very useful observations. Very. Do you know mine? No. Well... This international love affair is skipping romantic. Not us. So, um. I have to go to work. I manage a hotel a couple of miles away. Do you want me to order you an Uber or... I already got one. Thank you for breakfast. By the way... I like that we don't know each other's names. Bye. You. - Really? Again? - What? Dude, I don't get you. The girl stays over, you make her breakfast. And at the end you just say, "Goodbye forever"? She only stayed for the weekend. I was making sure her stay in Playa Mujeres was really pleasurable. It's always the tourists. It's easier that way. What about a partner? Someone who improves you as a person. That lasts more than hours. When did you last have a real relationship? I've created the perfect relationship. Mutually beneficial, no expectations, symbiotic. Tourists come and go. There's a shared understanding that things can't go further. It's beautiful! And with no distractions. He's such a dick! Look at that asshole sleeping. That's why I don't date actors. They're unstable narcissists with no perception of reality. Not you, of course. Chris, why are we sharing the car with all this? You'd have to ask my now former assistant, Larissa. She assured me of it on the phone. Never trust an adult with braces. I've had this recurring nightmare, all in black and white where I'm standing in animal print pajamas, holding a knife and about to stab him. But the guilt stops me. I turn around suddenly, he gets up, takes the knife, stabs me in the back. I bleed out. And my blood is red. It's the only part of the dream that is in color. We get it. You've seen "Schindler's List". - We need a drink. - Yes, please. - What are we celebrating? - The last of the trilogy. - I'm gonna get bangs! - No! - No! - No bangs. Remember what happened to Meredith Cooper? - Who's Meredith Cooper? - My point exactly. It's due to bangs. Boss, the suites are ready, the menus are set. - The staff is all prepared. - Come. I need you to tell me the status of the artists. - I'll check. - Have they arrived? Antonio, do you copy? Don't bother, I fired him. Why? Rule number one, don't sleep with guests. Poor guy. No, he had a great time. Too bad it cost him his job. I need you to handle the artists while I get a replacement. As if. Do I sound like I'm joking? No way, Aurelia. I already went through that. What do you mean by that? You're asking me to take a big step back. What part of your job don't you get? We handle everything in this hotel. It doesn't matter how big or small it is. Or hospitality is something they didn't teach in your fancy school? Do you want me to promote you to manager of the New York branch? I've worked so hard for that. That damn meritocracy has damaged you. No, my love. You need my recommendation. And start getting used to it because in this industry, you're gonna deal with Hollywood artists for the rest of your life. So you want me to play nanny for these crazy artists? Yes. It's just six weeks. Well done, Alejandro! From employee of the month to babysitter of the year. Good! Oh, Julia! The towels! - Okay, first thing I'm doing. - Yes? - Phoebe Ranger's up. - Okay. You are the best. - I'm taking a shower. - You have twenty, twenty-five. You'd better move on. Okay! - Oh, wow! - Hot! This is heaven. I've died and gone to it. My beautiful girlina. Devil incarnate. Oh, my goodness, Alejandro! Hi, Miss Almas. You wouldn't mind if I grab some of these towels, would you? No, not at all. Oh. By the way, thank you so much for sending me the champagne, the chocolates and the oysters. They saved my marriage! You're very welcome. Have a great rest of your stay. Thanks. Yes! Thank you for always being there for me. Duh! - Take a pic. - Thanks. I wanna look kind of shy like... Oh, turn. Oh, yeah. But with good tits. Sorry I cut you off. These are so cute! Oh! That is the vibe here! Tit out, palm up, mango energy. - I'm sad. - I know but I heard an audio book that said you have to lean into that, like let yourself be sad. You know, just feel the sadness. Speaking of... drinks. We need drinks. I'm getting us drinks. - No. - Alcohol fixes everything. You'll never feel pain again. I'll be back. I love you! I love you. Sophie, it's me, Firephina. You're hot shit! Adam Clark... He's a bad actor. But you... You're amazing. And worthy of love. I mean that. Oh! I ran here! Just give me a minute. It's good to see you again. Yes, copy, copy. - My god! - Shit! Who are you?! - I'm so sorry! - Are you trying to take pictures of my feet saying I'm good enough for money? What? No! I'm Alejandro, the junior manager of the hotel. You're who? I was just making sure everything was okay with your room, Miss Wilder, and I saw there were no towels. There was no one in here so I... Oh, my god! You're a terrible manager! Actually, I'm not. Like I said, I didn't realize you'd be here. Excuse me? Okay, this is intruding. How did you not hear the shower running? Miss Wilder, I'm... very sorry. My deepest apologies. It was my mistake. Do you... - Do you have the...? - Yes. - I'm leaving now! - Good. I'm not in my walkie, Mom. Sorry. I'm just gonna... grab my walkie. I'm really sorry about the towels. Honey, I'm home! Oh! - Hi. - I'm Rachel, I'm a Virgo. And I'm 5'7", which is kind of tall for a girl. Margarita time! Well, if you need anything from, you know, you can just call the front desk and we'll assist you right away. I'm sure you would be. Thank you so much. Have a great stay. Gay? Thanks, Alejandro. I forgot the towels. It's okay. Don't worry. I must confess I was head over heels. Adam Clark, my God! That man is...! He looks better in person. And he's so tall! On the internet it says he's 5'97" tall, but I think he's like 6'06". I don't know if you noticed, Tachi, but Adam Clark touched my hand. He loves me! - I saw it. - Right? He loves me. Okay, come on. He was just tipping you. - Good gossip. - It was just a tip. - You'll love this story. - Spill it. I was doing my job, making sure their rooms were perfect. Then, I saw her... and I repeat, I was doing my job. And she entered... naked. You saw Sophie Wilder, Firephina, naked? She went crazy! She's a goddamn crazy actress! Nuts. A prima donna. Was I rude earlier? To the guy? No! Oh, my god. He walked on you completely naked. If anything, you are alarmingly civil. Well, you didn't hear me. She has a little bit of a crush, doesn't she? I love single you! Oh my god! This is perfect. A fun little fling. The first. You know, I see this with so much love in my heart but I've been waiting for this moment for years. It is time. You're free. And if you're not gonna do it, I'm gonna draft it. I'm gonna draft the notes of the breakup post. Okay, but this is my life, not an attempt to go viral. Sophie! I have incredible news! He cheated on you. Please, the world needs to know. This guy's a monster. He once told me he didn't think girls should go to school. You wanna tell everybody he cheated on me? No! Absolutely not. Hey, you. I got this. I got this one. Okay. What would Meryl do? Meryl would put a pin in all of this and she would raise a glass of Moet et Chandon. - Don't mind if I do. - Am I right? And she would celebrate the script that I just got for you. What is it? I got you "New York or Nowhere". Shut up! She got the offer? Well, we got an offer for a meeting and a tape. Which is similar. - Sophie Wilder does not tape. - I can tape. Sophie Wilder is fine with the tape, so is "Emily from Paris" and Sarah Sherona and... You do the accent when you say her name. And she's Irish. They're all submitting a tape. I don't book tapes that I don't do with Adam. Oh, the way this man has brainwashed you, babe! - What year is this? - You haven't stopped talking about him for a single second, please! It was a five-year relationship! Oh! No, no, no! Margo Cohen, I cannot take it. If I wanna be topped, I'm doing Grindr, thank you. It's all you. Okay, wow. Thanks. - Go, girl! - She's not that scary. Girl-boss! - It's my girl-boss. - Hi! - Hi, Margo! - Too nice. She sounds like a little baby when she answers the phone. I need a diaper. I'm a little school girl. I order the same way in a restaurant. Could I have a souffl? How did you...? The best thing you can do for you right now is to say absolutely nothing about the break up are in the can. Okay, uh... Does that really align with our values as women in this industry? I mean... I feel trapped. You feel trapped. Okay, well... You know? This industry just... quick reminder, was built on the back of a five year-old child named Shirley Temple, who they made wear miniskirts and dance on a grown man's lap. Not a mother in sight, so... you are the one to get the short end of the stick. It's you. I'm not talking about his stick. I don't know if it's short or not. I didn't look at the nudes. I just made them go away. Well, we can change the narrative. Brad and Jen, but Ben and Jen... Aniston, not Lopez. Just another Jen? I don't. You have a business brain. Don't worry, I brushed my teeth after lunch. I didn't. Okay. Okay, rolling. Silence! Action! Okay, let's cut! Come with me! Right! Cut! Soph, dear, I think your kiss ain't working for me. - Yeah. - You know what I think? I think you wake up first, you realize where you are. First punch, then kiss. Set. Full, full. There's a bottle of water there. Okay, let's go folks! Action! That's for almost dying. And that's for saving the world. Now, where the hell are we? And cut! That was beautiful! Thank you, Soph. The studio says hers is too freezy. No, she's perfect. All right, I think we have it. Hey, Margo, I wanted to close the... Excuse me! No, thank you! Anyway, circling back, no, no circle in black. Margo, I just bought some SPF 50 which made me think of you, uh... No. Hey! Margo, they are all checked in separate rooms on opposite ends of the hotel. They' re now on the same set. Say a prayer. - Hey! - Hi. There's some lavender in there, you know, for the stress. How could you tell I was stressed? Is it because I yelled at the child? You know, you're on vacation! You should relax a little. I am here doing damage control and then I have to head back to LA in six hours to meet with Avril Lavigne's team about the skater board bio pic. I love her. I do too. She's actually a client of mine. Is she nice? Uh? Kind of complicated, isn't it? So you're Taki. Um... Tachi. Tachi. The pleasure is mine, Tachi. I love your cock... tails. Oh, thank you. Every time I feel like they might know me it's either: Oh my god! It's Firephina! Or worst, it's Adam Clark's girlfriend! Oh, right the strike of midnight, Pancho. Yes, otherwise I will be turning into a pumpkin. Here's the derby food and that's the bar. Good night, guys. I'll... see you tomorrow. Miss Wilder, late night? Double of the time, but we got the shots we needed. Didn't know you played basketball. I don't. Oh, I see the confusion. Is there a late night menu? Yeah, I'll go grab one. Hey, Soph, um... I thought you did wonderfully today, but never feel like you have to rush through your text. I mean, we're the stars. We run the set. Right? Okay, if you're talking about scene 36, I thought we got it and I was giving the director the time she needed for the stunts. We'll see. Tape never lies. Oh, my God! Captain Thunder?! You're the actress! Fire... Uh... Fire... I can't handle fans at this hour. Good night. I can't. I love all the sequels to "Secret Society". - Guys, could we...? - "Super Society". No, please, I'm so sorry. I'm so tired. Excuse me, bitch? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Sir, you can't do that. I'm a guest! No, you're drunk and you're getting back to your room. - Martin, take him to his room. - Let's go. She's famous, you know? I'm telling drunken gringos to get back to their room. Curse of the job. Here, Miss Wilder. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, is this all you have? Uh, our kitchens are closed. So sorry. How disappointing! I guess I'll just starve 'till the sun rises. Good evening, Miss Wilder. What a night! Miss Wilder? What are doing? Oh! Thank God! I hate cooking. Can you help a gal in need? That looks like trouble. It's a sandwich. So, you and Mr. Clarke are shooting a movie. Yeah, the third of the "Super Society" trilogy. You've never seen "Super Society", have you? Sorry. Don't be. They're silly. And according to Scorsese, not cinema. Well, what does he know? Happy? Thank you. You're welcome. But... You're very hospitable. Thank you. Ever since my dad left, I felt responsible for taking care of my mom and sister, so hospitality was a natural fit. I once invited my Postmates driver in for Thanksgiving dinner that he had just delivered. Wow! So you do really hate cooking. Yeah. How it takes longer than it does to eat it. Did you, um... did you always work here? Yeah, I was actually born and raised in this hotel. Like Eloise. I work here now and I'm headed to New York. I'm part of the rotation program for the hotel where, hopefully, I'll be able to manage there. He says with disdain. Because I wanna open my own place, but a boutique hotel. A place that's cozier and smaller where people from all over the world can come and feel at home. Please, tell me more. How do I put it? Like... When you're making coffee and you choose your favorite mug, right? But you leave it out, forget about it. It's cold, it's very sad. In my hotel, we'd make sure that coffee mug is always warm. - You've thought about that a lot. - Yes, I have. And in the meantime, I get to take care of wonderful hotel guests like yourself, Miss Wilder. Call me, Sophie. You have seen me naked. I wasn't looking. Well now I'm offended. - Uf! - Oh, no! No! No! No! No! I... I shouldn't even had that. You're not missing out on my grandmother's secret recipe. It's not happening. Spoon me. - I know. - It's so unfair! If I ever meet your grandmother, I'm giving her a huge hug. Do you know how to get back to your room from here, Miss Wilder? No. Good night. Hi, mom! I miss you too. But I'll see you at Dani's birthday next week. Yes, mom. Love you. Kisses. Let's check this out. What is it, boss? What are you doing here? I was passing by. And I remembered our conversation yesterday. - So I came to help. - Good timing. Miss Sophie has just called asking for you. Since when are you so excited by your guest relations role? Not at all. What did she want? Hello! Hi, uh... I was told Miss Wilder needs some towels. Towels, that's hilarious. You know, you can just ask for her number. I' m joking. Come down, come inside. Let's go. Sophie! Soph! Who is it? - Oh God. - Is that Adam? No. It's the cute guy who saw you naked. By the... I did not see her naked. Yeah, now I've heard everything. I thought it was your day off. Uh, yeah, it was. I was called in for a last minute meeting for a committee that I oversee and, uh, I'm an overachiever. Well it's good to see you. It's good to see you. Too. Hey! Huh! Doctor Thunder? I mean, Mister Clark. My God! It looks like we got a fan here! You want a selfie? I'll give you one in a minute, okay? Wow! Look at me! Who's this handsome devil? Check me out. Good evening, Miss Wilder. Are you in need of more of these? Because this morning I did your room and I thought I had changed them all, but... If I made a mistake, I apologize. I'm sorry. No. No, you didn't. You didn't make a mistake. I ordered a lot of towels. You've inspired me. From one apology to another. I'm so sorry. Yesterday on the set, I was transfixed by the words and I failed to be your equal scene partner. I really miss you. Are you listening? Banquets, do you copy? Are the centerpieces and tablecloths ready for the event? Great. I'm on my way, thank you. Hi! Hi, Miss Wilder! It's so beautiful here. I was wondering, can I take a tour? Yeah, of course. I'd be happy to assist you with that. - It would have to be private. - Of course. Where would you like to go? You can go scuba diving or go visit cenotes, which are actually my favorite. They're amazing. - Or Mayan ruins perhaps? - Actually I'd like to go dancing. Dancing? - Good afternoon. - Hi, how are you? When would you like to go? Tomorrow? Okay, is there a particular style you and Mr. Clark would like? Oh, it's just me. And... Tango. What time? At midnight. Hey! Hey! How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. Well, welcome to Isla Mujeres. Is this where you want to open up your hotel? No. Uh, I mean, it's beautiful here but... I was looking at places in San Miguel de Allende. Oh! That's... That's where my grandmother was born. - No way! - Yeah. Yeah. I heard it's beautiful. - You've never been? - No. Two Pacificos, please! Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Shall we dance? I should warn you. I'm a fantastic dancer. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Okay. Oh. I thought you'd be a little better at dancing. - That was all you. - Oh, really? Thank you. I haven't had that much fun in a while. I mean, that was... Hot? Aren't you and Adam... I mean I'm... Good night, Alejandro. Good night. I kissed Sophie Wilder. Technically, I made the first move. No! You're going to break the sweet little boy's heart. That's big news! What's he gonna do? What about the Adam deal? I asked if they were together. What did she say? - Well, I kissed him. - You can do whatever you want! If Aurelia finds out, she'll kill me. I can't risk my job. Relax. You're nervous. She won't find out. If Adam finds out, he is going to lose it. - I don't care. - Don't care? Be honest. Did you feel butterflies in your stomach? Come on, you did! You did! Cheers! I still feel them. I can feel them. Hey, Sophie! Adam. Look, um, I know we never discussed it, but I feel like it'd be best if we were together. And I know I need to apologize to us. I've been going through an identify defusion. I'm sorry, a what? No, I... I know. The language... it seems broad. Um... I just want to discuss our romantic terms. And... the idea of us getting back together, after such a traumatic experience. It's got legs. Doesn't it? Wow! I, um... I just need some space. Sure. Yeah. Well, it was good to... - Right, space. - Space. Sorry. All right. You want space? How's this for space?! Rest well, Santi. - See you tomorrow, Marquitos. - See you later, sir. Hey! Hello, you. Sounds fine. By that I'm mean that I'll be there soon. Miss Wilder! Good evening. So sorry, I was just walking. It's okay! Have a good night. Good night, Miss Wilder. How are you, Chuy? Can you sign this, boss? Let's see. As legend has it, the only way to get my power back is with a sacrifice. Thousands of years ago... Ready? And action! Miss Calloway, I'm your lawyer! The jury is gonna lock you away for a crime you didn't commit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, no. - You're making it. - No, stop. Stop. Okay. Mr. Baxter, you're a good lawyer. The best those big Fifth Avenue bucks can buy. But what does the law say about falling in love?! What's so funny? What? - You're taking it very seriously. - I'm in character! I know, it's great! You're, wow! Coffee talk. Hot dogs. Brooklyn. Let's go! Come on! I'm not gonna book "New York or Nowhere" anyway. It's gonna go to a Lily. For some reason it always goes to a Lily. Yeah. It's okay because I said I wouldn't do a remake anyway. - This is... - I love this film. I know. This is literally the best acting I've ever seen in my life. No, really. You are crushing it! - Yeah. - You are killing it! You haven't seen enough acting. Thank you. Thank you. You're a much better scene partner than Adam. He... I... Sorry. Never mind. What are we doing? Guest relations? Are you dating Adam? It's all over the internet. It's all everyone talks about. Did you order something? No, I have no idea. Um... Uh... I'll go through the door on the back. - I'm gonna go on the back. - Okay. Hi! Good night, Mrs. Wilder - Come on in. - This was sent for you. Did you have seen the view to Isla Mujeres? Yeah, yeah. It's beautiful. And the room it's... so great. Did you have the opportunity to watch it? - To Isla? - Yeah! We can arrange a special tour for you and mister Clark. That would... be great. So charming. So, this is really incredible. Uh... I didn't realize how great it was. So I think I'm gonna go to sleep soon. Yes. Yes. Yes. We are leaving. So sorry. - It's a pleasure. - Good night. Man! That was close! Damn! TO DR. THUNDER AND FIREPHINA, THE MOST POWERFUL COUPLE IN THE WORLD. HAVE A GREAT SHOOT. You wanted to know about Adam and me. He cheated on me. So much like the characters in the films that we're starring. It's all pretend. So you fake being in love? Why? I don't wanna be treated like another Jen. I have no idea what that means. It's embarrassing. Can we not talk about it? I have a surprise for you. Some place we won't be interrupted. And... Midnight with you is my favorite hour. Midnight isn't a time. It's a place for us to be together. Copy, I'm on my way. I gotta go. I wish we could go somewhere we didn't have to hide. I know. Hello. - You sure about this? - Yes! We both have the day off and nobody will be looking for you until tomorrow. All right. Where are you taking me? Oh, it's a surprise. I can't tell you. This is so fun! Wow! Oh, there's no... there's no reception. It's part of the magic here. No cell service. I cannot remember the last time I could ignore my phone. She said with envy. - Just here? - Yeah, it's perfect. Okay. You just have to curate the vibe. Okay, so it is guest relations. Of course! Yes? Amazing! Yes, I love that. That's perfect. Um... Let me just check, double check with her schedule and I will get back to you. You are hilarious. I'm laughing. Okay. Thank you, pleasure's mine. Bye bye. Are you ready to experience the magic of a national gastronomical treasure? Chips and sauce? How dare you? No! - Prepared chips. - "Prepared chips". Good. Can you hand me a Pacifico, please? Yes. Of course. Thank you. - With our eyes. - With our eyes. If not it's very bad luck. So, first, a little bit of Maggi. A little love in there, pum, pum. Then, English sauce. No one leaves voice mails but I'm leaving this voice mail so you know I tried to connect. Okay. Lime. Here in Mexico we put lime on everything. Okay. It's a lot of lime. Oh yeah. Ready? So when are you opening up your hotel? I don't know. I keep telling myself 'next year', the year after that, but then I have to go to New York in a couple of months and... I love New York. It's crowded and dirty and full of trash and rats, but it's so magical. So what's stopping you from opening up your place? Honestly? It scares the shit out of me. Why? What if I fail? What if I open it and no one shows up? Or even worse, what if I open it and no one likes it? Have you ever read some of the comments on Trip Advisor? They're ruthless! Alejandro, what if you never try? "Puta madre"! What does that mean? "Puta madre"? It means... Motherfucker! Hi, don't be mad. She's in the hotel. - It's just a very big hotel. - Rachel, listen to me. - Rachel, listen to me. - She hadn't mentioned going to... Rachel, please listen to me! Listen to me what I'm asking you! No, Rachel, seriously, stop talking. Where is she? Okay? What the hell is going on? - She's definitely in the hotel. - Is she? - Are we sure? - I wouldn't lie. Any ideas as to where in the hotel she may be? She had wanted to do this acroyoga class. For 10 hours? And she needed lift face resveratrol. Okay. She's getting a zombie facial for 10 hours? Yes, and she's doing... She's fine. We have to talk to a professional. Excuse me. Did anyone say anything at any point about her going anywhere - with anyone? - No, I'm sorry. - Thank you, Aurelia. - Yes. I guess we're gonna have full dateline and call the police. - No! - No, no, no! Look who's here! I didn't know you were coming. - Sophie's gone missing... - Relax. - What? - And we don't know where she is. Missing is a very extreme word. Hey! Quiet! Quiet everybody! I got this. We need the schematics of the building. I need to get in your main frame. You understand me? Comprende? Also, we need a couple of blood hounds. Whatever kind of dogs you can get. An article of her clothing, preferably underwear. The dogs love it, okay? Oh, my god! Why would I ask an actor to do anything? So, how's Sophie Wilder doing? Miserable at best. No, seriously. I mean, you have a lot of stuff going on. Uh... Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty caught up in work. Firephina above all. She's great. Who wouldn't want to be a superhero? But sometimes there is a lot of pressure because people love her so much. The costume, you know, and the catchphrases and the intensity. People get really into it. And so do I. It's a huge part of my life. But sometimes I wonder... who am I? Well I'm a fan. Oh, no, you watched. Not of Firephina. Of you, Sophie. Good morning. Want some coffee? I fell sleep. Oh my god! I wasn't supposed to stay overnight. Everybody's probably looking for me. What time is it? Shit! We need to go. We... We need to go. - You okay? - No, we have to go! Like... like right now. - We have to go! - Man! Okay! Don't worry, we're almost there. I'm sure you'll be fine. No. This is not fine. Calm down, Sophie. I shouldn't even be here! We shouldn't have done this! I'm not on vacation! I'm here for work! This was a huge mistake! My job is at stake too, you know? It's a little different, Alejandro. What the hell were you thinking going off God knows where? Do you know how worried we were for you? Not to mention I had to leave LA in the middle of a very exclusive healing circle with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis as shamans so that I could come looking for you! Okay? Do I look like a babysitter to you? Huh? Do you see me with a little Baby Bjorn and some mushed carrots ready to attend your every need? I have other clients, Soph. Okay? I was supposed to be at Florence Pugh's cookbook release party at the Barnes & Noble at The Grove, eating her signature one pan chicken cacciatore but, uh uh. I'm out here playing grab ass looking for you! I said I was sorry. I needed to get out of here. My phone died. - I stayed at a hotel nearby. - We had to call the police, Sophie! The freaking "polic a"! Okay? And I had to do some very bad things with a low level intern at TMZ so that this didn't become a freaking international media frenzy! Okay, I think she gets it. Deborah Jackson Katz from the studio was here to talk to you about your standalone feature and guess who wasn't here? Any guesses? The answer is you. You weren't here. In the hotel by the sea. And that's a big problem, sister friend. Now, not even... as one of the Hollywood reporters 35 under 35 entertainment professionals, but as your friend, you could've called or texted so I knew you were okay. Okay? Now, you have two weeks left on this film. I want you... to get Demi Moore's reiki specialist on Zoom if that's what it takes for you to pull yourself together to finish this fantastic movie. "Capisce"? I've had enough. I'm gonna go eat a taquito and think about this and I want you to repent. Thank you so much for not saying anything. Duh! Oh my god! Alejandro would be in more trouble than me. Please, I care about you and your heart way more than this Hollywood stuff. Plus, you looked happy as shit. Everyone was looking for her like idiots for her to say her phone died and that she couldn't let anyone know. Can you believe it? She's so selfish! That's crazy. You scared us. I... I made a mistake. I'm sorry. To err is human. To forgive is divine. I wanna get back together, Sophie. I really do. Cheating is romantic, if you think about it. Look, I know I made a huge mistake. Do you really want to be treated like just another Jen? Sophie Wilder and Firephina. How much do you two have in common? Are you the same person at this point? Well, I booked the part when I was in my early twenties, so, you know, when you play a character for that long, they inevitably become a part of who you are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um... Going in depth. Sorry, to you or the camera? To him. - -To, uh, to... - I'm asking him. - To me please. - Okay. The love story between us is about the unforeseen. And Doctor Thunder has been alive for centuries. Meanwhile, Firephina is the newer young soul that's fiery. Right. It's quite unexpected that he would have her as a wingman. - Why is that? - But... Because, uh, Doctor Thunder is this bitter intellectual god type and she's, she's just corky. - Corky? - Yeah. She's the keeper of the sacred flame of Kukulcan. - -Okay... - Well... As part of the vibe I never caught, I think we're getting to oily territory which I think we wanna try to avoid. But that's what I love about Sophie Wilder. Her enthusiasm for learning and growing it. I think she's coming along fine. You know what my favorite thing about Adam Clark is? What's that? He is such a skilled snake charmer. All right, I think we've had enough. - Thanks. - Great! Very unprofessional. Hey! Is this about that lobby boy, right? Look, if you wanna get back at me or teach me some sort of lesson, I get it. But... - him? Really? - Wow! Okay... Whatever is going on between me and Alejandro, who is incredible, by the way, has nothing to do with you. Oh, yeah? Is that right? You know what? I'm not your pet project. You're not better than me! Okay? And I don't need you, to be me. - And you're a terrible poet! - Wow! Except for that Pablo Neruda you played. - I did not... - This feels incredible! He paid people in college to write his papers for him! - She's making it up! - We are firing Margo Cohen. "Hey it's Sophie. We need to talk. Can you meet on the beach?" - Dude, that's awesome! - Of course not! "We need to talk"? It's terrible news. That's a bad text. It can't be. Look at that. - It has no punctuation. Nothing. - That's actually good. That means it's open to interpretation. - It means she was mad! - It's okay! Listen. I think she wants to see you, apologize and tell you she loves you. - Really? - Sure! Why would she text you? What film do you live in? Of course not! - No, no, no. - I know life is not a movie. Ok, maybe this is good news. You know? We almost got caught. It's complicated. I need to end this now! Listen. Love is complicated. Do you love her? Go get her. I was just so overwhelmed and I treated you unfairly. I... There's no need to apologize. But I like who I am when I'm with you. And I like who I am when I'm with you but... Wait, wait. I'm not finished. I pretended to be with Adam. You know what? It doesn't... It doesn't even matter. It's over. I ended that. And now you and I don't have to pretend, to hide anymore. Okay, but... My future is still on the line. You know? And... Yeah, you're right. That's a fantastic point. Didn't you say you want to open up a place? Yeah, but that's... that's later. Later? I have the weekend off. You wanna run away? I would love to, really. But I have to go to Mexico City. It's my sister's birthday and I told my family I'd be there. Normally I'd be excited, but my dad is gonna be there with his new lover. Dad and his new lover. Ugh, yeah. I'll go with you. - To Mexico City? - Yeah. Oh, come on! I've never been! And this really great guy told me It is impossible to say no to you. And you know that. What? I'm sorry! Who is he, Sophie? Is he your new beau? - Are you ready? - This is it? Wait until you see the inside. Don't be nervous. They'll love you. I'm not nervous. I get along very well with parents. Barbara and I are still very close. Who's Barbara? Don't worry about it. Oh, shit. I forgot something in the car. I'll be right back. - You... but... - The bottle. I'll be right back. Should I...? No. I didn't ring the doorbell. Hi there! - Hi. - I'm sorry. I'm here with Alejandro. - Hi. - Hi! Happy birthday. - Thank you! - What's wrong, Sebas? Sophie, this is my sister Daniela. - Hi. - What's up, Akilita? Nice to meet you. Happy birthday!

This looks incredible. Sopes. Guacamole. Cheese. Thank you. Thank you, Sebas. Nopales. Those are very spicy. He made me "prepared chips" the other day. He made you? And a cake. He cooked for you? Yeah! You don't even make popcorn for my birthday. Of course I do. Of course I do. Alejandro, come help me in the kitchen. Now? I'll help you too, mom. Stay with grandma, hon. Grandma, keep an eye on her! We'll be fine. We'll use signs. - Right, sweetie? Sit here. - Yes. I want to know everything! You didn't tell me you'd bring someone! - Is she your girlfriend? - It was last minute. - Do you want a beer? - I want to know who she is. Son! She's a friend. I met her at the hotel. - From LA? - No one believes you. Come on. Listen. We met at the hotel. She is working. We met, we became friends, that's all! What work? "We are getting to know each other." How are you "getting to know" each other? - Tell me! - Have you slept together? - Come on! - They did! They love gossip. But you don't have to keep me company. Join them in the kitchen! To the kitchen? No, no, no. I don't cook. I can't make a cake from a box. Cake! Grandma! Alejandro gave me some of your famous recipe, your chocolate cake! Ah, yeah! I owe you a hug! Thank you very much! Let's toast for the pleasure of being together! - Cheers! - Cheers! Happy birthday! Sh! It's Akilita. What's up, Akilita? You scared me. What is it? Come here! Akila! That's a very special pink. It's called Mexican pink. - It's the same as on the taxis. - Yeah. Then the jacaranda tree, so everything was built... Oh, I gave your grandma a hug for the chocolate cake recipe. No! Yeah. I said I would. What? Why are you laughing? She hates chocolate cake. Hates it! I just didn't want the night to end. You lied to me? You're a jester. This is Veronica, my fianc e. Happy birthday! Welcome! She's... she's young. Yeah. - Hi! Happy birthday! - Alejandrito! Hi. - How are you? - Fine. - This is Sophie, this is my... - Alejandro, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. She's my fianc, Veronica. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hi! Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot about you from your dad. Same here. I think I saw you in one of those TV shows? You're an actress. - Yeah, yeah, I am. - Great! I imagine you stay quite busy. What's your next project? Um... I'm not actually sure. I'm just circling some things right now. Oh, great for you! You can have Alejandro picking up all those red M&Ms and carrying luggage, no? I'm going to the bathroom. Okay. She's so lovely. Lovely. And how long are you staying here? Just tonight. Came here for the birthday. Great, it means a lot to your sister. Yeah, I know. How's your lobby life? I'm the junior manager now. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - A promotion? - A while ago. Great. Let me help you. I can invest in your business. I don't need you to. - Are you sure? - Sure. Thanks. Okay. Do me a favor? Be nice to my fianc e. Can you speak English? She doesn't speak Spanish. - Okay. - It's fine. She's so cute! You survived! Yeah, thanks to you. - He's intense. - He's an asshole. This house! This house, you were saying, it's... it's this architect. Luis Barrag n. It was gonna be built a bit differently and she doesn't like me to say it, but she had like a flirtatious relationship with him. - Oh! - And one of the rooms... - The thing you told us. - Shut up! That's a secret. Having fun? Our little wonderful dysfunctional family. So much fun. It's amazing you guys managed to stay friends. We're friends because we were never in love, but we love our kids. She doesn't need to hear the whole family story, that's... I would love to hear the whole family story. - Where is the bathroom? - Spanish? - Down the hall, to the right. - Thank you. She's beautiful. I'm in love with this man. Alejandro, not the dad. Wait, I'm sorry, what? How long will the romance with the star last? Alejandro, be optimistic. Please. They're young. She is a famous star. A millionaire. How much do you make a month at your job? - Don't listen to him. - Here we go. No, come on. He is... They gave it to someone else. Okay. - How much do you earn? - Son. Do you know what will happen to her in her next job when she falls in love with the protagonist or the antagonist? That's how they are. You have to focus on what you must do. I love you. Just because you do that, doesn't mean she will. - I do that? - What's the number - of this marriage? - Honey. - Four right? - Do you love her? We're talking about you. It's always about you. - What do you expect from her? - She is just a tourist. - Hey. - Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. Oh, no, I just found out I didn't book "New York or Nowhere". I'm sorry to hear that. You know what? It wasn't meant to be. No, it's okay, it's the sudden strike, it's a heartbreak. Perks of the job. Yeah. So, what are you gonna do next after all this? After all this? Yeah, like, when you're done with the movie. Uh... Uh, I don't know. I don't know. Go on a trip. Or something. I guess. Sorry, I think I missed something. Did you just tell your dad that I'm just a tourist? I was joking. Okay, well, let me know how much I owe you for the services. - What's that supposed to mean? - It's a joke. Anything else you wanna say? No. I feel like such an idiot. Why am I here? You could've told me if you didn't want me to come. You invited yourself. Okay, so, I'm sorry, I just... This is just a thing you do, you take girls out and you show them how to squeeze lime on everything - and then you sleep with them? - Sophie, calm down. - Calm down? - Yeah. You're acting a bit... Crazy? Sorry, I just think I'm realizing that you might be full of shit. The photo. Photo. The photo! Photo, come on! Photo! I'm full of shit? You're in a fake relationship with someone, Sophie. Now is just your little fantasy. - My little fantasy? - Yeah, but that's what you do because actors play pretend. And that's okay. I was very, very clear from the very beginning. I was focused on my career and I thought you were too. You never go after what you want! And you have no idea what you deserve. And you do? I thought I did. Alejandro, come! We're ready for the photo. A photo, yeah! - Come! - Come now! Come! Come now! Here. One, two, three! SOPHIE WILDER CHEATS ON ADAM CLARK WITH HOTEL EMPLOYEE! - What will I do without you? - Aurelia, it was a mistake! I'm sorry. - I don't want to lose you. - Then don't! You should have thought of that before going off and being all horny. What about New York? That was the plan. - You can't do this to me. - Ah, plans... Your plans. Well, now your plan can be to go run away with your artist. - No, that's done now. - What do you mean "it's done"? It's over. I can't believe you're such a coward! My powers are gone but it's me. Shake the puppet more. More. Shake the puppet. I missed you! Shit! I'm in love. - What will you do about it? - What do you mean? She hates me! Alejandro, for the first time, don't let fear stop you. Come on! Just text her and apologize. That's it. A text message? Are you insane? Write her a letter. Then you burn it and blow it in the wind. She'll find it. This is for you. Glue? Mmh. It's for your heart. Glue it. Panchito. Yes, I need your help. Go, go, go. I'll take care of the plate. - Thank you. - Good luck! Where are they? On the set? Okay. ANTIQUES AND D COR Thank you! Rachel! Hey, Rachel. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? Are you doing the scene girls want guys to do? I'm trying to, but I need your help. - I can't help you. - Please. No, no, no, I can't help you. I'm mad at you. - I know. - Legally, I'm mad at you. - For the feminism. - I know, I know, please. - No. - Please. No, I can't. - I'm stupid! - No, no, you're not stupid. You made my friend happier than anyone has made her ever, - but, do you love her? - Yes! Do you love her 'cuz she's rich? - 'Cuz she's famous? - No! Do you love her 'cuz she's good in bed? - Yes! No! Why do you know that? - A woman knows. Why do you love her? I love her 'cuz she's the best thing that I never planned for and because she makes me want to be a better man. That was really good. Okay, if I was looking for her I'd think she was about to do the scene where she does the do do and the da da and everyone goes bah! I don't know. I never read the scripts. I only sign them. I'm like a walking lawsuit. She's probably gonna be in hair and makeup right there. Thank you. Thank you. You're the best. Thank you! I know. I'm the best. I'm the best. Virtuous souls will always pass. Empty your hand and get what you ask. But be warned. If you are damned, the map of Kukulkan will burn you to sand. A bit harsh. Sorry, bud. - -It's you! - Shit, I'm sorry. No. Wait! You're looking for Sophie, aren't you? Yes, I am. Do you believe yourself worthy of her love? I would hope so. And she of yours? Beyond. Cut! Can someone please get Adam? We're waiting for Adam! Where's Adam? We're losing light. We need the actor. Can someone please get Adam? Love... is the great reducer of ego. Look man, I'm just trying to find her and... The great reducer... of ego. I'm coming! Okay, let's do this, guys. From the top. Lights. Quickly. Running! Take one. This is it! Action! Sophie, I just want to apologize. You've gotta be kidding me? Look, I'm sorry! - What are you doing? - Hi, by the way. I was so selfish in Mexico City and... I handled things terribly. And you're right. I'm scared of love. Alejandro, I don't fit into your plan. My plan means nothing without you, Sophie. I love you. No. I'm leaving soon and then I'm leaving again, and again. You were right. - I'm just a tourist. - No. You're not just a tourist. Sophie, I'm... I'm standing here on a movie set telling you that I love you. Can't we just give this a chance? Please! We did. We did. Sophie. Okay. Cut. I have no idea who you are, but that was amazing. Thank you. I'll just... I'm sorry, guys. I'll just leave. Thank you! Very dramatic to get rain as our last goodbye. Actually, that's very normal here. - Yeah? - Yeah. Are you excited for the wrap party? Yeah, yeah. - Oh, Sophie! - Deborah, hi! - Sophie dear, sorry I'm late! - Thank you. I'm sure the studio was arguing for your character. They wanted your role but I told them it was all yours and I have the mark up, your first character poster for Firephina. "Birth of the flame". Oh my God! I know, don't you love it? And if this works, honey, we can do a prequel to the prequel. A Firephina story. What if... Hear me out now. What if, darling, we made it into a musical? Okay, too much. Or rather a film with music. You like it, I see it, I love it. Oh, my God, kill me now! I need a picture, please! Of course! You're my idol. I wanna be you when I grow up. You've no idea! Oh! You're so sweet! It's nice to meet you too. Keep that fire in you safe and one day when you're older, you can be just like Firephina. I don't wanna be like her, I wanna be like you! Okay, bye! Goddamnit! - Oh, you want me to leave. - No. No. No. Don't leave. Goddamnit is because I thought I'd never see you again. You're moving. I'm opening my place in San Miguel. You took my advice! I did. What are you doing here? Do you have a late night menu? I'm standing here in your... outdoor kitchen asking you: Do you have a late night menu? Because I'm hungry. The thing is I hate cooking. It takes longer to make the meal than it does to eat it. Great. I love you too, by the way. - Hey! - Hi! I guess I gotta try Doctor Thunder. Okay. Coming right up. - Hi, Tachi. - Hey. - How are you? - Fine. And you? I actually just convinced Jennifer Coolidge to play Mrs. Potato Head in a very dark origin story. It's gonna be good. Oh! That sounds incredible! - You're good at your job, huh? - Big time stuff. - I'm a big fan, mister Clark. - Thank you, very much. You know? I'm an aspiring actress myself. Got any tips for me? Yeah, um... Always stay in character, never try and be funny. - All right? - Thank you! Good luck! My dream is to be a dancer, you know? I'm always practicing. Dance music, why not? I love dancing. Let's see it. - Right now? - Yeah. Okay. I have to go and tell Joe. She doesn't have the rights to remix "Who Let the Dogs Out". And I said, if not her, who? Who, who, who? - Yeah? - Sure, okay. Okay! Oh! My goodness! Wow! I'm speechless. Speechless. Thank you! Cheers! Yeah. ♪ END PART 1 ♪
