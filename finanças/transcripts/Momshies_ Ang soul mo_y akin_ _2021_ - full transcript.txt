Ms. Jolene! Ms. Jolene! The set is ready! Are the guests ready? Let me double-check, Ms. Jolene. Ms. Jolene? I've talked to the nearest hotel. They don't accept exchange deals, so we can't set up your tent there. Ms. Jolene, yes! The guests are ready. What about the props? Are they ready? Props? Props! Ms. Jolene, I'll double-check! Actually, I will triple-check! Oh, God! Ms. Jolene, as I was saying, why do you want to do your makeup in that hotel? You can do it here... Ms. Jolene! Yes! The props are ready as well! What about the fans? Do they know what they have to do? Let me check, Ms. Jolene. Faster! Well, Ms. Jolene, they don't wanna sponsor us. We can always look for other sponsors. There are many... Ms. Jolene! The fans know what they have to do as well! The balloons, posters, and the buffet are all set, Ms. Jolene! I hope I haven't missed anything. You know what, Keng, as my assistant, all of these must be double, double, double, double, double, double, double, double, double-checked! Okay, Ms. Jolene! I will check it again! And you, as my manager, you should give me everything I want! I'm trying my best... But that's okay. I will talk to the hotel. Keng! Keng! You're so slow! Get all this and follow me! Let's go! I can't die! I have work to do! Get out of my way! Okay, fans, energy, ready! Shout! Madame, here we are at your lobby. Be careful, Madame. We haven't paid for those shoes yet! Wow! Our hotel is so fabulous! We have so many guests! So successful! Madame, are you seeing something that we can't see? Madame! Madame! One more "Madame" and I'll smack you! Mom. Ma. My son! What are you doing here? And who is she? She's my new girlfriend. New girlfriend is her. Right, babe? Babe, right? Yeah. Jeremiah, Jeremiah. You're annoying your mother again. Why did you bring, I'm really sorry for the lack of a term, an ugly girl here? Hey! I'm just stating a fact, Madame. My son, if she's really your girlfriend, what's her name? Emi. Emi? Her last name? Nem. Eminem! Eminem? Madame, Jeremiah's lying. My son, ask her to leave. She might need to look after… her internet café. Here's your salary. See you later! My son, why are you doing this? 'Cause, you don't pay attention to me, Mom! And most importantly, your attention is not on me! I never get to talk to you. You're working all the time! That's why I can't invite you to my game. Because we don't talk. When's your game? Madame, your schedule is full. Help me, I'll check Madame's schedule. Anyway, don't mind it and never mind. Hmm? Make sure Aunt Kimberly attends it. She's always present when I need her. At my baptism, my confirmation and my graduation! It's always her! I wish my mom was her! And most importantly, I wish she was my mom. That's so true. Jeremiah! My son! Run after him, Madame! Forget it. Huh? He runs really fast. I'll just text him. What's my schedule? Sorry, I'm late. Hey, stop! Excuse me, ma'am! What's this? It's standard social security procedure. What is she doing to Madame? What is she doing? Hold this. Just a moment. Excuse me, miss? Are you stupid or something? Security procedure? Don't you recognize me? Check your handbook, you'll find my face on it! Ma'am, I didn't know that you're the owner of this huge hotel. I'm sorry, ma'am. Innocence of the law excuses nothing. No one. Nothing! Nothing. And what's that on your face? How cheap! Where are you hiring our security from? From outer space? Why do you hire people like her for my seven-star hotel? Three stars. Seven! Seven! Ma'am, please forgive me! Look at the two of us! I really need this job! You're the bigger person. Are you saying that I'm big? Madame, she said you're big! You're heavy! You're huge! We can't fit in one frame because you're so big! You're fired! Madame! Don't say that! You're kidding, right? Madame, please! Please don't fire me! Let me go! Let me go! Let her go!

I said change the sheets, but I never said wash them. Rule number three, the floor! It should be clean, clear, and delicious. Dirty. And most important of all, the pool should never be dirty.

I'm fine with this. I think we need to go to the doctor. We'll get a transplant. I will pay for everything. Soul transplant? There's no such thing, stupid! My gosh! Sorry. We should just enjoy the switch for a while. We can switch back next week. You're really enjoying this. Of course! She's my idol! Wait! I'm really excited. I have an idea. This may work.

Old guy? I'm the only waiter who has worked here for years. But someone else was here last night. Old guy and white hair. No way! Can I have some water? No! There's no one! There's nothing! How did this happen? This is unbelievable! What are we going to do? I have an idea. I know a guy. Be careful! Oh, my gosh! This is so scary. You're the only person who could've known about a place like this! I know a sorceress as well. Do you want to meet her? What are you talking about? So scary! Good evening, girls. Let's eat. Huh? How can I help you today? Um… we have a problem. Someone cursed us and switched our bodies! And we are so stressed. Stressed? I know exactly what you need. Follow me. I feel like a rice cake. OMG! Why is my pot filled with vegetables? She's going to stew you! That's an old joke. Stop complaining! Look at me. I look like a cement mixer. We shouldn't switch back! I'll be you and you'll be me for some time. Nobody's going to pretend! We'll tell our families that our souls have switched bodies. But we're here. It's not that easy with my job. I will lose everything. My company is at stake. And my son's future is at stake as well. I think we'll need plastic surgery if this doesn't work! (blows a raspberry Huh? Oh, my gosh! Friend! It isn't working! We're stuck in each other's bodies. Darn it! Oh, you want me to switch your souls? I can't do that. What do you mean you can't? What are we doing right now? I thought you wanted to de-stress. So, I gave you a spa and a hula dance. Excuse me! You can't switch our souls? Let's go home, girls. Wait! You owe me seven thousand! What?! We're not paying you! You did nothing! Girls, let's go! Let's go! Alright! Great. Great. Try going home naked. My joints are hurting! Stop! You don't want to pay? No! Damn! Stop! No! My God! My love, you look so beautiful. I woke up like this, love! Sis, look at this! I've ironed your clothes. They're ready! Sis, I've prepared a warm bath for you. My daughter, I've prepared breakfast for you. Hmm? Madame, are you sure about this? Alright, okay. One, two. Oh my God! I'm scared. We might break the floor. One, two, three! Yeah, okay.

Sorry, we have an emergency. Alright, okay, one, two, three! Ouch! Almost there, jump! So, do I look like Karlene now? Yes, Madame. You've blended your makeup well. Oops! It's time for your daily weigh. Okay. Madame, look. You've lost weight. Lost weight? It says 300 kilograms. Well, it used to be 450. Why is this 3XL? This was the only one that could fit you. Get a tape. Yes, Madame. I'll get a tape. Let's try it. Okay, Madame. Let's squeeze it a little more. I can't breathe. Skinny! Once more. Skinny. Skinny. Once more. Once more. Skinny! Skinny. Skinny! Skinny! Good afternoon, everybody. Please meet the OIC of the company, Ms. Mylene Alcantara. Good afternoon, everybody! Please meet our OIC, Ms. Mylene Alcantara! Kimberly, we can hear you clearly. You don't need to shout. Oh, I'm sorry. As I was saying, and since we're all here… I... Where is Mr. Roque? He's in the hospital. He has a fever and cough. Oh, no! Wait, who was sitting next to him yesterday? That's you, Mr. Bato and Mr. Dela Rosa! Isolate yourselves for 14 days! Me? Starting today. Go! Finally, a vacation! When I say wow, the cat meows. Ma'am, please proceed. Good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to take over while the real CEO is out of service. I am very excited and I will do my best. And so do you. Wow, you look like a cake full of layers. Are you really okay, Madame? Yes. Let's go, Madame. I'm so excited! Hello? I just can't hide it! Please don't cancel the appointment. We're on our way. No! Hello? Hello? One minute. Are you okay? We need to move because the nurse is getting impatient. Yes! Yes, okay. Come on! Faster! Whoops! Oh? Oh! Hmm… Stop your romantic moment! You're crushing me! You're so heavy! Sorry, Ms. Jolene. Ms. Jolene, we're good, right? Hello? We're stuck in a traffic jam. If you're not here any minute, the doctor will cancel the appointment. Yes! Go ahead. I mean, no! We're coming. Everything okay? You'll be coming, right? Yes… Yes? What is this line for? Okay, next! You get the opportunity to meet Ms. Jolene! If you're negative, proceed. Next. If you're positive, proceed… to the hospital. Negative! Negative! Is this the line for free circumcision? All set, sir. You may proceed. Negative! Negative! Next. Okay, next, next! Fix your PPE and you may proceed. Okay, thank you! You're the 53rd person to use this PPE. Please wait, sir. Stay here. Excuse me! There's a fee? The picture is free. But the PPE, alcohol, and rapid test are not. We need to be safe, you know. I can't see my face in the picture! Unbelievable! Stop complaining! Do you want a receipt? Out. Next? Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty thousand! We're so rich! We can go shopping! Love. Love! We can buy whatever we want! What? Love, we can use the money for our placement fee. Uh… Love, do we really have to go? Let's go shopping! Do we really have to work abroad? We can use my idol, Jolene's face. We'll be rich, love. That's true! Yes, correct! That's my daughter! But that's not your daughter's face. So what? You're so negative! Love! Love, stop arguing with Mom. Promise me, love. Next week, we'll go to the agency together for the interview. Okay, love. Uh, I'll include it in my schedule. Damn! Damn! Good thing we had a chambermaid uniform that fits you, Madame. What did the board members say? Three out ten voted in favor of you, Madame. They think it was funny! What about the rest? Disgusted. I mean… they found it unprofessional, Madame. Three voted to close the company or undergo rebranding. The rest are still undecided. Madame, I think it's better for you to take a break while you're in that body. Because, if this continues, we might lose the stockholders and the investors. We'll lose the company. That can't happen, Kimberly. That will never happen. Kimberly. Where is Karlene? She left, sir. Who are you? Are you the new lady guard? This is... I'm the new chambermaid... Never mind, I don't care. Uh, Kimberly, give this to Karlene. Tell her to sign this ASAP. Yes, sir... What is this, sir? Jeremiah's immigration papers. Please give it... Madame will never sign these! Over her dead body! She raised him all by herself. You're just going to take the kid away? It's none of your business! Just give her the papers. Yes, sir. Kimberly, go to the bank. Go to the bank and withdraw all the money! I will go shopping! What's your PIN? Okay. Three, two, one. Is this working? Am I live? Hello, guys! Welcome to my vlog! Oh, my gosh! What is this girl doing? I'm getting goosebumps! Welcome to the house tour! You really should! Look at her, she has 700,000 views in three hours! Her videos are going viral! You never went viral, Ms. Jolene. Whatever! By the way, Ms. Jolene, your interview with Rated B is in a few days. Make sure you're pretty, and fresh, and most importantly, make sure you're fit, Ms. Jolene. My God, whenever I look at you, I see a bear. Care Bear. Why aren't you answering it, Ms. Jolene? Shut up. Don't tell me what to do. You're so loud, he might hear us! He can't hear us. Answer the call. Give it to me. Stop! Hello? - Hello? Good afternoon. Who's this? Is Jolene there? She's not here. She doesn't live here anymore. But this is her account, right? She left her phone here. But why are you answering her calls? Why do you care? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you, Auntie. If you get the chance to talk to her, can you tell her that I'm getting married next week? I don't care! Can you stop calling me? I don't want to talk to you, okay? We're just friends. I'm just your friend. And I'm so stupid to... And I'm so stupid… To make the biggest mistake. To make the biggest mistake, Of falling... Of falling in love with my best friend. Nice! - Aunt... I mean… Jolene?! Is that you? I'm not Jolene! She just asked me to deliver those lines! Sorry, Auntie. Bye! Wow! That was so emotional! They thought they needed to change to escape their miserable lives. As it turns out, change is not always the solution. But the burden is lighter I'm really sad. When they have one another. What? Sadder than her? Let's find out. Jolene, what's wrong? What's the problem? Are you okay? We all make bad decisions. I'm no exception. I left Wally to have a good life. I chose fame. But once I had everything, I realized that something was missing. I was unhappy. Because Wally is my happiness. The sad part is that… he's getting married. Oh, my! I thought we can handle this. But it feels like we're being punished. OMG! It's okay. Is this the price that I need to pay? Everything went downhill after our souls switched. I have problems as well. It's sad. But you know what women do when they're sad? What? Huh? Shopping! This is so exciting! Let's go. Hi, Madame. How may I help you? Full makeover from head to toe! Pack! Okay. Let's proceed to the makeup chair. Let's go! Thank you. Ah, excuse me. Uh, that's the waiting area for nannies. I am not... Excuse me, miss! You're judgmental! She's not our nanny. She's our friend! I thought... You thought what? Do you want me to judge you? Aw! Thank you, Ma'am. I think this one is the best. What's your bet? I don't like it. Is that Ms. Jolene? Let's go. Ms. Jolene? Ms. Jolene! Excuse me, Ms. Jolene? Can we take a selfie with you? Look at this girl! Huh? What? So many fans, right? What do I write as the caption? I know! They took a selfie with me. "Sounds like husband, but actually a has-been." Excuse me! You asked for a picture just because you wanted to bash her? Who are you? Why do you care? Let's post it! Whenever you put other people down, you reveal exactly who you are. You have a really ugly attitude. Delete the picture! Fine! Throw your phone away! Leave! That was cool! Do you have a bigger size? How about large? This won't fit. That's the largest size. If you need something bigger than this, you could go to the bedroom section. They have queen-sized blankets that might fit you. Excuse me! It doesn't matter what people look like! It doesn't matter if they're not so pretty, small, or a little huge. You should treat everyone equally. People like you are the ones who should be bashed. Sorry, Ms. Jolene. You were like this in your old vlogs. That was before! I've changed. People can change. Give her everything that she wants, we'll buy everything! Everything? Yes! Every single thing! Okay? Okay. Can you cover for me? Oh, my gosh, calm down. I couldn't just let it pass! Sister! Thank you. I had fun shopping! Are you shopping for the first time? I'm doing it with my friends for the first time. It feels good that we're together and helping each other. - Yes, sis! That's true! We get along when we don't fight. You know what, girls? What happened to us is really funny. If we wouldn't have switched, I wouldn't have gotten some time off. Now, I have a lot of time for my son. But I don't know how to be a mother. He has a basketball game that I cannot attend, because I look like this. I have realized something as well, Ms. Jolene. Your life is very difficult. Everybody notices you because you're really pretty. It's tiring. Darn it! Also, my husband really misses that face. You're very funny! How are we going to get our bodies back? We've tried going to faith healers. We have tried praying. We went back to the restaurant. But nothing has changed! You know what, maybe we need to help each other more till we don't find a solution. Yeah! Yeah, she's right. Can you help me? I have an interview with Rated B next week. If I don't go, I might lose my endorsements. You know what, count me in. Thank you. But I need your help too. I need to go to my son's basketball game. Sure! I don't have anything important to do, so I'm gonna go with you. Is that fine? Very good. This should be easy. What is that? What's that? This is your song, idol. Come on, let's sing. Oh, my gosh! It stresses me out! Please! Sing! Come on, let's sing. It stresses me out. I'll pass. Please! I play this song only when I'm sad. Come on! Let's go! You know what? The song is too good to only sing it when you're sad. So, stand up and dance! Come on! Let's go! Here's your microphone. Please. This is stressful. Dance! Come on! So stressful! This is stressful! Go! Please, come on! Do it! Alright, let's go! As time goes by, they start being kind to each other. It's true what they say. The only way to understand others is to be in their shoes. Hey! Cut it out! ♪ I will love you ♪ ♪ Momshies will love you ♪ ♪ We love you! ♪ Thank you. See you soon. ♪ We love you! ♪ Hello! Jolene, we've prepared everything for your photo shoot. Your outfits arrived today, Ms. Jolene. Just choose what you want to wear. That's so cute! I love it! I told you! But wait, wait, wait. I'm giving you guys three days off. That's so nice of you, Ms. Jolene. And I also have a surprise for you. Thank you, Ms. Jolene! And this is for you. I get one as well? Yes. Thank you. Enjoy! Help me, my son! Go, Mommy! It's my first time! You can do it! It's my first time swimming in this pool. Come on! I had no idea this pool existed. My son, help me. Mommy. Oh, my son! You're a big boy now. Mommy, thank you. Thank you for finally spending time with me and you know what? You spending time with me makes me thankful. I hope we do this often. Can you come to my basketball tryouts? Don't worry. I'll try to attend. Okay? Yes, Mommy. Oh my God! We're so rich! We can finally leave this dirt hole. Yes! More importantly, I'll finally get veneers. Thank you, sis! And we can all go abroad now! That's right. We really are going abroad. Me and your sister. I not talking about work, Clark. I meant we could take a vacation. Like the rich! Exactly like the rich people do! We're rich! We'll go to Canada. Yes. We'll go to the United States. Yes. Oh, yes... We'll go to Australia. Because we are rich! Mommy, where are you? And where you at? Why aren't you answering? And you're not answering, why? Go, Jeremiah! Go, go, go, Jeremiah! Go, Jeremiah! Go, go, go, Jeremiah! Go, Jeremiah! Go, go, go, Jeremiah! Go, Jeremiah! Go, go, go, Jeremiah! Go, Jeremiah! Go, go, go, Jeremiah! Go! Go, Jeremiah, go! Mommy! My son. Go, Jeremiah! Yes! You're so good! Whoo! Wow! I thought you weren't coming. My son is my priority. I will do anything for him. You've seen the papers I gave your nanny, right? I want an answer. Now. Yes! No! So, you agree? Um… Yes, I got the papers but I have to check them first. What's in those papers? Nothing. Stop being nosy. Come on, tell me. Luke wants my son to live with him and his mistress. They're migrating to Canada. That's the reason we were arguing about selling the hotel at the board meeting. The hotel? You're managing the hotel, right? I worked my whole life because I was scared that he'll use his money to take my son away. But this time, I might lose my son because of my carelessness. No matter what I do, I always end up failing. Huh? OMG! You're so dramatic! You have this huge body! Why do you think so little of yourself? If you don't want to lose your son, focus on him instead of the hotel. Let me do it. I got you, I got this. I'll handle it. Mom, I love you and you're loved by me. I'm not your mommy. She's your mommy. Mom, I love you and you're loved by me. I know that you are trying to make it up to me. But do you really have to wait here? Oops. Just make sure this interview airs simultaneously on TV, social media, radio and news outlets. Make sure we get lots of views. Excuse me. Don't forget our goal. Excuse me. We must go past Taylor Swift's following. JB. Excuse me, I'll talk to you later. What should I do? I'm not ready. I don't know what to do. Relax. Of course, I won't let you do this unprepared. What do you mean? I wanted you to come here to coach her. Hello, my love loves! Hello, my love loves! Mylene? Hi, love love! Is this the reason you had to leave early? Can you do what I do? Uh... Go, Mylene, show her what we practiced. Hello, my love loves! It's your girl, Jolene! I have nothing but love, love, love! Amazing! You're exactly like her! Okay. Don't worry! I'll take care of your career. I'll do my best! She'll take care of it, don't worry. Love, we're next in line. Where are you? Just relax. Everything will be fine. Mylene, I'll coach you later. Mylene, always look at her. Good day, everyone! Welcome to "My Stories." Our special guest for today is an internet viral celebrity. None other than Jolene Love. Jolene, welcome to the program. Hello, love love! Hello, Love love! We are very curious. We want to know how you started as a social media celebrity. Huh? Uh, um… Back in Quezon Province, Mm-hmm. Um, I was already into making "vedeos"... Videos? Okay. Videos. I don't know why people enjoy it, -Okay. I'm just doing what I love. Jolene, everybody is curious. Does Jolene have someone special? None, none, none really! Ly? Wally! What a cute name! Wally. I'm sure he looks cute too. Oh… He has beautiful lips. Kissable lips? Yes! Oh my God! Kissable lips! Yes and... Don't you dare! You talk too much! Macho. Good body? Macho, yes. Macho! What else? Uh… and, um… I'd die without him. Wake up! I can't live without him! I'm sure Wally is watching us right now. Where is he? Do you have something to tell him? Any message? Actually, I do. What is it? Wally… …wherever you are, um… I love you! Love?! Let's celebrate love! Jolene is in love! This is one of the most fun interviews I ever had. Thank you very much, Jolene. Oh, my goodness! There you have it, viewers. Dela Pena, Clark Michael? Jolene Love, the superstar. That's me. God… I wonder… why is it so easy for others to express what they truly feel? If it was that easy, I would've told Wally that I love him. But I can't do that because I pushed him away to chase my dreams. Jolene… you can't take him back and that's your fault. You're selfish. Why am I delivering a monologue when I can just dance my feelings out? Let's go, everyone! Let's dance! Let's enjoy life! Let's go! Let's dance! Hi, everybody! Love. Love. Where are you going, love? I'm leaving, Mylene. This house is too small for the two of us. Love, that's not true. It's really spacious. I can dance here as well. And here, love. And here. I can dance here as well! Love. Love, are you mad? I'm sorry, love. Jolene and Karlene had an emergency. I couldn't say no. I had to help them. Are we sticking to our plan of going abroad? Uh... We can work here, love. I can be a vlogger. I'll talk to Ms. Jolene. I'll ask her to split the money. But love, that's not your real face. Love, are you angry because I didn't go to the interview? Or is it because someone is finally idolizing your wife? I'm finally getting noticed. I'm mad because you think that I don't want you to be happy. I thought we'd be happy if we went abroad. Because we can finally have a family. But those plans are gone. You seem to have confused yourself with Jolene Love. Am I not allowed to be happy, Clark? I don't want anything but your happiness. I just thought that I was your happiness, not another person's face. Here. If you go to the interview tomorrow, that means Mylene is still in there. But if you don't want to go and you feel like this is what's going to make you happier, I would understand. I'll work abroad alone. Uh... Uh… This is very sad. We're down to five now. We learned that Ms. Santos and Ms. Salvador attended a party with the rest of our employees who have fever and colds. Check this out! This is Ms. Karlene, right? She has to be quarantined for 14 days. Anyway… Is this the reason why she's not here? What's this all about? Let me see. Join me, guys! Guys, join me! I don't have anybody. This girl is crazy. Excuse me? Is it trending? Hello, excuse me? Let's all be professional here and listen to what I'm saying! Professional? I think you should tell that to your boss. Roll VTR. Hi, everybody! It's fun! It's fun to be alone! That's not her! Well, clearly, that is the face that represents our company. Go! Let's dance! Yes! We forgave her when she sent an indecent OIC. But this video scandal is too much! No, I've had enough! As a member of the board, I strongly recommend closing this hotel. That's right. Let me explain! I will get to the bottle... To the bu... buttocks? To the bu... What? I'll take care of this. This has to be fixed before we give our final votes. I can't lose this hotel! I mean, Madame Karlene can't lose this hotel. Well, we will weigh our options for this company. In the meantime, let's reschedule for tomorrow. And we hope, she's there. Let's go, guys! Come on! Close this hotel. Madame! Calm down. I'm the boss. Excuse me. No! Ms. Jolene? I'm coming. You have a visitor, Ms. Jolene. Okay. I'm coming. Just wait a second. Surprise! Mother… why are you here? Mother? Where's my daughter? This is the problem I was telling you about. This is the body Jolene got when the souls switched. Do you mean that she's my daughter? That's right. I don't get it. You really won't understand. I suggest you go back home. I'll explain everything later. She's so cold. She really is Jolene. Honey. Come back home. Wally's getting married tomorrow. He had come to our house yesterday. He was begging us to let him talk to you. He saw your interview. He's been coming to our house for the past year. He asks if you're back every time. He's the only person you have loved. Are you really going to let him go? Mother… he let go of me. He immediately replaced me. You're being unfair. He loved you and made you happy. He woke up one day without you by his side. You're now rich and famous. But I know you. I know that you are not happy here. Jolene Mae, it's hard to live a sad life. I just want you to be happy. When there's a problem, we always ask "how"? We always forget that the most important question is… Why? Why did this happen to us? I want my old life back. I want my old body back. I'm happy to have my idol's face. But because of this face, I think I'm forgetting the dreams I had with my husband. Tell me about it. Luke is taking Jeremiah away from me. My hotel is closing. Everything's gone. And I can't do anything about it. OMG! Why? The board saw a video of me dancing wildly. I'm sorry. I was so wasted that night. I drank a lot and danced by myself. I was out of my mind. I was so heartbroken. I'm so sorry. This is all our fault. Maybe the reason why we switched souls is that we belittle each other's problems. But now that this has happened, I've realized how hard it is to be in someone else's shoes. It takes one's shoes to know shoes. What I mean is that if we didn't fight the first time we saw each other, we could've been best friends and soul sisters. She's right! What am I going to do? I have an interview with the agency tomorrow. I can't go! My husband will leave me! Don't worry. If you need me, I will help you. Really? But wait. I just remembered that I have a major meeting tomorrow with the board members. I'll help you. I'll take care of it. I want to make it up to you. OMG! I have a wedding to stop tomorrow. Right. It's your first love, Wally's wedding. I'll help you. Don't worry. OMG! Thank you! And we are… Soul sisters! That's great! I'm sorry. Finally, they've realized the reason why their souls switched. And now, for one last test… If you really love him, you should've fought for him! I'll wait for you. If you don't come, it means we're over. I told you it's over. She's completely booked! She's not available anymore. Please don't disconnect, I'll pay... JB, I need your help! Drop your phone, now! Wait, I'll call you back. I'll call you later. What is it, JB? Hold on, I'm so confused! Hello? Hello. Is this Mylene Dela Pena? I would like to remind you of your final interview at 2:00 p.m. today. Actually, you already have a job offer in Dubai. You just need to come here to sign the contract and take a picture. Okay? Okay. Okay, bye! Buh-bye! Approved! Huh? Jeremiah? My son. I need your help. Mom? Madame? No way! Come on! Let's go! Ms. Jolene? There's Ms. Jolene! Keng! OMG! We switched again! What do we do? This is perfectly okay. We know each other now. Don't worry. We will win this battle. Huh? Soul sisters? Soul sisters! Good morning, board members! Thank you all for waiting. Where's the CEO? I thought we'd meet her today. Ooh. Chill. Without further ado, Madame Karlene. Just pretend to talk. Move your mouth and I'll dub for you just like a K-drama. You can do this! Mm-hmm. You can do it. Go! Good morning, everyone! I'm sure you're wondering why I wasn't here. I would love to explain and tell you everything, but you might not believe me. So, let me show you the real me. My fellow board members, my name is Karlene Tabiano, CEO of Megarich Hotel. But also a mother. We're here today to decide the fate of this hotel. To some of you, this is just an investment, an income-generating building, but to me, it's my life. Well, because of my love for this hotel, I forgot that I was a mother before I was a CEO. So, I've decided to give all my shares to my ex-husband, Luke. I will spend all my time making it up to my son. So, I will step down as the president of Megarich Hotel. Is she stepping down? I think she said she's stepping on the ground. You're on mute! I'm literally stepping down. Wait! Hold up! Just a minute! Ma, I don't care if you're in a different body every day. I just want to let you know and I want you to know that you are the best CEO this hotel ever had. Proud of you Mom and you make me proud, Mom. We've decided to retain our shares, and still put you as the CEO, Madame Karlene. Thank you very much! We appreciate that! Especially now that I've decided to study here in Manila instead. After graduation, I can handle the business myself. What do you think, Dad? I'm leaving. Nancy, let's go! Walkout? Get us some Korean barbecue, Madame. Mommy! Mommy, I'm so happy! My son, I'm here. Mommy! As I was saying, I'm so happy and the happy is me. I love you so much! Thank you! Success! Yes, Ms. Jolene! You were amazing! Well done! I agree! It was all you. OM! Why? What's the matter? Time... It's two o'clock. Why? Two o'clock! I'll be late for my appointment. Oh, appointment! Oh my God! OMG! Oh my God! He looks familiar. Let's go! We don't have much time! We'll discuss it later! You'll be late, Mylene! Let's go! It is him! The old guy from our birthday. Why is he helping us now? What's this? Wait a minute! You switched our souls, right? OM! You're the one who messed us up! Did I mess with you? Or did I help you? Well, we did become sisters. Soul sisters! Watch out! Magic! Amazing! He passed through! Did you see that? We have to make it really quick! Um, Madame, once you get to the church, tell Wally that I love him and will do so forever! Don't worry! I'll handle it! Thank you! Jolene! Please do well in the interview. It's important to me, to Clark and to my whole family. I got you. Soul Sisters! Whoo-hoo! Faster! Love! Love! Love! Love! Love, it's me! Love, you're here! Love! Love, it's me! I'm your love. Oops! Love, love! Love! I'm glad we made it! I can't go in with this body. Jolene, go! Me? I don't want to. Okay! Thank God, you're here. OM! Excuse me, sir! Wait! Excuse me, sir. Please give me a chance. Um, please interview me. I can answer any question. What interview? We screen talents. Talent? Wait a minute! I can do that! Sorry… But we're looking for a girl group. The next 2ne1. Let's not waste each other's time, okay? Girl band? Wait a minute! Stay there! Did you say girl band? Ladies and gentlemen, the Soul Sisters! ♪ Chuva choo choo ♪ ♪ Yeah!

No. Ma'am, please don't cry here. I just mopped the floor. Let me emote for a second. Jolene? Wally? Uh, is it really you? What do you think? I waited for you till the last minute. But you didn't come. So… I waited some more. Does that mean you didn't... I can't marry someone else. I think about you every day. I backed out at the last minute. So, now I'm going to have to pay for everything. But that's okay. Because I love you. So, why don't you hug me? I love you forever, babe. Is this really you? Yes, babe. Are you sure? Am I sure? Fate brings people together so that they can learn from one another. They are what you call soulmates. A soulmate can be a spouse, a boyfriend, a friend, or a sister. Soul sisters. Thanks to them, we learned that problems strengthen a family's bond. Yes, Mom? They taught us that a parent's love can't be measured by material things. Instead, we should give our family time, attention, and love… Hello! Hi! Pretty. Hello. Madame. Hi! Hello! Hi! Hi. You're so pretty. You really are. Thank you! This is my god-mommy, Kimberly. Hi! It's time for your interview. Come with me. Come on, sit here. Thank you. Where's your résumé? …even if someone else makes them feel loved. Hi, JB! I just want to say thank you for saying yes to the deal. Thank you too, JB. I wanna ask you something. Is it okay to ask you out for dinner? Mommy! Let's go! The wedding is about to start. Okay. Is she here already? There she is! Oh my God! Soulmates also teach us that… Hi! Love can be really challenging, but if you fight for it, you will put a ring on it.
