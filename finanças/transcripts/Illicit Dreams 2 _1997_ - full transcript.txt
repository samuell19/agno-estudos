(suspenseful instrumental music) (cars honking) - Dull party. - Oh, it wasn't too bad. How often do you run into somebody that has the same interests you do. - We do have a lot in common. - I'd like to think we do. - Well, this is me. It was really nice of you to walk me to my car. I heard a rumor that chivalry was dead. - It was just a rumor, besides, it's late. You can't be too careful these days. - I thought you might be trying to pick up on me. - Thought had crossed my mind. - What are the thoughts? (bushes rustling) Thought I heard something. - There's no one around. (bushes rustling) - Listen, I really gotta go. I feel like an idiot for asking. I'm terrible with names. - Paul Coslin, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You better call. - I will. (ominous instrumental music) What the hell are you doing here? Oh, my God. No. No. (gun firing) (ominous instrumental music) (suspenseful instrumental music) - Good, that's beautiful. (upbeat instrumental music) Good, good. There you go, keep moving. Keep going. Beautiful, roll over. Keep moving, on your knees, there you are, sit up. Nice. Keep moving. Grab your shirt off. There you go, nice. Let me see the jeans. Yeah, move your hair, yeah, there you go.

There you go, keep going. Good. Look, slow down, not so fast. Beautiful. Good. All right, let's do the jeans now. - [Model] Dammit. - Terri, give her a hand with that button there. - You wanna try? - You had your chance. - Here, Terri, why don't you insert on that film? - [Terri] Mm-hmm - Okay. - So, alone at last. - Can we get back to work? - Only if we have to. - Yeah, we have to. - All the way off. (sultry instrumental music) - Let me help you. (phone ringing) - Hey, you gonna get that? - Jeff? Jeff, the jeans, all the way off? - Huh? Oh, Jesus, the phone. Hang on, gimme one second. Gimme just a minute, honey. Good afternoon, Reed Studio. - Busy? - Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am Stan. - Probably. She is the great looking model, right? - Well, as a matter of fact, I am. - Oh, you bastard. - What a job, have I told you that you're like the luckiest guy I know. - Well let's see, only about 100 times now, Stan. - Well, you just got luckier. - [Jeff] Why? What's going on? - You got a meeting tomorrow, 12 o'clock, Sawyer advertising. - Hey, they're good. - Yeah, they're good. Wear your best suit. You're meeting with some ad exec, named Lynn Barrett. - What's the product? - New perfume. Oh, great. Okay. What's the address? - 122 Bushley. - All right. All right, great, we'll I'll be there, Stan. - Hey, Jeff, the model? - Yeah. What about her? - What's she wearing? - Hey, Stan, this isn't a 900 number, okay? - Is she my type? Stan they're all your type. - So true. - Look, I have to go, okay? Bye-Bye. Sorry about that. (ominous instrumental music) - No, these aren't any good, let me see these. There we go, that's the one. I like this one. - Yeah, me too. - Good. - Oh, I'm late. I meet Daniel for dinner. - Oh, you're gonna get going? - Yeah. Are you staying? - No, I'll go out with you, let's go. (ominous instrumental music) - So that's why I walked. (faintly speaks) - Well, you're gonna have to watch it with that one. - Oh, I can watch myself, I just... Mr. Late. - Yeah. - You're late. - I know, I'm sorry. I had a tough time getting outta the office. How you doing, Jeff? - Hey, Dan. I'm starving, you ready? - Hey, why don't you come with us? - Yeah. Come on. - I'm not hungry. - You need to get out more. - Who, me? - Yes, you. You need to get a life. Kate would want it. Oh, look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. - It's okay. - Come on, give the guy a break. He doesn't want to go. - You sure? - Positive. Now get outta here, have a good time. - See ya later. - See ya. - Bye-Bye. (ominous instrumental music continues) (gun firing) (man groaning) - Can I help you? - Yes. I have an appointment to see Lynn Barrett, senior advertising. - Oh, penthouse, all the way to the top. - Great, thanks very much. (elevator beeping) - Mr. Reed- - Please, call me Jeff. - Jeff, are you staring at me for some reason? - I'm not a very good reader, I'm sorry. - That's okay, don't apologize. I haven't been stared at like that for a long time. - Really? I find that very hard to believe. So, nice flowers. Were they a gift? - It's from the office. I just transferred here from New York. - I thought maybe they might be from somebody special. - I just get out of a really bad relationship, and I don't wanna get into another one, so can we get back to this? - Sure. - Okay. I remember this one. - Oh yeah, that's one of my favorites. - This is good, real good. - It's supposed to be. - My firm has just been hired on to promote a new perfume hitting the market. - What's it called? - Dangerous. And what I need are some new photographs that can really put a fire under my creative team. Do you think you'd be interested in that? - I'd be very interested. - Oh, good. Good. I'll have my legal send the contracts to your agent. It's very nice to meet you. - Pleasure meeting you too. You free for lunch? - I have plans. - What about dinner? - I don't think so. - Okay. Well think about it. Dinner sometime, my schedule's pretty open. - Maybe. - Maybe, maybe means yes. - Maybe means, maybe. (intense instrumental music) (glass breaking) (glass breaking) - [Announcer] The movie, "Still Dawn" continues now, with "Night Eye 7," starring, Andrew Stevens and Chick Panera, right after- (soft instrumental music) - [Terri] Maybe, huh? - Yeah, that's what she said. - That means yes. - Yeah. Think so? - Definitely. - Yeah. That's what I thought too. - What's she like? - Well, she seems nice enough. - I'm nice. - Hey, shh, you're supposed to be sleeping. Go to sleep. - It's been a while for you. - For what? - Liking somebody. - I don't know if I like her, you know? I mean, I am kind of curious though. - You know what curiosity did to the cat? - I think you should send her flowers. - Well, I'm way ahead of you on that one. Dear, you go back to sleep, please. (soft instrumental music continues) (Lynn knocking) - Hi. - Hi, I got the flowers. Don't give up easily, do you? - No, no, no, I don't. I'm sorry, please, come on in. - Thanks. Nice place. - So did you give you more thought to having dinner with me? - I don't think it's such a good idea for us to get involved. - Well, I'm not talking about getting involved. I'm just talking about eating. You do eat, don't you? - So it wouldn't be a date then? - Mm-mm, what'd you say? - I'm hungry. - Good. I know this great place. - Yeah, where? (romantic instrumental music) - Here, looks like you used some more wine. So tell me about New York. - What do you wanna know? - You said you just got out of a bad relationship. - That's an understatement. I thought I'd met Mr. Right, for a while, anyway. - I'm prying, aren't I? - No. Don't apologize. We were in love. We were committed to each other and everything. And then he just started seeing another woman. - Well, that's hard. - He was a bastard. I'm sorry. - It's okay, don't be sorry. - I guess it's pretty hard for me to talk about it. Paul meant everything to me. It's your turn. So who's the girl in the picture? - The what? - The picture? - Oh, the picture. That's Kate, my wife. - Oh. - She's gone now. - Gone. - Yeah. She had a car accident a few years ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. Do you think about her a lot? - Yeah, I do. - It's hard letting go, isn't it? - Well, it's getting kinda late. - It's not too late. - Well, do you really think it's a good idea? - Let's find out. - I have to warn ya, it's been a while for me. - I'll go slow. (soft instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) - You're the one. - What? - Nothing. Nothing. (phone ringing) - Hello, Reed Studio. No, he's not in. Can I take a message? Yes. I'll tell him. Well, look what the cat dragged in. - Good morning, everybody. - You mean, good afternoon. Who's this Lynn Barrett. - Well, she's the one with Sawyer advertising. You know, the client who gave us the job for the perfume. Why? - Well, she called. - Probably just returning my calls. - 10 Times. - You're kidding? - She must have liked those flowers. - Mm-mm-mm. Give me one minute, okay? - Oh, we're set up over here, whenever you're ready. (ominous instrumental music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Sawyer Advertising. - Yes. This is Jeff Reed for Lynn Barrett. - Hold please. - Sure. - Jeff Reed's on line three. - Thank you. Hi. - Hi. I woke up a little late this morning, called your office, but they said you were in meetings. - Yeah, I know, did you get my message? - Oh, yeah, I did. Hey, I was wondering if you weren't busy tonight, Maybe we could get together, see a movie, and have a nice dinner or something. - Tonight? I already have plans. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. I'm sorry. - That's okay, what about this weekend? - Oh, what about it? - Look, can I see you? - Who's Terri? - My assistant, why? - Mm, she sounds pretty. - Yeah, she is. Well, what about it? What about this weekend, can I see you? - Let me think about it. - I was wondering how many times did you call this morning? - Twice, why? - Terri said you called about 10 times. - I'm a little busier than that. I wonder why she would say that. - I don't know. Maybe you just sound like somebody's that's been calling a lot. - I miss you. - Yeah, I miss you too. I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye. - Bye. - You ready? - Yeah. Yeah. Let's shoot this thing. (ominous instrumental music) (ominous instrumental music) What is this? - Come on in, the water's great. - [Jeff] What are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing? - How did you get in? - I wanted to surprise you. What's the matter? Don't you like surprises? - You see, it is not that I don't like surprises. It's just that- - Well, when it comes to certain things, I can be very, very impatient. (both moaning) (door knocking) - Hey, Ter, it's me, I'm here. - Your friend called. - Who? - Take a guess. What is up with you two? - Don't know, what do you mean? - She's called 20 times. - You know, I don't know. She's just a client. (phone ringing) - Must be a real workaholic. - Reed Studios. - Last night was incredible. - Yeah, it was. Hey, did you call this morning? - Yes. Why? - Well, I got like 20 messages from you. - I didn't call you 20 times. Is that what that slut bitch assistant of yours told you? - Well, excuse me, my slut bitch assistant. Look, Lynn, I think you got some very serious problems. Okay? Deal with them. - Jeff. Jeff? Hello? - [Operator] If you'd like to make a call- (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - Just let it ring. - Jeff. Is everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine. It's just an annoying salesman, I don't feel like dealing with him right now. - Do you want me to turn the machine on? - Yeah. No, it's okay. Those the jeans? - Yeah. Take a look. I think you'll like it. - Okay. She's great looking and she likes you. I don't see the problem. - I just think there's something wrong with her - Really? And what's that? - I think she's psycho. - Huh? One small drawback. Come on, seriously. - I am serious, Stan. Look, I met her, I liked her. Okay, fine. I thought I'd ask her out and take a chance. I mean, you know me. I've not really gone out with anybody since Kate died. - I know. - I mean, she tells me that she just got of a bad relationship, and that she doesn't wanna get involved with anybody. I should have listened to her. - Okay. So you had dinner and- - Okay. And I slept with her. - Again, so what? People have been known to have sex. - The problem is, Stan, she won't stop calling me. I mean, she calls me at home. She calls me at work. I get home last night from work. There's a little candlelit dinner at the table, and she's out back swimming naked in my pool. - Nothing on? - Naked usually means nothing, Stan. - Jeff, I should have your problems. - Get this. She tells me she loves me. I just met the woman. I mean, she doesn't even know me. - You're a likable guy. - Shut up, Stan. - It's just hard to imagine that this is some big problem. Just tell her that you're not interested, that you don't mix business with pleasure. What's she gonna do, kill ya? - You never know. - You've seen way too many movies. - Yeah, you don't know this woman. - All kidding aside, are you gonna be able to work with her? - Mm-mm, no way. - Lynn Barrett is the creative vice president of Sawyer Advertising, they're huge. - I know. I said, "No way." - It's a lot of money. Are you gonna just kiss it all away, because some woman's got a thing for ya? - Stan, can you get me outta the contract or not? I'm asking you as my friend. - This girl's really got you spooked. - Yup, like you would not believe. - We haven't signed the contract yet. I'll call 'em tomorrow. I'll tell him you're out. - Thank you. - But it's a lot of money. - Come on, let's go get some lunch. - You're buying. - That's a deal. (ominous instrumental music) You almost done? - Yeah. How's that? - Let me see. Perfect. - I can't wait till we're done with this catalog work. It's so boring. - What, you don't find this exciting? - Say, do you know what day it is today? - It's Wednesday. - No. - What do you mean, it's not Wednesday? - It is, but what's special about it? - I don't know. - I'll give you a hint. Daniel's coming over tonight and taking me to dinner, a really nice dinner. - Oh, it's your anniversary. - No. - It's Daniel's birthday. - I knew you'd forget. - Let me think about it for a minute. Let's see, could it be your birthday? - Oh, Jeff. - Happy birthday. - Oh, man. - Now if you don't like it, you can take it back. I have the receipt. - No, no, no. It's beautiful. (ominous instrumental music) - Ta-Dah. - Very nice How you doing, Jeff? - Daniel. Good. Where are you guys off to? - We're heading to Rudy's. - It's a pretty nice place. - Yeah, tell me about it. It took me a month to get a reservation. - That reminds me, I still have to change. - Well, I gotta get going guys, okay? - Hurry up, we gotta rush. - Have a good time, I'll see you in the morning. - See ya, Jeff. - I'll only be a minute. - I'll be right here. (ominous instrumental music) - Honey. - Wow. Do you like it? - Wow. - I am having in trouble with the zipper, can you help me? - I've got a better idea. (intense instrumental music) - Do we have time? - We can be a little late. (Terri moaning) (ominous instrumental music) - Can we talk? - Aout what? - About us. - There is no us. - Don't say that. Look, Lynn, I'm sorry, but you have to go. Well, what are you doing tonight? - I've got plans. - What plans? - Goodnight. Lynn. Break 'em, I have to be with you. - I'm sorry. I can't do that. It's about business, about the new campaign. I have some ideas that I have to go over with you. Jeff, please. - You should get somebody else for the job. - I don't want anybody else. - I can recommend a lot of very good photographers. - Don't make me beg. - I made up my mind. - No, don't do this to me. - Get up. - No. - Get up. Get up, would you stop it? Just get up. Come on, get up, get up. - I'll do anything, anything. - Just calm down, please. - I love you. - You love me? You don't even know me. - I can be just like her. - Like who? - Kate. Just get the fuck away from me, okay? Get the- (Lynn screaming) (somber instrumental music) (door banging) (Lynn crying) - I don't think he's sleeping with her. Ms. Barrett? - I heard you. - I don't think that- - Listen, let's just get this one thing straight, okay? I'm not paying you to think. - Yes, ma'am. - Give me proof. (ominous instrumental music) - Jesus Christ. What are you doing, sneaking up on me like that for? - I wanted to surprise you. - Well, you did. I'm sorry. I've had too many surprises lately. - Oh, Terri said that these were done. - Sure, you wanna look at 'em? - Yeah. Here, use this. - Thank you. These are great. - Yeah. Look at this one right here. Yeah. - Can I have a few of these, please? - Oh, I don't know. - I'll make it worth your while. - I'm just kidding, do me a favor, circle the ones you like, and I'll send 'em to the lab tomorrow. - Listen, what if I want to make it worth your while? - Well, I'll say I have to take a raincheck. My life right now is pretty crazy, but thank you anyway. - Hey, you look a little tired. - Yeah. Well, I feel tired. - That's something I should be worried about. - Well, I'm been sleeping too well lately. It's like, you know, you ever felt like you were in a dream, and you just couldn't wake up from that dream? - It was a good dream or a bad dream? - It's a bad one. It's a nightmare. - You know what? Let's do this, let me take you for a drink. - I can't, I got a lot of work to do. - Uh-Uh, no, I cannot stand to be turned down twice in one day. So you're gonna come with me, come on. - Okay. But only one. - Okay. One real big one, okay? - So where are you gonna take me? (Eria speaking faintly) (ominous instrumental music) - Isn't this cozy? So aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? Hi, I'm Lynn. - Erica. - How do you know Jeff? Well, I- - We were just leaving. - We need to talk. - I don't have anything to say to you. - I don't think your friend here will mind, will you? Did he tell you that I'm pregnant with his baby? - Stop it. - I don't know what's going on here, but- - That's obvious. - [Jeff] Leave her out of this, please. - Do you think that you are the only whore that he has had behind my back, do you think that? - Excuse me. - You just stay the hell away from him, you got that? - Lynn. If you don't get outta here, I'm gonna call. the cops. - I'm not leaving, until we talk. - Get out of here. - Jeff. - It's okay, he hits me all the time, I'm used to it. I like it, rough. - Woman, please. Leave me alone. - I'm sorry. I gotta get outta here. Jeff. I'm sorry. - Erica, wait, wait. It's not what you think. - It's so funny. (laughs) Oh, God, what? It's a joke. It's a joke, Jeff, I'm not really pregnant. It's not very funny, I guess. Jeff, oh, lighten up. Come on, it's a joke. Honey? (ominous instrumental music) - [Voicemail] You have 67 messages. - [Lynn] Hi, honey, it's me. I'm just calling to tell you that I was thinking about you. Are you thinking about me? I love you. Jeff, it's me. How about dinner tonight? Let me know. I can't wait to see you. I don't feel so well, call me. Hey, hun, calling to tell you that you are on my mind. I love you. Jeff, are we still on dinner? I can't wait. (voicemail slamming) (ominous instrumental music) - Son of a bitch. God. (ominous instrumental music) (objects thudding) - Hello? (objects thudding) Jeff, is that you? (Terri screaming) Who's out there? Who's out there? Who's out there? - [Daniel] Terri, you all right in there? Hey, I'm glad to see you too. What's wrong with you? - Someone's in here. - [Daniel] What are you talking about. - In here, they tried to get in, I locked the door. - When? - Just before you came. - I'm calling the police. - Let's just get outta here. I'm tell Jeff about it later. - It's this neighborhood. I don't like you working late. Oh, my God. (door knocking) - Hey Terri. - Hey. - Come in. And you're positive you heard somebody? - Jeff. I'm totally positive. Whoever it was, even shredded the jacket you gave me. - They shredded your jacket. Oh, I'll get you another one. Was anything taken? - Nothing was taken. - And you're okay? - I was just pretty scared. - Yeah, I bet. Well, as long as you're okay, that's the most important thing. - Who would do something like that? - I don't know, it's probably just some kids. (ominous instrumental music) - Excuse me, excuse me, sir. You can't go back there. Sir. I need to announce you. Sorry, he was very insistent. - That's all right. - It's a nice surprise. - Did you break into my studio last night? - How would I do that? Did you get my call? - Yeah. All 300 of them. - What are you talking about? - You know god damn well what I'm talking about. - Call security. - Did you break into my studio last night? - You know, you need help. Have you thought about seeing someone? - Where's my picture, hmm, the one of Kate and I? What? - Is it in here, huh? I don't see it there. What, is it here? I didn't see it here. Where's my god damn picture? - I don't see it here, do you? - Maybe it's here, huh? No, it's not here. Would it be here? No, I don't see it there. Where is my god damn fucking picture? - Stop it. - You stop, all right? You stop. I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't want to hear you. I don't wanna know you exist. - And please show Mr. Reed out. - Don't bother, just leaving. (ominous instrumental music) All right, who are you? - Hey, hey, don't hurt me. God. I'm getting too old for this. - That's not what I asked you. - Look, I'm a detective. Your wife hired me. - My wife. - She thinks you're cheating on her. - My wife. - What's so funny? - My wife is dead. Lynn Barrett, right, right? - She said you were married. Said you were having problems and, oh, Jesus. You're not her husband. - No. I'm just a fool that went out with her one time. Once. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Yeah. Let me give you some advice, my friend. Find yourself another case and just walk away from this one. - And listen, you'll be very careful, Mr. Reed, as she is a very determined woman. - Yeah, I'll do that. (ominous instrumental music) (intense instrumental music) (Lynn screaming) (glass breaking) (ominous instrumental music) - Oh, my God. What went on in here? (Lynn screaming) (Terri screaming) - All right, you wait here, I'll go get it. - Oh, man. - Where is she? - He can help you. - I'll be with you in a second. I need you to run this down the lab for me. - All right. - [Detective] You see it over there? - I'm gonna try and get some prints on that. - No, you won't find any. - Now why do you always have to be such a pessimist? - Why not. - Detective, how is she? - She's okay, she's down at Southside Hospital. She had time to call 9-1-1, but she didn't see the attacker. I'm gonna treat it like a robbery. - This wasn't a robbery. - How are you so sure? - Because Stan, there's Hasselblad, okay? - There's your what? - It's an expensive European camera worth over 6,000 bucks. I used to be a police photographer. - You think she did it? - I know she did. - The problem is, who is she? (ominous instrumental music) - Can't believe you would say that. - He also said that you were stalking him. - I don't believe him, do you? If anything, it's the other way around. - How so? - He asked me out. I refused. And then he started sending me flowers and calling. I went out with him once. Once and that was it. So I thought, and then the call started, day and night. He started showing up places where I had been, as if he was following me. It got pretty scary. - He says you broke into his studio before the other incident. - Mr. Brady, the man is sick. He is probably a manic depressive. - Well, if he was stalking you, why didn't you call us? - Because at first, I thought Jeff was harmless, and I figured that the police have more important things to worry about, don't you think? - Well, that was very considerate of you. - If you would like to find out how harmless Jeff can be, then why don't you talk to my secretary? No better yet, why don't you talk to the security guard here, okay? - I'll do that. - Good. Well, if you excuse me, I have some business to take care of, thank you. (ominous instrumental music) (train hoking) - Who is she? - I don't see the problem. - What's the matter? Don't you like surprises? - Hey. Are you free for lunch? - It's don't think that's such a good idea for us to get involved. - Must be a real workaholic. - I don't want anybody else. I can be just like her. - Like who? - Kate. (echoes) I love you. (echoes) - You don't know me. (echoes) - No. - What else do you remember? - She said that she just got outta this bad relationship with some guy. - In New York? - I guess. - And what was the guy's name? - Oh, damn. She told me, I just can't remember what it was. (door knocking) Can I help you? - Yeah. - I've been looking for you. That girlfriend of yours. You're lucky she didn't press charges. - Look I don't know what she told you, but I guarantee it's a lie. - It's not what she told me. Secretary told me about that little temper tantrum of yours. - Look, I went to her office to get a picture that she stole from me. - They had to call security. - I don't think you're understanding me here. - I'm trying real hard, friend. - So what are you gonna do? - Give me some time to think about it. I'll let you know what I come up with. - I don't have any more time. - You could end up with all the time in the world. I'll catch up with you. - Screw him. I'm gonna dig up some info on her, I'll call her boss. The least I can do, is get her fired. - Paul. - Paul. - That's the guy's name from New York, Paul. - Oh, well now we got something. - [Assistant] Our record show that she asked for the transfer. Let me get Diane, she was a friend of Lynn's. Hang on. - Hello? - Hi, this is Stan Cooper. I'm a friend of Lynns and I was hoping you could help me. I'm a little bit worried about her. - I didn't know her very well and nobody did. - Well, it's just that she's been acting strange lately. She keeps mentioning a guy that she used to go out with named Paul. - Paul Koslin? - Yeah. Yeah. That's him. Would you by any chance know I get in touch with Paul? - Paul's dead, he was murdered last year. Lynn was pretty upset. - Do they know who did it? - No. He was mugged, shot to death. Another unsolved crime in New York. - Well, you've been a great help. David Sawyer, please. - Do you know some guy named Stan Cooper? - Sounds familiar. I think he's an agent. - Well, he's been asking all kinds of questions about you. He's talking to David right now. I just thought you should know. - Thank you. (ominous instrumental music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, Jeff? It's Stan. - Stan, were the hell are you? - At the office. Listen, something's come up. - Yeah, something or someone? - I got lucky, go figure. And she's great looking. - Yeah, I guess I can't wait till tomorrow. - Listen, I dug up some pretty good stuff on our friend. Yeah, like what? - Later. Hey, Jeff, keep your doors locked, okay? Hey, Laura, come on in. (ominous instrumental music) (glass breaking) (Lynn moaning) (Lynn moaning) (Lynn exclaiming) (Lynn moaning) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Mr. Reed, and this is Detective Brady. Yeah. I got some bad news for you. Your friend, Stan Cooper, he's been murdered. - Stan's dead? - Yeah. You're the only one I knew to contact.
