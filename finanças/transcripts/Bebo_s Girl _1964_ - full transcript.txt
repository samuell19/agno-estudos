Well, since I'm here, I'll wait. - Are you her daughter? - Yes - Is not his mother? - No. Will needle and thread? While this hope may sew. Pass. No, leave. Do not bother, I do it. Living in the mountains, the partisans and even learned to sew. Get on there. I was the poor fellow Sante. Once told me about you, but I thought... The truth is that do not look much. - Sure, it was not my brother. - Excuse me? How was it not his brother? It was my brother. Yes, was the son of my mother, my father only gave her surname. Well, for me was like a brother. - Done. - Thanks. How did you find? For a farmer in Mount Espertole I was there when he was arrested. We learned much later that he had been shot. - Where's Mom? - It has been this guy. I co-Sante. Enchanted young, I'm glad to see him. Mara, bring a lamp, which is not seen nothing. We have no electricity, those damned Germans, before leaving, he blew up everything. _ Sit. - So I fought with Sante? - Yes And I was with him when arrested at Mt Espertole. - Are you from around here? - Of Volterra.

Good night. Understand that for a mother losing a child is a serious blow. _ It was hard for everyone. You'll have to settle for what is, a bowl of soup and half a glass of wine. _ Yes, the menu of the poor. The rich people eat meat and poultry, and the poor, cabbage soup, and now even without salt, because there is no black market. _ I have endured for 20 years but our time has come. We are liberated from the fascists, threw out the Germans and now we start to weed for those who exploit the people, once and for all. - What do you do? - Are you afraid? Is discharged. This... You set many accounts, and still not finished with the fascists. Here, it present. It parachute silk. Have you brought me? - Do you like? - Yes, I'll make a blouse. Starting to feel very tired. I undertook the journey this morning. - Thanks for the gift. - Nothing. I waited for over a month, then I started thinking I would never return. Maybe it was true that he had come by Sante and I did not care. was sure that if I saw him again, know what I thought. Bebo But no sign of life. - Mara, where you going? - I'm here. - No, you're going out. - No, I am here and weighed. - Hi Mara. - So you've finished working? - There are striking. Sal - I can not.

Nonsense! - Then I shall go to Liliana. - Then go. I'll go, but I bet you hate. - No, but if I care. - Oh, stupid! I have hurt! I swore you would not talk more with Liliana, but I saw them together. - It gives me more satisfaction than you. - Yes .. is half-squint. Do not be coy, that I've got good hand. But nobody knows, if you tell, tell you're a liar. Bye. Good morning. - I was looking for his father. - It's in Colle Back tonight. I need him, but I have time I can not wait. I came on a motorcycle with a friend, pick me up at noon. - He has shaved. - Oh yes! When we were partisans shaved little, so sometimes I forget. _ I wear the shirt, you see how good it is. What shirt? The one I did with the silk gave me. - What's left? - Okay. - Are well all at home? - Yes - What about your girlfriend? - I have no girlfriend. I have not had time to think about those things. Last year at this time, I had left home. because of the fascists. But now he has long gone. Yes, but what do you think?, Working day and night I go to the party. Well, today has not gone to work. Well, today I wanted ... had long wanted to visit him. Stay here, do not move. Prove it. Hello, Liliana, what are you doing? Hello. Look, I bought 4 meters, do you like? And these shoes? Do you like? You should also buy a pair. Now I have time, I'm with someone. - Who? - With him. Mara, listen, you're wrong going out with the first comer. - It's not the first comer. - For the second time you see it. Bye. It is the prim, but neither dogs ignore him. Where'd he go? To ask whether they served in the canteen meals. Eat with us. - No, I do not bother them. - Come on. Come on. - What? - Nothing. Have I slept long? It must be late. The three and a half! My friend should have already arrived. It came on a motorcycle. How funny! I hope that has not happened. - Maybe you came and went. - I did not hear any bike. Ah, finally! Here he comes. - Hello, Bebo. - Hello. Good evening. - Bye. My compliments to your father. - Bye. - Anybody? - What do you want? - Do you have eggs to sell? - How many do you want? - All you have. - I'll see. The summer ended and I could not see him again. autumn, instead of it, came Carlino. supplies provider of Volterra. - Are you Mara? - Yes This sends Bebo. If you want to send a response, I am in the canteen. was the first letter I received in my life, and trembled at the thought of reading words of love. "Dear Mara: for which I sent this letter is a bit of salt... I got on the black market for his mother; and for you these lines. I hope to soon have the opportunity to see you and your family. Greetings, Bebo. I replied that I had done wrong so upset, because now they are getting salt in Monte Guidi. It was not true, of course, but must learn to deal more with me and about my father. Carlino returned a couple of times, Bebo because if he spoke little, write less. Another letter of Bebo. - Here. - Bye and thanks. Wait a minute, ma'am, I ask you something. - Do you know Bebo long? - Three months ago, why? Are not you afraid to go out with him? In Volterra, girls do not dare. - Did not matter to me. - Why tell me this? - For your sake, child. The hands off! Hey, I have misinterpreted, I'm married, and I would not bother the girl of Bebo. Poor fool. Castellucci, E. In winter, when it started working again, began to write regularly, once a week. He spoke of his work, informing me of everything. He behaved as if I wished, but always forgot to tell me. Come on! Is Bebo. - Hello. - Why do not you go home? - I wanted to speak before you. - Well, tell me. He particularly wanted to tell you I'm going to live in San Donato. - Where? - A San Donato, near Florence. Do not you be expecting a girl? But what do you say? They do not know any girl. Some colleagues have found a truck and we will create a transport cooperative. _ Carlino promised to take up Colle there look for how to get to Florence, then to San Donato. - Are you listening? - I'm not deaf! Now I see your father without fail. Where, in Colle? What you have to see my father? - To speak of us, right? - All of us? - What in heaven's name why? - How that saint of what? I do not want to do things in secret! At home I have said and we need to tell your family. You're crazy! My family does not care or should care. I gotta go, I can not waste time now! Go, go! What are you waiting? Okay, I'm going. Bye. Bye Hey we might not see in a long time. _ Do we kiss? - Bye. - Bye. - Good evening, women. - Hi, Dad. - Tell me, dear, will you be happy? - Why? Me too, I'm glad my daughter has been promised. - What did your daughter? - Play. - How? Did not I tell you? - What? He has promised to Bebo. Yes .. He has asked permission and I have given, because it is honest, and because it is partisan. With these ideas misfortune to my Sante and now her. - But what do you say? - That if you want to go with a partisan, he goes. - Shut up. But here at home do not want it. Understand? Take him to the fields, wherever you want, but not here. Not here! Play! Again did something without consulting me. He gave me so angry that I decided not to punish me for insider, and not told anyone that she was engaged. Mara! Mara! - What do you want? - Come home, has Bebo. - Bebo has come, hear? - I heard you. Yes, it is a rebellious girl, but change. For now, you are safer in Volterra here. Do one thing: tomorrow take my bike and go to Colle and then to Volterra on the bus. The bike I leave her party headquarters. Since I have to go to Volterra, Mara could take me, to introduce you to my family. Bebo Mara says to go there yourself. No, tell him to come, there are important things to talk about, and make haste. _ Not coming. Heavy! Go! - Dad told you to go faster. - Let me dance. Go. Too bad for you. I've been warned. Can I drink? Mara, I'm sorry, but I also like dancing. Give me your shoes! - I'm going to eat! - No, but the spoil. Careful not to step on me. Here is Mara. She can tell what happened to you, but not his mother. Good night. Surely not expect me. - I thought you were dead. - Why do not you write? It's just that I had a lot of work. As compensation, I have saved some money. It is noted, you have become a new suit. There is the usual one. Yes, a bit worn. I buy a new one in Volterra. I saved almost 20,000 lire. Then you could have brought me a gift. It occurred to me, but I had come unexpectedly. - Suddenly? Why? - Something has happened. The business was going very well, But Sgt Carabinieri always wanted to annoy us, always. Even wanted to confiscate the truck. - Why take with you? - Why? Because at heart he was a fascist. He said it was fascist, but the office had hung the picture of the king, Mussolini's friend. You understand what fascism was the sergeant Cecor? - Sergeant "blind"? - No. I did not say "blind" but Cecor. Why are you laughing? A sergeant blind could not catch the thieves. - I do not catch anybody else. - Why? Yesterday we had something in the church. I do not know what the celebration... I think it was the Ascension. I was with Ivan, Umberto, my co-workers. They were with two girls who wanted to attend mass. When we reached the church the priest would not let us in, because he said he wore shorts. How? I was dressed like this. Umberto Ivan and wore shorts and a red neckerchief. But the priest was just an excuse. He would not let us in because we were partisans. And Umberto told him loud and clear: "Before the fascists came with their flag and let them pass, they let us go with the red scarf. But nothing, not yield. Then came the sergeant Cecor and gave him the right to cure. I explained our reasons, but not convinced. Then we put it against the wall, because we were not willing to endure abuse, and so what happened happened. - But what happened? As I understand nothing accounts. I just do not pay attention. The sergeant, viewed against the wall, drew his pistol and started shooting, gave Umberto and killed him. But we have avenged. First we kill the sergeant and later to his son. I killed him. Out of nowhere, and seeing his dead father, began to call for help. _ When he saw it pointed out, started running like crazy. I ran after him, but sought refuge in a house, just as I was to reach it, then followed him down the stairs. When he got up he had to stop and then fired. _ Outside the church, imagine the scene... A crowd had gathered. And that poor girl, fiance Umberto screaming, crying, screaming that was not true. We had to take her away by force. - Are you happy to go to Volterra with him? - What? - Yes, going to meet his family. - What family? If your father does not care if you go... Bebo Mara you make the bed in the kitchen. Why? You can sleep in my room, I'm going home for Liliana. No, better not to know that Bebo has stayed here today. Dear, you're going only to Colle. And also Volterra. Why? Because you should not do and undo without asking my opinion! - That we had not decided? - What we decided? You and my father to decide, but I'm not your maid so go to Volterra, nothing. - I wanted to meet my family. Great! Not even your mother has opposed. She was not goals! If I leave, will be very happy! And if I never much more! Tomorrow wanted to buy a gift Colle - Do you buy shoes? - Sure. I have money saved, you can ask me anything you want. - A pair of high heels? - Yes Looking for company? Miss, come here... Come see what we have, we look at the dishes. Sure you have... Miss, come see, I will make a special price half price, today I'm going to ruin. Madam, come and buy something, look, dishes ... Why did not you wait for me before the game? What are you doing here? - I wanted to see the market. - I told you there movieras. I usually do what I want. If you feel bad, you're ready. Do as I say, if I obey, we will have problems. - Just kidding, you're taking everything seriously. - I never joke. Come on. - To buy shoes? - Yes - There, there is! - No. The market does not, go to a store, the better. - Want something? - Yes, I-heeled shoes for her. How do you want Miss?

Tarry. Come. Come, sit. We will go on the road to Volterra, to see if someone takes us .. Yes, better not let you see much, you're right. - ?Ha dormido? - No, I left the ants. I climbed up the legs. "Has any car? Have you seen? We could have stayed in Colle. - Why have you brought him? - I have good reason. It is the Liberation Committee, can help with San Donato. Tell the truth, not apparent, but you're afraid, eh? The bus! - Memmo, what we do, we go up? - Yes, or we'll spend the night here. Bebo, thank goodness you're here! The cure is within Solfi. Up, up, Bebo, quick! Good! Now pay. Murderer! - Bebo, have you seen the Solfi cure? - 90 lire. Shut up, lady. It's there. My daughter was also killed a son! All you some knowledge, was a boy of 19 years. - His name Valdini Silvano. Bastard! Go! - Go away, I'll kill you! - Calm down, ma'am. - Do not assemble a mess on the bus. - Let me go! It is true what you say is true. - Let me go! - Madam, sit down. What do you know? It was my grandson! Criminal! Criminal! - Are you a relative of yours? - No. Please calm down, I will stop the bus to come down. Bebo, you must avenge my grandson. We must do justice. But now calm. Come, come, calm yourself. What did that priest? Sided with the fascists and the Germans. In Volterra have not forgotten. He was 19 years old, a boy like you. Madam we have all lost someone. My fiancee's brother was in a partisan to me. - They killed the Germans. - Get up. - Sit down, lady, come, come. - Sit over there. Sit. We also have killed a brother, right? Bebo, do not get into trouble. This sent the British and Americans. - Do not give them reason to intervene. - Yes Are you getting off someone in San Lazzaro? Excuse me. - Bye. - Bye, Memmo. - Hello. - Here comes the cure Solfi. - Go up. It's there. - Also Bebo. Come on, go up. It's over there. To download...! - The cure Solfi going on the bus. - And Bebo too. - He's back! - Guido, runs, is the cure fascist! Everyone knows you and all hate you, bastard. Everyone hates you, murderer.

Baja! Make it go away! Go! - Kill him, Bebo! - Shut up! Go home! Bebo is responsible for this, calm down. Go home. - No! - No! Mom! - No, the "carabinieri" No! - We will do justice! It is a scoundrel! What? There you have it! Colle, first, Bebo had been kind, just as I wanted, so willingly went with him to his home. But once there I felt like leaving. Everything was dirty and messy. The mother and sister were not sympathetic to me, and so we started arguing again. I'm used to sleeping alone. In my house, always I gave you my room. But I can not sleep with two women. Why not? Are your mother and sister. Yes, but only two women. O sleeps alone, here on the kitchen or go to a pension. - Bebo? - Who is? Excuse me, miss, I'm friends with Bebo, Lidori. Already. What has scared me! I must speak with Bebo urgently. Are you there? Yes, but sleeps. Better than what I awake to do so the Carabinieri. - Bebo? - What? What happened? We seek the Carabinieri. - Why is the cure? - No, for the murder of Sgt. - This is Mara, my fiancee. - I thought so. Before your mother did not want to say but the thing is serious. - They must not find you here. - Where will wear me? Bava believes that the best place is that factory bombed where you hid it before making partisans. The hope here and if they try to climb... No, it's up to the game, coming with me. Bebo, I want to go home. Give me money for the trip. It's Sunday and no bus until Tuesday, you stay. How? Then I go with you! You're crazy, that one is no place for women. - Well, I like! - Yes, not a bad idea. The Carabinieri should not find it here. See? Come, I must dress. Hurry. We waited below. If you are the Carabinieri, say you have not seen Bebo. Come on. - Bye, Mom. Bye. - Bye, Bebo. Venga, se?orita. This is quite safe. There is also a place to sleep. I will find out what happens and I'll be back. Until then, miss. - Stop at my house. - Sure. Bye. And quit you, eh? - Bye. - Bye. Where does this music? Today is holiday. There must be a tavern back there. Maybe they're dancing. What a pity we can not go. And Lidori not coming. I hope that has not happened. Bebo me the truth, Do you think you have to hide for long? Then, peers try to fix things. _ But how long ' A month? Two? Do not know. Bebo, what need was to get into this mess? What do you care about the sergeant? He fired first. and killed a classmate of mine. What could I do? What next? Why did you kill your child? You know? In those moments... one does not reflect. But you, Mara, I did not expect. Memmo reproached me what I can understand, because he says that's one of us, but not true. Never has been! He has not even seen the misery! But you! Your father gave chase! And your brother was killed by the fascists! Would have to kill all the fascists! All that would kill them all! The fault was that Sgt. He asked for it. The son was not to blame, you're right. But when Umberto died, did not think of anything else. We all screamed like crazy. I can not explain, but sometimes you see in situations. in which one can act in a way. It was a disgrace. It's dark. How long we'll be here? You've fallen asleep. The truth is no. Thinking of you. - I love you, Mara. - I love you too, Bebo. Bebo strove to show insurance, but now he knew that he was not, that never had been, at all. I was not angry, and I was born a desire to comfort him, protect him. Finally you woke up. - Why? Is it too late? - No. - Did not become Lidori? - No, no one has come. Do we make a deal? - What treatment? - They always tell us everything. - Yes or no? - Yes Now kiss me. Upon awakening, you need a kiss. Where you going? A wash. - Bebo, you do not love me. - Not true. If not for the bus, you'd come alone, I would have brought. _ Whenever you shun me. Is it true that if you shun me? No. Oh, my love! Yes, I know how it is, is here today and not tomorrow. Have you seen? Not have realized that we are here. Sure, there are Carabinieri. It is better to leave here. Sorry. No, Bebo, no! Yes, sorry, Mara. Come here beside me. There's the bar. Takes money, you go. Buy a package of "Nazionale". - Can I buy a soda? - Yes Go, quickly. A or "Nazionale". Thank you. - And... - Come on. What? Nothing. Who is it? It's me, Mara. He has been my cousin. - Arnold, she is Mara. - Good evening. Why not come Lidori? He was arrested the Carabinieri to leave. Why did you walk around? They can see you. - Went to buy cigarettes. - Here. - Thanks. - I gotta go. - Bye. - Bye. - Do we agree? - Yes - Bye, Bebo. - Bye. - Bebo? - Yes? Give me the gun. - Why? - Give it to me. What do you do? Nothing. Now, promise me you will not do nonsense. Okay, promise. What did your cousin? He did not say anything. What did I say? I have seen him speak. Yes We discussed what happened. Tell the truth. They want me to go for a while. Come to pick up car. - Where do you wear? - Do not know. Maybe send me abroad. - An alien? - Yes, but only for a while. Do not think about that now. We go to sleep. When will they come to fetch you? - Tomorrow, early. - Tomorrow? Then this is the last night we spent together. Bebo, hold me! Hold me tight! I want to be so until they come. Why did not you hug me? What's wrong? - Nothing. - Are you angry with me? No. So why do not you hug me? Can you no longer want to hug? But what do you say? I'm too eager, too, Mara. We separated for a long time, so you better... You book your commitment, you are no longer obliged to consider you my bride. So I no longer want. Do not you understand that... I say this because I love you? I make you happy, but if not possible, is better... But I love you, Bebo, want to be with you always. And if you go abroad, I too. Will not let you, my love, Do not talk like that. I love you. I love you. My love, how miserable we are. Hold me, hold me tight. I do not care that we are not married. Bebo! Bebo! It is daytime. Bebo, come on. Get in, quick. No, you stay. Arnaldo! Take care of the girl. - Bebo! Wait! Send me news. - Quiet, returns home. Bye. Bye. "Mara? Why do not you go have fun too? - I like it. - Mara, listen to your mother. Forget that Bebo, a guy like that just brings problems. What do you mean? Let your Bebo have done something big, if you seek the Carabinieri. But if you already have company. Mara, you are also here. I thought you were gone. Well I'm back. Mara, where you going? Come on, Mara. Leave her alone, do not you see you're sad? - He wants to talk, yes or no? - Ask and I respond. He went to Volterra this Bebo. - Do not deny it, because they saw it. - Who has denied? But the "carabinieri" not found at home of Bebo. Sure, he had come. - Where'd he go? - The ride. Hey, lady, Bebo has escaped, but catch him. Be assured that, and the imprisonment not save anyone. Understand? - Leave them there. - Can I go? Go, but remember to be at our disposal. Come on, Dad. They believe that we have taken up arms, these naive but do not know that the good are hidden. Let it be the British and Americans, then we'll see who's boss. - Dad? How long is life? One is in jail for life. Why? The sergeant has said he will capture Bebo and to cast them perpetual. - Did you say that? Yes, we'll see if they catch him, will now be laughing at them. Where is he? - In Russia, where else? - In Russia? Yes, but quiet, there is safe. He sent the Communists. She played in front of their noses. Then you have to stay in Russia for good, because if you stop back to Italy. No, I told you. This will change things, yes. Dad? Tell me, daughter. Are you sure that will be out soon, he'll be back? Swear, Swear by Sante. Yes, yes. The game will do that. Come on. Those words: perpetual, Russia... My heart sank. could not continue living in Monte Guidi, because I was always annoyed that people feel sorry for me, so I decided to go to work in the city. I helped a girl from my town, Ines, I stayed with her sister, and I sought employment with her ironing. If you get on ceremony, farewell. I am also engaged. - But my boyfriend is away. - All the better, right? Mine is in Monte Guidi. and can occur at any time. But here I have left at least three. If one works all day, is entitled to have fun, right? You know what I would do in your place? Enjoy life. These are our best years, can not you see? Then, if the boyfriend comes back, kisses and hugs. And if not, death of a pope is elected to another. Is it possible? Sorry, Ines. Pass. This brother of mine is a pig. Find any excuse to see me in combination. Do you understand my theory? Qu?mense, esc?ldense stomach. In the film put "Waterloo Bridge" with Robert Taylor. It's very pretty. My sister told me.

Yesterday I received a letter from this girl one from which I spoke, remember? But if I write so often, what he says? That would like me ... If not tell me, excuse me, I would not be indiscreet. No, never mind. Always writes the same, that is sorry and he's sorry. And you replied? Yes, to tell you not to believe in his good intentions. Umberto II goes to the balcony, cheered by the crowd. flags wave with the emblem of Savoy... Please hurry, I would show him the site where I work. - Is it far? - No, next door. Why here or there?

Naturally I have changed names. Before writing poems but I quit. Why? - They were very bad. - You sure? Yes Listen, this is one of the last. "Mom, you know why I'm away. To work, Mom. and not see a woman that would be fatal to my life." I did well to stop. It's not so bad. - Do you like? - Yes Some time ago I read a book that taught me many things. If you want, we will lend. It is entitled "And the stars are watching. I like the title. I work here. - Must be hard work. - Yes I really like my job... but I prefer being in the city than my hometown. If I may, I will look for a better job. Thanks, very kind, but I can not do anything. Relax, I'm sure you will learn. If the sergeant had not killed that partisan, Bebo not have shot him. Soon there will be an amnesty, I'm sure. Everyone tells me there will be an amnesty. but I'm here alone and without knowing where it is. I knew you had a problem. I was too serious for your age. I was about to ask, but ... then I had no courage. Do you see that I am more fortunate than you? The world has changed, everything has changed. The people have been mobilized. Italy has been a second Risorgimento, true Risorgimento. We say it out loud, on behalf of Matteotti, Turati... The future of Italy is called the Savoy. Italian ... Keep walking, do not want to give bad example. He is not like me is a poet. The only thing I liked about my girlfriend was his physique. There was no affinity between us. - Contigo is different, Mara. - Why? What am I? I think... the appearance is the mirror of the soul. There are two things that really can not be separated, Do you understand? My girlfriend is pretty, but there is something vulgar. While your beauty, Mara, is almost spiritual. Yes, I mean your face, the look on your face, your gracious gesture. I always like looking at you. Mara, I think you're my soul mate. Stefano, we should not go together anymore. - Why? - As you just said. - But if there's nothing wrong. - I think so. I'm engaged. I know it. At least we can comfort each other. No, Stefano, we should not. Agreed. I understand. I respect you too. I regret not having known before. When? When you were free. Mara... if your heart was free, Do you think you might feel love for me? No, not that. Look into my eyes. Yes No! Comrades, partisans who died to wash their sacrifice shame and ignominy in which we had fallen, have allowed us to us, the Italian people... - Hi, Mara. - Hello. - You know what? - No, still nothing. How? After a year? It proved difficult to deliver news. It is better to be prudent. But where is it? If only you knew. - It's in Yugoslavia. - In Yugoslavia? If you declare a republic, do you think that Bebo may return? Clear. Viva Italia! Viva Italia! Votad by the republic, vote for Garibaldi. Italy developments, for peace, freedom... Miss Mara, if you want to go to Colle hurry, I leave. Citizens, remember: the monarchy fell to Italy in disgrace. Votad by the republic, vote for Garibaldi. Why not send news? Who knows? I only know that in Volterra are instructing trial. Do you think will win the election? Sure, sure. In the administrative elections already seen what he thought the people. - Hey, Mom, how are you? - I'm better. - Do you have a fever? - No, I do not. - Does it hurt the wound? - No, it's nothing. My mother better, and in the days I spent with her I was surprised thinking more about Stefano than Bebo. _ His long speeches scared me, but also security and confidence inspired me, something I had never experienced. Bebo did not forget, but Stefano was the only person who gave me some serenity. I wondered if he was not entitled to also have a life. - Can I give you the welcome? - How are you? I was afraid you'd stay in Monte Guidi. - How's your mother? - Fine. Are you glad you have returned? Mr Santini, a parade for the Republic! It is certain that we have won! Viva la Republica! Mara, I have not done anything but think of you. I tried to fight against my feelings, but... I could not. I have also tried to forget, but I did not succeed. What gives me joy to say that. No! Mara, I'm sure that I want. Mara. Dad? What? Is it wrong mom? Hello. - No, we are all well, is that ... - What? Mara, you come with me. So it is not certain he is okay. No, no, mom is right. - Come to where we can talk. - Where? - The coffee. Lidori ahead. - Why? It is because of Bebo. He's been arrested. To him and he killed the sergeant. They are in prison in Volterra. In Volterra? Yes, come. - I stopped at the border. - Was he trying to return to Italy? No, he was expelled along with another hundred colleagues. - Hi, Mara. - Hello. Sit. What about amnesty? What a chore. They drove the fascists and those who got rich screwing the people. _ It was necessary to calm things down. The mood of the fascists. Bebo is a partisan, and amnesty was not made for them. I can accompany you. How? If we just for you. Come on, you can not do that. I do not care. Mara, you must have courage awaits. Will be extremely disappointed. Come, child, you are very brave. The permit is valid only for today. We will arrive soon, there is a bus. The permit is only for one person: Mara Castellucci. There can be requested for two people. The paper says it quite clear, only for her. Mara, be brave, you must enter alone. No, one does not go. At least I let it to accompany her. No matter. Shall we? Sit there. The visit will last quarter of an hour. Can not approach. Hello, Bebo. Hi, Mara. - Glad to see you again. - Me too. You have not changed anything. You look great. You've even gained weight. Tell me how you find me. Outside are Lidori and my father. They have not allowed in. because they had no permit. Yesterday they were with the lawyer. He should not worry. Maybe not even have trial and though it has... You are calm, right? How are you? Well, fine. Now I work in the city, in a press. Estuviete Where all this time? Why not send me news? Why did you stay silent? I wanted so much to see, but not, not here. Basta! Enough! What kind of man you aiting for, well? You should cum down. Understand? Outside you have friends who do not leave. You are in the hands of a good lawyer. You'll see how everything works out. I'm sure, Bebo, absolutely certain. You're right, Mara. I'm sorry. I'm desperate, but quite the opposite. But I was impressed to see you again. Do not expect it. During these months, but did not give signs of life, always thought of you. Bebo, do you need something? No, no, thanks. My sister sent me a package. If you need anything, let me know. Sure. Mara, I... I wanted to ask you something. Yes? Do you feel for me as before? That is, in my absence... Have you changed your mind? You know what I mean? Why should he change his mind? You know? When you are alone, far, imagine many things. While I was there, gave my head around a lot. Now at least I've seen. I feel better. I'm not afraid. Clear. Do not worry. Will you return to visit again? Clear. As soon as I give permission. Me ha hecho bien volver a verte, Mara. No, I'm not afraid. You know, Mara? Since you know, I keep thinking about my future. Not that he had not thought of before, but things before he took me as they were. Now think about what I do in life, Understand? Now we are two. - Mara, what's wrong? Are you crying? - Nothing. No. - Yes I cry, what happens? - No. - What is it? - Nothing. - Have you received bad news? - No! Mara, do not do that, please. If... if you think something, you tell me. There should be no secrets between us. If something happens, I'm here to help, to understand you, as ever. Marry me, Stefano! Marry me now! had wanted something to happen irreparable, but now, again I felt insecure. View Bebo alone and self-confidence made me feel so close to him as he had never been. I sincerely hope that the trial come out well, Bebo and no longer needed me. - The last door on the left. - Thanks. Dad? - Do not leave me alone, please. - Of course, where would you go? - Hola, Lidori. - Hello, how are you? What do you think? Here we are. - And Mara? - There it is. Hi Mara. Has been the sister of Bebo. Elvira. Hello. The mother would not have brought, is a bad heart. Hi, Mara. Do not you remember me? I am the cousin of Bebo. That was to fetch the factory bombed. - We did not see each other again. - No. - What are you doing? Do you work? - No, study. How are you? Are you quiet? - All right, everything will be fine. - Thanks. Who is this woman? The widow of sergeant, person by the prosecution. That's bad, right? Of course, not good. It is logical to do so. Put yourself in his place, he killed the husband and son. Advocate. Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello, how are you? - Hello. - Hello. The court Mara! Mara! You can talk with Bebo. I got the permit, see. - Hi, Mara. - Hello, Bebo. Do not understand anything. He spoke very low. - And Lidori? - What? What's that, you think? You shall not serve more than 3 years, because it was in self defense. - I do not have much hope. - Lawyers are very good. Your friends took up a collection to pay them. Better than ever have been my friends. Why say that? They made me do what I did. It is fair to say that. None opened my eyes when there was still time. If I had delivered before the amnesty, now would be out. But everyone told me not to. Remember what I said Memmo in the "trattoria" Colle? He had studies, should understand these things. Why not tell me that escape was worse, it would not do anything? And Lidori that night I came to wake, said I should run away, hide. I obeyed, "and what helped me escape? - But Lidori appreciate you very much. - No. And tell him not to come to me. I do not want to see anyone. Mara, you're the only person happy to see me. I just feel guilty for you, and what torments me most is the pain I've caused. - Do not say that, dear Bebo. - The court! - Bye, Bebo. - Goodbye, Mara. - Bye. Goodbye, Bebo. - Bye. Bebo says these things because he is in jail. So who's to blame? From the war, of fascism. The real causes are forgotten, and remembered only the consequences. Will the judges understand that Bebo is not violent? You do not trust it too much. It would take a different court, to take account of its merits as a partisan, and not only their guilt. The trouble is that the act applies as if nothing had happened. Swear to tell the truth, only truth and nothing but the truth. _ - Say "I swear". - I swear. Sit. Miss., wanted to testify. What does that mean? - How? - What do you mean? Talk. Well? - Higher! - I... Easy, miss. - I meant ... - What did he mean? Well... Bebo... Miss, was in San Donato when the defendant killed Cecor sergeant's son? In San Donato, no. President, it's clear that the witness can't say anything that has to do with the cause. It is not correct. The integrity and character of our client is very interested. It will be asked to clarify what his fiancee. Our witnesses are as reliable as the prosecution's. Advocate, relax. Miss, are you engaged to the defendant Capellini? Yes Why has requested that we listen? I wanted ... help. Help. I understand. What did he mean exactly? - Many things. - Talk. - I was on the bus... - On the bus? When quisi... - When... - Easy, miss. When they wanted... - When they wanted to lynch the cure. - When you cure? President, this episode is known to spare, I think it is useless to insist on it. Miss, dry your tears, do not cry. He has always said the Carabinieri who knew nothing. Do you have anything new to say? No, do not know. Note: "Miss confirms the statement made. Please retire. - Have I done? - Yes - But I, well... - Dismissed. Objection! The girl said nothing and ordered him to retire. He admits he does not know what to say. President, witnesses happen here, nobody has said the accused shot the son of Sgt. He is a hero of the Resistance! Sergeant was also a partisan hat! Silent or clear the room! Mara. I have something to say. When placed against Bebo mom always defended him. But we must understand their point of view. So? A parent only wants the good of his daughter. We'll wait for the sentence but if it goes wrong... If something goes wrong, what? You've already sacrificed enough for him, daughter. Okay, I understand, Dad. Stefano. Hello. What are you doing here? I saw Mario and I said you had gone to the movies. I waited until nine, didn't come to see that... I had to go to Volterra with my father. What Volterra? Why? The trial of Bebo. Could have told me. You're right, sorry. I had no value. - Was it necessary to have it? - Yes Stefano, this is the last time we meet. Mara, why? Have you told us? - Why? - I could not do. - When will you return to him? - Does not matter. Stefano... never forget the times we spent together. Maybe... may be the only happy hours that I will have had in life. But now we must part, one must follow his path. Stefano, I'm the girl of Bebo. I will never have good luck. You know you break my heart to say so. I know. I will remember all my life, Mara. I'll never forget. Please. Excuse me. Do you think that the accused wanted to protect him from the crowd... or act against you? Everyone wanted to attack me. The defendant gave me is true, the Carabinieri, and on the bus tried to calm the woman. Do you believe or not the witness without the presence of Arthur Capellini his return to the parish would've ended in tragedy? Answer. Probably. Have you heard? The priest said that Bebo Solfi wanted to protect. It's important. The lawyer said that alot of time deliberating is a good sign. - Or maybe worse. - No. Do not get upset if the sentence is harsh, because there will be another amnesty, next year, after the elections. I'm prepared for anything. Do not ever leave, no matter what happens. I know, Mara, I believe. Just believe in you. Bebo... not true that nobody wants. It is true that your friends would best of him. The problem is this court, who sees evil and nothing happened. If you say so. But nobody helped me like you, Mara, and just for you I want to move forward, if not, I would have committed suicide. - Quiet, please! I just want you to know that I owe everything. I've had very bad luck, but fortune to meet you. but for you I was just a disgrace. Calla. The court All will be well, do not worry. Bye. On behalf of the Italian people... Mara! What a surprise seeing you again after so long. - Where you going? - A visit to Bebo. - You see very often? - Every two weeks. Listen, Mara... you really are brave. Bebo is the one who carries within seven years. But it collapses, is done with resignation. At first it was more difficult, but now we think in the future. You wait another seven years? Also pass. I will be 34 years and he, 37, We can still have kids. Many people get married even older. And what do you do? I work here. Are you married? Yes - How you were promised? - No. With another. - Goodbye, Mara. - Bye, Stefano. Soon I will see Bebo. I know he expected minutes as I spent together. When he was sentenced to 14 years feared not being able to bear it, but it became very easy. Subtitles from Retro-Rhythm
