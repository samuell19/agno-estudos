THE LAST WEYNFELDT THE LAST WEYNFELDT Another one, please. Yes. Yes, sir, right away. A gin fizz. Thanks. I will have your olive if you don't want it. Lorena. Adrian Weynfeldt. How much is a gin fizz? Eighteen. So, I have enough for three. If you allow me, I will invite you. I allow it, yes. A gin fizz for madam. For sir, a martini. You don't have to drink it, I just want the olive. I won't be able to bear another winter like this. I am giving myself one year maximum before leaving here. -I dream of going to Brazil. -I see. I want to go on a yacht at least once in my life. Do you have a yacht? -No, I don't. -It would be awesome. I can see myself everywhere, the ocean around me. As soon as the weather worsens, we go where it is gorgeous. I think yachts are overhyped. There is little room and you can't leave if you can't bear the others. That is a fricking pain! You are right, I did not see things that way. Where are you going? How would I know, you have not said where you live. I live here. Here? Wow! In a bank? Please. Wow! Tell me, what do you work in? Maybe, you don't even work? I work at Murphy's, I am an expert in Swiss art. Is that why there are so many paintings? It is rather the opposite. If I do this job, it is because of all these paintings. Uh-huh. What do you do exactly when you are expert in Swiss art? You carry out an expertise, you organize auctions, you edit catalogues, etc. It sounds deadly boring. But it is not. What do you want to drink? I don't know, whatever you are having. Wait for me, I will be back. Are we not fucking? Tomorrow, if you still want to. Don't come, stay where you are. Don't do it, no. There are only a dozen meters. You may survive. But can you imagine in what state? Stop! You don't care if I jump or not. It would not be pretty, that is what bothers you. The formalities with the police, all that bothers you. You don't care about me, right? Give me a reason not to jump. One reason. Shit. Stop crying. You are a pain. Nothing happened. Come on. Do you ever not want to get up in the morning because suddenly nothing makes any sense? Yes, I know that. And? What do you do then? I go to a bar and I order a Martini. Yeah, right. If I had the same life as you, clearly I would not throw myself out of the window. Just in case. In case what? Just in case, you never know. Oh, look at that! I won't give you one, sorry I forgot them. -Sarah. -Adrian, it has been a long time. It is always the same. You spend your time criticizing. Listen to me, Stephane, please. Read her script at least, we will talk about it after. Hemingway's famous suitcase has become... filled with stories of short-named sailors. -Thanks. -Bullshit. Honestly, it makes no sense. -You should write... -Give him some time, -it is just a draft. -Hey, Adrian, Yes. Are you still interested in having a gym fitted? I have everything needed to start working. Yes, but I don't know, Gaspard. I am not sure it matches the style of my apartment. Excuse me. Hello? How are you? I am not going to make a 2-hour film on an idea at the cinema. Right. Listen, for now, no one wants your script. Please. Like usual, I will get it. Listen, Adrian. Yes. I have something to tell you. Yes, I am listening. Yes, but maybe not here. Yes, whenever you want, Rolf. I will ask Veronique to make an appointment for you. Thanks, Adrian. Would you like another? Yes, please. The young woman from the other night never came back. Oh, thanks. OK. Another one. Superb. Turn towards the branch. That is it. Now, in front of the sink. Go before the sink. Yes, just in front. Wash your hands. There is no water. I don't know, dry your hands. Very well. -That is it. -OK. That is good. Yes, I have done almost everything, including TV ads. But the craziest thing was a calendar for farming equipment. I had to pose in boots with a chainsaw in my hand, surrounded by little gorillas who did... Hurry up, please. It didn't take too long? You bitch! No need to come to work tomorrow. London called. They wanted to know if there would be interesting things at the sale for their collectors. I told them their collectors were also ours in the first place, and that we had kept them informed a long time ago. I am not at all happy with these prints. In ten days, the catalogue must go to the printers and we still don't have a conversation piece for this sale. A what? A conversation piece, an intimist painting that the press can get their teeth into. Is that what people say nowadays? But you are right. This auction is missing something to get it going. Mr. Weynfeldt. Good afternoon, how are you? Very well, thank you. You? Mr. Baier is expecting you in the living room. Let me take this. How long has it been since we saw each other, Adrian? Four years, five? At my mother's funeral. -Five years, yes. -You have not changed at all. You haven't either. Oh, I have! I hope to get to 80. Many things change at that age. You only do short-term projects. My doctor says I have no more than five years left. But I think I have ten. I am going to live by Lake Como. This city no longer needs me, I have done my time. The world has changed so much, Adrian. Only you and I remain from our generation, we are dinosaurs. You must wonder why I asked you to come today? In your opinion, at your sale, what price would my Vallotton get? It would sell well, for sure. I often asked what she looks like face-on. But unfortunately, she has never turned around. What do you think? You know what I think of this painting. It is remarkable. In Swiss francs, please. Between 700,000 and 1 million. That is what you said some time ago. But since then, "On a walk" sold for 2.3 million, a painting that is twice as small than this. That is the dynamic of a sale. -Two bidders pushing each other -Something you can control. Invite Vallotton's collectors, and let them loose on each other. It is a driving force for your auctions, right? But I won't let it go for less than a million. Let's say between 1 million and 1.5 million, does it seem doable? Between 1 million and 1.3 million. You can take it. Lorena! Where had you gone? I must have left 20,000 messages on your voicemail. Why don't you answer? Come on, stop now. Calm down. You told me it was over between us. I don't care, you can sleep with who you want but not in my bed. I thought you were working all weekend. I didn't know you would turn up. The bathrobe is also mine. Hurry up. I will send someone for the rest. I returned the flat, Theo. You can start getting rid of the furniture. The bed first. -White wine? -You wouldn't have a beer? Do we have beer for Mr. Strasser? Yes, there is some. Who is this flamboyant redhead in the photo? It is Daphne. Your girlfriend? A very long time ago. Please, sit down. You know what is terrible, is when time passes and you stagnate, like me. You are not stagnating, Rolf. Stop being fricking polite, you pain in the ass! Obviously I am stagnating. For the last 12 years I have painted the same shit. Except at the time, I still hoped to succeed. I know that feeling. You start your day then you feel like you know exactly how it will end. It is not just depressing. Yes, I know. Thanks, Mrs. Hauser. With me, it is not just a feeling. With me, it has become a certainty. I need a new start, Adrian. A new momentum. I need to leave. Not to Italy as before, I recognize that was a mistake. I don't simply want to escape this town. I want to go somewhere. Do you have an idea in mind? Somewhere you would like to go? Hiva Oa, in Polynesia. The largest Marquesas island. In fact, Gauguin is buried there. And Gauguin said one day: "To make a fresh start, one must first "return to the origins of the world, "return to humanity's childhood." That is where I will find, my dear Adrian, the new momentum I need. If I can help you in whatever way I can to realize your dream... Life on the island is not cheap. There are living costs, the workshop, insurance and so on. It goes fast. I need 50,000. Of course, if you agree to give me a hand, I will pay you interest, obviously. Of course I will pay you back when I return. At last I will have the success I deserve and my work will be appreciated at its true worth. That seems very reasonable. I knew you would understand me, Adrian. Thanks. You are the first on whom it looks good. Oh yes? Thanks. -Sir will show you. -Please, come. Would you like to try this one? No, thanks. Do you need help? Yes, could you help me with the zip. Of course. Thanks. I don't know. I don't really like the cut. I will try the others. There. Choosing is not easy, is it? Here is what we are going to do. Put them aside for me until tomorrow and I will come and try them on with my friend, is that OK? Yes, no problem. Thanks. Forgive me. Allow me to introduce myself, Melanie Gabel, owner of the store. May I ask you to show me your bag, please? What my teacher said was probably true: "Strasser, you are an excellent artisan, but not an artist, sadly." Yes, that is why I became an artist painter. As one says, an escape artist or a striptease artist. Excuse me, sir, someone on the line for you. Adrian Weynfeldt. Yes, sorry, darling. Your secretary agreed to give me that number. Can you come as soon as possible to the Spotlight store? Of course, was is it? To resolve a very unfortunate misunderstanding. I will be there in 10 minutes. Yes, see you soon. Oh Rolf, I'm sorry but it was an urgent call. Maybe we could continue this conversation another time? Felix Vallotton, it will be part of the sale. I am keeping it at mine in the meantime. You mean this Vallotton, that I see here, will be part of your sale? Yes. How much do you think for such a painting? I am not sure yet but I think we will start at one million. -Oh yes! -Rolf, I am sorry, -but I must... -No problem. -I am leaving. -Let me walk you out. Oh here you are, darling. Thanks, it is really nice of you to come. Mr. Weynfeldt, Melanie Gabel. Pleased to meet you. What happened? It is simple, I tried some dresses on and then, I wanted to show you. To do so, I put one in my bag. When I came out, it slipped my mind. Oh but wait. You need to see if you like the dresses. Give me the black one. Sit down. So? What do you think? Charming. It looks like this dress is made for you. Do you think? Could I see the others? You didn't have to buy them all. I will remember this. What will I do with all these dresses? Wear them, they suit you. You saved me once more. Thanks. Oh! -You are welcome. -Are you not curious? About what? To know why I stole a dress. It is none of my business. It costs you loads of cash and it is not your business? Why did you save me again? Because you asked, that is all. You always do everything people ask? If it is in my power, yes. If you knew what I had to tell that battleax of a secretary to get your personal number. You really need a mobile phone. Yes, that is what Veronique says. Veronique? That battleax of a secretary. What are you doing? Sorry. A gentleman stands to the left of a lady unless the sidewalk is narrow, he must be on the side of traffic. I cannot help myself, it is in my blood. I was brought up that way. You protect ladies from the threat of traffic at your life's peril? How touching. Can I invite you to the restaurant? Actually I wasn't planning on being at the store so long this morning. I am in a rush. -Tonight maybe? -Yes. As you wish. Let's say 8 p.m. at the Chateaubriand? Alright. I will take a taxi. If ever I can't make it, how can I reach you? He bought all four. Yes? Lorena, it is me, Pedroni. I am not here, get out. Come on, please. I brought you your palm. Just leave it on the doorstep. It will die of cold if I leave it out. Come on, open up. Are you scared I am going to eat you up? It is nice of me to bring it. I would never have dared entrust your dear palm to the removal guys. Shall we make peace? Have you started looking for an apartment? I will always manage. What about you? Oh my, your new apartment is a real palace. Is that new? Each dress is worth at least 2,000 francs. Did you steal them? No, a friend gave them to me. Bye. A new patron? A guy who works in advertising? No, an artist. Well, a collector. He has disappeared already. Right? He gave you the four dresses, you get it on and bye? No, he is not the type, actually. He has never touched me. Unlike you, he is a gentleman. He saved me and tonight we are meeting for a romantic dinner. Why don't you go now? Quick if he is that generous. You are still as dumb. I won't go obviously so that he continues to be generous. He is the mommy's-boy type with a signet ring. You know how I do it? Do you think we can get more money out of him? As he appears so generous. Does Pedroni have an idea? Yes, Pedroni has an idea. Thanks, I will wait a bit longer. Bring me a sherry, please. Yes, alright. Alright, I am coming. I will call the police. Who is there? It is Rolf. I need to speak to you. Strasser, have you seen the time? Come back tomorrow. Yes, but before I will go to Murphy's, to tell them about your Vallotton. Did anyone call? A young lady. Did the mysterious stranger manage to reach you yesterday? Is she your girlfriend? Adrian, if you don't want me to meddle with your life, get a... I bought one. Done. No! Adrian! I didn't think I would ever see that. Can you set it up? Oh! Before I forget, your friend Rolf Strasser called. He insists on having lunch with you, today. Bacalhau with sausage, what an interesting mix. Let it be clear, Adrian, I am getting the bill. Thanks. Next time, it will be my treat. I will have the salad with marinated tuna. That is all, thanks. I thought you were having the bacalhau. Sir is having the cod. Maybe a little heavy for lunch. Only evening meals should be light, stop it. Bring us two bacalhau. That is what I cannot stand with you. You think: "Oh! The poor guy wants to pay the bill." "Let him have that pleasure, let's pick what is cheapest." Your condescendence pisses me off. Yes, I have had enough. Sorry, I am sorry. You have no idea of how despising and hurtful you can be. Regarding the Marquesas, keep your money. I will find other funding. I don't want to wake up facing the Pacific ocean thinking: "It is thanks to Adrian that I could live in Hiva Oa." Thanks, Adrian. I would have been happy to help you, Rolf. Of course. You love for others to depend on you, because otherwise you would have no friends. That is why you invite us every week to the restaurant. What a generous spirit! Open table for all those famished artists. You cannot imagine how relieved I feel not to have to thank you all the time. I didn't realize this was hard for you. I am sorry. I am sorry! I am sorry! Stop it with your fricking politeness and your condescendence. Let yourself go, argue with me a bit! Come on, live a bit, dammit! I think people think we are a gay couple. You are too dumb. I think you can take the other one back. Thanks. Madam Almeda. Since when have you worked here? It is only three times a week. Soon, Mr. Baier won't need me. He won't take me to Lake Como, that is why I took on another job. Did Mr. Strasser have to leave urgently? Yes. Do you know Rolf Strasser? There was a time when he came to Mr. Baier's every day, to paint. He is a gifted painter. Thanks. One dot. No dot. One dot. No dot. What a phony! No, but what a phony. What if I had not noticed it? Then, no one would have noticed it. You are wrong. I had not noticed because it would have never occurred to me that you would try and pass on a fake to me. Especially you! A friend I have known for so long. I didn't intend to betray your trust. That is what happened. I don't know what took over me. We were lucky that I kept your painting here. Can you imagine what would have happened if I had already booked Murphy's headquarters in London? A scandal would have erupted, I can guarantee it. What an insult! Adrian Weynfeldt got dumped with a fake Vallotton. It is an excellent copy, Adrian. Recognize that at least. Maybe even better than the original. Dinner is ready, gentlemen. On the menu: oxtail soup, which you like so much. At your house, did you show me the original or the fake? There is no original, or fake. Let's say the old one is the new one. It is the same painting, the same sketch but Vallotton's imagination. Stop your blarney, Klaus! You are meddling with art's foundations. Watch out! Just admit it: "Adrian, "I tried to con you, I didn't succeed." I am not meddling with the foundations of painting. I am meddling with the foundations of your profession. That is what you refuse to admit. The difference, you see, dear expert, is not a material one. It is intellectual. Did you enjoy it? A delight, Mrs. Hauser. Many thanks. Coq au vin. Oh! You make a note of my favorite dishes. Your mother always knew how to choose staff. If the difference is not material but only intellectual in your eyes, why did you not keep the copy? Under this patina are my parents' fingerprints. And then mine when I was little, when I was a kid and a teen. My whole life is in that painting. Had you never noticed that my three wives all had a huge backside? If it is that important to you, why don't you keep it? You could sell another one of your paintings. All my paintings have already been sold. But Hodler's "View on Lake Geneva," still hangs in your living room? It is a reproduction, like the Segantini, the Giacomettis and all the rest. So that the walls don't look too empty! Time are hard, Adrian. You have before you a debt-ridden man. I need this money. I don't want to get carried away but the Vallotton could sell at more than 1.5 million. Far more. It is yours. Sorry. I am sorry, do you mind? Adrian Weynfeldt. Hello! So it is true that you can lend her 5,000 francs if she asks for it? Who are you? Is it true or not? Adrian, I... Hello! Who am I speaking to? Yes, it is true. I beg you, otherwise he will go mad. -Hey..., oh! -Hello! So, are you giving it to her? Alright, I will lend you 5,000 francs. Hello! Hello! Please forgive me. There is no reason to. Adrian, let me make a proposition. You keep both and if the sale exceeds 1.6 million, the difference is yours. Mr. Baier does not want any dessert. Call him a taxi, please. But I had prepared a cacciatta. Are you leaving with both or only the fake? My God, Adrian! How close-minded! I will leave you both. I don't walk around with two nudes worth millions. Adrian, please, look at them once more and take the time to think. Let's say, 1.5 million if you want. Anything over 1.5 million, you keep. Adrian! Adrian! Hi. Excuse me, I am sorry. It is very embarrassing. I don't know what to do to get rid of him. Allow me to introduce you, Klaus Baier, Lorena. My humble respects. Think about it, Adrian. I thank you with all my heart, Adrian. So, do you have the money? I need to go to the cashpoint. But where is this man? Do you have the money? I hope you have the money. In future, you had better leave this young woman alone. What a bastard! Thanks. Now, you want to know if I am a whore. No, I don't want to know. If you cared about me, you would certainly like to know. If I cared about you, I would especially not like to know. Why should I think you are a prostitute? Did you not think the guy in the car was a pimp? I am no expert in procurers. He is not a procurer. So, you see. He was a debt collector. That's just great. Don't you want to know why that guy is asking for money? You have no more debts. That is what you think. How much do you owe him? I still owe him 120,000 francs. A trifle. I always have the knack for picking the wrong men. Rest assured. With you, it is rather the opposite. Do you remember when we met? You did not even try to touch me even though I was lying in your bed, why? Why did you bring me back to yours? Because you reminded me of someone. I hope it was a good memory. More or less. And? It is an unremarkable story, I think, not very entertaining. I would still like to hear it. Her name was Daphne. She was a redhead. Like you. She left me for another man. But I did nothing to stop her. When she went to live with that man, she had a car accident, she died on the spot. Oh! I told you, it is not a very entertaining story. What? But it is not your fault. Theoretically, no. Nor in practice. You have nothing to feel guilty about. She left you. She was unfaithful to you and she broke your heart. And you feel guilty? Maybe because of my education, what I know. That is nonsense! Look at me. What was that girl's name? Daphne. It is not my fault if Daphne got killed. Come on, say it. Come on, say it! It is not my fault if Daphne got killed. Wait, we couldn't hear anything. Go for it. It is not my fault if that bitch is dead! Hey! It is fine. She is not here anymore. But there are many things that will never get fixed. That is why we should rather worry about problems we can fix. How are you getting on with that man and the 120,000 francs? Let me know if I can help you. So? Where is my share? Did he believe it? Yes, it seems like it. It is up to you to call him. "In future, you had better leave this young woman alone." Did you see him blush? Oh! Your knight in shining armor. You were right, he really is a mommy's boy. What a pussy! He is not a pussy, he is different, that is all. He has manners, at least. Maybe a bit old-fashioned. Shame for him. Because it is rather the opposite that turns you on. What did I do wrong again? Who had the idea? A dumb idea. I am the baddy in the story. I am taking risks. Do you want to renegotiate your share? Do you pity that poor guy? You find him cute. You are a pain in the ass. Great! We find the ideal sucker and you have to fall for him. -Your savior. -You are really an asshole. What will you do if he asks for an IOU? I am going to eat out. You have eaten all the food. Actually, I had kept that for after. You are losing the plot, you know, Lorena. How much do you need for Brazil? 50,000? 100,000? I am doing it to get you out of this hole. We have always made a great team, right? Right? Shit! Hello. Would you have a minute? Please get in. How long have you known Adrian? Two to three weeks. I have known Adrian since he was born, so to speak. When he was born, his mother was already 44. Poor Adrian had it hard, his mother was a nightmare. He was an only child, which didn't help. Adrian was over 30 when he dared bring a girl home for the first time. You look like his first love. Adrian adored her. Why did you just tell me all this? You look like someone who wants to start a new life. A new start anywhere. I also dream of it. Although for me, it is not about a fresh start, but rather waiting for the end. Adrian is a man of principles, so am I. But sometimes it is better to give up one's old ideas and in fact I was counting on you to convince Adrian to renege on his principles. Nothing much. I am offering you 50,000 francs. So, do you have the money? If you can first show me the IOU. If you can first show me the 120,000. I cannot see any briefcase. The IOU, please. You will get it in the coming days. I am sorry? I am joking. Do you think it is a fake? She must have told you she owed me money. It is fine. It is the original. Do you know about that kind of thing? Yes. May I ask you to stop bothering Miss Lorena. Or what? Or you will see. Please excuse me. Adrian Weynfeldt. Hello, it is Lorena. Can you invite me for dinner? This time I am coming, for sure. I would love that. Shall I book at the Châteaubriand? I would prefer at yours. Perfect, as you wish. What would you like for dinner? Do you know how much 100 grams of Kobe beef cost? Forty-three francs. Do you realize? These animals are massaged every day and fed beer. At that price, we should serve them champagne. Madam, your mother, would never have allowed so much to be spent on a beef dish. Never! My dear mother spent on caviar what others will earn in a lifetime. Oh! Caviar, but this is beef. Leave it, I will deal with it. Leave it! I will answer myself. Adrian Weynfeldt. Hurry up, I am freezing my ass off! I am coming down. You can tell straight away it is good champagne. There are at least 1,000 little bubbles per sip and little bubbles are what is most important in champagne. Indeed. Grilled Kobe steak. No! You shouldn't have taken my whim literally. It was also easier for Mrs. Hauser. The more expensive the ingredients, the simpler the preparation. Who is that? The cook? My governess. My mother hired her in her lifetime. Does she bite? No, it is very rare. Please. Does sir wish anything else? No, that is all, Mrs. Hauser. Then I would like to take my leave. Good night, sir. I wanted to ask you if I could see your apartment again. Last time, if you recall, I was not able to fully appreciate it. Yes, of course. That is my office. The living room and the dining room you already know. All the landscapes were painted between 1880 and 1900. That is my bedroom and the bathroom. What is this mysterious door hiding? Nothing. It was my mother's bedroom. Oh! Is it taboo? Not at all, no. Wow! It is completely different from the rest. It has remained the way she had it. You have left everything as it was before? How touching. Is that her? Yes, that is her. In that portrait, she was 70. She looks down on us, right? Yes, that is her style. I wouldn't stand it. Wow! The same painting twice over! Felix Vallotton, "Femme nue devant une salamandre." 1900. What an ass! Magnificent! Is it worth a lot? The original, yes. These are copies? One of the two. Don't say anything. That is the original. Almost. This one? Bravo. How can you tell? For example through the signature. Here. Can you see the dot? After the surname? The original does not have one. The counterfeiter being careless. Normally, Vallotton always put a dot after his surname. But in this painting, there is none. What? You just have to look at the signature to distinguish a fake painting from an original? Not just that, there may be material clues. Vallotton always painted without using a back layer. You see? There is none and the patina is not authentic. You noticed it straight away, did you? No, not immediately. But after looking carefully, you can quickly tell it is a fake. In addition the counterfeiter always leaves his mark. A small deliberate detail, like a trademark. You can generally count on the counterfeiter's vanity. Can you show me this detail? Alas, I am still looking. Do you know who the counterfeiter is? Yes. It is an artist painter. As one says, escape artist or striptease artist. It is true. Would you like more bubbles? How come you have both paintings? Someone needs money but cannot resolve himself to sell the original. He would like me to auction the reproduction. Oh yes? And would you do it? Never. I would have bet on it, you are always so correct. Hyper correct. Refusing to take part in a scam is being hyper correct. A scam, I don't see why? You hadn't noticed anything. Well, not immediately. Don't move, wait. There! Now, they are identical. They are both fakes. Is it worth a lot? With any luck, 2, 3 million. Wow! If someone is prepared to pay that price for a painting, it makes it authentic. I had never seen things from this angle. Why not do it? Because it would not be correct. The visit is not quite over. The visit of the bedroom will have to wait until next time. It would not be correct. Thanks for this delightful evening. We can obviously count on the vanity of our striptease artist. -Through here. -Yes. No, not that. Don't take that. Yes. Veronique will acknowledge receipt of the painting at Murphy's. Thanks. She will get her conversation piece in the end. -Very well, gently. -Watch out! This chest of drawers survived five generations. Show some respect, please. No, that is not at all right. Overseeing a work site, I have other things to do. Madam your mother hated decisions taken hastily. Why act in haste? In haste? My mother has been dead for five years. The bedroom is always ready as if she would return one day, that is nonsense! But... I have decided on a gym. I ask you to respect my decision. I will call you without delay. -Thanks, goodbye. -Goodbye. Rolf, how are you? Excuse me. Is it allowed to put your mother's portrait up for sale? If no one did, there would never be any old ladies' portraits on the art market. Thank you for coming. In the end, which one is hanging? Incredible! It is the same painting. So, it changes nothing. Adrian! -Can you come for a minute? -Please excuse me. My deadly boring work awaits me. But I would be delighted to see you later. -This is Mr. and Mrs. Reiter. -Pleased to meet you. No dot. He is a pain. What was I thinking? A double gin. A double gin? Yes, I have just lost 50,000 francs. The same for me. You wouldn't be one of Adrian's friends? My treat. Rolf Strasser. I am a painter. I am an artist painter. As one says, escape artist or striptease artist. Oh! So, did you see what would be sold? Did you see any pretty things? I saw what I wanted to see. Someone with bad intentions tried to pass off a fake to Adrian. It failed miserably, of course. The copy is of pathetic quality. Is that right? Of course, Adrian saw immediately it was not the real one. Shall I tell you a little secret, sweetie? The Vallotton in the room is not a Vallotton. The salamander you saw is just a cheap fake. Look well. Can you see that tiny flourish in the cast iron? Oh yes. It looks a bit like a bud. For me, that detail looks more like a small ass. A small ass seen from the left, to be more precise. Do you notice anything here? The perspective is a bit different. It also looks like a small ass. But a small ass seen from the right, like the lady's big ass. It is quite crude, right? It is really strange Adrian did not see that detail. I am sorry. I am sitting down on a pack of money. Do you think it is fun? I was looking at a copy of Vallotton. Where is my money? A copy of what? A Felix Vallotton, the painter. Look. What an ass! What is this copy? What? No, forget it. It is nothing. Do you mean a fake? I don't have time. Bye. Wait! Do you know something that no one else knows? I can't tell you anything. When is the auction taking place? Tomorrow? Would you like to go? My very dear Theo, we have reached a point where our paths divide. Thanks for helping me. What are you saying? Didn't you need 100,000 francs for Brazil? That is done. It is sorted. Are you doing business behind my back? That is not how it works, we are a team. You have no right to... We could leave each other without fighting. Come on, Theo. We had some good times together? Can I come with you to Brazil? No. Why? Because you are a jerk, Theo. You bring me nothing good. Good riddance! Adrian Weynfeldt. It is me, Lorena. Can you open? I am coming down. I would never have believed it of you. Believed what? Come on, the Vallotton. What is up with the Vallotton? You know, stop it. You gave the new painting to the auction sale, didn't you? Did I do that? How did you realize? The flourish in the cast iron to the right. Your friend Strasser made me see the tiny difference: the small ass he has hidden. You had also found it. I ended up confounding you. -Admit it. -I admit it. Sir, it is my evening off. May I just remind you. Very well, Mrs. Hauser. You may leave. Thank you kindly. Yes, thanks. Now, close your eyes. There. Turn around. When I tell you, you look. And now for lot number seven. Femme nue devant une salamandre, by Felix Vallotton. Open your eyes. Due to the considerable interest generated by this piece, I start the auction at one million francs. Yes, 1.2 million, 1.3 million. Come close. I am real. 1.4 million. 1.4 million, 1.6 million in the room. 1.8 million for Veronique on the telephone. Thanks, Veronique. And 2.2 million here, in the room. 3.2 million francs on the telephone. And 3.4 million at the back of the room. 3.6 million for Mr. Weynfeldt's client, on the phone. 3.8 million. Number 33, 3.8 million for Mr. Weynfeldt's first client, on the telephone. And 4 million, 4 million, 4 million. What does Mr. Weynfeldt's other bidder say? 4.1 million for number 33. We are at 4.1 million. The sale is at 4.1 million. Once, twice, three times, sold. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. I wish you a safe return home. Place it on the easel, please. Only a few days left and we will leave together for the south. I knew you would end up changing your mind, Adrian. You are a true friend. The money? In the desk drawer. I am telling you right away, there are only 20 wads. No one would have thought it would sell for 3.5 million. You told me it would not go over 1.5 million. That is what was agreed. There should be 26 left. Be reasonable, Adrian. You have money. You want to deprive an old man in the twilight of his life of the little money he has left? Two million is more than generous, isn't it? It is not correct. You cannot do that. And that? An unplanned expense. Klaus, you are not an honorable man. Nor are you anymore, Adrian. You have new messages. Hello, Mr. Weynfeldt. It is Mr. Artmann, the director of the bank below you. Sir, could you call me back as a matter of urgency, please? Many thanks. I think we will start at a little million and that we will end around 4.1 million. Hello, I wanted to ask you if you had received my mail? What do you want? The same as last time, multiplied by 10. That makes 1.2 million. It is absurd. It is appropriate. Maybe you exaggerate the scope of the incident? Such things occur in all large auction houses. An accident, nothing more. A scandal! First a record price, then a fake. But how did you find out? Guess. Why can't you leave Lorena alone? Hello. I came to see Mr. Artmann, he is expecting me. I will tell him you are here. Mr. Weynfeldt, the reason why I asked you to come, is rather delicate. Mr. Schwartz, while routinely watching CCTV videos, made an unusual observation, and we consider it our duty to inform you. I hope you will not conclude that you are spied on by our services. All this is done with the greatest of discretion. Discretion, you know, is the key to our work. Mr. Schwartz, show us the recordings. It is the E4 camera installed above the entrance. The recording shows your visitor, Samba. Samba? We give visitors an internal code name. Oh! Have you given me one? You are W. The recording shows Samba accompanied by a man I know where I was working with local police. Theo Pedroni, sentenced for counterfeit, fraudulent bankruptcy and drug trafficking. At least these are the sentences I know of. That is what you wanted to show me, I guess? Yes. Good. Sir, are you not getting up? It's nine o'clock. I don't feel well today. Oh. But what does this mean? "Very dear Mrs. Hauser, please forgive the inconvenience. "I thank you for your loyalty during all those years." Did you intend to fire me? You didn't have the courage to tell me? No, it is not... But why on earth did you open this letter? My name is written on the envelope. Give me this letter. Let's forget about it. Call Veronique at the office. She should cancel all my appointments for today. You have the day off but before you go, make some puff pastries, please. And champagne, a lot of champagne. And why should I make puff pastries exactly? I will find grease stains everywhere. Oh! Why are we drinking? Let's drink to the millions. -Which millions? Yours? -Never mind. Oh, yes! Let's drink to the Vallotton millions. Oh yes? To the Vallotton millions. Who is number 33 at the auction sale? An art lover. An art lover who wishes to remain anonymous. It happens very often. More and more. 4.1 million. That is quite a sum. That is only the auction sale price. You have to add the fees. 20% up to 600,000, which makes 120,000. 12% on the rest, what makes 420,000. In the end, number 33 spent 4.64 million. Wow! Have you ever had such an amount of money before you? What kind of question is that? Of course. It is not that impressive. Would you like to see a million, before you? -Why? Do you have one at hand? -At hand, no. In my safe, yes. Do you want to see it? Behind you. Is that true ? Your safe is hidden behind that painting? Where all burglars will look first? Oh! 090807. Now, turn. Wow! You see? That represents a tenth. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. There are 12 wads of notes. That is nothing. One million. You expect to see a mountain of notes and it is nothing. One million. Easy as ABC. It is crazy how things lose their worth when you have them in abundance. Have you been to Brazil? No. Would you like to go? I hate travelling. Maybe you just need a bit of encouragement. I would have sworn you would never dare. It is because of me that you did it? Maybe. How do you feel now? Alright. Hello. I have a busy day, today. Please get dressed, I will call you a taxi. Do you want... me to give you my mobile number? It is nothing in the end. Count it. Here? Please, I insist. No, it is fine. I trust you. Mr. Weynfeldt, it is a pleasure to do business with you. The reverse is not true. Alas. Adrian Weynfeldt, hello. I would like to press charges, for extortion of money. Perfect, I will wait. Yes, who is here? Adrian. Adrian, is it you? Adrian, open. Adrian. I am very busy. I really don't have the time. Sorry. Please, Adrian. I need to speak to you. It is about Pedroni, the one you gave money to. It was a scam. I... I didn't owe him any money. All that story was a frame-up. Pedroni and I lived together but it finished a long time ago. He is a conman who pulls pathetic tricks. Shit, Adrian. I don't know... I am really sorry, I am sorry but if you only knew, with you, it is too easy to con you. You are so credulous, you are not made for this world. You think the others are as honest as you but life is not like that. Adrian, listen to me. I brought the money with me. I don't want it. Now, let me in, please. Shit, Adrian. You cannot leave me outside your house all alone. I have told you everything and you don't even reply. It is disgusting! So, I am not moving from here, I swear. And if I die of cold... Come in. There. My share of the 5,000. My share of the 120,000. Finally, my share of the 4.1 million. I don't understand. Why the 4.1 million? Baier. He offered me 50,000 francs if I managed to convince you to take the fake Vallotton to the auction sale. Are you joking? I just wanted to pocket the money and leave this place. I wanted to see if I managed to make you change your mind. It was a true challenge. Like a sporting feat. Is that all? I did not do it on purpose but I think Pedroni knows about the fake Vallotton. Has he called you already? How much does he want? He asked me to give him 1.2 million. Is that true? Of course, you give nothing. Too late. That is a pain. Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! What a bastard! I am really sorry, Adrian. All I have done is take advantage of you. And you have always been so honest with me. I thought that is what you found annoying. And at the store? Did you only call me to take advantage of me? No, that time I called you because I was in trouble. You know that since that morning on your balcony, since that time, I think that my life is in your hands, you know? If you had not come to the store, none of this would have happened. I would never have realized how easy it was to get money from you. Why did you save me that day? Because since I saw you in that bar, my life has also been in your hands. We should call the police. Do we have to? They will find your fingerprints on all the notes at Pedroni's. We need to give them an explanation. I underestimated you, I think. And here, for you, miss. Sorry, that is all I have. Theo Pedroni, police. I am arresting you for extortion of money. Since the start of the week, he's been exhausted. And then this morning, when I found him, he had stopped breathing. What did you want from him? Baier still owed me money. Why? For the reproduction? Shit! For fuck's sake! Idiota. Will you send me your address in Brazil? Come with me. Someone has to be there when you come back. Take care of yourself. You too, take care of you. Don't let yourself get scammed. Everyone is not as honest as you. Mrs. Hauser, I will do some exercise. I do not wish to be interrupted. Of course. Very well.
