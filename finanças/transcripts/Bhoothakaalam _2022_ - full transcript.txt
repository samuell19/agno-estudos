Plan T Films & Shane Nigam Films. Anwar Rasheed Presents. Mom... Mom... Grandma is awake. Careful... - Vinu... - Hmnn. We've to change her diaper. Can't we do this in the morning? Hold her. Come... Alright. There... lift her from here. Lift... a bit more! Got it? Yeah? Amma, we can't do this 4-5 times a day. We need to make some arrangement. - What arrangement? - Let's get a home nurse. And who'll pay for that? We can hardly meet ends on my salary. A home nurse... indeed! Come and hold her. Please hold her properly, Vinu! Haven't I been holding her properly all this while? Quickly, please! If you are doing it half-heartedly, don't do it. Go back to bed. 'Revathi' 'Shane Nigam' "The Past." It's OK. Isn't it better than being bedridden? Be at peace that her passing is for the better. [CRYING] [PRIYA CALLING] My mother... ...passed away recently. It is since then... ...I have been feeling like this. Why did you stop your medication? For a while... ...I had them as prescribed. Later... When I recovered... ...I stopped taking them. - You shouldn't stop like that. The previous doctor here would have instructed you clearly, right? Asha, you have clinical depression. It's a disorder. And it doesn't get cured like flu. You stopped your medication abruptly and hence... ...you are facing this issue now. You need to continue your medication. Please don't stop midway. Is there anyone in your family... ...with a similar medical history? My mother... She was quick-tempered. She'd get really upset over silly things. So... ...she clearly understood me. Whatever the problem... ...I was able to share with her. She was very supportive. Later she had a stroke... ...and lost her memory. Towards the end... She... ...even forgot my name. Who else is there at home? I have a son. He completed his D. Pharm... ...and is job hunting. And is your son like you? Does he open up to his mother? He is not like me. He is like his father. Two pegs, please. Vinu, will you be late? Hmm. Give me a call when you're free. So what are Vinu's plans now? What about his job hunt? He is still searching. He got a couple of offers. But they were far from here. So he rejected them. He can go for them now. If he gets something nearby, we can consider. What is he going to get here? If you need any assistance, aren't we all around? Let him go! If he leaves, won't I be by myself? Who else do I have? [SOUNDS FROM THE TV] - Vinu... - Hmm? Move the wheelchair to Grandma's room. I have cleaned it. [SOUNDS FROM THE TV] Didn't I just ask you to move it? Shall we put this on OLX (EBAY)? It is just lying around here. Just do as I ask! [SOUNDS FROM THE TV] Darn! - What fell? - Uh, nothing. - Huh? - Uh... Grandma's spectacles... - Did you break them? - No, no. I didn't. Move aside. You are so useless. - Four... - Four... - Five... - Five... - Six... - Six... - Seven... - Seven... - Eight... - Eight... - Nine... - Nine... - One... - One... - Zero... - Zero... Ten... Ten... [GOOD CHILDREN!] - Teacher... Teacher, if you go on leave so often... ...it is difficult for us to manage. Why don't you take a long break? Meanwhile, I'll appoint someone else here. No, that won't be necessary. Uh... I'll continue here. Please don't get me wrong... We are handling young kids here. If you could be a little more pleasant in your approach... You get what I am saying? [NURSERY RHYMES] [SHALL I DRAW?] [WHISPERS] Come, come here... [CRIES] [CRIES] - Hello? - Hey, I am outside. Am on the second floor. Is this material for a top? - Oh, it goes with this. - This is the dupatta. OK, how's this? Not bad, I liked the pink one actually. Ah! There you are. What's going on? - Birthday shopping. - Ah. Can you show me that one, please? - How's it? - It's nice. This color might look better actually. It's birthday, after-all! Any plans after this? What plan? I've to go home. That's it. - Priya... - What? Shall we go somewhere after this? No, Vinu. We can just go and... - I am not interested, Vinu. - Why? Now you have time, no? Huh? So, now you have the time to call me and meet me? I was in a messed up situation. What situation? Your Grandma's demise? That I can understand. What was the problem before that? Before that... I was not in the right mood. What? So you will call only when you're in the mood? - That's not what I meant... - Vinu... Calling me and meeting me... whenever you feel like, won't work. Hmm. It won't happen again. If it happens again, you can find another girl. Can I at least drop you? No need. I'll go with her. Hmm. My birthday is on Sunday. I insist you come over. S... ure I will. Come only if you are in the right mood... - You need to buy anything? - Uh, no. Here you go... How are things at home? Is your Mom fine now? - Hmm, she has to. - Hmm. - Hey... - Hmm? For the other day... That was for Rs 1000. - 1000? - Yeah! Can I pay the rest next week? I am leaving next week. - Where to? - Oh, I didn't tell you, right? - Remember, the job I told you about? - Uh, yeah... I decided to take it up. Should you take up that job after studying D. Pharm? We did D.Pharm for sure. But we didn't learn anything, right? Afterall, who is getting a job in their field of studies these days? We just want to somehow make it! - You heard about Sajin? - What? - He's getting married. - Marriage?! You didn't know? Don't you check your Instagram? - I'm not on Insta. - He's living the life! I'll show you. Here... that's the car he bought last week. Insta is about merely putting up a show. You and your cynical attitude! People are moving on with their lives. We are the only ones stuck here, with no respite. Aren't you having dinner? Not now. So you don't want it at all? Can I make some Maggi (NOODLES)? And who is going to eat... What I prepared... Just eat this. Unnecessarily troubling others... Jimmy... move aside. I said... move! Hope you have lab experience. Yes, sir. I have completed 100 hours as Pharma Assist. Hmmn. Why do you have a career gap of one and a half years? Sir, my family situation was such that I needed a job in this town. So... I was trying to something here and... - In this town? - Yes, sir. I live here. Sir, are we hiring for this town? No, we haven't given any advertisement specifying that. We're not looking for someone to work in this town. We are looking for someone who can take up outstation work too. Uh Sir... Your cousin Felin... ...must've called you regarding a candidate? That's me. So? Why are you smiling for that? Listen, we work for a corporate company. When you attend an interview that we conduct... ...shouldn't you follow basic etiquette? Look at you... you haven't even shaved! My grandmother passed away recently. So, I couldn't shave (FOR RELIGIOUS REASONS). Dude, even this sir's grandmother passed away last week. Yet, see how he has come... Tell me about your family. Only my mother. And your father? My father died when I was 7. What does your mother do? She is a school teacher. Ah! She managed to teach other kids. Yet, she couldn't teach her own kid anything! These days no one wants to hear anyone's sentiments. You may leave now. What a waste of time! Send in the next candidate, please! Hey Vinu! What's up?! - When did you get here? - Where were you? I stepped out leaving my phone here for charging. And what's up? - So you're leaving next week, huh? - Yes, next Thursday. Hmm. Here, have a sweet. Got some to celebrate getting a job! Grandma, want one? She's not supposed to have anything sweet. And what else? You know... here... ...I am not finding a job... - I tried really hard. - OK... This place that you've joined... You think you could... I am going to work in a hotel, man! That is OK. Anything will do! I need to get out of here somehow. Got it? Once I am there, may be I can look for something else later. What about your mother? Did she agree? That's OK. I'll get her to agree somehow. Let me talk to them. I'll get it done. Then shall I get going? Stay for a bit... We can chill in the backyard. No, I've some work today. - You sure? - Yes. - So... I'll see you then. - OK, then... - Hey, listen... - Yeah? We should have a drink and celebrate before I leave, OK? Sure! Let me know when. - Give me a call. - I will. [SHOCKED] Hey! - Nah, he won't do anything. - Darn! Hey! - Alright, then. - Alright! [PHONE BEEPS] [PHONE BEEPS] You started smoking again? No. I got a lighter from your pants' pocket. That... I bought... for something else. I forgot what it was for. What about the job? I didn't get it. Why? They rejected saying that I have a career gap of one and a half years. I don't think I'll find anything here, Mom. So, you plan to sit at home jobless? Jobless? I got a job in Salem. You didn't let me go from here! That's because our circumstances was such! I thought you'd have understood. I didn't know it would take this much time... Yeah, they've stacked and saved for me... ...all these jobs. No point saying that. Everyone goes through the same. You should try somewhere else. I am not looking here any more, Mom. Then? Shyam has said... ...he will get me a job. Where? The same hotel that he is going to work at. We spent so much on your education and you'll work at a hotel? What's wrong with that? Not everyone finds a job in the field they studied. Vinu, try and stick to one field. You said you want to do MBBS first and then quit it. Then you took up D. Pharm. Do you know how much has been spent on all this? Don't even talk about MBBS now, Mom! I told you a hundred times that I won't be able to do it! You pushed me, saying it was a professional course, it has a certain status... Don't make me say things I don't want to! And now I don't even have a job...! Oh! So that's also on me! Asking you to study, you not getting a job... - ...it's all my fault. - Yes, it's your fault. Yes! It's your fault, Mom! I wish Dad was around... Someone would have understood me. When your Dad was around... ...all he made was a huge debt and a bad name! I still haven't paid it all back! Now you go and make some more! A hotel job! Is this how I raised you?! You are doomed! You are out to destroy your life, like your father. I don't care if it's destroyed. I'm leaving this time, Mom. You'll go nowhere. I'd like to see how you leave. I'll lock you up! Aargh! You have to say something and get me... Mom! I need to talk to you, Mom! You can't walk away in the middle of a conversation every single time! Mom! [CRIES] It's OK, dear. Don't cry... That was... ...by mistake. How can that happen by mistake? That kid's nose is broken. She hasn't stopped crying. Her parents are on the way. It was an accident, sir. I didn't do it on purpose. I had told you if you aren't well, please go on leave. I am absolutely fine. If nothing is wrong, then why are you taking so many medicines? Anyway, now... I am in trouble. If the media comes to know of this, it will cause a huge uproar. Who knows what type of people the parents are. Sir, shall I speak to the parents? All that is not needed! Listen, please stay away for a while. Why did you break it? Me? No, I did! Tell me, why did you break it? I said... I did not! Apart from one of us, who else is there in this house to do it? Vinu, I don't want to fight early morning. Listen... ...don't take out your anger on my phone. All I have is my phone and bike. You're the one fiddling on your phone all the time. It must have broken. What is your problem, Mom? Is it because you're having all these medicines? It's OK. It can be fixed. Good thing Grandma passed away. - Back then, she bore the brunt of your issues - Hey! Don't you dare talk about my mother! Why not? Weren't you also waiting for her to die anyway? Get out of here! Yeah, that's the plan. I will leave. No matter how hard the times were... ...I never let him feel his father's absence. Whatever he wanted... ...a computer, mobile, a motorcycle... ...I bought him whatever he wished for. Yet he... It's the same in all families. Don't take these things so seriously. In my family... ...there are only problems, always. Let me write you a medicine. Take it before you sleep. If you feel like there is a problem, or you feel like talking, just come over. Alright? Don't hurt yourself more by over-thinking it. Please try to relax first. Go for a walk. Have an ice cream. You'll feel better. "Like the cloud that eclipses..." "...the time goes on..." "...now yours!" "What's there to say... I wonder!" "In the words..." "...flow a song!" "This endless distance from you..." "...goes on endlessly!" "Or is it just a dream?" "The path the clouds move..." "...can you see it?" "...shall we go?" "Oh nightly star!" "You shimmer on this night!" "Whom do you seek..." "Within me?" "Whom do you seek?" "Oh rhythm of a song..." "Oh the nectar-filled flower..." "Did your petal brush me?" "Or did you touch the spark within me?" "A time where time has no limits..." "...is what we seek!" "The path the clouds move..." "...can you see it?" "...shall we go then?" "Oh nightly star!" "You shimmer on this night!" "Whom do you seek..." "Within me?" "Whom do you seek?" Mom! Mom! Stop fooling around... Open the door! MOM! [CRIES] Mom... Mom! Mom! Mom... [SCREAMS] Open the door, Mom! Mom! Mom! MOM... Mom...! 'Intermission' [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Asha...? I called to say... Vinu is here. Vinu...? Asha...? - Asha, can you hear me? - What for? I'll tell you... when you get here. Just get an auto-rickshaw and come over. OK. He came here early in the morning. He didn't tell you while leaving, Asha? He says he saw your mother. That she locked him up in a room. He's been blabbering some nonsense. I think he has a problem. Remember what I told you then? That I saw him coming out of a bar? That was in the afternoon. I know you didn't take it seriously. He drinks everyday, Asha. Look at him. He looks frail and weak! I don't... interfere in his matters. You should intervene! That is the problem. Hope you haven't forgotten the past. We barely made it that time! If it happens again... What should I do now...? I looked after Amma all these years. And now I must stay home and look after him? That's not what I meant, Asha. We need to sit him down and explain things to him. OK. I'll talk to him. No, I don't think he will listen to us anymore. He needs to be... ...counseled. That's the only way out. - But... - I know the right person. - But... - I'll take care of it. You have your tea. Counselling? What for? So now I am the one who needs to be counseled?! - Mr. Madhu? - Yes. - Did you've trouble finding the address? - No... I got a bit confused after getting into this lane. This is George. - This is Vinu's mother. - Ah. George runs a counseling service in town. Quick-mind Counseling... No... Freshmind Counseling. I've given George an idea... - Like I said... - I get it. That's an area we focus on. Uh... smoking addiction... alcoholism. Let's try, Sir. ...and then... - ...the door shut. - Hmm. And then it got locked. - And then I saw... - Hmm. Then... ...how did the door open finally? After a while it opened by itself. And? And then I stepped out. OK... And there was no one there. And then when I went to Amma's room... - ...she was also not there. - Oh, is it? That's when I went to my Dad's brother's house. Why do you think you felt these things? Feeling? - I am telling you what I saw. - That's what... Why do you think you saw these things? Well... what can I say... No no... relax. Don't get tensed. Relax yourself and answer. I am relaxed. But you aren't understanding what I am saying. - No, I get it. - What? I got it. I was just... asking. Uh... Vinu... Do you drink? Drinking is not a bad thing. Do you? I mean, last night or evening... ...did you have a drink? I didn't. And smoking? Yes. Cigarettes? So, when you got stressed... ...did you smoke something else other than cigarettes? Listen, you can trust me. Be comfortable. I've been through all these things. - No, I didn't. - Come on, be open. NO! Hmm. Isn't this rolling paper? This right here? Come on. Why are you staring at me like that? Say something. Be comfortable. You should leave. Don't say that! - Leave. - See... You... you relax a bit. I am not here to trouble you. Leave. Please try to understand. Whatever is on your mind... let it come out. - Just leave. - See, I will help you. I am fine. Please leave. I know you're fine. I know that. There is no problem. I know... I know. So... So what happened yesterday... - ...that feeling... - Just leave, Sir. OK. Has he created such issues before? Not really... When he was in college... he used to get drunk and... He was always a headache for us. The boy was enrolled in MBBS. Look at him now. - Oh, what happened? - He wouldn't attend classes. He wouldn't answer calls. He wouldn't come home. You know what we heard when we went to check? It seems he hadn't stepped out of his room for 4-5 days. All he did was drink and smoke. His mind... is completely troubled. I think he hasn't slept for at least three days. Any human who hasn't slept in 48 hours could hallucinate. He will imagine visuals and sounds. That can be dangerous. And if his family history is as you say... ...his mother's issues, grandmother's... This could be an extension of that. Should we take him to a doctor? Not yet, Sir. Let me try again. We'll take a call after that. I'll come again tomorrow. OK. [SOUNDS FROM THE TV] There was some sound there. Some sound... - I'll check. - No... There is no one there, Vinu. It was a loud sound! And you didn't hear anything? No, I didn't. So, I am the one hearing these voices now...? Please try to sleep... - Everything will be fine. - What will be fine?! Huh? I am the one listening to it all! Hi, teacher.. How are you? All good? Yes. Aren't you working today? - I am on leave. - Ah! Isn't your son around? Haven't seen him in a while... Uh, hmm. He is inside. - Asha? - Yes... Please go in. Dr. Beena...? Doctor Beena got transferred. Please have a seat. Alright, tell me. What's the problem? Sir... - No one is home. - Where did they go? Don't know. The teacher left early. Later I saw the boy also leave. Oh. Sir... Don't stand there alone for a long time. Why? Something about that house isn't right. What did you say about that house? - Who is it? - He came to visit the teacher. They've gone out. Are you a relative? No, I am here to meet her son. Oh, alright. Uh, what were you saying about that house? That... nothing else... There is something wrong with that house, sir. Everyone who lived there has faced some problem. Isn't it their own house? No! They're on rent. We never go there. But... why? A man who was living there, hanged himself to death. He did not die alone. Poor thing... He poisoned his wife and kid. They too died. We came to know only after 5-6 days, when it started stinking... Have you gone inside? The room in front of the entrance. - That's where he... - Nah! - That's where the wife and the kid lay. - No, that's where he was. - He was in the next room! - Fine... wherever then. When was this? That must've been about... - ...6-7 years back, right? - Yeah. Yeah, about 6-7 years back. Then, the house remained locked for 2-3 years. And later they started renting it out. But none of the tenants would stay long. 2-3 months at the most. - The last person was a banker, right? - Right. - What was his name? - Anand? Correct! Anand. He was a really nice man. One day, he too tried to hang himself. But luckily, he didn't die! He made it alive. Hello? Is this George? I am Vinu's mother. Ah, tell me Ma'am. You said you'll come today. When will you be coming? Uh, that... Madam... uh... I am not in town. I was about to call Mr. Madhu. Last night... ...he behaved in a completely bizarre way with me. Can you do something? I can bring him there, if you'd prefer that. Uh, no. That's not needed. Let me call you once I am free. Alright. Any updates on my case? - What case? - The job? Oh, yes. I will talk to them, man. You forgot about it? No man! Let me get there. I'll set you up. - Mix some water too. - I need only soda. Here we go. Come on, let's raise a toast! Cheers... Cheers... Cheers! Go for it, man! Come on! Catch it! Come here, let me pour you another one. Where... where is the stuff? Hey! Come on! Here you go... Hmm. Why are you standing aside? Come here. Let's dance! Dance! Here! You come here... [MUMBLES SOMETHING] Hey, look! Hey.. Hey... That's OK, no problem! Don't worry! No problem! I'll do it. Step aside. Careful with your hands. Nobody should cut their hands, guys! Blood should not be spilt! Hey.. I need to take a leak. - What? - I need to pee. - Go inside... - Inside? Yeah, use the washroom. Yeah, that way. Go in and take a right. [SHRIEKS] What is it? What is it? - Hey, what happened? - Nothing. What is it! Hey... I will... ...clean it. - No, it's OK. - Come... - I suddenly... Come... come... Come... Take him. Sit, it's alright. Mom... Can I sleep with you tonight? I don't want to sleep in my room. - Why aren't you answering the call? - It's her. I told you... it's that lady. Whatever it is, just answer. What if it's an emergency? No. It is not necessary. Anyway, I am going call Mr. Madhu and tell him. - Is it because you are scared? - Not at all... Not because I'm scared. Just because someone said something, don't leave the case. Find out if there is any truth in what they are saying. After that you can take a call, right? - You're Mr Rajan? - Yes... I called you in the morning to ask about your house. I don't have anything other than what I said over the phone. You needn't have come. - Have a seat. - Thanks. Is the house for you or are you a broker? Sir... it is for a friend of mine. I thought I'll just enquire. The house is on sale. I've rented it out now. Sir... I came to ask something else too. In that house... ...I heard that some tragedy had happened. A family living there... did something... Not just 'some family'. That was my son and his family... You came to ask that? Sorry, sir, I didn't know that. He was in some sort of a problem and... Right? He did not have any problem... She was the problem! His wife. After they got married, they built the house and moved in. She was the first one who said that the house had some problem. Later she started saying that my son was mentally ill. Saying it repeatedly, she eventually made him completely crazy... ...and made him do unspeakable things. If the townsfolk are right... ...he poisoned his wife and child and died by hanging himself. It's now a story that people like you can talk about. Has no one ever died in your house? Haven't you continued staying there? Isn't it just a house? Made of stones, mud, cement, and wood... - Is this Mr. Anand's house? - Yes, who is it? - Is he here? - Yes. - Come in. - OK. Sleeplessness was his main problem. The doctor said it was due to stress. He asked me to serve food and went into his room... When I went in... I saw him hanging... Because I saw him on time, he could be saved. But this is his condition since then. And... He kept saying he saw someone and heard some things in that house. Apart from both of us... ...there was no one there. But... If you watch closely... ...you can see someone else too there, he says. Why did you want to meet so urgently? Hmm? Can we go somewhere? Go...? Where? Somewhere far away. You wanted to meet so urgently to say this? Not that. Then? - Please take what I am saying seriously, OK? - Okay. Tell me. I told you about getting locked up in the room, right? - And that my phone was broken? - Yeah? That wasn't Amma. Then? I don't know. There is something there. What thing? Vinu... You know... I haven't slept in 4 days. I... When I think of something... I... I can't understand what is happening to me. I am... And Mom has arranged some guy to counsel me... - Counseling? - Yeah! Counseling. She got a counselor saying I've a problem. Vinu... Why didn't you tell me this sooner? Huh? I can't continue in that house, Priya. - Can we go somewhere? - Vinu... If you spring this on me all of a sudden... You do one thing... Go home and get some sleep. Get some rest. Uh... What did the counselor say? Forget it. It's OK. Vinu... - Sorry, brother! - Get lost! Hey move! Get away. Catch him! The fellow is crazy! Let go off me! I'll kick the life out of him! Hey... hey... Hey, stop it. Don't kick. Don't do that. Get him away, guys. Pin him down. - I'll kick him! - Please leave... - Enough... move aside! - He is crazy! Asha, if you had been more careful about him... ...this wouldn't have happened. No point in saying it now. He needs proper rest, Asha. I'll look after him. I'll ensure that my son doesn't go anywhere. That is not what I meant! He needs proper institutional rest. That includes therapy and medication. Look at him, Asha. He is ruining himself. Until now, only we knew about it. Now he is a nuisance for others too. There isn't much to think now. There is a hospital nearby. You don't need to worry, Asha. I'll manage. - Hello? - Sir... Regarding Vinu's case... ...I feel there seems to be some truth in what he was saying. When I enquired about that house, I learnt that the house has some problems. The problem is not with the house... It's with him. Today he got into a fight at the bar. I got him home somehow. Sir, can I just speak to him once? No, George. That is not required. I don't think this can be fixed with counseling. We are taking him to a hospital tomorrow. Sir, I just want to talk to him once. No, George. Mental hospitals are the best remedy for mad people. I'll call you later. Eat your food. I am not hungry. Your tiredness will wear off only if you eat. Then you'll have sound sleep. Tomorrow morning, everything will be fine. Don't be scared. Do you know what I am scared of, Mom? The fear of our loved ones not understanding us. In everyone's eyes, I am... ...I am someone with a problem. Do I have any problem, Mom? Don't cry, Mom. Are you crying because of me? I won't hurt you again. Mom... No one understands me, Mom. You should stand by me, Mom. Don't you understand...? Don't you see me? Who is all this for? What have I lived all my life for? In my life... ...I've made a number of mistakes. I don't want you to repeat those mistakes... that's why... I thought you had something against me... Don't cry, Mom... Don't cry, Mom. Don't cry. Mom... Don't cry. It's OK. Mom! Mom! What is it, Vinu? What? - The glass moved... - What? - Huh? - Yeah! - What is it? - [CLICKS TONGUE] [BOTH SCREAM] Mom! MOM! - Where's your phone? - Uh? Where is your phone? No. I don't have the phone. [MUFFLED SCREAM] [INAUDIBLE] [SHRIEKS IN FEAR] Front door... front door! Where is the key? On top of the fridge. Don't Vinu... [CRIES] Look at me... Give me the keys. Vinu, give me the keys! Give it! Give! [GASPS] I don't believe in these things. They wanted to move out. Fine, OK! This is all we can do. - These are personal experiences of people. - Hmnn. We should help them in the way we can. But if we start thinking like that, which house can we live in? - Every house will have its own problems. - Hmnn. In any case, what we wished for has happened. - The mother and the son have reconciled. - [SMILES] Other than that, there is no point in us overthinking this... ...and getting trapped in this house! - Right? - Right. What are you thinking, Son? Nothing. You said you will tell me... ...everything from now on. I was thinking... ...about the people who'll live here next. [SIGHS]
