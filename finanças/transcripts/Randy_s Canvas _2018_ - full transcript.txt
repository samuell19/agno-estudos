Hey, Marylin. - Thank you, Henry. - Have a good day. - And you, too. - Keep smiling, all right? MAIN TITLE Now, take a look at Picasso's Guernicafor example. The severity of the screams, they're crying out in anguish. They're trapped in a black and white and shades of gray world. They're being devoured and destroyed. Do you see it? No, but you do, and that's cool. Good night, Security Bob. Randy. Randy, you forgot your-- YELLOW PERIL GALLERY Boring. Stale. Done. Bereft. Tragico. Si. Tell me, Butch, what does this place lack? - Better art. - Try again. - Um... - What does this place lack? - You. - Yes, me! Apologies. These artists, they're sold in galleries across the nation. Discovered by a two-bit consignment store whose proprietors fancies themselves a keen eye. This is crap, crap, crap, crap, crap. This-- this is not crap. RAW - This is-- - "RAW"? Yeah. - You Randall? - Where's Bob? He got canned. Are you Randall? Yeah, I am. Come on with me. Picasso, he was being harassed by German soldiers. Are you Randall? One of the officers, he saw the painting... ...in Picasso's apartment. You can't hang your own art in the gallery. I didn't put that art there. And he asked Picasso-- he said, "Did you do that?" You can't get someone else to do it either. Bob was relieved of his post earlier. Bob would never leave his post. And Picasso's response was no, you did. Please, Bob's a nice guy. He's my friend. We're gonna have to terminate you as well. - Terminate? - It's vandalism, Mr. Whitsey. No, this is vandalism. Hello, this is Henry. He's up there. Thanks, bud. - Go away, Dick. - Hey, buddy, it's me. Redlocks? Yeah. Open up the door. You may enter. - I don't wanna enter. - Well, I'm not leaving. Man. It smells awful in here. I'm sorry. I threw up. They fired me. I'm really sorry. Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sorry. It's okay. It's okay, it's their loss. But I like it here. What, in the bathroom? Hey, remember when Ma had to leave? Do you? We didn't like that either, but there was nothing we could do about it. So what did we do, hmm? What did we do? We moved on together, and we found our feet. Can we do that again? - Find our feet? - Yeah, that's right. Find our feet. What are you smirking at? You should see what I'm seeing, man. You're a mess. - Yeah, I'm a mess. - Yeah. Well, I'm ready to go now. All right, let's get out of here. Got it. You have the pleasure of speaking to Maurizio D'Oro. - And? - You must be RAW. I'm here to apologize. Look, I'm a lot of things and raw is definitely one of them. But why are you apologizing? May I come in? - Uh... sure. - This is nice. Very well. I've come to offer you a job. - A job? - As I understand it, I cost you your job at the Yellow Peril when I inquired about your artwork hanging on display. I'm here now to make amends. Oh. What's wrong? Your work is good. You just need guidance, refinement. You need moi. I like your look, though. Ruggedly handsome for a painter. Hey, Randy? Come here, buddy. This is my brother, Randy. All right, and it's him you owe the apology to. Randy, this is Mr. Mazarino. Maurizio D'Oro. Maurizio of Gold, yeah. It's 'cause of him you got fired. Have a seat. So you're RAW? RAW's an acronym for my name. It's for Randall Andrew Whitsey. Of course it is. But also RAW, you're more ways than one. You have talent, but you need to cultivate it. You are but stone-- an uncut diamond. Once we have you cut, you will shine like the gem you are. You will be brilliant. - Wait, what? - What would you say if I told you I have a good friend at New England Tech who can help you expand your skills? Gratis? - A school for art? - Precisely. Yeah, I don't know, to me, school just teaches you things that I'd probably never use. You're being pessimistic. School is for people like you. There's nothing wrong with me! I don't need your help, and I don't need your school. - Wait, Randy. - No, I just, I don't want to do that. I'm sorry. If you know what's good for your brother, you'll see that he's in my gallery tomorrow morning, 11:00 a.m. It'll be a shame to miss the kind of opportunity that I'm prepared to offer him. Good-bye. - Thanks for coming. - Coat! Yeah. ARTPROV GALLERY OPEN NOW And the boy who can paint arrives. Hi. Come. Enter. Be amazed. Butch, two Cabernet, chop-chop. MADCREATIV It's 11:00 a.m. Yes, of course, make it Chardonnay. Your face. Durango, magnifico,? A rare palazzo. Of course, not so rare for my galleria. - This one. - The boy speaks. And it would appear you have quite the eye. Do you like? I don't recognize the artist and it's probably for a good reason. It's not very good. Why did you buy that work? I didn't. I painted it. Come, drink with me. Oh, do you have iced coffee with no ice? You'll be responsible for phones, setting up showing, helping clients with whatever they want. Claro? - You want me to work out there? - Yes, as a receptionist. I'd rather clean. Can I be your custodian? A janitor? You want to be my janitor? A janitor is often a synonym for custodian. I have a service that cleans for me, Randy. I would do a better job, and it would cost you less. - A lot less. - Mamma mia. One step back, two steps forward, I hope. Are you sure you want to be my janitor? Yes. Yes, I'm sure. Buongiorno, ArtProv Gallery will be closed for renovation, and I won't be needing your service until we reopen. Grazia, arrivederci.

You did well today. I will have you back on Wednesday. You don't want me back tomorrow? Tomorrow you'll meet with Maxwell von Hausdorff. - Sounds German. - Tragically so. Well, why do you want me to meet with German Maxwell von Hausdorff? Have a seat. Don't worry, have a seat. So he's a renowned art professor. I told him about your work, and he's agreed to meet you. Possibly give you a trial in his class. A scholarship? Tuition costs $40,000 a year, sweetheart. Not a scholarship, at least not yet. But if he likes your work, you will be auditing his class. Audit his class? Dear me, boy, you will take his class. But I don't have enough money. You'll be auditing the class! Which means you will take it for free for the time being, but you won't be enrolled. So you're the boy Maurizio's been raving about. I believe you have something for me. Ah, let's take a look! Ah ah. Yeah. Oh. Have you anything else? Uh... Uh-huh. Oh, now this one interests me. - What is that? - That, a cocktail napkin. Yeah, indeed, but what is the work that - is on the cocktail napkin? - Sweet Sienna. Oh, yeah. Almost a found art quality. A touch of realism. A genuine rare. Strong angles. Strokes reminiscent of Victorian charcoal. Und how did you create this red and yellow hues? Ketchup and mustard. Yeah, yeah. Very good, I think you can audit my class if you wish. A special session has already begun, but I believe I can bring you up to speed. So right here, Monday morning, 11:30 a.m. - Don't be late. - Yeah. That should be good, yeah. - Okay. Thank you.

My real parents, they abandoned me when I was five in the lobby of Women & Infants Hospital and then Redlocks and my mom-- my real mom. I call her my real mom. They brought me in and raised me ever since that. - You're blessed. - Hmm. Do you ever wonder about your real parents? No, 'cause they left me, and I barely knew them. So I have Redlocks who's my brother and then my mom-- my real mom and I have a roof over my head and my house and that's all that really matters... - Right. - ...are my roof, my mother... Yeah. I miss my home. Are you not happy here? I came from a small town in Mexico when I was younger. My dad got a job here and ever since we've been here, my parents just tell me to find some rich American boy to marry. That seems backwards. Yeah. That's what I thought, too. Is Clinton a rich American boy? Yeah. I guess I'm just hoping that he's something more than that. He's not very nice to you, Sienna. No, he is. I wanna be with somebody that wants to be with me and doesn't need me. Yeah. So are you a Patriots fan, Red Sox? I don't like sports. - What? - Yeah, sports are dangerous. I thought every guy likes sports. Not this guy. Have you been to a game before? Redlocks, he says I have no game. Well, you'll have to come to a game with me sometime. Big crowds, they make me nervous. I'll be there with you. - You'll be fine. - Yeah. Hey, thanks for taking this walk with me tonight. Yeah, can I have your number so I can contact you about the game? Well, Henry doesn't know what he's talking about because that's some game you have there. - Is that me? - Oh, it's a work in progress. Um... can I have my pencil? Yeah, okay. That's-- yeah. Thank you. Ah, Mr. Whitsey. Welcome. Welcome. Mr. George, please take position one. - Why? - Mr. Whitsey, please take position three next to Ms. Monroe. Go on, please. Hi, my name's Randy.

He's very well-defined, and I can see why you chose him but his body will-- it will effectuate realism, so it's a good choice. Very good.

I cannot teach you if you're not following my lessons. I don't like your lessons, it's... Fair enough. But this is a very special class that NEIT is offering. Something unique. And you constantly defying my syllabus, it's not just a problem for me. It's also a problem for the other students as well. It's a distraction. I don't want to be a distraction. Yeah, I know you don't. But they are distracted. May I go to class now? - I don't-- - Where were you yesterday? I was at a baseball game. Baseball? So you think baseball is more important than art? Of course not, but I was with Red-- I don't care who you were with. If you miss one more class, your time here is done. Verstehe? Get, get, get! - Buonasera, Randall. - Mr. Gold. Come with me. Have you heard of the artist Mauricio Callegari? Painted Il Trágico, 1879. Molto bene. And only Il Trágico. Do you know why? - No. - Because he was caught sleeping with his patron's wife. His patron then cut his penis off and slipped the knife into his belly and spilled his entrails all over the piazza. The point being is many men's downfall has been a woman of lust. I don't understand. I hope you never do. Maurizio D'Oro. ♪ Going to war he said ♪ I'll leave my mother ♪ I'll leave my bed ♪ The silence It comes for me... ♪ - Everything okay? - No. - What's wrong? - Just please be quiet, okay? ♪ He left at dawn That day... ♪ I don't mean to pry. Sometimes when life sucks I go to this beach in Narragansett. It's really beautiful at night. It helps clear my head. I hope things get better for you. Me, too. ♪ He said "Now you know this isn't" ♪ ♪ This isn't where You're supposed to be... ♪ - What's your problem? - Everyone's against me. - What? - They all hate her. Who hates who? My sweet Sienna, they hate her. - They're jealous of us. - You lost me. Never mind, okay? All right, look, whoever Sweet Sienna is, however sweet she may be, she seems to be clouding your judgment. How would you know? I heard Maurizio and Hausdorff talking, and they said you're fixated on some subject. All right, and it's affecting your work. Yeah, we'll be talking. You think it's wrong I paint Sweet Sienna in the German's class? She has a name and an adjective. How appalling. Look, I never met the girl, but it's clear that she has a spell on you. One that you're unable to control. It's all the German's fault. I doubt that. But he does not like that you won't paint what he asks. - He says that all the time. - Well, I suggest you listen. When are you gonna give me my own show? Excuse me, Randall, but your insolent tone is off-putting. When are you gonna give me my own show? When you show some respect. When your art is up to par and worthy of being displayed at the ArtProv Gallery. My galleria! When you appreciate the opportunities presented to you. I think you should go back to work now. We'll discuss the show when I'm ready. Go! - Autism? - I think so. High-functioning. It all makes sense. He has amazing talent, but he seems to be unaware of his condition. If you cut him off, he'll never be able to realize what he can do. I will allow him to continue, provided he stops painting that girl. - I don't know if the girl-- - You think that I'm retarded? That I'm not capable of painting anything other than a single subject? Of course not, but you bursting into my office like this does not help your case. I am not mentally retarded. - Randy-- - One day I will be a brilliant artist and you will respect me. If I wanna paint Sienna every day of the week I will, whether you hate her or not. - Randy-- - No! No! You kissed my girl! You think you can do whatever you want because you're special? Stop! - Stop, Clinton! Stop, stop! - Come on, fight back. - Stop! Stop! - Come on, fight back. Clinton, stop! Clinton, stop! She's all I have, Randy. I couldn't find my bike. What happened? Well, apparently you got a good old-fashioned ass-kicking. - Did I fight back at least? - That's not important. It is. It's very important. What matters is that you're okay now. Thank you, Mr. Gold. You are an outstanding artist, Randy. You have amazing raw talent. Pun intended. But you're lacking the critical understanding of the art form. You're also lacking control of your emotions. What makes great art is this in tandem with this. Heart and head in harmony. Your emotions and your mind, they don't work together like most people. I must ask. Do you have autism? When I was-- when I was three years old, I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome but in 2013, the DSM-5, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 has defined it and other forms of autism inclusively as this is one thing. It's autism spectrum disorder. It's all one thing. It's not-- yeah. It's just one, yeah. - It's not a-- - It's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Don't be sorry. Autism, it's what I have. It's not who I am. I'm just-- I'm just Randy. Randy. I will give you a hug right now, but I suppose that will make you uncomfortable. - You can do it for two seconds. - Cool. - Two seconds, okay. - Well, three but only three. Three it is. One, two... Clinton told me what happened. I'm sorry that he hurt you. How is he? He's all right, I guess. He's hurt on the inside, too. I mean, I feel bad for him. You're so sweet. No, you're sweet, Sienna. I really think so. Thank you, Randy. Do you wanna see something in my studio? Sure, yeah. Are these me? Yeah, you inspire my feelings. How do I do that? I don't know, you just-- you just kind of do. You're a really strong person, and I wanna be as strong as you. Can you sit on that stool so I can paint? - Sit? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, on the stool. Okay. Cool. What do you want me to do? Look natural. Well, it's not really natural for me to just randomly pose for you. Okay. All right, listen to this. I got music and stuff-- it's what I do. - It's... - What song should I listen to? I'll get that. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it's a good one. Put them-- yeah.

Yeah, you mean somebody. Don't say it like that. - Don't say it like what? - Like you're mad at her. You're upset 'cause you had sex with her, and she rejected you. - Did you wear a condom? - Look, she didn't reject me. And we didn't have sex, all right? Well, what about you? When are you gonna see Mom? Don't change the subject, all right? She's dying. And you pretend like she's on some kind of big vacation. Hey, this ain't about me, all right? No, it's about me! It's always been about me! Why am I the only one that's supposed to change? You say you want more and when you get a free moment, you're out drinking it away in a bar. - Hey, that is enough! - It's not enough! It's never enough! I'm sick and tired of being told what's good for me. - I know what's good for me. - Look at me. You're about to make a fool of yourself right now. - Calm-- - I know me. I know me. What's his name? Harlan. But you know something, if you want this dog, you can call him whatever you want. No, his name's Harlan. Redlocks, meet Harlan. Hey, beautiful. Come here. You think you can give this dog a loving home? - Yeah. - Yeah? Can we keep him? DR. TIM'S PREMIUM ALL NATURAL PET FOODS Yo, Randy? Yo, buddy, get up. Come on, we're gonna be late. Hurry up. Are you feeling stressed, Randy? Very stressed. I don't know how she feels about me. I see. This is not good. Swelling in your face, hands, mouth, and throat. Chest tightness, trouble breathing, fast flow, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Fever, sweating, confusion, or muscle stiffness. Increased hunger or thirst. Change in how often you urinate. Lightheadedness, dizziness, or fainting. Numbness or weakness on one side of your body. Sudden or severe headache problems with vision, speech, or walking. Painful or prolonged erections. Seizures or tremors. Breast soreness and nipple discharge in both women and men. And trouble swallowing, too. Yeah, I can't take this. I just... TAKE 1 TABLET EVERY TO 8 HOURS I have something that should raise your spirit. I'm hosting a showcase of several artists and photographers, and I'd like to offer you a spot. One piece. Your best work. Really? You want to show my work? One piece. Make it great. Make it RAW. Salute. You can drink. Randy! Congratulations. Oh, what for? The show. Professor told me. - Yeah. - I'm really excited for you. Yeah, cool, I'm excited. It's gonna be cool. Are you creating a new piece, or are you using an existing one? Mr. Gold wants me to make a new one specifically for this show, so I think I'm just gonna... - Cool. - ...like, do... - Well, what's the concept? - I don't know, um... I don't know yet. - Really? - Yeah. Isn't the show kind of soon? Yeah, I should probably get with that. I have to-- yes. I'm gonna do it. Sienna? Look, you're stronger than me. You always have been. When you really let somebody in, that's when you'll be happy. It's not that easy. Just give me a chance, please. What is it, Randy? Is everything okay at home? What does that have to do with the painting? More than you might know. I feel, um... broken, Redlocks. - Broken how? - I feel numb. I feel like the medication is, like, is taking my feelings away, and I'm not-- I'm not inspired and I have nothing to paint. Well, look, buddy, it's only meant to be temporary. I think I wanna stop taking the medication. The pharmacist says you can't just, you know, stop. I know, I wanna stop as soon as possible. Look, uh... let's just give it a little time, all right? Let your body adjust. Do you think Sienna likes me? Look, buddy, she definitely likes you, all right? But maybe not in the same way that you like her. How do you mean? Hey, we promised to always be honest with each other, right? - Yes. - Right? - Always honest. - Yeah, to a fault. All right, buddy, look. She's... out of your league. Now, hold on, some women can be very, very superficial, right? Now, they base attraction off a lot of unrealistic qualities and, uh... and attributes in guys. But you can love somebody, you know, without it being physical. Kind of like loving someone from afar. Just like you love Mom from afar? Was that an insult, Randy? - Are you insulted? - Yes. Then yes, it's an insult. Now, Randy, I, uh... I really sacrificed. I put any kind of dream I had on damn hold for you! For you. - I didn't ask you to. - I know. I know. I did it 'cause I love you. Not quite what I had in mind. Is there anything else you've done? No, that's my submission. Are you absolutely sure? That's it. That's the one I want, okay? Just use that, please. You know who Sweet Sienna is. Prepare this. I think you have more potential than you're realizing. Consider submitting something else, yes? I don't wanna consider anything. I want you to put her up on that wall now, okay? Sweet Sienna Hey, Randy. Omw to your place. R U home? I gotta go. Thanks. Oh, shit. Look, Randy... I know how you feel about me. When you kissed me out in the parking lot after the game, I could tell how much it meant to you. And I want you to know that it felt good for me, too. Well, that's good, right? - Yeah, it is. - Good. Look, it's not easy for me. I know feelings, they can be-- feelings can be hard. But there's something I've been wanting to tell you. No. No, please don't. - Don't. - Just stay right here. I have to go, Randy. Please, please. This-- you gotta stay. Look, Randy... Randy. I don't want to hurt you. - All right. - You're one of the sweetest, most honest, and the most real person I ever met. Thank you. Look... I'm going through something right now. I don't even know what it is yet. I need to clear my head and figure some things out. And when I do-- look at me. I want us to be friends, Randy. There's nothing that I want more than that. Do you understand what I mean by friends? Yeah. Yeah, friends, like a school-- school friends. - I know. Yeah. - I'm sorry. You're my sweet Sienna. Please don't make this harder than it already is. - I have to go. - But I-- but I love you. Sienna, I love you. You're supposed to say it back. You're supposed to say it back! Sienna!

He isn't here. My painting is supposed to be hanging right there, and it's not now. And I want to know why. Well, Maurizio didn't feel like it was your best work. - Who's he to judge? - It's his gallery. I think he's a liar. He said my painting was gonna be right there, and then he took it away. Well, he didn't take it away. He's just putting up one of mine instead. He's gonna hang one of your paintings? Oh, God, no. No, that would be a train wreck. He's putting up one of my photos. Why are you telling me this? I'm just being honest with you, man. I mean, look, it's not like you don't have skills. I guess you do. It's just that this wasn't your best work. Maurizio only wants to hang the best in his exhibits. This is why he's putting up one of my pieces. I think you're a liar, too. I think you wanted your piece in the show so bad that you told him that my art wasn't any good. You'll never be the artist that I am. I freaking hate you, Butch. Are we done?

I didn't realize I walked this far. Where are you going to? I don't know. - What? - I don't know. Is everything okay? Just having a really bad day. - What? - Just having a really bad day. Hold on. - Hi. - Hi. Can I join you? Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Do you think that something good can come from something bad? You mean like a blessing in disguise? I don't do well with most metaphors. We all have to let go of expectations in order to see things as they are. I've never felt this way before. It hurts on the inside. Before art school, I had this really stupid and lousy job. I had money, but I was miserable. I'm broke now, but I'm happier doing something that's important to me. What does that have to do with love? Everything. I had to let go of something that wasn't making me feel good anymore so I could allow an opportunity for something better to blossom. You know, something good from something bad. What if I'm not able to let it go? What inspires you, Randy? Feelings, emotions. I just paint so I can express what's hard to say. You wanna know what I'm feeling? - Yes. - I'm thinking how lucky anyone would be to know you. Whether you realize it or not, you have showed me that it's okay to be myself. Unapologetically. I think you're great. And I think you are exactly the way you need to be, Randy. Come.

Wait, you're gonna show my piece? Thisis a piece worth showing. - But what about Butch? - I may be the Italian Ice... but this, 24 karat. So we're both gonna get to show, then? Yes. You, go, hurry up before I change my mind. Thank you, Mr. Gold. Thank you. ARTPROV GALLERY You came. I wanted to show my support, you know? Even if it's just in spirit. You're not thinking about going in, are you? No. I think that guy's seen enough of me for a lifetime. You look beautiful. Do you wanna go for a walk? CONGRATS! Very proud of you, Randy. Picasso ain't got nothing on you! Security Guard Bob Ah, danke schoen. Mr. Whitsey, this is your night. Enjoy yourself. - I am very proud of you, Randy. - Thank you. It's grape juice in case the snobs think you're weird. - But I am weird. - Aren't we all? - I'll have some wine. - Waiter. I'm very proud of you. Salute. I'll be right back. You made it. - I wouldn't miss it. - You look really nice, Cassie. Thank you. You look nice, too. It's a really great turnout. It's not-- it's not all for me. Oh. Oh, you're the only reason that I came. - Do you wanna show me around? - Yeah. Come on. Okay. Lest they forget from whence they came. Hey, baby brother. Redlocks. You made it. I did. Come here. What's up? I really missed you, Mom. Mom, Henry, Cassie, I want to show you my painting. It's calledAn Apology. - A metaphor? - Yes, a metaphor. Did you paint that? Yeah, Mom, I did.
