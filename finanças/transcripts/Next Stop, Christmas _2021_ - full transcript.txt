This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Hello, party people. Oh. Ernie, watch the drape. -All right. I'll take those lab sponges in five, Dr. Navarro. I'm on it. -How's the patient, Ernie? Visions of sugarplums. All right, well, a week till Christmas, that seems appropriate. Who's playing DJ today? 'Tis the season, Dr. Reynolds. I thought I was get us all in the Christmas spirit. Well, it is the season for miracles. Good to go. Okay. Calling all elves. It's showtime. Great work in there, Doc. Never seen it done better. Thanks, Ernie. Merry Christmas. -Yeah, you too. Good work. Thanks. There you are. Hey, Mom. -Hi, honey. We've had quite an afternoon, your nephew and I. It was gingerbread house day. -Mm-hmm. Whoa, cutting it close this year, huh? Henrik? Come show her. -Hey, Aunt Angie. Take a look. Hey, buddy. Whoa, sweet! You know what that would go for in today's market? I think he should be an architect. We all flew in yesterday. So are you coming home, or is it work again this year? Um, hey, how's the adoption going? We still don't know yet. Without a good attorney, it's been a nightmare these past months. Kristen, why didn't you tell me that you were going through that? Maybe if you called once in a while. That is not fair. You know how much I'm working at the hospital right now. Look, there was... I wish there was a way that I could help you, and I wish I could be there with you guys this year. Honey, this is the second year in a row that you haven't come home for Christmas. Hey, Mom, I...I know. but you know how complicated things are to get away from work. -No, I don't. But family is very important. I know that, Mom. -Do you? Do you really, honey? Please. There is plenty of room, there's plenty of food. Aunt Myrt is having her annual holiday party. Bigger than even this time. I'm sorry. I'm on call this year. I can only get as far as my apartment. Please, even just for one day. Yes, if anything changes, you will be the first to know. Okay? Give my love to everyone. Love you, bye. Bye-bye! -Bye. Bye. -See you. Hey. Hey. -No hometown Christmas? I thought you cleared your calendar. No, Richardson has me on call, which is great, you know? I just want a quiet week in Yonkers alone. Alone? When you could be home. Yeah, but it's not the same. Mom's still dealing with the divorce, and it's so heartbreaking watching her go through it. It's been a while, hasn't it? -It has. Dad's in Arizona, you know, starting a new life. My sister and I, we're not on the same wavelength. It's hard. I get it. Families are complicated. Do you at least have time for a drink before you head home? A toast to the holidays? Don't have to ask me twice. Oh, my gosh, that surgery today was... Thank you. Well, here's to a quiet Christmas, if that's what you really want. Please, Santa, it's all I've asked for. Did he get your list this year? Mm. Who's had time to think about it? I'll take my chances. Although, I wouldn't mind finding him under my tree. Tyler? -Tyler Grant. Sports commentator on TV. Since when do you like sports? Since never. But I love hearing him talk. Tyler loves his fans. -Wait, do you know him? Yeah, no, years ago. You know that catchphrase of his? "When you can't get enough sports, I've got more." I gave that to him. This, I gotta hear. Well, it was when I was interning at Mt. Sinai. Mm-hmm. And I guess he'd playing hockey. Came in with a concussion, needed a doctor. I've seen that movie. Sandra Bullock and somebody. Right? Yeah, we dated for a few months. And then he asked to meet my parents one Christmas. And? -And I didn't realize it. But it was so he could get their blessing and propose. Tell me you said yes. -Nope, don't think so. So what? He never popped the question? Oh, no, he did. I turned him down. You what? -I know. You're the one who needed the doctor. I mean, look at the guy. Gosh, you know, that was, like, the last really good Christmas. Before everything changed. My mom and dad were still together, and my sister and I were inseparable. It was great. We were like a real, bonded family. Mm. That's so sweet. Okay, but back to Mr. Sports. Why did you say no? I don't know, the timing wasn't right. I was in med school, and he was breaking into network news. We took a break for a while, and then we just decided the moment had passed. Huh. We'll see about that. -What are you doing? I'm checking his status. Maybe there's still time for you to find him and plead temporary insanity. Okay, you're in luck. He's not married. But he's in a "serious relationship." Look. Oh, they're still together. That's nice. You knew about this? Well, whoever she is, she's not nearly good enough for him. Sabrina. She speaks five languages, has two master's degrees, and a book in the top ten last year. I think she's doing just fine. I mean, I'm...I'm just guessing. -Hmm. So you have been keeping tabs. -I don't have to! He's everywhere. He's hosting the World Series, the Bowl games, cohosting the next Olympics. He's stalking me. What if he's still in love with you? That was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. I can't turn back time. He even got a new puppy. Look at this guy. -What? Okay, Tyler did not even like dogs before he met mine. Oh, Boomer. I miss that dog. Angie? Ben! -Hey! Hi! What are you doing here? Oh, my firm's just up the street. What? I thought you were in Boston. No, my company moved me to Manhattan. Yeah, last summer. Wait, last summer? You've been here all this time? Yes. You know, I've been meaning to give you a call. Hi. I'm Sabrina. I'm introducing myself because as soon as you showed up, she forgot I existed. Sorry, I'm just surprised to see you is all. Yeah. Ben Lee. Angie and I grew up together. -Yeah. both: We were practically family. Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah. I heard that your sister is having some trouble adopting. Something about the bio dad's parents or... Oh, yeah. I don't know. You know more than I do. Wait, I...corporate law? I thought... I thought family law is what you always wanted to do. Yeah, that's true. I wish I had. But, you know, I mean, the money's good, so... Well... So you're a corporate attorney. I work with Angie at the hospital. Neurosurgery. Oh. I'm impressed. That's why I said it. Um, well, hey, I'm here with some friends from work, and it's very casual, so can I buy you ladies a drink? Oh, I wish. I have to go if I'm gonna make the 10:15. But I'd love to, if that's okay. Sure. Yeah, please. Well... -It was good to see you. Yeah. Yeah, good to see you. Uh, Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, Ben. See you. -Bye, sweetie. Hey, you! You! -Me? Yeah, you. Oh, thank you. I need a ticket to Yonkers. The machine line is so long, and my phone app isn't working, so... Phones these days. Tricky things. I like the old days when phones just made calls. Uh-huh. So I'm trying to make the 10:15. Ah, the last express to Yonkers. Yeah. Right. So if... if you could just help me out. Here you go. Thank you. That's what I'm here for. To help you out. Oh. Headed home for the holidays? Uh, no, just a quiet one by myself. It's what I want. Funny thing. Sometimes what we want is not what we need. But they say the magic of Christmas will find you wherever you are. They say that? Okay. -The 10:15. Yep. Oh, gosh. I don't... can I make that? You still have plenty of time. Well, I... Huh, that's so weird. I could swear... Please, don't. Not this close to Christmas. People are in such a hurry lately. Running here, rushing there. Don't they know that this is a time to slow things down, appreciate the world around you? Here you go. -Oh, wow, that's very fancy. Oh, this is a round-trip. I just needed the one-way. No charge. Merry Christmas. Okay. Enjoy your trip. He really is everywhere. Hi. -Ticket, please. Yeah. Here you go. -What's this? Some sort of holiday promotion, I think. You'd think the main office would tell us these things. Here you go. Merry Christmas. What the... Did you miss me? -Ahh! Oh! Ow! Okay! Remind me to never do that again. Tyler Grant? The donuts you asked for from the breakfast car? Santa's Specials? Didn't expect me back so soon, I guess? Tyler? Come on, I wasn't gone that long. I'm so sorry. What is this? Well, this is breakfast, although I imagine your parents have a more elaborate plan for that, given all you've told me about them. Something about your dad's French toast? My dad's in Arizona. -Mm, I don't think so. We called him this morning when we were leaving Manhattan. Like, you and me, "we"? -Like, you and me, "we." What was that for? -Wow. That kiss felt incredibly real. Yeah, well, I should hope so. -Wait, wait, wait. Sorry, um... Just give a minute... a second. Oh, gosh. Don't move. Just stay right there. I will be right back, I think. I don't know. All right, but I can't promise that both of these donuts will be here when you get back. Oh, my God, I'm losing it. You. You! What are you doing here? Having a cup of cocoa. But you're the one who sold me the ticket. Oh, I think I'd remember that. No, it's the uniforms. We all look the same in these. Well, then you have a twin. Must be a handsome fella. Okay, well, whoever you are, I'm not where I was. I'm not-I'm not where I'm supposed to be, I mean. I mean, this isn't the train that I got on. This one is old. I didn't even know these things were running still. Besides, and there's a guy in the next car that I haven't seen in ten years. Is he bothering you? -Well, no. Yes, uh... no. But he's supposed to be on TV. And he has donuts. That's not a crime. Santa's Specials. Psst! It's Christmas. I haven't had one of those in like... Ten years? -Yes. Exactly. When Tyler bought them for me on a train ride home in 2011! Wait a second, how did you know that? This isn't my phone. No? -No, but it has a signal. Oh, gosh. Hi, it's Dr. Reynolds. Who? -Angie Reynolds, neurology. Sure you have the right number? Yes, I have the right number. Can I speak with Dr. Navarro, please? Can you spell that for me, please? N-A-V-A... -I've never heard of her. Yes... what do you mean you've heard of her? Is she from this hospital? -Yes, from this hospital. Hello? Oh. Whoa, would you look at the time? Next stop, Shepard's Ferry. My... my hometown? We're in Connecticut? You might want to gather your things and find a seat. No, no, no, no. I don't want to find a seat. I want to go home. I want to go back to New York City. Oh, well, you need a return ticket for that. Oh, well, as it happens, you sold me one. Well, I guess it wasn't you. It was some... your twin. Anyway. Well, something seems to be missing. Missing? -No return. Can't get home without it. I can't? -Mm-mm. Sorry about the donuts. Can't say I didn't warn you, though. Wait, we're slowing down. Yeah, it's easier to get off the train that way. Shepard's Ferry, next stop. Shepard's Ferry, next stop. You'll never get home if you miss this stop. Shepard's Ferry. Oh, cute town, just like you said. Love that Christmas tree. Yeah, we used to spend every Christmas Eve there for the lighting of the star. It was a family tradition. But they built a mini-mall there years ago. Apparently not. -Yes, they did. There hasn't been a tree there since 2011. So this year? Are you okay? -I'm not sure. Of anything. Okay, well, I'm gonna get our coats. Oh. Be right back. What in the world is happening? Christmas, of course. Enjoy it while it lasts. Angie. -Dad? Angie. Hey, sweetheart. So good to see you, sweetheart. -Oh, my. What'd I do to deserve such a big hug? You're home! -Of course I'm home. You saw me here three weeks ago for my birthday. Where else would I go? -Arizona? All that heat? No, thank you. You okay, babe? Oh, I just missed you so much. Hey. Tyler Grant, sir. The famous TV sports reporter we've heard so much about. Only local so far, but I'm doing my best, Mr. Reynolds. It's nice to meet you, son. Please, call me George. You got it. -You sure you're okay? It's the holidays. This one's a softie. Don't I know it? Think we should call ahead and warn her mom or what? Dad. All right, guys, well, car's right over here. You ready? -Yeah. Hey, did I hear you were at the World Series this year? Oh, yeah, for the St. Louis win. Locker room celebration and everything. You know, if they send me next year, you should join me. This one's a keeper, Angie. I couldn't dream up anyone better. Get your stuff upstairs. You guys, just make yourselves at home. Wow. Angie told me you had the perfect Christmas house. Everything but the tree. Saving that for you two. Do have some broken lights on these strings, though. Maybe you can help me fix them later, we can talk some football? -Yeah. You happy to be home? -You have no idea. Henrik! No running in the house! Peter! -It's Christmas. Let them go. Oh, wait. Honey! Hi, sis. -Hi. Welcome home. -Oh. He found the dog before I could wrap it. You must be the boyfriend. If I'm not, this is gonna be a very awkward visit. Tyler, this is my sister, Kristen, and her husband, Peter. And that blur was Henrik back when he was four. Back when he was four? Mom. Look at you! Oh, no, no, no. -Oh, my God. Don't. I have been baking gingerbread for tomorrow. Gingerbread house day. Oh, made the whole house smell like Christmas. We did it every year. Uh, you make it sound like ancient history. Mom, this is Tyler. Tyler, this is my mom. Mrs. Reynolds. Call me Evelyn or there's a good chance I will not answer you. All right, then, Evelyn. Boomer! Oh, Boomer. You're alive. These two were inseparable till she went to med school. But now he's all mine. -What... what is he, a bulldog? A rescue, the best kind. Hey, fella. You know, I'm not much of a dog person. But this guy's terrific. Maybe you'll get your own one day. Now we just gotta get you two settled in, and your mom's come up with a little list for us. We've got tree shopping, Santa, of course, and then the big town Christmas Eve sing-along. A town tradition, where they light the Christmas star on the tree in front of the train station. Oh, I've heard. Never a dull moment come December. And Aunt Myrt's party. Bigger than ever, she says. But then... all: She always says that! Myrtle Conway, no relation, but everyone in town calls her Aunt Myrt. You'll love her. We still have your room upstairs. So hururry up and get ready. We've got lots to do. Your family's great. -Say that in a few days. I bet I will. -Yeah. I bet you will too. Hey, if we're going tree shopping, I need to change. Right. Second door on the left. And I'll meet you downstairs. Yeah. 'Cause... cool. -Tyler Grant. Yeah. Whoa. Everything okay? I thought she changed this to a crafts room for her pottery. Since when has mom been into pottery? I just meant I thought she maybe found another use for it, that's all. Never. She has this idea that you'll become a successful doctor and still find a way to move back in. How? All my patients are in Manhattan... Will. Will. Will be in Manhattan. I imagine. How's Peter? He looks great. And Henrik? Oh, my gosh. Growing like a weed since you last saw him. Of course that's been a while. So tell me about Tyler. Oh, well, he's all about sports, 24-7. I mean, he's cohosting the next Olympics. Sometime in the future, I would imagine. Is it love? -I mean, he's very handsome. Kind, funny, on the brink of a major career. What the heck was I thinking? You have doubts? Yeah, but for the life of me, I cannot think why. When he proposes this time... Ignore me. I don't know what I'm saying. Clearly. Kristen, this is going to be the best Christmas. If I could pick one from all the holidays we've spent, I pick this one. You just got here. -Yeah, but I can feel it. Can't you? Everything's perfect. Everyone's happy. Sure. Just the way that it was supposed to be. Anyway, first thing on Mom's list is that tree. "Not till Angie gets here." Henrik's so excited. Yeah. Let me just change real quick, and I'll be right down. Okay, keep it together, Angie. Oh, my God, you could wake up at any minute now. So enjoy it. Where have I seen this before? Smile, everybody. Look like you're having a good time. We are having a good time, Peter. Hey, is that a new tablet? Early Christmas gift from Kristen. So we can capture every moment. And he means every moment! It's okay to put that down every now and then, honey. All right, everyone, I want us to find the perfect tree, so I think we should split up and cover more territory. I'll head over this way. Honey, you want me to go with you? I mean, we're supposed to do this together, right? Yeah. No, no, I think it's best if we make this a solo mission. Your father is so stubborn. He has to find the perfect tree. They all look the same once they have the ornaments on them, right? I agree. -I better go with him, otherwise we'll be here till New Year's Eve. Look! Look! it's Santa's Workshop! Can you take me? Yeah. Is that okay, you guys? Of course. -Feel free. We've already seen three of Santa's other helpers this season. -Lovely for you. If it isn't my old friend, Henrik! Santa! You come to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? I want a baby brother. Or a sister, if that's all you got. That is a... a tall order on short notice. How about a race car? How about... how about that? I'd rather have a baby brother. Oh, well, um, Santa will see what he can do. But in the meantime, how about a candy cane? Thank you! -Yes, of course. Awesome. Thank you. Aww, not so fast, you two. Who's next? Oh, we're just here for Henrik. Oh, no, no, no. I think someone else might need some of your attention here, Santa. Tyler, would you stop? Tyler! -Oh, yes. Well, young lady, what would you like for Christmas? Ben? Oh, did you say you want Ben for Christmas? That's right, you were Santa that year... this year. Don't blow my cover. You're gonna make the kids cry again! Sorry. Anyway, what would you like in your stocking? Well, I already got a Christmas gift this year, and it's a real doozy, let me tell you. Could you maybe put in a good word for me, Santa? Tyler, this is Ben. Ben, this is Tyler. Oh, um, you know, I'll have to check. He might be on Santa's naughty list. But you, you get a candy cane. Thank you. -Thank you. Here. Come see! Come see! Excuse me, sir. -Beg your pardon. Hey. -There we go. Ah. What do you think? -All right. See this, Tyler? This is what I'm talking about. Looks great. Pretty good. -Hey. What's the deal with Angie and, uh, Santa back there? Ben? Friend of the family. They grew up together. -Oh. And was Angie's first kiss, I hear? He's coming over later to help decorate. Great. -So this is the one that I was thinking about. I don't know if you have thoughts that you want to share. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh! Angie! Chloe! -Oh, hi! Hi. -Merry Christmas, everyone! Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Oh, this is Chloe. This is Aunt Myrt's granddaughter. Hi! I'm so surprised to see you here. I...yeah, with such handsome company. This is Tyler Grant. And you know everyone else. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you too! Oh, were you guys looking at this tree too? Oh, yeah. -Oh, no. I mean, if you want to take it, you can take it. No. No, no, no. It's fine. Honestly, it's for Aunt Myrt's party, and it might not be big enough. You know how she is. Anyway, but Ben is here. And he's keeping an eye out for the best tree, so I'm just gonna let him handle it when he's done playing Santa. You guys can have this tree. Just have it. It's really a beautiful one. And blah! I'll see you later. Merry Christmas! Bye! All right, Tyler, my boy, let's wrap this up. Bring her home. Hey. What do you think? Should this be an earring? Earring? It's so nice and shiny. -Look, it's a necklace. Word is you and Santa over there had a thing back when. What? Oh, Ben? No. No thing. Something about a first kiss? -Oh. Yeah, we were 11. It was a lot more tooth than lip. Guy seems like he's part of the family. Yeah. Well, his... his grandmother raised him, so my parents were like his parents. Tyler, you're not jealous, are you? Me? Come on! No. No way. All right, everybody, let's see what we got. Let's count down. all: Three... two... one! Now all it needs is the ornaments. Henrik, you get to hang the first one. Good job, boys. -Okay, where's this guy going? Right... yeah. Yeah. Perfect. Yep. Nice work. I see you're a very good boy, so you'll get your fire engine. You see? I told you he'd get me one. Mm-hmm. Yes, dear. Well, look, you wait right over there. Mommy wants to thank Santa too. What do you mean by saying a thing like that? Hey, Dad. There's plenty of room on the couch over here next to Mom. Oh, it's okay. I'm comfortable right here. Are you sure, you know? You two always liked to... Leave him be, Angie. I've got Boomer to keep me warm, don't I, boy? I'm good too. I've got my magazine. What? Was that it? Having a good holiday? I'm so sorry. I don't understand what's happening. You don't need to understand it. You need to appreciate it. Oh, I do. I appreciate it so much. But this ends now, right? I mean, we both know this Christmas can't last forever. Am I right? You want to go back to New York. Yes, I do. -What's the hurry? Uh, well, for one thing, it's 2011 here, and there's no way I'm going back to medical school. So if we could just turn this train around, that would be great. Whatever you say! Oh. Ticket, please. -Yeah! It's still blank. Nothing I can do without that ticket. Rules of the rails. So what do I do? -You need to put things right. Before Christmas Eve, I'd imagine. That's the way these things usually work out. Ticking clock and all. Or what? Or what? I'm stuck here forever? Okay, I have to put something right. Tyler's proposal! Wait, am I supposed to say yes this time? 'Cause, you know, last time I said no, which just felt right, given where we were in our lives, but now I don't know. Is that it? That's it. Shepard's Ferry! Next stop. Shepard's... Okay, so I'm gonna do that. Ferry. Wait a sec... There you go, buddy. Oh! My... Where did you come from? The sun's barely up. What are you doing here? If I knew, I would tell you, honestly. Friend of yours? Oh, yeah, back from the repair shop. Freak walnut-cracking accident. You do not want to know. I'll take your word for it. And I'm here because I promised Aunt Myrt a tree impressive enough for a party. Uh-huh. -Nothing yet. But there's another shipment coming, so we'll see. Is there something on your mind? Oh, so much. Okay, well, if you need a friendly ear, we got time. It's gonna sound absolutely crazy. Totally insane. Maybe that's what's happening. I've lost my mind. Okay, now you have my attention. You know what? We're not even close anymore, because you moved from Boston to Manhattan, and you didn't even call me. -What? Ugh, but I have to tell somebody. I have to tell somebody, because... wait a second. The train dropped me off here. Maybe that's a sign. I'm supposed to tell you! Angie, you can tell me anything! Remember when you parked the principal's motorcycle in his office? How did you do that anyway? The car club did it. It was just my idea to take the handlebars off and then roll it in and put it back together in there. That is genius. -I know. So great. My point is, who didn't turn you into school police? Huh? This guy. Also, who didn't rat you out when you skipped class to go see "Spider-Man"? That's because you came with me. Right. That's true. Well, 'cause we had the same taste in movies. Yeah. And music. And ice cream. Yep. Oh, well, except for your weird sprinkle obsession. I will never understand that... -What's your point? Don't talk about sprinkles. My... my point is you can trust me. So whatever you want to say, just blurt it out. I'm from the future! And you're here to terminate me? Ben, be serious. -What? You started it! Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth. It's totally true! I am from the future! And that's, like, a metaphor for... No, Ben, stay with me! Okay, I got on a train to Yonkers last night, and the year was 2021. Instead of Yonkers, it dropped me off here and now. Okay, I don't... I mean... This was a mistake. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, hold on. Tell me again. Slowly. And over food. You always think about food! -Well, are you not hungry? Morning. -Hey, Tyler. How'd you sleep? Oh, just fine. Boomer keeps following me around everywhere. He likes you. French toast? -I hear it's world-famous. Sure, yeah, hook me up. Haven't seen Angie yet. She's up and out already this morning. Always the early bird. Actually, that gives me a chance to ask you something. Oh, yeah? About me and your daughter. And what might that be? Okay. Wait. Hold on. Can we go back to the part where I'm the incredibly successful corporate lawyer in New York? I thought I was gonna go into family law. I know, but somewhere along the way, that changes, and I don't know how. That's all I ever wanted to do! You know how important family is to me. I can't imagine changing my mind about that. Ben, I know how this sounds. God, I wish...I wish there was a way I could prove it. I mean... Show me your driver's license. Is it a holograph? Are you about to pop up in 3D, like Princess Leia? Come on, say, "Help me, Ben Lee." You're enjoying this, aren't you? It's ten years, Ben, not ten-hundred. And no, I don't have it, because when I woke up here, everything was as it was. Like, look at this phone. I mean, it's practically an antique. An antique? That's the latest model. That's newer than mine. Oh, wait. Yeah. Okay, there probably are a couple upgrades. Yeah. They get bigger. -That doesn't... oh, thank you. Thanks. -Well, let's get some food. Ooh, tell me what I'm gonna order. Ben, I don't remember everything. Do you remember what you had for breakfast ten years ago? Pancakes, bacon, orange juice. Okay. It's 'cause I have that every morning. Oh, geez. The old you used to love that about me. Ooh, the New York Giants win the Super Bowl. No! -Yep. No! Against Brady and the Pats? No! They're undefeated. No. But it's not pretty. Trust me. Oh, so I'm supposed to wait around until then to see if you're right? Okay. We make gingerbread houses tonight. Yep. Your mom invited me over. But I knew that. Well, she always invites me over. That's no mystery. Wait a second. You choke on a gumdrop today, and I save your life. Well, I would hope so. You're in med school. That's, like, the job. Ben, it's not that I save your life, it's that I know that you choke. Oh, okay! Wait, well, what if I don't now that you told me? You will. -Or will I? Yeah. -You sure? Yeah. -I don't know. I think I have the power to change the future. Use it wisely. I put a lot of work into it, but, you know, I finally sent in my audition tape, and now I wait. It's national news, so even an interview would be amazing. I don't understand any of that, but I would certainly hire you if I had a network. Maybe you'll get one for Christmas, Mom. It's never too late. -Perhaps. Eventually I'm gonna need a catchphrase, you know, something memorable, like... "When you can't get enough sports, I've got more." Hey, that's good. No. It's close. But... Why don't you think about it? It might grow on you. Hey, where's Dad? I don't know. He's around here somewhere. He's probably shoveling the sidewalk or cleaning the attic of something. He needs his alone time right now. And missing this? That's not like him. Your father's his own man. Don't ask me to explain him. Hey. Does anyone want gumdrops? Gumdrop, anyone? They are delicious. No, we're good. Why don't you have one? Oh, maybe I will. No. No? -Or yes. No. Maybe later. What is up with you two? -That's just Ben being Ben. He thinks he's funny. You always thought I was funny. The senior play? I can still hear you laughing. That's because your pants fell down during your big speech. Who knew George Washington had SpongeBob boxers? Okay. Okay. It was laundry day. Honestly, you guys, they've been like this forever. Yeah, please ignore him. Yes. -Hey, how's it going, Henrik? Good. -Yeah? He's a one-kid construction crew. Imagine what he could accomplish with a brother or sister. We all heard him ask Santa. Hey, bud, how about a candy cane fence? Ben, are you okay? I think he's choking. -What are you choking on, Ben? What do we do? Hit him on the back? He's definitely choking. -What do we do? The gumdrops. It's the gumdrops. Oh, is it the gumdrops? What do... we hit him on the back. He can't breathe. -Hit him on the back? No. I think you have to... -Angie, Angie. He can't breathe. -Are you choking? Thank you. That's a relief. Who could have seen that coming? Right? It's like you'd have to be from the future. Gross. I told you! -Okay. So you have until Christmas day, or what, you're stuck here? Well, he said Christmas Eve, but I think all I have to do to fix it is say yes tonight. Say yes to what? To Tyler's proposal. Last time I said no. Wait, wait, you're saying... -Oh, you don't know that yet. You're gonna marry Tyler? I mean, are you sure that's what you want? What, is that such a wild idea? Well, I kind of thought that... What? What'd you think? I thought that... -Oh, oh, you and me. Oh, Ben. If everyone who loved Coldplay and lasagna wound up together... Besides, we tried dating. Well, you didn't really take it seriously. Are you joking me? You didn't take it seriously! Plus, we're friends now, Ben, and that feels right. Right? Now that works for us, right, Ben? If you're worried, don't be. -Oh. I...oh. Not worried. Okay. But if you are. Sorry. Tyler Grant. Hey! Yeah, I've been hoping to hear from you. So you think the entire Christmas universe arranged all of this... -Mm-hmm. So you can come back and marry Tyler? Well, nothing else makes sense! And you think that makes sense? Yes! Tonight, he took me to Donovan. Well, no, sorry, he takes me to Donovan... you know what I mean. -Yeah. Expensive. I'm impressed. Or, like, I will be impressed. Or I have... bugh. Bugh! Now you have me doing it. So he's gonna take me there, and he puts a ring in my champagne glass. Cliché. But... sorry. I think it's sweet. So I'm gonna say yes, and then I think everything should just go back to normal. Sure. As if anything with you is ever normal. You see, this is why we never worked out. Whew. So how was your meal? I mean, amazing. All seven courses. Gosh, I forgot how good the food was here. Have you been here before? No, I just mean from the reviews. You know what, I can honestly say I've only ever been here with you. Good. Because I want tonight to be special. Oh? I told you there was a reason for this dinner tonight. A surprise. Oh? I wonder what it could be. Thank you. No, but seriously, what is it, 'cause this is just champagne. Yeah. To celebrate... My new job! Your what? Angie, they called me this afternoon, while you were out in the snow with Santa. They loved my audition tapes. My interviews. My catchphrase. Well, your catchphrase. Yeah, no, I'm sure they did. You'll develop a whole show around it someday in the future. I'm going from local to national. I mean, can you believe that? -I cannot. I'm very happy for you, Tyler. That's wonderful. There's only one catch. I do have to go to the city first thing tomorrow to seal the deal. Wait, you're leaving? -Just for the day. But what a reason to celebrate, right? I mean, bet you didn't see that one coming tonight, huh? I did not. At all. Ooh, that's good. Hey, honey. Tyler's packing upstairs. Is everything okay? Yeah, he got that job. The promotion that he wanted? He's gotta go sign contracts. But he'll be back for Aunt Myrt's party. He wouldn't want to miss that! And the sing-along. And the lighting of the star. Did you two have a nice time tonight? It wasn't exactly what I expected, but yeah, it was nice. I need your finger. Oh. Good. Your sister just put Henrik to bed. That boy has so much energy. If there were two of them... She's not... she can't be... -No. Right. Yeah. They've been trying for a long time. In vitro. She didn't tell you? No. Well, between you and me, it's not going so well. I'm sure she's just trying to find the right time to tell you. -Yeah. How about you, Mom? Everything okay with you and Dad? Why do you ask? I don't know, he's very distant this year. He's always off doing something. Yeah. That's just him right now. You know, we'll be fine. The season brings up a lot of things in people. Look at that. Dreams we have when we're young just sometimes don't turn out the way we'd hoped. That's the dress in my closet. Yeah, I put some of my old things in there. I hope you don't mind. You look the same, Mom. Wouldn't it be nice if something things stayed the same? I love you, Mom. Love you. Where's Henrik? -He's out like a light. Oh. I spoke to the doctor. You're only telling me this now? He called right before dinner. This is the first chance we've had to talk. Okay, and? The two remaining embryos didn't make it to day five. And those were all we had. So that's it? He wants us to come in after the holidays to discuss next steps. Peter, it feels like the end of the road. It's not the end. Not necessarily. It was so easy with Henrik. Why is it so hard now? You heard. Did not mean to eavesdrop. Kristen, I'm so sorry. So are we. -I could have helped! I'm a doctor at a major Manhattan hospital with connections and relationships. You're only a med student. Right, my point is, why didn't you tell me what you were going through? We've never had that kind of relationship. The sister thing. Where we do each other's hair, talk about boys, heartaches, all that. But that's not us? Come on, Angie, you've never taken the time to ask about my life. It's always been about yours, which, I admit, is more interesting. Wow. That's really how you see me? I mean, if I was busy during med school and interning... There's a disconnect. Like with Tyler. If it hadn't been for Mom, I wouldn't have known till you showed up with him. Right. Is he the one, you think? He was gonna propose tonight. At least I thought he was. But he didn't? -No, he didn't. Anyway, no, we're talking about you. I am gonna try really hard, promise, to be a better sister. Maybe it's because of Ben, why he didn't propose. He sees how you two are with each other. You think Tyler's jealous? -It's pretty obvious. Ben's good-looking, funny, single. Eh, he's fine. -You've been friends forever. It wouldn't be a problem if he had a girlfriend. But he doesn't. But he could. Okay, hopefully this tree will do. Ooh, it's absolutely perfect! -Ben, you remember Chloe Of course! Hi. Hey. So I hear we're dating. That is what Angie tells me. If that's okay with you. -Oh, absolutely. Now I have a cute date for the Christmas party, plus Angie said I could stay in her at the moment for a week while she's away for the summer. So honestly, a couple of days pretending is totally worth it for me. -Okay. Sorry, I know this is really strange, you guys, but it's really gonna help me out a lot. Yeah. Are you sure that the reason Tyler didn't propose the other night is me? Yeah. It's crazy, right? I mean, I think he's just... you know, we've always been friends. We'll always be friends. Till you move to Manhattan and you don't call me for six months. I would never do that! -But you do. Anyway, I think that if you had a girlfriend he'd be less threatened. Enter... Chloe! Okay, so I'm feeling like, for the Christmas party, we could do a little matchy-matchy cute little color coordination, and then for New Year's Eve... Okay. -Maybe we could go metallic. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. No, sorry. I kind of thought this was, like, only for the week? Oh, we'll see about that. Uh... -Oh. What? Show me where this goes. Okay. Right this way, boyfriend. Can I call you that? Should I just stick with Ben? Benny? Ben's fine. Benji! Ah, good thing I took that improv class last semester! Right? You are getting a kick out of this, aren't you? So very much. I can't carry this by myself! Ooh. -All right. Okay, I'm gonna let you... Oh, this looks like an important one. Front and center. -Up, like, here? Yeah. I didn't even know they were dating. Oh, it's a... it's a new thing. I don't think it's serious, Aunt Myrt. Oh. Funny. I always thought you and Ben would wind up together. You too. Maybe I need to get us T-shirts that say "just friends." The very best relationships start out that way. My late husband was my best friend before we were married. What's in this guy? Oh, be careful with that box. Those ornaments are from my honeymoon in Austria. Absolutely irreplaceable. Okay. I didn't... kid gloves, Aunt Myrt. Oh, you're kidding, right? She's kidding, right? Gosh, Mom really needs all this stuff? I know. We could probably gift-wrap the whole town, couldn't we? Yeah, seriously. You know your mom. She loves this stuff. Better too much than not enough. But I thought she was gonna come with us so that we could go to lunch after. We tend to split up the errands these days. Well, yeah, I noticed. What's up with that? You two were connected at the hip all the time. You know, Ang, when you been together as long as your mother and I have, things change. Small stuff starts to matter. She likes romantic comedies, I like mysteries. I like going out, she likes staying in. It's to be expected. So you bend, bargain, you adjust. Did think things would be a little different, though, once you two kids left the house. Get back to being just us again. Nothing for you to worry about, though. Boop! Are you sure, Dad? You know what, I think I left my wallet at the store. I'll be right back, honey. How did I not see this before? Hey, there. God, you have got to stop doing that. What's going on with your ticket? Ugh. -Still no? Please, you have to help me. Look, I admit, it was wonderful at first, a Christmas miracle. But nothing's what I remember. I mean, Kristen and I aren't close, and Mom and Dad, they're drifting apart, and Tyler hasn't proposed, Ben is being Ben. Please, you have to help me! Well, I'm so sorry, but it's not up to me. Well, will you look at that? Shepard's Ferry. Again? This is Christmastime. Give it a go. Tyler, I'm so glad you made it back in time for the White Elephant. I'm so happy to be back for it. Can someone explain how this works? Yeah, it's a White Elephant gift exchange. A Reynolds family tradition. -Yeah, we all bought gifts. Silly things, or something someone's given us, and we all open them in turn, and then... so, we can either keep what we got, or we can trade it with someone else. Right, until absolutely no one is happy with what they have. You'll get the hang of it. But until then, you guys have to eat some cookies, because I've been baking all day. Nobody bakes like you, Evelyn. Thank you. Here you go. -Oh, such a provider. Oh, isn't my boyfriend just the sweetest? Any day now he's probably gonna pop the question, right, sweetie? I'm learning that pretty much anything is possible. How about that? This is my contribution. Angie. Thank you, sis. Mm. Isn't it funny? -Oh, my gosh. Ben, it's the Frosty the Snowman jewelry box. I thought it was from Kristen. Oh, I found it in the attic when I was pulling down the ornaments. Sorry if... -Oh, no, no, it's...I mean, I gave that to Angie, like, way back when. How long ago? Well, here's a hint. Used to hold my candy jewelry. Is that all that's in there? -Yeah, just the bracelet. Why? Okay, who's next? We win. -We won. You know what? -All right. Almost beat you. Oh! You ladies picked a bad day for a snowball fight. The old flamethrower's feeling pretty good today. All right, well, we'll see about that. We will. This is your last chance to back out, ladies. Feel like there should be some penalty for trash-talking. Yeah. Hey, if it's all right with you guys, I'd like to throw the first pitch. Ooh, a sports reference. I love it. Here we go. Angie. What is this? Playing that hockey game was the best thing I ever did. You got a concussion. -Yeah, I did. And it brought me right to you. -Uh-huh. Ang, we make a great team. -Yeah? We're like the Miami Dolphins in '72. That great, huh? -That great! And I want us to go on forever, like the Patriots in '07. No, I get it. Me too! -So? Oh. So... so I think you're supposed to ask a question. Oh, yeah, right, of course. -It's happening! I spoke to your dad the other day. Aww. -He's cool with it. And? -And... Angie, will you marry me? Yes! Yes, I will! I thought you'd never ask! We're getting married! -Married! Oh, my God! All right, hey, drinks on me, you guys! Hey. Um, I just want to say all I want is for you to be happy. And if that's with Tyler or whoever, I am there for you. I mean, I'll always be there for you. Thanks, Ben. How's your ticket? No return date? I don't understand. Tyler proposed, but it's still blank. Maybe... -You guys, it's cold out here! Come on, let's go celebrate! These newfangled lights. Keep burning out faster than I can keep up with them. You sure you don't want me to do that for you? Yeah, I'm good. I'm an old hand at this. Hey, Mom. Should Dad be doing that? Have you tried talking to your father lately? I'm worried about you two. Angie, leave it alone. We're fine, or we will be. Let's talk about you. You just got engaged! No, don't change the subject! I'm serious. When did this start? I don't know. With you girls grown and gone, we... we had to talk to each other. And I guess, after all this time, we're discovering there isn't really that much more to say. Well, you'd never know it from this picture. You guys are so happy here. Where was this? Aunt Myrt's first Christmas party. It's where I met your father. How did I not know that? That's where you guys met? Was such a romantic evening. Myrt had hired these Victorian carolers, and your father was so handsome. It wasn't just that, it was the way he looked at me. That's cute. -Yeah. We danced by the light of the Christmas tree, all those colors. Wouldn't it be nice if we could turn back the clock and do it all over again? Yes. It would. Hey. Where's my father? -Oh, he's up there somewhere. Said he needed to check something on the other side of the house. Well, he's gonna break his neck one Christmas! Oh, wait, no, he's not. Thank goodness. Hey, you know who needs a break? We do. You know, this is all fun, but we need some alone time, you know? Just the two of us? Away from everything? Oh. I didn't want to bring this up in front of everyone, but... What's that? -Two tickets to Barcelona. Like, Spain, Barcelona? Say yes and we leave in the morning. But Aunt Myrt's party is tomorrow, and I have been traveling a lot. That's an annual thing, you said, right? So, you know, does it really matter if you miss one year? Let me explain. So this is, like, an important family thing. Okay. Let me see if I can change the tickets for the next day, if that works? We just have to be there on Christmas. There's this big soccer match. -In December? It's a charity thing, indoors. Teams from all over the world. The network asked me to cover it. And I said yes, if they would let me take you. Okay, so this is about work? No. No, no. This is about us. Yes, with some work tossed in, but this is a chance for us to celebrate our engagement. And for me to prove what I can do. Look, Angie, when we're married, this is something we're gonna have to do a lot. You know, I'm gonna have to cover the stories wherever they take me. Right. -And I want you with me. What about my career? Yeah, yeah, of course, there's your career, but, you know, we'll make it work. Compromise is both ways. So? Huh? What do you say? Um... Hey, guys! Somebody grab that ladder for me? Yep! Yes, sir. Absolutely. Yep. Yes, sir, we are flying out tomorrow, on Christmas Eve, and I've got the whole crew standing by in Barcelona right now. He's very good-looking, your fiancé. But is he always so busy? Yeah, work is his passion. Ah. And where do you fit in? I know how it looks, Aunt Myrt, but you know I'm gonna be just as busy at the hosp...I mean, in medical... medical school. So, you know, we'll both be busy. And yet, knowing you, you will always find the time for personal life, yes? Life is more than work. Yeah, it should be. -But does he feel that way? I am so sorry about that. -No problem. Angie's been telling me all that you've been up to. Oh, yeah. Well, there's this... there's a showcase for the top European soccer leagues. Premier League in England, of course, Germany's Bundesliga, La Liga in Spain. Oh. We've got teams from Italy and from France. And there I go again. So where were we? You were about to tell me why we're meeting. Yes. I still have so many gifts to wrap and so much to get done before the party tonight. Or, rather, my staff does. Well, from what I understand, my parents actually met at your very first Christmas party. Yes. Oh, what a story that was. I think it was fate. You know how some people just naturally belong together, and some people... No, I'm just gonna ignore this. Sorry. Some people, you have to kind of make it work, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, there it goes again. You know what, I just...I'm just gonna very quickly... I'm so...I'm so sorry. Tyler Grant. Yes. Um, I wanted to give them that night again as a Christmas present, just, like, recreate it as closely as I can. Oh, what a lovely idea! How can I help? Well, I made a list of all the songs that Mom remembers. By the way, Mom and Dad have no idea that I'm doing this. And I was hoping you could get those Victorian carolers that Mom loved so much? After 30 years? I'll see what I can do. But they were not young when your parents met. They're filing for Medicare now. Oh, gosh. Is there a reason for this? I think they could use a reminder. Of what's special about Christmas? What's special about their relationship. Angie, you are a wonderful girl. Thanks, Aunt Myrt. Older than your years. What do you mean? There's something different about you this holiday. Oh, yeah? I can't quite put my finger on it, but... it's a confidence. It's probably the cake. Tyler, you're such a dear for carrying those to the car for me. It's no problem at all. -Good. Good. Here's the keys. Oh, thank you. It's the white one right down there. Got it. -And if you wouldn't mind? Thank you so much. -Oh, not at all. It's no problem. Okay. Thank you so much for doing this, Aunt Myrt. Oh, Aunt Myrt. Oh, my God, I love that so much. I always have. You know, family means everything. Even if it's this town. The family you choose, right? -Yeah. See you tonight. -Yeah, okay, tonight. Hey. Hey. -You going to lunch? I'm getting sandwiches for the elves. Apparently, they can't live on candy canes alone. No, I don't suppose they could. Are you alone? The boyfriend desert you? No. -No? Don't tell me you broke up. He's helping Aunt Myrt with some packages, okay? What a regular Boy Scout. Do you have any plans to go back? And by "go back", I mean, like, you know... really go back? I'm working on it. -Okay. Well, hey, if you happen to remember any winning lottery numbers before you go... That's a great idea. Hey, Ben, if you could go back in time, is there anything that you would change? Yeah, maybe one thing. -Really? What is it? It's personal. -Oh. Yeah. Between me and Frosty. So... I'll see you around. Frosty? No wonder he's single. You really think your plan will work? Will they even remember? It has to, or in eight years... What's gonna happen in eight years? That's freakily specific. It's statistics, because once you see the cracks in a marriage, bad things happen. You've been acting very odd this whole trip. Oh, have I? Oh, I see what's happening. You do? You're working too hard. It's the stress of med school. Yep. Yep. You figured it out. You're so good. Okay, sport. You're ready. My turn. Oh! -Oh. Who's ready for somewhere holiday cheer? Looking like that, I'd guess every woman in Shepard's Ferry. I've never felt more underdressed in my life. Oh, no rush. I always like to be camera-ready just in case. So what's the plan? I'm gonna finish getting ready. You're gonna go ahead with everyone else, and I'll come later with Mom. She won't be suspicious we're going separately? Nope. Not the way I have it planned. Oh! -How you doing, Mom? I cannot find the dress I was supposed to wear tonight. Oh, maybe you sent it to the cleaners. I did, but I am sure I got it back, and I have no idea what happened to it! Yeah. That is very odd. Why don't you wear something else? I have nothing that's appropriate or fancy enough. I have an idea. Huh? -Angie, that's 35 years old. It's perfect. You're gonna look stunning in it. You wear that tonight, you will be the hit of the party. all: Thank you. Isn't this incredible? She always outdoes herself. Merry Christmas, one and all! Oh, I'm so happy to see you! Hi, Myrt. -Oh. George, you look as young and as handsome as the first time we met. You are too kind. Wait a minute, are these the carolers, the same ones from... Some of them, yes! From the very first party. And you remembered? Oh, they're just wonderful. Tyler, it's so good to see you again. Oh, it's good to see you too. Thank you for including me. And without your phone. I got dressed! You most certainly did! And I have a surprise for you, young man. Why don't you go and have a look at the very special centerpiece in the dining room? We don't run in the house, Henrik. Where are Evelyn and Angie? Oh, they'll... they'll be along. Yeah, something about a dress mix-up or something. Well, in that case, you two will be my arm candy till they get here. Wow! That is quite the spread. Wow. -That's my house! Look! We see! How about that? You know, I thought that looked familiar. Kid's a natural. Quite the honor. No wonder we all love that woman. Another winner, Myrt. Just like always. Thank you. I look forward to this party every single year. Tyler, do you know George actually met Evelyn here, didn't you, George? As a matter of fact, I did, yeah. You know what, I think I was standing right here at the time too. Good memories? Now that I think about it, the best. It was a lonely holiday for me, if you remember, and I...about to spend another Christmas alone. I was saying goodbye to everybody. Clock struck 9:00, and I remember turning. And there she was. George Reynolds, have you met Evelyn Marshall? I don't believe I've had the pleasure. Evelyn is it? Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Please call me George, or I'm afraid I won't answer. You look gorgeous. Can you believe that this is the dress I wore the day that I met you? -I know! You're still the prettiest girl in the room. In any room. You're not so bad yourself. Hey. You look beautiful. Aw. Thanks, Ben. Looks like the spark is alive and well. Good work. Thanks. Tyler Grant. Attention, everybody. Thank you. I would like to welcome you all to my annual Christmas party. Now, I'm not one for speeches, and you all know that. But tonight, I would like to propose a toast. Our dear, dear friend Angie Reynolds... come here, Angie. Angie has come back to us tonight from medical school, and she brought with her her fiancé, Mr. Tyler Grant. Where is he? Absolutely. Sure. All right. All right. Bye-bye. Hey. -Hey. You missed Aunt Myrt's speech to us. Oh, shoot! Let me make it up to you. I'm gonna grab us some wine, and we can have our own toast. Tyler, this is a really important night for us. It's just family, you know? They understand. Just family? -Don't move. I will be right back. -Ugh. Hey. -Hey. You okay? Honestly, I don't know. Thanks. Where's Chloe? Oh, that is a tragic Hollywood story. Boy meets girl. Boy fake dates girl. Bought and girl fake break up. Aww. I'm so fake sorry to hear that. I appreciate it. But her father has a law firm in Boston. Mergers and acquisitions. It's big time. And I get my degree in a year, and she said she's gonna put in a good word for me. So... No, Ben, family law is where your heart's always been. I kind of feel like my heart's always been... somewhere else. Angie, come on in! You have to see this! Oh. That was beautiful. Look! This is a cow. This is a hen. This is a horse. This is a pig... We're gonna be okay. I hope so. Let's go. We haven't danced like this in years. No time has passed at all. I'm afraid we've forgotten how to connect. Just didn't know how to talk to you about it. And you know how hard it is for me to open up. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. It's no one's fault. Just, relationships need tending, and we haven't been paying attention. We can still fix that, though, right? If we want to. I do. I do too. I've missed you so much. You give me another chance, and you'll never have to miss me again. I want a relationship like that. You have it all, Kristen. I hope you know that. And I'm so grateful for Peter, for Henrik. We've decided not to pursue the IVF anymore. After a year of disappointment, we can't go through it again. Oh, Kristen. Is it the money? -We're just tired. The whole process is so stressful. If it's meant to be, it'll happen. Can I offer you some advice, sister to sister? There are other options. We never know what the future holds. Well, as it happens, I do, and I happen to know that there is a very special little girl out there waiting for you and Peter. May take a few years, but she will be worth the wait. I actually believe you. Thanks for that. I'm really sorry, Kristen. I'm sorry I didn't know... that I didn't ask. Hanging with you this week has actually been fun. Maybe because things have been so hard. Yeah. I'm gonna visit more, okay? Henrik's growing way too fast. Please, just a phone call once in a while, or... I get it. -Email. I get it. -Text. I'm gonna text you. Or carrier pigeon. You know what the best part of this Christmas is? Tyler's proposal? You and me, here, right now. Me too. Between me and Frosty? Do you know what that means, Boomer? Hmm. Hey. What did he mean by that? Why are you asking me? I don't know the man. So Ben, always talking in riddles, it's very frustrating. Friends a long time, I take it. Oh, yeah, since grade school. I mean, until I moved to Manhattan, we did everything together. We took family vacations together, shared our plans for our future, we finished each other's sentences. I mean, it was... -Ah. Actually, it was kind of wonderful. But now there's Tyler. Right. Tyler. -Yeah. If it wasn't Tyler, if it wasn't Mom and Dad, and it wasn't Kristen, what is it, Boomer? If I don't figure this out soon, I'm gonna be stuck here forever. Yes? -Hey, sleepyhead. Get up. Get dressed. We got a taxi on the way. Barcelona? Right. Okay. Right. Okay. Nice PJs. Hey, is everything okay? I don't know. I don't think so. You're not going. You're an amazing man. -Oh, no. Nothing good ever followed a sentence like that. Look, if the timing's not right, we could take a break. -Oh. You have your school. I can focus on the career. You know, we'll put this on hold a while. Yeah, we could do that. We could, but it wouldn't work. How do you know? -I know. And knowing what I know, I can't marry you. You can't marry me. -I'm so sorry. For the longest time, I thought you were the one. I thought...I thought if I just said yes, then my life would be perfect. It would be! Angie! -No, I was wrong. Aunt Myrt said it. You know, some people, they just belong together. That isn't us. We're not a match. I guess we never were. I really thought we were it. That's what makes this so hard. You deserve a woman who loves you just as much. You have such an incredible life ahead, and an incredible woman to meet. I don't want to meet an incredible woman. I want you! Okay, that didn't come out right. It's fine. Really, it's gonna be okay. Now go. Don't miss your plane, or your taxi. Bye. all: Do you girls remember coming here when you were little? Every Christmas Eve, how excited you get, waiting for them to light the star on top of the tree? We loved it. But we were so nervous that we would miss Santa and he wouldn't be able to find us. Remember? We always did. -Yeah. I love you guys so much. I hope all your Christmas wishes come true. I know mine has. Can you feel it? -Feel what, Grandpa? It's coming. You'll see. It's getting close. -Yeah, it's about time. Gets me every time. Every time! I always knew this was my favorite Christmas. Just... never knew why until this moment. Honey, what are you talking about? Just, you know, I've been focusing too much on things that don't matter in the long run, when this whole time, everything I needed was just a short train ride away. My family. Well, you got us, sweetheart. You always will. What more could I ask for? -Hot chocolate, maybe? Mmm. -Who's up for it? On me. Let's see hands. Me! -Come on with me, sport. You can pay for it. You got a 20 on you? So I wish it had worked out for you this trip. Tyler and all. Thanks. We weren't meant to be. Took me a while to realize that, but so clear now. There's nothing more I could ask for this Christmas. Really? Well, how about this? I found this at the bottom of that jewelry box. I thought it would only complicate things with you and Tyler, but now you need to see this. "Between me and Frosty." Is that what he was talking about? "You have my whole heart, Angie. You always have. And no matter where life takes us, that will never change." My turn for some sisterly advice? Tyler wasn't your forever. Ben is, and you love Ben. Ben. I love Ben. I love Ben! The rest of us have known for years. I'm surprised it took you this long to figure that out. All aboard! -That's it! What? -Oh, my gosh! It wasn't you. It wasn't Mom and Dad. It wasn't even Ben. It was everyone! It was the whole package! It was the entire Christmas! I have to go. -Go where? Angie, wait! I have to find Ben! Well, he's probably still at Santa's Village! Santa's Village! North Pole! Merry Christmas! Hey, Ben, it's Angie. Listen, the return ticket is back! I'm leaving tonight. I mean, right now! Tonight? Why? -Look, listen to me. I got the note, you know, the one Frosty was keeping from me. I thought you read that years ago. No, I never did. That's why I didn't know how you felt... how you feel. Oh, gosh. I really hope you still feel that way. Wait a second, I'm just gonna say it. I love you, Ben. I always have. I guess it just took me a little Christmas magic to realize it. Where are you? -The train is back. No, I'll be right there. We'll be pulling out soon. Oh, no, no, no. We can't... we can't leave yet. I'm afraid I'm not in charge of the schedule. Angie, I'm on my way right now. The train is leaving! I haven't had a chance to tell you... Wait, Ben, please. Don't take Chloe's offer, okay? It won't make you happy. Your heart is too big for that job. Well, when am I gonna see you again? I don't know. Wait, tonight. Christmas Eve, ten years from now, I'll meet you at the Hamilton Inn at 10:00. I'll be there waiting. Merry Christmas. Angie. Chop chop. Ticket, please. Oh. Well, there you are. Worth the wait, I hope. Do we have to leave now? Better find a seat. Come on. Come on. Have I been sitting here this whole time? Yeah. Oh. Okay. Mom? Oh, honey, I'm so glad we caught you. It's Christmas Eve, you know, and we wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. The whole family's here. Come on, you guys. Say hello. all: Merry Christmas! Hi. Hey, where's Dad? Daddy? Right here. I'm on hot cider duty. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. You're there. You're... you're home. At Christmas? You bet I am. And you haven't met this one yet. Not officially. This is our Vanessa. Oh, my gosh, Kristen, is she yours? Thanks to Ben. Wait. Ben Lee? Yeah, of course, who else would it be? Cut through all the red tape. Ben. And the question is, when are you coming home to meet your new niece? -Yeah! Hey, Christmas is tomorrow, Aunt Angie. Just saying. Hi, Henrik. You know what, I don't know. I have to check with the hospital. Okay, well, your room's always open. Of course I have all my pottery things in there, but I can clear them out in a snap! Oh, hey, Mom, this is the hospital calling. I have to go, but I'll see what I can do, okay? Merry Christmas! I love you all! Love you! Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas! Hurry home! Hey, Sabrina. -About time. We've been trying to reach you. I hope you're on your way. Oh, no, is something wrong? Haven't you checked your messages? The whole team is waiting. You're on call tonight, remember? Okay, look, we can do the prep, but the rest is up to you. Right. Right. Of course. Yeah, I'll be right there. Oh, my gosh, I'm exhausted. At least you have all day to catch up tomorrow. No surgeries scheduled for Christmas. Yeah. -Any plans? Yeah, actually. I think I'm gonna go home. To your family? What changed? So much. Wait a second. Tomorrow's Christmas. This is Christmas Eve! Whoa, okay, sharp as ever. You have some place to be? What time is it? -It's late, a little past 11:00. Shoot, I'm late! Okay, you have plans. Plans I made ten years ago. Help me with this dress. Oh, my God. Hi. Oh, are you closing? Christmas Eve. Not a big night for business. Oh, my gosh. I'm too late. After all this time, I'm too late. Hello? Hi. Hey, Ben, oh, my God, I'm so sorry I'm late. Wait a second, how did you get my new number? The salads are getting cold, but at least you're here now. I'm here? You waited. What's an hour or two? Compared to ten years? -Okay, now you lost me. No, I found you. Wow. That was some kiss. You'd think I haven't seen you in weeks. When was the last time I saw you? Um, Tuesday dinner. With David and his wife. David. -Yes, David. That's right. -Yeah. My partner at the law firm, David. Yes, family law. -Yes. You love taking credit for that, don't you? Oh, my gosh, it's all coming back to me. Okay. You know what I think you need? Aside from some serious time off work? Some champagne. Here's to another year of friendship, another year of romance, another year with you. I love you. Merry Christmas. The best Christmas gift ever. Well, that might make this a little anticlimactic. Oh, is it my favorite spaghetti? Thank you. Voila! The Frosty box? -Mm-hmm. Oh, Ben. Angie Reynolds, will you finally marry me? Yes! No taking it back. Well, one thing this proves. Good things are worth waiting for? My family's gonna be so surprised. Well, they've been hinting for ten years, so relieved might be a little more like it. Hey, do me a favor on this trip. Don't let me fall asleep.
