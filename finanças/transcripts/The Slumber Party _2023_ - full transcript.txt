And before you even ask, yes, you did just see three teenagers riding a giant hedgehog. So I'm sure you have a lot of questions like, "Hey, Megs, how did you lose your eyebrow?" Honestly, I wish I knew. So let's just start at the beginning and hopefully we'll find all the answers we're looking for. ["Classic" playing] [Megan] That's Anna Maria, the birthday girl. She's my best friend and the reason I'm currently flailing mid air toward a smelly dumpster. ♪ Come to me, baby Don't be shy ♪ [Megan] High school starts in one week and there's no way I could do it without her. [Anna Maria's mom] Anna Maria. Your dad's here to see you. -[groans] -[Megan] Please excuse her teen angst. She's going through a lot right now. ♪ It was a summer time That summer high ♪ -This is my other best friend, Paige. -[kisses] See you tomorrow, Shroomy. [Megan] She's fearless and loyal. In second grade, when Mia Thomas bullied me for not having a mom, Paige convinced her to cut off her own ponytail at recess. Mikey, I need a ride. [Mikey] Not happening. Fine. Don't be surprised when Mom finds out who prank-called Grandma and told her she won the lottery.

Our friendship is fairly recent. ♪ Come to me, baby Don't be shy ♪ ♪ So classic ♪ ♪ Come to me, baby Don't be shy ♪ Hey, this is me. But seriously. How cute am I with symmetrical eyebrows? I tend to overthink things. Some would call me cautious. I just like to be comfortable. Who doesn't? But I'm working on it. I do not wanna bring the limitations of my youth to high school. Okay. [stammers] Now you're like, "Geez, Megs. You really know yourself for only being 14." -[doorbell rings] -Yeah. Well, self-awareness is kind of a given when both your parents are therapists. -[music stops] -[cell phone ringing] Dad. Why are you calling me from downstairs? [Dad] Oh, just making sure your phone's charged. Paige is here. -I know I'll be right down. -Okay. -I love you. -Love you. -The grasshopper phone. -[sad trombone plays] According to my parents, screen time is more harmful than being the only teenager in Atlanta without a smartphone. This little device is powered by sheer humiliation, which is why no one has ever seen this phone of shame and no one ever will. ["Classic" resumes] Love what you've done with the place, Conrad. Dr. Brookman. And thank you, Paige. Hey, Paige. [Paige] Hey, Megs. -Bye, Dads. -Mmm. Remember to make good choices. You are strong. You are smart. You can do hard things. Man. Do you guys always speak in inspirational quotes? You're like the clearance aisle at HomeGoods. Have the most fun ever. But not too much. Auditions for freshman flute solos are next week.

Didn't you hear me saying your skirt was caught in the door? -[Megan sighs] -It's-- Okay. It's fine. It's fine. I'm sure no one saw. [Anna Maria's mom] I've tried to-- [dad] I just-- I can't keep having this c-- -Please, you talk to her. -I know. I've tried. -She's your daughter t-- -I've tried so many times. -How many times do I have to explain-- -Mija, we talked about this. Veronica is going to be your stepsister. Now, she seems like a really sweet girl, so I appreciate you including her in your slumber party tonight. Is this a joke? Isn't it bad enough he's getting remarried on my birthday? Oh, mi amorcita, please. Look, we tried. We tried to find any other date. This is the only one that the venue had available before your new baby sister is born. Don't remind me. The last thing I need is another little sister. Hey. Your father having this baby is a real blessing. At his age, it's more like a miracle. [mom] Well, she's not wrong. Okay, I'm gonna go. Uh, I will drop Veronica off a-after her parkour lesson. -Whoa. -And thank you very much, Anna, for keeping your parkour comments to yourself. And I will be by early tomorrow to pick you up for our annual birthday hike. Don't bother. I'm not going. Hey, we go every year. -Well, not this year. -[mom] Anna, that's enough. Well, why should he have anything stay the same when he's the one making everything different? Hey, who is the parent around here? Hmm? You keep this up and you are not gonna like what happens next. -Okay, viejo, relájate, please. -You let her-- Haven't you been reading those gentle parenting books-- -[speaking Spanish] -No, cállate. You don't talk about our daughter that way. Can you both just stop? You can force me to go to your wedding. You can even force me to have your new kid at my party, but you can't force me to go on some stupid hike -on my birthday. -[doorbell rings] [mom] Anna… Why'd you do that? Obviously they're in the middle of something. Because I was ready for it to be the end of something. -Hello, girls. -Hey, Mr. Guerrero. For a second, I forgot you don't live here anymore. Sorry. I have pants in my bag. Okay. Have fun, girls. -What just happened? What'd I miss? -[Paige] Nothing. Just some minor, unnecessary awkwardness. [sighs] Welcome to the casa de Guerrero. That's our specialty. -Let's do our warm-up. -[Paige] What are you doing? -Let us be your personal trainers today. -[cheering on TV] [Megan] If there was an offbeat, you're, like, offbeat the offbeat. Guys, how is clapping and walking so hard? Seriously, this was not my plan for our epic night. [Paige] We're just getting warmed up. Literally. -I'm done. -[both laugh] [Paige] All right, birthday girl says we're done. -[TV turns off] -[Megan] Ooh, give me the Oreos. [gasps] New shoes? Those are awesome. Thanks. Guilt gift from my mom. -Well, I mean, they are Jordan 3s. -[Paige] True, true. [Anna Maria] Come on, guys. We need to do something big. We're in high school now. What if we break into West Oak and free those baby ducks from the science lab? -You're obsessed with those baby ducks. -Oh, my gosh. What if we connected the shopping carts at Target together with zip ties like a giant, red centipede? Ooh, remember when Mikey woke us up at 2:00 a.m. to help him fill your sister's car with watermelon? When did we do that? [whispers] Oh. You guys had a sleepover without me. Whi-- Which is fine. It's-- It's totally fine. [Anna Maria] It was a long time ago. We were going to Six Flags the next morning, and we know -how you feel about Six Flags. -Exactly. Does anybody truly enjoy being at Six Flags? -Yeah. -Yeah. Okay. It was one time. I didn't know the drop was gonna be that big. And technically, I didn't even ask them to stop the ride. They just got all worried when all the crying stopped and they thought I was dead. How many other things do you guys do without me? Not that many. "Not that many"? What does that mean? [both sighing] Look. Megan. -Megs. -Megsters. Meggie Poo. [sighs] Don't take this the wrong way. You're kinda scared to try new things. -Yeah, I know. -Wait, what? My dads are therapists. I've been talking about this since I was four. You know, but tonight? Tonight's gonna be different. Tonight, I'm gonna get out of my comfort zone. Try new things. Anna Maria, we're gonna forget all about your dad and the beast-troll. And, Paige, we're gonna make a name for you before we even step on campus. Okay. We're gonna be so ready for freshman year. -You're serious? -Oh, yeah. Tonight's gonna be epic. [Megan] Let's see. We could do… Learn Hip-Hop with Brian Austin Green or watch a movie called Tommy Boy. [Anna Maria] No more TV. -I say we TP Jake Ramirez's house. -[Paige] Yeah. Jake-- Jake-Jake who? I've never heard of him. -[Paige chuckles] Let's go. -[Megan] What? No, no, no, no. Please. No, no, no. We're not doing this. -[Anna Maria] Whoa. -Oh, so you're coming with us? -Awesome. Perfect. -[Anna Maria] Come on. -[Megan] No. No, no, no! -Okay, let's go. Whoo-hoo! -[door opens] -[visitor] Hell yeah! Let's do this. What are we doing? Do we need a sweater? I chill easily. Sorry I'm late, gals. My parkour lesson ran long. And high. And low. Get it? It's a parkour pun. [screams] [grunts] -[Paige] Ooh. -[visitor groans] I'm good. [coughs] Just a little spill. -What in the parkour? -I'm Veronica. I'm sure Anna Maria has told you all about me. I'm her favorite new stepsister. -Her dad just dropped me off. -Which isn't weird at all. Exactly. He's the best. And, technically, you're not my stepsister until tomorrow, so let's not jump the gun. They could still totally change their minds. No way. They are all over each other. Right… [in Spanish accent] …Anna Maria? Any way you can stop saying my name in an accent? It makes me want to die a little. -Mm-hmm. -So, where do you go to school? -I'm homeschooled. -Explains a lot. -[Veronica] Uh-huh. -[Anna Maria] Great. Now the Three Amigos are more like the Freakish Foursome. Hey, Veronica. Why don't you unpack and make yourself at home while we sidebar with the birthday girl? Oh, sure. Absolutely. Sounds good. Maybe you could tell her she's doing long-term damage to my self-esteem. -What? -Uh-- Dude, harsh much? Tonight was supposed to just be us. It's my birthday. Okay. We hear you, and your feelings are valid. -Thank you. -But is this what the rest of the night's gonna be like? Because I haven't felt this awkward since that substitute forced me to write a Mother's Day card. [laughs] Oh, man. I remember that. I'm sure Mr. Quan is enjoying his early retirement. Let's feel all of these feelings in here. But out there, let's have some fun. I know. You guys are right. -Okay. Good. -Nice. Even if Veronica's stealing my dad and crashing my slumber party. Okay. So we're still feeling things. I don't want a stepmother or a stepsister or a baby half-sister. I just want one mom with one dad and one annoying little sister, like a normal family. What's that supposed to mean? You know, you're talking to someone with two dads, right? [smacks lips] Yeah. You know, and I am the "baby half-sister" in my family. My mom's been married, like, three or four times. So maybe we're not the target demo for this. I-I didn't mean it like that. Well, then, how did you mean it? I just meant that I wanna be in a regular family again. Okay. Well, that clears things up. -All good? -So good. Yeah. Totally better now. Cool. Yeah. Seems like it. -[screams] -[all scream] [laughs] -You psychopath! -Who even does that? You're gonna grow up to be one of those people who dresses up like a bush and scares tourists for a living. A girl can dream. Penny, what do you even want? And whatever it is, no. I just want to hang out. Be included. I could film your posts or tell jokes. What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta. Get out. Hard pass. Come on, please? It's not fair. Why do you guys always leave me out? Because you can't keep your mouth shut. And this is a slumber party, which is based on the foundation of secrets. I can keep a secret. I never told anybody you once farted so loud in church that you woke yourself up. You did kind of just spill the beans. -Pun intended. -[Anna Maria] Penny. I'm gonna give you three seconds to get out of this basement before I lock you in the storage room for the rest of the night. And I'll tell Mom that we're including you when she asks where you are. Like you could even. -Oh, I'll help her. -Me too. I can remove the lightbulbs in there. One. Two. -Three! -[Veronica screams] This isn't over.

You're a West Oak Warrior now. Hillside's enemy territory. Aren't you gonna stay and help us? Look, Paige, I'm Hillside enemy number one. Too risky. I'm out. Wow, Mikey. [inhales deeply] I expected more. [engine starts] So, this is how the rich kids live. I heard they serve sashimi in the cafeteria and you can pay your way out of PE. [scoffs] Gross. I'll take the half-dead grass and half-dead principal at West Oak any day. [chuckles] -[chirping] -[gasps] I knew it. You do love me. [chattering] Where's Veronica? Okay. [sighs] I don't think we'll be able to sneak in there without Mikey. We need to figure out how Anna Maria got Hillside's colors on her new shoe. Ouch. What-- [chirping] What the duck is that? What is what? It's nothing. I-It's not a duck. [Paige] That is a duck. It was a gift from my man. Come here, Bill. Don't worry. A duck doesn't mean anything. I'm gonna kill him. [marching band playing] [gasps] The marching band, my people. Maybe they know where Anna Maria is. Let's go. Come on. [Veronica] Guys, wait for me. [song ends] [all grunt] [trumpet blowing] These are your people? I thought they were. They look like they ate the middle school band for breakfast. What do you mean if I had been here? You're the one who ran after Ava Hakakian offering to polish her cymbals. O-- Okay. Whoa, whoa. Let's keep it clean, please. -[chirping] -[musician 1] Oh. What, clean? [breathes heavily] [musician 2] The last thing this school needs is more drama. Don't. Don't. -[musician 1] I just find it fascinating… -No. Please, no. …who wants us to keep things clean. [Veronica farts] [groans] -Real classy, Brixton. -That wasn't me. And I'm not the one who left the hedgehog out in the open, making it easy to steal. [musician 3] Dude, what else was I supposed to do? -I can't. -You have to hold it. -You have to. -No. No. [sneezes] -[Paige] How could you-- -[Veronica] I'm sorry. -I can't-- I can't-- -They're right there. -[musician 2 clears throat] -Oh, sh-- -[Megan] Whoa. -[Veronica] Ouch. [Paige] Hey! Yo, watch it, music man. It's you. You-- You who? Me? Hey, what's your deal? Hold on. I got this. You wanna go? [Veronica breathes heavily] -Pfft. -[Veronica] That's what I thought. Are you done? Because you ladies have something we want. Parents who didn't participate in the college admissions scandal? [chuckles] Funny, especially coming from a gang of degenerates who could be charged with grand theft hedgehog. Uh, come again? Last night, you stole our homecoming hedgehog float. Hedgie? FYI, love hedgehogs. I did a report on them. You have a lot of nerve coming back here. Okay, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Don't even try to deny it. We have proof. [growling] [Veronica] Oh, my gosh. This thing smells like puke. [chuckles] You have to see Meg. [laughing] -There she is. -[Anna Maria] Please show Meg. -[Paige] Hey! -[Veronica] Oh, yeah! [Megan] I'm actually saving myself for Hedgie. -[Paige] Ooh. -[Megan groans] [laughing] [whispering] -[Veronica] Okay. -[Paige] Yeah, yeah. [Megan] I already know what to say. I got this. Okay? [Paige] Okay. -[clears throat] So, funny thing. -[chuckles] Um, I know you have this video and all, but, uh, we don't actually remember anything that happened last night, so we don't know where your hedgehog float is. No, it is true. You have to believe us-- No, you have to believe us. We want our hedgehog back, and we want him back now. Yeah, and we have what you want. Oh, my gosh. I think they have Anna Maria. What I'm sure you really, really want back. Just to clarify, are we talking about-- Enough talk. If you wanna find out, bring our float to the Groundtown Café on Oak Street at two o'clock and we'll make the swap. No funny business. But it's already almost noon, and we're telling the truth. We don't know where your hedgehog is. Well, I'd say you're sufficiently motivated to find it. And I wouldn't be late. We have all the evidence we need to prosecute. And my mom's a lawyer. -So is mine. -So is mine. -[drum beats] -[marching] [marching band plays] [chirping] Come on, Bill. Stay with the group. -[chirping continues] -[Veronica sighs] Now, instead of searching for a missing girl, we are searching for a missing hedgehog. [Megan sighs] This is my own fault. Anna Maria is being held hostage because I had to try new things. I knew we couldn't trust that sketchy hypnotist. Who even knows if they have their hypnotist license? -You know what? I-I think hypnotism sucks. -Whoa, language. I can't believe I just watched a video of myself grinding on a papier-mâché hedgehog. It never asked for that. I mean, I can convince myself that we broke into West Oak to rescue ducks for a good cause, but stealing of the hedgehog float? For what? We might as well be on America's Dumbest Criminals. -Oh, my God. Do ya? -Love that show. Do ya, Veronica? Did you do a report on it? Will you two stop fighting? I can't take it anymore. D-- Did you just yell at me? She totally just yelled at you. No. [sighs] I mean, yes, possibly. We never yell at each other. -What is the deal? -The deal is-- I just-- I think if we're not going to tell an adult that Anna Maria is missing because we're high schoolers and we can handle it ourselves, then we need to start acting like adults. You mean, like, ignore the climate crisis and waste all our free time fighting in Facebook groups? I mean we need to focus. Those band freaks have our friend, and all this bickering between you two is not helping. Okay, fine. I'll keep my mouth shut. -[Megan sighs] That's not what I meant. -[cell phone ringing] -[sighs] -[Megan] Paige… Just-- [sighs] Yello? You're stressed out, which is freaking me out because it means that you're worried that we won't find her. Hey. We're gonna find her. Ooh, this looks intense. -Am I interrupting? -Always. Who was that on the phone? That was Captain Bootleg. Well? Can he get us in touch with Mesmer? What did he say? He said, "Arr! They be unreachable." [both sigh] Mesmer's booked. Working at the Chattahoochee Onion Fest. [crowd chattering] This place is packed. How come I never knew onion fest was a thing? Because only a certain kind of people go to onion festivals. Guys, I love the Chattahoochee Onion Fest. Sure, it's no Greenville Garlic Festival, -but let's get real, what is, amirite? -No. We don't have time to wait in this line. We have to get in there and find Mesmer. [Veronica sniffs] I've got an idea. We might be able to pull a Mikey. Okay. This way. Let's go. [panting] Okay. This will be the fastest way. Let's go. Let's go. [crowd chattering] Let's go. Oh. [country music plays] -Oh! -[chattering] Finally, you're here. Rita, Vera, Esther Chen. Quick, quick, quick. We almost started without you. [Veronica] Look! Look! It's Mesmer. Mesmer's the Great Onion. Oh, hello, little onion sprout. The Great Onion. What's so great about you? Oh… [laughs] …silly little shallot. [chuckles] Uh, I have a great attitude, okay? -Say, "onions." -[shutter clicking] -No? Or don't. Okay, thank you. -[guardian] Thank you. Okay. All right, I gotta take five. My shoes are killing me. [patron] Wait, what? [child laughs] Come on. We'll tell him we changed our minds and we're out. [contestant laughs] I knew you girls couldn't be in the right place. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

But I've never taken a bite out of a raw onion like an apple. Okay. What are we doing? Trying new things. That's my girl. I'm winning this munch. Yeah! [cheering] In your dreams, Esther. Buckle up, Beetlejuice. It's showtime. Hey, um, do you think you could take this? -[spectator] Yeah. Hello, baby. Okay. -Thank you so much. Oh, she's not playing.

It's mine. It's mine, okay? It's my phone. It's mine. Yeah. What even is this? An iPhone Negative 12? Does it text in hieroglyphics?
