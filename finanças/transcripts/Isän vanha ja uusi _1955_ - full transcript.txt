Father's old and new Lorenzo's Dance School Stop! Mr Pekanpaa, you have to concentrate on the rhythm more. That's what the rumba's all about. Like this. It isn't easy for us northerners... ...and there's only one way to learn it. You have to surrender to it. It must come from within. Understand? More passion, more fervor! You've certainly got the idea... just don't hesitate for a moment. It's already going better for you, ma'am. I think you've got some southern rhythm in your blood. Let me dance with you now. Just a moment. So, Mr Pekanpaa... we'll try once more. I really have to go now. Why? You've nothing on. I forgot an important meeting at the office. Please excuse me. Well I'm not leaving. Don't forget the Franco-Finnish Society ball tonight. Of course not. Goodbye Mr Lorenzo. See you later, Babs. Daddy! Kaisa! - Hi kid! - Hi, Daddy! What are you doing here. For a dance lesson. Our school has it here. Why are you here? I've also been having a dance lesson. - How's your mum, Matti and Jyrki? - Fine thanks. You know Jyrki gets married next week. Yes, I got an invitation. But I have to go now. Say hi for me to everyone. here's a bit of pocket money. Bye bye.. - Was that your dad? - Yeah. You really have a dad? What did you think I was? A test-tube baby? Dad and mum are divorced, and dad has married again. Wow! What a fur coat... Look... mink! - Is it really mink? - Golly! This fabric is suitable, but I want to see it in place. We can have the whole roll delivered to your home. I'd like for you to see it there, Mrs Pekanpaa. - I have faith in your taste. - I'd be happy to. - When would suit you? - Tomorrow, perhaps? I'll see you tomorrow, then. - So, Kaisa, what do you want? - Guess who I saw? - A flying saucer? - Daddy. Good guess... Where? At Lorenzo's dance school. He seemed embarrassed. - Would he need dance lessons? - Perhaps. - He did dance well when he was young. - But now he's old! Isn't it silly? He must be doing what the new one wants. Did you see her, too? No, but the flash mink coat would have been hers. If only you had one too! Are your friends coming this evening? Yes. And now I have money. Dad gave me 1,000 marks. I'm off again. Bye bye! Mauri! Mauri, get up and get dressed! Come on... get up and get changed. We have to go in half an hour. Go where? Where?! To the Franco-Finnish Society do. I told you not to lie on the sofa. If only I could have a quiet evening at home some time. You'd just read and sleep. Couldn't you do that, too? Why do we always have to be rushing about? Don't give me that old refrain again. Or should I say... old fogy's refrain? Thank you. At least you can dance. Though otherwise an idiot, eh? - I didn't say that. - It's what you thought. The way you said... Don't always twist my words. Look! Maija and Tapsa are dancing the boogie. They're like calves in spring... but they probably can't polka. Hi. Hi. Do you know who that is, dancing with Babs? No. He's Chile's embassy secretary from Stockholm. His name's Blasco da Gama. Caramba! Who was the dark guy you were dancing so assiduously with? - He wasn't dark. - Not a nigger, but almost. You're being very rude. He didn't have drop of negro blood. He's Chilean nobility. A very fine man, and rich. You found out a lot. Did he fall in love with you? Would that be impossible? Others have been in love with me...- ...but that didn't make me happy. But this one does? Haven't you massaged your face enough? I want to sleep. Sleeping is all you can do. I want to drink champagne and dance. Can't you go dancing in another room? I'm still young. I want to live and love... ...but you're old and burnt out. I'll be back in a couple of hours, if anyone asks. Okay. He's been weird lately. I showed him an alteration this morning. I wanted to demolish a middle wall, but he said... ...that I could demolish all the walls. Maybe he has a hangover. He may have to eat his words. I'll draw up a house with no walls at all! Good morning. - Is Mrs Pekanpaa in? - Yes, in her workroom. - Can I go in? - Certainly. - Mauri... what a surprise! - Hi. I just happened to be walking past, and thought I'd drop in. You're welcome. Sit down there... Push that wool aside. This looks a difficult job. You do your own weaving? As you can see. I'm just doing it... ...while my weaver is at lunch. I enjoy doing it. It's great that you started with this... ...when you... - When I became single. I had a lot of time... When you didn't have to look after me. When the children were big, I meant. How are things with you? I have work and hassles. Actually, I am very unhappy. Don't you love her any more? What was her name again? Babs. Actually Elisabet, but she's known as Babs. I don't know if I've loved her as I've loved you. I've only myself to blame for everything. For my my frivolity and for my stupidity. I messed up all by myself. I got another picture of your feelings, 4 years ago. You were irritated and quarrelsome, didn't like being at home. - You started drinking too much. - Far too much. - And then came the affairs. - Into the bargain. Let's not rake over old coals. You now Matti has his matriculation exam soon. Yes... doesn't time fly? And Jyrki will shortly be married. Next Thursday. You were invited, weren't you? Yes, of course. Listen, Armi, you wouldn't consider...? What? Phone for you, ma'am. Thanks. Excuse me a moment. Hi Pekka! For lunch? Yes, thanks, that's be lovely. Right away? You'll pick me up in the car? Great... See you. What were you saying, Mauri? I was only wondering if you'd like... ...to have lunch with me. - Lunch? - Yes. Thanks, but I just promised... Who? I know, it's not for me to ask. Well, I guess I'd better go. Goodbye then, Mauri. Armi. Well, well! Hello, Mauri! Let's congratulate each other. Our eldest son has got married. Yes... Reveals our age. You still look so young and delightful. Wouldn't it be nice, if you, I, Matti and Kaarina... ...had a wedding dinner together? We're having dinner with the bride's parents. Won't you be there? I wasn't invited. - How rude of them. - Be quiet! - I am the bridegroom's father, after all. - That you are. - We're going now, Mum. - Hello, Daddy. Hello, Kaarina. Hello, Matti. Well, we'd best be going. I'll drive you. Is that OK? Thanks, but we're being picked up. Goodbye, Mauri. They were a handsome couple. - Jyrki was pale at the start. - Not so much. Standing there half an hour, waiting fir the bride. I'd have civil marriage. It depends on your fiancee... ...and if I read your new girl Pirkko right... ...she'd want a church wedding, with kids carrying her train. - Not your kids. - Maybe your own? That's enough, you two! - Shall we go home? - Sure. What an idiot!. He should never have had a licence. Of course I am. Don't you believe me? Why? You are crazy, darling! Okay, Margaret, I'll buy the books we talked about and I'll send them to you. Yes, Kungsgatan 13. Sorry, Kungsgatan 15, of course. Thank you, Margaret, have a very nice time. My regards to Mr Morris too. Thank you. How was the wedding. Weddings are always beautiful. Especially one's own children's. Who were you talking to? Margaret Bolton. She want's me to come over to Stockholm. I thought I'd go over in spring... if you'd no objections. Of course I haven't. You go. Mauri, you're a sweetie! That's something I haven't heard for a long time. - What are you up to now? - Up to? I'm not up to anything. I'm mostly nice to you. But you're just bored and angry. I promised we'd meet the Lindens, at the Savoy this evening. Without asking me? You know I can't stand them. Because they're my friends. You find all my friends horrible. Don't start with that again! I'm not coming to the Savoy. Forget it! Stay stuck at home. Would you get me my slippers, Kaisa? - I saw Dad in the church. - Well he is Jyrki's father. I was angry that you smiled so sweetly to him. Why shouldn't I have smiled? You didn't have to. Everyone knows you're divorced. You can forgive a lot after 3 years. You haven't forgiven him everything, have you? Almost. And it feels better. Thanks, Kaisa. Was Dad's new wife in the church, too? No. People would have expected to see her there. Goddamn bimbo. Dad looked so stylish in a morning coat. Hello. Tekla is always just as young. Not a single Grey hair. But you have plenty, Mr Pekanpaa. - Golly, that's Daddy! - What's he want? - Is Madam home? - Everyone's home. - Go on in. - Thanks. Hope I'm not intruding? Not at all... Nice to see you. Leave your slippers on, Armi, it looks so homely. You've grown up, Matti. According to biology, a 15-year-old becomes 18 in three years. Biology is certainly correct. Kaarina, you're very pretty. And you are very handsome. Thanks, that's a balm for my old heart. - Please sit down. - Thank you. It was a beautiful wedding. I was quite moved. Deep down, you're actually quite sentimental. I am. - Have a cigarette. - Thank you. Thanks, Kaarina. I see Matti's smoking. Do school rules allow it? No, but a lot of rules get broken nowadays. Jyrki and his bride are going to America on a scholarship trip. Nowadays an architect would take his wife abroad. Former generations would take their secretary. Children, I'd like to have a one to one talk with your father. Go to your rooms please. Sorry, but you know Matti has always been attached to me... ...and he was old enough when we split up to understand things. He still seems bitter... and I can't blame him. Armi, I'm so unhappy about everything that's happened. Let's not talk about it. It's all so comfortable and pleasant here. It's just as it was before. I'd like to look in my old room. The door's locked. Have you wanted to keep it unchanged from then? No, but we had to take a boarder after you left. The Rental Board approved right away. Who's there now? Juhankoski... agriculture advisor. - Juhankoski? - Yes. - Used to be Johansson? - Yes. - I went to school with him. - I know. Pekka Johansson... Fancy Johansson changing to Juhankoski. Your father was Petterson and you became Pekanpaa. That's different. What does an agriculture advisor do in Helsinki? He's also an M.P. and is away from home a lot. I guess he would be. Good that you keep the door locked... ...so he's not coming and going at all hours. As you can see, he came in here unhindered. Hi, this is Juhankoski... has the meeting started already? Fine, I'll be there in 15 minutes. - Hello, may I come in? - Sure. - Sorry, you have a visitor. - Not exactly a visitor. What do you know! If it isn't Mauri Petterson. - It's been a long time. - Good to see you, JOHANSSON. How are things? Are you here often? No, but I guess you're here every day. Many times a day. I feel I'm at home. I thought I recalled you had a country estate. Why does a farmer live in town? I don't have much to do with the estate any more. My eldest son runs it. Are you married? Well, I do have children! In fact I was married, but my wife died prematurely 4 years ago. So, it suits me to live here. Here? I do my best for the country in parliament. - Serving the farmers. - Yes. Dad and Uncle Pekka are like a pair of roosters. We should do something. How Aout some coffee? I don't feel like making coffee for that shameless architect. Don't forget he's my dad. I'll get the raisin cake. - Heavens, I must be on my way. - That's quite alright. Goodbye. At least we get some benefit out of parliament. I'm jealous of any man who's able to be close to you. You were tired of me. You should have resisted... and not given in so easily. Then we wouldn't have split up, and I wouldn't be unhappy. Should I have had you psychoanalysed? Of course... no! Listen, Armi... Couldn't you bring yourself to accept me back? What on earth are you talking about? You're married to someone else. I'll divorce her. She'll agree, if I pay well. Then you'll find a new Babs, and start over again. I'm not that stupid. I've learned my lesson. Is it impossible for you to start again? I think so, now. I don't want to swap my peace and freedom...- ...for the anxiety that all you men, young and old, bring with you. You mean you have no feelings for me? No, I do... of course, Mauri dear. Kaisa ordered coffee. I just thought... Has Uncle Pekka gone? Yes, thank goodness, but I'll gladly have a cup. It was always so homely before when we had coffee together. Before you went crazy. Thanks a lot. I took a cup for myself and Masa as well. Great. It'd be nice to talk to you both. I'll get Masa. Help yourself. Do the kids like Juhankoski? He's pleasant, harmless... always in a good mood. That's often a sign of a retarded intellect. Nowadays I'm usually in a good mood too. Might that be due to Juhankoski? I just came in to say I don't want coffee. Sit down and have a chat. Your matric exams start soon. Yes. What makes you so interested for the first time? This is the first time for your matriculation. Matti obviously can't stand me. I remember how it was here, before you moved out. After that it was lovely, and so peaceful. I'll never forgive you for leaving Mum... ...for some bimbo, and I don't resile from saying that. - Now, really! Matti! - Don't worry, I understand. It'd be bet that I go now. Goodbye, Armi... and children. My regards to Jyrki and his young wife. Goodbye. Aren't you coming to the wedding dinner, daddy? I wasn't invited. You weren't? No, I wasn't. - Oh dear! - So be it. Thanks, Kaisa. Listen, Kaisa, run and buy you mum some flowers. Here... keep the change. Bye bye Kaisa my pet. Bye bye Daddy dear. Daddy! Your top hat! 'Bye. 'Bye. Mauri! How much? You might at least look and say what you think. Delightful. Don't bother me now. What are you doing? Fantastic! I could do it! - I'm not so stupid. - What are you doing? I solved this problem. Matti got it out right, and so did I. Your previous family has started to interest you. I feel guilty about not taking care of them. I'd always believed that you'd paid them well.. All you think about is money. There are other things in life. Like love. Which hasn't been part of our marriage for a while. Right? No, and I can't only blame you for that. Thanks. Anyway, I'll be leaving in the morning. For where? To Stockholm... to see Margaret. - Staying long? - A week. Have a great trip! How much money do you want? You're a generous husband. That's rare. Kaisa, I'll give you a lift. Great, thanks! I think I know where you're going. Are you staying in school? I'm not quite sure yet. Matti got two A-pluses and two As. Did you know? So I heard. Listen... I have a little present for Matti... ...and I don't quite know how I'll give it to him. - Could you give it to him for me? - Sure. - It's probably best I give it to him. - Of course. Tell me later if he liked it. - Can I have a look at it? - Of course. Golly, that's nice! I'm sure Matti will be pleased. And this one's for you. What on earth...? Heavens...! It's wonderful! Enough of that, or we'll have an accident! It's a birthday present as well. - Can I wear it now? - Of course you can. Where are you going for summer, or are you staying in town? Mr Juhankoski has invited us to his estate. We're going to go and have a look the day after tomorrow. Uncle Pekka has been really nice. He bought Matti a graduation present. Silver cuff-links with the Finnish coat of arms. Finnish coat of arms? What poor taste! Typical...! Finnish coat of arms! Stop! You're going past school! Pirkko, forget it. What does a cap matter? Everything in the world... ...especially when you don't have one. You'll get one in autumn. You'll sit again, and pass. I can't be sure. I'll forget everything over summer, and flop again. Don't think like that... be more positive. What does it matter if you don't matriculate? You're fine as you are. As what? Mum says I won't marry well if I haven't been to university. That doesn't make sense. My mum didn't go to uni. And your dad left her. - That wasn't the reason! - Don't get angry! You mustn't worry about no one wanting you... ...should you fail in autumn. Think of Helena, who's been queen bee all her life. Has she had any luck? Boys buzzing around her so that I get angry. You're so noble and wonderful. No one can console me like you can, Matti. What do you think of Juhankoski, Mum? A stately manor. Would you like to spend all summer here? Yes, would you? Well... two or three weeks, during my vacation. Don't you think it's obvious there's no housewife here? Why? The rooms are gloomy, though the furniture's nice. But it's arranged crazily, and the pictures are hung too high. If you were in charge, it'd be different. - In charge? - Deciding. What do you mean? Fix it up, like you do for other people. Oh yes. Couldn't you suggest it to Uncle Pekka? Absolutely not. This is his taste. You can guide a man's taste, if they'll let you. Not always. Goodnight sweetheart. - Sleep tight. - Thanks, you too. I was thinking... What would Dad say? About? About the decor of this place. When does Mrs Pekanpaa return from Stockholm, Sir? No idea. Is that Tekla? This is Pekanpaa again. Has my wife arrived? No? Why are they staying so long? Rang? When are they coming? Fine... thanks. Well, Mauri! Hello. - Greetings from the country. - Thanks. - Please come in! - Thank you. I simply want to know the rules of this game. Game? What do you mean? You know very well. When I come to see you, happy and hopeful... I hear you're running out to see Juhankoski. With Kaisa. And what business is it of yours, anyway? Can't I see whoever I want? Of course. But I thought you were more discriminating... ...than to fall for the first man to come along. Do you really think I'm such a little girl? But the main thing you can't deny... Tell me now if you plan to marry that hick? Has he proposed? He has! I can tell! So why ask? Why do you have to remarry? - You remarried. - Yes, I was crazy. But I always thought you were more sensible. - And at your age! - You were just as old. And I'm not taking someone 20 years younger. Thank you. What do you see in that guy? Do you think he could become a minister? He belongs to the Agrarian Party and could well become a minister. Armi Pekanpaa, would like to be a minister's wife. I do not aspire to such an uncertain honor. What do you see in him? He's a calm, reliable and confident man... And he doesn't have any young, beautiful, flirtatious secretaries around him. - But buxom milkmaids. - That he hasn't fallen for. Don't be so sure. You never know when a man gets into the hands of a beautiful, coquettish woman. That's true. You can never be sure of men. Well... Where did he go? Who? That... fertilizer! If you mean Mr Juhankoski, he's gone to parliament. Fine! Mauri! Mauri! Don't do anything stupid, if you're thinking of seeing him. Me? That's why there are 200 of them. Howdy! - Haven't seen you around here before. - This is the first time. I want to talk to you. Come down here where we won't be disturbed. What are your intentions regarding my wife? She's not your wife. Don't quibble! My ex-wife. A good woman. I'd like to see Armi as the housewife in my estate. No more no less? She's a lovely person... ...and I'm a widower and she's free. You surely can't have anything against her remarrying? That would be a joke, coming from you. A big joke. I'd hope that she's have better luck next time. Understood. And though I mightn't be as sophisticated as you... ...I'm not chasing someone 25 years younger. That sort may be warmer in bed for a while... ...but at my age, a man wants something else... Comradeship and a peaceful life together. You don't need to preach to me. Keep that for parliament. But you're just a man like anyone else. Maybe, but I'd never leave a woman like Armi. But it's good you did... Now I can get her. Don't be so sure. Don't forget that old loves never really die. Home at last, Ma'am, looking so smart. How's it been here? Good. Mr Pekanpaa hasn't been home much. Has he had visitors? One evening he did. Two whiskey glasses got broken. Do you want lunch? I'm not sure. Hi, Mauri! Greetings from Stockholm. You were there a long time. Have you missed me? That would be sweet. How was Margaret? Margaret? Oh yes! She's wonderful. We went to the theatre, restaurants, dances. And shopping of course. I spent like crazy. How do you like the dress? Isn't it stylish? Lina asked about lunch. I'm eating at the club. Don't you want to eat with your wife, who's been away so long? Don't pretend. Very well... ...we'll stop pretending. Shall we get down to brass tacks? Wouldn't it be better if we divorced? You go back to your previous wife. And you go to...? That's my business. You think I believe about "Margaret"? You have a guy. So? Do you think I haven't noticed... ...you longing for your old family? And don't you realise how I curse myself... ...for leaving them so carelessly, for you? If only Armi would take me back... You'd be off, running. Is that what's eating you? That's easy to fix. And then you all come to the estate for summer. I can come for 2 or 3 weeks... ...then I'm in town. I'm getting a job. Not to mention looking after Pirkko. That's none of your business. - Thanks for coffee, I have to go. - Where to? Need you ask? To meet Pirkko! To buy shoes... I heard them on the phone. Pirkko can't even do that without Matti. Stop teasing Matti all the time. Phone for you, Mum. An affected woman's voice. Good morning. Yes, some idea. Yes... Why not? When? In 10 minutes? Very well, yes. You're welcome. Goodbye. Armi, I'll drive you to work. Thanks, but I'm not going yet. I have a visitor coming. Who? Mrs Pekanpaa number 2. What the hell is she doing here? Is she angry because Dad has been here? Or does she want to ask how her husband should be handled? I don't know what she wants. But let me meet her alone. We'll leave you to it. She might put on airs, but she'll meet her match. I want to see her. Is she such a vamp as everyone says? Come on, can't you see Mum's nervous? I must get changed. - Mrs Pekanpaa? - Yes. Come in. Well, Mrs Pekanpaa... Funny talking to someone with the same name. You don't mind my using my first husband's name? - For the children's sake. - No, I understand. I came to talk about your husband. You mean your husband, of course. Whatever. But he's not our shared husband. - That wouldn't be proper. - No, it wouldn't. I'm sure you feel bitter about me. Well... not any more. If I'd been a bit smarter, I wouldn't be sitting here now. But you're smarter now? A lot smarter. But I was terrible young. - 25, my Hus... your husband said. - Something like that. I just got swept off my feet when such a stylish guy... ...started taking an interest in me. You were surprised? Absolutely. There were other young girls in the office. When he chose me as his secretary... ...and took me to London and Paris... A girl would have to have a very strong character... ...to resist that sort of thing. And you didn't? No. Only when it was really necessary. Anyway, he divorced you, and married me. And here we are now. Exactly. Here we are now. And you should be happy. I was, almost up to now. But now, it's like... ...that I'm in love for real, and... With someone else? Not your husband? It's probably not something that I should come here and talk about. You see, Ma'am, before I fell in love with someone else... ...I was really worried about our age difference. Up to now it didn't matter so much... ...because he tried hard to act young... But lately he's stopped trying, and sort of fallen apart. I'm thinking that in 20 years he'll be over 70... ...and I'll be only 40 something. Your way of calculating is a bit strange. Whatever. He'll be an old fogey then... ...and I'll be in my best years. The mere thought appalls me. You should have thought of that 4 years ago. It's not the sort of thing you think about. Besides, I've given him the best 4 or 5 years of my life. When Mauri has done his duty, Mauri may leave. Why are you telling me this? Because the man I'm in love with is a foreigner. He's a Chilean diplomat and live in Stockholm. Now he's been transferred to Rio de Janeiro... ...and he wants me to go with him as his wife. I could go there and leave Mauri to get a divorce. But Blasco's family are strict Catholics and would never accept that. I want to show up in Rio with fresh papers... ...so I'm not the cause of the divorce. Understand? I'm starting to understand. You want to have grounds for a divorce. Exactly. You're very intelligent. I don't know how that might work. Mauri has no one new, has he? No, but he's still stuck on his ex. He still loves you. He's told me himself. - You have a plan? - Yes. Look, it would simply go like this... He comes here, and I surprise you both. I, and a neutral witness. But Mauri has a right to come here... To see his children, for example. I don't mean right here, I mean in the bedroom. You could be lying sick in bed...- Mauri is sitting on the edge of the bed... ...You rush in with witnesses, and that's it? Exactly. To make it more credible, Mauri should be in pyjamas. Wouldn't a dressing-gown be enough? Pyjamas would be better. I acknowledge your plan, but unfortunately it's impossible. Why would I sacrifice myself for you, once again? First, going along with a divorce... Then taking part in some farce... ...so you can get a divorce and remarry? Why should I help you with anything at all? To get your husband back! Who said I wanted him back? But... I thought that... You thought incorrectly. Now that you've got him, you're welcome to him. Anyway, now you know the situation. Think about it. I must say that you're uncommonly naive... ...and extremely thoughtless. Sorry... someone at the door. Hi, Kaarina. Is Mummy still home? Yes, but she has a visitor. - What are you doing here? - I could ask the same. - This is my home. - Well, well! Happy birthday, Armi. What are you talking about? I haven't forgotten your birthday. It's the 1st of next month. No it's marked in my calendar... "A's birthday." Maybe it should say "B's birthday". I was born in September. A Virgo, as Mauri well knows. My daughter Kaarina... Mrs Pekanpaa. Could you put these in a vase, dear? Lovely roses. Thanks anyway, Mauri. How about we sit down. It's embarrassing to sit like this... Between A and B? It's been nice getting to know your wife. We had an interesting little discussion. Presumably the subject was my insignificance. Is it improper for me to ask the outcome? That has to remain your wife's and my secret. I think it most unseemly for you to have secrets between you. Almost immoral. Well, I'll clear the air... ...so my presence doesn't disturb your virtuous feelings. Goodbye, Ma'am. And Mauri... How ever could you have left such an intelligent woman ... ...and nice comfortable family for the likes of Babs? Is Mr Juhankoski available please? No? Where has he gone? To the barber's? Thanks very much. Mr Lund rang about the house alterations. He wants the middle wall removed... and have a large arched opening instead. Tear all the walls down. I'll be back in the morning. A shave... Howdy! Well I never... Hi! - How are things? - Same as usual. And you? Just peace and love. Good for you. You still have thick hair. No sign of baldness. I live a healthy life. Yours is thick too... Just a little... A little Grey... I know. Listen, you weren't angry yesterday... ...when I spoke harshly to you? I know... sometimes people lose control of what they say. It happens. It's good that I met you by chance... ..and heard you say that, because it's not nice... ...for old friends to fall out over something like that. That's very true. Why don't you drop in to our place this evening? We could talk about old times. Around 8? OK? Thanks, that would be nice...- ...but there's a session this evening. But it's not that important. Look forward to seeing you. But don't say anything about it to them back home... To Armi. Understand? Of course not. Fine. Is that little Miss Pekanpaa? Hello! - Yes, it is. Hello. - Why are you here? I'm meeting a friend who lives here. But you must come and see us. Thanks, but I can't. Your dad's not at home. Come on, there's something I'd like to show you. But just for a few minutes. I only ever wore this dress once. I'm sure it would suit you. Try it on. It's very nice, but I don't know... Try it on... I'd be happy for you to have it. I have so many, and I'm moving south. Is Daddy moving too? No, he's staying here. Come on, try it on. Or try it at home. Your dad paid for it. Mum wouldn't be happy about it. Well... Perhaps it was just a pretext to get you to come in. You're very like your father. That's what Mum says when I irritate her. - Chocolate? - Ooh, thank you. You know, Kaarina... That was your name? I feel very guilty about... ...involuntarily taking your father, your good father away from you. I'm sure you're all angry with me. I'd understand that. It's not your fault that Daddy fell in love with you. If he was in love with me, it was for a very short time. He's never stopped loving your mother. You don't believe me, but it's true. He isn't happy with me, and that saddens me. Poor old Dad is pretty thoughtless. Didn't you realise that when he first started flirting with you? I regret the decision I made when I was young. I'd like to make up for it. Thanks for the clothes, but... I'm not referring to that. You're the apple of Daddy's eye, aren't you? I don't know. If I was, I always would've been. Daddy has managed without me for 5 years. I know how much he's missed you. And I'm sure your daddy would move back home... ...if you asked him nicely and gave him a big hug. People can't just go backwards and forwards like that! Jumping from wife to wife would be crazy. And all the lawyers and courts and stuff. There are a few formalities. What about you? It doesn't matter about me. The main thing is that your daddy is happy again. I think it's supposed to be you who's to make him happy. The four of us tried for years and years. I want you to try once more. Our feelings have cooled somewhat. But I'm sure your mum misses her husband. Mummy has lots of admirers. She could marry tomorrow if she wanted to. Is there anyone in particular? I couldn't reveal her secrets. I have to go. I'm expected. Goodbye. Can you believe she offered me her old clothes?! That's the limit! They were like new. Really nice. - Why not take them? - Of course I couldn't. I thanked her politely but coldly. What does she look like? The sort of vamp you see in a movie. I can't understand how Daddy fell for her. Not when your mum's so clever and stylish. Isn't that true?! Do you know... ...I read that old men reach an age... ...when that want young girls. Yuck! Horrible. Watch your dad... Dad's so fat, but if he tried... ...I'd hate him for the rest of my life. I can't hate Daddy. I just feel sorry for him. He always looks so sad. Hi, this is Pekanpaa. Could you do me a little favour? Call me at home this evening at 8.30. And ignore the fact that I'll talk a lot of nonsense. Just an innocent joke. Remember, exactly 8.30 Fine. Thanks a lot. Did it ring? Was that for me? It was Karhu from the office. Oh... we're having a visitor, after 8 o'clock. An old school chum... a good friend. I'd like you to be really really sweet with him... ...like you can when you want to. Try this... It's strong! Just what do you mean, by "really really sweet"? Be just like you were when I fell in love with you. Act a bit coquettishly. It wouldn't hurt if he took a fancy to you. In your presence? And you won't mind? Yes, I've become tolerant. I don't get jealous at all any more. And he should take a fancy to me. - Yes. - Why? He has been angry with me... ...because I left my wife and married you. And he's not the only one. What business is it of his? None at all. But old pals can be like that. Particularly if they were fond of your first wife. Was that the case? Yes. But I'm sure he'll understand my feelings when he sees you. What feelings? How I fell madly in love with you. That I was so... ...So stupid as to marry me? Let's not start bickering. Not this evening. Be like it used to be. Tell me... what's all this about? Nothing at all... But it's very important he gets a charming impression of you. He's a member of parliament And the rumours are flying around parliament. Good. Babs... here he is. Hi... Come on in! Glad you could come. Take off your coat. So nice of you. Come into our humble abode! So nice that you came. Well... this is very impressive. A young modern wife wants a modern home. Please sit down. These are like old necking sofas! Hard to get out of them! I'm not mad about them either. Sit here, it's more comfortable. What strange pictures! Sorry, but my taste is more to Von Wright's fighting roosters. ...or cocks, or whatever they are. I admit I also admire that picture. Two strong males against each other. Combat, strength, life! But look at that one. That's a Capicho which could be valuable. Is this what's called non-figurative? I can't figure out what it's supposed to be. Nothing specific. It represents an emotional feeling, probably jealousy. I think it's more likely to represent a belch! That's a good one! How about a snort while we're waiting for my wife? Cheers, Pekka! Glad you could come. That sure was strong! I can't really handle strong drink. I can get so tired I fall asleep. It's not dangerous. After all... "He who sleeps does not sin". How are things in parliament? Spendthrifts and dairymaids for MPs. Here she is. I'd like you to meet my old school chum, Juhankoski. Good evening, and welcome. This is my Babs. Here's your drink. Cheers, Mr Juhankoski. - Welcome. - Thank you. Let's sit down. This thing's not alive, is it? No, just my Bimbo. Children like them. My wife is almost a child. I'm often mistaken for her father. It's not funny, but Babs takes it like a trooper. Right, sweetheart? Do you have children? Four of them. Cheers! Now we'll have a quiet and pleasant evening. If we get ourselves buried in school reminiscences... ...Babs will drag us back to the present. Excuse me. Hello... Pekanpaa. Who? Oh, Karhu! Fine. What do you want? A telegram... It came at last? That must be answered right away. Sure yes, you're not up on it. Come there? Hell no, I can't. I have guests. What?! Well, I'll just have to come in. I'll come right away. See you. Dear oh dear! Who was that? Where are you going? Sorry. The office got a telegram from France. We've been waiting for it all day. It has to be answered. - I'll have to drive to the office. - Maybe I should... Not at all! You just stay right there. I'll only be away a matter of minutes. Babs will keep you company... Won't you darling? 'Bye... see you soon. He's always like this.. The office seems so important that he has to rush there... ...though there'd be no female secretary there right now. Just as well. Cheers, Mr Juhankoski. So Mauri has some big projects? I think so, but I don't really know... ...since I no longer work in his office. Of course... you were his private secretary. That often ends up with marrying the boss. At least in American movies. I believe you have a beautiful estate. I have over 100 under cultivation. I used to have 300. - 300 what? - Hectares. Before, I had 300 hectares. But I had to give 200 away. 200 hectares. That was very charitable of you. What? To give so much land to the needy. That might be the right word. The land went for a song. I guess you have cows? Of course I have cows... But in a cowshed built for 100 I only have 40 milkers. Cows, that is. It would be nice to see your estate. Ask Mauri to drive you. It's only 100 k from here... kilometers. It wouldn't be suitable in summer. Mauri's family, Armi and the kids, his former family... ...are staying there over summer. It wouldn't be suitable Do you know Mrs Armi Pekanpaa? Of course. I've known her a long time. I board with them... in Mauri's old room. Cheers! Mrs Pekanpaa is a delightful woman, don't you agree? Yes. One of the most delightful women I know. A lot of people were stunned when Mauri left her. Sorry. I don't mean to be hurtful to you. I was also amazed when I heard what Mauri had done. But now that I've seen you, I can understand it. You're a delightful woman in your way... And Armi is in hers. Cheers.. Thank you. You're a real gentleman. I feel you may have had a crush on Armi. I don't know... She appeals to me a lot, I admit that. Enough that you want to Mary her? Go on... admit it! Why should I deny it? I'm not craving forbidden fruit. Does Mauri know? Yes, and he doesn't like it. He scolded me about it, yesterday! But I don't care! Good! Why should you, about that old goat?! Cheers, Mr Pekankoski. Juhankoski... not Pekankoski. Pekka Juhankoski, not Jukka Pekankoski. You're a captivating man... ...and a bit of a Romeo, I'll bet! I think you're trying to seduce me! You're one helluva sweet and beautiful woman! I quite understand Mauri. And you're a big flatterer, Pekankoski, Juhankoski... Jukka or Pekka, no matter. How about we say... ...that this evening, I am Juhanpaa and not Pekankoski! What would be better? Jukka or Pekka? We can say that you are Jukka Pekka for me... and I am Babs for you. Cheers, Babs! I'm already starting to hope that Mauri doesn't come back. I'm quite sure Mauri can't keep himself away. Tell me about farming, Jukka Pekka. My mind is a total blank on that subject. You're being awfully secretive. Why do I have to come with you at this hour? Where are you taking me How's my friend Juhankoski? Fine, as far as I know.. Don't you live near here? Sure do. I live here, and I want you to come up. - That's impossible. - Please, Armi. What would your wife say? Let me tell you something.. Juhankoski is at our place. While I fetched you, I left my wife with him to keep him company. So, a bit of intrigue! Not at all... You can come up, when you know that my wife... ..as well as your admirer Pekka, are there. Armi, you're not a petite bourgeoise are you? Whatever! Now we'll have a mixture with a punch! It's called "Pekka and Babs' Sensation"... ...and the effect is devastating. Jukka Pekka, come here, quickly! You sit down there... and I'll sit here. Sit on my knee, and sing for me...! - Cheers, Jukka Pekka. - Cheers! Come on in. Kiss me. But Babs...! Pekka, what's the meaning of this?! I see...! Armi, don't leave. Armi ... What the hell! "Babs' and Pekka's Sensation". What the damned hell! I never would have believed that. Never! Babs has always been a bit easy-going... But that Juhankoski... My old friend and schoolmate Pekka Juhankoski... You can't even trust your best friend any more. This Johansson might seem nice... ...but he's the clumsy type. It seems that men who are used to living with one woman... ...lapse at the first good opportunity... ...while more experienced men have become clever and stable. How can I put it... They know the deeper values of life better. I live there. Please stop. You're not angry with me, are you? Good night. Can I call you in the morning? Stockholm, Grand Hotel. Urgent call to Mr da Gama. Da Gama ... G for George I promised it today. It's to be picked up this afternoon. Is there much left to do? Rouva Aho is finishing the weaving. We'll take the other one tomorrow. I'll come this afternoon. Goodbye. Good morning, Armi. Good morning, Pekka. Beautiful day today. Yes, it is. Listen, I want to talk about last night. You mustn't think... You have to believe that I was lured into a trap. Of course. You see, just before you came in... ...that hussy jumped onto my lap and started kissing me. Didn't you see that I dropped her? No, but I would have really liked to. You realise it wasn't very nice for me to have to witness that scene. Don't you realise now, it wasn't MY scene?? You can't believe I'd be someone... ...who'd have another man's wife in his arms? I'm quite sure you're not like that. So long as you believe it, it's OK. It's all OK. Forget it. I am so happy that you take it all so sensibly. And you know, Armi... I resolved... ...to speak seriously with you, to ask you to... Excuse me, I just remembered I need to talk to Tekla about breakfast... Can you get the door? It'll be Kaisa having forgotten her key. - So you're here! - And you too! You have a hide, coming here! Why? This is my home. Half, anyway. - I want an explanation! - And I, from you. What was the idea of ambushing me? Ambush? What an idea! Don't pretend... I understand it all. You lure me to your apartment.... Lured you? You came of your own accord! Then you poured some fiery hooch into my glass... Hooch? It was expensive liquor. You should have become a barman. Then pretend to go to the office, to fetch Armi... ...having briefed your hussy to jump into my arms... ...just as you're coming in. - What are you saying, chum? I'm no chum of yours. I can't believe my ears! Could you be so mean? You're quite contemptible. It makes me very angry. To drag an upright innocent man into your machinations. - What good did it do you? - Yes, what?! All's fair in love and war. And a war is about to break out between us. You attack an innocent man and say you've been attacked. So I have! My interests are being sabotaged. Can you get the door again, Pekka? Peak-hour traffic here. Good morning, "Jukka Pekka". Babs, don't go in there. What are YOU doing here? Probably about the same matter as you. Good morning. How long are you here? H... how long...? Wh... what...? He stutters when he has a guilty conscience. Four years ago, he stuttered a lot. I can believe that. Has he confessed? It was a boyish prank. Mauri's always had a weakness for pranks. A smart woman like you is not deceived by childish tricks. Mr Juhankoski is totally innocent. I arranged a scene, when I saw that Mauri wanted... ...Mr Juhankoski's irreproachable character.. ...to be sullied forever in your eyes.. You swine! You took the word right out of my mouth, Mr Pekankoski. I mean, Juhankoski. So Mauri, have you nothing to say? Quite a lot... to you. And I've something to tell Juhankoski. And I you. Why did Babs come and tell of it all? Because I'm about to fly to Stockholm... ...and on to Rio de Janeiro. - What's behind that? - Blasco da Gama. My next husband... Blasco Cervantes Eduardo da Gama. Alias "Margaret", my English girlfriend. Babs and Blasco. Goes together. Off you go! You're not heartbroken? I'd be lying if I said I was.. - But you're leaving my husband... - Yes, Mauri. Yes. He can get himself a divorce.. Blasco doesn't care. He wants me with him... ...and can sort it out with his family. Well... goodbye everybody. And I wish you especially, the very best of luck. I think you could have little boy Mauri back now... ...a bit quieter and better-behaved. And that you can thank me for. So... hasta la vista! Mauri, you shouldn't go with her, at least to the shuttle bus? I'll take to the airport, but I'll be back... old chum! Hasta la vista! This is all starting to get completely beyond me. But now that we're alone... finally alone... I can express what I've felt for a long time. Armi, my dear Armi... Damnation! They're ringing me again from parliament. Ringing? I'm on my way. The bells of hell are ringing... They even ring here. I have to race into parliament, but I'll be back. Then we'll discuss everything. - Hi, was Daddy here? - Yeah. What's eating Uncle Pekka? Tekla said it stank of alcohol in his room. If Uncle Pekka is a drunk, I don't like him. Say, Mummy... If you say yes to him, demand a sobriety guarantee. "Say yes to him"? Where did you get that from? Start setting the table. It's obvious he's sweet on you. Tekla said he'd become part of the household. Would you give your blessing? I'm not sure. Daddy remarried. Yes, but I know he's not happy. I feel like crying... ...when I think of his Grey hair, wrinkles, and shaky hands. Don't exaggerate... He's not all that old. And his hands don't shake. It sounds crazy to talk about love at your ages. - Have I done that? - No, you haven't. But there's been love in the air around here lately. Love is for young people. Though The Readers Digest writes about the sex appeal of Grey temples... ...and that age doesn't stop love. But it does. Don't laugh! You've been a bit flirtatious and given Uncle Pekka ideas. Tell me... Would you take Daddy back if he asked really nicely? Isn't dinner ready yet? Pirkko and I were going to go and pick wildflowers. Is that what it's called nowadays? - Can I come too? - Stick to kids your own age. Careful I don't jump out from behind a bush... ...just when you and Pirkko...! You go set the table! Kaisa's a pain nowadays. Girl's are impossible at her age. Tell me, Matti... Have you also thought that him in there and... I...? Who? Pekka Juhankoski and me. What do you mean? That he might want to marry me. Marry you? Why? Why would he want to marry you? - Are you planning to? - How would you feel? Why would you want to remarry... especially with him? He's a good, upright man. I've nothing against him as a man, but... I can't explain. When you've been married to someone, even though he was like Dad... So, is it alright? At your age? You should have done it younger. Stop talking about my age! Anyone 'd think I was 100. Sorry. Matti, it won't be long before you and Kaarina are married... ...and I'll be all alone here. Finding an apartment's impossible these days. We'd move in here, of course. Thanks very much, but I'd rather live alone. But why is Juhankoski the only choice? Who then? Nobody else has proposed. Why the hell couldn't Dad have been faithful? It's obvious you two should have stayed together. Matti, what would you say... ...if your Dad's bit of fluff wanted to leave him... ...and he wanted to move back in here? For God's sake, say no! Juhankoski would be better? I guess so, if you MUST have some old man here. So, Babs, everything's under control. My lawyer is organising a divorce that will be smooth and quick. Here's some cash and travelers cheques. You really are sweet! - Do you think I'm doing the right thing? - Absolutely. You are going to a new exciting life that you were meant for. I thank you for all the good days that we actually had... ...and I wish you all the best with all my heart. Mauri, this is not easy. You'll be alright. We have to go. Hi, Matti... How are you going? Madame. Why flowers again? This is a day to celebrate. The problem's gone. What problem? Stop tormenting me. I'll bet you're bursting with curiosity. Mrs Pekanpaa number 2 is now floating through the air... ...and will be out of our sight for evermore. I hope. I see. I see?! Is that all you can say at a moment like this... "I see"? I'm listening. Good! Well then... I move home again... to my old room... ...as a boarder, for the time being. No need to register with the Rental Board. - And Juhankoski? - Has to move out. He can have my present apartment. So everything's clear. Mauri Pekanpaa, you make a rough sketch... ...and assume I'll accept it without further discussion. The final plans must be approved... ...by that first wife, who you dumped... ...before you can walk in, saying "I'm coming home..." ...and fetch your pyjamas and toothbrush from the last one. First you hurt and offend your family, me and the children... ...by having a relationship with a scatterbrained slut. You force me into a divorce, and marry her... ...and when you're tired of her, or she's tired of you... ...you remember your old Armi, and you come to her... ...sure of victory, with laughing eyes, and say... "I'm moving back home." And that's that, right? But all this spring, I've believed... All you ever believe in is what you think's best for you. What if it's no good for me? Are you planning to marry that Juhan-thingummy? All you ever think about is marriage. I'm getting bored to death. What if I wanted to live alone in my old age? What do you say to that? Alright. Don't think I want to force myself on you. But I will say that you deceived me. I deceived you? Haven't you let me think that you were willing to have me back? Now that you've got everything... I've got? Don't repeat me! Now that you've got everything, and I'm alone again... ...so you coldly show me the door. I'd never have believed it. Mauri, where are you going? Do you care where an injured dog goes... ...to lick his wounds... and die? Daddy's here! Great! Are you going to stay for lunch? Mummy hasn't invited me. Probably because we're only having herring and oatmeal porridge. I love herring, and I eat oatmeal porridge. Doctor's orders. - Have you been to the doctor? - Many times. I have gastric ulcers that give me hell. It's all due to worry and stress. They've got worse lately. Look how poorly Daddy's looking. We have to look after you. Your new wife can't. No, it'd be very difficult for her... She's on her way to Brazil... for good! To Brazil?!? Hurrah! Now it's all OK! Daddy can come back, can't he, Mummy? He can have the spare keys. Can I? Staying for lunch? Obviously. You'll get the keys sooner or later. Think so? What if she changes the locks? There isn't a lock that you couldn't open... A naughty boy like you!
