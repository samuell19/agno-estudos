There's a tale around these parts, one they tell on nights like tonight, Halloween night, of an ancient evil that lives in an old barn in the middle of nowhere. One night, a group of kids just like you, they stumbled on that barn and they awoken that evil. Then one by one the creatures that they unleashed slaughtered, dragged them into the darkness. The last two boys of the group, they fought the monsters and they tried to send them back to the blackest pits of fiery hell where they came from. But before they could, the entire barn burst into flames! Now, nobody knows what truly happened that night, but one lone survivor who made it out alive. Now, some say that those things are still out there, out here waiting to be unleashed again and finish what they started. Mwha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Have you ever heard of the old railroad incident? The one where all those workers got killed by that runaway train? And they say, when you go down to the off cemetery late at night, they could still hear the clamoring of them working on the tracks, just like they were on that fateful day. - Zombie railroad. - So, really, how did they do it? How did they awaken the monsters? I think that'd be a good question for our fire-starting badge expert and special guest of the evening, Scout Master Henry. Thank you, Scout Master Henry. Which by the way, this rendition of that legend is his story, and also thank you so much for finding this campsite. Oh, you can call me preacher. In order to awaken them, you have to knock on the barn doors and say "Trick or treat" three times. Oh, so kind of like that game we played while the troop leader was setting up camp? It's exactly like that game. Wait, what? Okay, boys, I think that's enough of the Halloween spooky stories for one night. Boo! I'll let you guys finish this bag of marshmallows, if you promise to call it a night. Help me. What happened? I knew you would come back to me, I now know it could've been any barn, all I had to do was to seal the markings in blood to bring you home. I'd know now, but that little bitches that got away too. The, the newspapers claim she's right here in this town. Soon, we will reclaim what this rightfully ours. Okay, listen up, ladies. It's the start of our fall semester, and what does that mean? Our Annual Sorority Fall Fundraiser. That's right, it's also the Gamma Tau psi Halloween Bash, thanks to some certain sisters, who were caught giving lap dances during our haunted house last year on campus, they will no longer allow the event to take place here. As funny as you may all think this is, it puts us in quite a predicament with the Fall Fundraiser. We can always have a car wash. Or how about a wet t-shirt contest? That's true, it doesn't matter what the event is anyway, the guys only come out to support two things. What about a bake sale? A Battle of the Bands competition? What about a kissing booth? Uh, yeah, have you seen some of the nerds on campus? There's no way I'm gonna just kiss any guy that pays a couple bucks. So, you won't do that, but you'll do it on the weekends for free? - Ah! - Ah. Okay, getting back on track, I would like to make a motion to take our annual haunt into town and relaunch Halloween. An off-campus haunt? That would make a lot of sense. I did read where the mayor's been receiving a lot of complaints over the past two years and has finally decided to lift the trick or treat ban this year. Okay, Heather, go on, I'm listening. Well, as all of you are aware, my younger brother, Josh Harper, is one of the teens that went missing a couple years ago on Halloween night, thus helping Sarah Barnhart, aka psycho preacher bitch, to put the ax on Halloween in town. I, for one, feel that Sam Daniels and my brother were the heart and soul of trick or treating in this town with their haunted garage and I think it would be fitting to pay tribute to them with this opportunity. Sounds like a big undertaking, you think you can do it in six weeks? - I think so. - Sister Michelle? I know that we were all obligated to help out with the fundraiser anyway, but I think what Heather's trying to do is a great idea. And if she's willing, I'd love to partner up and to see it all the way through. You do? That's a little surprising. - Why? - I think Sister Lisa and probably all of us, are just a little shocked that you'd wanna be involved with something that's so close to the whole... I get it, I do, but you don't have to tiptoe around it. I appreciate it, believe me, but I'm okay with it. I think on a large scale, Sam and Josh's haunted house would be the perfect way to kickstart Halloween and get back a Barnhart. And that's something I can totally get behind, and I think that Sam and Josh would too. Okay, does anyone disagree with this motion? So, it's decided. Heather and Michelle will both lead this year's fundraiser. Don't let the sorority down, ladies, I have very high hopes for this one. All right, if there are no more questions to be asked, then this week's meeting is over. Thank you so much for agreeing to help out with this project. Uh, I actually wanted to ask you about it before I made the motion, but are you sure you're okay with this? I mean, given the circumstances, I don't wanna trigger anything for you. No, no, absolutely not. No, I, I mean, I've been in Gamma Tau like two years and we've never gotten the chance to know each other. I, but I just, I hoped we missed talking to each other because of schedules and not, and not because of... No, of course not. I, I really hope I haven't come off that way, if I have, I didn't mean to. No, I, I just, I never, I never know what people think. I, I can only assume they're like, "Why did she survive?" No, the way I look at it is, at least there was a lucky one. Hey, sorry to interrupt. Michelle, could I borrow a dress for a date tonight? - Oh, absolutely. - Thanks. Um, so, how should we get started? Well, we need a theme, actors, which we'll use most of the girls here to draw in the guys, food, we gotta do concessions, promotions, but most importantly, we gotta find a new location. It sounds exciting. Oh, I have a membership at the video store, do you wanna swing by and grab some horror flicks for the weekend? Damage our young, innocent minds. Us head bangers. 'Tis the season, fall is in the air. Are you ready? - Yeah. - But now, it's where you get to call in, let's go to our first call. Hello caller, what's your name and where are you calling from? Hello, my name is Sarah and I am calling from Helen's Valley Community Church. Ah, yes, Mrs. Barnhart, I don't want to have to cut you off. Five teenagers disappeared on Halloween night, on their way to a rock concert you promoted on your show... What is this, the 12th, 13th time that you've called into my show? Why don't you just do it to my face? Halloween night, my church, we will be having a town meeting in the basement to have Halloween reband. And I will be there. You heard it here, for the first time ever, I will be taking the show on the road and now a word from our sponsor. ♪ He's Dr. Rock ♪ All right, we're clear. Dewey, who let that whack job through the line again? Seriously, guys. We'll be right back following these commercials. Bro, but speaking seriously, have you been on network producers? Having a location there, it's not gonna fly going live. I already thought about that, Tony. All we gotta do is prerecord the regular part of the show, in advance, then we shoot the town hall meeting and edit it carefully, broadcast it later to show just what a loony tune that lady is, right? You with me? Yo boss, I'm with you, man. Anything you need to make happen, let's do it. Oh, bingo, so what are some of your favorite sub genres? Actually, I really like a good monster movie, but one of my favorites is "Sleepover party Slaughter Fest." Dude, right on, that's what I'm talking about. I never would've guessed. Ahoy, land-lover, welcome to the Tape Deck. Hi Charlie, Michelle, this is Charlie. Ahoy, nice to meet you. We're dressing up a bit early for Halloween. If me wants to keep me job, me best wear my pirate's garb all day. Is, is that you real accent or you pulling me arm? 'Tis not but fun to do nonetheless. Okay, that's really stupid. No, no, no, keep it going. - I really like your costume. - Seriously? This isn't my actual style. So I, if you think I'm cool because of that, I, I'm sorry, I, I have to let you down. So, what brings you two scallywags down here? Uh, well, Heather thought we should do some research for taking the sorority haunt off-campus. Uh, uh-huh, yeah, the lap dance incident. I heard you guys were banned from campus. Yep, so now we're off to find a new location. You don't know of any houses for rent, do you? Not off hand, my uncle, he, ah, house is... My uncle might be able to help, I could give him a call and see. He has this empty building, it's, uh, just up over the hill from the drive-in. Perfect. Yeah, now if you'll excuse us, we have a stack of videos and popcorn calling our names. Oh, wait, wait, I, I didn't catch your name. Michelle. Michelle, I guess I'll see you on the return. Hey buddy, these are four for 00 cents, right? I'm on my break. Thanks, prick. Well, like I said, it's nice this old building being used for something since the family doesn't come down here much anymore. Now, it's got power, but you gotta make sure the gas is in the generator at all times, otherwise you're gonna lose it. Awesome, thank you so much for taking the time to meet with us. Um, is it okay if we just take a couple days to think it over and... Actually, how much is it to rent this space for the event? Well, Charlie said y'all doing this for a fundraiser? Yeah. Well, you can consider the space my donation. Are you serious? That's great. Thank you. Now you probably won't see much of me. I got plenty to keep me busy all up in the house. Just a little bit of a warning, there's a well in the basement, it's about a 40 foot drop, spring dried up long time ago. So, if you fell down in it, you're a goner. I guess for safety's sake, I should probably go ahead and board it up before I head on out this evening. - Great. - Great. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Ma'amers. I am so sorry, I had no idea it was a barn. If I had I never would've brought you. - Stop, it's, it's perfect. - Really? It's exactly what Sam and Josh always wanted, a haunted house in an actual barn. Perfect. Let's see. Happy Halloween! No, no! No! Yellow, Sheriff Cooper speaking, what can I do for? Coop! Just the person I needed to talk to. Mayor, how are you? Well, I'd be doing a lot better if it wasn't for a certain problematic individual in this town. She apparently found some flyers about a haunted house being put on by one of the sororities. And it's the same night as the town hall Halloween protest meeting. I heard about that, a haunted house of the old Douglas Slaughter property, very spooky sounding. How can I help? Would you, would you mind staying nearby the location that night and, and just keep an eye on things? You know, that way I can, I can at least tell her it's being overseen. Sure, yeah, I'll patrol the area, maybe swing by the old drive-in, you know, check out the event from a distance, let the kids have a little fun. Thanks Coop, I appreciate it. I think this is the last tree on the street. Yeah, and I think this is the last house to inform about the haunt too. Come in, Michelle told me you'd be stopping by. Oh, oh, please sit down. Dad, you remember Heather? And this is her friend, Michelle. They are going to pick up some things, I'll be right back. Uh-huh. I guess there's something I don't know about? Yeah, sort of. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. My Lord, is that little Heather? It is. How have you been, Walter? Oh, now you know it's Walt. Well, I can't complain, the old ticker's still kicking. How's your mother? She's doing better, still has her good days and bad days. Been a rough few years between losing dad and Josh. Sure, well we can all understand that. You know Michelle, fun fact, Walter here used to work in the mines in his younger days. He has a lot of really great stories, stories that helped Sam scare all the neighborhood kids. So, you're the legendary grandfather? Well, I've been known to spin a yarn or two in my time, but I don't think that's what you two girls are here for, is it? No, we'd love to hear one from the man himself. Well, there is one story that I've never really told to another living soul. As you say, I worked for the coal company back in the 1030s, end of the '30s. They settled me with this new guy, kid called Mitchell. I remember he turned up for work his first day in a pair of them smart coveralls, name tag on his chest. I guess the kid was real proud. Now, the townspeople were complaining about the smell of sulfur in the water, so they send Mitchell and me out to take a look see, way out, back of beyond. And so it's not to cause a stir in the neighborhood, they decided to send us out in the middle of the night and of all nights in the year they could have chosen to send us, they chose Halloween. Strange thing is, when we got to the well, there was this old scarecrow on a pole right next to it and set right on the well head was a jack-o'-lantern carved, lit, eyes flickering in the dark, kinda spooky, but no more than you'd expect to see on Halloween. And we could smell right away what the town's folk were complaining about, awful smell. Well anyway, before I knew it, Mitchell's got a hold of the rope and he's climbing down into the well, he's gone about 20 feet down, so I tossed my helmet down to him, it had one of those electric lamps on the front of it. Suddenly, the rope yanks and the light from the lamp goes out and Mitchell starts shouting, "pull me up, pull me up!" "I see him, I see him, it's the Boogeyman!" "pull me up!" And the crank handle was going around so fast and it flew up and hit the scarecrow, and then it hit the jack-o'-lantern, and everything went down into the bottom of that well. Well, I peered down into the well, but I couldn't see a thing, complete blackness, utter silence. And then the lamp on my helmet switched on and I see Mitchell's face looking back up at me. For a moment, that's all I can see. But then I see this clawed hand taking hold of Mitchell's hair and peeling it back off his head, like taking the peel off of orange. What did you do then? What did I do? I ran, I ran like hell. The company tried to shrug it off, they called it a workplace incident. But do you know, they never made any attempt to go down into that well and retrieve Mitchell's body? They filled it in, sealed it up, covered it over and they put up a building over the top of it. And do you know what building they put there? A barn. Oh Dad, enough with your ghost stories. He thinks just because Sam fell for them, everyone will. This is all I could find, I hope it'll work for you. This is amazing, you have no idea how much it means to me to actually be able to use their real haunt props for our fundraiser. Yeah. Ah, think nothing of it. When Michelle asked me it was a no-brainer. Thank you so much Mr. Daniels and thank you Walt for sharing your story with us. You're welcome, oh, and girls, remember to follow the rules. We will, Walt, we will. Now, get out there and raise some hell. Sam and Josh both said they saw them, you know. Saw what? After I left the Harvest Dance, I, but they said they saw them, the, the monsters. I'm sure they thought so, but we don't know what kind of costumes those crazy people were wearing, it was Halloween after all. I mean, did you see them? No, I just saw people in black robes. Since we're asking questions, do you really think they died? I don't know. I guess I like to think that Josh and Sam and the rest of your friends just decided they had had enough and took a leap and left this town and never came back. Knowing Josh, they probably groupies for Demon lnferno somewhere. I like to think so. I mean, who knows, maybe they will come to our Halloween Bash and crash the party. ♪ Don't touch ♪ ♪ Don't deem ♪ ♪ No shame, no guilt inside of me ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ I'm unstoppable ♪ ♪ I'm unstoppable ♪ ♪ We'll fight ♪ ♪ We'll fight ♪ ♪ We'll bleed ♪ ♪ The only way ♪ ♪ To stop deranging me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I know ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ I'm unstoppable ♪ ♪ I'm unstoppable ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Give it to me, baby ♪ ♪ Give me all that you got ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ So come on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Waiting for you, baby ♪ ♪ Take me over the top ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Give it to me, baby ♪ ♪ Give me all that you got ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ So, come on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ And show me what you got ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Give it to me, baby ♪ ♪ Give me all that you got ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ So, come on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Waiting for you, baby ♪ ♪ Take me over the top ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Give it to be, baby ♪ ♪ Give me all that you got ♪ ♪ Get it on ♪ Okay, before the Deltas show up for the mixer, I just wanna take this opportunity to thank all of you for helping to make our upcoming fundraiser possible, especially Michelle. Michelle has put more work into this event, more so than even I had planned to, originally. She spent countless hours there, at that place, by herself, bringing her designs to life and I don't think there's anyone who knows how much Sam and Josh would appreciate it more than her. Michelle, would you like to say anything? Yeah. So, with the fundraiser opening next week, we'll finally get to honor Sam and Josh, something I couldn't have done without all of your help. Ha, let's party like it's our last horah. All right. Gamma Tau psi! ♪ Oh, it's a Friday night creep out ♪ ♪ Friday night creep out ♪ ♪ Friday night creep out ♪ ♪ Friday night creep out ♪ ♪ And all around ♪ ♪ Do so and free ♪ ♪ Can't you see the victim here in me ♪ Thank you all for coming out, the haunt is just about to start. Make sure when you exit, you come back around to continue the party, the costume contest starts at 00pm, don't get too scared in there. And now some words from our sister, Heather. ♪ It's all right ♪ Tonight, we reclaim Halloween. Woo! We honor our lost and loved ones and most importantly, we re-open the barn doors. Welcome to Sam and Josh's Haunted Barn, 1002. Woo! Oh rules,. Rule number one, the only way to exit is to finish so there is no turning back. Rule number two, no running. And rule number three, don't touch the monsters and they won't touch you. And in true urban legend fashion, before you can enter, you must knock three times on the barn doors and say, "Trick or treat, Sam and Josh." Uh, anyone with tickets, meet me at the barn doors. Sounds about right. I mean, we're pretty zombie-like, right? I don't even know how to answer that, so I'm just gonna go ahead and crack open another brewski. Here you go, Chet. Right. I mean, half my body is stuck under the ground, so the most that I can do is like reach my arms out and like try to grab somebody or like open my eyes real wide or open my mouth real while like a zombie. - Whoo-whoo. - Wow, okay, uh, how many beers you got back there? Dudes, I think you're in the wrong spot. The fuck? No, no. Smell my feet, give me something good to eat! I guess this must be the place. Yeah, looks like it. Come on, we got work to do. No one there. Boo. - Order, order. - Boo! Folks, folks, quiet down now, now we've called this meeting because Miss Barnfart over here, is, is upset because we've reinstated Halloween. She wants to get... The faster we can make this vote to reinstate the ban on Halloween, the faster we can shut down that barn party. We do not want a repeat of where Weary Falls. So, remember to only pass out candy to the people in scary costumes. Don't ask, it's some weird rule Michelle and Heather stipulated and I'll be back for fill-ups in a bit, okay, just... Who dare enter my pumpkin patch? Dude, what the hell man? Keep moving. Dude, there can only be one Jack and I am the real jack, so piss off. The Helen's Valley Drive-in snack bar is now open, please visit us for all our tasty treats and our hot, buttered popcorn. And don't forget, our horror movie marathon continues right after this short intermission. Oh wow, Sheriff, I didn't expect you to be coming by for the marathon tonight. Well, Joe, as much as I'd love to check out your fine array of films this evening, I actually wanted to see if I could park the cruiser here and I wanted to check up on the kids at the haunt over the hill, make sure things are kosher. Okay, Cooper, put it by the snack bar, if you don't mind. And then once you finish your little stakeout, come on back and enjoy the show. Showing some good ones tonight? Oh, we're always showing good ones, but what are we showing? Oh, oh man, "House of Dismembered Waitresses," you gotta see this one. Double aardvark and four smashed heads, actually, triple aardvark and then quadruple aardvark, and 15 breasts, two scenes that don't make a lick of sense, gratuitous disco dancing, and it's that one with beach girls roasted on barbecue spits. Not to worry... I gotta tell you, Joe, you have a strange way of selling your films that I do not understand, but I will admit does make me wanna... Check it out, right? - See you in a while. - All right folks, the blood bath continues with our second piece. - Two. - There you go, enjoy the haunt. - Thank you! - Oh. Well, if it isn't a legendary lap dance Larry, himself. I hear we have you today for this event. Hey, my apologies if I caused you guys any trouble last year, but you're welcome. Hey, are Tracy or Jessica participating in the activities tonight? Yes, Larry, I hope you plan on making a large donation this year. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'ma, I'm gonna be your number one supporter. ♪ Take a piece of your pie ♪ Enjoy. ♪ Bam, bam ♪ ♪ About to take it all night ♪ ♪ It goes bam, bam ♪ Two? Oh, hey, nice of you to join us. Why don't you come take a seat on the bed with us? Whoa, hold there, Chief. We could use a big strong man to help protect us from that deranged mechanic on the loose. We heard he is out looking for lonely school girls. Hell yeah! I'm a big scary monster. Hey, you wanna mess with the nerd? Sure. Wow, Brett, you got them so good. Yeah? You girls like my scaring techniques? Wow, you Gamma girls are looking so fine tonight, man. So hot, it's like staring into the sun or something, you know? Oh yeah? You like what you see? Heck yeah, I do. It's like I can't look 'cause I'm blinded by the hotness, you know? Brett, there's another group coming, get in the closing. Oh man, this is bullshit. Ugh, we'll talk later. Lucas, what are you doing, bud? You know you shouldn't leave your station. Go over there, bud. You'll get more scares while everyone's looking at me. Go on, idiot. Sheriff Coop, come on down. I can assure you there is no underage drinking going on. I was hoping you wouldn't spot me so quick. On the bend to check on us, huh? Well, you know Barnhart, just making sure things aren't getting outta hand. Well, since you're here, you might as well partake in the fun, no charge. ♪ Will you ♪ Might take you up on that, it's been ages since I've been in a haunted house. And we can have a beer with your name on it when you come back around. Mm, I'm on duty. Sheriff is headed over to enter the haunt, let's push him to the front of the line and get him through, wanna keep the party going and not scare everybody off. Corey, I forgot my candy in the dorm room. Can I snag some of yours before Lisa finds out? What don't you want me to find out? I was just looking for some more candy, I ran out already. Already? Hmm, well, I guess I can go grab some more from my personal inventory, follow me. Oh my God. Oh my God, is that Corey? Is he okay? Oh my God! We have a pause in the line, gonna be about a five minute break. Get in the zone. These girls are totally in to me, man. Think I'm actually gonna get laid. This is gonna be the best day of my life. Whoa. Hey Britt, let's try again, but this time let's amp it up a bit. Okay. - Hey Brett. - , It would be nice if you came out here. What are you yanking it in there? Why are you dressed like that now? This costume doesn't even go with the set. In case you didn't hear, we had a five minute break to do whatever we want. Is that a corn cup in your pants or are you just happy to see us? So, what happens when you get real excited? Do you pop corn down there? Come on, Brett, don't you wanna join in on the fun? This could be your last chance, big boy. All right, creeper, that's enough, we were just having a little fun. Might actually have gone somewhere, but you just made this really weird. Britt, I'm pretty sure he cream corned in his pants already. Okay, for real, dude. Cut the act and lose the mask, you're actually creeping me out now. Thank you. Can I say I'm really impressed with this costume? Thank you, my inspiration comes from future me. You know, first, Charlie, lowly, video store clerk, but eventually, old, senile pizza delivery man. Who, who are you? Well, I think Heather has me beat costume-wise. What about my costume? It's supposed to be a bitchin' in 1040s baseball babe with attitude and nothing says attitude more than this here bat. Besides, if any of the frat dudes get a little too touchy, touchy with the sister see, I'll break their kneecaps with the peacemaker here. Ew, this is so fun, this reminds me of working at the roller ring. Have you been there? Oh yeah, I remember seeing you there all the time back when I used to skate, when my legs worked. I'm, I'm, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it. I'm just messing around. But I do remember seeing you there, back when I would take my brother to skate. But yeah, this seems like it's going pretty great so far. Yeah, I mean, Heather and I are so excited for, you know, Sam and Josh and... Yeah, Sam, he, he really would've liked all this. He was your boyfriend, right? When all that happened? No, we were friends. I mean, maybe, who knows? Like in another life or, or something, um. Anyway, is it true you didn't know who I was when you saw me at the video store? I told you, I, I didn't know at first. I mean, I probably wouldn't have sent you to check out a barn, if I did, just saying. Fair. Uh-oh, looks like a line's forming. I better get back to it before my boss starts cracking the whip. Yeah, you should. I know, she scares me. Oh, well, well. Oh, here. ♪ Fire, let's go roll ♪ Dude, we are killing it. Has the feed back been good? Uh, I'm not sure, no one's come back around yet. I think people are just headed over the hill to the drive-in marathon, but as far as ticket sales go, we are raking in the dough. Oh, hi. Thank you. Enjoy. Gross, ugh. Can someone come down here and clean up the vomit off the floor, in front of the dungeon? Not it, this shit's everywhere. Uh, copy that, I'll send someone in shortly. Did you hear that? We just made someone puke. Ah, you scared me, go ahead. Hey, I thought they told you the rules outside You don't touch us and we don't touch... Welcome to the slaughter house, I want your flesh I'm the Boogeyman. Tori, babe, even for a couple of bucks, this is pretty damn lame. Wait a second, is that you Lucas? No, it's not Lucas. Yeah, Tori, that is definitely Lucas. - Yeah. - No, I, I'm the Boogeyman. That mask sucks and, uh, did your mom make the costume too, loser? You know my mom's in County. I'm here doing charity work for the sorority girls around the corner, I'm sleeping in the back for a week, eating banana peels and sucking on apple cores. Okay, okay, okay, now, this dude looks badass. Do me a favor, bud, and put that Boogeyman out of his misery. I'm the one in the costume busting my ass, what do you want? Charity work my ass, kill him. Yeah, crank it. Damn! Hey man, how the fuck do you do that? No, no, no. Run you a little worm, maybe next time you'll remember the safe word and I'ma let you out.

I haven't even gotten to the best part. Tracy! My name is Stanley Daniels, but I'm sure many of you know me more as the father of one of the missing children, Sam Daniels. The truth is, the real reason he left that night was because Ms. Barnhart called me and asked me to have Sam collect canned goods on Halloween night as his punishment for a prank he played on her. Okay, settle down, settle down, it's true. I did ask Sam to do that, in hopes of showing him the consequences of his action. Why is this the first time we're hearing about the truth? Hey, does any one know where the full gas cans are? The generator's almost empty. Heather, where'd you put the gas cans? Oh shit, shit, shit, I completely forgot with everything going on. It's gonna be ruined without electricity. It's okay, I'll go get them. Where did you put them? I left 'em in my car, but I'll grab them. I got it. No, it's okay, I'll get them. No, I got it, it's our haunt and I dropped the ball. There's a gas station 10 miles up the road, just gimme 20 minutes, I'll be right back. Is everything all right? Yeah, it's fine. It was just a little hiccup. Eh. Boo! Oh my God, I, I, I'm so sorry, it's just you said hiccup and then I did a hiccup thing and then here we are, oh... Um, it's okay, it's all right. Um, it gives me a, a reason to change anyway. - Yeah. - Anyway, can you watch the table? Yeah, no problem. Where is everybody? Oh, steam locomotion, real scary, girls. All right, roger that, I'll be ready. Is that a pig? Come here, piggy. Come on, come on little buddy. Oh shit! Look, we should let the kids have Halloween. This is ridiculous and you know it, Sarah. Dr. Rock, I would like to hear what you have to say. Oh, Dr. Rock, what would you like to say? Or play, I suppose. Well, first and foremost, I want to extend my condolences to all the families who suffered from this terrible tragedy. The only people who should be blamed for what happened at Weary Falls are the cult members themselves, who committed these heinous acts. Placing the blame anywhere else or on any anyone else, is unacceptable. I feel awful that these kids who went to a concert that I promoted have gone missing. And yes, you're right, this is, this is my keytar. Dr. Rock's touring days are long gone, but I still like to play music every now and then, it brings me enjoyment. Miss Barnhart, Halloween is their instrument, let them have their fun! Yeah! Thank you. Hey guys, it's Dotty. I found Jen's walkie, but no, Jen. Also, I shit you not, but there is a trick or treater climbing out of the well. Someone needs to go fix that before we get fucking sued. Yeah, this is Michelle, I'll check it out. Can you cover again? Sure thing. Ah, 'ey, you might wanna put something on since you're not in costume anymore. Oh, smart thinking, Lincoln.

Oh, it's you. Where the hell have you been all night? Some of us have actual jobs, Dr. Dingleberry. Look, it was supposed to say Dinglegary. I don't know which one of you took it upon yourselves to make it say this. Now, where the hell is Tiff? I don't know, she left like an hour ago to get candy. That is so annoying, I can't find Jen either. Yeah, well that sounds like a you problem. Here's your candy. You are a huge dick. - Yeah, it is. - Ew. Sounds like we got some trick or treaters, get in your spot, Dr. Dinglegary. Come in, the doctor will see you now. Oh my God, is no one in their stations tonight? At least I can practice on you guys before the real trick or treaters get here. Meet our mad doctor, pay no attention to his one eye, he's a little self-conscious. Mwha-ha-ha. Hello? Jen? Are you down here? Hey, psst. Ow, what the hell? God, first you kiss me, then you punch me? Ow. Oh, how are you alive? I, I missed you so much. How, how, how did you get here? Listen, we don't have time for that right now. There are things walking around out there and it is not safe, we need to hide. But this is haunted house in Helen's Valley, these are people from college, l... That's not possible, what do you mean? Well, I sent you in a van hours ago to go find help. Sam, that was three years ago. Where's Josh? What the hell is that? Who the hell did this? I've never seen it before, it, it could have been anyone. Did you have a car? The sheriff you killed had one. He, he parked over at the drive-in. All right, we might need this. Ah, here we go, a pick-up. Hello, Charlie, Charlie, if you can hear me, it's really dangerous down here. Can you please make sure everybody exits through the front? I repeat, exit through the front. Okay, we have to go, be quiet. - Hello, hello? - Run! Hello, Michelle? You were breaking up, I, I had to step aside to hear you. What's going on? Hello? I don't see a cop car anywhere. Just keep looking, make your way to the concession stand, come on.

We have to get back into town and warn everybody what's going on. Dispatch, dispatch, come in, over. I know we can find some important people. Barnhart is having a town hall meeting at the chapel and of course she's putting the nail in the coffin of all things Halloween and she's using you and the other missing kids as her reasoning. Of course, she is, she told me she would. Sam, where were you? I don't think you'd believe me if I told you. I just saw my sorority sisters eating each other's brains out. Of course, I'll believe you. We managed to stop the feeding and in doing so, we, we broke the golden rule. We tricked the treat. We got locked in the basement, the building somehow went up in flames, there was no way out except for this hole in the floor, it looked like some kind of well or something, I don't know, it just... All I can remember is waking up. I, I, I couldn't find Josh. I looked all over the place, I never saw him again, I couldn't even find a way out. But I saw them, they were there. Fixed back up, pieced together. That's why they're back, they're back 'cause they wanna finish what we started. They, they're here for you, they're here for me, they're here for redemption. Sam, what's going on with your hand? It was the miner. What the fuck? What, what's wrong? I don't know l... Shut the fuck up. Are you okay? I don't know, I, uh, Right here, over here, pull over here, pull over here. Hello, Michelle? Hello? Anybody? Hello, is any- - Stairs! Okay, okay, we've talked about a lot tonight, the important thing is we get out and shut down that barn party. Enough! There's some real scary shit out there and you have been using what happened to me and my friends to fuel your Halloween crusade for years. But you don't know what happened because you weren't there. And you know what? You will when those things start breaking down the door. What in tarnation is going on here? Sam? You're alive! Oh my, you're alive. How is this possible? I'll explain everything later, Dad. But you and everybody else, you guys need to stay inside, lock the doors, the windows, grab anything that you can that can be used as a weapon. Calm down, everybody, keep your mud flaps closed. Come on, come on. What the hell was that? Oh my God, what was that? It's just a Halloween pumpkin head, who's got some candy corn? Get away from that, don't touch it! What is that? Yeah, he does that. We're gonna need all the help we can get. What kind of tools do you have in that maintenance shed? Forgive us, Father, we're about to sin. Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh, my, my, my. ♪ Ah, what ♪ ♪ I did that, uh, uh ♪ Tony! That's rock and roll, baby. Just go inside, keep everybody safe. Sam, there's too many, we have to go. Shit, we've gotta hide. Get in the hardware store. We can't, it's locked. Watch out, I've got this. Do you think they saw us? Oh, God, I hope not, here. That might hold 'em. The last thing we want is to take 'em on all at once, trust me. - They're coming. - What? You're locally found hardware in a wide selection. Okay, soon as they walk away, we make a run for the door. Okay. Shit. Okay, new plan, we go out this door. Okay. Fuck! We always have the best prices on favorite brands of power tools. Ask one of our press members to help you, to show you our amazing selection. Need some fixer-up advice? We're here to fix you up right. Dave's Tool Shed is the place for all you're home improvement needs. Does this look familiar, huh? Sam! Attention, Dave's Tool Shed shoppers, the store will be closing in 15 minutes. Please, bring your final purchases to the cash register. We will open tomorrow at 0:00 am. Thank you for shopping with us and have a nice day. We have to get those things back into the well at the barn because now that they're dead, all the others should be heading back and we can send them all back to hell together. Oh my God, heather's at the barn. Heather who? Josh's sister, Heather, she went to go get gas for the, for the generators. And I, I, totally forgot. Michelle, we need to go right now. No, Sam, Sam, Sam. Michelle, Michelle, promise me you're gonna finish this. No, you're gonna go with me, you're gonna help me, Sam. You're gonna, you're gonna help me, you have to help me. Sam. - Michelle. - Yeah? - Oh, Sam. - Michelle. L, I love you. I love you, too. Hello? Shh, they'll hear you. Charlie, what is going on? Get in here. No, seriously, where is everyone? I don't know, I came inside to find Michelle and I ended up getting chased through the haunt by your sorority sisters. And I don't know what's wrong with them, but they attacked me and I bashed him in the head with my brace and, and there is something big in here, really big, flying around, following me through the barn. Charlie, there are birds and bats and owls all over this place. Wait, what did you do to the sorority sisters? No, no, no, it is some kind of creature. I think everybody's dead or, or undead, or fucking something crazy, I don't know. Don't move. Hey! Heather, are you okay? Charlie, are you okay or what...? Wait, what are those, monsters? Those things? Huh, nothing much, just your average pig man and weird-ass crow creature. Where have you been? - Sam's back. - What? Yeah, and everything, everything his grandfather said that, the, the legend, it's all true. And it's Sam and I, we, we killed them and now we have to take that bag and put it in the well and finish this. Did you say Sam's back? Yeah, he came from the well with the monsters. It worked, it actually worked, I can't believe it. You can't believe what worked? The knocking on the doors, the saying "Trick or treats, Sam and Josh." I, I just thought of Michelle was right and they really did unleash something in Weary, there was a chance that maybe they were still with those things, somewhere and that maybe Sam and Josh would be released too. And I mean, the minute you found that barn I, I knew that if it was real, that if they came back on Halloween, I wanted the chance to end it. Where's Josh? Where, where is Sam now? Michelle, I, I didn't think it was really gonna work. And even, even if it did, I didn't think about the repercussions. I didn't either, at all. Um, but I did build booby traps in here so we can get out. So, let's just take the stuff, put in the well and just stay close to me, and we'll get out of here. Run! What are we waiting for? Just the right moment. How do we kill this thing? I don't know, but it needs to go to the basement. Are you sure this net can hold the weight of a super beast? Shit. Go! No! What is it? What are we looking for? Uh, there should be a wire here. I can't find it. Hey, over here! Hey, big guy. It's me you want, come on. Okay, when I say ready, hit the switch. Three, two, one, now! Now! Now! Go, go, go, run, go. Michelle, there's nothing in here. Sorry, Charlie, Jump, Heather. Come on, let's get him to the well. Hey-o, long time, sis. I got something for you, you three-headed bastard. Who's got a light? I could burn his ass. Well, if it isn't the Christian cowboy himself. Look who decided to show up at the last minute. Hey. I knew you were alive. I'm back. What took you so long? Well, I had to wait 'til the end to save the day. Let's get the fuck outta here. Yeah. Steer clear there. It worked, your plan worked.
