When she first arrived she had wounds all over her body but it wasn't that serious Kay! Miss, I want to see the doctor When your sis arrived, she had lost the ability to speak We have no means of understanding what happened to her! Why are the wounds so big, what kind of disease is this? There was such disease after the bomb dropped in Hiroshima At first we thought it was caused by the atomic dust but the test result was negative We had held several conference in discussion but failed to determine what kind of disease it was! Can I bring her back to Hong Kong for treatment? This isn't good. I think she shouldn't be moved at this time. We shall try to cure her Alright! Goodbye! Goodbye, doctor! Wai Lun! Yeuk Chee, I've been waiting for a long time! I come immediately upon receiving your call! How's your sister? Her body's all wounded. The doctor doesn't know such disease. What can be done? Don't worry, I think the hospital will have means When we were studying in Canada You always asked me to be optimistic Have you forgotten that? Wai Lun, the thing has already happened Even if you worry like this, it won't change! You must be hungry, why don't we go for dinner Afterwards, we can take a stroll down the market Alright! Such a large Durian Do you like it? No, it doesn't taste nice! I am the king of centipedes when buying centipede ointment, remember this mark It cures everything, it's very effective Now, "Shan-Ha" is very venomous, right? A guy asked me what "Shan-Ha" is "Shan-Ha" is scorpion. It is very poisonous If one is bitten by it One will die immediately! But don't be alarmed with my centipede ointment I guarantee you will be safe It can cure every kind of poison, it always works Not even the fairy can cure you if you're stung by centipede Don't be afraid...! Shall we try to ask the king of centipedes? Quacks are unreliable Anyway, the doctor can't tell it. Perhaps he'll know. Wait here for a while! King of centipedes! What's the matter? Would you see a patient with an unknown disease? No problem. Bring me tomorrow! I shall go with you! Mr. Chan, what is my sister's disease? It is difficult to say Mr. Chan I cannot cure her illness Why? But I can ask my teacher, he will have a way! Please get your teacher quickly! It will be too late, he lives very far away!

Beware and do more charity Born to be wealthy Yeuk Chee, do you believe in this? Sure, in SE Asia we all believe in these things It is strange! I didn't believe in fortune telling or evil spirits before But now... Then you do believe you'll encounter a big disaster? If it is to come, I hope I shall escape That's easy. Do more charity! What are you doing? I seem to have seen something! There's nothing. Please go! Master, just now I met a young man who appeared to be related to the Paks This is his birthday statistics!

Is this revenge? What revenge? Your father had mentioned one thing before What, mummy? He said your grandpa when he was young in SE Asia had done a shameful thing there What shameful thing? He did not tell me There's a thing I don't understand Your grandpa never talked about his life in SE Asia But how did your father find out? Mummy! What's the matter? Nothing! Are you not feeling well? Nevermind, it's just a slight headache. Nothing serious Perhaps you were too tired. Go to bed early! Mummy, does anyone know Grandpa's behaviour in SE Asia? Your grand uncle may know because when he was young he had worked with your grandpa in SE Asia! I had a hard time with your grandpa when we were young We went to SE Asia to work in the mines Later we worked in rubber plantations Those days were really difficult He met a girl later and got married! Actually he married into the girl's family So he didn't have to work hard anymore But one year, a big fire broke out in his village and it was burnt down entirely I even thought he was burnt to death only had I come back to Hong Kong I found him still alive and had become a philanthropist Do you know how grandpa returned? I don't! Grandpa, I want to come down! Alright Come on, I'll carry you down! Cousin, please carry me down! Don't be afraid, here you are Thank you! Grand uncle! You play with them, I'm leaving Say goodbye to Cousin! Goodbye! Bye! Come when you are free! Bye! You seem to have something on your mind Something on my mind? Yes! Kay is dead! Kay died? When? A week ago in SE Asia When she died, many insects crawled out from her wounds Would a spell been cast on her? Or was it some evil spirit! What's the matter, uncle? Sorry! Yes, yes! OK! My father said the aggrieved spirits wouldn't go away! Mr. Cheung! Please have them reorganised! Yes, I'll do it very well Hurry up, he has to bring them back to H.K.!

Yes, I had gone to Europe for some business! Yeuk Chee has told me your sis's matter! It is so unexpected Thank you for your kindness. It has happened There's something strange even on the day of her death The doctor wasn't able to tell what disease it was What's your opinion? The doctor's analysis was correct! Only atomic radiation will lead to rapid decay of the skin Even if she was bitten by some snakes, centipedes or scorpions the most would be instant death! I think... What? Perhaps it was something evil! Something evil? Perhaps it was a spell! A doctor won't admit such things! But I believe this is possible Even now there're many things without scientific explanation Come to my house with Yeuk Chee tomorrow! Come, this way! How does this house look, Wai Lun? Very good, very spacious! This is the living room, the kitchen, bedrooms are upstairs. I'll go up with you! Good! Wai Lun, which room do you like? This one! Good! What are you thinking? You even refused to go swimming! Chee, have you heard of a village fire here many years ago? Why do you ask this? I only asked casually. Do you know? Yes, my father had said many people had died! Do you know where the place is? No, but my father may know Why don't we ask him? Ah Weng, good boy! Chee, you are free today? Yes, my friend wants to ask Father something Let me introduce, Mr. Pak Wai Lun My former schoolmate in Canada! He is a mighty priest! Priest! Mr. Pak, I am leaving first! See you later!

This I'm not sure! Can I still find that village? It is not far from here but even when you are there you won't know it was that burnt down village! Perhaps it is just around! This is the place where Kay had the accident! How do you know? The tourist guide had brought me here once! Yeuk Chee! Sir! Excuse me! You've come to look for me? We've come to take a look Please look around Sir! Do you know an accident happened here not long ago? Everyone knows such a big news! What happened to them? It seems they were bitten by insects There are all sorts of poisonous insects in such place! They were hard luck enough to be bitten! Sir, have you heard that many years ago a village here was burnt down in one night? What actually happened? I don't know! I've heard that the village was burnt The village must have had very bad luck! Someone set fire to it they all died painfully That person was worse than an animal Kind hearted will be paid well in return while the wicked will be revenged upon, he cannot escape! Sir, that night, sir... Let's go! He was terrible just now! Maybe it was my mentioning the fire that hurt him! Hey, Ping Keung has come! Have you been here long? Just arrived. Is everything satisfactory? Your house is so large, of course it's comfortable! How are you feeling? Nothing, I've a slight headache! I always have it recently, perhaps I'm tired! Yes, Ping Keung, yesterday you said over the phone something strange about Kay's death? I was about to tell Wai Lun I know a priest who rears ghosts Rears ghost? He steals the corpses of children grills chines with fire until the oil drips out, then collects the oil puts it before the altar, immerses two little dolls inside Afterwards he puts them inside a little coffin says prayer for them 3 times a day 49 days later he says a special prayer to open the eyes of the dolls! The little dolls will be able to push open the coffin and sit up slowly! Now, those two dolls become his adopted ghosts and will obey all of his orders They will do whatever the priest says and they even dine with him You've had sufficient? Yes! Look, you're wasting the food, finish them all Right, that's a good boy! Go set up the altar now! Yes! When did your daughter fall ill?
