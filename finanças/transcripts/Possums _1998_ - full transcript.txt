Boy: Boy, he was hit flatter than a paper cup. The possums' quarterback shines blue as he jumps up and heads back to the line. Can they do it? Can the possums turn these last moments into something? The quarterback fades back to pass. But wait, it's the statue of Liberty play, with running back Charlie lawton taking the ball. Lawton dodges one tackle and another and... Oh, no! He tripped over his own feet! And yes, it looks like another fumble for the old trolley 5-thumbs lawton. This could mean the end of an undefeated season for the possums. But wait, out of nowhere, number 33 will Clark dives in, scooping up the ball. He saves the fumble! Woman: Wilbur! Wilbur: The crowd's on its feet. And he's running. The 40, the 30, the 20, the 15, the 5-- woman: Your father needs some help! Ok! And he's tackled at the 2. The crowd's going wild. With only 20 seconds remaining, the possums call a time-out. And while they do that, let's hear a word from our sponsors. Man: Wilbur? Wilbur? All right! Jeez! Announcer: We're back, as the possums break from the huddle. It'll be second down and 14. Johnson wide right. Rowlett takes the snap and drops back to pass. But no, it's the old statue of Liberty play! Fumble! We got a loose ball! Tackle Brian pritchard scrambles over the field and comes up with it at last. The possums keep the ball. After that very risky play it's third down and 2 yards to go. Time! Call time-out! Time-out! Time-out! Announcer: Taking their last time-out, the possums have exactly 7 seconds left to make something happen. What a powerful game this has been tonight, folks, down to the wire all the way. This last play could make or break the entire season for the nowata possums. All: Break! All: Break! Announcer: This is it, folks. Fourth quarter, final play, 7 seconds to go, the possums on their own 45 yard line. They're set in their usual wishbone offense. Rowlett tucked tight under center. Burns in motion. 3, 49! Hut, hut, hut! Announcer: There's the snap by Fisher. Rowlett steps back and searches for his Mark. And it's a blitz by prattville as big Brian bells breaks through the line. Rowlett lets it fly just as he's slammed into the ground! Boy, that ball has got air under it. Oh, my lord! I--i can't believe it! Kevin burns is all by himself in the end zone. Finally after 13 years... It's...an interception? Prattville's Joe sasser picks off the ball. And he's running-- the 25, the 40, across the 50, the 30, the 20... He's gone. Touchdown. Touchdown, prattville. A close game for the possums, but one that just wasn't meant to be, folks. Final score, prattville 72, nowata zero. And that'll do it for another heart-pounding season of possum football. Be sure and tune in again next year, folks. This has been your buddy, will Clark, the voice of k-rig sports. Thank you. Good night. Oh, I'm late. The alarm didn't go off again. I'll fix it. You've already fixed it once. Buy a new one. I'm not gonna throw away a perfectly good alarm clock. Well, it doesn't look right for the vice principal to be late for school. Oh, I'll take care of it, honey. Don't worry. Oh... Also, John called last night. Looks like his kid's made it into the 6-a finals. He wants to know if we'd come and see his game next week. Will? Oh, i--i don't know. This is your son, will. I got him. I got him this time. Will: Ha! I got you this time, Charlie! Hold it! You come back here and clean that mess up, you and your stinkin' dog. I don't know what you're talking about. It's these land mines all over the place. That's what I'm talking about. Not my Max. Not my dog. I've had it with you, Charlie! One of these days I'm gonna stick a cork up that dog's butt. Man: Who was that? The smallwoods, I believe. The smallwoods? I didn't know they were leaving. Yeah, he got job down in Dallas. Good morning, gentlemen. Oh, no, no, no. I'm the hummingbird. London's the flowers. Thank you, will. Mm-hmm. Thank you. A glorious day, ain't it? What is up with you? Almost a touchdown. So close you could smell it like an outhouse in August. And that's just about what it looked like. 13 years of unanswered prayers, my friends, almost came to an end last night. But it didn't. But they almost did. And guess what. 5 seniors is all we're gonna lose. So next year-- we'll have 14 years without a touchdown? O ye of little faith. Unless, of course, they get enough signatures. Hmm? What did you say? Nothing. No. Something about signatures. Don't listen to him. It's--it's-- it's all that radiation from the war. He doesn't know what he's talking about. What signatures, London? I'm warning you. My wife told me some people were passing around a petition to close down the high school football program. What people? I don't know. Who started it? I don't know. The mayor. I knew it! I knew it! He's been after the team for years, that back-stabbing, two-faced... Now I'm gonna put an end to that right now! You watch the store for me, Bob. Sure. Oh, I didn't mean-- hush up! You've lost your speaking privileges. Charlie? Charlie! What in the hell do you think you're doing? Now listen, I told you my dog did not take a dump on your-- who gave you the authority to cancel the football program? Oh, that. Listen, I'll see you gentlemen in my office. Bernice will set you up with some coffee. Ok. Thank you. All right. Good deal. Ahem. Now, will-- where is it written that you can just arbitrarily-- wait. Hold on now, will. Let's talk about this like 2 reasonable adults. Then it's true. Well, I'm afraid it is, but it's not official just yet. All I have is a petition. Who signed it? Now listen, will. For the past several years the football program's gone from dismal to... Downright disheartening. Did you see the game last night? Yes, I did. And even if they had scored, it still would have been 102 to 7. 72 to 7. Now next year-- y-you know, you've been saying that for years, and frankly, will, people are just tired of losing. They've been coming to me complaining. Who? Who? It doesn't matter who. But enough people were upset that I felt it my duty to initiate a petition-- I knew it. I am not making them sign it. Oh, yeah, well, I'm sure you're not trying to convince 'em otherwise, either. Listen, the money'll be better used elsewhere, will. Now I've got to get inside. Look, I'll, uh, talk to you when the petition's done and it comes to a vote, all right? If you get enough signatures. I'm gonna fight you on this, Charlie. Well, you better hope you do better than the possums. Will: Just walk away, folks. Walk away, please. Help nowata save the possums. Sir. Drop that pen, sir. This is a war, and that's their weapon. Thank you very much. Keep our possums in nowata. Hey, Paul. You got another year as quarterback, partner. Don't give that up. Tell your folks. Don't sign it, ok? That-a-boy. Save our possums, kids. Can I have one of those? Sure. Whoa, whoa! What are you doing? Doing what I should have done ages ago. I hate football. I never wanted to coach the dang sport. I can't help it. I teach history. It doesn't mean I coach football, too. It makes me vomit. Judas, brutus, and Benedict Arnold. Of all people, I thought you fellas were with me. Well, we are. It's just that-- you, too, Bob? Just look at him. Poor man. You talk to him yet? No. I can't even look him in the eye. I feel like I shot his best dog. London: Me, too. I even sent my wife in to get the feed yesterday. I miss the bench. Yeah. Yeah. Elizabeth: I thought we promised never to discuss that sport in this house. I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but I have to talk to somebody. Nobody else seems to care. The petition's complete, the town's voting the team away tomorrow night, and my wife won't even let me talk about football in my own house-- there, I've said it. What are you going to do? Hell, I don't know. Will: I know the possums aren't the greatest team in the world. You got that right. Will: We've never been to the state championships, we haven't had a winning season in 25 years. Heck, we haven't scored a touchdown in-- all: 13 years. 13 years. Right. But you don't shoot your dog just because he stops hunting. I do. Folks, listen. This whole thing isn't about me. A-a-and it's not about you. And it--it's not about some crummy football team. It's--it's about... It's about cool nights and--and Autumn leaves and--and--and smoke coming out of chimneys and... It's about those kids going out there every Friday night and playing their guts out. Hell, I don't know. It just seems to me that... If we cancel this football program... We're sending out a message that we've given up. And I don't think that's a message that we ought to be sending. Folks, please. Vote this petition down. Let's keep the possums. Thank you. Well, thank you, will. That was very moving. But I think we've already made up our minds. Excuse me. Could I say something? Sure. Come on up. On behalf of the nowata possums and all the students of nowata high, I'd just like to say... That we're tired of being invited to other people's homecomings because they know they can beat us. It's demoralizing. Please cancel the team. Thank you. Well, I reckon we've heard just about all that needs to be said on the subject. I guess it's time to take a vote. Any objections? Good. All in favor of the petition please raise your hands. Um, all opposed? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 7. 7. Well, by an almost unanimous vote, the petition passes. The program is canceled. And now to the next order of business, that pothole on old coyote road. Mr. Clark? Mr. Clark? Yeah. Uh... What? Uh, I'm sorry I'm not old enough yet to vote. I would have, you know. I appreciate it, son, but it wouldn't have done much good, anyway. Elizabeth: Will, get up. I never heard the alarm go off. It's been broken for over a year. Come on, get up. Tell me again about that big sophomore. The one you said would make a great center. You said that, not me. Now get up. You're gonna be late. What is this, week 4? They'd be battling marysville or... Will? Ok, ok. See you tonight. Mmm. Ooh, nice legs. Oh, god! Mangy, flea-bitten, half-breed! Dadgum it! The muses in classical mythology were goddesses of literature. Chapter 6 through 9 are due on Monday. Don't be surprised by a quiz. Sarah, can I talk to you a minute? You know, you should seriously think about writing. You have a real gift. Sarah: Oh, I don't know. It's always been just a hobby. Well, think about it. Excuse me, you, uh, dropped your, uh, folder. Oh, thank you. Hey, I'll carry those for you. Thanks, Paul. Yeah, no problem. Oh, hey, are you going to the lake tonight? I don't know. Everybody always goes to the lake. What else is there to do? See you, Josh. Jake. My name's Jake. Jake? Huh? The office still hasn't received your records and it's been over a year. I know. My stepdad and mom's divorce has been kind of, uh-- don't worry. I'll talk to my mom about it. You make sure you do. I will. Thanks. Hey, guys... Look what I bought yesterday. I was over in the wooly gardens, saw it in a hunting store. Couldn't resist. It's nice, isn't it? It's all right. Well, I guess it's official then. London: I hear it's gonna be a big one. Bigger than the one in Johnson falls. Yeah, I hear that, too. Do--do you ever think before you speak? They're gonna tear down the football stadium to build that store. It's all right. I was just talking. I swear, you are dumber than dirt. Y-you ought to try that thinking thing some time. Sorry, son, we're closed. Oh, actually, Mr. Clark, sir, I came in to apply for a job. You're looking at the entire workforce right here. Well, I just thought that maybe if you needed some help, may-- I appreciate the offer, but we don't need any help right now. Thank you. Ok. I--I'll leave my resume just in case. Jake: Blue, 42! Blue, 42! Set, hut! He dodges left, he finds his man deep-- hey! What are you doing out here? Man, you scared me to death. Sorry about that. What are you doing out here? I'm just playing. By yourself in the dark? So? What are you doing out here? Just looking around. By yourself in the dark? You got a nice arm on you, son. You want some light? You know how to turn on the lights? You ever see any games? Watched every one last year. I just never stood on the field. You got asthma or something? Something. Here. Have one. Oh, I'm only 17. It's only root beer, son. Oh. I.b.c. Drink only the best. Thanks. Damn. Had an arm on me when I was your age. Not fair, is it? Nope. No, it's not. I'm Jake Malloy. Hi, Jake. You're new around here, aren't you? Been here over a year. Oh, that's right. Your mom works over at Phil's. Hey, I'm sorry I was so short with you at the store. That's ok. You can call me will. It's actually wilbur, but only my wife can call me that. Hey. Would we have played marysville or sepulpa tonight? Marysville, I think. Would have been a heck of a game, too. Most of their team graduated last year. Nothing but inexperience. Possums only lost 5. Only 5 seniors. And the way they played the last game last year, mmm, really showed potential. Paul rowlett's arm? Yeah, and that, uh-- that big, uh, sophomore. The--the--the-- Ron foreman. Right. I hear he'd have made a hell of a center. A great center. Might have been a heck of a season. Yeah, it might have been. Ah, what am I thinking? Would have just got beaten worse. Maybe not. Believe me, it would have been a slaughter all the way. Maybe not. Hey, will? Yeah. Thanks for the root beer, I guess. Sure. Hey, will? Mm-hmm? Oh, I just wanted to say I enjoyed listening to your games. You made losing almost kind of exciting. Thanks. Jake... Get in. What? Get in. It's nice. We're back, fans. 2 minutes to go left in the third quarter. Uh, marysville has the lead 17 to 10. Marysville has the ball, but despite their home-field advantage, they're having a real tough go against this year's great possum defense. Sperry fades back to pass, and pow-- w-wait a second. What are you doing? I-- will: What a hit by possum linebacker-- what did he say? Paul... Will: I tell you, folks, these possums have really turned their defense around. Marysville's usually unstoppable-- you guys. Guys, you gotta hear this. Will: And they're stopped at their own 35. What an opportunity for the possums as they take possession of the ball. Quarterback Paul rowlett gets a play from the sidelines and rushes in. Prattville's safeties... Oh, god. Will: There's the snap, and it's handed off to dwyer, who breaks up the center. He dodges left, then right. And oh, my goodness, I can't believe it. He's across the 20, the 15, the 5. Oh, yes! Touchdown, possums! Holy smokes, what a play! Ha ha! And, uh, there's an injured player at the goal line. We're gonna take a quick time-out here and go to our sponsors. What the hell do you think you're doing? Earl, I just-- you just nothing. You can't break in here-- I didn't break in here. I have a key, Earl. But--but you can't be broadcasting a game-- oh, boy. K.r.i.g. No. No, sir. Nowata didn't get their team back. Well, i--i know they're playing better, but--but-- yes, sir. Well, thank you. Well? Well, he said, "keep up the good work," but that's not-- see, there are people who want to hear the games. The town needs a team to support. Oh, man. K.r.i.g. Yes, ma'am, I know the team is canceled. W-w-well, wait a minute. They're not really playing-- tell 'em it's like a radio play. It's--it's like a radio play. Well, we're back, fans. While we were gone, the extra point was made. The score's tied now, 17 to 17, as the possums kick off to marysville. Want a root beer? It's still cold. No, thanks. Well, 2 advertisers canceled. Possums: 27, marysville: 24. Great game. Possums record is 3 wins, 1 loss. We can't do this. I'll pay for the advertising. And I'll sponsor the whole thing. It's not right. It-- the town needs this. Oh, I don't know. Earl... Please. If I get any calls-- you won't. I promise. Thanks! Oh, Jake, I'll see you at 7:30 sharp. Don't be late. Store's busy on Saturday. Thanks. You know, I don't get it. Saturdays are usually our busiest day. Maybe it's a holiday. Wanna go get something to eat? I'm buying. Sure. Hey, everybody. How's it going? Howdy, boys. Missed you today. Yup. Had a lot of work to do today. Yeah, real busy. Yup. Real busy. Mind if we join you? Well, I don't know if there's room enough in here for you and your football team. What are you doing here? Will's buying me dinner. Well, that's nice of you. Thank you, by the way, for giving my son a job. Oh, he's a great worker. Well, you let me know if he gives you any trouble. Come on, mom. What can I get you? I think I'll have the special. I think I'll have a hamburger and a coke. You'll have the special and a milk. Mom! That sounds good. I'll have a glass of milk myself. You got it. Oh, great. Hey, will. Charlie. I, uh, heard the game last night. Did you? Mm-hmm. Best record the possums ever had. Mm-hmm. I hear we're playing again next week. Yup. Well, I tell you, I'm not too happy about that. I, uh, suppose you wouldn't call it off, would you? Nope. Thought not. Ok. Just be careful, will. I'll be watching. Here you go, boys. You know, if you're gonna do this right, you gotta get the players' names straight. You were butcherin' 'em all over the place last night. Bobby ennis. Carl's younger brother? Yup. Ooh! There he is, Phil's son. Oh? Ron foreman-- center. Center. And it's possums 12, hogart 7. There's the snap, and the-- oh, it's a blitz by the possum defense! Johnson scrambling. He's scrambling, and-- oh! He's brought down hard by Carl ennis and brother Bobby ennis. For a 7-yard loss. Great team this year. There's a pass. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-ooo-ooo! Yeah, yeah! Go! Go, possums! Go! Touchdown, possums! Yes! What a run! Kevin burns laid a powerful block on somebody in there, and opened up a hole big enough to drive a double-wide through. Pryor just waltzed into the end zone untouched. Man, this crowd is going wild tonight. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-ooo-ooo! Hey, hey! What are you doing?! Nobody's listening to the silly thing. Well, I was! The possums are doing good, now, turn that back on. Suit yourself. Will: Ouch! What a tackle. He went down like a 29-cent pair of socks! Come on, Max. Do your stuff, Max. Come on, Max. All right, folks. This could be 5 wins in a row for the possums, bringing their season record to 6 and 1. 12 seconds remaining. Score tied 13 apiece. And here we go. Rowlett back to pass. There's the snap. It's a blitz by the uleg mustangs. Rowlett scrambles right, and lets one fly. And it's caught by the possums. Yeah! Yeah! Touchdown, possums! Yes! Don't you think this thing's gettin' just a little out of hand? Maybe. At least we're winning. Winning? How can we be winning when we don't even... Have a team. Thank god you're finally here. I told you I had a meeting in prattville. The mayor of uleg called this morning regarding last Friday's game. What'd he say? Apparently he had already called the mayors of Salem Springs and Hobart because they called at least already twice this morning! All right, um, um, get Sam from uleg on the phone first. And i--i want to talk to Earl over at the radio station right now. Sam and Earl, yes, sir. Hi. Is there anything I can help you with? Yeah. Oh, hi, Justin. Jake. Jake. That's right. I'm sorry. I'm terrible with names. I didn't know you worked here. Oh, recently. Oh, I need something for my cat. Cat, ok. She's in heat. Thanks. Earl's here. I can see that. Oh. Yes. Guess so. Well, ok, I'll be out here if you need me. Thank you, bernice. You know what I've spent most of this day doing? I have no idea. Well, I'll tell you. I've been trying to pacify mayors all across this state. Mayors of towns that... Mayors of towns that you say we've beaten in football. And? And? And you gotta put a stop to this nonsense! Nowata doesn't have a football team, Earl. I know. Well, then, stop will from pretending we do! No. No? You heard me, Charlie. It's my radio station, and I'll broadcast whatever I choose. And as long as will is paying for his airtime, he can do anything he wants to do. But it's a lie. It's not a lie. It's like a fantasy of sorts. That's the same thing! Besides, I kinda like it. Well, we've got some good news from the sidelines. Rowlett's shoulder injury is not too serious, but it is questionable as to whether he's gonna be able to return to the game tonight. And with the possums down by 3, this could place their winning streak in serious jeopardy. For the first time this season, backup quarterback Jake Malloy steps in for the possums. I could've taken that hit. And they're lining up against the union bulldogs. Back the hand-off to lawton, and it's a fake. Malloy's found a hole, and he's at the 20... The 15...The 5...Touchdown! Oh, quarterback draw by backup quarterback Jake Malloy. You're doing good! Way to go, Jake. All right. I can run the 100 in 11 seconds. Yeah, sure you can. I did it last year. You never did any-- hi, Jake. Hi. How you doing? Congratulations on your touchdown. Thanks. There's the new quarterback right there: Jake Malloy. You finished cleaning up in the back? Yup. Where'd you find that? In the stock room. Did you play? Little bit. Second string. What I was good at was announcing. What about that clipping on the wall. Said you were scouted by all the big colleges. That wasn't me. That was my son. I didn't know you had a son. Yup. Lives up in bartlesville. How old is he? 27. He's an assistant coach at bartlesville high. You don't talk about him much. You got a good arm. You gotta work it. I kinda screwed up there. Halfway through John's senior year he messed up his knee a little bit. Doctor said it wasn't anything serious, but he ought to keep off of it. We had a big game coming up, and I convinced him he should play. Screwed up his knee for good. What position did he play? Quarterback. He was a damn good one, too. Here. Throw me one. Good toss. Let's see what you got. Come on. That's all right. Come on, we know you got a good arm, I wanna see how good you can scramble. I just...Uh... What? Come on. I just don't like getting hit. Why not? You're gonna play football, you're gonna get hit. I just don't, ok? How about I just teach you how not to get hit? Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you. See if you can get by me. Oh, not bad, but next time, you gotta-- Jake? Jake! Jake, I'm sorry! Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing here? What's this? Look, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry? I'm sorry, ok? No, you're not, or you wouldn't have done it in the first place. Well, what do you want me to do? I can't talk football with you. Oh, don't give me that, will. I've always supported you. When you gave up announcing and came back here to take over your father's business, I supported you! I came back because I had to. No, you didn't! You felt obliged, and I understood that. But you can't just make these decisions without talking to me. Look, it's only gonna be for a little while. You don't get it! This is me! This is our home! And you're gonna mortgage it all away on some team that doesn't even exist! Why does this mean so much to you?! Wait. You shouldn't be the one that has to leave. I'll go. Fine. Noble 23, nowata 7. With only a few minutes remaining, this looks like it could be the end of the possums' winning streak at last. That said, there's a time-out on the field, and, uh, time, I guess, for us to hear from our sponsor--me. Touchdown, Malloy! Hi. Hey. How'd you get the lights on? I just-- you know, someone showed me. What are you doing here? Well, I run...Sometimes. On Friday night? Well, you know, i-- do me a favor. What? Time me. What? Time me. To the 50-yard line and back. Ok. 50 yards and back. Go! What's it say? 16 seconds. Damn! Damn. All right, do it again, but this time, be sure and press the stop button as soon as I cross the finish line. All right. Go! I still say that Paul rowlett was suffering from last week's injury. He wasn't playing his own game. No, no, it was the offensive line. Rowlett played great, but the line kept letting the defense through. It's been their problem all season. Hey, my son's the center and he doesn't let anybody through. That's true. I've seen the boy. Heh. He wouldn't let anybody through. I think you've had enough. You're all full of it! Heh. Noble's got a run-and-shoot offense. The possums haven't seen anything like it all year long. Hey, it threw 'em. That blevins kid, he's got some tricks up his sleeve. Yeah, we'll get 'em this-- we'll get 'em this next week. You know we're gonna be ready for 'em. That's right. So, I'll see you Friday night then? Ok. Hey, you guys. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened to you? These football players. They beat you up? What? No, I tripped runnin' over here. Well, these football players-- no--no, wait. The most amazing girl ever asked me out on a date. But these football players, I thought I was dead, but then they said they loved the games. I gotta tell Mr. Clark. It's closed. What? Why? I don't know. He was acting kind of strange. 'Cause he's--he's been jumpin' down my throat for the least little things lately. See? It's not in my head. It's some kind of mid-life crisis. The highs and the lows-- I saw a lot of it in the service. The only thing you saw in the service is pots and pans. A good chef knows his men. Bob: Advertising. What? Maybe it's all that advertising. He has to pay for the football games, doesn't he? That's true. With that maxi mart comin' in, he could be worried about his business. Yeah, I heard over in Johnson falls when the maxi mart moved in, half the local businesses closed down. I'll bet that's it. I'll tell you one thing. I'm not gonna shop there. Neither am I... Unless, of course, I can't find it anywhere else and, well, you gotta. Right. Right. Well, only then would it be ok. Only then. Hey, that's Clark. Will on radio: Well, it's almost full capacity here at stillwater. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since the winner of this game heads for the playoffs. The score's all tied up, 13-all. And there's the kickoff-- a high-flying kick deep into possum territory. And Eric dryer fields it at the 10. No--no. Throw it-- throw it to Eric! Throw it to Eric! Will: He's at the 25, the 30, the 35, the 40, and bam! He's knocked out of bounds by stillwater's Eddie Taylor. Hey, Mr. Clark. Jeez, you scared me, Calvin. Sorry. Here we go. Hey, how can you be here and announcing the game at the same time? Well, I recorded it earlier, Calvin. Oh. You want some hot chocolate? Sure. I must have drank it all. I--i can go get some more. No, that's ok. Thanks. It's a... It's a good game tonight. Hut! Hut! Will on radio: Barry gilmore scoops it up and runs it in for a touchdown! Yeah. Touchdown, possums! Whoa, they've made the playoffs! Touchdown, possums! For the first time in the history of nowata-- TV announcer: And thanks to what almost feels like summer... Hey. What are you doin' here? I thought you'd be off announcing the game. No, I recorded it earlier. Uh... Are you ok? The news, it's shocking. Honey, uh... Uh, I can't go on like this. I love you. I'm not gonna let anything come between us. I've decided to stop doin' the games. What? The--the possums are in the playoffs. You can't just stop. Elizabeth, you were the one that-- you can't just start somethin' and not finish it. But I thought you didn't-- me? No. I prefer not. But the town-- you have to. Really? Don't make me repeat myself. Hey, wait a minute. How did you know about the possums bein' in the playoffs? Elizabeth: What did you say? TV announcer: And finally, as the high school football playoffs begin, there's an unexpected entry in the state's 2-a division. The nowata possums clinched a spot in the playoffs with a 23-20 win over the stillwater vikings. Ha ha. That's right. Haven't had a team all year, but the local sports announcer has created a winning season for the imaginary team. Oh, god. So, uh, you wanna sit down? Sure. So do you always take your dates out to feed stores? Well, you know, watched the big freezin' in the lake, so I thought this would round off the tour of nowata quite nicely. I never thought about that. You're so right. What are you gonna do after graduation? I don't know. How 'bout you? I've been thinkin' a lot about it. I've grown up here most of my life, and all I know is I wanna do something exciting... Maybe politics or a writer. I've always written. Really? Me, too. Well, sometimes. What do you write? I don't know. You know, stories mostly-- bits and pieces of stuff. Is that what you wanna do? I don't know. For a long time, I thought when I graduated I'd just jump on a bus and disappear. So what do you think now? Right now, I'm just enjoyin' sittin' here with you. Me, too. That's good wood, Bob. Where'd you find it? Around. Here you go. Thanks, Jake. Beautiful mornin'. Thanks, son. Heck of a game last night. What the hell are you up to now, will? What are you talkin' about? Don't play stupid with me. Not only have you turned this town into a statewide joke, but now you're destroying private property as well. Don't point at me, Charlie. What private property? The maxi mart billboard, will. You cut it down. Will: Why, that's a bigger load of manure than that slop-fed pig dog of yours dumps in my yard every mornin', and you know it. Charlie: You can't stop it. Construction starts next month, and ripping down the sign isn't gonna help anything. I didn't rip down any sign. And if you're caught, I'll see to it that you're prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law! Aw, you're talkin' like a bad movie, Charlie. I'm warning you, wilbur. Wilbur? It just seems so silly. I'm tellin' you, they asked for it. Really? Really. Now don't disappoint 'em. Come on. Yeah! Possums! All right! And now, the man who lead the possums to the playoffs, Mr. will Clark! Whoo-ooh! Both: Whoo! Well, uh... I don't quite know what to say. Are you ready for some possum football?! I'm standing in front of radio station krig in nowata where the fate of the nowata possums is to be determined. Two 2-a state championship games are being played tonight-- the real one in Myers county, the fictitious one created by sports announcer will Clark. Bad news for the possums. Kevin burns is caught holding. That's gonna set 'em back 10 yards. Costly foul. Costly foul. Oh, come on! That wasn't holding. It's called a block. Will: ...For the possums. And with that failed pass, that'll bring an end to the third quarter. Prattville pirates 26, nowata possums 14. Will: Rowlett scrambles to his right, throws off one tackle, then another. He's got bond open in the flap. He spots bond. He lets it fly. It's going... Going... Going... And it's caught by bond. He's at the 15, the 5, and touchdown, possums! Go! Go! Go! Whoo! Possums! Will: There's the snap. Wait, it's the draw. Levitz runs to the right and heads down field to the 25. The 20... Go! The 15... Yeah! Yeah! The 10...The 5... Touchdown, possums! Yes! We've won the state championship! Whoo! Yeah, man! The history of nowata-- the possums have won the state championship! Yes! Yes! Yes! Possums! Possums! Possums! Possums! Possums! Sir. Sir. You better see this. What? Oh, no. Are you will Clark? Yes, I am. How dare you! How dare you steal the thunder from our state championship last night. What's that supposed to mean? Well, all you hear on television stations is how you won the state championship. We won the state championship last night. Well, I'm sorry, but I can't help that. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We got the TV cameras here. Why don't you admit nowata didn't win, prattville did, and we'll call it even. Afraid I can't do that, coach. No. No way! No way. Our team did win last night. Yeah! Yeah! You coward, you don't even have a team. Coward? Who you calling a coward?! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Hold on! Hold on! Break it up. Stop it, all of you! What's this all about?! They're claiming to be state champions. We are! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah. You couldn't beat us when you had a team, and you can't do anything about it now! Prattville team: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, you and your town are pathetic! Oh, yeah?! We could kick your butts tomorrow, no problem! We accept that challenge. Will, stop it! We challenge you to a game. Nowata versus prattville. Everybody just calm down. No problem. 2 weeks from today, and we'll give you home field advantage. Well, we'll be there waiting for you. Don't chicken out on us. We'll be here. Don't you worry! Wait--wait a minute. Wait. Wait. You can't do this. Will, you cannot do this. Why not? We don't have a team. Sure, we do. You don't have a stadium! The construction on the maxi mart begins next week! Well, make 'em change it! I cannot do that. Will: Sure, you can. You're the mayor, aren't you, Charlie? Yes, but i-- don't you understand?! We have a contract with these people. Team: Possums! Possums! Possums! Possums! Possums! Oh, my god, Elizabeth, what have I done? What have I done? It's called testosterone, m'love. I know. I know. Now I got the whole darn town believing we can win. We haven't beaten prattville in... We haven't ever beaten prattville. Coach: Aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa! Hut! Aw, come on, you guys! Blue 42! Hut! Come on! Hut! Damn! Red 17! Hut! Throw it to me. You're a fullback. Exactly. They'd never expect it. Fine. Ok... You miss it, it's your butt. Fake right and wheel out. On one. On one. Ok, ready, break! All: Break! Blue 17! Blue 17! Hut! Damn it! Well, at least we got a good defense. Will? Will, are you in here? It can't be that bad, can it? Worse. Maybe you should call John. What?! Your son. I'm not gonna drag him into this. I couldn't. All right. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Hut! What are you doing, Ron?! I'm playing football! No, you're not, because if you were, I wouldn't be draggin' my ass off the ground every play! All right? Get your lard-ass in gear and block for me! Come on! Come on! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, will. I'm having a private moment. Go away. Your wife said you'd be back here. Traitor. Well, I told her it's real important. I bet you did. I want you to call this thing off. Believe me, there's a part of me that would love to. Well, then, just go ahead and do it. Can't. You know, you and I both love this town, will. I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but if you go on ahead with this game, you're gonna destroy what's left of nowata's spirit. Y-you've built up this fantasy team that our boys just cannot possibly live up to. There is no way they can win. Show a little faith in your town for god's sake, Charlie. I don't know if nowata can stand another disappointment. And I just don't want to-- I just don't want it to end up like your son, will. I know what kind of team we have, Charlie... But for the first time in a long, long time, this town believes it can win. And who knows... Maybe we will. Now, do yourself a favor. Get off my porch, and don't your ever, ever, mention anything about what happened to my son around me again. You're not only hurting yourself, will... You're gonna shatter the dreams of all the people in this town. Kid: Hello, will. London: Possums by 3. Oh, come on, London, you gotta be joking me. They're gonna win by at least 2 touchdowns. I got 20 American dollars that says so. Hey, you want in on this, will? Bob started a pool on how badly we're gonna cream the pirates. Aren't you suppose to be in school, son? In a minute. I'll take the possums by 7. Ok, hand it here, Earl. Ok, he gave us his milk money. Jake: Excuse me, sir, is there anything I can help you with? Young man: Oh, no, thanks. I just need to speak with Mr. Clark. Oh. Hey, will... Hi, dad. Your mother just can't let things be, can she? Actually, I heard about it on the news. Uh, nowata's statewide. Really? Yeah, yeah. And, uh, mom told me. That's what I thought. Yeah, well, she, uh-- she mentioned that you might need some help coaching the team. Well, she got that wrong. We're doing just fine. Aw, come on, dad, she told me. Hell, she doesn't know what she's talking about. Well, prattville's got a great team this year. Hell, you think I don't know that? Look, we're doing fine. Besides, this is something that I don't want you to get involved in. And why not? Because I'm telling you it's not, all right? End of discussion. No, no, no. I'm sorry, why is it that whatever you say always goes, huh? You know, I don't have time to stand here and argue with you about this. I've gotta work on these plays. Now, I appreciate you stopping by, but I don't want any of your help. No. Really, fine. Glad to see some things never change, huh? Oh, oh, by the way, next time you want to stop by one of my practices, why don't you say hello? That is, if it's not too much of an imposition. John. John, wait up. John... I've bitten off more than I can chew here, son. If I drag you into this and we fail-- and there's a high likelihood we'll fail-- then what I did to you before-- dad, come on. I don't blame you for that. No, maybe you don't. Hut! All right! Hi. Hi. You're looking good. Yeah. So, what position do you play? I, uh-- I hold the ball. What? Well, when the kicker tries for a field goal, I hold the ball. You're a holder. Well, it's also, like, backup quarterback. You're a holder. Go possums! Whoo! Will: John... Thanks. Talk to me after the game. Go possums! Go possums! Yeah! Go, possums! Yeah! All right. Hey, will! Hey. We're gonna cream 'em tonight! Heh heh heh. Here, will, I made you something. Aw, thanks, Bob. Good luck. Thank you. Heh heh. Hi, will. Charlie. You remember Pete and Bob from the maxi mart, don't you? Yes, I do. Referee: You call it, nowata. Heads. Heads. What do you elect to do, nowata? We'll receive. All right, shake hands. Have a good, clean game. Will, over P.A.: Good evening, folks. Welcome to another exciting evening of possum football. We've got a capacity crowd here in nowata tonight as the teams line up for the kickoff. Will: And there it is. It's taken at the 23 by the possums' Mark parham who looks right all the way to the 32-yard-line before he's brought down by prattville. Whoo! What a nice return by bond, and a great beginning field position for the possums. On the lineup, possums' Mark bond is wide right. Paul rowlett takes the snap, pitches it back to Eric pryor, who finds a hole off-tackle and runs for a 5, 10, 15-yard gain. Wow, what a play by the possums, and what great blocking by that offensive line. They broke a hole wide open for pryor. Unbelievable. Set! Blue 14! Possums on the 48. Rowlett searches for his man and gets it away just before he's hit by prattville. Holy smoke! John Cox makes a great catch down at the 12. What a team we're seeing tonight, folks, the possums, after just 2 plays, are a breath away from a touchdown as they line up at the 12. Here's the snap. Rowlett scrambles back, barely gets one to pryor. Oh, no! He's hit hard and the ball is loose, scooped up by prattville. He's running. The 30, the 40... He's dragged down at the 45 by Kevin burns. Close call there for the possums as prattville takes possession of the ball. Great play by burns. Best we've seen all season. Watch, watch. It's just a fluke. We'll get 'em next time. Yeah, we'll get 'em. Go possums! Yeah! Go possums! Come on! Whoo! Man in motion. Prattville's Stanley horton takes the snap, drops back, guns a bullet to Mark Haggerty. He's hit hard at the 32, and he fumbles! The possums come up with it on their own 27. I'll tell you, folks, these kids are scrapping over the ball like ducks on a June bug. This could turn out to be one heck of a game. 3! 53! Hut! Whoa! He's sacked for a big loss! Third and 6 at prattville's 37 yard line, folks. Uh, possums need a break here late in the second quarter. Hut! Rowlett back to pass, and from the right prattville's big Brian bill chases him and fumbles! No one's gonna stop him as he's across the 30, 20, the 10. Touchdown, pirates. All: That's ok, that's all right, get in there and fight, fight, fight! 6 to nothing with only seconds remaining, folks, as prattville lines up for the extra point. There's the kick, and it's blocked by possums' Jason Caldwell! The possums come up with the ball on the 13 and at the last 2 seconds take it away. That'll end the first half. Unbelievable, folks, as the nowata possums have managed to hold off the state champion prattville pirates to a meager 6-point lead. The prattville pirates state champions. You are an embarrassment. You stink! I'm embarrassed. Aren't you embarrassed? My god, play like that the first half, state champions? They didn't play a football game all year long, and they're kicking our rear end! Been together for 2 weeks! Hear me! We gotta play better the second half! They're embarrassing us. You can't go back to prattville! I can't go back! We can't go back to prattville if we don't win this game! You gotta make something happen the second half. You gotta go back out there and get at their butts. And play harder. Let's get it done, man. Let's go, man! Will: Well, it was an amazing first half, folks, as the possums held off a well-known prattville offense. And with the entire second half to play, who knows just what these possums might have in store for us tonight. Come on, boys! You the ones! You the ones! Give me 5! 5! 5! Come on, guys! You can do it! You can do it! Will: The prattville offense sets up for the kickoff. You know they've got to be disappointed so far. And there it is, the long, high kick down to prattville's 15. Sasser has it, and look out, he's at the 20! The 25, the 30. He's making this look easy. The 45, the 50! No one's gonna catch him. He's gone. Touchdown. Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Touchdown, pirates. But it's still early in the game, and, as we saw in the first half, the possums are really on tonight. Mark bond and John Cox set to receive. And there's the kick. It's a long one, deep into possum territory. Possums' Mark bond catches the ball, and he's hit hard! The ball pops free, and the pirates recover on the 3! Oh, no, this couldn't come at a worse time for the possums. They need to keep it together if they're gonna stay in this game. 44, hut! Hyuh! Hey, hey! Knock it off! Break it up! Break it up! Hut! Unh! Hut! Come on! You can do it! Hut! Hut! Will: Well, that's it for the third quarter, folks, and it's still a fairly close game, with the pirates only ahead by 27. We'll be right back after these messages. John. John! John...what the hell is going on? Dad, we're getting beat. Well, I can see that, but why? The whole first half-- dad, the first half, prattville wasn't playing like this, ok? Excuse me. Why don't you do something? Well, like what? Well, hell, I don't know. Well, hell, I'll tell you what. You think you can do better, you have at it. Listen, guys... I know we're down, but if you can just-- if... Aw, hell. What am I saying? You're doing great. I'm proud of you. Hell, the fact that you held these guys to 6 points in the first half is amazing. Yeah, well, now we're getting slaughtered. Sure, but you're doing better than last year. You were down 49 to nothing at this point. You guys are doing great, and with only 2 weeks practice. Now, a lot of that's due to-- a lot of that's due to John. I mean, he's the best coach that I've ever seen here. But a lot of it is due to you, too. You guys, you've got-- you've got so much heart. You've shown me that you belong on the field with these guys. Now I want you to stop paying attention to the scoreboard, get out there, and slaughter these guys. Get mean. Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! All, chanting: Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Get 'em! Break! Ok, now, come on, you guys! Let's get on 'em! Let's get on 'em tough! Hut! All right! We'll get 'em. We got 'em. What about, what about, what about our colors shout? Maroon! Maroon! Maroon! Maroon! White, white, white, white, white, white, white! Will: Third and 7, rowlett tucked tight behind the center. He looks left, then right. There's the snap, and he steps back. He's looking for a receiver. Rowlett scrambling as he can't seem to find anyone, and there's a break in the line, and--oh, no! What a hit. He is hummin' like a tenpenny finish nail hit with a greasy ball-peen hammer. Uh-oh, rowlett's not getting up, as coach Clark runs out on the field. It's not looking good for rowlett. With such an impressive drive for the possums, this couldn't come at a worse time, fans. Well, he's up, but he's not putting any weight on that right leg. Looks from where I'm sitting it might be his knee. Possums are forced to punt. It's high, travels only a few yards before it's picked up by prattville's Joe sasser. He easily evades the first line of possums and runs down the sideline to the 40, 45, the 50, the 40, the 37 yard line, before he's knocked out of bounds by center Ron foreman. Way to go, son! Wow! You'd never think that foreman could run that fast. Luckily for the possums, however, he kept prattville from scoring again. Pirate quarterback is deep, goes long for lumpkin, who's wide open! Oh, no! It looks like it's--it's-- it's intercepted? It's intercepted! Possum safety Darren gillerwater's intercepted the ball and is running. He's at the 12, the 15, the 20, where he's tackled at the 24 yard line! 17 seconds left in the game, folks. Possums rush out to the field. All right, Jake, in for Paul. What? In for Paul. Can't someone else-- come on, let's go. You're the backup quarterback. In there. Go! Coming in for rowlett is backup quarterback Jake Malloy, his first appearance tonight. Come on! Come on, Jake! Possums break from their huddle and head for the line. Prattville setting up for the blitz. I tell you, it's been an effective tool for them all night long. Malloy's a little cautious as he heads up to the line and... Blue, 32! Blue, 32! Hut! Malloy takes the ball, drops back to pass. He's hit hard at the 15. Uh-oh. Malloy isn't getting up. Jake, you all right? Huh? You ok? I'm fine. Yeah? I'm up. You're gonna be ok? I'm fine. Huddle up! And Malloy looks all right as he heads back into the huddle. 7 seconds left to play in the game. Think you guys can give me a little more protection? Sure. Good! Hope it's better than the last time. All right, this is it. Mark, it's up to you. I'm sending it deep. Throw it to me. I can get open. But you're a fullback. Exactly. They'd never expect it. Mark, you and Cox head out to split center. On one, on one. Ready? All: Break! Will: Just time enough here, folks, for one final play. Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Touchdown, possums! Touchdown, possums! Oh, no! Will: Oh, ho! I don't believe it! The first touchdown scored by the possums in 14 years! Good god almighty! That's my team! That's my team! Hey, ref, we won, didn't we? Yes, sir. You did. Hi. Hi. Can't believe it! Dad! Whoo! Yeah! We did it!
