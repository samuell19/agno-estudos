Tell them l've gone to Delhi on urgent work. - Are you going? - No. l told Malti l'd give her some pearls. And l was to take the other girls to a hotel after the party. - But l have no money. - What?

Papa, take me along!! That's very interesting. Love in the park and suicide when it is not reciprocated. But we've never heard of a man leaving a child here. - Where's your mother? - Papa knows. Listen to that. The man says he's unmarried, doesn't' know the child.. But the child says, he's the father and knows about the mother. - The child is his! - Yes. Be polite. As if you're being polite! Troubling an innocent man. Is it decency to leave your child behind? L've never seen him. He's forcing himself on me! Forcing himself? Why on you? Why isn't he calling us Papa? He could've latched on to me. - There's something fishy. - Two blows will make set it right - Don't mess with me. - Let's show him. Call the cops.

We'll eat at a hotel then go home. Leave the coat. l won't runaway. Hold my hand. - Be seated, sir. - No, we'll sit in. Get everything that is ready. Omelette, pastry, cutlet, cake.. - For you..? - Cold water. Sit here. Latched on to me.. - Couldn't you find another Papa? - L know you're my father. Father.. Get the food.

My darling son. - Ls there another way out? - At the back. Cant' you see? - L'm sorry.. - Forget it. Stop! Where are you running off? L've been looking for you. Now that l have you, you can't get away. - What have l done? - Forgotten? Don't' recall? You assaulted me in the war - l'll avenge that.. - Ls that so? - Yes. L've been looking for you for 200 years. Let's fight. - You have a smoke? - What? L'll get it from the shop. Don't go away Mr. Tomato, do you only travel in cars? Yes, l sat in the car when l didn't see you. - Very good. - May l come in front? No, thanks. Stay put. I can't jump out of a running car. - Come here later. - No.. - What are you eating? - What you gave me. It's delicious. Want to eat? You eat it. l'm only fated surprises. - Come in.. - Sit here. - L want your advice for a problem - What problem? Regarding Rita Gupta? L'd told you to be careful. - This is their business. - This is a new nuisance. This rascal of a child got after me in the park. - Wonder who is behind this. - But who is the boy? I asked him a 1000 times. You try your luck. - What's your father's name. - Say it properly. I made a mistake in telling him my name. He memorised it. - What are you staring at? - Son, who is this? - He's my Papa. - That's how he gathered a crowd! I kept saying, l don't know him but who pays any heed. So l had to come here. How do l get rid of him? Don't' keep secrets from lawyers l'm your friend. Frankly tell me what the matter is. - What do you mean? - Don't be angry. What did you do and when? Where did you hide him all along? I first saw him in the park l know nothing else! Why are you concerned when you don't know him at all? Hand him to the police then. Great idea. As if l never thought of it. He'll call me Papa in the police station and they'll call father.. L'll be in more trouble. He's already angry regarding Rita. - L know you well.. - Shut up! I don't need your advice. Golliwog, let's go. Yes, tomato! Come on. Did l wrong you somehow that you're troubling me? - What? - My head! - Where do l take you? - Let's go home. Sure, that's all that's left. All the problems of the world crash on my head. I don't understand where to take you. He'll tell father. - You're here? - Enjoying a picnic all alone? The mosquitoes are having a picnic - l've been waiting for you. - L was cooking. Got away finally But l can't stay long. Why? - What are you looking at? - Thinking of keeping you with me What are you looking at? You know your father. Will he agree? - He'll agree if l say. - No! It concerns our family honour. A singing teacher can't marry my son! I'm saying it for the last time this marriage will never take place! Don't pay any attention to him. We'll get married and stay alone. - That's not possible. - Why? Because marriage is a union of two families not just hearts. If your father won't accept me as your bride.. If they can't honour me, l don't want to marry you. - What are you saying? - This can't happen. It's best if we forget each other. Don't ever come to my house! You'll go mad like this. - Why would l go mad? - No, get up. - Let me be. You want to forget everything? Come with me. Hold him while l take a picture We'll make a fortune by showing this to his father. - Taking a picture? - No. Get me an umbrella. I want to go home. Why have you come? l said we must no longer meet. - Forget me. - L tried hard to forget - But l can't.. - You're drunk! - Have you stooped so low? - L'll stoop even lower if you.. This isn't possible. Go away. Whom are you calling? There's nobody here. - You want to go home? - Yes. - L'll take you home. You're thinking again l've.. I haven't come for that. I'm in trouble. Out of helplessness l came to you - lt's no big deal. - L know everything. - What do you know? - Go away. - Listen, l'm really in.. - Go away! Let's go. What do you want to say? - L'm worried because of him. - Who is the boy? Boy? He's more like my Pop. I want your advice if you won't feel offended. Come on in. - What is the matter? - Actually.. Stay put. Come that way.. - Sit down. - Don't runaway. - L wont' My sweet son! - Who are you? - L'm Tomato. - Where did you come from? - L came with Papa. - Where is your Papa? - Talking there. Don't' touch. Sit quiet. Let me see who has come. You spun a nice story but it's not convincing. Probably because it's not made up. - Look.. - Even after Rita's case? You have the wrong notion. You've no idea how had they are - Her father tried to blackmail me - l don't need to hear this. Why did you bring the boy here? I first thought of you in my moment of trouble. - Lf you keep him here.. - You want me to look after your son! - L can't do this! - How many times do l.. - Tell me where to take him. - To a children's home. Why don't you arrange to keep him there? I didn't think of that but this late Keep him here tonight. It's not so tough. Your father has gone to Delhi As for your aunt You can convince her. I can't spin tales. All right. L'll keep him for the night but take him away in the morning. Ganesh will be coming at 9 AM so before that.. My family wants me to marry him. - You're marrying Ganesh? - Yes. - Marrying..? - Yes. - That nincompoop..? - He's simple not sly like you. Ganesh will be furious if he finds that you'd come here. Don't worry, l'll be in time but.. You'd have dropped it! - L was looking at the fish. - You deserve to be spanked! - He's just a child. - Of course.. Such a good boy. I told you to be good. Why are you creating trouble? I must now leave. Can l have some water? - Sit down. Know who the woman is? - No.. - Mother. - My mom? Yes, l'm Papa. She's Mom. - Don't tell her. - Okay. L'll buy you toys. Then we'll play together. Feeling refreshed. L'll get you many toys. Has Kamal gone? Why didn't he take him? - He'll stay here tonight. - Here..? I think there's a trick in this. He came after so long and left this boy with you. - Something is fishy. - You're so suspicious! This is your weakness. Can't stand Kamal being criticised What l said is for your welfare. What did you just say? - Who told you l'm your Mummy? - Papa. - Be quiet. - Don't you dare! - L'll call you only mummy! - What a nuisance! - Who is this witch? Rascal! You called me a witch! Don't stoop to the child's level. You're a good boy. l'll give you a colouring book l don't want anything l want to go to Papa! - How stubborn! Needs a slap! - Don't beat me or l'll scream! - Then l'll beat you some more. - Papa, Mummy is beating me! - Be quiet.. - Papa! - L won't beat you. - You wont..? - Now go to sleep. - No first say you're my mummy.

No.. Troubling me since morning. - Papa is home! - Finally you've come. - Did he trouble you? - He's definitely your son. - Else he wouldn't be so stubborn. - Well, if that's what you think.. Why are you sitting? Take him and leave. - Did you get my motor cycle? - Shops were closed. We'll get it now - Mummy, l'm going with Papa. - Why did you teach him this? - What will people say? - The same that you're thinking. You're taking him but where will you keep him?

L'll be lifting such a heavy burdenOf marriage. - So l wanted to do business. - That's torn it. All my friends said, you're marrying me for my father's cash. - Really? - They poked fun at me They said Kamal will never love you They're jealous. l can't love those skinny girls. Let me tell you a secret. I had an aunt who was as healthy as you. That's when l decided to marry a girl like her. The others don't matter. I can't imagine my wife as a needle to be threaded.

She's getting married but l'll select the clothes, jewelry - You can't go there. - She was requesting me.. - Let me go just once. - Only tomorrow. Then l'll never let you go. I know about Usha.

You're an ass. - What are you if l'm an ass? - Tell me. I won't say it. L'll never come here. Why are you sitting? Take your son and leave. L'll send him out. The day was well spent. Now where do we go? - Take me to Mummy. - She wants to be rid of you. I want to go to her. We'll go to her. Guess who this is. You said Kamal had gone to Delhi but he's right here.

He's my Papa. See what your son has done! Shameless! Scoundrel! God knows whom he has married and when! I always knew your son would be a blot to my name! Where is the brat gone! Don't yell.

I know nothing else. - Quiet! - Liar! - Listen to him. - You won't let him speak. - He's blatantly lying. I got into trouble so one lie led to another. He's really not my son. He calls me Kamal the Great. Who calls his father Great? Somebody taught him. He's mad. I don't believe a word. L'll advertise in the papers. - His family will claim him. - L'll be glad to get rid of him lf nobody comes for him in 7 days, l'll think he's your son And then l'll show you!

Your Mummy. What are you doing? Playing..? Where's your Papa? He's not at home. Why don't you come here? Why don't you come? Ask Papa to bring you to Mummy l'll do that but first you come here. will you come today? What are you doing? Who are you talking to? - To Mummy. - Mummy?? We advertised for nothing. I knew this is Kamal's son. Tomato just called a call. - From whom? - Kamal's wife, who else! - What? - Yes. l asked who it was.. - Know what she answered? - What? - Nobody. - What do you think? - About what? About the boy. ls he really Kamal's son or.. Can't you see? His eyes are just like yours. You're nuts. His eyes are just like yours. - Listen to me. - Why? Can't l see? lt's clear his eyes are like yours. His nose and chin is mine. You're wrong. l looked closely.. - Eyes like you, nose like mine - As if l didn't notice. - Nose.. - l don't' want to argue. Let's eat something. - L'm not hungry. - Why not? He says he's not hungry. Don't force him. He'll fall sick. I told you not to grow close He might not be Kamal's son. Somebody might come for him Then you'll cry all your life. I'm saying it because kids feel hungry at intervals. I know. Wasn't l also a child? - Will you eat with me? - Yes!! You won't eat now? No..? L'll show you when you come to me. - Grandma! - Come here.. Where does your Mummy stay? She stays near the big road. - How is she? - Very beautiful. She sings and dances. Shall l show you how? Aunt, the ad has come again. It's come everyday for 6 days. Meaning nobody has come for the child. Who would come. There is nobody. I guessed from his words that he has no mother. - What do you think? - How would l know? How would you know? I asked what do you think? I don't think. You get angry at everything l say. So l keep getting angry at you? Forget about Kamal, what's wrong with his parents? They know it's Kamal's son yet they want to throw him out. They want Kamal to marry the fatso and keep his dowry. The family is alike! I won't be angry. Say something. - Okay..yes. - The fault is Kamal's. Not the boy's. ln a day or so they'll take him to the orphanage. I feel like going to their house and giving a mouthful to the old man. What fun!! - Where's grandma? - Upstairs. Shall l call her? - No! - You bought these for me? - Yes, all for you. This horse too.. If you stay here, l'll get you a real horse tomorrow. This is a toy car. L'll get you a real one! Tell meif somebody comes for you.. - Will you leave me? - No. - No? Great! How are you? The oaf said a lady has come. lt's only you. I thought somebody came seeing the advertisement. You want to see Kamal. He's home. Call the master. I didn't come to see Kamal. I came regarding the ad. Why? What's that got to do with you? L've come to take Tomato. To take him..l mean.. I don't understand.. I see. Nobody came for 6 days.. So Kamal cooked up a new plan and sent you here. I know you guys well. Don't act smart with me. I see through everything l have nothing to do with Kamal's schemes. L've only come to take Tomato. Why will you take him? What right do you have? Consider me..his mother. Tomato's mother So you married Kamal? - L didn't marry anyone. - What nonsense! Have you no shame at all? Didn't get married and..what proof that Tomato is your son? Where had you gone? Why didn't you come all these days? Do you need further evidence. Trust you have no objections now No. But just as he calls you Mummy, he calls somebody papa We just take his opinion. He hasn't come as yet..? - Son.. - Did you call me? Yes..Usha wants to take Tomato. - Why? - As if you don't know Because she's his mother. Why should we object if the mother wants her son? The father's opinion doesn't count. His father says Tomato stays here! - You're being obstinate. - Lf you're his Mummy - l'm his grandfather. - But.. - Be quiet! Tomato calls you Papa and her Mummy and you say you're not married - Listen to me.. - What will people say? I won't tolerate this. The decision must be taken now what will your relation be? Come with me. Leave that. We'll ride a cycle. You weren't satisfied with insulting me in your house. - You came here to put me down. - That's not the issue. - How did l insult you? - You did! You know Tomato calls me Papa. Why did you tell Dad you're his mom? You can't understand this. If you did, another girl.. Anyway, let it go. You want to get rid of Tomato. Advertising in papers. What's the harm if l take him? He may not be my son. L'll rear him as your son. My son! All of you will drive me nuts! - How do l explain he's not my son - You can't do that. - Why? - The man who keeps going around with loose women.. There you go again! Who is responsible for it? You! - Me..? - You alone! Nobody could have misled me if you were with me. Nobody would dare.. Shut up! This nuisance took away what little peace l had! Go away! l'm not your Papa! - You're not my Papa..? - No! - Get out of here! - Why are you beating him? It's my fault. A strange child addresses me as Papa. It's my fault that Rita's father black mailed me. Life always laughs at me else you'd believe me. You know as well as me l would do no wrong. Yet you You cared about your honour. Father cares about the family name Who cared about me? The walls of your honour grew higher by the day. Did you ever think of what l felt, trapped in these walls? Don't you understand l can't live without you? I did all this only to forget you. But l couldn't forget. The more you drew away, the closer l came. But you..what do you want to say? I don't want to say anything. I won't let you go. Father has no objections. Do you agree..tell me.. L've troubled you a lot.. - Where are you going? Come.. - L won't! - You're not my Papa. - But l am. - Stop crying. - You're not my Papa. - l am.. No..stop crying. God knows who his parents are but when he calls me Papa.. And you his mother. We do consider him our child l found you thanks to him. Let's go home.
