We're here, Rosa! - Rosa... - Rosa! - What's she doing? - She didn't see the finishing line. - It's over! - She didn't see the finishing line. - Go after her. - Rosa! ROSA'S WEDDING This goes here... No, this one. Alright, this one. This one. Morning, Rosa. Hello, Ana. They're not bad. - A|| this is from the warehouse? - Yes. Anyway, we may need more. They called yesterday, they want a big scene on a shoestring budget, always the same. - I'm going. I'll be the control room. - Okay. Good morning. - Hello, Elvira. Good morning. - Good morning. Hello. Girls, the wedding stuff... is on that rack, okay? Get dressed, you have to be ready by a quarter to. - Yours is in a hanger at the back. - Okay. Yes, yes. Hold on, I'll pull it, okay? It looks amazing on you. No, I let it out. I let it out, yes. Look, it's here. I hung it up here. - It's kind of like we discussed. - Yes, totally. Different colors and styles, right? For something fresher, - more innovative. - I love it. This is great, I love it. It's got an elegant touch. Do you like it? I love it. Thanks, Ana. I'm glad. Open this up for me. This too. This one. Coats? - Hi, Mum. - Hi, honey. - I've got two calls from you. - Yes, we haven't spoken for days. - How's everything? - Good, great. You look a bit tired. The twins take turns keeping me up all night. How's everything? How's work? - I quit my job, Mum. - What? Yes. It wasn't worth it. I'll tell you later. But Lidia, how can it not be worth it, even if it was just three day? You cut loose enough by going to Manchester. You'll really be out of it if you quit work. Mum, please. I'm begging you, really. I've told you a thousand times not to run my life. I'm going, I'm with the kids. We'll talk some other time, okay? Lidia... It's Armando, your brother. I can't get on time with the kids tonight. Please give them dinner and put them to bed before 10, okay? Thanks. You're so sweet. Ciao. Kids! There's no cereal. We don't understand a word! - You don't understand me? - No. No. Aunt Rosa's will give you dinner. At 9:30, go to bed. Rosi, dear. Laura! Rosi, sweetie. Thanks a bunch. Toni, listen: Be good with Rosi. Sweetie, I'm going to miss you too. I brought you this bag and her blankie, her toy... OK. Relax. Relax. - Have fun. - Well, honey... - You relax. - Okay. - Thanks. - Have a good time. - 'Bye. - Love you. Thanks. 'Bye. Hi, Toni! Yes, Rafa? Yes, I went yesterday. Beautiful. They've only tiled one part... But I told them to tile it all the way up, Rosa. It's beautiful, the man told me it's... Yes, it's more modern, that's the thing now. I'll call him, I'll speak to him, but... come around to the flat and watch he does it properly. Yes, Rafa, later. I have a work thing now, I'll drop by later. Yes, I love you too. ARMANDO, THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP THANKS, SISTER! RAFA, I WAS AT YOUR HOME. THEY'RE GOING TO TILE IT ALL. THANKS, HONEY. My girl, you're impossible to catch. It's to tell you I've been thinking about something. Call me. WATER EVERY FOUR DAYS GONE FOR 20 DAYS. LEAVE YOU THE PLANTS. LOOK AFTER THEM. THANKS A LOT! Mother of God... Rosa, honey, the party's been brought fonlvard. It's tomorrow. I know you left late, but there'|| be 150 extras, plus the actors... WATER EVERY DAY TWO GLASSES Rosa, it's Mercedes. Just reminding you that your dad has tests with us this week. We told him too. Alright. Dad, what are you doing here? You sure do get home late. We said you'd come over the weekend. Right. SQ? I don't like being alone at home, Rosita, you know that. - Sure. - I've been thinking, - let's see what you think. - Yes. Since Lidia is gone and her room's empty, I'm moving here. - What? - I coming here! I like being with you. Instead of coming for lunch now and then, going back and forth, with two kitchens, two fridges, two shopping trips, I move in and we'll be together. Dad, you can't move in here. Visit as often as you like, but then you go home. I'm barely here, Dad. You see? That's why. I move in, lend a hand, and you go about your business. - Look, I vacuumed the floor. - Right. And I ran some errands, your fridge was empty... And I went to the meeting, the landlord came by. - Shit, that was today! - Don't worry. I told him everything was great. How can you tell him that? The place is falling apart. Let's not be conflictive, my girl. - I'm going to bed. - You can't move in, Dad. Why not? - Because... - Is there a problem? - Dad... - We'll be great here. You'll see. I left you some fish for dinner. - Tell me tomorrow, eh? - Wait. Churros for breakfast tomorrow. You'll see how great it'll be together. Right, see you tomorrow. Rosa, the colors are fine, but they'll all needs alterations. Oh, they still haven't solved the laundry issue. You have to take it all home again, honey. "I vow to take care of you,". I vow to respect you, I vow to love you. I vow to always be with you, in good times and bad. I vow to be faithful... all the days of my life... till death do us part. - Dad. - Hi. Good morning. Where are you? I see you didn't have the fish. Something urgent has come up and... we're shooting out of town. I'll be away a few days. You should stay at your place and I'll tell you when I'm coming back to Valencia. Gosh, that's bad luck. Just when... - Sure. - You know. Well, I hope it goes well. Tell me when you're coming back so I can move in again. Remember you have blood tests this week. Get a taxi. I'll ask Armando or Violet to go with you. I like going with you. That's what I like, and after go for breakfast together, churros. But both of us. Sure, Dad, me too. - I hope it goes well. - Big kiss. YOU HAVE TO TAKE DAD FOR SOME BLOOD TESTS, I CAN'T people of all ages, to identify the symptoms. It can save our lives and anyone with us at the time. The main symptoms are: Trouble speaking, trouble walking, headache, confusion... With any of these symptoms, it's essential to call Emergencies and act quickly. Armando, I'm working. You've called me 15 times. What's wrong? Listen, Violeta, Dad has to be taken for some blood tests. Why doesn't Rosa go? It won't take more than an hour. I can't, my week is so hectic. Listen, I have to go, I'm busy. Okay, ciao. Armando... Armando! What a pain in the ass! Rosita! Mum! Mum! What are you doing? THIMBLELESS SEAMSTRESS, SEWS POORLY AND SEWS LESS “ AMAP OLA“ DRESSMAKERS. The seamstress... - What did she say? - That they're cutting staff. Marisa hears lots of things and finds out everything. No one's being fired. Rosie! I've been calling and nothing. Where'd you get to? It's about Dad, honey. I'm in the middle of a conference. It's such bad timing. He can go by himself. We'll send him a taxi, okay? Call me and we'll see. - Where do you think you're going?! - Home, Violeta. Home? No way. Marilé! One, two, three, four, five... seven gin and tonics! _Hey! _Yes! Where are you? Do me a favor and come whenever you can. There's all the new stuff from the warehouse, we can't dress the extras. Listen, Rosa, it's Rafa. The electrician told me he's stopping by at home. Maybe you can drop by, okay? We can have dinner after. Rosa, I can't make it with the kids today either. If you do me this favor... Marga's taking them on Sunday. If you give them dinner and put them to bed... So? What do you think? I think it's foolish. A|| this can be turned into classrooms, - four more classrooms. - It'll cost you a fortune, Armando. Not a fortune, don't exaggerate. It won't be free, but I'd just have to pay a bit more than I do already. Sure, and how? A second mortgage and I'll sell the workshop. - Your mother's workshop? - Mum's workshop. - Have you spoken to the others? - Yes. Well, no. Not yet, but I'm sure they'll agree. Rosa's broke, she could use the money. Violeta already wanted to sell it and I don't think my dad cares. The workshop is closed, it's a dump. They'll say yes. I did the numbers and I can make it work. No, Armando, you won't. Marga, I've got it all under control. You can't cope with the classes you have already. - I hardly teach any classes. - Because you have no time. And you want to expand. You have Rosa's help with the kids, otherwise... The kids don't want for anything. Healthy food, good education... Can't be better. Can't be better... By the way, Marga, I also wanted to say... We're doing great and I know you need time and space and I respect that. - But how long will it take...? - The divorce time? Divorce, Marga... You needn't be so dramatic. We're giving ourselves some time. I have to go. We'll talk. But I made a reservation at Casa Agusti. - Armando, goodbye. - But Marga... Carlos! What's going on here? Nothing. - Where's Rosa? - I don't know. - Didn't she come? - No. - She didn't come? - No. Go on, off to bed. Off to bed. LIFE DOESN'T END AT 50 URINE LEAKAGE? LOW SEX DRIVE? FLACCIDITY? LET'S TALK MENOPAUSE. - That's it, he's coming out. - Okay. What do you think? Is he getting over the hyperactivity? I don't know. Is something wrong with him? No, no. Your father's in terrific health. No, the tests are just to watch his overall levels. But this need to do things can be a symptom, do you understand? I told your sister, you have to keep watch. Alright... Sometime with a major loss, we cover up our grief. But my mother died two years ago. Right, but you can't measure grief like that. It's not serious, but keep an eye on him. - Don't leave him alone. - Dad! - Antonio, take care of yourself. - Okay. - Yes. - Shall we get some breakfast? Don't you have to get back to work? I got another hour off so we can spend time together. No, there's no need, I'll have breakfast at home. - Hi, how are you? - Hi! - Where's Rosa? - She's not here. - She's not? - Let's try to get everyone organized... If you know what you're wearing, get it from the hanger, okay? - Put the cardigan on. - Please, I need you to help me. Who's left? Who's left? Who's ready? - Ana, is not here. - Ana, Ana, Ana. - 10 minutes! - 10 minutes, okay, yes. Just a moment! Rosa, where are you? Ana, I'm not in Valencia. Don't wait for me. Where on earth are you? This is chaos. I can't find anything and you have the wedding clothes. Ana, I'm not coming back, don't wait for me. - Has something happened to you? - Yes. What do you mean? - No, nothing's happened to me. - What are you saying? Don't wait for me. Ana, find someone else. Rosa... I'm leaving the house. I called the landlord, Laura. Wild, honey! I think it's great. A change of life, of neighbors, and change of karma. You've hit the nuclear button. Exactly, a complete change. And to start this new life, I want to do something special, like a ceremony. And I want it to be on the beach, in Benicassim. Can you come, Laura? Yes, I'll be there. What are you going to do? I'm going to marry myself, Laura. Yourself? I don't get it. Never mind, you'll understand. I just want you to come, Laura. I need you there with me. Sure, honey. I'm there, I'll do whatever you want. But, are you alright? I'm great. I'll put Toni on. Yeah, yeah, sure. - Look, Toni. Look who's here. - Toni, sweetie. - Well, I'll leave you. - God, you're beautiful, gorgeous. Are you happy? Are you looking after Rosi? That's it, that's it. I'm coming. Mummy's coming. - Hi, Lidia! - Hi, Mum. How are you? - Is it a bad time? - It's fine. It's a good time. What are the little ones up to? They're about to eat. I wanted to apologize about the other day. I was very tired. Hold on a sec, Mum. It's done, honey. Lunch is here. Look. Oh, honey... Mum, don't worry about that job. It wasn't worth it. I'll find something better. - Want some, honey? - Sure. How are you? Great, great. And how's John? He's gone for three days, he had some gigs. Here, honey. How are you? I'm good, sweetie. Great. I have so much to tell you. I really wouldn't know where to start. Hold on a sec. No, honey, not the plate. - No, not like that, no way. - You could come for a few days, no? When were you thinking of coming? I don't know, Mum. The tickets are expensive now. September would be better, that way the four of us can come. Come now, I'll help you with the tickets. Mum, really, no. I don't want you giving me more money, I owe you loads. You don't have to give it back, please, I don't mind. But I do, I do mind. One moment. Lidia, I miss you so much, honey. Oh, chubby cheeks! Mum, I have to go, I'm a little bit tied up here. I'll call you some other time, okay? - Say bye-bye to Grandma. - I miss you so much. - All of you. - We miss you too. Right? Oh, jeez... I'm not going back. - Fuck, that's a bit much. - Rafa, I'm tired of lots of things. I'm even thinking of opening up my mother's workshop. - What? The workshop? - Well, I don't know yet. I'm mulling it over, but... - Oh, one thing. - Yes. I'd like you to come to Benicassim, it's very important to me. Rafa, we've got a real hassle over one of the tables. I'm coming, Carmen. One sec. I'll be right there. Be right there. Let me speak. - You didn't let me speak. - You look beautiful. My God, you look so beautiful! - Rafa... - Rafa, sorry, - There are loads of people. - I'm just asking for one minute. - What do I do with them? - I'll be right there. One second. Look, it's a shitstorm here. When I'm done I'll go to Benidorm and we'll talk. - Benicassim, Rafa! - Benicassim. I love you, Rosa. - I love you loads. - You didn't let me speak, Rafa. In Benicassim. Almost ready, Carmen. You wanted table 8? It's written there. - Open the workshop? - Yes. Aren't you excited? I don't know. There is no business there. There aren't enough customers in such a small town. And there's Enriqueta's shop, - clothes for parties and brides. - Right. Though... your mother would've loved the idea. She always sat there, at the courtyard window... with her dresses, her things. Until she'd finished, there was no stopping her. So, would you approve of it? If you want to... What can I tell you? Sure. But you'd have to help me get started, Dad, like you did with Violeta and Armando. But your mother and I helped them because we had some savings. Now I only have the pension. - You have your half of the workshop. - That's true. With your half and mine I've got almost everything. I could speak to Violeta and Armando and pay for their share later on, when I can. But... We helped them because they were starting a new life. I want to start a new life. - They were getting married. - What if I got married? Then, yes, of course. It'd be fair. Can you make a ring from this? I think so. One moment. I vow to... I vow to... respect myself. I vow to... MUM - Hello. - I didn't know you were here. My mother told me to come and clean, your brother called her. - My brother? - Yes. That's all she said. But I see you've got it all sorted. - Excuse me, who are you? - Lolin, Paca's daughter. Paca's daughter! You are so grown! - Gosh, that is pretty. - Really? - Is it a skirt? Did you make it? - Yes, I did. It's a kind of over skirt. It's gorgeous. Gorgeous. - Sure, you make dresses. - Yes. - Like your mother. - Yes, like my mother. It's not exactly like the red one, but it's alright, isn't it? - I love it! - Wait, there's the finishing touch. Oh, Rosa, I love it! Will you take a photo of me? Okay, a fortnight's notice for objective dismissal... - Fine, bring me your FC. - What? Your Dependent Self Employed Worker Contract. And don't worry, since half of your income has always depended on the agency, even if the contract's broken, we can get good compensation. I didn't even know that contract existed. - No? - No. In that case, we have to sue the agency. I'm getting a drink. FAMILY, I'M GETTING MARRIED SUNDAY. EVERYONE COME TO BENICASSIM. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm leaving the clothes, Armando. - Hi Dad. Right, 'bye. I'm going. Wait, wait. Marga, you're going already? - Yes. - Hold on, don't go. - What...? - Kids, go to your room. - 'Bye Mum. - 'Bye. Excuse me, one moment. Dad. Yes, I know. No, it's the first I've heard of it. I don't know, it must be to Rafa, that boyfriend of hers. We've arrived. We're here. 'Bye, Dad. Wait, Marga. Stay, this is... family time. Armando, it's "Marga time". The thing is... Rosita, Violeta tells me that you're getting married. Is it true? Good heavens! That's wonderful! It's a huge surprise! You mentioned it the other day, but... I didn't think it'd be so... all of a sudden. - A|| of a sudden! - Rosa's getting married? - No warning, no... - Congratulate her for me. - Well... - I'm going. 'Bye. Okay, 'bye. We're here. Hello! Is anyone home? Congratulations, girl. Big kiss. Surprise! Alright, honey. Here we are. That's it, that's it. Honey, stop crying. Bruno, honey, please. - Sweetie! How are you? - Mum? - How are the kids? - Good, good. Mum, what is all this? Where are you? I'm in Benicassim. - I'm at home, in Valencia. - Valencia? How did you get there so soon? Why didn't you tell me? I would've picked you up. I wanted to surprise you, Mum. - What's this about you getting married? - Well... yes... kind of... Anyway, I'll tell you when you get here. You can't stay there. Go to your aunt Violeta and you can come with Armando. Honey, you have to tell them. I know, Laura, I know. But I don't know if they'll understand. They might even run off. And I need them there with me. I need them to listen to me, to understand me. Do you understand me, Laura? Alright, Laura, please. It's like when a normal couple gets married. They vow to love and respect each other. Well, that's it, but with myself. I think I see it. That's what I need my brother and sister to do, to see it. And above all to see themselves with my father. Hey, little brother! You look great. You look... "more", right? Hi! - How are you, honey? - Good, good. I'll leave this here for you. - How's the barracks? A|| in order? - Terrific. - And you? Lots of work? - Loads. And John? Isn't he coming, Lidia? Thanks for coming. Sorry it's been all so sudden. A bit. You've known Rafa, how long, a few months? You are very much in love, huh? But how can you marry tomorrow, if there's the paperwork, telling people, organizing it...? There's no need, it's not what you think. There's no need. Besides, I don't want to wait, I want to start a new life. Sure. How long have you been thinking about it? Two weeks. - Gosh, Rose, such passion! - And you're coming here with Rafa? - That's... - Rosa, don't be old-fashioned. Nowadays couples get married but they have their own place. You won't have to put up with some man's dirty socks. "Everyone in their own house and God in all of them", Mum said. It's true. "Thimbleless seamstress, sews poorly and sews less". - Then there's Dad. - Exactly. I wanted to talk about that. - You'll have to look after Dad. - Of course. We have to get him, tell him the exact time, not let him get muddled... - And tell more people, time's short. - You don't have to tell anyone. My Wedding's going to be intimate and private. Weddings aren't intimate and private. Weddings can be whatever one wants, no? - And how do you want it? - I'd like it at the cove. - At the cove? - At the cove? Like goats, amid the rocks? Rosa... - Rosa, please! - However small it is, it has to be nice. You don't get married every day. - Sure, but it's not... - Rosa, don't worry. Even though it's a bit rushed, we'll organize everything. First and foremost, the Town Hall... Town Hall? No, Armando, I've thought it through. - Thought what through? - It's a surprise. - Surprise us at the Town Hall. - Armando, please! - It won't take a moment. - You're not calling... Please! - No. - Don't cry! Look, look, look! - You don't do that. - Don't cry! Confirm it for me. Okay. - Brilliant. - Look. - Don't take it off your brother. - Listen to me. - All sorted. - Listen for a second. Two weeks ago, Dad decided to move in with me. - Let's finish the last two calamari. - Let's get another bottle. Young man! - Aren't you drinking a lot lately? - Do I tell you that you eat a lot? - Guys, did you hear me? - What, Rose? Two weeks ago, Dad said he was moving in with me. Now and then, Dad likes being with you. Now and then? I've had Dad stuck on me like a barnacle for two years. But two weeks ago he told me he's moving in with me but permanently. Well, you said no, I imagine. I didn't have the courage. That's what I wanted to say, you have to look after him too. Come on, Rose, Dad has his home. But he doesn't want to be there. It brings back memories, he gets sad. We have to take turns to keep him company. You can spend some days with him too, right? Me? Now? Impossible. I can't, Rose. Not now. Rosa, he can't stay at my place. I've got a sofa-bed. He can stay one or two nights, maximum, but no longer. Or we could get someone to mind him, keep him company. - It's not that, Armando. - Rosa, please. Dad's fine. The nurse told me so the other day. Yes, he's a bit sad, like everybody, but... he's not impaired or senile. Okay? Someone stepped on some crap, right? - What a rank smell. - Did they do a poo? - Shall I help you? - No. Wait, I'll go. - You're going? - That's what aunts are for. Let's go. Come to auntie! He's so heavy! Andre's. Andrés, just a second. - Andres, at the real estate agency. - What real estate agency? I brought the deeds to the workshop. - That's why you wanted to clean it? - We'll discuss it later. What do you want to do with the workshop? What? I'll tell you later, okay. Congratulations, Rosita. Andre's, what's up? I was just talking about it with my sister here. Yes, go ahead. Tell me. - Armando, listen to me. - Yes? You have to go to Enriqueta, the wedding dress lady. I've spoken to her. Rosa has a dress ready there, she's to try it on, and do any alterations, I'll take care of it. If there's anything - you like, I'll get it as well. - Us? Rosa's getting married, son. - We have to look decent, no? - Yeah, sure. Hey, is Marga with you? No, she'll come tomorrow, I guess. Listen, Dad, I'm going, okay? - See you later. Big kiss. - Right. See you tomorrow. Carlos. How are you, son? Jeez, Dad, it's "screen time". Well... Are you alright? Yes. How are things in Benicassim? Fine, organizing your aunt's wedding. Oh, cool. Yes. Carlos, is Mum there? No. - Did you tell her to call me? - Yes. Won't she even talk to you? - Of course. - Right. - Didn't you say you had it sorted? - It's all going great, Carlos. Don't sweat about anything. Don't worry, it's all going great. Hey, auntie, how long have you known? About the wedding? Since today. Do you leave the kids to soak like chick peas? They look pretty crinkly to me. I've got loads of ideas and also... Lolin told me... You know, Paca's daughter? Lolin is sure that her friends would love dresses like these, like the one I made for her, because apparently here, in the small towns, there are loads of weddings. Five or six a year. And Lolin said that if I charge 60 or 70 euros, - they'll sell like hotcakes". - But Grandma sold nothing here. - You've all told me that. - Yes. I'd have the workshop here, but I'd sell them on the Internet. - With what money? - I thought of getting a loan. Maybe it won't work, but if I don't try it, I'll never know. I've always wanted my own business, to make my own clothes. And your job? - I quit. - You quit your job? Sometimes you have to push the nuclear button and start from scratch. What "nuclear button" are you talking about? - Yes, tomorrow, when I get married... - Sure, I guess you and Rafa will come to live here. - We haven't talked about that yet. - You didn't talk to me either. What for, right? But you're in Manchester. It's what you wanted. You're living your life. Yes. Alright, Mum, congratulations. | hope you're very happy- Where are you going? I don't know, but I don't belong here, Mum. - Please, Lidia, what's this nonsense? - No, Mum. Fuck... I don't say or do nonsense and I'm sick to death. Of you thinking I do everything wrong. Sick of it. I'm sorry, sweetie. - Hey... - Mum! That's enough. Look, you live your life... - and I'll live mine. - Please... Leave me alone, please. I look like a fried green pepper. With egg... and black pudding. English breakfast. But... How long since you went to a gym or walked on the beach? I don't even have time to teach my classes. It's what I've always wanted to do and I can't even do that. How I'm going to get to the gym. Speaking of the school, since I'm asking for a loan, to do extensions and such, thought we could use the workshop as collateral or, if we all agree, - sell it. - Have you asked Dad? No, but I thought I'd make the most of us all being together. I know you're doing fine for money, but a little extra would be nice, no? Yes. - Rosie! - Isn't Lidia here? - Hello, Rosita, honey. - No, she'll be in the hotel. Your father called me this morning. He asked me to bring the store's most beautiful wedding dress. - It's his gift. - He did the same at my wedding, Rose. - Yes, but there's no need. - No? Why? Thanks, I already have an idea. I thought I'd wear Mum's dress. Mum's dress? It's prehistoric. And who knows where it is! I'll bring it to you. You'll look lovely, listen to me. - It's in the workshop. - It'll be grimy and motheaten. - Motheaten? - You have to look nice, it's your wedding. - Do it for Dad. Don't be like that. - But, hey... "Hey" nothing. Don't be like that. Try it on, it'll take a second. And be quick, they're waiting for us at the spa. - What spa? - I got you an hour, it's my gift. With all this improvisation I couldn't find anything better. I'm not wearing it tomorrow. - But Rosa... - Please, try it on. What do you care? We take a photo, Dad's happy and wear what you want. You relax, I'll go get Lidia. Let's go, Rosie! Rosa, your dad will be knocked out! Yes, for sure. Come on, Rosa! LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW Oh, Rafa, honey. Not now. Lidia, answer me, please. Listen, honey, I'm not marrying anyone, but I couldn't explain it to you. Tell me where you are. I'll get you and explain everything. Hello! Why weren't you at the store? Hello. We're meeting in the spa. If you want, you get going and I'll look after the kids. - What are you doing? - I'm going. Going where? What about your mum's wedding? I don't know, I don't know. What's wrong? It's like my mother's gone mad. Hey, honey. It's all a bit hasty, but if it's what she wants and it makes her happy... Sure, whatever she wants and fuck the rest of us. - Why do you say that? - She didn't tell me anything. Nothing. She didn't tell me she quit her job. Or about the wedding or that she'd stopped paying - the rent on our place. - What? - You didn't know either? - No. She says she's coming here to start a business. Honey, I have to take this call. It's crucial. But don't go. Wait a moment and we'll talk it over calmly. Wait a second. Isabel! I'm so glad you called. Yes, I'm listening. Wait a second, please. Please, Lidia, don't go. I'm begging you. Yes, I'm listening. I know the festival's in a few days, but I'm super-available if you need me. The Mad rid conference? Yes, of course I remember. Hey, I wasn't drunk. I drank a little, but... we all did. What behavior? The concierge? In the bathroom? Alright... Armando, have you spoken to Lidia? I left her a message, she'll be down. Look, I wanted to explain to you about the workshop, okay? - Lie down. - I don't want to lie down. - No, I'm in no mood for masks. - Rosa, lie down. - I don't want to lie down. - Lie down. You'll be a new woman, you'll see. Rosa, the workshop... - I need for us to sell it. - Sell it? Yes, well, if not then let me have it - as collateral for a loan. - Armando... I say "need", Rosa, because if you don't, I can't expand the school, understand? - The competition's killing us. - Sure, but... Besides, the workshop's there, it's doing jack shit, so... But you can't sell it, it's Dad's wedding present. Besides, I'm going to open it. Open it? What for? I'm starting a business, I need a loan. What do you know about business? I'll learn. No way, no. They helped you and Violet when you got married. Now's my time, it's my turn. I need it, Armando. - Look, Rosa... - Armando, no. You're acting strange, Rosa. Very strange. Have you seen Lidia? - She said she was going. - Where to? - It must be Manchester. - What? Violeta, please! Really, it's all terrible. What's wrong now? Is there no welcome champagne or...? The train for Valencia is leaving from Platform 1. Excuse me. PERSONALIZE YOUR T-SHIRT WITH YOUR FAVOURITE PHOTO No problem, my brother will be there tomorrow at 12... - Perfect. - For the photos. The usual? Bride and groom, individual portraits, with the family... A|| of it, we want all of it. Rosa didn't tell me anything. - Is that Armandito? - Yes. What are you doing here? Rosa's marrying tomorrow at the Town Hall. Rosa? Well, well. My daughter will be so happy, they were very close as kids. Listen, could we go see her at the Town Hall? Sure, sure. You're all invited. Carmina, it's Violeta. I just wanted to ask: This compensation about when can I get it? Marga, we have to talk. Call me, the Wedding's tomorrow. Tell me if you're bringing Dad and the kids... Please, just stay for the photo and then... go off and do what you like. MUM MISSED CALL Where did you get these photos? - My Facebook. - I'm in Fallas costume. How ghastly! - Look at this one. - Rosi! There she is. You have to help me. Don't worry about anything, it's all organized. And it'll be a blast. Pyrotechnics to beat the Fallas! Guys, you have to help me. Lidia's gone. - She's gone? - She got mad at me. How can she miss her mother's wedding? That doesn't matter. Please, Armando. - It doesn't matter? - It doesn't matter, Armando. What? Am I the only one who's taking this wedding seriously? Stop going on about the wedding! Please! I'm not marrying anyone. You're not marrying anyone? There's no husband, I'm marrying myself. Are you fucking kidding? No. - But how...? Is this a joke? - No. So we've gone to all this carry-on for nothing? No. Who's carrying on? You are, Armando. Me? Rosa, please... I just wanted a small ceremony and to tell you I'm not going back to Valencia. I'm staying here. You'll have to manage without me and look after Dad. So it's all a lie? No, it's not a lie. I'm getting married, but to myself. - To yourself? - To yourself? To myself. You're getting all gussed up to get married all alone? So, this wedding... You're not marrying anyone or going to live with anyone... - And this Rafa, does he exist? - Sure he exists. - Sure, but you're not marrying him. - No, I'm marrying myself. Yourself? Yourself? Oh, you're marrying yourself. A "Me Too" kind of deal. That is in fashion now, is that it? You know what, Rosa? Go pull someone else's leg, okay? You keep your wedding. I'm going to Valencia. I've got better things to do than look ridiculous at the Town Hall in front of everyone. Rosa, please! And you tell Dad when he comes. Let's see what he says, eh? What were you thinking? When were you going to tell us? At the Town Hall in front of everyone, is that what you thought? No, I wanted it on the beach. That was my surprise. But you've blown that for me too. Rosa, I don't get it either. Look, Violeta, you don't want to know about it. Since Mum died, Dad hasn't rebuilt his life, he's meddled in mine. All his hyperactivity to avoid facing the fact that he is alone. Since Dad said he's moving in with me, I've been thinking. I'm almost 45. When am I going to do what I want? What makes me happy, when? When will I think about me? When Dad stops needing me? Or when you stop needing me? When? Very well then. I don't know why you didn't just tell us straight out. Because I wanted to say it at the wedding. But now that you know, you can do what you like. And I'm so sorry for wasting your time. - Wait, Rose. - No, forget the "Rose" stuff. Well... I didn't know that Rosa was in such a bad way. Sure, compared to us, we're doing so great. Now where are you going? I'm sorry, Rosa. Forget it, Violeta, really. It's over, forget it. - No, I'm really sorry. - It's alright, it's over. I've been selfish. Is alright. And this wedding of yours? Why didn't you tell me? - You would've thought it was stupid. - Stupid, Rose? It's your wedding. You can marry a table for all I care. You would've had us all there. How could we miss a day like that? - You're the heart of the family. - Go on! Please, the heart... - I'm the bottom of the heap. - C'mon! You were the apple of Mum's eye, and now Dad's. However I try hard and speak three languages, it doesn't matter if I'm not around. But you vanished for a fortnight and look at the state of the family. It's all tops y-turvy, don't you see? That's the way it is, Rosa. It always has been. You're marrying yourself? It's great to see you! Yes. Yes. I'll explain, honey. Come here. I've made a mess of it. I'm so sorry. Forgive me, Lidia, please. I didn't make it easy for you either. No, but at least you came, which is the main thing. - But I didn't come for the wedding. - Then...? I came because I couldn't take it anymore, because nothing was turning out the way I'd hoped. I hardly see John... and I'm alone there all the time. - But why did you quit your job? - Because it was shit. And the pay was terrible. What little money I made I had to spend on day-care. So I stayed at home with them. But I swear I was just about to go mad, just about. If I'd stayed there any longer, John and I would've ended badly. So... you've come to Valencia to stay? I think so. John and I talked about it and he doesn't mind trying it out here. I came to tell you, but when I arrived and found out about all this wedding stuff... and that you're leaving Valencia... and since you're mad at me. How can I be mad at you, honey? - A little. - What are you talking about? I didn't want to tell you because I was embarrassed. And I didn't want to let you down. Look, Mum, I know that... you would've liked me... to be something else... - My girl... - and not drop out of Uni, but, Mum, I realized that... I realized that I'm not an artist. OI " 8|"! Entrepreneur. I'm just... a coward. How could you be a coward, honey? You're a woman who's been able to raise a family outside of her country. You're very strong and very brave, honey. I've been very tough, very unfair on you. And you have the right to do what you want with your life. I'm so sorry, sweetie. So sorry. Hey! I don't believe it. You're not leaving, are you? I don't know what to do, I don't. I just don't get it, Violeta. I don't get it at all. A|| this Dad stuff, okay. But this wedding stuff, I'm wondering if she's doing it in order to keep the workshop. Armando, how can you be so mean? Besides, we can't desert her now, with the fuss we've caused. She caused it with this marriage stuff. I should've been with Marga this weekend, trying... to fix my marriage, which is falling apart. Armando, please. It's important that we stay, really. Everyone's got problems. I just got fired without severance. You got fired? From your job? Fuck. I'm sorry. What happened? Why? Never mind. They wanted to fire people and it fell on me. Right. Violeta, maybe... you could drink a little less. How do you know it was about that? Well, I can imagine. I drink a little, yes. It cheers me up and relaxes me. Sure. But I don't have an alcohol problem. No, no. And I don't with food. You can't see a thing here. Knock! There she is. Is the hen's night here or what? Oh, my sexy niece! Here we go! I saw this in Brazil. You have to do this with boring old John. Where's Armando? Little brother... - This is a party! - Yes, I know, I know. What happened to you and Marga? I don't know. I've spent ten years... pushing, working hard to... take the pressure off and... to have a little time to ourselves... later on, but... Later on, when? I've lost her. Marga doesn't want to come back. You two will sort it out. The thing is... I get the feeling I've done everything wrong. I did the school all wrong, my marriage, taking care of Dad... I've done all wrong. Not all... Look at the T-shirts. They're beautiful. Really! - You're so silly! - Oh, my cute brother! - Good morning, honey. - Morning. How did you sleep? Good. Where's Lidia? Upstairs, she'll be right down. She's getting the kids ready. She's not going back to Manchester, she's staying in Valencia. Why is that? It didn't go well for her. And now she needs a home, I need a salary to be able to help her. - So I'm going back to Valencia with her. - What about your plans? They'll have to wait. Do I leave her hanging? At least until John comes. But what about the workshop? Didn't you want to open it? I don't want to be in debt now. And the wedding? The advantage of a solo wedding is that I can stand myself up. And your commitment? I can't promise something I can finish. - You tell Armando, okay? - No. Yes. We'll have lunch together. I'll buy you a round at least. Wait, we'll talk it over. You're making a mistake. Thanks a lot for helping me, listening and understanding. You tell him, please, okay? What a mess! Off we go to the wedding. May God smile upon it. - I'm so nervous. - Relax, Armando, there is no wedding. What? Lidia didn't do so well in Manchester and she's coming back. And Rosa's going with her. She says the Wedding's off. Just what we needed: Dad. Dad! It's terrific here! What? How could you call the whole family in Pamplona? Auntie Conchita? But wasn't she dead? Listen, Dad, please. Don't invite anyone else, okay? I know it's Rosa's wedding, but... she wanted it to be discreet. Look, when you get here, go to the Town Hall, we're on our way there. Alright. Jeez! Mum! - What are you doing? - We're going to Valencia. We'll go to Grandad's, he'll be very happy, - then find a place for the four of us. - No, Mum. - Yes. - Mum, no. - Say something to her. - Alright, Rosa... I'm sorry how I handled this workshop thing, and without your permission. I understand that you want to advance your projects and I'll find a solution for my thing. Don't worry. What are you saying? It's not that. I'm sorry, it's not. - Oh, no? - No. Alright... What's wrong with this family, don't we listen to each other? - We don't? - No, no, we don't. We go our own way, but don't know what's going on with the person next to us. Forgive me for interrupting this great family therapy moment, but we have to make... - decisions about Rosa's wedding. - What decisions? Well... Right now... Rosa... right now at the Town Hall the councilor is waiting, half the town - and the municipal band. - What? - Well... - The band? - Municipal. - What band? Well, not the whole band, a smaller version, just 17, but... everyone's waiting. A lot of people are waiting for you. And in 10 minutes Dad's arriving with cousins, aunts and uncles... and... - the Pamplona family too. - What are you saying? Dad called everyone, Rosa. You're getting married. And you haven't told them it's a solo wedding? Well... last night I... I didn't dare, to be honest. Fuck, I told you! I wanted it to be intimate! Alright, alright... Don't you worry. I'll go there now and talk to the people, apologize in the name of the family. And we'll have the banquet. What banquet? The banquet, the banquet I organized it at the hotel. Will you stop organizing things no one asked you to? Hey, if I organize it, I think it's for the best. - The best for what? For whom! - Alright... one second. Mum, listen to me, look at me. I'll go and tell the people it was a misunderstanding. No, Fuck it! Really, eh? I'm... going to have a stroke. - Armando, congratulations! - Thank you, thank you. Holy Mary! Armando, how are you? Congratulations! - Excuse me, excuse me. - Excuse me. The Pamplona family. - Grandad... - Lidia... - Hi, Dad. What's up? - Lass, how are you? Good. I so wanted to see you. Look at them. They're beautiful. Where's Rosa? What's with your mother marrying all of a sudden without telling anyone? Did you know? Since when? Why don't you find her? See if she's ready. Get her here as soon as possible. - Dad, we'll be better off upstairs. - Let's wait for Rosa. - Help me with the babies. - See you soon. Lidia. Hi. I didn't know you were here. What's going on? - It's the wedding. - What wedding? My mother's, Rafa. I'm going. See you soon. - What's Rosa's rush to get married? - No idea. I'm worried. Is she sure about it? She hasn't known this guy long. Do you know this Rafa? - No. - You see? I didn't sleep a wink all night... I couldn't sleep either, Dad. Today's going to be... a big surprise. But, relax, it's fine. Rafa won't be a problem, I assure you. Sit down there, Dad. You'll see. I'll leave you the kids for a moment. What are you going to tell them? That it was a mistake, that I'm sorry. You have to carry on, Rosa. With the wedding, your plans, with everything. Don't you realize that history is repeating itself? First Mum, putting her dreams aside to have us. Then you did the same, for Lidia. No way, Rosa. Please, don't give up this time. She's got her partner. She has Dad, he'll be delighted to help her. And she has me. She can move in with me. I'm a mess, it'll do me good. What your daughter needs from you is to love her the way she is. Didn't you want to make a commitment today? Didn't you want a new path? - Yes. - This is the time, Rosa. In front of everyone you care about. Yes, plus some more, but we're here. I can't. Make a commitment... and keep it. If you don't do it today, you never will. I can't. Here she comes, here she comes! - It's Rosa. - But she's not dressed! - Is it her? - Yes, it's Rosa. You kept it quiet! I'm so sorry that I made you come here, this isn't what you expected. I'm so sorry. Come. Come here. Get married. - Please. - I can't. Mum, I'm begging you, please. Marry... and stay here. And you? What about you? There's been a mistake. The wedding is on the beach. I'd love you to come with me. - It's on the beach. Let's go. - Wait, Rosa. - Rafa, to the cove. - Stop for a second, Rosa. Sorry... Make way, damn it! C'mon, it's at the cove! Let's go! Let's. Yes, the cove! Everyone to the cove! Rosa! Rosa, stop for a second. Girl! Why did you make me come? To humiliate me? Laugh at me? No, because it's important to me that you're here today. Important, why? So I can see you marry another guy? - I'm not marrying another guy. - Then what the fuck are you doing? Honey, it's important to me that you're here, that you see me and listen to me. Please, to the cove. - But... - Please, Rafa, stick around. To the beach, honey! Quiet, here she comes! Here she is! Here she is! - Cutie! - Cutie! To the bride! To the bride! - To the bride! - Cutie! Beautiful! - Where's the groom? - This is all so weird. Oh. Honey! - Dad... - And this dress? But is there a wedding after all, or not? If there's no groom, there's no wedding. Thank you all so much for being here, thank you so much for coming. Today's a very special day for me. It's a day I'd like to remember for the rest of my life. Today I'm getting married. Because I've decided to commit myself to myself. Because to be treated with respect and love, you first have to respect and love yourself. And that is what I want to vow here in front of all of you. I can't believe it. "| vow to respect myself," to take care of myself. I vow to listen to myself. I vow to forgive myself. I vow to do what's best for me. I vow to ask myself first before I ask what others want. I vow to fulfill my dreams... and my desires. I vow to love myself with all my heart all the days of my life. I also want to give up... putting my happiness in the hands of others. And, finally... "I give up being obedient." To the bride! - Hurrah! - Hurrah! To the bride! - She is now married. - I don't get it at all. - I don't understand. - Is there a banquet or not? I'm sure there is. I've never seen anything like it. Rosa, that was beautiful! This is embarrassing! What a load of crap! We travelled all night. A|| the way from Pamplona for this. - This is unbearable, let's go. - Let's go. - Antonio, you and I will talk. - What did she say? I didn't hear. - It's better you didn't hear it. - Wait, Pilar. - This family's a bit... - I'm knocked out. You and me, Rosa...? Are we getting back together? Of course. Dad, this is Rafa, my boyfriend. - This is Rafa. - Hi. Nice to meet you. But... Hey... Thanks for coming, Dad. I don't get it, girl. You married without a groom? - Yes. - But how...? Are you alright? Better than ever, Dad. I want to tell you something important. - Go ahead. - You can't move in with me. Do you understand? - Right. - I'm staying here to live. I'm really going to miss you, but I'll come to see you, you'll come to see me... Of course. You have to live your own life... - and I have to live mine. - Oh, Dad... I have to do this. What did you think? There'd be fireworks? - Kiss! - Hooray! Hooray for Rosa! This is your doing, Armando. - Come on, Rosa! - Come here. To the bride! Hooray! Hooray! Come on, let's go! - God bless your Momma! - To the bride! That's it, Rosa, dance! Go! Whose idea was the band? It's great. Come on, go! Let's all dance! Come on, Marga!
