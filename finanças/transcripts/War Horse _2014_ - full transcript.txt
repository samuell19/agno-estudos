When I started working at the National Theatre in 2004 I knew that I wanted Handspring Puppets to work here And so we were reading various stories to try and work out what might be another show Tom Morris Co-Director It was War Horse, it was an extraordinary story I immediately thought: Handspring Puppet Com an Cape Town, South Africa When I started working at the National Theatre in 2004 I knew that I wanted Handspring Puppets to work here And so we were reading various stories to try and work out what might be another show And my mum said to me, 'Have you read the one... It was War Horse, it was an extraordinary story I immediately thought: ...could create that definitive puppet that is going to play a leading role The first workshop we came to was when the project was still very much a question mark There were difficulties in adapting a novel about the war to the stage out of shredded newspaper and cardboard The workshop participants were released onto the completely bare Olivier stage one afternoon And pranced around, and from up on the gallery the stage looked absolutely ideal It's of a brisk young ploughboy, He was ploughing on the plaln It was down in yonder shade, he went whistling to plough, And by chance there he met a pretty maid and breath with the object Very often you're working as a team The only way that you can really communicate with other people who are operating together with you on the same object is through breath And we were always told by the Directors Tom and Marianne , that the horses need to be horses, they're not supposed to be well behaved They must always remain animals, and animals are unpredictable Throughout the period of the First World War there was a huge amount of technology Production process was being radicalised making armaments and stuffing them into the front lines and trenches ...like the Futurists, who saw the possibility of war... ...as cleansing the dusty old dry orders When it came to Britain we had the Vorticists Basically I realised that the Vorticist and Expressionist paintings of people like Nash The fragmented and fractured environments... ...and strangely surreal and inhuman landscapes that they painted... seemed to represent more the individual soldiers' experience of being in the war Here we have the beginning of the idea of the torn paper out of the sketch book... which young Albert tak es to war with him These are Nicholls' initial drawings of July 1914 of rural Devon Little sketches of the townscape and close ups, the kind of thing he'd be working or thinking through The influence of Muybridge in his thinking, as he's drawing Joey and Albert galloping across the Downs And then the more haunting, foreboding atmosphere of the night time crossing when he's in a troopship going over to France This is the harbour itself And I was drawing with Basil, Adrian and Tom, going 'shall we do it like this? ' And I just ripped up my sketch book and put it in the theatre model box And there was a lovely cloud, or a landscape or a gash So Rae creat ed this idea of projection, and in the sky there's a ripped piece of paper that we project on to all evening With War Horse we're trying to achieve two very distinct looks for the audience We're trying to make sure they're very aware... ...of two very distinct ideas and places The most concrete place, the place where the play starts, is Devon For me, as far as the lighting goes, it's all about very, very high angles of light, warm, beautiful sunlight The kind of thing that makes you think about long summer days and being in Devon, and the landscape and space What happens then is we go from rural Devon to the hell that was the First World War When you go into the war zone, as it were suddenly the lighting is all coming at you from much, much lower more dynamic angles We used the space underneath the screen and the light comes from there Bonjour, mes amis! Spring is in the air Shame you're not on your holidays Nice is very nice this time of year, I'm told But you're not headed there, and neither am I, more's the pity Platoon, fall in Oi, your Name?
