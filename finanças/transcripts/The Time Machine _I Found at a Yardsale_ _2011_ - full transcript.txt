Excuse me? What is this? The stuff that dreams are made of. It looks like it's made of gold. It is. Whoa, it must be worth a fortune! It is. But not because it's made of gold. Why are you selling that at a yard sale? It's only for sale to the person who's supposed to have it. Yes somebody with a lot of money! No, you are the person. I don't have a lot of money. I'll settle for the $17 in your wallet. How did you know I have $17? I know a lot of things, just as you will. Why would yoyu sell a gold box for $17? Let me tell you something. There isn't enough money in the whole world to buy happiness. I'm selling it to you because you're the one that's supposed to have it. I don't understand. You will. Let me get a sturdy bag for you to carry it in. You wouldn't want to drop it. Take good care of it. No one who owns it really possesses it. They're merely the caretaker. Use it only for good. Be careful. I will. What the? [electronic noises] [electronic noises] He's right, there's not enough money in the world to buy this thing. [electronic noises] [electronic noises] I soon found that I can move forward or backward in time as fast as I wanted. I could even stop time from my perspective. I found that it was also possible to enter a time value and the machine would move you instantly to the time selected. Up to this point I'd been using the time machine as if it were a toy. I had always wondered what the future held for mankind. I decided that I wanted to see what life would be like tens of thousands of years from now. So I decided to go back to my apartment and pick up the things I thought I would need for my journey into the future. I decided to leave from Hollywood Boulevard. [electronic noises] What's that sound? The alarm. What alarm? Did you go near the monitor? The column this tall? Yeah Oh no. Now they'll find both of us. I'll be punished again. Who is "they?" Who is after us? The law enforcers. Listen to me. I have the power to prevent them from ever taking you back. Who are you? My name's Robert. What's your name? She-Ba. She-Ba? She-Ba. She-BA. Yes. Where did you come from? I'm from here, actually. I've never seen you. And your clothes are so strange. I came from the past. Traveled here through time. How did you travel through time? I have a machine. A time machine that I use to travel through time. Where is your time machine? It's in my backpack. Can two people travel through time? Yep. Why are they after you? I'm a runaway. Why did you run away? To escape. I'm sorry. I didn't know. How long? Long. What about your family? I have no family. No one? No. Where are you gonna go? Where were you running to? I don't know. Anywhere but here. Have other people escaped? Some. Where did they go? I don't know. Never saw them again. Robert? Yeah? Why did you come here? I wanted to see what would happen to the human race. Now you've seen. Yeah. Now you're going to return to your time? Not yet. I still want to go farther in the future and see what happens. Robert, can you take me with you? Are you sure that's what you want? Yes. Alright. [electronic noises] Stand close to me. How far did we go into the future? I'm not sure. Thousands of years? At least they can't follow us here. They sure can't do that. Cause I'm not a slave anymore, I'm not gonna look like one. I'll be right back. I kept it a secret. I hid it until the day I would be free. I made it myself. It's very nice. Thanks. I'll keep this for money. What do the women in your time wear? They wear all kinds of things. Some of them wear dresses like the one you're wearing. Do you have a wife? No. Do you have a woman you care about? Not at the moment. Do you have a mother and a father? A brother and a sister? I have a mother and sister. Do you live with them? No we have own places. I'd like to meet them. Do you think they'll like me? Yeah I think they would. I hope so. Where will I live? My mom's gonna be away for a couple months. You can stay at her place till we figure out what to do. Where you come from, what do you do? You mean for work, what do I do? Yes, what do you do for work? It's kind of hard to explain. I work for an online publication on the Internet. Oh boy. It's a way of telling people about things. So everyone knows you're going into the future? No, no one knows. No one even knows I have a time machine. Oh, what about work? What'd you tell the people where you work? I'm on vacation. What does that mean? Every year I get three weeks where I don't have to work. I had one day a week. I have two days a week, plus three weeks. Oh. That's nice. I bet you like vacation better than work. Yeah. Me too. You know, I can use the time machine to make my vacation as long as it want. I can set the machine to go back to the exact day I left. Even the hour, the exact minute. I can make my vacation last 20 years if I wanted to, and no one would even know I was gone. Wouldn't they ask what happened if you come back and look 20 years older? Yeah. Let's climb that hill. And see if we can see any signs of civilization. It's a spaceship. Come on, I gotta see this. It didn't crash. Looks like it's been here for some time. They must have just walked away from it and never came back. Who does it belong to? Us. Let's go inside and have a look. Looks like the crew's quarters. They didn't make their beds. They must have left in a hurry. Look there's a hallway up ahead. Where does it go? I'm not sure. We have to come back later and check it out. What are those? Some kind of cargo containers strapped to the floor. Looks like it's the control room of the ship. This is cool. Maybe we shouldn't be here. Why not? Whoever owned it abandoned it. It's ours now. Let's have a look we'll see if it's still functioning. This is nice. Very comfortable. Why don't we see how to turn it on? Why don't you give me the time machine? I'll wait outside. Relax. Why don't you sit down. You've never flown something like this have you? Stop worrying. What could go wrong? I don't like this. Sit down please. Yes! That's more like it. Put your seatbelt on. My what? Your seatbelt. Here. Over your shoulder. All right! Ramp up! Whoops! I told you! Yoooooo! If you travel a space how will you find your way back? That doesn't look like it's gonna be a problem. This screen is part of some inertial tracking system. Always shows you where you are relative to where you started. I can always find my way back. What's this? We must deliver the supplies to the members of the Resistance as soon as responsible. See Mr. Aggasiz at the outpost on Damar. He will tell you exactly where to deliver the shipment. Mr. Seven, you were very highly recommended. The lives of many people are in your hands. He must be talking about those boxes we saw. Yes, Mr. Seven must have been taking them to the Resistance people and something happened to him. How will we know where Damar is? So that's what this, is it's a course set to Damar. Look the last point here says "Damar." If people need a supply thing you just take them there. We don't know we're getting into. It could be dangerous. We need to go. Okay. What are these points? What's this called? I don't know. Well it's on the way. We could stop there and see. All right. Well, we're on our way. Yikes this thing's fast. Even at sublight speed. There's Saturn, the planet with the rings? I wonder what it's like to go between the planet and its rings. Hang on. Wow that was fun. Yeah that was fun. Ok, I gotta get us back on course. Let's see how to go to warp speed. I got it. Wow look at this. This is fantastic. Yes. We're traveling at warp seven. What's that? Seven times the speed of light. Very fast. Look! Let me fly it now. I've watched you. I can fly it. All right, it's all yours. This is really fun. It sure is. It's great having your own spaceship. Yes. Well it's not far to the pole so you can fly it there. When we get there, I think you better let me land it. All right. I'm gonna get a little rest. Tell me when we get there. Okay. Robert? Uh-huh? I think we're almost there. Okay let me take it now. Alright. Okay dropping to sublight now. Should be a planet right around that star. There it is dead ahead. According to the planet map, we're close to the place marked on the map. Should be at the foot of the mountain. Shall we go have a look? Yes. Oh how beautiful. Yeah. If it doesn't take long will you just stop at this other planet says says "D?" I don't care, that's fine. I wonder what D means. I don't know. It looks like it's the fourth planet from the Sun. Maybe that's why it's called D. I don't know, maybe. Well if it's anything like the coolest planet. How beautiful. It sure is. I gotta go get my backpack. Don't walk too far away. I'll be back in a minute. I won't go far. I'm so frightened. Nw we know what the D stands for. This is where they said he is. Well, after you. Please, let me get you a table. We're here to see Mr. Agassiz. Oh, business! In that case, you'll be our guests. Please, follow me. Please have a seat. The show is about to start. I'll get you something to drink. Nothing too strong. Of course, please make yourselves comfortable. I'll be back in a minute. Mr. Agassiz will be here shortly. Thank you. It's a nice place. Yes. Not bad. Yes, it was good. I'm Agassiz, how can I help you? I'm Robert Moore. This is She-Ba. Pleased to meet you. We're here to get the instructions on where to deliver the shipment for Mr. Seven. ~Where is Seven? We don't know. He disappeared. We found this ship where he left it. We were told to see you for instructions on where to deliver the supplies to the Resistance. It would be best if you didn't mention that word. The Empire has its spies everywhere. You must not discuss this with anyone else. I hope that nothing has happened to Seven. It's not like him to walk away and just leave his ship. The ship's ramp had dust on it. It looked like it'd been there for some weeks. That's disturbing. This paper has the information you'll need to deliver the supplies. Thanks. We'll deliver the shipment. These are dangerous times. We're not from around here. We don't know anything that's going on. In the last few years, the Empire's government has changed. Some very bad people have seized power. Things have become very repressive. Many have been imprisoned, or just disappeared. Do you have in your possession something that you would like to sell? Like what? It's not important, I just thought. What kind of thing? You didn't happen find any diamonds have you? We don't have any diamonds. It's not important. But if you should happen to find yourself in possession of certain stones, I can offer you the best price for them. Just keep in mind.. We will. Yes. I wish you good fortune. May you be guided and protected, maybe meet again very soon. Thank you. Thank you. We're getting near the place Mr. Agassiz warned us about, aren't we? Yeah. It's probably too late to turn back now. Yeah I think so. What is it? I don't know. I can't tell. I think there's something ahead. I'm gonna drop to sublight and see what's going on. Sublight now! We can't outrun them. I'm gonna drop to sublight speed and find a place to hide. There! There's a planet. I'm gonna go around it and hide the ship. It's no good. They're on our tail. We got to move. I've got an idea. I noticed before, when we went through a nebula our instruments went dead, and we couldn't see anything. We're coming up on one now. I'm gonna slip in there, and come to a stop. Hopefully they won't be able to find us. Here we go. I think we're drifting. That's okay. Maybe we lost them. No, I can sense they're very near. Let me handle the ship. I can find them. How? You can't see them. I sense them. I can do it. Okay. But you'll have to use thrusters only. Yeah! You did it! Well you've got the helm, why don't you lay in our course. We're almost to the planet. I hope there's someone there to receive the supplies. I hope so too. We've already had a shootout with one star cruiser. Who knows how many are looking for us now. I don't think they're too happy about what happened. We need to drop off the supplies and get the hell out of here. Do you want to land the ship? You can land it. You're the ace here. I haven't destroyed any enemy ships. Oh, cheer up. Maybe you'll get your chance. No let's hope not. Well that's that. I wonder why no one was here to meet us. I dunno. Seven was supposed to deliver the stuff some week ago. I guess they couldn't just stay around. It's too dangerous. Well we did what we were supposed to. Mr. Agassiz's instructions say to bury the supplies under the marker if no one was here. Yeah we did it. I just need to rest. We'll go in a minute. We'll go when you're ready. I wish I knew more about what's going on here. Here we are, in a strange place, far from Earth, thousands of years beyond my time or yours. Do you wish you were back on Earth? No, my life's much more interesting now. Just to think that only a few days ago, I spent my time sitting behind a desk, writing about things that just don't seem very important now. A few days ago seems like a hundred years. I know what you mean. My life is so much better now. I could never go back to my time. You don't realize what you're missing until you've had a taste of freedom. I'll never go back. Don't worry about it, you're not going back. It seems like everything that's happened was supposed to happen. Of course. What I mean is, from the beginning - The old man that gave me the time machine, and stopping where I did in your time. If I had been a few minutes earlier or a few minutes later, we never would have met. It was all meant to be. I don't believe in coincidences. Whatever happens is supposed to happen. Seems like it. And there's the whole thing with the ship. It was just sitting there waiting for us. And the message from Mr. Seven? Yeah that's what I'm talking about. It seems like everything was just sitting there waiting for us. It was supposed to be. Yeah well, what now? What do you want to do? Well we have the ship and lots of food. I'd like to to see more places that I haven't been to. You'd like to travel? Yes. I guess that would be fun. While we're at it, maybe we could become a little more knowledgeable about what's going on this time. It might make it a little safer. One thing's for sure, we need to get far away from here. Back maybe closer to Damar. Okay that's a good place to start. All right are you ready to go? If you think you're feeling alright. I'm okay, I just need to rest for a little bit. Let's go. Okay. Oh I forgot! While you were digging, I was cleaning the ship, and I found this. Oh man, oh! The more I find out about Mr. Seven, the more I think he was into a lot of things. Diamond smuggling, who knows what? Could we use some of them to buy some things? What sort of things? Since we're going back to Damar, I thought maybe we could buy some new clothes. You want to buy new clothes? I saw some beautiful clothes there. Why not? They're yours, and you found them. I think one of those stones could buy you more clothes than you could fit in the ship. I see you found something. I found a few things. Did you see Mr. Agassiz? Yeah, he said again that he'd be glad to buy any diamonds that we'd like to sell. I don't think we'll need any more money for a long time. No, I think we're set for a while. He's got a new job for us. Does it involve the Resistance? No, he says it's not dangerous. Said he'd do it himself if he had a ship. What is it? We have to go pick something up on another planet, and bring it back here. It's not anywhere near where those star cruisers were, is it? No, it's not anywhere near there. He said he'd pay us ten thousand credits to do it. It's up to you. We can go if you want to. I mean if it's not too dangerous, and it's not too far, I think we should. Ten thousand credits is a lot of money. Why would he pay so much? I don't know. I mean, renting a ship's not cheap. Maybe he thinks we're trustworthy. Maybe it's very valuable, and he doesn't trust anyone else to do it. Yeah I'm sure that's part of it. Ready to go? Yes. Okay, I entered the coordinates. We shouldn't have any problem locating the planet. I wanna do the takeoff. I don't care. Just be careful around all the buildings, and watch out for other ships. I will. I'm getting kind of hungry. Do you think you can go to the galley, make us a couple sandwiches, bring back some drinks? Please? All right, just don't do any fancy maneuvers. I'll put it on autopilot. Mmm, it's delicious. Thanks. You're welcome. It's like having a motorhome, only it can travel through space at the speed of light, or faster. I need to put cupholders in this thing. Okay, I'll set the ship down at the coordinates. Should be right about there. Oh, look at the mountain. Yeah. Setting it down now. It's supposed to be a short distance from here. Shall we go? Yeah. I'm a little chilly, but not too cold. It's not cold, it's nice. Where we're supposed to go is over there. Let's go. Well, it was right where Agassiz he said it'd be. How'd he know it was here? I don't know. Someone must have dropped it off here. Why here, I don't know. It doesn't look like it's been here long. From what he said, I got the impression that it was dropped off here in the last few days. It's much colder here. We need to get back to the ship. We're not dressed for this. What was that? I don't know, let's get back to the ship. Oh my god. No. I thought there weren't supposed to be any Imperial ships around here. That's what he said. Well, it was fun while it lasted. We're gonna die, aren't we? Sun's gonna go down in two hours, and when it does we're gonna freeze to death. I've had a lot of fun. I don't regret anything. Me neither, I just wish it would have lasted a little longer. Do you think it will hurt? No, they say that you just all asleep and don't wake up. I wish I gotten to meet your mother and sister. I wanted to make a good impression. They would've liked you, I'm sure. I could use some coal. Yeah. Robert? What? Please, please. What? Robert, is the time machine in your backpack? I dunno. I can't remember. Yeah, yeah. We can leave and go back in time before they find the ship. Yeah, we're gonna be okay. I'm a little nervous. Everything's gonna be fine. Smile. Hi mom. Hi. I'm Robert's mom. Call me Patty. It's so nice to meet you, She-Ba. I'm Barb. This is so much like Robert to do something like this and not tell us. We are so happy for the both of you. C'mon, lets not stand out here, let's go inside. So where did you meet? In Hollywood. I was walking and- We bumped into each other. Yeah. I took a few steps back, and we actually crashed right into each other. That's funny. So are you from Los Angeles? Yes I've always lived here. Yeah she actually grew up right here in Hollywood. And your parents do they live in Southern California? They did, but they died when I was very young. I'm sorry So how long have you guys known each other? I guess about a week. Really? So it was love at first sight? It all happened so fast. Yes, it certainly did. Well I think it's wonderful that the two of you wanted to tie the knot. So, She-Ba, what do you do? She works at a produce company, selling berries and stuff. But she quit her job when we both met. So he sweeped you off your feet and carried you away? Yeah sort of. It's mutual. I quit my job this morning. But I thought you liked your job? I did, but well, between the two of us, we have a bit of money. We're gonna travel. Yeah, she's always wanted to travel, so we're gonna see a bunch of places she's never seen. You'll have lots of adventures together. Definitely. I bought a motorhome, so we're gonna travel around in that. One of those big monsters? Oh yes it looks like a ship. So you're gonna take a couple years off and see the sights? Yeah. There's something to be said for doing things when you're young enough to really enjoy it. Are you ready to go? I just found this. This is a treasure map. You want to go on a treasure hunt? Yes. Alright, let's go. I think I figured out what part of the star system this map refers to. Should be at this planet any minute. I think we're right about here on the map. We need to get through this canyon. Looks kind of narrow. I think we're gonna have to walk and leave the ship behind. Ready to go? Okay. Well this is the first point on the map. Go around the dragon's head, and keep walking. It shows the holes in the rock. We keep going. Well this is the third point, crack in the rock. We got to keep going. There's the entrance to the canyon. Let's go. Wow, this is a weird-looking place. Yes, it's spooky. We're almost there. I think we go around one more bend. Least that's what the map says. I think I see the end. This must be the entrance to the cave. Yeah. Are you ready? Yes. Look, there's a hole in the top of the cave. Yeah. Whoah, I can't see the bottom of this thing. Must be hundreds of feet deep. Let's get away from the edge. Well, according to the map I gotta go down here. Stay here, I'll be right back. Oh man, I... Look, from down there. More diamonds? Yeah. There must be a hundred of these bags down there. I'm gonna go get more. Stay here. Okay. Wow, this is great. I don't see how it could get any better than this. Yeah, it's wonderful. Would you like more fish? Oh no thanks, I couldn't eat anymore. It was good though. Yeah I'm full too. Want a refill? No, I'm fine. Robert? What? We need to talk about it. We just got here, we deserve more than a few days' rest. I know, we need a little rest. But at some point we need to help the Resistance. If you don't want to, we won't. I didn't say I didn't want to help them. I just think we need a rest. That's fine, I won't say anything else about it. I want to help them. I told Agassiz we would. It's just a question of when. All right, we'll flip a coin. Head, we leave now. Tails, we leave in a week. Alright. Oh, man.
