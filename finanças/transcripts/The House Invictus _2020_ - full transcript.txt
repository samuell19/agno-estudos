[Music] I confess. I confess to almighty God. To blessed Mary ever Virgin. To blessed Michael the archangel. To Blessed John the Baptist. To the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul. And to all the Saints. I have sinned exceedingly, through thoughts, words, and deeds. Through my faults. Through my faults. Through my most grievous faults. Therefore I beseech blessed Mary, ever-virgin. Blessed Michael the archangel Blessed John the baptist And to the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul and all the saints. To pray for me to the Lord our God. Amen. Amen. In honor of the Father, the son and the holy spirit. [Music] And if it doesn't look proper for a person who is yellow or Chinese to be walking around the Murphy or Jones or Johnson or Bunch or Powell, I think it would be just as improper for a black person or the so-called Negro in this country as we're thought by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad to walk around with these names and therefore he teaches us that during slavery the same slave master who owned us put his last name on us to denote that we were his property. So when you see a Negro today who's named Johnson, if you go back in his history you'll find that he was once his grandfather or one of his forefathers was owned by a White man who was named Johnson. If his name was Bunch, his grandfather was owned... .. I get the point ...by a white man that was named Bunch. Would you mind telling me what your father's last name was? My father didn't know his last name. My father got his last name from his grandfather and his grandfather got it from his grandfather who got it from the Slave Master The real names of our people were destroyed during slavery... [Radio shuts off] Is that you Jamie? No son, it's me I brought you some new towels. I'll be out in a second. [Shower turns off] Jay! You are no longer a little boy. Yes Daddy G. And I'd appreciate it if you knock next time. We are in the house of the lord. We ought to have a level of decency Decency? That's ripe and rich coming from you...

Jaime? ...I'm sorry. ...Jaime? I'm so stupid.. stupid.. stupid JAIME! What's the matter with you? Okay, this... this whole thing is new to me. And you'll be fine. If only I was half the leader you are. Don't ever let me hear you call yourself stupid again. Yes... Yes. [clears throat] The presentation tonight for the new candidates... It's got my head all wrapped up. And you'll be fine. What is it? ...Nothing it's... it's... No, first it's nothing and then it turns into something. What is it Jaime? You need to spit it out. ...He's terrifying Who? You know... You'll learn to love him. Is there anything else? I can't quite remember and I should because we've been studying this for so long. How many Hail Mary's should I do around the rosary again? Like, I tried to pray tonight and... I forgot. ...and I didn't even know to ask Pete because you know he would have just looked at me. Jaime. because you know he would have just looked at me. and think that I was crazy and laugh. Jaime. and think that I was crazy and laugh. ...and everybody's always laughing and I don't feel like myself anymore. JAMIE! ...and everybody's always laughing and I don't feel like myself anymore. You're nervous, have a drink. No.... I couldn't. I couldn't We are not supposed to indulge in the pleasures of the bottle. Says who? It's ungodly. Believe me you, he's not watching. Drink it. Jamie, drink it. [Coughing] Better? No Another And you'll feel better Drink... Now? Much better. Good. As you were. I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.

But you're right where you need to be. There's only one rule to surviving The House Invictus. Get the bear. Don't let the bear get you. [Door shuts] They're here. How many? Ten. The newspaper? Yes? Anything interesting? No, a little government, politics... Things of that nature. Nothing that concerns any of you. Good to meet all of you. My name is Jay. President of The House Invictus. To my right is Pete, Vice President and to my left is Jaime, Chair of Events. ... And That's Daddy G the old butler. Now, we are very happy to have you this evening. Let's take a walk. Now this house was built in 1619. Brick-by-brick, young men just like yourself. Agile, able, strong with their bare hand. It holds the power of history and it has a very peculiar sense of knowing everything about everyone who walks inside of it. If you are selected you must continue this legacy of tradition. Tradition is important, but what's more important than tradition, is property. This property sits on on an acreage of about a thousand. We hope it's not too intimidating. In the summers we host golf and garden parties but the winters, obviously not much happens Follow me. Now this next part of the house is my personal favorite. It's where all the real magic happens. Please come in, gentlemen. Now you see our founding fathers created a unique organization of excellent and supremely talented black men like yourselves. If you would like to know more information about all ten of them, you can find it here in this manual. Pete? Jamie. Please take one gentleman and pass it to the next. Now if you refer to the back of your books what you'll find is history and that's exactly what you all are here tonight to do. Create history for yourselves and your family by presumably joining this house. Now we would like to get to know every last one of you so Daddy G will serve tea in the main living room, followed by dinner. You will have time to freshen up and have a change of clothes. Are there any questions? When will we find out if we make it? Yeah we all really want to know.... We're dying to know. You'll find out by the end of the night. Are there any more questions? Good.... [Music Plays] [Chatter] This is it fellas. Look at all this.... So this is how the other one percent is living. Right. The good life! The Invictus life! ...

There's no need for that. I'm just saying. You just sit there and don't you worry your pretty little face about a thing. You are making our brothers feel uncomfortable. Brothers....

I don't know.. Is it young Theodore over here? Who is it? I don't know!! Okay... I don't know... I don't know. You're all fucking weak, like little pups, squirming at the breast of your dying mother. This gravy is fucking delicious. Don't you think it's fucking delicious Tommy? You don't like gravy Mr. Jenkins? No? Oh, c'mon Tommy! [Laughter] C'mon guys. The gravy can't be that bad. Eat up! There's a storm coming. You're going to need all of your strength. [Music intensifies] Barrington. Barrington... Barrington... Barrington! Yes, father Yes... Two words you wish you could have spoken but you couldn't because he wasn't there. Papa wasn't there. He left you and your poor black mother for a white woman. And you forgotten, yet you craved for his affection. So badly you desired his love. A man who wanted nothing to do with you. But, i'm here... I can make you feel... good. Every fiber of your soul, every inch of your body, from your shoulders to your arms, to your back Straight... Broad... And your hands... The hands that killed Matthias. That make you feel good? His face... Broken. Beaten to a pulp! That make you feel like a man, Barrington? You think that's power? You mistake power for violence. Violence is recklessness. But power is control! You see, I am a man Barry. I am a real... A real man. I understand control. I understand the resilience it takes to deal with... Years and years... the will to overcome recklesness. You are a boy!!! You're a boy that never knew his father. That's not power Barry. That's confusion. But I can make you feel... good. You're lost. [Loud cries] [Music] [Muffled cries] [Music] [Muffled cries] [Raindrops] Yes, I know everyone is sad because of what happened tonight. But there's no need for all of that sad shit. Mathias is with the Lord now. He's in a much better place. We should all be so lucky. Where is he? He'll be buried tonight. Not him. ...Barry. Any particular reason for your interest? He's one of us and he's... Disappeared. So we should know what's happened to him. You want to know? Yes... Oh you guys really want to know? Yes! Well, if you must know, Barrington is being held in solitary confinement. He's in deep penance, repenting for his sins. The majority of which you helped him commit. He didn't mean to kill him... And you know that because? You're all of a sudden God? I'm not. I just think that... Shut up! ...You're not the gatekeeper of good and bad. No, I'm not the gate keeper. I'm the fucking wolf that strikes the Shepherd and this is no longer fucking Bethlehem. So, you're calling us sheep? [Clapping] Yes, finally! Someone who's thinking with their brain. That's exactly what you are... sheep. Where I say you go, you go. I'm nobody's sheep. Oh yes you are. You came here. All of you came here to be led... And me, no stranger to kindness and my brothers... We decided to keep you. This feels good to you? This...? Hospitality, kindness, compassion... There's no compassion behind any of this. Taking in the morally corrupt and absolving them of their transgressions? Transgressions...? Oh c'mon I'm a beacon of compassion! Wouldn't you say so young Theodore? You should be more like your brother, Theodore. Speaking of transgressions, Jamaal? You know all to well about transgressions, don't you? What was her name? Sarah...? Annabelle? Annabelle.. Sarah...? Was it the two? What was her name? Sarah... It was Sarah, wasn't it? Young Sarah... You did like her, didn't you? Yes. You do you have a thing for young girls. You enjoyed watching her, didn't you? Through her window in the morning when she was getting ready. Following her to school... You enjoyed the smell of coconuts, don't you? She did like the particular perfume. A coconut scented perfume... What the fuck is this place? ...Language! Do you always ask this many questions, Mr. Daniels? Only at dinner. A sharpshooter! I'm not easily impressed, especially by your kind. You care for a proposition? My kind? You care for a proposition? No! Here, I'll tell you anyway. You ask one more question and I'll kill you. Or you ask no more questions and you allow us to enjoy this nice meal and i'll think about maybe keeping alive until the next round. How does that sound? [Door opens] Up... Up! Greetings Big Brother. [Clears throat] Greetings Big Brother! I'm so sorry we tried to wait for you Big Brother. We really did. I promise... It's quite all right Jaime. It's quite all right. The other hand brother. You're never right in the eyes of Big Brother... Remember that. [Loud thuds] This gravy is really fucking delicious! [Whistling] [Loud cries] Evening Gentlemen! How are we doing? Told you that gravy was fucking delicious, didn't I? It was lovely. My word is as good as it comes! It's like a bond. Now, earlier this evening, I had a conversation with the Lord up there. He said to me... Peter! look down on your lowly subjects and bring them into salvation. Save them he said. Now, since you Johnny are the smartest one, you're gonna help me with this! Let's go! you're gonna help me with this! you're gonna help me with this! Let's go! you're gonna help me with this! [Loud cries] Face your brothers. Look at them! Look at them... Look at them!! Lift your head up and look at them. Now, I need you to give me a name. Which one would be the first one of your brothers that you'd like to save? What is the first name of the brother that you'd like to save? [Loud cries] I... You don't know? I don't know! Look at them! You don't want to do the Lord's work? You don't want to do the Lord's work? Who will it be? Will it be Drew? Will it be Drew, perhaps? Will it be Drew?... Drew the womanizer? Or... perhaps, Theodore? Young, innocent, sweet Brother Theodore! Who will it be? Theodore! Precious, young Theodore. So shy and innocent. Brother Theodore! How are you doing tonight? You want to stay alive don't you? You want to live don't you? Yes Big Brother! You want to live? Yes! Beg! Beg him for your life! Beg him! Look at him and beg! Save me. Save him! Save me... Save me... Save me.. Save him!!! Save me!!! Save him!!! He wants to be saved. Will you save him, Johnny? Save me... Will you save him tonight? Johnny, will you save him? I don't know... You don't know? I don't know! What's there to know, its simple! You either want to save him, or you don't! Do you want to fucking save him? [Loud cries] I don't think he wants to save you. I don't think he wants you... I don't think he wants to save you!! Beg him some more. Beg him for your life! I don't want to die! He doesn't want to die Jonathan. He doesn't want to die! Will you save his life.. Please!!! Don't you have an ounce of kindness left in you? Save him! Will you save him? Who will it be? What's it going to be? Give me a name! Give me a fucking name now! Will you not save your brother? [Loud cries] What will it be? Give me a name! Give me the fucking name! Give me the fucking name! ......Ji..Jide..Jide. What was that? Jide! Jide? Jide. Jide? Oh that's an interesting turn of event isn't it Theodore? You, Theodore! Your time hasn't com yet. Get back in line. Get back in line! Get back in line! Young Jide, sir. Your time has come today! [Loud cries] it seems that the lord has found favor on you. Get up! Get up! [Loud cries] You have been chosen by Johnny to be saved. Look at that! I'll have mercy on you. I have mercy on you. The Lord has found mercy on you! I'm going to untie you. Now, today is not your day. the Lord has decided to give you another day to live, and die another day. Now, go! See over there? That's home! I need you to run towards it, and do not look back! Go! Go! Run! Run! [Music intensifies] [Gunshot] [Loud cries] Did y'all see that? What's the next name Johnny? You're sick! I'm sick? Drew!!! Your brother here seems to think I'm sick... twisted... confused... But that's not the case is it though, Drew? Is it? He's wrong. I'm not confused. I'm not sick, am I? I just want to go home... You want to go home? Yes! Why? We've just started with this game. Isn't this fun for you? No! Isn't this fun? [Loud cries] Look, do you want to be next? No! You don't want to be next? No! Home is that way. Don't you want to go home? [Loud cries] Do you... You don't want to go home? No... Good! 'cause I just started having fun with you! Johnny! Give me a name! Give me a name! What's gonna be the next name Johnny? Tell me. What's the next name? What's gonna be the next name Johnny? I don't want to kill anybody. You don't want to kill anybody? Now, let me tell you a story. Now, let me tell you what happens to disobedient boys. I once had this toy. This toy that I loved. It was this green army man with these black boots on. Now, let me tell you a story. Now, let me tell you what happens to disobedient boys. I named him Donald. I loved Donald. He was my favorite toy. Now, I really enjoyed playing with him because when I came back from school, after all the kids used to bully me... I don't know why they fucking bullied me... I don't even really know. But when I came home, he used to make me feel good. He used to make me feel happy. I don't even really know. But when I came home, he used to make me feel good. So one day, I'm on my way home from school, and I'm just thinking about Donald. All I'm thinking about is Donald... Donald... Donald! Donald is gonna make me feel better. I get home, and I see Patrick playing with him in the garden. Patrick was my brother. You see, my parents. They had this thing for the names 'P' There was me Pete, there was Patrick, there was Precious! Precious! Precious... she was my precious little sister. But this isn't about Precious! This is about Patrick! I come home, I go to the garden and I see Patrick playing with Donald. And I run over and I say: Patrick, please stop playing with him, otherwise I'm gonna have to kill you. Of course I don't mean it. I don't fucking mean it. I don't want to kill him. He's my brother. Why in the fuck would I want to kill my brother? And then I tell him: Stop playing with him. Does he listen?... No, he keeps throwing him up and down... ...and up and down. and up and down! He lands in the dirt. He's muddy. He's fucking muddy now. So I run in the kitchen. I get my mom's favorite knife. She's got this six inch long blade. And I come back in the garden and do you know what I do? I stab Patrick repeatedly... Over and over again... Over and over again! Over and over and over again... Do you not see what happens to disobedient little boys? Huh? Do you see? You don't want that, do you? No... so what I'll need from you now is a fucking name... Give me the fucking name of the person you want to save! ...Phil Phil...? Phillip! your time has come to be called upon to the Lord today... [Loud cries] now... Johnny, what's it going to be? Who's the next name brother of yours that you'd like to save? Pick wisely. Give me a name now... Choose wisely. Who will it be? Sam... Sam! Samuel! You have been chosen. May the Lord be with you now and forever more. [Gunshot] [Manic laughter] This is fucking fun! Aren't you guys having fucking fun? This is fucking amazing! Johnny, aren't you having fun? I know you guys are having fun. You're doing so well. You're nothing like Patrick at all. You're nothing like Patrick Patrick wouldn't have given me any names. Now, we just need one more name from you. You're doing really great Johnny. Now, give us the last name. Give us on more name. Who will it be? One of your brothers... Who will it be? Jamaal... Jamaal? [Laughter] You had that one locked and loaded. Didn't you? [Laughter] Come here. You ain't done yet... Now... because you've been so good, I'm gonna do you one better. [Muffled cries] Take this... Take this... Hold this. Hold it... Hold it! Feel it. Feels good, doesn't it? Hold it! Hold on to it! No!!! Shut up! Johnny, you can do this. It shouldn't be so difficult to do the Lord's work. No!!! No!!! It shouldn't be a problem at all. No! This guy plays with little girls. You have a sister, don't you Johnny? You have a sister, yea? How would you feel if you found out that this guy... That this guy Jamaal was looking at your sister through the window everyday for six months! Six Months!! [Loud cries] You wouldn't like that... would you? C'mon, you can do it. Stay steady... Look at me! Look at me Johnny. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me!!! Imagine him... watching her through the window. Following her... Sniffing her hair! What the fuck is the matter with that guy? What would you do? I'm so sorry... Johnny. Please! No..no..no..no..no [Gunshot] [Manic laughter] [Music] [Music] [Door opens] [Drink pours] You need help with that? You know comprehension wasn't one of your strong suits. What the hell is this? What do you know about this? We're gonna play this game again Peter? Game... what game? Jaime... Yes brother. Give us the room. [Clears throat] No... What? I said, I'm not leaving. Whatever you have to say to Pete ,you can say it to me. You're beginning to corrupt him. Someone has to help him. He's fucking lost. You used to be just like him... Don't forget that. Yea, you won't let me. You're so proud of yourself. What's there to be ashamed of? You relish in their anguish and you delight in their pain. I'm doing the Lord's work. There's not a single godly bone in your body Peter. Oh... and you? Me? C'mon! C'mon Jay! There's no need for this performance. I'm trying to save them. ...With your misguided science? I don't have their blood on my hands. No... not on your hands. [Clears throat] You think you're better than me. On the contrary you and me, we are cut from the same cloth brother. No... I give life, you take it away. You don't give a goddamn thing. I have given you everything you own. Everything you own I have given to you. I molded you... I created you... I give and I give and you take and you take... You don't give a goddamn thing Jay! You don't give a goddamn thing! You don't give me a goddamn thing Jay! [Music] Remember all those years ago? We were boys then... Outside on the fields looking for sticks to use as swords. And we would fight until the sun went down. Inseparable... Both of us. What happened to us? I became my own man... No... You became a monster! I became what you made me Jay. I became a reflection of you. You're nothing like me. I became exactly what you molded me to be. You look nothing like me. You're delusional... You're uneasy. You're threatened. Because I dont... Because I don't obey everything you say, like some.. Stop it! You leave him out of this. You know he doesn't deserve your loyalty. Stop it. You know he doesn't deserve your loyalty. He's nothing without you. Stop it... stop it... stop it... No, Peter. You are nothing without me... Stop it!!! [Music] How long have you been standing there? Long enough to smell your shit. [Sniffing] Back on the bottle I see... I see right through you. That makes two of us. You're emotional, you need rest. [Slurping] Your true age is starting to show. Brother Jay... No. leave him. Let him go. He's a wasted man What is the matter with your hand? Isn't there someplace you have to be? Oh... Jamie... You're my only good son. I don't understand. What don't you understand son?

[Whispers] Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit from pole to pole. I thank whatever God's may be for my unconquerable soul, in the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloodied but unbowed, beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade and yet the Menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how straight the gate. How charged with punishments the scroll.. I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. Barry...? [Loud punch] [Gunshot] You'll always be a boy... C'mon man! [Music] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Bone crack] [Background chatter] [Gunshot] [Music] [Loud thud] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Music] I gave you life and you waste it away.... [Music] I confess [Music] I confess to almighty God. To blessed Mary ever-virgin. To blessed Michael the Archangel. To Blessed John the Baptist. To the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. And to all the saints I've sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed. Through my fault, through my fault. Through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech blessed Mary ever-virgin. Blessed Michael the Archangel. Blessed John the Baptist. The the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul. And to all the saints to pray for me to the Lord our God. Amen. Amen! In honor... of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Daddy..? Yes my child? Where's Jamie? Knocking at the gates of hell He didn't make it this time. Welcome to The House Invictus. You may call me Daddy G. I don't know where you come from. I don't know what you've done. But just know that you're right where you need to be. There's only one rule to surviving The House Invictus. Get the bear... Don't let the bear get you. [Music]
