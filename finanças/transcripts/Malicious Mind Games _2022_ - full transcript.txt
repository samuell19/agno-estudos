[wondrous orchestral music] [intense ambient music] [eerie orchestral music] I hate these things. [Isabel] Hello? We're closed. [eerie orchestral music] Is someone there? [woman screaming] Rosaline? Where are you, I can't? [woman screaming] Rosaline! -[woman screaming] -Rosaline! [Megan]Ma'am, are you all right? Are you okay? You were screaming. Yeah, I guess I had a nightmare. Sometimes, I fall asleep standing. I didn't know that Cameron hired a new security guard. I live across the street, haven't seen you before. Yeah, Monday was my first day. I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell Cameron I fell asleep at work. Your secret's safe with me. So, I guess the theater's doing better? Cameron's had a rough couple years. She was in a bad car accident and one trouble led to another. Trouble? Well, like money trouble among other things, but I'm sure it's all in the past. I'm not really one of gossip. Oh, of course. Anyway, oh crap. I gotta go. My hospital shift starts in an hour. Long night? Sometimes. It's one of the perks of being single. You sure you're okay? I'm fine. All right. One more thing. You should grab a chair from Cameron's office to sit on. As long as you put it back before you leave, she won't care. Be a lot more comfortable to fall asleep on. That's a good idea. All right, new cameras are up and rolling. Call if you have any problems. Of course. Thank you. Okay, so all of my backups are right here. Much more secure. And this is our portable monitor, all right? I have to go. I'll see you later. Cameron, wait. Can you show how to work the new system before you leave? Sure, right quick. So right here, all the cameras are on the outside of the building. We have cameras on the alley, the backstage, front of the house, and theater. So you just have to click here to see each view. Go ahead. Who's that? I'm so sorry. Let me just. Excuse me? Rosaline, what are you doing? Can I borrow it? Rosaline. It's real leather. Can you imagine how cool and mysterious I'd look if I came into school with this tomorrow? I'm sure you would, honey, but this is a place of business, not your personal closet. Sorry, Cameron. You know what? Just take it. It'll look great on you. And I'm sure it'll make quite an impression, that is, if your mom says yes. Just don't touch the costume jewelry in this case. Some of them are pretty fragile, okay? Thanks for the jacket. Thank you, seriously. And thanks for the job. I think a new job and a new school would be a fresh start. When did leather jackets come back in style? Who knows with kids. Stay awake, Izzy. Stay awake. Morning. [Megan] Hey, hey. From the corner store. Best espresso in the whole neighborhood. Oh, let me just-- No, no, no, please. It's a gift. I know how brutal the night shift can be before you get adjusted. And after you get adjusted. Well, in that case. Cheers. Mm, that is good. It's amazing, right? My daughter and I just moved to the suburbs near here and don't really know anyone or anything in the neighborhood. Well, now you know where to get good coffee. And now, you know me. Are you studying to get your masters? Yeah, I am, an MBA in theater management. It's one of the reasons I took this job, to get some peace and quiet to study. Be careful what you wish for. You know, you should try listening to classical music when you study. I used do that back in medical school. That's a good idea. Any recs? Yeah, actually, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture will definitely keep you, yeah-- Sorry. It's got the cannons at the end. You know, I actually won a baton that belonged to Tchaikovsky at a charity auction last year. And now that I'm saying that out loud, that is the nerdiest thing I've ever said. I'm so sorry. Well, everybody has a hobby. Anyway, how's the job going? No complaints. Why? No reason. It's just, well, the local high school theater puts on their fall play here and Cameron barely charges them anything, which is totally nice. But she gave a key to the building to the old director, but she barely knew him. I got kind of a creepy vibe. Well, she gave me a key and barely knows me, but she did a background check on me first. Well, I'm just kind of worried about her. There's been a lot of people coming and going at odd hours recently. I mean, the whole neighborhood's talking. Mr. Adams, he owns the diner down the street. He thinks that it's loan sharks. Loan sharks, like people who-- Bust your knee cap or slice your face if you don't pay. I know, scary. Anyway, on that note, I gotta go, but enjoy your coffee. We'll talk soon? I'll be here. [Megan] Awesome. Oh, and thanks again for this. Of course. Enjoy. [Isabel] You have everything you need? Phone, keys, EpiPen? Mom, yes. We've been through all this already. Show me. Happy? Very. Stop worrying. How are you? Fine. Work's okay? Of course, honey. Working nights isn't the greatest, but I get to spend time with you during the day. Lemons into lemonade, right? No coffee. -I passed you a soda. -Sheesh, mom. That's more than enough caffeine. God, it's just coffee. It's not like I'm asking to do drugs. Caffeine is a drug, thank you very much, and it's just as dangerous as any other. Plus, I packed like three energy shots in here. You don't want it. Seriously? Oh yeah, that's not dangerous at all. No wonder you've been so jittery. It's fine. I'm fine. As for you, you should get a good night's sleep tonight instead of chit chatting on the phone. I miss my friends. I know, honey. You'll make new ones. All right. Knock 'em dead, honey. I always do. [Isabel sighing] [horn blaring] [people chattering] Help, help me! [woman screaming] Help me! Stay away from her! Cameron? Come on, Izzy, get a grip. Mr. Cho, I'm Rosaline's mom. We have a meeting? We had a meeting at 4:00. Now, it's nearly 5:00. I really need to speak with you. Ms. Richardson, Rosaline skipped my class, was caught making out with a boy, and didn't submit an essay she was assigned. She has detention and that's final. I understand and I'm very sorry I was late, but I wanna speak with you about Rosaline's behavior, not excuse it. Rosaline, we both have been having a difficult time with the death of her father. My husband. He died last year. Sorry for your loss. After he died, Rosaline's been acting out, skipping school, running off, but she's not a bad kid. We moved here for a fresh start, you know? Have you considered a therapist? Rosaline had brief counseling for a few months last year, but I haven't found anywhere here yet. I can get a referral from the school counselor and you should encourage her to join some clubs. Maybe she can audition for the Fall play. Thanks for the suggestion, but I'm not sure Rosaline is much of a theater kid. Are you sure? This year's play is the "Twelfth Night." It's very funny. The kids always love it. Well, I'll see if she's interested. If she decides to audition, maybe I can pull some strings and get her a part. I know the director. Kidding, everyone gets a part. It's not a very big theater club. He's the one your daughter was getting friendly with. Definitely have to talk to her about that. Anyway, I'll let you know. Ms. Richardson. Call me Isabel. In that case, call me Henry. I'll see you around, Isabel. Hi, mom. Hi. Maybe you could introduce me to your friend. Mom, this is Jonathan. Jonathan, this is my mom. It's nice to meet you, Ms. Richardson. Nice to meet you too, although it would be even nicer if you and my daughter hadn't gotten detention together. Yeah. I should probably get going. My mom's waiting. Oh, maybe you could introduce me. Sure. What? Mom, hey. You're practically grounded for-- Ms. Richardson, this is my mom. Mom, this is Rosaline and her mom. They just moved to town. Yeah, it's good to see you again. It's good to see you again too. Oh, you guys know each other? Well, we never officially exchanged names. I'm Isabel. Megan. Well, I guess we'd better get going. Nice to meet you, Jonathan. I'll see you soon. -Bye. -Bye. Super cute. [Megan] No, I'm just trying to help. [Cameron] You really wanna help? I need another loan. I'm sorry, I have given you all I can give. [Cameron]Do you have any idea what they'll do if I can't pay? You owe me! I'm the one that used my connections for your posh apartment. I'm the one that introduced you! This is a private conversation! -Cameron? -Go. I'm sorry, the door was open. Sit outside and stop drunk people from peeing on the front steps or something. I don't pay you to eavesdrop. I didn't hear anything. [woman screaming] [bus chugging] Okay, I need to scale back on these. Help, help! Somebody's being murdered at 1739 Harwood Street, third floor, downtown, across from the Regent Theater. No! [siren blaring] Hurry, third floor. Can you give us a description of the victim? [Isabel] Yes, she's maybe about five seven, white, long hair. No, no. Chin length hair, wearing a white shirt and red pants. [knocking on door] This is the police, open the door. Officers, can I help you? It can't be. Ma'am, someone reported screams coming from this apartment. Do you live here? I do. I was actually watching a scary movie earlier. Could that be what they heard? What are those scratches from? Oh, my cat. I was trying to give him the bath earlier and he hates water. You're welcome to come in and take a look around. Oh, well, keep the TV down. I will. I'm so sorry about that, officers. Have a good night. Ms. Richardson, are you sure you're all right? What? You look like you've seen a ghost. I saw a woman get murdered. I did. She was pounding on the window, screaming for help. Someone put a rope around her neck, dragged her away. But when we opened the door, there she was. Look, I know how crazy it sounds, but I couldn't make this up. Are these yours? All of them? It's a new job. It's been hard to stay awake. You know caffeine is a powerful mind altering drug. That's what I always tell my daughter. Add in all the chemicals in these energy shots plus the sleep deprivation that has you taking them, your mind can play tricks on you. What are you saying, detective? I'm sure this was scary for you, but no one was killed. You made it up, imagined it. I know what I saw. 24/7 energy boost can have strong side effects. And like I said-- Lack of sleep, I know, but that's not what's happening here. It felt real. Not just felt, it was real. I know it was. If that's the case, then where's the evidence? When your shift is over, you should go home and get a good night's sleep, Ms. Richardson. I'm a single mother of a 16 year old daughter. I'd be lucky to get five hours. At the very least, ease off the caffeine and get some blackout curtains. They really do help. Thank you, detective, really. Morning, mom. How was work? Mom? What's wrong, honey? Nothing, I was just saying good morning. Not like you ever listen to anything I say. Rosaline, I am absolutely not in a mood for this today. Sorry. Oh, Mr. Cho said that I can take a test for extra credit if I come in this morning. Our conversation isn't over, you know? Yeah, I think it is. Rosaline, I don't wanna fight with you. Then why won't you let me date boys, mom? Is that a rhetorical question? It's us against the world, remember, not us against each other. Yeah, but mom, you don't even know Jonathan. Well, when you get your English grade up, we will discuss it. Why are you sitting in the dark anyway? You don't want to open up the curtains, get some light in here? Have you been sleepwalking again? What? No, I'm fine. And thank you. For what? Taking my advice about joining the theater club. I think it'll be good for you. Yeah, we'll see. Oh, the parent-teacher conference is this afternoon. Can you be there? Of course, honey. I'll pick you up from school and we'll drive over together. Cool. Sorry I'm late. You work here? Well, she's-- That's cool. Are you a manager? I'm a security guard, but maybe one day. My mom is studying to be a theater manager. Cool. [Isabel] All right, let's all head inside. After you. I'll be right back. So cute, he used to wear his shirt just like that. For you. Oh, I don't drink coffee, thanks. You don't, since when? I'll take that coffee, mom. Nice try, kid. Stop calling me kid. You're embarrassing me. I'll stop calling you kid when you stop being one. You know what? It's early enough. I'll take it. Thank you. Good, 'cause I wanted to pay you back and to apologize for the other night. -Henry. -Henry? Hey, nice to see you again. You too. Good afternoon, Rosaline, Jonathan, Ms. Everett. Hi, Mr. Cho. Told you, "Twelfth Night," it's hard to resist. Yeah, thanks for that suggestion. [Henry] Okay, everyone. Can we make our way into the theater please? Thank you very much. Half these kids look like they're sleep walking. They could use a good dose of that 1812. What? 1812, the Tchaikovsky Overture you recommended. I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I was gardening the other day and I tripped and fell into my rose bush and got all scratched up. It's kind of embarrassing. Okay. You know, I'm gonna use the ladies room. [suspenseful ambient music] Is everything okay? Oh, yeah, I was just admiring the architecture. The theater has such a beautiful design, right? It isn't my place, but that seemed like a pretty intense argument with you and Cameron last night. Cameron can be a bit intense sometimes, but she's harmless. At least, I think she is. You sure you're okay? You seem different. You know, I'm just dealing with some old wounds that have been reopening recently. My ex-husband, he's, well, we got divorced a year ago. He was sleeping with the secretary. That's horrible. I know, and so cliche too. Anyway, he's been wanting to spend a lot of time with Jonathan recently, and just afraid he is gonna be a bad influence, you know? Burden of being a parent. So what about you? Are you married, divorced? My husband died last year, actually. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Thanks. Tell me about him. Really? If you want to. I mean, you don't have to if it's too painful. It's been 13 months since the car accident. I wanna talk about him. His name was Finn. He was the funniest person I've ever known or ever will know probably. We were best friends from the moment we met. You must really miss him. I do, but I have to keep moving forward for Rosaline. He would've wanted that. Sorry if I've been a bit nosy. I just really appreciate your kindness and wanna make sure you're okay. These nights can be really long and seeing your cheery face each morning with a coffee in hand, it's a lifesaver, so thank you. Well, I'm really glad I met you. I'll see you downstairs? Hello? Hello? Wait a minute. The security footage. [Isabel] Cameron? Is somebody there? [Isabel gasping] Whoever you are, you're trespassing. Leave before I call the police! [intense orchestral music] Isabel, what are you doing here? I work here. What are you doing here? I left my wallet earlier, came back to grab it, heard a noise. Are you all right? What happened? A few nights ago, I witnessed something. A crime, a murder, or I thought it was, but the police don't believe me and I don't have any proof. But look, that's where it happened. It might have been caught on camera, but someone attacked me, destroyed the hard drive. If nothing happened, then why did someone bother to destroy the footage? Isabel. I sound crazy. You've had a shock. We gotta call the cops. So you believe me? When you've eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Sherlock Holmes. You really are an English teacher. It's incurable. [Cameron] Just go to the ER, get your head checked out just in case. I'm fine, really. That's why I said just in case. I agree with Cameron. It can't hurt, right? Detective, can I talk to you outside? This is connected to what happened the other night. Ms. Richardson, nothing happened the other night. Someone hit at me over the head and wrecked the office. It can't be a coincidence. Look, the safe is open. Whoever broke in was looking for cash, got mad when they couldn't find any, and trashed the place. You still believe there was a murder, and what, a coverup? You saw the so-called murder victim with your own two eyes. Ms. Richardson-- I know something happened that night. I know. Good day, Ms. Richardson. I'll meet you up there. Rosaline, what are you doing? Nothing, just cleaning up, hanging up clothes. -Really? -Mm-hmm. It looks like you're trying to pick out an outfit for a date. Who's the lucky boy? Okay, mom, I-- Rosaline May Richardson, you did not ask out that delinquent. Mom, it's one date. What's so wrong with him, mom? It's not him exactly. How well do you even know him or his family? And is it the best idea to start dating someone so soon after the move? Okay, look, I know I freaked you out before, and you want me to stay out of trouble, and I have been, but now I can't meet people? I mean, come on, mom. Didn't you go on dates when you were in high school? Well, of course I did. Then what's the problem? Is it dad or you're lonely so everyone else has to be lonely too? Hey. I'm sorry, but seriously. You know if dad were here, he wouldn't be so weird about it. Fine. You're bound and determined to go out with him, so go ahead, but I'm driving. No, mom, come on. Oh, mom, come on, no. That's the deal. -Take it or leave it. -Fine. Do you have any shoes that'll go with my dress? You're sure they live here? Yeah, why? I thought they had an apartment in town. I don't know, mom. Maybe they have two. Your skirt's a little short, isn't it? Hi, Ms. Richardson. Ready to go? -Mm-hmm. -Sure. Actually, can I talk to your mother for a minute? Oh, she's not here. I think she had a meeting with the lady who owns the theater. Oh, Cameron? Well then, let's go. Love this jacket on you. Looks like she's quite the gardener. I don't see any rose bushes. We don't have any rose bushes. And you don't have a cat, do you? -Mom? -No. What are you doing? Come on, we're gonna be late, come on. Right, let's get you guys to the movies. I actually won a baton that belonged to Tchaikovsky at a charity auction last year. -[knocking on door] -Yes? My shift just ended, came in to say goodbye. [Cameron] Great. Thanks, Isabel. Is there anything else? I wanted to ask you about the case with the costume jewelry. I thought maybe we could move it. No, don't touch that. It's very valuable. I'm sorry. It's just that it doesn't quite fit in the case. I didn't notice it before. Have you had it for a while? No, and it's not gonna be here for long. Where'd you get it? You ask a lot of questions. It was a gift. Someone gave that to you? My gosh. Listen, I'd appreciate it if you kept this quiet kind of like how I've been quiet about your so-called study habits when you were supposed to be working. Are you sure you're okay, mom? Huh? Oh, of course, honey, nothing you need to worry about. You can tell me things if it's money or something. I'm old enough to get an after school job. No, no, no, no, we're fine. I appreciate you offering. Okay. Love you, mom. Mom? Right, have a good day at school. [intense orchestral music] [Isabel screaming] Pull yourself together, Izzy. Stake outs seem a lot more fun in the movies. [Jonathan] Make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that I owe Olivia. Aye, but I know. What dost thou know? [Rosaline] Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man. As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman. I should, your lordship. [Henry] That's great, guys. Let's skip to the end for a bit. Jonathan, wanna start on line 2415? One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons. Let's actually take 10, guys. Awesome work. Good job. -Hey. -Hey. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your rehearsal. No, it's fine. They needed a break anyway. Are you here for the parent fundraising meeting later? Henry, I basically live here. I'm here for a lot of things, but I did wanna talk to you. Oh, about Rosalie? Not about her, per se. You'll think I'm a horrible gossip. Come on, I teach at a high school in the suburbs. I promise you I've heard worse gossip. How well do you know Megan? She's really helped with the theater club this year after Mr. Branson left. Mr. Branson? The old 12th grade English teacher. He ran the theater club until he retired last year. To be honest, I would've been really lost without Megan. She made all the arrangements with Cameron to rent the theater out again. She's the one who made the arrangements with Cameron? Well, Mr. Branson started it all, but she took over as school liaison. Why do you wanna know? Rosaline and Jonathan have been spending a lot of time together and I just wanna know who she's hanging out with. Especially after what happened with the two of them? Maybe I'm being a helicopter mom, but after the year she's had, I just wanna make sure she's okay. I get that. Megan is tenacious. Her ex had great lawyers, but she still ended up with custody, alimony, and the house. She's someone who gets what she wants. [chandelier creaking] Did you hear that? Look out! [chandelier crashing] Are you okay? [Cameron] Tell me what happened-- [Megan] It's so irresponsible. I have no idea. I have no idea. I cannot believe that that's-- -Still on the stage? -Yeah. Do you know what happened at the stage? You know, I don't know. One of the lights fell down and I'm not sure how it happened. It's so terrible, isn't it? It's unsafe. It's scary. I'm Elena. Isabel. This is Sharon, Kelly, Megan. Oh, Megan and I already know each other. Oh. So I hear you're the ones to talk to if I wanna get Rosaline more involved in the theater club? That's right, even though I don't know how much more involved she could be. I mean, she's already the star of the show. Well, it's not really about the theater group. It's more that I'm worried she's not making any friends. We just moved, you know, fresh start. Well, you picked a great place to live, right, ladies? My daughter Therese, she plays Olivia, she's having a slumber party this Saturday. I know she already adores Rosaline. She'd be welcome to come. That sounds great. I appreciate that. You know, you're welcome to hang out with us too. We all go out to a bar when the kids are together. Sounds like a plan. I can't believe Kim wore that to a fundraiser meeting. That's what happens when your husband finds out you're having an affair and then leaves you with the electric bill. Hi, ladies. -Hi. -Hi. -I love the bow. -Oh, thank you. Ladies, let's go to the bar area. I like that idea. Let's go. That's why I'm saying we should just have a bake sale. Oh, come on, Kim, not another bake sale. Last year's bake sale raised a thousand dollars for the fall play. And it was barely enough to build the sets. And besides, come on, everyone, raise your hand if someone in your family has some sort of dietary restriction. Sorry, bake sales are a waste of time. Okay, then what's your great idea? Black tie fundraiser. We invite the whole community, even the kids. That's not a bad idea. Okay. And where would we have this? Maybe one of our houses. I'll volunteer my house. Oh, we could charge for tickets, but still have a silent auction, a dance portion. Maybe even a dinner. Just do a whole event. Well then, shall we put it to a vote? Sure. All those in favor of my brilliant idea, raise your hand. Mm-hmm, that's great. [Megan] Oh, come on, Kim, don't leave like that. You can bring your snickerdoodles to the party. Queen Megan reigns supreme. So, you excited for your sleepover? It's not a sleepover. It's not? So I should come pick you up after the movie then? No, I mean, I'm sleeping at Therese's, but it's not like a sleepover, sleepover. Those are for kids. Right, 'cause you're so grown. Mom, come on. And even if it were a sleep over, I can't act like I'm excited. That's right, 'cause you're pretending to be all cool and mysterious. I'm not pretending, mom. I am cool and mysterious. I'm sure you are, honey. -Hey. -Hey. Oh, Therese hasn't talked about anything except Rosaline for the past two days. Aww, she really likes her too. Therese tells me that Rosaline is the coolest girl in school, and clearly all the rest of them agree. I guess it's all about confidence. Fake it til you make it, right? Yeah. Girls, you can put your bags up in Therese's room and then we're gonna leave. Jonathan, is your dad meeting us at the theater or here? The theater, I guess. All right, cool. All right, let's get going. -So I'll see you later? -Definitely. Okay. Have fun, honey. Oh, Jonathan, I could use your help in the kitchen. Hey, you're not gonna go to the bar with us? No, thanks. Tonight's my night off, so I just kinda wanna go home and get some sleep. Come on, I know the long nights at the theater must be pretty lonely. Come on, I'd really like to just know you. Yeah? You know what, sure. -I'll see you there. -Great Hey. So sorry I'm late. I had to, it doesn't matter. I just, I'm here. Did you order? Is everyone else still on their way? Right, no, actually. They decided to stay and watch the movie. Pretty sure they're just trying to be like slick chaperones, so it's just us. Oh, well, okay. That's great though. We can have some good one on one time. Sure. Mm, thank you. Enjoy. Here, have some. Oh no, I'm fine. I'm allergic to shellfish. Rosaline and I both are actually. I'm sorry, should I not have ordered this? Oh no, no, no, it's fine. I just can't have any. Okay, sorry. So, how is the theater? It's fine. Yeah? You sure? What do you mean? No, I just know that the theater's had some financial problems, and Cameron's messed up with some bad people, and I'm just worried about her. It's fine. She's fine. Good, 'cause the theater's been a lifesaver for Jonathan with the whole divorce. Yeah. It's been really helpful with Rosaline and the death of her father also. Yeah, you know, you and I are actually a lot alike. You think so? I don't think we are very much alike. Well, we have more in common than other parents at school. How so? Well, you're a widow and I'm divorced. We both know what it's like to lose the life we were supposed to live. What do you mean by that? Nevermind, you probably wouldn't understand. No, no, try me. I want to understand. I want to understand you. Okay, well, I was adopted. I never really knew my birth parents, so I don't remember them or anything, but my adoptive parents, they never really cared about me much. I wasn't even a kid to them. It was more of a tool or a pawn really just to help elevate their status in life. That's awful. Yeah, it was. I played the role I was expected to play. I married my high school sweetheart, I had a baby, I stayed home, all of that. You know, it was never like I thought it would be. But now that's gone, and now I'm the divorced mom, and I don't even know what I'm supposed to do next. I know life plans can change in an instant, in a fraction of a second, but you still have time, don't you? Oh yeah, time for what? Time for whatever, anything, whatever you want to do. It doesn't matter. It's not like you've made any huge mistakes. You still have a chance, right? I'm gonna use the ladies room. [sirens blaring] Cameron, I'm starting my shift. Cameron? Oh my god, Cameron! Oh my god, hold on. Hold on, I'm gonna call somebody. You're gonna be okay, okay? [Detective] Anything else you can tell me? No. All right, I'll check with the daytime guard and see what else I can get from them. We don't have a daytime security guard, just me. Financial-- Troubles, I got that. I have to see if Cameron has any family to call. I can't believe the cameras were disconnected again. Don't beat yourself up. Cameron may have done that on purpose. We received an anonymous tip that a valuable baton had been stolen from a resident across the street. Stolen? That may have been what you saw that night, Cameron breaking in. We think she took it to cover her debts. You really think she stole it? We'll do some further investigation. I'll see myself out. Celine Russell? I'm a private investigator. Your family hired me. They just wanna make sure you're okay. My family? Yeah, I guess they would be a little worried, but I'm fine. You can tell them that. They didn't need to hire a private investigator. Well, they're more than a little worried. I think if you told them yourself that you're okay, it would go a long way. They just wanna know what's going on with you. Nothing's going on with me. I just don't wanna talk with them. They should respect that. Well, they're concerned. Your father gave me a message to pass on if I saw you. He doesn't understand why you quit your job at the hospital, but said, if you need money, you can always come to him. How nice of him. Well, no one's heard from you in a month. Surely, you can see why they may wonder what's going on. If you're unhappy or hurt, there are people who want to help. Well, I'm fine. You're an investigator. You found me. Your job's done. I do have one last message from your family. Your mother told me to ask you if I found you if all of this has anything to do with your sister? I said, I'm fine, all right? I just don't wanna talk to them. They should respect that and so should you. Look, I don't know why you're angry with them. Maybe you have a good reason, but if you cut yourself off from your family, be certain that's really what you want. That wound takes a long time to heal. That's none of your business. The next time I see you, I'm gonna call the cops. -I understand. -Yeah, great. [phone vibrating] What did you wanna talk to me about? Said you needed my help with something. Did it have something to do with the light that came crashing down? Not exactly. Maybe. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked you to come here. Isabel, no, of course you should have. What's wrong? I'm sorry, this was a mistake. I'll see you at the fundraiser, okay? -[people chattering] -[upbeat pop music] Oh, there's Jonathan, and Therese, and everyone. He looks so cute. Go have fun, honey. I'll talk to you later. All right, I'll see you when the auction starts. As long as you don't expect me to buy you one of those expensive aromatherapy baskets. -Just one. -I love you, but not that much. Hey, Isabel. Hey, Sharon. You know where the bathroom is? I've never been here before, but I just saw Megan. Let me go look. Oh no, no, no. She's probably hosting. I'll find it myself. Okay. What are you doing? Henry, hi. Am I interrupting? Oh, Megan asked me to come here and look for something. Celebrity headshots for the auction. Oh, I wasn't aware that Megan collected headshots. Yeah. Yeah, her ex-husband's cousin was a collector and they got all of her things before she died. Huh, that's very generous of her to donate to the auction. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing here? Oh, came to drop off my coat. Can I help you look? Oh no, you don't have to. No, I insist. You don't need to do it all by yourself. Oh, it's fine. I got it really. [Kim] Megan, are you in here? Oh no. Oh, hi. Hi, Kim, Mrs. Bradford. You can call me Kim. It's okay, Mr. Cho. Sorry to interrupt. I was looking for Megan. She's not here. I can see that. Well, I'll leave you two to it then. What was that? I misled you about why I'm here. Misled? You mean lied. Isabel, what's really going on here? Remember when I told you I thought I saw a murder? Well, Cameron's involved and I think Megan is too, but I'm not sure if it was a murder or something else. You think I'm crazy? No, Megan's been acting really strange lately. Something's up with her, I know it. But why would she do this? Oh, she's involved in Cameron's money troubles, but I'm not sure how yet. I tried to get into her apartment the other day, but she was there so I'm looking for evidence here. You know what? [indistinct] How can I help? Check that box. [Kim] Megan? You know, I think we need more grapes. Do you have some more? Of course. -Let me get that for you. -Okay. What are we even looking for? I don't know. Maybe it's just a fools errand. Megan and Celine reunited after all this time? Who's Celine? And why is her half missing? -Call 9-1-1! -Oh my gosh, Rosaline! [intense orchestral music] [Jonathan] She just collapsed all of a sudden. I don't know what happened. It's all right, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, you're okay. Come on, okay, okay. Will Rosaline be okay? For now, but epinephrine is only temporary so I have to get her to the hospital before it wears off. Are you okay to walk? Okay, come on. Come on. Is your daughter all right? She's fine. We're waiting on some labs to be processed. Ms. Richardson, if-- Megan Everett poisoned my daughter. Rosaline has a deadly allergy and she knew it. That's a serious accusation. You how easily cross-contamination can spread. What's your daughter allergic to, milk, nuts? Shellfish. I picked the food and made sure there were none on the menu. Look, I don't expect you to take it on faith, but I made everything except these. Those were Megan. If you test one, I'm sure you'll find shellfish residue. Even if I find traces of shellfish, it could be a coincidence. Just run the test please. Ms. Richardson, we just can't run lab tests on a whim. Do you have kids, Detective? I have a daughter, Claire. How would you feel if someone tried to hurt Claire? What would you do? I wouldn't rest until I was sure she was safe. I know it's a big ask. If the tests turn up nothing, I'll stop bothering you about all of it, but I have to keep Rosaline safe. I'll see what I can do. Look, I'm not supposed to talk about ongoing investigations, but we found the loan shark. It turns out Cameron paid in full, so whoever harmed her, it must have been for another reason. How much did she owe them? Around 30,000. But like I said, she paid it. I'll let you know about those test results. Henry, over here. What are we doing? I don't want anyone to see us. I got that. Thanks for playing hooky from work. You said you needed my help. Is Rosaline okay? She's fine. She's just afraid she lost her cool girl cred. She went to school, but I can't promise she's actually in class and not hiding under the bleachers. No, the kids love her. I'm sure it'll take more than last night to knock her off her pedestal. [Isabel shushing] You okay? I'm fine, I'm just tired. I was up all night at the hospital. Any idea what happened? I think Megan poisoned Rosaline. You what? So I have to figure out how to get into that apartment building and find the evidence. Hold on there, "Rear Window." Are we breaking in? If you don't wanna help me-- I didn't say that. Look, I saw what happened last night just like you did. I'm convinced there's something strange going on around here. I can't pick the lock to the front door, so we have to wait till someone comes outside. Like him? I thought you said you couldn't pick locks. Just the front ones of the building. I may have watched a lot of online tutorials on how to pick locks. Got it. [Henry] Impressive. Internet's finest. I'll check in here. You can check down there. Celine? [Henry] Isabel, I think I found something. This must be Celine. So there were two people in the apartment that night? Is something wrong? It's Detective Novac. He had the brownies that Rosaline ate last night tested and he just told me that the results came back positive for glucosamine powder, which is made with shellfish. It's a joint supplement, not a baking ingredient. That has to have been added on purpose. If she did that to Rosaline. This curtain, it's new. Why would she redecorate if she wasn't planning on coming back? Because the original curtain was the perfect size to wrap up a body. We should go. Good call. Where's my phone? I must have left it. Stay here, I'll be right back. Henry, wait-- Wait, wait, ah! Henry, oh my god! 9-1-1, I need an ambulance. Where were you? I called you like 10 times! I had to get a ride with Therese and her mom. Rosaline, you might wanna sit for this. Okay. You'll probably hear about this at school, but I want you to hear it from me first. Mr. Cho is in a coma. Is he gonna be okay? The doctors aren't sure when he'll regain consciousness or if he ever will. That's horrible. First, your boss and now Mr. Cho. Wait, how do you know about Mr. Cho being in a coma? Well, Henry and I. Henry and I? What's going on between you two? We'll talk about that later. For now, there have been some strange things going on lately and I don't wanna have to tell you this, but I think it's Jonathan's mom. I believe she's behind this, your anaphylactic shock, and even the light falling from the ceiling in the theater. That's crazy. Yeah, I know it's a lot and I don't wanna have to suggest this, but I think you should avoid Jonathan for a bit, just until things straighten out. Are you kidding me? Is this still about me seeing Jonathan? Rosaline, of course not. No, no, no, you're crazy. That's crazy. I told you, I told you that all those energy shots were bad for you. They scrambled your brain up or something. Well, hold on now. No, you're telling me that my boyfriend's mom tried to kill me and the theater director? Mom, that's nuts! What's her motive? Why would she have done any of this? Well, she's after me specifically. Why, what did you do? I didn't do anything, but I believe she killed somebody and I saw it happen. No, I don't believe you. You're hallucinating, sleepwalking like you did right after dad died. And you're doing it again, mom, ruining my life with your overactive imagination. And if dad were still here-- Rosaline, that's enough. I know your father isn't here and I wish every day that he was, but I can't bring him back. All I can do is try to keep you safe, so I'm asking, stay away from Megan and Jonathan. Okay? [knocking on door] Rosaline, I made you dinner if you're hungry. Rosaline? I'm really sorry about all this, honey. I think we just need to stay away from the Everetts for a bit. Rosaline, if you don't wanna talk to me, you don't have to, but at least come out and get something to eat. All right, I'm coming in Rosaline, honey, I know you're mad at me, but you can't just sneak out. [Megan] Hello, Isabel. Megan? What did you do to my daughter? [Megan] Oh, oh, do you wanna know? Don't you hurt her. [Megan] We're at the theater. Come alone. [suspenseful orchestral music] Rosaline, Rosaline, oh my god. I'm gonna get you out of here, honey. I'm gonna get you out. Where's Megan? What? What? Mom, she's behind you! [loud thudding] Mom, mom, no, mom! No, what are you doing, mom? No! Please wake up, please wake up. Baby, did she hurt you? Mom, I'm so sorry. Mom, I'm so sorry. Mom, she texted me from Jonathan's phone. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just had to make sure you didn't bring anyone with you. Well, I didn't want you to hurt my daughter. Well, I didn't wanna hurt your daughter either, but unfortunately, here we are. What are you gonna do? Oh, are you scared? Does this scare you? Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you with these. That's ridiculous. I have a better idea. Imagine the headlines, security guard and her daughter parish in a tragic fire at the historic Regent Theater. Consider how old the wiring is, I think it's pretty smart. Don't you? Ms. Everett, please don't do this, please don't. Oh, Rosaline, Rosaline. Please believe me when I tell you I don't want to do this, but your mom just wouldn't stop even after I warned her, even after I got rid of the security tapes, even after I got rid of Cameron. She just wouldn't let it go. So you did hurt Cameron? You're the one who hit me in the head and trashed the office. But how did you break in? No, you didn't. You have a key to the theater. Henry told me how helpful you were with the theater club when Mr. Branson was head. That's pretty much the one thing that being a suburban housewife taught me is to use your connections. You know what? Let's just get this over with. I'm tired and I'm gonna have a long day tomorrow consoling Jonathan. Please don't do this, please don't do this. I don't have a choice. It's too late. It's too late for what? I know you killed someone. Celine. That was her name, right? But why, what happened? Why did you kill her, Megan? Oh my god, you just have to know, don't you? You just have to know. She was my sister, my twin sister, Celine Russell. God, what a stupid rich person name, right? We were adopted out separately. You know, I didn't even know I had a sister most of my life Until I met Cameron. And then she told me about a woman who lived across the street that looked exactly like me. We were so excited to meet each other. We'd been living in the same city for years and we didn't even know. That night, she invited me over for dinner. She wanted to brag about how she just passed her medical license exam. Now, she was Dr. Celine Russell. Woo. Gosh, she was always doing things like that, always rubbing it in my face, always bragging about how perfect her life was, but she said she wanted to celebrate her accomplishments with her sister. A bunch of garbage. She had all these fancy things, fancy friends, people who actually cared about her. And now, she had a fancy new career. She had such an interesting life, stories to tell about how she traveled the world and rubbed elbows with the social elite. And I had none of that. All I had was a jerk ex-husband, an annoying son, and a circle of fake friends that will laugh about me behind my back any chance they get. Was that all I had to show for my life because I did what was expected of me and Celine didn't? And then, oh, and then she had the nerve to say, "I can't believe how perfect my life is. I'm so lucky." I didn't mean to kill her. I snapped. It was a split second decision that I will carry around for the rest of my life, but I couldn't stand to see the smug look on Celine's face, not for one more second! Jonathan? I was just looking for my phone. I thought I left it here earlier. You killed someone. Jonathan, let me explain. Just listen. And now, you're trying to kill them. Baby, I have to. They know what I did. I won't let you. I'm sorry, I have to. -No, mom, stop. -[loud thudding] I'm so sorry. -[women grunting] -[intense music] I didn't mean to kill Celine. I'm sorry. It doesn't matter if you meant to do it, you killed someone. You heard her, boys. Megan Everett, you're under arrest for murder. Glad you could make it. Jonathan. Jonathan. Jonathan, look at me. [Isabel] You were right about one thing. You will carry this for the rest of your life. So, how was school? Fine. Mr. Henry announced the spring musical. I can't believe you talked him into "The Music Man." So corny. Hey, I'm managing the Regent now that Cameron's in physical therapy. Well, I'm so grateful she gave me this opportunity. No more overnights and no more energy drinks. But why do you even like "The Music Man?" Excuse me, it's a classic and it's Cameron's favorite. I told Henry that the school was gonna be renting the space, it has to be "The Music Man." And I wanted to do something nice for Cameron for when she's back. Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, what's up with all this? What? You're just smiling and cheesing. No, I'm not. Jonathan's moving back. I mean, and we can be together if that's okay with you though. Hey, Jonathan's worst influence is behind bars, so I'd say I'm fine with that. And hey, maybe we can all go on a double date. Mom, I'm not gonna go on a double date with you, my English teacher, and my boyfriend. No, no way, that's annoying. Wow, thanks. But I'm glad you're my mom, even through it all. Even when you told me I'm ruining your life? Even then. You know, other people aren't so lucky, so. No, they're not. And I won't let you forget it. Yuck. Love you too, mom. All right, let's go.
