Does anybody here speak English? That's a good one, sir. Where is this? What? But where please, could you tell me where? 20 miles south of Aberystwyth. Aberystwyth? You mean Wales? Wales, that's it, sir, where else? Wales, Wales. Oh, excuse me. Could you tell me the date? - Fifth. Fifth. Thank you very much. July? September. September. September. I wonder what I'm doing in Wales. I woke with the most peculiar feeling this morning. It is this morning, isn't it? It just suddenly occurred to me, it might be this afternoon after all, or even this evening. When I opened my eyes I saw a pink lamp shade, then my feet, then I looked in the mirror, and I didn't know me. I don't know how I got here I don't remember leaving anywhere, or why I came... I don't even know who I am. In fact, I don't remember anything... Afternoon all, afternoon. Hello Thomson. - Good afternoon sir. Thank you, doctor. How's the patient? Still a blank? - Well just the same. This is Professor Llewellyn, department of psychological medicine, South Wales. How do you do? Come 70 miles to see you. You sound just my meat. U see you've called him Mr. X, pretty hackneyed old man, pretty hackneyed. No external injuries? - Only a few minor bruises. Oh well, let battle commence. Sit down please. I'm going to try a word association test. I'm going to fire a string of words at you. I want you to reply each time with the first word that comes into your head. You ready? Uh, grass. Green. Book. - Maker. Cork. - Champagne. Name. Don't know. Spring. - Mendelssohn. Food. - Zabaglione. Come again? - Zabaglione. What's that? - I've no idea. It's an Italian sweet, sir, take the yolks of egg, Marsala and sugar, you whip up the eggs and then you get... - Yes, yes, yes, thanks very much, mhm. Winter. - Monte Carlo. Now, you'll be glad to hear that there's no question of brain disease or anything like that. This is a purely functional thing. Functional? I mean I can find no physical reason for it. You're a very interesting case. You remain aware of what one might call the general background of events but the you that you know now has become out of touch with you as you were before this happened. How? - Well your mind has shut out your past like a sort of watertight door. But why? Well, shock. Overstrain, some crisis perhaps. We'll know when you're identified. Well how long am | going to be like this? Well it's difficult to say. Could be any length of time. What? Well, isn't there any treatment? Yes, the safest way would be to return you to your accustomed surroundings. Yes, but we don't know my accustomed surroundings. Well, I admit that is a slight difficulty. Slight? Well the police have only known for a few days. I don't even know what sort of character I am. | couldn't sleep last night thinking about it. What do I do? Am I good or bad? I might be anything or anybody. Oh no, not quite. You're obviously familiar with life about town, and used to having money in your pockets. Your tailor's name isn't in your suit, but anyone can see it's a Saville Row job. Ah no, I should say that you're travelled, well-educated, and quite probably cultured. Yes, but I don't think that helps us at all. I might be anything from an archdeacon to a confidence man, they travel. Yes, yes, exactly. Well, if there's been no development by the time I return I'll try hypnosis or penthathol. You aren't going away? Only for two or three days. I have to pop up to town for a scientific meeting. Meanwhile, take it easy, just relax. Relax? Good evening Professor, can I have a word with you? I'm in a hurry Sergeant, what is it? I think we may have some information about your patient. Yes, it's just come in. What are you? Who the devil are you? The Law? The Church? Musician? Oh no. The sporting world? Titled perhaps? Oh. A clue, a clue. - What? Some news has just come through about a car. Austin A40 GBX 676. Discovered in a ditch new Llangollen, early morning of the fifth. We've traced it to a Drive Yourself firm in London, Car Loan Limited. He's just called them. - That's right. They say it was hired on the night of the fourth by a person of your general description. The dates fit too. This may be it. You'd better come up to London with me in the morning. Call for you 7:30 sharp, right? Right. We oughta be there by four. Supposing they don't know me? You'll be no worse off. I must get those tappets quietened down. Well sir, these old speed model three litre Bentleys always were a little noisy at low speeds. That's right. You remember that, do you? What, oh yes, I suppose I do. How extraordinary. This is the place. Coming in? Do I have to? - What's the matter, nervous? A bit. - All right, you wait here. Great news. - Do they know me? Yes, you hired that car all right. Here it is. Mr. Charles Hathaway, Leighton House, Mordon Road, Hampstead, NW3. Hathaway. - That's you. Ring a bell? No. - Never mind, get in. Where are we going? Home, Mr Hathaway, home. Wait a minute, yes, there it is. Leighton House, and very nice too. Mine? - Presumably. You recognise it? No. Here we go. No! I wonder what we shall find on the other side. Supposing... We'll see. Why sir, this is a pleasure. What a nice surprise. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. We didn't expect you back quite so soon sir. Oh, didn't you? Of course not. Well he's pleased to see you. Yes sir, he always goes crazy when he hears the master's steps. Down Mark Anthony, down. Come dog, down, good dog, good dog you. Madam's in the studio, sir. Madame? Come along children. Hurry up, come along. Come on. How many did you make it? Seven. Might as well know the worst. Ready for another Monica? - In a second. I'll brighten the kids up a bit. Now, let's have a smile dears. Now keep absolutely still. Fine. Just one more children and then you can all go home. Gladys, put a jelly in number two, will you? Okay, Monica. Darling! Oh, what a wonderful surprise. Oh, how lovely to have you back so soon. Er yes. Oh, this is Professor Llewellyn, er... From Wales. - How do you do Mrs. Hathaway? How do you do? Wales? - Yes. That's right. - Yes, he comes from Wales. Oh, then you must be another boffin. Boffin? - Yes. Ready Monica. - Okay, shan't be a minute. Charles will mix us a drink, won't you Charles? How about the lighting Monica? Just the same. Ready? She's a charmer, old man. Drink. - Over here. What am I going to have did you say Charles? This is a most extraordinary situation, Professor. Why, don't you like her? Well, that's scarcely the point, I don't know her. As far as I'm concerned she's a complete stranger. Well, we must look on the bright side. Think of all your morbid fancies of yesterday and then look at all this. And by gosh, Charles. Look at all that. We're all ready now Monica. Now keep quite still. Lovely voice. - Yes, lovely. Sorry about all that, but we're nearly through. Where's my drink? Oh, I beg your pardon. What would you like? - Oh, darling, the usual of course. - The usual? Might I have a word with you, please? Hmm? - About Charles? Charles? - I think we should have a little talk, Mrs Hathaway. I think it'd be an awfully good idea, Mrs Hathaway. What? Shall we wander into the hall? Come on children, that's all for the day. You can all go home, run along. Hurry up dears. - Come on. Yes, that'll be all children, now hurry up and change. That's just about the best photo Monica's ever taken, I can't imagine why you wouldn't let her exhibit it. Uh, modesty, perhaps? Nobody would accuse you of that, Charles. Oh, well, that's worth knowing. Come along girls. Good afternoon Mr. Hathaway. Oh, good afternoon. Charles. Oh, Charles, you poor darling. You poor thing. - It is a bit of a mess. I'm awfully sorry. - Your wife has taken it wonderfully well. - Well I've scarcely had time. I've been so afraid of something like this. Charles has such a terribly responsible position. Oh? - I wasn't so far wrong. It appears you're quite a senior official at the Ministry of Munitions. Oh yes, you're second in command of their research administration. Am I really? Oh, splendid. Well the whole thing's clear to me now. You've obviously been bottling up all your worries without saying a word to the little woman. The Ministry sends you to Wales, car skids into ditch, concussion triggers off an attack of functional amnesia, and bob's your uncle. That sort of thing's absolutely rampant in our scientific departments these days. Indirectly, I expect you're a casualty of the Cold War. Well, I fancy that clears up the mystery. Overstrain in a nightmare world. I'm sorry darling, it's just taken me unawares. Yes, of course. I'm writing a little note for you. You should report to the Ministry as soon as you feel fit. A period of sick leave should put you right. Meanwhile, I'm confident that everything will come back if both of you will be patient. When it happens, Mrs Hathaway, I want you to make an exact note of his behaviour for me. You can find me at the Clinical Society during the next couple of days. Well, I'm so glad to have seen you safely home. You're not going to leave me? My dear chap, I have a paper to read. But, we can put you up here. Can we? - Of course. Please, of course. - No, no. Your best plan is to lead a completely normal life. You'd find that a little difficult with a medical cuckoo in the nest. Well, you can stay for dinner anyway. Well I'm sorry, a crowded meeting awaits me. Admission is free I'll look in before I go back, good bye. Oh darling, I could do with that drink. I wouldn't say no to another myself. Finished now Monica. Oh fine, Gladys, goodnight. See you tomorrow. - Goodnight Mrs Hathaway. Goodnight girls. - Goodnight Goodnight. The usual, by the way, is gin with a dash of dry sherry. I will mix it. Forgive me, but how long have we been married? Five months and three days. Oh, is that all? Are we happy? - Terribly. Oh, good. May I ask a stupid question? What kind of a person am I? You're careless and untidy. Very selfish. You snap at me in the morning, and you spend ages in the bathroom. In fact, you're awfully sweet and I love you very much. Where do we keep the ice? Under the counter. - Thanks. What on earth was I doing on the Atlantic coast of Wales? I've no idea. - What? No, you've been off on these jobs two or three times before. Top secret. - Oh, I see. You were there with me one minute, and gone the next. There, where? At your club, the Adelphi, last Thursday week. It was the 50th anniversary, and they were having a ladies night. We were having supper on the terrace and you went to the buffet to fetch me a zabaglione. A zabalg... what? You remember? - No, not a thing. The zabaglione seems to have stuck for some curious reason, that's all. Did I get it? - No, Jack Carter came back with it instead, saying that you'd asked him to see me home. Who? - Jack Carter. Your best man at our wedding. Oh, I'm so sorry. You telephoned before midnight, and explained that old J.F. was sending you off on an urgent mission. Old J.F.? - Oh honey, J.F. Hasset, the head of your department at the Ministry. My boss? - Yes. Oh, well then he'll know all about it. Well of course, absolutely everything. Oh good, well then I'll ask him. There we are. Well, what about you? Oh dear. Well, I've been married before. It didn't work out. I suppose I'm an independent type. It does seem terribly funny having to tell you this all over again, darling. - Yes, it must. Then my aunt died and left me this place. You mean it's yours? - Yes, darling, of course it is. All of it? - Yes. Oh. - I converted it with the money she gave me, gave up the fashion magazine, and sort of set up here on my own. You know, a disillusioned career girl, determined never to lose my independence again. Then you came along and I suppose you swept me off my feet, darling. Did 1? Really? - You see, I'd never believed things actually happened this way. Suddenly everything seemed to take on a different look. Yes, I know exactly what you mean. Yes, I... Well how do you know if you don't remember? Well, I naturally took it for granted we shared the experience. - Yes, but now you've forgotten me. Me, and where we keep the ice. Well, it hasn't gone forever you know. Llewellyn made that quite clear. It's all in here somewhere, it's just a question of winkling it out. It's his language, not mine. Yes, I know, he told me. He... I wonder if... What is it? Look, darling, it's just something I've thought of that might work. In fact, I'm sure it might. Well, what? - Shock treatment. Oh. - No, no, darling. Wait and see after dinner. Horrocks. Horrocks? Horrocks? Do you mind if we have coffee in here Charles? Not in the least, not in the least. Cigar, sir? Oh, yes, thank you. Thank you Bridget. Did you hear what I said? - What? It's coming back, it must be coming back. I said, "Thank you Bridget". Oh darling, her name isn't Bridget. It's Clara. - Oh, is it? I wonder where I got Bridget from? Well, perhaps it's one of the girls at the office. Yes, perhaps. You know, up until this afternoon I was seriously worried. I might have been absolutely anyone, even a murderer. Instead of which, I've got a job of national importance, a beautiful and talented wife, it's all too good to be... Oh. - Ready, Madam? Yes Horrocks, go ahead. Oh, Horrocks. I told you I had an idea. You're going to see yourself as you were, darling. And how we first met, and then you'll remember, I'm sure you will. - What, you mean? Shh. The Golf Club, you took this bit yourself. I did? - On Jack's camera. He gave us the film as part of his wedding present. There's Jack Carter. - No. Jack wanted to see what his swing looked like, so he foolishly handed over the camera to you. Oh darling, you had a roving eye. Look. By George, it's you. Oh, the very first time we met. I was with Jill, remember? - No. You couldn't take your eyes off me, you said. You forgot all about poor old Jack's swing, he was simply furious. Oh I say. Did we really meet like that? Truthfully. Three weeks later we were married, we had the reception here in the garden. Hmm. He remembers, don't you Mark? Yeah, lucky dog. That's typical of you I'm afraid darling. Oh, is that so? Ah, is that all? You don't remember? Not yet but... - Not after that? Well... It didn't mean anything at all? Nothing? - Well, it was very pleasant, of course. - But I could never imagine myself ever forgetting you. I feel simply terrible about this, but there's nothing in the least personal about it, you know. - How right you are. Well that is to say it's purely functional. Whatever that may mean. - Oh please, Monica. Oh. Well you're looking at me like some sort of an uncle. What, well it's quite unintentional, I assure you. I assure you, I assure you. This is what happens when you let yourself become emotionally dependent on somebody. I always swore I'd never let it happen again, I should have known better. Er, um, Monica? We had all this out before we were married. What? - Well, what did you say in June? - I've no idea. You carry on with your career, I'll carry on with mine. I wouldn't dream of interfering. That's what you said. - Well I haven't interfered. Or have I? - I mean, how on earth can one possibly concentrate on one's career in a situation like this? - I may not be ticking over very well yet, but I don't see the connection at all. It's perfectly obvious. - Well, it may be obvious to you Monica, but it's... - I answer to Mrs Hathaway, remember? - Oh really. You think I'm being unreasonable, don't you? Well... - Well, you're perfectly right I'm behaving abominably. I ought to be ashamed of myself, and so I am. Utterly, well I apologise. - Well then I accept. Well, be that as it may, you will no doubt be relieved to hear in the present circumstances I intend to make no demands upon you of any kind whatsoever. I know I'm being an absolute beast, so there's no point in telling me. Clara will bring up your breakfast. Goodnight. Sick leave. - What? Hmm? The professor said it might do the trick. I thought... Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought if I went to the Ministry tomorrow, I could show his letter to old B.F. J.F. - J.F. I mean, I ought to report anyway. Charles, that's a very good idea, I'll drive you in myself first thing in the morning. Oh will you really? That's fine, well er... Goodnight. - Charles? Yes? - I suppose I am just a teeny bit difficult to live with. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Well, um, goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight, darling. Good... Good morning sir. - Good morning. Good morning sir. - Good morning, uh... Horrocks. - Oh, Horrocks, good morning. Here we are. I suppose this is the right entrance. I've never been here before. Now you're sure you've got the letter from the Professor? Er, yes. What did you say his name was, Bassett? No, Hassett. - What's he like? I don't know, I've never met him. Go on darling, I'll wait for you here. Oh, and be firm about that sick leave. You bet. Morning. - Morning. Morning sir. - Morning. Morning miss. - Good morning. Good morning sir. - Good morning. Good morning. - Good morning. Morning. - Morning Is Mr Hassett in yet? - I don't know sir. That's his office, first on the left. Good morning, J.F. Good morning Hathaway. I thought I ought to come and see you without delay... To explain. - Is this the place for an explanation? - Why not, sir? I should have thought that was obvious, even to you. But surely you want to know why it is I'm not in Wales. - Wales? Yes sir. - I completely fail to see what Wales has to do with it. You sent me there, sir. - I did? Yes sir. Perhaps you've forgotten? Are you quite well, Hathaway? No sir, that's why I wanted to see you. You'd be much better advised to see a doctor. Oh I've done that sir. I have a letter, he suggests sick leave. Sick leave? - Well naturally, as my boss. Your boss? - Well, I- I- I- work here. Don't I? If you work anywhere Hathaway, which I beg leave to doubt, it's most certainly not here. But look... - Yes, Mr Hassett? Yes, Mr Hassett? - Kindly show this gentleman out. - But, just a minute sir. I can well understand that your conduct cries out for an explanation. But the proper place for it, when you've recovered from your delirium, is the Club. The Club? - Always supposing that you dare to show your face there again. I'm completely at a loss. - Good, show him out. Come along sir. B.F., Mr Bassett, Hassett. Make sure he leaves the building. Excuse me. Sergeant? - Yes. I suppose you know everybody in the building. Yes, pretty well, I think. Now, look at me carefully, have you ever seen me before? Oh yes, sir. When? Just now, when you came in. - Oh. Charles. Charles! Darling, where on earth were you off to? Further along. - What? I thought you'd parked further along. Oh darling, what is the matter? Didn't you see J.F.? - Yes, I saw him. Well did he let you have it? Yes. Er, what? - Sick leave. Oh yes, yes, of course. - Well, how long? Er, a month? A month? Oh darling, how marvellous. We'll close up the studio at the end of the week and we'll hop over to Paris. Or would old J.F. think that was too far for you to go? No, old J.F. wouldn't think that was too far for me to go. Yes, but if I never worked at the Ministry at all | must have been living a lie for months. It's terrifying. - Yet Hassett recognised you. Yes, well I must have met him somewhere else and pinched his background. - Well, if you didn't go to the office, where did you go? Look. I see. What about the salary you can't be getting? Well, I asked Monica in a roundabout sort of way, apparently I'm paying my uncle's debts off with it. Hmm. - Exactly. I can't take her to Paris after this. Just when I was getting to know her, too. This is fantastic, what a case. You don't seem to realise, I'm beginning to be seriously concerned about my character. What were you doing in Wales, I wonder. The Ministry certainly never sent you. No, that's true. And then at the Adelphi Club. Something obviously happened there. Obviously. The Club and Wales. I'm going, I'm driving back there tonight. Here, how about a two-pronged attack. I'll take Wales, you take the Club. What, where I daren't show my face again? That's right. - Oh no, now look. Thank you. Good evening. Good uh... Good evening. Large scotch. Well! You're Jack Carter. - You sound surprised. Keeping well, Jack? Where the devil have you been? Wales. - Wales? I never seem to get very far with that. What? - Have a drink, barman? What, um... The usual for Mr Carter. I suppose you're wondering how I dare to show my face in here again. Well, I mean, it would have been excusable if you'd been roaring tight, but Monica tells me you only had one glass of champagne. Uh? - Oh, it's all right, I only told her what you told me to. Oh, you mean the night of the Club party? Well of course, yes, what else? Oh, oh, what else indeed. Your luck was in. Most people thought it was an accident at first. An accident? - Yes, well they thought the fellow had tripped over something and was too near the balcony to stop himself. Oh. I suppose they realised later? You bet they realised later. What? Hmm? What? - What? What did they realise later? That you knocked him over the balcony, you idiot! Oh. Did he... Could he... Was he... What? Dead. - Hmm, what? Dead? - Huh? Dead, no, no, no, no, a sprained ankle and a black eye. Oh, well it might have been much worse. Well that's an infirmly callous way of looking at it, I must say. Though no worse than your behaviour at the time. You shoved the plate in my hand and told me to... I know what was on that plate, zabaglione. Of all the cold-blooded fish, you might have killed him. It's not as if he was one of the Club waiters, either. Oh that's what he was, oh wasn't he? You know perfectly well he came from an outside catering firm. Now come along, what was it all about? Well, how did it look to you? Inexplicable, old man. That's why I'm asking you. Well, they say that the onlooker sees most of the game. Yes, well all I saw was you coming from the buffet with this waiter behind you, you knocked him over the balcony, all on one glass of champagne. Inexplicable, old man. Well, I suppose I shall have to make it up to the poor fellow. Ten pounds, do you think? I've asked you to explain, Charles, so that I can contradict these ugly rumours that are floating around. The other day, the waiter went round to the Club and met the Committee behind closed doors with his eye shut. - Yes, go on. Well, I can't bring myself to tell you. No, no, I can't, I can't. For heaven's sake, Jack. Well, you see, it appears... I only hope it's not true, for your sake and Monica's. Oh, well I'll, um... I'll see you, I have a couple of phone calls to make. I'll see you at the pub on the corner in 20 minutes. Hathaway, the Committee wish you to appear before them tomorrow at 6:45 to hear your explanation, if any. Look sir, just what exactly... Meanwhile, if you insist upon using the Club we can't of course prevent you. That's all. Oh, J... F. So, you come back, huh? - Hm? Still, you don't remember me, huh? Oh. - Si. Oh, wait a minute, I only just heard I knocked you over the balcony. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Let me go. Quiet, Peter. - Peter? Who are you? - It's the same again, he pretends again. Where you been, Peter? - Wales. Wales? - Oh, skip it. I tell you, there's some mistake, stop the car. Keep on! You still say you don't remember Sopranelli's, huh? Yes. - Like you say that night at the Club, like you knock me over the balcony? Help, help! Peter, think, do you want the police? What? - Do you? Don't 1? - You know, not me. Oh, where are we going? - To Lola, of course. Lola. - Aiee. Where is this? - This may be a shock for you, she has gone back. - Shock, back, what, where? Ladies and gentlemen. Do keep perfectly silent. Lola. Peter! Now you know where you are, huh? Bah' Mama, Papa, we've got him, Peter is here. Peter, my boy, you are back! Mama, mama. Mama, give him a chance, let him explain. He says he does not remember, not even me Papa. Peter, where have you been? Why did you go away? This you don't remember, huh? No? Peter, you must remember. Think of the customers, huh? I think you had better read this. To whom it may concern. I hereby certify that the bearer has been under my care suffering from... Or loss of memory. Loss of memory, Peter! - That is a trick! Signed J... Llewellyn. M.D. Pietro, is this true? - Nah, wait, you tell us when you lose it, huh? - And what were you doing at the Adelphi Club, huh? You never wrote to me, Pietro. And where you been, huh? - He don't remember mama, he do not remember, huh? That's right, you'd better ask the doctor. Lolly-olly M.D., can you not see he's a sick man, he needs rest. Josef, go get some grappa. Come Peter, Peter, come. Lola, Lola, come. Take your old place by Peter, here. Si, Papa. Like you used to... - Stromboli. Huh, on this right side. You take it, please. - Thank you, sir. Is it better, Peter, huh? - I'm sorry, it's naturally been a shock. - Sure, sure, you take your time before you tell us. I'm afraid you'll have to tell me, I... After you marry Lola, you live here very happy for one year my boy, and then one day you go out to buy paper... And you never come back. Not a word, you leave me and your job. Job, huh! - Mama is always against him, nothing Peter did was right. How could it be? He never did nothing. - Only sit around with his chianti and his "Sporting Life" growing fat on Lola's zabaglione. Zabaglione. - You remember, Pietro? It strikes a chord. - Stromboli. Lola! - Eh? What's wrong? - What's wrong? When did I go away? - A year and two months ago. 14 months. You are not a good man, in my opinion. You may possibly have something there. Lola, shall I tell Peter about it? Lola was broken hearted at first, but she's young and Mama tell her you never come back, and Sopranelli's are famous for show business, so she met Stromboli here. Of course, it's only professional name. Oh, I'm relieved to hear that. How do you do? I am now her dear friend, and artistic partner. You see Peter, Lola was brought up in the circus by Mama. It's in the blood. She had to do something in the long evenings. Stromboli, he train her and look after her like a brother. A bro... Brother... Well... But, Peter and Lola are man and wife. Now he has come back to her, she must come back to him, eh? No! - Never. He has something to hide. What? - He do not remember, he do not remember. - How true. Lola, you must decide. - Ah, that's right. All I ask is she picks the best man, namely, yours sincerely. Pietro, - Don't talk to him! Send him away. Take him back. Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me. If I have behaved badly, I beg your pardon. While having no recollection of it. Lola, please forgive me for behaving so disgustingly, though I can't remember how. The only decent thing to do is to return whence I came, if I could only remember where that was. Goodbye Lola. - Mama mia. Peter, Peter, why you go? Why do you tell her that? - It's the only thing to do. Oh, please Peter. - No, I'm sorry. If you leave her like this it'll be the worst thing you've done. At least go up and say a proper goodbye. For me, for me Peter. You were like son to me, huh? Go. Go. Well only for a moment then. Stromboli. How can he talk in front of all of you, get out, get out. Peter, you are in your rightful place now. Now, go, go. Lola. Lola... Lola. I don't know what to say, except I really am sorry. I don't remember, it's gone, so I don't know how much you may have to forgive. But from what I gather you're well rid of me, and... Goodbye. Pietro, why did you leave me? I can't imagine. Good heavens, what am I doing, forgive me Lola. What? - It's unspeakable of me. Better for you if you'd never met me. The least I can do is to clear out. Try to forget me, yes, do that, goodbye. Just like old times. This is definitely goodbye. Trunks, I want to call Wales. Number? - Cardiff, 87641. And your number? Gerrard 9801. Hello? Can I speak to Dr Llewellyn? I'm afraid he's not in. - What, you mean he hasn't arrived? - We're expecting him back. Yes, I know that, but... - Who is that? Mr Charles Hathaway, it's urgent. Can I take a message? - Yes, tell him that things have taken a serious turn for the worse. Where can he get you? - Gerrard 9801. Tell him to be careful. Tell him I'm trapped. Who you been talking to, huh? Uh, my medical advisor. - What for, where you go? I'm not going anywhere, I can't find my trousers. Well they've gone to be invisible mend. What am I supposed to wear? - I should care. Why do you knock? - Did 1? Oh. Someone sent my pants to be mended. That would be Papa. - What am I gonna wear? You don't have to go out. - Is this a trick to keep me here? - What? What is it Pietro? Aren't you glad to be back? - Of course I am Lola, you know that. - Really? You will find your clothes just as you left them when you went away. - Clothes! Oh, good, thank you. - Your beautiful check suit is still hanging inside. - Yes, yes. This one? Used to be mine? - Yes, it hasn't been touched. Oh, thanks. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say what I did just now. - You know something. You were wearing this the very first time I saw you. Oh. - Come here, Pietro. Look, you recognise that garage? No. It seems like only yesterday. I looked down and I saw this suit, with you inside of it, in a car like that. An old Bentley. Did I buy it? - You were not buying cars, Pietro, you were selling them. - Oh. How long did I work there? Maybe three months. - Three months, 14 months. You had just sold your yacht and come back from Monte Carlo. My yacht? - Because you had lost the fortune your uncle left you, at roulette Pietro. I see. You lost the whole lot on number seven. Wasn't that romantic? Yes, very. Who told you? - You did, Pietro. It was a wonderful story. - Yes, I'm sure it was. If you are a good boy, you can collect me after the circus, I shall tell Stromboli I finish this week. Ciao my Pietro, and don't worry, luckily, memory is not everything. Charing Cross Cloakroom, one trunk. One trunk. One trunk. One trunk. Yes, here it is. It's been here a long time. - Been abroad. Got the keys? - Yes. Why? - Comes in handy for unlocking it 'Ere Ted, give us a hand will you? 'Ere. Want a taxi sir? - Yes, please. Okay Ted. - Do you know a small, quiet hotel where I could go for a few hours? We'll ask the taxi driver, sir. Steady. - It'll do there. Thank you sir. Oh. D.S.0.,M.C... Africa Star. Well, that's better. That's very much better. Eton and Harrow? That's impossible. Bill darling. Have just gone round to the Waterburys for cocktails. Do come along the minute you get home. I've put a shirt out for you. Hurry poppet. Love dearest Bridget. Bridget. It must be coming back, I said, "Thank you Bridget". Oh no. The Old Malt House, Woodborough, Sussex Woodborough 240. Can I have Woodborough, Sussex 2407 Yes sir. - Thank you, I'll hold on. One moment. I'm ringing the number. - Thank you very much. Woodborough 240. - Hello? Is that Bridget? Yes, who's that? - Do you recognise my voice? Bill. Where are you? When did you get back? On, Bill, I thought I'd never see you again. After all this time, I thought you must be dead. Oh, I know it was a dangerous mission and you couldn't talk, but surely you could have sent a messenger? Mr Sopranelli? This is for you. - Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye Lola, please forgive me, Peitro. Madam. Got here as soon as I could, Charles, what is it? - Terrible news, Llewellyn. Did you get to the Club? Yes, I followed the trail all right. This is going to shake you Professor, to begin with... To begin with, I've found another wife. What, you too? - Do you mean you? I'm afraid so. - No. Well, practically. - What's yours called? Olwen, O-L-W-E-N, Olwen. From the window of the "South Wales Banner". Land owner's daughter to wed sportsman. The wedding was stated for the fifth, but the bridegroom never showed up. I think I can trump that. The one with the tropical touch seems to be the earlier. There's also a lady in Sussex signing herself Bridget, and addressing me as Bill. Yes, I make the score five to date. One near miss. - Well perhaps on should say near-Mrs. At last, I know what I was. A professional bigamist. An exploiter of women, a monster. Oh, Llewellyn, oh Llewellyn, let's have a drink. Same again. - I suppose I must have had a kink. - No. No moral sense perhaps, a complete parasite. A marked inability to foresee the consequences of your acts. Probably a pathological liar, but I wouldn't say a kink. Oh, good. - Deepest sympathy. Thank you, professor. If you care to come along to my clinic, I could try treatment by hypnosis at once. What, do you mean bring back my memory? Well the chances would be much better now. No, no. - Yes sir? Same again. - I have found out quite enough to go on with thank you. What are you going to do? I thought a lot about it in the train. I said to myself, I must make a clean start somewhere else. - Why not? Well then I thought, if I run away, I'm behaving like him, like the man I was, and this is something that I won't have at any price. - I can understand your reluctance. - So I made up my mind to do the only decent thing. I'm going to give myself up. No, no, Charles, we must talk this matter over. No, no, no, no, my mind is made up. I'm going to give myself up. - You are William Egorton? No, I'm going to take my punishment like a man. - Otherwise known as Peter Enford-Pewsoy? - No, no. I'm going to the nearest policeman. Or Charles Hathaway, perhaps? Yes? - We're police officers, sir. You were recognised by a constable outside Cardiff station. If you'll just come quietly with us, we'll charge you formally. - Charge? Charge? - Now wait a minute, this wants talking over, I was just discussing with the Professor. - That's right. You can make a statement later. Come along. - But you can't just rush me off without a word of warning, without giving me time to think. After all, I'm not the character you think I am. Not in any real sense. Professor! Hey, you can't do this, Llewellyn! Hello Charles. - Hello Professor. Sorry it had to come to this old man. This is my solicitor Mr Daniels, he's agreed to act for you. So this is the gentleman, remarkable. Good day. - How do you do. We have briefed eminent counsel who should be here at any moment for consultation. How can you possibly defend me? I married all five, didn't 1? Seven, stop press. Seven! - Pending a recount. But wait a minute, I haven't any money. Who's going to pay for a fully fledged barrister in a wig? Arrangements are being made old man. How are you Miss Chesterman, delighted to see you again. Good afternoon Daniels. - Your counsel. My... No! - ER? No women! - I beg your pardon? It's asking too much of me, I refuse to be defended by a woman. Your crime is a crime against women, and the fact that a woman is prepared to defend you will put in its proper perspective. Whether or not I shall be prepared to defend you however is another matter. This case is on the face of it peculiarly repellent. You say he claims to be suffering from loss of memory? Well I'm prepared to swear that it's perfectly genuine. Well in that case, you'd oblige me by retiring with Mr Daniels to prepare a rather more comprehensive proof of your evidence, Professor. Oh, very well. - Oh, with as little medical jargon as you can bring yourself to employ. Yes? - What? Did anybody knock. - No. Oh. Sit down, Egerton. Now then. You don't contest that you went through a form of marriage with these women? I'm afraid I'm not in a position to sir, uh... This case is a monument to the unutterable folly of womenkind. - I quite agree. For some strange reason, one after another appear to have found you irresistible. I know, ma'am. - It would be understandable if they'd been congenital idiots, but they appear to be quite normal people. Yes, ma'am. I can't speak for the late entries, of course. I should have thought it patently obvious that you were nothing more than a plausible rogue. Yes ma'am. - No special attraction or appeal. - None, whatsoever. I must say, I find it utterly mystifying. Utterly. One's mind boggles. - Mine boggles too. The encephalograph showed no abnormalities at all. Of course, it doesn't follow that they will cross-examine on that point. Ten past four, she's a long time. Poor Charles, I expect she's putting him through it. And that's just it, as I was saying. The judge only said what he did because I was a woman, and that's just what I mean, it's such a handicap in my job. You do understand that? - Oh, yes. I so desperately want to succeed on my own merits. Of course. - After all, it's a perfectly natural ambition. Your train, Miss Chesterman. - Oh, yes. My train. Oh, how kind, thank you. Have you formed any views, Miss Chesterman? Views? Oh yes, he'll plead not guilty, naturally. Naturally? - Naturally. I shall put forward a defence which is to my knowledge unprecedented in criminal jurisprudence. Seats for the big trial, seats for the big trial. Get your seats for the big trial. Only a few stools left for the trial, ladies. Seats for the big trial, ladies. Seats for the big trial. Get your stools for the big trial, ladies. Stools for the big trial ladies. Put up William Egerton. Silence! William Egerton, you stand charged on indictment that on the third day of November, 1948 at Winchester in the county of Hampshire, being at the time validly married, you did knowingly enter into a marriage with one Anne Pargitor. And subsequently, on the 6th day of June, 1949, at St Albans in the county of Hertfordshire did knowingly enter into a marriage with one Joanna Mary Brewer. Witnesses wait here please. And subsequently, on the 19th day of April 1954 at Hampstead in the county of London, did knowingly enter into a marriage with one Monica Hendricks. William Egerton, how say you? Are you guilty or not guilty? Not guilty. I shall show that in August 1946 the accused married his first and only legitimate wife. Isobel May Hawkshaw, in Darejeeling, India. With or without the e, Mr Fortescue? Hawkshaw or Darjeeling? - Hawkshaw. Without, my lord. In Darjeeling... - Thank you. Thank you. In Darjeeling, India, where she is still living. Although some five months ago, she obtained a divorce from her husband on the grounds of desertion she remained his valid wife during the period of these offences. I shall show that on his return to England, the accused systematically inveigled no less than six other ladies into bigamous marriages. Letters A to G in the particulars, My Lord. My lord, it may save my friend time if I say that the defence accepts that these marriages did in fact take place. A,B,C,D,E, F, G, the lot? The lot, My Lord. - Very well. I thank my friend. Members of the jury, I shall show how the accused exploited his female victims one after the other, and indeed, in some cases, simultaneously, displaying a quite exceptional appetite for matrimony at which we can only marvel. There is no suggestion that he has embraced any polygamous faith. He seems simply to have embarked on this method of livelihood in preference to any other. Strip these events of any false glamour that they mas possess, and what are we left with? The seedy swindles of a practised adventurer. A shabby series of frauds by a cheap trickster. The dingy exploits of a shopworn cavalier. Hear, hear. When were you? - 1948. Oh, I should have thought it was earlier. Miss Pargiter. I see. The expectations you had under your uncle's will came to nothing? Nothing at all. - Whereupon the accused abruptly vanished from your life? That's right. On the following Monday, as a matter of fact. Thank you, Miss Pargiter. Now Miss Pargiter, I only want to ask you one question. If the opportunity offered itself, would you take the accused back again? Oh yes. Definitely. I only want to ask you one question, Miss Brewer. Would you take the accused back again? Yes, I would. I hate him, that is how I feel. I hate him! - But would you take him back? But of course, naturally. Would you take him back Miss Popham? Oh yes. Would you, Mrs Hendricks? - I oughtn't to. Please answer my question. Silence, silence! This seems to be a convenient moment to adjourn for lunch. You sent for me? - Yes, I want to ask you a straight question, and this time, I want a straight answer. Who's paying for my defence? My wives, isn't it? - What makes you think that? Well, who else could it be? If the ladies wish to subscribe to what they feel is a deserving cause. This is really too bad, if I'd known about this before I'd never have agreed to appear in court. I've taken their money once, and now I'm unwittingly doing the same again. The same again, my dear sir, is every woman's ideal, they're gluttons for punishment. I refuse to be defended at their expense. And anyway, they frighten me to death. Oh don't be absurd. I've worked day and night to get up this case and developed a unique defence, and in my view you're innocent. Really? - Well, naturally. Nauseating, revolting, but technically innocent. You very properly pleaded not guilty, and I intend to carry out my brief. It appears that you have no choice. Sent in by Mrs Monica. Monica? - With her best wishes. Tell her it's very sweet of her, but I really don't deserve it. Okay, Willy boy. - Charlie boy if you don't mind. Oh, no. From Mrs Lola, sir. From Mrs Bridget. Well, here's to more trials of this description. - That's right. Have a pull. - Do you think he'll get off? Take a miracle. - Ah. After you with the vino. It is my contention, members of the jury, that apart from a purely coincidental resemblance, this man is a totally different person from the author of these crimes. I shall show you that he underwent a loss of memory. You will hear how he awakened in Wales without the slightest recollection of who, where, and above all, what he was. As soon as he heard of the nature of his past, he was overcome by horror and disgust. You will hear an eminent doctor tell you of the type of person he knows the accused to be. I'm sorry to interrupt you again Miss Chesterman, but are you saying that this man has undergone such a change as not to be liable for the crimes previously committed by whomsoever he was when he committed them? Your Lordship puts it with your customary clarity. You're not saying are you that the police have got hold of the wrong man, and that there is another man who did it? Oh no My Lord, this is the physical shape of the man who did it. - Then, how do you intend to prove that he differs from the culprit? He is a different man, My Lord. A moment ago, you said he was the same man. No, My Lord, I said he had the same physical properties. But only just now you said he was a different man. Yes, My Lord. My point is that the physical man is not the mental man. Are you saying he's unfit to plead? Or are you invoking the McNaughton rules? Oh no, My Lord. He is perfectly sane now, but I can't speak as to whether or not he was insane at the time, as the mind that we may now inspect is not the mind that was his at the time, when it is necessary to consider the state of his mind. I remain hopelessly adrift. What does it matter to us what the state of his mind is at the present moment? Very simply, My Lord, I submit that it is quite impossible to know whether or not the present mind is guilty as the mind that might have been guilty at the time when it was important to know whether the mind was guilty, is not the mind that is now before us. - I see, very well. You'll have to prove whatever it is you're going to prove, and then we can see what it looks after you've proved it. As Your Lordship pleases. Members of the jury, I would ask you to listen carefully to every word that is given in evidence, and I am convinced that you will arrive at the unshakeable conclusion that the mind within the frame now sitting in that dock is not the mind of the scoundrel who committed these crimes. You are William Egerton? - So I am informed. You are not yourself aware of it? I don't remember anything about myself before September the fifth, last. You have heard Professor Llewellyn's evidence. Is it true that you would not allow him to treat you? It is. - Why? I refused to be identified with this man as soon as I discovered what sort of person he was. He? - William Egerton, My Lord. But that's you. - No, My Lord. My Lord, the accused feels that he has no mental connection with... - Either he is William Egerton, or he is not. In fact, he admits he is. - Was, My Lord. Well, whoever you feel you are, don't keep saying he when you mean I. I don't mean I, My Lord. - You must not argue with me. It would be less confusing if you said I when you mean him, as well as of course I when you refer to you, as His Lordship directs. Now look at these unfortunate women. Can you imagine yourself, as you are today, embarking on the same course with all, or any one of them? - Certainly not. Will you tell the jury what your feelings were when you discovered the sort of man William Egerton was? - I was absolutely horrified. Face the jury. - I was absolutely horrified. I'd no reason to assume that I was anything other than a decent citizen. When I heard what this brutal, blackguard was up to. - Nobody has said he was actually brutal. - Who my lord? This other man, William Egerton. Now I'm doing it. Please, My Lord, you mustn't whitewash him, he was rotten through and through. Oh no! - Not through and through. Oh no. - Silence! This court is not a beer garden, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. If there's any further disturbance I shall order the court to be cleared. Members of the jury, I do not ask you to bring in a verdict that is other than in accordance with the evidence, but I implore you to ask yourselves can it possibly be just that Dr Jekyll should be punished for the sins of Mr Hyde. Is this man to be set free to face the world again, to start afresh on a new unblemished page of his life, to walk again in the streets, to breathe the same air as his fellow creatures, free from a forgotten past in which he feels himself to have had no part whatsoever. Or is he, for misdeeds which he cannot remember, and with which he feels himself to have no affinity to be shut away, utterly, cut off from the world, caged in the solitude and silence of a prison cell, remote from the highways and byways of humanity. That is the choice that lies before you. And it is my contention, members of the jury, that... Miss Chesterman. - Ah. If Your Lordship will permit me. Yes? But you can't. You can't possibly do a thing like that. What is going on Miss Chesterman? Well if Your Lordship doesn't mind, I'd like to plead guilty now. Silence, silence. Do you understand what you're saying? No, of course he doesn't My Lord. I want to plead guilty. Let me put the issue simply before you. The question really is whether you now say you now believe you were, when you committed the crime, the man you were before you became the man you say you are now. Is that quite clear? - Perfectly clear, My Lord. But what's the matter, why have you changed your mind? What do you want? - Solitude and silence. But you're innocent! - I insist that I'm guilty, and I won't be talked out of it. I should never forgive myself if I were innocent. Charles. - Pietro Bill, no. - You can't. May I talk to the prisoner below? No, I want to go to prison. I want to be utterly cut off from the highways and byways of humanity at the earliest possible moment. Your Lordship will appreciate that the considerations of a most recondite juridical character must be utterly beyond the comprehension of the lay defendant. My retainer entitles me, My Lord, you must stop him, it's wicked, it's utterly unfair, it's criminal. You beast! Clear the court, clear the court. Clear the court. Charles. Charles! Charles! - Pietro! Bill! Verona, no. - Roland! Pietro! You'd better wait, we'll try the side door. Okay. Good luck. - Thanks. Egerton. Egerton.
