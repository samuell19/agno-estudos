Shakespeare said "Time will pierce the gorgeous delicate youth would parallel lines engraved beauty brow, eat rare treasures, natural beauty, what can not escape his sweep of the scythe." Adapted from the Jing M, Guo's best selling novel Tiny Times 1.0 Folded Paper Time Hurry up, Ruby! I'm trying! I stood up in the middle of my business! Lily, are you sure the moves you've choreographed are okay? I feel so weird about it Of course they're okay, I've been reading Fashion Magazines since middle school My choreography is absolutely the most fashion And now, a female quartet group of High School Seniors, the "Generation Sisters" Presenting the song《Auld Lang Syne》 Of course, mine Me... We used to wander all day long On the mountain of hometown We used to suffer poverty in life Striving for living everywhere Friendship hits the spot Love between friends Cheers for life long Sing together for our everlasting friendship Sing for our everlasting friendship Don't misunderstand, this isn't me. I'm not this pretty This is my friend Nan Xiang, she majors in painting and sculpture She has an artistic flair and glamorous skin Talented and beautiful, she's my ideal model She likes to paint beautiful sceneries And she's also a beautiful scenery in the eyes of many men Her family isn't very wealthy But art school is a place that burns money like an incinerator Okay, this is not me either I'm not that luxurious. This is my friend Lily As you can see, she is a bona-fide second generation of the wealthy If I hadn't known her for more than a decade I would be just like everybody else can't help but want to throw xiao long bao at her face Actually, I've done that before She doesn't only have luxury on her mind, however She double majors in Accounting and International Finance And even self-taught business, and reaped profits in her spare time She used to dabble in Gold sales Recently she's involved in the International market for potatoes and corn Of course, this would not be me at all Get out of bed! She is my good friend, Ruby Tang She's a Secondary Badminton Athlete at the National level But her dream is To become a sex icon like Marilyn Monroe As you can see She's someone who is especially calm in situations where one wouldn't be calm And not calm in situations where one should be calm… That kind of girl Okay, this is me Not as pretty as Nan Xiang, not as refined as Lily And not as OVER as Ruby My name is Lin Xiao, the most ordinary of the hundreds of thousands of Shanghainese girls But our story is not so ordinary Are you ready for it? Lin Xiao, remember to bring the milk Okay, okay Why don't you drive today Sure That's not the point I don't want to argue over a trivial RMB 24 The point is, your magazine《Monthly Times》 is completely wrong in the way fees and tax deductions are being handled You don't understand what I mean, I don't need this RMB 24 But rather, an attitude, a professional attitude If you insist on this attitude, then I apologize This will be the last time I write for you Hello! Hello, where are you? Central Plaza Are Nan Xiang and Ruby there yet? Oh, I will be there as soon as possible So I got a crazy call this early morning It made me so mad! Tell you when I see you You would expect more from a financial magazine But not only did they make mistakes in their tax calculations,they wouldn't admit their mistake This is as nonsensical as if a pet magazine has an article on how to braise dog meat! Bonjour Bonjour 《Monthly Comes》 Lily, school's started, what are you doing Reading a pornography magazine, you, you! Hey, Ru Ru, take a closer look 《Monthly Times》 With my literary level, it's really hard to accept That they put "time" with "month" "monthly time" is like a "period" Lily, if you take a magazine like this To an athlete student who hasn't taken a culture course since middle school Then that's your fault Lin Xiao This is Jian Xi and Gu Yuan Lily and my boyfriends They've been close since high school Two pieces of a puzzle For two such perfect people to appear together Is too much stimulant for any young girl to handle Throughout our high school years Lily, Nan Xiang, Ruby and I The four of us, along with the girls of the entire school, used them as blueprint In sketches, paintings, designed, romanticized Countless fan fiction stories of sentiments This long-lasting group fantasy Was ultimately killed off by me and Lily And we drew an end to it all Since high school, Lily and I became their treasures But we also became an eyesore to all the girls within the school The four of us are boisterous Loving, chatty You got here so late Till now We're all done with registration I just went to shop for shoes You're ridiculous, Nobody goes shopping for shoes so early in the morning on the first day of school! What You buy two meat buns every morning, have I ever said anything about that? Ah… What? What happened, did you win the lottery? Lin Xiao, there are a lot of fraud organizations lately I got an interview with《M.E》 It's this afternoon, haha… What's《M.E》? 《M.E》is a publication that's almost holy to us art students Don't be too happy yet, I'd suggest you confirm first These days, fraud groups like to target two kinds of people One is senior citizens And the other would be brainless and physically endowed college students like you Do fraud organizations have such good taste? See the paper is in good quality! Speaking of taste, do you really plan to go to the interview in these tennis shoes?

I want to eat lychee Where am I going to get you lychee in October? On the tree! I really don't know what excuses Zhou Chong Guang would use In the future to delay his drafts and make me suffer Stop thinking about it now Get drunk if there's wine, if homeless, streets are fine Isn't there a song… "I slept on the side of the road all day" What's the next line again? "Uncle held the money and nodded my way" "I said to uncle" "uncle, good day" Did you start doing business on the roadside Lily Lin Xiao! I was frightened Shh Lily, don't… I'm here for Nan Xiang, what does it have to do with you! You thought I'm here for you Get over yourself! Stop scolding Lily! Lily You guys just go first, I… Why are you involved with this scum, are you out of your mind! From middle school until now, haven't you suffered enough? This has nothing to do with you You're more worked up than I am Is that necessary? No It's especially unnecessary! Dumped three times, slapped four times I'm not the one who was beaten, who had to go to hospital for severe injuries, and kicked out of the house! Nan Xiang, if he drives you to your grave one day I'm not responsible for your remains! Seems a bit cold Throw it away if you don't want to eat Xi Cheng From now on, don't come for me anymore I don't want to see you anymore The Nan Xiang I knew Had given the most wonderful time of her youth To this person who's hurt her the most She once told me That feeling is like Cropping the best segment From the her own cloth of life And to sew it in another's life with her own hands Numerous firsts of her youth First time holding hands First embrace First kiss First time running away from home… These things all overlapped with the tracks of Xi Cheng's life I'm not as furious as Lily On the contrary, I feel the utmost empathy for Nan Xiang That night Nan Xiang finally chose to cut away this segment of a love that has been buried deep in her bone and blood I understand her reluctance and pain And understand all her pain is from love From then on Nan Xiang has never mentioned Xi Cheng again It seems that everybody's lives has gone upon the right and stable tracks So talented Come here, Gu Yuan Let me introduce you, this is my son, Gu Yuan This young man is talented and handsome Gu Yuan, this is Yuan Yi Come, sit, you all should sit Does your daughter have a boyfriend? Not yet It's only right to find a good person My son doesn't have a girlfriend Really?

There wasn't one It doesn't matter anyway Mr... Mr. Gong, do you mean to say… I don't need to compensate for the loss? Just make up a receipt Then I'll be leaving now, Mr. Gong… Wait It was going to be a gift But now there's no need Take it if you like This is my first time seeing Gong Ming away from brand-named suits and luxury cars First time seeing Gong Ming so unlike his usual self It's as if I had a glimpse at the vast but lonely sky Through a small window This person Is apart from the regular egotistic shell that can summon storms All that's left is a gentle heart Just like the lone light in his window at the moment A distant and lonely planet In the silent universe In the endless darkness Softly shining without a word Should I say it… Hello Isn't it because Yuan Yi's car broke down And it's dangerous for a girl to go home in the middle of the night So it should be no problem for you to let her sleep on a bed in your room Then why can't the bed just be set up in the living room? How rude To let the guest sleep in the living room! Then I'll sleep in the living room She's not freaked out, you're a big man Why are you freaked out? She'd better not freak out I'm going to take a shower Let me remind you something You should stop shopping that much from now on I know You've already deactivated my credit card But don't worry I won't starve to death Hello Where's Gu Yuan? He's taking a shower Who are you? Enough? Don't you have classes this morning? Don't feel well Don't want to go Lin Xiao What's the matter with you? Pick up the phone Hello It's Jian Xi He's looking for you Hello Nan Xiang, I have to tell you something Tell me later Nan Xiang Lin Xiao I can't believe… I can't believe you didn't fix my face slimmer! Ah… If you are overseeing our university in God's perspective or somewhere up high Then you will see A brilliant game of cat and mouse There are thousands of possibilities in life The end can be completely different depending on who meets whom first God has thrown a handful of balls onto the roulette Before the roulette stops Nobody knows who the final winner would be Nan Xiang Where are you? How can you treat me like this! Lin Xiao, how can you! Lin Xiao You Lin Xiao, okay that's it, have you gone nuts! Lin Xiao, don't go… Nan Xiang, tell her, tell her! Lin Xiao If I were your boyfriend, I'd swing my arms at you and give you two slaps! You should have hit him! Who knows which woman he slept with yesterday! I didn't Jian Xi didn't sleep with other women It's Gu Yuan So you are saying... Jian Xi... The one who slept with Jian Xi was Gu Yuan? Okay... you mean ... Gu Yuan is the one sleeping with other women? Oh, You're all here What are you talking about What's the situation Nerves wrecked I think she just wanted to leave the crime scene as quickly as possible Lily, I have something to tell you Jian Xi only knew after that girl picked up the phone that he left at Gu Yuan's place Lily, you should have a talk with Gu Yuan I have something to tell you The school specifies no vehicles within dormitory area, why did you drive in here You can't, but I can Because we're different Your words are... Mom Did you understand what I just said Don't see Gu Yuan anymore Our family is not open to the lowly poor like you You'd better take a good look at your own worth Before you make friends or do things with people Then you should take a look at your son's worth first Hmph How insolent! Mom My son doesn't seem to have skipped out on spending money on you Your son has bought nothing that I'm wearing right now In fact, I bought the boots your son's wearing How can such an educated woman Sound so much like... A middle-aged woman like my mom Don't be mad anymore I like you It's not because you've had a driver since you were little It's not because you have brand-named bags And it's definitely not because you gave me expensive boots Even if you don't have a cent I will still like you Don't be childish! Be mature! You really think these things aren't worth anything Let me tell you Love without materialism is just a pile of sand Even without the flowing wind It will spill after a couple of steps If I were a poor student Would you, Gu Yuan, still like me!? Of course I would! If I'm a poor guy today Would you still like me!? Would you!? I understand now You don't understand The reason you can nonchalantly state "money isn't important" "If I had no money would you still love me" these bold words Is that you've never lived without money You bring around four-hundred-thousand dollars' worth of credit Racking up receipts on POS machines without a worry Just for a pretty watch, a pretty shirt You used a noble manner to play a slovenly aristocrat Stop this pretense of self-satisfaction You've read too much Shakespeare! Have it back! Have it all back! For so many years Lily and Gu Yuan are always arguing in every way As if at any time a bomb could be set off to blow both of them up But in the next moment, they've made up as if nothing's happened I thought this time would be the same But... These… are all that you've given to Gu Yuan in the past What's the matter You're spacing out Nothing, Mr. Gong By the way I need you to run an errand for me I thought it would be like before Just to buy some coffee or deliver a document I never would have thought That Gong Ming had given me The entire program for the New Shanghai Fashion Design Competition Organized by《M.E》 And the organizer was my university The representative from my school is waiting for me at the meeting room, at this moment The moment I opened the doors I'd understood The reason for Gong Ming to give me this job It's not because I am more capable than Kitty But because... Hello, I'm the representative this time... for《M.E》 Tell me How much wine did you have the Principal to drink Why did he give someone majoring in Accounting and International Finance to take full charge in this fashion event Are all those Professional Clothing Design people cultivating hybrid rice now What's wrong with International Finance Which eye on your body could tell I don't understand fashion I only have two eyes on me, and... and Is there anyone in Fashion Design that could talk about budget with you They can only chuckle and say, don't talk to me about money, shallow Art is priceless Priceless? Come on When they see rich collectors or famous CEOs They can't help wanting to put a bar code on their forehead Do you think the school has given a logical budget This budget is only enough for a folk dance in Tieling That's why we came to Pudong for a venue I sacrificed so much You know that I get allergic when I leave the inner city And roaming charges are so expensive in Pudong The signal is terrible… I have to say, there is always a cement smell in Pudong Lin Xiao, do you think this is just an accident Or are the people in Pudong intentionally breaking me Lily, don't think too much… Obviously somebody is trying to hit you You truly want to build the stage by the waterfront, and have models walk down from the ship For safety, I'd suggest to build an indoor stage Mr. Gong has approved an outdoor stage And it's rare for me to see him smile That's rarer than a Halley's Comet You might not even see it every 76 years Okay, fine Let's discuss the seating… The seating has been modified seventeen times Do you need to add anything to the VIP list? I'll confirm with you one last time If you change it again, I'm going to pull your intestines out and tie a bow with it One more thing Your... Hair is a little too messy You are back Lin Xiao I have something to tell you Did Xi Cheng come for you again No, it's about the Fashion Show this time I want to ask you a favor But I don't want to mix money with our friendship Come on, Nan Xiang Haven't we always mixed money and friendship Remember, during high school Lily and I took your pictures and sold them to acne-faced upper class boys for ten dollars each Also, there was a time when both of us Sold Lily's term paper online And bought a solar hot water dispenser with the profit, remember? Okay Aren't you and Lily responsible for this Fashion Show Design Competition? I would like you to help, could you let me join the competition? But this competition is for students major in Professional Clothing Design You only have that course as an elective, would you be able to join? I know, that's why I wanted to see if you could do anything Oh wait Isn't Gu Yuan's mother a special judge this time We can ask her for help If Lily finds out, she'll kill you, won't she She will You two are standard nepotistic What are you doing here, Grandma Rong What do you know I am the Princess Did Lin Xiao really do that Of course, she hurried out the door early this morning She's a hen, and still turned herself in to a weasel Lin Xiao is a hen? Lin Xiao, is this really okay Thank you so much I'm in Thank you, Lin Xiao Really? but Ye Zhuan Ping already refused me Why? Because your brain was squashed by the door If it wasn't me You two would be huddled and crying You ask Ye Zhuan Ping for help, that's not helping her You're looking down upon yourself, and insulting me as well Lily, don't be mad Lin Xiao and I just didn't want to trouble you So we decided on our own Lily, thank you But how did you do it? I asked the in-charge professor , Professor Sun Reasoning by truth and touching by heart, done Really, Lily, you're too eloquent Of course On this 9.6 million square kilometer land Everybody knows about Lily's silver-tongued Plus, professor Sun is my uncle So, in the end I couldn't do anything and relied on Lily It's because you can't accomplish anything Your innocent attempts are what make you cute A superwoman like Lily Might not attract boys anyway You think I can't accomplish anything either, huh That's not what I mean That's what you mean, you're laughing Lin Xiao You still have to go to work, I should stop bothering you Am I cute for not being able to do anything? This is the "Lin Xiao" that Jian Xi likes? Do I like myself like this? What a pretty piece of clothing I've never worn such pretty clothing I'll make it for you Even if you make it for me I wouldn't have an occasion to wear it I'm predicting that I'll be Wearing training clothes all my life As the Fashion Show drew near, Christmas came Christmas every year is the most beautiful time in Shanghai The entire Shanghai shimmers as if covered by golden specks Traditionally, during Christmas Lily and I would be busy preparing presents for our boyfriends This year, however, we have a same new goal It's all arranged, take a look, any problem Not bad A little better than Lucy Pretty good Pretty good, good Li How about this angle, what about that Okay, don't talk, don't talk Did you get a clear shot Aye, okay Close up Just now, take a look, take a look, the last one Okay You, talk, Lily, is this you So early in the morning, were you beaten It's the New Year, who lacks this much integrity Did you call the police yet Okay, well, that's useless anyway meanness and bitterness is an integrity issue The police can't arrest her Lily, don't tell me you can't tell that Ruby put make-up on Don't joke around Seriously When did you get a sugar daddy Sugar daddy A sugar daddy would pick me over others That's true, you look like the seductive type Okay, stop digging yourselves into holes Today is Christmas Eve In the past we would spend it with boyfriends, this year...
