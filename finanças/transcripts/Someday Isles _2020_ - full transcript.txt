Oh my God, I just had this crazy dream. But it was like the craziest thing in the world. Like I almost killed this lady but it's like I was the lady at the same time, like I almost killed myself. But I was also the bum in the street asking for money. Oh my God- - What do you think of this watch? I was thinking about it and I feel like if I had a real man's watch on my wrist when I walk into these meetings, I'd probably get a little bit more respect. Are you serious right now? I'm trying to tell you about this dream I had, like it means something. Babe, it's a bad dream. It's not even real. None of that stuff actually happened. You're sitting here talking about a watch right now. You don't like it? It'll look good on you, babe. You think so? Yeah, it'll look great. Can we get it? Can we go shopping today finally please? Okay, yeah, but listen don't do this, like you know I have to go to the studio. Are you fucking serious? - I have to finish this album - Today? Today? You promised. Last week, I said, can we please spend some time together? You said, tomorrow. The next day I asked you, are we gonna go to lunch today? You said, tomorrow, we'll go to the mall. Then, I ask you can we go to the mall? It's next week. I just woke up. I'm tripping because I want to spend time with you? Yeah, you woke up, I've been sitting here waiting for you to wake up so we could get our day started and the first thing you say is all this stuff about this crazy stupid dream you had. You didn't even say good morning. Are you serious right now? - Every morning- - Yeah, I'm fucking serious. I have been trying to spend time with you for weeks. It's like I'm not even a priority, like I'm not even a thought in your fucking mind. Yeah, obviously because it seems like the studio is more sexier than me, the studio is way more important. Stacy, seriously? Yeah, I'm very serious. You know what? I'm over it. I'm just gonna go to the mall by myself. You do this rant and I can't even focus when I get into the studio. Yeah, focus on me for once. How 'bout that? - Yo, let's just- - You're always in the studio. - Yo, calm down. - You live there. Get the fuck out of here. Go ahead, make your stupid album. Just give me your card and I'm gonna go by myself. Are you serious? Yeah, it's better that way. You're not gonna slow me down, I'm not gonna be a distraction.

If our investors saw this... Ling Fei's still young. This video means nothing. I've known her since she was very little, I know her very well. She has what it takes to run the family business well. And to become an excellent leader. Mr. Ling, please give Ling Fei some time. She will discover her strengths. Maybe, while I'm in America next week I'll talk to her. I believe she has what it takes. KK, you don't have to worry. We will handle it on our own. OK, let us handle this on our own. You can go now. All right. Mr. Ling? Cigar? It's time for dinner. I'm already rich! Mr. Ling? You say no to everything I say. Should I just quit? Good suggestion! Remember what you said. - Get out. - Then I'll go. Why would you fire Doit? I'm rich! I can hire anyone, anytime! Money can't solve everything. You should spend more time with your family. I work for my family. I work this hard and earn so much money just to raise her. She can have whatever she wants! Are you blind? KK is trying to take over our company! Don't you know how to take care of your daughter? Okay! I know, but I've sent someone to secretly look after her. I'm too busy with my company. And why does she act so badly? Because you don't make time for the family. You only care about the business. I can only do so much myself! You have the responsibility, you are the father! From now on, you will pay more attention to her! Call her tomorrow! Relax, relax! Okay! I will compromise, my dear, I'll follow your advice. I'll talk to her tomorrow. Let's go to bed.

Well, I mean, I'm working on it. It's just Stacey man, she's like... It's like, look, in the beginning she was really supportive. That's why I fell in love with her, Right? Right. And I'm just trying to be honest with you, Alex. I mean, it's like, that's what... The music was the reason she fell in love with me, it's the reason I fell in love with her. She was supporting me. And now I feel like it's this... This is the reason why she hates me. PA, stop being such a little bitch. Success demands everything you got 24/7, 365. Once you achieve it, it's fucking amazing. It's powerful and it's addictive. But you know what, not everyone's meant for success. And I'm not convinced you are right now. To attain it, you're gonna have to shed all this fucking bullshit, the distractions, the phone calls, everything. You need to be fucking you. Okay. You need to figure out the path you want to get on, is going to be a path of success, or failure? You know what, Alex? I think I needed to hear that man. I appreciate that. I think I really needed to hear that. You need to make this happen. I got you. I got you. Listen, don't worry. I'm going to take care of the album. It's going to be done in a week. I promise you.

Stay safe! Okay. Pay attention. No problem. Let me show you around my village. This place is beautiful. I can't believe this is all yours Give me a second, let me take this, hello! PA, where the fuck are you? - Hey Alex? - I can't believe you, I have been trying to reach you man. This is bullshit. I was just about to call you man. About to call me, I have got everybody looking for you everywhere and no one can find you. Hell you haven't even called me in a week. I'm in China. What, can you say that again. You are where? China, China can you hear me? China, what the fuck are you doing in China? I mean I told you to let go of everything that was holding you back, but literally, leaving the entire country was the last thing I expected. We got an album to do. I know, I know trust me I know. PA! What? Turn to your right. This fucking guy. What are you talking about? Look, I'm here. Are you serious? What the fuck, it's the ghost of Gwendolyn Come over here. Are you serious? I'm very serious. What are you doing here? What's up my ninja. I'm all right. I came half the world to see you. All right, any place you go, don't forget I'm going to track you down. This temple, rice fields, caves, strip clubs. Anywhere. I'm sorry about this. Sorry about what? Who is this little tasty spring roll? Come on man. What do you mean? This is Ling Fei, Ling Fei I'm sorry. This is the ghost of Gwendolyn Ling Fei, pleasure to meet you. Oh, boy. Ling Fei, how do you know PA? I'm just showing him around. I own this whole place right here. - Really? - Yeah. Congratulations to you. What are you doing with this tortured soul? Come on, man. You know where I am. I'm in Guilin. I flew halfway around the world to see you, because I care about you and our album. And if this brings you the inspiration you need to get this album done. I'm totally for it here. To deal look at me. This is what we're gonna do. I've got business here with you. And I need you back in LA in 48 hours. 48 hours. 48 hours. Have you ever heard me sing PA? No, no. Think about it. Have you ever heard me sing anything? No. If I don't see you in LA, I'm going to cut the fucking track myself and finish the album. - All right. - You got it? - Yes, yes. - We're clear. Yes. All right. I got to take some calls. I'll see you in LA in 48. Pleasure to meet you. Drop the spring roll. Come on man. Can you believe this guy? Listen, get rid of that... Whatever that is that is on your head. Know what, the deal is. I dropped the hat. You dropped the girl, and we finished the album. I'm sorry. Anyways, this place is absolutely amazing. I mean, really amazing. Yeah, I had forgotten the beauty of my home. I don't want to leave again. It's like I'm in a dream. It's crazy that you even mentioned that. Like, I had this dream a while ago, and I was driving through the streets of Hong Kong. But I was also the passenger in the backseat, and the beggar on the side of the road. I had no idea what it meant until now. You see in the dream, I didn't know who I was. I had no control over anything. And now, I realize that it was me in real life. I didn't know if I was PA the boyfriend, or PA the artists, or just some kid from Miami, who got lucky and made it big in Los Angeles. You what is crazy, I recently saw a kid get shot outside of a record store. And I remember thinking how easily could have been me. You see, my music career was suffering. I had the hardest time writing songs, and I blamed Stacy constantly, but it was my responsibility. Even Alex, as smart as ghost of Gwendolyn tried to help, even though, I think he was interested in making money more than anything else, he was there for me. I guess I was hoping that one day, someday things would change. I guess I was stuck in Someday Isles. And then I saw you at the train station, and I knew you were in trouble. And I had to take action. Not because anyone told me to, but because it was the right thing to do. And in that moment, I was just me. I was peaceful. I was calm. I felt like I was in control. Now I know that it's up to me to make things happen. To come out of that Someday Isle, to look inside of myself and to take responsibility. I'm going to take everything that I've learned, and put into my whole album. You see for me, music is everything. Our journey has helped us, both of us, to discover who we truly are. I mean, I forgotten my soul. I, my parents have been so hard on me. They're so demanding. But they also gave me everything that I have. Even so I felt like I was missing out on so much, like my friends would be out while I was studying. That's why I love dancing. I can have fun and still get good grades. When I was very young, maybe five. I remember my father and I looking out of all these rice paddies. We had nothing. My father worked until he owned every acre of land. He wanted us to have everything, he wanted us, my sister and I to work hard to so we can always support ourselves. I never knew there were people out there, so eager to take this thing away. It goes so far to kidnapped me. Now I understand why they were so protective. I'm going to work hard. I'm going to take over my family business and continue the legacy and no my own, and hey, maybe I'll build a dance studio in my office. Hey, you and I have been through so much, in such a brief space. You saved my life. I know it's a bit strange to say this, but I think closer to you than I have anyone before, would you consider staying here with my family. Are you serious? Yes. Oh my God. Are you serious? Yes. Look, the offers incredibly tempting. But you know I got the ghost of Gwendolyn up my ass right. Look, this experience was more than I could have ever anticipated. My time with you is both more challenging, and incredible at the same time. I've learned that I have my own purpose and my destiny back home. I was hoping you were gonna say otherwise. But I understand. It's okay. I could not have found my balance without you. And I couldn't have realized my destiny without you. ♪ It doesn't matter really where you come from ♪ ♪ I came from the gutter too ♪ ♪ Yeah I'm from the hood too ♪ ♪ Just like you ♪ ♪ I didn't go to college ♪ ♪ Went through problems ♪ ♪ Had my own struggles too ♪ ♪ Just like you ♪ ♪ I want it all ♪ ♪ I wanted this shit ♪ ♪ I think that lived to die for it ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah ♪ ♪ I looked my mother in her eyes told her we made it ♪ ♪ Told my brothers ♪ ♪ Called up Steven ♪ ♪ Gotta keep going ♪ ♪ They watchin' me ♪ ♪ All it takes is you, you, you ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Tuh ♪ ♪ It all belongs to you {Yeah} ♪ ♪ And if I die ♪ ♪ All I did it was for you ♪ ♪ {Yeah} It belongs to you ♪ ♪ {Yeah} It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Cause its up to you ♪ ♪ Every boy has a dream to come into ♪ ♪ A man he always dreamed of ♪ ♪ One of these days ♪ ♪ We're the change ♪ ♪ We're the gold ♪ ♪ Hollow and need to grow ♪ ♪ All my children need to know ♪ ♪ Be the light and let it glow ♪ ♪ Be strong ♪ ♪ We're the change for the globe ♪ ♪ Hollow and need to grow ♪ ♪ All my children need to know ♪ ♪ We're the change ♪ ♪ We're the gold ♪ ♪ So it doesn't matter really where you come from ♪ ♪ I came from the gutter too ♪ ♪ Yeah I'm from the hood too ♪ ♪ Just like you ♪ ♪ I didn't go to college ♪ ♪ Went through problems ♪ ♪ Had my own struggles too ♪ ♪ Just like you ♪ ♪ All it takes is you you, you, you ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Tuh ♪ ♪ It all belongs to you ♪ ♪ And if I die ♪ ♪ All I did it was for you ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ It belongs to you ♪ ♪ Cause its up to you ♪ ♪ Every boy has a dream to come into ♪ ♪ A man he always dreamed of ♪ ♪ One of these days ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ And I don't want you to go through ♪ ♪ What happened to me ♪ ♪ So, I just want to share my story ♪ I look into your eyes for the sun rise, stare into the...
