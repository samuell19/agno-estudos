A BYEOKDOL FILMS PRODUCTION PRESENTED BY KT&G SANGSANGMADANG PRODUCER / JAMES DO DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY / GANG DAE-HEE LIGHTING /WOO HYO-JAE ART DIRECTOR / CHO SANG-KYUNG SOUND / YOON JONG-MIN FILM EDITOR SON YEON-JI MUSIC / JEONG YONG-JIM ASSISTANT DIRECTOR / CHOI BEOM-CHAN SHIN DONG-MI, KIM KANG-HYUN YU JUN-SANG WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY LEE KWANG-KUK A MATTER OF INTERPRETATION So... - You closed up? - Yes. I should've advertised harder... Forget it. It's out of your hands. Come on, Director. Let's just practice again by ourselves. I felt like we weren't ready anyway. It's better this way. What do you think? Hey. wait! I know we were low on budget, but no one sees a show at 2 P.M. on a weekday. This is ridiculous. Hey. Aren't you being harsh? You're not the only one feeling like shit. Is that so? That was a great delivery you just gave. Better than at rehearsals. Excuse me? Come on. Don't do this in front of the kids. I'm sick of this! How many times has it been? Why rehearse for a show no one watches? You didn't think this would happen? Let's just drop it. I'm tired enough as it is. - I know. - Just let her leave! Stay out of it. Let's just forget about it and drink some soju. - Hey. - Yeah? Stop stuffing your face. Get out of my way. Hey! I'll never come back here again. Sir... How many bottles of soju? Shut up. ARIRANG ART HALL - Look who it is! - What are you up to? What do you think? Breastfeeding my son, of course. Precious little thing. You were hungry? - Good little boy. - Life is that good? He's my whole world. What are you doing? Feel like some soju? - Soju? - Yeah. Just come and have some breast milk instead. It sure is turning my son into a handsome boy. Precious boy. Bring your own bottle. - So are you coming? - Of course I am. Just wait until my son gets into college. My handsome boy. - Hey. - Yeah? To tell you the truth... Yeah? Your son is ugly as hell since he takes after you. Did your breast milk get a nose job too? What? Hello? Hey! Hello, leading lady. - You busy? - Not at all. - Don't you have a show today? - No. Why? - I dreamt about you last night. - Me? Then you might have bad luck today. I can'! remember much, but I called because I got a strange feeling. - Anything new? - Same as always. But it's an honor to get a call from such a star. - You made my day. - Crazy bitch. Good to hear you're okay. But be careful today. It wasn't a good dream. I wish something would happen. Are you shooting? Yeah. I'm getting sick of it. Money is useless without time to spend it. Miss the old stage days with you. Look who's all high and mighty. - I'll put your money to good use. - Sure. I'll go out and buy you a nice man. Take care. - Hey. - Yeah? Get me a young one, while you're at it. But no actors. Hey. Be careful today. - Got it? - Yes, ma'am. - Take care. - You too. - I'll call you later. - All right. You didn't pick up. I looked everywhere. Let's go somewhere warm. Huh? Leave me alone. That kid I told you about, I saw him again on my way here. He was drawing in the street again. I took pictures this time. It'll cheer you up. It was a bad script. And the role was weak. The director has a bad reputation. They say his last film was purely luck. Hey. You know how much I wanted to do this film. Yeah. And that I was waiting to sign the contract. Yeah. Goddamn it... How could they hire a pop idol? She's never even acted before! It happens all the time. - Don't mind things like that. - Hey! No one ever explained or apologized to me! The director and producer won't answer my calls. A goddamn assistant called me. I even memorized lines for the opposite role. The entire script. Top to bottom. For months... I carried that script everywhere. You think you know how I feel? Don't wave it off because it's not your life. I didn't do that. I'm upset too, but... Then stop making it worse and shut up. Let's break up. What? - Let's stop seeing each other. - Hey! We both have no future. We'll wear ourselves out. I'm sick of this. I'll come up with a plan. Plan? What plan? How many years has it been? We've been scraping by and making ends meet for years! Are you gonna quit theater, then? I'm gonna quit, but I know you can't. I'm sick of it all. There must be a solution. Just give me some time. Time? Do you even understand time? Do you realize how old I've become? I can barely have children. I've wasted my best years with you. It's all gone. No one gives a damn about what we do. But we have each other. We can give a damn about us and support each other. Who cares if other people don't pay attention? You used to be so happy when you were on stage. That's more important! Stop being so childish and snap out of it. Being with you makes everything more frustrating. It's been that way for a while. Don't call me. Take care. Yeon-shin! You there. Me? You shouldn't do that. Do what? You can't smoke in a non-smoking park. Put that out. Fine. Carry on now. - Not until I see you put it out. - Okay. Fine. You can't just smoke because no one is watching. Fuck. What are you, a cop? Then write me a ticket! I knew it was a bad dream! - I'm a detective. - What? It's not part of my job to write tickets though. Don't do it again. Yelling and cursing is bad for your health. Too late now. - Why are you out in the cold? - What's it to you? I don't know what you're up to, but you should be careful. It's a harsh world out there. Then what are you doing here? A stakeout? Stakeout... I'm still on duty, but it's just so cold... I always admired how Russians drink vodka all daylong. One drink couldn't hurt. That's mine! There was a suicide case nearby. I stopped by there, and took a stroll to clear my head. - A suicide? - Yes. - Did someone die? - Of course. It's a suicide. Young, too. - Is it top secret? - No, I just felt bad. Died alone in a car. - How did they... - Just a lit briquette and a will. What did it say? You still use matches! How classic. What are you doing? Let's have a smoke while we're at it. But... I could tell by the will how lonely that person was. Not a single person who really understood. It said that all they wanted was a person who understood. How lonely that must have felt. How tragic. - I think I know how that feels. - Right? But that's so strange. I had a dream last night. I mentioned it earlier when you were badgering me. Anyway... I've been having a bad day today, but it's so strange now that I've heard your story. What was the dream about? It's all a mess and I can't remember most of it. I know a thing or two about dreams. - You said you're a detective. - With an expertise on dreams. Seems like just a nonsense detective to me. You've got nothing to lose. I'm known for interpreting dreams back at the precinct. You're not just joking? It's just a silly dream. FIRE-SPARKING BRISQUETTE Thank you! Thank you! I'm so grateful! If you could untie me, I'd be more grateful. - So grateful. - What... What happened? - How did you end up there? - I'll tell you if you untie the rest. Water, please. Please give me some water. - This is all I have. - Soju! My darling soju. Even better. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. How can this be? Tell me about it. But what were you doing in my car? Pardon? - This is your car? - Why else would I be here? I'm sorry. I thought it was abandoned. No, it's okay. You ended up saving my life. But what happened? I don't really know myself. Who did this to you? I wonder who. I'm still so confused. It might have been yesterday, or a few days ago. - Were you kidnapped? - No, I don't think so. Should I call the police? No, no. I remember sitting inside my car... What! - I need your help, sir. - I'm busy right now. It won't take long! I'm really busy. - Sir! - What are you doing? - Just open the trunk for me. - What? I lost something important. I think it's in the trunk. - That's absurd. - Just open the trunk. - Absolutely not. - Please, just once. Sheesh. Don't bat your eyes at me. Here it is! It's really important to me. But what were you doing inside my car? Huh? What were you doing in my car? I'm sorry. I thought it was abandoned. Have a seat here. - You were trying to kill yourself? - I failed. I understand that your life must be very hard, but think of the people you're leaving behind. I'll give you these. Cheer up and don't give up. I don't like plays. Go see it with your friends. It's a great show. No thank you. I'm trying to be nice here! Interesting dream. Nonsense, isn't it? I don't even remember his face. - Maybe I'm growing taller. - What do you do for a living? I'm a theater actress. - Doing shows no one watches. - I see. I got that vibe from your face. - You read faces too? - No. - But I think it's a good dream. - How so? You recently ended a relationship? - What? - Am I right? Well, it's been almost a year now. - And you ended it? - That's right! Haven't you been worried about your ex being devastated? It kept you up nights, right? Oh my god! - You really can interpret dreams? - It's nothing. - So what else? - Here's what I think. You think your ex isn't getting over you, and he's probably devastated. You're worried he might even kill himself like in the dream. You're incredible. - But what does the old car mean? - That reappearing car? What about this theory? A boyfriend with a beat-up car is better than one with no car at all. That's probably why you two fought. I'm guessing he wasn't successful. Oh my god! Are you really a detective? This is insane. You're right! We fought over cars and such. I bet you catch the bad guy on every single case. - I'm the worst in my precinct. - Why? Forensics just aren't my thing. People only trust science, but imagination is what matters. They just don't see that. - What about the theater tickets? - Well... Since there were two tickets... - Maybe you'll meet someone new. - No way. That was a weak conclusion. - But why is it a good dream? - It shows your genuine concern. And genuine concern doesn't go unappreciated. It felt like you two really cared for each other. I don't understand why you don't catch more bad guys. I just keep getting suicide cases. - There are that many suicides? - The most around the world. Everyone thinks making money is most important. No one sees the people that slip away through the cracks. They only care about themselves. I was like that too, until recently. How about now? Now I at least try. - You have to live it to realize it. - What happened? My sister is ill. Let's eat. - Let's eat. - Huh? I said, let's eat. What were you staring at? - Huh? - What were you staring at? You still can't hear well? It comes and goes. What were you staring at? On the calendar. - I must've done it myself. - What? - The circle. - When did you draw it? Must be before I fell, but I don't remember. It can't be anyone's birthday or anything... Maybe it's an anniversary? - I don't know. - Just eat. You can think about it later. Here. Open up. That's too much. Eat up. There you go. - Your appetite is back! - I should eat well. - And take my medicine. - You should. - In order to live. - That's right. - You still have that dream? - Huh? - The dream you keep having? - Yeah. The customer goes without paying. We fight. You were so sick of working and now you dream about it. - Huh? - You're dreaming about work! Never mind. Eat up. Let's eat fast and go exercise. - Can't let the cold stop you. - Okay. You're done already? Gosh. - I exercised for ages. - Huh? Wow. It's already been half an hour. It feels like I had a dream when I was barely asleep. - I should try hard to live. - You should. You know that circle on the calendar? - Huh? - February 7th. Yeah. Was that when you were going on a trip with your friends? - A trip? - It's not? I don't know. I'm becoming an idiot. No, you're not. That's just your illness talking. I'm happy. Being with you. - You are? - Yeah. Eating together. Taking walks together. It was lonely being alone. I like having company. - We were never close. - No, we weren't. I'm sorry. - I never made the time. - Huh? I said I'm sorry. Never mind. - You should sell my taxi. - Okay. I was going to do that when you woke up. The papers... - Everything should be in the car. - I'll take care of it. I'm happy I don't have to drive. - I was sick of it. - It was all for the best. But how do I make a living now? My Will. Please scatter my ashes. I prefer rivers, seas, and mountains to charnel houses. Scatter me into the water, the wind, and the earth. This is my final request. February 7th, SEO Dong-bee. You can't park here like this! Move your car, now! You're awake? - Move your car. - Wake up. It's you. Were you dreaming? - Did you have a dream? - Yeah. What was it about? Tell me. You haven't shared for a while. It's the same one. Tell me anyway. I'm curious. Come on. - Someone got into my car. - Yeah. Someone got in... Go inside and get it now. The truth is... I don't live here. It's where my ex lives. I missed her throughout my trip and came here on impulse. What in the world are you talking about? - I've got mouths to feed. - I'm so sorry. When are you free? I'll bring the money to you. I promise. You're out of your mind. Jesus. Does February 7th work for you? Sure. Thank you so much. I'll save it in my calendar. Wow. This is a very lucky date. Lots of people are moving and getting married on this day. You picked a great date. That's good to hear. It's the date I was recommended for killing myself. Is it? Well, it's a great day to die. You picked one hell of a day. Saved. But what's the rush? You're still young and quite beautiful. My mother appeared in a dream and told me to meet her then. Every time I had that dream, she kept saying that date. I haven't seen her for years, and I do miss her. I was planning on dying anyway, so why not? I see. You should meet your mother. It does seem like the best way to meet someone. You only end up fighting in this life. I don't have anyone. Just a busy sibling that I don't see much often. It's been that way for a while. True happiness is having someone you really connect with. I'm also having a hard time since my relationship ended. My mother said she had a million things to say to me that day. - But she was younger than me. - Huh? She was younger than me when she passed away. - Strange being older than my mother. - I would imagine. I'm glad I'll be repaying you on such an auspicious day. You can use it to pay the boatman. I guess I could. I'll be waiting here that day at this time. - It's in your calendar. Don't forget. - Of course not. Then I'll see you here that day. - Thank you. - Sure. Drive safely! Thank you! You must've felt awful. But you're very fortunate. I am. If she hadn't had the fall, she might have killed herself that day. Isn't that ironic? Did your sister remember what that date meant? No, that was it. She eats and exercises more than she used to. Her appetite for life has grown. But maybe she's pretending not to remember. Strange, isn't it? That's good. It's for the best, I guess. I wonder what she dreamt of. I like hearing about dreams since I seldom have them. I don't really believe in dreams, but today sure is a strange day. The pills and brisquette from my dream... How could the same things be in your sister's car? It's merely coincidence, but it is very strange. You don't even know each other. How long had you and your boyfriend been together? About seven years. A long time. What did he do for a living? There you go interrogating again, Detective. I'm sorry. I just became curious. We were both in theater. I'm always curious to hear about such an exotic line of work. They seem like they live in a different world from us. I heard it's tough. Nothing is easy. But fuck... - It sure is tough. - Cursing suits you. - Thank you. - He must've loved that about you. How could he let go of such a charming person? I was being foolish. He was so mature and sensible, unlike me. Aren't you cold? - What are you working so hard on? - Nothing. I don't know what it is, but it looks great. I'm sure people will love it once they see it. - That's not why I'm drawing it. - Then why? Because it's fun. - I saw it in a dream last night. - You did? - I have a lot of work to do. - Don't mind me. But won't you get into trouble with your mom again? I don't care. It's too good to waste. Can I take a picture of it? Whatever you want. Hey! - Where are you going? - To see you guys. Where are you going? What about rehearsal? It's over today, thanks to your woman. Why? Did something happen? She's not answering the phone. I think that director bastard screwed her over. - She cried for a while and left. - What are you talking about? What did he do to her? She wouldn't say, but I think she got cut. - Where did she go? - No idea. Everyone left and I'm going out to eat. Gosh... Thanks for the snacks. Go and look for her. She didn't seem well today. I will. Thanks. But share it with everyone. Don't stuff yourself. FORTUNE TELLER Excuse me. Yes? - You're Director CHOI Du-kyung? - Yes. - You want an autograph? - Forget it. You need to apologize. For what? My friend is a great actress. But you've made her really upset. I don't know what you're talking about. You can't go hurting people to make those bad movies of yours. - Are you an actor? - What? Excuse me for asking, but could you turn your head? Like this? Magnificent. You have a great look. - Would you like to be in my film? - What? - Where have you been all this time? - Seriously? You're truly a rare find. Thank you. I'm pretty experienced, you know. It's just that people don't recognize me much. None of that matters. I knew it the minute I saw you. You're a natural-born actor. - Let's talk over a cup of tea. - Sure. - Wait. Do you drink? - Yes. Then let's go get a drink. - We'll talk over the details there. - Sure. I had such a good dream last night. I guess it was a good omen. - Let's go. - Thank you, sir! Hey! Young fellow! Get up. You can't drink and smoke here. - You young people these days.. - I'm sorry, sir. You could've frozen to death sleeping out here. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to fall asleep. A decent-looking man like you lying out here like a bum. Throw it all in here. Wait a second. Haven't we met before? No, we haven't. Pick it all up. I step out for a minute and this happens. I don't know why people deliberately disobey rules. And a young man like you. Drinking in broad daylight. You should be doing something. Mister. I'm having a rough day today. I'll leave after I think for a bit, so please go. How bad could your life be? - You need to have dreams in life. - Then what about you? - Which dream led you to live like this? - Excuse me? - Does this job seem stupid to you? - Sheesh. You know why this world is so messed up? All these people value money and go around making trouble. What we do is precious and important. We should value our own callings instead of being greedy. Don't work so hard! You won't starve. You don't know what you're talking about. Some jobs can starve you even if you work hard. - Do you even have a job? - I'm a theater actor, okay? - And you're not going hungry? - No... - Just go away, sir. - Poor young man. But you should keep it up, while you're at it. All my years have taught me that it's all the same. This or that, whatever you do, it all passes. Might as well have fun on the way. It might not be easy, but I think that's better. All right. Thank you. - I'll be back, so keep it clean. - Fine. Such a lovely day today. Just lovely. This is ridiculous. Day in and day out. While all the neighbors' kids are mastering in English... - What will he become? - Ma'am. - Couldn't you just leave it? - What are you talking about? Just leave it there. It's nice. A mess is what this is. It's not like you're gonna clean it up for me. Good thing running into you. - When will you pay the rent? - Soon. So please, just leave it alone. Your son worked hard on it. Pay up and I'll worry about my son. I will! What are you yelling at me for? I'll pay you the stupid rent. You think this is just some messy drawing? This is what's really pure and important in this world. We should notice it! We should embrace it in order to make the world better. I won't pay up if you wash it away. Okay? Jesus. This is all your fault. Have some shame! What in the world... I see. You were drinking here for a reason. Well, that's not all... We canceled our show today because no one came. I see. I come here whenever I get frustrated. And how is he these days? People started talking a few months after that. Said he quit theater altogether. Moved somewhere. - I haven't heard from him since. - That's too bad. Two hard-working people. I'm still doing this because I couldn't let go. I never imagined he could quit so suddenly. He just vanished. Maybe that's why I feel worse and can't forget about him. But how do you keep doing it if it's this hard to get by? I don't know. It was all passion at first, and time flew by. I came down from the stage once and couldn't remember a thing. I didn't have to think or worry on the stage. I wasn't even myself. I was completely lost in the moment. That thrill is what I loved about it. It's hard to describe. But I wished I could be like that more and more each day. That's what kept me going. I can't imagine what that feels like. I'm sure you've lost yourself in a moment too. You think so? Look at the time. I'll be going now. All right. I'm gonna think for a bit more. I had a strange, but lovely time. Right. Okay. Me too. I feel a bit better, thanks to you. If your show is still on, may I come and watch? Oh. Go see it if you're free. - I was hoping not to give them out... - Thank you. Oh! I guess you dreamt about it so you could give this to me. Curious. I guess so. That's funny. - Keep warm. - Right. - Take good care of the dead. - Okay. What will I do with him? That little idiot! - Hello. - What's this? It's been a long time. - How have you been? - What brings you here? He moved out long ago. Didn't you know? I was just passing by. You two broke up? No wonder. - You didn't come when he moved. - Right... A wise decision. - Are you married? - Not yet. Nailing a good man is most important. Men who do art are nothing but trouble. A man has to put bread on the table. Are all theater people as pathetic as him? He stayed in his room for days like some kind of hermit. I was so worried my son would end up like him. Did your son draw this? Damn scribbling putting his good blood to waste. I'm at my wit's end. He wants to be a painter, but I'll nip that in the bud. Can't you just leave it? It's nice. How peculiar... Isn't it nice? It's sweet and lovely. It's the only thing good about this lousy house of yours. What did you just say? I feel so bad for your son. Born under the wrong parents. But hardships like this will sculpt him into a true artist. Carry on. You little! Sir? - Huh? - It's a non-smoking zone. I'm sorry. Could I smoke just one? We're out in the open. Rules exists for a reason. Put it out. - Just one cigarette. - Put it out. Sheesh. Then report me. I'll pay the fine. Unfortunately, I'm a detective. Although fines and tickets aren't my line of duty. - I'm sorry. - Must public power always step in? Give me a break. I put it out. You're giving me attitude? - Are you really a detective? - Unbelievable. I guess you're on a stakeout. - Show me your identification. - What? Identification. I need to run an inspection. No criminal records. What's your occupation? I'm taking time off right now, okay? What a crazy day... It's all because of that bad dream. - What kind of dream? - What do you care? Don't you have a case to tend to somewhere? Do you inspect dreams too? What happened to forensic science? And what do you know about dreams? A thing or two. Enough to surprise everyone so far. - Is that so? - You don't believe me. Feel free to be on your way any time, so I can smoke once you're gone. Since you're so doubtful, I propose this. If you don't like my interpretation, we'll both smoke a cigarette. - I never back down. - Are you for real? Don't change your mind later. Great. We'll smoke if it's not fun. Turn off the engine. You beat the gun. Driver's license, please. No way. I think you're wrong. - Quickly, sir. - I swear I didn't. I was watching the speed the whole time. Isn't there something wrong with that machine? Driver's license. I think I left my wallet at home. I thought I had it... Open the trunk. What? I need to run an inspection. - Not the trunk... - Open it. Gosh. - How old is this car? - Pardon? - How old is this car? - Eighteen years old. This thing still runs? Eighteen years old. My younger sibling is the same age. Our parents are gone and I have to support him. But he wants to go to college. Tuition is expensive, isn't it? I don't really know. It must be. Just look at my weathered hands. See? I'm so sorry. I really did leave my wallet at home. Open the trunk. - What? - Open it. Okay. - You shouldn't carry this around. - Why not? - You don't have a baby. - Why does that matter? Why do you have baby clothes when you have no baby? What are you talking about? - I'm taking you in. Get in. - What? - Go on in. - Why are you doing this? - Hurry up now. - Huh? But I didn't do anything wrong! You did everything wrong. That's how it ended. So what does it mean? You seem distraught. I'm gonna smoke and leave, so think about it. You wanted to get married but couldn't. You even thought of getting her pregnant to tie her down. But you were too scared to beat the gun. The missing wallet means you weren't financially stable. It's basically a dream ridden with guilt. Weren't you eventually dumped? Sir... - How in the world... - Am I right? - Did you major in this? - I only finished high school. But you're so good at it. My girlfriend and I broke up after a long relationship. But I knew it was all my fault. I had known it for some time before we broke up. But I didn't want to let her go. There are so many things in life that forensics can't explain. She really loved this place. I haven't come back here for years. Even a drab-looking park like this is full of memories. Even I know a woman who has memories here. It hasn't changed. The same now as ever. Since everyone meets and parts, it all seems common. But traces always remain with us, like evidence of a crime scene. A journey to find that one true connection. Sir. Do you really believe in dreams? I would rather say that dreams help us come to terms. Everyone wants to clear things up because life is so muddled. - Wouldn't you agree? - That's incredible. It must be convenient for you when you dream. I don't really know, because I seldom ever dream. That's why I love hearing about other people's dreams. There's always a story to it. I wonder how that must feel. Oh. Look at the time. Well... You're just gonna go? But you've got me hooked. I'm a bit busy. It's like I've seen a ghost. - Mister! - It's you, kid! - Long time no see. - How have you been? What happened to your face? I got hurt. - You've grown big. - Looks like you've grown too. Have I? Where are you off to? - I need a walk to clear my head. - You do? - You need to clear your head too? - Life isn't any fun. It's all so boring. It sure is boring. - You don't draw anymore? - Nope. Mom promised me a puppy if I ace my English test. - I'm just gonna study now. - I see. But it was more fun when you were around. You liked my drawings. You should keep on drawing, even if not on the wall. Your drawings are too nice to put to waste. Mom says I'll be a poor beggar if I keep drawing. - I don't want that. - Right. Well, bye Mister. All right. - Think healthy thoughts, kid. - You too, Mister. Foul! My goodness! What do you think you're doing? Oh. I was just looking at the car. Why? Is this your car, Mister? - Yes, it's mine. - Oh. So it's still running. Was it standing here all this time? It wasn't here all the time, but it's been here for years. - Why do you ask? - Nothing. It just feels unfamiliar. I don't think I've seen it parked here before. You won't notice unless you pay attention. But it was here all this time. How could I not have seen it? It's hard not to notice such an old car. I know. What is this about? I was just... Mister. - Could you open the trunk for me? - What? It's just such a beautiful car. I'm sure the trunk opens in a peculiar way too. No. But I'm just so curious. Just once. Please? - What are you even talking about? - Please, Mister. - Just this once. - Don't bat your eyes at me! One. Two. Three. What happened? What are you doing here? - Untie these too. Quick! - Right. Sorry. It's really you. You're here. You don't know how much I prayed. - Give me some water. - Hold on. - This is all I have. - Soju. I'm sick of this stuff, but... What happened? Who did this to you? That cop, but... I ranted at the landlady for being so mean to her son... I told you not to meddle in other people's business! I never showed you his drawings. Wow. He's really good. It's nice. She's so blind to his talent. - Say... - Huh? Have you been well? Sure. I don't do theater anymore. It's a big load off my mind. - What do you do? - Huh? I just make money. It's better this way. I'm sorry. But how could you not even contact me once? I didn't have the courage. And don't be sorry. I'm sorry. I put you through so much. You don't light brisquettes and plan your suicide, do you? Why would I commit suicide? I should enjoy life. I like not working in theater, but I keep thinking about it. - You do? - Yeah. I often dream of being back on stage. I realize it's not real in the dream and feel really sad. Then do it again. I don't know. Things will get bad again and I don't have the confidence. I might not be much good, but I know you're talented. I told you after I first saw you on stage. I don't remember. I felt like I could keep on living after I first saw you perform. I felt courage. Everything else was so boring. Come back and I'll be there for you. Even if no one cares at all, I'll cheer you on. I'm feeling honored. Anything you want to eat? I'll buy you everything. That's okay. But I feel a little cold. - You do? - Yeah. I'm cold. Hold on for one minute. What are you doing? Just come back. It's so warm. Thank you. - Isn't this nice? - It is. Playing with fire again, like when I was a kid. I forgot. Mom told me not to play with fire. We're not kids anymore. But she said playing with fire makes anyone wet their bed. Stop talking nonsense. I guess once will be okay. Woo-yeon. Yeah? Woo-yeon. What is it? - Yeon-shin. - Yeah? Look at that. What are you doing? That's yours. I see you're staying healthy. I'm giving this to you. - Now? - Yeah. - Here? - Sure. My goodness. Sheesh. What in the... What's this? That goddamn bastard. Goddamn it. Detective! - You're back! - Yeah. Don't smile. I told you to stop stuffing yourself! - I will. - Did you eat yet? I just did. Looking good, Yoon. Now give it back. But I memorized your lines. Then should I just go? - In that case, I'll keep this on. - Come on. We were so worried when you wouldn't pick up. I'm gonna go home again if no one shows today. Fine by me. Thanks for coming back. The newbie. Where did our newbie go? He went to take a dump. We've still got time. Why does he always go right before ticketing? He said just handing out tickets makes him nervous. Doesn't poop stand for good luck in dreams? Big news! Oh, you're back! - Bow politely. - You clogged the toilet again? We have an audience. - Really? - How many? One person! What the... We still have some time. More people will come. But they seemed to know you. - Me? - Yes. Who is it? I don't know. He wanted to see you outside. - Now? - Yes. How have you been? Good. What are you doing here? I saw a poster for your show. No one came. Really? It does seem pretty quiet. I bought a ticket for today. Yeah. - Thank you. - Don't. No one came yesterday, so we canceled. You did? How about today? I'm not sure yet. But thanks anyway. It's great to see you still working in theater. What do you do now? Oh, just... Where did you move? Not too far off. - I came out of the blue and startled you. - Yeah. Well, not so out of the blue. What do you mean? You bastard. Because of you this morning... - Never mind. - What is it? Do you want to wait downstairs? You know everyone anyway. - Who's running the ticket booth? - Our newbie. He asked me why I wasn't buying two tickets. Yeah, he's our darling. Those are the best few years. I'm here as audience today, so I'll say hello after the show. Sure. - I'll see you after the show. - Okay. Everything's okay though? Of course. - I saw you in my dreams last night. - Me? Then today is your lucky day. Yeah. It's been a good day right from the morning. See you later. Go on inside.
