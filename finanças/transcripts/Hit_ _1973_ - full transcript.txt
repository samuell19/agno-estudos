Hey, man, I'm just a little guy. Why kill me, man? I'm just a little guy. Hey, man, I'm just a worker. A worker, man, that's all! What good will it do for you to kill me, man? I'm just a worker. You kill me, man, there are some more cats out here selling the same shit I'm selling, man. Nobody goes after them cats on top, man. What good will it do to kill me, man? Hey, man, them cats, they sitting out there on them yachts and sucking up champagne and eating caviar and all that shit, man. I'm freezing out here selling this shit.

Thank you, sir. [door opens] [door shuts] Sit. Sit down. I'm sorry about your daughter. Look, Nick... listen to me, huh? Take a month. You need a good rest. I've got a nice, soft assignment for you-- Hawaii. Six weeks. It's beautiful. It's just a little surveillance. Now, come on. It's a lot nicer than Santiago or Panama or Athens. Huh? Nick, you're a good man, and I like your work. Move him up. Grade seven, effective the end of this month. Hell, we'll make it effective right now, okay.? No. You want to do something about it, huh? Your style? Direct action? You want to bust pushers? Okay, suppose we bust pushers. That's not exactly what I had in mind. I see. Well, what did you have in mind, Nick? Go right to the source. I never heard that, Nick. I'm not here. You and I never met. This meeting never happened, Okay? Now I'm giving you a grade seven. You deserve the promotion. Nick... you take that plane to Hawaii tonight, huh? You enjoy that vacation, right? All right, Nick? You understand? Now, you do that. I have a meeting with the boss man, Nick. Have a nice trip. Good luck and good morning. Sir... Hmm? I'm going to do it. You won't make it, Nick. [organ plays] The bus terminal. You know, I can't get over that guy. I've known him a long time. You been getting any lately? You are an impertinent son of a bitch. Ain't nothing sacred to you? I'll bet you something. $2.00 he goes to Dulles. You can bet on that. You make it worth my while, I'll take the bet. 2.50. Would you like to give me the money now or later? Follow him in. As soon as he hits the door, you go out. Your next scheduled rest stop will be Greasewood, Pennsylvania. There's a restroom at the rear of the coach for your convenience. Please, watch your step. Did you find out where he's going? He's going to St. Louis. That's where he bought a ticket for, but I'll bet he don't go there. Maybe he won't. You know what I ought to do? What? Next time that bus stops, I ought to get out of this car walk right up to that bus, nice as you please, and get right on that god damn bus, pull out my gun and blow his god damn head off. [horn honks] What are they stopping for? Hmm? Yes, sir. He's getting out. That son of a bitch. Make a left. No, wait. Wait a minute. [horn honking] You got a loose wire in your distributor cap. Ought to learn more about your car. I'll be damned. Hey, pretty mama. Don't give me that pretty mama shit. I haven't seen you since April. You could've called. I know they have phones wherever it was you were. Look here, I can't hear you. You have to roll down your window. Too bad. I know you're there. You don't have to knock. Hey. You miss me? Yeah, I missed you. You're not going to give it to me? No, I'm not going to give it to you. What am I supposed to do? I guess you're supposed to get it yourself. Oh? "Oh?" is it okay? Is it what you wanted? Yes... yes. You did beautiful, baby. I'm not even going to ask what this is about. That's good. Nick... are you really all right? I will be. You know, the government pays me $18,000 to be a computer programmer. I'd trade every single cent just for one night with you. I can't stay. I can't. Listen... if you really have to leave... would you just go? Please? You're really serious about that mission of yours, aren't you? Yep. No, I'm too old, and I'm still too young. Anyway, I got my own job. I don't know what you heard, but I got some troubles, but they're my troubles. They keep telling me I'm too violent. Too violent. I get the job done, and that's the important thing, right, getting the job done? Absolutely. I'll tell you what. Why don't you look me up in six years? I'll be on a pension then. I'll be looking for something to do, but right now, I got my own mission. There's a fortune in smack across the street, and they won't give me a warrant. They tell me I don't have enough evidence. You're a genius at surveillance. Yeah. How do you plan to get them? Under the influence. Then I can search them without their damn warrant. Hmm. You know those bastards make a fucking good hamburger? These french fries ain't too bad, either. Let's go get the bastards. Can I help you? Yeah, you can help me. Put your hands on the car. Who are you? You know who I am. Put your hands on the car. You got a warrant? Put your hands on the car. I got my rights! You beat him, didn't you? You beat the hell out of that man. If anybody knows about excessive force, you should know. This ain't the first time you've been in this court, nor will it be the last. It's a waste of time to take this man and keep him incarcerated. As far as I'm concerned, he's-- [bangs gavel] Son of a bitch! What the hell are you going to do? Here's a complete list of the top people. That I'm to do what with? I don't know. I mean, you the, uh... you're the genius at surveillance. [laughing] I feel great! I love it. I'll see you later, man. You know those bastards can't even make a decent hamburger over there? Ah, merci, merci. That's good. Now I'm going to take one of you. Go right in there. That's good. Now hold it. Great big smile. That's it. That's it. Hold it right there. Oh, that's beautiful. Just one more. Yeah, that's good. Oh, that's lovely! Oh, baby. That's beautiful. [horn honks] Incidentally, it's $100 for the afternoon. $100, huh? $100. Okay. 100. Thank you. Let me give you another 100. You're so nice to me. That's 'cause you're so cute. Thank you. Do you want to go in the bedroom? It's more comfortable. Come on. Well, uh... I'm very comfortable here. I just want to talk. You gave me two bills just to talk? I like talking. If you want to give me $200 just to talk... I'll just have to take $200 from you. What do you want to talk about? Oh... Do you want to talk dirty? No, no, no, no. I'll talk dirty with you. I don't want to talk dirty. I don't mind-- anything that gets you off. It's okay with me. What's that, a dirty story? You're going to read me a dirty story I'll bet. You're something else, you know that? Sherry Nielson... Mmm-mmm. "Graduated Great Neck High School, "1965. "President of the French Club, Barnard College, class of 1969." Dropped out in the spring of '69 three weeks before graduation. Lived in a commune, changed boyfriends, a hairy in a tank shirt... love, peace, and heroin. Became addicted to all three, especially the heroin. Okay, you see this money? You take your money and get the fuck out right now. I'm not finished talking. Get the fuck out. I'm going to call my lawyer. Because if you don't have a warrant, you better get the fuck out of here. Ah... I suppose the last tenant left this here? You're right. The last tenants left that there. So in that case, then, uh... you won't have any need for it,right? Since the stuff was from the last tenants, you aren't going to need it, are you? You're not going to start screaming when your system starts craving for something and you can't get it? We're not talking about you, are we? We're talking about the last tenants. I'm going to sit here and find out. You know, I have this quizzical nature. I get very interested in things, and I have to find out what's going on. You'll have to be very clear about what's happening. Have you ever sweated it out cold turkey? Before it's all over, baby, you'll wish you were dead. Is that what you want, Sherry? You want me to call the narcs and have them take you downtown, or do you want me to give it to you free? Free... for the rest of your life. Every day in your life. Just do a little job for me. Do I have a choice? Yeah, you have a choice. You can go downtown... or you can come with me. Hey, buddy. You sell hamburgers here? Pardon? You sell ze hamburger? Hamburger? Non, non, monsieur. Well, thanks, anyway. [bells chime] I'll be back in an hour. Can you come running, too? In the arboretum? Any time in the arboretum. Okay, I'll see ya. Okay, I'll see ya. Is there something I can do for you? "Trong Van Duck." Chong Van Duc. "Le Van Ho." Le Van How. "Nguyen Lo Minh."Nguyeen Lo Minh. Oh, shit. Well, you'll have to excuse me. I-- I don't know Vietnamese. I don't know the pronunciation. Listen, you guys have been chasing me for about three years, and there's nothing there. There's no evidence, and I'm tired of it and your goddamn questions. No, no more questions. Just a little proposition. Uh... ahem. Um, according to your file, you're quite remarkable with a rifle... and you don't mind killing. My daddy used to say I was a regular hunting dog... with ducks and... possum and... coon. Ha ha ha ha! Oh, boy. Ahem. Well... Uncle Sam wants you again. Uncle Sam's had me, and Uncle Sam knows what Uncle Sam can do with Uncle Sam. Those students think a lot of you. I wonder what they would think if they knew what your were called in 'Nam-- Barry Strong, the happy horseman, the richest corporal in Vietnam. And we can prove 80,000. No, you can't. You can't prove nothing. I've been out of the Army for three years, and they can't touch me. Well, you're right. They can't, but you're forgetting about someone. The Internal Revenue. Income tax. They don't have to prove how you got it, only that you have it, and you owe the tax. 44,000 plus interest plus penalties... which makes it another... 29,000 plus... and, of course, there's the criminal trial for income tax evasion. Now... you want to talk to me? Give that to me in real money. $700. Jesus Christ. Now you hang out for a little while and have a sandwich or something. I'll be a while. I'm not paying it. So just tell them that I'm not paying it till I get my '69 refund. $48.50. Tell Internal Revenue to fuck themselves. I'll wait as long as you guys. I'm not afraid of going to jail or nothing. This is bullshit to me, man. I'm not from the Internal Revenue. You look like a collector with that suit. I didn't know they had no niggers in there. We got quite a few of them. According to your file, your sense of humor tells me you must be Mr. Willmer, Michael F. Willmer? That's me. "Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering, Morgan State." That's Oregon State. Hmm. "U.S. Navy, 10 years." 9 1/2. "Advanced marine engineering, Newport School." Where? Where's that say? Advanced marine engineering, Newport School. Washington State. "Underwater Warfare School, San Diego." Charleston, South Carolina. It's a pretty wrong list you got there. What other wrong shit you got about me? Your wife was raped and murdered by a junkie. What do you want? Uncle Sam wants to give you an opportunity to, uh, get even. No... it's over. She's dead. I forgot about it. I want to forget about it. Look here... Mike? Also it says here that you, uh... that you have a taste for expensive brandy. Yeah. Why don't you let Uncle Sam buy you a drink? Let Uncle Sam buy me a drink? Mm-hmm. $48.50 worth? You got it. Yougot it. How long were you married, Mike? What? I said how long were you married? 3 1/2 of the greatest years that any man could have in the world anyplace on the face of the earth. How old was she? When she died, she was...20. 20. Went to court, man. This son of a bitch... fucking trial. 10 days, man, in the can. Fucking junkie. Dig this now, man. He's a junkie, I understand that, man, but he didn't have to kill her or rape her. He raped her, man, and he killed her. And it took 'em 10 days, man. Every day I saw him in the courtroom, he had that look on his fucking face. I couldn't get to him to kill him. I wanted to kill that motherfucker. And they had him. It's like they were saving him. I had to throw it out of my mind 'cause I was going fucking crazy. I went home, took all the fucking furniture, everything we'd made together, and burned it. I got 30 days for having a fucking fire. Will we get there in the next 50 years? Where you taking me? We're almost there. Is that a prison? My friend's the assistant warden. He's a bug on fine brandies, just like you. [horn honks] joe springer! Hey, old buddy. What's going on? How you doing? Good to see you. Good to see you. How's everything? Can't complain.How's the family? Oh, just doing great. Everything's fine. Meet a friend of mine. Mike Willmer, this here's Joe Springer. Mike, how you doing? This your brandy man? Uh-huh. Well, let's try him out on a drink. Help yourself. I didn't believe you. Man. Let's see if I can get this... help yourself to that. Ah, there we go. All right. Look out. Here we go, gentlemen. To you. Oh. Whoo. Did I flash on that. You flash on that? Go ahead. Have another flash. St. Moritz, 1959. Made by the monks. He is a brandy man. May I have another one? Help yourself. You get another flash on that? I was telling him a joke in the car about a couple of nuns, right? And they, um... just then... and they got, uh... they got raped. They got their throats cut. Wait a minute, Joe. Let him go over there. Wait a minute, now! W-w-wait a minute. Goddamn, wait a minute, man! I want my wife! You took my wife! Let him have his say. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You took my soul! You took my soul! You can't give it back! He took my wife. I want to kill! I want to kill! Mike! Mike! Mike, you want to kill somebody? I'll give you the right people to kill. I'll give you the right people to kill. Yes. A toast. In America, we say "to good neighbors." Yes. Yes. Halt. Hi, Pete. Hi, Esther. Hi, Jerry. I see I caught you loafing again. How are you? Fine. Thank you. Bye-bye. That's your lady. So that's old Esther, huh? Well, that girl Esther's a fox, ain't she? Just don't be too rough on the little girl, you hear? Who, me? Yeah, you, pussycat. "Seattle ferries. From 8:00 to 6:00." My, my. Business must be brisk. Why don't they have a boat called The Lesbian? I'm taking The Lesbian to the island. Catch you all later. What is this shit? He's going to check with the Marquis de Sade and see who we should recruit. Ida. Ida. What? There's a guy here from the government. What government? What guy? He wants to see us. I know. It's the tax. I told you you should've declared everything. You with your couple hundred dollars under the table. The cockamamie $200 didn't do it. What else is he doing here? He showed me a badge. He's waiting out there. I'll do the talking. Yeah. You talk. Okay. How are you, Ida? Please sit down. Did you you want to speak to me? I want to hire you to do a job that you both used to specialize in. You must be joking. That was years ago. I'm sorry. It's out of the question. I understand your son died just recently. Yeah. His name was Joey, wasn't it? Tell me about him, Ida. Joey? What can you say? He was a good boy. I mean, like all the kids today, he needed a haircut, a big moustache, and shabby clothes. He was a good boy... till he got on that stuff. I remember the last time I saw him. He was sitting on the chair in his room shaking and shivering, his arms wrapped around him like he was hugging himself. I asked him if I could help. It was too late. Doctor said it was narcotic debilitation. He was dead that night. Tell me something. The both of you with your background... didn't you ever think about getting even? Yeah. We both did. But we... this country gave us both a second chance, and we decided we'd never do anything wrong again. But this isn't wrong. This is for the government. We need your help. We're too old. We have grandchildren. And what about them? What happens when they grow up? Do you want them to end up like Joey? Is that what you both want? Ida? Is that what you want? No! Okay, uh... I'll see you both on the dock. Hey, man, she bought it. I did okay, huh? I think you overdid it a bit, but here's your money. You always give me the dirty work. You love it, and you know it. Who, me? You ready? Yeah. Okay, Stand by. Okay, do it. What did you put in these suitcases, gold bricks? To make matters worse, I thought I was through with boats. Look-- Another boat, and a small one. I hate the smell of fish. Will you stop talking negative already? I'll get seasick and nauseated. What an adorable boat. Look at that boat. Adorable? It's a darling boat. I throw up, I look at it. Are you all right? Can we help you? Can I help? Here's the steps. Would you like a hand? What's happening down there? I need sink plugs. The water pipe is busted. I got to get the oil changed. The head is cracked. The toilet don't flush. All that works is the anchor. I need a year to sink it. You got two days. Everybody get on board now, and get yourself unpacked. I got business, so I'll be back in a few days. That's nifty. You can't do that. I'll make my own moves. Come on. Look who just pulled in. Look who finally just got here. Better go down there right now and blast him. Go right on down there. We'll let him get in. We'll let the guy get in. They'll sit down. They'll talk. Pop. Just like that. Christ, it's cold out there. Well... what, uh... what can I do for you? My name's Nick Allen. I work for the government. Uh...owen? Allen. Allen. Well, Mr. Allen, why don't you sit down, take off your coat, get comfortable, and tell me what the government wants with me? Well, I hear you're one hell of a driver and open to any kind of job there is... no questions asked. Why don't you sit over here? We'll talk price. Uh-huh. Well, uh... If it's got four wheels... I can drive it. Now, why don't you sit right over here and I'll tell you a true story-- [gunshot] You missed him. [gunshot] [gunshots] He's getting into the goddamn van. You won't get anywhere with that. You couldn't hit an elephant from here. You can't hit the broad side of a-- Son of a bitch! [gunshot] [horn honks] [horn honks] Goddamn it! Fucking drivers. [gunshots] Look at him! He's going down the opposite way. Come on. Come on. Move, you mother. Move. Move. Goddamn it, you're losing him. [horn honks] What the hell? I don't believe that move. We're going off at the first exit. I don't believe it. I don't believe it. All right. That was nice. That was nice. We'll catch him on the other side. Right. That's right. He didn't have that much of a head start. Where is he? I told you we should've sunk him right away. Check the driveways. That's what I've been doing. See anything? No. I let you do one thing, and you blow it. One fucking thing and you blow it, man. Where is this guy? I don't believe it. Too much. Too much. Bingo! There's the truck! He ran out of gas. How do you do? [horn honks] All right. Here we go. What are you trying to do, asshole? Goddamn these drivers. They should take courses, some of 'em. I don't even know where to begin to look. He's around here. He's around somewhere here. Son of a bitch! He's in the god damn tow truck! What's wrong with my gun? He's in the tow truck. What the fuck's the matter with this gun? Goddamn fool! Christ, don't kill us both. Son of a bitch! Get on your feet, for Christ's sake, and stop playing around. Son of a bitch. Come on, for Christ's sake! We got to get moving. That's great. Let's go. There's nobody here, so let's go. Where is everybody? I don't know. Barry took everybody to town, and your whore went to town with him. What about the boat, huh? Who's going to fix it? I'm talking to you! Nick! I can't stand it anymore. I can take you. I know I can take you. [horn honks] [honk] Barry! Get back to the boat now! We're moving out. I can't talk to you right now. I can't stand this weather. [horn honks] She went... Ida went... Where's Ida? She went to mail a letter. Did something go wrong? There's trouble. Trouble. Sorry I didn't tell Mike where I was going. Everybody's here right now. My mother, it's her birthday. I can't tell you. I don't know. I don't know. Move over. I can't get in. [horn honks] Come on! Move! Where's Sherry? Where's Sherry? I don't know where she is. She went to the beauty parlor. Why didn't you let me know? Why didn't you let Mike know when you were leaving? Look out. I'll sit on your lap.

Here we go. Ida and Herman down to 64 seconds. Mike in at 35. Barry, the son of a bitch, made it in at 4 1/2. Sherry with the extra five. You and me we know. Get in. I'll show you what we're going to do. I'll arrange transportation. I got just the airline. They serve a great hamburger. Ha! Being this is our last night together before the big show, Ida and I, well, we want to-- We want to wish us all good luck and good running. Yeah. Good running, huh? That's right. I made the 10 seconds though, didn't I, Nick? Bring in the bowling ball. And the grand prize of the evening is that Nick gets to dance with the pretty... sexy... sensational... voluptuous-- Okay, Herman. Next-- Next to Ida... Sherry. Hey, what about some music? It's like a funeral here. I need a match. Who's got a match? I got a match. Let's give them a little room. Hey, Nick, is that all right? Put on some music! Man, that's not my type. Oh, good. [music plays] [motor running] Go ahead laugh now, you little turd. Go on, laugh. Come on, laugh. I'll do the best I can. Move along there now. Come on, that's the boy. Move on over there. Now that's it. That's it. Look what I found on the gravel over there by the tree. Uncle Sam badge just like the one you showed me. Though I know it's not yours 'cause it has somebody else's name on it... which means uncle sam... is after you... not me. So I guess all this jive you've been giving us is a bunch of bullshit, huh? Bullshit. So... ta-ta. They don't want to go with you, man. That's that. I want to go with you. I'm glad it ain't for the government. Up the government's ass. Yeah, all right? Nick... look, you-- You know that I believe what we're doing is right, and I still do, but I can't go against the united states government. Look, for Christ's sake, man, I'm a cop on a 30-day leave. I... I'd lose my pension, Nick. I'm sorry. Oh, Nick... if this was for Uncle Sam, then we-- We could understand, but-- Nick, you see, he served eight years already, and I served three myself. We can't do anything illegal. Okay? Please understand, Nick. Please. Hey, man, I hope they're no hard feelings. Nothing personal. How are you feeling? You don't look so good. [coughs] Give me the shit. What shit? The junk. What junk? What's that? The heroin. Heroin, heroin, heroin. Come on, stop fucking around and give me-- Give... Oh, heroin, heroin. You want some heroin. Oh, here we go. All right. Is this what you're talking about? Huh? Huh? You want your life, right? This is what keeps you alive, right? G-give it to me. Huh? Is that what you want? No, stop it! Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it. What's going on? I just threw the heroin overboard. It's not legal to have heroin on board, and since you all are concerned about legalities, then we have to be consistent. Know what that means? The chick's going to be screaming. She's going to be screaming in an hour. She's going to be in pain. She's going to be hurting. Now just get the fucking boat to the shore. Just take the boat in. That's all. Nick, you give it to her. You go get some stuff and give it to her. Nick, don't look at me like that. Go and get some stuff. Why are you concerned about this girl? Nick, I've seen what happens. You go find some stuff and give it to her. She could kill herself like that. Go find some stuff. You worried about her killing herself? I don't understand that. She's no different than any of the other junkies, thousands of them dying every single day. I can't see it again, Nick. Please. She's dead, Ida. Believe me when I tell you. Whether it's now, tomorrow, a week from now, a month from now, six months from now, a year from now-- She's dead. Go on, turn your back. Go have a cup of coffee and eggs and bacon. And, Barry, why don't you go have yourself a beer? You turn your back on all of the others. Is it because you know her? Is that why you're so concerned? Those junkies out there have people who know them, too, who love them. Just walk by like it doesn't even exist, like you've done everything else in your whole life. No. I'm going to stay here until she dies, and nobody's going to stop me. No, no, no. No, no, no. Put the fucking boat in. Nobody's going to stop me. Go on, try to stop me. Dutch, you're not going to stop me. Barry, you're not going to stop me either. Go on, try. Okay, Nick. It worked. I'm back in. You prick. Nick... Okay, Nick. Ida, I-- I'll go alone. You-- You go on home. You think I'm going to let you go to france with all those girls there alone? It's okay It's all right. Here we come, you mother... [whistle] Marseille is the oldest city in France. It dates from 600 B.C. Shows a population of 1,200,000. [car horn honks] [bells ringing] [horn blows] [music plays] Herman. Yeah? Are you sleeping? Who can sleep? You thinking about tomorrow, huh? No. I'm thinking about your mother. [telephone rings] Hello? Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Goodbye. Who's that, your boyfriend? It was Nick. He wanted to know how everything is. He wished us a good life. And it could be a short one, too. Oh, you know, Herman... I've been thinking. After 35 years... this may be the last time we'll be in a bed together. So, Ida... why waste it? [honking] [honking] [honk honks] [honk honks] Hey! Come on, Herman! Herman, come on! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ida don't feel good. We can't-- we can't go out today. I'm sorry. We're leaving Marseille at 2:30. We'll pick you up on the way back. 2:30. Okay, we'll come out at 2:30. Everybody, you have a nice time. Yeah, I hope she feels better, too. Aah! Aah. This is for Joey. Aah! Aah! [siren] [cheering] You made it. You made it. You finally made it. We had to go-- We had to go shopping. We did a little shopping. We didn't think you'd ever get here. I picked up a few souvenirs-- Four or five things. 4 or 500 things. I got all mixed up with the money, the francs and the marks. I couldn't figure. [siren] [gunshot] [horn honks] [siren] Aah! [telephone rings] [coughing] [gasping] Hey, what's the matter with you? We're going to make it, okay? [siren] Am I going to go through with the other hits? Shit, you can do it,mama. I can't. I don't like killing people. You got to, baby. Don't worry about it. Everything's working all right. I'm not going to do it. Just take it easy. Ain't nothing to it. Killing some pigs. That's all. Aren't you scared? Scared? Fuck, no. I'm supernigger. I'm scared. If you think you got troubles, nigger. I lost another fucking spear. It cost me 47 box tops. I saved for six months. Shit. Don't tell me that shit. Had a gold tip on it and everything. Gosh, gee willikers, Mr. Bumps. You a ugly bitch when you cry, did you know that? No. Look at that face. Oh, my God. I can't. Oh, don't, please. I can't do it, you know. Oh, my God. You want to look like that the rest of your life? You be all right, mama. Don't worry. Everything's working out mellow. Chicago. Oh, Chicago. The Windy City. Yes. Very cold. [gasps] [siren] Everything go okay? Okay. All right. What do you think happened to Nick? Best thing is not to think about it at all. It's 12 hours to the border. Let's go. Goodbye, Marseille. [siren] Sure is an advantage to having worked with someone, isn't it, Nick? Who else would figure you'd have the nerve to head for the nearest border just like that? Oh, gee. I'd have thought you'd have forgotten about Damascus way back in '68. That's your mistake, Nick. Somebody inside'd like to see you, an old friend of yours. Why don't you drive right into the courtyard? All right. Hey, listen, you ought to be very careful with that thing. You might hurt yourself. Right on, brother. Bonjour, amigo. Get out of that car, s'il vous plait. Just like old home week, isn't it? Well, I guess I owe you an apology, Nick. You pulled it off just like you said you would. I got to hand it to you. Got all your people out. Oh, come on. Come on, Nick. Let me buy you a drink. Salud. All right, Nick. I'll make it nice and neat. I've got a little bit of a hairy situation here. The French government is convinced that our government was in on it with the job you pulled off. I've been trying to explain it to them. They're not buying it on two counts-- They're convinced you're one of my men, and they can't believe that only seven people executed a job like that. If I were them, I wouldn't believe it either. So the heat's on me, and I got to take it off. I figured out a nice little deal for the both of us. Your part is simple. All you have to do is agree with them. You did have outside help, but it wasn't us. We'll make it a large French syndicate, okay? Don't worry about the details. My people will make up a story the French will buy-- Oh, a year of training, 100 or more people behind you, unlimited financial support, that kind of thing. Now that'll get the French off my back, and then I'll get off yours, and that'll also get you off scot-free... with a new identity, passport, and enough money in Switzerland to live for the rest of your life. Now, that's not a bad deal, huh? Sir, I'm surprised you could think that, and I'm surprised at all the bullshit you've been handing me. I mean, you're not worried about the French government. You're worried about the people back home, and what might happen hen they get the word and find out how easy it was to pull the whole thing off. Some of them might even want to try it themselves. Isn't that what you're worried about? Okay, you're right. Well, now, let's just take a look at the first hijacking. Look what that started. And that's why I didn't walk into anything. That's why you got to keep me alive to make sure that nobody finds out the truth about what really happened. Okay, Nick. You're calling the shots. It's your ball game. What do you want? Anarchy? I want the government to get off their fucking ass. All right, Nick. You got it. I spoke to Washington this morning, and after what you've done, they're going to get off their ass. Okay, good. And then I'll come back home, and I'll tell any story you want me to tell. Great, Nick. But then the action starts. Now, look, Nick, you've got a problem-- you don't hear too well. I just offered you one hell of a proposition. I just offered you one hell of a proposition. You want to turn me down? Okay. I can kill you, Nick, and I can come up with a cover story... before you're cold. Yeah... I guess you could do that. You could do that. A tout a l'heure.
