Do you recognize this man as Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jones? Yes. What was your, uh, relationship with the deceased? - He was my Avon lady. - Oh, give me a break. Give me a break. You think this is a thrilling morning for me? Huh? Eat an Egg McMuffin and look at a dead guy? - Look, honey, I, I-- - Hey, I'm not your honey. It's Belinda. As a matter of fact, it's Ms. Keaton. Ha ha ha, are you listening to this? - Hmm? - She's a whore. - Hello. - Ha...hi. 'And this guy here was her pimp.' And he wasn't paying off somebody like he was supposed to so somebody made him kiss the sidewalk. - Can I close the drawer now? - Sure. Thank you. Alright, now, can you tell me who sent him to pimp heaven? Oh, sure, now can you kiss my ass? For how much? Is someone going to pick up Mr. Jones? 'Cause we sure could use the space. You got it, sport. Sir, could you sign right here? - Um, excuse me? - Yeah. Franklin once told me that he wanted to be buried in his car. - We don't do that. - Oh. You'd probably have to call the, uh, funeral home or the Department of Motor Vehicles. - Don't I know you? - Uh, no. Umm. Yeah, I do. I do. No. Um, I couldn't. I wouldn't. I'm engaged. Uh, here's a picture of my fiance, Charlotte. Well, the picture doesn't do her justice. She's suffering from water build-up. Hey, I thought I knew you. Lot of guys have my face. This is my mom. - You okay, Chuck? - Yeah. Thanks for waiting around. - I'm gonna take off, alright. - See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Hi, Mr. Carboni. Hey, ain't you going home, Chuck? Oh, Hector's an hour late. It's seven o'clock. Well, uh, Hector's been transferred. Oh, you're getting a new night man? Yeah, well, not exactly. Starting tomorrow you're going on night shift, Chuck. Night shift? I started on night shift. I'm here six years. I'm thought I was getting a raise. You going to make trouble about this? No. I just didn't-- Are you going to go over my head? Night shift? Hey, Chuckie, baby. Chuckie! Come on, night shift's better, huh. There's no supervisors around. You practically run the place. You like to read, it's quiet here at night. It's quiet here during the day, sir. Good. It's settled. See you tomorrow night. You'll be breaking in a new partner.. ...a Bill something or other. - Mr. Carboni. - Huh? - Who has my job? - Oh, uh.. Right here. It's right on here. - Mr. Carboni. - Huh? He seems to have the same last name you do. Oh, yeah, I-I think he's my nephew. I-I'll see you, Chuck. Well, that's just wonderful. And what am I supposed to be doing every night while you're working? - I'll be home days. - I work days. - All normal people work days. - Should I have quit? Want me to go right down there-- Why are you asking me, Chuck? I don't know why you work there in the first place. Your mother says you're a financial wizard. Why do you listen to my mother? This is the same woman who goes to a seance every Friday night since my father died just so she can still yell at him. How long will you be on there? - Until the wedding. - That's 9 months. Don't you want me to look good? I think you look good now. And I think you're the sweetest man in the world. Come here. Ow! Wait up, man. Hey, wait up. Every day. (female #2) 'You're going the wrong way.' 'Oh, my God.' - Are you the night guy? - Yes. Oh, hi. How you doing? I'm Leonard Carboni. What a pleasure to meet you, Leonard. - How was your first day? - Shitty. - Lot of paperwork and stuff. - I see. But Uncle Sal said you'd straighten it all out. Fine. ♪ Jumpin jack flash ♪♪ Hi. How are you doing? I'm Bill Blazejowski. You call me Billy Blaze. You must be Chuck, right? Nice shoes. Hey, this is alright. Guess this is where I'm gonna be working. I'm your new partner. Ha ha ha, whew! Swish! Ah, they're going crazy in the arena! 'They can't believe it. It's unbelievable.' This is great. What's our job? We, like, drive around pick up stiffs, or what? 'Is that what we're supposed to do?' Hey, Chuck, who's this? Wife? - Uh, fiance. - Ah. Nice frame. Yeah, okay, we can make stuff, we can read, coffee. This is great. I like it. You wondering why I carry this tape recorder? It's to tape things. See, I'm an idea man, Chuck, alright? 'I get ideas all day long. 'I can't control them.' It's like they come charging in and I.. ...I can't even fight them, if I want to, you know? Ah! So, I say 'em in here and that way I never forget them. See what I'm saying? Okay, here's an example. Watch out. Stand back. This is Bill. Idea to eliminate garbage. Edible paper. See? Eat it, it's gone. Eat it, it's out of there. No garbage. I got everything in here. Business ideas, inventions musicals, there are a couple of musicals in here. Would you like to see the rest of the office? Yeah. Hey, you want a snickers? - No, thank you. - It's not frozen. - 'My refrigerator broke.' - I understand. - Where you from, Chuck? - I'm from Cleveland. Well, I'm originally from Seattle but I just came here from Cleveland. - And, this is our lab. - Yeah, it's nice. Get this. I'm living with this chick, right? I come home one night, I catch her in bed with another girl. I was "No," I couldn't believe it, you know. She went lesbo on me like that. Unbelievable. I just finish eating my dinner. I walk right outta there. - What you think, was I wrong? - Oh, that's very personal.. What's in here, just stiffs and stuff? - Huh, no, we call them corpses. - Can I take a peek? - Sure. - Alright. - I think this one is-- - Hey, this Carboni guy. What's he like our boss, or what? No, no, he's the supervisor. He's not here at night. No, get out of town! Just you and me and the stiffs alone here? That's gonna be radical, Chuck! That guy's dead! - Charlotte? - 'Yes?' You've been in there half an hour. Are you okay? - 'I'm fat.' - You're not fat. - 'I'm fat!' - This is my one night off. I look forward to this all week. Why don't you come to bed? 'I just wanna lose six more pounds.' Tonight? Why don't you run into bed? Maybe you'll lose some pounds along the way. 'Alright, Chuck. Just don't look at me.' - Okay. - 'Are the lights out?' - Yeah. - 'Are the lights out, Chuck?' Yes. Yes! - Could you close the drapes? - Sure. Could you just check the apartment? Why do I have to check the apartment every time? Choo-choo, please, if you check the apartment, then I can relax. Okay. 'Ha! Nobody here!' Grrr. Are-are you excited? Like the French when Lindbergh landed. - Am I fat? - Uh-uh! - Am I fat? - You're a willow. You're a reed. You're Audrey Hepburn. - Chuck? - You're not fat. - That music. - What music? - That music. - What music? Chuck! It's just a little loud music. Well, it bothers me. You see, you let too many things bother you that way you'll never have an org-- Don't you say that word! It's silly. I'm-I'm sorry. (male #3) 'Who the hell is that?' - Did you knock on that door? - Uh.. - Well? - Mistake. It's a very big mistake. (female #3) 'Luke, who is it?' Some dwarf. - Thank you. - What's taking so long? Is he going to stop playing that awful music? - We were just getting to that-- - What's she mean "awful music?" Awful good. She meant awful good. Uh, Luke, why don't, uh, why don't you go back inside? I'll be right in. Okay? Go play with your rope. Don't be long now. Sorry. We'll, uh, we'll keep it down, okay? I knew I recognized you! Last week at the morgue, remember? I knew I recognized you. I'd probably seen you in the building when I moved in. - You live here? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, but don't worry. Luke is leaving town tomorrow with the rodeo and I, uh, hardly ever do business up here. What kind of business are they doing? - Uh, she sells cowboy hats. - The man was in his underwear. And, uh, cowboy underwear. Belinda, come on, darlin'. Haul it in here now. Oh, okay. I'll be right in. I've gotta go. We'll keep it down. See you around, neighbor. Well, I took care of that. Let's go back inside. I think I should go home. Why? They said they'll keep it down. When did you get fully dressed? It wasn't going to be any good tonight, anyway. I feel so guilty. I cheated today. - You're kidding. - I had a Nestle's Crunch bar. Food. I feel like dirt. I'm really sorry, Chuck. No one else would be this patient with me. I-I'll see you next Sunday. (Bill) 'Hey, Chuck, food came.' 'You owe me $3.' 'Chuck, I'm really getting good at remembering these cards.' 21. Gee. Well, I tell you, Chuck. This weekend is it. This weekend, I go to Atlantic City and I do nothing but play blackjack straight through. I'm not even gonna get a room. I'm just gonna get those wash 'n drys, you know. Did I tell you I thought of them first? Only they already had 'em. Twenty one. What's the matter? Oh, I ordered egg salad. They sent me tuna fish. Every night, they send you the wrong food and you eat it. Send it back. Get what you want. They get angry if you complain. You know, that's alright. The chef has a lot on his mind. Like what, curing cancer? Hmm. Wait a minute. Hold the phone. I got it. Oh, you're going to cure cancer. No. Tuna fish. What if you mix mayonnaise right in the can with the tuna fish? Hold it. Hold it. Wait a minute, Chuck. Take live tuna fish and feed them mayonnaise. Oh, this is good. Call Starkist. This is great. Wall Street Journal? What do you read this for? What's the matter with The Enquirer? Oh, that interests me. I used to be an investment counselor. - No kidding? - Yeah. - What's that? - Uh, it's like a stockbroker. So, uh, what are you doing babysitting stiffs? Are you a drinker, big drinker? 'No.' Ah, toothead, doper, nose candy, coke? - No. - Come on. That's a very rough job. I would shape up a deal over two months and another man would come right in and take all the credit. I just needed a place that was quiet, that's all. I'm in a transitional period. Eh, what kind of a paper is this? There's no sports, there's no comics, there's no Ann Landers. - 'Hello.' - Yes? Can I help you? Yes, um, I'm looking for a Mr. Blazejowski. Yea-hoo! Hey. - I-I'm, I'm Jefferey Durkin. - You sure are. How you doing, Jeff? You got money for me? Some Cash? Do-re-mi? - Yeah, 20 bucks, right? - Twenty bucks. Thanks. Ha. Hey, listen wait outside while I'm getting the car, alright? - Sure. - Alright, bud. There you go. Nice tux. Good fit. I don't want to be a buttinsky but what exactly is going on? I dunno, some kind of debutante ball out on the island. Kid wants me to take him and his girlfriend. And you're gonna take one of the morgue vehicles? Yeah, it's a limo, right? - It's a limo for dead people. - Did you see that kid? Wait a minute, are you telling me that every night you leave here, this is what you do? No, not every night. There's not a debutante ball every night. I do weddings, or bar mitzvahs or just get down and cruise the airport. The other night, picked up these Japanese guys.. ...$400 from the airport to the UN. Diplomats! You're ripping off diplomats. Here. It's a $100. - What is this for? - 'Okay, big time, let's roll.' 'Rock n roll.' - Uh, Bill? - 'Ha?' What happens if we get a call you know, if we have to go and pick up a body? Hey, I'll be back. What's the matter, by the time I get there they won't be dead anymore? Hey, kid, you like music? - Sure. - Good. ♪ Jumpin' jack flash He's a ga gas gas ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪♪ 'Okay, Hoppy. Lead the way.' 'Oh, Pebbles. Daddy's home.' 'Oh, no, no. Back, boy. Back, boy.' 'Down, boy. Down, boy.' - Good evening, Leonard. - Oh, hi, Mr. Lumley. Oh, that Barney Rubble. What an actor! Oh, listen, we got some bodies in the wrong drawers but Uncle Sal said-- I would straighten it out. Goodnight, Mr. Lumley. ♪ Flintstone Meet them Flintstone ♪ ♪ They're the modern stone-age family ♪ ♪ From the town of Bedrock ♪ ♪ They're a page right out of history ♪♪ "Name of the deceased. Something Polish." Hi, Chuck. Hey, just saw that jerky Leonard kid. How come we don't have TV? - Want to hear about my weekend? - No. You know, I've been working on my blackjack system, right? Alright, so...I get down to Atlantic City this weekend. And I'm sitting in the casino with my wash 'n drys. Did I tell you I had the idea for them, first? Anyway I was sitting there and playing blackjack, right? They bar me. They bar me. I'm out. I'm barred. I can't get in now. Right? You know why? - Being too good a player. - How much did you win? Well, you know, I was down a couple of hundred but they could tell I was good, you know. They looked at me. And they threw me out. They barred me. So, they start dealing me off the bottom. I can tell when they do that. So I get up and I yelled at the dealer, right. So, he goes over to the pit boss. So, I threw my complimentary worned out drink right in his fat face. So they barred me for being too good a player. Think I'll go to Vegas next week. I wish you would shut up. Vegas knows how to treat you right, you know, Chuck. 'Cause its got broads, you know, Wayne Newton. Got him. He's an Indian. Did you know that? Would you do me a favor. Would you please shut up? - You telling me to shut up? - I'm telling you to shut up. I'm.. I'll tell your recorder, so that you don't forget. Hello. This is Chuck, to remind Bill to shut up! You know, this used to be such a quiet place before you got here. You talk too much. Edible paper, feeding mayonnaise to tuna fish. I will give you a quarter if you just stop talking. Thank you. I thought we were friends. (male voice on recorder) 'Hello, this is Chuck' 'to remind Bill to shut up!' 'Hello, this is Chuck' 'to remind Bill to shut up!' 'Hello, this is Chuck' 'to remind Bill to shut up!' 'Bill to shut up!' 'Hello, this is Chuck' 'to remind Bill to shut up!' 'Bill to shut up!' 'To shut up!' 'Shut up!' - Sorry that I yelled at you. - 'To shut..' You think it's been easy on me? I come in here, I'm the new guy with no friends. I confide in you my whole life. I tell you my deepest, most intimate stuff. You share anything with me? I see a picture of your fiance, every day. You didn't even tell me her name. - Gave you $100. - I didn't ask for it. That's what made it such a beautiful gesture on my part. Never mind, forget it. We'll work together every night like strangers. That's fine with me. Charlotte. What? My fiance's name is Charlotte. Oh, my God. Oh, hi, Chuck. What happened, did you fall down? Did somebody hit you? It's the other way around. Somebody hit me and then I fell down. Wish I had my handkerchief, I always have my handkerchief-- Uh, I got a tissue in my purse. No, no, no, no. Please, let me do it. Hi, listen, do you have a handkerchief? - Mugger! Mugger! - No, I need your handkerchief. No! Oh, no, no. No! Thank you. You know, this was the first time I was ever beaten up by a bunch of Bluebells. I didn't like it. How are you? Oh, I'm great. Four pounds of make up, they'll never know the difference. Can I ask you a question? I wouldn't do it with the guy until he...paid me. So...he beat me up. That's what happens when you don't have a pimp. Some guys figure why should they pay? That guy in the morgue, he was your pimp, right? Yeah A lot of Franklin's ladies are in the same boat. We could find another pimp, but.. ...some of those guys are real rough. Get the girls hooked on dope. Drugs or beat-up, it's a nice choice. You could do something different, you're very bright. Is head okay, because, uh.. ...I'm real tired. Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. Thanks very much. I hope everything turns out alright. - See you in the halls. - Yeah. Ouch! (Chuck) 'Go back home. No, no!' So she was just lying there in the elevator? She was all beat up. See, that's why they have pimps. You know, that's what she said. She knows this whole bunch of girlfriends that need pimps. I really hope they find someone trustworthy. - Ha ha ha, are you crazy? - No. Those guys are killers. They're animals. They dress nice though. Wait a minute. Hold the phone, Chuck. We got all that space down at the morgue. All those cars, all that time at night, nobody watchin' us. We could handle things for your next-door neighbor and all her girlfriends right out of the morgue! Pimps? Are you saying we should become pimps? "Pimps" is an ugly word. We could call ourselves "lovebrokers." This is my stop, you think about it, okay? I really think this is the one, Chuck. I am excited about this, I mean it. This is it, I think. Lovebrokers. Lovebrokers, ha ha ha. You and me, buddy! You're over the rainbow, pal. Lovebrokers. - Hi, Chuck. - Hi. Uh, listen, last week, when you helped me I think I got a little rude right before you left. Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, no. Well, anyway. Um. I noticed that you and I come home from work at the same time every day. I thought maybe we might start having breakfast together. You got any eggs? I practically have a whole dairy in here. Great. Ah, gee, your place is beautiful! And it's warm! My place is freezing. And you got a kitchen, huh? And you got eggs. Uh, how do you like your eggs? - Uh, scrambled. - Of course! - Men love scrambled. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. - Men love scrambled. Oh! Chuck, does the window open? Oh, no, I-I'm real sorry, it's painted shut. Makes sense, doesn't it? That's where the fire escape is. Is there a-a vent or a fan or anything? Oh, no, I'm real sorry, that room just catches all the heat in the morning. It's okay. Well, you know, it's worse in the summer. My God! Uh, I'll put my robe back on. Uh, no, no, don't. Uh, what I mean is.. ...that you should be comfortable. Uh, I am. Okay. I'll get that. It's probably for me. Hello. Charlotte. Why'd you call me? What's the matter? You ate what? Well, that's okay, just don't do it again. 'What do you mean, what am I doing?' 'I'm not doing anything.' Well, of course I sound strange if you call me up early in the morning and you say what am I doing and I'm not doing anything. Oh, my God. I just stepped on a tack. Yeah. I love you too. Eggs comin' right up. You know, I was thinking about the last time that we were together. And I was wondering.. ...have-have you been able to find, you know, a, um.. - A pimp? - Yeah. No. I have to, though. - This way's too dangerous. - Yeah. - Lupe, she's my friend. - Yeah. She got her arm broke last week. What a sick world! Yeah. Thank God. You know, we could do this every morning. At least until you get tired of eggs. Boy, it is hot in here. You got any bread? I'm sorry, I must've left my money at home. It's in my other pants, I think. There you go. $4.90 of $5? Keep the dime, it's alright. I'll take these. Come on. - They gave me the wrong bread. - Ah? I asked for for wheat, they gave me white. So send it back. Hey, you gave him white bread. No, don't make a fuss, don't make a fuss. My mother said, you send it back, the chef spits on it. - Really? - Turkey, turkey! Come get your turkeys. (Bill) 'Immoral?' What do you mean, immoral? As a matter of fact, prostitution is probably one of the most moral things in the world. How did you figure that out? Simple. You take a guy. He's in from out of town. Let's say that guy. 'Okay, he's in from out of town and he's here on business.' Alright, he's waiting for his wife, and two or three children. Hey, he's got urges, alright. Let's say he goes in to see this picture. Which, by the way, is not a bad movie. Anyway, let's say this picture stimulates his, uh.. Urges. Good word. Alright. Now, he's on the street again, right? Okay, he is a loaded pistol. He's like Mount St. Helens, alright. Who walks by, but a Girl Scout swinging her cookies? Her little cookies. Girl Scouts of America he goes bananas, he's on her like mud on a pig. That wouldn't have happened if he'd gone to a hooker, right? So, you call that moral? He goes jumps on a Girl Scout and breaks her cookies, you call that moral? You figured that all out just by yourself? I have that kind of mind, yeah. Yes, you do, Bill. Yes, you do. So let's do it! Okay now? Yeah, nice. But isn't this a little high, Angelo? That's the way I always do it. - You like it that way. - I do? - Yeah. - Yeah, alright, I do. - Hi! How you doin'? - Hi. Alright. Hey, Chuck, what are you, like, getting a haircut? No, I just like wearing sheets. Hey, look at this, what'd I tell you? "Girl Scout attacked." In the paper, right there. - Could I see that again? - Yeah. Right there. "Girl Scout attacked." "Girl Scout attacked by dog." "Dog." A guy from out of town, what's the difference, Chuck? There's a very big difference. One carries an attache case, the other urinates on a tree. Hey, what are you doin' here? What is this? A haircut? You call that.. Look at these sideburns. Even them out! Man's gonna have a razor in his hands, let us not get him angry. Chuck, I know, but you've got a sideburn up here. - Another down Fort Lauderdale. - He is a seasoned professional. Do you want your friend Belinda working for one of those animals? You want her to be, what, Ms. Heroin, 1982? Charlotte's parents are coming in for Thanksgiving. I really need to get this haircut. Oh, yeah. You know. You know. Yeah, that's it. Get the haircut. Get all your hair cut. All you ever think about is yourself. You don't care about what happens to me. You don't care what happens to Belinda. You don't care what happens to the Girl Scouts of America! America! I'm fed up, man. I'm fed up with you. I wash my hands and my feet of you. Trim that! (Chuck) 'Mr. and Mrs. Koogle, would you care for a drink?' Mrs. Koogle and I do not drink. Of course. So, how do you like our fair city? Oh, we don't. Well, perhaps if you drank, you would. Mom? Is dinner almost ready? Turkey's almost dead. Hello. Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. - Arrested? - Chuck, I'm really sorry. I-I called the landlady and she wasn't home. They've taking me into night court, and all my ID, and all my money are in my apartment. (both women) Oh, beautiful. Belinda. This is not a good evening for me. My entire family is here for Thanksgiving. Chuck, please! Franklin used to take care of all these things. I don't know what they're gonna do to me. Okay. Okay. Don't cry. I'll be there as soon as I can get there. Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Have you seen the lights out at night? No wonder this city's going broke. Ha ha ha ha. I have to go out, and I'll be back in a minute, okay? What? Where're you going? You absolutely didn't have to come with me. I would've been home in 10 minutes. Well, we had the rental car, paid an arm and a leg for it. Might as well use it. You wanna 'scuse me, sonny. I wanna know why she called you. She's my neighbor. Excuse me. (Judge) 'Uh, next case.' That's his neighbor. Belinda Keaton, you are charged with prostitution and assault. Not guilty, Your Honor. - Not guilty? - Not guilty. Not guilty? Your Honor, this woman's a menace. Uh, you are one Howard, uh, Pelekoudas? Yes, sir. I'm the victim. You're an asshole. Be that as it may, uh, can we proceed? Mr. Pelekoudas and I had just completed a business transaction at which point, Mr. Pelekoudas attempted to forcibly exact a refund when services had already been rendered. - Tried to grab his money back. - Yeah. Yes, that's when she assaulted me. Mr. Pelekoudas, uh, you look unmarked, undamaged to me in any manner. Oh, yeah? Well, feast your eyes on this. (Howard) 'Exhibit A! She bit me!' What about my feelings? 'What about my feelings?' You wanna know what really steams my bean? They let that strumpet right back out on the street. You're moving outta that building. Absolutely. Why are you friends with that girl? She's my neighbor. She happens to be a very nice girl. Oh, but she's a Harlot. - Now wait a minute-- - You stay out of it. Let me tell you something, Charlotte. When you get married, you're going to have to handle him just the way I handled his father. (Mr. Koogle) Damn potholes. You alright, Rose? If it wasn't for me, his father would have done any old thing he pleased. You know what he wanted to do? Make furniture. By hand! Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Koogle, I straightened out Al and together, we'll all straighten out Chuck. (Mr. Koogle) 'You alright, Rose?' Bill? - Bill? - Hey, my bud! I have to tell you something very important. Come on in. How'd you get in, Chuck? This is a, uh, security building. I'm gonna have to talk to that guy. (Bill screaming) 'Yeeaah, way to go!' What are we really talking about here? Huh? What's the essence...of what we're talking about? I'll spell it out for you if I have to. Prostitution! Prostitution. Hey, we can say it. We're big kids now, right? You know, a lot of times it'll help you to understand a word if you break it down. So let's do that now, shall we? "Pros." Doesn't mean anything. Forget about that. "Tit." I think we all know what that means. "Tu." Okay, "tu." And "tion," of course, from the, um, Latin.. ..."to shun." Say, "No. Uh-uh. Thank you anyway, I don't want it." "To push away." Doesn't even belong in this word, really so let's get rid of that. You know, um.. ...if I could take a moment here, uh.. ...and I mean this, what I'm about to say. I feel a lot of love in this room. I don't know, maybe it's me, but I'll you something it was here a minute ago. And, uh, it was really beautiful. So at this moment I think it's important that I see all of your breasts. Or I don't have to. I don't see your breasts. Come on, let's get out of here, this guy's no pimp, he's a wimp. Hey, come on, you guys. Give him a chance, come back! Is this a joke? You're missing "The Donahue Show." I had you on "The Donahue Show," booked! Chuck? You've gotta tell 'em. Now, just tell 'em like you told me. How would you ladies like to earn ten times the amount of money you earn now? I'm not kidding. Ten times the amount of money that you earn right now. You wanna use the blackboard?

Saint Chuck. Well, not just for that. You're nice. Decent. You think I'm decent? Do you remember the first time you made me eggs in my apartment? 'And you took off your robe?' My eyes had a heart attack. And every time after that it didn't matter what you were wearing you could have worn a suit of armor I got hot and crazy. There's your Saint Chuck. It's 30 degrees in here, and I am sweating. I think we'll skip the coffee, I'm sober. - Chuck! - Yeah? I'm sober too, and I have to talk to you. - What about? - About this. You're a very good talker. - Chuck. - Huh? The zipper's on the side, honey. - I got it. - Mm-hmm. Want to know something funny? - What? - I don't smoke. Did you ever see the movie "Klute?" What? The movie with Jane Fonda. "Klute." No, I don't think so. - She plays a call girl. - Mm-hmm. And she's with this guy you know, a customer. And they're doing it and she's screaming and moaning as if it's like the end of the world for her. Then right in the middle, when the guy's not looking she looks at her watch and you just know it's an act. - Hey. - Hm? I don't wear a watch. Where have you been? We moved. William, it's so nice to see you at 9:00 this evening. You drunk from last night? Drunk, yes, but not from wine. - Beer? - 'Ha ha ha ha!' What's the matter with you? You're three hours late. It's been mayhem in here. I got stiffs coming in, I got girls going out. Where's Belinda? She hasn't checked in. I would not count on Belinda coming back to work. What's the matter? What happened? Is she alright? Somebody roughed her up? Nobody roughed her up. Will you put away your muscles? Bill, something happened last night. Something passed between us. Her life couldn't possibly be the same. Hi, Bill. Sorry I'm late. Hi, Chuck. Remember that guy Schizelman? He called and wants to meet you. Oh. Yeah. He's nice. What are you doing? What do you mean what she's doing? She's working. Is that true? Yeah. Really? I have to earn a living, right? You told me this morning that you weren't faking. - I wasn't faking. - Faking what? Please, Bill. Get out of town! You two guys? Can I please have a conversation with her? You haven't quit? - How can I quit? - Very simply. You open your mouth and you say, "Bill, Chuck, I quit." Okay. Then what do I do? No, I mean it, Chuck. Where do I go from there? What happens to me? What happens to you is.. I can't get over the fact that you didn't quit. Right! I didn't quit! Did you quit? I'm not a whore. - No. You're a pimp. - Hey, guys, come on. Now, let's stop before we all say something we regret. Shut up! I need a ride. I have to drive her. Fine. You gonna be alright? Hey, you know us pimps. Fine. Okay, I need the car keys. You got them? Thank you. I got them. Look, he didn't mean what he said. Yes, he did. No, he's, he's a strange guy.

I'll come back later, bring him a bottle, get him drunk. Take off his clothes. In the morning, he'll think you were there. No problem. City morgue. Somebody died? Who cares? 'Hi.' Why did you lock the door? It's okay. Sirs.. At least Franklin paid off regular for two years until he got stupid. You never even sent us a nickel. Not one nickel. - I don't know-- - "I don't, I don't know." If we came to us up front, we could've worked something out. But now it's too late. We're angry. We're insulted.
