[This is where the story begins.] [The man who's walking, well... the young man who's walking, that's me.] [So, I'm the main character of this story.] [No, no, we're not going to begin the story here...] [Instead, we're going to begin the story...] [Here, that would be nice... here.] [The young woman who is walking is my girlfriend.] [No, no, no no, uh...] [we're not going to begin the story here, we're going to instead begin it...] [Well, we're going to begin it again here.] [This is OK.] [I'd prefer to start here.] [Very well... very very well.] Yes? Who is it? It's Cl?ment. [Oh yes, my name is Cl?ment.] [I'm very glad my parents gave me this first name.] [I think it's simple and not too common.] Dad? Dad! How are you? Hello dad. You're looking stylish, wearing all white clothes. Yes I didn't have anything else to wear. Be careful not to stain it! I'll still greet you. So you wanted to tell me something? Yes, let's have a seat. Is everything OK? Yes, dad. I'm ready to hear what you wanted to say. How old are you now? You don't know how old I am? Of course I do, but answer me. Because I'd wanted to begin like this. I'm 25 years old, dad. You know I'm your father. Yes, dad. And I assure you... I'm very happy to be your father. I'm saying this because it should be said every now and then. I don't know how to say it but... With the books that I've read, and a bit of reflection... To be a father... is not an easy role. We can be misunderstood, we can be misjudged for something we've done. Excuse me, dad. Constance? How are you? Oh you're in Marseilles? That's great! Ah you want me to show you around the city? Today? Tomorrow. OK, that's fine. Excuse me, but I'm with someone right now could you give me your phone number? OK, 04... I'm going remember it. 04... 91... 08... 34... OK, that's fine. Take care. Bye. 04.91.08.34.20 Sorry about that, dad. It was a friend of mine from Paris. As you were saying... What I wanted to say is that there is going to be day when... I'm not going to give you any more money. Really? Yes. But, when? I don't know, I have to think about it a little bit. But I can assure you, it won't be right away! Well OK then. This doesn't scare you? Of course it does a little bit. You know, I'm doing this for your own good. You see the state of deterioration these days in the relationship between father and son. I wanted to do something positive, especially... since I'm in the middle of reading... a book on psychology relating to this it's very interesting. Victor, I can't find my tennis racket. We just brought it back, sir, this morning. It was just strung, I'll get it for you. Hello, Cl?ment. Hello. I don't live with my father because of his professional obligations. I live with my mother, but... I don't really need to introduce her because... she has nothing to do with this story. So instead we're going to continue this story... Here. This place is called the Bay of Monkeys. I come here often because I find this place to be exotic. It makes me completely forget about the city. But here we're still in Marseilles, isn't that crazy? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just looking at you. Oh look! Right there. Do you see that guy walking next to the woman? I've seen him several times here, he's never with the same woman. - Really? - Yes. I think that's cool. Tell me, there's something I wanted to ask you... What is it? Why is it that ever since we've known each other you always wear pajamas? I don't know. I'd prefer not to wear nightshirts! No what I meant was... Why don't you walk around completely naked when I'm with you? I don't know I never really think of doing it. Why don't you ever think of it? I never really thought about it. And if you thought about it right now, what would you think? I don't know. Listen... It's not possible to not know. Do you wear your pajamas because you get cold easily. No. Then, is it because you're ashamed? No. Well in that case, it could be a psychological issue. If it's a psychological issue, it's necessary that you resolve it, you know? Who said that it's completely necessary to resolve psychological issues? Freud. - He said that? - Yes. You know all the boyfriends of my girlfriends walk around naked with them. Yes, yes, I promise. You're not normal. - Is that so? - Yes. Unless it's because of me that you've got an issue? Maybe you don't trust me? Of course I do. Then what am I doing wrong? Nothing! What would I have to do? Nothing! Perhaps I just don't feel like getting completely naked! I want to see you naked right now! No, listen... The more you try to force things, the less I'll want to do them. But it's also important that I express my desires to you. Yes, but it doesn't do any good to fight against the way things are. I'm not fighting against the way things are, I'm fighting so that things will happen. You can't just let things happen naturally? Oh, but I'm being very natural. - No you aren't. - Yes I am. - No you aren't. - Yes I am. No, because if it was really natural, you would appreciate things... moment by moment, the fact that we're both here having a good time. Instead of that, you're in your head. Yes, but I'm very naturally in my head. I can't wait for you to start working. You know that I saw my father? He's going to cut off my money supply... and I'm going to have to start working. Great! How is that great? Great! Now we will be able to live together! Why? If you're making your own living, we'll be able to live together, won't we? And, it's probably because we don't live together that you don't walk around naked. You know I'm not sure if I'll make enough money. I work too, and we won't get a large place at first. OK? Um... I don't know. You don't want for us to live together? Well uh... not right away. I'm not telling you this to annoy you, but... I don't want to wait for this forever. Listen, I'm here. I'm right here. Constance? Yes. OK, fine. Uh... yes, I don't know, wherever you want. I'd recommend Callelongue "Callelongue", just like it sounds. OK. So tomorrow at 2 P.M. Very well then. Very well, perfect. You too. Bye. Cl?ment, I can assure you that this all came very naturally into my head. What? - Let's make a deal. - A deal? Yes. We'll set a time to meet tomorrow. If we come, then it's so that we can live together. If not, then we won't see each other ever again. OK, now I can't tell if you're joking. Look at my face right now, look very carefully... do I look like I'm joking? In any case it would do us both well... to take 24 hours to think about our relationship. I hope you know that you're blackmailing me? Yes, but it's very spontaneous. Well actually, I think it's pretty artificial. Let's say that it's naturally artificial. Look, over there, we'll plan to meet over there. tomorrow at around 8:00 P.M. I have a mosquito bite that won't stop itching. Stop itching, that makes it worse. Did you notice I'm all in white clothing and I haven't gotten a stain? - Hey! - Hello. Did I scare you? No, no definitely not! - Are you well? - Yes, and you? This is my cousin, Libert?. - Hello. - Hello. That wouldn't bother you if she stayed with us a little? No, not at all! That's funny, you have a cousin in Marseilles and you've never visited the city? I only recently learned that she was my cousin. Because my father discovered relatively late that his own father had an illegitimate son. And this is my cousin! So now you're my guide, tell me everything! Well, what do you want me to tell you? For example, why is this place called Cal? Longue? It's Callelongue. So... "Cale"... is from "calanque" (a rocky inlet) and "Longue" (long) is because it starts over there and there's a long passage that continues until over there. Ah. It's pretty isn't it? - You know, we're still in Marseilles! - Really? Isn't that crazy?! [Usually when I give people a tour of Marseilles...] [I show these little houses because...] [because I like them a lot. I think they're popular.] [And I can see myself here when I'm much older.] These houses are so pretty, I think they're popular. And I can see myself here when I'm much older. Are they expensive? - They aren't cheap. - Oh really? But it's difficult to get one because they're passed on through families. Ah, sort of like the Mafia? And what is that over there? - I think it's a cave. - Shall we go there? - You want to go? - Oh yes, I love caves. - But it's a bit of walk - Is it nice? I don't know, I've never been there. - Why is it called La Grotte Rolland (Roland's Cave)? - I don't know. I'd guess whoever discovered it was named Roland. Well I certainly wouldn't name my child Roland. - Are you pregnant? - No. How are things going with Eric? We broke up two weeks ago. Are you OK? You're not too sad? Not at all! It may sound funny, but I'm much better off. And you? How are things with St?phanie? Well... I'm... I'm in a deep state of uncertainty. What do you mean? I'll explain the situation, here's a summary: Tonight we are supposed to meet at 8 o'clock, and... And if we both show up, it means we're going to live together. If not, we won't see each other ever again. Ah, I understand. You're afraid she won't come tonight. Well, no. She'll certainly be there since this was all her idea. So what's the problem? I don't know if I'm going to be there. Why? Because I don't feel ready to live with someone. - Do you love her? - Yes. Well if you love her, that should be wonderful to live with her. No. No? No. What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid, but you see, I would like to make the most of my youth. What you're saying sounds awful. What do you want me to say? Well you're going to go meet her tonight. Cl?ment do it. Do it for me. Does someone have a plastic bag? Yes, I think I might have one. People are so, so dirty. Look, I have a lottery ticket, I haven't even looked to see if I won! You wouldn't be hurt to never see her again? Of course I'd be hurt, very much so. So all that just to "make the most of your youth." But what do you expect to get out of your youth? I don't know, but I'd like to have some grand experiences, etc. - And some girls too? - Yes, perhaps. But what are you thinking? Are there better girls than St?phanie? No, well actually, I don't even have enough experience to say. Cl?ment, you need to understand something. What? Basically, all girls are the same. I don't know. Well I know. Every girl is the same. Don't bother thinking there are some girls better than others. Perhaps, but as for me, I wouldn't know. You're saying that because you don't have a lot of experience with women. But me, as a woman, I know it. You can believe me. I can't believe you just like that. Experience isn't just about words. It's a personal thing. This is really sad, I know I'm right, yet I can't do anything to help save your relationship. There's no situation more annoying than this. Don't get so upset about it, still try to enjoy the day. I'll try, but I can't guarantee anything. Would you mind if we took a little break? Not at all! Constance? I have an idea. What do you mean? To avoid your foolish separation. I'd like to suggest an experiment. An experiment? Yes. Me or Libert?, if she's OK with it... would become your experimental girlfriend until... - What time were you supposed to meet? - 8 o'clock OK then, until 7 o'clock. This way, you would get an idea of what there could possibly be with another girl and you would realize that all girls are the same. Are you serious? Very much so! Would that be OK with you? Sure, why not? So you have to do this otherwise it means you don't want to try to save your relationship. Uh... look... this has become a really awkward situation. And do you think it isn't awkward for us? You know I'm saying this because it would hurt me to not even try something. It's exactly as if I found garbage in the forest and just left it there without doing anything. So... Do you want to try the experiment? Um... sure, OK. Who do you want to be your girlfriend? Um, I don't know. There's only two of us. Well, uh... I don't want to offend anyone. We wouldn't be offended, it's just an experiment. Why do I have to choose? Well we could just flip a coin. Do you have a coin? Yes. - What side do you want? - Tails. You're tails, I'll be heads. Go on, toss it. Tails. That's better that you end up together since you don't know each other. - Are we going to see the cave? - Yes. Well actually... I'll just wait here for you. Caves kind of scare me. You know I got lost in a cave when I was young. And I've been traumatized ever since. You know Cl?ment, this actually means something deeper... What? it's too complicated but... - Let's go have a look? - Yes. [To begin with, nothing really happened...] [except that Constance was disappointed with the cave.] [As for me, I was annoyed because...] [I wasn't sure if the experiment started or not.] [So, I just acted as normal.] [As myself.] [I continued to show Marseilles, as if all were as normal.] [And I brought them to the Bay of Monkeys.] So that's the Bay of Monkeys. Why is it named like that? Because, well, I think... If you look carefully In the shapes of the rocks you can see monkey heads. I don't see anything. Oh yes, I see one over there. Where? There. [Here too, nothing happened.] Oh yes. [So, very casually, I took them to the "Madrague de Montredon" (a street)] Don't look over there, it's not as pretty. Look over there. Do I look like an American tourist? Are you OK? Sure, why? Don't be so shy, if you want the experiment to work properly. Look! I won ~$30 in the lottery. Great! Ah I completely forgot, I have a camera in my bag. Let me have it. Get beside each other, I'm going to take a picture of you. Don't bother. Of course, this is part of the experiment. Act natural. Libert?, get beside Cl?ment. Cl?ment, put your arm around her. I'm going to do it, OK? Great! Wait I'm going to take another one. Libert?, kiss Cl?ment. Great! [Then, we all went to Libert?'s place.] - People can walk on that bridge? - Yes. - You're not drinking anything? - No, I'm not thirsty. You're not thirsty from earlier? [Generally, I'm pretty good at easing awkward situations.] I have a joke. What is it? It's a bit vulgar though. - I like them once in a while. - Go on, tell us. In fact, it's not a joke, it's a riddle. What is the difference between a nice girl, a very nice girl, and a very, very nice girl? No. A nice girl will give you blow job. A very nice girl will give you a blow job and swallow. And a very, very nice girl will give you a blow job, swallow and leave. It's vulgar though, isn't it? - Yes, but it's funny. - Yes, but it's a good laugh. Anyone up for a nap? - I'm taking off my shoes. - OK. - My feet are a bit dirty. - Mine too. - Would it bother you if I put on a t-shirt? - No, not at all. This room doesn't appear to be a young girl's room. You're right, I don't live here. But, this isn't your place? Yes, it is, but I don't live here for most of the year. Where do you live? I'm studying at Berkeley. Where is Berkeley? It's in California. - You speak English then? - Yes. - Are you tired? - Not really. - Everything OK? - Yes. - And you? - Yes. - Would you like a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. Well actually, I'll have one. I don't want to encourage you to smoke! No, no, I used to smoke, then I quit. Thank you. Wait... In fact, my body doesn't handle it too well. Here, I'll take it. Do you have an ashtray? - You can take the vase on the dresser. - The vase? Sorry, but time's up. The experiment is over, Cl?ment. - What time is it? - 7:02 P.M. So? Uh... so, what? The conclusion of the experiment is? Did Libert? play her role well? Yes, yes, yes. You could at least thank her! Of course... Thank you. So what did you learn from this? Listen, it's difficult to express myself at this point? Are you going to meet with her? Um, I don't know. How can you not know Cl?ment? You have to know now! Don't tell us we did all this for nothing! Oh no, no, you didn't do it for nothing. We'll be so disappointed if you don't go. - Isn't that right, Libert?? - Yes. Visualize her for two seconds Cl?ment, two seconds! What would she feel like if you didn't go? Can you imagine the poor girl? Yes, yes, I can imagine. And you, can you imagine yourself never seeing her again? - Perhaps we'll see each other again in Marseilles? - Yes, perhaps. - If you want my telephone number, ask Constance, she has it. - OK. I think I have yours. - It's 04.91.08.34.20 right? - Yes, that's it. You're leaving on vacation? Yes, I'm leaving tomorrow for two weeks. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Capri. - Do you know it? - No. Hey, you haven't left yet?! It's 7:30 P.M. Cl?ment, hurry up! I'll at least say goodbye to you. Goodbye. Go on! [One hour later...] [I had a message from St?phanie on my mobile phone.] [She said...] [Cl?ment...] [I thought about it] [you're too complicated for me] [our relationship isn't natural] [I'd prefer if we didn't look for each other anymore.] [Goodbye.] Damn! [I played a lot of tennis during my vacation in Marseilles.] [I jogged to improve my respiratory capacity.] [But it's very tiring.] [I took advantage of the beach.] [I don't know why I didn't like it before.] How nice! [I swam a lot.] [That helped my back out a lot.] [I don't know if I said it, but I have scoliosis.] [I partook in simple pleasures] [For example, I ate a lot of ice cream] [especially chocolate ice cream.] [Here I'm not eating chocolate ice cream] [but usually I ate chocolate ice cream.] [And since sometimes I'd happen to pass by Libert?'s place,] [I'd try to ring her doorbell.] [I knew she was on vacation] [but I couldn't remember how long she would be gone.] [And she could perhaps have returned earlier?] [You never know!] [I didn't see a lot of people during this time.] [But solitude is good every once in a while.] [It gives one time to think.] [I often walked past the same guy] [the one that St?phanie told me about.] [Each time he had a different woman in his arms.] - Good evening. - Good evening. [Just by passing each other regularly, we recognized each other] [and we'd greet each other, for no particular reason.] [Then] [one day] [by chance] - Ah hello. - Hello. I was just leaving. - We could at least greet each other. - Yes. I just randomly happened to be passing by - I figured perhaps you'd returned from your vacation. - Yes. Is everything ok? Did you get back home ok? Sure. But it's too bad, since Constance came back with us last night and she left this morning. No worries, I'll uh... call her... So you got a bit of a tan where you were? I don't know, I shouldn't have since I put on sunscreen every day. Well if you have a little time, I would love to hear about your trip I'd love to ask you some questions Are you free for a drink right now? Now? No, I can't I... Someone's waiting for me. How about tomorrow? I'm busy tomorrow too. - All day? - Yes, all day. The day after tomorrow? Actually, this weekend I'll be at my grandparent's house. Oh? So how about Monday? - Monday? - Yes. Actually I can't because I'm going to Biarritz for two weeks. And after Biarritz? After Biarritz, I'll be heading straight to Berkeley. Ah OK. - So I can get your address from Constance? - Yes. I have my car here, would you like me to drop you off anywhere? No, it's OK, I'm heading right over there. Thanks though. - OK goodbye then. - Goodbye. - Have a nice day. - Thanks. Is everything OK? Yes. [Often, I'd also take naps at my father's house.] [His employers were on vacation, so he had more time for himself.] [We would discuss things] [Well, especially he, would discuss things.] Sorry to say but, I can hear you while you're napping. What do you mean? Well I don't spy on you, and don't think negatively of me for this, but You're right next to me, so it's difficult to not hear you. And so? And so I hear you in your sleep And you speak in a muffled voice And what do I say? Libert?... Libert?. You say it several times. Really? So I figured that it might be related to the fact that you are no longer with St?phanie. Oh come on Dad, please! No, no, no. I don't want... just because I divorced your mother, I don't want you to think that living as a couple means a lack of liberty (or freedom). Dad, please don't worry about me. No, no, I'm afraid that just because of me you're afraid of women You know... One woman is not synonymous with a lack of freedom. Dad, I promise you, you're completely mistaken. No, no, I don't want you to take me as an example I feel that with regard to these things, I could only be a negative influence. You know, my love life is not successful, but... If this could reassure you, you should know that my father... had a way with women that was very different from mine. How so? Very different, in fact he never had a divorce. What do you mean by "different"? Different. He was... um... how should I put this... a sort of seducer. - A seducer? - Yes, yes. [Incredible! My father who is very discreet,] [For the first time in my life started talking to me about women] [and his father who he saw as a seducer.] [I was somewhat embarrassed, but the worst was about come...] In seduction... One has to be seduced in order to seduce. It's true, it's obvious. Next, the person who you want to seduce... you have to push her towards confiding in you. There were verses like this... You have to push her towards confiding in you to gain her trust. and then, you must get her to speak but speak about herself, definitely not about you. Uh... a woman... She won't get tired of talking about herself And in this way, her heart can relax. Now after all that, there's a danger... It's that you become... The nice confidant, the nice companion... My father used to say: Nice confidant, never a lover. You can't be too nice, or too soft - Why not? - You have to surprise her. My father told me that one day... he undressed at a party just to surprise a woman. In the end, he was uncompromising. You've got to work it out for yourself somehow to take her hand. There, you'll feel right away if everything is flowing. The hand... always the hand. [Wow! Tonight he was alone.] - Good evening. - Good evening. Would you by chance have a light, please? Uh yes. Wait... Sorry Thank you, good evening. - Excuse me... - Yes? Would you have a cigarette? I don't have any more. Of course. Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Is that you Cl?ment? - Yes it's me. It's not too early. Excuse me? I can't stand the new one, have you seen him? No. You haven't see his shape? Looks like a fig. Really? I'm going to wake her up. Excuse us, but at this time we're usually sleeping. I'm the one who should be excused. No, you were passionate. What are you doing here? Nothing. Well I wanted to say hello. - Really? - Yes. - What are you doing tonight? - I'm sleeping. - Do you have to meet someone? - No, he works at night. Because I wanted to invite you out for a walk. - Really? - Yes. I'll let you decide. Either you come with me for a walk or... or I'll drink this bottle and drive along the cliffs all night. Why are you telling me this? Because if there is an accident, you'll know why. Ah, so this is blackmail then? Yes, absolutely, yes. Well it's disgusting. I agree completely, yes. I'll turn off the headlights, because they will drain the battery. - So? - So, what? What did you do during your vacation? I went to Sanary for two weeks... And... did you swim? A little, yes. Tell me... Why didn't you meet me that night? I'd rather not talk about it. Did you take some time off for vacation or not? Yes, I told you I went to Sanary. Shall we sit down? Sure. So... uh... Have you done any sports recently? Yes, I told you I swam a bit. And... you... you... Did you find any nice areas at Sanary? Yes, very nice. You're a curious girl, aren't you? What do you mean by "curious"? Strange, or just someone interested in things? A bit of both. In any case, it's true that I've been curious about a variety of things. And otherwise, is your mother doing well? What's up with all these questions? Curiosity. Is it bad? No, no. And, so do you have any plans? - Professionally? - Yes. Actually, a girlfriend and I had a great idea, but... What is it? - I can't tell you. - Why not? - So no one will steal it. - It's OK, I won't tell anyone. Promise? You don't trust me? You know how often at night when you're at home for example when you have a party when you run out of cigarettes, you have to go out find an open tobacco vendor, etc. Well, we had the idea of starting a company that would deliver cigarettes to your home. Like how they deliver pizzas. Ah yes, that's a great idea! And how is your job situation? Your idea will do well, you know? Maybe, I still would have to study the markets, investments, etc. So you're thinking of getting into business? Yes, I don't want to be selling sandwiches all my life, that's for sure! So you're going to become a business woman... Can you imagine yourself with franchises all over France? I'd love that, but... They say you shouldn't sell something you don't yet have. Yes, that's true. I think you'd make a good business woman. I think you have what it takes. Like what? You're lively, dynamic, entrepreneurial. Is that all you see in me? No, no, I know you're also a very sensitive person. Stop. No, seriously! You're nice. Do you think I'm nice? Um... Yes, yes. - Shall we go for a swim? - What?! - We're going for a swim. - No! Yes! Stop you're going to catch a cold. We don't have our bathing suits or towels. Come on! I don't want to freeze in that water, stop! My hands are frozen! Feel them. They're cold aren't they? [Well, the story ends here.] [It's not that it won't be continued] [But I don't know what happens next.] [My father still hasn't cut off my funds.] [But I think it will be soon, I can feel it.] Subtitles by silvercloud@KG
