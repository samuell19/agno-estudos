>> YA! >> I HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UP. THIS COULD DAMAGE ME VERY BADLY IF IT'S NOT HANDLED CAREFULLY. >> YOU SEEM, GOVERNOR, RATHER IGNORANT OF THE FUNDAMENTALS THAT PROMPT WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO DO. WE HAVE MONEY. MUCH MONEY. WE WISH TO HAVE MORE. MUCH MORE, IN FACT. THE PEOPLE WITH MONEY PROPOSE TO DRIVE OUT THE PEASANTS. >> WELL, WE DON'T CALL 'EM THAT HERE. >> YOU DON'T, BUT I DO. >> ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS A LITTLE DISCRETION. >> I DON'T RECALL WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR APPEALING TO THE COURTS WHEN HE CAME OVER AND TOOK OUR SCEPTER'D ISLE. RAN RATHER ROUGHSHOD OVER THE LEGALITIES, I FEAR. >> BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, AND THIS IS AMERICA. >> HELLO, MARSHAL. BOY, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU. I THOUGHT YOU AND YOUR MEN WERE A BUNCH OF BUSHWHACKERS. HELL, YOU'RE HUNT LAWTON. >> THAT'S RIGHT, AND THIS IS YOUR UNLUCKY DAY. >> HELL, THAT'S JIMMY ALBERT. >> WHY'D YOU KILL HIM, HUNT? HE AIN'T NO RUSTLER. >> HE IS NOW. PUT HIM ON A HORSE. > YIP. COME ON. >> YA! >> HELLO, JESSE. MITCH. WHERE'S THE WAR? >> NO WAR, HAMMETT. JUST LOOKIN' OUT FOR LORD PETER'S INTERESTS. SEEN ANY OF HIS CATTLE ON THE HIGH MEADOWS? >> NOT ON THE HIGH MEADOWS, SAW SOME WEST OF HERE A LITTLE. >> HOW MANY? >> I DON'T KNOW. ABOUT A HUNDRED. THEY AIN'T MINE, SO I DIDN'T COUNT 'EM. >> GOT A PROPOSITION FOR YOU, HAMMETT. >> OH? >> HOW'D YOU LIKE TO COME AND WORK FOR THE DERBY OUTFIT? >> YOU MEAN WORK FOR YOU AND THAT FANCY MAN, LORD PETER? >> I'LL MAKE YOU A DAMN GOOD OFFER. >> I DON'T DOUBT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW ME, I'M INDEPENDENT. I FIGURE I'M BETTER OFF RANCHING FOR MYSELF. >> YOU MIGHT BE. IF YOU LIVE. >> BACK OFF, MITCH. THIS IS JUST A PARLEY. WELL, JUST REMEMBER, HAMMETT, IF YOU WANT A JOB WITH THE DERBY OUTFIT, YOU GOT IT. >> ALL RIGHT. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ALL ABOUT? YOU DIDN'T ROUND UP THAT WHOLE POSSE BEHIND YOU JUST TO GIVE ME A JOB OFFER, NOW DID YOU? >> A GANG OF RUSTLERS HAS BEEN STEALING CATTLE ALL OVER JOHNSON COUNTY. AND THAT INCLUDES YOUR BROTHER, THE LEADER. >> OH, YOU LOOKIN' FOR MY BROTHER HARRY? OH, I GUESS THE JOB OFFER WAS JUST FROSTIN', HUH? >> YOU KNOW DAMN WELL HE'S A RUSTLER. NOW WHERE IS HE? >> I DON'T KNOW. HE'S A GROWN MAN, MITCH. HELL, NOBODY CAN KEEP UP WITH HIM. I NEVER BEEN ABLE TO. >> YOU MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT MY OFFER, HAMMETT. IT COULD BE YOUR ONLY CHANCE. >> IT'S PUBLIC LAND, JESSE. EXCUSE ME. COME ON, DOG. >> IT'S HIM, ALL RIGHT. HARRY HAMMETT. >> HE'S GOT ABOUT 30 HEAD OF CATTLE PENNED UP. BRANDIN' CALVES AS FAST AS HE CAN THROW 'EM DOWN. >> HE HAS A PARTNER. WHAT ABOUT TIMBERLINE? >> I DIDN'T SEE HIM. >> PROBABLY OUT STEALING MORE STOCK. SO LET'S GO. AIN'T YOU COMIN'? >> THERE'S EIGHT OF YOU, PLUS HUNT. THAT OUGHT TO BE ENOUGH. >> YOU'RE SO RICH NOW, THANKS TO LORD PETER, YOU JUST DON'T LIKE TO DIRTY YOUR HANDS NO MORE. >> ALL RIGHT, LITTLE ONE. HOLD ON. >> YEAH, BOYS, COME ON. OH, DAMN IT. >> COME ON. >> HOLD UP, FELLAS. >> AW, SHOOT. COME, COME ON, COME ON. >> MOVE! >> COME, GET TIMBERLINE. COME ON. COME ON, GO! >> LET'S MOVE IT! >> YA!

I JUST PASSED ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN THAT WERE FRESH BRANDED. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WAS A BRAND INSPECTOR, MR. LAWTON. >> BETTER GET OFF THAT BLANKET, SON. YOU'RE ABOUT TO BURN YOUR BRITCHES ON THAT BRANDING IRON. >> TIE HIS HANDS. >> AND GET HIS GUNS, TOO. >> YES, SIR. >> PUT HIM ON HIS HORSE. >> COME ON. LET'S GO. COME ON. >> YA! >> YOU KNOW, HARRY, I ALWAYS LIKED YOU, THE BEST OF ANY OF THE BROTHERS. YOU WERE THE DUMBEST, BUT YOU HAD SOME SAND. >> HA! >> YA! >> WHERE'D HE GO? >> HE DISAPPEARED. >> HYA! YA! >> GOD. HARRY? DUMB BASTARD. WHAT HAVE YOU GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO NOW? COME ON, LITTLE BROTHER, IT AIN'T YOUR TIME YET. COME ON. DON'T YOU GO ON ME. MUST BE THAT THICK HAMMETT NECK THAT SAVED YOU. >> DON'T YOU GOT ANY WHISKEY? >> NO. I'M DRY. >> HOW ABOUT SOME VINEGAR, THEN? AT LEAST IT GOT SOME TASTE. >> AH, YOU LOLLYGAGGIN' WASTREL. NEARLY HALF-DEAD, AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS LIQUOR. HARRY! >> WELL, THAT, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M LUCKY, I KNOW. MITCH SLAUGHTER DON'T KNOW HOW TO TIE A PROPER HANGMAN'S KNOT. >> MITCH AND JESSE. >> NOT JESSE. JUST MITCH. AND, UH, HE HAD HUNT LAWTON WITH HIM. >> HUNT LAWTON? >> YEAH. >> WELL, IF LORD PETER IS HIRING KILLERS OF HIS ILK, FOLKS UP AND DOWN THIS VALLEY GOT SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE AHEAD. AND YOU, LITTLE BROTHER, YOU BETTER BE MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR ROPE AND BRANDING IRON. >> OH. >> NEXT TIME YOU GET HUNG, I MIGHT NOT BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. >> OH, HELL, CAIN. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH ME. I JUST CAN'T HARDLY STAND TO SEE A LITTLE ORPHAN CALF RUNNING AROUND OUT THERE. I GOTTA GET IN AND PUT MY BRAND ON IT. >> HMM. AND THAT'LL BE YOUR DEMISE. >> YEAH, IF YOUR BAD COFFEE DON'T GET ME FIRST. >> OR WHISKEY. >> I ALWAYS THOUGHT I'D PREFER LOOSE WOMEN. >> OR THAT, TOO. >> OW. >> HOW YOU DOING, DALE? >> GOOD. >> HOW'S THE MISSUS? >> PREGNANT. >> WHAT YOU DOING WITH THAT WIRE, HAMMETT? DON'T YOU KNOW THIS IS OPEN RANGE? >> JUST FENCING IN MY GARDEN, JESSE. >> YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT MOVING ON, HAMMETT. PUTTING IN GARDENS WOULD JUST BE WASTED WORK. >> WHY DON'T YOU MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS, JESSE? >> WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK WHEN SPOKEN TO, JAGER? >> HE'S RIGHT, MR. JACKLIN. YOU CAN'T TELL THESE MEN WHAT TO DO. >> YOU AIN'T SHERIFF FOR LIFE, NED. I'M JUST GIVING THESE MEN FAIR ADVICE, THAT'S ALL. IF THEY WEREN'T SO DAMN HARDHEADED, THEY'D THANK ME FOR IT. >> WELL, IF I WANTED ADVICE, JESSE, YOU'D BE THE LAST MAN I'D THINK OF TO ASK. >> AMEN TO THAT. >> FORWARNED IS FOREARMED. >> NICE SEEIN' YOU, JESSE. >> RICH SON-OF-A-BITCH. I'VE HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF HIM. >> YOU SEEN BROTHER DALE LATELY? >> NO, BUT I WAS JUST ON MY WAY THERE. >> AH, SO THAT'S WHO THAT TROPHY'S FOR. ANYWAY, WHEN YOU FIGURE ON BEING BACK? I, UH, GOT A FEW HEAD OF YEARLINGS. I FIGURE I'LL HAVE YOU SELL 'EM FOR ME. >> NOPE. >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOPE? >> THERE'S SOME THINGS I'LL DO FOR A BROTHER, AND SOME THINGS I WON'T. >> WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT. I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL, BROTHER. I GOT ABOUT, OH, 125 HEAD OR SO, AND THEY'RE ALL READY TO SELL. YOU HANDLE THAT FOR ME, I'LL LEAVE, NEVER BOTHER YOU AGAIN. >> LEAVE? WHERE WOULD YOU GO? >> CALIFORNIA. YES, SIR. I AM DAMN TIRED OF THESE CHILL WINTERS. I'M GONNA GO DOWN THERE AND GET MYSELF A SENORITA. OF COURSE, I GOTTA TELL YOU, LONESOME DAYS LIKE THIS, DAYS I ALMOST BEEN KILLED, I KINDA ENVY DALE. HE'S GOT GOOD WIFE, NICE BOY. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I EXPECT I AIN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT ENVIES HIM. AM I, CAIN? >> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE NEXT TIME THEY HANG YOU, IT JUST MAY TAKE. YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT THAT. >> YOU MISSED YOUR CALLING, BROTHER! YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PREACHER MAN! PREACHER CAIN. >> WHAT ARE WE DOIN', JESSE? THESE CATTLE WERE GRAZING FINE WHERE THEY WERE. THEY WERE ON THE BEST GRASS IN JOHNSON COUNTY. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT 'EM ALL SPREAD OUT FOR? >> WHY YOU GOT 'EM ALL SPREAD OUT? >> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MITCH. JUST MAKE SURE YOU FILL IN MORE OF THAT AREA RIGHT OVER THERE. >> IT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE YOU WANT LORD PETER TO THINK HE'S UP TO HIS ASS IN CATTLE? >> HUNT, WHENEVER LORD PETER LOOKS OUT HIS WINDOW, HE LIKES TO SEE CATTLE, LOTS OF CATTLE. >> BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE THE REASON, WOULD IT? >> YOUR JOB IS TO HANG RUSTLERS, HUNT, NOT MANAGE THE COWHERD. >> YEAH. ONE THING I'VE NOTICED ABOUT LORD PETER, HE AIN'T HALF AS DUMB AS HE LOOKS. >> WELL, THEN NEITHER AM I. >> THAT'S DEBATABLE. >> HEY. >> HEY, UNCLE CAIN. >> THOSE CHICKENS ARE CRAZY. YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL. >> MA SAID YOU'D BE COMIN'. >> SURE ENOUGH I DID. WOULD YOU LOOK AT YOU? YOU'RE GETTING SKINNIER BY THE HOUR. DON'T THEY FEED YOU? >> MA SAYS I MUST HAVE A TAPEWORM. >> YEAH, THAT MUST BE IT. WHERE'S YOUR PA? >> HE'S UP AT THE SHEEP. THERE'S AN OLD WOLF SKULKING AROUND. PA'S HOPING TO GET A SHOT AT HIM. >> UH-HUH. WELL, YOU MIGHT WANNA TELL YOUR MA THAT OLD UNCLE CAIN HAS ROLLED IN WITH THE TUMBLEWEEDS. >> YOU BETTER TELL HER YOURSELF. >> HOWDY. I BAGGED THAT BIGHORN THAT I PROMISED. MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? >> I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TO EXPLAIN. >> YOU GET KICKED BY A COW? >> NOTHING KICKED ME. THIS HORSE OF YOURS STILL LIKES MY SMELL. >> WELL, HERE'S YOUR SUPPER. >> OH, THANKS, CAIN. >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. >> AND YOU. AH, JOEY? WHY DON'T YOU TAKE LONESOME AND I'LL TAKE YOUR PA'S MULE, AND WE'LL GET 'EM A NICE, LONG, COLD DRINK OF WATER, OKAY? >> OKAY. >> YOU EVER HEARD OF A KANGAROO? >> NO. >> WELL, THEY'RE THESE BIG-- I DON'T KNOW-- LIKE GIANT RABBITS IN THIS FAR OFF COUNTRY CALLED AUSTRALIA. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THE BABIES? >> NO. >> JOEYS. THAT'S RIGHT. I READ THAT IN A BOOK. >> HARRY! HELL, I THOUGHT YOU WAS DEAD! >> YEAH, I BET YOU DID, YOU CHEATIN' SON OF A BITCH, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU LET THEM HANG ME! >> NO, NO, NO, YOU GOT IT WRONG, HARRY. WHY WOULD I WANT YOU HUNG WHEN YOU OWE ME MONEY? I NEVER DREAMED YOU'D BE FOOL ENOUGH TO LET 'EM RIDE UP ON YOU WITH A BRANDIN' IRON IN YOUR HAND. I THOUGHT YOU WAS IN IDAHO WITH OUR CATTLE. >> I WAS, AND, YOU KNOW, IT WORKED THIS TIME. BUT IT MIGHT NOT THE NEXT. MY BUYER'S ASKIN' ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS. I RECKON HE DON'T WANNA GET ON THE WRONG SIDE OF LORD PETER NEITHER. >> DON'T. >> WHAT? >> SOMEONE MIGHT SEE YOU. WE AGREED YOU WOULDN'T COME HERE IN DAYLIGHT. THIS IDAHO BUSINESS IS SERIOUS. WHAT ABOUT CAIN? >> CAIN TURNED ME DOWN, RIGHT AFTER HE CUT ME DOWN. >> THIS IS TOO GOOD A THING TO LET GO OF, HARRY. I MEAN, IF IDAHO'S OUT, WHAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA? THERE'S BOUND TO BE A MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. >> OH, YEAH. THERE'S A MARKET. IT'S JUST REAL FAR AWAY. IDAHO'S A LOT CLOSER. BESIDES, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME LORD PETER AIN'T FIGURED OUT YOU STEALING HIS COWS YET? >> HE MAY HAVE AN INKLING, BUT, HELL, THE DERBY RANCH COVERS MORE THAN 200 SECTIONS, ROOM FOR MORE COW THAN WE'RE TAKIN' JUST TO GET LOST. ARE YOU SURE ABOUT IDAHO? CAN'T WE TRY IT ONE MORE TIME? >> MAYBE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. DON'T WANNA PUSH MY BUYER NONE. >> HARRY, BY THE WAY, YOU GOT MY SHARE OF THE MONEY? >> OH, YEAH. BUT I AIN'T GOT IT ON ME. I'VE ALWAYS PAID YOU, JESSE, AND I WILL, IN MY OWN GOOD TIME. >> PULL THE HAMMER ALL THE WAY BACK. AIM SLIGHTLY BELOW THE TARGET. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. LET IT OUT. SQUEEZE. DID YOU BLINK? YOU BLINKED, DIDN'T YOU? >> HEY. JOEY, DON'T YOU GOT SOME CHORES TO BE DOING? >> YES, SIR. >> COME HERE. TAKE THE HORSE IN THE BARN NOW, WILL YOU? GO AHEAD NOW. >> WE'LL WORK ON THIS AGAIN, JOEY. >> COME ON, BOY. >> WHAT? >> WHAT BUSINESS YOU GOT TEACHING MY SON HOW TO SHOOT A PISTOL? >> WELL, HE'S GOT TO LEARN SOONER OR LATER. WE DID WHEN WE WERE HIS AGE. >> THAT MAY BE TRUE, CAIN. BUT TEACHING HIM NOW TO HANDLE A RIFLE SO HE CAN HUNT GAME, THAT'S ONE THING. THE ONLY KIND OF GAME A MAN HUNTS WITH A PISTOL IS THE TWO-LEGGED KIND. >> ALL RIGHT, FAIR ENOUGH. AIN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT RORY WAS SPORTING A PRETTY FAIR SHINER. I THINK OF YOU AS MILD, DALE, THE GOOD HAMMETT. NOT ONE TO HIT A WOMAN. >> SHE CALLED ME A COWARD. NOW, IF SHE CALLED ME LAZY, WHICH SHE HAS MANY A TIME, I LET IT PASS. BUT SHE CALLED ME A COWARD. >> WHY? THE HAMMETTS AIN'T BRED NO COWARDS. >> BECAUSE OF THAT DAMN HUNT LAWTON. WHEN I TOLD RORY I'D SEEN HUNT, SHE JUST FLARED UP, TOLD ME I SHOULD HAVE SHOT HIM ON THE SPOT. NOW, IF HE'D HAVE PROVOKED ME, I WOULD HAVE DRAWN ON HIM. BUT HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD. JUST LEFT. SUPPOSE I'M NOT A COLD KILLER. >> WELL, HEY, THAT DON'T MAKE YOU A COWARD NOW. >> IN MY WIFE'S EYES, I AM. THAT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO LIVE WITH. >> WELL, I GUESS I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. >> DALE, YOUR BROTHER CAIN HERE HAS BROUGHT US A NICE PIECE OF MOUNTAIN MUTTON. YOU GONNA STAY OUT HERE ALL NIGHT? COME INSIDE AND GET READY FOR SUPPER. WELL? >> UM... >> I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE HAMMETTS ONLY PRODUCED ONE CHARMER, AND THAT'D BE HARRY. >> WELL, NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. HE WASN'T SO CHARMING THIS MORNING WHEN I FOUND HIM HANGING FROM THE END OF A ROPE. THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED HIM WAS THAT THICK HAMMETT NECK AND THE FACT THAT I JUST HAPPENED TO COME ALONG WHEN I DID. >> GOOD LORD, THAT'S A MIRACLE. >> ANOTHER 10 MINUTES, HE'D BE A GONER FOR SURE. >> WELL, I DARE SAY, HE GOES A LITTLE TOO FAR SOMETIMES, BUT AT LEAST HE'S GOT SOME SPUNK. >> WELL, WE ALL GOT SPUNK, RORY. DALE'S GOT SPUNK, FOR GOD'S SAKES. >> SPUNK DON'T MEAN YOU CAN BREAK THE LAW, HONEY. >> RORY, I DON'T LIKE HUNT LAWTON ANY MORE THAN YOU DO. GIVEN THE EXCUSE, I'D GUN HIM DOWN. BUT I JUST CAN'T SHOOT HIM OR ANYBODY ELSE IN COLD BLOOD. >> WELL, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME THEN, 'CAUSE THAT MAN KILLED MY GRANDFATHER, CAIN. AND THERE WON'T BE NO COLD BLOOD ABOUT IT IF I EVER GET A CHANCE AT HIM. YOU KNOW, MY BLOOD BOILS EVERY TIME I THINK OF THAT MAN, AND IT'S BOILING RIGHT NOW, AND PART OF THAT BOIL BELONGS TO YOU AND TO DALE FOR BEING SUCH DAMNED MEALY-MOUTHED FOOLS. YOU'VE GOTTA WAIT FOR A PRETTY REASON TO KILL A MAN LIKE THAT. >> ALL RIGHT. >> I GUESS WE OUGHT NOT TELL HER THAT IT WAS HUNT LAWTON THAT TRIED TO HANG HARRY. >> GOOD GOD, CAIN. WE'LL ALL BE SLEEPIN' IN THE BARN IF SHE FOUND THAT OUT. >> SHHH. >> MM, MM, MM, MM, MM. HONEY, YOU ARE ONE FINE, FINE, FINE COOK. >> DON'T YOU BE SWEET TALKING ME, DALE, ESPECIALLY NOT IN FRONT OF COMPANY. >> GOSH, MA. IT WAS JUST A COMPLIMENT. >> NOBODY ASKED YOU, MISTER. >> GOSH. CAN'T I EVEN TALK? >> I'M AFRAID TO TALK MYSELF. >> SINCE YOUR UNCLE CAIN BROUGHT US SUCH A FINE SHEEP, I DECIDED I'D TRY THIS NEW DESSERT. PASS IT DOWN TO YOUR DADDY. DALE. >> WHAT IS IT? >> WELL, IT'S CALLED GELATIN. >> I CAN'T SEEM TO CATCH IT. >> IT'S, UH, IT'S KINDA WIGGLY. >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WIGGLY FOOD. >> IT'S, UH, WELL, IT'S GOOD. >> YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHEW IT. >> NO. YOU JUST SWALLOW IT. >> MM. IT'S GOOD. >> IT'S GOOD. >> MM-HMM. >> SPADE, HONEY, YOU JUST MADE MY DAY. >> MAN, THAT RINGBONE SURE CAN SNORE, CAN HE? >> OH, DAMMIT! IT'S MR. SLAUGHTER. >> YOU BOYS BETTER GET YOUR PANTS ON. >> SORRY, MISS QUEENIE. RINGBONE, WAKE UP, WAKE UP! >> EVENING, MISS QUEENIE. >> LET'S GO. >> EVENING, BOYS. >> AVERY. >> I THOUGHT YOU BOYS WERE RIDING LINE. >> OH, YEAH, WE WERE, MITCH. WE JUST STOPPED OFF FOR-- >> GIT. >> NOW, DON'T GO JUMPIN' ON THESE BOYS, MITCH. THEY JUST STOPPED BY TO HELP ME WIND A CLOCK. >> STOPPED BY TO WHORE, YOU MEAN. >> AND THERE IS THE PAY, ONE OF LORD PETER'S CALVES. >> HE JUST STROLLED ON UP. LOST HIS MA, I GUESS. >> HA. YOU BOYS GET GONE AND DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU AROUND HERE DURING WORK HOURS AGAIN. >> YES, SIR. >> RIGHT. >> AS FOR YOU, IF YOU DON'T QUIT TAKING STOLEN LIVESTOCK FOR POKES, AND IF THAT DAMN HUSBAND OF YOURS DON'T QUIT WRITING LIES TO THE NEWSPAPERS, YOU COULD FIND YOURSELVES IN A PACK OF TROUBLE. >> DON'T THREATEN ME, MITCH SLAUGHTER. I GOT AS MUCH RIGHT TO BE HERE AS YOU DO. AND WHAT AVERY WRITES AIN'T LIES. >> YOU BETTER HEED ME, QUEENIE. NEXT TIME, I WON'T BE SO GENTLE. >> YA! YA! >> BYE, BOYS. >> DALE? DALE, ARE YOU AWAKE? >> WHAT? >> YOU AWAKE? >> I AM NOW. >> HONEY, THIS LITTLE ONE I'M CARRYING, IT'S ALL ELBOWS AND KNEES. WOULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A BACK RUB? >> MAYBE. LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES. >> ALL RIGHT. THEY'RE BYGONES. OH, THAT FEELS SO GOOD. >> THAT CUSS STILL KICKIN'? >> I THINK HE'S GONNA START SETTLING DOWN. >> OOH. HE'S JUST LIKE HIS MOMMA. >> OH. OH. OH. OH. OH. OH. OW. OH. OH. >> THERE YOU GO. >> BABY, THAT FEELS SO GOOD. >> MM-HMM. RIGHT THERE. >> DALE, NOW THAT-- >> OH, HE'S GONNA BE A BOY, ALL RIGHT. >> YOU THINK? >> DALE. OH, DALE. OH. >> NINE MONTHS PREGNANT AND HE CAN'T LEAVE HER ALONE. KNOCK HER IN THE HEAD ONE MINUTE, POKE HER THE NEXT. AND ME, GUEST OF THE HOUSE, SLEEPING RIGHT NEXT TO 'EM, I COULD HEAR EVERYTHING. AH, IT'S SNOWIN' AGAIN. >> SAM, OLD DOG COULD SMELL YOU A MILE AWAY. >> GOT ANY SUPPER LEFT? >> OH, SOME SHEEP JERKY. HAVE AT IT. >> I WAS THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF BIGHORN. >> OH, NO. SORRY. THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN FOR ALREADY. >> GUESS I'LL JUST SETTLE FOR A JERKY THEN. >> UH-HUH. SO HOW'S THE WOLFIN' BUSINESS? >> LORD PETER'S HIRED GUNS ARE SHOOTIN' MY WOLVES BEFORE I CAN TRAP THEM. PERFORATED PELTS AIN'T WORTH SQUAT. >> WELL, I GUESS THE BIG BOYS ARE CAUSING TROUBLE FOR ALL OF US, HUH? >> WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. >> AW, YOU KNOW ABOUT EVERYTHING, SAM. >> MAYBE, MAYBE NOT. >> YOU SEEN HARRY AROUND? >> HARRY? MOST YOUNG'UNS ARE RESTLESS. YOU WERE. >> YEAH, I WAS. WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME TO CAMP HERE TONIGHT IF YOU WISH. >> I GOT TRAPS TO SET. BESIDES, A MAN COULD GET SOFT SLEEPING BY FIRE. >> OH. >> OH, I'D SAY, ARTHUR, JUST MAKE HIM LIFT HIS HEAD. >> IT'S NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS LIKE, MY LORD. >> OH, GOOD LORD, MAN, JUST TRY. >> I'M TRYING, SIR. >> MR. JACKLIN, MR. SLAUGHTER, I WANT A WORD WITH YOU. >> AFTERNOON, SIR. >> GOOD AFTERNOON, MEN. I WANT YOUR OPINION ABOUT SOMETHING. I MUST HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN WITH MY BULL, BUT I'M NOT SURE THIS HAT DOES ME JUSTICE. >> WELL, IT LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT TO ME, SIR. >> AND HOW GOES OUR LITTLE STRUGGLE WITH THE PEASANTRY? >> PRETTY WELL, SIR. PRETTY WELL. >> HOW MANY CATTLE DID YOU SAY I HAVE, MR. JACKLIN? >> ABOUT 5,000, SIR. >> THAT'S ODD. WHENEVER I ACTUALLY RIDE AMONG THEM, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE 5,000. >> WELL, THEY'RE HARD TO COUNT, SIR. JESSE'S GOT 'EM SPREAD ALL OVER THE RANGE. >> OH, DASH IT, MAN. LIFT HIS HEAD. WE MUST TAKE THIS PHOTOGRAPH. YOU'RE DISMISSED, GENTLEMEN. >> PERHAPS YOU COULD SHOW ME HOW, MY LORD. >> PLEASE, MY DEAR FELLOW, DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO. >> YES, SIR. >> COME ON, HAMMISH, LIFT YOUR HEAD. THERE WE--COME IN NOW, SIR! COME IN! >> ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. >> IN YOU COME, MY LORD. >> ALL RIGHT. >> IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT. HAMMISH, HAMMISH, HAMMISH. ALL RIGHT, SIR. >> VERY GOOD, ARTHUR. >> IN YOU COME. >> YES, ARTHUR. OKAY. >> ALL RIGHT, SIR. >> GO AWAY, ARTHUR. GET OUT OF THE PICTURE. >> OH, YES. >> PERFECTLY STILL. >> ARTHUR! TAKE CARE OF THE BULL. >> I'VE GOT THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL. WELL DONE, HAMMISH. VERY NICE. >> HOWDY. >> THANKS FOR ALL THE HELP, BROTHER. >> YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, DALE. I CAN'T HARDLY STAND TO BE AROUND THESE DAMN SHEEP, MAKES ME START TO GAG. >> TAKE A DEEP BREATH. >> OH GOD. LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN BIT BY A COYOTE OR SOMETHIN'. >> THINK IT'S THAT OLD YELLOW WOLF AGAIN. I GOT THREE OR FOUR SHOTS OFF AT HIM. JUST CAN'T SEEM TO HIT HIM THOUGH. >> YEAH. >> I TELL YOU WHAT. YOU'D BEST WATCH YOUR BROTHER HARRY. HARRY'S TRICKY AND HE'S JEALOUS OF YOU. >> HARRY JEALOUS? WHY WOULD HE BE JEALOUS OF ME? >> FOR LOTS OF REASONS, CAIN. FOR ONE, FOLKS LOOK UP TO YOU. THEY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. HARRY'D MUCH RATHER IT WAS HIM THEY LOOKED UP TO, AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT HE RIDES WITH THE WILD ONES. YOU KNOW, IF HE CAN'T GET ATTENTION BEING GOOD, HE'S GONNA GET IT BEING BAD. >> NO. HARRY WAS LIKE THAT AS A KID. I JUST DON'T SEE WHY YOU'D THINK HE'D BE JEALOUS. >> HARRY KNOWS I LIKE YOU BEST, CAIN. >> WHAT? >> YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID. AND DON'T YOU PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW. I'VE ALWAYS LIKED YOU BEST. >> WHERE YOU BEEN, HARRY? >> WHAT DO YOU MEAN? >> WE AIN'T SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE. JOEY KEEPS ASKING WHERE HIS UNCLE HARRY IS, AND I DON'T KNOW. >> YOU JUST TELL HIM THAT UNCLE HARRY HAS BEEN A BUSY MAN LATELY. >> WELL NOW, BUSY DOING WHAT? >> LITTLE OF THIS, LITTLE OF THAT. >> A LITTLE RUSTLING HERE AND THERE. >> YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A ONE-TRACK MIND. YOU SOUND JUST LIKE CAIN, YOU BOTH GOT ONE-TRACK MINDS, YOU, HIM AND RORY. >> THAT'S NOT TRUE. RORY'S MIND'S GOT PLENTY OF TRACKS. RIGHT NOW, IT'S ON A HUNT LAWTON TRACK, AND SHE THINKS ONE OF US OUGHT TO BE MAN ENOUGH TO KILL HIM. >> OH, YOU GOT TO HURRY UP, DALE. I'M FIXING TO PUKE NOW. >> DO IT OVER THERE, OKAY? >> YEAH. I'M TURNING HIM LOOSE. >> GO, GO. >> LET HIM GO. NOW I'M GONNA BRING JOEY A BAG OF MARBLES OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW. AND WHEN I DO, YOU TELL RORY NOT TO BE SO DAMN COLD WITH ME. >> I DON'T HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE OVER HER IN THAT REGARD, LITTLE BROTHER. I DON'T THINK SHE TRUST YOU. >> HUH. >> HELL, I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE TRUSTS ME. >> SHE TRUST CAIN, DOESN'T SHE? >> YEAH, SHE TRUSTS CAIN. EVERYBODY TRUSTS CAIN. >> RORY, IF YOU LIKED ME SO MUCH, WHY DID YOU GO AND MARRY MY LITTLE BROTHER? >> WITH YOU, I MIGHT HAVE HAD TO KNUCKLE UNDER. AND WITH DALE, I DON'T. >> YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS HARRY YOU WERE GONNA MARRY. AND OVERNIGHT, YOU JUST RAN OFF WITH DALE. >> WELL, DALE WOULDN'T NOTICE IT WAS RAINING UNLESS HE HALF-DROWNED, BLESS HIS HEART. AND I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I MARRIED HIM, SO I CAN PURSUE MY OWN PURSUITS AND NOT BE QUESTIONED. >> YOU GIVE ME A BUNCH TO THINK ABOUT. >> YOU THINK ALL YOU WANT, CAIN HAMMETT. I DO LIKE YOU BEST. I ALWAYS HAVE. >> RECKON YOU'RE AN ORPHAN NOW, LITTLE FELLER. COME ON. >> YA. GET ON THERE. >> COME ON, LITTLE DOGGIE. COME ON. >> HERE WE GO. THERE, MAYBE QUEENIE CAN NURSE YOU UNTIL SHE FINDS YOU A MAMMA. >> WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING, CAIN HAMMETT? >> OH, HI. WELL, I BROUGHT YOU AN ORPHAN. HIS MA DIDN'T MAKE IT. >> WELL, IF IT'S A REAL ORPHAN. I TOLD YOU PLENTY OF TIMES, WHATEVER YOU WANT, IT'S ON THE HOUSE. IT'S JUST THEM RIFF-RAFFY COWBOYS I CHARGE A YEARLING OR TWO. AND SOME OF 'EM I WOULDN'T TAKE ON FOR 50 YEARLINGS. >> OH, WHO WOULD BE FOOL ENOUGH TO FALL FROM FAVOR WITH YOU, QUEENIE? >> MITCH SLAUGHTER, FOR ONE. HUNT LAWTON FOR ANOTHER. I'LL SLEEP WITH THIEVES, BUT I DRAW THE LINE AT KILLERS. YOU HUNGRY? >> WELL, THIS IS ONE YEARLING THAT WILL NEVER RISE AGAIN. HMM. >> YOU DIDN'T COME ALL THIS WAY JUST FOR A FREE LUNCH, DID YOU? >> WHAT ABOUT AVERY? >> THIS AIN'T YOUR FIRST TIME, EXACTLY. WHY BRING UP AVERY NOW? >> NO. I MEAN, I NEVER FIGURED WHETHER YOU TWO ARE MARRIED OR WHAT? >> LIFE IS PECULIAR, HONEY. EVEN YOU AIN'T MAN ENOUGH TO CHANGE THAT, BUT YOU SURE ARE MAN ENOUGH TO MAKE IT A HELL OF A LOT MORE FUN. >> ALL THE WAY UP. >> RIGHT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TAKE THAT LAND AND JOIN IT. >> THERE YOU ARE, SIR. ENJOY. >> THANKS, JOHN. NICE TO SEE YOU. >> IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT... IT'S A GOOD START. >> LEGISLATION IS GONNA APPROVE IT. COUNCIL MEETING NEXT WEEK... >> WHERE'D YOU GET THAT DAMN VEST, JESSE? MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A CHICAGO PIMP. WOULDN'T LAST A MINUTE IF WE WERE DEHORNING. >> YEAH. WELL, WE'RE NOT DEHORNING, WALLY. WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY VEST? >> I RATHER DEPLORE IT MYSELF, I'M AFRAID. >> WHO GIVES A DAMN WHAT VEST HE'S WEARING? HOW ARE WE DOING IN THE BIGHORN VALLEY? SQUATTERS ON THE RUN YET? >> SOME OF THEM ARE. OTHERS, WE'VE ELIMINATED. >> BY LEGAL MEANS, I HOPE, JESSE. THE LESS OF THIS GETS IN THE PAPERS, THE BETTER. >> WHAT ABOUT THAT MARSHAL I APPOINTED? UH, LAWTON WAS HIS NAME. >> HE DOES WHAT I TELL HIM TO. >> WHAT ABOUT THE HAMMETTS? >> THEY'RE STILL AROUND. THEY'RE STUBBORN. >> CAIN HAMMETTS' NO SQUATTER. HE BOUGHT HIS SPREAD LEGAL. >> NOBODY ASKED YOU, CLAYBORNE. >> WELL, I SAY WE MASSACRE THEM LIKE WE DID THE WOOLIES, AFRICA, YOU KNOW? ANYONE FOR BILLIARDS? >> HE DIDN'T REALLY MEAN THAT, DID HE? >> IT MIGHT COME TO THAT. THIS SQUATTER MOVEMENT HAS TO BE STOPPED. DAMMIT, JACKLIN! CAN'T YOU FORCE THESE LITTLE MEN OUT? >> YES, I CAN, BUT IT'S A BIG VALLEY, AND HUNT LAWTON'S JUST ARRIVED. WE NEED MORE TIME. >> NOT MUCH MORE, I HOPE. >> AVERY. >> HELLO, CAIN. EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE, THE MAIL RIDER'S DUE BY, AND I WANNA GET THIS LETTER OFF TO THE NEWSPAPER SO IT WILL MAKE THIS WEEK'S EDITION. >> OH, YEAH? TRYING TO GET YOURSELF HUNG, ARE YOU? >> NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO LET THE PEOPLE OF THE VALLEY KNOW WHAT LORD PETER AND JESSE JACKLIN ARE UP TO. THEY'VE JUMPED THE ROUNDUP. >> WHAT? THEY CAN'T DO THAT! THAT'S A LEGALLY POSTED ROUNDUP. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE LITTLE STOCKMEN CAN RECOVER THEIR STOCK THAT DRIFTED OFF DURING THE WINTER. MY STOCK INCLUDED, THAT'S FOR SURE. >> AVERY'S RIGHT, CAIN. MITCH SLAUGHTER TOLD US STRAIGHT OUT. >> IF HE INTENDED TO MOVE UP THE DATE UP, WHY WOULD HE TELL AVERY? I MEAN, AVERY, YOU'RE JUST GONNA REPORT IT TO THE PUBLIC IN THE PAPERS. >> I GOT HIM TO ADMIT IT. >> WHEN EXACTLY IS THIS ILLEGAL ROUNDUP SUPPOSED TO START? >> NEXT WEEK. >> DAMN THEM! WELL, IF THAT'S THE GAME THEY'RE PLAYIN', THEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOME UNEXPECTED VISITORS. >> WEATHER OR NO WEATHER, IT WILL BE DONE, MR. JACKLIN. >> SIR, YOU REALIZE BY BUMPING IT THIS FAR AHEAD, WE'RE BOUND TO RILE UP THE HOMESTEADERS. >> PRECISELY. >> YES, SIR. >> HEY, WHO'S THAT, YOUR LORDSHIP? >> THAT, SIR, IS RUSSELL OF THE TIMES. >> THE TIMES? >> THE TIMES OF LONDON. I'M SURE YOU READ HIS ZULU WAR DISPATCHES. HE'S COME HERE TO INTERVIEW ME ABOUT MY CATTLE EMPIRE. YOU ARE DISMISSED, GENTLEMEN. ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE, THEY AREN'T GENTLEMEN. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? HOW WAS YOUR JOURNEY? >> DUSTY. >> YES, WELL, WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM FLEET STREET. >> IS THAT A NEWSPAPER? >> I DON'T KNOW, MITCH. >> LORD PETER, MAY I ASK, WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS AFFAIR CALLED A ROUNDUP? >> PERHAPS ARTHUR WOULDN'T MIND EXPLAINING. >> VERY WELL THEN. ARTHUR? >> WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, THE COUNTRY AROUND HERE IS VERY OPEN. PERFECTLY OPEN, ONE MIGHT ALMOST CLAIM. INDEED, SIR, IT'S ABSOLUTELY OPEN. >> OPEN? OUR READERS DEMAND PRECISION THESE DAYS, YOU KNOW? IMPRECISION IS NOT WELCOMED. >> WELL, YOU SEE, SIR, THERE ARE NO FENCES. NONE AT ALL. NOT A ONE. SO YOU SEE THE THING IS, SIR, THAT DURING THE WINTER THE CATTLE GET VERY MIXED. EVERYONE'S CATTLE, AS IT WERE, SORT OF STRUGGLES ALONG TOGETHER, VERY PROMISCUOUSLY MIXED, IF YOU GET MY MEANING, SIR. >> QUITE. I CAN SEE HOW THERE WOULD BE OPPORTUNITY FOR PROMISCUOUS MIXING.

HE KNOWS I CAME BY THEM HONESTLY. >> LOOK, MAYBE LORD PETER AIN'T AS STUPID AS WE THINK.

JESSE. >> HARRY. >> I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. >> WELL, I WAS DEAD. OF COURSE, THAT WAS JUST ONE OF MY NINE LIVES. I FIGURE I PROBABLY GOT SIX OR SEVEN LEFT. >> WE GOT ALL THE HANDS WE CAN USE. >> WELL, THIS IS A PUBLIC ROUNDUP, AIN'T IT? ANY MAN WHO'S REGISTERED A BRAND IN THE STATE OF WYOMING IS FREE TO COME GET HIS STOCK. >> YEP. THAT'S THE LAW, JESSE. UNLESS YOU MEAN TO UPSURP THE LAW? >> THIS ROUNDUP WASN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TILL NEXT WEEK. >> BUT EVERYBODY IN JOHNSON COUNTY KNOWS NOW, DON'T THEY? >> THAT DAMN AVERY. I TOLD HIM-- >> IT'S AN OPEN ROUNDUP. YOU BOYS CAN STAY. >> WELL, GOSH. THANKS, JESSE. WE'LL BE SURE TO GET A COUNT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. >> GET UP NOW. >> AND I MEAN AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT. >> RIGHT. JUST BUNK DOWN ANYWHERE. >> WE WILL. >> I SMELL SHEEP. NO, IT AIN'T SHEEP I SMELL. IT'S JUST A STINKIN' SHEEPMAN. >> THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FIGHT, CAIN. >> I WAS JUST WONDERIN' WHY THE DERBY CAMP THOUGHT IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRING A LAWMAN TO A CATTLE ROUNDUP. >> IT'S NONE OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS WHY HE'S HERE. YOU BROUGHT A KNOWN CATTLE THIEF TO A ROUNDUP. SUPPOSE WE CAN BRING A MARSHAL IF WE WANT. >> HOLD YOUR TONGUE, MITCH. THE HAMMETTS ARE HERE, AND THEY'RE WELCOME TO STAY. >> LET IT BE, CAIN.

YOU CARVE IT. >> GONNA BE A FINE BREAKFAST, SAM. YOU KNOW, SAM, YOU BETTER HAVE THE TAIL. ALWAYS SAVE THE TAIL FOR THE HUNTER. NOW YOU DID PREFER IT WITH THE HAIR ON, DIDN'T YOU? >> NO OTHER WAY TO EAT THIS FINE CRITTER THAN WITH HAIR AND ALL. >> NEXT. >> EYES WIDE, BOYS. WE GOT VISITORS. OH, IT'S TASCOT AND WALDY. >> I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF JESSE DIDN'T OFFER THEM A GLASS OF LORD PETER'S CHAMPAGNE. >> DON'T THINK SO. JESSE'S NOT THAT BOLD. THEY'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH HAMBONE'S COFFEE, BIG MEN THAT THEY ARE. >> THINK THEY EAT KIDNEYS? >> NAW. SNAILS. WELL, GOOD MORNIN'. >> I ASKED YOU ONCE TO JOIN UP WITH US, CAIN, AND I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN. TOP TERMS. $60 A MONTH, AND YOU CAN RUN A HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE ON YOUR OWN. >> AND I RECKON THE SAME OFFER WOULD APPLY TO MY BROTHERS AND MR. TIMBERLINE HERE? >> NO.

I DON'T SUPPOSE HIS LORDSHIP WOULD RELISH THAT NOW, WOULD HE? >> HOW MANY CATTLE YOU CLAIMIN'? >> I THOUGHT MAYBE 200 HEAD. >> GET THEM AND LEAVE. I OFFERED YOU A JOB ON GOOD TERMS. YOU WERE FOOL ENOUGH TO TURN ME DOWN. YOU CAN ALL BE RUN OUT FOR ALL I CARE. >> I SUPPOSE YOU CATTLE BARONS BEEN PAYIN' THIS SKUNK'S SALARY. >> YOU SHOULD MIND YOUR MANNERS, BOY. I AM THE LAW, APPOINTED BY YOUR OWN GOVERNOR, TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU. ESPECIALLY... THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY. >> WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO ALL THAT BIG TIME WATCHIN' OUT OF ONE EYE NOW, HUH? >> DAMN. THAT WAS PRETTY SMART, FOR A HAMMETT BOY, TO HIT SOMEBODY WHEN THEIR BACK WAS TURNED. >> ALL RIGHT. IF WE'RE DONE CONDUCTING BUSINESS, I'M GONNA CUT MY CATTLE OUT AND GO. >> WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL HIM? YOU LET A MAN STEP UP LIKE THAT AND KNOCK YOU ON YOUR ASS AND YOU DIDN'T SHOOT. >> NO, I DIDN'T. >> THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO CUT THE MAN DOWN. >> I COULD'VE CUT DOWN DALE. BUT THEN CAIN WOULD'VE SHOT ME, OR HARRY. AND YOU EXECUTIVE TYPES WOULDN'T HAVE HELPED A BIT 'CAUSE YOU'D HAVE BEEN JUST STANDIN' THERE WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR PANTS. >> WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE GETTIN' PAID TO TAKE CARE OF THESE FELLAS. >> AND I WILL. I'LL TAKE CARE OF CAIN. IN MY OWN TIME. WHEN THE ODDS ARE RIGHT. >> CAIN HAMMETT'S THE BACKBONE.

THIS LOOKS BAD, VERY, VERY BAD. >> WELL, LIKE I SAID, SIR, IT WAS MOSTLY AN ACCIDENT. >> SMALL CONSOLATION FOR THE WOMAN WHO IS RATHER DEAD. BUT THERE IS A LARGER POINT.

THAT'LL BE IN EVERY DAMN NEWSPAPER IN THE COUNTRY. STIRRING UP SYMPATHY FOR THE HOMESTEADER. SURPRISED LORD PETER DIDN'T SHOOT YOU ON THE SPOT. HELL, I SHOULD HAVE SHOT YOU MYSELF. >> SHE'S JUST AN OLD WHORE, JESSE. FOLKS AIN'T GONNA HAVE MUCH SYMPATHY FOR SOME BOSSY OLD WHORE. >> HYAH! >> DAMN, JESSE. >> SHOWS HOW STUPID YOU REALLY ARE. MEN LIKE WHORES, IN CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED. >> HELP ME CATCH MY HORSE. >> YOU CAN WALK. IT WOULDN'T BREAK MY HEART IF A GRIZZLY GOT YOU. >> JESSE. >> WHOA. >> UM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I, UH, PROBABLY HAVE TO GO, YOU KNOW, AND HELP EVERYONE LOOK FOR DENCIL. >> YOU KNOW, MANY'S A TIME I WISH I NEVER LEFT OHIO. DENCIL'S A GOOD MAN, BUT HE AIN'T REAL STRONG. LAST WINTER, HE WAS SICK HALF THE TIME. >> YEAH, YOU SEE, THAT, THAT THERE'S THE MAIN REASON I AM GOING TO CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW, THEY GOT A WARM WINTER. AND ALL TOLD, THE HAMMETTS NEVER FIGURED ON SETTLING HERE IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY ANYWAY. IT'S JUST WHERE MY GRANDFATHER'S WAGON BROKE DOWN. HE'S TOO LAZY TO FIX IT. BUT THEY, THEY WAS ON THEIR WAY TO OREGON. AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE GRANDMA STARTED HAVING KIDS HERE, THAT WAS THAT. >> DENCIL AND I BEEN HOPING FOR A BIG FAMILY. WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT STARTED. >> HEY, YOU'RE STILL REAL YOUNG. YOU GOT YOUR WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF YOU. YOU'RE REAL YOUNG. YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA GO FIND DENCIL. >> YEAH, ALL RIGHT. GO ON, I'M FINE. >> ALL RIGHT. >> MY GOD. WHY DENCIL? WHY LIKE THIS? >> 'CAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO SCARE US. THEY KNEW WE'D DISCOVER HIM AND FIND HIM LIKE THIS. >> MIGHT AS WELL GET HIM DOWN. >> HOWDY, DALE. >> BUTCHER. >> WHAT CAN I GET YOU? >> WHISKEY. GIVE ME ANOTHER. >> YOU'RE MOVING TOO SLOW, HUNT. >> YOU WANT IT FAST, OR YOU WANT IT LEGAL? >> I WANT IT BOTH. I GOT LORD PETER TO THINK OF. >> LORD PETER IS A POMPOUS ASS. HE'S RAPING THIS COUNTRY. AND WHAT HE LEAVES, HE'S GONNA KEEP FOR HIM AND HIS FRIENDS. THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU. >> I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING. NED SINE WON'T GET MY VOTE NEXT TIME WE ELECT A SHERIFF. >> I LIKE NED. HE'S HONEST. BUT I ADMIT HE MOVES SLOWLY. >> SLOWLY? HE AIN'T EVEN MOVING. NO ONE'S BEEN ARRESTED FOR THE MURDER OF JIMMY ALBERT OR THE HANGING OF QUEENIE AND AVERY OR DENCIL OR ANY OTHER CRIME HERE IN JOHNSON COUNTY. HUNT LAWTON'S THE KILLER AND MITCH SLAUGHTER HIS WILLING SIDEKICK. >> GUILTY EARS HAVE THE BEST HEARING. DALE? DALE, THINK ABOUT IT. >> YOU DON'T SEE IT, DO YOU? YOU'RE A HIRED GUNMEN JUST LIKE THE REST. >> YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF THE HAMMETTS. AND REMEMBER, HUNT, IT'S GOTTA LOOK LEGAL. NO BACKSHOOTING. >> WHY YOU HYPOCRITICAL BASTARD. YOU WANT THE HAMMETTS KILLED, BUT YOU DON'T WANT ANY BLOOD SPLATTERED ALL OVER YOU. ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT, BUT I'LL DO IT MY WAY WHETHER I DROP A SAFE ON THEIR HEADS OR SHOOT THEM THROUGH THE LIPS. DEAD IS DEAD. I'LL KILL THE HAMMETTS. I JUST DON'T PROMISE IT'LL BE NEAT. >> IT'LL BE NEAT, YOU MURDERING SON OF A BITCH. >> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING, HAMMETT? >> STAY PUT. >> GET UP, COME ON. GET UP. COME ON. >> HARRY, COME ON IN. >> WELL, I, UH, I DON'T WANT TO INTRUDE, CLARA. >> NO, NO. I GOT COFFEE ON. >> OH. THIS, IT'S FOR YOU. >> WHAT'S THIS? >> OH, THAT'S JUST A LITTLE MONEY. I OWED IT TO DENCIL FROM A HORSE TRADE WE DONE A WHILE BACK, AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, MIGHT HELP YOU OUT AROUND HERE OR SOMETHING. >> HELP OUT? >> UH-HUH. >> IT'LL SAVE ME. YOU'VE JUST BEEN SO GOOD TO ME, HARRY. >> OH, WELL, I... >> I'M BEHOLDEN TO YOU, HARRY. >> COME ON. YA! HEY, YA! >> SON OF A... YA! >> PA'S COMING. >> JOEY, HONEY, TAKE YOUR LITTLE BROTHER INSIDE. DO IT RIGHT NOW. DO IT QUICK, GO! >> OH GOD! NO! NO, DALE! DALE! NO! NO! NO! LOOK AT YOU! DALE! DALE!
