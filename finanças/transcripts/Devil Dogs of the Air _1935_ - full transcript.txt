Ten-hut! Present arms! Well, Brannigan, glad to see you again. Thank you, sir. I'm glad to see you. Thank you very much. Very nice inspection. Thank you, sir. Dismiss your division! Dismissed! Lieutenant Brannigan. - Telegram for you, sir. - Thank you. Hey, Brooklyn, why don't you pay your tailor? If I do, I'll have to pay everybody off. Don't tell me you've been transferred. I don't know. Let's see what it is. Listen to this. "Thanks to you, I'm on my way to San Diego "to enlist in Marines and train as reserve flier. "Arrived today. Love and kisses. "Thomas Jefferson O'Toole." - What do you gather from that? - He's a Democrat. Not only that, but he was one of the finest little kids that ever put on shoes in Brooklyn. Don't tell me they wear shoes in Brooklyn. Yeah, and on the right foot too. Oh, you're gonna like this kid. He's swell. Well, Bill, any friend of yours is a friend of ours. We're glad to have O'Toole with us. He used to live next door. Used to cut my uncle's lawn. In those days, I was in the ranks and, you know, he used to follow me around hero worship and all.. I'll never forget, one time it was my birth.. - You know birthdays? - Oh, sure. What do you think his mother caught him doing? - Giving you 32 smacks. - No. Oh, stealing two bucks out of his bank so he could take me out and get me a tattoo. Yeah? Say, when did the kid learn how to fly? Oh, when he was about, uh, about 16. He's been nuts on aviation ever since. Hey, look, fellas, we better get our mind on that review. And here's hoping the old man-- Now, now, wait a minute. Now, when the kid gets here, he's gonna rave about me and, you know, and all that sort of thing. Now, do me a favor, will ya? Pipe down and lay off of him. Oh, sure. Thanks, alright. 'Officers, forward...march!' Officers, halt! Sir, the officers and men to be commended are present. Publish the orders. "Headquarters, United States Marine Corps, Washington DC. "From, the major general commandant. "To, the commanding general, Sixth Marine Division "Fleet Marine Force, San Francisco, California. "Subject, Letter Of Commendation. "The major general commandant in accordance "with the recommendation of the commanding general "Fleet Marine Force, takes pleasure in commending you "on the recent inspection of all units under your command. "He's pleased to commend your division "for the excellence of its staff "the high state of its efficiency "discipline and morale.. "...for the splendid appearance of its officers and men "and for the unusually fine condition "of its equipment and materiel. "The commandant desires to convey to you.. Captain.. Find out who that crazy aviator is and if he tries to land on government property get him off immediately. Aye, aye, sir. Battalion, attention! Hey, Mike, look at the sky. He's planning to commit suicide. Take it over to my quarters. Crash, drive me out to where that plane's trying to land. Hop right in, lieutenant, it looks like I gotta be there too to bring something home. Hop in yourself, or there'll be nothing left to bring home. Oh merrily we roll along roll along roll along Come on, Caruso, get it out of second gear. Merrily we roll along, roll along.. Not the voice, the car! Roll along merrily we roll along o'er the deep blue sea Hey, that guy is out of his mind. It won't be long before he's out of the plane. That guy is a cinch to crack up. That won't hurt my feelings. I ain't had a pick-up since the fleet left. Mike, get the stretcher! Roll along.. Oh, look out! Driver, take me out to that plane that's trying to land. Yes, sir. There he goes. He's gotta crack up this time. Alright, the stretcher. - Wait a minute. - Oh. He's gonna make it. How do you like that guy? Perfect three-point landing. Doggonit, you can't depend on anything nowadays. That's what makes life so tedious. Say, what's the matter with you, you gone nuts gunning over a government air-field 'breaking up a review..' Tommy! Kiss my foot, if it isn't Bill Brannigan. How are you, you old piece of horse meat? Oh, now, Nick, Nick, lay off, will you, kid? I'm glad to see you, and I'm not swell headed but don't act like this. I'm here on official business. Now, listen, you just made a clown entrance broke up a review, and the general's sore-- The general's sore? I'm the one that should be sore, why isn't he here to meet me? I came down here to give the marines a blood transfusion. Listen, will you cut it out? You're making a bad impression. You wanted to be a marine? Well, you got a great start. They sent me out here to get you off of government property. Why, you can't do that to me. I came down here because of you. I know that, will you get this chicken coop off the reservation maybe I can square it with the General. What for? He oughta decorate me for giving him a circus. No, I know, Tommy, but you oughta know better than this. It's against regulations to stunt over a government field. You oughta know that. Supposing you'd cracked up over those men. What? Me crack up? Why, I can fly the crates they come in. Yeah. Oh, listen, kid, you're gonna get me in a spot. Now, will you get that boxcart out of here change your clothes, come in the front way before you get yourself in a jam? Now, will you stop acting like the head of a girl's finishing school and behave. - Now, come on. - Brannigan. Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - Carry out orders. Either get this man off the reservation or place him under arrest. Yes, sir. This is a government landing-field. Civilian planes are not allowed to set down here. Get that crate out of here before I place you under arrest. Alright, dearie. But my heart is broken. Oh, uh.. ...what do you say, sweetheart? Would you mind spinning it for me? - Off. - Off. 'Contact.' Contact. If he flew like that in the service he wouldn't last a minute. Who is that crazy aviator? Oh, he's just a wild young kid. He's a pretty good flier though. Are you hurt? Are you alright? You okay? No, no. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be alright. Now, just hold on to your seats. And no souvenir hunting. Got that? No souvenir hunting. - A-are you hurt? - No, no, I'm alright, just.. Is he alright, mother? I've got a twinge in my stomach as though somebody was shooting at me with a Roman candle. Well, sit down quick, I.. You ain't holding your stomach, that's your gallbladder. Oh, here I am feeling as though the whole Russian army walking over me with track shoes and you worry about inches. Betty, get the hot-water bottle. And phone Crash. See if he can get the station ambulance over. Tell her I'll just go for the hot-water bottle. Why make things more difficult. Oh, now, don't you go worryin'. Oh, how can I help it? Because I'm a sentimentalist. Look at this ship. Oh, I know how you feel. But don't you worry. We'll get the station crash-wagon over-- No much use about kidding, mother. - I've made up my mind already. - To what? I'm gonna sell it to you. Cheap. - To me? What? - The ship. Fifty bucks. - The plane? - Yeah. Well, what would I do with it? Mount it out in front for an advertisement. Paint the wings, fix it up, and for $50 you've got a drawing card worth millions. Catch the eye of everybody who passes. That's a good idea. You feel strong enough to walk over to the kitchen while I get the checkbook? Walk over? Come on, let's run. Oh! Betty. Betty. Where's the checkbook with that pen with the ink in it? I don't know, mother. Around some place, I suppose. Come on, you better come over to the bench and lie down. - There. - Oh. 'What's under your tunic?' What do you think, honey, buried treasure? - Are you really hurt? - Well, you know how it is. A fellow recovers very quickly with a beautiful nurse. - 'That'll be enough.' - Ow. I've called the ambulance. I guess you're alright. Well, look, Grace. That's what your mother called you, wasn't it? It's Betty. Now, do you think you can gather enough superhuman strength and go out and meet the station ambulance? Well.. ...I'll try. That leaves a dollar and 62 cents, Betty. 'Do you have to pay for the gas this week?' No, dear, go right ahead. Ah.. ...that's a wonderful mother you have. Well, that cleans out our bank balance. I, uh, don't mean to offend, but would you mind telling me exactly what you sold my mother? A ship. I dropped it right between a tree chicken coop, and a garage. And what do you think she's gonna do with it? You can search me. It's a cinch she won't fly it. You're awfully smart, aren't you? Come on outside, I want to talk to you a second. Only a second? Tightwad. I, I'm sorry if I was rude but honestly, this is terribly important to us. What? Please don't sell mom anything 'cause we're having such a hard time to get along. You know, you're doing things to me, don't you, baby? You're positively disgusting. - Here's your check. - Oh, thanks. Uh, you sure you're feeling better? Oh, this is like giving me new life, mother. Now, look, if you'll, uh, if you just excuse us for few seconds. - I'd like to talk to the nurse. - Of course. Eddie Graham and the image of your father. Betty's father was a marine. Died in the Nicaraguan campaign. - Shot? - No, mumps. - Oh, I see. - He got a medal too. You know, I got it pinned to his picture back home on the piano. For bravery? No, the gave it to him. Oh, I see. Now, uh, now, look. I'm gonna endorse this back to you.. ...and your mother can have the jalopy. Oh, that's really sweet of you, but I'm awfully ashamed for-- No, that's alright. Of course, you, uh, you understand that you've got to sign your name under my endorsement. Will I? Watch how quickly. Yeah. - Well, there you go. - Thank you. - What? - Oh, come on now. You don't have to take the mortgage money to pay that debt. Now, look. Keep your hands off me before I slap you. Merrily we roll along roll along roll along Merrily we roll along o'er the deep blue sea Merrily we roll along o'er the deep blue sea Who's our patient? Me. Get in yourself. - Hi, Betty. - Hello, Bill. What's the matter? You look like you lost your last friend. More trouble. Some fresh kid sold mother a wrecked plane of all things. A fresh kid, huh? And mamma gave him a check for almost all our money. Say, listen did he have pink pants and a sky blue tunic-- Yes. Do you know him? "Know him?" I've known him all my life. I'm responsible for getting him here. But, listen, honey, he's only a kid. Don't pay any attention to him, I'll get the check back for you. Only a kid? He did give the check back, but look. Is that a baby's trick? That's fine. A fast worker, huh? Is he? I was only with him a couple of seconds before he had his arm around me. I won't be with him long, and I'll have my arm around him. Now, quit worrying, will you? It's a wonder to me that somebody didn't write the congressman. Imagine the government paying out all that dough to teach me to fly. 'Why, for me, a landing field is a playground.' 'Teach me to fly?' 'I can fly the crates they come in.' Uh, maybe alright for you monkeys but for me well, I've had over 200 hours in the air. I've done every kind of trick known to an aviator. 'Thrilled millions of people all over the country' 'in every state fair and carnival.' And now, they're gonna teach me how to fly an airplane. Well, personally, between us, I think it's a rib. Attention! Oh, hello, Bill. I didn't know you were here. Carry on. You know, I've just been telling the boys what's wrong with your system here. Yeah, so I heard. Come on outside, Lindbergh, I want to talk to you. You'll love him when you get to know him. Swell guy. - Here, do you want a cigarette? - Yeah, thanks. So listen, Tommy. I wanna tip you off to something. I brought you out here to give you little advice. Why bother? I know all the answers. Oh, sure. I know that. You've been here an hour and a half, you try to run the whole Marine Corps. Gimme another hour, and I'll own the joint. You realize something? You've got me in a spot. You know, I'm responsible for getting you here you know that, don't you? Oh, I did them a favor. Say, listen, you've not only made a bad impression with everybody at the station but to top it all off you made a play for my gal! You don't mean that cute little hug-and-squeeze-- We're practically engaged! You mean, you were. If I didn't have this uniform on I'd punch your ears off. Look here, you don't think you would have everything your own way, do you? Okay. I started out to talk to you like a pal. Now, I'm gonna give it to you like a marine. - Throw away that cigarette. - Oh, come on-- You heard me, throw away that cigarette! Attention! Stand straight! Chest out! Hands by the sides of those funny pink britches of yours. So you wanna be a marine, huh? Well, that's dandy. You're strictly a trick circus-performer and a swell-headed one at that. Why don't you get a load of yourself? Let me tell you something. This outfit is plenty tough to get into but it's easy to get out of. - Well, I can quit-- - Quiet! The Marine Corps only asks for three things. Willingness to learn respect for a superior officer in the uniform he wears and the ability to take orders so he can give them later on and you haven't got any of them, and you never will have. - Now, look here-- - Okay, O'Toole. When I get finished with ya you can pack up that trick uniform because you're a cinch to get sent back to the circus in the morning. Carry on! And he used to be a nice guy. The sticks are now side by side at zero. I'll move one of the sticks and you try to bring it back to zero. 'Now manipulate the cords' 'and when you think you have the stick back at, uh, zero' drop the cord. What am I doing? Playing horsey? Quiet, please. - How am I doing? - That's pretty good. "Pretty good?" It's perfect. Blood pressure a 128 over 86, uh, 84. - Change signals. - Huh. Over here. I want you to put your left foot on that stool and as I raise your hand place your right foot on the stool. As I lower it put it back on the floor again. Alright. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down. Both feet on the floor. Pulse 80, returns in 30 seconds. Figure that score. Plus 18, doctor. - How am I doing? - Excellent. - Naturally. - Pipe down. Alright, this way. This is a Barany chair. I want you to sit in it, and we'll test your equilibrium. Now, uh, place your knees together. Close your fists, placing one on top of the other. 'Now, rest your forehead on top of your fists.' 'And close your eyes.' Now, I'm gonna turn you around to the right five times and at the end, I want you to straighten up. 'Oh, don't be afraid of falling out of the chair.' 'I'll be here to catch you.' 'Alright.' Now, here we go. Straighten up. Alright, now the other way. Straighten up. Reaction's perfect. You're in fine condition, boy. I could've told you that before you started all this nonsense. Hello, Bill. - You sent for me, captain? - I certainly did. And I want to congratulate you. Oh, well, there was nothing else to do, I just had to-- Bring him into the service, and you were right. The medical officer reports that he passed a perfect physical examination, and I congratulate you. Yes, sir. And furthermore, and as much as he'syourprotege I'm giving you the honor of teaching him and I've assigned him to your section for instruction. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. This is called the stick. It controls the flippers and the ailerons. Now, when the stick is pushed forward 'the flippers go down' 'which makes the nose of the ship go down.' 'Now when the stick is brought back, the flippers go up' 'which make the nose of the ship go up.' And these are the rudder pedals. 'You want go to the left, push the left pedal.' 'To the right, the right pedal.' 'Now, the ailerons are also controlled by the stick.' When the stick is moved to the left the ship banks to the left. When the stick is moved to the right the ship banks to the right. 'Now, those are the ailerons that are used' 'for the lateral control.' Hey, O'Toole. Are you, by any chance, getting any of this? "This is known as the stick. "It controls the flippers and the ailerons. '"When you push the stick forward, the flippers go down' "which causes the nose of the ship, my friend, to go down. "When you pull the stick back, it causes the flippers to go up "which causes the nose of the ship, my friend, to go up. - '"Now, the ailerons--"' - Yeah. Ooh! Now, on your first half, I'll take her off then I'll turn her over to you, and we'll practice a few right and left turns. There goes your protege. Yeah. Don't think I'm not watching him. Can you hear me? If you can, pull the cord. Alright, take the stick. Now, give us a little more altitude. Now, let's see what you can do with it. Alright, level off. Alright, I'll take the stick. Well, here we are and back home, and.. ...safe and sound. 'Of all the crazy, stick-nutty fools I've ever known' he's the worst. You can have him for your birthday. He's a pal of yours, if you want him in the Marine Corps you'll have to check-flight him yourself. Well, why didn't you take the stick away from him? I couldn't, he stole my mouthpiece. That's fine, you're lucky he didn't steal the plane. Say, Mitchell, give me my chute and coat. Good morning, lieutenant, and how do you do? Alright, smart guy, this is your first check-flight. And the report I make to the senior instructor tells the story whether you stay or whether you're washed out. Now, you keep that in your skull when you start takin' us-- Don't worry, lieutenant, I can fly-- I know, you can fly the crates they come in. Well, this is no crate. Now, you climb in and keep your eyes on the back of my neck for a while. Here's your flight gear, sir. Okay, fire her up! This telephone is a great thing, O'Toole. I can talk into it, and for the first time in your life, you can't talk back. Now, if your head's not swollen over your ears try and listen. And pay strict attention to my orders. Make a left turn! Climb! Alright, hold this altitude. She's on fire, start slippin' her. No use, Tommy. Bail out before she explodes. Sit still. I can slip her down without singeing an eyebrow. So can I, this is no time to make a hero out of yourself. You heard my orders. Bail out! Alright, general, you first. Here I go. So long, sucker. See you at the mess. Look, he's side-slipping it, to keep the fire away from the gas tank. Sound the crash-siren. Mac. Mac. Hey, Mac! Oh merrily we roll along o'er the deep blue sea Gently, gently, Mac, handle him gently. Gentleness and mercy. Well, what's the matter, ain't you hurt? - I'm alright. - Not even a bone broken? No, not a thing. Sorry to disappoint you. Well, where's Brannigan, maybe I'll have better luck with him. Things got too hot for him, and he bailed out. Now, they oughtn't to have parachutes in them aeroplanes. It ain't fair to the medical department. You know what I'm gonna do, Mac? I'm gonna write to navy department and ask 'em if they will turn this thing into an ice wagon. I've simply got to meet some people. 'Oh, don't tell me this is the second time' 'Brannigan has jumped in the last two weeks.' Yes, but the first time, it was when he was tryin' out the experimental fighter. He's a great guy, tough break. First, a broken flipper-wire then the fire, what's gonna happen the third time? 'He may be a great guy to you with a hard luck' 'but he's "Bail-out Brannigan" to me.' 'And you can excuse me from taking' 'any check-flights with him.' Bill, you didn't really send this? Why not? You don't think I want to stick around the station and be known as "Bail-out Brannigan," do you? Oh, Bill, come on, snap out of it. Sixteen years in the outfit and I have to get this from a little nut that I was goofy about and that's what hurts. It just happened that he was lucky. Disobeyed orders and got away with it. I know, but that doesn't make any difference. Disobeyed orders or not, he saved the ship and that's what counts. Bill. Look, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. Now, the only trouble with you is that your pride's hurt. I thought you were a marine. After 16 years, I should think you would have learned something about fighting. Well, now, wait a minute. You think you've outlived your usefulness at the station? You haven't, Bill. They need you. And so do we. - You mean that, kid? - Absolutely. Well, that settles it, the transfer is off. I'll stay right here. I don't know where I got the idea of running away from a fight anyway. I'll check with the chief instructor. There's no use letting O'Toole get my goat. - Betty, telephone. - Oh, who is it, mother? That nice young man from the station, Mr. O'Toole. - We all love him. - Oh, that's fine. You all love him. He's the guy that sold you the trick plane. - You all love him-- - Wait a minute, Bill. What does he want mother? Mm, nothing, just said he wanted to drop in and browse around a little. Browse, huh? Well, he would. Well, we'll see about that. - Hello. Hello! - Let me talk to him, Bill. He doesn't talk your language, honey. Hello! Say.. Hello! Imagine, that two-timin' rat hung up on me. - Are you listening? - Certainly. I ain't drinkin' with my ears. Alright, kid, you won't have to worry about him anymore. After I see the chief inspector tonight I'll take care of O'Toole. Come on, Bill. I'll walk all the way with you, huh? Well, alright. I got a feelin' I'm going to be took. 'How much does it cost me?' Uh, we don't get you, Ma. What are you luring to? Don't worry. When I was at that phone I've seen Crash with his ear to the ground like a Blackfoot Indian. Me? I don't have to get on no floor to hear you ask O'Toole over. And then hang up. And then call our nibs away from Brannigan. Honestly, I-I couldn't help it, Crash. 'Mr. O'Toole is so nice.' You wont say nothin' about that phone business to Betty and Mr. Brannigan, will ya? Listen, Ma, I may look dumb, but it's only a pose. - I can be gotten to. - What do you mean? Put us on the cuff for these thirty cents. And then give us some of 'em doughnuts to eat on the way over and our mouths will be sealed tighter than a bass drum on the back of a horse in a cavalry band. Get your hand out of there. Your sure O'Toole's comin' over tonight? 'Sure.' Merrily we.. What'd I tell you, Mac, the night was made for love. Give me a pencil and a paper. Hurry, hurry. How do you spell browse? Yes? Aha. You recognize me. Just goes to prove that love will always find a way. I'm sorry, but I'm closing up for the night. You're sorry? You're gonna be over glad when I tell you what I've got planned for us for tonight. What is this big treat you have in store for me? You're lookin' right at it. I'm going to take you home. See, I tossed a coin and.. And I lost. I get it. Goodnight. Well, ha ha ha. Not good, but promising. You just can't help being obvious, can you, sweets? Will you stop calling me "sweets?" And please, tell me what I'm so obvious about? The way you betray your emotions. Look, just see you standin' there you're quivering as though somebody were scratching your back with a nutmeg grater. Oh, you're positively revolting. Hey in the shadows when I come and sing to you-u In the shadows when I come And sing to you In the shadows when I come and sing to you In the shadows The shadows the shadows In the shadows when I come and sing to you In the shadows the shadows Merrily we roll along roll along roll along Merrily we roll along Will you get out of here and leave me alone? I hate you and so does everybody else at the station. They're so sick of your supreme egotism they hate the sight of you. I see, there's where you're wrong. It's not egotism at all it's just self confidence. I know I'm good, so why keep it a secret? Look, it's just as simple, everyday matter of fact that whatever I attempt, I do just that much better than the next guy, so there you are. Oh, you're impossible, you're contemptible swell-headed and fresh. And perhaps, you're too conceited to know it but all the boys in the station are betting five to one you'll be thrown out of the Marine Corp before you make your first solo flight. And a another thing, there are no takers. - I'll take your bet. - How much? The usual, three kisses. - Double it. - It's a bet? Shake hands on it. - What's so funny? - You've won already. The only question now, who kisses who? Oh, get out of here! Get out of here! - You have to hide. - What for? 'Cause I don't want Bill Brannigan to see you here. Well, I'm not afraid of Bill Brannigan. Oh. Come on. In here. - It's an ice box. - I know, but please, for me. Alright. Anything for you, sweets. Here...get me an opener. Oh. Hey, where are you goin'? I have to fetch Lt. Brannigan the OD want's to see him right away. Listen, pal, this means everything to me. I'm just a poor ambulance driver tryin' to get along. I wanna make good, just the same as the rest of you fellas. Look, can't you be a good guy? Break a leg or something, huh? Will ya? Lt. Brannigan. Eh, them Marines.. Lt. Brannigan. - The OD wants you, sir. - Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, but honestly, it was the only place I could think of to hide you. Look, I'll turn on the heater for you. You love me, don't you? Most certainly not. Well, then.. ...why did you wanna hide me, hide me from Bill Brannigan? 'Cause I knew that if Bill socked you it'd cause him a lot of trouble. And that was the only reason you conceited little simpleton. Sendin' me up on a solo flight is a waste of time. Don't worry, buddy, even Limberg had to do it. Oh, I see. Hey, what's the big idea? Just to let the other pilots know that you're a student and warn them to steer clear. Ha ha. Student, my foot. I'll come back with those things in a braid. Yeah, and your skull in a knot. Now, listen, you, here's your orders. Take your plane up, circle once around the bay and bring her down in a three-point landing. I'm laughing. Yeah, well, that's the trouble. Now, you remember what I told you, wise guy. I'll be back in two minutes. And you'll have those students ride me around on their shoulders. Contact! Very pretty, ain't they? Yes, indeed. That was our students. We're lettin' them make their first solo flight today. - What? - You know? Takin' a plane off the ground alone for the first time. Oh, how thrilling. Crash. Very well, Macintosh, you may continue with your first-aid lesson. I have to salute 'em. You see, this is the first point in our graduation. You'll notice, when they land them that's made good, will be hoisted on the shoulders of their classmates and paraded around the field. And then they throw 'em in the bay. You know what that's for? To show, that while they are birdmen they are still soldiers of the sea. Gee, I'd like to go up sometime. Would ya? Would ya really like to go up in the air? Well, uh, look it, uh.. ...if you'd like to go up in the air they got this swell Ferris wheel down at Long Beach and if you're not doin' anythin' some night I certainly would like to pilot you. Hello, Ralf. Oh, excuse me, Ralf. Say, that's a good one. He must be playin' leapfrog. Yeah. There's a perfect three-point landing. - Yeah, but it's O'Toole. - It would be O'Toole. Say, uh, what's the matter? I passed, didn't I? Sure you did. Well, then what's the matter with those guys? Have they got something special arranged for me? Figure it out for yourself. Hiya, sweets. Well, I'm glad you came over to watch me do it. Oh, did you make your solo this morning? Yeah, sure, it was a cinch. The boy's aren't parading me around because it was too easy. I told 'em to hand the cheers to the others who found the goin' tough. Aw! That was very sweet of you. You know, I wasn't gonna tip you off till the last minute but, uh, you're gonna get kind of a break yourself. Oh, by having you talk to me I suppose. No, better than that. I'm gonna ask you to go to the solo party dance with me tonight. Isn't it funny that I get so much out of life and other girls get so little? Yeah, isn't it? What time should I pick you up? Sometime a hundred years from now. No, wait. You wanna go with me, don't you? No. Not even if you're the last man on earth. Alright. Then pay your bet. I made my solo.. ...now kiss me six times. - You're joking? - No, I mean it. - We shook hands on it. - Oh, but-but I-- Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll call the bet off if you go to the dance with me tonight. - No. - No? Alright. Ha ha. - Kiss. - Ugh. I'll go. I'd do anything in the world rather than kiss you. Oh, I see. A dame who doesn't go in for pleasure. - Ooh. - Oh, I'm sorry. Let me kiss it. - Betty? - Yes? - You know something? - What? I think at last I've fallen for someone. Who is this lucky second person?

Eighteen words a minute. Will you raise you right hands? "Having been appointed as second lieutenant "in the Marine Corps Reserve of the United States.. "...I do solemnly swear.. '"...that I will support and defend the constitution' '"of the United States against all enemies..' '"...foreign and domestic.' "And I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. '"And I take this obligation freely' '"without any mental reservation' '"or purpose of evasion.' "And that I will faithfully discharge "the duties of office.. "...on which I'm about to enter. So help me, God." I do. Briefly, the problem is this, gentlemen. The United States, from now on known as Blue is at war with a slightly inferior nation.. ...known as Brown. Now, as Blue, we assume that we've dispatched our entire fleet.. '...together with the Fleet Marine Force' 'to seize a base on an imaginary island' 'just 200 miles off the enemy coast.' The maneuver's open at, uh.. ...daylight tomorrow morning. H-hour. The attacking force, esteemed during darkness to a position just off San Diego. Approximately, like this. Commencing at H-hour.. ...troops will embark in small boats. And proceed.. ...toward the beach.. ...just, uh, just south of La Jolla where the main landing will be made. Our own unit, gentlemen.. ...the Sixth Aircraft Wing.. ...commencing at H-hour and operating from the carrier.. ...will support the landing troops during debarkation during the approach to the shore and during the advancin' in. 'The Fleet Marine Force will leave North Island' and proceed to the aircraft carrier, Saratoga.. ...where they'll be in readiness to take off for the maneuvers. Although your training in squadron will not take part in maneuvers.. ...I want you all to be on the flight deck of the carrier to observe the operations and to fill in on emergency. That's all, gentlemen. Ten seconds before H-hour, sir. What's the range of the enemy fleet? Twenty thousand yards. Clear visibility. - Commence firing. - "Commence firing!" "Commence firing." - "Commence firing!" - "Commence firing!" Fire division ten! Commence laying smoke screen! "Fire division ten! Commence laying smoke screen!" '"Fire division ten!' 'Commence laying smoke screen!"' Command the base force. Disembark landing party. "Command the base force. Disembark landing party." A message for you, sir. Away landing party. Have smoke planes lay protective smoke screen for battle force. Action, command the Air Force. Fighters and bombers take off. Engage enemy planes. Cover landing party and destroy enemy shore defense. "Action, command the Air Force. "Fighters and bombers take off. Engage enemy planes. Cover landing party. Destroy enemy shore defense." Aye-aye, sir. My leg! I can't make it. - Grab this sick man. - Yes, sir. Is that a.. Well, if you're afraid, I'll take it off alone. Nobody's afraid to take her off. I have some.. Drop observation planes before progress. Aye-aye, sir. Smoke planes protect landing party with screen. "Smoke planes protect landing party with screen." Enemy planes and shore defenses reported destroyed. That's swell. Instruct landing party advance to their objective. "Instruct landing party to advance to their objective." The Marines have landed. I have the situation well in hand. The Marines have landed and have the situation well in hand. That's swell. Cease present maneuvers. All forces proceed to their bases. Marine planes return to North Island. That wing is gone. You better bail out. I can't hold it. Keep backin' her. It's our only chance. Don't lose your head! Bail out, I tell you. She's out of control! But if you don't jump, I will. You hold that stick, or I'll plant ya. It took a fire once for me, and hell if I don't live up to it. - You haven't got a chance. - Well, I am gonna take one. It's only a few feet torn off that wing. I'm gonna climb out, and put my weight on it. You keep banking, and try and pick up that landing field. Don't do it, you chum, it's suicide. You said you can fly the crates they come in, didn't you? Well, here's your crate. Fly! Six-Option Two calling FMF Hangar. 'Six-Option Two calling FMF Hangar.' Six-Option Two from FNF Hangar. Go ahead. Pilot.. ...finding an observer.. ...in distress. 'Cracked wing.' 'Altitude, 2,000 feet.' 'We're trying to make landing field.' Uh-huh! Get me operations. That's a thousand to one, they won't make it. Even if they do, that wing will crumble up the minute they hit the ground. There's a man out on that broken wing holding it down with his own weight. Oh, Mac! Oh, Mac. Jump, you idiot. I can hold it, jump! - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. I never thought you'd make it. Well, it's about time you figured somebody else could think besides yourself. Bringing that ship down makes you as good as I am. That's great. That's a step in the right direction. See that landing? Great work, O'Toole bringing that down. Oh, no, no, no. Brannigan did it all. Give it to him. Forget it! It took two of us to bring it down. - Bill. - Hello, darling. Oh, let's scram. You want a ride to the Happy Landing? - No, thanks. - Oh, come on. - Take a little ride. - No, thanks, Crash. Did you hear that, Mac? I can't even get anybody to take a lift! Just a minute, miss. Now, what's your business on government property? Well, if it interests you any, I'm returning a wallet. One of the boys left at my mother's cafe. Okay, I'll see that he gets it. Oh, isn't that sweet of you? Uh, say, Betty.. ...there's something I wanna talk to you about. How about coming over tonight about eight o'clock? Oh, what do you wanna ask me? Well, I tell you, Betty.. ...you and I've known each other for some time about, uh.. ...three years or.. ..two and a half years, somethin' like that. Anyway, the year your mother had that operation for the wart on her thumb What's all that gotta do with what you're gonna ask me tonight? Well, I'll tell you.. ...I was talking to a real estate fellow today.. ...and you'd be amazed at the apartments you can get. Furnished too, and, uh.. Well, uh.. ...uh.. Go, I'll tell you tonight. Oh, now, Bill Brannigan if you don't stop making me curious I really will get angry. Now what'd you wanna ask me? Okay. I'm daffy about you. Will you marry me? Oh, Bill, I.. Oh, I know I don't make a lot of money, but.. It isn't that, Bill-- Of course we can't raise a family right away, but.. What's the matter? You're not saying anything. Won't you, now? Oh, Bill.. ...if you were my brother, I.. ...I couldn't love you or admire you more than I do, but.. But what? Well.. Oh! Brother. I get it. Oh, Bill, I haven't hurt your feelings, have I? Oh, no, honey. I understand everything. And I'm a guy that's hoping it goes through for you too. Good luck, kid. I'll give this to O'Toole. Pretty lucky, boy. Engineer Officer at Quantico, not bad. Sorry to see you go. I'm glad you got it. Thanks, Jimmy. The thing I like about it is Brooklyn's not too far from Virginia. 'Happy landing, Bill.' 'Let me know if there's anything we can do' for you here at the station. Thank you, captain. And I wanna tell you, I certainly enjoyed serving this hitch under you. And I'll never forget it. I wonder if you can do me a favor. Could you hold the ship up for a few minutes? - Sure. - Thanks. O'Toole? 'Hey, Tommy!' Listen, kid. You know why I put off seein' you for the last couple of weeks until now? I had it coming. I know I got into everybody's hair, so it's alright. But the only one thing.. ...I don't like to see you take off this way so will you, uh.. ...put it there.. ...and say all is forgotten? Think you even have to ask me? You're still a little swell-headed though, ain't you? How? Well, you think you're too good for a girl that works behind a counter. Oh, no. It isn't that at all. It's just that, well.. ...I purposely haven't been seeing her because.. ...I know which way the wind blows. Right now, the wind's blowing circles under your hat. Now, listen, you get this. If you think that kiss the other day was anything but friendship.. ...you're crazier than a Chinese kite. Now, you think over that last crack. And see if I don't put casters on your grandmother's crutches. So long, Tommy boy. You just keep flying the crates that come here. - Lieutenant! - Yes, sir. Are you in a habit of passing a senior officer without saluting? - I'm very sorry, sir. - Don't let it happen again. - Yes, sir. - What? No, sir. Hey, you! Are you in a habit of passing a senior officer without saluting? No, sir. We didn't see you, sir. Well, make it your business next time to salute. - 'Yes, sir.' - 'Yes, sir.' How long you've been to service? - 'Not very long, sir.' - That's very obvious. - Fix that tie! - Yes, sir. Now this outfit is hard to get into and easy to get out of. There are only three things we expect of you. Willingness to learn.. ...respect for superior officer and the uniform he wears and the ability to take orders, so you can give them later on. - Yes, sir. - Now don't let it happen again. - 'No, sir.' - Ow! What do you mean by talking about me to Bill Brannigan? Oh, what'd I say? You said that you love me. That's a gross understatement. Carry on! Carry on.
