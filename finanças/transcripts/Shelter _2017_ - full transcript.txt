[woman] Life is an island in the ocean of loneliness, an island whose rocks are hope, whose trees are dreams, whose brooks are thirst, and whose flowers are solitude. [mystical music playing] [music intensifying] [beeping] Long time. [intense music playing] Nice touch. [car engine starts] [lift door opens] Hello? I am Claudia Weber. Pleased to meet you. [Mona] Did you lock the door? Of course. Where are you from, Claudia? I"m from Wolfsburg. My husband worked there for five years but was wounded, and can"t work anymore. This is my first time serving as companion. Well, my name is Mona. But that"s not my real name, just as yours is not Claudia. We are together in this for two weeks, and we both know our parts by heart. So all you have you do is to be nice to me, and you can start by making me coffee. Here are the rules, Mona: You never leave the apartment unless I tell you to. You never open the door to anyone no matter what. And you stay away from the windows at all times. Easy. [soft background music playing] [bell tolling] What about breakfast? We have nothing here expect disgusting frozen food. I"ll see what I can do. So obvious a man has bought it all. [siren blaring] [reporter] In Beirut, more than 20 people were killed in last night"s failed assassination attempt on Naim Ayash, Chief of Staff of the Lebanese organization Hezbollah. Both Israel and the US hold Ayash responsible for terror attacks on Israeli and American targets worldwide, including the attack on the Israeli Embassy in Kenya two years ago. Israeli sources denied any involvement, but a Hezbollah spokesman vowed revenge. Our enemy has blood on its han, the blood of innocent women and children, but the enemy will never reach our prince, Naim Ayash. They cannot touch him. My father always told me to never trust you. "Never trust the Jews," he said. "Suspect them. Respect if you have to, but always suspect." Sure you made the right choice. No, I totally messed up. I put everything I had on you because I believed you"re different, I don"t even know why. It"s madness. [phone rings] Is it your people? [phone rings] Don"t answer. It"s nothing. Wrong number. [phone rings] They know I am here. No one knows you"re here. They know, and they know that I am afraid, and fear is a weapon. I will never make it out of here. We are going to have a wonderful breakfast, and you"ll be just fine. Trust me. Trust you? Why should I trust you? I don"t trust anyone. [orchestral music playing] We say to the countries that are participating in the crusaders campaign, I swear to God, just like what your friends went through, you will go through. I swear to God. One day, all Europe will be like that. You will see. We are the only people who can do something. We are culture, we are hope, we have a responsibility towards humanity. You think I would be where I am now looking like a monster if I did not believe in this? Damn stitches. The doctor told me to put this stinky cream every day. I will need you to help me. I wish I could just go already, and not have to wait these two weeks. [narrator on TV] In 1944, Asmahan, second only to the king, was found dead near Alexandria, Egypt. She was only 26. Numerous conspiracy theories surrounded her death... Everybody wanted her dead. The ones she loved, and the ones she hated. They left her out there to die like a dog on the street, just like I will. I won"t let that happen. You really think it"s up to you and me? [song continues on TV] [suspenseful music playing] I have news for you. Good news. We all know where your package is, and we"ll see you in Germany. Mona? Mona? [phone rings] [suspenseful music playing] [lift clangs] What"s wrong with you? What happened? Where did you go? What"s he doing here? I just went to look for this fine gentleman because the water was flooding. It"s the water pipes. Should have been replaced a long time ago, but Frau Hermann is cheap, and it"s her building now. Before the war, it belonged to a Jewish family. They hid in this apartment. I think right here. What can you do? This apartment is cursed. Don"t do it again. Understood? Give me your keys. I am not your prisoner. I go wherever I want. No. There are rules, and you will respect them. You do not go anywhere, you do not talk to anyone, and you do as I say, understood? I"m alone in this, anyway. No, you"re not. We"re in this together, now give me your keys. [door opens] - [door closes] - Mona. [door opens] You want the keys, take them. I don"t care. [door closes] [suspenseful music playing] I hope you are ready for me. Who knows what I will look like? Did they show you my old face? No. I had such beautiful hair. They cut it all off. Your hair feels nice. I feel blonde today. Do you feel blonde sometimes? Never. [exhales heavily] [phone rings] [doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] Frau Hermann, so nice to see you. Who are you? I don"t know you. Let me make you a cup of tea. Poor woman. Loneliness is the worst curse you can suffer from. Only love can cure it, and love is so hard to find. I had love once. It was beautiful. No one touched me like he did. No one. He was married, of course, but I didn"t care. He was a Muslim, still I didn"t care. I did everything for him. I felt I found the love of my life. But love turns into hate. And now, he"s the reason I"m here. Show me your hand. It"s all about bluffing and deception. I am sure you can teach me about those. God plays poker with us. The problem is we always lose. [indistinct announcements over P.A.] [suspenseful music playing] [children laughing, indistinct conversations] [siren wailing] [traffic sounds, distorted conversations] [doorbell ringing] Let them take me, save yourself! [door slams] [Mona] Claudia! [intense music playing] [gun shot] Are you OK? I"m trying to have a baby. My husband and I tried to have a baby many times, but it didn"t work. This is the first time I"m trying since he... Since he what? Since he left you? I married young. We had an exciting life together. Lots of memories. But what are memories worth? You can"t touch them. What do you mean? I lost him. Micky. I lost him. We were stationed in Africa. Kenya was a battlefield between us and Hezbollah. One morning, I took Micky to his work at the embassy. He kissed me, he said, "I"ll see you later, honey." And then a car showed up from nowhere, and I tried to reach for my gun, but I froze. They tried to shoot me. Micky took the hit, didn"t have a chance. Three days later, I gave up on trying. Became a memory. God knows how much you deserve a child. I am sure you will succeed. I don"t know what God knows. Stand up. Come on. Stand up. Who will be the father? Someone I"ll never see. A donor, number 749. Brown hair, brown eyes, normal. You know her deep desire for a child. A little one to love and to hold, to care for, to cherish. Grant that her body make her receive a beautiful, healthy baby. Amen. There. My mother would cook Salad du Jour once a week. We say, "Ant tamla kabdaa bifarh." Means "you fill my liver with joy." But my mother would always add a lot of chili just to make sure I remember that love burns you. She was a great cook. But she died young and left me with a father who could not cope with me. I was too wild for him. He really hates me. I had to play my cards right every single day of my life, with my father, my brothers, my lovers... they all try to cheat me. And us... why did you trust us? Who says I did? Maybe I should ask why did we trust you? Simple. Your people knew which buttons to push, and they understood what I am worth for them and what I expect in return. And I don"t mean money. So what do you mean? [banging on door] [car engine starts] I miss my son so much. You have a son? Did you tell us? Anyone? They didn"t tell you? There was no time. We had to leave in a rush, and it was too dangerous for your people to reach him in time. I had no choice but to leave him behind. They promised they will bring him to me. But where is he? Who is he with? Come on, you know you can trust me. He"s safe... for now. Do you have a photo of him? Ziad... No. It was not allowed to take any photos. [Claudia] And where"s his father? - Who is he? - You don"t want to know. - Why? - You just don"t. All I can say is that he betrayed him... and me. I will have him kidnapped and brought to me. I have my connections, you will see. I"ll go myself if I have to. [melancholy music playing] Claudia. Yes? Do you ever get scared? Scared of what? Of everything... Yes. Sometimes, yes. Me, too. I am terrified. I just want my son. [indistinct conversations, light jazz music playing] The point is this: we know there are at least two, if not three, cells moving around Europe ready to strike at any moment. Unfortunately, we don"t have enough intelligence coming in or through the Americans. We share the same problem. We always share the same problems, my friend. I don"t have to tell you how things work these days. The Americans have one thing in mind now, and that"s ISIS. To fight them, they need Iran, Iran stands behind Hezbollah, so America has to deliver a present, a present that the Hezbollah are desperate to have. You know who that present is. I am not giving presents to anyone. I am sure my boss is feeling the same way. I"m serious, Bernard. I know you are. And I don"t like it either, but... this is beyond both of us. Come on. I stopped buying these things a long time ago, and I thought you did, too. I should be going now. No, just the check, please. My treat. Gad, there is no need to be upset. The enemy of my enemy is my worst enemy, and his worst enemy is getting closer, it"s getting out of control, a real threat to all of us. So now you can see why the Americans are inviting new partners to bed for a big, wide orgy. Tomorrow, it could be different. Nothing is carved in stone, nothing is signed with blood. We don"t work this way. We take care of our people. She is not one of your people. [reporter] They beat and demand revenge as the man accused of spying for Israel was executed on the streets of Beirut. If I could, I would put two bullets into the head of the man who betrayed me. Two bullets. Betrayal cannot be forgiven. You will never betray me, right? I am here to protect you. Those were exactly his words. "I am here to protect you. You are the love of my life." I should have known. A man who betrays his wife cannot be loyal to anyone, not even his son. We never learn, do we? I know what you"re thinking. "This woman betrayed her people, and she"s talking about betrayal." No. Of course you are. I have no regrets. I did the right thing. [alarm blaring] [suspenseful music playing] Mona, we have to go. It"s a trap. It"s always a trap. No, it"s not. It"s OK. Come on, let"s go. I can shoot you, run away, they will never find me. What"s wrong with you? Give it to me. I can use it right now and put an end to all this misery. [firefighter vehicle siren] Do you know how many times I thought of doing it? [pounding on door] We will go from here. Come on, come on. We will wait. Claudia, I want to tell you something. If anything bad happens, if you feel you can"t trust anyone, not even your own people... I don"t think I... Listen to me, there is only one man in this world we can go to, his name is Ahmet Kayam. He"s at the Kurdish Cultural Center in Cologne. He will recognize me immediately. He is one of the Israeli people we can trust with closed eyes, really. It will be over soon. Tomorrow is Ziad"s birthday. He will be eight. My little angel. Thank you. This one is from you. It"s so cute. Should give it a name, I call him, Fareed, Fareed the bear. He talks, you know, in German. Why are you hiding them? You"re so beautiful. I just don"t understand why you don"t wear makeup? I can show you how to do it like a Lebanese princess. You are getting ready for the night clubs. I"m not the clubbing type. With this body and this pretty face... Come on. Perfect. You could have been a top model. Claudia Sabesta! If I was a man, I would go crazy about you. Luckily, you are not a man. Even as a woman. I wish we could take a photo, just so we can remember each other. Smile. When I was 12, we lived in Germany because my father worked here at the Embassy. My parents sent me to Catholic school because they were told it is better than the Jewish one. I had to pray to Jesus every morning, and to confess my sins, of course. Then my father met a German woman, and in no time, he was gone. My mother never stopped loving him. I never spoke to him again. [doorbell ringing] [door closes] Mona? I"m so happy to see you. I am ready. I have been waiting for this all night. Good luck. [reporter] German authorities have raised the terror alert level to its highest, level 4. The news comes in response to what officials called a serious and eminent threat to Germany"s major cities. Authorities did not say what specifically prompted raising the threat level, but sources say at least four terrorist cells are out and about Germany and might strike at any given moment. I have to get the last injection tomorrow to avoid swelling during the flight. I hate my face, it looks fake. It"s a sin to change your face. It"s not a sin to save yourself. You really think so? I do. And I also think you must be starving, and we have to celebrate our last night together. Getting drunk is exactly what I need. Mona Rice, Canada. Better to hide these. I will give them to you tomorrow before you leave. My ticket to freedom... or hell. Business class. See, we take care of you. Now let"s eat. I don"t know what I will do tomorrow. I hope I won"t go crazy and do something stupid. Claudia, tell me your real name. Come on. Just so that I know, that"s all. I"m Lina. Lina Haddad. I was Lina Haddad. Naomi. Nice to finally meet you, Naomi. I am sorry. I just had to do it to remember your taste. Now you will stay with me forever... and maybe I will stay with you. [man] Who is it? A friend. Naim. - Hi. Hello. - Hello. Please, join us. [clock chiming] Morning. You"re up early. I know, but I"m ready, I just don"t want to think about anything anymore. You look great. You"re just saying this to make me happy. You hungry? You want me to make you some breakfast? No, nothing. OK, so while you"re at the doctor, I"m going to get something for my mom. Hmm. [doorbell ringing] - Good morning. - Good morning. [melancholy music playing] [music continues] [horn honking] Mona, are you back? [phone ringing] Mona? [phone ringing] - Fuck. Mona! - [gun shots] [gun shot] [gun shot] [horn honking] [ambulance siren] - [phone ringing] - [ambulance siren] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Avner. First time here? Your first time, try the lamb. It"s the best. Lina told me to try the chicken. Lina? Lina. She said you would help me if I"m in trouble. There"s a war out there, and we"re losing it. We? The Kurds are the Jews of the Arab world, that is why we bonded with your people a long time ago. We have common enemies, and latest one is brutal and frightening. How do I know we are on the same side? Look at my face, do you trust it? Faces can be deceiving. True. But for now, I am your best option, Mrs. Rimon. And Avner is a friend. He had to go underground for a while, I am on your side, just like I was on Lina"s side. But Lina was out of this game. She was done. You are never done, you are never out. Her son? What can be done to save him? Ziad... on life support. His father probably reached him before anyone else could. His father is who I think he is? His father is not a very good man, that"s all I can say. I can"t get Ziad out of my mind. I owe her at least that. You are a very generous and kind person. And I can see people"s hearts through their eyes. I can see yours. Your eyes do not lie. I don"t know, I never look into my eyes. You should, you will learn a lot... and you will see that life is an island in an ocean of loneliness. It"s Gibran Khalil Gibran, not me. Yes. You should follow your heart. Meanwhile, you are safe with me. So you will have a good night sleep, and tomorrow, you will know what to do. Then I can help you, and I"ll organize everything you need. [Lina] Naomi, would you promise me something? In case anything goes wrong... Why would anything go wrong? Just in case, promise me you will take him out. Just promise me. Tell me where he is. What is the purpose of your visit? Business, I"m a computer engineer. Take a step back and wait here. [phone ringing] Welcome to Lebanon, Mrs. Rice. [knocking on door] Mrs. Rice, I have a package for you. [crying] [gun shot] [no audible dialogue] [woman on P.A.] Welcome to Toronto Pearson International Airport. Please have all documents ready for inspection. Canadian citizens, follow the green line. All visitors, follow the red line. [Lina] My dear... [sighs] I don"t even know what to say. God always wins in poker, but sometimes, only sometimes, we have the upper hand. Thank you. Take care. [sighs]
