Come, leif. There's someone here to see you. Just get someone else to take over the shop. How hard can it be? Dad's never there anyway. That's because I'm there. I don't want to go without you. I need my brother in America. Now we can both do what we do best. You'll skate, I'll run a business. Is that what you want? Yes. Then I won't go. Of course you're going. Give me a ticket. I like her. Sonja? Are you ready? Right, dad? Let's call leif. - He needs to get over here. - Certainly. Hello? Have I reached henie fur? I'm an old lady calling from Los Angeles. I'm in desperate need of a fur. It is your closing-out sale, right? Yes. Would you bring me a fur? Absolutely. First! Go, Sonja! Why didn't gerd come with you? You could live here, you know. It would be too crowded. You, me, mom, dad and gerd? You're my family. It's not that simple. So the business went bust. That's in the past now. Not for dad. You'll have to think of something. What? I don't have any skills. We'll start a business. You can be the ceo. Come. Let's play bandy. Nice, leif! Pass the ball, leif! Here! Dad! Yeah! Get over here. Not bad! Goodness me. Go! Let go! Here! Get the ball, leif! - Yes! - It was out. - It was in. - The ball was out. No way, it went past his foot. - It's in! - I saw it! That's impossible. - The ball was out. - Yeah, right. Mom? The ball is in when it's past dad's foot, right? Blow the whistle. - The ball was out! - It was in. This is bullshit. Fuck! Leif... Niels! Oh my god! You came! Thanks. - You want one of these? - I'll take all I can get. Finally reunited. Cheers. Cheers. So, are you here to stay? - Sure, in New York. - It's warmer here. Definitely. - Is it? - Yes. As far as I'm concerned, most of my clients are European, so the Atlantic is where it's at. Sonja. Time for bed. What? Nine o'clock? We're starting at five in the morning. We're coloring the ice black. Maybe you'd like to come visit the set? L... I've got an early flight tomorrow. Maybe some other time. It would be easier if you lived here. Yeah. It's much better here, isn't it? Oh, you mean here? Right. Well... Well, why not? Yeah. You'll have to promise to come back soon. Leif. I brought something from Norway. It's from when we were little. - What? - I crushed you at bandy. What's this? It's me! This is going up on the wall right away. Just... Let me know if you're in New York. We'll play some bandy. Or something. Are you coming? Sure. Watch out for that one. He's a cheater. Come on! Niels! Niels, come stand next to leif and Sonja. We're having a match! Selma, hurry. Sonja? Come here. Can you do that again? - Where did you learn that? - Leif taught me. Please welcome our next contestant. Pack your things. You can untie your skates yourself. That's enough. There. You have to get up at five. You'll wake me. Bye. - Here. - Thanks. Have a nice trip! There. Cheers. What's this? I've found a piece of land. Not far from your place, a few miles down the coast. You're going to be a farmer? I have to do something. I'm a business man, after all. You were a business man. It's just some lots. I might buy a couple. Why don't we get all of them? We have a business, right? You can build a village. Plots or houses. It's going to be expensive. If it's not expensive, it's cheap. You should do something you know. I should get leif's wife down here so they can start making little sonjas that I can teach to skate. It's my money. I think it's an excellent idea. What's the ground like? Is it flat? - Sunny, shady...? - Quite flat. Remember to smile, gerd. Try to... Laugh a little. You know what I mean. Overbearing. You can rub my feet. It's the new pair. They're so tight, half of my foot is numb. Dad? First! Hey. There you are. The car's ready. I found your old skates a few days ago. You should bring them for little Wilhelm. Yeah. Maybe. They're yours, after all. Thank you. Hey... There have been some delays at henie hills. The bank won't give us any money before it's done. How much do you need? Well... Is mom all right? Sure. She says hello. - More? - Maybe a little. That'll do. Thanks. Why the hell did you pick this car? I thought it was a lovely car. - And now? - That it was a bad idea. Fuck! Are you done sulking? Leif, come on! Leif! We're over here. Nice! - How are you feeling? - Great. Nobody speaks english. Cheers. Hello, there. Niels! It's so good to see you. So, you're... How fun. Good to see you, niels. You, too. - Where are you staying? - At leif's. You could have stayed here. Yes, but I wanted to see the kids. - Cheers. - Cheers. Well, he's right. Come hug your aunt Sonja. They've taken almost all of my cars. Next, they'll take my house. There's nothing left in the bank. You should never have fired Arthur. Shut up. I need money, and you've taken everything I have. You mean everything you've been given. I've followed you my whole life. Henie hills is my project. And I paid for it. So... What do you say? You're not getting any money. Winnie left me. He was only interested in your money. And you weren't? Mom? Why don't we have a look at your will, one of these days? Sure. Of course we can. Good. I'll call you. Sun, ice, skates. Mommy, daddy, leif. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. Sun, skates, mommy, daddy, leif. - Boo! - Sonja! What are you doing? The papers are signed, so the will should be sorted. That's great. What is this? Okay, let's go. Let's go. We're leaving. You're scared of her! I wish I never taught you how to skate. Pack your things, mom. You're staying with me. I accept the following. One: To transfer to Sonja henie, whenever she pleases, my share of the property at landgen, Oslo, Norway, as well as all the furniture in said property. To issue and transfer to my daughter when she sees fit." Drunk! You've lived off my money all your life. Freeloading and whining. Feeling sorry for yourself. Didn't get to go to school because we lived in finse. The business failed because of the war. You know what you are? You're nothing. You get everything, and you sell henie hills? Nice of you to stop by. Are you here for work? No, I... Look at you. Yes. I went to see leif. Henie hills is all he has. Yes. That's... Let's see... Bought it yesterday. That's why I'm in Los Angeles. To buy art? A year from now, it will have doubled in value. Oh. It's that easy? Well, most of it hever amounts to much. But this one will. It kind of looks like skating trails. Yeah? You're giving me an autograph? What are you thinking? That I'll put it on my wall so I can brag about knowing you? I didn't invite you in here to get told off. I'm sorry. You've always liked me, niels. In many ways, it's always been the two of us. I think I'll... Be off. Did I say something wrong? It's always been the two of us? Yes? Bye. Don't go. I want you to stay. Why? I like you. I told you, I've always liked you. No, you said that I've always liked you. What's the difference? So, tomorrow the money from henie hills will be transferred to some ice hall in rio, is that right? Yes. Well, I'm letting him keep his house. Not his livelihood, though. Leif's a terrible business man. I've been paying for that place all along. I probably would have done so the rest of my life. Do you think you'll make money again? How rude. I think you should go to the kitchen. Sit down and think it over. Oh? Think what over? What's going to happen. What do you think will happen? I think rio is going to be a disaster. You're going to lose what little you have left. Right. You should stay, if you want me to think. I'm not going to sit here and think by myself. What will you do instead? Get so plastered that you forget where you are? Yes. Right. I'd love to see you in rio. Yeah. Sonja henie and niels onstad married in the summer of 1956 Together they built up a substantial art collection Sonja henie died the following year on a flight from Paris to Oslo she had leukemia and fell asleep with niels' head on her shoulder leif and Sonja never saw each other again. I glance at her face to see if it's been damaged by the Hollywood make-up. Subtitles: Froydis er(Es meteoritt as
