This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Noelle, it's Greg. Listen. I realize Christmas falls on one of your days, but Dina and I believe Henry should spend the holiday with us. When Henry sees how Dina has decorated the place, he's going to love it. And let's be honest. Our home provides more of a family-like atmosphere, which is what our son needs. Call me and we'll discuss. Henry? Come here, bud. ♪ Ta-da ♪ What do you think? Okay. I know the tree is a lot smaller than what we're used to, but it's kind of pretty, right? It's small, but it's great, Mom. We are going to have the best Christmas ever. - Promise you. - I know we will. All right. Well, I got to get ready for work. - Love you. - Love you. Radio announcer: And if you haven't seen the latest forecast, looks like we'll be getting a special gift from Mother Nature. A white Christmas. You call that a gift? So, how about we get into the holiday spirit with a Christmas classic? ♪ Ding-dong, ding-dong ding-dong ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-ding ♪ ♪ Ding-dong, ding-dong ding-dong ♪ ♪ Ding-dong-ding ♪ ♪ Santa, won't you hurry ♪ ♪ Down the chimney ♪ The nerve of this kid. Hey. Kick that ball against my wall one more time and I'll confiscate it. What do you mean? It's hardly leaving a mark. Are you back-talking me? Maybe. That's it. Give me the ball. You can have it back once your parents know what you done. - Ha-ha! You can't catch me. - Oh, yeah? I can catch you. I got you. Come on, kid. Mr. Geir, what are you doing outside half-dressed? - It's freezing. - Never mind that, Luis. I almost slipped. Can the condo board not afford salt? Oh, no. Did you fall? - No, but I could've. - But you're okay? That's not the point. That kid got away from me. What kid? Forget about it. Hey, bud. Mom, hurry. We have to go. What? Where are we going? You promised me last night that we could go to Heidi's Bakery. I did? And if we don't go soon, the fresh banana bread - will be all sold out. Come on. - Okay, okay, okay. - Come on. Let's go. - I'm going, Henry. Hi. I'm Shannon, and this is my daughter Katie and her dance team, and we are caroling for charity. Unfortunately, I have a very important... What's your favorite Christmas song, mister? I don't have one. You don't? Not really a big fan of Christmas songs. Not even "The Twelve Days of Christmas"? Especially not "The Twelve Days of Christmas." I know one you'll like. "Jingle Bells." But the version with the funny lyrics. Everybody likes that one. You think so, huh? Look. I'm sorry, but I really have to... Hit it! Hold on, girls. Please, no. Stop. ♪ Jingle bells, your breath smells, jingle all the way ♪ I really have to... ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh ♪ You're not going to stop singing, are you? ♪ Jingle bells, your breath smells, jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what ♪ Wow. You know what? That gentleman didn't deserve any Christmas cheer, did he? Let's move on. You girls sounded great. Mom, there's probably something I should tell you. Yeah? What is it? Well, you know how you said I could practice in the neighborhood as long as I don't cross the street? Mm-hmm, and don't bother any of the neighbors. Right. Well, today, this grumpy guy threatened to take my ball away. Who? The guy in 224. He even chased me. He chased you? Well, he has a cane, so I got away. I am not okay with this. Henry, are you sure you didn't do anything to bother him? No. Crazy, right? Well, when we get back, I'm going to have a word with this guy. I don't think that's such a good idea. I mean, what kind of guy chases a kid just for kicking a ball around? I guess you're right. You got to promise me that you're going to stay away from him. Oh, for sure. Mom, I'm sorry I cause trouble sometimes. I know things have been tough since Dad left. It's okay. I got you, don't I? - Always. - Always. Whoa. Looking good, Luis. That's great. Oh, thank you. - See you later. - Bye. Hey. What's wrong? When we were caroling on your street, we ran into a real bah-humbug. What happened? This guy literally slammed the door in our face right as we were about to get to the good part of the song. Oh, no. That's terrible. - I'm so sorry. - I know. Word to the wise. Stay away from the guy in 224. 224? That's the Scrooge that threatened to take away my ball earlier. What is this guy's deal? Maybe he's mad about being on the naughty list. Maybe. I told her not to take it personally. You never know what someone else is going through, right? Right. When can I hear your beautiful caroling? We're going again tomorrow. You promise you're going to stop by my place so I can hear your singing? Good. Head upstairs, bud. Get your stuff. Okay. - Be good for Aunt Shannon. - I always am. I know. Do you want to go inside and see his bunny? Now, she's happy. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey. Did you think about that date Friday night? Mark will set it up. I just don't think it's a good time right now. Well, it's never a good time, but you deserve to be happy. The right guy will understand your priorities. Okay. Fine. Attagirl. Hi there. There you are. Thank you very much. See you next time. Hey. Uh, you know that you're... parked... Hey. Guess what. Yeah. I, uh, have a permit. I'm sorry. It's okay. Honestly, I only try to use the pass when I'm coming in for a minute. Just, uh, picking up some takeout. What is your name? - Jeremy. - Jeremy. I'm Noelle. Ah. The, uh, French word for "Christmas." Ah. A man who knows that. I take it this is your favorite time of year. Actually, it's my least favorite. Okay. But, um, Noelle is a beautiful name. Thanks. Um, your total is $17.97. - Do you need help? - Nope. - I can manage. - Thanks. Perfect. Oh. Uh, Jeremy, don't you want your change? Keep it. It's $32, though. I'm sure you deserve it. Okay. Thanks. Come back if you like the burger. Jeremy, my man. Hey, Frank. How you doing? I'm good. Hey, listen. My wife and I were talking, and there is this sweetheart of a gal that we want to set you up with. What's with the eye-roll? I doubt I'm her type. Come on. How can you say that? Well, for starters, I... Oof! Whoa, man! Are you okay? You asking me or my ego? Oh, Mr. Geir, what happened? Well, I just tripped on this extension cord, which someone carelessly stretched across the street. I'm so sorry. The tenants voted to display a bigger tree than ever. I had to draw power from two units or I'd blow a fuse. Maybe you could reroute the power cables. Of course. I will. But you have to admit it looks lovely, doesn't it? No. It's obnoxious. Better yet, take it down. Mr. Geir, it's a symbol for the holidays. People love it. In this day and age, isn't it a little bit unfair to be featuring Christmas? If you're going to have a tree, why don't you celebrate all the other holidays? Where's the menorah? My apologies. I didn't know you were Jewish. I'm not Jew... You're missing my point. Take the tree down so no one else gets hurt, okay? Mr. Geir, it's not that easy. It has to go through the board. Well, maybe I'll just go tell the board about this little incident with the extension cord. Okay, Mr. Geir. But if I may make one small request... What? Please don't sue me. Can we circle back to your love life for a quick sec? How bad do you want me to feel today? I'm trying to lift your spirits, buddy. Her name is Hailey, and after I told her about you, she said you sounded, and I quote, "delightful." Then you've clearly deceived the woman. Okay. You do have your moments, but I know there's a heart in there waiting to get thawed out. Can I be frank with you, Frank? Of course. Ever since my stroke, I've had this pent-up bitterness over the fact that it derailed my life, and certain things trigger it, especially Christmas. I'm working on it, okay? I know you are. That kind-hearted, sensitive guy that I grew up with is still in there somewhere. We just got to coax him back out again. Maybe a date with Hailey will do the trick. You are relentless. Think about it. All right. All right. Thank you. Let's hope they work. Okay. Oatmeal. Ah. Hey. Jeremy, right? Yeah. Hi. Hi. Oh, yeah. I know. Turns out it happens every month. They didn't teach you that in biology class? Of course. So, how was the burger the other night? Messy. Messy? Oh, that's not good. I got to talk to the cooks about that. Well, it was, uh... I tripped when I got home, and the burger and I took a tumble. Oh, no. Are you okay? Oh, yeah. It was salvageable, actually, and quite delicious. Good. So, you'll be back? Yeah, I think so. Well...(clearing throat)... in case you forgot, my name... is Noelle. I remember. Jeremy, can I ask you something? Absolutely. I'm a little conflicted... over which cereal to buy. There's just so many choices. Yeah. It's a bit of a conundrum, isn't it? Yeah. If you were having breakfast, what would you pick? Well, for me, it's oatmeal. Deep down, I'm really just an 80-year-old man. Oh, no. There's nothing wrong with oatmeal. Oatmeal is great. I'm just looking for something a bit more exciting. Mmm. I did always like Sweet Pops when I was a kid. Mmm. Got to have my pops. And then there's Frozen Flakes. Always a good choice. They're grrreat! Sounds like you watched just as much TV as a kid as I did. When it comes to cereal, what I look for these days is fiber content. Yeah. I said that out loud, didn't I? - You did, yeah. - Mm-hmm. But I think I'm going to go... Tiny O's. Good choice. Good choice. Has everything you need. Sugar, artificial flavors and artificial colors. - Mmm. Does it, really? - Mm-hmm. Mommy, I want this one. Hello. Mommy, what's wrong with that man? Maddie, shh. It's not polite to stare. But look at his arm. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Kids. They're so innocent, until proven guilty. Yeah. Um, I should get going. Maybe I'll see you at the diner. Uh, sure. Luis, why are you taking the tree down? - It was stunning. - Mmm. We have to get rid of it. Why? Uh, Mr. Geir complained. He said it was obnoxious and a liability, and the condo board agreed. - Obnoxious? - That's what he said. Luis, Mr. Geir wouldn't happen to live in 224, would he? - Oh. You know him? - No. I mean, I never met him, actually. Just kind of seems like a total jerk. Yes. Well, I just started this new thing where I'm trying really hard not to judge others, so I'm going to leave that one alone. Well, good luck. - See you later. - Thank you. - Noelle. - Hi. I'm so glad you got here before Bert. - Okay. Yeah? Why is that? - It's no big deal. There's just a couple of things you ought to know before you meet him. I'm so sorry. I'm just finding out about all this now. Okay. Like what? Minor things. I mean, nothing horrible. No. You guys, you're making it sound like I'm being set up with some sort of nutcase. No, no. I don't... I don't... No. Mark? Uh, would we call Bert a nutcase? - Maybe more like an outsider. - Mark! That's not very convincing. I should go check on the roast. Shannon, what have you gotten me into? He wasn't even on social media, so I couldn't look him up. I know. I know. I thought that was refreshing, until I found out why. Okay. And why? He's been banned from all social media platforms. What? Banned? Just from spreading misinformation, mostly. Oh, my gosh. It's fine. He has a lot of good qualities. Like? He's single. That's not a quality. I baked a new dessert. - Shannon? - Yeah. Chocolate. It's so good. You said he's cute, right? - Like, and you think he's cute? - I do. He's here. He's here. I can't believe you're making me do this. You're doing this. Let's go. Wow. Your house is very clean. - Thanks. - Hi. Allow me to introduce you to my lovely sister. Well, that's why I'm here. This is Noelle. Hi. You mean you want a fist bump? No, I don't do handshakes. Uh, germs. Boom. Boom. Can I get you something to drink, Bert? Sure. Something non-alcoholic and non-carbonated. Oh, and nothing with any artificial colors or flavorings, or high-fructose corn syrup. Okay. So, tap water good? Is it filtered? - I'm pretty sure, yeah. - Hmm. All right. That's fine. Yep. Mark? Um, I can have some water as well. My mouth suddenly feels very dry. - You got it. - Yeah. I'm going to go help Mark with the prep, and that way, you two can get to know each other. Okay. My sister, she's a really great cook. - Hmm. - Yeah. - So, Noelle... - Mm-hmm? Are you one of those people who believe our planet is actually round, hmm? And that is why I believe castor oil makes for a much more effective purgative. Um, there's a lot of information to absorb, Bert. Here you go. So, has anyone read any great books lately? Oh, I only read nonfiction. Is that so? Yeah. I mean, who would want to read a story somebody just made up? I heard that you prefer made-up stories. How do you mean? Oh, come on, Bert. Some of the greatest books ever written are fiction. I mean, think of the novels of Twain, Dickens. Jane Austen. Who? Listen. Fiction is pointless. Nonfiction is real. It teaches us something. Well, I probably should not ask you if you've seen any great movies lately, then. Oh, don't even get me started on movies. Uh, why don't we eat up while it's still hot? Yes. Let's focus on eating as quickly as possible. Hello, Greg. Noelle? Huh. I thought you were avoiding my calls. I've just been kind of busy trying to keep up with all the bills, which you clearly are not helping with. Come on. You know the lawyers are still sorting all that out. I want to talk about our son and this Christmas. You got my last message, right? Yeah, I did. Sounds like you have an interesting take on what constitutes a more family-like environment for our son. It's his home, Noelle. Which you chose to move your mistress into. I'm not going to rehash the past with you. And I'm not rehashing our separation agreement with you. Christmas falls on my day, and I plan to make it the best Christmas that he's ever experienced. And then you can have him on the 26th, like we agreed upon. Noelle, I just... Merry Christmas, Greg. - 'Morning, sis. - You don't knock? I think we both know there isn't much of a chance of walking in on you with someone. Where's my little buddy? Um, he'll be down in a minute. I am so sorry about last night. Oh, it's okay. It's just a good reminder that I should never say yes to a blind date ever again. Whoa. I don't know about that. Sometimes you got to roll the dice, right? Yeah, but I have to be careful. I need to know that I have a connection if I'm going to invest my time with someone. Mm-hmm. Is there someone you're feeling that connection with? I mean, okay. There's this guy. Yeah? Maybe I'm being delusional, but I really feel like there's something there. And? I'll tell you about it later. Henry? Get down here. Aunt Shannon is here. I got to get to work. Thanks so much, as always. I want to hear more about this guy. I will tell you all about him, if I ever bump into him again. Remember what Frank said. The old Jeremy is in there somewhere. He has to be. Hailey? Jeremy. I thought that must be you. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Sorry. Just force of habit. - It's fine. - Frank mentioned it. It's nice to meet you. So, uh, I went inside, but they said that the wait is going to be over an hour. Ah, I should have made a reservation. I'm really sorry. I didn't think it'd be so busy on a Thursday. Well, Thursday is the new Friday. I guess so. Well, if you're good with something casual, there's a great little diner down the street. The jacket and tie might suggest otherwise, but I'm good with casual. - Let's go. - All right. Is there a problem? Uh, no, no. It's fine. You said you were cool with casual. Yeah. I am. - After you. - Okay. Oh. Does this happen often? Uh, no. I just need a... My arm is unusually tight right now. Oh. Um, maybe just keep your coat on. A little hot here for that, don't you think? You're kind of making a scene. You know what? Um, why don't we just... call it? Excuse me? Listen. I don't mean to offend you in any way. You're clearly a very intelligent and beautiful woman. We both know this isn't going anywhere. Why don't we just be friends? Uh... Yeah. You know what? Uh, let's not and say that we did. Hey. You didn't happen to witness that Shakespearean tragedy, did you? I did. But she had a Lady Macbeth vibe. So, what can I get you? I think I'm just going to go. No. Come on. You're already here, all dressed up. Might as well eat something. You know what? You're right. Dealer's choice. Okay. But first... Oh, you... - That okay? - Yep. There you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. Our famous apple pie, and of course, a hot chocolate. Hmm. Good choice. Mind if I join you? Well, I appreciate the offer, but you don't have to... Oh, come on. Don't be such a downer. Try it. - Oh, man. - Mmm. You weren't kidding around. This is good. - It is good, right? - Wow. May I? Please. You know, I really should have known better to go on a blind date. Is that what it was? It was a blind date? - Mm-hmm. - I just went on one of those, and to call it disastrous would be an understatement. - Really? - Yeah. Do tell. Well... he didn't even pass the smell test. - Yikes. That bad? - Yeah, I know. Yeah. Well, I'm sure you have plenty of guys looking to take you out, so... Yeah. Not guys that I want. But let's not forget you are the one on the blind date tonight. Was on a blind date. She left. Remember? You kind of told her to beat it, didn't you? Yes, I did. - You did. - But I could read her mind. She did not want to hang out with me. You can read minds? What am I thinking? You're thinking... this guy better leave one heck of a tip after I rescued him out of his jacket. I did kind of rescue you tonight. Yeah, you did. I'm so sorry. - I have to get back to work. - Don't apologize. Duty calls. Enjoy that pie. Will do. - Hey. - Hey. Remember that guy I told you about who I met? Yes. He's here. What? No way. Where? Oh, boy. He's gone. But I am telling you there is definitely something there. Like a spark? Like a flame. This can't be happening. Why do you insist on kicking your ball against my wall? I have to practice for tryouts, or I'm not going to make the team. Look. This is your last warning. You kick your ball against my wall one more time and you're in deep trouble. Why do I have to listen to you? You're just a grumpy old Scrooge. You calling me old? Hey! Hey. I'm going to make sure you get nothing but coal this Christmas! You shouldn't yell at kids, man. It's not a good look. People around here talk, you know. You didn't see what he did. Are they really calling me Scrooge? Stop it. You can't be Scrooge. You're not rich like he was. You just need a little love to soften you up a bit. Speaking of that, how'd your date go with Hailey? Oh, don't tell me you blew it. How? I'd rather not talk about it. The right person for you is out there somewhere. We just might have to look harder. Or maybe I'm just destined to spend the rest of my life alone. I mean, it, man. Don't give up. Don't give up. Hello. Hi. Um, yeah. I was just wondering. Is Noelle working today? Diner patron: Oh, come on, cutie. Why won't you give up your number? I don't date customers. Don't you think I'm a rule worth breaking? Diner patron: What? You think you're too good for me? Come on. You work at a diner. Hey. You can't talk to like that. Says who? Says me. Mind your own business. We're having fun. Right, sweetie? No. We're not. Yeah. I'll mind my own business when you apologize to her. You think I won't swing on you because of your hand? Go ahead. Take a swing. But not before you tell everyone in here what you said to this woman. Your loss. Whatever. I'm out of here. You did not need to do that. Pretty sure I did. But what if he'd hit you? Would have gone down really hard, sprawled out on the floor, bleeding, moaning in pain. - Ooh. - If I was even still conscious. Anyway, it would've been a devastating scene. But you were willing to risk it all... to stand up for me? Well, the way I saw it, it was kind of a win-win. If he'd hit me, you would have felt bad for me, and possibly been willing to give me your number out of pity. Is that what you want? I've been kind of wanting to ask you since I met you. But I'm not trying to put any pressure on you. I do not want to act like that guy, so... You are nothing like that guy. Okay. I have to warn you. Now that I have this, I'm actually going to call you. You'd better. Don't be one of those guys that waits, like, three days. Three days? You kidding me? No. I'm more of a six-to-eight-months kind of guy. Well, I like to wait until the person has no idea who I am. Or you could just call me tonight. Yeah. I guess tonight would work. Yeah. Thank you. That last exit was so smooth, though, right? I know. It really was. Yeah. I thought I'd never be able to repeat that. Oh, it's okay. It's on me. - You sure? - Yeah. Of course. - Okay. - Okay. - I'm going. - Yeah. - For real. - Yeah. Cool. - See you. - Okay. - Bye, Jeremy. - See you in a while. A knight in shining armor. s e He really is. Mom, come look at this. What? Look at all these snowflakes. It's like a winter wonderland in here. I love it. No two snowflakes are alike, so we cut each one just a bit differently. I learned that in science class. Look at this one! Oh, wow. It's so unique and perfect. Just like you, Katie. Oh. - Oh. - What do we have here? I'm expecting a call. Do you mind if I take this? Take it. Hello? Noelle, hi. It's Jeremy. Uh, the guy from the diner. That guy you gave your number to. Oh, you're going to have to be more specific. I gave my number to a lot of guys today. Well, let me see. Um, I'm about six feet all, brown hair... Soulful eyes? So, you do remember me. Yeah. I do. Are you there? Yeah. Sorry. I must be nervous. Uh, I don't do this very often. Talk on the phone? Well, talk to women out of my league. Unless you count the woman that I speak to when I order takeout. Well, Jeremy, how about I make this easy on the both of us? What do you say we meet in person? Like a real date? Yeah. Like a date. Jeremy? - Are you there? - Present. Uh, I'm totally game. All right. Good. What do you want to do? Well... Skating? Bold choice. I'm a bold kind of guy. I can't believe you never been here. I know. I didn't even know it existed. It's so cool. Oop. You all right? Yeah. I see you've been doing this a really long time. Sort of. I grew up on a lake, so I spent a lot of winters skating. But oddly enough, after my stroke I actually found it easier. It's a different muscle group, apparently. You had a stroke? I'm so sorry. It turned my life upside down, but I try to keep reminding myself that I'm incredibly lucky. It, uh, could've been worse. Remembering that is hard to do sometimes. Yeah. You all right? Yeah. I'm just really cold. Can we go sit down somewhere, maybe? Oh, yeah. I know just the spot. That is so much better. Thank you. Yeah? Good. This is actually my favorite part of the river. They play beautiful music here. This is... Debussy's "Clair de Lune." So, you know your classics. Well, when it's your passion, you remember a few pieces. Don't you find classical music can sound a little... What? Boring sometimes? What? Boring? What? I mean, just... Oh, man. No. I mean, okay. Music like Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, and contemporary composers like Philip Glass, John Cage? I think it's some of the most beautiful music that's ever been created. It twists. It turns. It kind of takes you on an emotional ride. Well, when you say it like that, it makes me want to try it again. Hmm. Actually, I have an idea. Do you think it would be possible to, um, extend this date a little longer? I'm being too forward, aren't I? No, no, no. Um, I just... I feel like I need to be honest with you about something. Okay. I'm a divorced single mother. - You're divorced? - Yeah. - And you have a kid, or kids? - I have a son. Is that a problem? No, no. I'm actually divorced, too. You are? How long? A few years. What about you? Nine months. Oh. But I am over him, if that's what you're wondering. And look. If you want to call it a night, - I totally understand. - Noelle? I can't think of anything I'd rather do than spend more time with you. And there's also something that I really want to show you. So, come on. This way. I have goose bumps. I thought that might happen. That was so moving. Thank you. You know, when I was younger, I heard it said that music was the highest art form because it goes the furthest, the fastest, emotionally. That's, I think, what drew me to it. I take it you're a conductor. I was, but I still compose. I actually just had a meeting with the execs at the orchestra. They're considering a symphony I wrote. I'm just hoping they'll like it enough to consider it for next year's concert series. It's the piece that could re-establish me back into the music world. But, uh, we'll see. I should peel off here and go pick up my son. Oh. Of course. But, um, if your symphony does play next year, I'd love to go. Well, if it happens, then I'll, uh, I'll reserve the best seat in the house for you. Um, in the meantime, do you think I could maybe take you out to dinner? Kind of hate to think that our next date would be a year from now. I'd like that. Well, name a night, because I guarantee you I will be free. Just with Christmas and juggling my job and Christmas shopping... And my son is my number one priority. - I completely understand that. - Uh, but I do have the lunch shift tomorrow, and my son is going to his friend's house tomorrow night, so... mm... I guess I'm free. Is that too soon? Honestly... it's not soon enough. Ho, ho, ho! Help make sure - every child in Chicago... - Oh. Has a merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Here you go. - Santa thanks you! - Oh. - Ho, ho, ho. - Bye, Santa. What a lovely couple. Ho, ho, ho! My son would love that. Wait. I thought you had something against Christmas. Oh, when I'm with you, all I can think about is Noelle. Ooh. That's a good one. See you tomorrow. I can't wait. - Morning, Mom. - Morning, Henry. - Um, Mom? - Mm-hmm? We've got a problem. - What? - Edgar got out! He got out? Like, he got out of his cage? I might have not put the top back on when I was cleaning it, - but... - It's okay. Okay. - I don't know where he is! - We're going to find him. We're going to find him. It's fine. - Just... Let's search for him. - Okay. - Okay? - Edgar? Edgar? - Edgar? - Edgar, come back! - Come here, bunny! - Where are you? - Edgar, come here, bunny! - Edgar? - What are we going to do? - It's okay. - Um, just go look upstairs. - Okay. We're going to find him. It's fine. Edgar! Come here, you bunny! Okay. "Missing pet. Edgar the rabbit. If found, please notify Noelle and Henry at unit 202." I like it. Now, we just need the reward and we're done. Okay. What were you thinking? I don't know. Um... $1,000? Henry, we got Edgar for free. Okay. Well, we have to offer something. I have $23 saved. We could put that in. Okay. Yeah. That works, and I'll pitch in, too. We'll make it even, $50. Thanks, Mom! Don't worry. We're going to find him. How did you get in here? No! Stop! Hey, you little rodent. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Where you going? Don't. No. Oh, no, no. Don't you go under my... Ah, there you are. Alright. Come here. Come here. Ah! Come here, bunny. Bunny, come here. Oh. Got you. Outsmarted you, didn't I? Why am I taunting a rabbit? Luis? Yeah. Could I trouble you for a little bit of help? There's the culprit. Careful. He has a dangerous look in his eye. Maybe we should call the authorities. Might have rabies. Is this yours? No. - Careful, Luis. - Oh. There's no need for any of that. Why not? This isn't some rabbit off the street. This is Henry's pet. - Who's Henry? - The boy in 202. Does he have long brown hair? Yes. - About yea high? - Mm-hmm. I bet it's that delinquent that kicks his ball against my wall. Maybe he set the rabbit loose in here on purpose. Oh, I don't know about that. I mean... Oh, I do. There's another side to this kid. He's no angel. Trust me. Well, he's a good kid. Clearly, he has you fooled. What are you doing? I'm writing his parents a note. It's just he and his mom. They're very nice people. Yeah? Do very nice people let rabid rodents run loose in the neighborhood, Luis? Maybe you just scared him. I mean, you've been acting a little off lately. Oh, you haven't seen nothing yet. Okay. "Dear neighbor, I found your son's rabbit in my living room. God only knows how often this glorified sewer rat has relieved himself in my home, where I live, work, eat, and sleep. If this happens again, I will have no choice but to hand it over to wildlife authorities. Sincerely, 224." A little harsh, don't... Don't you think? I'll change "sewer rat" to "rodent." There. Now, when you return the rabbit, make sure they get the note. Got it, Mom. Edgar, you came back! Mom, Luis found Edgar! Well, actually, Mr. Geir in 224 found him in his home, and let's just say, he wasn't too happy about it. That guy is never happy about anything. He wants to set rabbit traps around the neighborhood. He wants to hurt Edgar? I knew he was mean! Well, maybe he just doesn't want bunnies - running wild in his home. - Okay. We'll make sure that he never gets out of the house. Right, Henry? - Right. - Hey, Edgar. You're safe now. Oh. Thanks so much for your help, Luis. Oh, one more thing, Noelle. He wanted me to give you this note. What is this? "Glorified rodent." "Report you to the wildlife authorities"? Okay. I do not have time for this man. He's really not a bad man. He's just been dealt a tough hand. Well, haven't we all? Some people have trouble seeing sunshine through the clouds. Thanks, Luis. Have a good day. Look, kid. I'm trying to be a better version of myself, but you are making it real hard. Why are you doing this to me? You tried to hurt my bunny! Don't you ever touch Edgar again! Well, if I find Edgar in my house again, I'll make sure you never see him again. Hey, give it back! - I don't think so. - It's mine! Correction. It was yours. Mom, he took my ball! Henry, take a breath. Okay. Come here. Tell me what happened. I was practicing for tryouts, like you said I could, when that Scrooge went and took my ball! Are you sure you weren't kicking the ball against his wall? No! He said he'd make sure I never see Edgar again! Who talks that way to a kid? You know what? Henry. I'm going to get your ball back. - You will? - Yes. His terror around this neighborhood is coming to an end. Thanks, Mom. What is wrong with that guy? Taylor. Oh, my gosh. Jeremy, I didn't even recognize you. - Hi. - Hi. - Who's this? - It's my son, Donovan the second, after my husband. Didn't realize, uh, you'd married again. It was a small ceremony. You know, just family. Of course. He sure is a good-looking little guy. - I'm happy for you. - Thank you. You look good. Here I was thinking I was looking awful, but then again, that's probably why you left me, right? Okay. Let's just be civil. Yeah. You're right. I'm really sorry. You know how I get at Christmastime. I'm just going to go. I'm sorry. - Jeremy. - I'm happy for you. I really am. Dear neighbor, Yesterday, my son was practicing for his soccer tryouts, and you took his ball. You had no right, as he was in the common area. I consider this theft, and I'm sure the police would agree. I expect you to return my son's ball immediately, along with a sincere apology for your continued crotchety behavior. Sincerely, 202. Alright, Scrooge. I'll get to you later. Henry, get down here! I've got to take you to Aunt Shannon's, or else we're going to be late! Coming! Two burgers, and holler if you need anything, okay? Greg, what are you doing here? I'm hoping to appeal to your better judgement. Okay. Um, I'll meet you outside. Okay. - I only have a minute. - I just wanted to tell you before you heard it from Henry. Dina and I are engaged. And you think by marrying her, that's going to erase our past? I'm not here to talk about the past. I'm here to talk about Christmas. We really think that Henry should be with us, you know, in an environment that's more like a normal family. To call you and your mistress hygienist a normal family and insinuate Henry being with his mother on Christmas is somehow inadequate... I find that appalling. - Noelle... - You know what, Greg? I am done with this conversation. Then you leave me no choice. You'll be hearing from my attorney. What the... Luis, ah, I'm glad you picked up. I have an emergency. Ah. I think I see the problem. What is it? There's something jammed in your lock. Can you get it out? - I'll have to find some... - Ah! I'll have to find some tweezers, see if I can remove it. This can't be happening. Luis, can you please hurry? I have a date in an hour. It's very, very important. I'll be back in a jiffy. Are you going out while I'm at my friend's? I am. Where? I'm going on a date. Is that okay? Yeah. Is this the same guy you went skating with? Yeah. His name is Jeremy. What's his last name? Maybe I can find him online. You know what? I don't know. And wait. You know how to do that? Yeah, obviously, Mom. Wait. You don't know his last name? No. I mean, I never thought to ask. You haven't even searched him! You don't know anything about him! Mom, he could be a serial killer! Henry, he is not a serial killer. How do you know? Jeremy is the type of guy that wouldn't even hurt a fly. - I promise you. - You sure? - Yes. - Okay. Just keep an eye out. No more murder podcasts at night. They're addictive. Any progress, Luis? It's a toothpick. I've almost got it. A toothpick? That's no accident. Bet you it was the kid from 202. Control the situation, Jeremy. Be a man, Jeremy! Fix the problem! I'm going to talk to the mother! Got it! So, do you like this guy? Yeah, I do. He's thoughtful, nice, - and he makes me laugh. - That's all good stuff, Mom, but it still doesn't prove that he's not a serial killer. - Henry, stop. - Sorry. You look really pretty. Thanks. What? It's just nice to see you smile again. Listen. I know things have been really hard, not having your dad around. I'm so sorry about that, but when life gets complicated, you lean on the people you love for support. That's why I'm so lucky to have you. And I'm lucky to have you, too. Ooh, Todd's mom. - Alright. Go upstairs. - Okay. Get your bag. No candy after 8:00! Okay! Coming! Jeremy. - Hi. - Hi. I... I thought I was meeting you at the restaurant. How did you know that I live here? Yeah. We... Wait. You live here? Yeah. How did you know that? I didn't. Uh... I'm actually here... Ah, Scrooge! Henry! I'm so sorry. Henry, this is the nice guy, Jeremy, the guy I'm going on a date with. I'm so sorry. No! That's the guy who stole my ball! I swear! - He's... - You... - You're his... - You're... - Well, you're... - Uh... - He's your... - You... - What? - What? I... I'm sorry. Are you the guy in 224? The one who chased my son, threatened him, and took his ball? Please tell me that that is not you. Your, uh, your kid... His name is Henry. Sorry. Henry... likes to kick his ball at my wall over and over. He released his rabbit into my place. He's been tormenting me while I've been trying to work. Henry, is that true? Don't lie, kid. It's Henry. Sorry. Henry, you're lying. - Am not! - Yes, you are. - I'm not! - Yes, you are. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, but what kind of adult steals a ball from a kid? He kicked the ball at my head! - No, I didn't! - Uh, yeah, you did, and it's a good thing I caught it, because it could have broke my nose. What was I supposed to do, give the ball back, say, "Here, kid, take another shot"? Henry, is that true? Were you kicking a ball at Jeremy's face? Well... not on purpose. It just got away from me. Got away from... Henry, go upstairs. I... I'm sorry to, um, ruin your perception that your kid is this perfect angel, but he is not. - No? - And worse, the reason that I came over here is because I found a toothpick in my lock. I can't even get in my place so that we can go on our date. Well, I think I know how to fix that. Ah, good. - How? - Yeah. By cancelling our date. Oh, and here's the note I was going to put on your door. I'm really sorry, Mom. Come here. You have nothing to be sorry for. But I ruined your date. Do you think that I would ever go out with anyone that didn't feel the same way about you as I do? Doesn't seem to bother Dad. What do you mean? Dina doesn't like me, but... he's marrying her anyway. What makes you think that she doesn't like you? I overheard her talking to Dad. She said that I keep making trouble. Dina doesn't know you the way that I do. Just give it time, okay? But sometimes, I do make trouble. Henry, all kids make trouble. The important thing is... is that we learn from our mistakes. But Mom, I... What's wrong? I... I got to go. Todd's here. Ah. Alright. Yes. "From your pals at Barnhart, Franklin, and Sham." Yeah. Worst divorce attorneys in the world, but at least your condolence gift is coming in handy. Ah, come on. There we go. Oh, yeah. I can't believe it. Jeremy is the Scrooge from 224. They're the same person? No. I just don't get it. He was been so nice and kind and funny, and he opened my eyes to new things. Plus, he was so cute! I did notice his beautiful eyes as he was slamming the door in our faces when we were caroling. Mm. Sorry. Do you want some? No, it's all you. I just don't think he's a bad person. Luis told me he's been going through a hard time since his wife left him after the stroke. Well, if that happened, that's terrible. But it still doesn't give him the right to be such a jerk to Henry. But maybe it's worth a conversation. No. I don't think so. I'm need to follow my own advice. I need to focus on my child and the holidays. That's it. Jeremy and I are done. Go away! Jeremy, are you okay? How... how did you get in here? The door was unlocked. Luis said that he heard yelling coming from in here last night. Yelling? The neighbors are talking. Sounds like you and Noelle made a bit of scene. Yeah. It, uh... didn't go well... at all. How about I make you some breakfast and, uh, you can tell me all about it? Yeah. Thanks. You know that kid that's been tormenting me? Yeah. It's her son. His name's Henry. Wait a minute. Is that who you were yelling at - the other day? - Uh-huh. - Oh, boy. - Yeah. I blew it, Frank. I had my chances with the greatest woman I have ever met. She's smart and funny, compassionate, beautiful. And her kid just pushed me over the edge. You know, part of meeting new people is being open to their worlds. It's not just about you. Yeah, but I wanted it to be about her. Yeah, well, she's all about him. You're right. I wish there was just a way I could fix this. Everyone makes mistakes. The strongest relationships I know are the ones where both parties are willing to forgive. Maybe you just need to start with an apology. Now, how do you like your eggs? However you're making them. Hey, Greg. It's me. Uh, Henry was telling me that he and Dina aren't really getting along, and, um, well, if she's going to be a part of his life, I want them to. So, what better way to start fresh than the holidays? Uh, so, how about we split Christmas? You can come get him after dinner. Let me know if that works. Okay. Bye. Henry, what are you doing here? Well, actually, Mr. Geir, I just... I really wanted to apologize. - Oh. - I shouldn't have kicked that ball at you, and I shouldn't have been practicing on your wall in the first place. It's just, things have been really frustrating since my parents have been fighting a lot. I'm sorry. That must be hard. Yeah. I promise I'll never do it again. Oh, yeah, and I'm sorry about putting that toothpick in your lock. I knew that was you. How'd you think of something so diabolical? It's actually genius. If it wasn't so wrong. I saw it online. Of course. I appreciate you coming over here and apologizing. It takes a lot of courage to admit when you're wrong. I'm sorry, too, for losing my temper. Remember this, Henry. No matter what life throws at you, always make sure you're proud of what's in here. Well, actually, Mr. Geir... Call me Jeremy. Okay. Well, Jeremy. I was just wondering if I could ask you a favor. Shoot. Would it be okay if you could ask my mom on another date? It's just, before I messed everything up, she was really happy. She's hardly ever happy anymore. The truth is, your mom deserves better. Oh. Okay. Well, I guess I'll see you around. Hey, Henry. - Thanks. - You bet. Wait, but I'll need someone to practice with. Want to kick it around? I'm pretty limited. Come on. Henry, your food's ready! Henry? Henry! Nice. Nice control. I want to be a striker. Funny. I used to be a striker. Oh. Mom! I finally have someone to practice with. - You do? - Yeah, Jeremy. He used to play in college. He's awesome. Yeah. It was fun. Let me know if you want to practice again. Okay. - Let's get inside. - Okay. Henry? Yeah, Mom? What made you go see Jeremy just now? I went to apologize. For? For the things I did. So he was telling the truth? But I'm really sorry and promise I'll never act like that again in my whole life. Well, I guess we all learned something from this, didn't we? Do you think I'm going to get coal in my stocking for Christmas? A kid with a heart as big as yours? Not a chance. I think you were right, Mom. This is going to be the best Christmas ever. Oh, come here, bud. I love you so much. Luis. Merry Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas Eve. - Oh, busy day? - Yeah. It always is around here. Anything I can do to help you out today? Actually, Luis, um... I want to thank you. You've done a lot for me, even if it wasn't not your job. Huh. I really appreciate that, Mr. Scrooge. Uh, Mr. Geir. I guess I was a bit of a curmudgeon, wasn't I? It's good to have you back. Actually, if you have the time, I do have a favor to ask. Jeremy. What are you doing here? Uh, there's something I want to say to you, and I wanted to say it in person. Okay. Your son, Henry, he's a really special kid. He, uh... He's inspired me to recognize and own up to some of my own faults. Well, you'll be happy to know that he had some owning up to do of his own. Well, I was the adult, and I couldn't see through my own pain to recognize that he was a kid who's... blowing off steam. Anyway, I just... I wanted to say that. You should be proud. Jeremy? What is it that you have against Christmas, anyway? What is it that you have against Christmas, anyway? Um... it was Christmas morning three years ago that I had my stroke. It was touch and go for a while. It was a miracle that I pulled through. The rehab was tough on both of us. I know I wasn't the easiest to be around while I was trying to come to terms with my new reality. Six months later, my... my wife was gone. And I've spent every Christmas since sitting alone, just thinking about that day that changed my life. I'm so sorry. Still, doesn't give me the right to be so grumpy when everyone else is just trying to enjoy it. Well, you'll be happy to know that, uh, Henry, he considers you a friend now, which is a Christmas miracle of sorts. I feel the same way. Tell him I say merry Christmas. Jeremy. Do you want to come over here tomorrow morning? - On Christmas? - Yeah. Henry's going to be opening his gifts before his dad picks him up, and I know that he would love it if you were there. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Good. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Can I open them? Not yet, bud. Why not? Later. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Jeremy. - Top one's for you, kid. Ooh! Alright. I'm glad you're here. Me, too. He likes it. Thanks for being here. You really made it special for the both of us. I'm the one who should be thanking you. I really think you're an angel. Why do you say that? Because you single-handedly restored my love of Christmas. Look. It's one of Santa's reindeers. It's Edgar the bunny rabbit reindeer. - Yeah. - He's going to give Rudolph a run for his money one day. Hey, um, we still got a little bit of time before your dad comes to pick you up, right? - Yeah. - Well, good, because I have one more Christmas present for both of you. Now, keep your eyes closed. Okay. - No peeking. - Okay. - We almost there? - We're almost there. Okay. And... open them. Whoa. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! Oh! - Hey. - Hi. Hi, cutie! I can't believe you did this. Well, Luis still had the tree in his garage, and we put it up last night. It's beautiful. Katie, why don't you start us off? ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ How lovely are thy branches ♪ ♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪ ♪ How lovely are thy branches ♪ I honestly can't think of a better gift. I can. This is so beautiful. You should be so proud of yourself. I'm more grateful than proud. But it's experiencing this with you and all the notes that once flew through my head that makes it that much better in person. Where are the guitars? - I thought this was a concert. - Henry, shh. So you like the string section, huh? How about I teach you a few chords when we get home? Yeah.
