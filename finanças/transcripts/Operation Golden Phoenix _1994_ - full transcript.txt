[dramatic music] [speaking in Arabic] >> I want to settle this thing right here and right now. >> Anytime you say Ivan. >> Okay, then let's do it. You ready? Go. >> After I finish defeating you, I'd like to double check all crates. Make sure it's all time locked properly. Professor Amid's one of my most respected clients. Everything has to be perfect. >> I know you've told me a million times. I triple checked everything. Now just be quiet, and give me a chance to win some of my money back. [telephone ringing] >> Hello, okay. Jones.>> Yeah. >> Hey!>> Man, I got a phone call. >> I'll see you on the plane. >> Hey, save yourself for the rematch. >> Oh, yeah. >> Yeah. >> You know, this is. How's it going? >> He doesn't suspect a thing. >> You're going to be a very rich man. >> That's the idea. Everything's going according to schedule. I'll see you in Toronto. [dramatic music] >> Ivan Jones.>> Yes. >> Of course, you already know Malik. >> I was just coming to see you. >> I guess that means you have the money you owe me. >> I'm getting it. >> I want the money now. Three thousand U.S. >> Look, Youssef, If I'm on my way to Canada to deliver some very valuable museum pieces and when I return, I'll pay you everything I owe you, deal? >> Malik.>> Okay, okay. Let me give you what I have. >> What's this, a pen? >> Oh, it's not just a pen. It's a weapon. >> Yaah! >> Aah! >> Keep the pen. [dramatic music] >> Good evening Vechio. >> Good evening, sir. >> The Byblos treasure. Are we fully prepared for its arrival? >> Well, our security's at full alert. Who's bringing it in from Lebanon? >> Mark Assante is personally escorting the treasure. >> Assante! Who the hell hired him? >> Professor Amid, he believes he's the man for the job. >> Yeah! Well, I don't trust the son of a bitch. >> Assante's reputation is flawless. >> He never follows a confirmed procedure. I just don't feel safe when he's involved. >> You worry too much. >> Yeah, we'll see about that. >> Welcome to Toronto, Canada. We'll be landing shortly at Pearson international airport. [dramatic music] >> Those 17 hour flights are killing me. >> Welcome to cool Canada. >> It's good to be home. >> Almost home. You know Anne called she's asking about your again. >> Great. I'll see her in person. How's the time? >> Got, two minutes to check point one. >> Good. We're right on schedule. Who's tracing us? >> Vechio. >> Golden Phoenix to base. How are you Vechio? >> I'm starting to get a headache knowing you're back in town. >> Well, maybe you'll stay awake. >> Listen Assante, you've got exactly eleven minutes to get here? If you're more than one second late, I'll make sure everyone knows about this. >> Is that a wager? >> How does 500 bucks sound to you? >> Five hundred bucks. All right, man, make it a thousand. >> Deal!>> Great. [dramatic music] [tires screeching] What the hell is this? [dramatic music] Ram it! [guns firing] >> Security trucks one and two hold back. Maintain your positions, wait for my instruction. >> Mr. Jones there's two guys coming at us with guns. Stay calm. Everything's under control. >> Put your hand up. [gun firing] >> Don't shoot.[gun firing] [dramatic music] >> Are you crazy? Don't leave the van stay in here, it's safer. >> The best defense is a good offense. [shotgun firing][gun firing] >> Aah! >> Aah! >> Our men are being slaughtered, send help, now. [shotgun firing][gun firing] >> Go to plan B. Repeat. Plan B. >> Let's get him cover on the other side. [shotgun firing] >> Aah! [dramatic music] [shotgun firing]>> Aah! [sirens wailing] >> Great. It's about time. >> Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon. Kick it over here.>> Special service. >> Kick it over. He moves, kill him. >> No. Don't shoot.[gun firing] >> Place the bombs and set the timer. Hurry up, hurry up. >> Let's move these bodies. Get the van, let's get the hell out of here. [clock ticking] [car doors slamming shut] [sirens wailing] >> Morning Chief. >> Sergeant, look after these for me will you.>> Thank you. Give her a hand. >> Chief Gordon, this is... >> Save the introduction. Assante and I know each other. In spite of that, we're still going to try and be fair because that's kind of guy I am. Now Assante. You claim that the police did this, uh. They killed Ivan Jones and then they stole the treasure. And I have made a thorough examination of this case, and come to only one conclusion. Your statement just doesn't add up. You know, and I know that it was just a matter of time until greed. Uh, just simply greed. Being trusted to guard millions of dollars worth of artifacts was just too much for you to handle. The police did it, huh. Frankly, Assante I would have expected a better story than that from you. But better story or not, the bottom line is the only way to rob this shipment is from the inside. And there were only two people on the inside who could have gotten to the treasure before the alarms went screaming all over hell's half acre. Only two people who had the password. Only two people, you and Ivan Jones. Except he's not here anymore is he? Prematurely cremated by the truck explosion. Dead, gone, nothing left to him except his I.D. Only you were left alive and only your fingerprints are on the computer keyboard. You did it Assante. There is no way that anybody else could have done this. Now I want to know now. The names of your accomplices. >> Listen, smart guy.>> Hey, don't you call me smart guy? Who do you think you're talking to? >> I did not do it. And if I did, it's gonna take somebody a lot smarter than you to figure it out. >> I'm not here to play games asshole. I want some straight answers right now. I swear to you, I'm personally going to guarantee that your life's going to be one miserable living hell starting right now. >> I'm not saying another word until I talk to my lawyer. >> Get him the hell out of here before I really lose my temper. >> Got the spec sheet on your background. Interesting read. Your reputation shows that you're a very dangerous person. >> Where's my lawyer? >> I understand Mr. Margolese is your usual attorney, but he's on vacation. He's appointed me to look after your case. This way, now he'll probably be able to make it back for the trial. [blowing loudly] [dramatic music] Tomorrow we'll attend a bail hearing. Now, I've reviewed the case. Frankly, this is pretty straightforward and we can plea bargain. And with a little luck, you'll get 20 to 40. Depends on what sticks, you might be able to get out in about 15. Now all you need to do is to give them a little something to go on. You know, name a few accomplices. Okay just give him one. >> I'm innocent. >> What you do mean, what? >> I am innocent. >> Huh! [blowing loudly] I'm sorry, I uh, I don't quite understand. >> I'm innocent. I didn't kill my partner, I didn't steal the treasure, you stupid idiot. >> Back to the cell. >> You guys really want to put him in here? >> Chief Gordon's orders. >> Okay, guys, back up, get back. [prisoners talking] Get in there. >> Got the key.>> Thanks. Let's do the paperwork. >> Look what we have here, a nice suit. Give me a smoke, where's the smoke? Is it in here? >> I don't smoke. >> You fuck. You won't last long in here. >> Very cosy isn't it. >> Asshole! >> Assante put your hands through there. Time to see the lady. >> All rise! You maybe seated. >> Mr. Assante, due to the seriousness of the crime request for bail, will be denied, a trial date will be set later. In the meantime, you will remain in full custody. [gavel banging loudly] >> Come on, keep it moving. >> Look, it's the suit. >> Still looking for a smoke? >> Fuck you. >> Escaped convict, he's getting away. >> He's got my keys. [dramatic music] >> Mark Assante, has escaped custody and is now at large in the station. Secure all exits and be prepared. He's very dangerous, if necessary shoot-to-kill. [birds chirping] [car horn honking] >> He's going for the street. Come on, let's move. [dramatic music] >> Ivan Jones, [laughing] you did it. Congratulations are in order. It wasn't too difficult, was it? >> Same thing I used to do for the government, only it's much sweeter doing it for myself. >> And you see Mark Assante taking the rap. Don't worry, it's clean as a newborn baby. Operation Canada fini. Operation Lebanon, commence. Now we go to Lebanon to pick up the second pendant. >> What, you never told me anything about a second pendant. >> Oh, didn't I? Well, it's like a CD Rom game. Advance and find out. >> I'm not in the mood for your games, Chang. >> The second pendant leads us to the lost treasure. >> Who's got it? >> It's owned by Princess Angelica. She's an Amir descendant. There are a few left in that part of the world. >> What sort of support do we have in Lebanon? >> I have a home and business in Lebanon. Professor Amid's wife is my confidante. >> Professor Amid's wife. [laughing] >> A sweet, two timing whore. [telephone ringing]>> You devil! >> There are some of us left too. Hello. What? Are you sure? Because you didn't want to kill him, you sentimental fool. Your buddy has escaped jail. Assante escaped how? >> You let him live, that's how. I want him dead. Do you understand, dead. >> Okay. >> Hire those phony cops to kill him. Here's the cash. And when you're done join me in Lebanon. I don't want that son of a bitch tailing me, understand. And if you fail this time. >> Relax, Chang, relax. I know Mark Assante better than he knows himself. I know exactly where he'll go. He's got a little girlfriend, works in a theater and I'll get him. >> Do that. [dramatic music] >> Cops! >> His girlfriend knows nothing. Where to now? >> Let's radio in. [laughing] >> I hated the play the actor's a ham. >> Ah, you just don't like Shakespeare. >> The only consistent thing in life is life's chronic inconsistency. Life. Life's but a poor player who frets and struts his hour upon the stage. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. I have almost forgot the taste of fears. The time has been. >> Police are still looking for Mark Assante, who escaped police custody earlier. [radio playing] [door shutting] >> I loved the play. >> Mark, oh my God. Are you all right? >> Sure, just fine. >> I've been following your case. The police were here. >> I didn't.>> I know you didn't do it. I have known you for years. People are going to recognize you, you can't stay here. >> Disguise me. >> What? >> Hey change my appearance I have to leave town. I need it to go to Lebanon. >> If this which he avouches does appear, there is nor flying, hence no tarrying here, I begin to be aweary of the sun, and wish the estate o' the world were now undone. Ring the alarm bell! Blow, wind, come wrack! At least we'll die with harness on our back. [applause] [knocking on door] >> Final curtain, 30 seconds left. >> It's not safe here. Take my keys, I've got a car parked out back, I'll pack the make up, and go to my apartment. >> Here you go, boys. >> Using blanks was a good idea. It was a pleasure killing you. And remember, me and my associates are always available if anything else comes up. I hope you and the Byblos treasures are very happy together. >> One thing I hate about this job. >> What's that Mr. Jones? >> Tying up the loose ends can be a real pain in the ass. [gun firing] [dog barking] >> You're looking for someone. >> Aah! [gun firing] [dramatic music] [gun firing] [gun firing] >> Who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you? >> To hell with you, man. I'm not telling you nothing. [gun firing]>> Aah! [tires screeching][gun firing] >> Let's go to the club.>> Yeah! >> You're fine? >> Of course I'm fine. Why? >> Never mind. [melodious music] I guess I need a new identity now. Do you know, Johnny? >> Johnny, he's the Greek right, yeah, I've heard of him. >> On the Danforth. He used to make forged documents, for the Greek underground in World War II. Nazis never recognized his signatures. He's got a steady hand and a jewel cutter's eyes. He's a bit older now, but he can still work his magic. >> And how much is this going to cost me? >> Just tell him I sent you, he'll take care of it for me. >> Anne. >> Look, it's the least that I can do. If you ever get out of hot water you son of a bitch, you better plan on spending some real time with me. >> I promise. [melodious music] [dramatic music] [knocking on door] >> Your Johnny the Greek? >> Get lost! >> Anne from the theatre sent me. >> Okay, come on in. Who, you're kidding with that. You can fool some people, but you can't fool me. I got eyes like nobody else. >> I need a passport. >> You brought the cash, I figure. >> Anne will take care of it. >> That figures. You're in luck. I've got a name, Balcour Bernard Balcour. You brought a picture. >> Yeah. >> Aha! You the fellow I saw in the papers? >> Yeah. >> Aha! Good thing to get out of town if I were you. [dramatic music] [middle eastern music] >> Welcome to Lebanon, Mr. Chang.>> Umm! Aah, good to be back. >> Good to have you back. Everything is proceeding smoothly. >> Ivan Jones' flight is expected to arrive shortly. [middle eastern music] >> Aah! >> Mr. Chang, Alana, welcome. >> Ah, so pretty, very kind. >> Light, Mr Chang. [middle eastern music] [jet engine roaring] [airport announcer] [dramatic music] [jet engine roaring] >> Taxi! >> I'm waiting for someone. >> Who? >> Hey, Walter. >> Good to see you, my friend. >> I'm happy to be here. >> Are you sure? Coming back to Lebanon was a smart thing to do. >> I have to see, Professor Amid. >> Are you crazy? He's the last person you need to see. >> I don't have a choice. I need some kind of a meeting. [beautiful acoustic guitar] >> He's at the Montalaban car rally and after 3, I'm one of the drivers. >> You and the Professor have become good friends, I take it. >> Well he should like me. I'm engaged to his daughter, Nicole. This treasure incident has made a lot of news and your presence here, could really stir things up, if you know what I mean. >> The stolen statues and the pendant are very recognizable. Whoever took them, will be unable to sell them. Therefore, the thieves must have had some other use for them. [car horn honking] I'll need somewhere to stay. >> Don't worry. You can hide at my place. >> Where are we going right now? >> My fiancé is at the marina. >> What time are we getting to the race? >> It starts in 10 minutes. >> Do we have enough time? >> It's faster by boat. [beautiful acoustic guitar] [beautiful acoustic guitar] >> Get in. Nicole, start the engine. >> Hi Nicole.>> Welcome back Mark. >> Come on, hurry up, Walter. Let's get to the race. [engine starting] [dramatic music] [crowd chattering] >> Call me later. Let's get ready. >> Daddy. >> Hello, my sweetheart. >> I missed you. >> I've missed you, too. >> Hey, Walter, I'll see you on the boat. Ciao! [car engine revving] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] >> Assante. What the hell are you doing here? >> I have to talk to you. >> You stole my Phoenix pendant. I did not steal it, that's why I'm here. I'm trying to find out who did it. >> The police are looking for you. It's very courageous of you, coming here. Either that or you're stupid. What do you want from me? >> Only you can help me. >> Why, are you demanding ransom for the pendant? >> No. You've got to believe me. The police are not the only ones after me. I need your help. >> Mr. Chang, it's Sue the Professor's wife. She says it is important. >> Hello. >> Hi, honey. I'll see you tonight. Everything is all set up for you. >> It better be, I'm expecting the best from you, darling. Ahh, Ivan Jones, has arrived. Let's go out and party. [loud upbeat music] >> Oh, hello my dear. >> Hello. >> This is Mark Assante. He's visiting us from Canada. This is my wife, Sue. >> It's a pleasure. >> What a coincidence. How is that? >> Those people are asking about you. >> Who are they?>> They left their card. They asked if I heard or saw anything of you to give them a call. >> Great insurance people. >> Better make more sense there. Meet up with me later. >> Thanks. >> Is everything okay? [middle eastern music] >> Mark is still alive. >> Who, Assante? >> Yes. He was at the car rally today. >> Ivan. Why didn't you kill him? >> Kill who? >> Assante, you fool, who else? He was seen at the car rally today. >> I, I couldn't shoot him in the back. >> Bullshit! Assante could have ruined everything. When I give you an order, you follow it to a tee, you understand? >> I'll go kill him right now. >> No, it's too late. I'll think of another time. >> Chang the pendant. Does he know about the pendant? >> He knows nothing. What about Angelica's pendant? It looks very much like the one that we have. >> Legend has it that there are two pendants like this when put together they reveal a map that leads to lost treasure of the Ottoman Empire. Ivan, there's a change of plans. We're gonna use Assante to our advantage. >> I know exactly what you're thinking. >> We'll, let Mark Assante infiltrate the castle steal the pendant and then we'll kill him. [soft music] [hawk screaming] >> So tell me Assante, what is your next step? >> I need answers to my questions first. >> Make yourself comfortable, while, I make some coffee. >> Thanks, my dear. >> Our security was state of the art. I understood only five people knew about it. And they're all accounted for, including my dead partner. Who else knew about it? >> Assante, you put on a good show. >> I didn't realize we had a guest. I have news for you.>> Oh! >> Princess Angelica will be soon wearing the pendant. >> Now, that proves he's innocent. >> Hardly. He could still be in on it with her. >> Don't let me interrupt your work. >> What does it take to prove my innocence? >> It is very simple. The princess has my pendant, and I want you to get it back for me. >> Thank you, thank you. It's good to be home. [applause] Let the festivities begin. [middle eastern music] >> Hi Walter. I'm about to do something really stupid. I hope it works. [seatbelt clicking] [tires screeching] >> Hey, what was that? >> Hey mister, are you okay? >> Ohh! >> Lets bring him inside. >> I'm sorry, I'm sorry. >> Don't move this, gently, gently. [middle eastern music] >> He needs help. >> Quiet! Explain to me. >> Who are you? >> I'm Angelica and this is my family. I hope for your sake, you were not intending to bring misfortune to our people. >> I'm not. I just need my car fixed. >> Come up here. Let me see your hands. >> Why?>> Hands never lie. They reveal what's in your heart. You can count on our hospitality. >> Thank you. >> Walk with me. >> Find out who he is. [middle eastern music] [clapping and singing] >> You're not from around here. >> No I live in Canada now. Your accent. You must have spent some time in the west. >> Harvard. Bachelor of Science.>> Wow! >> But I came back to my people when my father died. [clapping and singing] >> Why would you want to remain here? >> It's in my blood? Maybe you understand it full time you need to know where you come from. It's hard to understand the ways of our people. In the morning, I'll have someone help you with your car. >> Thank you. [soft music] [dog barking] [dog barking] [phone ringing] >> Hello. >> Yeah, Hi. Sue, is Professor Amid there? >> He's busy right now. >> Tell him I've got the pendant, meet me at the dam. I feel very badly about this. >> I'll give him the message, Mark. [chanting morning prayers] >> Zana! Zana! My pendants gone. >> The stranger's not in his room. >> Get him and my pendant back now. He's probably on foot send Chaouki with the horsemen after him. [chanting morning prayers] [horse neighing] [dramatic music] >> Allah! >> Sue, I thought you said the Professor was meeting us here. >> He's busy. He asked me to come instead. Do you have the pendant? Thank you very much. You've stolen the second pendant >> Second pendant. >> The two pendants lead to the lost Ottoman treasure. >> Who are you working for? >> You won't live long enough to find out. >> Hands up, go over there, move, move. [telephone ringing] >> Hello. >> Hi, partner.>> Susan. >> I have the second pendant. >> Excellent. And what did you do with Assante? >> He's being taken care of as we speak. [dramatic music] >> Aah! >> I want you to bring the pendant directly to me. >> I'm on my way now. Remember, you promised to take care of me. >> Hey, darling, don't worry. Have I ever failed you? >> No, no, not you my sweet. I trust you implicitly. [water roaring] [dramatic music] >> Have you heard any news? >> Zana is on her way to see you. >> Your Highness, the stranger has returned to the castle. >> I can explain. >> You have dishonored us. Sit down. Where's the pendant? >> It was taken from me. >> Who has it and why? >> I know where to find it, but I'll need some help. That's why I came back here. >> Really? There are two pendants. If they're put together, they form a map to a hidden treasure. >> I've never heard this. >> I just found out myself. >> Liar. >> I'm telling the truth. >> Why should I give you a second chance? >> We have to work together if you want to recover your pendant. Otherwise you'll never see it again. >> You're lucky, I believe you. Keep an eye on him. Tara, this is Mark Assante. >> I assume he's the reason you called for me. >> Mr. Assante is the person who snuck into my room and stole the pendant. Now he's come asking for our help to recover it. >> Who's this person? >> This person is my sister. >> That pendant's been in our family for 16 generations. I suspected you were trouble. >> I've already apologized. If I can't get any assistance from either of you, I'll find the damn thing by myself. All I wanted was a couple of men to help me. >> No, you will not take any of our men. >> Well, then, it's settled. Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll mail you the pendant once I find it. >> I'm going with you. >> You?>> That's right. I don't trust you, Mr. Assante. And I'm certainly not going to let you out of my sight. >> We have to go to Professor Amid's house first. Let's go. >> I still can't figure it out. >> You asked for two pendants, we got you two pendants. Now, what's your problem? >> Combining these two pendants together, I'm supposed to get a clue to the location of the lost treasure of the Ottoman Empire. >> What exactly is the lost treasure? >> Think of a mountain, a mountain of solid gold coins. You would be so rich, you wouldn't know what to do with them all. >> That's just great. Except you can't figure out the puzzle. Listen Chang, I've been really patient with you up till now. I'm the one who's taken all the risks. You better figure it out and figure it out now. >> Get out of my face, huh? Without me, you'd still be doing shit for Assante. So don't start telling me what to do. Go get Professor Amid. He's the only one that can interpret the information on these pendants. Bring him to my warehouse. >> No problem. [laughing] >> How cute. >> Oh, my God.>> Who the hell are you? >> Where's your daddy, the Professor? >> Hey, don't move, or I'll blow the fucking girl away. Akhmed cuff 'em. You'll have to do until we find your daddy. Come on, little girl, you're coming with me. >> Get your hands off me. >> Get your hands off of me you asshole.>> Let go. Let go. [dramatic music] >> Come on out of the car. >> Get off of me. Get off of me.>> Out of the car. >> Get off of me.[girl screaming] >> You bastard, let go. >> What's the matter with you people? Where you taking me? >> Let go. >> Up those stairs, come on, move it. Come on. >> Let go. >> Get in. The Professor wasn't at his home. But I understand he is at the excavation site in Byblos. I'll get him now. Sue this shouldn't take long. [men speaking in Arabic] Professor Amid. >> What? >> You're coming with me. >> What are you doing? Take your hands off me. [dramatic music] >> Aah! [dramatic music] >> It's about time. >> Take your hand off me. >> Come on Amid, out. Let's go, come on. >> Where are you taking me? >> Professor, you're about to meet an old friend. >> Oh, my God. >> Professor. Good afternoon. >> You've always wanted what I have. >> Please sit here. >> I should have known it was you. >> The trouble with people like you is, you're too naive. With all your intelligence, knowledge of the history treaties of the world. You still trust people. You let your wife know about the pendants and the inscriptions on them. And Ivan he knew about your departure dates, arrival times, it didn't take me long to find Ivan and win him. Greed is a universal trait. And Ivan has his share of it. >> What do you want from me? >> Good question. You see, you know, the inscriptions on those pendants now transcribed them. >> No! No! I said, No! >> Then we have a surprise for you. >> Come on little girl, let's show your dad. >> No, let go, no. >> No, no, not Nicole. >> Do you like it? >> Okay, Okay. >> That's very noble of you, transcribe, I said, now. >> Check all the rooms. Professor Amid. Sue, anybody. >> The place is empty. >> Nobody. >> Where's my pendant? Don't even think about lying to me again. >> I don't know where it is, Sue the woman who took it from me, lives here. >> That's good professor, very good. >> I want to get into my home file. >> All right. [phone ringing] >> Kill him now. >> Wait, wait, the computer. Hey, take a look at this. Somebody's accessing the Professor's computer. It's him. This is his own password. [dramatic music] >> Can I have a drink of water? >> You want water? >> Aah!>> Here's some water, bitch. >> Sue, quite the loving stepmother, ah? >> I've got it. >> Excellent. You are a genius, Professor. >> You will need to keep me alive if you want the treasure. You won't be able to translate the secret codes. >> Maybe I can and maybe I can't. And I can Professor. [gun firing] Poor Professor. He just didn't know what this information was worth. [computer beeping] Looks like we're going to Baalbek. >> Chaouki, call the police. We're off to Baalbek. [dramatic music] >> D2 is the coordinates. Right there. [dramatic music] Come on. According to this clue, you need to make it over to the Jupiter Temple. These are the correct inscriptions. [dramatic music] Ramsey, you stay here and make sure we're not followed. >> Yes, sir. [dramatic music] >> Yes, there should be an entrance around here. There, I think the entrance must be on the other side. > I wonder if Chaouki made it. There.>> I sent him around the other way. >> According to this, it leads this way. [dramatic music] It's got to be somewhere. Look, over there. >> Yeah. [dramatic music] >> We should be getting closer. There's the Jupiter columns. >> Come on, there are the columns. [dramatic music] >> There, Bacchus Temple. [dramatic music] We're nearly there. [dramatic music] According to the map the treasure should be directly below us. At noon, a shaft of light will mark the spot. >> Which way? >> Let's split up. I'll go this way. >> Careful. >> Down. >> Almost there, you can smell it. Watch your step. Stairs are slippery. That's it, down there. Sue get the light over here and stay close to me. [dramatic music] >> We'll be rich. >> Yes. Yes. >> Maybe we'll have 100 million dollars. >> Yes, yes, one hundred, two hundred, maybe three hundred, who knows. Come on. >> Aah! [Sue screaming] [dramatic music] >> Sue. >> More treasure for us. >> Man isn't this something. >> Light 'em. >> Shit, look how dry it is, huh. Take a look around, will ya. >> Wow. >> They must have killed the slaves to hide the secret of the treasure. >> Spare me the history lesson, Chang. >> You're getting kind of bold, aren't you! Start looking around? >> Chang, Chang, look where the light strikes. >> Bring the light over here. Let's see. No, it's the same inscription as on the pendant. Half of the writing on this pendant. >> Look, look. >> Yeah, the other half on a different pendant. This is it. [laughing] >> Ha, ha, ha, whoo! >> Ah-ha! [dramatic music] >> I can smell the goddamn treasure. >> It's not here. [dramatic music] >> Yes, that's it. >> Whoo-ho, yeah. >> Get that side. >> There's nothing in here. [dramatic music] >> This is it, where's the million? >> I don't know. After all that work. It's like this just enough for one buddy. Step back. So long baby. [dramatic music] >> Arrgh! [rumbling] >> Ivan, you should be dead. >> No, you should be dead. I spared your life. [rumbling] [laughing maniacally] >> I'm rich, I'm rich. [loud thud] [rumbling] [loud thud] [rumbling] [rumbling] [gun firing] >> Aah! [dramatic music] >> You set me up, why? >> I let you live. I won't make that mistake again. >> You're coming with me. >> No. [crying] >> Son of a bitch, you're a dead man. >> Ivan. >> Shoot me! Ivan, don't make me! >> Shoot me! Ivan. You know, I can't do it, but I'm not letting you walk away without a fight. >> Yeah. Let's get it on. Come on. >> You want to make it personal, eh? >> I can feel it, Mark. I can feel the energy.
