That struggle inside you. Do you feel it slipping away? No doubts, pure thoughts. Pure urges. Feel her skin. Feel her soulless shell beneath you. They're all slaves to a dying world. But not you. Desire is the one true emotion. Just turn around against the truck! Hmm? Hmm? Lindsay. We can't do this forever. We've made it this far. Do you want them to live? I want them to suffer. We're all suffering, Spence. What you got there? You're out of your fucking mind. That's why I don't trust you. Something on your mind? Doesn't matter anymore. You say that to my wife? I don't remember. You should just kill us. Can't do that. Don't want this to end. You stole my wife's purity and turned her against me. Hurting you is all I have. Ah! I told you I don't remember. Please! Ah! Fuck. Please, man, I don't remember. I told you about my sister. She told me she was raped when we were little. Ah! Why do you tell me these stories? I don't remember. It was Gatling. I don't... I don't remember anything. I want you to suffer, Riley. Even if it doesn't make sense to you, it's what's right. Stop it. I'd rather hear your screams than remember my son's voice. Please, please. Every time you beg, it reminds me of what you denied her. Fuck! Stop pretending, Riley. Remember, this was your choice, not mine. I didn't know. Spence. I didn't know. I didn't know. How can you keep doing this? If you got the man that raped your sister, wouldn't you? Ah! If you have anything to say now's your chance. I'm more interested in what you have to say. What I'm doing is right. You two need to be punished. Do you enjoy causing us pain? Are you a sadomasochist? We both know the meaning of this fire. It marks my expiry date. Spence, help me understand. In two minutes, you won't need to know. I would be delighted to take it to the grave with me. My old man told me the world isn't for the weak. It was strange how he'd practiced this train of thought on my mother and me. I swore I would never let him hurt my mother again. And I stood up to him. And he beat me so bad, he couldn't even look at me. Stuck me out in the barn for a week so I'd know my place. Told me my own mother wasn't for me to protect. Finally, when I found my way out, I came home, and... I found her hanging from the kitchen ceiling fan. I wanted my family to be better than the family I came from. You have no idea what you've done here. One time I tried to help people with their pain. Then I found my calling. I learned how to examine and exploit their misfortunes. I wish I'd found you, Spence. You did. I wish you could see what you destroyed. I'd wish you'd realized what you've gained. I'm going to see Jacob. Promise me you'll never leave? You two are my family. Where would I go? Please forgive me. Our baby's down there. There's a man locked in our basement. There has to be a reason. I need to do this. Can you even kill him? What would you do if I gave you the gun? Could you kill him? Yes. I'm punishing him, Lindsay. Why? Jacob's gone. You're gone. What? Sleeping out in the barn always makes me sick. You have to get out of here. I don't want you to go down there tonight. Spence? This isn't bringing him back. Why would you say that? - I... I... didn't. - Why did you say that? I'm not going to ask you again. I just want this to be over. But you would use Jacob? Spence, I would never... What? I still love you. Spence, do you still love me? I'm trying to understand. They took something away from us that you can never get back. You think I don't know this? You think you're the only one suffering? I should put you out. I should know better. It's over. I have something to tell you. It's your baby. You said you got rid of this. I did. You said you burned it. Hey! What's happening? What's happening? You brought me to hell! - This is really going to hurt. - No! Get dressed. Is he...? I figured you'd want to look him in the eyes before he dies. Put the hood back on. You don't want to look at him? Spence, this is in-human. What this monster did was in-human. I'm not... I'm not a monster. Ask him about the attack. How could you have done that? I wouldn't do it. I don't remember anything. Gatling did something. I swear. I don't remember anything. My sister was raped when I was a child. Spence... let's kill him. You don't have to. Tell me the truth. Tell me you remember. Tell me you killed him! It's okay. I'll do it. The hell you will! What are you doing? Getting the fuck away from you! I thought you wanted him dead. I want this to be over! Gun's not loaded, Lindsay. You couldn't shoot the man who raped you, but you'd shoot your own husband? I could put one in your leg and send an ambulance with the cops. Lindsay. Don't leave me. Lindsay, don't leave me. You're not right, Spence. You need help. I was going to stop. I'm sorry... but I don't believe you. Lindsay. Lindsay! Lindsay! Lindsay! Oh, the truck keys! You said... you said you sister was... Yeah. She was attacked. When you came here what do you remember? I remember being naked in the dark. Cold, wet basement. I remember pain. I didn't know what I did until Spence screamed it in my face. What do you remember from before? Gatling... laughing. And then he gave me something. I don't remember anything else. Why were you with him? I've been alone a long time. I didn't think it could get any worse until... I woke up chained to a wall. You raped me, Riley. That's what people keep telling me. I woke up a rapist. I woke up a murderer. I've been living in a nightmare since that night. I screamed at you. I'm so sorry, Lindsay. Why didn't you listen to me? I'm so sorry. Why haven't you killed yourself? I've tried. Spence won't let me. Do you think you're ever getting out of here? I don't want out. Maybe... maybe I think you've suffered enough. You want me to die? No. Otherwise, you'd already be dead. Well, what then? I just want to get out of this place. I could help you. Where did you grow up? I want to know about you. Lived on the streets. Homeless people used to use me to get food. Seems like people are always willing to give more generously to a poor kid than a poor man. Why didn't you kill me when you had the chance? I don't want to hurt anyone. You've suffered enough. It would have made Spence happy. You two could have left this place. I don't know about that. He's not the man that I married. And if this ends, I don't know what he's going to do. What's worse, the pain or the waiting for it? Ah, flesh is flesh, pain is pain. The only true suffering is in the mind. Spence knows what he's doing. My mind keeps going back to that night. And no matter how many times I try to change the scenario, my obsession demands obedience in playing the slave. Why do you talk like that? It's been a long time since anybody listened. For what it's worth, I'm sorry. Things aren't turning out the way that they should. I've been trying to end this thing. But I realize that there's still... some things that I need to do. After that, things will get back to the way that they were. Before all this? Don't push it. You'll be better. Do you understand? Hey! Do you understand? I know a way to get out of here. At least I know, how to get my chain off. Why don't you just escape? I have to be in the barn. Spence has a habit of checking up on me. You could just... just take a chance and run for it. Do you not remember coming out here? I don't even know what state we're in. We're forty miles to the nearest town. There aren't any neighbors. Spence knew what he was doing when he moved us back here. Back here? This is the house Spence grew up in. What do you see in the basement? There's nothing. He cleaned it all up. I need you to look around. Is there anything you can do? I don't... I've never been out of here. I would have thought of something. If I can slip out of the barn, I can get to the basement. I know where he keeps the keys. They're under the stairs that's where he keeps them. Under the stairs. Are the truck keys in there? I don't know but he keeps keys in there. I have a plan. I don't suppose it involves me. Not right away. If I escape, I could send help back. Believe me? It's just I may not be around long enough to appreciate it. You think I should risk helping you? No. He's here. So, what happens now? I've made sure we can make it through the winter and much of the spring. Why can't we be civil? I don't want to hurt you, Lindsay. Please, stop now. Did they stop when I begged them? Do you stop when I beg you? All this will be forgiven if you just stop. I have a request to make, Spence. You chain me down in the basement with him. Why? Well I wouldn't want you to get your wife confused with me. And at least, down in the basement, I would have someone to talk to. To be with. You selfish fucking whore. You like that, Spence? You need it. You need all the control. Do it, Spence. Treat me like they treated me. Like how your mother was treated. You're no different than them. You're no different than your dad. Spence. What's going to happen in the winter? You just going to leave me out here to freeze because that sounds really good right now. You'll be taking Riley's place in the basement. You're such a pathetic, sad excuse for a man. We're all laughing, Spence. Everybody's laughing. Is that what you like to do to your wife? I can't do this anymore. I can't. She deserves better. I don't know how to make it right. Lindsay! Lindsay! Lindsay! Lindsay! I told you to run. He'd find me out there. Imagine if he finds you here. I'm pregnant and if Spence knew, he would kill it. Why would he do that? Because he'd know it's not his. Lindsay! Help me. You got to trust me if you want to get out of here. I can... I can stop him. I can protect you. Lindsay! You know him better than me. What's he going to do? I can save you. Hey, fuck head! Why don't you come down here and we'll have a little chat? Things aren't going to plan, are they, Spence? What the hell is going on? Funny you should ask that. "What's going on?" You always know what's going on in your house. Anytime anyone is bad they get punished. You always know what's right for everybody. And yet here... here you ask me what's going on? You would say I'm a man without a soul, but I got to ask you, Spence. What do you think of a guy who imprisons his own wife? Why are you doing this? Maybe I just don't care anymore. You'll care. I'll make sure you care. But you're not very good at torturing people, Spence, at least torturing me. A-list job on your wife though I must say. This isn't going to end well for you now. There was no good end for me long before I entered your pathetic little world, Spence. I can only imagine the power you think you have. What you must do to make your wife a slave. You caused this pain! You're the one who did this to her! Gosh! She was broken long before I came along, Spence. It was only the child that kept her here. And you know it. Once he was gone, there was nothing left to keep her here. You pathetic, little man. Ah, two months, three weeks, six days, and one hell of a good morning to you. Aw, yeah! That was definitely worth the wait. I'd tell you to stay down, but this is really starting to turn me on. Enough! Stop. No. Riley, stop. Flesh is flesh. Pain is pain. Run. Or was it pain for pain? We'll figure it out. No! Do you ever think about what sex is, Lindsay? Sex is a scapegoat for insecurity, for lust, for power. And sometimes for sacrifice. You see it's so simple, but we make it so complicated, which coincidently is the flavor of what brought me to your little homestead here. I helped you. You guys torture people in your basement. You want gratitude from me? You're crazier than I am. Come on, Lindsay, we were doing so good. Aw... memories. Hey, Lindsay. Hey, Lindsay. Aw, Lindsay I can't make it on my own Aw, Lindsay Don't break up our happy home You're trying to avoid me, Lindsay? We try to repress our urges and when we do, we feel righteous, we feel strong. What are you pining for, Lindsay? You pining for me? You said your sister was raped. That's where I got my start. I got you now, Lindsay. Don't feel bad. Animal instincts are hardwired in us. They choose when to torture, they choose when to trust. Aw, Lindsay I can't make it on my own Don't break up our happy home Lindsay. Look what you've done to me. Look what you've done to yourself. We can only be who we are, Lindsay. The irony is I know we're all soulless. I presented you with an option. You chose revenge. You murdered my child! Gave you a new one. Fuck! How can you live on suffering? Ah, we all feed off suffering, Lindsay. Look at you. All these years of pain and hatred. Ah, pain, pain unites us all. Well then, I hope this really hurts. Ah, you little flirt. You almost hit me there. Spence? Spence? It's over. I should have never left you alone. Oh, you didn't know. If I was here, I could have protected you. It's not your fault. I should never have left you alone with him. You can't do this anymore. It's over. It is for me. Spence. Spence! Spencer! Don't leave me like this. Spence! You weren't supposed to see this. Spence, let me go. This is what you wanted, isn't it? No. I wanted us to be free. We're all going to die here. You're not killing only me. Who else am I killing? Please. No. His baby's inside you. You're right. I can't leave you here. I don't want you to suffer, Spence. Just let go. Mommy's sleeping. It's okay, baby.
