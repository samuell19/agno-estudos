'In Kanchana we saw how people used to be petrified on seeing Kanchana.' 'Heartbeats used to stop.' 'There would b complete darkness in front of the eyes.' 'Or one could say that the second name for being scared was Kanchana.' 'If Kanchana looks into someone's eyes..' '..that person can see his death coming.' 'If someone is scared of Kanchana then the crying of the baby..' '..the sound of the wind and the knocking of the doors..' '..also seem like a death call.' 'If a human gets scared, he will see Kanchana in his dreams too.' 'And then..' If Raghava hears about it, he will come here running.. Oh grandmother, oh grandmother. Brother in law, you have climbed the wrong tree. The tree does not matter, sister in law. Being safe from the ghost is more important. If your brother sees this, he will not spare me. Sorry sister in law. 'In Kanchana 2, if people used to look into Nandini's soul..' '..strong people used to be terrified..' 'Bravest of the bravest would get scared.' 'People used get scared to such an extent that he used to pray for death.' 'Not only ordinary people, even those saints who used to control the ghosts..' '..the people to work in the crematory and the priests of the church..' '..could not control Nandini.' This time she has come across some weird people. 'Such stupid idiots in front of whom..' '..the scariest ghost finds himself useless.' 'He is Tulsi Chande.' 'He seems to be a pure soul by his name..' '..but he is the world's biggest drunkard in reality.' 'After drinking a bottle in one go, he does not care whether..' '..there is a ghost in front of him or the ghost's father.' 'He is not less than a demon.' Hey stop, stop, stop.. A heavy toll has been put for a good collection. - Let him go. - Go. Hey listen I will buy you a new and expensive bottle. Hey, where are you coming from? You will stop me? I am a local citizen. - Really? - I am neither driving a car nor am I on a bike. I am going walking then to you have a problem. Okay okay go. Oh I understood that you have drunk an entire bottle. Stop it and come here. I said stop it. - Mr. Bansay, keep the phone. - Quite.. Hey, let that men come here. Come, let's go to the head. Go to the head. - I will tell him who am i. - Come.

Should I do the alcohol test sir? - Johnny, Johnny.. - Yes police. - Drinking whiskey? - No police. - Telling lies? - No police. - Open your mouth.. - Ha ha ha. Dear citizen, how do you save money to drink whiskey after paying tax? Drinking and driving is dangerous. Walking after drinking is more dangerous. Please take Mr. Citizen to the jail. Who am I? Pure Pandit. Officer, let's have a parade competition. If I lose, then put me into jail. If drunkards are to parade, then you will surely come first, citizen. But to take part in it you have to fill the entry from. For this you have to go to jail. I will not go to jail. I will sleep here and you will put up a tent for me. Whatever you want to do, do it here. Put that hot iron rod into my chest. Or put me into piping hot mustard oil and fry. But I will not to the police station. Oh Mr. Citizen, you gave me a great idea. I will obviously fulfill your dream. In that too, the idea of the iron rod is the best. - Take him and put the iron rod into him. - Leave. Officer, leave me. - Yes I am here. I shall talk to him. - Go, go. Sir, he is my friend. He drank too much in tension. Does this citizen drink every day? No sir. He lives in my neighborhood. - He tried to be very smart. - He will not do it now onwards. - Tell it to him. - Okay. - Take him. - Thank you sir. 'So we shall now meet a skillful, simple..' '..and a happy family with moral values.' 'This family is satisfied with their small happy moments..' '..that they do not care about the rest of the world.' Father, take the blessings. Stay blessed. - And now the offering. - What are you doing? And that's it. You take good care of me. Hey.. If you see it very closely, you will get spectacles. When will you learn?

There is a flood expected in Uttarakhand due to the heavy rainfall. Many buildings have collapsed. The roads have been blocked due to heavy rocks falling down. There is a lot of chaos in the city. The Alakhnanada river is overflowing with water.. ..that has reached a dangerous level. There is a lot of destruction in the low lying areas. The highway connecting Delhi and Haridwar has been stopped. According to the meteorological department.. ..such weather conditions are supposed to continue for the next 48 hours. - Hello. - Hello. - Hey Vimal. - Say. Oh Vimal, listen to me carefully. Did you get any news about my parents? I am tensed about them after seeing the news. I am trying for the past four five days.. ..but I am not able to get any information regarding them. Please try brother, I am really tensed. Have some patience. I am trying my best. Due to rains everything is hay wired. My friend, you have a lot of resources. Try and get some information. - Please. - Okay I will see. Don't worry Ram. It was my fault. I agreed to them and sent them alone. Nothing will happen if I sit here calmly. I have to go to India. Yes okay. Why have you got me here? I am sorry. I could not find your parents anywhere. I had to stop the search operations. There are some unidentified bodies in the hospital. Just go and check. You may recognize them. Ram. I could not even see the before they died. Whenever I see this house, it reminds me of my parents. I will not be able to stay here without them. I will finish all the formalities till next week.. ..and then return to Malaysia. I may not even come to India after this. What will you do of this house? What will I do of this house when my parents aren't alive? I shall sell it soon. Will have to find someone who will buy it. Take this aunt. May every parent get a child as capable and humble as you. Ram, I have talked to an agent whom I know. He told me that a family is interested in buying your house. See, tomorrow is an auspicious day. If you like their offer they shall do the housewarming rituals tomorrow. Grandfather, are ghosts for real? I am really scared grandfather. Deepa, no need to be scared. I know a good priest, I will call him tomorrow. - Okay? - Okay. Hey come here. You are overacting now. - Come here. - Sir, sir, sir, sir.. Hey where is the ghost? Show me. I swear upon my late mother. It is here only. - Sir, sir, sir.. - Are you playing a game with us? Sir, the ghosts play games here. They play hide and seek at night, sir. Ask Narayana. What if this is a lie? Then don't give me money. And shave off my beard and hair and make me sit on a donkey. Come Mr. Narayana. - This is the main hall. - Okay. You have to cook food there. That side is the bedroom where you can sleep together. And upstairs is the room to sleep alone. I shall show you the bathroom. Come madam. That toy is mine. That's my toy. Give me my toy back. - Father, father. - What happened child? There is a ghost's daughter in that room. There is nothing like ghosts. Go and play. Hey wait. There is a ghost in this house. You want to kill us. Fool. Hey wait. I found you. I found you, grandfather. Grandfather.. If you want to stay alive run from here. I swear upon my hair. There are many ghosts here. I can't believe this young man's talks. But we can earn a lot from his story. Hey, take this and enjoy. We shall spread rumors in the market.. ..that there are forty and not four ghosts in this house. Exaggerate and speak. - What will happen then? - Get lost. Yadav, Ram wants to sell this house fast. And there are rumors of ghosts in this house. We can get a lot of money from this house. Such opportunities don't come often. We shall destroy this house and bring up a multiplex. We will divide the profits as well. - Isn't this a great deal? - It's a great deal. - Let's get to work. - Let's go. Grandfather. Grandfather, grandfather. Careful. Sister.. Are we all dead? Have we become ghosts, sister? Grandfather, none of us remember that how and when we died. I am desirous of seeing grandmother. Once the body dies then even human relationships die. No doubt we are dead but love for grandmother is still alive. That is why our souls are still not at peace. Why don't we stay here till grandmother returns? The people who are going to come here will not let us stay here. They have come to know that we are ghosts. They will try to make us run away from here. I am not bothered. Till grandmother does not come we will not go from here. Sister, till we were alive we lived under the shadow of fear. Now what will we do after dying. Along with body the fear of mind has also died. Now we have nothing to lose. Till yesterday whatever was our weakness will now become our strength. To scare others is our weapon from today. Father really loved this car. Sir, keep these keys with you. This house is haunted. - I will not be able to sell it. - What nonsense are you talking? There is nothing as ghosts.. To reduce the rate you are spreading unnecessary rumors. Sir, if the house is sold at a good rate then I will get a good commission. - Forgive me, sir. I have small children.. - Hey, listen.. Are there really ghosts in the house? How could you get influenced by him? He is an uneducated agent. I know a big builder. His name is Yadav. He is not scared of ghosts..he will buy it. Today evening we will go to his office and talk to him. Greetings. Here comes the fool. Sit down. He wants to eat chicken but a vegetarian one. - Has the vegetarian chicken come? - Yes sir. - Fry it and get it. - He is a drunkard.. Thank you. Sit down. Sir, you cannot drink too much. You drink juice, offer prayers and earn goodness. Do you know priest and children are not allowed in bar? I will teach you a crash course in drinking. I have made many people drunkard and so I will make you also. Do you know my name? Blockbuster drunkard. Nice meeting you. Pick up the bottle and feel its weight. Tap it from top and bring its intoxication above. Sometimes the intoxication is stubborn and it does not come up in once. For that tap it from below and open the cap immediately. That's well played. Great shot. He has played it against the time. Hey, brother what are you doing? I am checking the book. Match is going on there and book is here. So he is a bookie. He will surely hit a six on the next ball. He hits very comfortably. This is good one.. The ball goes out. Very very big.. Hit again for a six. Bookie brother, even this ball will go for a six. Bet. The entire match is fixed. The next ball will also go for six. -This drunkard is going to be smashed. - Ball is in air.. - Priest.. - Leave me.. The planetary condition is not good. - Keep quiet. let him play. - Correct.. I am going to become rich. Oh no.. Foolish, this is an old match. Go and see the horoscopes.. Why didn't you tell me earlier? You were not ready to listen and see anything. By showing me an old match you made me a fool. - Give me money back. - Hey, take him out.. Listen.. - Leave me.. - Listen to me.. Friends work in progress.. Sir, he is a poor man. In frustration he will give birth to children. Quiet. Go and take order. Look Ram Babu, finalize the deal in 1crore. I shall make the entire payment today. The market value is 10crores and you are giving 1crore. It is very much for a house that is haunted. What is this? In modern times you believe in ghosts. God is not to be seen but men are seen. Even then there is more believe in God than in men. It is not matter of being seen but it is of faith and belief. Yadav, 1crore is very less. It is not more important than life. Think it over. This is final offer. Rest is your wish. I will give full cash. Hey Siddhu, do not take bill from them. I got you, sir. Did you hear? You want to go to Malaysia. He says that the house is haunted. Now what will you do? Talk to him and finalize the deal in the correct rate. I will talk to him again and then will call you. Don't take tension. Greetings..hello.. Sir can I say something which I should not be saying. I have n idea that will neither cause loss to you.. ..and the profit will not be known. People say that it is haunted. No one will be able to stay there. Sir if a human being cannot stay then how will ghosts stay. Then tell me what should be done. We will give the house on rent and will give cash back offer to the tenant. We will give free stay for 3nights and 4 days. They will stay there. The matter will spread. They will comment and share.. Then many people will come and will pay as per your rate. Will you be able to find such people who will be ready for this offer? Sir I know an unqualified person. He can do anything for money. That rascal is appropriate for this work. Shall we start mission roommate. Sir, do not miss my commission of the mission. I will give him a missed call. I think Siddhu is right. I remembered ghost on seeing this bungalow. How will ghosts harm us? We are godfather of ghosts. Hey, did you call the photographer? If we find any ghost then we will make a video.. ..and earn money through you tube. The photo would have come if there was ghost here. Hey, why are you taking my photograph? For safety, brother. If we do not find any ghost then we will upload your horror face. - Get lost.. - Hey, get lost from here.. Go.. That is my toy. Cute.. Oh no.. Phulwari, get up. There is ghost in the house. Phulwari, wake up. Brother Shankar, where are you? Phulwari.. This house is ours. Dear nurse cum mother. Water.. The water given by drunkard must be intoxicated. Mother, after eating one tablet the BP will lower.. ..but if I eat two then I will die. - Come on drink coffee. Come on. - No. - Laxmi.. - I am coming. Hurry up. Laxmi, take mother inside and let her rest. - She needs rest very badly. - Mother. She is losing her memory. Rest in peace, mother. Slowly, slowly cross the road. Okay, brother. Why are you so sad? What to tell you? The intoxication ruined everything. I lost money in gambling which I had kept aside for operation of the son. My wife has stopped giving me food. I would be grateful if you help me to get money back. Impossible. It is impossible to get money back from Yadav. We will have to earn this lost money from somewhere else. Brother Setu. Only you can help my dying son. Make arrangements for money for his operation. I have no expectation from that drunkard. Please save my dear son. I will make you eat delicious food. Please give me money for operation. This will cause trouble. Where is she gone? Emotional blackmail. - Get my money back. - Stop doing over acting. Sister-in-law made me emotional.. ..otherwise I would have taught you a lesson. - Wait, the money would come. - Till when? Hey, you beggar. I am going to finalize the deal. Have patience. Is everybody home? Brother, Shankar.. Get a side. Open the door.. Hey, let me go.. Who is there.. Wait, wait..where are you going? Mr..there is marathon in the village. Phulwari, what happened? Why are you lying down here? Wake up Sid. No hartbeat. Brother Shankar, hey brother Shankar.. Sir. Hey, you had said that there are three people. Where is the third one? He must be here. Who will be responsible if anyone dies? Only Yamraaj.. You are wasting time by getting involved in his foolish talks. No one will give better money than Yadav. Sir, one last chance please.. If you could not do it this time then what will you do further. I will stay here. I will stay here and prove that there is no ghost. Sir, please.. - Yadav.. - Yes, brother. - Where are you now? - In the bar. Okay I am coming with Ram to finalize the deal. - Okay. - Sir, please.. Come on Ram let's go and meet Yadav. Sir, please give me one last chance. Okay, I will give you one last chance. Last and final chance. If you stay here and prove that there is no ghost then I will give you 10% Thank you. Just check whether this old man is dead or alive. Okay sir. - Come on.. - Phulwari..no reply. Brother Shankar..brother Shankar.. Where are you, Shankar? Oh no.. Sorry, I could not see anything in tension. - Get a side. - Doctor has come. So, patient.. Your condition is like a dead body. We will have to do post mortem. The pulse rate is zero. I think you are about to die. But I am there. God should give this power to doctor that whom to kill and whom to save. Look at him. He consumed poison but we did not let him die. Just chill doctor..just chill.. Do not do too much chill otherwise I will have to give you pill. Next time consume poison of better quality. If you die then your postmortem will be free. If your condition deteriorates then take medicine with Ganges water. Take care of him. Why did you try to die? It is a long story. If you make a movie then will give two points. Please don't cry. Please don't cry. How much money you want? Heroine, location, director all together I need 50 lakhs. If you give me 1crore then I will become a hero. - Give me your lucky razor. - Okay, I will give. I hope you will not cut my throat. What else will I cut? Get my 10lakhs back. I am telling the truth that I shall shave your beard with new blade. I shall get it back for you. Do you think I am Reverse bank of Bangkok? Don't push me from behind. Shah Rukh of poor, Your life on road is useless. In three days of your life let me spend money. And then you will become famous at the multiplex. He took 10lakhs but you are trying to take everything I have. I have this razor left so how shall I give. Shall I make you fortunate with this razor? Sir.. He still has razor but I have nothing. I will do your work. Give me 10lakhs. Or give me 7.5 lakhs or even 4 lakh would do. I will do your work. Okay, deal done. From 10lakhs you have come straight to 4 lakhs. What happened with you? Hey brother, is the AC on inside. Superb.. Thank you. As soon as bank knows about the theft in ATM.. ..our security agency will get closed, brother-in-law. That is why we have kept money in ATM. When he will be thrashed 2-4 times then he will tell everything. Sir.. - Raja.. - Sir.. Is this an ATM or hotel for entertainment? That they gave rent for the room and went away. Or public toilet in which they passed urine and stool? No sir. Did you see the video? What did you understand after seeing? What were you doing? Show the film after the interval. - Raja.. - Sir.. I am not boasting but you play it well. Your aunt has spoiled my mood. Play such a tune that I forget your aunt. You play it so well. Your case is closed before writing. This is promise by police. Now we are friends. Sir, thank you. - Now do one thing. - Yes, tell me. - Return that stolen money. - Okay. Sir, I don't have that money.. - Child.. - I swear sir. - Don't you have money? - No sir. - Will you play flute? - Why would I lie? Father.. Stop playing flute. After hearing the tune tears have started falling from my eyes. I understood. We all are in pain. If you work for me then I will give everyone 10lakhs cash. - Yes. - What? Even after hearing 10lakhs this useless man has not become happy. - His ear machine is out. - A good chance. If you work for me then I will give you 10lakhs. - 10 lakhs.. - Control.. - You are great sir. - Wait. [Sanskrit slok] Oh God. Come. What is this? Where are you? Who are you people?

Your brother has come to meet you. Brother.. Brother.. Sister.. What is going on? I don't know what is going on. Everyone is sitting. I do not know who they are. What are you doing here? Whom did you ask before coming here? - Come on get up.. - Sir, I will tell you. Please listen, sir. The soul of my family members is stuck here. After asking them that where my Aadhaar card is I will go from here. - In which age are you living? - Please sir. And what is the soul of your family doing in my house. - Believe me, they are here. - What nonsense is this? No, no..Vimal, remove everything from here. - Sir please, don't do this. - Get lost from here. Hey, he threw the Tantric. Hey, these souls are trapped here for some reason. They have to take revenge.

Okay, go from here. - Everyone will be finished. - Get lost from here. - What you have done. She will not spare you.. You did not believe the agent. Out of the three people who stayed here last night two have become mad.. ..and the third one is still missing. - By now he must have died. - Ghosts stay here. This means it is a haunted bungalow. All these are fake talks. That is not the case. Hey, have you brought them here to die. Have you all come here for picnic? If anyone dies then who will be responsible. - Why will anyone die? - What is this Ram? Enough is enough.. - Sir.. - One second.. Siddhu, you wanted one last chance. - Wanting, sir. - Okay I give it. If everything happens according to the plan.. ..then not 10% but will give you 20% Done sir. I will come and check tomorrow morning. It is fine if you are able to stay the entire night. Otherwise I will finalize the deal with Yadav. - Staying, sir.. - Let's go Vimal. Nonsense naughty, sage. So much lemonade would have been made with these many lemons. Consider it your residence. Bathroom is that side and bedrooms on first floor. Why are you worried? Sir you did not do right with us. You did not tell us that there are ghosts here. You cheated us. Believe me that I did not cheat you. I am a priest but believe more on ghosts. I will not believe even if God comes and says that there is no ghost. In childhood I never used to stammer.. ..but after seeing the ghost I got into the habit of stammering. I will not be able to do this. Please.. But.. On losing 10lakhs I was not so scared as I am now on hearing about the ghost. I can fight with Bahubali but do not have strength to fight with ghosts. For the sake of my future mother-in-law.. Fear, fear..from who will you be scared? Fear of losing child, fear of wife leaving.. ..the fear of not giving a hit after becoming a hero.. ..fear of living a life in jail after doing robbery. You will live in fear, die in fear. You will be scared of God as well as ghost. You will live in fear and will die of fear.. If you want to live then kill the fear and live. I will face fear alone.. ..and that too by staying here alone without three of you. God help those who show courage.. If because of fear your mothers would not have given birth to you.. ..then would you be existing now. You are lucky that nature gave you another chance to live. And I am giving you a chance to make it better. If today you accept defeat because of fear then you will always lose. - Who will support me? - I.. - Who will win over fear? - I.. - Who will face fear boldly? - I.. Hail to Maheshmati.. Hail to Maheshmati.. - Is everything okay? - Yes sir. - Is everyone ready? - Ready, sir.. Why are you standing behind? You face it. We will encourage you. We will cheer you from behind. You are our leader, sir. And the leader cheats everyone. Don't you know this? Joking..responsibility.. Hey..sometime back you shouted that you were ready. And now you are vibrating. By shouting I have gained confidence. You carry one. Today I will do shave of ghost. Maintain your confidence. Raju, no one is leader here. We are team her and team members.. Learn something from him. He has lifted his dhoti to fight.. I have lifted to run away from here. Will you run after defeating ghost in race? Suddenly I remembered that I had to go for a naming ceremony of child. So I shall go and make offerings. He will not go anywhere. Everyone will stay together. Hold each other's hand. Come on hold it. - Ready.. - Ready.. - Everything okay. - Okay.. One, two, two and a half, three.. Hail Mahismati.. Leave me. Leave me. What are you doing here? Do you want to die? There is ghost here as well as inside. If you want to save your life then go from here. Go.. - Who is he? - I am going. - Sir, was he a ghost? - He is a man. But he drinks a lot so his face is like that of ghost. I had kept him inside so that no one is scared of him. Sir, does the fear become less by eating this tablet. I will die if I do not eat this tablet. What are you talking? If you die then you will also become a ghost. Don't die sir. That is not in my hands but in the hands of the heart. It was okay if you talked about bad liver.. ..but what is the matter of bad heart. What should I tell you? A woman disempowered me. - Are you going in flashback? - Yes. I will give background music. - Give an emotional one. - Okay. 'Greetings future mother-in-law.' 'What are you doing?' 'I am not touching your feet but picking up the paper.' 'Your daughter and I want to get married.' 'Not that one but this one..' 'As soon as you give green signal we will get married.' 'Is this true?' 'Yes, I want to get married to him.' 'If you marry him and go then who will marry your younger sister.' 'I am old and may die anytime.' - 'If I die then who will get her married. - Mother..' 'What about me? Once I die no one is going to be bothered.' 'But do not think about us. Start planning your honeymoon.' 'If she had good figure then even she might get someone.' 'God, I want to die before their marriage.' - 'And you go and eat poison. Oh God, my luck.. - No! No!' 'Mother, I may die..' '..but before my sister gets married I will neither get married nor die.' - 'I swear upon my mother. - I am so proud of you my child.' 'You take so much care of your younger sister.' 'Let me go and see if she has really consumed poison.' - 'Dear, understand the situation. - I understood.' 'Before our marriage we will have to fix your sister's marriage.' - 'Am I right? - Yes, you are right.' 'Mother, you strong on has got job in Belgaum.' - 'Take this and live your life. - May God bless you?' 'You got this foolish boy a job.' 'The work of both children is done..' '..so now when will you give us permission to get married.' 'You fulfilled all the wishes of this old woman..' '..and now want to fulfill your own wish, son.' 'Correct. You are right.' 'Child, even you are fluttering.' 'I am dying to marry him just like a frog jumps without water.' 'Marry him.' 'I do not know what kind of daughter-in-law will come..' '..when your brother gets married.' 'Maybe she thrashes me or gives me poison.' 'Don't worry about me. Go..' 'May God rest my husband's soul in heaven?' 'By putting three children in my lap he went to heaven.' 'Mother..' 'I worked hard to bring up three of you.' 'And now you all are leaving me and going.' - 'Old woman.. - Mother..' - 'My daily needs.. - I promise..' - 'Her youth.. - Whatever may happen..' 'May go waste but will not let her be mine.' 'First you will die and only then I will get married.' 'I will not speak further. You only speak.' 'I swear upon you.' 'You are not my daughter but son.' 'I did not make a mistake by giving birth to you.' - 'Dear.. - My dear..' 'When will we get married?' - 'Forgive me. - Enough..' 'I feel scared seeing your hand.' 'Now I feel that I will lie down on the death pyre along with your mother.' 'There is only one option left. In one room kitchen..' '..we will adjust mother as well.' 'And we will do work together..' 'Naughty boy..' 'Shelu..mother-in-law, call Shelu.' 'I have brought samples of cards so that she can select.' 'Now card will not be required.' 'Why mother-in-law? Where is Shelu?' 'She had gone to cow shed to get milk but has still not returned.' 'She knows that I put more milk in my coffee.' 'So she must be getting it.' 'From today get into the habit of black coffee.' 'She eloped with the milkman.' 'I am sorry Siddhu. The fault is mine. I fell in love with him.' 'He was very honest. He never added water in milk.' 'No knows what God has in store for everyone.' 'That day the packet milk got over for tea.' 'I went to his cow shed to get milk and fell in love with him.' 'Ask mother to buy packet milk.' 'Consider my mother as yours and take care of her.' 'I am sorry Siddhu. The fault is mine. I fell in love with him.' 'He was very honest.' 'He never added water in milk. That was God's willingness.' 'My God..' 'What happened, sir?' 'Normally there are nine holes in the heart.' 'But very few have an extra hole.' 'Am I that lucky man?' 'Not you but I am lucky.' 'Because of that hole I will become rich.' 'Oh no..my girlfriend is responsible for making this hole in my heart.' 'This is not because of your girlfriend..' '..but you have been gifted with it at birth.' - 'We have come to know about it today. - How much would be the cost?' 'Just a matter of 50. I will sew the hole.' '50,000/- I will have to break the piggy bank.' 'Not 50,000/- but 50 lakhs.' 'Mother, I am dead.' 'Hey don't touch him. The deal hasn't been finalized.' 'If you take tension on every matter..' '..then instead of operation we will have to do postmortem.' 'How much does that cost?' 'It is free of cost in government hospital.' 'For free? Then I shall go and get it done now.' 'That cannot happen now. For that you will have to die.' 'Oh..but sir I have 49lakhs less.' 'With such a small amount I cannot sew such a big hole.' 'If you want then shall I give you an advice for free?' 'If it is free then give..' 'Have you heard about reverse emotional therapy?' - 'What does that mean? - How do you react when you are very happy?' - 'I laugh a loud. - From now try to cry.' 'What do you do when you are scared?' 'I start vibrating because of fear.' 'Look, when you feel scared then laugh aloud.' 'Now tell me what will you do on seeing the ghost?' 'I will laugh, sir.' 'And when you hear a joke.' - 'I shall cry. - Very good.' 'Till you follow this therapy you will live.' - 'What if I do not follow? - Then you will die.' 'Discharge this poor fellow.' 'Take 25,000/- for the water we sprinkled..' '..to help him gain consciousness.' - 'Doctor.. - Reverse emotional therapy.' 'I forgot..doctor..' 'Make payment or otherwise stay back in hospital.' One thing is common among us. Bad luck and no money. - Money is oxygen for us. - He is right. Life without money is just like a flat Mercedes tyre. We will have to take risk to lift up from the poverty line. If there are ghosts here then we will die. Even outside this house we were dying only. Till we do not stay here for four days we are not going to get any money. Hey, how did you come in this haunted house? I shall make cocktail of your blood and drink.

He has not disconnected the phone but his life line. - Has the work been done or not? - They do not believe on ghosts. Fake tantric decided to scare them but they did not get scared.

How will anyone believe in ghosts without eyes? We will show them ghosts. On seeing that they will get scared. And they will escape because of fear. I am missing grandmother a lot. Will she come and meet us here? She will surely come one day. Who knows in what condition and where madam would be? Would she be missing us or not? What if she has also died like us? My heart says that she is absolutely fine. She will surely come here finding us. That is why we will wait for her. Even if many years pass by. Why have you put red lipstick and worn white sari? Ghosts have long nails and shining eyes. If there is really a ghost then it will not spare you. This is not first night but a night to kill. Stupid. Even a ghost would get scared on seeing this black dress and face. You need glamour to scare. Come on. You seem to be a witch even without make up. If we have to stay in this house.. ..then we will have to throw those four people out. There is victor ahead of fear. I will go and scare them. We have to scare them to the core.

Come, I will perform your last rites too. 'What are you doing? He is your father.' 'But then how will you get this house.' 'Rest in peace.' Mother, mother.. You must have been shocked seeing your son killing your family. What curse can be more than this for a mother? God should never give a son like this to anyone. It is better not to have a child rather than having one like this. We were thinking that we four are in trouble.. ..but these ghosts are in more trouble than us. You are right. We are in trouble but at least are alive. We will have to do something to get these unfortunate souls. - And they will get liberation by justice. - You are right. - Hello, Mr. Ram.. - Tell me Siddhu.. Your mother has come back from Uttarakhand. - Really? - Come as soon as possible. - I'll be there in 10 minutes. - Okay. I was going through pending cases.. ..then I came across a file of missing complaint. On enquiring we came to know that this woman lives with Siddhu. He found her near his house. That woman never went to Uttarakhand. Having a real son someone else gave him the position of a mother. Do you know who the real son is? I may not be as rascal as you but I am no less. Listen, I shall give you a suggestion. Take this one rupee coin, transfer the house in our name.. ..and go to Malaysia by the first flight. Hey Mr. Yadav. How can you enter like this? - This is cheating. - Tell me where is his mother? - Come in the corner. - Go or I'll kill him. Tell me where is Ram's mother? Tell me. - Where is she? - Brother Yadav, one minute. Siddhu, thank you. - Thank you very much. - Welcome. You gave very good news. Tell me where is my mother? Mother, mother.. Mother, how are you? I am happy to see you alive. Was the journey good? Sit down. Why are you standing? Come. Sit down. Come. Come..sit down. Where is father? He must be taking resting upstairs. What is this mother? You left for pilgrimage without telling me. I found you everywhere from hospital to old age home. Now you are found. I felt very happy to see you. Wait for a minute. I will just be back. Hey, I killed my father for this.. ..and this secret was revealed to you. So you should also be killed. Sir, please.. Sir.. Yadav, along with mother send them to heaven as well. - No, you cannot do this. - Please don't kill us. I don't want to die. Don't kill us. No. No! I don't want to die. Hey, hey.. Thank you, God. We are saved. 'You made us orphans.' 'Ram, you killed everybody. Ram, you killed everybody.' Ram. What has happened? - What is this? - Come. - Footage king, come.. - Friends, wait.. What happened? Great! This is magic. Oh, God! Thank you..
