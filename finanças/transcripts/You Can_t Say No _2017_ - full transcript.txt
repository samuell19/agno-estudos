Well I was on my way to Jenny's for the weekend. And I saw your bike being loaded up. And the guys at the auto shop said that you were here. Where are the kids? With Nana. Looks like you found some company. What can I get ya? I would love a little something something. And can you get him a beer too? She drank mine. Sure, two beers coming up. Thanks. So which way are you going over to your dad's? Going east to Squaw Bridge. Oh I love that bridge. I'm gonna jump off. What? Oh that didn't sound right, did it? No, it did not. That bridge is really high. Yeah, but the water's really deep. I've wanted to jump off since I was a kid. Why is it so important that you jump off now? I don't know, Alex. Life's short. I don't wanna be laying on my death bed, saying to myself god dammit, I wish I'd jumped off that bridge. You sound like your dad. Here you go. Thank you. And for you sir. Sorry about that. Can we get the check? Yeah sure, of course. I'll be right back. Thanks. I'm going with you to the bridge. Why? Well if you die, then someone should really be there. It's a long way down. I know. Are you sure you're in the right spot? I think so. And people jump off this bridge all the time, right? You're freaking me out Alex. Jump, you pussy! Fuck you! Wow. Monday morning. Yeah, some time Monday. Bike needs a new part. Won't be here until Monday. What are you gonna do? See if my dad can come get me. You wanna use my phone? Nah, I'm gonna finish up in here and head over to the bar. Do you want a ride to your dad's? That's totally outta your way. I'm fine. Okay. Alright. Yeah okay. Have fun at Jenny's. Hank. What else haven't I known about you all these years? So you're proposing that we play a divorced couples Truth or Dare? Yeah, if you wanna call it that. But each day I pick one thing and you pick one thing that we can do or ask each other. Like? Like jump off Squaw Bridge. Which I didn't do. Yeah but now the rule is you can't say no. What if you pick something and I don't do it? Then the game is over and you're a loser. Oo I hate losing. How you guys doing on those beers? Oh, we're good. Can I get you anything else? Yes, do you have two pens and a piece of paper? I do. Thank you, we will give these back. Okay. Alright. So if can also be anything that you always wanted to do with one another but maybe never asked. Like? Like I don't know, I mean use your imagination. Oh don't be creepy. Just make your choices and fold, like write on one side and then fold it and put your initial on the top. Two. Oh thank you Mrs. Alex. Oo, is that how you treat your students? Yeah, when they're really bad. Are you in or out? I'm in. Great. Okay. I have a question. Is it one of your four? Seriously? I mean if you want an honest answer. Okay, fine. I'm using my first one. The game starts now. Were you really going to Jenny's? Huh, first question. No. She's so good. At least we made some pretty amazing kids. I guess now we know it's girlfriends for Penny, huh? God, I know. For now. God, she sure sends you a lot of emoticons. I like it. I think it's her way of reminding me that she loves me. Where are we going? To the city. I have a friend that's gonna hook us up. What does that mean? That's my dad. Oh, answer it. Hey Dad. Henry, what are you doing? I'm in the car with Alex. You're on speaker phone, so don't say anything inappropriate. Hi Alexandra. Hi Buck. My grandkids in there? No. You two getting back together? Dad! What do you want? You still coming up here? We are at some point. We? Alex is giving me a ride. Why are you calling her phone? Well I sort of got into a car accident this morning. How do you sort of get into a car accident? Are you okay? Do you need us to come pick you up? No, no no, I'm fine. I'm in the hospital now in town. God damn insurance thing. Don't worry about it. Miles is coming to get me. What happened? Dad? He hung up. That's so your dad. I should go. Yeah, we should go. Oh my god. Let me help you. Oh Alex, thanks. Oh what the hell did you do to your neck, Dad? It's nothing. They're just making me wear this damn thing so I don't sue 'em. Well I'm sure if you're wearing it it's for a reason. You ever check in? Guys. Hi! - I thought that was your car. - Miles! - What the hell did you do? - He said you were gorgeous. Aw, you look great too. Hey, Hankie. Oh hey Miles. Oo, we just got back from the hospital. That's great. Here Dad, put this behind your back. Oh no no no no no, here, look what I got. I just went by my house. Here. This has 15 different massage settings on it. Yeah, I think there's an outlet right back there. Do you mind plugging that in? All Shiatsu my friend. Well thank Miles. Anything for you Bucko. And listen, if you need an extra set of hands around the vineyard, anything at all, you just gimme the word, okay? I'm fine and I don't need anything. So good to see you guys. You gotta come up here more often. I know. I wish we could. Alex and I are... I don't know what I would do without your old man. It's so special what he does with my grapes. - Ugh. - Yeah, the 2014 Syrah. - Yes. - Double gold. Did you hear that? Yeah! Anyway I gotta get back to the fundraiser. You guys should come by the pillow fight. It starts in a few minutes. Pillow fights? Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Hey, you can go if you want. - I think I will. - I'll stay here with Dad. Yeah. Can you enter? Yeah, $20 donation and then you get to challenge somebody. Great, I challenge you. Seriously? Yeah, I'm gonna use my first one. On a pillow fight? I can use it for whatever I want. You scared? No, I'm not. You're on. Oh, I wish I could see this. - Oh sweet. - Let's do this. Oh and Matilda's gonna come by with some food for you in a little bit, Bucko. Okay? Uh Miles, I've told you time and again don't call me Bucko or I'll knock your teeth out. Well not now because Alexandra's here and I got this on. Sorry. I just think you're gonna like her, that's all. It's my new chef. She's so amazing. Oh and I almost forgot those DVDs from eBay, they just arrived. Dad you can't do that. Sit back and relax, alright? Yeah. - Okay. - Rest up for Kung Fu night, Bucko. Hmm, yeah great. You just, you know what, why don't you all leave me alone? - Just get on outta here. - Gees, grumpy. Skate on outta here.

Uh, sure. - Yeah. - Terrific, 'cause Alex and I actually, we really need some alone time. Okay. Alone time, okay. Come on stud. Yeah, let's go. God I gotta come up with an excuse for firing her. She cannot take a hint. I'm sorry for using you like that. Oh no, I don't mind. Ugh. I hope Hank doesn't mind either. Yeah, he doesn't care. You know we're not together anymore. Really, what? We're signing divorce papers next week. Oh my god, what happened? Hank had an affair. - No. - Yeah. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. Well, we had other issues, trust me. I mean if it wasn't him it probably would've been me. Jesus, I'm sorry. What are you doing here together then? That's a great question with a complicated answer. Yeah? I, I need a drink. Let's go over here. ♪ The leaves are green black ♪ He's been with that girl the last couple of hours. Hasn't he? - Alex? - Yeah. Whoa, you alright? - Yeah. - No, she's... I knew it. Are you and Miles dating? Is that what's going on? No. It's that he's so into that girl that he's with. Really, you think so? Yeah, it's obvious they're both so into each other. No. There's no way. Yes. Drink. Uh no, I'm good. I'm good, thank you. Are you okay? Are you alright? Huh? Ugh, oh okay. Alright. Ah yeah. You're gonna be okay. Um hmm, I know. Is he watching? Is who watching? Oh god! What the hell? Ugh. That's disgusting. That was gross. You puked in my mouth! Ugh. I'm going back. Don't tell Miles. Who is it? I'm Matilda. I brought you something to eat. Just a sec. God dammit. Ow. Oh Jesus Christ. Okay, come in. Oh. I can't reach my clothes. I'm... Thank you. Do you need clothes? Honestly? No, I actually prefer to be in my underwear. Okay. Oh that looks good. Ow! Damn. I'll help you if you put clothes on. Okay, fine. Hey, here. Nevermind. I mean if you wanna try it, I'm here for you. I mean I'll even try to stay outta your way. I don't know. No, whatever you need. Seriously. A shoulder to cry on. Look here, a lid to keep the sun away from your fair beautiful skin. - Thank you. - Looks like you guys are having a good time. We are. Oh, thank you for getting those pillows. We're fighting first. Good. That's good. Miles is doing some really cool stuff these days. Oh is he? That's so great. How is Pepper? Oh she's so funny, hilarious. Hey, everybody come over here. I've got a microphone and some words for you. Miles is doing such good things for schools these days. Oh yeah? God that's so great. He's looking really good too. Hello everybody, thank you so much for coming out. Friends, Sonomans, strangers on my property. I wanna thank you all for coming out for this wonderful cause today. Your local schools. Give yourselves a huge round of applause. Thank you so much for being here. And now our first friends up. We have Hank and Alex. Alex, guys, choose your pillows. Choose them wisely. Here are the rules, folks. Three knock downs is a knock out. You got it? You can only use your pillows. You cannot punch, you cannot kick, you cannot scratch, you cannot shove. If you break these rules you're automatically disqualified. Folks, let's let these games begin. You have fun in the parking lot? Just as much fun as you had with Miles. Good, 'cause you can do whatever you want with whoever you want. Good, then you won't care that she kissed me. Get her Hank! Destroy her for me. The boy goes down. Wow. It looks like we have an incredibly powerful contender here. There's a lotta story here to this fight. And he's back up. Folks, what's gonna happen next? I hate you! Then it's a good thing we're getting divorced. Oh that's not okay. Oh hey, hey hey! That's what I was talk. I'm afraid folks that we have an automatic disqualification for my friend Alex Murphy. It's not Murphy. It's Jackson! How was the pillow fight? That bad, huh? Here. Try some of this. It's yum. Fountain Grove Appalachian. I don't feel like drinking wine. Just try it. I wanna know what you think. Jesus Christ Dad. Relax. It's for the pain. Didn't the hospital give you pain pills? This works better. Where do you get weed? Miles. How's the wine? 'Course you got weed from Miles. What, did he buy a weed farm for cancer patients somewhere? What? What's wrong with you? Where's Alexandra? Don't know and don't care. By the way that's some damn good wine, Dad. I know. Do you like this one? It's a little, like sweet. Which was unexpected for this kind. Hello Hank. Can we talk? Talk. Can we talk outside? Fine. Hey, did you give my dad weed? Nirvana. - What? - Nirvana, that's the name of the weed. It's good for pain and sleeplessness. Oh wow, that sounds really good. Yeah it is, would you like some? - No. - Okay. Why are you even here? I don't know why I'm here. Maybe I should leave tomorrow. I don't want you to leave. I was just, I was just jealous of you and Miles. Is that why you kissed slutty McGhee? I didn't kiss her. She molested me in the parking lot and puked in my mouth. That chick is insane. That's gross. It is gross. Is that why you kicked my ass today? Yeah, I'm sorry. Just, the past came back to me with that chick. So you're really jealous of Miles? Yeah, yeah, I don't know. You, he's paying all this attention to you and he's doing fundraisers for school kids. And he's rich and he's giving my dad Shiatsu massage pillows. Seriously, Hank. This isn't easy for me to admit, you know. I don't even have a job. I know it isn't easy for you. But, it's good that you're talking about it. I'm glad that you're talking about it. Can we keep playing the game tomorrow? You sure that's such a good idea? You backing out? I am not! Am I interrupting? - No. - Good. - No you're not. - Good. I found those pills that we discussed earlier. What's that? Molly, round two tomorrow. Yeah, Alex told me all about what you guys are doing. I just think it's so bold and it sounds like good fun. - I'd really like... - What the hell haven't you guys talked about? Oh. I'm sorry. I'm gonna go pour some more wine. Maybe put on a few tunes. - Alright. - Sounds great. I caught my dad smoking weed today out of a bong. It's not funny. It's definitely funny. Coffee? Oh my god, yes. Um, that's good. Um hmm. And these our papers? Um hmm. Are you still up for the magic pill pick today? Yes I am. Okay, here goes. Alright. Oh Hank, seriously? Ha, your rules. I hated that job in high school. Well that's why I never asked. This is really your fantasy. You have no idea what that outfit did for me as a teenager. What outfit, what magic pills? Those my Pop-Tarts? - Yeah. - Will you make me one? Um hmm. I'm gonna go shower so I can go into town and mug some poor girl after her shift. Oh do you think you can handle finding us a place to stay tonight? I'm already on it. Wow. Gees, don't seem so shocked. - Yeah. - There you go. Um hmm. Ah. Uh, what's going on between you and Alexandra? What do you mean? Well most people about to get divorced don't do the things you two seem to be doing. I don't know, it's complicated Dad. Probably like you and Mom were. No. That wasn't complicated. I just fucked it up. I regretted it ever since, too. Mind if Alex and I go somewhere tonight? No no, no problem. It's Kung Fu night. I used to ask you to watch Kung Fu movies with me all the time. Did I? No, but you like watching it with Miles now. Oh. Henry, Miles is just this lonely kid trying to figure it all out. I mean he's got lots of money now because of what happened and I'm sure not a day goes by where he doesn't wish he had his dad or the rest of his family with him instead of me. Now can I have my Pop-Tarts? Hmm, num num. Oh and would you go and get my clothes from the bedroom? Really? I'm taking Matilda out to the vineyard today. Okay. You can open your eyes now. - What? - Check it out. No! - Oh! - Yes. Yes! Uh huh. Well done. I hear there's a tree net on the property somewhere too. Seriously? That's excellent. Woo, watch your head. Whoa, this place is badass. - Yes. - Yes! This tiny little stove. That is a loft. Beers in the fridge. Oh, there's an outdoor shower. Deck, whoa. We're in a tree, we're staying in a tree tonight. We're staying in a tree. - That's right. - That's right. Let's get a beer. No prob. Thanks. Let's go find this tree net. Let's do it. Pills? You sure you wanna do this with me? Are you sure you wanna do this with me? That looks so goody on you. Thank you. That's an amazing flower. I think it's super beautiful. You know what I always hated about you? What? You always shut me out when you were mad. I know. You know what I always hated about you? What? It's that you never trusted me to make a decision on my own. I'm sorry. I know, I'm sorry. Me too. Me too. I always hated all the mess piles you left around the house. You wanna kiss me? Yes. I do. That's Penny. Penny? Hi Mom! Oh hi sweeties. Hey, hey kids. Oh hey Dad. What are you guys doing together? We are on a tree net. Here, this is the ground. Whoa, that's awesome. Wow, you're really high. What's so funny? You guys are acting kinda weird. Nothing sweetheart. Your brother's right, we're really high. In the trees. Yep, in the trees. What's going on? Are you with Hank? - Oh, hey Nana! - Hi. I can't see you anymore, it's frozen. Oh I can see you just fine. Bye Mom, love you kids. I can't believe we just talked to our kids online.
