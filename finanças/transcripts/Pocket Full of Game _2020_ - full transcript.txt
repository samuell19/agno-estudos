Yo, Fresh, you all right? - Look at my face, bro. Does it look like I'm all right? - What, that mistake? - Mistake? Motherfucking Starbucks employees could afford to make mistakes. Motherfuckers who work at Burger King and McDonalds could afford to make mistakes. One mistake in our line of work will get you head blown off, man. That bitch of yours almost got me killed last night. If that nigga's aim had been slightly better, this wouldn't be a bandage over my face. It'll be a fucking ziplock. I'm telling y'all man, that shit was real sloppy. It could have gotten me shot and one of us killed. - Yo I spoke to her about that, Fresh. - Fuck a talk, she's out, man. - What?! - [Fresh] You heard me nigga, she's out. - Yo, I understand she slipped up bro, but she's loyal! - I remember the last time a nigga in this crew slipped up. Yeah, Cash knows the answer to that one. I did 10 years behind that shit. Behind another nigga's slip up. Shit ain't happening again. And her cut of the money is coming out of your part of the take. Your bitch, your idea to bring her in, your money. Ain't no way in hell I'm splitting shit with a bitch who almost got my head blown the fuck off, man. - But that's gonna mean we gonna need a new hook. - New hook? Yo, despite what happened last night, Lady's the only female I trust to hold my life in her hands. I don't trust these other bitches! - She's out, man. You saw how shook she got after I blew that nigga's head off last night, man. - Yo, Bone. You think Lady gonna keep her mouth shut about that Goldie job? - [Bone] Of course! - I hope so. 'Cause a dead bitch definitely can't tell the police a damn thing, homie. - Yo, don't you think I know that? I'd take her out myself if I knew she was gonna snitch! - I hope so. - [Announcer] Attention MTA customers, next stop transferring, E line 47 easy line trains.

'Cause my money's tight and this recession shit is fucking up my pocket. - I don't know, shorty, you have a few that been complaining this shit weak. - Yeah, well I gots to cook this shit down to the oil in them, B, 'cause we need butter out here in them streets. - They keep coming back, don't they? I don't give a fuck. Stretch that shit out. - Aight we got you. Damn bro, this recession shit hard. That's why it's never good to only have one hustle. - Man, but if we're selling blow up, man, shit gonna slow down, man, specially when they got butter up their blouse, B. - I'm looking into other shit, man. Damn, you all couldn't order a bitch, not a drink, no juice, nothing? - I ain't your man, shorty. - Shit, I'll be your man, get you something to eat, drink, all of that shit. - It's called being a gentleman. - You said it yourself, we in a recession and money tight, right? Besides, I never said I was no gentleman. - All right, that's my cue, man. I'ma get busy. I'ma go handle this business and shit like that. - That's fucked up. I'ma go get my juice. Can I get a little flame and a shot of OG? - Got you right there. - [Porsha] Thank you. What, what you looking at? - You know what. You just gonna sit there and ignore the elephant in the room? - Chase, that shit that happened the other day, that shit shouldn't have happened. - But it did. And I've been thinking about you ever since. - [Porsha] Come on. - I'm serious. - [sighing] Like, so what? - Well, I'm serious. Porsha you know I've been feeling you for years now. - Chase, you know you're community dick and I can never settle down with a nigga like you. - You're acting like a nigga can't change specially for the right woman. - I didn't say a man can't change, but I'm not gonna wait for somebody to change. - Porsha, what other nigga you know is gonna protect you and hold you down in the streets the way that I would? - [Porsha] I don't know. - So at least think about me before you shoot me down. - Yo, you know that nigga right there? - [Chase] What nigga? - [Porsha] The nigga that just walked out of here. - I don't know him personally. I know he used to run with Jazz and Geez back in the day. Why, what's up? - [Porsha] What's his name? - Fresh. Why, what happened? - Like I said, I'ma be looking into other shit. - Where you going? - [Porsha] Looking into other shit. - [Fresh] Whoah, whoah, what's your problem, sugar? - Oh you don't know a bitch, now, huh Fresh? - No I don't know you and just because you know my name doesn't mean you know me. - Oh, is that right huh? Let me tell you what I do know. I know you and your crew robbed and killed Goldie last night. And you don't got that scar on your face 'cause you was cutting yourself shaving. - I don't know what you're talking about, man. - You know exactly what I'm talking about. - Listen, shorty, mind your business before you fuck around and make me get all up in yours. - Relax, chill. Your secret's safe with me. As far as I'm concerned, you did me a favor. Goldie was my competition. So I really don't care about him clocking out of here early. - Then what the fuck you want, conversation? 'Cause a nigga ain't got time right now, man. - Listen, I know Goldie had a lot of money in that apartment. And I'm sure he's not the only one y'all have hit. - Jump to the chase, shorty, I got shit to do, man. - [Porsha] I want in. - I told you before, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Listen, that bitch y'all ran out of there with, that was your little plug or whatever, right? [laughing] She was so scared running down them stairs I could tell, she nearly pissed on her pants, I bet when you killed Goldie, right? [laughing] She did. You need a bitch who ain't scared of blood. - And you that bitch, huh? - I sure am. - Get the fuck off my truck. Yo, meet me in the park in three days. I need to talk to you about something. - [Cash] Fresh, what's up bro? - [Fresh] What you doing, Cash, how are you? - [Cash] Chilling. - Good. - You out here early I see. - I mean, doing what I do. - All right, all right. Came to see what was going down. - I saw shorty three days ago, man. - Who? - Shorty from the Goldie job, man. - That bitch from the hallway? - Yeah. - [Cash] She saw you? - Yeah she saw me man. She ran down on me and all that. Knew my name and all that. - What happened? - Said she just wanted to talk. - Talk? About what? - Said she want to be a part of the crew, man. - [Cash] Part of the crew, that's it? - Yeah. - [Cash] What she want to be a part of this crew for? Last time I checked, we ain't fucking recruiting. - I don't know Cash. - Look, Fresh, I don't trust her. She saw your face and Lady's face. She could be fucking with the cops. You ever thought about that shit? I knew I should've taken care of her in the hallway, man, I knew it. What'd you tell her? - I told her to get the fuck on, man. - [Cash] You aint tell her shit else? - Of course I ain't tell her shit else, man. You know me better than that, man. - Think she fucking with the cops? - [Fresh] I doubt it, man. - You doubt it? - Your black ass still free, ain't you? If she was fucking with police we'd be in jail by now, man. - And I feel you on that one, man, I feel you. Look, we still don't trust her. We might have to burn this bitch. - I tell you the truth, Cash. I just don't get that type of energy from her, man. She doesn't seem like that type of person, man. - Seem like that type of person? You don't even know her. What, you got that from talking to the bitch for a hot second? She let you smell the pussy too? Wake up, man. - You a funny nigga, cash. - Come on. - I mean you saw how she held her own on the hallway that day. Most bitches would have shit at themselves with all them guns pointed at them. Fuck, most niggas would have to. She didn't though, man. - Look, she got more heart than most. I give her that, I give her that. That still don't mean we could trust her, Fresh. That still don't mean she won't tell, Fresh. - Listen, man. One thing is for sure is I'm not fucking with Lady no more, man. And we definitely gonna need a new hook, man. - And you're thinking about replacing Lady with a chick that can get us a one way ticket to Riker's on a murder charge and robbery charge? Fuck that! I'll pass. - I ain't say we replacing Lady with her, man. - You ain't gotta say it, Fresh. I see the wheels in your head turning. Look, we don't know this chick like that. We don't know if she can handle what we into. - You're right. But there's one way to find out. [hip hop music] ♪ It feels iffy, I'm pervin ♪ I don't like being nervous ♪ Funny vibes all on this - Girl, we gotta get to this money all fucking winter. - Cheers to that. - All work, no play. - I'm definitely with it. [door shutting] This drink is not bad. I'ma go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. - What's up, Porsha? - Man, fuck, I didn't see, I'm out. - No-- - Get the fuck off of me, I said. We ain't in that hallway, I ain't outnumbered. - Listen, my fault, I understand, but I'm here to talk, man. - [Porsha] What you wanna talk about? - About starting over, Porsha. I'm Fresh. - Porsha. - [Fresh] Nice to meet you. Can I get your shots on? - Go for it. - [Waitress] Can I get you something? - Extra shots please. - Sure. - Hear me out, Porsha, my fault. I understand man, streets is crazy though. I didn't know if you was trying to set me up to some shit. - What made you have a change of heart? - I asked around about you. - [Porsha] And what'd your nosy ass find out? - That your name Porsha Garcia, nigga saying you're a real one. And you a hustler at heart. - I told you that shit the other day. - Yeah you did. But snitches and cops say the same shit and it's just that convincing. Not always as pretty, but just as convincing. - [Waitress] Enjoy. - So you're a real one, huh? - [Porsha] All that, I've been in these streets since I was a little girl. - Can you handle a gun real well? - Did it look like I couldn't handle a gun? Did it look like I couldn't handle a gun in that hallway? - Put your number in. I'll be in touch, man. - [Man On Radio] We know her business. - Copy, run 'em.

Taken by Bullard to score! - What's up, bro? - You didn't tell her, did you? - You know, bro. I was really thinking this could work out with two broads, bro. I think so man, it could happen. - No, man. No is no. - Yo, I know Lady botched that last job but she's loyal. We don't know nothing about Porsha. - Listen, man. I told you I'm not dealing with her. She almost got me killed, man. - So you're making decisions for all of us now? - Cash agreed, it's majority rules, man. [sighing] Lady, let me holler at you. - Yo, I'm telling you, sun is nice. - He aigh't. - What? He just made five in a row. Watch him make this next shot. - We'll see. - I got a stack on it. - Go ahead. - Ugh! - We no longer need your services, Ma. - What do you mean? - I mean you out the crew. - Look. I know I fucked up last time, all right? I messed up. You know, but come on. - Listen, you out, end of discussion, man. - You knew about this? - Go home, Lady. Go home, we'll talk later, go. Just go home, Lady. - No. Hell motherfucking no. This is the weak ass bitch y'all niggas replacing me with? This prissy ass bitch?

Chill, man, chill out, man. - [Porsha] Get off of me, get off of me! - Chill, man, chill. - [Lady] You fucking bitch! - [Porsha] Shut the fuck up. - [Lady] Get the fuck off me. [gun clacking] - What now, huh? Who's the prissy bitch now, huh? - Yo, Fresh, look what's she doing, man! - This shit would have never happened if you'd told her she was out of the crew, man. - Now you listen to me, okay? The next time you disrespect me, I'ma pull this trigger. But I'ma let you go back to living your pathetic little life after you apologize to me. Now say sorry. Say sorry, I'ma pull this motherfucking trigger! - I'm sorry. - I can't hear you. I need it to be a little louder. I need you to say "Porsha, I'm sorry "for disrespecting you." - Porsha, I'm sorry for disrespecting you. - Good girl. Now you can go back to living a simple minded ass out of here. - It's not over. - [Porsha] Walk out of here, bitch. [car horns honking] - Porsha called me an hour ago man, tomorrow night we go in. You good with that? - Yeah bro. - Why I ain't convinced, man? - What you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. - I said I'm good, bro. - Get the shit off your chest, nigga. - Yo, that shit that bitch did was foul. - Bone, Lady stepped to her first, man. - Nah, bro. She went way beyond defending herself. She crossed boundaries! - What she did was no different than what me and you did when we was on island, man. If a nigga steps us, we cut his face so fucking bad, he and everybody else watching knew not to fuck with us, man. - [banging] This ain't the island, Fresh! This ain't the yard! She went too far. She even pointed a gun at me and I don't go for that! Who's to say she won't go too far on the job? We don't know nothing about this broad. - Listen, Bone. Would we be having this conversation if it wasn't your bitch who fucked up? - Her being my bitch ain't got nothing to do with this! - It has everything to fucking do with it, man. Honestly speaking, man. Do you think Lady would have passed that test we put Porsha through, man? You saw how damn shook she got after I murdered Goldie! This is real talk, nigga, do you? - I don't know and we won't know. Now I understand why you had to cut her crew from the loose. [sighing] I just don't trust this bitch, I just don't. - The fuck you keep looking at me like that for, Bone? - You fucked her? - What? - You heard me. You fucked her? - Hell no I ain't fuck her. Listen Bone, Porsha's in the crew, she ain't going nowhere. Bitch like that is too valuable to what we got going on. You're gonna have to get used to it. - And if I don't? What, her over me? I'm expendable? - You talking stupid, Bone. - I am? - Yeah. Listen, hear me out, Bone. We've been brothers since we was kids. And you know I don't trust nobody to watch my back besides you and Cash. Trust y'all niggas with my life. - Same here, bro. We've been through some shit! [sighing] That's why I'm telling you you need to think about this. 'Cause there's gonna come a time when you got to choose between us or her. And son telling me that because that bitch is not gonna be an easy decision for you. - [Fresh] All right Bone, I'm outta here. I gotta go see Tommy. [sighing] [creaking] - Didn't I tell you what I would do to you the next time you showed your face here? - How many times I gotta tell you Tommy, that shit wasn't my fault. - I don't give a fuck. The cops came here asking questions because of your fuckup. That makes you bad for business, Fresh. - Hear me out, Tommy. You're the best in the business, a business I respect. But that fuckup cost me 10 years of my life. I did my time like a man. Streets miss Fresh. Come on, Tommy. - What do you need? - Five guns with silencers. Automatics with steady clips. - I hope you got extended cash. This package is gonna run you seven grand. - Goddamn, Tommy, seven grand? You're robbing me, man. - That's tax for your fuckup. Take it or leave it or risk guns with bodies on them that don't work properly. Money up front as usual. - I'll have someone drop you the money tomorrow, man. - Fresh, when I look at you I see a smart and resourceful marksman. A throwback from my day. Don't let the carelessness be your downfall. And one more thing, Fresh. If the cops come back here asking questions, the streets will be missing Fresh for a different reason. - You done?

You just mad your bitch couldn't hold it down like Porsha could. Get out your motherfucking feelings, nigga. - I don't trust that bitch. She's gonna be the downfall of this crew, Fresh, I can feel it! - She took a bitch's head off tonight, nigga. What more proof you need than that, motherfucker? - That don't mean nothing. I still don't trust her. Yo, I can't do this, bro. I'm out, man, I can't do this. - Bone, where the fuck you going? Bone! Bone, where you goin?! - [Fresh] Let him get the fuck on, man. - Chill, bro. The crew can't keep going on like this, man. We're self-destructing! - Yo, ditch the car, man. We'll break bread in the morning. - [Cash] Fuck! [water splashing] - [Fresh] You all right? - Yeah. - First one, huh? First person you ever killed? - [Porsha] Yeah. - Murder's harsh but it has to be done in this game we're in. If we had let them niggas survive they would have came back, found out where your mother lives or anybody close to you and chopped off all ten of they fingers just for revenge. - How old were you when you had your first kill? - Real young. I was 12 years old. - Why'd you do it? - I was protecting my mother. My mother was one of them type of women who would accept being punched on. I was one of them type of kids who couldn't accept it. She was a addict. One night her and her boyfriend were getting high and began arguing that she smokes too much of the shit they went on together. He punched her. He punched her so hard she fell and bust her head open at the table. Blood was pouring from her head. I was angry and scared at the same time. I didn't know what else to do but go to her room, go inside her drawer and grab the gun. When I came back out, he saw me and charged. And I squeezed the trigger. From what the doctors say, nigga was dead before he hit the floor. I'm not proud of it. - Me and you are more alike than you know. - What you mean?

We're live here in East Harlem where there's a string of robberies. We have no suspects or witnesses at the moment. Excuse me sir, do you mind if I ask you a question about the recent crime in your area and how do you feel about it? - Yes. I feel that it's really disturbing because we have all these police. We got a police station not too far from here. And for all these robberies and these crimes to be going on in this area, it's been gentrified. And majority of the people around here, it should be more policing, more people for this community outreach about all the robberies that's happening. And it hurts me 'cause I gotta pick my wife up at night and walk my son. And he's 12 years old. And it's kind of bad. - Okay. Well thank you for tuning in and stay tuned, we'll be right back. [knocking] - Can I help you? - I'm here to see Joey. - And you are? - Tell him it's Gino. - Gino? Yeah, Joey, you have somebody here named Gino to see you. All right, I'll send him down. You can go down. - Gino, my longtime friend. To what do I owe this honor? - Joey. Oh man. Joey, you heard what they did. The fucking cocksuckers, they killed my fucking partner. They fucking shot his fucking brains out. Fucking Angie. Fucking Angie! I saw her on the fucking floor dead. I'm gonna deal with that. But right now I'm not here for that. I got 50 bricks coming in in two weeks. Double Dragon straight from China. What I need from you, I need you to give me 10 bricks to hold me off for the next two weeks. In return, I'll give you 12 bricks as a way of me saying thank you for this gesture. Please, I really need this. Can you help me? - Gino, were you followed? - [Gino] I was not followed. - You sure? - [Gino] I'm positive, I was not followed. - Gino, forget about the bricks. You know what I want from you? I want you to get these fucking cocksuckers, okay? - On my mother's grave, they're fucking dead, dead, dead! You got my word! - Thank you. 'Cause I don't need that shit in my fucking neighborhood. - [Gino] They're fucking dead, don't worry about it. [phone ringing] - Yo, what up? - Yo Fresh. Think I got something for you, big boy. - Talk to me. - I just seen Gino. He in a beauty shop. He come out [mumbling] but I think you can find out.

I gotta think of something bigger than this. - So what's the plan, what you wanna do? - I haven't really thought about it but maybe, I don't know, some stocks. Maybe flipping some property.

You leave the crew hanging on a job, come back a week later, talking about what mood you in? Who you think you are, man? - Fresh, I made a mistake, I'm human. - And you know how I feel about mistakes in this line of work, man. - Fresh, come on. - Listen, man. I fought my nigga to keep you in this crew. The nigga who got my back since the sandbox. I did that shit 'cause I thought you was worth it, man. - Oh so me rocking Don V's bitch to sleep isn't enough to hold down my position? - Hell no. There's more to being part of this crew than just squeezing triggers, man. - Oh yeah, like what? - Loyalty, we don't run out on each other, man. - I didn't run out! - The hell you didn't. You knew we had a job to do. Instead of being here to hold down your part you chose to run off to Atlanta. - How'd you know I was in Atlanta? - Listen man, it doesn't matter how I know. What matters is you weren't here when we needed you, man. - Fresh, I'm sorry. That Don V job, that messed me up. That sliced open body, rocking his bitch to sleep, that shit messed with my head. I've been seeing that in my dreams. I needed to get away. I needed to clear my head. And of course what me and you did the other day. - So what happens the next time you gotta body another motherfucker? The next time you see too much blood, you gonna run out on us again like a coward, man? - Come on, Fresh. - I can't keep putting my crew in jeopardy over you, man. I can't keep taking chances on you, man. First you bailed out on me when me and you had an altercation, then you bailed on the entire crew, man. I can't keep doing it , man. Fuck away from my door. [knocking] - Yo, what up, ma? - Yo, what's good? Where's Miguel at? - He in the back. But why you knocking on the door like you're the po-po or something? - Man, you know-- - I look like some type of illiterate nigga to you or something? - He knows I'm coming. Damn, what the fuck, where's he at? Is he here, is he not? - Yo, Miguel! - [Miguel] Yeah. - Porsha out here, yo. - [Miguel] Let her in. - He in the back. - So you come to do business with papi again, huh? After our slight misunderstanding I thought I lost a valued customer. - Man, that shit you pulled on me last week, that shit was mad wack. I expect you to do better this time. - I'm a honest drug dealer. Why'd I purposely sell you some bullshit? This package I got is puro. - Aight, I hope so for your sake. Where's it at? - You got my money? - Yeah. - When you told me your money was low I thought you was gonna offer me some pussy for a package. I better package that pussy tidy nice.

How are you doing today, Ms. Watkins? - Good, how are you? - I'm good, thank you. Now can you share a little bit of what happened here? Did you see anything, hear anything? - I didn't see anything but I heard gunshots from my apartment. It was pretty scary, it was in succession. - Okay, is there anything else you wanna add here before we wrap this story up? - See that? - Just that it's shocking because it's a very quiet building. I've been here for 45 years and we've never had a problem. Everyone pretty much knows one another, you know your neighbor so it's kind of alarming. - Okay well I'm really sorry you guys are experiencing this. Make sure you guys stay tuned to Deja Vu TV. We'll be bringing you the latest update. [splashing] [knocking] - Hold on a minute. Who is it? - [Man] Hello ma'am, it's the police. - [Ms. Watkins] The police? Hold on please. Give me just a minute. Just a sec. Hi. - [Man] How you doing ma'am? - [Man] Hello. - [Man] I'm Detective Lewis. This is my partner Detective Schwartz. You mind if we come in and ask you a few questions? - Yes, can I see your badges? Thank you, hold on one second. Come right in, officers. You can have a seat over there. - Hey, Ms. Watkins. - Thanks, Ma'am. - How can I help you? - So, Ms. Watkins. Do you know why we're here? - [Ms. Watkins] I think I have an idea. You two have a seat. - Okay keep going. We just have a couple quick questions for you. - Okay. - There was a shooting last night. I don't know if you were up or you were at home when the shooting was going on but we're just trying to find out maybe if you've seen something or heard anything, anything you might be able to tell us that might help our case. - As a matter of fact, I did. - Did you see anyone fleeing the scene or leaving from anywhere? Anything you might be able to tell us that can help? - Oh I saw a young lady leaving one of the apartments. - [Detective Lewis] About how tall would you say she was? - Between 5'4 or 5'5. - [Detective Lewis] Okay, black, white, Spanish? - She was either Hispanic of African-American. - Can you tell me what this young lady was wearing? - She had on a black hoodie and some gray stretch pants. - Was she alone? - Yes she was alone because I remember she was carrying this rather heavy bag. And it was difficult for her to carry. - Okay. Ms. Watkins, would you happen to know a Manny or Miguel? - Miguel is my neighbor. - Okay, anything you could tell me about Miguel? - He's rather respectful, nice young man. I just notice that he has a lot of people coming and going at all hours of the night from his apartment. - How long have you known Miguel? - I've known him for a long time. I've lived here all my life. - So you know everything. - Yeah, you know sometimes I'm up at night pacing the floor, reading my bible and I happen to look through the peephole and you see a lot going on. I just wanna be safe. - These your children? - Yes, my children and my grandchildren. - I see she just graduated. - Yes she did. The first one of the grandchildren to graduate. - All right Ms. Watkins, we thank you for your time and your cooperation. You've been very helpful. - Thank you officers, anything I can do to help. - If there's anything you think of, you can reach us here. - Thank you so much, officer. - Don't be afraid to use the phone. - I won't. - Thank you, appreciate it. - Thank you for your help. - [Detective Lewis] You have a good night, Ms. Watkins. - [Ms. Watkins] You too, thank you officers. I feel safe just knowing you're all around. - You got a nice apartment too. - [Ms. Watkins] Thank you. I've lived here all my life. - Can I have a apple? - No, that's for my kids. - You got a lighter? - No, I don't have one, partner. - I will offer you one. But to be honest, I just don't want to. - Man, what am I in here for? - First of all, you got me confused with a person that likes misconception. I'm not that person. Misconception confuse things. They slow down the process. For an example, you have a misconception how this interview is supposed to start. You think you gonna be running shit and you gonna ask the questions. It's not gonna happen. It's gonna start by you telling us where the gun is. - What gun? - The gun our officer saw you coming down the staircase with. - The gun that we know that you used to murder Manny and Miguel. [speaks in foreign language] Don't get stupid. - Better listen to him. - This is double homicide, sweetheart. [speaks in foreign language] You're famous now! You in the big leagues! - Man, I don't know nothing about no murder. I don't know shit. - But you know Miguel Lopez, don't you? - Just 'cause I know a motherfucker don't mean I killed him. - But how do you know him? - He's a friend. - What kind of friend? - A friend, that's it. - No, Miss Garcia. He's not just a friend. He's your plug. In fact, I know he was! I bet my pension on it. - I don't know nothing about no gun or nothing. - [Detective Lewis] Really? So this friend, this so-called friend, when was the last time you saw your "friend"? - It's been a while. - [Detective Lewis] What's a while? - A while. That's it. - I need to know days. I need to know months! I need to know weeks! [banging] - A couple weeks, I don't know. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah, hell yeah, I'm sure. - She playing games, man. - So you're saying you didn't see him tonight? - Nope. - So you're saying you didn't speak to him at any time today? - No! - So what the fuck you was doing in that building? - Visiting a friend. - What's your friend's name? - Deja. - And what's your friend's apartment number? - 304. Man look, I wish I could help y'all find whoever did this, but, I can't, I don't know what happened. - Mmm, she don't know what happened. - No. - You're cute. You're really cute. - You know what else is cute, man? You know them big burly bitches down the road, they like cute ones like her. You know what else they like to do? They like to pass your pussy around for the ramen noodles and cigarettes. Yeah, that's what they like to do. - [Detective Schwartz] Exactly. - Look, I don't know shit. - [Detective Lewis] Yeah. - You don't know huh? - Man, look, I don't know anything, all right? And I'm done talking to you. I want my lawyer. - [Detective Lewis] Right. - No problem, Miss Garcia. No problem. Shit, if I was charged with double homicide, I would want a lawyer too. - [Detective Lewis] Hell yeah. - In fact, to be honest, that's the smartest decision that your dumb ass made all night. Oh, for the record, Miss Garcia, you're gonna love this one. We know that you spoke to Miguel today. 'Cause the incoming call on his cellphone would show that. We also know that you shot him tonight. 'Cause the gunpowder [speaks in foreign language] in your hands, will also prove that. Even if! Even if my officers can't find the gun that you tossed tonight, we got something just as good. - [chuckling] Sure do. We got a witness. - [speaks in foreign language] bad. You fucked up. You fucked up bad. Real bad. - [Guard] Come on, come on. [clacking] - Same shit again? - Come on ladies, hurry up. Let's move this line. Let's go, let's go, let's go. - Really? - Yo, I heard you got a new bunkie? - Oh shit, are you serious? Where is she? - That's what it is. - Then stop coming back. Hey, you got a extra hotdog, you're eating for two. - [Inmate] Oh yeah. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Can I get another juice? - No. - [Guard] Just grab your tray and let's move it. - Dog food look better than this shit. - What's wrong with you? Had a bad day? - Nothing, what's wrong with you? No. - Here, get your cup. - Thank you. - Come on, let's move this line, let's move the line, let's go, ladies. - Here we go again. Is this ever gonna end? - I don't know baby. Maybe you should stop coming back to prison. - Can I get two of those? - Two of what? - Hotdogs. - You ain't on, you ain't pregnant. - Oh I gotta be pregnant? - Yeah. - Yeah yeah. - You on a special diet. Jeez, I tell you. - Who the fuck are you? - Well, what's your name? - Why, you don't know me and I don't know you. - Look, I don't want any problems, okay? I'm just asking your name, that's all. - I don't know you. - Well I heard that the two of us are gonna be sharing a cell. So I just thought that it would be like a good idea for us to know each other's names. I mean it would keep the tensions down between me and you and around here a little. So instead of us you know, walking around like, hey you. No, okay, so. What's your name? My name is Angel. - Porsha. - Is that your real name? - That's the name my mother gave me. - You ever asked her like why she named you that? - Never really got a chance to. She died when I was nine. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that but I feel you. Mines died when I was only six. So like what are you in for? - Murder. - Who did you kill? - Nobody. - Oh. I'm in for the same thing. The only difference is I actually did it. - Who'd you, I mean why'd you kill him? - He raped me. Yeah, it's his baby if that's what you're wondering. - Are you serious? - As a heart attack. It's just, well, the first time though was like the last time that I actually had the courage to do something about it. He raped me so many times throughout the years, I couldn't even keep track. - [Porsha] How old are you? - I'm 18. [tense music] So like, Porsha, do you play spades? - Nah, I'm good. - Oh, well. I'll holla at you later then. Bye. - [Guard] Come on ladies, let's eat up, let's eat up. [tense music] - [Woman] Here we go again. - No problems out of you on your visit. I guarantee this will be the fastest visit you ever had. - Hey boo. How you doin? What's going on, how you holding up? - It's a process, girl, but I'm doing it. You know ain't no walls or barbed wire fence is gonna break me and hold me back. - I know that's right. You whoop anybody's ass yet 'cause I know how you are. - Nah, girl, I stick to myself. If they don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with them. I ain't really trying to get to know none of these bitches in here. - I feel you. You see anybody we know up here? - Nah. For the most part I stay in my cell. I'm not really trying to make friends or see friends, nothing. - Yeah. That's the only way to be. Just stick to yourself. - It's the only way to be. - But overall we're missing you out there. How you feeling? - I just miss my freedom. - I'm sure you're missing some dick too. [laughing] Girl, we're gonna throw you the only party when you get home. I can't wait. We turning up. - [Guard] Silk, quiet down now. - I can't wait my damn self, shit. This shit is for the birds. - I know that's right. Porsha, you sure you're okay? - Yeah I just miss the streets like crazy sometimes. - I know, you're gonna be out of here soon. Soon enough. So how's the case going? What the lawyers talking about? - I mean it's just, I really won't know anything until my first preliminary hearing. And that could take months. - Yeah. Have you been speaking to anyone yet? - Yeah, she can't really tell me nothing new right now because I'm not taking no plea bargain and she just told me be prepared for trial. - I feel you. - Yo, speaking of my lawyer. - [Silk] What's up? - I need you to do me a favor. The day I got caught by the cops, I stashed a bag full of money and bricks behind that alley at 305. I need you to go get that and hit my lawyer off for like a hundred grand, all right? I ain't fucking with no public defender, fuck that. Then the rest of the money I need you to put it in the bank. - Okay. I got you. What about the bricks though? - Get with 2Gs, put that shit up, bag it up, hit the crew off. Just 'cause I'm locked up don't mean we can't get money while I'm in here. - I know that's right, I feel you. - I really need you, Silk. You're all I got while I'm in here. I really need you to come through for me. - Porsha, I got you. - Now Silk, time almost up. - Hey, I need you. - Just trust me. I got you. - All right. - [Silk] Can I say bye to my friend? [inmates chattering in distance] - Hey! I didn't see you at chow today. I brought you something. You look like a cooked corned beef Reuben type of girl. - Girl, I cannot eat that stuff at chow. - I completely understand. That's why I got my job in the kitchen though 'cause I was like that the first two weeks I got here. But you know, I am eating for two, so, that's why I could eat what I want whenever I want in that kitchen. - Yeah. Can I ask you something? - [Angel] Sure, go ahead. - What are you gonna do when the baby's born? I mean, what if you get a lot of time in here? [sighing] - I'm young but I'm not naive. I know that as soon as I have this baby they're gonna take it away from me. I'm just trying to enjoy motherhood right now for as long as I can. It's just the only thing that's keeping my mind off the fact that I'm probably gonna be in here for the rest of my life. - Don't say that. - [Angel] It's the truth. - It's gonna be okay, I promise. - [Angel] Okay. I'll believe you for now. - All right, bye. - Come on Silk, pick up. I've been calling for two fucking weeks. - We're waiting for that phone. - Yeah wait your turn, wait your turn. - Oh my god. - Let's get that phone going. - [Guard] Come on five minutes, let's go. - [Inmate] Let's go. I got a call to make, it's urgent. - [Guard] Wait your turn. - Pick up the fucking phone, Silk, come on, I'm calling for two fucking weeks. - Come on, man. - Come on, if you can't get through, let's move it. - Money, baby. - Ugh, you backstabbing bitch. - Chill, man, you're gonna break the damn phone! What the hell's wrong with you? - [Guard] Let's go, let's go. - Damn yo. - Just make your phone call, let's go. One more incident like that, you're gonna be in the box. All right, come on, let's go, let's go. You make your phone call after the count. - Why, she took all my time. - Because I said so, after the count, let's go. - [Porsha] What the fuck you want, bitch? - You know what the fuck I want, bitch. I've been waiting for this moment so long my tits is hard. - Man, fuck you, bitch. [bashing] - [Lady] Don't talk that shit to me. - [Angel] Get the fuck off her! [screaming] [bashing] - [Porsha] Leave her alone! Get off of her! [screaming] [bashing] - Like I told you before, bitch. I've been waiting for this moment a long time, bitch. Hope you enjoy it as much as I'm about to. [screaming] Shut up, you stupid bitch. [somber music] - Oh, Angel, Angel. Angel! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, CO, somebody help me! Oh my god I'm so sorry! Somebody come help me! Where's the CO? I'm so sorry. I can't believe this. Oh my god Angel I'm so sorry. Somebody help! Somebody help! - Code red, code red. 10-1, cell five. [Porsha sobbing] - [Guard] What's going on, what's going on? Who was it? Who did this? Who did this? Is she okay? Back up, miss. Back up. Is she breathing? - [Bald Guard] Paramedic, paramedic. 10-1, cell five. 10-1 cell five. - [Guard] She's not breathing. - Everybody out ,everybody out. Take her out of here, get her out of here. Hey. What happened in Porsha's cell the other day? - [Inmate] I don't know what you're talking about. - I know you seen what happened. - No I didn't. - If you're lying to me, I'ma give you 20 days in the box. - But I didn't see anything. - [Guard] Go ahead. - Oh my god, you two, what just happened? - What happened? - Oh my god I just saw her get punched in the face. - Who? - No way. Oh my god. - Who did that? - [Inmate] Oh shit! - It was Lady! - [Inmate] For real? - Yeah it was Lady, I don't know. She will break my nose. - Why? - It was scary, it was scary. - Oh, is she badly cut? - I don't know. Well yeah, I mean lots of blood. - Wow. - Yeah, oh my god. - [Inmate] Where is she? You know where she's gone now? - I don't know, she must be in the hospital. - Hey Lady, how you doing? - Hi, CO, how are you? Why do you ask? - I heard what you did. - What'd I do? - To Miss Garcia and Angel. - Oh yeah? I don't know what you're talking about. - Turn around. Let's go. You think I'm playing, let's go. - It's not what you heard, CO, it's what you can prove. - Oh I could prove a lot. - Yeah? - Yes. Prove a mighty lot. Let's go. [speaks in foreign language] [somber music] [sobbing] [banging] - Hey, you're just in time man, games on halftime right now. What's up man, what's going on? - What's up, Fresh? I gotta holla at you up this time, bro. - [Fresh] What's up, talk to me, what's going on? - Yo when was the last time you heard from that broad Porsha? - Man you know I don't fuck with that broad. Not after she left us hanging on that job, man. - Facts. I feel you on that. - [Fresh] Well, what's up then? - I just came from the safe from visiting Lady. - State? Thought she was on Riker's man. - Nah man, she got transferred on a murder charge. - Murder charge? - Her and her girls were boosting. Stomped out some pregnant lady. They killed her and the baby. - Dang. - Yeah. But that's not all though. - Sure. - Lady was telling about some chick she cut up on the Island. - Word? Lady up in that motherfucker wilding like that? - Yeah man. - I didn't think she had it in her to get down like that, man. - I heard the girl she cut up was Porsha. [tense music] - What? - Yeah. Listen, man. Me and Porsha never got along but I would never wish no harm on nobody like that. And I don't know how bad she got cut up though. But I just thought I had to tell you. You all right, bro? - Good, man. - Sure? - [Fresh] Yeah. - All right, man. Just had to drop that news on you bro.

What exactly did the witness see? - [Porsha] What do you want, Fresh? - I came here to see you, Porsha. - All right, you've seen me. I look like a circus freak. - Porsha.

Matter of fact, I'ma get there early to make sure I don't miss nothing. - I figured that. - Tada. - [Ms. Watkins] My family? My family don't have nothing to do with this. - The fuck they don't. They got everything to do with it that I say they do. - What do you want me to do? - Something simple. Tell the prosecutor on court that the woman on trial is not the same woman you saw entering and leaving the building the night of the murder. You don't testify and no harm comes your way. If you do testify, me and my disrespectful heathens here will make sure they die very slow deaths. - [Ms. Watkins] Oh my god. - It's all up to you. - [Cash] Be smart. - What's it gonna be? - Okay, okay. I won't testify. - [Fresh] [clapping] Good girl. [ominous music] [cars honking] - All rise. The Supreme Court of New York's Criminal Division System is now in session with presiding Judge Crawford. - [Judge Crawford] You may be seated. Bailiff Spooner, please swear in the jury. - Raise your right hand. Do each of you swear you will fairly try this case before the court, that you will return a true verdict according to the evidence and the instructions of the court, so help you God? If so, say I do. - [Jury] I do. - You may be seated. Your honor, today's case is the State of New York versus Porsha Garcia. - Members of the jury, your duty today will be to determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty by the facts and the evidence presented in this case. Is the prosecution ready? - Yes your honor. - [Judge Crawford] Be seated. Is the defense ready? - Yes, your honor. - [Judge Crawford] Be seated. - Your honor, members of the jury, we're here today because on September 8th, 2019, Porsha Garcia took a handgun and two intentional shots that killed Miguel Lopez and Manny Rodriguez. Prosecution will prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that Miss Garcia is guilty of murder in the first degree. The State of New York wishes to provide justice and closure to the Lopez and Rodriguez families. We are confident that the weight of evidence we intend to present throughout the course of this trial will render the defendant guilty. - Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, under the State law, my client Porsha Garcia is innocent until proven guilty. She stands here before you falsely accused of first degree murder and a double homicide. That is a very serious matter. The State of New York wants justice and we want justice too. But for the right person. At the end of the trial all we ask is that you render the right verdict, not guilty. Thank you. - Prosecution, you may call your first witness. - The people call Ms. Watkins to the stand. [tense music] - Raise your right hand. Do you promise the testimony that you're giving the court today is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God? - Miss Watkins. If you refuse to swear in, you will be found in contempt. - Your honor, may we have five minutes in your chambers please? - Ms. Watkins? - [Ms. Watkins] Yes, your honor? - If you refuse to testify, I have no choice. I have to subpoena you. You're wasting my time, you're wasting the court's time, make a choice. - Your honor, I'm afraid. - [Judge Crawford] Of who? - I'd rather not say, your honor. - Ms. Watkins, I cannot help you unless you tell me who you're afraid of. - Your honor, if you need to subpoena me, I understand but can you protect my family? - I cannot protect your family if I don't know who I'm protecting you from! - There's a lot at stake your honor, my family's in danger. I don't feel comfortable saying. - [Judge Crawford] Ms. Watkins, make a choice. - Your honor, may I go now? - Please go. - Ma'am, you gots to be kidding me. After two whole weeks of sitting at that deliberation table you're gonna tell me Miss Porsha Garcia is not guilty 'cause she's a woman? - No. That's not what I'm saying, sir. What I'm saying is just because she was at the scene of the crime, that doesn't mean she committed the murder. It's a tenement. There were hundreds of people there. - There were a ton of people there. - Right. - How can it be only her? - Come on now. The cops said they seen her and she ran from them. And why would she run if she wasn't guilty? - I could think of plenty reasons why she would run. One, she was scared. - She was scared, she could have been nervous. - [Man] Wouldn't you run if you saw a cop? - Why is she scared and nervous if she's not guilty? - Ever met a cop you could trust? - There's not a high level of trust for police officers in that community, right? - Does she have any priors? - Priors or no priors, guilty is guilty. There was a gun on the scene. - Where's the evidence? - Now I hear you. But I also heard three cops say the same exact thing. - Three cops? - Yeah, three. - Were they male? Were they female? Were they biased? Were there any witnesses? - They say they've seen Miss Porsha Garcia with a gun in her hand. And she ran from them. Now coming from where I come from, a gun plus a run, that equals guilty. - And coming from where I come from, you can't trust the cops. There's no evidence, real evidence. She didn't get caught with the gun. There's no real witness. It's just three cops saying the same thing. - Look. I think we just need to keep track of the information that was presented for the case, right? Let's not make any assumptions. There's no gun, right? No clear evidence connecting Miss Garcia with actually the crime, so I say she's not guilty. - [Woman] There's no witnesses. - I think we don't know enough. [slamming] - Will the jury foreperson please stand? Has the jury reached a verdict? - Yes we have, your honor. - [Judge Crawford] Will the defendant please rise? Read the verdict. - We the jury of the State of New York versus Porsha Garcia finds the defendant not guilty. - [Porsha] Oh my god, yes! - [Judge Crawford] Jury, the court thanks you for your time. The defendant is free to go. Court is adjourned. - You did it, baby. - No, you did it. You made this happen.
