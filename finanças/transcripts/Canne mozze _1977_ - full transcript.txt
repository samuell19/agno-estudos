Sawn-off Shotguns Molet? Are you Giovanni Molet's brother? Dad. Come closer. Lorenzo's back. I did what had to be done. Now the Molet's will have learnt their lesson. Molet. Let's go. Have a seat. The lieutenant has come here to talk to you... and he hopes you'll co-operate. Your brother was killed the same way you killed the Carraro brothers. So this series of killings between your families continues. You know who it was, everyone knows... but there's no proof, we need someone like you. Don't you want to avenge your brother? He wants to be the one. He's like a wounded animal. The only thing he feels is pain, anger, hate. He's only thinking of one thing, to settle the score with Carraro... spilling more blood, he's just waiting for a chance to avenge his brother. Only then will he be convinced he's saved the family honour. You'll be transferred to another penitentiary tomorrow... where you will remain under the jurisdiction of that city. Sooner or later, with or without you, we'll arrest Carraro... and then it will be the law that delivers justice. And we'll put an end to these vendettas. Your brother was just a kid... and it's also your fault he died, don't forget that. That lieutenant was there as well. I understand. I've had enough, I'm going to work for a private company. Who's that over there? The coast guard. They've got it easy. All year at sea. It's the coast guard. - You look like smugglers! - Funny! - Who's he? - Giovanni Molet, prisoner transfer. Keep him, we've got enough here! - What time is it? - 9:30 - When's this train coming? - Soon. - I didn't say it had arrived. - Yes, but I need to pee. Go on. - Has the train already been? - No. - What has that poor guy done? - Him? He's a killer. - He's in for life. - Life? He has to stay in prison for the rest of his life. Are you a foreigner? - American? - Yes. Hurry up. Come on, spread out. Over here. Lieutenant, I've found Molet. Okay, bring him here. Now a report on the dramatic escape of Giovanni Molet. Accused of the murders of brothers Salvatore and Francesco Carraro. who were killed in a land feud... Giovanni Molet, who you can see in the photo... has added another victim to his tragic story. Officer Santino Lamana, 25, who leaves behind a wife and a child. Shot twice, he died on the way to hospital. Another officer who was wounded in the neck... has been operated on, and the doctors hope to save him... provided his condition doesn't worsen. Roadblocks have been set up throughout the area. Patrols are combing the countryside with the assistance of dog units... but so far, Giovanni Molet has escaped capture. The minister of the interior is offering a reward of 5 million lira... for the capture of this dangerous bandit. Move it! Who is he? I'm scared! What if someone sees you? They're looking everywhere for you. Turn right, it's safer. I'll take you to my place, it isn't far. Looks like I've caused a lot of trouble. It's chaos out there. - I need your husband? - We split up a while ago. I couldn't live with Antonio anymore, he was impossible. But if you need him, I know where to find him. Antonio's number is there, near the phone. He works for a mechanic not far from here. Listen, what happened to your brother? They arrested him last year, some pig ratted on him. Is your husband still in contact with Lodeo? Yes, I know they're dealing in cigarettes now. Who the hell is this? Antonio, it's me, can you talk? I read the papers, I was expecting you. - You know where I need to go. - Where are you? - I'm with Carla. - Okay, just stay there. I know what to do, give me a couple of hours and I'll be with you. Listen... Hello? - Try to get some rest. - Okay. Antonio's here, and he isn't alone. - Who's with him? - A cop, I've seen him before. - Who is it? - It's me, Antonio. - Where's Giovanni Molet hiding? - Who's this Molet? - You know perfectly well. - Look, my client left an hour ago. - Search the house. - Go ahead, he's gone. Looked like he was in a hurry. - Why are you protecting him? - Protecting who? Giovanni Molet. You know I always co-operate, I'm not like that asshole husband of mine. And if I tell you he's an asshole, you can believe it. - There's no one here. - Come with us. What for? Move it. Dirty pervert. Listen, time is money, who's going to pay me? - Does Lodeo still work with trucks? - Yes. What are you doing? - Listen, how long till we arrive? - A little longer. I'll leave you at the bridge. It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful, someone might see. I don't want any trouble. I still don't feel safe. The matches, please. Your task is to watch this house. He'll come to us. Maybe not, the cops might get to him before he makes it here. He can't escape, they're hunting him like an animal. This is his land, he knows it like the back of his hand. - It will be hard to find him. - He might slip up. If he's crazy enough to come, then too bad for him. - Good evening, lieutenant. - Have a seat. A message from headquarters, Molet has escaped again. - He must heading here. - There are roadblocks everywhere. He's arrived. - You can be sure of it. - How do you know? You can feel it in the air when the wolf is close, the sheep smell it... - they start to bleet, and they hide. - And Carraro? They haven't moved from their house all day. And since this morning they've had two armed guards by the gate. - What else? - There's rumour of a new delivery. Let's get a team together. Quick, call headquarters. And you can go. And be careful. Don't worry, I'm not stupid. Not bad. Not bad at all. So this is the little house your father gave you for your wedding. For our wedding. It's one of the advantages of being an only child. - I didn't realise it was so big. - My father exaggerates with everything. There's no power, wait here. - God damn, now I get it. - What? - Why you had so many admirers. - There weren't that many. Besides, I didn't like them. - They were just gold diggers. - Sure, but I always noticed in time. Right? - But you didn't leave me. - Of course, you're different. - You're not like them. - You know why? Why? I love you. It feels damp, open the windows. We'll be happy here, you'll see. We'll throw some great parties. Fantastic, I like everything here. - How much land do you have? - A lot! You know what? I'll buy some colts and breed race horses. Do what you want, but I'm getting some sun. Michele. Where are you? - You frightened me. - What? Who did you think it was? Some lover I'd forgotten about under the bed. I'll show you a lover! Stay calm and quiet, and nothing bad will happen to you. Get up! Don't try anything! In the house! Get inside, move it! What do you want? Who are you? Do you want money? Put it down. Take it. Coward! Thug! What do you want from us? - Get the car keys. - I'm not moving, take them! You're an animal! - Get the keys. - No, I'm not going. This is my house, I'm not taking orders from you. - I said the keys. - No, I'm staying here. Take what you want and go! The keys. Please, do as he says. He'll kill me. Go! And get dressed! What do you want from us? We haven't done anything to you. We're on our honeymoon. You must have your reasons for being here, but leave us out of it. Let's try to reach an agreement. If you want money... Take it, take everything. And if you want us to go, we're... We're ready. Stay down. You'll stay here as long as I do. Don't do anything stupid and nothing will happen to you, got it? I know who you are, you're that guy who escaped from prison. You'll keep us here until the police call off the search. - I said get the car keys. - Please, just go. Don't hurt us. That man is very (cut) don't ever forget that. I understand. You're hungry, I guess you haven't eaten in a while? - Make me a coffee. - I'll go. Not you, it isn't a man's job. You. They're scared, nobody wants to go up against Giovanni Molet. They wouldn't tell us even if they knew. - Lodeo is our only lead. - The smuggler? Yes, him. You're looking for a refrigerated truck, understood? - He's still in the area? - Sure. - What else have you got? - Nothing more for now. - It's already a lot. - Let's try to find this smuggler. - We'll set up roadblocks. - In the entire area. We'll also search his workplace. Yes, but be discreet. I don't want any trouble from you. Let go of me! Stay still. You can walk around if you want. Listen to me, please let us go. We won't tell anyone you're hiding here, I swear. You'll be able to move around more freely if you're alone. You can stay here as long as you want. I could kill both of you, I'd have all the time I need. You can't just kill two people for no reason. I'd do it if I was forced to, and I wouldn't hesitate. Be sure of that. If it's money you want, we'll give it to you. You don't get it, I'm not like your kind. Who is it? The gardener, he must have seen the car. - Angelo. - What a lovely surprise! - We arrived yesterday. - Are your parents here as well? - No, I just got married. - Congratulations. Pray she doesn't mess up or I'll blow your brains out! Don't worry. Can I walk around a bit? Just don't go too far. - Where is he? - He's still there with his rifle. It's harder than I thought, but I have to try. Give up, let's try not to do anything foolish. He'll let us go. But we can't stay here waiting for him to kill us. We have to try to escape. Or don't you want to anymore? You've changed since yesterday. You're not afraid anymore. Or has something changed? - What happened? - What on earth are you thinking? You think I haven't noticed how he looks at you? - Do you think I'm that stupid? - What are you talking about? I don't even know myself. He's a strange man. But now I'm sure he won't kill anyone needlessly. We just have to keep cool, and wait. How long? And where? In that dirty cellar? While you sleep with him? Then why don't you kill him? Show me what kind of man I married. You've done nothing but complain. I want to make love, now, here. - What if I don't want to? - Why? Aren't you my wife? Try to win his confidence, it's the only way we'll survive. - They brought two new foals. - The others? - They'll arrive later. - Good, we'll have the best. There's one thing I don't get. How can you last that long in prison without a woman? I couldn't bear the thought of being separated from Silvia. Silvia isn't just beautiful. She's a real woman. I've met a lot of women, but Silvia's different. You probably think I married her for the money... but that's only partly true. I won't deny it played a part. Money is important, but only up to a point. There are other things. Marriages succeed and fail in bed. You know what I like about her? That's your fucking business. Yes, it's true. When was the last time you had a woman? You know you've given me an idea. I might just kill you, then I'll sleep with her. Remove the handcuffs. There's very little to smile about. You'll get at least seven years. You messed up. You should've been happy with your job... but you wanted a slice of the cake and lost out. You're quiet. The cigarettes you were carrying tell us all we need to know. But not you, you're not talking. You're a man of your word. Dumb, but loyal. If you weren't so dumb... you'd have noticed I haven't taken your statement. Come on, talk, for your sake. All I need is a gesture. Did you bring him here? Yes, two days ago. Release him. Now we know for sure that he's in the area. - What about him? - We'll get him next time. - Concentrate the search here. - Yes, sir. Well? Well, what? You know exactly what I mean, don't play dumb. Why? Why don't you do anything? You just stand there, cold. You know what it means if he hasn't touched you? It means he's wary of you. I've seen how he looks at you. He likes you, he wants you. Why don't you encourage him instead of treating him like a fool. You want me to...? Provoke him, excite him. Make him think you want him. I'm your wife, you can't... Whore. It's no use playing the naive wife. Do you think I don't know about you? What you did before you met me... - but I still married you! - Then you did it for my money. That's right, dear, you guessed it. You really thought I loved you? You're nothing without that money. Wait, let's talk... He's rich, he'll pay. I'll contact him, please! Help me. Get up. Bastard, that's why he married me, for my money. I was a fool to believe him. It was all so unbelievable, he treated me like a prostitute. Will you stop that for a moment? Do you really want to kill that man? - Yes. - It's crazy, why do you want to kill him? It doesn't concern you. Does it hurt? Wait, let me see. The wound is open, it's getting infected, it needs to be treated immediately. I've found the first-aid kit. Damn it. Thank you. You're not going to tie me up? - Why are you shaking? - I don't know. I don't feel well. - I'm scared, really scared. - Scared of what? Of me, of us. I'm scared of what might happen. - Happen to who? - Happen to us. - Don't think about it. - But how is it possible... How can I not want to know what you're thinking? How much longer do I have to stay here? Why didn't you take his rifle while he was asleep? Stop it, eat. So that's how it is. Is he a good fuck, slut? You dirty slut! Let go of me! Now we'll see... We'll see if you can stop me. Stay back. - I swear I'll kill her. - Let her go, you bastard. Now the situation's changed. You're the one who's scared, you dirty son of a bitch! Drop the gun! Drop it! Now! Pick it up. Come on! Come any closer and I'll kill her like the bitch she is! Hurry up! You've got nothing to be afraid of, Giovanni. He won't talk, don't worry. They've raised their guard but they're still not relaxed. - We've got some news. - What news? - We got the man who testified for him. - Angelino Parisi? - Yes, the gardener. - Has he said anything? - Not yet, but we'll make him talk. - He must tell you what he knows. - We've also got his son. - Very good. Parisi is very close to his son. He'll talk. I don't think Molet will show himself. - There are too many people. - He might give up. He isn't the type. - What do we do when he talks? - The usual, don't leave any witnesses. - It's too dangerous. - I understand. This way we'll settle things with Parisi as well. - Who's he? - An ex-con. Even if he was a scoundrel... he didn't deserve to die like that. Don't think about it. It happened and there's nothing we can do about it. - What do I deserve? - What do you mean? What's going to happen? What will we do? I have a score to settle. What you want to do is absurd, it's an act of lunacy. It's a cruel vendetta that never ends, like a chain. Blood, blood... Seems like you enjoy the taste of it. And the reason? I bet you don't even remember how it all started. But the reason doesn't interest you. You're just glad it's your moment. Your moment to prove to everyone that you're a real man. An honourable man. Ready to die, and without fear. It's ridiculous, that's all it is. There's nothing noble about it. It's just stupid, stupid and ridiculous. Don't you realise how foolish this is? - You wouldn't understand. - Why? Because I'm a woman? A spoilt woman, who only wants to enjoy her life. You're right, perhaps that's what I am, but I'm not ashamed. And I don't plan on living my life scared someone might kill you. I'm leaving, if I'm free to go? Perhaps we can leave the country. - Let's go to Brazil, to my father. - No. You can start over, forget about the past. - I'll be with you. - I must avenge my brother first. Then what will you do? Don't you realise how absurd it all is? What if they kill you? It will be just another pointless death, like your brother... and all the others you've killed before. You talk like that because you're not from here. You don't understand what respect means. Respect? - Don't I count for anything? - I can't run. But I love you, I don't want to lose you. I won't abandon you. What will I do? I'm an ex-con. I have to go now. What's going on? Has war broken out? Don't worry about it. License and identification. Please open the trunk. - Well? - Right away. It's the fourth time you've stopped me, I have to go to work. I can't waste time. Look, there's nothing there. What do you want? Who are you looking for? I'm not a smuggler. Okay, you can go. Who is it? Angelino Parisi. - Who? - It's me, Angelino. The gardener. I didn't mean to... Where are you going? Behave. Take a look around. Well? Where is he? Where is he? The son of a bitch isn't here. It's just her. Bring her here. A friend of Molet. What is it? Don't like our company? In that case go away. See that? She doesn't like our company. We'll take care of you. Is he better than us? I'll cheer her up. - You think she liked it? - I'd say so. You go that way. You stay by the gate. - Please hurry. - Stay here. - Dad. - It's nothing. Be careful, my son. Get him! - An ambulance, hurry. - Let go of me. Let go of me! Let go of him.
