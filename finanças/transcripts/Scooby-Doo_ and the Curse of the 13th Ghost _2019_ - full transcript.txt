Subtitles by explosiveskull Here! The chest. Now, Vincent. Get ready, we've almost got him. Now! Do it now. Vincent, we did it. Mortifer, did... did we... Yes. We got him. That's all 13. It's done. "Done"? Hardly. Evil's minions will stop at nothing to open this chest and release once more the plague of their 13 masters upon our realm. - We have a duty, Mortifer. - Of course. We need to split up if we're going to have a chance. - Give me the chest. - No, it's too dangerous. - I won't let you. - Then run. I'll distract them. Go! There's no time. Ahh! Oh, no! No! Mortifer... Once upon a demon chest Where evil spirits manifest The best of friends began a quest And set out like a thing possessed In every corner of the land With a kid named Flim Flam and a van And steely hearts at their command They faced their fears and made their stand They thwarted evil Maldor's thirst And broke the shadow demon's curse And off to Marrakesh traversed To rendezvous with something worse From witches quoting magic rhyme To speeding up the sands of time Into Demondo's comic crime They fought and caught the demon Slime Phantazmo, Rankor, Zimbulu Do these sound like good guys to you? Well, thanks to our intrepid crew, Into the chest they each withdrew But now their hunt is nearly through Their final mystery, pursue And capture one last bugaboo The 13th ghost of Scooby-Doo. There he is! Ow! - Hey! Watch it! - What are you doing, Fred? He's getting away! Daphne, you should never run on a moving escalator. - Safety first. - Can we at least walk? Um, better not chance it. Now, what? Relax, everybody. The real trick of leadership is seeing the whole situation from above. Like the very top of, say, uh... a human pyramid. That's how you get the best out of your team and plan your next move. That-a-way. You see? Great work, Scooby. Come on, gang! All right, we're right behind ya! Oh, yeah. We got him. - Follow me. - Um... Shouldn't we booby-trap the doorway in case he tries to escape? Daphne, I think I know when and when not to booby-trap a doorway. Let's go. Hmm. Jinkies! - Uh-oh. - Zoinks! Now let's see who old Farmer Morgan really is. Ow! - That's odd. - Let me try. Ow! Stop that! That's my face! Looks like this ghost went a little heavy on the spirit gum. I don't understand. If it's not a mask, then that means he's... the real Farmer Morgan. That doesn't make sense. Farmer Morgan is selling the mall half his farmland for their big expansion. If it goes out of business, he'll lose millions. So, like, why does he want to shut this place down? He doesn't. Morgan didn't stage the mall haunting. Mrs. Malvo, the owner did. And I would've gotten away with it, too, if you'd left the meddling to these kids. But then why was he running? I'm afraid of teenagers. Hold the phone. You mean... we were wrong? The term is "criminally negligent." Criminal? How many times do I have to tell you kids? Mystery-solving is a tough business. Even for the pros. There's no room for mistakes. You're almost 18. After that, if somebody like Morgan presses harassment charges, you're looking at prison time. Like, gulp! But this business is too dangerous for slip-ups. - Case in point. - Huh? She's getting away! It's over, kids. From now on, there's only one mystery-solving crime stopper in this town. And he wears a badge. Also this cool hat. Let me be absolutely clear. If I see you driving that Mystery Machine of yours one more mile, I'm putting you away. Also, we do have a leash law in this town, so, you know. Thanks. I don't understand why we have to unload everything. I can't believe I just sold the Mystery Machine. Freddie, no one said it would be easy to retire. It sure looks easy for those two. This is the life, Scoob. No more mysteries, no more ghosts, and no more year-round fancy attire. Hey, I like your style. Thank you. Ooh. This just doesn't feel right. I love my Mystery Machine. I feel like I just sold part of myself. I know how you feel, Daphne. But it's not like we have a choice. Besides, it's already done. We've already closed all our cases and have absolutely no unfinished business. - None whatsoever. - Eureka! How much for the crystal ball? We have a crystal ball? Um, I don't think... Like, put that thing away! Oh, man. I know that glow. Shaggy? Shaggy, is that you? Did that thing just... Kids, I've been trying to reach you on this thing for months. Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby-Doo, where are you? We're here. What's up, Vincent? - "Vincent"? - I think he prefers "Mr. Van Ghoul." No, "Vincent" is fine. Listen, I found him. Or rather he's found me. Oh, no. - You mean... - The 13th and final ghost. You must come at once to catch him, so we can seal the chest of demons forever. Hurry, I can't hold him off any long... Vincent? Vincent? Like, I guess we've got some unfinished business after all. Who is Vincent Van Ghoul? What's a chest of demons? And will you take a personal check? - No! - All right, it's just a question. Daphne, are you gonna tell us what's going on here? We said we'd never talk about this. We have no choice. Vincent's in trouble and it's all our fault. "Our fault"? Listen, something happened. That summer you were both away at camp. - Real ghosts? - Don't be silly. Ah-ha, there it is. Ugh, how did I ever think this was practical? This is insane. I can't believe you never told us about this. The whole experience really traumatized Scooby. He almost had a nervous breakdown. So we decided, never to bring it up again. But you said there were 13 ghosts, and you only caught 12. Didn't you think with one still on the loose that it might come up again someday? Listen, if you're worried about Scooby, don't be. He's conquered his demons. Twelve of them, at least. Yes. What do you think? Whoa. Who are you? What are you two wearing? Not nearly enough. Nuh-uh. Relax, boys. We've handled 12 of these. Will one more kill us? Like, dude, that's the question, isn't it? Well, we'd love to help you, Daph, but I just sold the Mystery Machine, so... Don't worry. I've got it covered. You have a van, too? It's not a van. It's a strategic, all-terrain mobile command unit. - It looks like a van. - It was a van, then Vincent had a few upgrades installed. "MM"? Don't worry, Freddie, there can be only one Mystery Machine. What does it stand for then? Let me guess. "the Miss-tery Machine"? Um, no, but that's way better. Let's call it that. Okay, whatever, everybody hop in and, uh... Oh, wait, wait. This is a stick. I can't drive a stick. Everybody in. We're burning daylight. Grand tome? Please, it's barely 800 pages and most of it's the index. - Velma. - What do you want me to say? It's full of nonsense like, "The chest of demons can only be opened "by the living." - That's true. - Of course, it's true. Because the dead don't open things. They don't do anything. They're dead! Anything about the 13th ghost? Well, according to what you've told me, the one that got away is Asmodeus. King of demons. The most powerful of all evil spirits. Oh, man, like we should've gotten rid of that crystal ball when we had the chance. Oh, it's just an old story. - What the... - There's no such thing as ghosts. You think we were born cowards? Sister, the reason we're always on edge around ghouls and goblins, even fake ones, is that we've seen and fought 12 of the real thing. Hang on, gang. What's going on? Whoa, what's happening? I thought someone was tailing us, but I guess... Yikes! I... I hope he's got insurance. - Insurance follows the driver, right? - Yes! Well, then we've got a problem. Shaggy, Scooby, pull it together and deploy countermeasures. Countermeasures? Huh? Here goes nothing. It shoots oil slicks? Take that. That ought to keep him busy. It has a smoke screen? Phew. Somebody really doesn't want us on the road. Well, why didn't they just say so? That's a pretty sharp turn back there, Daph. Maybe you should slow down. You know, safety... First! Ah! That was awesome! This will be faster anyway. Vincent lives here? Only during winter. He's a snowbird. More like a snow bat. That's odd. The door's open. Come on, gang, let's... Let's follow Daphne inside. - No way. - I'm with you, Scooby-Doo. Like, no way are we stepping through those doors. Huh? Me? Uh-huh. Uh. Okay... Say, guys. - Would you do it for a couple of... - Ahem. One. You start with one and then we haggle. Where did you two learn to haggle? Flim Flam, of course. - Flim Flam? - The little huckster who used to travel around catching ghosts with us? About 3'6"? Sold us all those bottles of snake oil we unloaded at the garage sale? We never mentioned Flim Flam? Vincent Van Ghoul? The chest of demons? The Miss-tery Machine? And now a whole other member of the gang? There's a lot you never mentioned. Excuse me, I believe we were haggling? Look, I'm gonna say one Scooby Snack, you're gonna say three and then we settle on two, okay? Let's just cut to the chase. Like, easiest negotiation ever. - Thanks, Daphne. - Uh, I'm Fred. Not Daphne. Uh-huh. Ugh. This place gives me the creeps. I thought you didn't believe in creeps. I'm starting to believe in a couple. The place looks deserted. If Vincent took off, maybe he left a clue as to where he's headed. Let's split up. Scoob and I will check the pantry, the kitchens, and the snackatorium. - "The snackatorium"? - Like, I'm sure that's a thing. Where's your sense of discovery? You better keep an eye on Lewis and Bark over there. Got it. What's that? That's strange. I wonder... What do you think it means? They work like phones. Vincent called us on this crystal ball which means he was calling from another crystal ball. So maybe... It's a homing beacon. The two crystal balls are connected somehow. - So... - All we have to do is follow the glow, and we'll find Vincent. Fingers crossed. Come on. - Oops, sorry. - Oh! Sorry. My fault. - No, you first. - My fault. Go ahead, I'll follow you. Like this sure beats searching the dungeons. Right, Scoob ol' buddy? Indeed. Huh. Yep, as I suspected. This pulley system must run throughout the entire castle. All right, Miss Skeptic. But that doesn't explain the howling wind. Oh, hey, see if you can find some soup in there, would you, Scoob? Okay. What is it? Low sodium? Like there's nothing to get upset about. We can always add salt. Oh, just bring it here. Like, hey! Would you two knock it off? We're supposed to be looking for clues. Velma, no! Guys, I found the howling wind. It's just a recording played on a network of hidden speakers. I knew something was up as soon as we arrived. Stop fooling around, you two. We need to find out what the speaker leads to. I don't get it. We were led here, but I don't see Vincent or his crystal ball. It's a dead end. There's always a way out, Daph. You just have to look for it. Hand me your flashlight. Ugh, I left it in the van. Aha, there you go. You said it. It is a van. Of course, it's a van. I just didn't want you to feel like I was moving in on your turf. Which I am. Mmm. Look, I've been through all this already when you were away. I know how to "see the whole situation from above," and "how to plan the next move." I'm fine. Well, I'm not. I mean, there must be something I can do. Don't do anything. But, Daphne, I only want to... No, I mean, don't move. I think I see something. A secret passageway. We're back in business. Come on. Once Scooby has the scent, he'll lead us to the source of the... Like I don't need it Fredsplained to me, Velma. I'm in. Let's go. All right, Scooby. Got the scent? Uh-huh. Like, just let me know... Yikes! Keep it up, Scooby! Let me down, Scooby! - Like, what is it? - Just a false alarm. Scooby, it's only a couple of... Well, I'm stumped. This one really is a dead end. Maybe we should head back upstairs. No, the ball led us here. This is where we're supposed to be. It's probably obvious. I bet it's about to hit us right over the head. Did you hear... Like, mind if we drop in? We've looked everywhere, and there's no sign of Vincent and no clue as to where he might've gone. - What is it, Scooby? - Vincent. Vincent! Help me get the lid off. Vincent. Oh, Daphne, Shaggy, thank ghoulness it's you. Hello, Vincent. And Scooby-Doo, oh, how I've missed you all. Especially these last few weeks. It's Asmodeus. Like, we know. We read all about him on the way here. No, I mean, there in the shadows. Now, kids, open the chest of demons. Yes, the chest. Bring me the chest. You don't have to tell me twice. Like, where is it? - Didn't you bring it with you? - We thought you had it. No, I left it with you. And I mailed it back to you when school started. - Where did you send it? - Your real house. In the Himalayas. That wasn't my house! It was an AirBoo 'N Boo! Give it to me! It's not here. If you want it, you're gonna have to go find it yourself. Where did he go? To find the chest. As long as he holds it, it can't hold him. We must find it before he does. It's all my fault. Through here. King Solomon's private vault. The chest of demons. I think I hit something. One of the most important archaeological discoveries in history. Vincent, we are going to be famous. No, it's too dangerous. The chest exists. The demon chest in which Solomon trapped the 13 ghosts that plagued the ancient world. The evil contained in this box was never meant to be released. Vincent, what's wrong? The lock. The crowbar must've... So, what happened? Mortifer and I tracked down and trapped all 13 of the ghosts in the chest of demons. And that's where they remained. Until these two let them out. Well, at least, we've caught 12 of the ghosts. Who did they turn out to be? Crooked real estate agents? Disinherited step-children? Vengeful lighthouse keepers? Velma, we keep telling you. They are real ghosts. - Uh-huh. - And one is still on the loose. Asmodeus. The 13th and most powerful. How I had hoped he'd vanish from this realm for good. I faced him once before, of course, but Mortifer was by my side then. Whatever happened to Mortifer? We said we would protect the chest with our lives. And that's what he did, brave soul. He paid for my foolishness then just as you're paying for it now. Like, speaking of paying. I hope this portrait was cheap. It doesn't look anything like you. Well, sticking around here jabbering would be a grave mistake. We have to get to the Himalayas before Asmodeus finds the chest. But how? Uh, cranapple, please. Peanuts or cookies? Uh, one of each? Oh, my. This sure is a neat jet, Mr. Van Ghoul. Thank you, Fred. You'd think I paid dearly for it. But you'd be wrong. Dead wrong. See, Daphne? I don't mind being chauffeured. As long as it's a highly-skilled professional at the wheel. Uh-huh. Say, have you met the pilot yet? You should introduce yourself. Don't mind if I do. Like, come on in. Shaggy? Shaggy? It's "Captain Rogers" up here, young man. Not for vanity, but because when you got 10 tons of steel and the lives of every passenger in your hands, it's best to think of yourself as the office, not the man. Also, a little bit for vanity. Uh, Stewardess? That's "flight attendant." Whatever you say, toots. One thing's bugging me, Vincent. Castle Van Ghoul... The rigged shutters? The recorded howling? - That's right! Was that... - My security system. Keeps everyone away. I knew it! Not that it wasn't convincing. - But ghosts aren't real. - I wish that were true. But fear not, Velma, before we are finished, I promise you will change your mind about ghosts and goblins. Never! Pshht, hello, like, ladies and gentlemen. This is Captain Rogers. We are now entering Himalayan airspace. If you look out to the right side of the plane, you'll see a ratty old haunted temple. Pshht. Funny, I don't remember seeing that courtyard the first time we flew in here. Of course, we were a little busy crash-landing at the time. Nope. Hang on. I got it. This time. Oh! Ah, drat. Hang on, I got it, I got it this time. Drat. Daphne, my Air Boo n' Boo host just scream-mailed me back on my DiePhone. The package from Shaggy was never delivered by the ghostal service. What? One too many puns? Three too many. Maybe four. Where is everybody? It's a supernatural capital of the world. News reports say the whole village has been evacuated due to demon infestation. Asmodeus. Hey, don't we know that guy? He's the 13th ghost. You just met him at my castle. No, not him. Him! I like his style. That's it. He was at our garage sale. He was there. Oh, yeah, Bernie Alan. I still have the check he bounced. And he's here now? That's quite a coincidence. In my experience, Vincent, there is no such thing. My opera glasses. We better keep a close eye on this Bernie Alan guy. But not too close, okay, gang? We've got a runner. Looks like he's headed for the temple. Vincent, you, me, and the boys are going to follow that tourist. Velma, Fred, take the Miss-tery Machine into town to look for Shaggy's... Scare package. It's possible the post office has been holding on to it. But of course, the dead letter office. Mail goes in, but it never comes out. Sorry, force of havoc. Eh, habit. Hello? Deserted. Just like the rest of the village. Looks like Asmodeus got here first. Maybe. Come on. We laughed at Vincent, but he was right. This place is creepy. The sooner we find Shaggy's box, the sooner we can leave. He looks lost. I don't fully understand what we're doing. Is this all because of a bounced check? No, no, you said it yourself. It's a pretty strange coincidence this guy showed up here. I think he knows something we don't. Why don't we just ask him? Like, the man's a notorious check bouncer. We'd never get the truth. Unless... Hey, that's right. Vincent old buddy, why don't you cast the truth-telling spell on him? That ought to get us some answers. Right, of course, um... Let me see. Did you hear something? Oh, like, that's just Scooby's stomach. He hasn't eaten anything in over seven minutes. No, I believe I heard it, too. It came from down the road. Oh, no, he's gone. Come on. We've got to... Excuse me. No, Scoob, I think Daphne's right. It wasn't you! It... It was... You've gotta be kidding me. - Like, run! - Wait. This is crazy. First the guy from our garage sale shows up. Now the car that tried to run us off the road on our way to find Vincent? What's the connection? And then there's the bigger question. What's that? Why isn't it coming for us right now? Oh, no. All that motor revving... He was starting an... Avalanche! Say, Daph, now can we... Run! No! Oh, my... I don't think we'll ever finish checking all these labels. Hey, come on. Don't give up, Velma. You can do it. Velma, Velma, Velma! V-E-L-M-A. - She's the one who... - Why are you doing that? You're right. I don't know what my role is anymore. Huh? Huh. - Okay, that was weird. - I'll go check it out. Wait, it feels like a trap. Oh, Velma. I think I would know if I was walking... Oh. Gotcha. What's going on here? What's going on here is that I'm asking the questions, trespasser. Fine, but first I have a few questions for you. Oh, okay, shoot. Not sure why you didn't just check the package registry first. Seems more efficient, but what do I know? According to this, Shaggy's package was being held here until this morning. This morning? I can't believe we missed it. We'll just have to keep looking for the chest of demons. Wait, wait, wait. Chest of demons? Well, why didn't you say so? Come with me! I'm getting too old for this! Run! Phew. Well, the good news is that we made it to the temple. Like, I think I already know the bad news. Looks like those winters at my uncle's cabin in Aspen are finally gonna pay off. Everybody on. Tree, tree, tree. Vincent, now would be the perfect time for a door-opening spell. Kids, there's something I... Come on, Vincent, like, "Open sesame!" Hurry, before it's too... You want your chest of demons? All right. Prepare to enter the realm of darkness. Can we just go in? I'm freezing. Is that the chest of demons? - Sure looks like it. - Well, thank goodness, it's still closed. Oh, Fred, you're not starting to believe that nonsense, are you? Velma, what are you doing? Fred, it's just a box. No! See? Just an empty old... Jinkies! Are you insane? It's... Double-lined with a vacuum seal to keep your cold stuff cold and your hot stuff hot. It's a cooler? Of course, it is. Just a plain old cooler. Oh, well, if you're looking for something fancier, we've got it all. Chest of Demons coolers, Chest of Demons lunchboxes, phone chargers, you name it, we got it. And it's all celebrating the relic that made this village the tourism capital of the Himalayas. At prices so low, it's demonic. Come on, Fred. Uh, I can probably cut you a deal if you buy four. Or three? - Two. - Have you ever actually sold one? Once, a long time ago. Sorry, but we're looking for the real chest of demons. The real one? You mean up at the temple? At least, it used to be there. No, you wouldn't want to go to that place. Trust me. - Why not? - Uh, you're not ghost hunters, are you? In fact, we are. Now say you've got trouble with a capital T like the one in "tormented" and "terrified" and "truly trick-or-treatify." - Huh? - I'm talking about ghosts. I'm talking about goblins, ghouls, and beasts galore. To fight off fiends, and freaks, and more, you need a monster weapons store. A laser-guided harpoon gun will take down that leviathan. This silver-bullet cannon, yes, for stopping werewolves with success. A garlic bomb applied with speed will vex a vampire guaranteed. So, monster hunters, come on down, you'll soon be saying that you found the lowest rental rates around. Here at Benny's Monster Town! I'm guessing you haven't seen our commercial? Nope, but, man, you got some terrific rhymes. Well, with all the superstitious tourists coming through here, I'll bet you do quite a business. What can I say? Fighting the undead, it's a living. Whoa, neat. Give her a test run. - You can drive stick, right? - Of cou... Um... Just kidding. It practically drives itself. Now, what can I interest you in? Nothing, I don't believe in ghosts. What do you believe in? Science. Just because science can't explain ghosts yet, doesn't make them any less real. Nah, nice try. You're a good salesman, but not that good. We believe in facts, not fantasy. Right, Fred? Huh? - I said we're leaving. - Whoa, hey, hey, hey. Listen, it's really dangerous out there after dark. Thank you! Can you believe that guy? Whew, I know, what talent. And between the souvenir shop and the monster store, he's got two jobs. I don't even have one anymore. What are you talking about? Daphne's the leader. Shaggy's the pilot. Scooby digs up clues and serves cold drinks. And you're the resident skeptic. What do I do? You saw me on that scooter. I... I can't even do background hijinks right. Well, at least, you're honest. Unlike that salesman back there. Selling the same stories about things lurking in the dark trying to nab us. Let me tell you, if something was trying to nab us, I'm pretty sure we'd... Velma? Velma? Like, that was "snow" picnic. Why does it smell like wet... Oh. Like, relax, Scooby-Doo, we're still alive. Are you sure, Shaggy? Nope. How very lucky the door gave way. We could've been crushed. We're completely sealed in. And, dude, how are we supposed to get out of here? I have an idea, follow me and watch out. Places like this are always filled with booby traps. I don't suppose anyone has a rope? Looks like we have to find another way out. Like, come on, Vincent. Don't you have a spell that can make us fly? Oh, kids, I'm so sorry, I... Are you seeing what I'm seeing? So somebody left a candle burning. Big deal. "Candle"? Who lit that candle? I'll give you three guesses. I'll give you one. Zoinks! What is it? It's the chest of demons. Like, Asmodeus has it. Ow, my hip. And he's getting away. No, he's not. Come on, gang! I'm gonna miss this.

Like, namaste. You're just in time for the complimentary hour of guided meditation, brother. Let me relieve you of your burden. Oh-ho! Okay, so you're not yet ready to part with those earthly possessions. No problemo. Don't mind Brother Scoobert, he's observing the last year of a ten-year vow of silence. - I am? - Well, he was. Better restart that clock, buddy, old pal. All right, first you'll need to pretzel your legs like a lotus. And no, I don't know what a lotus is. But who doesn't love a good pretzel? Am I right? Man, I love pretzels. Hmm. Now, you'll need to free up your hands for this bit. So, Brother Scoobert, if you wouldn't mind. Now, is that any way to achieve inner peace? Speaking of peace, it's time for your mantra. Om. Like... Om. Om, oh, my gosh. We haven't got you a robe! What are you, a size six? Seven and a half. Seven? Seven and three-quarters. - Thirteen! - Thirteen? Zoinks! You're a big one, dude. Ahem, now slip your arms through the sleeves. Namaste! Namaste! Namaste as far away from you as possible-ay! Hmm? Ow, my tailbone. You got the chest! That would chain him, right? But the darkness is right on our heels, if you know what I mean. We've got to get out of here. Scooby, start digging. Yeah, you got it. Like, it's all iced over. What we need right now is a good old-fashioned snow-melting spell. I've tried to tell you. Ever since Asmodeus showed up, I haven't been able to cast a single successful spell. I'm having wizard's block. Give me that chest! You have to try, Vincent. It's our only chance. Spirits of the Scorpio, reveal your power. Let it flow into this realm with heated glow and melt this blasted icy snow. What's wrong, old man? No powers? Power. What... What happened? Like, it worked. You got us out, Vincent. Vincent? Huh? - Vincent! - Daphne, you're safe. It worked. How'd you do it? If I told you how the trick was done, it would no longer be magic. But if you destroyed your ball, how are you broadcasting now? I always carry a spare. Listen, I don't have much time. I'm just calling to say goodbye. Goodbye? Yes, Scooby. You kids need to run. This is between Asmodeus and me now as it should always have been. No, Vincent. We're a team. We can't... I must. I'm sorry I brought you all into this. Do not fear. I have the chest. For now. There's still time for you to get away. Take the plane. Save yourselves! Vincent! No. Vincent... What on earth? Hi, guys, mind if we drop in? Hilarious. - What happened? - Something... unexplainable. Like, where are your glasses? I don't need them. I see everything clearly now. Yes, everything. I think Velma just had her first real ghost encounter. I think she's still having it. Say, where's Vincent? He's in the temple with Asmodeus and the chest of demons. Well, then let's... No, Fred, it's over. The doors and windows are frozen shut. By the time we make it in, the chest will already be open. Maybe the sheriff was right. We're out of our depth. Because of some frozen doors? Come on! We've fought harder things than this. No. Daphne's on to something. I mean, what's the point? Ghosts exist. And they're about to take over the Earth. There's nothing we can do about it. Yeah, like, we're pretty good against guys in rubber masks, but when the monsters are real... We're just not equipped. Aw, Scooby, don't cry. Actually, Fred, those are tears of joy. You took the Scooby Snacks with you and we haven't seen you in, like, hours. It's true. It's all true. Oh, Freddie. Ah! Like, boo? Boo-hoo? Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo? Just take 'em. Oh, uh, and here are your keys. You keep them. I don't know what made me think I was cut out to be a leader in the first place. Okay, that's it. That is it! I've had enough of everybody feeling sorry for themselves. So you're a little hungry, right? Mmm-hmm. If you want your situation to change, you have to take action. - Here. - A snow burger? Like, wow. So you were wrong about ghosts. They're real and out to conquer the world. Are you just gonna let them? No. No, I'm not. - As for you... - Don't bother. Look at yourself right now, leading your friends back from the cliff's edge. You were born for this. You're heroic, and kind, and above all, honest. Oh, really, is that what you think? Well, then, it's time you knew the truth, all of you. I lied! Last summer, I went to cheerleading camp. Oh, that makes sense. You think I'm some kind of leader, Daph? Well, you're only half right. I'm a cheerleader. I've been down in the dumps, because I thought everyone had a job but me. But now I know what my job is. What it's always been. I'm the one who believes with all his heart in the rest of you. What is going on? Daphne Blake, for goodness' sake, it's time for a decision. Hit the brake or undertake a plan with great precision. Like, wow, his day has really taken a turn. So, everybody, rise and shine. Get on your feet and get in line. Let's bust a move, and bust a rhyme, and catch some ghosts. It's busting time! What'll it be, Daph, are you gonna rally your troops and take this demon out to lunch? Or are we just going to call it quits? Fred, I can't... Daph, you're the one who drives stick. You're the one with the plan, who always sees everything from above, and knows exactly what the next move should be. "From above." Okay, gang. We're going to the airport. Yay! Oh. This clutch. I can't... What are you looking for? My spare glasses. I'm pretty sure I left a pair in the van. Oh, here they are. Oh, yeah. This clutch! Every time! I can't... Get it to make... Oh, uh, that's not the clutch. You mean, this is not the... It's the emergency brake. That pedal over there is the clutch. Not a word about this to Daphne. Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm. Mmm. You can really taste the demons. Spicy. Ah-ha! I had a feeling you'd be back. You know what? I was a lot happier before I believed in ghosts. Oh, what changed your mind? Doesn't matter. What does matter is that right now, up in that temple, somebody's about to release 13 of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the Earth. So, we'll need one of everything. Wow, okay, um... let me just have your... Ah... Uh, no, right, of course, time is of the essence if you're gonna... Wait. Did you say "13 ghosts"? Pshht, like, we're 5,000 feet, open her up. Like, the autopilot's unavailable, 'cause it's engaged. Little cockpit humor for ya. But seriously, I don't think I can jump! That's okay. I'm going to push you. - Oh? - Like... No! They did it. Now let's hope they can stall Asmodeus long enough for us to get there with all this hunting gear. And stall Asmodeus long enough for us to get there with all this hunting gear. - I just said that. - Huh? Oh, sorry. I said, "And stall Asmodeus "long enough for us to get there with all this hunting gear." Forget it! And don't touch anything back there. You think we really should've brought him? He's the only one who knows how to use all this crazy junk, so, yes. Looks like we've got a bogey at 12 o'clock. How do you... This guy. - You know him? - Not really a him, so much as an it. Here it comes. Everybody, hang on. - Don't look! - I'm not! - Not you. - Yak, Yak, Yak. - Who asked you? - No! Look out! Yak! He's gaining on us. Go left! Go left! We can't drive on that. Trust me. Whoa! That was amazing. You ain't seen nothing yet. And the piece de resistance. Whoa, that was incredible. How'd you know how to do all that? Well, it's not my first time in a strategic altering mobile command unit. Now we just have to figure out a way to get inside. Leave that to me. Hmm. Oof! Scooby, did you take off your parachute? Uh, yep. Uh, nope. - Scooby... - Shh! Like, would you two keep it down? I'm trying to hear what Vincent and Asmodeus are talking about. Huh? Then take it. Strike me down and take it, if that's what you wish. I won't. That's right, because the chest can only be opened by the living. You need me. Nonsense! Now hand over the chest! We have to do something. - Unbelievable! - Yeah, this stuff melts anything. Come on. I would've thought all this toying around was beneath you. Maybe the great king of demons isn't quite the fierce monster we thought he was. Let us be done with this. I've lost everything to you in this decades-old fight. Starting with my best friend. - If Mortifer were here... - Well, he isn't, is he? He's gone forever. And soon, you can join him. I am the 14th ghost. Oh, dear. There is no 14th ghost. Like, that's what you think. No! Ahh! The chest. No! - Is that Asmodeus? - Nope, but a ghost's a ghost. Huh? Hi. - It's doing something. - Velma, now! Use the Vacuu-Spook. Huh? No, it's me! Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby? Ha! Nice human pyramid. Did you say "Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby"? Flim Flam? I thought your name was Benny. Oh, no. Benny owns the shop. I'm just the eye candy. Flim Flam, is it really you? Of course, it's me! Like, dude, you've grown up. Fast. I was long overdue for a growth spurt. Daphne, your hair is totally different. Shaggy, I've never seen you wear a shirt that isn't red. - Hiyah! - And Scooby-Doo, you haven't changed one bit. You know, I thought that red van was familiar. Well, I guess the gang's all here. Except Scrappy. What's a Scrappy? Come on, we've gotta find Vincent. Vincent's here, too? Was nobody gonna pick up a phone? Vincent! Flim Flam? Oh, this is quite a reunion. But I'm afraid it's too late! The world is doomed, and it's all my fault. That's crazy! We've all fought the 13 ghosts. If it really is the end, we're all responsible. No, you don't understand. The portrait hanging in my family's castle. It isn't of me but my ancestor. The first to bear the name Van Ghoul. He was the most powerful sorcerer the world has ever known. But power corrupts. Little by little, he used his magic to twist the will of man into his service. But the powers of good conspired to relieve my ancestor of his self-appointed throne. He was defeated, stripped of his mortality, trapped in a specially-crafted inescapable prison. Where, unfortunately, he had nothing but to wait and grow his already substantial powers. In life, he was called Asamad Van Ghoul. But now he goes by... Asmodeus. I'm the last of the Van Ghouls. And as such, the crimes of my ancestor are my responsibility and mine alone. I'm sorry I never told you. Old fool! It's finished! The chest is mine! Ugh! Oh! He's releasing the ghosts! We're too late. What kind of attitude is that? Ah... ♪ We've got spirits Yes, we do ♪ We've got spirits How about y... ♪ You know what? Bad timing. Velma, now! Use the Vacuu-Spook! No. What are you doing? Mr. Van Ghoul, something's bothering me. Is it the smell? In the last day, I've seen everything I believed turned upside down. Ghosts and demons were real. So I decided to play by that set of rules. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that rules are rules. And the first rule of the chest of demons is that it can only be opened by the living. Why, that's right! Yes, it is. I think it's time we see who this king of demons really is. No! It... It can't be. I saw you die. You saw an illusion. I was always good with illusions. The magician that tricked the wizard. - But why? - I wanted the chest, Vincent. But you wouldn't let it go. You thought it called to you. You never saw for what it really is. An artifact. Ancient, beautiful, and priceless. Priceless? Then how'd you come up with 10 million? That's your asking number, isn't it, Quinch? Bernie Alan? Boy, are you a bad penny. More like a bad check. "Bernie Alan"? Ha, I think not. Vance Linklater. Undercover Interpol detective and amateur figure skater. Swarm, boys. We've been tracking old Quinchie here for months ever since he began reaching out to the world's wealthiest collectors about selling them the legendary chest of demons. But the trail went cold after your garage sale, kids. So, lucky I was in town for the upper Himalayas Men's Interpretive Semi-finals. Like, if you're a cop, then, like, why did you run away from us? I'm afraid of teenagers. So it was only about profiting off the sale of an ancient relic. It was never about releasing the 13 ghosts. Like, speaking of which, where are they? What was with all that vapor? Yech, old sandwich. Oh, man! - What is it, Shaggy? - I think I shipped Vincent the wrong chest of demons. This... This one's the cooler I bought off Flim Flam. Told you I sold one. That still doesn't explain the lights and screaming mist. That's just part of the premium, total-immersion package. Well, you kids have been a great help. You should think about solving mysteries full-time. Wait a second. We're not done here. Oh, yeah. Huh? I would've gotten away with it... ...if it weren't for you meddling kids? - That's better. - I'm sorry, old friend. For impersonating my ancestor? And for this. That's my ride. Don't look so shocked. - We've gotta stop him. - Oh, just let him go. No, that car's engine, if he keeps running it like that... The avalanche! You're right! Mortifer, you must listen. The engine... Sounds fine to me. So long, Vincent! Mortifer, you fool! Stop! No! Asamad. He's at peace. Asamad Van Ghoul can finally rest. I... I don't understand. Well, it might have something to do with this translation. "Asmodeus will not rest "until he achieves his revenge." Only the ancient Sanskrit word for "revenge" looks a lot like the word for "redemption." Asamad Van Ghoul had a lot of time and a chest of demons to consider his misdeeds. He wasn't looking for vengeance. He wanted to be redeemed. If I had to guess, I'd say the 13th ghost, your ancestor, was watching out for you like a guardian angel. And now that you're safe, he can finally rest. Yes, that's right. I'm sure it is. Like, are you guys nuts? That was just a big glob of... Ow! I'm sorry about your friend. Huh? It's all right. I can always visit him in the ghoul-ag. He's gonna be fine. See, Daph, you got this leadership thing in the bag. All you needed was a little encouragement. A cheering section! You're not about to whip out the pom-poms, are you? I mean it. I'm sorry if I never saw it before, Daph, but you're the engine that makes this whole team run. Aw, I may be the engine, but you'll always be the driver. You think that, uh, Captain Rogers will let me fly the plane? As long as you stay away from the emergency brake. Velma! - So, after all that... - Indeed, my healthy skepticism is back. Hopefully for good. What about all that stuff you said about Asamad Van Ghoul? Those stories have been central to Vincent's entire life. I didn't wanna take that away from him. So you made it up. Okay, fine, the 13th ghost turned out to be fake. But what about the first 12? Mass hallucinations from high-altitude oxygen deprivation. I mean, it is the Himalayas. Okay, but what about your close encounter? Yeah, what do you think grabbed us and flew us up that mountain? I'm glad you asked. It was dark and I lost my glasses. And? Ski lift. - Oh, give me a break. - Oh, come on. Clearly, we wandered into the path of a ski lift, and our clothes got caught. I could pull up a dozen articles about similar incidents on my phone right now. Okay, fine, I'll prove to you that ghosts are just stories. The real chest of demons. Can you believe it was in the van with Shaggy's luggage the entire time? - What are you doing? - Are you nuts? Yeah, Velma, I mean, what if you're wrong? Ugh, fine. - What? - Nothing. Oh, hey, Shaggy, here's that case you asked for. Lotsa Luck Joy Juice. Aw, Flim Flam, I remember this stuff. Told you it could melt anything. Like, are you sure you don't wanna join us on our trans-haunt-tlantic flight? Nah, somebody's gotta stick around and tell the tourists the tale of Asmodeus. The demon king who almost ruled the world. And make a tiny profit off the merchandising, I suspect. Don't worry, Vince, I'll leave old Mortifer's name out of it. Thank you, Flim Flam. I'll see you when I'm in town for my coven's next meeting. Bye. And for ghoulness sake, Flim Flam, please, stay out of trouble. No promises, Vinnie. That's my boy. Bye! So long, sports fans. Everything okay? Yeah, just thinking about our impending retirement. Well, as my last official act as leader, I'm calling it off. - Huh? - This is what we do best, Freddie. I'm not ready to give it up, just because we made one tiny mistake. And by the way, I'm still not convinced old Farmer Morgan was totally innocent. I agree! First off, the guy's boot prints were all over the ghost's secret lair. - Second... - Imitation yak jerky? Imitation yak jerky, anyone? Hang on a second. Shaggy, if you're back here, who's flying the plane? Scooby-Dooby-Doo! Subtitles by explosiveskull
