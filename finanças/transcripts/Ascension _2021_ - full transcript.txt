The client called and asked to narrow the skeleton frame. Use the light brown paint for the areola. Hold on, we need to paint the areola first. There's only one nipple so far. We need both nipples finished before we can paint the areolas. This nipple was supposed to be a deeper pink. More like a rose tone. Let's try the Number 3 pink. Number 3 pink. This private part hasn't been trimmed. Give me the scissors to trim this. Next time, don't make this mark too hard. It's cracking, it must be fixed. - Are you wearing perfume? - Yes, I put some on this morning. - I can't smell it under the mask. - I can smell it. Your nose is so sensitive. What type of nose do you have? A rabbit's nose? More like a dog's nose. - Don't hurt yourself. I'm scared. - It's all right. See. What you did won't work. I need to fill the larger hole. This area is still empty. Did you try fixing it? Yes. Just fill it up. - Did you use the iron? - Yes. The iron isn't hot enough. 400Â°C isn't enough? See, it's not melting.

Then toss it out and get rid of it. Each article was carefully selected. Some are work-related rules you should know. They will tell you how to behave at work, and boost your working efficiency. Hello, Zheng Jun? Hi, Boss Zhou. I had a stomach flu this morning and felt sick, so I took an hour for sick leave. Okay. I saw that you haven't seen my request time off, so I wanted to give you a heads up. Okay, I will approve that later. Okay, thank you so much! Get up! Right dress right! Eyes front! When your hands hurt, don't give up! I want the max strength from each person! Everyone shout. I can see some mouths not moving. Too quiet, shout! Shout!

When you have troubles at work, use today's spirit to fight it! The problem can be solved, no matter how hard it is. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome Class 19107 to Yuan Da City. I'm Zhou Ling, from the human resources department. Let me introduce the leaders who are joining us today... Hu Chunhui, the deputy CEO, and the manager of company, Ke Jian. Hi, everybody! Tang Bisheng, the Koneti Corporation, deputy manager. Long Qizhi, head of the air conditioning department. Wong Xiaohe, the head of the recruiting and training department. We hope you can carry on the merits and traditions of the upcoming company cultural training and real work environment, and set some new records. Stand out! Behave myself! Follow the order! Behave myself! Follow the orders! Eyes front! One! Two! One, two, one! One, two, halt! I will now escort those just registered to the campus building to input your fingerprints. Then I will show you your dorms. Buying is a choice, one we don't have to make. So why do we still buy things? In the old days of China, there were not many resources. We call it "the planned economy." You couldn't even buy certain things. Today is a new age where every day we have new products, hundreds of thousands of them that have never been made before. So we are dealing with one question: Why should people buy from you? And why buy things? Because you're a brand. "I trust you." "I like you." "I'm your loyal fan." Why do you come to my class? Tickets aren't cheap. We're big fans. You're my fans, right? If you have as many loyal fans as I do, your life will be good. Because we're in a fan economy era. If you have a large fan base, you have everything. You have to be a "Star Boss". Otherwise you're a boss without fans. That won't last very long, right? You're a dead boss. So what's the name of this program today? "Star Boss..." "Monetize your personal brand." Is knowledge worth anything? No, it isn't. Knowledge must be monetized. Today, knowledge is found everywhere. You can find all kinds of links in your browser. Are they useful? No. Even if you can memorize 300 ancient Chinese poems, it's still useless if you don't know how to monetize. Hi, I'm the founder of Mister Ox Dating Training Club. After this workshop, I decided to earn 2 million next year. And then make 30 million in three years. It's all right. He's not a very outgoing person because he likes arts. After the two-day training, I decided to earn 10 million next year. And earn 30 million in the next five years. My decision is to make 10 million in a year, and make 100 million in five years. After the two-day training, I decided to earn five million in three years. My three-year goal is to make 50 million, and my five-year goal is 100 million. ...100 million in one year, and 700 million in three years. After the two-day training, I decided to work to death. So no matter how ordinary you are, you can still create your own brand. Place in clean water and count to five. This cloth can do public dancing. Count 2, 4, 6, 7, 8... It's OK, don't be nervous! Let's start over, listen to me now. Listen to me now. "Soy sauce and oil are really hard to clean, "but we can't cook without them. "What do we do with greasy plates? "Use our cloth, clean in one wipe. "You only need water to finish the job." Forget the tedious things we used to say in sales. Just keep the flow. Pick what feels smooth, keep it flowing. Get it? I can't even wash the wipers. Life is short, when you look back, it's late. It's not easy to live a life, when you're old, you realize that nothing is valuable. You're rich, you're poor... At the end, you're old. Whether I'm good or bad at talking, this is a new era. Smile for the new era, don't be glued to the damn phone. Cherish our parents, wife and kids. Ready? 1, 2, 3, action... Life is short, turn back and look, it's dark. It's hard to live and you get nothing when you're old. You're rich, you're poor, you get old. Reformers, entrepreneurs, you all get old. Whatever you do, open your mind, even if you fail. Don't be afraid to try, it only makes things harder. Listen to more music, listen to Peking Opera. Don't be angry, the enemy is ourselves. Let's play games, let's watch, let's keep our families happy. The only enemy is ourselves. Don't be disappointed, don't be depressed... My bad. Okay, start ever. Actually, "observe" comes first, then "compete"... - "Bi" and "Li". - Exactly. - Did I say it wrong? - You say "observe" first, then "compete." Don't worry, it will come to you. Our new towels come in different colors. We have them in purple, blue and pink. And this blue one, all kinds of them. If you need a colorful cloth, we got you. Hello, good afternoon everyone.

You can see this side is brighter after I applied the foundation. It has better gloss than the other side, see? Many of the cuties like to buy pretty stuff for selfies. This case looks great in a selfie. I didn't realize my relatives watch my livestream, too. My mom watched my livestream yesterday and "liked" it. I asked her, "Why don't you talk to me?"

Check out this popular 3D night light. It has three types of lighting. It's a great gift for your husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend or your kids. Wearing shoes is like living in a home: the more space, the more comfort. The room is the space around it. It's the material of the shoe sole... This is like a glue stick. These are stray hairs here in the front. Comb them with your fingers, and then glue them to your head with the hair stick... to get a neat and perfect finish. Your hair is so rebellious. Wrap it once around the lower loop, and bring it up. Yes? Then tie it, the bottom stays at the bottom. Then cross the two, and turn it this way. This side goes through this hole. Who wants to be my model for the hair tutorial? There is a saying that every Chinese woman is a pretty Chinese business card. So every Chinese lady, let's present the prettiest image of China! Let's bring the pride of China's 5,000-year history to show the world the prettiest smiles. Hello, everyone. Good morning. It is nice to meet you! This is a kind of exercise for your muscles. If you practice this continuously, it helps us to control facial expressions Okay? Let's do our warm up dance together with music. Today, we'll learn business reception etiquette. At work, how many teeth shall we show when smiling? - Eight. - Which eight? - The upper eight teeth? - Correct. - Sure? - Yes. Some people are silent. To be clear, it is the upper eight... Eventually you will look gentle and beautiful, yet reasonable and clear as a person. How high should one wave? Normally it's just one fist under the armpit. And if you're far away, you should raise your hand a fist higher than normal. When you nod just enough to touch your fist, that's the most appropriate angle for nodding. It's for angle searching. If you want to hug someone, you should get ready 5 to 7 steps away. When opening your arms, the action should be standardized, the right arm higher. For example, if I'm going to hug you from here, don't say, "It's been a while since I've seen you." Don't walk in from of the one you want to hug, then suddenly open your arms. That's abrupt. Anything else? Teacher Ji, I'd like to ask if the strength of the hug should be strong or just gentle. It might feel perfunctory. How strong should it be? This is a very good question. Sit down. In practice, the hug isn't led by us. Because for Chinese people, in business occasions, we don't really like to have a hug. Chinese don't like physical contact with others. So if a person hugs you tightly, then you hug the person tightly. If the other person hugs you gently, we also hug her gently, right? In your actual work and life, if the other person wants to hug you, your basic courtesy is to return the hug. Hugging isn't particularly common in China. The principle of hugging is that you cooperate when someone hugs you. Yes, Mr. Ji. I have a question. Hugging is okay in normal office places. But sometimes I am invited to drink with a client, and the client appoints a subordinate to hug me. I see, the client sends girls. When they send girls, I usually refuse to hug them. I don't know what to do at this moment. This is a very practical question. I think if you give her a high-to-low hug, it's no problem. I suggest that if she opens her arms to you, you just accept. But don't fully hug her like this... In this age of internet, either you influence me or I influence you. Either you're overwhelmed by my ads, or I'm overwhelmed by yours. One! Two! Three! Ready? Danger! Push-ups. What's your fucking problem, Tang Sha? You get it wrong all the time. What are you doing? Are you a clown? What are you doing? Have you ever done one movement correctly? Have you ever gotten it right? You're unbelievable. What are you doing? Take it back. Ready! You stay there. Danger! Take it back. Ready. Danger! Pay attention to where you're standing. Are you protecting the person? Let's find out who's slow. The last one to finish will be punished. Don't waste it. Ready! Go! Not good. Have you seen the viral video like this? Try to copy that. - What the heck? - Report! Danger! Go! Where are you pointing? I've killed your boss. How many times have I told you about physical blocking? Did you two do that? You allowed too much space between, so I could kill your boss. "You died, Boss, but we got away." I'm gonna shoot you. It hurts a lot. A bee stung me. It fucking hurts. Is it supposed to hurt this much? I'm looking the bee up. Bring me an ice pack. What's wrong with the girl? That's nice. Don't move! The car crashed and people died. One! One! Count it in your heart. Count one to five in your heart. - Understood? - Yes! Ready? One! Good. Don't wobble. One! Go! Start the beating! Align the plate with this water glass. This should align with the steak knife. This fork is about a finger's distance from that glass. 27.5 plus 6.5 equals what? Let me calculate. 27.5 plus 65... 92.5 plus 25... Then plus 55. Like a Swiss army knife, a butler may be stretched out and used like a tool, as a knife, a wine opener, a match... Very versatile. Has anyone seen the show "Downtown Abbey"? It was a very popular Western show. Many people in China grew wealthy overnight. Our society today is so focused on material gains. The new Chinese elite send their children to top schools here and abroad. They go abroad to shop, and have money to drive nice cars. Now they want butlers. I had a student from Beijing who graduated two years ago and is now a personal assistant. His first daily task was to squeeze out toothpaste for his employer. That was his role. He squeezed it into a cup, and it was ready to be used. You may not have any time for your own life, or time to be with your family. Please repeat... Why do we teach you to use a fork and knife? We aren't making fun of you. You must practice the formal Western way. Some dishes can be stabbed. You can do it that way. Our clients are mostly rich people. They tend to do whatever they like. They take out their bad mood on you. As a member of the service industry, you have to act professionally. I hope you can remember that. Since this is just school, you can make mistakes, but you cannot make mistakes after graduation. You can't show a sour face to your employer. They are the person who pays you. No matter how he humiliates you. Be obedient when facing him. You can curse him behind his back. But when facing him, you have to pretend to be obedient, okay? We are ordinary people. That's how we see ourselves. That's what I told my son. We said, "Maybe you're an ordinary man your whole life." And that's fine. But you can still enrich yourself. Think about what kind of person you want to be. That's your job. Don't debase yourself to make money. Make money the legitimate way. - I think Big Uncle Xi is really good. - Yeah, he is. Foreign countries accuse China of denying human rights because they see China as a dictatorship. But there's still so much economic inequality in our country. So the poor must first focus on survival. If you can't survive, how can human rights exist? It's just all for show, made-up slogans politicians invent. Regular people like us won't buy it. We should just focus on making a good living. Please turn around. Please turn around. Hands. Our water park wave facilities have state-of-the-art designs. And in our park, no matter your budget, we always serve with genuine passion so you can feel close to the sea and sunshine! Shit, the Blind Monk is coming. Yasuo the Unforgiven. You are so lame. You're as lame as a motherfucker. You can't even conquer the silver game. One more Sausage Chops for A8. Sausage Chops spicy or not? Why did I lose again? This cigarette tastes bad, the other brand is better. Okay, thank you, Bro Lang. - Who ordered it? - Me of course. You have enough power. The vampire is an easy kill. What are you doing? Just kill him. A featherless phoenix is worse than a chicken. A featherless phoenix is inferior to a chicken. You can touch the sea creatures gently, but don't take them out of the water because if we take the starfish out, it'll die sooner or later. If you've been captured on camera, bring out your sexiest moves! How many of you are ready for college? I know how exhausted you all must be after exams. Let's make a huge splash and wish them all accepted! Best of luck to all you applicants to get a good score and therefore go to your dream school. Here we have roasted ham from 48-month-old pigs. It was marinated in European pear liqueur and rum. We mainly make French desserts. And we made some improvements based on that. First, have some cheese. In between, you have berries. The sourness of the berry will balance the cheese's sweetness. It has rich flavors. French dessert often focuses on layers. It was air-dried for four years, no? - 48 months. - Right. Try the ham with wine. This is called the "King of Hams." Our butler should come and introduce this. The outer layer has salted caramel flavor. In the middle, there's a vanilla ganache. And chocolate on the bottom. So if you want it to be sweeter, cut the caramel off the top and eat it with the rest of the dessert. Take a look at this glass. Look at its shape. We often see glasses with the same width. But this angle is meaningful. Many Europeans have big noses. When you drink, your nose might touch the mouth of the glass. Out of cleanliness and dignity, they designed this type of glass so no matter how big your nose is... You'll be fine. This is a traditional European bell to call your servants. Call your servants. - Hold it here, right? - Right. Hold the head? Or the neck? Either way. - Sort of heavy. - Each has a unique sound. Wow! Mine is high-pitched. - Mine is... - Yours is also high-pitched. You should hold the top. Yours are all high. Only mine is deep. The main purpose of it... Houses in ancient Europe were so huge, you couldn't yell at your servants. - Right? - So rude. So normally the master has a bell in the house. In nearly every room. How do servants know which room the ringing is coming from? Probably based on instinct. Here, honey. Our first meal after we return from Xinjiang. Right. Why do you visit Xinjiang so often? To research ski resorts. A boss wanted to start a China-Swiss friendly ski resort. So I went to help him. - Have you been to Xinjiang? - No... - I do want to go. - I can bring you next time. - I don't dare go. - Why? - You think so? - Don't worry. There were people in the group who felt the same as you. - The media says bad things happen there. - I want to go to the U.S. There are fewer people going to the U.S. because of the trade war. But to be honest, I like the U.S. True. In terms of freedom because I long for freedom. Personally speaking, I'm a young patriot. For the most part, I love this country. Though not in a cynical way. I think China has grown much stronger, especially in recent years. China's a confident global player now. Totally. Because our education is better. Especially those born after the 80s tend to have Western-influenced education, unlike previous generations, who lived in a closed era and had limited access to global affairs. It's the same in any country. The government doesn't want people to be too smart or too dumb. Humans are moving forward, but there has to be a balance. No matter how politics change, the aspiration to acquire more knowledge and information can't be stopped. There's tons of information in this digital age. True. And people want to explore the truth. Right. Rather than people figuring out themselves, the government should just tell them. A wise governor should know the line. Now let's welcome Chairman and President Mr. Zhen Chunying to show us what a cutting-edge cosmetics company looks like! Let's give an ovation to our President Zhen! Dear JALA family, welcome back home! I'm not sure whether you've noticed, I've gained some weight. Anyone noticed? No! I love hearing the truth from you. China has the single biggest consumer market in the world. But our per capita consumption level is far lower than the U.S., which means our possibility for growth is big. When China's consumption potential is fully realized, our consumption will be at least five times more than America's. We are not as easily defeated as we once were. I believe in the next round of competition. China's native brands must win. This is an era where good people can make money. People who are dishonest and have no contract spirit will never succeed in this market. Economic growth results in wealth redistribution. Along with growth comes a social phenomenon, which is wealth redistribution. And wealth only goes to whoever deserves it. There is a saying that China is a fair society. If your wealth doesn't match your intelligence, society will have hundreds of ways to take your wealth away. I believe hard work will be fruitful, and dreams will come true. Dreamers are undefeatable. Let's get one with you looking here. Turn your face that way. Turn more, look up, turn again. Chin up. Okay. One, two, three. Okay, perfect. Let me see. Great. One more time. Good, good. Walk towards me. And look at me. The hat, the hat again, it's covering your forehead. Once more, swing harder! 1, 2, 3... Nope, no, no. Bend over and swing your hair harder. It's so hot here. - I'm dying under this sun. - Let me see. I featured your leg here. Looks amazing. That's good. One, two... fix the hat. Okay, nod along, yes. Give me a big smile. Big like "ha-ha." Fantastic! Let me see. Great. This looks beautiful. - My legs are on fire. - Good, we got it. Good burn. They burn, but it's worth the pain. Your legs look amazing. - Ow, my legs. - Good, you can go change now. Let me see where you can go. Oh god, I can get a heat stroke here. Let's go somewhere else.
