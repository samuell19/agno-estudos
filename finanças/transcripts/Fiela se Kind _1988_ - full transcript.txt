(wind whispering) (birds chirping) (creek lapping) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (poignant music) (child laughing) (pleasant music) (dramatic music) (perky music) (chattering) - [Boy] Come on, everybody, come on! - [Woman] Careful! (hooves clattering) - Let her go! - [Woman] Benjamin, you're right in the way of the ostrich, she'll kick you! - (mumbles), watch it, watch it, (mumbles)! - Stay behind! (shouting) Polly, run so you can go around him the other way, run! - [Boy] Come on! (mumbling) - (mumbles) could turn the bird (mumbles), drive her to the other field so that Kicker can have a look at her! (chattering) (laughs) Ah Kicker, I said I was gonna get you a hen. (plodding music) Look, here she comes! Did I lie to you? Stop running around now and stay right there! Let her settle down for a while in her new home. (sighs) Isn't she a nice hen, Selling? A bit skinny around the old bottom, but we'll get her fat again within a month. - Fiela, what's that? (cart clattering) - [Fiela] You've got peddlers. You tell them straight we're dealing Rosinski. - Well we've got rock rabbit skins. - Just the rock rabbit skins but not for under two pence a skin, or we won't sell! Hey, you should put on weight before you marry Kicker. Who wants a skinny bottom? - And what if he doesn't want her? - Come on, come on! - What will her name be, Ma? - Her name is Polly. She cost me six skins plus two of my good whips, so expensive birds are named Polly, and that's it. - Help me take her to him now, Ma! - Never, Kicker must like her first. - The cart has turned this way, Fiela. - Tell 'em two pence a skin, not a penny less. - I say it's preachers. - Who comes to preach on a hot summer day? They can go over the hedge. The Lagans need their preaching. David, take Polly up to the old camp and bring water, she's thirsty! Did you hear me, David? - Yeah, Ma. - Then go on, I don't want to see you here! I don't want to see any of you near the house! (insects chittering) - Good afternoon. Handsome bird you've got there. - He's not for sale. We keep him for breeding. - Can we have something to sit on? - What's the master's business? - Census. - What do you do? - The government wants the people in the country counted. - For what? - Don't you count your chickens at night? - [Fiela] Sit over by the door. (sighing) - Your surnames plus first names. - Uh... - Selling Komoetie. - Date of birth. - That's difficult. - Just more or less. - When the English came with the ships I was born. - Could be 1820. - To me he looks older than (mumbles) on top of it. - Put down 1820-- - Kitty what are you doing here? Go and play somewhere else, if anybody comes near this house there'll be trouble! - And you Mrs uh, what pestilence or disaster were you born in? - I'll go and get our bible. It's all written down. (sighs) Let him break a leg and stay in the veld but please god don't let them find out about Benjamin! (somber music) - Let me see. - I can read. - [Man] First names and date of birth. (animals squawking) - Fiela Maria Pulls, born 19 October, 1836. Everything is written down here. Married Selling Komoetie, on 3 January, 1859. - Where were you born? - Here. All of this my father owned, and it's now in my name. All the papers to prove it are with Mr. Karencross in Uniondale, we're not tenants. - Children? (water splashing) - Now that's uh, four children is that right? - We have a fifth child, he's called Benjamin, Benjamin Komoetie. - Benjamin. - Born 13 February 1862 it says here, and he's 12. - Komoetie, and he's 12. How do you make your living? - A little bit of wheat, a little bit of maize, and a few vegetables too, for the rest, Selling always manages to dress a few skins and now and again we sell feathers. (animal braying) We also tap aloes when they flow. - [Man] Which church do you belong to? - Independent church, it's our own church seeing that the London Missionary Society left us to carry on alone with nothing. - Mom! (mumbles) right into the pool, it didn't even capsize! Afternoon master, afternoon! - You go back to the veld now I told you to go and watch Polly! - [Man] Whose child is this? - My child. - B-But that's a white child. - It's Benjamin my foundling. - Come here sonny. I want to ask you a few questions. - You need answers master ask me, I'm his mother. - You're foundling is he? - Yes. - Where'd you find this child? - Where's a person get house lamps? I found him where his mother must have left him, that's where I found him, middle of the night, in front of my door. - And when was that? - [Fiela] Nine years ago. He was three then. - Who gave you the right to keep this child, it's a white child! - What then, leave him standing outside? - Are you trying to be clever? Your magistrate could have taken care of it! - Magistrate and where was he, we only got our magistrate the other day! - So, you thought you could take him. - I didn't steal him from anyone! - Ma... - Go and play, Benjamin. Go and put your little boat in the water, go, go! - [Man] Wait a minute, wait a minute. Now, do you remember the child that got lost back in the forest? - Was that really nine years ago? - Yeah, he was about three years old then. - Listen here master, you know what your problem is? You want to fish in a piss pot. - Wait it's all coming back to me now. He was three. That little boy back in the forest-- - Has master seen this mountain at the back here? It isn't a mountain, it's peak, on peak, on peak! And when the mountain ends the forest starts. And the master's seen the forest, but now you want us to believe that shit story of yours a lost child who walked for 50 miles through that big forest and over mountains and ended up barefoot, clean and tidy on the front steps of Fiela Komoetie's house! - And what about the road? - Which road was that? Nine years ago the road wasn't there. So don't come to my house today master and stick pieces together that don't belong together! - Sonny, come here. - Leave him alone! Master leave the child alone, please! - I won't hurt you sonny I just want to look at your boat. - I think we should take that child with us to Knysna. - Master, then you will have to come and cut my throat first! He's my child, and he'll be that till I'm dead! Everybody in this kloof knows and accepts and keeps it to themselves, but now you, you just want to get your damn claws into him! Listen master, today you wrote down that boy's name in the book of the government as Benjamin Komoetie, and so it shall remain in that book till the end of our days! - You woman lied to me! - And you master know no more of the proof in this case than Fiela does! - Did you make it yourself? - My Pa helped me master. - You'll frighten the child, please master! He knows no other mother, he only knows Fiela! - So when we get to Knysna, I'll find out about the other child. (book snapping) - Ma, why are some people white and some brown? - Are you asking me about the Good Lord's work now? Do you know why a sparrow's black and a weaver bird yellow? - But why are you brown and I'm white? - Because you're the foundling. Put those over there, they're not dripping on the sheet. - Ma, why did you tell them that they'll have to cut your throat first before you'll let me go? Were they planning to do it? - Ach, they were talking to the wind. How can you just come and take somebody's child away? - Ma... - We must finish here Benjamin, Kitty and Emma already have two big stacks dripping. Tomorrow we can start cooking out. - Will they take me away? - I will not let them take you away. But the day is coming nearer when only God can help us. - Are they coming back? - Pa's not going to let go of you. (relaxing music) (birds chirping) (glass clinking) - If I could only get hold of some good ivory, cheap. You know how much the ships pay these days for elephant tusks? - Why don't you finish off the beams first? - Pity you don't know what my back feels like. - Next week they're coming to fetch the wood and you'll still be sitting there. - What about you? Weren't you supposed to dig the garden today? - I finished digging yesterday. I'm waiting for those pumpkin seeds you were going on about. - Barta when are you gonna cut the girl's hair, just look at her! (chickens clucking) (bottle clinking) - She won't let me. - [Man] Since when does the brat have a will of her own? - [Barta] The scissors are too blunt anyway. - Nina, go and ask Aunt Sophie for the pumpkin seeds she promised us! - Aunt Sophie says, she won't give us anymore, she says we never pay it back! - That's a bloody lie! Go and get 'em from Aunt Molly! (bottle clanking) How old is the kid now? - 11. - Then it's time she started earning. They tell me there's English people in town who want white girls to look after their brats for money. Four shillings a month. We can use money like that. (spitting) (hooves clattering) - Good day Van Rooyen. - Hmm, Mr. Kapp! I didn't see you. - You're no further than last time. - It's my back, Mr. Kapp. The damn thing's killing me. - You have two sons working for Mr. Williams, why didn't you tell them to come help you? - Well it's no good if we all cook in the same pot. Sit down. - The magistrate sent me Van Rooyen. - I didn't do a thing! - That son of yours that disappeared, what was his name? - Hmm, him? Uh, Lucas. - Lucas. - How long ago was that? - Eh, Barta? - It was nine years ago. - Really, as long as all that? - Yeah, he would have been 12 now. - Oh he'd a been quite handy on my beams, I'm always way behind. - There's a chance they found your son. (tense music) - What are you saying Mr. Kapp? - But just a chance. - Barta! - They found him on the other side of the mountain in The Lange Kloof, with colored people. The magistrate wants to see you and your wife in court on Friday to identify him. (playful music) (chattering) - [Benjamin] All the way Polly, quick! There she (mumbles), close the gate now, close it! (scraping) - She's doing fine, that's it! (laughing) That's it, that's it, (mumbles), she's inside, we'll catch you bird! So Mr. Almighty Kicker you can forget looking away, I'll notch a nick for you today if you try and fight her! You treat her and behave yourself like a gentleman, do you hear me? - Polly, take Kicker as a bridegroom and Ma'll bake a fine sugar cake for you! (laughing) (tense music) (cart clattering) - Benjamin, get lost now. - Ma? - Get lost I said. - Are they coming for me? - Fiela! (hooves clattering) (horse snorting) Fiela! - [Fiela] Shoo! (birds chirping) - Morning. Still busy with the ostriches (chuckles)? Mr. Goldsberry sent us here. A new magistrate has been appointed. He wants to see the child. - Well I don't really object to it. I'll let him see. - I must take the child to Knysna. The magistrate wants to see if the other woman can identify him. - But why didn't you bring the woman here if she wants to see the child? - This is no ordinary case. These are matters the magistrate must preside over. - I'll take him myself to Knysna on-- - The magistrate wants to see him on Friday, not the following week! How long do you think it would take you to walk all that way with a child, it's too far for him! - I don't follow you master, master's the very man who said he did it solely and entirely on his own when he was three years old! - You stop this or I'll put you down on the wrong side of the law! Tomorrow morning I'll come here to pick him up! - Then you can take me with him in the cart. - There isn't room for you! Tomorrow morning, six o'clock! - Oh Jesus master! I gave the child my promise he wouldn't be taken away! He's so close to me master, the dear lord looks down upon us and he writes down each teardrop the child sheds through our evil doings! Has master really no heart? Take me with you, we'll walk back! - I've had my say! - If you hadn't of said anything this whole thing would never have happened! - The child is white, he doesn't go to church, he lives like a heathen, and you don't send him to school either! - And why must I, I teach him the Lord's rules, and besides that I teach him sums and to write as well! - Did you think you could hide him here forever? - I'd never hide this child! I kept him away from adders and fools like you! - Fiela! - Listen I warn you, I don't accept insults from coloreds like this! I warn you, I'll send a constable to pick him up! - Ma, what if that forest woman says Benjamin's her child? - Then she's lying, go on, throw it in. Benjamin, bring yourself here (water splashing) so that I can see if that shirt fits you! Ah, better too big than too small. Right, get undressed so you can start washing. (insects chittering) (sighing) Oh... (hinges creaking) (wooden thumping) Go on, make yourself scarce. (sighing) (water splashing) (sighing) Climb in child. - I told you ma, I'd wash in the stream, I'm not a baby. - That's not good enough to stand before the magistrate tomorrow. Sit. (water splashing) (hollow thumping) Saturday they'll bring you back here my child, I promise. - I'm afraid, Ma! - You don't have to be afraid. (water splashing) Listen, you mustn't call the magistrate there master, you call him My Lord. - Is he our lord? (slapping) - Don't pretend to be stupid, Benjamin, he's the law! Anyone who tells him a pack of lies gets himself thrown into jail backside first! - Ma, please come with me. - There's no room for me in the cart! What must you say when anyone asks you what your name is? - Benjamin Komoetie. - And who is your ma? - Fiela Komoetie. - Who is your pa? - Selling Komoetie. - Where do you live? Wolwekraal in the Lange Kloof, our own, - Property. - property. What if they don't bring me back home again? - The magistrate will see to it that they bring you back. (water splashing) (mumbling) Give me your foot! - Ma! - Hold your foot still Benjamin! I've packed your things for you in the small trunk. Right at the bottom is your nightshirt. Put the new shirt on, on Friday, but take it off after the magistrate's seen you and put it neatly back in the trunk. Don't crumple it up! - No mum. - David says he'll lend you his very best jacket, but don't put it on on Friday. I want them to see you in your new blue shirt. If it's cold, put the old one on underneath. - Yes mum. - The five shillings that I tied up you mustn't take out of the trunk box. It's for in case of. - For in case of what? - For in case of the magistrate's asking if you have anything on you, so he can see us Komoetie's aren't naked asses! - What if I lose it? - I'll fry your hide for you! (crickets chirping) - We must move on now Barta. (sighing) Well it's still a long way to go. - What if it isn't Lucas? - That's why we're going. (scuffling) - Eh, mom! (horse snorting) (whimpers) Mom! (wind whistling) - Come on, get on now. - Hip! (cart clattering) (sorrowful music) (weeping) (sobbing) (cart clattering) (pensive music) - [Benjamin] I must wear my jacket on Friday. I must wear my best blue shirt. I must keep it clean. - [Man] What are you saying? - Nothing master! - You must stop calling us master, you are not colored! (sniffing) Why do you sniff like that, you cold? - No master. - Don't say master. (footsteps clacking) (clock ticking) (door clicking) - Come up here. (hinge creaking) What is your name? - Benjamin Komoetie. - Did you ever have another name? - No. - Can you remember anything before you arrived in the Lange Kloof, anything? A dog you had, anything at all? - Ma had a little dog once, but it was bitten in the throat by a wildcat. Now she doesn't need one, now she's afraid a dog will chase the ostriches, Your Magistrate, Your Honor. - Think back now will you, a few years back, and tell me what you're thinking about. - Uh, eh, I can't think so well when I'm scared, master. - You need not be scared lad. (door clacking) - This is why I skipped school for! - Silence. (wooden pounding) (door clacking) - Mrs. Van Rooyen. - Please come closer, Mrs. Van Rooyen. Come and look at them. Take your time, look as long as you want to. (throat clearing) (clock ticking) (gasps) (ominous music) Son, you understand what has just happened here? That's your mother standing before you. It was you who disappeared from her house nine years ago. - I'm Fiela Komoetie's child! - At the beginning you'll find it a bit strange, but you'll soon get used to it. - I'm Fiela Komoetie's foundling! - Your name is Lucas van Rooyen! - I'm her foundling, the Lord committed me to her care! - Pardon? - I swear master, I'm not a lost child, she's lying! - You're white Lucas, you're not a Komoetie. And you're big enough to understand that. We were grateful when we heard where you were, so that we could give you back to your rightful parents. - I'm Fiela Komoetie's child master! We're not naked asses master I swear it, I have five shillings to prove it! Master, please! - I don't want you to use that word master ever again! You're white, and you must learn to behave like a white man's child! - No please Magistrate Your Honor! (scuffling) I'm Fiela Komoetie's child, and my Pa is Selling Komoetie! - Come on you! - Hey master, please master! - (mumbles) come along! - [Benjamin] Please help! (insects chittering) (lamp thudding) - We gonna eat or we gonna wait ma? - We'll wait. I think we should eat. (rooster crowing) I'm going to Knysna. - But it's two days on foot, Fiela! - The Lord gave me feet. - Ma, what if he is those forest people's child? - Well then I'll eat this table legs and all. Tullie, go, get some firewood. (birds chirping) - Ma, what if-- - Listen, what if my foot? (sniffing) (gravel crunching) - Put down your bags Lucas. Say hello to your sister, Nina. There's your two brothers, Willum and Christofle. Lucas I'm talking to you! Lucas I'm talking! - Elias! Leave him now, he's afraid! (panting) (thumping) - Little bastard! - Elias! (clattering) - [Elias] Come back here! (rustling) (panting) (grunting) - Uh! - Come on, I'll teach you to behave yourself! I'm the master of my own house and from now on you'll do as I say! - My brother's names are Tullie and David and my father's name is Selling! - We'll see about that. We'll see about that! (bell ringing) (hooves clattering) (chattering) (children laughing) (David whimpering) I'll knock all that damn coloredness out of you! You run away from your pa again and you'll feel it! - (mumbles) must be awful for the child, to have grown up with the brown people and then, all of a sudden to be so white. (bell ringing) (knocking) - Yes? - I'm looking for the Magistrate, my master. - Go to the side door. - Oh please master, I must speak with the magistrate, it's serious! It took me two days on foot to get here! - I'm afraid I don't quite understand. - Oh Jesus master please get somebody who can understand me! - Go to the side door, I'll send somebody. - Morning. - Morning. - Uh... (doors clunking) Today you must slither like a snake Fiela. If you stand in front of a white man to ask a favor you must stoop low. (knocking) - Yes aunty? - Man, I could almost shake your handle so, where's the magistrate? - On the bench aunty. - So please go and tell him Fiela Komoetie from the Lange Kloof came on foot all the way to see him. - Does Mr. Goldsberry know you? - How could he know if you don't tell him I'm here? Does he speak our language? - Yes he does, but he's busy. - He'll stop being busy when he hears what charge I got! - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. (thumping) Hmm, hmm. (birds chirping) (relaxing music) (carts clattering) - Fine today you'll slither like a snake Fiela. Yes you'll slither. (footsteps tapping) - Yeah what's the problem? - She says she wants to make a charge against the magistrate. - Listen to this man lying master, I would never say anything like that! Two men came to us last week in the Lange Kloof to take my child, they said that the magistrate said they should and that they'll come back on Saturday with him master! I've waited long enough now! - Are you talking about the white child? - Ach, Jesus, master, you know the moment I saw you I said here is a white man whose face tells that he knows of things! That's the exact child I'm talking about, about Benjamin Komoetie, the small child I found and brought up as if he was my own. (chuckles) If master will be so good as to take me to the magistrate to see him, then I'll take the whole thing up with him! - Wait just a minute. (footsteps tapping) - Do they pay you to sleep on your broom the whole day? Hmm? - I'm just watching the world go 'round. Seems to me today it wants to show you its bottom. - Old man take care I don't give you a kick in the bottom! - Uh... (broom scraping) (grunting) (footsteps tapping) - Slither Fiela, head low and slither. - Listen Missus, the magistrate says the case was finalized, and the child was returned to his parents already. - Jesus master! - I was present, the forest woman identified him among four other boys. - There's no truth in it master! - She took him home on Friday. - I sincerely beg of you (forlorn music) master, can't I meet this magistrate? - The magistrate is busy Missus, and the case is finalized. (footsteps tapping) (door thudding) (poignant music) (birds chirping) (flames crackling) (footsteps thudding) - It's a sweet potato! Can you keep a secret? You'll get monkey buttocks all day just sitting and sitting! - I'm waiting for my ma. - Pa says he'll only give you today to sort yourself out. Tomorrow he'll whack you! - He's not my pa! - Yes he is, you're Lucas who got lost in the forest! - I am Benjamin Komoetie-- - Shh! (exotic bird singing) Do you hear? - Huh? - The bush lo-ree! Do you hear him? - How far away is the road that goes to the Lange Kloof? - Is that the big road? - The road that goes from Knysna to the Lange Kloof. - Oh that big road. - How far is it? - Far! - Will you show me the way to get there? - I have a secret I want to show you on the way to the road, do you want to see it? - Yeah! - Come! (carefree music) (birds chirping) (rustling) - Where are you girl? (mysterious music) Where are you girl? Where are you? Where are you girl? (chuckles) Where have you gone? Oh stop playing around! Oh, where are you hiding? (whistling) (birds chirping) (rustling) (panting) (giggling) You stupid thing! - You were really scared, really scared, really scared! - You're (mumbles) stupid! - Come on let's (mumbles)... - You said you'd take me to the big road! - [Nina] Why do you want to see the road? - I want to go home! - You must stop your nonsense 'cause if pa gets mad at you and gets to the horse whip he'll beat you till you're stupid! - Look, I have five shillings. - (gasps) Where'd you find it? - My ma gave it to me for just in case. - I want to see it! - I've hidden it. But if you show me the way out of the forest I'll tell you where it is. - It's too far to walk to the big road, we have to start early in the morning! - Swear you'll take me tomorrow. - Swear you'll give me the five shillings if I take you! - I swear. - That's good. I swear too! - You always say you get feelings about things don't you? (scraping) What are your feelings saying today about Benjamin? - I daren't listen to my feelings today Selling, the devil keeps barging in on me when I do that. (metallic slamming) Come on, bake! (birds chirping) (rustling) (glass clinking) - What is that? - My secret. This one I picked up in the wood but the others are all stolen. (bottle whistling) Pretty huh? I do bird sounds too! (bottle whistling) - So what's so great about that? - Nothing it's just a secret, but it's good! So only I knew it, now you know it, that's what's strange, see? (low-pitched whistling) - You're strange, that's what's strange. - Well at least he went to the forest with her this morning. - She must stay out of the forest, it's no place for a girl by herself. - Oh you won't keep her out of the forest. - Then I'll tie her up like a runaway ox. I tell you, there's something wrong with that kid. She reminds me of that crazy sister of yours who ran away to the Cape! - She's a child Elias! She'll grow up. - Then why doesn't she play with Molly's children? - They don't want to play with her. - And why not? I tell you there's something wrong with her, has she got worms? - Don't know. - No woman you don't know, I always have to do everything. Tomorrow I tell you, tomorrow at sunrise, I'll put those two on the beams! (clattering) (sighing) (grunting) Come on, push. - We won't get this thing up here, pa! - [Elias] Dammit, push, push harder! - [Nina] Why we won't get it up here! - Just do as I say Nina! (grunting) Push! - And if it rolls down on top of us? - Then it's your own damn fault, now move it! (Nina panting) (wooden clattering) Look where the sun's going! Today you'll learn to saw the beams. - [Nina] No that's pa's work! - I've worked long enough on this scaffold with my sore back! Here both of you strong and healthy, saw both of 'ya, saw! (panting) (saw grinding) - What's our plan if he watches us all day? - You wait our chance'll come! (spitting) (saw scraping) - I've looked through the whole Bible now Ma, I can't find it! - Then look until you can find it! Selling why don't you say something? You can't just sit there breathing all day! - The child will die over there in that forest. He needs open spaces. - Kitty, did you look in the Book of Kings? Look in the Book of Kings. Solomon said that they must cut the child in two and give each mother 1/2 of a child. - I mean, even if it is his ma, he is not used to the forest world. - Selling, tonight I want to ask you just one question, and you must give me a clear answer you hear, not a half of one. Do you really think a child of three could walk all the way through the forest and end up here? Do you really think so before God? - No I don't think that, - I said to you Selling, - but I-- - I want a clear answer, you hear? Not one with a but or an if following at the end! - Well then my answer's no Fiela. Not a child of three years. Not unless he's-- - Selling! (sorrowful music) (insects chirping) - Why are you sitting here in the dark? - I'm sitting. - If you are sitting, what are you thinking? Lucas? - I miss my ma. - She's become quite pretty, eh Master Petrus? - Yes Fiela, it doesn't look like the same bird at all, you've done a good job. - Kitty, go and make Master Petrus a nice cup of coffee. (chickens clucking) Cut him a slice of that nice fresh bread, too! - Why don't I see you people anymore, Fiela? - Uh you know. We've started sowing. - Yesterday I saw Selling down at the house. The poor man looked very down. Is there something wrong with him? - Yeah I was thinking of sending someone to the shop to go and buy him some (mumbles) balsam. - For the last 14 days I haven't seen you at the prayer meetings either. - Are you saying you go to church every Sunday, master? - Fiela. Don't push my hand away when I'm trying to help. Have you got into trouble with the Lagans again? Or is it money, come on, come on, put your pride aside and tell me. - Tell him now, Fiela. - Then there is something wrong. - Yeah Petrus Zondagh, they robbed us Komoetie's and the crib. You go back to the kloof and you tell everybody they can laugh, and maybe you should tell the Lagans too, they like to spread stories! They came and took Benjamin from us. The man said Saturday they'd bring him back. I was so stupid to believe it. What else was there to do? (plate clattering) - Yes I know it's hard, Fiela. (coffee splashing) But you must have known that sooner or later it was bound to have happened. - What for? - Because he's a foundling. - You mean he's a white foundling. If he was brown, no one would'a ever said a word about it. - And what if the Lagan's had found him? - There are brown and brown, Petrus Zondagh, just as there are white and white. That forest woman will have to look me in the face and say what her child had on that day. - Please keep away. No one can expect the woman to remember what clothes the child had on nine years ago on one particular day! - Not one particular day Master Petrus, the day that child got lost! - Um, I swear... - Can you remember what your children had on that day? - Yes, they had their nightshirts on! - (chuckles) You're right, it was during the night. - Yes Petrus Zondagh, you stand like the magistrate, and I cannot move you when you two fight me with law books in your hands and bugger all in your hearts! That child has a heart of gold and gold is soft. Master listen to what I have to say, I alone will tear this damn world apart if you hurt one hair on my child's head! - Fiela! - Quiet Selling you know nothing! - Monday morning I'm taking horses to Knysna. While I'm there I'll talk to the magistrate. (birds chirping) (rustling) - Nina, where are you? (gasping) I'm tired of waiting for you all day, where were you? - In the forest! - In the forest? - No, no! - You're supposed to be - Don't hit me again, - working, not to play in the forest! - god no, no (sobs)! (mumbling) Stop it (sobs)! (scuffling) (weeping) - Come here you little bitch! (weeping) Where's Lucas? - He's gone! - [Elias] He's what? - (sobs) He ran away! No Pa! - You (mumbles)! (dramatic music) (panting) (insects chittering) (water splashing) (birds chirping) (tense music) (leaves rustling) (panting) (birds chirping) You bastard! Get back here! Get back here! God help me you (mumbles)! (Benjamin screaming) (scuffling) - No let me go! - You say you ran away, huh? Where were you going? - I, no, please master, (leathery slapping) please (screams)! - What did you call me? - No, (mumbles)! - Please, sir! - What! (leathery slapping) Please who? - Please, please uncle! - Uncle, I'm not your uncle! I'll beat it out of you! (leathery slapping) (whimpering) Tell me who I am, say it! - I don't know! - And you don't know! (leathery slapping) I'm your pa, your pa! Who am I, say it! Say it! - P-Pa! - Who are you? - Benjamin! - Who? - Lucas! - Lucas who? - I don't know! - Lucas van Rooyen! (leathery smacking) (whimpering) Say it! - No! No (sobs)... - Now you will stop this shit! Guess who? - Yes, yes Pa. - In you go. Sit down there, remove this trouble! - Elias, what have you done to the poor boy? - There wasn't time to do anything but hit him. - What if the magistrate sees him, what then? - When I want to do my fatherly duty do I have to ask the magistrate's permission first? I found him a mile from the big road. You showed him the road! - No Pa! (dramatic music) (clattering) - (mumbles) your damn hair is such a mess (Nina screaming) that you lie so much! - My hair, no my hair! - Come here! (Elias grunting) (Nina screaming) Hold still! (Nina screaming) I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget! (hair snapping) (Nina shrieking) - [Nina] (sobs) No papa, no, no! - There's no doubt about it Fiela, he's the Van Rooyen's child. - That's balls! - Easy now Fiela. Fiela, among four other children, all of them blond, all of them of the same height, she pointed him out. - How could she know him? - Fiela, now don't you go meddling, it'll get worse for you! He was lent to you, but now he's back with his own. - And the child, has he no say in it? (maudlin music) - We all know you've always been a good mother. And he'll realize that when he's older. And with respect, come and show his children where he spent his childhood. But if you're about to divide the child now then you won't get anything. (clanking) (birds chirping) - [Elias] You see this tree? - Yes? - Yes who? - Yes Pa! - Climb it! - [Benjamin] Eh... - What are you afraid it'll bite ya? (grunting) (mumbling) Climb the damn tree! Nina, show him how to climb a tree. (Nina grunting) Come on, climb! You'll dig a hole here. I'm not gonna sit around and watch over ya. And if you hear a branch break, don't look around to see if it's elephants, run, climb! - But that tree over there is much better to climb! - And what do you think I'm gonna climb? I want the hole right here, right across the footpath. I'll catch those elephants this time. Five yards, (rustling) by three yards. And six feet deep. - What's that hole for? - A hole in the ground. For today you're gonna dig till your tongues hang out. I'm tired of doing everything. - I'm Fiela Komoetie from the Lange Kloof. I almost knocked that side door out of its frame but nobody opened it for me! I've come to see Solomon the Wise. - I beg your pardon? - Solomon, the one from the Bible. I've heard that you keep him here, somewhere. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I just wanted to find out from him why only one woman was sent for when the child had to be divided. - It was explained to you the last time what happened! - Then the master knows that I came here the week before last as well! - I have been told so, yes. - Then the master must also know that I had to turn around and go home without setting eyes on the magistrate! - [Man] I don't know what you're talking about. - And that I had to swallow the constable's brew of lies about the child having been returned to his real mother! - I'm not sure you know who you're talking to. - No master, but the one I really want to talk to master is the man who tried to play Solomon over my own child two weeks ago, the magistrate! - You are standing before the magistrate! (gasping) - At last after so long I'm standing before the right man! Your Magistrate Your Honor, now the two of us will talk this thing out. - The child was given back to his rightful parents, the case is finalized. - That's not where we must begin, Magistrate, Your Honor. We must begin by how Your Honor thought it out that, that, that a little child of three walked all the way to the Lange Kloof! - I'm warning you. - Has Magistrate Your Honor ever been in the forest and over the mountain? - The fact that the child was in your home for nine years unlawfully is a serious offense, and I consider bringing a case against you. - That child I brought up like my own. And now the forest woman has all the say. Who says the forest woman didn't point out the right child by accident? - Among four others, in front of witnesses? - Master, I came a long way, now I'm sick with worry for the child. I don't stand here for myself, I stand here for the child. God forgives us many things, but he never forgives us the wrong we do to children. I stand here in master's power, and I ask you this. How can master be sure the forest woman wasn't just lucky? - I've had enough of you! - Master don't get hasty with me now! Go and send for the forest woman to come and tell you what her child had on that day. And I'll also tell, then master for the peace of your soul can decide! - Even if you showed me his clothes right now, how will I know that you're not the one who's lying? - The uh, year we had the plague of crickets, they ate all the clothes we had master, but I won't lie master! I'll swear on the holy book over there! I'm asking master just this, make the forest woman come here - That's enough now. and I'll-- - Are you going now or do you want me to call the constable? - Ach Jesus master, I beg of you master! - Constable! - How can I go, uh... Please master, uh, uh, master he knows no other mother than Fiela Komoetie! Just as soon as the ostriches start breeding, then I'll buy out the Lagan's and all of it will be put in his name see, and it'll be with pleasure that I bring you master - Take her out of here! - two ostrich chicks! - Uh uh I'll go master, I'll go! But just tell me where the child is, and what people is he living with. - [Magistrate] I forbid you to go near the child! If you set foot in there I'll have you arrested! (birds chirping) (hooves clattering) - I came to see how the boy's getting on. Magistrate's orders. - (chuckles) Yeah. Eh, to tell you the truth Mr. Kapp, I really want you to see for yourself how well he's doing now, yeah. - Is he here? - No, he and his sister went to play in the forest. Happens every day. (chuckles) Yeah (mumbles) they should be back any minute now. (tense music) - Van Rooyen, that's their name. - And how do you know? - Petrus Zondagh let a small cat out of a big bag. Van Rooyen. I'll find them, even if I have to look till I drop dead. (bottle whistling) (soil scraping) - Did you know there's real fairies in the forest? (bottle whistling) Hey Lucas! - That's a lot of nonsense, Nina! - I swear it! - Tell me why we're digging this hole? - (chuckles) So why are you asking me, why didn't you ask Pa yourself, huh? (Benjamin sighing) (shovel scraping) (birds chirping) (shovel scraping) - Nina, you coming to help me or not? - In a minute! - Tomorrow they'll scream at me again! (grunting) - Come and show me, I can't get it right! - [Benjamin] N, I, N, A, it's easy. Both Ns were backwards, you see? (chuckles) There. - Good, now write your name. - Which one? - You're real name! - B, E, N, - Aw, shit, I'm going home! - My name is Benjamin! Benjamin Komoetie! It's written down in black and white in the government book! - [Nina] Oh shut up Lucas! (hinges creaking) - Yeah? - Afternoon. I'm looking for Master Elias van Rooyen. - I'm Elias van Rooyen. - I'm Fiela Komoetie of the Lange Kloof. (spitting) I came to see my child. - Don't tell me you're the creature from the Lange Kloof! - Yes I'm the creature, it's my child you took from me with the magistrate's help. - Your child? Where would you get a white child from? - It's also not your child, master. How could a child of three walk through this forest, and cross the (mumbles) on his own and end up all tidy in front of my house in the kloof! Without a scratch on him, with nothing! - I'll set the magistrate and the whole government on you! And tell that boy to get his dirty ass off my logs! - His ass is cleaner than yours, master. Missus, is it you that said Benjamin is yours? - Stay away from my wife. - [Fiela] What shirt was he wearing the day he got lost? - I said leave my wife alone! Get lost, now! - Why won't she say, is she afraid or what? - Barta, bring the horse whip! I'll whip her right out of the yard if she won't leave! Take your rubbish and get out of here! - Master I'm asking a most easy thing master! I'm just asking what clothes he was wearing! - You move off now or I'll whip ya! - These are his things, it's for him I bring them. - He isn't here. - If I could only see him once now, just this once, then I'll go master, I swear! I only want to tell him it isn't my fault they took him and brought him here! - He doesn't care, he's happy to be with us again! - That's a dirty lie! - Do you think he wants to stay with you colored people forever? He never even talks about you! - Master! - He never wants to see you again, he's finished with you! - Let the child say with his own mouth! - I tell you he isn't here, he's playing in the forest! - Then I shall wait master. - I won't tell you again. I'm going into the house now. When I come out, I'll have my horse whip. I'll strip your skin off! - Missus, you're also a ma. That child is like my own. I took him just like my own four children and with a sad feeling in my heart too missus! David will say it's true, just ask! - I'll strip your skin off, brown woman! (poignant music) - I just want 10 words with Benjamin! If I can see him, just this once! Only 10 words, missus! - Get into the house Barta, and stay there. I'm gonna kill this brown woman. (scraping) (thudding) - See, that's a fairy there that's moving! Do you believe it? - Heh, heh... - (mumbles) is grandmother Sherwin, she said she almost stepped on a little fairy in the forest, she really got a big scare! - I wish I could believe it. - (mumbles) doesn't lie and her grandmother wouldn't! (birds chirping) (mysterious music) What are you doing now? - You see, there's nothing. - You frightened him now! Now he'll always hide himself when he hears us coming! (Benjamin chuckling) (coffee splashing) (hinge creaking) - How deep is the hole? - Why are we digging that hole Pa? (chuckling) (door thumping) - Where did that come from? - It's the things they brought for you. - What, who brought it for me? - A woman with the name Komoetie. - Where is she now, where's my ma? - This is your ma! (chair clattering) And don't you start your damn nonsense again! Tonight I'll bash the last bit of coloredness out of you! - I want to see what she brought for me! - Elias I'm begging you! (mumbles) - What did she say? Tell me what she said! - She didn't say anything, she just brought your things, that's it! Tonight I promise you, she'll never put her foot in this forest again! - Leave my things Nina! Give it back! - I just want to see (sorrowful music) what it feels like! (sobbing) (poignant music) - Barta! (distant roaring) Get away! Barta! - Elias, what happened! - They were there, waiting for me when I got there. (wooden thudding) I'm, I'm afraid for my life! How can I trust the forest anymore? Those elephants are out to get me I tell you! (sighing) My saw, the hatchet, lunchbox, your blanket. Ooh! - Sit still Elias. - Uh I had to leave everything just like that. - Because of that trap, I told you they'd trample you! - If I have to move my body from this chair then you'll be sorry girl! - (tongue clucking) I really don't know why you bother year in and year out with those traps. - Ah, two tusks, just two tusks, I can sell them to ships for as much as a year's beams. Just two tusks. - Yeah but just look at you! - Some day I'll beat those elephants I swear it! Elias van Rooyen will get rich one day. (Nina giggling) You can laugh, I'm gonna hire you out! Barta, what about a cup of coffee? - Oh there's no more coffee. - What do you mean hire me out? - Go on laugh my girl. I'll tell you what it's about. Mr. Kapp is finding you work! - I won't go! - Nina. We already spoke about this matter didn't we? - Do I look like a children's maid, huh? - It's four shillings a month, remember? And food, and clothes. You moan that you don't have any clothes. And you'll learn to read and write. And every day you can swim in the sea! And look at the ships, and everything! - I won't go Pa! I won't go out of this forest! (hinge creaking) (sobbing) - Maybe, she's got to get used to the idea. - She will get used to it Mr. Kapp. Yes by Sunday when we take her away she'll be used to it. - Nina, walk a bit slower! - Shut up Lucas! - I don't know why you have to scream at me all the time I didn't do anything-- - You can all go to hell I'm not a children's maid! - It's better than making beams! - The money's not even mine, it's Pa's! (sighing) (steers lowing) Look, there he is! - Yes, that's him! - We can go back home 'cause he hasn't seen us! - And then what do we do? - We run away! - Uh-uh. - Please Lucas, I don't want to go! - It's better than sawing beams! - I'm afraid of all those people! - Come on. (tense music) - Ouch! - What's up, I only touched your arm? - Just look at that! - Was it Pa? - Yeah, and this! And just look at my legs! - Then why do you want to stay with Pa, Nina? - (sniffs) I want to. - Come on, he's seen us now. (melancholy music) (Nina weeping) - Oh please Lucas I beg you, I don't want to go! - Come on. (Nina weeping) - Come on, come on, hurry up! - Oh please Lucas, please! - Come on, get on. (sympathetic music) (sobbing) (Benjamin mumbling) - Up, move along you (whip snapping) lazy devils, (mumbles), that's the way! Yah, (whistles)! (steers lowing) - Take care Nina, take care! - Hiya, (mumbles)! Hiya! (wagon clattering) (steers lowing) All (mumbles) of you, (mumbles)! Bull move faster! Yah! (poignant music) (birds chirping) - You under-- - Yes. - You tell her to come back with you or send me the money for the last three months, one or the other. - Yes Pa, what if I can't find her? - No what ifs, Lucas. - Thanks Ma. - Just look until you find her! - You know what Nina's like, and you know I never wanted to go to the town. - Something could have happened to her, she could be dead, Lucas! (spitting) - There's nothing wrong with her, she's hiding from us again. But Lucas is going to look for her, until he finds her! (footsteps rustling) (birds chirping) (forlorn music) (sighing) (majestic music) (waves crashing) (birds chirping) (relaxing music) (knocking) (footsteps tapping) (latch clicking) - Yes? - Miss Weatherbury? - Is there something you want? - My name is Lucas van Rooyen. The people in town say my sister works here. Nina van Rooyen. - Your sister? - Yes. - No. The Nina van Rooyen who is employed by me has no living relatives. - My, my sister sometimes pretends many things. - Well, she's not here now. - My pa sent me to come and look for her. Because we don't hear from her. We thought she worked for the schoolmaster but, he said she'd left there. I hope she hasn't made trouble again. - Nina is such a rare child. - Yes. (waves crashing) (birds screeching) (rocky clattering) Excuse me. - Hmm? - I'm looking for a girl, her name is Nina van Rooyen. - Nina van Rooyen. - Yeah. - She left here early afternoon with her aunt, on her way to Noochy. - Uh, is it far? - An hour's walk. You know her? - She's my sister. - I didn't know she had family. Heh, so you like the sea eh? - It's pretty. Are you a seaman or what? - I work for John Benn. - Oh, what do you do? - I row. - I wish I could row. - You looking for work? - Uh, well... - Go and talk to John Benn. If you work around here, you work for John Benn. (birds screeching) (waves crashing) (clanking) This here, is Connie Glen. Here, only the sea and Kaliel September are boss. Don't look at my house like that. It won't collapse. - What does John Benn pay a month? - Not enough. I sell a few chickens and fish and things to Mr. Horn's Hotel and to the ships, or else I'd have died of hunger long ago. The ships pay very well. - Why don't you work on the ships? - Oh they don't want me. - And why not? - Uhn, it's a long story. (chuckling) John Benn too, he wants to get rid of me. (tools clattering) But they can all do what they want, I'll keep what I have. - Nice place you have here. (seabirds squawking) (waves crashing) (footsteps rustling) (panting) Nina. (chuckling) - How'd you know I was here? - Don't you say hello? - Does Pa know too? - He-- - You won't tell him, you understand, and shut your mouth! - Nina! - Given my money to him for too long now! Tell Pa he's not getting anything from me, tell him to lift his ass - Now Nina! - and do some work! - We were really worried about you. - Worried about my money. That's right isn't it? That's why Pa sent you, come and get my money. - He's still saving money for a heavy rifle. - Isn't he ever gonna leave the elephants alone? - A few days ago he was almost trampled to death. - I've had it with the damn forest, Lucas. I've had it with Pa too. - I can see that, you don't even ask how they are. - You still stripping bark? - Yeah. - I don't know why you do it, (sighs). - Hmm, I don't know either. - For years they treated us so badly. - Not Ma Nina, Ma's a very good person. - Yeah you were protected, she never worried about me. (sad music) What are you looking at? - You've grown up a lot Nina. I almost didn't know you. (Nina chuckling) (waves crashing) - [Man] Ahoy! (seabirds screeching) Ahoy! (panting) - Morning Uncle Benn! I don't mean to worry you Uncle Benn! - [John] Nobody's uncle! - What's Uncle Benn saying to that ship? - [John] John Benn is my name. - I know. - Call me by that name. Looking for work? - I think I can, help Uncle Benn pull the flags up and down. - They pay me 12 pounds per month, and four and sex pence for every foot draft of every ship I bring safely through the heads. It's a responsible job. And I'm not looking for apprentices. - I'll do anything for you Uncle Benn! I can clear the footpath to the top of the hill Uncle Benn! Well what if I help wash and iron the flags then? Anything! - Ahoy! - Well anything Uncle Benn says. I, I only need food and a place where I can lay my head down. - You come from the forest? - Yes Uncle Benn. - So you can't row either. - Uh no, but I'll soon learn Uncle Benn! - Listen to him, hmm! I'll tell you again, I'm nobody's uncle, I don't want apprentices, and my name is John Benn. (wind whispering) (utensils clattering) - Eat, the house won't blow away. - Hmm. - More pumpkin? (chuckles) Anyone can see you're a woodcutter, there's no salt in your blood. - We're not woodcutters, we're beam makers. - Ah it's the same thing, bush is bush. Stay away from water it's not your place. - Uh-uh. Since I was small I wanted to work on the ships. - Mmm, mm, big shot. Eh, listen to you when a big storm gets you on the open sea my friend. - Does it often blow like this? - Uhn, often enough. If it blows like it's blowing now, it won't die down before it blows its three days through. But the storms bring me luck. (sniffs) They bring me all my extras. On a night like this, all the chickens on the ships drown in the coops on deck, (chuckles). After the storm they'll pay two shillings for a chicken and no argument! - Kaliel, can I work for you? - For food and a bed to sleep, you can begin tomorrow. (seabirds squawking) - Where are you girl? Where are you? (playful music) (giggling) (laughing) - No no (mumbles)! Put me down, put me down (laughs)! (mumbling) (laughing) (cheerful music) (chattering) (laughing) (Nina squealing) No I can't (laughs)! (waves crashing) (waves thundering) (pleasant music) Are you still struggling against your name? - (chuckles) No I got used to the idea of being a Van Rooyen. - You don't look like Pa, Lucas. - It was only this week, when I saw the sea that I began wondering. - What? - It's as if I've always known the sea. What if Ma had only guessed about me? What if I had been a foundling? My Pa could have been a seaman. - It's no use struggling, Lucas. You can't fight your own blood. - I'm not struggling against anything, I'm only asking, I want an answer. - Oh shut your beaks! - (chuckles) They don't hear you at all Nina. - Stupid things. (screeches) I hate you! Have you ever heard a seabird sing Lucas? They don't sing, they just rant and rave! - Nina... - Birds in the forest sing! There are Lories up at Coney Glen, did you know that? - I want to ask you a favor. - What? - Remember the days when I never split on you Nina. For all those days when I helped you stripping the bark off I want you just once to help me. - What? - I want you to go home and tell Pa I'm not returning. - I always knew that it would happen. He didn't want to be with us. - [Elias] Isn't there any coffee, Barta? - No, there's no coffee. - [Elias] Go and ask Aunt Molly for some. - I always knew our son's mind was somewhere else. - Your wasting your tears Barta, he'll come back. Even if I have to fetch him with the whip he'll come. Uh who are you packing this for? - It's Lucas's he told me to bring it. - He can come and get it himself! - Pa! - He can walk with his own two feet to come and get (clattering) it if he has the courage! (cup thumping) (sighing) - How long's she been gone? - Who? - You're sister. - It's almost a month. New seamen around here, when they climb off the ships they, they look for women. Is it always like that? (grunting) What happens to all the children born afterwards? - Hmm, my pa was a Norwegian seaman who docked here. A seaman on the clipper ships. My ma raised me without a husband. But some women can't keep their babies. - Then what? - Have you ever heard of foundlings? (waves crashing) (seabirds screeching) Did you catch any fish? - [Benjamin] No, nothing. But I collected some oysters. (thudding) (clanking) (rattling) - Uh, at least you got a lot of oysters. (water splashing) (mumbling) Tomorrow we must cut some bait. Mr. Horn wants some chickens too I hear. - Well tomorrow I'm going to the forest. I must go and look for my sister. - She's already back. - Says who? - Uh-huh, saw her at the point just now. - Why didn't you tell me? (cheerful music) Nina! - Lucas (sighs)! Oh (sighs)! I'm so glad to see you! - Where the devil have you been? - Went to see you two days ago, wanted to give you your clothes but nobody home. - But you've been back a whole week! - I did come to your place! - I was terribly worried about you. I thought you were going for a week, but you stayed away for three weeks! - Are you angry or what? - You weren't with them all the time, were you? - I was in the forest. - Alone? - Yeah. It's not the same anymore. All our paths are overgrown. My bottles are still there but they're filthy, full of worms. The birds have forgotten me too. - You must get over this wildness of yours! A grown up girl like you doesn't walk around in the forest for weeks on her own! - I'm talking to you about our place! - Everybody's worried to death about you, but you go to pay a visit to your bottles! Nina! Listen Nina, I'm talking to you! - Leave me alone Lucas you're just like Pa! (forlorn music) - Ma who's that sugar cake on the table for? Did you bake it? (sighs) Ma don't bake any more. Who's it for? - For Benjamin. - Ma you know he's not here. - It's his birthday today. - Well how do you know it's his birthday? You didn't give birth to him ma. - A black crow came and told me. (seabirds screeching) - Morning Mr. Benn! - Morning, thank you for the leg of pork. - It was a pleasure, Mr. Benn. - Can you row yet? - Yes, almost. - I see you work for Kaliel now. - Yes Mr. Benn. - You must watch out for him. - Why Mr. Benn, he's a good man? - With those eyes? - He can't help it if he squints. - Anyone can tell you still don't know the sea. No captain will take him on his ship, be sure. We believe you possess the evil eye if you squint. The one eye looks at the devil, and the other one, to the grave. - But he's a good oarsman, Mr Benn. - You must tell me the day you can row, and I'll give you his pair of oars. - (sighs) I don't want his pair, Mr. Benn. I want my own. - One day my ship will come, and I will sail all these oceans. - Who'd sign you up, with those two eyes of yours? - What are you still sulking about? Looking for trouble Lucas van Rooyen? I know about you. - Oh yeah? - You crawl before John Benn, you're looking for my job, that's what you're doing! And don't think I'm gonna forgive you for that leg of pork that you gave him, when I wasn't looking! - (chuckling) One day when I have my own ship Kaliel I'll make you Captain, you're eyes don't worry me. - I'll tell you what's biting you. Your sister is biting you. I can see what's happening. - Ha. - Yeah, laugh if you want to, (sweet music) I wasn't born yesterday. You walk around the house every night looking pathetic and angry. It's because of her. (footsteps thumping) Because you wish she was not your sister. - I'm sorry I fought with you a few days ago. (water splashing) (sighs) I don't know what's the matter with me. (waves crashing) (seabirds screeching) (water splashing) Need any help? - I'm almost finished. - There was someone in town who was looking for you. - Who was he? - Young man, son of Mr. Petrus. They've been looking for you for months. - So? - Hmm, he wanted to know about Benjamin Komoetie of the Lange Kloof. It's about hmm, David, or someone? David is dead. - David... - Who is David? Lucas? - David. He was my brother. - I'm very tired Fiela. - Selling you must walk three times around the back now, and you still haven't completed the first round! Go, move it! Kitty, go and watch the pumpkin on the stove! - Fiela! Sss, someone's coming up the road to us. - Yeah Selling just keep on going. Kitty, the pumpkin! - [Selling] Can't I just rest for a little while? - [Fiela] No Selling, the doctor said walk, so walk! - Fiela, (pants), that man is coming this way Fiela. - Yeah Selling now you just go on walking and don't stop. Uh, just what are you looking at? Why don't you go sit on your eggs, huh? One, two, three... (talons pounding) (footsteps scuffling) - [Selling] Hey Benjamin, B-Benjamin! - Pa! - Benjamin! - Pa. - Benjamin. - Lord this cannot be true. (poignant music) It is a white man. It is a grown man. Can it really be him? - Fiela! - It's not true. It's not true. (suspenseful music) (happy music) - Oh Momma! - Benjamin! Oh (sighs)! Oh! (lips smacking) (Fiela weeping) - [Benjamin] Momma! - Kitty come, let's get a fire going! Then you go to the chicken coop and, see if you can find us about, 12 eggs there! Oh, thank the lord, thank the lord (mumbles). - Is Pa feeling better now? - Yeah, yeah, - (mumbles) just look at his health! - much better. - Good, I'll put you on the bed to rest. (mumbling) (groaning) (mumbling) - [Fiela] I want enough dough for a sugar cake. (grunting) - There. - Selling, how are you feeling now? (sighing) Ah, poor man. Kitty, what has happened to those eggs I asked you for? Oh I must go and see if there's enough flour for a cake. Kitty if there's more than (mumbles)... - Ma, (sighs), Ma will never change, never change. - No Ma hasn't changed. I see the ostriches are pulling their weight as well. - [Fiela] (mumbles) around the house, Kitty! - Ma's doing well, (pants). - (mumbling) did you hear me? - We now have 12 - Hurry up! - breeding pair. - Really? - That's right. - Will you hurry! - And last year she bought Lagan's land right out from under them! (chuckling) (wheezing) Yeah, the only bad luck for us was, what happened to David. - Oh yeah. Just heard about David this week. - One of those button spiders bit him. He was (sighs), he was bitten on one of his fingers. - And Tullie, pa? - Tullie's now working for the master, Petrus. But we uh, very worried about Tullie. - Why's that pa? - He, he loves his bottle. - Benjamin? Come on, you must get out of those rags and burn them right away! - Um ma... - Selling are you feeling better now? - Uh-hmm... - Come, come my child, come! Here's a whole bundle of old (Selling chuckling) clothes, here trousers and things of David what will fit you! Ah Benjamin, you know we must let Master Petrus know so that they can come and see you. Kitty, when are you going to bring those eggs? (insects chittering) (birds chirping) - I hear your Lucas has walked off. - I want to buy a heavy rifle right away! To shoot elephants! (sighing) - I know what you want to know. - Remember you used to talk about the things the old timers always rubbed on themselves? - It'll cost you six sweet potatoes. - Right. - For half the remedy. 10 sweet potatoes, for the whole rem-- - Right, 10 potatoes. - All right. Can I sit? It works like this now. - Uh-huh. - First, you take off all your clothes. - Uh-hmm. - And then you rub into your skin some bruised boo-boo. (mumbling) And then, then you go off and you look for the dung of an elephant, and you mix it with a little mud. More elephant dung than mud. - More elephant dung than mud. - And you rub yourself all over, from your head to your toes with that, till only your two eyes show! (birds chirping) (elephants rumbling) (tense music) (elephants rumbling) (clicking) (gun firing) (elephants roaring) (rustling) (elephants roaring) (Elias grunting) (Elias mumbling) - Ah, uh, uh, uh... (grunting) (limbs rustling) (elephant growling) (limb cracking) Help, help! (cracking) (elephant roaring) (Elias screaming) (Elias whimpering) (cracking) (thudding) (trumpeting) (rustling) (insects chittering) - Lord, I want to say something and I don't know how, I'm sort of um, I just want to say Lord, that I forgive the Van Rooyens all their sins Lord and, amen. (insects chittering) (scraping) (water splashing) (birds chirping) (patting) Hey, here's your coffee! Be careful you don't fall off that thing, that ladder isn't what it used to be you know. - Oh thank you ma. (poignant music) (creek splashing) (birds chirping) (water splashing) (insects chittering) - Doesn't he look absent minded to you? He's here but, it's as if his mind is somewhere else. - If only they could have kept their claws off of him then. He was my child till they came and buggered up everything. They just came and confused him Selling, that's what they did. - Tell him about the Lagan's land that you put in his name. - I have no right to your land, Ma. - My child, here lies David dead today. Tullie stays drunk. For Kitty and Emma I put something aside in the box. - Yes but-- - Now if Tullie let's go of the drink I'll give him (mumbles). But the land I bought from Lagan's is yours. - Heh, I just cannot Ma. - I want you to be well to do the day they say behind your back a colored woman brought you up. - I'm not looking for land, I'm looking for something else. - Speak, let me hear. - Is it true I'm a Van Rooyen Ma, or isn't it? - Do you feel like a Van Rooyen? - No Ma. - Your name was written in our Bible the day I found you. Benjamin Komoetie, in pencil I wrote it. Behind the mountain they wrote another name in the book of the government, Lucas van Rooyen. In ink. Ink will not erase. - What's on paper is not important, but who am I, really? - The only thing that really counts, is what's written in your heart, that's all. - I know I'm your child, but-- - No buts Benjamin. (sighing) (poignant music) - There's something you don't know, Ma. I fell in love with my sister. - Your sister? - I mean Nina van Rooyen. - But-- - No buts Ma. It just happened, I didn't look for it. - If she is your sister Benjamin, blood would have stopped blood anyway. What does she say? - She doesn't know I'm, I'm just a brother to her. Just Lucas van Rooyen, that's it. - There's just one person who can free you from that name. One person, in this whole wide world. (melancholy music) (birds chirping) - Hello Ma. - Lucas! (sighs) I'm so glad you're back! We sent for you, but, but Nina told us you'd left, on a ship! (chuckling) Did you hear about Pa? - No Ma, what about Pa? - Those elephants trampled him! Yeah, he had to crawl from Grumper River! Took him two days! - Hello Pa. - Dog. - Wait now Elias, Lucas didn't know you got hurt. - Dog. - And his rifle was all flattened! - Where were you all this time? - In the Lange Kloof Pa. - With her? - Yes Momma. - You hang around with these god-damned coloreds! And me you leave here to die! - This is for you. - What is it? - It's meat. - Meat? - It's sheep's meat. - Elias, it's meat! - Fiela Komoetie sends it to you. (scraping) (birds chirping) Heh... - [Elias] You're not sawing it straight Lucas! - I'll only saw, till this load's finished, then I'll go again. - You're like a (mumbles) dog. - It would have been better if you'd stayed on this scaffold and left the elephants alone! - I'll shoot all the bastards in the forest! - How are you gonna do that with a flattened rifle? - Ma says you got 30 pounds in that sack. (thumping) - I'll leave it all here, for Ma, not for a rifle. - Are there any clothes you want washed? - Ma should know because you've been going through my things. (sighing) Ma. - I just wanted to see. Where did you get all those things? - Some of it I worked for. The rest I got from Fiela Komoetie. Ma, Ma I want to talk to you. - I got to go wash your pa. - I'll leave money for you under the lamp. - Are you going? - Yes. Before I go you must tell me something first. - But-- - No Ma, you can't escape this time! - Your pa needs me Lucas! - Pa can wait! - Lucas let go of me! - Ma! - What's the matter with you? - Ma, look me in my two eyes and tell me whether I'm your child or not! (tense music) Answer me Ma! Is it true I'm your child or isn't it? - What kind of question is that? - Is it true that I'm Lucas? - I don't know how you can talk to me like this! - Ma I want to know the truth no matter what it is! Is Lucas standing here or someone else? - You are Lucas, yes, in front of the magistrate I swore it, and I swear it and swear it you are Lucas! (dramatic music) (seabirds screeching) - I heard uh, Mr. Benn's looking for me. - [John] Where were you all this time? - With my family, in the Lange Kloof. - I thought you said your family lived in the forest? Did you hear about Kaliel September? - I haven't been to see him yet. - He left with bag and baggage, a ship took him. - With his squint eyes? - Hmm, the squint eye he had patched up with a rag. (chuckling) He left word that you can have his shack. You can have his pair of oars too, if you want them. Come and row for me in the pilot boat. (seabirds screeching) (waves crashing) (clapping) - Eh... Nina! I know it's you! (chuckling) - I never see you! - John Benn keeps us busy. - Day and night? (pensive music) - Not really. (poignant music) (shell clacking) (waves crashing) (seabirds screeching) - Since you came back you've changed. Did anything happen? - No. - But you never say anything! Lucas, did I do something? - You did nothing wrong. - Well if you want I'll go away. - It's just, I, I don't think we should see so much of each other Nina. - What do you mean? - Please don't misunderstand me. - What do you mean? - I don't want to chase you away. - Very well Lucas van Rooyen, take your pilot boat and go drown yourself, it's all you care about anyway! - You don't give me a chance Nina! - (mumbles) you a little, I used to think you were a lot better and certainly smarter than Willum and Christofle, now I see you're just as idiotic as your two brothers! - You row like a (patrons chattering) seaman Van Rooyen. - [Benjamin] Hmm. - But I don't understand you. For months you whined that you wanted to come and row. And now that you have the work, your eyes grow older every day. - It's not the work Mr.-- - Well what is it then? - I love the work. - You've been like this since you came back from the Lange Kloof, hmm. Is your family there? - Yes. - But you told me you come from the forest. (sighing) Who are you really? - I'm Lucas van Rooyen. - You're hiding something. Pride is a good thing, Van Rooyen, but you are sitting there growing old before my eyes. Pride, Van Rooyen, can make a man bitter. - I don't feel proud or bitter or any of that. I feel nothing. - That means you are dead, Van Rooyen. - Maybe I am. - Where's Mr. Benn? Mr. Benn! There's a ship, down by the heads! He's trying to bring her through himself! - In this weather? - She's past Blight Rock! - Is the man mad or what? (chairs clattering) Where are my rowers? (tense music) (waves crashing) Ahoy, hey! (screaming) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (screaming) (waves thundering) - [Man] Help! (tense music) (faint chattering) (water splashing) (dramatic music) - Look, there's another one there! Come on grab my oar, grab my oar! (wooden creaking) (sorrowful music) (shouting) (water splashing) (wind howling) (gasping) (panting) (waves thundering) (wind howling) (panting) - Lucas? - Nina. I saw a man, I saw him die. - Oh! (gasping) It's all right! It's all right! It's all right... (melancholy music) (mumbling) Mmm... Mmm-hmm, oh... (moaning) Oh, oh! (lips smacking) (sharp inhaling) (romantic music) (Nina gasping) (birds screeching) (waves crashing) - [Benjamin] Nina I'm going back to the forest. - Why? - I think Ma's lying to me. - [Nina] Be careful Lucas. Take care. (birds chirping) - Now that Willum and Christofle are helping with the beams it's getting better, but I won't be able to lift an ax again, my hand's still numb, my leg won't take one step. Barta, why are you sitting like that? Is there any coffee? - Elias. - But I have to accept my fate I said, look at them working! But I'll take it like a man. I swear this leg of mine won't grow back in the right place. Ah you don't know what I've been through. - Elias. - And look at this arm, look here, I can't lift it up. I tell you Ma, I tell you-- - Ma doesn't look well Pa. - What's going on? - I don't feel so well. - Your ma's always sick these days, every now and then she's short of breath. - Elias. - Pa, Ma's speaking. - What is it Barta? - I took the wrong child that Friday. - What are you talking about? (forlorn music) - It wasn't Lucas it was another child. - Barta! - I found out when it was much too late! - God woman, you're crazy! - He came to me last time, and I lied. He's not our Lucas! - Barta, you picked him out right away, in front of the magistrate! - Hmm... I just can't bear it any longer Elias. The burden's too heavy for me. The tall man with him. That brought the child to the magistrate that day. He stood behind me, and before I went to the magistrate inside, he whispered, and said, "The one that's wearing the blue shirt." I was afraid, muddled. They pushed me into the room before the magistrate. I, I saw him there, in the middle, the boy with the blue shirt. (whimpering) (weeping) - Barta, what are you saying? (dramatic music) - One man! One single god damned bastard of a man with a black suit! Just spoke a single sentence and played god to make Benjamin Komoetie into Lucas van Rooyen of white parents! Like that! Each beam you forced me to make, every day I tried to breath in this forest, every time that you bashed my body for no reason. And each night, every dark night in my room I lay on, my bed and longed for my ma and cried for her. All these things I'm gonna force down his throat the day I lay my hands on him! (waves crashing) (seabirds screeching) Morning Mr. Benn! - Ah, it's you. - Yes I'm back, as you can see. - Hmm, you look better, Van Rooyen. - It isn't Van Rooyen, Mr. Benn, my name is Benjamin Komoetie. - A new name? - No Mr. Benn it's my old name, Van Rooyen was just a borrowed name. - Hmm, Komoetie. Honorable name. An old Hottentot name if I'm not mistaken. - That's right. - So, go tell Joop Stoep that you've returned. - They say Kaliel's returned Mr. Benn. They took him to the Cape and threw him off the ship they say! (chuckling) He'd better take his oars back Mr. Benn, I'll return to the Lange Kloof now, to farm my land. - I have never understood you. - I didn't either, not until yesterday. (poignant music) (waves crashing) Nina! Nina! Nina! - Lucas! - [Benjamin] I love you! I love you! - I can't hear! - I am not your brother! - Who are you then! - I'm Fiela's child! (dramatic music) (pleasant music) (cheerful music) - Ma, Ma! - [Fiela] What is it? - Somebody's coming! - But who on Earth could that be? - [Kitty] I think it's Benjamin! - [Fiela] Oh, oh! Selling, Selling! (mumbling) Come, come! (laughs) Oh... - [Girl] Mom! (playful music) (majestic music)
