Good day, Iqbal. We are five days away from Eid. The traffic at Cikarang Utama entrance is flowing smoothly, even empty at times. No sign of a traffic jam so far. I could see that there were four to five cars, tops, lining up to pass the entrance of Cikarang Utama from Jakarta, heading to West and Central Java or towards Cikampek area. That being said, at eight o'clock this morning the police did set up this section to be a one-way route, so vehicles coming up before KM 28 were detoured to exit at Cikarang Barat 3, to then enter again. Also, at 11:15, the police... Young listeners, it's Saturday, June 9th, 2018. Once again, I'm going to inform you about the newest data of the homecoming this afternoon. Be careful on the way. Reaching your destination is the most important thing. Compared to last year, there is a 30% decline in the accident incident rate on the road during the homecoming period this year. In 2017, reports showed more than 20,000 incidents that resulted in the death of more than 600 people. In 2018, more than 19,000 incidents were reported, with more than 400 casualties. Seventy percent of traffic accidents are still... Where have you been? I was there, all along. I have circled around twice. You were not there. I was standing there, you just didn't see me. No, if you had been there, I would have seen you. I was literally there! You couldn't see me behind the crowd, I guess. No way. I paid close attention, really. My goodness. And why was it so hard to reach you on the phone? I missed it, my phone was put on Silent. Yes, Mom. Are you on the way? Since this morning. It's been four hours. Are you stuck in traffic? Well, it's homecoming after all. Okay. Hey, Da. It's fine, I can go around again. My fault. Please take care. Yes, Ma. - I want this! - No! No. Oh, okay. Yes. Ah, I see. I'll call you back. Welcome. Moreover, there have been 175,000 travelers in this Pasar Senen station. All of them went in and out of the station, which could see up to 25,000 travelers in a day. How long are we going to do this for? Don't you want to find someone that can give you what you want? What are you saying? Your coworker, perhaps? What do you mean? There's no one else. It's the holy month, you cannot lie. Who's lying? Now let me ask you this, who was the one who asked for some space? It was you, all right? There is no one else, Da. So put your imaginations to rest. Why don't you just tell your family, about what's wrong with me? That's impossible. Is forgiving me not an option? Hello. Da, Aida! Da, Da. Turn, Da! Turn! Aida, turn now! Stop! Da! Turn, Da! What did you hit? How many of them, Da? Da. Why don't you calm me down first instead of bombarding me with questions! Da. Aida. Get in, there's someone. Get in the car, someone's coming. Let's turn around first. Turn around. What for? What if something happened to that person? Keep going. Stop here. Da. Aida! Is it an accident? Well... Where is he? What did he get hit by? Da, stop. Let's go back to the car. Why did you get out of the car? I... I hit someone. Let's follow them. There, just park there. POLYCLINIC On behalf of Mr. Opi. Excuse me. - The one that just came in. - Yes? Is he the victim of the accident? There's a lot of accidents. It's the homecoming time of the year. The motorcycle, motorcycle accident! Sorry, are you related to the patient? - Nurse. - Yes? We'll just wait over there. Excuse us. - Please. - Come on, Da. Da, let's go. Do not panic. Wait over there. Sit down. Let me find out, okay? - You should wait in the car. Let's move! - What happened to the man? They're taking care of him. Hopefully nothing serious. Let's move, Da. Get in. You wait here in the car, okay? Here, hold the key. I have to tell Mom. Okay. POLYCLINIC Miss. Yes? What happened to Sugeng, the one that was in the motorcycle accident? Da, Da. Aida. Open the door, Da. Da. He's dead, Da. He passed away. Da. Aida. Da. Aida. EMERGENCY ROOM - Miss... - Yes? The victim... Da. Let me make a quick call. The accident. Sugeng? I'm his wife. Nurse, nurse! - The patient, Sugeng. I'm his wife. - Please follow me. We have done the best we could, ma'am. We're really sorry, but God has a different plan. We couldn't save Mr. Sugeng's life. He passed away. I'm sorry, ma'am. Stay strong. We'll take care of the administration. Please excuse me. EMERGENCY ROOM I did it. Nurse, nurse! You killed Sugeng! Miss, please. Nurse, please hold her! Sis! They killed Sugeng, they. - Sugeng is dead now. - Sit, sit down, San. - Good evening. - Evening. How did it happen? Were you the one driving, sir? Ma'am! You shouldn't have escaped! My friend died because you hit him from behind. You lost it and hit the gas pedal instead. He was trapped under the car. You were not there. That was an accident. I was talking to her, not you. I'm her husband! I'm responsible for everything! That's enough. Let's talk. So irritating. No matter how you put it, you're in the wrong here. Well, I'll try to help you later. - Where's his village? - About one hour away, sir. So unfortunate. - He was so close to home. - Right, sir. What do you think? Shold we go ahead and process it now? - Poor her. - Yeah. What a pity. It was the first time the husband wanted to go home, in five years. - What? Five years? - He was working abroad. Such a pity. His wife is so young. Do you know his wife? No, no. Of course not. She hardly goes out of the house. Yeah, that's true. Mom! Yes. Sir, can we talk for a second? Da. My name is Tarto, the chief in this village. Firman. - And ma'am, I'm Tarto. - Aida. And this is Ade, a relative of Sugeng's parents. - Ade. - Aida. Sapto, Sugeng's relative. - Sapto. - Aida. Wan, wan! And this is Irwan, Sugeng's best friend. Firman. - The police is here. - Okay. Sir. I would like to ask, how are we going to cover the burial fees? Some villagers came to help out earlier, before you came. I have some. We only have this much. We didn't get a chance to take more cash. Okay. Thank you, sir. But this is only to cover the burial, and other fees. Here's the thing, sir, ma'am. The late Sugeng is my nephew. That's why they asked me to take care of this. The police has spoken to us. We want a peaceful resolution, right? So, how are we going to solve this? Sorry, Mr. Ade and Mr. Tarto. Why don't we continue this talk after the burial? Ah, okay. How about this. After we break the fast, please do come over to the hall. We can discuss what's best for this situation. It doesn't look good that you both came here abruptly while the family is mourning. As a respresentative of this village. I can only mediate. So everyone can feel at ease. Both of you can then continue your journey back home peacefully. That's what I mean. Okay? Okay, then. Please excuse us. To, De, let's go. - Mas. Mbak. - Please. Thank you. What are you doing here? Horrible woman! You brought bad luck to our family. Get out of here, you, piece of shit! Get out! Get out! You brought bad luck to our family. Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Sir, where's Santi? She's at home, ma'am. Resting. Okay, sir and ma'am, so here is the problem. Just because you paid for the hospital fees, it doesn't mean that we are done here. As a representative of the family. I want everything to be clear. The same thing happened last year, sir, ma'am. It was the village next to ours. We were the ones taking care of things. Sir, can I ask you a question? Why did you let your wife drive? Is there a problem with that? What the hell. Sir, let's continue. Let's finish this. See. Brushing it off so easily. This is someone's life we're talking about! I am aware of that. I'm here to have a discussion. Okay, that's enough. Let's settle this, sir. After talking to the family, they are asking for 30 million. We don't have that kind of money, sir. Last year, the amount was exactly the same, sir. And that is also for the family left behind, sir. But we don't have that much, sir. Besides, we have paid for the hospital fees. The hospital fees was the problem of yesterday, sir. If he had come out alive. But he is now, in fact, dead. Yes, I know. Or you can borrow some money from a friend. I can't do that. Thirty million is a lot. Sir, ma'am. Take a look at this village, we have nothing. If a family loses the breadwinner, they are left helpless. Put it this way. You still want to continue your journey, don't you? Still want to go home? You have to settle this problem. If not, you cannot leave the village. Is that a threat? - Then, settle! - I'm trying to! You drive a car. And yet you said you have no money. Watch your mouth! So what? I came here politely. I want to take care of everything. I am trying to be responsible. - Right? - Of course. I hope it will be cleared soon. Just don't be afraid. Just get this over with. Do what they want. After all, it cost someone's life. So I will come back tomorrow. Until this is settled. - What's this? - For your transport. I'll give you more tomorrow. If you help me. In that case. I'll help you out tomorrow. - Mo? - Yes, sir. - What do we have tomorrow? - Tomorrow is a slow day, sir, but... - It's all right, I'll explain. - Yes, sir. - So how about tomorrow, sir? - Well, I'll help you. Just save my number. Excuse me. Santi? Excuse me. Do you know where Santi is? At the back, in the field. Thank you. Santi? San? San. San! Can I help you with anything? Do you want some money? I can give it to you now. I'd rather give it to you than to those people. I am not asking for anything, ma'am. Let them deal with it. Besides, why are you still here? San. I am really sorry. San, Santi. Please, San. Listen to me. Santi, I... San! Santi! Santi! I asked him to come back home. He didn't use to. But this year he had to come home. If you had not been there, everything would have been fine. Now I don't know what to say to the villagers here. Where are they? They are not picking up. Mr. Firman. Just a second, sir. Oh, my goodness. Are they not reachable? They didn't pick up. They didn't reply to my texts either. They're still on a call. Sir, we're about to start. Yes, sir. Call them. I gave him some money yesterday. It's locked. Zero, eight, one, eight. Sir, can we wait for a moment? We're waiting for the police. He's not here yet. Oh, it's okay. Let's just start. He might come later in the day. Then who's gonna be the mediator? All of us, here. It's okay. Come on, let's get in. Please. It's the importance of... Come, get inside. Please, get inside. Well, it's... Mr. Firman. Where's the money, sir? Hey. Have they got it? It's done. They should have it. Nobody picks up. Just a second, sir. Sir. Can we wait for the police to come here? He already left it up to us. Chill, just relax. Is everybody here? Where's Agus? I don't know. Oh, no. Whenever we have something to do, he is always absent. Santi. Santi. Ti, we're about to settle the money. But you're supposed to stay home, Ti. Mr. Ade, I've never seen you pay us a visit. You guys are all the same. When there's money involved, you come like ants swarming around sugar. I want to join them, leaving for Jakarta. How? Ke Jakarta? What? Ma'am, what did you offer her? We offered her nothing, sir. Santi! Your husband just passed away, Ti. You are not supposed to leave the house. Who's going to take care of Sugeng's grave, then? This is out of line. This is the thing, Ti. You are not allowed to leave this place. Sir. This woman is the wife. Of course she has a say. Let me explain, sir. All of us here is also Sugeng's family. That's what you said. What did you say? What did you say? She said it herself! She said it herself! - Enough. - Sir, please accept this. This is not even half! Do not lose yourself chasing money, you guys. - Sir, watch your mouth! - Sir, let me kick his ass! - He has no manners, sir! - So what? Enough. Sir, sir, please just accept this. I will get the rest from the ATM. I'll wait until sunset. Let's go! I'll crush you. Gendis! Gendis! Gendis! Come on! - Let's get out of here! - I don't wanna go, Mom. Do as I say. Mother. Santi, where are you going? I'm leaving. But where? Why is Sugeng not home yet? It's almost Eid al-Fitr now. He is no longer coming home. - You stay here and take care, alright? - All right. I don't wanna go. - I don't want to. - Let's go. San. Wait, San, where are you going? San, hey! What did you tell her, ma'am? Mr. Tarto! Mr. Ade! San, Santi! Santi! San. Open it, San! San. Santi! Santi! San. Santi! San! Santi! San! Gendis, it's okay, all right. You'll make new friends. Cheer up. Where are we heading? Turn left here, sir. Sorry, sir, turn right this way. sir. Isn't the exit on the left, that way? Yes, but I want to pick up my friend who wants to join us. Take a U-turn, please. Okay. - Sir, sir. - Yes? Please open the door, sir. - What's the matter, ma'am? - San. San. Hey. Where is it again? I don't remember. The place with the cows? Be quick, get out quickly. Yes. Where are we going, ma'am? Straight after this slight climb, it will be on the right. It's here. Stop, sir! Right here. Sir, can you please open the door, sir? Come, quick! Quick! All right, sir. We're ready to go now. Come, Da. Come here. Where are we actually heading to? They keep on quarrelling in this holy month. - She asked to be dropped at a place. - Where? I don't know, she said it's not far from here. Are we going straight to Jakarta? Then what is he doing in our car? No, we're going to their place first. Then we'll leave for Jakarta. What if they harm us? - Impossible. - Why is it impossible? All he knows is they're coming to our place, then we'll leave for Jakarta after. San, but what if they suddenly abandon us? In that case, we can drop them at the terminal. - That's it, we're done. - I promised Santi. That's just impossible, Da. Tonight is the last prayer's night. But it's true that they'll help me find a job, right? Yes. Okay. To make it easier. Let me tell them that we can only drop them at the terminal. I'll drop her off. I promised. Hey, listeners! Because tonight is Takbiran and tomorrow is Eid al-Fitr, today's theme is forgiveness. I want to ask all of you, have you ever done something unforgivable? Or maybe you can't forgive others because it involves something that's really important to you? Eid al-Fitr is a time for forgiveness. But would it be enough to apologize on Eid al-Fitr? Sir, sir. Can we stop here? I need to go to the restroom. Oh, okay. Me too. This time, let's talk. We'll discuss it. What unforgivable thing has someone ever done to you? Or maybe that you've done. Maybe that's it. - Motorcycle taxi! - Motorcycle taxi! Let's go, ma'am! Motorcycle taxi! - Motorcycle taxi! - Motorcycle taxi! Sir! Motorcycle taxi! Want to go, ma'am? - Motorcycle taxi! - Want to go somewhere, ma'am? - Motorcycle taxi! - Gus! - The car is gone! Where is it? - I don't know. - Ma'am! - Let's go! What happened, ma'am? Nothing, it's okay. Gendis. Gendis, come here. It's okay, San. Let her stay here with me. I think she was bored. Gendis, how old are you? Eight. - Are you in school? - Yes. - What grade are you in? - First. Where is your kid, ma'am? I don't have one. I don't have one. I can't have one, love. Why can't you have one? Well, God doesn't give me any. Do you pray? Yes, I do. He will give you one. I'm still on the way. Yeah. Yes, I did. I had dinner. I want to celebrate Eid with my family. Let me call you later. Yeah. Oh, talk to you later. Yeah, I have to drive. Yeah. Okay. Where are the others? Praying. - I'm gonna go pray too. Okay? - Okay. - Da. - What? Are you okay? Where were you, Da? Don't answer it. It's Ma. Don't answer. We won't make it tomorrow. We still can make it by tomorrow, Da. I don't want to. Where are we actually going? - Da. - Where are we going, San? You promised. Drop them off. Then we're going home to Mom's. - Right? - I don't want to. Oh, my goodness. Drop us where, sir? Just a second, sir. Da, what's wrong with you? San. What gives? Mom, where are we going? Just a moment, Gendis. We'll be there soon. Where are we going, really? - We're going home. - Home? Where? - To my mother's house. - To your mother's house? Why are you taking me? I don't want to. You're lying to me. I'm tired doing this behind everybody's back. If I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have come with me. Why did you have to lie? You come with me now to my mother's house. Sir, ma'am, we have settled everything back at your village. Now we have to hurry so we can celebrate Eid tomorrow. Sorry, we'll have to drop you off here. - What are you doing? - What's wrong, Da? But, Mrs. Aida has promised to take me home. So everybody else knows? Gus. - Agus. - Enough, enough. Enough! - How could you? - How could I, what? - We have settled everything! - Do not shout, there's a kid here! What now! We have no business with them anymore. - Gus! - What! Why did you lie to me? Saying he will help me get a job. I had high hopes, you know, leaving the village. I feel ashamed, San! We will go to Jakarta. But now we go to my mother's house first. I don't want to! - Gus! - What? I'm pregnant, Gus. I've told you. Give them money, let them go on their own. That easy, huh? Do you think if you have money, all problems are sorted? That's not what I meant. How dare you! Gus! Gus! Gendis! Gendis! - Gendis, come, follow me. - No, I want to stay here. - Hey, Santi. Wait. - We'll just go from here. - Santi! - Come on. Da, let them. - Just let them be. - Get off of me! Aida! Aida! I say, stop! Stop! Aida! Let them go! We still have somewhere to be. Come on, get in! Why do you have to lie to me? Lie about what? Lastri. Stop imagining stuff. There's nothing between me and Lastri. - It's on the phone. - What phone? The phone that keeps ringing. That you pick up straight away as soon as it rings, no matter if I was there or not. Firman. Now let me ask you. Who left me? - Who left the house? - It's me. I left because you changed. You changed since you knew I can't get pregnant. - That again. - Yes, that again! What, do you think this is a small problem? No, right? That is exactly our problem, Firman! I left so I can have some space, some time to think on my own. To ask God why I cannot give you children. To ask why. I left so you can also think, do I deserve to be treated like this? Why? Why has there got to be someone else? Answer me! Answer me, look at me! What? My family. What about them? Go on. They have given permission if... I want to get another wife. Shit! Da! Aida! Aida! Leaving again! Shit! Santi! Aida! Oh. Take care. Please rate this subtitle at %url% Help other users to choose the best subtitles
