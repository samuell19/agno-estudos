Naomi Murdoch, that's me. Not quite at the bottom of the bill yet and not quite at the end of my rope. But I can't say I'm making an impression on audiences these days. Not that I ever made much anyway. But now with the season over and the heat of the summer coming... the air in these broken-down theatres is even staler than usual. And, brother, there's not much to look forward to. Well, I guess some people might say maybe I asked for it. Boy, that audience is like ice out there tonight. These hicks wouldn't get off their hands for Lillian Russell. Here's some mail for you. Well, I started out holding the hoops for Miller's Wonder Dogs. - I guess I can always go back to it. - For Pete's sake, Naomi. You're too classy for vaudeville. You ought to go back to legit. Yeah, they loved me in Detroit. There's real prestige in legit. New parts all the time. You don't have to worry about getting old. What's the matter, honey? You look like you saw a ghost. - No. - Bad news? Well, it's a laugh, that's all. - "Dearest mother." - I told you it was a laugh. "I don't know if you ever think of me, but I think of you. "I'm graduating from high school this year and I'm in the senior play on May 20. "I suppose this doesn't sound much to a great star like you." Go ahead. "And I know your career must keep you very busy." Gets funnier, doesn't it? "But there's only one present I would like and that is to have you there. "Your adoring, Lily." You never said... That I had a kid? I've got three. Two girls and a boy. And I walked out on them. My husband, too. 1900, it wasn't going to be a Happy New Year for me, it was going to be a happy new century. Not much to be proud of, is it? And you haven't seen them in all these years? I had a reason. Lots of reasons. You should have seen me trying to be a wife of a schoolteacher back there in the great big town of Riverdale, Wisconsin. I don't think the town approved of me. After a while, he didn't either. He always said I'd wind up disgracing him and the kids. - I guess, maybe I did. - Another man? I pulled out before there was a scandal that would have... I guess I did the right thing. There's somebody back there who lets me know how they're doing. She says they're doing just fine. Sure be fun to go up there and see how they all look. The catch is they'd see me, the great big star. I'm supposed to be in Europe doing Shakespeare. - Is that so? - That's my story and I'm stuck with it. - It'll be great going back. You gotta, Naomi. - Oh, Belle. The kid's counting on it. They don't have to know how you're doing. Let your hair go back to natural. Act real classy. Why, you'd be their idea of a perfect lady and a big star. - I've done it on the stage. - Do you need a few bucks? No, I've got enough for a quick trip, what I saved to see me through the summer. I could get a couple of outfits and... Oh, sure, what do I need with a bank account? Something will turn up before August. Something always does. - Belle, it would be fun. - Yeah. Oh, I never thought I'd see that town of Riverdale, Wisconsin again. What a burn. What a burn. NAOMI: I'll bet it isn't changed a bit. Population must still be under 5,000. Not a new building on the town square since I left and where a buggy ride in the country is a big thrill. The same solid white frame houses in the residential district, the feel of the wind in the dusty streets. The lawns the husbands were so proud of. And those carriage steps. Golly! I wonder if the old granite one in front of the house is still there with "Murdoch" chiselled in it. - I?ll see you later, Russ. - What's your hurry? Well, look. I've got so many things to take care of today. Lily's play... - For Pete's sake. - And the party tonight. Poor Dad's so busy with graduation week, he's no help. And if I didn't look after Dad and Ted and Lily, who would? Well, I just want you to look after me, too. I'm sorry, Russ, if I don't meet with your approval. Wait a minute, Joyce. This is me, your fianc?, remember? - Now, don't go away peeved. - I'm not peeved. All right, then. - Shall we scandalise the neighbours? - Russ, really! - Thanks for bringing me home. - You're welcome. Lily! You can find me, dear sister, in the scullery. Lily, come upstairs so I can finish your costume. Everything's here, Lena. The paper baskets are on top so be careful. - All right. - It's not a costume, it's a gown. And is it a daisy! Just put one pecan and one almond in each basket. You can fill them up with the cheap ones. How many times must I tell you, one doesn't eat honey without bread. What if one doesn't care for bread? - That's not the point. Is Ted home? - Uptown someplace. You shouldn't have your feet up like that. It's not ladylike. - Anna Held even smokes cigars... - You're not Anna Held yet, young lady. - Oh! Did you buy the sash? - Well, of course I did. Would I forget the most important accessory of all? Lt's really divine, isn't it, Lena? The most heavenly cyclamen. - It's pink. - Come on, Lily, we've got a lot to do. I?ll be there in just a little minute. Lena, is it all going to be... wasted? What's wasted? Well, this evening. My performance. All my preparations. Oh, Lily, we sent the letter to that agency in Chicago. That's all we could do. If your mother doesn't come, don't be too disappointed, will you? Well, what else could I be? If she were here tonight, my performance would be like Mr Halley's comet streaking across the autumn sky. If she wouldn't come back for this, I suppose she'll never come back. Maybe she will, maybe she won't. Who can figure her? Well, why should she come back? She was smart to get out. Maybe she was smart, maybe she wasn't at all. And I'm just like her. I won't stay put here either. "Either". Who could endure this silly town with all the silly little people? Thank you! - Not you, Lena, you understand me. - JOYCE: Lily, are you coming? I?ll be there in a minute, I told you. They're not going to bury me in this provincial burg. Someday, somehow, Lily Murdoch is going to give her talent to the world. Miss Harper told Daddy I was the best drama student at Riverdale High. Come in. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Come in, I'm all through with Henry. If I know Colonel Underwood, he's just beginning with me. Just so you don't start teaching that progressive nonsense they're spouting in Washington. See? A principal gets his knuckles rapped for being too progressive or he gets criticised for not being modern enough. I hope the other councilmen don't give me as much trouble as you. You just satisfy me, Henry, you'll find being superintendent of schools no trouble. Happy to recommend you. You've done a fine job. - Thank you. - Goodbye, Miss Harper. Goodbye, Colonel Underwood. Oh, Henry. - Finally, after all these years. - After all these years. You know what a help you've been to me, don't you, Sara? I'm very glad if I have been. If you ever decide to stop school teaching... you're gonna make somebody a very wonderful wife. Thank you, Henry. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) Well... You will be on time tonight, won't you? The curtain can't go up until you arrive. We can trust Joyce to see that Ted and I are politely early and properly combed. CONDUCTOR: Riverdale, next stop. Riverdale. Riverdale, next stop. Riverdale. (WHISTLING) What a spiffy. - Someone meeting you, ma'am? - No, I'm not expected. - Stopping at Hathaway's Hotel? - Yes, the hotel. - There's still only one, isn't there? - CONDUCTOR: All aboard! Say, that's Naomi! Naomi Murdoch. At you! Won't the ladies be talking tonight. Hey, I think I?ll take a walk. Hot patootie! Ted, you snookered me into a bad bet. If you're never gonna miss, I?ll be buying root beers rest of the summer. You teach me too good, Dutch. Say, Dutch, by jimminy, I don't mind waiting on myself and figuring out how much I owe, but would it be too much trouble for you to take my money? Target practice is a lot more important than profits, Ollie. I?ll put the guns back. It's 93 cents. By golly, a $1 bill don't go nowhere these days. - There you are. - Thank you. - Hi, Ollie. - Hello. - Thanks a lot, Ollie. - So long, Dutch. Hi, Clem. - Railroad get along without you? - It's been a coon's age, Dutch. - I don't see you around. - Still hunt, still fish, store's still open. Uh-huh, but what I mean is, I don't see you riding out by the lake the way you used to. You do any riding at all now, Dutch? - Ted? - Yes, Dutch? New case of shells in the back. Do me a favour and bring them in. Sure. Now, what's in your craw, Clem? That lady you used to meet up with out riding. I seen her just now down at the depot. She's back. Just thought you'd like to know. I don't know what you're talking about, Clem. She still looks pretty speedy, Dutch. - Who's speedy, Dutch? You got a new girl? - No. Here, I?ll take the shells. - No, it's sort of an old girl. - Clem. You know Ted Murdoch, don't you? Father's the principal. - Hello. - Hello. Train's in, Ted. Run down to the post office and see if there's anything for me. Sure. See you. Say, er, what you gonna do, Dutch? What you gonna do? (DOG BARKING) Come on, Nellie. Come on. Excuse me for being late. Gotta go wash my hands. JOYCE: Lily will have to be there early. I have most of your things ready. LILY: The only thing I'm concerned about is that second act change. LILY: I?ll get Nancy to help me. JOYCE: I'm sure she will, dear. - Lily, you just picked at your food. - I'm not hungry. If you're nervous, honey, perhaps a glass of warm milk... Nervous about acting in a play? Oh, Daddy! You're just burned up because you can't do the main part - and play piano and pull up the curtain! - Daddy, make him shut up. Lena, Ted is here and you forgot to serve the beets. - Ted, that wasn't very polite, was it, sonny? - No, sir. Go have your dinner. Excuse me, but with the show and the party, I think my head is screwed on backwards. I was ready to pour the good soup right down the sink. - Hello, Lena. - Naomi. LILY: Mother! Mother, you came! You got the letter, Mother. You came. - I'm Lily, Mother. - Of course you're Lily, and so pretty. Am I what you expected? What a dramatic entrance you made. How stunning you look, doesn't she, Daddy? - Naomi. - Hello, Henry. This is quite a surprise. Do you think I could stay away after I got that wonderful letter? - What letter? - Daddy, I didn't want to bother you. I see. Well, at any rate, it was nice of you to come. - I hope you enjoy Lily's play. - Thank you, Henry. Ted, you were too young to remember your mother. - Naomi, this is Ted. - Hello, Ted, it's wonderful to see you. - How do you do? - And, Joyce. Oh, my goodness. What a difference, darling. I should think so. (NELLIE BARKING SOFTLY) - There's somebody I don't know at all. - That's Nellie. Dutch says she can be the best hunting dog in this neck of the woods. Dutch? Dutch Heinemann. He owns the hunting and fishing store. He's the greatest. It's so good to see you all. Lily, you're going to be a great actress. Wait till you see my gown. I practically designed it myself. Wait till you see the one I've got at the hotel for tonight. I've got to see it right away. Is it from New York? I can't wait till after. Ted, go get Mother's suitcase. You can change here. Could I, Henry? - If you two would like. - Wonderful. Lily, it's time you got ready. I have to do your collar and press your sash. There's plenty of time. Listen, the first thing an actress has to learn is that the show must go on. All right. I?ll be upstairs. I'm so glad that you're going to see me as Baroness Barclay tonight. It's a wonderful part and in the second act... - Lily! - Wait till you see the second act. Well, we don't have to stand here. Did you have your supper yet? Frankly, I'm starved. I was too excited to think about food. Then have something. You'll have to excuse me, I've got to get dressed. Come in the kitchen like the old days. Gosh. What do you know. Gosh. Oh, Lena! - I never thought, I never let myself hope... - I was really scared for a minute. - It will be all right. - Thank you for writing, for everything. - Somebody got to. - Lena, you've baked. Now I know I'm really home. Kitchen hasn't changed much, same old rocker. And the matchbox. - I used to be able to kick it, remember? - Could you now? - I'm not as young as I was. - Who is? But could you? Well, I... - One, two... - Three! - Joyce. - Did you press the petticoat, Lena? I have to get Lily ready. Joyce really takes care of the whole house. - Only since I've had to. - Well, you seem to be thriving on it. Why did you come back? Didn't you make us unhappy enough before? Joyce, please! Am I supposed to admire her for what she did? As far as I'm concerned, we aren't your family and you're not our mother. (TELEPHONE RINGING) HENRY: Hello? Of course, I don't see what else we can do. Do you, Sara? Yes, a lot has happened since this afternoon. Certainly. Goodbye. Honestly, Henry, I thought you knew all about the letter. - If I had dreamed how Joyce felt... - Only Joyce? Thank you for not making a scene. How could I in front of Lily? She idolises you, Naomi. Joyce is different, she's more like me. I don't think she'll forgive years of desertion for a few minutes of charm. I'm sorry. It's a good thing I'm leaving right after the play. Naomi, honestly, why did you come back? You hate this town. I told you. Lily. It was an impulse. I couldn't help it. Are you trying to tell me after all these years, you were suddenly seized with an irresistible impulse? Don't you think I wanted to see the children before? - You never tried! - Nobody asked me! - Would it have mattered if we had? - Naomi, your supper's ready. Don't let it get cold. I'm sorry, I don't think I've shouted since you left. - You could always do that to me. - Do you hate me this much, Henry? I'm thinking of the children. Our lives are settled now. We've lived down the talk, the scandal. If you've lived it down, fine, it won't start up again. - It won't. - I?ll go to the play alone. - You needn't see me again. - No, we'll go together. We'll make everything seem perfectly normal then you'll come back here to the party and you can catch the 12:15 for Chicago. That suits me. Er, one other thing. - That was Sara on the telephone. - Sara? Sara Harper. She's the drama teacher. They're putting additional chairs in the auditorium. - Seems there's a sudden demand for seats. - At least Lily will have a good house. And you'll be the centre of attention. I?ll make a good impression. That's all you care about, isn't it? What other people will think? I'm not the girl from across the tracks who used to embarrass you. Not anymore. I won't laugh too loud, make jokes or speak to the riffraff I knew before I married you. That's very good of you. Oh, Henry. I don't mean to quarrel. I hoped after all this time we could be friends. You did? Well, couldn't we, just for tonight, for Lily's sake? Couldn't we make it nice? Lt didn't used to be all fights. We did have fun at the start. We paid a pretty heavy price for that fun. Naomi. Good evening. Good evening, Miss Murdoch. Should be an interesting evening. - We're in time. She's not here yet. - That way, Mr Atkins. - Good evening, Mrs Phillips. - Good evening. - Have you seen her, Sara? - Your seat is over here. Look, Russ, the whole town seems to be here. Now, relax, will you? What difference does it make? - Sara, have you heard? - I think everybody has. I've never seen such a crowd. Dad didn't have anything to do with it. It was Lily. She wrote a letter... - Hello, Miss Harper. - Hello, Russ. Come on, honey. See, Dad. We made it. Good evening, Mrs Underwood, Colonel Underwood. - Is your father coming, Joyce? - Yes. Yes, of course. Here she comes. Is that her, Papa? She looks wonderful! Shh. - Good evening, Henry. - Hello, Sara. - Naomi, this is Miss Harper. - Hello, Sara. Henry has mentioned you. - How do you do, Mrs... - Call me Naomi. Naomi. - Erm, your seats are in the front row. - Thank you. - Where's Ted? - He's looking after the buggy. - Colonel Underwood. - Henry. - Mrs Underwood. - Good evening. - Important man? - Very. Sara's very nice. Very. Surprising she's never married. - I suppose she has her reasons. - Don't wait too long, Henry. She looks fabulous. Here, take a look. In your places, everyone, for the first act. Come on, hurry. Get ready for your entrance. Now, Lily, not any more of that. Now remember, in the third act, only a stage kiss. Good luck, everyone. Come clean now, John. What is on your mind? Exactly who is the Baroness Barclay? All evening I couldn't take my eyes off her. I would say the Baroness Barclay is the most fascinating woman I've ever met. Really? Why, here comes the Baroness now. Baroness, aren't you with the ladies? Why should I be when you're much more interesting? Besides, Mr Lexington, we haven't much time. Time? We? - Dick, would you think me rude if... - No, not rude. Just sensible. - And should I say rather fortunate. - No, wait. Please stay, Lord Bakersfield. - If you could enlighten me, Baroness... - Mr Lexington. NAOMI: It was just an amateurish high school play... until Lily came on stage. She looked beautiful. She had youth, charm and poise. Everything else seemed to melt away and for me, there was only Lily. It was almost magical. I couldn't take my eyes from her. She knew how to hold her head, use her hands. Oh, she was delightful. And with training, she could develop into an actress. When she said she knew what she was doing up there on the stage... she was right. Say, some crowd inside. You ought to get a cut, Clem. You should hear what the boys at the barbershop... Why, Dutch! What are you doing here? - Ticket's all right, isn't it? - Well, sure! Then tear it. (WHISPERING) First act's almost over. You leave me no alternative. I must go to the governor. Mr Lexington, you may do anything you wish. Threats will do you no good... because I shall never reveal what is locked in my heart. It is a sacred trust. (APPLAUSE) - Am I never to... - See you. ...see you again? Never again? Call me shameful for this if you want to, John... but the real shame would be in hiding what I feel. I love you, John. That's all there is to it. And if loving you is a crime, then I'm willing to pay the penalty. Haven't I told you, it was just a stage kiss? - Bravo! - Lily Murdoch! Lily Murdoch! Bravo! For all of us, thank you. For myself, if you think my performance was good, I want to tell you why. It was because my mother, the famous actress, Naomi Murdoch, is in the audience. Anything I've done tonight, I've done for her. - Well, it's quite a play. - Lily sure acted grown-up. I wouldn't have missed this for anything in the world. I'm going back and see her. Lily! You were perfect. It was absolutely marvellous. I love you. And Sara, it was wonderful, really wonderful. You were magnificent, each and every one of you. - I?ll see you all at the party later. - Mother, this is the best night of my life. Isn't she heavenly? (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, Russ. Thank you, Russ. Lily, the party's a darb, and you're sure a peacherino! - Tell it to the marines. - Put it where the flies won't get it. You wanna do the bunny hug with someone who can? Watch out for him. He's a lemon from Lemonville. 23 Skiddoo! I'm awfully glad you rescued me. His dancing is as bad as his acting. - Chuck, put this one on next, will you? - Two-step slide? Sure, that's the hottest thing from New York. But an apple-knocker like you wouldn't know that. We don't have to be left out, do we, Mrs Murdoch? Joyce didn't tell me she had such an attractive mother. May I borrow your fellow for a while, Joyce? I certainly approve of him. That's very good of you. Philip, what's the matter, don't you bunny hug? I've given that up, sir. After all, I'm going to be a freshman at Yale. Put a wreath on your nose, boy. You're dead from the neck up. - What a cake! - Please ask Lily to come and see. Lily! Come take a look. (LILY EXCLAIMS GLEEFULLY) - Chocolate buttercream? - Lily. But it's heavenly. Lena, you didn't tell me. You don't know everything that goes on in my kitchen. The best party we ever had! That Naomi! You know what, Peterson? You know what I thought when she walked in today? - No. - About you and me. Maybe if she, maybe if the children don't need me around anymore, finally you and me, you know, Peterson, what I mean? No. - JOYCE: Lena. - Yes. What about coffee for the grown-ups? We'll need some more sandwich plates. - I'm gonna take some cake up to Ted. - Joyce, don't fret about anything tonight. Peterson and me can take care of everything. Go out there. Enjoy the party. Dance with your fianc?. - She's dancing with him at the moment. - Go have fun with somebody else, then. What should I do? Dance gaily with some 16-year-old while she's taking over Russ? I'm not that good at pretending. Peterson, would you mind chopping me a chunk of ice out on the porch? No. Oh, Joyce, do you suppose that everything for her tonight is laughing and having fun? - Well, I'm not like her. - What's wrong with being like her? She has sense enough to enjoy a party when there is a party. She doesn't let some tiny little incey-bincey whatever spoil her evening, like some people I could mention. Spoil my evening? Good heavens. - You take Ted's cake. - That's my girl. Peterson, put that back in the tub. We don't need any ice. No? Joyce, I know you're only trying to make him jealous but Russ has been asking for you and I'm all worn out. Thank you, Mrs Murdoch. Come on, honey. Well, the feeling is very familiar. Do you know, when you smile, Joyce, you're pretty as a... Oh, Russ! Honestly. - Sara. - Henry. - I'm glad you've come. - I had a great deal to do at the auditorium. This sounds like quite a party, even halfway down the block. - Sara, it's so good of you to come. - Thank you. I want to tell you once again what a really fine job you did on the play tonight. Thank you very much. - We owe a great deal to our leading lady. - No, she owes a great deal to you. - That's very nice of you. - I'm sure that Sara would like some punch. Excuse us. Mrs Murdoch, what's the chances... I mean, it would be a pleasure if... - May I dance with you? - I'd love to. - There you are. - Thank you. - She's very charming, Henry. - Yes, she can even charm a Yale man. NAOMI: Oh, no. After our London success, we toured the provinces and then went to France. Paris, London. Must be exciting. - When were you in Europe? - Over three years ago. We were so popular I didn't think we'd ever get home. Where'd Lily go? Did you ever have a yen to go horseback riding? - HENRY: Sara. - I used to, if the horse was good. Well, I've got a lulu. I?ll tell you what, I?ll take you and Joyce horseback riding tomorrow, how about it? - I'd love to, but I'm leaving tonight. - You're hard to keep track of. Am I? Then, I'm willing to pay the penalty. - All right. - But not now. Mrs Murdoch, were you ever in the senior play? - I was never in the senior class. - Mother, do a scene for us. Please! That's very flattering, but there's nothing I can do. - Besides, it's late. I have to catch... - Just one scene. Anything. There is time, please. - I don't know what I could do. - I've got an idea! Now, Lily. Do something from this, Mother. I've always loved it and it's Daddy's favourite, too. Browning. I, erm... I better turn down the lights. "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. "I love thee to the depth and breadth and height "My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight "For the ends of Being and ideal Grace. "I love thee to the level of every day's most quiet need "By sun and candlelight. "I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; "I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise. "I love thee with a passion put to use "In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith. "I love thee with a love I seemed to lose With my lost saints, "I love thee with the breath, smiles, tears, of all my life! "And, if God chooses "I shall but love thee better after death." (ALL APPLAUDING) Mother, how heavenly, you were wonderful. Thank you, darling, that's music to my ears. Peterson, everything is in the bag. The mister is going, too. You and me can get married. - No. - Don't you like it? Well, then move! Say more, say like she does. "I love thee. Lena, I love thee." Now, put your arms around my neck and say it. Say it! I love... No! - Won't you please do something else? - Please. You don't know what this means to an actress. I'd love to. But I'm a believer in "always leave them asking for something more". Thanks again. I have to change. I have to catch the train. You're not catching any train tonight. Not even if Mr Murdoch rushed you down in his Stanley steamer. - But it's only... - You can't go by that old clock. It's slow. Is it? Lt's never been slow before... Henry, I'm sorry. I just got carried away. - Guess we both did. - What time is the train tomorrow? You can stay over for graduation. It will be wonderful to have you with us, won't it, Daddy? Of course. We'll be glad to have you here. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Good night. Good night, John. It was a wonderful party. As usual, I'm the last to leave. - Good night, Sara. - Good night. - I'm glad you were here, Sara. - Good night, Henry. - Good night. - Good night. - Naomi, you don't have to do that. - I'm just touching up a little. Let Lena do it in the morning. After all, this isn't your... No, I shouldn't be taking over, should I? I'm sorry, Henry. It just seemed the natural thing to do. This house, late at night, after all the guests have gone. Does this still go over there? Didn't the Tomlins give this to us for our anniversary? How can everything seem the same to you? I'm sorry about missing the train. Good night, Henry. Naomi, why did you leave me? All these years, I've wanted to know. I promised myself I'd never ask you, but... Why ask, then? I didn't know we'd find ourselves in the same house together. I thought you were coming up. - I've taken my things to Lily's room. - Thank you, Joyce. - Good night, Henry. - Good night. Good night, Dad. Will you turn off the lights? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - LILY: Mother? - Come in, angel. - I thought maybe I'd be too early. - No. I can sleep through anything but not a nest full of birds. Why all this fancy service? I brought everything Lena said you used to like. Fried ham and four-minute eggs. I have to watch my figure! I never take anything but black coffee. This morning I'm going to sin. And flowers. You're giving me the real star treatment. Wait until I've been with you and know all the other little things. Been with me... What are you talking about? Why, don't you know? I'm going with you. I want to get out of here just as much as you did. With the great Naomi Murdoch introducing me, my career is set. Lily, you just can't plan this fast. - Let me give it to you straight... - I wasn't any good in the play. Be frank with me, be cruel. You don't think I can act. Baby, you were fine. You can act, probably better than I ever could. - Mother, then we can do it, can't we? - Lily. When you wrote that letter, did you count on me taking you with me? I always wanted to be with you, darling, always. - LENA: Lily? - Yes? You have to go to Miss McIntyre. For Caesar's sake! My graduation dress, I forgot. - Hi, Ted. - Hi. Grab these, will you? - Is Joyce up? - Sure. - Hey, Joyce! - Russ! I'm gonna be an actress in New York. Mother's taking me with her. Well, I sure feel sorry for Sarah Bernhardt. Joyce! Hello, handsome! What are you doing here? Aren't you ready? I came to take the Murdoch girls riding. You really meant it. Which one is mine? She's a beauty. I wish I could go. - You're not gonna back out? - I didn't pack any riding clothes. How did I know I was going to meet a dashing young horseman? Some clothes of yours are in the attic. I think there's a riding habit. No, it can't be true! We're saved, handsome. Ask Lena for a cup of coffee. We'll be down in a couple of shakes. I hope it doesn't smell too much of mothballs. - If it does, you can wear mine. - But you're going with us. No. It's no fun for Russ to ride with me. I'm a dub on a horse. Well, he asked you, didn't he? Maybe he wanted a chaperone while he rode with my glamorous mother. - Wait a minute, Joyce. - I know it's not serious. But you just can't help amusing yourself with every attractive man in sight, can you? Suppose that were true, what are you going to do about it? - Nothing. What can I do? - I thought you liked Russ. - I love him, I guess. - But you wouldn't put up a fight for him? - Afraid of my competition? - Afraid? We're a big disappointment to each other, aren't we? You've got a mother with no principles. I've got a daughter with no guts. Don't be a fool, Joyce. Put on your riding habit. Mum? I was just wondering. If you're gonna be here for a little while, - maybe I could show you where I go fishing. - That would be fun! There's a wonderful spot down by the falls. Look at the bass I caught last year. Dutch Heinemann, that's him there. He helped me a little. We'll go when we can find the time. - If you really like fishing... - I love it. I knew you would. I?ll get everything ready! Try and make it tomorrow. Come on, Joyce, swat her a couple of times. You can't fall off old Polly. She's the safest plug in the stable. You'd be a good rider if you'd learn to relax. It's beautiful here, isn't it? I've never seen this spot. - You ever been here before, Mrs Murdoch? - Yes. I used to come here once in a while. It would be a wonderful spot for canoeing, wouldn't it, Russ? - It's so lovely. - Run along, you two. I?ll sit this one out. - No, Mrs Murdoch... - All right, let's go, Russ. Mind if I try your horse? I'm getting a little tired of safe old Polly. Well, I don't know, Joyce. He's pretty frisky. You mean it takes guts to ride him? - No, I... - Help me up, Russ. All right. Come on, Russ. I was beginning to think you'd never show up. I was riding with Joyce and her beau. You must have seen them. You knew I'd be here. Still as conceited as ever, aren't you, Dutch? Still as crazy about you. You know how I wanted to see you ever since I heard you were back? Last night, I even waited outside the house. Figured you'd go back to the hotel. No fooling. Old friends like us have a lot to remember together. Old friends? I was back at the house this morning. Up on the hill. Almost gave the old signal. Remember? - Two shots, and then one. - Two shots, and then one. - I used to hear them in my sleep. - You've never forgotten it, not for a minute. Honey, where have you been? Don't you know what you did to me? Why did you leave me? If I had stayed, the way it was going, how much longer could we just have moments, just see each other out here? I was afraid I'd want more. And in this town, I wasn't gonna do that to my family. Who's more important, them or me? - I should've figured that out. - Who cares? You're back and we're together, the two of us. - I'm leaving tomorrow night. - I?ll be here tomorrow afternoon, then. We can't go... We can't go back. Who says we can't? You wanna go right back to the old days and so do I, Naomi. - So do I. - Goodbye, Dutch. I?ll be here. Two shots and then one. And I?ll be here. Erm... - Sara. - Hello, Mrs Murdoch. Naomi. - How nice of you to come and see me. - Well, I'm afraid, I came to ask a favour. - Oh? - About the graduation tomorrow night. We always have a little entertainment and I thought that perhaps you might... That I might appear. It would be such a favour to me and you do recite so beautifully. That's very flattering, but why do you need me? You must have plenty of corn-fed talent to fill the bill, someone the good people of this town wouldn't mind applauding. But that's just why, I mean... - It would be such a good opportunity. - Opportunity? If the nicer people of this town could see you as the children did last night. I know they'd be impressed. They couldn't help but be, and... - And maybe they might accept me. - I didn't mean... Why should you want me to endear myself to the citizens of this town? You of all people? - I'm very fond of your husband. - That's what I meant. - And I want him to be happy. - Isn't he going to be? - You're the woman he needs. - But you're the woman he wants. I'm a realist, Naomi. Henry and I, it wasn't love. Not on his part, anyway. We had things in common and we drifted together. Perhaps if you hadn't come back. - I'm leaving, remember? - That wouldn't make any difference now. I lost him the minute he saw you again. And then there are the children. Ted's taken to you without question. He's such a fine, open-hearted boy. - And Lily loves you. - And Joyce doesn't and... There are lots of things you don't know about. - You mean well, but forget it. - Are you afraid, Naomi? - Oh, Sara! - Hello, Joyce. Your mother and I have been having the nicest talk. You look like you've been having a good time. I have! I took the liberty of glancing through your Shakespeare. I marked some of the passages that I thought might do. - If you change your mind... - I?ll let you know. - Goodbye, Naomi. Bye, Joyce. - Goodbye. You were gone for such a long time, I was afraid something might have happened. No, we were having a wonderful time. - Your hair looks nice that way, Joyce. - Thank you. Russ thinks so, too. But I?ll have to fix it before he picks me up... - Could I help? I'm good at that sort of thing. - I can manage. I thought perhaps we might have a little talk. I frankly don't want to have a sweet mother-daughter chat with you while you comb me out. I guess that's telling me. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be harsh, but... - Look, I'm not thinking of myself. - I'm not even thinking of Lily when she tells me a lot of silly plans about going on the stage with you. But I am thinking of Daddy. He's unhappy. I know he is, ever since you came back. He spent nearly the whole night pacing the floor. Are you trying to tell me it would be better if I left here right away? Yes, I really think it would. Naomi, about the menu for tonight, I think you would like my wiener schnitzel with fresh carrots... NAOMI: Lt was perfectly delicious. LENA: Lt's much better if you soak it in vinegar overnight. HENRY: All right, Lena, you can clear. - Hi, Russ. - Hi, Ted. - Good evening, Russ. - Good evening, Mrs Murdoch. - Like a cup of coffee? - No thanks. Joyce will be... Say! - Well, you're looking very lovely tonight. - Thank you. - Don't keep her out too late. - I wouldn't put that in writing, sir. - Have a good time. - Good night. - Don't be too late, Ted. - I won't. Tonight, Naomi, I'm afraid I've got to finish that annual chore, signing diplomas. Henry, I've thought it over and I think it would be best if I left on the train tonight. But you can't do that, Naomi. Sara tells me you're set for the graduation ceremonies tomorrow. That doesn't make any difference. - Joyce said something this afternoon... - Joyce. Look... Joyce hasn't planned on having you here so she's finding it difficult to adjust to something new. - Like her father, I guess. - No, Henry, this is best. It's only one more day, Naomi. Frankly, I'd be disappointed if you weren't there tomorrow. - You would? - Mother, shall we tell him now? Tell me what? Daddy, I want you to be calm and reasonable about this. I?ll try not to be impetuous. - Mother and I have a wonderful plan. - Lily, I never... She's taking me to New York, introduce me to all the important people in the theatre and get me started. - I never promised... - She's only saying that as you'll get mad. It's a terrible life for a girl. Believe me, I know! Naomi, maybe it's better if Lily does go now, before she has any bridges to burn. I learned a long time ago you can't keep people from doing what they have to do. - It's up to your mother. If she's willing... - Daddy, thank you! Mother, did you hear that? I knew he would. - Lena! - Lily. Lily! Lena. Lena! I'm going to New York. I'm gonna be an actress on the stage. Mr Peterson, my mother's taking me to New York. - When did all this happen? - Just now, can you believe it? Peterson! You know what? If she goes and leaves the mister... maybe we have still to wait a little longer. - No. - Yes. JOYCE: I hate to go in. RUSS: Why should you go in on a night like this? - Oh, because it's so late. - It can't be. - I've hardly talked to you. - Whose fault is that? Yours. - There's a time and a place for everything. - You're so right. - You know, I loved that lake. - Yes. - And I loved canoeing with you. - Yes. - And I love... - Yes? And that's the way I always want to think of you. Don't get up for me. That you, Ted? A little late, isn't it? Lily's already in bed. I guess so. But it's not a school night. Good night. Ted. Would you like me to come up and tuck you into bed? Gosh, I don't get tucked in bed anymore. - No, of course you don't. Good night. - Good night. - Night, Dad. - Good night, son. You forget what you've missed. You're lucky. I remember. Now, that I'm here, I remember, too. But you've had both, Naomi. Career, success in the great big outside world, and marriage, to a little man like me. I don't know, Henry. Maybe I never had a career. Maybe I never knew the man. It makes you wonder. Wonder? We all want things we don't have. It must've been difficult for you being married to me. You were so young, the things you wanted. I was crazy ever to think a girl like you could settle into my dull routine. I know I wasn't patient. I worried too much about what people would say. And I worried too little. - You've had your compensations. - Compensations? No, I don't think so, Henry. You don't know how unimportant success is until you've had it... or what a home means until you've lost it. I have missed you, Henry. You and the children. I've missed you too, Naomi, when I wasn't hating you. I didn't think you'd miss me at all. For a long time I hoped you'd come back. - Is it too late? - I don't know. I don't know. Where is everybody? - Big day like today and everybody's lazy. - Good morning, Lena. - Good morning. - Isn't it a wonderful morning? - It's a wonderful world. - It's about time. - Good morning, Theodore. - Well, hi, Baroness. I would say the Baroness Barclay was the most fascinating... Where are you going? I've got sense enough not to waste the day around here. - It's way past noon now. - Hi, Ted. - Good morning, Lena. - Good morning, Joyce. Lily. Oh, it's a beautiful day isn't it? Well, you must have had a good time last night. I did. I plead guilty, your honour. A grand time. You should spend more time in canoes. - Good morning, Lena, Lily, Joyce. - Good morning. - Smells wonderful. I swear I?ll stuff myself. - I'd have brought you a tray. Never slept better in my life. Even those birds couldn't wake me. - Good morning, Lena. - Good morning, sir. Children. Good morning, Naomi. Good morning, Henry. I hope you slept well. I believe the expression is "like a top", or is it "like a log"? - Like a log. - Uh-huh. Ted finished already? We've got a lot to do uptown today and there isn't much time. I think maybe we'll find there's plenty of time. - Your mother may stay on for a while. - Wonderful! For how long? We can have some clothes made. I've been wondering what I could wear in New York. Lily, I may not be going to New York. - Not going? - We may be able to persuade your mother to stay on for quite a long time. - Even... - But your promise! I never promised. I told you that I would try. What did you say to her? Lt was you, wasn't it? And after you gave me permission. - At least I thought you were honest. - Lily! How could you give up everything that matters? You let him keep us both in this stuffy town just because he's stuffy and old-fashioned himself. Lily! I?ll talk to her. - Not now, Joyce. - I won't have her speak to you like that. - She never did... - Joyce! Just sit down and have your breakfast. I'm sorry, I don't think I'm hungry. Some mornings it just doesn't pay to start anything. Well, at least breakfast started out to be happy. Don't worry about the girls. Something new for them. They'll get over it. Lily, yes. But Joyce... Joyce will be happy if I am. And I am. (TWO GUNSHOTS) Stop worrying about the girls. (SINGLE GUNSHOT) Naomi, don't go! You can't, not now. I'm going to stop it once and for all. Hey, Mum! Mum, up here. Come on, Nellie. She's probably looking for us. - Yes, you're here now, aren't you? - I'm here for the last time. - We're through. - Through? Henry's letting me stay. It's over between us. - You're gonna stay and not see me? - I never want to see you. Don't ever bother me again. The only reason you'd stay is for me and you know it. I know you inside and out. You couldn't stand it without me. - You came back for me. - I love Henry and the children, I'm not gonna throw it away again. You think I'd let you stay here without me? Know you're in that house? - Watch those lights go out at night? - Let me alone, Dutch. Don't ruin everything again. I'd have been all right before if it hadn't been for you. Now, I'd have my home and my kids. I don't care about your home. I care about you and me! I treated you special, honey, but I've been too genteel with you. Don't touch me! (GUNSHOT) Mum. No. - Dutch. - Ted, hurry and get some help. No, wait. See if we can get him in the buggy. Dutch, can you... Get his other arm. Careful, now. So the cards would read like this. "Hans Peterson is proud to announce his marriage to Lena Svenson." - Lena Maria Svenson. - "Lena Maria Svenson." Lt's Dutch Heinemann. Cancel my order. Be right back, Philip. I'm just stepping over to the pharmacy. Mrs Tomlin, how is... Ted. We've never had a real talk, but you've got to let me tell you what happened. It was an accident, a horrible accident. - I tripped... - Why did you go see him? - Mrs Murdoch. - Doctor, how is he? He's unconscious, but I think we can pull him through. We've taken the slug out. - Look, sonny, why don't you go home? - Come on, Nellie. I'm an old man and I say what I think. I'm the doctor and I know Riverdale. As soon as I make my report to the police, - Dutch Heinemann shot by a woman. - But I told you, it was an accident. It makes no difference what you tell me. Maybe it was an accident. Do you think that'll make any difference? Already out there, those maggots have got it all over town. The whole story, in the worst way. The oldest and the nastiest story in the world. - What can I do? - You can go back to Chicago. For Henry's sake, and the children's. Funny, isn't it? How things work out. Mum, she's coming out now. - What happened? - She shot Dutch Heinemann. Come in. Hello, Russ. And then, after the graduation march, maybe you ought to give your speech to the graduating class? Pardon me, Miss Harper. Mr Murdoch, could I see you alone? Well... - Sure, Russ. - I have things to do in the auditorium. I?ll be back. Well, what is it, Russ? Naomi shot Dutch Heinemann. She took him to Doc Tomlin's. I just heard about it. I don't know how badly he's hurt, but... Listen to me, Henry. Everything's at stake. Your whole career. You've got to act right away, and I hope you know what to do. This time it's pretty evident what kind of a woman she is. Colonel Underwood, please leave me alone. All right, Henry. Dad, I've got to go over to Joyce. - I've got to stay with her. - You're coming with me. - Sara? - Yes, Colonel Underwood? What's the matter, Russ? You look so... Sara. - Mrs Murdoch shot Dutch Heinemann. - No. - No, you can't go. What will we all do? - You'll all do a lot better. - You are not quitting? - When you're licked, you've got to quit. Oh, Lena. I will fix you something to take on the train. Is Mother upstairs? Lena, isn't it terrible? Mother, I just heard. I don't care what you did. You can count on me. - You're leaving? - It's the least I can do. I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to everybody. Now we can leave together, the two of us, the way we planned. For heaven's sake! How can you be so selfish when there's Dad to think about? - Don't you know what this will mean to him? - Of course I'm thinking about Dad. But I've always wanted to go. After all, Mother will be even more famous. Famous? So you want to be famous like Naomi Murdoch? Of course I do. Well, honey, let me tell you just how famous that really is. I didn't think you fell for that line I was handing out for the yokels, but if you did... - Line? - After all, a girl has her pride. There doesn't seem to be much demand for the classics now - and practically none at all for me. - Mother. I'd like to leave you thinking I was up there in lights, but... I've got enough on my conscience without... You think all you have to do is get on that train and when you get off, you'll be in the star's dressing room. Oh, no. The theatre's a tough jungle, kids. I've got no glory, no glamour and bruises on my illusions. And I can't complain, I never starved. I've been a stooge for a trained seal. I sold corsets when times were bad. I live in cheap hotels and con the bookers so they won't know how bad I need money. And I can name a pawnshop in every town on the circuit. Next season, if I'm lucky, I?ll do a rather tired single. It's not very dignified. Matter of fact, it's rather vulgar. And I?ll be billed below the dog acts. - But if you want to come and join me... - Lily. I'd love to have you with me. - Some sandwiches and fruit. - Thank you. Would you please put these cases on the front porch? Of course I will. Ted, can I talk to you for a while? Ted, today you found out that people who you want to be perfect aren't perfect. Sometimes people do bad things, or what seem like bad things. That doesn't always mean that they are bad or that they want to be. They can hurt other people awfully, people they wouldn't hurt for anything in the world. The way you were hurt today. Try not to hate me too much. Forget me if you want to, but... If you go on hating me, you'll be hurt for always. Oh, Ted, I couldn't bear that. From here on, when you'll be hurt more and more... when everything in life seems wrong and you think that nobody understands you or loves you... just remember, your mother loves you with all her heart... even if she hasn't been very good at proving it to you. Please stay. I wish I could... but I can't. - I'm not crying. - No, of course you're not. Of course you're not. Doc. - What's gonna happen? - Everything's gonna be all right now. Just one moment. - Mr Murdoch. - Henry. - Henry, now listen to me. He's a sick man... - Leave us alone. I ought to kill you, Dutch. You must feel just great, lying there laughing your head off at me. Yeah, sure. It was easy to take her away from me, wasn't it? Anytime you wanted to. All you had to do was give the signal. First two shots and then one. Oh, yes, I finally figured it out. Now, you've picked up right where you left off in the good old days. I congratulate you both on getting what you wanted. What I wanted? That looks like it, don't it? I guess that's from a real hot kiss instead of a whip. - A whip? - All in remembrance of the good old days. Why'd you let us go ahead in the good old days if you knew? You lost her then and you should've lost her this time. - I still don't know what she sees in you. - Naomi? What's the matter? Don't you believe me, school teacher? I'm on the level with you. She wants you, all right. You two can have each other. A great pair. You and Naomi Murdoch are my idea of... just nothing. Now, I suppose she's spreading around town she had to plug me to stop me from going after her. Dad, I was so worried. I came after you to find out if you were all right. The doctor will be right in. First time he's ever let a patient get excited. What's there to get excited about? We can get through everything at the school, all right, Dad. I even got Lily to put on a new dress, and she went out with her head up. She really broke Lily's heart. Don't worry about Lily. She'll be all right. She's still a child. It's awful for us, I know, but we're still together. - We can live it down. - Be quiet. Excuse me. If I've been stupid, I guess it's not surprising that you have, too. If she made Lily hate her, it's because she wants to keep Lily from making the same mistakes she made. If she wants to leave us, it's because she loves us so much. She thinks we'll be happier without her. She loves us? Yes, she loves me. And she loves Lily, she loves Ted. She loves you. Joyce, you're so much like me. Don't be. You'll lose what you want most of all in the world. You go ahead, honey. Tell Sara she'll have to get someone else to deliver my address. I've got something more important to do. Naomi. You shouldn't be here. They expect you at the auditorium. - You think I'd be anywhere else? - I've gotta catch the train. - I'm asking you to stay. - No, I can't, not now. - This is best for everybody. - No, it's not. - If you'd only forgive me. - Forgive you? Years ago I was a coward. I lost you for it. That was one mistake. Maybe I was entitled to it. But if you make the same mistake twice, you're really a fool. No, Henry, believe me, this is the only way. You couldn't stay in this town. These people... They'll have us to face. The two of us together. Naomi, some people just grow old. Others grow up. It's time you and I decided what kind of a husband and wife we're going to be. I think you know the kind of husband I mean. One who has faith in his wife, believes her, loves her. Oh, Henry. The girls will be home soon. We can wait for them.
