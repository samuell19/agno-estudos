Young man seated here by the defendant's table, is accused of somethin' he didn't do. Somethin' he couldn't do. He is accused of murderin' the friend that he loved most in the whole world. Cliff Petrie is a good boy, with a good mama, who works hard to give him a decent and honorable life, and Cliff was doin' fine, just fine, until he took up with a jezebel named Lily Becker. - I have to caution you, Mr. Cameron. - Your Honor. Now I know there's no one in the court room today who doesn't know what it's like in the spring time of their life when the juices are runnin'. Nature made it happen that way. So when nature got hold of Cliff Petrie, it was only natural for a manly Southern boy. If there was anything not natural, it was Lily Becker's back we'd assume. (people cheering) Maybe she wasn't raised right. Maybe it was somethin' in her blood.

He'll probably come and get me at the mill, it was our place. I should go there and wait. Say something. - [Radio Announcer] And that was the most requested song of the week. We'll be back to music after the news. On the local front, a county-wide manhunt has been launched for 17-year-old Alex Cutler, now officially missing for more than two weeks.

(owl hooting) - Do you think he's watching us? - No. - Where do you think you go when you die? - I don't believe in angels and all that. - You think you just die and the worms eat you? - No. - It's cold. (Lily sighs) - What will we do? - Get jobs. Find a place to live. - Get married. (dramatic instrumental music) - You did it, didn't you? You did it for me? - No. - How do I know? You'd do anything for me then. - I would, I swear. - Anything? - Anything. - Maybe you should be like Alex. Want me until you get me and when you get me, throw me away. - Oh, I'd never do that to you. - You can tell me anything. If you won't tell me anything, how do I know you'd do anything? - I would. - You did it, didn't you? Hm? Did it for a four letter word, L-O-V-E. Hm? Say yes. Say it. (dramatic instrumental music) - Darry! Come quick! - Did you hear from Alex? If he ran away, why didn't he take his wallet? (puppy whelps softly) - This here is Alex's pup. - You telling me Alex is coming back? Are ya? - I don't know. (engine humming) (radio chatter) - Darryl and Randy found him. - They found him. - Where? - In the woods. Looks like the body had been there quite a while. (sighs) - Oh my God. (rock music) - A loss that we lost a musician that could play and sing. But he's in a new choir now, he sings a new song. Many wonder why in this time a life would be shortened so soon. But let us turn to God to his holy spirit that was sent for a comforter and a guide. And through these words may we find comfort. God has not promised skies always blue, flowers bloom halfways all our lives though. God has not promised sunshine without rain, joy without sorrow, peace without pain. But god has promised strength for the day, rest for the labor, light for the day. Grace for the trials, help from above, undying sympathy, undying love. - Hear, hear. - Amen. (people chattering) - Let's get in the cruiser, Cliff. - What'd you tell him all that stuff for? Crazy. He was my best friend. - [Attorney] Now, Mrs. Johnson, you reside in Elton, Georgia? - [Lily] Yes, sir. - [Attorney] But you and Mr. Johnson are no longer living together. - No, sir. - How long have you know the defendant, Cliff Petrie? - [Lily] All through school, same as Alex. - [Attorney] And what was your relationship with Cliff Petrie? - We were friends. - [Attorney] Good friends? (pencil scratching) - He loved me. - [Defending Attorney] Objection. - [Judge] Sustained. - Mrs. Johnson, the day that you and Alex planned to run away, when Alex didn't show up, what did you do? - I went home. I cried. I cried. Then I heard Alex disappeared and everybody's looking for him. I thought, that's why he didn't come to get me. He didn't come to get me because somethin' terrible happened to him. Have to be somethin' terrible for him not to come get me. - Did you know what it was? - When... Cliff told me. - [Attorney] What did Cliff tell you? - Alex was dead. - [Attorney] Cliff told you this before Alex's body was found? - [Lily] He did. - Mrs. Johnson, can you tell the jury exactly what Cliff told you? - It was a long time ago. - [Attorney] That's alright, you take a minute. Recall your previous testimony. Now you and Cliff were alone in the mill, is that correct? - Yes. - [Attorney] And what did Cliff tell you? (dramatic music) - He'd do anything for me. - [Attorney] Did he tell you what he meant by that? - He did it for me. Did it for a four letter word. L-O-V-E. - [Attorney] Did what? - What he did. - [Attorney] Mrs. Johnson, did Clifford Petrie tell you that he killed Alex Cutler? - I asked him, he said, yes. (crowd mutters) - You're still hooked on her. It's written all over your face for the jury to read. - So? - So it's not in your favor. You know the words to God Bless America? - Sure, why? - This afternoon when Lily Becker takes the stand, I want you to look the other way and keep singing God Bless America to yourself. (phone ringing) Now, Ms. Johnson, I understand you and your husband, Billy, are no longer living together, is that correct? - Yes. - [Attorney] You live at home again with your daddy. - And my mama. - When you married Billy Johnson, where you and Billy in love? - Yes. - And when you made plans to run away with Alex Cutler, where you and Alex in love? - [Lily] Yes. - And were you and Cliff Petrie also in love? - No. - [Attorney] But you agreed to marry Cliff also. - He wanted to. - So in the space of a few months you agreed to marry three different young men. Is that correct? Didn't you testify, and I quote, Cliff did it for a four letter word, L-O-V-E? Aren't we really talking about a three-letter word? S-E-X! - [Plaintiff's Attorney] Objection, counsel is assaulting the witness. - [Judge] Sustained. - Your honor, why would anyone do anything for L-O-V-E, if there was no L-O-V-E? Are we to let the jury assume that we're talking about chaste love? This is a murder trial not Valentine's day! - Your honor, counsel is attempting to defame the private and personal life of a fine Southern woman. His questioning is an attack and an assassination of character. (gavel banging) - Order in the court. The jury will ignore remarks of counsel. (attorney clears throat) - Now, Ms. Johnson, we're gonna start all over again. Let's start with your last year in high school, with being young. Sometimes that's the crime, isn't it? Having hopes, wanting to see what's out there in the world. When you're young, you have dreams that the old have already forgotten. - Objection, counsel is addressing the jury not the witness. - [Judge] Counsel will limit his remarks to pertinent questions. - When Alex Cutler told you that his parents wouldn't let him see you anymore, that hurt you, didn't it? - He didn't mean to. - [Attorney] You remember what he said, how that made you feel? (sighs) - He said, he said his daddy said I had something he wanted, but it wasn't gonna last long. So he should just forget about marrying me. - [Attorney] What else did he say? - I don't. He said his mommy said I was trash. I said, when you throw me away then I'd be trash. That's how you make something trash, by throwing it away. What are you gonna do with me? You need somebody to love you so you're not nothing. So you're not trash. Cliff treated me special. - Would you mind... Looking directly at the defendant please. Now I know you don't wanna hurt any more, do you? - No. - [Attorney] And you don't wanna hurt anyone else, do you? - You're Honor, I object to these theatrics. - I'll reserve judgment until I see where counsel is headin'. - Is there something that you would like to say directly to the defendant? - [Judge] Witness will respond. (dramatic music) - You don't understand. When boys love you, they'll do anything. I mean, they lose their mind. They do things that are wrong and bad because they don't know what they're doing. That's how much they want you. It's what my daddy said. He's right. My daddy said... No one would ever love me as much as him. But he was wrong. Only one person ever loved me as much as my Daddy. Not Alex, not Billy. Just Cliff. Only Cliff. - I'm not goin' back in that courtroom. - What are you talking about? - What if it was you sitting where I'm sitting and my daddy was in the witness box? I can't stand to have her be put through this. And I can't stand what I'm feeling. - You're talking about that tramp. - Don't call her that! It's worth it to me to not have her be put through this! - Look, she has already ruined your life. - I'm not goin' back in there. - She's crazy, she's lying. - I'm not gonna go back. - Your Honor, I know this is highly irregular, but I ask the court's indulgence. During the last recess, my client, Cliff Petrie, asked to confer with me privately. It seems that in direct opposition to my advice, he has elected not to continue with the due process of this trial. Your Honor, with all deference to yourself and to my honorably colleague, Mr. Lambert, my client has decided to plead guilty to the manslaughter of Alex Cutler.
