THE SECRET OF THE TELEGIAN (DENSO NINGEN) Come one, come all! The Cave of Horror will fill you full of terror! Once you enter, you'll see ghosts, goblins and creatures... ... you've never dreamed of, chill and thrill you! Alright! See it for yourself today! Men, pick up your courage and step forward! Bring in your girlfriend for the thrill of a lifetime! Well? Come in! Come in! Come in! It's here! It's all here! Enter the Cave of Horror and let it grip you in it's thrills and chills! Well? Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in! How about it? Well, come one, come all everyone and be terrorized by the Cave of Horror! Come in, come in! There's no waiting! No waiting! Well, come in men and test your own mettle! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Enter! Enter if you dare! Who's there? It's me, Tsukamoto. Hey! Hey! A murder! A murder! Hey! Call the police! - I assure you, all of the monsters are fake. It's terrible! - What are you talking about? Kirioka... Where is Kirioka? He was here a moment ago. What's the matter with him? If you see him, tell him I need the stereophonic work today. - Sure. Kirioka told me to give you this. - What is it? Where is he now? He went to an amusement park about a murder. He just left. Hey, wise guy! He works in science, not the City Desk! When will the police give a statement? - You'll have to wait a little longer. - Longer?! Anyway, can you get us a detective? - We need to get an interview! As far as I know, we had the police inspect the park a year ago... ...and never had a problem. - Is that so? - Yes. - We'll discuss that later. - Yes. - Hey, pops! - Yes? Is this the sort of thing you have in that cave? - Of course not. There's nothing dangerous at all in there. Has anyone disappeared since the murder? No, I'm sure that everyone's still here. No one has left. I suppose everyone here witnessed the murder. Does anyone remember what he looked like? We need your complete cooperation. Well, um... We couldn't recognize his face. Is this better? This is where the murder occurred. All of you were standing here. Are you saying you couldn't see this man? Yes, but all we could see was his back. - Yes, that's right. Then where did he run off to? That way. Hey, they're coming out of the cave! Hey, reporters! Reporters! Here! Huh? Is that you, Kirioka? Oh, Yoshi! You! Are you saying this guy's a reporter? - Yes, it's true. What did he do? I might have guessed he was a journalist. Captain. We found this on the victim's body. Those are identification tags. - As if a child couldn't figure that one out! "Tsukamoto, meet me at the Cave of Horror in the amusement park... ... if you wish to learn what happened fourteen years ago." Onishi... ...you don't think there's a possibility that Tsudo might have sent such a thing to us? Nonsense. - But Tsukamoto was murdered while wearing his tag! I know it's him! It's Lance Corporal Tsudo's work! Takashi, don't forget that we saw Tsudo die. After all this time, do you think a corpse will return to life? But, we never managed to find his body or remains! His remains simply decomposed. But! Listen... I think I know who's behind this. Who is it?! Taki... Taki? He's a contractor working for Kofu. That's right. - But why would he murder Tsukamoto unless he had a reason? I don't think there's a reason for it! I think he has one. Taki must suspect that we found gold fourteen years ago. He doesn't know we made our money through smuggling. He thinks that we found the box Professor... ... it's not an ordinary wire, is it? Kirioka... ...I believe that this is a Klyotron. A Klyotron? To put it simply, it's a substance that can take the place of a transistor. So, it's similar to a vacuum tube? Yes. It requires the use of a metal named Tantam. Thin wires are wound around a small metal bar in this manner. It has many possibilities. It is much smaller in size than any other transistor currently available. So it must be very practical, huh? However, there is a drawback. It needs to be kept at a low temperature consistently. It must be at 4.2 degrees Celsius at all times, or it simply will not function at all. Oh, it must be kept at four degrees? Akiko, you have a customer. Oh, really? I think he works for a housing corporation. - That's right. Do you know him? - I don't know him. He bought some refrigeration units from us recently. Really? That must be why he seems so cold and clammy. Sorry to keep you waiting. Um... have a seat. Are you in the sales department? Yes, my name is Akiko Chujo. The truth is, I'm here about those refrigeration units. You've delivered two of the four I ordered... ...but I need the other two completed and shipped to me quickly. Oh, them... We just shipped those units out yesterday. Then I must have just missed them. I'm sorry we couldn't get them to you sooner. - No, no... I'm sure it wasn't your fault. By the way, were they delivered to the Kurasawa station? Yes. Oh, really? Thank you for your help. Tsukamoto was a bachelor, as far as I know. He didn't mix much with the folk around here. Oh? Do you know where he worked? - I know that he was a broker. He always paid his bills on time, too. He seemed like he was doing just fine. Do you mind if I look around his apartment? - Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. It's room three on the second floor. - Thank you. I'm sorry. No, it was my fault. - How could you know where I was? I'll get them. Sorry. What? It's you?! You had me worried for a moment. Kobayashi! It's okay. It's just a reporter. What? Is that you, Kirioka? Kobayashi? Fancy meeting you here. Do you know him? - He and I went to school together. Hey, I never pegged you for a reporter. That's a joke! I started writing science articles as soon as I left college. So, a science reporter is investigating a murder? Well, what do you know about this murder case? There had to be a reason why someone would want to see Tsukamoto dead. It seems so... Smuggling? Narcotics? We're not sure. We kept our eyes on him, but he was murdered before we could discover anything. Attention! Loyal guests! At ease! Welcome to the Military-Land Cabaret! Hey, aren't you thirsty? I'm drinking. - Your friend seems the quiet type. He'd be a good soldier. Did you go to college with him? - Yes. He was one of the best students there. This is too strong. What kind of drink is this? - It's our 'Hand Grenade'. It's not for me. Can I have something lighter. - Sure. Two "Missiles", please! - Oh yes, sir! Roger! I'm getting kind of hungry too. Hey, how about some rations? - Yes, sir! I'll transport them right away! Transport? Hey, Kobayashi... Talk to me. What about? What would bring you to this place? I'm not blind, you know. Take a guess. The broker's murder? Hmm... that's good. We've been on to this place for a while. It's owned by a smuggler named Takashi. Our detective friend has come back again. We should thank him for the business. That other guy... He doesn't look like a policeman. - Right. They must not have found anything in Tsukamoto's room. He was a careful person... Much too careful to leave anything suspicious in his room. About the situation with Taki... I think we should get rid of him right away. In his current state, he may try to pull some kind of blackmail on us. Master! Master, there's a customer who wants to see you. Who is it? He said you would know him by this. Shall I send him in? Hello! Taki, when did you get here? Onishi, I want you to stop doing this to me. Stop doing? What are you talking about? Don't play with me! It's this! You guys have been sending these ID tags to me! Then you've been getting them too? You mean you guys aren't behind it? - It wasn't us. Taki, you heard the news that Tsukamoto was murdered? That ID tag... Takashi and I got one too. We actually thought... maybe you had sent them to us. - You must be joking! But then, who could be responsible for sending them to us? We don't know. If it's not either of us... No, could it be? - Who is it?! - Taki, it's Lance Corporal Tsudo. What? Lance Corporal Tsudo?! Idiot! Knock before you come in! Yes, sir. A man gave this to me and asked that I bring it to you. Hey, I should head home. So soon? Who's waiting for you to come home? It doesn't matter how long. They know you're here. I know, but it's still too early. Stick around. Hurry up. Come closer... Hey, guys, that's some attack! I'd like to have her for an enemy! Gentlemen, do you recognize the sound of this gun? Surely you haven't forgotten the sound of my voice. It's Tsudo! I've waited for fourteen years. There's no way I could forget you... Lieutenant Onishi... Intelligence Agent Takashi... Taki, of the Construction Corp. I am Tsudo. The man you bastards tried to kill, Lance Corporal Tsudo. I've never forgiven you bastards for trying to kill me. Today I'm going to kill you all! I've waited long enough for my revenge. Tsukamoto has already met his death. Takashi is next! Then, it's Taki! Finally, Lieutenant Onishi. Listen, I'm going to send you all to hell! I'll be pleased to escort you there myself! Hey, where is Ono? He was just here. I think he went to find the guy who left the tape. - What? Hey, let's call the police. - Shut up! What do you think would happen with the police? They'd find out about our setup. Well, let's cool off for now. That guy isn't some kind of monster we should fear. What's the matter? - The tape is gone! Bastard, who are you?! Lance Corporal Tsudo. You heard the tape, didn't you? I swore that I would make you all suffer. Then you'll know what it feels like to be killed! What's going on?! Damn it! That's the guy who stole my uniform! Kirioka! Call the station! Hello! Operator! This is headquarters... This is headquarters... Calling all cars... Calling all cars... We've received a report that the criminal broke through a roadblock in the Shibara Pier area. The criminal's considered armed and dangerous. The criminal's considered armed and dangerous. Car 24, roger! He went to the left! Stop! He couldn't have gone very far from here. Hey! Hey! Lady! Lady! Are you alright? Lady! Hang in there! Hey! Hey! Lady! Oh, Kirioka! Is she okay? - Yes. The man we're looking for is up there. He's trapped. Fire! Fire! Hey, what do you think it was? Well, I think it was a refrigeration unit. It looks like some kind of power generator as well. You don't seem to know very much about machines. Neither do you. Did you check with the building owners? They didn't seem to know very much about this. It's strange... Everything here is burnt to destruction. It must have been done to destroy clues. How is it? Find anything? No, nothing good. All we found was the uniform. What did you learn at the cabaret? The man who was killed there had an ID tag. Huh? Both of the men were killed with bayonets, and they both had ID tags. Those ID tags seem to act like a death sentence. I wonder if anyone else has these tags? What? You think there could be more murders? No! I don't want to die! I'm going to the police! - Fool! If you talk to them, you'll ruin everything we've done! But, I didn't have anything to do with his death! I... Who was the one who lit the dynamite? It was you. You're in this as much as we were. Do you still want to talk to the police now? Where are you going? No! I refuse to be chased all my life by him! I'm from the police. Please answer a few questions. I don't have anything to say to you. Your lives are in danger. Does that sound good to you? - Well, I... - Taki! We have nothing to say. Please leave. Onishi, what's the point in hiding things? You'll be dead if you don't tell us. Why won't you talk? - I don't know! There's nothing I can tell you! I know about the ID tags. Your waitress Tomi told me all about the delivery. Please listen. A policeman's job is more than arresting criminals. We also protect people when there is a need. How about it? Would you want to talk to us? - Well, I... - Do you want to talk? Taki... I'll tell them. It was fourteen years ago, August 15... ...the night of the surrender of Japan, and everything was in confusion. By the army's order, we were assigned to transport Dr. Nikki, an army scientist. We were to take him from Tokyo to a special mountain headquarters in Nagano... ...but we didn't do it. We took him to a different cave. There were five of us in all. Sergeant Tsukamoto, Doctor Nikki... Lance Corporal Tsudo was on duty. As well as Intelligence Officer Takashi, and myself. Taki was waiting for us outside of the cave. We had two boxes that were supposed to be full of Doctor Nikki's work... ...but in reality... Idiot! Look at what you made me do! - But sir, what is this?! Tsudo, hurry and put it back! Just a moment! Onishi, what is this? It's a supply of gold bars. What?! Then what about my research? - Doctor, Japan has lost the war. There's no further need for your research now. The surrender has made a big change. Money is the most important thing now. It's every man for himself. Bastard! - Traitors! You have betrayed the military! Bastard! This man is your superior! - This traitor is not my superior! This gold rightfully belongs to the people of our country! The surrender does not give you any right to betray their trust! Please take it back! What?! If you don't take them back, I swear that I will kill you! Hurry and get out! I've lit the fuse to the dynamite! Hurry! Get down! A year later, we got together... ... and went back to the cave to find the gold bars. But we couldn't find them. The bodies of Dr. Nikki and Lance Corporal Tsudo had both disappeared. That's impossible! - Could it have been the wrong cave? - No, I'm certain of it. Did you leave a visual marker for it? We'll we... It was there. It was there? What was it? It was Lance Corporal Tsudo's ID tag. His ID tag? He's after those guys, but it's their own fault. Hey, regardless of who they are, all human life is precious. Don't you think I know that? I guess that means Tsudo and Doctor Nikki are both alive. Well, it certainly appears that way. Hey, stop here for a moment. Well, what's this? I hope you don't mind me dropping in like this. - No. Please come in and have a seat. Well... Did you get over the shock of that night? - Yes, but I was really terrified when it happened. My legs were weak with fright. I'm really just a terrible weakling. Anyone would have been scared in a situation like that. I'd really like to thank you for your help. No... I'd also like to thank you for the flowers. The flowers... I hoped that you would like them. Do you have any family members? - Yes, they all live in the country. They don't know what happened. Really? Well... Well then, if you'll pardon me... Oh, I forgot to offer you some tea. I'm sorry. - It... it's alright. Some other time. - But, it's no trouble. - Really, it's okay. Yes? A delivery for you. - Oh, who could it be from? - Thank you! They're flowers from a customer of the company. Really? I was worried that they might be from a fellow rival. He visited me that morning to make sure his order of refrigeration units would be completed. Refrigeration units? That man will be missed. If he were still alive, these would have been his best years. So, why are you so interested in Dr. Nikki's work? I understand that you and Dr. Nikki were researching the same field. I want to talk about his work. This is the information I've gathered so far. Kajuro Nikki, born Meiji 31. Before the war, he studied in the field of electrical engineering. When the last war started, he joined the army technical laboratory... ...to study electrical weapons. He was reported missing after the war. He was a bachelor, and he was known as an ultra-nationalist. We would like to know more about Dr. Nikki's work on electrical weapons. You see, the reason why we're asking you involves the activity of a criminal. We're not sure, but we believe that the doctor's work... ...may be related to the murders we're investigating. Professor, please tell us. Kirioka and I worked together on an article that discussed the idea of stereophonic TV, remember? Yes. Dr. Nikki's research... ... was even more advanced than the studies being conducted today. Even if the work on the stereophonic TV was completed... ...the transmitted image could only be reproduced on a TV set. You see, through Dr. Nikki's work, he was trying to produce... ...a 3D image from a special transmitter. In other words, matter itself would be transmitted. When a person concentrates very intensely, he transmits brain waves. It's also known as telepathy. Now add to that, the coordination of the forces of mind and spirit. From that, teleport-telekinesis is created. Simply put... ...people and things could be transmitted through space using this concept. The advanced Yogi's of India believe it's one of the greatest mysteries ever demonstrated. That may be a secret of Yoga, Professor, but we can already travel in space. Their gods have nothing to do with it. But before the idea of space travel came along, wasn't it something only a god could do? However, with the advances we have made in science... ...mankind has discovered how to travel into space. Telepathy or teleport-telekinesis... ... can be amplified electrically, and can be transmitted as well. It's a complicated process... ...and would require a man of great genius to conceive and construct a machine for it. Hey, look at this. This is a tele-transmitting machine. This tower here looks just like this one. It does seem very similar, doesn't it? This part about the cooling system... I'm sure that it's an important clue as well. The Klyotron! It won't work unless it's at a constant low temperature! Don't forget the story about the cave... ...the criminal's strange color, his body... voice... When you put all of these facts together, it sounds like they're all connected in some way. Let's assume Dr. Nikki and Tsudo are still alive. The problem is, where are they now? Welcome back. Hey, I think they're at a place called Kotani. Kotani, you say? It's in Karuzawa. I know they purchased four refrigeration units recently from the Nippo Seiki Company. I heard it from Akiko. Oh, she's the girl we met recently. Why don't we go take a look around? We've got nothing to lose from it. Okay. Hello, is this the Nippo Seiki Company? I'd like to speak to Miss Chujo, please. Yes. What? She's gone to Kotani? She'll be leaving Ueno station at 12:15? Thank you. It's 11:47 now. We have about thirty minutes. Kobayashi, it finally came. Huh? - Taki got a tag with a note stating when he was going to die. When? - Today, between 11:30pm to midnight. I've got him under protection. Don't forget what I told you to say, I'm a repairman for the Nippo Seiki Company. Is that okay? - Yes. It's a little scary. - It's alright! It's alright! We're trying to locate the machines you want. So far we haven't been able to come up with a single thing. But we're still checking out every clue that you gave us. What's the situation with Taki? We've given him a police bodyguard for the moment. Do you mind if I look at the refrigeration units? You're very anxious to examine the cooling units. I wonder why that is? Well, it's my job with the company. He's with our "After-Service" station. I see... Unfortunately, I don't have a problem with any of the refrigeration units. All of the units are working perfectly. Then why did you call us out here? No, I only wanted to talk to Akiko Chujo. I didn't know my call would have caused so much trouble. Well, I can't let you go home this late at night. It would be very difficult. Well, I like to go to bed early. Please use these two rooms for your accommodations tonight. Well then, goodnight. Damn... I don't like anything about this place. Hey, I wonder if Dr. Nikki is here or if he's still alive. If he is, he's trying to avoid us. That guy's actions have certainly raised my suspicions. Well Akiko, try to get some sleep. - And you, Kirioka? I'm going to keep an eye on that guy. Nothing to report. Okasaki, thirty minutes to go. I'm scared, Kirioka. - What's the matter? Did you hear that noise? - Yes, it sounded like an earthquake. It was so strange... I know that nobody is around, but I feel like I'm being watched. You're not tired enough to sleep yet? What was that noise? Oh, that noise came from the volcano. It's become quite active recently. It could erupt at any time. - Delivery? - Yes. Okay. Taki, try to relax a little bit. Sure. You'll be okay. We've got policeman posted inside and outside in the yard around the place. Nobody's going to get by all the men we have here. What's inside the crate? I think it's some kind of machine. What? A machine? - It's probably a construction machine. It was ordered by the Taki Construction Company for delivery tonight. Okay, let's go there together. I'm back. There's a large truck with a machine for delivery. Huh? The driver said that it was to be delivered tonight. No, I didn't order it! Kobayashi, let's check it out. The invoice, please. What in the world could it be? You should stay indoors, please. - Quickly! - Sure. Where is the policeman who came with you? He was just here a moment ago. How about it officer? Like a drink? Damn it! Okasaki, it's a trick! What? That way! Damn it! We should have caught him! Alright! Let's try to catch him now! Hey, what do you see? Not much, but I can see someone. - Really? I see you two are inspecting things. Please return to your beds. Chief... I want to search the Kotani ranch thoroughly. I agree, but the suspect had a perfect alibi. We can't sit around and wait for the next murder to happen. We've lost two policemen already! Do you have any evidence to prove that Goro Nakamoto is Lance Corporal Tsudo? Well, that is... - I believe the two men are the same. You said his alibi was perfect... ...since he was seen between 11:30 and 12:00. But this was to set up an alibi. Don't forget the machine we found at the train wreck. After all, it was the same type found at the first fire. Therefore, I'm convinced that this is no coincidence. Kirioka... ... did you happen to see anyone there that might have resembled Dr. Nikki? Yes, I'm sure I saw someone down there... ...but I can't be sure if it was the doctor or not. They must have suspected us though. All of the doors that led to the lab were locked tight. Is that so? However, none of us would really know what Dr. Nikki looks like. I believe that Professor Mura would recognize him if he saw him. You would have made a good detective. Any suggestions? Give us a search warrant. That way we'll find out what their machines are all about. Chief! Onishi seems to have disappeared. Boss, I hope you don't plan on fishing. Whatever you say. It looks like some bad weather is blowing in. - Buddy, we'll sit out a typhoon! Well, well... It's good to see you again! You can go home. We'll be fine. - Really? Well, then... Boss, why did we come out here? This place gives me the creeps. You'd better have a seat, and then I'll tell you why. There is a man after me. Who is it? - The bayonet murderer. I doubt he'll be able to find me here. Excuse me... Wha... what is it, woman? Yes, I almost forgot to tell you. A letter arrived yesterday addressed to the master. - What? "The day after tomorrow, I will kill you at noon."- Lance Corporal Tsudo Leave! Please go home! Nakamoto... No, I'm not sure of I should call you that, or Lance Corporal Tsudo. Who is this Tsudo? I don't know him! I'm sure that you know who that person is. I'm also sure that you're the bayonet murderer. Stop with the jokes. What evidence do you have to support your charges? If you're Tsudo, we'll find out soon enough. We have a search warrant for your house. Step aside. Let them come in and look around, please. That voice? Sorry for the misunderstanding. Well, please look around. Nikki! It's you, isn't it, Nikki? It's me! It's Mura! Mura?! It is you, Nikki! You're still alive? What happened to your legs? This is what happened when some fools blew up the cave after the war. Why didn't you tell me you were alive? I would have helped you. The nation that I knew had been shattered. I felt that I was no longer wanted. Dr. Nikki... Have you completed your work on the matter-transmitting machine? Who are you? This is a student I taught. He works as a journalist. Now, about your research... Yes, it's almost complete. Do you know what this is? It looks like a kind of vacuum tube. What is it? It is used in the process of matter transmission. It melts like this when the electric waves get agitated. As a result, the image can become distorted. Then that's why we thought... ...the face of the killer looked strange. I'm sure he used a device like that. Killer? - That's right. It's Nakamoto. Did you find him? - No, but someone else is coming. Oh, that's Detective Morane. Morane! Did you happen to pass by anyone? No, I didn't see anyone. Okasaki, I've got a message from Tokyo headquarters... ...that Onishi wants police protection. - Onishi?! Where is he? He's on an island near the Murazaki Peninsula. The killer's note said that his sentence would be carried out by noon today. I knew Tsudo was using my electric machinery, but not as a tool for murder. Incredible... I can't believe a man would use it for that purpose. That man is very clever. He appeared in Tokyo while he pretended he was still here. He set up a perfect alibi for himself. I still believe Tsudo will use the electric machinery to finish the job. He'll be in Murazaki by noon. I think that we should head out there. We may find a way to head him off. Nikki, I want you to come with me, for your own good. I'll be alright. I'm used to being on my own here. Besides, all of my work is here, so please go ahead. The typhoon is currently expected to bypass the Japan mainland. Strong winds and dangerous seas will be a result of the typhoon... ... as it makes its way past Western Japan. Residents within the danger zone are asked to secure their homes and any boats for the storm. Boss, we don't need the police with this incoming typhoon. Boss, there's no way a boat can make it in these rough seas. No, that guy will come here. But really, boss... Hey! The typhoon is going to pass us! The weather is still bad enough. I'm just doing this to be safe. The owner of the cottages is here tonight, huh? Yes, but we won't be going fishing tonight in weather like this. By the way... ...did you tell him about the package that arrived from Tokyo not too long ago? I forgot to tell him today. I was going to tell him tomorrow. I put it in the shed with the fishing net, so please be sure to tell him tomorrow. I wish we didn't have this typhoon to deal with. Yes, but at least it's getting better. Hey, how long to get to Murazaki? We should be there around 11:00. That's about twenty minutes. Hey, is something on your mind bugging you? Yes, I think our man really didn't escape... ...just so he could return to the laboratory. The transmitter? That's crazy! - Inspector Hondo. - Thank you for coming. Have you had any luck finding the man we described? - We thought we'd find him easily in a small town like this, but we couldn't. I believe he isn't here. What about the island? There are about twenty houses on it... ...but no boats are heading out to it due to the typhoon. I'm sure that no boats went out there today. Could you search all the warehouses and check for any strange machinery? You haven't found it? - Not anything unusual... We have twenty minutes left. Get us a boat right away. - Yes, I'll get it at once. I'll assemble a special guard for you. - No. The murderer isn't a normal human. This man has no heart. He's a devil with electricity running through his veins instead of blood! Tsudo... it's you! I didn't run away like everyone thought. I hid myself in a room that even you don't know about. Tsudo, I no longer want you as my assistant! Leave my laboratory now! I understand. Wait! Don't touch that! How can you do this? Shut up! Boss! A boat is coming in! What?! I can't tell if it's the police. Hey, go and find out! Damn it! Where could he be? Outside! Forgive me! Stop, Tsudo! Tsudo, there's nowhere to run. - You think so, huh? Damn! Could he be in there? Kobayashi, what's that noise? Hey! Something's wrong! THE END
