Chaitra, please! Give it a second thought. I neither have the patience nor the interest anymore. It's over. Please, Chaitra. If you leave me, you'll just prove how unlucky I am. You know what, Vicky? You better stop using bad luck as an excuse. Because Luck... favors only the brave! Chaitra! ‘That must have hurt.’ ‘But his face still looks cute.' ‘Don’t assume it's the first time.' ‘This happened 1116 times so far.’ ‘And he makes the same face every single time.' ‘You should know his story to understand why.’ ‘Listening to a religious story brings us good luck.' ‘Listening to a story of bravery brings us courage.' ‘But his story is full of misfortune. Be prepared.’ Come on. Take a deep breathe. You do it. You’ll know how I feel. I'll do it when I need to. I can't skip it. Bah! Your boy is curling up out of fear as we try to get him out. He doesn’t cooperate at all. Doctor! I’ve been carrying the baby for 10 months now. I will file a case on you if you don’t deliver the baby. Doctor! Figure something out and pull him out, please . O’ Lord! What happened, sir? Surgery! [KUMARI SCREAMS] What’s all the fuss about? Did someone die? No… Some film shooting. Who is the heroine? Our favorite Ramya Krishna. Ramya? [MUMBLING] [KUMARI SCREAMS] [VOICE]: ‘Having no idea whom to blame Ramya Krishna or his whim.’ ‘He resents time and his son who was born at that time.’ ‘After all, he took 10 years to recover.’ Ouch! I keep getting hurt all the time. Open the door, dad. Dad. ‘He recovered from the illness after 10 years.’ ‘But, he couldn’t escape his son's misfortune. My son is kind of powerful. I can see that. Your son’s horoscope is… It spells Misfortune! Extreme misfortune! I've neither come across such a bad horoscope till now... - Nor will you do in future? What if we send him far away? No! You cannot escape his influence even if you get rid of him. Will any of the rituals help? Meeting some people brings luck. Witnessing God brings enlightenment. If you look at him, meet him or touch him… You will be doomed completely. Hello, son! Mom? When? With whom? Oh my! Mom? Let’s go. [VOICE]: ‘The news from the astrologer’s house, soon spread around.’ ‘Everyone believed it is unlucky to see Vicky.’ ‘His life has turned worse than than a black cat.’ We shifted to a new place. Let’s see if his fate changes. Mom. [VOICE]: ‘Moving to a new place did nothing to Vicky’s fate.’ 'His bad luck travels faster than him And teases him. Mom! I will also come with you. Sorry, dear. We are attending a holy ritual. I will take you next time. Mom! Please, mom. Please. No, dear. They will blame us if the wedding gets cancelled. Please. I will get bored if I stay alone. Count the stars! We’ll be back soon. - Let's go. - Yeah. Okay, dear... Food is in the fridge. Eat your food and play. Okay? Don't you dare do any mischief while I'm away. Hey, wait. Hey, you… I said stop. So, your problem is your bad luck. Hmmm. Will you come with me? Will you drop me back home? Okay. Start! D6 to D7! E8 to A4! Is it nice? Did you make it? Is it magic? I only made it. But it is no magic. It’s science. There's no magic or superstition involved. …Except for questions and answers. Can I take this home? - This one is enough? - It'll do for now. And later? You might lose it. ...or it might be ruined. What will you do then? You’ll only have this if you take it from me. But what if you make one? I should make it? You think I can do it? You can do it if you set your mind to it. Just try and see. Give it a shot. Think about it! Wow. All you need is a little belief, son. You shouldn’t use science to control or destroy life. You must use it only to make the world better. So, promise me. Promise. [VOICE]: ‘He didn't get a thing the old man was saying.’ ‘But, Vicky never felt alone after that day.’ ‘He didn't realize the deeper meaning behind this acquaintance ‘And the complications it would bring in the future.’ Poor guy. Hey! What happened? It's stuck. Shoot! I was about to win. Damn! It is not in your nature to win. It's in your fate. Nonsense! It's time for that change astrologer mentioned. I'll go to any lengths to change my fate. Buddy... Even God can’t help you with your fate. But I like your dedication. Let’s see how your fate will change. Hold on. - Who do you think will win the toss? - KKR! I bet 1000 rupees on CSK. See. Nothing changed. Hey! Hey! Hey! -Cute boy! -You think that's cute? Ah, come on! Tell me who will win the match. Stop. No entry for half an hour. Why? What is it this time? It's elimination day in the Big Boss show. If my favorite person should stay in that house... You shouldn’t enter this house for a while. For a stupid TV show? I wish no one has to put up with a mom like you. Okay. I hope no one is as unlucky as you are. I don't complain, do I? - Oh My luck depends on your luck. Like father, like son! - Dad. - Why are you shouting? Of course, I'll shout. Don’t shout. Lower your voice. Did you even hear what she said? I did. There is nothing wrong in what she said. She knows your power. She was just being cautious. What power, dad? You make it sound like I'm responsible for all the mishap in the world. Aren't you responsible? Did you forget what happened to me after your birth? Look at my mouth! It became crooked. I was a little baby back then, dad. This flower spilled fragrances as soon as it bloomed. Will you just let me live my life, dad? You let me live mine. Shit! Nonsense! Like father, like son, huh? Not this time. Varahamurthy is above all this. Why isn't she here yet? She's so cute. Chaitra... I'm in love with her since the past 4 years. From a distance. I need guts to approach her. And for that, I need my fate to change. I wonder when it will change. My foot! Why will it change now, when it hasn't for all these years? Never. You play pubG, okay? Let’s make a tiktok video. My followers will increase. [VOICE]: ‘Vicky’s life will change just like he wanted.’ ‘But, not very soon.’ ‘Life is a bundle of many stories.’ ‘There's a story Vicky doesn't know about.' 'A story he is bound to complete.' 'Has taken shape long back.' Damn! [SCREAMS] Welcome, boss! Sir. I don't remember the years passed by... But the woes continue to hurt. These surroundings and the scent remind me of everything. You stole my project. You made me a mad man. Did you think that I wouldn’t come? Prof. Acharya! I am back. The world is an asylum and I am the mad scientist! Wow! Dang it! - Wow! - What happened? - Take a look, sir. - What? Every loser out there is updating his relationship status on Facebook. Except you and me! Those times have passed for me. I’m out of service. If you keep waiting for it to happen... You will also end up like me. I am worried about the same. You said that you like someone. What’s her name? Chaitra. Chaitra… Chaitra… Nice girl. Why don’t you propose her? I could... - But… - But, what? I am scared. Scared about what? I am scared that she will not accept me. Even if I manage to convince her... I’m scared that she'll leave me once she knows how unlucky I am. Whoa! That thought keeps haunting me. That is good... Good for you. What?! How is failure good for me? I didn't mean that. I meant it's good to be scared. The one who fears losing something... Also has it in his might to protect it. No matter how cautious I am... My fate is always up for ruining everything. Hey! If you really love her... And if she reciprocates the same... None of this can stop you. My fate included? Love is the strongest belief, Vicky. This so called superstition can't stand a chance. Sounds good… - But… - Why are you still hesitant? You know… Life is fragile, Vicky. If you keep waiting for right moment... It will pass even before you realize it. And before you comprehend it... You lose the chance to grab it. You never know. Life might end in the blink of an eye. So you should express what you feel. You should do what you want. You should make the most of every moment. -You think so? - Yes. - Stop waiting and go tell her. - I will tell her. I will tell her tomorrow. Keep supporting me. No one can stop me. - Master… where are you going? - I will see you tomorrow… I will see you tomorrow! [DOOR KNOCK] - Move! - Hey… Who are you? Huh? Hey! We are Dada’s accomplices. Who’s that Dada? Look there. Greetings... Which way is the bathroom? Forgive me. I am diabetic. I need to pee at least once an hour. - You must be knowing. - Who the hell are you? Why didn't you tell him about me while I was peeing? Were you holding it in? Sorry, bro. Sorry, sir. Myself Dada... Your old friend sent me. Who’s that old friend? [GIBBERISH] Is he deaf? A little... You have to adjust. Do you remember something when you see this? Seems like his face turned pale. He must have remembered his past. Your past haunts you, sir. - What do you want? - You have a disk, right? That man seems crazy. Listen to me and give it to him. I am here for you. -Get lost! Get out! See... I can't help you professionally. But, we can become partners if you keep an open mind. Okay… Go on, tell me. This girl! She’s my daughter. Nice meeting you, sir. How did you get my daughter’s picture? Stupid question! Its from here. My men brought it to me last night. Why do you need her picture? - This is the right question. -Then, answer the bloody question. Because... I love your daughter. I want to marry her. What the hell are you saying? How can you love my daughter? What do you mean by how? It’s love, sir. I just fell for her. Is he just deaf or crazy as well? Why are you talking to him? Talk to me. What should I talk to you about, huh? Talk about the wedding. I don’t have any elders in the family. I wasn't expecting anyone elder than you, that to be honest. Shall we fix the date? How old are you? Get out, everyone! Let’s go, guys. Come. He is already deaf. Tell me. How old are you? I'm not sure, sir. What was the first movie you saw? ‘Moogamanasulu’, sir! Idiot. I was only 6 years old when that movie released. How can you possibly think of marrying my daughter? Do you have any common sense? Hey, Professor! Don’t treat me like a fool just because I am being polite. Dada! It is no big deal to put you down just like I did with your house. But, I'm not here to fight. I'm here to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. I’m giving you one week time… After that, even if you like it or not... I’ll take away the hard disk and your daughter. See you soon. Uncle. Why are you so excited? I'm going to control my fate today. Oh! So you decided to make a fool out of yourself. No. I decided not to remain a fool. What’s the plan? Simple! I’ll storm in and propose Chaitra without any fear. - All the best. - Thank you. There she is… I mean Chaitra. Seems your energy levels are down. I crashed in to a glass. Your dignity is safe at least. Listen to me and drop this. No, man... Try and try till you fly. It’s die, I think. Because I am trying to fly but not to die. Oh my Michelle Francis! Look. Chaitra is coming. Hi. Oh! Thank you. What's with the flower in your hand? I'm talking to you! Answer me. Physics! [COUGHS] Do you have physics notes, sister? How dare you call me sister! What happened to your wings? My fate crushed them. You know what? That’s fate bro. In your situation, it is much worse. Listen to me and give this up. No, man. Not this time. You will never understand. Never. You are the one who should understand. All I need is a change in my life. And I will bring that change. He’s talking about change like a politician. Stop! Stop right there. I cannot express myself if I look into your eyes. I cannot stop myself from looking at you either. But I have to say it. I like you. If you have the same feelings for me... Will you stand by me forever? I will. I will be with you forever. I will hold your hand and never let go. I will not leave you even if you try to go away. Why do you interrupt my dialogue all the time? Damn! I will never act again. Fate! Sorry! I was just rehearsing. I also rehearsed it before. But, I never got the chance to say it. - I am really sorry. - It's okay. I am used to it. I came here to say something. But something else happened. - Don’t feel so bad. - Okay. I am sorry if I troubled you. I will see you in the next life if my fate ever changes. See you. Vicky! I can't make it sound as dramatic as the dialogue. But I can do better if you give me some time. I've always wanted to say it, you know. It won't take much longer. What?! You want me to say everything here? They are watching us. Let them see. Say it. Let’s get out of here. “I had a lovely dream that touched my heart” “There’s been a strike at this moment” “There is oxygen in all directions” “But, this feeling takes away my breath” “An implicit love is now expressed” “I thought she would not agree” “But, this lady accepts my love” “My dream comes true all of a sudden” “Takes me to a long drive” “She just blew my mind” “She just blew my mind” “Oh my God! Such a handsome guy” “Oh my God! Such a handsome guy” “He embraces me with a sweet gesture” “This smart guy with bad luck” “He’s got lucky and has become mine” “Nothing can stop him now” "This guy...” No recording. You’re always on your phone! Instagram, selfies and all! You literally have nothing else to do. Don’t record, Chaitra. Stop acting like a child. - Are you okay? - Chaitra! “I feel like I am on cloud 9” “I'm congratulating myself” “In my journey with her…” “I came across many good signs” “My fate changes with this sweet heart’s bonding” “My luck takes a new turn” “I suddenly started liking me” “She just blew my mind” “She just blew my mind” “Oh my God! Such a hesitant guy” “Oh my God! Such a hesitant guy” “He’s deeply in love now” “He managed to make me fall in love” “This is how the story goes along together..." "My life!” I want to see you in a saree. “My Lord! Administer this floret” “My Lord! Administer this floret” “With a glint, you are the master of God’s army” “My Lord! Administer this floret” “With a glint, you are the master of God’s army” “My Lord! Administer this floret” What happened? I am scared. About what? About you. What? Nothing good ever happened in my life. Even if it did, something bad would soon follow. And... You are the best thing that ever happened to me. That is why I am worried about what might happen in life. Because... I don’t want to lose you. Like... Ever! You won’t. You know… For the first time in my life... I feel so lucky. Being here... With you... Just to look into your eyes... And take a deep breath. Err... I am so sorry. Hey! Look at this. Chaitra! - Do you remember this video? - Hey! Why did you upload it? I did not. In fact, I'm seeing it for the first time. How is it possible? Hey! I don’t know. Chaitra! Please delete that video. No way. See? So many people watched the video. Look at the number of views. You are viral! -Bah! You know I don’t like all this. Please. There is no way I am deleting this... - Chaitra! Please. Please…Please… Fine! Okay. Thank you. - Let’s take a picture. - No! - Come - No! Come. Come. Come on! Professor! Professor... Hey! -Whoa! Sir. It’s me. - What are you doing here? - As usual, just a casual visit. What happened? Why aren’t you answering my calls ? I didn’t check. - Why aren’t you attending college? - I am in a bad mood. What's wrong, sir? Why are you so...? What are these boxes? Professor! Is it a new experiment? You didn’t even tell me. Hey! What is your problem? Acting like an annoying TV reporter! What are you doing here? Are you seriously asking me that again? When did we ever need a reason to meet? Well, we need a reason from now on. Do you have one? No! I just came to check on you. Thanks for your concern. I'll shut the door if you please leave. Why are you acting weird? No one's going to give a damn if you act like this. - Hey! Go. - Hey. - Go! - Sir. He's so drunk! Old man has lost his mind. Damn it! Bye, dad. Whoa! Saree to impress him? Dad, please! Listen. I can understand if he's an innocent guy. We can also tolerate a misfit. But, how can we handle misfortune? You don’t have to handle him. If you are so scared, I will keep him away from you I will also stay away. Why are you getting angry? I will obviously get angry if you keep repeating the same thing. And we'll obviously be worried about you. You're right. But it's not necessary. He is a good guy, dad. He is crushed since everyone blames him about his bad luck. He is not confident about himself. Do you get it? I can see that you understood him very well. He is so lucky. See, that is what I am talking about. All he needs is a break. And I want to be that break for him. That’s what love should do, right? Make people better. Okay. Why are you moody? I am disturbed. What is it this time? Too much sarcasm! Who's being sarcastic? Why will I have a problem if it’s someone else? What is your problem anyway? Why did you delete that video? You were really upset about it. So I deleted it. If you cared about me so much, why did you upload it? Who told you I did it? Like I said, I have no idea who uploaded it. You must have done it. Or someone else must've done it from your phone. No one touches my phone, Vicky. That's my point. What do you mean? Why are you being so fussy? I'm not being fussy. I'm really upset. Whatever! See... I am not important to you. I am only as important as a Whatsapp forward to you. My life is a form of entertainment to you. And my troubles... They give you loads of joy. You make me follow you around. Because you enjoy that attention. I am an unlucky fellow, right? You've taken me for granted. Vicky! You’re crossing your limit. You will regret it later. What the hell! Let me regret it. I just hope I'm not a joke to you. I can’t believe I have to deal with this right now. I've taken a lot of shit from you. I've put up with so much for you. - I fought for you with my dad. - So did you put up with me? What all did you put up with? Enlighten me. Want me to tell you? Do you really want to know? Tell me. Let’s settle this today. Fine... Let’s do this. 5 minutes… [DOORBELL] - Why are you late? - Sorry, Chaitra… Let’s go. Okay, let’s go. - Hi, uncle. We meet finally. - Hi.... How are you? - Give me a minute. – Yeah. It's an important call, I guess. Oh shit! Is that why he didn’t meet me that day? There’s more to it. My granny saw you drop me home that day. Remember? Yes. After that... She died. In the time between seeing you and her dying... We almost lost all our assets. Why are you still hanging out with him? We almost lost everything. But we didn't, right? Why are you being so arrogant? You met him and it led to this. Imagine what would happen if you married him. Granny… I wasn't aware of any of this. - There’s more... - That’s enough. Stop it. Please. I am sorry, Chaitra. She’s old. Her death was kind of obvious. I thought the same. I also fought with my dad for you. I don't have to do that anymore. Chaitra! I am sorry. Too late, Vicky. You showed up late once. You dropped me late the other day. Out of fear. You took too long to realize your mistake this time. Out of ego. I told you you will regret it. - No, Chaitra. - No, Vicky. Everyone around you said you're responsible for the chaos in your life. But, I gave you the benefit of the doubt. I understood that you're victim of your own fate. I stood by you in your fight. But, you know what? You don’t deserve any of this. Chaitra. I made a mistake. Yes, it is over. No one can change the past. I really thought I would be your break. But, you know what? I am done. I am breaking up with you. Breakup?! Chaitra! You're just proving how unlucky I am by breaking up with me. You know what, Vicky? You better stop using bad luck as an excuse. Because lucky... favors only the brave! Chaitra. ‘This is the story so far.’ ‘Getting slapped by a girl is different from getting slapped by others.’ ‘I can't help it if he still doesn't change his ways.' ‘Oh! I didn’t introduce myself, right?’ My name is... Luck. I agree this is bad luck. [OLD SONG on TV] Sorry. [OLD SONG on TV] [OLD SONG on TV] Why are you so dull? Chaitra broke up with me. It's okay... It's great she put up with you for so long. No one cares about me, right? Son! I was just saying the truth. Listen to me, Vicky. I said it casually. I didn’t mean to hurt you. Open the door. Please. Vicky. Hubby! Hubby! What? Come here. Ah! He fought with her... He got angry and locked himself inside. I am scared he might hurt himself. He can't hurt himself even if he tried. Because he is a lucky fellow. Wait. Vicky… Vicky... Hey. One minute. What? Are you here to witness my sorrow. It's okay... I'll talk to him. What happened? Why are you annoyed with me since my childhood? Why is this world against me? Chaitra left me pointing out bad luck on my face. It's my fault if the neighbor has a broken tooth. It's my fault if some guy hurts his leg. How is it my fault if her granny dies from old age? I was blamed for everything ever since I was a kid. I tolerated all the bullying I was subjected to. I endured humiliation. But when I'm told I'm not even worthy of love... It makes me really sad, dad. Someone like me... Does someone like me deserve to live? Shall I tell you the truth? In my life, good and bad, happened because of you only. Did something good happen to you because of me? Man considers every good thing in his life as his right. But when something goes wrong, he questions it. And if nothing happens, he blames it on God or evil. We found you vulnerable. So we blamed you. I don’t know, dad. It feels so true when everyone keeps saying it. I am skeptical about myself. The world has a lot to say. But you should trust yourself. You should have a person who trusts you. Chaitra trusted you. She looked beyond the misfortune and saw in you the other side. She saw the real you. She is your lucky charm. Don’t lose her. Professor. Hello? Hello. Disturbance. Hello. I will meet him, dad... It has been many days. Professor! You! Are you okay? Dad. Sir… Sir! - Dad. - Sir… - Get up, sir. - Vicky! They are coming. Take Maya with you. Take her away... Sir! Nothing will happen to you, sir. Hey! Where is the girl? - There’s no girl in here. - Search for the girl! Where is the girl? Search for her. What's happening here? Who are they? I don’t know. Why are they chasing you? I don’t know. When did you return from the US? It has been 2 days. As far as I know, Professor doesn’t have enemies. - Did they come for you? - I don’t know. Why do you keep repeating the same thing? What is this, dad? She is already terrified. Kumari. Come with me. - You have to say something. - Hush! She is still in shock. You are terrified yourself. Imagine how she must have felt. Try and figure out why Professor called you in such a situation. Take care of her. Okay? Maya... Aren’t you feeling sleepy? Why did people choose the night to sleep? Darkness! May be we fear darkness. We cannot escape it no matter what. Fear, sadness, emptiness are all it’s agents. It might take over us in any form. When it does... We should come out of it like rays of sunshine. But we shouldn’t give up sleeping. Did my dad tell you anything about me? He used to. He always spoke about your happiness. It is not fair to him if he becomes the reason behind your sadness now. I mean, the whole point is lost, right? He never liked it when someone was sad because of him. Maybe that is why... He kept his distance with me lately. But I failed to understand him. Yes... He doesn’t like sorrow. Who cleaned up this mess? Hubby… Hubby! Why are you not responding? Nothing. Just recalling the losses incurred due to our son. You can do that later. Something is wrong in our house. Come. I will show you. Let’s go… See. I get it now. Don't you? This is how people in America function. They do their own chores. She did all our work as well. Don’t tell our son about it. Let’s go. Come on. What’s up, mother? Looks like you are having a good time. Are you done with all the work? All the work is done. That new girl did it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have so much free time on my hand. New girl? What’s with the new girl? I mean, Maya. She did everything before I even woke up. I didn’t ask her to do any of it. How can you make her do the work? Are you out of your mind? She’s new here. How can you? Why are you taking the trouble? You only told me that my dad would want me to move on. So I thought it's better to keep my mind occupied. Okay, thank you. Shoot in that gap. Take position. Quick. Sir... How did you confirm it as an accident? Forensics department confirmed it. - Did you find any…? - Focus while you're at it. Sir! Did you find anything suspicious? We checked. Nothing was suspicious. Lodge a complaint if you feel so. We'll look into it. It's just a waste of time. Who is he? We got him here because he was enquiring at the police station. - Why were you there? - My Professor is missing. I went to enquire. Why doesn't he buy a hearing aid already? I can’t bend anymore. [GIBBERISH] What’s the relation between you and the professor? We were childhood friends... I know him since I was a kid. But there’s a generation gap between you two. That’s a long story. So do you know the Professor very well? Yeah. You can say that. Guys... Get him a chair. Do you know anything about his daughter? Why are you interested in her? Why do you care? Chief! He’s young. He might help you impress her. The thing is I love that girl. Oh! What?! Love?! - Why are you shocked? - I mean, the age difference... Her dad can be your childhood friend. But she can't be my lover, huh? She could be. Good logic! Unconventional love stories are in trend now, sir. I watched ‘Cheeni Kam’ movie 30 times. That movie is my inspiration. Super, sir! Amazing selection. So will you help me out? Bro! You got my full support. I'll come to you as soon as I have any information on her. Can I leave now? Sure… Off you go. Hey! Put that down already. - Drop him in our vehicle. - See you, bro. Thanks, buddy. No need to thank me. Just buy a hearing aid. It's a request. Nice tea... Thank you. Chaitra! I can't believe you came for me! Don’t get excited. I didn't come here for you. There you are. I was waiting for you since morning. - Yeah. - Do you want some water? No, thanks. I brought some clothes for you. For me? - Thank you. - Yeah. I'll come back. Chaitra… Chaitra… Wait, Chaitra. Chaitra, wait. Why did you come? Why are you leaving? We are planning to organize Professor’s memorial. I'm here to inform you. You could've called me or simply send me a text. Oh! Are you here to see me? You’ve got high expectations on yourself, huh? Don't flatter yourself. Chaitra, wait. I somehow feel that Chaitra still loves you. I doubt it, mom. She knows how unlucky I am. A little too well actually. I don’t know about that. But she was jealous when Maya hugged you. - Hmm? - Hmm. She is jealous. Yes. “I’ll hold you, I’ll get you” “I’ll throw you out” “I’ll scold you, I’ll smack you” “I’ll drive you out of here” “With your evil magic” “You lured my lover towards you” “He’s the one I kissed before you got here” “You’re dreaming with a guy who was mine” “You feel so happy thinking that you got a chance” “You aimed to stay beside him and you remained” “You cunning woman!” “He’s my own lover!” “Don’t touch him” “No… No! Never!!” “Go far from here and never come back” “You can’t become alike with cappuccino coffee” “You can’t form a bond with just a movie together” “Stop enticing him, wily woman” “This is my warning, I'll destroy you” “I am girl like you...” “So, I will not pick up a fight with you” “I will spare you if you apologize” “You cunning woman!” “He’s my own lover” “Don’t touch him” “No…No! Never” “Go far from here and never come back” “You took a chance because I am a cool person” “You got closer to my lover boy” “He’s my lovely guy” “He started liking you” “What’s special in you that lacks in me?” “If I see the guy who sent you here…” “I will bash him up right now in front of you” “You cunning woman!” “He’s my own lover” “Don’t touch him” “No…No! Never” “Go far from here and never come back” Mr. Acharya was a man of excellence. The services he rendered for the institution are priceless. But unfortunately, we lost him in accident. So, if you wish to say your final goodbyes… Grab your pens. Open your hearts. Get writing and set the balloons free into the sky. Life is very fragile, Vicky... If you keep waiting for the right moment... It will pass even before you realize it. And before you comprehend it... You lose the chance to grab it. Chaitra. Chaitra. Oh! Maya. Who are you? Dada’s accomplices? Yes. Why did you gang up on me? Hey... You said you don’t know her when we asked you earlier. I lied to you. So what? Hey! Lets break his bones and take her with us. Babe... Go and sit. You know what's going to happen? This beard guy... Will have his back broken. What should I do with the second guy? I’ll give you a flying kick. Coming to the third guy, I will smack him up badly. I will throw him off like a backpack. Hey… Hey… Who says we're going to attack one by one? We will surround you and beat you up. Ready? Why did people choose the night to sleep? - Why are they chasing you? - I don’t know. Did my dad tell you anything about me? - Why are they chasing you? - I don’t know. Did my dad tell you anything about me? Why do you keep repeating the same answer? Did my dad tell you anything about me? Why do you keep repeating the same answer? - Who are they? - I don’t know. Don’t talk anything before that guy. Let me talk. - Yes, chief. - Let’s go. Where is this crazy guy? Wait. Wait. Where are you both going? - Where is that crazy guy? - He’s inside. Go search for yourself. Wait… Only two people are allowed. You guys wait here. - Let’s go. - Go, go… - You guys want to box? - Come on. Let's fight. Come! Sir?! Where is the crazy guy? Sir. Sir. He’s here!! He brought it. Where is my hard disk? My time has finally come. I will show them my power. I will finish everyone. Actually I came here to tell you that only. I need some more time. What? You didn’t find it? No. We searched professor’s entire house. We are also searching for his daughter. We might get some information if we find that girl. Same to same! Talk. I mean I need some time to find his daughter. What, sir? Are you making fun? Shut up! Shut up! I didn’t find it… I need some more time…. Did I hire you to hear that from you? You fool! I hired you so that you will work for me. I tried, sir. There is no value for an experiment in this great world. Why will there be a value for trying? Constipation crisis? Oh! That’s the problem. Empty! Everything is empty. Totally empty... Damn! Full! It is full. That’s it. It is my mistake to hire you. It is my mistake... Daughter’s picture! Do you have that professor's daughter’s picture? Yes. I have it. - Good. - Send it via whatsapp. Okay, chief. Whatsapp! I sent it. Check... I sent it. I got it. - You are fired. - Fired? - Out! - Out? Out! - What happened? - Let’s go. He is stumbling. Where is my hard disk? Where is my hard disk? Useless fellows! All you do is to eat Biryani and drink beer. Why are you scolding us, chief? I thought he’s the only one. Are you also shouting on me? Tell me that you found her at least. Someone bashed everyone who went in search of her. They’re not in a position to talk. Please. Find her fast. We should find her before this crazy guy. - Okay, come. - Hey, move. I will kick you both into the air far from this place. Hey! What is this? Enough fighting. Move! Hey! Are you here to eat? Let’s go. Come. Come. What? Nothing. It’s okay. You can ask me. So you are not human? Can’t you see? The professor locked himself for days and I thought he turned insane due to his age. So... This is what he did. When did he create you? I was initiated two days before the accident. Why wasn’t I told about this? That’s for my safety. How did you manage before everyone? My mind was designed to work just like a human brain. To be precise, he replicated professor daughter’s Neural data. And my code is installed with Adaptive Learning Technology. Are you Maya? Almost! Can you do everything that a human can do? Are you really a robotic student? Okay… I just asked casually. I can do some. I can do anything that a human can’t do if you write a program. Then... What about feelings and emotions? I have them. But they’re programmed and controlled. Do you have all emotions? Except pain! You are very lucky. We are screwed most of the time because of that. This is awesome. So, you are not Maya. No. Can you do me a favor? You know Chaitra, right? This frustrated girl? Yeah! This frustrated girl. I like her a lot. But… Does she hate you? No…She likes me too but she is angry with me. What did you do? - That’s a long story. - What should I do? Nothing... She thinks that there is something between us. So, will you act like my girlfriend in front of her? You know what I mean, right? I know but... Why should I act like your girlfriend? Why couldn’t I really become your girlfriend? Why did you get that doubt? Casually! I asked because you said so. Oh! Okay. So, let me rephrase it. Can you act like you’re closer to me in front of Chaitra? Will this closeness be enough? Yeah. But Chaitra is not here now. So... No need. Okay. Dude. I think the washroom is that way. You won’t understand human problems. Karun? Hey. Whoa... Whoa... Relax brother. What is this look? What’s wrong with you, man? Why are you with Chaitra? Well, she’s going through a breakup. …and I am trying to help her. It doesn’t look like you are helping her... It's like you are playing with me. Me? With you? Come on, buddy. God Himself has been playing with your life for the past 23 years Hey! Why did you change like this? With Time… Change is inevitable, bro. Everyone will change. Except you. Karun! What are you doing there? Baby! Order for the drinks... I’ll be there in a sec. My dad told me to stay away from unlucky people. Man up, bro! Don’t be a crybaby… Come on. Oh! Wow… What’s up, babe? What are we doing today? I’ll smack you if you touch me... Go and sit there. What happened? Shut up and go. Are you dating him now? And you are dating her now? You know, we both are best Tik Tok couple. Shall we start? - I am waiting. - Hashtag! #Me too. Look at him… Go for it… Damn my luck! Yes! Loser! It should happen to you. Come on, my girl... Come on! It's okay. How? Yes. Yes! Whoa! Yes. Whoa... Yay! Yes! We won. - Damn! These balls. “I’ve locked you in my eyes” “You can never escape” “I don’t even apply mascara” “As it might smudge you” “To add sweetness to my lips” “I call out your name, my love” “Oh my love” "The world is nothing” “And I am bewildered” “Do you know that this is love?” “Why is it like this?” “Why is it like this?” “My heart is hassled by you” “Making it alone” “There’s a lot of space in my heart for you” “It is your mistake if you deny to stay” “I sent out my invitation for you” “You don’t come to me” “You are filled in my thoughts” “There won’t any separation until my last breathe” “You never agree with that” “You with me” “You don’t react to my adoring gazes” “You might be in distraction” “There’s this dream of mine” “I express it to you” “I am scared that you wouldn’t reach me” “Why is it like this?” “Why is it like this?” “Why is it like this?” “I sent my love through the breeze” “I became the beat of your heart” “Haven’t you heard that you don't see me?” “Like a sweet greeting” “Traces of my love are left in the clouds” “Those rain drops up above the sky” “You don't let them shower on you” “Happily… Time passes by and even if my heart stops” “I expect your companionship” “Shall I introduce you?” “The one I treasured in my heart” “Will you witness him right here now? “I'm in Love” “I'm in love” “I'm in love with you” So... You are in love with me. Is that it? Ya. Maya… Maya... See... All this is very special to me. Especially, from a girl like you makes it even more special. But, this won’t work out. Why will it not work out? I love you. So, if you love me… It should work out, right? But, I am in love with Chaitra. That is why I did all this. She cannot do this. Hey! Of course, she can’t. So, I am better, right? Delete that program called Chaitra. See... That’s the difference between you and us, Maya. There is a program behind everything you do. But, in more than half of the things that humans do, there isn't even any logic. Yeah. Humans are stupid, right? Very much! But, you are different, Maya. You can be greater or lesser than humans. But you... can never be the same. Am I greater or lesser? You are greater than all of us. You are great for all of us. Oh. Am I greater than Chaitra? Shall we change the topic? Please. No. I am not convinced. Why should we change? What should I say? How else should I explain you? We are different. Can’t you understand that? Your have wires passing through your body. And we have nerves. There is electricity flowing inside your body Whereas blood flows inside us. There is birth and death for us. You will continue to stay alive as long as your battery is charged. To make it more clearer, there is not much difference between this phone and you. Oh dang it! Maya. I am sorry. Okay, Vicky. I am just a machine. But, you know what? I didn't ask for any of this. …like creating me... giving me feelings and all that. You did it. Humans! You all are always like this, right. You think you're smart and arrogant, that you can do anything. You simply say sorry when you make a mistake and walk away. I wish I felt pain, Vicky. I don’t even understand how to react now. Maya. Damn my life! Why did a robot love me? Why do I get scolded when I reject? Damn! Are you happy, bro? Professor… I will find your daughter… I will get my project. And my robot will kill your daughter! It sounds poetic. Hey, Maya! Are you reading a book? Which book? Maya! Why should you do this? Are you still angry? I had to calm down. Unlike you, my emotions are in my control. That’s the difference between you and me. - See, Maya! What I tried is… - One of the differences! I understand, Vicky. I don’t have birth, death, childhood and many things like you. I don’t understand few things. Some are even impossible to ever happen. You have your own world. Experiments to protect people like me. Like me. I don't have a world like you. I have to be with you in your world. But, I cannot be one among you. Is it fair? Are you expecting an answer from me? I really don’t know how to react in such serious situations. But... I’ll tell you one thing. Humans don’t try to protect this world but are always trying to make it better. To make it better! It keeps changing and growing. You never know. The day might not be too far when you might become one with us. I don’t know if and when I would mingle with humans. But, you and Chaitra must be together. Really? And I have to do it. What? Yes! Ready…Ready! Come…Fast… Hey! When did you come? What happened? See. Oh! That? Simple! She became close to us. We started considering her as a family member. That’s how they do in America. Is she our family member? You didn’t tell that to me, mom. Your family is weird. You all are the same. You guys deserve each other. Kumari… What happened? I mean, Maya moved from here to there. Do you call that moving? I mean, she flew... Oh! But how? Meet Maya! Advanced Humanoid Robot! ROBOT?!?!?! Hmm. She does everything faster. I thought probably because she came from America. By the way, what else can she do? [VICKY & MAYA]: Most of the things that a human can do! [VICKY & MAYA]: Can even do anything that a human can’t do if you simply write a program for that. - What about Biryani? - Wait. You will not understand even if I say more. Now that we know she’s a robot... Let's use her. Extremely! Huh! You learnt it!! Say it properly! Hey! Why did you upload this video? This video? Just a series of unfortunate events! Looks like I need to smack you down to get some answers. I felt left out, man. What? I felt left out I said. Hey, idiot! Swear on our Xbox and tell me something. Did you have any friends ever since you were a kid? Tell me. Whoever came into your life... Their lives would be screwed up. I came into your life at that time. I took many risks for you. Now, you started seeing her and stopped playing video games with me. - We also stopped betting together. - What is he saying? So I wanted to remind you of your loneliness. At that point of time... He came into my life like a ray of hope. The great man... My alter ego... One video and 3 conversations... Two here and one over there. Finish! Hey! I heard that your story went viral on Instagram. Yeah, man. I heard it's trending. 100k likes and 200k followers! Isn’t it crazy? How can you be so shameless? 100k likes! That means you became a fool in front of so many people. Hey! You story isn’t trending but you are getting trolled. I might lose my image if I hang out with you. Listen. It's good to be trending online, right? - So many people saw and appreciated… - Wait, man. Srujana! Did you eat? You *****! Pssst! Not you... Her. 100k likes and 200k followers! The world enjoys watching people make fools out of themselves. What a bloody sadistic world. Psst! What are you talking about? I am talking about Vicky’s video. He must be shattered. Oh no. That didn't even occur to me. I did not upload that video. But… It's okay. I just told you what I feel. Pardon me if I'm wrong. If you think it's senseless... Uppal Balu! Hey, idiot! I heard your video isn’t available online anymore. Yes, she deleted it. Why? You know I don't like all this stuff, right? Right. Every trend of today will fade someday. We get bored and look for a new video. Hey! What do you mean, man? What are you saying? You won't get it. Hello. Hello, Srujana! Did you eat? What did you get by separating us? Well... Satisfaction! Everyone's craving it, right? - Are you satisfied? - Completely! Fine. You are satisfied for doing it and we’re satisfied for slapping you. Don’t mess with us ever again. Oh, yeah? You both got what you wanted. What is in it for me? Hey! What do you want? You are happy to be together again. Can I.... [MUMBLING] Tell me what you want exactly. Try to understand. Oh God! Karun! She is… Vicky! He's being fair. Let him try. Okay. Do whatever the hell you want. Yes. Shall I ride? Err... Can I hold you or touch you? Oh! You have to. Oh my! Hello, my old friends! How are you? We are away from you. So we're obviously doing well. Boring lives! Quit the nonsense and tell us why you called us. I called you here to ask you to arrange the money. Why is he asking for a loan before clearing past debts? Not loan, you fools! Fees! What for? For creating the world’s greatest, deadliest creation! My baby! That’s my baby! Is that what I'm thinking? You're right! I couldn’t get hold of it back then. Now I finally found it. I will not let it go. You cheated us once. How can we be sure you won’t cheat again? Go to hell if you don’t trust me. I will find someone else. If not Russia... I'll go with America! When will you hand it over to us? I should get my hands on it. I should give it my master touch. Then, it is all yours. How can we trust you with it? You already asked me too many questions so far. Stay if you like this deal. Otherwise, get lost. America’s waiting! Tik-Tok… Okay, go ahead. If you cheat us again... You will end up like him, you bastard! Nice idea! Do you have one more? America! Tik-Tok-Tik-Tok... Professor has hidden something. What happened to the real Maya? Who sent Dada? Damn! So many questions! We are missing something. By the way, where were you configured? At home. In the secret lab! Secret lab?! Can you take us there? Sure. Is this it? Huh? - Let’s go… - Let’s go fast. You stay here. There are goons inside. No one will give selfies. We both will go. Let’s go. There's four of them. What do we do now? Wow! You hit them pretty hard! Secret lab?! Why didn't I know about it? I don’t know what to search for. I can’t find any clue. Check over there. All we need is one small clue. Let me know if you can remember anything. Oh!!! Vicky! Is that you? It must be. All the answers for your questions are in my past. They lie in my story. Do you want to hear that? 25 years ago, a man came to me with a project idea. I've already heard about him... Some of his projects were banned And he was eccentric. And he was called the MAD scientist. But none of that mattered to me. And the project was called 'Project...' 'Project Butterfly!' For the first time in human history… An advanced... Humanoid… Robot! A deadly weapon in human form! Biggest breakthrough in the world of artificial intelligence. It's designed for military. It thinks like a human does. It behaves like a human would. And kills like a monster. Two people with a common dream... And the outcome was pure madness. In the process of making a human like machine… We left behind all our emotions and responsibilities. And even before I knew it. I started working like a machine. Mom... Hmm When will dad come home? Soon, my dear. He is busy with work. He will come soon. You go to sleep. Wake me up when dad is home. Sure. But it didn't feel like a mistake back then. Because our efforts were sincere. The result was a miracle. Human contempt on creation! Time passed by. Our sacrifice didn’t go to waste. A miracle far beyond human imagination began to take shape like a human. But the world wasn’t ready for such a miracle. They could only see the destruction it could cause. Our project was banned. It was shelved before further consideration. It was a 25 year old dream. 10 years of hard work. Everything is lost. Nothing is lost. This is not the end. Why should we stop just because they asked us to? What can we do about it? What can we do to change that? I will not stay calm like you. No. Go away! Go enjoy your family time. Go! I thought he must have said that in anger. So I didn’t take him seriously. I decided to leave that place along with my family. I went to the lab to tell him. There, I saw him making a deal with Russian corporates. Oh no! What happened? Professor Acharya, it is accidental. I didn't kill her on purpose. Tell him, Professor Acharya! “Time flow keeps increasing” “Life’s journey keeps decreasing” “For the people who open up their hearts” “Eras become instants” “For the people who doesn’t feel the essence of love” “Instants become eras” “Time flow keeps increasing” “Life’s journey keeps decreasing” Mom. “Arbitrating anger” “Disregarding mother” “Comforting like an indigenous rhythm” “Showing the way… With father’s love” “Expressing extreme love towards you” “Sometimes, there are heavy breezes” “Pouting and Grouching” “A lifelong smiles” “Music of joy and sweetness of love” “Like a bonding of blessed relation” “Like a book of tones” “Time flow keeps increasing” “Life’s journey keeps decreasing” if I hadn't signed the document that day... My daughter might have felt bad about it. But at least, she would’ve been alive. My daughter who went there to study, died in an accident. Her death was making me feel guilty. Memories that don’t fade! Moments that got wasted! Many incomplete conversations! How can I make it right? Helplessness. Does a man have to surrender to death? No! Not this time! The project that separated me from my family… …is now the solution for me. We heard about creating a life from soil. We know about the herb ‘Sanjeevini’ that can fight death. I thought to myself, 'Why can't I do that?' So I did it. Maya! She is born again. My daughter is back to life again. I defeated death but couldn’t escape revenge. It came back to haunt me. I would've let it go if it was just project to me. But Maya... is my life. He will transform it into something dangerous if he finds it. I don’t know whether you will protect it with all your might. Or take a few lives if you must. But remember one thing. Maya! She is not just a machine. She's my love. I feel it. The pain! I can feel it. I understand its value. I understand its strength. Where are you going? I can also sense revenge along with the pain. I have to take revenge. What are you planning to do? I am going to kill him. Kill him?! Welcome! Mouse is stuck in the trap! Cat finishes the meal! Sorry. I am very sorry. I think I disturbed a real nice moment. But what a story! Huh? He told the entire story in just 5 minutes. I swear on my dad, I will kill you in under 5 minutes. Dad? He must have created a girly machine. No. Prof. Acharya! Humans don’t have any feelings in this world. Why should machines do? And you! Who are you calling dad? Huh? It was my idea. It was my formula. It was my project. You are my baby. Stupid machine! I am not just a machine! You are a machine. I am the scientist. Because I can stop you! Prof. Acharya! Tell her. That she is a machine. Vicky! Are you all right? - Maya. Where is Maya? Maya! Vicky… Calm down, Vicky. I should blame the Professor. How could he leave her with me? Vicky…Listen. Let’s do something... Don’t worry. Calm down, Vicky. I couldn’t even get you back without her help. How can I possibly save her? Vicky! Listen. Listen to me. See. Maya came into your life just a few weeks ago. But, you’ve been fighting your bad luck for the last 25 years. What changed now? We might be flooded with problems. But there's a ray of hope somewhere. You just have to be brave enough to recognize it. And I saw that in you quite a few times, Vicky. You are right. Maya is not my luck but my courage. Bad luck might put us in pretty bad situations. But it is in our capability to change it. Our fear is our bad luck. Our courage is our future. Whoa!! Are you okay? This is very common in life. “Bang this …this is life” “What’s life - am all surprised” “Keeps me head on my heels” “I scream…..” “One more time give me that beat” “ Gve me that beat just give some heat” “Fire in me you can’t kill” “ You can’t kill am a raring prince” “Am a raring prince am a lot of thing” “There's Providence There's Providence” “Am gonna make u dance” “Am gonna make u dance” “ You can’t stop me a lot of things” “Am not lucky - am evident!” Bombhatttt.... Really? Cooking? Dance? No! Delete! A strong person doesn’t need to be lucky. Luck serves no good for a weak person. Luck favors only the brave! Come on… Coding started. I don’t know if I can find Maya. But I can die for her and kill someone if I must. Prepare your weapons. Almost done. Maya! Quick! Stop! Quick. Quick. Quick. It’s done! It’s complete. Here is my baby. Hey, old man! Why so much envy and hatred? This is what I got from the world. This is exactly what it has taught me. It demeaned me for being different. Made fun of me when I was just being myself. I didn't like that at all. I didn’t. Now see. That’s my baby. My baby! Come... Kill him. My baby has come! She will take care of you. Baby! Have you finished? Kill him! I did everything right. Why did she smack me? You forgot to erase my memory. You stupid human! Your thoughts might be great. But your intention is evil. That is why you could never finish anything. Bro. Tell her that you love her. No, brother. She is too wild. My body cannot handle it. She deserves better. Bro! Learned your lesson? Don’t try to mess with us. This will be your fate if you mess with us. Hey! If you want to kill me, make it quick. None of you will be alive once she's here. Who's going to come? Maya! Finish!
