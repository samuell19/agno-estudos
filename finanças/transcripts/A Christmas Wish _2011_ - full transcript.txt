Yes, I know, baby bear. Come on, we're gonna get in the car and get in our princess seat. But he might be coming back. He's not coming back, Miles. You read the note. And even if he did, we're not gonna be here. Where are we going? As far as Jack'll take us. Why do you call the car "Jack"? 'Cause it rhymes with Cadillac. Come on, get in the car, put on your seat belts. Let's go. You ready to go on a trip, Lilee? Which way are we going? North. How far north? The North Pole? No, not that far north. It looks like no job here, either. Hello ! All right, put your seat belts on. And then Santa came and the family had the best Christmas ever. Tell us another one. Oh, tomorrow, honey, I don't want to use 'em all up today. I miss home. Well, we'll find a better one. We never should have left. No, we shouldn't have stayed as long as we did. Mama, I gotta go. It'll be okay, Mama. How do you know? I said a prayer. A-- a lot of good that'll do. Hey, Miles, it couldn't hurt. Mama, you're strong. Thank you, sweetheart. Remember what Pastor Woolery used to say. What? "Women are like tea bags. "You never know how strong they are until you put 'em in hot water." Or how dumb. We gotta find a motel. Mama, I gotta go. Oh-oh-- why-why didn't you go when we stopped last time? 'Cause I didn't have to go then ! Okay. You do? Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay. The motel has a vacancy. I thought Dad took all the money. Well, I had some he didn't know about. Why'd he take it? 'Cause that's what lowlifes do. I mean, maybe he needed some for himself, right? Yeah, probably needed it for his lady friend. Yeah. Well, the motel's not far, so... buckle up. No pets neither. We don't have any pets. I could give you a better rate if you stayed the whole week. With Christmas and all, we don't get much traffic. Do you need any help around here? Nah, wife does it. Mama, I gotta go ! I'm coming. Trudy may be looking for a waitress to handle the graveyard. That's what I hear. Who? Trudy Willis. She owns the Model A Cafe, south end of town. Okay. Thank you. But, Mama, I gotta go ! Well, you're just gonna have to hold it. That's what I've been doing and I can't anymore ! Does she have to be by us? A diaper ! I can't afford to hire anyone right now. Please, I've tried every town between here and the state line. I've got to find something. I understand that. No, I'll work for half the wages. You don't understand. I can't afford to hire anyone. She's re-really gotta go. Okay, do you have a restroom she can use? Sure, come here. What are you drawing, Lilee? Oh, what color is it? How about I work for whatever you can afford and tips? How about that? I can only afford minimum wage and we'll see how it goes 'til Christmas. Thank you, thank you ! Oh, you won't regret it. I already do. Oh, thank you ! Hi, Lilee. Well, this probably won't last long anyway. What's that? Oh, I said I can't wait that long. I need you to start tonight. Tonight, tonight? Oh, um, all right, let me get the kids squared away then. Mac and cheese leftover from lunch. For the children. Really? Thank you. You'll need to wear this. It's not chic, but it's clean. Great, thank you. You're a good person, Mrs. Willis. Yeah, well, don't let that get around, okay? I'll see you soon. I thought you weren't hiring. I'm not. Now. Do I smell smoke? Well, where there's smoke, there's dinner. Who's gonna stay with us? Well, I think Miles is responsible enough for that now. Do I get paid, too? One thing at a time. And, Miles, I'm really counting on you. You are in the fifth grade and you're old enough. Should be in sixth. We've been through all that. I held you back so you could take better care of yourself. And not get beat up by bullies. Mel, less talk, more eat, please. Okay, I'm gonna give you the number of the cafe. If you need me, you go to the office and you use the pay phone, okay? Okay. Here you go. I love you. You got change? Yeah. No story tonight? I'll tell you two tomorrow. Come here, sweetie. Say bye-byes. Bye-bye ! I love you, oh. She might need to go to bed early. Okay, bye. Love you. Call me if you need anything. Mama trusts you. She's not my mom. She is now. No, she just married my dad, that's all. She's my mommy, too. Hey, take a picture, it'll last longer ! Martha, right? Uh, yeah. Lola. Hi. Welcome. Thank you. Oh, and don't mind them. The only thing they like looking at better than a new woman in town is a new tractor. Oh. Trudy likes all of us to wear those. Oh, yeah, all of us. Yeah, you, me, and me and you. Yeah, right. You catch on quick. That's a first around here, an actual IQ. Thank you. Where can I put my stuff? Just in back. All right, thank you. You know what we need? No, and I don't want to. A tree. It's almost Christmas. Why? There won't be any Ch-Ch-Christmas for us. Yes, there will. Have it by the door. How would we open it? Oh, yeah. By the bed? F-f-forget the stupid tree and go to sleep. It's not stupid, and you go to sleep. You're not the boss of me. I am tonight. Then you have to tell a story. I don't know any. You must know one. Oh ! Here you go. Trudy finally broke down and hired a regular, huh? Jim, you no talk like that. I didn't mean nothing by it. Well, that's me, just a broken-down regular. Don't listen to him. He's loco. Yeah, well, I've never seen anybody order enchiladas smothered in gravy. You ain't lived, darlin'. I don't know any stories, Mel. Go to sleep. Not even a Christmas story? No. All right, then I'll tell you one. It was Christmas Eve a really long time ago, so long ago that it wasn't even called Christmas yet. It's always been called Chr-Christmas. Not the first one. His name was Joe. That's what people called him. It was short for Joseph. Aye ! And she was Mary and she was going to have a baby and all the animals they passed knew who she was. Give me a break. And when Mary and Joe passed by them, the sheep would go "baaa" and the donkey went "hee-haw," and the dog, "woof." I know how animals sound. That was because the animals knew her baby was going to be very special. He was going to be the most special baby ever born. He was going to be a king, but nobody knew it yet and he was going to save people. Good people, bad people, kids, grownups-- everybody. I thought my marriage was made in heaven. Well, marriages are made in heaven, but so is thunder and lightning. True. Martha. I haven't heard an old-fashioned name like that in a while. It was my grandmother's name. It's a derivation of Mary, you know. Mother Mary at Christmastime. Maybe the mother part. So is Trudy having a hard time keeping this place open? Well, when the economy tanks, people don't eat out as much. Yeah, it's a small town, huh? Phone book has one page. Wow, what about the regulars? They keep the place going. I met the Carnes. Mm-hmm. They seem like really nice people. Oh, all our regulars are, if you don't count Les. Les? McCallum, local cattleman. Cranky? Babies are cranky, Les is miserable, like an old hamburger patty fizzing and sputtering in his own grease. Ew. Ugh. Who else should I look out for? Joe Hopkins. Oh, yeah, he's miserable, too? No, just the opposite. Hey. Okay. You probably want coffee. Hot chocolate, actually. Okay. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, can I get you anything else? Piece of lemon meringue pie. And a piece of lemon meringue pie. Coming right up. How is it? I have no idea. Can I get a fork? Oh, yeah. Fork? Mrs. Evans? Carol Ann Bullington from over at the motel. Owen's wife. Yeah, what can I do for you? There's been a little problem, kind of an accident in your room. Are the kids okay? Kids are fine. Best you come see for yourself. Um, Lola, I gotta go, something's come up. Who's gonna pay for this? What is it? What happened? What happened? I'll tell you what happened. The toilet overflowed and you ruined my carpet. Oh. It's worth probably... 100. No, it ain't. You told me you was gonna rip it out next week. Not now, Carol Ann. Are you trying to take advantage of this nice lady? Ain't happening, Owen. That boy... is not old enough to take care of 'em. Now you find someone who can, or I will throw out the lot of you ! The only thing you're gonna throw out is your belly. It's like being married to a cement mixer. Good night, Owen. Good night, Carol Ann. His bark is worse than his bite. Where am I gonna find a sitter that will work late and for cheap? I got a stepdaughter, Jeanie. She's about 16. I'll-- I'll see if she can do it. Really? Don't worry. It'll be all right. Good night, honey. Thank you. Sleep tight. How-- how does a three-year-old get all that in there? She's stronger than she looks. Didn't you put her to sleep? Yeah, she just didn't... stay there. In my office now. You, out. Miles... she was your responsibility. She's l-l-like a ninja baby. She was asleep when I-- Fell asleep? Yeah. Look, I know you were tired, but babies, they get up in the middle of the night and it's my fault for not having a crib, but... you really need to be more cautious with your little sister. She's not my sister ! Half-sister, then. If we would have stayed home and wa-wa-wa-- and waited for Dad, this would not have happened ! No, if we had stayed home, we would still be waiting. He's not coming back, Miles-- I'm sorry-- ever. I hate this ! I hate you for doing this ! You were listening? Hearing. There's a difference. None of your business. You aren't even my sisters ! Fine. Be that way. It'll be okay, Mama. Oh. You should be in bed, sweetie. God won't forget us at Christmas. No, no. Not you. But I think he wrote me off a long time ago. No, he doesn't work like that. God kinda makes you worry a while, until you get some faith, and then later, you believe in Him. See? Only you gotta pray, though. Oh. I don't think I'm very good at that, either. That's the easy part. You don't have to be, you just have to do it. How did you get so smart? Always have been. You'll see. This will be the best Christmas ever. I love you. I love you, too, baby girl. Can't we w-wait 'til after Christmas? No, because I want you to get to know your teachers before the term starts. And the kids. Yeah. That's what worries me. Look, Miles. This is a chance for you to start over. It doesn't have to be like it was before, okay? They'll make fun of me. The way I look, the way I talk. Look. You need to stand up for yourself. You need to be proud of who you are. When you show them that... they'll respect you. They'd respect me more if I was a karate master. But you're not. You are you. And you are someone worth knowing. Just show them that. Whatever. Promise? It won't do any good. Then again, it might. Let's go. First and last? How much is that? Is it furnished, by any chance? Would you consider any less? Okay. That's out. Would you consider any less? That's okay, all right. That's out. Yes, I'm calling about the house that you have for rent. Three children and one adult. No, no pets. That's out. Well, we just moved here and we're not settled, so... Okay. Oh, man. Okay. Do you want something to eat, baby? Here, come here. Let's hug. You go to sleep. Oh, my gosh, Lilee. Oh, my gosh ! You are a ninja baby. Oh, what a mess. Heard you had some trouble last night. Oh, hi. I did, but, um, everything's okay. Glad-- glad to hear it. Are you always on duty? No, I just started a shift. It's the afternoon. I'm sorry, it sounds like I was grilling you. Were you? No, I mean, I just... Just met you at 3:00 a.m. and now I'm seeing you again, and so it just seems like... I don't know, like you're always working. Not always. I'm sure your wife wouldn't like that anyway. Yeah, no, she wouldn't. If I had one. Oh. That's life. I guess it's not always like the brochure, right? No, no. Um, are you gonna stay here? At the motel? I hope not. I'm sort of hoping to find a house that I could afford, but it doesn't look like that's gonna happen. There's not a lot out there. Did you talk to Don Meyer? Who? Oh, he's the local property manager. I'm sure he can find something in your price range. You mean no price range? I'm sure he can find something. He's got special help, you know? No. Right. He's-- he's the local pastor as well. Oh, well. Doubt he'd like to help a heathen like me. I haven't been to church since I was ten. Gotta help heathens once in a while or he wouldn't have a congregation. Yeah. I can ask him to drop by the cafe if you want. I would appreciate that, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Um, it's-- Martha. Right. Evans. Now we're formally introduced. Yes, we are. I guess today's my lucky day. Thanks to you, everything's coming my way. You know, in my line of work, if it's going your direction, you're in the wrong lane. That's true. Yeah, that's a really bad cop joke. Um, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go. Thanks. Same here. Wouldn't mind getting a ticket from him. Hey ! See you tomorrow. Bye ! Oh ! How was your first day? Good ! I did the best in spelling today. Teacher said I was a good condition to the class. "Addition," you're a good addition to the class. That's great. All right, how about you, Miles? How were you today? It's school. Right, of course. What was I thinking? Listen, I owe you a big apology. For what? For coming down so hard on you when you were watching Lilee. See, today she managed to spread peanut butter and jelly all over the room while I was sleeping. Forgiven? How about even? That works for me. Thank you. Oh... Oh. Oh, why'd you let me sleep so long? You were tired. Oh, that's no excuse. I've used it before. Oh, I gotta get some dinner going. Pizza? No, I can't afford that right now, honey. Ta-da, ramen. Again? Well, as soon as I get paid, I promise, I'll get us some real groceries? Why? We don't even have a fridge. Well, I'm working on that. How about... tree? Mama, we do need a tree. Yeah, well, I'm sure wherever we're going, there'll be lots of trees in the yard. No, a Christmas tree. Here? Yeah. No, I... I can't afford a Christmas tree and we don't even have anything to put on it anyway, and I'm sure Bullington would have a cow if we brought a tree in here. A cow would take more room than a tree. You do need a cow. Uh, no on the tree. How about-- how about the star? Hi. Hi, I'm Jeanie. Yes, Jeanie, come on in. Mel, come here, Jeanie's here. I want you to meet her. Hi, I'm Mary Ellen, but you can call me Mel. Okay. Mrs. Evans? Mm-hmm. Oh, it's Martha, actually. Oh, um, Martha. My dad wanted me to ask you about the money. Right. Of course, the money. Um, right, straight to business, that's smart. See, I've only just started at the cafe, so... Heard you're working at the Root Beer. The-- Trudy's Model A, right? Same thing. Used to be called The Root Beer Drive-In. Had the best homemade root beer anywhere. Oh. Well... I can only pay you $2 an hour and I know that's under minimum wage um... and they don't pay me for another week, so I can give you half of it in advance and then the other half when they pay me. Is that okay? Just one week? Well, then I gotta pay your dad the rent and then I gotta get the groceries. I didn't have too much money when we got here. $207, 'cause Daddy took the rest. Zip it, Mel. $8 is just fine, Mrs.-- Martha. Really? Oh, thank you, thank you so much. I really appreciate that, thank you. So what grade are you in? A sophomore. Getting my license in a month. Oh. Can you drive a stick? I can. Not quite yet. My dad taught me. Well, maybe you can teach me. Seriously? Yeah, out in the parking lot. Well, if my dad says it's okay. Sure. Uh, I'll have to take that under advisement. Now here's someone you haven't met. This is Lilee. Come on, sweetheart. This is our Lilee. She's three and she's full of it. Full of what? It's just an expression, sweetheart. I know what she's full of. So why don't I get my dos and don'ts for this crew together and you can come back maybe around 10:30. Mom says it'll be a good time for me to do my homework. Oh, yeah, well, good luck with that. It can get a little crazy around here. Well, better go, but see you later. All right, thank you so much. Woo, okay. She's nice, huh? She's a lifesaver. Side of gravy's coming up. Need more butter. You want some heart medicine to go with that cholesterol? Got plenty on the truck. You ought to take better care of yourself, Frank. I figured maybe I could find somebody to do it for me. Got somebody in mind? Might be. Someone as pretty as you. There's always one more imbecile than you counted on. Sorry. You're late. I know, I'm sorry. I had to get my sitter squared away. So... here we go. Mm-hmm. Here's the deal. This guy behind me, that's Les McCallum, he's a regular and he's having what he always has, a third of a pound of ground round, French fries, onions and gravy. Fries and gravy? Heart attack special. Listen, we just give 'em what they want. Okay. The guy over in the corner, that's Don Meyer and you'll be seeing him a lot around here. Slow night, huh? Dead night. I got this. Well, it looks like you've done this before. A time or two. How are the kids? They're managing. Good. And Christmas? I'm working on that. Well, I put a tip jar out here on the counter. Everyone'll see it. I don't know if they'll do anything about it, but they'll see it. Okay. Let's see. All right. Hi. Most of the zoo will be in tonight. Oh, well, that should be interesting. So... tell me about yourself. None of my business, but if you wanted to share, we've got all night. Oh, well. I've been married twice. First one lasted long enough for me to have a daughter and then for my 30th birthday, I got a new husband and a year later, a baby. You don't waste any time, do you? I wish I had. He's the original bad boy with a truckload of friends to match. Handsome? As sin. Cowboy Cal Evans. Didn't know much about the sin part then, though. He could take over a room just by walking into it, you know? And then last week, he took almost everything that wasn't nailed down and emptied the bank accounts and ran off with the local beauty school graduate. So when did things go bad? You're funny. You're so funny. You have homework? Did-- did it. You did not. Mind your own business ! Bed in 20 minutes. You, go brush your teeth. I knew this would happen. What? You figured no rules? Wrong. Why are you doing this? You ain't making squat. I like your mom. She's not my mom. Well, Carol Ann's not my biological mom either, but she loves me. Lucky you. What have you got to complain about? She's taking care of you, isn't she? 'Cause she has to. No, she doesn't. She could have dumped you off at the state. Where's your dad? He left last week. Two weeks before Christmas? So? Seems pretty cold to leave your family at Christmastime. He'll find me. Martha didn't leave you, though, did she? Might wanna think about that. Will you tell us a Christmas story? Yeah. Did you brush your teeth? Yes. Yeah, last Tuesday. Okay, all right. You two in bed. So can I get you anything else? Coffee, tea, pie? The cherries are fresh, cherry pie? No, I'm trying to cut back. Oh. It's Martha, right? Uh, yeah. Joe Hopkins told you? Yeah, this afternoon. He says you're looking for a rental. Yes. Do you have anything that you think someone like me can afford? Yeah, I think I might have one possibility. I won't know until I talk to the owner, so why don't you give me a call and we'll see. Thanks, Pastor. Now, listen, you and the children are more than welcome to join us at church. Oh, I don't know. I don't know if your church would still be standing if I stepped in. A real sinner, huh? Just a slow learner. Well, listen, we're all a little slow around here, so you'll fit right in. But it was a very special Christmas tree. "A magical tree," some said. The only one of its kind. A special tree that bloomed for the first time when Mary's child was born. That's the kind of tree we need. But it wasn't like any other tree. This tree only bloomed on Christmas Day and the second Christmas Day was over, it disappeared for a whole other year. It doesn't sound like any Chr-Chr-Christmas tree I've ever seen. That's because it's in Bethlehem. They have different trees there. A Christmas tree is a Christmas tree. I liked your story, Jeanie. Thank you, Mel. Now you little ones go to sleep. A-a-another day at school. Yep. Not again ! Go in. All right. Hi. Hi. Got a minute? Actually, I was gonna call you. Oh, it's no problem, it was on my way. Listen, I talked to Clarice Miller. She said that she'd consider renting it out for six months. Really? How much? 500. I can't afford that. I figured that. So, if you're interested, she'll let you clean her house once a week and take off 150 a month. 350? I know it's difficult for you living by yourself and having three kids. No, what's difficult is living on my own with three kids in a motel room. Tell her I can't pay her 'til after Christmas. I told her. She'll hold it for you through the first week of January. Oh, you thought of everything. I'll let her know. Thank you. You're welcome. ♪ Hark the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪ ♪ Peace on earth and mercy mild ♪ ♪ God and sinners reconciled ♪ I want my burgers medium-well. I hate soggy burgers.

They're okay. It's... Miles is struggling a bit. His only biological parent left him. Oh, he's not yours? He is now. Well, there's only one thing you can do. What's that? Love him.

Now I sound like Mel. She's our little believer. She's absolutely convinced that... Jesus is gonna make everything okay because Christmas is here. Ah, the faith of a child. I don't really have much Christmas spirit myself. Why's that? My husband died at Christmas. Oh. I'm sorry. He was the love of my life. We were married 43 years and we hardly spent a day apart. He was always underfoot, you know, like a kid and then one day, he just up and dies on me at Christmas Eve. I'm sure he didn't want to. Well, I mean to ask him about that... when I see him up there. Do you believe in up there? I suppose. I'm still pretty upset with God for taking him from me. Maybe you can tell him that when you see him. I should have sold this place a long time ago, but it's the only thing I have left of Sam. We did really well for a while. Sam made the best root beer. I wanna show you something. Come on. It's been ten years. Since you've been in here? No. Since Sam's last batch of root beer. I really don't know why I've kept it all so long. Maybe you're keeping it to possibly make another batch. No, Sam made the root beer. Well, with Sam gone, there just doesn't seem much of a point, no matter what Reverend Meyer says. Oh, you know what? He-- he said he might have a place for us to rent. Where? Um, the Miller house? Clarice Miller? The Brazilian buzz saw? I haven't met her. She is like one of those fish that live in the Amazon River, you know, the one with teeth and they-- Oh, a piranha? That's her. All teeth and all mouth and the only thing she cares about is herself and money. Oh. How much? 350, but I have to clean for it. Get it in writing. What are those there? Oh, well, that's some junk I was gonna get rid of. Can I have it? It's junk. How about these? Go ahead. Thank you. Hey, how'd it go? Well, we're getting used to each other. Okay, good. Here, I made a few extra tips than usual last night and here you go. What's this? My I.O.U., signed and dated. You didn't need to do that. I trust you. Well, it's not a matter of trust, it's a matter of integrity. I'm just so grateful that you're helping me out on your nights off. Well, it's helping me too, you know? I'm getting homework done, not spending as much money as I used to. Great. Okay, good. I just wanted to let you know, I didn't know about it until it was too late. What? Well, I fell asleep around midnight, and when I woke up this morning to feed the baby, it was already there. But I gotta go ! Bye ! It was there? It kinda grows on you, huh? I still need some more colors. Why, Mel? Isn't Christmas without a tree. But we don't own this room. We're gonna be here for Christmas. Isn't it wonderful? You have to erase it. A permanent marker. Where did you get colored markers? School. I just borrowed 'em. You said we can't afford a real one. Besides, I think this is better. Don't you? Permanent markers. Are you gonna take us to school? We're gonna have to talk about this later, Mel. You can help, if you want. Get in the car. I-- I'm not going anywhere. Did you see his lip? He uses your makeup to cover it. Shut up, Mel. Oh, Miles, we're going to the principal. I'm-- I'm not ratting. It's not ratting when somebody beats you up. One punch isn't getting beat up. Why didn't you tell me? They called me a stuttering four-eyes and that isn't gonna change. We'll talk about this on the way. Come on. No. Miles, get in the car now ! We-we're not going anywhere. Why is that? Oh, no. Mama, what is it? Oil pan, looks like. Is that expensive? Could be a couple hundred. Dollars? I don't have a couple hundred dollars. I could have it towed. Where? I can't afford that either. Well, you can't leave it here. There's something else that we should talk about. What? I got a call from the state today. There's a construction crew coming in. I'm gonna need all my rooms. All of them? Yeah, the state pays full rate a month in advance. I can't pass that up. Sorry. You're kicking us out the day after Christmas? Ehh... Relocating. Get the car moved. Watch stop? I'm sorry, I had car trouble. Here you go. Thanks. Oh. I know, I'm sorry, but I gotta pay taxes. What can you do? Thank you, I'm grateful. I do want you to stay after your shift today and help Lola. We're gonna do a deep clean of the kitchen, countertops, everything. Sure. But it's overtime. Oh, great, okay. Did she tell you? Yeah. Ooh, you look a little rough and we haven't even started yet. Car trouble. Tried to overhaul it yourself? I wish. Ready for the annual cleanup? I guess. Order's up. Les' hamburger. He really likes his burger, doesn't he? He is a hamburger. Like meat loaf. With hair. Ew. That's pretty nasty. Uh-huh. There you go. Is it cooked okay? That's not medium-well. Well, I can take it back. No... So how you liking it around here? Um... fine. Oh. Is that all? Well, I haven't had time to explore. Kids liking it? Well, my daughter does, but my-- my boy, he's having some trouble. Pushing him around a little? Yeah, something like that. How come? Well, he's a little small for his age and he wears glasses and... Stutters, huh? Yeah, how did you know? Probably that Park kid. My grandson had the same problem. But I straightened him out. Bring your boy around here sometime. I'll help him. Well, I don't want him fighting. Oh, he won't be. I think I saw your car parked up the interstate turnoff there. Um, are you sure it was mine? Well, there are not too many old blue caddies around here. I had some car trouble. You ought to move it. I-- I can't right now. I can't afford to. Ahh. Well, that's your choice. Get back to my... burger. Hey, guys, that's looking pretty good. It's from your story. No. This one's better than my tree. How do you know? Because it was my story. What happened to your eye? I ran into something. Yeah, Danny Park's fist. Is he bothering you? No, but I seem to be bothering him. You should tell your mom. At least someone cares. What are you drawing? The couch. Oh, hi. What can I get you? Does Lola have any of that chili? I'll see. Have it up in a jiffy ! She is better than my dashboard radar. And louder. You know, when I was a kid, The Root Beer was the place to hang out. Yeah, Friday, Saturday night, you couldn't even find a parking spot. Really? Yeah. Really great carhop stand. Oh, I always wanted to do that. Carhops? Yeah. I'm too old now, though. Not from where I'm sitting. It was-- it was a magical place. Yeah, how so? Well, if-- if you needed help in something or you wanted to meet that special somebody, you just came to The Root Beer and made a wish and it would come true. Oh. Mel would love that story. Mel? My daughter. Mary Ellen, short for Mary Ellen. But she loves stories with magical stuff in it. Um, so did you ever make a wish? Yeah, yeah, once. Well, and... She didn't work out. Oh. Well, being single's not so bad. I'm not single, I'm romantically challenged. That's funny. You have a great laugh. Thank you. Just my laugh? The rest isn't bad either. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean-- No, no, no, no. I mean, we both have baggage, right? Yeah, I guess so. Here you go, tall, dark and available. Thank you, Lola. Oh, are you okay? It's hot. Oh, I'm sorry, have some of that. Thank you. I'm so sorry. It's good, it's-- it's good. Hey, do you wanna go see a movie sometime or get some dinner? With you? Yeah, yeah, that's the general idea. I don't-- no, that was-- that was dumb. I don't know why I was-- Yeah, no, thank you. Have a good night. Oh, Martha. Oh, you are so stupid. "With you?" Oh, you're so stupid. Uh-huh. I don't need your help. He's a stud ! I couldn't ! I thought you said he ran off with a beautician ! He did, but I'm not divorced. Uh, no, you're divorced, you just haven't gone to court yet. Which means I'm still married. Do you know why most women would rather have beauty than brains? Why? Because most men can see better than they can think. But Joe Hopkins is the whole package. Wall-to-wall handsome, soft-spoken-- very important-- honest to a fault and single ! And you said no. 'Cause I made a vow, Lola. So did he. Well, I'm keeping mine. Besides, I know what people think. Oh, don't worry about what people think. They don't do it very often. Hey, how come he never got married? Almost did, she left him the day before the wedding. That's awful. I don't think he's ever really gotten over it. I can imagine. He's never forgiven women or himself since. In fact, you are the first person I've seen him even take an interest in. The destitute mother of three? Yeah, go figure. Hmm. Mom, we're ready. Okay, good, I've got your lunch right here. That one's for you, that's for you. Wait, what is this? I didn't say nothing. Don't make a big deal. Oh, my gosh, how can I not make a big deal? I'll handle this. Please. I have a possible 10-87. I'm gonna need a tow on the corner of State Street and Mapleton Boulevard. Hey, Miles. What are you doing home so early? I didn't-- I didn't think it would matter this close to Christmas. Whoa, hey, that's pretty good. It's not as bad as I thought it'd be. Yeah, I know. You wanna help her? Finish the tree? It'll be our surprise. Needs something for the flowers. You know what? I think I have the right thing. How about that? Cool. Very cool. Yeah. It does feel you-- make you feel like Christmas, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. It's beautiful ! You helped? I did the crib and the baby stuff. Really? Yeah. Lilee was my model. This will be the best Christmas ever. Knock-knock. Hey, my mom sent me. Lola's sick and can't make it in and Trudy's visiting her sister in Blanding. Okay. Um, well, could you watch Mel and Lilee? Miles can help. I can? Well, can't you? Sure. Yeah, okay, come on. Look what he did. Okay. All right, come with me. Who started the coffee? I needed something to drink. Oh, thanks, Les. Listen, we need a cook. Do you know anyone? I might. As long as it's hamburgers. So you like hamburgers, huh? You got a problem with that? No. Is this the one? The one what? Uh, never mind. Les, the grill, please? Thank you. Okay, give me your coat. All right, I want you to meet 'em and greet 'em, smile and say, "Thanks for coming." Okay, where? Just wherever it's empty. Okay. Thanks, buddy. How're you guys doing tonight? You want me to come over there and flip your flapjacks for you, Frank, huh, huh? Les, I got eggs over easy, chili dog and hash browns. Hamburger, eggs, hash brown. No, no, no, I said eggs and chili dogs. I don't do chili dogs. I do hamburgers. Just because you like hamburger doesn't mean everybody likes it. They do tonight ! Don't they?! Would you like me to put it on the specials board? Well, if you want. People want their food. Boy, they can have it good or they can have it fast, not both ! His bark's worse than his bite. I'll take your word for it. Let's go. I want a steak. Thick and rare. Well, the cook said to tell you that this was better, so I wouldn't complain if I were you. But this ain't a steak. Jim, not so loud, everyone will hear you. I don't care. What about steak don't Lola understand? Well, it's not Lola. Really? You got a problem? I ordered a steak. Well, that's what you got, hammerhead. That's hamburger steak. That's the best grub on the planet. It is? If I say it is ! I, um... tried to warn you. Not hard enough. No way. I ain't eating that. Who don't like their food?! What's good? Hamburger. Then I will have the pie. Well, I really recommend the ground round. Pie is fine. I call it shepherd's pie. Nice apron. Brings out the color of my eyes, don't you think? You don't want to know what I think. Keep it that way. What gives? Well, Lola's sick so I had to improvise. So you brought in Stalin as the chef. Nice. Well, we're selling a lot of hamburger. Yeah, I'm sure you are. Um, listen, I want to... apologize for the other night. No, you don't-- you don't need to. Well, I feel like there's something I need to explain. You don't have to owe me anything. Technically, I'm still married, so... Oh. I thought... I thought when you said that... I guess it doesn't-- it doesn't really matter what I thought, does it? No, it does, just-- There's something you don't understand. You don't need to explain anything. I promise. Any more orders? I'll ask Martha. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You call your mom Martha? She's not my mom ! She looks after you, don't she? Yeah. Well, then she's your mom, treat her accordingly. Why do you care? I don't. At least about a spoiled kid like you. I'm not spoiled. Oh, yes, you are. That's why those punks pick on you. You-you don't know not-nothing about me ! I know that you have a hard time talking and you wear glasses so you think you have a tough time. Well, you don't. How do you know? 'Cause I was your age once. Yeah, wh-when there were dinosaurs. You wanna know a simple way to stop 'em? I'll take that as a yes. Come here. Now, I once knew a man, little fella, worked in a bank, and he got into some kind of trouble and they sent him to jail. Well, the minute he got there, it was just awful, 'cause the worst bully in the joint harassed this guy and he stole his food, he opened his mail. He never gave that little guy a break. What did he do? He went crazy. What do you mean? Well, that little fella got one of the guards to warn the bully and his buddies all about him. He said that little banker was a-- a psycho. He said he-- he did terrible things to people. That's why he was in jail. He said that little banker's the most dangerous man he ever saw. He said if anybody pushes him over the edge, he's gonna pay for it big time. It was-- it was just a story? Yep. Because, most of the time, what people seem like is a lot more important than what they are like. You understand? Maybe. That little man put a piece of Alka-Seltzer under his tongue, foamed up like he was foaming like a dog. And if a bully thinks that he's got a real fight on his hands, well, he's not gonna want it to continue. No, the biggest troublemaker you're ever gonna have to deal with in life is watching you from that mirror every morning. Do you understand? Yeah. Good boy. Hey, Miles? You need to get some sleep. We're not gonna have any more customers tonight. Okay. What's all this for? It's for making root beer. What's th-this for? Looks like a recipe. Maybe w-we could try it sometime. Listen, you need to get to bed. You can sleep on the couch, okay? Okay. And I want to say thank you, you were great today. Sure. All right. Any more? Oh, I think we're done. What's that boy of yours want for Christmas? He hasn't said much. I didn't ask that. I don't know, he probably wants some homemade root beer. He's a man after my own heart. Oh, Les, I-- I couldn't, no. Is your arm broke? Those kids deserve a Christmas. Les, I can't. No, no. You are the most arduous woman I've ever met in my life. Les, really-- Thank you. Now go home. Go on, I'll clean up. Oh, Trudy has a little get-together Christmas Eve. Shuts down early. Bring the kids. Thanks, I will. Oh, thanks. We did good. Hey. Thought you might want a ride. You were waiting for us? I had to impound your car. Oh. Why didn't you tell me? Would it have made a difference? I might have been able to save you a $200 impound fee. Thanks for towing me. You want a ride? No, walking's good for the soul. Ri-riding's good, too. Hop in. Just need to fill in behind it. With what? You know, Christmas stuff. We're gonna be late. Oh, hey, it's a half-day. I told you you could miss if you wanted. I changed my mind. Oh. We can finish it tonight. Okay. Well, bye. Bye. Love you, bye. Bye. Miss Lilee, what are we gonna do today? D-did you pick up what I told you? Sure did. Okay. Let's do this. Okay. Hi, I wasn't expecting you. Need to talk to you. She wants more money for the house. No, but she has decided she doesn't want to rent it now, but I'll keep looking. It's probably just a waste of your time. No, helping folks is never a waste of time. Danny, you'd better not bother him today. Is wimp boy afraid? No, psycho. Huh? I tried to talk to him but he wouldn't listen. I'll make him listen. No, you don't understand. He's dangerous. Real dangerous. I'm afraid he'll hurt someone... again. Again? Last time this happened, we had to move. Do you think we like it here? We haveto be here. What-- what do you mean? Too late. I tried to warn you. Yes ! Holy crap ! I can't believe that worked ! God helped you do that, you know. Where has he been before? Probably waiting for you to make the first move. Now come on. Oh. Mr. Bullington. May I come in? I'll come out, the baby's sleeping. Something's come up. The state workers, they're coming in tomorrow and I need your room. It's Christmas Eve. I already took an advance. Where are we gonna go? You might try over at the Sleepy Inn, over at the Mayfield. I don't have a car. I got no choice. I'm sorry. Is that what you want, Joe? What you really want? I think it's what you should want, too. Let's go to my place. I still have a few things we need to consider, okay? Yeah. Yeah, okay. It is beautiful. This is gonna be the best Christmas ever. Actually, this is our last night here. What? Where are we going to go? I haven't figured that out yet. I was hoping that we could get that house that Mr. Meyer told us about. But we can't? It's okay. I don't even have Christmas presents for you guys. What about these? That's not much. We weren't expecting anything. Oh, honey, that's so sweet. We're gonna have to paint over the tree. Why? Because it wouldn't be right to leave it here like this. But h-he's the one making us get out. Whether Mr. Bullington is right or wrong, it doesn't matter. It's what we do, that's what's important. Mel... it's your tree. We'll paint over it when you get home. The cafe closes early tonight. Do you guys wanna come with me? Yeah ! Yeah. Okay guys, come sit over here. Santa Claus. Yeah. Here, Lilee. I got you some coloring. Thank you. Here you go. Pink. You okay? I'm fine. You don't look fine. I'm just trying to iron out some of the bugs. Ah... got it. Mmm, I love this place. Yeah, it does kind of grow on you, doesn't it? I'm saving up to buy it. Seriously? I'm still a couple of grand short. Oh, well, you'll find it. I doubt that. I can't find my head with both hands. You have family here? Not here, mm-mm. So you're spending Christmas alone? Not alone. What does that mean? Well, that just means that her and Frank are an item. Rasmuss-- Rasmussen, and, yes, he has hidden qualities. Oh, he has very hidden qualities. How are you? Um, I'm fine. There's something she's not telling us. What? Nothing, it's just that Miller lady, she's not gonna rent us the house. Why am I not surprised? You're not? She was here. She was? Yeah. And she was with somebody. Who? Joe. Ugh ! That poor boy can't think for himself when she's around. Joe knows her? Oh, she's a horse's patoot. They were engaged and she broke it off. She's the one that left him at the altar? Every silicone square inch. And now they're-- Looks like it. Oh. Well, maybe they'll work it out. I doubt that. He's normal and she's a South American Looney Tune. Well, I do have to say, this has been more like old times around here than in a very long time. I think you have a lot to do with that, Martha. Me? Oh, I don't think so. No, she's right, you have made a difference. I've been here, what, ten days? Well, sometimes that's all it takes. Well, ladies, these are bonus checks. It's not much, but it's all I could afford. I don't know how to tell you this, but I can't make a go of this place. I'm gonna close it down. Um, Mama? Hi. What's going on? Well, it isn't much, but everybody pitched in. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas ! I... I don't know what to say. Well, don't say nothing. I brought the boy something. Thought you might like these, just like Sam used to make. You made it for me? Mmm... Say thank you ! He-- he-- the boy can talk. Thanks. I'll teach you how to make it. Yeah ! Thank you, Les. Thank you, thank you ! Cut that out, cut that out. Don't get sloppy on me. Merry Christmas, Martha. We love you. Sounds like old times, doesn't it, Sam? Merry Christmas, darling. Merry Christmas. And remember, everybody is welcome at the church annual Christmas breakfast in the morning. We are so glad that you came to this town ! This is incredible. Well ! Well now, isn't this nice? What you think, Bob? Yeah, real nice. Yeah. Stand back. What are you doing here? Well now, I didn't want to miss the little gathering, or my boy. Right there, Miles? I told everybody... you would come back. You, you are a hard one to track down, baby. Still look good, though. You're not. Why don't you slip into something more comfortable, like unconsciousness? Hey now, baby, no reason to get angry. I was expecting you to still be at our place. How come you left, huh? I'm not the one who left. Well, it don't matter none, 'cause I just came here to get you some stuff. Bob. Here you go. Is that all? Then you'll go? Yeah. Yeah, all of us. Here you go. How did you-- I stopped by the hotel, buddy. Picked up your stuff. You broke in? Well, the door was open, sort of. Hotel manager's right obliging, though. Ten bucks didn't hurt, neither. Let's go, buddy, come on. Don't go, Miles. I'm sorry. But we're a family ! Cal, don't do this. He needs a stable home. What are you saying, I ain't a good daddy? I'm still your daddy, right, buddy? I-- I told everybody that you-- you would come back. Let me do the talking, buddy. Let's go. Send it to the address on the paper. Let's go, Bob. Merry Christmas. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? Don't worry, honey. I'll-- I'll take the girls. Come here, sweetie. Come on, Aunt Carol's gonna take you for a walk. Thank you. Come on, come on. What about you, Mama? Just go with them, okay? I need to be alone. Bye, Mama. Come on, honey. You really need to be more cautious with your little sister. She's not my sister ! Half-sister, then. If we would have stayed home and w-w-waited-- and waited for Dad, this would not have happened ! Why didn't you tell me? Don't make a big deal. Oh, my gosh, how could I not make a big deal? I'll handle this. Please. She's not my mom. She is now. No, she just married my dad, that's all. You wanna help her? Finish the tree? It'll be our surprise. We did good. No, he doesn't work like that. God kinda makes you worry a while until you get something, then later, you believe in Him. Only you gotta pray, though. I don't think I'm very good at that, either. That's the easy part. You don't have to be. You just have to do it. God... ... I know I haven't prayed before. There isn't anything else I can do. I've done everything I can. I can't lose Miles and I'm out of options. I never asked for any handouts... and I never broke down. I did everything that I thought was right. I don't care about me. I care about Miles. I love him so much. And he doesn't deserve any of this. None of this is his fault. I... If you're gonna punish somebody, punish me. Just... please don't let him go with Cal. I'm begging you. God, if you're up there, please... Please help me. ♪ Mary's child ♪ To us he has been sent ♪ ♪ Mary's child ♪ His heart and soul are spent ♪ ♪ Child of glory ♪ Around Him angels sing ♪ ♪ Mary's child ♪ God's greatest gift he brings ♪ ♪ Mary's child ♪ God's greatest gift ♪ He brings The-- the door was locked. Did you forget something? Yeah. Okay, um... what is it? I'll get it for you. You. What? We were h-heading back and... ... and he told me not to do that. Do what? This. H-he called me a stuttering f-four-eyes. Oh, Miles. He said I always could be one if I didn't quit. Miles, I am so sorry. And then I f-figured it out. He was the one that made me feel like nothing. He called me that-- always has. And then-- and then I remembered something you said. What's that? To stand up for myself and be proud of who I am and others would be. I told him t-t-to t-t-take me back to th-the cafe. But you weren't there. How did you get here? He brought me. Cal? No, him. Thank you. I wanted to show you something. I came by the cafe, I found Miles instead. He filled me in. Sort of. What is it? Why don't you come see? We should hurry, though. It's supposed to snow. That. What's all this? It's for you. Come on. Hi ! Hi ! Hi ! Everybody pitched in. Pitched in? Yeah, this is Clarice Miller's house. Joe talked her into renting it to you. The Pastor and the congregation did most of it. That ain't all ! Frank... It wasn't as bad as it first looked. What wasn't? Jack? It's all fixed. And Leroy, over to the garage, he found out another thing. What, that Jack's a worthless piece of junk? Nope. It's a special model, only 600 of 'em ever made. Car's worth maybe 5,000. $5,000? Jack's worth $5,000? Oh, my gosh ! There's one other thing. It looks like The Root Beer Drive-In is gonna open again. Who's doing that? Me and Frank are buying it, but we're really gonna need some help. Are you interested? Are you kidding me? And something else. Go on, tell her. Sorry about earlier, you know, kicking you out and that mix-up with that fella that said he was your husband. And the rest of it. Well, I was talking to the foreman from the state and I told 'em what you were up against. And all of 'em donated! Your first month's rent, all taken care of. Yeah. And? You're very sorry. Aren't you, Owen? You don't know how sorry I am. I thought God abandoned me. No, He sends His angels, but they don't always come from the sky, some are already here. Yes, like the one who came up with this whole idea in the first place. You did all this? Not just me. No, it was all of us. And all of us... we're very happy you're here with us in Mapleton. We love you, Mama. Oh, I love you, too. I-I-I love you, too, Mom. Oh... I love you, too. That's what I call a merry Christmas. No. A root beer Christmas. Where's the church? Right down the road.
