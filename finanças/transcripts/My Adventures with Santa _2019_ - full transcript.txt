[Narrator] Christmastime, as we all know, is, without a doubt, the most wonderful time of the year. For many hundreds of years, kids, parents, grandmas and grandpas, even pets wait with bated breath for Christmas morning to arrive with all its magical splendor. [Banging] So many stories about Santa's adventures and his trusty elves have been told throughout the years, but there's one tale that has yet to be revealed. [Ticking] Have we found a new head for our stocking stuffer division? Everyone already has a job, so I'm not sure who. We need more stocking stuffers. What can we do? Are you sure this gauge is working correctly? There is no problem with it. It works just fine. It's at an all-time low. Even the elves are feeling it. - More hot cocoa? - Can't you see I'm busy? Go away. Well, then, more hot cocoa and cookies. - Double the order. - I have. I said, go away! - Uh, triple the order. - I have, Santa. - [Squeals] - Ooh! [Elves] Tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights! - Tight-ee tights! - Tight-ee tights, tight-ee tights! - Tight-ee tights! - Tight-ee tights! [Yelling] [stifled laughter] Sweet. Here you go. Ah. I put an extra pinch of cocoa and two cookies. I know it's not a cheat day, but I thought you could use it. - I was-- - La Befana's coming for the globe. Oh, pish! She comes every year to steal the globe, and just like every year, the EAF will stop her. Her power increases as the Christmas spirit declines. If it gets any lower, there'll be no stopping her. Oh, boo-hoo. Go cry about it, you big baby. You knew someday things would turn my way, and this is my year. I will finally get mine and put an end to Christmas... [chuckles] forever. [Laughs maniacally] [laughter echoes] [Josh] It's our beautiful house, kids. - [Sammy] Yay! - [Jen] We're home! [Josh] We're home. Let's do this. [Sammy] Can I help get the tree down? Can I help too? You guys can both help. The beginning of a beautiful Christmas, kids. There we go. Whoa! Dad, you all right? - [Grunting] - [Jen laughing] Aces, buddy. Just aces. [Crickets chirping] [Josh] Valerie, it's late. We're waiting for you. What do you mean? Because I can barely hear you over the music. [Christmas carols playing faintly] No, you never told me anything about a Christmas party. Oh, a surprise, huh? I'll tell you what, Val, it's just not-- No, it's not fair. [Sighs] Kids, I'll be right back. - I guess we start without him. - [Door opens, closes] - We should wait. - You can. "Jen, 2014, first year playing soccer, undefeated." You wanna hang it or not? [Josh] Well, you know that we're decorating the Christmas tree tonight, right? I still have a lot of work to do here. I have to retouch a bunch of photos. Honey, I know. I'm sorry. But I have to make this deadline. Okay, Val. I'll see you soon. [Phone beeps] - [music playing] - [sighs] Oh, there she is! Just the talented photographer I was looking for. [Chuckles] I can't. Of course you can. [Clears throat] Big news. We're gonna be shooting P&J's entire spring catalog! What? Really? Can you believe it? That's amazing! Get your retouches done, get it in on time, and I promise, the next job, six figures. Thank you. Enchanté! - [Sammy] Hey, Dad? - [Thuds] I'm sorry, bud. [Sighs] Your pop's been a little bit wacky lately. Josh, your mom and I have been working long hours. Wanna play catch? Isn't it a little bit past your bedtime? Well, I guess. All right. - Hey, bud. - Yeah? Remember those distributors we met down at Comic-Con? Yeah? I sent them the game and they seem pretty interested. - No way! - Yeah. That's so great! Fingers crossed? Fingers crossed. - I love you. - Love you too. Night, Dad. Night. [Sighs] - [car door opens] - [Valerie] Hi, honey. [Josh] Hey, Val. It's almost midnight. I know. I'm so sorry. But I have some great news. We were asked to shoot P&J's spring catalog. - "We"? - With David and I. And it's big money, Josh. Big, huh? Yeah, like six figures big, and David, he's amazing with the clients. We got six weeks in Bermuda, three weeks in Puerto Rico, tropical theme. I mean, can you believe it? No, actually, that's nine weeks. Yeah, and then we have, you know, four weeks of prep, but... Why are you looking at me like that? Are you kidding me, Val? Thirteen weeks is a long time to be away. I mean, you didn't even want a job. The only reason you got one is 'cause I lost mine. You know they decorated the tree all by themselves? [Valerie] You know what? That's not fair. [Josh] Yeah, you're right. It's not fair. [Crayon scratching] [writing] [owl hooting] [snoring] [horn blaring] Oh, dear. [Machinery whirring] [chimes] [soft buzzing] Bollowillow! Oh! [Wind whistling] [laughs] Well, these photos are horrible. No wonder everyone thinks Santa isn't real. [Chuckles] Always hiding out in the North Pole. You know, what he needs is a good publicist. My sister has a friend who has a friend who dated a guy in Los Angeles... - Oh! - ...who has a friend that's a publicist. Can you introduce me? They get to go to the best parties. Yes, with Santa clearly on his way out, I wanna make a big splash, I want the whole world to know that La Befana is taking over. - [Chuckles] - La Befana! What is it? I'm monologuing. You said to let you know when Santa is up to no good. And? He's up to no good. So let's talk diversion. What we do is be careful now. To make sure... Oh, I can't tell what he's doing. I need a spy. Go get Franklin Mint. Uh, you had him locked in the basement with the rest of us 'cause you couldn't tell us apart. Well, go get him out! The jolly fat man is obviously up to no good and I don't like the smell of it. Well, it wasn't me. Yo, who you playing with? I'll slap you upside your head. Okay, enough! Go get Franklin Mint out of the basement and send him to the North Pole. Look... Undercover. I need to know what's going on in that holly jolly noggin. ¶ We wish you A Merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A Merry Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Good tidings we bring ¶ Move it, try-hard. Whoa! [Yelling] [glass squeaking] Hey! Cut it out, bro. Or what, bro? Or I'll let my sister loose on you. And trust me, you don't want any part of that. [Scoffs] Oh, yeah? What's a girl gonna do? Touch her, I'll break your arm off. I know kung fu. Whatever, newb. Thanks, bro. Yeah. I'm bored. Let's go. ¶ We wish you A Merry Christmas ¶ [Sammy] Hey, kid, you can get off that glass now. ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Good tidings we bring ¶ - [static crackling] - The globe is out. What? The globe is out. I can't hear you. The globe is out. It's not protected! Unbelievable! That jolly whoopee cushion has lost his mind. - Quick, get back here right away. - Oh! Goon, bring me my magic dust. Show me the snow globe. There. There it is. Bring it to me. [Goon screams] [crashes] [Jen] I think Mom's really gonna like what I got her. [Sammy] Yeah, me too. What's that place? [Jen] Can we go in? Sure. It's the Christmas caboose. - Oh, cool. - [Chuckles] Cool. [Sammy] That guy looks like Santa Claus. Whoa. This place is awesome. It worked. Wow, look at that! Stay back. [Jen] Looks so old. Yeah. I wouldn't. Why not? Whoa. Whoa. I feel like I just drank hot cocoa and ate cookies. What? Let me try. Whoa, chocolate chip cookies! [Rattling] [wind whooshing] Did you hear that? I don't know. Whoa. [Clanking, whirring] [dings] What does it say? I don't get it. "Take this snow globe, but don't let anyone know. Santa needs your help, so be prepared to meet the Christmas foe"? That doesn't make any sense. I think we should take it like it says. That'd be stealing. It told us to. [Sighs] Fine. But whatever you do, hold on to that paper, if anyone asks. Put it in my backpack. [Wind whooshing] Okay. Let's go. [Electricity crackling] [crashes] Franklin, your butt needs a mint! Oh, hey, chitlins. Where you guys going? - You better give me that snow globe! - Chill. - [Franklin] It's mine! - [Jen screams] Let go of me! - Let go of me! - No! No! - [Sammy] Got him. - [Goon] Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em! Oh! Jellybeans, the most magical fruit. Hey, get back here! - Out of the way, out of the way! - Hey! [Elves grunting] - [elves farting] - [elves laughing] I don't think these are good elves. - No. - [Man] Hey, guys, move it. Jen, this way! [Grunting] [Goon] Let's get those kiddos! Go, go, go, go, go! [Groaning] [chuckles] Try-hard! [Grunting] [groans] Thank you for coming. Oh, it was fun. It's always good to see you. Always. [Air-kissing] Oh, hey, are you on schedule to deliver? Uh, no, actually, I'm not. - Hmm. - Why is Kate here? - Well, surprisingly enough, she's looking for a job. - Oh. The number one photographer in the business, and she's knocking on my photo studio door. Hey, Valerie, you're still my girl, okay? I really need help retouching these photos or we are not gonna make our deadline. Sorry, no can do. We overspent our budget on the Christmas party. Well, I was hoping that you would actually be able to help me. Me? No, I don't do computers. My family's having dinner with my mom tonight. I can't stay late. Reschedule. She's giving the kids their Christmas gifts. Put it this way, if you don't deliver on time, the only gift you'll get this Christmas is unemployment. [Crickets chirping] [Josh] Sammy, Jen, are you here? [Low buzzing] Kids? Hello? Kids, are you here? Kids? [Sighs] There you are. I am so sorry that I was late. There was a snowslide, and then my phone died and I was stuck. And then when I didn't see you two at the ice rink, I got so scared and I... - [Jen] Just wait. You'll see him. - [Sammy] It's not real. There! Did you see him? Did you? Kids? Hello? - It has to be a hologram. - He's real. Uh, who's real? A magic snow globe. Ah. Magic snow globe, huh? - Where'd you get it? - [Sammy] This caboose next to the rink. It snows inside the caboose. Oh, it snows inside the caboose, huh? Truth. We're not lying. Here. Take this. It told us to take it. "Take this snow globe, but don't let anyone know. Santa needs your help, so be prepared to meet the Christmas foe." We were chased by angry elves. You were chased, huh? Do you think they were real? I mean, they looked pretty real. But are Santa's elves creepy like that? No way. They had to be some sort of mutant elves. Yeah. So mutant elves, huh? Santa Claus-- [Valerie] Josh, why are you home? You're in trouble! Wish me luck. Honey, we were supposed to be at my mom's over two hours ago. [Josh] I know. There was a snowslide, my phone died, and I was stuck. What is that? It's a snow globe. No, I see that, but why is it glowing? - [Sammy] Yeah, it does that. - [Valerie] Really? Look, there's little people inside too. Oh, there's people? Aw! Let me see if I can see the people. I don't see anyone in there. Maybe if I tap on it, I'll see the people. Kids, take that thing back to where you got it from or you're both grounded. Awesome! [Laughing] Turn it off. It's scaring your father! [All screaming] [laughs] My teeth are tingling. I can feel my hair. That was awesome. So awesome! I feel... I feel great. - I know, right? - Yeah! [Bells jingling] Somebody's coming. That's, uh... That's, uh... - She's a-- - Elf. Right. I'm Bollowillow. Welcome to the North Pole. I must be dreaming. [Snorts, grunts] Looks pretty real to me. It can get quite cold here at night. We better get moving. - I'm Jen. - Hello. [Valerie] You said North Pole. Did you mean North Pole, North Pole, or did you mean North Pole Playland south of New Haven, North Pole? Mrs. Nolan, you're at the North Pole proper. [Whispers] I was afraid she was gonna say that. - Yeah, me too. - Hmm. I can assure you, you're perfectly safe. More to be explained at the village. Come on. Good enough for me. Okay, uh... All right, everybody hang on. They've got a real big kick. - Hee-yah! - [Reins snapping] [bells jingling] Where is this place? It's only moments now. Look, over there now. [Door creaking] I think you have something for me. - I do? - Check your backpack. How'd that get in there? It's magic. [Footsteps] Hello, Nolans. Oh, I'm so happy you're here. Now make yourselves at home, have some hot cocoa and snacks. Santa will be here in a jiffy. Uh, excuse me. Did you just say Santa? Oh, you can bet I did. [Chuckles] Santa as in Santa Claus? Oh, yeah, the one and only. He's my husband, always late, except on Christmas Eve. He seems to get that one right. [Slurping] This is good. But drink it slowly. It's liable to make you gassy. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Whoo! Nolans! Welcome! Welcome! Come here. Bring it in for a group hug. - [Santa laughing] - [Mrs. Claus] Group hug! - Now, Valerie, Joshua, come on, bring it in. - Come on. Group hugs all around! [Santa laughing] [nervous chuckle] Now that's what I'm talking about. A lot of love in that hug. Mmm, you smell like, um... Cinnamon Bears. I make my own soap. [Laughs] I'm happy to give you a bar if you'd like. I have several flavors. There's candy cane, pumpkin spice, Tootsie Roll. [Josh] Wait a minute. They have Tootsie Roll soap? Oh, yes, indeed. In fact, it even looks like a Tootsie Roll. Santa mistook his reindeer poop one day for a bar of soap and he mashed-- And okay, Mrs. Claus. [Santa and kids laughing] Are you really the real Santa? Have a tug. - [Gasps] - Wow! Now come with me! I wanna show you more. Come along, come along. Hey, Josh, I can't get any cell service. What? Okay, okay, I get it. Santa's real, I got it. But this, I have no idea where we're at, what we're doing here. All I know is I have a deadline and I need to go home and go to work. You did not just say that. Yeah, I did just say that. I am so sorry, because it seems that we were just sucked into a snow globe, - and now-- - I don't care! No, apparently, we're going on a tour of Santa Claus' house. It's just a really odd time to be talking about one's career. I really don't care about a tour of Santa Claus' house. I'm sorry. You know what? When I said I wanted to go away for the holidays, this isn't what I had in mind. Now, surely you can stay a little time. You've only just got here. I guess I can stay for a couple hours. [Chimes] [Santa] This way! This way! Oh, come along, come along. I want you to see! This is my workshop. [Jen] Wow! Look at them go. Man, I wish I was an elf. Is that a Christmas wish? - Yes! - [Laughs] No, human child is fine. So, they do this all year long? 364 days a year. At this pace? Oh, elves only know one speed. Oh, come now. They take lots of breaks. They work in shifts, and they're having fun. Come on, this way. Hey, hey, who's the humans? They're here to help with La Befana. Oh, come on. The elves could take 'em on anytime, anywhere. Okay? You tell Santa we don't need no help from humans. Okay, Grumpy. So it's your globe we found. It's been in my possession since 336 AD. The year that Christmas began. It was bestowed upon me by Saint Nicholas. Wait a minute. I thought you were Saint Nick. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! No, time has managed to confuse us as the same person. But Saint Nicholas wanted a holiday in which everyone took care of one another. A day not to think of yourself, but of those around you. So he took pixie dust and an old globe and created a gateway between the North Pole and the Earth. It allows me to pass through so I can deliver toys to all the good boys and girls. [Laughs] That snow globe is the greatest source of Christmas spirit. Then why is it locked up? Ah. That is a tragic story. When I first arrived at the North Pole, I discovered that it was inhabited by elves. They were surly little people with bad tempers, ruled by a queen named La Befana. [Static hums] [elf] Lunchtime! [Santa] All they ate was cold soup made from seaweed for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They'd never tried sweets, let alone chocolate. So, naturally, I gave them chocolate. [Snorts] That's delish! Give me some more, now! [Grunting] Now! [Snorting] - One more, one more! - More! More! [Santa] They loved it. So I offered to make them all the sugary sweets they could eat in exchange for their services as toy makers, - and they merrily agreed. - [Upbeat music] We built a new workshop and quarters for the elves with central heat. I couldn't have been happier. The elves embraced Christmas with all their tiny little hearts... and we had many happy years working together. However, La Befana had a tough time adjusting to all the changes, and to make matters worse, she never found a job. La Befana never found a job she was good at, and that made her jealous of the other elves. None of this is holly jolly or fun. Well, maybe if you played along, you know, pretend having fun, but not really. [Machinery clanking] "Play along." [Santa] La Befana set out to build a single toy that all boys and girls would love. She worked all day and all night for an entire month, not sleeping a wink until the day came that... Oh! [Gasping] I've done it! [Laughs maniacally] I have created a toy that all the boys and girls are going to love. And we can create enough of them for everyone in half the time, giving us a break from work. - But we like to work. - [Brumwillow] Yeah. Sort of. I guess. What do we do if we are not working? Well, you can work on something besides toys. Like what? Plum pudding. I don't know. That's not the point. [Chuckles] Here. Merry Christmas. Oh! Well, thank you. - [Bollowillow] What is it? - [Chuckles] Well... [chuckles] It's... It's a Thingy-ma-bob. And what's it do? - It's a game. - What are the rules? I don't know. I haven't gotten there yet, but it's going to be fun! That I promise. - May I see it? - Sure. [Stammers] No, that... [grunts, gasps] This is dangerous! Well, you have fat fingers. - [Laughter] - This could hurt a child. [Scoffs] As if you know. This toy is a reject. [Clatters] No! - No! - [Zapping] La Befana, enough! [Wind whooshing] You're gonna let her talk to me like that? Well, I can't deliver a toy that's not functional. Just give it to the brats and let them figure it out. [Elves gasping] What happened to your Christmas spirit? [Scoffs] Well, she took it. And he took it, and her, and him! And you! This was my kingdom, and if my toy isn't good enough, well, then no toy is good enough! - [Thunder rumbling] - [wind whooshing] Did she die? Oh, no. The snow globe banished her to a secret location. So, every year, La Befana tried to steal the globe and every year, the Elf Action League stopped her, but they were spending more and more time stopping her and not enough time making toys. And the world is such a big place, and the demand for toys is [laughs] inconceivable. So I was forced to create a magical box to save the snow globe from La Befana's magic, and only on Christmas Eve do I take it out. However, there's been an unexpected side effect. Christmas spirit has never been lower. My guess is that the globe is not only a doorway between worlds, but the prime source of Christmas spirit. And with it locked up and unable to freely spread its magic... I don't know how much longer Christmas can exist. Santa? Can we help? Yes, Sammy. - I believe you can. - How? Well, deep inside La Befana's heart is still the Christmas spirit. I need a family like yours to remind her what Christmas is all about: giving a very special gift to those who are dear to you. [La Befana] Christmas spirit? In me? [Laughs incredulously] I think that jolly red pincushion has gone mad. So that's your little game, Claus. You brought them here to defeat me. Well, good luck with that. Wait, strike that! I do not wish them luck, because they will fail. [Slurping] Would you two please stop slurping? [Burps] Sorry. [Laughs] Whoa! That was epic! - Yup! - Yup! You two had the snow globe right there in your hand and you failed miserably! - [Burps] - Stop! I'm certain those Nolans pose no threat. [Scoffs] I mean, yes, that boy is sweet and the girl does have a little gumption, but the parents, they are Santa's weakness. So... I will use them to get my globe. Yes. And then, I will deliver the world one gift, the same gift for everyone. [Exaggeratedly loud burp] Sorry. Breath mint. [Chimes] [Jen] Candy, have some candy! I know your game. What game? You're trying to take my job from me. You should wash your hands. Thirsty. - Drink it slowly. You might get ga... ssy. - [Groaning] [farts] Gross. Okay. [Farts] Okay. I'm watching you. Merry Christmas. [Bollowillow] Jen! You're the only human that I can honestly say has as much spirit as an elf. My parents call it gusto. That's gonna come in handy when fighting La Befana. She sounds scary. She is. Don't mind him. He's the leader of the EAF and takes great pride in defeating La Befana every year. Oh. She's a bully, and like all bullies, you just have to stand up for what's right and eventually, they crumble. What if you're scared? Run away and go home. Listen, if you're scared, just close your eyes and remember that you can overcome anything. Anything? It's what real elves do. Excuse me. Do you have a phone? Oh, no, we banned phones years ago. You what? We write letters. I am so fired. Don't worry, Mom. You can help me serve hot cocoa. [Wind whooshing] And this is my garage. - Whoa, look at the sleigh. - [Laughs] Don't touch, don't touch! Off limits, little child boy. I just calibrated the dyno centrifuge. Brumwillow, this is Sammy and Josh Nolan, here to help me with La Befana this year. Oh, how nice to meet you. Time is short. I need to get back to work. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that an I-11 chipset? I didn't even know that they were developed yet. Who did you think developed the prototype? No, come on! Brumwillow. Too kind, really. It's a hobby. Helps me sleep. Designing chipsets helps you sleep at night? [Santa chuckles] Oh, no, not an ACME GPS. What-- What-- That's a top-of-the-line model. - And notorious for glitches. - [Josh] Mmm. And when you update it, it gets even worse. Yeah, my dad had one. Nothing but bugs, huh, Dad? Yeah, that's right, genius son of mine. When was the last time you updated it? Two hours ago. Oh. - [Beeping] - Oh! - See? Buggy. - Buggy. [Wind whooshing] [La Befana] Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! [Water dripping] Valerie! Valerie! What are you gonna do with that brush? Clean me? [Chuckles] Uh... Well, no. I just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. I'm La Befana. I know you. You're the Queen of the Elves. I knew we would get along. So, there's rumblings that Santa is holding you hostage. Well, no, it's not like that. Don't play coy with me. We're both working girls. Very busy, no time for dilly-dallying. Men! [Scoffs] They just don't understand our needs. So, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you might wanna see this. Hello, Valerie. It's David. P&J want to see your selects by 9:00 a.m., and you're not here! If you lose this client, you are fired! Call me. [Beeps] Oh, well, that looked very important. It is. Well, there's only one way to get back home. How? You have to go out the way you came in. The snow globe? Bingo. Let me guess. You want me to bring you the globe and then you'll send me back. Oh, what a splendid idea. I love it. Nice try. I know your plan to end Christmas. Oh, I am so over that. Please, I just wanna help another compatriot in distress. I don't believe you. Well, then option number two: I make you help me. - [Thuds] - Goon! Goon, how much fairy dust did I just give her? [Goon] Uh, a tablespoon? Ugh! I said a teaspoon, you idiot! A teaspoon. - That's the small one. - [Goon burps] Sorry. Now she's gonna be sleeping all night long. Ugh! Good help is so hard to find. [Sighs] Well, sleep tight, dearie, 'cause when you wake, you'll help bring me my snow globe. Like it or not. [Laughs softly] [wind whooshing] Mom! Dad! Huh? Oh! Oh! - [Laughs] - Ow! Ow! Oh, man! [Grunts] Oh! Oh! Sammy, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. It's breakfast time. I feel like a ton of bricks just hit my head. Josh, I had the craziest dream. Well, if it's anything like we're in the North Pole with Santa Claus, news flash, it's not a dream. Oh, look. He pressed our clothes. [Sniffing] Smells like pine needles. [Groans] I'm so full, I might actually explode. That'd be awesome. - [Groaning] - Sammy, not at the table. I can't wait to find out what's for dinner. I am so sorry, but this is our last meal at the North Pole. Mommy has a job that I have to get back to and if I don't, I'm gonna lose it, so... But who's gonna help Santa defeat La Befana? Yeah, he needs our help. How can you just leave? Kids, as much as I disagree with your mother, it's time to support her. Well, thank you, [distorted] Jo-oh-oh-oh-osh. Mom? [Distorted] Is this thing on? Hello, is this thing working? Mom snapped. Pedal faster, you fool. Pedal faster! Come on, pedal faster! If I go faster, I might explode! - [La Befana] Keep going! - [Clanking, whirring] Mom? Come on! Pedal faster! [Distorted] Pedal faster, you fool! Pedal faster! [Bell dings] It's working! It's working, look! Val? Uh, Val, seriously... What's going on with you? Are you all right? Yes, I'm... I'm okay. I am so okay. You know what? We really should help the jolly fat man. I mean, Santa. Right. Yeah. And what about the old, uh, J-O-B? So we're not going home? No, honey. We may never see home again. Yes! [Chuckles] I'm so bad, it's good. [Machinery whirring] - [alarm blaring] - [automated voice] Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. Feliz Navidad. Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. Merry Christmas. There's a major malfunction! Feliz Navidad. Merry Christmas. Feliz Navidad. - Are we there yet? - Yeah, how much further? [Machinery whirring] Pedal faster or I'll turn you both into toads. Pedal! Feliz Navidad. Merry Christmas. [Horn blaring] [in normal voice] I'm back. From where? Why don't you join the kids and help them clean up? Huh? [Clanks, beeps] [whirring] [sniffs] [machinery whirring] Wha-- Wait. [Sighs] [laughing maniacally] [whirring, beeping] [whirring] [chiming] There it is. There it is. [Gasps] So close. So close. [Chiming] It's mine. Pakse, Laos, Nairobi, Kenya, and Troncones, Mexico. Quebec City, oh, Canada. Brumwillow, could you please slow down? I mean, this computer keeps glitching with a location that's not even on the map. It could be my fault. I loaded in all the Christmas deliveries before the updates. Mmm. You have a backup? Yes. I'll check. [Sighs] Oh, Santa. Little magic, this might work. I appreciate your helping me. Oh, well, computers is what I do. It's the only thing I'm good at. And what about your family? [Laughs] What? You're asking me if I'm good with my family? And I'm telling you... yes. Oh, come on. I mean, I love my kids more than anything that words could even describe. And Valerie? [Door opens] Val? Of course I love Val. The globe is missing, and so is Valerie. - Oh, dear. - Valerie. [Wind whooshing] [laughing maniacally] Just a little Christmas spirit was all you needed to defeat me. How pathetic. You're so concerned about your precious little job, you forgot about the things that really matter. Do you wanna see what David really thinks about you? Her lighting is so drab and flat. I'm surprised P&J bought this garbage. My gosh, you are so right. I nearly lost a client for this. I want you to shoot the next P&J catalog. [Kate] What about Valerie? What about Valerie? She's yesterday's news. And to make matters worse, you're gonna go down in history as the woman who brought Christmas to an end. [Laughs maniacally] Now, give me my globe. Give it to me. [Electricity crackling] No! [Thunder rumbling] Give it to me! [Both grunting] It... is... mine! [Josh] Valerie, where are you? - [Elf 1] Valerie, where are you? - [Elf 2] Valerie, where are you? - [Josh] Val, where are you? - [Elf] Where are you? - [Josh] Val! - [Elf 1] She's over here. - [Elf 2] Oh, she's over here. - [Josh] Valerie! Val! [Wind whooshing] [upbeat music] ¶ Hey, ho, ho, ho, ho ¶ ¶ Hey, ho, ho, ho, ho ¶ ¶ Hey, ho, ho, ho, ho ¶ ¶ Hey, ho, ho, ho, ho ¶ The globe is mine! [All cheering] Oh, my execution was flawless. Oh, sweet globe! I have waited for you for 700 years, and now I get my revenge, which will be not so sweet. [Laughs] And Santa will be banished and the North Pole will be mine once again! - [All cheering] - [laughing maniacally] Oh! Val? Valerie? Hey. - Hey. - What happened? You got hacked. [Valerie] I remember breakfast, but... Oh, it's so foggy right now. [Gasps] Oh, I remember David telling Kate that he was gonna fire me. But who cares about your job? Yeah, you destroyed Christmas. Hey, kids. So many other factors came to make this day come, and none of them had anything to do with you four. Oh. Well, uh, yes. Factors. No, it's her fault. All she cares about is her stupid job and so she gave up the globe and destroyed Christmas. And we can hear you guys fight, and you guys not getting along makes me sad. And now, I don't think I'll ever be happy again. Jen? [Sighs] [sniffling] Jen... Go away. I'm not talking with you. Oh, honey, I know you're sad. It's okay. You don't have to hide it. But I feel like if I don't hide it, then everyone in our family will be sad. We're not all sad. All you do is fight. I know. I'm so sorry. Your dad and I, we've been unhappy, but that doesn't mean we don't love each other. - Is it us? - Oh! Oh, baby, no, of course not. I love you guys so much. It's me. I let my anger and my jealousy get in the way of your mother's success. - Josh, please. - [Josh] No, no. Being laid off was one of the hardest things that I've ever been through, and I was so concerned with providing for my family, I didn't realize that I was taking it out on you. [Exhales] We're the Nolans, and your mother, she stepped up when we needed it the most. And, Val, I am so grateful to you. So if I need to be a stay-at-home dad for a little while... and take an obnoxiously boring job from Mark, then so be it, because... [sighs] Val, I just love you. I love you too. [All applauding] [cheering] [whooping] Kids, come give us a hug. Now, I am not gonna go down in history as the mom who ended Christmas. [Laughter] - We are gonna be the family that saved Christmas. - That's right! Yeah! [Laughs] Okay, so now, how do we get the snow globe back? Well, whatever you do, you have until midnight on Christmas Eve. Once the bells ring 12:00, La Befana controls the snow globe and banishes Santa Claus from the North Pole forever. Okay, so where's La Befana's hideout? I can address that. I'm Grumpy, leader of the EAF, Elf Action Force, and I've looked numerous times for her hideout and I've not been able to find it. Tracking dogs. How are we supposed to get tracking dogs if we can't even get home? Oh, yeah. You know, when I was working on the GPS, there was a pin drop just west of here. I thought it was a glitch, but it never went away. Uh, Brumwillow, what exactly is a pin drop? A delivery location compiled from Santa's good list. Okay. A delivery. So what if it was a delivery to someone at La Befana's hideout? It's possible, but... that means that one of them is on the good list! What! Ain't no way those surly elves are on Santa's good list. Oh, Santa, I'm so sorry they took your snow globe. I couldn't stop her. I'm a colossal failure and now the whole world is going to know. You disappoint me, old man! [Vocalizing] Never fear, Goon is here! And here's your snow globe, Mrs. Claus. With my big muscles, I have saved the day. - Now let's finish this with a kiss. - Goon! La Befana needs you-- Are you playing with dolls? Uh... Yeah. - I love dolls! - Okay! Here you go. Here's some. Okay, so, what do we know? We know that La Befana's hideout is somewhere in the North Pole. - Sammy? - Check. Right, so, what we need to do is we need to open the GPS map and check out where all the pin drops are. - Obviously. - Uh-huh. So the next clear course of action would be to-- Sammy? - Huh? - No, that's not it, Sammy. Because if we're really using our noggins and our deductive reasoning, what we need to do is-- Sammy? - What? - Exactly, genius son of mine. We need to cross-reference a real map of the North Pole with the GPS map. - [Sammy] Exactly. - I've never seen a map. I have! Long before Santa came, there was an elf who mapped the entire North Pole. No way. [Bollowillow] Grumpy, please, we need the map. I don't have it. Well, who does? That's gonna cost ya. Grumpy! Anything for you, big guy. Okay, okay, bring it in. I had an old chest. The map was in the chest. The chest is gone. Can't find it. It's lost. Well, no better off than we were to begin with. Hey, human, you don't know what it's like. Hot cocoa all the time, it gets in your head, man. Well, have you tried the lost-and-found? The what? Yeah, that's where I go at school when I lose something. Is that your lost-and-found? [Grumpy] Step back. [Clanking] Oh, gumdrops! - [Grumpy grunting] - [crashing] - Candy cane. - [Elephant trumpeting] Ah! [Glass shattering] Heads up. Heads up. Incoming. - Are you okay? - [Grumpy grunts] Yeah, no thanks to you. - I'm going in. - No, no, you're not. [Clattering] Do you need any help in there? [Metallic creaking] [clanking] [Josh] Give it to me, Sammy. 110... 347... 1,400,000. That's it. Here goes nothing. [Computer beeping] La Befana's hideout. Okay, let's go satellite mode. [Beeps] She's a crafty little elf. What's that blue thing over it? An enchantment. It's impossible to get in. You'd have to disable her security system and to do that, you'll have to gain access to the computers from the inside. Not impossible. I have a plan. Josh, zoom in to right there. - [Taps keyboard] - [beeps] Ooh, that is very small. - [Josh] Mmm. - So we send in an elf. Exactly. I'll assemble a team. Hold on. That's not gonna work. She knows all of us. The moment that she spots the EAF, she's gonna poof out of there with the globe and then all is lost. We need a surprise attack. So, someone will snatch the globe, and... Poof, the EAF swoops in for the rescue. Exactly. But who's small enough to fit down the chimney? I can go. I always wanted to be an elf, so why not just make me one? I'll go in undercover. [Josh and Valerie] Uh-uh! Why not? Please? Bollowillow says if I put my mind to it, I can do anything. Well, rum-pum-pum-pum, she's our only hope. Fine. [Mrs. Claus] All right, group hug! - Yes! - [All] Go Nolans! Okay, Dancer, it's time to go. - [Bells jingling] - [grunts] We're gonna need all the help we can get today, boy. You ready? Uh, sure. All right, let's go. ¶ Christmas time Is here again ¶ ¶ Christmas time Is here again ¶ ¶ Nonstop with some magic ¶ Ha-ha! I managed to tap into her system. Whoo! ¶ Christmastime ¶ ¶ Christmastime Is here again ¶ ¶ Christmastime Is here again ¶ ¶ Christmastime ¶ Oh, yes! Yahoo! ¶ Christmastime Is here again ¶ It's an old system, but it does have a firewall and the firewall is... - [beeping] - [Sammy] Oh, no way! "Invaders from Galaxy D"? Oh, you know, I can beat it, Dad. This is above my pay grade, bud. Once we get that direct link, it's gonna be your time to shine. [Chimes] [wind whistling] I'm sorry there isn't more room in the sleigh. Uh, just bring that globe back. And please bring the kids back safe and sound. We're gonna be fine, guys. Be careful, okay? - We love you. - We love you. Oh, come on. Mom, Dad, we're gonna be fine. I promise, they're gonna be perfectly safe. - All set? - Yes! Here we go! - [Reins snap] - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! [Bells jingling] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are those things? It's a candy cannon. Turns a surly elf into a happy elf. A surly elf? La Befana has an army of surly elves that do her bidding. What? We just sent our kids into an army of surly elves? You didn't tell us that. What else didn't you tell us, that the elves eat children? Oh, no, don't worry. They eat cold soup. Let's go. - We're going. - Yup. [Candy cannon cocks] Okay, let's kick some tuchus. [Static crackling] - [music playing] - Hello, world. I am La Befana, the Elf Queen. As you undoubtedly know, maybe by the lack of presents underneath your tree, Christmas has been canceled due to a change in management. Santa smells like old farts and he's been fired. So from now until the end of time, I'm in charge, and there will be a new holiday on December 25th: Befanaday. It's a celebration dedicated to me, and all of you greedy little brats will receive one present from me and you will like it. Coal is still very much an option and the naughty and nice list is out because I despise all children equally. Thank you very much, and merry Befanaday. [Music plays] - And cut. - [Bell ringing] [man on speaker] Okay, everybody, on standby. Nice cut. [La Befana] So? Well, how great was that? I mean, really, I just knocked it right out of the ice castle. Um, yeah, honestly, we all agree that was not good. We need to try that again. Well, I thought that was absolutely marvelous. You kind of sucked eggs. We envisioned your image as a loving mother goose swaddling her goslings for Befanaday. Mmm! Ah-cha! [Croaking] Does anyone else think I need another take? [All] No. Very good. Well, then moving on. [Croaking] [announcer] Here she is! [Crowd cheering] The queen you've all been waiting for: La Befana! [Music playing] [laughing] Hello, my puppets! [Laughs] Ah! Yes. Yes. Ah! And now, our very special guest of the evening, Snow Globe. - [Crowd oohing] - Take a bow, my friend. And now, we have very little time to make sure that we fill our order of Thingy-ma-bobs, so that all the good little boys and girls, and some of the bad ones, get their Thingy-ma-bob for La Befanaday. [Crowd cheering] - Get to work. - [Whistle tooting] [machinery clanking] And where have you two been? Playing. We were standing guard in case Santa tries anything. Oh, he's at home crying like a little baby because I won, he lost, game over, boo-hoo. [Both mocking] [laughing] But just in case, keep guard. [Giggling] [wind whooshing] All right, so put this next to her computer system. Then I'll use Dad's coding software to hack into the firewall and play the game. Simple, really. Easy for you to say. - You're not invading a den of angry elves. - [Scoffs] Uh, surly elves are not angry per se... Well, that's about it. All right. Good luck, kiddo. Don't let the world down. No pressure. - On three. - Okay. One, two... [both] And she's gone. Huh? Hey, what's your haps? The workshop's this way. [Softly] You got this. Uh, I know where the workshop is, uh, yo. Just takin' a break to clear my head. Who are you? Elves don't take breaks. Did I say break? I meant breakdance. [Upbeat music] Yo, that was hype. You haven't seen the half of it. Reverse. [Upbeat music plays in reverse] Dang, girl, that was righteous! Sure thing, Homie G. Yeah, but this isn't Dancing with the Elves, so get back to work! Don't gotta tell me twice. [Machinery clanking] What are these things? We're not supposed to rap at the tables or B-dub dunks us in the toilet. Sick! Who's B-dub? La Befana. You heard of her? Now, come on, home slice, we've only been calling her that for about 700 years. Oh, yeah, B-dub, right. I thought you said "D." Ho, ho, ho. I'm watching you. [Fingers drumming] What? I'm nervous. [Fingers drumming] Come on, Jen. Come on, Jen. Oh, please do hurry, Jen. I gotta go to the little girls'-- I mean, the elves' room. Oh! Oh! Thank you. - [Beeping] - Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Now, we only have 20 minutes till sweet, sweet revenge is mine. So all of you have to work really hard to make sure that all those kids get their one and only La Befanaday present. And we wouldn't want anyone to be sad, now, would we? Of course we would. [Laughs] Oh! [Beeping] Excuse me. [Computer] All systems ready. What did you do? [Dramatic music] [Sammy gasps] [beeping] - Wha-- - She did it. - Ooh. - She did it! - Oh! [Chuckles] - I'm in! [Beeping] [zapping] I... This. What is this? This is all wrong! [Santa] Ooh, here they come. Here we go. - Oh! - Oh, great. That's all right. We've got two lives left. You don't even need both of them. - You got two left. It's okay. - Two left, two left. I gave you all very clear instructions, and look at this. A defect. No child is ever gonna want to work with this. Sure they would. You just have to know how to use it. Let me show you. [Elves] Ooh! [Zapping] - Oh! - [Game ends] [sighs] Santa, I have one life left. You can do it, Sammy. You just have to believe in yourself. - [Sighs] Okay. - [Presses key] - Right. You can do it. - [Game zapping] It's fun to see how fast it can go. How did you know how to do that? It was simple. Whoever came up with this toy is pretty cool. I mean, it's so fun. "Cool"? No one has ever called me cool. [Elves] Ooh! - [Inhales] It's too close, Santa. - Ooh! [Zapping] [elves] Ooh! Oh, you're almost there, Sammy. You're almost there. - [Explosion] - [zapping] Zig! Zig! [Victorious tone] [computer] You win! - Oh! - Oh, I won! Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. - [Beeping] - [computer] Overload! [Alarm blaring] Warning! Overload! - Look, the enchantment's down. - Oh! Who are you? I am Jen Nolan, and my family just saved Christmas. - [Computer] Warning! Overload! - Oh! Ow! Oh! [Fanfare] Charge! Go get 'em, guys! Ho, ho, ho, ho! Santa, can I go too? Sure, why not? - Yes. - Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. [Grumpy] I'm coming for you, La Befana. - Oh, wish me luck. - Good luck, Sammy. Charge! [Sighs] Oh, wait for me. - [Alarm blaring] - [computer] Warning! Overload! [Elves yelling] [computer] Warning! Overload! - [Clamoring] - [candy cannon firing] Warning! [Candy cannon firing] [elves laughing] [computer] Warning! Overload! Jen! [Goon] Hey! If anyone's gonna give the snow globe back to Santa, I want to. Sammy! Dad! Go deep! [In slow-motion] Use both hands! [In slow-motion] I know! Yeah! You fart sniffer! Hey, Goon. Sniff this. [Laughing] You got wrecked, boy! [Blows raspberry] [laughing] [La Befana laughing] Who shot her? Did you? I didn't. Did you? Not me. You? - I will. - No, stop. La Befana? [Laughing] Oh! It works, and it makes you happy. Try it. You've gotta try it. - Put it on your finger like this... - Mm-hmm. - ...you put your thumb like that... - Mm-hmm. ...and spin. [Both gasp] [Santa] Oh, that is fun. - Yeah. - Oh, that's very fun. [Both laughing] This isn't a reject. It's marvelous! How did you figure it out? It took a child to figure it out. Jen Nolan. Well, La Befana, neither this, nor you, are a reject. As a matter of fact, Bollowillow, remember that stocking stuffer we needed? - Yes, Santa. - [Santa] Well, we have it! The Thingy-ma-bob! Get everyone to work. - We don't have a moment to lose. - But, Santa-- Oh, no buts, no futz, no coconuts. Just make it happen. [Chuckles] - La Befana? - Hmm? When I first came to the North Pole, everyone found a place in the village but you, and... I didn't pay enough attention to help you out. So for that, I want to say... that I'm sorry. And I want to offer you a job as lead stocking stuffer inventor. - [Gasps] - Hmm? - I have a job? - Mm-hmm. I have a job? [Chuckles] Mm-hmm. I have a job! [Both laugh] Well, thank you very much. That's all I've ever wanted. I have a job! ¶ I have a job ¶ ¶ A job ¶ Well, I feel like we need a group hug. - Group hug! - Group hug! [Both laughing] Oh, my God, this is good. Oh, you smell like Cinnamon Bears. [All laughing] Oh, this is good. This is good! [Laughter echoes] [chimes] Oh, dear! That means it's time for you to go. Do we have to? Oh, yes. If you don't leave now, you'll be trapped here forever. Contrary to popular belief, Santa is not always right, but he certainly was with you guys. Oh, I will miss you. I have to thank you, big guy, for helping me realize what's really important. We owe you so much, Santa. Oh, Valerie, here's the joy of being Santa Claus. I never ask for anything in return. Oh! [Chuckles] Hey, you read my letter, didn't you? Sammy, in all my years of being Santa Claus, that Christmas list... is the most important one I've ever gotten. Now, family will change form as you go through life... but families are forever. And that's the best gift for Christmas I could ever give you. - [Patting back] - [sighs] [sighs] [La Befana] Goodbye, Nolans. I probably won't miss you. Oh, well, that's a lie. I... I... I miss you already. - [Santa laughs] - [all chuckle] [chiming] Oh, oh, there's only three bells left. Hurry! Hurry! Hands on. Everybody touch. Now, one, two... three. - [Wind whooshing] - [all] Whoa! [Birds chirping] - Wake up! It's Christmas! Wake up! - [Gasps] Whoa! Jen, I had the most amazing dream. It wasn't a dream, silly. We met Santa. Now come on, it's Christmas. Come on, come on! It's Christmas! Come on! It's Christmas! [Both] Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Check it out. - [Doorbell rings] - [knocking] - Who's here? [Knocking] [record scratches] It's David. What? Hey, Val! Where have you been? I've been freaking out. I mean, I've not slept. I've had more coffee than an elephant should drink. I mean, look, look at it. It's all over me. [Grunts] I keep doing that. What's wrong with... Look, listen, I need your help, okay? P&J wanna drop the account. Well, call Kate. I'm yesterday's news. Huh... What? You heard that? No, no, no, no. Listen, I'm so sorry. Kate took a directing job up north. I can't even get a hold of her. She won't return my calls. Please, you're my only hope. David, it is Christmas. Christmas! Who cares about Christmas? It's just another day. Please. Look, Val, if you don't do this, I am gonna-- [grunts] Look, Val, if you don't help me, you'll never work in this town again. I promise. Goodbye! Merry Christmas! The house! Hey, okay, you have a kitchen! Hey, please, I need your help. Come on. Hey! [Valerie and Sammy sigh] [laughing] Glad he's gone! [Doorbell rings] Delivery! Merry Christmas. What is it? [Laughs] Try-hard. I think it's my severance check. Well, open it. Val, I can't. Will you, please? - Yes. - Come on, kids. What do you think? [Sammy] I don't know. I was about to organize-- Josh. - Josh! - [Josh] Hmm? [Exhales] This isn't your severance check. Then what is it? It's an offer to buy your video game. - What? - Yes! "Due to a spike in Christmas sales, we would like to purchase the worldwide rights to Rainbow Unicorn Zombies for... - $500,000." - Yes! - Val! - I know! - Merry Christmas! [Laughs] - Merry Christmas! Group hug, kids! Come here! - Oh! - Merry Christmas! Mom, Dad, can we go open presents now? - Yes, go open your gifts. - Of course. It's been a very special Christmas. It's a very special Christmas. I love you. I love you too. Come on. [Mrs. Claus] And that's how the Nolan family saved Christmas. La Befana found Christmas spirit and all the surly elves have been returned to happy elves. That is, except for one. [Elf] I hate this stinking little, goody two-shoe little Christmas! [Maniacal laughter] [laughter echoing] But I'll save that tale for another time. Merry Christmas. ¶ Christmastime ¶ ¶ Christmastime ¶ So, the reason I have called you all here today is because I have come up with a new stocking stuffer. Voilà! ¶ Christmastime ¶ Who is that? Madonna? Oh, no. No, that's moi! Well, does it spin? No. But if you push the button... I'm so bad, it's good. [Elves chattering excitedly] [laughing] Yes! Grumpy? Do you have any input? I think it's rather pleasant, but the hair fibers are all wrong. Perhaps we should contact a mate I have in China. His doll hair is supreme. Otherwise, I rather like it. Yes, yes. [Laughs] [all laughing] Oh, it's too much. [Sighs] I've got to work on that. Santa, now that Christmas is saved, I was wondering if I can take the sleigh for a spin. Ho, ho, hold on. If I give you the sleigh, then everybody's gonna want the sleigh, and we don't have that in-- Dude, Franklin Mint, La Befana... Y'all playing with dolls? Uh, yeah? I like dolls. Oh, okay! You can have the fat guy. ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Good tidings we bring To you and your kin ¶ ¶ Good tidings for Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ And a cup of good cheer ¶ ¶ We won't go Until we get some ¶ ¶ We won't go Until we get some ¶ ¶ We won't go Until we get some ¶ ¶ So bring some out here ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Good tidings we bring To you and your kin ¶ ¶ Good tidings for Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ Oh, bring us A figgy pudding ¶ ¶ And a cup of good cheer ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ We wish you A merry Christmas ¶ ¶ And a Happy New Year ¶ ¶ Deck the halls With boughs of holly ¶ ¶ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ¶ ¶ 'Tis the season To be jolly ¶ ¶ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ¶ ¶ Don we now our gay apparel ¶ ¶ Fa-la-la, la-la-la La-la-la ¶ ¶ Troll the ancient Yuletide carol ¶ ¶ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ¶ ¶ See the blazing yule Before us ¶ ¶ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ¶ ¶ Strike the harp And join the chorus... ¶
