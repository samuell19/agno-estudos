How long must we wait? -They'll be here soon. Eleven cases pending. I need at least eight people. Alright, sir. -We'll remand them today itself. Don't know how many we'll get. -Cops from other stations are here too. We'll see. What's taking so long? -They'll be here, sir. The jailer, sir. Sir... -Must I handle it myself? I'll talk to the jailer myself, sir. New recruit, eh? -Yes, sir. Move aside! What caste are you? -Koravar, sir. Theft case? -Yes. Stand aside. Get going! Go, man! What caste? -Devar, sir. Leave. What are you? -Koravar. Stand aside. Vanniyar, sir. -Leave. What caste? -Irula, sir. They framed me on a false charge, sir. As if he's a lord! "Framed on a false charge", it seems! Stand aside! I'm Ottar, sir. Stand aside! What are you? -Koravar. Stand aside! Gounder, sir. -Leave. Naidu, sir. -Leave. Mudaliar, sir. -Leave. What are you? Koravar, sir. -Stand aside! Why has nobody come to receive them, sir? Are they orphans? You could say that. Send them away. Don't let them dawdle. -What? Clear them out! Twelve guys in all. Six from Koravars. Four Irulas. Two from Ottar. They are drawing attention. Get them away quick. Plenty of pending cases. We'll need at least six. We're under pressure too! The Inspector himself is here! He's due for a promotion. We need to wrap up pending cases soon. We're answerable to higher-ups too. Split them fairly! As if the law says you can file only one case against someone! Slap at least two cases on each guy. Like anyone will question it! As if these guys will admit to it right away. Like you know our troubles... Get in! Everyone get in! Thought you were freeing us, but now you load us back in there? Don't hit me, sir. My wife and children are here. Get inside. -I didn't do anything. Get in, I say! I am as good as dead, dad! -Dear boy... Don't forsake my wife and child. The cops won't let me live anymore. Take care of my family. Grab him, Constable sir. Let go of my son! -I didn't do anything, sir. Let go of my boy! -Please don't hurt me! (Konamalai village, Villupuram district) Hey Sengani, get the smoke pot. I'm coming. Make it fast. I'm coming. Hold on. Hurry up, Irutappa. -I'm coming. Here you go. -Give me. Blow in. What are you doing? Blow harder. -Wait. I'll do it. So much smoke and still these don't come out. Let's see who wins today! They are coming out, dear. -Catch them. Catch them all. Got them. Look how many rats are in here! Get them. Dig deeper, Irutappa. -Got it. Okay, dearie... It's okay... That's it. Run along! Crackpot! Letting the hard-caught rats go scot free? It's a baby rat. Should we ease our hunger with that little thing? A young life? -Yes. Very well... Bring it here. -Mosakutty! I'll get the gunny bag! -What is it? I ask you to catch rats and you dig a well instead? What gives, Auntie? Won't keep your brother in line? You find it funny, eh? -What else to do? You keep digging as if for treasure! Won't I catch them if I find them? -As if! Keep digging! Watch how many rats I catch! -I've been doing that for years! (An 80s film song plays on the radio) Are you here to listen to music? Gather the grains! The song refers to your name. Why get worked up now? So that's how it goes? At this rate, you'll make a baby right on this field. Wherever you wish, I'll make a baby! Born a huntress, would I be afraid to bear a child? Alright then. Tonight's sure to be a sleepless one! Oh my! All the grain that's hidden here! Dig it up. -Here you go. It'll be all good, now. Hey! What is all this? We've caught all the rats, sir. No more snake trouble for you. You've dug up the farm like a damn flock of pigs! We'll fix it up before we leave. See to it. -Yes, sir. Big mistake letting you in the village! Offer a place to sit, you'll ask for a place to lie down! A riddle for you. Crack it if you can. Go ahead. "Little fellow makes me bend low!" Quit laughing and answer. House entrance. You have to bend low to enter, right? Wrong answer! Oh my! Come by home, brother! No. Got sacks to haul at the rice mill. -Heading there? Alright. Give a kiss to your uncle, Alli! Alright. -See you. "Despite not having eaten betel leaves or betel nuts, the lips got red." What in the world is that? Tie up the goats, Vijaya. -Move, move! Do you not hear me? -What is it? For the last time, are you coming? -Shut up and sleep. Get over here. -Let go. Look... I've been calling for so long. Why play hard to get? Must I work on you like I do the smoke pot? Here, bundle them up. The house is all damp and you try out lame charms! "Lame charms"? What? I'll build you a brick house. Hug me tight, won't you? As it is, we live on the lake bund. You think officers are going to let you build our house there? Get over here. First, fix that roof. You can fantasize later. My precious! I swear upon you! Before I die... ...you'll be the proud owner of a brick house! Playing hard to get, eh? I'm going to visit my daughter. Be back in two months. Meet the head of the municipality. -Yes, sir. Oh heavens! A snake! How many bricks have I cut out with these hands! Yet, I cannot build one brick house of my own. Rajakannu! -Yes? There's a snake at the house of the Ramapuram President. Hurry! On my way! Sengani? -Yes? Get the medicine. O Goddess... -O dear Goddess... Take this too. Eat it. -Alright. See you. -Be careful. If my uncle comes, have him fix it up. Let's go, brother. All the firewood got wet. I'll put them out to dry. Run! -Move aside, sister. Did it go in here? -Right there. Come here. It was there, wasn't it? That's where it went. Why leave the closet open like this, you idiot? I was way too panicked to do anything! O Dear Goddess! Damn! I have to deal with this ahead of the trip. Did he find it? -I don't know. Maybe he got it. Sir? It's not here, sir. Here's your earring, ma'am. Checked the jewellery closet? -Hey! How could it get in there? -What if that damn snake bites me? You dunce! Come, come... That's it... That's it. Of all places, you preferred the President's house for feast, eh? Why the hell are you coddling it? Kill it and toss it away! -What will this poor thing do, sir? God smeared venom on its fangs and it gets whacked everywhere it goes. If not for it, this town will be infested with rats. I'll release it into the woods. -Do whatever you want. Go! Nothing to see here! Go away! -Here you go. What the hell were you doing all this while? Couldn't you have gotten it started? -I'll check. Give the car a push! -Yes, sir! Will the car make it to town? Stop. Come here. -Alright! Yes? Here. -Oh please, sir! Why pay for a favour? No need. -Alright. Moreover, ma'am comes from my village. -From your village? Next, you'll say I'm your relative! Since when is your place part of the village? Diesel tank full? Get going. -Yes, sir. A new dawn has come! A new dawn has come to our people here in Konamalai! "Arivoli" (Adult literacy) classes are about to begin! Welcome, ladies and gents! Only teacher ma'am here addresses us with respect! If there are two of these strokes it's pronounced 'ed'. "Ed. -Ed." "Deed. -Deed." "Re... -Re..." "Ad -Ad." "Read. -Read." "Read the deed." "Read the deed." "Deed. -Deed." Teacher ma'am! No matter what we do, none of us can get a land title deed. And you tell us about reading the deed? No, we don't get it! Learn to read. Everything else will follow. Who cares if you learn to read or not? Tribals should stay in the hills. Instead, you come into town and nag about Tribe certificates and whatnot! Calling him an 'Irula' isn't enough. Does he know to catch snakes? So as to not catch snakes all his life, he wants to study. He's bright. If you get him a caste certificate... Welcome, sir! Have a seat. Is he your son? Yes. -Sit, dear boy. What's up, sir? -About my son's certificate.... The caste certificate... You have no land to live on. You have no ration card. Your names aren't on the voter list. On what grounds do I give you a scheduled tribe certificate? File a petition at the collector's office. Let him say so, and I'll give it to you. Now go. Get going! Tell me, sir. We ask for one certificate, and he demands ten of those from us? Let's catch a cobra and let it loose in his office. Then, they have to come to us, for sure! Be quiet. As it is, they are not letting us in there. This is Akasagarudan! This is Navakunji! This is Kattuvirali! Along with Nelevembu, Etti, Veleruku, Kundumani, Kattusirigam, Thumbai... The leaves, twigs, rinds and roots of sixteen such herbal plants... ...must all be collected, dried under the shade... ...ground to a powder and stored away safely! This Nelavembu plant here? If you can't taste its bitterness... ...it means the snake's venom has reached the brain! Very tricky recovery indeed! No more sorrow. Only good things will happen! Dear! What is it? Why don't you dance? What's wrong? -Come here. Come closer. Remember I said I'll make a baby wherever you want me to... My girl... -What is it? You're going to have a little brother, Alli! 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' 'We are the royals who glimpse the skies through our holed roofs' 'We protect these forests and highlands' 'We outdo each other at hard labor' 'We are magicians who make springs gush even in the drylands' 'We are a clan that was born to thrive' 'We are innocent folks, indeed' Teacher madam, have honey from up the hill. You'll live to be a hundred. Thank you. -Alright. 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' 'We are the royals who glimpse the skies through our holed roofs' 'We protect these forests and highlands' 'We outdo each other at hard labor' 'We are magicians who make springs gush even in the drylands' He's been bitten by a viper, Kaniamma! 'Over here... Over there...' 'Over here... Over there...' 'As I listen to your luscious voice, the skies above vanish' 'At the touch of your gentle hands, the world entire appears to vanish' 'As you lean on my bosom, your sleep sure does vanish' 'In the fire of your hot breath, my shyness vanishes' 'My hen, as you graze away, the forest entire seems to vanish' 'As you tie me in your embrace, I see my lives entire vanish' 'To discover all that has vanished, dance with me for all time' 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' 'We are the royals who glimpse the skies through our holed roofs' 'We protect these forests and highlands' 'We outdo each other at hard labor' 'We are magicians who make springs gush even in the drylands' 'We are a clan that was born to thrive' 'We are innocent folks, indeed' 'Be it more or less, we never forget to share' 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' Only staying away from humans will do you good! Got it? Get going. 'We are a band of hunters' 'We are a tribe of bowmen' Have Durai's guys reached yet? They reached the kiln early yesterday. -That soon? When do we reach if we leave so late? -We'll be in good time. I'll go with you, dear. -Hey! Am I going to a faraway land? Will hunting squirrels and hares and running behind you be enough? Up to two kids now, right? How else do we earn? Advance payment from the brick kiln. Go wherever. But, take me with you. Must you burn at the kiln's fire too? Burning there is nothing compared to being away from you! Must the little one suffer too? Look at me. Sengani! Look at me! If you come there as well, Alli can't go to school. Won't her studies be spoilt? You take good care of the kids. I'll earn our living. Are you coming or not, Rajakannu? -On my way, brother. See me off without these tears, Sengani. I'll get going. Be safe, alright? As if wed yesterday, they are standing entwined like two snakes! Won't you smile? Shall I go? Take care! Alli! Don't give your mother any trouble. Go to school without tantrums. -Alright, dad. One for your dad? Shall I go? Let's go, brother. About time! -See you. He won't leave his wife's side! Listen up, Ezhumalai! Go to school without making a fuss! -Alright, brother. Take this. Study well. -Alright. Quit looking back! Just keep moving. "You can see the flowers. But can't see the fruit." What is it? See the flowers... Not see the fruit? -Take a guess. I don't know, brother. Think hard! Think it over! -Alright! Coming through! Hey Rajakannu, you slog away doing two people's work! If you had brought your wife, she'd have been of some help. What, she thinks herself a queen? My wife is indeed my queen! Expect me to have my pregnant wife suffer here? You are telling that to a woman who birthed and raised eight kids here? "Eight kids"? -Yeah! Your husband didn't work just the kiln, did he? Believe me, sir. All of them are new voters. None of them have cast a vote yet. When they don't even have ration cards, how can they be added to the voters list? Don't they need a proof of residence? Is that their fault? Nearly 50 years of independence, and they don't even have proof of residence. Please speak to the Election Commission and arrange something. Isn't it bad enough to plead with folks from lower castes to get their votes? Must we bend low in the hovels of these people too? Just stick to teaching. Get going! This Adult Literacy stuff must be axed! That will fix things! Oh no! Good grief! O Mother! I'm devastated the jewellery you lovingly gifted me has been stolen! And you just stare at me so? How is that right? The hands who stole it must go useless! His family will be ruined! No need for courts and police. That woman on the wall will take care! They dare to rob someone from the ruling party! What the hell are you cops here for? You went out of town, sir. You could've informed us before you left. Did any strangers come in here? Let me know if you suspect anyone. I don't suspect anyone. That rat catcher wisecracked asking if we'd make it to town. He jinxed us and now all is lost! Tell me who he is and I'll question him. One of those chaps from the Konamalai lake bank. His name? What's his name? -Rajakannu, sir. Rajakannu! Constable! -Yes, sir! You promised you'd stay for six months when you took the advance. I'll get back in two days. Haven't even been here a month and he wants to head home already! Why come to work if you can't be away from your family? Get back to work! 10,000 bricks need to be dispatched tomorrow! We'll get him. Be patient. We're looking for him. When? After he spends all the money he made from the loot? Then, you'll put him in prison and that will appease me, eh? Good grief! Putting our faith in you will do us no good! I'll talk to the Superintendent. I'll show you the ruling party President's clout. Wake him up and ask him. Get up! Get up, I say! Where's Rajakannu's house? -The one under the neem tree. Shut up! -Go straight. Check there, Constable! -Yes, sir! See if there's anyone there. -Yes, sir! Check that hut over there too. We don't know anything, sir! They've all gone for work! One of you head there! -Yes, sir! Get up. Where's your husband? He went out of town for work. Why are you looking for him? Which town is he off to rob? -"Rob"? Only if I question you at the station you'll open your mouth. Move! At this hour, sir? Whatever it is, I'll come by in the morning. Mom! Think you're Ms. World, eh? Come along! Come along, I say! I don't know, sir! -Keep going! Alli! -Come over here, Alli! Take care of Alli! Where is your brother? Answer me! Aren't you his uncle? -He did nothing! Get in! This woman is pregnant, sir. Really? Shall we have a baby shower and deliver her child? Do your job! Load them up! -Get in! Get in, I say! Drive! -Shut up, woman! Mom... Let's fight! Let's fight till we get justice! Let's fight! Let's fight till we get justice! Arrest them! Arrest the cop who indulged in rowdyism! Let's fight! Let's fight till we get justice! Down with it! Down with police brutality! Let's fight! Let's fight till we get justice! Down with it! Down with police brutality! Who is at fault? Lawyer or cop? Lawyer, sir. If I do not strip you off your uniform in court... Strip off a cop's uniform, will you? Send out a press release saying the Inspector's suspended. The one you beat up yesterday, is out protesting today. You call this 'thrashing'? Useless fellows. Let's fight till we get justice! Arrest them! Arrest the cop who indulged in rowdyism! Arrest them! Did you study law to cause such lawlessness? Quit making trouble and disperse quietly. Are cops born special or what? Register an FIR against the cops who defied the law. Then, come for talks. I'll arrest the lawyer who misbehaved at the station too. Cool with it? You'll arrest a lawyer? Lay a hand on one of us, if you dare! Go ahead. Try laying a hand! We go on an indefinite strike. Until the guilty cop is arrested, no more hearings at the High Court! Sit down, everyone! Down with police brutality! Down with police brutality! Down with police brutality! Sir... Come back, sir! As lawyers are protesting police brutality at the Chennai High Court... ...the one lawyer conducting a case has caused quite a stir among his peers! How come you are here, Mr. Chandru? You were the leading voice at the protest! And now you're here to try a case? The protest is to end a problem, My Lord. Not to escalate. Else, his son will remain in jail until the next hearing. Good. Glory to God Shiva! Not taking part in the protest, Mr. Shankaran? How could I, My Lord? I can't protest even against blood pressure and diabetes! I watched the show for ten minutes and came in. So, till the end, you'll just watch the show? Glory to God Shiva! Who let these people in? Sorry, My Lord. Thought the hearing was off, due to the strike. What does a government lawyer have to do with a strike? Irresponsible! Please proceed, Mr. Chandru. My Lord! All newspapers mentioned the DGP's order to only promote cops with completed cases. The next ten days, thousands of innocents were hurriedly charged and arrested. My Lord, be it whether cops do their duty, or they don't, it's wrong! This is strange logic! If they can complete the investigation in ten days... ...then, why were these left pending for years together? Strange logic, indeed! The petitioner Kaliappan's son, Kolanji. An innocent tribal. Kaliappan witnessed cops from Virudachalam assault his son and haul him away! His enquiries with the police got no response. My Lord! Kolanji is not an innocent tribal. He is a habitual offender. A serial robber. You have a copy of the FIR, right? -Yes. Can you read it to the court? "In the matter of two thefts, the cops of Virudachalam were looking for Kolanji." "On October 20, 1994 at 2 PM..." "...on receiving information, he was arrested at a bar." How is it relevant? An extract of the exit record from Cuddalore Jail. Please tell the court the time of Kolanji's release from jail. Read it aloud, sir! Four in the ev... Four in the evening! If Kolanji was in jail till 4 PM... ...how come Virudachalam cops arrested him at 2 PM? On the occurrence of both the thefts, Kolanji had been in prison, My Lord. Cops who foist false cases are the habitual offenders... Serial fake-case makers. It's not the only foisted case, My Lord. Twelve tribals who were released from jail that same day... ...were falsely charged and rearrested right outside Cuddalore Jail. Thanks to a social activist, Kaliappan made it to this courtroom. The other eleven had no such opportunity. I'm passing an order to grant bail for all twelve of them. Not just these twelve, My Lord. In the past two weeks, 7,000 such people were arrested in haste all over Tamil Nadu. We don't know how many of them are innocent. So, you expect the court to grant bail to all of them? This is ridiculous, My Lord! Citing one mistake from a random place, the counsel is misleading the court! Not one. But twelve mistakes in one place alone. It's not a question of 7 or 7,000! Whoever is affected, whatever their number, they deserve justice! This court has a moral duty to ensure that! My Lord. I appoint an investigation commission headed by a retired High Court Judge. The report must be submitted in three months. Till then, the 7,000 people arrested in those two weeks by the DGP's order... ...can move the jurisdictional court for bail. Thank you, My Lord. -Excellent! Great, Chandru. 7,000 birds with one stone! 7,000 humans, sir. Glory to God Shiva... 'Take the power in your hand' 'Dare to take the power in your hand' 'You have no choice but that' 'Reclaim the power' 'Demand the power' 'For it is the only way to walk with our heads held high' With just one case, that lawyer humiliated the entire police force! Tell your department folks to at least do the wrong right! I'm sorry, sir. 'No compromise... It's a battle for your equal rights' 'No more grief... Rise up' 'Let the gaze of simple folks light up' 'Proclaim the path to a new beginning' Can Aavin workers be fired for seeking wage increase? Do not see this as a case involving 800 workers! The future of 800 families is at stake! '...when we are here, there will be change' 'Take the power in your hand' 'Dare to take the power in your hand' 'You have no choice but that' 'Reclaim the power' 'Demand the power' Law is a very powerful weapon! What's important is who we protect by using it. All important leaders like Gandhi and Nehru are here. How come Ambedkar alone isn't here? In the name of nabbing Veerappan, those people caught and tortured... ...tribals on the hills! Are they a hit squad? Down with unlawful violations! Look how he badmouths cops right in front of us! What's ugly is not just his words, but also our actions. Why so much anger against cops? Why so much hatred? It's not hatred against anyone. It's love and care towards the society. The cops feel the same love and care. Really? There's a blockade planned. Please participate. How are you, comrade? 'No more grief... Rise up' (Blockade protesting DGP's arrogance) 'Proclaim the path to a new beginning' "We want untouchability to be abolished." "We have been carrying on with untouchability for the last 2,000 years." "Nobody has bothered about it!" "Nobody has bothered about it!" 'Who are you to order me around?' By the order of the Supreme Court, convicts cannot be handcuffed in court. 'Meek sheep, we are not... Think not you can make us submit' 'Weapons, there aren't many...

Let it flourish! -Turn that auto away! Let workers' unity flourish! Two minutes, sir. A pregnant woman inside. -Move out! Let it flourish! -Stay here. I'll inform him. Let workers' unity flourish! Let it flourish! -Sir! They've come to meet you. Mr. Kalyani referred you to them. Take them home. Now go. -Yes, sir. Do not assault the livelihood of workers! Let workers' unity flourish! Do not assault! Do not assault the livelihood of workers! Do not assault! Do not assault the livelihood of workers! Let it flourish! Sengani? Please have a seat. Describe everything that happened. Don't overstate or understate anything. Get it? Where is Rajakannu's house? Where is your husband? Where is your brother? Tell me! Will you shut up or not? Mom... A low-paid manual labourer, she is. But, see how that stolen wedding pendant dangles? When we have the strength to earn our living, why must we steal? Shut up! I'll stir the baton in your mouth! Where does Rajakannu's brother live? That hut over there. Who's in there? -Who is it? Open the door! -Who is it? No! Asleep after the theft? Where is your brother? I didn't do any wrong! Leave me be! -Answer me! Don't hit him, sir! -Drag him along! Come along! -Shut up! Shut up! -Grab him! Shut up, I say! Go that side! Get in the van! -Come! Start up! -Sir! Irutappan's been working for me for years! He's no thief! His brother is a prime suspect. I'll question him and let him go. Drive. -Hold on.. Wait, Parvathi! Get a hold of her. -My dear! Don't cry, Parvathi. You say he was at the kiln until yesterday. Where is he now? The money got to his head, sir! He ran off without telling me. Is that so? You turn up so late? -I couldn't get a bus, sir. Get up, all of you! Get up, you! Is this a motel? Stretched out like he's royalty! Get up! Get up! Must I repeat myself to everyone? Weren't you thrashed enough last night? Get up, woman! Get up! Are you really pregnant or are you smuggling illicit liquor? SI Gurumurthy. -This is the SP. Hello, sir! -What became of Mr. Kathirvel's case? The prime suspect is missing. We'll get him by tomorrow! Same excuse every time! My damn fate to run these police stations with useless people like you! We'll get him. -They are grilling me no end! I'm sorry! -I need him found in two days! If not, you're finished! -Noted, sir. Where is Rajakannu? -I don't know! Where is Rajakannu? Answer me! -Don't hit him! Lying to a cop, are you? How dare you? Back off! Where is he? Answer me! Where is he? -We don't know, sir! Is this a school to put out your hand like this? Tell me! He's just a kid. Don't hit him! You dare bring your hand near me? You dare touch me? Don't fear the cops anymore, do you? Where is he? Where is your brother? Let go of my leg! Speak up or none of you will leave here alive! Tell me where he is! Tell me where he is! Don't you know? Let me go! -Don't you know? Don't you know? Answer me! Dealing with these devils sends my blood pressure to hell! Where is his sister? Get her! -We're going there. Where is Pachaiamma's house? The one near the temple. Where have you hidden the jewels your brother stole? I don't know what you're talking about. -Get up! Answer me! -Oh God... Where did you brother run off to? Tell me where your brother is, or you'll all be thrown in jail! Why are you hitting my aunt? Move aside! -You steal as a gang, eh? Who are you? Load him in, too! -Come along! Where is Rajakannu? Tell me where he is! Don't hit us, sir! -Restrain them, Constable sir! Load them all up! Quit making a scene! Tell us where Rajakannu is! Load them all up! We didn't do anything! -Load them all up! Load them all up! Here's my stop! Pull over! Here! Give me that. Carry on. -See you! Don't touch the stuff. What are you looking for? How much is this? -Five rupees. Five rupees? Give me a good price, please. How about this one? -Same price. Oh come on! Is this a jail cell or a pig pen? Him, her, and him. Send everyone else out. Send them all out! Get up, woman! -Get up! Go out! -Get up and go! Get out. Have them wait out in the shed. -Yes, sir. Get out, you! Get going! Here. For both of you. Here you go. Eat. You don't know where he is, huh? -I don't, sir! You don't know? -I don't know! You don't know, eh? -Oh God! You don't know where he is, huh? We don't know, sir! I've been yelling myself hoarse for hours and you won't answer me? Answer me! Save us! Who the hell are you calling? Who can come in here to save you? Who will save you? -Please stop! Go sit there, you! Robbing towns in the guise of snake catching, eh? Do you steal alone or with your family? Tell me! Roll! Roll the dice! (Rajakannu sings a song) That's the guy! Nab him! Hold it right there! -What is it? Don't let him get away! -Brother! What's going on here? Bloody thief! -What's wrong? Why are you hitting me? I didn't do anything wrong. Why must I steal? Let go of me! Why are you hitting me? I didn't do anything wrong! -Grab him! I didn't do anything! Let me go! Let go of me, brother! Restrain him! -I never steal, brother! I didn't do anything wrong! You thieving swine! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything wrong! Greetings, sir. Hello, Sub-Inspector sir! Are you well? -Yes. Kathirvel called. There's your thief right there! So he's the guy? I just got back from out of town, sir! I did not steal anything! People work hard day and night to make a fortune. You make off with it easy and expect the cops to just watch the show? You dare make us chase you around? -I didn't steal, sir! Trying to run away? How long did you think you could keep this up? Get up! Ask around about me, sir! Start the vehicle! -Sir! I worked on your fields many times, sir. -Get lost! Load him up! -Tell them I do not steal, sir! Get in! -Tell them I do not steal, sir! Please believe me! Go on! Get up! I didn't steal, sir! I'm not a thief! -Dear! Drag him inside! Sengani! -Come along! I swear upon you I didn't steal! My dear! -Why did you come here? Let him go, sir! -Do not hit her, sir. Ugh! I'll burn you like the trash! Stop! Why risk another beating in there? Listen to me. Get going. If he did not steal, they'll let him go. You shouldn't be here. Bring some food when you come tomorrow. Now go! My dear! My dear! Tell them to let him go! Tell me where you hid the loot! Answer me! My dear! Hoist him up! -Please no! Raise him! -It hurts, sir! Answer me! -Let him go, sir. Tell them not to hurt him, sir. Tell me where the stolen loot is! -Or he'll get beaten! We didn't steal anything, sir. He didn't do anything wrong. Tell the truth! Do you confess? Don't hit us, sir! Why get thrashed like this? Tell us where the stolen money and jewels are! We'll release you. We swear on our families! We didn't steal! Oh... is that so? Stop it! Lower him down. Lower him down. Careful. Quit yelling! Does it hurt, dear fellow? Kiruba! -Yes? A herbal patch will heal this, right? -We didn't steal, sir. It burns! Let us go, sir! Burns, doesn't it? -Where did you stash the money and jewels? Do you not see this, O Goddess? Admit to the crime! How can I admit to a crime I did not commit, sir? I swear on my child we didn't steal! Let us go, sir! We'll leave! Don't brand us as thieves! No matter how much we beat them, they don't confess. I don't know what else we can do. Sir! We men are here, sir. Please let the woman go home. Get up. -Please don't, sir... Get up, woman! Who among them is a man? Him? Him? Or him? -Sir! Who among them is a man? Don't do this, sir! -Back off! How dare you all? -Sir! You dare order us on who should stay and who should go? Hands off! Shut up! Now do you realize who the real man is? Now do you get it? Where are you going? Oh God! -Let go! Get over here. You claim to be a man, right? Show her your talents! I'll let her go. Who among you is a man? Show me who among you is a man! She's my sister, sir! She's my sister, sir... Pachaiamma drank poison. It took four days at the hospital to save her. She has lost everything but her life! Just tell me what happened at the police station. Other things, we'll talk later. What happened the next day? Send them to eat... Who let you in? Get out! Come here, Sentry! Why are you screaming? -What are you yelling for? Come along outside! Oh my God! -Come out, I say! I'll send him. You sit outside. -Come. Quit yelling! What have you done? -Come outside! What the hell were you doing, Sentry? Just a minute. Been two years since I gave the money you asked. My juniors are getting promoted! Please see to my promotion. No matter how many times we tell them, the cops won't believe us, brother. Let's just do what they ask and confess, brother. I can't bear this pain anymore! No, Irutappa... These wounds will heal in a few days. The stamp as thieves will stay forever. Don't break. Just hold on a little longer. Just hold on. Eat. -Eat, brother. Open wider, my dear. Open wider, my dear. Oh no! Just a little more, my dear. Oh no! To brand him a thief, they've tortured him so much... ...he can't even eat one mouthful! I'll call you back. -You'll all be ruined! You dare wail at a police station? -Don't, sir. Some mishap may happen. Here, this fellow puts on a show and you're cursing me, eh? I'll slaughter you! Get in here! -Let him go! Don't forsake me, Sengani! -Let him go, sir! Do not give up on me! -My dear! You're dead meat! Get lost, woman! The two of you get up! Get back in there! Get in there! -Keep moving! He's running away, Kiruba! Get him! Nab him! -Stop! You get in there! -Where are you going? Let go of my husband, sir. Let him go, please! Let go of me, sir! Get in there! I'll break your limbs! -Let me go, sir! You dare run off under my watch? -Let me go, sir! Get in there! -Let me go, sir! Sir... -Lock him up in there! Listen... Things aren't going right. Fetch someone influential in town soon. Sir! You come wail here after the evening lamp has been lit? Don't you have all the stolen money and jewels? Go see a good lawyer then! What do we do when even you accuse us so? You are the President of this village. Please tell the cops to not beat them. That's all I ask of you. Please! Did I become President with your Irula tribe votes? The cheek of this vagrant! Get out of my sight! What is it, sir? What are you looking for now? Where is your husband? I swear he hasn't come back! All three of them got away. Inform us if they come here. Talk sense into him to surrender. If not, nobody can save them! What are you saying, sir? When did this happen? 'Why create me in this cruel world, O God?' -Please take care of Alli, sister. 'Can you not hear these screams of pain?' -Please take care of her until I get back! 'You, who is everywhere at once, why are you nowhere near now?' 'Are all the prayers I offered to you all these years not enough?' 'Is it fair if you trod upon the already beaten down unfortunate?' 'Is it right if you put out the million lights you lit yourself?' 'I stand here with tears as my companion' 'Is this my forever fate?' 'You know and see all' 'Do you not have the heart to save us?' Hold it, woman! You won't listen? Stop! Who let you in here? Get out! Did they really escape? If the Sub-Inspector sees you, who knows what he'll do in his rage! Get lost! Drive her out! Go! -Get going! 'Why do you keep sending misfortunes our way?' 'Is my life to suffer without my love?' 'I did not ask for anything' 'You gave it, then took it away' 'Without my beloved, am I to suffer all alone?' Down with police brutality! -'You revealed a life I never dreamed' 'Without seeing its moon, the sky stands defeated' Think these flags and protests will scare us? You run a party only to support thieves? All the missing people are tribals! If you don't take action, we'll complain to every high ranking official there is! Will you politicize everything? Get a complaint from that woman, Bashyam. -Yes, sir. File an FIR, conduct an inquiry and submit the report. Alright, sir. Don't have a picture? -No. How can we find a missing person without his picture? What era are you all in? Get going. Check if, fearing the cops they are hiding where other Irulas work. 'My feet are worn out from all this searching' 'I do not know where else to look' 'Smoke swirls around my eyes' 'The fire pounces till the roots' 'In emptiness, the days prolong' 'Authority plays a cruel hand...' -Where is your husband? We'll see how long he stays underground. 'No ladder in sight for this orphan to reach up' We're still looking. We'll let you know when we find anything. 'The heart flutters along like a kite without a spool' 'What will happen now?' 'Time shan't leave without an answer' Do not forsake me, Sengani! I can still hear his voice pleading as they dragged him away. We are dying like orphans with no one to care for us. Please help us, sir! Drink up. Despite searching far and wide, we couldn't find them. We don't know what to do. Evidence of the stolen jewels pawned for money. There are eyewitnesses of those three escaping town. Read the report. Don't politicize a case of robbery! Strong eyewitnesses on behalf of the police. We don't have a case to make. If they're innocent, why did they escape? If you got money, you make the laws around here! Got any? Antagonizing the police won't get our clients even a bail. Out of pity, I can give out alms. But can I take up a case? It is you we pity. Here! Only if the court steps in, there can be progress. What do we do, comrade? I have a friend who is a lawyer at the High Court. Meet him. I'll fill him in on the situation. He does not charge fees for human rights cases. I know those three men very well. They're innocent tribals. But I don't know how to prove it. We cannot find their whereabouts either. The police enquiry report. "Rajakannu, Irutappan and Mosakutty were brought in for questioning." "At 9:55 PM, on April 6, 1995..." "...they tricked the Athiyur police and escaped prison!" Where did they go? Get up, you two! -Sir! Why didn't you lock the cell? Those three escaped! What are you saying? -Are you deaf? I said they escaped! Don't just stand here! Find them! -Yes, sir! What are you saying? Inform the control room. I'm coming! Three suspects escaped from their cell. Why the hell weren't you watching them? Where's your uniform? Be ready to face the SP's fire! If those three aren't found by dawn, you're all finished! Find them quickly! (T. Pawarlal Pawn Shop) How did you treat them? They were wounded. I prescribed medicine. That's it. Three guys showed up as I was closing up. They bought the prescribed medicines. They had tattoos on their left hands. How many of them in all? -Three people, sir. I didn't know the jewels were stolen. Had I known, I wouldn't have filled out a receipt. Does this belong to you? -Yes, sir! "Going by the evidence and witnesses..." "...this inquiry proved that the three men escaped with the stolen money and jewels." Rajakannu had been to the house before the theft. Negative. Rajakannu's fingerprints were found in Kathirvel's house. Negative. There's a receipt of the jewels pawned. Negative. Strong eyewitnesses for them escaping prison and fleeing from town. Negative. Negative! The petition you'll be filing at court is 'Habeas Corpus'. A petition to produce a person in court. Any person born in this country has the right to live free. No one can be unlawfully detained by anyone else. If it happens... ...this petition can be filed in order to produce them in court. Two judges will immediately look into the petition. You file the petition, stating your husband is missing from police custody. You've named me as your lawyer. For that, I need your signature. Do you understand what I'm saying? I don't know how to sign, sir. Show me your thumb. (Alli Rajakannu) Thanks. Only now I feel hopeful Sengani's troubles are coming to an end. There are strong witnesses to Rajakannu escaping prison. Evidence is all the court cares about. The police have that. It is a very complicated case. The case we're filing with no evidence is not just against three cops. It is against all those in power. It is against this government. It will be quite an uphill battle. Get ready! This way. Please sit here. Please be seated. No matter who asks... No matter how many times they ask... ...speak only the truth. That is what will save us. Alright? Item number one. HCP: 711/1995. Counsel for the Petitionier. Mr. Chandru. Sorry, My Lord. You may proceed, Mr. Chandru. My Lords, petitioner Sengani is an Irula tribal woman. Her husband and two other tribals in police custody, are now missing. Sengani suffers not knowing her husband's whereabouts. This court is her last hope. I ask this Habeas Corpus to be accepted and to direct the govt. to file a reply. My Lords! Petitioner being a scheduled tribe... ...this petition has been made for publicity sake. Please don't waste time by entertaining it. I plead that the petition be dismissed. A habitual latecomer like the Government Advocate... ...is much worried about the court wasting time. It's funny, My Lords! Mr. Chandru, who is the petitioner? Sengani? Please go to the front. Go on. In front of my eyes, my husband was beaten and dragged away. They tell me he escaped. We looked everywhere but couldn't find him. With a baby on the way, I do not know the way out. Please find the father of my children, sir! What do you say? Do we hear this? This petition can only be filed if someone is abducted and held against their will. In this case, the three have run away. The case will be dismissed in two minutes. Glory to God Shiva... Take notice, PP. Next hearing is in three days. Issue notices to all parties. -Yes, My Lords. Thank You, My Lords. The court has admitted your petition. It will be heard in three days. Alright? -Alright, sir. Mr. Chandru! Don't assume human rights and tribes' sympathy factor will make it an easy win. Luck won't be on your side always. I don't believe in luck, sir. I believe in the truth. Come along, Alli. You can't properly interrogate three men in custody. Why the hell do you head a station? Idiot! -But, sir... Thanks to you, I'm now answerable to the High Court. Bashyam. -Sir? Talk to the PP. -Alright. When summoned, you all turn up. Alright, sir. Salute. My Lords! Rajakannu, Mosakutty and Irutappan. The three of them, even as they were questioned by the police about a theft... ...absconded from the station. Cops are conducting an intensive search. Here's the inquiry report authorized by the Superintendent. Here. My Lords! We have no faith in this police report. The prosecution has eye-witnesses to Rajakannu's escape, Mr. Chandru. Mere speculation with no proper evidence will make us dismiss this case. My Lords, for the sake of argument... Even if Rajakannu had stolen, legal action must be taken. Athiyur Police has no respect for law. No FIR registered. Severe custodial torture inflicted. We have many doubts in this police report. If witnesses are cross-examined, the truth will be brought out before this court. Witnesses cannot be cross-examined in a Habeas Corpus proceeding. I suggest he reads the law before arguing. The PP has a valid point. If you wish to examine witnesses, take it to the District Court. My Lords. During Emergency, the Kerala Police took a student named Rajan into custody. Later, they said he had escaped from custody. On entertaining a Habeas Corpus, the Kerala High Court... ...permitted cross-examination of witnesses. Many truths came out. I submit a copy of the judgment to the Honourable Judges. "1978. CrILJ 86, Para 3." I object, My Lords. This court is not bound by the decision of the Kerala High Court. Every judgment has persuasive value. This court can accept it if it wishes. No one can prevent it. My Lords... Justice denied to victims... ...can create more damage than the injustice suffered by them. My Lords, I pray that Rajan's case be taken as a precedent... ...and permission be granted for me to cross-examine government witnesses. The prosecution has nothing to lose from this cross-examination. Issue summons to all witnesses. Okay, My Lords. -Thank You, My Lords. Chandru... Excellent! Normally, this would have been dismissed in two minutes. Quoting Rajan's case? Good God, that was a wise move. The case is entirely in your favour now. No, sir. I feel I am handling this case wrongly. No, you're not. You're on the right path, I say! No, sir. I'm beginning to doubt since you are so sure. I'm sure I'm missing something! What is he... -This way, sir! Laughing, are you? Am I late? -Nothing like that. Stop, Kiruba. -Yes, sir. So he's the lawyer from Madras? Heard an independent inquiry is going on. So it's true then. Even the police couldn't do a damn thing. Only you should find those culprits, sir. Definitely. I'll find them. I'll find the real culprits very soon. Don't you worry. What are you looking at, ma'am? For the first time in Madras HC history, in a Habeas Corpus case... ...a witness stand is brought in. Not a VIP case even. An ordinary tribal woman case. Everything is in our favor. The case will be dismissed. Don't worry. -Okay. Witness number one: Dr. Mahesh. Were you the doctor who treated Rajakannu, Mosakutty and Irutappan? Yes, sir. -Okay. How long have you run the clinic? -Eight years. Great! When did you complete your degree? Why aren't you in the State's Medical Council? I'm an Ayurveda doctor, sir. I have formally registered that, sir. Then why prescribe allopathic medicines? You even have a huge sign at your clinic that reads 'Mahesh, MBBS'. Not just the witness, My Lords. Even the doctor is fake! I object to this type of cross-examination, My Lords. The question is not whether he studied Acupuncture or Ayurveda. The case is whether persons who escaped took treatment from his clinic or not. Do you have any relevant questions for this witness, Mr. Chandru? No, My Lord. Witness number two: Dhanasekar. One of them had a tattoo of a flower. Another one was short. Witness number three: Mr. Vinod. As I was closing shop at night, three men showed up. They gave me a prescription. And I gave them the medicine. Do you have any questions, Mr. Chandru? Mr. Chandru? -Do you have any relevant questions? No, My Lord. You may leave. -Alright, sir. Thought it would sizzle like firecrackers, but it has fizzled out like flat soda! The opposition could not disprove the witnesses, My Lords. I seek instant dismissal of the case. That's all. File a forgery case against Dr. Mahesh, Mr. Public Prosecutor. He is disbarred from practice. -Yes, sir! This case is dismiss... -My Lords! I wish to examine Inspector Bashyam, the inquiry officer. Why... We can't shut out. We can ask him to lead evidence. Alright. Court is adjourned. We'll continue after lunch. Thank You, My Lords. Just say what is in the report. -Alright, sir. If that lawyer tries to trip you up with his questions... ...just reply with a standard 'I don't know' or 'I don't remember'. Understood? -Yes. Remember what we discussed? -I got it. "Three escaped convicts from Athiyur got treatment..." Glory to God Shiva... Is this your report? -Yes, sir. You know fully well what's in here? Wake me up and ask and I'd still be thorough! Why? You memorized it so well? How far away from the station is the pharmacy the escapees went to? The store is called 'Om Medicals'. The salesman's name is Mr. Vinod. Don't regurgitate what you memorized. Just answer the question. Question: How far is the pharmacy from the police station? Well... I think it's a little bit away. Never mind that. How far is the pharmacy from the clinic of Dr. Mahesh, who treated the escapees? Which side of the station is it? I strongly object, My Lords. The counsel is trying to confuse and intimidate the witness. The witness is no commoner. He's an Inspector. The inquiry officer of this case. Even I'm confused, My Lords. Allow the counsel to proceed in his own way, PP. Please don't interrupt. Sit down. Continue. Well... I don't know... can't remember. Idiot! He's saying both responses... You forgot an inquiry you conducted a month ago? I say you never conducted this inquiry. This report isn't yours. -I object! I strongly object, My Lords! I strongly object to this suggestion. Do you have any proof for your claim, Counsel? I made a personal visit to that place, My Lords. Dr. Mahesh's clinic is two kilometres east of the police station. The pharmacy is one kilometre west of the police station. So, the three escapees... ...ran two kilometres east of the station... ...showed their wounds and got a prescription... ...and ran three kilometres west past the very same station... ...and bought medicines at the pharmacy. That is what Inspector Bashyam's inquiry report says! Would the escapees be doing catwalk in front of the police station? Would he give such a report if he investigated it himself? No! I did investigate! I don't remember. I forgot... One or the other! My Lords. A photocopy of the report Inspector Bashyam submitted to the SP of Villupuram. The FIR and chargesheet from Veerasamy, the writer at Athiyur police station. My Lords. With east and west, the counsel has already confused the witness. And now, these papers. What does this case have to do with these photocopies? Only your inquiry officer can answer that! Why does the handwriting on his report... ...and writer Veerasamy's handwriting look the same? I'm sorry, My Lords. In an attempt to help my fellow officers... ...I signed the report given by them. Who the hell made you a cop? Is this how one responds in court? Nonsense! How do you respond to this, PP? What is there to say, My Lords? I have nothing to say. Good thing. At least you didn't respond saying 'don't know', 'don't remember'! That will do. -Glory to God Shiva... Do you admit to being a false witness? Let's see if my case comes up now. Glory to God Shiva... I can't refuse the police's demands, sir. So... It is an utter disgrace... ...that the evidence submitted by the police, is fully fake. The petition filed by Sengani is prima facie valid. Six months imprisonment for the two who committed perjury. We direct you to file a government report within seven days, Mr. Public Prosecutor. The department has to conduct an inquiry on Inspector Bashyam. When will they find my husband, sir? We will find him very soon. Come along. Good morning, sir. (High Court condemns) It's become a routine to be humiliated by that lawyer. Must we stand ashamed in court because of you? No, sir... -Huh? You let a tribal woman enter the High Court. Why the hell are you even a cop? Be bloody honest with me. Did you remand them in false cases? Not at all, sir! They escaped from prison. As it was night, there were no witnesses... If I tell that to the judge... ...he'll ask who the hell gave me a law degree! I'm sorry, sir. If we are disgraced in court, it's as if the government is disgraced! Where is that case file? Now on, I will lead the case myself! 'A pearl sought in the deep sea' 'A bud bloomed out of deep love' 'My Rajakannu' 'One in a million' 'A pearl sought in the deep sea' 'As a marigold, you spread fragrance in my heart' 'As a tender cane, you usher sweetness in my life' 'As a marigold, you spread fragrance in my heart' 'As a tender cane, you usher sweetness in my life' 'A hundred flower shops on the street but I seek your scent as my only treat' 'As a marigold, you spread fragrance in my heart' I'll build you a brick house. Hug me tight, won't you? 'The brilliant plume that appeared in my dream...' '...now walks beside me as my shade and beloved' 'At the edge of the scrub jungle...' '...you and me were born to play like two bunnies together' 'The blowing wind is all we need' 'As a marigold, you spread fragrance in my heart' 'As a tender cane, you usher sweetness in my life' The village has got a bad name, thanks to you! Think you can survive antagonizing the village and the cops? We give you a place to live and work and it gets to your head? How long will it take for us to burn down your huts? Bloody withdraw this case! Stay safe, Alli. -Alright, mom. Sengani speaking, sir. Stay by the phone. Sir will call back. Alright, sir. He said he will call back. -Alright. Hey, the SI sent for you. Come. I won't come anywhere without my lawyer's say-so. Mom! Alli! -Mom! Drive! Quick! -Mom! Alli! -Shut up, girl! Alli! -Mom! Let go of my daughter, sir! -Drive faster! Oh God! Alli! Save my daughter, O dear God! Alli! What will I do now? My daughter is gone! If you don't withdraw this case, I'll lose my job. My family will end up destitute. Listen up. We'll pay you how much ever you want. Just withdraw the case. We'll even find your husband soon. Whatever it is, talk to my lawyer. Why I ought to... Gotten cocky, eh? The cops are pleading so much and you, a damn woman... Citing the law, are you? You and your people won't make a living anywhere. I will finish you all! Unless you sign here, you cannot leave! Think the lawyer can save you all the time? Hello? -This is the DGP speaking. Hello, sir! It's the Director General of Police. Good day, sir! Is someone called 'Sengani' there now? I brought her in for a small inquiry... I'll skewer you! Spinning me tales, eh? The High Court is tearing me apart! I'll release her immediately, sir. Drop her back home in the police jeep. If not, you'll all be arrested! Alright, sir... -Hang up! Alli! My daughter... It's for you, ma'am! Come! They took away Alli, sir. Go to the police station. I'll handle it. Yes, My Lord. Ma'am... Hold up, ma'am. Wait up! Get in the jeep. We'll drop you. Ma'am? They've told us to drop you home. Please get in. Hurry up, man! Come here, sir. What's going on? -The DGP ordered us to drop her home. "The DGP"? The hearing is at 10:30? -Yes, sir. You informed the judges I'll be appearing? -Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. Greetings. -Greetings. Good morning. How are you, sir? I'm fine, My Lords. Thank you. Sengani! Any further trouble from the police? No, sir. -Good. HCP: 711. Respondent, Advocate General. My Lords. I'd like to call the witness Dhanasekar, the tea shop person. Tell the court what you witnessed. Three men came to the shop and drank tea. They were there for a while. A lorry heading to Kerala pulled up near the shop. They got on board and left. My Lords, please permit the prosecution to examine a key witness. There is no prior request. Who is this witness? Varadarajalu. Rice mill owner. We just learned of this yesterday. An important witness, My Lords. Any objection, Mr. Chandru? No, My Lords. You may proceed, Advocate General. Witness number five: Mr. Varadarajalu. -Thank You, My Lords. Tell the court exactly what you know. As I was leaving the mill that day, I got a phone call. Hello? -This is Irutappa speaking, sir! Where in the world are you? We escaped from the police and got out of town! We're fine, sir. We'll be back once it's all clear. Never mind all that! Where are you? Please let our families know. Hello? It was Irutappan, my mill worker, who had called. How are you sure it was Irutappan on the phone? He's been working for me for over ten years. Won't I know his voice? That's all, My Lords. This is just another political stunt. An attempt to humiliate the government. That's all! Why didn't you tell the cops earlier? They only asked me about this yesterday. You should've at least told the families. Another fake witness from the prosecution... I did. I got all three families together and told them! You can ask Sengani about it. Look how the AG flipped this case with just one witness. Sengani is well aware of Rajakannu's whereabouts. This case has been filed with some ulterior motive. She's a pitiful tribal woman. She's innocent. I think someone is misguiding her so as to claim compensation from the government. Many people from this community are habitual offenders. They hide away in Andhra Pradesh or Kerala. Could you please submit these documents? The cops are actively looking for them. So, the court can dismiss this case. I need some more time, My Lords. The AG has proved beyond any doubt Rajakannu escaped police custody. Why do you need more time? How can I cross-examine a witness without preparing, My Lords? This is a genuine request. The court should not deny it. For what it's worth, let him have it. -Yeah. Okay. Time granted. -Thank You, My Lords. Item number two: CMP 442 of 1995. Counsel for Petitioner. Even if you had no proof or witnesses, I believed you had the truth. It's my fault. I stood there looking like a fool! That's my fault too! Why did you hide the truth? Don't you hear me? Why didn't you tell the truth? I told her not to tell you. When they heard about the phone call, no lawyer would take the case. That's why, we thought it was best to leave it out. I won't handle this case anymore. Find another lawyer. You may leave. Please be patient and listen to what I have to say. There is no chance Irutappan could've made that call. I've taught adult literacy classes for the rice mill workers. It's not just Irutappan. None of them know the alphabet or numbers! Irutappa! -Ma'am? How many sacks needed for this grain? Around eight, teacher. Which among these is number eight? I don't know, teacher. -You don't know? This is number eight. Got it? Dialing an STD code on top of all that is simply impossible! Please... Did the rice mill owner say what was the date of the call? The day before the full moon day of the month. The phone records you requested. Hello? Do you know 'Varadarajalu rice mill'? -Yes, I do. Is that so? Where is your house? -Villupuram. Villupuram? -Why do you ask? To deliver sweets for Diwali. -My address is... I have the address. I'll send it. Thank you. Do you know 'Varadarajalu rice mill'? -Yes. My sister's husband owns it. Just checking if our load had arrived. That's all. Thanks. 241... Yes, I know of it. -I know it. Hello? Who is it? I'm calling from 'Varadarajalu rice mill'. This number... This is an STD booth. STD... -This is Kerala. That's fine... Where in Kerala? -What? (in Malayalam) Where in Kerala? Well... Near Munnar, sir. Your name please? My name is Rajesh. Rajesh? -Yes. What's this about? -It's nothing. Thanks. Mythra. I checked all the calls. One call has come from a public booth in Kerala. Only if we go there we can find out for sure. Will Sengani be able to come that far? I will go wherever this takes us, sir. Sir... 'The caressing young breeze brings us a new message' 'Seeds that transform into trees show us how to live' 'Do not lose faith deep in your heart' 'There is no night that does not see a dawn' I need some information, brother. We're looking for three missing men. One of them is short. They're Tamilians. Do you know of them? This state maybe Kerala. But everyone who works here are Tamilians. They made a call from this STD booth. A month ago. Please try and remember. There are plenty of estates here. Try looking there. 'The caressing young breeze brings us a new message' 'Seeds that transform into trees show us how to live' 'Do not lose faith deep in your heart' 'There is no night that does not see a dawn' 'So close, so close...' '...does the shadow stand' 'So close, so close does the shadow stand' 'If you trust in you and walk ahead, the unseen path will unfold' 'Stop not... Walk on' 'Why the tears in your eyes?' 'Stop not... Walk on' 'With love, join hands' 'Join hands together' Show me your hand. Stretch it out like this and place it here. Better now? Sir... You're doing us a huge help. But... I have no money to give you. To sell and raise money... ...this is all I have. He worked a lot to get me this golden wedding pendant. If not for that, I'd have sold it and paid you. I wasn't born a lawyer. I was born just a human. Suppose a snakebite victim comes to you, struggling for life. Will you turn him away if he had no money? Never! Is life and money the same? Even if it were those cops, I'd still treat them. The respect a person's talent gets depends on what they use it for. When people like you get justice, that day, I sleep soundly. That is my fee! 'Is there a land without the safe, blue roof above?' 'A friend called time walks along with you' 'Break those barriers' 'Will everything change on its own?' 'Keep fighting and justice will be done one day' 'If you rise above the darkness, the morning light will welcome you' 'A day that will lift us up...

'There is no night without a dawn' -Your tea, sir. 'So close, so close does the shadow stand' 'If you trust in you and walk ahead, the unseen path will unfold' Good morning, sir. -Good morning. Chandru. The case will be dismissed today. Don't worry. Item number one. HCP: 711/1995. Counsel for petitioner, Chandru vs. Advocate General. Come along, sir. He's here, sir. Please come. You may start, Mr. Chandru. I have a new witness to examine, My Lords. I too learnt of him only yesterday. Permission granted. Salutations, sir. He is Mr. Rajesh. He runs a phone booth in Munnar. Irutappan had called the rice mill owner from his booth. Great going, then! Many thanks to counsel for his efforts in finding a witness for the prosecution! Hold on, sir. Let the witness speak. By all means. Estate workers come to my shop to make phone calls. The phone booth is busy all the time. In a space where one person should stand, three were standing. That caught my attention. Who are they? What's this? The nerve of these people. They've had it! Hello? Hello? Hold up. -Come on out. What's this? Come along. We're with the Tamil Nadu Police. He's an officer. You proceed, sir. -So what? What's the problem? He's speaking on an important case and you're making a scene here. Come along. We'll sort this. What nonsense... Can you identify them? This witness does not seem credible, My Lords! Weren't you just thanking me for producing this witness? I wish to examine Sub-Inspector Guru, My Lords. Permission granted. Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy. Were you in that phone booth? Your silence will be taken as affirmation. Open your mouth and respond, Mister! Sir... We got word that the three men who escaped in a Kerala bound lorry, were in Munnar. We went looking for them, but could not find them. The pressure was mounting from complainant Kathirvel's side. The Communist party also escalated this by taking it to the Superintendent. The higher-ups couldn't stand the heat. So, passing off as Irutappan... ...we made that phone call. Useless fellow. The cops have repeatedly foul played this case, My Lords. This case is nothing but a scandal! The local cops must no longer handle it! It must be handed over to the CBI! Aren't the cops admitting the truth? -One truth to hide many others! We want a CBI inquiry, My Lords! Do you not trust even a single officer in the Tamil Nadu Police, Mr. Chandru? How many CBI investigations have led to conviction of the guilty? We named Tamil Nadu cop Lethika Saran to handle the Chidambaram Padmini case. Didn't her thorough investigation lead to the imprisonment of guilty cops? Similar to that, you suggest a name. We'll appoint them as the Investigating Officer. He has suggested a cop in the rank of IG. I don't think the state will object. We pass order for Inspector General Perumalsamy to investigate this case. You may oversee the investigation, Mr. Chandru. The report must be submitted in 30 days. Please communicate this order to IG Perumalsamy. Thank you, My Lords. Yes, My Lords. This case is escalating day by day. The opposition party is giving interviews about deteriorating law and order. How will I answer the Chief Minister? I can't make any sense of this. This case needs to be closed soon. The CM has ticked my name for a seat in the Parliament too. But, if I lose this case... All my efforts so far would have been in vain. The Home Secretary is very concerned about this case. You know how law and order is. -I do. The CM is very sensitive about it. So, we can't do anything on a whim. The department must not be tainted. This guy is a bothersome lawyer, Perumalsamy. Handle him carefully. -Yes, sir. Welcome, Chandru. A cop who considers lawyers to be the worst people on earth... ...and a lawyer who considers the same about cops are working a case together. Strange, isn't it? I've been meaning to talk to you anyway. Good you came. You are against police torture, right? We don't like it either. Only if cops go to that extreme, do thieves confess. What are we supposed to do? To put an end to crime, we cannot always abide by the law, Chandru. I'll give you a personal example. A school girl wrote to me. A local thug was molesting her every day. If she told her family, she was afraid they'd pull her out of school. No one else could know about it. No complaint registered. No FIR filed. What legal action do I take? So, I went with my conscience. I broke every one of that ruffian's ten fingers. As long as he lives, he can't touch even his wife. I know I was wrong according to the law. But, why must I wear this uniform if I can't even keep a schoolgirl safe? In order to uphold democracy... ...there will be times one must be authoritarian. That's the truth. Take a good look at this case file. You'll see how much nastier cops behaved, when compared to that ruffian. I look forward to see how you uphold your democracy. And... I have a request. You must meet a few people before you start this investigation. Okay. Thank you. Officials have come to listen to how cops frame false cases against you. Without any fear, tell them everything. You can be seated. Please remain seated. Sir... Against my father... Against my husband... Now, against my son, false cases are going on. On my way back from a hunt at night, I saw come cops. I greeted them with folded hands. Claiming I no longer feared them as I dared to greet them... ...they put a theft case on me and had me jailed for three years. I was walking down the road. Cops were standing ahead of me. Wanting no trouble, I kept to the other side. Noticing that, they claimed I was trying to get away from the police... ...and charged me with motorcycle theft. I can't even ride a bicycle! They took me to the forest and strung me up by the thumbs like this... ...stuck a rod in the back of my neck and beat me half to death! I still didn't admit to any wrongdoing. I'm afraid to even think about it! -My husband... He even bore the pain, sir. They brought me to the station and did horrible things. Unable to bear it, my husband admitted to the crime. Does anyone else wish to speak? When they couldn't find my father, the cops took me in and beat me up. Since then, even if an eraser goes missing at school... ...the first thing which is checked is my bag. Fearing that shame, I don't even go to school. Stop crying and boldly tell us what happened. Good morning, sir. He is Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy. -Sir. Stay here. This earring was all that was recovered from the loot. What we spent serving coffee, tea and food to investigating officers... ...has only given back a big, fat zero. Your name? -Kirubakaran. A Constable at the Athiyur station. I don't know how I forgot to lock up the cell that day. I just resumed duty following a suspension. The three of us were handling security at the local minister's meeting that day. We were on night patrol that day. I went to buy dinner for the Head Constable that day. I covered the day shift. I wasn't at the station that night. Was Rajakannu involved in the theft? I don't know, sir. But, Rajakannu was well aware there was cash and jewellery in that closet... ...and that Kathirvel was out of town. Is it true Pachaiamma was harassed? Well... Sir... I have a conscience, sir. Don't do it, sir. She's my aunt. -Back off! Go on! A man, he claims to be! What's going on here? Take your clothes and wait outside! What's going on there? -Hey! This guy's out of control and you just sit back and watch? Do you have no conscience? Why are you supporting those thieves? If there were to be a mishap, we would all be in soup! Remember that! -Okay then. Go! We'll deal with it when it comes! You're not even human. Here. Go home. If that had gone on, she may have even committed suicide! You may go. -Thank you, sir. Boldly tell the IG the truth. He'll never let down his fellow cops. I'm a cop too. I've said the same line to many others. The victim of the theft filed a complaint naming Rajakannu as their suspect. No matter how much we beat him, he didn't confess. How else could we get the truth out? You look for the truth by pulling down a woman's skirt? Natraj. -Sir? Send a team to Kerala to investigate. -Yes, sir. Check every place there, where Irulas work. -Yes, sir. Get out! Salute, sir! -Idiots... At ease! Inquiry statements from the Athiyur station. Here are the videos of it. -Okay. The IG told me to give it to you. -Yeah. What is your perception of this case, Natraj? Could all three of them have escaped? It's a tiny station, sir. Night time too. Only four cops were present. Two of whom were asleep. So, chances are high the three of them did escape. Out of fear, the SI made a lot of mistakes. Besides, it's quite common for many in their caste to be convicted in theft cases. Is any caste devoid of thieves, Natraj? In yours, in mine... there are thieves in every caste! First, stop branding people based on their caste. Sorry. I didn't mean it that way. It's okay. Tell the IG I'll talk to him after going over this. Okay, sir. We scoured Kerala and every place where the Irulas work. Not a clue. -Sir! I don't think they're roaming free. Didn't they escape in a lorry? Could they have been caught at a checkpost? No, sir. We notified every police station in the district. If they were arrested, we'd be told of it. Would you be told of an arrest made on false charges too? I'm sorry, sir. Not every cop is a bad person. Not every cop is a good person either. Natraj... We look into the wrongdoings of criminals. He looks into the wrongdoings of cops. Listen up. Collect FIRs from that week from every station. Track down every jail, sub-jail and special jail in the district. Yes, sir. Come on in! Stand in line! Hello? The kids are ready to be picked up from coaching. Send the jeep. You'll never change, will you? Got a flashlight? Bring it over. Thank you. Dhanashekar... -Sir? Any more police stations in the surrounding area? Yes, there is. But this is the last one inside the Tamil Nadu border. The next station falls under Pondicherry limits. Good morning, sir. Many files are missing serial numbers. Some of them don't even carry photos. -Sir... Lot of rat trouble at the station, sir. We dispose the bitten pages ourselves, as higher-ups would blast us otherwise. Rats will nibble it, bit by bit. Why not give it to donkeys? They'll finish it clean. Sure, sir. Anything serious? I'm not sure... He's here. This is Subramani. The VAO. He reached the scene first. -Yes, sir. Have a seat. -Yes, sir. All set? -Yes, sir. As soon as I heard, I sent my men over early, to secure it. There was nothing here during patrol at 10 PM. Someone did a hit and run accident after that. Even a lorry had gone past. Only below the knees comes under the Tamil Nadu border. Three-fourths of the body is in your station's limits. You need to take charge of the body. Couldn't he have died four feet further away? Consider our plight guarding a dead body all night with a torch! Yet, you are mocking us. Your job ends with laying limits to the corpse. Who's the victim? Was it an accident or murder? If murder, what's the motive? Before this wraps up, we'd be knocked out. If no one claims the body, we'll have to turn undertaker too! Load that in. Till the end, we didn't know who the victim was, sir. Are the forensics here? -They're on the way. Remain seated. The forensic officer from Pondicherry. -Hello, sir. Have a seat. Fingerprints, footprints, body findings. All the fingerprints and impressions found at the scene are in here. Are there any pictures from the scene? -Yes, sir. All photos from every hit and run case of that month. Why on earth are you printing my hand on this, dearie? This will be the first brick in the house we build, dear. My dear! My dear! My dear! You people! When will you tell me the news of my husband's death? Tell us that too! It'll do you a lot of good! Why torment us so? Is there no one to question this? You left before you could even see your son's face! Playing the cop game with me too, eh? -Nothing like that, sir. No one from the government will represent you anymore! We hid the truth out of fear, sir. Only you can save us in this case. Whatever it takes, we are ready! First, tell me what the hell happened! Sir, I... The pressure was mounting from the higher-ups to close this case. Confess! You'll be beaten to death! -I don't know anything, sir! Confess! Won't you bloody confess? I'll beat you to death! Confess! Won't you confess? Where are the jewels? Shut up! Make a sound and I'll kill you! Tell me where the jewels are! I didn't steal anything, sir! Will you confess? No matter how much we beat him, Rajakannu didn't break. Our bad time... Everything went wrong. Hey! Get up! Rajakannu is dead, sir. No one at the station knows. I'm an utter mess! Don't panic! Don't panic. Do what I say. Alright, sir. Sekar! Sentry Sekar! Always dozing off! Get us two meals! Hurry up. Get up, you two! -Sir? Why didn't you lock the cell? Those three escaped! What are you saying? -Are you deaf? I said they escaped! Don't just stand there! Find them! -Yes, sir! Three suspects escaped from their cell. Let me know if you hear anything, sir. You followed my instructions, right? -Yes, sir. Clean this up. -Yes, sir. Why the hell weren't you watching them? Where's your uniform? Sir, I... Be ready to face the SP's fire! If those three aren't found by dawn, you're all finished! Whenever you're asked to testify, you come. Got it? Anyone asks, one of them had a tattoo of a flower on his hand. Stick to it! Sir... What are we going to do with the other two? I'll tell you. Lift it down, Kiruba. -Yes, sir. Hold tight. Get back in! No corpse. No eyewitnesses. This can't be proved as a lock-up death. Under pressure from the SP, you beat them. They escaped. Stick to that story. -Yes, sir. Until the case is over, lie low. Understood. The accident happened when they tried to escape from the Athiyur police station. Rajakannu died in the accident. This is the report from the Pondicherry police. The cops are looking for the other two. It is my humble request this petition to be dismissed, My Lords. An innocent man was beaten to death in custody and thrown out on the street! We don't know if the other two are still alive. How can this be over? How do you call him innocent? There's proof he pawned the stolen jewels. Irutappan and Mosakutty went underground with the stolen money! The only innocent party here are the police! I'd like to question the 'innocent' cop Veerasamy. My Lords... Following that, I humbly request the Honourable Court to decide. Okay. Proceed. Do you maintain a general diary to record daily activities at the station? We do, sir. You've written that they escaped at 9:50 PM. Is that correct? That is correct. When did you inform SI Gurumurthy, the station in-charge, about it? Those of us on duty tried looking for them for a while. We did not find them. Then... at about 10:10... I called the Sub-Inspector and told him what happened. My Lords... I'd like to bring to the notice of this court something very important. There is an entry in the general diary of the escape at 9:50 PM. Here's the outgoing call record list of the station on the day in question. According to it, a call was made to Guru's residence at 9:10 PM. More importantly... After 9:50 PM... ...no further calls were made to Guru from the station. That's why Chandru is a brilliant lawyer. He already had these records. He always waits for the right time. Of the three, Rajakannu is dead. We don't know what became of Mosakutty and Irutappan. No one cares about it, either. Those two are the only witnesses to the truth. Beyond words of support to justice... ...the court's silence towards injustice is more dangerous. We need more time to investigate, My Lords. Having indulged him so far, we can give him another ten days. Should be fine. Next hearing in ten days. -Thank You, My Lords. Have Chandru meet me in my chamber. Even if a judge calls, he won't go to meet them in their chamber, sir. Tea for Sir, comrade. -No, thanks. What are you going to achieve in ten days, Chandru? I'll get that woman a fair settlement. That's the only good thing you can do for your client. I didn't take up this case to achieve anything. I'm fighting for justice for an innocent tribal woman. For Sengani today, for another tomorrow! If denied justice here, I'll take to the streets! The law is a weapon for my fight. That's all! I won't spare anyone who's responsible for Rajakannu's death. Best of Luck. -Back at you! Chandru won't listen to reason. Try brokering a compromise. Or else, it's trouble for you! -Sure, sir. Let me try. A seat in the Parliament is all the AG cares about. The DGP doesn't want the department to be tarnished. The Sub-Inspector has money, caste base and local support backing him up. They will go to any extreme. Criminals have caste, money, and power backing them up. But the victims? We are all they have. Let's go to any extreme too. Do not trample! Do not trample upon tribals! We will not rest! We will not rest until we get justice! Here. We couldn't stop the injustice done to Rajakannu. To make sure another does not suffer his fate, we must fight. (We demand justice) We demand justice! For Rajakannu's death... ...we demand justice! For the tribals... ...we demand justice! Do not do it! Do not foist false cases! Do not do it! Do not foist false cases! Down with brutality! Arrest them! Arrest the cops! This case is dragging our department through the mud. Yes, sir. We can negotiate an out-of-court settlement for the affected family. Handle it. -I'm sorry. I can't broker a compromise. Put this aside for the department's sake, Perumalsamy. I can put aside anything for the department. But I will never put aside my conscience. I'm sorry. The dead man is not going to come back to life. There is no evidence to prove he died in custody. Those cops will be acquitted. In the end, only the department will be humiliated. Why do you deny that poor family the money they will receive? If you can't do it, I'll do it myself. Okay, sir. The forensic report from Kathirvel's house. Bring me the details of the pawn broker. -Yes, sir. (in Hindi) I've already told them everything, sir. But, they... Why are you hitting me? Speak in Tamil. Speak up! -Alright. They were guys I know from my area... "Sir..." "We got word the three men who escaped in a Kerala bound lorry, were in Munnar." "We went looking for them, but could not find them." "In order to cool things down..." "...passing off as Irutappan..." "...we called the rice mill owner ourselves." "In order to cool things down..." "...passing off as Irutappan, we called the rice mill owner ourselves." He's been working for me for over ten years. Won't I know his voice? In a space where one person should stand, three were standing. That caught my attention. Hello? -Natraj? Go ahead, sir. I need a record of SI Guru's service history. Okay, sir. -Immediately. According to Mythra, Iruttapan cannot read numbers. But the rice mill owner was sure it was Irutappan who called him. Rajesh of Munnar said there were three people in the booth. But writer Veerasamy... ...spoke to Rajesh outside of the phone booth. If we can connect the dots... ...it was Irutappan on the phone. But it was the police who forced him to make that call. Guru served in Udumalaipet for three years? -Yes, sir. That phone booth is eighty kilometres from the Udumalaipet police station. Guru still has good rapport with his old station. We were right in searching in the jails. We were just looking in the wrong ones. That doctor over there, sir. -Thank you. I just need a minute, doctor. Please wait. -Sure. Bring them over. You stated the cause of death was a broken rib piercing the heart. That could be caused by the cops kicking and stomping, right? Quite possible. But I can't say for certain. Being run over by a vehicle could've also caused it. I'm not sure. No, doctor, I... Can you confirm Rajakannu's time of death? -That's difficult. We cannot be that precise. Doctor... Doctor, please. I need at least one evidence to prove Rajakannu died in police custody. You may have missed something. Think hard. You won't win this case. There's proof Rajakannu was killed in a road accident. If you're fine with it... ...I'll talk to those cops and get you the money you need. You'll need it for your children's future. You need to decide. To the baby on the way... ...there is no father I can show. But I'll have lots of money! That is what will feed my children. If they ask me how I got the money for food... "It was given by the same people who beat your father to death." "That's how we survive!" Should I tell them that, sir? There's no one that cares when we get killed. But we won't live on alms from the killers! I don't care if I lose this case. I'll tell my children we went down fighting. If you can... ...punish those murderous cops. Please think it over... Everyone stand in line! Come on! Hands down! Stand in line! Move aside. Step up front! Mosakutty? Teacher ma'am! Where's Irutappan? Isn't he with you? Irutappan is in this prison too, sir! Is my brother well, teacher ma'am? My work is all about details. Do not question my experience! In my capacity, I cannot conclude Rajakannu's death is a murder. Sorry, Mr. Chandru. It's okay. We just need to get through tomorrow. The judge panel changes after that. If Mosakutty and Irutappan don't make it to court tomorrow... ...the hearing can be postponed. Neither of them were there, sir. Your department men have moved their families somewhere. What do we do now? They're at the full security camp house, sir. The IG is there too. I hear Sengani alone is staying at the lawyer's house. With no fear, tell us what happened at the Athiyur police station, Mosakutty. Sir... The Sub-Inspector tortured us to confess to the theft. Don't know, eh? -I don't know, sir! Don't know, do you? -I don't know, sir! Tell them not to hurt him, sir! As long as you don't confess, he'll get beaten! Where have you hidden the stolen jewels and cash? Get over here! They kept beating Uncle Rajakannu to make him confess! I did not steal, sir. Hold it firm! I did not steal, sir! I didn't, sir! How many times do I tell you to confess? Confess to the theft! Won't you bloody confess? -I did not steal! Won't you confess? Should I beg to you? -I did not steal! I'll beat you to death! Confess! Where are the jewels? Hold it tightly! My brother did nothing wrong, sir! -Will you confess? Confess! Bloody confess to the theft! Confess! How long I've been asking? Confess to the theft! -Let my brother go, sir! Confess! Won't you bloody confess? Must I beg to you? Stop hitting him, sir! -Let go of my leg! You dare touch my leg? You dare touch me? Here you go, sir. -What do I tell the SP? He won't confess no matter how much I beat him! I... ...didn't steal, sir. I didn't steal, sir. I didn't steal... Bloody die! He stomped my uncle right in his chest. He coughed up hard and fainted. Irutappan... ...wasn't stirring at all... Get up! Irutappa... Uncle... I tried waking them up... Neither of them opened their eyes. What happened next? They said my uncle had escaped. They beat us up. After that, they threw us in jail in some other town. When did you come to learn of Rajakannu's death? When the teacher told us day before yesterday. That's all, My Lords. Neither Irutappan nor Mosakutty witnessed Rajakannu's death. Pretending to be unconscious... ...when the police were in panic, Rajakannu escaped. On the way, he died in an accident. So, this cannot be portrayed as a case of lock-up death! The witness is not done with his testimony. Sir... Sir! What is it? Both of them haven't woken up for a long time! Please come quickly and take a look! Sir... What the hell is it? -They're not waking up. They are both not waking up... -Shut up! Sit down, I say! Wake up, you! Hey! Wake up! Wake the hell up! Wake up, I say! If you make a single sound, you are done for! Kiruba! -Yes, Constable sir? Get inside! -Sir! What happened, sir? -Get some chilli powder. It burns! It burns! -Lift him up! It burns! -Get up! Keep quiet! Pour some! -Here. Pour more! Beat him... Take him to that room. -Come along! Go! It burns like hell! -Get down... Sit down! Shut up or I'll kill you! Make a sound and you're done for! Stay quiet! -It burns... I couldn't even open my eyes, sir. They locked up Mosakutty and me in a room. My brother was unconscious. The autopsy report says the cause of death as a broken rib that pierced the heart. Because SI Guru repeatedly stomped on Rajakannu's chest... ...the latter died, when inside the jail. It's a clear cut case of murder in lock-up by the police. My Lords, I'd like to call the doctor to throw some clarity on this. Doctor... If I'm not wrong, the accident could've broken Rajakannu's rib, right? It might have. My Lords... The counsel is tactful in changing a Habeas Corpus petition... ...into a murder trial. But on examining Rajakannu's body... ...I found some kind of powder on his face and facial hair. Suspecting it was poison, I sent it to the lab. It tested negative. It was not poison. It was chilli powder. Hey... wake up. Rajakannu! Kiruba! How could someone travel this far with chilli powder in their eyes? Had he been alive when the powder was sprinkled... ...there would've been a severe reaction. There was no reaction in the corpse's eyes. My Lords... If there are doubts in Rajakannu's death, the High Court need not hear it. Transfer the trial to a Criminal Court! This is no police station border to shrug off our responsibility! This is the High Court. Don't you forget it! Like the narrative that tribals are innocent... ...we brand the police as suspects! This is not fair! So you don't know who the criminals are? You're about to find out. My Lords, I wish to examine Investigating Officer Perumalsamy. Sir! This case began with the theft at Kathirvel's house. Two sets of fingerprints were found at the crime scene. One belonged to Rajakannu, who went there to catch a snake. The other belonged to Ravi. The actual thief. Guys I know from my area, sir. They visited me. They offered me a great deal. I bought it for a low price. Lured by money, I went along with it. It's the house of a ruling party member. I need to show recovery. Return some of the stolen jewels. Right, Constable sir? -Indeed. What say? -Alright, sir. Despite knowing who stole it, the cops took a bribe from the guilty... ...and made a scapegoat out of the innocent Irulas. My Lords! Does the counsel have evidence to establish Rajakannu was killed in custody? That's my question! -We do, sir! Tyre marks of a van were found next to the body of Rajakannu. Along with shoe prints of two people. It matched with the van used by the Athiyur police. The shoe prints at the crime scene... ...matched those of SI Guru and Constable Kiruba. I am ashamed to say... ...Rajakannu was murdered in lock-up by the police. The cops themselves dumped the body at the Pondicherry border. My investigation report contains the entire details of the incident. Thank you, Mr. Perumalsamy. -Yes, sir! Since the AG has the right to pre-audience, he's permitted to rest the case first. My Lords... From the start, the inquiry has been driven by the narrative that 'police are guilty'. The court can give any punishment for harassing the victim illegally. I deeply regret the pain and agony the victims have gone through. But all are equal in the eyes of the law! So, I request a free and fair trial in a Criminal Court. Just because the police assaulted, it shouldn't be converted as a case of murder. The law permits them to demand a fair trial. That's my humble request, My Lords. My Lords... Irulas don't have a place even in a village map. Skilled bowmen, who go back centuries, they live as bonded labourers now. They are treated like address-less orphans. Is this a High Court or a history class, Mr. Chandru? I don't understand! It's not knowing history that led to... ...such cruelty towards the native tribes of the Tamil land! Sengani and her family work as bonded labourers for a paltry amount. They tried to dupe her with lakhs. She said, "I don't want your money." "I want justice for my husband's death." This Court must not betray Sengani's faith in the law of the land. To those of you unaware of history... Sengani, who demands justice for her husband who was beaten to death... ...is today's incarnation of the epic heroine Kannagi! The petition filed by this destitute woman is the modern 'Silapathikaaram'! Like then, are we going to deny justice now or not, is what the court should decide. My Lords! The guilty must be severely punished. The affected must be duly compensated. As a gesture of upholding the rights of Irulas... ...who have been denied even a pinch of land for generations... I ask a land grant be provided to Sengani inside the town. This is no ordinary case of custodial murder. It is a tribal woman's rousing question as to why no one stands up for them... ...when arrogant authorities brutalize them! So asks, her Habeas Corpus petition. What the court will give is no mere judgment. It is hope. That's all, My Lords. The verdict in this case will be given shortly. So much for the seat in Parliament. I don't know what the verdict will be. But I have total satisfaction that I acted according to the law and conscience. Thank you. Without any justification... ...Rajakannu and his family were illegally arrested and tortured. We order the trial for Rajakannu's murder. We name SI Gurumurthy, HC Veerasamy and Constable Kirubakaran as the accused. They have to be arrested immediately. We order a compensation of 3 lakhs to Sengani and 2 lakhs each... ...to Mosakutty, Irutappan and Pachaiamma, to be paid by the State. That apart, Sengani must be given half-a-ground land grant... ...in a central place in the village. If the police and the judiciary work together... ...the rights of the people will be upheld. This case is a clear illustration of that. We record our appreciation for the team headed by the IG... ...in redeeming the image lost by the police before this court. For taking all effort to obtain justice for a tribal woman... ...this court heartily commends advocate Chandru. It is inhuman and against the law for the police to foist false cases. The subordinate courts should not be party to jailing innocents. This court strongly recommends that custodial torture,... ...a violation of human rights, must be put an end to. 'Even in a rocky field, there is moisture' 'Even in a thorny jungle, there are flowers' 'If you trust, there will be another tomorrow' 'To hold you up, there will be another soul' 'Wherever you may go, the golden sky will be by you' 'There are no limits... Come... Time is ours' 'Even in a rocky field, there is moisture' 'Even in a thorny jungle, there are flowers' (...Rajakannu case) 'Finding your self-confidence marks your standing in this world' 'If thoughts become action, all you seek will come on its own' 'Walking in the path of truth is your life's only purpose' 'Hoisting the flag of love, a million hands will rise in support' 'Can there be a life without a quest?' 'Everything is within you... Seek it out, my dear' (Rajakannu House) At Cuddalore Kammapuram police station, Rajakannu was beaten to death. Cops claimed he escaped from prison. The Habeas Corpus filed by Rajakannu's wife Parvathi... ...was momentous in Chennai High Court history. 'Palangudi Irular Pathugaappu Sangam' was launched in 1996. The union has handled over 1,000 cases for the Irulas. The Irulas, a downtrodden minority, are unable to procure land grants... ...and are jailed on false charges even today. Chandru stood for freedom of expression in cases opposing MISA, TADA and POTA acts. He has not charged a single rupee for any human rights case he handled. He presided over 96,000 cases in six years and delivered historic judgments. He passed verdicts to ensure Panchami lands are given only to Dalits... ...and abolished segregation in burial grounds for lower castes. "To understand the cases I handled as a lawyer and judge..." "...the writings and words of Dr. Ambedkar greatly helped me." ~ Justice Chandru "Jai Bhim is light. Jai Bhim is love. Jai Bhim is a path from darkness to light." "Jai Bhim is the tear drop of millions of people!" ~ Marathi poet
