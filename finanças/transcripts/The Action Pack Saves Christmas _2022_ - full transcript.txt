Look at all these presents! Nothing's better than a grizzly-bear-big stack of presents with your name on 'em. Hot Sparks! Is this one for me? Yeppers. I had so much fun making Hanukkah presents when we celebrated with you, Watts, that I made Christmas presents for everyone too. Ooh, holidays make me hamster-hedgehog-hummingbird happy! Can I open it? Nuh-uh, Watts. It's Hope Springs' Christmas tradition that you don't open gifts until the gift exchange at the tree lighting ceremony. Right. Presents happen after I help light up the tree! Zip, zip, zip! Zap! - Watts! - The crowd cheers! They chant my name! - That's me. Thank you. - Watts! - Watts! - Oh. Yes? Light the tree, not the teacher. Oops! Sorry, Mr. Ernesto. Wow, Action Pack! Mission Decorate The Action Academy is complete. Hoodies down, team. You kids are clear to go to the tree lighting. Grab your gifts for the exchange, and I'll be there as soon as my cookies are done. - Yeah! - Woo-hoo! ♪ Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way… ♪ Everybody loves winter! ♪ Making spirits bright What fun it is to… ♪ It's too early for Christmas music! Oh, Mr. Grumpman, it's Christmas Eve! Oh, fiddlesticks! ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride… ♪ Ah, Matthew. As my first toy, you understand that being the child of the Von Taker toy tycoons means I get every toy made in Hope Springs. But I, Teddy Von Taker, need more toys! Toys not built in Hope Springs. And to take them, I need more power. That's where my Christmas Cheer-Taker comes in. Once I get the Christmas cheer, I'll be ready for Santa tonight. It's a flurry of fun! There's a kid with Christmas cheer! Shall we, Matthew? Time to take the cheer away. Yeah! Winter! - Whatever. - Whatever. - Whatever. - Eh, it's just snow. It's working! More cheer for me, less cheer for everyone else! ♪ Jingle bells… ♪ I'll be taking your cheer too. ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh, hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ - Oh, hot dog. - Let's go. I don't really feel like singin'. Finally! I can enjoy Christmas in peace. Hm. Why isn't my Cheer-Taker working? You think you're just gonna suck out all the cheer to power up that battery thingamajig? Well, I don't have any cheer to take! I say the joke is on you, sir. You have a little cheer in there after all. Oh, fiddlesticks. More cheer, more power for me! And then, one Christmas, I got an art kit, and it had paint and glitter and... Huh? Why are they leaving? This Christmas party isn't looking like a party at all. Let's see what's going on. - What's wrong, Cold Snap? - I don't feel like celebrating. Goodbye. What? I thought Cold Snap would love Christmas. Maybe he celebrates something else? Well, Hanukkah's all about being with your family, and kindness, and giving too. All of those things make me happy, so I don't think that's it. Something strange is going on here. This place should be bubbling with Christmas cheer. Did someone say Christmas cheer? Teddy Von Taker?! Why, hello, Action Pack. You have just the cheer I'm here to take, take, take. Wonderful! The Toy Tycoon Multi-Purpose Gauntlet is quite handy. Take our cheer? What does he mean? I don't know. But we better find out. Action Pack, circle up, hoodies up, and… Take action! ♪ Action Pack ♪ ♪ Here we go ♪ Treena, mighty flowers and plant powers! Clay, Plasma Power and Invinci-ball! Wren, changing up with animal powers. Roar! Watts, supercharged electric zaps! I'm tired of waiting, Action Pack! - Whoa! - So loud! Oh, pardon me. Microphone off. I'm just here to take your cheer. Watch out! Action On! Invinci-ball! Butterfly Wings! Oh, zap! Huh? It's not working! Hey! Taking people's Christmas cheer is not nice! Being all cheery, happy, smiley, and full of feel-good feels is what Christmas is all abou... Wren! Don't worry. I'll stop this. Electric Blast! Fully charged and ready to take, take, take for phase two. Wren! Oh no! I won't even need the cheer from the rest of the Action Pack. Ready, Matthew? Then let's go. - Are you okay? - How do you feel? I'm okay. I just feel… nothing. Oh no! He actually took her Christmas cheer. Why would Teddy do that? Well, Mr. Ernesto did teach us that Christmas cheer is really powerful. Oh, zap! With all Wren's cheer, Teddy Von Taker will be mega-powered! I think we need a plan of action. Treena? You got it. Our mission is to save Christmas. We have to stop Teddy Von Taker from doing whatever he plans to do with that cheer power. Then we need to figure out how to get the cheer out of that battery and back into the people. Then I'll light the tree! That is a plan. Action On! Action On. I guess. Hold it right there, Teddy Von Taker. Bye! Give that cheer back, or I'll… Hot Sparks! Is that really an UltraFly Zoom Board 2.0? Can I try it? Actually, it's the 3.0 version with advanced agility. Bye! Whoa! What? - Gotcha! - Yeah! Release the penguins! Huh? Watch out! Distract those heroes by, uh… Destroying that Christmas tree! Don't hurt the tree! Petal-copter Power! If they destroy the tree, then I won't be able to light it. Penguins. Meh. Wren! Invinci-ball! Huh. Invinci-ball. How unexpected. Petal Flurry! This tree is under our protection. Whoa! Not the presents! Electric Trail! Oh, oh, oh, yeah! - All right! - Way to grow, buds. - No! - Invinci-ball! - What do we do? - There are too many penguins! Do you hear that? - Huh? - What is that? Penguins! You're on my naughty list. Ho! Ho! Super Santa and Striker are here to save Christmas! - Incredible! - Santa Claus is a s-superhero? Santa. That's nice. Action Pack, I brought cookies! Santa?! I know who you are. Ernesto Action, top of the nice list for the past 27 years. Meet my reindeer, Striker. Action Pack, I was delivering presents when I received a red and green alert on the naughty list that Hope Springs' Christmas cheer was taken by Teddy Von Taker. Well, I'm here to get that cheer back. What do you think he's trying to do with the cheer, Santa? Well, I… I don't know. You see, Christmas cheer is usually used for good, helping others, spreading joy, giving. But the raw power of Christmas cheer can also be used for bad. It could power all sorts of villain devices. I have to save Christmas! Um, excuse me, Super Santa, sir. I mean, Mr. Claus. Your mission is our mission too. And we'd love to help. Oh, well, Santa always needs a few little helpers, that's for sure. But first, we must get Wren - feeling like her cheerful self again. - Meh. And to fill her full of Christmas cheer, we'll need her presents. Woo-hoo! Presents! This one's for Wren! And that one! Ho, ho! You misunderstood, Watts. Getting presents is great, but the quickest way to gain Christmas cheer is by giving. Wren, get the present you brought for Clay. Okay, if you say so. For you, Clay. "The Exciting Adventures of Clay." Wow, you made a comic for me? It's my favorite present. Thanks, Wren! And one for Treena. A flower pot! I painted the flowers just for you. Thank you, Wren! - And the last one is for Watts. - Yes, yes, yes! Hot Sparks! You made a drawing of me with Crimson Cape? We look so cool! Can I get a hug, Wren? Abso-toucan-lutely! Group hug! Santa? Santa's here! Are ya ready to save Christmas? 'Cause I am! Hiya, Striker. I want to hear all about being a reindeer. Uh-huh, yeah. Really? Oh! Uh-huh? Wow! I didn't understand a word ya said, 'cause I don't speak reindeer, but I love the way ya snort. - W-What? - Ah, Mr. Ernesto. Welcome back. I'll need you to run Mission Control while we go to Teddy's hideout to wait. Me? Mission Control for you? The big guy in the red suit?! I'd be honored, sir! Come on, Plunky! Action Pack, be smart, be safe, be superheroes! Action On! For Hanukkah, we celebrate eight nights, and we get presents every night. Oh, that sounds amazing, Watts. Lighting the way, you say. That reminds me of someone else. There he is! Ah, see, Matthew? Everything is working out just according to... Teddy Von Taker! Hello, Santa. Isn't it a bit early for you to be in Hope Springs? It is, but he was alerted because of what you did, and now we're here to stop you. I'm taking this cheer and returning it to the people of Hope Springs. Sure, sure. But first, won't you join me for a snack? M-Milk and c-c-cookies? - Milk and cookies! - Santa! No! - It's a trap! - Don't do it! - Santa, stop! - Milk and cookies! The Invinci-ball is breaking! Ah, we'll do it together, old sport. - A force field! - Leapin' lemurs! - No! - We're trapped! Mmm. Huh? What happened? Oh no. Milk and cookies! My only weakness. The Christmas cheer powering this force field is more powerful than even you, my ho-hoing chum, so you can't escape. And now to take, take, take my prize! No! Santa's cape! Everything I ever wanted to take is here. Wow, I guess Teddy really likes capes. He knows. But how? Allow me to explain. I have every toy Hope Springs has to offer. What I don't have is every toy from the North Pole, and I want them all! I tried taking some last year. It was Christmas Eve. I placed my spy in the Action Academy, where those heroes would get their gifts. That's when I saw that the cape was the bag, and that the bag was a portal connected directly to the North Pole Workshop. Santa's Workshop, would you mind getting me a super snuggly snuggle bug for Wren Reyes, please? Any toy that the holder of the bag asked for would appear in the bag. I wasn't able to take it last Christmas because I wasn't powerful enough to trap Santa. That's where the Christmas cheer came in. Now every North Pole toy will be mine! Attention, Santa's Workshop. I'll take a toy car. Yes! It worked! I'll take another car. And another car, and another car, and another! Boy, he really likes cars. I think we're going to need more help than that, Striker. I can help. Action On! Polar Bear! Polar Bear! Oh no! I think the Cheer-Taker messed with my animal powers. Mr. Ernesto will be able to help us. Mr. Ernesto, come in. Treena, what's wrong? Is Santa okay? Can he hear me? Ho, ho. Yes, he can hear you. And no, we're not okay. We're trapped inside a Christmas cheer-powered force field. Oh no! I'm scanning the design through your insignia. And another car! And another! Oh, got it! If it works the way I think it does, the only way to deactivate the force field is to press the red button on the power dock. Maybe I can reach it. Plasma Putty Stretch! It's too far. And I can't quite push it. If I could just change into a tiny mouse, I could fit through. Action On! Tiny Mouse! Wren, you are one of the best gift givers I have ever met. I bet if you think of your powers as a gift you can give to Hope Springs, you'll be able to do it. You're silly, Santa. It's not a gift. There's no way to put it in a pretty box and wrap it. Gifts don't have to be things you can hold in your hands. Some of the best gifts are something you do for someone. Okay. Action On! Tiny Mouse! Tiny Mouse! A gift for Hope Springs. Action On! Tiny Mouse! Huh? It worked! - Plant-tastic! - Hot Sparks! I'll shut off that battery before you can say duck-billed platypus! Oh! Being itty-bitty is mega-biggie dangerous. Where did this bear come from? And I can't go big, or Teddy will see me. Attention, Santa's Workshop. My dear Matthew has requested more bears. Bad car, bad car! Whoa! Good car, good car! - Yeah! - Great job, Wren! Push, push, push! You! Action On! Sneaky Fox! Action On! Cheetah? Action On! Anything? My animal powers aren't working again! And I'm stuck as a mouse! Santa's Workshop! I need something that will take this meddling rodent far away from that button. How about some Taker Tots? Take, take, take, take. Take, take. Wren! Look out! - Take. - Oh no! Take, take, take, take. - Take! - Take! Take! Wren! A gift for Hope Springs! This is my gift for Hope Springs. - Action On! - Take. Polar Bear Arms! Take, take. I did it! A gift for Hope Springs! A gift for Hope Springs! They're going to be so happy and cheerful and have a very merry Christmas! Take! Roar! Take, take. Taker Tots, take them! Take, take, take, take. Action On! Invinci-ball! Take, take. Get the Taker Tots in here! Flower Power! Take? Home run! Take. Strike! Take, take, take. - Take? - Slam dunk! Take. Just let... Take, take, take, take. I'll be taking that, and all the toys you took. - Come along, toys. - No! Not my toys! Take, take, take, take, take. - Take. - Hey, I took those fair and square! Take. That one didn't listen to you, so it's mine. And you can't take it back. Taker Tot, take them. - Take? - No, wait! Huh? Hey! Matthew! It's time to restore Christmas cheer. Nothing like a quiet walk. Hmm. Huh? Wow, look at that. Wow! - Oh! - Hot dog! ♪ Dashing through the snow In a one-horse open sleigh… ♪ No caroling! ♪ O'er the hills we go… ♪ Oh ho, they did it! The Action Pack and Santa returned the Christmas cheer! Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Ernesto. And you too, Plunky. ♪ Fa la la la la, la la la la ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun it is To ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh, what fun… ♪ Thank you for your help. You did a jolly good job. But our mission isn't over yet. Yeah. We'd light up if it was. Well, we only finished the first part of the mission to save Christmas. With all that hullabaloo, I'm behind on my gift deliveries. Action Pack, would you like to help me deliver the gifts? - Yes! - That would be awesome! - I think I'd like that. - I love giving! Mr. Ernesto, can you help us by mapping the fastest route? One step ahead of you. Plunky and I have already planned the perfect delivery route so you can get all the presents out on time. Excellent Mission Controlling, you two. But it's not Christmas until we light the tree. Hot Sparks! That's my cue! - Happy holidays! - Feliz Navidad! Merry Christmas!
