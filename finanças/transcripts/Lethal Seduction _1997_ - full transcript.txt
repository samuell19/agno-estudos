We ready to do business? - Yeah, Karl, I been ready. - What's your hurry? Are you going someplace? - Let me see the boss. - Let me see the green. - Let me see the goods. (chuckles) - What's... What's he doing, what's going on? - He's trying to flush out Gruman. - God damn it, he knows better than that. - Nice, huh? No serial numbers either, man. It's completely untraceable. - Uh uh! Let me talk to the boss first, get him out of the car. - He ain't in the car. - What? - Look man, don't give me shit with details. You wanted the hammers, you got 'em. - That's not what this is! The deal was I meet him on this one. If everything goes alright, I make a big buy next time. You tell your boss when he's ready to show, I'm ready to shop. - No can do, man. A deal's a deal. - Say's who? Says Mr. Smith and Mr. Wesson. - That's it, we're goin' in. - Trent is still in the line of fire. - All units, this is go. Move in! (engines revving) - Then why don't you drop me, right now! You go tell your boss that you wasted his best customer. - Fuck you, man. - Police, freeze! - You fuck. (intense music) (gunshots firing) - You okay? - What the hell happened? You were supposed to wait for my signal. Jesus, I could've had my head blown off! - Yeah, he's okay. (romantic music) (phone ringing) - No, no, no, no, no, no, baby. - Hello? Yes he is, can you say who's calling? It's your uncle. - Hello? - Was that the mysterious girlfriend I'm not supposed to know about? - Maybe. - Well, bring her with ya. I'm here with some of the guys down at Rick's. - Ah, I don't know, she's kinda shy. - Hey come on, think about it. I'm buying. - Oh, you're having a retirement party already. - No. Not yet.

Have you asked your dad yet? - About what? - (chuckles) You know about what. - Ah. Here. I'll talk to him tomorrow. - Thanks. - You know, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were just after the money. - Come on. Yes!

How are you, Mikey guy? Oh. You guys want some action? - No, I don't think so, Terry. - Oh listen man, I got a new one for you. Come here Mindy, come here. Look at this Mindy. 16, fresh meat, man. - Sit down. You better know why I'm here, and if you don't, then you're in deeper shit than I thought. - Hey, I got it, don't worry about it, I got it, I'm sorry, I'm just a little late, I've been really busy man. You know, auditioning girls, getting them ready. Oh, hey, man, tonight I am auditioning a really great one, man. - Oh, lucky girl. - Yeah. You know, Mikey, I've know him since he was in diapers. And your dad and I, you know, we go way back. - You know, the only reason I'm asking for this and not taking it is because you and dad do go way back.

So, you got any plans? - I think I'll hang here with my nephew. - Oh. Okay, see you tomorrow. - Okay.

My nephew's a gigolo. - You know, sometimes I think you're jealous. - What? - Well, face it. You got this retirement thing coming up, and no matter what you do, I'll always be younger than you.

(chuckles) - Off the case? What do you mean I'm off the case? - Do you need an interpreter? - Hey, I am the case. Nearly everything the DA has on Gruman came from me. - You do good work, Jacobson. But that stunt last night blew your cover, and frankly, your judgment's getting a little fuzzy. - Where do you get that? What do you mean? - This is what I mean. You're obsessed with nailing this guy before you retire, and it's starting to trip you up. - My retirement has nothing to do with it, and I'm not screwing up. - Oh, but if you hadn't insisted on seeing Gruman himself last night, you might still have your cover. Am I right? Oh, here. Take this call. - Hey, this is a lousy heart attack, send a uniform. - Jacobson, like the commercial says, just do it.

From now on, nothing goes down unless I give the okay. - It's not as bad as it could've been though. We should have Karl out on bail by this afternoon. - Yeah, it's a small consolation. - Mona wants to talk to you. - Yeah, right. That's all, Mike. Mike... Don't say anything to your sister about this. - I know. - Is he in a good mood? - No. - Hi, Daddy. - What can I do for you, sweetheart? - I wanted to see if you thought anymore about helping Donny out with the studio? - Look, I... I ran a credit check on this young man. - You did what? - Now let your father finish for once in his life. He may seem like a very nice young man, but he's a bad investment. - He just needs a little help until his business picks up. - No, I'm sorry, he... Look, Mona... He's using you. - Fine. You know, I can always take the money out of my trust fund. - You are not going to touch that money! - What if I do, are you gonna have me beaten up? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Alright, alright, alright, you can have a check, anything you want. Okay? - Fine. - [Donny] Are you sure you've never modeled before?

I got something for ya. It's from my dad. - Oh, for the studio. - Tell him thanks for me. - No, you should be thanking Mona. Because if it wasn't for her, you wouldn't be getting anything. - She's really a great girl. - Yeah. And my dad isn't real thrilled about you seeing her. - Yeah, he thinks maybe you're like taking advantage. - I'm sure Mona doesn't feel that way. - Oh, no? How the hell do you think she'd feel if she saw you hitting on that girl a few minutes ago, huh? - Oh, she's a model, it's just business, I'm not trying to hit on her or anything. Business. - Oh, yeah, nice. Nice Donny boy, real professional. Well you keep it just business, cause I'm looking out for my sister, and I know where to find you, you understand? - Yeah. - It's a pleasure to meet ya. - Hey Bernie. - Hey Trent. Aren't you retired yet? What are you doing here? - Ask the LT. What's going on? What's up? - Pretty routine, maid found him this morning. My guess is he went sometime past midnight. Wallet ID's him as a Terry White. Runs a cat house on the south side. - He by himself? - Well, he's the only one on the register, but the man at the front desk saw some brunette in his car. Wanna hear my theory? - Yeah, okay. What's up? - Well, girl's a hooker. They come back to their room, a little of this, a little of that, and in the heat of the battle, his heart gives out. The girl gets spooked and leaves. - He died in the saddle, huh? - Yeah, sure. Happens to lots of guys. Nelson Rockefeller. - No kidding? - Yeah. After a guy hits 40, his heart doesn't have the stamina anymore. - What do you mean when a guy hits 40? - Oh, medical fact. Something you should think about. (speaking in foreign language) (loud band music) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Have you ever done any modeling? - Save it for someone who's not married. - Or isn't with somebody. - Photographer, huh? - Yeah, you ever done any modeling? - Sometimes. It depends. - Depends? - On who's taking the pictures. - I'm Donny Jacobson. - I know. I'm Holly, nice to meet you. What you drinkin' there? - Rum and Coke. - Mm. Mind if I have a taste? - Sure. - Needs more rum. - Oh. - So, Donny... Would you like to take my picture? - Sure. - Well, let's find us a place that makes a decent Rum and Coke and we can discuss it. - Okay. Why don't you go on ahead, and I'll follow you. - I see. You don't want to be seen with me. - No, it's not that, I just have a little problem with a friend. - Shh. I understand. I'll be waiting. (loud band music) - So, you want something else to drink? Some rum, or vodka, or some... - No. I still have a good buzz going through me from before. (chuckling) So where's this camera of yours, huh? - Camera? Oh, yeah. Hold on. Camera. Don't worry. A good photographer always knows where his camera... Found it. Hello? Holly? Hello, Holly? - I'll be up here. Well? - I see you've done this before. - I've done lots of things before. Are you sure you can focus? - I'm a professional. - Oh, okay. - Okay, hold still. Here we go. - What are you waiting for? Does that thing have a timer? - What? What do you mean? - [Holly] I mean, do you have to stay on that side of the camera the whole time? - Now it'll take a shot once every minute. - Good.

I mean, that was my fuck up, I'm sorry. - Sorry? Did you say sorry? Sorry is when you bump into somebody, sorry is when you spill a drink. But when you lost a couple of thousand dollars in hardware, and a couple of your guys get whacked, sorry doesn't cut it, Karl. - Man, it was a fuck up, I'm sorry.

(engine revs) - Bye. - I'll see you tomorrow? - If you're lucky. (chuckles) - Well hello, gorgeous. (shutter clicks) - [Man With Ponytail] Hey Trent. - Morning, Trent. - Bernie. - Looks like a tough week for middle-aged men, huh? - What do we have? - Same thing as the guy last Tuesday. Looks like he's been here all night. - He was naked? - Yeah, they found his clothes on the floorboard. - Think he was flying solo? - He doesn't strike me as the kind of guy that would drive all the way out here to sit in his car naked and then die from a heart attack. - Weirder things have been known to happen. - Yeah. Well like I told you, men over 40, bad heart... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Who was he? - Clay Schertz. - Run it through RNI. Send it up to me when you have something. - Where you going? - To see if I have a witness. Hey, wake up! Let's go, come on, time to get up. - No, no more basketball. - Hey, I'm not here for basketball. Jesus, Donny, it's almost noon, what are you doing still in bed? - Some of us have a social life, okay? - Yeah. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You go to the lake yesterday? - Yeah. - You see anything last night? - No, we left before sundown. - You sure, there was nothing out of the ordinary? - No, and I was looking too. - What do you mean? - Well, I didn't want my other girlfriend to find out about Holly. - Conscience catching up with you, huh? - No. But I think Holly likes to do it in weird places. It's like it turns her on to be out in the open. - Dangerous when you're two timing. - So, what happened at the lake? - Hm, found another stiff this morning. Hey, since you're up anyway, you want to go shoot some hoops? - What is it with you recently? Did you have an extra cup of coffee this morning? - I don't know, ever since I quit smoking, you know, I just have all this energy. - Great. Why don't you go practice so I don't have to spot you points next time? (loud banging) - Will you listen to me? Come on, give me a break. Will you stop? Will you just stop and look at this for a second? What do these two men have in common? - They're both dead. - Well, what else? Hey, besides being freshly dead, both of these men back when they were more animated, had business dealings with none other than one Gus Gruman. - Oh... - Hey, it's true! It's true, it's in the case files, it's verifiable. - Jacobson. I gave you these piece of shit homicide details to get you away from Gruman. - But this could be our opening. This is something we can finally nail him on. - Jacobson, read the fine print. These guys are heart attacks, natural causes, not murder. - Ah, you're not buying that coincidence stuff, are ya? - I'm buying the coroner's report. - What if I can get the coroner to change the report? - If you can get the coroner to say that both of these guys were foul play, not one of them, but both of them, then you can bring Gruman in for questioning, and that's it. - Yes! - Missed again, Jacobson. - Yeah. But I'm getting closer. You gotta come through for me on this one, Chuck, Jimmy already made a ruling. - You know, Jimmy's a smart kid, but he watches too many reruns of Quincy, tends to miss details. - You've got fun clientele. - Yeah. You know, these guys have all the answers. I mean, they can tell us how they got here. Did he slip in the shower, or was there rat poison in his coffee? Was there a fight, was there a struggle? They can tell us everything. You know how? I speak their language. - Could we move this along, please? - Sure. You quit smoking, Trent? - Yeah, three days now. - Thought so. You seem nervous. Let's see what we got here. Two males, Caucasian, both early 40s, official cause heart attacks. - You confirm that? - Maybe. Except for one thing... See this? And this, see? Same thing. - What is it? - Did either of these guys have connection to organized crime? - Ask them. - Friend of mine in Chicago, he told me about this. Apparently it's all the rage up there, with the wiseguys. - Okay, so what is it, a drug? - It's air, Trent. It's nothing but air. You get yourself a big cardiac needle like this one, right? You pump about 20 cc's of air directly into the guy's ticker, screws up the mechanism enough to make it sputter and stop. - Is that what happened to these guys? - See, that's the beauty of it. No way to tell for sure. Eh, one thing is you gotta get really, really close in order to do it. I mean, it's not like taking a gun and whacking someone from across the street. - So the killer was someone they knew. - Maybe. Who else would you let get really, really close to you, Trent? - A woman. Evidence indicates that these two were probably in the act when they were iced. - Well the odds, you're looking for a female. - You'll amend the report? - Sure, no problem. - Thanks, Chuck. I owe you lunch. We'll eat out. (ominous music) - Hey. - Oh. - Forget about me? - No. - I mean, you could've at least called and thanked me for keeping you out of the poorhouse. - I've been so busy these last couple of days I didn't get a chance. - You don't think I'm mad, do you? - No, no. - Good. - Mona, I don't I can, I've been so busy, I'm... - I know what you need.

These men weren't your friends, they worked for you. I think you're cleaning house, and I think you're doing a really crappy job. - You know, when I found out my friends had died, it was as if a part of me had died with them. Now you're telling me that they were murdered, and you're sitting here, jacking me around, while the killer's out on the street. Well... You better find him, pal. Before I do. Oh...

Asshole. - Well, I think that went pretty well, don't you? - Trent, why don't you take the rest of the day off? God, the LT was right, you are a pissing. - The answer's gotta be here somewhere. - Well maybe Gruman was telling the truth. Did you think about that? Maybe he's not behind it? - Well... He's connected somehow. He was blowing smoke earlier. - You can say that again. (chuckles) Relax. - Mm, that feels good. - Trent, I mean why don't you let it go? Ride out the next couple of weeks, and finish out your 20. - Yeah. Maybe you're right. - Who knows? Maybe you'll get lucky and Gruman will be the next one to drop dead. - Dickerson, what are you doing? Oh my. Wait a minute. Why are we assuming that Gruman's through wasting people? - Who else would he want to whack? - It would have to be someone who messed up. - What was the name of that punk you nailed in the gun deal? - Karl.

I know what I'm doing. - Yeah, and now her big brother knows what you're doing too. - He's an asshole. He just saw me with Holly today. - Alright, alright, let's back up. I need to know all about it.

You snip it, they'll notice the breaks are gone before they leave the parking lot. - Which cable is it? - Oh Jesus Christ, get up here, come on, let me do it. Come on. Stay low, don't let 'em see ya. - Why didn't you just ask me for the money? - It wasn't like that. I didn't know who Mona's dad was when I first started seeing her. Then I found out, and it was like why not? - Are you out of your mind? She's a little mafia princess, do you know what that means? - I got it figured, it's a lock. As long as I'm seeing her, her dad can't touch me. It's like insurance. - Oh yeah. That strategy's working really well with her big brother, okay. Now you're dating Gruman's daughter. Someone's cleaning house using a brunette hit woman. You're also dating this mysterious Holly, who's a brunette. - Okay, so you're saying Holly's a killer. Then what's she messing around with me for? - I don't know. Unless she's using you to get to Gruman or... - What? - Gruman's using her to clean house, and you're next in line. - No. It's gotta be a coincidence. - I hope you're not planning on having anyone else sleep over. - What? What do you mean? - Hey, I'm sleeping on your couch tonight. - Come on, what for? - You almost got your fruit pruned back there, and you gotta ask me what for? - Okay now. You scared them off. - Yeah. For now. - Just because dad's not around doesn't mean I can't take care of myself. Okay? - Yeah, okay. Wait for me. I'll get my car and follow you. (chuckles) (engine revs) (tires screech) (catchy rock music) - Oh shit. (car honking) (tires screeching) (car honking) (loud banging) (tense music) - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Have you heard anything yet? - No, nothing. - You want a light for that? (chuckling) - Detective Jacobson. - Yeah? - Donny's very lucky. He's got several broken bones, but no serious internal damage. He's gonna need a lot of mending. He's gonna be fine. - Great. Thank you, Doc. - [Doctor] You're welcome. - Do me a favor, okay? - Anything, name it. - Stay here until you can get a uniform to guard Donny. Nobody in but identified hospital staff. - Okay, why? Is something going on? - Donny's brakes were cut. - You think Gruman is behind it? - Don't know. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna change. Then I'm gonna get some answers, I hope. - [Holly] Wake up, sleepy head. Aren't we supposed to go hot tubbing today? - You must be Holly. - What did I tell you about this punk that was seeing Mona, huh? Huh? What'd I tell ya? - You said you would take care of it. - That's right. I would take care of it! Cutting the break lines, for Christ's sakes. What, you don't think his uncle, the cop, is gonna put two and two together? Huh? - He was asking for it. - Think! You think before you act, do you understand? Christ. As if I don't have enough problems. - Well, you should've seen him though. He was all over this trashy brunette. - I know. I know. I own that trashy brunette! (dark music) - I was just supposed to go out with him a few times and have fun. - And make sure you got pictures. - Yeah, that was part of the deal. Worked out pretty good, he even took his own pictures once. (chuckling) - You're a real pro. - It was just a gag. That's all I did, I don't know anything about these guys with heart attacks or whatever. Although a few guys have come close. - Darling, I believe you. How old were these guys? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong? - Donny's been in an accident, I've gotta get to the hospital. - But daddy wants to see you a minute first. - Now? Tell him I'll talk to him later, I've gotta see Donny. - No, Mona, listen to me. He wants to see you now, it'll just take a minute, okay? - Where did you get these? - I told you we didn't trust this guy. We've got him followed. - How could you show these to me! - Would you rather not know? - Come on, Mona. The guy's a snake. - Shut up, okay. - Honey, look. He was using you. Now, it's better to know now... So you see, that's the end of that. She'll go to her room, she'll cry for a little while. End of problem, huh? (chuckles) - I don't think so, Dad. (engine revs) - Aw, Christ. Look, Mikey. Follow her, will ya? Make sure she doesn't hurt herself. - You got it, Dad. (mysterious music) - [Eddie] You want me to catch her? - [Mike] No, no, just follow her. Jesus Christ. Where the hell is she going? (mysterious music) - Hey! - [Mike] Jacobson. - You come to finish the job? - [Mike] What the hell do you want? - I want you out of my sight. - Hey, we got fuckin' rights. - You think you've got rights? You want to try to exercise those rights right now? Come on tough guy, let's go, do it! - Come on Eddie, let's go man. Come on. - Back home? - No, swing around back, we still gotta find Mona. Yeah, Dad, it's Mike. No, we're down at the hospital. Look, I think you better get down here. Trent Jacobson's here. He's still trying to cause us some trouble. Okay, yeah. - Something's brewing, Lieutenant. Page Dickerson and get her back here and send some uniforms for backup. Yeah, thanks. (mysterious music) - Hi, honey. Came to see you. Are you in much pain? That's good. Cause I know about pain. Pain when your father hits you. That's pain. But that doesn't hurt as much as seeing him hit your mother. It's because when you're the one getting hurt, you get numb to it after a while. But when someone close to you's getting hurt, you never get numb to that. That's why I decided to have my father had to see his friends die, one by one. That'd be a pain he'd never get numb to. There's nothing left to talk about, I've seen the pictures. Oh, we would've been perfect. But you had to... (intense music) - Take her down to the lobby, backup's on the way. - Right. - Oh, and tell them to send some uniforms up here. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on here? - [Dickerson] Police business. - Oh Mona, what the hell's going on here? - Listen, you can talk to her at the station. - No, I'll talk to her right now. (gunshot fires) - Trent, did you hear that? - You stay there. - Hey. Hey Trent, wait, wait, wait. Don't leave me in here, Trent. Trent! - Would you tell me what the hell is going on? - Leave me alone! - What'd she arrest you for, huh? What the hell did you do? - Mike, we gotta get the fuck outta here. - Police, freeze! (gunshots firing) (gunshots firing) - Mona! - Mike. (gunshot fires) Drop it! (gunshot fires) (sirens blaring) (ominous music) Get some doctors here. - Mikey! Jacobson. Give me your God damn piece. - We gotta get outta here. - Give me your God damn piece! (intense music) Jacobson! (gunshots firing) (dramatic music) Mona! I'm sorry. Oh, my baby. (somber piano music) I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Mona. (phone ringing) (melancholy music) - Hi, Trent. - Hey, how you doing? - [Janice] I'm doin' alright. - I thought you were gonna take some sick leave? - What, and miss your last day? Thanks for coming to visit me at the hospital. - Yeah. You know, I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't been alright. - [Janice] Thanks. - Now that this Gruman thing is over, I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do, how I'm gonna spend my days. - Or maybe how you're gonna spend your nights? - That too. Or maybe we could work on it together. - I'd like that. - I'll call you tonight. Hey Dickerson. - Yeah? - You play basketball? How's it look? - Great. - You know, I've been thinking about this often, you know, it's been about me helping you with the studio. If I'm gonna do that, the nice man that I am, we're gonna have to set some ground rules. Rule number one, you gotta keep your pants zipped up. I'm telling you Donny, I don't know how you can just keep doing that stuff. You have to settle down, just find one woman, take it easy.
