[rock music playing] [woman] We're all trying to catch up with something. School, love, friends, family, classes. PRIVATE LESSON The list is long. Life is short. Maybe being an adult is all about trying to catch up. But what about the lessons in life? That's where I come in and become the person my pupils need the most. - Ah. Ekin, my art instructor. - Nice to meet you... Quite literally. Miss Asude, my life coach is here. Hello, there... By the way, I'm Azra. I instruct young people. And they choose the subject. It'll only hurt for a second. Ow! - Look. Check this out! - How's it going? [Azra] I don't think parents need to know every single detail. It's good. [Azra] At the end of the day, these are private lessons between the youngsters and me. WORLD UNIVERSITY [Turkish music playing] FINE ARTS CLUB CULINARY CLUB MUSIC CLUB [woman vocalizing] - [woman] Hi, what's going on? - Hello, girls. [woman] Hey. Why is that idiot dressed like that? [sighs] - And the name of the club is... - What does that say? Immo... Emo? Yeah, that's right. Emo. - Right. "Immortal Literaries Club." - [chuckles] What's so hard to read? - Take it easy, girl. - [laughs] Afife Jale! - Jale's her name. - [chuckles] The girl's not well. Come on. Let's go. You... no, my name's Hande! And seriously, none of you know Afife Jale? There's, uh, the cycling club, the Erasmus club, and this is the Immortal Literaries Club! No literary interest anyone? - This girl's a lunatic. - Lunatic, yeah. [laughing] [woman] This is outrageous. - [grunts] - Hey, you. - Hande? - [Hande] Afife Jale! Ah, I didn't mean to. - [gasps] - [door closes] [grunts] [sobbing] [woman laughing] Oh, my God, Azra. Seriously, you are like a miracle. Girl, if it weren't for you... - I would never be able to date Tibet. - [woman 2 grunts] - You're right about that. - [mutters] Easy, girls. Someone could hear you. - Oh, let them hear us. - Who could hear us in the girls' room? - [Azra] Let's check. - [woman] I don't care if anyone hears. You could use some advertisement. [knock on door] OUT OF ORDER - [woman chuckles] Oh. - [Hande gasps] Look, it's out of order. No one's here. I mean, if it weren't for your private lessons... "Tibet, what even are we?" is what you would be asking, hon. Cansu, shut up! - [Cansu scoffs] - [exhales] Oh, how he came crawling to me! I almost said he's gonna cry. You know what? You've literally become my image maker. When you called the chancellor as my mom, I died. I mean, you are just so talented. You're the best private tutor I've ever had in my life. [Azra] Girls, stop making this a big deal. Come on, let's go. - It's not a big deal. - [Cansu sighs] Azra, you are literally changing lives with your work. - [squeals] - [Cansu] That's an understatement. [woman] Wait. Wait for me, guys. - I wanna have private lessons too. - [gasps] - [Hande] I wanna be noticed. - [exhales] My dream is to be Utku's girlfriend. What are you talking about? Who are you? [chuckles] Oh, hi, I'm Hande. I overheard you talking in the restroom. So please, help me too. Please. So, first you sneakily listen to our conversation, then you jump out of nowhere like a maniac, and now you want me to help you? - Yeah, that's right. [chuckles] - Honey, have a good life. ["Sana Ne" by Karsu playing] [Azra singing in Turkish] [continues singing] - [shouts] - Azra, watch the road! Watch the road! I can't even watch movie scenes when they stare while driving. - Get out of here. - No, stop. I won't get out here! - [Azra] We'll see about that! - [Hande] I won't! [sighs] - [laughing] - [groans] You are something else, girl. Do you even realize that? Should I call the cops? - I have your phone right here. - What is it exactly that you want from me? Well, I want the exact same lesson you've been teaching Melis. - Hmm. - You know, the image maker. Or rather, making a boy recognize you type lesson. Yeah, all of that. - But I'm not... - And don't try to deny it. I heard it. Melis said who knows how many lives you've changed, and you didn't object, so that means there are others. Oh, we have a smart ass here, I see. What a surprise. That was honestly uncalled for. Oh, I'm sorry. What you just did wasn't? Come on. Come on. Hey, Azra, come on, please. - Please, please, please. - All right, open the door. We'll talk. You can have this back then. [laughing] - [Azra sighs] - [chuckles] [Azra gasps] Here you go. I was gonna snitch you out to my aunt if you wouldn't help me. You'd snitch me out to your aunt? [chuckles] What's wrong with you? Are you five years old? Call her, tell her I said hi while you're at it. Because I'm not gonna help you. - [chuckles] - Okay, as you wish. - [line ringing] - [Azra sighs] [woman] Hande? How are you, aunty dearest? What was that look about today? I couldn't say anything with all the students around. Yeah, we'll talk about that later. There's something very important I want to tell you. Make it quick, Hande. I'm very busy. Yeah, I know. You're right. It's not easy being the chancellor now, is it? - Honey, we can talk later, huh? - Who said that? All right, I have to go. See you. - Give me that! - Bye, baby. - [Azra grunting] - Ow, ow! - Gimme that! [panting] - No! Whoa, whoa! - Pulling hairs? - Hmm. What's wrong with you? Are you five? [Azra exhales] So, you're the niece of the new chancellor. [Hande] Mm-hmm. I'm just trying to understand here. What were you gonna tell your aunt anyway? That you were basically sneaking around the college and among the actual students. So, you're a wise ass. And the first one I meet here. Astonishing. You're like Afife Sherlock Holmes. [Hande] Don't underestimate my Holmesy charm. [Azra] Enough with the puns. Here, take that. What's inside that? - Yo, careful with that box over there. - [horn honking] God help me. What the hell! These people have blocked the whole road. Hey, careful. Careful not to break that. Hey, bro. [panting] You blocked the whole street. At least move those boxes, so we can get inside. Hmm. Hold your horses, sister. Don't worry. Building's not going anywhere. [Hande laughs] [Azra scoffs] [exhales] - Dude, move those boxes, will you? - [both grunt] Come on, let these sisters get in! But what's going on? [Hande] Hmm. Gonna sneak into my place as well, Hande? Oh, of course not. I'll just come back in the morning. Okay, fine. Oh, not a word to your aunt about this. No, never. My lips are sealed. Yeah. Laters. Oh, which floor? - Which floor? - [Azra] Second. Yeah, got it, second. What the heck's this now? [scoffs] [grunting] Excuse me! Um, anybody listening? Ugh. [exhales] [gasps] Oh, God, sorry. [grunts] Welcome to the building, I guess. Hello, sister. Who are you looking for? - It's you... - Burak. Apartment three isn't the best place to drop your things. - [Burak] Hmm. - Downstairs. Oh, but of course, you can't even see the number. Would you please move the cupboard? It'd be great to get into my place. Uh, I'm sorry, but I can't right now. Oh? When do you think you can? Hmm, not sure. You'll just have to wait, sis. Come in, man. Yeah, over here. [huffs] Sis. Oh, my God. [chuckles] - ["Are You Ready" by BBF playing, muffled] - ♪ Are you ready? ♪ ♪ Are you ready... ♪ [woman laughing, muffled] - [laughing continues] - [groans] [huffs] ♪ Are you ready... ♪ [sighs] ♪ Are you ready, ready, ready... ♪ [knock on door] Good morning. Oh, my God, I forgot all about you. - [grunting] - Mercury retrograde is really going down. - More like a meteor. - [gasps] - Huh? What was that? - Crashed all the way down. - Yeah, I don't really follow. - [door closes] Yeah, my point exactly. And you want private lessons now? Actually, I'd say I'm very good with lessons. See, I did a little research before I came here. That's a little for you? Indeed. So here it goes. The Art of Picking Up Men. Women and Men. A Time for You, a Time for a Change. However, I don't think it's actually about changing, because at the end of the day... Hande. Uh-huh. Yeah. Slow down, honey. - [exhales] - Easy. Easy. Coffee? No, I can't have coffee. Coffee makes me very vivacious. Then I talk too much. - Stimulants have that effect on... - All right, got it. - Chamomile tea then. - Tea is good. - [music continues, muffled] - [woman laughing] [Hande exhales] [woman laughing] Stop! [Burak] Yes, you're amazing. Yeah, you look stunning. - [camera shutter clicking] - Keep your chin up. Perfect. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay, now gimme that big laugh. [woman laughing] Why do you think everyone looks at me like I'm old? I mean, not that I'm gonna live worrying about what people think. - Kids sold their souls to social media. - [woman laughing] - [Azra sighs] - That's not even an identity, you know. It's like an avatar existence. Uh, I mean, what they have online is like an avatar existence. But am I like that? No, sir. You know, I like to think that I have my own sty... [grunting] [huffs] [grunting] You can't be serious. If I'm the one who's old, wait until they see you. Look at you. You're like an old hag. - [Azra sighs] - Yeah. Okay, but I don't think I look old, right? Do I look old? What if that's what Utku sees, Azra? Huh? - Why did you, out of the blue... - What did you mean by stimulant? - It's an arouser. I mean, for example... - And what's with the ugly outfit, huh? Well, I'm comfortable. You don't need comfort, Hande. You can be comfortable when you're old. - Are you a little on the edge? - Not really. Why? You're acting passive-aggressive. That's why I'm asking. Looks like you can confront Utku, since you're so smart. Threatening someone to work for you isn't great. I can be active-aggressive if I want. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But you're the only one who can help me. I will not leave your doorstep unless you help me. You know that, don't you? - This is exhausting. - Please. Azra, please! Look at it this way. I wouldn't threaten you if I weren't really desperate. [hangers clattering] [grunts] SCHEDULE Wow! She's really working. Is there a name for this kind of work you're doing? I bet there's good money in this. Hey, stop it! That is none of your business. Hmm. [Azra huffs] YOUR DREAMS ARE ONE CLICK AWAY [Hande] Why would anyone choose this as a profession? Are you healing from past traumas or what? - [computer beeps] - You have a new client. - Hey, Azra, you have a new client! - What the hell are you doing? - Ow! - Haven't you ever heard of boundaries? - So this is how people find you. - [exhales] I would have sent you a message as well. - Oh. - You didn't have to make a fuss about it. You think you just book an appointment? You need someone to recommend you. - [scoffs] - I bet my aunt would recommend me. [Azra exhales] Or even, what... what was that girl's name? Wait, wait a second. Don't tell me. Oh, right. Melis. I bet she'd recommend me as well. Remember? You called my aunt as her parent. Okay, fine. I got it. I can't get rid of you. There's a party at Utku's place tonight. - I don't know if you've heard about it. - I haven't. - Let's start with that then. - [laughs] Rule number one, you will do exactly as I tell you. Exactly. I promise. - Second, books can't teach you about life. - Mm-hmm. You need experience. And get rid of that nonsense. [Hande] Hmm. [exhales] I just need experience. [gasps, grunts] [exhales] You're sure your aunt won't come home. I don't wanna get busted. She's never there this time of day. [woman, muffled] Wow, Burak, you kept me up all night. I'm exhausted. [Burak] Don't mention it. Just tell me your schedule for next week... - [laughs] Oh. - Hey! Hello, this cupboard is still out here. Wow, apartment three. Good morning. I totally forgot about that cupboard. I'm sorry. They told me someone from the building was complaining about the truck, so, you know, I had to send the guys off early. That's the most pathetic apology I've ever heard. Look, look, you can see that I'm really busy right now. I'll get it moved once I finished. Promise. See you. [Azra gasps] Seriously? - Oh, God. - Stunning. She's like a work of art. Indeed. Just like you are. You shouldn't be so harsh on people this early in the day. Why? What's it to you? I had an ounce of hope, and now it's gone too. - [sighs] - Why would Utku like me? They're women too, so I... must be another species. That's for sure, but I don't think you saw them clearly. The second girl had cheap breast implants. But her under-eye fillers were not so bad. The first girl's boots were so out of style. And her hair was burnt, probably from straightening it too much. I'm pretty sure she can't even brush it through at this point. Anyway, listen, Hande, we need to be quick. Come on, hurry up. We've got a lot of work to do before the party, and trust me, a lot. - So many people are coming and going... - Hande! [gasps, groans] - Welcome. - [sighs] - Hi, my cutie! - [cat meows] NAZIM HİKMET NEW POEMS, TALES Huh. How long have you been living with your aunt? She's the one who raised me. Let's go to my room. I got some amazing things to show. - Let's go then. - Okay. Come in. See? I've got great stuff. Why would we need to buy new clothes now? Kids out there are starving. Seriously, how old are you, Hande? I mean, if you've set your eyes on Utku, we've got a lot of ground to cover. Is it that bad? Well, is the object of your desire really open for debate? [exhales] I'm positive I wanna be with him. You and I are going shopping. [gasps] But we have something important we need to do first. - Come on. - We have something important to do. [chancellor] Look, this is a revised version. This won't do, dear. You need to rewrite it. What... what's that? [chancellor] No, I'm not going to sign this. This is not the way to do this. Really, this is uncalled for. What can I say, Hande, baby, really, what? This is unexpected of you. And it is also out of the blue, this whole private lesson thing. The other day she called me. She was excited. But I couldn't speak, because I was very busy, and it got lost in the shuffle. All right, dear, that'll be all. Oh, you're a fan of Yıldız Kenter? Excuse me. Oh, oh! Right. I was a pupil of hers, actually. [chancellor] Hmm. Though that wasn't my major when I studied. In fact, I'm a graduate student of your college. - You went here? - [Azra] Yeah. Even though theater has always been my real passion. [chuckles] Thanks to my tutor, Yıldız. That's unbelievable. Wonderful. - Great. Hande, listen. - Hmm. If you had told me this from the get-go, things would be a lot different. She's obsessed with standups, but what good will that do, right? [laughs] You need to have a solid foundation, right, Azra? Well, aunty, of course it's not easy to be as perceptive and astute as you are. I mean, it takes time, but I'll get there eventually. But now that I have the amazing Azra, she will help me reach my dreams. By realizing your potential, yeah, exactly, but it's always important to set the right goals for yourself. - That's so true. - [chancellor] You got that right. - Bravo! And, Hande, good job to you, baby. - [Hande] Oh. - [chancellor] You're amazing. - Stop it! [chancellor] Well, then, good luck to you. - Oh! [chuckles] - Well, never mind, I'll get it some way. - I guess. - Oh, but by the way. I'm was thinking of taking Hande to the Nazım Hikmet Oratorio tonight. Just for starters. With your permission, of course. And so I might drop Hande off a little late tonight. [chancellor] Okay, but not too late. Ready to get started? - Yes, please. - Come on, then. - Inner beauty is important, Hande. - [gasps] Oh, silly me. I thought the term inner beauty was referring to the soul. [laughs] Azra! [gasps] Oh, my God. I have boobs! Wait a second. Wait, wait. Azra, I can't believe it. They're literally like 3D! Azra? Azra, let me ask you. What do you think about... [Azra] All right, now it's time for makeup. [Hande] Come on, don't underestimate me. Even I have a makeup bag. It was a sample. Hang on, uh, let me show it to you. - And what's inside it? - Um, lipstick, blush, mascara. Uh-huh. [Hande hesitates] Why? What else should there be? I'm gonna leave that here. Come on, Hande, let's go. - Hey, Azra! Oh, I just love... - [Azra sighs] Azra. [laughing] Azra. [chuckles] [both laugh] [dance music playing] He looked. Utku Atalan has just looked at me, so I'm going home, because I can't do this. Hande, stop being silly. You can be shocked later. But now it's time for action. Move. Wait, I can't walk down. - [Cansu] Hey! - Hi! - How you doing, ladies? - Good! - New pupil? - Correct, and it's all thanks to you. - What's that supposed to mean? - She's the chancellor's niece. - No! Wow. [chuckles] - [Azra] Mm-hmm. - [Melis gasps] - She eavesdropped on us in the restroom. What were you talking about in the restroom? Nothing, just, you know, girl stuff. Anyway, let's drink up. Come on, live it up. We're at a party, aren't we? Love that for us! Here, girl. - [laughing] - [Hande coughs] Enjoy it, girls. [dance music continues playing] - Yes! Give it to me! Yes! - Ah. And she hacks yet another password. No, honey, your girl is no longer dealing with petty little passwords. Listen to me. From now on, it's international waters for me. Cansu, just be careful and try not to get into trouble, okay? It would take us way too long to explain to your mother what a hacker is. Oh, you can't even imagine. My mother literally still thinks Facebook's the Internet. [both laugh] [Utku] Attention, people! Señores, señoritas! Are we having fun, yet? [cheering] This guy is so full of himself. All right, as always, this sexy sombrero I'm wearing will go to the king or queen who will have the most tequila shots tonight! [cheering] [Utku] Let's bring on the shots! [dance music playing] Here you go, peeps! [laughs] - Yeah, come on! - Whoo-hoo! [music continues] - Shots? - [Melis] Whoo! [laughing] - [music continues] - [laughing] - [laughing] - [Hande] Azra! I'm having so much fun, you know. Right now, I'm so happy and... [laughing] Hande, I can see that, but you need to get a hold of yourself. This is not good. Azra! Hey, I can't hear you, Azra. It's too noisy in here. - And I can't understand anything. - Let's throw some water on your face. - [Azra] Duygu. - Azra. - Why... [sighs] - What's up, Duygu? - Cenk, Azra. [sighs] - Wow, Azra. I've heard about you. [Azra] Hmm. Well, I was just telling Duygu she could crash at my place tonight. But she's saying her family wouldn't let her. I heard you're an expert at handling these things. - You need to leave the girl alone. - Leave her alone? - Who do you think you are? - We should go. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Hang on a second. Hey, cover for us tonight, will you? Don't worry. I'll pay for your troubles. - [grunts] - Yeah, wrong number, man. Get out! [Cenk gasps] [huffs] See what he wants from you? Do you even realize how he's making you look? I've told you over and over again. I warned you. Go home right now. - Do you have enough money for a cab? - I do. - [dance music playing] - Thank you so much, guys. Thank you. Whoo! [laughing] Yeah, yeah! That's right! Ooh! [laughing] Hande! Hande! Azra, I won the hat! Azra... Oh, Azra! Oh, Azra! Hey, wanna help? I was just looking for a pick and shovel. So we can bury her. [both laugh] [Hande panting] [grunts] I can't believe how stubborn you are. Look, this cupboard is still here. - You think I'm the stubborn one? - [groans] You think I'm the one being stubborn? Look, it's already 11 p.m. I still need to take her home. How are we going to get inside? [Burak] Is there someone at her place? Why don't you ask her? I'm pretty sure you're up to something. Never mind. What are you talking about? No one's up to anything. [sighs] Whoa, whoa, be careful, be careful. - [grunts] - And you've been eavesdropping on us. [Burak] Oh. [Hande groans] - [lock clicks] - [Azra gasps] Oh, no. It's Makbule. She's our local Mrs. Grundy. She's trying to eavesdrop on us. Oh! Like you. You two will get along. [chuckling] - [Hande groans] - [Azra grunts] Look, stop being stubborn. We can't get in here, so let's just go to my place. - [Azra] Nope. - Come on! - Can you please locate the bed? - [gasps] Shh! Hande! Shh! - [Hande] I need to lie down. - Let's go to yours. - [Hande speaks muffled] - Hande, quiet! Hey, I'm sorry the place is a mess. I'm still getting settled in. [Azra] Oh, no. We're so sorry to barge in like this. Thanks for the help. She's okay, right? - Hande, you're okay, right? - [Hande] Yeah! - Okay. I'll make some coffee anyway. - [chuckles] [sighs] Would you like some coffee as well? [Azra] Yeah, don't mind if I do. The whips are probably in the bedroom. [scoffs] What's that you said? Uh, I said the neighbors are asleep, I imagine. [water sloshing] - [Azra gasps] Hande! What are you doing? - [Hande] Oh! - Get up. Stop, sweetie, just stop. - Leave me alone! Hey, leave me alone! - Get up. [groans] - I just wanted to wash up. This woman... - This Azra... - Hmm. [Hande] ...she is the perfect woman. Because this woman will set me up with Utku. But don't tell anyone. [Burak] Mm. - [Hande] This woman, amazing! - [chuckles] [gasps] No, you don't know her. You don't know her. No, no, no, sir. - [sighs] - [Hande] But she can do it. She can do anything. - You don't know her yet. - [clears throat] You're absolutely right. I had no idea who she is. But... [Hande laughs] I know her name is Azra. I would love to get to know more though. [sighs] - Hey, listen, listen, listen. Listen. - Huh. I'm Hande, by the way. That's me. But I've no idea if it's one or two syllables. I mean, you can't really expect me to know everything. [laughs] Hey, he's making me laugh! He's making me laugh! [laughing] What exactly did she drink? Tequila, but I guess it hit her like Absinthe. - The kid could use air. - Choking. - Great idea. - [Hande] I can't... - Wait, I'm telling you I can't breathe. - [laughing] - [laughs] Wait! - Up you go. - [Azra] Come here. - [Hande sighs] Wow, this feels good. - [Azra] Take a breath. - [Hande sighs] [exhales] [chuckles] You know, guys, I really thought I was gonna get old without ever dancing or having a boyfriend. - [chuckling] - You're such a blessing, Azra. Oh! Hmm. - You're such a blessing. Aww. - [Azra chuckles] By the way, I don't think anyone even realized that, but I was pretty drunk. And you don't even need that much. And you know, I'm done with that, like, serious... oh. Coffee? - Coffee. Azra, are you sure about this? - Yep, you'll feel better. - Are you sure? - Yes, drink up. - [slurps] - [chuckles] Whoa. Mm. That's weird. Doesn't that car look like my aunt's car? [Azra] Huh? [fast-paced music playing] [chancellor] Thank you. What? Ülker? - What's Ülker doing here? - Well, I texted her my location. [Azra gasps] Because, you know, I've been too much of a burden for you today. Please, my apologies. I thought I should be on my way. - Good for you, Hande! - By the way. - [hesitates] About my aunt's car. - [sighs] Stay here. Do you think the car looks like my aunt, or my aunt... [grunts] ...looks like the car? But that car's really... - Ooh! - [Azra] Hey, grab one end. Grab one end. - What do you mean grab one end? - [Azra sighs] - Hande, shh! Wait. Don't let her go. - Wait, wait, wait, my sombrero! No, later. We'll come back for it. - Please let me find my sombrero. Please! - We'll come later, okay? Quickly, quickly. Oh. The elevator. [gasping] Too late. Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs, upstairs. - [sighs] - [Ülker] Hande? Ülker, hello, there. Hello. - Oh, hello. Up here. - Oh. Okay. [panting] [music playing over dialogue] Oh, my! [grunts] - Listen, here's what we're gonna do. - Okay. We're gonna play a great game together. - Are you ready? - I am. [chuckles] [both] Shh! - Hmm. Yes, hello. How are you, Azra? - Hello, there. You're here. Yes, rightfully I must add, to take Hande home with you. Because she called you. Um, did you find the place easily? Yeah, yeah, it was easy. Fine. - Great. - Um, where's Hande, honey? Hande. Yes, I was just coming to that. Uh, where is Hande? [chuckles] Almost sounds like a play, right? [inhales] Like, For Whom the Bell Tolls, right? - [chuckles] - Yes. Uh, Hande! Why is she keeping me waiting at the door? Why? Well. - [sighs] Hande dear. - [Ülker] Hande! Oh! Hande's sleeping. - What? - Well, she's asleep. We had a very long day. She's fallen asleep. - What's all this about? This is unusual. - Well... - Step aside, child. I need to see her. - All right. [grunts] Hande. Hande, get up, baby, get up. Honey. Maybe we let her sleep. No, no. What could I do? This is not good at all. I mean... Uh, we just moved in. - I hope you don't mind. Place is a mess. - All right. All right. - [Azra gasps] - Tell her to call me as soon as she wakes. - First thing. - You can count on that. I promise. - Good night, then. - Good night. Oh, dear, oh, dear. This is so unusual of her. [grunts] [sighs] [grunts] Hey, what's up? [laughs] What is that? Is she gone? Yeah, yeah. Where's Hande? [chuckles] Shh! [laughs] Azra. Oh, my God. I won! I won for real! I did! Let me. Let me. Yep, you're right. You won. You're so good at the quiet game. - You really play it well. - Hey, don't be a killjoy. - [laughs] - By the way, that wig looks good on you. - Why, thank you. - [laughing] Stop it. - Let's go. - All right, fine. - I appreciate it. - Thank you so much. [Burak chuckles] Okay, now... [sighs] ...time to sleep. - I'll run back upstairs to grab our stuff. - Uh-huh. - What? - Oh, nothing. So, I was drunk. I wasn't blind though, was I? - Hande! - [laughs] Oh. - Go to sleep. - Okay, good night. - Hey! - [Azra exhales] Can you tell Burak I said hi, please? [lights click] [gasps] [exhales] Huh. Didn't finish your coffee. You could come back and finish it if you want. Well, no, but I should go. But I came because I need to get our things. So, I'll just go grab them. - [chuckles] - Hmm. - [pop music playing] - [sighs] [vocalizing] [Azra] Now, here's our first subject. How to attract guys. [laughing] What do you think was Cinderella's biggest mistake? Duh. Giving in to her stepmother. No, choosing a guy who only cared about appearances. [Hande] Oh. What... you just insinuate something? No, I'm just enlightening you. [scoffs] You need to find your own style. You always look down on girls trying to be like pop stars while you're trying to be Afife Jale. I'm not judging the actual clothes in your wardrobe, but you look like an ancient author styled you. [Hande] Hmm. Hmm. Be yourself. Myself. Hello, there. Welcome. [Azra sighs] [Hande clears throat] A double shot macchiato at 50 degrees with skim, no sugar. You? I don't really care. [chuckles] And a black sugar strawberry milkshake please. [server] Coming right up. Don't ever say that you don't care. If you don't care about yourself... Why would anyone else care? Exactly. [chuckles] Mm-hmm. So do you know what's the first thing men find attractive in a woman? Um, titties? PUT A SMILE ON Booty. Mnh-mnh. Hmm. - Ah, the smile. [laughs] - Wonderful. Thankfully, yours is already great. But you need to learn how to look in men's eyes when you smile at them. Because we reflect what the person in front of us makes us feel. - [laughing] - Good job. Come on, you're good to go on out on the field. [Hande sighs, squeals] [players chattering] I thought that field thing was metaphorical, but you really did bring me to a game. How cool. [chuckles] Always try to stay in plain sight, but you should never approach directly. [Hande] Oh. Okay, okay. He's coming here. Hmm. Oh! He looked at me. Oh! Welcome to his radar. [chuckles] [upbeat music playing] [music over dialogue] [Azra] Oh, one last thing. Don't laugh at his jokes so much. This is the hardest part. Because when you're really in love, this is almost impossible to keep up with. [footsteps approaching] [motorcycle engine revving] Drunk queen's not here today? [laughing] Don't laugh at his jokes so much. Um, it feels so empty now. [Burak grunts] [chuckles] - Come upstairs for some coffee? - Why not? Sure. But, um, rain check, perhaps? I don't think we should rush into that. [chuckles] Sure. Uh. Uh, right. We shouldn't rush into it. - Uh, when do you think we could? - Mm-hmm. I don't really mind. Don't you ever say that you don't mind. If you don't care about yourself... I'll just go inside then. Okay. Good. You do that. You go inside, and I'll go upstairs. - Okay, great. - Okay. [chuckles, sighs] - See you. - See ya.

I can't let a man inside. - You really are something. - [laughing] I'm begging you, please. - Please indulge me just one little kiss. - [laughing] Well, this is not the Stone Age anymore, mister. If you're serious about it, you'd ask for my dad's blessing, and then, you'd get a kiss. Oh! Such things are frowned upon in the 1800s. [laughs] [door closes] Where did you come up with that? - Okay, come in. - [Burak laughing] The 1800s. [Azra sighs] [laughing] They think when a man and a woman go in an apartment, they immediately sleep together. [coughs, clears throat] Can't you and I, I mean, can we just be friends, huh? Uh, I know, right? [chuckles] But besides, we're neighbors, bro. [sighs] Right, right, sister. Sister. - [cups clink] - [Azra sighs] Well, make yourself comfortable. Your living room's really cozy. You tore down the wall? I mean, for instance, well, please don't get me wrong. What? Wrong about what? Well, I mean, I kind of get it if she thinks that way of the guests that you had the other day. Never mind, I mean... All right, all right. I see you're still hung up on it. [sighs] I think there's a Makbule hidden inside of you. Whoa. Why would you say that? Well, you thought I slept with these women. Oh, no, I didn't actually think that. It wasn't me. I mean, I was saying Makbule thought that. But why would I think about that? Okay. All right, this is getting weird. All right, all right. So, I can, uh, tell Makbule how everything turned out in the end. So, there's an actual answer to that? [Burak] Hmm. You got curious about the costumes that evening. - [grunts] - [Burak] Or you weren't curious. You were dying to know. Just dying to know, and you didn't even ask me. What kind of woman are you? Why wouldn't you just tell me if I was curious? Because you didn't ask. It was private business. I'm not interested in your fantasies. What fantasy? You know what I mean. The costumes and the wigs. And all the women. You thought that... [laughing] You thought those costumes... You know what, my dear Makbule? You have really watched too many movies. [scoffs] You need to stop calling me that. - [knocking on door] - [grunts] - Aha! See? She called the police on us. - [chuckles] [sighs] [exhales] Azra, please, just listen to me before you get mad. What? Get mad about what? - I know I promised you, but... - Hande, tell me what happened. Look, I asked you to listen to me before you get mad, but you're mad already. Come back again. - [Hande splutters] - Hmm. She tends to go into this frenzy, so she needs a reboot. [exhales] - Oh! Hande. Welcome. How are you? - Burak, nice to see you. Utku's coming to pick me up soon. And? I told my aunt we'd be studying dramaturgy together, so I'd be staying at your place. But please cover for me, because I really wanna go. Hande, how could you lie to your aunt before telling me about that? - [cell phone rings] - That's what you're really worried about? [sighs] Oh, I'm so sorry. What if your aunt calls me? Or she calls the girls? - She was suspicious the other night. - See? She's calling me. Come on, please. - Please, please, please, please, please. - Please, please, please. All right, fine, fine. - [Hande gasps] - [Burak chuckles] Thank you! [Azra sighs] Hey, um, if you're worried about her, we could always just follow her on my bike. You really mean it? Hmm. [chuckles] Oh, my God, thank you! Would you be scared if I rode a little fast? [Azra panting] - Well, hop on. - [whistles] - [Turkish music playing] - [vocalizing] - I'll make it worth your while. Okay? - Consider it done. Fellas, where you going? Leaving without me, huh? What are they doing? Why are they on school grounds? I have to do something about this. Hey, wait a minute, what are you doing? You'll only embarrass Hande. We'll all be embarrassed if her aunt finds out about this. There's a whole academic administration before her aunt. [exhales] No, they're the same. Hmm. [panting] See. There they are! [Burak grunts] But you don't have to do this, you know. I'm definitely not leaving you alone. [both sighs] All right, you coming? Coming. [grunts] I've never done anything this crazy before. Uh, how come we're at school this late? Just wait. You ain't seen nothing yet. [both chuckle] [Azra panting] By the way, I'm a photographer. Okay. - So those girls coming in, they're models. - Okay. - So, all those costumes are... - Oh, no! Security. - Come on. - Security? Move it. [panting] [panting] Yeah, those costumes are for photo shoots. - So what? - So that means... That means I don't have a girlfriend. [both] Ah... - [chuckles] - Okay, come on. Let's go. [Azra panting] Oh! Were you jealous of those other girls? - Who? Me? Oh, God, as if. - [exhales] What? I'm not jealous. What are you even talking about? I mean, what do those girls have that should I be jealous of? Well, nothing at all, of course. They're only the winner and the Model of the Year runner-up. What's there to be jealous of? - [chuckles] - [grunts] You're such a jerk. [chuckling] But I'd rather be taking your photos, honestly. You would? You're way prettier than they are. Oh, come on. - [slow-tempo music playing] - [vocalizing] Your elegance, your beauty. - [laughing] - Your smile. You tilting your head back when you laugh. And when you're nervous, biting your own lip. - [cell phone vibrating] - [gasps] It's nothing. This is from Utku. We'll be by the pool. Don't forget to delete the footage. [man] Leave that to me. It's easy. - Though I'll watch them before deleting. - The pool. [exhales] How you doing? - [Azra panting] Yes, there they are. - [cell phone vibrates] It's Ülker. [grunts] Hello, Ülker. Um, Hande's actually in the bathroom. Would you mind if I call you in a minute? Okay, great. Talk to you soon. Let's go. Now let's see how crazy you really are, huh? - [Hande] Oh. - Hande! [gasps] Azra. [Azra] Why is your phone on silent? You know how many times I called? Didn't you think it might be urgent? [Hande sighs] Huh? - No, please. - Oh, no. I don't wanna bother you. Well, it's our school, and it's our pool too. Why would I be bothered? [sighs] Hande, grab your things now. Let's go. Princess. [exhales] - [grunts] - [Hande groans] [Utku clears throat] [Azra groans] [Utku] And who the hell are you, huh? What's your problem? What's wrong, man? Hey, Azra. - I was really... - Seriously, Hande. All of this for that asshole? - What are you doing? - [exhales] - I really had no idea we'd be... [sighs] - Enough! It's not about that. - [exhales] - I'm gonna call your aunt now. Pretend you just came out of the shower, okay? Utku! Come on, bro. Leave it. You see, we're all young here and having fun, huh? We have our reasons to be here. What I don't get is why you're at the school this late. Huh? Or wait, don't tell me. I'll find out anyway. I got it. Don't worry. What are you gonna find out? Honestly, I'm dying to know that. I'll tell you if wanna know so badly. I'll find out what that hag is really up to. Oh! Is that what you'll do, pretty boy? Look at you. - Dude, it's okay, we don't need this. - Hmm. This isn't over. [kisses] That's my point. [Utku] Buh-bye. - Come on, guys! Aren't we gonna have fun? - Yes! WHEN SHOULD WE DO THE SWIMMING LESSON? [sighs] Burak. [gasps] Hey. [chuckles] - How are you? - I'm good. You? - I was on my way to you. - What? I can't hear you. I was gonna drop by your place. - I don't understand. Go around that way. - [sighs] - [exhales] - I wanted to ask if you had plans tonight. I don't. Why? I think it's time to have dinner, without hiding or fleeing. - Or sobering up drunk youth. - [laughs] Just the two of us all alone. What do you say? I think... I think I would like that. Sounds great. So, what time then? Uh, would you mind if I called you later after my class? Sure. I'm was planning to visit my folks tonight anyway. [chuckles] - So I guess we'll be in touch. - Sure. - Hmm. - See you. [Hande chuckling] [Azra] Oh. I once had a tutor who told me to never say yes to dates right away, but I think we lost her. Uh-huh. Maybe you should check yourself before judging me, all right? [inhales] Azra, listen, I wasn't the one who wanted to break into the school. - I told them. They wouldn't listen to me. - It's not about that. - It's about what then? - It's about the misconception you have. Getting a guy is never about just getting into bed with him, Hande. - That is just a goal in their game. - [sighs] You're confusing me with someone else. For me, it was never about sleeping with him anyway. Yeah, but that's what Utku's after. Besides, what are you doing with those people? They're idiots. Don't you see? Didn't you see how they're acting? You almost got both of us into trouble. Huge mistake. Why is it my fault when guys act that way? I thought we have equal responsibility. Men and women aren't equal. We're in balance. Everyone plays their part to complete what's missing. You understand that? You know, I'm sick and tired of this ten rules and regulations for finding love. Why am I not allowed to live the way I wanna live? You are allowed. But you need to be patient until you can discover that balance. - Just get to know him first. - [sighs] I never liked that boy's behavior anyway. - I mean, that thing he did drove me crazy. - [exhales] - Unbuttoning your shirt. Seriously? - [gasps] - Azra. - [scoffs] Utku didn't mean any harm, really. - [scoffs] - He just wanted me to blend in. And you know, just have fun with everyone. That's all. Hande, learn to say no to people. Don't jump into every idea. Like your ideas? - [scoffs] - [cell phone rings] UTKUMYLOVE LET'S HANG OUT SOMETIME - Whoa! - What? What? - What you just said. - Oh, what did I say? You just said "whoa," Hande. Oh, that. I just got an email for an 85% discount on Russian classics. And it's a limited time offer so I'd better get going. - Yeah. - I should go and check it out. Thank you so much. I'll, uh, talk to you later. - [Azra grunts] - [both chuckle] - [chuckles] Bye, Hande. Okay. - [door closes] Oh, I'm late. I'm late. [sighs] Who came up with this idea for a trip? [woman] Well, it's just a school trip, Daddy. And remember, Mom, Miss Tuğçe will be with us. Bahar, I don't like you staying elsewhere. You know that. I don't like it either. At all. İsmail, that's what I just said, no? Do you think you're emphasizing it when you add an "at all?" Don't make fun of me when the kid's here, hon. [laughs] Son, where are you? Where have you disappeared to? Come sit with us for a while. Don't upset my sister. Come on. Just let her do that trip. What's so wrong with that? - Miss Tuğçe will be here soon. - Mm-hmm. I believe, to ask for our permission. We'll see what will happen. Aww, Mom, you're amazing! - You are the best mom in the world. - Oh, ho-ho! [laughing] Wait, wait, we didn't say yes yet. Off to the kitchen. [sighs] Any good news for me? Yes, actually. The two of us are gonna have dinner alone tonight. We'll see. Good. Are you still mad at me about everything? You should be happy. I don't understand. Well, if I'm angry, that means there's still hope, right? Mom's upset too. Is it really only Mom, Dad? Go on, help her out, go. [Burak sighs] [doorbell rings] I got it. It's Miss Tuğçe. You go ahead. Hmm. Come in, come in. - [chuckles] - Is everything ready? - Absolutely. Everything's great. - [gasps] - Let's call them out. - Okay, great. Mom, Miss Tuğçe's here. - [Azra sighs] Hello. - Welcome, ma'am. We were just about to have a bite. Please. [Azra] Oh, no, no, I don't wanna be a bother. - I'm here to talk to you about this trip. - [mother] Welcome, Miss Tuğçe. You're not off the hook unless you eat with us. [Azra] Well, in that case, I need to use the restroom. - You know the way. - [Azra] Yeah, I do. - Thank you. - [Bahar] Please. Thank you. Listen, don't suffocate the girl, and please don't embarrass her in front of her teacher. She's old enough to go on a school trip. Why wouldn't you let her? Just let her go. - Even her teacher's come all the way here. - [timer beeps] [mother] Oh, that's the oven. - Be a dear and bring the tray, Burak? - [Burak] Yep. [Bahar sighs] - Ma'am, here you go. - [Azra chuckles] - Thank you. - Welcome. You were telling us something before you were interrupted. Oh, um, yeah, right. So it's an ordinary weekend school trip. - I'll be with them at all times. - [Bahar chuckles] And we're all gonna, um, hit the road in, like, about two hours. - I'll drive Bahar home on Sunday evening. - Yes, exactly. Um, Miss Tuğçe, this is my brother Burak. [mother] Son, put that on the table. Miss Tuğçe, pleased to make your lovely acquaintance. [chuckles] So, what's this trip's about? What? [Burak] Whose idea was this trip? You said you'd hit the road in a couple of hours, huh? Am I wrong? You don't have any other plans for today, ma'am? - [Azra] Uh... - [mother] What are you talking about? I thought we're against Bahar staying somewhere else. What the... - Well, uh... - [Bahar] Burak. This is a lesson for you? If you'd excuse me. - Oh, certainly. Please, you're excused. - What are you... Burak. - Please, you're excused. - God, what the hell are you doing? Miss Tuğçe! - [İsmail] Son, what was that about? - [mother] That was embarrassing. I'm being a good brother. What's wrong with that? Burak. [thunder crashing] Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Don't you think you owe me an explanation, Miss Tuğçe? Azra. Or should I call you "Apartment Three"? - Maybe your name's not even Azra. - No, my name's Azra. Wow! Azra's your real name. - Well, that's swell! - Hmm. You do what for a living? Change names and deceive families like that? Not really. I'm just helping young people. - Help young people, you said? - [sighs] Look at the way you look. You even put a wig and glasses on. What are you trying to look like? Lady, who are you? Really, who are you? I can explain if you just... I don't wanna he... What were you gonna do with Bahar? Where were you planning to take my sister? - You are not listening. - Why should I listen to you? - Do you realize you lied to me? - [thunder rumbling] You're making money out of those lies, aren't you? - [slow-tempo music playing] - [vocalizing] - [exhales] - Hey, hang on a minute. What's wrong? Is it too much for you to hear the reality of this? Well, I guess since you're familiar with lies. This is the reason I didn't tell you. This is exactly why Bahar chose to speak with me, instead of speaking to you. What's that mean? First of all, my sister and I are very close. At least we were until you showed up in our lives. Is that right? These kids need me because everyone thinks the way you think. You think you understand her, but you don't listen to her. Oh, please. Hey, Burak. What do you think you're doing? Is it a crime to go on a trip with my teacher? Look, look at you. You're still lying through your teeth, damn it! Go inside, Bahar. You're making me furious! I really wish you'd listen. - Hey, who do you think you are, huh? - [panting] Really, who are you? You'd think you'd have an ounce of dignity, just an ounce! You're telling me that you wish I listened to you! Why would I ever listen to you, huh, why? [engine turns over] Why would I ever listen to you? Should I listen to all the lies that you told me? - Look at the way you look. - [sighs] [Burak] You even put a wig and glasses on. What are you trying to look like? What do you do for a living? Change names and deceive families like that? Who are you? Really, who are you? Azra! Azra! Azra! Damn it, "Azra" what? "Azra" what? What do you want? [panting] Makbule, I'm sure you're dying to know what this is about. Don't bother eavesdropping, I'll tell you everything. See this guy? This guy's so prejudiced, he won't even hear me out. Wait. Why don't you tell her from the beginning? Why? Would you even listen? Makbule, hello. Do you see this girl? She walks around in disguise taking money from families. - And she made my sister lie. - Leave Bahar out of this. I wonder who's pulling her in. You would understand if you just listen to me, but you don't listen! [exhales] [huffs] [groans] [gasps, sighs] [loud bang] [sighs] [sighs, exhales] [sighs] [sighing] [knocking on door] Move. [cell phone ringing] No, Duygu, I'm really not in the mood... What? Calm down, calm down. Where are you at? Coming. I'll be right there. [gasps] You have no idea who Azra is, do you, son? - Azra... - Look, I hear you loud and clear. But it's not at all what it seems, okay? The girl's right. You obviously don't listen. - But I'm not like you. - [sighs] I listen fine. Such things are usually frowned upon in the 1800s. - See? - [grunts softly] How would your sister take dancing classes at all if it weren't for that girl? Dancing you said? Where did that come from? [groans] You really have no idea, do you? Wait. How do you even know about this? Son, Azra's yapping on the phone all day long. And the walls are paper thin. Wait a minute, wait. So, Bahar is aspiring to be a dancer? She's already a dancer. [Burak hesitates] You really don't know the kind of money your parents have been paying Azra? Azra has been using that for dancing classes. - [groans] - [Makbule] There's a contest this weekend. - What, a dance contest? - Mm-hmm. [Burak grunts] [Azra sighs] How could you send pictures to someone you met online, Duygu? Who is he? Have you met him in person? Romantic Vagabond or something. I don't know. That's all? - [sniffles] - You sent nudes to someone you don't know? You can't do that, Duygu! He's the one that's blackmailing me, but it is my fault now? [Azra exhales] Did you send him any money? - [sniffles] I did. - Hmm. I did, but it's never enough. He wants more. He's already posted a photo of me with my face blurred out. That's why I called you in a panic. He says if I don't pay him right now, he'll share my face and my name tomorrow. - Can't believe this jerk. - [sobbing] Duygu, how do you always manage to find guys like this, huh? I have no idea. [Azra sighs] Why didn't you ask me to help you? Why didn't you talk to me? [Bahar] Because I was all alone, Burak. And it fell on my shoulders to fulfill my dreams. You don't get Azra at all. And what she means for us. She was there for me when you were not. She's been like a big sister to me. She's a good person. She's doing good for all of us, and you need to realize that. If you're in there, can we talk, please? Azra, can you hear me? - [slow-tempo music playing] - [vocalizing] What if you asked your parents to help you? Oh, you're right. How could I not think of that? Wow, but how could I tell them, right? You were peeling oranges in the living room, and I went into my room and sent nudes, huh? Huh? My dad would have a heart attack, and my mom would die of embarrassment too. Get it? What if he shares? [sobbing] What if they see it? [blubbers] [Azra] It's okay. They'll either kill him or me. I can't take this anymore. Stop. That is nonsense. Maybe I should give him more money. - But I... I can't take this anymore, Azra. - Stop it. What are you doing? - I can't take it. - Shh! Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. I'm here for you, okay? Don't you worry. We'll figure this out together, but you need to trust me. - Promise? - Promise. [Bahar continues sobbing] [gasps] Emergency. Grab your gear and come to my place. Nothing. I ravaged the guy's machine, but there's nothing to be found. I'm sure he's storing them on a hard drive somewhere. How could you still not find out who he is, huh? - Hmm. Hold on. - What? - [Cansu] Aha! - Tell me what's going on. Come on. Girl, wait a second. It's not easy. The guy set up a security system at his place. If we can log onto it through the computer, we're golden. - That's it, girl! - [chuckles] So what are we waiting for? Log into it. Maybe we can see where the hard drive is. Wow, that's a brilliant idea, actually. I'm doing wonders here. Can I have my congratulations first? - All right, good job, good job. - Congratulations. [Cansu] Hmm. Okay, we're in. The guy's not home. I bet he's on the prowl. Though this place looks really familiar, doesn't it? [Duygu] Maybe you've seen it on a TV show? [Cansu] Yeah, maybe. It looks familiar to me too. - [gasps] Shit. - Oh, shit! - What did you just see? Oh! - [Azra grunts] - That's Utku's place. - Yep, that's the one. I told you the place looked familiar, didn't I? [sighs] So now we know where he gets the money to live like this. Money from people like me. And I was at that jerk's party! Good for me, right? Seriously, you all should congratulate me. I'm such a stupid idiot! And Hande's after this guy. [sighs] Damn, she will be devastated. [sighs] How am I gonna tell her about this? Well, we'll figure out a way, I suppose. [exhales] You should be happy she dodged a bullet. - I mean, can you imagine? - No, shut up. I don't even wanna think about it. - Ugh, damn. - Wow! Just what we needed right now. - [sighing] - That's just great. But all the other buildings have power. [Azra] I know. This is a problem with our building. It's old, and they still haven't renewed the wiring. Oh, damn. Girls, I have more good news for you, it seems. - What? - My battery's dying. Why, you ask? Because Murphy! Oh, that's okay. Now we know who it is, right? We're okay. I'll go down and check the circuit breaker. - Okay, fine. You go. - [Cansu softly grunts] [Duygu exhales] [upbeat music playing] FOLLOW THE THREAD [vocalizing] [Azra] Burak? Burak? PRESS THE BUTTON [clicks] ["Varsa Yoksa" by Birkan Nasuhoğlu and Elçin Orçun playing] I CANNOT FACE YOU [sighs] I DON'T WANT TO BREAK YOUR HEART I THINK I'M BAD AT APOLOGIES I WAS AN ASS! WILL YOU FORGIVE ME? [laughing] [sighs] - [Burak grunts] - [laughing] [Burak] I've been a jackass. I know. Will you forgive me? You look ridiculous. Come on, take that thing off now. When did you even set all this up? You shouldn't go to all the trouble. - Azra, I was just too slow to catch up. - [cell phone ringing] But now I realize, I didn't know you at all. - If you give me one chance, I promise... - Listen. Burak, I'm so sorry, but this is very important. I really need to take this. Yes, Cansu, I'm listening. What? Oh, okay, I'm coming. I'm so sorry. I have to go. [panting] I can't even apologize properly. [panting] Cansu, are you sure? How do you know? Of course I'm sure. Check this out. Here. [Azra] Oh, no. That's Hande. I don't believe this. How could you go to that guy's place without telling me? [exhales] - Hande, answer it. - [Duygu] She hung up! Know what? If she finds that hard drive, all our troubles would be over. That hard drive is not our only problem anymore, Cansu. - [Hande sighs, chuckles] - [lighter clicks] So, what would you like? Whiskey, wine, fruit juice? Fruit juice. - [Utku] Mm. - Uh, or wine. - White or red? - Red, please. Right away. [cell phone vibrating] - [Azra] Hello, Hande. - I'm listening, Azra. What are you doing over there? Uh, what am I doing where? What do you mean? Hande, I know you're at Utku's place. Utku is not who you think. You need to get out of there. No, Azra, you're being ridiculous, just like my aunt. [Utku] Do you like almonds? Uh, sure. Look, I'm here. I'm okay, and everything's... Uh, hello? Hey, Azra. - I think you're breaking up now. - Hande, wait, wait. Don't hang up! She hung up. [huffs] Maybe like this? No, come on, really. [typing] Wait a minute. I'm getting a different signal right now. Wait. What do you mean different signal? Oh, shit! What's wrong? - Azra, this one's bad. - Just tell me what's going on, Cansu! Hey, hang on a second, okay? Look, the guy has other cameras in his house. So he's not only using photos for blackmail. - He's recording himself as well. - [Azra gasps] [chuckles] Did you do something to your hair? - [chuckles] - Hmm? It's very beautiful. [Azra] Hande. What are they doing? This is not good. This house seems to be in a strange location. Do you think I could find it if I go now? Hey, Cansu, can you get the location for me? Sure, let me jump into that. Azra, do you even realize what you're asking me to do? If I could do that, I'd be working for the FBI right about now. Seriously. You don't need to get riled up. - But you're driving me nuts... - I got it! I got it! He texted me the location of the house. You're amazing. Can you send it to me? - I texted you. - [Azra exhales] Okay. - I think they're about to make out now. - What? [Hande chuckles] Oh. Can I maybe have some water? - Water. - Water. Definitely, princess. Water. [clears throat] Hmm. Hande. [sighs] How could I have made such a terrible mistake? [Duygu groans] - Guys, I think she saw it. - [Azra] Huh? She found it. She found it. She found the camera. Shit. [inhales] [groans] Shit, shit, shit. God. [panting] Princess, where are you going? Uh, I have the smallest bladder. - Water just goes right through me, so... - Water? - [Hande gulps] - [chuckles] Uh, is there a bathroom I can use? - Yeah, it's just upstairs. I can show you. - No. I'm good, going now. Thank you so much. [chuckles] Oh, shit. [groans] [Utku] It's the last door on the right. Um, got it. Got it. [clicks] Hey, Azra, she's calling you. - [cell phone rings] - [Azra grunts] Hello, Hande. [Hande] Azra, Azra, there are hidden cameras in here. Okay, listen. Listen to me. Calm down. Look, we can see you right now. What? You can see me? Uh, but where? Oh, my God, this is too much! This guy's such a pervert! What the hell! I can't believe this. What a pervert! Hey, Azra. What if... what if he put some drug into my water? What if I pass out here? What will my aunt say about this? Oh, my God, come here. Just come get me, please. Guys, you two keep track of her. Hande, whatever happens, do not leave that bathroom, okay? I'll be damned if I don't give that guy a piece of my mind. [exhales] - [sighs] - Burak, this is not the time. I gotta run. So sorry. But can you at least tell me where you're going? Yeah, I'll call you. [panting] Hande. Hande, are you all right? [Hande] My battery's about to die. My phone will die. - I'm sure of it! - Calm down. I'm on my way. I'll be there very soon. [groans] [horn honks] Move, damn it! Princess? Princess? I'm not your princess! Oh, God! [sighs] Princess! Uh-oh. I don't think she'll make it. Come on, Azra, come on! Damn it, Hande, come on! - [lock rattles] - Princess. [sighs] Come on, don't keep me waiting. Hande, are you okay? Do you need anything? [whispers] Oh, my God. I can't believe it. What are you doing in the bathroom? What are you doing in here, Utku? [chuckles] What... what the hell are you talking about? I saw all the hidden cameras! Will you open up for me? What have you been dreaming up, princess? I can't believe you're still calling me that. You're still calling me princess, damn it! And I thought you actually liked me. I thought, "This is it." "Finally, I found someone to open up my heart." All you're interested in is opening up other parts of me! Publicly, huh? Spare me the big words and open up. - Hande, open up this door, Hande! - [gasps] Open the damn door! [exhales] Hey, look, if you're gonna stay locked in there, why did you chase after me, huh? You were following me everywhere, like a stray cat! Now you're getting cold feet? [Hande] You've got yourself in big trouble. I'm serious. Hey, who do think you're threatening, huh? - Who do you trust? - [gasps] Who the hell are your people? Who the fuck are you? Look, if you think that aunt of yours has got your back. - I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking... - [doorbell ringing] [continues ringing] [panting] - [gasps] - [ringing continues] - [lock rattles] - [gasps] Please, Azra, I'm here! I'm upstairs! Well, well, who do we have here? - You asshole! - [grunts] Get the hell out of here! [grunting] - [Utku shouts] - [shattering] Thanks to you, I couldn't even apologize properly! - You can consider yourself forgiven. - [banging] [Azra gasps] - [Hande] Azra, I'm up here! - What is it, huh? What? - Are you guys nuts? - Not really. Why? What do you want from me? [shouts] You remember the other day when you were asking me who we were? [grunts] - [Duygu gasps] - Ooh! [chuckles] [Utku grunts] - You understand who we are now? - [groans] - [Azra] Are you all right? - I'm all right. I'm okay. [exhales] First dates are really hard, huh? - [sighs] You're crazy. - [chuckles] [Azra sighs] Okay, found it. [Duygu sighs] Come on, Azra. It's on. Wow, that is a lot of Duygus. "Alparslan." Yes, got it. [sighs] - [Cansu sighs] Yeah! - [laughing] She found it! POLICE [chattering] [Azra] Yeah, don't worry. Hande is all fine. We're about to take her home now. You two should go home too, all right? Okay, I'll see you soon. [exhales] We make a good team. Don't you think? - I guess we do. - [chuckles] [indistinct chattering over police scanner] [Azra] Hande? Excuse me, officer. Where are you taking her? We need to take her statement at the station. It won't take long. The guys will drop her home after that, miss. No, if she's going, we're coming too. We're not gonna leave Hande alone. And who exactly are you? - Um, we... we're her... uh... - Yeah, we're her teachers. We're both her teachers, aren't we? - Yep, that's right. - Hmm. All right, then. You can follow us. We'll meet at the station. [Azra exhales] Hande, if you please. [Burak groans] [Azra grunts softly] Up for coffee? [grunts] But so late? What else is there to do this late, than have some coffee? [slow-tempo music playing] [vocalizing] - [door opens] - [Azra] Oh. [both] It's us! [chuckling] [Azra laughs] [exhales] [chuckles] [Azra] What do you think is the meaning of life? Curiosity? Joy? Fun? Love? We're all pupils in search of ourselves, but sometimes, in order to find yourself, you must lose it first. And sometimes, you find yourself in someone else. And your story is then complete. You already know. I'm Azra. I give private lessons to young people. They pick the subject, and I teach what I can. - You all look very pretty. - [women laughing] Yes, loving your energy. Just one last time? - Wonderful. Hande, what are you doing? - I'll be right back. Be right back. [gasps] - Hande. Mm. - [chuckles] I'm so proud of you, my baby girl. And do you know why? Is it because I make everyone laugh? Because you were persistent in your path and stood fast. - Good for you, girl. - [chuckles] - I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. [Hande gasps, squeals] - [laughing] I am so happy right now. - You were amazing. - Thanks to you, I literally found myself... - Shh! Oh, so sorry. If it weren't for your sneaky lessons and all your rules. - [laughing] - Hello. Can we take a photo with you? - Sure. - [woman gasps] [chuckling] - Thank you. - No, thank you. [sighs] - Hello. Can we take a photo with you next? - Of course. [laughing] [sighing] - [Azra] Oh. - [Hande chuckles] [Turkish music playing] [vocalizing]
