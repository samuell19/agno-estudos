Thank you, Porto Alegre! I'm Fernando Maia, the director of the play, and I'd really, really like, on behalf of the group, to thank you who came to appreciate another play from Third Force Drama Group. I kindly ask a round of applause for these marvelous crew! Kiko Silva and Xande Pinto. And our diva Lana de Holanda. Let's not forget the writer who's here tonight. Our wonderful and talented writer who created this amazing play. Mario Fraterno! -Come on! -Come over here! Come on! Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. -What the heck? -Easy, easy. It's kinda slippery... Thank you! I almost had a heart-attack. I don't even know how I got here. Your writing is wonderful! I had to call you. It's not about that. Our life is a stage, didn't I tell you? The stage is not our life. I keep telling you that, but you won't listen! It was just a kiss. Want another one? It's vibrating. Look. It's dad. -Hi dad. -Hello, son. Everything okay? Yeah, I'm great. -Where are you? -At the Thea... -Amphitheater. -Lunch break! -Of the college? -What am I studying? I'm reading this author... Vizma Siemel. -A poet from Latvia? Really? -Microeconomics? Actually, it's microeconomics applied to international business, dad. Very interesting. Let me be you study buddy. Let's go to your place! Son, it's so noisy there. Is it your break? Yeah, it is. The professor is calling me. -Right. Okay. -Call me back later. -Bye. -Okay, dad. Thank you. Bye. Seriously? Why can't you just be Mario Brüderlich? -It's nicer. -Much nicer! Just tell your family about the Third Force. They don't even know I exist. Right? -Tell them! -Do it! Mario, Fê is right. You're together for ages and you don't wanna come out. And we are here for you, friend. It worked out for me! Guys, you don't know my family. If they find out that I'm gay, it'll be like an atomic bomb. -Let it explode! -Boom! No, I can't. You don't know my dad. He's terrible. You have no idea. No way. WELCOME TO NOVA PETRÓPOLIS Dad, I'm gay. "Dad... I'm on my way." ALDEIA DO IMIGRANTE'S PARK There you go. Brüderlich. The most traditional brewery in these parts. Do you know it? Mr... -Caco. -Caco, right. I won't take long. Of course, Mr... Mario. Mario, the one that...? Sorry. -Vicente! -Tell me you're here to stay. How are you? Better now that you're here. And with an MBA? Who would have guessed? -You look great. -You too, my dear. And how are things back home? Grandma Helena, Camilinha and Bianca? -They're all great. -Good. What about dad? The same as ten or maybe sixty years ago. Everyone is dying to see you. I have news. I hired this amazing coach from Sao Paulo to help us out. We'll finally take Brüderlich beyond, brother! It's so good to have you here. Really good. Thank you, man. You see, Vicente... there are three things you don't know about me. Did you stop wetting the bed? Start with the first. The first is that I don't like beer. I prefer whiskey. It doesn't get you fat. And the second? So, the second is... that I left to study Business in Rio, but I became a writer and... I'm writing a book right now, so there's no MBA. A writer, Mario? Yeah, I'm a writer. Is that a problem? And the third? So, the third thing is that I'm living with this theater director that keeps his savings in a piggy bank. Good, he's saving money. That's great. And? The pig is pink and it has flowers on it, and we call it Mary, the Economist. I don't get it. I'm gay. I have been living with him for four years. -Four years? -Yeah. Four years. And I'm not back to help you with the brewery, I'm here to tell everyone. During lunch. What do you think will come from that? Peace of mind. I don't want to spend my life lying. I'm brave to be happy, and that's what I want. To be happy. Seriously, Vicente, didn't you... Didn't you suspect it? Never saw it? -Saw what? -I dunno. That I was different? I never thought you were different from me. Thank you. -These are beautiful. -Thanks. Good job. -Hey babe. -What's up, hon? -You good? -Good. Yeah, I'm good. What did you do yesterday? -I stayed home. -Tell me the true. What the hell? -Mario? -Crazy bitch! -Bitch? -Are you trying to kill me? Hello? Mario? You never called me that before. No, babe. I was not... I'll call you back. I have a situation here. Ma'am, I wasn't... I was yelling at someone else... Oh God. WOMEN SHOULD BE IN THE KITCHEN! WHEREVER THEY WANT Hi. Do you know where the Werlang Hotel is? Thanks. Your flowers, sir. -Thank you. -Sure. Thanks. Uncle Mario! -Call me if you need a ride. -Sure, thank you. Uncle Mario! Where's my favorite niece? Where is she? But I'm your only niece. -True. -Look. Your play hit 500 followers on Instagram. -Wow. That's good, right? -Sort of... But don't worry, I'll give you some tips. Okay. Come on! You're getting big. Janaína, did you get Mario's favorite bedding? What about the cakes he likes? Did you buy it? Take care of things while I'm out. Yes, ma'am. Traveler from distant lands, what carries thee? I carry flowers, milady. From the most sweet-smelling garden. And a bag packed with bliss. Give me a hug! My dearest! I was waiting for you! So, kiddo... Remember me? How could I forget the grumpiest person in this house? And the sweetest. C'me here, Janaína. Give me some love. Mario! I've missed you! -You look gorgeous! -You look hot! How is my brother-in-law? -I'm... I'm... tight. -Daddy, look who's here. Better late than never! Salvador, do me a favor. Don't call me "daddy", you're my son-in-law. -And you... -How are you, sir? -I missed you. -Me too. -We'll have your favorite for lunch. -It's my favorite, too. You don't even know what it is. -Partridge. -I cooked it. Dad, I'm gay. No, no. Not good. So, dad, I'm gay, you know? Daddy, I'm gay. Dad, there was this kid... there was this kid that wanted to be brave to be happy. The flight attendant -went to the farm to ask for her hand. -I see. The old man looked at him and said, "Are you sure?". And the flight attendant asked why. "Because she likes big bulk cocks". And the flight attendant said, "Who doesn't?". Mr. Vicente. -Yes? -The roach is here. -You mean the coach? -That's what I said, coach. Ok, thanks, darling. -Dad, the coach is here. -What coach? I need no one at the brewery. I've been there for 40 years now and now I should listen to someone else's orders? -I'm doing a great job. -I agree. -Right? -Sure. I know, dad. But these are different times and we need to evolve with it. I understand, son. But that's brand wise. The essence is what really matters. The coach may not even like beer. Well, I'm a beer fan. Ana! How are you, Ana? -Great. -I'm glad you came. This is Ana Melo, the new coach we hired to modernize Brüderlich. Hi, how are you all? Nice to meet you. So it's a "she" coach. I thought it was a "he". I'm sorry to let you down. I'm a "she" coach. Nonsense. This is my brother Mario. He's just arrived from Rio. And he got an MBA in Business. That could come in handy. Great. I'm Ana. I'm Mario. Excuse me. Lunch is ready. Good! The partridge should be eaten hot. -Come on. -After you. Dad, now I understood the joke about the flight attendant. Ana, what do you do exactly? I develop effective strategies to provide financial growth and market safety. Mario is good with that. He may give you some tips. I'll keep that in mind. -Are you married? -Why do you care, Salvador? No, sir. I rather be independent. How could she find a husband working like that? I'll remember that if I ever look for one. So children are out of the question? -I thought about it once... -Did you? But then I quit the vodka, if you know what I mean. I do know, but I raise my children so they'd know their place in this world. I see. The place you believe they should occupy? -Right? -You know, girl... Ana. It's Ana. -Ana. -Yes? Dad, please. -Please. -Daddy. Please. Shut up, Salvador. -Sorry. -Don't worry, Vicente. Ana and I are talking. If she's gonna work with us, we should get to know each other. Right, Ana? Exactly. You father was showing me Brüderlich hospitality. It's quite interesting to enter the realm of the Alphas. Who would know? Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt whatever this is... -Mario... -What, dad? -What the hell? -I have an announcement... -What? -Another one? I'm sorry, Mario. I have some things to say. -I'm not done yet. -Wait a second. If you have something to say, do it. We are having lunch, after all. I'll tell you a story. Once upon a time a boy who felt different. He was one-legged? He had a nasal voice. He liked other boys. Ouch. He's a faggot. Like daddy's flight attendant joke. -It was a good one. -Yeah, but Vicente can't tell jokes. The boy was terrified people would find out. Vicente, what do we have to do with this miserable chap? He's miserable indeed, dad. A man who trade his happiness for his family's values. And today someone special told me that we should be brave to be happy. Don't. I'm gay. Sweet Lord. Camilinha. Oh my! I'm glad you're laughing. I wasn't expecting that. Did you hear what I said? Not really. What do you mean by that? Dad, Vicente is pranking us. He wouldn't say that. It's not a joke. I'm done living the life you want me to live. What I meant is that I'm homosexual, faggot, gay, queen. That's what I meant. Like a nancyboy? Vicente, if this is a joke, it's in a bad taste. It's not a joke, dad. I'm really gay. I'm a homosexual man. Enough! You're embarrassing me before my family. Get out. -Dad, don't do that. -Quiet. Off you go! Now! -Dad, please... -Get out of my table! Out! Now! Go away. You're not welcome here. What's wrong with you? This is our family. Shame on you. A gay son! Uncle Vicente! Pack your things and leave! Vicente... Guys, this is the 21st century! Are you really that surprise? In my class, there's a boy with two dads. Both gays. No one judges him for that. Okay, dear. Go and sit. Well... There are worse things than that, right, daddy? "Daddy?" God dammit! God dammit! Stop calling me... Dad? Dad! -Oh my! -What's wrong? Breathe. Call a doctor, please. -Dad! -Breathe, daddy. Daddy. -What's going on? -Breathe, daddy. -Daddy! -Dad! I don't understand why we can't go inside. I wish... I wish they'd tell us how daddy's doing. -I wanna talk to daddy! -Stop calling him that! -He's not here now. -It's annoying for me too. -How's daddy doing? -Mr. Antônio is doing well. -Don't worry. -Great. It was a minor angina. Nothing to worry about. Mario! Your father wants to see you. Only him. The word is out, isn't? What word? Of your heart-attack? The word of the shame that came upon our family. I'll never be able to leave the house again. Everyone knows, right? Oh, so you mean that word? How could I be so blind? I should've realized that your brother was a... faggot. It's not something written on people's foreheads. Maybe not, but the grimaces... The way he crossed his legs, I don't know. The way of walking or the clothes. He sounded like a man. But that combed hair... Dad, you don't need to dress like a women to be with another man, you know? How do you know that? Me? I know nothing of it. People just say that. Right? You knew, didn't you? Only if I did... No, I didn't know. Cross my heart. Mario, you're charge of the brewery now. What? You're my last hope. Me? That's too bad, dad. I can't. I can't. I don't have the time... What about Bianca? She'd be great at it! -Bianca? -Yeah. Bianca. Come here. Come here! Are you suggesting a woman should manage our company? And her jerk of a husband. A pain in the ass... Dad, breathe. Breathe. You should manage it. My only man child. -Easy, dad. -My only proud. -Son, take over the company. -Easy, easy. I'll stay, okay? I'll stay. I'll stay. -Will you? -Yeah. I'll stay. -How's daddy? -He's fine, it was just a scare. Did he ask for me? Well... I'll be at the brewery tomorrow to take over. About that, Salvador... Dad asked me to take over. Say what? But I'd appreciate your help. Tomorrow. At the meeting. Is that okay? I'll be there. Thank you. Excuse me. I saw your calls, but I couldn't answer. You have no idea what just happened. Oh my God, it was... A tragedy. Yeah. Call me when you hear this. Is everything okay? How's your father? He's fine, it was just a scare. -Mr. Antônio is strong. -Good. -Is there anything I can do? -What? Do you guys need anything? Oh, no. Bianca will stay. I was going home. Then... I could give you a ride? Yeah, sure. Cool. I just left the hospital with zero intention of going back. Chill. In this speed, we wouldn't go to the hospital, we'd probably die. Good to know. How's your brother doing? -I don't know. -Didn't you talk? -About? -About him being gay. You grow up with someone and suddenly... -May I say something? -What? -I admire his courage. -Son of a bitch. But Mr. Antônio taught you the intolerance speech. No, of course not. Actually, my dad... wants me to take over the brewery now, but my plan was to go back to what I love. Love? Yeah, drama. I love drama. -I'm a writer. -Really? Yeah, I left for Business school and graduated as playwright. My father kicked me out. I'm leaving. You know your father. He'll forget. I gotta go. God dammit. Let me get you straight. So, see you tomorrow? Tomorrow, right. I have no idea what I'll do. -Shall we? -Yeah. Vicente hired me until the annual party, so I'm here to help. -Really? -Yes. Yeah, but... Are you okay with that? Sure, I'd love it. Thanks. And my guts tell me amazing things may happen. Don't you fell it? -Hello! -Hello! -Hi. -Hi. If I know him well, he's into Ana. No way. Ana is not his type. You think? -So... -So... Tomorrow. -See you. -Bye. Good night. Good night. For God's sake! You son of a bitch! I spent seven years in that brewery dealing with him! Our father! I did! While you only cares about your dreams, Mario. You're too selfish. Playing of writing in Rio whilst I'm stuck here. You're being an ass, that's it. An ignorant hillbilly, just like dad. Just like him! -What did you say? -An ignorant hillbilly. This ignorant provided for you all these years. Not anymore! We're done! Darn it! Darn it! Damn you, Mario. Can't you see that we lost our dignity because of our family? We're fighting a fight that isn't ours. This is not our fight. Stop you two! Your brother made a decision and he should be respected. But grandma... Okay. Yeah, sure. I got it. Bye, grandma. One day your father will come around. The bright side is... your brother led the way, now they know what to expect. One gay son took him to the hospital, two will get him killed. I know it's not my place, but that's super lame. Back home we are two gay sons and one lesbian daughter. Jeez, how will you procreate? We bought a Chihuahua. I'm serious. Mario, will you come to the show? Nando, I dunno. Everything has changed. I must help them out at the brewery. Are you honestly considering suit up and manage the whole thing? No, he'll wear a bombacha. Knock it off, Xande. This is serious. His brother came out and his dad had a heart-attack. -So much drama! -I'm a realist, dear. He likes to write, right, babe? Tell me, what about your novel? I'm dying to read it. You'll be the first to read it when it's ready, okay? -The first. -I'm sure it'll be great, because you're great and your writing is great! You are great. Okay, but only after the annual party. -Not before. -You'll crash the company. No, babe. Ana will help me. -To crash the company? -Wait. Ana? Who's Ana? -Ana? -Who's she? She's a coach they hired. Didn't I mention her? -This is a pussy alert. -Dangerous in heels. They come like cats and then... Furtive felines! Ask more. Stop that! Knock it off. -Jeez! -Sorry. Tell me, Mario. Is this Ana person single? What is this, Fernando? She's a professional, okay? And the poor thing is ugly. A bagger. Mario, you have a mission. Tell your father, and come back to us. -Kisses! -Bye! -Miss you! -Bye bye! Miss you so much. Poor kitten, found his own brother in the closet. Is his brother active or passive? That's so lame. Everyone is "flex" now. Maybe today. Back in my days, it was called "pud". -Pud? -Passive until you die. Don't do that! Get out of this bed, Antônio. Quit the act. A man of your age acting like that. The doctor discharged you. What a shame! Ashamed of your grandson? No. I'm ashamed of your prejudice. A homosex... son... Homosexual. You can't even say it. Such ignorance! Did you know that homophobia is a crime? Vicente ruined our family's name! Enough! Enough! Get out of this bed! So help me God... This is where the Brüderlich magic happens! Come on, Mario. Excuse me. Seriously? Mario, what's your plan? Mine? Ana, what's our plan? My plan is revolutionary. Think big, Salvador. I believe a company's growth relies on innovation. Knowing its customers. Customers are fussy, they don't buy anything. We need to follow their demands as much as possible. The most successful segments invest on the Pink market. That's the LGBTQI+ community, Salvador. By essence, these products break the usual patterns. My suggestion is a Pink Beer, to promote representativeness and valorization, so they can be whoever they wanna be. THANK YOU She's absolutely clueless. Salvador, tell us what's the startup mentality? -Start to what? -Try that again. Are you trying to kill daddy with a pink beer? I'm sure Mr. Antônio likes to make money. Mario, I was wondering... is there a rosé lupulus, a reddish malt or some berry that could make it pink? I believe that... The lupulus. -The lupulus? -Yeah. Okay, and we'll also need an appealing strategy to attract people to the Brülich experience. So I thought, why not present the Pink Beer at your annual party? The Brüderlich Annual Party? Exactly. Ms. Ana, what do you know about beer? I think she should focus on a rosé wine. -I think you should grow up. -I think you... I think we should wrap it up. It was a very stressful day, right? To all of us. And I'm... Hungry! Very hungry. Let's have some dinner? No. Thank you. I'm afraid I'll have indigestion. -Okay. -Sure. Since Salvador declined your invitation, I'll go. ...really tasty. Thank you for showing me the cultural aspects of the Serra Gaúcha. I couldn't thank you enough. -Cheers to that! -Cheers! -Tell me... -What? Do you really think this Pink Beer is a good idea? Of course. I'm good at what I do. But we didn't come here to talk about business, right? -We didn't? -No. Then what? -You. -Me? I'd love to know more about Mario Brüderlich. -Do you have a girlfriend? -What? Girlfriend. Do you have one? No. You're so cute. You're embarrassed. You are blushing, Mario. Your love has trapped me -It's... -It's Pabllo. My niece chose it, I don't kwon how to change it. -How sweet. -Hello? Hi. No, I can't talk right now. I'm in a business meeting. Excuse me! Okay, sure. Deal. Me too. Bye. Sorry, I didn't mean to interfere with your hooks-ups or anything. What? I can assure you. There aren't any women calling me. MÁRIO, WHERE R U? -Nando, relax. Maybe it was a serious meeting. Mario is so uptight. Chill. He must be working like a dog. -A shot? -I'm can shout! It's tequila. Drink up. I know this author that reminds me of your work. You should read her. Vizma... -Siemel! -Siemel! -I can't believe you know her! -I do. I love her work! No way! I thought I was the only one who knew her! That's the universe putting the right people in our paths. Don't you agree? Spray your perfume, girl Go crazy No one can resist Your intoxicating love Come, honey, cuddle me I'm a baby, I need kisses to feel better Give me the pleasure To satisfy you Warm me up Turn me inside out Wear me down Put me on all fours Fill me up with love With love Spray it! Spray your perfume! Spray it! Spray your perfume! Spray your perfume! One for the road! I didn't think the "road" meant your hotel room. It's cozy, isn't it? So, you know... I've never been very brave. I'm more of an unresolved, quiet person. And whenever I see trouble, I run away. I just run and don't look back. But when you find something worthy, we become brave, you know? Doesn't it? It does, yeah. It does. So, Ana, I... There's something you should know. I have someone else in my life. It's okay. I have a boyfriend. I'm gay. Of course you're gay, Mario. No straight guy could be so fun. "She couldn't decide whether to kiss him or leave. Smashing the door so loud, it would scare him away. So she opted to stay put. Right there. Staring." "And life would decide for her." You write beautiful things on your blog. Mario Brüderlich. Or is it Mario Fraterno? Feelings are showing up It's better if you don't resist And give it up to me Give me your hand You're gonna be my star It's complicated But it's easy to understand I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT. YOURS, MÁRIO. I tried to avoid Looking into your eyes But I couldn't react So, I got comfortable I think it's silly To try and hide And deny my intentions I'm sorry to show up like this. I was in the neighborhood and Mario mentioned, since we've been friends forever, that you were hospitalized. But I'm better now. Ready for another round! Daddy is a rock. And Mario isn't here, is he? He is, sure. But he's sleeping. -Really? -He had a hot date last night and got back late. God only knows. He hasn't got up yet. It was a long night... Right. Sure. Punch. Punch all the way. Right. He's a ladies man, a five-star gamer. So tell me... Are women from Rio really hot? -Smoking hot, you know? -And tanned. But I'm in a relationship. I have this girlfriend, so I can't really... She's a writer! A good one. I wish Mario had a girlfriend involved with art and culture, you know? He will, Mr. Antônio. He will. I really wish I could talk to him. It's been so long. Maybe we could just wake him up. -Mario! -Mario! Guys, come one. Calm down. Calm down. I'll ask Janaína to wake him up. A friend of my son is like family to me. -Okay? -Good. Janaína! Yes, sir. Wake Mario up, please. -Mario! Wake up! -Don't... Don't yell. We have guests. Go to his room and wake him up. Got it? -Go on, dear. Go. -Sure. Always me. "Janaína this, Janaína that." Always me. Who's house is this? Dear God. Up and downs these stairs. I can't take it anymore. Look at the time. And the boy is still sleeping. Sweet Lord. Mario? Always me. Mario? Your father is calling downstairs. Your friend is here. A handsome one. Handsome? So tired. What? My throat is sore. It's the humidity. I guess. Who would've thought? -And Sunday there'll be a match. -We could drive there. We gotta leave early because of the traffic. Mario! Look who's here to see you, son! What's up, lady-killer? Playboy! Womanizer! Come here. Where were you, jerk? Jerk! What are you doing here, are you nuts? Nice seeing you, bro. Now that's a real friend. He came all the way from Rio to visit you, son. -Hi. -Hello. -Are you the famous Fernando? -Yes. Uncle Mario told me all about you. -Really? -I'm Camilinha. I'm well aware of who you are. -You told her? -I did. You did! What about your hot date? Wait, wait. Tell him all about it and I'll start the fire. Go, Mr. Antônio. Do it. Today you'll taste a traditional Gaucho barbecue. Fire! -What? -You what! -What are you doing here? -You were evasive! I'm doing my best and you keep... Quiet, girls! We need to practice to help Mary out. And remember, we are a traditional family. Miss, shoulders up. Watch your posture. Why are you swagging? You should walk manly. -And what's with the gum? -No, I can't do it. I'm extra queer, Kiko is even worse. Lana, go by yourself. You're convincing enough. Of course, it's easier for her. She's a woman. -She hasn't been a man in ages! -Not exactly. I still have some man in me. "Some" man, indeed. Mind your business or else... And dear, size isn't all that. Depends on the man. The guy. The prey. I didn't sleep with her, okay? A bagger! Bagger! So where were you? We had dinner. -Dinner? -Yeah. She needed to see some company documents, and that was it. I was stressed. I stopped at a bar and got hammered. -What? -Smells like pussy. -What? -I smelled it miles away. Guys, do you fancy a sausage? -I love it. -Great. -Mario, are you still into it? -I am. Hey, Rio guy, the South has the best sausages. Thick ones, you know? I do know thick ones. -Thanks, dad. -Thank you, Mr. Antônio. Camilinha gave me this perfume. -Really? -Really. Now drop it. -But... -I've got a hangover. I don't wanna argue. Enough. You know you get drunk easily. Why would you do that, silly? I missed you. You look adorable with a hangover. You think so? Do you? Mario! I brought a mate tea. Put it on the table. We'll drink all of it. I like mate tea. It's strong! With some sweetener, maybe? Sweetener? Yes. Thank you, Janaína. First the lipstick stain, then the arguing, and now the sweetener. Tell me, babe. How are you going to tell them so we can go back home? So lads, grill or stick? Kill... grill. Stick! -Yeah, stick. -We have both. -Great. -Thanks, dad. -Thanks, dad. -Cheers. Cheers. About that... My family is going through some hard times right now. As you can see, they need me... And there's a new beer coming up, so... What do you mean? You wanna stay here? -What about me? -Don't be selfish! My dad almost died. Stop thinking about you. You're hiding something. What? I know it. Nonsense. "When two people are no longer a couple, one hurts, and the other doesn't. But it's useless to fear going away, because what really matters never leaves us. Even when we don't want to. So, in the end, you leave nothing nor no one in fact." May I help you? Good afternoon. We're Mario's friends from Rio. Me and my boys were just in the neighborhood, and decided to pay him a visit. Is he home? Yes, they're all by the pool. -Go ahead. -Thank you. Sneaky Mary. Rich as a bitch! Fernando, have you tried our beer? Sure. When we hit the club, we only drink Brülich. Fernando, my dear son! I've missed you so much. Come and give your mamma some love. -Mamma? -Mamma. I've missed you! Mamma. I was worried about you. Hi, Mario. It's so nice to see you. -Are you okay? -Hi. -Welcome, ma'am. -Nice to meet you. It's my pleasure. Come. I'm Antônio Brüderlich. -Sure. -Mario's father. -Mario's father! -Come and join us for lunch. You're more than welcome. Oh, I love peperoni. No, ma'am. That's a local sausage. We're screwed. So screwed. -Here's a palette. -Let me see. Do you think it's possible to make the beer look like that? -This reddish? -Yeah. To make it this reddish the special malt won't do. You'll need another element, like a fruit or maybe hibiscus. You should be working here. -I used to, as chemical engineer. -Really? I made new formulas once, but dad didn't approve it. Then I met Salvador and Camilinha came, so I quit. I see. I'm sure he'll approve this one. -Yeah... -Yeah. -Great house. -It is, isn't? Very pretty. Well... What a beautiful lot! Mom, I'm glad you came. I'd like you to meet Lana. She's Fernando's mother, Mario's friend from Rio. My mom. Helena. Enchanted. This house is like a palace. It's my pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Helena. It's not actually a palace, Mrs. Lana. That's true, grandma. No, I mean... We are just an ordinary family, right? -Yes, sure. -Just ordinary. Keep it down, mom. Down. Mrs. Helena, these are my brothers. Kiko is the youngest. -Nice to meet you... -He's aphonic at the moment, due to a pharyngitis. A severe one. Right? And Xande. My eldest. From my first marriage. What's up, royalty? It's hot. -It burned. -It did? Did it? -Guys, weren't you off to... -Gramado. Wait, wait. Why so soon? We better go before the storm. That's Saint Peter telling you to stay for the night. I'm sure it's just a drizzle. Let's go. Sweet Lord, it's a torrent! Mrs. Lana. Your husband couldn't come? -My husband? -Yes. Actually, I became a widow 13 years ago. Kiko's father. I'm so sorry. And you never thought of remarrying? I haven't find the right man yet, you know, Mr. Antônio? -Yet? -Not yet. Mrs. Lana. What's does Third Force mean? Third Force? Yeah, it's written on your VW van. The VW van belongs to my brother's MMA school. Which brother? -Kiko. -Kiko? -Really, Kiko? -Kiko? What do you fight? -Oh my! -Jiu-jitsu. Jiu-jitsu! That's wonderful! Hi there, Cami girls. Today my dad will give you a speech. Tell us, dad. Did you take jiu-jitsu classes? It's been a while, I was young and very good at it. A while, indeed. Like 20 years ago, right? So, lad... Shall we try some movements? Come on. Let's do this. Come. Time to fight. Kiko! An honor to the family! What's going on? Out, out! Are you crazy? You'll hurt your back! -Up! Up! -It's okay. I'm okay, sweetie. Salvador, go straight to your room! Have you lost it? I'm sorry, guys. Numbnuts took him down. Save by the bell, Kiko. The rain has stopped. Let's go, mamma. So soon? It might get worse. I think you should stay for the night. -Right? -You're so kind. Mrs. Lana can stay in the guestroom. -Really? -Right next to mine. Okay? The boys can stay in Vicente's old bedroom. It's already disinfected. -Jesus, grandpa. That's awful. -I'm just kidding. And Fernando can stay with Mario. Is that okay, son? Sure, dad. It's okay. It's settled then. Let me show you the rooms. Okay. Do it, girl Yell! Playing mute is the worst. Lana must be so proud of us. We nailed it. Look. -Don't twist your wrist. -Check. -Shoulders up. -Check. -Kiko plays mute. -Check. I can't believe it! We did it! -We were great! -They were clueless. We're real actresses. "And Fernando can stay with Mario." What about that brother-in-law? He was like, "I'll show you my leglock later." -He's so hot! -Focus, friend. Come and give me a massage. -Posing as a man is awful! -Is it? Slowly. Come on, relax and breathe. You gotta breathe to relax. It'll be good for you. I brought you some towels. "I brought you some towels." Dinner will be served in one hour. Hi. You missed this, didn’t you? -Yeah. -Did you? It was so cute of your dad to put me in your bedroom. See? He knows and he's fine with it. Just tell him. He's fine with it? If he knew there's a gay community in his house, he'd drop dead. I mean it. -Don't laugh. -This is so absurd! How could he believe Kiko and Xande were straight? And Lana a worried mamma? It's absurd. Thank you for being here. Things get confusing when you are not around. I love you. I just can't not to be around you. I missed you so much. Me too. Your love dragged me And you dragged me along -Kiko! -Kiko! You knocked me out You made me go crazy What the hell? -We were just... -Who's singing? Who could it be? -Kiko! -No. -Where? -Just go. Downstairs? No, no, no. It's not coming from there. It's coming from the bathroom. -The bathroom. -I can hear it too. What, guys? Karate Kid! Is your voice back? The hot bath must have helped. Right! And what a voice! Would you sing some more? Well, I'm not quite... I'm not okay. So... I'll go now. -Bye. -He's still hoarse. And what about you, in your underwear? -What? -We were working out. -Lifting some weight. -We gotta finish it, okay? I could use some exercise. Your love dragged me And you dragged me along I'm gonna drag this damn queer to hell! Kiko, are you nuts? Stop with the singing! All night I'm... What the hell? What the hell? Good evening. Sleep well. Lana, did you hear that? I heard nothing. Nothing. -Is there a larger one? -Hey! You and I are alike. I fancy the larger ones. And the longer and thicker ones. Here, dear. This is how you do it. There you go. Fernando? Here. Your mother is a special woman. Yeah, real special. Real special! Excuse me. Excuse me! The roach is here. -The punch, daddy. -Hi. Hi, good evening. Diane? No. It's Ana. Diane Von Furstenberg. Your dress. My girlfriend has one. Well, then she has good taste. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt your party. -You're not. -Don't worry. Darling, you're not interrupting anything. We were the ones who showed up unnoticed -to visit Mario. -Yeah. Oh, sure! So you must be Fernando. And she's the bagger? Bagger? I never... -Fernando is your boy... friend. -From college. -Exactly. -From college? Mario told me amazing things about you. What a coincidence! He told me great things about you. Good! Then we'll be friends. I'm sorry to show up like this, but I need to talk to Mario. -Is that okay? -Absolutely! -Let's go outside. -Five minutes. Let's go that way. Yeah. -Go on. -Hi, gorgeous. -I needed to talk to you. -Okay. -I read your book. -Already? I read it a few times. And I'm dying to show you this. Mario, I'm in love with it. It's so promising. There's still a lot to do, I made a few notes for you. You refer to Vizma in the first paragraph, you could do that throughout the story. -"Rewrite it with emphasis on..." -The Barth dialectic. Have you read it? Read it. Oh, look. -"Excellent." -This page is excellent, Mario! You are very talented! -Ana... -What? No one has ever been this honest and sensitive. Thanks. Good! So you liked it? -I loved it. -So, there's a chapter... -Hey. -Yeah? I know it sounds crazy... I can't stop thinking about you. I don't know why. I just can't. I can't stop thinking about you too. Wonderful! What a beautiful scene! I'm not directing it, but it's so appealing! -Nando? -What? -I just... -Just what? You were wrong. I mean, she's not a bagger. I think I'll let you talk and I'm gonna leave. No, bagger. I'm the third wheel. -Excuse me. -No. Fernando! -Look, Fernando. -What? Nothing happen. Nothing. -Nothing happened? -No. Oh nothing happened. Everything is fine. Perfect! Sorry, guys. I'm overreacting. My bad. No! Everything happened! What the...? Now she... she is your consultant? -About the things you write? -No. -Can I see it? -It's not... Proofreading by Ana Melo. Nice name. Really, this is great! "Perfect?" But it can improve. Look, Nando... What happened was an accident. I didn't ask her to do this, she just did it. -I think you... -I didn't... Back from the top? Shall we? This movie isn't mine. Excuse me. But you're great actors. Wonderful. Why don't you jump from the balcony and die? Enjoy it. I thought you'd like it. But I did. Bagger! You're jealous! Nando. Wait. Wait. Let's talk. Hear me out. I'll run over you! Ana. Ana, listen to me. Let's talk. We can talk, but not now. I shouldn't have come. And the girl? She left. Fernando? He left. Together? Mario, Mario... Listen. Just because you're ruining your relationship, and the life of the crew, and of those who backed you up, doesn't mean you feel guilty, right? No. -No, absolutely. -Right. First I must give my father a heart-attack, then I'll feel guilty. Don't. Don't kill him. Leave him to me. Look. He's not exactly a golden ticket, but I do fancy sauerkraut. Don't be like that... -Lana... -It'll pass. It'll pass, you'll see. I'm sorry. Good evening, Mr. Celso. Hi, Valquíria. -Good evening. -Thank you. Whiskey, please. Neat. I'll have the same. Double. But on the rocks, please. Antônio. -Are you cold, Lana? -Thanks. -Can I call you Lana? -Sure. Of course. You know, Lana. I'm a little upset. And I could use a good friend. You know? My... My son Vicente, you haven't met him, he... I found out that he is... Anyway, he's gay. -Antônio. -Yeah. Well, it happens. Right? I keep imagining two men kissing and making out... Some things we shouldn't mention. Sweaty bodies tangling... So sweet... I mean, weird. Declaring their love with that deep voice. Antônio, please. Please! Let's avoid the temptation. That is, the probation. I'm sorry. But not you... You're different. A different kind of woman. There's something about you... Oh! Really? That's a way of putting it. You are astonishing. Antônio, you have no idea. I haven't met someone like you in a long time. Antônio, stop it. I'm shy. Daddy? Daddy! I was wondering, maybe I can give them a ride to the hotel. -What do you think? -Salvador? Don't call me "daddy". -You stay here, Salvador. -Yes, stay with Bianca. I can drive them myself. But I... I... I couldn't even know your technique better. Sorry. A fly. Jiu-jitsu is so fascinating, isn't it? We should get going. You can show him your grips and chokes another time. That would be great! I haven't seen it yet. Oh, you sure have. It's just another name for things. -Get in, Salvador. -Come on. I'm glad to hear you'll stay a few more days. Brüderlich's Annual Party is coming. And I insist that you... I mean all of you to be there. And I won't take no as an answer. -Bye. -Bye, Antônio. Thank you so much. Good evening. Before that, you'll eat my carreteiro rice. And you'll love it. -Mamma loves carreteiro. -Does she? Good to know. -Goodbye, then. -Bye. Good evening. -Merci. -Bye bye. "Before that you'll eat my carreteiro. You'll love it." I liked you better when you were mute! I found you in a maelstrom Where are you, my love? Oh dear! Did you just see that divine being? Can someone pinch me? I can pinch you all right. Now move quietly. No, no, no. Guys, that was not an ordinary man, okay? That was a gift I've been asking for Gay Fairy for ages! But it's not yours, sassy. I saw him first. -Back off! -Listen. Take your giant hands off my boo, got it? He'll fall for my jiu-jitsu. I'll show you my version of jiu-jitsu, you whore! Quiet, you two. Before they threw us out! Go! Can't sleep? Hey. Yummy! Bianca, I'm gay. -I know. -What? -I figured it out. -Really? Why didn't you say something? And say what? You like men. Vicente too. I wondered if maybe I were gay too. And? I'm not gay. Okay. You're into Fernando, right? Right. But he's jealous of Ana. Should he? Ana is the most arrogant, like super arrogant... And she... And she's also free, honest and she makes me feel things that... That I never felt before. New things are always scary. Grandma. Take a seat. Look at all this sugar! -Mario did it. -I went overboard. -You did. -Here's a strudel, grandma. Thank you. Grandma... is it possible to love two people at the same time? Everything is possible, dear. Bianca. You should manage the brewery. -Me? -Of course! You've always been the strongest of us. You still are. I tried. It's not my thing. I have a plan. Wow! Tell us, grandma. Tomorrow. When we wake up. Good morning, sunshine. Morning. -I didn't mean to wake you... -It's okay. I gotta go. Hey!

Dad gave me an urgent task. It's so urgent, that maybe you should do it. I'm not daddy's right-hand for nothing. What is the task, anyway? The new beer barrels. -Beer barrels? -Yes. We need to know the exact number. And you know why? Because dad suspects his supplier may be lying. Exactly. I'm on it. Hi. Well, now we can start. There's one person missing. Who? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I had this... What? I'm sorry I'm late. I get a little frightened whenever I'm late. That's why I screamed. I'd like to thank you all for coming. Now we can start. I give the floor to Mario. Before we start, I'd like to introduce Vicente and Fernando. He's the one I told you about. Fernando, Vicente is my oldest brother. -Sure. -I'm very... It was great. It's my pleasure. -How are you? -Great. You look great. Nice to meet you. Well, I know I had some issues with some of you, most of you, but grandma Helena and I have a proposition for you.

I'll present you a new concept for Brüderlich. 742. 876. 931. 1,113. 1,500.. 1,511. This is our project. Brülich Pink it's a beer with an idea. "Be brave to be happy." Thank you. So, let me get this straight. You want my help to produce the pink beer here at Brüderlich, behind dad's back, to sell it to gay customers, and launch it at the annual party with your management? Exactly. Damn! Even though I'm a... How did you put it? An ignorant hillbilly and... son of a bitch? -Vicente... -Huh? I overreacted and I was rude to you. -Quite rude. -I'm sorry. Vicente. Yes, grandma? This is your chance to stay in the company and keep with your dream of modernization. And you want my help to launch the beer, despite... Despite your recent actions and side by side with your partner in crime? Think hard before making up your minds. These personal problems will be sorted out eventually. Even before the launch. Fernando, what do you say we do it for the greater good? Much greater. Mario told me how good you are, we need you to produce the launch campaign. So what do you say? Well, I'm in! But I'd like to hear Bianca's opinion. Please. Well, I think... I'm in because grandma asked. That's the only reason, okay? And you couldn't do it alone. -But I think... -I'm in! It'll be good for Third Force. -But we should... -I'm so glad you agreed. You won't regret it. We just need to decide... What's the use of being gay if you won't let a woman speak? Uh? I'm in. But... the formula is mine. 10,149. 10,150. Why didn't you tell me you were Mario's brother? -Me? -Yeah. Why didn't you tell me you were his boyfriend? Yeah, we failed on the talking part. We failed on many things. -Your carreteiro, ma'am. -Thank you. Antônio, I'll finally eat your carreteiro. I'm sure you'll love it. I never saw a lady eating a carreteiro with such... elegance. You're the first. Bee, boo, bae, big, bae, bae, bae, bae -Bae! -Bae? -Bae? -Bae. Bae. -Hi, Vicente. -Hey. Let me introduce you to the crew. -Hi. -This is Vicente Brüderlich. Mario's brother.

A run-of-the-mill. -A match! -A match! -Xande... -No. -We're a match. -Not happening. Hi! What are you up to? Hunting. I'm afraid this one -is big. -Big. -Exactly. This is more delicate. -I like it.

I want your opinion. -Pink beer? -Just taste it. Oh, dear. Okay. It's good. I knew it. Breakfast is served. PLUSES AND MINUSES OF A THROUPLE THREESOME POLYAMORY READY FOR A THREEWAY? NEW WAYS OF... Hi. Hi. Hi. -You good? -Good. -What is that? -What? Let me see. -Nothing... -Let me. The advertising script. -I'll rehearse it, okay? -Okay. "You know I'm not a resolute guy. Man 1: "I just want you to acknowledge our love. Is it too much to ask?" Man 1: "Asking can be much when talking about love." "Should I earn that love, then?" Because I know you want me. And now you want a kiss. That's not in the script. I'm improvising. I'm not good at improvising. What are you good at? Ana, I wish things were simpler. Things are simple, Mario. You know what that is? Prejudice for me being a woman. Because if I were a man, we'd have settled it ages ago. Mario! -What's... -Hey. The script. -For your rehearsal. -We'll do the dance. -But doesn't it follow...? -Get the script. I need your help with the choreography. The boys have a question. We need you there. No? Can we do that? -I can. -Can you? -Sure. Then we can... Go then... and dance. One, two, three, four. Together! Hand down. Slowly. Slowly. Slowly. Counterweight. Up! Push! Back. Up ahead.

This scene was fabulous. And I wasn't directing it. -I was the clown. -Calm down. -Let go of me. -Let's talk in my office. -What do you want? -Chill. Let's talk in my office. First the intolerant family, now her? Ana. My name's Ana. You wanna know what I want? Okay. I'll tell you. -I don't know what I want! -Me neither! Look. When I left you that night, -I met someone else. -What? What are you talking about? Mario. I didn't know he was your boyfriend. -I didn't know. -I didn't know he was your brother. But it happened, you know? Look at what we're doing to each other. Lana. Boys. I... I trust you. I know you'll do your best. -Nando... -But... Don't. Nando. I'll get some water. And I'll eat something. -Mario, let me... -Don't. Not now. Mario. Calm down, Mario. What a mess! Vicente, don't... Calm down. We're all stressed out. We're all stressed out. Tell me. I screwed it up. I thought I was... handling the situation, but... When the time comes, I never know what to do. I don't know what to do. Yeah, that's true. I remember when mom asked you to pick the prettiest flower in the garden, and it took you an entire day to pick one. -I remember that. -Yeah. Mario. We should chose what makes us happy. Only you'll know what it is. Look. That pastry is good, but the flight to Rio leaves at 20 pm. Look what you did! -Love you. -Love you. -Lana. -Mario. -What are you doing here? -Your father invited me. -Okay, I need a ride now. -Where to? The airport. We have two hours. -Come on. -Okay. Mario! -Hurry! -I'm good at driving. Come on, Lana! Honey, did you forget that I'm a pilot? -Then go! -Let's go! Come on! Hit the gas! -Are we there yet? -No, we're getting there. -Lana, are we there yet? -Calm down. Almost there. -Lana, are we there or what? -Dammit, boy. Knock it off! Nando! Nando! Out of the way, dammit! -Go! Go! -Nando! Nando! Son of a bitch! Just a second. I must talk to him. -I can't... -What the hell, Mario? I know I screwed up! I know I screwed up, and you hate when I get insecure and hesitant, but... our life... My life with you in it it's much happier. Please, don't go. I don't feel this emotional since Alfredo had a heart-attack. Alfredo had a heart attack? I'm being brave to do what you can't. Excuse me. Fernando! Fernando! Now I'm confused. Who's she? Hi, I'm Ana. That's polyamory, Clotilde. If only I knew polyamory back in my days. What's going on? -I'm here to talk to you. -What now? Do I look like a laundromat to do your laundry? I'm not here to talk about Mario. I'm here to talk about you. Because you're essential to this project. Our cause is bigger than that. Listen to me. It isn't about you. But an entire generation that grew up with their queers in the closet. Right, friend? And now they'll come out, Fernando. Peeing pink across the nation. Fernando, pink beer is a liberating. Pink beer is the key. Stay here. Look... I don't know if I can forgive and forget. But of course I'll stay. I'll stay. But I'll need a refund for my ticket. Guys, clear the hall. I'm a diva, darling! Guys! What's this? Hey, sir! Janaína? Janaína! Sir? Bring me an eggnog mixed with black beer. Dear God, why? Why do I even try? Gosh, you nag! What are you nagging about? I'm also going to the party. Can't you see I'm getting ready? -You look beautiful. -Thank you. Excuse me. -Looking fabulous. -Thank you. Excuse me. So, daddy. How are you? Salvador, my son, let's talk. Son? I... I'm glad to see your excitement for the annual party, daddy. But that's not the only reason. It's not? You have news? Tonight, I'll ask Lana to be my girlfriend. Daddy going back to action after all these years... So? -Do you think I can't do it? -No, no. -No, no. -Salvador. Do you think Bianca and Mario will be against it? I think they'll respect your choice. Because they want to see you happy. -Grandpa. -Yes, sweetie. And you should want the same for Uncle Vicente. BE BRAVE TO BE HAPPY Now we have to convince dad. Do you know your speech? This is great! So fabulous! Hi! Lana and the boys are getting ready. Guys, this is going to be huge. -Incredible! -Let's hope so! You guys are amazing! Mom? Mom? We'll be late. Come on. In a minute, son. Janaína, pour me some whiskey. Some or some? Some! Good evening, everyone. Thank you. I'm happy to see you all here for the annual party. It's a little different this year. Because we have a few surprises for you. Why is Mario on the stage? -Hi. -Hello. What can you tell us about Brüderlich's pink beer? Pink beer? Yes, the first beer dedicated to the gay community in Brazil. Gay? -Brülich Pink. -Gay? -It's message... -Will you excuse me? "Be brave to be happy." Wait, wait, wait! Vicente... This could only be your idea. Is this a revenge? Not everything is about you. It was my idea. Mr. Antônio, your children are amazing. Look around you. It's a success. I knew this coach thing was a scam. This lady will ruin my company. -My company. -Mom! Salvador? -Take everyone out. -Daddy, calm down. You too, Bianca? Lana. Have you seen what they did? What they did? Come on. Antônio, you have to accept your children for who they are. Will she convince him? And we rehearsed for nothing? Have you seen her fail before? Antônio, the world has changed. People change. I've changed. Dad. I led the project. I know it'll be difficult for you. Okay? We all know. But it's okay. In times like these, when you least expect it, you meet someone who changes everything, who believes in you, who gives you a little push to make you believe in yourself. And look at it, dad! It's beautiful! Dad, you always believed that I lived in Rio to study Business and get an MBA. I didn't. I came back here to tell our family who I really am and what I'm passionate about. I'm a writer, dad. Say what? I write plays, dad! Plays performed by Lana, Kiko and Xande. And that are wonderfully directed by Fernando. Say what? By the way, I should say that Fernando was the one who understood me, and made me happy all those years in Rio. Dad, I... I love people. Not gender. Say what? I love Ana and I love Fernando. What are you saying? Hey, Fernando. Didn't you have a girlfriend? So, he was the... -The... -Dad. One more thing. The formula of the new beer is mine. You always say that the essence is more important than the label. Forget the labels, dad. What's the problem of us being gay? Your sons will always be your sons. And you, dad? You'll always be our dad. If there's one thing that I'm proud of... Please, listen. I'm really proud of the way I raised my children. They're brave. They fight for what they want. I won't prevent you from doing anything. Give me a hug. Come here. Give me a hug.
