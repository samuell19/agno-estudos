Hi, this is Gracie. How can I help you tonight? Yeah hi, I need you to tell me what you're wearing. What do you want me to be wearing, honey? I'm paying for this shit. You tell me. I don't like you. Where's the one I spoke to last night? You have reached the Seattle Bay Foster Care Programme. All our case workers are busy right now but please do leave a message and we will call you right back. Yeah hi, this is Gracie Blake. I need to speak to somebody about my daughter, Kayla. She's staying with the Curtis family in Medicine Park. I need to talk about my visitation times. Can someone call me back please? Thank you. I was just wondering, do you do home visits? What do you mean? Would you come to my apartment? No. In a normal situation we'd be happy to spread your payments, Miss Blake. But you haven't paid us for three months, so I'm afraid my hands are a little tied. Look, I'm trying to do this right, okay? I wanna get this stuff straight but I don't have any money right now. Well then I'm afraid we'll need to cancel your contract. I need this phone for my job. Okay. We will be prepared to give you one more month to pay these arrears, Miss Blake, before termination. Hello Gracie, it's Peter. Who? It's Peter. We spoke yesterday. Jesus Peter, hi. How did you get this number? I need to speak to you now. It's urgent. Okay. I'm in Seattle. What? Why? To see you. Fuck Peter, I said I don't do personal visits. I know, I know. I need to see you, Gracie, in the flesh. What would that cost me? Look, how much have you brought? Five grand. I can give you more if you... When do you want to do this? Tonight. - Hello? Hello? This isn't very funny! Hello! Fuck. What? Hello? Hello, Gracie. - Why, who is this? It's me, it's Peter. - Peter, look I'm sorry I can't talk right now. I have to... You don't remember last night then? - What? No. No, why should I? Look, what the fuck is going on? I'm sorry it had to be a secret. I didn't think you'd come on your own. - A fucking secret? How the fuck did you get me here? - Just some chloroform, nothing dangerous. - Why, Peter? It's a little hard to explain. - Yeah, you've locked me in a fucking animal cage. I know. I need to keep you there for a while. Look, just don't panic, okay? - Oh, why though Peter? What for? Are you going to kill me? I'm not going to kill you, no. Nothing will happen if you don't call the police. Don't worry. - So it's sex then. Well, look, I don't know. - Okay, Peter, this is freaking me out. If it's sex then just tell me and we can do it and I can go. We can discuss this all very soon. I've gotta go now, I've got a plane to catch. - Wait no, no, no please wait, wait. What? - I have these pills I need to take, and I've run out and I really need them. What are they? - They're called um, divalproex. I really need them. - I'll see what I can do, ah dival? - Yeah, D-I-V-A-L, thank you. You're welcome. - How long do I need to stay here for? Not long. Look, there's enough food and water for a week. And Gracie, you can have your phone. Just don't call the police. - A fucking week? Don't call the police. They won't be able to track you there. - Okay. So what am I supposed to do now? Just wait. - Shit. Fuck! Fuck! Could someone help me? Hey you. - Hey honey, how's it going? Yeah, okay. Shit at work, unless I can keep up with these hours. Boss got me on Tuesday night working and I really... - Eddy. What? - I need to tell you something, and I need you not to get pissed, okay? Um, okay. - A client came to my apartment. Jesus fucking Christ, Grey, why? - It doesn't matter. It fucking does matter. Did you have sex with him? - No. I don't know. You don't know. Jesus, that's a new one. - I know, I know, and I'm sorry, but you've got to listen to me. Sorry, yeah. But why, what now? - He drugged me. What? - He drugged me and I don't know what happened last night. Fuck. - He's got me locked in this kind of prison place. Prison, where? - That's the thing, I don't know. Is it in the city or? - I don't know. Who is this guy? - He's called Peter. He's the new one I told you about. Shit. Have you called the cops? - No, I can't. Well, he told me not to. He said he's coming, so I'm just going to see what he wants. Can you not get out? - No. Why? I'm chained up. What? - Please, leave it to me. And don't tell Mom. I mean, she called earlier asking if you were with me. - Well, next time say I am. Say I'm asleep or something. Okay, I'll try. - I don't want to tell her about this shit. It's fine, okay. I'll see you tomorrow. No, I'll come and find you. - I don't know where I am, Eddy. Hey, Mom. Hey, honey, how are you? - Yeah, I'm good. How about you guys? Oh, we're okay. Tried to call you last night and you weren't there. Tried Eddy, but he didn't know where you were either. - Mom, I'm 27 years old. Taylor's band were playing at Stories, I was down there. Oh. So what are you up to today, honey? - Oh, not much. I had that dream again last night, Mom. You know, with the crying. Oh, are you taking your pills? - Yeah. I really miss her, Mom. Oh, I know you do, dear. We all do. You what Dr. Meadows said though. - I know, but she doesn't know what it's like. She's a very good doctor, Grayson. The people from the foster care centre said they'd look at your case. She said the pills will make you less emotional. - I don't want to be less emotional. She was my daughter. I just want her back. - Please don't, Gracie. You'll start me off. How's Eddy dealing with it? - Yeah, he seems better than me. But, you know, he's a guy, he doesn't talk. You seeing him tonight? - No, I don't think so. Well, I think you need to be with someone tonight. I'll get your father to drive over and pick you up. I'll make brownies. - No, I can't tonight. Why, what are you doing? - I just can't. Why are you being so strange with me? I know when there's something wrong. You're still my daughter, remember. - I just want to be alone tonight. - Oh. - I'll be okay. Don't just sit in getting drunk. - I won't, Mom. Look, I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Make sure you do. I love you, honey. - I love you too. It'll be okay, you know? - Thanks. Say hi to Dad for me. Will do. Bye. - Love you. Bye. - Bye. - Hi. Hi, it's me. What's going on? - Nothing. I'm still here. I spoke to Mom. Was she okay? - I guess. I mean, she knew something was wrong. Look, if she calls you again, just say I'm with you and I've gone to sleep, okay? I called the cops. - And what did they say? All they said, well they asked how long you've been missing and they said you needed to be gone for like 48 hours before they start looking. - Jesus, did you tell them what happened? Yeah, but look, they said this sort of shit is not unusual. - Not fucking unusual? Yeah, for people in your line of work. - What do you mean? Well, okay, they asked me what you did for a living, so. - What did you tell them, Eddy? Look, I said you were, I mean I told them you were a prostitute. I don't think it helped. - I'm not a prostitute! Jesus, will you just think about things before you say them? Gracie, you fucked some guy who's chained you up in a cage. - Just think about Kayla and getting her back. Okay. - So what happens now? Look, the police said they would look into it after 48 hours. So tomorrow sometime I guess. Have you got any idea where you are? - I'm near an airport. You have no new messages and one saved message. To hear your saved message, press 1. Hi honey, it's your mom. Everything's fine here. She's having a lovely time with Grandpa. Kayla, come say hello to Mommy. She's having a great day. Okay, gotta go. Bye, Mommy. Say bye, Mommy. - Someone help me! Is that you? What? What the fuck do you want? Gracie, calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down, you fucking piece of fucking shit. Just let me out of here. I can't do that yet. - When then? I'm in Florida right now and I'm flying back soon. Would you like me to come and see you? - Peter, I really need my drugs. I really fucking need them. Have you got them? I think I know a guy who can get some. I'll let you have them when I'm back. - Why are you in Florida? Just work. Apart from the pills, how are you? Really? How do you think? What is this, Peter? Huh? - If you would just be honest with me, it would be easier. I need to let my family know when I'm going to be home. I'm just a normal man, Gracie. I just need this. - What? I need to have this going on. - So I'm not the first person you've done this to? Oh God, yeah. Of course. There's no one else. Just you. - Well, I'm flattered. I'm just a normal man, Gracie. - So what is this then, Peter? Is it just a sexual thing? Look, it's a little more complicated than that. - You can be honest with me, I don't mind. Why didn't you just go on the, you know? Find a nice girl who's into bondage and stuff. Yeah, because they grow on trees, don't they? - I'm into it. Well maybe when this is over, you could be my girlfriend. Yeah, great first date. Look, I'm back soon, so I'll try and come and see you. - Look Peter, I really want to see you. But you have to promise to bring my medication, okay? I won't be much fun without it. Okay, okay. Thanks, Gracie. You sit tight there. Oh, and Gracie. - Yeah. If I were to bring along some clothes later. Oh look, it doesn't matter. - What sort of thing? I don't know. I'm into different stuff. - Yeah, sure. Size six. Really? - Look, let's talk tomorrow. We can work this out. Okay. - Peter? Hm? - Can I take this chain off my leg, please? Oh look, I don't know. Let's see tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. See you tomorrow. Bye. Hi, you've reached Sandra and Bob Blake. We're not home right now, so please leave a message. - Hey, Mom, it's me. I'm just calling to say, hey, and I'm feeling a lot better. I'm seeing Eddy tomorrow, but maybe we can hook up after? Anyway, I gotta go. Say hi to Dad for me. Love you. Bye. Hey. - It's me. Have you spoken to him? - Yeah. Look, I think I might be okay. Really, how? - Well, I basically had to tell him that I'd be his girlfriend when he lets me out of here. And he bought that? - Yeah. He seemed to be getting pretty excited about it on the phone. What a loser. He was probably jerking his little cock off while you spoke to him. - Yeah. That's what he does. Look, any news on finding me? Yeah. The cops have added you to the database and I mentioned the airport. - So, what are they doing? Grey, we don't even know what state you're in. It's going to be really tough. You need to call them so they can track your cell. - No, it's okay. I can do it alone. Look, I gotta go. I want to preserve this battery. Okay, I love you. - I love you too. Bye. - Hi. Hello, Gracie. - How was your flight? Delayed. - Are you okay? I'm fine. - Did you manage to get my pills? Yes. I have them right here. - Why are you being weird with me? I look forward to seeing you later. It's going to be fun. Enough, Gracie. Enough. - Peter, why are you being like this? I've had a stressful time, okay? I don't like being fucked about. - Who's fucking you about? Everyone is a fucking liar. - What? I'm not going to be back tonight. More likely tomorrow morning now. I'm going to be tired. You're not going to fuck me about, are you Gracie? - No, of course not. You said we'd have sex. Is that still happening? - Yeah, if you stop talking to me like that. I'll talk to you anyway I want. You're the one chained up in a cage, aren't you? - You're really not great with women, are you? Look, just give me my pills and I promise you can do whatever you want. You better keep that promise. - Threats now. Yeah. Hi, you've reached Sandra and Bob Blake. We're not home right now, so please leave a message. - Hey Mom, it's me. Pick up if you're there. I'm just calling to say, hey. Gracie, Gracie, it's me. I'm here. - Shit, Mom, what's up? It's your father. They took him in an ambulance. - Why, what happened? Well, he said, he said he felt ill at dinner. And I think he's had a heart attack. - Mom, is he okay? I'm so scared, Grey. - Okay, calm down. What did the ambulance guy say? Nothing. They took him straight away. They gave him those electric shock things. - Are you going to go to hospital? I had a glass of wine at dinner. I can't drive. Will you come and take me in? I want you with me. - No Mom, just, just get a cab, okay? I'll be there as soon as I can. Which hospital was he at? He's at Northwest. - Okay, I'm out of town, so I'm going to be a little while, okay? Well, where are you? - Eddy and I took a little trip to see his parents. Please come back, honey. - Yeah. Look, give Dad a big hug from me. I love you. I love you too. 911, what's the nature of your emergency? - Hi, I've been kidnapped and I'm in a cage. Okay, can I please take your name? - Yeah, it's Gracie. Gracie Blake. Can you tell me when this happened, Gracie? - Three days ago. Look, there should be someone looking for me. Do you know the identity of the person who kidnapped you? - His name's Peter, but that's about it. And do you know where you're being kept? - No, but it's near an airport, I think. In Seattle? - No, that's the thing. And look, my boyfriend, Eddy Morano reported me, okay? There should be someone looking for me. Can you just trace this call? Miss Blake, I'm going to put you through to Missing Persons. Missing Persons, Detective Moss. - Hi, my name is Gracie Blake. I think you're looking for me. Okay, just let me get my system up and running. What was the name again, please? - Gracie, Gracie Blake. Ah yeah, missing since the third. Can you tell me where you are, Miss Blake? - No, that's the thing. This guy, he came and he drugged me, and he locked me in a fucking cage. Okay, okay, so talk me through what happened on the night of the abduction. - Why can't you just tell me if you can find me? If you give me all the facts, we'll have a much better idea of where to start. - There's this guy, his name's Peter, okay? I don't know his last name. He came to my apartment and he drugged me. He used chloroform. So you know this man? - No, no, no. He's a client of mine, okay? I never met him before this. And is he there now? - No, he's not been here. He phones me. He says he's in Florida. Florida? - Yes, Florida. He said he's coming back tonight. Can you please check the flights or something? Leave all that to us. You said he's a client. What line of work, Miss Blake? - Chat lines, okay? I'm not a prostitute. Okay, can you explain? - Guys, they call me and they jerk off while I talk to them, okay? I don't want to do it, but I have to. Miss Blake, I don't care what you do. I just want to find you. Now can you describe where you're being held? - Ah, it's like a big warehouse. It's made of metal and it's a dome shape. And are there any windows you can see out of? - No, but I think I'm near an airport, like really near. Okay, thank you. Now we're going to run this information through our system, see if it matches anywhere in the Seattle area. And we can also run a trace on the call. Can I call you back on this number? - Yeah, no, no, no, no. I need to get out of here. I need to see my dad, he's in hospital and I really need to see him. Okay, we're going to do all we can. I'll call you back soon. You need to remain calm. Are you okay to do that? - Can you just get me out of here? Just somebody help me please? - No, no, no! Fuck! ♫ If you fell for me ♫ I would make sure that I kept you clean ♫ How does it feel ♫ When will we breathe ♫ If shooting stars are wished upon ♫ How long will it be til we run for the sun - Fucking asshole. He's fucking filming me? Fucking pervert. Fuck this! Peter. Please let me out of here. If you let me out of here, I promise I'll never say a thing to anyone. I need to see my dad. He's had a heart attack and he's in hospital. I know you said you need to keep me here, but this is really important. I might not see my dad again. And I don't want to die in here without saying goodbye. Look, my dad's rich, okay? He'll pay you if you let me out of here. Please let me out of here. Please. Dear God. Please look after my dad for me. He's sick. Please make him better. Please look after my mom too. If you can her I love here, that would be good. If you've taken my dad already, then can you tell him me and Kayla love him. Kayla, I'm so sorry I let them take you. Oh God, if you want to take me too, then that's fine. Amen. Help. Help! I'm in here. Miss Blake, it's Detective Moss with the Missing Persons team. Are you alone? - Yes, yes, please help me! Okay, we need to force the door. Stay calm, it's going to be okay. - Yes. We're getting some equipment to open it. - Thank you, thank you, God. We know about your father, Gracie. - Is he okay? He's dead, Gracie. Yes, dead. - No. Dead. Dead, dead, dead, dead. Fuck. Hello. - Mom, it's me. Oh God, Gracie. Where are you? Where the hell have you been? - Mom. Jesus Christ, have you got any idea how worried we've been, Gracie? But why do you do this? - I'm sorry, okay? Why do you constantly let us down? You let everyone down. How do you think your father has felt you not turning up? - Is he okay? You let your daughter down too, you know? You do know that, don't you? - Mom, just stop, okay. I need to tell you something. It's me. Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling for days. - I know, don't start. Look, I'm sorry, okay? Are you out? - No. Then why the fucking silence, then? - He took my phone. What, why? - I called the cops and he punished me. But I got it back now, and my pills. He punished you? God. If I ever meet this fucking guy? - Did you hear about my dad? Yeah, of course I have. Your mom's been on the phone to me like every five minutes asking where you are. - What did you tell her? I said I didn't know. Jesus Grey, what are we going to do now? - I don't know. I can't have her knowing about this, not with my dad. I get it. - Look, I gotta go. Battery. Okay. I love you, honey. I'll call the cops. They should have tracked your cell by now. - Love you too. Hello. Gracie, it's me. - What do you want? Look, I'm sorry about the phone. If I'd known about your dad I would have returned it earlier. But I was away. - How do you know about that? The same way I knew you'd called the police. I told you not to do that, Gracie. - What do you expect me to do? I know, I know. Look, I've charged your cell so we can keep talking. - Peter, you have to let me out of here now. It's not finished. Well, hello stranger. - Hey Dad, how are you? Yeah, not too bad. How are you? I got to lie down for three days straight, so that's good. - I'm fine. It sounds relaxing. Oh, it is. So your mom's told me you were in Europe. That sounds like a fun trip. - Yeah, it's been amazing. Some great cities. So, you've been in London? We loved it there. Where are you now? - Spain. Flying home though soon though, Dad, to see you. Don't you come home on my behalf. You kids enjoy yourselves. - Let's not skirt around the subject, Dad. How's the ticker? Yeah, it's seen better days, I think. The doctors give me 10 to live. - 10 what? Nine, eight, seven, six. So when can you come home? I've got more tests in the morning. - What for? You'll have to ask your mom. More tubes in places tubes ain't supposed to be. - Ouch. You get better, Dad. I'll see you soon, okay? Love you. Yeah, okay honey. You guys have a great time. Don't you worry about me. Oh, and do you want to speak to your mom? - Yeah, sure. She says she doesn't want to speak to you, dear. Something about your annoying voice. Bob, stop it. Thanks for calling, dear. - Thanks, Mom. You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Love you. Bye. Hey Mom. Oh Gracie, I'm so sorry. - No, no. The hospital's called. - No, no, no, no, no! He's gone, I'm so sorry. No! I'm sorry, baby. He's gone. I'm so sorry. - Peter. If you're watching this or you can hear me, I need you to listen. I need to be with my family. My dad passed away last night and I need to be with my mom. I promise that if you let me go I will never say anything to anyone. And if anything does happen to you, I will stand up in court as a personal witness and I will tell them that you are not an evil man. You're not an evil man, Peter. Peter. Hello Gracie. - Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. I'm sorry about your dad, really sorry. - Thank you. Please let me go. This is difficult, Gracie. If I let you go, you need to give me time to disappear. - Of course. Anything you want. Just ask, just tell me. Okay, look. I'm not a monster. I know you think I am, but I'm not really. - It doesn't matter. If you let me go, I will be grateful forever. Okay, Gracie. I'm flying to San Francisco now. But I'll be in Seattle tomorrow morning. I'll knock on the door of the warehouse to let you know I am there. - Okay. But it would be better if you don't see me. When I knock, cover your head with your blanket. Do you understand? - Yeah, of course, of course. Thank you so much, Peter. You don't know what this means. Okay, okay. Look, I fly back into Seattle tomorrow at 8:30. Once I'm out of the airport, it will take me 15 minutes to get to you. - Thank you. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow. Oh Mom, pick up. Hi, you've reached Sandra and Bob Blake. We're not home right now, so please leave a message. - Hey Mom, it's me. Okay first off, I'm so sorry. Really I am. Things have been a bit crazy for me lately, but I'll explain everything when I see you. There was really nothing else I could do to get to you. Eddy's going to pick me up tomorrow and he's going to take me straight over. I'm sorry, Mom. I'll see you tomorrow. I love you. Bye bye. Hey, you've reached Eddy Morano. I'm either too busy or too lazy to pick up. Leave a message. - Hey, honey. It's me. I did it. I think I'm going to be okay. Call me back. I love you. I'm so sorry I missed your call. What's going on? - I spoke to Peter. He's going to let me go. Why? What did he say? - I told him about Dad. Look, I don't think this guy's a psycho, Eddy. He said he's going to let me go because of Mom. Where are you? - I'm in Seattle, I think. Okay, how do you know? - He said I'm about 15 minutes from SeaTac, so. Okay, shit. Should I call the cops, or? - No, no, no. Just get the car ready for the morning, and I'll call you when I'm out. Okay, great. I'll be waiting. Call me tonight if you need me. - Okay, gotta go. I want to preserve these batteries so I can call you tomorrow. Sure, okay. Good luck, honey. - See you soon. Yeah. You have one new voicemail message. Message from caller withheld at 6:58 on 11 September. Gracie, it's me, Peter. You have to listen to me carefully. I am on a plane and we have been hijacked. Three guys have hijacked us. People are saying that some planes have been flown into the World Trade Centre. I think we could be next, Gracie. They're turning us round. I need to talk to some other people, Gracie. But I have to say sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh God. I think it's happening. - No, no, no, no, no. Tell me where I fucking am. Peter, is that you? It's me. Why are you shouting? - He's been fucking hijacked. Who? - Peter has been fucking hijacked. I don't know what's going on, Eddy. It's fucking unreal. They've flown two planes into the World Trade Centre. Who? Terrorists I guess, and one into the Pentagon. - Why would Peter say that? What did he say? - He said he's been fucking hijacked just now. The news guy's saying another plane has been hijacked going to San Francisco. But don't worry, okay? I'll find you. - No, no, no, no, no. - You said you were in Seattle. Okay, I'm coming out now. I've got to go. Bye, bye, bye, bye. 911, please state the nature of your emergency. - My name is Gracie Blake. I'm on your missing persons list. Please can I speak to Detective Moss. I'm afraid all our officers are busy this morning. - No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. I need to speak to him, please. I am happy to take your number and pass it on, Miss Drake. - It's Blake. Excuse me? Fucking Blake. Can you please just put me through to him. Okay, I'll put you through. - Hey. Hi, it's me. Are you okay? - No. I'm not going to get out of here, am I, Eddy? Yeah, I'm going to get you out. I need you to describe the building you're in. - I've already described it to the police. Well then now you can describe it to me. - Metal. Okay. - It's like a big tin dome building. It's got a curved roof. Can you hear anything outside? - Only the planes. Even they've stopped now. Look, I'm going to work out what's 15 minutes from SeaTac and drive round. It's crazy. The two towers came down. - What, with people in them? Yeah, thousands. Look, I'm going to find you, I promise. - My battery's going to die soon, Eddy. What happens then? Don't worry, I'll find you. - Bye. I love you. - Tell my mom I love her. You can tell her that yourself. I'm coming to get you right now. Hello. Where are you? Why have you had your phone off? I'm still trying, I really am. - It doesn't matter.

Okay. We'll laugh about this one day, you know, when we're old. And tell the grandkids about the time that I rescued grandma. Okay, I'll only be five more minutes, okay? Did I mention that I'm taking you out to dinner tomorrow night? My treat, honest. Anywhere you want to go. Apart from the Chinese place. You know, we hate that place. Grey, are you there? - Yeah. Good, okay, I'm getting close. I'm going to be, hang on. Shit. I'm going to try and lose them, okay? Just stay with me, stay with me. Shit. No, no, no, don't be assholes. Ah shit, fuck. Come on, guys, don't be fucking assholes. Get out of the car, out of the car, sir. Get out of the car. I will not ask you again. I need you to find my girlfriend, guys. She's been kidnapped. She's on your database. You've got to listen to me. I need your help. On your knees, on your knees. I've got to find my girlfriend, guys. She's been kidnapped. Put your guns down.
