An address by the principal! Japanese Higher Education Graduation Ceremony Today An address by the principal! Today I address you on the auspicious occasion of your graduation. And the night prior to this auspicious occasion, which was last night, Crowded Train the university's auditorium and four other buildings... Produced by Hidemasa Nagata Screenplay by Natto Wada and Kon Ichikawa suddenly burned to the ground in a fire. Consequently, we had to hold the graduation ceremony in the schoolyard. We have also been visited upon by a rainstorm, Assistant director: Yasuzo Masumura Starring: Hiroshi Kawaguchi, Keizo Kawaguchi Eiji Funagoshi, Michiko Ono and although this poses some measure of hardship for our new graduates and guests, Chishu Ryu, Haruko Sugimura Bontaro Miake, Mantaro Ushio you are about to be released into a society where you will be... Yousuke Irie, Tatsuo Hanabu, Gen Shimizu Koichi Katsuragi, Kiwami Sazanka confronted by rain, wind, and storms, Koichi Ito, Fujio Harumoto, Koh Sugita Kanji Kawara, Kanzo Yoshii, Nobuo Minamikata and I believe this is an appropriate celebration... that will not soon be repeated. Eichi Takamura, Shiroyuki Miyashima, Koji Kosugi Kazuo Sumita, Masatoki Sasaki, Seiji Izumi I believe it highly unlikely that any of you... have been able to progress from the day you... matriculated into Peace University four years ago... until this day now by dint of your own tireless efforts and endurance. It is not possible to come this far under your own steam, but rather with the love and goodwill of countless people, some who you know and some who you don't. Directed by Kon Ichikawa And you owe a debt of gratitude to those innumerable people. You now find yourselves independent. Independence will mean that your wellbeing is no longer guaranteed. However, independence is comfortable. For, even when a man is impoverished, his freedom gives his life value. I can't get everyone in the photo. Still no good. Close your umbrellas. Close your umbrellas! What's wrong, did you catch cold? It's no surprise. No, this beer hurts my tooth. I've got another toothache. Don't feel obligated. I don't have a choice. This is a celebration. I'm jealous, Mr. Moroi: you're joining the workforce. Did you really land the job at Camel Beer without connections? Of course. You really studied hard. I'm not surprised that you went to a top university. I went to a third-tier school and my prospects... after graduating next year are bleak. You'll find a job somewhere. You'll be fine. No matter what company hires you, the outlook for a salaryman's life is always bleak. Mr. Moroi, these pants are part of your school uniform; let me have them. No, I'm going to wear them to work. - What about the jacket? - What'll you give me for it? They sell for 250 yen at the thrift store. No, they sell for 500 yen at the thrift store. - Let's say 350 yen? - 400 yen. All right. - A letter came from your dad in Odawara. - I read it. I need a favor. Pack up my futon and send it... to me once I know where I'm going to live. - Are you going already? - I have to be at work by 5:00. I have four days of training before my office is decided. Isn't it a little early? There's a matter I have to take care of before 5:00. You're such a go-getter, Mr. Moroi. Look, in Japan, there isn't going to be a seat open, just because you want to sit down. And that isn't an excuse just to mill around on a crowded train. You have to always be a go-getter. You can have the hibachi, the pot, and the kettle. I don't need them. Thanks. - Take care of yourself. - OK. Hey, Mr. Moroi, isn't that your diploma? I can't do any business in this crowded street! You're hurting my store! You're hurting my store! Rice crackers, please! Can I have some rice crackers? Dentist's Office Oh, you're still waiting! I haven't even had lunch yet. Come in. Hurry! We can only charge the measly fee stipulated by national health, so everyone comes. Shaddap! If I don't abide by NHI guidelines, no one will come. We're busy all the time and still don't make any money. You knucklehead, we can't survive if we don't have patients! Does that hurt? Did I hit a nerve? Does it hurt? Say something! Breaking up with you was the rational decision. I'll be starting a new life today, and I don't want to drag my student life alongside it. I want to make a clean break and that's all. I understand, but if we're to never see each other again, I'd like to at least have a cup of tea together first. I had hoped to, but now I don't have time. Once I start working, I doubt I'll be able to go out carousing like when I was a student. - That's not true. - Don't be angry. If I had time, I would explain, but... I just want to get a fresh start. It's not that I don't like you. In that case, it's OK. I can understand your feelings. Maybe we'll meet again sometime. Thanks for taking the time to say goodbye. "Son, I truly regret not being able to attend your graduation ceremony. "I'm very busy on the city council, "and I have a difficult time even just running the clock store. "Son, you are now a member of society. "I am sure you'll have no problem making a name for yourself. "Please come home to Odawara if you have a chance." Hey, Moroi, what are you doing? Hey, Iki. Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you. Were you at the graduation ceremony? - Of, course. I graduated. - I didn't see you there. Look, we were close for quite a while, but we're both starting... new lives, and I'd like to just let it be water under the bridge. I couldn't agree more. It was a trifling romance, and it seems unhealthy to drag it out. I don't want to bring my past feelings into my future. - Do you want a cup of tea? - No time. - Are you going somewhere? I leave on the 18:00 train from Ueno to my new job in... Iwate prefecture. I'm going to teach high school. I shouldn't have majored in Japanese literature. I wanted to work in Tokyo. - Women get the short end of the stick. - It's the same for men. I'll be in Kansai in Amagasaki City, on the other side of Osaka. At a beer company? Sweet gig. Are you leaving today? No, I'll be at the Tokyo head office for training first. What kind of job are you training for? I don't know. The bus is here. I'll be in the east and you'll be in the west. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Please make room for one more passenger! Please move back, everyone. Camel Beer Tokyo Headquarters This is the CEO, please send in the director of general affairs. Good morning, sir. I'm sorry I had to ask you to come in early for the first day of training... for the new employees, which we conduct every year. I believe most upper management are already here, but I'll take a quick look... - I summoned you for a reason. - Huh? - What is this? - The list of new employees. - Why are there ten? There are supposed to be three? Two regular hires and one hired through family and friends. Indeed, we hired the people you just mentioned... - Which is three. - The other seven were requested by upper management, as we discussed... I don't want favoritism to play a role in hiring. Personally, I oppose hiring people for their connections. Most of the time they're incompetent. We hired the nephew of the national bank at the request of standing director Tokugawa. We hired a relative of state minister Hosono at the request of standing director Toyotomi. One had connections to the Progressive Party Secretary at the request of director Idachi. Another was a major landowner from Hokkaido, at Uesugi's request. Takeda requested a man with connections to marine transport. Akechi's man is the politician Isobe's wife. We hired Orita's son. The company was not in a position to decline any of these requests. Sir, you approved all of these hires last Monday. I approved them? You're an idiot! You had me make such an important decision at such a time. That was the day I was frantically putting together the exclusive... import and domestic manufacturing and marketing licenses with Coca-pi. Fortunately, 10 people left last year, so there are openings for 10 new employees. Downsize! I want to reduce the head count. The Japanese beer market is saturated, and we are trying to expand our product lines and reduce payrolls. Foreign countries' machines are furthering automation, so we won't need as many people. But the union is against layoffs. I'm between a rock and a hard place. A word from the president! First, I offer my congratulations. Your elite scores in the entrance exam... have earned you a much-coveted spot at Camel Beer Co., Ltd. Since its founding in 1877, Camel has led the drink industry with the production of... high-quality Camel Beer, Cider, and Juice that are mindful of time-honored tradition. We have further maintained customer loyalty through... ultra-modern equipment and technology using the latest research, which we have paired with honest marketing. And there's a reason that we have hired you. The most important thing for you now... is to gain the competence to contribute to the company. So, I ask you to apply your gumption and... superior intellect to furthering Camel Beer's record of success. Here ends the message from the president. Next, we will start training. As noted in the pamphlets you've been provided, today's itinerary starts with... the director of the general affairs, that's me, explaining your... terms of employment, company employment policies, hiring procedures, and other matters, then we'll move on to company history, the history of Japan's beer industry, and other matters related to general affairs. In the afternoon, the factory chief will explain beer line production after the factory tour. Tomorrow, we will discuss beer feedstocks... Everyone, take notes! The second stage of brewing is the mashing process. Dried barley is hulled, milled, and vatted for mashing, which, once finished, the fermented mash is lautered to become wort, as you can see on the chart. Then, it is moved to a kettle where the hops are finally added. Trends in Beer Production Volume I will discuss the marketing channels and networks under the control of the marketing division... and relevant matters, as well as the changes and current state of sales volume. In the previous fiscal year, beer production was 171,881,280 liters, up from 168,484,140 liters... in the previous fiscal year, which represents nearly a 3% increase, and indexing 1912 as 100 reveals an increase of 26-fold, and the 1953 production level of 146,201,940 liters... Your days off are Sunday, national holidays, May Day, December 31, and January 2 and 3. The number of days of paid vacation for employees retained for less than one year... is one day for each month worked. For employees retained between one and six years, there are 12 days, and for seven years and beyond, the number of days is 13, with an additional day for every year worked, and additional months less than one year are rounded up... and additional years are omitted. Next, special paid vacation. One, seven days will be awarded in the case of death of a parent, spouse, or child; two, three days in the case of death of a grandparent, sibling, the parent of a spouse, or the spouse of a child. Why do we have to take notes about such mundane things? This is worse than school. Four of you will be working at the head office, one at the Amagasaki factory, three at the Moji factory, two at the Sapporo factory. Six of you will be issued third-class train tickets to your places of work. This concludes your fourth and final day of training. Tonight, you will be provided beer, so please enjoy yourselves at the dormitory. I think you and me are the only new hires without connections. The others just sucked up to the brass. I'm shipping out to Sapporo tomorrow. It's lonely drinking alone. You drink, why don't you have a glass? Nope, I've had a toothache ever since I drank at my graduation. Graduation. Work. Small raises. Retirement. - That's all there is. - What is? - A salaryman's life. - What are you talking about? What else do you think there is? Nothing. We both know it. The people who get hired through connections have pretty much the same fate as us. People who make it to upper management are success stories, but most of us crest at middle management. Your pension is a pittance, so the reality of modern Japan is that you starve once you turn 55. Age / Basic salary / Bonus I'm currently 23. Assuming I'm able to work 32 years till I turn 55, and assuming an annual pay raise and a twice annual bonus, I will earn a total basic income of 27,571,168 yen over 32 years... and a pension of 1,880,00 yen, which totals 29,451,168 yen. Wow, is that right? I'm impressed. Taxes, various types of insurance, and living expenses for me and my future family are deducted. Even assuming that I can manage to save half, that's 900,000 yen over 32 years. With my after-tax pension that's 1,900,000 yen, in the best case. A measly 1.9 mil. At most. You work your whole life for 1.9 million... that's depressing. The life of a salaryman is unappealing. Get used to it. Moroi Clocks & Watches That was the express to Osaka. Tamio was on it. I wish I could've seen him off. Pipe down, you've said that after every train that passed since this morning. All we have is a postcard from Tamio... saying that he was scheduled to go to his jobsite on the 26th. Today is the 26th. It was just a schedule. It can change. I guess he didn't have even a day to come home. I taught Tamio to be independent ever since he was a baby. Tamio got into the top school in Tokyo... and has now landed a job at a major company under his own steam. He's turned out to be a much better man than you expected. We should celebrate that. I just wanted to give him some red beans and rice... on the platform through the train window in celebration. Utter foolishness! Did you want to stand at the station all day waiting for him to come? The next train from Tokyo goes to Hakata and stops in Odawara at 3:20. He might be on this one. I imagine he will be. Thank you for waiting. I took this watch apart and cleaned it last month. It's difficult to conceive of it not keeping the correct time. Watches I repair keep the correct time. I've kept a store in Odawara for 30 years, and my skill at watch repair... is the only thing I'm proud of. Who says this timepiece is off? I set it by the clock in city hall. That clock is no good. I'm on the city council, so I spend all day there and I plan to go at 3:30 today. I've never seen the clock run on time. It's a disgrace. It's critical that things be precise and ordered. Not just for government offices, but for the nation as a whole. I also tried setting it to the hourly chime on the radio. The radio is useful. But overdependence on modern conveniences is the weakness of Japan. Civilization and culture are splendid things, but it's also important to have confidence in yourself. To trust in your own wristwatch. An independent spirit. Self-reliance. Coming Soon to a Theater Near You... CROWDED TRAIN Order forms Shipment forms Hey, is something wrong? Me? No, I'm fine. Then why aren't you working? - I'm finished. - That's no good. The morning siren blew just 10 minutes ago. Your daily work volume is fixed, and it's important that you continue to work through 5:00. If you unilaterally increase efficiency, operations won't proceed smoothly. Be careful. 200 orders 8-hour workday 25 per hour One order every two minutes and four seconds One has to take two minutes and four seconds. Toilet Is something wrong? - What do you need? - Are you sick? What? I can't hear you! You have a toothache? I can't hear you, bonehead! What do you need? - I asked if you had a toothache. - No. - Do you have pain anywhere else? - My tooth hurt. - That's what I just asked. - It doesn't hurt anymore. I had a friend who went crazy because of a toothache. There's a dentist in the factory; I'll inform him just in case. Dentist's Office - Does this hurt? - Uh-uh. And neither does this? And neither does this? So, nothing's wrong with you. Are you really in pain? What seems to be the trouble? He noticed he had a cavity when he drank beer at his graduation... and received treatment for it in Tokyo. Look, there's the filling and the rest of his teeth are fine. Still, he insists his teeth hurt when he comes to the factory. That's not true. It hurts when the machines are operating, and the pain goes away when they stop. It's not the machines, it's the sound. - The sound? - You see it sometimes. The noise on the floor is overpowering... isn't it? That's what's getting to you. It's not always a tooth. But for whatever reason, in your case, it is. But current medical science can't do much about it. So, when I'm accustomed to the noise, the pain will go away? Absolutely not! The pain will never go away. "I was worried that you might be lonely since we broke up. "The salarymen around me just go through the motions joylessly, "but I'm enthusiastic about working in the real world." "I was worried that you might be lonely since we broke up. "The salarymen around me just go through the motions joylessly, "but I'm enthusiastic about working in the real world." "I was worried that you might be lonely since we broke up. "The salarymen around me just go through the motions joylessly, "but I'm enthusiastic about working in the real world." Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. Today is Sunday. I heard you talking to yourself in here. It's common when lonely people don't have anyone to talk to. I'm not lonely! Are you going out? I'm sorry to bother you. It's all right! Please come in. I have tons of stuff to do, but I don't mind skipping it. I have some sweets if you'd like to come over and try them. Yes! It's kind of homey in here. Bachelor's dorms are so dreary. I like to make them a bit more livable. Then, people sometimes stop by and have some sweets. I wanted to invite you earlier, but I held off. Held off? Why? I thought you were scary. Scary? Why? University graduates sometimes think too much... And the life of a salaryman is so mundane. I'm not like that. It's never a surprise when an idealist commits suicide. Suicide? Who? A university graduate. When? I suppose he couldn't take the day-in, day-out of work. He was extremely bright. He jumped off the roof... and he came down like a black shadow, just as I was looking out the window. He lived next door. - Next door? - #206. #206? That's my room! Don't fret, it's just a coincidence. It's all right. I'll be fine. The job market is tough. Hey, you're lucky... his death created an opening in the company. I'm the only one that came here, but there were 10 new hires. Then, I guess 10 people die every year. - I assume some actually retire. - Sure, some retire. Sorry to bother you, Saraya, but I'm out of soy sauce. Can I borrow a bit? Thank you. That guy's wife left him a few years ago, and he returned to live at the dormitory. He likes cooking in his room. The pleasures of a salaryman are few, so it's pitiable not to have your own home. I have a fianc?e in my hometown, but I'm not financially secure, so I can't marry her. You need money if you want a woman. You don't need money to have a woman. - I have three girlfriends. - Three? We're just exchanging letters now. Letters? That doesn't cost money. Saraya, could I borrow a weekly magazine? He's got heart disease, but he's used up all his paid vacation and has to push himself to come into work. Once you fall behind your co-workers, you can never catch up. He pins his dreams on quizzes in weekly magazines. For a salaryman, health is top priority. I believe the rule of thumb is, "Don't slack off, don't rest, don't work." I completely disagree with that sentiment. - You have to do what you can. - What are you going to do? Oh, you have company. There's nothing to do on a Sunday, so I usually just end up bored. You'll have to excuse me. - What's wrong? - You should stay. Odawara Moroi Clocks & Watches "My son, thank you for the letters you sent. "I am extremely happy to hear that you are... "enthusiastically living in a precise and ordered manner. "My son, please don't be alarmed by what you are about to read. "I have been watching your mother go insane recently. "She is a docile psychotic, so you needn't worry. "I do not intend to cause you any concern with this matter. "Please continue to work hard." Mom! My mother! A letter from my Dad! That's terrible. You should go home immediately. But your mother was still young. I'm sorry for your loss. She's not dead. You get a week's vacation for a death in the family. What's the policy for critical condition? He can go if he tells personnel the name of the illness. Do I have to write the precise name of the illness? The company is a stickler in such matters. I don't have to go home. She just caught cold. Dad always exaggerates these things. I'm sorry to have bothered you. Did I say the wrong thing? Request for Clinical Psychiatric Researcher 2,000 yen/month tax-free payment I'm Hataro Washi of the Baba Psychiatric Research Institute. I'm the ideal candidate for this position and I'd like a recommendation. It's a request from a graduate named Tamio Moroi. His mother is psychotic and he requested... that someone research the causes and treatment of her illness. Fine, I'll do it. For a poor student like me, 2,000 yen a month is a fortune. Other research students are all well to do and won't make a fuss about this. It's an interesting case. I'll be able to finish my dissertation faster than my colleagues. Hello, Baba Psychiatric Research Institute. Bungei Publishing? The doctor is out. Coffee! I hate to bring this up, Doctor, but you don't seem to go to Osaka anymore. No time. I have lectures to give, students to see, and I have my own research. I also have patients to see. The hospital in Osaka must be in trouble, since you're a consultant there. I'm not a consultant. I'm the honorary director of the Osaka Mental Hospital. Shall I go, in your place? You dolt! What could you do? I give you chores to do and a little money because... I know your circumstances and I want to help. - I'm not interested in your expertise. - I know. On second thoughts, go. I need you to pick up my salary. Will you pay for the train? Thank you! Sorry for the wait. You're Dr. Washi? I'm Moroi. Thank you for your letter. I didn't think you'd be able to come. You seem so busy I imagine it was difficult for you to see me. No, I'm not busy, but I don't have a lot of time. You're not busy, but you don't have a lot of time... I see. I have to go back to work without lunch today. I finish at 5:00. Can I see you again? I'm not on a schedule, so I can meet anytime. I see. I'll see you again. I'm sorry about this. I'd be happy to direct you to a hotel. I don't mind; I came to study. - Sleep tight. - Thank you. I scoured the bookstores and read a lot, but I couldn't make any sense of it. It's not for amateurs. There are lots of specialties in psychiatry, and I doubt you'd understand, even if I explained it. There are no drugs that are magic bullets. It's an evolving field, and I thought I'd consult to see if there's anything if I could do. I wish I could go home myself, but I just can't. Then I'll go in your stead. It's on the way anyhow, so I'll go for you. You'll go for me? Sure. Here's the train fare. I know it's not much. Thanks. It's more practical for me to go. Please tell me something about the patient. I only have my father's letter, so I don't know the particulars, but it seems she always smiles. She smiles? She's always been kind of a grouch, and now she smiles all the time, or at least has a wry grin. Also strange is that she compliments my father. My father is a very hard-headed man and, of course, a bit old fashioned... and has a feudal streak, but he's pure and I respect him. I envy you... I'm an orphan. - I have to get up early. - Go ahead. I'm sorry I only have one futon. The hearse doesn't show up until all hours. I don't have time for dinner. Having a private practice means irregular work and never getting a good night's sleep, so I took a lousy-paying job as a factory physician, where I can work regular hours. So, what am I doing here? Make room for the stretcher bearers! They're taking Saraya to the hospital that I was at. Have you ever heard of someone suddenly collapsing and coughing up blood? He failed the CPA exam, and he was up late every night studying. I don't believe it. Saraya told me, "don't slack off, don't rest, don't work," but he was secretly studying. The cult of success is an outdated notion. Nobody wants to give up. I've had my back up against a wall ever since I was a child, but I used the pent-up energy for the triple jump. The triple jump? The hop, step, jump... you know. I'll be jumping over everyone, while they stand around like fools. - What for? - Money and fame. You're kind of a dupe. My base monthly salary is 16,000 yen. My overtime pay averages 500 yen. I pay 300 yen for health insurance. 250 yen for my national pension. 150 yen for unemployment insurance. 1,100 yen for income tax. 500 yen rent at this dormitory. That leaves me with a salary of 14,200. Once I account for food, transport, clothing, and walking-around money, I'm lucky if I have 4,000 yen left over. That's reality. I forge ahead, never forgetting it. But I don't give up. Even though the world is rigged for despair. You have to make something of yourself. That's my theory, it's... I thought Tamio had come home for a visit, but it was just his friend. How stupid of me. It's a mixed-up world. The turmoil is a symptom of the fixation with results at the expense of reason. As you may know, the boulevard left of the station hasn't been paved, so it was quickly decided to pave it for municipal beautification. But since there are plans to lay water mains under the road this year, I proposed to delay the road project until... after the water mains had been installed, but they still decided to pave the road, since postponing it would leave... budget allocations unused and incur the risk of budget cuts next year. Everyone agreed that I was correct, but said it had to be done. I've served four terms, "a full 16 years", but there's still no order to anything. It's pitiful. What do you do, aside from running the store? I'm on the city council. I'm tapped for the position every time... The city council? For four terms? Then you're a VIP here. I'm not comfortable being called a VIP. I apologize. I meant a man of influence. I wouldn't say so, but anyone would vouch for me as a man of principle. I bumped into the post again and broke a teacup. This hallway is too dark. Do you see? What did Tamio tell you? Don't worry about it! I'll buy you another teacup! I'll fix the light too! No problem! Actually, that's why I'm here. I'm a researcher at the psychiatry department at Peace University. I came at Tamio's request, to see how your wife is doing. He's too busy to come himself. He's turned into a fine man. Thank you for coming. It's nothing. Tamio doesn't know it, but I've been watching him since he was a student. - He's a fine man and he stands out. - Thank you. Now that I've seen your wife's condition, you should really consult a specialist. But I'm not sure if such a specialist exists... not for her condition. Does the city hospital have a psychiatrist? No, it doesn't. People who are really sick usually go to Tokyo. That's no good. You're close to the ocean here and the air is clean. It's really the ideal place for weak-minded individuals. You may not know this, but there are a large number of people... with latent, or mild forms of mental illness. I don't think she's aware that anything is wrong with her. I see. Now that you mention it, everyone at the council meeting seemed a bit off. They should be pitied. I broke the teacup, and we don't have any more English breakfast tea. So I made green tea. People usually think mental hospitals are like dungeons, but there are also cheerful institutions... that many people casually visit when they feel strange or can't sleep, much the same way that you'd see a doctor for a sour stomach, and they do a lot of good. She should go, while her condition is still mild. The mind is the fountainhead of order. You truly are a man of influence, so couldn't you set up a mental hospital for the community? I appreciate your confidence. Educated men always have big ideas, and I respect your opinion. I will do everything I can to build such a hospital. I'll receive my Ph.D. next year, and I promise to help you then. Amagasaki Post Office Hataro Washi Psychiatry Department, Peace University Tokyo - How much is in the envelope? - 2000 yen. That'll be 50 yen. Amagasaki Men's Wear How can I help you? Can you take care of this? Patch another dress shirt? What gives? There's no place for another patch. You'll be wearing a rag. - I don't mind. - You don't understand. I have your suit. Do you want to see it? It's important to value your possessions, but you're getting a new suit, why not buy a new shirt to go with it? 500 yen will buy you a real nice one. A salaryman only needs a suit. What's underneath is irrelevant. Ten-month installment plan, right? Sorry, wrong room! - Iki?! - Hello, Moroi? Long time, no see. Are you well? I can't believe you came! Are you on vacation? Are you going to stay a while? Is this your first time in Kansai? I can show you around if you want. I'm not in any hurry. You can show me around on your day off. I don't care where we go; I just came to see you. There were cuts to the prefectural budget... and staff at the school were streamlined. I was let go. Once you've lost your job, it's hard to find a new one... particularly for a woman. So, I thought I would let you use that part. - What part? - The part that I'm a woman. Are you asking me to marry you? I wouldn't have put it in such brash terms. I don't want to think about a career, marriage, or love as separate things. Everyone has to live. I agree. I feel the same way. Why the long face? Did something happen at work? Nope. It should be obvious. This is a bachelor's dormitory. I have to move if I get married. There must be dormitories for families. - They're all full. - We could rent a cheap apartment. I don't have the money. So, you don't want to marry me? No, I don't mind... but I have other monthly expenses. I understand. What are you doing? I'm leaving. Stay a while. Women can't stay over at the bachelor's dormitory, but I can get the Super to take care of it for two or three days. I don't want to be a burden. It would be a mistake. This whole thing has been a mistake, and I just want to cut it short as soon as possible. I plan to marry eventually, and I don't mind marrying you. But you can't now, right? - Not now. - Then I'm leaving. Goodbye, take care. I'll see you off. This place is crowded. They're just out for a walk. - Nobody's buying anything. - Indeed. Totapon For nerve pain and stiff shoulders Doctor's Office, GP You sure did put on a lot of these things. It's really swollen. Doesn't it hurt? The dormitory stairs are steep. How's the tooth? - Not so bad recently. - Just as I suspected. This looks like nerve pain, but it's not. It's the sound... the sound of the machines. The pain went all the way from your mouth to your knee. - From my tooth to my knee? - Yep. Take some time off of work. The factory will run fine without you, and so long as the machines are running, the company will be all right. You're pretty ignorant for a factory doctor. We're like a part of the machine, and so long as the machines are running, we can't rest. That's too bad. We have a drug that works pretty well for neuralgia. - Give it to me. - I've no idea if it will work for you. Let's give it a try. Only one left. Everybody's using it! OK, on your belly. Lower your trousers. Show me your butt. Why did you wake me up in the middle of the night? I didn't call a doctor. You didn't, but others did. You were moaning loudly. It feels better if I moan. The pain isn't as bad. You definitely have a fever. I have chills... and my butt hurts. Let's have a look. Wow, that's swollen. Right where I made the injection. It happens sometimes. The medicine worked a little too well. - How's your knee? - My knee? Move it back and forth. - It doesn't hurt. - Hey, it's better. That drug really works! Still, your butt's all swollen. This should be researched. Hurry... stop... the pain! Stick your butt out. I'll give you a shot. Another shot? It will prevent infection. Mom, what are you doing here? You're... you're... You've had a difficult time too. Your hair has turned completely white. Really? I think that your mind is playing tricks on you. That's right, it's white. Be calm. I'm calm, and I'll be all right no matter what happens. There's something I have to tell you. Your father is crazy. I know, I know... Crazy people think they're sane and that it's other people who are crazy. That's right. Dad says that I'm crazy. I've had a terrible time with him. It first happened when your older brother... died at age six from childhood dysentery. The second time was when our first son died in the war. You're our third child and the only one who's still alive. But you're so important now that I can't hardly ever see you. I don't know why I complain. Pickled plums Sometimes I think better of it. Fish paste That's why I decided to laugh whenever things seem difficult. At first, it was difficult. But now I've gotten good at it. And when I put your dad in a mental institution, I did it with a smile. Dad's in a mental institution?! It feels better. I'm better! It doesn't hurt. No pain anywhere. Tamio, calm down. Your mother is here. It's white! My head is completely white! You're still young. Your hair will be all right. Mom, who's the crazy one? Is it Dad? Is it you? Is it me? Let's go home! I have to see for myself! Everyone here but me is crazy, but they're all fine people. When I give the speeches that I give at city hall, everyone here fully agrees with me. The road repair issue, the free lodging issue... Did you see your mom? Did she seem strange? She's completely out of it. Now that I'm in here, I don't have to deal with the boobs on the outside. I tell her she should stay here too, but she doesn't understand. How do feel? All right? His pulse is extremely rapid. His condition is deteriorating. I can't find his charts, Doctor. Do you know your name? Do you remember what it is? I'm a visitor. What is this? I'm a busy man, and I've said before that we need a system so I can easily identify patients. You're a bunch of cretins. Next! There's something I want to tell you. I know you're busy at work, but I want you to check in here as soon as you can. But when you do, you can't push people around, just because you're my son. I won't show you any favoritism. I detest improprieties. There is order here. Everything is precise. It's probably because the food is the same every day. I've been busy. I'm sorry you had to wait. I knew I wanted to see you when I heard you were visiting your father. What's going on here? All of the rooms are full. I apologize. We have a lot to talk about; let's get out of here. Absolutely. Blueprint of the Odawara Mental Hospital Construction is to start right away, so it should be completed by year end. We plan to transfer your dad here as soon as it's completed. After all, he worked so hard to get the thing built, so we'll make him our first patient. Given his standing, we will of course waive any medical fees. For Ozawa Who the hell are you? I thought you were a researcher at Peace University. Thanks to you, my doctoral dissertation was approved this spring. So, mum's the word about this at the university. So many people would like to trip me up. I have to keep it a secret until the hospital's completed and I'm working here. I hope you won't tell anyone. I asked you to determine the cause of my mother's illness. I did. I came to realize that it was actually your father who was mentally ill. My dad's not crazy. He says funny things sometimes, but usually he's right. He's completely paranoid. Think about it rationally. Why would a sane man want to be committed to a mental institution? Your dad was happy to be committed, and he doesn't want to leave. That's because the world is a mess and he can see through it. Try this. What are you doing? I wondered if there wasn't something wrong with you too. Don't talk nonsense! People who ruminate about serious things tend to be a little funny these days. I'm not like my dad; I know the world is mixed up. - I accept that. - Then you're probably all right. Your dad developed astigmatism recently. Think about the shock for a man who for 30 years lived by his skill as a craftsman, then suddenly loses that skill. That's the primary cause. Do you have any idea how expensive 2,000 yen a month is for a working stiff? I do, and I used that money wisely. I got my Ph.D. and I built a hospital. You indirectly contributed to the betterment of society. You took my money and used my father's influence to build a hospital in Odawara! I see no wrong in taking advantage of an opportunity. I told you that life was like a triple jump. I'm just doing what I said. I was a shoo in for hospital director from the outset. But I built it with your father, and I couldn't accept the position. Still, I'm sure I'll be the director soon enough. You just watch me... the triple jump. See. Hop, step, jump! Washi! Washi! Ouch! Are you up? Where am I? - Peace University Hospital. - Hospital? My hair's black! You just needed rest. - What happened to Washi? - He died. You ran into a telephone pole and have been unconscious for 31 days. We treated you with targeted temperature management. - 31 days?! - 32, as of today. I only took three days off of work. Why didn't you wake me?! You were on the verge of dying. If we hadn't treated you properly, you'd already be dead. I really feel for you. If there's anything I can do, I will. But the company has its rules. If you fail to report to work without notice and without good reason... for over a week, your wages are terminated and you're fired. Didn't you learn this during orientation? I know. I had no choice but to report it to the head office. It wasn't personal. I understand. You can collect your last month's salary... and your pension at the accounting department. - Is that so? - What? Is that so?! An address by the principal. This is a most auspicious graduation ceremony. The long-held dream... of having a large auditorium at Peace University... was made possible by students in the School of Architecture, along with substantial funding and the cooperation... of the faculty, and thus I have orchestrated... this graduation ceremony today. We can celebrate a new chapter... in your lives in a new building. I believe this is an appropriate celebration... that will not soon be repeated. When you think of this day... as a single moment in your lives, I hope that you will hold your heads high, with gratitude and hope for your future. 83% of our graduating class of Peace University... have been able to find employment. Still, it's better than last year. I'm sorry, we can't really help someone who graduated three years ago. Thank you. - Are you all right? - Are you all right? Who left the baseball here? - I'm all right. - It's dangerous. I played over lunch. - I'm all right! - It dropped on the floor. - You have to keep the floor clear. - It's not my fault. The heck it isn't. You, you're playing... catch in an office. Guys like you... Line up! Please line up in a single file line! Line up down the street. Don't block traffic! Hey, you're sticking out! Stay to the side! Moroi, I can't believe it. We have five clerks and this many people looking for work. - Can't you do anything about it? - Nope. They just hired me last year. It's painful to hear, but we simply don't need graduates from top universities. I'm just a high school graduate. Hey, stop fighting and get back in line! Unemployment Insurance Payment Inquiry Officer Iki! Moroi, what are you doing here? Long time, no see. How are you? When did you come to Tokyo? I thought you were in Amagasaki. It didn't work out. I had some problems and got fired. I looked everywhere for a new job, but no luck. It's frustrating. So I started coming here every day. I wonder why we haven't met until now. I've been coming every day too. You too? You've been unemployed all this time? Not exactly unemployed. It's complicated. Tell me. - #83 please proceed to counter #13. - #83... that's me! I'll be back! Iki, I got a job! I faced reality and gave it my all. Don't give up! That's great. What's the company? It's not a company, it's a school; I'll be a janitor at an elementary school. A janitor at an elementary school? I didn't write that I had graduated university. They can't place graduates. You graduated Peace University, and you have to hide it so you can work as a janitor. I don't mind. An elementary school janitor is a proper salaryman. My starting salary will be 7,000 yen, so if I work 20 years, I'll get 2.5 million yen. With a twice annual bonus, that's 3.2 million yen. And I'll get a pension. And with you by my side, nothing can stop me. It could work. Will you marry me? I'm already married. My husband's a janitor. A janitor?! What were you thinking? It wasn't a mistake. I didn't have a choice. I couldn't make ends meet. You should've waited. You ended up marrying a janitor anyhow. You both have the same profession, but you and I were meant to be. I know. I was meant to marry you. It was you I loved, Moroi. #206 please proceed to counter #19. #206... that's me! We both have to work to get by. I have to go. - Take care. - You too, Moroi. Thank you for your efforts. I'll be taking over as the new janitor. Thank you. I'm sorry for your misfortune. All I have is a teaching certificate, so it's unseemly that the janitor be a graduate of Peace University. Why did you lie about your education? You have to take care of your mother, so it's hard to ask you to go. But the new janitor is here, and it's unseemly for you to stay on. The principal is very sorry. There's no reason for concern. There's a small house behind the janitor's closet. There's a house there, and I moved in there this morning. Behind the janitor's closet. That filthy hovel? What about the cesspool there! I looked into it and the principal's first son... has been trying to get into university for three years. The vice principal's son graduates high school next year. Leave it to me. I'll make sure they get into university. My pedigree at Peace University is, as you have checked yourselves, a bona fide fact. I'll be opening my entrance exam school tomorrow. Please send your sons to me. Moroi Entrance Exam Preparatory School Leave it be, Mom. I'll take care of it. I'm glad I can be with you. Just like your dad always said, you're so dependable. I feel safe with you. I hope your dad gets better soon, so he can live here too. Mom, I only have two students, but more will come. Monthly tuition is 500 yen. 10 students will be 5,000 yen. 20 students will be 10,000 yen. A hundred will be 50,000 yen. We'll build this school up. In the future, we'll add a second story to the house. Are you OK? It's all right! I'm just fine! It's OK! The wind tends to gust here! It's no big deal! We will commence the entrance ceremony! An address by the principal. Elementary School Entrance Ceremony I would like to begin by offering my congratulations. Today, you have become first grade elementary school students. I hope you will study hard with your teachers to become fine people. Studying is a good thing. There is always another school ahead of you. Next comes junior high, then high school, and then university. Your futures are truly bright. The End
