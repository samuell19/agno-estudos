RODAN - GIANT MONSTER FROM THE SKY (SORA NO DAIKAIJU RADON) KYUSHU - MOUNT ASO Hey! Good Morning. - Hey, were you out last night again? - Yes, I'm sorry. That's not good! Get back! Back off! What is this? Stop getting so excited! Stop! Stop! How many times have I told you to stop this foolishness? I won't put up with this anymore! Alright, Yoshi? You too, Goro. Well everyone, let's go, let's go! Save your strength for the mines! - Good morning. - Good morning. Descending! Hello! Good morning. It's very warm out today. Haven't you figured out what's wrong with the Earth? What's happening to the Earth? With eight million tons being mined out of this entire area, I'd say the Earth is running out of ore. Oh, no! Hello, main office. Filled with water?! Mine number eight? Alright, I'll be there soon. Two meters of water has flooded the mine. That's strange. There wasn't any there the last time it was surveyed. It must be an underground spring. I'll go check it out. - Hey, give me a hand here! - Yes, sir! It's shut down! It's shut down! - Go ahead! - Go ahead! Thank you for coming! How did it happen? We were mining a wall, when it started flooding. How bad is it? It's flooded pretty bad... We had no way to control it. Well I'm glad that everyone's safe. No... Yoshi and Goro are still down there. I need to down and look at it. I need some volunteers. - Is it okay? - It's okay. Suikishi, Saba... Let's go! - Be careful. - Be careful. That's Yoshi! Hurry! Hurry! - Yoshi! - Yoshi! Hurry! Hurry! Doctor... It's hard to say. It's not a simple wound. I've never seen a head wound like that. But... What could have done something like that? You've contacted the police, right? Yes. They should be here around 1 PM. Yoshi's my husband! Let me see him! Please let me see him! Please let me see him! Please let me see him! Please let me see him! Wait! Wait! You'll have to wait for the doctors see him. Let's go. Haven't they found Goro yet? Hey! There's no proof he's the criminal, right? I'm prepared to believe it. That's my opinion of it. That's for the police to decide. It's best to keep it to yourself. But, he and Goro were working together. Why haven't they found Goro's body? Please don't go spreading this around. Oh, they're taking a look at him now. Kio... ls it true about my brother?... It's impossible. But, everyone... Believe in your brother. Until they can get a hold of Goro, they can't be sure if he's the criminal. I'm sure of it. I can walk with you to the mines. Come on, let's go. - Oto! - Here! - Oetsuka! - Here! - Ooyama! - Here! - Mamura! - Here! - Hodo! - Here! - Akeshita! - Here! - Mamona! - Here! - Akira! - Here! - Here! - Here! We've completed a full roll call and Goro is the only one missing. You're sure that Goro hasn't come out yet? This is the only way out of the mine. You hear that? You're too jumpy! Someone must have gone in again. No! The only person in there would be... Goro. Alright. I'm going in. Give me the rope. There must be something wrong with him. What's that noise? Goro? Goro! It's him! Idiot! Control yourself! It may be nothing... - Goro? - Goro! It's him! Idiot! There's nothing to be afraid of! Keep quiet! - Hey, just a moment. Here they come! - Hold on please. These aren't ordinary murders. How could a criminal make wounds like this on these men? The wounds could only have been made by someone of great strength. In Japan and in the rest of the world, I've never seen a weapon so sharp. What is the weapon? I regret that I can't even guess. Incredible... Murders unlike any in Japan. Of course, we'll have to do something. I'll increase the number of police in the village. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Hurry! Get the others! Otama! Otama! Otama! Otama! Kio! Kio! Let me go! Let me go! Stop! She's right. You cannot blame her for your pain, ok?! Thank you... Shigeru! Kio... I don't believe Goro is the murderer. To kill... Goro would have to be pushed too far. I don't think he killed anyone. I'm sure of it. I believe Goro knows who did it. So, don't count him out yet. Okay? Kio! Hey! Police! It's an emergency! Oh! Let's go! There! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry, please! Run across the bridge! What's going on? Come on! There it is! Alright, let's go! Fire! - It's in sight! - We're firing! Look out! Damn... Oh, no... Alright, let's go! Captain, I believe that thing is our murderer. That thing?! Put me through. Ah, headquarters? This is Nishima. What's the matter with you?! When you assigned me here I thought I was going after a criminal! What are you saying?! I need men with pistols and machine guns right away! Hurry, please! Don't delay! The monster has retreated into one of the older shafts! Right! - Okane! Okane! - Hurry! Hurry! - Hang in there! - Help is coming! Hey, is he okay? Stretcher! Okane! Head inside! Right. To the hospital! Boss... If that thing's in there, let me go after it. Idiot! Going in there is dangerous! Besides, the military is on its way here. Let's go! Halt! Thank you for coming. - Remove the barrier. - Yes, sir. First unit, set up! The rest keep moving! It's filled with water! Alright, let's go. Goro! Goro! Fire! - Right. I have an idea! - Okay! Let's go! Look out! It will come this way! Here I go! - Let's get the debris up front. - Roger! Hey! Just a moment! Shoot! Fire, please! Are you okay? Are you okay? I can't believe what we saw. A creature like this is quite amazing. For the Meganuron to have the strength to do that to a man... You could earn a living finding proof of their existence. You would expect it to come from outer space. Oh, I'm with the Seibu Newspaper. It was inside the coal mine, so we can assume the Meganuron hatched from an egg there. Things that could affect its age range from temperature and to where it was buried. It may have been around for 3 or 4 years. Although it's difficult to see how old it is, I have enough data to produce a theory. We understand. This time, the larva changed tactics for a short period and that created the outbreak of murders. But Why did it do that?... How's the excavation going? It was a large cave-in. I regret that we haven't found him yet. An earthquake! Hello? Yes, this is Chief Scientist Sugahara. Hello. The earthquake we just felt... Where was its epicenter? We're just finishing... We believe that it's near the area of Kotowataji. Is the science center certain of that? It's not exact. We think it was near coal mines, but it wasn't strong enough to damage them. I understand. Keep up the good work. - Get the cars. - Yes, sir. Hey, stop! Stop! That's strange... I don't see how this much damage could have been made from a shock like that. Look at that guy over there! Hey! Hey! What happened? Is this Shigeru? The last I heard he was stuck in a cave-in. Kamura! Kamura! Hang in there! Kamura! What happened to him? Kamura! Kamura! Can you say something for the Seibu Newspaper? Kamura! Kamura! - Thank you... - Let's get him inside. Kamura! Kamura! Clear the way! Clear the way! Kamura! It's me! Don't you know that it's me? Take a look at me! It's me! You know what my name is! Shigeru! Shigeru! Shigeru! What's... What's wrong with him? As far as I can tell, he doesn't recognize any of you. I'm not sure how long this amnesia will last. We'll treat him at the hospital. We'll take him right away. Let's go... Alright, take it easy. Close your eyes. Okay, open your eyes. Once more, close your eyes and take a deep breath. And this is? You were the first one to see this. Look at it very carefully. Can you remember it? Shigeru! Yes? Yes, they're going to pass over the volcano tomorrow morning. Yes, this is Nishima. It could erupt tomorrow? It might be wise for them to stay at their post? I understand. I'll tell them it's urgent. Right, I understand. I'll do what I can in the morning. I can't believe they're doing it, just so they can find this monster. I would just blow it off the mainland! This is Kitahara. Unknown object at 50.5 degrees, 20,000 feet, traveling at supersonic speed! What? Did I hear him correctly? Kitahara, Kitahara. This is base. Recommend you check it out. Recommend that you check it out. Roger, roger. Base, base. This is Kitahara. This is Kitahara. Object in the sky still traveling at supersonic speed. lt just completed a 1 1/2 times vertical loop. What?! One and a half? The object is still traveling at a high speed. Kitahara! Kitahara! Pursue it! Escape if it comes after you! Roger, roger! It's coming back towards me! It's moving too fast to avoid it! Damn! Kitahara! Kitahara! It's impossible! But the radar showed what happened in the air. Is that what you think? How can something that size maneuver so quickly in the air? Of course, I don't know... but perhaps if it had registered at other installations... What do you think it was? It didn't look anything like a flying saucer. Yes? Huh? Yes... Just a moment. Excuse me. It's your office. Oh, thank you. Hello. This is lizeki. It's been sighted at other locations? What? They're talking about flying saucers? I'll be there. I just got word from my office. They're keeping track of the object. Can't they tell us where it's going? PEKING PHILIPPINES TOKYO ls the Earth a target? Many people believe that this flying object is actually a flying saucer. Also, this flying object has reached speeds that would be impossible for us to achieve. It was sighted in Peking at 11:00 AM, then sighted in Manila at 11:20 AM, both Japan time. Drive carefully on that mountain. You never know what could happen. We've already had our earthquake. What else could possibly happen? I can't see how they could both be dead. There was no one else in the area. If this was going to be a double suicide, wouldn't their camera and shoe be close by them? - Really? - Also, they wouldn't be apart. This mess doesn't add up to anything, huh? These men would like to speak with you later, regarding three missing cows. We want to tell you about it. - The film is developed. - Oh, it's done! - Hey, take care of those two. - Yes, sir. Lizeki, this is the film from the camera. Of course... This looks like two typical newlyweds... What is that? Doctor, could that be a flying saucer? It looks a lot like... an animal. - Is that it? - There's no mistake. It's a Pteranodon. Haiyama... If it is, it's traveling very fast. But wasn't this photograph taken recently? The Pteranodon roamed the earth about two million years ago. How could it be captured on film? But is this a Pteranodon? Do you mean one of them lives in the mountain and no one knows about it? After all that, you expect me to believe such a thing? Yes. The characteristics are the same as in this photo. If one still exists, what can we do to catch it? Go ahead... Shigeru, look at them. They're so cute. Do you know what they are? Shigeru! Shigeru! - Kio! - ShiQQFUI Kio... I... What did I... Shigeru... you're out of danger! You are... That's it... There's no doubt about it. Thank you! This was the thing that was eating the creatures inside of the mountain? Yes. I saw it with my own eyes... This thing was eating them. Alright, I know what we have to do. Come with me. Incredible... This is it. I'm certain this is where the egg was. If it is Kamura, why aren't there any remnants of the egg? The cave-in may have covered it up. It could have... Doctor, this is it! This is part of the egg! - This is part of the egg? - It is. Hey, it's a cave-in! Hey! Get out! Hurry! The tests are completed. The results are very good. - Percent data? - Ninety percent. Really? Judging from the cell structure, I'd say this creature was reptilian. See for yourself. Of course... The egg matches perfectly. The problem is guessing the size of the egg based on the inner curve of this section. I can't believe the size of this egg. You might hear about an egg like this in the book, "Arabian Nights"... You'd think an egg like that came from space. But for nature to produce an egg like that... This egg is a product of both nature and man. I don't think this will determine its final size. - But, you... - No, thank you. This confirms my theory. To repeat, this Pteranodon is a life form that is alive due to unusual circumstances. We have determined that this creature is part of the species called Rodan. Its wingspan will reach 270 meters and it will weigh one hundred tons when fully grown. The Rodan's strength was discovered to be similar, but more powerful that its cousin's. It's a sonic boom. Since it flies at supersonic speeds, it's natural that its wings create the phenomenon. - Professor, I have a question. - Go ahead. If a Rodan is among us now, has the Professor thought about how it survived? I have a theory regarding that question. From what I've concluded, radiation and atomic bombs may have been the spark that gave it life. It may have seeped into the caverns from the outside and this new energy revived Rodan from its stasis. That's what I think. - But... could that be all? - No, there may be other factors... But I haven't fully explored them yet... Professor, the real problem is where do we begin our search for Rodan. ls there one spot? There's no doubt... Near these coal mines and in this general area would be the likely spot. It would go beyond these two areas if there were a drought or shortage of food. This should be enough of an area to begin. What's that? That's it! That's definitely it! That's the thing I saw! Alright! Head back and inform headquarters! What?! Rodan is coming? Right, I understand! Damn! Jets two and three are left! Base, base. This is limura. Rodan is still in the air. Alright... Continue pursuing the monster! Continue pursuing the monster! Roger, roger! Over there! Everyone, please make your way to the buses! Hurry! Go to the buses! Let's go! We did it! Rodan is changing course. We have scored at least one hit. Its speed is down to half. Here it comes! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Quickly! Order our forces to attack it while it's on the ground! Mobile armored units, move into position while it's attacking the city. Open fire on Rodan as soon as you are able. There's another! There isn't just one! We have sighted a second Rodan! Over there! I see the second one! It's coming from the ocean! Have all available units begin attacking the one in the air! Yes, sir! I'll order an air assault right away! - How's the battle going? - Take a look! One of them did this. Incredible! And Rodan?... - He got away. - Got away?! It's not from this area. I think it went back to where it had hatched. It's unusual, but our intelligence doesn't know where either of the Rodan's could be. Do you think the two have left the area? No. I'm certain that both Rodan's are in the Mount Aso region. Mount Aso region? The truth is, these animals are assisting each other. They'll stay in a place that's easily defended. If we were to use the camera film as testimony, I'd say that they were staying in that area now. We are in the area now. Please take us down. - There it is! - Ah! We've found one! - Professor, you were right! - Yes. It's a splendid bird. Unit number one will concentrate their attack in this vicinity. At the same time, unit number two will attack this area. The explosions should bury both Rodan's. Just a moment please. Could that cause Mount Aso to erupt? We don't believe that the attack will cause an eruption. It's not so absurd! How could you ignore the possibility of it happening? - But... - No I'm opposed to the idea! Sugahara, of course there is always some kind of risk in an operation like this. That's not what I'm talking about. The people... Their livelihoods... Listen, what would happen to the Kyushu area if we allowed the Rodan's to live? Unless you have a better idea, we cannot be bothered by such complaints! Headquarters, this is command outpost. We have three platoons ready to attack. Over... Yes, this is Nishima. Yes. All of our units are ready for the attack. We will inform you when our advance has stopped. Right. Roger. Have unit one set their position and prepare to attack. Right. I'll contact unit one and tell them to stand ready. Unit number one, unit number one, prepare to attack. Kio! - Shigeru! - You're not supposed to be here! - I know. - Then why are you here?! I don't know why I came. I'm sorry. Thank you. It's dangerous out here, so let's hurry inside. - Unit one is ready to attack! - Open fire! - Yes, sir! Open Fire! - Right! Open fire! - Open fire! - Fire! It's an emergency! The attack is affecting the mountain. It may erupt at any time! What do we do? Alright... We'll continue our attack. Unit number two is ready to attack! - Alright... Open fire! - Open fire! It's Rodan! - Give the order to cease fire. - Give the order to cease fire. All units are ordered to cease fire.
