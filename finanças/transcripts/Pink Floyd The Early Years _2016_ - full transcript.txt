[French commentator] Friday 25th of February, in HÃ©rouville, 50 kilometres from Paris, Pink Floyd records the music for a new film by Barbet Schroeder, the director of More -You might have to direct -Yeah -Well, it's on -It's on? -Yeah -Okay Well, let's talk about first... [Interviewer] David Gilmour, Roger Waters -The second one -Yeah [Roger] Yeah [Interviewer] Are you going to make an album, like More? Have you started? [David] The film is finished, but the album isn't We're doing it [Interviewer] Why did you come to France to do it? [David] It's easier to do a soundtrack in France and the taxes are lower [Interviewer] I read an old Roger Waters interview in Melody Maker In that interview, Roger sounded rather sad about Pink Floyd, a bit disappointed by the fact that it was always the same, the same music, the same reaction by the audience Is it still the same? [Roger] No Now we're doing something completely different New tracks, a lot longer And we're trying to... ...do something that's a lot closer to theatre [Interviewer] I was surprised when we were waiting on the stairs to get into the studio because there was a track that was quite rock and that surprised me from Pink Floyd, who don't have a rock 'n' roll image [David] This isn't true because in More, there are two or three tracks, that are very heavy rock 'n' roll [Interviewer] Do you think that now, you're more politically radicalised by the fact that having been in the system for so long, you started realising certain things...

[David] We plan to do everything We'll keep on touring in the States And other countries [Roger] Unless we finally have our breakdown of course [David] What we'd like is... to rest because the only thing that could keep us from touring IS nervous tension We never really had a few days off We had a couple of days, but never a few days or at least I never realised it [Roger] You reach a point where hundreds of people offer you to do different things And I think we accept to take on too many things [David] So do | -That's fine -Is that it? Yeah After all... [Interviewer] Are you rehearsing or recording straightaway? No, we're recording straightway [David] Are we rehearsing? No, we're recording We're making a gramophone record and a film soundtrack [Roger] Create a...
