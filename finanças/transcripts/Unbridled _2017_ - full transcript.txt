The wolf is starving and its pupils widen at the sight. At my bare flesh around my bones. Sarah. You look nice today. Ah. You're up early, that's good. Are you all ready? Karen won't let me go. No. Go. Kenny hi. She's not going to school today. She told me to tell you she'll see you next week. Thanks for the paper. Roger, honey, do you want some eggs? What do you think? Karen. You know how important the next few weeks are to my business. Are to me. Hmm, hmm. And you know how much I love you. I need to take her. The boss is really into ginger, you know, the red heads. She'd be featured in the spread. I'll protect her. Baby do me this favor and then we'll go to Kauai, just you and me, I promise. Do me a favor. Call her in sick today and I'll have her back for Monday. It's easy, so easy. Yeah she's African, absolutely spectacular. Perfect skin. She'll be great for the campaign. I'll bring her. Soon. And there's double, she's worth it trust me. Yeah I got a ginger. Hmm. Sangrin. Mitchell, it's Denton. The girls were on their way to South America, but we know they're tested her locally to make sure they uh, perform well. Just before your daughter Alison was found she had made from that same pay phone and then it went dead. Obviously these perverts don't allow the girls to have a cell or anything like that and I'm sure you're gonna find the prints on the phone... No, no prints. The phone was clean. Nothing? No prints at all? - Nope, nope. - Not even on the receiver? There was no receiver. - What? - They broke it off. Look, we've got nothing. Hi honey. What happened to your hand? Oh, I shut my hand in a door, it's nothing. How was the weekend? I don't wanna talk about the trip. Why don't you pour us a drink? Whoa. Hi Sarah. So what's up? I waited for you last week but you never came out. Well I'll be off of work study today, so you'll be glad to know I'll be in class. Alright, well if that's not enough here, I have you something. Fresh from mom's oven. Hey. How do I know this is safe to eat? Ooh, well I guess you don't. But you already ate some, so I guess you're a goner. Get out. There's extra credit for real research, not just Wikipedia. And we're gonna continue our American Literature series with Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, one of my personal favorites. Glad you could make it today Sarah. Super hoodie girl finally made it. Yeah, does she even own anything else? Probably not. Guys, that's enough. Thank you. If you could take your homework out and swap with your neighbor for peer review. Sarah. So, what did we learn from reading The Scarlet Letter? Anyone? Okay. Eeny, meeny, miny, Laura. What is the theme of the book? It's about a single, pregnant outcast lady who's outcast because she gets pregnant and she's not married. Okay, thank you Laura. Can anyone expand on that? Kenny, your partner is? Sarah. Can you tell us about her assessment? Um. Well it's about inequality. Can you please explain what Sarah means? Well this girl gets pregnant by a well respected man and she's branded for it, but he's not. So I guess guys can just do whatever they want. Great point Sarah, can you expand on that argument? Sarah. I don't know. Come on Sarah, does branding the girl only sound fair to you? I don't know. I mean, maybe she had to do it. Some things just happen. Maybe she just watched it and went along with it. Maybe she deserved it. Hey remember your final report on this is due next time, I mean it. Hey Kenny, can I talk to you for a minute? If you could sit down. Please. Yeah Miss B. So Kenny, something isn't right with Sarah. I don't really know her that well so. Kenny, we're both two intelligent people here. Tell me what you know. When we were going to school, she didn't see me but I saw her throw some lingerie and some heels... Kenny, in my work with the county we are seeing more and more of this kind of abuse in the suburbs, have you seen any kind of strange behavior in your neighborhood? No ma'am, I haven't. But I need to go now. Just sit tight a while longer okay. Hey kid. Kenny right? Listen you did a good thing. No really. We found the clothes in the sewer just like you said. And with her statement against the boyfriend, Roger, we can take action. And I promise you, we will get him. Hey, call me okay. Kenny. I know this feels awkward, but you did the right thing letting me know about the clothes. Where will she go now? The Safe Haven Honor Home. What about her therapy? County will be in to supervise it. That's pretty bleak. How do you know? From work study. I thought it was a horse farm, Unbridled right? Yeah, but Miss B, the Academy is a program for girls who have had it rough. They use horses for therapy. I mean, it's a day program, she couldn't stay there, but the therapy is amazing. I see, does it work? Really well, I mean it's really hard to get into, but we should try. For Sarah. Hmm. Hi dad, okay I know you said I couldn't stay at Martha's house but her mom's gonna be back in the morning and it's gonna be really, really. Stop. It's gonna be really soon, don't worry. Okay, I love you, I will see you tomorrow. Bye. Just like we practiced babe. Am I gonna get in trouble? Just do it. Just a minute. Hi, can I help you? Yeah, are you Roger Donegal? Yes I am, what can I do for you? You can come with me, I've got a warrant for your arrest. You're being charged with engaging in the prostitution of a minor. What? And contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Okay, you need to come with me right now? I need to read that warrant. You need to come with me alright. Let's go. Detective. Calm down, calm down, I barely touched you. - Get back ma'am, get back. - Obviously you don't your... - Let's go. - Oh man that hurts. - I'm barely touching you. - Ow, ow. Really, really? You've got a right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Ma'am, you need to back up. Let's go. Step inside, so watch your head. Ow, ow. Ma'am you need to back up. Call the police, call the police. - I am the police. - Call the police! Hello Sarah, welcome to Safe Haven. - Miss Bowdren. - Gerald. Thank you. We will get back to you as soon as Sarah has a chance to get checked in. You're gonna like it here Sarah, I promise. And you should be clear for school in a couple of days. We'll take it from here. I'd like to just make sure she gets settled in okay. I'm sorry, it's a co-ed group home and we have very strict rules Mrs. Bowdren. Come on Sarah. Right, well, why don't you come in and visit for a little while? But you need to be out by 11 sharp. - Alright. - Sarah, Mrs. Bowdren. I'll only be a few minutes. Let's go kiddo. What's gonna happen to him? Roger's just gonna have to defend himself in court and... Weasel his way out of it. Sarah, none of this is fair, or right, or your fault, or. In the Bible there's a story of a guy, Job, who had it rough. And when Job's friends saw how great his suffering was they put dust on their heads and said nothing for seven days and seven nights. Well it's 10:53, so you have seven minutes. It's gonna be okay. It'll be okay. This is all your fault. Kenny. You coming? No. I thought you liked horses. Not really. Suit yourself. Hey, how are you Dora? Yeah. Let me see how you did Britney. Nice. Much better today, you can take her out to the barn. Okay. Oh Kenny, good to see you. Stall five please. Yes Miss Felicity, real quick I just wanted you to meet someone. You know Pamela. - Hi. - Yeah hi. And this is my teacher Miss Bowdren. - Call me Melissa. - Good to meet Melissa. And this is Felicity Clawson, she runs Unbridled. How can I help you? Well it's about our friend Sarah Miller. She's just been moved to Gerald Honor's Safe Haven, she's scared and confused and Kenny here seems to think the horses have a cure. Oh yeah, the horses don't cure anyone. - I didn't mean to assume... - And unfortunately, I'm sorry we're full, I'm truly sorry about that. Kenny you should've asked. There are several other very effective programs that we can look into. Well, that's that. No ma'am. No? No, we'll get her in. Hello. Ronda, hey, how are you? It seems like it was just yesterday that you and Sebastian were out here scraping the fences. Oh. That's wonderful news. Is it a boy or girl? Okay. Here let me give you a number. I want you to give The Morning Center a call and schedule a free ultrasound and a healthy baby screening. Okay, how's things? Yeah I know, I've been there. You need to build on a solid foundation. The most important thing for kids is that they see that you are in love. Promise me this, if your marriage is ever in trouble. I want you to look up Mort Fratell, let him help you get back on track. He's the best. Alright. Talk soon. Hmm, hi. This is my fault Felicity. And I'm truly sorry but if this program really works it could save her life. And unfortunately we're full. I have an awful lot of work to do. I mean, you could check back in a few weeks, I mean things might change. Miss Felicity there must be a way. Hi. Well I'll be. No one does what you just did. Dreamer's deeply wounded. What happened to him? Starved, beaten. He was betrayed. He kicked down a stall and then was hit by a truck. He's been impossible to place with any of our students. That's one tough horse. I want him to be mine. Sarah, this isn't gonna be easy. There's no bailing out if you can't hack it in a few weeks. He needs someone that's consistent. Even if you're sick and your entire world is crashing around you. Do you think you can do that? Yes. Alright. Tell your transfer you're staying. Thank you. The wheelbarrows outside. Someone show her what to do in the paddock. God please bring her back to me. Yeah. Since when do we make a collar without back up? What were you thinking? Now someone's posted a lovely YouTube video. I want your bag and your gun on my desk by morning. You, okay, what am I supposed to do now? County needs rehab coaches. Denton's your guy. Look, I know Alison's your baby, you let your emotions get involved and now the girls trail is three months cold. Get your head in the game, then we'll talk. Hi ladies. My name is Cassie Davis and I am the Equine Director here. A lot of these horses have a difficult time trusting humans so that's where you come in. Because of your help these horses can learn how to trust again. Right? Our five key pillars are riding, scholastic, vocational, therapy and mentorship. You will gain knowledge and develop behaviors that are necessary for you to pursue the things that are important to you. Whatever that looks like. It could be your career, going to college, having healthy and good relationships, maybe starting a family. Yeah, how long's it take to get all that huh? Most of the girls stay for high school but we can usually tell within six weeks whether or not the programs gonna be beneficial for them. A lot of the girls wash out. Don't worry, we're gonna start with small tasks and then progressively work you towards more difficult tasks with the horses, with people and ultimately yourselves. So let me introduce to you Felicity Clawson, our Director. Thank you Cassie. How are you today ladies? Good. - Lindsey! - Hey. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. It's so awesome to be here, thanks for having me. Oh, I had to get out of the truck, have a nice stretch. You should have seen how many donuts I ate on the drive. Oh don't worry, we all have our fair share of road trip food. Oh, I have a favor to ask you. I totally forgot to bring the Gastra. Do you have any that I could borrow? But it's gotta be Omega-Alpha. Oh totally, we have plenty, just take whatever you need. That's awesome, thank you so much. What do you want me to talk about today? I don't know, maybe your award winning Championship ways. You're too nice. Don't worry, the girls are just excited that you're here. Do you wanna meet them? Sure, yeah, they're this way? - Yep. - Okay. No matter what you've been through, you can overcome it. You'll be paired with a rescued horse who will become your friend and your confidante. You're also gonna have various barn chores like cleaning, and feeding and caring for the horses. Then once your barn chores are finished, you'll be able to spend more time with your horse. You're expected to maintain and improve your grades, be honest and respectful to everyone or you will not last in this program. Ladies, welcome to the herd. Now since some of you listened, I would like to introduce to you a Natural Horsemanship Championship Freestyle Lindsey Partridge and her beautiful horse Soar. Hey girls, this is Soar. She won the freestyle and the trail competition and then won the overall title of America's Most Wanted Thoroughbred. I want to share with you how I re-trained this racehorse to be the calm and connected partner that she is. So who knows what harmony horsemanship means? Harmony horsemanship means learning to understand yourself, your horse, and the language that connects you. Once we can be calm, confident and communication focused we can learn to connect and get in balance with the horse and then we can learn to ride unbridled. Karen, the group home is fine. How's Unburgled Riding Academy? Unbridled. And the orientation was fine, the other girls are fine, I'm fine. Honey, I miss you awful bad. I'm gonna get things together, I promise. Yeah okay, I gotta go. Okay, bye. Okay, who's with me? Hey Sarah, come and watch. Can I change first Miss Felicity? Uh no, you gotta get used to that. You see what the girls are doing? They are talking to the horses to build their trust. It's the second phase. Um, and what's the first phase? It's all over your clothes sweetie. How's the relationship Stacy? I'm working on it. Are you connecting? Why not? Because I had a big fight with my mom this morning and I'm still mad about it. They know. So why don't you tell him about it? You have to be open. Cassie, what's Cameron's goal? To focus on her breathing and stay calm. How's the going Cameron? Well, I feel a lot less anxious, so much better than yesterday. Outstanding work. Mary, how's Malakai today? He's not actually biting me today, but I'm onto his tricks, so it's better than yesterday. That's good. Ow! What's so funny Ninita? What you think you can do better? Oh you think I'm funny? Mary, we all laughed. I laughed. Sarah might have the same trouble as you. So I want you to get with her and show her what we do here. Miss Felicity. Mary, do you want a chip? We will be a team. That girl, she's covered in, stuff. Alright, it's disgusting. You were covered in it too on your first day, okay. You remember that? Miss Felicity, she hasn't said a word to us, why should we talk to her? Stacy let's think about why we would feel for a new horse but not a new girl okay? Well, maybe she just isn't ready. Right Miss Felicity? Yeah, 'cause horses are people too. Alright girls, come on let's get changed for group. Thanks. So, are we having fun yet? No. You ready to pack it in? Like what? For the day or for the whole thing? Whichever. Bring extra clothes next time. Yeah. Welcome to my world Ninita. Look, nobody ever helps me alright. But Miss Felicity says we're supposed to, so here you go. Bet on Sea Biscuit in the fourth race. Alright look, I don't got much horsey wisdom but uh, this usually helps me through. Do you know what to do with it? No, girl. Give it to your horse. Um, thanks for the shirt. Of course, have a seat. You don't have a pen and paper. Can somebody please offer Sarah a piece of paper? Here you go. Thanks. We have a new young lady joining us today, as you've seen. Her name is Sarah and she's coming to us from Safe Haven Honor Home. Can everybody please say hi to Sarah? Hi Sarah. Something funny Mary? Why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? Sarah, it's okay. Um, nothing right now. That's fine. Mary, how about you? How has your week been different? Well, I'm still the main champ in the ring. Ba, ba, ba ba. Yes you are. How about school? How's science going? Better, yeah. I mean I got a C+ on the test so. Yeah, I mean it's not great or anything. Mary, that is significant improvement. Really? Yeah I mean, you know, in a way, but, yeah I guess it is pretty good huh? Maybe next time Claire can help you study and you'll get that A okay. Yeah. The other things, have you been eating okay? Um, that's private. Herd only. Everyone here is part of the herd Mary. No they ain't. Aren't. Look, I don't know nothing about her. Alright? She's got no right to know about me. Alright fine. Stacy how about you? Have you talked to your mom? No. Did you send her the letter you were working on? No. Okay. It's really important to say you're sorry. Especially to the people that you love and especially after an incident. So maybe you can get working on that and send it to her this week? Stacy, like it's not like you have to forgive her, you know. Just tell her you're sorry. Maybe she ain't sorry, right? Wait... So why don't you just back off? Let's let Stacy speak for herself okay. Yeah. We'll come back to that. I feel bad about what I did. I scared her. I scared myself. She made me feel ugly. Let's order a sausage pizza. Sounds good. May I help you? Hi, um, yes I have this restraining order. Is this where the arrested people are kept? No, the jail is on Oak Street. Okay, this forms needs to be completely filled out with your date of birth. The horse feels your pain, so I want you to get in close to him and hold him as if you're hugging him. Like this? Nice. Now let's bring all of that energy and direct it forward. Ready and. Becky did something well, when the horse starts to chew and lick his lips it is him processing that he's discovered something, like a shazam moment. Good. There we go, now we're gonna take him down. Then we're bring him and his nose down, bring the direction of the energy down. Good. Okay stand up. Connect hold and bring him down. Good work. So Stacy, I know how you feel nervous. We in life, we feel nervous, but he is trustworthy so I want you to talk with him. Connect with him. What do I say? The pain you feel, the struggle you're going through in your mind. Communicate that with him. Tell him how you feel. I guess I'm hurting today. I'm thankful that you're listening. Thank you. Girls let's focus. I'm gonna count to three and it's gonna be a one, two, three fall, ready. So fall on fall. - I'm gonna catch you. - Here we go. One, two, three and fall. I'm gonna do this without freaking out okay. If she can do it, we all can do it. - You got me. - Yeah. - She's gonna catch you. - Yeah. It made me smile. I actually grew up on a farm. It's a lot of hard work, do you like it? It's okay, I shovel a lot. Oh yeah, snow? Miss Felicity said if I get here early enough I can try to mount Dreamer today. Oh that's exciting. I remember my first time riding a horse I was about 12. You go girl. Okay, go ahead Sarah. Hi Dreamer. Okay. Okay, slow down Sarah. Come on. You said I could mount him today. In theory yes, but we, we can't force anything. Well tell him that I've been picking up after him for weeks. I've done all my homework on time and I even got here really early, what am I doing wrong? Maybe you're trying to hard. See, horses teach us patience. Almost as much as humans. Hey ladies. - Hi. - Hey. So who's got something today? Anybody. I do. Go for it Ambrosia. Well, my gran's cancer came back and I wanted to see her before she went on her treatment, but my social worker said it wasn't a good idea, as long as my uncle was still there so. I just don't want her to think that I don't care, you know. So can we just pray for my gran? Yeah sure hun, we'll pray for full recovery and that she knows how much you love her and that you do care, even though you can't be there. I mean, it's not her fault, you know. I never really told about what happened with Uncle Phil. Your gran is a strong woman. She can beat this, she's gonna beat this. I really believe that God will carry you both through it. Hey that's a lie and you know it. If your granny loved you so much, she should have known and she would have stopped it. Sarah that's a chip. You don't have to participate, but you do have to be respectful. Sorry I have chores. I don't need group therapy. Okay, I just need something real. All the girls just laugh at me and whisper. Well, I was kind of mean. I lost my temper. Felicity's nice. I appreciate her trying. Cassie and Ambrosia too, they know what it's like. So do you. Hey handsome. I just want to let you know that I love you. And I'm sorry for all your pain. I'm your girl Dreamer, okay. I trust you. Alright, it looks like we got everybody. Let's go and have a seat. Just have a seat, it's real simple people. The sooner you sit down and we get started, the sooner I can get going, the sooner I can get done and the sooner you can get your kids back, maybe. Alright. Hello everyone my name is Detective Mitchell Sangrin, I moonlight here because I have the knowledge, expertise and degrees to do so. But mostly because I enjoy it. So that's why I'm here.

Roger won't bother us ever again, I promise. Well, give me a hug. I love you sweetheart. Hey. Your mom seems happy. Yeah, she's doing better. You wanna help me clean up. Yeah, sure. Okay. Why don't you go put a jacket on, it's cold out here. It always amazes me how much the parents make a bigger mess than even you girls. Yeah, parents are good at making messes, that's for sure. Ah, so I heard your mom got a new job? Sorry to eavesdrop. It's a bad habit of mine, one of many. Yeah, people like you are pretty much born perfect. So I'm pretty sure you never made a mistake your entire life. You seriously believe that? Well we all do, everyone says that you're this Champion rider who had this deep calling to give it all up to rehabilitate losers like me and him. Don't say losers. Come here Sarah. What I'm about to say is, is awkward, it's something I don't normally tell people because it's pretty embarrassing. We grew up in a trailer park until I was 15. My father died when I was 11 and my mom worked three jobs just to feed my brothers and me. And one day my oldest brother realized, that boys thought I was pretty. And that they would pay for. I don't know if my mom ever really knew what was going on. But the truth was, she was never there. I'm sorry. And she, she spent the money and she never once asked where it came from. Did your brother go to jail? No, neither did my mom. Without my testimony there wasn't enough to prove anything. And it wasn't as if the John's were lining up to tell their story. But there was enough evidence to get me awarded to the State and that's how I came here. What? Yep. Beatrice Dolan, she used to run this place. Old and crotchety. Yeah, but you knew she cared. I told myself and God that if I survived I'd come back here and work with the girls. And here we are. Wow. So I came home from work to find my son up on the garage. Get out of the car, there's a trampoline set up, outside the fence to the pool. Now, when I looked at him I knew that there was no way, that if he jumped he was gonna hit that pool. It would've been cement. So instead of getting mad, I instructed him to learn more mathematics and psychics. Sorry ma'am, you're late. I can't give you credit for tonight. What? Wait, I. I'm five minutes late, I mean can't you let it pass this one time. I'm sorry it's the rules. But I just came from parents day at my daughters therapy group. That's great, I hope she's doing well. But you're now wasting our time. Are you serious? You can participate, but you won't get credit for today. Unbelievable. People listen, this isn't about you. We are here to talk about our... Roger. Roger. When you're feeling ready ladies, ask your horses to trot. Ease into it Cameron. Whoa, I think I ate too much for this ride. Don't, don't crowd each other. Make sure you're mindful of the space between your horses. Alright bring it in. Hey where's Mary? I don't know, maybe she's doing her hair or something. Cassie help! That's all for today ladies. Mary no, no! Stacy outside right now. Let us know when the ambulance gets here. This isn't her fault. Outside Stacy, now. Come on Stacy. Come on girls go. Come on Mary. Okay, come here. Run with me. Good boy. Hey. Hey, thanks for meeting with me. Yeah no problem. I wanna get this guy. - Yeah. - And I have a plan. Okay. I think we should use Karen to try and... She's already working with us. Alright, look kid we don't have a lot of time. Alright, what we got? Here she comes. Sarah, go ahead and tell him. I overheard Roger before we went on that trip. He was on the phone and he mentioned something about an African. He said absolutely spectacular with perfect skin. - That's Alison. - He didn't say a name. Doesn't matter. She's still alive, I know it. Do you think Alison is even alive? I really hope so. How's Mary? She lost a lot of blood but Felicity says she's gonna be okay. That's good to hear. Yeah. I don't know if she's coming back or not though. She was kind of mean to you wasn't she? Yeah. She was. But she's part of my herd. What? Herding horses buck and kick, but sometimes freedom does come. That's pretty heavy. When did you get so dreamy? Just stop talking okay. I got a plan. Okay. Steel trap. Karen, are you almost done with that transcript? Yeah, yes, I'll be just a minute. What did we say about the glasses? I'm sorry Miss Sandler. Look, I have a new client coming in a few minutes, can you please hurry. Yes ma'am. Hmm. Take your time my love. Roger. Roger? Hey baby. Roger, what are you doing here? How did, how did you find me? I came to see my attorney, I got in a little bit of trouble, she's the best. You can't be here, you have to go. Oh Doll, I can go if you want me too... Or... What is it? No. You have to open it and find out. Oh Roger, it's beautiful. You're too pretty to work for a living. It's good to see you Karen. Hello Karen, I'm Gerald Honor, Director of Safe Haven. I'm excited by the things I've heard about Sarah at the Academy, and all you've done with your classes, well done Karen. Thank you. So, I'm going to go find Sarah. We've told her what today is about and she's... She's what? Happy? Overjoyed? Of course she's coming home. This is her decision Karen and then there's still the issue of Roger. No, I've already fixed that. Roger's not gonna bother us ever again. Am I in trouble? No baby, you're coming home tonight. Your mother's filed for custody and if everything goes well, then it could be permanent. What do you think about that Sarah? You still have a say in all of this. No one's gonna force you to go back home. Wait a minute, that's not helping. She's drinking again. Those are her hangover glasses. No. So either go back there and wait for Roger to show up or I continue living at Safe Haven? That really stinks. What would you all do? Well I guess I'd pick the place I felt the most safe. No matter what? Right now, focus on Sarah. She knows it's not safe. Oh baby come on. You know what he did to me Karen. Look what he's done to you. I wanna stay at the group home and continue my lessons at the Academy. No, no, no Sarah. Look at me. What are you saying? Sarah, please, I need you. I had needs too Karen. Sarah. I'm sorry. You're sorry? I hope you're satisfied. Ji....... Hey, cold tonight huh? Yeah I know. Come on Dreamer, come on boy, let's go for a walk. You wanna go for a run? Oh, hold on boy, come here. Let me fix that for you. Let me get a peg real quick. Let me just fix that here boy, come on. There you go. There you go, hey. There you go. Okay, okay come on, let's go. Let's go boy.

Alright get in. Dreamer. You act up, they die. You better behave. A beautiful apple. A beautiful girl. Gotta share with the class. Such a sweetie pie. Something's wrong. Hello. Karen, it's Mitchell. What's wrong with you? Oh, I tried to warn you, I'm sorry. He knocked me out, he's gone, I'm so sorry. Are you kidding me? Sarah, anybody else hurt? Let's go, let's go right now. Let's go. Put your hands behind your back. Hands behind your back. Ah, ah you do those things too tight. Let's go. Sarah, stay right there. Kenny. - Kenny you okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Hey baby. - She's okay. I think she's just drugged up. Alison, sweetie are you okay? That's it sweetie, come here. Can you help with the door? - Yeah I'll get the door. - Get the door. This is Detective Sangrin, I need an ambulance at 40 East Flowers. Got a crash, multiple injuries. I need an ambulance right now. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm gonna get you out. Thank you man. Get the door. I love you honey, we'll be together forever. You haven't got the guts. I own you. Sarah. Sarah what are you doing? Go away Kenny. Sarah don't do this. Sarah, no, no, no, no, no, Sarah. Sarah put the gun down. Leave me alone! - Please don't do this Sarah. - It's okay, Sarah it is okay. Let me take care of it, okay. Put the gun down Sarah. I said go away. There are others, don't move. There are other girls, we need him. There are other girls. Think about the other girls you can help. Put the gun down Sarah. He's not worth it. Sarah, I know how you feel. Drop the gun. Turn around, let's go. Hey. Hey baby. I'm sorry. You're okay though right? Yeah. You're okay. You're okay. So tell me what do you feed Dreamer? Kenny, I wanna say thank you for bringing Sarah here. These little um, these cookies. So Alison, you'll be back in school next semester. That's really great. That's wonderful, this will be a safe place for you. 'Cause you're a survivor. We're here anytime you wanna talk about your story. Do you ride horses? I don't know, they are awfully big. I'm so proud of you. I'm glad it's over. Done with him. And done with the bottle too. You protected me, and looked out for me mom. Oh Sarah, baby. All I ever wanted to do was save you. I, I just couldn't figure out how. He told me over text that if we testify that we'll be sorry. But, just in case, you're wondering we are gonna put him away, forever. Yes, we are. And we'll both be coming home for the first time. Uh, Sarah wanna go for a walk? Yes. Here, watch this. There you go. All the way. Wow. So when will you get to ride him again? The vet said he'll be good as new in about six weeks. Well you're gonna need alternate transportation until then. This guy'll work as a good substitute. You know that those with horses are the sources of life that forces us to... What did we say about the math?
