So peaceful here. - It's something, huh? - Sure is. Now, your sister's bed and breakfast is gonna bring those people in here and trample on all this tranquility. Listen, dad, imagine all these people from the city never experienced a morning like this. You know, we're giving them something special. It's a good thing, I promise. Yeah, well I'll try to think of it it like that. Okay. I'll do my best! - Morning, sheriff. - Good morning, John. - What do you think? - Oh, I think you missed your calling, Rembrandt. Hey, can you do me a favor? Make sure the whole family is home at one o'clock today. - Why's that? - You'll see. Ohh. Well, if it's, uh... It's what I think it is, it's about time. Wow, it's a good thing I'm all alone. I can have my morning coffee in peace. - Ahh! - Ha! - Ah! - Looking for me? - Not fair. How'd you know? - Well, there's something you gotta know about your grandfather. I'm a ninja. But, you're a cowboy... cowboys can't be ninjas. I'm gonna tell everyone at the cowboy-ninja convention that you said that. You want some breakfast, fellas? - I do! - Okay. - Shoot... nowhere... - Well, what are you looking for? - Frying pan. - No, I'm sorry, but the kitchen is off limits, I just cleaned it. The bed & breakfast magazine reviewers are coming tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Honey, we gotta eat. - Yeah, well, here. We've got a lot to prepare for today, and I don't feel like cleaning the kitchen again. Now, everything has to be perfect. Honey, I'm still not too keen on strangers staying here. No, no, don't say that to me. People want that country-living experience, and we can offer it to 'em, and in return, they can offer US their money, which we sorely need. Okay, it's your rodeo. Now, you can get the breakfast of your dreams, look. The one you're always asking for, right? You got it. Two for you, big guy. Enjoy, boys. There's only one thing tougher than a ninja. That's a mother. What's wrong, daddy? My boots, uh, I just put 'em here. - Uh, check the closet. - Honey. My boots have lived in this spot for 40 years. Well, now they have a new home, on the shoe rack, - in the closet. - Shoe rack? Yeah, these reviewers have been known to be very thorough. Honey, don't stress these magazine people. You and Becca have done a fine job remodeling this house. Your mother would be proud. Yeah, well I just need everybody on their best behavior - for tomorrow. - I'll get the word out. - Uh, hat rack. - Hat rack? Hm. - Dad. - Hey. We have a hat rack. Don't, don't come traipsing through here with muddy shoes. Listen, I came to clock out, boss. Well, I appreciate your help, but I could use - another hour from ya. - He has a real job, Regan. Thank you, Henry, go save US from the bad guys. Yes, ma'am. - Mom, why isn't she eating? - I don't know. Yeah, momma's gotta get her to eat now. - Well, which one is her momma? - That'd be you, sweetheart. You're her momma, it's your horse. Gotta get her to eat, you're gonna have to get - the vet up here, okay? - Okay. - Did ya check her teeth? - Yep, they're healthy. - Here. - What is this? Molasses. Might whet her appetite. It's what we had to do with you when you were a kid... Put honey on your vegetables in order to get you to eat 'em. - I remember that. - Well, your grandma - taught her that. - Mhm, my mom knew - all the tricks, huh? - She sure did. I miss grandma. Yeah, me too. - Get at it, sweetheart. - Okay. - All right. - Okay, thanks for the molasses, - gramps. - Don't give her too much. I won't. Lynnie's still dwelling on her daddy? Oh yeah, still going on about finding him, she's stubborn. Yeah, well she's a landsburg and a Peterson, she's a thoroughbred of stubborn. I just don't know what to tell her. Well, even if he is still alive, if he ain't shown up by now, chances are he ain't showing up. Now Lynnie can keep running in circles, that's her business. She can dwell on it, or she can move on, - and that's the same for you. - Well, I'm not dwelling on Caleb anymore, dad, he's long gone. Gone. I got Henry to dwell on now. Yes, you do. - Okay. - Okay. I won't bring it up again. - Love you, daddy. - Love you. - May I help you? - Claudia and Frederic dupri. B&b magazine. Oh! Oh, um... Sorry! Right, right, no, I just... I was under the impression y'all were coming tomorrow. I did say we were coming tomorrow, but I've found that the element of surprise allows for the most authentic review. I'm sure it does. Well, I am Regan landsburg, and if y'all don't mind waiting out here a spell. I'll be right back to give you a tour. Can I get y'all some iced tea or something? Iced teas would be great, thank you. You have an interesting layout here. Well, I hope "interesting" is a good thing. - Not necessarily. - Okay then. Well, I'll be right back with those iced teas. Y'all make yourselves completely at home. Thank you. Tony, why can I not get the sandwich the way I...? We have a code 7 at... - Will you turn that up? - All units to the landsburg ranch. Code 7. - What's a code 7? - Never heard it before. "All units." Sounds bad. Rebecca landsburg, come out! Dad, the b&b people are here today. - Today? - Yes. I repeat: Rebecca landsburg, - come out with your hands up! - Is that Henry? - Is it one o'clock already? - Yeah, why? - Then yep, it's Henry. - Ugh! They are right out front. Ugh! I'll get Becca. Rebecca landsburg, will you please come out with your hands up? - Brady, have you seen Becca? - Well, last I saw she rode out to get the mail. Get this, pop. Tap Peterson's here. - Where? - Right out front. He's got a rifle. I repeat: Rebecca landsburg, please come out with your hands up! I'm sorry for all the commotion. There's a perfectly good explanation. Here's your, uh... Here's your lemonade. - I thought you said iced tea. - I did, didn't I? Sorry about that. He's got a gun! Welcome to the country experience. Get off my property, tap. Tell me what the heck's going on here. - Doesn't concern you. Move out. - Come on, John, settle down. The man brings a rifle onto my property, - on my land... - Oh, don't start - the "my land" garbage... - I got kids in this house! - Let me tell you something... - Something happen to you? Let me tell you something. I heard there was a problem - out here... - Oh, you came out here to help? Is that what you're trying to tell me? - "Code 7" is what I heard. - Code 7... he doesn't know, but that's Henry... He's a good guy. What is all the commotion? What's going on, Henry? No, I ain't saying anything to you, John. Oh, hey, that's a new one, isn't it? - No, I didn't come out to... - Code 7 is our lunch break. - Excuse me? - Code 7 is our lunch break. - Code 7's your lunch break? - Yes, sir. I don't know what's the matter with you people. - Your lunch break. - Yeah, come by anytime. You have yourself a nice lunch, ma'am. That was weird. I'll be right back, I'm gonna get you the drinks I promised you, and don't worry about a thing. That was just one of our neighbors. Hey, what is going on? What is all this commotion? Tell her, Henry. Well, now it ain't right. Forget it, this was all just a big misunderstanding. Becca, come on down here. Brady. Henry's got something to say. Okay, fine. - I guess I'm doing this. - Yeah, ya are. Uh, so, beccs. - Yeah? - We've known each other our whole lives. Well, not actually our whole lives... Pretty close to it. Anyway, so... Beccs, we've known each other our whole lives... You know what I mean... Since 6th grade... 7th... was it 7th? - Henry, are you okay? - What I'm trying to say is... We've known each other our whole lives. Take a knee, sheriff. Trust me. Beccs, I've always loved you, and I always dreamed about being your wife... Husband! Dang it! Let me start over: Beccs, we've known each other our whole lives, - and I've always... - Yes, Henry. - Yes, what? - Yes, I'll marry you. You will? I guess I should've done something a little more subtle. Well, this was memorable. Honey, this guy make ya happy? He does, he really does. Well, that's all a daddy could want. - Let's have a wedding. - All right! Let's have a wedding! - Oh boy, I... - I love you. Please, can't I show y'all round just a little bit more? Please, we need this. Ya aren't all leaving, are ya? I'm afraid so. Safety is the number one concern for our readers. - Well... - Well, no, I grew up here, - and I'm still alive. - Yeah, see? Look, what y'all saw was a big elaborate proposal. My daughter Becca is getting married. - He finally asked you! - He tried! So, why don't you stick around? I'm not sure your place is ready for that yet. Maybe we can come back next year, - and check on your progress. - Listen, my kids and my grandkids worked their tails off to make this house ready for you all. Now, I apologize if I frightened you with the rifle and all. That was my fault... my fault... - And I am sorry. - We appreciate your apology. Thank you. And now, we're gonna have a big brunch to celebrate the happy occasion, right? Let US at least feed ya before ya head off. It's the... it's the country way. What do you say, Frederic? We don't wanna go against the country way. No, of course not. - We can stay a little while. - Oh, thanks! - Come on. - I hope you brought your appetites. - Beautiful, beautiful biscuit. - You gotta be on your best behavior. Your mother's counting on ya. - What are we missing, y'all? - Oh gosh, that's hot. Ms. Claudia, would you mind going and grabbing that basket of eggs over there that Brady's got his - grubbies all over? - Sure. - Thank you. - Here ya go... jeez! If there's one thing my family likes to do, it is eat. Where'd ya get these eggs? They're huge. Those eggs come from Doris, Nancy, buella, and pepper. And don't forget Princess pecky! "Princess pecky" guess who named that one. - Me. - All right. Everything you see here, it comes from here, except for the oranges, those, I'm pretty sure come from Florida. Frederic, write that down, this is all farm-to-table. I've been writing everything down. This is impressive. - This is the last of the steak... - Hand me a biscuit please! Thank you, pop. - Yum. - Oh yes. Hey, you know, I should say something. When Henry first took over for me as sheriff of this town, I didn't think he was gonna last a day. And then, he started hanging out with my very independent daughter, and I gave him a week tops. I don't like being wrong, but I'm happy to say that I grossly underestimated the staying power of this man. Here's to Henry, and, of course, to Rebecca. - Thank you for that, dad. - Here's to Rebecca. - Here, here! - Yes. - Aw. - Mm. You should say something. Honey, you've got this. All these years, you've been the family I never had. Now, I'm finally making it official. I love Rebecca, but I also love all of you. So, to family. - Cheers! - Family! Claudia. Let's eat! So, how long you been in this magazine thing? Well, it's all Frederic's thing really, he started the magazine 25 years ago, and I'm retired now, so I help him out whenever I can. Well, that's a good thing, you know. Keeps the marriage strong. No, we're not married. - Oh? - Frederic's my brother. Oh... that's good. I mean, that's nice. Have a brother in the business. Um, so, Ms. Claudia, what did you do before... Before you retired? - I was a party planner. - Oh. I did a lot of high-end events, bar mitzvahs, weddings, birthday parties. It was fun, it was a lot of fun. - She was the best. - Well, that's perfect, 'cause we're gonna need a wedding planner. No, I'm sorry, after my divorce, I quit the business, and hit the road with Frederic. Where are you having the wedding? Oh my goodness, I don't know. Guess that's something you and I have to talk about, huh, Henry? I just hope it goes smoother than my proposal. - Well, that won't take much. - You should really have the wedding here, it's beautiful. Oh, well, I don't know. Well, it's something to think about. - What do you think, daddy? - Well, she's the expert, but, uh... Well, it's not my decision. It's Henry and Rebecca. I say let's do it. When? Oh my goodness, Henry, well, I don't know. Summer? The next spring of some... I mean... I'm ready to be your husband right now. Far as I'm concerned, sooner the better. - Okay. - You know, on the 6th, would've been, uh, your mom and i's anniversary? So, why don't ya have it then? Share the date. Oh, well, daddy, we'd be honored, but, um, that's in a month. Oh, come on, Becca. It doesn't get any more perfect than that. Yeah, you know, beccs, if mom was here, I think she'd love that idea. Okay... let's do it. Oh my goodness. I have to take this. Hey, did you find anything? So, your dad actually did a really good job of covering up his tracks over the years. Do you know if he went by a different name other than Caleb Peterson ever? No, not that I know of. I'll do a deep dive, and the good thing is nobody can disappear these days. Thanks, Jeremy. Well, I got to get to some chores now. It was so nice of you to stay. - Very good to meet ya. - Mind if I tag along? Well, it's just chores, I couldn't ask you to do that. Why, because I'm a woman? No, I... I... I raised two strong, independent daughters. So, look, if you... Sure, come along. Okay, let's do it. I'm just giving ya a hard time. Frederic, you wanna come? - Oh no. - Can we take the horses? - Do you ride? - It's been a while, but yeah. Well, she can take my horse, daddy, she's still all saddled up. - Great, thanks. - You're welcome. - Okay. - Let's do it. Have fun, daddy! I had to hold that back... I like your sister. I don't think we've seen our daddy squirm in, how long? - She's frisky now. - I like frisky. Leg up. - Thank you, sir. - Okay. You look pretty good up there. Look at this... You have nice, light hands. - Aw, thanks. - Yeah, most people say - they can ride, they can't ride. - Oh, I just love 'em so much. - Yeah. - Thank you for letting me ride her. So, are you all good with this, me and Henry? Yeah, mom, I'm happy for you. You love him, right? Yeah, I do, he makes me feel safe, we understand each other... That's important when you get older. Trust me, girlfriend. Did you love my father? We were practically kids. Lynnie, it was something different. What was he like? Been a long time, babe. - You never wanna talk about it. - Honey. I get it... he's the son of tap Peterson, but he left before he even knew about me. Maybe if he knew, he'd wanna be in my life. I'm not going to pretend like he doesn't exist, mom, - because he's a Peterson. - I don't want you to pretend he doesn't exist, Lynnie, I just don't want you - to be disappointed. - Do you ever wonder where he went, and what kind of life he led? Sure, I think about him sometimes. But, you know what? Henry is here. - Henry has always been here. - I'm not trying to talk you out of Henry. I like Henry. Everybody likes Henry. Yeah, and Henry likes you, for some strange reason. I'm happy for you, mom. I'm happy too, sweetheart. Bring it in. - I love you. - I love you, mom. - Oh no. - What? Oh no, I have lost my ring. - I've been doing chores... - Okay, okay, okay. - No, no, this is bad. - Don't panic. No, don't panic, we'll find it. - Okay, come on now. - We'll find it. - We got it, we got it. - Come on. Here we go... good. - You're stronger than you look. - So are you. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. Okay, I'm gonna tack this up... I been here this morning. - Can you hold that against that? - Yep. There. - Good. - So, what's next? - Next I fix the fence. - What, am I just supposed to just sit around and watch you do all the work? Well, I been mending fences since I was eight years old. - Ain't gonna take very long. - That's a shame. That man with the gun. What's that all about? Oh, that's tap Peterson. There's an old running feud between our families. - Like the hatfields and mccoys? - Something like that. Well, things didn't turn out so great for them. No, it didn't. But, you know, the sad part is it's all based on lies, and nothing true about it. Those lies have been passed down... Caused a lot of ugliness. So, what's keeping the fires going? Well... Tap Peterson's a tough nut to crack. I wish I could make it right. I don't wanna pass it down to another generation. The lives we've been given, huh? And the people in 'em. It's a mystery. All we can do is try to do the right thing every day. When we fail, we just have to pick ourselves up and try again. Whoa, I like you. I like you too. Does that mean, uh, we're gonna get a glowing report - in that magazine of yours? - Oh, is that what this is about? - You're just buttering my bread? - Well, you didn't know that? Yeah. Excuse me! Could you by chance point US to the jl ranch - bed and breakfast? - Keep going till you hit - the first driveway. - All right, thank you, sir! Okay, here's your key, and you just let US know - if you need anything. - The only thing we need right now is a nap, we drove through the night. - Oh, where are y'all from? - Chicago. All right, well, thanks for making the trip, and we'll try to keep it down for you, okay? - Okay. - So, it's just upstairs, - second door on the right. - Okay, thank you. Yeah, my boys will help you with the bags. Take it easy, boys! - First guests. - Really? What about - Frederic and me? - Aw, well, y'all don't really count... I mean, you're not even staying the night, so... Of course we are. How can we do a proper review if we don't actually stay here? - Really? That'll be great. - Yes. All right, I'll have my boys get your rooms ready. Thank you. You made my daughter happy. Come on, I'll... I'll help you with your bags. Oh my goodness. Ahh, sorry I'm late. It's all right. Jerry granville hit a fire hydrant with his car. - Jerry still drives? - That's the problem. He's 102, hasn't had his license in 20 years. - No. - I should've proposed here. We've been coming here for how long? Would've been beautiful, but all that matters is we're getting married, right? I, um... I do have one thing to confess though, I uh... - What? - I lost the ring. I just... it was a little big, I didn't wanna say anything. It must've come off during morning chores, honey, I... - It's okay... not a big deal. - It is a big deal! You paid good money for this ring. Well, technically my great grandfather - spent good money on it. - It's a family heirloom? Henry, that's even worse! I am so sorry! This engagement isn't getting off to a great start, is it? I'm gonna find it, I promise. Oh, Rebecca, it's fine. - Hopefully you'll find it. - I am. If not, doesn't change anything. A ring is a thing. A thing is just... a thing. Well, thank you, Dr. Seuss. A ring is a thing, but it's a nice thing. I'm gonna find it, okay? I love you. You know what else are also a thing? - Sandwiches. I'm starving. - Oh, I'm sorry! Here you go, how about that? Made with love. - Mr. Tap Peterson. - That's right, who are you? My name is Todd haplar. I work with the Mayfair hotel and casino in Atlantic city. - What's your business? - I'm here to collect on a sizable debt that was accrued by a Cory price. But I think you know him by his birth name: Caleb Peterson. - Why would you come to me? - Because you're a man of considerable means, and Caleb's not. Well, I don't even know if my son's alive. Oh, he's very much alive. I need a loan for $2 million. We're a small town bank. We can't get you the money you're asking for. I can approve for you $200,000. If you need more, think about liquidating some assets. So, I have this ranch that I love, and I love to run it, and you want me to sell that off, - is that what you're saying? - How about the co-op? They have emergency funds set aside for these type situations. - Uh-huh. - I know you and John have had your differences, but he's a fair man. Every rancher in the county has been where you're at. Even the landsburgs. Set aside your pride, and just ask him. I'd rather take a poison pill. I'll see you later. Grandpa. Hey, little one, what ya doing here? - Can we talk? - Can we talk? Sure. - Of course. - My mom hasn't told me much about him. - Can you? - Let's start with the beginning, like, he was a little brat kid, like most of y'all. I mean, we spoiled him a little bit, but he was a great little kid. Full of energy, getting into trouble, like most them kids as you grow older... Trouble, you know... He was a good boy. - I just can't help it. - What? I believe he's still alive, grandpa. Do you know where I can find him? - Nice, Brady. - Brady, woo! - Yeah! - Got some real talent - in the family. - Thank y'all, thank y'all. - You can sing 'em. - So, we have a wedding to plan on this very spot in a month, so how are we gonna pull that off, y'all? We can keep it simple. As long as we have our friends and family here, we'll be fine. Now, that is a typical man thing to say. But, I wanna hear from Claudia, 'cause she used to do this for a living, so what do we need? You need a tent. You need catering, tables, chairs, decorations, flowers. You'll need music for the ceremony and the reception, someone to preside over the ceremony. Honestly, that's just the basics. - You're gonna need a lot more. - Sounds about right. And Henry, you need to start thinking about who your best man is gonna be, but you just take your time, and choose from your heart. Brady? - Is that cool? - Yeah, man. - Cool. - Cool. Oh, we're dealing with cavemen. - Yeah, see? - Claudia, are you sure that you won't stay and help US with this wedding? If my sister takes care of all of it, she's gonna drive US insane. Well, you know, that's fair. We'll give you room and board, take good care of you, - right, daddy? - I'd love to have you. I mean, we'd all like to have your expertise around here. Sorry, but I promised Frederic that I'd finish up this issue. Oh, you can stay. But you have to write the review for this place. You can have my marshmallow if you stay, Ms. Claudia. Oh my gosh! How can a girl turn down a marshmallow from such a handsome fellow? Bye, honey. - Hey. - Hey, grandpa. - You going somewhere? - Yeah, just a small road trip. - Your mother know? - No, I'll just... I'm gonna call her from the road. Something you wanna talk about? You promise you won't tell anyone? - Okay. - I may have a lead to where my dad is. I'm not sure, but I'm going to go check it out. Well, that's... That's the exciting thing about being an adult. Make your own decisions. How's your horse? Yeah, much better, the molasses works. Yeah, well you learned your first lesson about being a parent: Be there for 'em. You don't think I should be looking for him? I didn't say that. Just remember who was there for you. Yeah, I know. I know that he wasn't here. But maybe if he knew that I existed, he would be here like y'all were. Brady, just the man I need. - What's up, pop? - Listen, how would you like to take a little road trip with your niece here? Oh, gramps, I'm sure he's got things to do around here. Give me peace of mind knowing that you're not alone, honey. Yeah, all right. When we leaving? - As soon as possible. - I'll take care of this, and go get my stuff. John? - Uh-oh. - I wanna put chandeliers up in the barn, and I found a guy who will give US a really good price, but, um, it's gonna be a little bit more than we budgeted for. You are so pretty. - What? - Did you hear anything I just said? Oh... chandeliers! - Chandeliers, right? - Yeah. Yeah, well, you think we need 'em? I trust you, do what you gotta do. Great, thanks. How do you think we're doing so far? - Here? - Well, I can't tell you that. You're gonna have to buy the magazine to find out. Oh, come on. Do you think we got what it takes? Um, jury's still out. But you could help your case with a minor bribe. Oh, your jury takes bribes, does it? You know, perhaps if you were to show a girl around town a bit. Oh, you don't think that's gonna mess with your journalistic integrity? - I'll take my chances. - Okay, then you got a deal... If you don't mind sitting through a town hall meeting first. - Ooh. - Hey, daddy! I'm sorry to interrupt. Have you... have you seen Lynnie? She's not answering her phone. Yeah, she went on a little road trip with Brady. She did? Okay, when did they leave? This morning, she said she was gonna... gonna call you. But she's with Brady, so she's fine. Okay, well she did not call me, what a surprise. Okay, thank you, um... Again, sorry to... interrupt. So, you gonna tell me why we're going - all the way up to beaumont? - I... - I found my dad. - That's what this is all about, Lynnie? You should've told me, that puts me in a really tough spot. You know, you're gonna have to tell her at some point. Yeah, I know, but you know how mom is. She'll try to talk me out of it. - I'm doing this. - She is gonna be so mad at me. Look, I'll take the heat. Just please don't say anything yet. Okay. You have an impressive property. Well, thank you, ma'am. I was surprised you came to US. Me too. So, am I gonna get the loan or not? Of course. It's just a matter of cost. Of course. I know well exactly how you people do business. - I've done it with you before. - Good. We're a private lending group, so we can set our own terms. 15 percent interest. You have 21 days. Your land is your collateral. If you cannot repay US in 21 days, then your property will be ours. - Vultures. - Do we have a deal, Mr. Peterson? Oh yes... we have a deal. Well, it's just not like Lynnie to disappear like this. - That's all I'm saying. - Beccs, as much as you don't wanna admit it, - Lynnie is her own woman. - Yeah. She ain't like US. When's the last time you left this town? I went to, uh... I went to Benton. Hey, you shush your mouth! When was the last time you went anywhere? Why would I wanna go anywhere else? Ah, you're so funny. We just know what we like. Lynnie's young and adventurous. Nothing wrong with that. Yeah. Maybe we should go somewhere for our honeymoon. Oh my gosh, I forgot people actually go on honeymoon. Where would we go? I don't know. Maybe, uh, someplace exotic. I've always wanted to go to the corn palace - up in Mitchell. - South Dakota, that is pretty exotic. To some people it is. I was thinking maybe the Maldives. - The Maldives? - Yeah. You got surprises all over the place. I saw it on this documentary, they got these huts you can stay in built right on top of the water. Yeah... yeah. As long as I'm with you, wherever we are, I'm happy. - Pretty nice. - Mhm, you are pretty nice. Look, tap, I don't think you're gonna sell the whole herd. Nobody around here can afford it. Well... Then we just lower the reserve. Just sell everything... Hell, sell our horses too, except... except mine. Any other business to come before the council? - Here. - Would you step forward please? I have it on good word that tap Peterson's auctioning off all his livestock. - You know, I heard that too. - Is that true, John? - Is he downsizing? - I haven't heard anything. If it closes up, we're all in trouble. Okay, hold it. Let's lighten up here... Listen, if the man wants to sell a few things, that's his business. Let's just find out a little something first before we get so excited. Oh, and last but not least, I'd like to mention, Rebecca and I are engaged. You're all invited to the wedding. It'll be on the sixth of next month out at the landsburgs'. We're getting so close. I've been waiting my whole life to meet my dad. Do you know what you're gonna say to him? I have no clue. You know, you should have a plan, Lynnie. You don't want your emotions to get the best of ya. You don't wanna end up like Henry when he proposed to your mom. I just wanna see him first, and then I'm hoping it will all become clear. Well, I know I've got a few things - I'd like to say to him. - Brady, you promised. I don't want you scaring him away. Okay, I'll keep my mouth shut. For now. So, how's the wedding planning going? Good, and I've already started on a few things. - It's time to order the tent. - Tent? Why do we need a tent for? I thought we were gonna use the backyard, yeah? Murphy's law: If there's no tent, it will rain. Ah, good to know. However, I've been looking around, and a barn wedding could be rustic and charming. So, if you can live without your barn for a few weeks while we decorate, I think we can make it really pretty. What do you think, daddy? I could probably work around the barn a little bit. - That is cute. - I don't think - I'm going for cute. - Well, what are you going for? - What do you like? - That's pretty. - You look pretty. - Gorgeous. - Congratulations. - I don't know, they're all starting to look alike to me. Ugh, okay, now all day you have been acting like somebody stole your puppy, what's going on? I don't know, all this rushing, the wedding stuff, and... and I still haven't found that ring. Just, you know, what if it's a sign? Oh, it's not a sign. It's only a sign if you make it a sign. Now, it's an unfortunate thing that happened, but it doesn't prove your love. I don't know, Henry's just so calm about everything. It's like he doesn't even care about the ring. Henry has been wanting to marry you since 8th grade. He's on cloud nine. Now, losing a ring's not gonna bring him down. Yeah, all right. Hey, I think I know what dress you're gonna wear. - Which one? - I can't believe - we didn't think of it before. - Mom's wedding dress. I don't know, do ya think? - It'll be perfect. - You think? Let's go get it. Vintage is in. Is it? - Okay, let's go. - Center table right here. I hope you're coming to tap's auction. Oh, I can't afford much of anything with this wedding coming up, Jeff. Yeah, that's too bad. It's a lot of livestock. Thought it was just a few things. No, he's selling it all. That's no good. Well, it's real. Hey, Lynnie, it is mom again. Just a little worried. I hope everything is okay. I love you, call me please, when you... Guess what I just heard. Tap Peterson's liquidating his whole ranch, every animal. Well, that's troubling. Last person I thought would have money troubles. Something's wrong here, we can't let him go under. Affects too many people. Do what you gotta do to buy it all. - We can't afford that, dad. - We're the only ones - who can get close. - And that puts US at risk. - You know that. - Greater risk if we don't, honey. I'll find out what's going on. You get down to that auction, buy it all. Oh, and we're having a family dinner tonight 7:30. I'm making a big announcement, so wear something pretty, and tell your boyfriend to come too. Fiancé, that's my fiancé now. That's the one. Sorry I'm late. - Lunch. - Thank you. And this is compliments of Claudia... Says you have to pick out your tuxes. Well, I was thinking a nice suit would do. But tuxes might be nice. Well, whatever you wanna wear. Um, hey, you know, listen, turns out that things are a little bit more serious with tap than we thought, he's selling off all of his livestock, and daddy wants me to buy it all. Well, I have some savings. My money's yours if you need it. No, no, I couldn't ask that of you. We'll, uh... we'll figure it out. Anyway, daddy wants you to come for a dinner tonight. Oh, sorry, I can't tonight. Oh, well, okay. Hm... love you. Thank you. Well, you know that picture we took yesterday? - When the horse came in... - Yeah. Your horse came in, wanted to be in the picture. Came out great. - This horse... - So, do you know what this big announcement is that dad's making? No, beats me. Do you think it's about him and Claudia? Couldn't stand to be alone, the horse. - The horse loves ya. - No. Not dad's style. Dad's style's like a brick over the head. - You didn't hear that. - Okay, okay. I brought US all together, very special reason. Everybody deserves a second chance. And that's what this is all about now, second chance. Watch me, watch me, boys. That's a ring box. Wow, are you... you sure about this? I mean, Claudia's a lovely woman but... but, I mean, how many days have you known each other? No, this is not about US, it's not about me. This is about someone else. Thank you, John. Beccs, I wanted a second chance to make this right and ask you properly. The ring is temporary, till you find the other one. Beccs, we have known each other our lives. - Yes, we have. - Hey everybody, - I have a surprise. - Lynnie, Brady. Come on in, you're just in time. I found my dad. Hey, everybody. Hi, Rebecca. Caleb. Caleb, would you step in the other room? Just for a little bit. Henry's just about to say something important. No, he can stay. Lynnie found her dad. Y'all should celebrate. Welcome home, Caleb. Excuse me. Henry. Henry. - There you are. - Barn's looking nice. - Yeah. - Claudia works fast. She does, I just hope it's big enough. You did invite the whole town. Maybe I got a little overzealous. Hm. I like it, I do. It's a very sweet gesture. You sure you want to do this? Of course I want to do this. Why would you ask that? I don't know. Caleb's back. I reckon that's gotta mess with your head. I don't blame you if you need more time. Henry whitlock, I know that you love me. And we are gonna get married in this barn, we're gonna have a big, beautiful wedding with the whole town and I could not be happier. - Okay. - Okay. All right. What do you think is happening in that house right now? I imagine right now my family's giving Caleb the third-degree. You should get back in there. This involves you too. Come with me, it involves you too. Nah. I'm gonna duck out for the night. Good luck. Henry whitlock wearing the badge now. Henry? I mean, you ran a pretty tight ship. But, uh, well, Henry seems like he'd let folks do whatever they want. He has always been sort of a pushover, right? Henry's a fine sheriff. That's good. That's good, people change. Do they, Caleb? I'd like to think so. Well, where you been all these years? Thank you. Uh, well, you know. I mean here and there, it's sort of... Well, it's actually a long story. But a while back, I settled down and I've been making a good life for myself. What are your intensions, Caleb? Yes, Caleb, what exactly are your intensions? Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, my family can be a little overprotective of me. It's okay. Just remember, I found him. I convinced him to come with US. So let's not scare him off just yet. It's been a long day and I'm sure he's tired. That's right, Lynnie, it has been a long day. We all need to give it a rest for the night. Brady, take Mr. Peterson home. You know what, actually, I'd rather not have my father know I'm home yet, if that's all right. I told him he could stay here. At the b&b. Lynnie, that is not a good idea. Why? Mom? I don't care. Give you a little extra blanket here. Make yourself right at home but I gotta be honest, I don't think you being here is a good thing. Yeah, I got that impression from your whole family. Look, Caleb, you were always nice to me but when you disappeared it was more than my sister you hurt. We all had to pick up the pieces. Understood, this has been a lot for all of US to take in. Well, the only way you're gonna gain my daddy's trust is through actions, not words. - So make an effort. - Will do. Thank you for the advice. I'm sorry, momma. I just didn't want you to talk me out of it. So you decide to bring him back here without so much as a little heads up, huh? I just want to get to know him, mom. I know what you want, Lynnie, but you know what, it's not always about you. Did you ever stop to think for one second how it might affect the rest of US? Poor Henry's in the middle of proposing again, you didn't care, did you? I'm sorry, I didn't know. Caleb could've come back. He knew exactly where I was. But he didn't, did he? I was here raising you. Do you know how long I waited for him to walk through that door? Or how I jumped every time the phone rang and I was hoping it would be him. I'm glad you found him, honey, I'm so glad, I really am, you got what you wanted. But do not think for one second that the rest of US are going to share in your same enthusiasm. Excuse me. Come on now, come on! We just bought all of tap Peterson's livestock, you know. - Yeah. - Something just doesn't - seem right. - No 'cause a ranching community is like its own ecosystem. One piece of the food chain disappears and it affects everyone. Yeah, his name is Caleb Peterson. This is just a hunch, you know. Let me know if you find anything, okay? Good. Think I'm being silly? - Hey. - I've been looking all over for you, we got the chandeliers up and they look great. Chandeliers, hm. Are you okay? Look, I think you're a wonderful woman. You're smart, you're beautiful. You're fun. But? But, um, it sort of would've been my 50th anniversary with my late wife. And eight years since I lost her and it seems like eight days. It's hard to move on. Yeah, it's hard. I completely understand. Friends? Friends is good. So how long are you gonna keep ignoring me? Well, I figure I owe ya. It's been how many years now? - Touché. - Mm. You know, I haven't even been on a horse since I left here. - Isn't that crazy? - It is crazy 'cause you were a natural rider. Thank you, but never as good as you though. Good to know that time has given you a little bit of perspective on things. Time tends to give one perspective on a lot of things. It does, doesn't it? Yeah. Ride with me, please? I've been wanting to talk to you ever since I got back. You do remember how to saddle a horse, don't ya? Good girl. - I thought you wanted to talk? - I'm just enjoying the moment. How are you and Lynnie gettin' along? Really good. You know what, she's an amazing girl. She's not a girl anymore, she's a woman. Hey, Becca, you did a great job raising her. Yeah, I did the best I could. Made my mistakes along the way. If I had a pebble for every mistake I've made, I'd have a whole mountain range. You still talk like a cowboy, don't ya? Hey. Wow. Wow. Did you think I forgot? We were just kids, weren't we? It was real though, wasn't it. It was on my end. 'M not so sure about yours. I've never had that feeling again. I miss those days. Hm. I heard you've done quite well for yourself. Grown up quite nicely, Caleb Peterson. - Is that right? - Oh, don't go getting a big head and all. You know, I thought about what it would be like to see you after all these years. You know, Becca, you're just as beautiful now as you were back then. You're still slick, aren't you? What exactly did you expect coming back here? I don't know, being back here and seeing you, and meeting Lynnie and I mean, it does make me wonder. No, you don't get to saunter back in here and wonder. You lost that privilege. Well, hey, this is a nice surprise. What's wrong? I saw you with Caleb. Uh, yeah, he wanted to talk so we went for a ride. - Is that okay? - Of course it's okay. You got a lot to talk about. Huh, yeah, well. You know, he's matured a little bit. But deep down, still the same old Caleb. Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. You liked the old Caleb. The old me liked the old Caleb. Still. Maybe it's best we press pause for a bit. Let you figure everything out. Press pause? Henry, I know it's a little bit crazy around here - but has nothing to do with US. - Has everything to do with US. - No. - We can't pretend otherwise. - Well, what are you saying? - I'm saying we need to give you - some time to think. - I don't need time to think. Maybe I do. I love you, Rebecca. But I don't want to be the consolation prize. The wedding is postponed for now. By the way, there's something I gotta tell you. - The... the wedding's off. - What... what happened? Henry feels like he needs a little time and thinks that I don't want this, yup. Well, what do you want, mom? I want to marry Henry whitlock. If there's one thing that Caleb being here has shown me it's that I, uh, is that I really do love... I really do love Henry. So what are you waiting for? You always taught me a woman can do anything a man can do. So go and get him, mom. Oh, you do listen! - Go do some chores, young lady. - Okay, I will. Well, we hate to see you go. - Travel safe. - Thank you. Please don't go, Ms. Claudia. Aw, little buddy. You take good care of these folks, okay? - Sure you have to go? - If there's no wedding I'm not really needed here. Things could change. Cold feet get warm real fast. You're a good man, John. I wish you all the best here. Dad, you've accomplished so much. I never thought I would be here for this long but here I am. Ah, you're young. You wanna pursue your dreams you should. You know? Don't you let anything stand in your way. I know but sometimes what we thought we wanted can change. Like my mom and Henry. The wedding was on and now it's off. Your mom called off the wedding? No, it was Henry. Ah. Lynnie. I'm not sure how much longer I should stick around here. I feel like me being here is just opening up a bunch of old wounds. No, no, not for me. It's actually... It's quite the opposite. I don't want you to leave. This is a little slice of heaven, isn't it? Yeah, it is. Um, here you go. This is considerably short. Right, well, that's about all I could get for right now. I really would need a little extension. You had time. The terms of our agreement will go into effect at the end of business in two days. - Hey, Henry. - Caleb. How can I help you? I heard you called off the wedding. Yeah, just didn't seem quite right. Well, I wanted to come by, Henry, and I wanted to apologize to you if my showing up had anything to do with that decision. She couldn't do any better for herself than marrying you. And I can tell that she really loves you... That you guys are right for each other. I appreciate you coming over here, Caleb. I admit, seeing you back here brings out all kinds of insecurities I haven't felt in years. But this is about Rebecca. What she wants. I made the call, but it's really her choice now. We're not kids anymore. Ain't that the truth. And you know what, you know what, I never thought that you could stay in this town and be happy. But I look at you, Henry, and I see a man with a good life. - Yeah, I do. - I respect that. Thanks for coming by. And you're sure it was Cory price? Okay, thank you, Billy. I appreciate it. Hey, partner. Come for your mints? Here. Uh, actually, can I ask you a question, grandpa? Of course, anytime. Uh, how do you know when you love a girl? Oh, that's a big one, that's a big one. You got some little girl that you got your eye on? Yeah, her name's Brooke. Well, how do you feel when you're around Brooke? Feels really weird, like I just ate a big bowl of spaghetti. Oh, and do you feel that way around any of your other friends? Hm, could be serious. That spaghetti feeling's hard to find. So what do you think I should do? Well, the best thing always is to be honest, right. So be nice, be respectful. And just tell her how you feel and if she don't respond then at least you gave it your best shot, right. - Okay, thanks, grandpa. - Okay, kiddo. Hey, you dropped your mint. I found it, grandpa, I found the ring! - Hey! - I have to go and tell - aunt Rebecca! - Yeah, yeah, go, go! - John, Rebecca. - How you doing, Tony? I hope you guys are enjoying the food. You bet. What ever happened to those cops that came out to your place? Tap and I heard it on the scanner. Said he was going to help you. - Why would he do that? - I don't know. It was just a mix-up out there. Well, I got some fresh peach cobbler in the back - when you guys are ready. - Sounds good. - We'll do that. - Enjoy. Thanks, Tony. Maybe he really was trying to help. Maybe he was. My family means everything to me. I hope you know that. I do. So then you understand that I need to trust the people in our lives. Now you come back here, shaking things up. You know, playing with emotions. If this is about the wedding, I didn't have anything to do with that. It's not about the wedding. I made some calls. You gotta be honest about who you are, son. You want to remain around here, my suggestion is you get straight with your daughter. I know I owe them a lot of money. You tell them I'm gonna pay them back, all right, in full, I don't know how and I don't know when but I'm gonna do it, no matter what it... Relax, your entire debt's been paid. What do you mean the entire debt's been paid? You have your father to thank. My father paid the entire debt in full? Yup, he did. We're good, anything else? - No, no. - Thank you. Thank you. Hello, dad. Son. Manny, take my horse. - I love you, dad. - I love you too, son. Hey, come on. Let's just go inside and have a drink, what do you say? All right. Glad you're home, son. - Come on in. - Thank you guys for agreeing to meet with me. Um. Becca. So, Lynnie. Mr. Landsburg has been kind enough to help me to understand that if you and I are gonna have a fresh start then I need to come clean with you - about a few things. - Like what? So I've done some things in my life that I'm not proud of and I found myself in a hole of debt that I couldn't get out of. So I did what I do best and I skipped town. Now since then, I have been living an honest, quiet life. But I've been looking over my shoulder all the time because I knew, eventually, it'd catch up with me and find me. And well, they caught up with me and they found me. Well, thank you, thank you, Caleb, for coming clean. That's something your father could never do. You know, my father is not as bad a guy as you think he is. You know, he paid that debt for me. Yeah, now it's come clear. And to do so, he had to borrow a huge sum of money from a private lender in the city. Let me guess, couldn't pay his lenders. He gave them what he could from the auction and he gave them everything else he had but come tomorrow, if he doesn't pay the entire thing then they're gonna own that ranch. He put it all on the line for me. Everything, everything he's worked his whole entire life for. This whole thing is my fault. Isn't that what you always say, grandpa? Family first, ranch second. Isn't that what you say? Isn't that exactly what tap is doing for his son? Yes, it is. Can we help him, grandpa? What's the name of that lender? Tap Peterson is our family so how much are we talking? His outstanding debt is $450,000. Are you kidding me? That is a lot of money, dad, are you sure we can do this? We're honest people. We work hard to put food on your table. - We're trustworthy, see? - I'm sure you are. But the terms of his loan are clear. He has until 5 pm tomorrow to pay in full or the loan defaults and his property is ours. But that's not fair. His land is worth way more than that. What are you people doing here? - Dad. - This is my affair, not yours. - Easy, easy, big fella. - Dad, I told him why you need the money, that it's my fault. Your fault? It's nothing to do with it. It's my business and if I want to burn it down, son, I will. Rebecca, put the word out. Tell the town folks to meet US at the barn at 3. Okay, what are you thinking, dad? I'd like you there, tap. There's always a way. Got a little time still. How much do we still need? Well, with the co-op money, we still need $150k. - Where is everyone? - They'll be here. There we go. See. I knew you'd be the first to show, I knew it. Good to see ya. Oh, there she is, I'm glad you showed up 'cause I know you've got piles of money. Great to see yas. Good to see ya, very kind of you to be here. Everybody knows what we're here for. Thanks, thanks for coming, good to see ya. That's a goodly group. Listen, we all know why we're here. I know tap Peterson better than most. I know that he can be a pain in the rear. And he feels the same way abut me. But, you know, his ranch is in jeopardy and he's too proud to ask for help. So I'll just be the one to ask. You know, the Peterson family started this community, really. You know, we all benefited from it and I know it could be you needing help, could be me needing help. And I know if that ever happens, I know that tap Peterson would be there for ya. So I'm releasing the emergency co-op funds to him. Anyone have any objection to that you could speak up right now. Good for you. Now listen, daddy asked me to buy up all of tap's livestock. Now we didn't do it for US. We're not keeping that livestock. We did it for tap, we did it for all of US. We did it for the community. So that no one could come in here and buy it up and split US all up, but even with that money also that's there and the co-op money - was just not gonna be enough. - Now y'all are the most generous, and the kindest people we know. So if you could just look into your hearts, do a little soul searching, give what you can. - It would be mighty kind of you. - I know we can make this thing work. We can get over the top here. See that, oh, look. It's not much, but it's all we've got. I hope it helps. - Whoa. - What! That was going towards a new bale splitter but we can make do with an old one. Come here, you. Come on, people, tap Peterson helped out everybody in this barn in one way or another. Nice speech. Hey, what you doing here? - Rebecca called me. - Oh, so glad to see ya. Excuse me. She's waiting at the bank. She's closing soon, how much we got? How much we got? It's not enough, daddy. - Nowhere near enough. - How much? - We need $66k. - Oh, boy. Sorry I'm late. - Did you make it? - No, we're still short. How much you need? $66k. Okay. Although I guess this means we aren't going to the Maldives. Henry. I told you, I have some savings. I've been a bachelor for 25 years. Henry, are you sure about this? Caleb, this is for you. Consider that a thank you gift. If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have our wonderful Lynnie right here. - Thank you. - Thank you, Henry. - I'm gonna give him a hug. - Thank you. I just want to say, thank you, thank you all. At least, that's all I got to say. Thank you very much. Henry whitlock. We have known each other our whole lives. And you have never once let me down. You never cease to amaze me with your kindness, your Patience for me, and your love. You know you have broken down these walls that I have put up around my heart all his time. You're my best friend. And I am in love with you. So I'm asking you humbly here on my knee, if you will marry me. Yes, of course I will. - I love you. - I love you too. The wedding is still on! Hey, time to get dressed, cowboy. Okay, boss. You take care of my girl now. Forever, I promise. So what are your plans now? Well, I think I'm gonna stick around and help my dad out with our ranch. But most importantly, I'm gonna catch up on a lot of lost moments with my lovely daughter. I like that plan. I love you, daddy. - Grandpa, here she is. - Hey, kiddo. Do you feel spaghetti in your gut? Yeah, I got spaghetti. That feeling's hard to find. You bet, you bet it is. Hey. Look at you. Well, look who's here. I just come by to say... Well, I guess say thank you. Let you know that I promise you I'll give you back every penny. And the nice people in there too, of course. I know you will, tap. I know you will. Listen, you could've come in, you know. You can come in right now. Well, I'd kind of like to but I just figured... Well, today's your day and you go on and enjoy it. I brought something for Becca and Henry, a little gift if you don't mind. Hey, Manny! Wow, tap, this is serious. It's a fine horse, that's your champion reining horse, - isn't it? - Yes, sir. That's some horse. That's from the heart. It's a fine gift, tap. So does this mean we're friends? Every hero needs his Nemesis. Oh, oh! - Which are you? - The hero, of course. I'll take it... I'll take it from here. Come on you, come on, you good-looking.
