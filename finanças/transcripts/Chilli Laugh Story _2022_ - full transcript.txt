When I was 5, Mom and I visited her hometown, Chiuchow The elders insisted on having a hotpot party despite the hot weather All foodies say Chiuchow hotpot is all about Shacha sauce But I saw no Shacha sauce there All I could find was this chilli sauce They said as a Chiuchow boy, I had to try this sauce So I did and it burnt like hell on its way in... burnt even more on its way out Despite my diarrhea episodes... Granduncle insisted that I'd get used to that sauce eventually That's why he always brought us 2 jars whenever he visited HK this chilli sauce has always been an inseparable part of my life From that moment on... our fridge has always been stocked with this chilli sauce Until recently, I was confident our music festival could be run in a way due to the recently tightened rules regulations on running large scale outdoor events in Hong Kong Coba, please prepare the cancellation announcement by today. As I'm saying... I was thinking that... I was thinking that, maybe we could... call you hear me? What's going on over there, Man? Can someone get the door? Someone's at the door Answer the freaking door! Sir, why aren't you wearing a mask? Because I'm at home Wanna unmask to catch your breath? You've got a parcel Your address: 1st floor, 12 Hung Shui Kiu Main Street, correct? Yes Are you Mr. Alan Cheung? Funny You've got the name right and the address right But I haven't bought anything I don't shop online; how do I get a parcel? Sign the form first? What's in it? Sign and see for yourself I can't sign before I know what's inside You'll find out later I'll sign after I find out Sign, then find out If you don't want it, our company will return the parcel Wait... get this straight Get this straight, I'm not one of those BS clients I only demanded to know what's inside... Get this straight, I'm not one of those BS clients You, however... are clueless about what you're delivering That makes you an BS deliveryman I should file a complaint And... I don't shop online; how do I get a parcel? Uncle, are you homebound and lonely? I have an idea You can call the office and ask them You can sign for it now and find out yourself Come on, it'd only take you one phone call It'd only take you one signature I can lend you my phone if you wish I can lend you my pen I have to know what it is before signing for it I know what What don't you just call your office? Everyone has a hard time working from home Who doesn't have an annoying dad thanks to the pandemic? I'm not so sure If anything, the pandemic has made my dad... better When I was little, he was truly annoying Kid, where do you study? I study at D... DBS! My son got into DBS! He's a DBS boy! Congratulations! What an achievement! Indeed... it's so hard to get into this prestigious school Sun Yat-sen was his fellow alumni Stop it Let's give him a big hand Come on... Come on... Way to go, son My dad is surely annoying But my mom is actually harder to deal with Because what she's concerned about... is way more upsetting than my father's issues What are you mom's concerns? She's only had one concern through the years Thanks I hate this flat, it got us into... negative equity from day one besides the high interest Maybe we aren't meant to own a flat I must buy another flat I hate to live under a stranger's roof, paying off someone else's mortgage Daddy Yes? Don't get chatty with that man this time He did all the talking every time I was always quiet Mr. Cheung, Mrs. Cheung! Hi! This area is quiet and peaceful Very liveable My clients who moved here usually stay for good One even got all of his relatives to relocate to this area What a big happy family Say Mr. Cheng, do you drive? No No worries The minibuses are only a 12-min walk away They run from 8am to 8pm, so no worries Mom, you have a moment? What is it? You don't like it? You know what I do for living Live shows don't even get started at 8pm Honestly, I have no idea what it is that you do You don't even go to office now All the shows got cancelled If you get sacked, we'll be doomed You'll have no proof of income... to get a first-time homebuyer loan for us Why must you buy a flat? That's not the point, I just... I don't want to live under a stranger's roof... paying off someone else's mortgage How is renting a home considered living under a stranger's roof? You pay for it but it's not yours Mommy... When you can't pay, you have to move Mommy, when we bought the Whampoa flat... was the commission rate 1%? I don't remember Mr. Lee said it has always been 2% for him No point in arguing since I've never bought a village home But I remember it has always been 1% for housing sales I have no idea; it may be different for village homes Mr. Lee knows best Yes and I've been a village home agent for nearly 20 years But I can't speak for city properties Never dealt with any We bought the Whampao Garden flat in 1997... for $5.12M, at $7,390 per sq. ft. I still remember our agent at the time was named Chan He also lived in Whampao He even cut his commission to 50 grand I remember we sold the flat in 2006 The price was... $4,253 per sq. ft. Mr. Chan said since we were selling a hurry... he had to charge us the commission of 29 grand in full Nowadays the price is way above $14,000 per sq. ft. Yes, I remember it all; how often do I get to buy a pad? Then again, I have no experience in village properties. Are you done? I'm done What's your point? It just happened that Mr. Lee and I were... discussing the commission rate How many times has it been? Must you tell everything to everyone? What's wrong with discussing his rate? I'm trying to help save a buck so that you can buy a flat Let's go back to your business Given the current situation... why are you so determined to start a chilli sauce brand? I aspired to be an entrepreneur on my last day of school How you fared? I'm okay, I guess? Hmm And you? Let me see It's nothing special You did... awesome Yes And you? Don't have it Don't bother, what's there to see It's just numbers Look far ahead No one said Sun Yat-sen did well in school, right? He never took the DSE exams... so you outdid him Hmm Uncle, your observation is surely unique And very inspiring Many famous people did poorly in school But they ended up being worshiped by millions For example: Newton Beethoven Beckham Alan Tam Uncle, what about Yip Kai-foon? (Hong Kong infamous criminal) And Cheung Tze-keung? (Hong Kong infamous criminal) And Kwai Ping-hung! (Hong Kong infamous criminal) The point is, everyone needs to be good at something Agree Definitely A scientific study says... people who did well in school... usually became professionals 82% of those... who did poorly in school become their bosses That's me Fat chance! You, my boss? Beware I heard it on the radio too What kind of boss do you want to be? A successful one How do you define a successful boss? Someone with a vision and conviction... someone who pursues his passions in his own way Just you wait... Just you wait, I will succeed! The school will close next week Let's book a public football pitch You do it I'm a basketballer Sorry I asked I'll do it Good But all bookings... that you made in the past 2 years... got cancelled in the end His specialty is organizing "big concerts" He can't book a mere football pitch It's "music festivals" Even so, they got cancelled Be honest, ever considered getting a real job? Be a professional like the two of us Professional my foot, you trust-fund kids Hey! We've known each other for years Is this how you see us? You think living off my family and... not working is fun? Do you know what heavy price we paid... to remain trust-fund kids? As a straight A student in DSE... I still live under my father's wing! You think that is an easy path? You won't understand people like us The moment you were born... you were entitled to pursue your dream... to vow to become a boss one day The moment we were born we were already bosses You think it's easy to live as CEOs? I can't talk to anyone about this, can I? It's okay Are you done? Have you no empathy? Try my dad's eggs Then try my mom's bread too Plus her extra-large loaf What's wrong with your folks? They're stuck at home Pandemic chefs, mamakase, never heard of it? You? I only have my mom's chilli sauce Sweet Wow, you mom's sauce... smells so good! Try it Go for it On tea-stained eggs? Have some bread, bon appétit Your dad's egg is rather... smooth and fragile Your mom's bread is double E Is that so? A greeting form minced garlic, followed by... a bombardment of chilli heat on the taste buds Chilli and garlic maybe the only ingredients... but their transition over time is the most spectacular... suffice to... provoke an alchemy between the traditional and the modern... exploding the taste buds That pungency... defies time and distance for it will always... linger in the deepest corner of my heart Don't overkill man! Let me try Heritage? Alchemy? It really tastes good I usually don't find this sauce this great Oh, my God, whoa... whoa My mom's sauce is crazy good! It's chili! Yummy, yummy chilies It's garlic! That lovely smell... OMG, a chilli shower! They're huge! What are you filming? I posted it on Story last night Got me many enquires What did you post? Don't post on the internet, it's dangerous I'm showing my friends that I have half a jar left They'll need to split it among themselves Who treats people to half a jar of sauce? So petty Want me to make a few jars for your friends? Are you two helping at all? I'm handling the influx of enquiries about the sauce Stop replying We aren't making money out of this (My friends are sharing the pics; how can I buy it?) (May I order 15 jars?) (It surely is spicy HOT judging from the look of it) (Your mom is a much better cook than mine) (Lucky you, your mom's sauce is crazy good) (Awesome! I didn't know your mom makes chilli sauce) (Awesome! I didn't know your mom makes chilli sauce) (Sell it online!) (I'm willing to pay $100 per jar) (Seriously, are you selling it?) (I've got the dumplings; am waiting for your sauce) (I can't tolerate spicy food, but I'll try your sauce) (I've called all of my friends who love spicy to support it) (The boss will deliver the sauce by himself?) (I want Coba's chilli sauce so much, I love spicy) (It seems so spicy) (Any levels of the spicy? I usually take mild) What if we sell it? How much can we make? So far, each of my chilli sauce stories... has over 6,000 views -that's 6 times my usual traffic I normally get 1,000 views at most What does that mean? People are sharing my stories What are you saying? Exactly... Come sit down I'm saying, we've just found a new market niche Due to the pandemic, no one gets to dine out anymore You either order takeout or cook your own dinner But honestly... how many home cooks out there are... master chefs like Mom? Let's make 100 jars for starters 100 jars? Forget it, you can't make peanuts How about 200? How do you sell them? Online, of course It's the simplest way So whether you're a clerk or a salesperson... a lifeguard or a librarian... or a cloud engineer or architect or consultant... you can buy our sauce online, on the run... as long as you're not short on funds Are you done? Why would a stranger buy your chilli sauce? It's nothing special... takes only 2 ingredients to make And that's easy? How hard can it be? It's quite difficult Listen to her I wasn't asking a rhetorical question I repeat: it's quite difficult But in what way? Look... It's something you can do during lockdown at home You may even quit your day job Don't be naïve, you can't quit your job Who's naïve? I'm serious I'm not taking a cut of the profits They are all yours How generous of you! How much are you selling it for? What do you care? Who says you have a part in this? I never said I want in You heard him No need to split the proceeds with him It's not like you can strike it rich by fiddling with chillies If anyone can make good chilli sauce... everyone will be doing it What makes you think that you've got a winner here? I don't know shit about making chilli sauce Of course, I'll leave that all up to Mom Every day she goes to the wet market to... cherry-pick the best chillies and garlic... before hand-dicing all ingredients at home She insists that hand-diced chillies taste the best I, on the other hand, focus on... Excuse me, may I try this? Packaging design How? Mom doesn't compromise when it comes to ingredients I'll also stand my ground when it comes to packaging How many do you have? I'll take them all Ladies and gentlemen... the Chiu Chiu Chiu chilli sauce... is offcially in business With several quarantine centres operating in Hong Kong... our source informed us of the multiple complaints... against the meal arrangements... for the persons in quarantine at Chun Yueng Estate Mom, Dad Aunt Wendy just texted me She's at Chun Yeung Estate! Want me to call her She's not picking up (Sis, Connecting...) Oops, a black lady Sorry! Wrong Number! Alan! I'm using a face mask It's Wendy alright... Sis, you even survived the cruise ship fiasco How did you end up in Chung Yueng Estate? It's my fate I was even in a hot pot party for 1,000 people No harm came to me until a friend and I volunteered... for a beach cleanup and outing at Shek O It was for environmental cause I couldn't turn it down Sure... Then one of the volunteers got infected You can't fight fate You can't fight fate but you can try avoiding it How could I? I only had four walls at home for company I'd rather have a staycation here Staycation? Aunt Wendy, it's not even close! What do you and your date do in a hotel?

Oh, no... you're at high risk You don't know who you'll be serving on board Many flight attendants got infected already Then I should stay in Hong Kong Be a "foot soldier" and deliver food? You're taking it too far You too may become a "foot soldier" You company called off all their shows They'll soon let you go Whatever will be will be Then will be a foot soldier If I were a foot soldier, you'll be a jockey But I don't know how to ride a horse Jockey don't not necessarily need to ride horses No I don't You really don't?

You are senile Didn't we do it in the kitchen before? Just admit that you're senile Then who was that? Molly Yau (pun of "makes no sense in Cantonses") Who's Molly Yau? You said you only did it in the kitchen with me Molly Yau (pun of "makes no sense") Who's Molly Yau? Answer me, who is Molly Yau? Go to sleep Do I know her?

This hand get just like that Yes Does it feel good? Yes. Give me all the extra-large ones Sure You were gone for 1 hour 22 minutes Why are you wearing gloves? There were people everywhere at the town centre They could be spreading germs, for all I know Naturally, I was being careful not to bring any germs home Since I already bought the gloves... I might as well give myself extra protection... while trying out the gloves Once I put them on... I was shocked by... how thin gloves can be made these days and how durable they are New techs are truly amazing I can't bring myself to remove them How much do I owe you? It's peanuts, don't bother (Your PAY MEME Friends) (RITA CHAN sent YOU $100 re: gloves today) (COBA C sent RITA CHAN $4,280 re: 35 jars of chilli sauce yesterday) (COBA C sent RITA CHAN $3,600 re: CHIU CHIU CHIU 3 days ago) (COBA C sent RITA CHAN $4,900 re: 40 jars of chilli sauce 4 days ago) Whoa... they're making so much money This thing sucks $3,800... $5,000...

We're screwed! Are we going to get arrested? I told you, this is illegal! Even if this is illegal... we are legally illegal What the hell is legally illegal? This illegality hurts no one This is an act of righteousness What are you saying? It is the law that wrongly makes us illegal so we are not illegal So no one needs a food license Yep! Having a license doesn't make your food cleaner What if a customer gets diarrhea? C'mon, it's only natural to poop after you eat If our chilli sauce gives people constipation... then we're in trouble It's not that easy to get caught Relax You can't be timid when running a big business Sis, you'll understand It's not like we're making big bucks, that's why... I want to keep some goods here... to pretend that the sauce is made in this kitchen No need to keep a stash here It's merely chilli, garlic and oil I had the same thought As you know, uncle's chilli sauce... only has those 3 ingredients If anything... your diner will always have those 3 things ready It's okay, we're family! Here Which table are these for? Just find yourself a seat and enjoy Despite rising hopes... for a relaxation of the evening dine-in ban after health specialists... expressed their strong opposition against the proposition the government made the decision... to extend the current dine-in ban alongside... the cap of 2 per dining group and the face mask rules... for another 7 days until the end of August 25 Now that everyone eats at home... our chilli sauces will keep flying off the shelves! Sorry Coba, I have to terminate your contract immediately Today is your last day, Coba Hong Kong has entered a 4th wave of the pandemic With another 62 new cases added, the dancing cluster... has ballooned to 479 people...

That's absurd an entrepreneur, to be exact Do not fear the tempest swallowing our passion for no distance can keep our love apart I've been thinking Now that my online business is on track I should try something new Trying new things when I'm away, huh? I want to try working with small shops And my first pick is... The original HK-dog! Baby, you're so smart You're the best Despite the turbulent waters and the hollowing strong winds like clouds, my feelings will find you Mr. Lee Are the triplexes that you showed us still available? 3rd floor plus rooftop?

I need to unclog my ear of wax Let me check the sweet soup first Then Coba, you get to watch it first I'd love to hear the opinion of a music professional My pleasure, Aunt Wendy Send it to me If I could send it... I wouldn't have travelled all the way here from Ap Lei Chau Just ask Bon to help Your cousin is very busy I hardly get to see him It takes longer to ask him than coming here myself Then come more often to help out I wouldn't be here if I could go dancing with my friends You won't be permitted to dance for some time Huh? Do I need a permit to dance? Yes? Where do I get this permit? Auntie... you got me Ain't I good? Very good Someone told that joke on a bus I laughed till my bladder leaked What I want is to... reinvent classic street foods, give them a new image... and attract new clienteles Good thinking Young people should try everything I often tell my young employees... You've got to try everything I wish all bosses are open-minded like you I've tried many different types of food My conclusion is that... your hotdog is the perfect match... for my chilli sauce That's why I sincerely want to collaborate with you... to launch a new Hot Chilli Dog We've been in business here for over 30 years... and only made one kind of hotdog All my regulars are used to that taste The new dog can bring in new young customers The youngsters these days only care for... street foods from Japan, Korea and even Taiwan People of your age don't eat HK hotdogs But if we collaborate... I can introduce my young customers to your shop here Then street food legacies ike yours can live on No, we can't change anything We'll be in trouble if we do You never know till you try, boss I tried many years ago...

C'mon, sis -Coming... Your ice milk-tea Eat up Wow, abalone! I bought it You're the man I heard that your chilli sauce is a success Indeed We get by With both of you working together... I suppose you can sell 100 jars a week? 100 jars... You don't need two people for that I alone can churn out 200 easy... So you're selling 400 jars a week? This is a lot of hard work This is a lot of money! You can't make much money out of it, right? A little bit Very little Sis, they're selling it online for $90 a jar Not cheap at all Your Beef Chow Fun can earn you at most $10 per order Well, we don't know how to sell things online When you're making 200 grand a month... you can hire help We aren't even close to making 200 grand What about the cost? We should set the record straight Chillies alone cost $40 per catty What about garlic and cooking oil? Everything costs money You do the math-we sell 1,200 jars a month That gives us some 40 grand each Nowhere near 200 grand! 40 grand... is way better than what we're making, Sis Why aren't we profiting from our family recipe... but an oursider is? What outsider? We're all family here! Family? Am I included? They left us out! I did offer to partner with Big Sister What about me, your brother? Sis, if you don't want in, I want in; it's easy money! What makes you think it's easy? Your sauce is in name made here in our kitchen You have it easy Enough! I volunteered to lend them my kitchen's name free of charge Why put money above our family? Perhaps I should settle a score with you first? How much is this and that? How about a moment of peace? How often do we get to eat together? The dine-in cap may return to 2 persons tomorrow... for all I know! I'm home There're letters on your desk Read them, don't just leave them there What letters? I've switched to e-statements What's wrong this time? I didn't do wrong; I stepped on a land mine Just let it go Tell it to the person who planted the mine He should have kept this mouth shut I was trying to help Guess how helpful he was tonight I told him "not" to discuss money at dinner The next thing I knew... he revealed everything in our account books Now everyone knows how much we're making She thinks that all I talked about was money Money makes him happy Does money make her... cry instead? Then let me do all the work and make all the money Tell him to do just that and be happy! I quit! You heard her He'll be the death of our chilli sauce Is there such a thing as a living chilli sauce? Ever seen a walking one? Lunatics From this day on, I'll make the chilli sauce Sis It's me, sis What's up, bro? I've got a big deal to discuss with you C'mon out now Did I miss it again?

I'm Daisy Sorry, I'm late No problem We're all excited about working with you As soon as Arnold knew that you said yes... he got us all into the war room I see In the last few years, Arnold has been scouting... promising local brands for global roll-outs Your chilli sauce is... the first HK brand that he wants to collaborate with Under the contract, you're to deliver 10,000... units in the 1 year But that's only the beginning of... our evergrowing partnership Our goal is to get more people to know... and taste your chilli sauce Coba? This way Right Every puzzle has one last piece Without that last piece, the puzzle remains incomplete I've been looking for the last piece... for the puzzle of my life for quite some time Coba Hi, Arnold Thank you so much for inviting us I know what you are thinking What does a person like me who has it all... want to do with working with a person like you? Well, I'll give you a quick lesson in economics "Supply and Demand" You have a product that you believe in, Coba And the fundamental in accessing... the astronomical benefits tied to that potential... is tethered to marketing and branding... and increasing the supply... of a branded product that is in demand You increase the supply, Coba... and the demand will follow Close your eyes, just imagine that- the astronomical growth... the beauty of it, Coba You can do it Yes... Feel the power of marketing crossing through your veins It's beautiful Hey Close your eyes Come on! Close your eyes Imagine... It's BEAUTIFUL!!! So? Can you see it? How can I see anything with my eyes closed? You guys have no vision He said you have no vision Because he has all the vision Definitely I don't even have a television or a play station Ouch We ain't One Direction or any or any Michael Jackson All I can think of is... Congratulations Punchline You're the straight-A man Now that you've struck gold... what's your plan? Buy a flat A flat? When we met at 12... you already told people not to buy properties My mom wants to buy a flat This is not the first time we hear it But why now? She put me my name in the mortgage already That's outrageous! Sue your mom! I'll get you a lawyer How about Junius? Stop horsing around We fought over this many times Still, she's my mom Now that I can afford it... I should make it happen Think again You'll spend the rest of your life paying off the mortgage Is it worth it? Yes, according to her We're asking you Well, as long as she thinks so She might be right a few years ago But look at where we are now What's wrong with now? You lost your job! How will you get a mortgage? I just got an order for 10,000 jars of chilli sauce Deliver 10,000 units... then I'll get an order for 20,000 units, followed by 40,000... followed by 100,000 Then who needs a mortgage? I'll pay in full in cash! I'm telling you I'll hit it big this time Okay? Here Hit it big Hit it big You need 10,000 jars? Are you going public? I wish My son received a big order Congratulations! That means you'll give me lots of business Here, take your pick Which is the one we used? That's the one; it's imported The other one is made in China... has the same capacity, weighs way less Their biggest difference is price Yours costs $2 more This is a no-brainer-It's a $2 difference! Place your order quickly I only have a small surplus; better make your decision today Today? But Coba tested many models before deciding on this one If you let him run another test... that will take him days! Look, I only make 50 cents out of that cheaper jar How long does the shipping take? I'm home Just you? Who else? Slow down... I can't keep up You're on schedule; will the first batch be ready tonight? Stop talking and start helping Yes, ma'am, right away The jar is different What is the difference? The shape is completely different It should be slanted "here" but this jar is an outright cube It also weighs a lot less What happened? It looks pretty much the same to me It's a mile apart! Oh yes, this jar is $2 cheaper What is the difference! That was a question We're running a business-This is about branding! Our brand is only a few months old but you changed the packaging? What will the customers think? What's worse, I signed the contract already But you changed the jar without the other party's consent What should I tell them? We didn't know better Would it kill you to ask first? Can't you consult me before making big decisions? What else didn't we consult you? You tell me what this is (Has Been Rejected) Why was it rejected? Aren't you making 35 grand a month? How could you mention nothing about... applying for a mortgage in my name? I'm asking you, why was the application rejected? I was fired I'm not eligible for it without a salary This is serious, why didn't you tell us? Damn! We put down 500 grand What will happen to the flat? Look at you Your son just lost his job What concerns you is not his future... but your property dream Ever since I started working you told me to work hard so that we could buy a flat Did I ever say I want to own a flat? Why can't I buy a flat in my son's name... when I'm paying off the mortgage myself? What's wrong with that? What's your problem? It's not about paying off the loan Once I sign a mortgage... my name is on the line for the next 30 years If you don't have the money, don't buy a flat Coba, that's enough! I've had enough! You guys are never satisfied! Do you know how much your mom sacrifice to own a flat? When we bought the Whampao unit in 1997... she needed the 1st-time homebuyer status... to get the stamp duty exemption Guess what she did? She asked for a divorce! I proposed getting divorced on paper; we could remarry later Why are you telling your son that? You're allowed to talk but I'm not? You're an autocrate! Forget the house, what about the jar? He's done with that Let's talk about the jar You sure? Why not? Each of these jars saves us $2 That's 20 grand for 10,000 jars With that money, we can make another 1,000 jars of sauce Then it's no longer a matter of 20 grand but some 90 grand With that... You two are truly annoying One is pushing a jar on me The other is pushing a mortage on me Have you ever asked me what I want? (Outside Kowloon Tong Station) Mom Why do you come pick me up? Do you need money? Did you fight with your wife? Or little Tonia gave you a hard time? We'll leave for the UK next Monday to enrol Tonia in school Isn't it too soon to send her abroad to study? When you return, you have to undergo a 14-day quarantine Is her school that good? The pandemic will be over soon Can't she go next year? This time around... we won't be coming back You're leaving next week! You're telling me now? After I settle down... I'll bring you over What do I do there? This is my home I can't even get fish ball noodles over there Do you have to go? Once you're there... whatever happens, don't be so hard on yourself You can always come back, okay? Damn it! Hey, Arnold... sorry Let me tell you The highlight of my career has been working... on this chilli sauce Because we both know the chilli sauce that you created and launched online... you had no idea how much unprecedented excitement... you would have created So I've made the decision... to recreate and rebrand your product Let me introduce to you... the one and only irresistible... Chilli La Chilli La? My chilli sauce is called Chiu Chiu Chiu! We just thought that was Chiu Chiu Chiu confusing I'm sorry, I'm getting confused here Why wasn't I included in the discussion beforehand? After all, this is a partnership Come on Coba You made the chilli sauce I sell the chilli sauce So, we came up with the plan We decided that for the next six months, every week we will give away 400 bottles... "free" to the market... "free" to anybody who wants it That's over 10,000 bottles in six months, Coba You're giving them all away for free? Then who will pay real money for my sauce again? How will Chiu Chiu Chiu survive the next 6 months? Coba, read the contract There's no more Chiu Chiu Chiu Just Chilli La So you're saying... you've robbed me of my brand Have I? Kind of 10,000 bottles, Coba Caller: Aunt Wendy Such is the real world of business Either you trick the sucker, or you're the sucker At least you got paid for those 10,000 bottles Your parents will be fine Sure All they care about is money And the money is for whom? That's what parents do The reason I started this chilli sauce business... was to get them off my back... by keeping them busy But after a while... I began to hope that we could do this together indefinitely But it's all over now I failed completely I can live with that But they have to bear the consequences with me Families stick together in bad times That's what makes them families I still remember... the only time... you dad has ever worn a hot pink polo shirt It was the day you got admitted to DBS He said to me: Sis... This is the proudest moment of my life Why did your mom move to Whampoa back then? It was far from her work but very close to your school Don't you know... you're the most loved person in your family? I also wish to have a family that I can take the rap for I'm fine It is fate... that brings people together It is also fate... that drives them apart Meetings and partings are all decided No need to blame heaven or destiny Mountains and seas are my testimony Do not fear the tempest swallowing our passion for no distance can keep our love apart Meetings and partings are all decided No need to blame heaven or destiny Mountains and seas are my testimony Your aunt texted us just now To be honest... we never expected to strike it rich... in the chilli sauce business It's okay whether we get to do it or not What matters is that we stick together Agreed You're all grown up now, it's okay I'm so sorry I trusted the wrong people It's okay It's good that it happens now It's better to get duped at age 24 than age 42 Your old man was duped when he was 24 by a woman It went on for twenty some years You're a clever boy You can turn over a new leaf Your old man can't Who duped you? Francis Kong (pun of "no comment" in Cantonese) Who was Francis Kong? Huh? You don't even know Francis Kong? You know her too? How come I don't know her? Who is Francis Kong? You don't remember Francis Kong? Do I know her? Who is Francis Kong? Molly Yau (pun of "makes no sense") Who is Molly Yau? Who is Francis Kong? Your reaction reminds me of another name That's Siu, Nancy Siu, Nancy (pun of "laugh my head off") You're going to make me Siu, Nancy I see... Francis Kong Siu, Nancy Your parents might forgive you But you signed the contract You had to deliver those 10,000 units regardless Naturally, my whole family... worked our asses off to complete that order I'm coming back next week Got anything for me?

Grandma has a big red packet for you You'll get it by mail The profit from those 10,000 jars of chilli sauce... just covered the 500-grand down payment that Mom lost I'm afraid we'll have to realize Mom's... home ownership dream in the future So... that's the end of my chilli sauce story So, what's your plan?
