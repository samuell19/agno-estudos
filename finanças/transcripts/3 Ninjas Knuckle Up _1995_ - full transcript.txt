As always, this summer started out with a trip to Grandpa's cabin. Grandpa said he'd teach us how to fly like real ninjas. - Tum Tum, people can't fly. - Ninjas can. Grandpa said so. Ah, he's just pulling your leg. We thought our summer would be really boring, the way it started out. But boy, were we wrong. Pull over, Grandpa! Busted. Whoa! So much for peace and quiet. What's going on? What's out there? Maybe a jackrabbit with a bad attitude. Good afternoon. As you can see, there's a good deal of confusion here, but one thing seems quite clear to me. There's something very rotten in the land of the eagles. Lousy Indians. Nothing but trouble. Hey... Get that reporter out of here. - We don't want a lady here. - Mr. Harding? This is no place for you all to be. I understand your concerns, people, but this isn't the way to do it. Give me that thing. You people get this through your heads. This is not your land. This is my land. You signed a lease! What I do with my land is my business. Now you'd better get the hell out of here, or I'm gonna have you arrested for trespassing. You're the one who should be arrested, Jack Harding. Your business is killing our people! No more dumping! No more killing! Cool. Indians! All right. Get in there. Start the trucks up. What's going on? I don't know, but it looks bad. Hey, that's my daughter! Jo? No more dumping! No more killing! Come along, now. Keep moving! Keep moving! Grandpa, let's go. Jack, call your boys off. Let me handle this. Shut up. All right, Ron. Dump it! Get back in there. Tum Tum. - Morning, Grandpa. - Morning, Rocky. - Morning, Grandpa. - Good morning, Colt. Tum Tum! I'm coming! I'm coming! There's no food in the refrigerator, Grandpa. Pizza! Pizza! - I won't get any gas. - Just get pepperoni. I'm not gonna get any fishes on my pizza, okay? All right. First one in gets to order. Hey, wait up! Hurry up, Grandpa. You go on ahead. I'm gonna get some groceries. Okay. - Pick up number 13. - Yes! Pick up number 14. That's us. Well, go get it. Pick up number 15. Well, well. Lookie here what the wind dragged in again. I told you to stop following us around. Where's my father? What did you do to him? I don't know what you're talking about. Get outta here. Don't do that. Wait. No, no, this ain't right. She's just a little girl. - She's too young for beer. - Let go of me! Why, you little... What? Anybody got a problem with that? I said, anybody got a problem with that? Yeah, I got a problem. Let me guess. You were too short for the good rides at the carnival. What's so funny about that? Why don't you buttheads just leave her alone? What did you say, punk? - I said, leave her alone. - Buttheads. Come here, you little brats. I'm gonna have to teach you some manners. Isn't it sad, though? Some kids just won't learn, will they? Get them! Thank you. Kid! Now you're gonna get it! Boy, this pizza's boss! Can't you see I'm trying to eat here? Yes. Look out! May I? I can't see! My eyes! I wouldn't touch that if I were you. Hey, dude. Who taught you how to walk? Colt! Don't! Colt, what the... Colt! Stop it! Tum Tum! Rocky! My pizza! - Don't fight. - I'm not fighting. - What are you doing? - Kicking butt. Well, stop it. I'll handle this. Shouldn't play with knives, man. It's a bad example. You're right. Bad example. Get those kids! I'll get you for this! You guys are great! Where'd you learn that stuff? It's just something our grandfather taught us. - Can you teach us, too? - Is it hard to learn? - No... - Yeah, it's pretty hard. What are your names? He's Rocky, he's Colt, and I'm Tum Tum. They're our ninja names. You guys are ninjas? I thought ninjas were bad guys. Nah. There's good ones and bad ones. Yeah, like dentists. Hey, grandpa. Over here! Did you see us cream those guys? We're leaving. But I haven't had my pizza yet! Wait... Yes, I understand. That's a good idea. The boys will be down there first thing in the morning. You're welcome. You're gonna have to pay for the damages to the pizza parlour. - Why? - They started it, Grandpa. That's beside the point. Let it be... A lesson to us. So you want to be heroes, do you? - Maybe I should stop giving you ninja lessons. - No! - You said we should help people in need. - I did. But that's not what I'm worried about. You're getting too cocky. Sit down! Listen. You're helping others so you can become heroes. That's not helping them, that's helping yourselves. It's a lie. Now this. This is what I meant by the correct path of a ninja. Flowers? See these beautiful flowers? You must learn to be like them. You mean stand in dirt and smell good? Very funny. Listen to the sound of the flower. It could teach you how to walk the correct path. Do they speak English? Listen to them. Hear the sound of the flowers blooming. Only then can you become a true ninja. Why can't you just tell us? I could teach you a lot of things. But some things you have to learn by yourself. Colt! Let me out! Other one. Hi, guys. - Hi. - I'm Jo. I'm filthy. I mean, Rocky. Hi, filthy Rocky. What? Hi. Your grandfather told me you guys were down here. You're doing this because of me? No, it's part of our ninja training. You were something else yesterday. I can't believe you're real ninjas. I know what you mean. We look more like garbage ninjas today. Can I help? Thanks for sticking up for me yesterday. Oh, it was nothing. - Who were those guys, anyway? - Why were you following them? Do you really want to know? Believe it or not, it all has to do with garbage. This is really ruining my appetite. - So, you think those three guys kidnapped your father? - I know they did. Nobody would believe me, though. Everybody thinks he went off on some business trip. That's what the mayor says. - The mayor? - Yeah. My father works for him. The day before my dad disappeared he told me and Mom he found something at the mayor's office. Some secret about the landfill. What secret? I don't know exactly, but he said it would make them close down the landfill for good. They throw all kinds of stuff in there. Not just trash. They're killing the land. And without land, there's no life. As for man, his days are as the grass. As a flower in a field, he flourishes... ...then gone. But the eternal life lies in our souls. And it is these shining souls that go on to God. Amen. So, what do we do now? What can we do? We've done everything we could. Obviously, we didn't. People are still dying! How many more are we going to bury? If I can just find my father, I know all the problems will be solved. Our people will stop dying. We'll help find your father, Jo. - You will? - Yeah, we will. - So, your father's been missing a whole week now? - Uh-huh. Where do we start looking, guys? How about the cops? My mom and I already tried the police, but they wouldn't listen. We gotta start looking somewhere. How about there? - Come on. - Where are we going? - Jo, can you watch our bikes? - Sure. Jack, we got a little problem. Jack, take it easy. Don't have another heart attack. Jack, those Indians are causing more trouble. They've got a table set up in town for signatures. Okay, Jack. We'll be right over. - We'll get them, J.J. - Shut up. What did Jack have to say? Do I ever tell you guys what Jack has to say? No! - Come on, get out. - Shut up! Grow up, you idiots. It stinks! What is this stuff? Don't touch it! I was only gonna taste it. See anything like a wrench or something? What kind of a mayor are you, anyway? A bunch of Indians raising Cain in front of your city hall, of all places, and you don't do anything about it! They haven't broken any law yet, Jack. Do something before they do! Give me that. No smoking in here, it's bad for your heath. I quit. What are they saying? Wake up! Imbeciles. What are they saying? Let me hear! They want a hearing with the Environmental Protection Agency. They're making a big case out of this. Even the news people are beginning to be a little curious. Told you not to hire that Indian in the first place. It doesn't matter. I'll take care of him and the disk. You just remember one thing. I built your city hall and your town. So, if anything happens to me... I understand. Good. As long as we understand each other. When can we have this meeting? Tomorrow, if you like. It's your town, Jack. - Do it. Let's get it over with. - Okay. J.J., you go back and you keep working on that Indian. And if that disk shows up at the hearing... You're gonna be dog meat, son. Do you understand me? Sure, Jack. Give it! Get out of here. Hey. Step in it. Out of my way! Wake up. What is it now? Three days without food? Four. I figured you'd have trouble with math. Shut up. Okay, J.J. Let's get cracking. Yep. He's here, all right. And we will get that disk today. Let's go. Let's go! Come on! Come on, Tum! What now, guys? The manhole! What happened? We found him! We found him! - You did? - We're pretty sure, anyway. Very sure. - Really? - Yep. I love you guys! You'll just have to use your imagination, girl. Oh, and I just took a bath, too. So, what's the plan now, guys? We go get him out. We? As in you and us? Yes, we. You guys, and the girl. Wait a minute. Colt, I think it's okay. Okay, but we'll have to hurry, because they're gonna start the hearing tomorrow. Tonight, then. Tonight. Tonight? Tonight. Good night, Grandpa. Good night, boys. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Where's Jo? What's taking her? Women. She's probably putting on makeup. Tum, why don't you go find her? - What happened to you? - What happened to you? It's just war paint, Tum. Jeez. Scary! That's the point. It's really cool. Can we use some of that? Okay, but you have to hurry up. Hurry up, she says. Okay, let's go. Whoa. Awesome! Embarrassing. - Come on. - Wait, wait. That's better. Very cool. What is this? Mercedes Benz? It means peace, pizza brains. Peas? I hate peas. Dad! - Dad! - Jo? Dad, are you all right? I was so scared. You okay? I was so worried. - Come on! Come on! - Break it up. We gotta go. I'm sorry I woke you up, Jack. No, everything's under control. The Indian, Jack. The kids kinda got him. But we'll get 'em, Jack. We'll get 'em. I promise you, we'll get 'em. Here they come. I got you now! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Jo, stop. Stop. Don't shoot the arrows anymore. Come on! We gotta go! Let's go! They're getting away! Nunchakus! Colt, catch! Let's go! Let's go! Stop it! Leave him alone! Dad, are you okay? Get the quiver. The disk is in it. - The disk? - The disk! Disk?! Get the disk! The disk! It's up there! The disk! Go! We'll get it! I got it! I got it! I don't got it. Rock, I lost it. It fell off. Get that kid! He's getting away! Come on, let's go. I'm going. I'm going. Kids! Don't move. Come on, boy. Come on. Be careful. He likes it. Good job, Tum Tum. Hi, guys. Surprise! The dog! Hurry up! No, this way! - Come on, let's get them! - No! I got a better idea. This'll be a gas! Kiddie fry. Run! Run! Get up! Rocky, you go first. - Is it clear? - Yeah, come on. Boy, I'm hungry. - Tum Tum! Come here! - Come here! Get upstairs. Hi. Go to sleep, Tum Tum. Night, Grandpa. Come on, boys. Let's go. Oh, Grandpa. Without breaking the eggs. Get out of the way. Thanks, Grandpa. I really needed that. Get out of there. Tum Tum... Tum Tum! Tum Tum... Wake up, Tum Tum! What's wrong with you guys? Didn't you sleep last night? - I had a terrible dream. - I did too. - About this big ugly dog. - A couple of them. - You all had the same dream? - Yeah, and ugly cowboys. We were in it together. Tonight, I want you all to sleep early. No games. And no comic books. No midnight snack. Okay, Grandpa. We'll go to bed early. We promise. You all promise? We promise. - Is this cool, or what? - It's cool. Very cool. Hello. I am Chief Roundcreek. It's a shame we grownups didn't have the courage and the wits to do what you young people have done. Thank you for giving us back our courage. And thank you for giving us new hope to heal the wound that's been causing us so much pain. To show our appreciation, we would like to present you with a gift. - Whoa! - Cool! Eagle feathers are considered by my people to be the highest symbol of honor, courage, given only to the greatest of warriors. Even though you are not of our blood, we believe you deserve this recognition. Therefore, I name you honorary warriors. Now, we are as one. Wow, what a day. This is better than Christmas. All right. Yeah. - Let's show 'em our dance. - Yeah. - You go first. - No, you go. - Go ahead. - You. No. - What's going on? - Here we go again. What a day. Come on! Don't run! Don't run! We're gonna make our stand here and now! Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap. Enough! Don't push it. Now. Hold him! Take him! Hold him! Bring him here. Where is it? I don't know. Do it to him, boss! It's in the house, isn't it? What was that? I don't know, but get in there and find out, you idiot! It's empty! Like your head, idiot! Get in there! What in tarnation? - You said it was empty. - It ain't. I think someone's in there. Grandpa! Hi. - How you doing? - Okay. Not anymore! Catch! Bye-bye. We gotta get out of here! This is dangerous! Come back here! We're not finished yet! Pull out! Everybody out! And you can just forget about bowling this week! - Cake! - Yeah! - Are you hurt? Are you all right? - We're fine. - How about you? - Oh, I'm fine. I think. - Are you okay? - Tum Tum, why did you do that? Psych! - What do we do now? - Call off the hearing. We can't do that. The newspeople will be there. It'll look real bad. All right! All right! We gotta figure out how to keep that disk out of the hearing. Professionals. That's what we need. - Professionals? - Yeah, you know any? I know a good lawyer. I'm talking about mercenaries, you moron! - Yeah, I do. - Good. Get on the horn, right now. Not that! The phone, you idiot! We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed... How you feeling now, Grandpa? I feel like a tired old man. I wish you boys would let me stay in retirement. You were great, Grandpa. Better than any 65-year-old I know. - Sixty-four. - Sorry. I'm sorry we worried you, Grandpa. It's all right. I know you boys won't do it again. Or will you? No! Peace and quiet again. Nothing but the sound of old bones creaking... ...and the flowers turning in for the night. Should we go without telling Grandpa? We gotta go for Jo. - What could happen? - I'd rather not find out. So you don't really like her or anything, right, Rock? - Who? - Her. Jo. No. Well, she's all right. Good. Because thinking about girls and stuff can distract a ninja's concentration. Whoa! Colt. Are you all right? I guess it can distract your concentration. Jo! Hi, Rocky. How do you feel? A little sore here and there. Nothing major. That's good. I'm alive too, if you're just dying to know. Hi, Colt. How are you? I'm pretty banged up, but I'll manage. Here. This is for you. How sweet. That's a Malibu Ninja! - I hope you like it. - I like it a lot. It's really neat. See, its legs move to do kicks. Picking flowers, huh? Yes, to make medicine for your wounds. Why are you talking to them, though? I'm explaining to them why I am picking them off their roots. They can't understand you, can they? They may not understand my words, but they know my feelings. - Do they ever say anything back to you? - Sometimes. But they don't have to. Because they know they are helping me. And that is the way. We all help one another... ...because we are all brothers and sisters. I think I have enough here. Jo, here comes your father. Come on! Let's go! Okay, kids, come on. Hop in. Come on, Rocky. We're gonna be late for the hearing. Hold on, I'm coming! Come on, kids. Put your seat belts on. What's going on? He's blocking the road! What's that? Bikers. Trouble. Let's go! Move! Go! Give me the stick! I think these guys woke up on the wrong side of the cage this morning. That's cool! I mean, terrible. I knew this wasn't gonna be easy, but this is ridiculous! Charlie, what do we do? - We gotta get out of here. - Go! I'm gonna bust through. Step on it! Look out! - It's a stink bomb! - Don't breathe! Jo! No! Mom! - So, what do we do now, guys? - We should tell somebody. We don't know where they're taking her. Mister, can you take care of her? Yeah, I'll take care of her. Come on. Get in. - Rocky, you don't drive. - I do now. - Jo. Where's Jo? - I don't know. Are you okay? Jo! How am I doing? Slow down! Is this slow enough for you? Fasten your seat belt, Tum, and start praying. Don't worry. I've had practice. Yeah, I can tell. Rocky, this isn't like driving in the arcade! Yeah, but think of all the quarters I'll save this way. Who are you? What do you want? Shut up and be still, little lady. There they are! Do you see 'em? I see them! Take it easy! Relax. I've got the whole situation under control. - I don't like this! - Slow down. They're turning! - Shortcut. - Oh, God! - Get back on the road! - I'm going, I'm going! Can we slow down? Oh, God, please don't let me die. I'll be good! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! Calm down, nobody's gonna... Die! Oh, God, please! I'll never do drugs! I'll never look at TV again! I'll be good! I promise! I'll become a policeman! - Rock! Rock! - What? I'll always flush the toilet! And I'll never eat in bed! Even if I'm starving to death! And Brussels sprouts will be my favourite food! And peas! I love peas! And lima beans! Shut up! Use the brake! The brake, you stupid! And I'll never call anybody names! I wish I were blind! Close your eyes! - I think I'm gonna throw up. - Not on me! I'm not gonna do it on me! That was pretty close, huh? I'll never drink and drive! I'll never drive! I'll take the bus! Ooh, I love busses. I'm too little to die! I want to make puberty at least! Shut up! Let me out! Come on, Tum. I'll wait for you guys here. Tum, get in! Pick me up on the way back. - Go! Go! - Guys, come on! Go! Rocky, the road's back there! I know! We gotta do something, Charlie! Hang on! Do you see them? I think I see them this way! Let's go! Charlie. The phone's for you. Hello? Your little girl wants to say, "Hi." I'm okay, Dad. Don't worry. Jo... Is everything okay, Charlie? Yeah, everything's all right. May we come to order, please? Thank you. Now, before we begin our hearing today, I would like to present you to Mr. Dean Thompson. He's with the Environmental Protection Agency. He's here to oversee our hearing. Right! Left! No, right! - Stop! I can see now! - Sorry, force of habit. "There's no place like home. There's no place like home." There's the jeep! Cool place. I don't like this. - It's too quiet. It's like they're... - Waiting for us. Kids don't belong here. Go. And gorillas belong in the zoo. What? Get him, man! Had enough? You guys should put your training wheels back on. - We give up. - Lock us up. - Throw away the key. - Go! I got it! You look like a dork, you walk like a dork. Which one is first? Does it matter? You can't count past one, anyway. Come on. Wait! Wait! Wait! Sorry. Wait a minute! Come on. Try the ladder, moron! Come on, you runt! Not there! Those are some very serious accusations you made. I hope you have evidence to back it up. Oh, we most certainly do, mayor. Charlie? Go on. Come on, Charlie. Tell them about the disk. I have this computer disk. It's a series of reports from a research group regarding the... Go on, Charlie! I'm sorry. I don't feel well. You'll have to excuse me. It's all right. They want you back inside. Everything's gonna be all right. Just give them the disk. Tell them you made a mistake. Come on, Tum. Come on. This way, Tum. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friends? You... You... You kid! Hey, that's not funny! You little creep! I can't see! I can't see! Whoa! Jo! No! Stop! Please! Wipeout! Jo, where are you? - Rocky, over here! - There she is! - Come on! - Over here! - Where? - There! Come on! Who are those kids? Kids from hell, man. Hey, go check the window. Yeah, I think we're safe here. Sorry. Sorry. Come on. Go get them! Come on! - Good job, Tum Tum. - Come on, Tum! Come on. Oh, man. Who's nasty? Take a bath. Well, come on! What are you waiting for? - You think buses run out here? - Come on! Get in! Don't worry. I think I'm getting the hang of this thing now. Rocky! - That tree came out of nowhere! - About 100 years ago. Garbage cans! I saw that one. Really, I did. Next time, try to see it before you hit it. Settle, please. The girl got loose. Don't let her get in here. Go on! You were saying about some reports from a research company. What exactly did these reports say? It says that there's all kinds of chemicals in the ground water. What kinds of chemicals? Dioxin, TCP, asbestos, and cyanide. And you have the computer disk that contains all this information here with you? - Yes. - May I see it? Let's have it! Well, may I? Let's bring them a little surprise. What is this? A joke? What's the problem? There's nothing here but a bunch of weather reports from last year. See? What did I tell you? They're making all this stuff up! Let me have the other disk. You want to see your little girl alive again? Come on, Jo! Dad! - Let me have it! - Okay. Dad! Are you all right? Did you see that? That Indian assaulted me! We made a mistake. This is the real disk. I know what you're thinking, punks. Why don't I pick on somebody my own size? Now you are my size! So, what do you think? Consider the landfill shut down permanently. I'll get you. - This isn't over yet. - Oh, I think it is, Mr. Harding. It's very over. Wait up, guys! Where are the guys? I don't know. Where are the little heroes? This feels good. Is it over now? I sure hope so. Boy, will I have a story to tell when I go back to school! I wonder if anyone will believe me. Listen. You're helping others so you can become heroes. That's not helping them. That's helping yourselves. Hear the sound of the flowers blooming. It can teach you how to walk the correct path. I get it now. What? The sound of the flowers. Where? You heard the flowers? What? I don't hear anything. That's the whole point. I didn't hear them. Come on, let's go. What did they say? Come on, guys! How did it go? - Fine. - Good! So, Grandpa, what do the flowers say when you water them? The same thing they say when they bloom. Which is...? Nothing. They don't want to show off how pretty they are. They just want to be pretty. Right? Right! Grandpa, now will you teach us how to fly? Are you kidding? People can't fly. But ninjas can! - Get set, go! - Right! You gonna kiss her, Colt? - Who? - Her! Jo! - No... - Yes, you are! Colt's gonna kiss Jo! Colt's gonna kiss Jo! Colt's gonna kiss Jo! Come on, guys! Okay, okay. Maybe I will. What?!
