So this weekend we are doing two different costumes, and tonight I'm going to be Tinderella. Tinder, it's a dating app, and so a lot of cheesy pickup lines on there are, "You could be my Tinderella?" So I'm going to be everybody's Tinderella. So we are going to head over to Amanda's, who's one of my best friends since college, we had a couple classes together. We're gonna head over to her house and pre-party. After we go to Amanda's, we're going to go to The Gin Mill, which is all you can drink, unlimited booze, which is always dangerous, so we'll have to figure out how to pace ourselves on all you can drink, which is going to be the challenge of the night. So last year, I got out of a really serious relationship. Drinking definitely eases the dating world. I've been on very few first dates where you don't drink, because it takes the edge off. The whole point in drinking is to turn off your brain for once, when you're using it all day, every day, so it's nice to just turn it off, not think about anything... and just let go. Basically I didn't drink all week knowing I was going to drink a ton this weekend. So I figure, it all balances out in life. Instead of having a glass of wine a night, I won't have any and then I'll have like, five tonight. Let's be honest, probably like ten. But it's Okay. Woman: Hey! (loud chattering) How are you?

I think a lot of people worry, is this young adult going to turn into somebody with a chronic problem. The consequences literally go up like this depending on the amount you're drinking and the frequency that you're drinking. Binge drinking for women is having four or more drinks in a single drinking episode, and for men it's five or more. And when you consume alcohol at that rate, your blood alcohol level gets up to be around .08 or beyond, which is the legal limit for driving. You're getting more impulsive. You have a hard time making good decisions. So this is a huge set up for accidents to happen and they can be serious and life-altering. You've got increased risk of physical violence, sexual assaults, unwanted pregnancies. These are all things that really can change the course of your life in a single night. Young binge drinkers really underestimate how much it affects their overall quality of life. You know, they're fighting with their friends, there's lots of drama in their lives. They're breaking up with their boyfriend when they're intoxicated and regretting it the next day. So there's lots of suffering, I think, that goes on that is kind of whitewashed away because people think, "Oh it's just fun. We're just having a good time." Things have changed in terms of how we think about alcohol use disorders. It used to be black and white: you either have the problem or you don't have the problem. The way we view drinking now is really on a spectrum of risk. And binge drinking automatically places you in the mild to moderate range. If you drink more than you intend, have withdrawal symptoms, and find yourself craving alcohol. The reality is people have varying degrees of the problem and they often cycle in and out. But there is a very small bunch that is way more at risk. People who are in heavy drinking crowds, so they've got lots of friends who are drinking in the same way. People who have a high tolerance for alcohol, and then people who drink in response to negative emotional states, so they drink because they're feeling down or they're anxious or they can't sleep. When you get a little wobbly, when you start to get a little sleepy, that's your natural braking system of your body saying, "Hey I've had enough alcohol, stop drinking." And when people override that system and they keep drinking, those brakes, they're getting worn out, so that you lose the ability to stop because you're just not in control anymore. So when you're trying to reduce your drinking, you've got to really find the point at which you lose control, and for most people that's no more than three for women and no more than four for men. ♪ ♪ Can I do another dark and coke?

One day we were at Sapphire Bar & Grill. We're down there drinking, she went out by the pool, I went in to pay the tab, I come out and she's gone. So I walk up the hill to my condo, and she's like passed out in front of the door. So I get up there, you know, kick her a little bit, you know, "Get up!" You know, open the door. Fuck, next thing I know, she got a knife in her hand coming at me with a fucking knife. What? No way! Yeah, I mean... Look at this shit. No shit? A stabbing here. That's what it looked like when it happened. Oh my-- Is that in the doctor's office? No, that was when I was at home. I kept putting Band-Aids on it, thinking, "Oh, I can--" (laughing) "I can stop this myself, you know, no need for a doctor." And everybody's like, "She stabbed you!" It's like, it was a drinking incident, who cares? It was a misunderstanding, you know? Mike: When she stabbed me, grabbed her arm, trying to get the knife out of her arm, snapped her wrist. You know what scares me shitless? That we're gonna drink like that, we're gonna be back together, one of us is gonna up that. My life, I mean, it's a house of cards falling. I need to fix this fucking problem. I mean, I got my kids depending on me. I got my ex-wife, my wife, all kind of people depending on me. I wanna fix it. Mike: You know, usually by the time somebody wants to get help, they're, you know, no job, living in a trailer. I wasn't that way. I showed up at work every day. You know, worked for a big company, and, you know, had a prestigious job. And, you know, was the on-air, you know, co-host. I was fill-in when somebody was on vacation. I would never have a drink during the day. But then I started getting pulled into sales meetings and happy hours, and it escalated. But then as things didn't go well at home, it escalated more. And, you know, it was an easy escape. And I guess what's really hard is, you know, I finally had another relationship that I really wanted. And through drinking and other things, I fucked it up. I mean, I had it, and, you know, I don't want to see things go out of my life because I fucked it up. She told me she won't talk to me tonight if I'm hammered. And, you know... So if I have something that's important to me, I'm gonna make it happen and that's, you know, why I haven't drank anything today. I mean, a cold beer would fucking taste great right now. It's hot, but I'm still being-- trying to be good. Hey, you. Woman: Hey, I don't see you yet. I'm on a slow Wi-Fi, so it should be coming up. Imagine that. So, are you sure you want me to come back and stay with you in Denver? I got a lot of work ahead of me to try to get all this shit fixed. Well, there's a lot to fix, but, you know... I'm confident this program is gonna work for me, and I do wanna make changes. And it's kind of cool when I don't drink and, you know, actually sit around and think about stuff. It makes more sense. Why now? Why is it gonna work now? What's different now? Because I'm tired of throwing my life away. You know, I wanna be the guy that shit goes right for, not getting it this far from right and then something fucks up, you know. Not chasing away the people I love. Yeah, you know how I define the six-- nine months with you? There was so much chaos. There was no peace. There was no thought other than the 9-1-1 crisis at hand. How about we work hard and get us both fixed? They don't have rehab for idiots. They have a rehab for alcoholics, drug addicts... pill poppers, people with eating disorders, but they don't have rehab for stupid motherfuckers who put up with your shit. I love you, we'll get through this. I want to. But how do we make it non-self-destructive? Wear helmets? (laughs) That is not good. We're gonna have fucking plastic utensils in the house, no knives. There's your side of the story, there's my side of the story, and then in between is the truth. And I know I escalated things and you escalated things, and then it just got to a point that I had hoped you were so drunk... that you'd just kill me. (crying) I don't remember any good times. (sniffles) I'm struggling. I'm really struggling. You took every part of my life hostage. And yet, I'm still here talking to you, and I'm still here wanting to help you, and I'm still here... wanting to make sure that you're okay. And I'm not okay. Well, I'm gonna be back there to see you and make sure you're okay. (crying) Look, believe in me that I'm trying on this 'cause I am. I do wanna get better. I don't like the way things are. You've never been a partner. You've just been another child. I'm trying to-- It'd be nice to see someone that's a partner. Well, hopefully I can learn that. Do you love me? (smacking) Marcia: I don't know. I'm kind of excited. Schoolgirl nerves. I just wanna give him a hug. And then I wanna kick him in the balls. So, how's that? (laughs) Our relationship is bat-shit crazy. It never calms down. It's just always putting the fire out. It's self-destructive for me to support him, but now that he wants to get help, and he... is willing to make the change, not based on anyone else's decision but his... is why I'm here. It's his decision. What? Wow. No. You're fat. You're fatter than shit. I'm not that fat. You are so fat. Missed you. You're not gonna remember where you parked. You never-- Stop it. You never know where the car is. We're gonna walk the fuck around in circles looking for the car. Or do you know-- Why you gotta call me out on my stuff? I'm happy to be home. But this isn't your home. You haven't deserved it yet. Kick your shoes off. Cheers. Yeah. Okay, so we met. Things were great. When the kids were here all summer, you were amazing. We did everything together. I know. It was great when your kids were here. Right. But then when the little ones went back east, twisted Mike came out. It's like whoosh. Because you never hit me before that. You never grabbed me. You never put me in a corner. I've never had my nose broken my whole life. Or your jaw. You've broken it three times and my jaw. Maybe you shouldn't back me in a corner. You gotta understand what you're going to do and what you need to do is not just affecting you, it's affecting many lives. I know. I miss all the fun we had. Well, we had fun until you became an insecure fucking asshole. You're a fucking asshole. What did I do? Sit and talk to me. I'm an adult. The whole fucking thing is-- Yeah, 'cause now that you've walked fucking two miles, you're fucking sober. I don't know how far it was, it was over an hour. You know what? Maybe you should see how you treat people when you're fucking drunk, and the only thing you care about is going to buy your goddamn cigarettes, and your eyes are all crazy, and they're fucking glassed over, and realize how you fucking treat people. 'Cause this is the part that I want nothing to fucking do with you. Shit, you snap out over fucking nothing. Oh, really? Yeah, really. You can't remember fucking your drunken highs. You don't know the difference between a drunken haze and reality. From this point on, I'm done. Go through your fucking rehab. Because every fucking word that comes out of your goddamn mouth is a goddamn drunken lie. So enjoy my place, I'm out, fuck you. Hey, don't forget your pie.

And it was hard, is that once I got back here and she went back to Colorado it's like that distance increased and, you know, things changed. You know, we got into a fight and she told me, "Well you're too needy. "I can't talk with you," this and that. And I said shit that the sober me would have never, you know, never said or texted. I'm actually surprised the fucking drunk me could spell and do all that shit, but it's, you know, not stuff I'm proud of. I made a bunch of new friends and doctors and everything through this that, you know, if I was having a problem I could have called. I didn't choose to reach out to any of them. You know, somebody sitting there on the other end of the phone saying, "Well, you know you're doing a good job, don't drink," and this and that. That doesn't fucking count for it or take away the feeling, and anyone who's ever drank to cover something up fucking knows that. It doesn't cover up that feeling. Drinking numbs it out, and I didn't have to worry about it. They have fucked me up because they made me measure everything and, you know, now that's in my head. The other night was hard. I, you know, went out and bought two liters of rum. And, you know, had the intent of if I drink both of them, I don't have to wake up in the morning. And, you know... woke up and had one hell of a fucking hangover, but, you know, luckily nothing another bottle wouldn't fix. I would love to learn to moderate my drinking and hopefully through that minimize a lot of the problems in my life. But I don't know if I'll ever be moderate. I like getting fucked up. So I guess that's... gonna be the hard part with it, you know? But I think if I don't get the drinking under control, I'm gonna lose my wife and kids. If I haven't already. ♪ ♪ A lot of people don't sign up for abstinence and don't want abstinence, and that's okay. You don't say, "Well I won't treat you." There's a very big spectrum of drinking, and what you want to do is prevent people who are somewhere in the beginning parts or the middle from progressing to the end. If you don't think someone can moderate their use, you shouldn't say to them, "I can teach you how to moderate your use." You'd say, "The safest best prescription is abstinence, "but if you want to do moderation management, "it doesn't just mean you try to moderate, "there's a whole technique. You monitor your drinking and you report back." The key is to get people the right medication, the right psychotherapy, to individualize it, and put all of the treatment elements together. ♪ ♪ There's three FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for alcoholism: Antabuse, Acamprosate and Naltrexone. Antabuse, if you drink makes you sick, and so it pairs drinking with this aversive experience. It helps people stay sober. Acamprosate diminishes craving and insomnia associated with alcoholism, and it helps people who are newly sober from being detoxified stay sober. Naltrexone can help people go from heavy, problematic drinking to more moderate, contained drinking. But they're only prescribed less than half a percentage of the time for the people that have alcoholism in America. You know, recovery isn't someone gets sober and stays sober forever. That's pretty rare. The majority of people will have relapses and slips, and rather than see that as a failure, it's usually the path towards recovery-- that slips and relapses can be learning opportunities. The other mistake made in treatment is when the treatment is given, it's given in short-term bursts-- you know, a week of detox, a one-month rehab. You'd never treat diabetes like that. You'd never take a diabetic and give them three days or a month of treatment and assume that they're okay. This is like any other chronic medical illness. It requires a long-term solution. The main problems for both men and women develop in the 30s and 40s. And that group of individuals, it's key to do something earlier on and to use all the tools that can help shift someone to using less or towards abstinence. ♪ ♪ (cork pops) Whoo! ♪ Do what you wanna do, what you wanna do ♪ I'm Rhonda. ♪ Do what you want ♪ Cheers.

I don't think she is drinking too much when she is drinking. It kind of just all of a sudden happens. I drink because I enjoy cooking and drinking wine while I cook. To have a glass of wine while you're cooking, to me... Oh, my God. ...it's just relaxing. I think you guys just came up with this idea that you guys, "Oh, I'm gonna pretend that I like food", "because that is a great excuse." Like, I'm like, "Fuck that, I'm a single mom." I am a ravioli in a can, in a bowl, and I just drink. Because I don't have anybody I have to impress. I think it's enjoying life... I do have kids I have to feed. ...versus making it through life. And we enjoy-- We enjoy life. She makes it through life. (laughing) No, I'm kidding. You are right. Okay, so... yesterday I knew that Olivia was graduating from fifth grade and there was gonna be a thing. And then my ex is sending me text messages about if our daughter doesn't wear a dress, she's gonna lose 25 percent points off of her grade or whatever. And he was like, Oh, my God. "You know what?" He goes, "I think my girlfriend-- "I think my 25-year-old girlfriend has a dress she can wear." And that's where it all fucking goes downhill, because it's kind of like I have the one glass, and I know this isn't gonna be great, and then I think, "Oh well, I'll just have--" and then I had a third glass, and then I had another glass, and then I had a bottle or whatever. But you were apprehensive about it, you were nervous and insecure about it, and this was an excuse. Yeah, and that's what happens. And I said, "You know what?" I said, "I'm not gonna make Olivia's graduation", "Could you cover for me?" I texted him. I was like, "I can't see you there with her", "and know that I'm going to this school "where I have no friends." I had nobody to go with. I'll just get shitfaced or something. Subconsciously. Kind of. I suck. Who misses their fucking daughter's graduation? An asshole. It's fifth grade. I mean, who graduates from fifth grade? Yeah, they have a graduation for every year now. Who graduates from fifth grade? They graduate from preschool, they graduate from kindergarten, they grad-- I mean... It's ridiculous. I just hate it. Rhonda: I'm just not gonna tell a grown woman what to do, so whatever her decisions are, I respect her autonomy. Sometimes she tries to keep her drinking in check, and sometimes she is just like, "You know what? No holds barred." Noel: No, I think what I got tired of as far as parenting is like kind of having that question like, "Did I feed you dinner last night?" and not really know it. Or like getting tired of my kids saying, "Mom, we've told you that," and like, just hating... That's why I'm not saying it's a problem, but I definitely feel like there's times when you need to check yourself, and that is one of them for me. Remember at the beginning of the year, I went 10 whole days. Noel: I went four months. Woman: Do you feel like since you... since you did that and then you've gone back to it that you have that, been better check? I feel like I failed at that. I failed. And so now, I just give myself permission. I'm like what the hell, might as well drink at 11:00. Parenting is tough. I just feel for you. Like, you need support groups for that, you know? Rhonda: We're the support group. Exactly. That's right. Cheers to everything... (laughter) Cheers to everything. Shut up! Noel: Wine to me means escape. I know without alcohol who I want to be. I want to be Oprah. I want to be Maya Angelou. I want to be... I want to be amazing. I want to be a rock star. And when I drink, I'm not that awesome. And I don't remember. I can't keep track of the girls' schedules and I can't keep... And I just... And I'm stuck. But, I mean, honestly, I don't care what Ron-- whatever Ron is doing. Noel is stuck. And she has, um... She's afraid of everything. I've asked my dad, like, um... my adoptive father, like... like, "Don't you want me to have my own gun? 'Cause I live alone and I have two girls," and he was like-- And my dad-- and my adoptive father, he's like, "I'd be afraid you'd use it on yourself." And it's the smartest thing he's ever done. Woman: Noel, where's this going? I missed my daughter's graduation last night. I wouldn't-- I wouldn't miss it. I mean... (distant train horn blowing) I don't know. I don't know. Noel: When I woke up this morning, I was hungover. Like I took 800 milligrams of ibuprofen. A couple of times. What do I do the next day? Damage control. I go back and apologize, and I'll delete texts. I'll just delete it. That didn't happen. I just feel full of shame or-- or embarrassment. Hmm. I reach a point where I don't remember. I want to say I blackout. I don't like that word. You would think I would stop. Olivia, do you know of anything we need from the grocery store? Other than everything. What about, um, snacks, school snacks? Do you think we need more... Or, not more, but like, something else? Probably. Um, we need another dinner idea. How about soup? How about kale and... Beans. white bean soup. Okay. Okay. Sounds healthy. All right. (chuckles) I can always go back to the store. But yeah. Okay. You go to your dad's tomorrow anyway, so. (dishes clink) Drinking impacts my relationship with my kids. Okay... Both: One, two, three! (laughs) I went higher. Awesome. I want to be able to moderate. I want to be able to function. I don't feel like I'm doing a very, um, good job at functioning right now. I don't think I want to be completely sober. Like, I just-- I don't... (sighs) And it's frustrating. Because I fall back. Olivia: I'll see you in a little bit. Bye, guys. I'm noticing now that I just start drinking earlier. ♪ ♪ It's a chart-- that our house is... an example of my mind. Like, it-- Like, okay. (television plays indistinctly) Okay. Eyeliner. Over the last three months, I feel like I've lost the drive to want to quit drinking. Like the motivation to quit. I know that there are tool things out there. I don't do any of it. I stay in this negative... I-- And I just... um... I'm here because of Olivia and Eva. But when I look to the future, there's nothing. I wanted to be a role model for my girls instead of them parenting me. Sometimes that's what it feels like. The message to my girls is that I'm not a drunk and that I do have good qualities. I just want them to see me go to work. I... don't want them to see me lay in bed. I do think over the summer Noel's drinking maybe progressed. Um... I think maybe she's kind of just... you know, putt no limits on herself and... hasn't tried to moderate. Like if you-- I don't know. Last year, it was kind of like, "I'm gonna have two glasses of pinot grigio and that's what I'm gonna do." And then sometimes she would succeed. But now she doesn't really try to do that. We know that she's depressed the next day or whatever it is and we just kind of-- we maybe sit on her porch and talk to her. But you know what? It doesn't really make anything happen. I mean, you can only do that for so long. So, I think we've all been just sitting around hoping it would go away. Um... And I feel like that was kind of negligent. Rhonda: When are we going to Napa Valley, peeps? Let's just do this. This is awesome. My husband told me I'm not-- can't go anywhere. Because of the layoff we're not allowed to go anywhere. (laughter) (overlapping chatter) Is that what that little hole is for in the bottom of the... That was sexy. Rhonda: Okay, so Noel and I talked today. Um, she's decided to so somethin' really kind of exciting, I think. What? What are you gonna do? Have a sex change. Shut up. You would look gorgeous, darling. And you guys will still accept me. Okay, anyway, okay, no, not really. I beat myself up about drinking. I like, I... I like my, um, alcohol. Woman: As do we. Rhonda has found somebody to help me with moderation. I want to be able to drink. I want to be able to go Okay. Oh! and have a couple of-- Okay, so it's not an all or nothing thing. No, not at all. That's why it's called moderation management. It's not an all or none. It's... it's a... different theory. Okay. Was that what you would call it? We're not letting you talk, like... I didn't know it existed until I kind of came across it. I didn't know it existed and I'm like... that's what I... if and when I got to that point, that's what I would want. I mean, because Woman: Okay. as we all know, I don't want to stop drinking. And if there-- I mean, maybe it'll work. But it's worth a shot. Noel: I have... I... My attitude is that it absolutely will work. Like, I just, I want it to. Woman: Yay! That's awesome. I really do. I'm happy for you. Woman: Well, and I think the biggest thing is that you're excited about it. Yeah! Mm-hmm. Rhonda: I have always loved Noel no matter what. I'm always concerned about driving cars. Um, I'm concerned about her laying in bed and being depressed all day. Alcohol does not help that. So, maybe if she gets this in check, that other stuff can be worked out. And of course, I'd love to be able to go sit on her porch and still have a glass of wine. Go to a restaurant and not worry how is she gonna get home, you know, is anything bad gonna happen? We may or may not stay really close friends. I don't know, but, um... As long as she's okay, that's fine. This was a good night. Mature or not. Woman: Get your glass up. Put your glass up. Noel and I don't want to stop drinking. We just want to keep eating dessert. ♪ ♪ Sometimes, people do ask me when a woman should start to become concerned about her drinking. I like to say that it's when alcohol becomes her friend, the thing that she turns to to relieve her stress, to numb her pain. Because when alcohol becomes a friend, it's firmly on the path to becoming a partner, and as a partner, it's poisonous. ♪ ♪ In the evolution of problem drinking, there's a progression from liking alcohol to wanting it, craving it, to needing it. When you start to use it to cope with stress and to feel better about your problems, it may develop into a habit. Then we're on that slippery slope where we could go on to develop an alcohol use disorder. You find yourself in this sort of vicious loop where depression and anxiety are making the drinking worse, the drinking is increasing the depression and anxiety. ♪ ♪ In a blackout, alcohol disrupts normal neurotransmission so that we lose awareness of what's going on in our physical environment and don't remember what happened to us during that particular time. And of course that places us at very high risk for so many unwanted consequences. It's very difficult to know exactly how much you're drinking when you're out in public. A single serving of alcohol is 12 ounces of beer, or five ounces of wine or one and a half ounces of liquor. But a server may bring you a drink that actually contains the alcohol equivalent of two or three drinks. So you think that you've had one drink when in fact you've consumed three, and over an evening of drinking that can really add up. The timing of intervention does matter. If we wait until later in the course of the disease, it's harder to stop drinking. The longer you're drinking, the greater the likelihood that you're going to experience withdrawal symptoms and that those withdrawal symptoms are going to be severe. ♪ ♪ It's all about a drink. Brother... it's... it's all about one drink. It's a horrible addiction. And... it doesn't go away. Ah, shit. I'm going to die. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Neal: I grew up in a nice, upper-middle class family. My mother didn't have to work. My dad made, uh, good money. He worked for the government. Had a good retirement. I was a Boy Scout, Cub Scout uh, safety patrol. You know, all the regular things. Went to college. ♪ ♪ I was 35 when my son was born, 39 when my daughter was born. I have a good relationship with my wife. I want people to think I'm a nice person and, you know, I just have this problem and I'm not afraid to admit it. I started drinking probably when I was 14. I've gone through treatment, I've gone to meetings. It is so hard to beat. I'm working a part-time job at a grocery store. That's all I've been able to get. (empty can clatters) I-- I just have to... I have to drink. And so, I come out to the car and drink. See the shaking? The drinking pretty much has to do now with DTEs. And now if I don't drink... I'll start shaking. For a long time, I thought it was some kind of palsy. But no, it's from drinking. And I can't, see, I can't keep it still unless I drink. It's not just shaking. It's sweating, and, uh, cramps, um... hurtin'. It's a nightmare. And I-- I call it Groundhog Day because it's the same thing every day. It's awful. I had my own business. I was making about $130,000 a year. And then the down-turn, people left. Um, I mean customers left. Then I went off the deep end. I just started drinking really hard. And... and I was playing in a band for nine years. I'm actually a great guitar player and they kicked me out for drinking. It's the worst of the worst. Know it's-- it's very painful to everybody, my family. My wife, my kids. I'm going to the hospital to detox so I can get through this nightmare. I just can't live like this anymore. My wife Kathy's stuck by me through all of it. 'Cause that's the caliber of woman she is. Come on. We don't want to-- don't want to lose your job. Uh, I might have to fall out of the car. Put some toothpaste in your mouth and let's go. (clears throat) You still got some toothpaste in your pocket? Think so. Let's go in and finish this gig up, and then we'll go home and get ready to go to the hospital. Let's just close it up and then we go. I'm dying. I feel like absolute shit. (can pops open) Hopefully, this is my last one. Kathy: I met him at church and we started seeing each other and I mean, we just clicked just right away. We just-- I mean, like that night. Just, you know, boom. He's just funny. He has a deadpan face, but, you know, but he's pretty funny. Um, we've been married not quite five years. You know, knew each other a few years before that. We got married at the church and Neal's two children were in the wedding. He was a great father. He used to take a blow dryer and blow dry the kids' sheets so they would be warm when they got in the bed. He told me that all he ever wanted to do was to be married... (sighs)... was to be married and have children. And that's all he's ever wanted to do. That's why it's so difficult to go through this. It makes you wonder, you know, why is he drinking and why is he doing this when he has had a great life and he can continue to have a great life? 'Cause he has people that love him and need him and need him to be sober. I think back, you know, to the person that I fell in love with, and... (sighs)... I want that man back so badly, so badly. That's it. Last hoorah. Kathy: You ready? Let's go. We'll get you taken care of, okay? Neal: I'll just work through it and it'll slowly go away. Once the shaking and all that goes away, that-- that's when they'll call it detoxed. Did they tell you what your blood alcohol level was? No. 0.32. You were here back in 2013 and then again in 2012. Do you remember any of those admissions? The fact that you have withdrawal symptoms, where you're still with alcohol in your system, it's only gonna get worse. As the alcohol starts leaving your system. Right. And it starts off with shakes. Your blood pressure goes up, your heart rate goes up. Can start seeing things, having hallucinations, and then it can progress where you have respiratory collapse and you can die. I've had a patient die from it. From DTs. Oh, we can ease you through this right now. If I have any other questions, I'll come back. I know where to find you. All right, dear. All right. Thanks a lot. See you later. My concern with this patient is... we can get him through this dangerous time with the alcohol withdrawal. But he's got a larger problem at hand, that detox is not curing his alcoholism. He's in a great deal of denial about how bad his problem is and how much control over his life the beer and the booze have taken. I've seen patients who have had alcoholic and alcohol-induced dementia who have completely cooked their livers and their nervous system where they can't walk anymore or they need transplantation but their alcoholism prevents it. He's at a point where he needs to make a decision, or it's going to be made for him. If he doesn't get help, he'll die. (coughing) Joshua? Are you getting ready to go to the zoo? What? You getting ready to go to the zoo? All right, let's go. I feel good. Um, I mean, I'm just glad that I'm pretty much 100% all the time. Doing all right? Oh! Can you see the giraffe and the monkey? See? Mm. Neal: I feel like I could handle the things I thought I could handle back in my 20s and 30s. Managing people and being able to focus on work and finish problems and everything. Not just get 'em out of the way so I can go have a drink. Here. Now go throw 'em in, buddy. Good one. I mean, the downtime is bad, but I can always go get Joshua. We'll go to the park, we'll go do something. Joshua, there's seals over here. You wanna see? I feel like I'm getting a second chance, uh, especially with Joshua. There it is! There he is. There he is. That's a big one. Neal: It's just like reliving the best parts of my life with my son. See how small it looks coming up? Oh. You fell in the water. And one thing I did learn from some of the different things that I went to, you know, sessions and things like that is when you want to drink, visualizing what you're missing. Like take my daughter to see something, you know, that she'd like to go see and not go in there and just wanting to see how many beers I can sneak off and buy. If I feel really great and jacked up, that's when I feel like having a drink. When I slip, I can't really remember exactly what went through my mind. All of a sudden, I'm drinking, you know? It's just like a, you know, a magnet pulls you there. Neal: Gonna swallow it. What happened is, I could not stop drinking. It's a chronic disease... and... I don't know how to beat it. I'm going to a treatment center. Maybe this'll be my last sip. I'm gonna go back again and-- and try to live a regular life. Kathy: I can tell he's really... he's really upset this time 'cause he's afraid he's not gonna have, uh... me to come back to. 'Cause he knows I've been through the mill with him and... he's gonna have to concentrate on himself. He's gonna have to... do what it takes to stay sober. I just can't keep doing this. Can't. Hey. Say, what did Joshua say? I don't know. I don't know. I think he said-- We've got to get out of here. Come on, get up. Of anything I say... my four-year-old son is saying. What are-- Grandson. My grandson. It's gonna be a rough ride to the airport. Seriously. Don't fall down. Sit, sit, sit. With him drinking vodka day in and day out, it makes his muscles weak where he cannot lift himself up off the ground. I mean, he falls-- he's fallen down so many times. I mean, just from this weekend, he's fell down three times and his son had to pick him up off the floor. I have to clean up after him like a baby. He's so drunk. I feed him 'cause I know he needs to eat. He'll even through up right after he eats. I mean, it's just awful. Hang on, we got-- You're gonna hold me, right? Okay. All right. I'll have to grab something. Just stand in front of me. (Kathy sighs) Neal (grunts): You know how you have to hold me up slowly. You're too tall. Kathy: This is the next thing. He's gonna go back to 35-day rehab and he's gonna go to a halfway house and if this doesn't do the trick for him, nothing will. And I-- this is my last hope right here and I will have to give up. ♪ ♪ Man: A person who's reached the stage of physical dependence has overwhelmed their brain's emotional systems. So the reason they can't stop is because they can't stop. It's the only relief they get from the terrors that are unleashed by not drinking. So one of the most important things about excessive drinking is that it changes your brain, and that's the basis for all the other problems. The first change is that you lose reward function in your brain, so your reward transmitters are just not working right. And as you keep drinking, you gain activity in your brain's stress systems. But an even more insidious part of this picture, is that you lose the ability of your frontal cortex to work properly. Now your frontal cortex is the part of your brain that makes you who you are, it's the part of our brain that we use to make decisions, choices, delay reinforcement. If you're losing that part of your brain, then you have no brake on impulsive behavior and stress-like responding. And that promotes this vicious cycle where you end up drinking to fix the problem that the drinking caused. These are changes that are very, very difficult to reverse. The brain does not grow back new neurons, but there is a way that the brain can strengthen other pathways that are already there. But it takes a long time, takes a major effort, and it takes complete abstinence. So what exactly does recovery look like in a person with a severe alcohol use disorder? Well, for the most part, it looks like a major effort to restructure your life without alcohol. How to do that? Well, there are multiple ways and many people use all of the multiple ways. You can join Alcoholics Anonymous, you can join a support group that doesn't involve Alcoholics Anonymous. You can go to a counselor and receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps you deal with stressors and builds resilience for situations that are going to tempt you to drink. There are some medications that'll help you along the way. The real issue is that your whole life has to change. So, an individual like this will probably have to be supervised for a long time to come by some family member, or loved one, or some group because alcohol is killing them. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
