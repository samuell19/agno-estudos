[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Engine revving] [♪♪♪] Turn off your engine! Where are you coming from? From the factory down the road there, sir. OFFICER #1: Down where? Dacula. The rubber factory, officer. OFFICER #1: What is there? There's nothing, really. Just rubber blocks, officer. OFFICER #1: You say what? Rubber blocks! OFFICER #1: Come down from the motor. But I just told you, it's rubber blocks! OFFICER #1: I said, come down from the motor. - Oya, take him there! - It's rubber blocks, officer. There's nothing there. [Crickets chirping] OFFICER #2: Open it! [Metal rattling] OFFICER #2: Open! [Squeaking] KOSSI: (Narrating) The world is designed to protect children. We are the last pure entity left. - [Phone ringing] - Sorry, sorry, my phone. Hello. Yes. Yes. [Inaudible chatter] [Sighs] KOSSI: (Narrating) But when you are from Gbangbale, Togo... no one gives a flying, running, crawling fuck. 'Cause even parents sell their children away for a few meals around here. Our generation was supposed to stay nothing. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: (Narrating) I was sold to this house, maybe rent... but master did not want me here. There's a civil war going on where that boy just came from. Uh-huh? I'll say we're doing his family a huge favor by taking him in. The boy is from Togo! The only civil war going on in Togo right now darling, is in your head! [Laughs] - But honey... - No, honey. Let the boy go back to where he came from. And that's final. Final? I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. I brought that boy into this house for one reason... to keep this house clean. If his family wanted him around, I'm sure that's where he would be. So stop trying to save the world, and mind your own business. Well, um... my house, so it is kind of my business, no? MRS. MARTINS: Correction! This is OUR house! May I suggest, you send in your notice at work... learn how to cook and clean - [Laughs] - It's called house husbanding! - Ridiculous! - Yes! It's not such a taboo anymore... darling! Thanks, honey! KOSSI: (Narrating) She is the real master. So, I stay. There was this bully from Japan that her brother cannot protect her from. I promised that I will destroy this bully, so she became my best friend. Her name is Oyin. And on the other hand... [Rattling] KOSSI: (Narrating) His name... is Bastard. GAME VOICE: Japan! - [Gaming voices] - [Keys tapping] GAME VOICE: You lose! GAME VOICE: Round 1, fight! [Gaming voices] KOSSI: (Narrating) I forgot to mention that I used to play this game with the missionaries back in Gbangbale. GAME VOICE: You win! Perfect! GAME VOICE: Round 2, fight! KOSSI: (Narrating) It was after this game... master sir told me that my mother died. Oyin helped me plan my escape. I have to go and save my mother's fish. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: (Narrating) So... I stayed. 15 years! I read somewhere that you should never trust a man... Even if that man is your fiancé? Kossi please, I don't want to talk about this anymore. Look! This is why you want to leave. - What will I do? - Plenty! All you have to do is sort out Femi's big head... and you'll have time to spend with Emma Kachi and Muhtar and oh! Maybe you can finally start dating that secret girl you've refused to tell me about. I cannot be with her now. Why not? See, the things men should know about women... men don't have the time to learn And if they have the time, they definitely don't have the money. So, where does that leave someone like me? Kossi! The things that come out of your mouth... amazing. [Phone ringing] [Grunts] - KOSSI: It's Kossi! - Fuck! Come in! - You called me. - I fucking know that. Wash the stain off that. Put some towels by the pool. Hello. [Sighs] My name is Kossi. Okay? Do you want something to drink? FEMI: Hey! Will you get the fuck away from there! You crazy? KOSSI: (Narrating) Emmanuel is from my village... he always dress nice, even in his uniform. His master, the professor likes him like the son he never had. He even taught him how to speak like him. [Chuckles] You know that sometimes where you live... determines if you live. There was no hope for us in Gbangbale! And this is hope? Tell me, Emma. Show me. I should have done everything for them not to bring me into this country... I should have held onto a knife I Should have fought. I shouldn't have done nothing! You're acting as if this is the end of the world. This is not the end of the world. Even the end of the world is not the end of the world! Emma, but it could be the end of me! Well, you're here now... and you're a man. So, what are you going to do about it? Everything! Like what? Leave? Go back to Togo? What?! What the fuck is wrong with you, Emma? Huh?! Togo?! See, the only way I'm going back... is in a private jet and a baggage full of money! So, bye bye Togo. I cannot stay another day as a slave to that shithead! It is time. And first thing tomorrow morning I'm leaving that house for good... My real life starts now! So, what? You leave the house and become homeless? KOSSI: (Narrating) I did not fucking go anywhere... but, I started to make some moves. I was looking for how to make money and I saw the story of a man... who printed $10 million! In his house! With just a computer, printer... a sample of a $100 bill and his brain! I decided to look into this... and I was blown away by the world's money system. You know, printing fake money is one of the oldest crimes in the world. But, what if I told you that the biggest fake-money printer in the world... is actually the government? [Phone ringing] KACHI: House boy! KOSSI: Bloody factory worker. Kachi, see... you remember this paper that I took from you the other time? - What? - That paper. The one I said feels like money. Oh yeah, rag paper. Why? I need some. You can't just get rag paper like that! Kachi, there has to be a way! Yeah, actually there is! Go to the Central Bank of Nigeria, ask the MD to give you some. Look Kossi, I have to go I'm busy. - [Hangs up] - Kachi! KOSSI: (Narrating) The United-States Treasury actually put out a paper telling you the security features to look for in a real dollar. [Kossi laughing] KOSSI: (Narrating) This is like the teacher giving you answers to the exam. [Kossi laughing] KOSSI: (Narrating) But the paper is the foundation of everything... without paper, I have nothing. Only banks and top paper manufacturing companies have the license to produce this paper... and every single sheet must be accounted for. Lucky for me, Kachi works at a printing press... he knew another friend that works for a top paper manufacturing company. He was the only hope. It took a few weeks, but Kachi finally agreed to talk to his friend... and it took his friend another three weeks to get into some money trouble. He finally caved. KACHI: He said when he comes out... we have 10 minutes to do whatever we need to go in and do. And you want me to go in there and steal papers? But you tell me that you have a friend that has papers. Well, when I told you he works here, that is not a lie. Kachi, it's like you telling me that someone is in the film business... and you get to find out that they're just security at the cinema! Well, that puts him in the film business. Kachi... What the actual fuck?! Kossi, time is ticking... The alarm will be coming back on in 10 minutes... so, we either stand here and argue or go in and get the paper for only God knows what you need them for! I don't even know why I'm standing here! I just... KOSSI: (Narrating) For everything else... [Indistinct chattering] KOSSI: (Narrating) The underground dark web of Lagos... perhaps Africa. Here... for a fee fake passports visas of any kind anyone's house papers LPOs Jesus's birth certificate, a baby you get the idea? you can get your hands on anything. Along with the information I found on the government website... I was able to move ahead. I spent many months working on the look of the money. If this is going to work... first thing first, it must look like money. Then, I worked down the list. But of all the security features on any bill... the most powerful test it must go through is the one most people do everyday without even knowing it. When you collect money... your fingers send a secret signal of validation to your brain to put you at ease. This I found... there is no bigger test. EMMANUEL: It feels like Paper. Emma, don't be stupid! Is it a book paper or a magazine paper or what? Book paper! Look, can I open my eyes now? You cut out paper? Why?! You're going crazy, man! KOSSI: (Narrating) Emmanuel was right... I was going crazy. They say practice makes perfect, but this is a lie. Practice makes good. Only obsession makes perfect. My money looks like the real money, but it doesn't feel like it. I tried everything. I raised the ink levels, neutralized the starch even more... I soaked it in different solutions, I put it in the microwave I stored it underground to bake! But every time, my fingers knew that they were not holding money. It was becoming more clear... I had to find another way to make money. In all of this... I hadn't been there for Oyin. She was going through a very difficult time. One year ago... she said yes to marrying this man that I never liked from the first time I saw him. He has proof that him cheating on me was the work of the devil. Today... she will return that ring. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: (Narrating) For the first time in 8 months... my fingers finally sent that secret signal to my brain. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: (Narrating) The secret ingredient that had been missing all along. [♪♪♪] I don't have my glasses on! You don't have your glasses on?! Come in! What the fuck is wrong with you? I thought I told you to clean this place yesterday! You don't have your fucking glasses on?! Yes! What, then somehow you managed to miss that?! Oh! Now, you found your glasses! I did the cleaning myself, it wasn't there. I did not see this. What are you still doing there?! Will you pick that shit up and leave! Where the hell do you think you're going to? I want to go and get a packer. Will you freaking pick that shit up and get the fuck out of here! Hey! Hey! Don't use your hands! You have crocodile hands. I have my own. Me? Fuck you! - I'm just saying. - You hear me? Fuck you! How much is this?! I'm working on something... and I will need you. Actually, I can even get you a room. I already have my own room. With air condition and TV. I'll tell you what... you get me a room, in this city no TV, no air condition, nothing! Just a room. Four walls... I'll move in with you I will cook for you, I will clean for you I will even be your girlfriend. - Fuck you! - [Chuckling] This is not even funny. And you getting a house? Not funny! But, what if I do... Do we have a deal? Yes! We have a deal. [Laughing] I'm getting a room. [Indistinct chattering] ONLOOKER: What did he do? [Inaudible] What did he steal? He tried to exchange fake dollars. - Are you trying to kill him?! - He's a thief! The last time, they put somebody out of seventy thousand... Okay, you need change. Wait, wait. Move him over there! Move him! I'm coming back, now. [Indistinct chattering] [♪♪♪] Take! We don't like thieves around here! Death to any thief I get my hands on! Where is he?! [Man screaming] KOSSI: (Narrating) This is the moment I mentally resigned as a houseboy. I just needed the rest of me to catch up. [♪♪♪] [Knocking] Yes? How are you? Look... if Femi sent you here to apologize for him... No, I didn't come here for anybody. Just me. I know you're wondering... doing on my... uh, on my chair?" But, here's a story... In a very tiny village in Togo... there was this little boy by far, he was the brightest kid they had ever seen. Even the missionaries saw this too! YOVO! That's what we called them. They wanted to take him to Paris... they knew with the right opportunities he was going straight to the top! You want to use my son for witchcraft, isn't it Yovo? Please don't go, come back here, please! KOSSI: (Narrating) But the mother never liked Yovo... they take black people away, they use them for sacrifice and that is why they live all this glorious lives. According to her. [Kossi laughing] You're beautiful. You're a bear, just like me. I'll call you, "Mama Bear". You know, I never liked anyone in my life, before. I'm liking only you. I am a business man, and I'm going to make a lot of money. Very soon. The kind of money that you would like to come around. Mama Bear. I am going to come for you. Hmm. Thank you for your time. One more thing. You forgot this at the house. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: (Narrating) If you are ever interested in meeting real-life clowns... look for any property agent in Lagos. They are from another planet. PROPERTY AGENT: Is it really for you? It's a 'No'? This is one of the two bedrooms... two of them en suite and one is currently being... It's another 'No'? KOSSI: Tell me more about this place. PROPERTY AGENT: It has 3 bedrooms. All en suite, as you can see, this is a great living room space hard to find in an area like this, for the price. The kitchen is spacious. You'll not have to beg your lady before she cooks for you. And in thanking her. Let me show you the master bedroom. What is the final price of this place? If you are serious, I mean ready like right now, KOSSI: (Narrating) At this point... I was making $500 every day! Daddy! MR. MARTINS: This unannounced visit is actually about Kossi. Yes. I suspect that living outside the chaos of city life... has made us to reflect better on life. And on decisions we may have made that err... may not have been for the best. Your father and I... we feel like we've maybe not handled the Kossi situation in the best of ways. The long and short of it is we're releasing him. - Yeah. - Yes. - Releasing him? - Mm-hmm. To what? To go back to Togo and to choose whatever he wants to do with his life. He's a relatively young chap and it's certainly better now as opposed to later. But don't worry, we've hired a proper maid service, hmm. They'll come, cook, clean, take care of the house. What? Does he even know anybody in Togo? Kossi is as Nigerian as anybody that I know! I'm sorry, but this doesn't make sense! Mind your tongue, young lady. Now, we have already considered that... and we have made arrangements to ease his transition. We've already bought him a plane ticket! And we have a severance package of 500,000 Naira! To help him sustain himself until he figures out what he wants to do. And this is why we're having this conversation? Really? I mean, who cares? It's Kossi. He's useless. He smells! Femi! MR. MARTINS: You see what you have raised? - What I raised? - Yes! I raised this one, you raised that one. Dear, let's not start, eh? [♪♪♪] Well, it's been real. Good luck. [♪♪♪] [Sobbing] You have my email and my number. Call me the second you get there. I'm going to miss you so much, Kossi. I love you. [♪♪♪] [Engine starts] CAB DRIVER: So, you're a house boy?! [Laughing] And your face looks like this? You've eaten a pig! Look at him! House boy with pink lips. [Laughing] CAB DRIVER: Where are you traveling to? Won't you answer me?! I asked where you're traveling to! I'm going to Togo. Togo! Togo, Togo, Togo, Togo! You're going to Togo... and you're carrying a refugee bag. [Cab driver laughing] CAB DRIVER: You're traveling out of the country? Like this?! Like this?! No problem. My only concern is to drop you off at the airport. Then they can do with you whatever they like. Help me fix the mirror well! The side mirror, do it! Closer! I want to provoke you to talk! Provoke me? - Talk! - Must we talk?! CAB DRIVER: You must talk! KOSSI: Why?! Because I want you to talk! I'm happy! I provoked him! What is all of this?! What is all of this?! Togo, Togo! Togo, Togo! Can you tell me what the hell is going on?! We've just missed our flight! We left our cab with our bags inside. We didn't miss any flight. We didn't miss any flight. That was not my own flight. You understand. That was not my flight. Taking me back to what?! - Togo! - To Togo?! You want to go back to Togo?! You want to go back to Togo, what do you know about Togo?! See, I'm working on something, right now... and all I need from you is your loyalty and trust. And if all these things is too much for you to carry, you can go back, now! I got us a beautiful place, you will love it. But first... one more stop. KOSSI: (Narrating) Changing $100 bill is one thing... but changing... 10,000! [Chuckles] You're holding big money now, my friend. That's good. Maybe I should go somewhere else. No, no, no, no... See... Even if you go, you'll come back. Our price is the best. I swear to God. Please sit down. Sit down, please. Just one minute. One minute. [♪♪♪] My friend! There's a problem. You see this your dollar... is 1996. This is the recent one. It's always 10 Naira less. I'm saying the truth, ask anybody. It's 10 Naira less. Pleasure doing business with you! KACHI: Kossi, you live here now? KOSSI: This is me... Head of Operations. I am in charge. Emmanuel... this is you. Muhtar... and Kachi you're here. Emmanuel will follow my orders... and you two will follow Emmanuel's orders. The way it is on the board... it is the exact way that it's going to be, but... We are all the same. Hmm? We are all the same. If we do these things very well... we're heading straight to the top! Kachi... You may have to resign, yeah? KACHI: Done! How much are they paying me? I'll resign, too. From what? You don't have a job, Muhtar! I mean, I'll stop looking... Shut up, Muhtar! KOSSI: But first! First thing first... Image! You see all these rags that we are wearing. We have to put them all together and burn them to ashes. Burn everything! We need to look the part. Hmm? Because when people see us... they think we're rich. And when we give them money, they won't even have any reason to think at all. Please... choose your own style. Do not look like anybody. Because you're at your best... when you are yourself, hmm? KOSSI: (Narrating) I saw this place on Mama Bear's phone. So, it must classy. [Indistinct lyrics] [♪♪♪] Ahh! I like everything! [♪♪♪] Excuse me! How much is this bag? Very good choice. It's $5,500 only. - DELIVERY GIRL: Hello! - Hello! We have a delivery for Miss. Sonia Badu. Okay, where's it? We have to see an ID, please. TV VOICE: I really can't keep up! When did stupid become a style? Hey! What's going on, that's my bag! There's a delivery for you. A what? TV VOICE: Man, the only Don you ever had... Delivery! Thank you! - Have a good day, madam. - Thank you! Sonia! Do you mind?! Is Femi in the doghouse? Even if! Ify! I can hear your brain breathe! Oh my God! Did Femi send this? Mama Bear? Papa Bear? You better start talking, Sonia. [Sighs] It's Femi's house boy. [Exclaims] What if he stole it? Did you see how it was delivered? It came straight from the store. He paid for this. But you know... if you don't want it I can just take it. Oh. [♪♪♪] What is this thing? This?! This is champagne! It tastes like water from raw pap. You will like it. KOSSI: You know how all those suicide bombers are supposed to get virgins. when they get to paradise. This is paradise! And you don't have to bomb anybody. Just come to Lagos. KACHI: Yeah. Best part... none of them are virgins. Yeah! Very true. How the fuck you know, man? - Me? - Ha. KOSSI: Not you. I'm talking to your grandfather's spirit. This is the closest you have ever been to any girl, not fully dressed, Muhtar. - Me? - Mhmm. Again... not you. Look at that girl, right there! KOSSI: Muhtar! You wanna go talk to her? EMMANUEL: Go! It's easy! Just tell her what you like about her. - Don't teach me nothing. - Uh. I know what to do! Pay attention! Shabba! Hello, how are you? Hello... [Laughter] KOSSI: (Narrating) And as we were having the time of our lives... this was happening on the other side of town. That came in this morning. What's the trail on this? CAPTAIN: None. They're that good. TOYE: But, the machine didn't pick up anything? That's your problem now, detective. Let me know what you find. I'm leading this? At some point, a man has to lose his virginity. And I do not see you wearing a white collar, so... yes, your first lead. Thank you, mam. KOSSI: (Narrating) The good counterfeit will pass from person to person and stores to stores. They usually don't get noticed until they reach the bank. Now, the bank has agencies that will compare the notes for tendencies, so they can trace where the fake is coming from. That's where these guys come in. The first step is usually a shakedown of the usual suspects. My bill was so good, it took them completely off track. Thinking it must be coming from the guys at the top. TOYE: Yeah! The regular. Money laundering. KOSSI: (Narrating) Detective Toye... he's a brilliant, but troubled man. She gave me the ring back. Now, she's talking about going to grad school in America. I mean, I make one mistake, one mistake! She calls off the engagement?! KOSSI: (Narrating) This investigation is not the only headache for Detective Toye... His personal life is also going through some rocks. [♪♪♪] Kachi, what is this? What is the mean... Listen! See, Muhtar! Look, all it takes... for this ship to wreck, burn and sink is one single faulty bill. Just one! So if you're cutting, make sure it's a perfect cut. And if you are pasting, make sure it is a flawless paste. very strip straight, please! Because, you cannot defend a fake out there... but a perfect copy, you can fight for! TOYE: I can't believe you're leaving so soon. Leaving me here all alone. OYIN: Are you sure about that? [Clears throat] So... How's the ticket? Expensive. You know, I have a bonus coming in soon. That should be able to take care of that. You don't have to do that. I know I don't have to, but I want to. I want it to be my responsibility. Again. See, Oyin it's just... Whose is this? What is it? It's a printed $100 bill. Really? I don't know. Oh! It's probably for Kossi. He has an obsession with printing junk. God, I miss him. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: Mr. Abu! You are ready for the business, aye? Hey! Come, let's go! Come, let's go! Come on. KOSSI: Abu, what is... What is going on?! - KOSSI: Abu! - Come on. How much is this? 50,000. Where did you get this money? I don't know what this has to do with you. The last time you came... you changed $10,000. Now, you've come back. $50,000. What kind of business do you do? Where is your office? I swear to God! We don't like thieves around here! Who's the thief? You talk... or we make you talk. It's up to you. I will tell you everything that you want to know. Hmm. I was a house boy in Abuja, for Mustafi. The former Governor? [♪♪♪] I want five Naira off the market price. My friend, 15 Naira. This dollar, is old dollar. No, Shagari, you have not impressed me at all. You have not. I want 10! Plus delivery service. I call you... I tell you where the dollar is, you send the money to me. Deal? My friend, no problem. No problem. You can change big dollars? Come on! Everybody comes to me! One million dollars, two million dollars, no problem. No problem. I have way more than that. My very good friend! God brought you to me! Shagari! SHAGARI: My very good friend! [♪♪♪] Hello Hammed... I need you to call Johnson, over at immigration. Have him run a flight check on a Kossi. K-O-S-S-I As in Singapore, India. Get everything you can in the last two months. I'm on my way to the office. [♪♪♪] Babe, uhm... It's not what you think. I can explain this. She, uhm... just came around to say hello, and uhm... Okay, please! Just sit down. Hear me out! Just sit for a second, please. Oh, fuck! You didn't even ask any questions. You just walked in and... SONIA: What the fuck are you talking about, Femi?! I saw you kissing and doing shit with some fucking whore! Babe... are you going to believe your eyes or what you think you saw or are you going to trust me on this one? [♪♪♪] HAMMED: We had 109 Kossi's depart in the last two months. Hold that thought. Do you think those two came from the same source? At the least, it can't be ruled out. TOYE: All right. Let's get a road manifest for the same period. Okay. You know, detective... looking at the manifest by road, we could be talking about over 2,000 names. And your point is? That's a whole lot of names. You have to treat every crime like the crime of the century. You know why? Because you never know what you'll find. Frankly, I don't care if it's a million names. Go get them. [♪♪♪] [Knocking on door] FEMI: Sonia, please. [Music playing in background] [Taking deep breaths] You know what... you've got 10 seconds to open this door. If you don't, I'll leave and that's it! Will you fucking open this door! 10! 9! Open the door! Open the fucking door! Babe, don't worry about this. He'll be gone in 60 seconds and we can go to the club and have some fun. Okay? KOSSI: Look at all these girls here, tonight! Kossi, we should live here! You're gonna get slapped again, yeah? [Cheering and laughing] MUHTAR: It's the pap water, again! This is because we're celebrating! Today, our business took a turn for the moon! The moon! I am ready to enjoy this journey. To a ton of money! TOGETHER: To a ton of money! [Laughter] [♪♪♪] Oh my God! What, what, what is it? [♪♪♪] KOSSI: Mama Bear! Oh, hi! Hello. How are you? Fine, thank you. Is that your friend? Yes, this is Ify. Oh. Ify. KACHI: Kossi! You know, I was calling your number and... you did not pick, so, I thought I... had a wrong number. - Yeah, maybe. - Oh. [Nervous laugh] See... I'm over there. At the VIP. You wanna come? So we can talk. Can I think about it? Yeah, sure, sure! - Sure. - Okay. Take your time. Take your time. 20 seconds... 30 seconds... Any time, just take it, yeah! Okay. [Clears throat] Excuse me. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] This is Mama Bear! So, these are my people, yeah. Is everything okay? Um, I never got to thank you for the bag. Ah, oh yeah? Do you like it? It's gorgeous! But... I'll have to give it back. Oh, yeah. KOSSI: (Narrating) It was clear that she just wanted to make him jealous. But, you know what they say... "Opportunity favors the prepared man." I have money now. I mean, that shirt cost me 1,800 real dollars. That's $100 more than my perfume. The people at The Polo Avenue promised it will catch me a big fish. Now, Sonia? She is a mermaid! Are you sure you really want to return this bag? - Hmm? - Um-hmm. Hmm. But, First thing first... this bag is not empty. Empty. Open it. No! Open this bag, now! Or I'll be forced... to use force. What's stopping you? Hmm. [♪♪♪] [Birds squawking] Aye! I'm in company of bad boys! Bad boys! Last night was the greatest night of my life! And you just missed her. - Is this boy lying or what? - Don't ask me. [Laughing] Who was that? The girl from where we changed the money. I pulled her in! KOSSI: Are you fucking serious? How the fuck do you not use your head? - Relax, man. - Huh? Do you know what you have done? You just brought your shit to the eating table, man. That girl probably can't find her way anywhere. - She can't even see! - What?! KOSSI: Kachi! So what you're telling me now, is after all this money... you cannot even get a fucking hotel? So, I have to stay in my own house... worrying about Shagari invading my space with 1,000 swordsmen? - You tell me! - [Kachi exhales] EMMANUEL: You know what we need? I'm telling you, I trust my instincts. So you want me to arrest a guy because you think he's a criminal? I know what I saw! Whatever it is, it has to be illegal! What's going on? Femi here wants me to arrest a guy because, the guy disrespected him in the club last night. The fuck?! That's not it. I'm sorry, I'm wrong. The guy also spent an obscene amount of money, which he thinks is illegal money. Go take a nap, you look a mess. Whatever happened in that club, I'm sure you caused it. I caused it, really? Our houseboy, spending money, buying bottles of champagne at the club! Putting moves on my girlfriend right in front of my face, and... - It's my fault?! - Wait! Kossi?! Tipping the bouncer $100 to assault me and carry me out of the club! - And that is my fault?! - Wait, wait, wait, hold on... $100 bills? Do you have a description of this bouncer? ROCKY: How can I help you? We're working on something right now, and... - we need protection. - You know? We need you around the clock. Do you have any special skill for that kind of job? CLUB BOUNCER: Hey, Rocky! Some people here to see you! I'm coming. Give me one minute. TOYE: We're detectives from the Special financial crimes unit. I'm Toye, and this is my partner, Hammed. Uh, how can I help you? We are in pursuit of a guy called Kossi. We learned that he was here, in your club, last night. We also learned that he... gave you a tip. Dollars. The club is always dark. I'd like to remind you... lying to an officer is a crime, with serious consequence. Officer, I get tips every night. It's nothing. Mind if I have a look at the money? I exchanged it, already. Where? Or do you remember who changed it for you? Well, the window was crowded, and... [♪♪♪] Where did you change the money? I will triple your salary, if you can work for us... starting from now. [♪♪♪] ABUBAKAR: Which one, is it dollar or pounds? TOYE: Have you seen this guy? What did he do? My friend. This guy is flooding the streets with high quality counterfeit. Dollars! TOYE: Look well. No, no. Are you sure? Yes, sure. I've never seen him. If you ever see him... you give me a call. [Phone ringing] KOSSI: Hello, Abubakar! You need what? One million dollars. One million dollars? You're serious? You have the cash? I have the cash... right here with me. KOSSI: Okay. How about Friday? Friday is good. KOSSI: No problem. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Abubakar. TOGETHER: One million dollars! Yeah, baby! Have you heard from your house boy? I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Have you heard from Kossi? Since he left? Not even one phone call? Alright, fine, if he calls you... you have to call me immediately, okay please? He's a criminal, in a world of trouble, baby. [Chuckles] [♪♪♪] Kossi, what are you still doing here? Making money. What do you do? I make money. I heard you. How? I print my own money. Kossi! I know. You know, anyone can be a monster. Except you. [Phone ringing] Um listen, can I call you back? Not that it's any of your business, but I'm having dinner with a friend. Okay, bye. Listen, Kossi, that was Toye on the phone, he's been looking for you everywhere. Kossi, you're in really big trouble. Does he know that I'm here? No, no, of course not. Listen... you need to be really careful. Toye, he has a lot of resources at the agency, and sooner or later they will find you. I have to go. Please, call me. [♪♪♪] SONIA: I think we actually need to take things slow. This is all too strange for me. It wasn't strange the other night. I had too much champagne! In wine, there's always the real truth. If you don't believe me... Then, let us drink again. [Phone ringing] Emma... What is it? Don't you think you should be here? So I can hold your hand or something? This money is stacking up fast. We need to get everything done by tomorrow. Are you telling me after all this time... you don't know what to do? I'm just saying that... I don't know what you have going on, that's more important than what we have going on. Don't worry. I'll see you soon. [♪♪♪] Let us go away... to somewhere new, you know. Beautiful. Quiet. And I have a deal tomorrow. After then... you won't have to worry about anything. For sure not money. Mama Bear. [♪♪♪] Hey, look! That's the bastard! [♪♪♪] [Knock on door] Good morning, boss. But, you people are aware that we have neighbors everywhere. Huh? What is this? The first person step in here, they see all of these things. So, you're telling me that there's no locker, or safe or something, to put all these things in? Rocky is at the door. Nobody can enter this place. And we don't even talk to anyone here! Emmanuel... I don't want all these things here. EMMANUEL: What do you want me to do? You have to check the money before it can enter the safe. You're asking me what to do? Emmanuel! What do I want you to do? Oh, okay! How about you take all the money... take everything! Put them together... stack them then put them outside. Now, get a sign post and write... "Money Printing Shop". How about that? Put these things away! What... what... what is this? Put this in the locker, locker is over there! Tell me why am I looking at a report about counterfeit money machine seizures... and I haven't got one single report from you?! Maybe I shouldn't have assigned you lead on this case. I do not think you're ready! See me in my office, now! [♪♪♪] CAPTAIN: [Inaudible speech] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [Clears throat] Hey, baby. I came here for... two things. The other day you called me... I lied that I was with a friend, but... I was with Kossi. He confessed. You love him like a brother. I expected you'd cover up for him. Well, I don't know who this Kossi is. Besides... if WE are going to be spending the rest of our lives together, I... I need to be sure what side I'm on. I have an arrest warrant... being processed. He's going down Friday night. Hmm. Thank God. I... bought my ticket. I leave on Friday night. [♪♪♪] Hot off the press! What is going on? Listen, you need to get out of here! Out of Lagos. Out of Nigeria. Please! - What do you mean? - Toye has a warrant! The bastard is going down, tonight! - But you are leaving tonight? - Kossi! Are you listening to me, you need to get out! - Where will I go?! - I don't know! Listen, I've been thinking... do you have enough money to charter a plane? I think I have enough to even buy a small one. Great! I will send you the details. Kossi! Toye will stop at nothing! Assemble the team! I need this wrapped up, quick. Copy that! Alright, go. Just go. Kossi! You're fucking Sonia?! I always knew you were baddass! [♪♪♪] EMMANUEL: 960... 970... 980... 990... 1 million. [♪♪♪] KOSSI: Go and get Rocky outside. All the laptops, ink, paper, clips, everything... Clear this whole house, now. Hmm. Where are we going to? I don't know. My dear, the account is now fully operational. There's about $10,000 in it, right now. I love you, daddy! MRS. MARTINS: Isn't there something else... Oh, yeah! Umm... Oyin... Mom, dad, I love you. I'll have to call you when I get to the airport. - Okay, bye! - Oyin! Kossi! Where have you been?! Larry has been calling me, they're about to give the plane to someone else! KOSSI: I just need to make one more stop. Okay, well... there's no time, alright. It's $15,000, or you can pay in Naira. Do you have the money? KOSSI: Yeah, I have the money. Okay, so I need you to go to the airport, straight away. I've text you the details. He's expecting you. KOSSI: Okay, but I will have to go home, first. No, no, no! Kossi, listen to me... you cannot go home. Toye is either at your house, or on his way there... do not go home! Do not fucking go home! [♪♪♪] My good friend! - How are you? - Fine! - You have the stuff? - Yeah, I have it in the car. Do you have the money? Hey! Bring it, quick! 350 million Naira, right inside here. KOSSI: Give me one second. One million... dollars, eh. Your request. Uh, that's good. Everything is okay. But, just to be sure, mhmm. I want to test the dollar. To be sure it's real. But, I told you the story about the money. It's not about the story, my friend. This is reality. I'll drop a liquid on it... If the dollar is real... everything goes fine. But, if the dollar is fake, eh, it turns black. Will it turn black? Give me liquid! Will it turn black? [♪♪♪] One time, my friend... two times, my friend... will it turn black? [♪♪♪] My good friend. I... - My friend! - What? It turned black! You want to scam me of 350 million Naira?! Get him! Put him in the car! Throw him inside! I'll show you how we deal with thieves! [Indistinct yelling] [♪♪♪] HAMMED: What do we do? [♪♪♪] [Groaning] [Panting] SHAGARI: Thief! I told you, I don't like thieves. You've stolen a lot of my money. You can take anything else... my wife, my children... they reduce my money, too. But, when you steal my money?! What I do to you... your hand will never be able to hold money, again. [Kossi grunting and coughing] [♪♪♪] Hello! Fatima... don't do that. I know you've been trying to call me. I'll explain everything, when I see you. Can I see you? Fatima! FATIMA: I've missed you. I miss you, too! So much that, I want to see you. Next week. When we get back on land. On land? Where are you? We're at the beach house, in Satellite. So, you think some ocean will keep me from seeing you? [Boat engine revving] [♪♪♪] [Grunting] There were other five house boys there. And only two of us knew where the money room is... we knew the police were coming. And we packed as much as we could, and I came to Lagos. [Groaning and panting] [Screaming] [♪♪♪] [Grunting] [Screaming] ABUBAKAR: Hold him, tight! [Birds chirping] [Indistinct lyrics] - [Gunshot] - [Grunting] Stop the music! Stop the music! Did I hear something? Sorry, sorry, sorry, I must be getting old! You're angry? Don't be angry. Continue! Shhh! One word and I'll blow your head off! Where are you keeping him? Get in, get in, get in. - [Gunshot] - [Groaning] [Labored breathing] - [Gunshot] - [Groaning] [Knocking] Untie him. Where's the money? Huh? - [Gunshot] - [Groaning] - [Gunshot] - [Groaning] [Kossi groaning] [Laughter] Tonight there's no sleep. [Indistinct talking] ABUBAKAR: Hey! Hey! I swear, this is war! [♪♪♪] Come! There's a fucking problem! Come now! What's happening? [Birds chirping] [♪♪♪] [Indistinct yelling] [Gun firing] ROCKY: Get back! Back! Back! FATIMA: Kachi! Fati! Fatima! [Indistinct] TOYE: You know you don't have to go, right? Besides, if you leave, how am I supposed to survive? I've been thinking about this, long and hard... kinda like my, you know... Sorry. December 384 Kossi? TOYE: So, Oyindamola... Abake... Martins. I've decided that my world revolves around you. Your happiness will be my daily responsibility. If you agree to marry me... again... I will dedicate my whole... [♪♪♪] [Beeping] Excuse me! You need to open that door, I need to get through. Do you have a reservation? Relax... I'm a detective with the special financial crimes unit. There's a man about to board that plane, I need to stop him! That still doesn't give you access to the tarmac! I'm sure it's him! A 100% sure it's him! The EAU Hanger. Please, the order has to come in, right now! [♪♪♪] Excuse... Everybody, hands up! What the hell is going on? [Phone ringing] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
