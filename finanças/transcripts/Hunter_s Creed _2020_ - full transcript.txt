So, can I ask? Why? Why do you believe this has happened? Again, speculating? God becomes God when you need him - and they need God right now. - Help! No! Fast in those heels That's right. Oh, David, look! Oh, I'd like to get in the range of her 12 point daddy I seen wander around here a month ago. - Are you kidding me? - What? You see something that beautiful and the first thing you think about is hunting him? - Yeah. - Uh-uh, come here. Oh, don't do,. Go on, look at her. Doesn't she look beautiful? She looks delicious. You are awful. I'll never hunt again. - You promise? - No. Gimme this. I'm not sure how anyone can deny there's a God if nature is this beautiful. You know, I kinda like you, Mrs. David Bryant. Hm, well I kinda like you too, - Oh? - Mr. Kate Bryant. No! What are you doing in here? I told you to wait in the bedroom! - Ooh, what's that? - No, nothing. None of your business. - Honey, - Goodbye please. I got you this little thing and I couldn't wait. You want me to open that now? It is Christmas, eve. - Oh my gosh! - Put it on, I want to see. I had it made at Crystal's. It is beautiful. - Let me see. - Aww. Okay, now it's my turn. Absolutely not, you get outta here right now! Oh, if that's not a new bow, Christmas is ruined! Oh ho, you'll just have to see, huh? - Y'all set? - I am ready. Ooh, let's do it! Hey there Hunters and Huntettes and welcome back to another special behind-the-scenes look at our upcoming hunting show, "Buck Fever Addicts." Now, as most of y'all know, we're still trying to figure out what we want this show to be but because my mama goes to church with our extra special surprise guest , we have the incredible blessing to be able to sit down with somebody who knows a thing or two about reality TV and working with family and praying on camera. So, without further ado, I am so happy to introduce the one, the only, - Dog the Bounty Hunter. - Dog the Bounty Hunter. Please tell these nice people what we're doing here today. Well, we are here to ambush your husband, I mean, surprise your husband. How many times has he watched every show? - Like seven times. - So, he must be one of my biggest fans and seven is God's lucky number. So, let's hide - and ambush Mr. Husband. - Yes! All right, come on! - Too fast. - No, you better not peek or I'll ninja chop you in the neck. - Oh. - Okay, come here. Stay right there, stop. All right, now you just gotta answer one question. What? What is your favorite TV show? What? - Dog the Bounty Hunter? - Yeah. - Hey, hey, hey. - Yeah brother, - hey, hey. - Hey. How are you? I'm good, I'm great, I'm great, I'm great. - Why is he here? - Surprise! So, your wife told me that you're trying - to write your own TV show. - Yes, yes. So, I came all this way to give you a couple hints. Shake my hand, relax son. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. - You got any coffee? - Yes, we have coffee, - do we have coffee? - We have coffee. So brother, do you guys have a sizzle reel done yet? No, Kate is actually in charge of all that. Oh Kate, you gonna show him how to shoot also? Oh no sir. The only shooting I do is from behind this camera. Yeah, she would shoot me before she shot any deers. - No. - So, you get your sizzle reel ready, you sit down with the executives from networks at a big long table, they look at it and then they're gonna say, "Do you guys have a pilot yet?" Or, "let's shoot a pilot." And you're gonna say, "we've already got one." I love your idea of truth and your concept of the number one hunting show, God and family. That's perfect, you've got a great combination. Do you have any children? - No, - Well, are our parents gonna see this? We can just cut it out or not show 'em. Okay, well, we just started trying. So, we just haven't told anybody yet. - Yeah. - Oh well, good luck. - Thank you. - Thank you, yeah. You're the first to know. So, when you're done brother, with your pilot, share it with me because I've got some friends in high places and I feel like I love ya and I feel like I owe it to you. So, you know, - hey, every dog has his day, - All right. Tomorrow's mine - and yours. - All right! - Oh my goodness! - Yeah, let's do this. Oh my God, thank you. Every dog has his day and today we're making a pilot. - We are making a pilot! - Yeah, a pilot. Oh no! Do not film me right now, I look terrible. Oh, you look beautiful - no matter what. - Oh no. I have a secret to tell you. Your mom looks gorgeous with makeup. - No. - Mm-hmm. But, but, but, but, without makeup, your mom looks gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. If we get our little baby girl, what do you think she's gonna look like? Hey baby girl, what're you gonna look like? Please ma'am, I'm trying to have a conversation. - Oh, pardon me. - Go on. Mm-hmm, well, she says that she's gonna be just as beautiful as her mama, eyes, same hair and she says she's gonna love all little baby animals more than her mama. - That's a tall order. - I know. What if it's a little boy? No, that's daddy's baby girl, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, I have some difficult news. Dave is on his way up here and I found this bad boy in the lobby downstairs. So, I just had to have it. And, what good is a squirt gun if you can't use it? So today, Mr. Hunter becomes the hunted. Ooh, look out son! Stop, stop! - Oh, - Got in my eye. - Sorry. - It's fine. Hey. Hey babe, come on, come pray with me. Dear God, thank you for your love and faithfulness, thank you for giving us the ability to love others. Thank you for my husband and for all of our amazing time that we have. Hey, hey baby,. Is there a nurse? Can I get a nurse? Hey guys, I just heard the news and I'm very sorry. As you both know, I just went through this. So, I think that my recommendations and my advice this time could be real. Dave, please love her all the time, keep her close to you, please do the show. That helped my Bethie so much to be able to work and to laugh and to play. I heard that you said you had the symptoms of this disease, that's a start. You know the bible says that life and death are in the power of the tongue, that the most unruly member of the body is the tongue. So please, watch what you both say. Dave, love her, kiss her, hug her, whatever she wants get her. Kate, I love you very much, you have a great husband and I hope you still plan on another member of the family. So, from me to you both, I love you, I feel especially connected to both of you again now. You need anything at all, let me know. I hope to see you both very soon and as I say, aloha. I'm not sure when you're gonna see this. But I just wanted to let you know, I love you so much. God gave me a miracle when I met you. And I'm so sorry, so sorry. Oh,. I was scared, David. More scared than I have ever been. And I know you're scared too. But he's gonna take care of everything. He's my light, even in the darkest times. Oh, I am gonna miss you. But I will see you again soon,. Come on, Dave! Let's go! Whoo. - There he is folks. - Back up, back up. It's darn good to see you man. Hey Russell. Oh, look at that. Got the old trusty elite, huh?

Look at that! Aw man, I bet he gets a catfish. I bet he gets a good old dinner. All right, well welcome to "Buck Fever Addicts." I wanted to name the show "Russell's Muscles and Bucks" but the team done shot that down right away. Now, our show follows four bowmen, myself included, on the hunt for some good old white tail. Now, this episode, we are in the Midwest on an amazing property, hasn't been hunted in years. Welcome to the beginning of our story. Now, let's get hunting. All right, now let me take another one, yeah? No, that was good, that was great. You have to talk about the entire history - of the property, man. - What? No man, I don't want any of that any of that demonic crap in the show. What are you guys talking about? When Paul and I first scouted the place, we talked to the property owner and she said that it used to be run by this religious cult, right? And they used to do like sacrifices and rituals, like full on Satan worshiping, you know? - That kind of thing. - Naw, that's bull crap. No, it's true man, ask Paul when we get up there. Okay and then God came down, got rid of them for their evil deeds and then blessed the property so that nobody could ever do evil there again, the end. Can't have heaven without hell, brother. Both got to exist. Or neither. You all good back there, Sean? Just drive slow. How's it look on camera? - Secluded. - You'd best not scratch my roof with that camera. What is that? You're messing with us. No man, I'm not sure what that is. So, just pull off to the left here. All right, listen, we set up all four deer stands on different points of the property, this place is huge. We're not even gonna be in shouting distance of each other. Great, I've heard this guy talk enough. Few hours of my life I ain't getting back listening to you. Wow. Hello. Anybody home? Coming in. Whoo! Hey Sean, where's the light switch at? Right inside, on the right. Let there be light, woo hoo! Okay folks, this here is a hunting cabin if there ever was one! We got raccoons sticking out of the wall, we got racks, we got bedtime stories over the fireplace. We got a foxy lady over here, it's a bear. This must be the kitchen. Okay, this can work. I'm Chef Russ the Bus and this is my prep chef, Stinky. Stinky and I are gonna bring you some of the mighty fine southern cooking that I grew up with but we're gonna keep in skunk-spense! This here is Bucky the Buck, that's his best friend over there, Trouty the Trout and this here is Pine Lake Resort's finest water, watch out for the lead content. It's upwards of 15%. - And what is this? - Television. That's a TV. Oh, and here on our hunting trips, time just seems to fly. Hey! - Get the door. - Okay, I nearly soiled myself, gimme a second, you coulda knocked. That was my knock, turkey lips. Chicken giblet. Ladies and gentlemen, our God of Fire for the week. Don't play around. Hey, Russell, get the lights for me. - No! - Russell, get the lights - for me, please. - Okay, but if you give me nightmares, I'm gonna sic my mother on you. And behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to them in the blazing fire of a bush. Mom, Sean is gonna give me nightmares, would you please tell him to shut up? All right, that's it. One more thing and we're done. He's gonna get me, he's gonna get me! Cabin B roll, take one. Let's try that again. Can I help you? Are you lost? We rented the cabin for the week, my friends and I were just on a hunting trip. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Hey, Shooter. You scared the crap outta me! Oh man, it's good to see you again, brother. Oh, it's good to see you too. How's the wife? She's good, she was asking about you again on Sunday. I've been at, work's been so crazy, I'm sorry. - It's, we lost a guy, - Hey, don't worry about it. Look, are you ready to have a great week? - Yeah. - Good. - All right. - Come on man, let's get inside. What are you gonna do with that flare? That works. All right so, there he is, buck naked, running down the street with his hands in front of his unmentionables, I pull up behind him. It's raining out, he's soaking wet and I shine the spotlight on him. All right, he turns around - and I'm like, "Billy Swanson?" - No. - No. - Pastor Swanson's son? - No way! - On a stupid dare, his wrestling buddies put him up to it. Course, the poor kid didn't realize that his confirmation leader was going to be the one to catch him. But you shoulda seen the look of terror in his eyes when he turned around and saw me. - Darn pastor kids, man. - Yeah, yeah, all right, so I figure, this boy needs a lesson, right? Oh no, come on! Poor kid, man. You remember those Paul lessons? - I remember the Paul lessons. - Yep. Well, you know, kids these days, sometimes they need a push in the right direction. Some adults do too for that matter. - Yep. - So, what'd you do to him? For him, my friend, for him. Take him back to the farm, I pull him out of the car and I handcuff him to the children's play set. Oh, man. And look, you better not show this footage to anyone, all right? You did not handcuff him to the play set. So, it's like 50 degrees outside, all right? So what do I do? I pull out the garden hose. You can't hose down naked boys in your backyard. - The kid started crying! - Are you crazy? I told him, "hey, you pray on this all night long. "And just maybe you'll catch the Lord's forgiveness." - Well, did he? - Miracle. I let him go early that morning, the boy's flown straight as an arrow ever since. Pauly boy, we, you, me, walk different paths sometimes. I opt for the Coke and conversation. - Hey. - You, It worked didn't it? Sometimes people need a push. Well, gentlemen, I do believe it's time to officially separate ourselves from the world. - No, no! - Yes, yes it is. - Get 'em out. - Just kidding. Disconnection. All right, Seany. Farewell poop emoji, smell ya later. You ready to spend some time out in these beautiful woods? Ready to make some magic happen. Well, gentlemen, that is why we are here. - Amen to that, brother. - Cheers. Amen. Here we go, cut the light. All right, now, as is tradition for us here at "Buck Fever Addicts," the first to sleep on the first night is the first prey of the trip. Old Davey boy here forgot that , shh. Oh! Here we go. Shh. Hey! Y'all want to be grounded? Sorry Paulie boy. - Y'all ready? - Just getting older. Yeah, I'm coming. Here comes the bow, pretty in camo, here comes the bow, he will kill a bow, ho, ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas fellas,. Now, let me tell you something, I want to introduce you to someone. I want you to be kind and supportive, okay? Now, this here quiver, is the brand new, Hoyt Defiant Turbo. 33 inches, axle-to-axle, six inch brace height, 350 FPF, 75% let-off. 4.2 ounces of utter, lethal, instant buck death. You can kiss her, - if you want. - No. The girl that was under the desk with her said the shooter said "peek-a-boo." Nothing to do with any questions or her praying or anything. No, the newspaper said that the guy came up and asked her the question. Why else would the mother write a book called "She Said Yes," if that didn't happen? Guys, wait up, I got a shot. But there was another girl that was in the library and they were saying the witnesses could have mixed up their stories, - which happens all the time. - It's a load of crap and you know it, man. The girl was face-to-face with her own death and she chose to pray. - That's all I'm saying. - You're saying it like the prayers did anything when they didn't, her prayers did nothing for her. Look at this. Old Paul's got the senses of a hound dog. What you got there, brother? We got two bucks about 300 yards down. Look at the size of these guys. Now, the rut happens the first couple weeks in November. And what they're doing is either fighting over some territory or over a doe. Oh, he got 99 problems but a doe ain't one. Oh! - Straight in the neck. - Nice shot. Oh yeah, good one there mate. Let's take a look over here. Oh, look at this! Wow, what do we got over here, sonny boy? What is the worst part about going hunting? Taking a crap in the woods, huh? Hanging and skinning the deer. Thank you, I didn't like any of the hoists that I saw online, so I went ahead and knocked up something myself. This way we don't have to go breaking our backs. ♪ He came in like a wrecking ball! ♪ All right Davey boy, - it's your shot, brother. - All right. Look at him, setting up for the big shot here. Silence. Oh hang on now, shooter, that's recurve bow range. Why don't you show us what you got? All right, it's been a while. Time cannot erase what you know. You know, I think old Davey boy here just needs to a do a little soul searching, remind himself how good he really is. Maybe I'm just out of practice. No, I don't believe that for a minute. Come on, now. Practice makes perfect. Dave weren't you supposed to put your weight on your other foot? Has it been that long? Steve, Perry. - Nice shot. - Right in the center! Yeah, that's pretty good but the Dave I used to know, well, he could hit a quarter across the old campground archery range. Aw. Man, that was the craziest thing I ever seen in my life, how 'bout it Seany boy? I bet you one American dollar, you see that fan right down yonder? - Yeah. - One American dollar says you can't hit it from here. That's 90 yards, that's not gonna be, One American dollar says you can! Did we or did we not call you Shooter? You are holding the bow backwards, man. You gotta turn it around, Dave, you're gonna hurt yourself. Turn it around. - Chucked it, come on, man! - I knew it. I'm gonna have to sell my boat, we keep betting on you. Double or nothing, try it again. Gambling commission gonna come down on us. Strong shooter, I know you're in there somewhere, let's see it. Shooter, shooter, shooter! All right, we're ready to go hunting now, folks! We'll see you bright and early. All right, look, we used to wear something like this in the service, you'll get used to it. - All right. - Good morning. - Morning. - So Shooter, why don't you tell the kids at home what you're suiting up with. Well, as you can see, I don't go out to my spot in my full camo, if you sweat a lot like I do, and I do, I don't 'cause white tails can smell human perspiration from about a mile away. So, I keep cool until I get there. All right, over here, I have my trusty bow, we've been through a lot together. Right here is a scent killer spray, it eliminates odor throughout the day. Don't go hunting without it folks. These are my snacks in my pack. This is a hunting blade, in the pack. This is a range finder, it's used to gauge the distance between your stand and the trees that are around you so that you can know how far the deer are from you. The woods can mess with your distance and depth perception. So, that's what it's for. - That's it for me. - Very nice. What about you, old man? Oh, well I guess in the end, the only piece of equipment that really matters, this thing of beauty right here. All right, so, just record what you can. Try and get some footage on your way out of the site. Just a few minutes here and there. Save the bulk of it when you actually get to the stand or the blind. Do your best to get some good footage, all right? Like, we want to give our audience the best appeal we can. All right, so we got four blinds set up on this lovely property. We have North, East, South and West. What we're gonna do is we're gonna trade off after each hunt and get some bragging rights for who can hunt where the best, all right? Nothing like a little competition. - How 'bout a little wager? - One American dollar? - One American dollar. - One American dollar. All right, Shauny, you are starting on the North line, - Cool. - Russell, we are sending you down the South side. I am taking the East blind which leaves Dave with the wicked witch of the west. By the way, Dave, you get any footage of those satanic cultists out there? Try and make it a nice clean shot, all right? And, by the way, God please rebuke Sean for being an idiot and save us from evil, amen. - Amen. - Amen. - All right. - Let's do it. - Let's get those bucks. - Oh, by the way, Dave, ain't nothing in them woods you can't kill with that bow. It is a whole new ball game trying to find your stand when you can barely see anything. Even in the daylight, the woods can be confusing. A good practice is to mark your stands, reflector tape. Mark your route if you can. If not, use landmarks. It's all about landmarks, folks. We should be close. Very funny, guys. Got my candy. Candy is a must for me. I unwrap ahead of time, put it in a napkin or a cloth, no sound. The other guys like to eat last year's jerky as good luck. Way I see it, some deer smelling its own dead isn't too inviting. So, candy is dandy. It is beautiful. That's the best part about hunting, if you ask me. It's the quiet. Oh man, look at that. Oh, they're beautiful. We've got one, two, three, four. Not a bad day one. No bucks yet. No hunting ground is alike, between weather, terrain, other hunters in the area. All this affects the hunting ground. It can change how things happen. - Oh, hey, you okay brother? - Yeah, I'm fine. Hey man, brother seriously. Out here in the woods this morning, I didn't have any TP. Is that poop? Is that poop? Hey, yo! Could hear you boys a mile away. No, not me. Must be Daffy Duck over here. I made him wet his britches. That true, Dave? Yes. What do you got there, wise Gandalf? I got us some snacks. As you saw, they're easy to clean and their hides can be used for any number of things. I mean, my kids like it when I bring 'em back some fresh rabbit feet for them for good luck. One rabbit is a good meal for one, it's a light meal for two. So, this is a pretty good haul for a few of us. Russell's gonna cook 'em up real good. Hey there, welcome to Buck Fever Feasts. Now, as always, I will be your chef today, Chef Russ the Bus. These are the lucky rascals that get to enjoy what I got cooking today. Now, you've got your grill of goodness, you got your seasoning, I like to use lots of salt and Tabasco to spice things up for these boys a little bit. Now, on the menu today is Russell's famous eggs with my secret ingredient. - Eggs. - Yeah, well, anyways you got your eggs. You got your Russell's Testament Toast, you got your Russell's Heavenly Hashbrowns, you got your Russell's Let He Who Has Not Sinned Cast the First Stone Bacon, you got your Russell's sin free sausage. You got your Russell's Holy Ham. You got your Grammy's Special, Glorified Grits, mm. You are literally the only person eating those grits today, man. Yeah well, y'all are missing out. Judas juice, Mary's milk. Well, that's about 500 million bajillion calories of hunting feast right there. Come on, join us. - That looks good though. - Yeah, looks great. Like everyone have a good hunt this morning - or set, I should say. - Not a set, didn't even see a squirrel. - Oh yeah. - Did you guys hear anything weird out there though? - Like what? - Oh right, that looks good. Like a loud screeching sound, some kind of animal. Like a bobcat? - This was not a cat. - I didn't hear anything. - You sure? - Well, if you're interested, I happen to know of someone, - personally, - Good job. That can take your fear away from you for the rest of your life. It's just, I'm surprised your wrist doesn't hurt more with all the bible thumping you do. - Here you go. - Truth is truth, man. - Okay. - Truth be told, I'm not at all surprised that you're hearing weird sounds in the woods. It just kinda comes with the territory, - you know what I mean? - Hey man, can you pass that stuff over before we start eating? - What territory? - Thank you very much, man. Well, I'm just saying,. You hang around in the darkness long enough, you're bound to make some dark friends. Well thank you, for telling me that I'm going to hell. You know, if you want to share you religious beliefs with someone, - maybe try a better tactic. - Can you pass me the ham - as well, man? - All right, Thank you very much, thank you. You ever want to see Kate again? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, settle down, take a chill pill! How you holding up, man? I'm fine. You still seeing that therapist - from a little while ago? - No, work's been busy. How 'bout that medication? Is that still giving you some issues? I'm not worrying about it anymore. I just remember you telling me that was making you tired all the time, right? Yeah, I stopped taking it, so, it's not a problem. Oh well, I think that's for the best. You know, I'll be honest with you, man. The fact that this place used to be owned by some sort of religious cult kinda freaks me out a little. Wait, Sean was serious about that? 'Bout what? I thought he was just being an idiot - with the whole cult thing. - No, man. I was with him when he was talking to her. She was talking about some kind of weird voodoo stuff but I don't know, man. She seemed a little bit weird to me herself. Last summer I found a kid at the bottom of the pool of the campground. The kids were always daring each other to sneak into the pool at night. So, we'd make sure to check it a couple of times. And in the past when we busted these kids, we found 'em hiding in the showers waiting for us to leave. So, I , walk through the showers, no one's there. So, I head to the pool and make sure no one's hiding in the water. And I didn't see anything at first but, we got those black lane lines painted at the bottom of the pool and something about the paint looked funny. Like funny peculiar and so, I shined my flashlight at it and I realized it's one of the kids. One of the little kids and he ain't moving. So, I jump in, fully clothed, get him to the shallow end, drag him out of the pool, carry him up the steps, get the CPR going. I'm screaming, you know, for help, top of my lungs. I started to get mad. I was like, "seriously? "Like, seriously, is this seriously about to happen? "Is this kid gonna die at youth camp?" I was so mad and I realized that this kid isn't coming back and our camp medic, James, rushes up, takes over for me on the compressions and I was so mad, man. I just, I just let out this scream of anger. I swear to goodness, man, right when I screamed, the kid spit up like a gallon of water, - started breathing. - Man. - Yeah. - Did y'all have to take him to the hospital, - all that stuff? - Yeah. The ambulance showed up like 15 minutes later. And the official lesson? Right, always with the lessons. Well, the lesson I took away from this was that God's timing is not your timing. That it doesn't always happen the way that it's, that you want it to but it always happens the way it's supposed to. I'm getting cold, guys. That was perfect, Russell. - Dave, it's your turn. - No, I'm gonna go to bed. No man, we all have to tell a story, it's gonna make the whole segment work. That's the whole point of this. - No, sorry. - At least stay and have another beer, man. It's like trying to sleep with a strobe light. If I get eaten by a bear, I have it on film. What? And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how you start a forest fire. Oh, what? - Just please, move. - What are you doing? Something, Hey man, what are you doing, what are you doing? Hey, there's a bathroom in the cabin, you don't need to go out there to go pee, all right, man? You don't need to it on B roll for the show. What are you doing? I'm even more concerned with what you're doing with that mallet bar you found. - Are you okay, brother? - The light was, then there's, something in the fire. - Hey. - What? - Sure you're okay, man? - Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine. You know, Sean, Sean don't mean no harm. You know that. He's just trying to help. Yeah well. Hey, I can't imagine what you've been through. I can't imagine going through that myself. There ain't nothing I, me, or Sean or Paul or anybody's gonna say that's going to make it better. Hold that for safety. Good night, Russell. Good night, brother. Sleep tight, Dave. Hey, well look who's decided to stop spooning! Yeah, yeah. What's Dave doing? Dave's just ready to grip it and rip it. All right, time to switch up the stands. You guys mind if I take the same one as yesterday? Yeah, I do mind, man. The wind is perfect for the West blind, I set that up last week. You're on the South blind today. Oh, there he is. I can't make out how many points on this beauty but nice white chest. It's big, it's big. He's coming this way. What? Kate, how? - Come on now. - Oh,. Come on, we're almost there. Have you done this before or not? I can't do it. - I can't do it. - Come on, come on. We got like 20 feet, come on. Hey man, why don't you pull her? I'll stay here and you drag me too, yeah? - No, sorry. - That's not how this works, - let's go. - I shot her, you drag her, - come on, man. - Been like this - the whole way back. - Hold on, all right. Sooner we go, sooner we leave, - let's go. - All right, all right, - all right. - Let's do it, come on. - Come on, almost there. - Yeah, yeah! You guys see this here buck? This here is the definition of not fun. Well, we have officially wrapped day two of hunting and our first kill winner trophy goes to our famous clown-dash-cook, Russell. Eat it! - Unbelievable. - Now, when you're out on a hunt, the real important thing, when you get that first kill and you bring it back to the cabin, you want to be, What was that? Dave? - What is that? - Dave? Hey Dave, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be okay, man. It's gonna be okay. "Ghost Fever Addicts," episode one, action. - All right, come on, come on. - Hey fellas. Yeah, did you find the alcohol swabs in there, Russ? Yeah, right there, it was right there in the cruiser, I just brought in the whole pack. - All right. - Come on, come here, come here. There you go, look at that, first blood. That's an honor right there, buddy. Technically, I got my deer first, so, that's second blood. Hey, did you download the files yet? No, I need the SD cards, please sir. - Okay. - Stop for a second. Hey man, you're getting blood all over the place. Thank you. - Empty, - Okay, hold on. - What? - Hey maybe it, hey man, maybe it's with your other cards, okay? - Yeah. - It's in the back. Okay, let me get a card. It's not in there. Well, Dave man, don't you have two of those cases? Let me see that camera again, huh? That's the only one - that I have. - It's not in the camera. - Hey, hey! - Where's the, where's the camera that was in tree? - It's over there on the, - Did you leave it - at the stand, maybe? - No. - Did you take it out? - It's not in there! - Where is it? - Hey, settle down man, - settle down. - It's gotta be in my bag, it's gotta be in the bag. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's not in there man! Don't touch me, don't! I'm not crazy, I saw that stuff, there's candles everywhere. Did you get it all? - Seany? - Yeah man, I got it. I think we got to call it, guys? Well what? I think we take him home, we take him to the hospital, whatever we do though, but I mean, we gotta get him outta here. I thought that maybe that this trip would be good for him - but, you know, - Russell, maybe - No. - This is a good thing - for him. - Hey man, I don't know, he's been talking to me about the meaning of the fawn - and candles in the forest, - Yeah, yeah, - He hugged for two hours, - He's been on his own, - He hasn't stopped crying, - He's been on his own and he's been working himself to death since, - Yeah, exactly man. - Look, what could be better than being with friends, enjoying creation and hunting? I don't know, - but it ain't working, - I'm serious, but, look, look, think about those kids at your camp, all right? They are able to have an experience with God because they are at camp, away from distractions, okay? He's just working through some stuff - right now. - Yeah, clearly. Look, I know this is hard but maybe, maybe this is what gets him heading back in the right direction. And we just need to be there for him. Hey. Maybe God is doing something out in these woods. Maybe you're right. Sean, you gotta back off, right man? I think he's fine, man. - He ain't. - All right. All right, fine. Just, stop pushing the buttons, that's it, okay? Thanks. All right, gentlemen, Russell, the second candle that I saw was there in the fire pit. You guys said it wasn't there when you went to bed and I know it's here. Oh, come on, maybe, it was hot when I saw it here and it just melted. But it was there, it was there! I swear it was there. All right, here we go, the first hunting day, this was my stand. That first candle that I was telling you guys about was on the sticks, there was wax all over it. Oh, it was right here, it was right here. Oh God, there's got to be something. Come on, come on! Hey, watch your step. Oh yep, thank you. Whoa, look at this. Oh man, hey we should send some of this footage into "American Pickers" or something, man. Yeah, it's quite the collection for a religious cult. Heh, right? Man, I'm gonna cave your head in through this glass! Ooh , all right come on guys, hurry up, we gotta catch up. Hey, where's Dave? He's already left, man. - What, North blind? - Yeah, it's a long hike, he probably just wanted to get a head start. So, I did get one thing right. I did fall out of my tree stand and I knocked myself out. Must have scrambled my brains because I could have sworn that symbol was carved in that tree right there. And it's not there. Oh my,. The show must go on. You're not gonna believe this. I've been here for less than an hour and look who decides to show up. Look at him. That is one good looking fella. All right, he's at 200 yards. And he's headed this way. Yes, yes, yes! That arrow flew perfectly, it hit him right in the chest. This is a good buck, it's a wide rack, I didn't get a count on how many points, yes! All right, there it is. There's the beginning of our blood trail. I saw him take off South but I didn't hear him fall. So we are following that blood trail. There it is,. And this is why we're out here, folks. Looks like we're going into the woods, let's get that buck. It's been about an hour. Blood trail disappeared. Figure I got a couple hours of sunlight left. I'm gonna keep pushing on. There's no way he didn't go down after that shot. So, not only have I lost the biggest buck I've ever shot, I lost myself, literally. I can't seem to make sense of it. The map is showing a ridge on the Northeast corner of the property. And I have yet to see a ridge on my way out to this stand. I can't seem to backtrack to the clearing, I should have been marking my trails, stupid. This beauty is gonna have to wait until morning, get the boys to come help me out. Hello! Russell! Paul! Sean! Hey, you wanted a ghost story, Sean, here you go. Guys! All right, it is the end of today's hunt and I ain't got nothing to show for it , but I don't care 'cause I already got my doe. But I did have one big old buck come my way. Hello! Yeah, I'm here, can you guys hear me? I'm here! Keep talking! Guys! Guys! Guys! Dave! Dave! Dave! Please! Please! I'm sorry! God, please! Dave, come on, man! Dave, Dave, call out man! Where you at? Sean? Sean? Sean? Sean, come on man. Hey, I'm gonna be right back man, I promise. I'll be right back. Dave! No, no, no. No,. No, no, no, what? Paul? Paul, what's going on man? Hey, hey! Paul! Wake up! Dave! Dave! Hey! I'm coming, man, I'm coming. Come on! I'm coming, I'm coming. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, dude. Hey, hey, hey, hey! No you don't do this, all right? What? You okay? What happened, what happened? What? Answer me man, what, are you okay? What happened? What, what? What is it? She was there,. It was so beautiful,. Now that the footage is out in the public, there has been a lot of controversy. What'd you think when you first saw it? Well, when I first saw it, I had feelings. I mean, I could get feelings from it. So, I thought, you know, this is either manmade and/or God made and then as I watched it again, I thought, "boy, there's some things here "that man couldn't have done "and of course some things that man did do" but, it's a, it's a challenge to see what really happened. So, how did you come to access the footage in the first place? I have a very good friend that's in the family. So, they called me up, you know, that's what I do for a living is find people that disappear and so, they called me up and basically retained my services. So, this is where you decided that you can possibly help them find these guys. At least the ones that are left on Earth, okay? - Absolutely. - Why get involved? Well again, I do this for a living, okay? And this is a, right up Dog's alley, if God's involved, peoples involved, hearts are involved, and I feel good when I do stuff like this. Many people online are saying that it's a bit suspicious that you have a connection with the family along with the missing men. Well, the internet, you know how it is. It said I was passed away, that I died. I try not to believe everything I read online. What do you think actually happened? To speculate right now, I would be kind of fool. So, I'm not sure. I know there was, I'm almost positive there was a divine intervention. Do you suspect that Sean and Paul had something to do with it? So, they did something. That's why God, you know, knocked 'em out or put 'em down in the woods. You don't think it was a set up? I suspect they had something to do with like the gas, - the ropes, - Hm. Something like that but the sound, never. The light, how could they make a light that bright? When you watch something like that, you got the feeling, you do too. And you, you know, the presence of God, - goosebumps, ooh. - Yeah. You know, and so did I and so did everybody else, so. I think it was again, some kind of divine intervention. Do you think the white light was a set up? I don't want to argue with the white light. That is divine, okay? I am almost positive. So, the light I believe was God. God proves he's alive himself, he doesn't need anybody else to do that. Do you think you'll ever find him, any of them? If I don't find them, I'm gonna find out what happened. Anybody can find truth, if they ask the right question. So, can I ask? Why? Why do you believe this has happened? I think God is showing someone something. Or maybe more than one. I don't know exactly what happened, but one thing I do know, he knows what he's doing.
