THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL LIFE EVENTS IS COINCIDENTAL Spirituality is a comprehensive term that includes knowledge, perception, spirit, and the soul of a creature. In a wider sense, it is human. Spirituality is a mysterious world. Even when somebody's dead, we cannot fully comprehend it. And Yin and Yang of all kinds occurs in a circle of karma and causality. Lien Thanh! Take your miasma-suppression glasses off! Look to see whether the soul of the recently dead is still following the funeral or not? Our mission today is… to protect this soul until it's buried safely. Gosh! I can't see him. Look more closely! Gosh! What? He was walking along behind us for a short while. Damn, why are you wearing the miasma-suppression glasses? Please take them off and look for the soul. What do you think? I have to wear them otherwise I'll see much more than I can imagine. But we are working. Geez. Keep showing me the way. Gosh, we've run right into a wedding. Damn, a funeral bumping into a wedding. If a soul is playful, he could follow the wedding too. That's unfortunate. So how's everything? - Tinh Lam! - What? The cat, it jumped over the coffin. That's normal. It's not. The coffin is shaking. It's shaking, yes, and the sky isn't falling. What are you so panicked? My son. Watch out for your cat. It is going to die. Help me. Help. Rest in peace. Rest in peace. But… how can it rise up by itself? It's science. The negative charges of the dead body were dragged up by the positive ones of the cat. It's over once the cat walks further away. - Hey! - What? Why is the soul turning in another direction? That's right. The funeral is done, the soul doesn't know who to follow. Okay, what now? - What now? - Here! Hurry up, it's almost gone! Alright. In this book, find the spell that can call up a spirit. - Read it for me. - Okay, hold it. - Soul Repression Spell. - Pass. Soul Expulsion Spell. - Soul Recall. - Pass. - Soul Recall. - Hey, that works. - Soul Recall? - Read it! Oh! Nonsense, nonsense, spirits, spirits. - Louder! - Shimmering, shimmering. Nonsense, nonsense. Holy spirits are visionary! Hey! What the hell are you reading, dude? - I read what is written here, dude. - Really? Don't know why it became so hilarious… - What the… - Who knows? - Then you've read it wrong. - What to do? Find another way. Over there. Tinh Lam! - What's up? - There's a jet of red smoke. - Huh? - Hey, it's flying over there. Oh no. Red smoke means evil. He smells the new ghost and has come here to suck that one. Perform Ritual! Oh, please, spirit! Hear my call and come back here. Please, spirit, come over here. Mortality remains bitterness, resentment. Please, spirit, don't leave and surrender. Come back and listen to this play. Hey, playing the clattering teacup and hopping around is so the soul will stick around to see you play. Understand? This kind of game consumes so much energy. No other choice. If Thuy Du was here, it would be easier for us to borrow the body. What are you doing next? Exorcising demons. How can you when you're unable to see? Show me while you're playing. Hey, where are you going? No, turn back! Hey, watch out! Turn right. See? I told you. - Where? - You aren't there yet. Nope. On the left. Gosh, on the right. Nope, behind you. - Behind? - Yes. Gosh, it's flying around you. I'm tired! So am I! This is not going to work. - Old way! - Okay. - Where are you? - I'm here. Old way. Alright. Alright, tell me. Where is it? Here. You need to work on your aim. Shoot! - Did I hit it? - Not yet. Keep hopping around. Still missed it? Come on. Here. - Shoot! - Shoot! Why? Do you need help, Tinh Lam? Nguyet Minh! Please, God, Earth, Yin-Yang! Yeah! She got it! Did she? Really? How was it? What's wrong? Help me, Tinh Lam. Keep hopping. Let me help you. Be careful! - Where are you? - In front of you! In front! - Behind you. - Where is it? - In font! - Behind! - Exactly. - In front! - Down! - Down! Gee! Oh my god, sis, the demon just slapped me on my face! - Nope, I did. - Why? - Are you blind? - I am! Catch the sword! Catch, my sword. What's next? - Give it to me. - Here! Turn it… Turn it! - The other way around… - The other way around? Why do you keep turning it around? - I still can't wrap it. - Can't wrap? If it's too hard, use my way. Not yet, tie it down, tie it. Hey, it's moving. Be careful! It's too powerful. Tinh Lam! Put a sword right into the jar. - From the front? - Yes. Why are you dancing? Too strong. The jar is broken. That demon is flying towards me, Tinh Lam! Damn it! The glorious ghost-catching trio of the old days. I know the spell. Lien Thanh has Yin-Yang eyes which help her see the people in the underworld. Thuy Du has the ability to let the soul snatch his body. If only you could accompany us, everything wouldn't go this badly. If only I could see, I would exorcize evil spirits and ghosts. If only I could see, souls would never be eaten by demons. It's all my fault! My fault! Why is injustice so prevalent? It's my fault! - Why? Tell me! - Tinh Lam! - Come on. - Stay calm. If you want to know the cause, you must notice the effect. If you want to see the future, consider your present. Things happen for a reason. God is not being unfair to anyone. Why didn't he let me just die? Why did he treat me unfairly? - Hey. - Why? - Calm down! - Why's that? Let go! Tinh Lam! Sis! Stop hitting him! He's been through so much already. Just calm down! If I can find someone to save your eyes, will you follow me? No, he can't. What do you think? How could Tinh Lam meet his relatives? They always discriminate against and isolate him. Now you've asked him to go and see them? We have to ask for their mercy in this situation. It would create an opportunity for them to insult him. Vu won't let us go. Why, Vu? I don't think it's necessary. Look at Lien Thanh. She can open the Yin-Yang eyes herself. So can you. Let it be. He's quite right. You have to let nature take its course. Yes, wait for a decade to see if you recover them or not. Nonsense! A decade? We can't waste time like this! This is the only chance for me to see again. Please let me go. When I can see again, I will look at you more often. Actually… I know neither I nor the Earth God have the right to stop you. Alright, just go. Make it home safely. I'm home alone. I'm so lonely. What did he say? He said: Okay! He's letting me? Thanks, Vu! I've got to recover my sight this time. Master, I brought my two best friends here to introduce them to you. Bless them and unlock their minds, please. Master, I'm Lanh. I've cut off fate with the netherworld to connect it with mortality. I've been waiting for so long and nobody has come to me. Could you please connect my fate to the netherworld again? I'd rather be loved by a ghost than be forever alone. If you don't treasure what you have, don't regret when you lose it. I'm Hien. Master, my rented home… may have some spirits… The power bills suddenly doubled, Master. Ask the spirits to share the bills with you. As they see the power bills, they can't wait to get a new life. That's right. Everything has to be fair, even yin and yang. Ask them to share the rent with you. She's right. Okay. But, Master, I have one more thing to tell you. I'm overweight now. I don't know what to do. I went on a diet, then took diet pills, even did a lot of charity work. I still can't get thinner. Do you have any way of helping me? You guys should put a voodoo curse on each other. A hex will torture you, make you ill and then you'll be thinner. - No! I have an idea. - What? - We should do more charity. - That's right! The more we do, the greater auras we'll have. Evils will be unable to approach us. You are right. - We are number 1! - Number 1! Trio 1. If you have no questions, please go home, Trio 1. - Let's go. - Go! What's wrong? We're going home. Gosh, this is ridiculous! What is it? This mystic chanting book. Hey. You can't just arbitrarily do that. I'm sorry. I'm just so curious. But I tell you this. As you read this kind of nonsense… you could be bewitched. Don't say that. My parents left me that book. Ah… His parents are extraordinary… If they were alive, they would probably be the best shamans. If they had a chance, they would teach Tinh Lam to be a great shaman. What a bloody accident! Gosh, there were always accidents at this fork. The driver must have been drunk then hit that poor man. As someone died in the car crash like this, their soul will be locked out on the street forever. Can anything help them? If we're destined to meet, I will even help for nothing. Without predestination, I won't help even if you offer me all the treasures. His destiny ends here, he has to take this karma. Miss, how's my son? I am sorry. - Oh my God! - Come quickly! They are dying. What's wrong with you? I suddenly have a headache. Like someone is using a hammer to bash on my head. Does it hurt that much? Gosh, the addresses of this area are a mess. It's impossible to remember. Then what to do? Wait for me here. I'll ask around. Where should I wait? - Here, right here. - It's cooler over here. I'll come back right away. Gosh, why are you suddenly throwing yourself at me? Here, 30,000 VND. Go and get something to eat. Buy whatever you want to eat. - What? - Just found a sacred pagoda. Now let's go there to do charity. I'm going to draw a fortune stick. I've been so unlucky recently. I must ask for a number to catch up with the lottery result this evening. - Go! - Go! Gosh, they give me 30,000 VND. How precious it is! I've enough with these lottery tickets. I don't need this 30,000 VND. Gosh… I think you're right. You should buy some tickets for her. I'm just talking to myself. I thought you were talking with someone else. Are you blind? Yes, I am. Are you? - Yes. - Gosh, I'm so sorry. Never mind. Where are you going? I'm looking for a doctor. As you sell tickets around here, do you know someone named Ut Quai? - Ut Quai! - Yes. Alright, now take the small road. After the small road, turn to the big one. I'm just saying it, you're not going to see anything by the way. I have a friend that guides me. - Do you? - Yes. That's fine. - Thank you. - Alright. Aren't you going to buy lottery tickets? I'm buying, of course. I'll take ten tickets. That's very nice of you. Okay, here. Thank you. Yes. Tinh Lam! - Hello! - Hi! I know where Ut Quai is. Follow me. Okay. Bye bye, granny. I wish you could recover your sight. Thank you so much. Hello, Uncle. These are our family's genealogy records. Before opening their third eye, everyone has problems with their eyesight. Look! Here, you see? See? Hell, if I see. I forgot. What happened to my eyes? Let me check. Your eyes are in the sleep, rest stage… before they are initiated into the spirit world. Is there any way you can make an exception? Give me your hand! May our guardian listen to my prayers and show themselves unto us. Summon the God Warrior. Uncle! How is it? Very bright! - Bright? - Yes! I can see your future. It's very bright. Really? I'll soon cure you of that. - You agree to cure me? - Yes! Thanks so much, Uncle. Let's high five. I'm sorry. Are you okay? My fault. We just got here. We need a place to stay for few days. I hope for acceptance from you all. Please, God, Earth, Yin-Yang. Hear my call, bring me wandering souls. Hello! We are mysterious and friendly ghosts. Ut Quai brought us here to improve ourselves morally, waiting for the salvation of our souls! Ut Quai calls us… The Power Rangers. Ladies and gentlemen, these are classic deaths. Last time I put the right blinker on, then turned left in order to trick the truck. And here is the consequence. I… I am dead because of a stabbing. Damn, he grabbed a knife, this big. He stabbed, stabbed… Didn't miss a beat. Me, no time for any last words. I… Alright… you had Tuberculosis, didn't you? Yes! I got in a fight with my boyfriend. I intended to jump off the bridge to scare him. It turned out that I was dead, for real. So unfortunate. Why do people die of a broken heart? My sister, she committed suicide because of love too. Oh yes… Where is Nguyet Thi? She's weak. It's dangerous to walk her here. You scared me to death. Why? You know, you're like a little ghost. A ghost scared of ghosts? Power Rangers! Dismissed! No conversation exchanges at night. Burn! Fire! Please accept my offering. Please accept my offering. What's wrong? Oh my gosh! Oh, that little… Are you playing the piano? 1, 2, 3, 4 and vice versa, huh? I'm burning the joss papers to mark the occasion. - You're doing it? - Yup. I thought the house was on fire! Are you crazy? Why would I be standing here if it was on fire? - It's too much smoke. - It's not smoke. It's because it's going to rain. Hey, why are you here? I'm new to the area. I rent a room from Master Ut. - What? Master Ut? - Yes. I'm kowtowing to Master Ut, kowtowing to Master Ut. What's the matter? Is he really excellent? The best in the area. He's number one here. I asked him to take me under his wing. He refused even though I volunteered to clean the altars. If he hadn't entered into religion, I would have liked to marry him. Come on, why do you keep asking? I forgot. Here, this is the car for the God of wealth. I burn what he offers. I burned this paper sword. The hospital… damn, I've burnt the bra instead! Why does the hospital need a bra? Do paper objects have such things? Son! - Where are you going? - To grab a drink! Drink what? Stay home, I'll take care of everything. Come on, go in! - There are only demons outside. - Hurry up. Oops, please accept my apology, I offer you this sword. Please accept my apology. A Trataka lesson, purify your eyes with yoga from India. Look! How can he? Because now he can't see so he can't look. The issue is that he can't look at the thing that he needs to see. The issue is he doesn't see so he can't look at it. If he sees now, he can look at what he needs to look at. The things that he can't look at now because he doesn't see. The problem is I try to see but still can't look at what I have to look at. Everything on earth has its negative… or positive energy depending on its characteristics. Candles have a positive characteristic while your eyes have a negative one. That's why we use the positive as compensation for the negative. Got it? If a candle doesn't have enough positive energy shall we increase the number of the candles? Are we curing the eyes or are we in a sauna? It serves a double purpose. What is he doing? Infection. Master Ut said he must look at the sun to absorb the positive energy so that his eyes can be cured. Oh my God. He's human. He sees what he wants to see. You're a ghost. Do you want to be dissolved by doing that? Do you want to die because of poor knowledge? Then kill me. Anything else to say to me? I said… I… Gosh, can you please speak less so that your lungs will be more stable? What's that? You don't get it, do you? We are ghosts, we can't see the sun. See you tonight! I'll walk you to see Miss Moon. This is hot, salty water. Open up your eyes! Get an eyewash. Too cold. That's like child abuse. Is it possible that he'll die before his eyes are cured? This is more comfortable. But there's something strange. Boy's piss. Let me go. That's gross. Let me go. Help me, please! Tinh Lam! Listen to me, be a good girl as I'm not home with you. Do your homework, okay? Listen to Ms. Nam too. Don't screw up! Okay. Love you! I'll be back soon. Thanh! Hey, I'm here. Alright, okay. It smells of hospital. It is going to cost us, you know. Cost what? Just lie here. How are you? Fine, I'm still good. You all right? Okay, let's go. - Go where? - To have your eyes checked. What? As we're here, let's have your eyes checked. As we're here? You did it on purpose to get me here? What are you saying? This is good for you though. How is that good? Scientific diagnosis can't help me in this case. It's a waste of time. That did not count. Why don't we just try? The hospital has relatively good machines and equipment. So you can be cured properly. If we keep doing it in Master Ut's way, it's more like physical abuse. I did this because I believed in him. If you don't trust him, then don't come. But it's way too hard for you. Since when have you decided my life? From the moment I thought of you as part of my family. I even asked my neighbor to watch my sister, Khanh. You're human, you can't see this thing. Everything I did was just to help you to see again. If you don't like it, we'll go home. Sorry! Gosh! Who's pounding on the door? Nobody. Take your miasma-suppression glasses off! What? Take them off! That's creepy. Quick! - Lam! - What? A demon! It's going behind the doctor. It's even turning around and glancing at me. - Gosh, it looks disgusting. - Calm down! I've never seen such a disgusting demon as this. Stay calm! But now… Did you bring your full kit? Yes, I did. Let's go! Come here. Gosh, it's so naughty. Where are you running to? - Ms. An! - What? Aren't you releasing the captives today? Is it a full moon today? Don't you think it's your birthday? Let me handle it first then I'll go. See you at same place! Hang on! Buy me a crocodile. Are you insane? Crocodile is dangerous. What if it bites the hell out of us? No. I mean buy me an ugly fish because it's cheaper. I'll buy you a bulging fish. Bulging fish is the fish that lies under the cellar… Its forehead bulges. Ya! Do you really get it? Understand? Bulging fish is the kind of fish that has a lump here, we call it Flower Horn. Got it. Don't act like that anymore. I mean buy cheap fish anyway! Snakehead or carp is fine too. Is there any food yet? Coming now! Let's go! Come here! - Where is it? - It's flying to the elevator. Excuse me, coming through! - Girl, let me come through! - Where are you Thanh? But… it's because… Hold on… Here! Which floor? I saw the elevator stop at floor one. Excuse me. I can't see, I'm sorry. Thank you. - Wait! Lam! - Oh my! - Where are you, Thanh? - I'm here! - Where? Where are you? - Here! Gosh, seriously? Were the other elevators broken too? Why is everyone rushing back in one place? How did you press the button? On the button, it's always written "for the visually impaired." There it is! Slow down. - Hurry up, it's turning to the room. - Slow down. I can't see. Take it slower. - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry. Is it your turn to come in? So sorry, doctor. My friend is exhausted. He's going to pass out, doctor. Can you take a look at him please? Alright, take your seats. Yes, thanks doctor. Ask her something. What's your problem? Doctor… A normal person has no problems with his sight… Suddenly he can't see anymore. What's wrong with him, doctor? Vision impairment has many causes. For example, lack of oxygen to the brain. The eyes are unable to receive the blood supply due to cholesterol blockage. Does your friend smoke? No. I don't smoke. I just inhale lots of incense. That could be one of the reasons. But it would cause temporary blindness for a few seconds. But… I haven't seen for more than six months. Let me check your eyes. How is he? This is strange. I'll contact you to do more research about this. This is my business card. I can't find it anywhere. Thanks, doctor. Call me if you have any questions. Yes! Thanks, doctor. Let's make a kissy face like the fish. 1- 2-3! We are number one! Release them quickly or they may go rotten. Don't say that. Pray! Yes, pray… Thanks God! Please wish us luck and success. Wins everywhere we're going to. Look, it's so cute to see them play in the water. - Go home! - Let's go. Little fool boys, how can you breathe with a plastic bag over your head? Yah… Enough playing. Let's go up. EQUANIMITY We should eat vegans on full moon day. - That maintains peace of mind. - Right. Exactly! To regain our inner peace. - Where is the food? - Coming. Miss! Would you please lower your voice a little bit? - We have softened our words. - Oh my goodness… I speak so softly! Let's not be hasty. Why didn't she talk to us? Got it… She looks like a poor peasant. Look at her, she's scraping the plate with leftovers… It's disgusting. Look at her short hair! It's even uglier than that of normal people. Hey don't you want her to join our short-hair team? Come on. Never. - The Four Beauties? Forget it. - No way. - Three of us are number one. - Number one. Go on, eat up. Why are you still standing here? Run! Run? Where? Hey, I'm talking to the soul. There's still time if you chase after the body. What is the color of that soul? Gray! There's still a chance. Run quickly so you can get into the body. Distracting spirits! Try to disperse them. This girl is interesting. She learned the dance so well that she didn't miss a beat. Again! This is not going to hold for long. What to do? Use this rattle drum. Sing "Up La Khoai" and shake it. Souls will go after you. Got it? Catch! Quick! Sing! Why are you just shaking it? Up La Khoai… And 12 pinwheels Some wear a white shirt The others wear a black one Some carry lanterns The others hold a clyster They have all gone… The spirit just has been banished, come stand before me… I order you! This is difficult. Hey, where is it? Where is it? Ah, please… I'm looking for a yellow piece of paper. I can't see. Could you please help me find it? I'm not giving you any more of my stuff. You dropped it into a basin. Now it only works in fits and starts. Serpent and Dragon fell into a well The cat fell into a cellar The monkey laughed out loud Oh, god, the demon has entered a human body. Security! Are there any security guys in the basement? I want extra security on the third floor right now! We have a situation here. Help me, Minh! Close the Possession. Expel the occult. I order you! Lien Thanh! Tinh Lam! - Tinh Lam! - Tinh Lam! Tinh Lam! Dad. Mom. Thuy Du. Tinh Lam! Why don't you lie down and rest? What's wrong with you? I have recovered my sight. A… Aladdin and the oil lamp. Gosh! Where did it come from? Oh my. This is the general hospital not obstetrics, why do people shout a lot here? Number one. Number two. Very good! How about this? - Is it? - You got it. Yes, obviously. This one? Which number? I can't see it clearly. Number three. Number three. - Number one. - Eh? This is a mudrā, guys. - She's not clear though. - Is that a mudrā? Why it's like this, like that… - Hello? - We're in trouble. You should go home now. Ask Tinh lam to go with you too. I can't see at distance… - Move it closer like this. - Guys, pack and go home. We have some trouble at home. We're having fun. Why are you being weird? Looks like she's having fun but it's strange. Why strange? Yesterday, as we were in trouble, she was peeking out there. But she waited until we called to go out. Help, Master! Oh my! Please help my son, Master. Help my son! Uncle Ut! He's Uncle Ut, isn't he? What's happening, miss? You're An, a vegetarian, aren't you? It's her! This isn't exactly what I had in mind. I imagined that you had long hair. My hair went with those joss papers that I often burn. How can you see again? Ah yes, I recovered my sight. Please help my son! Miss, what happened to him? Yes, what's wrong with him? They ate dog meat… after that… Properly, they may eat hyena. What is hyena? Hyena is a kind of smart dog. These dogs don't always bark, but when they do, it's because they can see the spirits. Gosh, really? Hey… Stand aside. I need to focus to jump in… Uncle Ut, let me help you. You can't see. How could you help? Be careful. Stay away. See? Told you. I recovered my sight. What? What did you just say? I said that I had recovered my sight. Stop! When did it happen? Stop! Say it! When? When I got up this morning. Can you see clearly now? Not very. Are you two done? This guy has wrestled the pants off me! God, please don't do that. What if they're suffocating him. Seal of Fire and Air. Tight encirclement. Oh my… Oh my… my son. Is he alright? What's wrong? Why did he pass out when we haven't used the Soul Expulsion Spell? The demon might be scared of being burned in the fire. Hold on, you said Phuoc and his friend ate dog meat, right? Yes they ate a dog… Where is his friend now? My goodness, is he being possessed by a ghost dog or a werewolf? Evils of all places, follow my prayers. Summon Dog-Hit Cane. What is Dog-Hit Cane? It's a cane used to hit a dog. Damn it! Damn! Ugly dog! I'll hit you to death! I'll hit you to death! Uncle Ut! Let me! Chase it! Hey, wait for me! Why are you all running away? What about these two crazy dogs? Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Let me handle it. Hang on! He's scared. Leave him to me. Hey. - Good! Love you. - Good boy. - Love you. - Master. What about my son? Shut up. It's alright. Here's your bone. My… my son… he… Are you good? Calm down. Your bone, here! Love you, love you much. Love you very much. Very good. A dog just needs love. After the accident, My soul had been expelled, flew everywhere and lingered in strange worlds. Just a vague feeling of misery like I was dreaming. I didn't know where I was. However, luckily, each part of my soul was found and collected by Tinh Lam's parents. They also taught me to control my soul and wait for everything here steady. That's why I have seen you guys again. But hey, did my parents tell you anything? Tell Tinh Lam… Find "Thien Tam." Thien Tam? Did they tell anything more specific? You will understand. Hey wait! How did you know that we were here? I sent a spirit to follow Tinh Lam. Hey, that's why I dreamt of you. Oh! Cheers. - Cheers. - Damn it! As life is unfair, a pilot can never drive a bus. I was hit by a car and so was Thuy Du. He breathes air while I have to breath incense smoke. I'm asking you. Are there any guys that could live after losing their heads? I'm just asking. Why so serious? When? This is it. Can you do like me? Excuse me! Alright! Dirty! 1- 2-3 breathe! It's cold. Feels like I just passed by some spirits. Are you drinking, guys? Why didn't you tell me? I really like you guys. Just tell me. I'll bring you food. I'm supposed to release these crabs tomorrow. - Yes. - But I decided to buy more. Others to release. I brought wine. This is medicinal wine to drink not to massage. One cup each. I owe you all a lot. You saved my son. Are you afraid of ghosts? Nope, because I've never seen a ghost in my life. I'll believe it when I see it. When you see it? Minh! You should call Nguyet Thi to come here. Yes, call Thi. Nguyet Thi is weak. We can't call on her. She's sick. My sister is dead. You're kidding me. You guys are nasty. Stop kidding me like that. She really is dead. Come on! Stop joking! You've got to be bloody kidding me. No more messing around! - She is dead. I'm serious. - It's true. She passed away. Ooh, you guys are so in sync. If you don't believe me, please take a look. Gosh! You're twins? There's only her in this photo. Here! - This is your photo. - Where? Gosh… It's Nguyet Thi! You must have a third eye to see this. - Okay… - Third what? - Come on, cheers! - Right. - Hey, let's drink. - Here comes the food. Hey, hello. - Why are you here? - I came by to say thank you. These guys did an excellent job this morning. My son would have been in danger if they weren't there. I'm indebted to you all. - Yes. - Thank you. You did nothing this morning. So I came over here to thank them. You're saying that I didn't do anything? Yes, you danced. A little bit. If I hadn't danced, would your son have been alive? You danced, yes, but these kids they did a greater job. Shut up! - Tinh Lam. - Yes. - Your sight has recovered? - Yes. Though you still can't see very clearly now. Yes. I think you should stay here with me. I will follow up on your condition. Follow my method, you'll see clearly soon. Yes. Hey, cheers! Let's toast! - Let's drink! Drink! - Let's drink for me. Tell me if you want to have some food. Hey dear! BINH HOA TEMPLE God, you frightened me. Where are the other kids? - Granny. - What? My sight was recovered. Your sight was recovered? Yes. Oh my god! Thanks God! My beloved boy can see again. I'm very happy. I'm so happy for you. But now I just can see shapes. Can you see me? Can you see me? Am I beautiful? I can see that your face is as round as the moon. Damn you! Oops, I forgot. I bought some fruit to celebrate. Let's celebrate… - Your bright eyes… - Here. What is it? These bananas are big… Singapore bananas. Let me smell. They smell good! They do. Give me a half then. Eat one banana and you'll stick to your bones. Just a half. Here. Is it Barbados cherry? No, it's not. Something like that. No, the smell is different. Please just try it. It's sweet and sour, isn't it? Here, have some. - Is it good? - Yes. This is the first time… that I've eaten this fruit. They are sold a lot on the street. Why don't you ask your kids to buy it for you? They all have their own families. They have to take care of them. About me, I'm… By selling lottery tickets, I think I have enough. If need be, I'll ask you to buy me something to eat. - Then I'll buy you fruit from now on. - Okay. Let me give you a kiss. Nice! Are there any problems with my nerves? Why do we need to do a CT scan of my brain? There is much need for further research. Because the eyes receive light through pictures. Whether the pictures can reach the brain or not, depends on the optical nerves. Why does it sound too complicated? It's not just complicated, it's super complicated. Let me have a look at your eyes. Hang on, doctor. Would you mind stepping a bit closer? A little closer. A little more. Are you going to kiss each other? I have an emergency. I got to go. You look completely puzzled. Let's go catch the ghost. I don't see any. What are you going to catch? Got it. Why do you have to be so loud? - Get in line! Line up! - Let me put them separately. Can I borrow $100 from you? It's this big craze right now. I need more money to do charity. I'll pay you back after I collect my share in the tontine. Alright. - What a crowd. - Gosh, please get in line. We only give food to those who have tickets. - Thuy Du! - Please stand in the back. Yes, stay in line. - Help me. - Did you buy all of this? Yes, I did. I spent a lot of my money to buy hundreds of meals. You know what for? To accumulate good karma. I have been struggling a lot in life… How about Phuoc? He's being taken care of in hospital. What's the good in eating these charity meals? - Yes… - Give me a hand. Here, pass those around. Stick this into the box. They'll have spoons to eat. Get in line, please. Two tickets get two meals. - Give me a hand. - Let's move. Hey guys, listen! Hey, I spent the money. Stand here so people will know that I'm doing charity. Guys! Do it here! - Granny! - Gosh! I was distributing charity meals at the hospital this morning. I got two for us. - Great! - Here. So I don't have to buy lunch today. Free of charge. It's very delicious even though it's for charity. CHARITY FOOD MRS. AN CONTACT Miss An's charity meal. That's Auntie An - our neighbor. Do you know her? She's a bit loud but very enthusiastic. I don't know how her life is but she has done a lot of charity work. She lives for everyone. Let's eat. What do you want? You want me to feed you? - No! - Let me. No! It's embarrassing. Don't be embarrassed. Here. Nom nom… Little boy… You, little boy… Hey you… - Got you. - Ouch, it hurts. It's a mosquito bite. Where, where's the mosquito? I've been calling you. Are you daydreaming? - Who are you in love with? - No one. Yes, no one. Don't tease me. Don't lie to me. Let me tell you, I'm much older than you. Tell me who? It's… because… I'm scared. Gosh, you're too young to be scared. - She's a doctor. - Oh, man. She'll give you a shot. Gosh, I'm not ill. It will be a disaster if you do that to her. What are you saying? Don't tease me. Alright, whoever you love, just love one person at a time. I don't like affairs. Just love one person at time? Yes? So I'm not going to love that doctor anymore. Hey, why? Because I loved you first. This sweetie… Only you. Uniquely you. No one could ever replace you. So cute. Dry trees don't sprout buds easily… Parents cannot live With their children forever One day when the old tree falls down Nourish and effort Will no longer be useful Lien Thanh. Lien Thanh. - Lien Thanh. - What? Have you seen my spell book? It's yours. Why you asking? I haven't seen it. Where did you last see it? If I knew, why would I ask? Why are you mad at me? Nope, because I'm pissed off. I intended to read it when my sight came back but now it's gone. Alright, stop sweeping. Come find it with me. Oh my gosh. I have my head back on my neck. No more wiggling. Hey guys… Tinh Lam, Lien Thanh. Did Thuy Du lend you his body? Yes. I borrowed his body. I'm revived. I shouldn't have committed suicide to prove my love. This was very unlucky… seriously. My turn. I'm alive. I got to find the stabber, I got to stab the hell out of him… - Calm down. - Hey. Goodness, how can your soul be free when you're far too aggressive? Take it easy. Gosh, look at him. His skin looks so baby smooth! No more burns, no more infection. You guys, please take care. Are you possessed? Why do you keep making fun of spirituality? Do you know it's very dangerous? Yes. You don't have any manners, do you? Stop doing that! You've got to be more careful, guys! Are you sure it was Minh? Apart from you and me, Minh was the last one to know about this spell book. Come in! Go over there! What is this? Nguyet Minh often uses this. Look, right here. Hey, better take your glasses off. Check this out. I got a sudden headache. I sense a lot of bad energy around here. What the hell is it? Huh? The demon in the hospital. So? She's sticking her head out to look at me. - Where? - She's in there but just flying away. Where is she now? What's wrong? Come on… Call Thuy Du now, quick! - For what? - Screw it! Tinh Lam! Come here! Hurry up! It's her. It's bedtime… why did you screw up my sleep? It's when ghosts act up and corrupt. Aw, screw those ghosts! - Quick! - Hey. Hang on! Where are we going next? Let's look, Thanh. - Tinh Lam! - What? This is where the accident occurred. It's very dark here. How dreadful is the corner! There are no signs! That's why I felt heavy in the head every time I passed this road. The bad energy is strong here. This might be the demon's territory. Whoever's not conscious or alert, will fall off easily. Because the demon will pull them down. Holy crap! How could it be so cruel? How could they do that? Such scumbags. Get him for me! - You want that? - Do it! Pull the slack! Oh, please, good spirits. Hear my call, come over here. Please spirits, lead the way for us. Seek out female demon. Show yourself now! What? Hey, they're standing out of the circle. You almost spread it on their heads. Oh my gosh, really? Can you hear what they're saying? No, I can't. They're whispering. It's hard to hear. Actually sounds of spirits are at different frequencies. If yours doesn't match with theirs, you'll never be able to hear them. We are just lost souls. We don't dare to snitch on that demon. Why? Give it one more time. Let's see what they try to tell us. I'm scared. Don't tempt me. I'm scared… Want to hang out? That's so dangerous! They all left. What's wrong? Think it's tough to find this demon. That's so weird. There's another way to lure her out. What way? Who's handsome here, raise your hand! What a fool I am! Now I'm being offered as a sacrifice to the gods. To demons not gods. Oops, still talking. Because the demon has strong bad energy. She will easily be attracted tangibly to the one who has a strong positive energy. And you certainly fit this role. Excuse me. Remember, don't let yourself go out of this circle. - I get it. - We will find cover. - Where? - Hide. - Where? - There! - Where? - We'll have you covered. Don't worry. - Stay there, okay? - Yes. Remember the poem! - Take care of me. Take it seriously! - Okay. Listen, be careful. That demon's face is disgusting. Are you crazy? The bride with the groom Who broke the vase Blamed it on the kids Getting their butts whooped The bride with the groom Who broke the vase Blamed it on the kids Getting their butts whooped The bride with the groom… MOM CALLING Hey, my phone has fallen out. Tinh Lam! Lien Thanh! Gosh, my mom is calling. Please pick it up for me. Tinh Lam! Lien Thanh! I'm listening, Mom. Damn! Thuy Du! Gosh! I told you that you shouldn't step out of the circle! What happened? Are you okay? Stand up! Tinh Lam! Thien Tam… It's me, your Thi Kieu! Since I died… my soul has been lingering on this road waiting for you until now… despite being told I was a cruel demon. Why must you be such a fool? Why didn't you move on from this place? No! My soul will never be at peace. What did I do wrong that you had left me silently? I'm so sorry. I knew a shaman was not allowed to love someone. Because the bad energy around me would give you a fatal illness. I had no other choice. But do you know? The further you go, the more I suffer. I was looking ahead and expecting you to return. I couldn't believe… that you were blind from too much crying. That's why in this life, Tinh Lam is blind to pay the karma. I had to go after many people to approach you and Tinh Lam. However, struggles and obstacles never seemed to be far. In this life, I'm not Thien Tam anymore. Now I'm just a flashback of Tinh Lam's previous life. So I couldn't be with you. Please let all the resentment go. Remove all the karma so we both can let our souls escape and let Tinh Lam's eyes recover fully, complete the Noble Eightfold Path. No! What are you doing? It was difficult for her to see me. It was difficult for her to move on. Why did you do that? You're not allowed to consort with demons, Tinh Lam. Consort with demons? You say I was consorting with demons? Or was it you who did that? What are you saying? You were at the hospital that day. If I hadn't seen and called you, you would let that demon kill Tinh Lam, wouldn't you? We found this in your room. You have raised a demon and ordered it to kill me. Why did you do that? Calm down, Tinh Lam. Why are you two talking to Minh like that? I'm not letting this go. You are carefree at any time. You've been confined to bed lately. Do you know what has happened? It's Minh who ordered the demon to kill me. And this is not the first time. That is not true. She always helped us. Help? God! Thuy Du! The demon that went into you yesterday is from her too. Is it true, Minh? Yes! I raised a demon. I released it to harm you. Because I can see Tinh Lam's future is a threat to my life. Thi Kieu was dead. And you will have no chance to recover your sight. Why would you do this? Tinh Lam! - Stop! - Calm down, Tinh Lam. Everything is done. You must hate me a lot now. Assume that I was finally done with you. Hope you can see again soon. Wait! Where's the mystic chanting book? Things have gone this far. If I took it, I would return it. Hello, is that Lam? We've collected your medical record. You can get it this evening. According to the CT scan, you've been diagnosed with arteriovenous malformation. It means that every time you feel stressed or get high blood pressure, It will cause a brain aneurysm that will burst. That leads to constant headaches. When blood vessels burst, they cause blood clots in your brain squeezing into the occipital. What is occipital? Simply put, it is an area of the brain associated with eyes. If it is blocked, we can't see anymore. Then why was I able to see again? If it gets worse, you may have stroke. But Lam just has mild symptoms. When the blood clot breaks up, you'll see again. Ah… That's great. - Hey! - What? Why are you so good? That's why I'm a doctor. Just saying. I had to spend a lot of time doing a lot of research. This is not my specialty. Why are you staring? You look pretty. Then keep going. Gosh, I'm honest. You may look very focused and quite literal while working. Now you look cute. You are… strange and interesting… but weird too. You describe me as a sort of creature not a human. - Nhi… - Huh? I don't know how to say… I have a feeling that my ring finger… and your ring finger are connected by a red thread. People say it is a destiny thread. But I don't think we make it. Why? Because I'm a shaman. What are you saying? You're obsessed with those movies you watched, aren't you? You're always kidding me. My patients are waiting for me. I have to go. Granny! Granny! How do you feel? I'm still good. I feel better now. You really got me worried. Why worried about me? I prepared lottery tickets this morning then I didn't feel well. I called the ambulance myself. Am I good? How much more fun can you have? Fun what. I'm old. That's what my life is. Why you worried about me? Everyone has their own lives. What? Why are you crying? Don't cry. Ever since my parents died… It's been a long time that I've felt the love of yours… just like the love of my family. That's why I'm really scared. I love you. Don't be sad, boy. That's the way it is. Don't be sad. Listen to me. Sometimes family members… may not love each other. They love outsiders, strangers. That's why we are made up by the love of people around us. What do you mean? Who upsets you? No one… Perhaps I didn't love them as much as they wanted. It is misunderstood that way. That's life. Things aren't always the way they seem. Things have gone this far… If I took it… I would return it. That's like child abuse. Is it possible that he'll die before his eyes are cured? If we practice looking at the candles or blow incense ash into the eyes or wash the eyes with salt water, can I recover my sight completely? It depends on how many candles Smog in the air is dangerous enough. Incense ash much more so! How about looking at the sun at noon? The UV radiation is dangerous for eyes. Exposure to direct sunlight could burn the corneas, causing permanent blindness. Lien Thanh! Thuy Du! They all went out. Uncle Ut! I want to ask you something. Why did you agree to cure my eyes? I am deeply indebted to them. I mean your parents. Them bringing me up made me who I am today. So, I am very happy to see you again. You said that you always wanted to help me. But as I can see that everything you did was always aimed at destroying my eyesight. I can't get what you said. TINH LAM Why did you tell me that they went out? Master! If Tinh Lam is your nemesis, why don't you kill him? What's the use of sucking his spirit? Since I read his palm… I foresaw that his eyesight would be recovered and he would gain powerful magic to rise against me. So I planned to send demons to curse him. But I don't know why. He still recovered his sight at last. So the only way is to kill him. However, being a shaman, It's not easy to kill him. That's why the only way is to drain his soul away, make him go mad. As this big joss stick burns out Tinh Lam will not be who he is now. Lien Thanh! You awake? Push my back… Push my back. Are you mad? Why are you shouting? I know Phuoc hit us. Be quiet! Phuoc, carry it for me. Gosh, why do you have spiritual food under your armpit? My hands are not free. Where do I put it? - Here. - I must say that… you are richly blessed that the master took you under his wing. He never accepted my request. - You know why? - Why? He said I was young, while you were too old for him. I'm old but I'm experienced. I've brought him lots of customers. My benefits are boundless. Where should I put this, Phuoc? Leave it to me. Who made things unorganized? That was me. My help made you who you are today. Do you know how important it is? How dare you louse it up? No disrespect, Master. Why is she here, Phuoc? Huh? We are now a family cause you took him as your disciple. I would like to ask you this. Is today your wedding? Why all these red tablecloths? Setting up an altar to liberate the souls of the deceased power rangers. Even the power rangers need soul liberation? Ah, this is the power rangers… These are ten, not just five supermen. Enough! Where's Tinh Lam? Can you? Let me. Didn't work anyway. Tinh Lam! - Tinh Lam! - Tinh Lam! Lam! - Oh my god, stay with me, Lam. - What's wrong with him? We still have to fix a lots of things. What's happened to you, Lam? - What's wrong with him? - Lien Thanh, Thuy Du! Hey, did you hear that? Hear what? It seems like someone is talking. Who talked? Who did? Are you mad? I heard nothing. Shut up, let me hear. Lien Thanh! Thuy Du! Help me, Lien Thanh. Lien Thanh! Right, I'm up here. Up here. Are you sure? What is it, Master? Oh my! Do you even know how important, how spiritual it is? Go home! Go! Go away! - Phuoc, ask him to keep me here. - What are you doing? Tell him, Phuoc. - Mom. - I promise I'll keep still. Alright. Master, please let her stay. I can't stand her mumbling. Scatter the salt! No, I'm not going home. I'm not. Oh my god. Get out of here! Thank you so much. I'm so happy. I'm released. Nguyet Thi? Yes. Why are you here? Master Ut caught me to threaten my sister Nguyet Minh. Threaten? Threaten what? - Who's threatening who? - Hold up… He caught Nguyet Minh to lure Tinh Lam here. He also looked for the spell book of Tinh Lam's family. Nguyet Minh was scared that my spirit would be dispersed… - What? - She did whatever he wanted. - What? - Gosh! What's up? It's all a misunderstanding! Guys, my sister is a good person, not bad, as you think. Alright, I got it. Do you know how to save Tinh Lam? Tinh Lam's soul has been sucked out and dispersed into the bowl of blood on the altar. Let him drink up that bowl to call on him. - Hurry up! - How? What to do, Thanh? Selfish. What do you have to lose? Phuoc! Put the incense on the five small altars. - Quick! - Yes. Hear my call, five spirits… That time has come. Time to move on… I order you! So happy! I'm going to be reborn, Mom and Dad! Le Mi Thien Dieu. I'm so excited! First time getting a new life. I'm as worried as the first time that I was dead. Hurry up! It's not just you getting a new life. Come on! Quick! Why is she screaming? Is it really horrible inside that jar? It's probably her first time… no wonder… she's panicking… Ly Truong Le. Whose name is it? My name… a combination of three surnames. Goodbye, guys. I'm going to get a new life. If it's fated, I'm sure I'll see you again. Come on! Quick! This is not reincarnation. We've been cheated. He lured us to feed the demons. Oh my god, there's no way out! We can't get away! We can't get away… Got it! Are you okay? How do you feel? - Go hide in this jar again, Nguyet Thi. - Does it hurt? Right here. We will help you get out of here. Hold on. Ut hides the spell book under the altar. Lien Thanh! Hurry up! - Huu Phuoc! - Yes? Check the shrine, right now! Yes! SPELLS Mom. Guys, hide in this. Quick! Oh, please, spirits! Living undercover, please come back here! You're safe now. Try to hide in here for a while. My kids! What are you doing? I'm setting up the altar to pray for the salvation of these souls. I don't believe you anymore. It's clear that you feed the souls to those demons. Wrong! So wrong! That's why you didn't let me stay. You're blinded by the demons, Tinh Lam! I'm going to exorcise you. Gate of Heaven and Hell. Open. From all corners of Earth. Come here. What's happening? He just opened the Dead lands boundary. Yin-yang reveals all things. As we're in this salt circle, we'll clearly see each of the souls. Be careful, everyone. I'm about to see the demon. Amida Buddha! You're far more knowledgeable than I thought. Get out! Tinh Lam! This is the demon that followed and thwarted us. What? Why can't I see anything? It's probably you that's behind all of these? This was your plan in order to harm me all along? Yes, you're right! Young shaman, fight with me. Let me see your power! Come on, bring it! Nothing to fear. We're all here. There's nowhere to run! - Finish him off. Come on! - Hold on! We have to perform the ritual if we want to fight with him. Summoning the God Warrior. Let's do it! May our guardian listen to my prayers and show themselves unto us. Summon the God Warrior. Everything I saw… happens at this moment. Good! My possessed body! Huu Phuoc! Phuoc! Don't listen to him! Don't listen to him! What's happened to my son? - Don't come inside. - My son is in there! - Why can't I come inside? - That's the underworld. You're human. It's very dangerous for you. He's no longer her son. It turns out that Phuoc has the spirit possession base. Right! I realized it… when he was possessed by the dog demon. That's why I took him as my disciple. Oh my god, my son! Don't scare me. What do I do? Please save my son! - Stay calm, please. - No more talk! Fight! God, why are you beating me son? Thuy Du! Auntie, do you have a lot of joss papers? Yes, a lot. Come, come with me! Gosh. Phuoc, my son… My poor son. Lam! Very nice, Tinh Lam. Ouch, it still hurts. Astral projection! Hey, hurry up! He's done. Hurry up! Hurry! Quick! He's back! Quick! You can't hit my friend! Put it on your head! Nice! He has a sword. He gets a sword? Why can't I see it? You're a human, you can't see this. Are we going to burn more? Yes, burn two more swords. That's really not fair. Where did he get these swords? I burnt them. I prayed his name Nguyen Huu Phuoc. Gosh, you can't do that. As you're a mother, you'll understand. How do you feel when your son is beat up? Come on, Phuoc! Thuy Du! It's enough! Nguyet Minh! Tinh Lam, I apologize for the pain that I've caused. No matter what happens to me and Nguyet Thi today, I won't allow him to flourish anymore. You! You betrayed me? You knew that anyone who was up against me, would have a tragic end. Please, God, Earth, Yin-Yang! Hear my call, expel the spirits! Summon more spirits to fight me? Great! Celestial Spirit. Quickly come here. Jeez, he raised a lot of demons. This situation is not better. We may lose this battle… How about us? Can we help? Please. We were fools when we were alive. We were cheated when we were ghosts. Now we want to take the wheel of our destiny. Don't make a move, guys. You are all just ordinary spirits. You can never fight against my demons. Me! Gosh, it's Vu! Why are you here? Always in need. It's very dangerous. Do you know that anyone who steps into this circle, will never get out of it? Don't worry. I have my own way when I decided to come here. My friends! Oh, you're all here. Let you all gather here. I'm going to end this tonight. - Go! - Go! You're all far too aggressive. What's happening? Miss… I can't see anything. You're human so you can't see it. Miss… Seal of Fire and Air. Tight encirclement. What's wrong? He's using hellfire to burn everything down. Vu! Oh my gosh! Vu! Vu! Vu! Lien Thanh! Let's get everyone up here. The more people there are, the faster will we destroy his dead lands boundary. - Hurry up! - Got it! Miss. What am I supposed to do? Oh my goodness, my son… are you all right? Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Thuy Du! Everything's clear! You win. Please stop it! A pair of baby booties can't knock me down. Soul-banishing rod! SPELLS Don't! You know, with just one strike from this soul-banishing rod, your spirit will be slowly dispersed. You dare? Hit me! Don't do it to Tinh Lam! He's innocent. Get out! You betrayed me so many times. And you still think that I will forgive you? You could just hit me. It's all my fault… Alright! That's your choice. Don't blame me for being cruel! Tinh Lam! If I can find someone to save your eyes, will you follow me? Gosh, this is ridiculous! I can see your future. It's very bright. That's life. Things aren't always the way they seem. On the button, it's always written "for the visually impaired." SPELLS Mind expansion spell. SOUL REPRESSION SPELL SOUL EXPULSION SPELL SOUL RECALL Please stop hitting me! Where is this place? Dream land. And the person you just hit… is yourself! Wrong. I just hit Tinh Lam, little bastard. Tinh Lam was also your reflection back in the day… Honest and pure. But for me, he is a seed of catastrophe. Tinh Lam was like you, but he'll never be you, who became a catastrophe. Why? Tell me? Because Tinh Lam has Thien Tam in him. I don't believe it! Never! Who are you? Tinh Lam. Are you actually trying to hypnotize me with your spells? I am Ngo Duc Thien Tam. Flashback of Tinh Lam's previous life. Liar! I'm Tinh Lam, Uncle. Uncle Ut! Ut Quai, you achieved what you wanted. But the wickedness in your heart has changed you. You better stop before it's too late. No! I'm the best shaman! He can't be better than me! Have you ever experienced the feeling of being despised by the people in your family? Have you ever experienced the shame as everyone neglected your attempts? I've been through all these kinds of thing… all alone… and in the cold, dark heart of many people. I tried so hard… to get what I have today. He can't take it away from me. No! Please, Uncle Ut. The goodness is rooted from our heart. Having a good heart is much more precious than having a talent. No! I got to destroy him! The wickedness in his heart still persists. If so… follow me into the Refinement World. Get off me! Uncle Ut! - Let go of me! - Uncle Ut! I'm waiting… for the day you come back. Hey, Nhi… Do you believe that spiritualism got everyone into these situations? I don't. These things simply don't exist. I think that you believe it. Just because you don't want to talk about it. Am I right? We all have different views. I choose my own way so that I could live a peaceful life. So tell me what's wrong with them? Here. Take a look. Breaking news at 1:30 a.m. A fire broke out at an abandoned junkyard in the Westside of the city. According to reports, there are no human casualties but as this is a junkyard which contains lots of plastic waste, it's spewing poison into the air on a massive scale. Some people are in a coma as a result of inhaling the gas. Next, financial news. It's true that God has arranged this whole thing. But that it is in the past. Thanks a lot, Nhi. Don't mention it. Phuoc! Phuoc! Are you alright? How do you feel? I don't know what you were going through last night. I was frightened. I was panicking. You're all good? It's okay. It's okay now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I never looked out for you. I never looked out for my mother. I just pulled all types of crap. I was too scared last night. I'm so sorry. I promise I'll drop it. I will stay at home… Mom… Don't be sorry. Change is good. Yes, I will change… I will change… How do you feel? Are you hurt? We have a warrant for Nguyen Huu Phuoc's arrest, he tested positive for meth. We expect your cooperation. How could you be involved with drugs? Phuoc! Mom! I'm sorry. Please wait for me. Phuoc! My son! My son! What can I do now? It's my fault. I didn't raise him well. I'm not a good mother. Looking back, I still see life is operated by karma and causality. My parents once told me that I should find Thien Tam. This is not something sophisticated and farfetched. Thien Tam… also means goodness and life's simple pleasures. No matter what losses we have suffered, we will grow from them. No matter how your life turns out, just live with the goodness that you own. Then you will see everything in life… will get better. Liar! Uncle Ut! It hurts. I got bruises… Uncle Ut! Uncle Ut! Alright, I'm sorry. It's like we have a baby. You planning on staying here? As Uncle Ut is here, how can I leave? No matter what, we're still family. Fresh spring rolls are here! Coming! So delicious! Time to eat! God, that is so good! Eat! Let's eat. Give me food! Let me give you some. You like pancakes? Here, for you. Eat more vegetables. For you. I don't know where Vu is. If you have an epiphany, please come here and join us. Let's eat, Uncle Ut! It's a duck. Uncle! Wrong! A duck is not that big. It's a sparrow. Nonsense! Tinh Lam! I'm sorry for the pain that I caused you. Even the misunderstanding… If you weren't there, I would never have seen Nguyet Thi again. Thank you all so much. It's no big deal. If we were destined to meet, I will even help for nothing. Without predestination, I won't help even you offer me all the treasures. Oops, I forgot. Mr. Tinh Lam! Mr. Tinh Lam! There's a doll ghost at the junkyard. Let's eat! So that you have enough energy. The path ahead is yours now.
