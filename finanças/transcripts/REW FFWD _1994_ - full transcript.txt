(tires screeching) (whipping) (dog crying) - [Voiceover] For God's sake, what's that? - [Voiceover] Now, can you explain to me why you put a dead dog on the front cover? - [Voiceover] This is a black box. - [Voiceover] I'm your psychiatrist, mechanic. - [Voiceover] Pardon? - [Voiceover] You're the protagonist of a broken down road movie. Therefore, you need a psychiatrist, mechanic. - [Voiceover] This is a psycho-drama. This is your black box. (speaking in French) It belongs to the Periscope Magazine Corporation, an imaginary company. - [Voiceover] You are a paparazzi looking for Ms. World 1976 in Kingston, Jamaica. - [Voiceover] This black box contains all the memory of your last expedition. It digitally recorded every move, every thought, every breath, everything. You've been traumatized by a special experience. In the front, four buttons. Let's push play. (sucking) - Yeah, that good. Yeah, man. Boys, that's right. - [Voiceover] Well, we must rewind the tape. - Yeah, man, good thing for everybody, you know. - [Voiceover] Um, I one day I hope psychiatrically I can be helped to stop smoking. - [Voiceover] Okay, now, why do you want to stop smoking? - [Voiceover] Because I-- - [Voiceover] There it is. The opening of the psycho-drama. Just at the beginning of the end. - [Voiceover] Right, now, some people argue that the circumference of a cigarette is the same as the circumference of a female nipple, and that what you're doing is satisfying your desire to be breast-fed. - [Voiceover] Boy, I wish I could do that as much as I smoke. - [Voiceover] No sleeping allowed since three days, you're lost. You must find your hotel, your septic universe. Did you find Ms. World 1976? - [Voiceover] This is not your world. You don't want to get into contact with it. You must not get into contact with it. That's all you have in mind. That's what everybody told you to think. - [Voiceover] No choice. Stop the movement. The doors are locked. Nothing can happen to you. (bird calling) - [Voiceover] Hallucinations due to active paranoia. Dreams, watch out. You're ready to wake up in three seconds. One, two, three. Contact. (grating) (pounding) - Hey, man. What's up, man. - [Voiceover] Do you feel panic? - [Voiceover] Interesting. (grating) - [Voiceover] Pardon me? - [Voiceover] This man, you should follow this man. - What do you mean, what's the problem? - [Voiceover] No problem. Everything is okay. - Stay calm man, we're cool. - [Voiceover] The car seems dead. While you were dreaming about a potential pelican, someone had stolen a piece of your engine. The man said to you, "Get out of your car, "follow me, man." - [Voiceover] Mike also said, "I know a man who can help you." And you got out of your submarine, and you followed him. Very interesting. How do you feel about this? - [Voiceover] You're calm, nervous at the same time. The universe around you looks like a bombed town. It's like a hurricane just passed by a few minutes ago. Your car didn't stop in a normal place. You must be very careful. You're walking on the border of the eye of your storm. You're in the middle of Trench Town. Talk to me about the storm. (hissing) - Yeah, man, that's Stewart. This is the mechanic, he can handle everything. - Hey, now. Good afternoon, sir. I'm Hector Stewart, pleased to meet you. - [Voiceover] He'll take a look at your car tomorrow afternoon. Please focus, remember. - [Voiceover] Don't miss it, I'm at the market. - [Voiceover] Not so loud, you might wake yourself up. You're in the headquarters of the Periscope Magazine Corporation, a few days before your departure. What are you doing there? - [Voiceover] Why? - Now you have to be very careful. This country's only 30 years old. A teenager. By the way, half the island is under 18. A third of the population is under the step of extreme poverty, the scale of violence is comparable to the worst parts of Los Angeles. These people have no respect for life. - [Voiceover] Now we can come back to your car with more perspective. - [Voiceover] And he answered, Trench Town. - [Voiceover] Right in the middle of it. Why are you so afraid? - Now, in that country, you never open your doors, you always keep your doors locked. You never roll down your windows, and always wear a seat belt, in case you need to take evasive action. If you're followed, you must never go home. If you're seriously concerned for your personal safety, do not hesitate to drive on sidewalks, against opposing lanes of traffic or even through traffic lights. You never get out of your vehicle, and always bring a few spare parts for your vehicle. In some areas, spare parts aren't very hard to obtain. You must not drive in areas of known danger, and if you have an accident in those areas, do not stop. You must never drive alone, and if you are accosted, do not resist. - [Voiceover] Hmm, you're more traumatized than I thought. - [Voiceover] Concentrate, now. You must associate the image of your car with the dog. Bring the dog and the car to life. Good. Alma Mockyen will begin to speak in three seconds. - [Voiceover] The voice. - Now, the problem seems to be to keep things in balance. We want to hold on to some of the spirituality of the life we knew when we were largely rural-oriented folk. We didn't necessarily live in the country, but our lives were the simple lives of rural people. And we want not to lose that. We want not to lose the friendliness that you find in families even today, which is why, when an overseas researcher comes here, he can see that we have something to offer at family level, where it's just people relating to people in a close association. - [Voiceover] The room. - [Voiceover] Mike says to you, "You can stay the night." He says that the mechanic will take a look at your car tomorrow. He says that you're their guest, and then invites you to go with them, talk with his friends. - [Voiceover] Why? - [Voiceover] You want to kill time like a dog on a road. (radio chatter) - [Voiceover] Asking confirmation for landing, over. - [Voiceover] Ground control to November 29, we give you the okay for landing. The day is over, I repeat, the day is over. You can begin your landing procedures, over. - [Voiceover] November 29, ground control well received for landing in 45 seconds, over and out. - [Voiceover] You see? You're creating your own psycho-drama. You're the director. Remember the dog and the car. Shut up. You direct your own reality. Reality is not celluloid. Open the light and go inside. Exit the frame. - [Voiceover] November 29 is over. Over and out. - [Voiceover] Stop your cinema. Wake up. (rooster calling) (rooster calling) - [Voiceover] And from 2000 radios, you're hearing the voice on air. - [Voiceover] How do we say to ourselves, as well as to people coming in, understand the person behind the broad nose or the straight nose or the slanted eyes or the straight hair follicle or the kinky hair follicle, or whatever. The harder it is for you to identify with the person you are seeing, the more you tend to put distance between yourself and them. And that, too, is influx. That too is changing, and again, my thesis is how do we keep this thing in balance? - [Voiceover] Do you trust him? - [Voiceover] Why did you start to teach? - [Voiceover] Now, we're ready to go much further. It has been nine days since you're there and you're still alive. Your car's not fixed yet. The mechanic, Mr. Stewart, is too busy building his own car. He says to you, "Soon, come." The rhythm slowly begins to appeal to you. During those days, your attention has been attracted by a very strange man. He's always in the background. Always somewhere, hidden on the set. So you decide to watch him with your 250mm lens.

(speaking in foreign language) - [Voiceover] Without warning, you find yourself right in the middle of one of their famous philosophical discussions. - [Voiceover] Your car begins to fit in the scenery. - [Voiceover] Keep your mental car in movement. Remember. - The notion of efficiency doesn't even exist there. Do you understand? Now, you have to work on the occidental speed in African laziness. I know what I'm talkin' about, boy, I spent nine years of my life in Africa. Oh, it's a fascinating land. My childhood dreams. Africa is where mankind was born. Africa belongs to the early beginning of life. The African landscape grabs your soul, boy. Like wings in the air. This human hell is a paradise for photography. - [Voiceover] You decide to do what you're supposed to do. Shoot pictures. - [Voiceover] Photography gives you the opportunity to get closer and closer. This man may be the key to your problem. You decide to follow him. - [Voiceover] He can help you. Trust me. (creaking) He's an engineer. A car engineer. - Most of these books I found in the (mumbling). And I see that it was good enough to read, so I tried to put them together. A lot of it has been destroyed. And I see if I can, you know. Put all of. That was not properly registered in the book. But, on paper for myself. I've been studying engineering, right, but at a different level. I've been studyin' transmissions, like differentials and things like that. - [Voiceover] But how can you repair a manual of instruction? - Well, the only thing you can do is like take what's on this and put on that. Like some of these, now. This one, right. You don't exactly know the word here, but you could surmise it, if you can think hard enough. Why should that be there? - [Voiceover] This man just gave you the key. - [Voiceover] One of the many African retentions which have stayed with us in the Caribbean, in the diaspora, I would say, is the concept of the extended family. Family doesn't necessarily have to be somebody related to you by blood ties. It's a people who live in the same yard with you, it's people who share maybe property with you. And that extended family concept has held our societies together for a long time. Now what is happening, is that the extended family, for a variety of reasons, is perhaps suffering a sea change. Take a pivotal person in the extended family, the grandmother. The matriarchal figure. We often speak of a mother who fathered me. Well this grandmother is now becoming a younger person. The year-on system, about which a lot has been written in our society, that is where people live in a specific areas, and when the parents of one group are not there, they look after all the children and so on, and they pass on values to their children. Not necessarily your children. Your extended family. Well, this grandmother as I see is becoming much younger. She's in the labor force much longer, she's not there anymore to help teach the children in this big yard household the values that are necessary for social cohesion. Yes, we are, very much a society in change, in flux. Now, the Jamaican woman still has or may in fact be the mother of many children by different fathers. She is the strong, central figure. She has to be, she has to scratch and scrape to keep that family alive. * This is myself and it's attractive * 'Cause this is myself * And he so active * Oh so wonderful * Oh so beautiful * Oh so wonderful * Said oh so beautiful * So carumba * So carumba * Said aruba de Babylon * Macopana irie liquor daughter * It was a sexy liquor daughter * Lord and when she start to rock with him * The only thing it put the (mumbling) * Is what * You never knew love like this before * Said he want some more * Come on don't you give him some more * Because he never * Knew love like this before * Said he want some more * Come on don't you give him some more * Sing, hear this. * So, carumba * Said aruba de Babylon * Aruba de Babylon (speaking in foreign language) * So carumba Higher, higher! * So carumba Higher! * So carumba Listen to me, now. * Carumba de Babylon * Arumba de Babylon * Bacapana irie liquor daughter * Bacapana irie liquor daughter * - [Voiceover] The engineer is taking a look at your car. - [Voiceover] What do you expect to find in Africa? - [Voiceover] What do you see in those eyes? Answer me. - [Voiceover] The winds of the storm are coming back. We're beginning to get out of her eye. You hear the kerosene angels leaving the ground. Your dogs return. Your fear of dogs is coming back. Everything is coming back. How do you feel? - [Voiceover] What do you see in those eyes? (chattering) - [Voiceover] A month later and you're out of there. - [Voiceover] Keep the dog in the car alive. Concentrate. - [Voiceover] Don't lose your concentration.
