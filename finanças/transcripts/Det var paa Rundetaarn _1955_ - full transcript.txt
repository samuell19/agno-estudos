As you can see, we have to go up high. I don't need to tell you that we are at the top of the Round Tower. We stare out at the town's pretty towers. Most of us have been here before. Preferably Wednesday or Saturday, when there is free entry. Let's look down on the streets. You will be surprised that you do not see a single person. The explanation is straightforward. It is Sunday morning at around 6 o'clock. People are still in their deepest slumber. They have no idea that it is a delightful morning, - - and that the sun has gilded the city's roofs. They will protest and say that this only happens in movies. But it is a film, and there you are allowed to embellish things. Like I said, it's early so we have time to look around a bit. The weather is clear, so we can see the skyscrapers out on Bellahoj. Let's get closer so we can see a skyscraper. On the top floor, we look in at the district court prosecutor Hartsen. We find him fast asleep with his sweet wife by his side. Did I say sweet? Maybe... but damn, how they argued before they fell sleep. The lady blamed her woman-dear husband for his behavior - - At the Supreme Court prosecutor something or other. She is...let's entrust you with that right away, very jealous and combative. While we let them sleep in peace, we will show you another, smaller house. And the widow Hald lives there. She sleeps safely. She has a small annuity after her husband, - - who had taken out a beautiful life insurance policy. and she has two sweet daughters: Johanne and Grete. Did I say sweeet again? You can also say pretty. Isn't it a shame to wake them up now? Then we are back at the Round Tower and look down on the city - - with its narrow streets. T hey will ask: Does everyone sleep in this movie?... No, don't worry! Over there under the roof, someone is about to wake up. I'd better introduce him to you since you will see more of him. His name is Lasse Larsen and he is a seasonal worker. He brings Christmas trees to town so it's a short season. But he knows how to adjust himself for the breaks. No, it's almost a shame. So, now it can go straight up. Look at him now; he is on his way to his bench in one of the city's parks. Here he enjoys himself and eats the day's meals. But for now let's leave him alone. It's past 8 o'clock. So you can wake people up, right? In the old quarter, Mrs Hambro lives on the 3rd floor. She makes a living by renting out rooms. So now the phone rang. Then I'd better keep quiet. Yes, it is Mrs. Hambro personally. Am I awake? Do you think I talk in my sleep? It's a good time to wake people up! If two musicians live here? Yes, it certainly does. Anything inappropriate in that? Do they have to take the test again at 11, on a Holy Sunday? Was it in such a rush to call when it wasn't until 11? I'd better say it while I remember. Hello, you two, wake up. There is a telephone. - There's coffee. - What coffee? - Is there coffee? - God there isn't, but nothing else will wake you. An idiot called and said you have to go to the test at 11 o'clock. - What time is it? - Just over 8. 8...?! Are you crazy, Mrs. Hambro! - When do you have to be woken up? - Not a single minute before 10. Good morning, girls. Here is tea and spices. - What time is it? - It is 8.30. - Oh, murder, it's Sunday! - It's such lovely weather. - Wake up and get a little out of the day. - At Thorvaldsen's museum? - No. Go to Bellevue and go in the water. - No, there are many people. We go further up the coast. And you have to go, mom. No, Aunt Olga is coming for coffee. But I'll make you a packed lunch. - Then we have to leave before too many on train. - Wear the bathing suit under the dress. - Bring a dry one. - We stay in the sun until we are dry. (the phone is ringing) - Hello... - The Reserve phone, morning, it is 9 o'clock. It must be a mistake. I don't have a phone. I live in the countryside. Yes, it must have been high yesterday. - Who was it? - The spare phone. They claimed it's 9 o'clock. Where are you going? We usually sleep a long time. - Viggo, why don't you answer? - Now get out of the feathers. - No, why so? - I have an idea. We go up to Horncreek and have lunch. - The new wagon must be driven to. - Oh, how sneaky you are. You know very well that I cannot come along. It's mom's birthday. You bought her chocolate yourself yesterday. - It was a sloppy box. - It cost DKK 30. You knew very well that I couldn't come. - Then you have made another agreement. - With whom? - With Ms. Hansen, that straitjacket. - No, but she is very sweet. Now get dressed and come along. When I go to bed at 3, I can't get up at 9. Are you going to forget your ring again? Going out and playing the bachelor? I take it off while I shower! It's just a matter of getting it off, - - so that there is no mark on the finger. - So stop it! - No! I want to know the message. - Do you want sun on your ring finger? - Shut your trap before you get sunburned. You stay at home and follow me to mom to congratulate her! Should I stay home in this weather because it's your mother's rudeless birthday? That wagon needs to be driven to, and today I have time. - Do it tomorrow! - I have my work to look after. Alright, I'll pick you up at your mom's at 3. 2 o'clock...! At 3 o'clock. The carriage must be driven slowly. Goodbye My friend. Oh no. Now he has that scoundrel left the ring. We register the bikes for Elsinore. It is nice that there are not too many people yet. Good morning. It was a nice car though. - When did you get it? - Yesterday. - Now I'm going up along the coast. - Isn't your wife coming? - No, we got home late last night. - Yes, we heard that. 3 o'clock. Goodbye, Mr High Court Prosecutor, and have a good trip. - Thorvald! - Yes, Elisabeth, now I'm coming. (slams the door with a bang) I thought someone was shooting. I guess you don't need to list in your own house in the afternoon. - What time is it? - 10:30 a.m. They would wake us up at 10! I don't hang by the bell-string. - Up with you, it's 11. - Who? The clock! Mrs. Hambro forgot to wake us up. - I woke you up at 8. - We are not going on a night maneuver! - Then come up with you. - Not when Mrs. Hambro is there. They must go at last, Mrs. Hambro. He is so shy. New he sleeps god help me again! Stop it! I am awake! Could I be allowed to drive with you? Just up the coast. I'm going to Horncreek. Just get on. I'm in love, I've fallen for a nice car very last style what a profile come on, my own we're going to have the first Sunday trip out on the country road, saying goodbye to the city's cage off today, lovely weather sweet girls in sunshine-clothes give a song, you little starling sing to the wagon and me south and north, east and west, out there is the very best when the fresh summer breeze kisses the carriage and me I could dance here behind the wheel right up to Kattegat who can be cold and composed when it's all so nice nice road, good space, you should give it more gas Nah, now it's comfortable, the carriage whispers to me we belong together, we will follow through thick and thin all modern decoration it has cost coin look where it smiles it was love at first sight because I love cars like toddlers love candy o nice car, new and nice ah, we are feeling so good now the sky smiles pale blue down at the carriage and me everything goes, fine and smooth, I can drive day and night like a little< /i> cuddly cat the cart purrs for me is there jazz on the radio chamber-jammer from the oboe let's enjoy the peace we have enough to look at speed up, speed down you and I know good news it' the great love between the wagon and me. It was refreshing. Thank you for taking care of the cart. - Don't you want a dip? - I'll settle for the ice cream. There's too much power for me out there. - Here you go. - Good thing you didn't run with it. There is quite a small fortune in it. The company money. Ran with it? I was supposed to take care of it. Anyway. There is enough money to get a few small wishes fulfilled. I have always wanted a small well-stocked fruit cart. A whole little greengrocer with some smart signs that shine. And then on a really good road. I have often saved up and put shilling upon shilling aside. But every time it was about to be there, it is always swiped. Otherwise, I was looking forward to it. Yes, we all have a worm that gnaws. I have to wear clothes. Do you want to go north? No, I'll stay around here. Thanks for the ride. Look, it's nice there. Let's go down here. There aren't that many people. (they laugh) Will you take my hat? - You must excuse that. - I said trial at 11 o'clock. - It is now 11.30. You should be able to be here when we can. - We were woken up way too late. - I called at 8 o'clock. - Do you think we are sleepwalkers?! - Here is the new song. - We have learned it by heart. - Our bikes have been stolen. - Impossible. - Someone must be laughing at us. - Let's look for them. We go back down to the beach and think about it. The prize bond! It was also in the bag. We saved for two months to get that. Why didn't you leave it at home? It was stupid of me, but I forgot to take it out. These two are going to Easterport Station. There must not be a bicycle basket on it, Mr. - Do you have any tickets? - Here. - Two are needed. - I have that too. Here you go. - How much is it? - DKK 3 and 20 ore. Come on, you two. We'll try it right through with you. I like good music, it can make me so quick but today I'm like a rag before a schlager knocked me out no matter where I go there is someone playing it the first time it was quite sweet but now it has made me soft it hangs in my ear the damn melody it sounds in one drive it buzzes like a bee I got it into the head last night at 9 o'clock and before I fully understood it I was singing along, because it hangs in my ear the damn melody NewHarbor, it's no for itself, but it's also some for me it's so nice to walk here, but wear your roller clothes sailors sing New Harbor's price, it is Dannevang's Paris jump down in a cellar neck and then you get a waltz it hangs in my ear the little melody it wreaks havoc indoors and outdoor in the free there is nothing to be done about that epidemic and you'll go crazy, that's for sure it hangs in my ear the little melody May I ask for a bit of culture Mozart, it's one that lasts or Schubert, Chopin and Grieg, it is the most beautiful music down with everything that is colored, worse I have never heard but if you want to be popular, yes, then you give this one it hangs in my ear my ear, my ear, my ear the little melody but I'd rather hear, yes hear, yes hear, yes hear the 5th symphony But do I want to avoid the pain, yes the pain, yes the pain, yes the pain of people's antipathy then I finish the concert the concert, the concert, the concert with it that you like it hangs in my ear The daaaaaammn melody jazz and hot and swing and bop it's good for soul and body da-di-da-bop a skidli we there must be rhythm in it Armstrong with his golden trumpet everyone has heard and seen and with joy it almost hurts when his record runs around it hangs in my ear, baby skiddeli-biddeli-bop and ushers and drivers take the refrain non-stop and tram conductors yes, they sing while driving people jump out of doors and many hit a traffic jam - it hangs in my ear - yes, it hangs in your ear - the sweet little fool - da-da-du-du-da-du-dum - It's hanging in my ear - yes, it's hanging in the ear - It's hanging in my ear - well, it's still hanging the sweet little fool - yes, that stupid tune. - yeah...! - There is a car coming. - As long as there is room in it. Come. (honk) - Ladies, may I come by? - Can we ride along? Yes, I'll wait until you've got your clothes on. We have none. It's stolen. Can we come anyway? Yes of course. Someone has stolen our clothes and our bikes. That was sad. They can ride with me. Sit in the front seat. In the back seat you die of cold. Then there is a fifteen-minute break. - Something to drink? - A Court and a Tuborg. Bon appetite. Can any of you gentlemen use a lottery ticket? - No thanks. - We have no money. It is otherwise cheap. - What is that? - A premium bond. It sounds like it costs 50 crowns, and you should get it for par. - What is par? - Yes... that it is murderously cheap. It is sold at a premium like this one. There will soon be a draft. You can win 200,000. Try and see the number there. Number 2991. Serial number 936. Yes, it is good enough. - Is there any luck with that number? - Yes, 2991, serial number 936. It's the best number. Add the sum across. - So what do you get? - Headache. No, then you get 39.0 And 3 times 13 is also 39. Can't you see it must come out. - Why do you want to get rid of it? - I am in an embarrassment. I don't have time to wait for the big win. It is one of the curses of poverty that you never... 50 crowns is a lot of money. I have 25. - I don't want to sell it for that. - Then ask if he has 25 kroner. - I don't have 25 crowns. - May I look you in the eye? Well, maybe I have 25 crowns after all. Now it brightens. Come on...I'd like to write the number down. It's funny if you won and I had sold it. Of course we win. Why else should we buy it? Can I borrow the pencil here? - 2991, serial number 936. - And serial number 936. Will you take care of it? ...Uh, uh, uh! I'll take care of that. Too bad your bikes were stolen. - The police must do something. - No, not without the numbers. - We bought them used. - You can write down the numbers. If I can be of any help to you, come up to my office. - Would you please fill it up? - Just a moment, Mr. Oh good day, Mr High Court Prosecutor. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes, thank you, excellent. Now I understand why his wife didn't want to go. I think you should look around for another lawyer, Thorvald. I'll see you tonight. Driver, drive for the open carriage there. - No, there is a red light. - It is also too late now. - Thanks for the ride. - We haven't taken up your time, have we? No, I'm just going to my mother-in-law's birthday chocolates, so like the delay. - It will be nice to get dressed. - Thank you for your kindness. It's me who gives thanks for the company. They have my office address, - - if there is anything I can help with. Nah, mom, that's the rudest thing! I guess you'll get an explanation when he comes. He would be here at 2 o'clock. It is almost 3 o'clock now. Yes, there he is. He comes as naughty as usual. Now be sensible and don't smash too much. Break? Do you think it's funny to be married to a skirt hunter? It is the drop that makes the cup overflow. Flow over... I have to go to the chocolate. I don't want to witness this here either. I would also prefer to carry out the execution alone. South and north, east and west outside are the very best. When the fresh summer breeze kisses the carriage and me. - You see, I'm precise. - That was nice. Come on in. - Where is your mother? - In the kitchen. I have promised to set the table. - Well, did you have a good trip? - Yes, the carriage went splendidly. I also kept the speed down. It was sensible. Yes, you don't have to get carried away. - What do you mean by that? - Nothing. - Did you experience anything interesting? - Yes, the weather was nice. - Very intriguing. Did you meet someone you knew? - Nah. - Or someone you didn't know? - It cannot be avoided. It's not human vacant. - Were you alone the whole time? - Yes of course. - Didn't you have anyone in the car? - Nah. Are you completely sure? You often come across surprises. Stop that lashing! - Now listen, Kirsten. - Thanks, I've heard enough. Couldn't you ask your girlfriends to put on a little more clothes? May I explain. It is quite harmless. Your concepts are different from mine. Who did you get it from? It's probably Mrs Hejresen. Do you think you can drive around with 2 nude girl without it being tossed around? It's not as bad as you think. If I had to introduce one word… That's redundant... What's the name of the lawyer you can't stand? - Andersen! That's a nasty fellow. - Then he can bring the case against you for cheating. - It's too ridiculous! - Yes, I've been ridiculous. But he who laughs last, laughs best. I'm staying here with mother. - Let me explain though! - Save it for the courtroom. Be happy, you will get your freedom. And please go away. - You show me the door?! - Yes! There you go. There it is. - I'm not going until... - Get out or I'll scream! - Well... - (she screams loudly) We move on to the draw, it is the main prize of DKK 200,000. Serial number 2991. Number 936. How do you know that it is your bond that has come out? It has the same number as Johanne's birthday. - It is September 29, 1936. - Now you have to see, mother. On 29/9/1936. That's why we bought it. We would never have bought it if we hadn't been offered that number. Grete said:"There must be luck with that number, Johanne since it's your brithday!" You must go up to the Minister of Finance and assert your claim. After all, we don't have the bond. Nah, but we can ask them not to pay out the money. Then we have a chance to catch them. Explain how it was stolen and state it with the date. Then I take Johanne's birth certificate with me. I am sure they will help you and believe what you say. You are a pair of nice girls. (dance music is heard) - And then ladies - And gentlemen. - We want to ask those couples... - There are in the competition - About reporting to the inspector. r - Where they'll get a number. - In the meantime... - We want to do a little number, right? My poor heart needs love You're not really smart only choruses are sung in American it is the language of the whole world - will you give me love? - will you give me permission? - Darling, you'll be mine in heaven - in the garden - here you see the skies - here is your last dough - life will be so beautiful at seven - for the soap happiness us somewhere is calling they have almost summer weather in Kolding - will you give me love? - will you give me permission? - Come in my garden - come in with the garden - This is our honey moon - honey mouth. (clap) Then we ask the participants in the competition - - about standing up... - Yes. (music begins) We have won. We have won... we have won! Yes... yes, we have won. Yes...! Cheers...!!! Good morning, my girl. Well, did you sleep well? I haven't closed an eye. I am completely devastated. But I'm not going home. He will not have that triumph. Don't be stubborn. You are weak in a divorce. - You have left table and bed. - I had a good reason! Infidelity. He drove around with two half-naked girls. It's stupidity. Not adultery. - You have no proof. - I can have that. With the help of a detective agency. Mom, give me the phone book. - Will you let your husband shadow? - Yes. Viggo doesn't keep to himself when he's finally on his own ballpark. Better put a line over the whole thing. You care about him. Of course. That's why it creeps me out. I don't close my eyes and ears and take revenge by bypassing it. Here it is... Now you have to see. Detective agencies. What a lot. Shadows, marriages deepest discretion. It sounds good. Detective agency Argus. Yes, dear madam, I am aware of it all. Morale is not what it used to be. This is the man who takes your case. It is Mr. Duus, and it is Mrs. High Court prosecutor Hartsen. The wife wants her husband shadowed. A shadow case? Comfortable in the heat wave. Here is a photograph of my husband. - Lovely person. - Yes, a youth picture. His business card with the business address. The private residence is: At Bellahoj 138, upstairs. - Where do I submit a report? - Call my mother, Mrs. Holm. We would like to explain that we have premium bond 2991, - - serial number 936, which has been drawn with DKK 200,000. - Congratulations. - Unfortunately, the bond has been stolen from us. - They don't have the bond? - Nah, it was stolen from us. Can you not refrain from paying out the money, - - before we are notified? Then the police can catch the thief. A premium bond is bearer paper. Will you let us know if anyone shows up? If the premium bond is not presented within 3 years, - - and you can prove that you were the owner of it, - - then it is possible to get it paid out. - It will not be easy to prove. - We have your birth certificate Nah, it doesn't help. Maybe you can provide a receipt? We could go up to the High Court prosecutor who helped us. It never hurts. 200,000 is a lot of money. That was also devilish! You damned mutt! steal someone else's food! It was a pleasant surprise. Go ahead and take a seat. Is there anything I can be of service with? They couldn't give us a good advice, could they? - About the bond that was stolen. - Yes, it's boring. - It's a disaster. - It has come out with 200,000. DKK 200,000! Do you have proof that you had that bond? - Nah... - Then it's not good. We were up in the finance main box... Sorry. Is that Mrs. Hartsen? Mrs. Hartsen?... Aage Duus from the Argus detective agency. I am standing in a kiosk on Merchant street. I just saw two young ladies go up to your husband's office. They were there 1 hour and 18 minutes - - and made a lively impression when they left. Whether they had been drinking?... I can't say that, I wasn't there. Were they beautiful?... They were definitely to my taste. If I wasn't on a diet, then… Sorry. Well, I'll go to my post in front of the office. I follow him like a bloodhound... Wuf-Wuf! (she kicks the door in) - Then we stand up. - Come in. They probably don't know how late it is. There was something important we had to get up for. - It was probably to pay the rent. - No normal person get up for that. (Poul makes strange noises) What is it? - Where am I? - Home. - How have I coped with it? Why are you making noise? - I dreamed I was a donkey. - It's not a dream. It was a nice time you came home. You woke up the whole street. Mrs. Hambro... Thanks. - I found a shoe on the mat. - It is mine. - Have you seen the other one? - You are wearing it. Hans...come here. Godfather be preserved, how do I look. Why would you have changed overnight? I'm so sore right there. How can it be? You tried to see if you could topple the Round Tower. - Oh! Could I? - I do not know. - Mrs Hambro... is Round Tower still there? Yes, damn well it still stands there. - Hans...!!! - Yeah, what's up, human? - We are millionaires! - Yes, there was something we had to get up to. Mrs. Hambro, Mrs. Hambro! We won 200,000. Put your head in cold water. It helps with that kind. We have given a round to all the comrades. We need to get dressed and get the dough. - Do you know where it is? - Yes, in the red building. - Have you ever withdrew anything? - Yes, my engagement. Drink your coffee and you will be sober. - Show her the note. - Where did I do with it? They must not sit there. - We're dwoning in money. Is there anything you want? - That summer must last. It is difficult to guarantee even for a millionaire. They have been nice to us. Isn't there something you really want? Yes, a tiny evening gown. They must get evening robes, morning robes and dinner robes and... They must also get a nightgown... - What's wrong? - The bond is gone. Then we are not millionaires anymore. Then it will be of no use with your robes. - I gave it to you last night. - nonsense, you got it. You also throw everything away. ...What is it? - That's the one...! - Then we are millionaires again. Come, Mrs. Hambro! - They must get an evening gown. - And a dressing gown. And a dressing gown and a dressing gown. - Good day. They want? - We would like to withdraw the profit. Bring the note. Is there something wrong? Should we have worn tuxedos? - No, Can I have your address? - Yes of course. Why? We keep the bond for a few days to test its authenticity. - Do you think we made it ourselves? - It's a matter of form. - Do you pay interest for that long? - No, we deduct 15% in tax. If you run with the bond, we want a receipt. Yes, now you will get it. I don't like departing the note. Miss, can't I stay here tonight? No! They get a receipt when I get name, address, phone number. Hell of a hassle for that some small dime. I knew it! They are crisp-dry. He could have given them some water! What a mess. Men are pigs. 34 76. (the phone is ringing) - Hello? - Good day, mom, it's me. You should see a mess. - Did you manage your curiosity? - I am allowed to get a dress from home! He can't possibly have used all those plates, knives... So, so, three meals a day for 4 days. It makes some mess. I'll stay and do a bit of tidying up. This mess makes me sick. - Now you'd better stay there. - Never in my life...! I won't give in. So sleep here on the couch, even if it's hard. Is it less hard to be a cheated wife? - You have no proof. - No, but just wait, it will come. You know me. I don't helm until I'm sure. (the phone is ringing) Hello?... No it isn't. It's Mrs. Holm. A moment. My daughter just arrived. ...It is for you. Hello... Yes, good morning, Mr. Duus. Now the young ladies are there again. They went up to your husband's office. - Now... after office hours? - Yes. I won't let him out of my sight. No, definitely don't. And call here later. Goodbye. There had been someone to get the bond paid. - Two young people, we agreed there were two who stole. - They didn't get the money, did they? They handed in the bond and got a receipt. - Then they gave up their name and address. - Yes, here. They live with a Mrs. Hambro. Their names are Ramlose and Poul Jensen. Then I want to know who the two are, - - and where they were on Sunday when the theft was committed. 17 21. (the phone is ringing) Hello? Yes, it is. Do you have a Ramlose and Jensen living? And what are they? They're not really all that sane. They sleep all day. Are they home now? When are they coming? The other day they came home at 4. They are probably at Round Tower. Well, a dance restaurant where they play. What kind of place is that? Have no idea. Now I don't have time anymore. I'm in the middle of the meatballs. But... She was a difficult lady. Now you go down to that restaurant, - - where the young people play to look at them first. - Can two young girls go there by themselves? - I would like to come along. Yes, it would be nice. Shouldn't we have a bite to eat in a really nice place first? Do you know a couple of gentlemen who work here: - Ramlose and Jensen. - I do. - How are they? - Wonderful. - How do they look? - Lovely. - Are there any special characteristics? - One is long, one is small. One plays the accordion and the other the trombone. - Won't you put down your hat, sir? - Yes, and the tie, it will likely be hot. - Weatherly. - Here you go. Thank you very much. Is there nothing more you want to put? - Yes, the jacket a little later. - Oh, just bring it. Nice young man. - Can I borrow a phone? - Yes, it's over there. 34 76. (the phone is ringing) - Hello? - Yes, it's Duus. I am at the Round Tower restaurant. Your husband is here with the two young ladies. Wait for me. I will take a carriage and come at once. - What kind of restaurant is it? - Folk with swing and jazz. Yes, I understand. Goodbye. It's probably the two in the middle. How rude to pretend like nothing. If I had stolen that money, I wouldn't have cried out either. - They may have a good conscience. - When it comes to 200,000?! - Nah, they look sneaky. - Now don't look at the dog's hair. But they look sneaky. 1 dish... 1 dish... - Mother, do you want to get a cart? - What do you look like?! Mr Duus called while you were in the kitchen. Viggo sits on a dance floor and fools around with the two girls. - Where did you get those clothes from? - From my teenage years, a combo of everything. If I'm going to spy on Viggo, I have to look like the others. - Please call for a carriage. - Yes. Yes. Let's dance up and have a look at them. Look at her there, she's looking at you. - No, how rude he is! - Yes. That's kind of the real thing, huh? - Good evening. - Good evening. - Is my husband here yet? - Is it Mrs. Hartsen? Magnificant disguise. I didn't recognize you again. I'd rather be unrecognizable too, right? Your husband dances. We must be careful and wait. (the music stops) Strange how the tall one stares at me. Does he recognize me? I only had a bathing suit on. I would know you again even without a bathing suit. It's the cheekiest thing though! Think, right up to my open eyes. He is, after all, a double person. I'm going to have to put cold water in his blood! - Come on, now the two of us are going to dance. - With considerable pleasure. Will you dance with me? I want to look at them too. Yeah, that should cool him off with that ice. See him there. He can dance, huh? - He's probably a foreigner. - Yes, or not really smart. - The woman he's dancing with is you. - Yes, it is me. Nooooo! How well you danced! Was it Argentinian? No, chills. A chill ran down my spine as we danced. - We have to get hold of the two guys. - I ask them to come here. He will probably conduct the orchestra. Excuse me, gentlemen, you don't feel like coming down to our table, do you? - With the greatest pleasure. - Play a waltz in the meantime. - What does he want now? - Yes, he might know them. - Poul Jensen. - Hans Ramlose. - The Hald sisters. - Well, the two Half sisters! Go ahead and sit down. How did you get that bond, - - which has come out with DKK 200,000? - We bought it. - Last Sunday. - On a walk in the woods? - Here in the restaurant. - By a man who came in here. - We didn't know him. - And he came in here? - Yes, at 1-2 p.m. - Can you prove it? - Yes, the orchestra was here. It was the goddess of luck. - That sounds strange. - It sounds like hell. This entire matter will be investigated. That bond belongs to the two young ladies. It was stolen from them on Sunday in Horncreek. We have bought the note, so it must be ours. - It was stolen from us! - Can you prove the note is yours? No, you have to take our word for it. Many could say that the bond is theirs. We must have a proof. We have to get up and play on. What time is it? - Yes, it's... oh... - You must excuse that. Goodbye. - A shame we couldn't hear them. - My husband has made a fool of himself! Come on, let's go. - Goodbye, little miss. - Thanks...!!! Can I pay. - You know what? - Don't disturb me. They just found a corpse in the dresser. Do you know what I have? Guilt of conscience. - About the two girls. - Why? After all, it may be true that that bond is hot. - That it is a stolen item. - It's not us who stole it. We are a fence if we know it belonged to the girls. How do we know that? - Because they say so. - It doesn't have to be true. Why would they lie. They are two sweet young girls. - Especially the one. - No, the one who was looking at me. Nah, she must have an eye condition. The second one was much sweeter. - Where can I get a 9? - On the King's New Square. I'm talking about solitaire. We don't need to give them 200,000 cause we like them. It's lame. To behave nicely? I'm going to suggest we share. Then there are 100,000 for us. It's money too, isn't it? Then we behaved decently. Yes, that sounds reasonable... Where do we get the girls? I have the address. I have called the district court prosecutor. - Are you so hot for the girl? - It's not that. - Let's hurry. - Are you so hot for girl? - The milkman is the killer. - Now why did you say that? - I'll burn it tomorrow. - You're not sick. Yes, we are. We are not in the mood to tell you that "that hat suits you". You can take care of your work even by you have hardship. - It'll be alright. - Yes, I'm waiting for the money post! Aren't the musicians who stole it? Then they should also have stolen our bikes. And that is out of the question. They have witnesses that they were in town. The tall one did not look like a thief. - Not the other one either! - The one with the underbite? No, a strong chin. It is a sign of character. - A bad character - It rings. It's the money post! No, it's Aunt Olga. She promised to look over. Good day, madam. My name is Jensen, and this is Ramlose. - May we speak to the Misses Hald? - Yes, go ahead and come inside. They are in here. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - Do you remember us? - Yes, don't you want to sit down? - Yes, thank you, that's kind. - What do you want from us? - Do you want to hand over the money? - No, but we have a proposal. - Apparently there is no interest. After all, we bought the bond in an honorable way. Now we want to share with you. You can't prove it's yours, so we have a compromise proposal. - That sounds amiable. - A little too gracious. You don't hand over 100,000 if there is nothing moldy about it. There's nothing moldy about it... Right, Hans. - Right, Hans? - No... not mold. - Did you get the money? - Nah... They wanted to be sure and wanted to share with us. Do you think we were born yesterday? Who is entitled to the money? The state must decide that. We do not want charities, so that you can decorate your conscience. Come, let's go, Hans. Yes, we only meant well. They can think about it. Then we apologize for the inconvenience. There is one thing you need to know if you get the money. 15% is deducted in tax. - Goodbye, Mrs. Hald. - Goodbye. Why did they leave already? What did they want? - They wanted to share the money with us. - We said no. Stupid. The two musicians stand strong because they have the bond. You have to prove it's yours. Where do you get that proof from? They said they had bought the bond from a wholesaler. - They didn't say who. - Because it's a lie. - Yes, maybe it's a fabrication - Now they're offering us half. Do you know what you were supposed to do? You should speak to the district court prosecutor. Yes, if you call the business and say we are sick. Yes, I'll do that. Where are you going? Are you sick? And you have made beds! - We wanted to give you coffee. - It's a day of celebration. Then I can clean up... First we drink coffee. Would you like to be our guest? - Yes, thank you. - Here you go. You always sleep. It's no fun cleaning at 5 o'clock. If you went to bed at 2 am, would you not sleep anymore? - Why are you guys up so early today? - We have received a letter. - The money is available for payment. So is it true with all that money? - You can joke about a lot. - But not with money. - And I'm getting married. - Me too. - With the same girl? - Almost. With two sisters. We have decided that this morning. - Because we like them. - To avoid nonsense. - It's a surprise. - The girls don't know yet. Well, we gotta go before they spend all the money. - We'll take your bag. - Yes, finally do that. There you go. A check. If you want to sign here. - Don't we get human money? - Surely there is coverage? Yes, it is from the National Bank so it should be good enough. Are you sure about that? Yes, your mother is right. Seek out the two musicians - - and suggest sharing with them. - It's our money! - You can't prove that. - How do we get hold of those two? - We'd better call them. 17 21... Hello, is this Mrs. Hambro? Yes, that's it... No, they're not home. They have gone for a walk in town. Thank you. Goodbye. - They'll be home in a bit. - We can't run up to them. Just stand by the Round Tower. You can't avoid running into them then. - Pretend it's random? - Approach them! You cannot do that! It went very well when you stopped me. They better get going. - Hello. Hello. - It was an amusing coincidence. What a surprise to see you at this end of town. I thought of you. I've been thinking about you since we met. I have that on you too. We were her and... - Where are you going to? - We were going... to the Round Tower. - We have never been there. - We don't have that either. - Then come along! - Can we? - Of course. - Then we can play tourists. How beautiful it is here. You can see far. If only there weren't so many grids. A shame it's hazy. Roskilde Cathedral is out there in clear sunshine. It is also there in rainy weather. - How do you know that? - I know the bell ringer. - How do we get told we want to share? - It must be done diplomatically. - You can see where we live. - Where? The house between the other two. On the 3rd floor. - We won't be there much longer. - We are moving. We don't know where. - I want my own little home. - With your friend? - Nah, I can't stand him. - I also want my own. I want 2, 3 rooms with kitchen and bath. I want that too, and knock balcony and crash chute. And a mat with "Welcome". There is only one thing missing. - And what is it? - A sweet little wife. - Anyone in particular? - A definite one. - It sounds mysterious. - It's not mysterious. It is them. Me? Are you proposing to me? Of course. We would never have proposed if we had nothing to offer you. - Have you got the money? - Yes, we cashed the check we got. - Where are you going with it?! - It's my money. You will get your 50 cr. back. - Who is he? - The one we bought the bond from. - Where are our bikes? - I have sold them. - You will probably get some others. - Look, he admits it. - Then we have our witness. - Let's get the police. The police? Aage Duus. Private explorer. At your service. - Arrest him! - They are under arrest. No...! - Where's the money now, huh?! - They are a real rascal. It hangs down there on the wall. - Can't we find a pole? - I have a better idea. If you fish it out, we'll forget about the police. - They will probably get a bounty. - How much? - 1000 crowns. - Where is it? If I stand there and he holds my hand, - - then he can reach it. - It's really deep there - Just put on the gloves. Now watch out, now watch out. It hangs over there. I can't reach it at all. One more man has to go out. - Come on, Poul. - Okay, I'll crawl down to you. Hello, this is from the Regent. Can I ask for the fire department. There are some who are about to fall from the Round Tower... - Can you reach it? - Yes, I think so. - So, now I have it. - It was good. I want 5000 crowns. - If you're naughty, I'll kick you down. - 5000, yes or no? - It's the girls' money. - Alright, 5000. Now get up! (emergency) I can't get back up. - Grab the bag, Poul. - I can't with my toes. Nah, look down there. Oh, thank God. After him, Poul. He runs with the money! Be careful when you jump. There are firefighters. Hurry up and get up. You didn't think I'd run away with the money, did you? - You didn't think I would run? - Of course not. Let's go back to the others. Uuuuuuh... Heeeelp, mommy... - Did you hurt yourself? - No. - How childish you are! - The pram drove with me. - You're alive. Do you have the money? - Yes, here. - Thanks for living. - Well, you're not going anymore? Now we have to go up to the High Court prosecutor Hartsen. It reminds me of something I need to fix. 34 76.... It's all right. Their husband was the prosecutor for the two ladies who had DKK 200,000 stolen. - Where are they now? - In my box... The ladies? In your office with their boyfriends. - Where did they come from? - From the top of Round Tower. - Tell me, have you been drinking? - No, thank you very much. We would like to speak to District Court prosecutor Hartsen. The High Court prosecutor is busy and cannot be disturbed. - Won't you take a seat? - Nah. Let me see... A Copenhagen building. - We come straight from the Round Tower. - Right, yes. Round tower. - What happened? Have you gone mad? - We ran all the way. - What do you want? - Married. - Then you must go to the town hall. - Now we have the 200,000. - Cash even. - Yes... don't we? - Who has them? - Here. 200,000 human crowns. Minus 15%. - Minus 5000 strong. - Who are they? - The witness that the money is ours. - We will settle the matter by getting married. Should I be cheated out of witness money? It is 4 crowns. - They must have 5,000. - Plus 4 crowns in witness money. - Of course. - Of course. - Hey. - Hey. Do you want a piece of chocolate? There is soft nougat. Wasn't it sweet of me to come clean? - Are we good friends again? - So you never get hot-tempered again? - Do you promise... absolutely? - Yes. Good evening. Is there anything I can tempt the lady with? There are lovely Spanish grapes. We have lovely warm summer apples. And bananas, maybe? Shall we take a small handful? There are 11 here. It will be 3 crowns and 30 ore. - We say 3 crowns. Shall we? - Yes, please. Our friend got the biggest wish of his life fulfilled. Let's say goodnight with one last glimpse of Bellahoj - - where the story began. All is peace and harmony. What the light is still burning on the top floor - - with our legal family. Now what can it be? I will not take it! I am the most peaceful person on earth! - So shut up! - No, I do not. - There must be a limit! - Take the vase there. Ah yes, such is life. Let's take a look at the newly engaged and see if they can enjoy themselves. There is a (giant) who rises so high and so proud against the cloud for over 300 years it has kept watch over our lovely city it was at the Round Tower that I found my happiness my heart pounded loudly the last bit I thought at first it was the difficulty of the steep trip then it dawned on me that it was just love we stood and looked down on the bustle of the city then you smiled at me and I got dizzy On Sunday, when the two of us go out for a walk again, we'll go Up in the dear old Round Tower the citizens thank you for the tower you gave us, Christian the Fourth it is a sight which every one holds dear to my heart it was at the Round Tower that I found my happiness my heart pounded loudly the last bit I thought at first it was the difficulty of the steep trip then it dawned on me that it was just love we stood and looked down on the bustle of the city then you smiled at me and I got dizzy On Sunday, when the two of us go out for a walk again, we'll go up the dear old Round Tower. ---Subtitles Essery.---
