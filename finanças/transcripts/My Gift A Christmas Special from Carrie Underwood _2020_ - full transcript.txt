Welcome to "My Gift," a Christmas special from me, Carrie Underwood. Many of the songs we'll be performing are true gifts to us all, and we have treasured them for decades. I'll be singing a few of my all-time favorites as well as some new songs that I had the pleasure of recording for my very first Christmas album. I invite you all to join in and sing the ones you know with us as we enjoy a night filled with music, hope, and good cheer. Here to help us celebrate, my long-time friend Rickey Minor and our orchestra. ["Away in a Manger"] [gentle music] ♪ Away in a manger ♪ ♪ No crib for a bed ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ Lay down his sweet head ♪ ♪ The stars in the sky ♪ ♪ Look down where he lay ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ Asleep on the hay ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ The cattle are lowing ♪ ♪ The poor baby wakes ♪ ♪ But little Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ No crying he makes ♪ ♪ I love thee, Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ Look down from the sky ♪ ♪ And stay by my side ♪ ♪ Till morning is nigh ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Be near me, Lord Jesus ♪ ♪ I ask thee to stay ♪ ♪ Close by me forever ♪ ♪ And love me, I pray ♪ ♪ Bless all the dear children ♪ ♪ In thy tender care ♪ ♪ And take us to heaven ♪ ♪ To live with thee ♪ ♪ There ♪ ♪ ♪ I love that line. "Bless all the dear children in thy tender care." Children are truly our greatest gift, and for this album, "My Gift," I had the pleasure of sharing the thing that I love doing most in the world, singing, with one of the people that I love beyond measure, my son Isaiah. [soft percussive music] - Whee... I'll play in here. - "The Little Drummer Boy" is a central song in "My Gift." That's where the title of the album came from, and it's one of my absolute favorite Christmas songs, and I started thinking about what would make it extra special. Sing close to this thing. So I have a very special duet partner, my son Isaiah. Can you hear yourself? - Yeah. - [laughs] - [chuckles] That's good, huh? - It's loud! - He loves to sing, and... that is so his personality. He'll make crafts, or he'll do things for you, and he's like, "Didn't I do a good job? Didn't I do my best? Are you proud of me?" And it's the sweetest thing, and I just thought his sweet little voice would just sound perfect. We can just try it a couple times and see how it feels. - I can do it as much times as you want. - If nothing else, I have this for the rest of my life. I think it's the perfect piece of the puzzle for this whole album. - I'm ready! - Here it comes. Here we go. ♪ ♪ - ♪ Little baby ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I am a poor boy too ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I have no gift to bring ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ That's fit to give our king ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Shall I play for you? ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ From my drum ♪ ♪ ♪ - ♪ Mary nodded ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ The ox and lamb kept time ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ - ♪ I played my drum for him ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I played my best for him ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ both: ♪ Then he smiled at me ♪ ♪ Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Me and my drum ♪ - I think it's the best in the world. - Me too. - 'Cause you're singing on it. - Yeah. - Love you. - Love you too, Mama.

Carrie's always been a big fan of Christmas. When Carrie was little, she always wanted to buy presents for everybody. So she always did a few chores around the house, and then she and I went shopping together. On Christmas Eve, everybody gets together, and we all have supper, and we open our presents, which is always a big, you know, free-for-all. Carrie was involved in a lot of school plays because she, you know, kinda had the biggest voice there. [chuckles] - ♪ Voices singing, let's be jolly ♪ ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Rockin' around the Christmas tree ♪ ♪ Have a happy holiday ♪ - She's a great mom, and she loves celebrating Christmas with her kids. - Thank you! - It just makes my heart melt.
