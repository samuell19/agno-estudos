Bill? Darling. I think we're losing hot water again? I know this move is good for you. It's good for us. I'm just worried about Chloe. Bellhaven Cliffs is a beautiful town with a top rated school. Maybe this is the change we need. Are we almost there? This is our new home. It looks bigger than the pictures. Yeah, of course it looks bigger than the pictures, because, you know, the pictures are just little pictures. Looks nice, Rick. Yeah. And it has a pool. What good is a pool without friends to swim in it? We're gonna have to make new friends, Chloe. Come on. Solid butcher block on the island. Extra deep drawers for all your pots and pans. It's beautiful. Rick, you did a great job. But? Eh, took me years to grow my client base and now I got to start all over from scratch. I thought you like baking from scratch. Honey, I know the move is tough on you, but once the folks here get a taste of Gail's Goodies, you'll be back in business. - I guess so. - I know so. And, hey, I believe in you. What is regional manager about? Well, your dad was in charge of managing one Jackie Z company store and now he's managing more than a dozen. - That's more work. - Yes. But it's also more money. And don't forget that 35% discount off all purchases. Their swimsuit selections sucks. That is true. That is true. I'll see if we can start some better choices. - How's that? - Okay. - All right. - Love you. - Good night. - Good night. I know how you feel, Chlo. - I didn't want to move either. - Then why we have to? Because we're a family and we support each other. This was a great opportunity for your dad and it wasn't fair to let him pass it up. I guess. I think you're really gonna like it here. All right, first day school tomorrow. Time for bed. Come on. - I love you so much. - Love you. Good night. Good night. Okay, sweetie, this is it. Nice school. Want me go in with you? I can't believe I even let you come in as far. - I understand. Come here. - Are you kidding? Go. Go, I got this. Have a good day, honey. Oh, a bake sale. Everything looks so delicious. How can I choose only one? Did you make these? I love the decorations? I'm Gail, my daughter's new here. I'm actually a baker, so I'd love to help out some time if you guys are taking volunteers. All right, see you around. Good luck. Bye. Excuse me. Vanessa VanDeBerg. - Gail Gardner. - You're new? Yes. We just moved here. It's my daughter's first day at Bellhaven. Oh, she's gonna love it. And so will you. We're having our first PTA meeting tomorrow night. Oh, I'm not I don't know. You have to join the PTA. It's the best. You get to meet all the other moms. You get to have a say in your child's education and most of all it's fun. Okay, sure. Count me in. Great. And as our first order of business one of my famous crispy marshmallow treats. - Oh. - It's on us. No charge. - Thank you. - My pleasure, Gail. We will see you tomorrow night at seven. Okay, great. Oh, and Gail Yes. Welcome to the PTA. Ugh! Ugh. That's bad. Hey, aren't you in my math... class? Hi. - You're new here. - Yeah, I'm Chloe. Chloe. Pretty name. Serena VanDeBerg, Becca, Haley. So, what's with that girl who just dissed me? Oh, that's "Mopey" Marcy. She's been that way ever since her mother died. Oh, wow. Nice kicks by the way. Thanks. My dad works for JackieZ company. So your dad works behind the counter? No, he's the regional manager for all their stores. Which means I get a big discount on everything. Cool. - Cool. - Cool. Okay, so moving on. As you can see, we put the most expensive items up front like this one. If customers want to bargain, we want them to have to work their way through the store - to be able to find it. - So Mr. Gardner - Uh, Rick, please. - Rick? Um, what if customers complain that the cheaper products are in the back? I'll just tell them to come speak to me Sissy. And what if you're not here? I mean, will you be here every day? No, I won't be here every day. But I'll be here as often as needed. So women's fitness Honey, I'm home. Mm, smells great in here. How was work? Uh, was good. Really good. The team at this branch, they are pretty solid. Won't need too much retraining. Honey, shoes off in the house. - Oh, sorry. - My favorite. - Wait! - Oh. - My God. Did you make this? - Of course not. I bought it at the school bake sale. - Horrible, right? - Yeah. How do you screw up a rice krispies treat? It's just rice krispies and marshmallow. Well, not everyone is as talented a baker as your wife. Yes, please. So I'm going to a PTA meeting tomorrow night. What? I know. This one mom kind of guilted me into it. But I figured I'll meet some people, drop some new clients. Good thinking. I have to drive up to the Sandusky Bay tomorrow. Otherwise, I would join you. I'm really sorry. Yeah, right. Oh, excuse me. I'm looking for the auditorium. Oh, thanks. - There you are. - Oh my God. Oh, Vanessa. Hi. - You made it. - Yes. Cookies. Wow. I'll find a special place for these. Follow me. Hello, hello. Let's get started. Good evening ladies and Frank. I officially call to order the inaugural meeting of the Bellhaven PTA for the new school year. No doubt this will be a year to remember. The big fund-raisers this fall will be our bake sales, our annual Halloween festivals, the walkathon and of course, restaurant nights. So I make a motion to set aside $300 for advertising. - Okay, do we have a second? - Second. No, Sunny, you can't second your own motion. Second. Thank you, Frank. All those in favor? - Aye. - Aye. The ayes have it. First off, I want to give a shout out to the woman who ran the yearbook before me, Lexie Wilson. We miss you, Lex. You were an inspiration. And we're going to make this yearbook something you'd be proud of. Excellent. If there is no other new business, I'd like to take a moment to introduce our newest member, Gail Gardner. Gail, tell us a little bit about yourself. Okay. Sorry, excuse me. Uh I'm Gail. My husband and I just moved here with our daughter Chloe, and I used to have a catering company, Gail's Goodies. I actually have some business cards with me. I do birthday cakes, cupcakes, muffins. Okay, well, thank you, Gail. With all that fancy baking experience, we'll be counting on your help with the bake sales. Welcome aboard. Chloe is in seventh grade. These whole teen attitude things are really kicking in. I hear you. Our son is like 13 going on 30. - Best cookies ever, Gail. - Thank you, Frank. Here you go, Vanessa. Bye, Gail. See you at Vanessa's party Saturday night. Thanks. Looking forward to it. Fun, right. Yes. Listen, I hope I wasn't out of line with the business cards. No, not at all. Though it was certainly a first. I'm sorry. It's fine. So Sunny told you about the party? Yes. Thank you. My pleasure. I guess we'll see you Saturday. Good night. Yes? What? She's a newbie. But she's so nice. - Who is the PTA president? - You are. Exactly. Let's not forget that. Chloe, I'm home. Hey. Hey. Your dad's not home yet? Nope. So was it scary staying home all alone? All you and dad talk about is how safe this neighborhood is. Good point. Your dad's not answering. Almost time for bed, missy. Thanks for calling Rick Gardner. You reached my voicemail. I'm unavailable. Thanks for calling Rick Gardner. You reached my voicemail. I'm unavailable. - Hey. - Hey. I texted and I called. My phone died. Car charging cord isn't working. I didn't realize till I was already on the road. Sorry. I'm sorry. I thought I know what you thought. Gail, I don't know what it's gonna take to get you to trust me again. I trust you, but you just have to understand how I feel. But I didn't cheat on you. I believe you. Just all these texts back and forth. It was a stupid flirtation and it got out of hand. That's it. Honey, look at me. I'm not interested in anyone but you, okay? Okay. Okay, which one? - This one? - That's what I was thinking. What do you guys think? - So cute. - Love it. - Chic. - Chic. Looks nice. - Hi. Are you guys ready? - Hi. Yes. And I will be using a discount card. You're Rick Gardner's daughter. - Yes, I'm Chloe. - Your dad's super cool. Are we talking about the same person? Yes, we are. He's a great manager. Much better than the last guy. Oh, and I will be using the discount card for my friends' stuff too. Actually, I think we could use it only on your items. - Oh, I didn't know that. - Yeah. Chloe, is there a problem? But we'll let it slide. Thank you. Well, not too shabby. I think we'll have to look up the price online. Just wait till we get home, please. Gail. Hey. And you sir, not what I expected. And you're at least a half hour too early. Vanessa, this is my husband Rick? - Hi. - And you said eight, right? Oh, my God. Of course, Rick. Hi. I'm sorry. This party is for PTA moms. No male allowed. - Oh, I didn't realize. - That's okay. I totally get it. - I get it. - No, honey. Oh, sorry. Before I forget, here. You girls have fun. Just text me when you're done. I'll come pick you up. - Are you sure? - Yeah, absolutely. Merlot! Ooh! - Love you. - Love you too. That husband of yours is a keeper. Yeah. - Ladies, you all remember Gail? - Hi everyone. Dinah, Sunny, all the girls. Hi. This is so nice. Thanks for inviting me. - Uh, ladies room? - Around the corner. The other door. I didn't know everyone was gonna be so dressed up. No, you look great. Still I mean, look at that dress Vanessa's wearing. If I told you how much it cost, you wouldn't believe it. So is there a Mr. VanDeBerg? He was a successful man. Was? Are they divorced? No. He died. Vanessa's a widow. - Oh, terrible. - Yeah. She doesn't like to talk about it though. Of course not. I understand. Who wants tequila shots? - To the PTA. - To the PTA. - Evening, ma'am. - Evening officer. You have some complaints from the neighbors. Have we now? Ladies, may I have your attention? It appears the neighbors have been complaining about the noise. But I think it's only nine o'clock. That's right. Now normally I'd let you off with a warning, but you girls have been pretty naughty tonight. Vanessa, thank you for a very interesting evening. The pleasure was all mine. Remember, not a word of this to anyone? For PTA moms only. Okay. Now, off you go. So how was it? Interesting. We, uh, played charades. You smell like a distillery. It was charades in front of a bunch of strangers. I needed to be loose. Oh, and I found out Vanessa is a widow. Really? No kidding. Yeah. I wonder how he died. Maybe he was asphyxiated by her overwhelming perfume And I've been thinking I'd love to have evening in the window for the first two weeks. - Yes, great plan. - Okay, perfect. And I think someone wants to talk to you. Rick, can I have a word? Hey, what's up? Thank you. Your daughter Chloe was in here the other day. I know. I saw the charges on my card. Well, she used your discount card, but she also used it for her friends. Now, that I did not know. And technically the same card can only be used on one charge. Otherwise, someone can just pass the card around. You're absolutely right. Thank you for the heads up. And there's something else. One of them stole a pair of sunglasses. Really? Was it Chloe? No, one of her friends. I'm so sorry to bring this up. I don't want to get anyone in trouble. No, no, no, you're doing the right thing. Thank you, and I'll talk to her. Being a teenage girl is tough. Believe me. I was a real handful. So if Chloe ever wants someone to talk to, I'd be happy to help out. Thank you, Sissy, that's very nice. But I think Chloe will probably talk to her mom. Of course. It's just sometimes we need to turn to people outside of our family for certain things. I'm busy. It's us. Your parents. Oh. Come in. Hey, we wanted to have a little talk. You do know I know everything. We had sex ed at school. And my friends filled in the gaps. Um, good to know. Sweetheart, actually, this is about the discount card. - You said I can use it. - And you can. Just that your friends used it too. They all paid for their own stuff. I just helped out. It's great you're making friends. We just wanted to make sure they're your real friends. Of course they are. And I want to invite them to the pool this weekend. Okay, sure. Great. Uh, one more thing. It seems that a pair of sunglasses might have been stolen. That must be a mistake. They wouldn't do that. Okay, well, we're just letting you know. These girls have names by the way? Becca, Haley and Serena. - Serena VanDeBerg. - Yeah. Ah, I know her mom. - Hi, mom. - Hey. How was school? Right. Never ask a kid that question. - Hi, Chloe. - Hi. Who's that? Just some girl from my math class? She seems nice. Do you want to invite her over to the pool? - No. - Why not? She's a weirdo since her mom died. Oh, that poor little girl. Hold on. Hi. Hi, I'm Gail Gardner. Gail Jack. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. If we could just get your number that would be really great. You guys are in math class together. Nice to meet you. Bye. Come on. So Becca, your dad's a doctor, right? - Yeah. - What kind? Medical doctor I think. And Haley your dad's in advertising. Yeah, but nothing cool. What about your dad? - My dad died. - Oh, I'm sorry. I know. Um, I mean like what was... What was his job? Something with money management I think. Let's take a selfie and make everyone super jealous. Perfect. Not bad, Gail. - What's cookin'? - Oh my God. You scared me. Hmm, the door was open. Well, come on in. Uh, your early. I'll tell Serena you're here. Nah, let them hang. What do I smell? Oh, it's a birthday cake order for Frank from the PTA. He's so sweet. He's become one of my biggest fans. Hmm, Frank does like his sweets. Sorry, could I ask you to take off your shoes? - My shoes? - Honestly, I don't care. It's Rick, he's got this thing about germs. Well, we certainly want to keep Rick happy. Uh, let me clean up all this stuff. No, it's fine. Don't mind me. I have to say, the one downside to baking is all the mess. Hmm, that's what domestic help is for. So you're gonna give me the grand tour or what? Uh sure. And this is Chloe's room. Cute. I love that comforter. A couple of closets over here. And this is the master bedroom. Hmm. Nice. Firm. So, looks like you guys are pretty well settled. I guess so. Great schools. Great neighborhood. Great neighbors. Of course. And so safe. Yeah, well, the only crime around here is adultery. Uh, is that even a crime, I mean legally? It should be. I'm telling you. You gotta keep a tight rein on your man. Oh, I don't know. Ooh, Frank's cake is done. Right. This is a nightmare. I don't know what I did. I must have set the oven too high by mistake. Can I try yours? Sure. This is so nice. Yeah. Lexie loved Pier 60. Hey, girls, why don't you go on? The old folks are gonna hang back, okay? So how do you like living here? It's all right. I miss my old friends. Yeah, I know. Must be weird being the new girl. Yeah, it does. Here. Look. But at least you're making friends with Serena and her crew. Yeah, that's true. I used to be friends with them. Really? Yeah, I'd watch my back if I were you. Okay. Thanks. I have to thank you again for reaching out. Marcy mentioned your daughter to me, but she wouldn't have asked for this on her own. Well, kids can be shy at this age. That's funny. Marcy used to be so outgoing. But she changed. - Sorry. - No, it's okay. My wife Lexie, she wasn't suicidal. I'm so sorry, Jack. We've just gotten over a bump in our marriage and things were going so well. She had just received a big promotion. She had been nominated the next PTA president. It just doesn't make sense. It's so hard to believe. Okay so, can you tell me about last year's PTA election? Oh my God, so insane. Vanessa demanded a recount. - No way. - Yeah. So we do the recount. Exact same totals. Lexie wins. How did you take it? I mean, she was gracious. But you can tell she was just boiling on the inside. - I mean, the PTA is her life. - Yeah, I can see that. So then a week later, Lexie committed suicide, overdosing on pills. - So sad. - It's so sad. Apparently she had been taking antidepressants for years and nobody knew. - Oh my God. - Yeah. Also there were these rumors about Vanessa's husband... A little less gossip, and a little more bake sale, ladies. Okay, so there are these rumors that Lexie was having an affair with Vanessa's husband. What? Did Vanessa know? I don't know. You know the whole thing is very sordid. I just wanted you to hear it from me. Don't ever bring it up to Vanessa. - Never. - Thank you. I mean can you believe it? Depression is real, honey. No, I mean about the affair. Gail, it's not like you to get caught up in this kind of gossip. Gossip? I'm not gossiping. You're right. I'm sorry. Apology accepted. But as repayment, I'm gonna need you to do something for me. Name it. Help me chaperon the Halloween festival. Ah. Oh wait to see the costumes I picked out for us. Okay. Thank you. Oh, my queen, darling. My queen. - M' lady. - M' Lord. You two are so embarrassing. Oh, the royal kitten is displeased. Seriously. Can I please go? Oh, be gone with thee, then. Have a great time, okay? Have fun. Be safe. Good. M' lady. We've arrived. Hello kittens. Miss VanDeBerg, you're a total shoe-in for "Best Parent Costume." Let's hope so, dear. Fabulous doesn't come easy. Well, well, Jack Wilson. What a surprise. I'm just here for my daughter. Yes, such a tragedy. Must be difficult doing it all alone. You know, Vanessa I'd be careful if I were you. What goes around comes around. Well, thanks for coming around, Jack. You guys look great. Thank you. We do these costumes every year. What's going on? You wouldn't believe it. Somebody keyed my car. Oh, my God. - Well, off with their heads. - Rick. Sorry. Oh, wow that's actually really bad. - It is. - Yeah, I know right. It goes down both sides of the car. I can't imagine how much it's gonna cost. And who would do something like this? Teenagers? Yeah, that's probably it. I'm so sorry, Sunny. Thank you. Okay folks, it's time for the best parent costume competition. I'm going to call to the stage our three finalists. First up, Gayan Sarkisian. - Very creative. - Thank you. Next up, no surprise, Vanessa VanDeBerg. And our third finalist is Gail Gardner. Very impressive. Now all three contestants are winners in my book, but we can only crown one best parent costume. I'm going to hold my hand over each person's head and your applause will determine the winner. Ready? Okay, first up the Cereal Box. Okay, okay. Next up, the sorceress. And last, Marie Antoinette. I love you. Well, well, I think we have a winner. Congratulations Gail Gardner. Please enjoy your gift card. Congratulations. Hello. Happy Halloween. Don't you all look divine? Cheers, darling. Cute. Pumpkin! Original. Hi Vanessa. Bonnie and Clyde. Dangerous. - Who goes there? - Hi Vanessa. Well, the royal couple has arrived. How could we refuse the invitation? Who would? Darling, the girls are up in Serena's room trying to decide whether it's cool or not to go trick or treating. Go on up honey. And for the record, I think your custom is amazing. Aren't you sweet? Not amazing enough for the win. It wasn't exactly the most scientific voting method. Gail deserved it. Besides, I can live without a gift card. So wine, beer, scotch? Wine. Scotch. Attaboy. I don't know what to do. Do I just keep the scratches on the car, or pay a fortune to have them removed? Did you report it? - Are you crazy? - Oh, right. I feel so powerless. I can understand that. Right? How many years in a row did your mom win? Every year. It was just a silly costume contest. Said the girl whose mom won. Hey, did you ever end up buying those sunglasses after all? Of course. You were there when I bought them. Right. So are we going trick or treating or what? Nothing wrong with free candy. And free pimples. - Oh, yes. - You're right. So Chloe tells me that your husband - was a money manager. - Rick. It's fine. Yes, Bill was very successful and careful to provide for us before he, you know, passed. So his passing, was it sudden? Bill was not well for quite some time, but the ending came sooner than expected. Sorry, that's terrible. What about you two? The perfect couple, eh? I don't know about that. Oh, what is it? Aw, is Rick's germophobia getting under your skin? Germophobia? Is this because I don't like to wear shoes in the house? Honey, I never said you were germophobic. Oh, someone requires a treat from the sorceress. I think she has a drinking problem. From tonight? Yeah, she had two scotches. Honey, so did I. And what does "Not well" mean? Whatever, she is manipulative, trying to get us to fight. Really? Kind of feel like she was just needling us. I never said you were germophobe. I just asked her to take her shoes off in the house. Gail, she's a lonely bored widow. I think she's just trying to mix things up to be provocative. And flirt. You think she was flirting with me? Get real. Fine. I'm not interested. Besides, her crispy marshmallow treats taste awful. Rick. Rick, there's something I need to tell you. Okay, shoot. Remember that PTA party for moms only? Well, there was a reason that it was moms only. There was a male stripper. Now you're just messing with me? No, this guy came dressed as a cop said we were making too much noise and then started stripping. You're being serious. Wow! I'm sorry I didn't tell you. But it was Vanessa. She got up all in my ear telling me not to tell anyone. It kind of felt like a threat. Are you angry? No. I'm confused. I don't care about the stripper. It's just really weird that you would lie about it. That's what I'm saying. She's manipulative. - It's not like me to lie, right? - I don't know. Is it? You know me. I've never lied to you. You were really convincing. "Oh, we just played charades." I don't know why you weren't just like, "Hey, honey, don't tell anyone there was a stripper." Like you didn't even trust me. That's not what I was thinking. Yeah. Whatever. Motion adopted. Remember this walkathon is a very important fund-raiser. We need to get our kids out there pounding the pavement, raising money, every dollar counts. Any other new business? Yes, Gail. Uh, as some of you know, Sunny's car was recently vandalized in the parking lot. I'd like to propose getting security cameras. Security cameras. Well, security is a very big topic. Let's take a 10 minute break first. Hey, Sunny, how are you? Hi Gail. How's it going? You look so good. I'll just go in here with you. So was it me or was Vanessa kind of weird about that all security camera? I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to get one. Clearly but why not? I mean, aren't we all invested in keeping this a low crime neighborhood? It's not gonna happen, Gail. Well, how do you know? I mean, a camera is a deterrent? - And the next time... - I know who did it. You do? I can't tell you. It's personal matter, and it won't happen again. Was it Vanessa? No. Why would you say that? I don't know. There's just something weird about her. Well, she was openly flirting with my husband - right in front of me. - She does that. Look, I'll tell you this. Don't get on Vanessa's bad side. Got it. See you out there. Excuse me, dear. Hi. Welcome to JackieZ's. Can I help you? Yes, I'd like to speak to the manager. Is there a problem? Can I help? - Actually I'm friends with Rick. - Okay, sure. Hey, Rick. This lady wanted to speak to you. - Hey there, handsome. - Oh Vanessa. What brings you here? - I need a new yoga outfit. - Oh great. - Sissy, if you please show her. - Yeah. Actually I was hoping you could help me. Well, that's not really my area of expertise. But sure, I'd be happy to. Hey, how's it going in there? Could you help me? What do you think? Uh, I don't know. How does it feel? Feels good on the skin. I'm not sure about the size. Could you check the label on the waistband for me? I can't read it. Uh Sure. It's a small. Hmm. Small. Think I should get an extra small? Uh, no. I think it looks great. Rick, everything okay? I think that I think they need me out there. - There. Done. - Sweet. Your turn. No way. That's vandalism. - Everyone does it. - I don't. I don't destroy property and I don't steal. Who said anything about stealing? How much were those sunglasses? I have the receipt. Hmm, doubtful. I'd be careful who you accuse. Ooh, I'm scared. Maybe his phone died. I'm going to try him again. Hi, sorry, I'm late. There was traffic and I couldn't find my phone anywhere. I even pulled over at one point. I thought maybe it had fallen between the seats. - I know. - What? Sissy called. She said you left your phone in a fitting room at the store. That makes sense. I must have left it at work. It's not like you leave your phone lying around. Is she cute, Sissy? Gail, I'm not having an affair with my 25-year-old clerk. Was that a question? - Enter. - Hey. Wow, you're reading. It's for my Science class. Thought you finished your homework already. I did. This is the next assignment. Who are you? And what have you done with my daughter? - I'm not that bad. - No. You're just usually texting your friends by this time. Yeah. Well, they've been a little clicky lately. Serena? Kinda. - Do you want me to talk to her? - Oh God, no. I got it. All right. You can handle it. They, ran for one City Council, so they're actually positions of power in Clearwater. Yeah, he's working on getting some better swimsuits in and he's got a full team. Jack. Hi, Vanessa. So I had a little chat with your husband. He is quite a man. - You spoke to Rick? - I did. I got this at Rick's store. He was so attentive. - The perfect touch. - He's good at his job. Looks great. Hi, welcome to JackieZ. How can I help you? I'm Gail Gardner. Mrs. Gardner. It's so great to finally meet you. And you must be Sissy. I am. I'm sorry for calling you at home. No, you did the right thing. It was a relief to know his phone wasn't lost. Rick is the best manager. Much better than the last one. Well, thank you. He's actually at a different branch today. Oh, I know. I just came to do a little shopping. Gail, I'm home. - Hi. - Hi. What do you think? Um, very nice. You know, I saw someone in this yoga outfit today and I just had to get one. Well, good choice. So who does it look better on me or Vanessa? I think I know where this is heading. Oh, where is it heading? You think something's going on between me and Vanessa? Gail, she stopped by the store. - It was strange. - Strange. You can ask Sissy. She saw the whole thing. Oh, by the way, is very cute. She insisted that I'd help her pick out an outfit. That's it. Then why didn't you mention she came into the store? Are you serious? I don't know. That was the night I lost my phone and I was just frazzled. I don't know. Why didn't you tell me about the male stripper? - That is not the same thing. - It is totally the same thing. No, Vanessa swore me to secrecy. Maybe she did the same thing with you. She did not! Honey, you're just gonna have to trust me. That's the problem, isn't it? - Hi, Mr. Maxwell. - Oh, hi Serena. What's up? I'm collecting pledges for the Bellhaven Academy walkathon. You can spare me the speech. Dinah's on the PTA. So how much can I sign you up for? How does 10 bucks sound? Ten bucks! Thank you. - Hi, Lance Kerwin. - Gail Gardner. Thanks for meeting me on such short notice. We're always happy to meet with potential clients. So tell me, where did you hear about us? Well, my husband worked with Bill VanDeBerg years ago and always talked about what a financial genius he was. And so when we moved to Bellhaven, I thought it was time for some of his some financial advice. I see. Any chance Mr. VanDeBerg is in today? Well, he's actually no longer with us. William VanDeBerg died five years ago. - Oh, my goodness. - Yes. He was great person. I'm so sorry. Was it sudden? Yes, it was terrible. He actually fell down a flight of stairs. Yeah, but people don't just fall down flights of stairs. Maybe she pushed him. Honey, you're overreacting. No, I'm not. There's just, uh, something off about her. Hold on. I'm getting another call. Yes? Miss Gardner. This is the Bellhaven Academy. I'm calling you about your daughter, Chloe. Oh my God. Is she all right? She's fine. But there's been an incident. We're going to need you to come to the school. I'm on my way. - Chloe? - I'm fine. - What's this about? - Ask her? - Serena? - Ask her. What is going on? Serena, are you okay? All right, folks. Let's take it inside. So Coach Stephen says she saw Chloe and Serena fighting. It was self-defense. You started it. That's total BS. She hit me first. You are such a liar. - You've got serious problems. - You need meds. What a stupid thing to say. Don't talk to my daughter that way. What way? I'm her mother. I don't need you butting in. Maybe if you were a better mother - I wouldn't have to. - Ladies. I'm so sorry. Now, Marta, we have been at Bellhaven since kindergarten. I don't care how long you've been here. Vanessa. You run the PTA. I run the school. Not the same thing. - Perhaps not but... - Listen. I don't know what's up with your daughters, but we do not and will not tolerate this kind of behavior here. One day suspensions for both of you. That's ridiculous. I could have you fired. Good luck with that. We're done here. Let's go Serena. This is completely unacceptable. Will this suspension go on my record? Not if I can help it. By the way, I don't want you hanging around with that Chloe Gardner anymore. No problem. Never liked her much anyway. Oh, Chlo, are you sure you want to keep hanging out with those girls? Well, they're kind of my only friends? Maybe you're right. They mostly only care about themselves anyway. You're better than that. Now I'm that weird outcast new girl again. No, you're not. I don't know, honey, I'm just proud that Chloe stuck up for herself. That's one way to look at it. What if Vanessa wants some sort of payback? She has her issues but she's not going to do anything. Did I show you the obit? William VanDeBerg, founder and CEO of VanDeBerg financials, blah, blah, blah, survived by his wife Vanessa and daughter Serena. No mention of cause of death. - It is an obituary. - Right. So I searched more. Police were called to the home and found Mr. VanDeBerg at the foot of his basement steps dead with a broken neck. Who falls down their own stairs? It happens. And she implied to me that he cheated on her. And the rumor was that it was with Lexie Wilson. So maybe she pushed him. I... I don't know. I don't know Gail. What's with all this stuff she makes up about him being sick? Maybe that's just her way of coping with things. She probably doesn't want to relive this. Hey, you've got some reviews on the Bakery website, but they don't look good. How bad is it? Um, you tell me. "Gail's Goodies is anything but" "The muffins are dry and stale, "and I actually found a human hair in one of my cookies." "Run don't walk from this shoddy overpriced so-called business"? Signed V. It must be her. This was posted an hour ago. What a terrible thing to do. This is a coincidence? V? You know, this is libel or slander. I'm just going to remove the review. You can only remove it if it's less than three stars. She gave me exactly three stars. She's good. But she doesn't know who she's messing with. And neither do you. Those are for clients. So I heard you got suspended. Wrong. I just stayed home with a sore throat. Same day that Chloe stayed home too? So how much have you guys raised for the walkathon so far? - Seventy bucks. - Ninety. I've raised 100 so far. Oh, hey, Chloe. How much money did you raise for the walkathon? Around 400. Good morning everyone. Thank you for showing up at 9 am on a Saturday for a campus beautification. Let's make Bellhaven sparkle. Hey. Hey. Can I ask you about last year's PTA election? Lexie was a good friend. So she won the election and then committed suicide? Who told you that? Look, I just came here today to clean up the campus. You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, what I'm about to tell you, you can't tell anyone. Of course not. Lexie was having some personal problems. So I gave her a couple of my sleeping pills. Just a couple. Not enough for an overdose. That's what just didn't make any sense. What do you think happened? I don't know. But Lexie's husband Jack, he put up a real stink to the police and... Our families were close, but I didn't want to dig any deeper - because... - Because what? Because because somehow Vanessa knew I'd given Lexie the pills. And I was afraid she would implicate me. I'm a terrible person. No. Not at all. - Big surprise. - What? Can't a friend make a neighborly visit? We're just about to sit down for dinner. Oh, how is Darren? What do you want, Vanessa? I want to know what you and Gail were talking about at that school. Was a private conversation. Doesn't concern you. Everything concerns me. It was just girl talk. Fine. My daughter came by the other day and got a measly $10 donation from your husband. So? So why don't you go and grab your wallet? Vanessa, you look amazing. You're sweet. I try. Thank you so much for coming in today. We just need your signature on a couple of your husband's financial docs. No problem. You know, we sure miss Bill around here. He was a real mentor to me. I know. In fact, I thought about you guys the other day. A potential client came in and was asking if Bill was around. Really? Who? Hmm Gail Gardner. Gail Gardner? You know her? The walkathon was a big success, raising $6,385. The winner with over $1,000 in donations is Serena VanDeBerg. - Ooh! - Congratulations. This is your gift card to the JackieZ company. Ooh, on behalf of my daughter, thank you very much. I know she'll be very excited. Wow. How lucky is that? Serena's won it every year. Pretty lucky. Time for new business. Gail, you're going to brief us on restaurant night? So I spoke with the Red Velvet Shake company. And I'm excited to announce that they have agreed, apparently for the very first time, to participate. They'll be donating 30% of all purchases next Thursday night. Ooh! Red Velvet Shake Co.! Good job, Gail. Yes. Great job, Gail. - Hey. - Yeah? - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - It's about Vanessa's husband. - No, Gail. Just let it go. Look, I know he fell down a flight of stairs and broke his neck. But I was reading that she was initially a suspect and then was later exonerated. Okay, Gail. You need to let it go. You're new. You don't understand. Why are you so scared of her? Because she blackmailed me. - Blackmailed? - I am the PTA treasurer. So I am in charge of a lot of money. Okay, there was a talk this one year of an audit over how the funds were being spent. And she was going to tell them that I had been embezzling money unless I went along with her husband's death. So I did. Oh, Sunny, I'm so sorry. So just let it go. Okay? I'll see you at the PTA massage party. Oh, God, did I do it again? I always assume everyone's invited. You know, Vanessa is gonna kill me. Not literally. It's okay. I don't like massages anyway. That feels great. You know, I do offer other services as well. You're doing it now. Hey Gail, are we good? We are. Yes, this is she. Oh. Oh, um are you sure? I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. This has never happened before. Let me look into it and get back to you. Oh, wait, who was that? A woman who threw the baby shower? Apparently six of the guests came down with food poisoning. And they've narrowed it down to everyone who ate the cookies. But that's impossible. Oh my God, Chloe had a cookie from that batch. Took her temperature again. She's totally fine. Of course she is. She ate the cookies before Vanessa had a chance to poison them. Why would she do something like this? I got another review. "I attended a baby shower catered by Gail's Goodies. "What a nightmare. Not only was the food inedible, "but six of the guests came down with food poisoning. "Thank God the pregnant mother didn't. "Gail's Goodies should be shut down by the Health Department." Signed V? Yep. Still think this is a coincidence? Why would she do something like this? I don't know. Anger. Jealousy. Well, I guess she's jealous of you, but this this is crazy. Why would she take it this far? Serena getting suspended, me asking too many questions about her past. Everyone is scared of her. But I'm not. I'm going to find out. How? At her massage party. - Her massage party? - Yep. - She invited you? - Nope. You got to be careful. Now, don't I treat you ladies, right? You do. To Vanessa. To Vanessa. Where is Gail? She told me she didn't like massages. Probably reminds her of a creepy uncle. Oh, wow. Serena, would you get that? Oh, hi, Mrs. Gardner. - Hi, Serena. - They're all in the den. Oh, thanks. You know, I'm sorry about the whole Principal's office thing. Sometimes being a teenager can be hard. And life's too short to hold grudges. My mom says scratches make us stronger. I'm not so sure about that. Hey ladies. - Gail? - Gail? So you showed up after all? Yeah, so sorry I'm late. I wanted these to be fresh out of the oven. Anybody? No? Maybe later. So can I get in on one of these massages? Perhaps you'd like to take my spot. Sure. I thought you said you didn't like massages? What? That's what you said when I invited you. Oh, people change. Give her back a good crack. Can I help you? Uh, just giving myself the grand tour. You like snooping around, don't you? - Snooping? - Yeah. I noticed you found the elevator in the basement. What do you think it's down there? I don't know. You tell me. I don't know. Water heater, boxes. - So, memories? - You could say that? Good memories or bad memories? Both. You're V, aren't you from the online reviews. V? I don't know what you're talking about. You poisoned my food at the baby shower. Well, you're a little paranoid. I can't afford to lose business over bad reviews. - I have a reputation. - So do I. Mom, the massage people are leaving. Coming, Serena. Oh, and Gail Watch your step on the way down? What happened? I think I should go to the police. And say what? Ask them to reopen the cases. Honey, I don't think it works like that. You'd need evidence, maybe even Dinah and Sunny to agree. It's so unfair. She gets away with it. Yes, it is. Thank you, officer. Well, you're right. These are bad reviews. But I'm afraid this is not a police matter. I'm just saying this is evidence that she's trying to destroy my business. - Was anyone hospitalized? - No, thank God. Just some nausea and vomiting. You ever think about handling this yourself? No, because I think she's unstable - and possibly violent. - Really? Five years ago, her husband fell down the stairs and broke his neck. But Vanessa told me that he had cheated on her and died of some vague illness. Vanessa lost the election for PTA president to a woman who mysteriously committed suicide, but no one believed that she was suicidal. And when I started asking questions, another mom's car was vandalized. Look, saying this out loud I realize how it sounds. No, I... I understand. You think any of these other women would be willing - to come forward? - No. Uh They're all scared of her. Well, without something more tangible I'm afraid my hands are tied. If you see anything else suspicious... let us know. Thank you. Let's go. I've been dreaming about milkshakes all week. I don't think I can go. Gail, you ready? Gail, honey, you ready? I'm just finishing up this last minute online order. Might be the last one I get for a while. Okay, well, who's it for? Some Bellhaven Alumni Committee. They're having an early breakfast tomorrow and need me to drop this stuff off at the school cafeteria tonight. Maybe you could join us there. They look delicious. Honey, I'm also very sorry that the Police weren't more helpful. You were right. If I'm going to swing by Vanessa say something to her? - What would you possibly say? - Stay away from my wife. You're sweet. No. - Now, go on. - Okay. I'm gonna text you. I'm sure there's gonna be a long line. Meet us there? Maybe. That would be nice. Okay. Dammit. Oh, good thing I have an extra dozen in the car. Come on. Hello. I'm with Gail's Goodies. I have the order. Hello, Gail. Oh my God. Vanessa. Nice outfit. What are you doing here? Where else would I be? I'm catering an alumni committee breakfast. Are you on the committee? Well, that certainly would be fun. There was an alumni committee. So who placed the order? What do you want, Vanessa? What do I want? It's time we have a little chat, Gail. It's Rick. He wants to know if... Hey! As much as I'd love to see your tasty husband, now is not the time. He knows where I am. If I don't answer his text, he's gonna come over here. Or not. I'm sure there's a long line at Red Velvet. It's just you and me. Okay, so you wanted to talk. Let's talk. Actually I have nothing to say to you. I just want you out of my hair. Who the hell do you think you are waltzing in here taking over my world? Fooling everyone with your fake charm What? Sneaking around, poking, prying. Vanessa, I really I don't care. Oh, you live for it. You think you're better than everyone else with that perfect house and that charming little family? Stop! It's from mom. Finally. What did she say? "Help. V is" V is what? Are you... are you kidding? No. You think V as in Vanessa? There's mom's car. Hey, Gail. Gail? What's going on, dad? Honey, lock the doors. Stay in the car. - It's everything okay? - Yes. Everything's going to be fine. Stay in the car. Pull up the window. Gail. Oh, Gail, I know you're in here. Gail. Shoes off in the house. Gail. Oh, my God. Gotcha! Here we are again. Top of the stairs. What are you doing? People die in accidents every day. - You're crazy, you know that? - Oh, aren't you a genius? How would you feel if your husband cheated on you for years with the darling woman who was trying to replace you? I don't know. Well, they've got what they deserved. Oh, my God. Gail? And now it's your turn, bitch. Go to hell, Vanessa. Oh no, now you're gonna get it. No! Gail. Gail, you're okay? Rick. Honey! Are you... are you okay? I'm fine. It's over. It's finally over. - Hi, baby. - Hey, mom. How are things with grandma? They're okay. How are you? The doctors say the arm is healing pretty well. Good. And my lawyers are working hard on my appeal. I'll be out of here in no time. Of course you will, mom. Oh, and get this. The other ladies just voted me cell-block President. Oh, wow! It is so wonderful to be with you all here this evening. We have had an eventful few months to say the least. And I think we can all agree that we're happy to be moving forward. You know, I've learned that the PTA is more than just an organization. It should represent honesty, integrity, and character. So fittingly, it is my pleasure and honor to introduce to you our good friend, and the new president of the Bellhaven PTA, Ms. Sunny Park.
