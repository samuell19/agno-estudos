What's that noise? Eddie? Did you forget something? Mike! No, no! Help me! Help me! Please, help! Help me! Fucking restraining order, Kate? Mike, stop! Ah, Mike, stop! Help me! You came in today? Um, had to finish last night's totals. Go get some rest. I'll do it. I'm a big girl, Eddie. Pills don't work for me. Just help me out, please. Okay? Call him. I-- I-- I can't concentrate, okay? It's got me fucked up. I see his face everywhere. I know I'm being a terrible friend, but please, just ask your brother to set it up. Mike almost took your eye, Kate. You need to go back to group, not into the woods, by yourself. All those women, staring at me... I don't like it, okay? Just help me out. See if they need people. Call him. We don't talk much anymore. Nick, it's been two days and they still haven't found Mike. He'll come. When you find a fire, then what do you do? Generally, you call it in and you give a reading, something called an azimuth reading, where it kind of shows you where in the sky the fire is. So, you, like, did some research? Yeah, you have to. You have to take a class to be able to do this. I'm proud of you. So, you really ready? It's me you're talking to. I'm really ready, Nickie. This is the best thing for me, I promise you. Did you bring one? Do they have one? -I gotta get one. -You gotta get one. - I definitely do. - Do they have a store? Nah, I don't need a bag. Her birthday today. Well, you told me yesterday. Heh. -All right. -Happy birthday. Thanks, Hal. -How you doing? -Good. Good morning. Have a good one. You, too. Earl. Hi. A room with your sister for two years in the city, and we end up meeting on the mountain. Hmm. Nice to meet you, Kate. Hi, Nick. Uh, thanks for doing this. I know it wasn't easy. It's good to see you. -You, too. -How's Corinne? She's uh-- she's good. Um, nice of you to ask. Look, Nick, uh, I know the plan was for me to drive you down to Sandpoint, but a spot fire just went up by Bonners Ferry, so I gotta keep an eye on it. Dan's gonna have to drive you-- ...now, otherwise, you'll miss the last train. Catch up when you come back, after Kate serves her three months? We'll do it then, I promise. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Uh, I got you something. It's from when Dad was at Fairchild. -See you in three months. -Yeah. Okay, paperwork this way. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. -I love you. -I love you, too. Thanks for driving up. - All right, you got this? - Yeah. -Don't let him give you shit. -Okay. Drive safe. Okay, standard release and liability stuff. ILD Fire emailed me your first aid certificate. You have survival training, correct? A little, mainly medical at Wazoo. -I aced the Osborne course. -Got the e-mail. Okay. You are officially an Idaho Lands Department volunteer. Thank you, Earl. I know you pulled some strings. Yeah, well, uh, we need the help. That her? Yeah, day after the big fire. Hell all around her, but she didn't go down. Mm. That had to feel good. No. It was a terrible day. Thank you. Everybody walks from here. Fire take the rest of the road? Took a lot more than that. Katie, my lady. Coyotes. Better get used to it. All right, that's your bathroom. Pit toilet, ten feet deep. Sometimes hikers want to use it, mostly women. -It's a squeeze, though. -Eh, tight spaces relax me. Had their heyday from 1930 to 1950. After the Big Burn o' 1910, Uncle Sam said the States had to bear the cost of firefighting. Forest Service was only five years old then. It's still pretty small. Just didn't have enough men to protect that many acres. Uh, still don't, really. Anyway, all these towers went up as a result. It's beautiful. Yeah, on a clear day, the viewshed'll give you over 100 miles. Not today, though. Fire's up in Kootenai. Here she is. Yep. Osborne Fire Finder. Tells us where to go if you see smoke, which brings us to... On, off. Send, receive. Reports twice a day, first thing in the morning, so we know that Bigfoot didn't get you at 7:00 a.m. Next thing, 4:00 p.m., uh, weather reports, humidity measurements, last rain. Fifteen days ago. We need to have that. So, you got no water, Wi-Fi, or plumbing, but you got electricity. like I said. The heater's right there and the wood stove if you need it. Okay. And the garbage? Oh, Hal at the store lets us dump it in the back of his truck. -Okay. You okay? -Oh, yeah. Routine is key. Your head needs that. Three months is a long time, so... Be on that radio, 7:00 sharp. Scope, lunch, second report, supper, maybe a book, then bed. Rinse and repeat. -Stick to the routine. -Stick to the routine. Yeah. Oh, sorry, it's been a long time since we had a female volunteer. That's totally fine. I get it. Yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you again, Earl. You're a good guy. I see why Nickie's so sad you drifted. Oh, uh-- well, as you know, uh, Corinne is, uh-- She hates that Nickie's gay, yeah. Corinne is a believer, but she doesn't hate my sister. Mm. Anything you need, you call. Yep. Where's the thing? Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Earl, is that you? Earl, is that you? Shit! Shit, shit, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. -Hey, hey, I just want to talk. -Mike, how the fuck? Look... Baby. Mike. -You really can't be here. -I just love-- Damn it, Kate, stop! Babe, come on! Stop! Kate! Kate, stop. - Let go. Leave me alone. - Kate, stop. -Go away. -I'm sorry. - Please, come back. - Kate. No. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay, okay. You're okay, you're okay... Okay. You're okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay. Katie, my lady. You're 30 minutes late. 7:00 a.m., Kate. I'm sorry, Earl. I'm really sorry. You need to follow protocol, Kate. Of course. Yes, I will. Who else knows I'm up here? Uh, just ILD and the townies, no one outside of this immediate area, really. Mm-hmm. And who's closest to me? Uh, Reggie Banfield, retired doctor. He's got a cabin about a half a mile north from you. Moody, but a good guy. Used to volunteer. Listen, Kate, if you're having doubts, now is the time. Can't have you deserting your post in the middle of the night. No, no. Absolutely, I could do this. Okay, I believe you. Over and out. Hey, this is your pep talk video to remind you that you are the shit. That you've got this. That you are queen of the mountain. That there is nothing that you can't do. And you know why? Because you're my badass friend. I love you. Play this whenever you miss me. - I love you. - I love you. Okay. - Thank you. - Yep. Out of food already? -Yeah. -You're a hungry girl. Uh, ants got my food. Oh, I've been there, believe me. Ranger Dan. I work with Earl. Welcome to the mountain. Uh, yeah, I-- I saw you the other day at the work yard. Yeah, but, you know, we didn't officially meet. Kate Riley. Hmm, I hope you plan to hustle right back up there, young lady. Reg. This ball of sunshine is Reggie Banfield. -He's your neighbor. -Oh, right. Earl mentioned. Uh, I think I saw you in here the other day. Yeah, bought my wife a birthday cake. -Happy belated to her. -She's dead. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm not. She left me millions. She-- You're funny. Ah. Uh, tha-- that's my joke. Sorry, we don't know each other well enough yet. She was a super lady, ma'am. I'm sure she was. Hal, from now on, why don't you put anything she needs on the, uh, station's tab? Really nice of you. Thank you. You just let us know if you need anything. Will do. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Excuse me. Do you have a shovel I could borrow? Ah, yeah. You're lucky. I just helped dig a fire line last month. Just go ahead and leave it with Hal on your next trash trip. -Will do. -Oh, sorry. Excuse me. No worries. Thank you very much, Ranger Dan. Yeah, you betcha. Excuse me? Well, hey. We're a little lost. Looking for Raglan Peak. Can you put that out, please? That's a fire hazard. This? Sure, totally. Oh, man. Shit. Got it. Does she look like Vicky to you? That's exactly what I was thinking. I thought so. Where did you guys pitch last night? We were just around around that bend back there. There's no campfires up here. Yeah, we had to do a little snuggling. You could've joined. Raglan Peak is eight miles along the saddle. No loop, out and back. Just you up here? Maybe we'll see you on the way back. Okay. Okay... There you go. Maybe we'll just pack it. Okay. It was against protocol, Kate. That's not how we do it. - Who cares? I put out a fire. - I care. I commend the effort, but you missed the afternoon report. -You need to stay in that tower. -Come on, Earl. It was too close to the tower. Relative humidity was very low, atmosphere unstable, so vertical air movement was a factor. The fire was too high. If I called it in by the time anyone got there, it would've been out of control. It was the right call, Kate. But you need to stay in my tower, over and out. Whatever, bro, I nailed it. ...Northern Idaho and Eastern Washington for Wednesday, July 7th. In Clark... What do you want, Miss Riley? I put out a fire. Well-- - I'm just-- I'm between jobs... - Ah! ...so, just here for three months. Oh, just, uh-- I found the longer you stay on the mountain, the deeper the mountain stays in you. Mm, weird thing to say, but okay. No, I'm... Just came for the peace and quiet. There's no peace in nature. And, uh, being all alone up here may be silent... it won't be quiet. Hmm. -How long you know Earl? -Uh, three years. Yeah, since he started as a lookout. I even did it for a couple of summers when I got up here, 20 years ago. Ooh, 20 years? I wasn't alone the whole time. Had my wife for nearly half of it. That's Bunny. Now, what I call her, anyway. -Hmm. -This is her knife. Uh, morning report was stable? - High pressure, yeah. - Well, uh, Have a bite. I'll tell you about her. That the garden where you grew her medicine? It is. Soil up here is like the Hubei Region. Worms love it, so there's plenty of castings. Gets those rare Chinese herbs real potent. So, I made her tea to drink, instead of those damn pills. -And it worked? -Her doctors, my colleagues, gave her two years. She went 12, thanks to me. Kate? Are you okay? Y-- you went down. That really jolted you. -Sorry. -Wait here, uh-- Help me! Help me! No, no, no! No! Y-- y-- you're okay. It's okay. Uh, take a tablespoon of this, steep it, drink it. It'll relax those nerves. -I-- I should go. -Yeah, yeah. Get back up in that tower. Somebody's in here. Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Oh! I thought it was jammed. I didn't mean to scare you. I mean, people use it all the time when they hike this area. Yeah, I-- I-- I heard that. I'm so sorry, dear. No, no, it's-- it's, uh, totally fine. -Have at it. -Oh, thank you. Last time I went in the bushes, I sat on some nettles. My clacker hurt for a week. Oh, my goodness. - Smell this. - Yeah. Hey, Reg. Oh, you gotta be kidding. What do you want? Oh, oh, nothing, nothing. I-- I just... I just wanted not to be alone for a second. Me neither. It's just how it is sometimes. It's not really up to us. Air pressure's s-- stable-- high. There's no systems threatening, so-- Earl's made it clear, you don't leave the tower. For good reason. Let me guess, is it you-- you have a problem up there you can't handle? No. No. I-- I just wanted to say hello. Oh, that's nice, but... I don't know you, Kate. We're not friends. There's a reason I'm up here. I don't want company. - Look-- - Hm. Try my tea. You signed up for this, Kate. Keep my mountain safe. My mountain now, too. Talk to me about Reggie. Uh, Reggie? He's, uh, got a chip. Lonely guy. Blames himself for not being able to save his wife. How'd she die? Cancer, but before I got here. So, you never met her? No, but I met everyone she's ever met. And that woman sounds like she's a sweetheart. But you don't know for sure that she died of cancer? You just heard that? What's this about, Kate? You okay? Yeah, he just lives close. I don't know him. Look, Kate, I know it's not easy being up there alone after what happened. But stick to the routine. Helped me when I came back from Kabul. Reggie can be unfriendly sometimes, but he's harmless. You're safe, Kate. We'll talk in the morning, okay? Over and out. Take this. Take this. Mike-- Mike... She had a restraining order, I'm gonna need you to calm down! - For the wrists. - Hmm. The program won't tolerate violence toward other-- Come on! God. Katie, my lady. Come here, kiddo. I'll help put your swimsuit on. Oh, no. No! Oh, God. Okay. Goddammit! Kate? Kate? Hey, hey. Okay. - You all right? Come on. - Shit. Mm-hmm. Here you go. Here you go, oh. Oh. - All right. - I'm sorry. It's just my, um... my heater broke and I'm, uh, tired of being cold, but I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here, so... Oh, I'm, uh-- I'm sorry about last week. I was a real horse's ass. I have bad days when I miss her like hell. Let's hit that stump, huh? Come on, uh, get the feel for it, uh... Uh... I think your mistake is what a lot of people do, they muscle the stump and muscle it, but you're-- you're not letting the axe do its job. If you give it the chance... to get some... Ah. It has its own power to it, huh? -Okay. Okay. -Give it a try. Good, good. Yeah, op-- open your legs a bit. -A bit, just in case-- -Okay. -Like that? -Good, straight back. -And up. -Okay. And bring it down. Good, good. All right, let's, uh... get this up here-- whoa, whoa, hold on, just-- Oh, sorry, yes. All right, hold it right for the-- aim for that tip right there. - Okay? - Okay. And line it up. - I did it! - There you go! -Look at that, would ya? -I did it! Whoa, wait a minute. Pack chased her off. - Is she dangerous? - She's sick and hungry. Can't get more dangerous than that. Get outta here. Go on. Go on. Get out. Wanna pick up some repellant next trip, huh? Oh, I, um-- -What? -I dropped my keys in the pit. So, I'm stuck up here. -In the-- in the shitter? -Yeah. Well, use my place to dump your trash and the-- the house is stocked. -Plenty of food and water. -Going somewhere? Uh, I'll be with my grandkids down in Pendleton for a couple of months. Why? Are you okay? Are you-- Oh, yeah, no, that'll be-- that sounds really nice. Yeah. No, it will be. Hey, uh, you try my tea? I did. It did the trick. Uh-huh, anytime. -That's what I do. -Yeah. Hey, this is your pep talk video to remind you that you are the shit. That you got this. That you are queen of the mountain... Fuck! No! Is the bar open? Hi. Yes. Come on in. -Oh, my gosh. -Oh, thank you so much. Oh, look at this penthouse view. Oh, it's pretty beautiful. - Oh, man, I'm moving in. - Please do. I haven't seen anyone on the trail, and my neighbor's been gone for two weeks. -I'm losing my mind up here. -Oh, poor doll. I couldn't do this. I mean, I like people too much. -I like to talk. -That's music to my ears. Wait, they fell in the shitter? Oh, I've had much better luck in there. -It is a tight squeeze. -Oh, yeah. I used to zip myself all the way up in a sleeping bag when I was a kid. So did I! I did that, too. Yeah. Oh, man. All right. What's this? Okay, that's not as exciting as you think. My neighbor fancies himself a shaman. That's herbal tea. For my nerves. - ah, my husband... - ...loves tea. Me, I prefer a good old cup of coffee. -I'll make you some. -Ah, thanks. How long you two been married? Uh, we're not anymore. I got tired of his fists. Earl, I snapped some pics. Sent a violation report to ILD. Fire on that campsite Kate found. When'd you go there? Well, you know, you go when it happens, like they say. Could've been bad. She definitely saved your ass. Fuck off, Dan. Oh, shit. Oh, shit, shit, shit. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Come in dispatch, this is Alpha Mount. Smoke spotted, over. Copy, Alpha Mount. Landmark? Halfway up Brush Ridge, E slope. Copy. reading? Uh, 21 degrees plus 30, angle it's-- sorry, uh, vertical angle is 14 degrees, so, seven-- nope, seven and a half. Copy. Seven and a half miles. Can you see the smoke base? Negative. Plume gray, moderate volume wind southwest at four miles per hour. Copy. Last rain, Alpha? Jesus Christ. Uh... - 37 days. - Copy that, Alpha. Fire number one for Delta Brush Ridge. Copy 14 Delta Brush Ridge. Okay, thank you, Alpha. Alert sent. In transit. Over and out. Shit. Where are you guys? Come on. Here we go. The fuck are you doing? Dispatch, can you suppress with retardant? What's the perimeter? Alpha Mount, we have negative confirmation of these coordinates. Are you crazy? I'm looking at the smoke right now. Negative confirmation, Alpha. No smoke, no fire. Over. It's right fucking there. You're right on top of it. Miss Riley, this is deputy Weaver. You are on an open channel. I'm switching over to frequency 13 now. Thank you, dispatch. Over and out. Copy. Lucky little thing, huh? Roger that, Earl. Over and out. Earl, those coordinates are right. I've been staring at the same spot for 30 minutes. I-- Listen to me very carefully, Kate. I will bring you up on charges. Those are real people in those planes. It is a risk every time they go up, fire or no fire. There was smoke. I swear there was smoke. These are families, Kate. Do you hear me? -They have families. -I know, Earl, God damn it. You continue to threaten the trust I have rebuilt in this town. There was smoke, Earl! There was. I can't fire you. I got no one else. From now on, Dan will be taking over your reports. I'm filing a citation with ILD and US Forest Service for your transgression, so it's on record. Please, Earl. I just... I just made a mistake. No, Kate, I did. Over and out. Fuck! Fuck. What is happening to me? Tell Earl I don't need a sitter. Kate. I hear you. He's on tilt. I-- look, I don't want to be up here, either. So then don't be up here. He's my boss. I mean, I need this job, but trust me, I'm with you, all right? There's a reason he's all worked up. Now, you fucked up. You know that, right? Yeah, and I also put out a fire in my first week. - I saved his ass. - I know. So did I. He didn't even file a report. That's what I'm saying. He's distraught. It's not about you. So what's his problem? Earl doesn't want what happened to him to happen to you. Earl almost burned this whole town down. His first year, he's a lookout, just like you. Runs down into town to see Corinne. He wasn't gone long. Just half an hour, tops. But he missed that first curl of smoke and... It spreads fast. He came back up, but he didn't need to be at 6300 feet to see it was a crown fire. He called it in. But we missed the jump and... look. Almost took the whole mountain. The whole town. And he lost his buddy, the pilot who went down there in the drop. I guess if your wife's daddy has a state seat in Boise, it all just... goes away. Truth is, you know... who knows if the fire would have been any less costly if Earl had called it in. I mean... you can't contain that kind of fury... once it starts. No, you can't. I've been beat up. More than once. I didn't know why you were on this mountain cape, but I knew it had nothing to do with lookouts or fires or... I'm sorry. Yeah. Lots of bruises and breaks as a kid. I broke my wrists deflecting blows. Sick of being broken. It's time to plant my feet and land a punch. You should stay right here. It's beautiful. Maybe I will. Tower's growing on me. Let me ask you something. What happens when your neighbor's food runs out? You know how to shoot? You mean to hunt? I mean to not need anyone for anything. You know, I, uh... hate guns. -Mike had guns. -Yeah. You learn how to shoot, you won't have to run anymore. They keep a rifle up there? My uncle exposed himself to me in the pool house. Soon after, he started crawling into bed with me. I was 12. He shot my dog for peeing in his car. Just pulled over and left him for the maggots. Wish I knew how to shoot back then. God, I suck at this. Nah, you're scared of the weapon because you're scared of its power. Just surrender. Give in to its nature. You surrender to your nature, you get your power. Same with the gun. Got it? Try again. Okay. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Almost. Oh, you clipped it. Go, go, go, go, go. -Yes. -I got it. -I did get it. -Oh, my gosh. So, you say your neighbor lives alone. Mm-hmm. -He doesn't have a lady? -No, no way. All he talks about is his dead wife, so, not exactly a turn on for the ladies. Uh... -Where'd you get these? -His bedroom. You didn't have any of that tea, did you? Good. I don't know about your nerves, but I bet it would have relaxed your legs. -We gotta tell Earl. -We? I shouldn't even be here. You know, hanging with you, raiding the cabin of a guy who's lived here 20 years, taking his rifle. No way. You get fired, I get arrested. No, yeah, you're right. -I'll tell him. -Nah. Don't be dense, Kate. He's in on it. Both him and Reggie. Come on, Bertha. He's so by the books guy. There's no way he doesn't say something. Makes no sense. It does if all he wants is you out of that tower. It does if he never wanted you there in the first place. Kate! Ow. Oh, was there a party last night? Barometer's low. 29. Yeah, I mean, we'll probably get strikes tonight. Be careful. And, oh, listen, maybe you could just tell Earl I came up, if he-- if he asked. I mean, these-- these trips up here are kicking my ass. I keep a secret. Okay. Thanks. Ah, you got my note! Bertha, you shouldn't be here. Yeah. Well... if he gets to steal your underwear, we get to drink his booze. Hey. Mm. Mm. Codgers like him... need to get cut down like old growth. Yeah. -Bad things find me. -Nah, nah, nah, nah. That's something Kate says to avoid power. Like the gun. Just say it. You'll feel better. - I'm back. - Yeah. Now we're cooking with gas. Yeah. You're bad. Bad finds bad. Yeah. Yeah. There's lots of us. The world is filled with bad people. Isn't that good to know? Huh? Rotten. Like you. Like Reggie. I'm his wife. He says it was cancer, but he lies. He murdered me. He's gonna kill you, too. He won't. Watch Earl and anyone with him. Don't let him take back that tower. Don't let him get her. Whoo! Hey. I missed you. I don't know if you're checking your messages, but I got a day off. I'm thinking about coming to see you. You can give me a tour. It'll be great. Um, so, I guess I'll just surprise you. Okay. Well, I love you. Bye. Fuck a duck. From ISP. Those two kids from Wallace have been missing over a month. Clearing out says they took our trail to Raglan Peak. Let's go. Yeah, but I mean, Kate's gonna call in, like, 10 minutes. Yeah, we'll be up there after Reggie's. -Reggie? -He's back today. He's taking over for Kate. You're not gonna get him out of the house. Yeah, that's why you're coming. You're buddies, he listens to you. Kate's fine, man. Her reports are on time. They're accurate. It's been seven weeks since she fucked up. -She's good. -No. She's a risk. She's coming down. You're not gonna lose your job, man. Relax. You know people. What was that? What, you want me to spell it out? We all know why you still have a job. What-- hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm just saying, you fucked up, too, right? You fucked up and you got a second chance. That's all I'm saying. Shit. She needs to come off that mountain. Not safe keeping her up there. I'd have done it sooner if I had someone. Now I do. I told you. Here they come. They're coming for your tower. Anybody here? Hello? Nickie. Kate. Oh, wait, it's on. Hey. Kate. Yes. Hi. - How are you? - I'm good. I want to see you. How do I-- how do I get up there? There's a map on the wall. Yeah. See you soon. Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I'm gonna, uh, radio Charlie. Oh, fuck. Come in, dispatch. This is Dan. Copy. Go ahead. The animals got at it after. ...Charlie here, we found on of the missing... Posterior entry. He was running. before the saddle on Raglan trail. Definitely didn't see it coming. He was ambushed. Copy, Point Five and North Saddle. Any sign of the other kid? No, I don't know, shit. That's a good question. I have no fucking clue. 10-4. We'll get SO down there. Over and out. Someone broke in and took Reggie's rifle. If he was back, we'd have heard from him by now. I'll drop you there, and then check on Kate. Yeah, but where's that other kid? Not here and didn't go home. Maybe he's been out there like an animal for a month? You hit Reggie's again, he won't be black on ammo either. Let's go. What the... Hello? Bunny's knife. Shit. Come on, now. Oh! I don't touch your crap! God damn it. Jesus, mercy. Somebody-- No. Stop! Stop! Please. Please. No. Please, no! He's home. Hurry. Reggie! Reggie! J-- Jesus. Reggie. Wh-- -Hey, Danny. -What-- Danny, someone's shooting at me. -Who? From where? -I don't know. -I don't know. -Shit. I don't know what-- they're toying with me. Be careful! Oh, come on, help me. We got a dead kid in the clearing. And his crazy friend's out there in the woods. What? That's where Bertha's buried. Enough of your bullshit, Reggie. I am not gonna get shot out here. Where's the latch on this thing? -I did all I could. -Yes, you did. You don't know what love is. You-- you condescending me? Are you condescending me? -Help me out! -You're hurting me. You're hurting my leg, you're-- Danny! Uh, Hey. -What happened? -Me happened. For Bertha. For me. Dan, do you copy? Dan, do you copy? Oh, no, no, no, no. Please, no. Nickie! What are you doing here? Dan, do you copy? Oh, shit. What is this crazy shit? Kate! Girl, you owe me, big time. No, no, no, no, no. No. Kate! Kate, are you up there? Hey. Oh, my God. Wha-- Fuck this shit. I'm gonna go get help! All right, girl, You got this shit. Nick, it's not safe. Go back! We gotta help Kate. Nickie, there is a shooter loose. Go back to your car right now. Nickie! There is a dead man up on the toilet, and somebody ate his motherfucking foot. In here, like they're hiding him. What is going on here? Earl, what is going on? Earl, please, what's going on? Dan, I need you at the tower now. Where's Kate? Motherfucker, answer me! I hear it. I hear his walkie! Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan. What the hell? -Where is he? -What the hell? When was the last time you saw Kate? A-- a while. Nick, please. The fuck, Earl. Who's out there? Kate! Is she dead, Earl? Is she dead? She left, Nick. She's safe. Where she-- hey! Jesus. Kate. Kate, I love you. I love you. Don't let them take back that tower. - Say something! - Don't them get her. Say something! Run. No! Kate, please! Kate! I'm locking it up. I'm taking her away. Hey, no! Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Kate, no! Jesus fucking Christ. Earl! She's right under me. Can you see her? Yeah. Well, what's she's doing? She-- she's just sitting there. Shit. Earl! Fuck. Leave him alone, Kate! Get out of there! - Get out of there! - Shit. Shit! God! Fuck. Nickie. Earl, let her go! Earl! Are you okay? I will do it! We're gonna get you some help, Kate. -Are you okay? -I'm gonna die. Well, then I guess, you're staying up here. -Oh, shit. -Come on. I got you, I got you. Okay. Just lock it. Let's go, let's go, let's go. -Sorry, Nickie. -I got you. Got you, I got you. I got you, I got you. -I'm so sorry, Nickie. -It's okay.
