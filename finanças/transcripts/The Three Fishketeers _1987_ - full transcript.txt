[music playing] CHORUS: (SINGING) Something is fishy down here. Amidst the motion in the ocean. You don't know what you'll see at the bottom of the sea, like a seahorse race that's getting into gear. Camptown fishies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah. Camptown racetrack, five miles long, oh the doo-dah day. CHORUS: Something is fishy and all wet in this musical, undersea menagerie where the song is underscored in ways you've never heard before, like clams that play on built-in castanets. [castanets clapping] The bass sings bass-- A-bubba duh-boo. CHORUS: --the tuna, tenor-- La, la, la. CHORUS: --and the shrimp soprano sing in harmony. Bo do dee-oh, doh dee oh dee oh doh doh. CHORUS: Something is fishy down here. Amidst the motion in the ocean. The lobsters and the turtles and the starfish all agree that something is fishy. Something is wishy-washy. Something is fishy at the bottom of the sea. (SPEAKING) Oh, rot. Rubbish. I'm miserable. I am miserable. And I am a fool. Why am I here? You're looking for fame, fortune, adventure-- just like the rest of us. Well, we haven't found it. We're swimming around in circles. Straight line, as far as I can see. There ain't no circles. Aren't any circles. But Finner, you just said there was. Were. Come on, guys. What's the hold up? Will you slow down, Toby? I'm tired. I'm hungry. You're always hungry, Gillas. And you're always tired. Well, I can't help it. My tail hurts. My left fin has a charley horse. Every scale in my body aches. I've got to rest. Again? Aw, come on. Just a little farther. We're bound to run into someone who needs a hero. You should've stayed at home. No one cares about us out here. No one cared about us back there, either. That's why we left. Stop talking with your mouth full, Gillas. It's rude. You're mighty bossy, Finner. Well, I'm supposed to be bossy. I'm the boss, the leader. And don't you ever forget it. So lead, already. Let's go. Not yet, Toby. Grumpy, too. Well, I can't just float around here, waiting. I'm going to scout around. [cheerful music playing] [foreboding music playing] Gosh, it sure is deserted around here. Where'd everybody go? Gee, how can we be heroes when there isn't anybody around to help. Huh. What's that? TIKA: (SINGING) La la, la la. [humming] Oh, wow! A damsel in distress! Wait til I tell the guys. [music playing] Ta-da! [screams] Oh! FINNER: Never fear, dear. We're here. Who are you? We, my dear, are The Three Fishketeers. You've heard of us, I hope. (IN FRENCH ACCENT) No, I'm afraid not. Aw. Well, then allow us to introduce ourselves. [music playing] (SINGING) The Three Fishketeers are we. We're brilliant. Brawny. And brave. Looking for villains to vanquish and damsels that need to be saved, The Three Fishketeers are we. Three heroes from under the sea, who stand up for good like heroes should so the oceans will be free. The Three Fishketeers are we. I'm Toby. I'm Gillas. I'm Finner. We may have been misfits before. But soon we'll be coming up winners. The Three Fishketeers are we, three heroes from under the sea. We're off on a quest for fame and success and a date with destiny. The Three Fishketeers are we, trying so hard to be humble. But it's not always easy, you see, when you don't ever stumble or bumble. FINNER AND GILLAS: The Three Fishketeers are we, three heroes from under the sea. We don't like to fight but sometimes we might for a place in history. (SPEAKING) Here comes the vile octopus to munch the tender youth. Oh, help. Save me from those cruel tentacles. I'll save you, Toby. Oh, help! Help! [evil laughter] I'm coming. [evil laughter] [laughter] (SINGING) The Three Fishketeers are we! [honk] (SPEAKING) Sorry, fellas. Sorry, fellows? Oh, boy. And now, mademoiselle, what is your name? And how may we serve you in your hour of need? Well, my name is Tika. But this is not my hour of need. Maybe if we wait an hour or two. But I am merely tending my garden. Well, can't we vanquish a villain for you? Or save you from a fate worse that death? Or rescue someone? Retrieve a stolen treasure? Pull a few weeds? Ha ha, well, I would hate to see such valiant and courageous fish go without a good deed to do. Perhaps there is something. What? Anything, tell us. Can we eat lunch first? Look up there. See that lovely pearl trapped in the coral? FINNER: Yes, yes. TIKA: Well, I have seen it often. And I think, would this not make a lovely centerpiece for my garden? A centerpiece for your garden? That's it? Oh, I-- I am sorry. It was a silly idea. Well, it's not silly. It-- it's small. But it's a start. Huh? Well, quite right. We will proceed immediately. Right after lunch. I'm going to go size things up. Wow! Big pearl-- it must have been some oyster. Where is everybody? Hey, fellas, come on. This will be easy. Finner! Hm. Quite a predicament. TOBY: Gillas! Hold your seahorses, hot shot. I'm coming. A plan is in order, a carefully thought out plan. Hey, guys. Stop talking. Help me push. [straining] Hm. [thunk] [drumroll] Charge! [boing] [screaming] Where is he going? [snap] TOBY: Gosh, it's dark in here and cold and clammy. [slurp] Now wait just a minute, Shelly. I'm no clam dinner. Let me out of here. Tickle, tickle, tickle. [muffled laughter] Coochie, coochie, coo. [laughter] Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah. [blows raspberry] What are you guys floating around for? Let's get the pearl for the girl. I'm still thinking of a plan. Think, think, think, this could take all year. Gillas, help me. OK. With your size, this ought to be easy. All it needs is a little shove. It's just stuck. [bong] (CHUCKLING) So am I. Huh? Guess this little old hole was a mite small for big old me. Oh, no. Here we go again. [drumroll] Charge! [boing] [screaming] I've seen an idea about to strike. [crash] [snap] TOBY: Not again. All right. You asked for it. Mary had a little clam who liked to ho, ho, ho. And every time the claim was tickled-- tickle, tickle, tickle-- [muffled laughter] --he let his dinner go. [laughter] It looks so complicated. Complicated? Simplicity, my dear, physics-- when an unmoving object is struck by a moving object, the force of the moving object is transferred to the nonmoving. And it continues the course began by the first object. He means I'm going to hit it with my nose. Hope it don't hurt. That's the last one. All set, chief. Then Gillas, charge! [drumroll] [boink] Hooray! It worked. It should settle right in the middle of-- [snap] --your garden. All right, Shelly, cough it up. That's telling him, boy. [squish] Ah! There's no bottom. We lost it for good. Why I oughtta-- [laughter] Come back here, you hard headed-- [gasp] Fellas! [foreboding music] Ah, the bitter taste of defeat. G-G-Gillas, fellas-- Not Now Toby. But-- but-- It's too late. It's hopeless. B-B-Barracuda! A baracuda? Baracuda? Oh, poppycock. [gasp] Barracuda! [screaming] Great Neptune! Wait for-- [thud] (GIGGLING) Sea tea? Oh, I'd love a cup. Thank you. Finner! Someone do something! I'm coming, Finner. [chomp] What happened? Bravo! He is safe. Pretty fancy swimming, heh heh. [gasp] He's coming back! [gasp] [swishing] Oo-ee, that was a close one. Where did he go? [panting] It would appear that we have eluded him. Yahoo! He's gone! So is Tika. What? She was here just a second ago. Look, there she is. [gasp] GILLAS: She went the other way! He's gonna get her! We've got to help! Come on! Help! Whew, [inaudible]. [screaming] [screaming] [thud] [thud] He's not giving up. What do we do? Oh, oh, give me a few minutes. I'll think of something. [thud] We don't have a few minutes. Come on! [thud] [screaming] [chomping] Pull! Ah! Oh! He's after Toby! Someone help him! We'll never catch up. Swim, Toby! Swim! [chomp] Hurry, Gillas. We've got to help Toby. [gasp] [chomp] [crash] [crash] [thud] [crash] Toby's in there! [rumbling] [screaming] TIKA: Oh, no! [somber music playing] FINNER: Poor Toby. He gave his life and thereby saved ours. TOBY: Tickle, tickle, tickle. [muffled laughter] Coochie, coochie, coo. [laughter] Toby. He's alive. How wonderful! FINNER: Toby! TIKA: Are you all right? I thought I was a gonner. Simply smashing, man. You're still with us. I'm so glad you're OK. Did we get that old barracuda? Well, no. He just swam away. The falling rock scared him. Oh. You are all heroes Heroes? Us? No, we're not. We didn't vanquish the villain. We lost your pearl. And we helped put your life in serious danger-- hardly heroes. You Three Fishketeers are the most courageous, valiant fish I have ever met. Not only are you so wonderfully kind and generous, but each of you risked your very lives to save mine. Don't you see? No three fish could be braver. Well, she could be right. Hm. You really think we were heroes? Every inch. Yahoo! You hear that, guys? Heroes. Finally. Well, mademoiselle, I guess this is where we say our goodbyes. Where will you go now? Well, it's a big ocean. I'm sure we're needed somewhere. Right, chief. Let's go. Can we eat dinner first? Eat dinner? Well, only if I get to rest. Rest? GILLAS: You're always resting. FINNER: Well, you're always eating. Guys, come on. Oh, quite right. Goodbye, my dear. Au revoir, my three fishketeers. So long, ma'am. Goodbye, Tika. Au revoir. A bientot. [french] [music playing]
