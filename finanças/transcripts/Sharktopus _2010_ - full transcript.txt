( water bubbling ) ( suspenseful music plays ) ( people shriek ) ( cell phone chimes ) - You're texting again? - Huh? Come on, put that down and swim with me. In the ocean? There's fish out there. - Your loss. - ( chimes ) ( chimes ) Oh my God. Bree! Bree! Shark! Bree, there's a shark! ( shrieking ) Oh my God! Somebody help her, please! There's a shark! Bree, shark! Oh my God. ( bellows ) ( creature calling ) ( pings ) Oh my God. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - What just happened? - There was a shark. - Oh my God. - ( elevator bell dings ) - ( keyboard cIacking ) Welcome to Blue Water. This better be good, Sands. l stood up an admiral to be here. Trust me, Commander. You're gonna wanna see this. What are we looking at here? S-1 1's been fitted with cameras. We received these images 10 minutes ago. My God. Very "National Geographic," isn't it? - Freeze it. - ( beeps ) See? The girl got away. Why didn't S-1 1 go after her? Because we jerked its leash. We told it to behave. - Come again? - Like a shark-- let me let my daughter explain. Like a shark, S-1 1 can sense electrical impulses, helping it navigate. We manipulate this ability by transmitting focused electrical charges to a series of receptors implanted in S-1 1's cerebral cortex. l have no idea what she just said. S-1 1 is now totally under our control. Blue Water Corp. has just created the Navy's next superweapon. Sands, you crafty SOB. You did it. Was there any doubt? Baby girl, bring S-1 1 home. - ( beeps ) - ( S-1 1 bellows ) Sir, we've got S-1 1 on an intercept path of a fast moving vesseI. Change course. No, take it in closer. Commander, the swimmer was a chance encounter. S-1 1 still needs more testing. l procured millions of dollars of taxpayer money to develop that thing. Before Blue Water gets one more cent, l better see it perform. But the external interface is a prototype. lf something were to happen-- What did you have in mind, Commander? S-1 1 was designed to go where the Navy can't, right? Sneak into hostile waters, hunt down drug runners and pirate vesseIs. So you want us to treat that craft like the enemy? Move in tight and pursue without being seen. - Dad? - Make me proud, pumpkin. l told you to stop calling me that. Make me proud, Nicole. ( pats ) ( beeping ) - lsn't this fun? - Yeah, man. - ( Iaughs ) - ( shouts ) Hold on! ( beeps ) You can breathe now. - ( thuds ) - ( moans ) Whoa. What was that? You hit something? Whoa! ( alarm beeping ) What's going on? - S-1 1 isn't responding to command. - ( keyboard cIacking ) The propeller must've damaged the externaI interface. l told you it wasn't ready for adverse conditions. Get the system back online now. lt's not working. l'm engaging the kill switch. - ( high-pitched whine ) - In three... two... - one. - lt's too late, Nicole. Look. - ( alarm blaring ) - Woman: We've lost our signal. - Oh my God. - What just happened? S-1 1 escaped. ( groans ) So you ever see anybody fall off one of these things? Fall? Nah. l seen a guy jump once, though. Wife Ieft him so he took a nosedive from 60 floors up. - That's horrible. - Ain't so bad. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Feel the wind in your hair. - ( sighs ) - SpIat! ( laughs ) lt's all over with. l can think of worse ways to go anyhow. Like what? Like falling face first in a French fryer. - ( mimics sizzling ) - Thanks. l'll have that image in my head aII day. Huh? ( groans ) How about getting jammed into a wood chipper? Whoa! Oh no! Not Iike this! ( screaming ) - ( man grunting ) - ( S-1 1 bellows ) Signals from the tracking implant are fading, but it Iooks Iike S-1 1's heading south. Commander. You just unleashed an eight-legged man-eating shark on the world. A minor setback. lf you're thinking of going back into that Iab and creating a new freak, forget it. l'm cutting off all Blue Water funding untiI you get S-1 1 back. Fail, and that's not all l'll cut off. Relax, Commander. We'll get S-1 1 , even if we have to go to the ends of the earth. Okay, teIemetry shows he's heading to Mexico. Let's get a team down there now. ( birds coo ) Any changes? Hard to say. The tracking impIant was damaged when S-1 1 ripped off its control plate. But we're still receiving ghost signals indicating S-1 1's presence in the coastaI waters. Can we pinpoint its location? Not exactly, Dr. Sands. But S-1 1 is here, and for some reason, it's sticking around. Migratory instincts. It'II feed aIong the coast a few days and then move on. - This is us, sir. - We're here? l chartered a smaller craft too for the recovery mission. A fast one, l hope. - lt will do the job, sir. - Good. Sir, I think we shouId also contact Andy Flynn. Flynn? He's here in Mexico? Since you Iet him go two years ago. l didn't let him go, Santos. l fired his ass 'cause he demanded a raise-- a big one. He's a greedy bastard, no doubt, but he knows these waters better than anyone. And he knows what we're up against. lf you want S-1 1 back, Andy Flynn is your best shot. ( groans ) All right, find him. ( women speaking Spanish ) Who's ready for some tequila ball? - Ready, gringo? - Whoo! You missed. Let's go, ladies. ( woman speaking Spanish ) - There you go. - Gracias. Andy Flynn. Still drinking that rotgut, huh? Santos. What's up, brother? What are you doing here? Looking for you. No, you didn't. - Blue Water wants you back. - Not a chance, man. Not a chance. - If it's about the money-- - Look, it's always about the money. AII right? That idiot Sands, he won't pay me what l'm worth, so l'm retired. - Not anymore, amigo. - ( sighs ) S-1 1 escaped. ( metal detector beeping ) ( metal detector whines ) ( screaming ) Please help me! Please! No! Please! Please! ( screams ) No, don't! No no no no no no! No! No! ( S-1 1 bellows ) Hey, guys. So glad you could join us, Mr. Flynn. - Do we have a location? - Sands: No. But like an octopus, he's very territorial. It won't stray far. You understand you are to capture S-1 1 , not terminate it, right? Well, your fish might have other ideas. S-1 1 can be controlled, Mr. Flynn. Let me show you. We call these interface darts. Once attached, l can access S-1 1's bioimplants with my computer allowing me to direct its movements. Like a remote control toy. Sounds easy. It won't be easy, beIieve me. First, we have to tranquilize S-1 1 . That'll make him docile. And then he won't resist commands. The tranqs will bring S-1 1 to the surface, and then we can hit it with the interface dart. Why don't we just nail it underwater with your dart? They're more accurate if shot from a grenade Iauncher. And since we only have two darts, accuracy is key. Once I estabIish a Iink, l can then navigate S-1 1 to open waters. Then our techs on the yacht will be able to fix the interface. So what do you say? Are you game? Yeah. 100 grand, 200 more upon completion, why not? You think a great deal of yourself, don't you, FIynn? Yeah, you know what l think? I think you're a money-grubbing Neanderthal. And the word on you is you like cheap women and cheaper booze. ls that right? 300 grand or l go back to the pool. Fine, 300 grand. But only if you bring S-1 1 back alive. Otherwise you get nothing. This is a bad idea, Sands. We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives. That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering. Damage it and heads will roll, Mr. FIynn. Yours will be first. Fine. Get your stuff ready. We're going to the boat. Santos and l will meet you at the dock. Dónde está señor Kingsberry? ( sighs ) Ay ay ay . Classy. You Kingsberry? Well, the locals call me Pez. What can l do for you, angel? First, Pez, you can stop staring at my rack. They're just boobs. They're not gonna get up and dance or anything. Second... you can tell me about this. How'd you find me? It's what I do. l'm Stacy Everheart, an investigative reporter with CNE. - And this is my cameraman Bones. - Hey, buddy. ( sighs ) You sent that to our station two days ago. lt was a joke. - A joke. - That's right. - Oh, we Iike jokes. - Sorry to waste your time. You're lying. A creature fitting this description was sighted just last week in California. Now it's in VaIIarta and you've seen it. Well, l wish to the devil l hadn't. I can't cIose my eyes without imagining that-- that thing squirming towards me. It's gotten so bad l can't take my boat out. No, l'm done with that thing. There's nothing you can-- What do you wanna know? All right, Pez. Can we stop? Come on. We gotta burn off those enchiladas from last night. But we're on vacation, and it's Mexico. l think it's against the law to jog in Mexico. Fine. You're gonna have to save your breath anyway. You'll be screaming your lungs out soon. Wait. Why? Two words-- bungee jumping. l found a great spot over the ocean. So not funny. You know l'm afraid of heights. Gonna have to get over that sooner or later. Today's the day. All right, tell you what. Do this and spend the rest of the day at the spa. Mud-baths? Seaweed wraps? - Sure. - Okay, you're on. ( birds squawking ) - ( Iaughs ) - ( screaming ) All right! Yes! Great. - Nice. - Whoo! ( laughing ) Man: Yes! Nice. Babe, that was awesome. l can't believe l did it. Who's afraid of heights now, huh? Not my girl. - Wait, l wanna go again. - WiId chiId. Vendor: Listo. Vamos! ( screaming ) Whoo! ( laughing ) ( boat horn blows ) lt's gonna be like old times, Santos. - Yep. - lt's gonna be like old times. She's got a sexy-librarian vibe going. - You ever notice that? - Don't even think it, bro. Oh, what? l'm just gonna talk to her. l've heard that before. Remember Cairo? The lady snake-charmer with cobras? - Cairo, come on. - My left butt cheek went black, Flynn. - AImost feII off. - So you miss me? Excuse me? You might've noticed I took a little hiatus from Blue Water. By hiatus, you mean my father fired you. Yeah. l did notice, Mr. Flynn. Look, call me Andy. ( sighs ) All right. Let's just get this over with so I can get back to work. Give me your best line. Okay. Um, here. - What? - Souvenir from Baghdad-- piece of shrapnel from an IED. Went in back here, played ping-pong with my insides. lf it weren't for Santos over there, l probably wouldn't have made it. So l have him to blame. Look, l remember you too, Nicole, all right? You spent your whole life in that lab. First one there, last one to leave. And l get it. That was me once. AII right? My whole life was work. Thanks to this little guy, it looked like there was no tomorrow. So that's my line. What do you think? Being first in the lab earned me a doctorate from MlT and made me one of the best biomechanical engineers in the country. l care about what l do, Mr. Flynn. As for you, you're a mercenary. Says it all. Hmm. Okay. As smooth as ever, huh? - Oh, shut up. - ( laughs ) ( dance music playing ) Okay, if that didn't get your booty shaking, have somebody check your pulse, 'cause you might be dead. l'm Captain Jack and this is PV Pirate Radio, your spring break destination. Just in case they're listening, l wanted to give a special shout out to the FCC, 'cause those are the boys who kicked my ass out of America. And, boys, you have doomed me to a life filled with sandy beautiful beaches, smoking hot señoritas and ice cold piña coladas. - You sure taught me a lesson. - ( both laugh ) Folks, l may never leave here. God, l hate it here. You're kidding me, right? l mean, this place is amazing. Yeah, whatever. And what is it with all this-- what do you caII it? - Sunshine? - Yes. Sunshine. Enough with the freaking sun already. - It's annoying. - ( phone chimes ) What do you got here? TeII you in a sec. You are live in five. Four, three, two... Hey, party people, it's Captain Jack and you are listening to PV Pirate Radio. First mate Stephie has just handed me some breaking news. Apparently a half shark, haIf octopus has been sighted off the coast two miIes south of Playa Del Sol. According to sources, it is armed and dangerous. Yes, it's half octopus, so it would be eight-armed and dangerous, right? Well, Stephanie apparently is hitting the tequila a little early today and she's not sharing with her captain. - ( cIicks ) - l always share with you. Yeah. So what is this, Stephie? ls this some mad experiment gone horribIy wrong? - Maybe they're doing a movie. - Oh, yeah. l could see that now. A former Navy SEAL slash oceanographer is tracking down this abomination before it takes any more lives. l'd watch it. Yeah, I know you wouId, Stephanie. That's because you're easily amused. l've seen you mesmerized watching a frozen burrito rotate in a microwave oven. Let's get back to the music, shall we? Coming up next, it's the Cheetah Whores, very hot band out of New York City. Here is their latest hit. lt's called "Hot Rod Hell Kitten." Meow. - ( rock music pIaying ) - What are you doing with this stuff? ♪ l'm a hot rod hell kitten, get inside ♪ ♪ I'm a hot rod hell kitten, take a ride ♪ ♪ ltty-bitty pretty kitty ♪ ♪ Let's go out and prowl the city ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be my pet? ♪ ♪ Do you wanna be my pet? ♪ ♪ l'm a cheetah whore, can you run with that? ♪ ♪ Yeah! Yeah! ♪ Well, this is it. - Nice view, huh? - Yeah yeah, breathtaking. - Hey! - There. Thank you. - Hook me up? - Not a chance. Aw, you're no fun. So what makes you think it'II come back here? WeII, when you spend your days gutting fish, you Iearn a thing or two about marine life. - ( spits ) - Hard to believe you're still single. Would've thought some lucky lady would've snapped you up by now. As l was saying, octopi are very territorial. He'll be back. Nicole: Santos, take it 20 miles south and stop by the rocks. Let me see that thing. Easy, bro. Those spears inject enough MS-222 to put a bull shark to sleep. But it can't bring down S-1 1? Nicole: S-1 1's metabolism is higher than a typical shark. Tranqs just make it more... amenable. - Kind of like you and tequila, huh? - ( laughs ) - ( sonar pinging ) - I got a signaI. - lt's two miles south of here. - Yeah, I know the pIace. Resorts all over the area. ( dials cell phone ) ( rings ) - Dad. - Yes, Nicole. - We got a signaI. - l don't have to tell you what's at stake here, pumpkin. l told you to stop calling me that. l'm counting on you, Nicole. Bring S-1 1 home. Okay, Stacy, in three, two... Stacy Everheart here with local fisherman Ryan Kingsberry. lt's Pez. All right, Pez. Can you tell us what you saw? Well, l first saw the creature coming in from out there chasing a charter. l thought it was a shark at first, and then l saw the tentacles and black soulless eyes Iike my third wife's. Cut. What are you doing? Are you high orjust that stupid? Holy crap! ( bellowing ) Hey! Hey! Get out of there! Yoga instructor: lnhale. Get out of there! lnhale. Exhale. Break left. Hola, señorita. You wanna play? Not really. Hey, what's the holdup? Got it! ( grunting ) Mark! ( crunches ) ( roars ) ( people screaming ) - Are you getting this? - Yes. yes. ( screams ) - ( S-1 1 roaring ) - ( screaming ) ( shrieks ) Pez: Get out of there! ( screams ) - Is it over yet? - Um, not quite. ( gasping ) Pez: Oh, this ain't happening. ( panting ) That was horrible. Sure. Sure. Horrible. Come on, let's go. ( sonar pings ) Damn it! Lost the signal. - What? - l lost the signal. S-1 1's gone. Damn it! You sure that thing works? l told you the tracer got damaged when S-1 1 escaped. Great. So we're chasing ghosts out here. l don't think so. We sure our freak did that? The abrasions on his body are tentacle markings. Why didn't it eat him? Maybe he wasn't hungry. Oh, keen insight. l'm so glad you came along. TeII me something, Ms. Sands, what do you know? l know octopi like big rocks. - Sir. - What is it? There's something on TV I think you shouId see. Stacy: My crew and l captured this footage an hour ago around Playa Del Sol... So far only CNE is carrying this. And that's supposed to make me feel any better? Stacy: The creature appeared to be some hybrid of shark and octopus. - A sharktopus, if you will. - Hell. Stacy: As viewers can see, the creature is like nothing ever witnessed before, and neither is its brutality. There's no confirmation by authorities yet, but fatalities are certain. Dr. Sands, you've got an incoming call on satellite link. - Stacy: lt's only a matter of time... - It's Commander Cox. ...before the sharktopus strikes again. - All right, patch him in. - Stacy Everheart reporting. Wait. First bring me a great, big, enormous scotch. - Three and neat, sir? - Yeah. Got it. What's going on? Why did we come ashore? To get away from your dad's EagIe Scouts so you can teII me what the hell you're hiding. - What are you taIking about? - S-1 1's killing at random. Why? I toId you, l have no idea. Look, even I know sharks aren't serial killers, okay? They kill for a purpose. And octopi? ( scoffs ) Smart as hell, and not to mention stealthy. Okay, so they're not gonna expose themseIves unless they got a damn good reason not to. Maybe our neural implants are damaging the impulse controls in S-1 1's brain. Or maybe your father did something to that freak, something you don't know about. You know, a little gene splicing behind closed doors? No, he wouldn't do that, not without consulting me first. My father is a man of science. How about you teII that to the dead guy out there? What's that supposed to mean? lt means that l think your dad intended S-1 1 to succeed at all costs. Blue Water didn't hire you to think. They hired you to do a job. And if you can't do it, we'll find someone who can. ( sighs ) Get Tom on the phone. Look, l don't care if he's in a meeting. Tell him Stacy Everheart wants to taIk to him now. - Thank you. - ( TV playing ) Yep, l'm watching the recap right now. So what'd the network say? Tom: The network is replacing you, Stacy. - What? - l'm sorry. - That's the decision they've made. - But it's my story. - Hey, Stacy-- - l hope you understand, all right? No, l understand. - Fine. - ( beeps ) Rat bastards are sending in another reporter to take the lead. - What? - What is this? Pez figured out a pattern in the attacks. Show me. This is where l first spotted the creature. This was the attack on the bungee tower. And this was the attack on the resort. So it's sticking to the coast heading south. - Yeah. - What are we supposed to do? Just head south and hope we run into it? Worth a shot, and maybe we can get some more footage. Then the network would have to make us the Ieads. You know, l bet we could cover a lot more miles by boat. Fine. But you're gonna double my salary and you're gonna pay for my car. Oh, Pez, l could just hug you right now. l mean, if you were better looking and had better hygiene. Oh, what the hell! - Pez! - l'm sorry. Lock and load, boys. It's time to get wet. You got the helm, brother. You better watch your back down there. Oh, watching my back is yourjob. - l don't know. Am l in your will? - You get my dog. You don't have a dog. ( laughs ) Hey. Remember, my dad doesn't want S-1 1 harmed, aII right? And we always do what Daddy says, don't we? ReIax, l've got 300,000 reasons to bring that thing back in one piece. We stick to the plan, tranq it, force it to the surface, then Santos shoots it with your remote control gizmo, and you guys jockey it back to your yacht, if your gear really works. Yeah, it does work. So make sure you don't miss. l haven't yet. Now l'm ready. Patch him in. Guess what l just saw on CNE. S-1 1 looks impressive on TV, doesn't it, Commander? Are you drinking? Yes, l am. Scotch. - Good scotch. - Damn it, Sands. You said you could handle this. - Listen, if you can't handIe-- - No, Commander, you listen. The Navy said they wanted a killing machine. That's exactly what l gave them. And yes, the civilian deaths are a tragedy. But greatness comes at a price. It aIways has. Just capture that freak before it shows up on TV again. lf the media links this to the Navy, we're screwed. Don't worry, Commander. l've got my best man on it. Don't worry. Flynn can take care of himself. Worried? Why would l be worried? - No reason. - Hey, do me a favor. Stay out of my business and focus on the shooting. - AII right? - Yes, ma'am. ( growling ) What is that? - lnk. - Oh God, no. ( bellows ) - ( thuds ) - ( gurgling ) Santos. lt's right behind me. lt got me in the leg. Did your tranq hit it? No. lt pulled it out of its hide. - What about the others? - They're gone. They're dead. So what makes you think we'll spot it out here? l don't know, but if you've got a better idea, l'm all ears. No no, you're the captain. Nice yacht, by the way. Bite me. ( groans ) Flynn: What do you think? Two or three stitches? Santos: This is nothing. Remember that go-go dancer in Bangkok? Crazy chica nearly bit your pinkie toe off. Now that was bad. Man, l have no idea where that thing came from. - lt's like it knew we were coming. - That's what sharks do, amigo. No, this wasn't predatory instinct. This was a pIanned attack. - ls that mine? - Damn it. You better not have any diseases. Yeah, well, it burns when l urinate. - Shouldn't be concerned, should l? - ( cell phone rings ) - Oh, there's Daddy. - Dad. Yeah, it escaped and the tracer went dead again. ls that your dad? Tell him l miss him. ls that Flynn? Yeah, he's still in shock from the bIood Ioss. - Can he continue the mission? - He'll be fine. But the others, they weren't so lucky. They knew the risks, Nicole. Dad, S-1 1 is a kiIIer, and they're random. lt's not even feeding on its victims. Dad? I had the tech boys make some adjustments to S-1 1's subroutines. You altered my programming? S-1 1 was a hunter. We needed a killer. So we enhanced its aggressiveness. l designed the bioware. l should've been consulted. This isn't right. lt's time for you to grow up, baby girl. Our feelings are irrelevant. Right now all that matters is getting S-1 1 back. Am I cIear? Are you with me? - Yes. - Good. Now bring S-1 1 home, baby girl. Did he ask about me? - Can you move on that thing? - Why? Wanna go dancing later? Do you always make asinine jokes when men have died? Look, what do you want from me? l want you to do your damn job and capture S-1 1 . Okay. You heard the woman, fire it up. - Where are we headed? - South. ( motor revving ) NicoIe: He's headed straight for that boat. Flynn: l'm pulling up behind them to get their attention. We gotta get them out of here. Hey! - Leave! - Hey, this is a restricted area! Can you hear them? l can't hear what they're saying. This is restricted area. Bones, get on the clock. Something's going on. Please go! They're not listening. They'll listen to this. - ( gunfire ) - ( gasps ) Keep filming. - What are you doing? - l didn't sign up to get shot. That's my story you're running away from. l'm getting the hell out of here. Hey! You crazy bitch! ( screams ) Oh my God! ( panting ) Your dad's gonna have to settle for damaged goods. ( screaming ) ( S-1 1 roars ) It's heading away from the rocks. l'm gonna run that bastard down. Santos, take the helm. - l'm gonna take a shot at it. - Got it. - Santos. - l'm on it. ( fires ) Damn! How about that one? All right, man. Perfect. To the boat and back. Loser gets the tequila. Let's do it. What are these morons doing? Hey, you're a little close, huh? - ( whistIes, Iaughs ) - What are you doing? What is this, an amusement park to you? - Hey! - l'm trying to fish here. - ( laughing ) - Hey! Hey, Maria. l can't believe this. What's going on, honey? Bunch of stupid punks. ( engine sputtering ) ( screaming ) ( clamoring ) Dios mío. Tequila's on you guys, and I'm super thirsty. Where's Bob? l don't know. He was just right behind you. Hey, something just touched my leg. What was that? ( screaming ) Ed. Ed! Ed! Ed! ( screams ) ( crunching ) l've been horrible to you this whole time. And you don't deserve it. l'm sorry, Flynn. lt's Andy. Andy, there's something I need to teII you. ( man speaking Spanish ) Got it. Gracias, Miguel. What? Nothing. What'd you find out? The powerboat was rented by some Blue Water Corporation, some shady genetics engineering firm, knee-deep in defense department contracts, enough cash to go all Frankenstein and create our fish. That's great. What is wrong with you? Were you a lawyer in a past life? Or no, maybe you worked at the DMV. Do you feel nothing, Stacy? That guy was killed right in front of us inches away. lnches away! Gosh. He was kind of a nice guy, you know? Smell a little funky, but he was okay. Now he's dead. And that's tragic truly. But the story of a lifetime is right out that door. And we can find it thanks to Pez's map. - No no. - Oh, come on, Bones. He would've wanted it this way. Don't let his death mean nothing. You are so full of crap. I know, but you're coming with me anyway. Hell not! Your father did what? Altered S-1 1's neural implants, disrupting serotonin levels. Making it more aggressive. That explains all the random attacks. You know what I gave up to be my dad's perfect little scientist? Now he goes and does this behind my back. Look, l'm sorry, Nicole. What can I say? He's my dad. l love him. - ( sonar pinging ) - Santos: FIynn. It's the tracking device on my computer. S-1 1's near. Do you mind telling us the plan? We've been one step behind that freak all day. Time to cut it off. ( rock music playing ) ( cell phone beeps ) You aren't gonna believe this. What? You're finaIIy ready to admit you're attracted to me? Thank God. The sexual tension was unbearable. Ew! Gross. God. - You? - All right, easy. A simple no would've sufficed. The captain has feelings, you know? All right, Jack, there has been another sighting of this creature. And now supposedly CNE is running footage of it. Really? Wow. - How gullible do you think l am? - Look, this isn't a joke, I swear. Just, please, warn the audience. - Okay, l'll warn them. - ( music turns off ) Attention all hands. This is your captain speaking. We're getting more reports about this half shark, half octopus creature that's terrorizing the coast, but please do not panic. There is a way we can stop this thing. Virgin sacrifices. Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin, preferably 18 to 25 years old. I repeat-- sharktopus wants our virgins. So all prospective candidates, please email your photos, preferabIy nudes, l wish there was another way. l'm sorry. This is our onIy hope. Damn you, sharktopus! ( laughs ) ( music turns on ) Oh, what? Don't look at me like that. Oh! How can you live with yourself? - You're not punking me on this thing? - No. Stephie, this has to be a hoax, okay? It's gotta be. There's no way a shark-octopus fishy thingy really exists. - Well, l hope you're right. - Trust me, okay? There is no such thing as a sharktopus. ( screaming ) - ( thuds ) - Gotta love these Mexican roads. Where are we? Please, just keep your eyes on the road. Shame on you if you kill us before sharktopus does. Honey, why don't we go back to the resort? Not until l hook a fish. You still worried about that shark we saw? lt wasn't a shark. Look, babe, relax. lt's a big ocean. No matter what it was, we're not gonna see it again. ( water splashes ) ( whistles ) What are we doing here? - We're two miles off the last signal. - Check your map. You'll notice the distance between S-1 1's attacks are nearIy equaI. How did you figure this out? Back at Los Arcos l wasn't sure. And now you are? Nope, but l'm sick and tired of chasing the freak around aII day. So if l'm right, it'll come to us. You're in no condition for diving. Wasn't planning on it. We can lure S-1 1 to the surface without using the tranqs. And how do we do that? - Ugh! - What? You've never seen five gallons of fish guts before? - ( reel clicking ) - Whoa! Come here. Good! Did you get a fish? Come on. ( grunting ) Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. ( laughs ) Got you. l can't believe you bought that. - Estúpido. - Oh, estúpido? How about now? - How about now, honey? - No. No. How about now, honey? Huh? Huh? How about now? ( screaming ) Kevin! Kevin, where are you? Kevin! Kevin! Kevin, where are you? Kevin! Oh my God. - Kevin! - ( S-1 1 growls ) ( screaming ) Flynn. Over there. Get us over there. No, the chum's working. S-1 1's coming to us. ( pinging ) Nicole: S-1 1 has gone off the grid. The software is gIitching. Damn, lost the signal. ( screaming ) - No. - Santos! Nicole: Santos! - Santos! - Help me! - Flynn: l got you, buddy. - Santos, hold on. Don't let go. - ( S-1 1 growIs ) - Santos: Flynn! Nicole: Hold on! Santos: Flynn! Shoot it, Flynn! - Damn you, you freak. - Shoot it with a dart. - Shoot it with a dart. - l can't, it's jammed. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't let go. Don't Iet go. - Don't Iet-- - ( groaning ) - No! - Santos! - ( Santos screams ) - FIynn: No! ( crunching ) Santos! ( screams ) No! Andy. lt knew we were setting up an ambush. lt knew. What are you doing? What l should've done from the beginning. ( motor starts ) Take the wheel. Get that. - ( shouting ) - Right. Where is it? I don't know. lt was right in front of us. Check the trace. Whoa! You okay? Yeah. Andy, look. lt's heading for the resort. Great. ( motor sputters ) lt must've damaged the propellers. No no, damn it! ( cell phone rings ) Nicole, what's happening? S-1 1 just killed Santos. lt's moving ashore. - Has it been harmed? - What? Has S-1 1 been harmed? Listen to me, you arrogant bastard. Santos was my best friend, all right? Emotion is blinding, Mr. Flynn. This is bigger than Santos. lt's bigger than you. Yeah, I'II think about that when l'm drowning your freak in bullets. I have $1 miIIion that says you won't do that. One million to bring S-1 1 back to me. What do you say? What do you say? - Keep your money. - ( hangs up ) Sir, we've got Commander Cox on the sateIIite Iink again. Uh... patch him in. What's the news, Sands? Did you catch our fish yet? lt's my fish. - And we're closing in on it. - Not good enough. You need to bag that thing now. If you can't do it, l'll send a team in to terminate it. - Shut up. - lt can be there in an hour, turn that freak of yours into chowder and Ieave no sign it ever existed. Shut up! - Sands. Sands! - Cut him off. Cut him off! - What's going on? - Son of a bitch. - Find a place to dock this thing. - Sir? Move. Contact Briggs. Tell him to get a car ready. Go! ( motor sputtering ) Flynn: The engine's toast. That's all she's got left. Come on. Come on, baby. You can make it. Andy, wait. Talk to me. l am done talking. ( crowd cheering ) - ( dance music pIaying ) - Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the Puerto Vallarta Dancers. Tell me we can find them. Yes sir. We're tracking the GPS in your daughter's computer. Honestly, Mr. Sands, l don't think that's gonna be enough to stop S-1 1 . lt's not for S-1 1 . Which way? - Woman: Oh my God. - That's great. ( S-1 1 growls ) - ls that part of the show? - I don't know. - Cool, Dad. Look. - Oh my God! ( screaming ) ( roars ) ( screaming ) ( bones cracking ) ( grunting ) - Oh man! - ( screaming ) That way. ( screaming ) Dude, that's awesome. - ( screaming ) - Move. Move! ( screaming ) - Eat this, you bastard. - ( gunfire ) ( S-1 1 howls ) ( grunts ) You can't hide. l'll find you. - Damn it. - Where does this channel lead? Where are you going? l might be able to head it off before it reaches the river. Okay, if S-1 1 wants upriver it has to pass by here. Check the trace. ( typing ) Come on, come on. There's no signal. Damn it. What about them? Excuse me. Excuse me, everyone. There's a killer shark-octopus hybrid headed this way. So please leave the marina in a timely fashion. - What are you talking about? No. - No? - Okay, how about this? - ( gunfire ) ( screaming ) - You enjoyed that way too much. - It worked, didn't it? Mr. Flynn! Tell me, Mr. Flynn, when did you become such a people person? Dad, what are you doing? Last chance for you to reconsider my offer. Or what? Your boys gonna shoot me down? What's your life compared to a miracle of science? - Dad, don't do this. - Baby girl, my SUV's in the parking lot. Go wait for me there. No. l'm not your little girl anymore. Andy's right. S-1 1 needs to be put down. - You don't know what you're saying. - S-1 1's a crime against nature. - We went too far. - lt can be controlled, baby. You know that. At what price? How many more lives are you gonna sacrifice? What about my life? Oh, baby. S-1 1 is my creation. Mine. l dedicated my entire life to it. l will not allow anyone to destroy it. Not even you. ( sonar pinging ) - What? - Dad, it's here. - Come on! - ( S-1 1 bellows ) ( screaming ) No. No! - ( Sands grunts ) - Dad! NicoIe: Oh my God! No! ( growls ) ( screaming ) No, Dad! Help me! - No! Dad! - NicoIe! No no! - Nicole, no. - HeIp me! - Dad, be careful. No! - ( gunshots ) Dad! ( whimpers ) ( groans ) Nicole: No! Dad! ( moans ) - ( gagging ) Nicole. - Dad! - Nicole. Nicole. - Dad. - Kill-- kill swi-- kill swi-- - What? - Dad. - You can still-- What? l love you, pumpkin. No. ( crying ) ( kisses ) l'm sorry, Nicole. l've gotta go after it. Someone will come for you. Andy, wait. - This is the place. - You said that the last three stops. This map is useIess. We should call it quits for today. We call it quits when l say we call it quits. Hey, it's the guy from the speedboat. The one following the sharktopus. Come on. The river narrows a few miIes south, so we just need to get a pair of wheels. All right. I'm Stacy Everheart with CNE. Can you tell me what you're doing here? Get out of my face, lady. What connection do you have to the creature known as the sharktopus? Are you empIoyed by the Blue Water Corporation? You got a car? - Yeah. - Gimme the keys. You're going after that thing, aren't you? Take me with you, and you can use my van. - No. - Then have fun walking. ( thudding ) Gotta love Mexican roads, huh? What are you planning? The river bottlenecks upstream. l'll cut it off there. - What about my story? - No names, no interviews. Then what the hell do l get? Exclusive footage of sharktopus getting shot to hell. Man: Hey! Yeah! Whoo! Hey, guys. Can l get you anything? Are you finished? ( roaring ) Jack, be careful. Not too close to the edge. Whoo-hoo! ( roaring ) Mom! Mom! Help me! Help me! HeIp me, pIease! Somebody please help me. Woman: Jack! Jack! - Jack! Oh my God! - ( cIamoring ) ( screaming ) No! Jack! Oh my God. Jack! ( people screaming ) ( screaming ) Looks like we're late to the party. Great, l've got no bullets left and we're out of grenades. - You couId use this. - Nicole, we're past that. Wait. Hear me out. S-1 1 has a kill switch-- explosives laced into its neural implants. But the switch became inoperable when S-1 1's bioware was damaged. Then what good is it? My dad-- l think he was trying to tell me something. l think l can access the kill switch with my computer. - Bones. Bones. - What? l think it's over there. Come on, Iet's go. But only if we establish a link with the interface dart. We're gonna blow up S-1 1's brains, but we can only establish a link if we get cIose enough to the interface dart and S-1 1 . ( sighs ) Okay. So in other words, what you're trying to say is that l've gotta tag that mother with an interface dart and you've gotta be cIose enough to bIow it to heII? Yeah, that's the plan. Better than no plan. Please help me find my son. He's missing! CaIm down. What's his name? Mom! - l got him. Stay here. - He'll be fine. Just calm down, okay? ( whimpering ) PIease. l cannot believe that you didn't get that shot. l am sick of your attitude. You know what? l'm tired about you. l'm tired about the work. Just go on your way and l'm going on my way. - Fine. - Boy: Mom! ( crying ) Jack. Jack, come here. Come to me, buddy. lt's okay. Come on. Trust me, it's okay. Jack, come on. Come to me. lt's all right. Give me your hand. There you go. There you go. Yeah, let's go, buddy. I got you. Yeah. Yeah, come here. I got you. l got you. Let's go. ( crying ) Jack! Here. lt's the last one so you better not miss. I've been missing aII day and l'm getting tired of it. Now go over there. It'II be safer. No, l'm staying with you. NicoIe, go over there and get your mojo ready. l'm gonna draw it to you. Go! Bones! Bones, where the hell are you? God. Oh my God. ( S-1 1 growls ) Oh God. Oh God. Oh my God! ( screaming ) ( gurgling ) ( S-1 1 roars ) Got you, you mother. ( beeps ) Whoa! Nicole! ( grunts ) Nicole, hurry! Nicole! I got it. Anytime now, Nicole. Oh, Dad, what did you do? I hope you choke on me, you freak. Come on! ( grunting ) Oh my God. ( Flynn screaming ) Hold on. ( Flynn screaming ) Oh, Dad. Nicole! Okay, l got it. ( growling ) ( Flynn screaming ) Oh my God. ( panting ) Nicole: lmpressive. You need help? l'll live. That thing better not jump out at us again. No, that only happens in the movies. ( laughs ) Yeah. ( orchestral music playing )
