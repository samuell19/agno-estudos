[waves rushing] [melancholy music] [seagulls cawing] Oh, this is nice. [sighing] This is nice. Acres and acres, Kate. Acres and acres, my darlin'. -What are you doing? -Kissing you. -You just did. -Yeah. -And then you kissed me again. -Well spotted. -Did you kiss me again? -Yeah. -No, you didn't. -Yes, I did. -No, you didn't. -Yes, I did. -I kissed you twice, I promise. -No, you didn't. -No, you didn't. -Come here. [rain splattering] [melancholy music] Daddy? Come up here, come sit with me. There you go, that's it. My other beautiful little boy, come on. Boys, remember yesterday, when you both gave your mommy a massive cuddle in bed? And she was so poorly, wasn't she? You know, she couldn't fight anymore. [Finn] Has mommy gone to heaven? Yes, darling, yeah. So, she's in a cloud? Um, yeah, you can imagine her sitting on a cloud, if you like. What are we gonna do now? Um, well, we'll just go on, mate. Has all mom's stuff gone? Oh, no, no. Of course not, no, not a bit of it. Mommy just blew us a kiss. [seagulls cawing] [Kate] Look at those trails. It's like they've blown a kiss. How is it like a kiss? Well, because [smooching and blowing]. [laughs] I like that. Me, too. It's all sunny now, look. Got everything? [Reef] What's all that? What? Oh, yeah. Let's have a look. It's from John and Leslie, in number 12. That's nice, isn't it? There's a card. -But what are they? -It's food parcels. -I'm not hungry. -No, I'm not hungry either, but when-- when we are all the hard work's been done, hasn't it? It's nice of people. -Do you want to go inside? -Yeah. [melancholy music] Get those coats off. Don't forget them things, don't forget them. Let's see it. So what we'll do, if you, uh go and get changed, yeah and-- and then we can watch a bit of telly. And then we'll have a bit of dinner and... Reef said she's never coming back. You know I want to see her again. I do, desperately. But it doesn't mean she's not here, come here, come here. It doesn't mean she's not here, it's okay. You know, she's still here. In your mind, eh? And in your memories and in your heart. -Tired, lads? -Yeah. Yeah, you okay? -Do me a favor? -Yeah. Will you, um, go upstairs and run you both a bath? -Sure. -Yeah, take your brother up with you. Fold these jumpers up and you can wear them tomorrow 'cause they're not dirty. And then just make sure you put your trousers in the washing basket, okay? [sighing heavily] [Kate] Singe, it's probably nothing, but I think I found a lump. [Singe] Where? Here. I think, I don't know. It's probably nothing, but will you see if you can-- -[Singe] Shall I have a feel? -Yeah. Get your shirt off, girl. -Where, show me? -There. -Oh, there. -Yeah? -That thing there? -Yeah. -Yeah, is it tender? -A bit. It feels a bit hard, you can feel something. -Like I said, but it's probably nothing. -Yeah. -I'll get it checked. -Should maybe get it checked just to be on the safe side, eh. -I'm sure it'll be fine. -Yeah. -Actually, I could call now. -Give them a call now. -What time is it? Yeah, they should still be open. -I might call now. Okay. [pressing dials] Yeah, hi, it's Kate Greene. I wondered if I could make an appointment? [Dr. Adams] Kate, we found two cancers, both in the same breast, and both grade three. Now, it looks as though some of the lymph glands are involved which makes it Stage two, but that's what we term common. [nurse] That's actually a really good sign, Kate. Because there's an 80% chance of survival for the first 10 years. And those chances improve all the time after that, year on year. [Dr. Adams] Given the diagnosis, that prognosis is about the best that we could wish for. Nonetheless, we want to get on top of it. We want to chase it out. So we're looking at a mastectomy and possible reconstruction if that's what you want. [nurse] We'd like to book you in for that next week. [Dr. Adams] It's likely that we'll need to give you chemotherapy treatment, but we'll discuss that after surgery. [nurse] Does all this make sense so far, Kate? Not the worst news I've ever heard, believe it or not. Our little boy had cancer, you see. Um... -He's just recovered-- He's recovered now. -[Dr. Adams] Great. -And he was given, uh, he was given a 6% chance of survival. -Wow. [Singe] And now we just celebrated his fifth birthday. -[chuckling] -[Kate] In style. [Dr. Adams] Good for him! That's good for all of you. Didn't think this was how I'd end up with bigger boobs. [both chuckling] [somber tense music] -What time is it? -I haven't got my watch and my phone's dead, I don't know. Reef, you've got to take your medicine. So, Mommy might be taking medicine like this soon. [Reef] Why? Because I had a lump found just like you had a lump. Cancer? Yeah, cancer. But my lump's been taken away just like Reef's was. And now I'm gonna have the same medicines. They're disgusting. I know, but they made you better just like they're gonna make me better. I'll look after you, Mommy. -Sweetie, I know you will. -Me, too. I know, sweetie, you both will, my beautiful little men. Daddy? What are you doing? It smells like Mommy. [melancholy music] [laughing and chattering] -[Singe] Alright then. -Wait, okay, we're each gonna find one, a four leaf clover. So spread out and look close. See, I've got these friends, the field fairies and soon enough they'll see me and they'll go, hey, it's Kate, -let's send her a four leaf clover like we always do. -Fields don't have fairies. -Then how come I keep finding four leaf clovers? -[Singe] Does a three count? -Daddy's been asking me that for the last 20 years. -I happen to have a knack for -finding threes, it's not my fault. That's not a knack, that's just lazy, but you're welcome to keep them if you want. -I might just do that. -I only want fours. Yeah, well, I might end up with a bigger collection than you. -No doubt. -How would that make you feel? -I feel absolutely nothing. -Yeah, I know that, jealous. -They have no value whatsoever. -My God, you are such a clover snob! -[Kate giggling] -Aren't you? Hey, look. Boys, help me! -[phone ringing] -Here, here. Thanks, Christine and thanks for coming over. Oh, yeah. Have a look. That's my girl. Reef's medicine, bless her. Alright, okay, um... Okay, Reef, it's time for your medicine. [indistinct] So most people at school will know about what happened, I mean, some might not. And some might wanna talk to you about it. But, you know, some people might not, again, but, uh, it's just very important that you know that everyone loves you and they care about you. -Okay, and they're all your friends, alright? -[Reef] Okay. -Alright, okay? -Okay. Good boys, love you. [melancholy music] [mumbling] Okay. Come on, we'll go to the office, have a little chat. Right. Let's get this over and done with. [Dr. Adams] So, the results show a triple negative which means you're not responsive to the more common hormone treatments. Which means we do need to move you to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But, given the size of the tumor, the fact that the cancer has only crept into one node, and the others have been removed, that's extremely hopeful. I'm gonna handle it just like we've handled it. I'm gonna beat it just like he did. [door creaking] ¶ That's the look That's the look ¶ ¶ The look of love ¶ ¶ That's the look That's the look ¶ ¶ The look of love ¶ -Hi! -Hi! You alright? Yeah, you? I'm good. Uh, my friend's hurt her wrist. Alright, first things first. -What's your name? -Kate. -Kate. Friend's name? -Rachel. -Rachel. -I'm Singe. -What? -Singe. -That's your name? -Yeah, like Sinjun, Saint John. -Saint? -Yeah, where'd you think I came up with Singe? Are you Rachel? You've gotta take it easy. Can't put any weight on it. Don't push off on it or anything like that, alright? -Okay, thanks. -No probs. -Thanks, Singe. -No problem. See you later, alright? [disco music] [Singe] Hey, are you following me? -[Kate] Depends. -On what? -Are you working next weekend? -I work every weekend. -It's my birthday on Friday. -Yeah? You could wish me a happy birthday. Happy birthday! I mean on Friday. -What? -On Friday! -Yeah, alright. -Maybe even a birthday kiss? [Singe laughs] -Do we have a problem? -Nope. So, do we have a deal? Deal. What's this? Your lucky day. ¶ Love, sweet love ¶ ¶ I won't Let another day pass by ¶ ¶ That would be Too big a sacrifice ¶ [tender piano music] -No! -You were doing it a minute ago, just be sexy. -I can't just be sexy! -Pretend Rachel's not here. -Oh, thank you very much! You take 'em. -Really? I'm not gonna get much out of her, am I? I will, alright, come on, Kate, sexy. -No, wait, hold on. -What? -This is not gonna help. -Accessories! [laughs] Ten years later. Okay, now try mysterious. Okay, mysterious. [laughs] -Attitude! -Attitude, try that. -Oh, I can do that. -Alright. [Rachel] Oh, look. Yeah. Is this working for you? [camera clicking] [Singe] Yeah. I'll get back at work, shall I? [laughs] [Kate] A poem is hard to write. The words never come out right. And once the rhyme is found, no words with that sound spring to your mind to express what you find in love. [tender piano music] You wanted me to find this, didn't you? -Ouw! -Careful of your mom, please. -[Kate groaning] -Careful of your mom, please! -Hang on, let me just get up. -Jump on, just be very careful around that area. -Move to the side. -Thank you, oh! -It's not wake up time yet. -It's not, what are you doing? -That's the best -morning wake up ever. -No raspberries in my face. Everything's okay with your blood so we're just gonna get your chemo set up now. This is gonna feel a little odd. Um, you will have some odd sensations, uh, hot flashes, things like that. It's nothing to worry about at all. It's perfectly normal, but please, -let us know if there's anything you're not sure of. -Okay. [Singe] Can I ask you a crass question, how long does that take? [Hannah] So this, it'll take about five hours, so... Yeah. -[Singe] Five hours, by the arm. -I hope you've got a soft cushion. [laughs] -[Singe] I'll find her a soft cushion. -[nurse laughing] Okay. Let's get that running. [Singe] You feeling anything yet? Not yet. -Have we got food for tonight? -Yeah, I've got dinner, let's do fish fingers and that. -Great. -With some pasta or whatever. You hungry now? -You want something now, Monster Munch? -Yeah. -Oh, it feels weird. -Hula Hoops? -Feels weird now? -Yeah. [sighing] -Will you hold my hand? -Yeah, of course, yeah. Can you get Hannah? Sorry, Hannah, Hannah, excuse me? Thank you. She's got-- -Everything okay? -Feels like I need the loo. Okay, it's perfectly normal, just, um, a reaction to the chemotherapy. You're not actually gonna have an accident, okay. -It's fine, it's just-- -You sure? Yeah, honestly, it will start to settle down as it all gets into your body. -But try and relax, okay? -Alright, yeah, thanks. Alright, okay. [melancholy piano music] [Kate] We're gonna be late if we don't hurry. [Singe] I know, we need to get a move on. -You want jam on it? -Uh, no. That is a great photo! That is a brilliant one. One more, one more. [laughs] Those five... -Are you not gonna eat something? -My beautiful boys. Yeah, I will. She had bank statements, wills, the insurance policies, all of them were all laid out, you know. Like, who to call when, which policies to cash in and that sort of thing, incredible. Let's face it, Singe, she always was one step ahead of you. Yeah, you can say that again. But the thing is though, Rach, you know, like doing all that stuff and-- and getting it all sorted, but knowing why you were getting it sorted, you know? Do you know what I mean? -But-- but still doing it, still carrying on regardless. -She made it her job. -Yeah. -That's Kate all over. I know. Oh, yeah, that's what I wanted to-- I found these the other day um, when I was up in the attic having a root around. -Have a look. -Oh, my god. -Oh, my god! I remember that, yeah! -Do you remember these, yeah? You were as good as shagging that day. Oh, stop it. Lovely. -[Rachel] She was so beautiful. -I know. Like this is all the, like memories and stuff. You know like this is the only version I've got of her in it. Do you know what I mean? Like, I'm not gonna make any new memories. [Rachel] On the morning she died... [Singe] BPITW, what's that mean? -Best pal in the world. -[Singe laughs] -Sending me texts on her last day. -Katie. -So I'd feel better. -I know. I got loads, I got loads of ones like that. I'll show-- I'll show you my favorite one, actually. This wasn't on her last day, she'd died but it was, um... -[Rachel] Singe's pepper sauce? -Yeah, she loved my pepper sauce. She just wanted me to remember that, you know. Um... 'Cause I to-- You know I told her how frightened I was, you know, do you know what I mean, about like... about being on my own with two little boys and stuff. What was I gonna do without her? Um, and so what she'd do, she'd send me like messages like that. She'd send me loads of them. She'd write things down on Post-it Notes and, um, uh, little scraps of paper and stuff. Like a-- like a written, um, version of her. You know what I should do, Rach, is, um, I should get them all together, shouldn't I? Like, all the-- all the texts and the messages and I should put them all in one-- all in one thing, shouldn't I? That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

Well, you haven't looked properly because it's literally right there. There's your stripey one, put it on, please. [melancholy piano music] -[Reef] Was I in Mommy's tummy at this time? -Where? Oh, no, bloody hell, mate, no, we were young there. I mean, I was like, 20 years old. That was before I was even, you were even a twinkle in my eye. Thank you, get in. I could not doubt that this was the black spot. And taking it up I found written on the other side in a very good, clear hand this short message. "You have till ten tonight." I love you.

No, no, it's fine, I'll do it. -What I'll do is, I'll cut it like-- Singe, just do it! -No, I'll cut it so far-- -Please. -And then you shave the rest of it, okay? -Okay. -Alright, you ready? -Yeah. Oh, bloody hell. [grunting] Ah! -Okay? -Yeah. Just put that there. [laughs] And the rest. Okay, that's not a bad little cut. -[Kate] Are you ready? -Yes. Yeah, we're ready.

[laughs] Oh, Singe! -No, I mean it. -You look like a boy. -True. -Yeah, a sexy boy. -Come here. -A boy I'd like to meet. -[laughs] -Honestly, you look beautiful. -Well, we'll get used to it. -I'll get used to it. But how will we know who you are? I'm still the same, I'm still your mom. We could always draw it on with a yellow pen if it helps. Couldn't we? -That's not attractive. -Not a bad idea.

And they're all around us and we're sitting there proudly thinking, we started this.

It's like I'm pregnant all over again. Wait till you feel sick to eat. But, you know, it makes me strong. Helps so much it's Mexican. I know I might not get through this. God, Kate, am I gonna need tissues? No, I'm just saying, I'm gonna fight. I'm never not gonna do that. But I also want to prepare. I owe it to the boys and to Singe. I just wish I could tell Singe to prepare as well. Good luck with that. He'll keep running if it means he doesn't have to look back. You'll be there for him, though? Him and the boys. Of course, I would. But you're gonna get well. End of. And you said I wouldn't need tissues. [laughs] Hello. [Kate] Hiya. -Okay? -Yeah, good.

I ain't done nothing. It'll look much better when all the fish and everything's going in there. [water splashing] [tender piano music] So, I'm gonna go for a run, okay? I can pass by the shop, see if you need anything. -I'll be fine. -No? Okay, um, so, um... Yeah, I'll... I'll go and get changed. Okay, bro? He had a 6% chance of survival, mate. He had 60 doses of general anesthetic. 30 rounds of radiotherapy. 40 of chemo. I used to have to go into his room and untie him every night because he, when he tossed and turned he got all the tubes wrap-- wrapped around himself. And I signed off on every single fucking one of them just because, you know, because I had to, just so he could be here now, standing here, growing up. He had eight tubes in his body, man, eight tubes. You imagine that? His mouth was riddled with ulcers. He was in bed 24/7, observation on the hour, through the night, every single hour. When he, um, when he had the chemo his nappies were radioactive. We used to have to... We used to have to wear disposable rubber gloves to change him. The chemo made his, um, urine toxic, you know, so, it burnt our hands, when we'd change him. There's other people worrying about wh-- wh-- what organic food to give their kids or what will happen to their kid if they give it another fucking scoop of ice cream and then where we are, you know. Pumping as many deadly chemicals into his tiny little body as he could take. Because killing that thing, that had to come first, Matt! It had to come first, it had to come second, it had to come third, it had to come fourth! And the amount of times that me and Kate that we'd sit there and we would wish it was us and not him, not our little boy, and now it is Kate! It is, it's fucking Kate! [Singe heaving] You said it, Singe. All the shit you put him through and he's still here. 'Cause that's what this does, it keeps 'em here. Yeah, I know, mate. [sighing] Bloody hell, pull yourself together, Singe, this is ridiculous. [sniffling] Coming in here crying like a baby. -In front of my fucking little brother, it's ridiculous. -Anytime. I know, but don't tell anyone about this, alright? You know, I know, I know you. -[Matt chuckles] -Ridiculous, geez Louise. Alright, mate, I'll see you later, yeah? I'll give you a call. Yeah, yeah, call me later. [Singe] What the hell am I doing going to a nightclub of all places? [Rachel] It's a family birthday, Singe. Yeah, but a family birthday in a night club? [Rachel] Relax, it's an evening out, -just enjoy it. -Well, I'll try. -You better, that's part of the deal. -I'll give it a go. Alright, then, give us a call if there's any problems, okay? -There won't be, it's fine. -Alright, babe, see you. Bye! There is the happy couple! Hello, darling, happy birthday! -Thank you for making it! -I wouldn't miss it for the world. -How are you? -I'm good. -Hello, Matthew. -Good to see you. -Glad you came out. -Thanks. -I'll get drinks. -Thank you. -Looking very pretty on your birthday. -Thank you! I think you've got some folks coming out tonight. -We've a good turnout so far. -Nice venue, well done. -Yeah, how you doing? -Singe! Yes, mate, I'll have a Bacardi Breezer, please. No, I'll have a pint of lager, what are you talking about? What do you fancy, Kate? Well, it's good to see ya. Glad you came over, man. Um, sorry, man. Why don't you get a drink in there and we'll-- I'm just gonna go and take a second outside. -Singe, bro, bro! -I won't be long. ¶ Your reason for leaving ¶ ¶ Don't ask me what it means ¶ ["Don't You Forget About Me" by James Morrison] ¶ Won't you come see about me ¶ ¶ I'll be alone ¶ ¶ Dancing, you know it, baby ¶ ¶ Tell me your troubles And doubts ¶ -¶ Giving me everything ¶ -I've got that feeling again. -¶ Inside and out and ¶ -What feeling's that?

So your last words were sorry. I didn't know what you meant by that. I used to think that it was because... because you didn't think it would end this way. But I think you said it because you knew I didn't think it would. [Dr. Adams] You're through the worst of it, Kate. The discomfort's gonna be acute, though. So, painkillers, antibiotics is the order of the day. Obviously, it's gonna be a number of years before we can say that you're through the cancer completely, but it's a great start. We've drawn a line in the sand. We've got a horizon to aim for. -[seagulls cawing] -[peaceful music] Oh, this is nice. This is nice! [waves crashing] Can you believe it? Us, now, here, this? A bit rad. It feels like we've turned a corner, Singe. It really feels like it. Like fresh air. Acres and acres, Kate. Acres and acres, my darlin'. -[laughs] I won! -Is that a moon? -Yeah, it's a half moon. What do you mean, is that a moon? That's my best moon! -Daddy got it in three. -Yeah, I'm gonna have to... You could have done a curve! -Alright, who's up next? -Me! -Me again! -Okay. -Do you wanna take it off? -Ow! -Take it off her. Goodnight, my sweetheart. Acres and acres. Acres and acres, Mom. Goodnight, Reefie. You can sleep here if you want. -I always used to get tired after the treatment. -Yeah? -Yeah. -You know, maybe I will come close my eyes for a little bit. Lie down. -You wanna go and play Snakes on the phone? -Yeah. Then go inside. [grunting] Worse than my sufferings is that we put him through all that. Yeah, but he's here though, isn't he? He's healthy. -Rollercoaster, right? -Yeah, you said it'd be. Alright, I've got mine open. Oh, Reef! That's so nice, thank you! Beautiful drawings, babe. Those hearts are fantastic! Here's another one. It's so good. Get your bags. Have you gotta pee, no? Are you sure? Got your snacks, then? [melancholy music] [sobbing] [Kate vomiting] Listen, I think you should go in, okay? I can't. [Dr. Adams] It looks and sounds like a lung infection. The chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have caused damage. You might have had a latent tuberculosis which was triggered. But we're gonna cover all the bases. We'll have test results in a matter of days. [coughing] It doesn't fit anymore. We'll just get it adjusted, eh. [weeping softly] [laughing and chattering on home video] [coughing] [Singe on home video] Again? Clear the way, clear the way! [melancholy music] [Dr. Adams] Kate, I have bad news. Neither the chemotherapy, nor the radiotherapy has worked. And the secondary cancer has spread to your lungs and your bones. [sighing] Further chemotherapy is not going to help. We've done all we can. Your lungs are damaged, but we can drain them regularly and frequently. Why? [coughing] Sorry, why do we need to drain them? Why didn't you tell me sooner? How much time do I have? How much? Call Singe. I want Singe. I want him here. This is too soon. I need him here. This isn't right, this is too soon! I'm not ready for it to be this soon! There's stuff we need to do, it's too soon! [Kate sobbing] [melancholy music] -Bye. -Come on, let's go, let's skedaddle. -Oh, nice, yeah. Catch that one. -Blow a kiss. Spread it on your face, let's go. -Bye, Mommy. -Bye, darling. [knocking] I love you. ¶ I promised you a miracle ¶ [Singe] Happy birthday, Kate.

Yeah, yeah, that's fine, I'm just checking, yeah? But somewhere private, I don't want people seeing. Outside the back door. No one ever goes there. Perfect. -Nine prompt! -See you there. ¶ Promised you a miracle ¶ [dance music from inside] [Singe] I thought you said nine prompt? It is nine prompt! -You're just keen. -Oh... Alright, how's that? There you go. Happy birthday again. Thank you, again. [tender music] Do you believe in soul mates? I reckon you can make me. [Kate reading] I promise to love you forever, kiss you every time you come home, make you smile, surprise you, always be there. [breathing heavily] -[Singe] So, what's this? -[Kate] It's a contract. -[Singe] Yeah, but for who? -[Kate] For you. -[Singe] What, you want me to sign a contract? -[Kate] Yes. You actually want me to sign a contract to prove that I love you? -Singe! -No, no, no, look, I'll sign it. I'm just saying, a contract? [laughs] -This is important, Singe! -Yeah, I know! -Are you able to sign it? -Yes! Are you willing to sign it? [giggling] -You haven't even signed it. -Yeah, well, I'm kissing you! God, you're so bossy. [Kate] I love you yards and yards. I love you miles and miles. -Acres and acres. -Oh, that's a good one. I love you acres and acres. Yeah, I like that, that's the one to beat. Singe, I just told you I loved you acres and acres. Yeah, I know, and I just told you you won. -[Kate grunting] -Okay, okay! I love you acres and acres. [weeping] [panting] [Singe] You finish your Cocoa Puffs? Yeah? Okay, I'll just be back in a sec. What is it? Singe? [heaving] I don't think I can do this without you, Kate. Yes, you can. -No, I don't. -Singe, you can. No, I don't, I don't. I don't because [heaving]. [Kate] Darlin'. I don't, darlin', because [crying]. Come here. [Singe sobbing] Singe. You can. [breathing heavily] [tender piano music] Kiss the boys two times after I've gone. Hang pictures of us in their room. And measure me on the doorframe. Mommy was five feet one inch and a bit, size five feet. Mommy loved Finn's laugh and how he sucked his thumb and folded his ear in. She liked walks down the river bank and catching crabs. She liked learning butterfly names and bird names. And she'd loved to have hand-fed a wild tarpon like she used to feed the squirrels. Rachel's good for parenting advice. She has two boys the same age gap. Always kiss goodbye and goodnight. Grow a sunflower every now and again. And I'd love the boys to find four leaf clovers. Don't fill your outside with boats, give them space to play. Would like school photos bought each year. One day they'll thank you. I'd love the boys to find one of those fairy mushrooms. You know, the red ones with white bits on? And take them for walks along Mommy's favorite beach where she used to go as a child. [seagulls cawing] Finn's cuddles were always special. And I loved Reef-cuddles at night. Infinity elves. Take them to Lundy and an international rugby game. And buy a boat with seats so they can sit and watch the sea to their heart's content. I'd love it if Reef would learn recorder and guitar, and Finn the drums and keyboard. Go see the Northern Lights. Take them to where Daddy proposed to Mommy. Mommy loved moths and snakes and slow worms and orange club biscuits. And jam and jelly and lemon curd. I loved ivory roses and daisies and gypsophila. And guinea pigs and butterflies. And walnut whips and strawberry cheesecake. And Singe's pepper sauce. Celebrate birthdays big time. I know you will. Kiss goodbye, even if leaving for a short while. And take lots of pictures of my beautiful boys, especially in their teens. And please keep using the phrase acres and acres. I love that! I love that. My mom to arrange the funeral. Always help the boys if they ask. Teach them to respect women. Teach them to be on time and to say what they mean. Don't let them smoke and remind them why. Mommy loved how sparkly their eyes were in Lapland. Remember, joint bank accounts under your name and ask Dad to help with finances. Never leave more than a week before making up. Life's too short. I'd like drawings and pictures of the boys and Christmas cards and birthday cards. I'd like those in with me. And then, put me on top of the wardrobe for a while with the cuddly toys. Just for a while. Just... Just for a little bit longer. [knocking] -Hello. -You okay? Yeah, I'm alright. Shall I come in? -Mm-hmm. -Alright. [crowd chattering] -It's a lovely place. -Yeah, it is, it's a funny little town. You get beautiful sunsets down by the sea. Do you mind me asking how you're coping since you lost your wife? Oh, sorry, that was a bit abrupt, wasn't it? No, no, not at all, no, it wasn't abrupt. I'm ju-- it's just I'm not used to people asking, you know. -Not like that. [laughs] -Oh, God, I really have put my foot in it, haven't I? No, you haven't, no, um... -It's actually quite refreshing. -You don't have to answer, honestly. It's refreshing to be asked that directly and I do want to answer because I'm actually quite interested to hear what I have to say on the subject. [laughs] Oh, bloody hell, how am I coping? Um... I'm just trying to think of a way that... Okay, it's like I'm standing on a shoreline, you know on a beach or whatever and it's like getting hit with um, wave after wave, you know. And then, you get hit by the waves, the undertow will suck you under. Um, and then sometimes it feels like it's, you know, that you're not gonna be able to get out. You know, you can't breathe and um, it's like totally... And then, and then you know time passes, doesn't it? And then, the waves are still there, and they're still hitting you, and your feet are unsteady, you know. But you do get out. And then when you, when you're out, you find that you're just ever so slightly further up the shoreline. I suppose it's one way of putting it. [laughs nervously] Bloody hell, sorry, carry on. Don't let me ruin the evening. -More wine? -Oh, yeah, go on, darling, thank you. Um, I mean, one thing I do worry about is that I've got two little boys. And, um, I'm just worried I'm indulging them too much. They're happy, Singe. That's all Kate ever wanted. So you must be doing something right. Yeah, thank you. [seagulls cawing] [crowd chattering] ¶ You only get one life ¶ ¶ And I'm gonna live it ¶ ¶ I wanna give it to you ¶ ¶ No more goodbyes ¶ [crowd chattering and shouting] -How would you get someone with that? What would you do? -Poke him in the eye! Poke him in the eye. [children shouting] ¶ Keeps my feet on this Earth ¶ [all cheering and laughing] -[Singe] Are you stuffing your face? -There you go. [Singe] Everyone, it's cake time! [all cheering] ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ ¶ Happy birthday, dear Reef ¶ ¶ Happy birthday to you ¶ [Singe] Blow them out, yay, yay! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! [fading out] Hip hip, hooray! [melancholy music] [Singe] She wanted to be the best mom in the world, you know. She is the best mom in the world. Was. What? You said is. -Well, she still is. -I suppose. -Do you know what premature means? -No. -Um, does it mean you're like-- -What? -Come out of the tummy? -Come out too early? Yeah when you come out too early. Good boys, yeah. Um, so, you come out too early, right, you were premature. So you were, yeah. So you were in one area of the hospital and your mommy was in another area of the hospital. -And then you, you were off-- -In a different place. Getting-- in another place getting your chemotherapy and that, right? So, um, it was horrible 'cause we were all on our own and we were all lonely and, um, I used to rush from place to place to place. Um, and uh, it would have been about two weeks, oh, it's crazy, it would have been about two weeks, yeah, before she got to hold you both together, right? And um, she always said that that was the best moment of her life when she got you there for the first time in her arms. [Singe] How many gears are there? -Usually six. -Five. -See, there's one, two, three? -What do you think of stuff? -In your hand. -The boy who rides it, will get loads of things. -Yeah. -I got mine for my birthday. What are you gonna move it with when I do that? I've been thinking. I'm gonna get my handprint-- Yeah, thanks. My handprint put on a canvas and I thought it'd be nice if we all did it. What color? Any colors we want. -Brown? -Sure. -Hmm-mm. -What color do you want for your handprint? -What color do you want? -Green! -You want green? -Yeah. -I want red and blue. -Do you now? -Sure you want brown, mate? -Yeah. -Like poo brown? -[Finn giggles] Yeah. Alright, I better go shopping then. -Bro? -Oh, hello mate, thank you. -Thanks so much for sorting this out. -No worries. -No, it's cool. -That's a nice size, isn't it? Yeah, I think it should be alright. -Okay, let's have a look. -A few colors. Let's see. Oh, yeah, you got the brown, he wanted the brown. -Yeah, yeah. -How's it wash off? Should be nice, just soap and water. -Oh, yeah? -Should be easy, yeah. Alright, sweet. -Thanks, bro. -Oh, no worries. [Singe] Okay, let's go. Okay. -[Kate] That's rather a lot. -A bit more, knock yourself out. -Shhh... -And nice, sweet as a nut. -Oh, that's a relief. -[Finn] It's a sausage! [Singe] Oh, I feel so much better now. Shall we do Mom's one? Okay, that's it. Alright, let's put your hand in first. -[Kate] Ready, one? -[Singe] On one, okay. What's the secret here? Spread your fingers out. One, two. Da, da! Okay. Oh! -I can't [indistinct] it. -[Kate coughing] [Singe] Careful. Hold it there. -It's done, give it a go. -Yeah? [Singe] Aww, beautiful. Ah, there you go, wonderful. [all chattering] Ah, that's nice. [Reef] A massage, massage on your hand. [Singe] There you go. -Ready? -[Singe] Yeah. Hang on. I have to press those down. My pinky's gone in the poo. [Singe] Okay. Yeah, you get the idea, don't you? [Reef] Was brown really my favorite color? [Singe] [laughs] Yeah, you said it was. I don't like brown anymore. [Singe chuckles] Things change, don't they, eh? -Yeah. -Okay. Time for bed now, mate. Get up on your feet, take your gown off, ok. Take this off. Wait, give it here, up you go. Okay, my darling boys. In you go. Good lad. Good boy. Acres and acres, boys. Acres and acres. -What? -Something you might wanna see. Like what, have you been going out on me? I better watch how much I drink. How do you mean, what? Oh, no, stop that. Are you sure? -Yeah! -[giggles] [tender music] Is that the line, family, but you're supposed to do another one there, right? Oh, fuck, you done loads. -I can't believe it. -[Kate giggling] Oh, no, Katie. We're gonna be a family, Singe. Oh, no. We're gonna be complete. ¶ You know it all Then it's gone ¶ ¶ Grow, grow ¶ ¶ You know I'm here holding on ¶ ¶ Tying up your loose ends ¶ Hello, Finn. Oh, my darlin'. Hello, my gorgeous boy. I've been wanting to hold you for weeks. Weeks and weeks. Oh, my darlin'. [Singe] Hello, I've got someone else for you to hold as well. [Kate crying] Do you want to see the new baby? Go on, darling, off you go with your mama. My darlin'. My darlin' boys. This is perfect now. Just perfect. ¶ Oh, so you know it all Then it's gone ¶ ¶ Grow, grow ¶ ¶ You know I'm here holding on ¶ ¶ Tying up your loose ends ¶ ¶ And your drifting esteem ¶ ¶ Grow, grow ¶ ¶ If you never try You'll never know ¶ ¶ Grow, grow ¶ How am I supposed to even start thinking about that, Kate? You know I can't, I can't do that. Read the rest of it. Somebody there for them for when they just need to, to lean. [hopeful piano music] ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ Throw your arms out ¶ ¶ And grow your heart out ¶ This is nice. This is nice. ¶ Throw your arms out ¶ ¶ And grow your heart out ¶ ¶ Grow, grow ¶ Now, kisses. Come on, big kisses. [sobbing] -[seagulls cawing] -[waves rushing] ¶ Nothing's impossible ¶ -¶ This life is a treat ¶ -Oh, well, of course! -¶ You can leap from the sky ¶ -Hi, you! [all chattering] Hello, Daddy! How are you? Nice to see you. Hello, Mommy, how are you? -Nice to see you. -Do you want a cuppa? -Got any beers? -Yes. -I'm on holidays. -[Dad laughs] ¶ It works, it works ¶ ¶ When you don't say goodbye ¶ There you go. Straight into the games, is it? That's what I like to see. Playtime. -I wanna be playing. -You mind if I leave them with you just for a second while I get the bags unpacked? ¶ Well I know, I know ¶ ¶ This way you'll be around ¶ -We've got teas, guys. -Here they come. -I'll take this one over. -Yeah. -Here you go. -Thank you, darling. -How are you? -Good, how are you? -Good, thank you. -Yes. -Gorgeous day, isn't it? -It's beautiful. -You alright, bro? -What's happening, brother? -Wonderful day. -Isn't it just? -Come on, go for a dip. Be like the Singe of old. -What are you talking about? -Oh, go on. -While the sun's out. It's nippy, mate. So what about the kids? They've got their swimmers. -So what? -[Matt chuckles] -Do you dare me? -Yeah, there's no one about. -You're only among family. -Yeah, but you haven't seen my body, darling. -[all laughing] -Alright, bugger, I'm gonna! -You're next. -[Singe] Alright, boys, check this out. -[Dad] Boys, what is your dad doing? -[Mom laughing] You alright? [Matt whistling] It's a bit nippy, mate. Alright. I love you all. See ya. [cheering and clapping] [all whooping] [waves crashing] -You alright, boy? -Yeah, alright, Dad, yeah. I'm just... I just keep seeing ghosts everywhere. Hmm... Good ghosts. When your Mom and I visited Kate one time there was an elderly lady in for tests. Can't remember which hospital, one of the many. And we got talking to her. And she told us she'd lost her husband and now it was her turn. That's exactly how she put it. She wasn't scared. She knew these were her last days. But she'd always been thankful for each and every one of them. Every morning is the beginning of the rest of your life. -It's quite sweet. [laughs] -Yeah. That's what she said. Kate knew that, I think. Each day as it comes. So long as you make the most of every single damn minute of it. -You cold? -No. -No, it's a beautiful evening. -See you in a bit. Yeah, I'll just stay here for a bit. [somber music] Why don't you go home, Singe, get some proper sleep? We've got your numbers. Acres and acres, my darling. Acres and acres. And acres. And acres. -[horn honking] -[Singe gasping] [somber tinkling music] -[cell phone buzzing] -[Singe gasping] Hello? [Singe panting] [knocking] -Oh, God! -Jane, it's time! -Singe. -Would you mind coming? -I'll be right over. -Thanks. [melancholy dramatic music] She's been holding on for you. What, crisps for the car? Yeah, they're not on the list, are they? Cheese and onion, are you sure, mate? Do you remember when you threw up in the car after you'd been eating them and your sick smelled like cheese and onion crisps? -Some orange club biscuits. -Orange club biscuits. -Yeah, that's it. Jam. Strawberry, please, my lord. -Jam. -I found it. -Ok, yeah, jelly, actually. Yeah, very good, well done. Alright, moving on, what else do we need? Uh, lemon curd, back with the jams. Where is it, can you see it? Down there. Get it, nice one. -So, this is Mom's birthday? -No, darling, it's Mother's Day and we're gonna celebrate it every year 'cause it's a very special day for us. Um, okay, wait up, lads. We've got, right, crisps, popcorn, walnut whips. There's three on the list and there's about 19 in here. -Did you do that? -He did! -Did you? -He did! -Maybe, no. -Yeah, tell the truth. Alright, what else do we need? No fighting, please, thank you. Oh, mate. [grunting] Christ alive, I feel sick now. Right. Before we're done let's have a toast, okay? To Mom, get your little glass. Get your glass, put your glass up. Right, and, um, Mom always used to say that you can never um, laugh too much, you can never learn too much, you can never care too much, you can never love too much. So-- -But you can eat too much. -Yeah, you can eat too much. [laughs] -[glasses clinking] -Cheers, cheers. Alright, down it, down it. No, don't down it you'll be sick. -Oh! -Nice! -So, yeah, there is a new table -and a new umbrella thing. -Lovely table! It really cheers the place up. Now Daddy's allowed a friend for tea. Just the one friend? 'Cause I was thinking, there's six chairs. So, if it were me, Daddy and Finn, that would leave three extra. But if Mommy were here, that would mean there's only two extra spaces left for me and Finn's friends. But, now Mommy's gone, she wanted us to have a big table so Daddy can have a friend, too. -Sounds like you've got it all worked out! -Yes. [Grandpa laughing] Oh, Andrea, yeah, no, yeah, yeah! She was at your dinner thing, wasn't she? No, she's nice. -She's okay if you ever wanna give her a call. -Oh, really? Yeah, as in, when you wanna get out there. Have a drink or a meal. Yeah, she's up for it. So, shall I give you her number? It's just a date, Singe. Just, it's not a marriage proposal. It's just getting used to going out with a woman again. I know, I know, it's just that, I haven't been single since I was 13. You know, I'm a little bit out of practice. Okay. Okay. -But? -But? -So? -So? Look, it's like you say, it's as in when, isn't it? You know? I'll hold you to that. Don't doubt it, mate. It's all clear, Singe, the scan. It's all clear. -[heaving] -Your son's in full remission. [crying] [crowd chattering] Right, okay, you lot, we're gonna take a photograph of everyone. All of us around Reef. So if I could get my two sisters, Kay and Luce, down in the front with me. My two lovely moms. If you go over to the side, yeah, that's it, perfect. -Yeah, thanks very much. And the boys at the front, yeah. -Singe! -How many you had, Nige? I want your hands where I can see 'em. -Okay, Singe? -You don't wanna repeat your Christmas-- Yeah? -You get in the photo, -I'll take it. -No, that's alright, darling, I've got the timer. -Oh, okay! Then I'll get in it? -Alright, pop yourself in. Yeah, you, of course, yeah. Ten seconds from-- -[Rachel] Right, come on, Singe! -Now! -[Rachel] You're gonna miss it! -[all] Come on! Sorry, I don't know if it's gone off. -[all yelling] -Yeah, it's going, it's going! -[all] Five, four-- -It's not New Year's Eve! [all] Three, two, one! To Reef! Hold it there. -I don't think it's gone off. -No, it didn't. -It stopped flashing, though. -I think I heard it. [engine revving] [boys whooping] [Reef] I can see her! I can see where she is! -[Finn] Hi, Mom! -Hi, Mom! Daddy, say hi to Mom! Acres and acres, darling! [Reef] Acres and acres! [Finn] Acres and acres! [hopeful music] [birds chirping] Miss you so much. But I'm doing alright, I'm doing okay, you know. It's like, it's like, um it's like time has been working its way under my skin and, uh, without me knowing it, and fixing cuts and mending bruises and stuff. I just can't get my head around how much things have changed, you know. But maybe that's not time, maybe that's you, maybe that's you doing that. [melancholy music] I promise you that whatever life throws at us and me that I will explore, just like you always said. 'Cause life's been good before and it will be good again. And I will make the most of every moment. For the boys. So, are we at the, as in when? I don't know. I honestly don't know. Stop it. Well, that's life's big adventure, isn't it? -Nothing more nor less. -No. -Singe? -Hmm? You're gonna be fine. Hello? Hi, is it Andrea? It's, uh, yeah, it is, yeah. How'd you know? Oh, did she? When did she get-- Oh, okay. Well, that's pretty cheeky of her. [Rachel] You wanna do it? [Reef] It's not yours. Alright? How do I look? -Uh, nice? -Handsome. Well, thank you. What? -The tie. -You don't like it? -You don't need it. -It's a bit corporate, isn't it? Like a geography teacher. Geography teacher? That's a bit strong. Should I get it off? Okay. I'll undo a button, though, 'cause I don't wanna go all like, you know what I mean. Is that better? Better. Alright, thank you. Enjoy. [tender music] Okay.
