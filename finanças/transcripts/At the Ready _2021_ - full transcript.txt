Here's the schedule. Active shooter at 12. Hostage negotiation 1:30, and then drug raid at 2:30. Alright, equipment check. Go drug raid. Make sure radios are working when you guys are over there. Alright, somewhere in this world somebody is doing this right now, for reals, right? All this stuff, it only makes you stronger, alright? You guys are all partners. We're family. "Scorpions" on three! One, two, three, Scorpions! Get in your position. Do we take our guns out already? No. You have a search warrant for a house at 1315 Pebble Hills. Okay, you're looking for... José Durán, and he has a warrant for manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance. So, you'll be searching the house for a controlled substance in the house. Okay, once you guys cross this threshold, you're in role. - Are you guys good? - Ready. - Yell it out. - Ready? - Ready. - In role. Let me see your hands! Let me see your hands! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Let me see your hands! Get on the ground! On the wall for my safety and your safety. You're trespassing. This will go all over Facebook, I promise you. You're trespassing... You're trespassing property, alright? We need you to face away from... You need to back off. I already feel threatened. We need to conduct an actual warrant... Look at what they're doing in America now. El Paso, Texas, is the largest city on the U.S.-Mexico border. It also has the highest rates of immigrants in the country. Our police department is why we are considered one of the safest cities. They put the law enforcement program in schools. That way students can see the real life view. El Paso police officers looking to engage with local youth and leave a positive impression. I decided to try to be in the Border Patrol Explorer Program. It's a really good opportunity. I would get work experience already and be on track for my dream career. Teens kicking down doors, rounding up bad guys, even firing guns on a mission. It may sound a lot like a video game, but it's not. My dreams are to get a spot in law enforcement. If I do it right, then as soon as I get my high school diploma, I'll probably get hired. The Border Patrol makes no secrets about the difficulties of the job. Border Patrol agents make just over $50,000 their first year and can make almost 100 grand by their fifth. Being in the Criminal Justice Club, it made me more interested in pursuing law enforcement. I would love to be a police officer and I would love to do drug raids and SWAT. El Paso and other cities and towns along this border are consistently among the safest in the nation. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime, their rapists. We do not need mine resistant ambush protected vehicles. We do not need grenade launchers. We do not need armed drones. We do not need to militarize the border. Good morning, Scorpions. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Law Enforcement One is all about policing. So, you guys are going to learn like the basics, how to handcuff, how to lift fingerprints. How to do traffic stops, how to do verbal commands. You're going to learn about the use of force. It's going to be paramilitary style. No tardiness. As far as I'm concerned, in the law enforcement community, that's a sign of disrespect. So, it's a good career. Like I said, you're there to help people, right? But sometimes those people don't like you. When I was in narcotics, I can remember the day. August 7, 2007. The biggest drug bust I had, 2,300 pounds of marijuana. People are looking up to you. People need you to do great things. I want to know your name, why you're in this program. I want to be a police officer so I can end up being, like, in the narcos unit, or a detective, or something. That's good. I could see you doing that too. And you, sweetie? I'm probably thinking about joining the Marines. And then go to a Border Patrol and join a special team. - Yeah, like BORTAC? - Mm-hm. Boss people around. -And you, sweetie? -Customs. - Nice. - And a police officer. I can picture you guys in your uniforms already. And it's so cool, like I... This is my tenth year teaching here at Horizon High School, teaching law enforcement. And a lot of my students that I had when I first started have jobs in law enforcement. And it's so neat to see that the jobs are there. There's, like, so many jobs in law enforcement. All of you guys have the potential of doing it. It's just staying focused, don't get in trouble. And just train. That's all it is. So, that was like a real quick trailer. Most of the club meetings, we're practicing and we're training. There's 29 competitive events that you can participate in. Kassy, do you want to tell the class what you liked about the club? You go in wanting to learn more about criminal justice and wanting to, like, get more of a hands-on figure and you come out, like, with a family and more of a... like, a place in your heart for them. It's kind of great having that relationship with people. We still communicate with seniors that left last year. Like, they were here just two periods ago. Just to remind us that they're there, if we need anything, that they'll come and help out. I still don't, like... process the fact that I'm, like, graduated already. I feel like that club is like a family, because... we're just so connected to each other and we just support each other. It's pretty exciting to see what's up with this new year, and, like, the new chain of command and new members. Border Patrol hiring in El Paso, New Mexico. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the largest law enforcement agency in the country, has hundreds of vacancies for law enforcement officers nationwide. El Paso, Texas and Columbus, New Mexico are among the areas where there are jobs openings with opportunities for agents to earn $51,484 with overtime. $51,484 with overtime. My dad came over here to have a better life. I'm the first one that's going to go to college and go into a major career and stuff. I knew I was forgetting something, my love. My dad, he's like, this is what I want to do, like, work for you to be successful in life. And I know that I'm making them proud. Okay. Two minutes, two minutes, walk it off. Like, I feel the excitement, because like, I know, like, what's going to happen to you in the next few months, and how everything's going to change for you. And that's, like, so exciting. I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. - I'm so, so happy. Let's go tell that news to the rest of the teachers. -You want to tell them? -Yeah. Okay, yay, let's go in there and tell them. Alright guys, we have some, like, super, super cool news from Valerie. She just got hired to be a corrections officer, So her job is going... Tell what your duties were going to be. Yeah, well, they told me to make sure that everyone's alive and that, yeah, that they don't have, like, any weapons or anything like that. Yeah, make sure that they're safe, and that their welfare's okay, that they're healthy. Yeah, and check, like, their cells and make sure it's clean, and... And count to make sure that they stay... Oh, yeah, make sure that all the inmates were there. -Yeah. -That's awesome. We're very proud of you. Rock solid. So many great things are going to happen for you, you're going to see. You're in. You made it. I know those are tears of joy. Alright, so we're going to start some interviews. I know there are some nervous students outside. - Thank you, sir. - Congrats, girl. -I'm so proud of you, Valerie. -Thank you. Yay. - Yay. - That is so cool. Oh, no, I'm so excited. - Anthony. - Anthony. - Good afternoon. - Hello. -Afternoon. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, sir. -Good afternoon. Go and have a seat, sweetie. Alright, so tell us why you would be the best candidate to lead the Criminal Justice Club, and explain. I listen to everybody's problems. If somebody has a problem, we fix that, because our objective is all the same, to compete and try to win. I have a pretty loud voice. I can give commands. I like teaching people and sharing my experiences with other people as well. I also want to, like, promote the club more, like, go to the middle schools. To get members to participate more, you have to give them that goal for them to feel like it's a duty. The Criminal Justice Club is kind of my family, and so I want to help improve it. And I want to help make it more organized and make it more stable. Okay, I like how you said about the club being a family, because everybody gets really close, huh? So, then that concludes the interview. Thank you for applying for the position, and we'll let you know by tomorrow. I told all of them that... we're going to look at everybody as a whole that applied. And we're going to take into consideration the way that they interviewed, how we know them, then we're going to accommodate their strengths and their weaknesses and the needs of the club. You guys know how much time it takes to run the club. We don't want to set them up for failure. Okay, who do you want to recommend? I don't know, guys. I really don't know. I didn't expect this, to be honest with you. Oscar? We just don't have that trust. You've worked so hard for this. - I don't... - Kassy? I think if we put Ivan, it sends a strong message to our club that we're not playing any games. You want a stronger message, you should put Kassy. I'll be honest, I don't trust... I don't trust Ivan. I don't trust any of them up there. Kassy got involved, she would help every time. Really, I mean, I came here wanting Oscar, but I keep thinking, and I keep seeing the same problems, and I think we should make Kassy the commander, that's good. Okay, so, Kassy? The loyalty and the commitment are, like, right. 110%. You, yes? You, yes? I'm home by myself in the mornings, because my dad is a truck driver. And he goes to work at two in the morning. So, I'm normally home alone when I wake up. It's been like that since, like, I was... an eighth grader when my parents got divorced. Being alone has its perks, because, like, I get to, like, I feel like I manage myself. And I like that, but then it gets lonely, because no one's here. I joined the club and it gave me a way to be around people and not feel lonely anymore. Everybody grab a gun. What's that? Don't do that. - Bad boys? - Bad boys. - Hi. - It's fine. Hi, the holding of the gun. The finger off the trigger. It's always center mass when you're shooting somebody. Guide comes up to the head. If you have to drop down, you go with it. I keep everything in close. Don't go too far out. There's no Charlie's Angels. You just got to feel comfortable, because the stress, it's like being, like, in a haunted house. You don't know where they're going to pop out. Know what to do. Alright, who needs a gun? - Everybody has one? - Yes, sir. Alright, well, let's try a lineup outside. I try explain to them, you're going to get tunnel vision, everything's going to go dark. You're not going to be able to hear things. You're going to forget things. Team, door to the right, moving. Then once they start experiencing it, and we're putting a little fear into them, their adrenaline starts going.. Breach it, breach it, breach it. ...they come out and they say, "Wow, that was so scary" and they get maybe more interested and like, "I want to do it again." And it becomes a thrill for them. Beautiful, beautiful. He has to be quick. He either has to neutralize a threat, or he has to say, "Subject, subject, subject." And that point the discipline would be Kassy would come out. Alright, now you have two guns. Can you go 3D? Yes. But then Cesar would have to go all the way out there, because if somebody comes out of Guerra's room, you're here. Team, move. And once they got that, we want them to have that little bit of confidence to say, "Yo, I can actually go do it for real now." Where do I go? Alright, job guys. Really, really good. I'm really impressed. Ah, yes. You can hear it on the radio. Customs is hiring. Border Patrol is hiring. That's how I got interested in law enforcement. I can still remember the commercial. "If you are interested in the El Paso Police Department, becoming an officer and helping your community..." I can still remember him talking and I thought about it and I says... "Maybe that could be interesting. I might want to try it." Oh, damn, okay. Damn it, I hate car seats. Done. If you view it, like, in a Mexican family way, the dad is the one that's always working and the mom is one that is always in the house cleaning and getting food read. Because my dad is not here, my mom is the one that is working and then I'm the one that pretty much take care of all the chores of my mom. He wants to be a policeman. When I was crossing the border last night, this officer came up to me and asked me what I wanted to do when I graduated. I was kind of excited because it's like, it's a... like, it's a branch that I'm actually interested in working in. So, I told him that I wanted to follow a law enforcement like path and that I wanted to get my degree. He told me not to get my degree yet and go straight into Customs, because they needed people. He gave me the paper with all the information in there, and then I told him, "Yeah, I'll take a look at it." They said that it was like a job that was already, like, secure for you, that they will get you regardless, so... That's a good thing. Ow! Alright, so it's always great for me to get the opportunity to come in and speak to guys here at the high school, because now everybody's recruiting early, right? So, this is my opportunity to try and recruit you early. You want to go law enforcement? Great way to start here. And it's a job that pays good. You can be a detention officer, and then later become a deputy. So different positions that we have. Where else can I have a job where I knock on somebody's door, right? And I say, FBI, I'd like to speak to you. So, Border Patrol works along the river on the border. ICE is interior into the United States. They raid places. That's actually in our academy in the classroom. Yeah, we provide all the training, and it's fun. So, there's a lot of opportunities. Questions? My dad got deported on July of this year. And are they following up on the paperwork? That's what the lawyer is supposed to be doing, right? Oh, he was here, like, ten years already trying to fix his papers. I don't know what the process is with HSI or ICE right now. I don't know how they're doing it, because it's constant. It's a constant thing that's changing right now. There's no set guidelines as to what's going on. You growing up in El Paso, predominantly in a Hispanic culture. You're an asset if we need to go into that environment to talk to people, recruit people to help us solve crimes, because understanding the culture and being able to connect with people is really what it's all about. We're still here, sorry. Cell extraction. I'm going to tell you this, immediately, we're going to start training for this, okay? If you're not here, guys, how can we train you? If you're not here, how can you participate? Because at the end, we're going to show up to that competition, and we're showing up to win. I know you have a big heart, but we need more than a big heart. We need to win. And we're going to put our best players that gives us the best opportunity to win. - Do you understand that? - Yes, sir. So, commander Kass. We have finally made teams for border challenge, which is great. We appointed Kassy CJ commander, and she's done a very great job. I always wondered if she was going to be one of those leaders, and she is. I'm just letting you guys know right now that I need you guys to be there at practice. And we have a three strike warning for practices. If you guys don't show up, you'll most likely be kicked out of the event. I'm currently enrolled in community college. I'm doing two years, getting my associate's. Okay, I am here because I'm interested in your career choice. That was the assignment to have the opportunity to explore your career path, because it's a core project that this class is responsible for. To go out in the field and meet someone that's actually doing this career choice that you're interested in. And then you have the opportunity to interview them. - Good luck. - Thank you. Now you can pull it up. So hi, my name is Cristina Martinez, and my dream job is Border Patrol. And it has interested me just basically about protecting the border since it has been like my home my entire life. So, I interview Agent Flores. So, I asked what are the good and bads about being in Border Patrol? So, he answered with "The good of Border Patrol is a good paying career, which pays well financially and good medical insurance to take care of your family. The bad is the long hours. Also being Latino and living on the border city, civilians see us as the enemy and they don't see the good we do for the community. We provide gifts for low-income families for Christmas, and turkeys for Thanksgiving. Yet they see us as family wreckers. I've been yelled at, cursed at, spit on, and punched at, just because of what I do. Yet people that hate us always have their handout for free. In your perspective, can anyone do that job? It's a very scary job working along with backup 15 minutes to 20 minutes away. It takes a certain mind frame to be able to run into danger while people run away, or deal with people clinging onto asking for help while doing the job." Great. Great job, Cristina. And now that you had this conversation with this particular person in this field, are you sure this is something that you really want to do, despite the questions that you asked him and the responses he gave you? Yeah, it's still, I don't know, it still interests me. And then BORTAC, which is like the Border Patrol SWAT team, it really interests me just... I don't know, I like the dangerous stuff. So... Nice. Well, congratulations. I think you will make a great Border Patrol agent -one day. -Thanks. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, who's my next person? To get here, most migrants cross this river between Guatemala and Mexico. Some entered legally through this bottlenecked bridge. I will seal off the border before they come into this country. And I'll bring out our militar, not our reserves, I'll bring out our military. A lot of crazy things happening. If you guys have been watching the news, and everybody knows about the caravan that's coming. The Texas National Guard is getting activated to come down to protect the borders. So, how do you guys feel about that? Like, I support it. You support it? You think it's a good idea? Okay, anybody think no? Me, I'm against it. I want to have a debate. So right now, we're going to split up into two sides, and talk amongst yourselves and come up with, like, a rebuttal. What if there's a misfire or there's a casualty? But we don't know where they're going to stay, and then we don't know, like... because I'm pretty sure they don't have money. Bringing the military here to the border for this as preparation is like drinking medicine when you're not even sick. Exactly. It's like, what are you even, like, preventing? Nothing's even happening. Cesar, is your team ready? Since Oscar, he's for the military and the Texas National Guard being at the border, tell us like one reason, just one, why you feel that way. Like, I'm for the military coming to the border, because we're going to be more protected. Like, there's going to be more safety, and... Alright. Yes. I understand the situation that we're going through right now. And I do understand that military will make you feel safe in a way, but take in consideration that using force or forcing people to stay away is not always going to be the answer to keep people safe on this side. Because if something happens on the Mexican side, it's going to affect a lot of people on the American side, and especially because it's mostly Hispanics here in El Paso. So, you need to take in consideration how's it going to affect both sides if you put the military in between. So, what you're saying is, like, if they do use force, that it's going to cause conflict in the Mexican side. And if there's conflict, like say, they start fighting and they become violent, that's going to affect us over here on this side, because there's ties, like, family ties between the two. We have students in this classroom that do that, that go back and forth a lot. They need help. If you were in their position, wouldn't you like for people to help you? Why are we going to go through everyone's background, everyone's education and spend a lot of money, your money, my money, I work, my taxes. Why are we going to do that? I don't understand. Joshua lives in Juarez. To be continued, to be continued. Good debate, guys. We must unite. I wasn't really participating in the debate, because they weren't discussing them as people, they were discussing them as, like, pests. And some of them even have family that are immigrants, and they still have these viewpoints on it. It, like, makes me upset, and I don't exactly understand it sometimes. Want to tell 'em? You can tell them. My God. Hey, guys, you need to get on that side. Nobody can be on the bottom. Yeah, sorry, It's because people drop stuff, and we don't want him to get hurt. Hey, guys, we need you guys to walk on the sidewalk, please. We should definitely adjust it. I mean... No, no, they're not doing anything bad. They're just in love. That's young love right there. Timeout taken by Hanks at the 10:30 mark of the fourth quarter. - So, stressing? - Stressing. - Stressing, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Oh, man, this year we started late. I was, like, running around. -Yeah, because last week... -No offence. It's because we weren't able to have our meeting last week. Ready for graduation? Has the hit you, or no? - It has not. It hasn't yet. - It hasn't? Wait for that day when... I think it's going to hit me after competition, because that's how you know. Yeah, after border challenge, it affects you, because it's like, oh, shit, it's like... - That's the last one. - It's the last competition of my high school year, you know? That's when it hits you, and it's like... Take it from me, yeah? Yeah, you're coming back. Yeah, I keep coming back. Are you going to practice, or you just... Yeah. Oh, so we are going to use you? I thought you said no? I believe you're marching with them. So, I go, also go like this? - Okay, team ready? - Ready. What do I say? Let's make a little chain. - Yeah. - One, two, three. You all have to say it. Ready, ready, ready, and win it. Push and then everybody comes. That's what I just said that they all have to say it, and then someone told me no. They're doing a whole process. You're in charge of looking at everything, but you're taking care of them behind their backs, in a way. Okay? My helmet is too big, though. My helmet is falling. You're going to have to work out with that. -Alright. -Mine would go... It would literally cover my eyes. -You have to work with it. -Alright. We've got ten minutes. Ready? Alright, team. Ready, ready, ready, ready? Oh, sorry. Hands above your head! Clear. Ahh! I don't care if he has his gun pointed at you, you're going to light him up. There's a certain pressure point. So, now, Brianna's coming with you and she's coming up this way. Twist the gun away from each other. Roll! Roll! Suspect! On your knees, on your knees! Now! Again, you've got to be blocking me. Hey, beep, beep. Get on your knees, or I'm going to shoot if you don't comply. What if the guy came out just shot you guys, when you guys weren't looking? - Ready? - Ready. Ahh! Stop resisting! We're here to save the drugs. Hey, hey! Easy! Good, good. Where's the warrant? You can't be in my house without a warrant! Look, she has new moves. Alright. Coming upstairs, coming upstairs, coming up. Morning. Ready? Breach, breach. If they don't put it down, you have to yell, "bang, bang," because two to the chest and then one to the head. - Bang, bang, bang. - Bang, bitch. That's all? Woah! Students are going to be picking up the tickets. Josh and Kenny are going to be posted there to help them in case they need any help. Kassy and Carla, you guys are going to be here, basically right where you're standing, and you're going to make sure that the flow is that way. We're just waiting for the announcement and then the rush, yay! I'm inside of the small gym, so I'm on my way to the main gym. - Hazel, you look so pretty. - Thank you! Hey, guys, you're not supposed to let them go through that door. Sorry, guys. Got to go through there. Got to go through there. Right, good. Smile, be happy. Let's see your smile. This is your face. Right? It's like, everything okay? Oh, yeah, it's peachy. And your face is like... It's something that we need to discuss later. No? Everything good? Mm-hm. I want to lie down in a ditch. In a ditch? - Or and then ditch? - Yeah. No, I want to lie down in a ditch. - Hi. - Hi. How's everything? It's going alright. Everything good at home? Mm-hm. I don't know. I know it's hard. And I worry about you. I do worry about you. I know. You're doing really good, Kassy. I don't want you to stress out. And ask for help. Ask me, ask Mr. Jimenez, Mr. Nuñez, Mr. Guerra. Alright, Kassy, we'll see you tomorrow morning. -Mm-hm. -Eight o'clock. -Yes, ma'am. -Right. Try to rest. - Bye, Ms. Weaver. - Bye, sweetie. I am gay. That's something that I have to hide from literally everyone in my family. I know that she asks me about being lonely because, like, she cares about me. It's just... A lot of issues opening up because of, like, my parents and stuff. So, I don't... I don't know how to open up to someone sometimes, and I just tell them that I'm fine. When she asked about how it was at home, I would have told her that it kind of sucks, because it does. I can't be open about it to my dad, because I don't want to tell him and then get kicked out. I eat dinner by myself most nights. My dad's normally not here. He's mostly, like, with his girlfriend, or helping his girlfriend's son out, or helping one of his girlfriend's family members out, or just... Just not here. I have no idea what my dad will do if I... When I ever come out to him, because I already feel like people already look down at me. Just, I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. Just remember, so a hallway is like this, right? Yes, sir. And then we have the two point people, and we have the two wings, right? I don't want to keep repeating myself, but you all know what you're looking for. If you were this guy, you are checking the walls for any trip wire, or any possible pipe bombs. Give me your gun. You guys are going to be like this, right? If someone pops up in front of you, you're going to light them up, right? All the rest of the team, you're going to be at the ready. John Wayne kind of shit. One, two, three. The other day a group of students, they came in asked me... So, are all these high schools that we compete, are they actually going into law enforcement? And I go, "You better believe it." "Are they going to be any job openings, mister, because if they're applying for the same jobs that we're applying, then what happens?" And I go, "You got to beat them." When you're ready. Bang, bang, bang! He's down, he's down. Cover, cover! He's down. The weapon, weapon. Go, go. So, what the hell are you doing over there? Yes. What are you doing there? I just told you guys. Okay, do it again. Wait, who rushes in? Everybody. - All of them? - Everybody. Yes, we have ten guns. We have eleven guns. We need to make them work. - Let's go, let's go. - Go, go, go, go. I said the hallway was over there" I said the hallway was over there. Move! Look to the left. Look to the right. Bang, bang, bang! Cover, cover, cover. That's the way you need to yell. No one heard you. No one heard you. The more that we keep getting closer to competitions, the more I feel like we're getting farther away from being prepared for it. Go, go, go. Go through, you go through. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! I wasn't even pointing at you guys. Bang. If I have the weapon, but I'm not pointing it at you, you're going to light me up. Turn left, turn left, turn left. -Go, go, go. -Move, move, move. Police, police, police. So, check this out, guys. We cannot be struggling with a gun, okay? Look at this. Adan, I don't know what the hell you're doing with that gun. What the hell were you doing, Adan? Well, I was trying to put it away. I was... But Adan, just put it away. Just put it away. It makes me feel like I'm failing in being the leader. And I'm failing in running the club to what it should be. Move, move, move, move. Raise your hand if you guys think that shutting down the border completely would be an option as to keeping the border safe. One, two, three. Alright, so, raise your hand if you feel that no, they would not. Well, like, I'm sort of in the middle. You're in the middle? So, you're like this? You're not like that, you're like this? So, why are you in the middle, like, you're sitting on the fence, why? Like, back in history, the Chinese were trying to keep the Mongolian out of China. They built the wall to keep them out, but every single... like, even if you build a big ass line, every single line is going to have at the end, an opening. So, like there's no point of... even, like, creating something like that if there's going to be weaknesses. And so, if the people are determined to get across the border... Yes, it's going to help to keep the border, at least the border cities safe, but there's always a limit for that wall to break. And sometimes, it's just not going to hold up. They're going to figure out a way to do it. Do whatever it takes to get to the other side. Right, and then I'm going to take you away from thinking about the people are trying to cross and think about the narcotraficantes. I mean, do we have agencies, or do we have, like, a war against drugs, and we're trying to keep drugs from coming to the U.S.? Are they coming to the U.S.? Drugs? Yes. And the narcotraficantes, I mean, they are creative, right? Right. That's my uncle. And I was like, the one that... Well, like, the chiple. And then my little sister came in, and then she became the princess. This one right here. This is my dad, and he still looks like that. He hasn't changed whatsoever. Just a couple of wrinkles, the eyes, and that's it. My dad was moving drugs from Mexico to the U.S. He went to prison for about a year. At first, I was like... I was just like, I couldn't believe it. And then I was... I'm sorry. Sorry. At first, I was just like... Like, it was hard. The thing is that I don't even know why he... why he was even doing that, like, he had everything. He already had a... He already had... you can say, like, the golden ticket for a good life here. I don't even know why. Yeah, so... I don't know, whenever he... When he told us the first time, I was just like, like, in shock, and didn't know how to react to it. -Good job on your boots. -Thank you, sir. The first day I went to the Explorers Program, this large silver bus comes. And they told us that that bus is the vehicle that deports the aliens that come in. The door opens from the processing center, and there's like, seven-year-olds, eight-year-olds, and they're just walking around. They look at us and we're like, oh my God, like, we thought it would be like adults or something. And no, it was, like, minors. We were really shocked because it was, like, two views. They were there because they were chasing a dream. And they got caught. So now, they're going back, and we are there because we want to do that. So, that's like one thing I don't like to just know that I'm cutting their dreams off. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Order, arms. Amen. If so, you can drop me in the middle of the road. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Mm-hm. He didn't know that I was mad at him. I tried to talk to him, but it's kind of hard. Okay. We begin today's show with the growing outrage over the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant families. Despite mounting opposition, the Trump administration continues to faithfully defend its new policy. That march on Tornillo resonating across the country today, demonstrators showing their support for immigrant children separated from their families at the border. I am so grateful. So grateful. So grateful. So grateful, because each one of you has decided at this most moral of moments that you're going to stand up and be counted. Literally feet from here, we are holding kids, more than 200 kids who don't know when they're going to see their families again. At this moment, this is America. This is us. This is what we are doing. Shame! -They mayor. -This is neither a republican nor a democratic process. She's the little girl whose voice was heard around the nation. We're now talking about more than 2,300 children here. Ah! It's... It gets you mad. That's what hit me the most, that recording. Oh, no. It's heartbreaking just hearing them. I guess, suffer. And, like... Just... Or what's going through their mind right now, like... Where are my parents, like... You know, just wanting them to be back together. Yeah. We're finally here, thank God. At this very moment, large, well organized caravans of migrants are marching toward our southern border. Some people call it an invasion. It's like an invasion. Remember, we were having that discussion about the military having presence on the border and the caravan that's coming, and how that's going to affect us, how that's going to affect the law enforcement? And if we thought that that was good, or if that was bad. So, what do you guys think, like, after he just stated that it's an invasion. Is that going to affect the way that people perceive the caravan that's coming? Yes, people are going to see it like the way he's saying it. They're going to see it in a, like, a negative way. Even though it's not really... Like, they're going to dehumanize the people that are coming. What about how that's going to affect the military presence? Do you think it's going to affect them too? They're going to be like, "Oh, he's saying it's an invasion, obviously, these people are bad, and obviously, they want to do something." I was watching your expressions when you guys were watching, you were like... Nobody's thinking that what he was saying at the speech is going to be positive in any way. Nobody's really going to take it that way. I've met some of the ICE agents, and... They're pretty... They're good persons, like, they know their job, and they're interesting persons. And I know a lot of ICE agents, too. And I try really hard not to, I guess, have my opinion, like, imposed on you guys. I want you guys to think freely. So, I never tell you, I try not to say that I'm for or against anything, because I want you guys to be independent thinkers and learners, and seek answers for yourselves. But yeah, you're right. I mean, just like any job, teachers, doctors, there's good doctors or bad doctors. There's good teachers, there's bad teachers. I'm sure with these ICE agents, the same thing. There's good ones and there's bad ones. President Trump believes that the Democratic Party is going to influence that, and that they're going to try to cut away some of the programs that we have in law enforcement. That's going to affect us here in El Paso. Like Beto, when he cut the overtime hours? When he did that for the police officers. And then also, he took away some of the... What was it, holidays? Yeah, it took away some of those, so... I think, in a way, it would affect the law enforcement. Anybody else have anything? Alright, well, we will continue this tomorrow. -It's election day. -Yes, it is. -Yes. -It is. It's election day. Too bad I can't vote. I know you don't want to tell us who you voted for. Who did you vote for? - Well, it's no secret. - It's a secret. - I voted for Ted Cruz. - Oh. - Ted Cruz, everybody. - Oh. Ted Cruz it is. Ted Cruz. He just seems a lot more sound when it comes to law enforcement, teachers. And that comment that O'Rourke made about abolishing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, that was a frightening statement. And that was enough. That was enough for me. I still don't know who to vote for. When I was in the police department, we feel that we didn't have Beto's support. So, you're not going to be a show - at O'Rourke's after party? - No, no, no. I wouldn't be caught dead there. The things that I've learned in the club helped me better understand both sides of the story. Like, police officers, they like to show that they're conservative. It blinds them from having an unbiased opinion. Skip that class, if you have to. Do what it takes to make sure that you get out there and vote. I can't let you not see this beautiful sunset in El Paso. Those mountains that you see are in Ciudad Juarez. Make sure that you get a chance to decide this election. This is one where the stakes couldn't be any higher, and you get to decide the outcome. Up to you. I can hear Beto. Oh, my God, I'm so excited. You did good, El Paso. Is this the way to the O'Rourke rally? I think they're on the other side of the Colosseum Park. Behind the Colosseum. Thank you. Hey, where you guys get those flags? - Outside. - Really? - That was way earlier... - Ahh... That girl was cute. I got this one that says, "Hey Trump," and then it has the arms of diversity, but they're all women. And then... I got this one. What's he saying? From here he can see the future of this country. How proud, how motivated, and how much we have pride to be from here. Beto, Beto, Beto. Republicans are holding on to control of the United States Senate. There're going to be a lot of very disappointed Democrats. It's not going to happen. I'm as inspired, I'm as hopeful, as I have you ever been in my life. And tonight's loss does nothing to diminish the way that I feel about Texas or this country. As one half of the largest binational community anywhere in the Americas joined with Ciudad Juarez, to form something powerful, magical, and nothing to be afraid of, or walled off or to apologize for. Thank you, El Paso. I am grateful. Thank you. I'm wearing a button that says, "Gay." What do I do? Do I take them off? What happens when I do tell them? Like, the possibilities are endless and none of them are good. You want me to hold on to it? I guess. Like, coming out scares this shit out of me. And like, I'm not sure if Weaver knows that I'm gay, but I do know that none of the other teachers know. I don't want them to know, because I know how Guerra thinks. People who parade their gayness are disgusting and stuff. I mean, Beto losing just makes me worry, and... I know that new laws and new policies will kick in, and... I mean... it's kind of difficult to imagine me doing something, like, humanely, I guess. And... I don't know, it just makes me doubt whether to continue on this path, or... just chose something else, you know. Oscar's running late. He says that he needs to wait for his practicum uniform. I don't know where everyone else is. Would you like to speak to us, sir? If I was a cop I would just beat the shit out of everybody. Stop resisting! Okay, we only got a few minutes, so entry, remember, when you come in, don't bottle up, pass them. If you see two people, three people on somebody, pass them, make sure your corner's clear. What I loved about being a police officer was you got to feel like you really were some way, somehow, making a difference. ...right now, because he's running late, I already told you. Entries looked pretty good yesterday. The problems you guys are having are the searching. Remember, how much time do you need before you can go inside on a no-knock? - Fifteen seconds. - Fifteen seconds. And... no-knock. Police! Search warrant! Just put his hands... You want to be contact, Ivan? - Contact. - Covered. Evidence, evidence. Wait, did you take a picture? You guys are doing good. You guys are doing really well. A real narco raid, remember you guys are going in as, like, stealth ninjas. They don't know you're coming. Most of the time, if it's a drug house, people are a little bit stoned. They might be just chilling out. I took a guy down one time, and I put him on the ground handcuffing and I go, "Don't move." He's like, "Sir, that was badass, can you do that again?" I tell them stories. I sugarcoat some of them, because I didn't want them to know the times I was scared, or... There's a few I tell them, "I was terrified." If he does have a gun, he goes like that, do I shoot? Yeah, anytime somebody raises a gun to you, you shoot him. He's going to say, "Well, I didn't know they were cops." That's for the courts to decide. "Police, drop it, drop it, drop it." Then you've got to blow, bang, bang. I have PTSD. That's something you do have to learn is... how to deal with it. I can't really prepare them for that, till they're actually there. Kassy, as soon as we came in, you won't say that in competition. You'll say like, "Ivan, you want to be contact?" You have got to be sure you're like covered. And then, I'll say contact, or whoever else, because... - Because you were closer to her. - I started tripping. But it doesn't matter, like, even if you wanted to be covered, like don't ask me like, "Ivan, you want to be contact?" because that looks bad. - It's unprofessional. - Yes. Things happen. Happens to all of us. I've made more mistakes than anybody. I don't want to work you guys to death. You guys doing great. There's a lot of hypocrisy to what we do. Here I am a high school teacher. Here I am trying to influence other students, other kids to go. But yet, from my family, I was like, I don't want you to get hurt. I got divorced. And do I blame my job, as a police officer? Yeah, I do. And just the biggest regret is having to put my boys through that. So... So, what's up with the club? It's on hold... for now, Because? Well, for now because I'm trying to help my mom out. And then I'm trying to fix my relationship with my dad. We clash a lot. There's not the best connection there, so... I'm trying to fix that. Is he still in Juarez, or... Yeah, he can come over here. The thing is I was still small, and my dad decided to try and cross drugs over here. He already had like a very good job, paying job, but for some reason he wanted more. He kind of got greedy. And then he was at the point that he wanted more, and more, and more, and more. So, he thought the easy way was to move drugs from Juarez to over here. So, he got arrested? Mm-hm, he got arrested, and the processing... I think it was in for a couple... like, half a year, like almost a year. And then they told him that he can stay, still, in the United States, but he couldn't go anywhere. Like, get out of the state, get out of the city. And the first thing he did, he went to Juarez. And he never came back. You kind of had told me little pieces here and there. Remember what I told you guys that I was very interested and that I was really going to help you and try to help you and motivate you guys to stick to your goals? And your goal was to be in law enforcement. - Mmm. - Right? And, I know that your relationship with your dad is extremely important. It is, but... I don't see why you can't do both. I don't see how cutting something that's very important to you is going to help the situation with your dad, or help you, or how that's going to benefit. - I understand. - I think it's going to hurt you. Yeah, I understand that it's going to hurt me, like, I even took that into consideration, but... I, like, I really want to fix what's going on. I know. Because of their circumstances at home, they end up putting their career, their education, their personal goals aside to help the family unit, which is sometimes frustrating. You know, as a teacher, you see the potential in them when you want them to do, you know, so well and they have the potential, but it's just the circumstances that they're surrounded in that life happens. Put your hands and chest on the wall! Spread your feet! One... two... three. Drug raid. Who's nine o'clock drug raid? -Get close! Get close! -Huddle, huddle. Huddle, huddle. Real quick prayer. Alright. Heavenly Father, thank you very much for bringing these beautiful kids together, allowing us the time and patience and all the love that we can give. We appreciate all You've done for us. I just ask You, Lord, to please protect each one of them. Let them have fun. Don't let them get stressed. Let it be one of the greatest moments that they always remember. We thank You for all in all Your name, amen. - Let's go. - Amen. "Scorpions" on three. One, two, three! Scorpions! Here's the search warrant. If something is highlighted in green, then you need to pay attention to it. - So, no-knock. - Okay. Bad guy number one has a history of armed robbery, domestic violence and drug use. Bad guy number two has a narcotics arrest only. Who's your team leaders? Alright. - Alright? - Yes, sir. - Let her go in first. - Sorry. - Go in first. - Go, go, go. It's a no-knock, it's a no-knock. Police, search warrant. Let me see your hands! Police, search warrant. Let me see your hands! - Cover. - Post. Police search warrant. Let's go in. Checking, checking, checking. - Clear. - Clear. Do you have a weapon? Turn around, turn around, sir. Turn around. -What the fuck is going on? -Turn around. Sir, I need you to be quiet. Sir, I need you to be quiet. Guys, put your gloves on. Put on your gloves and start searching. What's your badge number? What's your name and what's your badge number? Sir, sir, I need you to calm down. We've been brought in by a judge to come in. That's what we're just doing. I'm the lead detective. You have the right to remain silent. Anything that you say can and will be held against you in a court of law, sir. Sir, sir, pay attention. Left, right, what are we doing? - Stay like that. - Okay. What do we have here? So... Here, look. -Alright, Danny. -So, what have you determined? -Marijuana and... -We got a little baggie. Did you test them? Yeah, we tested them. Okay, so then, the two girls are being charged for possession. The guy... bad guy number three. What do I do? What do I say? Alright, so four of you are being arrested for being affiliated with what we have found. These two women... Wait, hold on, sir. These two women, bad guy number one and bad guy number two, you're being arrested for possession of illegal substances. And that is all that we have right now. What am I being arrested for? You're being arrested for being affiliated with what's going on here. Good job, guys. We'll fill out the critique and let them know how you guys did. Thank you. - Thank you. - Have a good day. You guys look happy. Yay. We fucking kicked ass, is what we did. We fucking kicked ass. Oy, it was great. Dynamic entry, staying out of the fatal funnel. What you say? - They came in and flowed. - Dynamic. They posted. The only thing was one guy went into this room by himself, called it clear. Came back out. Then two other people went in and found her in the closet. It's either one and a half or two. No, I thought it was better than that. They missed her. Yeah, they initially missed her, but they went back. The entry as a whole... That was a 105? Zero to three. Active shooter needs to happen now. Come over here. Alright. Before I even begin, I have too many members. Cassandra, I'm going to sit you out this one. Yes, sir. And I could tell you this, that that we need to slow down. If you guys mess up, that's okay. Just keep proper distances, alright? Is that cool? - Yes, sir. - Alright. Thank you. Thank you for being a good sport. I'm not sure why he chose me to be the one to leave. He just said, okay. I only need ten. I'm not going to have an odd number. I felt like I was missing out on what would happen inside when they all came out happy. I was like, damn, I could have been a part of that. He was someone that I looked up to since freshman year. He was the reason that I got into law enforcement and to just have that all fall down really hurt me. And in first place, Porter! Being alone for a long time messes with the way one thinks and the way one feels. I don't tell people my emotion. I don't let people in when something's hurting me. I don't reach out for help when things happen. People, I'm real proud of you, seriously. You guys definitely have what it takes to go to that next level. You guys are all law enforcement material in my book. Congratulations, guys. I found a support system so that I can have a family when my own family isn't here, so I don't feel alone. But it's not a support system for who I am. Well, first of all, congratulations to the Class of 2019. Cassandra Garcia. -Thank you. -Welcome. Cesar Emiliano Avila. Bring it in, bring it in. Congratulations, Scorpions. I'm going to college in San Antonio. It's taking a step back from this support system to get into a different one that actually accepts me and loves me for who I am. It says you have a match in your heart. I'll always. And you are never going to be by yourself, okay? Yeah, I know. You know that you can always come back. You know where to find me. Going to college in San Antonio, it's better than what I expected. The world is, like, free, I guess. Like, you can do whatever you want. You can say whatever you want. It's important to fight for issues when they haven't been won yet. Especially like women's rights, Chicano rights... LGBTQ rights. Native American rights, things like that. Native American rights, Dreamers' rights. I've always known that police brutality was a thing. I've always supported Black Lives Matter. I just never let it be known. I wasn't able to dress the way I wanted or, like, be who I am. Good job. Right now, I'm still trying to go for Border Patrol. But I'm still kind of deciding. I still want to be that, like, important person in my community. You know, like, I still want to feel like that I did it, you know. This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like. Law enforcement, that's not a part of my life anymore. I was very set on criminal justice and set on school, focusing on things, so I didn't have to focus on home. I've allowed myself to believe in myself. I guess my biggest fear is not making them proud. Knowing that he's always worked so hard, and I feel like I need to pay that back. Let me introduce myself. My name is Mason, and this is my channel. Basically, I made this channel, just so I could, you know, let myself talk about things. What I'm trying to say is, I'm trans. This is my new channel, because this is the new me. Peace.
