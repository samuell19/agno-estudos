Vesikalı yarim: My Beloved Who Is A Registered Hostess He shouldn't interfere, that's the truth. Everyone ought to quarrel in his own shop. Everyone should pay after the sale. That's right, let's not accept advance payment. In that case we'll butter it up a bit. He is crazy about it too, brags a lot. - Come on, stop it - Alright. Hossa! - Tonight we'll see you at the bar, Fethi? - Sure, it'll all be on me. We'll pay our debts, don't worry. If you go on spoiling it, I won't touch a drop of the drinks. A large bottle, and the snacks are on me too. There won't be any limit. That'll be more than enough anyway I'll treat you in Beyoglu. I'm fed up with Ali Rifat's place! It'll be more expensive, but it'll be a feast for our eyes I'll be there, my friend. So that's agreed Alright. We'll meet at the café at six and we'll leave from there - Let's make it seven. - Alright, brother. Don't be late, we want to start our fun in time. - I'm going to the prayers, son. - I'll come too, father. - A good day, Halil efendi. - How can I help you, auntie? - How much are they? - We sell them for 35. Still... they didn't come don't this year. My daughter-in-law said ten, but five will be enough. - That one's from me, for the grandchild. - But you can't do this every time, boy! - May God grant you plenty. Greetings to Murat. - I will. - Shall we go in here? - It's up to you. So what, let's go in! They won't let us in here! Let's go to Taksim, there are better quality bars. Once I used to go there a lot I know the waiters, they'll take special care of us. Like a crystal clear spring... They said this place was swell, let's go in, kids! Like a crystal clear spring, your brown eyes. It gives joy to my soul, your brown eyes. Welcome, my friends. Please, sit down. What can I get you? Bring us a big bottle of new Raki. And appetizers, afterwards, some hot food With pleasure. May you enjoy yourselves. I'm Cemile. Don't spoil it at once, my lion! I'll take a cigarette. With her charms and songs, she'll try to fool us... ...good riddance... - Every drink costs 30 lira. - No! Yes! What did you expect? Bargain prices? - Your health. - Amen, everyone's. He plays like running water, he binds me to you, Tell my, why does he cry? Your brown eyes, my beloved, your eyes... - Come on. - To good talking. To your health. May roses end, wherever you go, May the nightingale sing on a branch It was a good thing you suggested Beyoglu. It means a man needs something like this sometimes. Of course, my brave. What else? With the money Ali Rifat gave us we too could open a bar. We could have opened one a long time ago. We just go on from one place to another... A young man must walk every road, pass every river... - I brought this for you, my brothers. - Long may you live. You're welcome, may it be tasty. I'm in the back street, at 4 o'clock in the morning. The hands in deep sleep, I'm in your sorrow The hands in sweet sleep... The time passes quickly, but, so what, let's enjoy ourselves! Have another one. They are poor girls, what the hell... ...by their looks even the mirrors get moldy! There are some who know all kinds of conversations. They make men their slaves. I've been beaten, insulted, knifed... ...on top of it they eat up your money, and still they aren't satisfied! Cemil, you know everything! Drink makes you loosen your tongue! I just know. Once they get hold of a guy, especially a guy they've made drunk of, they even raze mountains, I tell you! Stop it! Save it for some other night. - Cemil is right. - What do you know?! I had a friend in the army. That friend couldn't stand the longing, he moved to a near town and rented a house I learned it all from him When's she's finished her song, let's send her something to drink. It's just talk, sonny, otherwise you'll know your friend. What was that? Let us hear too! Ha? Feel at ease. We'll leave soon. We didn't say anything of importance, don't get angry. - Won't you come? - Aaa... We won't leave you here! Don't waste your time, it'll spoil your appetite, off you go... What about you? I'll have one or two drinks, then I'll go home There are all kinds of temptations. Thousands of different kinds of women, they fill the place up good! Let's leave. Halil is no stranger, and we're free men. This is for the first bottle and the appetizers. - We'll pay our share tomorrow. - Alright. In the back street, next to our home. Let's reconcile, my darling, against friend and enemy Let's reconcile, my darling, against friend or enemy Because of you, my sorrow never ends Because of you, my sorrow never ends I've given my life for my love for my love... ...because of you... May I have a cigarette? Can you give me a light? What do you want? Buy me a drink. Bring her whatever she wants. And clean up the table. - Cognac, no water or ice. Your health. Let's wait for your drink. I'm called, excuse me. To your eyebrows, your eyes, your tongues, your beauty, girls! Your health! We have to get up early tomorrow, I wish we didn't have to leave. And me who thought we were going some place... But there'll be another evening, my eyes' delight! We'll go another evening. Necmi will come too... He'll lose his direction for 10 hours. Let's call it a night, I say... If you'll excuse us... our boss will be angry if we're late for the job. Good night, Fahri bey. I hope we'll see you again soon... - No trouble, thank you... - Good night... my respects, gentlemen. - No tip for me? - Yours? Did I ever leave you without a tip? You're my sweetheart! Look, I haven't forgotten you either. Good night. - See you, girls. - Goodbye. We'll be here again in two days. Take care. Are you still here? I forgot, forgive me. - Bring me another cognac. - But we're closing.. Bring it, I said! Very well. Thank you, sir. I'd like to have a drink too. Do you know a place that's still open? At this hour the night clubs and cabarets are opening up. Those places are for entertainment. I meant a place for drinking. - Too early to go to sleep... - But it's midnight! Oh well... I slept all night. When I drink, I like entertainment. Of course, I mustn't drink too much. I've been stood up tonight! It just happens sometimes. That's your problem. No longer interested? - In what? - In drinking. I don't know. Should go. If there's no joint on the way, I won't look for one Let's go together. Where? As if there were no joints at all! Don't pretend you don't know! I wouldn't ask if I did know. Let's leave separately. Wait for me at the corner. Otherwise they'll imagine something else. They'd try to rob you of several hundred lira. I'd pay if I had to. - Not a bad idea to come here, was it? - You can say that again! Don't look at me, look at her! To Hamalba?I. - Where do you live? - Koca Mustafa Pa?a. Oh! that's near by! It's far off, yes. And the bridge hasn't opened yet. You'll sleep in the car. I won't. I feel great. I haven't had such a good time in ages. - Haven't you enjoyed yourself! - How so? You didn't laugh, not even talked openly. You haven't even told me your name. My name's Halil. Is that so? Where are you from? From Istanbul. I was born here and grew up here. I am very pleased to have made your acquaintance. My name's Sabiha. I wish you a pleasant morning! Halil! Come and stay with me, till the bridge is closed. Do you anything to drink? Wanna drink more? Maybe I won't, but give me one! - Whose picture is this? - Hm? My mother's, she's dead. Who else is there, no family? Off we go! Do you want me to tell you my life story, sweety? Do you want to hear how I came to fall so deep? No, I don't. Oh my, oh my... what shall we do now? Is Sabiha your real name? No, it's fake! Had it been fake, do you imagine I'd have chosen Sabiha? You've taken off your makeup... Why shouldn't I?! I can't go to bed like that, can I? You even took off your earrings. Ah... I'm tired. You too lie down. It's a pity, your smell's gone too! Your perfume. You like perfumed and painted women? I've never met adorned and perfumed women. And I haven't drunk at this hour. Except on friends' wedding feasts. What is your job? I'm a fruit-seller. We have our own orchard. You look as if butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, or are you really that innocent? Once I worked as a driver too. We still have our car. - First time you visited our bar? - First. - I generally don't go to such places. - Don't come again. Once you get the taste for drinking, entertainment, once you're hooked... Don't worry about me. - Peace be with you. - And with you. How quickly noon came... - Aren't you coming? - I'll come later. Hello, Halil. - Welcome. - Give me one kilo of apples. That's 2 liras, isn't it? - Anything else? - I gave you 5 liras. My change? Excuse me, I was dreaming. No problem. - Have a nice day. - Thanks. Oh, hello, sir. Last night we went up in smoke, really. I've only slept two hours. You should have come to! So you've enjoyed yourselves. Ah, the women were worth the price. Especially mine was. The way she sang and belly danced... Next week we'll go again, I'm telling you. - You can go on your own. - We won't go anywhere without you! Alright. I'll come along later. See you. You're not very tall, and you have a bad temper. You're not very tall, and you have a bad temper. You cheat on me, you naughty one. You cheat on me, you naughty one. We went to the Tabarin bar... Afterwards, he went to sleep at our place. Look after that table! In the living room. Separately, you say... I say... At one moment I thought I'd change my mind, but he left He wanted it, fearful and proud all together. Another man, after spending so much money, would have... I was astonished at it too! Who knows what his intentions are? The man was not stupid! No, not at all... Listen... Once you get used to him he's even handsome. They're inviting you. I don't care. I won't sit with them, even if they begged. If I were as beautiful as you, I wouldn't either. Hello. I brought this for you. What's this? Good heavens, what a present! Long live our uncle. You talk about a fruit-seller, he brings fruit! He surely brought us no car! I could die laughing. My mistake. Look here. Send them to all tables, they're from me. Take them! Welcome, sir, sit down. Very well. - A small bottle. And appetizers. - Yes, sir. Anything else? That's enough for now. Coming, sir You cheat on my, you naughty one. You cheat on my, you naughty one. My little darling, my naughty darling My little darling... Look here... Take this and bring me some almonds, and ice, and Birinci cigarettes. Yes, sir. - Where are you going? - I'll be back soon. She'll be back. Here you are, sir. - Keep the change. - Thank you, sir. We put the sheep's head into the oven, it was only half cooked I told you to salt it properly, it was only half cooked Forgive me. - For what I did a few minutes ago. - There's nothing to forgive. I didn't want to make fun of you. I just didn't know what to think. I didn't know what to think either. Since last night. - What do you want? - It's obvious: I like you. It's even worse than that! - You said you wouldn't come again. - That's what I said. - Whom do I give the money? - What money? That's you said... That if I wanted to, I'd have to pay... Out of the question! I won't come. I'll never come to you that way! We'll go to the Bosporus, we'll have fun sitting at the seaside, in our palace... ...later we'll listen to the nightingale. Who ever heard of nightingales in winter?! Listen to those drunks! - Won't stay till morning. At most one hour - Sure, sweetheart. After I've left, you'll do something naughty! I won't. It'll be like you say, but let's go. Halil! Here's your light tea. - Nice to see you again, it's been some time. - So it was. - From work. - Bye. When will you send the wares? Send your men to the shop. If I'm not there, my father will take them. - A good day. - To you too. - Hello. - Yes, please? You're late. The boss is worried. I've come to fetch you. I won't come. Why? Has something happened? No... Take your coat, I'll call a taxi. I said I won't come! I'm ill, I got a cold. - You're not. - Tell them I'm sick. Say hello to everybody. Eat it while it's hot; let's see if you like it. Who was it? They were worried at the bar, they sent a man. I told him I wouldn't come. - Who knows till when? - Never again, never! Is that understood? - To you, Halil. - To you, Sabiha. Do you feel good? Like a sultan. I couldn't feel any better. What about you? As you can see. I've always wanted to live that way. You were my fate, today was my fate. It's gone cold, and you didn't taste it! We have this one too, but it's more expensive. - I want it brilliant, sparkling! - This stone comes from Europe. The real stone is worth 2.000 lira. Put it in a velvet box. There is no extra charge for the package. My love for you, My love... ...there is no hope, you wouldn't know. As much as I love you, Ah... You can not love me... You can not love me. As much as I love you, Ah... You can not love me. You can not love me. For a romantic adventure... For a romantic adventure... You can not... ...be led into sorrow For a romantic adventure... You cannot be led into sorrow But this is madness! I won't say anything against a little fun, but I can't stand stupidity! Go out with your Halil now and then, stay with him but don't live with him! Now is your time to earn money and to save a lot. You can have a job in any bar you want, ask for any fee. I'll need some more sets of underwear. He came as he was, without anything. The boss told me what happened, but I wouldn't believe it. He was astonished too The shirt will get burned! At least, had you done this with someone rich! Had emptied the guy's pockets, I wouldn't have been so angry. What a lousy fellow, he really has no clue whatsoever! Have you finished? Can I ever finish while you're with that guy?! I wish you'll have a Halil, too. Thank God I ain't lost my mind! I'm saving some money. I just bought seven carpets. We need brains, not romance! Had we brains, would we work? Does this kind of life have an end? Saving money for a shop, that's a long way! At 2 o'clock in the morning... and your name will be dragged in the mud... Marriage, a child... Bravo, your Halil taught you some nice words! So what? It's true. It's true, but for that you need to save money. I'm wasting my breath! You should have had a cup of coffee. Another time. I'll drop by again anyway. See you, sweetheart. - Just the two of us will eat all that?! - Sure. It'll take years! We'll eat that in no time. It's nothing. I've learned this from my father. He buys his food wholesale. Does he know? - Won't he be worried? - How old am I? Let's see how old you are in your father's eyes... I bought some linden tree blossoms. You'll brew some now and then, won't you? I will. Halil... It's only now that I love this flat... Before... I don't know... it was just a shelter. Now it's a home. Sabiha... - Yes? What's the matter? They won't leave you alone! They have their reasons too... Everyone has in this business. Don't even think about it! It's still early, but I began feeling sleepy. You haven't drunk tonight... Because I hadn't to... But if you had drunk, I wouldn't have let you drink alone. Fresh mackerel, fresh bonito... Mirrors, lighters, pens, it's free to have a look, plates... Ah, sister, let me give you something nice, and a piece for our brother-in-law too... ...for instance, these prayer beads. If you like them, you can have them very cheap. Take them, aren't they nice? Then we have this. different kinds of pens... Look at that case... - I haven't been here before. - Me neither. Wherever we go, whatever we do, for me it's always the first time. Do I make you happy? I don't know... sometimes you seem far away, as if your mind were somewhere else. Never! Won't you come to bed? You don't answer... You don't go to work anymore... You're used to working. Don't you find it hard to just sit around like that? And... You won't say anything about your money being spent... Because we have money, thank God! I beg you, Halil, don't be angry, don't spoil it! What do we care about your money?! I knew you were going to say that. - D'you want a shop? - No. I heard you've left your father. So it's true... I've asked him the other day... What did he say? He mumbled something like: "What an idea!? Out of the question!" We haven't separated, true. We'll open another shop in Beyoglu. We are in preparation for now. That should do for today. Did you, at least, find a good shop? I did. Amasya apples... Fresh salads... Fresh fish... I'll call it a day. Shall I polish two for you here? I won't do this in the bar. Bon appetit. - See you. - Bye. Give me 15 lemons, brother. You're the one living with Sabiha, aren't you? Who do you think you are, bastard?! You've threatened the girl so that she stays with you! If she doesn't come to the bar tonight, I'll kill you! Is that understood? You're wrong! Don't, brother, you'll kill him! Tell us when he comes, and make sure he calls the police station! They said that Halil did it? He beat both of them up really bad, because of you! The boss didn't want any scandal in the district, so he just warned everybody. But it there's any more trouble, you'll get to know his other side! You're late. The sale went well, I couldn't leave earlier. You did well. You've caught a cold... It was cold... Halil... Sabiha... Sabiha... Hello. - Hello. - What happened last evening? - Nothing, just a quarrel. - Bad luck, eh? Not worth mentioning. - I gave a deposition at the police station - Any penalty? No. The superintendent gave me an admonishment. He behaved like a father. What was the fight about? Innocent heart, innocent soul. Fill it up, give it to me. Fill it up, give it to me. Innocent heart... He really caused his father a lot of pain... ...but he won't say anything. That's what he's like anyway, he rarely talks. Whoever becomes Sabiha's slave, he won't get very far... I don't understand how could she fall for Halil... What about Halil? He never leaves the quarter. He was like a big brother to everyone... He didn't even look up when he served women or girls. You come with us, you too get involved with women. Don't get me wrong, we're just talking... I'm so confused I no longer know what to say. Forget it! I understand. Doesn't he think about his wife, his children? He's married?! On top of everything he's married?! If he were married, he would have told me. - He has two children too. - You're lying! You didn't like him from the start. You've made up that lie among yourselves Thinking I'd believe such a thing! If you don't believe it, just ask your Halil. If he's a man, he'll tell you. How can I ask him? How can I make him that angry? What if he asks me: "how could you believe it?" We'll see about that, just look into his eyes. Everyone will tell you if you ask about his shop, his home! Got it, sweety? What did you leave me, except a memory? I won't come back, You've betrayed our love. You broke my heart, You didn't leave a memory. You liar, look for Your sin on your lips Look for them on your lips. - I didn't hear you. - What's there to eat? - What you asked me to. - I'm very hungry. I won't be here tomorrow afternoon... One of my friends from the bar is getting married. - I'll go to the wedding. - Sure. Will that do? I wouldn't know... you know better. Isn't it a bit too revealing? They printed no invitations. She invited me herself. May they be happy. - Will you come too? - I can't. I have to work. - Marriage must be a fine thing, isn't it? - Must be, for sure. People must love one another, understand one another. Would you want to...? With you? No! I didn't mean myself. I meant marriage in general. How could I not want it, being with you! A drink?! At midnight?! You too can't sleep, Halil. What's troubling you? What could? Maybe you want to tell me something? What'd that be? I don't know. - Maybe there's something. - If there was something, I'd tell you. Would you tell me? Look after my stalls. - What're you doing here? - What's it to you?! - Were you going to buy something? - I wasn't! - I thought you were going to come see me. - No. - Why did you leave without talking to me? - I felt like it. Sabiha, what's the matter? Is there a problem? There's no problem. Or is there a problem? There isn't. There shouldn't be! I don't know... you've become so strange all of a sudden! I have? You go out without telling me, you walk around like a tramp, you talk back. What's the matter? - It means what it means! - Sabiha! You're hurting me! Tell me! You tell me, maybe you have something to tell! What can I say? - It's you who are strange, not me. - So you've understood. And if you have, maybe you'll understand something else too... What else? Or? Alright, Halil. I can't go on like that... Always lying awake, thinking, it'll kill me! But why? If you don't want to go on, tell me right out. You've got bored, is that it? Maybe... maybe you too will one day leave me and go. You'll long for your shop, your home. My home, my shop will always be here. I have no other place to go! My shop:... 2 orange boxes. My home:... near you. Don't you have anything else to say? Then, I have nothing else to say either. Not now, not ever! - Sabiha! Don't drive me mad! I'm not used to be treated with contempt... ...especially in the street... and with you! What do you want? Shall I kneel here? To drag you by your hair? Do what you want! But it's best we finished it right here, right now! - Better that to suffer later... - Why suffer? - You know it very well! - Sabiha... No! Don't say anything! It'd be best if you left! If I didn't see you any more... If I didn't hear you any more. Go away, Halil! I've sold seven lemons and ten oranges. Here you are. - Thanks. - Where've you disappearedall at once? Should've done that a long time ago. You're crazy, crazy! You should have slapped him! You can't just be silent... "You're married, married!", you should have said. - I couldn't. - Why couldn't you? What are you afraid of? - What if he had said "yes, I'm married"? - Admits or denies it, it's the same thing! Isn't he married? Maybe his friends have invented it... Oh... now you're really too much, you won't see what's right before your eyes You'd better go and lie down at his feet Go to him! Nothing will happen stayinging with me. I can't If I saw him... in the same room with him! How many days have I looked at his face... ...always deep in thought... ...about selling lemons and oranges, about being happy with me, staying with me. And always, on the tip of my tongue: "Are you married?" Then he'd look up at me as if I said something, "Did you say something?" he'd ask... Right then, I'm so afraid I can't move! What if I asked... what if he told me: "I'm married". What if he says: "Why do you ask? Don't you trust me?" What if he gets angry... I just don't know... I don't know! Look at me. Calm yourself. Tomorrow morning you'll leave very early, you'll go to his shop, to his house. You'll see with your own eyes, and then you'll be calm. Don't you have even that much courage? You find something valuable, and when you do, you regret it! You don't know where to put it, don't you? Like a stone! Off you go! Tell your mother Granddad will come home early and will bring some meat. Can I help you? I... one kilo apples. How is Halil? It won't do you any good. Who ever heard of separating for no reason at all? It happened to me. Don't take it so serious. Don't wreck your home because of your pride. Shut up! Don't meddle in my affairs! You're sad, of course... - You're a wreck. - This is the hardest. Go home as if nothing happended, sit down at the dinner table, then in a convenient moment, ask: "what's the news?", that's all there is to it. Well? Your health Sabiha. Welcome. Cheers, darling I won't complain to anybody, I'll cry about my fate Are you taking my picture, or what? I'm trembling like a criminal, when contemplating my future Enough with that look, get lost! I'm fed up! I've had my fun. It's over and gone! Don't hang around my skirts any longer. Understood? Did he annoy you? He was my lover, my friend, my husband. You've put the guy in his place. So what, he's gone now... And he won't be back again. Yes, he won't come again. He's left... he won't call again... he won't ask for me! He took me out of his life! Calm yourself, girl. Have fun, we'll take care of you! Let go off me! Haven't we struck a deal just now?! We've even given you a raise. Haven't I given you an advance for 10 days? Halil! Halil! Halil. "I can't be your lover..." "It's better to separate without quarrel, without seeing each other." "You still have time to return to your own road, and so have I." "I wish you luck with your work too." What did you leave me, except a memory? I won't come back To the love you've betrayed. You've broken my heart, Didn't leave a memory. Look for your sins on your lips, you liar. Look for them on your lips. Can I help you, sir? - Is she here? - I swear, she isn't here. Please, look around. Sabiha won't come here again. She's fleeing from you. Look for her at Despina's place if you like. It's a quiet bar. Of course, you won't mention my name... And don't let them know you're looking for Sabiha! - Is there another man? - I don't know. Another friend, playmate? - I don't know. - You know. - Did someone else turn up? - I don't know. Ask her yourself. I won't. What if she said: "There is another one"? Don't you overdo it, friend. In this world, all kinds of things happen. You too will find another. You'll say "Good riddance" and walk on. - If you want I'll talk to Sabiha. - No! I shouldn't have come here. Very well. I'm off, sweety. I'm late already Look here! You've smelled her out, haven't you? And we have unfinished business, too. You did right to come here. Leave! Can't you read? Get lost! Stay here. You've worn out my patience! Halil! All this because of me! Either you'll die or you'll kill Why have you come? You shouldn't have come! You knew I would come. - What do you want? - I don't know. Maybe I've had enough, maybe I'm bored! We should both go our own ways. - Our ways? - Yes. - I thought they were the same. - No, they're not the same. My way is different. I've finally understood that after meeting you. After being with you... Love is not enough... we should have met a long time ago. Sabiha. Anyway, our ways will separate. They'll catch you. He won't die... Hy knife hit his ribs. I won't stay in prison long, don't worry. If you're in my life, I won't feel imprisoned. You'll visit me. I'll see you lots of times. After my release we'll move to another quarter, or even to another town. Is that what you think? Is it that easy? They won't leave you alone while I'm inside. Oh God! I won't see anybody, I'll wait for you. You will? The guy's lost a lot of blood, they barely could save him! Your lover will go to prison for at least a year. He'll surely repent. Wise up! Don't get mixed up in such things. You'll lose your reputation. You won't find work anywhere I won't work anyway... I won't work. You're not yourself now. You barely got out of it. Relax for a few days. I'm retiring. Don't count on me any longer. I'll see neither you, nor Halil. Tell me if you need something. If you feel bored at night, drop by. I hope you'll recover soon. Sit down, have a drink. You know I never drink before work. Come on, get dressed, we'll go together. I bought some underwear, cigarettes, food. You'll take it to him tomorrow. Don't think I'm drinking all the time. Only now and then. My whole body aches. My hands, my breasts, my knees, even my eyes burn. At such times, one or two glasses do me good. If you love him that much, go and visit him. In any case, he wouldn't have done me any good. One day he would have left me for his family. If I had to deal with another woman it would be easier. I'd make an effort, try to cope, but... I can't cope with a family, with children. I've learned that from my father. It'll pass, you'll see. Had I found such a love, do you imagine I'd stay? If he asks about me, tell him: "She's fine." "She sends you her greetings..." Tahsin. Take it. - What is it? - Open it, you'll see. She says: "he's married, I can't cope with this". At the same time, she sends me to that Halil! She's hooked to the guy, it's not easy to get free. If she gives that guy false hopes, she'll drive him completely crazy! "You didn't come, you didn't call... no letter, no news from you. Was that your message, Sabiha? Was that our agreement? Of course, the days and months pass." He'll be released today. In that case, he'll come to you tonight. He won't come! We're through. For months I haven't answered his letters. He surely has forgotten me too. If he forgot you like you did... if this means forgetting... It would have been better if you had visited him in prison. Now Halil will be even more furious. He'll knock on your door tonight. He won't come, and, if he does, I won't be here. - I'll work again. - What will you do? I'm serious. So what! For months I've had no fun! I'll take dancing lessons. I'll perform in the big nightclubs. I'm more beautiful and sexy than all the girls working there. I'll have my hair done, I'll dress up, I'll show them the alluring Sabiha After being idle all this time, why wait for the day of his release? It'll turn out the way you said, he'll try to come to me. If he finds me working, that'll end his hopes for ever. Don't mention old times. We'll behave as if he left only yesterday. We'll take him straight home. His father is waiting for him. He didn't come out of stubbornness. Not once did he visit him! Not out of stubbornness. Had he come here, he would've wanted to slap his son. Well done, old man! Halil, come here, brother. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Are you well? - Thank God. What about you? The car's waiting. You go. I'll come later. We won't let you go. You took the trouble to come. I thank you My life passes by, again... I'm in a thousand sorrows You've come again! I don't want any trouble. Otherwise it'll end badly! - Welcome. Congratulations on your release. - Thanks. Let's sit down and have a drink. Tell me your troubles, Let me know your sorrow. Let me say hello to Sabiha first. She's with a customer. There's no harm in saying hello, is it? Hello, Sabiha. Oh, hello Halil... I've known Halil bey for a long time... Because of me he knifed a man and went to prison. He's just been released... While in prison, he must have forgotten all about it. Isn't that so, Halil? Isn't it? Halil... My Halil! Call the police! Catch him! - Bastard! - Don't come near me! There he is, sir! He pulled the knife! We all saw it. I did it! It was my knife! She's lying! We all saw he knifed her. He falsely accuses him! Everybody here hates Halil! I've knifed myself. My hand slipped... ...an accident... Nobody leaves! If necessary, I'll take you all to the police station. That goes for you too Now I'm done for! What have you left me, Except a memory, I won't come back To your cheating love You've broken my heart, You only left a memory Look for your sins... On your lips, you liar You're crying in vain, I won't follow you around any longer May your heart burn too, Now it's my turn. You've broken my heart, You only left a memory Look for your sins... ...on your lips, you liar Mother, father has come! He stroke me on my head. Will he stay? Are you hungry? What a fool I was! I've always sought my misfortune. I love Halil. And he loves me, isn't it true? - If he didn't, he wouldn't have come. - That's true. He loves me. That's why he knifed me. I was the reason for his going to prison, for his suffering, for our separation. Finally, I can see clear. I'll go straight to him, I'll fall down on my knees "My Halil" I'll say. You're looking well. So do you. I thank you. If you'll go to the orchard, the cart's ready. I'll go, mother. My son! Go... Go! You clear up the flat, set the table, everything's in the kitchen. If I were in your place I would go, girl. I'll go! When he sees, me he'll come. He'll leave everything and come. Since he loves me... since I cannot do without him.. Since I'll die without him! Don't cry in vain, Don't come running after me any longer. May your heart burn too, Now it's my turn. You broke my heart, You only left a memory. Your cheating sins, Look for them on your lips. You broke my heart, You only left a memory. Your cheating sins, Look for them on your lips.
