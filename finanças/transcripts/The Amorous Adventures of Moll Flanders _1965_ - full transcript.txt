MY YEARS IN THIS HOUSE WERE EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY. ALTHOUGH ONLY A SERVANT, I WAS TREATED AS ONE OF THE FAMILY, AND, LIKE ITS OTHER MEMBERS, I'VE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW MY STUDIES AND KEEP MYSELF SPOTLESSLY TIDY...TOO. IN OTHER WORDS, MY EDUCATION WAS IN NO WAY NEGLECTED. OH, SIR, WHAT A FRIGHT YOU GAVE ME. OH, SIR. OH, NO, SIR. OH, SIR, WHAT WILL YOUR FATHER SAY?

I SPENT WHOLE HOURS LOOKING AT THE GOLD HE HAD GIVEN ME. I COUNTED HIS COINS A HUNDRED TIMES A DAY. RUIN WAS AT MY DOOR. BUT I THINK I NOW RATHER WISHED FOR THAT RUIN THAN STUDIED HOW TO AVOID IT. GOODBYE, BROTHER. GOODBYE, DEAR. SIR. HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE? A WEEK. OR A MONTH IF THE PLEASURES OF TOWN ARE DIVERTING. OH. AW... THERE NOW, MOLL. [FLUTE PLAYS] WHAT DO YOU SEE? SOMETHING IN THE WATER. A CORPSE? I'VE KNOWN GOOD PICKINGS OFF DROWNED MEN. A LASS, BY HER LONG HAIR. UNLESS IT'S SOME FOOL GENTLEMAN BATHING IN HIS WIG. IS THAT A SHEEP OR A PILE OF CLOTHES? LET'S HOPE IT'S A MAN AND HE'S BROUGHT HIS WATCH AND PURSE. COME ON. HELP YOURSELF, SQUINT. NO, NOT A FARTHING. THERE'S A BIT OF LACE HERE, THOUGH. I SEE YOU! VILLAINS! OHH, I SEE YOU! WRETCHES! HELP! HELP! HELP! OOH, YOU! VILLAINS! M-M-M-MISS FLANDERS. I WANTED FOR A LONG TIME TO GET YOU... ON YOUR OWN. I'D LIKE VERY MUCH TO-- OOH! LIKE VERY MUCH TO TALK TO YOU, IF I MAY, PLEASE. M-M-M-MISS FLANDERS, I-I-I'VE NEVER CALLED YOU M-M-MOLL AS THE OTHERS HAVE DONE, BECAUSE, IN BRIEF, I'VE, WELL, I'VE NEVER TREATED YOU AS A SERVANT IN THIS HOUSEHOLD, BECAUSE, IN SHORT, YOU'VE ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TO BE MORE OF AN EQUAL A-A-AND, IN MANY CASES, A...A SUP-- A SUPERIOR. I--I--I HAVE MOVED, AS YOU KNOW-- I HAVE MOVED, AS YOU KNOW, IN OUR OWN LOCAL SOCIETY-- IN OUR LOCAL SOCIETY, AND I'VE NEVER FOUND A YOUNG WOMAN TO COMPARE WITH YOU FOR YOUR--YOUR LOOKS, YOUR GOOD HUMOR, OR YOUR WIT. IN-N-N-N BRIEF, M-M-MISS FLANDERS, I'D LIKE VERY MUCH M-M-M-MARRY YOU. MARRY? ME? MARRY MOLL? NO! OHH! AND WHAT, PRAY, IS WRONG WITH MOLL? SHE'S AS GENTEEL AS ANY OF OUR ACQUAINTANCES! GENTEEL? SHE WAS DRAGGED UP BY GYPSIES. AND WHAT'S MORE, SHE'S A BASTARD! YES, AND SHE'S A JUMPED-UP SERVANT GIRL! BRED IN A POORHOUSE! AT LEAST SOMEONE'S ASKED FOR HER, WHICH IS MORE THAN ANYONE'S DONE FOR YOU! OHH! OHH! QUIET DOWN! QUIET! YOU, TOO! AAH! QUIET, ALL OF YOU! HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD! I DO, SIR! BY FINDING A WIFE WHO'LL PUT SOME GOOD LOOKS INTO THIS FAMILY! [COUGHING] MOLL? I MUST TALK WITH YOU. PLEASE TELL ME-- TELL ME WHAT TO DO, WHAT TO SAY. SAY TO WHO? HIM. HE. HE'S ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM. WHO? WHO? HE. YOUR BROTHER. AND HE'S TOLD THE WHOLE FAMILY. OH, THEY'LL MURDER ME FOR SURE. HA HA HA HA HA! HE'S A GOOD ENOUGH FELLOW AND WELL-PROVIDED. OR DO YOU LOOK HIGHER? HOW CAN I BE A WIFE TO ONE BROTHER AND A... A MISTRESS TO THE OTHER? MMM, IF YOU ARE ANXIOUS ON THAT SCORE, MOLL, I HAVE NO CLAIMS ON YOU. NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER THAN TO REGARD YOU AS A SISTER. IF YOU DON'T MARRY HIM, THEY'LL KICK YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE. AND WHAT WILL YOUR PROSPECTS BE THEN, A GIRL WHO'S LOST HER REPUTATION? WHO TOOK IT FROM ME? AND... YOU MAY BE WITH CHILD FOR ALL WE KNOW. YES, YOUR BEST COURSE IS TO MARRY MY BROTHER, JUST AS SOON AS YOU CAN GET HIM TO THE CHURCH. HIS WORDS HAD PUT IDEAS INTO MY HEAD, AND I FANCIED MYSELF WITH CHILD. A FEAR THAT LUCKILY PROVED FALSE. BUT BY THEN, TAKING THE ADVICE OF THE MAN WHOM I STILL LOVED, I'D SAID... I WILL. WHO GIVETH THIS WOMAN TO BE MARRIED TO THIS MAN? MODESTY FORBIDS ME TO REVEAL THE... SECRETS OF THE MARRIAGE BED. [SNORING] [SNORING] NEVER, LADIES, NEVER MARRY A FOOL. ANY HUSBAND RATHER THAN A FOOL. OHH! OH, YOU! WHETHER A MAD FOOL OR A SOBER FOOL, TAKE ANYTHING BUT A FOOL. HA HA HA HA! YAA-HAA! YAA! HYAH! AND THIS ONE CAME TO A FOOL'S END. I THANK YOU, VICAR. MY DEAR. DON'T CRY, MOTHER. PLEASE. THE FAMILY, OF COURSE, MADE SURE I GOT NOTHING BY HIS WILL. AND SO, NEXT MORNING EARLY, I LEFT THE HOUSE TO MAKE MY WAY IN THE WORLD. AND NOW I WAS FACED BY THE WORST OF DEVILS-- POVERTY. A GIRL CAN BE KEPT BY A MAN OR SHE CAN KEEP HERSELF, BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, EVEN WHEN INDEPENDENT, SHE IS STILL LOOKING FOR A KEEPER. AND, I CONFESS, I WAS NOT SUITABLY AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF MY HUSBAND. THOUGH A WIDOW, I FELT I SHOULD SOON BE A WIDOW CONSOLED. GOOD DAY, MA'AM. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP YOU? I, UH...I'VE COME ABOUT THE POSITION. OH, WELL, MISS GLOWBER'S IN THE FITTING ROOM. BELLA, BELLISSIMA! YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A SEAMSTRESS, CHILD. WITH THOSE LEGS, YOU CAN CLIMB HIGHER THAN NEEDLEWORK. I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE, SIR, OF ANYTHING BUT HOUSEHOLD DUTIES. AH, QUELLE CHANCE. MY WIFE IS LOOKING FOR A LADY'S MAID. LADY'S MAID, INDEED. HA! LADY BLYSTONE SHOULD WAIT FOR MAIDS UNTIL SHE CAN PAY HER BILLS. THIS ONE, SIR, HAS BEEN DUE TWO MONTHS! MY WIFE WILL SEND YOU THE MONEY AS SOON AS WE GET TO LONDON. I THINK, SIR, SHE IS NOT YOUR WIFE. I KNOW HER FOR THE DUKE OF ILCHESTER'S DAUGHTER, FROM A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE IN NOT PAYING DEBTS. OH, PER FAVORE, PLEASE. SOME PEOPLE COME TO THE COUNTRY FOR CREDIT WHEN THEY CAN NO LONGER OBTAIN IT IN TOWN. SEND IT TO MY BANKERS. IF YOU HAVE BANKERS, PERHAPS YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO SIGN IT AND ADDRESS IT. I UNDERSTAND, LADY BLYSTONE, YOU'RE IN NEED OF A MAID. IN NEED, MY DEAR, I CERTAINLY AM, BUT I'M ALSO IN NEED OF THE FUNDS TO PAY ONE. I WOULD COME TO YOU FOR NOTHING, JUST FOR MY KEEP. YOU'RE A WIDOW, MY DEAR? YES. OH, YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY. THANK YOU, BUT IT'S OUT OF PLACE. MY HUSBAND WAS A FOOL. I CANNOT CLAIM IT WAS ANY GREAT LOSS. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT WAGES I WANT BUT OPPORTUNITY. AND WHAT OPPORTUNITY DO YOU EXPECT IN LONDON? THE CHANCE OF ANOTHER HUSBAND. AND HOW DO YOU THINK OUR CITY MEN ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR RUSTIC VARIETY? I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE DIFFERENT, BUT THERE'S A WIDER CHOICE, MILADY. OF THE CLOTH AND COLOR OF THEIR CLOTHES PERHAPS, BUT NOT WHAT'S INSIDE. COULD YOU TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COUNTRY CLOD AND A COURTIER IN THE DARK? BUT I'D SOONER MARRY THE COURTIER, WOULDN'T YOU? AH, MARRIAGE, YES, THERE I AGREE. THE CLOTH COUNTS MORE THAN WHAT IT CONTAINS. YOU KNOW, YOU PLEASE ME, CHILD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ON BEFORE ME AND TAKE MY BAGGAGE TO LONDON? OH, MILADY. DARLING, I HAVE GOOD NEWS. WE HAVE A NEW MAID. OH, BELLA, BELLISSIMA. I SAID MAID. BUT, DARLING... R-O-T-H. H? H. ROTHCHILD. I WAS RESOLVED NOW TO BE MARRIED OR NOTHING AND TO BE WELL-MARRIED OR NOT AT ALL. I NOW HAD THE FIRST ESSENTIAL FOR A WOMAN WHO SEEKS A HUSBAND-- A GOOD WARDROBE. IT WASN'T MINE, OF COURSE, BUT I'D BORROWED SKILLFULLY. ALREADY IT SEEMED TO BE HAVING AN EFFECT. WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR? I SAY IT'S WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. INDEED, SIR? IN MY ESTIMATION, 'TIS SOMEWHAT COOLER. WELL, I'LL NOT DISPUTE THE TEMPERATURE, MA'AM, IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME TO OPEN THE WINDOW. I DO HOPE WE'LL DISPUTE NOTHING, SIR. WE'VE A LONG WAY TO GO. LONDON? MMM. HAVE YOU BEEN THERE BEFORE? NO. NEVER. I HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD FRIENDS THERE, MA'AM. 'TIS A CITY FULL OF SNARES AND PITFALLS FOR THE UNWARY. I THINK, SIR, I SHALL SOON MAKE FRIENDS. ATTEND TO THEIR QUALITY, MA'AM. I RESPECT YOUR ADVICE, SIR. ARE YOU GOING TO LONDON, SIR? YES. I'VE BEEN ON BUSINESS TO PLYMOUTH, A CITY, I REGRET TO SAY, OVERPOPULATED WITH NONCONFORMISTS. MAY I ASK, SIR, THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS? I'M A BANKER, MA'AM. MMM. MMM. [CHUCKLING] DEVILISH AMUSING, SOME OF THESE BISHOPS. AH... I SEE I HAD NO NEED TO FEAR THAT YOU WOULD GO UNPROTECTED IN LONDON. YOU WEAR A RING, MA'AM. YOU HAVE A HUSBAND. UNFORTUNATELY, SIR... I'M A WIDOW. 'TIS A DROLL CHANCE THAT BRINGS US TOGETHER. HAPPILY, MA'AM-- UH, UNHAPPILY, UH, I AM A WIDOWER. OH. GIVE ME THE POT OF JAM, WILL YOU? AAH! [INSECTS BUZZING] WHOA! WHOA! GUARD? SIR? WHAT'S TOWARD? THERE'S A DEAD MAN ON THE ROAD, SIR. KEEP YOUR EYES ABOUT YOU. THAT'S AN OLD TRICK. STAND FAST! I'LL DROP THE FIRST MAN THAT MOVES. A HOLDUP! MY WATCH! OH, THANK HEAVEN! I'VE NAUGHT ELSE BUT A HANDFUL OF GUINEAS. AND YOU? I STILL HAVE MY HEAD, SIR. IF YOU'LL CALM YOURSELF. HAND ME THAT CUSHION AND THEN LISTEN A MOMENT. NO BRANDY, NO CONSIGNMENTS OF CLOTH, NO LACE, NO BULLION? NOT A THING, SIR, BUT THE PASSENGERS' BAGGAGE. I SWEAR IT, SIR. LET ME SEE THE PASSENGERS. SQUINT, SEARCH THE COACH. MAY YOU BURN IN HELL, SIR, FOR YOUR DAMNED IMPUDENCE. AND MAY YOU DIE A SLOW DEATH, SIR, OF THE TEDIUM IN HEAVEN. MEANWHILE, YOUR PURSE. A RING, SIR, PERHAPS? YOU WOULD NOT LIE TO ME, SIR, I HOPE? ALL RIGHT, SIR. WOULD YOU MIND ALIGHTING, M'LADY? I WANT TO SEARCH THE COACH. THOUGH YOU ARE A SCOUNDREL, I SEE YOU'RE A MAN OF MANNERS. THIS YOUNG LADY, WHO'S TRAVELING UNDER MY PROTECTION, IS, IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING SO, WITH CHILD. NINE MONTHS, TWO WEEKS, FOUR DAYS. AND NO MIDWIFE 'TWIXT HERE AND SALISBURY. I ENVY YOUR HUSBAND HIS CHILD. ALAS, SIR, I'M A WIDOW. THEN YOU'VE LOST ENOUGH. I'LL TAKE NO MORE. GUARD, YOU CAN MOVE THE CART. MA'AM. COURTESY, YOU APE! ASSIST THE LADY. AND YOU, SIR. I'LL STARVE MYSELF BUT NOT MY HORSES, SO I'LL HAVE YOUR WIG. AS I THOUGHT, SIR. A CRAVAT PIN. DRIVE ON, COACHMAN. BY THE LOOK OF THINGS, YOU'D BETTER MAKE GOOD TIME TO SALISBURY. RIGHT. GO ON. GET UP, BOY. [WHISTLES] COME ON, TOBY. THAT'S THE BOY. GOOD LAD. WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? ALL RIGHT. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? FOUND IT UNDER THE SEAT. 'TIS HERS. I SAID WE'D SPARE HER. YOU SPARE TOO MANY. THAT'LL TEACH YOU TO DISOBEY ORDERS. &quot;LADY BLYSTONE.&quot; TITLED, TOO. A WIDOW, CHILD ON THE WAY, WHY SHOULD A MAN RISK HANGING, SQUINT, WHEN THERE ARE WOMEN LIKE THAT NEEDING COMFORT AND CARE... AND A MAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO SPEND THEIR MONEY? LONDON! PLAYHOUSES! PALACES! GAY PROMENADES! MILLINERS! DRESSMAKERS! HATTERS! JEWELERS! HOSIERS! HABERDASHERS! HAIRDRESSERS! AND...HUSBANDS. GET AWAY, YOU GOATS! GO ON OFF! BE OFF OVER THERE! GO ON OFF IT! WHOA THERE! AH, HERE WE ARE. A VERY AGREEABLE JOURNEY, MA'AM. YOU'LL WANT A PORTER, MISS? HOW MUCH? [SCREAMING] ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T FEEL SAFER IF I ACCOMPANIED YOU? THANK YOU, SIR, BUT I HAVE MY PORTERS. I SHALL TAKE A CHAIR. YOUR SERVANT, MA'AM. CHAIR! HERE, MADAM. HEY, YOU. HERE, FOLLOW THAT CHAIR. MOVE OVER. SIR! HOW DID YOU KNOW I-- IS HER LADYSHIP AT HOME? BY SAINT BARTHOLOMEW, YOU! I CAME TO INQUIRE AFTER MY OLD FRIEND LADY BLYSTONE. I'M STAYING WITH LADY BLYSTONE. OH, I SEE. SHE WILL NOT BE BACK UNTIL TOMORROW. INDEED. THE HOUSE, I FEAR, IS IN SOME DISORDER. LADY BLYSTONE'S SERVANTS SEEM TO HAVE GONE. HER SERVANTS MAKE A HABIT OF GOING, AND FOR GOOD REASON. BUT YOU ARE NOT THEN STAYING IN THIS HOUSE ALONE? UH, FOR TONIGHT, YES. HMM. ONE CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE NEW TO LONDON. WHY? ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF THE DANGERS, A WOMAN ALONE IN THIS PART OF TOWN? DANGERS? HAVEN'T YOU HEARD OF THE MOHOCKS, GANGS OF YOUNG MEN WHO TERRORIZE THE STREETS? YOU SAW THEM AT THE COACHING STATION. THEY STOP AT NOTHING-- ROBBERY, ARSON, RAPE. WHY, ONLY LAST WEEK, IN THIS VERY STREET, A GIRL OPENED HER DOOR TO LET IN HER CAT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID? THEY SLIT OFF HER NOSE WITH A RAZOR! WHAT...WHAT SHOULD I DO, SIR? ALLOW ME TO BE OF SERVICE. I HAVE NO ENGAGEMENTS THIS EVENING. PERMIT ME TO STAY AND KEEP YOU COMPANY. WELL, I HARDLY THINK, SIR, THAT WOULD BE SEEMLY. WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR? I AM AN ALDERMAN OF THE CITY OF LONDON, A PARISH COUNSELOR, A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE REFORMATION OF MORALS. DO YOU THINK I CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH A WOMAN WITHOUT OFFERING OFFENSE? I TAKE THIS ILL THAT YOU SHOULD SO MISJUDGE MY CHARACTER. NAY. I DID NOT MEAN TO OFFEND YOU, BUT I'VE SCARCE SEEN THE HOUSE. I KNOW NOT WHAT ACCOMMODATION THERE IS. THEN LET US RECONNOITER. SHALL WE? A BED BUT NO LINEN. A SMELL OF MICE, BUT NO BED. AH! DEAR, DEAR. A BED... AND LINEN! ENOUGH FOR A WARM NIGHT. WE'VE NOT LOOKED AT THE ATTICS YET. THEY LEAK. LADY BLYSTONE TOLD ME SO. YOU ARE NOT PROPOSING, SIR, THAT-- YOU'VE KNOWN ME LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW MY CHARACTER. DO YOU SUPPOSE I CAN'T SLEEP IN THE SAME BED WITH A WOMAN WITHOUT ACTING LIKE A BEAST IN THE FIELD? WE'RE BOTH PEOPLE OF PRINCIPLE AND FAR REMOVED FROM LEWDNESS. HOWEVER, IF YOU STILL HAVE SCRUPLES, HERE. THE RAMPARTS OF CHASTITY. NOW THEN... A PILLOW. WHAT'S THIS? &quot;GIN.&quot; A VULGAR BEVERAGE, BUT EFFICACIOUS. [LAUGHING] [GLASSES TINKLING] YOU KNOW, ON GIN AND WATER A WORKING MAN CAN GET DEAD DRUNK FOR TUPPENCE. THEY SHOULD IMPOSE A TAX, MA'AM, TO KEEP SUCH PERNICIOUS LIQUORS FROM ALL BUT THE, UH, THE MORE RESPONSIBLE CLASSES. OH, LORD. I MUST GET OUT OF HERE! PSST! THE COAST IS CLEAR. DUNS, BAILIFFS, DEBT COLLECTORS, THEY ALWAYS SMOKE PIPES. WHY DON'T YOU PAY SOME OF YOUR DEBTS? THEN WE COULD WALK DOWN THE STREET WITHOUT FEARING A BAILIFF ON EVERY CORNER. THEY'RE HERE! THE BUMS! WHY, WILLIAM! A NOCTURNAL VISIT? I CAME TO PAY YOU A CALL, MY DEAR, TO SEE IF YOU WERE BACK. AT DAWN? YOU NEVER WERE AN EARLY RISER, WILLIAM, SO FAR AS I REMEMBER, EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR ONE PURPOSE. BUT I'D HEARD YOU BECAME A CHURCH WARDEN AT ST. BRIDES. THE SPIRIT WAS WILLING, BUT THE FLESH WAS WEAK. THE SPIRIT SMELLS UNCOMMONLY LIKE GIN. OH, THE FLESH GROWS WEAKER WITH THE YEARS AND LESS ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE EXERTIONS. YOU'RE SO RIGHT, MY DEAREST ONE. POOR DEAR. YOUR SERVANT, MA'AM. YOUR SERVANT. TO LIE WITH A BANKER ON HER FIRST NIGHT IN TOWN IS A GOOD BEGINNING. IT SHOWS PROMISE. [DOOR SLAMS] WHY, MIGGY, YOU'RE VERY PEEVISH. HA. PAY SOME OF MY DEBTS. IF YOU WANTED A RICH MAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE MARRIED HIM. TWAS NOT FOR WANT OF HIS ASKING. I KNOW HIM TOO WELL. HE'S A SAINT IN THE DAYLIGHT AND A DEVIL IN THE DARK. &quot;SIR, WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT &quot;WAS MOSTLY MY FAULT. &quot;IT IS I, NOT YOU, WHO SHOULD MAKE AMENDS. &quot;I HESITATE TO ENTRUST YOUR RING TO A SERVANT. WHEN CAN WE MEET AGAIN SO I MAY RETURN IT?&quot; SIR? WHAT...? WE PUT DOWN STRAW TO QUIET THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS. THERE'S A MAN IN THERE DYING. MADAM. MAKE HASTE WITH THOSE LEECHES. HE'S AS BLUE AS A BUTCHER'S APRON. MY HAT? WHAT SHALL I DO WITH MY HAT? HERE. OH, THANK YOU. ARE YOU THE NURSE? WHO NEEDS A NURSE? MY MASTER WAS OUT ALL NIGHT IN THE RAIN. HE'S PROMISED 1,000 POUNDS TO THE CHURCH IF THEIR PRAYERS PULL HIM THROUGH. HE RECOVERS! HE RECOVERS! HE'S SPOKEN AGAIN. HALLELUJAH! AND ORDERED TOAST AND TEA! TOAST AND TEA! TOAST AND TEA! THAT'S A CHANGE FROM WINE AND WENCHES. HE'S REPENTED ALL RIGHT. COULD YOU... GIVE HIM THIS? BUT THE CAUSE, DOCTOR, THE CAUSE? A MORBID FLUX OF VISCOUS FLUID CONGESTED THE PASSAGES TO THE VITAL ORGANS. I WAS NEAR DEATH? CLOSER THAN I AM TO YOU, SIR. AND THIS CONGESTION OF FLUIDS-- SHH! HERE WE ARE. IN HERE. AH! THESE LEECHES, SIR, WILL DIMINISH THE PLETHORIC HUMORS, AND BY REMOVING THE UNHEALTHY EFFUSION, REPLETION, AND EXCESS, RESTORE YOU TO NORMAL, IF DIMINISHED, HEALTH. I SHALL RECOVER? ONLY BY ADOPTING A WAY OF LIFE LESS ROUSING TO THE SANGUINARY CHOLERIC AND MELANCHOLY HUMORS. GIVE IT BACK TO HER AND ADMIT NO MORE WOMEN. BY THE BACK DOOR OR THE FRONT.

HMM. POOR, FATHERLESS CHILD. WHAT'S THIS? A CONVERSION? THE FATHERLESS CHILDREN YOU'VE FATHERED WOULD FILL AN ORPHANAGE. DUTCHY, I'VE BEEN THINKING. HIGHWAY ROBBERY'S NOT WHAT IT WAS. 'TIS TIME I FOUND A SETTLED WAY OF LIFE. LADY BLYSTONE. NOW, IF I HOOKED HER... YOU? LIVE OFF A WOMAN? MMM. WHY NOT? IT'S QUITE RESPECTABLE, DONE IN THE BEST SOCIETY, AS LONG AS YOU MARRY THEM FIRST. MARRY? IT'D MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU AND ME, JUST A KIND OF INSURANCE AGAINST BAD TIMES. I COULD RETIRE. MAKE AN HONEST MAN OF MYSELF. TO WED A LADY OF TITLE, YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE SOME STATION IN LIFE. I THOUGHT OF BEING AN OFFICER OF DRAGOONS. HER FRIENDS WOULD SPOT YOU FOR A FRAUD IN FIVE MINUTES. NAY, BUT A SHIP'S OFFICER, THAT COULD SUIT US. YOU'D HAVE TO GO OFF ON LONG VOYAGES. MONTHS AT A TIME. WE'D BE AS SNUG AS A BUG IN A RUG. NOT AN OFFICER. A SHIP'S CAPTAIN. AH, WITH RICH ESTATES. ABROAD WHERE SHE CAN'T INSPECT THEM. I'LL NEED A NEW OUTFIT, SOME FINERY ABOUT ME. SQUINT! HALLO. FETCH US THAT SUIT OF CLOTHES TWISTY STRIPPED OFF THE ADMIRAL ON THE PORTSMOUTH ROAD. YES. AND YOU, JEMMY, YOU'LL NEED A GOOD POWDERED WIG AND A COACH. HE'LL NEED SOME LIVERY. WE'LL ALL NEED SOME MONEY. WHERE'S IT COMING FROM? I'LL ADVANCE IT. FOR A 1/5 SHARE OF HER INCOME FOR SEVEN YEARS. 1/10 FOR THREE YEARS. SIX. FOUR. FIVE. DONE. ALL AROUND IT'D BE A GOOD STROKE OF BUSINESS. MIXING IN SOCIETY, YOU'D GET INFORMATION I COULD PASS TO OUR LIGHT-FINGERED FRIENDS. A RESPECTABLE MARRIED MAN I'LL BE, WHO KEEPS A MISTRESS AND BUYS HER TRINKETS. THINK OF THE PICKINGS, DUTCHY. AND WITH ME A GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE, THINK OF THE TIME FOR LOVING. IS THIS REAL? UH-HUH. AND THE LAST. IT WILL HAVE TO GO. OH, MY LAST DIAMOND. WE COULD TRY YOUR FATHER AGAIN. HE'S AS POOR AS WE ARE. HE'S A DUKE. HE CAN GET CREDIT. YOU'RE A COUNT. HOW MUCH CREDIT CAN YOU GET? HE'S A REAL DUKE. YOU MEAN YOU... OH, MY TITLE... THERE ARE FAMILY DISPUTES. UNFORTUNATELY, MY FATHER THE COUNT DID NOT MARRY MY MOTHER. HOW COULD SHE HAVE BEEN THE COUNTESS? AH, SHE WASN'T. SHE WAS THE COOK. THE COOK. AS LONG AS SHE WAS A GOOD ONE. COME, MY LOVE.

YOU'LL OBLIGE ME BY INFORMING MILADY BLYSTONE THAT CAPTAIN MEREDITH, ASHORE FROM HIS SHIP THE SEA HORSE, DESIRES A WORD WITH HER. AND YOU'LL OBLIGE ME BY KEEPING YOUR HOOKS TO YOURSELF. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? IT WAS STOLEN. I AM HERE TO RETURN IT. AND HOW DID YOU GET HOLD OF IT? FROM TWO SCOUNDRELS WHO WAYLAID ME LAST NIGHT. I REFORMED THEM WITH MY FISTS, AND THEY JOINED THE SEA LION'S CREW RATHER THAN HANG. ANOTHER OF YOUR SHIPS? THE SEA LION IS A SISTER SHIP TO THE SEA HORSE? AYE, AYE. SISTER SHIPS THEY ARE, AND NO PRETTIER SISTERS AFLOAT. AND THE HAT? PART OF THE BOOTY THE SCOUNDRELS BROUGHT ON BOARD. NOW CONDUCT ME TO LADY BLYSTONE. I'LL TAKE IT. SHE'S NOT-- I WISH TO SEE HER IN PERSON. I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO WAITING IN KITCHENS. YOU'VE WAITED IN KITCHENS BEFORE NOW, AYE, AND TUMBLED THE KITCHEN MAIDS, TOO. I DOUBT LADY BLYSTONE WILL RECEIVE A MAN OF YOUR MANNERS. DON'T MISJUDGE ME, YOUNG WOMAN. A LIFE AT SEA LEAVES A MAN WITH ROUGH EDGES. WHY, ON MY ESTATES, I'VE RECEIVED GREATER LADIES THAN HER. COUNTESSES, DUCHESSES. YOUR ESTATES? AYE. IN VIRGINIA AND THE INDIES. AND YOU HAVE TWO SHIPS AS WELL? MM-HMM. THE SEA HORSE LYING AT WAPPING AND THE SEA, UH, SERPENT ON PASSAGE BACK FROM JAMAICA. MY.
