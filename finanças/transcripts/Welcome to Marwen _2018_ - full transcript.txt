Subtitles by explosiveskull Fighter Command, this is Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo. I just tiptoed into one hell of a triple-A shit storm. Like the freaking Fourth of July up here. I got flak coming in from everywhere. Damn it! Mayday, Mayday! I'm hit! I'm on fire. Got smoke everywhere. Smoke coming in. Got no control. There's a river and a swamp below. I'm gonna ditch her there. Atta baby. I'm going in. Son of a... Lousy Army-issued goddamn flammable boots. Frilly underthings. Not bad. Hmm. Not bad at all. Wen haben wir denn hier? Einen Amerikaner. That's right, Fritz, an Ameri-can-doer. Hände nach oben. Sorry, I don't speak Nazi. Hands up. Die Pistole. Kommen Sie mal her. Kommen Sie her. What? Ein schmutziges amerikanisches Schwein! Go ahead! Laugh it up, Heinie. But these heels ain't for sale. Since you obviously would rather like to be eine frau, perhaps we should cut off your schwanz. Oh, yeah? Well, schwanz this. Tritt dem Homo in die Fresse! Who are you? My name is Wendy, and you are saved. Hey, looking good. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Jesus. Damn. You got to be kidding me. Well... Shit. I guess I got it. Yeah, I think I finally got it right. After all these years... How long has it been? Three? Three years. Jesus. Three years. Time flies when you're having fun. Right, Hogie? I'll put the pumps in the bar. Sorry, Wendy, you have to go back. That was then; this is now. How you doing, Deja? Um... Hi. You got here so fast. Just one sec. I have to unlock the door. Keep your head down, Deja. I say she's the new neighbor. A redhead. You're just jealous. You always have been. Oh! Give me a break. Are you kidding? You have been doing the same thing for centuries. Uh-oh. Here comes trouble. Nicol? What's all this? Huh? I need you to stop, and I need you to leave right now. - Leave? - You have to leave. - Why? - You have to stop harassing me. Her name's Nicol. That's a nice name. I'm asking you nicely. - Okay? - Hey, hang on, Nicol. Harassing you? Really? - Yes, really. - I come home, you're gone. - No call. You didn't tell me. - I need you to leave. I'm... - What do you think, Deja? - I'll go. If that's what you want, I'll go. Yes, I want you to go, Kurt. All right, I'll go. I'll go. His name is Kurt. And he's a dick. - Hi, Anna. - Dobriy den, Mark. I bring grocery and mail. Here. I bring you timer clock. Use to breathe. 30 seconds, no more than one minute, when you get anxiety, huh? Mark, how you feel? Horosho? Okay. Um, pretty good, I guess. - And how is Captain Hogie? - Um... - The SS beat him. - Again? But Wendy and the women saved him. Ah, Wendy. She come back to Marwen? No, no, she's never coming back. I just resurrected her for an old picture I wanted to fix. Picture for show? Ah, show looks good. - You go? - No way. That's something Roberta and her cousin cooked up. I don't... I don't want any show. Not to go is dumb. Bad choice. I bring you more meds. Huh? What happened? - Why you need more so soon? - I... - dropped 'em in the sink. - Ah, again? You take only one, da, only one for day. Too many is no good, is dangerous. I don't know why your doctor still gives them. It's not good. They're very addicting. You can be addicted. So, have you been doing hand exercise? - Da. - Mm-hmm. And what about eating? - Da. - Have you been eating? Net! Way too skinskie! You need meat for bones. Up. Mm-hmm. Hey, hey. Ah. Good. Horosho. Okay, I go. Ah! I forget. - I see Julie. - Oh. Uh, she says hello. She run Rochester Marathon. Oh, Julie. How is she? Is she still in Ithaca? Da. And her kids grow. - Six and eight. - Six and eight. Wow. Okay, I go now. Please, don't lose pills. And don't be stupid. - You are an artist. - Mm. Go to your show. Be proud. Okay. All right. No more playing. You know the drill. That's right. You got it, Mark. Just one foot in front of the other. Come on, baby. You got it. You got this. We're gonna be tangoing next month. You got... I got you. I got your back. I got your back. I'm not gonna let nothing happen to you. - It hurts like hell! - I know, I know. But you gotta embrace that pain, Mark. You gotta love the pain. You gotta love the pain. Love the pain. Hogie... this is Elsa. She's a milkmaid. You found her two klicks east of the river. A squad of SS wanted to... have a sausage party, but you shot 'em. Mister? Uh, what your name is? Hogancamp. Captain Mark Hogancamp, United States Army Air Corps. But everybody calls me Hogie. At your service, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle, après vous. Well, here it is. Beautiful downtown Marwen. Garden spot of Belgium. And my little piece of heaven. It's got everything you need. Fountain, boulangerie, church, of course, market, hotel, sidewalk cafe. And right over there is my place, the world-famous Ruined Stocking. Friendliest bar in all of Europe. There's Julie. Hey, Jules, how's tricks? Suzette, bonjour. What's shaking with le bacon? Qui sont-ils? These beautiful dolls... these are the Women of Marwen. - Who is the new face? - She's a milkmaid. I found her two klicks east of the river. A squad of dirty Bosch bastards were about to have a sausage party, but I shot 'em. - Oh. - Does she have a cow? Got caught in the crossfire. Cow-lateral damage. But what's her story? Yeah. Can she handle a rod? No, but she can handle a teat, that's for sure. She's a milkmaid. All she knows how to do is squeeze cow teats. But you dolls are gonna have to teach her how to squeeze the wretched life out of black-hearted Nazi scum. But she's soft. Probably been soaking in milk her whole life. - Mm-hmm. - Way too skinskie. Mm. No meat for bones. All right, all right, enough with the "skinskie" bit. All you dolls are skinskie. And I hate to pull rank here, but she stays. Capisce? - Mm-hmm. - Come on, honey. I think I have a blouse that will fit you. And I've got a pair of capris that'll look great on you. So, listen, we have rules. Rule number one: Never get too close to Hogie. That's sure to get you killed. Un moment, s'il vous plaît. Captain! Thank you. - Merci. Merci. - No. Don't. Don't. Don't! Don't! The church! In the steeple! Hang in there, doll. We'll have you fixed up in no time. She's losing a lot of blood. Captain... merci. Merci. Poor kid. That lousy Kraut slug was meant for me. That's right, my love. That bullet was meant for you. I'm warning you, Deja. Let's not start some big commotion here. What do you mean, my love? I'm your salvation, your protector. I saved you. Women are hopelessly attracted to you. But I will stop these foolish women! Back off, witch! I've heard enough of your voodoo crap for one day. Voodoo? Well... no use crying over spilled milk. Jules, what's wrong? I don't know. I... I just keep thinking about that poor little milkmaid. She never knew what hit her. Like I said, that slug was meant for me. No. I'm talking about after she got shot. When Deja Thoris zapped her away. Poof! Gone. Just like she did Wendy. Yeah. Just like Wendy. Look, we all know the story. This thing with you and the Belgian Witch has been going on for nearly 3,000 years. The dewy-eyed little milkmaid got a little too close. That's all. Da. Way too close. But what about us? When are we going to get poofed away to who-knows-where? Ixnay, ixnay. She could be hearing us. Dolls, dolls, listen up. Here's what you got to remember. We, us, we're here right now. We're still alive, and that's what matters. So a toast. To life, to love, to Marwen. And the beautiful women thereof. There you are. You sneaky little witch. All right, girls, time to hit the hay. Rack time. Hello. You have reached Mark Hogancamp. He can't get to the phone right now, but if you leave your name and number, he'll get right back to you. Mark, it's Demaryius Johnson. Listen, I'm sorry to be calling so late. And I assume you're monitoring, so I'll try to be brief. Listen, um, I don't know if you remember, but the sentencing is on the 13th, Friday. And, as we discussed many times, it's vitally important that you be there, that you be in court that day. We want the judge to hand down the maximum sentence, so it's-it's important that you're there. To look your assailant straight in the eye and for the judge to see you face your attackers. They need to pay for what they did to you. I want the judge to throw the book at them. I want the judge to throw the book at them. - Hit the dirt! - Hit the dirt! We got Heinies swarming everywhere! I'm out! I need more ammo! More ammo! More ammo! We need more ammo! Goddamn it, get me more ammo! Hello? Is everything okay? I heard screaming. Are you all right? Yes. Okay. I thought I heard you yelling for more gumbo. No. Not gumbo. No gumbo. Okay. Sorry for disturbing you. I love you. Come away with me. I will love you forever. I alone am the one who has the power to help you. Only I can stop your pain. Rise and shine! Rise and shine! Out of your box, and grab your socks. It is Thursday. We have work to do. I suggest that you rise from the prone position. Can you hear me? - Da! - Yes, sir! Keep your eyes peeled. Lousy bastards could be anywhere. Carlala, keep your eyes on the road. Jules, shoot anything that moves. Wilco, Cap'n. - Hi, Larry. - Hey, Mark. Carlala's looking for you. - And, uh, tell her I need more limes. - Roger. And don't forget, uh, Thursday's meatball day. Roger. Meatball day. Hey, Mark. - So that's the guy? - Yeah. He was right out there, right in the middle of the road. Five of 'em jumped him. It's a miracle he survived. Wendy, the woman who used to tend bar here, she found him. Thought he was a freaking garbage bag until he moved. Let me tell you, Carlala, Deja vanquished her. So she just zapped her away? Yep, just like that. - Just like Wendy. - Wow. That Deja Thoris is a real piece of work, isn't she? But I don't understand; why is she being so weird? She loves Hogie. She wants him for herself. Mark, can I ask you a question? How come I have to be alone in Marwen? Hmm? Don't I ever get a lover? You never know. Patton's Third Army may be rolling through anytime now. Well, if that happens, make sure to keep that Belgian Witch far away from my man. Nah. Deja only cares about Hogie. She's obsessed with him. Do you ever hear from Wendy anymore? Wendy, do you take Hogie to be your lawfully wedded husband, until death do you part? I do. Then, by the power vested in me by the Kingdom of Belgium and by the supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, I now declare you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. She moved on. What? What did you say? I said, "She moved on." I heard she moved to California. Oh, yeah, right. California. Mark. - Hello. - Hello, Roberta. I'm making some coffee. You want some? No, thank you. Jeep looks good. Mud splatter's really cool. Mm. It's gonna take a long time and a lot of miles to get the right amount of wear on those tires. The coffee's good stuff... dark roast Colombian. Oh, no, I've had enough already today. All you ever drink is coffee all day long. Yeah, I need to cut down on my caffeine, I think. - It's decaf. - Well, I'm kind of in a hurry, so... - It's instant. - Um, oh-oh... yeah, okay. Yeah, instant decaf. Great. It'll be ready in a jiffy. Okay. - Hey, Mark. - Hmm? My mom's baking a ham on Sunday. Do you want to come over for dinner? Ham? Your house? Well, it's my mom's house. But, yeah, my house. Um... yeah, I don't know. I'm-I'm not really crazy about ham. That's okay. I'm sure she'd be happy to roast a chicken. Ugh. I'm not crazy about chicken, either. - How about pot roast? - Uh, that gives me gas. - Ribs? - That's kind of messy. Um... Sushi? Your mom can make sushi? No. But we can find a place to get it. Actually, I've... I've never tried sushi. But I'd be happy to go with you. I've never tried it, either. - Oh. - Um... Wow. Look at that. It's another thing we have in common. Neither of us has ever had sushi. I'm looking for a Glamonista doll with red hair. A redhead? I thought you liked blondes. Yeah, but I need a redhead. - Oh, yeah. - How about this one? Yeah. Oh, good eyes. Nice paint job. What are you gonna name her? - Scarlet? - No, Nicol. - Nicol, huh? - Mm-hmm. Come on, Nicol, let's ring you up. - Put her on your tab? - Yeah. Oh, hey, are you excited about your show? My cousin is thrilled. And so is everybody at the gallery. Oh. Check this out. This SS general just came in. High-end figures are so cool. They're so beautifully detailed. Do you want me to wrap it up, too? No. I can't... I... I can't afford this. It says here he's a major general Waffen-SS. Fought in Belgium in 1944. Isn't that a coincidence? Name's Kurt. Kurt Meyer. ...for the five assailants convicted of the beating of local artist and photographer Mark Hogancamp. Let's go live to Jennifer Cook, - who's at the Ulster County Courthouse... - I'm sorry, Mark! - I'll get the remote! - ...with the latest update. Jennifer? Yes, Bill, I've just been informed Judge Harter has revoked the request for a further psychiatric evaluation of one of the defendants. The sentencing will proceed as scheduled for the five convicted assailants responsible for the brutal attack of the local artist Mark Hogancamp. For crying out loud, Carlala, what do you think this is, the Indy 500?! I'm only doing 80. I'm sorry, Mark. Take this medicine, mein love. It will make you feel better. I know how much you suffer. How much it hurts. How much pain you've endured. I will always be there for you. I'm the only one you can trust. The only one who understands you. The only one who feels your pain. The only one who loves you. Take this medicine, mein love. Take this medicine. Take this medicine. - Get away from me now! - Ooh! - Du dumme Schlampe! Du dumme Schlampe! Das reicht. Bitte, mein Fräulein. Just tell us where we can find your Cap'n Hogie, and we will be on our way. I promise. Get your mitts off me, you filthy scum. Oh! You heard her, scum. Get your filthy mitts off of her. Schnell! Come on. Get 'em up. Reach for the sky. Let me see a two-handed "Sieg heil," you box-headed Rhine monkeys. Same goes for you, four-eyes. Hey. Where's my top? - What happened to my top? - The Nazis ripped it off. Again? I know. It never ends with these guys. Hey, I brought your doll. You left in kind of a hurry yesterday. What was her name again? - Nicol. - Oh. Thanks. And I found these in the thrift shop. - Oh, wedges! - Yeah. - Oh! - Definitely vintage. 1960s, size 11. - Mm. - The lady in the shop said they were espadrilles. Cool. Espadrille wedges. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I felt bad about the TV yesterday. You seemed pretty freaked out. You taking your meds? - Mm-hmm. - Good. So, are you gonna go to the sentencing? I doubt it. I'll go with you, if you want. Uh-uh. It's important. You need to go. So those jerks get what they deserve. You can't let them get off lightly. I mean, they ruined your life, for cripes sake. I can't. I can't be in the same room. I understand, but running away is not helping you any. Oh, hey. Are you sure you don't want the SS doll? It's better-made than any of the high-end action figures or even the Glamonistas. Did someone say "Glamonistas"? I... Uh, the gate was open. I hope it's okay. I... I love Glamonistas. I hope I'm not interrupting. I, um... I just moved in across the street. I just wanted to say hello. I'm Nicol. - Hi. - Hey. I'm Roberta. This is Mark. Hi, Mark. - Nice to meet you. - Mm. I always liked the name Nicol. Oh, yeah? Thanks. Mine's spelled weird... without the "E" at the end. So, you bought Colleen's house? I did, yes. I love it. Aren't Colleen and her husband just the sweetest, cutest couple? Mm, yes. They seem very much in love. They were always very nice to me. I'm... sad they left. Aw. What is all of this? Is this a model train? This is the world-famous village of Marwen. It's an art installation of Mark's. Marwen. Isn't that near Poughkeepsie? This is Belgium, during World War II. Mm. Mm, I've never seen anything like this. And you're an artist? I just take pictures. He's just being modest. He's a great photographer. And he has a show opening in the city on the 27th. Wow, that's great. Oh, I'll get you a flyer. I work at Al's Hobby House, by the way, so... I'm ready to fill any of your Glamonista needs. - Oh, great. - Yeah. Well, um, I'm sorry to have interrupted. It was nice meeting both of you. Okay. Well, now we know who Nicol is. Well, that's better. Oh, we have to do something about those shoes. I gotta tell you, Nicol, even though stilettos aren't invented till 1954, they're totally you. Are those espadrilles? Sorry. Sorry. They're wedges. I heard what happened to you, and I just want to say that I'm really sorry and that you didn't deserve that at all. I'm really sorry. Those from Zappos? No, they're vintage. - 1960s, I think. - Oh, yeah. I think my mom used to have a pair just like that. Something going on in the church? Oh, yeah. You mind if I take a look? No. I love how everything is so cute. All the little flowers and the mailbox, and these cute little curtains. It's just all the details. Oh, my God! What are they doing? Who are they? They are Nazis. Torturing Hogie. - Why? - They hate him. Because he's an American? Because he's different. Well, what's gonna happen to him? That's a complicated story. Well, tell me. I'm fascinated. - You really want to know? - Yes. Okay. The Women of Marwen are the women who guard the village. - And they have gathered at the bar. - Mm-hmm. And they haven't seen Hogie in a while. Has anyone seen Hogie? No. Not since breakfast. I heard him say he was going to check the church. Excuse me. Hi. I'm new. I just moved in across the street. I'm looking for your C.O. That will be Captain Hogie. Nobody knows where he is. And who... who are you? They got Hogie! Five SS men are holding him in the church! They're whipping and torturing him! - Let's go. - Wait! We can't. The Krauts have the church surrounded like a fat-ass sitting on a BB. There's no way for us to get in. They'll kill Captain Hogie the minute they see us. Well, what can we do? We can't just leave him to be whipped and tortured. I have an idea. Hallo, meine Damen. Comrades, let's party. - We got schnapps, baby. - Ja, let's trinken. Oui, juste comme le Oktoberfest. That's right. October-fiesta. Ja! Bring Deinen süssen Arsch her! Bottoms up, girls. Let's toast 'em. Ja! I'm saved. You're saved. I'm saved. You're saved. You have the most beautiful eyes. And the most amazing heels I've ever seen. They're called stilettos. But they won't be invented until 1954. It's weird, huh? A lot of weird stuff happens here in Marwen. Lot of stuff that makes no sense. Like how you got here. I just moved in across the street. What's your name? "Nicol, without the 'E' on the end," she says. To be continued. That's sweet. Mm, that's one heck of a story. It's kind of violent. But at least the Nazis are dead. - That's good. - Well, for a while. They seem to have more than one life. And I like that Nicol. She's pretty clever. I like her, too. I like to wear heels sometimes. I don't know why, but they somehow connect me to the essence of dames. Does it bother you? It doesn't bother me in the least. Good. 'Cause I love dames. I do love dames. Sweet dreams, Nicol. Welcome. Good night, girls. I think they're in love. What does Deja have to say about all this? Ugh. She's not happy. Last night, I actually caught her trying to... - What? - Nothing. I mean, I know that you were saying that I'm crazy, but I just personally don't trust this Belgian Witch. I think you need to keep an eye on her. I know. I know. She keeps bringing the Nazis back to life, and that confuses me. What was that redhead's name again? Nicol, without the "E." Right. And who is she named after? - No one in particular. - You're not gonna tell me? Hey, Mark. You got a phone call. It's your lawyer, Johnson. H-He's sorry to bother you at work, but he says he needs to talk to you. Tell him... Tell him it's meatball day. He knows it's meatball day. Well, then... tell him... tell him I'll call him later. Roger. Hi, Mark. - Hi. - Hi. Are you just getting home from work? Yeah. Can I ask you a favor? Um, I have a hutch inside that I need help moving. Would you mind giving me a hand? - Sure. - Okay. Uh, okay. Okay. Thank you. It's really heavy. How's your day? Are you having a good day? - Good. Yeah. - Yeah? - I like that hat. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Thank you. What the hell? My brother is into stilettos. Six-inch heels or higher. He and his family live up in New Haven. - Mm-hmm. - He... He also collects lingerie. Mm. Hmm. I just collect shoes. You have a shoe collection? I have 287 pairs. Oh, so you only have a shoe fetish? Oh, I wouldn't call it a fetish. I'd call it essence. A woman's essence. I collect women's essence. When I wear them... I don't know why... they somehow connect me to the essence of dames. Of women. Hmm. I get that. Does that bother you? No, it doesn't bother me in the least. Is that why you got beat up? Well, I was wearing running shoes that night. But I guess I said something about essence. That's awful. I'm so sorry. I'd been drinking. I drank a lot in those days. Maybe if I hadn't been drunk, I would've kept my mouth shut. Don't say that. There's no excuse for what they did to you. It's a hate crime, plain and simple. No matter what you said. - Okay? - Hmm. I think I used to be a pretty good illustrator. Even though I can barely write my name now, I have these World War II action comics with my name on 'em as illustrator. Pretty cool. You don't remember what your job was? No, no, they kicked every memory I ever had right out of my head. They kicked all of the memories out of your head? Well, I still remember facts and stuff, like multiplication. But I... I have no memory of my personal life. Everything from before the attack is gone. All I remember about the attack was the word "queer." They called me queer. And... Tammy Wynette was playing on the jukebox. "Stand by Your Man." That's all I remember. That's awful. You're lucky they didn't kill you. I guess. I was lying in the road for over an hour, and that's when Wendy found me. She was bartending that night. Um, just one second, okay? Oh, yeah. - Hello? - Okay. Yes. Yes, it's Nicol. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can be there. What time? Have they removed the ventilator? How many cc's? Okay. Has anyone contacted the family? All right, good. Okay, I'll be there. Okay, great. Thanks. Work. What are you gonna do? Do you like teapots? Yeah, I love tea. I love everything to do with tea. I love making it. I love the ritual of serving it. I'm even thinking about building a teahouse, - now that I have a yard. - Mm. Just a little one in the backyard. The last time I had tea, I was in the hospital. I bet. It has amazing therapeutic benefits. Are you a nurse? I'm a vet tech. - A veterinarian technician. - Oh. And I also volunteer at Under One Woof. Under One Woof. - Get it? "Woof"? - Mm... Animal shelter. Mm. - Right. - Okay. Anyway, thank you. - I really appreciate it. - Thank you. Here, have this. - Oh, no. - It's from the movers. Thank you. I don't drink anymore. I haven't had a drink since... They beat it out of me. Beat me sober. Okay. Oh. Here. How about this? - Muffins from the Realtors. - Oh. Thank you. Okay, so we'll have a cup of tea sometime? Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Let's get together for tea sometime. Tea and muffins. What a cozy idea. - Kurt, what are you doing here? - Who is this? It's Mark. He lives across the street. Ah, jawohl. Was ist los? Achtung. Sprechen sie Deutsch? Sieg heil! Oh, for God's sake, Kurt, stop it. - So tell me, Mark. - Please. Please don't. - What's with all the Nazi toys and shit, huh? - Stop it. You some kind of white supremacist - pedophile, Mark, huh? - Stop it. Such a jerk. Oh, I'm a jerk? I'm a jerk? Hello, Mr. Johnson. Afternoon, Mark. You're a difficult fellow to get ahold of on the telephone. Yeah, well, I've been pretty busy. I can imagine. I'm extremely glad I caught up with you finally. I took a chance and drove out here to implore you one more time to... please attend court tomorrow. It's important that you appear at the sentencing. I don't want these guys to just get away - with a slap on the wrist. - I got... I have to go to work. - It's meatball day. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Meatball day was today. I had your suit and shirt dry-cleaned and pressed. I spoke with your friend, Roberta, from the hobby shop, and she's agreed to pick you up in the morning and stay with you throughout the proceedings. Yeah, I don't know, Mr. Johnson. Mark... I've prepared a victim impact statement for you to read tomorrow. All you need to do is read it, and it'll be, uh, officially entered in the court records. I'll then speak about the extent of your injuries. How you were savagely beaten. How they nearly pummeled you to death. You do remember how you were beaten, don't you? I'll then show the court your art journals. The elaborate illustrations you used to draw. Mm, no. This mentions high heels. I don't want to talk about high heels. Mark, I put the high heels in there because I want to reinforce the idea that this attack was a hate crime, not just some street mugging. I want your attackers to be locked up for a very long time. I want the judge to see your face. Understand... you're a suffering human being. I've seen cases like this go both ways. Okay, I'll go. - Good morning, Mark. - Morning. Morning, Roberta. I think maybe the dolls should stay in the car. I never go anywhere without my backup. Can't he bring them as kind of comfort items? Then just bring one. All rise. The Superior Court of the State of New York, County of Ulster, is now in session. The Honorable Martha J. Harter presiding. Morning. Please, sit. Thank you. Having been found guilty by jury to the charges of gang assault in the first and second degree and reckless endangerment in the first degree against the victim, Mark Hogancamp, the defendants are summoned here today to the Ulster County Court for the purposes of hearing the recommended sentence. Does anyone have any legal reasons why I cannot proceed with sentencing? - No, Your Honor. - No, Your Honor. Before proceeding to sentence, do the People want to make a statement? Yes, we would like to, Your Honor. Is the victim here? Would he like to address the court? Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Hogancamp, please address the court when you're ready. Order! Order! Or...! Get down. On your feet, Hogancamp! Go, go, go! Counselor. Is Mr. Hogancamp all right? Your Honor, if it please the court, the prosecution requests a 20-minute recess. I'll do you one better, counselor. Seeing as Mr. Hogancamp is obviously out of sorts today, I'm hereby postponing these sentencing proceedings. Court will reconvene on the 27th of this month at 10:00 a.m. in this chamber. Court is adjourned. Hi, Mark. It's Roberta. Wow. Some day, huh? Uh, we were on the news. You probably didn't watch. I can't believe the judge put the new sentencing on the same day as your art show. What a mess, huh? But, um, anyway, let me know if you need anything. Talk to you. Bye. Excusez-moi, monsieur. I was just doing the polishing. Well, bring them Frenchy ta-tas over here, baby. I got something for you to put in... I'm cracking up. All right. Oh, God. It's such a beautiful moon. It sure is. Just like you. - Hey, Hogie. - Mm-hmm? I've never been happier. Don't. It's like I've been telling you. - I'm cursed. - No. Whenever someone I care about gets too close... Shh. We got company. Mark? It's Nicol. - Hey. - Hey. Tough day yesterday, huh? I saw you on TV. Um, anyway, I hope I'm not disturbing you. Mm. I just wanted to apologize for Kurt's behavior. Is that your husband? - No. No. - Is he your boyfriend? For, like, ten seconds. - He scared the crap out of me. - Yeah, I know. He definitely has his issues. That's for sure. I think it's a cop thing. He's a cop? Yeah. Well, was a cop. Uh, is it okay if I come in for a second? Oh, yeah, come in. Um... Yeah, Bomb Squad commander. Endicott PD. Um, until he got his second DUI. - I... - Uh, can I take your coat? Oh, sure. Thanks. Um, anyway, I was cleaning out my closet. - Thank you. - Thank you. And I thought you might like these. Oh. I put a lot of miles on some of 'em, but some of 'em I only wore once. And those are my old heart spikes. Are these Christian Louboutin? No. They're knock-offs. - Those never really fit me. - Mm. So, look, if you don't want them, just toss 'em. Oh, no, no, no. Are you kidding? I will add them to the collection. Wow. So, this is what 200 pairs of shoes looks like. - 287. - Wow. I have no idea where they came from. I got back from the hospital, and I saw all of these, and I asked my friend Larry, "Do I have a girlfriend?" And he says, "No. These are yours." - Oh. I got it. I got it. - Sorry. Sorry. - That's okay. I got it. - Sorry. Are these your drawings? That's my art journal. - Mind if I take a look? - No. Why World War II? I don't know. At least we were the good guys in that war. - These are beautiful. - Thank you. Hmm. So, you switched to photos? Had to. I can't draw anymore, so my dolls have to tell the story. Oh, I Googled Marwen, and there's no town called Marwen in Belgium. Yeah, I made it up. "Mar" is for Mark, and "wen" is for Wendy. Mm. The same Wendy who found you in the road? Wendy saved Hogie on the day he crashed his P-40. She was the love of his life. Hmm. Hmm. And are all of the dolls in Marwen people you know? Yeah, pretty much. Wendy and Carlala, I met at the Avalanche. Carlala still works there. Um, Anna is my caregiver. She comes every month. She's a crazy Russian. Uh, Julie I met in rehab. She had her leg blown off in Iraq. - Mm-hmm. - And Suzette... Suzette St. Sweet is my favorite actress. - Mm. - She's in the, uh, Backdoor Bodacious Babes series. Hmm. - I haven't seen it. - It's pretty good. What are those two doing? Are they making out? Well, Nicol wants to, but Hogie won't let her. He never lets anybody get too close. Why? He doesn't want to end up alone again. And who is she? What's her story? That is Deja Thoris. She is the Belgian Witch of Marwen. She has a magic glove. Can zap anyone she doesn't like 15 million light-years into the future. Cool. And who is she in real life? Nobody. I'm not sure where she came from. Anyway, I'd like to have you over for tea. - Like I promised. - Oh, okay. Yeah. Um, how about Thursday? Yeah. Yeah, that's great. - Let's say 4:00? - Great. It's official tea time. Um, I make a mean pomegranate cranberry blend. Okay. Hey, you know, I-I got to tell you, from the first time I saw you, I knew you were a stiletto woman. That's why I put stilettos on you. You mean the doll? It's why you put stilettos on the doll? Yes, right. Okay. See you Thursday. Close your eyes. I have a surprise for you. You know I can't close my eyes. I'm a doll. There. Okay. What's the big surprise? Hey, hey. Hey, hey. What are you doing? - No, are you crazy? You're... - Shh. Look. Nothing happened. I kissed you, and nothing happened. Well, I'll be damned. No! They think they are so clever. I will show them. No one defies Deja Thoris. I am the Belgian Witch of Marwen, and Captain Hogie belongs to me. Me and no one else. You will build me a time machine! A time machine? Jesus Christ. - Carlala! - Oh, my God, Mark! You scared the shit out of me. - Is Larry here? - Yes, he's out there. Mark. What are you doing here? We're closing up. Hey, Larry, can I buy that lava lamp off you? - Lava lamp? - Yeah, we could really use it. You want to climb in there and blow the dust off it? You can have it. Thanks. Geez, this town of yours has turned into some kind of Melrose Place. They're only safe to make out between midnight and the darkest hour before the dawn. I see. - So, nothing happens to her, huh? - Mm-mm. You think it's a time thing that allows them to kiss? Yeah, could be that. Or something else. What? True love. I think Hogie's in love. I like this one in the churchyard. It has beautiful lighting. Are you gonna present these in your show? Oh, hey, do you have any, um, miniature teapots, cups and stuff? - Teapots? - Yeah, teapots, teacups. In the doll house section. So, listen, my cousin has to print the program for your show. So he wants me to ask you once and for all, are you gonna go? Yes. What? I said, "Yes." Are you sure? 'Cause he's putting in the program - that you're gonna be there. - I'll be there. Are you gonna do the court thing in the morning? Because the sentencing is the day after tomorrow. Do you have any doll-sized cookies? No. But you know what? We just got in some new fruit salad. Wow! A Purple Heart. Look at that detail. Just like the real thing. Speaking of which... Oh! - How much? - $39.95. 40 bucks for a Purple Heart? Al said it belonged to a real wounded vet. Not yet. - Don't look. Don't look. - Now? - A little bit further. - Okay. Okay. Ta-da! A teahouse. Just for you. It's beautiful. I've always wanted a teahouse. How did you know? - Little birdie told me. - Thank you. Thank you! May I pour you a cup of cranberry pomegranate? Yes, please. Oh. I have one other little surprise. There's something I've been meaning to ask you. I wasn't able to scrounge up a ring, but as soon as the war ends, I'll buy you a beaut. It's a promise. Wow. Wow. He built her a teahouse, and then proposed to her in it? Yes. That's right. Wow. That's exactly what Nicol said. And then he gave her a medal? Well, he couldn't find a ring. - Remember? There's a war on. - Oh. - Um... - Yeah, of course. So, uh, Roberta told me that you decided to go to your show. I think that's a great idea. - Yeah. - I think... Mm-hmm. Um... there's Hogie's Purple Heart. He got hit in Burma. He was serving under General Stilwell. - Oh. - And... there, they decided to get married at night, one minute after midnight. - Mm. - So, when it's time to kiss the bride, they can, you know, do it. Hmm. And he got down on one knee and everything. - Mm-hmm. - What did he say? "I never met a doll with such a gorgeous set of torpedoes in my entire life." Such a charmer, that Hogie. And you are the most thoughtful, generous, kind and beautiful woman I have ever been lucky enough to know. It would be my honor. Would you marry me? Mark. Get up, please. Get up now. I'm sorry, I think this has been one big misunderstanding. I... Sorry if you mistook my intentions, but I don't, um... I'm sorry, uh... We're friends. We're, uh... we're really good friends, but we're just not in the same place right now. But I really value our friendship. But I don't s-see our friendship in a romantic way. And you deserve someone who does. Um... I'm sorry. If... I hurt you, that was never my intention. Hey. I have something for you. Um... M-Mark, will you look at me? Or say something? Okay, I'll be back. Okay. Mark? I got this for you. I wasn't sure what you needed, but the guy at the hobby shop said... Damn it, Deja. Oh! Oh, yeah, you really are a piece of work, aren't you? Huh? Yeah? So, now it's me, right? Why are you all of a sudden following me? Yes, it's ready. It's exactly what you asked for! It's a countdown timer. 55 seconds, then a one-way trip to the future. Of course it can fly. Mark? I know you can hear me. Um, I got you this. It's to commemorate your show. Um... Okay, well, I hope you like it. Jawohl. Was ist los? Achtung. Sprechen sie Deutsch? Sieg heil! No! Hogie? Where'd you go? Scheissen. When are you gonna get that Belgian Witch off your back? What are you doing here? What do you want? I want you to grow a pair. That's what I want. I want you to stop acting like a sniveling little... That was a Luger! Oh, no. Oh, no, what has happened? Some Nazi bastard shot her. Look, the medal stopped the bullet from hitting her in the heart. Oh, but she's losing a lot of blood. Guys, we have to go. Why...?! The hell are you? Queer? What, are you queer and deaf? I asked you a question, asshole. Do you wear women's clothes? Shoes only. The higher the heel, the better. Oh, yeah! You dirty queer! It is you. You're the one who is deficient, worthless, crippled by fear. Oh, you see. There is no justice for you. You can never go to that courtroom, because you are the guilty one. What happened at that bar was your fault. That is why you are unloved, mein love. I am your only hope. The only one who can remove the pain. The only one who can grant you freedom from shame. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being alone. And ashamed. Here are her heels. Keep them close, Hogie. We got your back, Hogie. We always have your back. We're here for you. It hurts, Jules. It's so painful. I know, but you have to love the pain, Hogie. Like the wise man said, "Our pain is our rocket fuel." It reminds us of our strength. Her heart is weak. Only time will tell. I've done all I can do for her. All we can do now is pray. I'm not really sure how to do this. But if you're up there and you can hear me... You got to be shitting me. This is the answer to my prayer? So, we finally meet, Herr Kapitan. I see you sprechen sie English, Fritz. Hands... up! Good. Now stand. Slowly. So, how'd you find me, Fritz? Turn. Bitte. Remove the weapon. Schnell! Step into the aisle. Bitte. Was? Stöckelschuhe? You are a weak and pathetic little man. And after I kill you, I will kill all of the filthy women in your stupid little town! You just don't get it, do you? Women are the saviors of the world! Stöckelschuhe. Oh, come on! Oh, that's not good. Oh, nuts! What the hell is this contraption? - A time machine. - Time machine? It will take us to the future. Ze future? Yes, mein love. 15 million light-years into the future. So we can be free. You see? They are back. They never die. Oh, nein. Oh, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein, nein. That's right! They never die, mein love. They will never stop torturing you. Wait. The stilettos. They're Nicol's. I need both of them. No way, Deja. I cannot leave one of Nicol's heels with a Nazi! Eat lead! Give me your arm. Give me that shoe. Can't you get this crate any lower? You spy! That's right. It's you. You're the one keeping the Nazis alive. - That's right. - And keeping Mark sick! - That's right! - You're the problem! You are his addiction! I will not let you kill him! In the name of Marwen, I vanquish you! Nicol. - We got 'em all. - And this time, - the bastards aren't coming back. - Yeah. Nicol? Wake up. Wake up, sweetheart. Please? Please. You came back for me. Of course I did. I would never let you go. My true love. What about Deja Thoris? She's gone. Gone for good. She's out of my life forever. She's never coming back. Auf Wiedersehen. Can't write worth a damn. Hey, Mark. Happy Friday morning. Mr. Johnson asked me to give you a call to remind you that today is court day. Remember to wear your sport coat and a collared shirt. Mr. Hogancamp, please address the court when you're ready. "I was a hell of a good artist, an illustrator. "I loved to draw, "and now I can barely write my name. "The life I once had "has been taken away from me forever. "I was not wearing high heels "the night I got jumped, Your Honor. "But I did mention "that on occasion I might try them on, "and because I made that comment, "they beat me severely. "They jumped me from behind and kicked every memory I ever had out of my head." Now, I admit that I had been drinking and I was drunk, and the way I responded wasn't smart. But now I know I... I know what I should have done. I should have kept my mouth shut and walked away, but I didn't. And I got beaten. Beaten within an inch of my life. Beaten for no reason. And I needed you to know that, Your Honor, because... whatever sentence you decide to give these... ...so-called people... ...I want them to know they can't hurt me anymore. They can't hurt me anymore. Because they're gone. They're gone for good. But I'm still here. And I have my friends. And I have my town, and I have my pictures, and I'll be okay. How do they feel? Pretty great. I know I keep saying it over and over, but gosh darn it, Mark, you did it. And you're still breathing. Did they have stilettos during World War II? No. There are a lot of strange things in Marwencol. I'm sorry? Marwen what? "Col." Marwencol. I'm sure there is a story. You want to hear it? Okay. Well... after Deja Thoris zapped herself 15 million light-years into the future and the Nazis were eliminated, peace and happiness reigned throughout. And in commemoration of this epic event, Hogie decided to rename the town. Oh, now I get it. The "col" is from Nicol. Nicol without an "E." I... I suppose, in life, in real life, some of us are just destined to be alone. Maybe never find love or know another's essence. But others... others are more fortunate. Like Hogie and his Nicol. They found true love. In Marwencol. Marwencol. Has a nice ring to it. Roberta? Do you want to go get sushi? Well, we've never tried it. We might not like it. Maybe we will. You're right. Let's go for it. Subtitles by explosiveskull
