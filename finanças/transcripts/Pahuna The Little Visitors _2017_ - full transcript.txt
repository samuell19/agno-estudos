Pranay! Manju. You go ahead. They are too close. What about you? I will try to distract them. Please take the children and leave. -I'll meet you later. -No! Come with us. Take the children and leave! I said, go! I'll see you later. Mom! Where is Dad? Dad will follow us. Come on, let's go. Mom! Dad? He will be fine. Let's go! Come on. Sister! Listen up. Until I return, consider yourself as his mother. And you are the man of the house. -I'm going back to get your father. -No, Mom. -Just follow the group. -No, Mom. Don't leave us! Manju! What's wrong? Be quick! I will be with you, every second. I will come and find you. I promise! Go with the villagers. Promise me. Promise me that you won't leave the group. Stay with them. And protect each other. Promise me. -We promise. -Promise. Sister. Take care of my children. I need to go back for their father. Go. Come with me. Come on. Mom! What are my children doing? Have some food. Please eat well. Hey! Why are you not eating? Please eat. You'll be strong only if you eat. Only the strong ones can survive. Remember one thing. The strong ones live while the rest perish. This rice beer keeps my old bones from rusting. Have you ever heard of it? Even the yeti loves this rice beer. But my teacher says that yetis don't exist. Nonsense! Your teacher knows nothing. I have seen him with my very own eyes. What does he look like? He is tall and scary. You will look like mere bugs in front of him. He is covered with white hair. Long and gross. He looks like an ape. But walks like a man. Usually, he resides in the mountains. No one sees him. Where did you see him? I saw him at our village. He was this close. This close! Damn! He could've killed me with a single punch. But, he didn't. Do you know why? Because he could smell the aroma of my rice beer. My father had brewed a particularly good batch. That scoundrel! He snatched my beer and ran back to the mountains. If it weren't for this rice beer, I would've been-- Brother! Will you stop scaring the children? Shut up! The rice beer helps me battle the cold as well. It is not just a beer. It is pure magic. Children, finish your food. I've made myself clear, I won't go. Why, Uncle? What is the problem? People of Sikkim are quite nice. I have been to Pelling once. We'll find employment there. Moreover, our relatives are also there. They can help us. -There's a church over there. -Church? You think the church will help us? You are much more stupid than I thought. I think the Christians are extremely nasty. -Monsters! -Uncle, please! Don't talk rubbish. Trust me. They try to make you forget your own beliefs and your own religion. Really? Uncle, stop scaring them. They should be scared. They are very strange. They make you eat all sorts of weird things. It is disgusting! Have you seen their priests? They wear long gowns... so that they can kidnap the children. After kidnapping the children, they turn them into slaves in the name of God. -Uncle-- -Shush! Let him speak. And they eat infants. First, they feed them a lot. And then, they eat them up. Those monsters! Don't listen to him. -He is talking rubbish. -He is my brother. I love him more than my life. But he does speak nonsense, at times. Please trust me. They are not monsters. So, Pelling it is. I warn you. They are demons. They will eat your children. I'm not going to any church out there. You know what surprises me? They say, he killed his own family. Then, he shot himself in the back. Does that make any sense? Are we idiots to believe such nonsense? Listen up. Last night they were discussing about the place we are headed to. -Where are we going? -Pelling. -So? -We are going to a church. -Is that bad? -Yes. Why? There are monsters there. -Monsters? -Yes. The priests! Priests? They have magical powers. They make us forget our beliefs and our religion. Why would they do that? They eat babies. -They eat babies-- -Shush! -They eat babies? -Yes! They turn children into slaves and then they eat them. Then, why are the villagers going there? Maybe because they are not children. We can't go with them. But mother insisted that we should never leave the group. Mother also said that we need to protect each other. But, where will we go? Anywhere but the church. But first, we need to make sure that Bishal is with us. Amrita. You want me to hold him? No, I'm fine. Okay. Let's go. Pranay. Amrita. What are you doing? Quickly, now. Keep up the pace. It's ahead. It's behind us. I know everything. Just walk. -Greetings! -Greetings. Where is Pelling church? Oh, it's down there. Behind you. You've come way ahead. You've entered the town. Just go back a hundred meters and take a left. The path is a bit rough though. -Okay, thanks a lot. -Thank you. Where are you coming from? Daalpur. Oh! That's quite far. You must be tired. Can I get you some water or tea? No, that's okay. -We are in a hurry. Thank you so much. -Goodbye. Bikram! Where are the children? I think we lost them. I think so. But we should keep moving. What happened? Where will we go? Where will we stay? I wonder where our mother is. Hey, I am here! We will find a safe place. Amrita, why did we have to leave home? If we hadn't, those people would have killed us. Why? Who are they? Did we do something wrong? No, we didn't do anything wrong. Brother, we need to take care of Bishal. Please don't cry. Come on. Pranay, let's find a place to rest. We have to feed Bishal. Pulses. Beaten rice. Sugar. Banana. Apple. Biscuit and kerosene. That should suffice for a few days. If food runs out, we have some money as well. But we don't have clothes. We have clothes for Bishal. That's enough. We won't have to use it. What? The money. Why? Mom will find us before that. That's true. -Amrita. -Yes? Let's find a place to sleep. It's about to get cold. Come, I'll wrap the baby around you. Mom will find us, right? Of course she will. Are you hungry? Amrita. Do you think our father... Brother. You like bananas, don't you? It's going to get cold. We can close the windows. It will still be cold. Pranay. Pranay. Pranay! Pranay! -What? -I need to go. Pranay! What? Where to? I need to pee. -Right now? -Yes. -Outside? -Yes. -In the dark? -Yes! You know I'm afraid of the dark. I know. But I can't go alone. Go ahead. In front of you? Go behind the bushes. Why couldn't you hold it until morning? Dear God! What if the priest comes? Let him come. I will beat the life out of him. What was that sound? Nothing. What was it? I hit the tree. Why? To scare the priest. Is there a priest here? No. Then, stop scaring me. What? The flame is too bright. Someone could find us. We have to put it out. But, how? Take Bishal. Hurry! So, there's no fire inside? No. Now what? We wait for the smoke to clear off. Then, we sleep. Lately, I've been thinking. Why do these Christians make us forget our Gods? I have no idea. All I know is that I don't want to get caught. They make us forget our religion so that we are unable to pray to our Gods and escape. Get down. What happened? -We need to hide. -Why? It's a priest from the church. Priest? Are you sure? The old man said that they wear black robes. And a cross as well. What's a cross? Fingers? -No! -Then? It is made of gold or something. Where do you think he is going? He might be looking for children, I guess. We have to be careful. He might come back. We need to clean this place up. And the windows need to get dirty so that he can't see through. Our hearts beat faster With every passing second Oh Mother, where are you? As evening comes, our hearts start crying Oh Mother, please come and console us But we still go about our lives That is what we have to do Tomorrow is an unsolved mystery Today is a gift to embrace Glimpses of your face Appear again and again Your sweet voice echoes, Oh Mother Oh Mother Oh Mother Oh Mother We came to find peace Instead, we found emptiness We don't know where we are headed How? Why? What happened? No answers But the questions are too many But we still go about our lives That is what we have to do Tomorrow is an unsolved mystery Today is a gift to embrace Oh Mother Oh Mother Oh Mother Oh Mother -What are you doing? -Shush! Catching a rabbit. -Can you? -Yes, if we remain quiet. Have you done this before? Yes. Now, keep quiet! -When? -Long ago. -With whom? -I saw Bikram catch one. Now, stop talking! But you haven't done it yourself. Bikram taught me. Please shut up now! I don't think it will work. It will, if you keep quiet. I don't think-- Why can't you keep your mouth shut? -How can we ever-- -Shush! Yes! Hurray! Hurray! -Amrita. -Yes? -Now what? -Now, we can cook it. How? First, we have to... kill it. You do it. Bishal. Animals are our friends. We should love them. We should not eat them. If we eat their flesh, we would be evil, like the priest. Brother, let him go. Why? He could be our pet. He might have a family. And a mother, right? Will his mother find him? Mothers always do. I think he has peed. No, I already checked. Hungry, maybe? What's wrong with him? Let's swing him. No, this isn't working. Why are you crying, Baby? Please tell me. Where is it hurting? Here? Here? Here? His stomach is hurting. How do you know? I know. Go out and ignite the fire. Me? Outside? Okay. You stay with him. I'll go. Don't worry, Baby. Sister will use her magical powers and cure you, instantly. What's causing the pain? The little brat just needed to fart. Bishal farted! Bishal farted! Fart as much as you want. My dirty brother! My little fart machine! Now, this is too much! Fart as much as you want, Bishal. Suntali, get down. Suntali! Get down before I decide to come up. Come here. We need to go home now. Come down, fast. Be careful. She is a naughty one. Come on. Careful. Good job, Kid! -What is your name? -Pranay. Pranay? Thank you, Pranay. I've been trying to get her down since an hour. Don't know what I would have done without you. Where do you live? Nearby. Really? When I was young, I could catch a flying bird. I guess old age... catches up with everyone. Are you new here? -Never seem to have seen you before. -Yes. Now, taking the goats out to graze is also getting difficult for me. Why do you do it then? -Do what? -Taking the goats out to graze. Well, they have to graze. They need to eat. Ask someone else to do it. You are very old. Old people should take rest. Yes, I am old. But, there is no one to help. What about your family? I do have a wife. But she is older than me. Don't tell her I said so. She might slap me. You don't have children? My son... took the goats out to graze one day. The goats returned home. He didn't. He didn't return? Didn't you look for him? I looked for him everywhere! Now these goats only have me. If you don't mind, I can take these goats out to graze. -Really? -Yes. I can do it for you. You are very old. You should rest. Not sure if I should be grateful for the help or feel insulted because you called me old. Show me where you stay. I'll come tomorrow and take the goats out. I know how to do it. I am sure you do. You look like a smart boy. Come Birkhe, Harke, Furba, Suntali, Kanchi. Let's go home now. Even I am getting hungry. This boy must be hungry too. Where were you? You know how worried I was? What if the priest had come? I followed him. Idiot! What if he had kidnapped you? Oh! I didn't think about that. Stupid! What is that? I got a job. This is my salary. His son never returned? I think the priest took him. Poor guy! -That is horrible! -Exactly. Poor old man. Why don't they come back? Who? The children that are not eaten. Why don't they return, once they grow up? If they can make you forget your Gods, maybe they make you forget your family too. Pranay. We can't get caught. Mother will be heart broken if we forget her. I miss our mother. She will find us, right? Of course she will. If she was here, you know what she would have said? Finish your food! And wash your dishes after eating. But she is not here, so I will do it tomorrow. Lazy bum! What happened? From now on, I will do the dishes. Yeah, right! -You know what our mother used to say? -What? If we were to eat in the dishes washed by you, we would die of some disease. You are lying. I'm telling you the truth. Why do you think she never let you? Because I am a boy. You wish! Baje, I've got all the goats back. Baje! Pranay, wait! I'm getting you some milk. Here you go. Is this knife sharp enough? Yes, very sharp. -Can I borrow it for a day? -Why? I have a task. What task? -Please listen to me. -I am listening to you. I need a knife. A long bamboo. Few stones. And a long rope. Anything else? -Nothing else. -That's it? -Can I see now? -Not yet! -What are you doing? -You'll see. -Can I see now? -No. -Now? -No! Come with me. Now. Whoa! Now you won't hurt yourself. -You made this? -Yes. -For me? -Yes. Pranay. You've become responsible like the man of the house ought to be. -The bamboo was very heavy. -Shush! Listen carefully. What? Music? Where do you think the sound is coming from? It is very pleasant! What happened? Nothing serious. The kerosene is over. I'm afraid of the dark. Stop acting like a baby. Stop it. Tomorrow, I'll go and get some kerosene. We are running out of food as well. Come, sit next to me. Come here! Pretty little baby, a treasure of love May you keep smiling forever Beyond the rainbow, There's a kingdom of colors There's also a bright moon in the sky The night sky is painted With the moonlight Looks like a beautiful fair Go to that fair and sit on a train That train shall take you To your dreamland Go to that fair and sit on a train That train shall take you To your dreamland Good morning. Hi. How are you? I'm alright now. But, it's getting difficult. Even something as simple as getting a glass of water, is very tough for me. Has the doctor given you a due date? He said it could be anytime after a month and a half. -Just around the corner. -Yes. How's your husband? As usual, busy with work. He travels quite often. All husbands are the same. Can I get a Colgate? One Colgate, for the lady. Thank you. Auntie. My stuff? Seventy rupees. Seventy rupees. This is Nepalese currency. This currency is not Indian. The note doesn't contain Mahatma Gandhi's picture. But money is money. Yes, but this isn't IC. -IC? -Indian Currency. -This won't do? -No, it won't. Child! Can you pick this up for me? Thank you. Auntie, I can help you with all your chores. What? I heard you tell that lady that work is getting difficult for you. I am quite skilled. Why would a young girl like you need to work? I need IC. IC? Indian Currency. To buy food and kerosene. My brother is scared of the dark. Scared of the dark? Where are your parents? Are you alone here? Not at all. My father is away. And my mother is ill. Oh, she is ill. I see! Will you hire me? Okay. Come on. Let's go to my place. I'll show you around. Come. Come in. Whoa! You like the house? -A lot! -A lot? -Want some water? -No. -Who else lives with you, in your house? -I live with my two brothers. My ill mother. And my father. But he is away. Do you go to school? Absolutely. I study in class three. I am the best student in my class. Really? -Which School? -K.C. School. K.C. School? Not around here, is it? It is quite far. I walk for hours, everyday. Nowadays I need to look after my brother as well. -But your studies are important. -Yes. Once my mother is alright, I'll start going to school again. Alright. Here. Weren't you at the shop to buy some food? And you need money for kerosene as well. IC. Indian Currency? Here. Take it. This is your advance salary. Here. -May I take your leave? -Yes. What happened? -Didn't you see him? -See who? -The priest. -Priest! -Was he here? -Yes. I think he left. Wow. You bought so many things. No. I have a job now. I got it from the lady who hired me. Food and Indian currency. Now you don't have to work. Stay home and take care of Bishal. Why do I have to stay with Bishal? Who else will? I can't leave my job. Why not? You don't even get paid. All you get is milk. I can get that too. But I got the job first. But I am earning a lot more. Moreover, I am the elder one. -But I am taller. -Don't talk like a fool. I've promised the old man. He is really old. -Stop acting like an idiot. -You are an idiot! Stop acting like a baby. You are a baby. You are a cry baby. I'm not crying, you are. -My brother is a cry baby! -You are. -You are a cry baby. -You are a cry baby, not me. -You are a cry baby. -You are. -You are a cry baby. -You are a cry baby, not me. I won't stay with you. Cry baby... Pranay! Pranay! Pranay! Pranay! I know you are up there. I have a plan. Both of us can work. How? Get down. Look! I can leave at eight and return by two. Then, you can leave. No, I need to leave early to return before sunset. -And I'm-- -I know, you are scared of the dark. I'm hungry. I've already taken food and money from her. I've already given him my word. Bishal sleeps at that time. So? Listen. If you put him to sleep before you leave, I can be here before he wakes up. What if he wakes up in between? Once he sleeps, he is out for two hours. Sounds good. You need this to keep track of time. You should have this. Amrita. -You are very intelligent. -I know. -Pranay. -Yes? I need to pee. Oh! Come on! I told you not to have water so late. Now, hold it. But, I have to! -Good morning, Auntie. -Good morning. Sit down. You told me you go to school. Yes. So, you know how to read? Yes. Can you read the newspaper for me? Newspaper? Yes. From now on, this is a part of your job. Read the newspaper for an hour, everyday. Read it. -Amrita. -Yes? -Share it with your brother. -Okay. -May I leave now? -Okay. -Amrita! -Yes? -Come early tomorrow. -Okay. Nature has allowed time to flow To make things sweeter than honey Yesterday is a closed chapter Today is a ray of new hope We continue to march with gallant hearts Hoping that tomorrow's sun Will bring joy along Walking through the vastness of the hills There is light all around and within Those small innocent eyes Melt the hearts away Waiting for the next moment With eyes full of hope A little bus became our home Fear began to flee Firewood instilled warmth within us Birds up in the sky say, "Hello neighbors" In our small new world In our small new world We have arrived at the land of serenity Hearts soaring high with the clouds The chilly air calms down everything In this new-found soil We shall plant saplings of happiness We shall gaze up at the sky And scribble down our own destiny Those small innocent eyes Melt the hearts away Waiting for the next moment With eyes full of hope A little bus became our home Fear began to flee Firewood instilled warmth within us Birds up in the sky say, "Hello neighbors" In our small new world In our small new world -I'm here, Sir. -Hi! Come and join me. What are you cooking? Smells wonderful. It will taste even better. It was my son's favourite. I don't cook it at home because it upsets my wife. That's why I prepare it near the outhouse. Do you wonder where he would be? Every single day. But, I have no answer. What? My mother gave it to me. She gave me a locket and she gave a watch to Amrita. Keeps us safe when she isn't around. And Bishal? What about Bishal? What did she give Bishal? Bishal has us. His brother and sister! Okay. You can go. The food will be ready when you return. You can take some home. Go. When I fell near the waterfall, my brother used a long bamboo log to make a tap for me. The tap controls the force of water. So I could wash the-- What happened? I'm fine. Auntie. I can't get through. Auntie! Auntie. Ma'am! Something is wrong with Geeta Auntie. She is in a lot of pain. -Come fast. -Okay. Auntie. Something is wrong. I can't get in touch with him. This pain is killing me. You are about to deliver the baby. No, it's too soon. Your baby doesn't think so. It is in a hurry. Get some hot water in a bowl. And, listen! Get a couple of towels. Cut a clean sheet into small pieces and get that here. Listen to me! I have done this before. You are going to have the baby now. Push harder. Harder! A little harder. Here. Towel? Push! Push! Push. Harder. Towel. Yes, you can do it. Auntie, everything will be alright. Push! Push! Harder! Despite being a month early, she is very healthy. -Are you okay? -What? I will never have a baby. You were good with the baby. Why do you say so? I have a little brother. Bishal. Child! Bishal! Are you crazy? You could have died. -My brother. -The baby? -My brother is in the bus. -He was. Where is he? We didn't know what to do. So we gave him to the priest. Priest? Go to the church, you'll find him. Pranay. Bishal! Momma! It's all my fault. We will get him back. How? What if the priest catches us? I don't care. I would prefer being eaten than facing our mother without Bishal. He is our baby brother. We have to get him back. Is this the church? It's empty. Bishal is not here. You said the priest took him. Where else could he be? I don't know. Let's go. Bishal must be somewhere around. But, where? Let's check inside. Hey! What are you doing? He is just a boy. Maybe he has also been kidnapped. Why are you hiding? He is fat. Maybe they fatten them up before they eat them. Let's ask him. Are there other children with you? -What? -Shush! What? Are there other children with you? Yes. Is there a small baby as well? Where did he go? Yes. Did they bring him in, today? Yes. It has to be Bishal. Is he wearing pink clothes? Wait! Yes. It's him! Let's get him. -Where are you going? -Shush! Where are you going? We will rescue you as well. Just be quiet. But, where? -Just keep quiet. -Shush! It's locked. There must be a backdoor. Come on. -Hey! -Shush! -Amrita? -Yes. It's very dark. Stay right here. I'll get Bishal. Shush! Where is the baby? They took him. Where? Ask her. Who are you? What are you doing here? Who are you? Where are you going? Amrita, run! What are your names? Where do you live? Where are you from? Where are your parents? Are you hungry? Want to have some biscuits? Here, have some biscuits. Listen to me. You don't have to be scared. No one will hurt you in here. Yeah, right! -Don't talk to him. -Why? You can talk to me. Look! If you don't talk to me, I'll have to call the police. You'll have to speak to the police, then. Yes! Call the police. I will tell them what you do here. Shush! Don't shush me. He will eat us, anyway. What! What will I do? Give us our brother back and we won't harm you! What are you talking about? We know what you do with children. We have seen everything. Your accent? Are you from Nepal? He is lying. We haven't seen anything. Just give us our brother back. We won't say anything to anyone. It's locked. I told you not to talk to him. Now he knows that we know everything. He won't let us go. He wouldn't have, anyway. You shouldn't have come along! I didn't want to. But I am here to keep you from getting hurt. Pranay. You are the best brother in the world! Not for Bishal though. He is bringing more people. What are you doing? We either kill, or get killed. Mom! Mom. Mom! My children! Mom, you found us! Where were you? -Where is Bishal? -This man stole Bishal. Now he will eat him. What? It's true. He has taken Bishal. He stole Bishal from our bus. -Bus? -Bus! Bus? Mom, this place is very bad. We have to get Bishal out of here. What are you talking about? They eat babies. Yes. And they make us forget our religion. Who told you all this nonsense? -Uncle Rai. -Uncle Rai. That old man? Is that why you ran away? Bishal! Baby. My baby. What are you doing? He may have eaten some parts. Pranay, they don't eat babies. They have been helping me find you. You know what? Uncle Rai is here as well. Has he forgotten his Gods? No, he hasn't. They are very good people. I don't eat children. I promise. -Mom, you have to meet Baje. -Baje? An old man. I took his goats out to graze. Harke, Birkhe, Suntali, Furba. And he used to pay me with milk. You worked? Yes, and I used to work at Geeta Auntie's place. For food and Indian currency. Mom. Mom? What happened? What if I hadn't found you? But, you did find us! That's true. Come here. Come with me. Where? You will see. Come on. Mom. I never want to have babies. Never? Why? It's a lot of hard-work. Really? There. Dad! Mom. -Dad? -Yes, your father! I thought he was dead. Rubbish! He is okay. Everything is okay. Go. Go. Go! Pranay, come here. Come here! It's true! They are our children! Come fast! Where were you? We were so worried. Little brats! Uncle. Uncle, priests don't eat babies. You lied. Hold your ears. Do your sit-ups. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
