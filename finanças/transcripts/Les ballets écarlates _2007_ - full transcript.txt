THE SCARLET BALLETS Where are you going for your holidays this year? - The kids are at Camp. We're staying here. What about you? - To my in-laws, they're farmers. - You're lucky. - Got a light, please? That's good. Good for the kids. - Yeah. - Thanks. Open it, it's all there. - Well-earned! - Eric! Colette! - He's out of work, got no money, so I heard. His wife left him. He's drinking more and more and— - I pity the children. Well we're not well off but at least we take care of the kids. They have their parents. Hi! - Have a good summer! - Since it's the end of term I have a little surprise for you. A party with some friends. - You still need money, yeah? - Come on! Come on! Colette, you know Martin, right? - Too well! Lets' go! - Will it be a good party? - It'll be amazing! Get in the car! That's great, come on, in you go! MAGISTRATE'S COURT - HIGH COURT COMMERCIAL COURT Good night, Judge. - See you tomorrow, Elizabeth. Have a good evening! - Same to you! I certainly will! Good evening, darling, I won't be home for dinner. - You're not coming home tonight? You could have warned me earlier. I;ve made a courgette gratin. - We'll have it tomorrow, darling. The Prosecutor's called an urgent meeting. Because of paedophiles. - Oh those filthy people! - They're sick! Seriously sick! All the more dangerous because they hide so well that no one suspects them. They are un-de-tec-ta-ble. - Well, goodbye, see you tomorrow, honey. - Hugs Councillor, the Judge is here. He's waiting for you in his car. - Thank you, my little angel Our supplier promised a charming little blond who knows nothing about these games. - I'd love to initiate him! Tut tut tut, my dear Bernard. That requires a lot of subtlety. - I'm not lacking in that! - Not always. You've already damaged more than one. - That's because I'm built larger than average! This is beautiful. Plenty money here. - Better now, right? Look. Another delivery of fresh fleshl - They've got money. We haven't! - But as you know, Colette, it's not just the rich who— - Shut up! - Hey, where's the pool? - Over there. Wait 'til you see it! It's big! You'll have great fun. By the way, you won't act stupid, will you? You know how risky it is, human trafficking. And when it comes to kids— - And yet you're involved. Why? - I've never touched a hair of a chid's head. And their arse! Unthinkable! - Nevertheless, you're here! - For that! Jobs are scarce for a guy like me. - There's drugs? - And the shit! - Don't be rude! - So tell me— As a former schoolteacher, don't you find it disgusting to be here? - Do you want me to get you fired? - Go ahead honey, don't be shy. - Since you like money so much, I would give plenty if you fucked me. - I only consume chicks between 25 and 35. - Bastard! - Old hag! - Stop bragging! As if you'd anything up top, dung breath! - Come in, come in kids. - Eric, go and play, my boy. Colette, you know the way? - Only too well! - You're late with your latest delivery. - I'll pick them up at midnight. - When they're well exhausted. - That's my job. - What a comedown for a killer. I still can't go to the job centre. What are you doing? - I can use this if one day someone wants to piss me off. Are our little cherubs at the pool? - Yes, Councillor, at the swimming pool. - Aren't they cute. - Little cakes to bite into. Go and put on your swimsuit. - Filthy rat! - Your sister still has the same bad attitude, I see. Right, you'd better get undressed too. - No, I'd rather not. Who organized the party? - Is this your first time here? - Yes. Is it good? - You'll see. I'm a piece of shit! I know perfectly well I'm a piece of shit. - Why are you a piece of shit? - Because— I'm a piece of shit. - You've had enough to drink! You're drunk as a skunk! You can't even stand up! Go on, get yourself home. - But— I've got money! - Get out! You shouldn't drink like that. Us Muslims— - But i'm not a Muslim. I don't even believe in God! I don't give a shit! Come on, Simba, we're going to get another one somewhere else. - You shouldn't drink like him, Simba. - He pisses me off! I just like beer. - You should read the Quran. - Well of course. - Come on, Simba! - I'll bring you the French translation - I can't read French, and I can't read Arabic. Come on, come on! How can that drunk take care of his grandchildren? Refreshments, kids. What about me? Filthy rat! So, are they coming? Yes, yes, they're coming! Oh, what a beautiful little boy! Where are you going, sweetie? Not going to get ready? - Yes, yes, I'm going. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen. Very happy to welcome you to the party. A very nice evening in prospect! Our little cherubs are having a wash in the pool. While we wait for them to finish, may I invite you to have a drink? To our health, to this evening. To our future pleasures. To our present desires. - Hello everybody! - Well, you're not getting changed? - No, I'm just watching. Why are all the children in swimsuits? - It's for "fitness". - What's "fitness"? - That's the party. - You disgust me as much as Dad. It's over here, come on! Let's go! It doesn't matter, I still have money We'll go somewhere else. I know a great place! - Ah no, no, I have to go home, I'm exhausted. - You're such a killjoy! Shit! Oh shit! Felix! Felix... Our little guests are coming! That's it, they're brand new, all clean now. Of course, they're straight out of the pool. Oh what a the beautiful little lady! - And look behind her. - Oh, my beautiful little cherubs. What are you doing? Your shorts are all torn. You should be in bed. Come in! This is the office. I'll take you to my apartment. And you've got blood on your legs, too. Did you walk through the brambles? - I don't know, it stung. I don't know the forest I've never been in a forest. Will it hurt? - Less than walking through brambles. Hello kitties, you flirting? But what could you be doing in the forest in the middle of the night? Did you get lost? You were with your parents, weren't you? What's your name? If you weren't with your parents, who did you come here with? You don't want to say? - What was that? There are often prowlers around here, but I think there's a party. - Aren't you scared here all alone? - I'm used to it. I know how to use this! My husband taught me to shoot. He was a forest ranger He watched for the meat-eaters. - Meat-eaters? - The bastards who kill the forest animals to sell their meat. - There's a lot of bastards around here. - Why do you say that? - Is that your husband? - Mmm, but he's not around any more. - He left, like my mum? - Your mum left? You know, if you don't want to tell me things, don't tell me. Keep them to yourself. But you'll suffer. Because you're very unhappy. It's true, you know, terrible things happen in this part of the forest. Look behind you. That's Guillaume. He was 7 years old. My little boy. He was playing around the house with Nixo. He loved the forest, the squirrels. The birds, all the animals. - He wasn't afraid of the animals? In the forest? - Not at all. And then, one afternoon, he vanished. We looked for him everywhere. The police, even the Army searched all over. - To find him? - Yes. But we never found him, my dear Guillaume. Never... I'm Eric! Well, Eric, you're shivering, you're cold Come on, you can sleep here. What a blast! - If my friends could see me. Hot! Hot! That was a show! You had fun, and so did I. To your beauty, Mesdames! You may see your Guillaume again one day. - Oh no. Never. - If he was kidnapped he'll escape one day, like I did. - Like you did? What do you mean? - Was Guillaume's Dad nice? - Yes. He adored us both. - Well that was good. Why isn't he here? - He couldn't bear Guillaume's disappearance. He's in care. You understand? All right, go to sleep. We'll try to see more clearly tomorrow. OK? Good night. That little Romanian boy was really good. Totally inexperienced. I had to teach him everything. - Same for me with the little Bulgarian girl. - Plus, they're cheap. Hey, where's your brother? - He ran away, he didn't like it. - Ran away? What you mean, ran away? Where? - I don't know. Home maybe. - That's a long way. - What's happening? - He'll manage. - No, it's nothing, a kid's missing. She knows where he is. Get in the car. We'll go to your place. There's a problem. A kid's missing. - Shit! That's bad. Most important, don't tell the others. I hope you know where he lives. - I don't look after him, he's Martin's. He just left with the kid's sister. - Sort it out any way you like. But find him if you want to keep your job. You're well paid. But make a mistake, and you know the price. No time to lose. Keep me informed. Understood? - We know you're a marksman. But so am I! Midnight. We've worked well today. But tomorrow it's back to school, workshop, office. Now sleep, and tomorrow work. Ciao! Six classes a day! Juniors and seniors, girls and boys, men and women. People are said to be soft these days, but not that lot! Not tea, some wine! It's a tonic. A great pick-me-up! - You want Cantonese shrimp? - No. A rib-eye steak. That's a pick-me-up too! Yeah— Ah, it's you, Violaine. Yeah, okay, I'll put her on. It's for you. Hello Violaine. Again? What's the story? - The kid doesn't want to talk. All I understood is that the mother left, leaving the husband and the kids. You have to be very careful about that sort of thing. That's for social workers to handle. Stay out of it, otherwise it might backfire on you. Come to see me tomorrow, we'll talk about it. So, dead or alive? He was doing 130mph. Now he's pulp for the mortuary. How are you, Mr Duchêne? - With Eric—at home— - What are you saying? - Martin—at home— - Don't move! Don't move! - the children— at home—not Martin— There's no light on, why not? Your father should be in. - So should my little brother. What could have happened to him? - I don't know! Maybe— - I don't give a fuck about maybes. I want to know! - But I don't know, I swear! Nothing! - Fuck off! Filthy pimp! - Cool eh? Cool, let it go. There's no light. Your father isn't here. It's the right time, it's going to be nice. - Fuck off! - It'll make you feel good. - Get out, I'm fed up! Did you find the kid? - Well, he came back home, of course. Yes. I couldn't talk to him, he's sleeping like a log. - So everything is under control? Oh shit—Shit! And shit! Aren't you afraid someone'll steal your bike at night? - Prowlers don't care about bikes. - And the thugs? - The thugs aren't interested in the forest. - Is it far to your friend's house? - Oh I'm used to it, you know? - Why don't you have a car? - I can't afford it anymore, with my husband in care. No milk, no butter, nothing! The bastard left nothing to eat. Colette, how is your dad? - I don't know, he's not here - He had a serious accident, he's in hospital. - Hit by a car. - So he's alive? Despite everything, I''ll still go and visit him. He's my father. - And what about your little brother? - Oh yes— Where's my brother, pimp? - We're going to see him. - To see him where? Another lie? - No, Eric was taken in by some decent people who picked him up on the road. They rang me. - They don't even know your cell number. Neither does Eric. - I don't know these people, but— But they called the cops. The cops are very resourceful. They found your father's address. - He's in hospital. You trying to confuse me? You're up to another dirty trick. - No, not at all. Come on, I'll take you to these people. Then if we have time, we can go to the police station, okay? - I'm warning you, if you try to cheat me I know how to defend myself, after everything I've seen. I'm going to change. - Fine, meet me at the car. It's parked on the other side. - A social worker should be taking care of these children. - Careful Nelly, careful of getting involved with that kind of stuff. The judges, the testimonies, all the upheaval with Children's Service and— - You're right. Better to stay out of it and avoid trouble. What are you doing at the town hall? - I have some issues to settle with Social Services. You know, when you have a sick husband, there's no end to it. Eric! - What are you doing here? - Vaccination for Summer Camp. - Wait for me here, I won't be long. - OK. Madame Lacroix? Yeah, Madame Lacroix— - How's your husband? - I don't think he'll ever recover. I have a child with me. - That's Eric Duchêne. Has he run away again? - He turned up at my house last night. - Where did he come from? - I don't know. His legs were bleeding. So he couldn't have walked very far. - Maybe it was around where Guillaume was abducted. - I thought about that. But what am I going to do with him now? I'd like to contact his father but I don't know where he lives. - He's an alcoholic. His wife left him with the two children. - Do you know his address? - I'll give it to you. - Well, where's the child now? - With his friend, in the hallway. - That's odd, I can't see him. Listen, do you know where Eric is? - I don't know, he ran off. - He's a runaway. Always got to be at the centre of a drama. Go and see his father right away. He must be back home by now. - All right, ok, I'll let you know. - You, come in. Hey, were you going to leave me at Children's Services? - No, I'm taking you to some friends. Come on! - Is that true? - Yeah it's true. Come on. Get on! I don't get it at all... - What? - How did the cops find my father's name and mobile number? - From Eric of course. The people called the cops. They questioned your brother - Why didn't they call my dad? - He was probably off his face. Either way, he didn't pick up. - And you, how did you know? - These people will explain it to you. We're nearly there. - What are we doing here? - You'll find out when you see them. Right, we're here. - But I can't see anyone. There's no house. - The man is the quarry manager. Out you get. - So that's it. You're going to kill me. - You know too much about me. Get out. Your little brother and your father also know too much. - Kill me in your car. That'll get blood everywhere. - Get out I said! - Fuck you! - Get out! You'll see! Fuck! Oh fuck! Chang! Please, come on. - Hello Violaine. - This is Eric. - Oh, hi! - The little boy. - Yeah, yeah. Good, Juliette told me. Come with me. You can sit here on the chair. So you can watch. - I've entrusted the kid to Chang. - He'll be safe. - I've just seen a social worker. She told me to go and see his father, just in case. To try to find out what could have happened. It seems that Eric is a little runaway. - So you're going to stay involved in this business? - I don't want to abandon the kid. Otherwise he'll end up in Child Protection. What I want is to be able to take care of him. But legally. - All right? - Take your time seeing his father. We won't lose sight of your little runaway. Where are you going, Madame? - What floor does Mr Duchêne live on? - He's not here, he's in hospital. He had an accident. - Really—Thank you, Madame. Ah Mademoiselle? Mr Félix Duchêne please. - Visiting hours are over, Monsieur. - Oh damn! Because my friend had an accident yesterday. I've only just heard. I'd like to know how he is. If it's serious— - Very well, wait a moment. Sorry! Excuse me. How are you doing? Hello - Hello I am Mr Duchêne's wife. What floor is his room on? - First floor, room 24. - Thanks, have a good day. Well, Felix? - Where are my kids? - At home, of course. - Why didn't they come with you? - How should I know? - How are they doing? I never should have let them go with you. 'm going to report you to the police. It was you got me into this. - But no one forced you to accept, right? - I want to see my kids! - What are you doing? Stop! What;s going on? - My children, Madame. - Are you Mr. Duchêne? - This isn't visiting time, Madame. Mr. Duchêne looks very tired. Out! It's not an ID. On the other hand, it'll be useful for me in the future. - Is that a gunsmith's invoice? - Franck knows him, he bought his ammunition from him. - Why don't you tell the police about all this? - Because of him. He's already traumatized enough. I don't want to make it worse. - But what do you expect from a gunsmith? - He might know who owns this gun. - You're getting mixed up in some shady business. - Nonetheless, I'm going. With Eric. Come on, Eric. Ciao. Hello Tatiana. - Violaine, hello. - You have to say hello. - Hello Madame. I'll explain it all to you. Is Mathieu in? - In the next room. - Can I go in? So these, you see, are weapons you can keep at home. But only on condition that you get a gun license when you turn 18. Hello, you all right? - Hello, yeah, fine— - You're not fine at all. Guillaume? - Guillaume, yes, every moment. - I know— - I'd like to know who owns this gun. - Confidential information. Contact the police. - Listen, I'll explain it to you. - So the other one, with the clip, you see? Thatt's called a pistol. You not interested any more? VOTE Jean GASPAR Union for the Modernisation of France Violaine! Violaine! The kid's looking ill! - What's the matter? I can't see anything. - Neither can I. The poster! - It's just a the poster for a candidate in the election. - I know him! - You know him? - The other night, in the house in the forest. - Was he there? - Yes, he wanted to touch me but I ran away. - But are you sure it was him? - Yes! - So now will you tell me who owns this gun? - OK, let's take a closer look. Come with me. I have the money. - All right, I did my job. I took the kids home. - Fred told me about it But don't bring us a kid like that again. He scared the hell out of us, believe me! This way. You're counting it? - It's fine, it's all there. - Everything in place? Nothing to worry about? You stay there, ok? - Wait for us. - Take care. Closed. Hello? Hello Mireille. - Hello Mathieu. - Hello. - Hugo isn't here? - Yes, he is. I can see his car in the car park. He can't be far away. - Well, we'll have a drink while we're waiting. What would you like? - A Coke. Well chilled. - Well chilled. - And I'll have a beer. - Okay, a beer. Here you go. Hey Monsieur, what are you doing in my garage? - No, nothing. It's my son, he's unbearable. I have to get my hands on him. - I understand you, but this isn't a fairground. Hey! My bike! Thief! Look. Here's Hugo. - Mathieu! Violaine! - So how are you? - Well. And you, Violaine? - Oh— o-so. - I know you still prefer not to talk about the drama. - What's the point? - And what brings the two of you here? Well—That! - What's the problem? - Well, he's a customer of mine. - Like all club members. - Yes, but that one wanted a discount card as well as the club card. So, as you'll understand, I refused. - Yes. - And then, he got angry. He left quickly leaving his card on the counter. I wanted to put it through his letter-box, but I don't know his address. - No more do I. - Well, then give it to him. when you can. But that's not the main thing! This is! - Stunning! - Of course! it's from Surcouf's corsairs when they disembarked. So I reloaded it and now I'd like to try it in your range. - Right now? - Yeah come on! We'll take turns. One each. - Come on, let's go to the targets Are you coming, Violaine? - No thank you, I'll stay here. - Very well. - Come on. You'll have to be careful. - Good evening Hugo! - Hi! - See you this evening, Hugo. - I did check it, but of course there may be a crack. That's when everything blows up in your face! Alea jacta est! Come on, your turn. Good luck. - What a jewel, eh? What! He's not there! - Please, don't shout. It'll make Hugo suspicious. - He's left the door open. - All right, come on, something must have happened. So we'll talk t the guy and then see what happens. What worries me is that he asked for information about Martin. What? Violaine? The forest ranger's wife? With Mathieu? We have the address. Let's call the police. - The police never found Guillaume. They find a lot of traumatized children, but no one talks about them. - That would freak everyone out. - We only talk about the ones who died. - That reassures them. "It only happens to others". - I want to know what happened to Eric the other night. I have to know! - This Martin guy is very dangerous. -I'm dangerous too. And I'm armed. Ah, so that's how you found me. - What were you doing to Eric's father? - With a syringe in your hand? - Oh, you know Eric? - I'm the one asking the questions. What happened last night? And where, and who with? - Look, I don't know anything about it. I only drove the kids to the party. That's all. - What kids? - Eric and his sister. - Eric has a sister? How old? - Thirteen. - You're disgusting. Maybe Guillaume, my little boy— - And where was that? - At the hunting lodge. Let's go! Right, let's go. Violaine? Hello. - Monsieur, Madame, good morning. - Are you the caretaker by any chance? - Just the gardener. I don't live here. - No one looks after the hunting lodge? - There are alarm systems. I switch them on at night before I leave. - Do they have parties here? With kids? - Family celebrations? - I've never heard of anything like that. You know, there aren't many children around here. There was one passed by just there. But that's rare, very rare. - What did he look like? - I didn't have time to see. He went like an arrow on his bike. - In which direction? - There, Monsieur, just there. - Thank you. - You're welcome, Monsieur. Good bye. I bet it was Eric that garderner saw! - May God hear you. - This kid is weird, but he has reflexes. He must have gone to your place. - I wonder why he didn't wait for us. Eric saw things, he saw people. He saw compromising things. That was why! He's in danger! - Yes, but we're here. So we're going to rescue him. Hello, little chap, are you waiting for your mum? Let the boy go! You've got guts, my lad, you've got guts! You can't stay here. I'll take you to my second home. - Why didn't you shoot that monster? - If I'd shot him in the back, I'd have been up in court, my dear. Here we are, this is my second home. You'll be safe here. See the river? You can fish. And just at the back, there's a small house, very well set up. It was my father's sawmill. When he died I kept it. And now— - Well, you'll get our stuff for us, won't you Mathieu? A fisherman found the body of a girl at dawn He's worn out. - No wonder after the shocks he's suffered. The victim was found to have been strangled Her name is Colette Duchêne, daughter of a jobless man currently in hospital the girl was known to have led a dissolute life since her mother left. The police is appealing for witnesses to help reconstruct Colette's movements on the 16th Call 04 36 36 36 It just doesn't stop. Is your house three or four km from the castle? - Maybe Guillaume, my little boy— - I have a friend who might know something. We'll see him tomorrow. - Why are you doing all this for us? - Unless you're a saint, no one is completely selfish, Madame. Where do you want the candidate's posters? - Just there, please. - We printed his face on it. You don't want to confuse him with the other one. You know I deliver both? Anyway, I don't vote anymore. Six of one and half a dozen of the other. Please sign here. And there. - Thanks. The invoice will follow in the mail. Ok, thank you, goodbye. - Just between us, the other one has 10 times more posters than you. I wonder where he gets his money, this honest citizen. I didn't want— I didn't want— - That's for Colette! Piece of shit! Paedophiles are un-de-tec-ta-ble. They come from all social classes. - But how are they able to get at the children? - As Freud said: "One does not become perverted, one remains perverted". It has to be said too that there are perverted children. - Ah, they're like adults. They have vice in their blood. - There's also money. The overwhelming craving for money. Even in bourgeois families where seemingly they have everything. - But to prostitute their children? But that's simply depraved! - Before Social Services can intervene, They need evidence. You have no evidence. And it won't be because Eric, a 9-year-old child, recognized— or thought he recognized— the Councillor on an electoral poster that we can intervene against him or his accomplices. - Well yes, that would be defamation, pure and simple. - Our only chance is to infiltrate a ring. They're very organized, they have networks. - But we'd have to have some kind of clue? - I heard there might be—might be—a farm where they take pictures for paedophiles. - But if you know about it, surely the police know too? - The police actually carried out a raid. There must have posted lookouts because all they found was children playing football. - They are really very well organized. - As I told you, they are un-de-tec-ta-ble. What's wrong? - You're going to need a lot of courage. I don't know what happened to Guillaume, my little boy. But as for your sister— - Colette? - They found her dead in the river. - What? We have to avenge my sister! - We don't know who the bastard is who did this. But we will find him, along with the others! We have a clue. - You can help us to avenge her. - We're gonna kill all these bastards! Monsieur? Is there something you're looking for? - What I'd like— are photos of a special kind— - You know Monsieur, when it comes to sex, there's nothing really special any more. Nothing is forbidden. There's no more morality. - Yes but what I'm looking for, I can't get in the normal way. - If it's illegal, I don't sell it, all right? - Maybe I can find it on the Internet? Well, look, the internet— - What I would like is to have pictures— of a boy I know. - So take the pictures yourself. - I am not an art photographer, my friend. - Ah yes, I see, I see— I think I can manage that. - You'll get the other half when I see the pictures. And if they're any good, there'll be others. - All right, I think I'll manage that. But what I need is a meeting with the child. In a safe place, of course. - Yes, of course. I'll arrange that - Very well! He won't come! - Yes he will. He wants the other half of the money. COME UNTO ME MY CHILDREN DO NOT BE AFRAID Even as a child myself I loved children. - More than physical love I think. - My husband was enough for me, he's a good husband. Well? Nothing to report? - No. - Come on then kids, let's go. You little cherubs— Let's go! Come on, kids, come on. Come in, we're going to have fun, you'll see. Come in. The boss! Yes, hello? Yes hello Monsieur. All right, as usual. Well, straight couples, gay, some soft, some hard to finish with, of course. Yes that's fine. You see? He didn't notice anything. He didn't see us following him. - Maxime said there'd be lookouts. Be careful! There's one over there! Here Ernest, a little higher. Kids, come on, this way! So you—like this. All right, will you do that? Good, like this. You, turn your head this way. Good. So afterwards, you know what we're going to do, we're going to undress them. - All right, yeah, yeah. Stay where you are! - Don't move! - Go to the cellar! Quickly! To the cellar! I'm calling the police, immediately! - This i's horrible! It's all children. Only children. It's horrible! When I think of what could have happened here— But they're becoming more and more dangerous! We must neutralize them in any way possible! Gaspar must be informed, and quickly! The campaign is in full swing. There are posters everywhere. We have lots of people supporting us. We are flying to victory! Excuse me. What? First of all, you have to kidnap the child. He'll be our only bargaining chip with our opponents. I'm going there to try to find out what it's all about. What's your name? - You know, you can tell Violaine your name. She's my second Mum. She's very nice. - She must have suffered, this little one. - Martyr— I will avenge them, Mathieu. These children have been defiled, but I will avenge them! - Ok, You go home with Eric. I'll take the little girl to the town hall. - Let's go! Maxime? Yes, I have the little girl Mathieu brought from the photo shoot. You know? Ok. So what has your commando raid achieved? - A shot in the dark. Okay, we caught them in the act— But Violaine has completely lost control. She set the farm on fire. Photos, camera, everything burned. - All the evidence? - Yes. But at least we got some commercial products. For pedos, you know?. Of course we only caught the small fry. On the other hand— Violaine—wants to kill them all. - And what are you going to do to stop her doing something stupid? - I'm not her chaperone but her obsession since her child disappeared is terrible! Her philosophy now is: Revenge is one of the fine arts and forgiveness is a terrible weakness. - I know why you're getting involved in all this. - You do? Well then, since you know, I'm not going to tell you, right? Hey! Caught anything? - No! I did see a trout though! Come on boy, come on. You're going to have a little sleep. Come on! Eric? Eric? .... Eric? Where is Eric? - Who are you? What are you doing in my house? - Where is Eric? - Who's Eric? I don't know any Eric! Get out! - The one at the hunting lodge. - What's going on, Gaspar? - This woman is completely crazy. - Politics again! Get out, Madame, or I'll call the police! - Don't do that! - Little Colette who was found strangled and drowned. Maybe she wasn't at the hunting lodge? - Get the fuck out of here! - Ask him where Eric is! - Who's Eric? - The little boy he wanted to fuck at the hunting lodge! - What? You? Do you touch children? But a child is sacred! - What's going on? - Here, explain it to your wife! - Evenings with children, with degenerates like him at the lodge. - So those were your evenings with your activists? With kids? That's why wives weren't invited! - It wasn't only men! - There, you admit it! - But these are horrible orgies! - What a scandal! - We are dishonoured! - Your sister! Me, your wife! Your children! A trial for paedophilia! - I don't want a trial. There'll just be a bunch of lawyers to get him off. Or he'll serve his sentence and start all over again! We never found my little Guillaume! - Enough about your fucking kid! And it was with your dirty balls that you abused the children! Where is Eric? And my little Guillaume, my child? - Call—Call a doctor. - Where is Guillaume? Where is Guillaume? - It's not me—It's Fred— We paid him for it. - The others— - Who are the others? - Martin, the judge, Hugo— - Were there any more? Who? You have to call the police. - No, no, we're not calling the police. We'll say he had an accident. A fatal one. - On the stairs. Eric? Violaine? Eric? Where are you? This kid! He's stuck to our tails like flypaper, yeah! - Drop the kid at Petrovitch's. I'm calling an emergency staff meeting! Right? But he has 10 times more posters than me. So 10 times more money! - It's true the fight was unequal until now. But now you know he's a paedophile. It's a matter of public decency to get rid of such an odious Councillor. - Where's the evidence? Eric's testimony? A child? - But you saw Fred trying to kidnap Eric, Violaine and you? - What's the link between Fred and Gaspar? - There's no point! Gaspar is dead! I killed him! I killed that piece of shit! His wife and sister were there. They heard him say it was Fred who killed my little Guillaume. - Watch out. What if someone comes in and hears these secrets? - Tatiana knows everything now. - Tatiana is me. And I am her. - Thank you, you're my friends. My real friends. But what about Eric? He's in the hands of these two monsters. Maybe what happened to my little Guillaume will happen to him too. No! The most important thing now is Eric, right? All right, I got rid of a somewhat dangerous candidate. But a child's life comes first. Come on, I'm going to call Maxime. - What I like about Mathieu is his selflessness and his noble spirit. - We always knew he was like that. Gaspar has returned to his maker. - I know! - We know you know! - We don't know what we're going to do with the kid. - Is he here? - He's through there! The vice is tightening around us more and more. - They have no evidence to indict us. - No material evidence, no statements. - Except the child's which is questionable. - Like all children's statements. - Why did Fred kidnap him? - Gaspar's order. He went a little overboard but I do what I'm ordered to do. That's what I'm paid for. Not for asking questions. - We can't safely release the child. We can't kill him either. - We're not murderers. But what about Mathieu and Violaine? - Those two won't let it go. The woman is obsessed with her missing child. - Little Guillaume. It's better not to talk about him any more. - Well, there can be unpredictable accidents. - We have to keep Eric to get the other two. - In pure respect for the Law. - I'd like to know how. - You know very well I was put away for having loved children too much. I've spent years in jail. I made amends. I pleaded my case before the Criminal Court. Irreproachable conduct in prison. Now I've paid my debts. - You think so? - We can't do anything about what turns us on. - What matters is that I'm now Mr Clean, right? I'm a normal man—for now. Ah yes, you need to come right away. Because with these perverts, the child is in danger. I may have a solution but I don't know if it'll work. Yes, please, come right away! Goodbye! It's up to you to decide if you can trust him. If you don't, there's no other way to rescue Eric. - I'm ready to take all the risks. - And you? - You know me. - All right, I'll introduce you to him. Sit down Axel. - I prefer to stand. I 'll be more comfortable. - As you wish. - Maxime is a friend in whom I have an absolute trust. He told you what my past is? Maxime helped me a lot. I owe him everything. It was through him I made contact with the psychiatrists who looked after me, and then cured me. I'll be utterly grateful to him until my dying day. - Thank you Axel. - I swore to myself I'd never again see those I shared such infamous pleasures with. But they haven't forgotten me. I was, if I may say so, the Master of Ceremonies on these evenings. The playmaker. Through them I can easily find out where the next orgy with children will take place. And I should also find out where Eric is. - Are you sure? - I promise nothing, Madame. I'll do my best. - We'll see! I'll keep Maxime posted. He'll inform you. You do know that you can trust me? As much as I trust you. - I know, Axel! Goodbye. - Goodbye. Don't lose hope, don't despair! - Well? - Either he's sincere and it'll be worth it or he's a great actor, and he's the worst of the lot. - Come on, you did what you could. - A child's life is at stake! - Yes, the life of a child. But what are we going to do with the kid? The kid, maybe we could sell him to a house in Germany. It's risk free. - Germany? But how will he get there? - As registered luggage. - Not with me! - Even with a large premium for the risks? - A premium for large risks! - Yes, well they'll pay, a large amount. Better than a corpse, right? This is a weapon of war. I don't even have the right to own one myself. - I don't know how to use it. - Yes, but you know how to use a weapon for big game hunting. You'll learn fast how to use a machine gun. We'll go into the woods and I'll teach you. They've organized a special evening. - But they're not in the same place any more. This time they're on an island. And there's a lot of them. How are you going to free Eric? It's not possible! - Yes, but I think I'm quite capable of it, my dear. Over there. - He seems suspicious. - We'll take the small path. - I can't hear a thing for these fucking frogs. - Take care. - I'm going! - Here we go! He's entering the trap. Just like a mouse. Are you sure he can't do anything any more? 3-point lock, electronic closure. Without the remote, he can't open it. - Have you checked everything? - The rental agency is responsible, and they know their job. - Well done! Mathieu! Mathieu! Police! What's your name? - Macupek. - Babisko. - You speak French? No? Mathieu! Mathieu! - Answer please! Ah yes, I got it! I'm screwed. You are Mathieu's lawyer. That Petrovich is a real fucker. He tricked me, he got me. I'm a fool to have trusted him. I just have to understand. Like if someone kills me, I'd have to understand my murderer. It doesn't make sense! I believed in his friendship. I thought he had really changed. - But it was you who quoted Freud to me: One does not become perverse, one remains perverse. - I'll call him and tell him how disgusted I am. - But he'll play the innocent, and fool you again! - Once, yes, but not twice! Nothing on his landline, I'll try his mobile. - You're wasting your time! Allo? Axel? It's Maxime! What? I can't hear you! - He's at the range, I'm going there! - We're going there! Our friend's plan worked perfectly. - The gunsmith is screwed. Where's Eric? - At my house! - Do you know where he lives? - Yes yes. - Okay that's fine. SHOOTING RANGE You saw nothing, you heard nothing. It happened in a private club. There are no survivors, no witnesses. - No witnesses— - So goodbye, Maxime, and thank you. There you are! Listen to me. I can't stay with you. You have to go and see Maxime. He's a friend of Mathieu's. I can't stay. So you'll go to him. 12, rue de la Plâtrerie, next to the train station, OK? - But where are you going? - Look, you can tell Maxime that I have to be with my husband. Go on! Goodbye and hang in there! Oh my boy, my boy. Eric, how are you doing? - Great! So how was prison? - Well, you know, prison is no fun. Look at me there! Look at me, for God's sake, shit! - Stop! You're tearing down your own posters! - Yes yes, they've expired now! The elections are over, my friend! I was in jail while the elections were on. Politics, it's all shit!
