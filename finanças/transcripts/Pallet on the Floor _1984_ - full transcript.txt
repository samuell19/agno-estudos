[MUSIC PLAYING] Did you get a good look, Sam? Boy, that was the best sight I've ever seen. What's all that about? Some idiot has found a hole in the wall and those guys are lining up to get a good look at the lambs get their throats cut. To think I have to work with these guys. Well, I better get moving. Wife is waiting for me. I'll see you tonight. Give my love Sue now. How's it going, mate? How's it going, mate? Not too bad tonight. [INAUDIBLE] See you, mate. I hope your fitting went well. Aye, Sue? You'll need all the strength for settling. Oh, Sam. Those guys giving you a hard time? Thanks. Had to get out of the races. Family didn't get rained out today. Wish we had. Why? Did you loose? What's the matter? It's Miriam. What's happened now? We met Miriam on the bus and she was being so friendly. We didn't mind her joining us. And we picked a horse together and I was still in the queue when the race started. But you didn't get the bet on? She won't believe I didn't. And the horse won and she thinks I pocketed the winnings. That's a mug's game. Never put a bet on for anybody. Get yourself into too much trouble. I just wish now we hadn't invited her to the wedding. Don't worry about that. The whole town will be there whether you've invited them or not. Hey, slow down! Shit! Bloody maniac! [CAR ROARING] [POLICE SIRENS] Hold it right there, Marshal. [TRAIN HORN] Soon you'll be able to feel it move. I can hear him talking. Stop, you fool. It's too early. Shh. I tell you, I can hear it. What's he saying then? He says it's time. Time? Yeah. It's time we got married or he won't talk to me anymore. This is it. Ah! Top of the morning to you, mate. I smoke far too much. Have you been here all night? BASIL BEAUMONT-FOSTER: Samuel, don't just stand there. Open the door. When are you going to get the handles put back on? Why should I bother when I have friends like you to open doors for me? Picked them from the bosom of the earth this very morning, my dear chap. O'Keefe and I left the festivities rather late last night, so we decided to arrive here trifle early. [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] My father says that you have taken the affections of his granddaughter. [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] Embrace it with love and peace. [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] [INDIGENOUS SPEECH] You drunken pig. I don't know why I bother with you. Because you couldn't get him. [LAUGHTER] Excuse me, Sam. Next dance, aye. I mean, it is your wedding night. [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE]. Cut it out, Jack. What's the matter? All those night in the quarry, aye? It was a long time ago, Jack. Well, old time's sake then, aye? To you O'Keefe. [INAUDIBLE] you are. [INAUDIBLE]. Ah, yes. It looks like your man is after a bit of a dust up with Jack Voot. Hold on a minute. Bar tender, a dire emergency has arisen. If you please. Hang on there, mate. She can handle it. Romantical by the rubber gloves, Sam. You like something of the fist of it? Here. You just relax. The dance isn't finished. She doesn't want to dance anymore. She can speak for herself. I wouldn't do that if I were you. To donnybrook after. Step outside with me. I might save it till later, aye? Oh, any time. Come on now. Don't let a man like that spoil the wedding of the prettiest [INAUDIBLE] in [INAUDIBLE]. If the truth be told, I'd also dance with her myself. If I can have the pleasure, Mrs. Jamieson, with your husband's permission, of course. Piece of odious vermin is our Jack Voot. Beautiful. Beautiful indeed. And I invite any good white man or orange man or [INAUDIBLE],, with the exception of the all-red [INAUDIBLE] themselves. And may they rest in their matted graves. And we're now gathered together in holy matrimony to sing that one bold hymn. (SINGING) Oh rambling for roaming, for football, for sporting, for drinking black water-- [COUGHING] --and all your days rolled and your finance a-jovial. [CHOCKING] [COUGHING] Oh, Jesus, Basil. O'Keefe. O'Keefe's dead. What? Dead. Last night he had a seizure. Sam, what's happened? It's O'Keefe. He died last night. [BIRDS CRYING] [INDIGENOUS SINGING] I'm not saying he had been a prize fighter and I'm not saying he hadn't, but the Voots thought he had. He was, I reckon. Never had a roughhouse fighter in the jaw look him straight in the eye and belt him in the gut. He is to say the Irish were like the Maoris for shellfish. That's why they had such good heads of hair. You understand that? [INAUDIBLE] The copsters are all gone to O'Keefe's funeral. And what? Well, you employed all those bloody Maories. Bloody Maories? I employ all those bloody Maories to protect our access rights to work the quarries on their land. God damn it. They're land! And if you keep trying to mess with that woman, we'll lose it all. Jesus Christ, you're going to murder yourself. Now, you stay away from those Jamieson's. You hear me? Or we'll have all the Maories in the district on our heads and no land to work at all. That's right, Jack. You didn't stick her enough, aye? Oh. Still the little darky's well stuffed now though. Now, you stay away from that Jamieson fella or we will lose those quarries. Do you hear me, boy? Do you hear me? Jamieson's order for firewood. You want to deliver it? How you getting on with that new bloke, that traffic cop? What's his name? Henderson. Why they stationed a traffic cop in this town is beyond me. Oh, come on, mate. Times are changing. You can't be expected to handle the whole thing by yourself. Of course, the only time I've ever seen him he's always got some [INAUDIBLE] in the car, kind of a driver's license. Riders license should be more like it. Yeah, well, I better get on with those [INAUDIBLE].. Plenty of beers in the fridge, mate. Help yourself. Hold it right there, buddy. [GUN CLICKING] Evening, Marshal. - Thanks, Groucho. - Cheers, mate. - And take Sue home, will you? - Yeah, sure. No problem. Are you sure you don't want to come in? No, I'd rather go home. You'll be all right there? Yeah, I'll be OK. Aye, fucking move it! So your baby's father up and died on you, did he? Please hurry. Serves you not. So how about the money you owe me? Black tart. It was just like Jim Harris, aye? He hit the deck right alongside me. Those guys are working in freezing chambers. It thickens the blood. Working at those temperatures, got to get you sooner or later. Be crying and you'll be a next, Sam. I confess I sympathize. And yet, how curious that we who trade in blood and death should be so disconsolate. It's enough to make a black morbid. Let us drink until the horrors come, lest sober we go mad. (SINGING) When the roll is called up yonder-- It is good. (SINGING) Is called up yonder. When the roll is called up yonder. Aye, that new Mrs. of yours, she going to fork out that money? She walked off my [INAUDIBLE] at the [INAUDIBLE].. That horse came in and paid $86. Listen, Stan, you weren't there and neither was I. Sue said you didn't get the bid on. That's what she says. And that's good enough for me. Well, it's not good enough for me. You tell her to get that $43 together or else it's going to be trouble. Just remember, I've got mates. I'm going to get some cigarettes. How'd you feel if I ran off with it? How would you like to feel diddled? Oh, listen, Miriam, I'm sick and tired of hearing about it. Well, maybe you are. But I'm going to tell you something that'll change your mind about your pure, innocent, little wife. Going to have a kid, is she? And silly old Sammy thinks he's the daddy. What? Your mate that dropped dead knew more about that kid than you did. It wasn't just Shellfish O'Keefe that was dipping into. Too. And how would you know about that? Didn't those two go hunting the beach and river often as they could? Nice sand hills out there, Sam. O'Keefe was my mate. Sue thought the world of him. Sure. Sure. Enough to lie in her back with her legs open. Think about it, Sammy. O'Keefe wasn't like that. He wasn't interested in women in that way. You show me a man that isn't interested. Christ, Miriam. Well, you think it over. But before you boot the bitch out, get my dough. What's that? Don't you think you've had enough, Sam? You're walking nine. You must have given Brendon some wake. What's the matter? As if you didn't know. I'm damned if I do. I just want a drink. I helped to make it, didn't I? Yeah, and you've got something in your belly that I didn't help make. What? Out in the sand hills with O'Keefe, aye? It's no more my baby than the full bloody moon. I don't understand you. Are you saying this is O'Keefe's baby and not yours? That's just what I'm bloody well saying. O'Keefe never laid a hand on me and you know it. I can see it's no good talking to you. No need for you to go, Sam. This is your home just like it's your baby. Now your slut of a wife will go back to her people. No, Sue. You don't trust me. So that's that. Love and trust go together, Sam. Sue. It's Miriam, isn't it? She's been at you with that vicious tongue of hers. I can see that. I'm sorry. Do you forgive me? Please forgive me. Hello, Joe. You haven't forgotten that firewood I asked you to deliver, have you? You might be warm tonight, but you'll be cold later on. Yeah, there'll be more sweaty crutches and runny noses around here tonight. You'll get your firewood. Can you fill it up, please, lad? Jamieson wants his firewood. Why don't you deliver it now? I think it's a very good idea. [HORN IN DISTANCE] Why you had to marry her, I'll never know. Leave it out, Miriam. Who is she anyway? A bloody half-cast. She's my wife. Fathered by some fly-by-night night salesman in a flashy car. Not even his own. Good enough to get him to share. She's still got a crush on him. A trifle enamored, I should say. Enamored, more like. You was going to marry me. It's all water under the bridge, Miriam. I say, Samuel, why not flutter the old shoe leather for this old chap. Oh, shove off, Lord Muck. Tap dance. He doesn't want to. Do you, Sammy? I'll tell you what, why don't we just have an early night, aye? Excellent suggestion, [INAUDIBLE].. I feel at this stage of the proceedings I should invite you all to my home. Alas, I have no home. Why don't we go to my place? We might even get a bite to eat. Sounds great. - Bloody good idea. - Excellent. - I'll get a flagon, aye? - Pay you back later. Veronica, give me the hat. Come on. Hey. Veronica, give me the hat. Veronica, give me the hat. Give me the hat. Come on. Fuck you. [BOTTLES CLANKING] I see the long arm of the Lord is about to reach into mysterious places. Didn't take him long to get into a [INAUDIBLE].. Lay down. Lay down. [ENGINE STARTS] Don't you go off without me, Sam. It should have been you and me, you know that. You're all up the shoot, Miriam. [INAUDIBLE] finds its own level and you'll be dragged back to the mat. Don't tell me she's never suggested it. Yeah, but only when the roof leaks. Now, listen, Miriam, go home, leave me and Sue alone. You've got Stan. But it'd be different with you and me, Sam. It's not too late. Lots of people start a new life, but not with a black at their heels. [CLANKING] Sam? That you, Sam? A bloke could do with a drink after and finding his way up that path of yours. You'd better go, Jack. Oh, come on, girl. Just a drink. Please, go. That's where you'll end up, back at the park, eating dry chalk and sleeping on the floor. Come on, Sam. Just a kiss. I'm so lonely. You know you want me. Why, Sam, you're so passionate. I don't care what you do. I know we could be happy. All right, yes. Right here. Crazy. You're bloody mad. Sam. Sam. Oh. [GASP] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] You hurting my baby! [GRUNTING] (SINGING) [INAUDIBLE] You fucking slut! [SCREAMING] Calm down, you bitch! Sam. Sam! Sam. Sam. [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] No, shit. He is a goner. The pulse, Spud. Try the pulse. Dead as a doornail, Bas. Roll him over. I'm afraid so. Get the Marshal! Let us not be hasty now. I fear the police may complicate matters. An accident, Bas. Well, nobody meant to kill him. Get the Marshal, Basil. There's nothing else we can do. Samuel, why don't you take Susan back to the house? Let us-- let us get him behind the wheel. I'm sure he'll be happier there. Come on, Shorty. [INAUDIBLE]. You see, if we go to the constabulary, he'll probably [INAUDIBLE]. 3 and 1/2, you mean. 3 and 1/2? 3 and 1/2 to 1. Even if the police do believe us, we have the boots to think of. And that's not our place and thought. Bas. Good thinking, Spud. You have genius concealed under that hat of yours. Now, come on. Push, push, push, push. Over the railway line, through the fence into the river. The titan. Heads up. What the hell are you doing? Right to the edge, lads. Oh, it's suck. Oh, shit, it's not going to go. Never say die, chaps. [CAR APPROACHING] All right, what's going on here? Well, isn't anybody going to tell me? We're on our way to Sam's. And you are? Um, my good friend [INAUDIBLE] McGhee, known to all as "Spud." Please, officer, let me explain. I'm Basil Beaumont Foster. We were, as my good friend here was telling you, returning from the hotel on our way to to Samuel's here for supper when this truck came thundering towards us. So you're not in the truck. Oh, Good Lord, no, no, no, no, no, no. Pedestrians. Pedestrians. We naturally assumed it would reduce speed. It didn't. And what you'll see here is the result. The maniac tried to kill us. Probably the dog pissing in the snow. But where's the driver? Ah, asleep in the cab here. Overindulgence, intoxicated. Do you know who he is? Voot-- Officer Jack Voot. Christ, this man needs a doctor. Bring him into my car. Ah, it occurs to me officer that, um, we should remove this obstruction. So with your kind permission I shall convey Mr. Voot in his truck to the hospital, thereby solving all the problems at the one time, if you see what I mean. Right. So you follow me? Excellent suggestion, officer. Right. Listen, get down. Listen, when we hit town I want you to do the disappearing trick. I got to sort this out. Jack Voot's had an accident. Oh my her-- Veronica, cut it out. Christ. [ENGINE STARTS] [TRAIN HORN] [BRAKES SCREECHING] Basil. Is that you? [INAUDIBLE]? What in the hell happened? [INAUDIBLE] came too. What the hell do you mean? He woke up. [INAUDIBLE] came too. Grabbed me arm. Engine stalled. Failed to respond on the starter. Oh, golly, what a mess? Bloody hell. Was anyone hurt? Are you telling me that man came too? Correct, officer. Then he lunged at me. I'm lucky to be here. Oh, fucking hell. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] [INAUDIBLE]. Why? There's been an accident. It's Jack Voot. All right, come in. MAN 1: The hell is it? It's the Marshal. Go back to bed, love. I'll get something to eat when I get to work. We'll never be able to fix this place up. We'll have to move out to the park. I'm not living in any Maori village. I'm a Maori, Sam. I'm not going back to the mat. No but to anymore. It'll be OK, as long as we stick to Basil's story. I'll get the lads to help and fix it up. It's not just the house, Sam. It's the baby. We'd be so much happier living at the park. Back to the mat, aye? It's just what everyone's waiting for. I can just hear them now. Sam, I was so happy as a child living the way we did. I just want that for our child too. Look, we'll-- we'll get somewhere to live in town. Everything will be OK, Sue. It's tough enough as it is without having to pay rent. You have a look around town. I'm sure there'll be something. I have to go to work today. Things have to look normal. I'm so scared. It'll be all right, Sue. It'll be all right. Stan. How does it feel to be a murderer? What? Smashing flagons over Voot's head and putting the boot in. I didn't think frost had the guts to push that truck on the line, but he did just to save your bacon. You don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I do. Miriam seen it all. Who'd believe her. Her word against five of us. I was there too. Oh, you bloody liar. Who will Joe Voot believe, you or me? Listen, you killed Jack and tried to cover it up. You could've wrecked that train. Throw the book at the lot of you. Marshal will be running around in circles. And Miriam and me were the key witnesses. You wouldn't. That's right. I wouldn't. But just get your Mrs. to pay that money she owes Miriam and sign over that land of yours to us. That land's everything we've got. I suppose Tomlinson will be the lawyer to handle it. He'd know damn well I wouldn't give it away. Let him think I'm paying it off. Don't get any bright ideas. It's that land or I go to the cops, and just for good measure, Joe Voot. You're a bastard, Breen. Slimy, blackmailing bastard. Voot tried to rape Sue. Raped her, my backside. You just got home too early. That's all. Coitus interruptus. I'll see you down at the pub tonight and we'll sort out that appointment with Tomlinson. [HORN] You hear that, Voot? Yeah, nothing like a dinner, aye? [INAUDIBLE] fucking [INAUDIBLE].. - Jesus, what a piss-off, eh? - What? You're short a penny? Hello, my lads, that's it. Only the foreman and some of the longest serving employees are to be retained. As for us, the season terminates forthwith. No holiday pay? 10 years I've been in this place and they still haven't put me on permanent. You must be keeping the wrong company, old chap. Now to an even more disturbing problem. It seems, from what Samuel has told us, we are to employ a colloquialism up the creek without a paddle. Well, it's either prison or Sam loses land. Grim though it is the fact must be faced. You haven't got any stick we can fall back on, have you, Basil? You refer to the fabled Beaumont Foster carburetor, no doubt? Not a success, old boy. And just between you and me, and no one in his right mind would have ever bought one. My dear father in England owns the only ones in existence. Skulls of them. It took a tank full of petroleum to circumnavigate the village square. We thought you were getting royalties from it. Isn't it obvious? My dear truncated friend you see before you, a remittance man without a remittance. Truncated. Sawn off, Shorty. Short. Right you are. Outside. I want a word with you. Remain here, chaps. Does he want all of us? Hell does he want? About the accident, I suppose. Well, I'm not going until I get my pay. It seems our presence is required in the Marshal's office by one Detective Sergeant Waterworth, the sleuth from the big city, who is conducting inquiries into the unfortunate accident that befell Jack Voot. What? Now? We've got to get changed. We want our pay. Lads, all has been arranged. We can pick up our remunerations, et cetera, and the good Marshal will chauffeur us there. [INAUDIBLE]. [KNOCKING] Right. You. Here. You might as well take a seat, gentlemen. Excuse me, Constable, but is this likely to take long? Well, it's up to you. I see. Thank you. Rather we were in the Boozer. [CLANKING] [SNAP] - This the drivers? - Yes. That's right, sir. Beaumont. Beaumont Foster. Basil Beaumont Foster, Sergeant, from-- The freezing works. Right. Well, Mr. Basil Beaumont Foster, why don't you tell me in your own words exactly what happened? Well, on the night in question we were returning from the hotel en route to Sam-- Jamieson's. The cottage up the hill. Yes. We were walking on the roadway because, well, the foot-- The foot path is a disgrace to the council. And this drunken bastard came driving straight at us all over the road. Exactly. Well, I don't know, Sergeant. I think you should have made three carbon copies of the first one, could've saved us all a lot of time. I don't know why I bother. I really don't know why I bother. Why don't you just piss off? You can sign that later. Popular bloke this Voot, wouldn't you say? Well, I suppose, like most of us, Sergeant, he had his admirers and his detractors. A lot of people would be pleased to see him dead, I should think. What I'd like to know is what he was doing after he left the pub at about 8:45. They tell me he got himself into a bit of a mess between 8:45 and 9:30, say? Truck stalled, did it? He came to and grabbed the wheel. The wheel? My foot slipped. Off the wheel? The accelerator, Sergeant. Still you managed to jump clear, so you're lucky to be alive. You could say that. Yes. Quite a trick there. We'll be in touch. Goodbye. By the way, weren't you also with Mr. O'Keefe when he died? Mr. O'Keefe, Detective Sergeant, was a very dear friend of mine. Don't leave town. [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, come on, Spud. One more. I'll get another round. No, I'm going fishing. See you, Sue. I'll be at the wharf. SUE JAMIESON: Bye, bye, Spud. MAN 2: Time again? Yeah, filling up, Amos. Jamieson. Jamieson. I'll ring Tomlinson, Tuesday tomorrow. All right. That's 2 o'clock here and 2:30 there, so don't you try anything. Remember? Don't try anything. Thanks, Amos. What did the illustrious Stanley Breen have to say? He's arranged an appointment with Tomlinson at 2:30. Meeting at 2 o'clock here. You can't give us a lift, can you? Of course, dear boy. Does Susan know about this? If I only had the heart. Have you found a place to live? Yeah, the old place above Ted [INAUDIBLE]'s's place. It's got bedding and we stay there tonight. $15 a week. It's going to be living hand-to-mouth. Why don't you go to the past, Samuel? Susan would be much happier there. Yeah, I know. I would as well. You know, Basil, a man would feel a bit of a failure if he couldn't support his own wife. What the hell does it matter? The old Maori had the right idea. This is a rat race. When you're too old to work you're poor if you haven't saved every bauble and lived miserably when you were young enough to enjoy yourself. You could have a life of contentment down at the park. People would say we're going back to the mat. People-- what people say is of no consequence, Sammy. People are all scratching a living in this foul world of ours. Scraping and scrimping for what? Yeah. It's work, work, work and then you're dead. I think deep down all of us would like a pallet on the floor. I envy your opportunity, my dear friend. Come on, Spud. [GRUNTING] Just stay on your feet, will you? I'll slog off that [INAUDIBLE].. Get up, will you? You got a problem, Miriam? Oh, don't worry, Joe. There's a taxi coming. We'll be right-- - You get the taxi. I'll take him home. [GRUNTING] A taxi's coming. You don't have to worry, Joe. There's a taxi coming. I've ordered it. It should be here any minute. What's the deal with Jamieson? I don't know what you're talking about. What's the deal, Miriam. - I don't know any details, Joe. - Listen, you bitch. I heard him talking in the pub about some lawyer. Get a bulldozer and clear out all this gaffe. What the fuck are you talking about? Shut up, Stan. Don't you say anything. Joe, he's drunk. [INAUDIBLE] between 'em. And [INAUDIBLE]. Get out. Just get out. [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE], don't you? [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE],, where's that long streak of palmy piss-fuster gone? Johnny. Johnny. Foster! Sheesh. What do you want? - Bastard Foster. - He's not here. Bull shit. You got his mates in there. - Oh, fuck off, Voot. - Yeah, piss off, Voot. Give him to me, [INAUDIBLE]. Piss off! Oh, shit. Right, you fucking runt. Where's your long palmy mate? He's gone fishing. Goofer! Foster. Come out before I shorten this runt even further. Shit. He's not at the hut. He's not at the pisser. So where is he? I said, where is he? Fishing. There's a wharf. You lied to me. Come on. Get in. One little squeak from you, runt, and I'll squash you like a bug. [ENGINE STARTS] McGhee, where's that long [INAUDIBLE] palmy-pissed Foster? Down here. [INAUDIBLE] Foster. Foster. [GRUNTING] Looking for me, old chap? [SCREAM] Jesus, can he swim? Apparently not. God, I need a drink. Come on, Basil. I fear our predicament is far too acute for comfort. What we need is some-- some angling gear, some Voot angling gear. Oh, yeah-- Oh, shit. There's some in his truck. Yeah, hang on, I'll get it. Excellent, excellent. Why was he here? Why was Joe looking for me? All I could find in the back. Excellent. Excellent, Spud. Excellent. It will now appear, to any suspicious minds, that Joe has been fishing here. He's a little stewed. Drops his bag into the cargo there and in climbing down to retrieve it, falls into the water and drowns. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'll get you. Oh, Christ, I just hope we get away with all of this. Aren't you going to drop me at the flat first, Basil? It's just along there. There's something I want to talk to you about first, Sue. Perhaps we should have a drink first. We'll pick up the Breens. The Breens? Yeah. See you in a minute. It's about the land, Sue. I didn't tell you before because, well, I thought you were miserable enough. Miriam was there that night. She saw everything, the fight, the train crash. She told Stanley. Amos going to the funeral? Indeed he is. And this establishment closes in 20 minutes, so drink up and be married. [INAUDIBLE] planting Jack Voot will be dragging the wharf for his brother. Joe Voot? They found his bag. He must've been fishing the incoming tide and slipped. Joe Voot. [INAUDIBLE] thousands wouldn't. Others have drowned there. Won't be the last. How true. Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep. But what were those words from his palsied lips? A little birdie has been whispering in Joe Voot's ear, or to be more precise, a slobbering inebriant. Speak of the devil. What are you doing here, Foster? Now chemist in such questionable shape. You wish to go to [INAUDIBLE],, do you not? With Jamieson, not you. Well, I come equipped with motor vehicle to convey you there. The taxicab, unfortunately, is busy with the funeral arrangements. Yeah, I thought-- Her hair stands up like worms in excrement. Shit. Yeah, well, the car's outside. Come on, let's get weaving. - What's the hurry? It's only quarter to. First, I must drop Susan off at her new residence, then I shall convey you to Tomlinson. Christ, what happened to you, mate? Oh, fell down the bank back at Johnny's place last night. Jeez, I could get a drink. It's been a shit of a week. Here, old chap, have mine. What a piece of junk. It'll serve its purpose admirably, madam. Samuel and Susan, in the front. Basil, [INAUDIBLE]. You leave everything to me, dear Susan. We're going to the park first. We'll make other arrangements later. Come on. We'll be late for Tomlinson. All in good time, Mr. Breen. All in good time. Foster, hold it right there, buddy. Now, where do you think you're going? I have business to attend to, Sergeant. Detective Waterworth would like a word with you. I'm afraid it will have to wait till later, Sergeant. Don't you think you got some explaining to do? Not only were you in the vehicle the night Jack Voot was killed, but we've got it on good authority that Joe Voot went looking for him and suddenly disappeared. My dear, dear Sergeant Larkman, as I've already explained, I'm a little busy right now, but I shall be only too happy to call on the good detective later. That's two deaths in the one week. He thinks there's something fishy going on. Say that again. Chumps away! You bloody maniac. He'll run us all in. Marshal, think you've got a bit of a flatty there. Right. Come on. Come on. Come on. You out. You two, come with me. - What the hell's going on? - You, move over. I need this car for police business. What about my driver's license? I'm sorry, love. We can go for your rider's license when we get back. You dick! Hey, take it easy. It'd be pity for O'Keefe to leave no family. Haven't you done enough already? I'm just beginning. Yeah. Well, you live with it. We'll leave it here, Samuel. You can unload it later. All right, let's get it off. Thank you, Basil. You're such a good friend to us. The pleasure's all mine, dear lady. How long's this palaver going on for? Ready your bags, Foster. Have you no soul, madam? Soul? Forget about soul. Let's get moving. When your turn comes to meet your maker, I doubt you'll be in such a hurry. Come, Samuel. [POLICE SIREN] Can't this heap of nuts and bolts go any faster, Foster? You're always in a hurry, Mrs. Breen.
