(eerie, ominous music) (exotic, fast-paced drums) (heavy breathing) - (gasps) Oh! She's returning. (breathes hard) We have to be ready. (baby gurgles softly, mother coos to baby) - Good, thank you. - [Mother] There we are. - And you. - That's my wife, Sarah. - [Sarah] Hi. - Mrs. Mathers. - [Sarah] Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hello. - And this is Beth. - [Sarah] This is Beth. - (chuckles) Welcome to your new home. (fax machine beeps) - Very good. Do we have to have that hideous machine in our living room? - This hideous machine is going to ensure that I get away from the office early. - Are you sure? Looks like a hotline to the devil to me. (scoffs softly) - What's she doing? You are such a child. Right. (squeals and giggles) (both laughs) - Where do you want this one, mate? - In here's fine. (Beth babbles) I was thinking we should get a nanny, someone to help you out around the house. - I don't need any help. - I didn't say you needed help. Just that you'd get to spend more quality time with Beth. - You know, if you spent a little less time with the great evil and a little more time with us, that's all the help I need. (knocks on door) - Ah, just in case, I'll call the firm later and have them send someone out. - [Woman] Hello. - [Sarah] Hi. - I'm collecting for Doctor Allen's cancer charity. I wondered if you'd like to make a donation? - Oh, sure. How much is usual? - Say, 10 pounds. - How much is 10 pounds? - About 15 dollars. Hi. - Can we make a donation to a cancer charity? - Sure. - I can write you a receipt. - [Lincoln] That's okay. Here, give me that, I'll fill it out. - Well, listen here, here's my card. I work at the Maritime Museum. If you're interested in joining us, give me a call, yeah? - Thanks. Em. (chuckles) (dark, ominous music) (exotic drums) (cups crash) - (gasps) God! Oh God, Frank. She's threatening us. (takes shuddering breaths) - All right, all right. (ominous music) - [Woman] Good morning, Lincoln. - Hi. - [Woman] It's nice to have you here full time now. - It's nice to be here. How's mein fueherer? - He's in a bad mood. (Lincoln sighs) - [Man] Lincoln. - [Lincoln] Roger, good morning. Have a seat. You settled in? Family okay? - [Lincoln] Yeah, couldn't be better. - I want you to get up to speed with UMCS in Broadband Mobile. Got a department meeting in about five minutes. I'll announce it there. - You know that my background is in fixed, right? - We don't have a problem, though, do we? - [Lincoln] (scoffs) No. - Good. (crunching, squelching) (footsteps approach) - Hi. Can I help you? - Hi. I'm Kelly. A home help? - Oh, I'm sorry. Have you been waiting long? - Not really. Shall I give you a hand? - Oh, thanks. (Beth fusses) - Did you bring your resume and your references and stuff? - Yeah, it's all in here. (water drips softly) - Yeah, it's great. I'm really gonna like it here, Dad. We've an au pair. She's nice. Oh sure, sure. Yeah, just let us get it straightened out first. Yeah, they gave him some big project, and, you know, he just wants to break the back of it while he can. Yeah. Take care. Bye. (metallic banging) - Jeff! Come have a look at this. Jeff! - What's up? - [Worker] Look at this. What do you recon it is? - Don't know. We find out. (slow, suspenseful music) (door bangs) - [Worker] Nice one. Now you've blown a fuse or something. - [Jeff] Boo! - Idiot. (Jeff laughs) - [Jeff] (mumbles to himself) Oh, shit! Ah, coo, my head. - [Worker] Ah, that'll teach you to keep messing about. - [Jeff] Oh, it really hurts, man. I got water in my eyes, it might be stagnant or something. (gasps) (door opens) Just my luck. (gasps) - Oh my God, what happened? - He's hit his head. - Well, should I call 911? - You mean 999? No, it'd be quicker if I went and took care of it myself. We'll see you on Monday. - Oh, Okay. (worker gasps) I hope he's all right. (door slams shut) - Kelly, would you look after Beth for a minute? - Of course, I'd love to. - Hey, silly (whispers to Beth). (eerie music) (hollow raps) (hollow raps) (hollow raps) (loud crash) (electronic beeping) (Kelly whispers to Beth) - Hi. You must be Kelly. - Hello. - Hi. Lincoln. - Hi. (Beth gurgles) - You settling in okay? Sarah's not overworking you? - No. - [Lincoln] Good. Where is she? - Sarah? I've not seen her. I thought she must have popped out or something. - (chuckles) On the one Friday I've come home to get an early start on the weekend? Right, well, I'm just gonna go slip into something more comfortable. - Sarah? (three sharp raps) It's me. Sarah? God! You almost gave me a heart attack. - Good I haven't forgiven you for last night yet. Come with me. - I'm not dressed to go into cellars. I'm wearing a $500 suit. Sarah, what have you been doing? (eerie music) Oh my God. (inhales sharply) (exclaims softly) God! - (chuckles) Are you okay? Don't you think it's fascinating? But, what do you think it is? - Sarah, I don't care. Just call the police and have them come get it. - I think it's some kind of religious tomb. - Really? - Maybe London won't be so bad after all. - Sarah. - This could be historically important. - Or the previous owners were psychopaths. Look, I know you feel like all your birthdays have come at once, but don't you have enough to do? - I have Kelly now, haven't I? - I was thinking more about Beth. - (scoffs) Right. You know, maybe I would like to find out more about this. And maybe you could play more of a role in our daughter's upbringing? You have your fun, let me have mine. - I don't know, Sarah, what if these people were murdered? - Well, if they were, it was a very long time ago. - I think we should pay the builders to take them away. - Look. They don't come back til Monday, and I'm curious. (cell phone rings) - Hi. Lincoln. Hello, Roger. No, no, no, it's fine. Yeah, no, no, I told them that would be fine. No, no, no. I think that's what they said. Roger, can you hang on a sec? I can't talk about this now. Do whatever you want. Yeah, go ahead. (soft pop music) - Morning, Kelly. Have you seen Sarah? - She's in the cellar. What's down there that's so interesting all of a sudden? - Nothing. You going out tonight? - Yeah. Do you like the color? - Yeah. Very purple. - Purple is this year's black. It's supposed to be sexy. - Is that right? Gonna have to give me some, then. (knocks) Sarah, it's me. Open up. (door opens) - Did you get the wood? - I should've been playing 18 holes with Roger. - [Sarah] I wonder who they are. - [Lincoln] I don't know and I don't care. Come on, give me a hand. Perfect. (Lincoln scoffs) Whoever made this damn hole meant for it not to be found. - [Sarah] Yeah. (knocking on door) - I'm sorry to disturb you. MayCan I come in? - [Lincoln] Can I help you? - I've got some difficult news. A soul is in danger. - Look buddy, we're not religious. - Please! It's vital that I speak to you. - If you don't leave, I'll call the police. - Sir, your family is in danger. Your wife is possessed. - (chuckles softly) Sure she is. - Look, put this under your wife's pillow when you make love to her. - Look, buddy, put this under your wife's pillow, or buy yourself a lap dance. Now get off my property. - It's vital that I talk to you. She has your wife's body. She is a warrior! (TV voices in background) - Could you go get some milk from the corner store? - That's why we had Kelly. - Well, it's gone sour. (sniffs softly) - It's not sour. - [Sarah] Hm? - It's not sour. - [Sarah] (scoffs) Where'd you get that? - In the fridge, where we normally keep the milk. - Stop it. I checked the milk earlier. It was sour and I threw it away. - Well, it's fine now. - It was definitely sour. Well, will you go to the store anyway? Beth could do with some fresh air when she wakes up, and we need more cereal. - Should I check the cereal first? Okay, I'm going. (loud burp) (laughs quietly) - Lincoln? - Hm? - I keep putting stuff down and not remembering where I put it. - Hm. Everybody does that. It's normal. - I didn't do it before London. - Good. - You're not even listening to me. - I am. - Forget about it. - [Lincoln] Sarah. - Forget it. (buzzing) Answer it. - Lincoln. No. No, it's not a problem. Um-hm. Yeah. (ominous music) Yeah. Yeah, they're coming in tomorrow. Well, we'll have to see what they say about it. No. Sue said she was gonna take care of it. (train roars) (water rushes) (metallic clang) (metallic bang) (door slams) - That looks painful. Glad it wasn't more serious. - He'll live. - Oh, Sarah and I covered that hole over on the weekend so there weren't any more accidents. - Shouldn't have troubled yourself. We'd have done that this morning. What was it, buried treasure? - No. Unfortunately, just an empty hole. - Could have been my grave Friday. - [Lincoln] Well, thank God it wasn't. Good morning. - You all right? - Never better. - All right, come on then, Jeff, let's get with it. - I'll see you tonight. - Wait. - This phone was a top five franchise position in all its chosen global markets. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. Having one of those days. - [Roger] No problem. - Lincoln Mathers, meeting communications. - [Roger] This is Magnus Erikson. - Nice to meet you. - [Lincoln] Nice to meet you, Magnus. - [Roger] This is Lars Swenson. - [Lincoln] Lars. - Pleased to meet you. - [Magnus] Oh, thank you, Thank you. Have one of mine. - Thank you. - You know our business? - I do. I'll just get some coffee. - Okay, to quickly summarize then, our goal is to deliver to you joined up solutions which integrate together the requirements for your corporate and financial strategy, your capital requirements, and your shareholder value. (Beth babbles) (knock) - Oh, the door. - [Woman] Hi, I'm Fiona. We met last week. - [Sarah] Oh yes, of course. Hi. - [Fiona] I've brought something I wanna show you. - Just made a brew, do you want one? - Oh, yeah, thanks. - Sarah, cup of tea? - Thank you, Kelly. Come in, sit down. - You're having some renovations done, then? - Yeah. Lincoln thinks he's gonna get a study, and we'll let him think that for now. - Have you taken anything nice? - What? - [Fiona] The camera. I just wondered if you'd taken any nice pictures. - Oh. No. This is just some work I'm doing for someone. - I wanted to give you this. It's about the house. - Huh. - [Kelly] Tea's up. - [Sarah] Please, Kelly. - Fancy a biscuit? - [Sarah] I can't. Nuts. I have an allergy. - Oh, I'm sorry. But do you mind if I have one? - [Sarah] Sure. I shouldn't anyway. - Can you eat them? - Yeah, I love those ones. Thanks. - Kelly, don't sit on the table. - [Fiona] Those are photocopies from a local newspaper from 1902. - "Merchant and daughter die in cellar inferno"? - Yeah, and it was in this house, right where the builders are now. - Great. Thanks, Fiona. That's more information than I need. - Have the builders found anything yet? Only, one had a right nasty cut on his head Friday. - No, they haven't, Kelly. Spooky stuff, huh? - These are actually good luck symbols. - Do you believe in all this stuff? - Can we put this away? - I'm sorry, I just thought you'd be interested. - Well, it's interesting, but... - Have you been feeling all right? - [Sarah] Yes. - Only, if you start to feel funny, yeah, I'm here to help you. - What are you talking about, Fiona? - Listen here. I want you to think of me as a friend. - Okay, thanks. - (scoffs) I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna have to get going. I know it sounds a bit weird. But if anything happens, you have my card. Just call me. - Okay. (rasping sounds) - Oh, something's not quite right, but she seems pretty normal, yeah? I'm gonna head home. Let me know what you want me to do next. See you both later. - Maybe we need to take a little more direct action. - I think we wait a day or so until they're more ready to turn to us. (crunches) No, thanks. Do you have to crunch those? Why can't you suck them? (eerie music) (music intensifies) (Beth giggles) - Guys, would either of you like a cup of hot tea? - That'd be smashing. Bit nippy, eh? - Do you take sugar? - Two, please. - You want a drink, Kelly? - No, thanks. - Kelly? - Yeah? - Could you post this on your way home tonight? - [Kelly] Sure. It's a nice card. It's to your dad? - Yeah. (ominous music) - It's definitely a come-on. She's well up for it. - (scoffs) You don't stand a chance. - Bollocks, I've had plenty of posh birds. - You're better off trying the nanny. (chuckles) - Well, I'm no cradle snatcher. That's your department. - Once. (bag smacks on counter) (eerie, suspenseful music) (soft crunching) (soft crunching) - Kelly? Have you been in the kitchen? - No. (kettle whistles) (crunching) (white noise) (fork scrapes) - It's screwed. Call someone in the morning and have it sorted out. Wow. At least we know about our dead bodies in the basement. Hm? - I guess. - Have you found out how much it's all worth yet? - Not yet. - You all right? - Don't worry. (eerie music) - Sarah, where do we keep the paper towels? Sarah? Sarah, what are you doing? (gasps) (gasps and cries) Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, sh. Forget about it, forget about it. It never happened. - Lincoln, I'm scared. Something's not right. I wanna go home. I wanna move tonight. - We're not going to move tonight. - You promised that things were gonna be different, and it's exactly the same. - What? - You're not at home. - I'm here, aren't I? - How was I supposed to know I was gonna land this big project as soon as I arrived? - This project, there's always gonna be some project. - It's going to be different, I promise. Just cut me some slack. - I'm tired of cutting you slack. - I don't like it here, I wanna go home. - We've uncovered something that I wish to God we never had. I want my dad. - You got me. - All right. There's something wrong with me. - Sarah. You're just adjusting to a new life. - (scoffs) Who's life, Lincoln? - Look. Why don't you go take a bath, and I'll tidy up down here. - I still wanna move. - Okay. We'll discuss it again in the morning. Come on. Wanna take something up with you? - What? - Small thank you for being my wife? (paper rustles) Thank you. (eerie music) Are you ready for me? - You look fantastic. There's just one problem. I have to finish reading this by the morning. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Hon, stop fooling around. Ow! - Faggot! Come and get it! - Are you crazy? Do you know what you've just done? - Come and get it! - Stop fucking around. (Sarah laughs) - Faggot. Faggot, faggot, fucking no-dick loser. You're pathetic. If you can't keep me satisfied, then I'll have to find someone who will. (ominous music) (speaks foreign launguage) If you won't fuck me, then I'll have to find someone else who will. (paper rustles, Lincoln gags) - Sarah? - Go back to your document. (Lincoln sighs) - [Lincoln] I'm going to call a doctor and ask him-- - I"m not going to see a shrink, Lincoln. You can't make me. - [Lincoln] I'm not going to make you do anything. - [Sarah] Don't talk to me like I'm my mother. - [Lincoln] I'm not. I wasn't even... - Don't lie to me. (phone rings) You try to make me see a shrink, I swear to God, I'm gonna leave you. - [Lincoln] Okay, all right. It's okay. - Okay. - But I think maybe we should move. We'll call the realtor today and tell him to find somewhere else. - I don't like it here anymore. - [Lincoln] I know. I promise, I'll get us moved. (soft knock) - I'm sorry. The builder's called to say they've got another job on today. They'll be back again tomorrow. - Kelly, Sarah's not feeling very well this morning. You gonna be okay looking after Beth? - Of course. Don't worry about a thing. I'll look after both of them. - Thanks, you're a star. Oh, Kelly, would you be all right to stay over a few nights if we needed you to? - [Kelly] I'd love to. - Maybe you could bring an overnight bag or something? - Sarah. Mommy. Sarah. Mommy. - Kelly? Could you get me a tea, please? Sure. (shrill ringing) - Did you mail that card I gave you? - [Kelly] What card? - I gave you a postcard yesterday. - [Kelly] I don't remember you giving me anything to post. - Oh, my God! Shit! Where's my... Where the fuck is my pen? (wheezes) (Beth cries) - What is it you need? Sarah, what is it you need? I can't hear you. Is it this? (pen clatters) (Sarah speaks foreign language) - I'm so sorry. Thank you. (gasps, breathes deeply) - So gentlemen, to conclude this interim presentation, I believe, one, that there is a market need for a content broker, two, that there are significant first mover advantages, and three, that when we next meet, I will have worked out the optimum leverage at IPO, and we'll able to demonstrate how this integrates with your corporate strategy. Are there any questions? - Of course you make your presentation very well. It's almost a little too perfect, and that makes me nervous. I have to ask myself, "Do I trust this presentation?" - I'd like to reassure you that all of the data for this analysis has been fully researched. And I've never made a commitment I couldn't keep. - No, excuse me, I don't wanna seem rude. I'm talking about trust. I'm sure you always keep your word, but I'm talking about trust here. That's something very personal. - A feeling. - Yes. I'm talking about feeling. Do I trust this presentation? - I think we're dealing with a cultural thing here. We need to get to know you, and you need to get to know us better. - I can agree on that. - Why don't we make our final presentation on Thursday? I'd like to feel that you can trust our determination to make this a success. - Well, would Thursday give you enough time to finish this? - [Roger] Absolutely. - Lincoln? Is one day enough? - Sure. Day after tomorrow is fine. (sharp, fast clicking) (fax machine whirrs) (ominous music) - Are you okay with this? You're not getting any younger. - Piece of cake. - What do you think she'll have on? - Black knickers, definitely. (chuckles) (fax machine whirrs) - Bet you (mumbles) knickers. (fax machine whirrs) - I recon she wears some really baggy granny knickers. - You recon? - Yeah. - They're not hers. - You didn't. That's hers? (Sarah exclaims) (laughs) - You dog! (Sarah screams) (loud thump) (glass shatters) (slow, distorted music) - [Woman] What'd you do? - [Jeff] It wasn't my fault, he just-- - [Woman] You can't drive! - [Jeff] He wasn't looking where he was going, all right? There's nothing I could do, man. - Stay back, keep your mouth shut. Don't say nothing. We're gonna deal with it. - Oh, my. - Okay, Kelly, thanks. Take care of it until I get there. I'm on my way. (sighs) (exhales deeply) - I'll just be downstairs, okay? You're just a bit hot. - Are you all right? Where'd you get that bruise? Sarah? - [Sarah] Hm? - Nothing, sweetheart, you get some rest. - Yesterday. She had a fit at me. - Oh, God. I'm sorry, Kelly. - It's nothing. You go and get on with what you've got to do. I'll see to Beth and Sarah. (boat horn blares) (Beth babbles) (eerie hissing) - [Fiona] It's voodoo. (distorted, squeaky music) - I believe your wife is possessed. Once she found this tomb, she reawakened a sleeping spirit. - Please, you've gotta be kidding me. - I think you should ask my friend for help. - Just don't know if I can do that. To put her life in the hands of these crackpots? - Steve did. My husband. We always thought we were soulmates. Big lovers in a previous life. When he was diagnosed with cancer, voodoo helped us to deal with it. It reassured us that we would be reunited one day. I can't wait to be with him again. I miss him so much it hurts. When we're together again, this will turn blue, like the Gulf of Guinea. (dark, suspenseful music) (knocks) - Sarah? (door clicks open) - Can you come over for dinner tomorrow night? - Roger, there is no problem. Roger, I know what I'm going to do. (door swooshes faintly) (running footsteps) - How is she? - She's feeling much better. She's had a bath, and now she's taking a nap. (keyboard clicks) - Ready? And on there. - Kelly. Isn't it past her bedtime? - She'll sleep when she's ready to sleep. Do you want to see what she's been doing? - Not really. I wanna finish this up so I can get some sleep myself. - Just take a moment. When she's older, you won't remember how tiny her hands were. - I'll remember how much noise she made. - Should we show, should we show Daddy? Look. - Right, your hand print. - And now I got paint all over me. - It's because I just painted your hand. (Lincoln sighs) - Kelly. Please. Put her to bed. I need to work. - Okay, grumpy daddy. (sighs) - What are you doing? - Watching you work. - Kelly, go to bed. - Why don't you take a break? - I gotta get on with this. (Lincoln sighs) Kelly. (smooches) (Beth cries) It's Beth. (Beth wails) (wailing intensifies) (electronic buzzing) - Is everything all right? - [Lincoln] Gotta get to work. I'm late. God, I'm late. - Tell them you've been up with Beth all night. They'll understand that. - Trust me, they won't. - I'm really sorry I'm late. It won't happen again, Roger. - Take your time. - I was up all night with my baby daughter, Beth. (Lars chuckles) - Ah. He has a life. - How old is your daughter? - Almost two. - Oh, the terrible twos. Look. Well, have a cup of coffee and gather your thoughts. We have the time, Roger? - I have to leave at 10:00. - [Magnus] Well, we can carry on if we have to. - Family. The only compass in troubled waters. And our wives have to be very special, very special indeed, to cope with us in this line of work. (Beth squeals) - You got to call a doctor. She's completely lost it. She needs help. - Sarah, it's okay. I wanna help you. - No, it's not okay. Lincoln, I'm leaving. - Sarah, please. Where are you going? You don't have any clothes on. - I can't stay here. - Sarah, what about Beth? - You can have her. Get out of my way. - Sarah. - Get out of my way! (Lincoln yelps, then screams) (sniffs and coughs) (Lincoln sniffles) - I can smell her on you from yesterday. - We didn't do anything. Kelly? - [Kelly] What? - [Lincoln] Tell her. Nothing happened. - I mean that bitch Fiona. She's coming over, isn't she? - How did you know about that? - Good. - I'm going to call her and cancel. - No. I want her here. - (gasps) Sarah, we really have to work this out. I don't think you're well enough. - I want her here tonight and I'm leaving in the morning. - I'm calling to cancel. (Lincoln exclaims) - If you cancel, I'm leaving tonight. (Lincoln exclaims) (gasps) - I'm calling a doctor. I'm dialing. - [Woman] Lincoln, let me help you. - Kelly, get rid of her. - I should have done this ages ago. I'm calling a doctor, Sarah! Kelly! - [Woman] Kelly? Open the door. (breathes hard) - Oh, come on, answer! - [Woman] Kelly, open the door. (Beth cries) - Kelly, don't you answer that door! (Beth wails) Sarah, open this door! Who the fuck are you? Get out of my house! - I'm here to help. This was given to me by my great-grandfather. The French invaded Benin in West Africa around 1890. And these women were the warriors trained to defend Benin. The spirit that's in Sarah belongs to one of these women warriors. (crash) Her name is Asengan, and her mistake was to fall in love with a young French soldier. As punishment, the king killed her and cursed her spirit at death to always seek love but never find it. To always seek love but never find it. Asengan now rides Sarah's body as a horse. She's simply a vessel for the spirit. - Why do you give a damn? - Because I believe in love. Trust Fiona. And I'll initiate you later tonight. (water splashes) (metallic clank of silverware) (knocking) - I'm so sorry. - Thanks for coming over. Glass of wine? - Thanks. - Here go you. (wine gurgles) - I've poured some wine for you. - Are we gonna eat? I'll get it. Good. I could eat a fucking horse. (phone rings) (fax beeps and whirrs) - [Fiona] How did you hurt your nose? Sarah taken any hair from you? - No. - [Fiona] Nail clippings? - [Lincoln] No! - Blood from your nose perhaps? - What's going on? - I think she wants to take your body for her lover. (liquid gurgles) - Sarah! (Sarah screams) (Soft metallic thud) (electronic beeping) - Dammit, Kelly, I didn't wanna kill her! (Lincoln gasps and exclaims) (beeping stops) - I have to go do something with Fiona. Are you okay taking care of Beth? (Lincoln grunts) Kelly! - Just leave the psycho bitch. Me and you set up on our own - What? - I can make you much happier. I've been more of a mother to Beth. - I think we should act now, while Sarah is still out cold. - [Lincoln] We'll talk about this later. - You fucking bitch! You don't deserve him. (dull thuds) (grunts) - [Woman] Please drink it. You going to be okay waiting here? (sharp thud) - (speaks in foreign language) (exotic, fast-paced drums) (glass shatters and tinkles) (dull thudding) (Beth cries) (Beth sreams) - It's your baby, Sarah. Sarah? (sharp cracks) (gasps, hyperventilates) (Lincoln screams) (all chant) - Sarah! (Lincoln shouts) (screams shrilly) (heavy breathing) - I don't know that we finished the initiation. You might still be vulnerable. (Kelly sobs) (screams) Lincoln! I need you to listen to me. I want you to imagine that Sarah's in a coma. You must get her spirit to fight for her body and remind her of who she is. Boom will call the Council of Dead Kings to discuss Asengan's return to the spirit world. - What if the spirit doesn't wanna leave? - Let us deal with Asengan. And remember, Asengan wants your body. (Beth wails) (loud wooden crash) (Lincoln exclaims) (Lincoln gasps) (water rushes and gurgles) (low, ominous music) (speaks foreign language) - Sarah, you're not well. (speaks foreign language) (Lincoln exclaims and gasps) (Lincoln gasps) (speaks foreign language) (Lincoln grunts and exclaims) (thud) (Beth wails) (Sarah yells) (speaks foreign language) - You ready? (Sarah grunts) (phone keypad beeps) (screaming and ullulating) (Sarah groans) (exclaims in foreign language) (exclaims) (speaks in foreign langauge) - You have to remember who you are. This is not you. (exclaims in foreign language) (sirens blare) Sarah, do you remember who I am? It's Lincoln. We have a baby daughter named Beth. A beautiful baby daughter. Sarah, do you remember the things we've done? Do you remember having dinner at the 59 Club in L.A.? (exclaims in foreign language) I just started working, we thought we were rich. Sarah, do you remember how, when we went out on a jet ski in Mexico? Please, remember. Sarah. Sarah! (grunts) (coughs) Sarah, please! I can't remember a single fucking honest moment. I wasn't there when Beth was born, I wasn't there when your mother died, I wasn't there when you graduated, I missed your last birthday. I've never been there for you, Sarah. It's always you making the sacrifices for me, and I'm sorry. (sirens wail in distance) (sirens get louder) I don't know about any of this stuff. All I know is that I love you in my own twisted, selfish way, and I want you to come back to me. Sarah, please. I need you. (rain spatters) Sarah? Sarah! (sirens wail in distance) (sirens get louder) Sarah... - Hello? - [Sarah] Is Beth all right? (Lincoln gasps) - It's okay, Sarah, it's okay. It's okay, I have you now, Honey. (Beth screams and wails) (car motor idles) (eerie music) (electronic pop music) ♫ You'll hear the words ♫ Without sound ♫ My voice is muted in your mind ♫ You feel its form ♫ Begin to shape shift ♫ And time is still ♫ Minutes in the ♫ Century, ah ♫ You'll never feel ♫ The same again ♫ You'll never feel ♫ The same again ♫ Don't resist me ♫ Don't resist me now. ♫ (slurs words) ♫ Transformation ♫ Transformation of me. ♫ Mambo calling ♫ Mambo calling you ♫ In between ♫ Your world and mine ♫ There's a space ♫ A space in time ♫ In a dream ♫ When you are mine ♫ You're so shy ♫ In my little paradise ♫ Our souls align ♫ You reach for me ♫ And all I can be ♫ All I can be ♫ All I can be ♫ You seem so far away ♫ Love of mine ♫ You seem so far away ♫ You seem so far away ♫ Love of mine ♫ You seem so very far away ♫
