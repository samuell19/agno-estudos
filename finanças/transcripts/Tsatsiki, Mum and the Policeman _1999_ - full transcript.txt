His name is Gran. - He gave me a lift home. - I found him alone at the pool. He was standing at the bottom. Probably sneaked in. I broke the record, mum. - Are you crazy! - It'd be best if you kept him in check. Thanks, I don't need the police. You could have drowned! Well... Bye kiddo. - Thanks! - I made 42 seconds, anyway. Now we can go to Greece. ROOM FOR RENT So, you got any other surprises to offer? Our teacher's having a baby, so we're getting a new one tomorrow. Really! Wild. But, you're not eating anything.

Good night, Papa. But Tsatsiki is trying to sleep so it would be great if you could do what you doing more quietly. Yes. Yes, of course, I understand. I could... Sorry. - Good nigh. - Yes, good night. - Are you alright? - Miss! - Have you got the 50 crowns today? - You'll get it tomorrow. That's fine. And you, you well know you can't throw freebees in the yard. Put it down and get going. Until tomorrow, Greek. Then we'll play together. - Do you know anywhere to go dancing? - No? - Doesn't your mother go dancing? - I don't think so. Are they together? Her and that bass player? Nah, it's him that mostly is. She really needs a new guy. Someone who's more ordered. Yes, that'd be something. What a couple. Juice would be nice with the buns, but we don't have a jug. - Oh yes, I was going to buy a new one. - Or flowers. Or a present. Mum likes presents. - You can buy one from me. - What do you mean? Only 200 crowns and some police golds for dealing with someone bigger. - How much bigger? - Quite a lot. - Okay... as long as you don't cheat me. - I'll never cheat you. How often do you clean your windows? Once a day, once a week once a month or less? Okay. And then we get to... ...the toilets. Okay, come on! Like this... and this, and you're down. What the hell! Mum! He was just teaching me some police holds. Wanted him to. He shouldn't teach you to fight anyway. - You don't win through violence. - No... I agree with you. But for being against violence, you're pretty hard, I'm sorry, but I thought that... You understand. - I'm not making a success of this. - Gran bought a present for you. A present? What for? Maybe because he's moved in. For me? How sweet of you. What could this be? It's a... just a little something. It's the right size and everything. - Thanks. - Do you want a bun? Yes, please. - Does it hurt? - No, it's no problem. It only hurts when I chew. - Thank you. - Where'd you get that from? I sold a bikini to a cop. Stop that! - What the hell are you saying? - Stop that! If you say, 'Your dad's a shit' Your dad is a shit! Yes! Here. Can you manage to get to the principal? Smarten's already there. - Maybe you should see the nurse. - You want me to go home with you? - How are you, does it hurt? - I'm just a little dizzy. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Once a day, once a week, once a month or less often? How often do you clean your toilets? - Mum... - Once a day, once a week... Hey, what have you done there. Hmm... Have you hurt yourself? Did someone hit you? Hmm... That doesn't look too good. Check out our new poster instead. Imaginary Friends. Isn't that your style? A space theme. - Thanks for your time... - I thought we could use... Maybe you should go up. G' ran says that a steak is the best when you're hurt yourself. - Do you like dancing? - Yes. - Why do you ask. - It's nothing. Tell me about dad. - You've heard it 1000 times. - But still... I'd been checking him out every day for a week. I didn't dare go and say anything to him because he was so handsome. Then one day when I was on the promenade he was right in front of me. And he said 'hello' in Swedish because he'd lived and worked in Sweden. He asked if I wanted to go out on his boat. I said I wanted to. And so we swam in the middle of the night. And then we were together. And then you came along. Then I went home and we never kept in touch. He has your nose, by the way. Or had, maybe I should say. I want to go and see him. - We're fine the way we are. - But still... - We can't afford any trips. - If we get the money, though? - We'll see. - Promise me. I promise to go to the principal with you. - Oh no. - Oh yes! Mum, do we have to? You'll just get angry. I'll be as calm and nice and kind as anything. Trust me. Hello, I'm Tina Johnson. Perhaps you know my son, Tobias Johnson? - Yes... - The one with the mashed up nose. Oh, yes... The little incident yesterday. - I'm sorry, I'm a little busy. - So, you're busy? Yes, I'm pretty sure the red light was on outside the door. - So we can agree in a time... - Are you busy with this? - Yes, that's right. - Papers... Yes. One wishes that there were less of them. - Now there are less! Can we talk? - Mum! If we just calm down a little. What do you want? You to see that there are children here. Your damn duty is their safety! - I think the school... - Or do you want your nose pushed in? Or to be teased during breaks? Or to be attacked on the playground? - Mum, come on, let's leave. - Yes, we'll leave. Because I don't want my son to hear me swear. But if you don't make sure that no one here is threatened or hit very quickly then I'll come back. And then I'll be angry. Goodbye. - You promised to be calm. - I am calm. Where's this Marten? - Come on, say it! Go on! - What the hell are you doing? - What's it ti you? - You listen to me! - Why do you hit smaller kids? - You butt out you old bag! - What if I said your dad was a shit? - No one says anything about him! No one! You bloody old bag... You bloody... What are you staring at? Get out of here. Nine planets travel around our sun. First Mercury then Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn... - You have quite a mother. - I told her not to come. - She's cool, I think. - Do you? - And pretty. - Maybe she is. Saturn is surrounded by three rings made up of small particles. - Saturn is the second largest... - You want to come to my birthday party? - When is it? - In two and a half weeks. - Then I probably can. - That's as far as I got. Thank you very much, Sara. Tsatsiki? Would you like to show is your planet? Well, it's very nice. But the sea theme is the next project. I see. - Do you know... do you know? - No. - Sara is also going to Maria's party. - She's pretty. Maria is as well. - You going to date her? - I don't know, Are you? With Aaria. - Maybe later, in a while. - I'll probably also wait. - There'll be dancing at the party. - Who said so? - Sara, But I'm no good. - Me neither. Maybe you can practice. - What are you going to wear? - Something red maybe. - Then you stand out. - A suit is quite nice. But I haven't got one. And back again... D... Great! You'll be a rock star soon. Okay, let's go again. Guess which national colours these are? - Finland. - No, Greece. - Why must Marten come here? - Why not? He needs something to do and he's very talented. For being an idiot. He comes once a week to play. That's alright... It looks wonderful. Delicious... What do you do to show someone you like them? You can give them something... flowers or something. We drew hearts when I was small. I drew a heart for a guy. God, I was crazy in love with him. But it wasn't that he was handsome or anything. But there was something with his voice. over and in love.> family trait.> - It means, How are you in Greek. - Well, I'm fine. My motorcycle seems not okay Ah! This is your helmet - Kid's one... - Wonderful! - No one says Kids - We still does In our home town Thank you for a ride Who do you like better Mom or me? You came one hour early You're too motivated Be quiet and come in I will come in very quietly That's it... It was a dream Wash your face then you won't be sleepy - Did you open it? - See after washing your face Hi! You lazy, too? I'm here to wash my face I like studying So did I, but teacher doesn't listen to me any more Our monkey, my teacher is so nice I wish I had a mother like yours - I will be a singer! - I will be a diver Good job Watch well I can dive for 42 seconds, look! What Maria said to Hart? She's just staring him - What color is her eye? - Blue Same as Saharh, prettiest one How about dance? I will learn how to dance and then teach you I found it! Well done! One, two Try this, holding like this. - Wait... okay. - Which foot starts? This one? It's important you feel the music in your body. - Understand? So it's right... - Can I try? Can't we go out dancing sometime? Some night. - Just you and I. - I need a suit as well. - Yeah, sure. - You should see how it is at home. - It's totally different to the city. - Can we buy it on Friday? After school? Hey... we were going to practice the jive later. You have to try and imagine the music. It's like, you have to feel it in the body. - That's all I know. - What are we going to do now? I'm going with mum to buy a suit. Hi, Tina couldn't come today. Jump on and I'll drive you home. Tsatsiki... hmm? - You promised and then forgot it! - Not at all. - Stop playing. - Where's my suit, then? We can buy the suit another day. Okay? Any day. I can't now, the demo must be ready tonight or we don't do the record. It's really important, you know that. Can you stop playing, please! Hey, I'm sorry. Sorry, of course you should have the suit. We'll go right away. And the demo? We said we'd have it ready tonight, didn't we? I can take him. Shall we go? Come on, kiddo. Huh? Gran... Thanks... Okay... One, two, three, four... No. It's best we leave the bike. We'll take the underground instead. Come on. Are you angry with me? Are you angry because... You wanted me to like your mother. Well, now I do. I didn't mean for you to like her more than me. - No, no I don't - Yes, you do. It's in a different way... It's... ...a little hard to explain. But if we put it like this... If one adult likes another adult a lot... Then... then... Then maybe they want to... not want to... they maybe... ...like each other more than friends. - Are you coming? Suit, shirt and tie. Anything else you need? - Flippers. - Flippers? Yes, for Greece, but I'll pay for them myself. Let's not go home afterwards. Can't we do something else? - Yes! - Do you like Greed food? I don't know. When you've been to Greece you'll have to show me how to dance. - You're not angry anymore, huh? - No. When the right one turns up, the heart shouts shrill. - Then the head can say what it will. - Again. When the right one turns up, the heart shouts shrill. - Then th head can say what it will. - Nice one! Would you like to be together with her? No, I haven't got any fire insurance. You know who I like. It's a question of having the nerve to tell her. - Say it tonight. - Yes... yes, maybe. - Shall I say it for you? - No, thanks! Are you almost ready? Take the jacket. - What do you think mum will say? - She'll say that you are... ...the most handsome guy she's ever seen. After me, that is. - No, I'm just kidding. Shall we go in? - We have to sneak in. - Can you sneak in? - I am a policeman. No, no... - Yes... - But I don't want to. Aren't you going to bed? No, I'm just going to change the filter. There are lots of parts, huh? Yes, it's a question of putting it together in the right order. Everything in it's box. I like my stuff in order. Me too. Well, then it's just the reverse when you put it together again. At the moment, nothing is in order. I don't understand what's happening. I'm probably too ordered for this house. And I don't understand women here in the city, either. What's so special about that bass player? Huh? - Give me the number 12. - Are you going to hit him with it? No, no... I'm just going to tighten this. No, no... Always fixed spanners. There... With the shifting spanner there's a risk you wear down the nut. There we go. Not too tight. - Maybe it's the voice. - The voice? Yes. Didn't she say fell for voices? What else could it be? And finally the casing. It was lucky I didn't tell her, anyway. Huh? And turn the fuel back on.
