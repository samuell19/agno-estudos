Okay. Go now. Go now. Go, go. Go, go, go, go, go. Go now. This was a little paradise. This is the palace. Not exactly the palace, because it was not really a very comfortable place to live in, but I miss the clout, wherein, um... you can do so much. She's using the body for political purposes, because her big dream is to restore the greatness of the Marcos family, and it can only be done if you give him a hero's burial. And of course, outside of that, getting one of the children to run for the presidency. The main goal of Imelda Marcos is to vindicate the family's honor, the family's name, except that the Filipino nation will never allow for that. I, Ferdinand Edralin Marcos... My husband, President Marcos, became president at the height of the Cold War. Ferdinand Marcos was the most powerful man ever to rule the Philippines. His stature among world leaders brought him credibility at home. We love your adherence to democratic principle and to the democratic processes. The Marcos family appeared to be living the Filipino equivalent of Camelot. She made it known that she would one day be more than the average first lady. Marcos' wife, Imelda, is seen by many as the real power behind her husband's regime. Imelda embraced fame with a passion, the first lady in a political dynasty that ruled as if the Philippines were a personal treasure. But for all that, friends say Imelda is a deeply committed politician who believes she is closely associated with her people's destiny. My dream for my country is to regain paradise for all, and everything that was beautiful, that would make people happy, would be there. But I don't just dream. I want to give birth to it. I want to make it real. Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello. MaryAnn Bunyi, head executive assistant. - Hello, hello. - Good morning, ma'am. Oh, my gosh. Shirley. - Thank you. Thank you. Let's go here. I'm really so shocked because this was like a playhouse, and there was music and there was... beauty everywhere, where children could play. I'm so disappointed. Now... Sit down? And look straight at me, at my camera. - I look at you? - Look at me. Well, I had a beautiful and very happy childhood until I was eight years old, but when I lost my mother, it seemed like I lost everything. And being orphaned from my mother and left with nothing, I was always looking for someone to love me. This created my character. I grew up in a province. When there was this Miss Universe contest, I went to Manila, and they made me Miss Manila. And that's how Marcos became aware there was an Imelda in Manila. When I met Ferdinand Marcos, he was a congressman. In the first 20 minutes, he proposed marriage. I realized maybe this is the love, the mothering that I'm waiting for. So in 11 days, we got married. He was brilliant beyond all imagining, and she was drop-dead gorgeous. They have style with a capital S. Marcos bought this house in 1946. This is where he brought me when we got married. After all this shoe thing about Imelda, uh, having so many shoes, so people will give me things like this. So you see, the shoes became a joke. I was of help to him because our family happens to be strategically on the other side of the Philippines. My family comes from the south, and he comes from the north. And so it was a good combination, and I could campaign, and I would sing too. singing in native language In the beginning, I was having a hard time because here in this house, there were always plenty of people, and I was not used to that. Everything became so public. I had to cut ribbons. I had to do this. I had to do that. It came to a point that I-I could not take politics, really. And I was brought to the hospital in New York because I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. And the doctor said, "There's nothing wrong with her. She does not like politics, only." Then Marcos answered, "If that's the case, right now, I quit politics." When I heard that, and I knew he wanted to be president so that he could maximize his wealth and talent, then I said to myself, "Shame on you, Imelda. Here is the one man who's going to give up everything for you." I had to get a psychologist to say how lucky I am that I am honored to cut ribbons, how lucky I am that I'm invited here, how lucky I am that people come to my house, how lucky I am... Eventually I believed it, and before I knew it, I was really lucky and happy. I was completely different after that. Imelda very much enjoyed the role of first lady, and Marcos was afraid to leave the Philippines for fear there'd be a coup. So he used Imelda as the surrogate president, and she loved that. I did not want to read books about the leaders that I was going to meet, because I had my own eyes. I had my own ears and senses. Many leaders were called monsters. I did not find they were very mean. They were generous. They were kind. And if I did not know what was the problem, I would ask Chairman Mao, "What's your problem?" It's the same with Saddam Hussein, "What's your problem?" I can really say that there was no mission at the height of the Cold War that, uh, I failed. Here is Russia. Here. Here is Russia with. And here is Mrs. Mao. This is, uh, President Nixon playing the piano, and I'm singing there. He would come and call on me at my suite at Waldorf. He was very nice and very human, but he was misunderstood. There are many things women can do. Sometimes it helps that you're not taken too seriously. This is, um, the romantic Ferdinand Marcos. Every time, uh, I would go abroad, he would give me a picture and-- of him, and here he would write, "I shall bear my loneliness when you are away. To my eternal love." I must say that now that I look back at 35 years of marriage to Marcos, I had a beautiful married life, and I don't remember any... bad or ugly... sad, um, situation. Marcos had an eye for the ladies, which he didn't give up when he married, I might add. He had a world map, and he picked the farthest places from Manila he could send his wife and got her out of the way so he could carry on his affairs. And the one that he made a mistake about was this Dovie Beams, who-who was an American. Disgusting. Very disgusting. Oh, I'm sure Imelda was heartbroken about that. I'm sorry that he-he did that. That-that was... very sad for me. She had loved Marcos, and it did hurt her that he went to other women. I mean, she cried once on the general's shoulder, and she said, "I give him everything he wants, and still he cheats on me." singing gently Oh, yes, there was a tape recorder under the bed. That was it. So that's what she held over him. When she wanted something new, she would say, "I'll play the tapes again," you know, and, uh, he'd give-give in to whatever she said. After that, no one would ever stop her from anything. It was a shame, because her personality changed too. When Marcos became president, the Philippines was only 22 years after World War II. Manila was leveled to the ground like Warsaw. We had no rice. We had no water. We had no light. We had nothing. So we had to do it with a meager amount. The Marcoses were living like kings. No two ways about it. They spent money, all right. They did. Imelda, they used to say, had an edifice complex. She loved buildings, and I think that probably, in some ways, traces back to her background, which was relatively humble. She called me one day when she was staying at the Waldorf in New York: "What do you think of the Crown Building?" I said, "You know, it's beautiful. You know, 57th and Fifth and all that. And it's a lovely building." She said, "I'm gonna buy it," you know. And then she bought... four more. She was a spontaneous person for acquisitions. If she saw something she liked, she'd take it. Like buying out jewelry stores in Paris. And shipping animals from Africa. We were on safari in Kenya, and Imelda was fascinated with the wild animals. I got so envious that we didn't have those. So she ordered them. You know, like you buy a dress in Paris, you bring in animals from Africa. Then I said, "I will complete paradise for the Philippines, because we will also have the animals from Africa here." There was an American Texas rancher called Frank Yturria. He had met the late President Marcos long before he came president, in 1954. The president asked Frank, could they put some animals on an island? And they start talking about getting exotic animals in. Well, the new president of Kenya has put an embargo on shipping any more wild animals out of Kenya. We couldn't do it. And the telephone rang, and my wife said, "It's the president of the Philippines calling you." I said, "Hello, Mr. President," and he said, "Frank, I went and talked with President Kenyatta, and he agreed to let me have the animals." He said, "And by the way, I left a large briefcase on his desk." He said, "Need I say more?" I said, "No, sir, you don't have to say more." The deal was already completed, and we already had gotten a lot of animals in captivity. We'd taken a giraffe, Burchell's zebra, impala, and waterbuck. I have no idea what it cost, but she got her own little private zoo shipped from Africa. When Imelda's animals arrived, it was a problem of where these new guests would go if they were to roam free, which she insisted. So they finally settled on this small island where they wouldn't run into people. It was an island that was not inhabited by a group of people or did not have, um, communities there, except a few that I could, uh, tell them what to do. I was always criticized for being excessive, but that is mothering. That is the spirit of mothering. You cannot quantify love. And with my spirit and character of mothering, I want to mother not only the Philippines but the world. When I was younger, uh, my father and mother were always terribly busy. They were never home. They were always off campaigning or doing something terribly important. I really regretted the time that I was away from my parents. But this is the life the politicians have. As far as I'm concerned, the best politician that I've ever seen is my mother. Her politics are very intuitive and natural. I said, "I think I want you to be president one day like your dad," and they were very close, especially so he was the only boy. Bongbong studied abroad since he was nine years old. He was in London. He was at Oxford, Wharton. He was a little bit of a nerd as a kid, so he was--you know, he wanted to do physics, math, biology, but my grandfather was like, "There's no money in that, so switch to politics." I told him, "You are needed now." My mother wanted me to run since I was eight years old, so that's a given, you know? She-she's the one going around and telling everyone, "Oh, you must help my son like this and like that." "Mom, we haven't decided yet." "Yeah, yeah, but it's okay. Once you decide, that will be ready, so..." She's so political an animal, really. There's pressure for him to run for president. But, um... Thinking it over, we-we-we all decided that it would be best to go vice president and then if... God willing, the presidency. Welcome to Senator Bongbong Marcos in the house. Bongbong Marcos. Bongbong, president! Bongbong, president! Bongbong, president! Bongbong, president! Bongbong, president! Of course, we would also like to acknowledge Madame Imelda Romualdez Marcos. BBM! BBM! BBM! The vice presidency in the Philippines is something quite different from what it is maybe in the United States. We are voted in, uh, separately. Means that the vice president has their own mandate. Of course, a vice president's main function is to take over, should the president be unable to continue. Uh, that-that remains. But nobody voted any-anyone to just wait for-for the president or their boss to die. We-we have to find ways to make yourself useful. It-it was common knowledge that Senator Bongbong was eyeing the presidency, and people close to him were-were saying that, um, he opted to run for the vice presidency instead because he had better chances of-of winning the vice presidency instead of the presidency, but I think, um, this will only be a stepping-stone to what he really wants, and that is to be president just like his father. The commander in chief is authorized to adopt all the measures necessary to prevent the success of the enemy. Marcos blamed growing discontent on communist insurgents. He jailed dissidents and silenced all political opposition. The Marcos dictatorship had been in power for years, and the people themselves were starting to get tired of it. Plus the fact that the regime had become very corrupt. The young feel so disenchanted and frustrated. They feel that there is no future for them. Prices are going up. People are lining up in the streets to buy rice. People cannot find employment. The wealthy controls the destiny of our people. This must give way to meaningful reforms. People loved listening to Aquino, and he spoke flawlessly. And we all knew that, uh, if he would run for elections, he would easily win. Imelda, I think, had dated him when they were young and single, and she thought that Ninoy Aquino would always be loyal to her, but he was not, because he developed a real force against the Marcoses. The battle has been joined, and the time has come for all Filipinos to take sides. Either you are for the cause of freedom or the curse of tyranny. We were awakened in the middle of the night, and, um, my father had been arrested. Former Senator Benigno Aquino has been jailed on charges of subversion. Aquino's supporters say he was framed because he is the president's foremost political opponent. All of a sudden, I developed a chest pain, and I told my doctor, "I am very, very weak. Please bring me to the Philippine Heart Center and get me an examination." When Ninoy Aquino was sick and he was in the hospital in the Heart Center, my project, I can say that I was overly generous to him. Lo and behold, the beautiful one ascended into my suite. She came, and she was really beautiful. She has not aged. And she sat down and said... "I'm sorry to see you like that. Would you like to go to America?" Oh, oh. He felt that he owed it to the Filipino people. He wanted to have an audience with Marcos and tried to persuade him to call for clean and orderly elections. The very fact alone that we can land is victory enough. Everything after that's a bonus. I mean, whether they put me back in a plane and ship me out or bring me to prison, I promised to return. I have returned against all odds. So that's good enough for me. So it was Ver, General Ver, and Imelda Marcos who were, you know, in a way, calling the shots. Sure, sure. Thank you. I want to kiss him! You have to be very ready with your hand camera, because this action can become very fast. Yes. In a matter of three, four minutes, it could be all over, you know? And... I may not be able to talk to you again after this. That case remains unresolved. Well, it was never proven, you know, there was a hired assassin, but, uh, General Romulo, he was just heartbroken over that, because it was such a-a miserable, nasty thing to do. Of course, he suspected that it was Imelda. They were saying so, but why would I do that? He was no threat to me. In fact, I knew him before I knew Marcos. And some people, they say that he was courting me. And, uh--but, um... And it's not in my character to even quarrel with anyone, how much more kill anyone. And God knows... I was very kind to him. The killing of the late Senator Benigno Aquino sparked the movement that really brought out the people in their numbers. Under pressure from the United States, Marcos called a snap election. Recalling once more Ninoy's words, and I quote, "I will never be able to forgive myself if I will have to live with the knowledge that I could have done something and I did not do anything." I hereby affirm my candidacy... President Marcos and his wife, Imelda, continue their hard-hitting campaign, charging that the challenger shouldn't even be running for the presidency. I have no experience in cheating, stealing, lying, or assassinating political opponents. They couldn't be more opposite. It could be a cartoon. While Imelda, you know, was ostentatious and glamorous and into everything and so fashionable, and Cory, I doubt she even wore nail polish. You know, probably not. But very intelligent and very well educated. She really knew what she was about. She'd been through a lot. At the end of the day, the popular support Mrs. Aquino inspired was translated into votes. I am counting on a landslide to offset any cheating that Marcos will do. We came here, and we couldn't find our names, and there's about a thousand people who are the same, you know? There was always the possibility that Marcos would use fraud to beat Mrs. Aquino, despite assurances to the contrary. But by and large, it will be a fair, honest, and clean election. But it was obvious that they weren't. Television crews saw Marcos supporters transported to and from election rallies and Marcos votes being bought in exchange for food. The people realized that it was rigged, and even those who were tabulating the elections, young girls, stood up in protest and got out, and so the people saw that despite the elections, Marcos would still insist that he was the winner. I hereby proclaim Ferdinand E. Marcos as the duly elected president. Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Cory! Marcos loyalists opened fire, wounding dozens and killing one. It was so painful, because Marcos just won the election over Aquino. We won by more than one million votes. Ferdinand Marcos, after 20 years in power, laid defiant claim to another six-year term. There is no way under which I can step down or resign from the position of president. You know, when it finally was reduced to just the Marcos family alone in Malacañan Palace, and there were people at the gates just being held off by a security force, and that's when he finally agreed they ha-they had to leave, and Imelda wanted to leave too. A few days before, there was a big reception that I had to wear some jewelry. It's just been confirmed that Mr. Marcos has indeed left, and there's absolute chaos outside his palace. As it drew near midnight in Manila, the demonstrators stormed the gates of the palace to take back what they said was theirs. They looted Marcos' property. They rifled his files and defiled his portraits. They raided the Marcos' refrigerator. This has been stolen from the Filipino people! It was a burst of long-pent-up fury spent on a palace that was the very symbol of the Marcos dictatorship. Filipinos were staggered by the opulence and by Imelda's famous closet. The designer dresses, some from Rome, where only days before fleeing, she placed her last $80,000 order. She left behind 3,000 pairs of shoes. They found no skeletons but found only beautiful shoes. The long agony is over. We are finally free, and we can be truly proud of the unprecedented way we achieved our freedom. It's not true that we flee from our country. We were kidnapped. They told us we were going to Paoay, a town in Ilocos, only to be brought to Hawaii. And losing your country after being mother of your country for more than 20 years, then you became orphan, it was like losing my mother again. Of course, the United States government double-crossed Marcos, because there are elements in the United States that don't like dictators. Even though the dictators are our dictators, they don't like 'em. When I was being considered to be ambassador to the Philippines during Ronald Reagan's time, what killed me was that I told him that I was all in favor of Marcos remaining. "But he's a dictator." Yes, he's a dictator, but I said, "If you don't keep Marcos, I'm telling you that you're gonna lose all American military bases in the Philippines." What happened? We lost 'em when Aquino came in. Our hearts and hands are with President Aquino and her new government as they set out to meet the challenges ahead. Today the Filipino people celebrate the triumph of democracy, and the world celebrates with them. You have many friends, and suddenly when you are not in power, they don't even know you. So far, investigators say they've uncovered strong evidence of at least $250 million worth of Marcos real estate in the United States alone. Investigators are also checking to see if American money has been stolen in the hundreds of projects financed all over the country by U.S. aid. Frivaldo says corruption was widespread in the highway program of his province, highways built with U.S. aid money. Instead of having six to eight inches concrete on the highways, they would normally do it with two inches. Was Marcos getting any of this money? What else can you deduce? Tell me a country that doesn't have corruption, and don't say the U.S., because we're the worst. We give money to countries, and the money is not used for the purpose it was sent for, and we know it. First she had a beautiful home in, uh, Beverly Hills. She put it in George Hamilton's name. And when the Marcos regime fell, George sold it. Kept the money. So you see, everybody's corrupt. They even filed a case against me. The United States government against Imelda Marcos. This is only one case. Three hundred fifty thousand documents. I had a house full of documents. - Can you open the... - Yes, ma'am. Open the door. Here I placed the documents from New York. This is only one case against Mrs. Marcos in the trial of the century. Ferdinand Marcos, the former president, died Thursday in Hawaii. My husband was dead. I did not know where to live. Imelda Marcos is wearing black for her racketeering trial. You're facing the mightiest sword of justice of the world, and you're alone, widowed, and homeless and countryless and penniless. The jail would have been a welcome thing. It would be free board and lodging. Anyway, on my birthday, July 2, 1990, not guilty on all counts. Her lawyers told the jury even though Imelda Marcos was a world-class spender, that was not a crime, that however Ferdinand Marcos made the money was his business, not hers. I won it because of the truth. In spite of all that, Cory says... "She cannot come back home." There was an undercurrent of-of-of this, "How do we-how do we get home?" We-we all basically escaped, the kids, from the States. We weren't allowed to leave, but we left anyway. I remember very well buying the ticket, and I said, "I can't come home in coach." You know, I said-- called up a friend; I said, "Can you--I can't-- I don't have any money to buy a first-class ticket. Buy me a first-class-- I can't come home-- I've always been in first class. It's just too embarrassing." Her son, Bongbong, staged his own triumphant return last week. And while I was still at the airport, I immediately phoned my mother, who scolded me and said, "What are you doing there?" I'll never forget, but I said, "Mom, come home. It's fine. It's safe. We're gonna be all right." And a couple of weeks later, she was home. It was God's plan to... make me born in the Philippines. Nobody can stop me. Surrounded by her bodyguards and supporters, Imelda Marcos passed through nearly hysterical crowds toward the suburban Manila courthouse, ready to face corruption charges that could put her in prison for more than 100 years. The former first lady surrendered to authorities in order to be granted immediate bail. One of her lawyers brought the bail money in cash, rolled up in a Mister Donut napkin. A woman who had traveled in the world's most powerful circles for more than two decades was fingerprinted and released, awaiting her day in court on more than 70 civil and criminal charges. The Marcoses during their, um, tenure in power, plundered a lot of the nation's wealth, $5 billion to $10 billion in 1986. They felt that Philippine government funds belonged to them because they were the leaders of the country at that time. When I first arrived back home, being a Marcos was an issue. It was a political issue. It really...it hurt us a lot, especially media-wise, because the problem with the media is, the gun can kill you only up to the grave, but the media can kill you beyond the grave into infinity. While we are allowing the return of Imelda Marcos, the ban on the return of the remains of Ferdinand Marcos will continue. We announced that we were bringing him back, and... The Aquinos have been very unjust, inhuman to the Marcoses, not only to the living but also to the dead. No, no. No less than the son of Cory is president now. Between the mother and the son, you cannot tell who's worse. The commission was created in 1986 to track down and repatriate plundered wealth. So far, we've been able to remit back $4 billion, but I also hasten to add that many of these assets also have...you know, have really appreciated in terms of value. Oh, they sequestered everything. All the jewelry that they would find, all the valuables that they would encounter, all the beautiful things. The PCGG just would confiscate anything they wanted to get that they felt was stolen. Even this house, only a few months ago, was, um, being auctioned off. We cannot stay really here, because we do not know when we will be kicked out. Look, I am no longer first lady. I do not-- I'm not even allowed to go around the world anymore. They prohibit me. Everything--I can-- I cannot even have-- I have money in 170 banks and deposits of assets. I cannot even have them. And I, even at this stage, even at my age, I can go around the world and bring world peace. I befriended all of them. Gaddhafi was a friend. Um, Saddam Hussein. Mister, um... Mao Tse-tung. I just gave respect to him. He took my hand and kissed it. In five minutes, he said, "Mrs. Marcos, you started the end of the Cold War." In five minutes--Mao! So--and who is Imelda? I don't have an answer for why we allow Imelda to even open her mouth. I'd be--I'd be...okay for them to return. That's the Filipino in me. It's not okay for them to flaunt... flaunt what they stole. When I came back from abroad, in spite of all the bad publicity... Imelda! Imelda! That is something that surprises Americans, and all I can think of, the Filipinos are very forgiving people. Nobody said, "You can't do it." She came back. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Happy birthday, ma'am. - Thank you. You want a taste of my shoes? I was only eight years old when I became orphan. And when you lose your money-- your-your mother, you lose everything. You still have plans of running? Or are you going to anoint any of your children to do the Marcos work for you? Well, I go on and on about Bongbong, and he-he's my only son. So we will be seeing another Marcos in Malacañan? Being president is a... destiny. The San Juanico Bridge is that beautiful bridge. That is called the "Bridge of Love" as a gift of President Marcos to his beautiful wife, Imelda. My projects, I did not make them only good and right. It had to be beautiful. And beauty's really the extravagance of love. Once we left, I think then it started to fall to pieces, as often happens with a change in government, and all the people poured back onto the island, and nobody's tried to stop them. They couldn't. So you cannot say to a giraffe, "Don't wander in there. That's somebody's garden." The locals see them, they get upset 'cause that's their livelihood, so they shoot them or kill them. For anything to grow, even animals, they need love. That's why you need a mother in a government, because a mother makes everything whole. This project started with big money. The mystery is, to me, that Calauit has lasted so long, 37 years, and it's still surviving today. When I came back after our exile, I went back to Calauit to see how it was, and I was really so depressed and shocked to see what had happened. There was hardly anything left. I've been here for almost 40 years. They need qualified people there to stop inbreeding. The present group have come from a very small gene pool. There's been no effort made to separate father from mating with daughter. The son grows up and breeds with his mother. An animal doesn't know the difference. Inbreeding's already happened. It's there. The damage has been done. I've heard that some of the giraffe have got shortened necks. That's a physical one you see, but the ones that do the harm is the problems you cannot see. It's probably too late. Our vice president, president. We're really nostalgic today. Today we remember my dad, who is clearly with us with this breezy weather. Once again, we come to you to ask for your support, your affection, and your continued loyalty that my family has enjoyed through all these decades. All the municipalities are joining hands to support Bongbong for vice president 2016. I would like to greet, of course, our congresswoman from the second district, my mother, Congresswoman Imelda. We who have enjoyed a time when the Philippines was seen as a bright light in the community of nations, when we ourselves were proud to be Filipinos, we enjoyed that time. Unfortunately that time has passed. It's time to return to that moment in time. Yes, well, that's... that's-that's very important, getting the right message across. We have to see. We have to see. Time will only tell. Bongbong! Bongbong! Bongbong! Bongbong! Campaigns, in fact, are fun. Except for the candidate. Dealing with the public is a chore. The candidate's stressed out all the way. I'm often asked by members of the media, "Is it an advantage or a disadvantage to be born a Marcos in this day and age in politics?" First of all, my name is Ferdinand Marcos. I mean, how are you going to separate? And I'm his son. Um, there's no getting away from that. So, um, no, I have no reason or desire to separate myself. What it is, it is. It's difficult and it's also scary in the sense that if-if these people are brought to power again, there's a very big chance that the sins of the past will be committed again in the future. Never again! Never again! Never again martial law! As of the 21st of this month, I signed proclamation number 1081, placing the entire Philippines under martial law. The situation in the Philippines is obscured by rigid news censorship imposed when President Marcos put the country under martial law last Friday. Fourteen of Manila's 15 newspapers have been closed. Marcos has said he is trying to save his country from communism. Ferdinand Marcos mobilized the military and the police in order to perpetuate himself in power. Martial law, that was the best years of Marcos because that was when he was able to give the Philippines sovereignty, freedom, justice, human rights. Martial law was declared. A lot of journalists who were, uh, critical of the government had been arrested, but since I eluded the arresting unit, I went underground. I was going to a secret house. When the door was opened, uh, three strange men were there, and they pulled me in. They made me sit and-and, uh, tied my hands, um, blindfolded me, and started, uh, hours of questioning. I was a teacher. One thing led to another. I got involved. To meet as five people was enough to arrest you and detain you and accuse you of subversion. We were taken to... an open-air barracks for the enlisted men. Uh, they'd hit me in the chest. They, uh, made me, uh, squat, and while I was squatting, they'd hit my shins with a bamboo handle. The electric shocks, they-they were really painful, 'cause they'd, you know, increase the voltage every time you lied to them. They made me do what they called, uh, the San Juanico Bridge. They made me lie down between two beds with my head on one bed and my feet on the other and my body hanging in the air. I would fall from the pull of gravity. Isn't it cynical? The Bridge of Love for one set of people becomes a method of torture for another set of people, the so-called enemies of the state. I was really scared that they were going to rape me. They made me lie down. So they started to take the panties out. I don't know who, because it--I was blindfolded. I only knew that all my-- both my arms and my legs were being held down. And someone started running his hands all over my body. Then some finger went in. And they said... "You probably have, uh, small letters hidden inside." By then, I wasn't fighting. I was numb. I was ready for it. I was burned with, um, wax candle. I was molested, sexually molested by agents of the state. So the fingers were getting in and out and in, and then there was a radio call. The radio call said, "Bring the girl in." No hands were holding me anymore, but I couldn't get up. It wasn't from the beating. It was from the... uh... disillusionment that people, people as in persons, can actually do these things to another. And some of those who tortured me were actually students of mine who were planted in the schools to spy on us. My brother, when I was in prison, decided that he would join the resistance. At some point, the military command-- the commander of the unit that, uh, caught them decided, "Ah, let's not bring them to the camp anymore. Get rid--kill them." He was 27 at the time. They were not officially executed. That-that's just it. That-that's why it's called extrajudicial executions, extrajudicial killings. And, uh, there's the rain. My body was traumatized. I had no control over the tremors. The agents, they came to me, and they said, "Ma'am, can we continue with the history classes?" So what did I do? I taught them. I helped them. Helped me recover. 'Cause to them... In Filipino, they'd say... speaking Filipino "Nothing personal. This is just work." I felt proud about myself. I stood up to them. I did not give away any other. It sort of like, um... washed away, washed away the-the pain, because I bought their safety. Senator Bongbong Marcos, your opening statement, please, sir. First of all, thank you for this chance to speak to the issues of the day. It's all right. Senator Marcos, please continue with your statement. Go ahead. Go ahead, please, sir. I cannot give what I do not have. I do not have what you are-- I do not have control. I do not have any knowledge of any of the things. Once again, let me repeat, I cannot give what I do not have. Senator Marcos is spending a lot of money in this campaign. He's been paying off mayors, congressmen, governors. He's been giving out money left and right. And you ask yourself, where is that-- where-where is all that money coming from? This one is, of course, a Picasso. Marcos would say, "Imelda, I know how to earn money properly, but you know how to spend money properly because you buy beauty." We filed a motion with the Philippine graft court, called the Sandiganbayan, and asked for a writ of attachment on these paintings because they are the subject of litigation. There was a team that went to her house in Makati, and they took photographs of the walls. You could see that the paintings had been replaced. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here's another interesting photo. Here you can see the bust of President Marcos. And there are two important paintings on the left and right side, but subsequently when the raiding team came in, there's the bust, the medals are still there, but instead of paintings, you have the photos of Mrs. Marcos and President Marcos. So they were removed. There's the Michelangelo. The photo of President Marcos instead. And I was also told that the master's bedroom was locked and that the team members were not allowed to go in. There was a, um... a Monet painting that was recently sold in New York for $32 million by the social secretary of Mrs. Marcos, and that alerted the authorities, and they immediately conducted an investigation in respect of these funds. So together with a colleague, we went over to her house and asked her, you know, "Mrs. Marcos, we wanted to know whether you are claiming ownership of the painting." And, uh, she replied to me, "In case I do say that I own the painting, will it be given back to me?" There have been so many cases. God knows how many cases there have been. Imelda Marcos has gotten away with murder. I mean, she-she always gets acquitted. The stealing of the money by the billions impacted all the economic development of the Filipino people and made the people impoverished. There's a huge gap between the rich and the poor. If you're rich and you're in power, it becomes very easy for you to get the people to your side, ensuring that they're taken care of by funds and money that they spread around. singing in native language To the mother of all, our only first lady, Madame Imelda, with leaders who are one with their people, this nation will be strong again. Philippines will be a great nation again. When I became first lady, it became more demanding for me. If I'm going to the slum areas, I have to dress up and make myself more beautiful because... This continuing poverty nurtured the intolerance of the people and their belief that only a strong man could give them security. If I become the president, I will eradicate corruption, criminality and drugs. Mayor Rodrigo Duterte took the number one spot in the latest presidential race survey. Meanwhile Senator Bongbong Marcos Jr. got the lead in the vice presidential survey, with 26 percent. The elitist type of democratic rule that followed after Marcos did not really go down to the poor people. What matters now is for them to be informed. Our education system has not been able to put the lessons of history in the history books. speaking indistinctly in native language Since the return of the Marcoses, there's been a trickle of new information in YouTube, in Google that's a revision of the interpretation of martial law. We are sure it's the Marcoses. BBM! BBM! BBM! BBM! singing in native language Good morning, good morning. Good morning, good morning, good morning. The old job seemed like a walk in the park compared to this one. Before, the main task was to try to recover ill-gotten wealth. Now it is to preserve our democracy. He was newly appointed to be the chief for the elections in preparation to knock us out again, I suppose. Yes, I'm feeling-- I'm feeling that, uh, by all indications, we should be successful today. And they know where-- what side of the bread is buttered and for whom to vote for. Yeah. Oh, okay. It is now approximately one to two hours before the close of our polling places, and we are preparing for the transmission of results of the elections. Vice president! The extremely close vice presidential race is keeping many people on the edge of their seats. Ah. Leni Robredo takes the lead on the partial and unofficial count for vice president. Bongbong Marcos is firm he will not concede the vice presidential race to Leni Robredo. Okay, we're now going to an ANC live event, as Senator Bongbong Marcos is holding a media briefing after filing an electoral protest before the Supreme Court. Let's listen in. Against, uh, Leni Robredo, the supposed and proclaimed vice president, uh, from the last elections, because we have many-- we have been able to gather many evidence-- much evidence, uh, concerning several aspects of the election. Right after, um, I realized that I was winning, I already knew 100 percent that he will not accept defeat, because this is the nearest that he already got to being back in power. He did not want to disappoint his mother or his family. Um, this is a shortcut, um, to get back to power instead of trying again in the next elections. , what's the latest? Hi, Vivian. You're right, the canvassing of votes for president and vice presidential candidates is finally over after three days. Leni Robredo is the vice presidential front-runner with 14.4 million votes, followed by Bongbong Marcos with 14.1 million votes. Such an interesting case, Rody Duterte. I have to say, did you see this coming? - No. - Okay. I didn't, uh, see this coming. It's like Trump. No one saw Trump coming. Duterte! Duterte! Duterte! Somebody has to answer for all of these things that's happening to the country. Either you kill me, or I will kill you idiots. I think people voted him to power because he looked like them; he spoke like them. Of course, it turns out that he isn't at all from the poor. His parents are rich and so on, but he managed to package him-himself so that he looked like one from the people. I do not do it because of, uh-- We all know my father was a cabinet member of President Marcos during the first term of his presidency. If there's--the close-- We have--we have been supportive of him, um, from-from the very beginning. If there was any help and any assistance given to then-candidate Duterte, it was in the form of-of political endorsement. It was a form of political support. Obviously there is that connection wherein money that had been looted and hidden is now being brought back into the Philippines in order to finance political campaigns. The PCGG was created solely to pursue the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. And what they want to do now is to give that power to the solicitor general, who actively campaigned for Senator Marcos in the 2016 elections. Cases will probably be dismissed, and the assets that are under supervision of the PCGG will probably be returned to the Marcoses. It is quite ironic that... having gone after the Marcos' ill-gotten wealth, which is in the billions of dollars, I am now being accused of having ill-gotten wealth in the millions of pesos, and these allegations are-are baseless, and yet they were being made, I know, because they wanted to destroy my credibility as well as the credibility of the 2016 elections. Little did we know that the Marcoses financed, in a big way, the election of Duterte. So it was a very convenient alliance, which is now paving the way for Bongbong Marcos to get to Malacañan, the sooner, the better. Almost everyone who has the balls to criticize him in public get ostracized, get persecuted, and I'm fully aware. I'm fully aware that my being very vocal of this administration's policies will cost me something. But, you know, if I don't do it, who will? The fact that President Aquino appointed me got me into the hit list of people that they wanted to be removed. For the well-being of my family, including myself, I thought that it would be beneficial for everybody concerned that I first leave the Philippines. I went to my brother in Oklahoma. I am scared to return to the Philippines. Ever since the new administration has come in, the Marcoses have been able to regain a lot of political clout. They have scrubbed clean the sins of the past, and they're trying to project themselves as the leaders for the future. "Payback Time for Campaign Contributions." This is the title of our statement. We express our gravest concern that the Marcoses bought and paid for the privilege of having the dictator's remains buried on sacred ground. We simply never thought to see this kind of flagrant abuse after the people's judgment of the Marcoses in 1986. This president, during his campaign, he said the funeral parlors should prepare for more business, and now we have 30,000 people killed. Deaths under investigation. It is happening again, and it reminds us of what it felt during the time of the Marcos dictatorship. We don't know what to do, actually. You cannot run to the police. It's the police that's doing it. Since Duterte cannot govern... democratically, he has to create an enemy to justify the use of force. It was my father's fervent wish that when he came to the end of his days that he be buried in a simple soldier's ceremony. We thank President Rodrigo Duterte for his recognition of my father's service to the nation. Let us be the heroes that my father asked us all to be and finally bring the Filipinos to greatness. One day, we will just wake up and find ourselves having a new vice president, and that is Bongbong Marcos, because the conditions, um, are there. The Supreme Court, which is trying the protest case, is friendly to Duterte and to the Marcoses because it's the same Supreme Court that allowed the burial of the late dictator at the Heroes' Cemetery. Duterte has been very vocal that he would resign as president if he had Bongbong Marcos for vice president. Things will move the way President Duterte will want it. You need a strong leader. You need a strong leader. The preparation for the return of the Marcos family to political power started many years before many were aware of it, and people were just taking it too easy, not believing that it was possible. You know, it is really inbreeding, because when dynasties are embedded in the political landscape already, it's as if political positions can just be inherited. There have been a lot of recorded ill effects of allowing political dynasties to flourish. I could not only be number one first lady. I had to be a mother. I had to embrace everybody, take care of everybody, love everybody. Ensure that there was a solution to all their problems. And I was there totally. I was no longer mother of my family, of the first family, mother of the people here in the Philippines. After a while, I was mothering all over the world. It is more than a fairy tale, because it's really unbelievable. I gave birth to what I dreamt of, and I always got my way.
