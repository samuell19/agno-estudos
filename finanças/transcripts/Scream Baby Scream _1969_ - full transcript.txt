[music playing] [music playing] [screaming] Oh my god! Tell me exactly how it happened. Where did it come from? I don't know where it came from. All right. I didn't see anyone. Have your driver's license-- I need a little bit of-- I don't know where-- I don't know where he came from! Oh my god. Where did he come from? --[inaudible] what happened here-- come over here-- [sirens blaring] I don't know what to do! [music playing] I've got to go back. I've gotta-- she's still back there. I've got to go back-- Just relax, son. Just relax. I've got to go back. I've got to go back. She's still there. I've got to go back. This won't hurt. That's the boy. What's your name? Jason, Jason Grant. You live at home with your folks? Uh-uh, no. Let me ask you this, is there anyone to care for you while you're recuperating? Janet? Janet? Janet who? Janet Wells. [music playing] You don't understand, I've got to go back. She's still there. I've got-- Just calm down. Calm down. What do you do, Jason? Me? I'm a student. What are you studying? I'm an art student. JASON: [THINKING] Two weeks. Was it only two weeks ago that all this began? [music playing] Well, well, well, Ms. Wells. You have a great deal of talent. Yes, very good. If you'd spend less time being cute, you'd have more time for your drawing. That's really good, Janet. Thanks, Marika. But it could be better. I'm afraid we'll have to call it quits for the day. I'll see you all tomorrow. Well, see you in the morning. You don't have to wait that long. Sorry, Joyce. I've got other plans. Won't you even take a rain check? Maybe next week, OK? Ciao. Hey Janet, I'm really starving. Let's go eat. Food? Did someone say food? That's a wonderful idea. Who invited you? Uh, here he goes again. Mr. Instant Uptight. Scotty is coming, because I invited him. OK. Come on, let's go. Hm. Hey Marika? Yes, Jason. Would you care to join us? Why, I'd love to. But maybe you three would like to be alone for a change, hm? Ha, ha, ha. Come on. [music playing] Who's there? [gasping] [screaming] And where do you think you're going? With you. Where did you think I was going? Not tonight, Jason. What do you mean? Look, I'm tired, I dirty. And I want to go to sleep. Good. It just so happens I'm tired and dirty. And I could use a good night's sleep. Then you better go home. Because I feel like painting for a few hours. First you say you want to sleep. And then you say you want to paint all night. What are you trying to tell me? Look, I just feel like being alone for one night. Sometimes I wonder why you bother to pay rent on that apartment of yours. So do I. I'd just as soon give it up. We could be living proof that two can live as cheap as one. Dead proof. If my parents come into town for a little visit? We can take care of them. How? By making it all legal. Please don't start that again. Why, you love me don't you? Of course I do. Well? I just don't know I'm ready to play housewife yet. And you never will be, if you keep analyzing everything. I just feel something's missing, that's all. I don't intend going on like this forever. Try and hold out a little while longer. Yeah. Well, you just go out in the house there, and paint your masterpiece. Jason, you'll never change. See you tomorrow. [screaming] [music playing] Morning. What happened to the other model? She didn't show up. I'm sorry about last night. I just felt like working. That's OK, I'm getting used to it. I'll fix you dinner tonight. Is that really necessary? What's that? Such attention to detail. OK, you can take your break now. When Mr. Butler gets here, try and look talented? Charles Butler, master of the macabre. Well, I certainly hope he doesn't look like one of his paintings. Don't be so sarcastic. You might learn something. Are you kidding? That man's work really turns me off. He happens to be a very important artist. Listen to this. It has been said that Charles Butler paints the dark side of the soul. Although his work reflects a very dim view of the human condition, he has nevertheless captured on canvas the violent strain that exists in the soft underbelly of our society. -Violenced? Let me see that. Aren't they fascinating? Fascinating? Why anyone buys this junk is beyond me. They buy it because they dig it. They buy it because it's in fashion. It's the technique that intrigues me. I'll have to agree with Jason. I think they're superficial. You two just can't see, that's all. What's there to see? To me, it looks like a bad dream. Is all the we see or see but a dream within a dream? I was eavesdropping. Please forgive me. Mr. Butler, so good of you to come. Thank you for allowing me. Students, this is Charles Butler, although I know he needs no introduction. How do you do? Hi. Mr. Butler said that he'd like to meet you all. It's always a pleasure for me to meet those who represent the future. Would you like to see some of their work? Very much. Perhaps I can even find something for my own collection? Mr. Butler? Yes? I'd like to ask you a question. Go right ahead. Do you feel your work has influenced other artists? I'm afraid I lead a rather cloistered life. I haven't had much opportunity to view the work of my contemporaries. Excuse me, sir. How did you arrive at your present style? Imagination, inspiration, and the resources acquired during a lifetime experimenting with techniques. That's very interesting. Mr. Butler, where do you find your models? It's not easy, given my specialized requirements. Are you trying to mirror an aspect of contemporary life? A lofty ambition, but I'll be satisfied if my work mirrors my own particular fascination with the, shall we say the darker side of life? I leave interpretation to the critics. Mr. Butler, why are your paintings so grotesque? Grotesque? No man can dictate to another where he must find his beauty. Each man must find his own truth, and create according to that truth as best he can. I have found mine, and it is reflected in my work. But don't you think the artist has a responsibility to elevate, nourish the human spirit? The only responsibility is to be true to your own vision. Nothing else matters. This is quite good. You have a great deal of talent, Miss-- Wells. But please call me Janet. Why, thank you, Janet. Hm, you have a great deal of talent, Ms., uh-- [HIGH-PITCHED] Please call me Janet. I could do without that man, his attitude and his work. What did he ever do to you? Uh, he gives me the creeps. That's because you can't separate the artist from his work. I've got a feeling you'd like to try. Maybe. Watch it, baby. Maybe he could paint me in a corner, but he doesn't compete with me-- not for you. Well, well, what do we have here? Please don't let us disturb you. That's all right. I want to get our dinner started. Hey, dig it, why don't we all get together tomorrow and take a little trip? Hey, yeah, how about a picnic? How about a what? You know, Marika, sometimes I think you and I just don't communicate. Marika, he means acid. Let's Jason, you said we would sometime. And we will, sometime. Don't worry, I'll talk him into it tonight. I'll twist his arm a little. How about you, Marika? Yeah, I don't know-- She'll be there, I see to that. Hey, listen, you want a ride home? Yeah, I'll bring [inaudible]. All right. I'll give you a buzz in the morning, let you know what time and where, OK? Don't be late for dinner, I want to do some work late. I didn't mean to break anything up. God, can she be inconsiderate at times? Well, she says things about thinking. We all do. You know what your trouble is? You're too considerate. I'm just telling you what I see. Yeah, that's what I mean. You know, I don't understand you. If you love someone-- I mean really, really love someone-- then you take them as they are. You sound like an expert. Make I am. [music playing] Want some more wine? No thanks. Didn't you like it? What's that? My spaghetti sauce. Mm, it was good, very good. You eat so fast, how could you taste it? Can't you find a subject more suitable for your talents? Like what? Like me, for instance. You won't be still long enough. That's not what you said last week. I'm so sleepy. Amen. Ah-- you've really got it made, buddy. [cat meowing] Guess what? This summer, as soon as school is out, we are going to Spain. We're going to rent a little house on the beach, paint, fish and live off the fat of the land. I can't go. Huh? I can't go. What do you mean? I've signed up for the anatomy course this summer. I'll give you all the anatomy lessons you need. All right, what's the matter? Nothing. Come on, what is it? I don't know, I guess I just stopped to think too long. What are you thinking about? About my work mostly. Oh, your work. Well, don't say it like that. Well, how am I supposed to say it? I don't know, but not like that. How about, um-- [PLUCKS GUITAR STRING] oh, your work? Oh, your work? Oh, your work. You asked me what's wrong, didn't you? I want to paint too. Only I don't let it eat up my whole life the way you do. You're different, that's all. I take my work furiously. I know. I'll never be the greatest painter that ever came along, but I'll make a damn good Illustrator. And that's better than being some tormented Van Gogh. Why do you paint? Why don't you be a plumber? Well, maybe I would be a plumber, if I thought it would make me happy. What's happy anyway? I don't know. But you keep running at this rate, and you're going to burn yourself out. That's my problem. People can't keep up with that kind of running. Then I'll leave them behind. Isn't that kind of callous? Just honest. Would you be lonely? Who isn't? Even now? Even now. [music playing] [screaming] The window, there's something at the window. Oh! What is it? I stubbed my toe. There's nothing out there. You realize it's 4 o'clock in the morning, and you sit there looking out the window? But I saw something that's horrible. Ah, you've been looking at too many of Butler's drawings. But I saw something, I know I did. Don't be afraid, my dear. I want to drink your blood. Oh, don't be cute, Jason. I'm frightened. Well, if you'd stop acting like we're in Transylvania, I can stop talking like Count Dracula, and we can both get some sleep. You know-- I think I must be going out of my head. You kids are really great. One peppercorn, is that all you want? Yeah, that's all we want, Max. I suppose you want four spoons? No thanks, we'll uh, share this one. Communal lip. Just to think, some day you kids are gonna take over the world. Drink hard. Max, baby, you're all heart. Well, kiddies, I guess the time has finally arrived. Now for the benefit of those who have never seen acid before, here it is. It looks just like a sugar cube. It is a sugar cube. You see, acid is a transparent liquid. So we just soak it into the cube. What does it taste like? Well, it doesn't really have any taste. That's why we drop it in the coffee and take it. How do you know it's good acid? What's the matter, you getting cold feet? Come on, Jason, you promised. Maybe Jason's right. Well, listen, I'm not twisting anybody's arm. I mean, if you're afraid to take acid, then just bow out gracefully now, before we blow the whole afternoon sitting around arguing over who's in and who's out. Please, Jason, you gave me your word. Yeah, I know I did. Hey. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll flip a coin. Heads are in, tails, you're our. Forget it. We're here, aren't we. Let's get on with it. Marika, how about you? I guess so. Good. Now that we've all made a unanimous decision on this, what do you say we see what's shaking in the outer limits? I wish I felt as calm as the rest of you. Now it may get a little hairy once in a while, but don't let it flip you out. Just hang on to a nice thought, and man, it's going to be beautiful. [engines blaring] [music playing] What are you doing? I'm looking at my hand. I'm really seeing it. That's a beautiful hand. Do you know what I wish? What do you wish? I wish this would never end. Too bad we have to be stoned to feel like that. Do you have to say that? I'm sorry. [fake accent] Well, Ms. Wells, you seem greatly disturbed. Perhaps we have touched on something significant here? Hey, you know, I think you're crazy. Crazy in love with you, my dear. Head over heels in love with you, my dear. [music playing] You are really crazy? Isn't this beautiful, Jason? Jason? [screaming] There's something back there, it's horrible! All right, hold it. Just calm down. Now tell me what happened. There was a man, but with a hideous face. All right, I'll-- I'll take a look, all right? Now you just relax, and I'll be right back. Be careful. [clears throat] You startled me. I'm sorry-- Beautiful, don't you think? [music playing] I don't know what's happening to me. I feel like such a fool. That's all right. You're not the first one who had a bad trip, especially the first time around. But what about last night? He was so real. What about last night? Never mind. She had a bad dream, that's all. Somehow I feel like it's still near. Yeah, I know. But don't forget, you were pretty stoned. And you can really see some wild things. But I don't want to see things like that. There are lots of things in this world that people don't like. But they're there just the same, and you've got to learn to deal with them. Not me. If it doesn't fit, I throw it out. You can't live your whole life that way. I won't live it any other way. Look, if it doesn't work, then rub it out. OK? You're all better. Hey, isn't there a party or something tonight? What do you mean party? Don't tell me I wasted all that good acid. What are you talking about? My group's playing at the club tonight. I'm expecting to see you all there. If you pick me up later, we can meet them both at the club. I want to paint now. Could you drop me off at school? Sure, OK. [music playing] Who's there? Mr. Butler? I've frightened you, I'm sorry. Well, It's just that I was expecting someone else. I had a feeling you'd might be here. But I didn't even know I'd be coming here until a little while ago. You seem to be working. Am I interrupting? I wish you were-- I guess I lost my inspiration on the way over. Ah-- I've come at an opportune time then. I had a feeling you understood my work. Your face intrigued me so, that-- that I did this for you. I feel so strange. Like a nightmare that I don't want to think about. I can't help being attracted by it. It's yours. But you can't. Oh please, it was done for you. Yet I will always possess it in my own way. I know what you mean. It's just the same for me. What you paint has to become part of you, or it can't be any good. Of course. Which is why calling this a nightmare seems so strange to me. I'm sorry. You need be. You see, yesterday's nightmare is today's dream and tomorrow's reality. Well, today's reality is that I can't work, and that's a nightmare to me. Do you ever have that problem? If you know what you're attempting to accomplish, then there is no problem. What if you're not certain? Then find out. But without the answer to that, you're lost. I know. My life is so full of confusion, I can't see through it sometimes. Then find a way out of the confusion. Have you found a way out, to do this? If you go beyond imagination and create an entirely new world, then the one you have left becomes far less real than the one you have found-- even if you have to build that new world yourself. I wouldn't even know where to begin. Never worry about the beginning. It's the work itself that gives us meaning. Does your work mean so much to you? Yes. I would do anything for my work. Oh, excuse me. I'll wait for you outside. No, no. Please stay. I was just leaving. Haven't we met? That's right. We met the other day. Jason's in class with me. Unfortunate for him. Well, I must be going. Goodnight, Mr. Butler. And thank you for the painting. I hope I'll see you again soon. I hope so. Well, well, well, haven't we become cozy all of a sudden? Don't start that again, Jason. Well, what in the hell was he doing here anyway? He just came by to give me this. Good Lord, he must be joking. [laughter] [grunting] [applause] [music playing] [SINGING] You can't rely on the next emotion when she walks away. You think you're gonna cry. You can't rely in the way that you feel when you know that she's gone. You think you're gonna die. [SINGING] In time. [SINGING] You feel better when you forget her. Oh, you'd be so happy. She'll be happy too with someone new. She'll be happy too with someone new. Some people will never [inaudible] and when the day comes, you'll know that someone is right for you. Couldn't be wrong for you. Feel it, don't fight it. You can rely. And I know that's goodbye, because when she decided she might say goodbye. You can't rely that the feeling inside is not your stupid pride. And she might pass you bye. You feel better when you forget her. Ah, you'll be so happy. She'll be happy too with someone new. She'll be happy too with someone new. [applause] [music playing] Where's Janet? Oh, she's over there dancing with some guy. She looks nice tonight. You want to dance with me? Hey, why don't you sit down and cool it, will you? Has anyone seen my purse? It's over here, Janet. Thanks to the girl scouts, we're going to get to stoned. That's my girl, always prepared. Not now, thanks. That's nice. I wish I had Butler's painting to look at now. Haven't you had enough depravity for one day? It's not my fault you can't see beauty. I see yours, and I don't like his version of it. Too bad. Because it's part of my life now. Well, I don't like that part. Some people will settle for it. Good, let them. OK. And it won't be the first time either. You rat. Somebody calling me? No. Oh, I get it. You two are fighting again-- That's none of your business. You know, you're just wasting your time. You're going to make up later on anyway. I don't have to do anything. Can't you listen to anyone? You mean him? Hey, do me a favor-- uh, don't bring me into your arguments. You listen to him enough for the both of us. Why not, if he's got something to say? Hey, please don't fight over me. Oh, bug off. Don't talk to him like that. Yeah, don't talk to him like that. I don't care if I never talk to him at all. But I don't think we care to stay here any longer. I don't think we do. Will you take me home, Scotty? Sure, come on. You're not going anywhere. I'll do anything I want to. Not with him, you won't. Listen, man, she does whatever she digs to do. She wants to go with me, then that's groovy. Let me go. Hey, I'm sorry. Forget it, man. You're really uptight. Jason, this time you went too far. [music playing] Jason, sit down. I'll be right there. Does it hurt much? No, it's OK. Come on, lean back. Jason, this might hurt. Good, things have been going too well lately. Getting sorry for ourselves, are we? Don't want to play with the other children anymore, hm? You're really very sweet, you know that? And you're very upset. That's got nothing to do with it. [music playing] I'm sorry. Why, Jason? This might sound phony to you, but you deserve better. But Jason, I don't understand. No, listen. We could spend the night together, and it would be beautiful. But tomorrow I just want to go back to Janet. You see what I mean? Well, I hope you know what you're doing. So do I. Well, I guess I better be going. Are you sure you don't mind being alone? Not tonight. Jason? Jason, call me in the morning. I will. Thanks. For what? Just thanks. I guess he really brought you down, huh? He sure brought me down the hard way. Hey, I'm sorry. I guess I just don't know when to shut up. It's not your fault. I just never thought he had it in him. You know, you never cease to amaze me. I mean, every time I stick my big foot in my mouth, you always come to my rescue. And I really don't know what I've done to deserve it. You can say you're lucky. It's kind of strange isn't it, how we all use something for a crutch? I mean, I'm always the innocent clown. And you're always hiding behind your canvases. Why don't you stop playing games, and take up painting seriously? Eh, maybe I will someday. [music playing] Do you think you could take me home now? I will if you promise we can get together again sometime. I mean, even if it's just to sit and talk. I'll think about it. Janet, before we go, there is one thing I would like to say though. There's a crab crawling across your foot. Oh, now you've done it. I'll never find him in this dark. Caesar? Where are you? [meowing] Janet? Janet? Caesar? Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty? Where are you? Janet? --[inaudible] Caesar, where are you? [screaming] [phone ringing] Still no answer? Nope. Well, she probably went home to visit her parents for the weekend. But then why didn't she say something? I don't know. Oh, she'll be back in a couple of days. Yeah, maybe. [music playing] Man, I'm so tired, I could sleep for a year. What the hell was that? My mouth feels like the bottom of a bird cage. Hey babe, why don't you take me home to roost? Cool it. I've had enough vultures for one day. Well, you struck out again. Hey, it looks like someone didn't make it home last night. Hey, maybe they stopped for a few winks. Let's get a little closer to the situation. Now come on. Maybe they want to be alone. You see any do not disturb sign? Come on. Let's scare the daylights out of them. All right, now [inaudible]. I'll count to three, and then we'll give it to them, all right? Come on. One, two-- [screaming] Jason, please, we've been looking all afternoon. This isn't doing any good. This is doing just fine. When Janet can come back, she will. Janet's not coming back. But she doesn't like her parents enough to stay there for long. Not only doesn't she like them enough to stay with them, she doesn't like them enough to go there at all. Oh, of course she did. Don't tell me, I know. I called them long distance, station to station. And I spoke to the maid, the maid. No Janet no parents, one lousy maid. Parents are in Europe, haven't heard from Janet. Where ever she is, baby, she's not home. Well, I'm sure there's a reason for it. Of course, it simple. She's out expressing herself. She's shacked up with somebody. Jason, don't. I'm just going to find her, that's all. Do you have to drink like that? Marika, don't worry about me. I'm just going to find her. His neck's broken. When did you see him last? Um, last night at the party? Did he leave alone? No, he was with um, Janet. Janet? Janet who? Janet Wells. What time did they leave? Oh, I don't know. It must have been early, because there was the fight-- A fight-- a fight with whom? Now come on, son. You know we're going to find out sooner or later. Now who did he have the fight with? Jason, Jason Grant. Her dresses are here, her shoes are here, everything. Jason, will you please sit down? I can't, I've got to keep looking. Jason, stop it! Jason, here's the book of Butler's drawings. That's neat. She said she wanted to see him again. That was just to make you jealous. Maybe not. What are you looking for? I don't know. Jason, where are you going? Don't ask me any questions, OK? [music playing] I think you deserve an explanation. You're here because you've expressed an interest in my work. And because I sensed an affinity within you. I did not always paint this way. Not so long ago, there was a marked change in my approach. Things where very different. My work was good; not well known, but it was good. When my style changed, no one took much notice. And they couldn't know when it really began. It started with my hands. I began to lose something. They wouldn't move the way they should. Not only the muscles, but the skin seemed to go bad. There was something wrong with my face, nothing startling, but something was definitely changing. There was a doctor I had heard about. I thought he might be able to help. His name was Garrison. He was such a funny little man. He didn't look much like a genius. He was witty, friendly, and then I showed him my hands. He had no idea what could be done. He told me that he wanted a few days with we me for preparation. I'll have to make more tests, sir. But it's obvious you have a progressive deterioration of the muscle tissue. I can't paint, I can't work. What can I do? Mr. Butler, please. Well, there must be something you could do. Perhaps I spoke a little too abruptly. There is a procedure I've experimented with. It might prove useful in your treatment. Then you must try it. It's not that simple. I said experiment. There's no guarantee, and it could prove dangerous. I don't care you must help me. All right. This is my address. It's not easy to find. You will come and stay with me for a few weeks. But remember, this must be done in complete privacy. [music playing] He was right. His home was difficult to find. Laura, this is Mr. Charles Butler. He's going to stay with this for a while. How do you do? [music playing] I hope I won't be too much of a bother to you. Oh, I'm sure you won't. Actually we're so isolated here, I'll welcome the distraction. Laura, why don't you show Mr. Butler to his room? Mr. Butler? Please, call me Charles. Won't you come this way, Charles? It might have been the uncertainty of my condition, but I recognized in Laura a quality I thought I would never again find in anyone. Do you think he can cure me? He can do almost anything. Is that why you married him? Perhaps. What if he finds out? He won't. He hardly knows I'm in the house. But what would he do? You mean to us? Would he still try to cure me? Of course. His whole life is in his work. I know. I used to feel the same way. Now I'm beginning to realize how much I overlooked. MR. BUTLER: It wasn't really wrong. Didn't care what Garrison would think. There was no time to worry about that. I'm going to give you a series of three injections; each one, highly dependent on the other. You see, the drug alters the form of the living tissue to the degree needed, but compensates for the change without being fatal to the tissue Now I'm going to give you an anesthetic. When you wake up, there'll be some pain and some packages. Don't be alarmed. [music playing] Doctor, I want to see my face. There's a mirror over there on the wall. [music intensifies] My face! [screaming] I marked [inaudible]. I mark you. MR. BUTLER: Days went by. Days filled with loneliness and despair. Laura was gone, her screams still ringing in my ears. At first, I want to kill Garrison. But seeing how pitiful he became when Laura left robbed the me the desire for revenge. So we both stayed on in this house, tied together as if by some evil design. Something snapped inside of me. He spend every moment at work in the laboratory, obsessed with trying to find a way to restore my face. As though by so doing, he could bring Laura back. One day I found canvases and pains in my room. Garrison was not content to try to rehabilitate my face. He had to have me back at work, as well. To my surprise, I found myself starting to paint again. When Garrison felt he had perfected his techniques, he was eager to begin working on me. The drug, when injected into the skin would break down the cell structure of the scar tissue, so that it could be molded like a piece of clay. He hoped over a period of weeks to gradually reconstruct my face along its former lines. For some unknown reason, I felt compelled to deliver myself into the hands of this man, who was responsible for my plight. Meanwhile I was painting with an intensity I have never known before. Out of the depths of my tournament, I had uncovered a part of my soul that had been laying dormant. I was ceased with a desire to reveal it in my work. Suddenly, my canvases were ablaze with all the color and passion, which before they had lacked. Weeks of treatments followed, but Garrison's labors were beginning to bear results. I knew then that I would stay on in this house and continue with my work, or Garrison had placed in my hands the means with which I would shape a new world. You, Janet, are a part of that world. Why me? Why? I know that you're suffering, but you'll see, you'll have love and a place in our world. [music playing] [knocking on door] Open up, get out here! Yes? I'm looking for Janet Wells, who lives here? Janet Wells? Who lives here? Who are you? Me? Me? I'm Dr. Garrison. May I help you? I want Janet. Where is she? Janet? Oh yes, of course. You're that young man from the school. You can go now. Please forgive him. We have very few visitors. The hell with that. Where's Janet? I can see that you're upset. Why don't you come in and sit down? Knock it off. Where's Janet? What makes you think I know where she is? She said she wanted to see you. I'd only be too happy to see her. But the fact is I haven't seen her since the evening I saw you last. You haven't? Of course not. Did you do have an argument? I guess I was upset. But she's always talking about you and your work. I'm flattered. But I hardly think you have reason to be jealous. How did you manage to find this place? One of your drawings. One of my drawings? Yes, uh-- there's a gazebo in one of them. I recognized it, so I came here. Very clever. Are you sure you wouldn't like to come in and have a drink? No, thank you. I have to keep-- [music playing] I've got to keep looking for Janet. There is one favor you can do for me. You see, I like to pick my company, so if you would just keep my secret? Of course. And when you're feeling better, do come back. I will. [music intensifies] What are you doing? But this is my laboratory. I realize that. But there is some preparations which I have to make. You've taken my home, you've stolen my work. I won't let you bring anyone else here. I can't let this go on. Don't worry. I'll see that you're well-provided for. [music playing] I see you're rather persistent. All right. Where's Janet. She is here. That was her cat. You're rather observant as well. I know she's here. Do you? What's going on here? Curiosity can be a weakness, young man. Look, Mr. Butler, I'm not here to match wits with you. I want to know what's going on here. Why don't you just sit down and relax? You sit down and relax. I'm going to find her. [music playing] Janet? Jason! Janet? Janet? Get out of here, get out. I knew I'd find you, Janet. You shouldn't have. Come out, I'm getting you out of here. Do you know there's a dead man in that other room? I can't go. I don't understand. What are you talking a-- [music playing] Oh, my god. --[inaudible], I'm sculpted like clay. Get out of here, Jason! Get out before they find you. Oh, lord. Get out! Get out, Jason! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! He hasn't yet regained consciousness. Hand me the syringe, please. Eventually we're going to leave here. We'll find a place where our world can flourish. Open his shirt, please. [music playing] The change has begun. I'll give him the second injection in four hours. Don't be afraid, Jason. I'm gonna kill that son of a-- Shh. I'll kill that man, I swear to god. You can't, what good would it do? Untie me, Janet. We'll get out of here together. You'll leave with me? Look at me. Do you still want me? Janet, help me. You've got to help get me out of here. Have you had the first injection? What are you talking about? Janet, untie me. All right, Jason. Come on, let's get out of here quick. I can't go. I'll get help. Be careful, Jason. There may be some others downstairs. I'll be back. [music playing] Damn you, get out of my way! Seal it, you can't leave now! [screaming] [grunting] [screaming] I know this place, it's just outside of town. WOMAN OVER PA: Dr. Corbin, report staff room, please. Do he have anything else in his possession, doc? Oh, just some change, a bunch of keys, nothing important. I want to see those later. How is he, doc? I think he's going to be all right. He's got a slight concussion. We're going to keep him two days for observation. Uh-huh, did he say anything? Not since last night to my knowledge. He was in shock when they brought him in. He did keep murmuring something though, about a house and a girl. Girl? Did he mention her name? It seems to be it would be Janet. Oh, that would be Janet Wells. Look, Lieutenant, I know it's none of my business, but what is he wanted for? He's wanted in connection with a homicide and a missing person. The homicide is a friend of his, or was. And the missing person is his girlfriend, Janet Wells. Lieutenant Sheridan? Yes? I'm Marika Gold. How is he? I haven't seen him yet. Uh, Ms. Gold, this is Dr. Cappel. How are you doing? Have you seen this drawing before? Yes, that's one of Charles Butler's drawings. And Jason took it with him when he left. Can we go in to see him now, Doctor? I suppose you'll have to. But please don't stay too long. Give us a chance to do our job, and then you can do yours. OK. [music playing] He's not in his room. That's not possible. Was anyone watching him? No, I didn't think that was necessary. I'll broadcast an alert. In the meantime, you check with your personnel to see if anyone saw him leave. He can't get fair with that concussion. Maybe he didn't have too far to get. [music playing] Janet? Janet? Janet, are you in there? Janet, where are you? Janet? [cat shrieking] Jason? Jason! [screaming] You see, yesterday's nightmare is today's dream and tomorrow's reality. [music playing]
