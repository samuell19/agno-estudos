We have no choice but to believe him He has exhausted his bag of tricks Let's wait for one to two hours Uncle Yin, you have to come to rescue me before dawn I wonder if he is telling the truth They must be discussing about how to kill me before dawn It's a pity that I'll die here The tomb of the greatest hero Jiang Xiao Yu What do you want? This is called pre-emptive attack Guess it's too much dividing buried treasure in 7 parts What's going on? Don't blame me, you've said earlier either you live or I die Bai Hai Sin, you are going to die We've been together for so many years You are too ruthless to be a human being We are not human beings anyway Don't move See where you can hide? Why's that? Have we not agreed already? But Bai Hai Sin and I have agreed even earlier It's unexpected that you two... We are not human beings either Hey, fatty, do you want us to kill you or will you kill yourself, come out I beg you... Please... don't kill me Don't kill me, I'll give up the treasure Please... Please... let me go Please... You... One is prone to fail at the time when one is complacent with one's success You might have forgotten that the Smiling Dagger has 3 poisonous spears Siao Mi Mi, kill him for me If I want to kill him, I wouldn't be here It's me who has asked him to kill you Ha Ha Er, your poisonous spears work Sure, this is my last move of course, it must work Siao Mi Mi, after you've got the treasure is it true that you'll never leave me? Of course, I love you forever I knew that your secret weapon is lethal I haven't been shot by your poisonous spear You... you two... We two are the real partners Can't imagine after being together for so many years you are now killing each other Mind your own business See, the moon is going down west and the sun will soon be rising If you still can't find the treasure you too have to die No. He won't die here Yin Nan Tien That's right, it's me Uncle Yin Xiao Yu Erh, are you alright? My kung fu is so good, of course I'm alright He's called Xiao Yu Erh That's right, he's the son of your sworn brother Xiao Yu Erh Why have you brought them here? Someone in the martial arts world has made up some fake maps saying that you've hidden treasure here There's no such thing at all The treasures I had, belonged to your father & had been taken by your dad's housekeeper Jiang Chin Who made all these fake maps? Jiang Bei He the hypocrite What? Jiang again Hero Jiang Miss Mu Yung, how are you? Fine Any news from Master Hua? Not yet Do you feel lonely waiting here all by yourself for Master Hua You...

Bastard, you've made us lose face Master Hua, I apologize Senior I apologize Senior, you... I I have already shot the Jin Sze needle into your pressure point Once you move the needle will follow the flow of your blood Within 7 steps, it will get into your liver's veins and you will start laughing In no more than an hour you will die of laughing Jiang Bei He, you are so ruthless Miss Mu Yung, it's been rumored that Yin Nan Tien has returned to the martial arts world, I have a grudge against him so I must take you away as hostage Because you are the daughter of Yin Nan Tien's mistress Having you with me will make him more scrupulous Let's go Still want to fight? Have you forgotten that you cannot survive 7 steps? Master Hua, my pressure point has been numbed and I cannot move, you can't save me You'd better wait until we've all gone and think of a way to save yourself Hua Mu Juet, do you really want to die by laughing? Master Hua, please Please don't move the last step Don't worry, everyone has one life Even the Hua Mu Juet is no exception Master Hua... Dad, we don't have much time we'd better kill Hua Mu Juet Take Mu Yung Ching away If we kill Hua Mu Juet I'm just afraid that the Yi Hua Palace Princess will... Don't worry, we can... blame it on Yin Nan Tien Good idea, let's go Hua Mu Juet, the only good thing I do in my whole life is to allow you an easy death Master Hua Xiao Yu Erh That's right, it's me Hua Mu Juet, go on laughing Master Hua How do you feel? You shouldn't have beaten me all the time Dad, you handle him first I'll take care of Hua Mu Juet Don't be afraid, you've stopped laughing Yin Nan Tien That's right, it's me It's quite unexpected that after 1 8 years we meet again Uncle Yin, do you know him? Yes, he's Jiang Chin, the one who took away your family treasure and betrayed your dad No wonder you've made so many fake maps so that martial artists will fight against each other, while you can divert other people's attention simultaneously hoping no one'd know where the treasure has been hidden Give me back my father's treasure Jiang Chin, don't try to escape Dad, take me with you... He doesn't deserve to be a father How's he? He's been wounded by the Jin Sze needle Only by your internal power can it be forced out Xiao Yu Erh, release her pressure point It's none of my business Uncle Yin asked me to do it, don't blame me for this Thank you How's he doing? Thanks for saving my life Don't mention it... Alright, you've your life back Xiao Yu Erh, who is he anyway? He's Hua Mu Juet of the Yi Hua Palace What? He's from the Yi Hua Palace? Uncle Yin, don't kill him Why? Your father was killed by them But he's saved my life twice Unfortunately, he has to kill me though he's saved me Why do you have to kill him? I also wish to know We from the Yi Hua Palace have to obey orders of the Yi Hua Palace Princess It's her again; I'm just going to find her Alright, I'll let you go but tell her that at tomorrow noon Xiao Yu Erh and I will wait for her at the Man Hua Wood You'd better ask her why she wants to kill Xiao Yu Erh What? You want to know why Yes, I've also heard that people from Yi Hua Palace has killed his father, is this true? Hua Mu Juet, you've grown up in this place you should know the rules of the Yi Hua Palace There's no such thing as should or should not the only thing matters is whether I like it or not But I can't kill the one who saved my life He's the one who saved your life? I killed his father. If you don't kill him ...he will kill me! Hua Mu Juet, do you really want to know why I asked you to kill Jiang Xiao Yu? Alright, I'll tell you after he dies A Miss Tieh would like to see you Miss Tieh, what's your business here at this late hour? I am here to kill you There are two cups here One of them has poison If you choose the one with poison you'll be the one to die otherwise... it will be me Why should I choose? Are you afraid? Don't you have confidence? Do you fight only if you feel confident? If you fight only if you know that you will win then this is not a duel this is murder Why are you willing to fight for Xiao Yu Erh? You love him? Xiao Yu Erh is more fortunate than I am There's still one person in this world who is willing to die for him Regardless of whether this wine is poisoned it's your own choice This is a fair duel Yes, I believe so Wait You can't drink this wine Why? It's poisoned This is meant to be a duel to the death Even if it's poisoned, no one can blame me I blame you for putting poison in both drinks You can deceive others with this trick but not me No matter which one he chooses, he is going to die If I did this it was in order to save you I don't appreciate it you use such dirty tricks to save me Get lost Xiao Yu Erh, why aren't you convinced that I am willing to die for you? Why didn't you check to see whether there's poison in both drinks before you threw her out? Do you really believe that there're so many good people in this world? Yes I do It's weird; she is willing to die for me but I called her a liar She wanted to poison you but you are still putting in good words for her There's no explanation for everything and I don't know why we've to have a duel Like you, I don't know either You're leaving? We have to meet for the last time tomorrow People tell the truth at the last hour before their death or do things they've always wanted Tieh Sin Nan is willing to die with Xiao Yu Erh because she loves him Xiao Yu Erh doesn't want you to die because he loves you You still don't know why you have to kill him Still that same old story I hope I don't have to fight with Xiao Yu Erh tomorrow But you... why? Because of you I'm afraid that you might get hurt in the duel tomorrow The duel starts at noon, why are you here so early? I couldn't sleep, what about you? I haven't slept either It's strange that ever since I left Villains' Valley I've been very happy But in the last couple of days, I've changed There are so many things that I don't understand Why do I like you? Why do I have to fight you? I know Because he is Hua Mu Juet and you are Xiao Yu Erh, you two live for today's duel So you are the princess of the Yi Hua Palace who wants him to kill me Hua Mu Juet, kill him Princess You've been brought up by me. C'mon, draw your sword Jiang Xiao Yu, I was brought up by her I must listen to her Now you know why you have to kill me Princess said she'll tell me after you die Xiao Yu Erh You... Xiao Yu Erh Xiao Yu Erh Xiao Yu Erh... Why didn't you wait for me? Yin Nan Tien You've killed him Uncle Yin, forgive me I am from the Yi Hua Palace I must listen to the princess of the Yi Hua Palace What? You again Princess, you can tell me now why I have to kill Xiao Yu Erh Of course Retreat Yes Why did you ask them to retreat? For the reputation of the Yi Hua Palace I can only tell you about this it cannot be passed on to the martial arts world What is it? Eighteen years ago I fell in love with the number one scholar Jiang Fung but he eloped with my maid Hua Yuet Lao and hid in the Man Hua Cliff, and bore 2 children Later they were betrayed by Jiang Chin To take revenge for this, I killed both and separated the two brothers I brought up one, and gave one to Yin Nan Tien so that when they grow up, they'll fight against each other Only by this can I have my revenge and get rid of my hatred for your family What? Xiao Yu Erh is my little brother You are such a ruthless woman Hua Mu Juet, it's your turn because after I've told the truth even if you don't kill me, I will kill you It's you Hua Mu Juet He's Jiang Chin, the housekeeper, who betrayed your Dad Your father was killed by him Now you understand why I have to tell you the secret of 1 8 years ago because I know that Jiang Chin and I will definitely kill you today Last night, I took Uncle Wan's potion so I could stop my pulse Only by doing this will you tell the truth and lure Jiang Chin here Xiao Yu Erh. Watch out her Yi Hua kung fu Don't touch her body She is old and ugly I believe no man wants to touch her Jiang Chin, you'd pay for what you did You ruthless villain, where can you hide? You old bitch, you are so ruthless how can you crown yourself with such pretty name as the princess of the Yi Hua Palace You should call yourself an evil old hag You must be tired of living No matter what I will have you stab my chest Hua Mu Juet Xiao Yu Erh Uncle Wan, what is it? I've examined these 2 cups One is with poison and one is without Last night Tieh really risked her life to save me Xiao Yu Erh She is now at the lakeside You'd better clean up yourself get changed before you go to her Okay What are you doing here? Nothing much, I just want to tell you that I'm so sorry that I took off all your clothes that day and made a mistake What? Besides, you are not some second-hand commodity You are so bad...
