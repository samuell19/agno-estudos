Here it is. John Doe. John Doe is a legitimate name, Captain Peters. What do you got? His wallet was under the bed. His name was Grubowsky. \\ Invasion of the Bee Girls // Just one more question, Mrs. Grubowsky. I know how difficult this must be. Did your husband have any previous history of heart trouble? No. Anything else? Among other things, coronary thrombosis. Meaning? A clot in the right and left ventricle. Formed by coagulation of the blood. Due from extreme exhaustion. Was he fooling around? Was he ever. Like I said, I was in the room next door, but I didn't hear anything. Not a sound. Are you sure, Mr. Ferris? Well, think carefully. Well, except maybe for one thing. - Well, go ahead. - They left the TV set on. Do you remember what was playing? No, it was after it went off the air, I mean. I could hear it humming. - Humming? - You know... Yeah, yeah. You remember what time that was? Oh, about 10:00 p.m., I guess. I don't know. Anything else? No, that's... that's everything. Well, thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr. Ferris. - We know how to get in touch with you. - They have all that written down. Thank you. Bob. I don't know if it means anything, but check the local TV stations. Right. What's the matter? They just found another body. Hi. What can I do for you? Oh, I'm Neil Agar. State Department of Security. Oh, yeah. All right, it's been a madhouse around here. Somewhere in this mess of bureaucratic garbage is your telegram. Sorry I couldn't meet you at the airport myself. Oh, that's okay. Uh, could I take a look at the Grubowsky file, please? Oh, yeah, yeah. When do the stitches come out? They're out. I've been briefed. They asked me to help keep you out of trouble. What happened? Uh, nothing much, really. I guess they sent me down on this one. It looks like an easy one after that last one. That's what I figured. I don't know what the government wants in this one for, it seems innocuous enough. Well, the Pentagon likes to keep their eye on government-sponsored research facilities, like Brandt. You know. Incidentally, we had another one. Another what? Another death. Heart attack, massive coronary. I've scheduled an autopsy. This somebody at Brandt, Captain? No. Kid at the factory. You think the government wants in that one, too? It was there all the time. A kid with heart failure? Thanks. Just one moment. - Hi. - Hi. Neil Agar. I'm expected. Okay. Great, it's through those double doors. Thank you. Can I help you? I do. I'm sorry, he's not in his office. Michael Levy, please call reception. Hey, I'm really sorry. Gee, this place is really impressive. Who's in charge? I am. - Really? - Yes. Well, I'm Neil Agar, State Department Security. I'm here to investigate Professor Grubowsky's death. What can I do for you? Well, you assisted him, didn't you, on his bacteriological warfare report? That's right. Could I see the file, please? That's, uh, highly confidential information. Well, you wouldn't want me to pull rank on you, would you? May I see your clearance? Now may I see the file, please? Will Mr. Paul Heller, please call reception. How dare you go through my things! That's just part of the job. But you were the last person to see him alive, and you had dinner with him on the night he was murdered. Why do you say "murdered"? Sorry. Well, we had dinner that night. Uh, whenever we work late, we always have dinner. Uh, Gretchen knew about it. - Gretchen? - His wife. How convenient. All right. You might as well know. We went to dinner at the Flamingo Bar and Grill. And by about 10 o'clock, we were playing kneesies under the table, and having dessert. Like the good old days. And then we went to the motel. And then it happened. What happened? We balled, and we balled, and we balled. Till he dropped dead. Touch√©. Let's go to lunch. It's a small town, Mr. Agar. Nothing ever really happens here. So we have to find ways to amuse ourselves. We never really get a chance to get down to LA. There are a lot of sex games that go on here. Wife swapping, and, uh, a lot of related nonsense. Scientists really aren't any different from the rest of humanity. Just a bit more inventive, is all. Excuse me. Am I boring you, Mr. Agar? Oh, I'm sorry. You were saying? All of Jack's friends are notorious Don Juans. And do you know that from your own personal experience? Still doing your job, Mr. Agar? Do me a favor, will ya? Just call me Neil? That's Dr. Murger. He's head of Reproductive Biology. His pet project is the study of the two-way transmission of sensory sexual information. He's quite a loner, though. I have yet to see him in the company of a woman. Kind of ironic for a sex researcher. Is he straight? I haven't the vaguest. Why don't you... go get undressed? Okay. Oh, Eddie, can't you wait? Jesus Christ! I can't believe he's gone. I didn't know Grubowsky had a bad heart. No one did. I'd sure like to meet the girl he was with, hmm? At least, there couldn't have been too much pain involved. I mean, how would you classify that? Accidental manslaughter? - You know what I've always hoped? - What? That when my time comes... Yeah? ...there'd be a few seconds of ecstasy... ...and then, oblivion. No, just think about it, boys. Coming and going at the same time. - Hello? - Gretchen Grubowsky? Yes, this is she. It's very important we have a talk. Who is this? I knew your late husband very well. Who? I was the last person to see him alive, if you know what I mean. I was with him in the motel. I don't know what you're talking about. My husband never... Don't lie to yourself. It's very important we meet. It's a matter of his good name. You understand? Yes, I understand. Okay, I'll pick you up at the corner of Pine and Hill in half an hour. Well, I for one... I'm going to miss him. That dumb, horny bastard. You gentlemen mind if I join you? Please, sit down. Thank you. I'm Neil Agar, State Department Security. Christ, they didn't fly you all the way here for this, did they? Well, Professor Grubowsky was involved in government research, wasn't he? I know, but God Almighty, every time somebody gets a nosebleed, you guys run a security check! Well, doing what you fellows do, we kind of have to keep our eye out for you. But you didn't watch Grubowsky close enough, did ya? Uh, you're... Herb Kline. Herb Kline. Yeah, that's, um... That's Strategic Alternatives. Right! And? Stan Williams. Genetics. Stan Williams. This is Aldo Ferrara, head of Department of Diagnostics and Clinical Biometrics. Glad to meet you. Thank you. Uh, listen. Please forgive us. You know, naturally, we're quite upset. - Jack... - Thanks. He was a very special man. I see, uh. Oh, I take it, then, he was a good friend of all of yours? Yeah. Very good friends. It should happen to me. Who's the lady? Ballantine's. On the rocks. Dr. Susan Harris. Uh, she runs the comprehensive entomological lab, along with Dr. Norstad, who heads the department. It's all right. That's all right. Let him get an eyeful of her, 'cause that's all he's going to get. It's common knowledge. Iceberg. Iceberg. Remember, boys, there's always the six-sevenths below the surface, hmm? If anyone can help you with Grubowsky's preliminary state of health bio, Doctor Lyons can. Good. It's strange, he said he'd be here in a few minutes. Let's wait a few minutes. I'm sure he'll be right back. Aloha. Well, hello! I didn't see you there. Thanks. No, really, it's kind of dark out here. Hey, you having some trouble? Nothing you couldn't fix, Officer. It may sound ridiculous, but could it be some form of epidemic? That's a very tough question to answer, Jim. Now, each death is perfectly normal, in itself. But what about a 21-year-old boy that dies of thrombosis? Isn't that just a little unusual? True. But there's nothing else we can attribute it to. At least, that showed up in our autopsy. You keep talking about sexual exhaustion. Harv here didn't even have a history of heart trouble. Neither did Dr. Lyons. Or Grubowsky. I don't know what to tell you, Jim. It's as much a mystery to me as it is to you. Great. Yeah, well, I'm gonna call in the Public Health Service. You really think that's necessary? I don't think we have any choice. We've got two men dead at Brandt in the last two days. A little too much of a coincidence. Keep me posted, will you, Peters? Keep him posted. I'd love to. If I knew what the hell was doing it. The meeting will come to order, please. Captain Peters? Thank you, Your Honor. Now as you all probably know, we've had eight deaths in the last three days. I've tried to compile a list here, and fix the actual locations of the bodies where we found them. Let me see now. Pardon me. Yes. There've been two scientists, a policeman, a cannery worker. A barber, a gas station attendant, a real-estate broker and... a grade-school teacher. As you can see, there doesn't seem to be any occupational correlation involved here. However, there are three points of uniformity I would like to bring out and underline for you. One, all the victims have been men. Two, all the men have been residents of Peckham. And third, they've all died apparently... And I'd like to stress the word "apparently"... By over-exhaustion in the act of sexual intercourse. I've asked Dr. Murger here to express his opinions to us, because the possibility was thought to exist that some virulent form of venereal disease has been responsible. Doctor Murger? Venereal disease, which as many of you are undoubtedly aware... Louder! Venereal disease, which as many of you are undoubtedly aware, has swelled. Has swelled. Has swelled to epidemic proportions in the United States and in Western Europe. Frankly, I have never come in contact with, or heard of, any form of venereal disease which could result in the types of deaths we've encountered here in Peckham. However, I have a theory so complex, and so puzzling, that even to suggest it before I have the evidence... Therefore, in the interim, let me suggest a course of action. That a curfew, possibly sundown, be set up. Now, let me put it this way to civic, union, and religious leaders in this community. I must stress the importance of total... I repeat, total... Sexual abstinence. Hold it! Now, just hold it right there. This is the stupidest damn thing I've heard of yet. Eight guys are dead from ballin', and you don't even know what's caused it. Now, I agree with Sam here that you guys over at Brandt's what's done it! One of your goddamn experiments backfired on you, probably. Well, let me tell you something. Me, for one, ain't going to give up what little pleasure I get from screwing my old lady, or anybody else for that matter! Now, if we have to listen to some more crazy ideas, I'm leavin'! All right, all right, just wait a minute! Now, nobody is trying to legislate or dictate your private morals. Even if we wanted to, I don't think we could. All the man is doing is coming here and expressing a few opinions on how maybe we could save our lives. Now, on that basis, that isn't too much to ask, you sit down and listen, is it? You gotta be kiddin'! What about that up there? Huh? He wants us not to have it. Oh, you gotta be kidding. What are you gonna do when you get home tonight, huh? What are you going to do? Huh? Crawl in? Jeepers. Excuse me, Stan. Abstinence isn't going to be anything new around here. Well, if I were positive it was going to kill you, I'd do it. You know, those queers over at Brandt, they must think I'm plumb nuts, if they think I'm going to give an order like that one to our rank and file membership. You tell 'em, Barney! You know, being chairman of Local 723 may not mean a hell of a lot to those brains over at Brandt, but, damn it, at least, I got a little common sense. - Yeah, that's right, yeah. - Showed 'em tonight. Now, me and you boys, we've gone along with a lot of dumb-ass ideas in these last couple years. But this one takes the cake. That's for sure. Now, those guys, they freeze wages, and we gotta lie down and take it. Well, damn it, they ain't going to freeze anything else! You guys with me? - All right. - We're with you all the way. - Okay, here. Prost! - Drink it, drink it harsh! Drink to it. Mr. Braddock? Yeah? I'm Gretchen Grubowsky. I believe you knew my late husband. Mind if I walk with you? Well, we're a little early, but this is where Murger said he'd meet us. You know, Freud said, the idea of dying during or just after the sex act has an ambivalent appeal. You see, men, for the most part, have a desire for it, but, on the other hand, they fear it. It's true, like, there is such a thing as psychosomatic death. Okay, let's say that the first two deaths really were genuine cardiac arrests, okay? Now, who knows what dormant erotic fantasies that would stir up? You know what we might have here? Mass hysteria. You don't really believe any of that, do you? No. You know, I've never kissed a cop before. What's that? Let's take a look. Jesus, It's Dr. Murger. Oh, my God, they're killing him! Call Peters. What do you got there? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks, babe. - Agar! - Yeah? Any luck? You'll find a Plymouth, or what's left of the thing, where the bridge is out on the old highway. - Empty. - Empty? That makes nine. It makes ten. Ten? Barney Braddock. We found him with his pants around his ankles, dead of a massive you-know-what. All right, all right. Natives are getting restless. Yeah, I don't blame 'em. Look, take some of your men and find out whose car that was, will ya? Yeah, I already figured on doing that. I know you... you government heroes don't expect us local yokels to be able to do anything by ourselves, but we get along all right. Look, Peters. I know you've got a job. I got a job, too. - Right. - There are now three men dead at Brandt. Hey, Peters. Peters, I'm trying to say I'm sorry if I've been stepping on your toes. All right. I'm sorry, too. We're uptight. You're uptight, I'm uptight, we're all uptight. Really. They're dropping like flies, Agar. They're dropping like flies. - Great thighs. - It's got a motor. Yeah, hello, operator? I want area code 202, State Department 415. Let's go, Officers. Everybody! Home! Come on, now, it's all over. Yes, call me back here. Area code 805... 259... 9035. That's right, 9035. All right, thanks. Hey, it looks like this is going to take a while. Why don't you wait in the car? Okay. Where is it? In the lot right behind. All right. Be with you in a minute. Hello. Uh, yes, Neil Agar here. Mr. Secretary? Uh, yes, sir. I'm sorry to wake you up, sir. Ah, look at that. I'll take a baker's dozen, that's what I'll take. Now. You gals wanna play rough, huh? Is that it? Get... get her, get her, get her. That's it, she's a cutie pie. - Don't struggle, baby. - Don't fight it. No! Yeah, come on, come on. Yes, I know Murger's death wasn't like the others, but that, uh, that doesn't necessarily rule out a pattern. Yes, I know, sir. I... I... I don't know why, but I... but I'm sure it's connected with Brandt. Yeah, all right! Yeah, get you some. Get you some of that. Blow a little smoke at it, warm it up a little bit. All right, all right! You get you some of that? Yes, I'd recommend that we put up a military quarantine and cordon off this community. Right, sir. Well, thank you, sir. And I'll keep you appraised of any further developments. Right. Good night, sir. If you manage to do me in, there's two more fellas here that'd like to have a crack at you. Or maybe they just might cut you open and examine you as a medical phenomenon. Now, what do you think of that, huh? No! I'll get you, you son of a bitch! Neil! Neil, you can't! Neil! Neil! Stop it. I have a theory, so complex, and so puzzling... Joe. I was in town tonight when they found the body. But when I got over the shock, all I could think of was all the letters he had from me. The rest is history. How'd you meet? I drive a truck at the cannery. We met at Harm's bar. He used to come in there a lot before we, uh, settled down. Where were you tonight when Murger was killed? At Harm's, honest. I've got witnesses. I was supposed to see Henry tonight, but he telephoned and called it off. I was angry. I was hurt. So you went over to Harm's'? And you don't have any idea where Murger was tonight? None at all? He wasn't with a man. He was with a girl. I saw them as they drove through town early this evening. What she look like? I don't know. It was too dark. She was driving his car, that's all I could make out. You're sure, Joe? Well, what the hell do you think made me notice in the first place? Hey, tell me something, will ya? Um... Could he make it with a woman? No way. Hello. Mind if I join you? Please. How are you, Dr. Harris? Susan will do. Where is everybody? Locked in their rooms, I shouldn't wonder. Being thrilled at the latest chapters of the Phantom of the Rue Morgue. And you? Well, I deal in principles of geometry. Trigonometry, as in the survey. I'm afraid, uh, abstraction is more Dr. Williams' line, not mine. I seem to crave nothing but sweets of late. It's too bad. Well, what's too bad about it, Herbert? Well, you know, that's very bad for your appetite. You see, I was going to ask you... if you would have dinner with me tonight. I mean, that is, if you're free. Oh, I'm quite free, as a matter of fact. You mean, you will? Well, I must admit that since the curfew, Peckham's been more boring than usual. But I don't see why that should apply to us, do you? No. I mean, as long as we're discreet. Yeah. Great. Then, I'll cook you up something extra special. No scuttlebutt around here? Well, there was a rumor about Julie and him. I mean, it was just a rumor, not that anyone took it seriously. How well did you know Murger? How well did anyone know Murger? An introverted recluse. What can I tell ya? You, um, you going to Grubowsky's funeral tomorrow? Yeah. Well, he was a fine scientist. That'll be the little woman. Call it ESP. Hiya, darling. See? Oh, oh, oh... n... now listen, I, uh... I've got a summary of recovery operations tacked up on the board, so I'm... I'm afraid I'm going to be nose down and ass up for another couple of hours. So, uh... Curfew? For God's sakes, Nora, you're an eternal pessimist. Relax. Now, what should happen? Listen, darling, I've gotta run. No. No, don't wait up, okay? Yeah, tell me later. Yes, I love you, too. Domestic bliss, Mr. Agar. They got to know where you are every second. So, where are you off to? I'm, uh, meeting Julie Zorn. Oh, cute girl, if she'd only let her hair down, much too serious. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. We're about to explore the Antarctic and see what's beneath all that ice. Yeah. There, seems to be working all right. Now, tell me again what it is you're looking for. I don't know, it's just something Peters said. "They're dropping like flies". It's just a long shot. Let's go. Insects outnumber in species all the rest of the animal kingdom. Insects represent the highest grade of evolution among invertebrate animals, not only in terms of their complexity of structure, but also in their psychic development. - You mind if I smoke? - I'm allergic to cigarette smoke. Oh, well, it's just a bad... Sure you wouldn't like some dessert? No, I don't think so. See, I've got to watch my, uh... Just a taste? Well, uh... Hmm, just a... - It's good. - Another taste? The visual organs of insects consist of compound eyes. The entire image an insect sees, consequently, is a mosaic made up of as many units as there are facets to the cornea. Multiple vision occurs throughout the entire insect world. The complete metamorphosis of the insect to its adult state occurs within the pupa. Finally, the worker bees tear open the milky white pupa, allowing the queen to emerge. Here, the queen has been marked with a red spot. The survival of a hive depends upon a fertile queen. Many queens are developed until one can be made fertile. During her lifetime, the queen will lay up to 20 million eggs. Examples of the female killing the male during mating are numerous in the insect world. Here, the black widow awaits the arrival of her mate, and if the male, upon sexual contact, is not extremely nimble, his fate is sealed. The female praying mantis not only kills the male upon mating, but even proceeds to devour him. Similarly, the queen bee mates in mid-flight. Well, that's all the material I have on hand. Yes? Mrs. Kline? Yes? Your husband is in grave danger. He can't come to the phone, but he needs you badly. Who is this? Just do exactly as I say, or you won't ever see him alive again. Do you understand? Yes. There's some sort of social pattern here, but I just can't figure out what it is. Professor Norstad's the head of the etymological department here, isn't he? Yeah, but he's away in Europe. Susan Harris is acting head while he's gone. I think I should have a talk with her. Thank you. I want you to go on home. - But... - No buts. You've done enough for one day. This is Neil Agar, State Department Security. I'd like to speak to Dr. Harris if she's there, please. This is Dr. Harris. I'm sorry, but I'm very busy right now. Would you please come back during regular office hours? Uh, no, it's quite important that I see you now. All right. I'll be out in a moment. Hello, Dr. Harris. Look, I have a few questions I'd like to ask you. Well, I'm afraid that's impossible. We're in the middle of a very important experiment. We, Dr. Harris? Dr. Norstad and I. Oh, well, then, he's here? He's in London. At an entomological society convention. I'm working from his notes. Oh, I see. Look, Mr. Agar, I'll answer anything you like, just please be as brief as possible. I'm in the middle of an experiment. Dr. Harris, how many times does a queen bee mate? Only once. Just once? And only to reproduce. Once accomplished, she never mates again. Yes, thank you, Doctor. Calm down, it'll be all right. Take it easy. Calm down. Come on. You still able to recognize him as Herb Kline? Positively. I'd better go tell his wife. You feel like coming along? Uh, no, you take care of it. I'll be at Brandt. Hey, what's the trouble? Military quarantine, sir. You mean, I can't get through? Orders are to seal off the entire community, sir. But this is... hey, listen, I've got to chair a seminar at UCLA this afternoon. Sorry, sir. Our orders are quite specific. No one goes out or in. Well, this is ridiculous. Who ordered this cordon? Secretary of State, sir. - Captain Peters. - Mrs. Kline? Why, yes. Come in, come in. May I get you something? Coffee or juice? Oh, no, no, no, thank you. Actually, I've got some bad news for you, Mrs. Kline. Ah, at this hour of the morning? That would be considered shameful. Sit down, at least. - No, I... - Please. Uh, your husband is dead, Mrs. Kline. Herb, dead? Yes, we found his body at the factory this morning. The coroner should be calling in about a half an hour to ask you to identify the body. Well, if I don't seem shocked, Captain Peters, it's only because his passing comes as, uh, no great surprise. Dear Herb never was what you would call... a cautious man. Uh... I, um... I'm sorry to be the bearer of such bad news, Mrs. Kline. Well, if there's nothing else for me to do here, I... I'd better be going. No! Wait. Stay, stay awhile. Keep me company in my time of... ...need. Uh, no, Mrs. Kline... Oh... Mrs. Kline... Are you sure you won't change your mind? If you give me a couple of hours, I'll be able to do some research on... Just the man I want to see. Hey, Agar, what's with the SS troops? It's beyond my control. I've got to be at UCLA before three o'clock. - You're the only man that can... - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it. Oh, Christ. Hey, Aldo, talk some sense into this man, will you? Herb's dead, Stan. What? Like the others. Oh, my God. Okay, Agar, give me one good reason why in the hell any one of us should stay in this place. Calm down, Stan. Eh, just sit for a minute and listen. You're the geneticist, aren't you? Can you cross a man and a horse? You're asking me? Yes. I told him you'd get a centaur, mythologically speaking. Realistically speaking, you'd get a summons for bestiality. Come on, Agar, what's with the asinine questions? Look. Look, Williams, I'm serious. Now, what about controlled mutations? We're not ready or able scientifically to have the kind of controls necessary to alter the complex composition of genes and chromosomes... And... and there are metatheoretical considerations to examine and... Hey, with what we know now, it would still take centuries of trial and error. Okay, can you accelerate the process artificially? Impossible! No... Maybe. Maybe. Maybe the androgen and the estrogen hormones were artificially substituted by androgynous hormones, thereby rearranging the cellular structure. Now that... Hey, nobody's been able to do that before, except maybe Norstad and his goddamn bees. Right, right, exactly right. Norstad and his bees. Okay, uh.. I have a theory, and it's a wild one, and I'm going to need your help to prove it. I need some help! Can one of you guys help me? Come on! What's the matter? I lost my keys. I can't find them. Where at? Over there between those trees, I think. You're clutching at straws, Agar. That's not science, that's fiction. You can count me out. Williams, don't be so damn rigid. - I need... - Hey, take my advice, Agar. Go home, lie down. You're showing the strain. Bye, Julie. Aldo. Uh, there is an iota of credibility in your theory, you know. You mean, you'll help me? What do you want me to do? I want you to put all of this in analysis form, so I can send it to the State Department. All right. All right, I'll go home and put it on paper. How soon? Well, I'll rough out some notes and dictate it, Elvira will type it up for you before dinner... Um, it'll be ready. Great. Oh, uh, one more... One other thing... If this forced mutation, on the energy level that we're talking about, did occur, it should be detectable by a photosensitive gamma-count synthesizer. What the hell is that? It works like a camera. Mutated cells are infiltrated with a measurable degree of gamma radiation, which registers on a special photosensitive plate. Let's try it. Whatever you say. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth." "Yea," sayeth the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their works follow with them." "Behold, I tell you a mystery. "but we shall all be changed." "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: "for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible. and we shall be changed." "For we must all be made manifest "before the judgment seat of Christ; "that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad." "For we know that if the earthly house "of our tabernacle be dissolved, "we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." In as much as it has pleased Almighty God to take from among us our beloved brother, we commit his body to the earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, awaiting the final resurrection of our Lord. Now may the grace of the Lord, Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you and comfort you now and forevermore. Amen. Stan. Am I still not pretty? Yes. I know I've been a sexual bore, but I'd like to make it up to you. Could I still excite you? Unhook me. Yes. Come here. You! You're part of it! You and the others! Stan, what are you talking about? Stop it! Stan! Stan! Stan! Stan! Julie? Dr. Harris. I know what you've discovered, and I'd like to explain. It's really, very simple. I can only guess at the implications. I don't think a simple explanation will do. Well, perhaps not. But come to my office... and I promise you that what I show you, you'll be more than satisfied with it. You'll be safe. After all, you're a woman. Crossbreeding with other species produces a superior being. It's a well-known fact that thousands of drones are produced for the express purpose of impregnation. Uh, they are ultimately slaughtered... Well, hey, Dr. Harris, what are you doing here? I've wanted to talk to you alone for some time now. Julie. Halt, do you have identification? I have to get to Brandt. There's a Jeep down at the end of the line, you can take that. Right. Let me out of here! I've got to get out of here. Somebody, stop him. What's going on out here? Stop! Don't let him get away! Stop him! Get him! Don't let him get out of here! Halt! Stop! Stop where you are. Hold it. Hold it right there. Hold it. Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop! Get out... or I'll pull this lever, and Julie will be dead. Nobody moves. But I still don't understand what motivated them. Well, what Susan Harris didn't realize was that the radiation caused them to be sterile. So as a consequence, they were endlessly driven to repeat the mating cycle. Goddamn. You got that? Is she finished, Captain? Oh, yeah, well, why don't you both go get some shut-eye. I can wrap up things around here. Come on, I'll take you home. Agar, I hope I see you again sometime... ...as a tourist. Like Susan Harris is a good example. You know, just stretching beyond all the imagination of vanity... to the point where the mind is even functioning like in some kind of a plastic paradise. Where nothing can really exist. It's like... uh... the... Like to relax, for instance, I use self-hypnosis. And, like, I know the mind is like a computer, if I tell myself I'm gonna fall asleep at a certain time, I do, no matter what. And I wake up, and I tell myself positive things. I mean, it's very... It's very simple to do... because all you have to do is program yourself. I mean, it's very easy to relax with self-hypnosis. I mean, your mind is a computer. Seriously, how many times have you tried to fall asleep, and just before you're ready to go out, you tell yourself you're going to get up at six. Just before the alarm clock goes off, you get up automatically. I've really become a firm believer in self-improvement. I mean, like, after what happened to me the other night, there's a perfect example, I'm never going to get caught off-guard again. I'm going to take this course to improve my body and my mind. There's either kung fu or karate or tai chi. And I will be able to... In any given situation to take someone like you and just flip you right over my shoulder. Just.. No fair, no fair! You caught me off-guard! What were you saying? Oh, shut up.
