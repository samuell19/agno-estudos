The office is still receiving reports of missing people. The process of searching for victims of the earthquake and tsunami... At 3:00 p.m. Eastern Indonesia Time, there was an aftershock with... Let me just add something about the obstacles we face in carrying out the search and rescue around... Around Palu and its surroundings, including Petobo... The duration of the earthquake was about five to six minutes. So the duration of the earthquake was six minutes, Sir? Yeah, right. It happened so fast. His family must have panicked and so on. Yeah, they panicked. The analysis results show, this earthquake had a magnitude of 7,4... Where are the residents at this time? They are still outside the house and some areas are protected from the earthquake. They are in the mountains... - Dad. - Yes? It's not finished yet? I'll finish it when I get home from work. ...especially in Palu and the surrounding area. How is the situation? Are the obstacles... What is that, Dad? Earthquake in Palu. You know the person being interviewed? Not all SAR members I know. There are many SAR Teams. It's like... You know all elementary school students throughout Indonesia? Alright, I'll go now. Right, you go to school with... With Azizah. Well, if you're not home by 7:00 p.m., I'll pick you up. - Really? You remember the route? - Of course. Alright, I'll go now. - Don't forget to turn off the power. - Right. THE END IS NEAR - Please sit down, Mom. - Thank you. Yeah. Good morning, Sir. Please, come in. Good Pak morning. All of them are inside? Good morning Ma'am. Morning. - Morning Ma'am. - Good morning Ma'am. Morning! The drizzle last night made this morning feel gloomy. Sorry. It didn't hit you. Excuse me. Bye! Mrs. Amir is here! Morning Ma'am. Morning, Mrs. Mira. ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ Surprise! Happy birthday Honey! Excuse me, Ma'am. I want to give you... You must understand that offering solutions... must be detailed and spotted on from the start. - Yes Ma'am. - Why are there still so many unfilled? How can the client access the vendor in this way? Should I postpone e-procurement? - No? - No Ma'am. - Fix it. - Yes Ma'am. And that is not how you spell e-procurement. - Sar? - Yes Ma'am? Is there any good reason why my coffee is not here? Okay Ma'am. I'll make it. Sar. Sar, what's wrong? She hadn't seen it yet but she was already convinced that there was a lot wrong. Geez! There's a typo here! But this is still a draft, so it's okay if it's not detailed. But she didn't even see this first. - Sar. - Yes? - Where's the coffee for Mrs. Mira? - Oh my God, I forgot! Alright, I'll make the coffee now. Please give this to Mrs. Mira. Damn you! Still, huh? What's that Sar? Something for Mrs. Mira, maybe it's chocolate again. Then she will tell me to eat this. - Who is it from? - I don't know. There's never been a sender's name. Chocolate, flowers, of course it's from a man. Someone likes Mrs. Mira. Can you not mock Mrs. Mira? You used to be mad at her, but now you're defending her. You're weird, like your boss. - She's your boss too. - Morning. - Hello Mr. Rigel. Morning. - Where are you going? I want to go to Mrs. Mira's office. I want to give... I know, let me do this. Okay. - Pak Morning. - I've reviewed your proposal. Okay. You wrote a lot about how Southeast Asians became the most engaged mobile internet users in the world. Yes. There are actually 360 million internet users... I know, we know. But this proposal shouldn't be about the Southeast Asia market. This proposal is about you. Your vision and mission if elected... as Southeast Asia Representative for E-verything Group. Yes, I understand. And I already covered that... It's less specific and less persuasive. - Okay. - I want something new tomorrow morning. So that I can send it to Singapore immediately. - Okay. - Good. - Consider it's done. - Yes. Is this from your secret admirer? - Do you know what his name is? - Not yet. It's not important anyway. Are you taking a day off tomorrow? Good morning, Ma'am. You're taking the day off? Yes, there's my daughter's birthday party at her school tomorrow. You can replace Dede tonight, right? - Aren't you going to replace him? - Well, here's the thing. My wife suddenly has a fever this morning. - Pak Morning. - Morning. I plan to take her to the doctor this afternoon. Can you replace me? Just for a while. If there's something, just call me. I'll be here at 9. I guarantee you're home at 10 o'clock. Tonight I have to make a goodie bag for tomorrow. - Goodie what? - Goodie bag is... Morning Ma'am. - Goodie what? - Packages for children's birthdays. - A gift. - Yes, a gift. You can do it, you'll be home at 10. I got reports that the alarm went off last night. - Which floor? - This floor. But the alarm will usually be checked again after an earthquake occurs. It's the same as on the 12th floor. ...although everything is uncertain. The alarm will usually go off when there is a shock or fire. It hasn't been found. I hope nothing happens. Bro! By the way, we haven't practiced evacuation for a long time. You can replace me tonight, right? - Right? - Alright. Well, that's good. Thank you. Hi, Sis! - Let's go. - Right, your dad called me. He told me to pack a gift for your birthday tomorrow when we got home. Gift? What gift? It's a goodie bag. - Well, it's the same. - Dad will pack it. Your dad will be home late at night. Let's go. Now you are sulking? Don't sulk, you're so spoiled. Zah, what are you guys doing? We got an assignment from Uncle Adi, Mom. - Has Dinda eaten? - I've already eaten. What assignment is that? Sweep or mop? Digging a well. What did you say? Mrs. Mira. Are you sure you don't need my help with a proposal? You just go first. So, I can go home now? You can interpret for yourself what I mean. - Or do you need to learn again? - No Ma'am. I can. Okay. So... I'll go now. Excuse me. - Sari. - Yes Ma'am? Bring this home. I hope the proposal is good and you are sent to Singapore soon. Amen. At control room, CCTV room, basement. Mr. Yusuf, please check it. There will be a shift change. - You again? - Yeah, I'll replace Majid. - I mean Dede. Yeah. - Today your shift is double. You'll get a bonus and treat me. Well, not really. Hey! Hi Bro! - Alright, I will go around again. - Okay. Di! Please come back here at 7, okay? - I want to eat across the street. - Okay Bro. Alright then. Okay. Sar, you're home now? Please contact the security guard named... What's his name? Security guard on duty tonight. Tell him not to wait for me. I'm distracted and can't finish the proposal. I'm afraid I won't be sent to Singapore as soon as you want. Thank you. - Hello, Mr. Ilham? - Yes, hello. - Mrs. Mira is distracted by you. - Geez! Alright! You better go home or to your post. - Roger that. I'm sorry. - Alright. MOM - WHERE ARE YOU? PLEASE VISIT US, EVEN JUST FOR A WHILE I WON'T BLOW OUT THE CANDLES IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP Hi! You always go home late, don't you? Not really, just once in a while. But you often go home late. I'm Mika. And they say there's a great vibe. When we meet the right one. What? Try emergency, maybe. - May I? - Yes. - Do you mind? - Okay. Calm down, you don't need to panic. The elevator will usually run again about one to two minutes later. I'm not panicking, but I'm emotional. Okay. My name is Mira. Our names are similar. Mika... and Mira. I see you often. Well, I guess that's how it should be. Because we work in the same building and floor. Of the thousands of people who work here, I see you the most. Maybe the others never came to my mind. But that's how the brain works, right? The brain records what needs to be recorded. Is that right? Sorry, I... Do you work in the field of self improvement that often holds motivational seminars or a company that produces greeting cards? No. We both work on the 27th floor and there are two companies on the 27th floor, and I... I think it's been more than a minute or two. Okay. Is there a signal in the elevator? Just a reminder. Hello? - Is there anyone inside? - Yes, we are stuck. Okay, wait! - Bro? - Okay. Excuse me? Why are you sitting down? He told us to wait, so I'll wait. Gosh. Hello? - Hello? - Hello, Bandung... Seriously? Cut it out. Emotions will only waste your energy. Now you better calm down, don't panic. Then wait for them to come back here. Trust me, they will come back to help us. Okay. I work in a medical equipment company. So? I don't work for a greeting card company like you said. So? I'm just continuing the conversation. Medical equipment, okay. So are you a doctor? I am a Public Health graduate. I have a master's degree. Why are you looking at me like that? Then what should I look at? Only you are pleasing to the eye here. From the looks of it, you're the boss, huh? Business development manager, am I right? - How do you know? - It is obvious. I saw your name tag. Hello? Bro? Hello? Hello? Hello... That... Yes, keep pushing! - Back off! - Yeah, okay. Yeah, keep pushing! - Push it! - Okay. Help me, Mir. - Help what? - Pull this. - Hold on. - Keep pushing it! Keep pushing, Sir! Keep pushing! Come on, Mir! Okay! - Come on, Sir! - What am I supposed to do? Pull this! Yes, keep pushing! Mirkau Arundati... E-verything Group. Business Development Manager. Would you rather be given chocolates... or flowers? Bro! Are you okay? Bro! Help! Don't go! - Help! - Bro! - Hello! - Bro! Bro! Help! - Help! - Wait. You don't want to get out of the elevator because you're afraid of me, do you? Can we talk about your weirdness later? Am I weird? You always send me chocolates and flowers, right? - It's natural, right? - I don't like chocolate! - And I'm allergic to flowers! - Sorry. Bro! - Hello? - Then I'll send something else tomorrow. What is wrong with you? Are you sick? You try to open this from the inside. - Okay. - Please. I'm not sick. And I'm not crazy. Just so you know, I started liking you... Can you just shut up and do that, please? - Pretty please? - Okay. Maybe little bit... It's already... Fuck! Mika, can you go up there and check what's up there? I knew you would tell me to go up there. So, should I be the one who's doing it? Mrs. Mira whom I admire, I go home late so I can go home with you. Not to climb the elevator. I also didn't plan on getting stuck in an elevator with a psycho guy like you! I'm not psycho, I'm normal. Okay. Then you can go up there... open that and see what is up there. Like a normal guy. - Okay. - Thank you. - Could you help me? - What should I do with that? Hold it. Thank you. It's dark in here. Mika? Mika? I... You... Your leg is injured. Your leg is injured by the iron. You are also... Mik... You... You have to cover your wound first. Cover your wound first. You should cover your wound. And then you can help me. Mik... Mik... There's a shard of glass in your neck. Mik? Mika? Don't pull it out right away. - This... - Press the wound first. - Okay. - Okay. And then pull it out slowly. Mika! Oh my God! No! I'm sorry! Mika? No! Mik? Mika? - Forgive me, Mika. - This is not your fault. That's a big shard of glass. Mika! It's cold. Press here. Mika, stay! Hold it here! You'll be fine. Hold it here. Help! Hello? Mik! No! Mika! Mika? Mika! Mika, please say something! Say anything, even if it's seduction! Mika! Say something, please! "Something." Okay, good! Say it again! You say something to me. You know, Mika... I'm aiming for the position of South East Asia Representative. If I succeed, I will move to Singapore. I will no longer be in the same city with my mom and her husband. I will no longer be in the same city with my co-workers... who like to meddle in other people's business. And they changed my name to "Mrs. Amir" as they pleased. I will no longer be in the same city with the grave of the most passive man... I call "father". And you... You will no longer be... in the same building... with a man... With a man... who doesn't dare... to tell you how he feels. Mik, hang on! Mika? Mik? Please, hang on. Mika? Mika! Wake up, Mik! Mik... I don't want to be alone, Mik. Help! Help! Please don't leave me here alone! Please don't! No! Azizah! - There's an earthquake! - Dinda! Zah! What are you doing here? - Dinda, Mom. - Oh God! - Help! - Azizah, wait! Azizah! Wait! Where are you going? - Dinda! - Azizah! Hello? Hello? Is anyone stuck in the elevator? Yes! - Hello? - Ma'am... You don't have to press any buttons, I'll always be able to hear you. Damn you! Where have you been? I worked here for years and this never happened. - Why is this happening now? - Ma'am, now the situation is... Bro... - Someone died with me here! - Died in an earthquake? Earthquake? This building should be earthquake resistant! Ma'am, you know what floor you're on? Of course I don't know! I don't know, maybe the 20th floor. I've been here for two hours. - I'm stuck here for two hours! - Ma'am... Which elevator do you use? The elevator... Elevator B. I've been pressing the emergency button, but why is there no answer? - It's been two hours. - Sorry, Ma'am, but the situation is... I don't care about the situation outside! I've been here... - You said someone died. - Right! Are you hurt too? - Yes. - Which part is injured? - Bro, get me out of here quickly! - We need time, Ma'am. Please be patient. May I know your name? Is it important? I don't even care about your name. You should be here now, I'm in elevator B. Get me out of here now, I'll be out of air! This building's elevator meets safety standards. Just look up. There's ventilation so that the passengers do not run out of air. - Can you see that? - Whatever. You should come here now. Please. You said you're hurt. Where is your wound and how bad is it? Enough, just come here now. Now! Hello? There have been several earthquakes outside, Ma'am. The last earthquake was quite powerful, And even now, the evacuation process is still ongoing. Ma'am? Ma'am? - Ma'am? - Yes. Mira, my name is Mira. Mirkau Arundati. E-verything Group, 27th floor. Ma'am? You said someone died there with you. You know him? His name is Mika. He also works on the 27th floor. Medical equipment company. I tried to contact the SAR Team by radio, but there was no answer. Is there someone you want to call? Who can help me? Even you just appeared now. I will seek help. Bro? Mrs. Mira? Are you still there? Where else do you think I can go? There are a few questions I'd like to ask, Ma'am. When you went home, how many people in the office were with you? Mrs. Mira? Yes. I guess there was no one but me. Are you using a car? Yes. I parked at B1. Were you working overtime? You work late? No, I went home this afternoon. Of course I work late! Sorry, Ma'am. Are there any other questions that could open this elevator? Why are you working so late? Is your boss grumpy? I'm also a boss. That means your subordinates are grumpy. You don't even dare make them work overtime. What is your name? I haven't told you my name, my name is Adrian. Adrian Akbar. People like to say my name wrong, either Adri or Ardi. So I told them to call me Adi. And what about you? You want to call me Ardi, Adri, or Adi? But if you wanna call me Akbar, it's okay. It's up to you. Mrs. Mira? This is not the right situation to do multiple choice. Do you have another nickname? My co-workers call me Mrs. Amir. Really? Well... They don't do it in front of me. They are afraid. They do that behind my back. Because you are... Sorry, 'cause you're like a man? Because I'm grumpy and firm. So grumpy and firm is synonymous with men? Well, maybe. Actually, they are millennials. But their mindset is conservative. Where exactly are you, Adi? Finally, a question from you for me. Well... I have to start to accept the situation... of talking with people whose faces I don't know. I'm in the control room, Ma'am. So you were able to see me through the CCTV all this time? Unfortunately I can't. All the monitors here are off. That's why I asked where your wound is and how bad it is. Because I can't see anything. My wound has started to numb. Are you afraid of tight spaces? If I was afraid of tight spaces, I would have passed out a long time ago. Dark spaces? No. Then what are you afraid of? Being stuck in an elevator with a guy I just met. I didn't mean to be funny. Sorry. But it's better to be stuck in an elevator for life... than to be stuck in guilt for life. I was just trying to be funny. - You failed. - Well, I knew it. From your voice, it sounds like you've calmed down. You can talk like that because you're not here. If I could choose, I'd be there. So I don't have to imagine who I'm talking to. What am I like? What do you mean? Well, what do you imagine me like? You have long hair. And you are tall. You smell good. I'm not fat, am I? It's true, women don't like being called fat. No wonder my wife used to be angry when I said she was fat. She didn't want me to touch her, not even kiss her. She even pushed me. Adi... You already called your wife, right? My wife died two years ago. Sorry. Why are you apologizing? I've made you remember things that make you sad. Without being asked, I always remember her. Forgetting our mistakes is not that easy. I was so busy saving other people... that I didn't realize my wife needed help too. My wife was sick for months... and I didn't realize that she was seriously ill. And how about you? You don't want to call your husband? Your kids, or your parents? Ma'am? Ma'am? Well, I... No signal here. And there's no one I want to call. Then do you imagine how I am? - I don't. - Okay, no problem. You're tall. You have a mustache. Your skin is dark. Is that right? I am not handsome. When you see me, you definitely don't want me to hold your hand. Like my late wife when she was cranky. I think, whether handsome or not... I don't want to come into contact with people I don't know. Do you have children? Adi? Adi? Adi? Adi? Are you still there? Adi? Adi? Adi? Adi? The emergency light has gone down! Mrs. Mira. Hello Mrs. Mira. I've read your message. But I don't understand, because there are a lot of typos. Please check before you send it. You're wasting paper. Mom! Please help me, Mom! Mir, it's been a long time since you last came home. You don't miss me? Help me, Mom! Please come here. Pick me up now, okay? Now, okay? Mom? Hello? Hello? The cleanest woman in the world. Hello, Mrs. Mira? Hello? Can you hear me? Ma'am? I think communication is getting interrupted. Mrs. Mira? I haven't heard anything from you since then. Mrs. Mira? Hello? I have a child, Ma'am. A daughter. She's having her 9th birthday tomorrow. I've taken leave. I was planning to celebrate it at her school. Please get me out of here quickly. I promise to give a present to your daughter. I promise. My daughter doesn't need a present. She needs her father. Hello? Adi? What's wrong with the communication channel? This is an emergency line. It doesn't require electricity. It's okay then. Just get me out of here quickly. Sorry, I... I can't yet. Why? Why? I'm sorry. Adi? - Yes, Ma'am? - What was your late wife's name? Nur. It's Nurmala, Ma'am. My mother's first name is also Nur. But her full name is Nuraini. She was called Nani since childhood. Today is my mom's 55th birthday. Is she throwing a party Ma'am? Yes. Just a small party. Actually I was hesitant to be there. Turns out I really wasn't there. Since I was little, every time it was my mother's birthday... We would always blow the candles together. Actually I don't like it. And then... Since my mother remarried, we... We've never... blown candles together again. Tonight... We should go back to that habit. But you don't like it. ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Happy birthday, Mom. I... I promised to come home early today. I wanted to prepare for her birthday. Tomorrow... You will still be able to celebrate your daughter's birthday. Mrs. Mira? The electricity had only been on for a while, but then it went out again. The elevator was going really fast! Adi! Please help me! I don't want to fall! Do you know what floor you are on now? I don't know! I don't want to fall! I'm scared! I don't want to die! Help me, Adi! Alright. Are you afraid of heights? No, I'm afraid to fall! I'm afraid to fall! I'm... - Calm down, Ma'am. - Help me! Calm down, the elevator won't fall. What's the guarantee that this lift won't fall? What if it falls? Mrs. Mira. Your elevator won't fall down. Modern elevator safety systems are just like seat belts. Even if there is a shock that makes the lift fall... the system will work and make the lift brake automatically. I can't understand your words anymore. Alright. The point is... you don't have to be afraid. You know the difference between a fear of heights... and a fear of falling? Well... What do you think? Fear of heights is the same as fear of the dark... fear of tight spaces, or fear of animals. There is therapy for that. It can be removed and cured. The therapy is... The patient is confronted with the thing they fear... over and over again until they're no longer afraid. Right. And therapy for fear of falling? Actually the fear of falling is the same as the fear of pain. - The therapy... - For life. We can be exposed to pain hundreds or thousands of times in our lifetime. But we can never come to terms with the pain. Yes, Ma'am. Your dad's helicopter crashed. Why are you crying, Ma'am? Dad? My dad is... a helicopter pilot in a private company. He often received sudden guests. The relationship between my mom and dad was... Well, my mom had a boyfriend. My dad didn't know about it. But I did. On my 10th birthday... My dad took me around Jakarta at that time... by helicopter. I was so happy. He told me everything. We saw various places from above. But finally, I told my dad that my mom had a boyfriend. Then when we got home... I thought they were going to have a fight. Turns out they didn't fight. But my dad was silent. Then two weeks later... His helicopter crashed. My mom and I were not allowed to see my dad's body. Because his body was very bad. But my mom didn't insist on seeing it. If I die in a bad state... I don't want Dinda to see my body. Then at my dad's funeral... I finally told my mom... that Dad knew she had a boyfriend. Mom just looked at me. Okay then. That's all. Many things were not finished at that time. Actually, Adi... To me, the most handsome man in the world is my dad. My daughter also often says that to me. Yes. I'm sure your daughter is right. Mrs. Mira. You said that... I could celebrate my daughter's birthday. How can you be so sure? You're the one who reassured me that everything would be fine. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Did I say that? Well, you didn't say it outright. But I know... For hours here, that's all you've been trying to do. So... Adi, apart from saying that her father is handsome... Has your daughter ever said that her dad has a very nice voice? That's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard. Adi. The emergency light is off. Calm down. You are not alone. This is the last victim. - Wait! - Yes, Ma'am? Please check the control room. - Control room? - Yes, CCTV room. - Can! - Yes? - Have you checked the control room? - It's already ruined. We can't get in there. - No way! There is... Wait! - Alright. There is a victim. He is my friend, his name is Adi. - Please check it now. - Calm down, Ma'am. - Check it again. - Alright. - You just calm down, Ma'am. - I... Alright, Ma'am. Don't move too much. - But, please wait. - Alright, we'll wait. - Just take a rest, Ma'am. - What are we waiting for? - Please wait. - Okay, we will wait. Alright, lie down and relax. Just calm down, okay? He was unconscious for two hours. He used to be our co-worker in the SAR. Sorry, Sir! - Let's search for the other victims. - Okay. Adi! Hey, are you okay? Mira? Mir! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Happy birthday, Ma'am. Daddy! It's okay. I'm okay. Dinda, it's okay. Let's invite your friends to the hospital, okay? Which hospital is it? Who did you come here with? Azizah? So? You came here alone? Really? Good girl. - Azizah brought you here? - Right. Where is she? She went home because she wanted to help her mom clean the house. The room is good, right? It's expensive, huh? My office paid for it. No matter how comfortable it is here, it's still more comfortable at home. The nurse said there would be a party this afternoon. Right, we are preparing the goodie bags. The nurse told Aunt Mira to give a present or... To invite her. You mean you want me to help with the goodie bags, huh? You wanna do it? Thank you. Goodie bags! Okay, how many people do you want to give a goodie bag to? Is it a lot? Well, one class. - How many? 25 people? - Yeah, right. - Okay. - See? What's wrong? - You want this? - Yes. - So that your hands are clean. - Right. Now... Well, good. Does Dinda's dad also want this? There. Come on, when will we start?
