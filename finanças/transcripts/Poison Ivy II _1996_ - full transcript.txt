Whether it's primitivism or romantic realism or postmodern deconstructivism, the same rules apply. Everything is governed by the laws of nature. Nowhere are the principles and laws more perfectly manifested than in the human form. Excuse me. Um, is this the, uh... Life study. Wait a minute, don't tell me, let me guess. Lily Leonetti? You're two weeks and 30 minutes late. Sorry. Family emergency. That's all right, come on in. Want to get set up over here? I don't think Catherine's coming back. All right, let's try to stay focused, folks. I'm talking about learning the rules before you break them, specifically perspective and proportion as it relates to the human body, which brings us back to Isabel.

Well, the world of bikes is calling. Gotta run. (lovely cello music) (pleasurable moaning) (suspenseful music) (phone rings) Hello? [Lily's Dad] How's L.A, kiddo? Hi, dad. It's good. It's nice. [Lily's Dad] Well this place feels pretty empty without you. Hold on, your mom wants to talk to you. Okay. [Lily's Mom] Lily. Hi, mom. [Lily's Mom] Did you find your surprise? Hold on a sec. What is it? [Lily's Mom] It's just a little something to remind you of us. You know, I don't know why you have to go all the way to LA. To be an artist. We could've bought you a car if you went to State. Mary Jane, you know Catherine's daughter, she went to State, and she's very happy making all sorts of arts and crafts. Mom, do we have to have this conversation again? Where's daddy? [Lily's Mom] Bob? Oh, he's gone off somewhere. Okay, well, um, I gotta go. [Lily's Mom] Go? We just got on.

I mean, from this masterpiece you've just created, it's obvious that you've transcended all need for traditional forms. No. This, my fellow students, was created out of no other tradition but that of boredom. (students laughing) This, this is an A plus. This is a perfect example of 100% surrender to the process of tradition. It's so lifelike that you can almost fuck it. (students laughing) You through? Want to get back to work? (concerned music) Jackass. (afflicted music) Lily? You okay? Yeah. (veiled music) (knocking on the door) [Gredin] Lily? Yeah? [Gredin] Can I come in? No. I'm not dressed.

[Woman On Phone] I understand you're looking for a babysitting job. Bridgette, shut that shit off! Bridgette! (banging) I'm gonna kill her. You want to help? Good. I was thinking fat pills. She's always saying how if she gains one more pound, she's gonna kill herself. Suicide, very good. Thank you, thank you very much. You know what? What? I got a job. Doing what? Babysitting. Well, how totally sweet. (laughs) It is! She hates me. I'm an insensitive male. You two know each other? We do, but she might not want to know me now. Tell her I'm not half had, Tanya. I wish I were half as good as you, Gredin. Come on, I'll make it up to you. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? (relaxed music) I got carried away with Donald. I shouldn't have put you in the middle of it. No, uh, I probably overreacted. I can sometimes be hypersensitive. You shouldn't be. You got it. Yeah. The only person in class whose hand the teacher has to hold. Literally. [Gredin] Well Falk has a weakness for his female undergrads, especially when they look like you. What is this? [Gredin] This is my magical craft. I'm sorta hoping it'll win me a Guggenheim. You'll get it. You psychic? No. You deserve it. So where were you the first two weeks? Well, when I applied I never thought I'd get accepted, and I was, and I just freaked. No big family emergency. Just my own little private one. That's all. That's enough. You, uh, see that hill over there? Mm-hm. That's Beverly Hills, that's my home. Might as well be Timbuktu. My father and I, we don't talk anymore. (woman giggling) What are you thinking? I'm making a wish. What are you wishing? That I could just open my eyes and be different. Silly me. I'm listening. (sentimental music) And I like doing that. You're beautiful. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. You're sweet. You're beautiful. And different. (awestruck music) Um... Lily. (doubtful music) [Ivy Voice-over] March 1st. How do you know what you can do until you do it?

Besides, I have a lot more to offer than just my fine young body. I have it up here. That's, uh, too bad, because all I was really interested in was your body. [Gredin] Same time, same place? [Lily] Maybe. (bright music) Hey there. Hi. Well, what do you think? It's, uh, intense. Either something very tragic or terribly exciting is happening in your life. See, women only change their hair when it's one of the two. Oh. (laughs) I don't know, I, I think I was just bored. Oh come on, I bet it was something exciting. [Lily] Like what? I confess, I'm not really a fortune teller. You have a such a pretty face. You shouldn't hide it behind that new hairstyle. Donald? Hey. Hey. Thought I'd find you here. Lily, meet Angela, my wife. Angela, this is Lily. Hi. Our new babysitter. Hi, nice to meet you, Lily. (Daphna giggles) 12 Mississippi. 13 Mississippi. 14 Mississippi. 15 Mississippi. [Daphna] I'm ready! 16 Mississippi. [Daphna] Lily, hurry up! 17, 18, 19, 20! Daphna? Daphna? (mysterious music) (Daphna giggles) Boo! (Daphna screams) Gotcha! Oh, I must say, Daphna, you are a great hider. [Daphna] Thank you. Oh you're welcome. (serious music) Those are pictures of daddy's old paintings. He doesn't like to paint anymore. Why? Mama says it's because painting makes him crazy. (Lily laughs) [Donald] Daphna? I'm gonna hide again. Where are you? Wait, Daphna. Hi. Hi. Hello? Hello? Hi. Hi, sweetie. Hi. Hi, Lily. (kissing) [Donald] What you been up to? [Angela] Uh, I did a portrait. Great. Angela's getting back into her photography. She always said she'd give Daphna four years, but lucky Daphna got a full seven. Right. Um, why don't you take Lily home? Should be getting back. [Daphna] Mom, I'm hiding and no one's come to find me! (Lily laughs) Bye, Lily. Bye. [Donald] Come on, I'll give you a lift. [Radio DJ] And now from L.A's best station for the sound of jazz, another 30 minutes of uninterrupted... So. (laughs) So, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself, Lily? Where was it you said you were from? (laughs) You'll laugh. Kalamazoo, Michigan. (Donald and Lily laughing) Born and bred. And stifled. Wow, that's a big move, huh? All the way out to California by yourself? I was really scared at first, you know, but I think I made the right decision. Definitely. Can't afford to be afraid at your stage of the game. Right up here? Yeah, that's it. Well, I guess I better let you out. Thanks a lot. [Donald] Your bag. Thanks. Listen, if you want to, uh, show me some of your other work sometime, I'd love to see it. Like when, like after class? Yeah. I'm in the studio every afternoon by the faculty building. Okay, yeah. Maybe I'll do that. All right.

(Lily coughs) You don't like it? No. No, I think you look incredibly sexy. I'm glad you like it. Did Donald like it? I saw him drop you off. Seems like you're becoming a regular teacher's pet. No. Just his babysitter. Do you still think that I'm different? Beautiful? Yeah. May I? Mm... Okay. (kissing) May I?

[Donald] Good student. Student? Well, you're still very cautious. And careful. You know, it's, it's sort of funny to me the way you can teach and judge and yet you yourself no longer paint. You think that's funny? (laughs) No, actually I think it's bullshit. Mmm... What do you propose to do about it? I don't know. See, to be an artist, you know, to be a serious artist, you have to be willing to sacrifice everything. You have to confront your demons and go into battle with them. That's what I want. I'm ready for that. Really? I lost a few battles along the way myself. That's why I stopped painting. Well then, maybe I can help you face your fears and you could help me face mine. You sure? Sit down. Do it. Take off your clothes. (Lily laughs) Does that prospect frighten you? Yeah, a little. Then all the more reason to do it, right? Okay.

What do you want me to do, stand in front of the class for the rest of my life and yak about something that I don't have the guts to do anymore, like a fucking hypocrite? - Donald, that's not... what we're talking about here. Well what are we talking about? I don't want to lose you again, and especially not to some 20-year-old undergraduate who looks at you like you're God and, and poses between fucks. You and Daphna are my life, and I love you very much. We've both been fooled by that before, haven't we? Last time nearly killed us, Donald. Whatever. (troubled music) Well, where were you today? What do you mean? You weren't in class. Neither was Gredin. Any connection between the two? You know, I'm gonna go, because this is... Wait wait, just tell me. Were you with him? Yes. Wait. Don't go. I don't want you to go. I can't let you go. I can't stop thinking about you. I'm painting again for the first time in years and it's because of you. I've never felt this way before in my life. Help me overcome my fear. Big scaredy cat. Not anymore. Don't. What are you doing? [Donald] Kissing you. Falling in love with you. Don't. Why? Just don't. (fretful music) Come here.

But I'm not confused anymore. (hopeful music) (Lily laughs) Please don't give up on me. (gleaming music) (doorbell rings) Well don't just stand there, Donald. Invite them in. Angela, hi. Hi. This is Gredin. He was kind of homeless, so I invited him. I hope you don't mind. No, no, not at all. Hi, Gredin. Pleasure. Um, do you two know each other? Yeah. He's in my class. Oh, well, we've got the posse. Wow, it smells great in here. Can I do anything? You can set a place for Gredin. Okay. Hi, Lily. Hey, little one! [Daphna] Can I ask you something? [Lily] What? [Daphna] Is Gredin your boyfriend? [Lily] Gredin's my boyfriend. [Gredin] Is that you? Yeah. Yes, it is. Um, Donald painted that a long time ago now, but that's me. Come in. Come on. I'll show you around. (smooth jazz music) Very good. Very nice. Why didn't you tell me you were inviting Lily? I thought I did. [Donald] You didn't. All set. [Gredin] Need some help? Yeah. Thanks. Wow. Did good with this one, Lily. [Lily] (laughs) Thanks. You bring the cranberries for me? Mm-hm. [Angela] Lily, grab the mineral water, would you? It's in the fridge. [Lily] Sure. I'm glad you here. I wanted you here. Where are you going? Into the other room. Where do you think I'm going? Wait just a second. Don't. Just let me look at you. Why did you bring him? Because he's my boyfriend. So, Gredin, why don't you sit over here, Lily next to Gredin. Daphna, you're here beside Lily. Donald, you're over here next to me. Do you have a cake for Johnny? Of course. (bells gonging) I'm finished, mom. I'm gonna hide. Fine, honey, you go ahead. 50 Lily tells me you're a photographer. Mm, I used to be. Making a comeback. And you're a painter? I'm a sculptor mostly. An amazing sculptor. With an aversion to life study. [Gredin] That's not entirely true. Really? News to me. Me and Donald agree on a couple things. Like your beauty for example. I've never seen your work before. It's good. It's amazing what you can do with the right subject. Donald's painting again. For the first time in a long while. He's quite... Let me get some more wine. Serious about it. It's a secret. 50, um, how did you and Donald meet? Wow. (laughs) Uh, I, I wanted to do a life study class. I, um, heard about this single, brilliant, good-looking professor, and, um, weaseled my way into his class. The rest is history. Bit of a cliche I know, but... Some more? Yeah, thanks. Angela was just telling us how the two of you met. For god's sakes, hon, let's not bore them with our trivia. I never actually thought of it as trivia, Donald. Where's Daphna? Sound asleep. [Donald] She should be in bed, shouldn't she? [Angela] Yeah. Come on, sweetie. Let's go. Here, I'll take her. No, I want daddy and Lily to take me. Mm, well. Good night. (bells ringing) Let me give you a hand. Yeah, thank you. (Donald grunts) There you go. Sleep tight now, beautiful. Okay. [Lily] Good night, little girl. Good night, big girl. What are you doing?

Beautiful. And sexy. Fearless. And it worked. For the first time in my life, I was accepted. (touching music) And I became intoxicated by the freedom of it all. Until it was too late.
