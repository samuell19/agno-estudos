Listeners, what makes you stay in this horrible city, Jakarta? The traffic, the floods, the crime... No sidewalk free from motorcycles. Robbery in the cabs. Rape in the public bus. Why do you still stay here? I'll read some tweets from you listeners... because there is no star in its night sky. Then why are you still here? If you want to see the stars, move to the mountains. Next is from @juls. They say, "Of course, it's the money. You can make money off anything in Jakarta. Even toilets." She's so right. Yesterday I wanted to pee, and I had to pay ten cents. Twenty cents for taking a shower. Hi, Gia! Hi, Auntie. You've put on weight! Blame it on the huge food portions in the States. Your skin is too dark. Try this rainbow cake! It's the new trend in Jakarta. Thanks, Auntie. How come you woke up so late? I'm still jet-lagged. She's still in the New York time zone. Something to drink, Gia? Mom, I'll make my own coffee. Tini! Brew some coffee! Caffeine is bad for women. - It can impair our fertility! - Really? Well, I don't plan to have kids. What? Don't be crazy! You've changed. So American! Don't wait too long. You're in your 30's. I know someone perfect for you. His name is Davit. He owns a minibus company, right? And a taxi company! His new house is 1000 square meters, three stories, with an elevator! Give me your Blackberry PIN, I'll pass it to him. I don't own one. What? Everyone has a Blackberry in Jakarta. Mrs. Surya! I can't believe Mr. Surya is gone. He was still very young. A very nice and noble man. Don't be sad. Remember what Jesus said. "For God so loved the world..." I appreciate it. I've asked Father Paul to come to our church on Sunday. To console you. I can't. Maybe next time. Oh no! Father Paul has traveled from out of town just for you. OK. I'll stop by. Praise the Lord! Anyway, it's a voluntary act for Father Paul. But as a noble Christian, we must give back. How about 100 dollars for his time and trouble? Fine. I'll transfer the cash. Wonderful. Here's something to reflect upon... So you'll understand more about God's Miracle. - I'll pick you up on Sunday. - OK. The Minister of Religious Affairs believed I would be a good legislative candidate. Praise to God. This is God's way for me. What is your view on the legislation based only on religion? I don't understand it. It's not my business. You acted in a horror film containing sex scenes. Will this jeopardize your campaign? I was in a religious movie as well. Good evening. Have a great work out! THIEF OF HEART CANT WAIT 2 C U 2NITE INDRI STARS FINALLY... THIEF OF HEART U'LL B WEAR1N MINISKIRT, RITE? INDRI STARS WHATEVER TURNS U ON THIEF OF HEART I HAVE A HARD ON... I HAVE A HARD ON... THIEF OF HEART MAY I JERK OFF? THIEF OF HEART GIMME A PIC OF UR TITS Evening... Next Monday at nine? Sure. I've ballooned since I got back from Korea. I'll make you sweat. You naughty boy... Towel! Bye. Upan, you're still whoring? No way. I'm just "training" her personally. Look what she gave me! Ask for an apartment instead! Hurry, before she realizes you're a fag. Get one in Singapore. In the Woodlands area. Should I? I have a date tonight! He lives in a three-story house with an elevator! Naomi... Gia? Wait a sec. I'll call you back. I was in a middle of a major drama. My shoes... Tonight? What about after nine? To avoid traffic. Baby... ...you're a whore! You're such a slut. Do you want to get raped on a bus? WOMEN ONLY TRAIN - Daddy, buy me a Blackberry. Please? - OK. Welcome to Lone Star. How many hours will you be staying? What do you mean? We have a two-hour room, six hours, or... I'll stay till morning. You must book for one whole night. No problem. You have a reservation? Under Mr. Davit. You can wait inside until Mr. Davit arrives. Can I help you? I think my friend is already inside. I'm sorry, but we have a dress code. Shirts for men, and women must wear a dress. I'm sorry. Those are our house rules. Gia? Reservation under Naomi. Miss Naomi. Please, come in... Thanks. Here's the menu. Someone stole my shoes at the gym! So much drama! Or else I'd be barefoot! But running shoes don't belong here... It's impossible. Actually, running shoes will be perfect with your outfit. But then with the strict dress code... Good evening. For your purse, ma'am. Thank you. Good evening. Ready to order? I, uh... I'll have... mineral water. We only serve Fiji Water. Then I'll just have iced tea. - I'll have iced chocolate instead. - We have a special iced chocolate. - That's it. - OK. Anything else? Maybe some appetizers? Our favorite is the chicken soft roll. What the hell is that? Actually, it's just spring rolls. - All right, sure. - OK. - Excuse me. - Ya. Good evening. Ready to order? May I assist you? Our chef recommendation is the New York steak. You can choose sirloin or tenderloin. You can even choose the meat. New Zealand, Australia, or US. It's called New York steak, but the meat comes from New Zealand? Yeah... I'll have local beef instead. We don't serve local. It's not as delicious. - I'll have a glass of "Rambutan-tini". - Rambutantini. Sure. It's Rambutan in a Martini. - OK. - I'll have a glass of water. You want one? We only serve Fiji Water. - It's imported water. - Oh. - I'll take it. - Excuse me. This is Jakarta. Things get easier when we pretend to be foreigners. I don't have to reserve for a table, or wait in line to get into clubs. How many days will you stay here? Well... all my friends do. Why did you come back? I still wonder why... But you have a green card. You can go back any time you want. Excuse me. Double Rambutantini. Thanks. Indri Stars? Thief Of Heart? Davit. Indri. Let's move to that table. - Good evening, Mr. Davit! - Evening. - You're doing well, sir? - OK. We've prepared the Wagyu steak for you. Anything else for you, ma'am? Get her the same order. Wait, you want something else? No. And one iced chocolate. One iced chocolate... And two Wagyu steaks with rice. No rice for me. One order without rice. - May I take the menu? - Sure. No rice? Afraid of getting fat? I'm not hungry. Why so quiet? You were talkative in the chat room. Why? Disappointed? Am I different? You're very different from the photo. I told you that was an old picture. Excuse me. One Wagyu steak without rice. Enjoy. Where can I jog in Jakarta? The National Monument Park? I had no choice but to join the gym. Excuse me. Can you take our picture? Sure. - You know how to use it, right? - I do. - From this angle? - Yup. A bit further left. One... two... - Once more? OK. - Sure. One, two... Thank you. Lovely. - Anything else? - No, thanks. OK, excuse me. I'll post it on Path. What's your Path? One moment. Why do Jakartans have two cellphones? The network sucks. So, we need different providers. So nice to see you here! Come join our table! Come! Let's join my friends! Wait. Naomi... Naomi, you should wear low-cut dresses more. Once you give birth, your boobs are gonna sag. - Go to doctor Edward! - Hell no! They banned him in Bangkok. - How come he's allowed to work here? - No shit? Girls, my hubbie is in celebratory mood. Thanks to the all-time high rice price. Oh my God. We should go to Macau and party hard! Girls, this is Gia. She's a filmmaker from New York. - Hi. - We went to college together. - Hi. - Hi. She can be the photographer for our cupcake website. Sure. But I expect a friendly price. Check out Kris' new post on Path. - Gallardo. - Damn! - So nice. - Lamborghini? Re-Path and let Fifi know. She thinks she's the only one who can afford it? Who the hell does she think she is? Before she married Roy... - She lived in Rawamangun. - Oh my God. She was only an elementary school teacher! Picture time, bitches! Girls! Use your head, dickhead! Give them some booze, Happy 5, or some Uzbekistan whores... Until they sign the contract! Dumb fuck! Finish your steak. I already booked a room. A hotel room? Lone Star. It's close by. I can't. I have to meet a friend. That's not what you promised. How about next time? I'm tired. You're rejecting me? Look at her! A US graduate and desperate to marry me. You're just a salesgirl! I'm not! I work in public relations! Liar! Other salesgirls are much prettier than you! They are more than willing to fuck me... for 200 bucks a pop! You're not even worth 50 bucks! You worthless whore! Excuse me! Here's your bill. I thought he already paid. He left. Your PIN, please? It's rejected. Try again. Your PIN? You have another card? Maybe it's the magnet. Try this other card. Ma'am! Security! Grab her! Yes, Mom. I'm with Naomi. Don't worry. I'll be home soon. This is nuts. She treats me like a child. It happened to me, too, just after came back here. My mom wouldn't let me go out alone. She feared it was dangerous. That I would get raped. I... But I can't stay inside another aquarium. What aquarium? Gia, it's late. It's dangerous outside for us girls. What if we just drive around? What about my driver? Shall we ask him to wait? Who's gonna take us home? What? Come on! But I can't go out wearing this. Didn't you go to the gym earlier? SOFIA PERFORMING TONIGHT Welcome to Lone Star. My name is Sofia, and I will accompany you as long as the sun sleeps. Miss, where are you going? Do you need a ride? You sure it's here? I think so. There's another hawker around the Gondangdia area. You sure you want to eat street food? You'll get diarrhea. No worries... We're giving it a try. It's the new trend in Jakarta. I don't bake. Then why did you bother to study in New York? It's different here. You have to be practical in Jakarta. Being an artist is never appreciated. I'd rather become the patron of the arts. The city is also very draining. The traffic, especially... There's no energy to be creative anymore. Every weekend, I would rather escape. To visit South America? I'm amazed you still remember. When? I'm going there in April for vacation. I wanna come! Let's eat in Gondangdia. How about we find something close by? Wait. Ma'am, where are you going? - Why the hurry? - It's late. Who are you looking for? Do sit down... What brings you here, darlin'? Is Sofia around? You're looking for Sofia? She's with a client. You want her? You should book in advance. She's a bestseller among government officials. I can't figure out why. She looks rotten. But everyone who's been with her keeps coming back for her pussy power. I don't want to book her. She's my friend. She's your friend? A friend? Friend? Next time I see her, I'll tell her you were here. FRIED RICE COCONUT MILK RICE FRIED CHICKEN ROASTED DUCK Why do these instant noodles taste better? Not like when you make it at home. It's different. You know why? One. They cook it for you. Two. With their sweat mixed inside. - With pollution as the added ingredient. - Yeah. Wait for it. You should try mine. Instant noodles with cheese. Do you remember our life without smartphones? How did we live back then? All my friends' three-year-old kids already use an iPad... What did we do without iPads when we were kids? Tazos! Those round circular disks? Freebies inside snack balls bags? And then... We filled each other's scrapbooks... Swapped perfumed papers! I miss the smell! Rock-Paper-Scissors! - Rubber band games! - Rubber band games! Ma'am, can I borrow a rubber band? Thanks. Let's give it a try! I still remember it. This way... Like this. - Am I doing it wrong? - That's not it! I can't believe I still remember it. How does it feel, going back home? Just after I arrived, My old room, from before I went to the US. Nothing's changed. The same old books, clothes... pencil case... posters... It reminded me of the young Gia... In her high school uniform... I was so innocent... Life was so carefree... COFFEE AND INSTANT NOODLES STALL Ma'am... You want one? Only 20 bucks. Oh no. She's wasted. Ma'am, it's Sofia. Yes. That's her husband. She's married? - Who are you telling me what to do! - Hey! I thought you were good friends? How come he allows her to be a prostitute? Where have you been, girl? Her husband is also... a gigolo. Ma'am? MOTORCYCLE TAXI - Motorcycle taxi? - The driver just left... Aren't you the lady who ran away from the restaurant? Calm down, Miss. Why are you crying? Don't cry here. People will be alarmed. Come, sit down. Anything to drink, miss? Wait. That's mine! Give me one more glass. Stop crying, please. Thanks. You really like iced chocolate, don't you? What the hell? You also ordered iced chocolate in Lilo. Was it good? This one's better. That one got me drunk! I made it! No wonder it tasted like shit. Well, I'm no bartender. The bartender didn't show up. I had to cover his shift. It turns out, it's pretty easy to mix drinks. Why did Mr. Davit leave you alone? I thought you were his girlfriend. That pig! All I wanted was to eat in a nice restaurant. How come my life always sucks? And on my birthday, too. Tonight's your birthday? Yes. How old are you? Twenty five. You're an old maid! Ow! I'm just kidding! Relax. Since it's your birthday... how about I give you a present? So you'll stop crying and stay pretty for me? Wait. Don't go anywhere... How come you can cook egg crust? My dad was the chef specialist when it came to egg crust. As a street vendor. Then why do you work as a waiter? Why don't you sell egg crust instead? - There's no money in egg crust. Right? - Yeah. Isn't it strange? Egg crust is the staple Jakarta dish. But people eat it only on Jakarta's birthday. It's not in at the moment. That's why. - Hey? - Yeah? Why don't you start selling egg crust in Lilo? You should suggest it. How much does one plate cost? - How much? - Around 90 cents. Around 90 cents? Sell it for nine dollars a plate. They'll eat anything expensive. That's too much. I'll try asking my boss. It's a slim chance. My boss is very Westernized. He wouldn't serve anything local. It's because you call it egg crust. You should rebrand it. Like that earlier one... "spring roll". Let's find out online. The French name for egg crust. In Jakarta, anything French with "Le" or "La" sells like crazy! Then our traditional food Lemper is also from France. Le Emper! Le Emper! Lemper. Le Emper! You're silly. Happy birthday! Enjoy your "Le Egg Crust." Thank you...? Faisal. Indri... Don't just stare at it. Eat! LM SELLS LIKE CRAZY I just realized, they're side by side. Here... wherever there's a mosque, there's a church nearby. It's the country's motto. "Unity in Diversity". Yeah, right. That's why... What? Naomi, what is that place? Over there. Looks like a love hotel. Stop the car. It's different here! CHEAP VIAGRA AVAILABLE Welcome to Lone Star. How can I help? I have a reservation. - Under? - Mr. Davit. He didn't show up, right? I thought he cancelled it. But he already paid for it? I'm sorry. You are... I'm his sister. He decided not to use the room, so he gave it to me. - But... - Stop being a pest! Give me the key. Thanks! - Seventy-five bucks. - Now? Now. It's not enough. There's an ATM downstairs. I still can wait. Fine. I'll be back. Mommy! Small? Like a rabbit? You've done it before, right? It won't hurt. I promise. Don't hold back. It's almost in... This is what you asked for, right? I'm cumming! What are you staring at? I'm taking your picture... Really? Yeah. Inside here... - Yeah. - Yes. You're weird. You remind me of my ex. Your ex? Someone. She was a singer in a club... We used to do amphetamine all the time. - Do you ever try it? - Never. We got high all the time... Sometimes up to 12 pills. That's crazy. I know... but it was so much fun. Every time we got high, we would sing... And I never understand what it means "Saturday bang"... What does it mean? You got the lyrics wrong. It's you who speak bad English. Let's analyze the lyrics. "I" means "me"... "Took" means "to bring"... "My baby" means "my infant"... Why is he bringing his infant? "Baby" is slang for "sweetheart." "Baby" means "infant." You are right. But it's also a term of endearment. I see... Too sweet... They put sugar in every coffee here. Once I ordered coffee without sugar... The waitress gazed at me strangely. She thought I was a witch. For real. Naomi... What do you miss the most about New York? Smoking in our balcony... while sipping coffee. What about you? I miss... the smell of the Indian restaurant downstairs. Naomi... Who are you going with to South America? When I asked if I could come... you stayed quiet. I don't want to just be breeding stock. Yeah? Dearest friends... It's time to say goodbye. But before I leave... I will sing one final song... The night sky Is bathed with starlight The moon shines, ever so beautiful Giving me more pain I am leaving you On a journey to find myself Do not worry, do not hesitate Just give me your smile Farewell, my love Till we meet again I am leaving, but not for long In a blink of an eye I will return to you As long as you'll forever Wait for me Farewell my love Till we meet again I am leaving, but not for long In a blink of an eye I will return to you As long as you'll forever Wait for me
