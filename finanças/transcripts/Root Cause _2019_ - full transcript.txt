Subtitles auto-translated & corrected by: Naveeen There is no branch of medicine that exists where a dead organ is left in... DOCTOR IN MEDICINE ... except in dentistry, where a root canal is leftin. If a guy's got a gangrenous toe, you got to cut the toe off because it is bacterial infested and it's toxic and it's gonna kill that patient. If you think that you can get away with an infected and toxic tooth and not have a systemic consequence, I think you are deluding yourself. NOVEMBER 24, 1994 This is the day, my whole life went to shit and I didn't even know it. This is called Schoolie's week. Every year, thousands of high school graduates spend a week getting royally wasted in the celebration to the exquisite end of their high school education. That's me. on the left. on my way to another party. -Shut up! Already said! -Excuse me! I'am sorry every time you do this! and this is the guy I was unlucky enough to get into a fight with. Hey! WoW! WoW! WoW! Are you all right? -Piss off! - Come on man, backup! I had no idea that the punch that shattered my teeth, was the punch that shattered my world. Here come those seven little words. You're going to need a root canal. Now, If you've never seen one done before, brace yourself! Because this is a root canal. They drill into your tooth... extract the root... fill it with gutter percher... and you are on your merry way. THE ROOT CAUSE Things have a funny way of catching up with you. One moment you are enjoying your holiday in Thailand then your heart starts pounding. Your breath gets shorter... your vision narrows... and you really think you're going to die. Then you find out it was just a panic attack. Well, I recommend that you start taking Lexas-M 10ml. It is an antidepressant. There could be a few side effects but there is nothing to concern yourself with. Okay? I quickly realized that the doctor is treating my chronic illness, were clutching at straws .. I read the side effects of everything they kept prescribing me: fatigue, nausea, dizziness, agitation, weight gain... and impotence. When I said that my life went to shit, I'm really not exaggerating. Panic attacks gave way to chronic fatigue. I was a wreck, A total lost cause. Twelve hours of sleep felt like one. I get out of bed every morning thinking, "Will this ever end?" Why do I feel so tired, so run down, so anxious and so confused? But I kept following that old saying: "Grin and bear it". I'd walk like a zombie to the bathroom, staring into the mirror, just like this, and asked myself the same old question: "What is wrong with me?" But I'd still smile, because that's what we do, right? We smile. We ignore the truth that's right in front of us. We move on, we smile. "Smile, though your heart is aching Smile, when your heart is breaking We grid our teeth and we smile. I did the only thing I thought I could do. I went searching for answers. First come blood tests. Then more blood tests... "perhaps, you have hypoglycemia." Bloodtests. Then comes natural path and you find yourself taking a supplement after supplement after supplement get fedup with it,burn your $100 bills oof it's some expensive ur on. Then you tap yourself silly with some EFT or TFT. "Actually I think sleep apnea is the key!" Then you start seeing spiritual healers doing spiritual courses, get your chakras balanced from your toe to your head and why not get your aura read? Tried some reflexology, iridology, kinesiology, psychology, and you better learn about endocrinology. Have Chinese herbs. Get cupping. crazy suction! "Why not have a go at moxibustion?" Hit me with shiatsu whilst I find a new guru. Yeah, I tried an op, walked the fire walk... Did my daily affirmations and didn't forget the visualizations. Wear lot's of crystals. Hanging upside down. I tried all forms of bioresonance going round from boicom to zaito and anything using sound. Saw a Psychic in a den. helped with my Zen. That repersents ill health. get a chiropractor. Found a homeopath. get your meridians balanced. Have kahuna. I even juiced for ten days straight, from wake up to night. Yep. Nothing but juice for ten days straight! eat only organic. Increase your macrobiotics. did parasite cleanse, intestine cleanse so many liver cleanses. Over a dozen coffee enemas. I tried cold showers and graduated to icebaths. I relived past lives with hypnotic regression. Hell of a session! I went inwards with the healing codes and then the neeling codes. I screamed and punched pillows. I read a truck load of books and I even tried a weee bit of medical marijuana. I did shamanic rituals. This was actually amazing! I did retreat after retreat after retreat. That was treat. I did chromotherapy, aromatherapy, hypnotherapy. "Oh, have you tried urine therapy?" "Oh, you need shilajit." Man, I tried all sorts of shit. I tried anything New Age, self-improvement. Got blessed by gurus and joined the Oneness Movement. Got my feet grounded. And don't get me started on pyramid marketing products that I bought that were meant to cure me. I even tried kambô. "Kambô? What's that?" - you ask. well, kambo's are rare amazonian frog the shamans use their poisonous skin to purge your toxins. They burn it into your skin, you pass out and vomit for 20 minutes. You may think that I am joking, but I've got the scars to prove it. And funnily enough, these are the things I tried that actually helped. But every day, I'd still get up tired... anxious and confused. I started to think that maybe I was beyond help. What if I could tell you that 98% of women that have breast cancer... AUTHOR TO KNOW YOUR TEETH ... have root canal teeth on the same side as the offending breast cancer? What if I told you that the biggest toxic influence in the body in a chronically ill person is the root canal tooth? What if I could tell you that the leading authority in cardiovascular prevention, which is Bale & Doneen, doesn't condone root canals in your mouth because of the bacteria? All the people who come to me with chronic illness... DOCTOR IN MEDICINE the question is, how many of them have a dental etiology to the cause of the ronus? I would say almost all of them. The vast majority of chronic degenerative diseases begin... CARDIOLOGIST, TOXIC AUTHOR ... with problems in the mouth, infections and toxins, and it's only until those who're addressed, they should go into any clear positive response with your disease. I had a girl come in here who was early 40's very fit, very nutrition conscious, and that she came in here because she had severe horrible back pain. Infact, the first day she walked in, she had a four pronged cane, bent over, and she was on full narcotics round the clock for her chronic pain She sat down and she wanted me to do some injections on her back to help relieve the pain. I said, "I am happy to do that, but let me just dig a little bit about what could've happened to you. " She said "well, I got back pain, I went to an orthopedist. The orthopedist said he did an MRI on my back, said I had a herniated disc, did surgery on me to remove the disc. About Six weeks later, I was worse. The orthopedist surgeon did another MRI on me, he said the disc had moved more and that I would need to have laminectomy at two levels. He took me in, did a laminectomy of the L4 and L5 vertebrae." Laminectomy means the back half of the bones and the spine are pulled off so that there's more room for the discs and more room for the nerves. At which point, I saw her, and she was worse. And what came up on the examination I did that she had some inflammation in her jaw bone. I said, "Did you have any dental work done prior to this back pain?" She said: "Come to think of it, that I did. I had an infected tooth. I had a root canal done. The root canal failed. I had another redo of the root canal. It also failed. I had the root canal tooth pulled, I had a graft put in there, and I had an implant put in there." So I said, "Let's do an experiment in the office I can inject a local anesthetic on that tooth. If your back pain is related to that tooth and I blocked the nerve coming from that tooth, it may make your back pain feel better. That may be the reason for your pain because after two failed surgeries, the chances of them working are not good. " So she said, "I'm in." I took a local anesthetic and injected to her tooth and I waited about 15 minutes. When I came back into the room, she was standing up, going like this. I said, "How does it feel?" She said, "It feels 90% gone." I said, "then probably this is linked with the tooth. I just wanted to be sure. you come back in three days, we will do this again Just want to make sure it's not just a relief reaction sort of a mental... you know the psychosomatic is gone. " We did it again she said, "It is gone. I'm going back to the oral surgeon and have them take that damn implant out. " Within a couple of weeks, her back pain, except for what was left of the surgical trauma, it was gone. Root canal procedure is still a very very popular thing in the dentistry because no one wants to lose a tooth. But more and more people beginning to realize... DOCTOR IN ORAL SURGERY ... that even for current day modern and very traditional literature, that it is impossible to sterilize the root canal system. most conventional dentists believe... that there is no problem with, but I personally couldn't disagree more. I think they are a hidden source of toxicity for almost anyone. The reason that root canals have an inherent problem... DENTIST SURGEON ... is that because we know that nowhere else in the body can we leave dead tissue Anywhere else in the body, like the appendix, have dead tissue, that does'nt heal. and any other area of the body, we know we have to remove that because it's a haven for bacteria, and it's not compatible with health. The same is true in a tooth. Tooth is a living structure, has a blood supply, has a nerve supply. And so, when a tooth dies or becomes infected, and we decide to go and do a root canal, even the best endodontist, A root canal specialist can do an great job at cleaning of the main canal of any of the teeth. But what they can't get to are all of these thousands of tubules. you can see if you cut a tooth in half or under a microscope, you can see these thousands of tubules that run out in every different directions and all sorts of angles from the main canal. those microtubules are big enough for bacteria to fit in... BODY CODE AUTHOR ...but not much else. The problem is that if we have 9km to 12km of microtubules in a single tooth, it is impossible to sterilize them. So, after root canal has been performed, unfortunately, the bacteria still reside within the tooth and now you have a nice warm incubated tooth for the bacteria to flourish. And, now there is no access from the patient's own immune system to that tooth because in the process of doing the root canal blood supply and the nerve supply have been severed and the body can no longer send its own immune defenses to help keep the infection in check. From 70% to 90%... AUTHOR AND EDUCATOR ... of all medical problems actually originated in the mouth. Conventional dentistry still hasn't focused on a mechanistic Newtonian mentality that the teeth are not connected to the rest of the body. I mean, embryologically, the teeth develop from the same tissues that gives rise to the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. The blood supply and the mouth will literally take any toxins via the lymphatic system and take it down to the thyroid, thymus, heart and for the rest of the body. So there is a direct connection. The teeth is not just like a stone... MEDICAL DIRECTOR, SENIOR CONSULTANT OF PARACELSUS ...in the mouth. It is widely connected. The pulp is extremely densely connected to the lymphatic system, to the autonomic nervous system, more than any other organs. It is connected to the oropharynx, the sensitive nerves that the brain directly enters, and all meridian systems. Every tooth connects energetically through the meridian system to certain organs and glands. For example, on the upper side of the jaw, the last two molars and this bicuspid actually connect energetically to the left breast and on this side to the right breast. And 95% of the time, women who have breast cancer and have undergone a thermographic study will be found to have hot spots in the jaw on the same side as the malignant breast. 97% of our breast cancer patients aged between 30 to 70, we tested all these patients, they had a root canal or a toxic situation in the teeth. The discussion of the energetic relationship of the teeth to the rest of the body is very interesting. Every tooth lies on a specific acupuncture meridian... BIOLOGICAL DENTISTRY ... related to certain organs and tissues and groups of vertebrae and muscles and so very often we can see a direct relationship. For instance, There's a 19-year-old girl. In her first year of college, she had a root canal on a front tooth. That front tooth relates to the kidneys and the bladder. She started to have bladder infections and kidney infections She tried every treatment known, and she was constantly going on antibiotics and nothing helped. When she came to me, I tested that root canal, I saw the direct relationship and told the mother. And it was very hard because here was 19yo girl and was a front tooth, but I said, "In this case, what really needs to be done is to remove that tooth " Well, they don't wanted to hear that so they went to try other treatments. Then about three months later, still suffering from chronic kidney problems, and urinary and bladder problems, she took the tooth out. and that was the end of the problem. I remember years ago having a physician say: "I can't buy into the concept of this electricity going through these meridians. I never seen a meridian in all the cadaver lives I've ever been in." And I said, "Well, when you can do an ECG on your cadaver, I will be able to show you a meridian because you can't find it when the person's dead." When doing an EEG, ECG or electromyography, we are looking at the electricity going through the body and this is completely mainstream. Each tooth actually lies on a different meridian so those energy pathways that we discussed, they go through particular areas. If we are looking at the wisdom teeth, we're talking about the small intestine and the heart. As we move forward, on the top, we find these molars, then we're looking at breast and thyroid. On this side we're looking at the pancreas On this side we're looking at the spleen. Then we move forward to the bicuspids, and there are lung and the large intestine. We goto the eye teeth and... It's called an eyetooth for a reason, because it's connected to your eyes, as well connected to the liver and to the gallbladder. And then these four front teeth, the top and bottom are connected to the urinary tract to the anal canal, to the adrenals, the pituitary, to your kidney and everything that's related to the urinary tract. I use a piece of equipment that was originally called EAV - electroacupuncture according to Voll. I put electricity into the body and gather data from there. So When I'm testing the teeth, the person holds a bar in their hand and that bar is the collection point. When they touch a tooth, and put it into the circuitry. and then I introduce, by touching on a particular acupuncture point, I introduce electricity into the body to see if it can go all the way through that meridian. And you start seeing where the electricity is being blocked. And now you start asking questions about the person's health and they go, "Wow! How did you know that? I didn't even tell you that I was having problems there." because when the electricity can't get through, that compromises that meridian. Many people have trouble getting their mind around the fact that their teeth are making them sick. Let me just tell you so, about a year ago... DOCTOR IN MEDICINE, HOMEOPATHY ... we looked at the last 60 cancer patients that we'd seen and 96% of them had an infected tooth in the same power supply circuit as their primary cancer. 96%! You know this might sound really fun to you but but I always wanted to learn how to surf. The sun, the spray... and that feeling of conquering a force beyond your control. Maybe that is symbolic. because after all my trials and tribulations, I still felt I just drawn a bad lottery number You know you're sick when, you can miraculously, attract a gorgeous girl. your'e punching way above your way and... you can't get it up. I know every guy will say this, but... "It hasn't happened before." Surprised to say, she left pretty soon after. How is this journey going to end? Would I reach the top of the mountain, conquering everything that came before me? Would it be the death of me? I obsessed over these questions and everything else. Even friends and family they became less important. "What's wrong with me? You are so hypochondriac.! "Why are you so lonely?" "Toughen up yourself and get on with it." "I think he has depression." "Why is he so anxious?" "It's all in his head." I felt truely empty inside. No body who has an abscess in the body would suggest ignoring it. The same with a dental abscess. The problem is that they are frequently asymptomatic. Most people who come to see me and who have root canals turn out to be infected, but theren't coming with a sore tooth Nobody comes to see me with a sore tooth. They come with arthritis, fatigue, cancer, heart disease. And it turns out when I get a scan done of the root canal that there is bone being absorbed because of chronic infection to the tooth. Conventional dentistry believes that you should save the tooth at all costs, and if the patient dies... well that was the price for saving the tooth. They don't really come with the concept that you should take things that are dead out of the body. It was shocking to me because I had family members... DENTIST SURGEON who had root canal treated teeth, and I had done root canals because I was never taught to question if residual infection was having any kind of negative implication on the overall health of the patient. Probably the earliest research on root canal treated teeth that clearly demonstrated how toxic they were all of the time was the work of Dr. Weston Price. Dr. Weston Price who did a 25 years of research on root canals and found that they could cause almost anything from mental disease to heart disease to arthritis. When Weston Price started doing root canals on his patients, he found that a lot of them getting sick, so then he started doing research. He'd take out the tooth, he'd sterilize the tooth on the outside, making sure that there was nothing as far as bacteria, slipped it under the skin of a rabbit and found out that the rabbit had any disease that the patient had. Heart disease, Kidney disease, arthritis, neurological disease, you name it It even more amazingly, he took the same tooth and successively put it under the skin of 20, 30, 50 consecutive rabbits and they all developed the same medical syndrome as the original person who supplied that tooth. So, there is a direct connection between the pathogens of this dead teeth, the galvanic currents between the different metals in the mouth. For example, I had a patient with emphysema who took steroids for over a year. I found a strep infection in the jaw bone where he had a tooth removed 15 years prior. Once I got rid of the strep infection in the jaw bone his emphysema totally disappeared. The mouth is a toxic waste dump that's impacting on the rest of the body. Now, Dr. Price was a dentist, and root canals had become "posh" Originally, if you were poor person and if you couldn't afford dentistry, then, your teeth would be taken out. When someone had money and went to the dentist, and said: "You know I've just kind of been neglecting or forgotten and I want to know if there's a way you can save my tooth because if I open and laugh, people will think I'm poor because I don't have my teeth. So, it was actually more patient driven that dentistry started taxiderming teeth to keep them in someone's mouth, and then put a nice shiny gold crown on there so that when they laughed, everybody thought they had money because you saw these gold teeth now. Unfortunately, the dental schools look at the mouth as being a mannequin, and that you can do any type of procedure without any direct impact on the rest of the body. But, this is farthest thing from the truth. Data we've just recently got shows now that the number one cause of heart attacks is the root canal treated tooth. Plain and simple. Not correlation. Not linked. Cause and effect. If you take a course through Bale & Doneen, and they're the leaders in cardiovascular prevention, they will tell you, they will not condone having a root canal in your mouth because that bacteria courses through your body and that bacteria is known to affect the cardiovascular disease. My pet peeve as a cardiologist right now is that so many family practitioners, internal medicine practitioners, cardiologists, my fellow cardiologists see a patient that has a heart attack and they find the cholesterol is ok, lipids are ok, there is no high blood pressure, there's no risk factors and they might've used these words with the patients but they gonna tell you they think: "That patient just had bad luck" Most of these things are not genetic problems. You know? This person in the first 25 or 50 years of life was ok! Now they're not. This isn't your genes. This is your body's toxic, and if we can restore those things, your can get your health back and energy back and you can have a fun life. As I like to illustrate my speech, So we gonna use this scenario: I'm driving my car down the road and I see that my oil light has come up. I could get a hammer and smash the oil light. That would take care of the problem, wouldn't it? No, it wouldn't. Because this is a sign, a symptom that something is going on. What I like to do is look deeper down and find the particular burden or the root cause And no pun intended because most of the time it's a tooth problem. And then the sun rose another day. I walk to the bathroom as usual, I ask myself that same question: "What is wrong with me?" And as usual, I was on my way to yet another test. Another healing modality. Using a device called the Lecher antenna, information from your blood is tested against the variety of things that can make people sick, and the antenna swings, if the answer is yes. Is it emotional? No. Is it a parasite? No. Is it heavy metals? No. Is it dental? Yes. Is it an a mercury filling? No. Is it an infected canal? You have an infected root canal. Strange science aside, this was the first time that anyone told me that my chronic fatigue was because of a tooth. It seemed bizarre, until I really did some research. BIOLOGICAL DENTISTRY My quest started with books. The basic problem with the root canal it is what I call a fatally flawed procedure. Fatally flawed in terms of the fact that the reason of root canal is that you come to the dentist in pain. A tooth hurts. You want to get rid of the pain, naturally. The problem is in taking out the pain, the dentist takes out the nerve, the pulp, and the blood supply and connected tissue. Basically if you will the tooth undergoes a process of taxidermy while it is still in your mouth. That tooth is dead. There's no feeling in it, so there's no pain. But there is an abscess, there's an infection there that's active. and if you put probes in there and measure, you will find biotoxins that are most severest that exist in nature. The wisdom poured in from podcasts, YouTube, Skype, articles. I digested everything I heard. Root canal treated teeth can be a silent type of infection. I've taken out numerous root canal treated teeth. that looked completely fine on the X-ray, and yet after we took that tooth out and cleaned out that socket, we would find a large area of dead bone, a cyst or even pus and infection in there. Then I discovered the father of biological dentistry, Hal Huggins. If you have rupture of the appendix... VOICE OF DR. HAL HUGGINS ... will you fill it with wax and put a golden crown on it? You got the same bacteria there, only the ones in the mouth may be worse. But the question is, do all root canal teeth have to be removed? The answer is no. Only those of people who are interested in your health. But something didn't quite add up. If the root canal treated teeth were this much of a problem... why wouldn't more people know about it? WHY DENTISTS DON'T KNOW... Above 95% of dentists have an X-ray equipment in their office which is only two-dimensional, which means when they take the x-ray from here, they can only see the width and height on the tooth. They can't see depth and you might take a picture of a root canal tooth and it looks fine. But if you do another kind of X-ray, it's called a cone beam scan, which is almost like a CATscan, where you get a three-dimensional view of the tooth we very commonly find that these root canal teeth are abscessed and there's an abscess sitting around the tooth that isn't visible on a 2D X-ray. During our training, I had a patient on whom I had taken a Conebeam on and She was struggling with some emotional problems, chronic fatigue and a lot of other things. We were reviewing her conebeam with a technician, not a biological dentist. This is a technician from the company. I said, "Let's just goto each one of the root canal treated teeth and flip this image and see if we see any pathology." And so as were flipping through he said: "Wow! These are terrible. there is a cyst here and another cyst here. " I see root canals all the time that look great on X-ray, but they do not test well They're a real problem for the individual. Every root canal tooth contains dead tissue and dead tissue is haven for bacteria. We analyzed 87 very well done root canal treated teeth many of them done by endodontists and many more done by general dentists. What we found that regardless of how well the root canal was performed, by far the vast majority had a high degree of toxicity. There was not one of the 87 were non-toxic. The toxins are often the waste material from the bacteria. They can be also portions for example, like the bacterial cell wall, but often times they're the waste material of bacteria. One of the world's leading authorities on biological toxins it's Boyd Haley, from Univ. of Kentucky. What Dr. Haley found and published is that toxins from a root canal tooth are equal in toxicity to the standard by which all biological toxins are measured, mainly hydrogen sulfide. He also found that toxins from a root canal tooth are equivalent in toxicity to botulism, one of the worst known poisonings. All root canals are infected, without any exception. There was a big study done by the American Society of Holistic Dentistry. Very officially they tested 30,000 root canals extracted for years and they were all infected without any exception. There used to be a laboratory at University of Kentucky called Affinity Labeling Technologies. It was a laboratory from Dr. Boyd Haley who is the chairman of the department of chemistry there. He setup a lab test where you could stick a cotton sort of a hard cotton thing under the tooth that you suspected as being bad and shoved it underneath the gum, pulled it out, and you'd have a sample of the fluid those samples would go to the lab and what they would do is a bioessay, defined what is the toxic material coming from the root of the tooth. This lab doesn't exist anymore, but I have an old report from a patient this was the patient with chronic fatigue. He came to me and when I examined him, I thought, "I think your problem is a toxic root canal tooth. Go to the dentist, have this test done. " He went ahead and had test done. and these are the results. The test now, what the test looks at is these are six enzymes which are part of what we call the Krebs cycle. These are the energy producing part of the cell. these enzymes are able to take up a sugar molecule and get the energy out of it. If these enzymes are blocked, then that cell cannot make energy and what biotoxins do is block these enzymes from working. So, what they did is took the stuff from the tooth the bad tooth and the good tooth, and they incubated them with these enzymes and they have a measurement system where they say how bad was that enzyme blocked. In this particular patient, the average was 93% inhibition, which is blocking of that enzyme. And by coordinating with dentists around the country, over 5,000 extracted root canal treated teeth were submitted to Dr. Haley for testing. 100% of them were toxic. And just to make sure that this was'nt something they had to do with the tooth of the mouth, they also submitted some teeth that were extracted for orthodontic purposes, in other words, normal teeth that let the other teeth grow in. None of these teeth inhibited any of these enzyme. HIGH RISK PATHOGENS That was the finally the smoking gun. That was the cause and the effect, that the root canal simply cannot be sterilized inside the mouth. It cannot be put into a situation where the infection inside the root canal can be resolved. And it's not sensed locally because the tooth when you root canal it is disconnected from the nerve so that it has and has no more sensitivity. That is why the patient can't feel the toxic effect. You can't feel the death. One of the amazing things is when people come into the office and I say, "I'm gonna tell you what's going on with you: insomnia, you have trouble with your memory, stress, you can't deal with stimulus," and I go down this list. They often start crying because Usually I'am the first physician who has described them, without them telling me, what's going on with their life. Because all the other physicians they've seen they say: "Oh, that's all in your mind. here, take these antidepressants and you will be fine. " The root canal specialists wanna protect their procedure. Ok, so they are going to try to reassure people as much as possible. I don't know what their intent is, I don't mean to say they are not interested for the health and wealth of their patients. But, they truly believe that the root canal procedure is fine, it does a good job, and they don't believe that it’s chronically infected. But the scientific evidence takes this out of belief range. ok Belief has nothing to do with it Science shows that a root canal is always infected and the only difference is some are a little bit more toxic and are more infected than the others. When I was a boy, I used to run to his office. The guys like to kid me. "Running to the dentist?" But he was an some dentist. His name was Dr. Brann. He always let me come five minutes early so I can see his lab. He let me touch things and told me about them. I used to get so excited. He would pat my head and say, "Fine Fine.." Only he never told me how hard it was to become one! When I was older I learned, He went to college for eight years, and had to study dozens of subjects, not just dentistal ones, but physiology and anatomy and bacteriology. PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY OUR FRIEND, THE DENTIST THE VALUE OF A SMILE I found that in the America, about 25 million new root canal procedures are done each year. While this did alarm me what it really made me wonder was: "Why me?" Why didn't all these people have root canal problems like I did? So often times I am asked: "Why does a root canal have a systemic health impact on one person and maybe not on another? The reason is: we are all susceptible to toxicities in different ranges. As you know, there are some people can tolerate cigaratte smoking for example 60 or 70 years and have no apparent ill affects and yet, there are people who smoke for a year or two and develop a carcinoma. Every one processes toxins differently and some patients are able to handle a root canal treated tooth and their immune system isn't overloaded by that. Yet there are other patients we find who just one root canal has the dramatic affect on their immune system The practice that I have is a very selected practice. Most of the people I see have chronic serious illnesses. Probably in the general population, these aren't diagnosed because the guy who's seeing the patient for high blood pressure, for chronic back pain, is not associating it and he's not testing could this be a dental issue that's referred. It is very important that dentistry and medicine get together. It is important that physicians are as aware of the importance of the mouth as it is for dentists to realise that some of the procedures that he/she does in the mouth severely and strongly and impacts the health of the body. A perfect example: we have a patient was referred to us was stage four throat cancer .. The bottom line was, he had two root canal teeth. X-rays looked pristine. and a thousand of dentists who had viewed them would say these are absolutely normal. The pathogens that were in these two root canal teeth were in his throat, exactly where the cancer was. I extracted the two teeth and ozonated the jawbone, homeopathics and ionic silver. In three weeks, the stage four throat cancer was totally resolved, documented with PETscans, blood test and visual. This is the impact of a toxic root canal teeth. There was one relation study between diseases and root canals, published in a very perstigeous oncology news paper in the United States, which showed that 90% of all the prostate cancers contained it's tissue the carcenogenic bacteria which come from the root canal. I felt bad because I had done a lot of those. and I actually thought at one point that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I thought, "How can this be?" This is something that has been going on for so long. There is a whole speciality around it But whenever colleagues started presenting me different pieces of research, I obviously came to the conclusion I didn't wanted to do root canal treatment anymore personally. I could not confidently say that I was not doing harm in some situations. The bottom line is, when you do a root canal, it cuts the flow of energy to these different organs and can affect them. You can't get rid of an infection unless you have a viable immune system with complete access to all the parts that are infected and this is uniformly eliminated when a root canal is done. The analogy that I like to use: in my office there's a sliding door. You are on one side of the door with the door closed. You have christmas lights in your hand you want to know if all the lights light up. I'm on the other side of the sliding door and I have an extension cord plugged in, ready to go, but you and I are hitting the door We can't connect. There's no way. If someone comes by and starts sanding on the door, how much of the door has to be gone before you and I can connect? Not a thin piece of balsa wood. All of it. Once all of the door is removed, you and I are able to make a connection. Just like the body does. It totally reconnects and electricity goes through. After everything that I uncovered, I knew my teeth had to come out. I saw a biological dentist and the first thing he spotted was: "Looks like you have a trauma to your front tooth?" Yep. That punch in the mouth why was I such a sucker for that damsel in distress? Let's have a look at the X-ray here. And all this discoloration here is where the infection is. It is a deep pocket infection on top that's what is causing your health issues. So, were gonna extract the root canal tooth and with the dental barb drill we gonna remove the periodontal ligament down to the bone and we will give you a new tooth, a zirconia tooth that will bridge to the either side. In the next three four months, this will heal up nicely and you will notice a dramatic increase in your energy levels. -Yes. -Any question? No. Alright. Let's do this. Now, I don't want you to think as soon as you get your tooth out, you will wake up with boundless energy. The damage has been done. You have to heal yourself and go through a detox: liver cleanse, kidney cleanse, colon cleanse Intense journey. But, gradually you start to feel your health returning. Now It's important obviously if you have a root canal, and you're convinced of the information I'm talking about and the science behind it you want to get it out of your body, you want it to have it stop negatively impacting your health. Well, you need to find a dentist who knows what he's doing because it involves more than a simple extraction. Removing the root canal tooth is only the first step in the solution. afterwards, you have to drain the area from the bacteria because the jaw bones, they're are not like stones. They are spongy bones where bacteria and toxins go into these bones this has to be drained and treated. And, this is where I also find ozone gas so indispensable Because, you can just punch with a very thin needle go into the area and you inject ozone gas. That gas will go off into all areas off this main tunnel, in all the areas we have infection. It's really interesting because I had a people where I've injected down here and they've feel the gas travel all the way over to the other side, and they've feel it travel all way up under the the eye. There's no way you are going to do a surgery & cleanup a whole persons jawbone. And it's interesting how this treatment goes on with the gas they feel that that area were it's going off into shrinking This jaw bone area has a very dense nerve network. These nerves don't relay. You know It is not like here goes to the spinal cord, and goes to somewhere else. These nerves go right to the middle of the brain where the regulation of the nervous system occurs. They are called cranial nerves. These cranial nerve is the biggest one in the body and it goes right into there. This is a very delicate and protected area. So if someone has a chronic smouldering infection with biotoxin in this area, it can affect their brain, the regulation of brain, the energy and lots of other things. For example, we had a woman with Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune problem, which is coming in a cytomegalovirus from the third molar extraction site in a jawbone, plus nickel ions from an orthodontic retaining wire. Once those two substances were removed from the thyroid and the sources, the Hashimoto's totally disappeared. Autoimmune problems are there for a reason. The body does'nt attack itself for no reason. There is something there that is causing that reaction. The doctor has to be alert to discuss If he wants a cure, especially with cancer, you got to address these. They are big stressors on the body and they take a lot of immune attention. If the immune system's like: "Don't let toxins get into the brain and kill me," it is letting the cancer cells go here or in the prostate or in the colon. You know, the big ones. Or in the lungs. These are the four big cancers. Your chances of getting cancer is significantly increased and this is just spreading out of the ignorance of the so-called specialists who dont want to accept this fact, even though it is absolutely clearly proven. So, in doing testing of the bacteria we found that there are in root canals, 53 different bacteria. 28 of them are directly involved with the health of the heart, that are known from the scientific literature to create certain heart conditions. Some of them specialize in attacking the heart valve. Many of them cause what's called endocarditis, an inflammation of the vessels inside the heart. And we now have studies from the Journal of the American Dental Association that show that when you have one or more root canals in your mouth, statistically speaking, you have a greater chance of a heart attack, plain and simple. We know with increasing evidence that the cause of coronary artery disease it is the inflammation of the endothelium, the lining of the blood vessel valve. What we need to do in medicine is workout what is inflaming the valve or the artery because ultimately what the body is the body tries to seal off the inflammation the body uses cholesterol it uses calcium to seal off that inflammation You're getting what's called a plaque, the same plaques you get on your teeth, which is, a bacteria covered by a biofilm, then covered by a layer of calcium. This is that exactly what we're seeing in the coronary arteries. The trick is not to try to get rid of cholesterol, which is going there, that has been put there by the body, to protect us against the inflammation. The trick is to try and work out what is the causing the underlying inflammation. A dental infection is a big part of that because of the sealing of the bacteria from the mouth straight into the bloodstream there to the coronary arteries. This is the process that can occur to a person, and it can be undone, if observed by a doctor who knows what they're doing. We do a test for all these organic toxins where we can see if the body, so to say, impregnated by these toxins which come from root canal. We can measure these toxins, called xenoharmones, carcinogenic substances which are organic molecules Once we have the basic toxic source removed from the patient, then things like infrared sauna is good. You will sweat. There's nutritional agents that we can give you then we can tease these things out of you and get them out. Then our basic program is we find out what nutrients they're missing and we give'em back to them. Some of it's oral supplements, some of it's done intravenously we do I V vitamin C. We use pulsed magnetic field because there are cells that do'nt make energy. Those cells don't have energy and their membrane around the cell can't control very well what goes in and out. If we put them in an environment, where there's a gentle magnetic pulse field, it recharges that cell membrane, and now that cell can detoxify itself. In over three to six months, sometimes a bit little longer, we can get these things out, we can get your levels down to where they're safer and then it can help you restore your health. I was starting to feel great so I went to the EAV machine operator to make sure my energy flow was on track. But something was off. I found out I had another blockage. This time, in one of my wisdom teeth. I dug deeper and got a Conebeam scan. I was told it was a cavitation, something else you really dont want. Just my luck! I had to get that sorted out now as well Step 1 was finding out what a cavitation is. Cavitations are basically residual infections in the jawbone, which result from the extraction of a teeth. If the extraction site is not meticulously curated and cleansed, the bacteria just infiltrate into that wound and live there for the rest of the life of the patient. Every bone in your body is connected to another bone by way of a ligament. Your tooth is connected to your jawbone by way of what we call a periodontal ligament. If a tooth is properly pulled when the tooth is out, the dentist will also take out that ligament. If that ligament is gone, that bone will heal in so that there's full bone and you have a restored jaw bone But if the doctor pulls that tooth and doesn't take out that ligament, that space where that tooth was may seal over on the top and be a cavity. That periodontal ligament staying in the socket, it prevents communication from the body being able to send osteoblasts and osteoclasts to that extraction site and fill in with healthy bone. It becomes a barrier. And it will be a place where that the body then will use as a storage depo for junk - toxic junk, bacteria, funguses - and it won't hurt. It may not be completely visible on a regular X-ray, but it's sitting there. So the periodontal ligament prevents healing. In one actual study on 5,000 cavitations left after wisdom teeth were removed, 4,999 had not healed. Only one of the 5,000 had healed. Majority of people in the United States and in developed countries around the world that have extracted teeth for any reason also have cavitations and what's inside that hole is noting different - and it sounds disgusting and it sounds like an exaggeration but it’s not - it's the same as wet infectious gangrene. These cavitations in the jawbone can create significant diseases, significant neurological diseases, like for example, sclerosis. But that cavitation can occur from different things. For instance a person can have a clotting disease or they could have had a football injury something that the bone not be healthy in a particular area. The most common reason is that the tooth was removed and the periodontal ligament was not taken out, and therefore, that void where the tooth was never did fillin appropriate with a healthy bone. The second most common reason is that the bacteria that's in a root canal tooth will find a microfracture through that particular root surface and kind of worm hole through the bone and create a void and so, it's not uncommon for a cavitation to occur next to a root canal. The most common spots are the wisdom teeth. The wisdom teeth are unique in that there are four circuits going through instead of just two - it's heart, small intestine and the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. And so you see people who's adrenal glands aren't working and it's because they have infection where the wisdom teeth were taken out. Because you can have infections in the bone where wisdom teeth were taken off for 50 years, and essentially have no pain there, but it completely destroys your life. When you don't have enough adrenaline, you have trouble going to sleep. and then you have trouble dealing with stress. Then it gets to where you can't stand any stimulus so you don't like loud music, you don't like loud noises, you can't be around a rowdy crowd, you can't be around people who're arguing. Now what I just described is a person who's lives in a toilet. For instance, I myself had my wisdom teeth out when I was in dental school. But, thirty years later, I developed a heart arrhythmia and nothing seemed to help, I take vitamins in, I tried homeopathics, but nothing was doing help. Then, suddenly, I said: "Wait a minute, let me check see if I have any cavitation?" That wisdom tooth, which is on the heart meridian, you see was causing problem. If you can get a good normal 3D conebeam x-ray of your jawbone, then you do have a much higher reassurance that you don't have this cavitation process going on inside the jawbone as well. And, if the dentist unroofs that and scoops the stuff out, and then removes that ligament and then that heals, that patient can get well. One of the questions that we get is: "Are there things that I can do prior to my procedure to increase my ability to heal properly from a surgical procedure like a cavitation or from a root canal removal." One of the biggest things that you can do is to have an proper nutrition, eating a clean diet, getting enough proteins and vitamins and minerals. When that tooth comes out, you want to make sure that the socket is cleaned out really well. You want to remove the periodontal ligament. If there is an infection, you want to get rid of the infection, and then you let it heal. I like to let the body to fill it in with it's own natural bone. You have to wait least three months for that. You want to check it and make sure that it did heal, that you don't have no cavitation. Let's say it's healed. How do you replace the tooth? Well, you have different options. First one option is you don't replace it, you leave it alone. Another option is you can use something removable, which most people do'nt like it because it's not very comfortable. The other option is you could put a bridge in, bridging that space. There are two types of bridges. The traditional bridge, which I don't like, is where you have to mutilate the teeth on either side of that space to hold the missing tooth. And the problem with that is, when you mutilate those teeth, you increase the odds of those teeth can need root canal in the future. So I prefer to use a bonded type bridge, where the abutment teeth, as they are called, or the supporting teeth have minimal preparation and that holds the missing tooth. The only downside with that really is that it periodically will come loose and need to be recemented. But, of course, the best option is to take really good care of your teeth and gums with a comprehensive dental program so you never need a root canal, but let's say that hasn't happened like me and a lot of other people I know, let's say there was a trauma involved and you didn't get an option. You can't really walk around with no front teeth. It is not very good for business. Am I gonna have some sort of bridge? Am I gonna have some sort of implant? An implant is where you're going into the bone and you're placing what traditionally has been a titanium implant. Today, we have also ceramic implants. The advantages and disadvantages, well, with titanium, the problem is that you are putting a metal into the bone. Titanium itself is known as a hapten. It means the ions in the titanium itself can trigger autoimmune. If you are genetically predisposed to something like Hashimoto's thyroiditis, celiac, scleroderma, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis, it might get turned on and even if the implant is removed, the trigger is already been pulled. so now you got problems that you didn't have. Plus, I got metal that is directly going into my meridian system. It's like sticking a spoon in an electric socket and bending it around and sticking it into the bottom part. and it shortens out the whole meridian. What we are finding is that many physicans that are refering their patients here and also patients that are doing their own research are desiring to have no metal in their mouth. They want to eliminate anything that could create a current. And that's why we now have zirconia implants it's more like a ceramic It's a complete non-metal implant, that looks the same as a titanium implant but functions the same but it's considered much more biocompatible for the tissue and for the patient. And it interferes with the body much much less than titanium implants. I do not say that zirconia implants are 100% good, but they are much better tolerable to the body than titanium implants are. So, good medicine would include this and that is what we want to do. We want the best medicine. We want to give people things that don't hurt them more than they help them. root canals are probably one of the most pernicious, toxic, hidden influences on your health and if you're struggling to understand why you're so sick and you have multiple root canals, please examine that issue. I don't want you to think I have my head in the clouds by saying that the only reason I got chronic fatigue was because I had a root canal. My searchs led me to believe that all chronic diseases are because of toxic overload. These toxins come in various forms from a simplest toxic junk food to environmental toxins to toxic emotions. We are all now learning about the toxic effects of electromagnetic frequencies as well and we also can't rule out pathogens. What I can say is that until I stop the soure of my toxic root canal, by having it removed, I could never get better, no matter what I tried. It really was the biggest piece of the jigsaw puzzle. The root cause, so to speak. So, your dentist says that you need a root canal. Apart from running for the door, what are your options? Firstly, if the tooth needs to be removed, make sure you see a holistic dentist, while you can remove the infection and the periodontal ligament properly. Then once the tooth is removed and the mouth has healed, you have three good options. Your first option is to get a bonded ceramic bridge. Your second option is to get a zirconia implant. And, 99% of dentists will recommend a titanium implant, but it’s just as bad as the root canal. So make sure your implant is zirconia. Your third option is a good old fashioned denture. Keep smiling! I've been reading this book about Gandhi. He didn't have a lot of tooth problems like me. rumor was, he had dentures that he slipped in and out every night. But his words were as beautiful as his smile. He said that even if only you are in minority of 1, the truth is still the truth. Probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% or 90% of people are sick atleast in part if not totally by an infected tooth. This couldn't be a miracle for a patient. It could be a life saving on a patient. I've got tons of patients where this was really their problem and when we addressed this, then they were actually able to get better. My mentor. Dr. Hal Huggins, told me 20 years ago: "You can't dry off while you're still in the shower." It is a simple but profound statement. You can't resolve a problem if what causes the problem is continuing to shower in while you're trying to resolve the situation. In today's medicine and dentistry we have two important things being done to our body, but neither field interacts with other. If doctors did more of this, we could actually help a lot more people, get a lot more people better and do what our profession is supposed to do: which is help the people heal up. 1 in 2 of us are dying of heart disease One in two of us are dying of cancer. We better have a strategy for both. Make sure you take really good care of your oral hygiene. and have a program in place to make sure you minimize the amount of pathogenic organisms in our mouths, leaking into our bloodstream. There is another great quote: "A new knowledge is never immediately adopted rather the old knowledge dies out and the new takes it's place. " So, to each of you who hear this, know that the challenge of whether this truth reaches the world is upto you. Currently, we have roughly 25 million new root canal procedures being done a year in the United States. One of the greatest public health interventions that we could possibly do around the world is to make it very clear the important role that dental infections and toxins have and hopefully someday to make the root canal procedures something of the past because it does nothing positive for the general health of the body at all. I'm just one guy and this is my truth. This truth set me free. I feel that freedom every day when I wake up. It is in my joy, my sorrow my friendships. Oh, and in case you wonder if I can get it up... There's no problem there. I got my life back... so I didn't want my truth to just be a minority of one. I'm a filmmaker and the journey I had been on was epic! So maybe it was meant to happen to me afterall Subtitles auto-translated & corrected by: Naveeen
