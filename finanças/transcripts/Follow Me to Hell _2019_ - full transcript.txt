Okay, kids. Our field trip for today is over. What you need to do is make a short story about our activities today. Okay? - Yes, Ma'am! - Yes, Ma'am! Where is Litasari? - Litasari? - Litasari? I'm so happy to be in this field trip. We're able to learn while sightseeing. It gets boring in class. We only read books. It's fun here. We can learn about machines in the factory. We learn about farming. We can play too. So, we can play while we learn. Lita, who are you talking to? There's nobody beside you. Are you talking to yourself? Right. Lita often talks to herself in class. I've seen it. Lita is like a crazy person who talks to herself. Or maybe Lita is talking to the dwellers here. Help! Is that the wind? Let's go! Be careful, kids. Hop on the bus. "School Bus" "Ikut Aku Ke Neraka" What's wrong? Every night, she feels like she is being haunted by a vicious ghost. The ghost doesn't just haunt her, but hurts and tortures her as well. Do you believe that? I saw some wounds and bruises on her body, but I'm sure she did it to herself. Is that your instinct talking or your logic? I don't believe in ghosts. It's not within our field either. But... ...seeing her from here... ...and observing her gestures... ...her expressions... ...I sense a bleak aura. And dark, too. Maybe this has something to do with the other realm? A realm that I don't understand. I'm afraid this is no longer our territory. Break is over in five minutes! - Miss. - Sir. - Where is she? - She is upstairs, Sir. - Can you please get my bag from the car? - Yes, Sir. Honey. Doctor Paul will be coming back from Singapore tomorrow. So, you can finally get rid of your birthmark. This is the last stage, right? Do you think it's safe to get lasered when I'm this late on my pregnancy? He said it's fine, but it's up to you. I never forced you to get rid of your birthmark. I love you just the way you are. Yeah, but it's also to save you from embarrassment, right? When you're out with me? Honey, shouldn't we just save the money for our princess? Anyway, you're fine with my birthmark, right? I have planned everything out for her. Besides, after marrying you, and now that you're pregnant, my career has been going very well. Amen! I just want to give the woman I love what she deserves, to make you happy... ...and for me to keep admiring your beauty. Sexy. Alluring. Why are you discussing this right now? Well... We're discussing it now... ...and doing it tonight. Why do you look so tense? Don't worry. Everything is going to be alright. I'm just nervous. It's our first child. Anyone can be nervous when they experience something for the first time. You already sound like a mother. I will be a mother soon. What's wrong? I saw a scary woman through the mirror. When I checked... ...she wasn't there anymore. Maybe you're just hungry. People tend to lose focus when they are hungry. Let's have dinner. I'm sure our little one is also hungry. You go ahead. I'll be right there. Alright. I was wrong. Forgive me. Forgive me. Ma'am? Why are you still awake? Get some rest. Get some rest. Okay? It's time for the final touch. I'm going into labor soon, Doctor. Is it alright? It's alright. I'll give you a shot that is safe for your baby. It's not even categorized as a surgery. It's just a small procedure. Honey, convince yourself that it's okay. Dr. Paul is the best in this field. Shall we? It looks very smooth. Thank you, Honey. Ironically, I still don't know why I have that scar on my back. My mother never told me why. She hid a lot of things. She kept thousand of secrets until I finally decided to leave her. I've been a bad daughter. So ungrateful to my parents. You aren't leaving her forever. I'm sure... ...one day you will meet her again. It's just a matter of time. Thank you, Honey... ...for marrying me. Don't say that. It's not you who got lucky marrying me and be by my side. I'm the one who is blessed to have you in my life. And our little one. Hello, yes, Sir? Right. Yes, I'm about to leave. Yes, I have prepared everything, Sir. Yes, thank you. Yes. Hang in there, Sweetie. You'll be born soon. Honey, what's wrong? Come here. My reflection changed. It turned into that woman I saw yesterday and she attacked me. As if... ...she's mad at me. Did you punch the mirror? Rama, I'm serious. Alright, I'll have someone fix it tomorrow. I have an early day at the factory tomorrow. So I have to sleep early. Sweet child Don't you cry Mother is always - Miss? - With you Sweet child Don't you cry Mother is always with you Rama! Ram! Rama! Lit? Lita, what happened? She's there... What is it? The woman that I told you. She's very scary, Rama. She was about to grab me. I don't see anything, Lita. She's there, Rama. She's there! What wrong, Sir? There's nothing, Lita. What happened, Ma'am? I swear... I swear she was there. She was right there. Alright, calm down. Whatever you saw was not real. Are you saying I'm lying? No, Honey, I believe you, but maybe it's just... Her water broke! Let's take her to the hospital. - Help me. - Yes, Sir. It hurts, Ram. Hang in there, Honey. How are you, Ma'am? Are you ready to be called 'mom'? Hurry up, Doctor! I'm not joking! Calm down, Ma'am. This will hurt a little bit. Try to relax. - You can do it. - It won't be long now. - Nurse, please assist. - Yes, Doc. - You can do it, Ma'am. - Yes, you can do it. - Let's push. - Right. Push. That's it. Now breathe in. Good. A little bit more. - She's right there, Ram. - You can do it. Regulate your breathing, Ma'am. Focus, Honey. Focus. Another push. - She's there! - Ma'am. - Focus. You need to focus. - Regulate your breathing, Ma'am. Just a little bit more. Push. That's it. Keep pushing. She's there! She's there! One more push. Yes! Congratulations, Sir. You have a healthy baby girl. Is my wife alright? She'll be fine. She'll wake up in about half an hour. It's normal. Excuse me. Ma'am, do you like staying here? Mrs. Sari... ...who do you talk to... ...every night? My daughter. You have a daughter? She visits me often. Before you came here... ...you lived alone, didn't you? I have never seen your daughter. I'm sorry, Ma'am. Hi, Miss. Sir. Such a beautiful baby! Thank you. You're welcome. Miss, can you please get our stuff from the car? Yes, Sir. Honey, your phone. Maybe she's hungry? I've been feeding her. Maybe she's just wants attention. You don't want your father to go to work, do you? I want the same thing, Putri. But if I don't go to work... ...I won't be able to raise you. Why are you giving her so much pressure? Sorry. While you were at the hospital, I have set this all up. So when Putri cries, you will be able to hear her. Rama. I'm still scared. What happened before my water broke was real. Even when I was giving birth, that woman was there. Honey, it's not that I don't believe you. - But maybe you're just... - What? Hallucinating? Delusional? Ram... ...I'm not insane. I saw it with my own eyes, it's real. Honey, relax. I have to go to work, all my employees are waiting for me. Let's hope I can get off work early, so I can be with you. Alright, take care. Don't come home too late. Yes, I promise. I'll try to get off early. Alright? Putri. Daddy has to go to work. Bye. Bye, Honey. Doctor! Dr. Shinta! What's wrong? Doctor, Mrs. Sari told me that her daughter visits her often. - Her daughter? - Yes. But she doesn't have any relatives. According to data, yes, but... Maybe it's all in her head. Usually, people who are depressed tend to imagine things. So she thinks that her daughter often comes to visit her. That might be true. Miss? Yes, Ma'am? Have you checked on Putri? Yes, she's asleep. Alright, I'm going to lie down for a minute. Okay. Miss? Miss? Oh, Sweetie. Putri, Dear. This is mommy. I know. Putri, don't cry. Sweetie. Mommy's here. - Yes, Honey? - Ram. Come home now. That woman is here again. Calm down, I'm on my way. Hurry up, Rama! Putri! Go away! Leave me alone! Go away! Lita? Lit? Ma'am? Honey? Honey, calm down, I'm here. Sorry for coming home late. I'm sorry, Ma'am. I was taking out the trash. I was haunted by a baby ghost. She disguised herself as Putri. And that woman was here again. She's really scary, Rama. What's that for? This is believed to keep spirits out of our house. So you can feel more calm and relaxed. I don't want to sleep here anymore. I'm trying to find a solution, Lita. The solution is to get out from this house. Ram, if you experienced what I went through last night... ...would you be brave enough? You would have been scared. Honey, you gave birth a few days ago. You're exhausted. You're not in the right state of mind. It's probably just baby blues? I'm sorry, Sir. Maybe she has a point. If you need a psychic, I know someone. No need. Just hang this on the back door, okay? Yes, Sir. Miss Inah? - Miss... - Yes? Tell the psychic to come tomorrow morning. Alright? Yes, Sir. Mrs. Sari? Mrs. Sari? Mrs. Sari? Nurse! Let's take her to the medical room! Sir. Mr. Adam? I asked Miss Inah to invite Mr. Adam to our home. He is a master in traditional healing. He is also a psychic who understand supernatural world, Ma'am. Thank you for coming. We have a problem. What is the problem, Sir? What's happening? She is the khodam who is always with you. What does that mean? Khodam or qorin. Qorin? Every human has a qorin... ...or khodam. They could be good or evil. Depending on how you are as a human. I still don't understand what you mean. Why is she haunting me now? I want her gone. You've made her angry. Please explain clearly and give us a solution. Yes. I have found the answer. The reason she's angry. This poor baby... ...was born at a bad time. But... ...the baby is not the trigger. The trigger... ...is you. What changes have you made recently? I did laser surgery for my birthmark. What is wrong with Lita's birthmark? Do you know... ...the story behind that birthmark? No. It would be better... ...for you to find out about it soon... ...and put an end to this problem. She is very strong. She is furious... ...because you got rid of that birthmark. The wandering spirits just want the humans to notice its presence. They just need attention. And she... Once she's found out the mystery about herself and her true identity... ...she will continue to haunt both of you. I will do whatever it takes to protect my child and my wife. And she will also do whatever it takes to hurt you. What you can do for now... ...is to cover all the mirrors in this house. Because she likes to haunt you using mirrors as the medium. Tomorrow... ...make sure you bring your wife to my place. We need to put an end to this. This house feels like hell. We have to meet my mother tomorrow. I'm sure she has all the answers. After visiting Mr. Adam's place, ...we'll visit your mother's house. I know she's your child. What? What do you mean? You... ...are pregnant with two babies, Lita. So far, your khodam has been protecting you... ...and at the same time, she's also been having sex with your husband... ...while you're having sex. Do not give birth to that baby... ...because she will haunt you forever, especially your baby. Putri. Sir, please help us. This will hurt a little... ...but this is for the sake of your child. Drink these. Go on, Lita. The second one. Enough. Hang in there, Lita. Give her the third one. Go on. Give it to her. Come on, hang in there. Go on, Lita. Out. Let it out. Let it out. Come on. Let it out. Let it out! Let it out! Out! Honey. This is the fetus... ...that will later haunt your child's life. If the mother finds out, she will be very angry. We must finish this before she comes. One more thing. You need to find out... ...about the birthmark on Lita's back. Or else we will never know what the khadam actually wants. It's empty. We need to get in. There might be some information we could use. He is a pimp! You know nothing. Aceng is a marriage officiant. It's not prostitution! The marriage is legal. Mom. That's the same as contract marriage! Doesn't that make him a pimp? I didn't ask you to support me, send me to school... ...using that kind of money. Enough. Enough, Lita. Don't provoke me. Why? What are you going to say? I had enough of all this. We can be poor, but we need to hold up our morals! If we make money by selling ourselves... Never point your finger at me. If you dislike my ways, you may leave this house. Live your life with your morals. I will live my life in my own way. Let's ask the head of the village. They might know where she lives now. That house has been empty for ages. But the last occupant was Mrs. Sari, right? Yes, when she was still sane. Sane? - What do you mean? - Mrs. Sari... ...often shouts when she's alone. She brought a knife wherever she went. It got dangerous. So one of the villagers reported this to the mental institution. Ever since that happened, ...I have never heard about Mrs. Sari again. My mother is not crazy, Sir. Why did they take her to the mental institution? Calm down, Honey. Calm down. Can we have the address? Of course. Just a second. I know you're here. What do you want? Are you sure we're going through with this? We have to end this, Rama. Before it's too late. Okay. Tomorrow we'll start by visiting your mother at the hospital. I will do whatever it takes. Including sacrificing myself. For you. "Mental Institution" I know this is hard for you. Let's put an end to this. We've been looking for her relatives. No one has ever visited her. I am her daughter. It must be difficult for you to finally meet her. What do you mean? We have all the data of our patients. About their families, family problems... ...and the kind of problem that made us bring them here. I need to see her records. And if it's possible... ...can you tell me why she's traumatized and depressed? We have no idea. When she was admitted here, she was dangerous. She threatened the villagers. The villagers told us that Mrs. Sari often see ghosts. What we know is that she has been married four times. - Left by her daughter... - That's enough. I want to see her now. I am not sure the psychological condition of you two are ready for that. Please, Doctor. Mom? It's me, Lita... No! - No! - Mom? Mom? No! Mom... I was wrong... Nina, please forgive me. Nina? Mom, I'm Lita. I was wrong! I was wrong for separating the two of you. So, I have a twin all along? And my twin is haunting my mother. She's the one who made my mother lost her mind. Why would she haunt my mom? That means the scar on your back is not a birthmark. It's possible that you and Nina were Siamese twins. And in quintessence... ...that scar was a seal... ...which tied you to her. But when the scar was removed... ...she became an independent entity. She became free and no longer attached to you. She became stronger and more vicious. That ghost is not a qorin. It's a parasite-like entity that used your qorin as its dwelling. So... ...am I the trigger? I have to put an end to this, Ram. We. We will put an end to this. Hello, Miss? Why is Putri crying? Alright, thank you, Miss. She said she's going to check on Putri. She was doing the laundry. Ma'am? Five more minutes! Five more minutes! Break is over in five minutes! Doctor. Mrs. Sari is missing. Missing? Putri! Mom? How did you come here? I'm sorry, Lita. That's a picture of you and your twin. Her name was Nina. This is all my fault. I couldn't choose... ...between the two of you... ...because the two of you shared one heart. It wasn't fair for Nina. It's my fault. It's my fault. So it's true that I was a Siamese twin? And you made a decision for me to live? And my twin... ...died for me? The heart that we shared... ...you gave it to me? I'm sorry, Lita. I'm sorry, Mom. - Forgive me, Mom. - I was wrong. My granddaughter is beautiful. She's healthy. Beautiful, just like you. Mom! Open your eyes. This is Nina. Rama, help! Rama, help me! Where are you going? This is all your fault. You've erased the scar that marks my birth into this world. You've taken away my memory? This is also your fault. Because you killed my baby. It was in your body. The child of our husband. Nina! No! I want your heart. And I have to kill the baby. Lita. Where are you? Lita... Go away! Enough, Nina! This isn't our fault! I never knew about that scar. I didn't even know we were twins! If I did... - ...I would never... - It's not that easy. You killed my baby... ...and I will kill yours. So you can feel what I feel. Nina! I want to trade our heart for my baby's life. Don't hurt our mother and my baby. I'll return this heart to you. But you have to promise... ...that you will not hurt our mother and my baby. Promise me, Nina. Lita. Good morning, Mrs. Lita. Here is your baby. You seem to be recovering well after the surgery. I should get going, Mrs. Lita. Excuse me. My name is not Lita, Doctor. I'm Nina.
