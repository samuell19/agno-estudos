[Arguing and commotion] Man: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. Now, if we start the encirclement in this sector and maneuver the enemy's troops out of the central defense lines, why, the counterattack must be successful. Second man: That stinks! I beg your pardon. Walter Winchell said last night-- will you listen to me? Now, here are the Nazis. So what have they got, tanks? So what's a tank? In '29, they used 'em in Chicago. Armored cars. You're living in the past. The layout's a cinch. Remember how Willie's mob mowed down those West Side boys? I'll never forget it! That's how the British should do it. Now... The fleet muscles in at this spot, we hijack their ammunition, the R.A.F. Spits on Berlin, and we catch them with their panzers down. [Laughter] The way you're doing it, we'll lose the war. What? You're backing us right into another Dunkirk. Smart guy, where'd you learn to be a general, in the Bronx? I've served some of the greatest authorities of our times, to wit: Gunther, Kaltenborn, Raymond, Graham, swing. Listen, four-eyes, if you don't keep quiet, I'll serve you with a blackout. 20 years. Take those glasses off and I'll pop you in the nose. Oh, yeah? Don't let that stop you. I don't need the glasses. Where's everybody? [Laughter] Where are you, fellas? Wait a minute, sunshine. I think the general's got a point. What point?! When you take into consideration the carastan on the tagabrue with dive bombers-- I told you that the fleet muscles in here, the R.A.F.-- what did you say? I said the Carastan on the tagabrue is a very serious problem. To say nothing of the larrisanc Faye. Cut out the double talk, and don't camouflage your ignorance. Listen, we know just as much about doping out this war as you do, ignoramus. Ignoramus? I'll shove a tank down your throat. I'll stab you with this-- man: Here comes the boss. Hey, what's going on here? Man: Hello, boss. How are you? I could hear you boys clear down to 42nd street. Hey, what is all this? A few things I picked up at the five-and-ten. Second childhood, huh? This character thinks he's an expert on the international situation. Just showing the boys how England can win the war, Gloves. I'll arrange a conference between you and Churchill. Now let's get down to serious business. Serious business? This is serious business, Gloves. Don't you think it's time you got your mind out of the sports section and onto the front page? I can't be bothered. That's Washington's racket. Let them handle it. Now, will the ambassador from Belmont park kindly give me a report on the racing situation? I clocked sweet dream this morning at 1:40. Yeah? What's the morning line? 3 to 1. 5 grand on the schnoz. Caught kid O'Brien's workout this morning. How's his left? Like a machine gun. 10 grand he wins in 3 rounds. 10 grand on O'Brien? What's the matter with O'Brien? Nothing. I like him. I also like my mother, but she can't fight, either. Bring me my coffee and cheesecake, Louie. Yes, Mr. Donahue. Right away, sir. Cheesecake for Mr. Donahue. Cheesecake for Mr. Donahue. Cheesecake for Mr. Donahue. Cheesecake for Mr. Donahue. Cheesecake for Mr. Donahue. We have a problem. No cheesecake? Plenty, but not from Miller's bakery. What are we going to do? He only likes it from Miller's bakery. Give him the national cheesecake. It's a reasonable facsimile. I wouldn't advise it. You wouldn't know the difference. Sunshine: Incidentally, Samson is twirling for the tigers today. Incidentally, Samson's got a glass arm. Here you are, Mr. Donahue. Put 5 yards on the yanks. 5 yards on the yanks. OK, boss. You better get those bets down. Man: Hi, boys! Hi, fellas. Hiya, Barney. Hello, coach. I got the money from Callahan. Did he give easy? Just like extracting a molar. Any message? Should I leave out the curse words? No message. Dry cleaner-- what'd he say? He says he ain't no welsher, but in his opinion the taxi bet was a frame. He says 4 even license numbers in a row just don't happen to come along. Hey, there's a miracle on 48th street. He's got a nerve, accusing us of bribery. Ain't he, though? Here, pay off those hackies, and tell 'em it was nice timing. After that, coach, can I beat it? No, you got to drive us out to the ballpark. Can't I skip the ball game? I got a date with a doll. Bring her along. We got something planned. Anything you're going to do you can do at the ballpark. I don't think so. Hey, Louie. Yes, Mr. Donahue. When I order cheesecake, I don't expect to get mucilage. I'm sorry, Mr. Donahue, but-- this is not Miller's cheesecake. He didn't come today yet...Today. Why not? We don't know. There's a new invention called the telephone. You could've used it. Let me get you something else maybe. A nice French doughnut oozin' with jelly? You tell Charlie to take his cheesecake from Miller's only... Or else. Wait a minute, Mr. Donahue. Can't you-- cut out the arguments. Can't you read? Who's smokin'? Flowers? Oh, hello, Herman. Hello, gents, you are not leaving? I got a business engagement at Yankee stadium. But you didn't have your cheesecake yet. I haven't got time for that now. I'll have two for supper tonight. What happened to you? Oh, nothing, nothing. I got a little pain in my back. Aw, that's too bad. See Dr. Lachelle and tell him I sent you. Oh, say, you going to see my old lady? Naturally. Well, here, give her this. Tell her if I make out good at the game she's got herself a new sable. Here you are, Lottie. Thank you. Here, buy yourself a yacht. Thanks, Gloves. You done a good job, boys. Hey, Gloves, won't you please reconsider my request? This date is personally important to me. See the dame tomorrow. But I'm aging fast! I want to take advantage of my youth. Whoa. Woman: Mr. Miller. Hello, Mrs. Donahue. Did you see my son? Yes. How is he? Fine, fine! Any circles under his eyes? I didn't see any. For you. For me? Oh, no! Ain't that sweet of him? I'll be down in a few minutes. Thank you, Mrs. Helen. Come again. Good day. Hello, Anna. Oh, it's good you came back. I promised Mrs. Schulz this birthday cake for half-past 2:00. Anna. Yes? There's somebody here to see me? No. Do you expect anybody? No, no. I was just asking. Herman, what's the matter? Is anything wrong? No, no. You go deliver the cake. I will talk to you when you come back. There's something I have to tell you. Herman? Don't worry. [Man humming] Thank you. [Resumes humming] Hello, papa Miller, how is everything? [Sharply] Hello. [Mimicking] Hello. You're not very polite today. You didn't ask me how I am. Look! The candies I like. I'll have a few. You don't mind? Have some popcorn? No. No? No. See, papa Miller, you have been a very busy man lately. I've been watching for you all morning. Deliveries. A man must make a living. Of course. But I must make a living, too. Excuse me, I have some work to do. [Man begins humming] Tell me, papa Miller, were you down at the pier this morning? You know I go to the pier every morning. Then you got the information from Schiller? No. Oh, you didn't? No. I won't do this kind of work anymore. You won't? Perhaps you need a little encouragement. You don't frighten me. Frighten you? I didn't want to frighten you. I merely wanted to warn you. You see, tonight's job is very, very important. I don't care. I won't do it. I thought it over. You are criminals, murderers. I won't have any part-- perhaps now you'll change your mind. No. You can beat me. You can do whatever you want, but I won't do it, and I won't let you do it. I'll stop all of you. I will tell the police. I will tell everybody. No! This is very exasperating. A man on first, a man on second, a man on third, 2 out, 3 balls and 2 strikes, and we have to leave the game. Why? Yeah, why? I don't know, but my old lady says it's urgent... In unison: And when she says it's urgent, it's urgent. You gonna be long, coach? What do you care? Somebody's waitin' for me. And that's urgent, too. Hello, mom. What's the trouble? Hello, son, I am glad you're here. I got here as quick as I could. I hated to call you from the ball game, but he isn't here. Who isn't here? Mr. Miller. I just saw him a little while ago downtown. I know! It's just as if the earth opened up and swallowed him. Yeah? Where's Mrs. Miller? She's inside. Come on. You boys wait out here. [Woman crying] Hello, Mrs. Miller. Now, now, Mrs. Miller, stop crying. We'll find Herman for you. There's nothing to worry about. That's what I told her. No, no. Something's happened. I'm sure of it. Maybe he just took a walk around the block. No, no! When did you last see him? Just after lunch. Yes, just after lunch. Mrs. Miller went out for a few minutes, and I come down to get the flowers you'd sent me, and he was gone. Anybody see him leave? No! Johnny was standing right out there by his popcorn stand the whole time. And he never saw him come out. And the back door was locked from the inside. Did he say anything or do anything to make you think he might be in trouble? Oh, well... No! Why would he be in trouble? Sure he never harmed a person-- mom, will you let Mrs. Miller answer my questions, please? Well, he did say there was something he wanted to tell me when I got back. People don't just disappear for no reason. Well, I don't know. Now, now, Mrs. Miller, don't you cry. We'll find him for you. Anybody search the place? Why, sure we've looked around. We didn't see a sign of him. Come on, we'll search the joint. Sure, we got time to burn. Let's go up the attic, down in the basement. We'll start in the basement and work our way up. Maybe we can find a clue. You'll see, Mrs. Miller, my boy'll find him. I'm a promoter, mom. I'm not J. Edgar hoover. I hope nothing's happened to him. Oh. What do you make of it? I had an uncle once who used to disappear like this, and every time they'd find him in Atlantic city with a dame named Clarissa. You know I'm only doing this to satisfy my old lady. Your old lady. All I know is every time we get settled at the race track, the ball game, or the prize fight, she has to call up and disturb us. Why don't you get her a penthouse on park Avenue and isolate her? I tried that once, but she likes the old neighborhood. All her pals are down here. There's nothing here. Let's go. [Metal clanging] [Cat meows] What's the matter, pussy? That's a nice cat. Come here, pussy. How about that? [Woman screams] Herman! I can't figure it. A nice old gent like Miller. Who would want to knock him off? I hope this isn't a clue... Because I just swallowed it. ...waiting here a whole hour. Say, chief, can't I get away just long enough to give my girl a quick hello? Stick around, will you? What are you so nervous about? She'll keep. That's what you think. I can't take a chance. The fleet's in, and she's defense-minded. Come on, Romeo, get out of here. Well, mom, how's Mrs. Miller? Oh, how can she be? We've got to find out who did this. Why, he never harmed a person in his life. There, now, now, this won't do any good. You'll make yourself sick. We'll let the cops handle this. That's their business. Woman: Excuse me. I'd...I'd like to see Mr. Miller, please. I'm sorry, sister. He--he ain't here. Oh. Do you know where I can find him? What do you want to see him about? Well, it--it's personal. You're too late. He was found dead a half an hour ago. Dead? Murdered. Oh, Gloves. I want to talk to you. Just a minute. What the... Officer: Not so fast, Donahue. Just where do you think you're going? I was just standing here talking to a dame, and I turned around, and she's gone. Even with a murderer around you have to talk to dames. Don't tell me there's a new city ordinance against that. You just be available. The D.A. Will want to know your version of this. Hey, what are you trying to do, get me mixed up in this? Miller was a friend of mine. I've been eating his cheesecake for 10 years. I'm just up here trying to help the community. Just make sure you don't leave the community. How about that? Don't forget the policeman's ball ain't so far off. Son, did you notice anything peculiar about that girl? Peculiar? She does a great vanishing act, if that's what you mean. Yes, why did she run away like that? Maybe she was scared. The puss on that lieutenant's enough to scare anybody. No. I've seen her here before talking to Mr. Miller. So what? That girl knows something. Aw, now, ma, you can't suspect everybody that comes into the bakery to buy a loaf a bread. Yes, but there's something-- sunshine: What do you want him to do, Mrs. Donahue, spend the rest of his life trying to find out who killed cock Robbin? No! But as sure as-- I know how you feel, but let's be sensible about this. Let the cops handle it. You go on home and buy yourself a new hat. And here's a couple of hundred bucks for Mrs. Miller. If she needs any more, let me know. So long, mom. Good-bye, son. Gloves: All right, Barney, drive me home. Say, Johnny, did you see a girl come out of here a few minutes ago? Excuse me, boss. Hey, Saratoga. Yes, sir. Isn't that my tie you got on? Yes, sir. And my shirt? Yes, sir. What are you doing with my belt? You don't want your pants to fall down, do you, boss? I'll talk to you later. Yes, sir. Hey, where's Barney? I don't know. He took a run out after we left the bakery. I think he's got ants in his romance. Get him for me, will you? Sunshine: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sunshine... I got something hot at the end of the wire. Yeah? Cowboys from Wyoming? All right, all right. How much have they got in traveler's checks? 20 grand, at least. Listen, tell Gloves this is the opportunity of a lifetime. It's their first trip to New York. The sky's the limit, and they're raring to go. OK, Spats, keep 'em on ice. Your apartment in an hour. I just staked a claim to a gold mine. Spats dug up a couple of Wyoming types in town on a convention. They would like to spend a nice, sociable evening playing tiddlywinks. I hope they're good losers. I'll make sure. I'll bring my deck. [Telephone rings] For whom do the bells toll now? Yeah? Hello, let me talk to Gloves. This is Marty Callahan. Callahan? What do you want? Just a minute. Mr. Callahan would like to converse with you. Yeah, what is it, obnoxious? Hello, Gloves, say, what are you trying to do, put me out of business? I run an ultra-high-class joint here, and if you think you can drag me into some murder rap-- what? Wait a minute, translate that into English, will you? What? Who? Your old lady. Your mother. She's down here crabbing my whole setup with some beef about some guy named Miller, some bakery, some murder rap. Now, look, if you don't come down and get her out of here, I ain't gonna be responsible, see? OK, OK. Don't have a nervous breakdown. I'll be right over. Here, get me out of this. Yes, sir. What's up, I'm afraid? We're going to the duchess club. This is no time for a rumba lesson. It isn't a rumba, it's my mother. Your mother? What's she doing there? Maybe if we're lucky, she's dug up another dead body. [Knock on door] Hiya, coach. I did it, I did it. Annabelle and me just got married. I'm the happiest man in the world. Congratulations. Come on. But, coach, I and the bride want to go on a short honeymoon. Next month, Casanova. Sorry, miss. I'm sorry, honey. Excuse me, sunshine. Good-bye, honey. Come on, come on! See ya' later, kid. Married 20 minutes and already I'm a widow. Don't worry, miss, things ain't always as black as they looks. Mrs. Donahue: I can stay here if I want to, and I want to stay here! Callahan: You're getting all my customers conscience-stricken, and you're busting up my show. Take it easy, Marty, this glamour girl you're pushing around happens to be my mother. Ain't I got enough trouble with you? Do I have to have your mother? I'm warning you, don't start up with my son. I'm telling you and your son both I don't know any guy named Miller. I don't know nothin' about any murder, and stop upsettin' my Prima Donna. Be sweet, will you? Will you scram? All right, Marty, all right. Gee, ma, what are you doing down here at this time of the night? Don't be angry with me, son. But that girl's here. What girl? The one who came to the bakery. My star performer don't go in no cheap bakeries. That's what you think. Now, if you talk to her, you'll find out who killed Miller. I told you a thousand times she don't know any guy named Miller. Don't go to pieces, Marty. What makes you think she knows anything about it? Son, I've got a feeling. And you know when-- [everybody] You've got a feeling, you've got a feeling. You've got a feeling? Who is this dame? Her name is Leda Hamilton. She sings here. Songs. Foreign-type songs. Now will you take your old lady home? My customers start thinking about home and mother, I'm a dead duck. And you know it. Now get her out of here! That big blow-hard. I'd like to-- all right, mom, where is this dame? Here. Woman: * Cheri, Cheri, my own * * Cheri... * that's her. Are you sure it's the same girl? Why, of course. Take a good look at her. * oh, I could play you a thousand ways * * I'll say it all in that old sweet way... * she's not bad. What's that? I said it's a sad song. Maitre d': Table, sir? No, not just yet. OK, mom, I'll have a talk with her. You do that, son. Ask her what she knows. Oh, sure. I'll find out everything. Including address, telephone number, and open dates. Sunshine, put my mother in a cab, and have Starchy take her home. It'll be a pleasure. Good night, mom. I'll give you a full report in the morning. You do that, son. Good night, and go to bed early. Oh, yes, I'll go to bed early. * I love you * * love you * * that's what I... * hey, Joe. What's he doing here? Him and his old lady's been driving me nuts. If he wants a table, tell him we're all filled up. If he starts cracking, heave him out. I'll do it in reverse. I'll make him feel like a fish peddler. We're all sold out, Mr. Donahue. Hello, Joe. What do ya' know? Don't say that to me. Look, Donahue, our prices are too high for you. You'd look much better carrying your own tray. Besides, we only cater to the smart set. One of your off nights, eh? I'm only going to be here a few minutes. What time is it? You done that on purpose. Now, don't get me mad, Donahue, I got a bad temper. You also got a bad memory. 3 months in a plaster cast the last time you tangled with me. Thanks for reminding me. That's still one I got to pay off. Back to your smart set, Reginald. Fish peddler. * that's what I mean * * when I whisper Cheri * * my own * thank you, ladies and gentlemen. And now I would like to do a number that I first sang in Paris at the belle tableau. [Orchestra begins] * all through the night * * you are mine * * deep in a star-spangled dream * * you are mine * * all through the dream, violins sing to me * * and all through the song, I feel you cling to me * * all through the day, I'm alone * * I know that twilight will make you my own * * who cares if dreams never come true? * * I share them all through the night with you * Gloves: Miss Hamilton. Yes? Remember me? Gloves Donahue. Well, I... I know, you meet so many people. That's it. Miller's bakery this afternoon. I'd like to have a little conference with you. I, uh... Suppose we step over to the bar. We'll have a drink. All right. What'll you have? Sherry, please. Sherry for the lady and a double Martini for me. Yes, sir. Now, miss Hamilton, I don't mind telling you, you can certainly sling those obbligtatos around. Thanks. Woman: Hello, Gloves. Hi, uh... Nice kid. I met her at the junior prom. Now, what was it you wanted to talk to me about? Well, I don't know exactly how to begin this beguine. My old lady had a feeling that you might be able to tell me something about Miller's death. Said she and the neighbors used to see you down at the place quite often. Well, of course. I--I was a customer. I seem to remember you were saying this afternoon that it was something personal. Did I? Yeah. I can't remember anything I said. I was so upset. Well, that makes sense. I'm sorry I bothered you, miss Hamilton. Not at all. See, my old lady was pretty upset. The Millers were good friends of ours. Yes, I know. Huh? If there's anything I could do for his family, I... I never met Mrs. Miller. But he certainly was one of the nicest men I've ever known. Yes, he was OK. My only complaint is that he didn't tell me about you. Well, that's too bad. He told me all about you, though. No fooling? No fooling. He knew you ever since you went to public school 139. Your real name is Alfred, but you keep it a secret. Yeah, and don't you give it away. What else? You gave him a dozen ties for Christmas. You eat his cheesecake 3 times a day and make every restaurant on Broadway buy it, or else. Oh, now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Miller never gave you that "or else" business. No. Mr. Callahan. And he intimated that you were a no-good, double-crossing, chiseling-- which one do you want to believe? I'll tell you some other time. OK. [Glasses clink] Leda: I'm sorry, Mr. Donahue. But I couldn't possibly leave Mr. Callahan right now. Oh, hello, Pepi. Pepi, this is Mr. Donahue. Mr. Donahue, this is Pepi, my accompanist. Hiya. Mr. Donahue is opening a new club in a few weeks. Oh, is he? Yes, and he's asked me to work for him. Oh, he did? Yeah, it's a brand-new idea. I was thinking miss Hamilton here is quite an attraction. Isn't she? But we are perfectly happy here, are we not? Of course. And, now, Mr. Donahue, if you will excuse us. I'd like to finish my drink, please. But we have to rehearse. Didn't you hear her? The lady said she'd like to finish her drink. And I said we have no time. I wouldn't advise you to do that. Do what? Listen, weasel, back to your piano. Please, Mr. Donahue. I don't like the way he's pushing you around. It isn't important. Please don't interfere. Come on. Let her alone. Take your hands off me. Just a minute, Mr. Donahue. We don't want any disturbance here. I warned you when you came in. Oh, he's just trying to persuade her to quit Mr. Callahan. Oh, chiseling again, huh? I'm afraid we'll have to ask you to leave, Mr. Donahue. Lightly and politely. Why don't you shut up? I'm getting hoarse listening to you. Good night, Mr. Donahue. Miss Hamilton-- now would you leave? Or do you want a sample of our Southern hospitality. OK, Reginald. Spread a carpet for him on his way out. Better talk to that dame. [Man and woman arguing in German] [Gunshot] [Woman screams] Good night. And you'd better not come back. Thanks for the tip. Can we go now, coach? I've been waiting here so long the mayor offered me a job as a fireplug. For all the good I'm doing here, I might as well be one, too. You know, I'm worried about that canary. She's in some kind of a jam. May I remind you we have a rendezvous with a couple of cowboys? That can wait. Be back in a minute. Well, we're here for the duration. I don't get it. I marry Annabelle, and I spend my honeymoon with you. Well, I can cook. [Engine revving] [Big band music] Now, don't start anything, Joe, I'm going to talk to this Hamilton dame. Joe. Joe, what's the matter? The dame. They got the dame. What are you talking about? Who got the dame? What are you trying to tell me, Joe? Hey, which way did that cab go? What cab? The diamond cab that just popped out of the alley. I didn't see no cab. What's up, coach? What's the matter? Somebody just bumped off Joe denning and grabbed the dame. What? Drive me down to the diamond garage. I gotta trace that cab. Here we go again, boys. Got any idea who bumped Joe off? No. He died before he could tell me. All he did was hold up his hand like this. What for? Maybe he wanted to leave the room. Shut up. The guy is dead. I'm reasonably sorry. Pat? Smitty. Did you pick up a fare at the stage entrance of the duchess club about 8:30? If you see Frankie Cole, tell him to call in. What about it? No soap yet, Gloves. But we'll trace it sooner or later. You're sure it was one of our cabs? Positive. It almost flattened me. We'll find out as soon as Frankie calls in. The duchess club's his beat. When are you gonna let me scram, coach? Annabelle's waiting for me. Quiet down, will ya', Barney? After all, I'm a married man. I got obligations. All right! Send her flowers. That wasn't my idea. Radio announcer: We interrupt our regular program to bring you this latest new bulletin. Joe Denning, well-known night club operator and partner of Marty Callahan, owner of the duchess club, was found dead tonight with a bullet hole in his back. A glove found near the body was identified as the property of Gloves Donahue, man-about-town, and well-known figure in the sporting world. Callahan accuses Donahue of the murder. Police are now searching for Donahue, who was last seen driving a long, black car, license number 2-2-o-o-7-7. All citizens are asked to report sight of the car... Murder! How about that? Blasting my good name all over the air. You'd think Callahan would know me better than that. I suggest we visit the D.A.'S office and deny everything ipso facto. Yeah, that's good. That's all I gotta do is walk in there, and I'll never get out. He's been trying to hang something on me for years. There's no use denying it. We're practically outlaws. Poor Annabelle, married to an accessory before the fact. Listen, Smitty, I've gotta find that dame now. I'm doing my best. [Telephone rings] Maybe this is Frankie now. Hello. Listen, Frankie... Did you make a haul from the duchess bar about 8:30 tonight? Yeah? Where to? Uh-huh. OK. You're in luck, Gloves. Frankie picked up this customer and took him to a warehouse at 733 east 61st street. Lend me a cab, will you? My car is hot. Sure. Go ahead. Thanks. And if anybody asks you, you ain't seen us. You know me. How many years do you get if they give you life? Nice, cheerful little neighborhood. Friend of mine got his skull crushed down here last week. For what? For nothing. "I.J. Madison, importers and exporters." Now, this can't be the place. That's the address Smitty gave us-- 733 east 61st street. Maybe he got his numbers mixed up. I'll ring the bell and ask the landlady. Wait a minute. Maybe the landlady won't like us. You douse the lights and wait here. Alone, Gloves? Yeah. Come with me, sunshine. How long you gonna be gone, fellas? What do you care? You got your insurance paid. That friend of yours, how is he? Fine. He's dead. What are you gonna do now? Try to figure out a way to get in here. Well, allow me. I suddenly remember something from my youth. Good evening, officer. How are you? This your cab? Yes, sir. Better get it out of here before somebody takes it away from you. I can't. I'm waiting for a fare. Stick around. You'll get one. There ain't a night passes we don't pick a stiff or two out of the river. Thanks. You're welcome. [Both laugh] Oh... Personally, I'd feel more comfortable if I had a rod. Here lies sunshine under the sod. That's not odd, he had no rod. You know, there are times when I wonder about you. What would a sweetheart like that Hamilton dame be doing in a dump like this? Maybe she still believes in Santie Claus. [Toy xylophone plays] Quiet! I must have slipped. You must have slipped. All right, dig yourself out of there and let's go. This is not my idea how to spend a pleasant evening. Right now I could be dealing myself a straight flush. If I could only figure out what Joe meant when he held up his hand. I know he must've been trying to tell me something or show me something. [Clattering] You are the noisiest guy. I wonder what's up there. You know, I think we ought to-- hey, sunshine. Sunshine! Hey, sunshine! [Motor whirring] [Gunshot] Hey, Barney! What happened to you? You look like you've been rolled. I had a little trouble with a guy inside. Where'd you get that? Same place. Say, you seen sunshine? No, coach, he's with you. Coach, he ain't with you! Somebody yanked him on an elevator and took him up to the third floor, and I followed him. When I got there, I couldn't find a thing. No sunshine? No sunshine and no third floor. But you just said you got to the third floor. I did, I did. It's all clear to me, ain't it? Wait a minute, I got an idea. This building must connect with one on the next street. That's right. They both come together. Come on. Drive me around the corner. You better brush up. You look terrible. Drive slow. It oughta be just about in the middle of the block. There. Stop in front of that auction shop. Maybe it's a front. Gloves: Continental art galleries. High-class joint. Yeah. Hey, how do I look? Oh, fine. OK, let's go. Auctioneer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, we offer you a most extraordinary piece, this George I secretary bookcase. As you can see, it is in excellent condition. An original piece of the period, it was for many years a part of the famous holbrook collection. Now surely there's someone here who would appreciate the beauty of this magnificent piece. Looks like an old-fashioned revival meeting. Shh. Will somebody say $3,000 for this superb secretary? Woman: 1,250. 1,250. I'm offered 1,250. Can I hear 1,500? $1,500? 1,500. I am bid 1,500. Can I hear 2,500? $2,500? 2,250. Thank you, madame. 2,250. And now, please, I have 2,250. May I hear $2,500? $2,500? May I help you? No. I'm just looking around. Is there anything in particular you're interested in? Yeah, but nothing around here seems to catch my fancy. Perhaps if you could tell me what you're looking for. What you got in there, in that room? Oh, that's the cashier's office. Oh. Well, I'll just stick around. Something might strike my eye. You ain't kidding, neither. Auctioneer: $2,500, once, twice, and sold to that very charming lady in the second row. This way, madame, please. I think I better have a look in there. Woman: You'll find the cashier in here. Auctioneer: And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the next item to be offered, I have here this exquisite... Madame. The man in the second row on the aisle, that's Donahue. Tell Ebbing. Ebbing: But ladies and gentlemen, $500 is ridiculous. Once marshal Ney sat at this desk, and Napoleon, too. Do I hear more? One grand. Ebbing: I believe that's $1,000, isn't it? Gloves: Check. I have $1,000. May I hear 1,500? May I hear $1,500? $1,500? 1,500. Ebbing: 1,500. I'm offered 1,500. Do I hear more? Gloves: Two gs. Two gs! Um, that's $2,000? You got it. You're gonna pay 2 grand for that broken-down table? Relax. I know what I'm doing. I'm offered $2,000. May I have $2,500? $2,500, please? 2,500. I'll see the lady and raise her 5. That's $3,000, I believe. That's right, brother. Ebbing: $3,000, I have $3,000. Do I hear more? Do I hear more? Save your breath, lady, it won't do you any good. Ebbing: $3,000, once, twice, and sold to that very distinguished gentleman. And may I congratulate you. Wait here. Excuse me, I'll have the cashier come out here for your convenience. There's no inconvenience at all. But I'm sure you'd find it more profitable to remain. There are so many wonderful items for a collector. I've got all I want out here, sister. Substitute auctioneer: And now ladies and gentlemen, we are going to offer you a magnificent set of rockingham China... How do you do, sir? I will attend to this gentleman personally. Won't you sit down? Oh, thanks. Nice show you put on out there. Thank you. How would you like to pay? Got a blank check? Certainly. Here we are. Got a pen? Of course. Aw, it broke. Oh. Another antique, eh? Try this one, sir. Fascinating idea, a blank check, if you ever stop to think about it. Yes, very fascinating. This is a nice layout you got here. Full of stuff to tempt the eyes, as they say. Perhaps we could tempt you with something to go with a desk? Oh, no. No, thanks. Oh, you wouldn't happen to have anything in the toy line, would you? Toys? No antique toys. No, modern. When my nephew gets through with them, they'll be antique. Ha ha ha! That's very charming. There you are. [Elevator starts] What's that? The ventilating system. Yeah? Well, somebody took a shot at me in that ventilating system of yours and hijacked a pal of mine. Keep your hands in front of you. I beg your pardon? Now, listen, Buddy, I don't know what your racket is. And I'm trying not to move in. But I gotta know one thing. Where's miss Hamilton? Miss Hamilton? Yeah. I'm afraid you have us confused with the bureau of missing persons. Madame, will you show this gentleman the door? Certainly. I'd advise you to butt out, madame. You know, you're not a bad-looking character. I'd hate to see that fine nose of yours smeared all over your pan. I gotta know, where's miss Hamilton? Oh, hello, baby. I don't know what these monkeys are trying to do to you, but you got nothing to worry about now. I'm here. I wouldn't advise you to do that. The little lady and I are going out. Don't bother me now. I'm busy. You say Donahue followed you here from the club? That's right. Who was with him? Two of his friends. One we got in a warehouse. The other is downstairs in the auction room. Did they find out anything? I don't think so. This man, Leda, is he a friend of yours? No. I met him tonight for the first time. What were they doing at the club? Oh, talking. But very intimately. What about? He offered me a job. He's opening a new club. What does he do, Pepi? Oh, he's a Broadway big shot. Very belligerent personality. [Intercom buzzes] Yes? Man on intercom: Fleischer's here. Send him in. Schroeder and Holzmeir will be late. The plane has been forced down at Harrisburg. Bad weather. Tell them they must get here as quickly as possible. They must take a chance. Come in, Fleischer. Did you bring the drawings? I couldn't do it. It wasn't possible. You had your instructions. If those drawings disappear, I'll be held responsible. As foreman of the plant, the police would come to see me first. I can't do it. I must keep my job. And the next time, I break your neck. Ebbing: Now get me those drawings. We must have them tonight. I'm sure he'll bring them now. Pepi, you'd better look after Donahue. Arrange to have a truck take him and his friend to New Jersey. Madame, get rid of the other one downstairs. What about this girl? We will discuss it later. Later? Why not now? I said we will discuss it later. But Pepi hasn't told you all about her. This afternoon, she-- madame, I know my duty. I hope you know yours. What about the meeting? Are you still holding it here? Why not? Isn't it dangerous after what's happened? It will take more than Mr. Donahue to disrupt my schedule. I told you what to do. Do it. Get Steinem on the phone. Wait in my study, Leda. The meeting will be held at 3:00. Tell everybody to use the warehouse entrance. Auctioneer: I am offered 750. 750 once, 750 twice, sold to Mr. marlin for 750. We'll charge that to your account, sir. And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes our session for tonight. Next week we are offering the contents of a Southampton estate. I hope to see you all then. Good night, and thank you for coming. Good night. Are you waiting for someone? Yes, ma'am, I'm waiting for my friend. He's kind of a tall, dark, handsome-like gentleman. I don't seem to remember him. Yes, you do. He's the one that bought the fancy desk. Paid quite a lot of scratch for it, too. Oh, yes. The Louis xv with the gilt ormolu. No, ma'am. Just a desk. But that was some time ago. He paid for it... And left. No. He wouldn't leave without me. I'm just like his right hand. We was kids together down on the east side. I'm sorry I haven't time to listen to your biography. We're closing now. I must ask you to go. I'm sorry, ma'am. I ain't moving a budge without my friend. Then I shall insist. Look it, lady, when we started out tonight there was 3 of us. 20 minutes later there was only 2. Now there's only one. One of us ain't enough to leave here alone. I'll go and see it myself. Hello. Will you show this gentleman to the door, Anton? Careful, Buddy, I got a very nasty temper. You don't intimidate me. I'm warning you. I'll tell the police. I'll tell them he's here. Why don't you? I understand they, too, are looking for Mr. Donahue. Oh. Good night. Good night, ma'am. I'm going. I said good night, didn't I? What are you doing here? Ebbing asked me to wait for him. Where is he? In the office. You can see him there. He asked me to wait for him here. Madame, there is no reason for you to dislike me. I not only dislike you, I distrust you. But I'm sure you know that if ever you attempted to betray us, your father will be the first to hear of it and the first to pay for it. And if you have any idea that your friend Mr. Donahue could help you, you can give that up, too. Pepi will take care of him. Hey. Hey. That you, sunshine? If it ain't, I've been doing a lot of suffering for the wrong party. Quiet. These knots must've been tied by the number one boy scout. Untie me, will you? Glad to be of service. How do them seals get around so fast? What happened to you? A gentleman persuaded me to look at his etchings. What persuaded you? That dame. The dame? Yeah. That makes the evening perfect. Wait'll the boys at Charlie's hear about this. Yeah. Couple of smart guys we are. Speak for yourself. You and that cheesecake started all this. Why couldn't you-- aw, lay off, will you? [Door opens] There's a door... The end of the hall. It leads to the docks. I don't figure you, sister. First you slug me, now you're trying to help me. Who killed Joe denning? The same man who killed Miller. That doesn't add up, Miller and Joe knocked off by the same party. I can't untie these. Skip that. Try my hands. Now listen, sister, I've been tagged for Joe's murder. The cops are looking for me all over town. I've got to clear myself. Who killed Joe Denning? I can't tell you. [Approaching footsteps] I've got to leave. Gloves: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. There's a cigarette lighter in this pocket here. Give it to me. Good luck. How can you trust this girl? Why are you so blind about her? If you don't mind, I will handle this. Call me the moment Schroeder arrives. Sit down, Leda. I have neglected you, my little Hansel, yes. But now we are going to play. Here you are. Hup. And now let's go on, Leda. Pepi tells me you went to see Miller today. I was in the shop, if that's what you mean. Why? I've been buying things there for quite some time. Uh-huh. Madame seems to think you went for some other reason. Madame has a fabulous imagination. Ask her if she and Miller weren't working against us. That isn't true. Then why did you bring Donahue here? I didn't bring him here. I accidentally met him. If he followed me, it wasn't my fault. I tried my best to discourage him. How did he find you? I don't know. But he could have shot his way out of here tonight. And he would, if I hadn't stopped him. I think that is your answer. Does that satisfy you? Apparently it satisfies you. It does. If anything goes wrong tonight, it will be your fault. The responsibility rests with you. I am glad you recognize my position. I hope you don't forget it. Come on, Willie, put them in those crates. And now, gentlemen, you are going on a nice little trip. Unfortunately, you won't see much of the scenery. You weren't thinking of putting us in those crates, are you? Oh, certainly. Sunshine: Are we goin' parcel post or C.O.D.? Don't you worry about that. You'll arrive. Come. Hurry up, Willie. I hope you'll enjoy New Jersey. Bon voyage. [Pepi humming] [Hammering] [Workers speaking German] [Thud] Quiet those dogs of yours, will ya'? What kind of a place is this? I don't know, but nobody's gonna tie me up again. Quiet. I got some Indian blood in me. What are you gonna do? "Principal airways." "Arterial highways." Looks like public school 167. I got expelled from there. "Crude oil." Get a load of the spelling. Steel. Ah, things are looking up. What kind of a radio is that? That's a shortwave outfit. What goes on here? I don't know. I don't get it. Hold on. Aha! Mm-hmm. Schicklgruber, the house painter. Yeah. I recognize the face, but I don't know where to put it. Hey, there's more here than meets the F.B.I. Say... Do you know something? We've been playing tag with a bunch of fifth columnists. Wait a minute. What's the matter, you don't like the manicure? 5. Fivers. That's what Joe was trying to tell me! How about that? A bunch of fifth columnists on 61st street, 2 blocks off fifth Avenue. How about that? I told you it was time you got your mind out of the sports section and onto the front page, didn't I? Shh. [Man speaking German] Sure. Herr Ebbing? Herr Ebbing? [Thud, body hits floor] Very good. Joe DiMaggio couldn't have done better. I used to bat .320 at reform school. Put that guy in the closet. How about getting out of here and having a little talk with the cops? Better take a few souvenirs. The police are frequently skeptical. [Desk drawer banging] Do you remember anything else from your youth? Yeah, but they gave me 3 years to forget it. You and the elephants, huh? What's that? I don't know. Looks like a who's who. Hey. Hey, get a load of this. Miller was one of this outfit. You mean cheesecake Miller? Yeah. Take a look. Remember that fire on the Brooklyn docks? Yeah. This outfit. Holy smoke. These guys have really been busy. Hey, boss, I don't want to blast your romance, but your big moment, miss Leda Hamilton, is one of these bund babies, too. "Leda Hamilton, "uda hammel, father in d-a-c-h-a-u." Dachau. Where's that? Never heard of it. Must be one of those towns across the drink. What's the difference. It says there he's dead, anyway. But this don't make any sense. If she's one of this mob, why did she help us? This is no time for "information, please". C'mon, let's get out of here. I think I'll take this along. It might come in handy. I'm gonna take a look around. Come on. Take a peek down there. If you hear a blowout, you'll know I bumped into Gary. [Voices] ...discontent and confusion. Do you ever look at the faces of these Americans as they read the headlines? Already we have split them into angry little groups flying at each other, unconscious they are doing our work. You will see...In a year, perhaps less than a year, they will all be taking their orders from us. First, brother rat, you take a few orders from me. Get 'em up. We're gonna let the cops in on some of your bright ideas. Thank you. But for the present I would rather keep my ideas to myself. Listen, buster, you ain't got no secrets from me. I just took a quick tour through your tunnel of love. Looks like the number one office of Hitler and company. You're comin' along, too, sister. You realize you will never get out of here. Every entrance is guarded. Aw, don't try that line on me, Jack. This is Broadway, not Berlin. It's a great pity, Mr. Donahue, that you and I should oppose each other. We have so much in common. Yeah? How's that? You are a man of action. You take what you want, and so do we. You have no respect for democracy. Neither do we. It's clear we should be allies. It's clear you are screwy. I been a registered democrat ever since I could vote. I may not be model citizen number one, but I pay my taxes, wait for traffic lights, and buy 24 tickets regular to the policeman's ball. Brother, don't get me mixed up in no league that rubs out innocent little bakers and-- [gunshot] Excellent. Did you learn that in one of your gang wars? No, that's a little trick I picked up from Benny's shooting gallery in coney island. And if you don't quit stalling, I'll show you some other tricks I learned in Brooklyn. Well, Leda, it's useless to argue with such determination. Gloves: Hey, where you going, buster? For my hat, if you don't object. You make another false start like that, you won't have a head to put it on. Get those hands up. A smart character, ain't you? All right, go ahead. Get your hat. Thank you. [Speaking German] [Alarm rings] What's that? There'll be a dozen men up here in a moment. You'll never get out. You think so? Come on! Please, Gloves, listen to me! Please let me explain! You can't talk your way out of this one, sister. I know all about you now. Sunshine! Sunshine! Hey, Gloves! In here! [Gunshots] This place will be a shooting gallery in 2 minutes. Yeah, and we'll be the Clay pigeons. [Speaking German] Where do you think you're going, baby? Gloves, please let me go. I helped you before, didn't I? Now you've got to help me. Get out of here, but let me stay, please-- get out of my way. Listen, sister, I don't know what you're up to, but out there, the cops are waiting for me with a one-way ticket to the hot seat. You know who killed Joe Denning, and you know who killed Miller, and you know what's going on around here. You're exhibit "a," and you're coming with me. Hey, Gloves... This way out! Hey, Barney! Barney! Where have you been? You don't know what I been going through! We're coming down! This is no time for foolish questions, but how? Down that latticework over there. All right, start climbing, sister. No, Gloves, I won't do it. Now, you're getting to be an awful nuisance. Give her the old one-two. I hate to do this. Ha ha! Glass jaw. Be careful, now. Watch your step! [Speaking German] That's too slow for me. Why don't you stay in your own backyard? Hey! Who is this? My alibi. How do you do? Hey, drive me to the 47th street precinct. That's a police station! I know it. Hey! Wait for Tarzan! Hey! What'll I do? Let go, you dope! [Speaking German] I don't often slug a lady, but you gave me the cue. I shouldn't have expected any better. If you only had kept out of this. You've messed up everything. Yeah, I'm ashamed of myself. [Speaking German] Hey! Them weenies are tagging us. Hit it up, Barney. I'm racing now. Well, cut through the park. Right. [Speaking German] Gloves: Stall them as long as you can. Ebbing! Come on, sister. Ha ha! Hey, no, wait-- Ebbing! Ebbing! Ebbing! Leda: Ebbing! [Speaking German] Say, what are you trying to do, break your neck? I suppose you're sorry I didn't. If you try that again, then maybe I'll do it for you. Come on. Get on your feet. Pepi! What are you standing here for? Oh, we'll never find them. They are gone. We must find them. I can't go any further. Oh, yes, you can. Some night you're giving me, sister. I start out the evening with a nice poker game in view and wind up in central park playing cowboys and Indians. I don't know where I am. How about that? Me, in the middle of New York City, lost in the woods. Well, come on. Sit down in there and keep quiet. Will you please try and listen? You start talking about Joe Denning and Miller and that bunch of fancy killers you run around with, and I'll listen. Otherwise, shut up. But you don't understand. I hate them just as much as you do. You think I work for them because I want to? It's because I have to. Oh, don't give me that. This is a free country. Nobody has to do anything they don't want to do. Please let me explain. Listen, sister, I'm a busy man. If I can get out of this blitzkrieg, I'm going to turn you over to the cops and you can do all your explaining to them. You can't do that. Someone's life depends on it. You said it, sister--mine. No. My father's. Your father? What's he got to do with it? They're holding him in a concentration camp in Germany. Unless I keep on working with Ebbing, they'll kill him. Wait a minute... Where's this place, d-a-c-h-a-u? Dachau--that's where they're holding him. What do you know about it? [Branches rustle] [Click] Stay over there. Gloves. You're looking for me, I suppose. Yeah. I thought you'd run out on me. There's no need for that now. Tough luck, kid. I'll do whatever you say. OK. Sit down here, kid. [Ring ring] Hello, Westmore hotel-- oh, good evening. Give me a room, curly. With or without? It don't make any difference. Any kind. Boy. For me and the lady. And who might that be? My mother. Have you got any baggage? No. Well, I'm sorry, but I can't give you a room without baggage. I-- give me that key. Call up the cops and tell them you got Gloves Donahue up in room 214. Who? Gloves Donahue! I'm a murderer, a killer. There's my picture-- one of my best. Come on, kid. There's a 10 grand reward out for me. You'll never have another chance like this till you pick the winner in the Irish sweepstakes. We'll walk. Operator, give me the police, quick! This ain't exactly in my line, playing nursemaid. Feeling better? Thanks. Aw, now, come on. Cut that out, now. Here. Here, have a cigarette. Sorry about tonight, kid. Sorry you had to go through all this. It wasn't your fault, Gloves. Well, I wish you could have found out about your old man in some easier way. Quite a shock, wasn't it? It's all right. Just as well. It's better for him this way. Sure it is. It's better for you, too. At least they can't kick you around any longer. How'd you ever get tied up with them in the first place? I came here 2 years ago. Ebbing found out I was in New York and gave me the choice-- my services or my father's life. Nice characters. What were you supposed to do? Meet important people, try and get information. That's why I was at the club. I knew you was OK the first time I talked to you tonight. Like my old lady says, "I had a feeling." Then, as the evening wore on, I got a little mixed up. When I caught that conversation between you and the head man, well, I...I guess I blew my topper. Now, you were saying that Miller and Joe were bumped off by the same guy. Who was it? Pepi. Pepi? That squirt? What'd he have against Miller? They were working together, weren't they? No. Miller was working under pressure, too. They must have asked him to do something, and he refused. Oh, I see. Well, we'll get that Pepi. We got a special little gadget up in sing sing that'll just melt him away. It isn't only Pepi, Gloves. There are hundreds of them in New York, in every city of the country. They get around, don't they. I was glancing through this book. What's in there is nothing compared to what they're going to do tonight. They're planning something much more serious than anything they've ever done before. Yeah? That's what Miller wanted to talk to me about, and that's what I was trying to find out from Ebbing when you came into the room. Holy smoke. Haven't you got any idea what it's all about? No, but I do know that there's a meeting at 3:00 at the antique shop, and they're expecting 2 munition experts from Detroit. How about that? Munition experts, huh? You say their meeting's at 3:00? Yes. Well, we'll bust that up. [Knock on door] Man: Open up! Police. All right, you tell the cops everything you told me. That'll even up the score for both of us. Come in, boys. Am I glad to see you. All right, kitty, get your coat on. We're getting out of here with an escort. Ebbing: Good evening. To quote you, Mr. Donahue, "get them up." You're like a bad penny. Are you all right, Leda? Yes. Good. He won't annoy you any longer. Can I go now? Yes. Yes...I know. I'm sorry, but your father was an enemy of the state. That's no excuse for murder. I'm afraid you will be of no further use to us. Take them both. If you please, Mr. Donahue. Ok, buster. It looks like it's your pot. Mm-hmm. You mind if I check out? Keep quiet. [Sirens approach] Hiya, boys! Now I want you to meet some friends of mine. You're just in time, boys. I got a little something for you. Good evening, officer. Mr. Donahue tried to escape, but we managed to keep him. Good night. Thanks, Buddy-- hey, you! Come back here! Don't let them get away with that! They're spies! They're fifth columnists! Yeah, and I'm Hitler. But I'm telling you, you dope, don't let them get away with it! Gloves: Remember that explosion in the powder plant last week and that fire in the shipyard a month ago? This outfit's back of all that, and that antique joint's the front for the whole works. You take my breath away. Now, why don't you start your story with "once upon a time"... Now, stop kidding around, will you, Forbes? I'm giving it to you straight. It's all down in that book I was telling you about. Oh, yes, the book. We mustn't forget the book. He's right, lieutenant. You've got to believe us. All I want to know is who killed Joe Denning? A goggle-eyed little rat named Pepi, and he's the guy that got Miller, too. You're making a very naughty boy out of this Pepi. What I don't understand is, what is the connection between Joe Denning and Miller? I told you 50 times. I don't grasp it. Maybe I'm not big enough mentally. Listen, if you don't quit munching that sandwich and throw that feeble brain of yours into high gear, those guys are going to hijack the statue of Liberty. Come on, will you, Forbes? I'll show you their hangout. Ok, I'm no prude. I'd like to see this den of bogeymen. Now, don't let anyone take that sandwich. And that goes for you, too. What are you going in this way for? They got a trick entrance around in the back through the warehouse. I like to be conventional. Let's go in the front way. You might just as well have phoned and told him you were coming. Listen, Gloves, I'm a simple man. I can only digest one hunk of bunk at a time. Yeah, well, you'll change your mind when you get inside. It's possible I could be convinced. Well, here we go. Well? Open up. What do you want? What do I want? What do I look like? Open up. Yes, sir. Don't worry, boys. They told me there'd be nights like this. All right. The main office is right down this hall. This'll open up your eyes. You're scaring me. Sounds like the next installment of superman. My kids will enjoy this. How about this? Very convincing. Yeah, but... I don't get it. There was a bunch of desks in here, and a lot of maps on the wall, and-- and a shortwave radio over there, and a picture of what's-his-name, and-- maybe they're still here. Maybe we just can't see them. Aw, why don't you quit being funny. I saw them with my own eyes. Great evidence. An invisible office. Hey, you... What became of all the stuff that was in here? I don't know what you're talking about. This has been a storeroom as long as I've been here. What are you trying to tell me? I was in here only an hour ago and I-- don't get excited, Gloves. Take it easy. Yeah, but this guy's one of them, too. How long you been working here? Oh, 5 or 6 years. He's lying. I've never seen him here before. Anything been moved out of this room tonight? Not that I know of. The gentleman must have another place in mind. No, I haven't got any other place in mind-- now, Gloves, the good little fairy won't like it. Gloves, the elevator-- they must have moved all the stuff into the warehouse. The elevator, that's it. I forgot all about that. Come on, boys. Right over here behind this wall. How do you get in there, baby? There's a switch over here. Now, you fellas better stand back. It opens out that way. Gloves, it's gone. What? There was a button releasing a spring. I think I have a clue, folks. Aladdin dropped in with his lamp, gave it a couple of rubs, and the whole thing disappeared. Now, you got to listen to me, Forbes-- I've been listening to you. Now you listen to me. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll all get on our magic carpet and get back to the station. We'll let the D.A. Unravel this in the morning. But tomorrow morning will be too late. We've got to find them tonight. He's telling you the truth, lieutenant. We've got to stop them tonight. I'm sorry, miss Hamilton. You're acting your part fine, but I'm a bad audience. Now, I'm booking you for murder, Gloves, and holding your girlfriend for further questioning. I'm telling you that behind that wall there's an elevator that leads to a warehouse in the next block. I've had enough of that-- elevators, radios, secret panels! I'm tired chasing butterflies! Ok, baby, I guess it's no dice. The lieutenant is losing his temper. I surrender, dear. Come on. Wait. What is it now? Leda... That curtain. Oh, the curtain! Of course! You gonna start that again? No...I think that's what I been looking for. What do you see? Nothing. See you later, baby! Forbes: Come back here, Gloves! Don't let him get away, boys! Go get him! You can't get away with this, Gloves! [Gunshots] [Pounding on door] Come back, Gloves, or I'll shoot. Sunshine: Hello, hello? Yeah. Let me talk to Benny. Here you are, sunshine. Hello, Benny? You seen anything of Gloves tonight? Yeah, we know the cops are looking for him. Keeps your lamps open, and if you see him, we're waiting at Spats' place. Can I use the phone, please? Go away. What about yip's place? I called him. No soap. I'll try the golden rule. Can't I please phone Annabelle? Hey, what's eating you? I'm worried about my honeymoon. I just got married tonight. So what? Gloves might be lying in an alley with a knife in his back. You ought to be worrying about him, not your honeymoon. Can't I worry about them both? Ah, the line's busy. Can I use the phone, please, can I, huh? All right, call her, but make it a quickie. Well, what do we do now? The best thing for Gloves to do is to get on a plane and go as far as it'll take him. What kind of a mouthpiece are you? You're making a convict out of him before they convict him! Hey, don't you start complaining. You're the guy that got him mixed up in this thing from the first. Who me? Yeah, you! I told you, we were at the ball game this afternoon when his old lady called up and told us about that Miller's cheesecake-- if I hear that story again, I'll go nuts. Wait a minute. Hey, fellas, please. I'm trying to converse with Annabelle. Converse, converse! Don't get sore, Annabelle. I can't help it. I'm lonesome, too. I'm doing the very best I can. I'm only human, after all. I'm at Spats' place, honest I am! I'm waiting here for Gloves! Tell her, will you, fellas? Forget her! I'll get you another dame. Annabelle, I don't want another dame. No, I don't love Gloves more than I love you. Please tell her, will you, fellas-- hang up, stupid! No, Annabelle-- Anna-- all right, she hung up. Now you see what you've done? She's going to divorce me and name Gloves as corespondent. Don't worry, junior. You need the experience. But I haven't had any experience! Sunshine: Hey, Spats! What's the matter? Quick! Give a look! Sunshine: Callahan and his boys are downstairs. Uh-oh. We're wasting our time, boys. Gloves will never pass through that picket line. He'll show. I'll sign an affidavit. Hey, fellas, what about these cowboys? I can't hold on to them much longer. If I have to listen to that song once more, I'll shoot them both. And I'll bury them. Do me a favor. Let them go. What about the poker game? Forget it. What? Forget 20 grand? Gloves is in a jam, and that dough will buy a lot of writs of surceasement and habeas corpuses, ipso facto. Hey, that's good. You take them over. I'm running out of double-talk. All right, come on. Cowboys: * home, home on the range * there they are. * where the deer and the antelope play * how you doing, boys? I'll tell you, partner, I'm getting mighty weary waiting for this here Mr. Donahue. Me, too! I'm all for hitting the trail back to the motel. Come on! Now, now, now... Wait a minute, buck. It's like I told you. Mr. Donahue's delayed, but he'll be up here any minute now, right, Starchy? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Keep your spurs on. After all, you can't expect pyramid aldatia for Benson all the time. Lay off that gab, will you? Come on, come on there, Barney. Cheer up the boys. Let's whoop it up, wranglers! All: * home, home on the range * [knock on door] * where the deer and the antelope play * come right in. Come right in. Hello, Barney. Mrs. Donahue, what are you doing here? Well, I been looking for Gloves, and I can't find him. I been to his apartment and down to his office, and I thought maybe he might be here. He just stepped out for a little air. He'll be right back. Oh. Why don't you come on in? Sit down. There's a nice chair. You know the boys, don't you? Good evening, mother! Hello, ma. How are you, Mrs. Donahue? Barney, I'm that worried about Gloves. It says here in the paper that he killed somebody. Oh, they're just trying to build up circulation. Exactly! Well, I don't understand it. Now, when I come in here a little while ago, there was Callahan and his boys downstairs, and they tried to search me! What?! They can't do that without a search warrant. Say, mother, how about a little drink, huh? Fix you a nice little glass of Sherry. Oh, no, thank you, Barney, but I wouldn't mind a little bit of bicarbonate. Oh, yes. Bicarbonate. I'll get it. [All talking] [Rustle, thud] Gloves! Hey, fellas, it's Gloves! It's Gloves, fellas, it's Gloves! Hey, Marty. Now, don't start shooting. Let me get my mitts on him first. Gloves: So I do a beautiful swan dive... Quiet. Into the east river. They don't follow because they figure I'm at the bottom. And that's the story up to now. What's the idea, Callahan? Shut up! You've got no right to break in here like this, you big-- keep out of this, Spats! This is illegal entry! Gloves has got a date with the hot seat, and I'm going to see that he keeps it. Son! It's ok, mom. Marty, you got me figured all wrong. I didn't kill Joe, but I know who did-- Pepi, your piano player. Don't try to tell me-- that grease ball is part of a mob that makes you and me look like little Bo-peep, and they been using your joint to do their finagling in. When did you dream that up? Sunshine: That's no dream. Gloves is referring to certain parties from across the pond. Yeah. Tracking down this Hamilton doll, I uncovered a nest of fifth columnists, fivers, spies to you. Pepi was one of them. That's what Joe found out, and that's why Pepi knocked him off. Well, if that's on the level, what are you telling me for? Why don't you spill it to the cops? I tried to, but no soap. Now, listen, Marty. I know you're no mental giant, but try to juggle this, all of you. I got a firsthand report tonight on what it's like on the other side, from that Hamilton babe, and brother, I'm telling you, we got to watch our steps. Those babies are strictly no good from way down deep. They're no bunch of petty racketeers trying to muscle in on some small territory. They want to move in wholesale, take over the whole country. So what? It don't make no difference to me who runs the country as long as they stay out of my way. That's just it. They're not going to stay out of your way. Oh, yes, they will. Aw, now, listen, big shot, they'll tell you what time you get up in the morning and what time you go to bed at night. They'll tell you what you eat, what kind of clothes you can wear, what you drink. They'll even tell you the morning paper you can read. They can't do that. It's against the law. Yes, it's unconstitutional. How do we know you ain't making this up? Why don't you read the papers? It's on the front page every day. Every order that Berlin dishes out, these babies follow through. Up to now, we've had only the preliminaries, but tonight's the main bout. We got to find out what it is and stop it quick, and I need your help. What do you say? Ok, count us in. Good. Give me that coat. Cowboy: I'll help you track down them coyotes, partner. I tackled them in 1918, and I ain't afraid to tackle them now. Me, too. They going to make a warmonger out of me yet. The first one of those guys I tag, I'm going to kick him right in the swastika. Callahan: Where do we go? That's what I got to find out. Spats, you round up everybody we know. Barney and sunshine, you come with me. I'll call you back in a few minutes. Mrs. Donahue: Be careful, son! Where are we going to look for these lugs, coach? You said the antique joint was cleared out. That's right, but the kid will know. They got her in the 47th street police station. They'll grab you if you get within a mile of a police station. Don't you worry about that. Sunshine's doing all the interviewing. Annabelle! Barney! Darling! I haven't seen you for so long, I didn't know you-- good-bye. Where are you going now? Please try to understand, dear. It's a national emergency. It can't wait! Well, neither can I! Miss Hamilton? Yes? Ok, sister, get your things. You're leaving us. Leaving? Yeah, you been sprung. A friend of yours just bailed you out. Oh. Mr. Donahue? I don't know, lady. I just work here. Come on. Get your coat. All right, miss Hamilton, you can go now, but understand you must stay within the jurisdiction of the court and be available when called. Yes, sir. Your friends are waiting outside. Thank you. Make it quick, sunshine. Keep the motor hot. Hello, beautiful. Jail is no place for a nice girl like you. Hey, Gloves! They got the dame in that car. What are you talking about? They sprung her, the fivers. Get in. Let's go. They've went like magic. Maybe they ducked around the corner. No, they didn't have time. We were too close behind them. They're somewheres in this block. Look. "Kassler rippchen eisbein saurbraten mit--" what does that mean, coach? It means we're in the right neighborhood. Oh. Wouldn't it be better if we just sent an anonymous letter to the g-men, huh? Hey, wait a minute. Coach...Look. Where have I seen that face before? "Madison novelty company." Doesn't that ring a bell? Yeah. "I.J. Madison and company" on the sign at the warehouse. Boys, we're on the right track. Hey, wait a minute. There's the car. That's it, all right. Yeah, that's the car, but where are the people? [Vehicle approaches] Say, this might be a lead. Duck out of sight. I wish I was at 42nd street. Why 42nd street? So I could catch a subway home. Quiet. Hey, Barney, tell Marty and Spats to hotfoot it down here with the interference. What about you fellas? You can't impersonate them two guys. We can try. Go on. Beat it. Good luck. Don't forget us. Heil Hitler. Heil. Heil. Your cards. Cards? Identification. Welcome to New York. This way, gentlemen. Schroeder und holzmeir. [Crowd murmuring] [Rap rap] Ebbing: Quiet! We were forced to meet here because of an indiscretion of one of our agents. Nevertheless, we will proceed with our operations according to plan. I cannot impress upon you too strongly the importance of tonight's task. Our success depends upon the precision with which each man carries out his assignment. What we have done up to now is only the beginning of our campaign. We have laid the groundwork for their disruption and disintegration, but now we must destroy their confidence. And we can only accomplish this by an action as daring and as bold as the one planned for tonight. We must not fail. All: Sieg heil! Sieg heil. Now...The vessel will sail at 4:27. It will proceed from the Brooklyn Navy yard, at a speed of 4 knots, to a point in the narrows opposite fort Henry. What vessel is he talking about? Quiet. At this point, the speed increases from 4 to 9 knots. And according to our plan, the vessel will reach the minefield at approximately 5:15. Excuse me, Herr Ebbing. Yes, doctor? 5:21, to be exact. Based on the coast guard tide reports, it is a mathematical certainty that, barring unforeseen events, we can hardly be a second off. Thank you, doctor. So the vessel will reach the minefield at 5:21 exactly. Steindorff, check the reports. I'll be back in a minute. What's up? I don't know, but I got an idea that somewheres off there, we'll find the kid. Quiet! Quiet, please. Lichdich. Hier. Your report please, Herr Lichdich. Arrangements have been made to control any interference from harbor traffic on the Staten island side. 5 men will be on the dock, one man in each car on the ferry. And 3 sailors have already been stationed in 3 various positions. Very good. Holzmeir. Herr Holzmeir. Herr holzmeir. [Whispering] What do we do now? Once this guy Holzmeir starts talking, we'll duck out that door. Ok. Holzmeir! Biller. Yes? Did Schroeder and Holzmeir arrive? Yes, they were admitted. [All murmuring] Herr Holzmeir. Hey, that's you. What? Oh. Ja? Are you Holzmeir? Ja. Didn't you hear me call your name? Well, yeah... I'm sorry. I was talking to my friend, uh... Schroeder. Herr Schroeder. Did Schiller take you to the docks tonight? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure, he took us to the docks. Good. Schroeder and Holzmeir have flown in from Detroit to help us. Your report, please. My report? Well, all I can say is it's a great pleasure to be here tonight to find out what you mugs--uh-- gentlemen have been doing in this part of the country. It's very enlightening, to say the least... Which reminds me of a story. Uh, many years ago-- we have no time for stories. Your report, please. The report. Well, if you don't mind, I'd rather wait till Ebbing gets back. [Speaking German] I don't get you. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, ok. What did you have reference to? Come forward, please. Uh-oh. [All murmuring] You and Schroeder are munition experts, are you not? Yeah, we--we know a little something about it. I was told you inspected the mines tonight. Oh, yes, yeah. We gave the mines the once-over. And what's your opinion? My opinion? Yes. Up here, please. Now speak up. Speak up. Well, uh... At the moment, things don't look so good. What do you mean? Well...These things take a little time to figure out. Have you got any ideas, Herr Schroeder? Who, me? Well, the way I figure it is, uh... Oh, yeah. The stratavan is on the paratoot right next to the mockters prockters. That is correct, Herr Schroeder. The stratavan is definitely on the paratoot right next to the mockters prockters and 100 feet deep. But according to my calculations, if we can just keep this up, we'll be ok, right? [Speaking mock German] And we must not fail! Heil! Heil! All: Sieg heil! I'm sorry, but all this seems rather confusing. Would you try to speak a little more distinctly? I said the stratavan is larasang tatavan Brooklyn Navy yard. Apparently this gentleman does not understand the technical terms used in our report. Never mind that. What about the mines? Oh, the mines? Oh, yes... Uh...Uh, the mines. Uh...Uh, what about the mines, Herr Schroeder? The mines? Well, what about the mines? Well, didn't you check the mines? Who, me? Well, uh... Oh, yeah! The kansanon is on the prossapoo, and the senapot will equalize the poopanick if the gradastan is on the altar. And we will win! Heil! Heil! All: Sieg heil! I'm sure you gentlemen know what you're talking about, but I must ask you to repeat the whole thing again, and this time, very slowly. The--the whole thing? Yes. He wants the whole thing. Well, I--I don't think that's going to be necessary. I think we have here what we have been looking for. It seems like we got a control station at rockaway point. Looks like we got another one on the bridge between Brooklyn and rockaway. Not only looks like it, we--we got one. And it looks like we got a little problem up here with the coast guard. Oh, we got a battleship in Brooklyn. Looks like we're planning to sink a United States battleship. [Speaking German] Gloves: Yeah, yeah, I know that. I just want to make sure. Ebbing: Did you tell the police there was a meeting here tonight? No. You are lying! I--I told them there was a meeting, but I didn't know where. Did Miller tell you about this place? No. She's still lying. I told you she and Miller were working against us, but you wouldn't listen to me. [Speaking German] What is it? "What is it?" Your friend Donahue is downstairs. Donahue? How did he get in? Well, how should I know? Why don't you ask beautiful? He's not only here, he's on a platform, speaking, and he knows everything. Madame: You fool. You've let a pretty little face destroy everything you've worked for. You silly, stupid, blundering old-- keep her here. Barney: Hey! Come on! Come on! [All talking] Barney: It's locked. Is there a lock-picker in the crowd? Callahan: Get in here! We'll go around it. Come on! Well...That's...That's about all I got to say. Everything's all set, and if things go according to plan... We can't miss. Ebbing: Thank you, Mr. Donahue. You caused me a great deal of trouble. This time I'll attend to you myself. Bring him upstairs. This one, too. Hey, take it easy, will you, fellas? I'm all run down. I'm taking pills right now. Here we are, Gloves! Ok, Barney! Heil! Heil. Ok. Heil? Heil. Uh-huh. Now sing! What do you want me to sing? God bless America! Heil! Heil! Fine. [Speaking German] What do you mean? They have broken up the meeting. Broke up the meeting? Who? Leda: I'll tell you-- the people. The people you despise so much. The people you said you would split into angry little groups. You can't beat them, Ebbing. You think not? Never. You're finished! You stay here! Ebbing: They haven't beaten me yet. Pepi, you come with me. But where are you going? We'll do it ourselves. What, the two of us alone, huh? Yes! But that's silly! I'm not going. What did you say? I'm not going. Suicide is not for me. Schweinhund. Leda! Leda, baby. Are you all right? Yes. Oh, that's fine. Now, listen, kid. We got them on the run. They won't bother you anymore. Where's Ebbing? I don't know. He was here a few minutes ago. Madame: I can tell you. You'll find him at the docks near the warehouse. Thanks for the tip, lady. I'll put in a plug for you. Coach! How'd it go? Coach! Everything all right? Yeah. Take Leda over to my joint and turn this dame over to the cops. With pleasure. So long, kid. [Motor idling] [Footsteps] I hope you find it interesting, Mr. Donahue. Drop your gun. Did you hear me? Drop it. Get your hands up. Pardon my curiosity, but what is all this? Explosives. High explosives, Mr. Donahue, for the newest American battleship. Looks like a little bit of flash Gordon, to me. You don't think you can sink one of them big boats all by yourself, do you? Why not? One man, if he's inspired, can change the world. Get into the boat. What for? Since you have been kind enough to follow me, I shall take advantage of your services. Get in. I could very easily kill you, Mr. Donahue. Don't tempt me. Take the wheel. And now you will see, Mr. Donahue, what kind of man the new order breeds. Get underway. You don't think I'm going to sit here and drive this canoe into one of our battle wagons, do you? If you make one false move, I'll kill you and take the wheel myself, so you might as well do as I say. Them boats ain't made out of tissue paper. Are you sure this stuff is going to work? Not even the steel plates of your battleships can withstand these new explosives. What do we do, dump this stuff over the side and run? There will be no time for that. What do you mean? We'll strike the ship the moment the explosion occurs. Yes, Mr. Donahue. In a few minutes, you and I and Hansel will die. You're not afraid to die, are you? I don't mind dying, but I hate to be divided up into small pieces. There she is. Now bear toward the center of the ship. Now faster! Brother, I hate to tell you, but you're nuts. You fool--it's our destiny to conquer, and no one can stop us. Go on! Faster now! Faster! Go on! Faster! Go on! Faster! Yes, Mr. mayor. Yes, sir. Donahue's in my office right now. He's ok. That motorboat smashed into a barge loaded with lumber, made toothpicks out of it. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Whatever you say, Mr. mayor. Yes, sir, you're right. That's what I been saying for years. We got to wake up. Yes, sir. I'll tell him right away. Yes, sir! What's up, Forbes? Yes, how about the D.A.? What's he going to say about this? Take it easy, boys. Take it easy. Come on. Break it up. Break it up. I've got a message for you, Mr. Donahue. Ok, sweetheart, spill it. The D.A. Says the charges against you and your girlfriend are dropped. The chief says you're a free man. And the mayor says as soon as he can find his fire helmet, he'll meet you at the city hall. Well, how about that. Looks like you're national hero number one, Gloves. Reporter: What's the next stop, Mr. Donahue? Are you invited to the white house? Second reporter: I hear you're going to work for the F.B.I.? Well, I'll tell you, boys-- how do you feel about this, miss Hamilton? Yes, let's hear your story. Well, I feel a little like the Princess who's been rescued from the dragon by the white knight. Aw, that's you, Gloves. You're the white knight. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Anybody that prints that can expect the usual trouble. What else? Go ahead. Well, I also feel it's about time someone knocked the axis back on its heels. Excuse me, baby. What she means is, it's about time somebody knocked those heels back on their axis. See you later, chief. Mom! Hello, son. Are you all right? Sure, I'm ok. Oh, something terrible's happened. Yeah? What is it now? 5 will get you 10 the milkman disappeared. How'd you know? Didn't I tell you? It's true. He didn't come home last night, and I'm afraid something's happened to him. Oh, what makes you think that? Well, son, I've got a feeling-- all: And when you've got a feeling, you've got a feeling. Captioning made possible by Warner bros.
