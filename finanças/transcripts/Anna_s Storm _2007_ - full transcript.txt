You answer your mother's letter yet? I haven't even opened it. It came a week ago. The last one came a year ago. Seth, I want you to open the letter. And I want you to write her back. Why? You worried she'll think you kept it from me? Because it's the right thing to do, that's why. I'm not writing her back. You're not going anywhere tonight until you do. I brought you a couple more boxes. I never fixed his closet door. If someone comes to see the house, the closet should have a door. Jack, you promised to box his stuff up. I'll get to it. The rummage sale is on sunday. I'll get to it. Don't rush me, Anna. I don't try to slow you down. Need some money for lunch? No. How about a ride to school? No. Emily... We're moving to Chicago. Hi, Mrs. B. Hello, Tyler. My mom and I are going camping this weekend. She bought me a new telescope for the trip. That's okay, Tyler. You can keep it. That way, you and your mom will each have one. No problem. We can share. I'll put it back if you want. I know where it goes. Hiya, doc. Hey, Tyler. I came by to return Ricky's telescope. My mom bought me a new one yesterday. So, my mom and I... Are headed up to Jasper lake this weekend. Going camping. I seem to remember franny chen and Emily skinny dipping in that lake. And I remember them coming out and reaching for their towels. And all of a sudden, this wind came up out of nowhere, and kept blowing those towels toward the woods. Mother nature... Only it wasn't the wind, was it, Tyler? It was fishing line... Fishing line being reeled in by a couple of boys who were laughing so hard, they blew their cover. Yeah. Well, you gotta admit, it was one of our best. See ya around, doc. Hey, Tyler. You want to stay for pancakes? I could whip up some batter. I'd love to, but I've got to get to school. See you. Bye, Mrs. B. Bye, Tyler. You men ready to make some noise? Grab a sign. Let's go. Here you go. Take that one. What's on the agenda, Marty? Word is, we're going to have trouble with public works. That was inevitable. I hear you. Cortez is back to complain about staff for the hospital. Paul Montana wants a fast track permit to cut down trees. Why does he think that he doesn't have to follow the same rules that everyone else has to follow? He's Paul Montana. And remind me why I took this job. Well, before you, your father was the mayor of cottonwood. And before him, your grandfather. So it's a defective gene. Yep. Something like that. Mayor Davenport, we lose one more nurse and we lose our accreditation. We've got to hire more staff. Good morning. Good morning. Morning, Anna! I've got all my paperwork in order... Geology study, environmental impact report. Now, if you just expedite my permit to clear trees on cedar slope, I might me able to open up three new lifts by the end of the season. Just what we need. More broken bones coming into the hospital. Gentlemen, you've come to the right place at the right time. Paul, you want your fast track permit to cut trees, you got it. Jason, you want more staff at the hospital, it's yours. 'Atta girl. How are you going to pay for the extra shifts, Anna? I'm not going to. Paul's is. Excuse me, now. One second, Anna. I am? Yes. By agreeing to a 10% surcharge on all lift tickets. Wait a minute. No way. The only reason people come here to ski is because it's still cheaper than Aspen and vail. Okay. We'll put it on the council's winter agenda and open it up for public comment. Well, that's just great. Then Millie wildflower and all her hippy friends will get up there and say what a horrible person I am for tearing down all the helpless trees. We'll go with the tax hike. 10% to the hospital. Good choice. Looks like you've got some fans. We've got a right to be here, sheriff. You've got a right to be 50 feet from city hall. Now move! Chief Corbin! What if he has an appointment with the mayor? They're too close to government buildings. That's the law. You know that, Anna. Well, if you back off, I'm sure they'd be happy to move down the street. You're still in charge. There you are. For you. Douglas, remember when you were in the fifth grade, and Mr. Hall made you clean up the entire school yard, because you put hot sauce in his coffee? I do. Well, that wasn't fair. We put you up to it. We should have all been punished. So you owe me one, is that it? Douglas, some things have slipped past me since Ricky's... death. Look, Anna, we're not pointing our signs at you. I know that. But the city council should've ratified your contract months ago. And I haven't done enough to help. Marty and I, we'll make them make good on their promise, if it's the last thing we do in my term. Your term or the next guy's, we can't go back to work until it's signed. We can't do it, Anna. All right, guys, make some noise! Empty promises, empty trucks, empty promises, empty trucks. Empty promises, empty trucks... Updating our top story... There are several meteorites hitting different parts of North America. One has just hit a gas field on the east coast, and another has just landed on the outskirts of Kansas. Martin Reese reporting from Kansas. So how're those new cookies selling for you, son? They're not. They're just sitting here turning to stone. I can't get 'em in fast enough. Guess they go better with coffee than with beer. Hey, listen, they're having a guest chef at the lodge on sunday night. Indian food. You want to come? You've never had saag paneer, have you? Invite me when they're serving prime rib. Where's your sense of adventure? Hello, Anna. Morning, Mr. Reed. Is Emily working for you this afternoon? Sure is. Good thing for me, too. The receipts always go up when she comes in. Missed a spot. You want to pitch in? Maybe, after my rounds. You make me nervous. You want to get started on the roll-ups? I'm talking to all the city council members. We have a problem, Dalton, and you know it. What, those public workers on strike? Hell, one afternoon in Denver, I could round up a dozen men who'd be happy to earn what we pay. We pay less than what we promised. You saw the budget, Anna. Big snows didn't happen last winter. Big tourism didn't either. Well, you managed to give yourselves a raise. First one in 10 years. Hey, folks, dj Dan here, and I have a confession to make. I consulted a vedic astrologer to find out if I should have eggs or oatmeal for breakfast this morning. She told me not only to skip breakfast but that I should stay in bed all day. Which is why I drove straight to work. Of course, then I heard a report of a meteorite hitting a gas field on the east coast. And I can see online that another one has just slammed into a farmhouse in Kansas. Maybe I should have stayed in bed after all. Which is faster, a bullet or a meteorite? Meteorite. Come on, em, what's your guess? Bullet. Meteorite wins, at... Seth! I told you. Which gives more warning? It's a meteorite. Bullet. You see the guy pull a gun. You hear the Sonic boom. Meteorite. You hear the Sonic boom. Go home and write fast. I'm not answering her. Gee, that's too bad. 'Cause if you don't finish the letter, we can't go out later, and it's my turn to pick the plan. Em, I don't know... I... It's okay to be nervous. I'm not nervous. I... Seth... We've got less than two months together. Don't you want to make the most of it? I'm gonna miss you so much. I think I can get off early. I'll call you later. Latte, extra foam. And a cookie monster. Double-latte, extra foam. And this is for you on the house. Enjoy. Whose house is it on? What, now you're giving away my cookies? Yep. And that's why they're buying a three-and-a-half-dollar latte here instead of a 99-cent cup of Joe at the diner. I knew there was a reason I hired you. Hi. Emily, we need to talk. Do I barge in on you at work? No, you don't. Then we'll talk at home. Emily, I want you to know why I took this job. What difference does it make? It's done, isn't it? Yes. You said we wouldn't move until I finished high school. That's all I wanted, mom. That's all I wanted. It's not only about what you want, Emily. Your father and I have decided. Dad doesn't want to move. Did you even ask him? He may not want to. But he needs to. We all need to. Do you have any idea how hard it is to lose a child? I feel him all around me... Tilting back in his chair at the breakfast table, just to tease me. On the front porch. On the sidewalks in town. It is so real. It is so painfully real, I can't stand to live here anymore. I feel him, too, mom. It's the best part of my day. Now, I am going to drop off the videos. You want to come? Okay. I will take that as a no. I'm also going to run into the market. Any requests? Maybe chocolate milk, chocolate cookies, chocolate almonds, chocolate kisses. Any reasonable requests? White chocolate, dark chocolate. Stay here. I'll be right back. These pictures are amazing, Anna. What a great historical record. They're a terrific contribution to the museum. It's so generous of you. But these are family treasures. Are you sure you want to leave them with me? I know you'll keep them safe. Look at those gams. What? Getting ready for your first press conference. Come on! I don't know how that one got in there. Listen, Anna, I want you to know I tried to talk Douglas out of this strike. To at least wait until you're out of office. But he can get real bullheaded sometimes. I hope he isn't making life too hard for you. Not at all, Miriam. He's just trying to make it better for you. I think it hit main street! Call the fire department! Help! Miriam! Help! Can you move at all? I can't. Okay, okay. You'll be okay. Okay... I have to leave you for just for a minute. I'm going to get help, okay? Help! Help! Anna! Anna! Douglas! What can I do? Miriam! Where's my wife? Janet, call 911. Get an ambulance and firefighters to the visitors center. Miriam's hurt. Okay. Okay, sweetheart, breathe. Just breathe. An ambulance is on its way. Anna, are you okay? I'm fine. The paramedics are on their way in. Call Jason at the hospital, warn him we've got injured coming in. Get Clint Corbin over here. And try to reach tad wingate at emergency response in Denver. My god! Tyler! He's in the back! I can't get him from here! Give me that! Step back, step back! Marty, help me roll him over. Marty, support his spine. Now, you start to pull him out. I'll take his legs so we can get him out faster. I got him, I got him. Gently... gently. Tyler. It's okay. It's okay, Tyler. Grab his legs. I'm right here, I'm right here. One, two... three! Come on, Tyler. Okay... Is he okay? Watch his head. Is he okay? We've got a pulse. He's breathing. We have got to get him to the hospital now. It's going to be okay. We've got a little boy over here. He inhaled a lot of smoke. This is his mother, Janet. Carl! Anna, there have been many strikes... Small fires on all sides of town. Several houses are now threatened. But I only have so many fire trucks. We have to make some fast choices. You have to leave the truck here. We have to protect the town. No. You get this one under control, and leave a skeleton crew, and get your trucks across town. This place is going to go up. We have to put our resources into saving people's homes first. Listen up, chance of plans. We're going to redirect... Did the hospital get hit? Hey, you've reached Emily's cell. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. Emily, it's mom. I just wanted to make sure that you're okay. Please call me when you get this. I love you. It's Jason Cortez. Jason, it's Anna. We've got injured coming in, two critical, and I don't know how many others. Right by the front door. Anna, we've got word of several hits in town. Call in everyone from every shift. Get a hold of Kevin Simon and Dina McCoy. Tell them they're not retired anymore. We need more than nurses, Anna. We need doctors who have worked in e.R.S. All right, hand on a sec'. Listen, I'll deal with you in a second. Listen, I'm handling a situation right now. Thank you, Marty. Jack, they're going to need help in the E.R. I'm not even on staff anymore. It doesn't matter, this is an emergency. I hear the new doctor's very well trained. The new doctor is one person. Anna, I haven't treated any patients in half a year. Ricky's death was not your fault. I don't know that. Maybe it was something I did or didn't do. You want to look for blame? Well, then, why don't you start with the driver of the truck? He was the one who didn't like the song on his radio, so he took his eyes off the road so he could change the station. Or how about the owner of the minimart, where he got his coffee that morning. Maybe he watered it down. Or what about me? I was the one that wouldn't let Ricky out of the house until he double knotted his laces. That took 20 seconds, Jack... 20 seconds he could have used to get across the road. There are people who are hurt right now, who might die, if you don't walk back into the E.R. and help them. Tyler is one of them. Who do you think Ricky would want treating his best friend? What is going on here? I told you to prep warm saline dressing and start an I.V. Line. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but family waits out front. And let's get some meds on board. And why didn't anyone tell me this man's not responding to the atropine? Give him another milligram. Doc! Doc, you gotta help my wife. She was in the explosion. She's lost a lot of blood, and she says she's dizzy, too. It's all right. Excuse me. Where is the pain? It's in my stomach. The side. Do you feel nauseous? Okay, nurse, take her to bed four. Type and cross and do an ultrasound of her abdomen. And please start an I.V. Sir, you have to wait out front. No, I'm going to stay with her. Sir, you want to do what's best for your wife, you wait out front. Where is Dr. Coleman? Isn't he scheduled for a shift right now? Dr. Coleman lives in Boulder. He's been called in to the trauma center there. And you are... Dr. Baxter, this is Dr. Ryan. Dr. Baxter used to work here in E.R. Great, it's about time I had some back-up. Look, I haven't seen half these people yet. Why don't you take burn and pulmonary. I'll handle cardiac, trauma and lacerations. So what've we got? It's good to see you, Jack. Right over here. It's a meteor storm, Anna. We've had hits in six counties in Colorado alone. What caused it? Hard to say. Meteors are flying around US all the time. They just don't usually get close enough to be sucked in by the earth's gravity. Why didn't they burn up in the atmosphere? Same reason the shuttle doesn't burn up on its way home. Speed. And the iron content of these stones. They're mostly metal. They come in like cluster bombs. With no warning? NASA tracks only 7% of near-earth objects. These are part of the 93% they don't. Is it over? No, Anna. It's just beginning. An alert's been issued across the entire western United States for the next three hours. What am I supposed to do? What's protocol for a meteor storm? Activate your disaster plan. Already did that. Tell people to stay indoors, away from windows. And? Hope it passes you by. Tyler's on 100% O2 and O2 sat is at 92. He has partial thickness burns on his right arm, several lacerations on his chest. B.p.'s 90 over 60. Do you know this boy? He was my son's best friend. He should be my patient, then. No. He's going to be mine. Morphine's not holding. Up him to 1 milligram. Maintain O2-7 94%. Hey, Tyler, it's doc. You're in the emergency room. It's going to be okay. I'm going to take care of you. Come on, Emily. Answer the phone, honey. Answer the phone. Hey, you've reached Emily's cell... Your wife has a ruptured spleen. We're giving her blood to stabilize her. Just tell me when I can see her. Well, the plan is to transport her to Boulder for surgery. When can I see her? You can see her right now. She's in the room back there. That's all I want. And could I have a coffee... Black this time, please. Hey. Hi, baby. How are you? Listen, you remember, you said you wanted to get out of town for a couple of days? Looks like you're getting a free trip to Boulder. We'll have to see how he responds. And Miriam? She needs blood, but she's o-negative. We only have two units on hand. Well, how long will it last? Couple hours at best. My god! Anna, we need a helicopter. Jason's gotten nowhere. Can you work on that for me? Of course. Could somebody get Marty in here for me? Have you heard from Emily? No, I just get her voicemail. Why won't she answer? I don't know. Maybe her phone's off. Don't worry about her. As long as she's at the cafe, she's in the safest place in town. Hope street hasn't been hit, right? Tyler. Stat. I've got to go. Anna, what do you need? We've got to find a medivac. I'm on it. What's his sat? 57. He's getting airway edema from the heat and smoke. I'll call rt stat. Get him on a vent. And get an abg. Yes, sir. My god. I understand that you are in the middle of an emergency, and so are we, and we need a helicopter. Well, can't you take more than one patient? We are trying flight for life. The mayor is on the phone with them right now. We are right on your way. Breath sounds are equal. Secure. Order a chest X-ray for placement stat. He's good. Hi. Your double-shot Espresso, sir. And I forgot your napkin. Get away from the window! Hello? Hello? Hello? Vents down. Geez. Everyone, listen to me, please. It's very important... I need a pen light. Top drawer. Other side. The hospital has a back-up generator. And a bag. I've got it. Marty, my cell is out. We've got to try to reach Bob hanson, find out how extensive the outages are. Everyone else, we'll monitor channel 9, talk on 4. Pack up your laptops and join me at the hospital. They've got back-up power. We'll run our operations from there. Okay, vents working. Get him back on. Yes! Yes! Thank you, everyone. Any oxygen? What settings do you want? Let's just control it. Volume 350. Set it for 50. He did fine on the bag. He's breathing. It's working. How bad's your damage? From what we've been able to piece together, the damage is extensive. Main street is a war zone. Power plant's gone. It's horrible. How many times have you been hit? We've had multiple strikes. We've got no power, no phones. Anna, we just lost a 40-foot section of road across both lanes. And no way off this mountain. We just lost highway 40. What's your patient status at the E.R.? I've got two critical who are in need of transport, but I can't get anybody up here. Let me contact the air force bases, see if I can get you a chopper. Is there anything else I need to know? It isn't over, Anna. There's more coming. Jack! Where is she going? I'm sending her to Boulder by ambulance. She can't wait any longer. You can't. There's a piece of the highway missing. There's no way through. Everyone, listen up! We're about to get another wave of injured in. Where from? Hope street. Reed's underground cafe. Emily! Emily! You can't go this way, Anna. I have to. The front stairway has collapsed. Anna, you've got a chance over here, through the service entrance. The building was hit really hard, Anna. There's a lot of people trapped. Can we get them out? We're going to do our best. Here, Anna. Put this on. This way, Anna. We've got leaks in the gas main. When pockets of gas build up, anything can set them off... A spark, static electricity, even a cell phone. Is gas building up in the cafe? I don't know. We're going to put a sniffer down who can reach. There's a door around the corner, at the end of the hall. It leads to the back stairs, down to the cafe. If we can clear a path, we should be able to reach them. Emily's down there, isn't she? We'll do everything we can. I give you my word. Got a reading off the sniffer yet? Down this way. Here's where the stairs would be, but the upper floors collapsed. My god. Carl. Anna. Gas is seeping in. We're going to have to dig them out. We can't risk it. We can't. If we throw off one spark, and the whole place blows. And you know what happens to those people when the oxygen gets displaced? At 20% gas, they get dizzy. At 40%, they'll vomit. At 60%, they are dead. Can we shut off the flow to the neighborhood? All the shut-off valves are underground. I wouldn't know where to look. Who would? Public works. I don't understand. Why can't you do the surgery here? Because we're not surgeons. This isn't a trauma center. You've been saying that all afternoon. We don't have an O.R. or an anesthesiologist. Then you bring those people here. We can't. The roads are closed. There is no access. Look, we are still hoping for a helicopter. And where is it? Doug. Anna's working on it right now. Excuse me, I have another patient. Jack. I'll be right there. Be honest with me. Without surgery, she only has a couple of hours. So you're saying... That if I have something to say to her, I need to say it now? Miriam. Douglas. Can we help you, chief? Can I talk to you for a minute? Miriam is injured. This is not a good time. We've got a big problem. There's a gas leak in town. Well, I'm sure the fire department can figure out how to shut off a valve. It's a main valve that's leaking. Douglas. I'm not on duty. I'm afraid you're going to have to be. People's lives are at stake. Would you step outside, please, sheriff? I will not leave my wife. You don't have a choice. Put him in the Van. Don't touch me! Don't take another step. Clint! Anna, let me handle this. He's refusing to safeguard the public in a crisis. You activated the security plan. You ought to know its provisions. Stop. Clint, I want you to leave the hospital. I want to talk to Douglas alone. I will handle this. It doesn't look good, Anna. If we don't get her off this mountain... I know. I've got Marty and Jason working on a medivac. Douglas, I am so sorry about the timing of this, but I need you to come to the cafe and turn off the gas. You can't ask me to leave my wife to go help people who wouldn't help me. I'm not asking you to help them. There are other people who are trapped down there, and they're running out of time. Emily one of them? Douglas... Hey, baby. I'm right here. I'm right here. Douglas, go. There are six regulator stations for the town. The one that handles this area is right here. It's Chestnut street. Now, to shut this sector off from inside the station takes electricity. Can we bring in a generator? No. Not with unmapped leaks in the line. It's just not safe. So I got to get down to the manual shut-off valve down in the sewer. Once I cut the flow, we'll need to burn off whatever gas is left in the line, so any businesses that are supplied at 2 p.S.I. And above, they should turn their gas on full. That's the bakery, the diner and the lodge. What if we get everyone in the area to burn off gas? That's a good idea. We could get into that cafe faster. Let's go. Carl, I'm in. Over. It's going up too fast, Carl. How much longer can they be down there? We've got about 10 minutes. Carl, can you hear me? Yeah. Douglas. Douglas. Do you copy? Roger. Carl, I'm at 60%. Roger that. I got you, I got you. I'm at 70% now, Carl. It's climbing fast. 75. Still going up. Why is he moving so slowly? He's got to, Anna. If he creates one spark, he blows up the whole place. We broke 85. Douglas, what's your 20? I can see it. I can see the valve, Carl. Doug, you all right? I'm fine. I'm fine. The valve is off. Repeat, the valve is off. Tell your men to move, Carl. Okay. The main is off. Go ahead and burn out the system. Carl! Is it dropping? Take a look. It's falling. Men, let's get ready to go. It's at 10. Okay, men, let's move it! Any word on Emily? No. And your father hasn't come up either. It'll be okay. They're both going to be okay. Dad! I got him, I got him. He's going to be okay. He'll be all right. Come on, dad. Sit down here. Here you go. I'll come to the hospital. Douglas. You did the right thing coming down here today. Now it's our turn. Here's your contract. We all signed it, every last one of US. We all want to say we're sorry. I personally want to say thanks. Anna. Are you looking for Emily? Yes. Where is she? She asked for the afternoon off. It was slow, so I let her go. Go? Go where? I don't know. I'm sorry. I can't move it. Use your legs. Come on if a meteorite can knock down a tree, you should be able to push it with your legs. It won't budge. Emily, in my trunk, there's a crowbar. Go grab it. Okay. Wait, wait, wait... Keys, keys, keys. I got it! Use it as a wedge right there. Pry it in... Ready... One, two... Three! I don't think it's going to move. Try it again. Try it again! Hang on. Hang on, I got an idea. Where are you going? Okay, okay... Okay, I'm going to tie the rope... Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'll tie it around the tree... I'm going to loop around that branch right there, and then I'm going to tie the other end to your car. I'll back it up, and you'll be able to slide out. How are you going to back up? What do you mean? Release the brake and put it in reverse. You can't drive, Emily. How hard can it be? My car's a stick. I understand that we're in a disaster here, but your nurses can't even get a proper set of vitals. How am I supposed to do my job if they can't do theirs? We're all under a lot of stress here, doctor. You know what... Just have all the vitals rechecked. And make sure they're done right. This town's just a pit stop for you, isn't it, Dr. Ryan? Excuse me? In for a few years, spend some time on the slopes, then out you go? But for the rest of US, this is home. We were born here, we raised our families here. Sometimes, we Bury our children here. So when we come to work at this hospital, it's with mutual respect. Natalie Darwin has 32 years' experience in emergency medicine. Sandy's been an aide for 17. Dina and Kevin had over 40 years between them before they retired. And Laura... Laura hasn't missed a single day in 37 years. That's over a hundred years experience, doctor. I've found that to be a good number in a crisis. You got it? Yeah. Yeah, I got it. That's not reverse. Yeah. No kidding. Put the clutch to the floor and shove the stick all the way to the right. Right. Clutch in. Now ease on the gas as you ease off the clutch. Ease on the gas. Ease off the clutch. Come on. Got it? Keep it going! Seth, are you okay? The key word was "ease." Just try again. Okay. Ease on the gas, ease on the clutch. That's it. Keep it going. That's it! Keep it going! Keep it going! You piece of crap! Well, that's useful. Insult my car. Seth, tell me you're okay! I'm okay. Seth, I think I figured out what the problem is. The tires are slipping because there's too much snow here. Use the crowbar to chip away at the ice. You know, Seth, coming up here to be alone with you at your grandpa's trailer... This is not how I thought this day was going to go! Actually, em, it wasn't going to go how you thought anyway. What? I wasn't going to go through with it. I wasn't going to sleep with you. Why not? Because you said yes for all the wrong reasons. Why was today going to be the day? Because you found out you were going to move? You had a fight with your mom? When we sleep together... I want it to be about US. Jack, what is it? What's going on? Jack! Let me go! Tyler's going to be okay. What is he doing? I need an 18-Gauge needle right now and set me up for a chest tube. He's got a tension pneumo. If we don't get the air out now, we're going to lose him. He's stable, Janet. His lung collapsed, but we got it reinflated. I've upped him 2 milligrams morphine, so he's comfortable. He's going to pull through this, Jack, isn't he? He inhaled a lot of smoke. Until he's breathing on his own again and his oxygen levels come up, I can't be sure. He needs some time on the ventilator. He had his heart so set on that camping trip. Every day, he would pull out the book with the trees and the birds, a map to the sky, you know that one with the little wheel? He got that from Ricky, a love of the sky. God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jack. I wanted to be strong, I did. I can't lose him, Jack, I just can't. How do you survive the loss of a child? I don't know. I don't know if you ever do. I haven't. I think a part of you never does. The rest of you just keeps limping along day after day. When Ricky died, I didn't know what to do or say to help you and Anna. Really? You were the first one to come over and the last one to leave every night. You answered the phone for US when we couldn't. When people started flooding in, you made sure there was coffee on the stove. Emily was never alone. You brought US meals every day. My casseroles! God, they're awful. Well... No, it's true. They are. Tyler hates them. Hey, we ate 'em and we were grateful. Jack... Please just tell me when this nightmare's going to be over. I can't. You have to be hopeful, Janet. Tyler needs you to be hopeful. That's your job, okay? Okay. This is mayor Anna Davenport, talking to you from our emergency broadcast station, kcxn 1610 radio. At 4:15 this afternoon, our town was hit by a shower of small meteorites. Less than an hour later, more rocks fell. The damage has been severe but localized. Both the power plant has been hit, knocking out most of the electricity in the county. We've got a broken water main and are being advised to boil water before drinking it, or just drink bottled water until further notice. There have been some casualties and many injuries. Dr. Ryan and Dr. Baxter are at the hospital, treating patients, but they need blood... Every type and a lot of it. So if you can, please come in and give. For those of you who cannot stay in your homes, or don't want to be alone, we're setting up a temporary shelter at the cottonwood community church. Millie wildflower will be coordinating efforts there. For those of you who are afraid that more rocks may fall and are thinking about getting out of town, well, that's no longer possible. One of the impacts took out a piece of highway 40 about six miles down the mountain. Even if you could get off the mountain, it wouldn't keep you safe. There have been reports of rocks falling all over Colorado, with an alert for continued activity in the sky. So what are we left to do? Where do we turn when we cannot run? I hope to each other. Don't wait to hear from me. Look in on your neighbor. Share whatever food and water you have. It comes from the Bible: "Two are better than one, "for if they fall, one will lift the other up. And a three-fold rope is not easily broken." We are a town of 1900. We are not easily broken either. Seth? Seth? There is one last thing I'd like to say. Seth? I'm the mayor of cottonwood, but I'm also a mother. Emily, wherever you are, please, keep yourself safe. Please, sweetie, be safe. My daughter, Emily, is missing. If anyone knows where she is, please come to the hospital and let US know. And, em, if you can hear me, I love you. And I will find you. All the way to the right... Ease off the clutch. Keep it going. That's it. Okay, that's it. I'm out! Emily! Emily! Emily! Emily! Seth! Em... Seth, I did it. I got you out! God. No! My god, I'm so sorry. Better? Yes. How's his blood gas? His c-o-2 is 49 and his p-h is 7-3-2. Natalie, can you resecure his e.T. Tube? Yes, doctor. I'm thinking of upping his vent rate. Yeah. I wouldn't recommend that. Why not? Well, he's already had a tension pneumo. A slightly low o-2 level won't kill him, but if we blow out his other lung... I'd leave his airway pressure down. When I was at sc, I was working on a study on permissive hypocapnia in kids with chest trauma. There were many fewer lung complications. Why haven't I seen this study? It's still underway, hasn't been published yet. Look, I know it goes against your gut. It went against mine, too, until I saw the early results. But it's what Tyler needs. How long have you been out of residency, doctor? Three years. Why? You know when I said a hundred years experience can be a helpful number? Three can be helpful, too. Let's do it. Thank you for coming. What are you doing here? You asked the citizens of this town to give blood. I'm here to give blood. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have had my back up. Around me, you always seem to. Franny? Are you okay? I'm fine, Mrs. Baxter. Do you know where Emily is? She left work early. Why? Where was she going? She didn't say. She didn't say. They didn't say. She was with Seth. You scan. I'll drive. What? I put a tracking device on Seth's car. Makes it easy to keep tabs on a teenage boy. Isn't that invasion of privacy? You want to question me about the way I raise my kid, or you want to find yours? What button do I push? I'm getting a reading. Show me. They're at my dad's trailer. We'll be there in 10 minutes. Are these things expensive? I need you to start the car. Okay. Now, I need you to shift while I call out the gears. You ready? Put her into first. That's third. Back to the left and up. Good. Now to second. All right, here we go. First. Second. Third! Okay, second. Back to second. Why wouldn't they have called? A cell doesn't get reception up here. They'd need to have a radio. They must have know that something's happening. They would have tried to get back to town. Maybe they thought it was safer up here. Maybe they tried to get back and they couldn't. They've had an accident. Or they've been struck by rocks. Would you keep those thoughts to yourself? Why is it our kids can't stand to be apart, and we can't stand to be together? We've never even had a civil conversation. What do you want to talk about? Well, did Seth say anything this morning? We had some words. Not about Emily. About his mother. I didn't know Molly very well. We were always friendly when we saw each other in town. I know. I never really understood why she left. I know that, too. She said she didn't want to live in a small town the rest of her life. Called it provincial. Hopeless. She didn't think about her son who had his friends here. Or the husband with a job here. I don't begrudge her her ambition. I just wish she'd... Told me before we had Seth. So did Emily say anything to you? Nothing. She wouldn't even speak to me. She's so angry because I want to move, too. Sometimes I wonder what kind of mother I've been to her. We may not agree on much of anything, Anna, but my son should've been so lucky as to have a mother like you. It's making a sound. It's okay. He's coming down the mountain. We're on the same road as they are. Third. Seth, look out! Something wrong. I've lost the signal. Seth? Emily? Seth! Emily! Seth! Seth! Emily... Easy now. It'll be okay. I got you. I got you. Come on, come on, come on. It's okay. I've got you. He sounds sounds clear. He's at full saturation. Jack. Emily's hurt. She's going to need you to be her dad, not her doctor. Emily. Baby. She been in an accident. It's going to be all right. Dr. Ryan here's going to stitch you up. Doctor. Why not you? 'Cause if screwed up. You'd never forgive me. You'll be all right, sweetie. It'll be okay. Go with her. Seth. Can you walk? Okay. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. Is it just your head? I'll hold it steady. Hop right up there. Good girl! Okay. You're going to be fine, sweetheart. How's Tyler? He's okay for now. Let's sit down. Did you write that letter? Excuse me? I asked you to write a letter to your mother. Your only son is nearly killed, and all you can think about is did I write that letter? So did you? Yeah, I wrote her a letter. Did you mail it? No. Thought you might like to read it first. That's none of my business. Dad, I want you to know how I feel about her. I want you to know what it says. Why? Because we should know that about each other, shouldn't we? Do you still love her? Yes, I do. Would you take her back? No, I wouldn't. Do you love her? She hasn't earned that. Would you give her a chance to? Yeah, I would. Well, good. We both know how we feel about your mom now. Put a stamp on that envelope, seal it shut and mail it. Yes, sir. I'll get you another ice pack. Doctor, we've got a problem. Bed 4's coding. We need the crash cart and a defibrilator now. Find Doug. Keep him in the waiting room. I'm seeing cardiac arrest. I got nothing. Start cpr. Anna, it's tad. Can you hear me? Anna? Mom. She not responding. Anna, I want you to listen to me. The rocks that have been falling over the last few hours, we now know that they're debris from a single larger meteor heading our way. Your way or mine? The computer models put impact in eastern routt county, just north of highway 40. In other words, mine. What's going to happen? As it hits the atmosphere, you're going to hear a tremendous Sonic boom, louder than any you've heard so far. The sky above you will turn blindingly bright. And then? Listen, I'm not gonna kid you, Anna, if it hits, it's like an atomic bomb going off, total devastation at impact site, with significant damage up to 500 miles away. What do you mean "if it hits?" It's theoretically possible that a big rock like this could blow apart from all the friction it causes as it goes through the atmosphere... If the composition is just right. Has that ever happened? Once, or at least we think so. In 1908, a big meteorite about this size was coming in over Siberia. Seconds before it should've hit the ground, it just blew apart in the sky. How much time is there? Projected impact is in 45 minutes. You know we have no road out of here, tad. I've contacted general Wade at northcom. I put in a request for as many choppers as they can spare. A request? There are 1900 people in cottonwood, Anna. There are tens of thousands more in towns all across the rockies. There just aren't enough helicopters. And there's not enough time. I'm sorry. Do you believe in prayer, tad? I believe in science. But sometimes I hedge my bets. Well, hedge one for US, will you? I'm so sorry. We did everything we could, but... Would you like me to take you in? Anna... There's another one coming. Bigger than all the others. If it gets through, no one will survive. I can't do this anymore. I can't fix it. I can't help the people of this town. I... I can't even reassure them. That's what I thought until you led me back here. I'll have no regrets about today, because I know I did everything that I could. And that's because of you. There are certain things that can't be put in a box and made all better. Ricky's one of them. Now Miriam is. And what might happen in that sky tonight is another. For the last six months you've been turning away from me. Away from Emily. Away from everybody else in this town. You have 45 minutes, Anna. What are you going to do with them? We can break in in a moment, Anna. I'll give you a cue. Okay, Anna, you're on the air. This is mayor Anna Davenport. I've just spoken to the Colorado center for emergency response. The latest report from NASA shows a large meteor headed for possible impact with earth. There is some hope that it will explode in the atmosphere. But if it doesn't, tracking has it making landfall somewhere between the eastern rockies and western Colorado. The center of that radius is right here in cottonwood. The estimated time of impact is in 35 minutes. As your mayor, it is my duty to give you this information, but there is no time or means to flee. There is only time to reflect on how you want to spend this next half hour. Some of you may want to spend it alone, others with your family. I want to spend it with my husband, and my daughter, and the rest of my family... The people of this town. I'm going now to the cottonwood community church. I hope those of you who want to will join me there. I have to stay. I know. Anna... Do you remember when Ricky was four, and he learned how to snap his fingers? He was so proud of himself. And he didn't just snap them, he flicked his wrist like he was throwing dice. He made up a game about it. "Mad mommy," he called it. I would have to pretend to be mad at him. "Ricky, you'd better clean up those toys right now..." Then he'd snap his fingers and I'd have to be nice. Thank you for Ricky. And thank you for Emily. Emily, I'm really sorry about this morning. It's okay, mom. I just wanted so much to stay. To hold on to this place. To Ricky. And to Seth. You really like him, don't you? Yeah. I do. I should have listened to you more. I should have talked to you more. What's going to happen tonight? We're going to be together. Marty, what's wrong? What's happening? Schriever air force base is sending a chopper. It's on its way here now. One chopper? How many does it hold? It's an h-60. The pilot plus 10. 10? You're telling me we can only save 10 people? If it helps, I took a head count. How many children? 18 and under? Yes. More than 10. There you go. 16 and under. It's too many. I'm not going. Marty, 16 and under? How many? 13, Anna. Mom, I said I'm not going. You are going to get on that helicopter. Somehow, you are going to get on that helicopter. There isn't enough room. Emily, I want you to survive. Mom, it's okay. I'm not afraid. It's okay, mom. How far is schriever from here? 50 miles. It'll be here. Just keep watching the sky. Anna? Tad, what's happening? General Wade issued a calldown of all his craft. They're needed in the regions where more people live. More people? Or more important people? I'm sorry, Anna. I'm so sorry. It's okay, Tyler. I'm right here. You're in the hospital, Tyler. And Jack is taking care of you. You've got a tube in your mouth, so you can't talk now, Tyler, but you're going to be just fine. Tyler, I've been here the whole time. And I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to leave your side. You should go. Go be with your family. I'll cover here. What should we do now? Where should we go? I think our odds of surviving are better if we split up. If we all huddle here and the church gets hit, who's going to make it out of here alive? If we fan out as far as we can, we'll have a better chance of survival. Do you really want to survive if the people you love don't? I know I wouldn't. Neither would I. And I do believe, if we stand together, these moments will have meaning. Emily. Too bad Ricky's not around to snap his fingers? Maybe he is, baby. Maybe he is. Seth... You've been an angel, Marty. I'm so sorry about Miriam. Thank you. Mom? Emily? Emily! God. My god. Hey. Hey. Good morning, folks, dj Dan here again. I have another confession to make. I fired my vedic astrologer. She tried to tell me not to vote in today's election for our new mayor. She said I should embrace whatever fate comes and live my life in sync with the stars. I say she's a nut. I'm voting. Because I'm a free-willed man, and I make my own fate. And so should you. Are you hungry? Yeah. Can I get you anything else? No, I'm great. Thanks. If this threesome's at my doorstep, there must be trouble. We don't have any troubles, do we, Millie? The three of US are getting along just fine. Then why are you here? Well, Anna, it's customary for the losing candidate to call the winner and offer congratulations, but under the current circumstances, we thought a face-to-face visit was in order. So, who's conceding to whom? We are. To you. To me? Marty won 2% of the vote on a write-in. Millie won 12%. And I won 26%. The other 60% voted for you. Great job! Congratulations, Anna. You did it. What's going on out here? Your mother just got re-elected. She did? Well, what do you say? Are we moving to Chicago? You want to help me take down that sign? Okay... On three. Okay. One, two, three!
