[BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DIALING TONE] Hi, yeah, I'm not here. You know the routine. I'll get back to you. Hey, Kelly, Norman. Haven't heard from you in a while. I got something that concerns you. It's big. Hey, meet me at the mall by the phones tomorrow, 12:30. It's numbers. Hey, I got no time to explain. I'll see you there tomorrow, 12:30. [MUSIC PLAYING] VIVIAN: Hey, Stevie, it's me. I don't want anything. I don't just call when I want something. No, I've got a surprise for you. You have a date. Oh, come on. Don't be that way. She's a really nice girl. You said yourself if I set this up for you, that you would go. So I set it up. Today at Cottonwood. Oh, yeah. Her name is Sandy, and she'll be waiting for you by the phones. She's going to wear slacks and a sweater and have a red scarf tied around her neck. Uh-uh, hang on. Kids, come on. Move it. Breakfast. She is a real looker, little brother. You're going to have a great time. She'll know you. Ah, yes, that's perfect. OK, all right. I'll let her know. Bye bye. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: You know what she's going to be don't you? STEVE HITCHCOCK: What. - A whale. (LAUGHS) You don't know that. Besides, Aunt Vivian said that we'd be surprised. Oh, I'm planning on it. Do you remember the last one? Brunswick was afraid to sit next to her. (LAUGHS) You and mom should have stayed together. It wasn't my idea, remember? Why did you bring Brunswick? Our code won't work without an excuse. I got him trained to do a sick act. Huh, Brunswick? [DOG YELPING] He doesn't look sick. Hungry, yes. Sick, no. You see, I can hypnotize him. Kevin, nobody can hypnotize a dog. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: That's what's so cool about it. I got the program off the internet. And all you have to do is tie a treat to a string, and make him watch it. Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. You're going to make him neurotic. We'll have to take him to a shrink instead of a vet. Now, when you want to ditch her, just ask me about the vet appointment for Brunswick. Right? With my luck, she'll probably think it's for me. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Back and forth. You're feeling sick. It'll pass. Deal, you open. Oh, no. I don't want to play dumb luck with you anymore, Kevin. As a matter of fact, you shouldn't be gambling at all. It's not real gambling. Then how come I keep losing money? OK, hang on. Full house. I got four of a kind. Four of a kind? Put up or pull out. You want to see them? Cost you double. RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO): The entire state is yielding to Lotto fever. That's because the Diamond Lotto total is up to $29 million with one more day before the drawing tomorrow night. $29 million. RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO): Following the lottery-- Well. RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO): Lieutenant governor Blaine Mitchell will-- What? Four nines. Fork it over. Yeah. My son, Amarillo Slim. [MUSIC PLAYING] Dad, the ticket to the Powerball game. Yes, I will get the Powerball game. For grandma. [MUSIC PLAYING] You try the Lotto game, kid. Best pick's menu. Loads in all the winning numbers of the year so far. Program factors them in. Very sweet. Cool, so did you win with it? No. Well, what would you pick? All the small numbers. How small? Under ten. These things are expensive. You got to spend some to make some. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SHOUTING] Just ditch her now. Do you think I want your Aunt Vivian all-- Excuse me. He's probably a shoplifter. You think. Cool. That guy was big. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Awesome. [MUSIC PLAYING] There is a kid and his father right up there with a shopping bag. The kid has got it. I will give you a call. You just get that bag. Get the-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Dad, she's a babe. She's not wearing a red scarf though. So? Just go say hi. Hi. Sorry we're late. You are? Vivian is pretty intense when it comes to matchmaking, isn't she? She is. I-- I usually don't go for blind dates, I mean. But she's-- she's very, very persistent. You know Vivian. I know Vivian. Sandy, right? Again, I'm sorry that we're late. We did some shopping. Me too. Time kind of got away from us. I'm Steve Hitchcock. This is my son Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Hey. Hi. I'm Sandy. Would you like some lunch? Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stop running. You stay still. You don't move. Where is it? Where's what? Wrong answer, Byers. Computer theft is a felony. You got the wrong guy. No, that's the wrong story, bub. We want those numbers. Would you like dessert? Yeah. - Ladies first. - No, thank you. It was wonderful though. Hey, I see you've been shopping. Yep, always spend more than I should. I know about that. Dad, you forgot this. Thing's still hot. So, dad, I think we'd better get going. We still have that appointment for Brunswick, remember? It'll wait. We have to take our dog to the psychiatrist. No, the vet for his shots. Well, if you have to go, I understand. No, no, it's fine. The dog is fine. Really. Why don't you go check on him? (SIGHS) I really enjoyed our lunch. I'm glad. I did too. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey. Get him. Stop running away from me. This guy, he's done for. At least I don't have to chase him anymore. KELLY JORDAN: I've got to make a call to the office. Would you excuse me? OK, thanks. Here, let me help you with the-- I think that one's mine. You're right it is yours. They look the same. They do. Just like high school. You took shopping bags in high school? No, Mary Kate Eaton and I, we had the same backpacks, and we were always getting them mixed up. And I was always taking hers by mistake, you know. Probably more interesting than me. Well, I think you're very interesting. So you didn't tell me what you do. I'm a partner in a CPA firm. You're an accountant. Yes, very spine-tingling stuff. No, that's what I studied in college. Accounting. - Really? Yeah, I think it's great when numbers can add up exactly. I agree, and then not many do these days. I know, there are a lot of really bad numbers out there. And I've met most of them. No, I think I may have cornered bad ledger market. Well, maybe we could compare ledgers one day. I'd like that. You know what? I really have to make that call to the office. Excuse me. OK. So she dump you all ready? No, she didn't dump me already. She's making a phone call. You like her? No, I don't think she's your type. (LAUGHS) Well, how do you know what my type is? Like interested in you at least. She happens to be interested in my ledgers. And I think she likes me. Yeah, right. She's going to give you the big dumpola, dad. Dumpola? Where do you get this stuff from? I've been around. You'll see. Can-- check, please. $18 for two cheeseburgers and a salad. Is that right? Yes. You've been stood up. We've been held up. This place is expensive. So where is she? I don't know. Maybe she thought we had to go to the vet or something. Maybe she had to go to the vet. Here's your card, sir. Thank you. Can you grab the bag, Kevin, please? Ah, dad, it's not there. WAITER: Thanks. What do you mean it's not there? A whole dollar. Thanks. Excuse me, did you find a shopping bag? I wasn't looking for a shopping bag. It was right here. It was-- It was a mall shopping bag. Apparently it's disappeared. Yeah, like your personality. Now how can you win the lottery. I need that game. I need my underwear. [MUSIC PLAYING] You've reached the Norman Byers summer home. Some are here. Some are not. Leave a message. I'll get back. Hey, Norman. What am I supposed to be looking for? I'm your friend not your psychic. Call me back. Come on, Brunswick. Come on, boy. Come on, Brunswick. Let's go. She's probably running that floating crap game again. Maybe she's doing laundry. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Grandma doesn't do laundry, dad. She takes that all to Mrs. Feldstein, and she beats her at Pinochle every Wednesday. Laundry is the payoff. Hey, Emma. Oh, hello Steven. Hello, Kevin. Brunswick too. How are you boys doing today? We're doing OK. Is my mom in her room? Oh, I believe she's in the recreation room. Bingo today. Oh, right. Bingo. What was I thinking? Thanks. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] MINNIE HITCHCOCK: I17, you got that? I17. What? I17, Bert. Please turn up your damn hearing aid. Hi. - Hi, mom. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Who's winning, grandma? I am. Hi, honey. Number B8. That's B8. Those old coots, they take forever to read their card. (LAUGHS) Well? Well, what? What do you want? I don't want anything. You never visit unless you want something. Yeah, turn the thing. N16. That's not true. MINNIE HITCHCOCK: N16. STEVE HITCHCOCK: N16. I said I would visit you, and I'm visiting you. Bingo. I got a bingo. (LAUGHS) You can't have a bingo, Bert. I just pulled four numbers. Nobody gets a bingo in four. Let me see that. Let me have a look at that. Oh, you don't have bingo, you old fart. Now, turn up your hearing aid, and turn on your brains, sweet thing. How much you making, grandma? Two bucks a card. And three games in an afternoon. That's not bad. Mom, they're going to ask you to move again. You can't run bingo for a profit in this state. Oh, who says I'm making a profit? STEVE HITCHCOCK: You're not? No. Mom, can we go someplace just to talk for a little while. Sure. After my game. Two bucks for Kevin's card. Did you get those numbers for me? The lottery numbers? I can't. Dad lost the computer program at the mall. Way to go. STEVE HITCHCOCK: I didn't lose it. Kevin was carrying it. Not me. No, I gave it to you. Don't you remember? STEVE HITCHCOCK: No, you didn't. You were carrying it. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Then I gave it back to you. STEVE HITCHCOCK: No. - Yeah. STEVE HITCHCOCK: You were carrying it. Ah, and this is the family I'm going to leave my fortune to. (LAUGHS) What fortune? The rigged deck of cards and an illegal bingo game. Dad lost his shorts. Dad never could bluff. In the bag, mom. I bought them this afternoon. Dad had a blind date today, and I think she's a hustler. She's not a hustler. Yes, she is. Yes, a blind date, hmm? She's very nice, mom. Yeah, well, the last time you had a blind date with a very nice woman, you married her. Mom, every time I come here do you have to open up this can of worms? Please, we mutually agreed to divorce. End of story. I'd love happy endings. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Grandma, I can hypnotize Brunswick now. Watch this. What is that? You're getting sleep. Oh, come on. We have to go. It's my turn for Friday night poker. Goodbye. - Oh, I love you. Goodbye. You need anything? Just a nice, warm, rich stud. I'll see what I can do. Bye, grandma. Love you. I love you too. Don't forget the numbers. I won't. I think I got a good tip this morning. See you. Come on, Brunswick. [MUSIC PLAYING] SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE: Substantial head injury. There is a chance he may not recover consciousness. Well, keep a man there anyway. You got it. Did he talk to anyone at the mall? SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE: Ah, we haven't determined that yet. Determine it. Why not just go into mainframe and change numbers all over? Byers eliminated the backdoor password. It would take months to make that kind of change. Now, we have to find the numbers that he substituted. Did you find anything on him? Ah, regular stuff. No numbers though. How about his apartment? Couldn't find anything that looked like it. Mall security camera? Doing that next. You don't have much time. Right. [MUSIC PLAYING] I need a rundown on somebody, Elgin. And I need it tomorrow. Cost you more. Greasing palms is getting expensive, especially on short notice. Who? Steven Hitchcock. That's what I got so far. How come you're having me do it? I can't use my usual sources. There may be leaks. This guy part of it. That's what I'm paying you to find out. Track down Norman for me too, OK? He's disappeared. More like dropped off a building. Computer geeks live in another world. Well, I'll pay you double when you get me the information. Hey, what if this guy's under cover or something? I don't think so. He's got good eyes. So does a Cocker Spaniel. Don't mean it won't pee on your carpet. Gee, I think I'll write that down. Elgin, I need this tomorrow, OK? It doesn't do me any good after that. I ever not come through? I'll know this guy's underwear size before I'm done. I already know that. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: You are dead. [DOG WHIMPERING] Come on, Brunswick, concentrate. When I say poker, you play dead. Poker. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Anything that eats like him can't be dead. Poker, Brunswick. He's almost got it, dad. Once he gets it, he'll eat it. Like this. Come one. Try it, Brunswick. OK. [CHATTER] KEVIN HITCHCOCK: I raise. ARNIE: No, no, no, no, no. You've got to ante up first. Then you look at your cards. Then you can raise. I knew that. I ante. - One game, and that's it. - Ah, come on, man. Let the kid play. - No. LINCOLN: Come on, he's going to need to know this before he gets in to college. That's how I paid for my tuition. And a few other things. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. OK, you bet? Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Fifty cents. In. ARNIE: Fifty. He says, I call. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: I call. Call, OK. Cards, gentlemen. Hmm, um, one. One for the Lincoln continental. LINCOLN: That's right, thank you. Chandler? Four. Good hand. Huh, Chandler? CHANDLER: Don't start. [LAUGHTER] How many, Arnie? Two. And you, my son? Ah, no cards. What? STEVE HITCHCOCK: No cards for Kevin, the young man. OK, dealer take-- You too short to be bluffing, buddy. ARNIE: So Stevie, any new women on the docket lately? No, not really. Well, he did have a blind date today. Hey, hey, hey. A real babe. CHANDLER: In today's rather crass ridiculous, that means you're going to score soon. Not in front of the young boy, OK? I meant that in the sporting definition in a sense. I know what he means. Jeez, I'm not a kid. You're not an adult either. OK, you in? You bet? LINCOLN: Yeah, hold on. STEVE HITCHCOCK: That's you. There you go. ARNIE: Come on, come on. I call. I'm going to raise fifty. Raise fifty? I'm out. LINCOLN: This kid's a shark. But you know what? I know a bluff when I see one. And I know you bluffing. I'll call you. I'm in. There you go. No. No. Too rich for me. I got bupkis. Truth time, Kevin my man. Just me and you. What you got? I got two pair. Jack's high. That's a good hand. LINCOLN: What's up? Big time. I got a big hand. Pay me. ARNIE: Do us a favor. Teach him a lesson. I'll take the little kid's money. No problem. - What do you have? - Three of a kind. STEVE HITCHCOCK: What? KEVIN HITCHCOCK: All babes. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Whoa. All babes. This kid is cleaning us out. Where did you learn that? Learn what? That lying with your eyes. ARNIE: You got some kind of a system, Kevin? [INTERPOSING VOICES] I'm not even that skilled at this particular game of chance. You ain't skilled at nothing except macrame. CHANDLER: I thought you liked those plant hangers. No system. I just like poker. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG WHIMPERING] CHANDLER: Well, Mr Poker, your deal. Oh, wait a minute. Now he's dealing. He's dealing. Wait, wait, wait. I don't think I can afford his deal. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Ante up. What game is it? Five-card stud. Nothing wild. Oh, hey. You take credit cards? No. LINCOLN: What? No. Well, I know your dad does. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Hey, give me another card. Yeah, I do take-- Yeah. Ah, I think he has a machine upstairs. [MUSIC PLAYING] Norman, what was it? Actually, this is how your apartment usually looks. [SIRENS] [INTERPOSING VOICES] LINCOLN: Impossible flush. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Two bets. LINCOLN: Me, I'll bet fifty cents. Fifty cents. Hello? Hi, Kevin. It's Sandy. Is your dad there? Yeah, one sec. Hey, dad. Dad. Yeah. It's the babe. ALL: Oh. ARNIE: Score. Go, go. Do you love her? [CHEERING] Um, Sandy? KELLY JORDAN (OVER PHONE): Hi, Steve. Listen, I'm so sorry. I'm calling to apologize for leaving like I did this afternoon. I just, I had an emergency at work, and I hope you understand. Oh, I understand. OK, listen, it's the silliest thing. But I somehow picked up both bags this afternoon. I was wondering if maybe I could come by and drop one off. Now? Yeah, if it's not too much trouble. I tried to get it in the glass. I have some people over. Can we-- can we do it tomorrow? OK, well, you know, it would only take a second. I'll just-- I just drop it by the door and go. Well, OK. KELLY JORDAN (OVER PHONE): So say then twenty minutes. OK, twenty minutes. Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] She knows Byers. Her name is Jordan. Oh, here comes the fax. She's auditor for AG's office. How would an auditor know what to look for? You think she's the one calling the shots? Who did she just call? Yeah, I have the number. Let me run through Ma Bell. Good game, everybody. Good game. What are you talking about? - Yeah, why we got to leave? Hey Stevie, how come we don't get to see her too? Look, I hardly know her myself, Arnie. OK? - Ah, come on. Kevin, all of it. - Hey, look, kid. You're a shark. But you got these cards marked, didn't you? No, it's just you guys do stuff when you have a good hand. That's all. Like what? Where are my donuts? They're in the kitchen. I need a drink. Well, you always hum Oh Wisconsin, and Arnie eats more. How could you possibly know all that stuff? Yeah. And you always push your glasses up and smile. STEVE HITCHCOCK: OK, guys. Let's grab a coat and go. I told you, see. This kid's a natural at it. I'm telling you. - Here we go. Just for the record, my donuts were not in the kitchen. How many kids do you know can spot all that? [INTERPOSING VOICES] ARNIE: I think maybe Chinese would be good. How about-- How about hotdogs? [DOG BARKING] STEVE HITCHCOCK: Hey. (WHISTLES) Inside. ARNIE: Come on, let's get some hotdogs. Do you really think Sandy took our bag by mistake? Yeah, sure. Why not? Come on, Kevin. Help me clean this up, will you? It just doesn't make sense. Two shopping bags? [DOORBELL RINGING] Here, come on. Come on. Finish the table. Hi. Hi. I'm so sorry about this. Oh, that's-- that's fine. It's OK. I just hate intruding on your evening. No, you're not. The poker game is over. - OK. Come on in. It's just me, Kevin, and Brunswick. KELLY JORDAN: Hi Kevin. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hey, that's the guy from the mall. What the hell? Was he working for her too? This is queer as a Chinese battle flag. No offense. Well, that's OK. I'm Japanese. Besides, you're right. The Chinese, they have weird flag anyway. Right. How could you pick up two shopping bags? STEVE HITCHCOCK: So you picked up our bag by mistake? Yes, I did. I'm sorry. You know, I really enjoyed our abbreviated lunch. And I just wanted to come over here and thank you personally. You're welcome. I was hoping that maybe we could do it again sometime. My treat. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah, sure. I'd like that. Can I take your coat? Sure. - Hello? - Oh, hey, Kevvy. How are you going? Oh, hi, Aunt Vivian. VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): Ah, listen. Let me talk to you dad for a second. The stand up artist. - OK. Can I get you something-- Dad, it's Aunt Vivian. Excuse me. Yeah, ah Viv, this is not a good time. VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): How could you, Steven? Sandy waited for you for over two hours. What? She's right-- VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): This is positively the last time I ever try to help you. Ever. Vivian, what are you talking about? She's right here. You can talk to her yourself. Hold on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Sandy? (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah. Oh, it doesn't sound like you. Do you have a cold? (COUGHS) I do. VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): Oh, honey. You gotta take care of yourself. I'm so glad the two of you finally got together. Listen, let me talk to Stevie a minute. (COUGHS) OK. See. VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): That is not Sandy. What? VIVIAN (OVER PHONE): I don't know that is. That's why I called, was to let you stew in your own juices. I was just with Sandy. I don't know who that is, but it's not her. If that's not Sandy, that could be some crazy, deranged lunatic. Oh, Stevie. Do you want me to call 911? No, no. That's all right. No, no, no that's-- that's quite all right. I can handle it. Bye. Well, listen. Kevin and I have to clean up, and it's getting kind of late. And you probably want to go. Well, that's the least I could do. Let me help you. No, no, no I don't want to keep you. Well, you can do my job if you want. Kevin. Come on, let me. So are you a get wet type or a stay dry type? Sorry? Wash or dry? I'll do it. So how did you get both of the bag at once? You know, it was the weirdest thing. It was just so light. It felt like one bag. So who won the big game tonight? Well, nobody thinks to dad. So Sandy is short for Sandra? Um, no. Kelly. Sandy short for Kelly. I should have told you this from the beginning. But Sandy is my roommate, and she was going to stand you up at the mall. And I was going to the mall anyway. And I figured I would tell you about it, you know. But you guys were just so nice. I couldn't. I didn't want to disappoint you. You know? So you came instead of your roommate so I wouldn't feel bad? Yeah. You're kidding. I know, it's insane, isn't it? I know. But Vivian was just so nice in setting it all up. I mean, I have to tell you though. She doesn't really know me very well. I mean, I don't get a chance to talk to her that much. Because every time she gets on the phone, she just talks, you know? Oh, that's Vivian. Her brain is like her purse. Never quite clicks. So Brunswick, how was poker? [DOG WHINING] KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Wow, it worked. Ah, he's not quite right. He needs help. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Dad, did you see that? Very impressive. You hear that? He's either not working with her, or they're both pros, and they're on to the surveillance. Oh, this guy's jacket's coming over. Who is he? Steven L Hitchcock. He's partner in CPA firm. You know this guy? STEVE HITCHCOCK: I can't believe that you did that. KELLY JORDAN: I know, I should've told you from the beginning. I just had such a good time having lunch with you guys. Ever been married? Kevin. No, that's a fair question. Not yet. - Why? You're not ugly. (LAUGHS) Thank you. I don't know. I was always afraid it wouldn't work out. Ours didn't. It's always better when families stay together, isn't it? Yeah. It must have been really hard for you guys. For both of you. Although I can't imagine why anybody would leave you. Really? I mean, we've managed. Yes, you have. Very well, I may add. So listen, did you check out what's inside this bag here. I'm so sorry. You know what, it can happen to anybody. I think it's all here. That's all we bought from the mall, right? Yeah, I know. I-- Yeah, this is what I got. Oh, you going to win the lottery? It's for my grandma. This computer program figures the highest probability on any lottery game. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Don't encourage him. He's plotting to take over the internet. (LAUGHS) How's it going to work on diamond lotto tomorrow? Good, well, I think. You load all the winning numbers on the year so far. And the program factors them in. KELLY JORDAN: Do you know I have a friend who says exactly the same thing. So I guess if everything is there then I should get going. Um, listen. Kevin has a game at the-- a soccer game at the local school tomorrow. Maybe we can do lunch afterwards? Yeah, I'd like that. It's my treat, remember? Yeah, OK. Ah, I can walk you out. OK. STEVE HITCHCOCK: You can-- I'll let you out, anyway. KELLY JORDAN: OK. Bye, Kevin. Bye. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Mr Hitchcock, this is Special Agent Osborne. State Department of public safety. We would like to speak with you this evening. Would that be possible? Is this about my mother? No, sir. Would it be convenient if we came over now? Well, yeah, I guess. But I'll want to see some identification. Thank you. We'll be right over. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] That was strange. [DOORBELL RINGING] Boy, you guys weren't kidding. I'm Special Agent Osborne. This is Special Agent Kurumada. May we come in? Yes, please. Didn't I see you at the mall? You feds? STEVE HITCHCOCK: Kevin, federal officers. State, son. Department of public safety. Excuse me. Right this way, gentlemen. We're conducting a fraud investigation. Do you know this man? No. Does this have something to do with the bingo game? Ah, no, sir. You were seen with a woman, an acquaintance of this man. Who is she? I'm not sure. She told me her name was Sandy. I don't know her last name. But then my sister told me that she wasn't Sandy. The real Sandy, I mean. The one I was supposed to meet. With my sister, it's hard to tell. Who called herself Sandy? Your sister? No, not my sister. She's Vivian. The woman who said she was Sandy who wasn't the real Sandy. Who is the real Sandy? I don't know. I never met her. SPECIAL AGENT KURUMADA: But you meet Sandy? STEVE HITCHCOCK: Not the real Sandy. The other Sandy. The woman who said her name wasn't Sandy was Kelly. She told me later. Her full name is Kelly Jordan. What do you know about her? Nothing. Just that she wasn't the blind date I was supposed to get. How do you know that? My sister. She said it up. And then Sandy told me she wasn't Sandy after all. Jordan works for the state attorney general's office. Does that mean anything to you? I just had lunch with this woman. We didn't exchange resumes. Mr Hitchcock, we'd like to enlist your cooperation. I can't tell you anything about a confidential operation. However, I do need your help. We want you to stay close to this woman. Get to know her. We think she may be making a move this weekend. Make a move? What does that mean? Will she be calling Mayflower? Sir, I'm not a pro at this kind of stuff. I'm just an accountant. You know, all we want you to do is just to call us if she does anything suspicious or out of the ordinary. Well, how would I know that? I don't know what she does in the ordinary. SPECIAL AGENT KURUMADA: When will you be seeing her again? After my soccer game. Call me at this number day or night. Anything may prove useful to us. Can you use one of your guys? I'll introduce him. She's made contact with you, Mr Hitchcock. May we see the shopping bag she took? Ah, yeah. Sure, Kevin, can you get the shopping bag? What-- what are you looking for? We'll I know it when we see it. Not here. Where is computer auto game? How do you know that we bought a lotto game? It's what we do. We find out things. The game? I took it out. I'll go get it. I have the receipt. Fine, fine. Don't take any chances. This woman is dangerous. Call us, day or night. It might be safer not to involve a minor. But I-- Thank you for your cooperation. Do you know who you got a date with? Hitler's girlfriend. That's not funny. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, I got you the stuff. This guy could be Billy Graham's nephew. I mean nothing. Partner in a CPA firm. Divorced. One child, Kevin. He has custody. Mother in a retirement center, which he pays for. Sister, Vivian, housewife. He works in various charities and donates time to be an assistant scoutmaster. Makes a nun look shady. This is nobody Norman knew. Did you know Norman was in the hospital? What? You think you hired an amateur. I seen it. - Yeah? Yeah. Norman, he had this in this stuff. Yeah, so? Norman, the original socialist. What's he doing with a campaign button? Look what somebody wrote on the back here. See? D, L. What's that? No idea. I got to see Norman. (LAUGHS) No way. I was lucky to get in. So I'm history. Money. Hey, I don't know what you're into, but something about this don't smell right. Oh, by the way. It's 32. 32. Yeah, his underwear size. (LAUGHS) [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Well, she doesn't work for the CIA. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Well, there's good news. How do you know? KEVIN HITCHCOCK: The web. You can check to see who works for them. Is there an arrest warrant on there for your grandmother? So you think she's a crook? Grandma? Yeah. No, Sandy or Kelly. Whatever her name is. She doesn't seem like a criminal. It doesn't matter. I don't want to find out. It's over. It's history. OK? Call you grandma. [DIALLING BEEPS] It's her machine. She's not there. Leave her a message. OK, grandma. Here are the numbers that I think you should play. 7, 0, 7, 8, 0, 8. Come on, you have to change. You got to get dressed. Bye. Don't forget your shoes. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, boy. Let's go, Brunswick. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Hi, may I help you? Yes, I'm looking for a colleague of mine. I thought he was working here at the campaign office. What's his name? Norman Byers. B, Y, E, R, S. Byers. No, sorry. No one by that name. Well, is there any way he could be working here and not be in that file? Well, he could have been a home solicitation volunteer. I see. What was your name again? Adel. Adel, well, who would be in charge of that, Adel. I would. But I don't have anyone by that name listed. Well, hey. You're looking at your newest volunteer. All right. Excuse me for a minute. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, Adel tells me we've got a new volunteer. Thank you. You are more than welcome, Mr Mitchell. Soon to be Governor Mitchell. Not everyone shares Adel's optimism I'm afraid. We really appreciate you helping out. Well, I was in the neighborhood. Spoken like a true volunteer. Have we met? You're not from this area are you? Austin, Texas. I'm Delores Beauregard. It is a real honor to meet you, sir. - Well, welcome aboard. - Thank you. Thank you. I'll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILDREN SHOUTING] CHILD 1: Let's go. CHILD 2: All right, come on. [WHISTLE BLOWING] [DOG BARKING] So you see her yet? No. Go on. They're waiting. Hi. Hey, where did you come from? Pittsburgh originally. Is that Kevin's team? Yes, can we talk for a minute? Sure. Listen, this-- this isn't working out. What? This-- this whole dating thing. It just generally doesn't work for me. Oh. It's not you. Well, actually it is you. Oh. Well, I'll just be going then. Tell Kevin I said goodbye. Wish him luck. Who are you? [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm somebody just like you. Not like me. I'm a CPA. I don't do exciting things. I make it a rule not to get involved in felony investigations. No, CPAs watch bottom lines and bank balances and take years to decide to change the color of their underwear. They don't get involved in criminal surveillance. [MUSIC PLAYING] Who contacted you? Does it matter? I'm an auditor for the attorney general's office. I was working on a case. It wasn't this case originally. But they seem to be connected somehow. And Steve, you were contacted totally at random because you've got something important. Yes, my freedom. I'm not in jail for fraud. [MUSIC PLAYING] That guy that stopped you, that bumped into you, he found something very valuable. Very important. And he gave it to you. You don't exactly have a big credibility account here. I know. OK, I lied. I lied about being the blind date and lied about being Sandy's roommate and about the shopping bag thing. But I'm telling you the truth now. You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you in the leg. Steve, you have got to trust me. Who contacted you? This is important. There's two investigators from the Department of Public Safety. You saw ID? You know they were from the state? I didn't ask for their birth certificate. They seemed genuine. I-- Kevin's game is starting. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Go, guys. Come on, get to the center line. Cut them off before they get there. Come on now. Come on. Look alive. Where is Denise? Denise, hi. I want you to get in for Brittany, OK? Now? Yeah, now. - Now, now, now. - No, Denise. Next game. Yes, now now would be good. Thank you. - Hey, Kenny. Yeah. Where's Kevin? Um, I don't know. I was about to ask you the same thing actually. He went to the bathroom about ten minutes ago. I'm not sure where he's at. But if you see him, tell him to get back here. Denise is killing me out there. Come on. Let's go guys. KELLY JORDAN: What is it? Kevin's not here. He went to the bathroom and never came back. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. KIDNAPPER (OVER PHONE): Mr Hitchcock, I have your son. He's safe for now. Who is this? He's-- You have an item containing some very important numbers, and I want it. Item. What item? You received in the mall yesterday. You know what it is. No, know what what is? Look, I don't know anything. Let me talk to Kevin. You don't contact the police or talk with anyone. Or your son will die. Do you understand? Yes. Oh, OK. Well, I'll contact you in exactly two hours to arrange delivery. But how-- KIDNAPPER (OVER PHONE): You keep this phone with you. So are you with the mob? CIA, NSA, the phone company? Somebody kidnapped Kevin. Now, I want to know what you know now. What did he say? How do you know it was a man? It was a lucky guess. Please, what did Norman give to me? I don't know, Steve. He just said he put something in your bag. Steve, you-- you can't look for something if you don't know what it is that you're looking for. Then help me. Kevin is all I have that means anything to me. What is going on? What about Norman? Can't you ask him? He was hit by a van. He's in a coma. All your friends this lucky? [MUSIC PLAYING] Norman and I weren't actually working on the same case. AG's office had me following a fraud investigation in the Department of Transportation. And Norman was working on some kind of computer tampering thing in the executive offices. Whatever it is, we have to find it now. They have Kevin. I know. What are we looking for? Something that would tell us what he was working on. Got to figure out what those numbers were for. If you weren't working on the same case, why did he call you? The message on his answering machine said that he had something to give me. Something about numbers. He was going to give it to me at the mall, but he gave it to Kevin instead. Wouldn't you Attorney General know? He's not available until tomorrow. What case were you working on? Counting irregularities. There's an audit on Wednesday. But what we need to know is what Norman was working on. I'm not going to figure this out in time. KELLY JORDAN: Yes, we will. We have all the answers here. We just don't know the right questions. [PHONE RINGING] Has it been two hours already? Hello. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Hello, Mr Hitchcock. Listen carefully. Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom. Do it now. Your son's life depends on it. I'll call you back in thirty seconds. Wrong number. Go to the bathroom. OK. [PHONE RINGING] Agent Osborne. Now, listen. We know who took your son and where he's being held. Who would take him? Who would take him? SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): There's no time to explain now. Look, I-- I know you've been thrown right into the middle of this. We'll get Kevin back. But you have to work with us. We believe the man who took your son may work for Kelly Jordan. You sure? SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Stay with her. Find out what she's after. If you do, call me on my card number and don't confront her. Both you and your sons lives are at stake. If I find it, I will. Look, would you call me when you get Kevin back. That's a hell of a lot more important. He'll be all right. Find that item quickly. Don't worry we'll get him back safe and sound. Thank you. Where's the shopping bag and the things that you bought? It's on my kitchen table. Well, whatever it is, it's not here. So let's get the bag. [MUSIC PLAYING] BLAINE MITCHELL: I got the photo from security. It was a credit card. We can stop him now. No longer than that. We've been through everything. It's got to be this. Why? Because it's right here in front of us. So are my underwear. Why isn't it them? Numbers, Steve. This is the only thing that makes sense. Kevin bought that before Norman ran into us. I mean, how could he have known? I don't know. He's always been good on computers. He's good at everything. He'll be all right. We're going to find it. We don't even know what we're looking for. All right, Norman would make it really simple. It's-- It's got to be something else. But there is nothing else. Numbers. Maybe you have it on you. Fine, look. What's-- what's your relationship with Norman? Me and Norman? Oh, we're-- we're friends. We've been friends a long time. I trust him. Why? He's got good eyes. [MUSIC PLAYING] You've got good eyes. Wish I had a brain to go with them. Help yourself. KELLY JORDAN: I don't know. It's got to be something that we're seeing, but we're not seeing. That queen on the red king. Hey, you're pretty good at this. You think? Yeah. You ever played dumb luck. MINNIE HITCHCOCK (OVER ANSWERING MACHINE): Kevin, where are the numbers? The bus leaves in half an hour. Call me. Steven, did you find your underwear yet? HARRY (OVER ANSWERING MACHINE): Yeah, this is Harry at Binny's restaurant. Look, your National Express card is over its limit. Call the restaurant and make arrangements to get it paid. CPA who doesn't know his own account balance? I'll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Agent Osborne, I have it. Do you have Kevin? We can move in any time. STEVE HITCHCOCK (OVER PHONE): Not any time. Call me when you have him, and I'll get this to you. We're on the same side, Mr Hitchcock, OK? Yeah. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): I have some instructions for you. Full house. In your dreams. I call. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, stop. Ah, ow. You don't do that. And give me my money. Ah, you know half that's mine. Half yours nothing. We're running out of time here. Yeah, I know. Well, so what are you going to do? Make up something plausible. Hell, who knows? It might even be right. So what's going on? Did you figure it out? Just play along with me. If I'm wrong, I'll bluff. I mean, it could be anything, like you said. Yeah, but we don't even know what it is that Norman is working on. I mean, he didn't have anything on him at the hospital. Wait a second. Excuse me. Except for this. Campaign button? Yeah, it's very not Norman. He's not a political kind of guy. It's so strange. This whole thing is strange. You know, he wrote the letters DL on the back. Dumb luck. What? It's just a game that Kevin and I play in the car. Kind of like Liar's Poker. We call it DL, dumb luck. You know, Steve, they may already know what it is that they're waiting for. It's a chance I'm going to have to take. And you don't have to though. Look, I'll do anything to keep Kevin safe. OK, anything. I care about you guys very much. It's kind of my problem with you. That you will do anything. Right now I need somebody I can trust. You can trust me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Well, let's see what you got there, big man. Ooh, I think you're going to bet the whole boat. Hold up. Oh, not this way, bud. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE: Public safety. Hands up in the air. You in big trouble now. Get down on the ground. [GRUNTING] Kevin. Are you OK? Well, yeah. But how did you know where to find me? Someone is waiting to hear from you. [PHONE RINGING] SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Osborne, Mr Hitchcock. Act as though you're talking to the kidnappers. You understand? Yes, I understand. Kevin's safe. We've got him. Hi, dad. You should have seen it. They nailed this bozo. It was so cool. And-- He's fine. Ah, the item. Yes, I have it. Um, where would you like to meet? SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Fifth avenue and Wilson. One hour. And be sure to bring Jordan along. She doesn't know we've got the boy. We'll have more them all in one neat package. Be careful. Yeah, I will. What? We have an hour, come on. Take this in case we'll need it. We should call the police. And tell them what? How about kidnapping. How about it? Is there anything you want to tell me? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. So you're not going to call the police. No. KELLY JORDAN: Well, then can we please go by my office because there's something that I have to do. It will only take a second. My-- my son has just been kidnapped, and you want to do what? Well, you don't want to get there early, Steve. Especially if you don't call the police. Please. Five minutes. I'll just be a minute. [MUSIC PLAYING] Osborne. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Is Jordan with you? Are you alone? No, I mean yes. Listen, I think that Daniel Lubek might be involved in this. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): Yes, it's a possibility we've already considered. We think the numbers Byers had are possibly Swiss bank activation codes. You mean I'm right? Wait a minute. That doesn't necessarily mean that-- that Kelly's involved in this, does it? SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE (OVER PHONE): It's highly unlikely that she isn't. We believe the money's been embezzled for the AG's office. Perhaps to finance Mr Lubek's campaign. I got to go. KELLY JORDAN: OK, let's go. Is there anything you want to tell me about your boss? Oh, Dan, what? DL, remember. Daniel Lubek. Oh, there's no way. He's not involved in this. How can you be so sure? And maybe you're just being used by someone you trust. Well, yes. I trust him. And no, I'm not being used. I know what I'm doing. I wish I did. Stay in the car, Brunswick. You sure about this? I'm not sure of anything anymore, but I have to do something. You carry a gun? CAs don't carry guns. Maybe they should start. [MUSIC PLAYING] Kevin, you OK? KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Yeah. SPECIAL AGENT OSBORNE: He's fine. Do you have the item? Yes. Come here, Kevin. May I have it? First Kevin. My son. We're on the same side, Mr Hitchcock. Hold it. Don't even think about it. Give me the card, Steve. - What? KELLY JORDAN: Something's wrong here. They're all in on this. Is everybody in on it but you? Just trust me, OK? Trust you? CPs don't carry guns, remember? BLAINE MITCHELL: Put down the weapon, Miss Jordan. I promise you I will shoot to protect the boy. Please, put down the weapon. I-- Kevin. I don't want the card. I just want to go home with my son. Blaine Mitchell. You were behind the phony contractor loans the states been paying out. Thank you, Agent Osborne. So what do you want with a credit card? Thanks to Mr Hitchcock here. We now have enough evidence to convict both you and Daniel Lubek of extortion, misappropriation of funds, kidnapping. That's-- that's a lie. The FBI has been on to Lubek and company for quite some time. That's what this investigation was all about. I'm truly sorry you got caught in the middle. That is a lie. Is it? Steve, I know that I have not been completely honest with you. But it's because I haven't wanted to involve you and Kevin in this. I just-- I care about you two more than I can't even tell you. Brilliant performance. Almost as brilliant as the performance you gave earlier today when she came to my campaign headquarters, introduced herself as Delores somebody using the most God awful Texas accent you've ever heard. I knew I recognized the face. I just couldn't quite place it. That was you, wasn't it? Yes, that was me. I was at your office. I was trying to figure out the connection between Norman and Mitchell's campaign. Steve, Norman had information about Mitchell, and he was trying to give it to me on the phone. And he didn't have time, and the numbers on that card, that's evidence against Blaine Mitchell. What if-- what if she's not involved. Maybe it was just Lubek. Maybe it was, but they are quite close. I remembered where I had seen that face before. I give you the soon to be Mrs. Daniel Lubek. Well, maybe not seen to be now. Steve. Steve, Steve. I am engaged, and I'm breaking it off. That's why I wanted to go to the office. I wanted to talk to him. Nobody was there, remember? So I went in the office, and I wrote him a note. Ah, then this is not good anymore? Just saved myself a present. Agent Osborne, suppose you take this over to the FBI headquarters. I believe they close in about thirty minutes. What will happen to her? It's up to the courts. In any case, Mr Hitchcock, the state really is grateful for your help. Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wonder why he said that. Who said what? To get to the FBI before they close. The FBI never closes. That's right. Dad, it's the guy that grabbed me. Are you sure? He's with Agent Osborne. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Yeah, I know. They're all in on it, dad. Kelly is in big trouble. Yeah. So what are we going to do? This isn't like playing poker. Well, I wish you hadn't taught him that. Now, he does it everywhere. We need to buy some donuts. Donuts. I've got an idea. And I know it'll work. I don't like this. It's too dangerous. You stay here. But dad, it's got to be me. They won't be suspicious of a kid. Besides, Brunswick listens to me. Well, why doesn't anybody listen to me ever? No, Kevin, no. Come on, I can't take the chance. It's work, dad. You know it will. He'll be right there. [MOANING] You just stay quiet. Come on, please. No chances. OK, are you ready? No. [MOANING] Yeah, you just keep quiet. You make too much noise. [MUSIC PLAYING] Kevin, what you doing here? Hey, I just remembered something. So I brought this game back. You know that guy Byers? He said I should buy it. And I'll bet that's what the numbers are. In here, I figured it might be important. Could be. Good thinking. What do you have in that bag? Well, I brought you some glazed donuts. Oh. My dad said it would be OK. You know, just kind of like a thank you. It's not much. Pretty good, huh? SPECIAL AGENT KURUMADA: Mm, very good. I think glazed donut is my favorite food in the whole world. You know, I not have lunch today so I just keep these, OK? Yeah, that's what I figured. Now, will you unlock her handcuffs? What? They're poisoned and pretty fast acting too. What are you talking about, kid? Sodium hydrochlorite. It takes about two minutes. So you've got a minute and 45 seconds down. There is an antidote, but you have to take it before the poison gets into your system. Brunswick, Brunswick. You can't giving me poison donut. I already did. And I can prove it. See this dog's smaller than you. And it works faster. I'm not bluffing. Kids don't have poker faces. You kill your own dog? Not my dog. If you unlock her handcuffs, I'll give you the antidote. What's going to stop me from just shoot you dead right now? No. No antidote. My dad's got it. Think about it. Would my dad let me take this kind of a chance if it wasn't true? How do I know you're not going to trick me again? Well, it won't matter in 56 seconds. No, I'm not doing all that. I'm going to shoot you. Don't move, I'm going to shoot you dead. Oh. All right, dad. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE MURMURING] What? OK, I hurt my hand. That was stupid. Get the key for the cuffs. On the table. STEVE HITCHCOCK: OK. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: But it worked, didn't it? STEVE HITCHCOCK: All right. Kevin, you could have gotten yourself killed. Nah, he was too busy trying to figure it all out. How could you let him do that. STEVE HITCHCOCK: It was his idea. Here, point this at him. Oh, wait. OK, come on. Hey, give me antidote. There isn't an antidote. What do you mean no antidote? No antidote. Stay. You hit me. Yeah, I did. Stay there. You tricked me. You hit me. What are you doing? STEVE HITCHCOCK: OK, here. Sorry. We got to go. You can have the rest of them. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Come on, Brunswick. Let's go. Come on. Like the magic dog. So this poison or not poison? Oh, that smells not poison. I cant believe that you had Norman's credit card the whole time, and you didn't tell me. What is it with you? Do you ever tell the truth? I didn't lie. I just didn't say anything. That's called an omission of truth. That's like lying without opening your mouth. Forget that, all right? You had Norman's card the whole time, and you didn't even tell me. No, no, I just realized it at the house. His card looks exactly like mine. That's what he stuck in my shopping bag. You lied to me. No, I didn't. I just didn't mention it. That's an omission of truth. That's lying without opening your mouth. Thank you. Thank you. Steve, thank you. Both of you. I don't know why you came back. But I really do appreciate it. I'm really grateful. Sure. Well, the numbers just didn't add up. You know you gave him the winning lottery numbers. You figured out the winning lottery numbers? No, not us, Norman. That's-- that's what this is about? The lottery. - It has to be. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: It has to be what? Somehow Norman figured out that Mitchell rigged the state's mainframe computer. That's how lottery numbers are picked. A random series of numbers are put through the state's mainframe, and a computer program picks the six winning numbers for the state lottery, which is tonight. And Norman reprogrammed it somehow. What does that mean? It means that he changed their numbers to his numbers. His account numbers. Well, that means we can access it. Well, maybe. STEVE HITCHCOCK: Yeah, but credit cards have fifteen numbers. How do we know which ones? So Mitchell wins the diamond lotto, and he puts back the embezzled funds into the bank before the state audit on Wednesday and still has enough money left over to win an election. It's brilliant. All he has to do is claim the money in somebody else's name, and he slides right into the governor's mansion. And you gave it to them. For a CPA, you're not bad. All you girl spies say that. That means the only way to stop them is to change the numbers before the telecast at 7 o'clock, and it's so four. So what do we do? Somehow wake up Norman. Well, I think I can do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] STEVE HITCHCOCK: That's his desk? KELLY JORDAN: That's his desk over there. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: Is that it, dad? STEVE HITCHCOCK: Yeah, come on, Kevin. OK. This can't be Norman's computer. It doesn't have any of his files in it. - Norman had a laptop. - What? A laptop? - Yeah. Where is it? Dad, check it out. Brunswick found it. Good boy, Brunswick. STEVE HITCHCOCK: All right, here. Come on. OK, we've got three hours to open Norman's file and figure out how to change those numbers, guys. Kevin, can you do it? Yeah, I think so. He told me what numbers to pick when we were in the mall. - What? - He did? Why didn't you tell us? I just remembered. KELLY JORDAN: Well, what did he say? Pick the small numbers. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] OK, I'm in on Norman's hard drive. I just have to figure out the file that he was working on, and what he named it. What was the case he was on? The state computer mainframe, an unauthorized entry probe. That's all I know. Try that one. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: There's like a hundred here. This is going to take awhile. Maybe not. Maybe he put them in order like a CPA. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: By date. Yeah, you're right. Here's the most recent file. What would he call the case? Hold on, I'm trying to think like Norman. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] Well, the file's open. But I can't get in to the program itself without Norman's password. There's got to be a way to figure this out. It's got to be something simple. Something that he would remember. How about acronyms. You know, the letters in each of the files. Well, maybe, but there's like a thousand combinations. And we've got fifteen minutes left until the drawing. If he said something-- He wrote something. Wait. Remember this? DL, what does DL stand for? Dumb luck. Diamond lotto. Try diamond lotto. Not bad for an auditor. OK, now we have to use the program to change the lottery numbers. What's all that? It's the programming instructions for changing the lottery program. There's like a gazillion combinations it can be. And we have to try all of them. KELLY JORDAN: Well, so how long will it take? KEVIN HITCHCOCK: We won't live that long. Hey, you know what this kind of reminds me of? What? Actuarial tables. Kevin, type in this breakdown. But look how many there are. Just type in this breakdown. Come on. 0, 8, 1. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHATTER] That's what this is essentially. It's an actuarial table. It's a self-running one. So what does it say? It doesn't say anything. The program just picks numbers based on percentage ratios. And Norman eliminated all the double digit numbers. Now, we have to access the mainframe though. I had to access the state's network through the ethernet. One second. OK, I'm in. Kelly, what's your password? My password? Yeah, your personal password to the mainframe. You don't have a whole lot of time. Boobs. What? Boobs. B, O, O, B, S. Boobs. Um. OK, yay. Mount this on the hard drive. How long will it take? It takes a minute to load. Well, we don't have a minute. All right, we are ready in 5, 4, 3. [MUSIC PLAYING] LOTTO HOST: That's right, ladies and gentlemen. $29 million jackpot. It's loaded. Enable the program. Hello and welcome to Diamond Lotto, the 25th anniversary of Powerball play, where our money could be your money if you have one of these. So let's get to it. Let's find out who the first lucky number winner might be. Somebody's going to be a lucky millionaire. [MUSIC PLAYING] And the number is seven. LOTTO HOST: First number is seven. They have the first number. But the mainframe won't let the program load. It's because the primary sequence is already in progress. We had to time it to enter before the random number selection. All right, here. Type in the second number. And then try to run the program again. Pay attention now, all you sevens out there. The second number is-- It's not fast enough. We're locked out again. LOTTO HOST: It's 0. 7, 0. Wait, I have an idea. It's just like playing dumb luck. What? We have to bluff the mainframe. It's not trying to enter the whole program, just into the next sequence. With what? A number? No, just bluff. Three of a kind. It won't know which one of them to choose. And it'll have to rerun the probabilities. You might be able to boot Norman's program. If you hit between the picks, you could get in fast enough to change the last number. And if I don't? Get used to saying Governor Mitchell. LOTTO HOST: Third number is 7. 7, 0, 7. They have the third number. OK, so what are the odds on three ladies? STEVE HITCHCOCK: 5 to 1. KEVIN HITCHCOCK: It's working. The mainframe is going for it. Man, I should have made it four of a kind. LOTTO HOST: The fourth number is 8. 7, 0, 7, 8. Fourth number is up. Spinning the next one. I'm almost in. No, it locked me out again. (GROANS) LOTTO HOST: Now, pay close attention. We have two more numbers to go. Kevin, again. LOTTO HOST: It's number 0. Imagine that. Two zeros. 7, 0, 7, 8, 0. The fifth number is a 0. Pulling the lever. I'm in. LOTTO HOST: 8. No, it stopped. Ah, I didn't change the number. There you have it, ladies and gentlemen. The winning lotto number 7, 0, 7, 8, 0, 8. If you have the winning numbers, you've just won $29 million. We're going to cut now live to the Claremont Hotel with Lieutenant Governor Blaine Mitchell. [APPLAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, I know this is going to come as a big shock to most of you. But today, I am announcing my candidacy for the governorship of this state. [CHEERING] BLAINE MITCHELL (ON TV): We're going to have-- We're going to have a very difficult campaign ahead of us. Um, it's going to be a long and tough campaign. There are a lot of issues that we have to get to the people. But I would like to make this campaign a little different. I'd like to make this a campaign of the people. Of the people, by the people, and for the people. Not only are we going to be reaching out for their support and their votes, but I want to reach out to help them. And symbolic of that commitment, I'm announcing today that I am donating to the mayor's fund for the homeless $500,000. [CHEERING] Thanks for trying, kiddo. This sucks. The time is now. Interested in dinner? I can't. Um, I got a message from Daniel here. He wants to talk. I do too. Sure. [APPLAUSE] Well, there you go. You just got finished watching Blaine Mitchell announce his candidacy for governor. We do have some other news to tell you about right now. So far we know there are two winners in the big Diamond Lottery Powerball. One of them is at the Golden Retirement Center. We are headed in that direction right now. We will bring you the very latest as soon as we get there. Bob and Hope, back to you. Grandma won. What? I gave her the first small numbers that I saw. Off dad's receipt. I'll never see her again. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] Yes, you won. Congratulations. What's the matter? You won, didn't you, grandma? Oh, no. I didn't win. What happened? You left the numbers on the machine, but I didn't get the message. She did. [CHEERING] But she sold the numbers to the space case here. They all won. They all won? MINNIE HITCHCOCK: Yeah, all 267 of them. Those are just the ones that could walk. It works out to $619,577.63. I didn't get squat. [CHEERING] That means that Mitchell didn't win. Well, he still did win. But only $619,577.63. But after he donates his $500,000 to the homeless, he's not going to have enough left to repay the theft to the state transportation office. What if he doesn't donate it? Well, then he's a fraud to the voters. He's got no way out of this. [LAUGHTER] Wait, mom. Mom, please. Mom, please don't be sad. Listen, think of all the Pinochle you can hustle from these people. You'll own the place in six months. Can I? Uh-uh, what? I have to leave. Oh, so you've decided there's going to be a Mrs. Lubek after all, huh? Yeah. [CHEERING] No, mom. Please. There's people here. MEGAN CLARK: If you haven't heard her story, you haven't heard her name yet. This is one story you're definitely going to want to pay attention to. I'm here with Mrs Emma Feldstein, the generous lady who shared her winning lottery numbers with all of her friends. Mrs Feldstein, just a quick question. Tell me, what was your secret to winning the lottery? Losing at Pinochle. [LAUGHTER] Losing at Pinochle. There you go. I'm not sure what that means, but that was our story. That's it for us here. I'll send it back to you in the studio. We're about ready. Mhm. It's hard to believe, huh? Yeah. I couldn't have done it without you. I'm your campaign manager. And I'm your campaign accountant. Mr Lubek, if you don't get some hefty campaign contributions, you're going to be broke a month before election day. Party should kick in. They had to endorse me. Their other candidate's going before the grand jury. Hey, winner governor, can we come and visit you at the mansion. Oh, I'd be honored. You and Brunswick. [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] No, thank you so much, so much, for the wedding present, Dan. It was just so sweet of you. DANIEL LUBEK: It's the least I could do for such a big career boost. Oops, something to take care of. Thanks, you two. Disappointed that you're not Mrs Lubek. One is enough, his mother. She wanted her ring back so I gave it to her. Well, speaking of mothers. Your mother called. She wants to come over and play bingo. Oh, boy. She's got you pegged already. How do you feel about doing extra laundry? Oh, well, you should talk. You lose 20 bucks in two hands at dumb luck. He never could bluff. Come on, boy. (WHISTLES) Come on, Brunswick. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING]
