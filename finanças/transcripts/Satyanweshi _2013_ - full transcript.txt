How long to dawn? Figured out where we're going, father? Balbantapur. Further west. Want to rest? Walked you the whole night. What to do, had no choice. I know. We're fine. Will we find a place to wash up on the way? Go, no one's up yet. Won't see. Father, sit. I've heard the ruler of Balbantapur is kind, compassionate. May be he'll shelter us. Lost everything. Remains just you two and this trunk. Only one thing worries me... What? You're my good girl. Binita's young. Heedless. A palace's luxury… Sister! Father! What happened? Father!- - Sister! Father, look, look, she… No! Father let's go once. Please let's go! The place is death. Father, please let's go, may be we can save her! Go, we won't return. The swadeshi movement in Calcutta gained further momentum with the arrest of three students of the Hindu College. It is reported that the group of students…- Maharaj Speak. A letter from the Kumar Bahadur, Maharaj Oh. All well? Shall I leave it here? Would you like to read it in private? Feel that's necessary? Not really. The prince is fine, happy. Studies? Read what he's written. Deeply respected lord and father… My deep respects to everyone. Studies going well. This Christmas holidays I went to Leeds with an English classmate. To his country home. This Yorkshire or Leeds is quite secluded a place. Outside the town, hence isolated, silent. Much like our Balbantapur. The other day we went partridge shooting. Didn't understand the fuss. Our wild hens taste better. I would be worried if it was the other way round. A minor request. What is it? A poor Brahmin and his daughter… seek shelter. Why? Says his home burnt down. Shelterless since then. Make arrangements for now. Will see. And listen... The search for Himangshu's bride; progressed? Could have drowned myself easily in the river. But that was another day. Today I don't have that grief nor courage. If you leave me, I'll accept it. But... why should I die? No! My... youth and new found happiness... I won't ever pester you. But... don't kill me. Don't kill me please!- - Should have died. Your father spoilt you. Oof! To study a part you need to think. You spoilt that Ma! That's all you can do. Pretend all day. Ever done housework? You've to go to your in laws soon… I won't marry, Ma.- - What! I'll be a courtesan. Oh, Ma I'll be a courtesan! Go away! What's your dynasty? We're Vaidyas. Giving out medicines... writing letters for villagers. How did the fire start? Don't know Maharaj. Deliberate? Suspect anyone?- - I'm a poor Brahmin, live with my studies. Why would anyone… Studies? Religious? Do you teach? Not enough to teach Maharaj. But I am a Brahmin after all. I live with Brahminical texts. Call it a fancy…or..- What's your fancy? You must be aware of the Vaitangshik Brahmins. No... not exactly. Can't remember. Refers to a net... for trapping birds. A snare? More or less. And 'Vaitangshik'? Minor royal attendants. Accompany the king on hunts. Vaitangshik Brahmins could mimic birdcalls and draw them to one place. Really! It is these almost lost arts that fascinate me. Look for texts on the subject… or try to copy them by myself… And if anyone...- - No, you're really a wise man. It's a royal duty to harbour the wise. Are they coming or going back? Going back. Winter's almost over. Send a word to the Minister. Ask if... he's sent the package to Kumar Bahadur in England. Sure. The Maharaja's unwell. Minister's sent for you. There are courts and laws, I know. But the universe's greatest court has summoned me. You both are... Brahmins. You and... and my God are my witnesses. In my absense... the heir to Balbantapur... is my only son, Himangshu. If he marries a foreigner, then... he forfeits his rights. And any child of his will also forfeit. But... things are changing Maharaj. Does it…- Himangshu is my son. This is my kingdom. You marry your son as you like. One more thing… I want Himangshu to have a son within 3 years of marriage. A legitimate child. The task of finding an appropriate bride is Chandrashekhar's. I'm giving him this responsibility in front of everyone. Heir within 3 years Or else... or else? Gets cold, you won't drink it. Here. Thank you. You took the shikaar (hunting) invitation quite seriously. Ever noticed hunting stories and detective ones are very similar? Like? An unknown beast kills or injures a person. Looking, tracking through footprints, chasing, cornering the beast– that's a hunter's job. Similarly when a man harms the human society, when a man kills another, proving his guilt and cornering him, that's a detective's job. What will I call your friend? I call him Himangshu. That's because he's you friend. Don't have to call him Maharaj, right? What you think best… no imperial highnesses though! Hey Ajit... Put this in your bag. Will forget it. How much longer? Or is the train late? From now on write historical novels, Ajit. You do that well. - - What do you mean? Know how much my detective novels sell? From the day Himanghshu's invitation arrived... till today... I've been waiting for you to ask. A whole train journey is over. Just the two of us. Never once brought it up even by mistake. Brought what up? Going to a royal palace on an invitation. Why did a Bengali royal family name their kingdom Balbantapur? Oh that. Thought of that in the very beginning. You did? Then thought some ancestor must've come from the west. Even in that case... whoever it was who came down... must have been very powerful, because it was after him the kingdom was named. Now... someone so important, how did his name get lost?- - Lost? Look... every dynasty has an... unwritten rule to it's nomenclature. Like... it should match the name of the founder... or the end letter. In this case... it could be... Balbanta... Ananta... Diganta... Sumanta... Proshanta...- - Yes, Proshanta. Jashabanta.- - Jashabanta. But... see... Himangshu and Balbanta. Nor the name matches. Nor the end. Well then, ask your friend. Namaskar. Namaskar.- - Namaskar. Carriage reached you? No problems? Wow!- - Yes. Truly Balabanta's heir. So... did you actually come to Bengal from the west? No. Never heard anything like that. Then why that costume? Oh. Had to shave my head for father's funeral. So wore a turban. Then saw its not going with the suspenders. So the sherwani came in. Oh, so you had only shaved your head? Not your moustache? Good question. Actually the moustache was commissioned. The painter was asked to do it. Can I see your family tree once? Just academic interest. Of course. Please. Namaskar. Did you hear that? A tiger? God! How far is the jungle? Good you reminded me. Have to ask for a map. Now you've got a plot for a story hopefully. You're my lucky guests. Heard a tiger's roar after a long time. Really tigers in your jungle? There were. Mostly stuffed in our house. I've been hunting since I was 17 or so. I'm 32 now. Haven't seen a tiger even once. Not man eaters, right? Tigers usually aren't maneaters. Only if other meat runs out... the way poachers are killing deer and pigs, one never knows. Wait. May roar again. Good thought. Tell him what to call you. Maharaj? Your Highness? Your Majesty? Himangshu or Bablu. Bablu's my pet name. But I will call you Mr. Ajit. Namaskar. The humming... was it yours? Didn't think you'd hear. You sure know by now, my better half. Can call me by my name but Aloka would prefer Her Highness. Will you be quiet? Heard the tiger? Really? No. Did not notice. Not interested in shikaar perhaps? Were you in Calcutta recently? Recently? Say in the last 2 weeks. Why, no. Strange! The song you were humming. A film song. Released last week. Saw it before coming. Can't be showing that cinema here so quickly? No cinema halls in Balbantapur. The Raja doesn't believe in cinema or theatre. To him the hunt is the supreme entertainment. But I've heard this song in the cinema. Please sit. You must excuse me. Will you come in once? Please excuse us. What is wrong?- - Why did you bring them? Quiet. What 'why'? Fine, you did. But could have let me know. It is for you that I called them here. Thought of me?- - Yes. After it happened, you haven't eaten nor slept. You're always upset. I don't like that. Open my broach. Sometimes this palace seems strange to me. A human being disappears. And no one bothered… It's a false allegation Aloka. You know nets have been cast in the river. Jungle's been searched inch by inch. All the dogs have been sent to various directions. Oh. This too is just a hunt for you then? Can't do anything if you won't believe. Not even a police case was filed. Who said so? The Minister himself made a diary. Balbantapur police are an extension of the palace. Everyone knows that. Truth is, all the townspeople... are your subjects. Could've sent word to the Scotland Yard. But Bomkesh... I respect him far too much. Bomkesh? You mean Bomkesh Bakshi? The truth seeker? Yes. Was he among the two men?- - Yes. With the glasses. Oh. Though I found the other man sharper. He is Ajit Bandyopadhyay, Bomkesh's friend. Novelist. Before he finishes investigating, Want to speak to Mr. Bomkesh by myself. Don't send them back without him talking to me. Won't be good. Everyone knows they've come to hunt. You're the only one I've told. Keep it to yourself please. Like the room? Yes. Only an ashtray is missing. Don't smoke for some days. Open the windows. Will feel fresh. Cold at night?- - A little. Haven't they given you blankets?- - Yes. Would have brought more if we knew you liked them. What kind of a Bengali doesn't love sandesh? Despite studying in England he's a true Bengali. See, Hemen Ray- - No, he is Hemen Majumdar. Hemen Ray is a famous writer of detective novels. Our previous generation. Can Ajit be taken around the palace? Writers too are humans after all. A lot many story ideas are leaping in his head seeing the palace. Thinking of writing about us? No. Bomkesh is just...- - Please do! Good thought. Come, I'll escort you around the palace. Wanted a word with you in private, Bomkesh. Sure. You want to talk now? No. We can speak later. Come Mr. Ajit. Our dynasty's founding goddess. Where's the pain? Neck or waist? No, nothing serious. Sat in the train for a long time. May be because of the jerking... or due to wrong sleeping posture. From the town, you see. Not used to hard work. Do herbs really work? Don't take them if... you don't believe. Insults Ayurveda. No.. err.. I did not mean it like that. In Calcutta we take tablets for aches. In that context will Ayurveda work? Fine. I shall myself come tomorrow morning to check if... you're relieved. What! Err.. please...- No, skills have to be tested once. No. That won't be necessary Mr. Kaligati. He isn't disbelieving. Okay. In that case a small wager. If he is better in the morning... your... bottle... your medicine bottle shall be taken by me. Anything you need during the stay, I'm there. Alright then. Don't have bottles. Just a strip of tablets. I'll give it to you. Keshto, where can I find a book here? What sir? Book. A story book. English... Bengali. Is there a bookshelf anywhere here? No but.. err.. they are in the library. Oh. Where's the library then? Open? Can I go once? Here. No. Don't go there now. As in? Ever since the librarian vanished, it is locked. No one goes there anymore. Librarian? Who's he? Late Mrs. Bhubaneshwari memorial library. This is our family library. Collections from four generations here. Can one see? No. It is a little unfortunate. One fine morning... our librarian, Harinath... suddenly disappeared. Disappeared... as in? Disappeared as in disappeared. We looked for him everywhere. Completely untraceable. Where all did you look? The village he came from. And turned Balbantpur inside out. But an entire human being... he cannot just vanish! How can one say? His shoes are there... his clothes are there... witchcraft at night may be. But will people from the city, like you believe all that? Heard the tiger last night? Yes. That night too a tiger was heard. That means... the tiger could have eaten him up? Tigers haven't come this way for ages. Never seen them. Been here for 3 generations. In that case would'nt we have found the body? Sir. My duty's over. This is Kinkar. He'll be here all night. Namaskar. Keshto.- - Yes. Come here fast. Who's she? From the palace? Sir... what is she doing here? Do you know her? She is Leela. Our herbalist's daughter. But... she has not been here for ages. The queen gave her a leave long back. Mr. Harinath. Namaskar Maharaj.- - Sit. Library book. What's it doing here? Reading it. Any problem? No Maharaj. A pleasure. But if the book hasn't been issued properly, will send the register to you tomorrow. Please sign it. Initially I thought he made up the Sanskrit to impress Aloka. That's why I'd compare. But no, he was genuine. And cent percent honest about his work. He would not discriminate at all in that case. Nothing would matter to Harinath. And of all people... Sad. Really sad. Tell Leela, had to break her trunk lock. Otherwise her sari…- - I understand. Let me hear. I feel I believe if there is anyone behind Harinath's disappearence... it is the palace. They think I don't understand. Detective brought in to prove to me the ruler's innocent. Not that stupid. I won't believe that Harinath suddenly, all by himself, disappeared! I think you're really making a mistake. Maharaj couldn't have done this. The entire palace is telling me the same thing. Discussed it there too? Look at me. If I remind you of Leela at all, do something. Goodnight. So... Scared by this? No. That's a jackal. They still call in Calcutta. Hence... can't tease us for being urban. Remain a townie. Not a jackal. A sign. A sign? May hear a tiger tonight. Will you still say that... you have not seen this cinema? Krishnakanta's Will. Rohini. Was meant to do the part. Rehearsed for 3 months. Then 7 days before the shoot…- You didn't...- I did. I did get married. The England returned prince of Balbantapur married me and swept me off on his horse. Brought me here. Why the hurry? From what I heard after marriage... your friend had a couple of romances in England. Oh. That scared, his father, my late father-in-law. What if... a Memsahib comes to Balbantapur as its Queen. Hence, get up girl, marry. End of actress. Beginning of queen. Promotions like these don't usually happen. When I came here after marriage the Minister gave me a box one day. My late father in law had left his daughter-in law some doll's jewellery. So she could play with them! Real ones. Real emeralds, rubies, diamonds. What not! 10 girls from our family standard could have married with that. Nicely. Sent the jewelry to your mother? - - No. After my marriage I haven't touched anything here till today. But the jewellery my mother had been able to give me in my marriage; I went back and gave it all to her one day. Don't do this. It's a tradition to marry a daughter with gold. You've kept the tradition. If I return it... not your fault. But why would you return it? I have your blessings. You have two more daughters to marry off. They have nothing. What's wrong? Unhappy? Been scolded? Is that the truth? Never has he... misbehaved with me. But please don't conclude... that we are friends. Is that a school or college where you'll make friends? I knew it. She would never understand that a married woman too could need a friend. I'm sorry. But I... really made a friend. Didn't think I would... in this exile. But I did find him. But he went away. With all these people around... why should the Rani suspect you? She thinks... I'm jealous. I envy Harinath. And there's no truth in this? No. Then why check if the poems he read were correct? She likes music and dance, likes acting. It is not possible for me to give her such recreations. Could be so... that Harinath's company is more precious to her. Then you agree that they were more compatible? No! That compatibility can last only a few evenings. Then the royal treasure would eventually separate them, right? Anyone would think that. Why blame Aloka? But Aloka knows the truth. What truth? I can't understand. If I tell you, you'll understand... this is not supposed to be told to anyone. Aloka is frigid. She has a... sexual aversion disorder. Been one and a half years we're married... but the marriage has not yet been consummated. Sent to find you a girl. Please. Will hear from them in a few days. Then will speak to the minister.- - You shall do no such thing! As Balbantapur's Rani I too have a responsibility towards the throne. If needed we'll adopt. And I'll carry the brunt of your greatness all my life? Right? I know she gets incorrigible from time to time. One cannot tolerate her! But... at the end of the day... I can't imagine a life without her. Who all know about your... father's will? Father had actually made a wish list. Witnesses were the Minister and... Kaligati. Reading the wish list the solicitor drew up a deed. Let me ask an unrelated question. Yes. How old are your dogs? Which dogs?- - Ones in your kennel. Oh. Some... four to six years. Why? Nothing. Just like that. Please do me a favour, my friend. Please prove to Aloka that I'm not guilty. Please. Going hunting tomorrow? Depends on you. On me? You've been loitering the palace. You're the one who has been chatting up the Rani. Oh. Been broadcast, has it? Everything's news in the palace, Ajit. Is that so?- - Yes. Because all the retainers here have worked for generations. They never question their salary. They feel fortunate to get it. They can never think of questioning how much they're getting paid. Thus, there's no reason to believe that they have money. Therefore... for a few coins… go onto the verandah for a bit. Gone? Kinkar...- - Sir. Listen. I don't believe you Kinkar. My friend told me... he wasn't with the Rani.- - Swear by the goddess. Here. Now tell me... how close was he sitting? If you were the Rani, Sir… he was here. The women in the Rani's chamber, how many are your friends? Some Sir. Can you tell me what happened there... from 6, yesterday evening? I can. Oh. Girlfriend works there? Name's Kuntala, sir. The game... can be played in two ways. Game? Yes, the one you've begun. No, seriously. See. What if we both take two seperate routes to the same truth... then I'll prepare a set of questions, and you another set of questions. Till then we are absolutely independent. As in our fact-finding sources... how we got to know things, our seperate methods. And then? See... The joint game begins when we put each of our set of questions down together. Let's see. You'll know some of my answers; and vice versa, I'll know some of yours. Those will get cancelled out. Those that remain, amongst them some will be common. And some independent. And these questions, Mr. Ajit; shall make the game. Now tell me. Are you game? Call it a game, let's make it like one? How? Why dark? Deepens the mystery. Okay. I'll give you one light. No, wait. Thinking planchettes are you? Who? Harinath. So you're sure he is dead? No. I'm not sure... nor ruling out the idea. Who all are confirmed to be dead? Himangshu's father. Right! Why would he make such a strange will? Why did Late Arunangshu make such a strange will? Easy. Because he came to know about his son's doings. What is the problem between Himangshu and Aloka? Where lies the problem between the king and the queen? In Harinath's disappearence. I had thought of something else. Aloka wanted to become an actress. But was forcefully married off. Hence angry. That was my next question. Why does she sing film songs? Because she was supposed to play that role. Then... question is why didn't Himangshu's dogs react to the jackal's cry? And if Leela's on holiday what was she doing... in the evening today? And holiday meaning where to? Leaving the palace means going to her father's home. To her father. But... didn't see anyone else at Kaligati's this evening. In fact he himself drew out the water. So the entire thing boils down to... the royal palace. The royal palace or the royal family? Which is only two people. The Raja? Or the Rani? See. Don't know if we'll see a tiger. But its tracks, yes. You may never see them this close. Mount. May be nearby. Quick! Fire! One minute! Say if there's a real hurry. I'll run. I'll run and get there. Then your horse will reach. I'll remain who knows where. May I come in? What's up? Why the summons? Please sit. I'm without husband. You're without your friend. Thought we two could talk. Want some?- - No, thank you. The herbal medicine worked? Yes, I never noticed. No pain. How did you know? Herbalist came last night. Wanted sleeping pills. You take sleeping pills regularly? Is there an option? I stroll the palace from one room to another all day. Keep counting the silver utensils. No hardwork, no excitement. How about a picnic tomorrow? Picnic! Thought we'd work indoors. That will keep happening. Can I ask a question? If I ask about Harinath will you be upset? Even if I do get upset... But I have a request. Please tell the truth. You have been brought here... to prove a certain person innocent. But I will not buy that. If you've already drawn the conclusions in your heart... who is guilty... what is his crime... and his punishment... fine then. Let's go for the picnic tomorrow. We'll not think about this. And you would not get upset as well. You and Mr Bomkesh are friends. Don't need to be taught what a true friendship is. Put yourself into my shoes now. Then judge. Let's play a different game today. A very easy game. We'll all write down the names of 3 people we know. People we know? Filmstars? No.- - Writers? Writers like Ajit, yes; since he's known to us. You have to know these people. That means those present here? No. Say... Balbanta, after whom Balbantapur is named. That reminds me, haven't seen your family tree yet, Himangshu. So we write three names. Then what? After that... All the answers will be collected in this box. So write your name behind respective chits. Why? Why these games? What is the point? Let's play a round? We'll change the game if you wish to. Why? I quite like it. Haven't brought a pen.- - I knew it. No pens at picnics. So I brought some. Sorry Himangshu. Brought this from the palace. Here Ajit, you're the writer. Distribute pens. Thank you. Thank you.- - Welcome. Here. Thank you. Minister, if you could collect the chits...- Sure. With pleasure. One thing. There is a time limit to write the names down. 15 seconds. God! So little time?- - Oh. Need a timekeeper then. First round I will. Ajit can in the next one.- - I will. If at all there's a next round. Okay! Is everyone ready? Let's begin? One. Two. Three. Start! Now what? Bull's eye. How many fingers? Don't know. Would be 2 even if you hadn't shaken them Kaligati. Blindfolded? Yes. Everyone can do with open eyes. Oh. Not bull's eye then. But sound barrier. Who's the referee now? If no one objects... Yes, sure.- - Okay! One. Two. Three. And... Bravo! Splendid! Everyone's here. Tell Aloka I brought you here to find out the truth. Not to establish that I am not guilty. What is all this! Don't have to. I trust you. Now let him go. If you're not okay, we can go back in tonight's train. Wouldn't have come if I'd known. Made a promise wouldn't smoke till I solved this case. Took one out, put it on my lips and put it back. For whom? A savage? The game's ours Bomkesh. Getting to the truth is the aim. Does it matter what outsiders think? Put a gun to your neck, wouldn't talk to him. Take your anger out on me. But at the end of the day remember we're truth seekers. Till the truth comes out you keep your vow. Let's go back. Ajit! Look! It is sinking! Ajit, what is the name of this place? Ask the coachman how to get here. Need a map. A map of Balbantapur. The map of Balu Bandhpur. Balu Bandhpur...- - That later became... Balu Bandh...- - Balabantapur... Balbant.- - Correct! Balbandh means what? Bonds of sand? Which is momemtary. Something that does not last. A bond of sand that does not stay. A guard around the sand.- - Why but? To protect some sort of sand... Or... to protect others from that sand. Which is? Ajit! Quicksand! Sorry. We were... I should be saying sorry for this morning. Misbehaved in public. No point apologizing in private. If you want I could apologize to you in public. I recruited Harinath. Our library is 150 years old. No one was there to care of the books. He transformed the library. This place was his life! Never saw anyone so crazy about books. Was proud of my voice, once I heard his voice, realized my voice had a zing in it. But his voice had truth. I fixed Leela. Believed in her completely. I knew I wouldn't have been relieved if I gave the responsibility to anyone else. Do you regret that now? No. Anyway. Let's talk later. One day, all of a sudden Harinath came to me. Harinath. So late in the night? I needed to take some advice from you in private. Should I come in the morning?- - No. Sit. Listen. Go out for a bit. This morning... a strange incident happened. I don't know who to tell. This morning while going through the ayurved cupboard I saw, 2 important volumes are missing. Turned the library topsy turvy, checked the register… if someone has issued them. Why? Doesn't the cupboard have a lock? No. Books haven't been stolen before. Oh. After that? After that... I thought the herbalist could have taken them. Because... no one else needs those books. Went to him. Want to prove me a thief? That's why you're here?- - No, why take it like that... Actually, it is your subject, so thought… I am sorry. Forgive me. Suddenly smelt something strange. As in the same... naphthalene kept on the library shelves. The same naphthalene. I understood... he was lying. Told him not to tell anyone. Not even Leela. Did Harinath and Leela have…- - It is only obvious Sir. A young woman and man…- He's not saying it is unobvious, only wants to know. Harinath agreed, went home. Few days after that Maharaj decided to... go for a hunt in Nayanpur jungle. The Maharaja's friend rules Nayanpur state. It was decided that... Kaligati would go along with him. In case a doctor was needed. Leela went too. So as to take care... of the Maharaj's food. Initially Leela had objected. Ran to Harinath's house. He was with the Rani at that time. What happened all of a sudden? Heard Maharaj is going hunting. Wont you go along? Leela is going. Ghee and fire – put together... melting is inevitable. You can say... I could not be the fire. If someone else can... I might get hurt... but that is foolishness. But... I am sorry to have hurt you. Forgive me if possible. If you think I am your friend... where does the question of forgiveness arise from? No tension about taking Leela? I saw that Aloka was... completely indifferent. Besides... to tell you the truth... I too am a human being. Only hunting down animals can't... satisfy the basic instincts. Where did that come from?- - Getting dusty downstairs. Hung it here. Oh. Reminds you of anything? You've read the epics. Yes. What could be the previous visual to this? Ravana revealing his true self? Before that? Sita scolding Lakshman? Reason? Ram's cry. Ram's cry?- - Yes, Ram... You! Come inside. Namaskar. If Mohammed does not go to the mountain... the mountain has to come to Mohammed. You did not come. So I came down to see you. Please take something. How's the pain? Good. We haven't met since.- - Didn't we? At the picnic? You gave me the medicine strip. Completely forgot. Yes of course. Why blame the memory? Dig too far into the past and present memory fails. Is that what you've come here to tell us? No. To give you news. There's a dry riverbed to the west of Balbantapur. Next to that stands a ruined cottage. That actually served as a rest house to the rulers once. Instead of putting up tents they spent the night there on hunts. And... sometimes girls used to wait for their lovers there. Harinath's disappearance has a link to this history of Balbantapur. Unless you know one, other won't be solved. You mean...- - Let me finish. I want to say that I have only one identity. A truth seeker. Doesn't work with a lazy brain. Need knowledge. Need wisdom. To keep the mind alive, practice and analysis is required. Speak clearly. Harinath is probably residing in that house without anyone's knowledge. Doesn't seem logical to you, isn't it? Why? Want to say he's hiding there? Not my language. Language of truth. In the past few days the house has been seen to be lit up. Thought I'd go there tonight at 1pm looking for the truth. If you both want to...- - Of course we do. Then please reach there on time. But beware about one thing. The cottage has no windows or doors. Just some holes. And you must be knowing... A tiger has been wandering the area. Didn't want to tell the Raja. Because... I don't approve of useless animal slaughter. Don't mistake that house for safe in case you're in danger. The tiger may easily enter. You can hide at the riverbed. That's beyond the jungle. The tiger does not usually come out. But don't worry. I'll get there before you. This is just a warning. Another thing... let this remain between the 3 of us. That's my wish. I'll take your leave now. See you at 1 tonight. Namaskar. True. Hadn't thought of this. Whole kingdom was searched. That house was left out, is it? Seemed convincing to me. Then we must check if it is you alone who are convinced? Or is there someone else who is convinced too. Someone else as in? Go wash your hands. What's the point sitting like this? See! Forgot to ask about this! Why this strange game? Practical reason. Need handwriting samples. And? And? See. 3 names in 15 seconds, the names have to be on the top of the mind. Now let's compare these. Wait. Okay choose one. I?- - Yes, you. Take. Thank you. Aloka. Harinath. Kaligati. Ajit? I have not written Aloka's name. Let's see. Ajit. Bomkesh. Thank you. Kaligati. Harinath. Both have Kaligati common. May be one reason. Both of you have met him the last evening. Aloka as Leela. You as a patient. Let's read a neutral one.- - Whose? Say Chandrashekhar. Chandra... here it is. Chandrashekhar. Himangshu. Harinath. Kaligati. See, Himangshu's name first. Loyalty towards Himangshu, affection for Harinath. Which is why... he does not like Kaligati all that much. May not be neutral after all. But all 3 chits have Harinath and Kaligati in common. Read what Himangshu writes. Himangshu. Ajit. Aloka. Kaligati. Great! Both the King and the Queen have written my name. Don't forget you're a guest. There's a guest etiquette. Yes but... you too are his guest. I don't know Ajit. Himangshu may not be able to resolve that, who has he hired? A friend or a truth seeker? I think that's troubling him constantly. Which means Kaligati is common here too. 4 people think Kaligati and 3 Harinath. See the next one.- - Yes, fifth one. Kaligati himself. Nice. Brilliant! Balbanta. Arunangshu. And the Lion Rider. No one within touch. Yes. So what? Nothing. I'm thinking... is Himangshu already asleep? Kinkar. Do something for me. See whether the Maharaj has gone to bed… Ajit brought the compass? Give. Where's the torch? Light it. Thought it is a tiger! This is the tiger's aunt! But cats are domestic. How did they get to this ruin? Himangshu! Father! Ajit. Show the light. Let's start with Mr Chandrashekhar. Mr Chandrashekhar, even if not directly... from the beginning did Harinath not give you any hint? No... he would say a lot of things. Never gave it much importance. Because you disbelieved him? Not really. I thought he is a book worm, sitting with books all day. So... he must have been imagining things. That the ayurved book might be with the herbalist has one meaning, but the smell in his house is that of the library cupboards, that's another. I thought this was too much. Oh. So you thought Harinath was over imagining things. Thought he was overly suspicious. What is it called... obsession? Why else would he go searching at another person's house? In all that excitement Himangshu didn't realize the tracks were manmade. No difference between front and back paws. Courtesy Corbett Sahib. Correct. Ajit. Go back to that Ramayana story of yours. Let begin with why Sita scolded Lakshman. Hearing ram's cry.- - Ram's cry? Hearing Marich imitate Ram. Marich's voice. Imitation comes down from the age of Ramayana. In Bengali we call it 'Harbola'. Wait. So the tigar calls weren't real? Kaligati was a great actor. Things in his trunk are with Chandrashekhar. Check them. It has wigs, costumes, old medals, everything. Imitated the tiger?- - And the jackel. Your dogs aren't at fault. Never caught a scent. So did not get excited. Called to hear this discussion? What happened to the actual search? Found a trace Whose? Harinath's? No. Proof. When she came back from the hunt who gave Leela leave? Himangshu or you? I. Why? And not after they came back. After four months.- - Why? The reason... is very clear in to all now hopefully. But why are you changing the subject? Not doing so. The two incidents are linked. Leela's leave wasn't hidden from Harinath. Wanted to see her. Asked after her for 3 months. Then followed Kaligati to discover he'd hidden her in that old house. Why kept her hidden? Hid Leela from people to prove to Himngshu that he loved the Raja and wouldn't let his dignity be hurt. Will you leave this and tell me what happened to Harinath? A man leaves without his clothes and shoes. But where? Now I shall put the incidents in front of you all. Leela, correct me if I'm wrong. Harinath went out barefoot wearing a dhoti and shawl. Went straight to the temple. I have a special requiremnt. For now I need the Goddesses' vermilion and garlands. I'll tell you the rest of the requirements tomorrow morning. Talking to the priest my doubts were cleared. Harinath had decided to marry Leela that very night. Tell the rest of it Ajit. This is one place where Kaligati went wrong. He thought... he'd spend his life as the grandfather of the childless Raja's illegitimate son. But that Harinath would marry Leela despite her pregnancy he never imagined such greatness. Where are you taking my daughter? Without asking me? Father!- - Leela is an adult. We've married in the Gandharva tradition. Oh. So much happened. Never bothered to tell the old man? Actually... there is a small ceremony at the temple tomorrow. If you will please be present there... and bless us? Done me a great favour son. But... I am a Brahmin. Truth is my religion. Do you know... Leela is pregnant? I know.- - Oh. Agreeable to that too? The goddess will bless you. Do one thing. Go back for now. When is the ceremony tomorrow? Ceremony, as in... exchanging garlands in front of the goddess. And the Mantras. Then let me bring Leela bathed in new clothes tomorrow? Hope you don't mind? Why would I mind? You're her father. Do one thing. Return to the palace. Come. So his daughter was taken care of. Why should he object? Because he had different plans. Because he knew once Harinath and Leela were married the child would be accepted as theirs. And Harinath might not agree to adoption. And he has already convinced Himangshu adopting Lella's baby would secure his bloodline and throne. Now Kaligata was all ready to be king's grandpa! Cross the dry river and go that way. Don't want people to know you came to my daughter this late. Go. Probably he wasn't born evil, Was a born actor. He witnessed Himangshu's father's will and was tempted. Slowly he became like a quicksand from within, a trap to ensnare people. A twisted complex snare. Leela! Father!- - No! No! Aloka? Aloka. Aloka! Aloka. Hold him. Please go outside. After 7 days we returned from Balbantapur. The official report from the Forests Department said that no tiger had been seen there in 10 years. Library had a new signboard. Harinath Memorial Library. Himangshu and Aloka adopted Leela's son in a celebrated way. Himangshu called him Balbanta. Bomkesh's request. An old legend became reality. Went to see Aloka before I left. She was still weak. Aloka. Another disappearance? Why? I'll come down when I have time. Don't lie. Aren't you a truth seeker? Then you'll get in touch in Calcutta. Some requests always remain requests. Never to become promises. Aloka knew that. Only told me... Leave. Have a safe journey. Namaskar.
