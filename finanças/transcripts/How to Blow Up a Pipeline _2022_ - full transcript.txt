Extreme winter freeze. Meanwhile, Pakistan is still recovering from catastrophic flooding that left tens of thousands dead. A worsening refuge crisis and increased sectarian violence have led many NGOs to caution aid workers against returning to the region. Hey, Monica. I, um, no, I'm sorry I wasn't able to make it today. Hey. Snacks. Does anyone else have anything to share? Theo, please. Um, I don't have much. I guess I was so angry after my diagnosis, but y'all taught me to listen to my anger instead of letting it control me. Have a good night, okay? Yeah, you, too. Okay. Shit, Theo. 15 hours. - Logan, we're gonna be late. - Mmhmm? - Are you ready? - Mm-hmm. I'm going, I'm going, going, going, going. Let's fucking go! Let's fucking go, baby! Woo! Ow! - It hurts. - Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm just too fucking excited! Thank you, Lord, for this food. Let it be nourishment to our bodies. And protect my girls for me while I'm gone. Me and your daughter just want you home alive in time for Christmas. And no handcuffs, neither. - No handcuffs. - Okay. You sure you don't need my help? No, I'm good, I got it. Just, fuck. Xochitl. Hey, Xochitl. Hey, Theo. Theo? You good? Xochitl! - Hey. - Ah! Thought it was supposed to be hot in Texas. No, it's fucking cold. Hey, do you need help? No, I got it. - Hi, I'm Shawn. - Cool. Theo. We just got here a second ago. We've been struggling with the bolt cutters for a minute. - No. - You need some help? No, I'm good. I got it. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah, I got it. Yeah, move. What, did you walk all the way from North Dakota? No. Michael, right? Yeah. - Shawn. - Is that the shed? Yeah. Hey, let me help you with that. I got it. Got it. Okay. - Long drive. - What's up, boss? Got a stove, living quarters. Where's Michael? Went straight to the shed. Want some whiskey? You love it. Dwayne. - Alisha. - Theo. We ready to start workin'? Theo! You have another lighter? - What's up? - Makin' acid. - Come on! - Every fucking time, you do that. Shit. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Fuck. Goddamn, this place is sick. You guys cookin' meth in here? They're here! We're leaving! I'm sorry we're late. Yeah, sorry we're late. The motel took forever, Rowan wanted to look at horses on the way. You wanted to look at the horses, too. What's up, Dwayne? Good to meet you, too. Are there any non-country stations? Come on, what else is Dwayne gonna listen to? You packin', Dwayne? Is that a .35? Can I hold it? Aw, come on. This is a high point. All right... Who's diggin'? Who's keepin' watch? You look nervous. Can you keep steady hands? You've never done this before either, man. All right, I need 90... 96 ml of water. In that one. Okay. Is that 96? Yes, sir. Now stir that. You good? Just got acid on my gloves. Alisha! One down! - Ready? - Yeah. Ooh, she thick. Okay. Uh-uh, there has to be a better way to mix this. I agree. And now... we drip. It's enough lead azide to blow us off the map. Oh shit. I hit metal! Rowan? I need a break. Need a break, too, Dwayne? - Hey. - Hey. It was a beautiful service. Your mom would've loved it. So you a smoker now? Yeah, sometimes. I got a call from her on the day and I sent it to voicemail 'cause I was taking a fucking midterm. I was just being selfish. Xochitl, it was a freak heatwave. That's not your fault. It's just the fuckin' world we live in now. I know it's hard, but... you're gonna fix things, and I know your mom knew that. I don't think I'm gonna fix anything. Well, you have to. You're an orphan now. That's like origin story shit. What the fuck? She was a mom to me, too, you know? Yeah. I do. Alright, we're moving to the quad at 10:30 am sharp. If campus police gives us trouble, remember, do not escalate. Right, and I've secured an onsite medic as well as legal support for anyone who might need it. Shawn... where are we at with the videography stuff? Um, I got a RED package from class, and Morelli says he's down to shoot, so I think we should be able to get some good shit from the demonstration. Great. Speakers start at noon. Xochitl, how's... how's faculty outreach? Yeah, I didn't get around to that. Sorry. Family emergency. Remember? Right, yeah, it's just this is our shot to make real change at our institution, so... Yeah, I'm... I'm just, I'm having trouble feeling like any of this matters. I know you're having a hard time and I'm sorry. Look, nobody's saying divestment's gonna solve everything, but it is a big step in the right direction. Which would be great if we still had time, but by the time any market solution does shit, billions of people will be dead from climate disaster. We all want faster change, but these are huge systems that change incrementally. Right, so act outside of the system. We need to start attacking the things that are killing us. We can take more drastic action. Like what? Like... actual sabotage. Property destruction. Mom, I've been trying. I know, it's just been a difficult semester. It's just a lot, you know? But the new computer is definitely helping. Yeah, you know what, I have to, uh... I actually have to go study. I love you, too. Bye. Hello? Hey, Xochitl? Who is this? Yeah, it's Shawn from Divest. A refinery? No. - Why? - What do you mean why? It's way too big. We could end up killing somebody or causing an ecological disaster. Sabotage is messy. Yeah, but we can't give the public a reason to invalidate us. What about destroying like a coal truck route - or damaging roads? - That's lame. We have to do something that would scare people. What, do you wanna like kidnap an oil exec or blow up a private jet, what? We have to show how vulnerable the oil industry is by hitting something big, like a refinery. What about Texas? That's where they set oil price benchmarks. If we cut off their supply or destroyed something even relatively small, it would really disrupt shit. What do you know about Texas? I mean, what do you know about building a bomb? 50-50's awful. Don't be so negative. Those are good odds. You can't get better odds in Vegas. Odds for what? That we blow ourselves up. Oh, you know, Che figured that nearly half the guys he sent to build bombs blew themselves up, so I'd say like 50-50. See? Told you. Okay, don't get too happy. Check this out. Here. Star, one-two-three. One-two-three. Ooh! - Wow. - Nice work. Thank you. You ready to pack the blasting caps? Just about. Michael, what do you think the odds are we blow ourselves up? I don't really care. Okay. I was telling them about how Che thought that half the guys he sent to build bombs blew themselves up, so... Can we go? - Strange kid. - He's no fun. Listen, if I touch or even jostle this primer too much, it could detonate. I need you to take this, stand 20 yards back. If anything goes wrong... then don't come unless I tell you to, unless you see fire. Don't come in. Got it. Stop it. Come on. One down! I thought they told you at the front office you can't come around here anymore. Go home. Hey, can I ask you a question? What? This is you here? Yes. - 1711? - Yes. You stay warm? Yes, I stay warm in there. Yes. Where you from? I asked you where you're from. It's a simple question. South Carolina. - That's a nice coat. - Don't fuckin' touch me. Don't touch my jacket. It's a nice coat, man. Do not fuckin' touch me. Can I have it? Why don't you go back to where you came from? What? Motherfucker. Don't fuckin' grab me. Eat fuckin' shit, fucker. Fuck! Motherfucker. Four. Five. Oh, how was your day? You can't keep doing this. You're going to get yourself killed. Yeah. Michael, there's so much real work to do. Why won't you help at the conservancy with me? You didn't even ask me what I did. I'm tired of lying to the police. Can you stop? Didn't you used to try? Now you're just a coward, like everybody else. I am not a coward. You want me to sit here and count seeds? You want me to lie down and let them win? How are you winning? Picking fights with men who only come here for work. You're right. I'm a fuckin' idiot. - Our conservancy... - I don't care about the conservancy, okay? I don't care, it doesn't do anything. What does it do? It makes white people feel better. It makes you feel better. And it does nothing! So what did you guys fight about? I mean, you know how she is. Just needed to get out. Here. Take it. Look, you can stay in the garage. Just pull like three shifts a week. There's nothin' to it. Come on, I'll run you through the registers. Is there an... employee discount here? Hey, everyone, welcome back to "Boom Tok". Today is day 19. Teaching myself to make a homemade blasting cap for under $50 in materials. Today we're making nitric acid out of stump remover and drain cleaner. Shit! Hey, everyone. Today I am test dumping the charge of a nine-volt battery to a blasting cap full of lead azide. And if this works, then it'll be step one in making our own improvised explosive. Shit. Oh my God. Michael! - Michael! - Oh shit. Oh! - Michael, you okay? - Stay back. - What happened? - Stay back. Fuck. What the hell happened? Hey, can you breathe? - Can you breathe? - Yeah. Fuck! - Hey, hey! - Stop, stop! - Stay, stay. No. - I'm fine. I'm sorry. Just keep back. - Jesus. - Step back. Just let me finish this. Fuck. - Watch him. - Yeah. Whoa! You tryin' to blow us up? - Jesus Christ, Theo. - Come on, Theo, let's roll. Let's roll? Get it? Got some fresh deer meat, if y'all are interested. I'm vegan. I'm vegetarian. Yo, is Michael okay? Yeah, I hope so. Oh God. I'm gonna go pee. Pee on me. Is it me or is this getting heavier? Yeah, it's soaking up moisture. Fuck. - You're doin' good. - Do it one-handed. - Yep. - Good. Wanna do the three thing again? I feel like that makes it go slower. - Did it? - Yeah. Oh shit, okay. If you just one-hand it. You doin' okay? You done? That looks medium rare, it's pink in the middle. Three caps. Done. - Woo! - Woo! - Michael. - Nice job, Michael. Proud of you. Why don't you grab a plate? The food is so good. A little overcooked, but it's great. It is. Theo, what's with the alcohol? I thought we were gonna keep a clear head. Don't worry about me. My chemical childhood gave me superpowers. I like the way you talk, Theo. Pass that, please. Mm! Mother's milk. I have a blunt. - You have a blunt? - Yeah. I've got some handles in the back if anyone has mixers. Answer the question. Do you feel like a terrorist? Do I feel like a terrorist? Of course I feel like a fucking terrorist. We're blowing up a goddamn pipeline. They're gonna call us terrorists. No, they're gonna call us revolutionaries or game changers. No, they're gonna call us terrorists 'case we're doing terrorism. Who cares what they call us? We ain't hurtin' nobody. Boston Tea Party, they were terrorists of their day. They didn't hurt anybody. Patriots. MLK was called a terrorist. He was on the FBI watch list. Why? He was like nice. No, no, no, no, no. - He was freakin' ruthless. - I'm sorry. You're trying to equate Civil Rights Movement to what we're doing here? - I mean, it's kinda similar. - Look, anytime anyone has challenged authority, they call it terrorism. And then when the terrorism works, they lie about the legacy and they say that it was all passive, nonviolent, kumbaya shit when it's not! If the American Empire calls us terrorists, then we're doing something right. Fuck yeah. What he said, exactly. People talk shit about me my whole entire life. I don't give a shit. Jesus was a terrorist! What? - He was a terrorist! - What are you talking about? You cannot tell me otherwise. - In what lifetime? - Aw! - Okay, considered in his time. - Oh no, Dwayne! He's a martyr now. - We're sorry, Dwayne. - Wait, okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, but for real, we should acknowledge that what we're doing is actually gonna hurt a lotta people. It's not gonna hurt anyone. We're not hurting anyone. We're spiking oil prices. Revolution has collateral damage. Yeah, but who's the collateral? You wanna burn it down in an hour? It takes like a lifetime to build something new. I'm not tryin' to rebuild anything. Everything's spinning. It'll pass. It never does. Are you scared? Uh, yeah. Are you? No. I love you so much. I love you, too. Come on, go to sleep. Thanks for keeping your cool tonight, man. You know, I'm worried about the others. If we can't keep them focused... Goodnight, Michael. Whoa! Whoa, whoa! What the fuck do you think you're doing? This isn't your land! You can't block the road! Are you crazy? You're on my property! Go home! Whatever that thing is. Yeah, just put it, like, right in front of them, kinda cocked a little towards me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that. - That good? - Yeah, there we go. Much better. Yeah, it feels more lived in. Okay, let's roll. Sound speed. Okay, so..., I guess, um... In your own words, tell us what happened. Um... Tried to stop a pipeline from being built on my property. Poisons the air, water, ruins crops, kills cattle. We had a baby on the way, so I tried to fight 'em in court and they kept using the, um, they kept using the... Imminent domain. - Imminent domain... - Imminent domain. Domain excuse. Government seizure of private property for public use. Yeah, sure. That property had been in my family for over a hundred years. I wasn't gonna let anybody take it from me, so... Okay, so, take me back to that moment, being forced to leave. That powerlessness. Uh, I don't... I don't know if I wanna go there. Well, it's important. For what? We're trying to put a human face on this crisis. It helps. I mean, this is our lives. We lost our home. We had to move in with my mom. We got thousands in legal bills. Are y'all gonna help with that? Oh, I wish we could, but we... we're an organization telling stories, - raising awareness. It... - You wanna help? Why don't you go out and get me a new .45. I got some names for you. Dwayne. Excuse me? Let's wrap this shit up. So fuckin' annoying. Yeah, I'm sorry. What? Come here. Come on. I'm sorry. It's gonna be okay, all right? - I'm so tired. - I know. Oh, goddamn it. Did you forget to test your blood sugar? Oh, my gosh. - You got it? - Yeah. Hello? Hey. - You forget somethin'? - Who is it? - It's the guy from the movie. - No, no, I just... Tell him to screw off. No, I'm... I'm sorry about earlier. I just, I... I came alone. Listen, um... the movie sucks. The only reason that I decided to join was so I could meet people like you. What do you mean, people like me? You know, people who live out here... people who know the land... people who wanna fight. I think there's a way to do it without spillin' any oil. Right here. Use this valve station to shut off the oil flow. Inside the fence, we gotta turn this wheel, and just down the road from there... I'm gonna put her down. Okay. And then the first site's about a mile away from there. Right here, underground pipe, top of the hill. And we could blow the pipe at the hilltop, and the oil will stay in. You think it's got enough altitude? Yeah, I've done the readings myself. Now, the second bomb site's about two miles down the road from there. Hundred and fifty feet of elevated pipe. That's lucky for us 'cause most of the pipe is underground, but on site, there's an old coal mine, so they had to pop it up. Now, if we blow the pipe in the middle, then, slope on either side will keep the oil from leakin'. Yeah, I scouted this for five weeks and there's no way we would find all three anywhere else. Mom's back in 45. Can I get y'all a beer or somethin'? Oh yeah, thank you. Just water for me, please. Oh, we're outta water. Then, beer is great, thanks. So... when we plant the bomb and clear the area, we have to make sure that two people are at the valve station to shut off the active oil flow. That way, we can detonate it. And what are these bombs made of? Somethin' like the equivalent of 600 sticks of dynamite? What if y'all do structural damage? Structural damage is kinda the point. They'll spin anything smaller as an accident, so two bombs. Right, we have to make oil unviable in the marketplace. The shock of our explosion will make it so the JDIA has to reinspect miles of pipe. If they can't move oil, they can't sell it. What? We ain't gonna spill more oil than what leaks on normal business hours. Right, but Dwayne, we live here. Katie, we talked about this, okay? It's gonna be fine, I'll take care of it. Okay? Yeah... this is gonna fucking work. Oh, God. Here's some breakfast. - Any coffee? - There's some instant coffee. It's out on the genny. - Up, now. Come on. - God! I'm dying. Hey, how much time? About 20 minutes. How are you feeling? Good. You? Good. Good. Your turn. Fuck, I'm gonna fucking die right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you say that every morning. - Fuck you. - And you never do. All right... last chance. Anybody want out? Shawn? Nah, I'm good. Well... Very proud of all of you. Thanks, man. It's just nerves, don't worry. I'm fine. Man, you better not hit any potholes. Theo. - Hey. - Yeah? - We got this. - We got this. Oh shit. Okay, twist it out. Guys, this is bulk explosive. Let's try not to drop it. This is good. - Ready? - Nice and easy. - Nice and easy. - Yep. Help me with this. - Okay. That's right. - Got it. Is somebody gonna get under? Yeah, we're under it, - we're under it. - I got it, I got it. Under? Okay. You guys got all this? Yeah, yeah. Okay, I gotta let go. - Oh, shit. - Fuck. Fuck. Couldn't have made a lighter barrel? - Wait. - One... Two, three. - One. - Two. Three. Got it? One, two, three. Get the motherfucker. Fuck. - All right. - Oh fuck. All right, Jesus Christ. - Oh shit. - You good? Yeah, yeah. Slow down, slow down. It's tipping, it's tipping. Wait! Wait! - What? - What? - Over there. - What? - Fuck! - What is that? I think it's a surveying drone. What's it doing? Lower the fucking barrel. Probably using LiDAR to detect erosion. We gotta hurry the fuck up. What does it matter? Just lower it into the fucking hole! We gotta hurry. Well, is it gonna see us? - Don't panic. - I mean, it'll see this big ass fuckin' barrel. We gotta get outta here. Don't panic. Just slowly. Guys I'm about to drop. - Okay, okay. - Slowly. Come on, come on, come on. I'm clear. Xochitl? Clear. Okay, okay, okay, okay, drop. Oh shit. What do I do with it? Just leave it. We don't want them to track us. Wait, so did it get us on video? No, it just scans metal. - Shawn? - What do you need? - Woo! - Caps. - Okay. - Good job, everyone. - Careful with 'em. - Yeehaw, buddy. That was hot. This is live ETN. Everybody stand back. Don't blow us up, Michael. Shut the fuck up. Okay. Let's do this shit. Okay. Come on. Fuck. Your wire doesn't fucking reach, Shawn. Gonna have to tuck it. Fuck me. Get up here. Good work with the wires, Shawn. - Thanks. - Yeah, good job. All right, we are out. Hitting 107? Yep, we got it! - Good luck! - We don't need it. Cool. Thanks. That smell. Just like home. One, two, three. One, two, three. - Ready? - One, two, three. - Yup. - All right. One, two, three. Ready? One, two, three. - All right. - Fuck. All right, I got the strap. - All right. - Hang on, hang on. What's the test strength on these? Plenty. All right, gentle, just like the first time. Yeah, only a lot fucking harder. I'll get a strap. - Okay. - Hold that. - Shawn, you got it? - All right, Dwayne, go to the back. - Ready? - All good. Okay, okay, okay. - Okay. - One... - Ready, set, pull. - You go. Yep, yes, we are. Good. Do you have any water left? Yep. Thanks. - Good? - Yeah. Cool. Oh fuck. There it is. Wow! Holy shit. Fuck. Look at that fucking ugly thing. It smells like shit. It smells. Okay. There's a lock. - Wow. - Bolt cutters? Oh, shit. - What? - Dude. Oh, man. Rest in peace, bud. Rest in peace. Fucking valve. All right, bolt cutters, please. I think we should just wait to trespass until we really have to. No, you're right, you're right. Three, two, one, go! Three, two, one, go! Three, two, one, go! Come on, come on. - Three, two, one, go! - Pull, pull, pull! You got it. Go, again! Go! You got it, you got it! - Come on! - Three, two, one! Wait, wait, guys. Guys, my strap. Don't stop. I think it's fraying! Don't fuckin' stop. - Hey, I think... - It's fine, it's fine. Just pull it! - I think it's... - Don't fucking stop! Guys, I think it's... Let's go! Please come dancing with me tonight? Come on. What about something low-key? I got some nice wine... I told you I feel fine, so you have to come. I don't know, haven't you been feeling, you know... Come on. I think we should just have a nice night in, you know, we can cook something. Shit. - Theo, you okay? - No, I'm fine. Just a little... Theo? Hello? Theo? I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just... No, what just happened? Theo? Chronic myeloid leukemia. It's very rare. But there are clusters of people who grew up near chemical plants, oil refineries. Your condition... is already at an advanced stage. Okay, well, can't I just like sign up with you? Jesus fucking Christ. I need these pills to live and you're telling me to get fucking coupons? Yeah, thanks. Fuck! Hey. How you feeling? You okay? Fine. Nice haircut. Thank you. I saw the GoFundMe. How you feeling? You know, makin' peace with the Lord. You didn't call. You don't always pick up. Fair enough. Just fucking with you. It's fine. You were busy. Not anymore. Dropped out. You dropped out? Why? 'Cause fuck that. Xochitl... that sucks. You left, you... No. Theo, listen. You have your phone on you? Yeah. Turn it off. There you go. Enjoy. Hey, y'all. Just so you know, we are really low on supplies, so we're not gonna be serving for the rest of the week. We're all really, really sorry. - Hey. - Oh! You're up and about. Yeah, I wanted to come by and help. You sure you're okay? Xochitl said what? Can't believe she even asked. Well, what did you say? It's a dope idea. No, it's crazy. I don't know, fixing shit in a system built by oppressors is kinda crazy. Oh my God, you sound just like her. Theo, Xochitl's just another girl that went to college, read a book, and decided she knows how to save the world. That's so unfair. You know what she's been through. We've all been through it. But you wanna help people? Help people. That's easy for you to say, you're not from here. Theo, you're not... You're not actually thinking... I'm not thinking about it. I'm doing it. You don't get it. How do I not get it? I'm literally in it with you every single day. - Excuse us. - Hey. Look, when I was a kid, Xochitl and I used to go out and dance in the rain 'cause that's just what kids do. And every time we did, the rain would burn the shit out of my skin. I'd go inside covered in little red welts all over my neck and arms. So yeah, you don't get it. I love you, but I have to do this. I have to go out with one big "fuck you" to the people who did this to me. - Fuck! - Are you okay? - Get it off! Get it off! - Shit, are you okay? Get it off. It's alright. - It's gonna be okay. - I'm just gonna turn it, okay? There we go, there we go. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Just breathe, just breathe, it's gonna be okay. It's broken. Okay. Shawn, I need two sticks about the same size as her shin now, please. We-we can't have any evidence, any blood, DNA, nothing. - I fucking know, Xochitl! - Fuck. You're gonna be okay, all right? - You're gonna be okay. - Here, just hold my hand. Hold my hand. That's pretty good, thank you, yeah. All right. Okay, all right. - Here, here, here. - It's okay. Just breathe, just breathe. Just breathe, don't look at it, okay? Don't look at it. Just gonna put this on nice and gently, okay? Here, just hold my hand. - Hold my hand. - Gonna be okay. There you go. You're doing great. Doing great. - What the fuck is this, huh? - I don't fucking know. I told you it was fraying. Like 20 times... Just breathe through it. - I tried to stop you. - Just breathe through it. And what did you do? You kept going. It's gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay. Right, Dwayne? Can we just leave the bomb under the pipe? Will that work? If you wanna blow a hole in the ground, then yeah, sure. Well then, what the fuck do we do? Why don't we just braid it? Braid what? - The... - The strap. God. The fuck is taking them so long? Everything's fine. It's all gonna be fine. Come on, come on, you got this. All right, we're ratcheting. You guys got this! Fuck, fuck, fuck. All right! That should hold, that should hold. Good work, buddy. Here, try this. Ooh! That good? It's gonna be okay. We're almost there. Oh fuck. Oh my God, fuck. Babe, feel my heart. This is big. This is big. This-This is big.uge. This is the biggest thing anyone's ever fucking done. - Everybody mark on three? - Yeah. Yeah? One, two... Thanks. You wanna help me get her in? All right, babe, we're gonna lift. On three. One, two, three. I know, I know. Hey, you good? Yeah. - You good? - Yeah. Can't believe we actually did this. Not yet. Xochitl. You'll be great. You, too. Merry Christmas. Xochitl, let's go! How much time do you think we have? - Thirty-eight minutes. - Thirty-eight? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Oh fuck. That's so hot. - How are you doing? You okay? - She needs to go to a hospital. The cameras have her at work right now. We can't. Have you seen her leg? Yes, but she needs an alibi, Theo. Okay, but you heard what Dwayne said. She could be bleeding out or... Okay, if I have to go pick up Michael and Shawn, then I have to clean right now. No, I think I can do it. - Alisha. - Look, Xochitl's right. I need an alibi, so... I'll drive. Are you sure? Yeah. Here. Ed, Stevie. Oh hey, Dwayne. You look like shit. I'm diggin' a new septic tank. Why, you volunteerin' to help? No thanks. Yeah, I didn't think so. Thank you. It's two o'clock. You got the game on? TV's broke. Goddamn useless. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Motherfucker. Hey, Charlene, this is Hank. Yeah, we got it. It's showin' up now, but it ain't movin'. So something's gone pear-shaped. Yeah, we got the coordinates now. We're gonna check it out. Exactly. Serves 'em right for replacin' us with a goddamn robot. Okay. Yeah, you take care. Earl, come on. Where are we headed? - Yeah, not quite sure yet. - Shit, Logan. The drone. - What? - The drone. Either they're gonna find the bomb or they're gonna... Okay. Fuck them. - Logan. - What? They're part of the problem, Rowan. We are not fucking murderers. Fuck, fine. Okay, stay here. What? I don't know, bud. The towers are over there. There it is, about a mile and a half to the north. Yeah, looks about right. You hear that? You got some old ass tires. It looks like they got cut. What in the hell? We're gonna have to call it in. Yeah. - What are you doing? - Hey! Somebody's fuckin' with us. They cut the phone. I'm gonna run. What? Show your face, shitheel! I'm gonna run. You're gonna do the valve. - I was all-state, bitch. - No, you weren't. - I was close. - You're on JDIA property. - You weren't. - I know. I know. I'll meet you at the car, okay? Okay, okay. Be careful. - There! - Hey! Stop or I'll shoot! Hey! You little shit! Fuck. Freeze! Stop right there! Suck my dick. I get it, you know. I do. I do. I get what it's like to... come from nothing, and to feel like the only way forward is just to burn it all down. One screw up like this shouldn't destroy your life, Rowan, but it will. We mess up, we fall in with the wrong people. Well, I'm not with anyone. Oh! really? Nope. This is destruction of critical infrastructure on federal property. Terrorism. The best a lawyer's gonna get you is 15 years. And that's if you plead out. You have a lot of promise and it's all going to go to waste. Or, we can work together. Hey, Ro. Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, Ro, you okay? I got fucked. Wait, how did you get out so quick? Rowan. Rowan, what the fuck happened? I handled it, okay? What do you mean? I handled it. I just wanna go home. Wait, what did they charge you with? I just really wanna go. Rowan, what the fuck did you do? Rowan! They were bluffing, though. - No, they weren't. - Yes, they fucking were. Do you care about any of this? This is what you signed up for. Yes, I care. And it's way harder when I don't have a family lawyer on standby. Fuck you. Yeah, you're good at pretending you would've done things differently in there, but we both know you would've never had to make that decision. I never would have called my dad's lawyer. Yeah, but the point is that you could have. Who the fuck are you? I am your fucking partner. Do you want me to rot in prison for 15 years? No. No, I don't want you to fucking rot. I fucking love you. You know I love you. I'm just, I'm not gonna let you rat on our friends. What am I supposed to do? Maybe we find somebody else. Yeah, no, it's pretty messed up this year. World is ending. Yeah, yeah, kinda how it feels. You know, it's like... Shit show. Hey, could you close the door? The AC is on. That's got some good shit. Doesn't teach you how to do it, though. Oh yeah? Yeah. Is this for school or somethin'? Nah, I just wanna learn. Might be headed to Texas for the winter. What's in Texas? Just a project. Might be looking for some collaborators. What kinda project? Us against the world, babe. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey! - Hey! What's good, Shawn? Hello. What's up? How you doin'? - Good. - Flannel. - Hey. - What's your name? Xochitl. Good to meet ya, Xoch. You wanna come see a band play? Give it up, ya little shit! Just get the motherfucker! Hey, Slim. Another round over here, please. That time? Yup. You okay? Mm-hmm. Go up. You sure? Yeah. Xochitl, I'm comin' up. We got green! One, two, three, four, five, six. What the fuck was that? Logan! Logan! Fuck. Fuck. - Rowan, they fuckin' shot me. - No, no, no, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. Fuck. Oh fuck. Lean on the car, lean on the car, lean on the car. Oh, my God. Just bottles? Bottles, chips, anything with DNA on it needs to go home with Alisha. Here's a bottle. You sure you're good to drive? Yeah, I'm good. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you. Uh, Xochitl, take care of her. Got it? Yeah. Want me to drive? No, I'm good. You sure? Yeah. I've got another foot. Come on, Michael. Goin' hard today. Well, you know I got a... little toddler at home. Hey, Slim. Bud and a shot. Comin' at ya. What the hell's goin' on out there? Heard an explosion. Someone blew that pipeline half to hell. Then what in God's name are you doin' in here? Ain't supposed to discuss an ongoin' investigation... but I think they already caught the fuckers. The Feds told us to wait until needed, and I sure ain't waitin' sober. Well, the next round's on me, then. Appreciate ya. Fuck! - I'll see ya there. - Got this? It's okay, I'll be right back. Okay. Okay. Fuck. Alright. Fuck. Okay, how are we gonna do this? Just pull me up. Fuck! You still have dirt on your face. Right. All right, let's go. Don't move! Don't move! Be fucking still! I can't... Logan. Last step, last step. Okay. Last step. Last step. It's okay. You did so good. Okay, please don't leave me. - I don't wanna die. - I'll be right back, okay? Don't leave me. I told Logan I went out for a pack of cigs. Do you wanna tell me what the fuck just happened? - Be careful. - I'm being careful, dude. Fuck. What? Um... Get me a candle from the other room. Michael fucked up the seal. Did you lie to me? No, no I didn't. I promise. They just told me a whole different story, and by the time that I realized it was happening... Bullshit. Hang on, I have... I have everything you need right here. Photos, text messages, and the address. And so, if you go right now, you're still gonna get them. And what about Logan? He's three days into a bender. He doesn't know what's up. It's Rhodes. It's 1643, County Road 13. What's going on? You're gonna ride with us until this all works out. Or do you have somewhere else to be? Four interceptions and they leave him in the game. Come on. His momma can throw better than that. Amen. All units, all units, report to 1634, County Road 13. Copy that. On my way. Oh! All right, y'all. You be careful out there. Man, those fuckers are fast. Good. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Right there. Okay. - Steady, steady. - Mm-hmm. Okay. - Okay. - Ready? Yeah. Like this? Perfect. It was nice knowing you, dude. You, too. Frequency mode. Seven, eight, nine... I hear you in there, Xochitl. Give me one reason not to turn your ass in to the police right now. Please, just come in. An informant, Xochitl? Are you fucking kidding me? I trust her. Of course, you work with a cop. She's not a cop. She's a 22-year-old kid who got fucked over. She coulda turned us in, but she came clean. This was her idea. Rowan feeds the FBI exactly what we need her to so they catch us in the act on site with evidence. The FBI gets to be the hero that caught the big, bad terrorists. They really just wanna look good. You and Theo are gonna spend the rest of your lives in prison. Maybe. Two girls from a refinery town, one with terminal cancer. - That's sympathetic. - Oh my God. That's relatable. We have a right to defend ourselves. We could set a new legal precedent, and if we get off, more people follow, more bombs happen, fossil fuel gets priced out of the market. People are out there doing the work and you just wanna come in and say, "Fuck you"? This flashy shit is pure ego. Okay, yeah. That work is important, and it's not fucking working. You need leverage. The flashy shit scares people. Okay, so you scare some oil companies, but you're really gonna fuck over poor people. Pay more for gas now. Or choke to death on hot air in five years. Who are you to decide? You're not God, Xochitl. You don't get to decide how people live and die. Better me than the people that are currently doing that. And Alisha, you are the one trying to decide how Theo lives or dies, and I'm really sorry, I hate to say it, but we both know she's gonna die. I'm sorry. That was... harsh. Everyone just... just acts like she has nothing to lose... but I'm here. It's not fucking fair. I've lost people, too. I don't want you to lose Theo any sooner than you have to. But she's my best friend, too, and I know that she needs to do this. We can protect you, we can get you a good alibi. Even if I wanted to, there'd be fingerprints, DNA, hair. We can clean that up. That would take days. Well... Get down We're unarmed! We are unarmed! Get down on the ground! - We're surrendering peacefully! - Put your hands on your head! - We're unarmed! - Get down on the ground! Don't fuckin' move. - We surrender peacefully! - Don't you fuckin' move! - Do not move! - Hey, don't hurt her! Don't fucking hurt her! Logan? Logan? Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah? We did it. What? What the fuck is that? She bought it. She thinks it was just me, Theo, and Xochitl. She fucking paid you? Yeah. We're in the clear? - Yeah. - I'm in the clear? - Yeah. - Everyone's in the clear? I didn't fuck up? No. Are you sure I didn't fuck up? Yeah, you didn't fuck up. It's live. Rowan, it's live. My name is Xochitl Fuentes. If you're seeing this, then I've just blown up a section of JDIA oil pipeline. Destroying this property was a last resort. We fucking did it. If we want to survive, we must damage and dismantle CO2-emitting devices, demolish them, burn them, blow them up. Let those who profit from mass death know their properties will be trashed. They will defame us and claim this was violence or vandalism, but this was justified. This was an act of self-defense. blow them up.
