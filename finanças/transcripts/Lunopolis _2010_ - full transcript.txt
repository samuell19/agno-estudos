Despite the rapid loss of water, miraculously, no one was hurt. Engineers are still investigating the cause of the collapse, with no clear answers yet. In tech news tonight, Ron Weatherbee has further developments in the story of an unusual piece of video that surfaced on the internet last week. The images seen in the footage that swept worldwide across the internet in a single day, are still leaving experts scratching their heads over what appears to be a supernatural event captured on tape. While many believe it depicts the end of the world or extinction level cataclysmic event, others believe it may be connected with secret factions of world government, as yet undisclosed. The video was removed from the internet as quickly as it appeared, but not before being seen and downloaded by millions of viewers over the span of merely 24 hours. Determining it's authenticity has ignited much debate, and raised hundreds of questions. As for the answers, we will probably never truly know. Ron Weatherbee, BTV News London. Though many claim to believe it's truly a supernatural phenomenon, most have written it off as nothing more than just another simple internet hoax. It's sixteen past the hour, we'll be right back after this. This is a most unusual story. You may choose to believe it if you wish, or you may choose to remain a skeptic. It is the diary of 12 days in the lives of two men, who may very well have changed the world forever. Since discovering these materials, I have been able to piece together a timeline, from the footage that was left behind. And though, most unfortunately they were not able to complete their film, I truly believe that this is the story, they intended to tell. Okay, you rolling? today is December... (voice off camera) Ninth. December ninth, 2012 I'm Matt, this is Sonny, today on camera are Nate, say hi Nate... And Sarah and Arte... actuallyArte is not running camera, he's our guide. He's a good friend of mine, he runs the boatshop here, he's got the boats, and he's taking us out. What we're dong today is we're following some numbers. Actually we came out last week, we found some GPS coordinates that we wanted to go and scope out. We went out there, there was an old houseboat with a trapdoor in the floor, that opened up into this area... we don't really know yet. We want to explore. and we were really too unprepared to go down last week so we came back out this week... to go down the hole. Yeah, to see what's down there. the reason that this came about, is because of this picture that we received- (Matt interrupts0 Tell them about the radio show first- (Sonny0 Well yeah, you're right. We know this guy George Larson who has this radio show, it's like a weekly syndicated thing, and he deals with freaks, supernatural stuff, conspiracy theories, weirdos... paranormal stuff, yeah, stuff like that. He gives us materials thats the reason we know him. he gives us materials to look at. People give him these weird photos of ghosts, and he tries to get us to authenticate it. This all started when George got an interesting call on his show one night. Open mic night, not unusual to have strange calls. But this one guy called and he sounded really frantic, and worried and had kind of interesting things to say. (Host) So let's take another call. (Host) Hello, you're on Beyond the Outer Reach. (Host) Hello? (Host) What is your name? (Host) Okay sir, what is it that you have to say? Tell me. (Host) Wait... I'm sorry sir... (Host) ...So there are people on the moon? (Host) People from the moon are here in the United States? (Host) This sounds to me like you're describing the Roswell incident. (Host) So we went to the moon because we were looking for civilizations up there? (Host) What did you say? (Hushed whisper) (Host) Sir? (Call cut off) (Host) Sir? Are you still there? George thought it was hoax, until the photo album showed up. When the photo album showed up he got us to look at it, and there were some really bizarre photos in this photo album, but the one picture that really stood out though was a polaroid Not just because of what was in the polaroid, because the guy that was in the polaroid, the subject- was a very weird looking individual. He was unlike anybody I've ever seen. This guy was in modern dress. He was bald. He had a blank, vacant expression on his face, sunken in, very weird looking guy. But the thing is it was a very old book, very old picture but he's in modern day clothes. The whole thing seemed like present day, but it was really, really old. And that didn't make any sense. ...especially since you can't fake a Polaroid picture. As we're investigating this polaroid, we discovered, on the back of it, some numbers and as we researched what the numbers were, we finally realized they were GPS coordinates. And it just so happens, we're near where those GPS coordinates lead. They point right here. We live less than 40 miles away from where the coordinates directed us to. So we thought that was kind of weird. So how could we not come out here, and see what we were gonna find I mean who knows what's down there. We're gonna find out. We're braving it. We're toughing the dark abyss. Following the coordinates was the first of many regrets. The album that they received was highly questionable. It contained aerial photographs of the Louisiana River Delta area, from 1898. The Wright Brothers first flight was not until 1903, five years later. This needed to be explained. (Matt) Okay we're out at the location now but we have a problem. The water is 2 feet higher than it was last time. Do we have an option at all of coming back in the next couple of weeks when the water will be lower? No, it's not gonna fall that fast even if it does go down. So we're just going to go pull up some floorboards, yeah we're going and gain access to it, not from the hatch, but we're gonna pull up a couple of boards in the middle, and we're going to try and gain access to it from there. Excellent. Aw hell yeah. This last board right here and we can fit in this thing. It's dry down there? Yeah. Oh yeah... Let's do this. I knew it man! That's great. So you guys are seriously going down there? Yeah. Yeah! (laughter) That's what we're here for, we came out here for this purpose. Oh yeah I'm going down. We got to. I'm going down. So you just gotta go? We gotta do it. Okay! (laughter) So, flashlights and glowsticks! Yeah actually they're still in the boat. Hmm. Every little thing I touch, I think is a bug. (whispering) So this is where they run their power. (whispering) Big time. What the hell are they doing down here with all this juice? (buzzing) You can hear it. I feel like Andy Dufresne. (laughing) No shit. I had no idea we'd be.... Yeah, just keep going that way. Nail. Nail. Watch the nails. Careful guys. This is a small ass space. Why are we doing this? We keep asking that. Um... Because... why not? I mean this stuff just fell in our laps. We didn't know what to make of it, and it's compelling. I don't know. I mean I want to know if something is going on out there, under our faces that we're not paying attention to, or can't see. And I don't know anything. Right? I mean... We don't have anything but this picture, and the numbers, and some crazy moon story. So I don't know... Is it foolish to pursue any clue that maylead to a hidden truth? Or is it foolish not to? I mean look where we're at. Right? I mean... I suppose nothing could happen or come of this, but something very well could. So we're here. And we're going to catch it if it does. Now there you go. Wait a minute... (metallic sounds) Open it! I'm trying to figure out how. It's magnetically sealed? No. No.. hold on. No. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck it. There's like a bell on it... Woah, woah, you got it? Yep. Shit. It's an elevator? It's not going. Maybe if you close the door and turn iton it'll.... Aw shit. (motor whirring) Whoa, Sonny! Sonny! Shit. Shit. Shit. (motor noise) (from inside) Coming back up! You still there man? (from inside) Yeah. Yeah he's in there. You alright? Yeah. It went way down. Where did it go? It went further down? Fuck further down, we're not going further down. There's no up? No there's no up. Further down!? Yes. (rumbling sounds) (rumbling sounds) We might be exceeding the weight limiton this thing. (rumbling sounds) You think there's a weightlimit on something like this? (rumbling sounds) Yeah. (rumbling sounds) (low, windy gusts) Hey I found a switch! Serious? Yeah. Where? Right here. Hang on let me see it. You gonna flip it? Uh, yeah. Go for it. Alright. Whatlit up? Did something happen? Yeah, over there. It's down there all by itself. What is that? It's some handmade contraption or something. It does look like a bomb. Yeah it does. Don't touch it! Okay I'm going to drop something on it. Okay. (metalic ping) Alright then. (laughter) Oh that's all you needed huh? The chapstick didn't electrocute. It's okay so we can touch it now eh? Fuck. Great. It's not attached to anything. No. Out in the middle of nowhere. This is like.... It's like a power source. Wait what? This thing looks like a power switch. This red thing here- Oooh don't do that. (smack) (laughing) don't even... Jesus... So what is it? I'd say it's a prototype by the shitty look.... (distant noise) SSSHHH!! (distant eerie sounds) I say we take this thing and we go. Take it? (distant noise) Whoah. (whispers0 I keep hearing the weirdest noises. I'm telling you. Yeah, you heard that too? Yes! Okay I don't know what this is, but this is not cool. It's the only thing here, it's gotta be important. Yeah that's why we don't take it with us man, it's the only thing here. Exactly. You wanna carry that thing back through that two foot space? Yeah, I'll carry it back. And we gotta go! Can you pick it up? Can you even pick that up? Try it. Aw yeah dude. Look. Oh, it's not attached to that base. Hah. We take it. Alright, I'll...volunteer to.... (loud noise) Oh shit! What's that sound? Come on, let's get the fuck outof here! C'mon. Not without this. Come on. YOU carry it. Yeah I got it. Come on. Come on! Let me get that! There's the other glow stick. Yeah! That's the way we came! (distant noise) That was Sonny. Was that Sonny? Where did Sonny go? I'm right here. It wasn't me dude. Oh shit! Oh my fucking god! Run! Run! Start the fucking boat!! Get up! Come on man! Damn it. Get out!! Go, go, go! Get this thing going. Get on the boat! Wait, wait, wait... What's going on? Go!! Just GO! SIT, SIT! What about the other boat! What's up man? Jesus. My..my hands were shaking so bad... Whoah.. Man I wasn't even... I was faced the other way... What the hell are people doing down in the freaking... In a warehouse, underwater! This was an emergency exit. I mean they didn't get all of that shit down there through that. Yeah, you're right. That's an emergency exit. That must mean there are people that stay down there, constantly. What is that? What? Polaroid? Two Polaroids. Polaroid cameras... and a book... and some shit. How can you tell if there's film in this? Say cheese. Cheeeeeese. No shit? Aw shit. Yeah. Yeah, it worked. It's got film in it. What the fuck? This is uh... That's where we just were. Yeah, there's Butte Larose... Wow. What else is in that fucking box man? Got some instruction manuals here. For what? Physics major shit right here. Uh, I promise you it's for that right there. I mean look they even drew a picture of it, and at some point there was something that looked like that piece on the back. And a series of procedures for power up. And Polaroids- And Polaroid cameras. And the numbers in the photo album, were on the old Polaroid. I don't even know what this is, but this just seems to be how to turn it on. So I say we give it a shot! Turn it on? Yeah... Like... Oh my god look at this thing dude! Yeah buddy! Oh my god... what does it do? Uh, look it connects... No not that, the machine. I mean, we can flip the switch but there's no power supply, so I don't think- Whoah! Dude, what happened? Hang on, hang on... What the fuck was that? I have no idea, but I wasn't expecting that shit! Once we hit the second one, just be ready. Alright I'm hitting the first switch... Oh my god dude are you kidding me? Scarier than sky diving. Alright you ready Nate? Yeah. Hit the other one. Hit the other one! Ready? Yeah! Aw shit! Whoah that's too loud man! If you want to do it, do it! Alright ready? Here goes... (choking) get this thing off of me! Go ahead... So... we've had an interesting last couple of days ...the last couple of days to say the least. Did some time in the hospital. Electrocution, sprained wrist... No burns. Yeah, no burns. So we decided we're gonna to take the machine to somebody who's a little more professional... and maybe figure out what the hell it is. Yeah, someone who may know what they're talking about. We know this professor guy, Professor Raymond. We're going to take it to him, to see what he has to say about it. Hey Doctor Raymond! Hey! How are ya? We catching you at a bad time? No, no not at all. I... Hello Sonny. Hi. We have uh- I think you might be interested in this thing. My god... Five minutes. When we hit the switches, I really don't know what happened after that. A light came... Were you knocked out? . Yes. Yes, here's what happened... This... as soon as we hit that last switch it kind of made this noise. We all backed up alittle bit... And then this thing goes- Don't touch it. I won't it just... Light kind of emitted from it like a pulse... but the thing is that before that happened, he kind of disappeared for about, 5 seconds. He, disappeared? As in vanished completely. Uh, where did it come from? An old building that we found it in. and...just like this, lying there? Pretty much. Do you remember the sequence you pushed... This one first. Yeah we started with this one up here- That's the initiator Then we went to this one- Okay, the interface. Then we went to the one on the front, right? The one on the center? Yeah. Yes. Okay, so what does this one do? Holy shit. Did that just come out of there? Don't touch it, don't touch it. What is that? That's... I don't know. Is that a diamond? I don't know what it is. But I want to find out. Ya know, I've looked at the optics, I've looked at the mineralogy. This isn't pure... but the primary mineral in here, is called Armalcolite. Thank god. I mean at least it's found on earth, right? No, not exactly. It's not found on earth at all there's only one place that we know of where this stuff is found. The moon? Good guess. Somebody's on a bike there with Sonny. What is it? I don't know, Jehova's Witness? Well I guess we should probably help him out. We've gotta getout of here anyway. Have a blessed day! Have a blessed day? What did he say? What did he say to you? Have a blessed day? He was a little more nosey with me, that motherfucker was asking all sorts of questions. What are you doing here? What's the cameras? What the fuck is the machine? Like, he was asking about that- He was asking about the machine? Yeah and then I asked him 'Look, what the fuck do you want'? And he just said 'here, have a blessed day'. The Church of Lunology. The Church of Lunology? And so it began, that two brothers, bore of the same spirit but divided in two, were given dominion over the universe all that is, ever was, or ever shall be. and it would come to pass that they were divided, yet still in full harmony with all being. They were opposite, so the same. They were contrary, so in agreement. They occupied both the lightness, and the dark, and from each other was their strength, so never could they be apart. But only could one destroy the other, and the other destroy one. Thus ending all things. The words are directly from the scriptures of our original founder of the Church of Lunology, J. Ari Hilliard. The book, entitled the 'Holy Lunar Testament'- For only $49.95! This is crazy it was published in 1940 and instantly achieved critical acclaim. Today the Church of Lunology has become the fastest growing religion in the world. Oh, look out! That's like a business. The fastest growing business in the world... That you've never heard of! Yeah! And I'm still on hold over here. Really? Yeah, these people don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. This is insane. ...guys on bikes man. The repeated connections to the moon could not be ignored. It was their first clue that something bigger might be happening, and their first brush with the elusive and bizarre, Church of Lunology. An organization that began with basement cult meetings, and although a much larger organization today, many of the smaller groups, still operate that way. There are people on the moon, they're from the future, and they're running our government. I have seen the pictures. Well, I've seen pictures too and I don't think- No, you've seen pictures. I have seen THE pictures. Well how do you know they are real? They are there, trust me. They could be on a Hollywood set. Where are they now? Where are these pictures now? I want to see them. I don't have them in my possession but I have seen them. There are people in this country who do know about this. But, they are hard to find. But trust me, trust me... How can you expect us to believe? There is an old saying that we use... Be careful what you ask for, you just may get it! Well I was at Langley Air Force Base. I was a pretty young guy, pretty gung-ho, like all of us were back then. And I had a buddy working in the photo lab there, and one day he said 'hey, come by and take a look around. see what we do' and I went in there to look around. and he was showing me these composites of the surface of the moon they were like mosaics. And I'm just looking at them, I really wasn't sure what I was seeing. You know, I was just a sergeant. And he said, 'I found structures on the surface of the moon'. And I said, structures? What do you mean structures? I looked down at it, and there was the stuff laid out and you could see exactly what he said was there. He told me that what they would do, in the lab they would take these mosaics, these composites of the surface of the moon, and they would paint over them. And I asked, 'why would you guys do this? This is big information this is a great story. He just said 'orders'. The news media receives hundreds of calls every year related to the people on the moon. It's become somewhat of a joke in certain circles. It's just something that cannot be taken seriously. And nobody wants to be the one, who took this story seriously, when it was all just a big joke. and then on the other end of the spectrum, is a strong silent voice working very hard to keep any such matters outof the media altogether, and that is the Church of Lunology. The Church of Lunology is a cult, there's no doubt about it. They do exist, but with an overwhelming veil of secrecy. An encounter with them is a threatening experience. You don't want to piss these people off. Is this it? Yeah, this is it buddy. Looks a kinda run down. Looks a lot rundown. It's not whatl was expecting. Well, that's it though. How do we get in? Entrance. Oh yeah, duh. You know what Nathan? What's up? Why don't you grab a couple of quick shots outside real quick? We'll go in see what this is all about, you can just get some exteriors or something. Alright. Whew. It's uh... it's warm in here. There can't be anybody in here. I wouldn't think there's anybody in here at all. The lady gave me this address last night. Yeah, but obviously no one has used this in a while. Oh, look at this window, it's like an old hospital door. That's kind of cool. Whoah, shit. Hey, hello..? Y'all saw somebody right? Yeah I just saw it. They must still work out here. No way! Yeah that sucks. I'd hate to have this job. Yeah everything is falling down, it's moldy, it stinks... it smells like piss in here. Hello? We got a stairway. If somebody is working here I don't want to walk in right in the middle of their shit- Sshh! I heard something. Is the door open up there? Go check! Yeah this is dark. I know we saw someone... yeah where else did they go? Is it open? Yeah. This looks just like the downstairs floor. Look at this place. This is a neat old building but I can't believe that anybody would still work here. You definitely saw somebody right? No, no I saw a guy. There's somebody here. They just work in the crappiest environment ever. No shit, huh? I put it in the GPS, this was the right address, I know that for certain. Whoah, shit! No, you scared the fuck out of me! What are you guys doing here? What are YOU doing here? Thanks. Just getting some footage. This building. Just for alittle project we're working on. Am I hiding something? What's my secret? Look I'm going to need you to turn that camera off. Who are you? That's not important. I need you to turn the camera off. Now. No, I'm notgonna turn the camera off, are you joking? Why don't you turn the fucking camera off. Who is that? Who are these people, who are you? Don't worry about that. You need to turn the camera off and get out of here, right now. No I'm notgonna turn the camera off, dude what is this!? Sir I'm sorry, we called yesterday. We thought somebody was expecting us here. We're here just shooting some video, we didn't actually- No, I think there's alittle more to it than that. Where is what? WHERE IS IT? ...where is what? What? What the fuck are you talking about? Where is it? Hmm. No, let's go. No, you're not going anywhere. I'm sorry, we didn't mean to be trespassing or anything, butl don't know what you're talking about and please back up. Under the ship? Under the ship! Are you fucking stupid!? Give it back! Hey! Hey! Hey! Y'all need to stop right there! Who are youguys, do you work here or something? That's not important. You're not listening to me. Why aren't you turning that camera off? Because, I'm justgoing to take some footage and I'll be outof here, no problem goingon at all- Footage of what? What do you want to see here? Who are all these people? That's not important- Turn the camera OFF!! Dude, chill out. Look, I'm getting outof here, okay? I'm backing up. You need to turn the fucking camera off now. Let me justgetour tripod ok? Get out of here. Give me the camera. No. Give me the camera. Dude backoff! I'm going to call the cops are you serious? Just stop right there, alright? Stop right there. I didn't realize! We gotta go, let's justgetout of here. We're in the wrong place! We're leaving. Put the gun down and tell us where it is! I'll shoot you! You ain't got the balls to shoot me, motherfucker. I swear to god.... Get the fuck out. He's trying the door. He's trying the door! You have GOT to be kidding me. Oh my god dude! Nathan! Man, there was like three guys that came up to me outside. What did they say? They just wanted to know what the camera was about. Then they called me a pussy and shit! Now I'm glad I brought my gun. We were in trouble there for a second- You didn't tell me you had that gun. Man, are you kidding me? They are right on my fucking ass dude! He is on my ass! There's like five of them back there. They're in there. Uh, the time machine? Time machine? What are you guys talking about? Dude, he said where is the time machine? What are we gonna do those guys are like, right there? I can't outrun them, I'm in an SUV I can't do anything. I'm pulling over. You've got a gun. Are you kidding me? I'm pulling over. Make sure you're rolling tape. Get out! Roll the window down. Get out of the car. Roll the window down!! Get a license plate! Get his license plate! Whoah! Did you get it? Somebody get it!! It's too dusty man, it's too dusty! Can you see it? Can you tell anything at all? Hang on a second. I can't even make out a letter. What is the problem? I can't see it. Wait til they go around the curve. ...you've got to get it before then... Whoah! Shit! (sonic boom) What the FUCK just happened here? Dude. Look it's the.... I'm gonna be sick. No no no... Get that? Did one of you get that? Yeah, I got it! You got it? We need to fucking look at it. What the fuck just happened? No, that didn't just happen. ...I mean here's the truth- It flew! A car flew! That doesn't mean that this isn't something that is just military, or government. I mean this is technology that we don't understand, that doesn't mean anything about the future, the moon, or time travel. I don't know man. It's all too coincidental. That tunnel could have been some secret military installation. Like Area 51- but that unguarded? You don't just slip into Area 51- You don't get within a miles radius of that stuff- But it wasn't unguarded, they came after us! It was guarded! I think they would have kept it, I mean our government doesn't like accidents right? I mean, or they are the idiots that everyone says they are- where two guys can just find their prize possession- and just walk out with it? and we're still alive. Well that's what I'm saying! If it's something that's so easy to go in and take why so pissed about it? And who are they? And why the threats? Why the scare tactics? Why not just come right out and say it? 'Hi, I represent a secret government group, and you found something really important and we need it back. Can we please have it back. A time machine. They didn't have to tell us it was a time machine! Why would they tell us that? Who told you that? The guy inside? Dude, the machine! The machine is back at the office! Okay we've got to get the machine. They drug us out here to get us away from the fucking machine! They could already be there! Wait a minute... Of course, we've still got the stone!! Oh, brilliant! But wait that's not good because that means we haven't seen the last of them yet. By this time, their homes had already been ransacked, but the time machine remained secure, and remained hidden. It was however the STONE that was of the utmost importance. The book that they found in the box, detailed experiments with the stone and the time machine together, which were only successful in a little to no atmosphere environment. Perhaps this was the explanation for the failure of the machine, and once again a connection to earth's only celestial counterpart... the moon. Some guy left this for you. Thanks... Did you see this? What is that? I don't like this. So what do we do? What are we doing? I don't know. I think we're getting the fuck out of here is what we're doing. (crows cawing) Do you have cell phone signal? Let me see... no. I don't like this dude. I don't feel good about this. I need some sign of life in the next 15 seconds or I'm out of here. Hello!! Dude... And I'm glad you're taping this because people need to know the truth. Whenever you're ready, tell us your name. My name is David James. D-A-V-I-D. J-A-M-E-S. Excellent, Dave go ahead and tell us what you've been telling us here for the last couple of minutes. Where do you want me to start? I'd actuallylike to talk about this backpack. Oh yeah. You turned it on didn't you? Yeah. How did you know that? I've got a room full of equipment back there, I've got my ears on. So do they. It's how I found you... it's how they found you. Tell us who you are. I am a moon escapee. ...expound on that please. Well, I escaped from the moon when I was very young. I worked in section 14-D, I was training for a mission project, and there were about six or seven hundred other people that I fled with. This was years ago. Why did they flee? To escape government oppression. There's governmenton the moon? Oh yeah. Okay... let's back up. There's a lotof ground to cover. There is. Okay, tell me about this time travel theory. Oh, it's not a theory. Time travel is real. You have met in your lifetime, probably10 people that were from the future. They're called Transient Dimensionaries, And I imagine you'd be shocked to know who some of them are. Plato, Aristotle, Elvis, Alexander the Great, Benjamin Franklin. So they were all Lunologists? Well, they were all from the future. You can't confuse Transient Dimensionaries with the Church of Lunology, There is a difference. Transients are people who are from the future. If you're from the moon, you're from the future. Or from moon ancestry. The people who belong to the Church of Lunology Are just regular folks, they just subscribe to that belief. It was started by a fellow named J. Ari Hilliard, He's the one who unlocked time travel, and set up the moon program. December 21, 2012. 8 days from now. It's absolutely the most important date in human history. Why? Well it's launch date. Your people down here know it as the end of the Mayan calendar. By the way the Mayans weren't what everyone thinks, but it's zero hour. And in 8 days they'll pack up everything, and ship out. Who will? The team of scientists that make up the lunar program. That is the crew of Atlantis Endeavor. They'll pack up everything, and travel back in time to the year 350 B.C. And they will recultivate the earth, and reestablish society as a whole. How about that? The claims made by this man left me with many philosophical and theological questions. For the answers I decided I must turn to experts of my own. You always hear about the lost city of Atlantis, but you never hear about her sister city, The lost city of Lunopolis. Lunopolis is the legendary city on the moon. Some people think it was an advanced race that lived there, But they were actually the human race, from a distant future. If one chooses to subscribe to the religion of Lunology, one must believe in 6 things; One, that there is a city on the moon. Two, that time travel truly does exist. Three, that man did achieve immortality. Four, that there is indeed a long lost stone of power, Five, that there is a dimension beneath that of our own, that is a previous timeline of this earth, and six, that the new Hilliard is alive today, and probably already located on the moon. First we have the theory of time travel. Scientists have long grappled with this concept, and it is widely believed that, yes, it is very possible, But that going backwards is the only option, because going forward would mean a transdimensional leap, Which, we cannot do. But with time travels, I tend to look at it this way, either we're stationary, and time is moving, or time is stationary, and we're moving. either way, we're in shift and in flux in a pretty dramatic way That we're not really aware of. Do we have that today, I think we do. I think that we have had individuals who have come from our future... Instances like George Washington, or individuals who have come from... risen up if you will, out of nothingess, to some measure of tremendous greatness. Were these people part of that sacred order, that holy order, that do travel through time. Who come back into what is their history, to plant things contemporarily for us, that change our world. Does the Atlantis Endeavor, have anything at all to do with the lost city of Atlantis? It is the lost city of Atlantis. You see originally, they set up the island as a base, sortof a counterpart for Lunopolis. The crews would transfer materials, and set up... It was a site for transport and the experiments that they did. But as people began to sail and navigate the seas, It was just too vulnerable to be... well, people found out about it. And by the time they decided to cut bait, and sink the island to the bottom of the sea, it was too late. Enough people had seen it and knew about it... that's how the whole story of the lost island got started. What kind of missions are they carrying out? Well, think about it. If people have gone and screwed up the entire world, and you had the opportunity to go back and change things, you'd want to change it so they didn't screw everything up right? And science has long known that coersion is the best way to get people to change. Not by dictating to them through the whims of a dictator, it's simply a matter of putting key people in key positions so the changes can be made without anyone realizing. When appropriate changes need to be made, to the mistakes that have happened when people screw things up, they go back and unscrew them. I mean, John Wilkes Boothe, Lee Harvey Oswald, Mark David Chapman. Isn't that the guy that killed John Lennon? Oh yeah. You have no idea what he was about to do. That sounds kind of evil. It wasn't supposed to be anything butgood when it started. Copernicus got people to understand the world was round, Newton, people could understand or atleastget their brains around the idea of gravity, Susan B. Anthony, women's movement. Franklin, with electricity. These were huge advancements in society, and put people years ahead in terms of progress. And these people were transient, they moved from the moon, receiving their orders there, they came back with the directives, made the changes that were necessary, and went back to report. Wow, so are they still doing this today? Hell yeah! Fellows, it's why people reportlittle lights in the sky, UFO's... Guys, it's just traffic going back and forth, and it's been goingon that way... forever. Okay well if they've done all this once, they've made the change, then why do they have to do it again? Whygo through this, all over again? Well they have to, they have to repeat it. It's a return to paradox date. Or else everything that they did, will be undone. You see the changes that were necessary in the first place, have to be remade each time. This is pretty ridiculous. What, you never had Deja Vu? You never had something happen to you that you were sure happened before, felt like it happened before? ...yeah. Fellows, there's a reason you get that idea. We're still occupying the same earth, the same space... it's just that the layer underneath doesn't recognize the layer above. (laughs) you get an idea that something has already happened... it's already happened. To go back into the past, you're simply rewinding what has already happened. When the past changes, the future is erased, and from that momenton, there is no future left to go back to. Every time the cycle is made, a new dimension is created, but we no longer see or experience the previous dimension. Supposedly, we're still on the second timeline, the second dimension, The lunar school of thought is that if they go back again, it will become the third dimension. But there is another theory. It states that with each and every change made in the first timeline, we skew in a brand new timeline, ultimately resulting in not justone, but hundreds of new timelines, that branch out in all directions uncontrolled, all solely based on the changes made in the first dimension. What this means is there might not be three dimensions, but millions upon millions. These were some of the difficult principles they were grappling with from the very beginning. The group that went back the first time, to fix our broken past, had nothing to go on but earth's recorded history. sadly, it was largely inaccurate and misleading, resulting in mistakes made by the Atlantis Endeavor mission itself. Now, this led to a brand new string of errors, resulting in the world we have today. But instead of learning the lessons, and giving up, they want to go back. Now that they have accurate information, they think they can avoid the mistakes they made on this timeline. But what they are not taking into consideration, are the ramifications associated with doing this too many times. Believers were beginning to doubt the doctrine, because they felt they must be making too many changes. They felt there would be too many dimensions created by continuing to repeat the cycle. When you change one thing you know about, you change millions of other things you don't. You create something you never intended to do. So, for each trip back, we were layering, essentially stacking dimensions. And in a finite physical universe, what this does is, it thins each dimension, it weakens and leaves the more vulnerable to crossovers. Crossovers occur due to thinning dimensions, which you learn about at level 4 Awake. Ghosts, angles, Deja Vu, reincarnation, it's all the same thing. It's merely living life at the same time, in different dimensions. If you've ever head something moving around in your house when it's quiet? It's most likely you somewhere else, transdimensionally! When minor historical alterations are made, the variations are only slight. It's notlike you're a man in one dimension, and a woman in the other. So, if on the first timeline you went to the bathroom at 4:15, maybe, on an adjacent timeline, something happened, to make you go to the bathroom, at 4:20. Just enough time to cross paths with yourself, on another plane. There's an element of morality to it because you ask the question could I go back and start it over and do it right again? And if so, what would be the implications of what would go wrong? Pure chaos theory would argue that either way, it would not be what you expect, and there would be something inconsistent that would happen, and throw all original assumptions out the window. All of these possibilities that I've been explaining to you, none of it would be possible, without the Luna Stone. It's a large, green circular gem, unlike anything man has ever seen before. And when they found it, they were astounded, but who put it there, that's the question. Was it God? was it aliens, was it someone testing us to see what we would do with such awesome power? The scientists understood, they recognized... J. Hilliard recognized that the stone had a tremendous power. But they discounted all sense of deity. Satan, God... they took the power to themselves, it was a power they were to wield, and by their justification through whatever process of rationalization, their explanation, their understanding became, Lunology. It became their religion, their faith. And their faith is in themselves. But not without that stone. I quickly discovered that the Church of Lunology was brainwash central for the weak minded. they sought out those who were easily influenced. If you're the kind of person to show up at a rally, you're a very likely candidate for the organization, because you're willing to be. and transdimensional changes were supposed to be happening all the time but, only the higher ups were aware of them. And they'd let us in on it... for a price. Now with the church itself, this is where the money comes in. This knowledge doesn't come cheap. You don't work your way through the ranks of Lunology without paying for courses, and seminars, and tapes and lectures and so forth. From day one, they begin new members on a regiment, in a program they call 'Awakening'. Okay, awakenings are basically step by step levels of progression, through the program. So alevel one awake would be being aware that you are existing on a plane of space and time. A level two awake is that we're all operating simultaneously on a plane of space and time, A level three that nature and the earth is the same. Eventually you reach the top, a level 8. Where you supposedly realize that you are not only on this level of space and time, but every single dimension that layers beneath it. As alevel 8 awake, I was told that I would experience total recall on every plane. which means I would become aware not only of our present timeline, but previous alternate timelines that no one else could remember. The whole church believed this, and they all seemed to think it was perfectly normal. It's all about touching other dimensions. and if something on our timeline was changed due to lunar influence, they would know about it immediately because they were 'awake'. Unfortunately I wasn't experiencing that feeling. It suddenly seemed so phony to me, I mean basically this gave them the power to claim anything they wanted to, right on the spur of the moment. Somebody would go, 'Oh wait, something just changed... Now Barack Obama is President. It used to be Al Gore.' and they would all agree 'Oh yeah, you're right. It changed.' ...it was absolutely ridiculous. Many of them became convinced that there were things going on that they were not being told about. they figured that you make one change to the past that it's like opening some Pandora's box that would break the fabric of time and space and make daily changes happen all the time. So they all got these Polaroid cameras and they'd go around taking reference pictures, that's what they called them, 'reference pictures' of the daily changes, just in case. And I would say, 'well what's changing?' And they would say 'everything.' Polaroid cameras were used because supposedly, even when historical changes would take place the hardcopy evidence still remained. It somehow escaped the change, and served as evidence of the change. They said that digital cameras were no good because the digital data would change, so they needed the hard copies. Polaroids allowed one to immediately tag something for future reference. They'd run around taking pictures, but they would never let anyone see the pictures to confirm that what they were saying was true. that ultimately is the fundamental principle of the Church of Lunology, that you can achieve the ability to interact with every dimension. This is where the Luna Stone comes into play. The Luna Stone is a mythical alien rock that was supposedly found on the moon during Apollo 11. This stone is credited as the power that actually unlocked time travel. It's transdimensional powers, and the very idea of multiple dimensions, created such organizations as the Luna Society, the Atlantis Program, and many others. So all of this was building up to one thing. The big great master plan that nobody is supposed to know unless they were a higher up in the church, or actually had been there in the beginning. The moon, the time travel, it was all on the agenda, but what he really needed was to buy himself some more time. Time to further develop the really advanced science he had been working on. The legend says that the whole moon program was just step one of a much larger project... Immortality. Hilliard's true passion. He believed that he had cracked the code of the human genome, and could perfect everlasting life. It was to be the greatest discovery in the world, the greatest, scientific discovery, but, like many things, it proved to good to be true. He performed the experiments on himself in secret, and as the legend goes, he succeeded, and became immortal. There are a number of stories that floated around through the years and eventually became considered myth or legend. The lunar mythology surrounding the story of J. Hilliard is quite fascinating in it's detail. These are latter texts which appear almost as amendments to the original. It talks of Hilliard's descent into madness upon discovery of immortality. Which he quickly realized was a power that no man should have. however by this time the organization was well under way, and considered extremely successful. The other leaders decided that Hilliards unusual experiments and subsequent mental illness, were going to be damaging to the program. And in his madness, he believed the moon mission to be flawed, and so he set out to destroy it. But by that time, the people that were working with him had become too powerful. They were the program now, and they really didn't need him any longer. so he fled for his life, came to earth and tried to tell everyone here. But no one believed him. No one listened. And so he finally realized that what he wanted was just to die but because of his succes in the immortalization process, he couldn't. So what would the answer be? What can he do... but wait. wait an eternity of lifetimes. For what? For himself. For that moment that he might wrap his hands around an infant body of himself. Not yet affected by the stone... and strangle the life from it. And free himself... from his own, earthly life. Damn. That's a long time to wait. It's a very long time. So, he did the only thing he could do. He went back to the moon and tried to execute himself when he was born. That attempt failed, that was back in 1947. By that time they didn't even believe that he still existed. They thought he was long dead. It had been so many years. But still, they waited for him. The project was too big, he couldn't destroy it, he could only expose it. And on his second attempt, in his final desperation to expose the whole project, he hijacked a ship from the moon, and plowed it into the desert out in New Mexico... never heard from again. Roswell New Mexico? Roswell. Why didn't it work? Why wasn't the whole program exposed then, in Roswell? The U.S. Government covered it up! They were scared, really scared. Becuase what they found in that wreckage wasn't aliens... It was human people. Earth type people. I think looking back they would have rather found aliens. Supposedly, though he failed at killing his infant self, he did manage to steal something else... the Luna Stone. So, Hilliard stole it and brought it to earth? Along with his prototype first time machine. It all vanished along with his ship, his body. People say the U.S. Government kept it hidden, others believe he just vanished. they say they keep it in a secret place, along with everything else they can't explain or understand. That's why the church has worked so hard to infiltrate the government. You see they can't go anywhere, and do anything, until they have that stone. It's how this whole thing started, it's how the whole church started. Lunology. some search for a stupid hidden rock. Couldn't they justgo get it where theyoriginally found it? I mean if we're on a new timeline, in a new dimension, there should be a new stone, right where the firstone was, right? That's what they thought. But when they got there, it wasn't there. So, if it even still exists, where do you think the stone is today? Oh, if I had to guess... I'd say it's right there in your backpack. My god. To think of all the changes, all the power, this little gem made possible. And all the years searching for it, and you two guys just walk into a room and pick it up. That's unbelievable. That is truly amazing. So you don't know what this is then? No, I've never seen that before in my life. You didn't make any calls to a radio show, contact a radio program... No, I don't know what you're talking about there. Is that the picture you were telling me about. The Polaroid? Yeah. What about that guy? You ever seen that guy before? Oh I don't know fellows. There is a familiarity about his face I suppose. Yeah, well it's because of this picture that everything happened. It's because of this picture we found the stone. That's what led you to the tunnel? Yeah. Well I don't know, I don't know anything about it. Well, why would they use a Polaroid? Polaroid is instantaneous. Things change, but what the picture was showing the image of at that time, doesn't change. How is that possible? Like alot of things are possible I guess guys. I mean there's a certain amount you just have to chalk up to, ...blind luck. (heavy knocking) Hold this. wait right here. Just stay. (loud banging) You fellas are gonna have to go. Just go okay. Stay under the radar, I'll be in touch. Just go that way. Where are we supposed to go? Afraid to return home, they decided it was best to remain on the road, until hearing from David James. Driving day and night, in fear for their very lives, They tried to convince themselves that this could not possibly be happening. But with each passing day, the danger only grew. Trying to find a reason not to believe, they searched everywhere for answers. But in the end they found very little. The original Holy Lunar Testament was published in 1940, It became the foundational document for the Church of Lunology. J. Hilliard's recorded birth was not until years later, in 1947. This means, if true, it was the immortal Hilliard who penned the verses, This would ultimately, prove everything. The man with the radio show, George Larson, had been off the air for 13 days, and was still missing. And as it turns out, he was not the only one. Coming up tonight on TV8, new evidence in the bizarre disappearance of University Professor Dr. Orin Raymond two days ago. We'll have that, and your holiday weekend forecast, only on TV 8. (smashing sounds) I say we go back down the tube. What!? I'm serious, we go, turn the fucker on, drop it down the hole, and run like hell. We can't do that. We have to capture it on tape if we're going to do it. I mean we've been rolling tape on everything else... Yeah but what difference does it make if the world is about to end? The world is not about to end. Seems like it. And even if it does, even if it did, didn't he say that photos and video and everything would stay? That it wouldn't change? Well if that were the case, if that happened, we could have the most valuable footage on the face of the earth, if we have it. Well that's a good point. But that's not what it's all about right now you know... Well what else is it about? Why are we doing this? What are we doing if that's not what it's all about? Jesus, I mean Jesus... I can't believe we're talking about this like its... real? Yeah. Well what else is it? It feels pretty fucking real to me! We're in this whether we like it or not. We're involved. So we have to shoot it. Shooting it is our only defense! That's all we have. We have to shoot it. Alright so we have to shoot it. But I mean why can't we just throw it down the hole, and shoot it from a distance, shoot it from where they can't fucking see us. It's wide open, there's plenty of sky, we can see them coming from anywhere... Alright. Well that's what we'll do. We turn it on, we drop it down the hole, we run like hell. And we capture it, best we can. Yeah. Hey man! Hey Art. What's up? You're not going to believe this... We gotta to go back! we need you to take us back out there. Can I help you? Yeah we have to go back out to the house, but we're not going down, we're just going to bring something back. What are you guys talking about? The tunnel... from last week. Well you showed up a little late today, we're actually closed. Wait is something the matter? You gotta go somewhere? Uh I think it's pretty simple, I said we're closed. You're closed? Why does that matter? You were closed last time? Remember the hole? The houseboat, we went down last week? Uh what was that? I don't know you, I don't know you, and I don't know you... And I don't want anything to do with what you guys are doing. Art! I don't want anything to do... Fucking Art? What are you calling me by my name for? I don't know your name, I don't know you... Why are you following me, why have you got this camera in my face? Somebody talked to him man. Who talked to you? You know what, just give them what they want Sonny! Hey! Hey get back here! Fuck you! Fucking take it!! You rolling? Come on. Come on. God dammit! Sorry man! Sorry! This ain't right! Go man. Just go. Just go. We just stole a boat. What else the fuck were we supposed to do? Alright, well? This is the spot man. This isn't the spot. This doesn't look anything like the other spot. No, the water can't have risen that much. There is no fucking houseboat, but this is the spot. This doesn't look anything like the spot. Just, are they the same numbers as last time? It's the same numbers. They're the same numbers. It's the same numbers. Hello? Well!? ...so now what? Yep, he's long gone. New game plan. Let's just get out of here. Hey man. Hey. Go wake everybody up. Hey, go wake everybody up. This is it, this is Dave. We're going to have to get on the road if we're going to make it in time. Dave! Dave we thought you were dead! Almost guys, almost. What happened? Listen I don't have alot of time. Listen to me. You gotta give them the stone. Dave, look I'm going out of my mind here. We don't know what to do about all of this. I am more scared than I've ever been in my life, and I don't even know what I'm afraid of! You have every right to be afraid. But these guys are serious people, they're running out of time... If you don't give it back, we're fucked. In two days, if they don't have that stone back... We tried to give it back! We went back to the tunnel, There's nothing there. It's gone, everything is gone! Of course it's gone! They're not going to leave that exposed! Look if you guys want to live through this, Give that stone to Hilliard himself. Yeah right. I'm serious! And how are we supposed to do that? We don't even know if the guy exists. Oh he exists. Trust me, he exists. So what do we do? We look him up in the phone book? You go to the church! They'll handle it! They'll take care of it! And what if we don't? Don't what? What if we don't give it back? What if we keep it and wait until Saturday the 22 and find out exactly what happens? I mean if everything is going to go back to normal, isn't that what's best for the world? Nobody knows what's best for the world!! Nobody! Don't you understand? You guys don't know what the other timeline was like. The chaos, it was terror in the streets. Nobody wants to go back there! Dave, they will kill us! They are not going to take us seriously. Make them take you seriously! Show them the stone, take it out and show them, but tell them unless you see Hilliard himself, they'll never see it again. You have what they want. As far as I can see that is your one option. If you want to keep on going. We're going to be recycling history forever anyway. And what happens after? After what? After we give back the stone, on Saturday the 22nd, after paradox date, what happens? Nobody knows. Nobody knows what happens on Saturday the 22nd. Why not? No one's ever been there yet. Okay, so where do we even find this church? It's right there. It's right there fellows, but listen to me. make sure you see them before they see you. And good luck. What? Good luck? Aw jesus. Dude. (Matt0 I know. I mean I'm just looking for some answers here. I want to know that I'm not walking into an ambush. I don't know what, but something is going down, something big. The church is shutting down branches all over the world. They're laying people off by the thousands, closing their doors, and disappearing off the map entirely! It's already started. (Matt0 But how is that possible? How does a billion dollar organization disappear off the map? I don't know, but that central headquarters in Redwater is the only one still even operating. And only the upper clerical floors, the money counters, office personnel, women mostly. But Daniel Muscadine? He's a glorified bean counter. He'll still be there you can bet on it. He might be the CEO, but he has no power. Somebody else is pulling the strings. So I can't say that talking to him will get you anywhere, but if it's face time with Daniel Muscadine you're looking for, then now is the time to do it. ...and if I were you, I'd hurry. Hello? We're looking for Daniel Muscadine. Where is Daniel? Can I help you? We're fine. Right here. Hi guys. Which one of you is Daniel Muscadine? What the hell is this about? Look, just sit down, and shutup, if you don't mind. Look, fuck you even if you do mind. I don't want to shoot anybody today, but latelyI've been doing alot of shit I don't want to do! Look just sit okay? Please, sit. Thank you. Just please, sit. So what is this all about? What is this all about? How about your people following us around for the last 2 weeks? How about that? You know who we are, you know what we're doing here. We know all about your organization. We've done our research. Alright, the scare tactics? You don't scare us. They flying car? We saw it. Are y'all smoking somethng? Man, you're not fooling anybody. Your people have been harassing us since we found it. Since you found what? The rock. The rock? The moon rock. What did you just say? Your people, have been threatening our lives, and the lives of our famiies, we've got them on camera! Listen guys, you have me mistaken for someone else, I don't understand what's going on- STOP IT! Mr. Muscadine, would you like me to call the police? Diane don't worry about it. No. No he doesn't want to call the police right now. He's got somebody else to call. You guys are making a very terrible mistake. Yeah, we've heard. I have an idea, why don't you tell me who that is? Where did you get this? I don't know who this is... Why don't we ask this guy? Know who that is? Listen, you just spit out what you want, and get it over with, fellas. Alright? I'll tell you what we want. You tell them that we have it! Tell them if they ever want to see it again, they're going to do exactly what we say. Tomorrow, Friday. You know, your trip? Nobody is going anywhere unless we put it in Hilliard's hands. Hilliard! Or no deal! Well listen fellows, I don't know who you are... I don't really care... Yeah right look, you keep playing stupid. Meanwhile, tomorrow, Hilliard shows up when we set off the machine, or unpack all your shit, cause you won't be going anywhere. Alright? Have a nice day. You can keep that! Here I am. David? What are you doing here? David? You recognize my face? What the hell are you doing here? Shhhhit! You're still alive. You're supposed to be dead! I pray for it every night. I knew you were alive- Of course I'm still alive! You have no idea how long I have planned this! You didn't even see it coming! I would have. I may be immortal but I'm not stupid. Wait a minute! You're J. Hilliard? Well technically we both are. But not for much longer. So YOU did this? The picture, the tunnel, the thugs?! We're running for our lives, and you set this whole thing up? I'm sorry, I like you guys I really do. I wish things could have been different. The church didn't even know we had this until we TOLD them did they? I said I was sorry look I've been working at this for a while. Fucking flying car? You didn't do this for the stone? No I don't want the stone! I've had the stone. I only want my death back. We trusted you! Look I'm not a bad person. This is my last shot, it's my one chance to be done with this place! Why us? How did we fit into this? You guys just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. Forgive the pun. But you did what you were supposed to do, Don't worry about it. In a few minutes you won't remember a thing. But the world will know, now the world can know... Look you can't kill me. I know you. I know I will never be the man you were destined to be, Christ I've lived in your shadow my entire life, but I know you. Jeez after all these years you're still such a fool! There's more information this time, we have new information you don't know about- About the crystal? We know where it came from, who it came from... It was just a test. There are others. They've been watching. Watching you like they're watching us. It was just an experiment. There's something familiar about all of this. If you kill me now, everything you've worked for will be gone. But it's not about you, it's not about me, it never was. This has all happened before. This has all happened just like this... David, it was just a test, we didn't get it right! I was sitting here, I had the gun. You said- if you kill me now, everything we worked for is gone. It's all for ruin. Think about that! And I said, I have done nothing but! Oh my god... I see now, why I have to do this. Wait a minute We already failed this test. It was just a test, we didn't get it right! We failed the test. (distant) He's got a gun! We just haven't gotten it right yet! We haven't gotten it right! Until we get it right, We have to do it all...over...again. Dave! Wait! No! Dave! When I first discovered this footage, in 1992... I myself was very skeptical. I am an archeologist. I have worked in the field for 15 years. Butl have never made a discovery quite like this. Buried, hundreds of feet in the rock, at an expedition site in the Naga Hills, was an archive of materials. Books, photographs, video tapes, audio tapes... and it was determined, that all of these materials were thousands of years old. It was quite impossible to believe. I cannot truly say if this material was created in an alternate timeline, or a future that is now our past, or if we can expect similar experiences in our own timeline. If you were to ask me in what I do believe that I cannot prove, it would be that there are forces out there, the likes of which we will never understand, and probably never should. Was this the most remarkable day in the history of man? Perhaps. Where do we go from here? I do not know. Butl do believe this; that from yesterday, we can forever learn. But what tomorrow holds will forever remain a mystery. Despite the rapid loss of water, miraculously no one was hurt. U.S. Officials report the bizarre and sudden drainage of Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin is attributed to the collapse of a salt dome. Engineers are still investigating the cause of the collapse, with no clear answers yet. In tech news tonight, Ron Weatherbee has further developments in the story of an unusual piece of video that surfaced on the internet last week. The images seen in the video footage that swept worldwide across the internet in a single day, are still leaving experts scratching their heads over what appears to be, a supernatural event captured on tape. While many believe it depicts the end of the world, or extinction level cataclysmic event, others believe it may be connected with secret factions of world government, as yet undisclosed. the video was removed from the internet as quickly as it appeared, but not before being seen and downloaded by millions of viewers over the span of merely 24 hours. Detemining it's authenticity has ignited much debate, and raised hundreds of questions. As for the answers, we will probably never truly know. Ron Weatherbee, BTVNews, London.
