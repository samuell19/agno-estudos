* [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] * * [snake charmer music] [water flowing in fountain] * [dramatic music] [crackling sounds of fire] [cat meowing] * [dramatic music] [crackling sounds of fire] [sound of knife in flesh] [Tom Bennett] Yeah. Well I'm sure they would. Yeah, two points above prime is better than I can do, Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you this. Does this broker possess the same charming smile that I do? -[intercom voice] Of course not. -[laughing] Thank you very much. Can I get you two tickets to Sunday's game? -[intercom voice] No. -I didn't think so. One more question. -Does this establishment require a bond? -[intercom voice] A bond? Yeah. -[intercom voice] Yeah. -Okay. Now have you figured out if amount of money you are going to lose on interest on that bond is equal to the amount you stand to gain on points? -[intercom voice] Uh, not yet. -No? Well, I have. Yeah. You stick with Tom Bennett and you're gonna gain twenty-two thousand dollars. -[intercom voice] Okay. I'll be there. -Okay. Thank you. -Two tickets to Sunday's game and I got this deal. -Then it's a closed deal. Now listen, get back on the phone and call Alex. Look, I just got a tip from Lisa, you know, the chick I have been banging from Genex Properties? She says she has got an apartment that is screaming with character the shit that Alex has been busting your chops about. But it's gonna move fast we have a little time. -Two minutes and I'll see you in the lobby. -[Tom] Right. * [light piano music] [Mario] That's your unit. Absolute beauty. Come on. [water flowing] They haven't even had a chance to fix the place up. [door opening] [keys jingling] [Mario] Well, guys... Is this paradise? -[curtains sliding across rod] -Or is this paradise? -Now I know it's a little dirty. -[paper crumpling] But it's definitely got that character thing you two are always talking about, right? It's got a lot of space. Beautiful kitchen. I think it's fantastic. Oh-Oh. Don't say anything until we see the whole place. [Mario] Wait until you see the upstairs. [Mario] There is a huge hallway. Lots of extra room. A great bathroom. See you guys in a second. [door opening] * [haunting music] So what do you think? Don't worry about that. A coat of paint will take care of it. -But what happened here? -Ah, Lisa said the former owner decided to call it quits. Seems he went a little ga-ga and decided to cut the family jewels off. He killed himself? Well, yeah. It's the bad news but the good news is the place is great and if I wasn't doing it with the listing agent, we wouldn't be standing here. The other good news is that it will go cheap. The bank wants to get rid of it quick. So we gotta move on it. Okay? Now, listen, I'm late for a date so, you two lock up on the way out, and Tom, you're gonna thank me later. [footsteps] * [haunting music] [door creaks and slams shut] -[water fountain] -[Betty] I wish I could stay longer and get things organized. I don't know why you let his sister store his things in that bedroom upstairs. The stuff stinks and this countertop, ughh! All the crud gets caught in the middle of the tile. I think, -I just think it's very, very, unsanitary. -[Alex] Yes, mother. [Betty]Then, if you drop a glass, well, it's always gonna break on tile. Not necessarily on formica. Here you go, love, I'm sorry it took so long. -Thank you. -[Betty sighs] You'll see what I'm saying. Hello? Anybody home? Em, I'm sorry. I'll think about it. [Betty] Okay, let's get started then. Well you know... [indistinct] [cat meows] [newspaper crunch] [cat meows] [chuckle] Hey! -What's your name? -[cat purrs] We got our first visitor. Hello! -Oh! -[Tom] You used to live here, huh? Was this your home? Think we should keep it? [Betty] Oh, no. Oh, no. I don't think you should do that. You have to feed them every day and then clean that litter box. Well, we were talkin' about starting a family. It wasn't exactly what I was thinking about, but... he sure is cute. He is a she. [cat meows] [door bell rings] -Oh! Our second guest. -[door bell rings] -Hello? -[Sam] Hello, hello. I'm your neighbor. The plate on my door reads Doctor Samuel Godard, but please call me Sam. Tom Bennett, Sam. Come on in. [Sam] I hope I'm not being a nuisance coming here unannounced. [Tom] Guys, we have a visitor, our neighbor Sam. This is my wife Alex. -Alex. -[Alex] Pleasure. Oh, thank you. [Tom] And her mother, Betty. Hello... -Madame... -[Betty giggles] Why don't you have a seat, Sam? I'll get you a cup of coffee. You know, I've got an appointment but, what the hell? -I'll only stay a minute. -[Betty giggles] [Alex] Please, have a seat. [scoffs] Surely Tom must be joking. You're much too young to have a daughter Alex's age. Uh huh. [giggles] So, which apartment do you live in? Upstairs. But I've always fancied this one. You two guys are doing a wonderful job with it. Well, that's Alex. She's the creative one. -[Sam] So, you are the artist. No. Not really. I'm an art director for a design magazine. Well, then you're an artist. I can't tell you how happy we all are that you moved in. The last owner cast something of a dark shadow on the building. -Nothing, of course, that fresh faces can't erase. -[cat meows] [giggles] Are you taking in this little devil? I'm not a usual cat fancier, but this one I love. What will you call it? Uh-- Uh we don't know yet. Like animals, it will impose its personality. The name will come easy. [giggling] * [haunting music] [large cat purrs] [cat meows] [combination of purring and groans and heavy breathing] [haunting sound and music play backwards] [indistinguishable woman speaking backwards] -* [haunting music swells] -[cat purrs] [siren in distance] [water fountain] [door opens] [Bob talking indistinct to himself] [struggling with the door] Hi. I'm Alex Bennett. We're neighbors. [footsteps] Hey. Hey. -[kiss sound] -You're home early? [birds chirp] -So, I bought the kitty a little present. -A litter box? [chuckles] Yeah. So, have you met that guy that lives across the hall? [Tom] No. -We just crossed paths in the lobby. -Hum hm? So I stopped to introduce myself. He just walks right by me. It was kind of like he was afraid or something. Nah, maybe he's just shy. -Or maybe he's just a loner or something. -[cat meows] Maybe he was late to work. -[Tom] Maybe he didn't see you. -[cat meows] He saw me. [cat groans and meows] -Agh! -[chuckles] -[sound of slap] -It's not funny. It's disgusting! Hey. Come here. Why did you do that, huh? [cat purrs] [Tom] Why did you do that? -* [haunting music] -[door opens and creaks] * [tense music] [sound of knife put on table] St. Gilles is ravaged by the succubus. [sighs] This guy was into some weird stuff. [Tom] Hey! -[smack on arm] -You startled me. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -[kiss sound] I can't fix that faucet. I'll call the plumber tomorrow. -Oh, good. Well, thanks for trying. -Well... She's beautiful, eh? -Yeah. -Bet you it's his girlfriend. [Tom] And this is probably his boyfriend. Busy guy. -[laughing] You're horrible-- -Look at all this junk. It's a mess. A propane fuel cell. What was he doing with this? -Maybe he used this when he cut off his [mouth sound] "keek". -Tom I rather-- [kiss sound] wonder about something else. -So would I. -[kiss sound] [whispering] Let's get out of here. [door creaking and closing] * [haunting dark music] [sound of rat running] [cat meows] [rat and cat screech] [people moaning backwards in a dream] [man groaning] [woman panting] [Tom sighs] [cat purrs] -Fuck me... -[cat purrs] Baby... fuck me... Fuck me... [cat purrs] * [tense music] [scream] [water fountain] [sneezes] Aren't you going to work? [Alex] I don't think so. I can hardly breathe. [sound of cup on plate] Why don't you go see an allergist? Why don't you get rid of the cat? I will if you're allergic to it. [Alex] Well, I'm allergic to bloody rats on my pillow. I'm telling you, that cat did it purposely, it's got some kind of agenda. Agenda? [chuckles] Come on, Alex, I told you, that's what cats do. They bring their prey to their master. That's all the cat would do. Agenda? [Tom] Don't you think you're getting paranoid about that little kitty. -Maybe if you relax, the thing won't bug you. -[sound of cup put on counter] -Relax? -Yeah. [Alex] Yeah. Well, it's hard to relax when my husband's screaming "fuck me, baby" in his sleep all night. I mean we only had sex two hours before. Wasn't it satisfying enough for you? I thought we had already talked about that. [Tom] Why don't I just go to work? -And maybe by the time I get home-- -[Alex] Yeah. -[Tom] you'll feel a little better. I'll see you later. [footsteps] -[Mario] Fuck me, baby? Fuck me. -[Tom chuckles] -[Mario] Wow. -[Tom] Wow is right. What's wild is we just made love a couple of hours before that. -[Mario] And you're dreaming of banging some broad? -[Tom] Yeah. -You're not uh... -What? No, man. No. [laughs] How's the sex life? What? You and Alex. -Is the sex good? -It's great. I do not know how you do it. Do what? Bang the same chick over and over again. I just-- You're a real poet. You know that, Mario? Yeah, I know. -But, how do you do it? -I love her. That's how I do it. It's simple. That's beautiful, man. But do you ever look around? -Check them out? -[footsteps] [Alex] Oh, I had an allergy test when I was, I don't know, ten or so... [sneezes] Excuse me. [sniffles] I'm sorry. Um, Yeah. Okay. Fine. Well, the sooner, the better. Monday at ten? All right. Thanks. Bye. [sneezes] [cat meows and purrs] [glass breaking] -You are psycho! -[cat meows] Oh, no. Don't even think about it. * [tense music] [cat purrs] [glass breaks] -You, little bitch. That's it. -[cat meows] [footsteps on wood floor] -[cat screeches] -[Alex] Aagh! [sound of tumble down stairs] [body hitting floor] [cat meows] * [somber music] [voice on loudspeaker] [indistinct conversation] Not to worry, Thomas. I just came from the head of neurology, he's an old chum of mine. He says Alex will be back on her feet in no time. She suffers from a sprained wrist, quite a concussion of course. They may want to keep her here for a week or so for observation. -And then, she will be up and jogging. -[laughter] -[beep of heart monitor] -Thanks, Sam. Thank you. Not at all. Thank yourself for not locking the front door. I heard the crash and fortunately I was able to get into the house. Oh, don't be so modest, Sam, you saved her, you brought her here. Geez. You know we had an argument this morning and the last thing I did was I slammed the door. I didn't even kiss her goodbye and all the way over here in the car I kept thinking-- If Alex was meant to go... she'd go. Thanks again, Sam. Thank you so much. I'll just leave these flowers and kiss her goodnight. [Tom whispers] I love you. [water fountain] [cat meows] -[Tom] Two or three days. Yep, yep. -[footsteps] [Tom] No, no, thank you very much, doctor. I appreciate it. Yeah. Yeah. -[doorbell rings] -Yep. Okay. All right. Thank you, doctor. Bye-bye. Hi, I'm Lillith Cameron. Steven's sister. The bank told you I was coming. Yeah. Ummm, come on in. * [seductive music] Ummm... -[door shuts] -I'm Tom Bennett. [Chuckling] I'm sorry I'm staring. You... you look very familiar, have-- -Have we met before? -I've been told I have that kind of face. Long trip? I came from Paris. Paris? Well, you must be anxious to see your brother's things. They're umm, they're upstairs. Could I have a cup of coffee first? My head's still up in the air. Sure, I'll, um, I'll make a fresh pot. And if it's not too much trouble maybe I can freshen up? -Sure, the ah, bathroom is-- -I know where it is. [footsteps] * [haunting music] [shower running] Now I feel human. Here's a fresh cup of coffee for you. Thanks. [coffee poured in sink] [cup on saucer] [cream poured into coffee] I like what you've done here. That's my wife. She's the one that has a good eye. She must. -And, where is-- -Alex. Alex. Um, she's in the hospital. She had a little accident yesterday. -How terrible. -[Tom] Yeah. Yeah. -[pot set on counter] -The thought of losing her is uh... I'm sorry. I'm sorry about your brother. Yeah, so am I. [ambulance siren] So? So? So, did you get rid of that psycho cat? [Chuckles] What? You're very funny. I'm serious, Tom. Well, I don't want to just throw it out to the dogs. I'll find a home. You would do that to someone? Yeah, how about your mother? Very funny. Just promise me when I get home that cat will be gone. I promise. [door shuts] [sound of keys] [water fountain] [dog bark] [knock on door] * [piano music] Come in. Hello, Thomas. [door shuts] Sam? Lillith and I were catching up with each other. We became dear friends during her visits to her brother. Won't you please sit down? -[Sam] Please, sit down. -[Tom] Oh, no, thanks, I-- I have a lot of work to do. [Lillith] I should get going too. -Do you mind if I continue my work, Tom? -Sure, that's fine. Great. [in French] Bon nuit. [Sam in French] Au revoir, les efants. [footsteps] -Are you all right? -[chair creaks] Yeah, I'll be fine. Do you wanna have a night cap? Sure. -[Tom] So, um, -* [seductive haunting music] tell me about yourself, Lillith. What--What--what do you do in Paris? I do a lot of this and a lot of that. [Tom chuckles] -What about yourself? -Me? I'm in high end mortgage sales. Buildings, constructions, things like that. Yeah. I didn't ask what you do. I asked about yourself. What do you like? What do you want to do? [chuckles] That's a pretty broad question. [Lillith] Only as broad as you make it. Do you love your wife? [chuckles] You're not one for small talk, are you? No. Uh, Yes, I love my wife very much. -Why do you love her? -I love her because, because she's intelligent, she's beautiful, she's funny... [chuckles] Does she give you everything you want and need? Well, I I wonder if anybody ever really gets everything they need and want from another person. Some people give more. What about yourself? I guess you'd have to ask my wife that question. How about you? Are you that type of person? Definitely. When I get through, there is no wanting. [exhales] It's ah, two thirty. I think I better call it a night. Do you think I could stay in the spare bedroom? I'll finish my business tomorrow. Sure, that'll be okay. * [seductive haunting music] [door creaks and shuts] -* [haunting music] [siren] [door shuts] [clock chimes] * [tense disjointed music] [cats fight continuously] [water fountain] [doorbell rings] [door opens] I'm not going to let this start up again. -What? -That noise. The cats. I had enough of that when Cameron was here. The damned cats kept me up all night. Yeah, well, [chuckles] I'm sorry about that. Only one of those cats are mine. You should have the cat fixed. If you can't control them, I'll call the pound and get them put down. We let it go on so long, sir. [Lillith] Just because an animal is smaller and less powerful, doesn't give you the right to have it fixed. How would you like it if we fixed you? I won't put up with it. You better find a way to stop it. [footsteps] [door shuts] [door opens] [indistinct loud talk] [Sam] Ooh, ooh, drop by drop, eh? -[laughter] -Hey, is this a hospital or a social club? [laughter] Ahh, life is whatever you make it. Tom, my sisters Anie and Matilda. [in French] Mes filles, je vous present Tom. We're simply celebrating the recovery of Alex. And now that I'm getting to know her best friend, Betty-- [Betty giggles] -I understand much better where Alex got her strength from. -Oh, Sam! [Sam] Now, ladies, maybe we should leave the young lovers together? -Sure -[Sam's sister] Merci. -Good bye. [Kiss sound] -* [Sam singing in French] Champagne, food of love. * [singing in French] [giggles] [chuckles] -[Alex] And how are you doing? -Good. -[Kiss sound] -Hmmm. -I miss you. -I miss you. -I can't wait to go home. -I can't wait for you to come home. So, what are you gonna do today? I thought maybe I'd go for a bike ride with Lillith, em, Mario. -And who is Lillith? -Lillith is um, is um... Cameron's sister. She finally showed up for the stuff, yeah. Yeah. -Well, that's good. -Yeah. -We can finally fix up that room. -Yeah, she'll get that stuff out and we can fix it up. [Kiss sound] [water fountain] [bicycle gears winding] [keys jingling] * [haunting music] [indistinct police dispatcher] What happened to him? -Looks like your neighbor had a heart attack. -[police siren] Isn't that blood? Well, it isn't ketchup. [footsteps] If he had a heart attack, why is there all that blood? What the paramedics tell me his heart damn near exploded. Internal bleeding. Poor son of a bitch. -Coroner's on his way. -[indistinct police dispatcher] [door opens] [keys jingling] [door shuts] [Lillith] Are you hungry? I cooked you one of my favorites, to thank you for putting me up. Okay, I uh, I'll just take a quick shower and I'll be right down. Nope. You eat fish when it's ready to be eaten. And this fish is ready. * [seductive music] [sound of silverware on plate] [sighs] It was amazing. Food is one of my passions. I can tell. This was amazing. [chair shuffle over floor] [moans] Yeah, that was ah, quite a meal. You said that already. [slow footsteps] [nervous laughter] * [seductive haunting music] You want me, don't you? [chuckles] Uh, Lillith, I... Stop acting like a boy. You want me. [moans] I'm not after your marriage. I'm not after your life. [sighs] I'm talking about sex, Tom. Sex is good. It's not something to be ashamed of. [moans] You just want to fuck me... and I just want to fuck you. [doorbell rings] -[moans] -I'll get that. No. [moans] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [louder moans] [doorbell rings insistently] [doorbell rings] -[door opened] -[Betty] What took you so long to answer the door? -I brought you some roasted chicken. -[door shuts] -I was just about to go out. -[Betty] Now you don't have to. Sam says the food is really good in this pla-- Oh, Betty, this is Lillith. She's the uh, former owner's sister. She just flew in from Paris to settle his estate and well, she wanted to thank me for storing her brother's things by cooking me this delicious meal, poached salmon, it was wonderful. -It's too bad you weren't here. -[Betty] Uh huh. -And ah, well, she's going home. -[doorbell rings] We're just waiting for a cab. I just called a cab. -[Sam] Hello, hello? Tom, Betty, anybody home? -[Tom] Sam! Come on in, please. [Sam] Okay. -Oh, there you are, my sweetheart. -[Betty chuckles] [Sam] Lill... Betty and I were just about to step out for coffee. Would you care to join us? Uhh. No, I-- I-- I have a lot of work to do and, why don't the three of you go along? Tsk. I couldn't leave you with the dishes. [Tom] No, don't, I love doing dishes. I do the dishes all the time. Really. Well, if you don't mind, then. [water fountain] [birds chirp] [door opens] Ever noticed how the birds in this courtyard seem to sing a more gleeful song than the birds outside? [chuckles] -Hi, Tom. -Sam. [Keys jingling] You feeling all right? Yeah, I feel fine. Why? The look in your eyes. You have that worried look about you. I'm, I guess I'm just not used to living alone. Mm hmm [chuckles] Shouldn't worry about it so much. You know, you have very little control over your own destiny. So, relax. Enjoy. [muffled clink of keys] * [jazz music in restaurant] [ambience sounds] [Mario] So, tell me when's Alex coming home? Soon, I hope. Listen, did you get that memo about the O'Leary subdivision? Those idiots are six months behind. At this point it's costing me and the bank ten thousand dollars a day. You know, I call up O'Leary, he gave me the weather insurance, but I have no time to spoon feed these people. I wanna be moving to a new place by the end of the month. -[Mario] If I can get my hands, on a brand new car-- -[haunting noises] [snaps fingers] [Mario] Tommy... I know I'm not that interesting. But the chicks in here are not that hot. Send a copy of that over to Paul and, and fax one to Frank too, okay? [phone rings] Then I need you to ah-- Hello? [into speakerphone] [Lillith over loudspeaker] I want to fuck you. Ah, we will ah, yeah. [door shuts] -Lillith? -[Lillith over the phone] I wanna fuck you now. I'm ah... [chuckles] I'm working, ah... [Lillith over the phone] I'm at your apartment, waiting. Well, I can't, I-- ah... [dial tone] Hello? * [suspensful music] [door shuts] * [suspensful music] [footsteps] [door closed] [footsteps] * [intense music] * [seductive haunting music] * [intense music] [moans] [belt buckle loosening] [sighing and moaning] [gasps at climax] [birds chirp] [water fountain] [footsteps down stairs] [Lillith] She's pretty, isn't she? I found her in the courtyard. [footsteps] What's wrong? You feeling guilty, aren't you? Guilt's another word for weakness. Did you enjoy last night? [Tom sighs] I have to go to work. -No, you don't. -Yes, I do. -Call 'em up and tell 'em you're sick. -No, no, no. No, no, I can't... Yes, you can. [keys jingling] You are not leaving me. You are mine now. -All mine. -[keys jingling] -No... -[sound of zipper] Lillith, Lillith... [kissing sounds] [moans] [cat purrs] [cat licking plate] [Tom gasping] Lillith. [sound of traffic] Well, I think as soon as you give me the stats on the Webster deal I can close it. The thing is I'm in on the commission on this one, okay? I've been doing all the ground work here, I'm not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. -[Tom] Okay, I'll take care of you. -Yeah, yeah. [sound of office working] * [seductive haunting music] [door closes] Lillith? [Mario] Piacere, Lillith. -I'm Mario. -Goodbye, Mario. [office worker talking] [door closes] -Lillith, I got a lot of work to do. -[Lillith moans] * [seductive haunting music] [moans] [chair squeaks] [groans] [moaning] [chair bumps on bookshelves] [moans] [groans] [items falling off shelf] [continued moaning] [sound of phone off the hook] [belt buckle clink] [kissing] See you tonight. [door opens] How are you doing? How do you think? Good ol' Tommy boy. -Good standing, straight shooting... -[door shuts] one woman guy... Don't say a word. -[Mario] Man, that is one nice piece of ass. -You don't know the half of it. Man... [Tom picking up objects] she's from another planet. I tell you, she's got this energy just makes me go fuckin' wild. I never felt more possessed, more strong, more like a fuckin' goddamned man. Whew, that is one hell of a sales pitch. [Tom] That's no sales pitch, man. That's the truth. Why don't you get me stats on that, that Webster deal and we'll close it, right? I'll clean this up in... [snaps his fingers] Let's get crackin', man. You got it, man. I'm on it. [books placed on shelf] Hello. How you feeling? -What's wrong? -[Alex sighs] Oh, let me see... I haven't heard from you in a day and a half. During which time my mother informs me that you're having a candlelight dinner with some beautiful woman named Lillith. And perhaps this is the same Lillith that you, inadvertently, said that you were taking a bike ride with. A Freudian slip, no doubt. This coming from the same married man who's screaming fuck me in his sleep all night. Okay, well, I'll, I'll ah... I'll answer you in, in order of your accusations. [inhales] First of all, I had a deadline to meet on the Webster Street project so I, I've been working all day and night trying to get the papers ready for that. [Tom] I know I should have called you. I'm, I'm sorry about that. Ah, secondly, ah, Yes, I did have dinner with the beautiful Lillith, as your mother stated. [sighs] She wanted to, thank me for taking so long in getting to her brother's things and maybe it was naive of me, but I thought it was a nice gesture, so I, I accepted dinner. And thirdly, yes I did have an uh, an erotic dream and a Freudian slip. Sorry about that, but what's the big deal? Would you rather I have a dream or actually sleep with someone else? Oh. God! [giggles] I guess I'm just going stir crazy. This room is like a prison cell. Friends? Friends. [water fountain] [cats meowing] [footsteps] * [dramatic music] [door closes] [door opens] [laughter] * [piano music] -[Sam speaks in French] -[door closes] At that point, enters the lord of the house. [chuckles] [speaks in French] Great. Now we can eat. [clock tick tock] -* [music changes] -[Sam] At first, I wanted to be the artist. But I soon realized that my true vocation was more in the appreciation than in the creation of art. And yet, those years in art school weren't a complete waste. They gave me confidence in my collecting. Wonderful collection you have. I'd say so. And another wonderful meal I've had. Excuse me. [plates clink] [plates set on kitchen counter] [kitchen utensils fall] [metal pans clang] [moans] [moans] [louder moans] [Lillith] Oh, yes, yes! [crashing] [Lillith] Oh, yes, yes! [wine poured in glass] [heavy breathing] [louder moans] [sigh] She's coming home tomorrow. [water fountain] * [dramatic music] [keys jingling] [door opens] [keys jingling] [footsteps] [door shuts] -What's wrong? -Nothing, nothing, just uh, are you sure you're gonna be alright alone? Come on, it's only a sprain. -I'll be fine. -Okay. -Tell you what... -What? Why don't you bring home -some chinese food, some red wine-- -Hmm? and chocolate ice cream. -Okay. -[keys jingling] Go on. Go on. [kissing] I don't want to make you late. [keys jingling] Alright. -I'll be fine. -[door opens] [door shuts] [phone rings] Hello? Hello? [Lillith over phone] Is Tommy there? No, he isn't. May I ask who's calling? [Lillith over phone] Tell him it's Lillith. He'll know what it's concerning. -Well, why don't you tell me? -[dialtone of phone] [phone beeps] Hmm! [phone on counter] * [dramatic music continues] [phone beeps] [dialing on phone] [phone rings] [Laura over phone] Tom Bennett's office. Laura? Hi, it's Alex. Em, -may I speak with Tom, please? -[Laura over phone] I'm sorry, Alex, but he's not here right now. He's not? [banging of head on bed board] [loud moans] * [tense music] [door opens] [phone rings] [phone continues to ring] Hello? [Alex over phone] Hello? Hello? [phone on receiver] Come on. No, I can't.

[door shuts] * [dramatic music continues] [glass breaks] [water fountain] * [dramatic music continues] [cats meow] [door opens] [door closes] [door opens and closes] Alex? Alex? [phone buttons beep] Betty, is Alex there? -Betty, please-- -[dial tone] * [tense music] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Paul] Hi. -Does Steven Cameron live here? -[Tom] Who are you? [Paul] I'm Paul Douglas, I'm a friend of his. I'm Tom Bennett. Come in. -[Paul] Does he live here? -[Tom] He did. [door shuts] [Paul] Did he move? [Tom] He killed himself. [Paul] Ah... [Tom] Who are you? I'm Paul Douglas, I... was a friend of Steven's, we, yeah, we worked together on an archeological dig in Scotland and, and I was to work with him here at the university. Did he leave a note or something? [Tom] He wrote some words on the wall. Three words, Savangi, Savansi, Sema... something. That explains... that explains this letter that he sent me. He, he said that he was he was being destroyed by witches... a succubus. [Paul] I was amused. Steven... had a, a rather dark sense of humor. What do those words mean? -[Paul] According to mythology those are three angels-- -[Lillith] Can I help you? This is Lillith, Steven's sister. Lillith? I... I thought Steven didn't have any family. Steven was a very private man. Who are you? Paul Douglas. I'm a friend of Steven's. Paul Douglas. He told me about you. He said you were a cheap opportunist after his job. What? He also said you owed him a lot of money. Are you here to pay him back or to borrow some more? Ms. Cameron, I, I was a very good friend of Steven's and I can assure you that there has been some mistake. I don't know what's going on. Are you calling me a liar? No. -* [intense music] -[Paul groaning] [head hitting door] [Paul pushed out in hallway] [door shuts] Do you still love me? [Tom] Why did you write that letter to Alex? I asked you if you still love me. * [tense music] -[Tom] I can't... -* [seductive haunting music] Yes, you can. [Tom] Please, Lillith... There is a limit. No, there isn't. [heavy breathing] * [somber music] [phone rings] [phone continues ringing] Hello. [Alex over phone] Meet me in the park by the playground in one hour. -Alex... -[Alex over phone] I don't wanna hear it. -Just meet me there. -[phone disconnected] Lillith? Lillith! [Lillith] Good morning, sweetheart. [Tom] Get me out of these. Lillith... [moaning] [kissing] Get me... -[handcuffs lock] -[Tom grunts] [swing creaks] [ambience sounds] You lied to me. I feel like I've been pushed down ten flights of stairs and someone is just kicking me in the stomach. How could you? It just happened. I don't care how it happened. You need to make a decision. Promise me it's over. [birds chirp] * [somber music] Come on, Tommy, what's the matter with you? We haven't even hit the hills yet. [bicycle gears] [Mario breathing hard] You know, for a guy who's having the time of his life, you sure look like shit, man. [chuckles] So, Doc, am I gonna live? You got a very high temperature and your glands are swollen. If you don't get better I'm gonna put you in the hospital. We'll take some blood test for the mono and a few other things and we'll go from there. [Doctor] Let me ah... Let me ask you a personal question though. -Yeah. -Have you been ah... wildly stressed or overworked lately? Maybe I have been exercising a little too much. Okay, take off your shirt and we'll have to listen to your chest. [Tom sighs] What kind of exercises you been doing? * [tense music] [cats meow and purr] What are all these cats doing here? There aren't any cats. They're everywhere. Relax, Tom. I spoke to the doctor. He said with your fever you may be prone to hallucinations. -He said you need to relax. -[Tom] He said I needed to rest. -[Lillith] He said relax. -[Tom groans] -[Sam] I just had no idea what was happening. -* [piano music] I tried you at the hospital, then I called Betty. I just don't understand. Tom will come to his senses. He will come crawling back to you. -Asking for your forgiveness. -No, he's closed that door. No. You will open it. You will take him back. And Tom will prove the most loving, the most caring husband and father imaginable. Tom is a fine man. If you love him, if you truly love him, and I know you do, you will open your heart. You will forgive him. One mistake does not tarnish a man. Oh, Sam... [clock chimes] [Tom groans] [backwards moaning] [breathing heavy] -* [tense music] -[Tom breathing heavy] * [tense music swells] [Tom] Writing the names of the three angels was thought to offer additional protection from the succubus, a female demon that harvests semen in order to bear demon children, often found in the form of a beautiful temptress, it gains strength from its host, for the host is thought to wither and die from the same association. [cat meows] [bell tolls] [birds chirp] [Paul] "You're the only one who can understand. You're the only one who will believe me." [Paul reading letter] "It's Bast. She's a succubus and she's stealing my life. And he's... he's the serpent and they're nesting in my house." Who's Bast? Bast was the cat goddess of ancient Egypt. It was also what Steven called his cat. I... I guess he was being funny or something. Can a... can a cat be a succubus? According to mythology, -the succubus often takes on the personification of a cat. -[Tom sighs] [Paul] I guess so. Listen... I wasn't into this stuff as much as Steven was. But, when you spend your life trying to understand the past, you realize that... that in the present anything is possible. I wanna talk to you about that woman Lillith. I got a class to teach in a couple of minutes. I will be gone for about an hour so just sit tight, alright? Here's a book... I picked up from this nut at the House of Hermetic. Check it out. I think you'll find it interesting. [wind blowing] * [tense music] [Tom] Samael Godard, born 1565, death unknown. He claimed to be the original Samael Satan, the twelve winged serpent that seduced Eve. In real life, Godard was married to Lillith Langlois, a self- proclaimed witch who borrowed her name from the mythical Lillith, Adam's first wife. Langlois was burnt at the stake in 1601... [car horns] [car screeches and crashes] [footsteps running] * [tense music continues] * [haunting disjointed music] * [haunting disjointed music continues] * [coin into pay phone] [dialing] [phone rings] Betty? Yeah, Betty, I need to talk to Alex. Please. Betty? [car engine] [dial tone] [phone put on receiver] [traffic noise] [knock on door] What are you doing here? -Betty, I need to see her. -No, I don't think-- -Please?-- -she wants to see you.-- Please?-- No.-- -Please?-- -[Alex] It's okay, mother. Let him in. [door closed] [Tom crying] They... follow me everywhere I go. Because I know that they killed him. And ah... and I know they're trying to kill me. So, I just came here to tell you that... it wasn't me. [Tom] I didn't... mean to do... I didn't mean to hurt you. -I'm sorry... I'm sorry... -Oh, my god, you're burning up. I'm hot a little. [sighs] I'm tired too. [sighs] I'm sorry. [birds chirp] Do you believe in Satan? Alex, I'm so sorry. [sobbing] I love you, Alex. I love you. I love you so much. I'll never do anything to hurt you, God, please... -Please, forgive me. -[Alex whispers] Tom... I love you. [sobbing] [Tom gasps] * [dramatic music] [sighing] [Sam] Dear Alex, I'm glad we had the talk. Like Eve, we are all tempted and most of us fall to it. I hope we can show more understanding than God did. I'm glad you listened and saw things my way. Your friend, Sam. [Mario] I think you're losing it, buddy.-- [Tom] It's the truth, Mario. It's the truth. I have proof. He's a serpent and she's a succubus. [Mario] Man, I don't care what she's sucking. You are off your rocker. You need to get in bed. [laughs] -[Mario] What's so funny? -[Tom] That's the last place I need to be is in my bed. She's trying to kill me. She's trying to fuck me to death, man. I can think of worse ways to go. She's a female demon. I'm telling ya! She's the cat. That's how she killed Cameron the same way. I have proof, it's written on the wall. He had to cut his dick off because it was the only way he could escape and now they're trying to get me, but they're not gonna get me.-- -Calm down. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy-- -They're not gonna get me. Tommy! -Tommy... I believe you. -You do? I swear I do. Bill... give my friend here a Highland Park. * [dramatic music] Make it a double. -[Tom] Thank you. -Yeah. Enjoy the drink. I'm gonna make a phone call. * [dramatic music intensifies] [breathing hard] [bar stool tipping] [woman moaning] * [haunting disjointed music] * [low growl] [woman purrs] [voices speaking backwards] [Lillith yells] [moans and meows] [Laughter] [fire billowing] [moans and meows] * [dramatic music] -[Tom whispers] Coffee. -[Coffee Server] Yeah. Regular? Decaf? Well, thank you. [sound of coins] What's the matter? What are you looking at? [Tom] What are you looking at? Are you one of... are you one of them? You're one of them, aren't you? [hot coffee spills] [customer yells and groans] What do you think you're doing? Are you nuts? [footsteps running] [car honking] [dramatic disjointed music] * [blues music] [door creeking] [Tom breathing heavily] [Laughter] * [haunting disjointed music] [breathing heavily] [Occult Man] See, the succubus is a witch. And we all know the easiest way to get rid of a witch. Burn 'em at the stake. -But I don't think you wanna go to all that trouble. -[paper crumpled] Might cause a commotion. Now, this I've been told works like magic. It's a combination of herbs from Scotland and when you burn it, it scares away all the demons. See you put the herbs in this amulet and when you wanna use it, you light a match to the herbs, carry it all around the house -and let the scent and smoke fill every room. -[paper crumpled] Now, that should do the job. Thank you. Thank you. [chuckles] [match lit] * [haunting music] [cats meow and purr] * [haunting music intensifies] -[Lillith] I've missed you, Tommy... -[Tom gasps] [smacking amulet and chain] [groans] [landing on bed] -[Lillith screeches] -[Tommy grunts and hits floor] [door slams] -[Lillith] Tommy! -[door kicked open] [body hitting shelves and tables] [objects falling] [Tom grunts and pants] [body hits floor] * [haunting music intensifies] [deep animal growl] [groans] [animal growl] [Lillith moans] [moans] [animal growl] [dagger moves on floor] [moaning] [gas igniting to flame] [Lillith screams] [fire billowing] [Lillith screams] [crackle of fire] [deep demonic screams] [Sam laughs] See you soon, neighbor. [Sam chuckles] [laughter echoes] [crackle of fire] * [music swells] * [haunting jazz fusion music] * [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] *
