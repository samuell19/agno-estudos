This is not true. This is not false. This is a fairy tale. Somerjoki, Rauli Aarre Tapani. - Yep. I admit. You wrote that due to stage fright you haven't sang in six months and - that you consider yourself unfit to work as a singer. You also mention difficulties in interacting with others. Anxiety and social phobias - make working with others overwhelmingly difficult. You say that you would like to pursue an education - yet you don't specify what kind of education you would like. But you wrote that you enjoy the solitude of nature - and like to grow and tend things. Are you perhaps talking about gardening? Am I right? I will tell you a story. Or this is more like a fairytale. This is a tale about an old rabbit. He already has some gray in his whiskers and scars here and there. I'm sure he has also got a few old pellet wounds in his butt - but he doesn't mind because he's so happy living in his rock cave. There are these wolves, though, that have become a real nuisance. In summer they just shed hair and try to put up with vermin. But in fall they are just skin and bones - and they are so hungry that their eyes are on fire. This worries the old rabbit who is not that stupid. And there is one more thing. The rabbit's name is Rauli. In my heart I have one wish I wish I would still be yours As long as I'm uncertain I can go on just by myself And in my heart I have one desire I would like to see you again Yet I am left in the grayness of another day There you go. Good girl, fat girl. You must be terribly happy, cat-happy. The comeback of Rauli Somerjoki will rip your libido. It will rearrange your tulips and make your pussycats purr. Friday at the Helsinki Hockey Arena, tickets only 50 marks. Drag your bones there. You can be saved. Hallelujah! Finally. I thought I'd remind you of the gig you promised to do. You know you are supposed to be rehearsing now. Are you there? Hello? What the fuck? Hello? Badding will rock you to heaven! The master will step into the ring! Give him a big hand. Louder! Badding is coming! The Master is here. Badding is in the building. Bring him on stage and fast. I was sitting at the bar one evening I picked up a girl She wasn't that pretty I had to have someone I had the feeling They started playing rock 'n' roll The girls started stripping Give me a little bit, she said They played a slow song People started looking at the band People yelled: Get out of here if you can't play rock 'n' roll Switch it rock 'n' roll or we'll get mad What could I do? So I played rock 'n' roll I played it all night long I played rock 'n' roll all night I played rock 'n' roll I played it all night Rauli! Goddammit, don't hang up. No more games. I'll give you one more chance to save your face. They'll pick you up tomorrow in Elvis' old Cadillac. Good enough? Too much money is invested in this. I won't let you make a fool of me. I've got my nets around you. The night falls whispering softly Someone turns on the lights in a window No one is left alone in the dark The lights will chase the shadows of the night away But I won't turn the lights on I don't think I need them You are the brightest light of all I could even say you give too much light They want to know why There are no lights on in my home Shadows are creeping in smothering Anything could happen to me They don't know that light could Frighten this tender feeling away We said, the two of us We will never turn the lights on Kalevi, dammit. Want to buy a guitar? - My name is Frans. Oh, now it's Frans. How should I know? Will you buy it? I've got to get back to Copenhagen. I came here because you asked. It's not my fault if they don't like your playing. Arde, wait! I've got a real undercover job for you. Nothing criminal, I'm a family man now. I want the car keys. - What? The car keys. You have your license? - I still do, again. I want you to get Badding here in time for the gig. - I don't know. You'll get more when he's on stage. - How can you love music so much? Jesus. - Badding. I wrote the addresses where you'll find him. Keep me informed. Let the scarred sores be Don't tear them open again Let the bitter memories die Try to forget little by little The violin in my soul has a broken string No more tender notes They are gone forever Arto Molander from the Finvox Studios. Have you seen Mr. Somerjoki? - I don't know him. This is him. Somerjoki, the rock singer. - Oh yes. Let me think. Go down those stairs. You'll come to a door. Turn the handle and the door will open. You'll find yourself outside. You can't miss it. Thank you. Rauli, I've got a surprise for you. Shall I guess? - Guess. I don't have to, I know. We old men have to stick together. Have you seen Somerjoki? Merci. One day Rauli the Rabbit leaves his cave to escape the wolves - and bumps into an old friend who he hasn't seen for years. This friend is Ossi the Squirrel. Ossi! I'm so... What? Get in the car. - Oh no. I'm on my way to see my Mom. I'll take the bus. Just get in the car. - OK then. I'll sit in the back. The tragic gauntlet of Badding. An old friend tells all. Six thousand. OK, five then. I'll do it for that. I've got to go. See you at the Hockey Arena then. You won't get in trouble for this, will you? - What do you mean? With your wife or something? - No more wives. Alright then. Ossi, things are not so great. Ossi the Squirrel guides Rauli the Rabbit to his home meadow - to his mother. That's good because he can see better from a height. He can see if there are traps or wolves lurking. Rauli, when was the last time we met? I can't remember. It was at the Vanha caf?. - I guess so. You sat there surrounded by your court like the Sun King. Did we say hello? - Barely. I was always busy then. Poor Rauli trusts Ossi wholeheartedly. How could he know that Ossi has become a wolf - who is in squirrels' clothing. But so far everything is fine. Ossi playfully drops cones to Rauli's head from the tree. It's just like when they were boys by the sunny home meadow. In love I have always counted on hard work I have listened to the birds sing and travelled around I have gone to dances ever since I was a little boy After seeing a girl home I have always broken my heart Always find someone in a dance The poison of love kills all sorrows You've got tons of condoms here. - So what. You've got lots of rubbers here. Do you remember this? Does this still work? - Of course it does. Putte! Putte, Putte! Putte, fuck off. Hey, what's your name? - Putte. Rauli. Putte-Rauli. Come here. Isn't it nasty when they're always pushing you? But if you don't plan on dying a virgin - I think you better get some new ideas. Yup. First of all, you have a body. Especially that pelvis. I think you should always use it. You don't have to get lyrical with girls, you just move. And I mean moving. You look and move, like this. This is how you do it. Let them know you have something yummy hidden in your pants. You get it? And get rid of that quiff. - Yup. Putte! Fuck Putte. If I say you're Badding, I'm not lying much. Yup. - Don't say yup, say Badding. Badding. - Again. Badding. - Badding is a good name. You see, with Badding you can have a few beers. Take a shit in your own hat, it's cool. Watch me pull now. Hi! You want to give me some? - You idiot! Ossi! - Rauli! What do you think? Is Mickey Mouse a man or a mouse? Personally I think he's a pretentious snoop - But Minnie is some bitch! Have you noticed that there are no churches in Ducksburg? That's right. Money is their religion. And Uncle Scrooge is the head priest of that. Boys! Surrounded by tall bushes is a lunatic asulym The patients have fun when the doctor's away He messes things up when he's there His mental health puzzles the patients They know he'll climb the flag pole if told so The patients are amused but also worried Mental disease rock rock rock tuberculosis rock rock rock Leuchemia rock rock rock 0ne-legged rock rock rock Diseases attack people many die For the patients the situation is unfair The staff becomes quiet The sick can't sleep 0ur friend the doctor walks by The nurses close their eyes There is tension between the doctor and patients Both are sulking Yet at times everybody's happy The doctor's good 'cause He can dance rock 'n' roll Mental disease rock rock rock Accident rock rock rock Bad heart rock rock rock Bad temper rock rock rock Everybody has their problems that's why we'll rock again. Rock! Ossi, do you have a cigarette? - I don't smoke anymore. Ossi, your hair looks kind of corny for a cop. - What? You have a cop shirt on. That makes you a narcotics cop. Geez! This is a taxi driver's shirt. - No, you're a cop bass player. You're the worst bass player in the world but the best narcs cop. Did you know that? Do you still send stuff to the magazines? - No. You made that story of me remember? - Yeah. You even took the photos with the little camera. You put that girl in the front and faded me in the background. Who was that girl. It was... Don't tell me you don't remember. My beloved one, am I the only one Promise me you'll take me away from my tearful dreams Tell me you are mine Close to you, my beloved one I want to give you everything You are not mine yet you still are Like the night and the wind that blows through me in dreams Are you alright, honey? - I'm alright, baby. Can I get you a glass of water?. - No, but I could sure use a drink. Rauli, do you think we are on an Esperanto course here? Ossi, you don't get it. I'll wait for the right time. Do you even know what two things your dick's good for? I'll take care of it, I will. I can feel your skin when I am in your arms Night brings you to my soul In the shadows I sink Darling, don't let me go The nymphs of fairytales wouldn't dance anymore A beautiful friendship would vanish in the shadows Eternity would be like ash rowing on emptiness Oili, Seija, Sirpa, Inkeri, that's Inksu. Rauli, when the summer comes I've fucked my name on this. The only letters missing are M and A. How are you going to take care of the A? That's an easy one. Ailis will always let you. But what girls do we know with an M? What's your girlfriend's name... Mari! When I've gotten my name on this pole, I'll burn this barn. Rauli had always feared this. His love for Mari the Mole was impossible. But how could a squirrel even think of loving a mole? A mole doesn't even live on the ground, it lives under it. Despite this, Rauli the Rabbit was very uneasy. And I touched my dear old boat - Is it a love poem? No, this is more about my view of life. What is it that floats in the river Challenging wind and nature Mocking man's longing When I saw that it was a log Unchained by reason I was sickened by knowledge and imprisoned again My pussy is freezing. Rauli the Rabbit's not dumb, he sees that Ossi is prettier to look at - with its bushy tail up in the trees. Rauli would just like to sit in the leaves' shadows with Mari. He would like to look her in the eye and speak softly. He wanted to say this to her but never got the nerve. Rauli, let's wait - What are we waiting for? We'll wait for the temperature to rise. This is cool, this is rock. Soon you're going to have great balls of fire. It's hot, Rauli. Look, this is rock 'n' roll. Watch the flames lick the walls. What? Are you crying? - No. Why are you crying? It's not your barn. - It's not that. Goddammit! Sometimes I feel like Sometimes I don't Sometimes I do Sometimes I don't Sometimes I feel like Sometimes I don't It was one o'clock and she asked me to give some loving And I did. Bumping and grinding Loving all night It was almost two and the girl just got wilder 0h well. Bumping and grinding Loving all night I thought it was four o'clock and she wanted more Why not?. Bumping and grinding Loving all night It was almost five o'clock and I was getting tired Well, well. Bumping and grinding Loving all night It was getting late but the girl made me give her some more. I looked at the clock but she pulled me back I'll grind. Bumping and grinding Loving all night It was seven o'clock and we went flying to heaven I'll grind. Bumping and grinding Loving all night It was almost eight and my head was aching And we were bumping We did it in the kitchen and I got sticky fingers Bumping and grinding Loving all night He's bleeding. Get some bandages here. Give him a break. Isn't it nice that they love you? Didn't you want this? You're like Elvis now. Goddammit. People can be so cruel and sadistic. These guys put a little nestling, it was still bald and blind, in a box. They kicked and shook the box and threw it in water. I cried because I could see in it. It was like I was in the box. And it still makes me so sick. Don't you jump out of my car. Goddammit. You don't jump out of my car! Ossi, you move me. - Shut up. Give me a kiss. - You're so... fuck. Walk then. - Wait. Wait. Ossi, look! What's that? A man's belly button. - No, this scar here. It was one crazy groupie. I thought she wanted to kiss but she almost ate my belly button. I had to bear it for the rest of the gig. You couldn't have left, there were two refrigerators- from the local wrestling team blocking the door. Where would you have gone? That's right, you were in the road crew then. You fixed me with duct tape, you quack. It wasn't nice when they took it off. It stuck on the hairs, you see. That served you right. Cop bass player! Rauli shot from the little village straight into a rock'n'roll star. Established stars said that he shouldn't sing the way he did. But he breathed the music. His voice was amazing. He sang like an angel, even with his asthma. He sounded like nobody else. It wasn't his fault that he looked the way he did. He probably thought about it every time he saw his reflection. People started calling him the Singing Pimple after he blew a couple of gigs. He had thought fame would make his life more worthy. It's occupied. I'm doing a shit. Come see Badding at nine at the Helsinki Hockey Arena. Buy a ticket and you could win Elvis' old Cadillac for a week. And now, as we are the radio station that knows what's happening... Cadillac. - Wartburg. You don't even have a driver's license. Sources tell us Badding wasn't in today's rehearsal. He hasn't been in any of the rehearsals. Do you want to comment on that?. - Could we focus on the real issue? Weren't we supposed to talk about us? A few more words about Badding who we haven't seen in public lately. He's a drunk. A social welfare case. A psychiatric patient. A commie. - It may seem like that. But aren't his merits in Finnish rock the core thing? Who is Badding? - For others who don't know yet, here is his song "Stars". Composed and written by Rauli Somerjoki. The dark sky with twinkling stars With its gaze so mysterious The countless stars vanish in the far distance The earth circles its small orbit again and again Stars, oh stars I would like to be close to you Stars, oh stars It would make me happier Stars, oh stars Can't I come to you? Stars, oh stars Into the eternity, beyond time It's useless to have dreams It's useless to walk that path If you give something in love it will lead to nothing Stars fade into the morning There is a glow in the east There is bitter longing in the dawning new day A beer, please. Here you are. - Thank you. A pretty smile is like dew on a cactus leaf. There are empty tables. Have you seen Somerjoki lately? He's got a concert in Helsinki. I've come to take him there. I'm not interested. It's getting dark and Rauli can already see the home meadow. Excited Mother Rabbit taps the ground, welcoming Rauli. Soon he'll see her loving eyes. Rauli! For Mother, he will always be Little Rauli. Nothing can break Mother's love. He could have made it as a rock star but he didn't want to sing rock. One of his songs was "An old halter". He cries and sings about an old horse that's going to the sausage factory. He misses that horse, dammit, and everybody is playing his songs. If Roy Orbison sings for the lonely Badding sings for the sad. In America he would have a hacienda next door to Orbison - but he couldn't handle fame. It wasn't part of his image. His identity slipped out of his hands like a soap bar. And I got tired of catching it. No way! - I need a drink. I told you no. - I need to clear my head. You can't have one before the gig. - They hate me. What? - They shout Elvis' name. I don't want to go. My God, it's always the same. I'm so ugly. Do you think Mick Jagger is beautiful? You could make a rubber dingy for two with his lips. Look at this. What does it say? I can tell you. We love you Badding. And that's you. Let's get out of here now. They should whisper things like that. - Badding and his whispering fans. Why don't you go there then? Put in earplugs then. If I was there... - People would need them. A good one. - Ossi, I need my drink. Alright, I'll get you one. - Yup. A lot of people would have traded places with him. I saw him very close. It was like he was pissing razor blades. Why was he on stage? I was more rock than he ever could be. I would have divided groopies into the ugly and the beddable. I would have enjoyed every minute of it. I would have swum deep enough yet with the snorkel above the water. I probably wasn't the only road crew member with these kinds of thoughts. When I met you it was the loveliest of nights Birds were singing and the moon was gleaming You wanted to get out of the town I thought this is going to work out fine When we got to the seashore the flowers were in bloom The sea was in whitecaps like beer We walked to the shore and undressed ourselves The moment was so intoxicating If I could just give you the most beautiful, this earth But I won't A little moment is enough When I am close to you We got tangled in an embrace and sand got caught in our toes When we fell into the hot rhythm of the sea You were joking when you said mouth to mouth - "These are things adults whisper about" They are looking on the wrong side. If I can stay here quiet, they won't find me. Or I could go under the water and breathe through a cow chervil. If they find me, they'll take me to the market - and take my clothes off and brand my face. I will never be like other people. Hello. Damn. Can you hear me? I'll get on a stump. Can you hear me? Me? I wish I knew. I don't have a clue. They told me to go to a pond. I searched, the fog got thicker and I found no pond. I just found ditches and brushwood. I didn't find the pond but I would sure like to find my car. Or a road. There must be a road there. Who has been here? - One of your friends. He said you were supposed to be singing somewhere. My friends don't smoke cigars. What did you tell him? I told him you would be at the pond. I thought he would never find you there. He said you must call him. He left a number on the table. You are not going anywhere, are you? Will you stay for dinner? I can't. - Rauli. I have to go. - Lf you are in some trouble, you can always tell me. Don't worry. No new troubles. - Oh, dear. You still sing and wander around? - No, I just whistle. You were in the magazines much more in the 70s. We watched you on TV, too. A grown man showing a belly button. I'm going to a Lions meeting. We'll donate money for a new electric organ for the school. Aren't people talking about you having a drinking problem? Your father had his share, too. You know, the sensitive guy he was. The sun was shining in the Palpakka hill Killi lifted her skirt and a teacher took off his shirt Killi was swaying a handkerchief Do the men want pussy or a drink? Killi walked in the village in a white dress A man had a big hard-on once he saw her In my heart I have one wish I wish I would still be yours As long as I'm uncertain I can go on just by myself And in my heart I have one desire I would like to see you again Yet I am left in the grayness of yet another day It wouldn't matter if I were weak I could take all the sorrows In my heart I know what is longing Now there is only Ioneliness But in my heart I know I drove you away I did it again like everyone else Mari! Rauli. How did you know I was back? - I didn't. You're shivering. Why don't you go inside? - Where are you going? I have to go to work. You can wait in the house. Your mother won't like it and there's a little kid inside. That's my daughter Veera. - Congratulations. Then I won't come. Please, come in. I don't have a man there. I'm going through rough times. - You're just drunk and cold. Let's go in. Life is chaos and swirls. Hands grasping hands and eyes locking. Moments of happiness. Sorrow. Songs of both. Someone always pays the ransom. Pays and leaves. The door is ajar and you can hear music inside. My heart started beating We need a nurse here I got trapped making a fire She is here The flame of fate She lured me into this and I got trapped What should I do when she's close She's got a devil inside but I see an angel I can't run away, should I stay I got trapped I hide in bushes She is there I take a sip of wine She looks at me invitingly What should I do She's tearing stars off her hair I comment on the weather even when I can't see a thing She winks and I am trapped She stole my soul but the fire didn't go away I had enough of fire and passed out In the morning she was in my arms again I asked if she liked it and the flame was burning me inside She turned and I got trapped again Rauli's at my house. I see. Do you know anything about a reporter being after him? - I don't. You're not playing fair now. - What? Are you talking about fair game? People haven't been fair to me, either. I was the one who cleaned after Badding threw up. I talked about nymphs in the cold woods when we had to get him on stage. I grabbed him by his ankle when he tried to jump off a bridge. I fed him like a little bird when he was hung-over. I made sure he was together all those years. So don't you talk to me about fair game. So, how old is your kid? - Veera is four. Who's the father? - You do the math. You know Badding, right? - I don't know what you're talking about. You hung out with him in the 70s. - I don't know him. You were a member of the road crew. You even look like one. Dammit. I told you I don't know the guy. Cock-a-doodle-do. Don't move or I'll kill you. Rauli the Rabbit is scared frozen because the wolves are after him. You can see their burning eyes and froth between their strong teeth. Rauli is expecting those teeth to strike his neck any moment. He could be pulled outside and fallen prey to the wolves. Fear is redness of blood under his closed eyelids. I think we'll go back to town. I'll take you home. - How much do they pay you? Are you coming home in this Cadillac? Did you drive that? Whose is it? - Let's just say it still smells of cigars. Did you kill him? It's a deal. I trust you. You're very punctual. You wanted pictures, right? Let's go outside. Wait your turn. The house is two kilometers that way. You can't miss it. You wanted to meet Badding? - You put him in the trunk? How can you do this to him? That'll be 2000 marks. I'll give a 1000. - 1800. 1500. 1800. I really despise you, Ossi. We're done. - You're crazy. Shut up. He's just a little late. We can change the schedule. The audience doesn't need to know. This will be a night to remember, for my name is Sturm und Drang. What if he doesn't show up? - Then you can shit on the stage. Again? Rauli the Rabbit is floating in the river on a tree trunk. The wolves follow him. The water turns darker. It's almost black. Here and there one can see floating mud, like clots of blood. Rauli is floating right into the wolves' cave. The wolves are howling hungrily. Rauli can smell blood. Fear makes him act and he jumps into the water. The strong current wants to swallow the little creature. The shore is so far away. Swim, Rauli. Never surrender. I am going to slash my throat. I won't sing anymore. You're not taking me anywhere. It's going to stop now. If you slash your throat what's left of you? Tell me, Rauli. Ossi, I'm really sorry. Ossi & Mari. Hi ho Silver. I'm going to stay here. When is Badding going to start? We have waited for two hours. Ma'am. I was going to tell you. I have a fifty-mark note here. Maybe it's the one you paid your ticket with. You may have worked two hours for it. Maybe you cleaned houses. You demand that for this note, soiled in your poor pockets - Badding should perform at a certain time and sober - and make you happy with all the songs that you like so much. Get me out of here! Am I in Helsinki? Watch me do something with this fruit of your diligence. Perhaps you want it back? It's value has multiplied. An artist has touched it. The audience seems ready. I'll tell you a story. There was a man named James J. Braddock. He was a heavy-weight amateur boxer. He worked in the port. One day he decided he wanted a good home for his family. He started training hard. He got ranked in the world series. Then there was Glamour Man, Max Baer. He was a real charmer and the heavy-weight champion. Braddock was supposed to be a piece of cake to him. But Braddock came and beat him and became the champion. That's how he got the name Cinderella Man. OK, I'll take some liberties with these songs. One more thing. I have a cough. Let the scarred sores be Don't tear them open again Let the bitter memories die Try to forget little by little The violin in my soul has a broken string No more tender notes They are gone forever LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR J. CHRIST Summer is withering away Fall wind is bending the trees Birds will fly far 0nly the wind is left to cry Time is lost beyond dreams The bells of rain toll for death Time sleeps in the darkness Those gray clouds tire my mind I couldn't take this anymore If I didn't know I'd see you again The sunshine takes away the winter And we'll see the spring come When the message of summer comes Brought by new green leaves on trees Time flows so fast I'll meet you half way I couldn't take this anymore If I didn't know I'd see you again The sunshine takes away the winter And we'll see the spring come Translation by Aretta V?h?l?
